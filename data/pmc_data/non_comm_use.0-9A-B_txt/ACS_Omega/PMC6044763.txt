Development of a scalable synthesis
of an oxazine class of β-secretase
inhibitor is described. Trifluoromethylated acyloin synthesis by the
reaction of a mandelic acid with trifluoroacetic anhydride in the
presence of pyridine (Dakin–West reaction) was used as an efficient
strategy to install the key trifluoromethyl substituent on the oxazine
ring. Diastereoselective addition of methyl magnesium bromide to a
cyclic sulfamidate imine and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
catalyzed intramolecular amidine formation to yield oxazine-3-amine
are some of the significant, novel synthetic methods developed in
this synthesis. These critical transformations allowed a concise 11-step
route to the target compound with excellent overall yields.

Introduction
The amyloid oligomer
protein Aβ42 has now been widely accepted
as the principal culprit behind the formation of fibrils and eventually
their deposition as plaques in the brain, a key, measurable, causative
factor suspected in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and age-related dementia.1 Many amyloid-lowering
strategies have thus been under investigation as potential interventional
therapies to arrest the progression of AD and related neurodegenerative
diseases.2 Prominent among the small molecule
drug targets actively being pursued in this approach is the enzyme
β-secretase 1 (BACE 1), which cleaves the amyloid precursor
protein (APP) to a soluble 99 amino acid peptide (C 99), the rate-determining
step in the pathway for fibrilogenic Aβ42 formation.3 Work from our laboratories has led to a series
of potent BACE 1 inhibitors.4 Among the
oxazine class of BACE 1 inhibitors, compound 1 was identified
as one of the most promising and was selected for further pharmacological
evaluation. Toward this purpose, multigram quantities of active pharmaceutical
ingredient (API) were needed. Herein, we describe development of a
new synthetic route to 1. Our primary focus has been
to replace the discovery route that suffers from poor overall yield
(<2%), use of hazardous and expensive reagents, and numerous chromatographic
purifications with a practical and step-economic route suitable for
large-scale synthesis for preclinical development
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structure of 1.

Results and Discussion
The discovery
synthesis, as outlined in Scheme 1, starts from 2-fluoro-5-bromoacetophenone,
which was converted to the amino acid, 3, using the classical
Strecker synthesis. The amino acid was then converted to the morpholinedione, 4, and then resolved by chiral chromatography. The required
trifluoromethyl group was then introduced by addition of the Ruppert–Prakash
reagent, followed by halogenation and reduction in a three-step sequence
with 38% overall yield to give the morpholin-3-one, 5, as a mixture of diastereoisomers in 4:1 ratio. Conversion to amino-oxazine 6 was accomplished by a two-step sequence by first converting
morpholin-3-one 5 to the corresponding thione, followed
by substitution with ammonia. Introduction of the amine at the 5-position
was accomplished by reaction with sodium azide with stoichiometric
copper at high temperature. Standard amide coupling with 5-cyano-pyridine-1-carboxylic
acid furnished the final product.

The discovery synthesis as outlined above, although
quite adequate
for preparation of small amounts of the final product, presented several
problems for large-scale synthesis. The main issues are (1) low throughput
in the majority of steps, (2) poor diastereoselectivity in the formation
of trifluoromethyl morpholinone 5, (3) high-temperature
azide substitution reaction to introduce the amine toward the end
of the synthesis, and (4) chromatography required for nearly all of
the intermediates.

Bearing in mind these issues, we focused
our attention on the penultimate
intermediate, 8, as our target for new route development
(Scheme 2). At the
very outset, we decided that a nitration–reduction sequence
from 10 would be the most suitable approach to install
the desired amine substituent. It was anticipated that the directing
influence of the fluorine in the electrophilic nitration would result
in the desired para substitution. We envisaged synthesis of amidine 10 from the stereochemically well-defined amino alcohol, 11.

Scheme 2 Retrosynthesis
While considering a synthetic route for the amino alcohol, 11, we recognized that an efficient approach to the tertiary
amine stereo center would be through addition of a methyl carbon nucleophile
to a suitably elaborated imine functionality. We were particularly
attracted by the elegant work of Lee and Chang5 on the addition of Grignard reagents to sulfamidate imines for the
synthesis of quaternary sulfamidate building blocks. Following their
work, we envisaged synthesis of 11, as outlined in Scheme 3, with the sulfamate
playing a remarkable role in the route from 15. It simultaneously
delivers the required nitrogen atom into the molecule, acts as a protecting
group for the alcohol, activates the imine for Grignard addition,
and locks the conformation of the protected hydroxyimine, 13, such that Grignard addition should be stereoselective. Lam and
co-workers6 have shown that the sulfamidates
like 12 can be readily cleaved by lithium aluminum hydride
(LAH) to yield the desired amino alcohol, 11.

Scheme 3 Cyclic
Sulfamate Imine Route
We now only needed ready access to trifluoromethyl acyloin, 15, which we found in an interesting variant of the Dakin–West
reaction reported by Kawase and co-workers.7 We were delighted to find that 15 could be obtained
in good yields by starting with fluoromandelic acid 14 and using trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) under the conditions
prescribed by Kawase without modification (Scheme 4). This reaction was subsequently scaled
to 200 g without the need for optimization studies; however, an exotherm
from 40 to 62 °C during addition of TFAA was observed and should
be taken into account for any larger scale development of this transformation.
The scaled reaction product, 15, was a crystalline solid8a with sufficient purity to carry forward to the
next step without additional purification.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 15
This opening transformation
established the carbon framework of
the chiral portion of the molecule in a single step from a readily
available starting material. In addition, we have introduced the trifluoromethyl
group with a relatively inexpensive reagent, TFAA, whereas the medicinal
chemistry route made use of the more expensive Ruppert–Prakash
reagent (TMSCF3) as the source of the trifluoromethyl group.8

With sufficient quantities of trifluoromethyl
acyloin 15 in hand, we proceeded to examine the forward
synthesis of amino
alcohol 11 as outlined in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Forward Synthesis of Amino Alcohol 11
Generation of cyclic
sulfamate imine 13 from acyloin 15 was performed
on a larger scale using in situ-generated
sulfamoyl chloride (Scheme 5).9 Rather than combining chlorosulfonyl
isocyanate and formic acid neat, the reagent formation was carried
out in acetonitrile (ACN), and the solution was used as is, allowing
sufficient time for reagent generation. The initial sulfamoylation
of the hydroxyl group was carried out following literature precedent
using dimethylacetamide (DMA) as the solvent.10 In the absence of DMA (e.g., using ACN as the sole solvent), no
reaction was observed until DMA was added. DMA appears to serve as
a nucleophilic catalyst to promote the sulfonylation event. After
consumption of 15 was complete, the reaction mixture
contained mostly sulfamoylated ketone 16 with a small
amount of imine 13. Upon heating the reaction to 55 °C, 16 was smoothly converted to 13. Sulfamoyl chloride
(2 equiv) is used in the reaction, with the second equivalent presumably
acting as a water scavenger to drive imine formation. With less than
2 equiv, the yield of 13 is decreased.

Addition
of methyl Grignard to 13 was expected to
have a high probability of success based on literature precedent.5 We envisaged that the addition would take place
from the least hindered face, forming diastereomer with RR/SS relative stereochemistry rac-12. However, the reaction presented difficulties with reproducibility
until it was found that using excess Grignard reagent resulted in
consistent, very clean, high-yielding (>95%) reactions in small-scale
screens (∼50–100 mg). It was also found necessary to
add the Grignard reagent at temperatures below −40 °C
(−60 °C preferable) to avoid significant impurity formation.
Using less than 1 equiv of Grignard or adding reagent at too high
a temperature resulted in dark-colored reactions that always showed
numerous impurities.

Upon addition of aqueous HCl to quench
the reaction, the clean,
high-yielding reactions always bubbled off methane gas from the quench
of unreacted methyl Grignard, as expected. The poor-quality, dark-colored
reaction mixtures uniformly did not outgas when quenched indicating
that the excess methyl Grignard had been consumed in some manner,
which presumably plays a role in the multiple side products observed
in the poor reactions.

The diastereoselectivity of the Grignard
addition was always very
high, however. NOE experiments of the product confirmed the expected RR/SS relative stereochemistry.11 The other possible diastereomer was never observed
in any reactions from which adduct rac-12 was isolated.
Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the unpurified
product consistently showed a single product peak for 12, and 1H NMR spectra of the unpurified product always
showed the presence of only one diastereomer.

On a 5 g scale
reaction, rac-12 was isolated in 95%
yield. The reaction was then scaled to 176 g, which produced rac-12 in only 67% yield. This large-scale reaction produced
the dark red-brown colored reaction mixture during the addition of
Grignard reagent that was characteristic of significant impurity formation.
As observed during small-scale reaction screening, the large-scale
reaction mixture did not outgas methane when quenched. HPLC analysis
showed the production of numerous side products; therefore, a much
more extensive purification had to be undertaken and a much lower
yield was observed than expected. It is believed that the problem
may lie with the extended time (3.5 h) required to add all of the
methyl Grignard reagent on scale, while keeping the temperature below
−40 °C. Impurity production may be the result of the anionic
product reacting with unreacted starting material in some manner during
the long addition.

If the interaction of the product and starting
material is the
cause of impurity formation, using an inverse addition protocol deserves
further scrutiny. One small-scale reaction using inverse addition
in tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) produced rac-12 cleanly. TBME itself deserves further investigation
as some small-scale reactions run in TBME may indicate that TBME could
be superior to THF. Project timelines prevented a deeper exploration
of reaction parameters, such as solvent and order of addition, to
optimize this Grignard addition on scale, but we feel that the reaction
could be improved significantly with further study.

We determined
that sulfamate rac-12 was a good candidate
for separation of enantiomers by chiral stationary-phase HPLC. Excellent
resolution of the enantiomers was achieved using the CHIRALPAK-AS
stationary phase with heptane/ethanol as the eluent. Rac-12 (100 g) was separated with near-quantitative recovery (48%) of the
desired (R,R) enantiomer.12

Desulfuration would now complete the preparation
of the key intermediate
amino alcohol 11. The cleavage of the sulfoxy group from
the molecule was accomplished by reduction with LAH based on literature
precedent.6,11 A moderate exotherm (50–63 °C)
at the initiation of the reaction should be noted, and precautions
should be taken for larger scale applications. After reaction quench
by the “Fieser” method,1211 was isolated in very high yield from the resultant
aluminum salts by simple filtration.

Scheme 6 illustrates
the completion of the synthesis in seven steps commencing with the
selective O-alkylation of 11 to give cyanomethyl ether 17. We recognized this alkylation as a potentially difficult
task. We expected that the steric hindrance around the nitrogen center
may attenuate the rate of N-alkylation, thereby favoring O-alkylation.
On the other hand, the inductive withdrawal effect of the α-trifluoromethyl
group would attenuate oxygen nucleophilicity bringing the balance
of reactivity between O- and N-alkylation into question. Furthermore,
base-mediated elimination of hydrogen fluoride might also shunt the
reaction to unproductive pathways.

Scheme 6 Complete Synthesis of 1 Starting from 11
Ultimately, the alkylation was accomplished on multigram
scale
using lithium ethoxide and bromoacetonitrile in THF at rt. Adduct 17 was obtained in 98% unpurified yield with bromoacetonitrile
as a major contaminant. Nevertheless, this material could be taken
directly into the next step without need for purification. The conditions
for this alkylation were the result of an extensive screening of combinations
of base, alkylating agent, and solvent (Table 1). The combination of lithium counterion
with bromoacetonitrile and THF singularly produced the proper balance
of nucleophile and electrophile reactivity, which delivered high-yielding
O-alkylation with minimal side products. Remarkably, alteration of
any one of these parameters resulted in much poorer reaction performance.
For example, the use of sodium or potassium alkoxides resulted in
the formation of numerous unidentified products, whereas pairing chloroacetonitrile
with a lithium alkoxide produced no reaction at all at rt. All attempts
with the weaker inorganic bases in Table 1 gave either no reaction or just a trace
of reaction. Whereas lithium ethoxide was selected for use in our
scaled-up reactions, lithium tert-butoxide behaved
similarly in smaller scale reactions. Among the other solvents screened,
DMF promoted the formation of numerous side products, whereas reactions
in methanol and ethanol showed no conversion of the starting material.

The
cyclization of 17 to amidine 10 was
promoted on scale by trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf)
with excellent results. A 99% yield of unpurified 10 was
obtained, and the material was again of sufficient purity to be carried
forward without further manipulation. These novel reaction conditions
were also born from intensive screening. We had first examined copper(I)
salts to promote the cyclic amidine formation.13−15 We found stoichiometric
quantities of CuCl to be effective giving a 79% isolated yield of
amidine in a small-scale reaction; however, we did not feel that 
using a full equivalent of a copper salt was optimum for scale-up.
In particular, there appeared to be difficulty with releasing the
amidine from copper coordination during work-up.

To find an
alternative, we initiated a screen of Brønsted
acid and Lewis acid activating agents using microwave heating for
convenience. The results of the screen are summarized in Table 2. Mineral acids at
a higher temperature (100 °C) produced decomposition or undesired
products. At a moderate temperature (60 °C), protic acids did
not decompose the starting material but also did not promote the cyclization
to amidine with good conversion. Trimethysilyl chloride was observed
to give a clean reaction but conversion was limited. Simple thermal
conditions in o-dichlorobenzene and isopropanol (IPA)
were also not successful. Interestingly, heating in hexafluoroisopropanol
yielded significantly more 10 than IPA. In addition to
CuCl, zinc salts and Cu(OTf)2 were found to give significant
conversion to amidine, and TMSOTf also showed significant, clean conversion
to amidine during screening.

We decided to further examine Zn(OTf)2 and TMSOTf (Table 3). We found that Zn(OTf)2 could be used in catalytic
amounts (5 mol %) in IPA, and
gave a 79% yield of the amidine, but the reaction was complicated
by formation of the dimeric side product, 18. The cyclization
using TMSOTf, however, was extremely clean giving a 98% yield of 10 with no further purification required. Work-up and isolation
was very simple, requiring only a quench with aqueous Na2CO3, extraction, and concentration of the organic layer.
One equivalent of TMSOTf was found to be required. Using less reagent
resulted in reduced conversion. We also determined upon further scale-up
that heating was not required. Reasonable reaction rate was observed
at rt.

TMSOTf for Cyclic Amidine Formation
We now had in place a concise six-step synthesis of
advanced intermediate 10 from 2-fluoromandelic acid that
notably establishes the
vicinal chiral centers of our target with 100% diastereoselectivity.
Most steps have been developed to high-yielding transformations, and
significant purification effort was required only for the Grignard
reaction adduct, rac-12, a problem that we feel is solvable
with further development. For expediency, we opted for chiral HPLC
for resolution during our work, but we note that the basic amine and
amidine intermediates through compound 10 may be candidates
for resolution by scalable crystallization processes.

Continuing
the route, the nitration of 10 was straightforward
in 90% fuming nitric acid, giving a high yield of desired product 9 in a 97:3 mixture with the ortho nitration isomer. To avoid
nitration of residual
toluene from the previous reaction, toluene was removed from 10 by twice concentrating the crude material from acetic acid
(AcOH). The AcOH solution of 10 was then fed directly
into the nitration. It was found advantageous to minimize the amount
of AcOH (or any other co-solvent) in this reaction, as the rate of
nitration slowed considerably with dilution of the nitric acid. For
example, the usual concentrated nitric acid (∼60% HNO3 in water) did not nitrate 10 at rt and was slow to
nitrate even at 100 °C. Reactions with no co-solvent in which
solid 10 was added directly to 90% fuming nitric acid
proceeded to completion more rapidly than reactions in which AcOH
solutions of 10 were used; nevertheless, working with 10 in AcOH solution was preferable on larger scale.

The mixture of nitration isomers was carried forward into the Boc
protection step, which occurred smoothly in acetonitrile. It was important
to eliminate all traces of AcOH from 9, as N-acetyl amidine 22 was observed as an impurity in test
reactions on initial samples of crude 9 (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Impurity 22 Arising from Boc Protection of 9
Attempts at nitro group reduction on the unpurified
mixture of 19 under typical Pd/C catalytic hydrogenation
conditions (rt,
1 atm H2) were not successful. The reactions stalled at
partial conversion from apparent catalyst poisoning. Therefore, the
decision was made to purify 19 by silica gel chromatography.
The benefit of the chromatography was that the minor nitration regioisomer, 19b, could be removed at this stage.

With purified 19a, hydrogenation of the nitro group
occurred without incident in very high yield. The nature of the catalyst
poisoning with impure 19 was not studied further nor
were alternative catalysts examined in our work.

Aniline 20 was efficiently coupled to picolinic acid 21 using the peptide coupling agent EDCI in DMF. The reaction
was initiated with 1.1 equiv each of the acid and EDCI. When the reaction
remained incomplete after repeated monitoring, an additional 0.2 equiv
of each component was introduced, and the reaction proceeded to complete
conversion. Excess reactants and spent peptide coupling by-product
were easily removed by aqueous washes, leaving the product in the
organic layer in a pure enough state to take directly into the final
deprotection.

Final Boc deprotection was accomplished in a straightforward
manner
using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane. In small-scale
experimentation, 1 was obtained in an 89:11 ratio with tert-butyl amide 24 arising from the Ritter
reaction with the liberated tert-butyl cation (Scheme 8). To solve this
problem, anisole (10 equiv) was included in the reaction to scavenge
the rogue cation, thereby completely suppressing the Ritter by-product.
Final purification of 1 was accomplished by trituration
with hot 3:1 ethanol/water, followed by partial recrystallization
from hot toluene with 43 g of 1 being delivered for in
vivo profiling.

In conclusion, choice of synthetic routes selected by
chemists
in the pharmaceutical industry is largely purpose driven. Early discovery
synthesis for example is invariably focused on routes that go through
key advanced intermediates to allow maximum flexibility for exploration
of structure–activity relationships rapidly with less emphasis
on the overall synthetic efficiency. However, as the discovery program
matures to lead candidate selection stage, the chemistry focus quickly
shifts to designing efficient, concise routes to allow preparation
of select candidate APIs on larger scale quickly for in vivo profiling.
This dichotomy in synthetic objectives is especially pronounced in
the case of complex drug molecules, which take a large number of steps
and considerable time to synthesize, as illustrated in the above example.
To summarize, a concise, 11-step synthesis of the candidate compound
has been developed. The cumulative yield for all chemical transformations
was 29%, which gives an average chemical yield per step of 89.4%.
Including the resolution step, the overall yield was 14% starting
from mandelic acid 14.

To a 20 L
jacketed
reactor was added toluene (2.7 L), mandelic acid 14 (200
g, 1.18 mol), and pyridine (570 mL, 7.05 mol). The mixture was heated
to 40 °C, and TFAA (654 mL, 4.70 mol) was added resulting in
gas evolution (CO2) and an exotherm to 62 °C. The
reaction was heated to 80 °C and stirred for 3 h. Analysis by
HPLC indicated complete consumption of the mandelic acid and generation
of a single product peak. The reaction was cooled to rt and quenched
by careful addition of 2 M HCl (2.7 L). The mixture was heated to
60 °C and stirred for 30 min. The layers were separated, and
the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2 L), dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to
give the desired product as a tan solid. The product was dried in
a vacuum oven under house vacuum (∼10 Torr) at 60 °C overnight.
Some sublimation of the product occurred in the vacuum oven. The desired
keto alcohol 15 (212 g, 81%) was isolated as a slightly
impure crystalline solid. The initial acidic aqueous layer (∼3.5
L) was found to contain the product. The acidic aqueous layer was
extracted 3 times with toluene (1:5 v/v toluene/aq. layer). The combined
toluene extracts were washed with saturated NaHCO3 (equal
volume), dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to
give more 15 (16 g, 6%). Total isolated yield = 228 g
(87%). The keto alcohol was used without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.92 (ddd, J = 7.7, 7.3, 1.8 Hz, 1H), 7.72–7.62 (m, 1H), 7.32

To a 1 L round-bottom flask
purged with N2 was added ACN (176 mL) and chlorosulfonyl
isocyanate (138 mL, 1.59 mol). The mixture was stirred with cooling
in an ice bath, while neat formic acid (60 mL, 1.59 mol) was added
slowly via syringe over 2 h, maintaining the internal temperature
below 11 °C. Gas evolution was observed. The mixture was stirred
for 1 h in the ice bath. Then, the bath was removed and the reaction
was allowed to warm to rt and stir for 21 h. The solution of sulfamoyl
chloride precipitated a small amount of white solid generating a slightly
cloudy suspension. Very slow gas evolution was still observable. The
solution of sulfamoyl chloride was used as is. Keto alcohol 15 (176.44 g, 794 mmol) and DMA (440 mL) were combined in
a 5 L jacketed reactor purged with N2. The mixture was
cooled to 0 °C, and the solution of sulfamoyl chloride in ACN
was added via cannula over 1 h, maintaining the internal temperature
below 5 °C. The reaction was allowed to warm to rt and stir for
11 h. Analysis by HPLC indicated a trace of keto alcohol remaining
with the bulk of material converted to uncyclized keto sulfamate.
There was minor conversion to the cyclic sulfamate imine final product.
To complete the cyclization to 13, the reactor was heated
to 55 °C, and the reaction was allowed to stir at this temperature
for 25 h. Analysis by HPLC showed excellent conversion to the desired
cyclic imine with just a trace of open-chain keto sulfamate visible.
The reaction was cooled to −6 °C, and water (3.1 L, 5-fold
the volume of ACN/DMA) was added to quench remaining sulfamoyl chloride
and precipitate the product. An exotherm to 23 °C was observed.
The mixture was stirred at rt for 1.5 h to complete the precipitation.
The product was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with excess
water. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven under house vacuum (∼10
Torr) at 50 °C overnight to provide 185.71 g (82%) of crude 13 as a tan solid. To purify the crude product, the material
was redissolved in hot 15% toluene/heptane (10 mL/g crude product)
in a 5 L jacketed reactor (solution temperature, 95 °C) leaving
an undissolved dark red-brown gummy residue on the walls of the flask.
The hot solution was drained from the reactor into two 2 L Erlenmeyer
flasks. The solutions were agitated with magnetic stirring and allowed
to slowly cool and crystallize. The product was collected by vacuum
filtration, washed with excess 15% toluene/heptane, and dried under
house vacuum at 50 °C overnight to provide 163 g (72%) of 13 as an off-white crystalline solid. The mother liquor was
concentrated and purified by flash chromatography (330 silica gel
cartridge, 5–70% EtOAc/hexanes gradient, 40 mL/min). Fractions
containing the product were combined and concentrated to give an impure
product, which was recrystallized from hot 15% toluene/heptane as
before to provide a further 12.3 g (5%) of the desired imine. Total
isolated yield = 175.3 g (77%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.08 (ddd, J = 8.0, 7.2,

Racemic 4-(2-Fluorophenyl)-4-methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3-oxathiazolidine
2,2-dioxide (rac-12)
A 3 L three-necked round-bottom
flask was fitted with mechanical stirring, purged with N2 (g), and charged with sulfamate imine 13 (178.77 g,
631.2 mmol) and THF (1.26 L). The solution was cooled to −67
°C in a dry ice/IPA bath and treated dropwise via cannula with
MeMgBr (295 mL of a 3.0 M solution in Et2O, 883.7 mmol)
over 3.5 h, while keeping the internal temperature below −60
°C. The mixture took on a dark red coloration during the addition.
The reaction was allowed to warm to −10 °C over 4 h, then
was quenched by addition of 2 M HCl (500 mL). No gas evolution was
observed. Layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted
twice with TBME (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were
dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give the crude product
as a dark orange semisolid. The crude product was dissolved in hot
40% IPA/heptane (400 mL) and allowed to cool and crystallize overnight,
producing large, translucent crystals infused with a dark green color.
The crystals were broken up, collected by vacuum filtration, and washed
with 60% IPA/heptane. The product was dried in a vacuum oven under
house vacuum (∼10 Torr) at 60 °C for 2 days. Some sublimation
of the product was observed. The initial product (95 g) was obtained
as large dark brown to black colored crystals. HPLC and 1H NMR analysis indicated excellent purity. To decolorize the product,
the crystals were dissolved in warm TBME (21 mL/g) and treated with
activated charcoal (10 wt %). The charcoal was removed by filtration
through a pad of Celite, and the filter cake was washed with excess
TBME. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give the first crop of rac-12 (93.83 g, 50%) as a white solid. The mother liquor
from the first crystallization was partially concentrated at elevated
temperature and allowed to cool and crystallize. The crystals were
slurried with additional 60% IPA/heptane, collected by suction filtration,
washed with 60% IPA/heptane, and dried to give a second crop of the
product (∼13 g). A third crop (∼7 g) was obtained from
the mother liquor in the same manner as above. The second and third
crops were combined and treated with activated charcoal in the same
manner as described above to provide the product (20.6 g, 11%) as
a white to off-white solid. The remaining mother liquor was concentrated
and passed through a 2.5 in. silica gel plug in a 2 L fritted funnel
eluting with a gradient of 10% EtOAc/hexanes to 50% EtOAc/hexanes.
Product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated to give
a thick red-orange oil, which precipitated more product upon cooling.
The viscous mother liquor was decanted off, and the solid was slurried
in 40% IPA/heptane, collected by vacuum filtration, and air dried
to give a fourth crop (∼11 g). The mother liquors from crop
4 were combined, concentrated, and chromatographed (330 g silica gel
cartridge, 5–50% EtOAc/hexanes gradient, 60 mL/min). Product-containing
fractions were partially concentrated and allowed to crystallize.
The crystals were slurried in 40% IPA/heptane and collected by vacuum
filtration to give a fifth crop of the product (∼5 g). Crops
4 and 5 were combined and treated with activated charcoal as above
to provide a final batch of the product (15.7 g, 8%). Total combined

(11)
To a 2 L round-bottom three-necked flask
fitted with mechanical stirring was added cyclic sulfamate 12 (48.0 g, 160.4 mmol) and THF (450 mL). The homogeneous mixture was
heated to 50 °C, and crushed pellets of LAH (10.07 g, 265.3 mmol)
were added in portions. Vigorous gas evolution and an exotherm to
63 °C were observed. Analysis by HPLC after 30 min indicated
unreacted sulfamate. Additional solid LAH (1.83 g, 48.1 mmol) was
added. Analysis by HPLC after an additional 30 min showed complete
consumption of the sulfamate. The mixture was cooled in an ice bath
to 5 °C and quenched by careful addition of water (12 mL), while
maintaining the internal temperature below 20 °C. Vigorous gas
evolution was observed during the initial quench. The mixture was
stirred for 30 min during which time the reaction became thick and
gelled. The ice bath was removed, and more THF (50 mL) was added.
Aqueous 15% NaOH solution (12 mL) was added, and the gel began to
break down. After stirring for 30 min, water (36 mL) was added in
one portion, and the mixture was stirred overnight, resulting in a
gray suspension. Celite (30 g) was added and allowed to mix well with
the suspension to aid filtration. After several minutes of stirring,
the suspension was filtered through a pad of Celite. The filter cake
was washed with excess THF, and the solvent was removed in vacuo on
a rotary evaporator. After the bulk of the solvent was removed, the
product was dried at 67 °C on the rotary evaporator for 30 min,
then was placed under high vacuum for 3 h, while cooling to rt. Yield
= 37.3 g (98%), pale yellow solid. The amino alcohol was used without
further purification. [α]D20 = −17.6° (c =

(17)
To a solution of the unpurified amino alcohol 11 (36.81 g, 155.2 mmol) in THF (155 mL) at rt was added LiOEt
(200 mL of 1 M solution in THF, 200 mmol, and 4.1 g of solid LiOEt,
79 mmol). Bromoacetonitrile (16.5 mL, 248.3 mmol) was added immediately
in one portion. The mixture was stirred at rt overnight. Analysis
by HPLC after 16 h indicated incomplete conversion of 11. More solid LiOEt (0.81 g, 15.5 mmol) and bromoacetonitrile (1.0
mL, 15.5 mmol) were added. Analysis by HPLC after 2 h showed further
conversion of the amino alcohol, but unreacted 11 was
still present. A third aliquot of solid LiOEt (0.81 g, 15.5 mmol)
and bromoacetonitrile (1.0 mL, 15.5 mmol) was added. Analysis by HPLC
after 2 h indicated complete consumption of 11. The reaction
was quenched by addition of saturated NH4Cl (1 L). The
biphasic mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was partially
concentrated to remove the bulk of the THF, and the remaining aqueous
layer was extracted three times with TBME (500 mL, then 2 × 300
mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), and the drying agent was removed by filtration. The dark
orange organic layer (1.2 L) was treated with activated charcoal (4.3
g, 10 wt %) and heated at 40 °C, while spinning on a rotary evaporator
for 30 min. The mixture was cooled to rt, and the charcoal was removed
by filtration through a pad of Celite. The filter cake was washed
with excess TBME. The coloration of the filtrate was significantly
lighter after the charcoal treatment. The TBME was removed in vacuo
leaving the crude product as a dark orange liquid. 1H NMR
indicated the product contained bromoacetonitrile (11.7 mol %, 5.4
wt %). To reduce bromoacetonitrile contamination, the product was
allowed to stand under high vacuum at rt for 2 d. 1H NMR
showed that the bromoacetonitrile content was 4.8 mol %, 2.2 wt %.
Mass recovery = 43.15 g. Yield of 17 corrected for bromoacetonitrile
content = 42.2 g (98%). This material was used without further purification.

To a stirred
solution of the unpurified amino cyanomethyl ether 17 (41.8 g, 151.3 mmol) in toluene (756 mL) at rt was added TMSOTf
(27.4 mL, 151.3 mmol) in one portion. A very mild exotherm to 26 °C
was observed within 5 min of addition. A drying tube was placed on
the flask, and the reaction was stirred at rt for 1.5 h. Analysis
by HPLC indicated complete conversion of 17. The reaction
was quenched by addition of 10% aqueous Na2CO3 (450 mL), and the biphasic mixture was stirred overnight at rt.
Layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with
toluene (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried
(Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo at 60 °C
to give crude amidine 10 as a viscous dark orange oil,
which was placed under high vacuum for several minutes to remove solvent. 1H NMR indicated that the toluene content was 3.6 wt %. Yield
of 10 corrected for toluene content = 41.4 g (99%). The

(5R,6R)-5-(2-Fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)-5-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-1,4-oxazin-3-amine (9)
To eliminate
toluene from 10 before nitration, the amidine (40.9 g,
148 mmol) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (AcOH) (100 mL) and
concentrated in vacuo at 60 °C. Another aliquot of AcOH (100
mL) was added, and the solution was partially concentrated to a volume
of approximately 45 mL. The resulting solution of amidine 10 in AcOH was free of toluene, as indicated by 1H NMR analysis.
The solution of 10 in a 2 L round-bottom flask was cooled
to 0 °C in an ice bath. Fuming nitric acid (90% HNO3) (200 mL) was cooled to −20 °C and then added in portions
to the ice cold solution of 10 in AcOH. The reaction
gave a moderate exotherm to 34 °C during addition. The final
ratio of HNO3 to AcOH was approximately 4.4:1 (v/v). When
addition was complete, the reaction was stirred for 5 min in the ice
bath. The ice bath was then removed, and the reaction was allowed
to warm to rt and stirred overnight. Analysis by HPLC and MS indicated
complete consumption of 10 with clean formation of the
nitrated products. The reaction was diluted with ice (200 g) and water
(200 mL), causing precipitation of a solid (presumably the nitric
acid salt of 10). EtOAc (500 mL) was added, and the mixture
was cooled on ice as the aqueous layer was basified with NaOH. Initially,
solid NaOH was added until the pH reached 5–6, and then aqueous
NaOH solution was added until pH 8. The layers were separated, and
the aqueous layer was further basified to pH 10 and extracted twice
with EtOAc (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers (dark orange)
were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to give
the product as a foam. This crude material was found to contain significant
quantities of AcOH; therefore, the foam was redissolved in TBME (1
L) and washed 4 times with 0.5 M NaOH (4 × 200 mL). The organic
layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to
give 53.74 g of the mixture of nitration isomers as a dark orange
viscous oil with TBME (15 wt %) and EtOAc (0.6 wt %) contamination
as indicted by 1H NMR analysis. Yield corrected for solvent
contamination = 45.36 g (95%). This material was used without further
purification. Spectral data for 9: [α]D20 = −99.3°

To a stirred solution of the mixture of nitrated amidines (44.85
g, 139.6 mmol) in ACN (280 mL) was added Boc anhydride (Boc2O) (45.71 g, 209.4 mmol). The reaction was heated to 50 °C and
allowed to stir until HPLC analysis indicated complete consumption
of amidine (15.5 h). To scavenge unreacted Boc2O, the reaction
was cooled in an ice bath and treated with N-methylpiperazine
(10.8 mL, 98 mmol). A mild exotherm and gas evolution were observed.
The reaction was allowed to warm to rt and stir for 2 h. Most of the
ACN was removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in TBME (500
mL) and washed 3 times with 2 M HCl (3 × 50 mL), once with 1:1
saturated NaHCO3/water (100 mL) and once with brine (100

to give the mixture of Boc-amidines as a viscous orange oil, which
was purified by flash chromatography (750 g silica gel cartridge,
hexanes to 40% EtOAc/hexanes gradient) to provide 57.56 g of the desired

To
a 2 L round-bottom flask were added 19a (53.03 g, 125.8
mmol), 10% Pd/C (Aldrich, dry) (5.3 g), and THF (265 mL, 5 mL/g nitro

overnight. Analysis by HPLC showed that the reaction was approximately
50% complete. The reaction contents were transferred to a 2 L Parr
bottle and placed on a shaker under 40 psi of H2 (g) for
4 h. Analysis by HPLC indicated complete consumption of 19a with formation of a single product. The Pd catalyst was removed
by filtration through a pad of Celite, and the filter cake was washed
with excess THF to give a solution of the product that was pale lavender
in color. The solution was dried (MgSO4) and then filtered
through a 1 in. plug of silica gel eluting with excess THF to remove

tert-Butyl (5R,6R)-5-(5-(5-Cyanopicolinamido)-2-fluorophenyl)-5-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro-2H-1,4-oxazin-3-yl)carbamate (23)
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDCI) (23.72 g, 123.8 mmol) was added in one portion
to a rt solution of 20 (44.03 g, 112.5 mmol) and 5-cyanopicolinic
acid (21) (18.33 g, 123.8 mmol) in DMF (240 mL). Analysis
by HPLC after 1 h showed significant conversion, but the reaction
was not complete. After 7 h, there was no further conversion. Second
portions of EDCI (4.31 g, 22.5 mmol) and picolinic acid 21 (3.33 g, 22.5 mmol) were added, and the reaction was stirred for
1 h. Analysis by HPLC indicated complete conversion of 20. The DMF was removed in vacuo with the rotary evaporator bath temperature
at 40 °C. The bright orange residue was partitioned between TBME
(500 mL) and 0.5 M HCl (200 mL). Layers were separated. The organic
layer was washed a second time with 0.5 M HCl causing a precipitate,
which was determined to be the product, to form in the separatory
funnel. Ethyl acetate (300 mL) was added to bring the product into
solution. The organic layer was washed once more with 0.5 M HCl (200
mL), then was washed twice with 5% Na2CO3 (2
× 100 mL) and once with brine (300 mL). The organic layer was
dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. The off-white solid was
dried under high vacuum for 2 h at rt to give 62.13 g of the coupled
product. 1H NMR analysis indicated contamination by EtOAc
(0.6 wt %) and TBME (0.1 wt %). Yield corrected for solvent contamination
= 61.70 g (94%). This material was used without further purification.

N-(3-((2R,3R)-5-Amino-3-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-3,6-dihydro-2H-1,4-oxazin-3-yl)-4-fluorophenyl)-5-cyanopicolinamide (1)
To a rt solution of Boc-amidine (61.73 g, 118.4
mmol)
and anisole (129 mL, 1.18 mol) in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (800 mL) was added trifluoroacetic acid (200 mL). Analysis
by HPLC after 4 h indicated complete removal of the Boc group. Volatiles
were removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation with the water bath set
at 40 °C. The thick orange residue was taken up in ethyl acetate
(EtOAc) (500 mL) and washed 3 times with 10% Na2CO3 (3 × 300 mL) and once with brine (200 mL). The organic
layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to
give a moist off-white solid that contained significant anisole. The
material was dried further in vacuo under rotary evaporation with
the water bath set at 60 °C. The resulting crude solid was triturated
with hot 3:1 ethanol/water (100 mL) for 20 min by spinning on the
rotary evaporator with the water bath set at 92 °C. The suspension
was cooled to 7 °C, and the product was collected by vacuum filtration
and washed with cold quantities of 3:1 ethanol/water. The solid was
dried in a vacuum oven under house vacuum (∼10 Torr) at 70
°C overnight. 1H NMR analysis indicated 4.5 wt % ethanol
content. The product was then triturated and partially recrystallized
from hot toluene, as described. Toluene (approximately 700 mL) was
added to the solid, and the mixture was heated to 100 °C with
rapid stirring. The solid was partially dissolved after stirring for
20 min. The mixture was removed from heat and allowed to cool and
crystallize. When the temperature of the solution had reached rt,
the flask was placed in the freezer and cooled to −5 °C.
The product was collected by vacuum filtration and washed first with
cold toluene, then with warm heptane. The finely divided white solid
was dried under high vacuum (∼50 mTorr) at 70 °C overnight
to provide 43.55 g (87%) of 1. Mp 242 °C (decomp). 1H NMR analysis indicated the toluene content to be 0.3 wt
%. [α]D20 = −11.2° (c = 1.0, DMF). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 10.77 (s, 1H), 9.20
