Owing
to the peculiar broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities of
zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), we envisaged their use to treat
bacterial/mycobacterial/fungal infections during peritoneal dialysis
(PD) of end-stage renal failure patients. However, a recent study
from our lab showed that ZnO-NPs cannot be employed for the same in
their naked form owing to their rapid agglomeration. Also, the naked
ZnO-NPs showed strong interaction with organic acids present in the
PD fluid (i.e., lactate and citrate present abundantly in almost all
biological fluids) resulting in the formation of bioconjugates. Here,
we propose that the surface coating of ZnO NPs may inhibit the binding
interactions of NPs with the constituents of PD fluid. Therefore,
in this study, we have carried out the surface coating of ZnO NPs
with polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights, followed
by the investigations of physicochemical properties of PEGylated ZnO
NPs dispersed in PD fluid using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The interaction
of PEGylated ZnO NPs has also been studied separately in glucose and
lactic acid which are the main constituents of PD fluid and in citric
acid. Although the X-ray diffraction and TEM results infer the colloidal
stability of PEGylated ZnO NPs in PD fluid, FT-IR, UV–vis,
and nuclear magnetic resonance
results revealed the binding interactions of PEGylated ZnO NPs with
the PD constituents. PEGylated ZnO NPs also interact strongly with
the lactic acid and citric acid, leading to agglomeration, as observed
previously for uncoated ZnO NPs. Further, the antibacterial activities
of bare and PEG-coated ZnO NPs dispersion in PD fluid have been studied.
A reduction in the bacterial inhibition effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia
coli was observed for both the bare and PEG-coated
ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid, indicating that the complex nature
of PD fluid counteract on the efficiency of these nanobiotics.

Introduction
Peritoneal dialysis
(PD) is a well-established therapy used for
the treatment of patients with end-stage renal failure.1 Prolonged PD therapy is often associated with
a high risk of infection of the peritoneum, subcutaneous tunnel, and
catheter exit site.2,3 The recurrent and persistent infections
many times lead to malfunctioning of peritoneal membrane, a condition
known as infectious peritonitis, which is the main cause of mortality
and morbidity in PD patients.4,5 Further, owing to weak
and sabotaged immune system, the PD patients frequently require higher
antibiotic dose to resolve the infection condition. However, the frequent
intraperitoneal administration of higher antibiotic doses and their
absorption through the peritoneum lead to serious side effects including
peritoneal malfunctioning, hepatotoxicity, and multiple drug resistance
(MDR). Therefore, there is an unmet need for alternative advances
other than antibiotics to deal with the MDR bacterial strains in PD
patients and hence to reduce the frequency of life-threatening episodes
of infectious peritonitis. Owing to their broad spectrum antimicrobial
activity, the metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed as
alternative agents for the management of PD-related infections.6 Among the various metal oxide antimicrobial nanomaterials,
zinc oxide NPs (ZnO NPs) exhibit excellent antibacterial and antifungal
activities.7−12 But, before incorporation of any NPs in biological systems, the
understanding of their stability and interaction with the biological
fluids such as plasma and serum is very much essential.

Generally,
the NPs surface could adsorb the components of biological
fluids (e.g., electrolytes, proteins, lipids, and metabolites) leading
to the formation of a protein corona (PC) which may affect their antimicrobial
activity.13−17 PD fluid is also a complex mixture of sodium, chloride, calcium,
magnesium, lactic acid, and glucose which may get adsorbed onto the
surfaces of NPs. Recently, we have investigated the detailed physicochemical
properties of ZnO NPs dispersed in sterile PD fluid to explore if
any such interactions and adsorption occur.18 It is found that ZnO NPs selectively interacts and binds with lactic
acid, the main constituent of PD fluid rendering the NPs with a new
biological identity. We presume that the surface modification of ZnO
NPs may decrease the tendency of ZnO NPs to interact with the components
of PD fluid. Among the various types of polymer coatings, the surface
coating of NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) was found to be efficacious,
making the NP system biologically compatible and partly reducing their
cytotoxicity. In vivo compatibility is imparted owing to its ability
to enhance the solution solubility and to limit the binding of NPs
to blood proteins and macrophages, as well.19−21 Therefore,
in the present study, we first carried out the surface coating of
ZnO NPs with PEG, followed by the investigation of the effect of such
surface modification on their colloidal stability in PD fluid and
interaction with PD constituents. The interaction study of PEGylated
ZnO NPs has also been carried out separately in glucose and lactic
acid, which are the main constituents of PD fluid and in citric acid,
the most abundant organic acid found in biological fluids. Further,
the antimicrobial activity of ZnO NPs and PEG-capped ZnO NPs dispersed
in PD fluid has been carried out and presented here.

Results and Discussion
PEGylated ZnO NPs have been obtained by adsorption of PEG molecules
onto the surface of ZnO NPs (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The adsorption of the PEG was confirmed using
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA curves shown in Figure S2 for PEG-6000- and PEG-200-coated ZnO
NPs reveals significant weight loss during the TGA test with two successive
thermal transitions for both of the samples. The first transition
up to 150 °C is attributed to water molecules on the surface
of NPs, and the second consecutive transition observed in the range
of 380–450 °C can be attributed to the decomposition of
PEG molecules from the surface of ZnO NPs, as reported previously.22,23 The TGA curve depicts a net weight loss of 3 and 2.62% for PEG-6000-
and PEG-200-coated ZnO NPs, respectively. The corresponding molar
percentage of adsorbed PEG polymer on ZnO NPs was found to be 5 ×
10–4 and 1.3 × 10–2 for PEG-6000
and PEG-200, respectively. These results revealed that the amount
of adsorption of PEG molecules on the surface of NPs decreases with
increase in the molecular weight of PEG which is in agreement with
the previous studies.22Figure 1A,B shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of bare ZnO NPs and PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs. The observed
peaks in the XRD pattern of ZnO NPs are well-indexed to hexagonal
wurtzite structure.18 The absence of any
other characteristic impurity peaks confirms the phase purity of the
NPs. It can be seen that the PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs have similar
XRD pattern as that of ZnO NPs indicating no effect of surface coating
on the crystal structure of ZnO NPs. Further, we do not find any significant
change in XRD patterns of PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid,
lactic acid, glucose, and citric acid, as shown in Figure 1C–F, respectively, inferring
no influence on the crystallinity of ZnO NPs. The retention of crystallinity
of PEGylated ZnO NPs in the presence of PD fluid, lactic acid, and
citric acid is an interesting observation owing to the fact that the
uncapped/bare ZnO NPs have lost their crystallinity to a maximum extent
in the presence of these biological fluids.18 Similar results were observed for PEG-200-capped ZnO NPs, as depicted
in Figure S3A–F.

NPs, (B) PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs, and PEGylated

The size and morphological
features of ZnO NPs, and PEG-6000- and
PEG-200-capped ZnO NPs dispersed in deionized water, PD fluid, glucose,
lactic acid, and citric acid were determined using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (as shown in Figures 2A–F and S4A–F). It can be seen that bare ZnO NPs are well-dispersed having a spherical
morphology with some elongated particles and particle-size distribution
in the range of 20–50 nm, as shown in Figure 2G, with the average particle size of 31 ±
8 nm. Although a small degree of aggregation is seen for PEGylated
ZnO NPs, we do not find any significant change in particle size both
for PEG-6000 and PEG-200 capping. Although no morphological change
was observed for PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid and glucose,
a complete agglomeration-forming clusters of NPs were seen for PEGylated
ZnO NPs dispersed in lactic and citric acid similar to what was observed
previously for bare ZnO NPs dispersed in lactic and citric acid.18 Strikingly, PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD
fluid do not lead to any agglomeration which is contrary to the previous
results observed for bare NPs inferring the enhanced colloidal stability
of surface-coated ZnO NPs in the PD fluid.

NPs, (B) PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs, and PEGylated

(F) citric acid. The particle size distribution histograms for ZnO
NPs and PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in deionized water, PD fluid,
and glucose are displayed in (G–J), respectively. Red solid
lines are the Gaussian fitting to the distribution.

The FT-IR absorption spectra of PEG, ZnO NPs, and PEGylated
ZnO
NPs, shown in Figure S5, confirm the surface
coating of ZnO NPs with PEG. The FT-IR spectrum of bare ZnO NPs showed
the presence of Zn–O bond characteristic absorption peak at
∼525 cm–1 and the broad band at ∼3440
cm–1, assigned to the characteristic absorption
of the hydroxyl group (O–H). The surface adsorption of PEG
on ZnO NPs is evident from the absorption peaks observed at 2930 and
2850 cm–1 because of the asymmetric and symmetric
C–H stretching mode of −CH2– groups
of PEG, C–O stretch coupled with C–C stretching peaks
seen between 1050 and 1200 cm–1, and C–O–H
bending vibration at 1400 cm–1, respectively.24 The peak observed at 830 cm–1 can be attributed to C–CH aliphatic deformation vibration
of the C–H bond. The interaction and binding of PEGylated ZnO
NPs with PD fluid, glucose, lactic acid, and citric acid were also
investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure 3). We do not find any significant change
in the FT-IR spectra of PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in glucose, as
shown in Figure 3A,
respectively, inferring no interaction of PEGylated ZnO NPs with glucose.
However, the FTIR spectra of PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid,
lactic acid, and citric acid show a redshift of ∼130, 140,
and 170 cm–1 in the C=O stretching band with
respect to that observed at 1730 cm–1 for free lactic
acid and citric acid, confirming the interaction and binding of lactic
acid and citric acid molecules with PEGylated ZnO NPs. Table S1 depicts the comparison of the observed
C=O stretching frequency in the FT-IR spectra of bare ZnO NPs,
PEG-6000-coated ZnO NPs, and PEG-200-coated ZnO NPs dispersed in various
media. The observed redshift in the FT-IR spectra of PEG-6000-coated
ZnO NPs and PEG-200-coated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid, lactic acid,
and citric acid is similar to the values, as reported previously,
for bare ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid, lactic acid, and citric acid.18

acid, and (D) citric acid and PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in citric
acid.

The size and surface properties
of PEG-6000- and PEG-200-capped
ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid were further investigated using dynamic
light scattering (DLS) technique. The corresponding zeta size and
zeta potential are enlisted in Tables 1 and S2. The average particle
size distribution and zeta potential for bare ZnO NPs in deionized
water was 69 nm and 36.6 mV, respectively. After PEGylation, the average
size distribution was found to be ∼485 nm for PEG-6000-capped
ZnO NPs because of the increase in the surface hydrophilicity leading
to enhanced hydrodynamic diameter. The observed decrease in surface
charge of ZnO NPs after PEGylation is in accordance with the previous
reports.25 Further, we do not observe any
significant change in size distribution for PEG-coated ZnO NPs dispersed
in glucose. However, a significant increase in size distribution was
observed for PEG-coated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid, lactic acid,
and citric acid, as shown in Table 1. The observed discrepancy in the DLS and TEM particle
size distribution of NPs dispersed in PD fluid could be because of
the effect of altered surface conjugation/interaction of NPs in the
PD fluid along with the small extent of aggregation, as seen in TEM
images. DLS and TEM have been reported to give similar particle size
distribution for monodisperse samples; however, the DLS results contradict
with TEM analysis for polydisperse samples.26,27 This is because of the fact that DLS is an intensity-based technique,
and the measured analytical signal in DLS is directly proportional
to the sixth power of particle diameter (d6). Therefore, for polydisperse systems, the scattered light from
larger particles or aggregates will strongly mask the weaker light
scattering from the smaller NPs. Further, the diffusion coefficient
of NPs has also been reported to change upon the conjugation/interaction
of biomolecules with the surface of NPs, which also affects the DLS
measurements significantly.28 Zeta potential
of PEG-6000-coated ZnO NPs has been found to decrease to +3.44, −4.37,
and +2.16 mV when dispersed in PD fluid, lactic acid, and citric acid,
respectively. Similar decrease in surface charge was observed previously
for bare ZnO NPs.18 These results suggest
that PEGylation of ZnO NPs is not effective in preventing the lactate
and citrate ion interaction and/or adsorption onto the particle surface.

The UV–vis
absorption spectra of PEG-6000- and PEG-200-coated
ZnO NPs dispersed in deionized water exhibit a characteristic absorption
peak at a wavelength of 363 and 368 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure S6A,B. This peak has been found to be
red-shifted by 5 and 10 nm when compared to bare ZnO NPs (λmax ≈ 358 nm) which might be because of the adsorption
of PEG on ZnO NPs surface. The band gap energy of PEG-6000- and PEG-200-coated
ZnO NPs, as calculated using the Tauc relation εhυ = C(hυ – Eg)1/2, comes out to be 3.26 and 3.19
eV, respectively, which is less than that observed for bare ZnO NPs
(∼3.29 eV), confirming the binding of PEG molecules onto the
surface of ZnO NPs. Table S3 shows the
comparison of the band gap energies for bare and PEGylated ZnO NPs
dispersed in various media. The band gap energy was further found
to be decreased for PEGylated ZnO NPs when dispersed in PD fluid,
lactic acid, and citric acid similar to that observed previously for
bare ZnO NPs inferring the interaction of PD constituents with PEG-coated
ZnO NPs.

The time-course UV–vis absorption study of PEG-6000-capped
ZnO NPs dispersed in deionized water and glucose does not reveal any
change in the intensity of absorption maxima (data not shown for glucose),
whereas the dispersion of these coated NPs in PD fluid (Figure 4A), lactic acid (Figure 4B), and citric acid (Figure 4C) showed a drop
in the intensity of absorption maxima with increase in time, confirming
the interaction of PEGylated NPs with lactate and citrate ions. Similar
findings were observed for PEG-200-capped ZnO NPs, as shown in Figure S7. Further, the maxima has been observed
to be red-shifted to 370 and 372 nm for PEG-6000- and PEG-200-capped
ZnO NPs dispersed in the PD fluid, respectively, inferring the interaction
of PD components with the NPs. Figure 4D–F shows the plots of change in absorption
intensity as a function of time for PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs dispersed
in the PD fluid, lactic acid, and citric acid, respectively. Similar
plots were shown for PEG-200-capped ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid,
lactic acid, and citric acid in Figure S7D, E and F, respectively. The curves were fitted with the following
exponential association equation based on Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm of Microcal Origin 7.5 (inset of Figure 4D–F) to determine the reaction kinetics  where I0 and It are the absorption intensities
at time zero and t, respectively. The constant A1 is the relative contribution and t1 is the corresponding time constant of mechanism involved
in interaction between PEGylated ZnO NPs and the solution constituents.
The value for t1 comes out to be 62 ±
7, 15 ± 2, and 14 ± 1 min for PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs dispersed
in PD fluid, lactic acid, and citric acid, respectively. The obtained t1 values were compared with those reported for
bare ZnO NPs, as demonstrated in Table S3. We found that the t1 value for PEGylated
ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid has been found to be two times greater
than the values reported for bare ZnO NPs in PD fluid. The increase
in the time of interaction between PEGylated ZnO NPs and the components
of PD fluid suggest that the PEG surface coating affects the interaction
of ZnO NPs with PD constituents but do not completely suppress the
interaction.

One-dimensional (1D)
proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic
experiments were also carried out to study the interaction of PEGylated
ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid, lactic acid, and citric acid. Figure 5A–C shows
the stacked 1H NMR spectra of PD fluid, lactic acid, and
citric acid containing different concentrations of PEG-6000-capped
ZnO NPs (0.0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/mL). A significant broadening
of lactate resonances (at 1.3 and 4.1 ppm) can be seen with a very
small change in the intensity of these peaks in NMR spectra of PD
fluid up to 4 mg PEGylated ZnO NPs PD dispersion above which a sharp
decrease in the intensity was marked. On the other hand, a significant
decrease in the intensity of lactate and citrate resonances was observed
even for 0.5 mg PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs dispersed in lactic acid and
citric acid, respectively. Similar results were observed for PEG-200-capped
ZnO NPs dispersed in the PD fluid, lactic acid, and citric acid, as
shown in Figure S8A–C, respectively.

(B) lactic acid, and (C) citric acid containing different concentrations
of PEG-6000-capped ZnO NPs (0.0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg/mL).

The reduced intensity of lactate and citrate resonances
points
toward the interaction of lactate and citrate ions with PEGylated
ZnO NPs similar to that observed previously for bare ZnO NPs. The
minimal intensity changes upon addition of the PEGylated ZnO NPs up
to 4 mg and increased t1 values along
with their dispersed nature in PD fluid in TEM images, essentially
establish that the surface modification/PEGylation enhanced the colloidal
stability to a significant extent when these NPs are present at low
concentrations in PD fluid.

The antibacterial activities of
ZnO NPs and PEGylated ZnO NPs colloidal
suspensions were investigated against the Staphylococcus
aureus and Escherichia coli strains, and the plots of inhibitory rate as a function of time
are shown in Figures 6 and S9 for 0.5 and 1 mg/mL concentration,
respectively. Inhibitory rate represents the change in absorbance
with respect to control (no treatment). We observed a small decrease
of ∼10–20% in the inhibition rate of PEGylated ZnO NPs
when compared to bare ZnO NPs. The observed decrease in the inhibition
effect of PEGylated ZnO NPs compared to bare ZnO NPs is in line with
the previous studies where cytotoxicity of PEG-coated ZnO NPs has
been reported to reduce because of the decreased cellular uptake arising
from a minimal PC.29 We have also measured
the growth curves for PEG-6000 and PEG-200 polymers (with the concentration
of 0.2 mg/mL equivalent to the percentage molar mass of PEG-200 on
the surface of ZnO NPs, as obtained from the TGA results) for both S. aureus and E. coli strains, and the results are presented in Figure S10A,B, respectively. No change in growth was seen for both
the PEG-6000 and PEG-200 polymers when compared to control. To elucidate
the nature of activity of ZnO NPs, growth curves have been measured
for ZnO-treated (0.5 mg/mL) S. aureus and E. coli bacterial strains till
48 h (Figure S11). No growth of bacterial
cells up to 48 h revealed the bactericidal activity of ZnO NPs. The
colloidal suspension of ZnO NPs and PEGylated ZnO NPs in PD fluid
exhibited reduced inhibitory effect against both the S. aureus and E. coli, as shown in Figure 6A,B, respectively. Although for S. aureus, the inhibition of NP suspensions in the PD fluid was similar to
that in water up to 2 h and decreases with further increase in time,
a significant decrease in the inhibition mainly for PEGylated ZnO
NPs was seen for E. coli from the starting
time point.

ZnO NPs, PEG-6000-coated ZnO NPs, PEG-200-coated ZnO NPs, ZnO NPs

in the PD fluid, each having the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.

The increase in the multidrug resistance of many
well-known antibiotics
against various bacterial strains poses a major challenge for the
treatment of infectious diseases, resulting in severe morbidity and
mortality of such patients. Antimicrobial NPs are a promising substitute
to antibiotics having the potential to combat the infectious diseases.30 However, the prompt interaction of NPs with
peptides, proteins, and lipids in biological media leading to the
formation of PC on their surface strongly impact the biodistribution,
clearance, activity, and toxicity of such NPs.31 Further, the adsorption and interaction of proteins onto
the surface of such NPs have been reported to induce the structural
and/or conformational changes of such proteins.32,33 As reported previously by our group, PD fluid being a complex mixture
similar to biological fluids also exhibits the ability to interact
with ZnO NPs, rendering the NPs with a completely new biological identity.18 Another important aspect required to be investigated
is the effect of such interactions on the antibacterial activities
of ZnO NPs, which will further enlighten the use of such NPs in PD-related
infections. Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of the formed biological
entity of ZnO NPs in PD fluid has been studied in the present work.
Further, it was proposed that the surface coating of ZnO NPs may inhibit
the interaction of PD components with NPs. Therefore, the surface
coating of ZnO NPs with PEG polymers has been carried out in the present
study, followed by the investigation of physicochemical properties
of obtained PEGylated ZnO NPs when dispersed in the PD fluid.

Although the XRD and TEM data demonstrate the colloidal stability
of PEG-capped ZnO NPs in the PD fluid, UV–vis, FT-IR, and NMR
results reveal some sort of interaction of PEGylated ZnO NPs with
PD constituents. In contrast to the PD fluid, we have seen a clear
agglomeration of PEGylated ZnO NPs in lactic acid and citric acid
when dispersed separately in these organic acids, as revealed from
the TEM images. It seems that the interaction of ZnO NPs with the
constituents of PD fluid, lactate ions, and citrate ions in lactic
acid and citric acid still occurs despite the PEGylation of NPs. Adsorption
of biomolecules and plasma proteins onto the surface of PEG-functionalized
poly-(methoxypolyethyleneglycol cyanoacrylate-co-hexadecylcyanoacrylate)
(PHDCA) NPs have also been reported by Kim et al.,34 and the authors suggested that despite the reduction in
the binding of biomolecules on PEGylated NPs surface, some interaction
could still take place.

Further, we found that all the three
types of NPs, that is, ZnO
NPs, PEG-6000@ZnO NPs, and PEG-200@ZnO NPs, are proficient against S. aureus and E. coli bacteria. However, we found that the inhibition rate of ZnO NPs
were decreased when dispersed in PD fluid, supporting the fact that
ZnO NPs form a completely different biological entity in PD fluid
with different antimicrobial properties. Strikingly, a significant
decrease in the inhibition rate of PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in
the PD fluid has also been observed when compared to PEGylated ZnO
NPs dispersed in water. To our surprise, the inhibition rate of surface-coated
ZnO NPs dispersed in PD fluid was even less than that of bare ZnO
NPs dispersed in PD fluid. Although the exact mechanism of inactivation
of bacteria by ZnO NPs is not completely known, a plausible action
involves the interaction of ZnO NPs with cell surfaces which leads
to membrane damage, followed by cellular internalization of NPs and
induction of oxidative stress in bacterial cells because of the generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing cell growth inhibition and
eventually cell death.7,35−37 The surface
modification of ZnO NPs has been reported to affect the mechanisms
of toxicity such as the interactions of NPs with bacterial membrane,
dissolution of ZnO to Zn2+ ions, and the production of
ROS, resulting in different cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, when compared
to its bare counterpart.38−41 The antimicrobial activities of many NPs have been
reported to diminish in blood serum because of the interaction of
NPs with serum proteins.42−44 For instance, Divya et al. have
shown that the silver (Ag) NPs lost their antibacterial properties
against the bacteria grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth because of
their interaction with serum proteins present in the medium.42 Therefore, the observed reduction of the antibacterial
activities of bare and PEGylated ZnO NPs in PD fluid in the present
study could be attributed to the surface modification of NPs with
PD constituents, resulting in the suppression of direct interaction
of NPs with the cell surfaces and thus the decrease in dissolution
to Zn2+ ions and/or the release of ROS. It is seen that
even PEG capping of ZnO NPs does not retain their antimicrobial activities
in PD fluid. Few studies have shown that although the PEGylation of
NPs typically reduce the nonspecific interactions of NPs with serum
proteins when compared to their non-PEGylated counterparts; however,
it does not completely rule out the possibility of the interaction
of serum proteins with the underlying reactive surfaces.25 Similarly, the PEG coating of ZnO NPs may not
completely prevent the interaction of PD constituents with ZnO NPs,
and thus affect their antibacterial activities.

Although we
have seen a reduction in the antibacterial activities
of ZnO NPs when dispersed in peritoneal dialysate when compared to
ZnO suspension in water, the antibacterial effect is not completely
diminished despite the complex nature of the PD fluid. The potential
of these NPs in combination with low-dose antibiotics can further
be evaluated for PD-related infections which may help combat the growing
resistance against currently used antibiotics. Also, the development
of stable and robust noble NP-based formulations are required, which
could be highly effective against the bacterial strains and hence
can be used for the treatment of infectious peritonitis.

Conclusions
In the present study, we have investigated the physicochemical
and antibacterial properties of PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in PD
fluid using various experimental techniques. XRD and TEM results revealed
the colloidal stability of both the PEG-6000- and PEG-200-capped ZnO
NPs in PD fluid in contrast to bare ZnO NPs, indicating a substantial
role of PEG in acquiring the stability in the PD fluid. UV–vis,
FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopy demonstrated the interaction of PEGylated
ZnO NPs with PD constituents which infers that surface coating with
PEG does not completely rule out the possibility of binding and/or
interaction of PD components with ZnO NPs. Similar interaction of
PEGylated ZnO NPs with lactic and citric acid was also revealed, leading
to the agglomeration of NPs, as observed through TEM images. Further,
the antibacterial properties of bare and PEG-coated ZnO NPs dispersion
in the PD fluid were investigated. It has been demonstrated that although
both the bare and PEGylated ZnO NPs exhibit excellent antibacterial
properties against the S. aureus and E. coli bacterial strains, their efficacy gets reduced
when dispersed in the PD fluid. All of these results suggest that
PEG surface coating of ZnO NPs was unable to prevent the interaction
of PD constituents with NPs, and their antibacterial activities get
reduced when dispersed in PD fluid, although not completely diminished.
The synergistic effect of antibiotics in combination with ZnO NPs
can be investigated in future because it may help combat the growing
resistance of PD infections against antibiotics.

and deuterium oxide (D2O) used in NMR spectroscopy were
procured from Sigma-Aldrich (Rhode Island, USA). The deionized water
was used throughout the experiments (obtained from Millipore system
equipped with Milli-Q Gradient Century and Elix Century systems).
Gram-positive S. aureus (MTCC-3160)
and Gram-negative E. coli (DH5-Alpha)
strains were used in antibacterial assessment of ZnO NPs. LB media
purchased from Himedia (REF M575-500G) was used for the bacterial
strain growth.

PEGylation of Zinc Oxide NPs
The
surface capping of
ZnO NPs with PEG was carried out, as reported previously by Nabiyouni
et al., with slight modifications.22 Briefly,
0.5 g of ZnO NPs was suspended in 50 cm3 of distilled water
in a round bottom flask. PEG-200 (1.6 mL) was dissolved in 90 cm3 of distilled water separately and then added to the above
suspension of ZnO NPs. The mixture was then kept for magnetic stirring
(Glassco 1500.EU.01) at room temperature for 48 h and left undisturbed
for the next 48 h (illustrated in Figure S1). The particles were collected and washed with distilled water 3–4
times. The unreacted PEG molecules were removed from the suspension
by membrane dialysis (3 kDa MWCO), followed by centrifugation (HERMLE
Labortechnik Centrifuge Z326 K). The as-obtained powder was dried
in an oven at 90 °C for 6 h and used for further studies. The
aforementioned steps were repeated for coating with PEG-6000.

Characterization
X-Ray
Diffraction
The structure and crystallinity of
all samples were determined from the powder XRD patterns obtained
at Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer (equipped with a Cu Kα1 source at 40 kV and 30 mA). The samples were placed in a glass holder
and scanned from 10° to 90° with a scanning rate of 2.0°/min.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
The morphological
characterization of PEGylated ZnO NPs and its dispersion in PD fluid,
citric acid, lactic acid, and glucose were carried out by Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI Netherlands)
with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples for TEM analysis
were prepared by depositing two to three droplets of dilute solution
of the NPs onto a carbon-coated copper grid (Icon Analytical Equipment
Pvt. Ltd).

FT-IR Spectroscopy
All samples were
characterized by
an Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (PerkinElmer Frontier
Instruments). FT-IR was performed on pressed pellets made of KBr and
dried sample powder. The FT-IR spectrum was collected between 450
and 4000 cm–1.

UV–Visible Spectroscopy
UV–visible absorption
spectra were acquired between the wavelength range of 200–800
nm at different time intervals using an Agilent Cary 300 (double-beam
UV–vis spectrophotometer) with a spectral bandwidth of 2 nm.
Quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length was used in this experiment.

Particle Size Distribution and Zeta Potential Measurements
Size distributions of the NPs and their zeta potential were determined
with a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Inc, UK) by using
DLS and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS).

Thermogravimetric
Analysis
TGA was carried out using
a TG analyzer (EXSTAR TG/DTA 6300) by heating the samples under nitrogen
flow (200 mL/min). Approximately, 10 mg of the NPs was placed in an
alumina crucible on the pan of the microbalance and heated from room
temperature to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, using Al2O3 powder as a reference material.

NMR Spectroscopy
1D 1H NMR spectra were
acquired on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped
with Smart BBFO probe with z-axis gradient at 298 K using CPMG (Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill)
pulse sequence (cpmgpr1d, standard Bruker pulse program) with the
presaturation of water. NMR tubes (5 mm) (Wilmad Glass, USA) filled
with 400 μL of the samples were used to carry out the NMR spectroscopy.
A sealed capillary tube carrying 0.1 mM TSP (sodium salt of 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,
2, 3, 3-d4)-propionic acid) in D2O was inserted
inside NMR tubes for the purpose of chemical-shift referencing. The
following parameters were used for 1D CPMG pulse sequence: spectral
sweep width: 20 ppm; data points: 64 K; flip angle of radio-frequency
pulse: 90°; total relaxation delay: 5 s; number of scans: 32;
window function: exponential; and line broadening: 0.3 Hz. Topspin-2.1
(Bruker NMR data Processing Software) was used to process all of the
spectra using standard FT procedure, followed by manual-phase and
baseline correction. Chemical shifts were referenced to TSP methyl
protons at 0.0 ppm (part per million).

Antimicrobial Study
Antimicrobial activity of ZnO NPs
and PEGylated ZnO NPs was examined using growth inhibition studies
against the Gram-positive S. aureus (MTCC-3160) and Gram-negative E. coli (DH5-Alpha) bacterial strains. All of the materials were freshly
prepared and sterilized using an autoclave. To perform the antimicrobial
experiments, the S. aureus and E. Coli strains were grown aerobically at 37 °C
in 10 mL of LB medium in 18 mm × 150 mm borosilicate glass culture
tubes (BOROSIL) with continuous shaking at 220 rpm under normal laboratory
conditions. The optical density (OD) of culture at 600 nm wavelength
was considered as cell growth measure, which was recorded using an
Agilent Cary 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Briefly, the bacterial
culture was grown in 10 mL of freshly prepared and autoclaved LB media
up to ∼0.6 OD at 600 nm wavelength. After that, this culture
was used as a seed for 1 L of LB media. The culture was incubated
under the same laboratory condition (as mentioned above) until OD
reached again to 0.6. This bacterial culture was then aliquoted (5
mL each) in different culture tubes. The antimicrobial test was performed
on these bacterial culture aliquots treated with 0.5 and 1 mg/mL of
bare ZnO NPs and PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed in water. The inhibition
of bacterial growth was monitored every 2 h under UV–vis spectrophotometer
by measuring the respective change in OD for three replicates. A similar
study was carried out for both the ZnO and PEGylated ZnO NPs dispersed
in the PD fluid.
