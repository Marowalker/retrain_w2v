Nonoxidative
dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate over
a CuMgO-based catalyst was investigated. Although the active site
is metallic copper (Cu0), the best reaction conditions
were obtained by tuning the ratio of Cu/Mg and doping the catalyst
with 1 wt % of Pd to achieve a very specific activity for methyl formate
synthesis. On the basis of the CO2 temperature-programmed
desorption study, the basic strength of the catalyst plays a role
in the efficient conversion of methanol to methyl formate via dehydrogenation.
These CuMgO-based catalysts show excellent thermal stability during
the reaction and the regeneration processes. Approx. 80% methanol
conversion with constant selectivity to methyl formate was achieved
even after 4 rounds of usage for a total reaction time exceeding 200
h, indicative of their potential for practical applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Methyl formate (MF) is an essential reactive
intermediate in C1
chemistry.1−3 It is widely used for the synthesis of numerous value-added
products in the chemical industry, including ethylene glycol, N,N-dimethyl formamide, methyl glycolate,
acetic acid, methyl propionate, and formaide. MF is also a highly
valuable chemical that can directly be used as an antiseptic, solvent,
and gasoline additive.4 Several modes of
synthesis of MF have been reported in the literature. They involve
the selective oxidation of methanol,3 dehydrogenation
of methanol,3 hydrogenation of CO2 to MF,5 dimerization of formaldehyde,6 carbonylation of methanol,7 and esterification of methanol with formic acid,8 with the first two synthetic routes being the
most popular for the commercial production. In comparison to the selective
oxidation reaction, the nonoxidative dehydrogenation reaction not
only avoids the addition of an oxidant, meaning that it is not only
a safer reaction to lower the production costs, but it also produces
hydrogen as a value-added byproduct that can be used as a fuel or
reducing agent in various industries.

The direct dehydrogenation
reaction of methanol to produce MF is
described in details in Scheme 1. Although several homogeneous systems have been developed
for dehydrogenative homocoupling of primary alcohols to the corresponding
esters,9−16 the formyl group of MF from methanol tends to undergo further dehydrogenation
reactions.17,18 On the other hand, for heterogeneous
systems, the products obtained through dehydrogenation of methanol
can be diverse, and many factors can influence the catalytic performance.19−21 For example, an acidic support leads to the increases in dehydration
processes (e.g. dimethyl ether),22 and
higher temperatures favor gaseous products such as CO or CO2.23 It has been demonstrated that copper
was the active species for MF syntheses24−29 and previous studies30−33 also showed that metallic copper was the major active species for
the methanol dehydrogenation reaction. Besides copper, there are other
materials that can act as catalysts for this reaction, including palladium,
nickel, and platinum.34 However, despite
the high number of studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of
methanol to form MF, the formation rates of MF obtained so far are
not sufficiently high for practical use, and a catalyst with a practically
long lifetime still needs to be discovered.

Scheme 1 Dehydrogenation of
Methanol
Herein, we report
that the formation rate of the MF can be enhanced
by the addition of a basic material (MgO) and the catalytic performance
can be improved by tuning the ratio of Cu/MgO. Compared to the traditional
impregnated copper-based catalysts,4 the
CuMgO-based catalysts show a significant improvement of methanol conversion
(11.7–16.7%) and MF selectivity (62.5–88.1%). Furthermore,
the incorporation of Pd to CuMgO was found to prevent the deactivation
and increase the stability of the catalyst for methanol dehydrogenation.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Catalysts
Texture
properties (Table 1) of the catalysts
show that they all have similar Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas (50.1–62.4 m2/g) and pore volumes
(0.54–0.60 cm3/g), except the highest copper-containing
catalyst (Cu7MgO3) which has a larger pore size.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm plot shows
that the adsorption amount increased slowly with increasing pressure
during the initial stage, and after the pressure reached the saturated
vapor pressure, the adsorption amount increased rapidly. These pores
were all provided by the crystal stacking (type III, nonporous material).
These results allow one to conclude that Cu7MgO3 produces the largest particles, resulting in a larger pore size.
These large particles might be a result of copper aggregation, triggered
by the higher copper loading. After the addition of palladium, the
BET surface area and pore volume both decreased, because of the presence
of the palladium heteroatom, as shown in 1Pd/Cu3MgO7 and 1Pd/Cu5MgO5.

To better understand the effects
of Pd and the Cu/MgO ratio, several
techniques were employed to characterize the properties of the catalysts.
In Figure 1a, the wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that the intensity of CuO peaks
(35.6°, 38.8°, JCPDS card no. 01-073-6023) increased with
increasing copper loading, whereas the peaks of MgO (36.8°, 42.7°,
61.9°, JCPDS card no. 1-071-1176) decreased. The spent catalysts
all showed Cu (43.2°, 50.3°, JCPDS cards no. 00-004-0836)
and MgO peaks but without those of CuO or Cu2O (Figure 1b). These results
indicate that the metallic state of copper species (Cu0) can be maintained after the dehydrogenation reaction and the catalysts
were not oxidized during the catalytic test. The particle sizes of
metallic copper increased with increasing copper loading because of
the aggregation of copper species. Moreover, the addition of Pd likely
inhibits the growth of copper crystal,35 as the Pd-containing catalyst shows smaller particle sizes than
those of catalysts without Pd.

Figure 1 XRD patterns for: (a) fresh catalysts
and (b) spent catalysts after
the catalytic test for 20 h.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 2) show the significant differences
in morphology between the high copper-containing and low copper-containing
catalysts. The low copper-containing catalysts (Figure 2a,c,e,g) show a homogeneous mixture of copper
nanoclusters and MgO with only small copper particles distributed
on the MgO flakes. For the high copper-containing catalysts (Figure 2i), the small copper
nanoparticles become larger copper cluster, consistent with the results
from the XRD analysis. Moreover, the study of spent catalysts revealed
that the catalysts with palladium (Figure 2d,g) showed less amorphous carbon coking
layer compared to those without palladium doping (Figure 2b,f) after the catalytic test.
These observations suggest that the addition of palladium may inhibit
the coke formation.

1Pd/Cu5MgO5-fresh; (h) 1Pd/Cu5MgO5-spent; (i) Cu7MgO3-fresh; and (j) Cu7MgO3-spent.

Although XRD patterns and TEM images provide useful information
about the catalysts’ surfaces, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurement can offer more details about the high copper-containing
catalysts, particularly Cu7MgO3. The Cu-LMM
spectrum (Figure 3)
shows a shoulder at approx. 572.2 eV, indicating that the Cu7MgO3 catalyst has a more complexed structure with larger
copper clusters compared to others,36,37 further confirming
the results in the XRD and TEM studies.

Figure 3 Cu-LMM XPS study of catalysts.

Additionally, the H2-temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR) measurement (Figure 4) shows that the low copper-containing catalysts (Cu1MgO9 and Cu2MgO8) possess no reactivity
in the reduction reaction. The amount of H2 consumption
increased with the increasing copper loading, but the reduction temperature
almost stayed the same (250 °C); these findings suggest that
our preparation processes using the coprecipitation method can successfully
enhance the amount of surface copper, and all the copper-based catalysts
have similar reduction sites with different amounts of H2 consumption (Table 1). The H2-TPR measurement also reveals the effects of
the addition of palladium. The reduction peak slightly shifted to
higher temperatures to approx. 350 °C, presumably because of
the interaction of the small palladium particles with hydrogen, which
enhances the reduction ability of the copper oxide through the dissociation
of H2 on palladium followed by the spillover on the copper
oxide phase.38

Figure 4 H2-TPR study
of catalysts.

In the CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) study,
the strength of basic sites was found to increase with the magnesium
content (Figure 5).
The high copper-containing (low magnesium) catalysts only showed a
weak basic site (100–150 °C), and the Cu7MgO3-CP catalyst showed almost no basic sites. Both Cu1MgO9-CP and Cu2MgO8-CP, however,
afforded medium-strong basic sites. The addition of palladium heteroatoms
can reduce the amount of medium-strong basic sites as well as the
total amount of basic sites (Table 1), and these findings are directly correlated to the
activity of the catalysts in the methanol dehydrogenation reaction.

Figure 5 CO2-TPD study of catalysts.

Activity Test
In the catalyst screening, the dramatic
influence of the Cu/MgO ratio on the catalytic performance was observed. Table 2 and Figure 6a show that a specific ratio
of Cu/MgO is necessary for a methanol dehydrogenation to occur. Although
a higher copper ratio can improve the conversion, the excess amount
of copper harms the catalytic performance, presumably because of the
fact that the high copper concentration may lead to bigger copper
clusters, whereas lower copper loading favors the formation of smaller
copper nanoparticles. Higher copper-containing catalysts, such as
Cu5MgO5 and Cu7MgO3 also
displayed a higher CO selectivity compared to those of the low copper-containing
catalysts. According to the recent work by Yang et al.,39 the higher amount of COx byproduct could be a result from the C–H and C–O
bond cleavage mechanism, which is mostly related to the presence of
larger copper clusters in high copper-containing catalysts (entries
5–7). The conversion decreased as the reaction time increased,
and this deactivation is likely related to the coke formation. The
coke species may hinder the active sites, leading to the decrease
of conversion. Nevertheless, the selectivity for MF formation remains
high. As the copper loading increased, the lifetime became longer
but only up to the Cu/MgO ratio of 1. The catalyst lifetime then decreased
for those of Cu/MgO ratios higher than 1 (Figure 6b). Again, these observations suggest that
the larger copper clusters were formed in the high copper loading
rather than copper nanoparticles, thus offering less active sites.
In addition to the copper effect, an insufficient MgO content provides
almost no basic sites (CO2-TPD, Figure 5), and resulted in the decrease of the catalytic
performance. Excess MgO, which offers more medium-strong basic sites,
also harms the catalytic performance because the stronger basic sites
can facilitate other side reactions such as polymerisations40 and formation of polycyclic aromatics.41 These side reactions may form more coke and
deactivate the catalyst faster.

a Reaction condition: T = 250 °C, carrier gas flow (N2) = 50 mL/min,
feedstock
(liquid methanol) = 0.1 mL/min, catalyst = 100 mg, WHSVMeOH = 47.4 h–1, 30 h.

The addition of palladium can improve the performance
and stability
of the catalyst because palladium inhibits the medium-strong basic
sites (Figure 5) and
extends the lifetime of the catalyst. The excessed medium-strong basic
sites in high MgO-containing catalysts promote more side reactions
to form the coke to deactivate the catalyst. Moreover, the addition
of palladium also decreased the reduction ability of the catalyst
to lower the selectivity toward gaseous products (such as CO and CO2) and to enhance MF selectivity (Table 2, entries 3–6). As shown in Figure 7, the low copper-containing
catalysts (Cu3MgO7 and 1Pd/Cu3MgO7) showed significant differences in the catalytic activity
(methanol conversion = 6.1 and 15.0%), and Cu5MgO5 and 1Pd/Cu5MgO5 catalysts provided a similar
methanol conversion (16.7 and 14.9%) and MF selectivity (88.1 and
93.3%). The long-term test showed that 1Pd/Cu5MgO5 can maintain 80% of the original activity over the course of reaction
time of 100 h (Figure 8, 79.2% of methanol conversion and 80.0% MF formation rate), whereas
the activity of the Cu5MgO5 catalyst was dropped
by approx. 40% (56.9% of methanol conversion and 57.5% of MF formation
rate).

Reuse Test
Results of the reuse test on the Cu5MgO5 catalyst indicated that after 4-round usage,
the catalyst still maintained 80.1% of activity in the MF formation
rate (Figure 9). The
activity test after the second round led to the similar results (MF
formation rate = 9.9, 9.6, and 9.7 gMF/gcat.·h); however, the performance was slightly lower than those
obtained for the first round, suggesting that a few active sites might
be poisoned after the first round and cannot be regenerated effectively.
The weight loss of the spent catalyst (Figure 10) suggests that some of the coke cannot
be removed under 600 °C and this unremovable hard coke might
cause the deactivation of the regenerated catalysts.

reaction. Reaction conditions: T = 250 °C, carrier
gas flow (N2) = 50 mL/min,

Conclusions
Our study reveals that an optimized value
of the Cu/MgO ratio is
essential to facilitate the methanol dehydrogenation reaction. The
excessive copper loading forms larger copper clusters rather than
copper nanoparticles, which lower the MF selectivity. On the other
hand, the excess MgO leads to the increase of coke formation because
of the higher medium-strong basic sites. These two effects both harm
the catalytic performance (i.e. methanol conversion and lifetime of
the catalyst). The Cu/MgO ratio of 1 provides the best catalytic performance.
In addition, Pd also plays a critical role to prolong the lifetime
of the catalyst by decreasing the amount of medium-strong basic sites.
The addition of Pd not only modifies the catalyst’s basic property
with a smaller amount of medium-strong basic sites but also enhance
the reduction ability of copper oxide to improve the catalytic activity
and stability. The reuse test demonstrated that the Cu5MgO5 catalyst can be efficiently regenerated and reused
for at least 4 rounds. After the regeneration process (through calcination),
at least 80% methanol conversion and constant MF selectivity can be
achieved, suggesting a great potential for practical applications
in a low-cost process for the MF production.

Experimental Section
Catalyst
Preparation
CuMgO catalysts were prepared
by the coprecipitation method. Certain amounts (Cu/MgO weight ratio
= 1:9, 2:8, 3:7, 1:1, 7:3) of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) were dissolved
in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water, and a 0.6 M K2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) solution was then added dropwise
under vigorous stirring at 70 °C for 3 h. The blue solid coprecipitates
were filtered and washed with DI water and then dried overnight at
90 °C and finally calcined at 400 °C for 3 h (these catalysts
were labeled as CuxMgOy, where the x/y is the weight
ratio of Cu/MgO).

Pd-containing catalysts were prepared by the
incipient wetness impregnation method. CuMgO catalysts were impregnated
with a given amount (1 wt % of Pd to CuMgO) of Pd(NO3)2·2H2O (Aldrich, ∼40% Pd basis) precursor
in an aqueous solution at 60 °C, and stirred for 3 h. After impregnation,
the samples were dried at 90 °C overnight and then calcined at
300 °C for 4 h.

Characterization
CO2-TPD
and H2-TPR were performed using the apparatus Altamira
AMI 200 Ip (Altamira
Instruments, Inc.) and detected by a Hiden HPR 20 mass spectrometer
(Hiden Analytical, Inc.), 30 mg of each catalyst was used for measurement.
CO2-TPD samples were pretreated 120 min at 250 °C
under argon (50 mL/min) and then treated in a flux of 1% of CO2 in helium (25 mL/min) for 60 min at room temperature, followed
by helium flush for 1 h at 50 °C. The temperature of the calorimeter
furnace was then programmed with a heating rate of 10 °C/min
and at a helium flow rate of 50 mL/min. Samples of H2-TPR were pretreated
120 min at 250 °C under argon (50 mL/min), and then cooled to
room temperature for 60 min. Once the catalysts were stabilized, they
underwent a reduction process in the calorimeter furnace with a heating
rate of 10 °C/min and at 5% H2 in Ar at 30 mL/min.

Samples were imaged using Titan CT (FEI Company) operating at 300
kV and equipped with a 4k × 4k charge-coupled device camera (Gatan
Inc., Pleasanton, CA). They were placed on a 300 mesh copper grid
precoated with a holey amorphous carbon film.

XRD spectra of
the catalysts were obtained using D8 ADVANCE XRD
(Bruker) at 40 kV and 40 mA, with Cu Kα (1.54184 Å) as
the X-ray source. Diffraction patterns were recorded between 10°
and 70° (2θ), by incremental steps of 0.02, at 10°/min.

Texture properties (e.g., specific surface areas, pore size, and
pore volume) of the catalysts were determined using the single-point
BET method, by adsorption of N2 at its liquid temperature
and subsequent desorption at room temperature. The ASAP 2420 apparatus
(Micromeritics) was used in the experiments. Samples were degassed
at 673 K for 10 h, prior to analysis.

XPS experiments were performed
using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD instrument
equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operated at a power of 150 W and under ultrahigh
vacuum conditions in the range of ∼10–9 mbar. All spectra
were recorded in the hybrid mode using electrostatic and magnetic
lenses and an aperture slot of 300 μm × 700 μm. The
survey and high-resolution spectra were acquired at fixed analyzer
pass energies of 160 and 20 eV, respectively. The samples were mounted
in the floating mode in order to avoid differential charging. Therefore,
XPS spectra were acquired using charge neutralization.

The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler
Toledo TGA/differential scanning calorimetry instrument equipped with
a GC 200 Gas Controller and an auto-sampler. The sample was first
subjected to an isothermal treatment of 150 °C for 30 min, and
under flowing N2 (99.9999% purity) with a flow rate of
50 mL/min. It was subsequently heated to 1000 °C (10 °C/min).

Catalytic Reaction
The methanol dehydrogenation reaction
was carried out with a fixed-bed reactor. Prior to the reaction, 100
mg of catalyst was placed in the reactor and reduced by dilute hydrogen
(H2/N2 = 30 mL/min:20 mL/min) at 250 °C
for 3 h. After pretreatment, a stream of pure methanol solution was
first fed (0.1 mL/min) into an evaporator at 200 °C, and then
the methanol vapor was carried into the reactor by N2 (50
mL/min). Reaction products were analyzed using an online GC system
(Varian GC-450) connected with two channels, A and B. Channel A is
consisted of a set of three packed columns, “HayeSep”
Q (CP81073),“HayeSep” T (CP81072), and “MolSieve”
13X (CP81073), connected with a TCD detector to monitor CO and CO2. Channel B uses a CP-wax 52CB column (CP7668) and was connected
with a flame ionization detector to monitor MF and other oxygenates.
After a reaction time of 50 h, the spent catalyst was regenerated
by calcination for 3 h at 400 °C, under an air atmosphere, to
remove the coking. Once regenerated, the catalyst was reduced by dilute
H2 before undergoing the next round of the catalytic test
as previously described.
