Investigation on
the formation mechanism of the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
electrode for electrochemical water splitting
application was attempted with the use of the hydrothermal processing
technique. Formation of single-phase β-NiS, Ni(OH)2 and composite-phase β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 has been thoroughly
analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) spectra. Three different kinds
of morphologies such as rock-like agglomerated nanoparticles, uniformly
stacked nanogills, and uniform nanoplates for β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 materials, respectively,
were confirmed by SEM images. The characteristic vibration modes of
β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites were confirmed from Raman and Fourier transform infrared
spectra. Near band edge emission and intrinsic vacancies present in
the nanocomposites were retrieved by photoluminescence spectra. The
optical band gaps of the synthesized nanocomposites were calculated
as 2.1, 2.5, and 2.2 eV for β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 products, respectively. The high-performance electrochemical
water splitting was achieved for the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite as 240 mA/g at 10 mV/s from a linear sweep voltammogram
study. The faster charge mobile mechanism of the same electrode was
confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra and a Tafel slope value
of 53 mV/dec. The 18 h of stability was achieved with 95% retention,
which was also reported for the NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
for continuous electrochemical water splitting applications.

1 Introduction
For sustainable energy
production, the electrochemical water splitting
approach played a vital role for the past few years of energy research.1 This approach produces clean energy by two half-reactions,
namely, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
(OER), thereby reducing the usage of fossil fuels merely for energy.2 The electrochemical water splitting approach
generally converts the abundant electrical energy into HER and OER
by electrolyzing the water electrolyte.3,4 It is a big
challenge to discover earth-abundant, low-cost candidates for the
entire energy-related applications. Therefore, there are innumerable
transition metal oxides, sulfides, selenides, and phosphates, and
their composites are attempted by researchers. Among them, Ni-based
derivatives are highly recommendable for energy-related applications
such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and electrochemical
sensors.5−7 There are a variety of Ni derivatives being processed
by researchers in which nickel sulfide is a multifunctional and demandable
nanomaterial for various industrial sectors.8 Further, hydroxide-based transition metals received recent attention
of the research community due to their robust electrochemical stability
and also the easy access of the electrochemical pathway to separate
hydrogen and oxygen through redox reactions. Among other hydroxide
nanomaterials, nickel hydroxide is one of the best efficient nanomaterials
for potential application and is believed to enhance the overall electrochemical
kinetics of the electrode under an electrode/electrolyte interface.9 Further, property wise, we can easily tune the
structure, morphology, and physicochemical properties, which will
definitely satisfy the requirements such as high theoretical capacitance
and high electrochemical stability in an alkaline medium over a long
duration of electrochemical energy production and storage applications.10 With this, suitable strategies are also available
to boost the material’s electrochemical performance such as
combinational linkages of different kinds of nanostructures and diverse
morphology achievement.11 A more number
of current collectors are used by researchers for potential applications
such as nickel foam, graphite sheet, titanium plate, and aluminum
foil. Usually, nickel foam has been adapted as an efficient collector
for such applications, and also, there was almost zero adhesion problem
found in the nickel foam substrate for long-time electrochemical reaction
conditions.12 The major advantages of choosing
the hydrothermal route in our present work to synthesize the nanocomposites
are as follows: (a) Generally, the hydrothermal route is an efficient
and user-friendly route to produce a diverse morphology of nanostructures
with good quality. (b) We have optimized the temperature and constant
pressure conditions to obtain the desired nanoplate morphology of
synthesized β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites via a one-step
hydrothermal route. (c) Usually, NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites
were synthesized by adapting a two-step hydrothermal route; nevertheless,
we tuned the hydrothermal parameters and optimized the growth condition
to obtain NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite particle growth toward
getting nanoplate morphology for electrochemical water splitting applications.
(d) A number of active sites and conductivity of the nanocomposites
for electrochemical water splitting applications highly depend on
the material morphology. Hence, in order to achieve uniform nanoplate
morphology of the synthesized nanocomposites, we have followed the
hydrothermal route.

Many of the research activities have been
explored for nickel-based
materials for potential applications.13−15 Recently, Zhang and
his co-workers controlled the synthesis method to produce diverse
morphological transition hydroxide nanomaterials for hybrid supercapacitor
applications.13 Lee and his team investigated
a detailed analysis on the phase change mechanism and conversion of
nickel sulfide to the hydroxide phase in an electrochemical water
oxidation reaction.13 Liang and his group
revealed the enhancement of specific capacitance of Ni hydroxide nanostructure
by morphology tailoring.14 From these attempts,
due to the versatile role of Ni sulfide and Ni hydroxide nanostructures,
in the present study, we have been focused to synthesize β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrocatalysts for electrochemical water
splitting applications. The novelty of the present work is exclusively
focused on the synergistic effect of the number of the oxidative species
availability at the interface due to the composite nature of the electrode
by addressing the material morphology and composite nature of NiS
and Ni(OH)2 in the aspect of improving electrochemical
stability and conductivity and has been fully explored from this work
systematically. The compact nanoplate morphology of the nanocomposites
and the combined effect of NiS and Ni(OH)2 at the interface
have been preferred to stimulate the reaction rate and conductivity.
The combination of sulfur and hydroxyl derivatives of Ni electrocatalysts
via a one-step hydrothermal route has been fully explored, and also,
the novel electrochemical mechanism of NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites
has also been reported in the present study. Hence, good quality β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrocatalysts were synthesized and characterized
by XRD, Raman, PL, and UV studies. The diverse morphologies obtained
for β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanostructures have been revealed by SEM images. The electrochemical
performance of the fabricated β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
electrodes was systematically revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV),
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA) studies, and the enhancement of
the OER active mechanism of the electrode has also been proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
Structural optimization of β-NiS,
Ni(OH)2, and
β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite synthesis via the hydrothermal
route has been attempted in this work. The formation mechanism of
the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite consisted of three
steps of controlled growth kinetics. (a) At first, the strong chemical
reaction between the sulfur source and one-third of nickel nitrate
precursor might initiate the nucleation reaction that thereby produced
the β phase NiS nanostructures. (b) In a later reaction time,
the excess amount of nickel nitrate precursors may not interact with
the sulfur group of thiourea due to the nonstoichiometric ratio of
the precursors, which might lead to the formation of hydroxide nanostructures.
(c) At the end of the reaction, ethylene glycol might act as a linking
agent between the formed β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 nanostructures
and may favor the strong chemical coupling that resulted in the formation
of β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites for electrochemical
water splitting applications. The structures of obtained nanostructures
have been confirmed by XRD spectra as shown in Figure 1. From XRD spectra, the formation of rhombohedral
β-NiS, hexagonal Ni(OH)2, and the mixed phase of
rhombohedral and hexagonal β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites
is confirmed. Figure 1a represents the typical rhombohedral phase of β-NiS without
any additional phase formation by the concerned 2θ values of
30.3, 32.2, 35.7, 40.4, 48.8, 50.1, 52.6, 56.2, 57.3, and 59.1°
for the oriented planes of (101), (300), (021), (211), (131), (410),
(401), (321), (330), and (012), respectively. Those crystal planes
are correlated to the crystal plane of rhombohedral β-NiS of
JCPDS card number #86-2281. Figure 1b demonstrates the formation of pure-phase hexagonal
Ni(OH)2 from the diffraction peaks at 19.2, 33.1, 38.6,
52.1, 59.3, 62.9, 70.3, and 73.0° for the crystal planes (001),
(100), (002), (012), (110), (111), (103), and (201), respectively,
which are matched to the diffraction peaks of hexagonal Ni(OH)2 nanostructures of JCPDS card number #73-1520. Figure 1c clearly represents the composite-phase
formation of β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanostructures. Thus,
the stabilized optimization and suitable condition for nanocomposite
formation of Ni-based sulfide and hydroxide phases were strongly suggested
by XRD spectra, and also, no other secondary impurities were present
in the sample as well, showing very good quality of the crystalline
nature of the materials performed in this work.

(b) Ni(OH)2, and (c)
β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites.

SEM images of the synthesized nanostructures have been verified
by Figure 2 in detail. Figure 2a displays the agglomerated
rock-like nanostructures of β-NiS, which represented the rigid
surface morphology with a less dispersive nature. It may not facilitate
the smoother pathway of the electrochemical reaction due to the clumsy
nature of its surface. Figure 2b displays the stacked nanogill-like nanostructures of Ni(OH)2 consisting of highly functionalized, monodispersed nanogills
that strongly facilitate the electron transport pathway to enhance
the water oxidation reaction. Figure 2c demonstrates the surface morphology of β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites. There is a uniform nanoplate morphology of
the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite with clear compact
nanoplate edges in an approximate particle size range of 50–70
nm plates. This kind of clear edge surface morphology with compact
particle size may provide higher electron mobility and a more number
of active sites for the electrochemical reaction, which has been discussed
in electrochemical studies in detail. Hence, three different kinds
of surface morphology of β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanostructures has been confirmed by SEM images.

range.

Raman spectra of the prepared
nanocomposites have been provided
in Figure 3. The characteristic
Raman active vibrations of Ni-based sulfide and hydroxide nanostructures
have been confirmed by noticeable strong phonon vibration modes. Figure 3a clearly reveals
the characteristic peaks of rhombohedral β-NiS nanostructures
through the phonon vibration peaks around 236 and 347 cm–1. These are the characteristic vibration peaks of β-NiS. The
absence of some other Raman active vibrations may be due to the agglomeration
of nanosized particles with combined nanostructure formation, which
may affect the vibrations of the crystal lattice.16Figure 3b displays the strong characteristic vibration modes of hexagonal-phase
Ni(OH)2 nanostructures around 390, 440, and 580 cm–1 that are attributed to the characteristic vibrations
of Ni hydroxide phase nanostructures. The peak 390 cm–1 could be attributed to the Eg vibration mode of Ni–OH
lattice, and the other two peaks were assigned to the stretching vibration
mode of Ni–O nanostructures.17Figure 3c displays the composite
formation of β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 nanostructures by
the strong Ni–S and Ni–OH phonon vibrations observed
around 347, 398, and 472 cm–1. Nevertheless, there
is an intensity decrement observed for β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite nanostructures, which may be due to the in-plane defects
present in the nanocomposite.18 Hence,
the formation of Ni-based sulfide and hydroxide nanostructures and
also the presence of in-plane defects have been confirmed from Raman
active modes of vibrations.

β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites.

Different kinds of electron trapping mechanisms and the recombination
nature of β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 have been explored by
PL spectra as shown in Figure 4. The prepared Ni-based materials were excited at 360 nm wavelength
to obtain corresponding emission peaks of the samples. It is clearly
revealed from Figure 4 the four noticeable emission peaks liberated by the three kinds
of samples. Nevertheless, there is a variation in intensities found. Figure 4a shows the low intense
peak near 381 nm, which may be due to de-excitation between S (3p)
and Ni (3d) levels, and the small hump near 415 nm could be attributed
to hybridization levels of S (3s, 3p) or Ni (3d).19,20 Furthermore, the peak near yellow found at 496 nm may be caused
by oxygen vacancies present in the samples. Figure 4b shows the strong NBE emission of Ni(OH)2 that may strongly support the formation of hydroxide derivatives
of Ni that may be due to exciton recombination by an exciton–exciton
collision during excitation.21Figure 4c shows the moderate
NBE emission and also the other oxygen vacancies present in the composite
nanostructures by the peaks at 485 and 496 nm due to the charge transfer
between Ni2+ to Ni3+ of Ni-based derivatives.
From the observed results, it may be derived that, even though the
emissive nature of the samples strongly depended on excitation wavelength,
the intensity of the emission peaks revealed the information about
recombination nature and interstitial vacancies present in the samples.

Figure 5 displays
the FTIR spectra of the prepared Ni-based sulfide and hydroxide derivative
and its composite in the range of 400 to 4000 cm–1. Figure 5a displays
the typical FTIR spectra of NiS nanostructures. The band around 640
cm–1 was caused by strong Ni–S stretching
vibration mode of β-NiS.22Figure 5b displays the strong
vibration band around 498 cm–1 caused by Ni–O
stretching vibration modes.23Figure 5c displays the combined
vibration modes of Ni–S and Ni–O stretching of the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite. The other vibration bands of C–O stretching,
C–H bending, OH bending, and OH stretching appear around 1097,
1378, 1641, and 3400–3600 cm–1, respectively.24,25 Hence, FTIR spectra evidenced the formation of Ni-based sulfide
and hydroxide and its composite derivatives in this study.

The optical band gap of the prepared nanocomposites has been
analyzed
by UV–visible spectra shown in Figure 6A,B. The UV spectra of the three different
samples show three different profiles that may suggest the appreciable
band gap variations possessed by the samples. From UV data, the Tauc
plot has been drawn to calculate the band gap values of the prepared
materials. The Tauc plot follows the equation αhυ = A(hυ – Eg)n, where α, h, υ, and Eg are the coefficient
of absorption, Planck’s constant, energy of incident photon,
and optical band gap, respectively. As per Tauc plot, the estimated
band gap values of β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites are 2.1, 2.5, and 2.2 eV, respectively. The
appreciable band gap variations observed for the three prepared samples
may be due to the various morphological and particle nature of the
samples in addition to the metal sulfide and metal hydroxide band
structures. The obtained results are matched well with those in the
literature.26,27 These three band structures are
favorable to OER activity of the electrode for electrochemical water
splitting applications. Among these three, 2.2 eV was highly recommendable
for efficient oxidation of water due to its optimum gap between the
valence band and Fermi level for the electrochemical OER reaction
to proceed. Hence, UV–visible spectra and Tauc plot results
strongly provide the information about the optical properties and
band gap of the synthesized nanocomposites.

and (B) Tauc plots of β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites.

Electrochemical activities of all the three samples have
been thoroughly
investigated by an electrochemical workstation at room temperature
in a 1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte medium. The stability of the fabricated
electrodes is also reported in a strong alkaline medium. Figure 7A–C represents
the CV graphs of β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites for five different scan rates of 10, 30, 50,
80, and 100 mV/s. CV graphs evidently proved the distinctive oxidation
and reduction peaks of the pseudocapacitive nature of the electrodes.
During the electrochemical process, β-NiS may undergo some complexities
in diffusion with electrolyte ions due to its bulky surface nature,
whereas Figure 7B represents
the larger area CV curve, thereby supporting the higher storage mechanism
of Ni-based hydroxides. At the same time, the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite provided the same kind of CV curve as that
of β-NiS excluding the combination effect shown in higher current
density obtained in CV. The specific capacitances calculated for β-NiS,
Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
electrodes are 216, 230, and 428 F/g at 10 mV/s, respectively. This
result clearly evidenced that the novel combination of β-NiS
and Ni(OH)2 shows higher storage capacity barely twice
than that of individual electrode performance, which may be due to
the origin of the faradaic reaction initiated by Ni–O/Ni–O–OH
and its interaction with electrolyte OH– ions.28 This kind of nanoplate morphology further facilitated
the efficient charge separation and transportation. Moreover, there
is an appreciable peak shift observed in CV curves of NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites during
the redox couple reaction. It may be due to the different onset potentials
of the corresponding electrodes during oxidation as 0.44, 0.42, and
0.43 V, respectively, at 10 mV/s. Generally, Ni (Ni2+)
oxidized into its higher valence species (Ni3+ or Ni2+x+) around 0.4 V.29 At this juncture, the composite exhibited an onset oxidation potential
of 0.43 V, which lies in between the oxidation of NiS and Ni(OH)2 nanostructures during oxidation. Hence, it is suggested that
the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode may be
adapted as an efficient electrode for supercapacitor application,
and also, the CV result suggested that the high-performance electrode
may possess good OER activity toward electrochemical water splitting,
which has been discussed in LSV.

Ni(OH)2, and
(C) β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites and (D) EIS spectra
of all the three samples.

Figure 7D
represents
the EIS spectra of the fabricated electrodes in the frequency range
of 100 mHz to 100 kHz. This result further made the strong notation
on the CV graph. As per CV study, the highly commendable β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode illustrated higher electronic conductivity
than the other two electrodes with a very low charge transfer resistance
of 118 Ω. Further, the conducting spike region of the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite revealed the maximized conducting nature compared
to the other two electrodes. It may also suggest that the synergistic
role of β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites provided
easy interaction of electrolyte ions and electrode species. These
kinds of combinations are undoubtedly supported by a more number of
electron transportation from the working electrode that obviously
enhanced the current density. Hence, the expected β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode performed well in OER during the
electrochemical water splitting reaction.

LSV graphs explored
the OER activity of the fabricated electrodes
at a 10 mV/s scan rate as shown in Figure 8A. The maximum current densities achieved
for β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 electrodes are 132, 204, and 240 mA/g, respectively. Interestingly,
as an individual performance, both β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 possessed low current densities, but the combination of the same
two phases performed higher OER activity.30 It strongly suggested that the individual phase of β-NiS and
Ni(OH)2 involved in the electrolysis reaction via the following
electrochemical mechanism: NiS + H2O + 1/2 O2 → Ni(OH)2 + S; Ni(OH)2 + OH– → NiOOH + H2O + e–1. During
the synergistic role of both the sulfide and hydroxide derivatives
of the Ni electrode, there is a more possibility of the OER reaction
to proceed by reaction species.31 Further,
morphology played a very important role in electrochemical performance
of the fabricated electrodes. In the case of the β-NiS electrode,
the clumsy agglomerated morphology evidenced from SEM images definitely
minimized the active sites on the electrode surface, which failed
to provide more successful interactions with electrolyte ions. In
the case of the Ni(OH)2 electrode, stacked nanogills comparatively
provided a more electron ease pathway for the entire electrochemical
reaction. The combined β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
electrode possessed nanoplate-like distinguished morphology that made
an easy reaction platform for electrolyte ions and electrode active
sites. Further, the sharp, clear edges of nanoplates on the electrode
surface easily came in contact with OH– radicals
of the electrolyte resulting in a rapid and sustained oxidation reaction
of the overall electrochemical process that strongly caused for a
more number of electrons to pass over the circuit and hence exhibited
higher current density. Moreover, lower overpotential governed by
the best performed electrode was also achieved from the LSV curve.
As per CV result, LSV provided the promising evidence of the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 electrode that inherently possessed a very good OER response,
which tends to reveal the electrochemical water oxidation process.
The really good electrochemical OER activity has been achieved for
our nanocomposite when compared to the recent literature listed in Table 1.

The Tafel slope has been
drawn from LSV data of the fabricated
electrodes shown in Figure 8B. Calculated Tafel slope values of β-NiS, Ni(OH)2, and β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites are 111,
76, and 53 mV/dec, respectively. The Tafel slope directly correlated
the electron transport mechanism of fabricated electrodes. The lower
Tafel slope value dominantly resulted in higher OER performance. Hence,
the smaller Tafel slope value of 53 mV/dec possibly evidenced the
first electron rate limiting step of the electrode, which solidly
arose due to the large number of active sites participated in the
electrochemical reaction of the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
electrode.31 This may also suggest that
very good electrical coupling of β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 nanostructures may be one of the causes for higher OER activity.

Chronoamperometry stability tests for all the three electrodes
have been shown in Figure 8C for 1 h under electrochemical water oxidation at 330 mV
overpotential. In this study also, the NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
exhibited dominant performance compared to the other two electrodes.
The three samples almost retained its activity as 100% after 1 h of
stability test. The highly active NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite
electrode was further subjected to 18 h of stability test to evaluate
its long-time electrochemical OER activity. As a result of 18 h OER
activity of the electrode, it retained 95% of the electrochemical
oxygen evolution reaction in a three-cell electrochemical setup.

To evaluate the OER performance after 18 h of long-time stability
test, LSV and EIS have been run again for the NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode as shown in Figure 9A,B. LSV graphs predicted the reduction in
its performance after 18 h of stability. There was some noticeable
decay in the current density value that may be due to the continuous
electrochemical water oxidation performance of the electrode for 18
h, which may increase the surface rigidity of the electrode, which
may block the easy electron transfer evidenced by EIS spectra by the
increment in charge transfer resistance. Hence, a high-quality and
strongly coupled β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode
has been fabricated by a typical optimized procedure, and the water
splitting ability of the electrode has been explored with very high
efficiency. The synergistic effect of different phase nanocomposites,
sharp edge nanoplate morphology, and good electronic conductivity
adhered by the β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode
strongly suggested as a resourceful electrode for electrochemical
water splitting application and other potential applications such
as supercapacitors.

3 Conclusions
Efficient
combination of β-NiS and Ni(OH)2 to
obtain β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites has been a success
in this work. The formation mechanism of strongly coupled β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites has been proposed in this work. The Ni-based
sulfide and hydroxide derivative nanocomposite electrodes were fabricated
and investigated for electrochemical water splitting application.
Higher OER activity of the electrode was revealed by a higher current
density of 240 mA/g at a 10 mV/s scan rate, and also, the electrode
withstood the 18 h stability test with 95% of electrochemical performance
to adapt as a device quality electrode for electrochemical water splitting
applications.

4 Materials and Methods
For the synthesis of the β-NiS rocky texture nanostructure,
0.1 M nickel acetate (C4H6NiO4) and
0.3 M thiourea CS(NH2)2 were dissolved in 80
mL of deionized water separately. The above mixtures were mixed together
for a successful chemical reaction and then placed to a 250 mL autoclave,
which was stabilized at 180 °C for 24 h. The final product was
cleaned and dried for characterization, which was named NS1. For the
synthesis of Ni(OH)2 stacked nanogill-like nanostructures,
0.1 M nickel acetate (C4H6NiO4) and
0.3 M urea CH4N2O were dissolved in 80 mL of
deionized water separately. The same treatment time and temperature
were stabilized to obtained NS2 nanopowder. For the synthesis of β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanoplates, 0.3 M nickel acetate (C4H6NiO4) and 0.3 M thiourea (CS(NH2)2 were dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water separately, and then
they were mixed together with 5 mL of ethylene glycol added to the
mixed solution. The same treatment time and temperature were also
followed to get β-NiS@Ni(OH)2 nanoplates, named NS3.
The obtained products’ material characterization was reported
in our previous literature. The coating procedure of the active material
on Ni foam has been mentioned as follows: initially, 80% NS1 active
material, 18% activated carbon, and 2% polyvinyldone hexafluoropropylene
(PVDF) binder were ground with the help of 20 drops of n-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solution. The homogeneous slurry was then
coated on ultrasonically cleaned Ni foam with the help of a micropipette.
The active-material-coated Ni foam was then dried and used for further
electrochemical characterization. Similarly, the other two NS2 and
NS3 samples were fabricated as electrodes on Ni foam. The entire electrochemical
measurement was done in a Biologic SP 150 workstation at room temperature
in a typical three-electrode cell setup in which the working electrode
bears the active-material-coated Ni foam, counter electrode bears
platinum wire, and the reference electrode bears Ag/AgCl electrodes.
