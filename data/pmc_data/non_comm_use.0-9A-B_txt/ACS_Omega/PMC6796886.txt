The exploitation of curcumin for
oral disease treatment is limited
by its low solubility, poor bioavailability, and low stability. Surface-functionalized
poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles
(NPs) have shown promising results to ameliorate selective delivery
of drugs to the gastro-intestinal tract. In this study, curcumin-loaded
PLGA NPs (C-PLGA NPs) of about 200 nm were surface-coated with chitosan
(CS) for gastro-intestinal mucosa adhesion, wheat germ agglutinin
(WGA) for colon targeting or GE11 peptide for tumor colon targeting.
Spectrometric and zeta potential analyses confirmed the successful
functionalization of the C-PLGA NPs. Real-time label-free assessment
of the cell membrane-NP interactions and NP cell uptake were performed
by quartz crystal microbalance coupled with supported lipid bilayers
and by surface plasmon resonance coupled with living cells. The study
showed that CS-coated C-PLGA NPs interact with cells by the electrostatic
mechanism, while both WGA- and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs interact and
are taken up by cells by specific active mechanisms. In vitro cell
uptake studies corroborated the real-time label-free assessment by
yielding a curcumin cell uptake of 7.3 ± 0.3, 13.5 ± 1.0,
27.3 ± 4.9, and 26.0 ± 1.3 μg per 104 HT-29
cells for noncoated, CS-, WGA-, and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs, respectively.
Finally, preliminary in vivo studies showed that the WGA-coated C-PLGA
NPs efficiently accumulate in the colon after oral administration
to healthy Balb/c mice. In summary, the WGA- and GE11-coated C-PLGA
NPs displayed high potential for application as active targeted carriers
for anticancer drug delivery to the colon.

1 Introduction
Curcumin
is a natural product with a wide range of pharmacological
activities, including anti-inflammatory,1,2 antioxidant,3,4 and antimicrobial effects.5,6 The most attractive
property of curcumin is, however, its ability to inhibit cell proliferation
and induce apoptotic cell death of a wide variety of tumor cells.7,8 Unfortunately, the exploitation of curcumin as anticancer agent
is hampered by its low solubility and rapid decomposition in aqueous
medium, photo-instability, and poor bioavailability.

Nanoparticles
(NPs) have widely been studied as drug carriers for
anticancer drug delivery9,10 because they can protect
drugs from harsh environments and enable sustained drug release or
tumor targeting. The surface properties of NPs, namely charge, hydrophilic/lipophilic
features, and targeting agents, dictate their interaction with cells
and consequently their bioselectivity. For example, negatively charged
NPs are poorly taken up by cells compared to positively charged NPs.11,12 On the other hand, surface-coated NPs with targeting moieties have
been developed to enhance the cell selectivity and the intracellular
delivery of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window and low cell membrane
permeability.13

Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs decorated
with mucoadhesive materials, including polymers, lectins,14 and peptides,15 have
been developed for oral administration to selectively deliver drugs
to the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Chitosan (CS) coating can endow
NPs with mucoadhesive properties and enhanced transmucosal penetration.16−18 CS can also promote coulombic interactions with negatively charged
cancer cells, which translocate negatively charged constituents of
the inner layer of the cell membrane (e.g., phosphatidylserine, anionic
phospholipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans) to the cell surfaces.19

Small molecules and macromolecules have
also been exploited to
generate targeted NPs with specific mucoadhesivity or cell surface
selectivity. Lectins, the second generation mucoadhesives,20 enable site-specific targeting to mucosal cells
through noncovalent carbohydrate residue binding.21,22 For example, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a dietary lectin that
recognizes N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and sialic
acid exposed on the cell membranes of human colonocytes, colon cancer
cells, and prostate cancer cells.23 EGF
analogue peptides such as GE11,24 a peptide
devoid of bioactivity, have been used to produce drug delivery systems
that selectively target the epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressed
on tumor cells,25,26 including gastric, colorectal,
oesophageal, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer cells.27,28

The biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization
of tailored NPs is a critical step in the development of efficient
drug delivery systems. Real-time label-free in vitro analytical techniques
can provide complementary information to conventional label-based
biochemical and in vitro cell culture assays. This can improve the
cost- and time effectiveness of the development of NPs by providing
new complementary tools for selecting candidates with the biopharmaceutical
requisites for further in vivo testing, as well as for building a
better comprehension of their PK behavior.

Quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM) combined with solid supported
lipid bilayers (SLBs)29,30 and living cell sensing with
surface plasmon resonance (SPR)31−35 are two real-time label-free in vitro surface-sensitive technologies
providing rapid information on interfacial processes while obviating
the need for additional labeling processes. Although, SPR and QCM
have been used since the 1990s for biomolecular interaction studies,
they are still unexplored for research and development of pharmaceutical
nanosystems. The QCM is a mechanical measuring technique providing
nanoscale sensitivity for mass and viscoelasticity measurements by
utilizing the changes in resonant frequency and dissipation of quartz
crystal resonators upon the deposition of mass on the sensor surface.
The SPR technique, on the other hand, relies on the SPR phenomena
and measures the changes in the refractive index in the close vicinity
of SPR metal sensors upon mass deposition on the sensor surfaces.

The main objective of the present study was to investigate the
targeting of curcumin-loaded PLGA (C-PLGA) NPs to human colorectal
adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29). Accordingly, C-PLGA NPs were surface
coated with CS, WGA, and GE11 in order to improve the cell uptake
of the NPs and consequently ameliorate the delivery of curcumin to
the cells. The behavior of these three platforms was investigated
with new label-free approaches and traditional methods. Real-time
label-free QCM and SPR measurements were used to assess the cell membrane
surface interactions and targeting capability of noncoated and coated
C-PLGA NPs to HT-29 cells. Complementary physicochemical characterization
of noncoated and coated C-PLGA NPs were performed through particle
size, zeta potential, drug entrapment efficiency, and in vitro drug
release kinetics measurements. Traditional in vitro cell studies were
also performed to determine in vitro cell uptake of curcumin and cell
viability of HT-29 cells. Finally, a preliminary in vivo study with
healthy Balb/c mice was performed to evaluate the accumulation of
noncoated and targeted C-PLGA NPs in the colon after oral administration.

2.2 Preparation and Characterization
of the Formulations
2.2.1 Preparation of the Curcumin-Loaded
PLGA
NPs (C-PLGA NPs)
Noncoated curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs (C-PLGA
NPs) were prepared as described previously.37 Briefly, 176 mg of PLGA was dissolved in 5 mL of dichloromethane
(DCM) and 16.6 mg of curcumin was added to the solution. The organic
curcumin/PLGA solution was rapidly dropped into a glass tube containing
10 mL of 2% PVA in high purity water under vortexing. The mixture
was vortexed for further 10 s at a high setting and sonicated for
7 min at 40% amplitude in an ice-water bath by using a probe sonicator
(Vibra-Cell VCX 750 sonicator, Sonics & Materials Inc., Newtown,
CT, USA). The resulting fine O/W emulsion was immediately poured into
30 mL of 0.5% PVA in high purity water under rapid stirring with a
magnetic stirrer. DCM was then evaporated under magnetic stirring
at 800 rpm for 3 h and the NPs were collected by centrifugation at
48 000g for 15 min and washed 3 times with
high purity water. The supernatant was collected, desiccated under
vacuum, and the encapsulation efficiency of curcumin was evaluated
as described in Section 2.2.6.

2.2.2 Chitosan Functionalization
of C-PLGA NPs
C-PLGA NPs coated with chitosan (CS-C-PLGA
NPs) were prepared as
described above, provided that 5 mL of CS solutions (0.25, 0.50, or
1% w/v) in 1% glacial acetic acid were added to 5 mL PVA aqueous solution
prior the emulsification with the curcumin/PLGA organic solution.17

2.2.3 Preparation of Lectin
or Peptide Ligand-Coated
C-PLGA NPs
C-PLGA NPs were surface-coated with WGA lectin
or GE11 peptide according to a two-step EDC/NHS method.38,39 Briefly, 5 mL aliquots of noncoated C-PLGA NP suspensions in high
purity water were washed with 20 mL 0.1 M MES buffer, pH 5.8, and
then the noncoated C-PLGA NPs were separated by centrifugation at
15 000g. The noncoated C-PLGA NPs were incubated
with approximately 0.1 M EDC and 0.15 M NHS in 0.1 M MES buffer, pH
5.8, for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The EDC excess was quenched
by washing three times with 20 mL of 20 mM phosphate, 0.15 M (PBS),
pH 7.4. The activated C-PLGA NPs were resuspended in 5 mL PBS, pH
7.4, and added of 1 mL of 1 mg/mL WGA lectin or GE11 peptide in the
same buffer and the suspension was maintained overnight under gentle
agitation. The resulting WGA-coated NPs (WGA-C-PLGA NPs) and GE11-coated
NPs (GE11-C-PLGA NPs) were added of 1 mL of 50 mM glycine. After 1
h, the WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA NPs were separated by centrifugation,
washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and finally collected by centrifugation.

2.2.4 Determination of the Amount of Bound WGA
and GE11 to C-PLGA NPs
A water-based system comprised 2 mL
DMSO and 10 mL of 0.05 N NaOH containing 0.5% SDS was used to dissolve
the WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA NPs for determining the amount of ligands
conjugated on the C-PLGA NPs. The amount of WGA lectin or GE11 peptide
ligand in the dissolved NP solutions was quantified by colorimetric
determination of the WGA lectin/GE11 peptide content by using a μ-BCA
protein assay. The WGA lectin or GE11 peptide conjugation density
and efficiency was calculated from the following equations 1   2  

2.2.5 Physicochemical Characterization of Noncoated
and Coated C-PLGA NPs
The particle size, polydispersity index
(PDI), and zeta potential of noncoated and chitosan, WGA-, and GE11-coated
C-PLGA NPs were measured at RT by using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS instrument
(Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK) after NP dispersion
in high purity water. Morphological analyses were performed with a
JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan).

2.2.6 Encapsulation Efficiency of Curcumin in
Noncoated and Coated C-PLGA NPs
The encapsulation efficiency
of curcumin in noncoated and chitosan, WGA-and GE11-coated C-PLGA
NPs was determined by dissolving the NPs in acetonitrile and determining
the amount of curcumin by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (AcquityTM,
Waters Corp., Milford, Massachusetts, USA) at λmax = 426 nm (according to the procedure reported in the literature,40 2011), with minor changes.37 The drug encapsulation efficiency (EE %) for each NP was
calculated by using the following equation: 3  

2.2.7 In Vitro Curcumin Release from Noncoated
and Coated C-PLGA NPs
The in vitro release of curcumin from
noncoated and chitosan, WGA- and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs was determined
by the dialysis bag method reported by Zanotto-Filho et al.,41 with slight modifications. A three-stage approach
with three different pH release media was used in order to follow
the recommendations on methods for dosage form testing by US Pharmacopeia
36,42 as described earlier.37 The media and time intervals used for the three
different stages were the following: simulated gastric fluid (SGF;
0.2% NaCl, 0.2% pepsin, 0.7% hydrochloric acid, pH 1.2) between 1
and 2 h, simulated intestinal fluid (SIF; 0.68% KH2PO4, 3 mM sodium taurocholate, pH 6.8) between 3 and 5 h, and
simulated colonic fluid (SCF; PBS, pH 7.4) between 6 and 24 h. The
NP suspensions were placed into dialysis bags with a molecular cutoff
of 12–14 kDa and dialyzed in the dark against 150 mL of the
corresponding media for each time interval. Samples from the solution
in the external buffer were taken at scheduled times and analyzed
by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (AcquityTM, Waters Corp.,
Milford, Massachusetts, USA) at λmax = 426 nm, as
described earlier.37

2.2.8 In Vitro Stability of Noncoated and Coated
C-PLGA NPs
The stability of noncoated and chitosan, WGA-,
and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs in high purity water was assessed at two
different temperatures (4 °C and RT) for up to four months. Stability
of NPs in SGF, SIF, and SCF at 37 °C was assessed by incubation
of 1 mg of NPs in 1 mL of the corresponding fluids for appropriate
times for simulating GI-tract residence times. At scheduled time,
samples were taken and analyzed by ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments
Ltd, Worcestershire, UK). The experimental data were elaborated according
to the method used previously.37

2.2.9 In Vitro Mucin Adsorption to Noncoated and
Coated C-PLGA NPs
Adsorption of pig mucin (PM) on the surface
of noncoated and chitosan, WGA-, and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs was determined
by slightly modifying the method reported by Yin et al.43 Briefly, 1 mL of mucin suspension (1 mg/mL)
in PBS with pH 7.4 was stirred with 1 mL of each C-PLGA NP formulation
for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, the suspensions were centrifuged at 25 000g for 1 h. The amount of free PM in the supernatant was
determined by measuring the absorbance value at 260 nm by using a
UV spectrophotometer (UV Visible Spectrophotometer, Cary 100 Conc,
Australia). The amount of adsorbed PM was calculated by using a standard
curve measured for known amounts of PM in PBS. The calibration curve
for mucin in PBS was determined with a series of mucin standard solutions
with concentrations of 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 750, and 850 μg/mL.
The PM binding efficiency of the different C-PLGA NPs was calculated
from the following equation 4  where C0 is the
initial concentration of PM used for incubation and Cs is the concentration of free PM determined in the supernatant.

2.3 QCM Studies
2.3.1 QCM
Sensor Preparation
The silica-coated
QCM sensor crystals (Biolin Scientific, Q-Sense, Gothenburg, Sweden)
was cleaned by boiling them in a cleaning solution (water/hydrogen
peroxide/ammonium hydroxide; 5/1/1, v/v/v) for 5 min followed by rinsing
with copious amounts of ion-exchanged water and finally blow-drying
with nitrogen. Prior and after each QCM measurement, the SiO2-coated QCM sensor crystal was cleaned in situ by flushing the flow
channel with sequential 5 min injections of 20 mM CHAPS, 2% Hellmanex
II, 95% ethanol, and high purity water.

2.3.2 Preparation
of EggPC and DOPC/DOPS Cell
Model Membranes on QCM Sensors
Vesicle rupture of EggPC or
DOPC/DOPS (75/25 mol %) vesicles was used to prepare SLBs on the silica-coated
QCM sensor crystals as simple cell model membranes. Phospholipids
were dissolved separately in a defined amount in chloroform and stored
at −20 °C until used for preparation of vesicles for SLB
formation. Vesicles were prepared by evaporating the solvent from
EggPC or a mixture of DOPC/DOPS in chloroform to dryness under a stream
of nitrogen. The formed lipid films were then hydrated with a 20 mM
Hepes/150 mM NaCl buffer solution with pH 7.4 at RT by vortexing to
obtain vesicle suspensions with a total lipid content of 10 mg/mL.
The vesicle suspensions were sonicated by a tip sonicator (Vibra-Cell
VCX 750 sonicator, Sonics & Materials Inc., Newtown, CT, USA)
until clear solutions were obtained. The vesicle solutions were then
centrifuged for 1 min at 15 000g to remove
titanium particles. The particle size, PDI index, and ZP of the vesicle
solutions were determined by using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS instrument
(Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK). The vesicle solutions
were stored at 4 °C and used within two weeks. Just before preparing
the SLBs for QCM measurements, the vesicle solutions were diluted
with a 20 mM HEPES/150 mM NaCl/5 mM CaCl2 buffer solution
with pH 7.4 to a total lipid content of 0.1 mg/mL.

2.3.3 HT-29 Cell Membrane Extraction and Use for
SLB Formation on QCM Sensors
HT-29 cell pellets (cells cultured
as described in Section 2.5.1.) collected from 8 cell culture flasks were suspended
in 10 mL of a harvest buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM mannitol, pH
7). The obtained cell suspension was centrifuged at 800g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was thrown away. This
step was repeated twice. The residue was further suspended in 10 mL
of a membrane buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM mannitol, and 2 mM EGTA,
pH 7). The obtained cell suspension was transferred into a cell homogenizer
and homogenized by 40 strokes followed by incubation on ice for 1
h. The cells homogenized were transferred into a Falcon tube and centrifuged
at 800g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
from this step was taken and centrifuged at 15 000g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was again taken and further
centrifuged at 100 000g for 1.15 h at 4 °C.
Finally, the supernatant was removed and the pellet formed by the
cell membrane extract was weighed and stored at −75 °C
until used. Just before use in QCM measurements, the HT-29 cell membrane
extract pellet was suspended in a 20 mM Hepes/150 mM NaCl buffer solution
with pH 7.4 to reach a concentration of 10 mg/mL of the membrane extract.
This suspension was further mixed by using a 27G needle by filling
and emptying the syringe with the whole suspension. Hereafter, the
suspension was sonicated for 20 min until the solution no longer appeared
cloudy and used immediately. A qualitative test for the presence of
proteins in the extracted cell membrane suspension was performed using
a BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit, which verified that the cell membrane
extract contained a substantial amount of protein. The HT-29 cell
membrane extract was diluted as such or in a mixture with different
mass ratios of EggPC vesicles (1/1, 1/1.5 1/2, and 1/2.5, respectively)
in order to find the optimized cell membrane extract/EggPC ratio for
SLB formation. The HT-29 cell membrane extract and cell membrane extract/EggPC
mixtures were diluted with a 20 mM HEPES/150 mM NaCl/5 mM CaCl2 buffer solution with pH 7.4 to a cell membrane extract/lipid
concentration of 0.14 mg/mL just before performing the QCM measurements
for verifying SLB formation.

2.3.4 QCM
Measurements
QCM measurements
were performed at 20 °C by using an impedance-based QCM instrument
(QCM-Z500, KSV Instruments, Helsinki, Finland). Measurement data for
frequency (f) and dissipation (D) were acquired at the fundamental frequency (5 MHz) and several
overtone frequencies (15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 MHz). The interaction
of the noncoated and chitosan, WGA- and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs with
DOPC/DOPS and the HT-29 cell membrane extract/EggPC SLBs were performed
by monitoring QCM signal responses for a fixed time of 30 min when
1 mg/mL of the NPs were injected into the QCM flow channel. The flow
rate during the QCM interaction measurements was kept constant at
50 μL/min, and a 20 mM HEPES/150 mM NaCl buffer solution with
pH 7.4 was used as the running buffer during the measurements. The
frequency and dissipation changes reported for the QCM measurements
are the normalized signal changes for the 3rd overtone frequency,
if not otherwise stated.

2.4 SPR Studies
2.4.1 Immobilization of Cells on SPR Sensors
Gold-coated
SPR sensor slides (Bionavis Ltd., Tampere, Finland)
were cleaned by boiling in a solution of high purity water, 30% hydrogen
peroxide, and 30% ammonium hydroxide solution (5/1/1; v/v/v) for 5
min. After boiling, the sensor slides were rinsed thoroughly with
high purity water and dried by aspirating them. The SPR sensors were
hereafter autoclaved before cell immobilization. The immobilization
of HT-29 cells (cultured as described in Section 2.5.1.) on the SPR sensor slides was performed
by first treating confluent cell layers in cell culture flasks with
trypsin in DPBS after which the cells were resuspended in the cell
culture medium. The SPR sensor slide was then placed in a cell culturing
polystyrene Petri dish with a cell growth area of 8.8 cm2 and 2 mL of the cell suspension was pipetted on the SPR sensor slide.
The optimum seeding density for culturing the HT-29 cells on the SPR
sensor slides was ∼1 × 104 cells/Petri dish.
The cells were allowed to grow on the SPR sensor slides until they
reached 90–100% confluence.

2.4.2 SPR
Measurements
The interaction
between noncoated and chitosan, WGA-, and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs and
immobilized HT-29 cells at 37 °C were monitored by using a Multi-Parametric
SPR instrument (MP-SPR Navi 200, BioNavis Ltd, Tampere, Finland) equipped
with a single flow channel with two detection spots. The signal responses
in the SPR measurements were recorded simultaneously with a laser
wavelength of 785 nm in two different positions in the flow channel
(upper and lower flow channel positions) on the same sensor covered
with a cell monolayer. The NP sample solutions for SPR measurements
were prepared by diluting the H2O-based stock formulations
to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL of the corresponding C-PLGA NP
formulation with the running medium (DMEM supplemented with 10 mM
HEPES, pH: 7.4), just before performing each SPR experiment. The baseline
for the SPR measurements was measured for ∼60 min by flowing
the running medium through the SPR flow channel at a constant flow
rate of 10 μL/min. After the baseline signal was stabilized,
the sample solution was injected into the SPR flow channel by replacing
the running medium with the sample solution. The interaction of the
NP formulations with HT-29 cells were monitored at a constant flow
speed of 10 μL/min by recording the full SPR spectra between
60 and 78° every 3 s for up to 90 min. Because the full SPR angular
spectrum was recorded, the bulk effect caused by the difference in
the refractive index of the DMEM running buffer and the samples (i.e.,
diluted H2O-based stock solutions of the NPs in DMEM) was
compensated for by subtracting the contribution of the total internal
reflection angle (TIR; sensitive for bulk refractive index changes)
from the overall change in the main SPR peak angular position (SPR
PAP). The corrected SPR responses were then used for further analysis.
Light microscope images (Leica DM IL LED microscope with 5× and
10× magnifications) of the HT-29 cell monolayers were taken immediately
before and after each SPR experiment in order to evaluate the integrity
of the cell monolayer.

2.5 In vitro Cell Studies with
Noncoated and Coated
C-PLGA NPs
2.5.1 Cell Culture and Cell Preparation
Human Caucasian colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) obtained from the European
Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) were cultured in
a McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS at a density
of about 2 × 106 cells/mL in a 75 cm2 culture
flask. The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 95% relative humidity,
and 5% CO2. The cells were harvested weekly from plastic
flasks (75 cm2) with TrypLE Express and the medium was
changed twice per week.

2.5.2 Cellular Drug Uptake
Assay
HT-29
cells were cultured in a 12-well plate with a cell density of 1 ×
104 cells/per well and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h before cellular drug uptake studies.
The cell association assay was carried out at 37 °C in OPTI-MED-reduced
serum medium containing enough pure curcumin or the noncoated or coated
C-PLGA NP formulations so that each well contained the same absolute
amount of 200 μg curcumin. Washing the wells with ice-cold PBS
three times terminated incubation of the cells with pure curcumin
or the NPs. The washed cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton
X-100, then vortexed for 3 min followed by centrifugation of the cell
lysate for 10 min at 1200g to remove insoluble materials.
The supernatant was transferred to another tube and the amount of
curcumin was determined by diluting the supernatant with a mobile
phase mixture (composed of (A) 38% acetonitrile and (B) 62% of a 0.05%
phosphoric acid solution) and measured with an AcquityTM ultraperformance
liquid chromatography instrument at λmax = 426 nm
(Waters Corp., Milford, Massachusetts, USA).

2.5.3 In
Vitro Cytotoxicity of Noncoated and Coated
C-PLGA NPs
Cytotoxicity assays were performed by incubating
HT-29 cancer cell lines with curcumin in solution, noncoated and chitosan,
WGA- and GE11-coated C- PLGA NPs. Cells were treated with the same
absolute amount of curcumin (200 μg). HT-29 cells were seeded
in 96-well plates and after the attachment of cells; the plates were
washed twice with 100 μL of PBS. After washing, the sample solutions
were added to the wells. The wells were then incubated for 2 h. After
incubation, the samples were removed by pipetting and 10 μL
of MTT solution was added to each well. The plates were further incubated
for 3 h and the MTT solution was removed. The blue crystals formed
in each well were dissolved with 200 μL of DMSO. Absorbance
values from the wells were measured at 550 nm with a Multiscan GO
Microplate Spectrophotometer (ThermoFischer Scientific, Finland).
Cell viability was calculated based on the absorbance values.

2.6 In Vivo Experiments and Optical Imaging
2.6.1 Mice
Six to eight week old female
BALB/c mice were obtained from and housed in the IOV-IRCCS Specific
Pathogen Free (SPF) animal facility. Procedures involving animals
and their care were in conformity with institutional guidelines (D.L.
26/2014, and subsequent implementing circulars), and the experimental
protocol was approved by the local “Organismo Preposto al Benessere
Animale” (OPBA) of Padua University, and authorized by the
Italian Ministry of Health (Authorization n.1050/2015-PR).

2.6.2 In Vivo Biodistribution of Noncoated and
Ligand Coated C-PLGA NPs
The noncoated and coated C-PLGA
NPs were labeled with a near-IR dye, that is Cy5.5, by using Cy5.5-PEG-NH2. The labeling of the NPs was carried out by using a similar
two-step EDC/NHS method as described for WGA lectin or GE11 peptide
functionalization of the C-PLGA NPs, as described in Section 2.2.3. In vivo
optical imaging studies were conducted to evaluate the biodistribution
of the labeled NPs in the GIT of mice. BALB/c mice were placed on
a low-manganese diet to reduce autofluorescence from normal mouse
chow. Five days later, animals were randomly divided into three groups
of four animals each, and treated with Cy5.5-coated noncoated C-PLGA,
WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs. The Cy5.5-labeled NP formulations
were administered by oral gavage in a total volume of 200 μL.
The in vivo total body scanning was performed at different time points
using an Explore Optix instrument (ART, Advanced Research Technologies,
Montreal, Canada) by setting the excitation pulsing laser at 650 nm
and recording the emission at 710 nm, thus performing a time course
scanning of animals (spatial resolution/scan step fixed at 1.5 mm,
exposure time 0.1 s, and laser power automatically adjusted for each
scan session). At 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h the animals were anesthetized
with a continuous flow of 5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture and placed
inside a 37 °C heated camera box and a longitudinal whole body
fluorescence image was recorded. Before imaging, the anesthesia was
maintained using a nose cone delivery system for the duration of image
acquisition. One mouse from each group was imaged at 2 h post administration
and then sacrificed, and the abdominal cavity was opened to visualize
the GIT at place. Thereafter, the entire GIT was removed and imaged
alone, followed by imaging of the carcass.

3 Results and Discussions
3.1 Preparation
and Biopharmaceutical Characterization
of Curcumin-Loaded PLGA NPs
3.1.1 NP Preparation
Curcumin-loaded
PLGA NPs (C-PLGA NPs) were coated with chitosan (CS), WGA or GE11
peptide (GE11) for selective or targeted uptake of the NPs to HT-29
colon cancer cells in order to improve the delivery of curcumin to
the cells.

CS, a polycationic mucoadhesive polysaccharide, was
adsorbed on the negatively charged C-PLGA NP surface by coulombic
interaction. The NP decoration was carried out by using 0.25, 0.50,
and 1% CS solutions that yielded different CS densities on the NP
surface, that is, 0.25% CS-C-PLGA, 0.50% CS-C-PLGA, and 1% CS-C-PLGA
NPs, respectively. WGA, a mucoadhesive glycoprotein, was chemically
anchored to the carboxyl groups on the C-PLGA NP surface through a
condensation process to yield WGA-C-PLGA NPs coated with 33.0 ±
1.4 μg WGA/mg C-PLGA. NPs targeting colorectal cancer cells
(GE11-C-PLGA NPs) were obtained through chemical conjugation of GE1144 peptide to C-PLGA NPs which resulted in 38.1
± 1.0 μg GE11 peptide/mg C-PLGA. The degree of NP functionalization
calculated based on the C-PLGA NP size (220 ± 2 nm) and the PLGA
NP density (1.2 mg/cm3)45 was
found to correspond to a mean of 3.7 WGA molecules/NP and 82 GE11
peptides/NP. The coupling efficiency of WGA and the GE11 peptide ligand
was calculated by using eq 2 and was 74.5% and 82.7%, respectively.

3.1.2 Physicochemical Characterization of Noncoated
and Coated C-PLGA NPs
The dynamic light scattering (DLS)
data reported in Table 1 show that the CS coating significantly increased the size of the
noncoated C-PLGA NPs, while the PDI remained constant. The high negative
zeta potential of the noncoated C-PLGA NPs originates from the presence
of a high density of terminal carboxyl groups of PLGA. Coating the
C-PLGA NPs with CS solutions with different polysaccharide concentrations
(i.e., 0.25, 0.5 and 1%) yielded NPs with similar particle sizes and
PDIs, while the zeta potential values increased with increasing CS
concentration. Thus, the use of increasing CS concentrations for coating
C-PLGA NPs obviously resulted in an increased CS deposition on the
NP surface. The 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs exhibited a significantly higher
positive zeta potential compared to the other CS-coated NPs, which
could result in high mucoadhesive properties. The WGA and GE11 decoration
did not substantially affect the size of the coated C-PLGA NPs probably
because of the limited number of protein and peptide molecules conjugated
on the particle surfaces. However, WGA and GE11 conjugation reduced
the absolute value of the negative zeta-potential of the NPs, but
the particles still maintained a negative zeta potential. The slight
quenching of the negative zeta potential obtained by WGA and GE11
conjugation can be attributed to the limited number of carboxyl groups
engaged in the protein conjugation and to the overall positive charge
of these polypeptidic molecules with isoelectric points of 9 and 9.76,
respectively. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in the
case of WGA-C-PLGA NPs bearing only ∼4 lectin molecules/NP,
the zeta potential is highly negative −20.5 mV, while in the
case of GE11-C-PLGA NPs bearing about 82 peptide molecules/NP the
zeta potential was −10.8 mV. These results indicate that the
noncoated C-PLGA NPs were successfully modified with both ligands.

The TEM images reported in Figure 1 show that all NPs had regular spherical shapes indicating
that the surface coating did not influence the particle morphology.
The slightly smaller size (i.e., <200 nm) observed by TEM compared
to DLS is in agreement with the dry state of NPs, while DLS provides
the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs. Table 1 shows that the noncoated C-PLGA NPs have
a high curcumin encapsulation efficiency (EE 74%). The encapsulation
efficiency of the coated NPs was slightly lower compared to the noncoated
C-PLGA NPs which may be ascribed to partial curcumin release during
the coating process.14,38,39

3.1.3 In
Vitro Drug Release
Curcumin
release was assessed by NP incubation in three different pH release
media simulating: gastric fluid (SGF), small intestine fluid (SIF),
and colon fluid (SCF) (Figure S1). The
sequential incubation of noncoated C-PLGA NPs in SGF (1–2 h
in Figure S1) and SIF (3–5 h in Figure S1) yielded a 10% curcumin release within
5 h (Figure S1). Hereafter, when the noncoated
C-PLGA NPs were incubated in SIF media a biphasic profile with a burst
release with 56% of curcumin released within the first 24 h was followed
by a slow release over a period of 48 h yielding a final curcumin
release of 78% (6–24 h in Figure S1). These results are in agreement with the higher curcumin solubility
at pH 7.4 with respect to acidic conditions.46

Noncoated C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs showed similar
curcumin release profiles, suggesting that the surface modification
of C-PLGA NPs with a few protein or peptide molecules does not remarkably
affect the drug release properties of the formulation. In SCF during
the first burst phase, the WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA NPs released
about 62 and 54% of the loaded drug, respectively. Then, the release
slowly continued up to 76% for WGA-C-PLGA and 84% for GE11-C-PLGA
NPs in 48 h. The CS coating had a stronger effect on the drug release
from the NPs compared to WGA and GE11. The 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs showed
in fact a slower curcumin release compared to the other formulations:
about 42 and 58% of the loaded curcumin was released in 24 h and in
48 h, respectively. The slower release observed after CS coating may
be because of the CS layer on the NP surface that represents a barrier
to the diffusion of curcumin.47 Furthermore,
the affinity of curcumin for CS may also reduce the drug availability.

The kinetic data obtained by the elaboration of the in vitro release
profiles (Table S1) show that the curcumin
release from all the C-PLGA NPs fits the Higuchi diffusion model,48,49 which is in agreement with the fact that degradation of PLGA can
last from weeks to months.50

3.1.4 In Vitro Adsorption of Crude PM
The mucoadhesive properties
of the NP formulations were evaluated
by adsorption of PM on the surface of C-PLGA, 0.25, 0.5, and 1% CS-C-PLGA,
WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs. The noncoated C-PLGA NPs adsorbed
22.29% of PM after 2 h incubation at 37 °C (Figure S2). According to its well-known mucoadhesivity, chitosan-coated
NPs showed high PM adsorption, which was 3.0, 3.2, and 3.4-fold compared
to C-PLGA NPs in the case of 0.25, 0.50, and 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs, respectively.
These results indicate that in this coating range the density of chitosan
and the positive charge on the NP surface has a limited effect on
their final mucoadhesivity. This may be due to a surface saturation
by PM even at low chitosan density.51 PM
adsorption on WGA-C-PLGA was 2.3-fold compared to the noncoated C-PLGA
NPs, indicating that a limited amount of this protein has a remarkable
effect on mucoadhesion properties of the NPs. The PM interaction with
WGA-C-PLGA NPs is attributed to specific binding with the N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and sialic acid residues
of PM glycoproteins.52 Unexpectedly, also
GE11, a nonmucoadhesive peptide, was found to increase the PM adsorption
on the NPs of about 2-fold. The GE11-C-PLGA NPs/PM association probably
occurs through nonspecific coulombic GE11/mucin interactions.

3.1.5 In Vitro Stability of Different C-PLGA NPs
Stability
studies of the C-PLGA NPs were carried out by storing
the NPs in high purity water at RT and 4 °C for up to 4 months. Table S2 shows that the particle size and PDI
of noncoated C-PLGA, 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs
did not change over time indicating that the NPs have a good long-term
stability. On the contrary, the 0.25 and 0.50% CS-C-PLGA NPs showed
a significant size and PDI increase after 1 month storage. The lower
stability of 0.25 and 0.5% CS-PLGA NPs compared to the other NPs can
be attributed to the low zeta potential (+2.5 and +4.5 mV, respectively, Table 1). According to these
results, the 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs were chosen
for further studies.

In view of oral delivery, the colloidal
stability of the NPs was also investigated by incubating noncoated
C-PLGA, 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs at 37 °C
for up to 2 h in SGF, up to 6 h in SIF, and up to 24 h in SCF to simulate
GI-tract residence times. All NPs except 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs were stable
in the three fluids without relevant particle size and PDI changes
(Table S3). The size increase of 1% CS-C-PLGA
NPs in SGF may be due to a change of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface
balance that results in a more hydrophobic surface. This hypothesis
seems to be confirmed by the high stability observed when the 1% CS-C-PLGA
NPs were incubated in SIF, which contains the bile acid taurocholate
that apparently stabilizes the 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs because of its surfactant
properties.

3.2 Interaction of Different
C-PLGA NPs with Biomembranes
and Cells
3.2.1 QCM Analyses with Supported Lipid Bilayer
The interaction of noncoated C-PLGA, 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA,
and GE11-C-PLGA NPs with cell model membranes were investigated by
using the QCM technique in combination with SLBs composed of a simple
two-component phospholipid mixture (DOPC/DOPS, 75/25 mol %) or a mixture
of HT-29 cell membrane extract and EggPC. DOPC/DOPS SLBs were used
to mimic the negative charge of natural cell membranes. The HT-29
cell membrane extract incorporated into the EggPC SLB was used to
evaluate the interaction of NPs with biological targets. The DOPC/DOPS
and the HT-29 cell membrane extract/EggPC vesicle mixtures were spread
on the silica-coated QCM sensor to form the SLBs according to standard
protocols reported in the literature.29,30

Figure 2 shows the adsorption-bursting
behavior typically observed in QCM responses during vesicle spreading
when SLBs are formed. Table 2 reports the size and zeta potential of the vesicles used
to form the SLBs, as well as the equilibrium frequency change, Δf, for the SLB. The size of the vesicles obtained with the
HT-29 cell membrane extract/EggPC resembled the size of plain EggPC
vesicles, while the zeta potential was close to the average of the
components. This result suggests that the HT-29 cell membrane extract
components and EggPC are incorporated in the hybrid vesicles. The
equilibrium frequency values obtained with the SLBs in this study
are well in line with the values of typical SLBs reported in the literature.30

Figure 3 shows the
changes in QCM frequency and dissipation at the 3rd overtone during
the interaction of various NPs with DOPC/DOPS SLBs. The NPs were injected
over the SLBs at time t = 0. After 30 min, buffer
was injected to rinse the system and clear out the NPs that did not
interact with the SLBs (vertical dashed line). The frequency and dissipation
changes indicate the extent and the type of the NP interaction with
the SLBs. The QCM measurements show that the various NPs underwent
similar reversible interaction with the DOPC/DOPS SLBs, except for
the 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs that showed a slightly higher dissipation change
during sample injection compared to the other NPs. Additionally, the
frequency and dissipation signals in the case of 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs
do not return to the starting level when flushing with running buffer,
as observed with the other NPs. This is probably a consequence of
electrostatic interactions between the highly positively charged 1%
CS-C-PLGA NPs (zeta potential ≈ +33 mV) and the negatively
charged DOPC/DOPS SLB (∼−27 mV).

dissipation changes at the 3rd overtone during interaction of noncoated
and coated C-PLGA NPs with a DOPC/DOPS (75:25 mol %) SLB. Arrows indicate
time point for injection of different PLGA NPs and the vertical dashed
line indicates the time point for flushing with the running buffer.

In the case of the HT-29 cell membrane extract/EggPC
SLBs the small
frequency (∼3 Hz) and dissipation (∼1 × 10–6) changes at the 3rd overtone during the interaction
of the noncoated C-PLGA NPs reported in Figure 4 indicate that NP/SLB interactions occurs
according to weak associations. The 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and
GE11-C-PLGA NPs showed higher frequency changes (40, 40, and 15 Hz,
respectively) and dissipation changes (25 × 10–6, 20 × 10–6 and 10 × 10–6, respectively) compared to noncoated C-PLGA NPs (Figure 4). The 1% CS-C-PLGA displayed
the highest QCM responses corresponding to over 10 times higher signal
responses compared to the ones obtained with noncoated C-PLGA NPs.
This strong adsorption of 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs on the HT-29 cell membrane
extract/EggPC SLBs can be ascribed to nonspecific electrostatic interactions
between the negatively charged SLBs and the positively charged NPs.
Interestingly, the QCM responses obtained with WGA-C-PLGA NPs were
similar to those obtained with 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs despite the fact that
the former possessed a highly negative surface charge. The GE11-C-PLGA
NPs induced lower QCM responses compared to 1% CS-C-PLGA and WGA-C-PLGA
NPs, but still significantly higher (over 5 times higher) compared
to the noncoated C-PLGA NPs. Because both WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA
NPs are negatively charged, the NP adsorption on these SLBs occurs
through specific binding. The WGA-C-PLGA NPs can specifically interact
with glycoproteins and -lipids on the cell membrane surface, namely, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid residues, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs interact with
the HT-29 cell receptors. The weaker interaction of GE11-C-PLGA NPs
compared to WGA-C-PLGA NPs could be ascribed to a difference in density
of the receptors for the two targeting agents on the HT-29 cell membrane
extract/EggPC SLB or different binding affinities.

PLGA NPs and the vertical dashed line indicates the time point for
flushing with the running buffer.

3.2.2 SPR Analyses with HT-29 Cell Monolayers
In order to elucidate the mechanism of the NP interaction with
living cells, SPR measurements were carried out with confluent colon
cancer HT-29 cell monolayers. The immobilization of HT-29 cell monolayers
on the SPR sensors was validated before each interaction measurement
by measuring the full SPR angular spectrum of the cell monolayer. Figure 5A shows that the
main SPR PAP and the shape of the TIR region of the full SPR angular
spectrum when the HT-29 cell monolayer is immobilized are substantially
shifted to higher angles with respect to the spectrum obtained with
a pure gold-coated SPR sensor (from ∼66° to ∼69°).
A SPR PAP at about 69° and the smooth shape of the TIR area confirmed
the confluence of the HT-29 cell layer.34,35,53 The HT-29 cell monolayer confluence on the SPR sensors
was also confirmed by optical microscopy. The microscopy images reported
in Figure 5B,C show
the cell confluence and cell integrity without changes in the morphology
after SPR measurements.

Figure 5 (A) Full SPR angular spectra of a pure gold-coated
SPR sensor (dashed
black line) and a confluent HT-29 cell monolayer-covered SPR sensor
(solid blue line). The large shift in the SPR PAP and the TIR region
to higher angles, and the smoother shape in the TIR region confirms
the presence of a confluent cell monolayer. (B) Optical microscope
image of a confluent HT-29 cell monolayer on a gold-coated SPR sensor.
(C) Optical microscope image of the HT-29 cell monolayer after an
SPR interaction measurement demonstrating the preserved cell monolayer
integrity.

The SPR signals obtained during
the injection of pure curcumin
solution reported in Figure S3A show an
initial negative shift followed by a leveling out and slow increase
of the SPR PAP. The noncoated and coated C-PLGA NPs showed also an
initial negative shift with a minimum SPR PAP signal in the range
of 3–10 min followed by an increase (>10 min) (Figure S3B–E). Initial negative shifts
were observed in the TIR angular position as well (Figure S3). In contrast to the SPR PAP, the TIR angular position
remained constant after the initial negative shift. This can be attributed
to the fact that the TIR angular position is only sensitive to changes
in bulk refractive indexes, while the SPR PAP is sensitive to refractive
index changes in the close vicinity of the sensor surface. Thus, the
initial negative decrease of the SPR responses can be attributed to
optical differences (i.e., different refractive indexes) between the
running buffer (DMEM supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and the
injected sample solutions, which were actually formulations in aqueous
medium diluted in the running buffer. The initial decrease in both
SPR signals is due to an increase of water content in the samples
because water has a lower refractive index than the running buffer.
However, the increase in the SPR PAP responses after the initial decrease,
which is not seen in the TIR angular position responses, can be attributed
to NP-cell surface interactions and NP-cell uptake.

The TIR angular position responses were subtracted
from the corresponding
SPR PAP responses to evaluate the targeting and cell uptake events
of the curcumin formulations (Figure S3). This removed any contribution of optical differences between the
curcumin formulations and the running buffer, and provided an SPR
response that only reflects the targeting and cell uptake events of
the different curcumin formulations.

Figure 6A shows
that the interaction kinetics of the NPs obtained by the TIR-subtracted SPR responses
measured in the lower position of the flow channel are in good agreement
with the results obtained by the QCM combined with the HT-29 cell
membrane extract/EggPC SLB analysis. The targeting and cell uptake
of the various NPs could then be estimated by integrating the area
under the TIR-subtracted SPR responses reported in Figure 6B. The integrated areas show
that the HT-29 cell interaction and internalization of 1% CS-C-PLGA,
WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs are clearly higher compared to those
obtained with curcumin in solution and noncoated C-PLGA NPs.

curcumin solution and different C-PLGA NPs with HT-29 cells (measured

curcumin solution and different C-PLGA NPs measured on two separate
positions (lower and upper flow channel positions) on the same sensor
with confluent HT-29 cell monolayers. SPR measurements with each formulation
were performed on different HT-29 cell-covered SPR sensors.

3.2.3 In Vitro Cell Uptake
and Cytotoxicity Studies
In order to corroborate the real-time
label-free QCM and SPR results,
in vitro cell uptake and cytotoxicity assays were performed using
HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Figure 7A shows the HT-29 cell uptake of curcumin
after 2 h incubation. The cell uptake of curcumin in solution was
3.7 ± 0.6 μg/104 cells, while the curcumin uptake
from noncoated C-PLGA, 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs
was 7.0 ± 0.3, 13.5 ± 1.0, 26.0 ± 1.3, and 27.3 ±
4.9 μg/104 cells, respectively. These results are
in good agreement with the cell interaction data obtained by QCM and
SPR analysis reported above, and demonstrate that the selective NP
interaction achieved with WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA is much more
efficient than nonselective cell interaction obtained with 1% CS-C-PLGA.
It should be noted that CS is a highly positively charged mucoadhesive
material. Consequently, the interactions of 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs with
mucin (Figure S2) and the HT-29 membrane
extract/EggPC SLB are primarily electrostatic in nature (Figure 4). However, the interaction
of 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs with HT-29 cells measured by SPR was lower compared
to WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA NPs (Figure 6). Furthermore, the nonselective interaction
of 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs with cells may result in a different cell-uptake
mechanism compared to the targeted NPs, which consequently could lead
to differences in the intracellular delivery of curcumin. Accordingly,
the 1% CS-C-PLGA NPs were less efficient in the intracellular delivery
compared to WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA NPs.

Figure 7 (A) In vitro cell uptake
of curcumin and (B) cell viability after
2 h incubation with pure curcumin solution, noncoated C-PLGA, and
coated C-PLGA NPs with HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (mean
± SD, n = 3). Not significant (N.S.), * significant
difference at the 0.05 level.

The cytotoxicity results reported in Figure 7B are in agreement with the cell uptake results
shown in Figure 7A
and confirm that curcumin is indeed released from the NPs. After 2
h, incubation with curcumin in solution or formulated with noncoated
C-PLGA, 1% CS-C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs, the HT-29 cell
viability was 83 ± 16, 96 ± 11, 79 ± 11, 62 ±
8, and 43 ± 13%, respectively. It is worth noting that the active
targeting obtained with WGA-C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA NPs yields the
highest cytotoxicity with a significant difference compared to the
noncoated C-PLGA NPs.

Importantly, the QCM data (Figure 4) are in fair agreement with
the cell uptake and cytotoxicity
results obtained by NP incubation with HT-29 cells, demonstrating
that this sophisticated technique can be properly exploited to obtain
relevant information about the cell-targeting capability of colloidal
drug delivery systems. Also, the SPR results (Figure 6) are in very good agreement with the higher
curcumin uptake obtained by traditional in vitro cell uptake assay.

3.3 In Vivo Delivery of Noncoated and Targeted
C-PLGA NPs
A preliminary in vivo comparative delivery study
was carried out to verify that the targeted C-PLGA NPs with colon-selective
agents, namely WGA and GE11, could withstand other GI tract conditions
before reaching the colon, and to confirm their colon selectivity
of these NPs. The study was performed by oral administration to mice
of Cy5.5 labeled noncoated C-PLGA, WGA-C-PLGA, and GE11-C-PLGA NPs.
The images reported in Figure 8 show that all NPs partially remained in the stomach up to
6 h from administration. However, noncoated C-PLGA and GE11-C-PLGA
NPs were cleared out without deposition in the colon while high fluorescence
signal corresponding to WGA-C-PLGA NPs was found in the colon, indicating
that these NPs adsorb to this GI tract. These results are in fair
agreement with the cell affinity of the NPs discussed above. WGA-C-PLGA
NPs can in fact recognize the glycoproteins and glycolipids of the
normal cells of colon. On the contrary, neither the noncoated C-PLGA
nor the GE11-PLGA NPs have a specific target in the colon of healthy
mice, and consequently they did not deposit in this GI tract as observed
by the images reported in Figure 8.

Figure 8 In vivo optical images of mice orally administered with
(A) noncoated
C-PLGA, (B) WGA-C-PLGA and (C) GE11-C-PLGA NPs labeled with Cy5.5.
Left panels show one representative mouse per group imaged at different
time points (30 min to 24 h) after gavage. An additional mouse from
each group was imaged at 2 h post administration and then sacrificed,
to expose and visualize the GIT at place for fluorescent NP detection.
Thereafter, the entire GIT was removed and imaged alone, followed
by imaging of the remaining carcass (right panels).

4 Conclusions
Curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs
were successfully prepared and coated
with chitosan, WGA and GE11 to yield drug carriers for ameliorating
curcumin delivery to HT-29 colon cancer cells. The properties of the
coated C-PLGA NPs were comparatively investigated by standard in vitro
physicochemical techniques. Stability studies revealed a good colloidal
stability of the coated C-PLGA NPs formulations in synthetic gastrointestinal
fluids. The NP interactions and cell uptake were studied by means
of innovative investigational techniques, namely, QCM combined with
SLBs and SPR combined with living cells. The QCM and SPR techniques
in combination with biomimetic sensing layers were found to be successful
tools to investigate the targeting properties of NPs. These innovative
techniques allowed in fact for elucidating a few aspects of NP/cell
interactions and uptake providing for the correlation between the
nature of the coating and the cell selectivity. The results showed
that CS-coated C-PLGA NPs can interact with the cells by nonspecific
electrostatic mechanisms, while WGA- and GE11-coated C-PLGA NPs mediate
active recognition of specific cell targets.
