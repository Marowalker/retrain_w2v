Ratiometric sensing
systems transduced through independent analyte-sensitive
response signals, which are simultaneously obtained from a single
material, are highly desired to improve sensing reliability and sensitivity.
In this study, a dual-model ratiometric sensing system with fluorescence
and second-order light scattering (SOS) as transducing signals has
been designed for the ratiometric detection of alkaline phosphatase
(ALP). Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) made of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)] are prepared
and used as reducing and stabilizing agents to prepare MnO2 nanosheets in situ through the reduction of KMnO4. The
formed SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids exhibit independent fluorescence
and SOS response to ALP by using l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate
trisodium salt as the enzyme substrate. Benefiting from the simultaneous
availability of fluorescence and SOS signals under the same excitation,
a ratiometric probe has been constructed successfully for ALP sensing.
Under optimal conditions, the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids for
ALP detection show a good linear detection range from 0.1 to 9.0 U
L–1 with a detection limit of 0.034 U L–1. Additionally, a visual and portable sensing device for ALP detection
is also constructed based on the fluorescent performances of the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids. We believe the proposed method with the in situ
preparation of SPN-based hybrid probes via the reducing ability of
SPNs will pave a new way for the construction of multifunctional sensing
materials in chemo-/biosensing applications.

Introduction
Multidimensional sensing
mechanism, which relies on more than one
signal transduction channel, has attracted significant attention because
of the merits of increased accuracy and simultaneous detection of
multiple analytes.1−7 Especially, it is of great interest to simultaneously obtain multidimensional
transducing signals responsive to a target analyte from a single sensing
material for constructing ratiometric sensing systems because ratiometric
sensing systems generally can effectively avoid or reduce analyte-independent
interfering signals (i.e., false-positive or negative errors) that
resulted from several unconquerable factors including instrumental
fluctuation, variation of ambient environmental conditions, and background
signals of samples.8−12 Thus far, it is still a challenge to construct ratiometric sensing
systems using independent multidimensional transducing signals from
a single sensing material, which could improve the analysis reliability
utilizing different transduction principles.

Alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), one of the nonspecific hydrolases found
in body tissues, is considered as an important biomarker for clinical
diagnosis.13 An accurate and reliable detection
of ALP level is extremely important for the treatment of many diseases,
such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
bone metastasis from prostate carcinoma, and so on.14,15 Although ratiometric sensing systems have been reported for the
determination of ALP activity,16−18 these sensors are constructed
using only a single-mode transducing signal and obtain the ratiometric
signals from fluorescence intensities at different wavelengths or
currents at different potentials.16−18 An ideal strategy to
meet challenges is to construct ratiometric probes with independent
dual-dimensional signals that can be obtained simultaneously. Among
the conventional available analytical signals including potential,
current, fluorescence, phosphorescence, Raman signal, and fluorescence
polarization, fluorescence and light-scattering signals are very easy
to obtain simultaneously under the same excitation with an ordinary
fluorometer.6 In addition, the fluorescence
and the scattering signal could be used for fluorescence imaging and
dark-field imaging with an epifluorescence microscope, respectively.
However, ratiometric fluorescent sensors with scattering signal and
fluorescence from a single sensing material remain rarely reported,
especially for enzyme activity analysis. Therefore, ratiometric sensing,
taking advantages of the scattering signal and fluorescence, may provide
a promising method for ALP detection.

In recent years, studies
on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles
(SPNs) in the field of chemo-/biosensing have attracted widespread
attention.19−23 Compared to commonly used fluorophores including organic dyes, inorganic
nanoparticles, and upconversion materials, SPNs, which mainly consist
of π-conjugated polymers, have emerged as excellent candidates
and more competent fluorescent probes for constructing chemo-/biosensors
because of their excellent performances, such as extraordinary fluorescence
brightness, high emission rate, excellent photostability, amplified
energy transfer, flexibility, and nontoxicity.24−28 Recently, extensive attention has been focused on
the SPN-based nanohybrids through the assembly of SPNs with inorganic
materials because the nanohybrids may display novel sensing properties.29,30 However, the construction of the SPN-based nanohybrids via postmodification
usually encounters some drawbacks, such as complicated preparation
process, easy falling off, difficult control of performance, and so
forth. Obviously, the in situ preparation of organic–inorganic
hybrid SPNs is of great interest to extend their application fields
in chemo-/biosensing.

Herein, a ratiometric sensing system using
the nanohybrids of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)] (PFBT) SPNs
and MnO2 nanosheets as signal probes, which employs fluorescence
and second-order scattering (SOS) obtained simultaneously as transduction
signals, for monitoring the ALP activity is reported. The schematic
illustration is shown in Scheme 1. In this study, the prepared PFBT SPNs are used as
resultants and stabilizers to form MnO2 nanosheets in situ
and therefore obtain SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids. Owing to the
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the SPNs and
MnO2 nanosheets, SNPs@MnO2 shows weak fluorescence.
Meanwhile, the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids display distinct SOS
signals derived from the relatively large size of nanohybrids. In
the presence of ALP, the substrate, l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate
trisodium salt (AA2P), is hydrolyzed to produce l-ascorbic
acid (AA), followed by the reduction of MnO2 nanosheets
to manganese ions (Mn2+) with AA. As a result, the fluorescence
of PFBT SPNs is restored owing to the inhibition of the energy transfer
process, whereas the SOS signals are decreased significantly because
of the decomposition of the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids. On the
basis of the switch of fluorescence and SOS signals in the absence
or presence of ALP, a ratiometric ALP activity sensor is successfully
realized with excellent analytical performances by using the two independent
signals that originated from different photophysical mechanisms. Benefiting
from the stability of the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids which were
derived from the in situ synthesis and self-calibration with two independent
signals that originated from different photophysical mechanisms, the
as-prepared probe exhibits improved reliability and enhanced sensitivity.

Results and Discussion
In Situ Preparation of SPNs@MnO2 Nanohybrids
PFBT SPNs were prepared via the nanoprecipitation
method according
to previous reports.33,34 The morphologies of the prepared
SPNs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and dynamic light scattering (DLS), respectively. Figure 1A demonstrates that the obtained
SPNs are spherical in shape with an average diameter of approximately
50 nm, which is well-consistent with the DLS measurement results (inset
in Figure 1A).

and DLS measurements (inset) of PFBT SPNs. (B) TEM
images of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids. (C) Surface zeta potential
of bare SPNs and SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids. (D) X-ray photoelectron
spectra of Mn 2p for SPNs@MnO2.

Previous studies have demonstrated that some oxidation of
polymers
occurs in the formation of SPNs from polymers and therefore enables
the hydrophobic SPNs to form an aqueous suspension with high colloidal
stability.35 Inspired by these findings,
we consider the possibility to use SPN colloids as reductants and
dispersants36 to prepare stable nanohybrids
endowed with multiple sensory elements to construct ratiometric sensing
systems. In this study, MnO2 nanosheets, a kind of two-dimensional
nanomaterials with broad light-absorbing bands and intrinsic fluorescence-quenching
abilities,37,38 were prepared via in situ reduction
of KMnO4 by using the PFBT SPNs as reductants and stabilizers. Figure 1B shows that MnO2 nanosheets with thin-layered structures are formed and that
the PFBT SPNs are attached tightly to the surface of the MnO2 nanosheets. More interestingly, compared to the MnO2 nanosheets
prepared by reducing KMnO4 with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES), the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids prepared in this
study display improved colloidal stability (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In addition, the zeta
potentials of bare SPNs and SPNs@MnO2 were measured to
be −34.58 and −29.18 mV (Figure 1C), respectively, confirming the successful
preparation of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids.

To verify the
production of MnO2 nanosheets, the obtained
SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids were characterized by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS. As shown in Figure 2D, the binding energies of the characteristic peaks
of Mn 2p1/2 are 653.4 and 653.9 eV, respectively, whereas
those of the characteristic peaks of Mn 2p3/2 are 640.8
and 642.2 eV, respectively, which represent Mn(III) and Mn(IV), respectively.
The spin-energy separation of 642.2 and 653.9 eV is 11.71 eV, which
is the typical value for MnO2 according to standard XPS
energy spectrum. The intensity percentage of Mn(IV) to the overall
Mn intensity is calculated to be about 89.3%. These results demonstrate
that Mn(IV) is predominant in the obtained MnO2 nanosheets,
further confirming the achievement of MnO2 nanosheets with
the in situ chemical reduction of KMnO4 by PFBT SPNs.

same concentrations of SPNs and SPNs@MnO2 were used in
all experiments. (B) Spectral overlap of the UV–vis absorption

spectrum of the PFBT SPNs (blue line) in 20 mM, pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer. (C) The fluorescence lifetime spectra of SPNs@MnO2 (red line) and SPNs (blue line).

To further demonstrate that SPNs can act as reducing agents
and
reduce KMnO4 into MnO2 nanosheets, a control
experiment by using the prepared PFBT SPNs to reduce HAuCl4 to form Au nanoparticles was carried out under the same conditions.
As shown in Figure S2A (Supporting Information), the fluorescence of PFBT SPNs is gradually quenched with increased
concentrations of HAuCl4 accompanying with obvious color
changes from yellow to gray under a 365 nm UV lamp (inset in Figure S2A). These results indicate that Au nanoparticles,
the well-known fluorescence quenchers, are generated in situ through
the reduction of KMnO4 by PFBT SPNs and subsequently suppress
the fluorescence of PFBT SPNs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
(Figure S2B, Supporting Information) further
supports the opinion that SPNs are reductive and can be used to prepare
Au nanoparticles in situ by reducing HAuCl4. It has to
be noted that only a small part of the double bonds of SPNs was oxidized,
and therefore there was no significant influence on its photophysical
properties in this process.

Ratiometric Sensing Mechanism of ALP Based
on Fluorescence and
SOS Signals of SPNs@MnO2 Nanohybrids
The synthesized
PFBT SPNs show distinct fluorescence emission at 536 nm (curve a in Figure 2A, left panel), which
is consistent with the results reported in the literature.39 Upon the formation of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids,
SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids display the same spectral shape as
PFBT SPNs, but the fluorescence is significantly quenched (curve b
in Figure 2A, left
panel) because of the FRET between the PFBT SPNs and MnO2 nanosheets. Figure 2B shows that the absorption of MnO2 nanosheets partially
overlaps with the emission band of SPNs, indicating that fluorescence
quenching is caused by FRET and inner filter effects, alone or in
combination. To confirm the quenching mechanism, time-resolved fluorescence
measurements were performed for SPNs@MnO2 and SPNs, respectively.
As shown in Figure 2C, the fluorescence lifetime is estimated to be 1.0799 ns for SPNs
(blue line), whereas it reduces to 0.4117 ns for SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids (red line), suggesting that the quenching mechanism
of SNPs is dominated by FRET between the SNPs and MnO2 nanosheets.
The energy transfer efficiency (E = 1 – τDA/τD, where τD and τDA are the lifetimes of the donor and the donor with acceptor,
respectively)40 between the SPNs and MnO2 nanosheets was calculated to be 61.88%. In addition, the
Stern–Volmer plot (F0/F vs cKMnO4) was also used
to characterize the quenching process. As presented in Figure S3, the Stern–Volmer plot exhibits
an excellent linearity, which is a characteristic feature of the dynamic
quenching effect, suggesting that the static quenching effect in the
quenching process can be ignored. The fluorescence quantum yield of
SPNs and SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids was determined to be 21
and 0.17%, respectively, further demonstrating the occurrence of the
intraparticle FRET of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids. However, in
the presence of ALP and AA2P, the fluorescence of the system is gradually
recovered with the increasing concentrations of ALP (curves e and
f in Figure 2A, left
panel), suggesting the FRET between them is suppressed because the
hydrolyzed product of AA2P with ALP catalysis, AA, reduces the MnO2 nanosheets to manganese ions (Mn2+).

To
confirm that the decomposition of MnO2 nanosheets by the
reduction of AA resulted from the hydrolysis of AA2P with ALP catalysis,
a control experiment was carried out by investigating the varying
UV–vis absorption spectra of MnO2 nanosheets by
the reduction of AA. As shown in Figure 3A, the MnO2 nanosheets obtained
through the reduction of KMnO4 with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) show a characteristic absorption
band around 386 nm (curve a in Figure 3A).38 However, in the presence
of AA2P and ALP, the absorbance of MnO2 nanosheets decreases
distinctly (curve b in Figure 3A) and nearly disappears upon the increase of ALP concentration
(curve c in Figure 3A), whereas AA2P and ALP do not exhibit peaks in this region (curve
d and e in Figure 3A). The studies on the varying UV–vis absorption spectra of
MnO2 nanosheets demonstrate the gradual decomposition of
MnO2 nanosheets by the reduction of different amounts of
AA. To further demonstrate the decomposition of MnO2 nanosheets,
resonance light scattering (RLS) was used to study the sensing mechanism.
After adding different concentrations of ALP into the SPNs@MnO2 system, the RLS signals gradually decreased (Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information) because of
the gradual decomposition of MnO2 nanosheets with the increasing
concentration of AA.

beam.

On the other hand, it is well-known
that the aggregation, dispersion,
or decomposition behavior of nanomaterials can result in the variation
of light-scattering signals. According to the Rayleigh scattering
theory, the intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the
square of the particle volume.41 In this
study, a controlled experiment was carried out to investigate the
variation of light-scattering signals of MnO2 nanosheets
in the presence AA2P and ALP. As shown in Figure 3B, the MnO2 nanosheets display
a strong SOS signal at 880 nm with an excitation at 440 nm (curve
a in Figure 3B). When
ALP is added, the catalytic hydrolysis product of AA2P (i.e., AA)
reduces MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+, and thus the
SOS signal is obviously reduced (curve b in Figure 3B). We can also see that the more ALP was
added, the more decreased SOS signal at 880 nm was observed (curve
c in Figure 3B). The
changes in scattering intensity are also verified by the Tyndall effect
(inset of Figure 3B).
The aqueous solution of MnO2 nanosheets exhibits a strong
Tyndall effect and is weakened drastically upon the addition of AA2P
and ALP. For comparison, the SOS spectra of different SPN systems
are also investigated. As shown in Figure 3B (curves d, e, and f), no significant changes
of the SOS spectra of SPNs in the absence or presence of AA2P and
ALP are observed, suggesting no obvious aggregation or separation
of SPNs in the reaction process.

Although the fluorescence and
SOS signals of the system can be
used independently for the detection of ALP, considering the self-calibration
function of the ratio probe, we further evaluated the feasibility
of SPNs@MnO2 as a ratiometric sensor for ALP detection. Figure 2A shows the fluorescence
and scattering spectra of SPNs@MnO2 in the absence and
presence of ALP. It can be seen that, as expected, the SPNs@MnO2 system shows weak fluorescence and strong SOS (curve b in Figure 2A), and these signals
did not show any obvious change with the addition of AA2P or ALP alone
(curves c and d in Figure 2A). With the addition of ALP in the presence of AA2P, the
fluorescence of SPNs@MnO2 at 536 nm is gradually increased,
whereas the SOS signal at 880 nm is gradually decreased accordingly
(curves e and f in Figure 2A). The results show that the SPNs@MnO2 system
may be developed as a ratiometric sensor for ALP by using fluorescence
in combination with SOS.

Response of SPNs@MnO2 Nanohybrids
toward ALP Sensing
To obtain excellent analytical performance,
the experiment conditions
including the incubation time, pH, and the concentration of AA2P were
optimized (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Under the optimized conditions, the prepared SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids were used to sensing the ALP activity. As presented
in Figure 4A, upon
the addition of ALP in the range from 0 to 11.0 U L–1 in the presence of AA2P, the fluorescence intensities of the system
increase gradually, whereas the SOS intensities decrease gradually
with the increasing concentrations of ALP. The individual analysis
results of the fluorescence and SOS signals indicate that these two
different, independent signals can be used for ALP quantification,
respectively (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Figure 4B displays
that the ratio of fluorescence intensity over SOS signal is linearly
correlated to the ALP activity ranging from 0.1 to 9 U L–1. The linear regression equation can be expressed as IF/SOS = −0.13 + 0.93 cALP (U L–1), with a linear relationship coefficient
of R2 = 0.9882 for ALP quantification.
The detection limit was determinated as low as 0.034 U L–1 based on the definition of three times the deviation of the blank
signal (3σ), which is comparative to or better than the previous
reports for ALP determination (Table S1, Supporting Information). The improved sensing performances are attributed
to the advantages of ratiometric sensor with two independent transducing
signals and SPNs with amplified sensing signals.42,43

6 U L–1 ALP. All the experiments were carried out
in 20 mM, pH 7.4 PBS with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm.

To assess the selectivity of the
obtained SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids
for ALP detection, the influence of some enzymes and proteins including
acetyl cholinesterase (AChE), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH),
tyrosinase (TyR), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), glutamate dehydrogenase
(GLDH), cholesterol oxidase (COD), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and
trypsin was investigated. As depicted in Figure 4C, in the presence of 6 U L–1 ALP, the fluorescence and SOS signals display obvious variation
(cyan line) compared to the SPNs@MnO2 solution (gray line).
However, the fluorescence and SOS signals of the system did not show
any obvious changes in the presence of 5 μg mL–1 of other enzymes or proteins (overlapped with the spectra of SPNs@MnO2), as shown in Figure 4C. Figure 4D describes that the competitive experiments also demonstrate that
the SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids exhibit an excellent ratiometric
response toward ALP in the presence of various enzymes and proteins.
These results strongly confirm the excellent specificity and selectivity
of the prepared SPNs@MnO2 nanoprobe for ALP detection.

Detection of ALP in Real Human Serum Samples
To investigate
the potential real applications of the SPNs@MnO2-based
ALP sensor in real samples, the determination of ALP in human serum
was performed. Prior to the analysis, N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM), a scavenger that specifically reacts with biothiols,44−46 was added into a human serum sample to eliminate the interferences
of glutathione and cysteine. With a proper dilution by phosphate buffer,
ALP in human serum was detected by the standard addition method, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. Recovery ranging from 97.24 to 103.40% was obtained,
indicating that the established SPNs@MnO2 nanoprobe can
be expected to be applied in clinical ALP activity analysis.

Visual and Portable Test with the SPNs@MnO2 Nanohybrids
As described above, the in situ formed SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids
can be used as integrated probes without any extra reagents for the
assay of ALP activity based on the restored fluorescence in the presence
of ALP. Figure 5A displays
the luminescent photographs of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrid solutions
under a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp with different concentrations of ALP
ranging from 0 to 9.0 U L–1. It is very clear that
the fluorescence turns on gradually with the increasing concentrations
of ALP, which can be easily captured with naked eyes because of the
inherent high brightness of SPNs.

and 3 mM AA2P (B), and color changes of the test papers before (left

The portable test papers for the
visual detection of ALP were also
constructed, as shown in Figure 5 (right panel). Cellulose acetate film with a size
of 30.0 × 15.0 × 0.25 mm was used as the supporting layer,
and a nummular paper with a diameter of 10.0 mm was used as the detection
area and soaked with a mixed solution of SPNs@MnO2 and
AA2P, and then air-dried and pasted to the supporting layer. The o-ring
plastic circle with an inner diameter of 8.0 mm, an outer diameter
of 10.0 mm, and a thickness of 1.8 mm was fixed on the paper disk,
which not only provides the reaction space for the portal test of
ALP, but also increases the mechanical strength of the test paper.
As shown in Figure 5D, when 6.0 U L–1 ALP was dropped on the reactive
area of the test paper, obvious fluorescence was observed under a
365 nm ultraviolet lamp.

Conclusions
In summary, by taking
advantage of the reductive ability of SPNs,
MnO2 nanosheets are prepared in situ without any extra
reagents through the reduction of KMnO4 to form SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids for the first time. Using the two independent
signals of fluorescence and second-order light scattering, a ratiometric
sensor is established for monitoring the ALP activity. Beyond this,
visual and portable test papers for detecting the ALP activity are
also prepared. Benefiting from the in situ preparation of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids, ratiometric sensing from independent dual-dimensional
signal, and the merits of SPNs, the built sensor exhibits several
appealing features including easy preparation, modulated performances,
improved reliability, and enhanced sensitivity. We expect that this
fluorescence nanoprobe can be extended to study the metabolism process
and the biological roles of ALP in cellular homeostasis and pathophysiological
situations.

Experimental Section
Instrumental and Reagents
Fluorescence
measurements
were performed on an LS-55 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped
with a 1.50 mL quartz cell (PerkinElmer, USA). UV–vis absorption
spectra were obtained with a UV-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).
TEM images were acquired with a Hitachi HT-7700 transmission electron
microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Luminescence lifetime was carried out on
an FLS920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK). Zeta potential
and DLS were measured by a ZS90 zetasizer (Malvern, UK).

PFBT
(MW 164 000, polydispersity 3.4) was purchased from ADSDyes, Inc. (Quebec, Canada). NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, tetrahydrofuran
(THF, anhydrous, ≥99.9%, inhibitor-free), ALP, AA2P, AchE,
NADH, TyR, ADH, GLDH, COD, BSA, trypsin, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES), and reduced NEM were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used as received. Unless indicated otherwise, all the commonly employed
reagents in this study are of at least analytical purity and used
without further purification. Ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ·cm)
was used throughout the experiments.

Preparation of PFBT SPNs
The PFBT SPNs were prepared
according to the previous procedures with some modifications.31,32 Briefly, 10 mg of PFBT polymer was dissolved in 10 mL of inhibitor-free
THF under stirring conditions to obtain the PFBT stock solution with
a concentration of 1.0 mg mL–1. Then, 250 μL
of the PFBT stock solution was further diluted into 5 mL THF, which
was mixed thoroughly by ultrasonication. Under vigorous ultrasonication,
the solution was quickly added into 10 mL of ultrapure water, and
then ultrasonication continued for 5–6 min. After this, the
THF was removed by rotary evaporation at 50 °C, and then the
solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate membrane
filter to remove any aggregates formed during the preparation. The
SPN (50 μg mL–1) solution was obtained and
stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C for following usage.

Preparation
of SPNs@MnO2 Nanohybrids
To
prepare SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids, 2.0 mL of SPNs (50 mg mL–1) and 10 mL of KMnO4 solution (1.5 mM)
were mixed and cultured in a thermostatic shaker for 10 min (200 rpm,
37 °C). The SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids were separated from
the mixture by a centrifugal filtration device (Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal
filter with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 000) at a speed
of 5000 rpm for 2 min.

Procedures for the Determination of ALP Activity
For
the determination of ALP activity, 100 μL of SPNs@MnO2 nanohybrids (50 mg mL–1) and 100 μL of AA2P
solution (30 mM) were mixed thoroughly, and then 100 μL of ALP
with different concentrations was added into the above mixed solution,
followed by adjusting the final volume to 1 mL with PBS buffer (pH
7.4, 20 mM). After incubating for 50 min at 37 °C, the fluorescence
emission spectra and SOS signal measurements were performed simultaneously
by recording the range from 480 to 900 nm with an excitation at 440
nm.

detection, the human serum was diluted 20-fold with a 20 mM PBS buffer
solution (pH 7.4), and a certain concentration of NEM (0.3 mM) was
added into the above human serum solution. Afterward, the same experimental
process was performed as described above.

Portable Test with the
SPNs@MnO2 Nanohybrids
To construct a portable
device for the practical detection of ALP,
a cellulose acetate film with a size of 30.0 × 15.0 × 0.25
mm was used as the supporting layer, and a nummular paper with a diameter
of 10.0 mm was used as the detection area and soaked with a mixed
solution of SPNs@MnO2 and AA2P, which was then air-dried
and pasted to the supporting layer. The o-ring plastic circle with
an inner diameter of 8.0 mm, an outer diameter of 10.0 mm, and a thickness
of 1.8 mm was fixed on the paper disk. A 6.0 U L–1 ALP was dropped into the reaction zone of the test paper, and then
the fluorescence response of the test paper was observed under a 365
nm ultraviolet lamp.
