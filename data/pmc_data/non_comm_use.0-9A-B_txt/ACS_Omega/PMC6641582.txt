Temperature dependencies of transient
photocharge and magnetophotoconductance
effect of columnar self-assemblies of the hexabenzocoronene derivative
(HBC-C14), which is a prospective one-dimensional photoconductor,
presented different thermal activation processes for carrier generation
and transportation, respectively. Thermal equilibrium between the
low-lying short distance and high-lying long-distance geminate electron–hole
(e–h) pairs is the origin for activation in carrier generation.
The energy difference between these e–h pairs is estimated
to be 7 meV, which was mainly due to the Coulomb interaction. On the
other hand, the carrier transport with thermal activation was understood
by the multiple trapping model. Carrier detrapping from localized
states located in the band gap causes the thermal activation in the
carrier transport. The shallow energy depth at the density peak of
the localized state from the mobility edge (10 ± 3 meV) is a
unique nature of HBC-C14 self-assemblies. A very narrow Gaussian distribution
for density of the localized states was also clarified.

1 Introduction
Photoconduction
in organic semiconductors, which is an important
physical property for organic photovoltaics and photosensors, can
be interpreted in terms of two processes, which are primary carrier
photogeneration and following carrier transport. There are two steps
in carrier photogeneration.1 Initially,
a Coulombically bound electron–hole (e–h) pair is generated
from an exciton injected by photon absorption. Subsequently, the photogenerated
geminate e–h pair undergoes either charge recombination or
dissociation, generating free charged carrier on a potential formed
by the binding Coulomb field and an external electric field (E). The carrier transport is basically the diffusion and
drift motions of the free carrier under the effective E field.2 In this carrier transport, the
free carrier possibly encounters another carrier, a trap, an impurity,
or an exciton and then forms various nongeminate pairs, which can
act as important precursor for annihilation of the free carrier. Hence,
pair dynamics is a key elementary process in both carrier generation
and transport. The measurement of the magnetophotoconductance (MPC)
effect originated from the interplay between the spin conservative
recombination and intersystem crossing (isc) of the pair, as illustrated
in Figure 1a, allows
to study the e–h pair dynamics because the isc is influenced
by the external magnetic field (B).3−5

Figure 1 (a)
Elementary kinetics in the e–h pair mechanism for the
MPC effect in an organic semiconductor and (b) structure of a one-dimensional
assembly consisting of stacked HBC-C14 disks.

Hexabenzocoronene attached with six tetradecyl chains (HBC-C14,
see Figure 1b) organizes
highly ordered columnar assembly because of the strong π–π
interactions between the aromatic cores.6−10 Because of this unique nanostructure, HBC-C14 shows one-dimensional
photoconductivity, with high hole mobility.11 To effectively use the promising HBC-C14 for electronic devices,12 it is required to clarify further the mechanism
of photoconduction in the one-dimensional molecular assembly. In this
article, therefore, we studied photoconduction of the HBC-C14 assembly
by means of time-resolved measurement of the MPC effect, which enables
the separation of carrier generation and transport in the time domain.
We will show thermal activation processes in the e–h pair dynamics
in both carrier generation and transport on the basis of temperature
dependence of the MPC effect in the early and later delay times. Kinetic
analysis of the observed temperature dependencies presents an equilibrium
between the short and long-distance e–h pairs in carrier generation
and a narrow distribution for density of the shallow localized states
in carrier transport.

2 Results
Figure 2a shows
a typical transient photocharge (Q) signal for HBC-C14
columnar objects observed under excitation by a laser, with a wavelength
(λ) of 355 nm, at a temperature (T) of 200
K. The Q signal is detected immediately after the
laser pulse and then increased slowly with the delay time after laser
flash (t). The prompt signal of the photocharge (Qp) is proportional to the initial quantity of
the photocarrier born from the geminate e–h pair. The delayed
component after the flash (Qd) arises
from drift motion of the free carrier under an E field,
corresponding to the carrier transport. The saturation behavior of Qd with the delay time reflects elimination of
the free carriers, such as trapping, nongeminate recombination, and
so on. The action spectrum of Qp agrees
with the optical absorption spectrum, of which the peaks at 2.96 eV
are characteristic of the HBC-C14 columnar assembly.13,14 This fact indicates carrier generation from the singlet excitons
in the HBC-C14 column. Figure 2b depicts transient MPC of the HBC-C14 column detected at B = 50 mT. The observed MPC effect, which is defined by
MPC(B, t) = [Q(B, t) – Q(0, t)] × 100/Q(0, t)
as a function of B and t, appeared
in a negative phase in the early times. After the time when MPC reaches
a negative maximum, the effect grows up in a positive direction and
changes its phase from negative to positive at t =
1.4 μs. The negative fast component is caused by the geminate
singlet e–h (1e–h) pair born from the singlet
exciton (1ex).3,15 The isc from 1e–h to the triplet e–h (3e–h) pair
occurs quickly in the absence of B, as illustrated
in Figure 1a. Although
the 1,3e–h pairs of HBC-C14 respectively recombine
to the ground singlet state (1gr) and the triplet exciton
(3ex) according to the spin conservation rule, the rate
for singlet recombination is faster than that for the triplet one.
On the other hand, because the Zeeman interaction that partially solves
the degeneracy among the spin sublevels of the e–h pair suppresses
the isc rate, the recombination efficiency of the e–h pair
increases in the presence of B, resulting in the
negative MPC effect due to decrease of charge-carrier density. The
origin of the positive slow component is assigned to the nongeminate
e–h pair because the nongeminate pair can be formed even at
later times and the population of the 3e–h pair
is statistically higher than that of 1e–h pair.
The positive phase arises from the carrier density enhanced by dissociation
from the highest and lowest Zeeman spin sublevels of the 3e–h pair under the external B field.

Figure 2 Time profiles
of the photocharge (a) and the MPC effect at B =
50 mT (b) for HBC-C14 self-assembly film observed by
photoexcitation at λ = 355 nm under T = 200
K and E = 2.0 × 105 V/cm. Inset of
a is optical absorption (black) and Qp-detected excitation spectra (red) of the HBC-C14 self-assembly measured
at 298 K.

Figure 3a shows
temperature dependence of the photocharge observed in excitation at
λ = 355 nm. With decrease in T, the Qp intensity decreases and the growth speed of Qd becomes slow, indicating, respectively, decrease
of the carrier photogeneration efficiency and deceleration of the
drift motion in low temperatures. In a semilog plot of the photocharge
versus the reciprocal of temperature, the so-called Arrhenius plot
of the photocharge (Figure 3b) shows a linear relationship, in which the slope changes
by 1 order of magnitude at a critical temperature (Tc) of ca. 90 K. Therefore, the temperature region can
be divided into high and low T regimes at Tc, in which the apparent thermal activation
energies are, respectively, estimated to be ΔEHT ∼ 15 meV and ΔELT ∼ 1.5 meV. The slope in the low T regime
mostly remains constant at any delay time, whereas that in the high T regime varies in the time region when the free carrier
transports along the E field. The different time
behaviors of the slope indicate that the activation energy in the
low T regime is relevant to a thermal process in
carrier generation and that in the high T regime
comes from another thermal activation in the carrier transport.

dependence of the photocharge and (b) inverse temperature
dependence of the logarithm of the photocharge observed by photoexcitation
at λ = 355 nm under E = 2.0 × 105 V/cm. The plots in b were normalized at T = 70
K for ease of comparison of the slopes. The black curves in a and
b are simulations calculated by the kinetic analysis considering the
thermal activation processes for carrier transport and generation,
respectively (see text).

We measured temperature dependence of the MPC effect at B = 50 mT, which is much larger than that of the hyperfine
interactions causing the coherent isc between the 1,3e–h
pairs (see Figure S1) in organic semiconductor.
As shown in Figure 4a, the prompt negative MPC due to the geminate e–h pair just
after laser excitation appears in both the high and low T regimes, whereas the obvious positive MPC due to the nongeminate
pair at later times is detected only in the high T regime. Temperature dependencies of the MPCs at early (t = 200 ns) and late (t = 3 μs) times are depicted
in Figure 4b. The negative
MPC at 200 ns, which is almost a purely negative effect of the geminate
pair mechanism, decreases with decreasing T. The
subtraction of MPCs at 200 ns from those at 3 μs (ΔMPC),
which reflects a positive effect only for the nongeminate pair mechanism,
also decreases by lowering T. The observed temperature
dependencies of the geminate and nongeminate MPC effects, respectively,
indicate thermal activation processes in carrier generation and transport.

simulation curves based on carrier generation, including the thermal
process with activation energy of 7 meV (see text).

The relative dissociation efficiency of the geminate
e–h
pair (ϕdr) that was obtained by Qp/E drastically increased with
increasing E (see Figure S2), which was interpreted in terms of deformation of the Coulomb potential
between e and h of the geminate pair by the applied external E field. Slope of the observed electric field effect decreased
with decreasing T. The Onsager theory, considering
the potential deformation by the E field,16−18 simulates the electric field effect observed at room temperature,
but the temperature dependence predicted by the same theory does not
agree with the observed one. The deviation from the theory, in which
an infinite recombination is taken into account, strongly implies
a temperature-dependent recombination rate of the geminate e–h
pair in carrier generation.19−21

3 Discussion
3.1 Carrier Generation
The QP intensity of the HBC-C14 assembly slightly increased
with increasing T in the low T regime,
manifesting a small activation energy for dissociation from the geminate
e–h pair in the carrier generation, which is not interpreted
by the Onsager theory. To the best of our knowledge, a hopping dissociation
explains the activated behavior in a random organic system,22 but there is no good model for the organized
system. The MPC, due to geminate recombination in the HBC-C14 assembly,
negatively increased with increasing T, indicating
that the same activation is also relevant to the B field-dependent isc of the geminate e–h pair. To understand
the observed thermal activation of both dissociation and isc, we discuss
about the geminate pair dynamics, with a model including two types
of e–h pairs: one is a short distance pair (e–hr) that is a precursor for the recombination, with a rate constant
of kr, and another is a long-distance
pair (e–hd) from which the dissociation takes place,
with a rate constant of kd, as illustrated
in Figure 5. The e–hd is assumed to be located on top of the geminate pair potential,
which is formed in a balance between the Coulomb interaction and external E field. The energy gap between these pairs (ΔEg) is the origin for activation energy in carrier
generation. Separation from e–hr to e–hd (kup) requires extra energy of
ΔEg, but approach (kdn) and dissociation (kd)
of the e–hd need no activation energy. Not only
the Coulomb interaction but also the exchange interaction (J), which rapidly increases with decreasing separation distance
(r), seriously influences the potential of short
distance pair. Hence, a large J value of the e–hr splits the potential into the singlet (S) and triplet (T)
states.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic diagram of the e–h pair dynamics in carrier
generation. The red curve is the potential energy due to Coulomb interaction
and the external E field. (b) Effective rate constants
for the spin-selective geminate recombination obtained from the simulations
of the temperature dependencies of QP (Figure 3) and MPC (Figure 4).

Rate equations of the geminate e–h pairs
are written as 1  ne-h and kup0 are, respectively,
number density of the e–h pair and the prefactor of the separation
rate constant of e–hr following from the Arrhenius
law. kB is the Boltzmann constant. Because
coherent S–T mixing among the degenerate spin states of the
e–h pair is effective due to the hyperfine interaction (Ahf), isc does not occur in e–hr. When B as much greater than Ahf is applied, the isc only between the S and T0 states of the e–hd is allowed because of large
energy shifts of the T± states due to the Zeeman interaction.
The observed MPC is caused by the combination of this magnetic field-dependent
isc of e–hd and the spin conservative recombination
(krS ≠ krT) of e–hr, which recombines
into 1gr or the 3ex. We take the magnetic field-dependent
isc and the spin-selective recombination in the rate equations above
(eq 1). By employing
a steady-state approximation on e–hr under an initial
condition that 1ex generates e–hd quickly,
the effective recombination rate constants from e–hr (kreffi)
are reduced as 2  kreff is proportional
to the recombination yield of the e–hr pair (ϕri), which involves the thermally
activated separation of e–hd from e–hr (kup). Eq 1 in two extreme cases can be consequently
rewritten as 3a  at B = 0 and 3b  at B ≫ Ahf. To interpret
the time profile and temperature dependence
of Q, we calculate the total density of free carriers
(nfc) that have escaped from e–hd 4  The analytical expression of nfc(t) under an initial condition of ne-hdS = n0 and ne-hdT = 0 is described in the literature.10 We also calculate MPC due to the geminate pair using the formula  5  to explain the temperature dependence of negative
MPC of the geminate pair mechanism.

We carried out the simulations
for both temperature dependence
of the QP below Tc and the MPC of the geminate pair mechanism to obtain a unique
set of rate constants. Because kisc (6.4
× 107 s–1), kd (6.0 × 107 s–1), and the
ratio of kreffS/kreffT (1.0:0.8) at 298 K have been already
estimated in the literature,10 there are
three free parameters kdn, kup0/kr, and ΔEg for the simulation. The black solid lines
in Figures 3b and 4b are the best simulations that are respectively
calculated with eqs 4 and 5. These simulations well reproduce the
experimental results, and the estimated kreff constants are shown in Figure 5b. The observed decrease of |MPC| as lowering of T is qualitatively understood by a trend of the e–h
pair equilibrium toward low-lying e–hr, which has
no magnetic field-dependent isc because of the large S–T energy
gap. Also the phase and size of MPC are sensitive to the ratio of kreffS/kreffT. The negative phase of MPC appears only under the condition
of kreffS > kreffT. Hence, it can be said that the reduction
of the difference between kreffS and kreffT in the low T regime of Figure 5b is the cause for the decrease of |MPC| at low temperatures.
Quantitatively lowering T makes kup in eq 2 small, which equalizes kreffS and kreffT. The ΔEg estimated from the simulations is 7 meV, which
is smaller than that of poly(para-phenylene) film
(18–26 meV) obtained from temperature dependence of the magnetoluminescence
effect at zero electric field23 because
the potential barrier of the e–h pair becomes small in presence
of the E field. This reasonable agreement of ΔEg in carrier generation of the organic solid
thus speaks for the validity of the model on the basis of the equilibrium
between the e–hr and e–hd pairs.

3.2 Carrier Transport
The temperature
dependencies of Qd and MPC in the later
times indicate that there is also the thermal activation process in
carrier transport. Therefore, we discuss carrier transport in the
self-assembly of HBC-C14 using the multiple trapping model (Figure 6a), which includes
both the band conduction in ordered domains and hopping conduction
in regions with no long-range order.24−26 Thus, there is trapping/detrapping
dynamics and nongeminate recombination. The carriers above the mobility
edge, called as the free carriers, transport along the E field and they also may be captured into the localized states in
the band gap during the transport. The carriers in the localized states,
that is, the trapped carriers, do not move until detrapping to the
mobility edge using the thermal energy of kBT, which can be the origin for the thermal activation
process observed in the carrier transport. Because the carrier detrapping
hardly takes place if the energy depth of the localized state (ε)
is deeper than that of kBT, carrier trappings into the deep-localized states eliminate the
free carriers. On the other hand, the free carriers can form the nongeminate
e–h pairs by statistical encounters with other free carriers
having opposite charge and then can disappear by nongeminate recombination.
According to such carrier dynamics in the multiple trapping model,
the rate equation for the free carrier density (nfc) is written as 6  The first- (k1) and second-order (k2) rate constants
arise from carrier trapping into the deep-localized state and nongeminate
recombination, respectively. To convert the solution of eq 6 to time evolution of the Qd signal, one must perform time integration
of nfc (see Section S3 in Supporting Information for details of the derivation).
Because the total Q signal consists of not only Qd but also Qp, the
final analytical form for the time profile is 7a   7b  n0, q, μ, and S represent initial densities of
the free carriers, the elementary charge, drift mobility, and cross
section of the carrier transport way, respectively. As shown in Figure 3a, eq 7a reproduced the observed time profiles
of Q very well. The k1 and k2n0 constants optimized in the simulation at each temperature are plotted
in Figure 6b. These
rate constants are comparable to each other in the low T regime. In the high T regime, k1 drops substantially but k2n0 increases with increasing T. Because carrier trapping is determined by a magnitude
relation between kBT and
ε, the sudden drop of k1 above the
critical temperature suggests that Tc reflects
a depth for majority of the localized states.

model for the carrier transport. The localized
states in the band gap are divided into shallow and deep states according
to ε, with the reference of kBT. (b) Temperature dependencies of the carrier elimination
rate constants of k1 (blue) and k2n0 (red) estimated
by fitting the time profiles of Q signal, depicted
in Figure 3a. The solid

model, with an energy distribution for density of localized states.
The red broken line is calculated using an Arrhenius rate constant
for k2. (c) Gaussian distribution for
density of the localized states optimized by fitting the temperature
dependences in b.

In the multiple trapping
model, as described in Section S3, the
carrier trapping and recombination rates depend
on not only T but also the density of the localized
states g(ε). To calculate the temperature dependencies
of k1 and k2, we adapted a Gaussian distribution, g 8  Nt is the total
number of the localized states. As represented in Figure 6b, the calculation using eq S9 reproduced the temperature dependence of k1 but did not duplicate well that of k2n0. The fit of
the calculation of k2n0 with the observed one is improved by employing an Arrhenius
type of recombination rate constant, βn0 = β0ϕadj exp(−ΔEngr/kBT) into eq S9b. Here, ϕadj is the temperature dependence of the dimensionless carrier generation
efficiency estimated from the prompt MPC in Figure 4b for taking into account the temperature
effect on n0. The shape of g and the parameters determined by the simulations are, respectively,
shown in Figure 6c
and Table 1.

10.1	3.3	2.1	18.9	
Depth at the distribution
peak (ε0) of the HBC-C14
assembly is estimated to be 10.1 meV, which is slightly larger than
that of the thermal energy at Tc of 90
K and is shallower than that for randomly oriented films consisting
of polymers (350–400 meV)27 or small
molecules (190–400 meV)28,29 and for blend films
of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (87 meV).30 The estimated distribution width (σε) of 3.3 meV for the HBC-C14 assembly is narrower than
that of the polymers (200–500 meV)27 and small molecules (100–150 meV)28,29 and the blend film of P3HT/PC61BM (29 meV).30 The organized structure of HBC-C14 in the one-dimensional
assembly is the main reason for such shallow depth and narrow distribution.
Because in the high T regime most of the delocalized
states behave as shallow traps, nfc efficiently
increases with increasing T. On the other hand, the
thermal activation of ΔEngr = 18.9
meV obviously indicates that the increase of the nongeminate recombination
rate as a bimolecular reaction in high temperatures is due to the
increase of not only nfc but also k2. ΔEngr is
comparable to the apparent activation energy ΔEHT in the high T regime. The presence
of activation energy in the nongeminate recombination rate constant
is interpreted in terms of the Langevin bimolecular recombination,
in which the rate factor is a function of the drift mobility activated
by thermal energy.31

4 Conclusions
Using the time-resolved MPC technique, we examined
the temperature
dependence of carrier generation and transport in the low-dimensional
molecular assembly of HBC-C14. The Arrhenius analysis of Q and MPC turned out to show a small activation energy for the carrier
generation and a large one for carrier transport. The carrier generation
is basically interpreted in terms of competing kinetics between the
recombination and dissociation of the geminate e–h pair on
the singlet and triplet Coulomb potentials distorted by the applied E field. An equilibrium dynamics between the short- and
long-distance e–h pairs has been clarified. For carrier transport,
on the other hand, the observed thermal activation of the transient Q signal was understood by the multiple trapping model taking
account of both the unimolecular decay of carriers due to the trapping
and Langevin bimolecular recombination. It has been elucidated that
the HBC-C14 assembly has a narrow energy distribution of the shallow
localized states, which is an important advantage of the ordered molecular
system.

5 Experimental Section
HBC-C14 was synthesized
as reported previously.32,33 The film of the fiber
assembly of the HBC-C14 columns was prepared
on quartz glass plates coated with comb-shaped indium tin oxide electrodes,
with a gap of 5.0 μm by a drop cast method, using dichloromethane
solution34 (see Figure S3). The film sample on the glass plate was encapsulated with
a cover glass plate to avoid exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Details
of the setup for time-resolved MPC measurement in Q-mode are described in the literature.35 The transient Q signal induced by irradiation using
nanosecond lasers was measured using an RC circuit
comprising the sample device, with a capacitance (C) of ca. 150 pF, a resistance (R) of 1.0 MΩ,
and a variable DC power supply. The voltage generated between both
ends of the R, which is induced by the drift of photocarriers
and corresponds to Q/C, was monitored
as a function of the delay time after laser flash. A static B field was applied to a film fixed in the center of an
electromagnet to observe the MPC effect. Temperature of the sample
was controlled by a He flow cryostat equipped with quartz windows
for light irradiation (Optistat CF, Oxford Instruments).
