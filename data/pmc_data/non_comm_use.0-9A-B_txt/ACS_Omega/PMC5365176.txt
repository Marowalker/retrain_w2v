A number
of lysine-specific methyltransferases (KMTs) are responsible
for the post-translational modification of cellular proteins on lysine
residues. Most KMTs typically recognize specific motifs in unstructured,
short peptide sequences. However, we have recently discovered a novel
KMT that appeared to have a more relaxed sequence specificity, namely,
valosin-containing protein (VCP)-KMT, which trimethylates Lys-315
in the molecular chaperone VCP. On the basis of this, here, we explored
the possibility of using the VCP-KMT/VCP system to obtain specific
lysine methylation of desired sequences grafted onto a VCP-derived
scaffold. We generated VCP-derived proteins in which three amino acid
residues on each side of Lys-315 had been replaced by various sequences
representing lysine methylation sites in histone H3. We found that
all of these chimeric proteins were subject to efficient VCP-KMT-mediated
methylation in vitro, and methylation was also observed in mammalian
cells. Thus, we here describe a versatile system for introducing lysine
methylation into a desired peptide sequence, and the approach should
be readily expandable for generating combinatorial libraries of methylated
sequences.

Introduction
Cellular proteins are
frequently post-translationally modified
by methylation, mainly on the side chain of arginine and lysine residues.1,2 A lysine residue can accept up to three methyl groups, leading to
four possible states: mono-, di-, tri- (me1, me2, me3), and unmethylated
(me0) forms. Lysine methylation has been most extensively studied
in the case of histone proteins, and histone lysine methylation has
been established as an important regulator of gene expression and
chromatin state.3 In histone proteins,
the methylated lysines are mainly found in the unstructured N-terminal
tails and are read by specific reader domains, which typically constitute
parts of multidomain proteins that can modify and/or remodel chromatin.4 In general, some of the histone methylations
represent signals for gene activation and loosening of the chromatin
structure, whereas others signal gene repression and heterochromatin
formation. In histone H3, for example, trimethylated Lys-9 acts like
a repressive mark, whereas trimethylation at Lys-4 is associated with
gene activation.3 Importantly, methylated
lysines are also found in a number of nonhistone proteins; however,
for the majority of these, their functional significance as well as
the enzyme introducing the methylation remains elusive.2,5

Protein lysine methylation is catalyzed by a number of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent lysine (K)-specific methyltransferases (KMTs), which belong to two structurally distinct methyltransferase
(MTase) classes, namely, the seven-β-strand (7BS) MTases and
the SET domain MTases.6−8 The SET domain MTase family, named after its three
founding members (Su(var)-39, E(z), and Trithorax), appears to consist
exclusively of KMTs, and these enzymes mainly recognize specific motifs
in unstructured, short peptide sequences, such as the flexible N-terminal
tails of histone proteins.7 In contrast,
the 7BS MTases act on a wide range of substrates, including small
metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins; however, recently, a number
of novel human KMTs belonging to this group have been discovered.6 The 7BS KMTs appear to mainly target nonhistone
proteins and bind their substrates not primarily through the linear
sequence surrounding the methylation site, but rather in a manner
involving multiple interactions with the folded substrate protein.
This has been studied in detail for the 7BS KMT VCP-KMT (METTL21D),
which specifically trimethylates the essential chaperone valosin-containing
protein (VCP) on Lys-315.9,10 It was found that VCP-KMT
interacts strongly with its substrate and a substantial portion of
VCP (amino acids 282–364) was required for the interaction
to occur.10 Moreover, simultaneous mutation
of the amino acids surrounding the methylation site, Lys-315, in VCP
did not negatively affect the efficiency of the VCP-KMT-mediated methylation.10 VCP-KMT appears to be a highly specific enzyme;
two independent studies, using different approaches, identified VCP
as an interaction partner and substrate of VCP-KMT, and no other substrates
have been identified.9,10 Moreover, a comparison of VCP-KMT-mediated
methylation in extracts from wild-type and vcpkmt–/– mice also revealed only a single substrate,
namely, VCP.11

VCP, also known as
p97, is a type II AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities)
ATPase consisting of an N-terminal domain,
two ATPase domains referred to as D1 and D2, and a C-terminal tail.12 VCP forms a homohexameric structure, where the
D1 and D2 domains constitute two stacked rings surrounding a central
channel.12 The site of VCP-KMT-mediated
methylation is found within this channel, and accordingly, VCP is
not susceptible to methylation by VCP-KMT when present in the hexameric
state, suggesting that methylation occurs before hexamer assembly.10 VCP is a highly abundant protein present in
both eukaryotes and archaea, where it functions as a ubiquitin-specific
protein chaperone mediating protein unfolding and disassembly of protein
complexes, and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes,
including protein degradation, membrane dynamics, and cell-cycle regulation.12

On the basis of the observation that VCP-KMT-mediated
methylation
of VCP is apparently rather insensitive to alterations in the sequence
surrounding the methylation site, we sought to explore the possibility
that short, lysine-containing sequences of choice may be amenable
to VCP-KMT-mediated methylation when grafted onto a VCP-derived scaffold.
We reasoned that, if successful, such a strategy may allow VCP-KMT-mediated
methylation of desired peptide sequences both in vitro and in vivo
and may also be utilized for the generation of combinatorial libraries
of lysine-methylated proteins. We have therefore, in the present study,
generated VCP-derived proteins, where three amino acid residues on
each side of the original methylation site (Lys-315) have been replaced
by the corresponding sequence from various lysine methylation sites
in human histone H3, such as Lys-4, Lys-9, Lys-27, and Lys-36. We
demonstrate that the resulting VCP/H3 chimeras are efficiently methylated
by VCP-KMT in vitro and also subject to methylation by endogenous
cellular VCP-KMT when expressed in mammalian cells.

Results
Determining
the Minimal (Lys-315-Encompassing) Part of VCP Required
for Efficient Expression and Purification
We previously found
that VCP was not amenable to VCP-KMT-mediated methylation when present
in its naturally occurring homohexameric state. However, a truncated
version of VCP, which lacked the D2 domain (VCPΔD2) (Figure 1A,B) and was unable
to form a stable VCP homohexamer, was efficiently methylated.10 Moreover, results from a yeast two-hybrid screen
defined a relatively short segment (encompassing residues 282–364),
the so-called selected interaction domain (SID) (Figure 1A,B), as the minimal part of
VCP necessary for interaction with VCP-KMT.10 On the basis of this and for the purpose of generating VCP/peptide
chimeras, we set out to define a smallest possible VCP-derived segment
that could be efficiently methylated by VCP-KMT and readily be expressed
and purified as a recombinant protein. Thus, we generated several
constructs encoding N-terminally hexahistidine (6xHis)-tagged, VCP-derived
proteins for expression in Escherichia coli. The smallest of these encompassed only the SID (slightly expanded
to encompass residues 278–371, thereby avoiding the disruption
of secondary structure elements). We also designed a somewhat larger
protein, denoted SID+, which encompassed the entire structural subdomain
in which the SID resides (residues 207–371). A third construct
encompassed the entire D1 ATPase domain of VCP (residues 201–463).
The three constructs as well as the previously investigated VCPΔD2
protein were expressed in the BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL strain of E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.
The D1 and VCPΔD2 proteins were expressed at high levels and
gave good yields after purification by affinity chromatography, whereas
the SID+ and SID proteins were poorly expressed, gave low yield and
purity, and were not detected by Coomassie gel staining after purification
(Figure 1C).

VCP-KMT-Mediated Methylation of VCP Deletion
Mutants
Next, the purified recombinant proteins were tested
as substrates
for VCP-KMT in an in vitro methylation reaction in the presence of
[3H]AdoMet, and we observed by fluorography that D1 and
VCPΔD2 were strongly methylated (Figure 2A). Despite our inability to visually detect
the corresponding recombinant proteins after purification, we tested
the preparations of SID and SID+ proteins as substrates for methylation.
Interestingly, the preparation of the SID+ protein showed methylation
of a band corresponding to its predicted molecular weight, whereas
no methylation was detected in the preparation of the SID protein
(Figure 2A). To better
quantify the extent of methylation, we performed an experiment where
the D1 and VCPΔD2 proteins were subjected to in vitro methylation
by varying the concentrations of VCP-KMT in the presence of [3H]AdoMet, followed by scintillation counting of radioactivity
incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable material.
The results showed virtually identical VCP-KMT titration curves for
D1 and VCPΔD2 (Figure 2B). In conclusion, the above experiments indicate that the
SID+ protein can be methylated by VCP-KMT, but suggested D1, which
was readily purified and efficiently methylated as the best starting
point for generating VCP-derived peptide chimeras.

previous observations.10 (B) Titration

VCP-KMT-Mediated Methylation
of VCP-D1-Derived Chimeras
We previously found that VCP-KMT
efficiently methylated Lys-315 in
VCP even after individual or simultaneous mutation to alanine of the
six residues surrounding the methylation site (amino acids 312–314
and 316–318),10 and we therefore
reasoned that these neighboring residues are not crucial for the interaction
of VCP with VCP-KMT. Moreover, the methylation site and the surrounding
residues are localized within a loop in the VCP structure (Figure 3A), indicating that
the replacement of these surrounding residues is unlikely to disrupt
secondary structure elements and may generally be tolerated with respect
to VCP-KMT-mediated methylation. To test this, we replaced these amino
acids in the D1 domain with the corresponding sequence derived from
several lysine methylation sites in histone H3, thereby generating
D1/H3 chimeras where the seven amino acid segment containing Lys-315
and surrounding residues had been replaced by the H3-derived sequence.
We generated chimeric proteins representing the methylation sites
Lys-4, Lys-9, Lys-27, and Lys-36 in H3, denoted D1-H3K4, D1-H3K9,
D1-H3K27, and D1-H3K36, respectively (Figure 3B), and these proteins were efficiently expressed
and purified from E. coli (Figure 3C). Next, we investigated
whether the generated recombinant D1/H3 chimeras could be methylated
by VCP-KMT in vitro, as assessed by the incorporation of radioactivity
from [3H]AdoMet. Clearly, all four chimeras (D1-H3K4, D1-H3K9,
D1-H3K27, and D1-H3K36) showed strong methylation, as analyzed by
fluorography (Figure 3D). To obtain a more quantitative measure of methylation efficiency,
the chimeras were methylated in vitro in the presence of varying amounts
of VCP-KMT, and the methylation was measured by scintillation counting
of the TCA-precipitable material. In these experiments, the D1-H3K4
and D1-H3K36 proteins as well as wild-type D1 gave similar titration
curves, reaching an apparent plateau at high enzyme concentrations
(Figure 3E). This indicated,
on the basis of our previous work with VCP-KMT,10 that close to complete trimethylation was achieved. In
contrast, the D1-H3K9 and D1-H3K27 chimeras were less efficiently
methylated, and a substantially higher amount of enzyme (approximately
3-fold) was required to obtain a similar level of methylation (Figure 3E). Thus, these experiments
demonstrated that all of the four D1/H3 chimeras could be methylated
in vitro by VCP-KMT, but that the D1-H3K9 and D1-H3K27 proteins were
somewhat poorer substrates than the wild-type D1 protein.

Cellular Methylation of D1/H3 Chimeras
Next, we set
out to investigate whether the constructed chimeric proteins could
undergo VCP-KMT-mediated methylation also inside cells. To this end,
we generated stably transfected, HEK293-derived cell lines that expressed,
from a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoter, D1 or the D1/H3 chimeras
with an added tag for tandem affinity purification (TAP). Utilizing
the streptavidin-binding protein (SBP) portion of the TAP-tag, we
purified these proteins from the corresponding doxycycline-induced
cells by affinity chromatography using streptavidin-coated beads.
Unfortunately, we were unable to generate a cell line for the expression
of the D1-H3K27 chimera. However, the remaining three chimeras (D1-H3K4,
D1-H3K9, and D1-H3K36) as well as the wild-type D1 protein could be
successfully purified from the corresponding cell lines (Figure 4A). To assess the
methylation status of the purified chimeric proteins, peptidase chymotrypsin
was used to produce peptides encompassing the methylation site, and
these peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC−MS/MS) analysis. Chymotrypsin preferentially
cleaves C-terminal to the bulky hydrophobic residues, Phe, Trp, Tyr,
Leu, and Met; however, the cleavage varies greatly depending on the
sequence context, usually resulting in missed cleavage sites.13 For the wild-type D1 protein as well as the
D1-H3K4 and D1-H3K9 chimeras, we primarily detected a Lys-315-encompassing
peptide of 27 amino acids containing two missed Leu cleavage sites,
whereas for the D1-H3K36 chimera, we primarily detected a 26-mer peptide
containing one missed cleavage site. Peptide sequencing by MS/MS confirmed
the presence of a methylated lysine at the position corresponding
to Lys-315 in all three chimeras as well as in the wild-type D1 protein
(Figures S1–S4). To semiquantitatively
assess the methylation statuses of the chimeras, extracted-ion chromatograms
corresponding to the atomic mass of the 26-mer (D1-H3K36) or 27-mer
(remaining proteins) chymotryptic peptides in the four possible methylation
states (me0, me1, me2, and me3) were generated (Figure S5), and the area under the relevant peaks was used
to determine the methylation status (Figure 4B). Whereas the wild-type D1 protein was
found primarily in the trimethylated state, the chimeras showed lower
methylation levels, ranging from very little methylation in the case
of D1-H3K9 (∼15% monomethylation) to an average of ∼0.9
and ∼1.7 methyl groups per molecule in the case of D1-H3K4
and D1-H3K36, respectively. These results agree reasonably well with
those from the experiments where recombinant, E. coli-expressed chimeras were subjected to VCP-KMT-mediated methylation
in vitro (Figure 3D,E)
and where the D1-H3K9 protein was shown to be less efficiently methylated
than D1-H3K4 and D1-H3K36. To assess the purified TAP-tagged chimeras
for their susceptibility to VCP-KMT-mediated methylation, they were
incubated with VCP-KMT in the presence of [3H]AdoMet, and
the methylation was analyzed by fluorography. The results were basically
in agreement with those obtained in previous experiments, that is,
D1-H3K9 was less efficiently methylated than the two other chimeras
(D1-H3K4 and D1-H3K36) (Figure 4C). Notably, the TAP-tagged wild-type D1 protein (expressed
and purified from mammalian cells) was a relatively poor substrate
for VCP-KMT-mediated methylation in vitro likely because it was in
an almost completely trimethylated state. Taken together, the above
results demonstrate that the D1/H3 chimeras, when expressed in mammalian
cells, become methylated on Lys-315, although the methylation level
was lower than that observed for the wild-type D1 domain. On another
note, we considered the possibility that chromatin reader proteins
that bind to specific methylated histone sequences may also bind to
their cognate target sequences when these are present within a D1/H3
chimera. However, by visual inspection of a silver-stained electrophoresis
gel containing the TAP-tagged chimera and co-purifying proteins (Figure 4A), we were unable
to identify any protein that is bound preferentially to a specific
chimeric protein.

Discussion
In
this study, we generated four chimeric proteins on the basis
of the D1 domain of VCP, where residues surrounding the methylation
site, Lys-315, have been replaced by the corresponding sequence from
various lysine methylation sites found in histone H3. All four chimeras
could be methylated to almost full trimethylation at Lys-315 by VCP-KMT
in vitro, and the methylation of chimeras expressed in cells was also
observed, albeit at lower efficiency. These results further demonstrate
that VCP-KMT-mediated methylation of VCP is rather insensitive to
alterations of the sequence surrounding the methylation site and indicate
that VCP-KMT and the VCP-D1 domain together constitute a system that
can be used for introducing lysine methylation into a sequence of
choice, both in vitro or in vivo, and generating combinatorial libraries
of lysine-methylated proteins.

VCP-KMT belongs to a recently
discovered family of related 7BS
KMTs, denoted MTF16. Several other human family members, for example,
METTL21A (HSPA-KMT), METTL22 (KIN-KMT), and calmodulin (CaM) KMT,
also methylate lysines that, similarly to Lys-315 in VCP, are localized
to loops in proteins.9,14,15 We may therefore envision that some of these other enzymes may also
show a high degree of tolerance for the replacement of residues in
the vicinity of the methylation site and thus may be used to methylate
the desired peptide sequences, as has been described here. However,
only in the case of CaM-KMT has the effect of systematically mutating
residues in the vicinity of the methylation site been investigated,
and the methylation was actually abrogated by individual mutation
of several residues near the methylation site, Lys-115.16 Another human MTF16 family member, METTL20,
targets two neighboring lysine residues (Lys-200 and Lys-203) in the
β-subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFβ), localized
in the lysine-rich sequence, Lys200-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys205, found as part of an α-helix.17,18 It was shown that the lysines in this motif that are not sites of
methylation (Lys-202, Lys-204, Lys-205) could be simultaneously mutated
to arginine without affecting methylation, and, in addition, the methylation
targets Lys-200 and Lys-203 could be individually replaced by arginine
without abolishing methylation at the other site (Lys-203 and Lys-200,
respectively).17 This shows that also METTL20
is somewhat tolerant to substitutions of residues in the vicinity
of the methylation sites, and it will be interesting to investigate
whether this is also the case for other 7BS KMTs belonging to MTF16.

Actually, an approach slightly similar to that described here has
been reported for the related enzyme, CaM-KMT, and its substrate,
calmodulin.19 However, mutation of residues
surrounding the methylation site in calmodulin abrogates CaM-KMT-mediated
methylation (as mentioned above), and, in the relevant study, it was
merely tested whether the CaM-KMT-mediated methylation would still
occur after the replacement of sequence segments found in a flexible
linker region of calmodulin (residues 68–92), localized distant
to the actual methylation site, Lys-115.19 Methylation was still observed after relative conservative replacements
(of polar residues with polar residues and nonpolar residues with
nonpolar residues) of sequence in the linker region, indicating that
the CaM/CaM-KMT system may be used to generate libraries of methylated
proteins, but where the actual methylation site is localized distant
to the sequence that is varied.19 Compared
with the CaM-KMT/CaM system, the VCP-KMT/D1 system described here
has a major and obvious advantage that the varied sequence actually
surrounds the methylation site.

We achieved a rather efficient
methylation of the D1/H3 chimeras
by VCP-KMT in vitro, that is, the level of methylation obtained at
the highest enzyme concentration was similar to that obtained with
the wild-type domain, reflecting a close to full trimethylation. In
contrast, the chimeras were methylated to a much lower occupancy inside
cells. This may partly be explained by the chimeras being poorer VCP-KMT
substrates per se, as observed in the in vitro experiments; however,
it could also be that the chimeras are more prone to aggregation and/or
have higher turnover rates or that they interact with endogenous full-length
VCP in manners that interfere with methylation. Possibly, overexpression
of VCP-KMT, which is normally expressed at very low levels, may increase
the methylation of the D1/H3 chimeras in cells.

Several other
methods for the site-specific introduction of methylated
lysine residues into recombinant proteins have been reported. Methylated
recombinant histone proteins have been generated by native chemical
ligation of synthetic methylated peptide thioesters corresponding
to histone N-termini to histone C-terminal globular domains containing
an engineered N-terminal cysteine residue.20,21 Also, genetically modified E. coli strains have been constructed, which allow site-specific incorporation
of noncanonical amino acids, such as pyrrolysine or phosphoserine,
into recombinant proteins, and methylated lysines can subsequently
be formed by specific chemical derivatization of the unnatural amino
acid.22,23 Compared with most of the other methods,
the current method has the advantage that no chemical transformation
is involved and can, therefore, be used for lysine methylation also
inside cells (not only in vitro). However, one obvious drawback of
the current method is that the peptide sequence to be methylated must
be grafted onto the D1 scaffold. It will be an important task for
future studies to investigate how the placement of the relevant peptide
sequences onto the D1 scaffold will affect their ability to engage
in biologically relevant interactions and whether the system described
in the present study can be expanded to sequences longer than seven
amino acid residues.

The phage-display technology has been extensively
used to generate
vast libraries of variants of certain proteins, such as the variable
domains of antibodies.24 Possibly, the
approach described in the present work could be transferred to a phage-display
system, where the D1 domain and variants are expressed on a phage
surface, and lysine methylation could be mediated either by exogenously
added VCP-KMT or by expressing VCP-KMT inside the phage-producing
bacteria. Such a system may have a large potential for defining the
sequence specificity of methyllysine-specific reader proteins.

Materials
and Methods
Cloning and Mutagenesis
Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) was used to amplify a VCP-derived sequence (corresponding
to SID, SID+, and D1) from plasmid pQE9-His-p97deltaD225 using primers that generate PCR products with
flanking restriction sites for cloning into pET-28a for expression
as 6xHis-tagged protein. DNA fragments encoding VCP/H3 chimeras were
generated using PCR SOEing (splicing by overlap extension) and cloned
into pET-28a. The genes encoding the D1 and H3/D1 proteins were PCR-amplified
and cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) plasmid
for mammalian expression of fusion proteins with the calmodulin-binding
peptide (CBP) and the SBP. The sequences encoding the CBP and SBP
tags as well as appropriate restriction enzyme cleavage sites were
included as extensions to the relevant PCR primers. All of the sequences
were verified by DNA sequencing.

Expression and Purification
of His-Tagged Recombinant Proteins
pET-28a-derived plasmids
harboring the genes of interest were transformed
into the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus
(DE3)-RIPL (Agilent Technologies). The transformed cells were confirmed
by colony PCR and then cultured at 37 °C with agitation at 250
rpm until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Then, the incubation
temperature was reduced to 16 °C, protein expression was induced
by 150 μM isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the
cultures were incubated with shaking overnight. The cells were harvested
by centrifugation and lysed with a lysis buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v), 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich)], a complete protease inhibitor
mixture (Roche Applied Sciences), and 25 units/mL Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich)).
Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and
allowed to bind to Ni-NTA matrix (QIAGEN) at 4 °C overnight.
Thereafter, the Ni-NTA matrix was washed three times with a wash buffer
[50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v),
30 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT], and the 6xHis-tagged proteins were
eluted with an elution buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 500
mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v), 500 mM imidazole, and 1 mM DTT). The
eluate was concentrated and buffer-exchanged with a storage buffer
(50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v),
and 1 mM DTT) using Vivaspin 20 ultrafiltration columns with a 10
kDa molecular mass cutoff (SartoriusAG). The protein samples were
aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

MTase Assay
MTase
assays were carried out in 50 μL
volumes at 37 °C for 1 h in MTase buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.8),
50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP] with 10 μg of
protein substrate (17.3 μg of VCPΔD2, corresponding to
the same molar amount as that for D1), 100 pmol VCP-KMT, and 13 μM
[3H] AdoMet (PerkinElmer; specific activity, ≈80
Ci/mmol). The reaction was stopped either by denaturation in NuPAGE
sample buffer for separation on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel, followed by fluorography, or by
precipitating the protein with 10% TCA for scintillation counting
of radioactivity. For fluorography, MTase assay reactions were separated
on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S, dried,
sprayed with scintillation enhancer EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer), and then
exposed to Kodak Biomax MS film (Sigma-Aldrich) at −80 °C.

For liquid scintillation counting, the precipitated reactions were
filtered through Whatman filters and washed three times with 10% TCA,
followed by an ethanol wash. The filters containing acid-insoluble
protein precipitates were then transferred to a vial with scintillation
fluid (Ultima Gold TMXR, PerkinElmer). After a few minutes of incubation,
the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter.

Generation of Stable Cell Lines
Inducible overexpressing
cell lines for D1 and D1/H3 chimeras were generated using the Flp-In
T-REx-293 system (Invitrogen). The pcDNA5/FRT/TO-CBP-SBP-D1/H3 and
pOG44 (Invitrogen) plasmids were co-transfected using the FuGENE6
transfection reagent (Roche) into FlpIn-TReX HEK293 cells, according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells that successfully incorporated
CBP-SBP-D1/H3 into the genome were selected by the addition of 200
μg/mL Hygromycin b (Invitrogen) to the medium and further cultured
in tetracycline-reduced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin, and
streptomycin. The expression of constructs in doxycycline-induced
cells was confirmed by Western blot using the anti-SBP antibodies
(Millipore).

Purification of CBP-SBP-Tagged Proteins
FlpIn-TReX
HEK293 CBP-SBP-H3/D1 stable cell lines were cultured in T175 flasks,
induced with doxycycline (1 μg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) to induce
the expression of the incorporated gene and then further incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the cells were harvested, and CBP–SBP-tagged
proteins were purified using the streptavidin resin from Interplay
Mammalian TAP system (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The purified proteins were supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)
to promote protein stability.

Protein MS
Proteins
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained
with Coomassie, and the portion of the gel containing the protein
of interest was excised and subjected to in-gel chymotrypsin digestion,
followed by analysis of the resulting proteolytic fragments by LC
coupled to MS. Reversed phase (C18) LC was performed using the Dionex
Ultimate 3000 UHPLC systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide
solution (5 μL) was injected into the extraction μ-Precolumn
(Acclaim PepMap100, C18, 5 μm resin, 100 Å, 300 μm
i.d. × 5 mm) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the peptides were
eluted in back-flush mode onto the analytical column (Acclaim PepMap100,
C18, 3 μm resin, 100 Å, 75 μm i.d. × 5 cm, nanoViper)
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile
and MS-grade water, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Chromatographic
separation was achieved by using a binary gradient from 3 to 50% of
acetonitrile in water for 60 min, with a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min.
The LC system was coupled via a nanoelectrospray ion source to a Q
Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Peptide samples were analyzed with a high-energy collisional
dissociation fragmentation method with normalized collision energy
set at 28, acquiring one Orbitrap survey scan in the mass-to-charge
ratio range (m/z) of 300–2000,
followed by MS/MS of the 10 most intense ions in the Orbitrap. MS
data were analyzed with in-house-maintained human sequence databases
using SEQUEST and Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The mass tolerances of a fragment ion and a parent ion were set at
0.5 Da and 10 ppm, respectively. Methionine oxidation and cysteine
carbamidomethylation were selected as variable modifications. MS/MS
spectra of peptides corresponding to methylated D1/H3 chimeras were
manually searched by Qual Browser (v2.0.7). Ion chromatograms corresponding
to the different methylated forms of the D1 protein and the corresponding
D1/H3 chimeras were generated and analyzed using Xcalibur Qual Browser
(v2.0.7) by gating for relevant mass-to-charge ratios of the 26-mer
or 27-mer chymotrypsine-generated peptide, corresponding to Ile303–Leu328
or Ile303–Leu329, respectively, in VCP. The relative abundance
of the different methylated species of each chimera was approximated
as the ratio of the area under the relevant chromatographic peak (e.g.,
MeO, Me1, Me2, or Me3) to the sum of the areas under all peaks (MeO,
Me1, Me2, and Me3).
