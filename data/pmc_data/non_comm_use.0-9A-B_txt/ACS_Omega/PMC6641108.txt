In
a recent report, we demonstrated that few-nanometer-thick yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ) coating on a porous Pt cathode of a solid oxide fuel
cell is an excellent facilitator of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
kinetics and an effective suppressor of Pt agglomeration. In this
article, we reveal the actual role of the YSZ overcoat in the ORR
process through a series of electrochemical analyses. Without the
overcoat, the nanoporous Pt is significantly agglomerated during a
high-temperature operation and the ORR becomes limited by the availability
of triple phase boundaries (TPBs). An ultrathin YSZ overcoat prevents
the ORR process from being limited by TPB area by preserving the morphology
of its underlying Pt layer. More importantly, the overcoat acts as
an excellent facilitator of the atomic-oxygen-species-mediated chemical
process(es) that used to be rate-limiting in the ORR of a noncoated
Pt/YSZ system.

Introduction
Solid oxide fuel cells
(SOFCs) have been widely studied as an alternative
clean power source because of their advantages in terms of fuel flexibility,
system simplicity, and efficiency.1,2 Despite these
advantages, their high operating temperature (>800 °C) has
limited
their lifetime, cost competitiveness, start-up/shut-down speed, and
applicability to small-scale devices.3−5 However, reduction of
operating temperature down to an intermediate (600–800 °C)
or a low (<600 °C) temperature regime results in a dramatic
loss of kinetics in both ionic transport and electrode reaction.6−9 Recently, researchers have addressed the issue of sluggish ionic
transport kinetics of low-temperature SOFCs by thinning conventional
electrolytes down to few hundreds of nanometers.2,5 For
the cathode, porous Pt is still the material of choice due to its
superb catalytic performance despite its high cost and limited availability.10,11

For catalysis per mass and volume, catalysts with a maximized
surface
area are preferred. As the size of catalysts becomes smaller, the
surface area to volume ratio and thus the proportion of catalytically
active low-coordination sites become larger. However, these high-surface
catalysts are prone to agglomeration, degrading their overall catalytic
activity during operation. One of the most widely used methods to
suppress the agglomeration is to interface the metal catalyst with
an oxide.12−19 Usual approaches include coating metal catalysts by a gas-permeable
oxide film through chemical vapor deposition and wet chemistry.19−21 However, these approaches do not provide a precise control over
the thickness and uniformity of the oxides, let alone the location
and area of oxide–metal interfaces newly formed by the coating,
making a reproducible and maximized catalytic performance difficult
to achieve. Recently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as
a promising tool to overcome these issues with its fascinating capabilities.
The self-limiting nature of ALD offers atomic-scale thickness control
and enables highly uniform and conformal films with excellent reproducibility.22

In our recent study, an ultrathin layer
of yttrium-stabilized zirconia
(YSZ) was coated on a highly porous Pt cathode by ALD to suppress
Pt agglomeration for a low-temperature SOFC.23 Even a few-nanometer-thick coating was found to suppress the morphological
degradation of nanoporous Pt, which was confirmed by other researchers
as well.24,25 To our surprise, it was also found that
the oxide coating enhanced the catalytic activity toward the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) even if the oxide is expected to cover (and
thus deactivate) part of catalytically active Pt surface. In this
article, a mechanistic study was performed to understand the impact
of ultrathin ALD coating on catalytic kinetics, especially for ORR
on a Pt/YSZ system.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows schematic
diagrams of two different kinds of cells examined in this study. One
is a Pt/YSZ/Pt cell in which porous Pt was sputter-deposited on both
sides of a 270 μm thick YSZ substrate. The other cell is based
upon the same Pt/YSZ/Pt cell, but an ultrathin layer of YSZ is coated
on one of the two Pt electrodes by ALD (see the Experimental
Section). We call them BP (bare Pt-based) and CP (coated Pt-based)
cells, respectively. Figure 2 includes time-dependent power densities of a BP and a CP
cell and the corresponding polarization curves obtained at t = 1, 3, and 14 h at 600 °C. Before the measurement,
the cells were heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1, and the aging clock started as soon as the temperature
of the furnace enclosing the cell reached 600 °C. A continuous
cell bias of 0.2 V was applied throughout the aging test except for
the duration of intermittent impedance and polarization measurements.
The trend of power density with time is very similar to that in our
recent study, in which a significantly enhanced thermal stability
was achieved by an ultrathin YSZ overcoat on a Pt-based cathode.23 The BP cell degraded very fast from the initial
power density of 1.57 W cm–2 measured at t = 1 h to 0.26 W cm–2 at t = 14 h under high-temperature polarization. On the other hand, the
CP cell maintained its powering capability with a relatively insignificant
change from 8.66 to 7.11 W cm–2. Most of its degradation
occurred in the first few hours, and the power density at t = 14 h was 98.7% of the value at t =
5 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of cathodes before
and after the 14 h long operation are presented in Figure 3. As reported earlier,23 an ultrathin ALD-based YSZ coating preserved
the nanogranular microstructure during the high-temperature operation,
whereas the noncoated Pt suffered from a severe agglomeration. In
addition, the initially uniform YSZ overcoat is conjectured to have
agglomerated into nanoscale islands or an interconnected network after
being exposed to a high temperature,23 making
room for O2 access to the Pt surface, as depicted in the
insets of Figure 3.

study.

The ORR process comprises smaller steps. In a Pt/YSZ system, these
steps are as follows: (1) adsorption of molecular oxygen on the catalyst
surface, (2) dissociation of molecular oxygen into atomic species,
(3) surface diffusion of atomic oxygen to the triple phase boundary
(TPB), (4) charge transfer reaction, and (5) incorporation of oxygen
ions into electrolyte. To better understand the main factors effecting
the discrepancy in the performance between the two cells presented above, we first
studied ORR kinetics under different oxygen partial pressures (p(O2)) ranging from 0.04 to 1.0 atm. The reaction
order, m, defined in relation Rp–1 ∝ p(O2)m (Rp, electrode
polarization resistance), provides abundant clues about the rate-limiting
step.26 For example, reaction order of m = 1 indicates that the rate-determining step is likely
related to a molecular-oxygen-mediated process, such as O2 adsorption and diffusion. A square root p(O2) dependence (m = 1/2) corresponds to an
atomic-oxygen-related process, including dissociation into atomic
oxygen species and their surface transport, and the m = 1/4 dependence can be ascribed to a process related to the charge
transfer reaction.27

Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a
BP and a CP cell, and the resulting spectra are presented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. Each cell was continuously exposed to the
operational condition of choice (cell bias of 0.2 V at 600 °C),
and the p(O2) dependence of ORR kinetics
was measured at t = 1 and 14 h. Each EIS was performed
only when the electrical current measured at the cell bias of 0.2
V had not changed by more than ∼3% for 1 min after each p(O2) change, which usually corresponds to 2–7
min after p(O2) changes. For both BP and
CP cells, the shape of the spectra obtained at t =
1 h hints that at least two R/CPE components can fit in there, whereas it is hard to resolve multiple R/CPE components from
those measured at t = 14 h with reasonable accuracy.
Therefore, for data fitting, two different equivalent circuits (Figure 6a) were used accordingly
to extract each characteristic electrode resistance. The resulting
electrode resistances are presented in Figure 6b (BP) and Figure 6c (CP) (see Table S1 in Supporting Information for the EIS fitting parameters). R1 is the ohmic resistance originated mainly
from ionic transport through the electrolyte, which approximately
corresponds to the high-frequency intercept on the real axis of the
Nyquist plot. R2 and R3 are assigned to the electrode resistances. It is postulated
that both R2 and R3 correspond to cathodic polarization resistances because little
meaningful change in these resistances was found by the change of
H2 flow rate ranging from 30 to 80 sccm. Cathodic overpotential
is also widely accepted to dominate electrode loss in low-/intermediate-temperature
SOFCs.24,28−30 It is also noted that
all of the resistance values presented in this report are normalized
by the cell area of 0.37 cm2. The 1 h data fitted to equivalent
circuit 1 shows that there are two distinct electrode processes that
follow relation Rp–1 ∝ p(O2)m. First, for the BP cell, R2 shows a
trend of m = 1.107 (close to 1), which is likely
to indicate a molecular-oxygen-mediated process.26,31 The m value of R3 is
0.463 (close to 0.5) and is ascribed to an atomic-oxygen-mediated
process such as dissociation of oxygen into atomic oxygen species
and their surface diffusion to the active sites at TPB.31,32R3 is significantly larger than R2 approximately by an order of magnitude throughout
the p(O2) range studied here, and the
overall ORR process at t = 1 h is thus limited by
the oxygen dissociation process and/or surface transport of electroactive
oxygen species. After 14 h, under a continuous cell bias of 0.2 V
at 600 °C, the overall electrode resistance increased by more
than 2 orders of magnitude and its p(O2) dependency became m = 0.15, implying a charge-transfer-limited
ORR process.33 As the charge transfer process
is known to be much faster than chemically driven processes such as
dissociative adsorption and atomic surface diffusion, the interpretation
of m above is well-aligned with the fact that the
peak frequency at t = 14 h is found to be higher
than that at t = 1 h approximately by an order of
magnitude, as can be compared in Figure 4b,d.

BP cell with various p(O2)’s at t = 1 and

O2/N2 mixture are being fed to the anode and
cathode, respectively. p(O2) is controlled
by the ratio of O2 and N2 flow rates.

The resulting area-specific electrode polarization resistances of
the BP and CP cells as a function of p(O2). The resulting reaction order, m, was obtained
by the least-squares fitting of each dataset.

This inference is corroborated by dc-bias-dependent impedance
measurements
compiled in Figure 7. The total electrode resistances (R2 + R3 for 1 h cells and R2 for 14 h cells) were extracted from impedance data obtained
with different cell biases ranging from 0 to 0.4 V. If an ORR rate
is limited by a charge transfer reaction, the electrode resistance
would follow the Tafel behavior. Then, the area-specific electrode
resistance (ASR) for ORR from an impedance measurement is expressed
as34  where α is the electron transfer coefficient, n is the number of electrons per species, F is the
Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, j is the current
density, j0 is the exchange current density,
and η is the ORR overpotential. According to this equation,
the slope of the logarithmic ASR versus overpotential graph can be
used to quantify αn. As for the BP cell at t = 1 h, not only the logarithmic ASR versus η deviates
from the linear behavior significantly but also αn is calculated to be <0.4, indicating that the charge transfer
reaction is unlikely to be the rate-limiting factor. (Note that the
usual α is in the vicinity of 0.5.) At t =
14 h, the αn value becomes ∼0.8, making
it reasonable to consider that the measured quantities correspond
to the charge transfer process. Here, the change in the rate-determining
step of ORR after 14 h is ascribed solely to the geometric agglomeration
of Pt, not to other factors such as oxidation of Pt surface, because,
whereas a very thin layer of PtO2 would reside on its surface,
this oxide is known to decompose into Pt and O2 at >∼450
°C (in 1 atm of oxygen).35

Figure 7 ASRs with cell
overpotential η obtained from EIS measurements
of the BP and CP cells under various p(O2)’s. Equivalent circuits shown in Figure 6a were used to extract the ASRs.

On the other hand, the CP cell showed the overall
electrode resistances
and power densities much smaller than those of the BP cell, as shown
in Figures 6 and 2, respectively. Interestingly, this is the case
from a very early stage of operation when the nanoporous Pt of the
BP cell is not expected to have developed significant agglomeration.
This indicates that the effect of suppressed agglomeration only cannot
fully explain the oxide-overcoat-induced enhancement of ORR kinetics.
In Figure 6c, the two
electrode resistances of the CP cell at t = 1 h exhibit
different p(O2) dependences as those of
the BP cell did. The processes characterized by R2/CPE2 and R3/CPE3 have reaction orders of m = 0.844 (close to 1.0) and 0.034 (close to 0), respectively.
Overall, the R3/CPE3 process dominates R2/CPE2, especially above 0.2 atm of oxygen. First,
the R2/CPE2 process is likely to correspond
to a process involving molecular O2 species such as O2 adsorption as reported in a recent ORR mechanism study for
ultrathin ZrO2-coated Pt by Liu et al.25 On the other hand, the very small m value
of the R3/CPE3 process can be ascribed to the
incorporation of oxide ions (O2–) into the vacancies
of electrolyte or gaseous O2 diffusion on the surface of
Pt.31,36 If the ORR rate is governed by O2 diffusion, Rct is not expected to show
an explicit temperature dependency. As the CP cell shows an Arrhenius
behavior with the activation energy of 1.26 eV at open-circuit voltage
(OCV) and 1.14 eV at n = 0.3 V (Figure 8), it is reasonable to ascribe
the process with m = 0.034 to the charge incorporation
process. Alternatively, the following scenario is possible for the
CP cell. As Pt is partially covered by an ultrathin layer of YSZ,
either in a well-connected network or in dispersed islands, the effective
electrochemically active sites where Pt, air, and O2– conducting channel meet altogether should have been enlarged significantly.
The ionic species generated at these sites may travel through the
newly formed Pt/YSZ interfaces, and this may be responsible for the
activation energy of 1.14 eV. However, the ionic transport through
the nanothin YSZ overcoat itself is likely negligible because the
overcoat is very thin and probably not well-connected all of the way
to the electrolyte interface. If the new Pt/YSZ interface became actually
a new channel of O2– transport, the distance through
which the dissociated atomic species needed to travel on the Pt surface
should be reduced significantly by the overcoat, making the overall
ORR kinetics much facilitated. This explanation is also well-aligned
with the disappearance of the process with m = ∼0.5
that used to be dominant in the BP cell. The αn value quantified even from the steepest slope of Figure 7c,d (between η = 0 and
0.2 V) was <0.15 for both 1 and 14 h data. Given the usual α
value of ∼0.5, the resulting n is too small
to correspond to the charge transfer process of ORR. It is noted that Figure 7 is based upon the
cell overpotential, not the activation overpotential. However, ohmic
overpotential comprises <10% of the total cell overpotential even
under the cell overpotential of 0.4 V and thus is not significant
enough to affect the arguments discussed above.

Figure 8 Arrhenius plot of the
BP and CP cells measured under (a) η
= 0 V (OCV condition) and (b) η = 0.3 V. The measurements were
performed at 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C in the decreasing
sequence after the cells were exposed to 600 °C for 14 h.

The aforementioned observations
can be summarized as follows. First,
in our BP cell, a chemical process mediated by atomic oxygen species
is the limiting process in ORR when the Pt electrode is relatively
intact (at t = 1 h). As agglomeration continues during
the operation at 600 °C, the site for charge transfer reaction
(i.e., TPB) will become significantly smaller, which is further supported
by the morphology images shown in Figure 3, making the overall ORR kinetics limited
by the charge transfer step. As for the CP cell, the ORR is governed
by either O2– incorporation into the electrolyte
or O2– transport through the newly formed Pt/YSZ
interfaces, whereas molecular O2 adsorption also becomes
a considerable rate-limiting process at low oxygen pressures (p(O2) < 0.1 atm). It is also noted that the
process with m = 0.463 visible in the BP cell disappears
in the CP cell. This suggests that the rate-limiting step in the BP
cell (atomic-oxygen-mediated processes) becomes highly facilitated
by an ultrathin YSZ overcoat and does not function as the rate-limiting
step in the CP cell.

Conclusions
It was reported earlier
that a highly uniform atomic-/nanoscale
YSZ overcoat on a Pt catalyst enabled by ALD preserves the underlying
Pt nanostructure and even enhanced the ORR kinetics significantly.23 Although the impact of overcoat on the Pt agglomeration
seems obvious, it stayed mysterious that the CP cell shows higher
ORR activity than the BP cell even when the bare Pt was not agglomerated.
In this article, the mechanism of catalysis enhancement is presented
through a series of electrochemical measurements. First, the ORR kinetics
on a fresh nanoporous Pt/YSZ system is mainly governed by an atomic-oxygen-mediated
chemical process. After Pt becomes highly agglomerated during the
high-temperature operation, the rate-limiting step shifted to the
charge transfer reaction due to a much smaller TPB area. On the other
hand, a nanoporous Pt catalyst with a well-dispersed nanoscale YSZ
overcoat seems to exhibit an ORR process mainly limited by the O2– incorporation or O2– transport
through the new Pt/YSZ interfaces formed by the YSZ overcoat, whereas
the molecular O2 adsorption process also plays a considerable
rate-determining role especially at a low p(O2) regime (<0.1 atm). With these observations, the YSZ overcoat
on Pt can be regarded as a significant facilitator of chemical processes
related to atomic oxygen species during ORR in addition to an effective
suppressor of Pt agglomeration.

Experimental Section
Electrolyte-supported Pt/YSZ/Pt cells were fabricated for electrochemical
characterization. Pt layers of ∼100 nm were deposited on both
sides of a ∼270 μm thick commercial electrolyte (Fuel
Cell Materials) with an ac magnetron sputter at 30 W with an Ar pressure
of 55 mtorr. The Pt electrodes with the active area of 0.37 cm2 were patterned using a polyimide tape before sputter deposition.
The ultrathin YSZ overcoat was prepared in a commercial ALD system
(ICOT Inc.). Tetrakis (dimethylamino)zirconium and Zr(NMe2)4 and Tris (methylcyclopentadienyl)yttrium and Y(MeCp)3 were used as the precursors of Zr and Y, respectively. Ar
(99.999%) and distilled water were used as the purging gas and oxidant,
respectively. The ratio of cycles between ZrO2 and Y2O3 deposition was 4:1 to render ∼7.5 mol
% YSZ as quantified by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system
(PHI XPS; see Figure S1 for the spectrum).
The canister temperatures for ZrO2 and Y2O3 were 85 and 160 °C, respectively, and the line temperature
was 180 °C. The chamber temperature was set at 250 °C. The
ALD supercycles were performed on the porous cathode 6 times to make
a ∼3 nm thick YSZ coating. The microstructures of thin films
were characterized by a field-emission SEM (Zeiss GeminiSEM) at the
operating voltage of 3–5 kV.

Electrochemical characterization
was performed in a home-made solid
oxide cell test setup. Cells with the active area of 0.37 cm2 were placed between two current-collecting Pt meshes (Goodfellow
Co.). The cell was enclosed in a furnace in which the operating temperature
is controlled at a set point through a feedback loop. Polarization
curves and EIS spectra were obtained using a potentiostat and impedance
analyzer (BioLogic SP-240). The EIS was performed with a 20 mV perturbation
and a dc bias ranging from OCV to η = 0.4 V at the frequency
of 10–1–106 Hz. During the characterization,
50 sccm of dry H2 (99.999%) was fed to the anode, whereas
various combinations of O2 and N2 (total of
50 sccm) were fed to the cathode side to control the O2 partial pressure ranging from 0.04 to 1.0 atm. The resulting EIS
spectra were fitted to the equivalent circuit using commercial software
(EC-Lab, Bio-Logic Science Instruments).
