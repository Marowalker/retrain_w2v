Crystalline
iron oxides/hydroxides are generally preferred as supercapacitor
electrode materials instead of the low-crystalline structure, despite
the fact that an amorphous phase could have a comprehensive electrochemical
performance owing to its structural disorder. Herein, we present a
facile and scalable method for preparing amorphous FeOOH nanoflowers@multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs) composites. The resulting hybrid
nanoflowers hold a distinctive heterostructure composed of a self-assembled
amorphous FeOOH nanofilm on the MWCNTs surface. The low-crystalline
1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composites at pH 8 exhibit a high comprehensive
capacitive performance, which may be attributed to the advantageous
structural features. In a −0.85 to 0 V vs Ag/AgCl potential
window, the prepared hybrid electrode delivers a high specific capacitance
of 345 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1, good cycling stability (76.4% capacity retention over 5000 consecutive
cycles), and outstanding rate performance (167 F g–1 at 11.4 A g–1). This work may trigger the possibilities
of these nanomaterials for further application in supercapacitor electrodes,
specifically low-crystalline oxide/hydroxide-based electrode materials.

1 Introduction
With the decreasing availability
of nonrenewable resources, there
is an emerging demand for sustainable and renewable energy resources
in complementing or replacing the traditional energy resources. At
the forefront of renewable energy development are superior electrical
performance energy storage and conversion systems that have great
potential in high-power flexible electronics, chemical sensors, and
electrical power applications.1−4 A supercapacitor, also called ultracapacitor or electrochemical
capacitor, has received tremendous attention as an efficient electrical
energy storage device currently because of its outstanding power density
(1–10 kW kg–1), fast charging/discharging
rates (a few seconds), and good cycle life (over 100 000 cycles).5−9 Therefore, supercapacitor not only is a promising and competitive
candidate for energy storage systems but also uniquely possesses the
merits of both rechargeable batteries and traditional dielectric capacitors.10 Nevertheless, insufficient energy density (∼10
Wh kg–1) is still the major disadvantage of supercapacitors,
which could not meet the increasing energy demands for electric power
applications. The key to enhancing the energy storage ability of supercapacitors
is to develop advanced electrode materials because the device capacitance
(C) and voltage window (V) contribute
to the energy density (E = 1/2 CV2).11,12 Hence, great efforts should be
devoted to developing appropriate electrode materials. Depending on
the fundamental charge storage mechanisms, the supercapacitor electrode
materials are of two types: (i) electrochemical double-layer capacitive
(EDLC) materials (activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and
carbon fibers)13−15 and (ii) pseudocapacitive materials (transition-metal
oxides/hydroxides and conductive polymers).16−18 Pseudocapacitive
materials usually have a higher energy density owing to their fast
surface/near-surface Faradic redox reactions.19,20

Recently, supercapacitors have been found to achieve high
energy
density while maintaining their high power density.21 Carbon-based materials have been usually preferred as anode
materials in supercapacitors thanks to their large specific surface
area, outstanding electrical conductivity, and high power density;
nevertheless, the attained low specific capacitance highly hinders
the energy density of supercapacitors, which makes them unattractive
in meeting the energy requirements of future industrial systems.22,23 Much research efforts have been devoted to exploring new anode materials,
such as Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Mo/V-based transition-metal oxides/hydroxides,
to attain high specific capacitance.24,25 Among these
Faradic anode materials, crystalline iron oxides/hydroxides have been
commonly used as anode materials for supercapacitors owing to their
large theoretical capacitance, natural abundance, and nontoxicity.5,23 Although high performance has been attained for these materials,
most of them exhibit unsatisfactory stability and electrical conductivity
(∼10–14 S/cm).26 A high-crystalline structure has difficulties to expand or contract,
which hinder the permeation and diffusion of ions.27 Amorphous metal oxides are available to achieve better
electrochemical activity than a crystalline phase owing to their high
structural disorder and defects.28 To the
best of our knowledge, it is still a key challenge to investigate
the electrochemical performance of low-crystalline iron oxides/hydroxides,
which may have potential applications in designing future supercapacitors.

Among the available alternative iron oxides/hydroxides, iron oxide
hydroxide (FeOOH) have always been recognized as an appealing supercapacitor
anode material because of its unique tunnel structure, providing a
short electrolyte ion diffusion path.29 However, FeOOH displays limited specific capacitance and rate capability
owing to its intrinsic weaker properties such as low specific surface
area and poor electrical conductivity.5,11 Alternatively,
multicomponent systems assembling FeOOH nanoparticles on a carbon
matrix (graphene, active carbon, carbon black, etc.) have been proposed
to enhance the capacitive performance.30 Based on the above discussion, we present a novel chemical method
(in which the reaction proceeds in an organic solvent) to prepare
low-crystalline FeOOH nanoflowers@multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FeOOH
NFs@MWCNTs) hybrid nanosheets. The combined FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs heterostructures
feature a low-crystalline FeOOH NF self-assembled mesoporous nanofilm
tightly anchored on the MWCNTs nanosheets, presenting a large surface
area and short electron transport paths, resulting in superior capacitive
performance because of the rich redox reactions and enhanced electronic
conductivity. Moreover, the impact of electrolytes with different
pH values on the electrode electrochemical performance has also been
further investigated. By optimizing the mass ratio of amorphous FeOOH
NFs to MWCNTs in the composite, a remarkable specific capacitance
of about 345 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 has
been acquired for the amorphous 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs hybrid nanosheets
at pH 8, which delivers comparable or superior electrochemical properties
to those reported for the crystalline counterpart, revealing significant
improvement for exploring promising supercapacitor electrode materials.

2 Results and Discussion
The amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs
hybrid nanoflowers were achieved
via a new facile synthesis method; the process is schematically shown
in Scheme 1. The chemical
reaction used in the novel synthesis process is shown below 1

Hybrid Nanoflowers
2.1 Characterization
of Low-Crystalline FeOOH
NFs@MWCNTs Hybrid Nanoflowers
Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectral analysis was performed in a broad band from 4000 to
400 cm–1. Figure 1a illustrates the FTIR spectra of the amorphous FeOOH
NFs, MWCNTs, and FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs. The absorption band located at
around 3448 cm–1, which was attributed to the hydroxyl
groups on the samples, corresponds to the symmetric −OH bending
vibrations in all of the samples. The FTIR spectrum of FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs
composites exhibits characteristic bands at 1623, 1384, and 1114 cm–1, which can be assigned to the oxygen-containing functional
groups (C=O, C–H, and C–O, respectively). The
observed peak at 696 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching
vibrations of Fe–O. The representative FTIR spectrum of FeOOH
NFs is the same as that of FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs, indicating that the FeOOH
nanofilm is significantly anchored on the surface of MWCNTs.

Figure 1 (a) FTIR spectra
and (b) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FeOOH
NFs, MWCNTs, and FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs.

The crystalline structure of the samples was identified by XRD
analysis. Figure 1b
shows the XRD patterns of the pristine FeOOH NFs, MWCNTs, and FeOOH
NFs@MWCNTs composites. The FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composites with different
FeOOH NFs/MWCNTs mass ratios of of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 6:1 are
denoted as 0.5FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs, 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs, 2FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs,
3FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs, and 6FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs, respectively. The FeOOH
NF sample shows no diffraction peaks, indicating a low-crystalline
structure. A peak at about 24° is obtained in the MWCNTs XRD
pattern, which is assigned to the (002) reflection of MWCNTs. The
FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs sample also shows the same diffraction peak, and
the diffraction peak intensity is increased with the increase in the
content of MWCNTs. Furthermore, all of the FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs samples
show no FeOOH diffraction peaks, indicating the low-crystalline structure
of FeOOH NFs in the samples.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were further
performed to verify the presence of the surface-bonded elements and
their valence states in the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite. Figure 2a shows the XPS full-survey-scan
spectrum of the sample, revealing the presence of Fe, O, and C elements
in the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite. The core-level spectrum of Fe
2p (Figure 2b) exhibits
two characteristic binding energies at 711.6 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 726.2 eV (Fe 2p1/2), as well as two shake-up satellite
peaks (719.5 and 733.2 eV), which are highly consistent with those
previously reported for amorphous FeOOH.28,30 The O 1s core-level spectrum (Figure 2c) could be deconvoluted into three chemically representative
species corresponding to the Fe–O–Fe bond (530.4 eV),
Fe–O–H bond (531.8 eV), and H–O–H bond
(533.4 eV).11,28 Notably, the H–O–H
bond is assigned to adsorbed water, which indicates that the amorphous
FeOOH nanoflowers are in a hydrated form.30 The C 1s core-level spectrum is displayed in Figure 2d, which could be integrated into four main
constituent peaks. The peak at a binding energy of 284.6 eV is assigned
to the graphitic carbon in MWCNTs, while other three peaks correspond
to the epoxy and hydroxyl (C–O, 286.2 eV), carbonyl (C=O,
287.5 eV), and oxygenated carbons of carboxyl (O–C=O,
288.4 eV),11 demonstrating the existence
of a variety of carbon–oxygen functional groups on the surface
of MWCNTs. Moreover, the formation of C–O bonds may reveal
C–O–Fe, C–O–C, and C–O–H
bonds in the amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composites.28

O 1s core-level spectrum, and (d) C 1s core-level spectrum of the
1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composites.

In summary, the FTIR, XRD, and XPS results are in agreement with
each other, revealing the formation of a continuous amorphous FeOOH
nanflowers on the surface of MWCNTs.

Morphological and microstructural
details of the low-crystalline
FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite (1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs) were identified with
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). The SEM image of amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs is shown in Figure 3a, which reveals
a uniformly distributed nanofilm morphology. Figure 3b shows the SEM image of the sample at high
magnification, which indicates that such a microstructure is formed
by the self-assembled FeOOH nanoflowers strongly attached to the MWCNTs
substrate. Figure 3c presents the TEM image of FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composites, revealing
a homogeneous amorphous nanostructure. The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Figure 3c) shows a diffused and broad diffraction
halo ring, revealing the low-crystalline nature of FeOOH. The low-crystalline
structure of the FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs sample could be further confirmed
by high-magnification TEM (Figure 3d) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (inset in Figure 3d), which reveal
that the low-crystalline FeOOH NFs are uniformly grown on the surface
of MWCNTs and self-assembled to be a mesoporous nanofilm, resulting
in the FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs hybrid nanosheets. The mesoporous structure
and large surface area of the low-crystalline FeOOH nanoflowers grown
on the MWCNTs surface endow the sample with short ion diffusion paths
for fast ion transport and more active sites for charge storage, which
are useful for improving the electrochemical performance.

the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite.

2.2 Electrochemical Performance of Amorphous FeOOH
NFs@MWCNTs Hybrid Nanoflowers
To study the electrochemical
performance of amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs hybrid nanoflowers, cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted
in a three-electrode cell with a Pt wire counter electrode and an
Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous
electrolyte. Figure 4a exhibits the CV curves of the amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite
electrodes with different FeOOH NFs/MWCNTs mass ratios tested at a
scan rate of 10 mV s –1 in a −0.85 to 0 V
potential window. The CV curve of the pristine MWCNTs electrode exhibits
a nearly rectangular shape, which denotes the signature of an ideal
double-layer capacitance. However, the current densities of the MWCNTs
electrode are much lower than those of the pseudocapacitive material
electrodes, limiting the rate capability for supercapacitors. Surprisingly,
the current densities are greatly increased when FeOOH NFs are introduced
into MWCNTs, and the FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite electrodes exhibit
quasi-rectangular CV curves, which is characteristic of the pseudocapacitive
behavior.31Figure 4b shows the specific capacitances with scan
rates of FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs samples. The specific capacitance of the
sample greatly increases when FeOOH NFs are introduced into MWCNTs.
When the content of FeOOH NFs increases, the specific capacitance
of the electrode increases until a peak value of about 266 F g–1 is achieved at 10 mV s–1 for 1FeOOH
NFs@1MWCNTs.

composites:

FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite electrodes at a current density of 1 A
g–1. (d) Rate capabilities of the amorphous FeOOH
NFs@MWCNTs composite electrodes as a function of current density.
(e, f) Nyquist plots of the amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite electrodes.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) analysis was
carried out to
assess the rate performance of the amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite. Figure 4c shows the GCD curves
of the amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs with various FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs mass
ratios at 1 A g–1. The GCD curves of MWCNTs in the
working voltage window of −0.85 to 0 V exhibit ideal symmetric
triangle curves, which is characteristic of the double-layer capacitive
behavior with low resistance. Two slight potential plateaus are shown
in the GCD curves of amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs compared with symmetric
GCD curves of MWCNTs, indicating that the pseudocapacitive behavior
corresponds well with CV measurements. The 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs display
a longer discharge time at 1 A g–1 than the other
samples, which reveals a higher specific capacitance. The specific
capacitance was acquired according to the discharge curves and is
displayed in Figure 4d; the specific capacitance can be easily increased with the increase
in the content of FeOOH NFs increases. The 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs hybrid
electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 350 F g–1 at 1 A g–1; when the mass ratio is over 1:1, the
FeOOH NFs anchored on the MWCNTs surface may be overgrown, which indicates
that the anchored FeOOH NFs could not completely work in the redox
reaction; then, the attained specific capacitance decreases.

To provide further insights, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was performed on FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite electrodes and the
homologous Nyquist plots are displayed in Figure 4e,f. For the Nyquist plot, the intercept
at the Zreal axis represents equivalent
series resistance (ESR) (Rs), a small
semicircle in the high-frequency regions correlates to the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct), and the slope of the
low-frequency straight line corresponds to the ion diffusion resistance
(Rd) in the electrolyte. The slope of
the Nyquist plot of the as-prepared electrodes at low frequencies
is almost vertical to Zreal, indicating
a good capacitive response. This clearly indicates a trend that all
resistances of the FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite electrodes decrease
as the content of MWCNTs increases, which may be ascribed to the enlarged
surface area and enhanced electron and ion transport. The EIS spectra
confirmed the sample with superior electrochemical performance, as
revealed by the CV and GCD measurements.

The heterostructure
optimization between amorphous FeOOH NFs and
MWCNTs could effectively exhibit the advantages of every single material
and greatly improve the electrochemical performance. In this work,
although the incorporation of MWCNTs can improve the pseudocapacitance
of FeOOH NFs, the capacitance contribution of MWCNTs itself is limited,
which needs a rational FeOOH NFs/MWCNTs mass ratio to acquire a high
specific capacitance of the samples and find the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs
is the best in this paper.

To the best of our knowledge, the
amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs hybrid
nanosheet electrode developed in this work exhibits comparable or
superior electrochemical performances to those reported in the literature
for oxide/hydroxide-based electrodes in neutral aqueous electrolytes
(Table 1).11,17,32−41

The pH value of the supporting electrolyte presents a significant
influence on the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite electrode by affecting
both the specific capacitances and impedance. Figure 5a shows GCD profiles of the electrode in
0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with various pH values,
and Figure 5b illustrates
the dependencies of the specific capacitances on the electrolyte pH.
The specific capacitances increase with increasing electrolyte pH
value, while the specific capacitance acquires a maximum of about
320 F g–1 for 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite electrode
at around pH 7. In addition, the specific capacitances shifted negatively
with increasing pH, showing that ions, electrons, and protons have
partly taken part in the redox reaction processes. To evaluate the
electrochemical influence of the electrolyte pH value, we reported
the EIS recorded in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz, as depicted
in Figure 5c. With
the increase in the electrolyte pH value, all resistances of the composite
electrodes kept decreasing. The resistance of the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs
composite electrode increases with the increasing pH value of the
electrolyte; however, they still exhibit excellent rate capabilities.

pH values with a voltage window of 0.85 V. (b) Specific capacitances

As a key factor to evaluate the electrochemical properties
of a
supercapacitor, long-term cycle stability of the low-crystalline FeOOH
NFs@MWCNTs sample was studied, and the acquired results are displayed
in Figure 6. For cycling
performance measurement, the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite electrode
was charged and discharged between −0.85 and 0 V at 1 A g–1 for 1000 and 5000 cycles. Based on the GCD profiles,
the acquired capacitance retentions for the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs electrode
after 1000 cycles are 98.9, 85.9, 61.9, 25.4, and 20.7% in solutions
with different pH values of 10, 8, 7, 6, and 4, respectively. As shown
in Figure 6f, only
14.1% of the initial response was lost after 1000 cycles and 76.4%
of the capacitance was retained up to 5000 cycles, indicating its
long cycle life. Furthermore, the SEM images in Figure 7 show its original morphology (Figure 7a) with much more broken regions
after 1000 cycles in the electrolyte with pH 4 (Figure 7b) than after 5000 cycles in the electrolyte
with pH 8 (Figure 7c), which demonstrated its excellent structural stability in solutions
with pH around 8.

(insets are the corresponding typical GCD profiles before and after

Figure 8 displays
the CV curves of the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite after the first,
100th, and 1000th cycles in solutions with different pH values. As
illustrated in Figure 8b, the CV profile of the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs electrode after the 1000th
cycle exhibits obvious redox peaks at −0.32 V for the cathodic
scan and at −0.50 V for the anodic scan, which may be ascribed
to the reversible valence change of Fe in FeOOH. It also displays
a capacity retention of 94% after 1000 CV cycles, revealing the good
cycle life of the electrode.

in the first cycle
and after 100th and 1000th cycles in solutions with different pH values
of (a) 12, (b) 8, and (c) 4.

Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide were preferred to adjust the
pH values of electrolytes. Based on the above discussion, a pH value
of 8 was chosen for the following experiment, which is closer to that
of the physical conditions. Therefore, the low-crystalline feature
of the FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs composite results in excellent structural
stability and superior redox reactions, revealing high performance
as a supercapacitor electrode.

To exhibit the superior electrochemical
performance of the amorphous
1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite electrode for electrochemical energy
storage, GCD and CV measurements were conducted in a three-electrode
configuration in the electrolyte with pH 8. Figure 9a shows the GCD profiles of the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs
electrode measured at different current densities ranging from 0.72
to 11.43 A g–1 in the voltage window between −0.85
and 0 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The GCD curves at various current densities
exhibit almost symmetric and perfect symmetric triangles, demonstrating
a nearly ideal capacitive behavior. In addition, GCD profiles display
a small voltage drop of 0.016 V when the device begins to discharge,
which is indicative of the electrode with a low equivalent series
resistance (ESR). Based on the GCD profiles, the measured specific
capacitances for the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs electrode are 365.54, 252.26,
203.66, 185.14, and 166.63 F g–1 at 0.72, 1.43,
2.86, 5.72, and 11.43 A g–1, respectively, as shown
in Figure 9c. Figure 9b shows the CV profiles
of the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs composite electrode measured at various
scan rates from 10 to 100 mV s–1 in a −0.85
to 0 V vs Ag/AgCl voltage window. The electrode shows quasi-rectangular
CV shapes at various scan rates, which is indicative of a nearly typical
pseudocapacitive behavior. Additionally, the CV profiles exhibit a
clear current leap near the end of −0.85 V at anodic scans.
The current leaps at around −0.85 V indicate an initiation
of a redox reaction, which may be attributed to the valence change
of Fe. Figure 9d displays
the specific capacitance of the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs electrode as a
function of the scan rate. The electrode can deliver a high specific
capacitance of 277.26 F g–1 at a scan rate of 10
mV s–1. With the increase of scan rate to 100 mV
s–1, a specific capacitance of 166.73 F g –1 can be maintained, corresponding to 60.13% of the capacitance at
10 mV s–1, in agreement with its good charge storage
ability.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared
amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs hybrid
nanosheets through a facile and scalable method. The low-crystalline
FeOOH NFs/MWCNTs composites possess a homogeneous heterostructure,
which was constructed by a self-assembled FeOOH NF mesoporous nanofilm
strongly attached to the MWCNTs substrate. Interestingly, the amorphous
design of the pseudocapacitive electrode with suitable pH values of
the electrolytes results in an excellent electrochemical performance
for the supercapacitor electrode. By adjusting the mass ratio of amorphous
FeOOH NFs and MWCNTs, the 1FeOOH NFs@1MWCNTs electrode (pH 8) displays
a large specific capacitance of up to 345 F g–1,
an outstanding rate capability, and great cycle stability. The superior
electrochemical performance of the electrode may be ascribed to the
following aspects: (i) the predominant capacitive contribution of
the amorphous FeOOH NFs results in high specific capacitance; (ii)
the mesoporous structure and high surface area of the electrode materials
provide more active sites for storing energy; and (iii) the FeOOH
NFs are directly anchored on conductive MWCNTs, providing fast ion/electronic
transport and easy accessibility of the active materials to electrolytes.
Thus, our work may provide great potential for developing low-cost
environmentally benign amorphous-based supercapacitor electrode materials
in electric applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
FeCl3·6H2O, NH4HCO3, and ethanol were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Ourchem Shanghai). MWCNTs
were supplied by Timesnano China (Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd.,
Chinese Academy of Sciences). All chemicals employed in the present
paper were analytical reagents and used as received. Carbon paper
(CeTech, Taiwan) was employed as the conductive substrate for the
as-synthesized materials. Deionized (DI) water with a resistivity
of over 18.25 MΩ·cm at 23 °C was used throughout the
experiment.

4.2 Synthesis of FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs
Hybrid Nanoflowers
The amorphous FeOOH NFs@MWCNTs hybrid
nanoflowers were obtained
via a new facile synthesis method. In a typical preparation, 5 mmol
of FeCl3·6H2O was added to 40 mL of ethanol
and stirred for 0.5 h. Afterward, certain amounts of MWCNTs were added
and dispersed by 20 min ultrasonication, which may give a uniform
mixing between FeCl3 and MWCNTs in the composite. After
that, 15 mmol of NH4HCO3 was dissolved in the
solution and the solution was stirred in a ventilation cabinet for
12 h. Subsequently, the obtained products were separated by centrifugation,
washed several times using DI water, and dried at 80 °C in a
vacuum oven for use.

4.3 Characterization
The structural characterization
and phase purity of the as-prepared samples were investigated by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR, Bruker Tensor 27, Germany), X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Bruker-AXS D8 Advance with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Escalab
250Xi instrument). The morphological characterizations and microstructure
of the as-synthesized samples were recorded by cold field emission
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4800, Japan) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Tecnai G2 F20).

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
The
electrochemical measurements of the as-prepared samples were conducted
on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments
Co.) with a standard three-electrode cell system using the as-synthesized
materials on the carbon paper as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated
KCl) as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode.
The electrochemical performances of the electrodes were assessed by
cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements
(GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 0.5 M
Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The EIS measurements
were carried out using a sinusoidal signal over a frequency range
from 0.1 to 105 Hz, with an amplitude of 5 mV.

The
specific capacitances of the electrodes were obtained from the GCD
curves at various current densities using the following equation

 2  where Cs (F g–1) is the specific capacitance, I (A)
is the constant discharge current, Δt (s) is
the discharge time, m (g) is the mass of the electroactive
material, and ΔV (V) is the discharge voltage
range excluding the voltage drop.

The specific capacitances
of the electrodes can also be obtained
from the CV curves at different scan rates.
