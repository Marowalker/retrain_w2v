Environmentally benign mechanochemistry-assisted
high-yielding
synthesis of fluorescein-phenylalaninol (FPA) conjugates as a Schiff
base receptor is reported herein. This newly synthesized fluorescent
probe is found to be most exciting and efficient because of its simultaneous
detection and removal of mercury ions (Hg2+) in aqueous
medium and industrial effluents through precipitate formation. The
receptor successfully worked as a chemosensor in selectively sensing
the Hg2+ ion through the rapid transition from yellow to
pink in the colorimetric as well as quenching of fluorescence intensity
in the fluorometric assay. The removal of mercury ions was confirmed
by the inductively coupled plasma analysis of the supernatant. The
lower detection limit of Hg2+ ions for the receptor FPA
is 1.65 and 0.34 μM as determined through absorption and fluorescence
spectroscopic methods, respectively. The high removal efficiency (∼98%)
of the mercury ions is promising and could be achieved via the formation
of the complex in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of receptor to Hg2+ ions. Furthermore, this probe may be a practical alternative
for use in a paper-based portable device for achieving on-site detection
of mercury ions in solid, solution, and vapor phases.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Efficient
synthesis of an organic compound is crucial for environmental,
economical, and academic benefit. From an ecological perspective,
mechanochemistry is one of the emerging methods1−3 not only because
it is an energy- and time-efficient, high yielding, and atom-economic
protocol but also because it avoids the excessive use of volatile
organic compounds, reagents, and harsh conditions. The direct release
of the untreated wastage material after large scale production from
industries became a threat to the health of humans and other animals.
In this context, the residues of heavy metals released with industrial
effluents (IEs) are an ever-growing challenge to a safe and clean
aquatic environment. Water pollution by heavy metals and IEs has profoundly
influenced the critical water supply and quality of drinking water
in recent times; this contaminated drinking water has become one of
the leading causes of death every year.4 Amongst them, mercury is unhealthy and harmful to human beings and
ecosystems5,6 as it shows the bioaccumulation in most
forms of life on Earth from the environment.7−10

The Earth’s crust,
combustion of fossil fuels, incineration
of mercury-containing products, random and uncontrolled use of mercury-containing
pesticides, bleach production, metal mining and ore processing,11a and various industrial and medical activities
are the primary sources of mercury in the ecosystem.11b,12 It is also responsible for Pink disease, Hunter-Russell syndrome,
Minamata disease, and so on.

A wide variety of methods, based
on organic fluorophores13 or chromophores,14 semiconductor nanocrystalline materials,15 cyclic voltammetry,16 polymeric materials,17 proteins18 and so
on19,20 have been established for the detection
of Hg2+. However, most of the above-mentioned materials
are incompatible for the detection of mercury ions in an aqueous medium
because of their poor water solubility or less sensitivity. Moreover,
the simultaneous detection and removal of Hg2+ in an aqueous
medium are still inadequate and also a portable device for on-site
detection is limited. Therefore, the search for efficient sensing
systems in an aqueous environment to simultaneously detect and remove
Hg2+ ions is highly necessary. The colorimetric and fluorometric
sensing are high throughput detection techniques for the on-site detection
of heavy metal ions in biological and environmental samples.21 In recent years, our research group has already
attempted to develop a sensitive and efficient fluorometric and colorimetric
chemosensor for selective Cu(II) detection. Herein, we report the
mechanochemical synthesis of a sensitive sensor for the simultaneous
detection and removal of Hg2+ from IEs and the construction
of a paper-based portable device.

2 Results
and Discussion
In the course of our continuous exploration
of fluorescent probes/chemosensors
for ion recognition, we have synthesized a potential Hg2+ ion sensor, based on a fluorescein-phenylalaninol (FPA) conjugate
as the Schiff base. The introduction of hydroxy and imine functionalities
into the framework of the probe makes the parent molecule hydrophilic,
which facilitates to bind Hg2+ in an aqueous medium. The
sensor FPA was synthesized by an economical and environmentally benign
mechanochemical method, as described in Scheme 1 from a commercially inexpensive fluorescein
dye. In our previous work, we have produced22 fluorescein monoaldehyde applying Reimer–Tiemann’s
method in 28% yield upon refluxing a mixture of a fluorescein dye
(1), aqueous NaOH solution, CHCl3, and the
catalyst 15-crown-5 in methanol for 12 h. This solution-based (SB)
method was replaced by a mechanochemical (MC) approach using a mortar-pestle
set for grinding them in a solid phase at room temperature for 30
min, providing fluorescein monoaldehyde 2 in 30% yield
and allowing us to scale up the product using 1.0 g (3.0 mmol) of
fluorescein. The structure of the compound was characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy (Figures S1 and S2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of a FPA
Hybrid as a Schiff Base
The synthesis of the FPA (4) hybrid was also carried
out by exploring both the SB and MC methods. In the SB method, fluorescein
monoaldehyde (2), and l-phenylalaninol (3) in methanol were stirred at room temperature for 12 h at
pH 6.5 in the presence of a catalytic amount of AcOH to produce the
Schiff base FPA (4) in 68% yield after chromatographic
purification. As per the MC method, the synthesis of FPA (4) was also achieved by grinding fluorescein monoaldehyde (2), phenylalaninol (3), and methanol (few drops for proper
mixing) together in a mortar/pestle for 20 min to complete the reaction.
It was noted that over time, the product formation was also observed
with the naked eye by the transition of the color from yellow to orange
(Figure 1). On completion,
the reaction mixture was purified through the removal of unreacted
starting materials by washing with a MeOH/DCM (1:40 v/v) mixture to
produce 4 in 76% yields.

Figure 1 Change of color during the mechanochemical
reaction.

In the 1H NMR spectrum,
the disappearance of the signal
of the aldehydic proton at δ 10.63 ppm and the appearance of
a new signal at δ 8.85 ppm of the imine group along with additional
signals at δ 5.11 (s, 1H), and in between δ 3.89 and 2.92
ppm confirmed the attachment of phenylalaninol with the fluorescein
dye. In the 1H NMR spectrum in DMSO-d6, the peak appeared at δ 14.92 ppm for FPA (4) indicates the presence of a strong hydrogen bond between the phenolic
−OH of fluorescein and the N-atom of the imine group (Figures S3 and S4). In the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrum, the peaks at 3053 (O–H stretching),
2956, 2925, 2876, 2841 (C–H stretching of l-phenylalaninol),
and 1646 (C=N stretching of imine) cm–1 can
be assigned to the functionalities present in FPA. The structure of
the FPA was also corroborated from the mass peak that appeared at m/z [HRMS (ESI-TOF)]: calcd for C30H24NO6 ([M + H]+), 494.1603; found,
494.1580 (Figure S5).

The fundamental
physicochemical properties, that is, the solubility
in protic and aprotic solvents, optical behavior, and influence of
pH on the absorbance of the receptor, were studied by absorption spectroscopy.
It is noteworthy to mention that at a fixed concentration, FPA exhibits
the highest absorbance at λmax 490 nm in water; this
might be due to the hydrogen bonding effect of water with FPA (Figure S6), while significant absorbance intensity
of the receptor was not observed in toluene presumably due to increased
aggregation of the insoluble probe in the above-mentioned solvent.
Thus, overall a yellowish fluorescence of the receptor in protic solvents
is observed due to the hydrogen bonding interaction with the solvent
while a light pink or colorless fluorescence in aprotic nonpolar organic
solvents is found due to insolubility and natural aggregation of the
probe (Table S1).

Several factors,
such as high quantum yield, absorption and emission
maxima of fluorescein in the visible region, and the participation
of a Schiff base as a recognition unit for coordination to metal cations
as a Lewis acid were considered in the design of a fluorescein-derived
Schiff base. In addition to the above-mentioned parameters, the pH
as an exogenous factor affected the chromogenic behaviour (or selectivity
and sensitivity) of the receptor. Generally, fluorescein exists in
equilibrium between a fluorescent, ring-opened carboxylic acid form,
and a non-fluorescent closed lactone form, which is very sensitive
to the pH of the medium.23 Thus, the receptor,
which contains a fluorescein core as a signalling unit, is highly
sensitive to pH alterations in sensing metal ions in aqueous environments.
The absorption spectra of the free probe under different pH conditions
were recorded (pH 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, and 12.0) (Figure S7A). The absorption peak at 490 nm of
the metal-free receptor in water was affected by strongly acidic or
alkaline solutions of Tris-buffer because of the existence of an equilibrium
between the open and closed form of the fluorescein core. The results
indicated that a neutral to basic medium might be the suitable condition
for the effective photophysical interaction (Figure S7B).

3 Sensing Studies
For assessing the efficacy of an effective cation probe, the key
factor is the ability to detect a specific metal ion in the presence
of other metal ions. Sustainable scanning studies were performed with
a series of metal ions (125.0 μM) to find out the change in
adsorption behavior of the receptor FPA (4) (25.0 μM)
in an aqueous medium by absorption spectroscopy. The scanning study
(Figure 2) revealed
that out of a large number of environmentally and physiologically
relevant cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, As3+, Er3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, and Sm3+), mercury ions caused an instant color
change of the receptor from fluorescent green to light pink (Figure S8). This was confirmed by a photophysical
study of the FPA–Hg2+ complex providing the hypsochromic
shift of 30 nm in comparison to the λmax value of
FPA (Figure 2, inset).
An absorption band at around 460 nm is observed due to intramolecular
charge transfer where the Hg2+ strongly binds with phenolic
−OH of the fluorescein core, and −OH/–NH of the
phenylalaninol segment of the chemosensor FPA.

the receptor FPA (4) (25.0 μM)
upon addition of various cations (125.0 μM) in water; (inset)
color transition of the FPA in water upon addition of Hg2+ ions.

With a firm understanding of the
spectroscopic properties and responses
of FPA towards Hg2+ in hand, the fluorescein-based probe
was applied to provide a rapid estimation of the total mercury content
and its removal from IEs. The metal-free receptor FPA (4) produced a strong fluorescence emission at λemi 521 nm in water, and excitation at 495 nm where the slit width is
3.0 nm (Figures 3, S9, and S10). The fluorometric response was recorded
before and after the addition of cationic salts, and the results of
the fluorescence titration experiment indicated that Hg2+ quenched the fluorescence intensity of FPA by 8 fold with a red
shift of 3.0 nm showing λemi maxima at 524 nm while
Cu2+ provided a quenching signal with a blue shift of 4.0
nm with λemi maxima at 517 nm.

of various cations (50.0 μM) in water with excitation at 495
nm, emission maxima at 521 nm, slit width 3 nm, and medium sensitivity.
(Inset) The appearance of receptor 4 upon addition of
Hg2+ and Cu2+.

In order to validate the high selectivity of the sensor FPA towards
divalent metal ions, an interference study with other metal ions was
performed by absorbance spectroscopy. The absorption spectra indicated
no considerable interference from other metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ Ca2+,
Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+ Ni2+,
Pb2+, Cd2+, As3+, Er3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, and Sm3+) during Hg2+ ion detection (Figure S11A) and
the intensity of absorbance was almost similar to FPA–Hg2+ complex absorbance intensity (Figure S11B).

The sensitivity and selectivity of the receptor
FPA for the detection
of Hg2+ at various pH values from acidic to basic in 10.0
mM Tris-buffer was recorded by the absorption spectroscopy study of
FPA (4) upon addition of Hg2+ salt (Figure S12A). The difference of the absorbance
intensity (A0 – A) of the receptor before and after the addition of Hg2+ ions against different pH values was plotted in Figure S12B, which indicates that the receptor is capable
of detecting Hg2+ in the range of pH 2–8 and the
highest difference of the absorbance intensities is detected at pH
4.0.

4 Binding Constant and Limit of Detection
To get a further insight into the sensing properties of FPA, a
quantitative investigation of the binding affinity of the sensor to
Hg2+ ions was carried out by absorption and fluorometric
titration. The absorption spectrum of FPA (4) (25.0 μM)
in water was recorded during the titration with various concentrations
of [Hg2+] (0–40.0 μM) (Figure 4A). The linearity of detection and lower
limit of detection (LOD) for Hg2+ are calculated by plotting
a graph of A0 – A at 460 nm against different concentrations of Hg2+ ions
in Figures 4B and S13. A linear response of the absorbance (A460) intensity as a function of [Hg2+] was detected from 1.75 to 20.0 μM (R2 = 0.9869) at 460 nm and the LOD of FPA toward Hg2+ is 1.65 μM. The binding constant (Kb) was calculated from the intercept and slope of the straight line
of the plot of 1/(A0 – A) against 1/[Hg2+] at 460 nm following the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation; it exhibits linearity in the range 2.7 × 104 to 5.7 × 104 M–1 (R2 = 0.9971) (Figure S14) assuming
a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. The estimated value was found to be Kb = 1.7 × 104 M–1 for the FPA–Hg2+ complex, indicating the strong
binding of Hg2+ with FPA in water.

Figure 4 (A) Absorption titration
spectra of FPA (4) (25.0
μM) upon the addition of different amounts of Hg2+ ions (0.01–5.0 equiv) in water. (B) A plot of the difference
of intensity of absorbance (A0 – A) upon addition of different amounts of Hg2+ ions (0–40.0 μM) in FPA at 460 nm.

Further studies to strengthen the strong interaction of mercury
ions with FPA, the LOD was measured through fluorometric titration
with different concentrations of Hg2+ ions (0.01–10.0
equiv) against the receptor 10.0 μM FPA in water (Figure 5A). The LOD of FPA for the
Hg2+ was determined to be 0.34 μM by plotting the
change of intensity F0 – F at 517 nm against [Hg2+]. Reasonable linearity
of the curve was found in the range of 0.10–4.0 μM Hg2+ ion concentration in water (Figure 5B,C). The LOD of FPA for Hg2+ in
fluorometric titration is 3.7 times lower than the value determined
by the absorption titration method. On a serious note, a LOD of this
sensor in fluorometric titration is found to be superior compared
to that of many reported receptors, which are not even able to detect
Hg2+ in the pure aqueous medium (Table S2). In this context, the receptor FPA (4) is
highly proficient for the colourimetric and fluorometric detection
of Hg2+ in an aqueous medium.

μM) with Hg2+ (0.1–60.0 μM) in water

sensitivity. (B) Difference of fluorescence intensities (F0 – F) at 517 nm upon addition
of different amounts of Hg2+ ions. (C) Linear curve for
LOD determination.

The detection ability
for Hg2+ was assessed by the fluorescence
quenching of FPA with mercury ions at 517 nm upon addition of various
concentrations of Hg2+ ions in water, and the quenching
constant Ksv was calculated using the
Stern–Volmer equation.  F0 and F represent the
steady-state fluorescence intensities of
the fluorophore of FPA in the absence and presence of the quencher
Hg2+, respectively. [Q] is the concentration of the fluorescence
quencher and Ksv is the quenching constant.
The rate of fluorescence quenching increased with an increase in the
Hg2+ ion concentration. Figure S15 shows a linear relationship between the rate of fluorescence quenching
upon increasing the concentration of Hg2+. In the range
from 10 to 60.0 μM, it follows the regression equation Y = 0.2206X + 0.4873 with a correlation
coefficient R2 = 0.9995 (Figure S15) where X is the concentration
of Hg2+, and Y is the rate of fluorescence
quenching. The quenching constant calculated for Hg2+ is Ksv= 2.0 × 105 M–1. This study suggested that the quenching of the fluorescence
intensity of FPA by Hg2+ follows a static quenching pathway.

5 Binding Stoichiometry and the Binding Site
The complexation
mode between FPA and Hg2+ ions in water
was determined by Job’s titration method using absorption spectroscopy
at 460 nm with a varying mole fraction of FPA (4) and
Hg2+ ions. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that the binding stoichiometry
of mercury ions to the receptor is in the ratio of 1:1. This FPA–Hg2+ complexation mode was further strengthened using the HRMS
(ESI-TOF) spectrum (Figure S16a) wherein
a characteristic peak at 496.1751 m/z corresponding to [FPA + 3H]+ and a peak at 714.3174 m/z upon addition of Hg2+ appeared
for [FPA + Hg2+ + H2O + H]+. This
study again confirms the 1:1 mercury ion to FPA binding in FPA–Hg2+ complexation.

Figure 6 Job’s plot of FPA–Hg2+ at 460 nm in an
aq. medium.

To find out the binding sites
of FPA in complexation with Hg2+ ions, NMR analysis was
set out in the presence and absence
of Hg2+ ions (Figure S17). The
host–guest interaction between FPA and Hg2+ ions
was studied through 1H NMR titrations of FPA in DMSO-d6 with the addition of mercury ions as the perchlorate
salt in different (0.5–3.0 equiv) concentrations to FPA. It
has been observed that the signals corresponding to phenolic and aliphatic
−OH of the fluorescein core and the l-phenylalaninol
segment of FPA at δ 14.92 and 5.11 ppm, respectively, disappeared
upon the addition of Hg2+ salt, while the signals of the
remaining phenolic protons and the imine functionality (CH=N−)
shifted toward downfield at δ 12.78 and 10.21 ppm, respectively,
with reduced intensity and broadening of the NMR peaks. Hence, the
significant changes observed at the position of phenolic −OH
of the fluorescein ring and the −OH associated with l-phenylalaninol are assumed to engage in the formation of the complex
with Hg2+ ions (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Proposed Binding of Hg2+ Ions to FPA (4)
6 Real-Time
Sensing of Mercury Ions
6.1 FPA-Containing Paper-Strip
Sensor
One of the expeditious and economical methods of sensing
metal ions
is the construction of a paper-strip sensor. The paper-strip sensor
of FPA was prepared to enhance the sensing ability for real-time sensing
of mercury ions. This approach might be beneficial for the effective
detection of Hg2+ under various experimental conditions.
Herein, the prepared strip was coated with FPA, dried and exposed
to Hg2+ ions in the solid, solution, and vapor states and
a color change of the paper-strip sensor was observed (Figure 7A). Upon exposure to mercury
ions, the paper strip rapidly changes the color from light yellow
to yellow in visible light; from green to dark green in absorbance,
and greenish-yellow to dark blue under fluorescence light (Figure 7B,C). The constructed
paper strip sensor provides rapid and straightforward detection of
mercury ions in all three states.

Figure 7 Images of the paper-strip in visible (A),
UV (B), and fluorescent
light (C) upon exposure to mercury ions in solid, solution, and vapor
phases. (D) Images of the color transition of FPA-containing paper-strip
in water at different concentrations of mercury ions under fluorescence
light.

Such a paper-based sensor was
further applied to find the LOD for
Hg2+ ion detection in aqueous solution. The images obtained
upon dipping the paper strip in different concentrations of Hg2+ ion solutions from 10–2 to 10–6 M are illustrated in Figure 7D. The FPA is found to be effective for the detection of Hg2+ ions in water up to 10–5 M concentration.
A comparison of the paper-based sensing studies is provided (Table S3).

6.2 Detection
of Hg2+ Ions in IEs
The receptor was applied to
detect Hg2+ in IEs to find
its broad applicability in real-time sensing. The absorption spectrum
of FPA at pH 5.0 in the IEs was recorded before and after the addition
of a known amount of Hg2+, and the outcome is demonstrated
in Figure 8. The FPA
selectively detects the spiked mercury ions in IEs, and the LOD was
calculated for Hg2+ ion detection in IEs by plotting the
difference of absorbance intensities A0 – A at 460 nm (Figure S18), and it is found to be 41.8 μM at pH 5.0.

Figure 8 Absorbance
spectra of FPA (4) upon addition of IE
and spiking of Hg2+ ions into IEs.

6.3 Removal Study of the Metal Ions by ICP
Capacity for the removal of mercury ions by FPA was confirmed by
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis in water.24,25 In order to assess the ability of the sensor for sensing Hg2+ ions in water, 0.01–10.0 ppm (or 2.5–250.0
μM) solution of Hg(ClO4)2 salt was gradually
added to the 25.0 μM FPA solution and allowed to settle or precipitate
out as the FPA–Hg2+ complex for 24 h (Figure 9). The supernatant of the mixture
(5.0 mL) was used for ICP analysis. From the concentration of the
Hg2+ ions in the stock solution and the concentration of
Hg2+ ions obtained after precipitation (Table 1), it is demonstrated that the
mercury ion concentration is reduced in stoichiometric ratio as compared
to the stock solution. Thus, this probe finds an excellent application
for the removal of Hg2+ ions from water and IEs.

24 h at different mercury ion concentrations.

A bar graph of Hg2+ ion removal in percentage is plotted

concentration in the equivalent ratio shown in Figure 10. The removal efficiency (∼98%) of
the mercury ions was achieved in the presence of 2.0 equiv of FPA
respective to the mercury ion concentration. FPA also successfully
eliminates the mercury ions present in IEs efficiently and at a 0.5
equiv concentration of Hg2+ to the receptor and 81.5% removal
of the mercury ions were observed. A comparison of the detection of
mercury ions with literature data has been provided (Table S2).

7 Conclusions
A mechanochemical high-yielding
synthesis of an FPA receptor with
ease of working and purification has been developed successfully.
The fundamental physicochemical behavior, that is, the solubility
and pH effect, was studied by absorption spectroscopy. The synthesized
receptor acted as a colorimetric and fluorometric sensor for the simultaneous
detection and removal of toxic mercury ions in aqueous solution. In
colourimetry, the FPA detected mercury ions by changing the color
from fluorescent green to light pink, while it quenched the fluorescence
intensity of FPA in the fluorometric study. The LODs of FPA for Hg2+ ions are 1.65 μM and 0.34 μM calculated by absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. The binding constant
is calculated by an absorption study and found to be Kb = 1.7 × 104 M–1. The
receptor FPA is capable of removing ∼98% mercury ions in the
presence of 2.0 equiv of the receptor to mercury ions from IEs applying
the ICP technique. The sensor is also advantageous to detect mercury
ions using the simple paper-strip movable technique. Therefore, the
receptor FPA may constitute a simple and inexpensive chemodosimeter,
which could demonstrate a highly viable and useful application for
the detection and effective removal of mercury ions from an aqueous
environment and IEs.

8.4.3 Solution Preparation for Solubility, Solvent,
and pH Effect
A stock solution of 1 × 10–2 M concentration of FPA (4) (4.9 mg, 10.0 mmol) in DMSO
(1.0 mL) was prepared, and from there 10.0 μL solutions from
the stock solution was diluted with different pH solutions (2.0 mL)
to make the final concentration 50 × 10–6 M.
The absorption spectra were recorded at rt without giving any incubation
time. For the pH study, 2.0 μL solutions were diluted with various
solvents (2.0 mL) to prepare the final concentration 10 × 10–6 M. The absorption spectroscopic data were recorded
at rt after incubating for 1 h.

8.4.4 Solution
Preparation for Absorbance and
Emission Study
It is to be mentioned that, in this work,
the absorbance and fluorescence spectra were analysed at room temperature
without giving any incubation time, unless otherwise indicated.

From the prepared stock solution of FPA, 250.0 μL solutions
were taken out and diluted with 50.0 mL of water to achieve a final
concentration of 50.0 μM for absorption spectroscopy. Similarly,
for fluorescence study, 50.0 μL was taken out from a stock solution
of FPA and diluted with 50.0 mL of water to make the final concentration
10.0 μM. The aqueous solutions of anions and cations with a
concentration of 1 × 10–2 M were prepared from
their respective perchlorate (alkali alkaline earth and transition
metals) or nitrate salts (lanthanide metals).

For ion selectivity
study, the stock solution of cations was prepared
in 2.5 × 10–4 M concentration. The salt solutions
(1.5 mL) were added to the FPA solution (1.5 mL) to adjust the 5:1
(ion/receptor) ratio for scanning of various ions. For emission study,
the salt solutions (1.5 mL) were added to the receptor FPA solution
(1.5 mL) to prepare the 10:1 (ion/receptor) ratio for scanning of
various ions.

8.4.5 LOD Determination
To determine
the LOD for strongly interacting cations (Hg2+ ions), the
absorbance titration was performed by adding an incremental amount
of mercury ions of known concentrations from 0.1 to 5.0 equiv into
25.0 μM aqueous FPA solution. To determine LOD, the fluorescence
titration was performed by adding an incremental amount of mercury
ions of known concentrations from 0.01 to 15.0 equiv into the 5.0
μM aqueous FPA solution.

8.4.6 Job
Plot Measurements
The same
concentration of the receptor FPA and Hg2+ ions (50 ×
10–6 M) was prepared in water. The different volumes
(3000–300) × 10–6 L of FPA were transferred
into vials and made up with the equal concentration of Hg2+ ion solution to prepare a total volume of 3.0 mL and a mole fraction
ratio of Hg2+ ions from 0 to 0.90.

8.4.7 Mass Spectroscopy
HRMS (ESI-TOF)] m/z: [FPA + Hg2+ + H2O + H+], 714.1416; calcd, 714.3174; C30H23ClHgNO6, 730.0927, calcd, 730.0920 (Figure S16a).

In LCMS (m/z): [FPA-benzyl group + Hg2+ + 2H2O], 640.0517;
calcd, 640.0884; [FPA + Hg2+ + 2OH– –
H+], 728.1855, calcd, 728.1197
(Figure S16b).

8.4.8 1H NMR Titration of FPA with
Hg2+ Ion
FPA (4) (5 × 10–3 M) was dissolved in DMSO-d6 (0.50 mL). The 2.5 μL of 0.50 M Hg(ClO4)2 solution in DMSO-d6 was added incrementally
into 5 × 10–3 M solution of FPA to prepare
the concentration of Hg2+ ions in an NMR tube ranging from
0.5 to 3.0 equiv with respect to FPA. After shaking them for a minute,
their 1H NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature.

8.4.9 Hg2+ Ion Detection at Different
pH values
From the stock solution of FPA (1 × 10–2 M), 50.0 μL was taken out and diluted with
10.0 mL of solution of respective pH to prepare final concentration
50.0 μM. The FPA (1.5 mL) solution was diluted with the same
pH solution and incubated for 1.0 h, and the absorption spectra were
measured. From the 1 × 10–2 M Hg2+ ion stock solution, 250.0 μL of solutions were taken out and
diluted with 10.0 mL of solution of respective pH to prepare final
concentration 250.0 μM. The 1.5 mL of the prepared Hg2+ solution was added to the 1.5 mL FPA (50.0 μL) solution and
absorption spectra were recorded.

8.5 Detection
of Hg2+ in IEs
8.5.1 Solution Preparation
of IE
IE was
collected from the Vapi industrial effluent plant, Gujarat, India.
The collected sample was filtered, and the pH of the effluent was
measured and found to be basic (pH 8). The collected IE was acidified
with HCl to maintain the acidic pH 5 to measure the mercury ion concentration.
The IE sample was diluted 10 times for further use at pH 5.0.

8.5.2 Solution Preparation of FPA
FPA
(4) stock solutions (50.0 μM) were prepared at
pH 5 in Millipore water.

8.5.3 Absorbance Study of IE
The FPA
solution (50.0 μM, 1.0 mL) was taken into a vial and a blank
solution of pH 5 (1.0 mL) was added to make the final concentration
25.0 μM. The absorbance spectra of the receptor solution were
measured. To measure absorbance response of receptor upon addition
of IE, the same FPA solution (50.0 μM, 1.0 mL) was taken into
the vial and IE (1.0 mL) was added to it, and absorbance spectra were
recorded. To study the linearity and LOD of Hg2+ ion detection,
the spiking IE was prepared with different concentrations of Hg2+, and absorbance spectra of these solutions were measured
by adding IE (1.0 mL) to FPA solution (1.0 mL) at pH 5.
