Hierarchically
porous Ce/TiO2/graphitic carbon microsphere composites
(xCe/TiO2/GCM, where x = 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 mmol·L–1) were prepared
for the first time by using a simple colloidal crystal template and
characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption and desorption,
scanning electron microscopy, and ultraviolet–visible diffuse
reflectance spectra. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction by H2O under simulated solar irradiation
was studied. The results showed that the Ce/TiO2/GCM composite
material was characterized by large porosity, high concentration of
metal compounds and graphitized carbon matrix, and the content of
acetone solvent having a great impact on its form. In terms of the
photocatalytic CO2 reaction, the CH4 and CO
productions were 4.587 and 357.851 μmol·g–1, respectively. The 2Ce/TiO2/GCM photocatalyst gave the
highest production rate for three products. Under simulated solar
irradiation, the Ce/TiO2/GCM has excellent photocatalytic
activity in the photoreduction of CO2 from H2O, which was related to the special composition and the Ce/TiO2/GCM structure.

==== Body
Introduction
The problem of climate change and global
warming caused by excessive CO2 discharges is becoming
increasingly serious1−5 but, unfortunately, the future exhaustion of fossil fuel resources
is also worrying.6−8 An ideal solution to global warming and the carbon
cycle in nature is to reap solar energy to convert photocatalytic
CO2 into renewable hydrocarbon fuels using H2O. For this purpose,9−15 researchers have attempted to develop efficient technologies such
as high-performance catalysts.

The preparation methods of composite
photocatalysts include chemical reduction,16−18 light-induced
reduction, photodeposition, thermal decomposition, liquid impregnation,
sol–gel, and hydrothermal method. Photocatalysts synthesized
by various methods have effective photocatalytic properties, which
provide broad prospects for applications in the fields of optical
computation,19 solar cells, photocatalysis,
and communication. For instance, the photocatalysts of Ce4+ and TiO2 were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation
peptization and hydrothermal and hydrolysis methods, respectively,
in Xie20 and effectively improved the photocatalytic
performances through Ce4+–TiO2 sol and
nanocrystallites. The photocatalytic solar fuel of TiO2 photonic crystal prepared by anodizing and calcining without a template
has the characteristics of slow photon and local surface photothermal
effect21 as well as improvement in the
catalytic reaction rate and light utilization, respectively. Using
ionic liquid as a template, mesoporous palladium-doped TiO2 with an anatase phase and a high specific surface area was synthesized
by the green sol–gel method. At the same residence time, the
photodegradation performance of NOx (88%)
and CO (74%) was significantly better than that of IL-TiO2 (59 and 56%) without doping.22 Despite
some achievements in catalyst preparations, preparation methods still
have the disadvantages of cumbersomeness and high cost.

Herein,
we proposed a method for the convenient synthesis of layered porous
Ce/TiO2/graphitic carbon microspheres (xCe/TiO2/GCM, where x = 0.2, 1.0, 2.0,
and 5.0 mmol·L–1) via colloidal crystal templating.
The structural characteristics of the composites were analyzed by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption–desorption, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and ultraviolet–visible light diffuse
reflectance spectra. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 from H2O under simulated solar irradiation was
studied. The results showed that the induced Ce significantly improved
the photoactivity of the hierarchically porous TiO2/GCM.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of the Ce/TiO2/GCM
Composites
As shown in Figure 1, the colloidal crystal templating method for the synthesis
of hierarchically porous Ce/TiO2/GCM23,24 is actually much simpler than the traditional multistep synthesis
method.

Figure 1 Step diagram of preparing hierarchically porous Ce/TiO2/graphitic carbon microspheres by the colloidal crystal template
method.

The preparation flow chart is
shown in Figure 1.
Acetone, soybean oil, TiCl4, and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O were mixed under stirring to form a
stable microemulsion, which was then mixed with monodisperse SiO2 microspheres under stirring to form a suspension. After 3
days, acetone evaporated from the microemulsion droplets, and the
interaction between monodisperse SiO2 microspheres was
intensified to form colloidal superparticles of SiO2 microspheres.
Furthermore, the microemulsion with colloidal superparticles of SiO2 microspheres was placed in the tube furnace for carbonaceous
polymerization/graphitization heat treatment. With the gradual increase
of temperature, during the heat treatment process at 900 °C under
an Ar atmosphere, metallic crystals grew in situ and were embedded
into the graphitic carbon matrix. The hierarchically porous Ce/TiO2/GCM, which can be classified as colloidal superparticles,25,26 was formed after the removal of the SiO2 colloidal crystal
sphere template by the silica colloidal crystal ball template and
was incubated in sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature. Finally,
Ce/TiO2/GCM was synthesized as expected.

XRD of Ce/TiO2/GCM Composites
The formation of Ce/TiO2/GCM composites with different compositions was first proved by XRD
(Figure 2). The anatase
phase of TiO2 is observed for all photocatalysts. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 25, 48, 53, 55, and 63° correspond to the
(101), (200), (105), (211), and (204) crystal planes of the pure anatase
phase of TiO2, respectively. The peak of graphite carbon
at 25° (002) was overlapped by that of anatase at 25° (101)
in each composite.21,27

Figure 2 XRD patterns of Ce/TiO2/GCM
composite materials (illustrated by the energy-dispersive system (EDS)
spectrum of the 0.2Ce/TiO2/GCM composite).

The XRD signal of 0.2Ce/TiO2/GCM is even noisier
than the results. Since there were almost no peaks in the background
spectrum, none of the crystal information extracted from the above
complexes can be considered reliable. However, owing to the small
size of the nanoparticles it is difficult to track the evolution as
Ce concentration increases. Fortunately, the peaks of the anatase
Ce are strengthened with the increasing Ce content in the composites,
indicating that the increase of the crystal particle size, which is
well consistent with the EDS results in Figure 2 (inset: 0.2Ce/TiO2/GCM EDS spectrum).
For instance, the contents of Ce, C, O, and Ti in 0.2Ce/TiO2/GCM are 1.11, 5.08, 37.90, and 55.92 wt %, respectively.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption of the Ce/TiO2/GCM
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding
pore size distribution curves of the porous carbons are shown in Figure 3. All isotherms in Figure 3a show strong absorption
of N2 due to capillary condensation within the wide relative
pressure (P/P0) range
of 0.6–0.9, which suggests the existence of multiform pore
distributions.28,29 It is associated with the interparticle
voids to the small absorption at P/P0 of 0.9–0.99.30,31 Additionally,
as shown in Figure 3b, most of the pores are located at 3.8–12 and 21–175.1
nm, which proves the graded porosity of the composite materials. The
structural properties of all composites are shown in Table 1. The average diameter of graded
porous composites is 13.37 nm, and much larger Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas than the largest surface area of graphitic carbon
composites are reported by Cai32 (132–204
vs 52.3 m2·g–1). Among all composite
materials, the specific surface area of 2Ce/TiO2/GCM was
the highest, which is 204 m2·g–1. Thus, the Ce/TiO2/GCM composites have large specific
surface areas and advanced pore structures.

SEM Analysis
of Ce/TiO2/GCM Composites
With acetone (45 mL)
as the solvent, some representative SEM images are shown in Figure 4. Clearly, the microsphere
morphology of the monodisperse SiO2 template was copied
into the porous materials. Finally, the long period structure of the
colloidal crystal with the most valuable properties was left after
the original colloidal SiO2 particles were removed. The
long-term arrangement of layered porosity has led to potential applications
in emerging nanotechnologies, advanced coatings, and optical information
processing and storage, and other areas.33,34 This valuable feature was further verified by the N2 adsorption
test (Figure 3). The
diameters of Ce/TiO2/GCM composites are about 2 μm.

Photoreduction of CO2 under Simulated Solar Irradiation
We measured the
photocatalytic activity of xCe/TiO2/GCM
on the photoreduction of gas-phase CO2 under simulated
solar irradiation. Figure 5 shows the change rule of CH4 and CO products with
the irradiation time for all samples. The results showed that the
yields of all composites increased with the increase in the reaction
times. The synergistic effect of GCM and Ce significantly enhanced
the photocatalytic activity of the composite because the introduction
of Ce improves the electrical conductivity and light absorption of
TiO2/GCM.

Figure 5 Productions of (a) CH4 and (b) CO as functions
of overall irradiation time.

The solar fuel production rates increase with the Ce content increasing
from 0.2 to 2 mmol and then decrease (Figure 5a), which is similar but not identical to
the trend of the CO2 adsorption capacity.35−37 However, the activity decreases with a further increase of the Ce
content to 5 mmol, indicating that an appropriate Ce content is very
important to achieve the best photocatalytic activity. The yield is
lower compared with the Ce-free samples under the same conditions.
The yield maximizes to 4.59 μmol·g–1 at
the Ce content of 2 mmol.

Figure 5b shows the CO production rates of solar fuels. With
prolonging the irradiation time, 2Ce/TiO2/GCM showed a
strong catalytic performance. The CO yield maximizes to 359.85 μmol·g–1 in 2Ce/TiO2/GCM after 6 h of simulated
sun exposure. The optimum 2Ce/TiO2/GCM exhibited several
times higher CO evolution rate than pure TiO2 in this study
and NH-UiO–66 synthesized by Crake et al.38 The results show that the Ce content is the most important
factor to determine the optimal photocatalytic activity and a further
increase of the Ce content will slow down the photoreduction conversion
of CO2.

Mechanism of Photocatalytic Reduction of
CO2 with H2O
Solar energy is used to
realize the recycling reaction of CO2 and H2O, and its working principle is as follows:39−42 semiconductor materials with
a certain band gap width generate electron-photogenic holes (h+) and photogenic electrons (e–) during the
excitation by sunlight, which migrate to the semiconductor catalyst
as active sites with reduction and oxidation potential, respectively,43 and then react with CO2 and H2O adsorbed on the surface. Holes capture electrons in H2O and decompose them to form strongly oxidizing hydroxide
(HO•) and hydrogen ion (H+).44 Meanwhile, CO2, as an electron acceptor,
is reduced to strongly oxidized carbon dioxide anion radical (•CO2–), and the specific
process is shown in eqs 1, 2, 3, and 4.45 Then, •CO2– is further combined with hydrogen ions
and photogenic electrons to obtain hydrocarbons such as formaldehyde,
formic acid, methanol, or methane. The specific reaction process is
shown in Figure 6 1   2   3   4

Conclusions
Hierarchically
porous Ce/TiO2 graphitic microsphere carbon (GCM) composites
were prepared by simple colloidal crystal template using SiO2 colloidal crystals as the template and titanium tetrachloride as
the precursor of Ti. According to the XRD analysis, the Ce/TiO2/GCM composite material has hierarchical porosity, high pore
volume, large specific surface area and graphitic framework, and N2 sorption. The CH4 and CO yields are 4.587 and
357.851 μmol·g–1, respectively. In addition,
among the four samples, the specific surface area of 2Ce/TiO2/GCM was the highest, so they give the highest production rate for
two products. The excellent photocatalytic activity of Ce/TiO2/GCM in CO2 photoreduction with H2O
under simulated solar irradiation is attributed to the special
composition and structure.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Absolute
alcohol, acetone, ammonia, tetraethoxysilane, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, NaOH, and soybean oil were used as
raw materials.

Catalyst Preparation
Colloidal SiO2 microspheres were prepared with 0.31 mol·L–1 ammonia by Stöber’s method,46 except that the volume was increased by 10 times.

The hierarchically
porous Ce/TiO2/GCM was synthesized via colloidal crystal
templating. Typically, x mmol of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (x = 0.2, 1.0,
2.0 or 5.0), 5.0 g of soybean oil, and 10 mmol of TiCl4 were dissolved into 45 mL acetone, respectively. Then, 2.5 g of
SiO2 microspheres was added to the above mixed solution
and stirred for about half an hour to form a suspension. After aging
at room temperature for 3 days, the suspension carbonizes the precursor
for 4 h at 900 °C under an Ar flow rate in a tubular furnace.
The silica gel template was removed after multiple treatments with
a 2 mol·L–1 NaOH solution.

Catalyst Characterization
The XRD patterns were collected in the 1–2 θ mode
on a Rigaku D/Max2rB-II diffractometer (Cu K1 radiation, λ =
1.5406 Å) at 100 mA and 40 kV. SEM was performed on a Philips
XL-30 SEM device, and the acceleration voltage was 25 kV. The specific
surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. Pore size distributions were obtained from desorption
branches of the isotherms by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. The total pore volumes were estimated at a relative
pressure of 0.99.

Photocatalytic Performance Tests
The photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction with H2O was tested in a self-made device, as shown in Figure 7. The photocatalytic reaction
was carried out in a quartz glass reactor with a volume of 1500 mL.
The catalyst powder (0.10 g) was evenly dispersed on a stainless steel
omentum and placed in the middle of the photocatalytic reactor. A
glass filament soaked with 5.0 g of deionized water was placed at
the bottom of the reactor to keep the reactor saturated with water
vapor, and a Xe arc lamp (300 W) with a solar radiation spectrum was
placed 8 cm above the quartz window to illuminate the whole catalyst.
To control the reaction temperature at 30 °C, we placed the Xe
lamp in a cold trap to keep the whole reactor system in a state of
air circulation. Prior to ignition, the reactor was first cleaned
with a CO2 + H2O mixture at 100 mL·min–1 for 2 h, then at 20 mL·min–1 for another hour to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium;
the volume concentrations of CO2 and the H2O
gas phase were controlled at about 95.5 and 4.5%, respectively.47 The reactor was then sealed and the pressure
of CO2 was maintained at 110 kPa. After that, the light
source 300 W xenon lamp was turned on. GC 8000 Top gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry system was used to collect and analyze the gas-phase
products at different time points during the irradiation. Each sample
was injected 5 μm into the loop, and 25 m × 0.32 mm CP-PoraPLOT
Q-HT column (Chrompack) was injected via 0.5 m × 0.32 mm deactivated
precolumn, which was maintained at 23 °C. Helium at 2.0 mL·min–1 was used as the carrier gas.48,49 The mass spectrometer operates in a single-ion monitoring mode with
electron ionization (70 eV). The retention times of CH4 and CO were 1.6 and 2.3 min, respectively. The total detection time
of one sample was 3.3 min, which was enough for sample collection,
injection, chromatography, and data collection for 2.5 min.
