A new solvent scale,
solvation ability (SA), was developed to arrange
solvents in the order of their SA for large π-conjugated compounds.
The SA of a solvent was determined in a binary solvent system of an
assessed solvent and a standard “good” solvent (GS)
or “poor” solvent (PS), chloroform or methylcyclohexane,
respectively, in the presence of two types of solvation/desolvation
indicators, 1Zn2 and 2Zn2. The latter comprises bis(imidazolylporphyrinatozinc) linked
via a 1,3-butadiynylene moiety having linear alkyl and hydrophilic
side chains, respectively. GSs and PSs give extended (E-) and stacked
(S-) supramolecular polymers of the indicators, respectively. SA values
are defined as vol % of the standard solvent added to an assessed
solvent to give the balance point where comparable amounts of E- and
S-polymers of the indicators coexist. GSs and PSs have positive and
negative signs, respectively. In this study, the SA of 25 solvents
was determined. The SA values with indicator 1Zn2 were as follows: ethyl acetate (−81), hexane (−66),
toluene (−50), cyclohexane (−47), CCl4 (−25),
chloroform (50), and nitrobenzene (79).

1 Introduction
The
terms “solvent effect” and “solvent dependence”
appear frequently in the scientific literature. Most solvent effects
and solvent-dependent phenomena in chemical reactions involve the
solvation of starting materials and products, as well as the intermediates
and the transition states, resulting in changes in the energy landscapes,
which in turn control the equilibrium ratios, product yields, and
reaction rates. Solvation of solvents to the materials is sometimes
realized, and solvent-dependent phenomena have been explained by the
physical properties of solvents, such as the dielectric constant (ε),
refractive index (n), cohesive energy density (CED),
and an empirical solvent index, such as π*1 and ET(30),2 derived using solvatochromic compounds. In electron and
charge transfer systems, for example, polar solvents that have higher
dielectric constants can stabilize the charged materials. Solvation
of ions and polar compounds is also favored in polar solvents for
the same reason. In the majority of these cases, relatively strong
charge–dipole, dipole–dipole, and hydrogen bonding interactions
are the dominant contributors. In contrast, weak interactions, such
as arene–arene,3 arene–perfluoroarene,4 sulfur–arene,5 cation−π,6 and anion−π7,8 interactions, involving neutral and nonpolar or less-polar arenes
and π-conjugated compounds, are also important in biological
molecules, as well as in synthetic molecules and supramolecules.8−12 The weak interactions are affected by the solvent and peripheral
substituents.11−21 However, solvation of neutral and nonpolar or less-polar arenes
and the role of peripheral substituents on the arenes remain unclear.
This is because weak interactions among solvent molecules, arenes,
and peripheral substituents are related, as in a many-body problem,
but they are obscured by other strong interactions.

Thus, no
existing method can measure the solvation ability (SA)/desolvation
ability of solvents toward neutral and nonpolar or less-polar arenes
separately from the other strong interactions.

Arene–arene
interaction, so-called π–π
interaction, is one of the most important nonbonding interactions
in supramolecular polymerization.11,22−26 Understanding the solvent dependence and substituent effect of the
π–π interaction is an important issue in science.
Therefore, creating a solvent scale for the π–π
interaction among neutral and nonpolar arenes is considered to be
useful for carrying out detailed studies of solvent dependencies on
π–π interactions.

One of the methods used
to prepare such a solvent scale is measuring
the abundance ratio between two solvent-dependent conformational isomers
in various solvents20,27−30 in which π–π
interactions are associated to form one of the isomers. Another method
is obtaining association constants of self-assembled dimer and polymer
systems through π–π interactions in various solvents.
From the association constant, the solvent-dependent Gibbs free energy
difference (ΔG) between the monomer and the
dimer (polymer) is determined.11,16,17,21,22,31

Although solvent-dependent ΔG values have
been reported for several dynamic systems, they are considered inadequate
in terms of the numbers and types of solvents assessed to study solvent
dependencies on π–π interactions systematically.
Here, we report a new method for measuring the SA of solvents by using
the solvation/desolvation indicators 1Zn2 and 2Zn2 (Figure 1) that we developed previously.32,33

2 Results
and Discussion
The indicators comprise bis(imidazolylporphyrinatozinc)
linked
via a 1,3-butadiynylene moiety. They form extended (E-) or stacked
(S-) polymers exclusively through two types of complementary coordination
bonds and π–π interactions among the porphyrin
units inside the S-polymer (Figure 2). The two types of coordination bonds are only weakly
solvent-dependent, whereas the π–π interactions
are highly solvent-dependent. Therefore, the solvent dependency of
the formation of E- or S-polymers can be applied to the creation of
a solvent scale for the π–π interaction. In this
system, any type of liquid/solvent (except for very strongly coordinating
to the zinc porphyrin moieties, such as pyridine) can be used with
a small amount of the indicator. Hence, many solvents/liquids of various
types can be indexed.

Figure 2 Equilibrium between extended (E-) and stacked (S-) polymers
comprising
bis(imidazolylporphyrinatozinc) molecules, 1Zn2 (R: undecyl), and 2Zn2 (R: TEGMe = 2,5,8,11-tetraoxatetradecan-14-yl).
Formation of E- or S-polymers depends on balances among solute–solute
interactions in both E- and S-polymers, solvent–solute, and
solvent–solvent interactions. Some interactions are illustrated
(Solv.: solvent).

In our system, it is
difficult to determine the energy differences
between E- and S-polymers in only one solvent as in most cases, only
E- or S-polymers are observed. Instead, a balance point could be created
by adding a GS to a PS or by adding a PS to a GS in which E- and S-polymers
exist in comparable amounts.

We noticed that the relative SA
of solvents could be determined
by comparing the ease with which the balance points could be prepared.
The method appears to resemble an acid/base titration using phenolphthalein
as an indicator. Interconversion between E- and S-polymers is illustrated
in Figure 3. Because
E- and S-polymers are formed exclusively in most solvents, the balance
point exists only under limited binary solvent conditions. Upon titration,
the balance point can be detected as a steep inflection point.

Figure 3 Schematic of
interconversion between E-polymer and S-polymer, achieved
by varying the solvent composition. A balance point exists under a
suitable composition of “good” and “poor”
solvents.

Titration is very convenient for
creating the balance point. However,
the final concentration of the balance point may vary depending on
the solvent used. To compare the SA of various solvents, the conditions
(e.g., concentration and temperature) must be held constant. We elected
to use the tournament style to measure the SA (Figure 4). In the experiments, the concentration
and temperature were regulated to 2.5 × 10–6 M and 298 K, respectively.

Figure 4 Tournament style used to determine the balance
points in various
solvents using solvation/desolvation indicators 1Zn2 and 2Zn2.

Various ratios of binary mixtures were prepared. The indicators
were dissolved therein to give the same concentrations. As standard
GSs and PSs, CHCl3 and methylcyclohexane (MCH) were selected,
respectively. These are well miscible with other solvents. To assess
PSs, CHCl3 was used, whereas methylcyclohexane was used
to assess GSs. Typical UV–vis spectral results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 UV–vis spectra
of 1Zn2 in various
binary mixtures of MeCN and CHCl3 (2.5 × 10–6 M, 298 K). MeCN:CHCl3 = (a) 50:50, (b) 25:75, (c) 21:79,
(d) 18:82, and (e) 13:87. Characteristic peaks of S- and E-polymers
are observed at 768 and 740 nm, respectively. The balance point coexisting
in the S- and E-dimers is (c) 21:79.

Here, CH3CN was assessed as a PS. The flow of the assessment
followed the tournament style (Figure 4). First, when a 50:50 v/v mixture of CH3CN and CHCl3 was used (Figure 5a), only S-polymer was observed as a characteristic
peak at 768 nm. Second, when a 25:75 mixture was used (Figure 5b), a trace amount of E-polymer
was observed as a shoulder signal at 740 nm. Third, when a 13:87 mixture
was used (Figure 5e),
only E-polymer was observed. Then, when an 18:82 mixture was used
(Figure 5d), only E-polymer
was observed. Finally, the balance point was determined to be 21:79
(Figure 5c) where almost
equal amounts of E- and S-polymers coexisted. It is noteworthy that
the balance point exists only in a narrow range of the binary mixtures.
This is because the formations of E- and S-polymers are exclusive
to each other. The inflection point between E- and S-polymers is very
steep and an accurate balance point was reached at 21:79 ± 3%.
Similar steep changes were observed in all other solvents assessed.

To combine the scales of solvation and desolvation, SA is defined
as follows. If CHCl3 is used as a GS to assess a PS, then
the sign of the SA of the assessed solvent is negative. In contrast,
if MCH is used as a PS to assess a GS, then the sign is positive.
The absolute values of the SA correspond to the vol % of the added
standard solvents. We can compare the SA values with ±5% accuracy,
except for p-xylene (±7%). In this study, 25
solvents were assessed. All their UV–vis spectra are shown
in Figures S1–S5. In Figure 6, the SA values for 1Zn2 are represented as bar graphs. The error bars indicate
the accuracy of the SA values.

K). (a) Polar nonaromatic
compounds, (b) nonpolar and nonaromatic compounds (alkanes), (c) benzene
and methylated benzenes, (d) chloro-organic compounds, (e) and functionalized
benzene. AcOEt: ethyl acetate; MeCN: acetonitrile; AcOBu: n-butyl acetate; DME: 1,2-dimethoxyethane; THF: tetrahydrofuran.
Standard GS: CHCl3; standard PS: MCH.

The solvents were classified into five groups: (a) polar nonaromatic
compounds, (b) nonpolar and nonaromatic compounds (alkanes), (c) benzene
and methylated benzenes, (d) chloro-organic compounds, and (e) functionalized
benzene. Because the number of solvents belonging to groups (d) and
(e) are currently limited, they are not discussed further. Except
for tetrahydrofuran (THF), group (a) solvents have large negative
SA values (−77.5 ± 3.5). Linear alkanes also have large
negative SA values (−64.5 ± 1.5) that do not depend on
their chain lengths between n-hexane and n-decane. Interestingly, cyclohexane and MCH have larger
SA values (−47 and – 50) than the linear alkanes. Nonpolar
benzene and methylated benzenes have negative SA values (−46
± 4), similar to those of the cyclohexanes, and the absolute
values are smaller than those of linear alkanes and polar nonaromatic
compounds, excluding THF.

In Figure 7, the
SA values of solvent groups (a)–(c) (excluding THF) for the
indicators 1Zn2 and 2Zn2 are compared as bar graphs. 1Zn2 and 2Zn2 have hydrophobic (undecyl) and hydrophilic
(TEGMe) side chains on their porphyrin skeletons, respectively. In
group (a) solvents, the side chain effect is clearly observed. The
absolute values of the negative SA decrease for 2Zn2 compared with those for 1Zn2. The
hydrophilic substituent groups (TEGMe) on 2Zn2 seem to promote solvation by polar solvents. In contrast, a smaller
substituent effect was observed for linear alkanes (group b), and
the SA of the cyclohexanes decreased in the case of 2Zn2. In group (c) solvents, although the substituent effect
was observed, no trend was observed in the direction and degree of
the difference between 1Zn2 and 2Zn2.

10–6 M, 298 K): (a) polar nonaromatic compounds,
(b) nonpolar, nonaromatic compounds, and (c) benzene and methylated
benzenes. Standard GS: CHCl3; standard PS: MCH.

Table S1 lists all SA values of
the
25 solvents obtained experimentally in this work, together with their
CEDs, empirical solvent scales (π* and ET(30)), refractive indexes (n), and dielectric
constants (ε). In Figures S6–S10, relationships between SA values and CED, π*, ET(30), n, and ε are plotted,
respectively. Overall, there was little relationship observed between
the SA values and the empirical solvation scales and physical properties
of solvents assessed, especially for group (a) solvents.

Würthner
and co-workers,16 Müllen
and co-workers,17 and Moore and co-workers11 have reported polymerization constants of perylene
bisimide derivatives 1–3,(16) hexabenzocoronene derivatives 4 and 5,(17) and phenylene ethynylene macrocycle
derivative 6,(11) respectively,
in three to eight different solvents. Here, all the polymers are assumed
to be self-assembled by isodesmic models. The relationships between
their reported polymerization energies and the SA values obtained
in this study are plotted in Figures 8–10 and Figures S11–S13 (data tabulated
in Tables 1–3 and Tables S2–S4). Although only a few solvents were used, relatively
good correlations were obtained. Thus, a solvent having a larger negative
SA tends to give a larger negative ΔG of polymer
formation. These results suggest that the SA values obtained in this
work offer one of the solvent scales to estimate π–π
interaction between large π-conjugated compounds.

3 Conclusions
We successfully constructed
a new solvent scale, SA, using the
solvation/desolvation indicators 1Zn2 and 2Zn2. SA values are defined as vol % of a standard
solvent added to an assessed solvent to give the balance point where
comparable amounts of E- and S-polymers of the indicators coexist.
As the SA values for samples were collected at the same concentrations
and temperatures, the values can be directly compared. Although there
was little correlation between SA values and the empirical solvent
scales (reported previously) and physical solvent properties, SA and
polymerization constants of large π-conjugated compounds seemed
to be correlated. As the method is applicable to any solvent/liquid
material, extensive data on SA values can be collected. Such data
will be useful for studying the solvation and desolvation of large
π-conjugated compounds.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Procedure
All chemicals and
solvents were of commercial reagent quality and used without further
purification unless otherwise stated. CHCl3 (Kanto, extra
pure) stabilized with 0.5–1% ethanol was used. UV–vis
absorption spectra were collected on a JASCO V-660 spectrometer at
298 K.

4.2 UV–Vis Titration
An aliquot
(30 μL) of a 2.5 × 10–4 M chloroform
solution of 1Zn2 or 2Zn2 was added to 3 mL of mixtures of chloroform and “poor”
solvents to be assessed or MCH and “good” solvents to
be assessed. The UV–vis spectra were recorded as shown in Figures S1–S5.
