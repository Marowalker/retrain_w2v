As
supercapacitor electrode materials, their structures, including
specific surface area, instability, and interconnection, determine
the electrochemical performances (specific capacitance, cycle stability,
and rate performance). In this study, 1T-MoS2 nanosheets
were self-assembled into nanoflowers via a one-pot facile hydrothermal
reaction. The nanoflowers retain the excellent electrical conductive
performance and the feature of inherent high specific surface area
of the nanosheets. For the sheets are interconnected to each other
in flower structure, the structure is more stable and the charges
are more easily transferred. Thus, compared to the nanosheet electrode,
the nanoflower electrode shows the remarkable advantage when used
as the electrode of the energy-storage device, whether it is 1T phase
or 2H phase in KCl or in KOH. When measured at 0.5 A g–1 in KOH electrolyte, the MoS2 nanoflower electrode exhibits
a high specific capacitance of 1120 F g–1. At the
same time, when cycling 2000 times at a current density of 10 A g–1, the capacitance retention ratio can reach up to
96%.

1 Introduction
Supercapacitors
have been attracting much scientific and technical
interest owing to their advantages of high charge/discharge rate,
excellent cycle stability, and outstanding energy density compared
to traditional electrochemical energy-accumulation devices like dielectric
capacitors and batteries,1 which are regarded
as the inevitable part in addressing the shortage of energy and environmental
problems along with fossil energy.2,3 The leading
challenge toward practical application is to improve the economics,
societal acceptance, and energy density of current supercapacitors.
Meanwhile, their native features of excellent power density and cyclic
stability are maintained.4 As a result,
many researchers devoted efforts to eco-efficient, environmentally
friendly, and crust-rich element-based electrodes, such as Fe-, Mn-,
C-, and S-containing electrodes,5−11 instead of the rare and precious metal-containing electrodes, such
as Ru and Pt, and toxic Ni- and Co-containing electrodes.12−17 After porous structure optimization, morphology control, and surface
modification, carbon materials currently can alone exhibit a specific
capacitance as high as 473 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 with a mass loading of 3 mg cm–2.18 The high capacitance basically originates
from the charge accumulation at the interface between the electrode
and the electrolyte as electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs),
as well as the faradic redox reaction on the doped heteroatom (mainly
N and O) as pseudocapacitance.19 Nanostructured
MnO2–carbon nanotube–sponge hybrid electrodes
have been synthesized successfully by Chen and colleagues.20 At 1 mV s–1, the electrode
possesses a high specific capacitance of 1230 F g–1 (based on the mass of MnO2) with a lower mass loading
of less than 0.1 mg cm–2. After cycling 100 000
times at 10 V s–1, they show the excellent cyclic
stability with the capacitance retention ratio of 98%, which indicates
that MnO2 is a competitive alternative to RuO2 in future capacitors. Studies on other naturally abundant alternative
materials, such as MoS2, TiO2, Fe2O3, V2O5, polyaniline, polythiophene,
polypyrrole, and their derivatives, have also undergone great breakthroughs.21−25

For the sake of enhancing the electrochemical energy-storage
capacity
of a capacitor, it is not enough only to handle the electrode materials,
although it is the main factor and we have also gained a lot by optimizing
its structure, morphology, and surface.26−28 Increasingly more researchers
treat all electrode components, including electrode materials and
current collectors, as a whole to make the electrochemical performances
better. It is widely accepted that the assembly configuration of these
components heavily determines the performances of the capacitors.
Many kinds of advanced nanostructured electrode materials, including
nanosheets, nanorods and nanowires, are directly grown on the metal
foam current collectors to integrate the electrodes and reduce the
entire internal resistance of the cell.29−35 Layered MoS2–graphene material is fabricated successfully
via a modified solution-phase method.36 The electrode possesses a maximum specific capacitance of 243 F
g–1 at 1 A g–1. At the same time,
the energy density and power density are 73.5 Wh kg–1 and 19.8 kW kg–1, respectively. Fast supercapacitors
were perpared using binder-free electrodes of MoS2 nanosheets
grown on plasma pyrolyzed cellulose microfiber paper.37 The electrodes can possess a power density of 12.05 W cm
g–3 at 15 V s–1 in organic electrolyte.
The MoS2 nanosheets and carbon cloth composite was synthesized
by a traditional hydrothermal process. The electrode can reach up
to the high specific capacitance of 151.1 F g–1 and
possess outstanding capacitance retain ratio of 86.1% after 2000 cycles.38 The MoS2/Bi2S3 composite electrode was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal way.
It reaches a high specific capacitance of up to 120 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 and capacitance retention ratio of
87.7% after 2000 cycles.39 Carbon–MoS2 yolk–shell microsphere electrode was synthesized via
a simple hydrothermal method possess. It can reach up to the high
specific capacitance of 122.6 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 and energy density of 17.03 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 500.1 W kg–1.40 The three-dimensional flowerlike MoS2 nanosheets and two-dimensional interconnected carbon nanosheet nanocomposite
was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal way. It reaches a specific
capacitance of up to 381 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 and an outstanding capacitance retention ratio of 92% after 3000
cycles in KOH electrolyte.41 MoS2/CNT nanocomposite was prepared via a simple hydrothermal method.
It shows the specific capacitance of 74.05 F g–1 at 2 A g–1. At the same time, the electrode possesses
the high capacitance retain ratio of 80.8% after 1000 cycles.42 The Ag NPs/MoS2 nanocomposites prepared
by a self-assembly method show excellent electrochemical performances.43

In this paper, we will report that besides
nanostructuring to increase
the accessible interface, self-assembly of these nanostructured materials
into a firm structure is also beneficial for improving the electrochemical
performances of a supercapacitor electrode. The assembly can enhance
the probability that the nanostructured electrode materials are active
and conductive to the collector and reduce the internal resistance.
Because the pasting method can be further used on the self-assembled
nanostructured materials to prepare electrodes, a large mass loading
of active materials can be achieved. As a proof of concept, MoS2 nanosheets, including both 1T and 2H phase, were self-assembled
into nanoflowers by the help of NaCl additive. After assembly, the
specific capacitance of the nanoflowers increased significantly from
135 to 316 F g–1 in 3 M KCl electrolyte at 10 A
g–1. As the battery-type charge storage mode can
be activated in alkaline electrolytes, the specific capacitance of
the 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers could reach up to 1120 F g–1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte at 0.5 A g–1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
The prepared products were first observed
through a field emission scanning electron microscope, and the typical
photographs are exhibited in Figure 1. In Figure 1a–c, without addition of NaCl, we obtained millions
of wrinkled MoS2 nanosheets that possess a diameter of
120 nm and thickness of 2.6 nm. They are cluttered together, leaving
millions of voids among them because of the wrinkled structure.

Figure 1 FESEM images
of MoS2 nanosheets (a–c) and MoS2 nanoflowers
(d–f) at different magnifications.

The NaCl additive can change the product morphology dramatically,
as shown in Figure 1d–f. Although MoS2 nanosheets with similar size
can also be observed in the product, they are assembled into individual
spherical particles with a diameter of ∼800 nm, which seem
like rose flowers. The nanosheets are like petals. The self-assembly
process of the nanosheets can also be confirmed by the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2a, the TEM image of the product without NaCl shows
a relative evenly distributed mass-density contrast, which indicates
randomly scattered nanosheets.

Figure 2 TEM images of MoS2 nanosheets
(a) and MoS2 nanoflowers (c) (inset: the corresponding
selected area electron
diffraction patterns); (b, d) the corresponding high-resolution TEM
images.

The dark lines correspond to the
wrinkles of the sheets. However,
in Figure 2c, the TEM
image of the product with NaCl includes several radial mass-density
contrast zones where the darkness gradually decays from the center
to outside. The kind of mass-density contrast image is consistent
with the spherical rose flower morphology observed by FESEM in Figure 1d–f. Of course,
the nanosheet components can also be clearly observed especially in
the edge area.

However, the addition of NaCl in the solution
doesn’t change
their crystallography and phase any more. As shown in Figure 2b and d, both the MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2 nanoflowers show identical spacing
of interference fringe and identical diameters of the Debye–Scherrer
ring, which indicates they have an identical crystallographic structure.
That is further confirmed by their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
shown in Figure S1. They possess a similar
XRD pattern in the 2θ range of 5–80°. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 14.1, 32.9, 35.9, 39.5, and 58.8° could be
unambiguously assigned to the (002), (100), (102), (103), and (110)
crystal planes of JCPDS card #37-1492, respectively.44 The phase structures were investigated by Raman spectroscopy
that is an effective means to differentiate 1T-MoS2 and
2H-MoS2 on account of its sensitivity to the symmetry of
the sulfur in the matrix.45,46 As shown in Figure 3a, we see obvious
Raman shifts of both spectra at 146, 219, and 333 cm–1, which coincided with the phonon modes in 1T-MoS2 and
depressed typical Raman shifts at 378.3 and 401.1 cm–1 for 1E2g and A1g of 2H-MoS2, respectively.4747

Figure 3 (a) Raman spectra of MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images of MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets: (b) survey spectra;
(c) high-resolution XPS images from Mo 3d region of MoS2 nanoflowers; (d) high-resolution XPS images from Mo 3d region of
MoS2 nanosheets. Contributions from 1T and 2H phase components
in the Mo 3d spectrum and S 2s spectrum are distinguished through
the blue and green curves, separately.

It implies that both the MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets contain two components: 1T and 2H phase MoS2. Calculated through the Raman shift difference between A1g and 1E2g modes, we obtained the amount
of the monolayers of MoS2 nanosheets. It is the same in
both samples, about 22.8 and 24.3 cm–1, corresponding
to three and four monolayers.48,49 The phase compositions
were further identified by XPS. The XPS survey spectra of MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets are exhibited
in Figure 3b. The spectra
are similar to each other, and both of them contain two predominant
Mo and S peaks. As is well known, the 1T phase could cause ∼1
eV chemical shift to lower binding energy on Mo 3d peaks and S 2p
peaks.50 The high-resolution XPS images
of Mo 3d peaks and S 2p peaks of each sample were further studied,
and the relevant spectra are exhibited in Figures 3c and d and S2, respectively. As shown in Figure 3c,d, the Mo4+ 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of MoS2 nanoflowers and those of MoS2 nanosheets are at the same binding energy position, which
are 228.2 and 231.3 eV, respectively. In fact, both the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks contain two parts. One is contributed
by 1T-MoS2 component located at 228.0 and 231.1 eV, and
the other one is contributed by the 2H-MoS2 component located
at 229.0 and 232.1 eV.51 So the high-resolution
X-ray photoelectron spectrum can be fitted by these two-component
peaks, and the component content can be calculated by the fitting
results. The relative content of the 1T phase in MoS2 nanoflowers
is about ∼78.0%, which is also comparable to that of MoS2 nanosheets (75.3%). The multiple peaks fitting results in
S 2p peaks in Figure S2 are also consistent
with this conclusion. On the basis of N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms, as displayed in Figure S3, the
self-assembly process did not even change the specific surface area
of the sample. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area of the nanoflowers is about 54.7 m2 g–1, which is slightly lower compared to that of the nanosheets (59.8
m2 g–1).

On account of all of the
characterization results, it could be
summarized that the addition of NaCl in the solution only changes
the nucleation mechanism and does not affect the growth. After hydrothermal
reaction, the solution and the autoclave wall are carefully observed
by the naked eye. As shown in Figure S4, this solution with NaCl is very clear and the corresponding autoclave
is covered by a thick layer of black product. To collect the product,
a chemical spoon was used to peel them from the wall. However, as
none of NaCl is added in the hydrothermal reaction solution, most
of the product is suspended in the solution after reaction. And the
autoclave wall also becomes cleaner. We speculate that the nanosheets
are generated from homogeneous nucleation. Each sheet grows from an
unattached nucleus away from a surface. After adding NaCl in the solution,
homogeneous nucleation becomes even harder. Most of nanosheets have
to nucleate on the nucleus at the wall. For many sheets shear one
nucleus, the nanosheets are self-assembled to a spherical rose flower.
In the following electrochemical testing, it will be found that the
self-assembly unites the sheet together. So every nanosheet is interconnected.
After pasted on the collector, they have high probability to connect
with the current collector and keep active. Thus, the self-assembly
process significantly improves the electrochemical performances of
the electrode materials.

2.2 Electrochemical Analysis
The electrochemical performances
of the MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes
with mass loading of 2 mg cm–2 as supercapacitor
were measured through cyclic voltammogram (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements
with three-electrode equipment, which consists of saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) and Pt plate as the reference and counter electrodes,
separately. The typical CV curves of MoS2 nanoflowers and
MoS2 nanosheets measured at 20 mV s–1 in the potential window of −1.05 to −0.3 V in 3 M
KCl electrolyte are exhibited in Figure 4a. Apparently, all obtained CV curves in
KCl present a typical horizontal straight line without any obvious
redox peaks. It implies that MoS2 can act as an EDLC and
store charge by adsorbing them on the electrode–electrolyte
interface.52 However, the CV curve encircled
area of MoS2 nanoflowers is dramatically enlarged compared
to that of MoS2 nanosheets, which means a higher specific
capacitance of MoS2 nanoflowers. CV curves of MoS2 nanoflowers at different scan rates (Figure 4b) retain their quasi-rectangular shapes
as scan rates increase from 5 to 200 mV s–1. The
specific capacitance of MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes was further confirmed through GCD measurement.
The typical GCD curves of the two electrodes at 10 A g–1 shown in Figure 4c present classical quasi-triangular shapes owing to the EDLC mechanism
of charge accumulation with voltage. At the same time, the MoS2 nanoflower electrode possesses a longer discharging time,
indicating a higher special capacitance than the MoS2 nanosheet
electrode, matching well with the results shown in the CV curves in Figure 4a. All of the GCD
curves of MoS2 nanoflower electrode at different current
densities are shown in Figure 4d. The calculated specific capacitances are summarized in Figure 4e. The MoS2 nanoflower electrode presents a high specific capacitance of 483
F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 in KCl. As
the current density increases 40 times to 20 A g–1, the electrode retains 305 F g–1 and obtains the
capacitance retain ratio of 62.3%. The specific capacitance retention
of the MoS2 nanosheet electrode is slightly higher, which
is about 71.2%. However, the specific capacitance is only 120 F g–1 at 20 A g–1, which is lower than
that of nanoflower electrode. The cyclability of both electrodes in
KCl electrolyte was measured at 10 A g–1 over 2000
cycles. The MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet
electrodes showed capacity ratios of 94% and 87% after 2000 cycles,
respectively, as shown in Figure 4f, implying the MoS2 nanoflower electrode
possesses excellent cycle stability.

MoS2 nanosheets at 20 mV s–1 in KCl;

rates; (c) comparison of GCD curves of MoS2 nanoflowers
and MoS2 nanosheets at 10 A g–1; (d)

In this work, we investigate
the electrochemical performances of
MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets in 3 M
KOH. The typical CV curves of MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets measured at 20 mV s–1 in a potential
window ranging from 0 to 0.75 V are exhibited in Figure 5a. Apparent reversible redox
peaks at 0.50/0.36 and 0.44/0.35 V are seen in both CV curves, which
suggest the battery-type charge storage mechanism. The area encircled
by the CV curve of MoS2 nanoflower electrode is dramatically
enlarged compared to the MoS2 nanosheet electrode, which
indicates that MoS2 nanoflower electrode possesses a higher
specific capacitance. The resulting CVs of the MoS2 nanoflower
and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes at different scan rates from
5 to 200 mV s–1 are exhibited in Figures 5b and S5a. The specific capacitance as a function of scan rate was
calculated from the obtained CV curves, as displayed in Figure S5b.

Figure 5 (a) Comparison of CV curves of MoS2 nanoflowers and
MoS2 nanosheets at 20 mV s–1 in KOH;
(b) CV curves of MoS2 nanoflowers at different scanning
rates; (c) comparison of GCD curves of MoS2 nanoflowers
and MoS2 nanosheets at 10 A g–1; (d)

of 0.5–20 A g–1; (e) specific capacitance
of MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes
at different current densities of 0.5–20 A g–1; and (f) cycling performance of MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes measured at 10 A g–1 for 2000 cycles.

It shows that the specific
capacitance of the MoS2 nanoflower
and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes decreases gradually with
increasing scan rate. It has been reported that water bilayers which
absorbed on MoS2 monolayers could take part in charge storage.
The charge storage mechanism is that the proton of water molecule
absorbed on MoS2 could enter the water bilayers when charging
in the alkaline electrolytes.53 Benefiting
from the battery-type charge storage, the specific capacitance of
both electrodes increases dramatically as they are tested in KOH contrary
to KCl. The specific capacitances of MoS2 nanoflowers and
MoS2 nanosheets are 1346 and 434 F g–1 at 5 mV s–1, respectively. However, when the scan
rate reaches up to 200 mV s–1, the specific capacitances
of MoS2 nanoflowers and MoS2 nanosheets are
642 and 209 F g–1, respectively.

The excellent
electrochemical performances reflected in CV experiment
could be verified by the GCD measurements in KOH. Figure 5c shows the comparative GCD
curves of MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet
electrodes at 10 A g–1, which further supports the
higher special capacitance of MoS2 nanoflower electrode
owing to its longer discharging time, matching well with the result
of the CV curves in Figure 5a. Meanwhile, all of the GCD curves display well-defined voltage
plateaus, indicating battery behavior and accordance with redox peaks
obtained from CV curves. In Figures 5d and S8, there are GCD
measurements on both electrodes at different current densities. It
is observed that both charging and discharging time durations decrease
with increasing current density from 0.5 to 20 A g–1. The calculated specific capacitances of both electrodes at each
current density are summarized in Figure 5e. The specific capacitances of the MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes are calculated
to be 1120 and 380 F g–1 at the current density
of 0.5 A g–1, and still maintain at 648 and 262
F g–1, respectively, when the current density increases
by as much as 40 times (20 A g–1), which indicate
that 57.9% of the initial specific capacitance of MoS2 nanoflower
electrode is retained, compared to 68.0% for MoS2 nanosheet
electrode. Both of them present an outstanding rate capability. Although
the specific capacitance of MoS2 nanoflower electrode declines
more dramatically than MoS2 nanosheet electrode with scan
rate, it possesses threefold specific capacitance as much as MoS2 nanosheet electrode at the highest current density of 20
A g–1. In fact, the MoS2 nanoflower electrode
presents the highest specific capacitance for pure MoS2 nanosheets, as shown in Figure 6(51,54) Even as the current density further
increases to 150 A g–1, it still retains a specific
capacitance of 300 F g–1, as shown in Figure S6, which is still higher than most of
carbonous supercapacitor.55−58 The cycling stability of the MoS2 nanoflower
and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes was examined by repeated
charge–discharge at 10 A g–1 for 2000 cycles.
In Figure 5f, the MoS2 nanoflower and MoS2 nanosheet electrodes retained
96% and 91% of their initial specific capacitance, respectively. It
means that the self-assembly can endow the electrodes a more excellent
cycling stability.

Figure 6 Comparison of capacities at different rates for our pure
MoS2 electrode materials and other pure electrode materials
reported
in different electrolytes.

To assess the practical application of MoS2 electrode,
a hybrid supercapacitor equipment was prepared using the MoS2 as positive electrode and AC as negative electrode in 3 M KOH aqueous
electrolyte (denoted as MoS2//AC), as schematically exhibited
in Figure S7a. The CV graph of the equipment
in Figure S7b exhibits close EDLC properties,
indicating a capacitor behavior. And the CV curves did not show obvious
distortion when the scan rate reaches up to 400 mV s–1, demonstrating a good rate character. When measured at different
current densities with a potential window of 1.7 V, the GCD curves
show analogous triangular shape, as shown in Figure S7c. In Figure S7d, there are curves
of specific capacitance calculated through GCD measurements. The device
presents an outstanding high value of 78.82 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1. At the same time, the corresponding
energy density and power density are 31.64 Wh kg–1 and 425 W kg–1. The cycle test of the device was performed through
GCD measurements at 2 A g–1 up to 10 000
cycles, and the result that includes capacitance and coulombic efficiency
is shown in Figure S7e. A small section
of GCD curve close to the end is shown in the inset. The specific
capacity and coulombic efficiency maintain a relatively stable stage
after initial hundreds of cycles. In particular, the GCD curves still
remain in their original shape after 10 000 cycles, and the
specific capacitance retention ratio of the device reaches up to 95.4%.

3 Conclusions
In this study, 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and nanoflowers self-assembled
by these nanosheets were fabricated via a one-pot facial hydrothermal
reaction. The self-assembly enhances the interconnection and stability
of these sheets. When both materials are used as electrochemical supercapacitor
electrode materials, the electron transferring in the nanoflowers
is easier than that in the nanosheets, as the conductive 1T-MoS2 nanosheets are connected with each other in the nanoflowers.
Thus, the MoS2 nanoflower electrode shows excellent electrochemical
properties in both KCl (where MoS2 acts as EDLCs) and KOH
(where MoS2 acts as batteries). In KCl, the specific capacitances
of the nanoflower electrode at 0.5 and 20 A g–1 are
483 and 305 F g–1, which are only 169 and 120 F
g–1 for the nanosheet electrode, respectively. The
electrode possesses excellent cyclic stability with the capacitance
retention ratio of 94% over 2000 cycles. The specific capacitance
of the nanoflower electrode further increased to 1120 F g–1 in KOH. The experiments in this paper indicate that assembling the
electrode material into a stable structure is of great help in improving
its electrochemical performance.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
Supercapacitor tests were
carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied
Research) in a three-electrode system at room temperature, containing
MoS2, SCE, and Pt electrodes as the working electrode,
reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively, and the
3 M KCl and KOH aqueous solution as the electrolytes. Electrodes were
first cycled for 20 cycles before measurement to stabilize the electrochemical
response. The slurry was the mixture that consists of the active material,
acetylene black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder in a weight
ratio of 80:15:5 with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone as
