The ligand, bis-β-diketone
with an azobenzene bridge (4,4′-(4,4,4-trifluoro-1,3-butanedione)azobenzene, H2L), was prepared for
the synthesis of a series of dinuclear lanthanide complexes with the
formula [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] (Ln = Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+,
and DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide). X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals
that the three complexes are triple-stranded dinuclear structures
formed by three bis-β-diketonate ligands with two lanthanide
ions (Ln3+). The trans-to-cis photoisomerization rates
of the azobenzene group of the three [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes in ethanol and acetonitrile
solutions are similar to those of the pure H2L ligand and other azobenzene-containing
mononuclear lanthanide complexes, but the trans-to-cis quantum yields
(Φt→c = 10–3) are 1 order
of magnitude smaller. The first-order rate constant for the cis-to-trans
thermal isomerization at 50 °C of the H2L ligand is similar to those of azobenzene
derivatives, while those for the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes (kiso = 10–4 s–1) are higher
than those of the mononuclear azobenzene-containing lanthanide complexes.
Furthermore, as the lanthanide ionic radius becomes smaller from Eu3+ to Gd3+ to Tb3+, the thermal isomerization
rate constant decreases and the half-life increases. All these results
are proposed to arise from the rigidity at both ends of the azo group
by coordination to the dinuclear lanthanide ions and the different
isomerization mechanisms. These are the first examples of bis-β-diketonate
dinuclear lanthanide complexes with an azobenzene bridge and help
illustrate the mechanism of azobenzene isomerization.

Introduction
It is well known that
the azobenzene molecule can undergo trans-to-cis
isomerization upon UV–visible light irradiation, which results
in changes to the absorption spectrum, molecular configuration, dipole
moment, geometric size, and surface free energy of the molecule, and
also reverse cis-to-trans isomerization by visible light or heating
(or in the dark).1−3 These special properties make it important for application
in the fields of optoelectronic information storage materials,4,5 molecular switches,6,7 liquid crystal materials,8,9 solar energy storage materials,10−12 and in biology.13−15 Extensive studies have shown that azobenzene and its derivatives
can exhibit an excellent reversible photoisomerization behavior. There
are many factors that affect the azobenzene photoisomerization properties,
which include the isomerization mechanism, rate, and pathway, such
as the intensity of light, irradiation wavelength, temperature, pressure,
solvent, and substituted groups on the azobenzene.16−26 Up to date, four mechanisms have been proposed to explain the possible
mechanism for azobenzene photoisomerization—rotation, inversion,
concerted inversion, and inversion-assisted rotation. These theories
can be referred to in some previously published reviews.1,3,12,20

With the intense research on the isomerization properties
of azobenzene,
the modification of azobenzene provides an important theoretical basis
to obtain more useful information on the photoresponsivity of azobenzene.7,10,12,18,26 Combining an azo moiety within coordination
compounds is an alternative to modify pure organic azobenzene and
can yield more versatile molecular properties such as redox, optical,
and magnetic properties, accompanying with the photoisomerization
reaction. Most of the studied azobenzene-modifed metal complexes were
ferrocene–azobenzene, bis or tris(bipyridine), terpyridine
metal complexes with azobenzene-conjugation, metalladithiolenes with
azobenzene groups, and azobenzene-containing tris-cyclometalated complexes.27−35 The center metal ions of these complexes were all the d-block group
VIII. They displayed reversible trans-to-cis photoisomerization. However,
the efficiency of the photoisomerization was lower than those of the
parent azobenzenes. To overcome this difficulty, we have focused on
the f-block lanthanide ions [Ln(III)], which have unusual electronic
properties caused by shielding of the 4f orbitals with the fully filled
5s25p6 subshells. Recently, we have studied
the photoinduced trans–cis–trans isomerization properties
of azobenzene-containing mononuclear and dinuclear lanthanide complexes
in the solution and solid states.36−38 Our study showed that
azobenzene-functionalized lanthanide complexes exhibit good reversible
trans–cis–trans isomerization properties both in solvents
and the solid state and can be recycled with good fatigue resistance.
Owing to the coordination of lanthanide ions, the functional properties
of the azobenzene group in the complexes are superior to those of
pure azobenzene ligands. In addition to the good photoinduced trans–cis–trans
isomerization properties, the complexes of Eu and Yb can also exhibit
luminescence with the dual characteristics of photoinduced trans–cis–trans
isomerism and luminescence, which can realize multiple practical applications.
Therefore, these azobenzene functionalized lanthanide complexes deserve
further exploration and development. Recently, studies on the photophysical
properties of bis-β-diketonate lanthanide complexes with triple-stranded
dinuclear helicate structures have received extensive interest.39−42 These triple-stranded dinuclear helicate bis-β-diketonate
lanthanide complexes have the characteristic of rigidity, yet differ
from macrocyclic azobenzene dimers whose effect of rigidity has been
discussed and whose photochemical and thermal isomerizations have
been reported.43−45 In this context, a new bis-β-diketone with
an azobenzene bridged ligand, 4,4′-(4,4,4-trifluoro-1,3-butanedione)azobenzene
(H2L), was prepared
to synthesize three dinuclear lanthanide (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb) complexes
(Scheme 1). The photo
and thermal isomerizations of the H2L ligand and its triple-stranded helicate dinuclear
lanthanide complexes were investigated, and their properties were
compared with those of nonrigid azobenzene-attached lanthanide complexes.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedures for Preparation of the Ligands and Complexes
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of the Complexes
Scheme 1 shows the synthetic
method of the complexes [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] (Ln = Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+). The typical carbonyl stretching frequency of H2L (1600 cm–1) in the infrared (IR) spectra was red-shifted in the complexes,
with values of 1614 cm–1 in [Eu2L3(DMSO)4]; 1615 cm–1 in [Gd2L3(DMSO)4]; and 1615 cm–1 in [Tb2L3(DMSO)4], which suggests
the carbonyl oxygen was coordinated to the central Ln3+ ion. It is clear that no significant change was observed in the
absorption peak position of the azo group (−N=N−)
and trifluoromethyl group (−CF3), both in the free
ligand and the complexes. At the same time, owing to the coordination
of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the characteristic absorption peaks
of the S=O double bond appeared at around 1308 and 1288 cm–1.

It is shown from the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) data that complex [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] underwent a mass loss of 7.29% (calcd 7.87%)
in the first step (155–247 °C), which corresponded to
the loss of the two coordinated DMSO molecules, and then, it underwent
a second step decomposition (247–312 °C) with a mass loss
of 15.29% (calcd 15.74%), which corresponded to the loss of all four
coordinated DMSO molecules (Figure S1).
For the complexes [Gd2L3(DMSO)4] and [Tb2L3(DMSO)4], the two weight loss curves were almost overlapping.
Complexes [Gd2L3(DMSO)4] and [Tb2L3(DMSO)4] were more stable than complex [Eu2L3(DMSO)4], and their first
mass loss occurred between 207 and 268 °C, and the mass loss
rate was 7.76 and 7.71%, respectively (calcd loss for two DMSO molecules
was 7.83 and 7.81%, respectively); the second mass loss occurred at
268–312 °C, and the mass loss rate was 13.67 and 13.64%,
which is also consistent with the calculated loss of four DMSO molecules
(14.45%). All three complexes continued to lose mass and gradually
decomposed as the temperature was increased after the complexes experienced
the two mass loss steps. TGA showed that the three bis-β-diketonate
lanthanide complexes exhibited high stability.

The powder XRD
pattern (Figure S2) of
the three complexes were recorded over the 2θ = 10°–80°
range. They all exhibited a crystalline nature with sharp peaks. The
powder X-ray diffraction pattern matched well with the simulated pattern
and confirmed the phase purity of the complexes.

X-ray Crystallographic
Analysis
The crystallographic
data of the three complexes [Eu2L3(DMSO)4], [Gd2L3(DMSO)4], and [Tb2L3(DMSO)4] are listed in Table S1 in
the Supporting Information. Selected bond
lengths and angles are shown in Tables S2–S4. The single crystal structure data show that all the three complexes
crystallized in the triclinic P1̅ space group
with two molecules in the unit cell. The two central Ln(III) ions
had the same coordination mode. Each lanthanide ion was coordinated
with eight oxygen atoms to form a stable double-capped triangular
prism structure, of which six oxygen atoms came from the three deprotonated H2L ligands and the other
two came from two DMSOs (Figures 1 and S3–S4). The
structure featured a triple-stranded dinuclear helicate with two crystallographically
equivalent lanthanide(III) ions coordinated to three bis-β-diketonate
ligands. The bond lengths of the Eu–O, Gd–O, and Tb–O
bonds coordinated to the bis-β-diketonate in the complexes were
2.357–2.438, 2.347–2.425, and 2.327–2.416 Å,
respectively, which are in accordance with the reported values in
their diketonate complexes.46,47 The bond lengths of
the Eu–O, Gd–O, and Tb–O bonds coordinated to
the solvent DMSO molecules ranged from 2.367 to 2.403, 2.352 to 2.391,
and 2.350 to 2.383 Å, respectively, which are also in the ranges
of the reported values.36,37 The bond lengths of
the N=N bond in the three molecule were 1.240, 1.247, and 1.249
Å, respectively, which are in the normal ranges compared with
the bond lengths in azobenzene-attached lanthanide derivatives. It
is evident that the bond length of Ln–O slightly decreased
and the bond length of N=N increased with an increase of atomic
number from Eu to Gd to Tb. In the three complexes, all the C–N=N–C
dihedral angles were close to 180° and N=N–C angles
were in the range 111.7°–115.9°, in good agreement
with the values found in azobenzene derivatives.48

Photoisomerization Behavior of Ligand H2L and Complexes [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] in Solutions
Figure 2 shows the UV–visible
absorption spectral changes of the bis-β-diketone ligand H2L under 365 nm (UV)
and 450 nm (visible) light irradiation with time in an ethanol solution.
As shown in Figure 2a, the intensity of the π–π* transition absorption
peak at 372 nm (ε372nm = 4.25 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1) gradually decreased
as a function of time under UV light irradiation, and the π–π*
transition absorption peak at 257 nm (ε257nm = 7.41
× 103 L mol–1 cm–1) increased, with an isosbestic point at 325 nm. The maximum wavelength
of the absorption peak at 372 nm was gradually blue-shifted to 362
nm, which arose from the poor planarity of the cis configuration.
The n−π* characteristic transition absorption peak of
azobenzene in the range 400–500 nm was not observed. This may
result from the close energy between the π–π* and
n−π* transitions in ethanol solution and the two transition
peaks overlapped, as is observed for aminoazobenzenes.1,37 This spectral change indicated that the bis-β-diketone ligand H2L gradually changed
from the trans configuration to the cis configuration. When the solution
was irradiated for 10 min, a photostable state was reached. Subsequently,
when the solution was irradiated with visible light, the absorption
band at 362 nm was gradually red-shifted and its intensity sharply
increased in the first 8 s and remained unchanged after 12 s, which
led to a 48% recovery of the absorption spectrum. The spectral changes
of H2L in acetonitrile
solution under UV light irradiation and its recoverable spectrum after
irradiation with visible light were also examined. They were shown
to be similar to those observed in ethanol solution (Figures S5–S6). The reversible isomerization reaction
could be maintained for more than 10 cycles, which indicated good
fatigue resistance and reversibility of the photoisomerization reaction.
The first-order kinetics rate constants of the photoisomerization
reaction of H2L in
the ethanol and acetonitrile solutions were calculated to be 8.8 ×
10–3 and 7.0 × 10–3 s–1, and the quantum yields were determined to be 0.041
and 0.023 (Table 1),
respectively, which are slightly larger than those of azobenzene and
its derivatives. The photoisomerization data showed a slightly higher
isomerization efficiency in the higher polarity ethanol solvent.

The photoisomerization reactions of the three [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes showed
a similarity in the ethanol and acetonitrile solutions. The absorption
spectra of the three complexes were almost identical, as shown by
the UV–vis data in Table 2. The molar absorption coefficients at the maximum
wavelengths were more than three times that of the free ligand, owing
to the three ligands in the complexes. Taking the [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex as an
example, Figure 3 shows
the characteristic spectral changes of the [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex in ethanol solution
under UV and visible light irradiation (the other spectral change
data are provided in Figures S7–S9). The typical π–π* absorption band of the [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex
in ethanol solution exhibited a peak at 366 nm with a shoulder peak
at 300 nm. Upon irradiation of the solution with UV light, the spectral
changes were similar to those of the pure H2L ligand but with no maximum wavelength
shift. The [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex reached a photostable state after 20 min with
irradiation at 365 nm, and 70% of the complex returned to the trans
form after the UV irradiation was switched to visible light for 4
s. The recovery percentage of the trans form was higher than that
of the pure H2L ligand.
This spectral change indicated that the azo group in the [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex was
in a more rigid environment and its trans form was more stable than
that of the pure H2L ligand. Ten cycles of trans–cis–trans photoisomerization
were performed by irradiating the [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex in ethanol solution with
UV light for 30 min followed by visible light for 3 min. It was found
that there were no signs of photodegradation. This indicated that
the complex is stable under these conditions.

The first-order kinetics rate constants of the photoisomerization
reactions of the three [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes in ethanol and acetonitrile solutions
are shown in Table 1, which were similar to those of the pure H2L ligand and
our previously reported azobenzene-containing lanthanide complexes.
This demonstrated that the photoisomerization reaction activation
energies are similar in the azobenzene-containing lanthanide complexes.
However, in these three complexes, the trans-to-cis quantum yields
were 1 order of magnitude smaller than both the pure H2L ligand and other azobenzene-containing
lanthanide complexes. This may be because of the rigidity at both
ends of the azo group by coordination to the dinuclear lanthanide
ions and the different photoisomerization pathways.

In addition,
the photoisomerization properties of the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes doped
in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films were also investigated. The
trans-to-cis isomerization in the PMMA film was not observed. Different
from our previously studied lanthanide complexes doped in PMMA, the
trans-to-cis photoisomerization was hampered in a rigid environment
owing to the azo group being in a rigid environment of the complex
in solid state.

Thermal cis-to-trans Isomerization of the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] Complexes
Cis-to-trans isomerization of azobenzene and its derivatives can
also spontaneously occur in the dark. In the ethanol and acetonitrile
solutions, after solutions of the ligand H2L or the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes were irradiated by UV
light for half an hour to reach the photostable state, the solutions
were then placed in the dark and the UV–visible absorption
spectrum was obtained as a function of time. It was observed that
a spontaneous change from the cis form to the relatively more stable
trans form was achieved in the dark. This showed that the ligand H2L in ethanol or acetonitrile
solutions could be returned to its original trans-form after being
placed in the dark for about 2 days. The complexes could also gradually
change from cis to trans, albeit a little slower than the free ligand
(about 4 days) because the degree of freedom of the ligand in the
complex was relatively small and the azobenzene moiety in the complex
was more rigid and restricted, owing to the dinuclear triple helix
structure of the complex.

Thermal cis-to-trans isomerization
of both the ligand H2L and the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes in ethanol or acetonitrile solutions was also
investigated as a function of temperature (Figure S10). The results showed that the complexes were stable in
solution and the ligands did not dissociate in the solvents as temperature
increased. The rate constants of the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes were a little different
from those of the pure ligands, whereas the order of magnitude of
thermal isomerization rates was the same as those of the pure ligands.
This indicated that the thermal isomerization pathway in the ligand
and these complexes was simple, and also similar to that of the free
azobenzene ligands and our previously reported azobenzene-attached
lanthanide complexes.36,37 It should be pointed out that
the conversion of cis-to-trans under heating was higher than that
by light irradiation at room temperature.

Owing to the rates
of cis-to-trans thermal isomerization of H2L and the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes at
room temperature being very slow, the thermal cis-to-trans isomerization
of H2L and the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes
was investigated at 50 °C. The UV–visible spectral changes
of thermal cis-to-trans isomerization of the [Eu2L3(DMSO)4] complex in ethanol
solution are shown in Figure 4 and the others are shown in Figures S11 and S12 in the Supporting Information. The first-order rate
constants for the cis-to-trans thermal isomerization at 50 °C
of H2L were similar
to those of the azobenzene derivatives, while the first-order rate
constants for the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes were higher than those of the previously
reported azobenzene-containing lanthanide complexes.38 This can be attributed to the restricted rigid structure
of azobenzene in the complex. The first-order rate constants (k) and half-lives (τ1/2) at 50 °C
are shown in Table 3. The thermal isomerization rate of H2L in ethanol solution was higher than that in
acetonitrile solution as a result of the solvent effect, but the thermal
isomerization rate and half-life of the complexes in ethanol and acetonitrile
solutions were basically the same regardless of the solvent effect.
This clearly proves that cis-to-trans thermal isomerization of H2L proceeds via a rotation
mechanism while that of the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes proceeds via an inversion
mechanism. These mechanism can be discriminated from the dependence
of k on the solvent polarity.49,50 The rotation mechanism occurs through a transition state (TS) where
one nitrogen atom is sp hybridized, whereas rotation proceeds by dipolar
TS. In the rotation mechanism, the dipolar TS is stabilized in polar
solvents and higher values for k should be obtained;
for the inversion mechanism, very small variation of k with solvent should be observed. It can be also seen from the Table 3 that as the atomic
number increased from Eu to Gd to Tb, the lanthanide ionic radius
became smaller, the thermal isomerization rate constant decreased
and the half-life increased, which is in agreement with the order
of the complex stability.

Luminescent Properties of the Complexes
It is a pity
that no luminescence of the solution and solid state was observed
for the three complexes at room temperature. This arose from the extremely
weak fluorescence of the ligand itself and the inability to transfer
its energy to the lanthanide ions.35 The
singlet state energy levels of the ligand is estimated by referencing
its absorbance edge, and they are equal of energy with 2.36 eV both
in ethanol and acetonitrile solutions. From the phosphorescence spectrum
of the [Gd2L3(DMSO)4] complex (Figure S13), the triplet
energy level of ligand corresponding to its emission wavelength is
calculated to be 1.98 eV. We also confirmed this experimental result
by theoretically calculating the excited state energy levels of the
ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful and effective
tool for solving many complicated problems in molecular electronic
structures, and has successfully predicted the ground state and time-dependent
excited state properties.51−53 The most commonly used DFT is
the hybrid functional (Becke’s three-parameter correlation
functional) and the Lee, Yang, and Parr exchange functional B3LYP
method. We used the Gaussian 09a software to theoretically calculate
the H2L structure
at the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set with the B3LYP mixing functional using
the DFT and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method.
The molecular geometry was optimized by frequency calculations until
it no longer showed any imaginary frequency to ensure the optimized
geometry was in the lowest energy and most stable state, and then
the molecule excitation energies were calculated in the gas by TD-DFT.
The polarization continuum model was also used to calculate the lowest
singlet and triplet excitation energies of the ligand molecule in
ethanol and acetonitrile solvents, as shown in Table 4.

The TD-DFT calculated energy of
the first singlet excited state
(2.32 eV) of the ligand in the solvent is very close to the experiment
data, while the triplet excited state energy (1.66 eV) is a little
smaller than the experimental data (1.98 eV). The deviation of the
triplet excited state energy with 0.32 eV by TD-DFT calculation compared
to the experimental result because the observed experimental phosphorescence
emission energy as reference data may not exactly match the vertical
excitation energy, and it is accepted that TD-DFT calculation underestimates
the excitation energy in some case.54 However,
both the experimental and the theoretical calculation results showed
that the excitation energies of the ligand H2L in the lowest excited triplet state
were all less than the first excited state of Eu3+, the
energy level of the 5D0 was 2.1434 eV, and the 5D4 of Tb3+ 2.5416 eV and the 6P7/2 of
Gd3+ was 3.9957 eV. According to the theory of Sato and
Wada,55 the synthesized bis-β-diketone
azobenzene ligand H2L is unable to efficiently transfer its energy to lanthanide ions.
At the same time, the calculation results also showed that the oscillatory
intensity of the first excited singlet state of azobenzene was zero,
and the oscillator strength of the second excited singlet state was
close to 1, which indicated that the ligand was mainly excited to
the second excited singlet state; generally, relaxing to the first
excited singlet state and then to the ground state also hampers the
transfer of energy from the ligand to the lanthanide ions. The calculation
results prove the reason why the luminescence of the three lanthanide
complexes was not observed at room temperature. Therefore, it is necessary
to determine the excitation energies of a ligand by theoretical calculation
to assist in designing a reasonable ligand to obtain luminescent lanthanide
complexes.

Conclusions
We synthesized three
bis-β-diketonate lanthanide complexes
with an azobenzene bridge and characterized their structures. The
three complexes crystallize in the triclinic P1̅
space groups and the structure features a triple-stranded dinuclear
helicate by the coordination of three bis-β-diketonate ligands
to two crystallographically equivalent eight-coordinated lanthanide(III)
ions. All three complexes show the photoisomerization reactions in
solutions similar to their pure H2L ligand. The trans-to-cis quantum yields are 1 order
of magnitude smaller than both the pure H2L ligand and the other azobenzene-containing lanthanide
complexes. The photoisomerization reaction activation energy is similar
in the azobenzene-containing lanthanide complexes. The rates of thermal
isomerization of the [Ln2L3(DMSO)4] complexes at 50 °C are almost the same
as those of the pure ligands and higher than our previously reported
azobenzene-attached lanthanide complexes, and the conversion of cis-to-trans
under heating is higher than that by light irradiation at room temperature.
Furthermore, as the atomic number increases, the lanthanide ionic
radius from Eu3+ to Gd3+ to Tb3+ becomes
smaller, the thermal isomerization rate constant decreases and the
half-life increases, which is in agreement with the order of the complex
stability. All these characteristics can be supposed to arise from
the rigidity at both ends of the azo group by coordination to the
dinuclear lanthanide ions and the different photoisomerization pathway.
These are the first examples of bis-β-diketonate lanthanide
complexes with an azobenzene bridge and will assist to illustrate
the azobenzene isomerization mechanism for theoretical chemists.

Methods
Materials
and Methods
Ln(NO3)3·6H2O (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb; Beijing Huawei Ruike Chemical
Co., Ltd.), 4-aminoacetophenone, PMMA (Alfa Aesar), and ethyl trifluoroacetate
(Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd.) were used as received. All other chemicals
were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sinopharm Chemicals
Group Co. Analytical-grade solvents were redistilled prior to use.
The melting points were determined with X-4 micromelting point apparatus
(Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd) without
correction. The elemental analyses were acquired with a Vario EL III
elemental analyzer. The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
data were obtained with a Bruker ESQUIRE-3000 Plus LC–MS/MS
spectrometer. The IR spectra (KBr pellets) were scanned with a Nicolet
Avatar FT-IR 330 spectrometer. The solution 1H NMR spectra
were obtained at 400 MHz with a Bruker ADVANCE 400 spectrometer at
25 °C. The chemical shifts (ppm) were determined using tetramethylsilane
as the internal reference. TGA was carried out on a SDTQ 600 thermogravimeter
under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The UV–visible (vis) absorption spectra were scanned on a Shimadzu
UV224012PC absorption spectrometer. A Shanghai Yihui ZF-3 UV analyzer
was used to produce the 365 nm UV light and the 450 nm visible light
was produced from a 300 W PLS-SXE300CUV Xe lamp and isolated by a
sharp cut-off filter.

p-Aminoacetophenone
(0.068 g, 0.5 mmol) and sodium
iodide (0.15 g, 1.0 mmol) were mixed in a 100 mL flask, then t-butyl hypochlorite (0.11 g, 1.0 mmol) was slowly added
under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the reaction was kept at a temperature
of −20 °C for 12 h. After the reaction was completed,
sodium thiosulfate solution (10.0 mL, 1.0 mmol/L) was added to the
reaction mixture solution, and the mixture was stirred for 2 min.
The reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane three times.
The lower layer solution was collected and dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and washed several
times with acetone, and the solid was collected to give a pure dark
red solid L1 (0.074 g, yield 57%). m.p. 209–210

Ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (5 mL) was added to a 100
mL flask containing 0.08 g (2 mmol) sodium hydride. The solution was
stirred at room temperature for 10 min; then 0.284 g (2 mmol) of ethyl
trifluoroacetate was added to the above solution, and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature for another 30 min. After that, 0.18
g (0.68 mmol) of L1 was added to the above mixed solution and stirred
for 24 h. When the reaction was completed, 10 mL of ice water was
added to the mixtures. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 2–3
with 0.1 mol/L HCl, then the solution was filtered, and the precipitate
was washed with 1:1 ethanol/water (V/V). The product was recrystallized
from petroleum ether and chloroform mixed solvents to give a pure
brown solid H2L (0.54

Synthesis
of Ln(III) Complexes
General Procedures
Ligand H2L (0.137 g, 0.3 mmol)
was added to a round-bottom
flask containing 10 mL of absolute ethanol and stirred at 60 °C,
and then 0.6 mL of 1.0 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution was added dropwise
to the solution. After the ligand L was completely dissolved, the
solution was stirred continuously at room temperature. When the solution
was cooled to room temperature, a solution of rare earth nitrate salt
(0.2 mmol) in 2 mL of absolute ethanol was added slowly to the above
reaction system, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature
for 24 h. After the reaction was completed, 15 mL of deionized water
was added to the solution and filtered. The precipitate was washed
with 1:1 ethanol/water mixed solvents several times and dried in a
vacuum drying oven. The solid powder was crystalized with mixed solvents
of DMSO and absolute ethanol to obtain a final pure rare earth complex.
Suitable crystals were obtained by volatilization of the solution
in a test tube having a diameter of 0.5 cm.

Structure
Determination of[Ln2L3(DMSO)4]Complexes
by X-ray Diffraction
The single-crystal data of [Eu2L3(DMSO)4], [Gd2L3(DMSO)4],
and [Tb2L3(DMSO)4] were collected using an Oxford Diffraction Gemini R Ultra Ruby CCD
diffractometer with MoKα (α = 0.71073 Å) radiation.
Absorption correction was applied to the data using the multiscan
CrysAlis Red program.58 The structures
were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares
calculations based on F2 using the SHELXTL-2014
software package.59 All of the non-hydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically. Data for the crystal structures
of the three complexes have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre (CCDC 1546472, 1546473, 1546474 for complexes [Eu2L3(DMSO)4], [Gd2L3(DMSO)4] and [Tb2L3(DMSO)4], respectively);
