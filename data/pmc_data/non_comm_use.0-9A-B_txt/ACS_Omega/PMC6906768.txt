The present study reports on CuO-assisted reduction of Cr(VI) under
ambient conditions using sodium borohydride and its complete removal.
The confirmation of the reductive removal of Cr(VI) was assisted by
powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron
microscopy, mic absorption spectro, UV–vis, and UV–vis–diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy techniques. The analysis revealed that the
process involved adsorption of dichromate ion on the surface of copper
oxide, reduction of Cr(VI), and precipitation of Cr(III) as its hydroxide.
Cr(VI) reduction capacity of CuO was found to be around 27.2 mmol/(g
h). The residue collected showed promising reusability for 3 to 4
cycles, and the exhausted residue was finally converted into a black
composite, CuO/CuCr2O4. The composite showed
positive response for the photodegradation of methyl orange. Thus,
the current protocol proposed a complete package of cost-effective
reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), precipitation into its hydroxide,
and the conversion of the residue into a photoactive composite.

1 Introduction
Hexavalent chromium is identified as one of the most abundant contaminants
in water bodies1 due to the emanation of
wastewaters from industries involving the processes such as electroplating,
leather tanning, pigment processing, and wood preservation.2−4 Discharging the effluents containing chromium without pretreatment
or improper treatment leads to contamination of water sources and
pollutes the environment, which will eventually affect the health
of living beings.5 The permissible level
of residual Cr(VI) in water is reported to be 0.05 ppm.6 Cr(VI) contamination in the environment may cause
health problems including allergic reactions, skin rashes, nose irritations
and nosebleed, ulcers, weakened immune system, genetic material alteration,
and kidney and liver damage.6,7 Hence, from environment
safety and health points of view, it is essential to develop an effective
Cr(VI) treatment and removal method.

The rich literature available on various methods such as chemical
precipitation; reverse osmosis; ion exchange; foam flotation; electrolysis;
adsorption; and chemical, biological, and photochemical reduction8 for the treatment and removal of Cr(VI) demonstrates
the significance of the environmental problems due to its contamination.
As Cr(III) is much less toxic, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is considered
to be a better option to take care of the Cr(VI) hazardousness.6,9 Reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is reported to be achieved chemically,
biologically, and photochemically.10−15 Biotreatments are considered to be cost-effective and environmentally
friendly; however, such methods are generally slow. Considering the
chemical route, which is generally a viable method, most of the recent
protocols involve costly chemicals such as Pd- and Pt-containing systems,
complex catalyst preparation steps, and long duration.6,15,16 Such processes focus mainly on
the reduction of Cr(VI) and in general have not addressed the secondary
waste accumulation. The current study focused on the usage of a cost-effective
material for the reduction of Cr(VI) and in addition addressed the
transformation of accumulating secondary waste. The process involves
reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the presence of copper oxide and
the conversion of the collected residue into a photoactive product
CuO/CuCr2O4, which shows photcatalytic activity
for degradation of organic dyes.

2 Results and Discussion
Chemical reduction of Cr(VI) using sodium borohydride in the presence
of CuO as a catalyst is studied. The experiment is performed using
both commercially available and freshly prepared CuO samples. The
oxide is prepared by the combustion method. The powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern given in Figure S1 shows
pure CuO formation as per the standard data (JCPDS # 89-5895). The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows formation of grains
of different geometries and are of multiple sizes. The chemical conversion
of Cr(VI) has been carried out at room temperature. Optimized experimental
conditions are obtained by varying the parameters as given in the Experimental Section.

2.1 Reduction of Cr(VI)
Initially, 100
ppm Cr(VI) solution is treated with 12.5 mL of 0.5 M sodium borohydride
solution in the presence of 0.1 g of CuO. The pH of the Cr(VI) solution
is not adjusted and is noted to be 4.8 at room temperature (35 °C).
The solution is sampled at regular intervals and analyzed by UV–vis
spectroscopy. Disappearance of the characteristic absorbance peak
at 352 nm, which corresponds to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer
transition6 in the spectrum of potassium
dichromate is considered to be the index of conversion of Cr(VI).
Profiles shown in Figure S2i confirm the
complete conversion of Cr(VI) in a span of 15 min (the experiment
was carried out till 120 min). In the case of the solutions whose
pH is adjusted to 2 and 10, the process of complete reduction of Cr(VI)
requires a duration of 30 min (Figure S2ii,iii). The observations suggest that the current protocol could be applied
to liquid environments having a wide range of pH values. As there
is no significant effect of pH on the reduction process, all of the
successive experiments have been carried out without adjusting the
pH. It is to be noted here that in most of the reductive removal protocols
reported, reduction is carried out under highly acidic conditions.17−19 Control experiments carried out in the presence of sodium borohydride
and CuO separately indicate no significant conversion of Cr(VI) (Figure S3), thus providing evidence for the catalytic
activity of CuO. Decrease in the amount of the catalyst to 50 and
25 mg resulted in complete conversion in 30 and 240 min, respectively.
When the amount of the catalyst is reduced further to 2 mg, incomplete
conversion is noticed even after longer reaction duration. The effect
of concentration of dichromate solution also shows difference in reaction
duration: in the presence of 100 mg of CuO, complete conversion of
20 ppm of potassium dichromate takes place within a minute of mixing,
100 ppm requires 15 min, and increasing the concentration to 500 ppm
increases the duration to 135 min. The conversion experiment carried
out using lower concentrations of sodium borohydride, viz., 0.25,
0.125, and 0.0635 M (CuO, 100 mg; dichromate solution, 100 ppm) shows
that the first two concentrations resulted in complete conversion
during 15 min of reaction, while in the presence of 0.0635 M sodium
borohydride, the duration has gone up to 30 min. Thus, the optimal
experimental conditions for the conversion of 100 ppm dichromate solution
in 15 min are found to be CuO, 100 mg; NaBH4, 0.125 M;
and pH, 4.8. As Cr(VI) is found to be stable over a wide range of
pH values,8 current study’s observation
of the reduction of Cr(VI) at different pH conditions in the range
2–10 provides an advantage in the treatment of Cr(VI) in aqueous
media of different pH values. The activity of commercial CuO is found
to be similar to that of freshly prepared CuO, which practically gives
an additional advantage.

The diphenylamine test confirms the
complete reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (Figure 1). The initial dichromate solution before
the reduction procedure gives a bluish violet or purple color with
diphenylamine (Figure 1a), which is due to the oxidation of diphenylamine by dichromate.20 However, the solution obtained after the reduction
process does not show any color change (Figure 1b) with diphenylamine, indicating the absence
of Cr(VI). Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis of the liquid
sample after the completion of the process shows the presence of only
trace amount of Cr (∼0.5 ppm). This could be due to complete
reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which is less mobile in nature21 and precipitates as hydroxide.

before the reduction reaction and (b) after the reaction.

The experiment is performed under similar conditions using simulated
tannery wastewater containing Fe3+, Al3+, Na+, Cl–, and SO42– ions22 to study the effect of the presence
of other ions on the reduction process. The results given in Figure 2 confirm the absence
of the interference. A complete reduction of Cr(VI) is noticed within
a span of 15 min.

tannery water sample.

2.2 Kinetics and Analysis of the Resultant Residue
The kinetics of the process of reduction of Cr(VI) is monitored
by the change in intensity of the absorption peak at 352 nm as a function
of time. The plot shown in Figure 3 displays a linear correlation between ln(Ao/At) and time. The experimental
conditions are as follows: potassium dichromate solution, 500 ppm;
CuO, 100 mg; NaBH4, 0.125 M; and pH, 4.8. A pseudo-first-order
model is applied to demonstrate the kinetics of the reduction of Cr(VI)
in the presence of CuO. The rate constant is determined to be 7.7
× 10–3 min–1.

Figure 3 Plot of ln(Ao/At) vs time for the reduction of Cr(VI).

The pH of the solution is measured as 10.2 after the addition of
sodium borohydride to the mixture of CuO and dichromate solution (15
min stirring). The increase in the pH during the process helps in
the precipitation of Cr(III) as its hydroxide. It is noted that Cr(OH)3 predominates in the pH range 6–12.23 The residue collected after the reaction is analyzed by
the powder X-ray diffraction technique, and the pattern is compared
with that of pure copper oxide (Figure 4). Close examination specifies the presence of metallic
Cu and Cr(OH)3·3H2O along with a small
amount of CuO in the residue. The peaks appearing at 2θ = (43.28,
50.44°) and 2θ = 36.48° in Figure 4ii confirm the presence of metallic Cu and
Cr(OH)3·3H2O, respectively. The reduction
of Cr(VI) is also confirmed by the presence of hydroxide of Cr(III)
as revealed in the powder XRD pattern in Figure 4ii. Such a possibility of formation of Cr(III)
hydroxide and its precipitation on the surface of the adsorbent is
reported.21

Figure 4 Powder XRD patterns of (i) pure CuO and (ii) CuO after the reaction
((a) Cu, (b) Cr(OH)3·3H2O, (c) CuO).

It is to be noted that the current protocol does not require addition
of sodium hydroxide separately as reported in most of the reduction
and precipitation procedures wherein for the precipitation of Cr(III),
sodium hydroxide is added.17−19 The increase in the pH of the
dichromate solution from 4.8 to 10.2 after the process could be due
to the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride in the presence of copper
oxide, which results in the generation of hydrogen needed for the
reduction reaction as given below.24  Under this condition, Cr(III), which is formed
by the reduction of Cr(VI), subsequently gets precipitated out as
its hydroxide. The processes of adsorption of the dichromate ion on
the surface of CuO and its reduction and precipitation as hydroxide
are monitored by infrared spectral analysis on the samples collected
as given below.1. CuO immersed in dichromate solution,
stirred for 15 min, residue collected after drying as such (C1)

2. CuO immersed in dichromate solution,
stirred for 15 min, residue washed and dried (C2)

3. CuO immersed in dichromate solution,
sodium borohydride added, stirred for 15 min, residue collected after
drying as such (C3)

4. CuO immersed in dichromate solution,
sodium borohydride added, stirred for 15 min, residue washed and dried
(C4)



The IR spectra of C1–C4 are given in Figure 5. CuO peaks appear in the 440–590
cm–1 region.25 The spectra
of both C1 and C2 show similar features before and after washing the
residue. This specifies the attachment of dichromate ions to the catalyst
surface (spectrum of dichromate is given in Figure 5ii for comparison). In the spectrum of C3
(Figure 5iii), along
with other species, the presence of Cr(OH)3·xH2O is identified based on the bands appearing
at around 3335, 1640, 939, and 520 cm–1.26 Such features completely disappear in the spectrum
of C4 (Figure 5iii),
which represents the residue collected after washing. This observation
confirms the absence of interaction of Cr(III) hydroxide with the
catalyst surface; thus, in the initial step, adsorption of the dichromate
ion on the surface of the metal oxide takes place, which further gets
reduced to Cr(III) upon introduction of sodium borohydride, and finally
the ion is precipitated out as its hydroxide.

and C3, C4 (iii).

2.3 Reaction Pathway and Reusability of the Catalyst
Cr(VI) exists in different forms in aqueous solution depending
on the pH of the medium. Dichromate (Cr2O72–) and hydrogen chromate (HCrO4–) ions exist in equilibrium in the pH range 2.0–6.0. The predominant
form at higher pH is (CrO42–).27 As it can be seen from the reactions given below,
the reduction of these different species essentially requires protons
and electrons12,28 1   2   3  In the current protocol, the required species
such as electrons and protons for the reduction of Cr(VI) are chemically
generated during CuO-assisted hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The
control experiments (Section 2.3), reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and its precipitation
as its hydroxide as evidenced from the diphenylamine test, AAS, and
powder XRD analyses, provide the information that the copper oxide
acts as a catalyst in the process of hydrolysis of sodium borohydride
and thus assisted in the generation of the required active species.
Copper oxide aids in discharging electrons from BH4–, and the H+ ions are offered by water,
which is the medium in the hydrolysis reaction.29 The presence of metallic copper in the residue (Figure 4) collected after
the conversion shows simultaneous reduction of both Cr(VI) and Cu(II).
This suggests a probable pathway of reduction of CuO to Cu via Cu2O in the presence of sacrificial NaBH4. This in
turn aids the conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Reaction pathway.

Interestingly, the collected residue also shows activity. The residue
collected by centrifugation is dried and tested. Reduction in the
amount of the residue is noticed in each cycle: the amounts after
first, second, and third cycles are 67, 57, and 51 mg, respectively.
The UV–vis absorbance profiles compiled in Figure S4 show the activities of the residues upon treating
with 100 ppm dichromate solution. First two cycles show the completion
of the conversion in 15 min, and the third cycle indicates 30 min
of duration due to relatively lesser amount of the residue (51 mg).
Since the collected residue is a mixture of Cu, Cr(OH)3·3H2O, and CuO, the species that are responsible
for the activity in the recycling process could be metallic copper
and copper oxide. The activity of metallic copper is tested separately
under similar experimental conditions. The results (Figure S4iv) confirm that the freshly formed copper during
the reduction process further acts as the catalyst and thus the resultant
residue can be reused till it gets exhausted and leads to affordable
reduction of Cr(VI).

2.4 Conversion of the Residue into a Photoactive
Composite and the Advantage of the Current Protocol
The residues
collected in the treatment of 500 ppm (CR500) and 100 ppm (CR100)
dichromate solutions were dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and the
nitrate mixtures were combusted separately using urea as a fuel. The
black mass obtained was subjected to powder X-ray diffraction analysis.
The results confirmed the formation of a composite of CuO and CuCr2O4 (Figure 7i). The residues collected from the reactions of both CR100
and CR500 show similar product formation. The plots of % reflectance
vs wavelength data (Figure 7ii) given in the range 200–800 nm show almost 90% absorbance
of the incident radiation. Table 1 shows the low color coordinates L*a*b* of CR100 and CR500 samples,
which characterize black hue (Figure 7ii inset).30 Different morphologies
of the products are inferred from the SEM images (Figure 7ii inset) of the composites. Figure 7iii shows the absorbance
vs wavelength spectra of the composites obtained using CR100 and CR500.
Comparison of the spectra with that of pure CuO proves the formation
of the composite. It is evident that the formation of composite with
CuCr2O4 influences the absorption edge of CuO.
The absorption edge of the composites is red-shifted compared to that
of CuO. Similar observation is made by Mageshwari et al. in the case
of a CuCr2O4-embedded CuO nanocomposite.31 The photoactivity of the composite is tested
for the degradation of methyl orange (MO). During irradiation, the
MO solution turns colorless, and the UV–vis spectra recorded
initially, after 90 and 120 min, are given in Figure 8. The disappearance of the characteristic
azo band of methyl orange appearing at around 465 nm confirms the
degradation of the dye at around 120 min. The advantages of the current
protocol include usage of a simple cost-effective oxide, reusability
of the resultant residue as a catalyst, and conversion of the exhausted
residue into a photoactive composite. Thus, the current protocol demonstrates
a route toward possible alleviation of secondary pollution.

A survey of reports on reductive removal of Cr(VI) proposes various
approaches. The protocol involving extraction, reduction, and precipitation
requires emulsion liquid membrane for extraction, ferrous salt for
reduction, and alkali for precipitation and heating at 100 °C
for an efficient process.17 Mu et al. have
reported the removal of Cr(VI) via reduction and adsorption using
core–shell Fe@Fe2O3.32 The experiment was performed under an Ar atmosphere involving
100 mL of 8 ppm Cr(VI) solution and 0.015 g of core–shell Fe@Fe2O3 at room temperature. Ali et al. studied the
removal of Cr(VI) using iron nanoparticles supported on a porous cation-exchange
resin.15 The process involves a separate
procedure for the preparation of iron nanoparticles and their dispersion
on a polymer support. In another approach, Pd supported on amine-functionalized
SiO2 yielded efficient conversion of Cr(VI).6 However, the method comprises costly chemicals
and tedious catalyst preparation. Lu et al. studied natural clino-pyrrhotite
for reductive removal of Cr(VI).33 For
effective removal of 1 μmol Cr(VI), 0.22 g of the catalyst is
used, and the formation of a larger quantity of sludge is unavoidable.
Such reported approaches resulted in successful conversion of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III). Yet, in most of the protocols, costly chemicals, tedious
procedure of nanoparticle or supported material preparation, and experimentation
under an inert atmosphere are involved. In addition, accumulation
of converted Cr(III) as hydroxide as sludge is inevitable.

The current procedure involves less costly chemicals, simple process,
reusability of the catalytic system, collection of the converted Cr(III),
and its transformation into a useful composite, which eases the sludge
accumulation. Reusability and conversion of the collected residue
into a useful material may certainly help in effective purification
of Cr(VI)-contaminated aqueous medium.

3 Conclusions
The current investigation brings out a facile protocol for the
complete removal of hazardous Cr(VI). The reduction process applies
cost-effective copper oxide and can be carried out in aqueous media
with a wide pH range (2–10). The collected residue after recycling
is successfully converted into a photoactive composite, CuO/CuCr2O4. Testing on simulated tannery wastewater indicates
the absence of interference due to the presence of other ions. Such
an attempt to convert the accumulating residue into a useful product
is significant from the secondary pollution point of view.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of CuO
Reagents used: Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (S.D. Fine chemicals Ltd.,
99%), NH2CONH2 (S.D. Fine chemicals Ltd., 99%),
and NaBH4 (S.D. Fine chemicals Ltd., 98%).

CuO was
prepared by the combustion method. The required amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in minimum
quantity of water, to that, urea was added as fuel, and the mixture
was kept for combustion at 500 °C for 15 min. The collected solid
was kept for calcination at 750 °C for 2 h.

4.2 Characterization
The phase formation
and the precipitated product of Cr(III) were identified by powder
XRD analysis at room temperature using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker
D8 Advanced) with Cu Kα radiation in the scan range of 10–70°.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis (JASCO FT-IR 4100) was
carried out using the KBr pellet technique. UV–vis spectra
and UV–vis–near-infrared absorption characteristics
were obtained using a Jasco spectrophotometer (model V-560). Atomic
absorption spectroscopic analysis of the filtrate was carried out
using Varian AA240.

4.3 Chemical Conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and
Combustion of the Resultant Residue
To 25 mL of dichromate
solution (source: K2Cr2O7) taken
in a beaker, 100 mg of CuO was introduced and kept in the dark for
30 min for equilibration to enable adsorption and desorption processes
(the pH of the solution was noted as 4.8). The freshly prepared sodium
borohydride solution (0.5 M) was introduced and stirred (200 rpm).
The solution was sampled after centrifugation and analyzed by UV–visible
spectroscopy. The parameters varied were as follows: amount of the
catalyst (100, 50, 25, and 2 mg); pH (2, 4.8, and 10); concentration
of dichromate solution (20, 100, and 500 ppm), and the concentration
of sodium borohydride (0.25, 0.125, and 0.0635 M). Control experiments
were carried out with CuO and NaBH4 separately. The residue
collected after the reduction of Cr(VI) was dissolved in 1:1 nitric
acid. The nitrate mixture was combusted using urea as a fuel in a
furnace preheated at 500 °C.

4.4 Photocatalytic Activity of the Composite
To 25 mL (10 ppm) of methyl orange solution taken in a photoreactor
tube, 0.1 g of the composite powder was introduced. The suspension
was stirred in the dark under ambient conditions for 30 min to ensure
the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye molecule
and the composite powder. To the reaction mixture, 100 μL of
hydrogen peroxide (30%) was added and irradiated with UV radiation
of wavelength 365 nm. Small aliquots were collected, centrifuged,
and analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy to determine the degradation
of the dye.
