We investigated the structure and
antireduction of Ti4+ in orthorhombic perovskite Ca0.61Nd0.26TiO3 (CNT) ceramic by doping
with three different additives (Cr2O3, MnO2, and SnO2). The
X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the main phase of orthorhombic
perovskite was formed in all the samples. In addition, the substitution
of M (M = Cr3+, Mn4+, Sn4+) for Ti4+ resulted in the oxygen octahedral distortion and changes
of order degree of B-site, which was confirmed by Raman spectra. The
εr and τf values were concerned
with the average ionicity of B–O bond fi(B-ave) and the linear expansion coefficient α, respectively.
The X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated that three different additives
could restrain the reduction of Ti4+, which was beneficial
to the improvement of the Q × f value for CNT ceramic. High Q × f value of 16 123 GHz was obtained in the CNT + 1 mol % Cr2O3 ceramic compared with Q × f value of 11 207 GHz in pure CNT ceramic.

1 Introduction
Microwave
dielectric ceramics (MWDCs) play a key role in electronic
components, which are used widely in the communication, including
internet of things, software radio, global positioning system, DBS,
radio frequency identification, environmental monitoring via satellite,
etc.1 For example, a dielectric resonator
made of MWDCs is an electromagnetic component that exhibits resonance
for a narrow range of frequencies. The key properties of MWDCs required
for a dielectric resonator are high relative permittivity (εr), high quality factor (Q × f), and a near-zero temperature coefficient of resonant
frequency (τf). Many specific MWDCs should have high
εr value (70–130) and thermal stability to
satisfy the miniaturization of microwave devices, such as CaTiO3-based MWDCs.

The Ca0.61Nd0.26TiO3 (CNT) ceramic
with properties of εr ∼ 108, Q × f ∼ 17 200 GHz, and τf ∼ +270 ppm/°C, originating from CaTiO3 ceramic is thought to be potential and suitable MWDCs applied in
the high-frequency circuit.2 For the needs
of practical application, many literatures concentrated on tuning
the τf value of the CNT ceramic to near zero by substitution
of A or B site in perovskite structure3,4 or combining
other ceramics with opposite τf value.5−8 Nevertheless, little attention has been attached to the improvement
on Q × f values by preventing
reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. Two valence states
of Ti exist in many Ti-based MWDCs sintered in an air atmosphere or
under low oxygen partial pressure, such as TiO2,9 BaZn2Ti4O11,1010 Ba4.2Sm9.2Ti18O54,1111 Na0.5Sm0.5TiO3,12 and so on. The reduction
of Ti4+ can be expressed by following reactions 1   2  As shown in reactions 1 and 2, Ti4+ attracted free electrons and was transformed
into Ti3+. It is reported that the Q × f value of the pure CNT ceramic sintered at high temperature
in air
was under the value of 17 200 GHz due to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+.5,8,13,145,8,13,14 Aiming at solving this
problem, CNT ceramic samples were prepared by doping with 1 mol %
M (M = Cr2O3, MnO2, SnO2). Here, CNT + 1 mol % M (M = Cr2O3, MnO2, SnO2) ceramics, CNT + 1 mol % Cr2O3 ceramic, CNT + 1 mol % MnO2 ceramic, and CNT +
1 mol % SnO2 ceramic were shortened as CNTM ceramics, CNT
+ Cr ceramic, CNT + Mn ceramic, and CNT + Sn ceramic, respectively.
The effects of these additives on the structure and microwave dielectric
properties of CNTM ceramics were studied in this work.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of O 1s and Ti 2p for CNTM
ceramics. As shown in Figure 1a, the asymmetric O 1s XPS spectra of CNTM ceramics were located
at about 530.4 eV, which was consistent with previous studies of TiO2.15 The increases in the O 1s binding
energy was attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancy in ceramics-based
TiO2.16−1816−18 According to reactions 1 and 2, the generation of oxygen
vacancy was accompanied by the generation of free electrons in high-temperature
sintering. Then, Ti3+ was formed, which lowered the Ti4+ 2p energy levels. As depicted in Figure 1b, the Ti4+ 2p binding energy
increased to different degrees when different additives were doped
in CNT ceramic, suggesting the reduction of Ti4+ was suppressed.
The mechanism of antirestraint of Ti4+ reduction to Ti3+ could be explained by following equations 3   4  where N is a metal cation. Additionally, as
shown in Figure 1s, the position for Mn
2p3/2 was at 640.8 eV, and lower than that in literature,
suggesting tetravalent Mn was reduced. This could be explained by
the fact that the Mn ions in CNT ceramic sintered at high temperature
in air showed mixed valence states (2+, 3+, 4+). N is Cr and Mn in
this work. So, the substitution of bivalent or trivalent ions for
Ti4+ would suppress the generation of the oxygen vacancies
and then restrain to produce electrons based on reaction 1.

their optimal temperatures.
(b) XPS of Ti 2p for CNTM ceramics sintered at their optimal temperatures.

Figure 2 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs and the bulk density
of CNTM ceramics. As illustrated in Figure 2a–d, the large grains of about 100
μm dominated in all compositions, and the small grains were
distributed around the large grains. Obviously, the grain size of
CNT + Cr ceramic was slightly smaller than of CNT ceramic, which was
explained by the inhibition of Cr for the grain growth in CNT + Cr
ceramic.19 Compared with the CNT ceramic,
less tiny grains were distributed around the large grains in the CNT
+ Sn ceramic. It is reported that SnO2 addition with few
amounts could promote the grain growth in Ca0.6La0.8/3TiO3 ceramics.20 Similarly,
the tiny grains became less, and grain distribution was compact for
the CNT + Sn ceramic. Furthermore, the variation in bulk density revealed
that the large grain microstructure contributed to the densification
in CNTM ceramics. The CNT + Sn ceramic showed the most compact grain
distribution compared with other composition, but did not present
the highest bulk density value. This discrepancy may be ascribed to
the pore in the CNT + Sn ceramic.

(d) for CNT + Sn ceramic, and (e) variation in the bulk densities

The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the CNTM ceramics are shown
in Figure 3a. Pure
orthorhombic-perovskite-structured CaTiO3 phase was formed
in CNT and CNT + Mn ceramics with a Pnma(62) space group, which is well-indexed to JCPDS #88-0082. However,
for CNT + Cr and CNT + Sn ceramics, there was minor amount of TiO2 secondary phase in CNT + Cr ceramic and Ti0.7Sn0.3O2 secondary phase in CNT + Sn ceramic, which
was shown in Figure 3b. To further study the variations in the structural parameters of
orthorhombic-perovskite phase, Rietveld refinement was carried out. Figure 4 shows the X-ray
patterns for CNTM ceramics after Rietveld refinement, and the crystallographic
parameters of CNTM ceramics are shown in Table 1. As presented in Figure 5, the trend of lattice parameters in CNTM
ceramics were the result of substitution of Cr3+ (0.615
Å, CN = 6), Mn4+ (0.53 Å, CN = 6), and Sn4+ (0.69 Å, CN = 6) with Ti4+ (0.605 Å,
CN = 6) at the B-site. In addition, the substitution of M (M = Cr3+, Mn4+, Sn4+) with Ti4+ resulted
in the shift in the (121) lattice plane peaks based on the Bragg’s
law (2d sin θ = nλ), which is illustrated in Figure 3a.

According to the crystallographic parameters, the
schematic representation
of the CNT ceramic and its oxygen octahedron are presented in Figure 6. The CNT crystal
constituted of Ti–O octahedrons, and Ca and Nd cations occupied
the 4c Wyckoff positions in the octahedral interstice. The bond length
between the Ti cation and O anion was nonequivalent in the same Ti–O
octahedron, which resulted in the tilting of the Ti–O octahedrons.

(release of distorted oxygen octahedrons in the inset).

As is known, the spectra of structural variations
can be detected
by Raman spectrometer. In this work, Raman analysis was performed
to confirm the structural evolution of the CNTM ceramics. According
to the crystal structure data, the optic modes of CaTiO3 with orthorhombic Pnma(62) space
group can be predicted by the Group theory and represented as: Γoptic = 7Ag (R) + 8Au (s) + 5B1g (R) + 9B1u (IR) + 7B2g (R) + 7B2u (IR) + 5B3g (R) + 9B3u (IR). Twenty-four Raman-active
modes (7Ag + 5B1g + 7B2g + 5B3g) can be expected. Nevertheless, there are 30 Raman-active
modes (9Ag + 6B1g + 9B2g + 6B3g) in the CNT ceramic. This discrepancy was ascribed to the
decrease in crystal symmetry as Nd3+ partially substituted
for Ca2+ at the A-site in the CaTiO3 crystal.
Normally, not all of the Raman modes were identified in this experiment.
Some peaks were annihilated due to weak signals.21

As shown in Figure 7a, seven Raman-active modes of CNTM ceramics were measured,
which
appear as peaks at 133, 230, 326, 470, 549, 676, and 763 cm–1. Here, seven modes were numbered M1–M7. The M7 at 763 cm–1 represented an Ag mode.22 The M6 and M5 at approximately 676 and 549 cm–1, respectively, corresponded to the Ti–O stretching mode.23 The M4 at 470 cm–1 was related
to the internal vibration in oxygen cage.23,24 The peaks in the range 200–350 cm–1 (M2,
M3) were related to the rotations of the oxygen cage and those in
less than 200 cm–1 (M1) were associated with the
motion of the A-site cations.

of distorted oxygen octahedrons in the CNTM ceramics.

Figure 7c shows
the Raman shift of modes in the CNTM ceramics. As different additives
were doped in CNT ceramic, the Raman shifts of M2, M4, M5, and M6
indicated the changed trend in the unit cell volume, which conformed
to the shift of diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns.25,26 As shown in Figure 7a, the intensity of M7 in CNT + Cr ceramic was significantly distinct
from other compositions, and the position of M7 dramatically moved
from 763 to 773 cm–1 compared with that in CNT ceramic.
Zheng et al.27 proposed that M7 was related
to the B-site ordering in complex perovskites. In our compositions,
the M7 was generated on account of difference in the B-site ordering
influenced by the distribution of cation (Ca, Nd) and vacancy at the
A-site.28 Besides, their distribution would
be affected by the valence of the substitutional cation for Ti4+ in CNT + Cr ceramic, which may play a key role in the M7
mode intensity.

The Mo–O bond structural information
can be presented by
the Raman spectra in the metal oxide molecule,29 which was expressed by eq 5 5  where s is the Raman shift
and RMo–O is the Mo–O bond
length. Therefore, we have made a guess, and eq 5 could show the relationship between Raman
shift and bond length for the B-site bonds in CNT + Mn ceramics. As
shown in Figure 7b,c,
it is clear that the Raman shifts of M5 and M6 were in accordance
with the trend of B–O1 and B–O22 bond length
based on eq 5. However,
the different changing tendency of bond length was observed between
the B–O21 bond and the B–O1 or B–O22 bond. In CNTM ceramics, Ti4+ and Cr3+, Ti4+ and Mn4+, or Ti4+ and Sn4+ were occupied randomly at the B-site. Two adjacent oxygen
octahedrons may become nonequivalent and the state of stabilization
of two adjacent oxygen octahedrons was broken because of the differences
of ionic sizes between Ti4+ and Cr3+, Mn4+ or Sn4+, which led to the structural distortion
of oxygen octahedrons. The variation in oxygen octahedron with different
additives for CNTM ceramics is shown in Figure 7e. The octahedral distortion (δoct) was calculated from eq 6 based on the individual bond distance of the B-site 6  where Ri is an
individual bond distance and R̅ is the average
bond distance at the B-site. As presented in Figure 7e, different additives have different impact
on the oxygen octahedron, especially the B–O21 bond.
The δoct reflected the differences in bond length
between three B–O bonds in the oxygen octahedron. Therefore,
CNT + Sn ceramic presented a more distorted oxygen octahedron with
the highest δoct value (as shown in Figure 7d) in all compositions. In
addition, electronegativity of the B-site cations may affect the Ag mode (M7) frequency and the lineshape through B–O
bond lengths.

Nowadays, complex chemical bond theory has been
applied in discussing
the relationships of crystal structure, properties, and chemical bonds
such as ATiNb2O8 (A = Mg, Zn)30 and LnNbO4 (Ln = La, Nd).31−33 However, few
studies were reported about this aspect for CNT ceramic. In this article,
the bond ionicity (fi) and the coefficient
of thermal expansion (α) of CNTM ceramics were calculated based
on this theory.

Figure 8a presents
the εr values and the bulk density in the CNTM ceramics
sintered at their optimal temperatures. The εr and
bulk density variation with different additives showed the same trend
in the CNTM ceramics, which revealed that εr was
closely related to the bulk density for CNTM ceramics. Additionally,
Batsanov et al.34 proposed that the relationship
between permittivity and bond ionicity could be expressed as 7  where n is the refractive
index. According to the previous structure analysis, the additives
primarily affected oxygen octahedrons at the B-site. Therefore, the
average bond ionicity at the B-site (fi(B-ave)) was calculated. As shown in Figure 8a, the εr and fi(B-ave) values showed the same changing tendency with
different additives, which confirmed the bond ionicity has a close
relationship with the relative permittivity. Although the second phases
were formed in CNT + Cr and CNT + Sn ceramics, the εr values of TiO2 and Ti0.7Sn0.3O2 were both higher than that of CNT ceramic,9 implying that the second phase was not a factor of decreasing
εr value in CNT + Cr and CNT + Sn ceramics.

Figure 8 (a) εr values, bulk density, and fi(B-ave)
values in the CNTM ceramics sintered at their
optimal temperatures. (b) The τf values, α
values, and octahedron distortion (δoct) in the CNTM
ceramics sintered at their optimal temperatures.

There have been many researches on the relationship among
τf and distorted oxygen octahedrons,21,25,35 which indicated that positive
τf value decreased due to more tilted and distorted
oxygen octahedrons.
Although CNT + Sn ceramic presented the highest δoct value, its τf value was not the lowest, as shown
in Figure 8b. As is
well known, the τf value has a close relationship
with the thermal expansion coefficient (α) and temperature coefficient
of the relative permittivity (τε): τf = −τε/2 – α. Hence,
the α values of CNTM ceramics were calculated by the complex
chemical bond theory. As shown in Figure 8b, α and τf present
two contradictory trends with different additives, indicating an important
role of α in τf.

As shown in reactions 1 and 2, most perovskite ceramics easily formed
a large number of oxygen vacancies sintered in low oxygen tension
such as reducing atmosphere or at high sintering temperature. The Q × f microwave properties of CNT
ceramic were deteriorated by excessive oxygen vacancies. Thus, the
Ti 2p XPS spectra of CNTM ceramics were fitted, and fitting curves
are shown in Figure 9a. For the CNT ceramic sintered in air, two valence states of Ti
element could be detected, and the Ti3+ 2p3/2 and Ti4+ 2p3/2 peaks were observed at ∼457.8
and ∼458.7 eV, respectively. The Ti3+ content ratio
in total Ti content can be calculated by eq 8 using the area of the its peaks (Ti3+ 2p3/2 and Ti3+ 2p1/2). 8  A(Ti3+ 2p3/2), A(Ti4+ 2p3/2), A(Ti4+ 2p1/2), and A(Ti3+ 2p1/2) refer
to their individual peaks
area. The calculated A values are shown in Table 2. The mechanism of
antireduction of Ti4+ could be explained by eq 3 in CNT + Cr and CNT + Mn ceramics.
For CNT + Sn ceramic, tetravalent Sn ion substituted for tetravalent
Ti ion and the second phase Ti0.7Sn0.3O2 was formed, which decreased the Ti content. This may be a
cause of antireduction of Ti4+. The A value
of the CNT + Cr ceramic is zero, which implied there was no Ti3+ in ceramic, and the Q × f value was highest among all the samples. Besides, more research
was needed into the different suppression force of Ti3+ in CNT ceramic doped with different additives (Cr2O3, MnO2, SnO2).

3 Conclusions
In the present work, CNT
ceramics doped with different additives
were explored. The XRD patterns and Raman spectra demonstrated that
Cr, Mn, and Sn ions partially substituted Ti ions in the B-site, and
the structural distortion of oxygen octahedrons became stronger in
CNTM ceramics. Also, CNT + Sn ceramic presented the shortest bond
length of B–O21. The εr and τf values were dependent on the average B-site bond ionicity fi(B-ave) and the linear expansion coefficient
α respectively. The XPS spectra indicated that Ti3+ existed on account of the generation of oxygen vacancy in pure CNT
ceramic sintered at high temperature. Furthermore, and Cr2O3, MnO2, and SnO2 were verified
to effectively suppress Ti3+ generation, contributing to
the improvement of the Q × f value in CNT ceramic.

4 Experimental Section
The Reagent-grade raw materials—CaCO3, Nd2O3, TiO2, Cr2O3, MnO2, and SnO2 powders—were proportionately
weighed in accordance with Ca0.61Nd0.26TiO3 + 1 mol % M (M = Cr2O3, MnO2, SnO2) (CNTM) chemical formula. Like traditional solid-state
reaction method, the raw materials need to be ball mixed with deionized
water using planetary. After drying, the resulting mixtures were calcined
at 1130 °C for 5 h in alumina crucibles with an intermediate
grinding to avoid the impurity phase. Then, the calcined mixtures
were uniaxially pressed into pellets directly with dimension of 15
mm diameter and 7 mm thickness PVA. After removing the binder at 600
°C, the samples sintered at 1350–1450 °C for 4 h
in air. The heating rate was set to 5 °C/min. The cooling rate
were controlled at 2 °C/min until the 1000 °C and then naturally
cooled to room temperature.

Archimedes method was used to calculate
the bulk density of the
ceramics. The XRD data were obtained using X-ray diffraction (XRD,
XRD-7000, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation over
a 2θ range of 10–80° with a step of 0.013°.
And the phase analysis was performed by Rietveld refinement using
GSAS and EXPGUI software. The microstructure was observed by scanning
electron microscope (SEM, Sirion 200, Netherlands). The Raman signal
of samples with different preparation process and doping content was
collected at room temperature and recorded by a DXR microscope Raman
spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution). The 10 mW output of the 532 nm
line of He–Ne laser was used as the excitation source. The
obtained Raman spectra exhibited a resolution of approximately 2 cm–1. The dielectric constant was measured by the Hakki–Coleman
method, and the unload Q × f value was measured by the cavity method using a network analyzer
(E8362B, Agilent Technologies). The τf value was
measured from the difference between the resonant frequency at 25
and 85 °C. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific
ESCALAB 250Xi) was used to identify the valency of Ti and O ions with
Al Kα (monochromatic) radiation. And, the XPS spectra were calibrated
by positions of the C 1s peaks compared with the binding energy of
284.8 eV.
