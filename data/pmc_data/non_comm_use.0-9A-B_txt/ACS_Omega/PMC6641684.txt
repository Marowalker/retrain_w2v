A water-soluble nonfluorescent cationic
conjugated polyelectrolyte
poly(1,1′-((1,4-phenylenebis(oxy))bis(propane-3,1-diyl))bis(pyridin-1-ium)bromide)
(PPPy) was specifically synthesized via an economical method of oxidative
coupling polymerization in high yields. PPPy selectively recognized
nitroexplosive picric acid (PA) by fluorescence “turn-on”
in the presence of closely related nitroexplosive compounds, namely,
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 4-nitrophenol via fluorescence
indicator displacement assay (IDA) technique in water at pH 7.0. The
polymer PPPy was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, gel permeable
chromatography, UV–vis spectroscopy. The polymer PPPy forms
an electrostatic complex with uranine dye. This ensemble scheme was
utilized to detect PA with a limit of detection value of 295 nM (solution
state) and 0.22 ppm (vapor state) through IDA, a phenomenon that is
very different from the widely reported Förster resonance energy
transfer, photoinduced electron transfer, ground-state charge transfer
and inner filter effect based probes used for nitroexplosive PA detection.

==== Body
Introduction
2,4,6-Trinitrophenol,
commonly referred as picric acid (PA), has
been categorized as a strong nitroexplosive compound (Scheme S1). The potential explosive power of
PA is remarkably superior than that of other competitive and interfering
nitroexplosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Thus, its detection is
of immense significance for homeland security and forensic investigation.1,2 Owing to its high solubility in water and extensive use in dye,
leather, drugs, matchbox, and firework industries, it can easily contaminate
land and water resources.3 PA is a well-known
environmental pollutant that has lower degradation rate in biosystems
and can cause severe health problems such as cancer, abnormal liver
functions, sycosis, and damage to kidney as well as respiratory
organs.4,5 Furthermore, during metabolism, PA is transformed
into picramic acid, which has even much higher mutagenic activity
than PA.6 Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop superior methods with high selectivity, rapid detection
probes, and high sensitivity for PA detection with respect to environmental
issues and terrorist threats.

Host/guest chemistry is a very
active area of research in supramolecular
chemistry.7−11 The change in the response of host/dye complex property after the
addition of particular analyte has been extensively investigated to
build a selective and sensitive chemosensor.12−23 Fluorescent dyes possess high affinity for macrocyclic host and
significant change in fluorescence is observed after the host/dye
complex formation in water medium.9,15,22 When an analyte is introduced into the host/dye complex,
it selectively displaces the dye from the host and forms a host/analyte
complex with an initial fluorescence recovery. This phenomenon is
generally termed as indicator displacement assay (IDA). There is competition
between the analyte and the indicator for the selective binding of
the host.10,17 Several host/dye complex-based sensing with
a variety of hosts used, such as calixarenes,9,10,20,22 cyclodextrins,15 cucurbiturils,10,19,22 and pillararene,21 have
been reported. However, no report is available till date with a cationic
conjugate polymer as a host. Notably, the IDA technique has been widely
used for selective sensing of biological and environmental analytes
such as basic amino acids,19 adrafinil,24 heparin,25 carbohydrate,26 citrate,27,28 phosphate,29−31 tartarate,32,33 nitrate,34 and so on.

Several literature methods are available for the
sensitive detection
of PA; however, most of them use organic media35−41 and fluorescence “turn-off” and lack good selectivity
toward PA,37,42−44 with selected
reports available based on fluorescence “turn-on” sensing.45−51 The mechanisms of sensing involved in the previous reports are majorly
photoinduced electron transfer and/or energy transfer process52−54 and inner filter effect.55 To the best
of our knowledge, there are no reports available for the sensitive
PA (solution and vapor) detection based on fluorescence turn-on via
IDA. In this work, we introduce a straightforward method to synthesize
pyridinium receptor containing nonfluorescent cationic conjugated
polymer poly(1,1′-((1,4-phenylenebis(oxy))bis(propane-3,1-diyl))bis(pyridin-1-ium)bromide
(PPPy) (Scheme 1),
which shows selective fluorescence turn-on sensing of PA over 2,4-dinitrophenol
(2,4-DNP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and TNT through the IDA technique
in water at pH 7.0 for the first time (Scheme 2).

Results and Discussion
The cationic
polymer PPPy was obtained via postfunctionalization
polymerization method (Scheme 1 and Figures S1–S8). Pyridinium
group strapped along the side chains of the PPPy makes the polymer
highly soluble in polar solvents such as methanol, water, and so on,
and also provides specific recognition site for PA because of attractive
electrostatic interactions. The cationic polymer PPPy shows an absorbance
maximum at 319 nm and does not emit any kind of fluorescence in water
buffered with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES,
pH 7.0, 0.01 M). The indicator used in the IDA studies is UD (Scheme 1), which has the
absorbance and fluorescence maxima at 490 and 513 nm (excitation 490
nm), respectively, in water buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0, 0.01 M).
The concentration of UD for every titration experiment was fixed at
6.6 × 10–6 M. In the preliminary experiment,
the fluorescence of UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) in water
buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0, 0.01 M) was measured in the presence
of various concentrations of PPPy (1.6 × 10–6, 3.3 × 10–6, 5.0 × 10–6, 6.66 × 10–6, 8.3 × 10–6, 10.0 × 10–6, 11.6 × 10–6, 13.3 × 10–6, 15.0 × 10–6, and 16.6 × 10–6 M) (Figure 1a). The
fluorescence intensity of UD gradually quenched on further addition
of PPPy, and 86% of the quenching occurred after the addition of PPPy
in 16.6 × 10–6 M concentration. It should be
noted that the addition of monomer M2 (Scheme 1) to the solution of UD barely affected its
fluorescence intensity (Figure S9). This
proved the high affinity of PPPy toward UD. The UV–vis spectra
of UD were studied after adding PPPy in varying concentrations (1.6
× 10–6, 3.3 × 10–6,
5.0 × 10–6, 6.66 × 10–6, 8.3 × 10–6, 10.0 × 10–6, 11.6 × 10–6, 13.3 × 10–6, 15.0 × 10–6, and 16.6 × 10–6 M) (Figure 1b). The
absorbance maxima of UD (490 nm) was red shifted by 12 nm to 502 nm.
This new peak at 502 nm in the UV–vis spectrum was indicative
of the host/dye complex, that is, the PPPy/UD complex.

Scheme 2 Mechanism of PA Turn-On Sensor
To examine the displacement
of the indicator, UD, from the cationic
conjugated polymer PPPy, the IDA studies were done for PA, carried
out in cuvettes, keeping the fixed concentration of resulting solution
of PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M)/UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) complex in water buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0,
0.01 M) by varying the concentration of PA. In typical IDA studies,
fluorescence spectra of PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M)/UD
(6.6 × 10–6 M) complex were recorded at various
concentrations of analyte PA (16.6 × 10–6,
33.3 × 10–6, 50.0 × 10–6, 66.6 × 10–6, 83.3 × 10–6, 100.0 × 10–6, 116.6 × 10–6, 133.3 × 10–6, 150.0 × 10–6, and 166.6 × 10–6 M) (Figure 2a). The fluorescence intensity increased
gradually with the addition of PA, and 86% dequenching occurred after
the addition of PA in 166.6 × 10–6 M concentration.
The UV–vis spectra of PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M)/UD(6.6 × 10–6 M) complex were recorded
upon the addition of various concentrations of PA (16.6 × 10–6, 33.3 × 10–6, 50.0 ×
10–6, 66.6 × 10–6, 83.3 ×
10–6, 100.0 × 10–6, 116.6
× 10–6, 133.3 × 10–6, 150.0 × 10–6, and 166.6 × 10–6 M) (Figure 2b). The
absorbance maximum of UD/PPPy complex (502 nm) is blue shifted back
to 490 nm, indicating the displacement of UD from the PPPy/UD complex.

and UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) complex with increasing

UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) and PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M) complex with increasing concentrations of PA (166.6

7.0, 0.01 M).

In addition, the limit
of detection (LOD) was calculated to be
295 nM based on the change in the emission spectrum of the PPPy (16.6
× 10–6 M)/UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) complex at various concentrations of PA (3.3 × 10–6, 6.6 × 10–6, 10.0 × 10–6, 13.3 × 10–6, 16.6 × 10–6, and 20.0 × 10–6 M) by using the equation
3σ/K (Figure S10), which is being reported for the first time by means of the IDA
technique via a conjugated polymer–dye system (Table S1). The photograph of UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) solution (Figure 3a) in HEPES (pH 7.0, 0.01 M) was taken in natural light with successive
additions of PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M) (Figure 3b) and PA (166.6
× 10–6 M) (Figure 3c). Similarly, the photographs of vertical
view of their respective solution were taken in the presence of 490
nm emission wavelength source using Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer
(Figure 3).

10–6 M) in natural light, respectively. (d–f)

To elucidate the selectivity, fluorescent IDA studies were
performed
by adding various common interfering analytes, namely, 2,4-DNP, 4-NP,
TNT, research department explosive (RDX), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene
(2,6-DNT), 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), benzoic
acid (BA), NB, and phenol to the solution of PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M)/UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) complex
in water buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0, 0.01 M) (Figures 4a and S11). Interestingly,
no significant change was seen in the PL spectra of PPPy/UD complex
after the addition of these analytes. Furthermore, other metal ions
(Fe3+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Co3+, Cr2+, Pb2+, and Mn2+) as well as anions (H2PO4–, HPO42–, PO43–,
I–, Cl–, F–,
NO3–, N3–, BF4–, and AcO–)
did not have any effect on the fluorescence of PPPy/UD complex (Figures 4b,c, S12, and S13), which confirms the high selectivity
of PPPy toward PA in the IDA studies. Sensing studies were also done
in a competitive environment. In a typical set of experiment, a solution
of 2,4-DNP (166.6 × 10–6 M) was added initially
to the solution of PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M)/UD
(6.6 × 10–6 M) complex in water buffered with
HEPES (pH 7.0, 0.01 M), but no substantial change in the emission
intensity was seen (Figure S14). The solution
of PA (166.6 × 10–6 M) was then introduced
to the same solution, which resulted in significant enhancement in
fluorescence. The same sets of experiments were repeated with other
nitroaromatic compounds and similar fluorescence turn-on response
was obtained after the addition of PA (Figures S15–S24). It is worth mentioning that most of the existing
chemosensor systems developed for the detection of PA suffered from
a large interference by several other electron-deficient nitroaromatic
compounds, particularly 2,4-DNP, 4-NP, and TNT. The present method
provides a simple, rapid, reliable, and highly specific detection
of PA even in a competitive environment.

10–6 M)/UD (6.6 × 10–6 M)
complex.

Vapor-phase detection of PA was
also carried out by using PPPy.
Fixed volumes of PA vapors of concentration (0.018 ppm, 50 mL) were
purged through the UD/PPPy complex using a leak-proof syringe. The
PL spectra were recorded after the purging of PA vapors in the cuvette
and the increase in the emission maxima observed with each addition
(Figures 5 and S25) were recorded. Furthermore, the LOD value
was calculated to be 0.220 ppm based on the change in the emission
spectrum of the PPPy (16.6 × 10–6 M)/UD (6.6
× 10–6 M) complex at various concentrations
of PA vapors (0.316, 0.632, 0.948, 1.264, 1.580, and 1.896 ppm) using
the equation 3σ/K (Figure S26). Thus, the present method established a rapid and specific
detection of PA in the vapor phase as well, which remains a highly
challenging and an exciting area of research.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a nonfluorescent
cationic conjugated polymer was
demonstrated to selectively detect PA among other closely related
electron-deficient nitroaromatic compounds like 2,4-DNP, 4-NP, and
TNT via fluorescent turn-on IDA using UD as the indicator for the
first time. The ensemble system could be used to detect PA with a
LOD of 295 nM in water buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0, 0.01 M) and 0.22
ppm in the vapor state. The addition of PA thus led to a quick fluorescence
turn-on response of the PPPy/UD complex even at very low concentrations.
This fluorescence turn-on based system avoids the erroneous false
signals and significantly improves the detection sensitivity as compared
with the assays that work on the fluorescence quenching methods.

Sensing Studies in Aqueous Solution
The stock solutions
of the polymer PPPy and other analytes, namely, NB, nitromethane,
BA, 4-NP, phenol, and 2,4-DNP, were prepared in Milli-Q water at concentrations
of 1 × 10–3 and 1 × 10–2 M, respectively. Stock solutions of other nitroaromatics, namely,
2,6-DNT, 2,4-DNT, 4-NT, and 1,3-DNB, were prepared at concentrations
of 1 × 10–2 M in high-performance liquid chromatography
grade tetrahydrofuran. Stock solutions of TNT and RDX were prepared
at concentration of 1 × 10–2 M in 1:1 CH3CN/MeOH. The absorption measurements and the PL titrations
of UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) with different concentrations
of the polymer PPPy were carried out by sequentially adding various
concentrations of the polymer PPPy (1.6 × 10–6, 3.3 × 10–6, 5.0 × 10–6, 6.66 × 10–6, 8.3 × 10–6, 10.0 × 10–6, 11.6 × 10–6, 13.3 × 10–6, 15.0 × 10–6, and 16.6 × 10–6 M) to a 3 mL water medium
buffered with HEPES (0.01 M, pH 7.0) containing 6.6 × 10–6 M of UD in a quartz cuvette of 10 mm path length.
The resultant mixtures were mixed thoroughly before recording the
spectra at rt.

Titration Conditions
All of the
UV–vis and PL
titrations were carried out in aqueous solutions buffered with HEPES
(pH 7.0, 0.01 M). The concentration of the fluorophore–UD was
kept constant at 6.6 × 10–6 M throughout the
fluorescence titrations.

Calculation of Detection Limit
For
calculating the
detection limit, different solutions of the polymer PPPy (16.6 ×
10–6 M) and UD (6.6 × 10–6 M) each containing PA (3.3× 10–6, 6.6 ×
10–6, 10.0 × 10–6, 13.3 ×
10–6, 16.6 × 10–6, and 20.0
× 10–6 M) were taken individually in HEPES
buffer (pH 7.0, 0.01 M) and then the emission spectrum was obtained
for individual sample by exciting at 490 nm. A calibration plot was
obtained between the fluorescence intensity and the increasing concentration
of PA to get a regression curve equation. From the calibration curve,
the LOD was evaluated using the equation 3σ/K, where σ denotes the standard deviation for the intensity
of UD and PPPy in the absence of PA and K is the
slope of the curve.

Vapor-Phase Detection
Hundred milligrams
of dried PA
was taken in an airtight flask and kept for 2 days at rt and maintained
at 40 °C for 15 min before titration so that the air inside the
flask gets completely saturated with PA vapors. The vapor pressure
(P) of PA was calculated using the integrated form
of Clausius–Clapeyron equation (log10 P = A – B/T).56,57 Here, A and B are the two conventionally used fitting parameters. Furthermore,
the concentration of PA vapors was also calculated by the following
equation: saturation concentration (ppm) = P (mmHg)/760
mmHg × 106, where P represents the
vapor pressure of PA.53 For each titration,
the concentration of PA vapors was kept constant (i.e., 0.018 ppm,
50 mL) and purged through cuvette using a leak-proof syringe.
