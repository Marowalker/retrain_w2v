In this work, a simple and scalable
method was presented to decorate
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) by atomic
layer deposition (ALD) for field emission (FE) application. The size
and distribution of NPs were precisely controlled by adjusting the
number of ALD cycles. It was discovered that a higher cycle number
of ALD resulted in continuously increased conductivity of the CNTs@Pt
nanocomposite. It could be explained by not only the increased loading
of Pt NPs but also by the gradually decreased presence of the PtO
compound in NPs. As a result, a significant improvement in the FE
characteristics of the cold cathode was observed because of the decoration
of CNTs with metal NPs. The higher number of ALD cycles resulted in
the gradual lowering of the turn-on electric field which reached a
minimum value of ∼0.43 V/μm after 100 cycles of ALD.

Introduction
Since their discovery
in 1991 by Iijima, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
have attracted great interest in most fields of science and engineering
given their unique physical and chemical properties.1−3 For instance, due to the low electron affinity and relatively low
effective work function in addition to the high electrical and thermal
conductivities, mechanical strength, excellent chemical stability,
and exceptionally high aspect ratio, CNTs have been considered as
one of the most promising candidates for a cold cathode field emitter.4

In recent years, several approaches to
improve field emission (FE)
properties of CNTs and to make them suit the present needs were reported.
Among them doping, coating, thermal annealing, cutting, and tip treatment
of CNTs deserved special attention as it proved to be an efficient
tool to not only greatly decrease its turn-on electric field but also
to extend its stability for tens of hours.5 For instance, Sun et al. reported that annealing at 900 °C
could influence significantly on FE properties of CNTs.4 In turn, the surface modification of CNTs by
decorating with metal nanoparticles (NPs) was discovered to be one
of the most effective methods to enhance FE performance.6 In particular, it was reported that the modification
of the electronic structure of CNTs by decoration of its surface with
Co, Ti, Pd, W, and Ru NPs resulted in highly increased density of
states near the Fermi level, which was caused by charge transfer and
orbital hybridization.6,7 As a result, the FE properties
of such composite structures improved significantly compared with
that of pristine CNTs. Yet, it is still unclear how the size and chemical
composition of metal NPs can influence and control the FE characteristics
of CNTs, as most of the published reports concentrated on searching
for new materials or compounds to decorate the surface of CNTs, while
a detailed experimental investigation of their structural particularities
and its correlation with improved performance of CNTs was covered
insufficiently.8,9 Another important issue which
needs to be raised is that to fully and uniformly decorate CNTs with
metal NPs at a size of several nanometers given to a dense forest
structure, high-aspect ratio morphology, and profound layered thickness
of CNTs can be a nontrivial and challenging task. Often the reported
methods, such as, for example, the magnetron sputtering6 or chemical reduction method7 might suffer from low conformability or inability to precisely
control the size of NPs down to several nanometers.

To solve
this problem, in this work, we demonstrated the employment
of the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to prepare CNTs decorated
with sized- and composition-controlled Pt NPs. Because of its sequential,
self-limiting surface reactions, the ALD brings various advantages
over other alternative deposition techniques such as, for example,
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition, not
to mention others.10 In fact, ALD provides
excellent step coverage and unprecedented conformality on high-aspect
ratio structures, control over thickness at an atomic-scale level,
and tunable film composition and stoichiometry.11 The platinum as model metal NPs to deposit on the surface
of CNTs was chosen due to its great potential in related fields such
as fuel cells and electrocatalysts.12 Furthermore,
platinum recommended itself as an efficient material to enhance the
FE characteristics of other materials such as, for example, SiO2 nanowires.13 Overall, it is believed
that the CNTs@Pt composite might have great potential for practical
application as an efficient field emitter.

Experimental Section
The catalyst for the growth of CNTs was prepared by mixing iron
nitrate, tetrabutyl titanate, and n-propanol. More
details can be found in our previous work.14 The solutions were vigorously stirred for 1 h and later sonicated
for 30 min to completely dissolve the iron nitrate. An n-type silicon
wafer (100) was used as a substrate material for the growth of CNTs.
The substrate was first rinsed in acetone and later was blown with
clean, dry, and compressed nitrogen. In the following step, the catalyst
was spin-coated on the substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s. The coated
wafers were quickly placed on the Mo substrate upside down and transferred
into home-made microwave plasma-enhanced CVD (MPCVD). Prior to deposition,
the reaction chamber was evacuated to ∼3 × 10–2 Torr by a mechanical pump. CNTs were deposited with a microwave
power of 800 W at 40 Torr using the mixture of CH4/H2/N which flow rates were controlled at 20, 40, and 50 sccm,
respectively. The temperature inside the reaction chamber was raised
naturally by plasma ignition. It reached 449 °C in the end of
deposition. Once the sample with grown carbon nanostructures was naturally
cooled down, it was immediately subjected to the oxygen plasma treatment,
which was held at a power of 600 W and flow rate of 20 sccm. As it
is not easy to trigger the attachment of Pt NPs on pristine CNTs by
ALD due to their inert surface, to apply the postsynthesis oxygen
plasma treatment is a necessary step to tailor the surface chemical
composition of CNTs.15 After several attempts,
the duration of plasma treatment was chosen ∼5 s, as longer
time seriously affects the morphology of carbon nanostructures, while
shorter time results in insufficient density of functional groups.
Next, the sample was directly transferred to the home-made ALD (Syskey
Technology) for the synthesis of Pt NPs. To complete this process,
(methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum (MeCpPtMe3) and
oxygen were used as the precursors. The Pt precursor was held in a
stainless-steel bubbler at 46 °C, and oxygen was maintained at
room temperature. The durations of pulse time of MeCpPtMe3 and O2 were 1.5 and 5.0 s, respectively. After each pulse
of the precursor, a purge with nitrogen for 15 s was performed. The
ALD of Pt was conducted at 280 °C and the total numbers of cycles
were 25, 50, and 100 cycles. Following this, after deposition, the
samples were named as CNTs@Pt25, CNTs@Pt50, and CNTs@Pt100, respectively.
The fabrication procedure schematic is shown in Figure 1.

of the CNTs@Pt
nanocomposite.

The morphologies and the microstructures
of the samples were characterized
by the FE scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU-8010) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-ARM200FTH). The size
of Pt NPs was evaluated statistically by measuring a diameter of 160
random NPs for each designated cycle number. The phases and crystal
structures were analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (TTRAX
III, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation and an incident angle of
0.5°. The high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS)
analysis of the samples was performed using a PHI Quantera AES 650
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, which was equipped with a hemispherical
energy analyzer. The residual gas pressure in a chamber during data
acquisition was lower than 1 × 10–8 Torr. The
spectra were measured at room temperature using a monochromatic Al
Kα X-ray source (25.5 W, spot size is 100 micrometer), a take-off
angle of 45°, and pass energy of 280 eV. A conductive atomic
force microscope (Bruker, Dimension ICON, scan rate 1 Hz, resonant
frequency 1.3 MHz) attached with peak-force tunneling mode (PF-TUNA)
was used at an applied bias of 0.8 V to probe the electrical currents
of CNTs before and after coating with Pt NPs. The utilization of this
mode requires the use of a substrate with enough conductivity to pass
the current to the sample while it also should not be too conductive
because complete saturation of the current might occur.16,17 Thus, it is justified the choice of Si wafer as a substrate for
measurement of CNTs electrical properties.

The FE characteristics
of the materials were measured using Keithley
2410, 2290, and 6485 systems in a high-vacuum chamber under a pressure
of 3 × 10–6 Torr. For the measuring of the
FE characteristics, the distance between the anode and cathode was
kept at 300 μm and the area of the tungsten anode was 0.03 cm2.

Results and Discussion
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was performed to
determine the chemical modification of CNTs before and after oxygen
plasma treatment. The XPS survey scan spectra for both CNTs are shown
in Figure 2a. The peak
located at 284.5 eV in all spectra is due to the photoelectrons emitted
from the C 1s core level, and the peak at 535.0 eV is generated by
those from the O 1s core level. The concentrations of carbon and oxygen
calculated from spectra were 91.8 and 8.2% versus 88.4 and 11.6% for
CNTs before and after plasma treatment, respectively. It is seen that
the concentration of oxygen increases after plasma treatment while
that of carbon decreases at the same time. This suggests that oxygen
is successfully grafted onto the CNT surface, which is in accordance
with a previous report.15Figure 2b,c shows the HRXPS C 1s spectra
of CNTs before and after plasma treatment. In order to further explain
the process of plasma oxidation, the C 1s peak was deconvoluted into
three component Gaussian peaks, a C–C bond at 284.6 eV, a C–O
bond at 285.4 eV, and an O–C=O bond at 287.7 eV.18 The relative percentages of these carbon atoms
before and after plasma treatment are listed in Table 1. The concentration of C–C bonds in
pristine CNTs is greater than that in treated CNTs, while in turn
the treated CNTs have higher percentages of oxygen-containing functional
groups after exposure to plasma. This implies that the treated CNTs
may have more defects, which can act as nucleation sites for the growth
of Pt NPs.

The morphology of CNTs before and after oxygen plasma
treatment
was investigated by FESEM. As can be seen from Figure 3a, the as-grown NTs represent curly and twisted
structures with some agglomerations. The length of NTs was determined
to be ∼10–12 μm in Figure 3a. According to our previous work, the grown
NTs are attributed to the multiwall nanostructures.14 As for the sample subjected to oxygen plasma treatment,
its morphology remained the same as that of pristine sample (Figure 3c,d). Figure 3e–g represent CNT samples
decorated with Pt NPs fabricated by ALD with 25, 50, and 100 cycles,
respectively. Low magnification SEM images revealed that the morphology
of CNTs was not influenced much by the ALD process even though it
was performed at a significantly high temperature (∼280 °C).
Pt NPs deposited with 25 cycles are randomly spread on the surface
of CNTs with an irregular size (inset in Figure 3e). Yet, when the Pt NPs were deposited with
50 cycles, their density and distribution improved significantly (insets
in Figure 3f). After
deposition for 100 cycles (Figure 3g), the particle density reached maximum, which resulted
in their apparent transformation into thin films (inset in Figure 3g). The compositional
analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) (Table 2) confirms the deposition of
Pt NPs on the surface of CNTs and its increased loading with a higher
cycle number of ALD.

In order
to precisely determine the size of Pt NPs, TEM and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images of CNTs covered with 25, 50, and 100 cycles of
Pt ALD were performed. As can be seen from Figure 4a, CNTs@Pt25 demonstrated the nonuniform
distribution of Pt NPs which size distribution was evaluated statistically
to be ∼2.08 ± 1.34 nm (Figure 4b). It is seen that a certain portion of
particles with sizes over 4–5 nm can be clearly visible in
the TEM image (Figure 4a), and their contribution into the overall platinum mass lies in
NPs is considered to be sufficient. Such a wide size distribution
of Pt NPs deposited with a low cycle number (∼25 cycles) was
reported previously and the following explanation was provided.19,20 There existed two growth regimes for Pt ALD, one at low temperatures
(i.e., T ≤ 100 °C) and one at high temperatures
(i.e., T ≥ 150 °C). The high temperature
regime is characterized by the formation of large NPs aside of small
ones and very broad distribution of the interparticle distances. It
was noticed, for example, that “10 cycles of conventional thermal
Pt ALD...carried out at 250 °C gave rise...to numerous populations
of small NPs of about 1 nm coexisting next to NPs as large as 24 nm”.20 The origin of large Pt NPs could be attributed
to the Ostwald ripening,21 that is, to
minimize the surface energy, the growth of larger NPs occurrs at the
expense of smaller ones via exchange of single atoms. Such phenomena
become possible due to the formation of the PtOx species at the surface of a Pt cluster, which lowers the barrier
for Pt atom detachment and enables Ostwald ripening at relatively
low temperatures. In addition, PtOx species
(PtO or PtO2) formed in an oxidizing atmosphere might diffuse
with higher rates in comparison to metallic Pt atoms.21 Sufficient presence of the PtO compound in Pt NPs deposited
with 25 cycles is demonstrated below. As an alternative, it was also
reported that the presence of large Pt NPs could also be explained
by NPs diffusion and coalescence due to the different magnitudes of
the local temperature and pressure fluctuations during the deposition
process.19,20

Figure 4 TEM and HRTEM images of CNTs@Pt25 (a,c), CNTs@Pt50
(d,f), and CNTs@Pt100
(g,i) nanocomposites. Figures (b,e,h) show corresponding histograms
of the particles size distribution.

For the HRTEM measurement, the particle with sizes over 5 nm was
chosen for analysis as it allows to more precisely determine its lattice
spacing. The image shown in Figure 4c reveals that Pt NPs deposited with 25 cycles have
a lattice spacing of 0.22 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of
face centered cubic Pt, which is in good agreement with the XRD pattern
(will be shown below).12 It is also noted
that the intershell distance of CNTs clearly seen in Figure 4c is 0.35 nm and it satisfies
the values represented in literature.22 In turn, the sample, prepared with 50 cycles of Pt ALD shows a denser
distribution of Pt NPs with very regular size (Figure 4d) which could be estimated as ∼2.96
± 0.48 nm (Figure 4e). The lattice spacing of Pt NPs after 50 cycles (0.22 nm) was determined
to be identical to that of Pt deposited with 25 cycles (Figure 4f). Finally, the sample prepared
with 100 cycles of Pt ALD demonstrates a very high presence of NPs,
which are often overlapped with each other (Figure 4g). The particle size was statistically determined
to be ∼5.16 ± 0.82 nm (Figure 4h), it is clearly seen that the size of NPs
increases sufficiently as well as their density. The lattice spacing
revealed by the HRTEM analysis (Figure 4i) is determined to be 0.22 nm, similar to that prepared
with 25 and 50 cycles of ALD.

XRD analysis (Figure 5) was utilized to investigate
the crystal structure of the samples.
The XRD pattern taken from the uncoated CNTs reveals a peak at around
27° which is corresponding to hexagonal carbon (002).23 In addition, several peaks ascribed to Fe3O4 are also could be observed. Their appearance
is explained by the decomposition of iron nitrate NPs during the growth
of CNTs as the temperature inside the MPCVD chamber reached over 400
°C.24

Figure 5 (a) XRD patterns of CNTs before and after
decoration with Pt NPs.
(b,c) represents enlarged and deconvoluted XRD patterns in the selected
range of the pristine CNTs and CNTs@Pt25 samples, respectively.

After the deposition of Pt NPs by ALD, the samples
deposited with
50 and 100 cycles of ALD revealed clear appearance of peaks at ∼39.7°
and ∼46.3°, which belong to (111) and (200) orientations,
respectively, and it is in agreement with that reported by Aaltonen
et al.25 For the sample deposited with
25 cycles of ALD, the observation of peaks ascribed to Pt NPs become
possible only after the deconvolution of the XRD pattern and its consequent
comparison with pristine CNTs (Figure 4 c). Overall, the gradually increased intensity of
Pt peaks follows the ALD cycle number, which is explained by higher
loading and improved crystallinity of NPs. As a final remark, it is
important to mention that the samples covered with Pt NPs demonstrate
the lower intensity of the graphite peak (002) which gradually declines
following the cycle number of ALD as the coverage of the CNT surface
with Pt NP increases.

XPS was performed to further analyze the
composition of Pt NPs
and to probe the effect of the Pt NP size on the electronic properties
of CNTs@Pt nanocomposites. Figure 6 shows the high-resolution Pt 4f spectra of the CNTs@Pt
nanocomposites which exhibit doublets from the spin–orbit splitting
of the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states and intensities
of them are increased with the increased cycle number of ALD. In addition,
they can be deconvoluted into two peaks, indicating that all Pt NPs
consist of metallic Pt and PtO. The presence of PtO can be explained
by the ALD reaction, where the oxygen precursor is involved in the
formation of Pt.26 Moreover, it is also
highly possible that the very small size of Pt NPs is susceptible
to oxidation by the ambient environment. After careful evaluation
of the relative integrated area percentages of the peaks referred
to Pt and PtO, it is seen that the content of PtO decreases with the
increased cycle number of ALD (Table 3). It was reported that at a low cycle number, the
“initial formation of PtO”27 might occur, the presence of which becomes less evident with increased
cycle number of ALD. It is in accordance with our observation. Finally,
given that the penetration depth of XPS is around 10 nm,11 it allows to precisely calculating the atomic
ratio of Pt on the surface of CNTs. The following values of 0.9, 14.2,
and 44.3% are determined for CNTs@Pt25, CNTs@Pt50, and CNTs@Pt100,
respectively. As can be seen, with the increased cycle number of ALD,
the loading of Pt sufficiently increases which is in agreement with
XRD and EDX results.

In order
to determine the electrical properties of CNTs before
and after decoration with Pt NPs by ALD, conductive atomic force microscopy
was applied. As can be seen from Figure 7, the pristine CNTs show the maximum current
amplitude at about 1.2 nA. On the other hand, after Pt NPs were deposited
with 25, 50, and 100 cycles of ALD, the current amplitude increased
to 246.4, 534.7, and 884.7 nA, respectively. Thus, the surface electrical
conductivity of the CNTs@Pt nanocomposite is highly increased after
the deposition of Pt NPs and the rise of conductivity follows the
cycle number of ALD. It could be explained as follows. According to
the XPS analysis, the content of PtO in Pt NPs decreases with a higher
cycle number of ALD while the presence of metallic, that is, Pt compound
increases and become gradually dominated. The conductivity of Pt is
obviously higher than that of PtO, thus, decreasing the PtO content
would certainly resulted in increased conductivity of Pt NPs.

Figure 7 Two-dimensional
maps of peak currents measured by PF-TUNA on (a)
pristine CNTs, (b) CNTs@Pt25, (c) CNTs@Pt50, and (d) CNTs@Pt100 nanocomposites.

FE properties of the samples before and after the
ALD deposition
of Pt NPs  were measured. The cathode was consisted
of uncoated CNTs or CNTs@Pt (emitters) grown on Si wafer (substrate)
while the anode represented tungsten. The pristine CNTs were chosen
as a standard to compare. It is necessary to notice that plasma treatment
for ∼5 s has almost no impact on its FE characteristics (Figure S3). Figure 8a shows current densities at different electric
fields of the CNTs with and without the decoration of Pt NPs. The
turn-on field for the pristine CNTs, CNTs@Pt25, CNTs@Pt50, and CNTs@Pt100
were calculated to be ∼1.20, ∼0.69, ∼0.57, and
∼0.43 V/μm, respectively. As can be seen, the higher
cycle number of ALD causes CNTs to display a lower turn-on field.
To further understand the FE characteristic, the J–E data were analyzed using the classical F–N theory, Figure 8b. The linear curve of the high field segments
of the F–N plot indicates
the electron emission from the tunnel effect, and the slope of the
curve is related to the FE enhancement factor (β). In the F–N theory, β can be calculated
using the following equation14  where B = −6.83 ×
103 eV–3/2 V/μm–1, m is the slope of high field segments of F–N plot and ψ is the work
function of the emitter material with the assumption of 4.5 eV.14 The enhancement factor β for the pristine
CNTs, CNTs@Pt25, CNTs@Pt50, and CNTs@Pt100 were calculated to be 3571,
6715, 7537, and 17340, respectively.

Figure 8 (a) J–E curves and (b)
the corresponding F–N plots
for the CNTs before and after decoration with Pt NPs.

Thus, it is obvious that the deposition of Pt NPs positively
influences
on FE characteristics of CNTs. The higher the cycle number of ALD,
the more evident the presence of Pt NPs as their distribution and
concentration increased significantly, the higher the conductivity
of CNTs@Pt nanocomposites due to the lower presence of the PtO compound,
the better FE characteristics. In future, it is possible to extend
further the efficiency of the CNTs@Pt composite through more precise
and accurate tuning of ALD deposition parameters.

Conclusions
In this work, a simple approach was used to decorate CNTs with
Pt NPs by ALD. With different cycle numbers of ALD it was possible
to precisely adjust the size and distribution of NPs. The nanocomposite
CNTs@Pt showed highly enhanced filed emission characteristics compared
with that of pristine CNTs. It was discovered that the higher number
of ALD cycles, the greater decrement of turn-on field, which
reaches a minimum value of ∼0.43 V/μm after 100 cycles
of ALD. The increased performance with increased cycle number of Pt
ALD was mostly attributed to the gradually decreased presence of the
PtO compound in Pt NPs which resulted in highly enhanced conductivity
of the nanocomposite and increased loading.
