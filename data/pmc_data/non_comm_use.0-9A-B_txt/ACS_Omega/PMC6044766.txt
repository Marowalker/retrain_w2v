A carboxyphenyl-substituted
corrole, 5,15-dimesityl-10-(4′-carboxyphenyl)corrole
(1), has been synthesized and characterized by UV–vis,
fluorescence, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization
(ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. An air-stable corrole radical
(1•) was obtained with the addition
of the Fe(III) salt to 1 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and characterized by UV–vis, fluorescence, electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR), ESI-MS techniques, and density functional theory
studies. The neutral corrole radical (1•) exhibited a sharp EPR signal at g = 2.006 in DMSO.
The reduced bipyrrolic (N–C–C–N) dihedral angle
(χ) of 1 from 19.11 to 7.07° leads to the
release of angle strain, which is the driving force for the generation
of 1•. Notably, trans-dimesityl groups prevent the dimerization or aggregation of the
corrole radical. Further, 1• was converted
to 1 by excess addition of Fe(II) salts in DMSO at 298
K.

Introduction
In recent years, studies
on tetrapyrrolic macrocycles have been
given ardent interest to explore their structural, photophysical,
and photochemical properties. Corrole is a structural counterpart
of porphyrin, and it emanates from the corrin ring. Recently, corroles
have emerged as an independent area of research1−4 due to their useful applications
in catalysis, sensors, molecular electronics, solar cells, nonlinear
optics, and photodynamic therapy.5,6 A number of
free base corroles and their metal complexes have been synthesized
and characterized over the last two decades after the invention of
facile synthetic methods. Notably, β-functionalization such
as halogenation, nitration, chlorosulfonation, and hydroformylation
of the corrole periphery leads to the formation of novel and more
sophisticated corroles.7 Different strategies
are available to prepare symmetrical and unsymmetrical corroles in
good yields.8

Redox chemistry of electron-rich corroles is of great interest
due to the formation of radical and cationic/anionic corrole species.
Recently, Kadish et al. have generalized the redox mechanism of meso-substituted
free base corroles using cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical
studies.9a

For example, the oxidation
of free base trimesitylcorrole (Cor)H3 yielded [(Cor)H3]•+, which is
a strong acid and rapidly transforms into (•Cor)H2 and H+. Further, H+ reacts with another
free base corrole and produces [(Cor)H4]+ ions.
The electroreduction of (•Cor)H2 gives
(Cor)H2–. The mixing of (Cor)H4+ and (Cor)H2– produces a
neutral corrole, (Cor)H3, by an acid–base proton-transfer
mechanism, as shown in the above scheme. Recently, the 3,17-dichloro-meso-trimesitylcorrole radical was reported by Bröring
et al., which was further used to prepare the first-ever Zn(II) corrole
radical.9b The mesityl groups prevent the
aggregation or dimerization of radical species and stabilize the radical
corrole in its monomeric form. On the other hand, Anand et al. have
synthesized a stable and neutral 25π-pentathiophene radical
species, which readily converts into aromatic and antiaromatic electronic
circuits on adding appropriate chemical agents.9c Kobayashi et al. have reported an extremely air-stable
19π-electron azaporphyrin radical, which was prepared from the
reduction of a cationic P(V) azaporphyrin.9d The central phosphorus(V) atom and the peripheral bulky tert-butyl groups stabilize the reduced state.

Herein,
we report the generation of stable corrole radical species
(1•) of 5,15-dimesityl-10-(4′-carboxyphenyl)corrole
(1) as well as 5,15-dimesityl-10-(4′-methoxycarbonylphenyl)corrole
(MEC) by a chemical oxidation process in quantitative yield using
FeIII salts in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 298 K. The
corrole radical was characterized by UV–vis, fluorescence,
electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS), electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory
(DFT) studies. Notably, 1 was regenerated by the excess
addition of FeII salt to 1• in DMSO at 298 K.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
The synthesis of 1 was carried out in two steps; the
first step involves the
synthesis of MEC by acid (HCl)-catalyzed condensation of 5-mesityldipyrromethane
and methyl 4-formylbenzoate in an H2O/MeOH (1:2, v/v) mixture,8a followed by alkaline hydrolysis of MEC in 95%
ethanol to afford 1 (45% yield) in the second step. The
synthesized free base corrole, 1, was characterized by
UV–vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic techniques and MS (Scheme 1).8b

Scheme 1 Synthetic
Route for 5,15-Dimesityl-10-(4′-carboxyphenyl)corrole
(1)
The free base corrole (1) exhibited a Soret
band at
410 nm with a shoulder at 417 nm and three Q bands in the visible
region located at 567, 602, and 638 nm in CH2Cl2 as shown in Figure S1.8bFigure S2 represents the 1H NMR spectra of MEC in CDCl3. Figures S3 and S4 illustrate the 1H NMR spectra
of 1 in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6, respectively. The ESI mass spectrum of 1 in
CH3CN is shown in Figure S5.
To probe the influence of the carboxyphenyl group at the meso-position
of the corrole ring, we carried out the cyclic voltammetric studies
of 1 using a saturated calomel electrode as the reference
electrode in CH2Cl2 at 298 K. 1 exhibited one-electron reversible oxidation and reduction as illustrated
in Figure S6. The first oxidation potential
of 1 was observed at 0.73 V, while the reduction potential
was observed at −0.78 V at 298 K.

Spectroscopic Studies
We used electronic absorption
spectral studies to demonstrate the formation of 1•, which is produced from the A2B corrole
(1) with the addition of 1 equiv of Fe(III) salt in DMSO
at 298 K, as shown in Figure 1. Further, we have tested with MEC and 5,10,15-tritolylcorrole
(TTC) by the addition of 1 equiv of Fe(III) salt in DMSO at 298 K.
The spectral changes of MEC are comparable to those of 1 while adding Fe(III) salt with a prominent peak at 390 nm (Figure S8a), indicating the formation of a radical
corrole, which is further confirmed by electron spin resonance studies
(vide infra). However, TTC exhibited only marginal spectral changes,
with a shoulder at 390 nm (Figure S8b),
indicating the partial formation of a radical corrole. Herein, we
have a brief discussion about the interaction of corrole 1 with FeIII ions in DMSO at 298 K. The observed UV–vis
spectral pattern of 1• matches with that of the reported corrole radical by Kadish et al.9a and Bröring et al.,9b whereas no changes were observed with other metal ions
(Figure S7). The appropriate redox reagents
such as a one-electron oxidizing agent [Et3O+SbCl6–] and a one-electron reducing
agent (KO2) were used to confirm the radical nature of 1. The addition of [Et3O+SbCl6–] to 1 in DMSO leads to the similar
color and UV–vis spectral changes as FeIII (Figure S9a). The anionic species of corrole 1 was obtained with the successive addition of FeIII and KO2 (one-electron reducing agent) in DMSO, as shown
in Figure S9b. We have also tested the
protonation version of 1 with TFA in DMSO, as shown in Figure S10. In general, protonated corroles,
[CorH4]+, show a characteristic intense band
between 632 and 694 nm. The lack of spectral signatures of the protonated
corrole after addition of the Fe(III) salt indicates that the protonated
corrole is not formed during the chemical oxidation. The spectral
features of 1• are similar
to those of the pentathiophene radical reported by Anand et al.9c Hence, the conversion of 1 to the
neutral corrole radical (1•) may follow a radical mechanism (homolytic cleavage of N–H)
as reported by Bröring et al.9b

Figure 1 UV–vis
spectral titration of 1 (18 μM)
with FeIII (1.6–20 μM) in DMSO at 298 K.

The driving force for the forward
reaction in Scheme 2 is possibly due to the redox
reaction between the electronically rich corrole (1)
(having two mesityl groups) and the FeIII ion, which behaves
as an oxidizing agent. The formed radical species is stabilized in
the presence of electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid and carbomethoxy
groups (-R effect) and a high polarity of DMSO. The ESI mass spectrum
of 1• was found to be 1 mass unit less
than the exact mass of 1, which confirms the formation
of radical species (Figure S11). The simulated
isotopic pattern of the corrole radical is matching with the experimentally
observed one (Figure S11).

Scheme 2 Schematic
Representation of the Formation of 1• in the Presence of FeIII or [Et3O+SbCl6–] and Its
Reversibility While Adding Excess of FeII in DMSO
The UV–vis spectrum
of 1 exhibited a Soret
band at 414 nm with a shoulder at 431 nm and Q bands at 574, 604,
and 638 nm. The UV–vis spectral titration of 1 with Fe(III) perchlorate is depicted in Figure 1. An incremental addition of FeIII ions into the solution of 1 leads to a concomitant
increase in the absorbance at 394 nm with a decrease in absorbance
of Soret (414, 431sh) and Q bands (574, 604, and 638 nm) accompanied
by a color change from purple to pale brown.

Two isosbestic
points were observed at 404 and 516 nm upon addition
of FeIII ions into corrole 1, as shown in Figure 1. Fluorescence quenching
was observed at 658 nm (excitation at 574 nm) while addition of FeIII ions to 1, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Fluorescence spectral titration of 1 (18 μM)
with FeIII (1.6–20 μM) in DMSO at 298 K.

The fluorescence of 1 is completely quenched with
1 equiv of Fe(III) salt in DMSO at 298 K. The 1:1 stoichiometry of 1 with FeIII was calculated by a Job plot, as shown
in Figure S12. The addition of excess FeCl2 or Fe(ClO4)2 to 1• in DMSO leads to a reverse absorption
profile and also a color change from pale brown to purple due to one-electron
reduction, which shows reversible redox behavior of 1, as depicted in Scheme 2 and Figures 3 and S13.

of 1 while
adding FeCl3 and excess of FeCl2 in DMSO at
298 K.

EPR Spectral Studies of
the Corrole Radical (1•)
The formation of the corrole
radical (1•) was characterized
by EPR spectroscopy. We have carried out EPR experiments using the
X-band EPR spectrometer in DMSO at 298 K as well as at lower temperatures.

The EPR spectrum of 1 (1.5 mmol) in the presence of
FeIII at different temperatures showed a sharp signal at g = 2.006 (∼ organic radical species), which corresponds
to 1•, as depicted in Figures 4a and S14b. Similar results were obtained in the solid-state
EPR spectrum of 1 + FeIII at 100 K, as shown
in Figure 4b. The EPR
spectrum of Fe(ClO4)3 in the solid state at
100 K (Figure S15) is quite different from
that of 1•. These results
clearly indicate the existence of a paramagnetic species, 1•. Similar EPR spectral changes were
observed with the addition of FeIII to MEC at variable
temperatures under similar experimental conditions (Figure S16).

Logic Gate Application
The convenient
use of logic
gates fascinated the attention of researchers in the construction
of molecular switches and molecular keypad devices. Figure 5 shows the truth table and
the logic gate operation using UV–vis spectral changes of 1 at a Q-band of 574 nm (a peak at 574 nm: output = 1 and
absence of a peak at 574 nm: output = 0) in the presence or absence
of FeIII and FeII. We have used four input combinations:
(0, 0) (0, 1) (1, 0), and (1, 1). An output signal was observed
at the Q-band at 574 nm in the presence or absence of FeIII and FeII (input FeIII and FeII =
0 or 1). The absorbance at 574 nm was diminished (output = 0) in the
presence of FeIII (input FeIII = 1 and FeII = 0), whereas its intensity was regained in the presence
of excess Fe(II) salt in DMSO at 298 K.

table based on UV–vis spectral
changes of 1 in the presence of FeIII and
FeII ions in DMSO.

DFT Calculations
We optimized the geometry of 1 and 1• using
B3LYP functional and the 6-31G basis set in the gas phase. The bond
angle (red) and bond lengths (black) in the optimized structure of 1 and 1• are shown
in Figure 6. One pyrrole
ring of 1 is deviated from the 23-atom core, whereas
the same attains planarity in the case of 1• with the removal of one proton from the corrole
core. In addition, the bipyrrolic (N–C–C–N) dihedral
angle (χ) in 1 was found to be 19.11°, which
is reduced to 7.07° in 1•. The reduced N–C–C–N dihedral angle (χ)
leads to the release of strain present in the smaller corrole core
due to the presence of three NH. The decrement in χ is the driving
force for the generation of corrole radical 1•.

Figure 6 Optimized geometries of 1 and 1• using B3LYP functional and
the 6-31G basis
set in the gas phase. The bond angles and bond lengths are represented
in red and black colors, respectively.

Further, time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations were performed
to
examine the absorption properties of 1•. The simulated electronic absorption spectral features using
TD-DFT studies matched with the experimentally observed absorption
profile (Figure S17).

Conclusions
We have synthesized a carboxyphenyl-substituted corrole (1) and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. 1 leads to a stable neutral radical species, 1•, in the presence of FeIII in DMSO as well as in the solid state. The observed UV–vis
spectral features of 1• are in accordance with the reported literature. Further, complete
fluorescence quenching of 1 was observed with 1 equiv
of FeIII, and 1:1 stoichiometry was confirmed by the Job
plot. The formation of radical species was supported by fluorescence
quenching, decrement in lifetime, ESI-MS, and by using appropriate
one-electron redox reagents. Further, 1• was reconverted to its precursor 1 by the addition
of excess Fe(II) salt and to the corresponding protonated corrole,
[(Cor)H4]+, by the addition of a trace of TFA
in DMSO. 1• shows a sharp
EPR signal at g = 2.006 in the presence of Fe(III)
in DMSO as well as in the solid state. The angle strain in 1• reduced, and DFT studies suggest
that the reduced bipyrrolic (N–C–C–N) dihedral
angle (χ) of 1 from 19.11 to 7.07° in 1• is the driving force for
the generation of the neutral corrole radical. The simulated absorption
spectral features using TD-DFT calculations match with the experimental
one. Overall, the spectroscopic and theoretical studies suggest the
formation of 1• while
adding Fe(III) salt to 1 in DMSO.
