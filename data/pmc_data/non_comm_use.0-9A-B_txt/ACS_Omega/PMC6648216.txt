The cytotoxic potential of allicin
was evaluated on different cancer
cell lines, particularly, hepatic (HepG-2), breast (MCF-7), lung (A-549),
and prostatic (PC-3), where allicin scored an IC50 score
of 19.26 μM on HepG-2. In order to increase the cell uptake,
optimized allicin-loaded gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) were prepared
where the optimum formulation was surface-conjugated to glycyrrhetinic
acid. GNPs were optimized using a D-optimal design. The optimum formulation
had a particle size of 370.7 ± 6.78 nm and polydispersity index
of 0.0363 ± 0.009 and 39.13 ± 2.38% of drug entrapment.
The conjugation of the ligand, glycyrrhetinic acid with allicin-loaded
GNPs, was confirmed utilizing 1H NMR. Drug release profiles
in the presence/absence of collagenase were obtained. Finally, a cytotoxicity
study on HepG-2 was performed for the unconjugated and conjugated
allicin-loaded GNPs scoring IC50 of 10.95 and 5.046 μM,
revealing two- and fourfold enhancements in allicin cytotoxicity,
respectively. To our knowledge, the ligand–carrier pair, glycyrrhetinic
acid–gelatin, was not explored before, and the developed system
poses a successful liver cancer therapy.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Applying
the combined approach of passive targeting and ligand
surface-decorated drug delivery systems in cancer treatment has the
advantage that these delivery systems have the ability for more internalization
at the specific cancerous cell sites. In return, this will lead to
more enhanced therapies with less side and adverse effects.1 Through modification of the polyfunctional surface
of gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) by conjugation with a targeting ligand,
this approach could be tackled. Glycyrrhetinic acid, the aglycon released
from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin extracted from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) roots, is believed to possess
a highly specific binding site in rat liver2 and is a potential ligand to the asialoglyco protein receptors (ASGPRs)
abundant in the liver. Additionally, glycyrrhetinic acid itself has
antihepatitis and hepatoprotective activities.3 Gelatin is a denatured protein obtained by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis
of collagen which is plentifully found in many animal tissues. Regarding
nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, gelatin, unlike synthetic polymers,
is considered to have a good safety profile. In addition of being
GRAS by the FDA, gelatin shows low antigenicity because of being a
denatured protein.4 The accessibility of
its functional groups helps for many chemical modifications, of which
developing a targeted nanovehicle is of great importance.5

In many research studies, allicin showed
promising anticancer and
anti-metastatic activity through various mechanisms.6 It has the ability to inhibit lymph angiogenesis which
is a key cellular process in metastasis of tumor cells. In addition,
it was found to suppress capillary formation, cell migration, and
phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.7 Also, the antioxidant property of allicin, by
prompting the cellular phase II detoxification system, contributes
to its anticancer activity.8 Other mechanisms
including inhibition of cell proliferation due to its microtubule-disrupting
properties9 and induction of apoptosis
and cell-cycle arrest10 were also investigated.

Therefore, the aim of this work is to formulate optimized allicin-loaded
GNPs. Conjugation of the optimized drug-loaded GNPs with glycyrrhetinic
acid was also investigated aiming at achieving safe and effective
delivery of the drug allicin to hepatic cancer cells via intratumor
injection. Additionally, the ligand–receptor interaction was
assessed using molecular docking.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Cytotoxicity Screening
of Allicin on Different
Human Cancer Cell Lines
Allicin, as a drug of choice, was
evaluated regarding its cytotoxicity using MTT assay that relies on
the mitochondrial activity of the active viable cells. The cytotoxic
potential of allicin on different human cancer cell lines, namely,
human hepatocellular cancer cell line HepG-2, human breast cancer
cell line MCF-7, human lung cancer cell line A-549, and human prostatic
cancer cell line PC-3 is shown in Figure 1, where allicin scored IC50 of
19.26, 28.51, 36, and 77.92 μM, respectively. It is observed
that allicin exerts its most inhibitory effect on hepatic cancer cells,
making it a promising natural substance that could be used in the
treatment of liver cancer cases.

Figure 1 Evaluation of the cytotoxic potential of allicin on: (A) human hepatocellular
cancer cell line HepG-2, (B) human breast cancer cell line MCF-7,
(C) human lung cancer cell line, and (D) human prostatic cancer cell
line.

Accordingly, the HepG-2 cell lines
were selected for further investigations
in this work. In order to enhance the allicin cytotoxic effect, it
was loaded in GNPs as nanocarriers, afterward the allicin-loaded GNPs
were conjugated with glycyrrhetinic acid to promote the active hepatocellular
uptake. As will be shown later, both conjugated and unconjugated allicin-loaded
GNPs were investigated on HEPG-2 cell line to evaluate the effect
of nanonization11 and conjugation on IC50 of allicin.

2.2 Practical Yield of Plain
GNPs
The
percentage yield of the plain GNPs relative to the initial amount
of gelatin used was 16.16 ± 0.3%. On the other hand, the percentage
yield relative to the obtained gel-like precipitate [representing
the actual mass of high molecular weight (HMW) gelatin, i.e., capable
of forming the nanoparticles] after the first desolvation step was
found to be 23.488 ± 0.44%. This data goes with accordance to
that explained by Zwiorek.5

2.3 Particle Size and PDI Measurements of the
Plain GNPs
Both particle size and polydispersity index (PDI)
are key determinants in the implication of nanotechnology in the development
of drug delivery systems as they directly affect the biodistribution,
destiny, targeting properties, and toxicity of such nanodelivery systems.12

The results displayed in Table 1 indicate that increasing gluteraldehyde
(GA) % leads generally to a decrease in particle size. Concerning
the cross-linking time, the opposite was observed. This finding can
be indicated by giving enough time for interparticular amide bridging
between different GNPs because of the symmetric cross-linking effect
of GA leading to particle growth as a result of GNP aggregation.13 On the other hand, the effect of stirring speed
on the resultant particle size stays unclear, so, further data analysis
was employed to explore its effect. Consequently, the optimum formulation
(run #12) in terms of particle size (370.7 ± 6.78) and PDI (0.0363
± 0.009), which was selected for completing the rest of the study
experiments, was prepared at the highest experimented gelatin[NH2]/GA[CHO] ratio of 1:2 (i.e., 66.67%)
and the lowest of the cross-linking time (4 h). Despite the high GA
% used, the particle size produced was the smallest among the whole
design. This could be attributed to the fact that high GA % would
provide enough amount of cross-linking to achieve sufficient intraparticular
amide bonding within the GNPs in order to be satisfactorily hardened
and shrunken but the short cross-linking time avoids chances of formation
of interparticular bridging and particle aggregation.14

Regarding the PDIs, it ranged from
0.0363 ± 0.009 to 0.535
± 0.069. It is noticeable that PDIs are relatively low, indicating
narrow particle size distribution. This could prove the efficiency
of the double desolvation method in producing uniform particle size
owing to the process of discarding the low and intermediate molecular
weight gelatin which is not involved in the formation of nanoparticles
in the first desolvation step as discussed in the previous section.15 The data statistical analyses, 3D and contour
plots, and the generated model diagnostics and validation are found
in the Supporting Information, Table S1
and Figures S1–S4.

2.4 Allicin-Loaded GNPs
2.4.1 Entrapment Efficiency of Allicin-Loaded
GNPs
Allicin was entrapped in the optimized gelatin nanospheres
with an average entrapment efficiency of 39.13 ± 2.38%. This
moderate efficiency could be attributed to the hydrophilic nature
of allicin that may lead to its easy leakage in the aqueous environment
during or after the preparation of the nanoparticles.16,17

2.4.2 Particle Size and PDI Measurement
The results of allicin-loaded optimized formulation were insignificantly
different at P < 0.05 compared to its plain counterpart
where the results of particle size and PDI measurements were 371.9
± 5.54 and 0.0313 ± 0.007, respectively. This indicates
the efficient and homogeneous incorporation of allicin throughout
the matrix of the produced nanospheres being both hydrophilic in nature.

2.4.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) morphological examination
for the prepared allicin-loaded GNPs revealed that particles were
spherical and homogeneous with the absence of any aggregates (Figure 2). Moreover, the
indicated particle size for the GNPs showed a good correlation with
particle size measurements obtained by the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) method except that the latter method provided slightly larger
particle size as DLS measures the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles
and on an intensity-based manner so that the latter method is relatively
sensitive to the formation of aggregates and is biased toward the
larger particles.15

allicin-loaded GNPs at a magnification

2.5 Confirming
Glycyrrhetinic Acid Conjugation
Using 1H NMR Spectroscopy
Glycyrrhetinic acid
showed the carboxylic OH peak at 11 ppm (the most deshielded), the
peak of the allylic double bond in the cyclohexene at 5.4 ppm, and
the aliphatic region at 0.5–2.5 ppm as illustrated in the Supporting Information, Figure S5A. Referring
to the Supporting Information, Figure S5B,
it displayed the unconjugated allicin-loaded GNPs. The chemical conjugation
of glycyrrhetinic acid to allicin-loaded GNPs was confirmed by the Supporting Information, Figure S5C where the
disappearance of the peak for the carboxylic OH proton of glycyrrhetinic
acid (11 ppm) proved the formation of the amide bond between the carboxylic
OH of glycyrrhetinic acid and the amino groups of gelatin. Also, the
presence of the allylic double bond peak in the cyclohexene (5.4 ppm)
and the aliphatic region (0.5–2.5 ppm) emphasizes this conjugation
as clearly depicted in the Supporting Information, Figure S5D.

2.6 In Vitro Release Study
of Allicin-Loaded GNPs
Enzymatic degradation of GNPs within
the body can occur inside
the cell after internalization of the particles or outside the cell
by other extracellular proteases at neutral or acidic pH.18

After 24 h incubation in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 in the presence of collagenase, GNPs showed
a cumulative percent released for allicin of 96.04 ± 2.2%, whereas
after the same time interval in the absence of collagenase, GNPs appeared
to be more stable with only 46.61 ± 3.55% of cumulative allicin
percent released. Thus, in the presence of collagenase, almost all
of the allicin were resolved after 24 h. Both release profiles are
biphasic with similar release behavior, exhibiting a relatively rapid
release within the first 8 h, then a more sustained release pattern
evidenced until the end of the experiment (24 h). This behavior can
be explained by the distribution of allicin within the GNPs. Being
a denaturated protein, gelatin is built up of amino acid backbone.
Accordingly, proteolytic enzymes are expected to play a pivotal role
in the release of the entrapped drugs from the gelatin matrix when
used as a drug delivery system.19 This
enzymatic degradation of GNPs within the body can occur inside the
cell after internalization of the particles or outside the cell by
other extracellular proteases at neutral or acidic pH.18 Allicin release from the prepared optimized
GNPs was believed to be governed by three concomitant mechanisms,
namely, the release of the surface-electrically bound allicin, the
diffusion of allicin from the GNP matrix to the release medium, and
the erosion of the gelatin matrix due to dissolution in the aqueous
release medium or/and digestion via proteolysis.20 Considering these overlapping mechanisms, allicin in vitro
release was evaluated in both the presence and absence of collagenase
enzyme.

It is obvious that both release profiles (Figure 3) are biphasic with the same
release behavior,
exhibiting a relatively rapid release within the first 8 h followed
by a more retarded release pattern evidenced until the end of the
experiment (24 h). This behavior can be explained by the dual distribution
of allicin within the GNPs, adsorbed electrostatically to the surface
and entrapped throughout the gelatin matrix. In the presence of collagenase
enzyme, release occurred owing to combined mechanisms of drug diffusion
and matrix erosion because of both dissolution of gelatin in the aqueous
medium and proteolytic activity of collagenase.

Figure 3 In vitro release profiles
of allicin from the prepared GNPs in
PBS of pH 7.4 with and without collagenase.

During the first 2 h, ∼20% of allicin was released
because
of the fast liberation of the surface-bound allicin together with
the digestion of the gelatin matrix. PBS of pH 7.4 serves as an alkaline
medium for the GNPs (IEP of ∼5.7); hence, the surface positive charge decreases because of the suppressed
protonation of the amino groups and facilitates the release of the
surface-bound negatively charged allicin.21

Subsequently, from 2 to 4 h, the rate of release was decreased
as it was limited by the slow diffusion of allicin from the cross-linked
gelatin matrix in addition to the digestion of this matrix. Moreover,
the deterioration of the matrix by the action of collagenase enzyme
substantially increased the rate of allicin release during the period
from 4 to 8 h. Therefore, the release of ≈80% was achieved
during the first 8 h. Afterward, the inner collapsed core of the gelatin
matrix retarded the release of the remaining allicin in a sustained
slow manner.

In the case of absence of collagenase, the same
behavior was evidenced
except for the lack of the proteolytic effect on digesting the gelatin
matrix. Initially, a rapid release of only ≈40% was evidenced
during the first 8 h. However, nearly another 5% was released for
the end of 24 h where the release of allicin depended only on its
diffusion and the slow dissolution of the cross-linked gelatin matrix.

Accordingly, after 24 h incubation in PBS of pH 7.4 in the presence
of collagenase, GNPs showed a cumulative percent release for allicin
of 97.71 ± 2.02%, whereas after the same time interval in the
absence of collagenase, only 51.74 ± 1.27% of cumulative allicin
percent was released.

In vivo, being in the systemic circulation,
GNPs were reported
to distribute rapidly into the liver and the spleen and phagocytozed
by liver Kupffer cells.22 Synergistically,
in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, GNPs would passively accumulate
in the hepatic tissue by the enhanced permeability and retention effect.23,24 Following endocytosis of A-GNPs, allicin release would be augmented
via the intracellular lysozymes and the hyperenzyme activity of the
over expressed matrix metalloproteases inside hepatic cancer cells.25,26

2.7 Cytotoxicity of the Conjugated and Unconjugated
Allicin-Loaded GNPs on HEPG-2 Cells
MTT assay was employed
to measure the viability of HepG-2 hepatocellular cancer cells after
24 h incubation of different concentrations of both unconjugated and
conjugated allicin-loaded GNPs. Both showed significantly enhanced
cytotoxic effect where the IC50 of the unconjugated particles
was 10.95 μM, whereas that of the conjugated particles was 5.046
μM. Compared to native allicin (IC50 of 19.29 μM),
the cytotoxic potential was improved by approximately twofold for
the unconjugated allicin-loaded GNPs and by fourfold for the conjugated
allicin-loaded GNPs (Figure 4). This improvement can be ascribed to the encouraged passive
endocytosis occurred because of the formulation of allicin in a nanocarrier
for the unconjugated nanoparticles.27 Regarding
the conjugated nanoparticle, the cytotoxic ability of allicin was
further improved because of the presence of glycyrrhetinic acid molecules
which actively increase the internalization of the nanocarriers inside
the hepatic cells as a result of a highly specific interaction between
glycyrrhetinic acid and its receptors displayed on the surface of
the hepatic cell, namely, ASGPR.2,15 Glycyrrhetinic acid
was previously reported to increase the uptake of nanoparticles by
liver cells.28 Hence, allicin exerted the
same inhibitory effect at a much lower molar concentration.29 Moreover, glycyrrhetinic acid and its related
compounds were found to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in HepG-2 cell
lines, in addition to its hepatoprotective effect.30

on HepG-2 cells.

2.8 Interaction
of Glycyrrhetinic Acid with Hepatic
ASGPRs Illustrated Using Molecular Docking Studies
The docking
of glycyrrhetinic acid on the carbohydrate part of the liver ASGPR
(lectin) was successful, scoring a binding energy of −11.53
± 0.50 kcal/mol indicating a good ligand–receptor interaction. Figure 5 demonstrates the
successful fitting of glycyrrhetinic acid on the protein receptor
and explains the type of interaction as hydrogen bonding between the
hydroxyl group of glycyrrhetinic acid and the arginine residue of
the ASGPR. These results boast the explanation of the decreased IC50 scores because of better internalization of the glycyrrhetinic
acid-conjugated particles as a direct result of this type of carbohydrate–lectin
interaction.

3 Conclusions
Glycyrrhetinic acid-conjugated
allicin-loaded GNPs pose a successful,
safe, and economic remedy for hepatocellular carcinoma that can be
rapidly processed to animal and human studies. The development of
this new remedy from completely natural components (drug + carrier
+ targeting moiety) is an additional asset.

St. Louis, Mo., USA. Acetone was purchased from Labscan, Dublin, Ireland.
Allicin was purchased from Jiangsu chiataiqingjiang Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., China. Spectra/Por dialysis membrane, 12 000–14 000
molecular weight cutoff, was purchased from Spectrum Laboratories
Inc., Rancho Dominguez, Canada.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Preliminary Screening of Different Human
Cancer Cell Lines for Allicin Cytotoxicity
In order to evaluate
the cytotoxic effects of allicin, different human cancer cell lines
were used, specifically, human hepatocellular cancer cell line (HepG-2),
human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3), human lung cancer cell line
(A-549), and human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7).

The cells
were grown on the RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated
fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL gentamycin. The cells were maintained
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and
were subcultured two to three times a week. The cytotoxicity was evaluated
using viability assay and using MTT test. The used technique is detailed
in the Supporting Information.

4.2.2 Experimental Design and Preparation of Plain
GNPs
GNPs were prepared using the method of double desolvation.
Minor changes were made to the procedure which is described in the
literature by Coester and his colleagues.31 In addition, the D-optimal experimental design was applied to optimize
the independent factors of the method, namely, the amount of the used
cross-linker (GA), cross-linking times (4, 10, and 16 h), and stirring
speeds (700, 1000, and 1300 rpm). The amount of GA added was expressed
either as percentages (33.3, 50, and 66.7% w/w) or as gelatin[NH2]/GA[CHO] molar ratios (1:0.5, 1:1,
and 1:2, respectively). Briefly, 1.25 g of gelatin A (bloom 300) was
dispersed in 25 mL of purified deionized water under continuous mechanical
stirring at 500 rpm, and the temperature was kept at 40–45
°C. The first desolvation step is then performed to precipitate
the HMW gelatin chains which will be then used in the formation of
the nanospheres. As a desolvating agent, 25 mL of acetone was added
to the gelatin dispersion and shortly incubated for 1 min to ensure
complete precipitation of HMW gelatin. The supernatant was discarded,
and the precipitate was redispersed in another 25 mL of purified deionized
water at 40–45 °C using mild stirring. The gelatin dispersion
was then retained acidic to pH 2.5 using 2–3 drops of 5 M HCl.
The second desolvation step is the key step in forming the nanoparticles
where the gelatin dispersion was titrated with 75 mL of acetone dropwise
at 40–45 °C under stirring speeds that were adjusted according
to the design. For stiffening of the GNPs, different amounts of the
cross-linker GA (25% v/v) were added to the nanoparticle dispersion
for different time intervals to initiate intraparticular cross-linking.
To stop the action of GA at the end of a given time interval, the
glycine solution (751 mg/100 mL) was added to block its carboxylic
groups. The mixture was stirred at 500 rpm for 1 h. Eventually, the
GNPs were purified by triplicate centrifugation/redispersion cycles
in purified deionized water.

4.2.3 Determination
of the Practical Yield of
the Prepared Plain GNPs
The optimum formulation of plain
GNPs was used for the determination of the practical amount of the
produced GNPs by the adopted double desolvation method where the GNPs
were prepared at the gelatin[NH2]/GA[CHO] ratio equals 1:2, stirring rate of 700 rpm, and 4 h of cross-linking.
The produced nanoparticle dispersion was then lyophilized (Eyela FDU-2100,
Japan), and the weight of the lyophilizate was determined. During
the preparation of the GNPs and after the precipitation of the HMW
gelatin in the first desolvation step, the formed gel-like precipitate
was left to dry in the desiccator under vacuum for 48 h and then was
also weighed.

The percentage yield of the produced nanoparticles
was calculated in relation to both the weight of the initial added
amount of gelatin (1.25 g) and to the weight of the gel-like precipitate
containing the HMW gelatin. Thus, the following equations were applied    

4.2.4 Particle Size and PDI Measurements for the
Prepared Plain GNPs
Plain GNPs were subjected to the DLS
technique in order to determine their hydrodynamic diameters using
a Malvern Zetasizer (Nano ZS, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). The parameters
of the measurement were adjusted so that the viscosity of pure water
was 0.8872 cP at 25 °C. Data of the particle size were described
as an average mean size. PDIs were measured using the same instrument
under the same conditions. All readings were in triplicates.

4.2.5 Preparation and Characterization of Allicin-Loaded
GNPs
The preparation of allicin-loaded GNPs was achieved
by using the optimized formula (stirring rate of 700 rpm, gelatin[NH2]/GA[CHO] ratio of 1:2 and 4 h cross-linking
time). Incorporation of allicin to GNPs was achieved by adding 50
mg of allicin powder to the 25 mL of purified deionized water which
was used for the redispersion of the gel-like precipitate formed after
the first desolvation step. Before the addition of allicin solution,
the solution was filtered in a 25 mL volumetric flask using a filter
paper of pore size 90 mm. Afterward, the volume of the solution was
adjusted to 25 mL. The absorbance of allicin solution was then measured
spectrophotometrically using the spectrophotometer (Jasco—V-630,
Japan) at λmax of 282.1 nm and compared to a preconstructed
calibration curve of allicin in deionized water to get the actual
amount of allicin used.

4.2.5.1 Entrapment Efficiency
Calculation for
Allicin-Loaded GNPs
For the determination of entrapment efficiency
(% EE), the prepared allicin-loaded nanoparticles were centrifuged
at 15 000 rpm at room temperature for 45 min using the freeze
centrifuge (Sigma—2-16 KL, Germany). The supernatant was discarded,
and the formed nanoparticle cake was digested in 100 mL of 0.1 N HCl
so as to release the entrapped allicin where its amount was also determined
spectrophotometrically using the same instrument (Jasco—V-630,
Japan) against a preconstructed calibration curve of allicin in 0.1
N HCl at λmax of 282.4 nm. At the end, the entrapment
efficiency was calculated as percentage drug entrapped using the following
equation  

4.2.5.2 Particle Size and PDI Measurements for
Allicin-Loaded GNPs
Particle size and PDI was measured for
the prepared allicin-loaded GNPs similarly to those for the plain
GNPs explained in Section 2.2.3.

4.2.5.3 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM JEM-1400 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was
used to investigate the morphology
and homogeneity of the prepared allicin-loaded GNPs at 80 kV voltage.
The sample of GNP suspension was prepared by mounting on a carbon-coated
copper grid and left for air drying at room temperature before imaging.

4.2.6 Conjugation of Allicin-Loaded Nanoparticles
with Glycyrrhetinic Acid for the Enhanced Hepatocellular Uptake
As a preparatory step, the optimized allicin-loaded GNP dispersion
was purified using a dialysis membrane (12 000–14 000
molecular weight cutoff) in a dialyzing medium consisting of distilled
water for 96 h with mild stirring. The dialysis medium was replaced
every 2 h.

To 50 mL of the purified allicin-loaded GNP dispersion,
glycyrrhetinic acid was added in a ratio of 1:10 by weight glycyrrhetinic
acid/GNPs. For ionization of the carboxylic groups of glycyrrhetinic
acid, the medium was rendered alkaline at pH 9 using 5 M NaOH. The
mixture was vigorously stirred till complete dissolution of glycyrrhetinic
acid; then, EDC was added in amount equal to that of glycyrrhetinic
acid. EDC was used as a carboxyl activating agent for the coupling
of primary amines of gelatin amino acids to yield amide bonds with
carboxylic groups of glycyrrhetinic acid.29,32 Stirring was continued for 3 h at room temperature, and then the
produced conjugated allicin-loaded GNP dispersion was purified by
dialysis as previously explained.

4.2.7 1H NMR Spectroscopy for the Conjugated
Allicin-Loaded GNPs
1H NMR spectroscopy was performed
for each of glycyrrhetinic acid, bare allicin-loaded GNPs (unconjugated),
and conjugated allicin-loaded nanoparticles. All liquid samples were
lyophilized (Eyela FDU-2100, Japan) and then dissolved in a mixture
of deuterated acetic acid and DMSO, and their NMR spectra were recorded
on a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker AVANCE III Switzerland). The
produced charts were compared to confirm the conjugation of glycyrrhetinic
acid molecules with the GNPs.

4.2.8 In
Vitro Release Study of the Conjugated
Allicin-Loaded GNPs
The release behavior of allicin from
the conjugated GNPs in PBS of pH 7.4 was investigated in both the
presence and the absence of collagenase enzyme. For different time
intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h), 2 mL of the conjugated allicin-loaded
GNP dispersion was incubated in an Eppendorf tube at 37 ± 1 °C
in 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4 with or without 2 μg/mL collagenase under
continuous shaking at 100–120 rpm. At the end of each time
interval, the suspension was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for
30 min. The amount of allicin in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically
(Jasco—V-630, Japan) at λmax of 283.2 nm,
and the percent released was calculated.

4.2.9 Cytotoxicity
Study of the Conjugated and
Unconjugated GNPs on the HepG-2 Cell Line
Evaluation of the
cytotoxic effect of both conjugated and unconjugated allicin-loaded
GNPs on the human hepatocellular cancer cell line (HepG-2)33 was conducted following the same method described
in Section 4.2.1. The purpose of this final cytotoxicity study was to explore the
enhanced antitumor potential of allicin in unconjugated and conjugated
GNPs compared to native allicin, that is, the effect of nanonization
and ligand–receptor binding on drug internalization, cellular
uptake, and the consequent antitumor effect.

4.2.10 Investigating Glycyrrhetinic Acid–ASPGR
Interaction Using Molecular Docking Studies
The crystal structure
of the carbohydrate recognition domain of the H1 subunit of the ASGPR
was obtained from the RCSB protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) with a code
of 1DV8. The
isomeric SMILES corresponding to the chemical structure of the studied
ligand (carbohydrate); glycyrrhetinic acid was obtained using PubChem.
The corresponding 3D chemical structures were generated using the
builder function of MOE version 2014.0901 (Chemical Computing Group
Inc., Montreal, Canada). Further, energy minimization was performed
using MMFF94x forcefield of the same software.34−36 The docking
analysis was employed using MOE version 2014.0901 (Chemical Computing
Group Inc., Montreal, Canada). The pdb file of the protein nanoparticle
matrix was imported to MOE where the identification of the binding
sites was performed using the MOE’s “Site finder”
tool37 to be ready for docking using the
“triangle matcher” as a placement method. This software
creates dummy atoms around the docking target atoms. These dummy atoms
are considered the docking positions. The software-integrated London
score was utilized for calculating the binding energy scoring value.38−41
