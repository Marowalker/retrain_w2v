We
employ the popular all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulations,
OPLSAA, force-field to model 17 different alcohols in the liquid state.
Using the standard simulation protocol for few hundred nanosecond
time periods, we find that 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol undergo
spontaneous transition to a crystalline state at temperatures which
are 35–55 K higher than the experimental melting temperatures.
Nevertheless, the crystal structures obtained from the simulations
are very similar to those determined by X-ray powder diffraction data
for several n-alcohols. Although some degree of deviations
from the experimental freezing points are to be expected, for 1-nonanol
and 1-decanol, the elevation of the freezing temperature warrants
special attention because at room temperature, these alcohols are
liquids; however, if simulated by the OPLSAA force-field, they will
crystallize. This behavior is likely a consequence of exaggerated
attractive interactions between the alkane chains of the alcohols.
To circumvent this problem, we combined the OPLSAA model with the
L-OPLS force-field. We adopted the L-OPLS parameters to model the
hydrocarbon tail of the alcohols, whereas the hydroxyl head group
remained as in the original OPLSAA force-field. The resulting alcohols
stayed in the liquid state at temperatures above their experimental
melting points, thus, resolving the enhanced freezing observed with
the OPLSAA force-field. In fact, the mixed-model alcohols did not
exhibit any spontaneous freezing even at temperatures much lower than
the experimental values. However, a series of simulations in which
these mixed-OPLSAA alcohols started from a coexistence configuration
of the liquid and solid phases resulted in freezing transitions at
temperatures 14–25 K lower than the experimental values, confirming
the validity of the proposed model. For all of the other alcohols,
the mixed model yields results very similar to the OPLSAA force-field
and is in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, for simulating
alcohols in the liquid phase, the mixed-OPLSAA model is necessary
for large (7 carbons and above) hydrocarbon chains.

Introduction
Alcohols are an important
class of molecules with many scientific,
medical, and commercial applications. Being associative liquids, they
function as good solvents for chemical reactions in the lab as well
as in industrial productions. Their importance has also been augmented
by their utilization in the development of alternative energy sources.1 Therefore, the ability to describe accurately
their properties in computer simulations is highly desired.

The optimized potential for liquid simulation (OPLS),2,3 and especially its all-atom version OPLSAA,4,5 is
arguably considered to be the best overall force-field to described
small organic molecules in the liquid state. The main reason for its
success is likely the choice to determine the partial atomic charges
in a molecule empirically by reproducing the thermodynamic properties
of the corresponding liquid phase, such as density, enthalpy of vaporization,
and in some cases, free energy of hydration. It is interesting to
mention that more elegant, and seemingly more rigorous, procedures
to assign charges to a molecule, such as the restrained electrostatic
potential6 of the Amber force-field, often
suffer from difficulties to reproduce thermodynamic properties of
the neat liquid7 or kinetic properties
of ionic liquids.8,9

As with few other force-fields,
it is remarkable that the OPLSAA
has survived two decades of hardware and software computer improvements
which resulted in few orders of magnitude longer simulation times,
much larger system size, and a more accurate calculation of the long-range
electrostatic forces. For example, an extensive study on the conformational
populations of a homologous series of alkane chains from n-butane to n-dodecane reported a close agreement
with the experimental data.10 Nevertheless,
for n-heptane and longer alkanes, the calculated
heat of vaporization was substantially larger than the experimental
value, suggesting overestimation of the intermolecular attractions
in the liquid state. Another evidence supporting the assumption of
exaggerated attractive forces between long alkane molecules comes
from the transition temperature between liquid and gel phases of pentadecane.
This temperature is predicted by the OPLSAA force-field to be much
higher than the experimental temperature.11

These shortcomings and their consequence in impeding adequate
description
of lipids with the OPLSAA force-field have prompted Siu et al. to
propose modifications to the partial charges and the Lennard-Jones
parameters of the atoms in hydrocarbons.11 In addition, the coefficients defining the potential function of
several dihedral angles were also changed. The resulting set of parameters,
referred to as the L-OPLS, have been shown to fix the above-mentioned
problems encountered with the original force-field.

Recently,
we investigated the structure and self-assembly of methanol
molecules confined between two, or adsorbed on, graphene sheets.12 In the process of extending this study for larger
molecules, we tested the behavior of the bulk liquid phase (in three
dimensions) at ambient conditions of a series of larger alcohols.
However in this case, we observed that within few hundred nanoseconds,
1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol, when described by the OPLSAA
force-field, spontaneously undergo a sharp first-order transition
from liquid to solid. It is reasonable to assume that the excessive
intermolecular attractive forces observed for long alkane chains is
likely the reason for elevation in the freezing temperature. Therefore,
we combined the original OPLSAA with the L-OPLS force-fields to model
alcohols. The former was considered for the description of the hydroxyl
head-group, whereas the latter was utilized to describe the hydrocarbon
tail. We checked 17 alcohols of different types (primary and secondary,
as well as, mono-, di-, and tri-alcohols) and compared their physical
properties to those obtained using the original OPLSAA parameters.
In addition, for 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol,
we studied the temperature-induced transition to the solid or glassy
state for both alcohol models.

We note that there are few studies
in the literature reporting
refinements of the OPLSAA force-field for alkanes13 and alcohols.14 However, they
focused on shorter aliphatic chains and apparently have not resolved
the problems faced when simulating long-chain hydrocarbons.11 In another study, Kulschewski and Pleiss reparametrized
the OPLSAA force-field for alcohols, aiming to minimize the discrepancies
between the calculated and experimentally determined diffusion constants.15 To this end, they modified the partial charges
of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl group and assigned
different values for each alcohol molecule studied. However, besides
abolishing transferability, the enthalpies of vaporization that their
new models would exhibit have not been assessed. This and our inference
that the elevation of the freezing temperature originates from inaccurate
parameters of the alkane chain have led us to adopt the L-OPLS refinement.

Results
and Discussion
In Table 1, we present
the bulk densities of 17 alcohols considered in this study (see Figure 1) for the original
OPLSAA and the mixed-OPLSAA force-fields at ambient conditions of T = 298.15 K and P = 1 bar. Note that the
description of methanol is identical in both models; nevertheless,
we still considered it independently twice as an additional check
for the convergence of the results. Examining the series of primary
mono-alcohols (alkanols), as expected, the difference between the
two models increases with the length of the hydrocarbon chain. Up
to 1-hexanol, the difference relative to the experimental value is
small, lower than 0.4%. This difference continues to increase for
heptanol and octanol, but still lower than 1%. For all of the primary
mono-alcohols, the OPLSAA densities are larger than their corresponding
mixed-OPLSAA values, and from butanol to octanol, they are also closer
to the experimental values. For nonanol and decanol, the difference
between the two models jumps to 13%, where now the values derived
from the mixed-OPLSAA model are by far the ones closer to the experimental
values. As shown below, these large deviations of the OPLSAA model
for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol are due to a phase transition to a crystalline
state already at a temperature of 298.15 K. For all other alcohols,
the difference between the densities of the two force-fields (relative
to the experimental value) is again very small, up to 0.3% and, in
most cases, the OPLSAA model is closer to the experimental data. For
2-propanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol, both models exhibit large
deviations in the density compared with the corresponding experimental
values. Interestingly, the magnitude of these deviations are all around
3.5%.

not considered.

The enthalpies
of vaporization calculated by eq 1 are displayed in Table 2 (the values of Ugas and Uliquid are given in Table S4). For all alcohols studied, the value
obtained by the OPLSAA force-field is larger than that of the mixed-OPLSAA
model, except for 2-propanol for which both values are similar. Inspecting
the series of the primary mono-alcohols up to 1-octanol, the difference
in the heat of vaporization between two models is smaller than 2 kJ/mol.
For 1-propanol and 1-butanol, the OPLSAA values are closer to experiments,
nonetheless, even with the mixed-OPLSAA model, the relative deviations
of the computed heats of vaporization from the experimental values
are equal or less than 5%. For 1-pentanol and above, the mixed-OPLSAA
model performs better when compared to the experimental data. We note
that for alcohols larger than pentanol, the enthalpies of vaporization
calculated from the simulations, using either of the force-fields,
are larger than the experimental values. However, as was the case
for the densities, the striking observations are the values of the
OPLSAA for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol which deviates from the experimental
data by 26 and 29 kJ/mol, respectively. This is easy to understand
because, as mentioned above, these alcohols described by the OPLSAA
force-field are solids at T = 298.15 K and therefore,
their calculated “heat of vaporization” is actually
the heat of sublimation, or the sum of the heat of vaporization and
the heat of fusion. Experimentally,20 the
heats of fusion of 1-nonanol and 1-decanol were found to be 28.80
and 37.66 kJ/mol. Thus, if we subtract these values from the calculated
“heats of vaporization” for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol,
as shown in Table 2, we obtain 73.81 and 73.22 kJ/mol, respectively. For 1-nonanol,
this vaporization enthalpy is quite similar to the experimental value;
however, for 1-decanol, it differs by 8 kJ/mol. We note however that
a different study21 determined the heat
of sublimation of 1-decanol at 298 K to be 112.5 kJ/mol which is very
close to the value of 110.88 kJ/mol obtained by the OPLSAA force field.
The OPLSAA and the mixed models display a similar performance (within
a range of 3 kJ/mol) for the calculated enthalpies of vaporization
for the secondary alcohols, diols, and glycerol. Although, the mixed-OPLSAA
model is slightly closer to the experimental values, in most cases,
the difference between the two models is much smaller than the deviation
from the experimental data. Nevertheless, the agreement with the values
obtained from experiments is quite good, except for 1,2-propanediol,
glycerol, and 1,3-propanediol which display relative deviations of
about 8%, 10%, and 17%, respectively.

Table 3 shows the
self-diffusion coefficient of different alcohols. For most of the
alcohols, the value obtained from the OPLSAA force-field is smaller
than that of the mixed-OPLSAA model. For the rest, the diffusion coefficient
is the same (within the estimated errors) and only for 2-propanol,
it is larger for the OPLSAA force-field. In comparison with the experimental
results and considering the range of values reported in the literature,
both models perform reasonably well for the primary mono-alcohols
up to 1-pentanol, where the
OPLSAA exhibits even closer values to the experimental data. From
1-hexanol and above, the mixed-OPLSAA continues to perform well; however,
the OPLSAA displays retarded dynamics which is intensified with the
length of the hydrocarbon tail of the alcohol. Obviously, this is
expected for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol because of the transitions to
crystals; however, the OPLSAA values for 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, and
1-octanol suggest that the onset of the effect operates already at
shorter alcohols. Although, we were not able to find experimental
data for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol, the magnitudes of diffusion coefficients
of the mixed-OPLSAA model characterize a liquid phase, as is known
to be the case experimentally at T = 298.15 K, much
more than the values found for the OPLSAA model. For the other alcohols,
the experimental data indicate that the OPLSAA is performing slightly
better than, or similar to, the mixed-OPLSAA model. Large difference
between the two models is observed for 4-heptanol; however, also in
this case, we could not find experimental data that prevent assessment.
The alcohols displaying the largest, and substantial, disagreement
with the experimental data are 3-pentanol, glycerol, and in particular,
1,2-propanediol.

a For few alcohols, no experimental
values were found.

We also
calculated the relative permittivity of the alcohols described
by both models and summarized the results in Table S5. The mixed-OPLSAA exhibits very similar values (within the
estimated errors) to the original OPLSAA model. This is not surprising
given that the polar hydroxyl group(s) of the alcohols are unaltered
between the two models. As reported previously in the literature,33 the OPLSAA model deviates substantially relative
to the experimental results. In all cases, the computed values are
smaller than those determined experimentally, except for 4-heptanol
and 1,3-propanediol. For the former, the modeled values reproduce
well, whereas for the latter, they are larger than the experimental
data.

The augmentation of the retarded diffusion with the length
of the
hydrocarbon chain displayed in Table 3 for the OPLSAA force-field led us to speculate that
shorter alcohols, for example, 1-octanol and 1-heptanol, might also
exhibit melting or freezing temperatures which are much higher than
in experiments. To examine this conjecture and to determine the freezing
temperatures for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol, we performed additional
series of simulations in which we started from the liquid state at
high temperatures and gradually cooled down the systems. A freezing
transition in three-dimensional liquid is known to occur via a discontinuous,
first-order transition. This is a sharp transition in which the densities
of the two phases differ substantially; therefore, in Figure 2, we plot the density as a
function of temperature for the original OPLSAA and the mixed-OPLSAA
models. For 1-decanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-octanol described by the OPLSAA
force-field, there is a clear and significant jump in the density
at, respectively, T ≃ 327.5, 322.5, and 294
K, suggesting a transition to a dense solid phase. At these freezing
temperatures, there are also concomitant drops of the diffusion coefficients
(displayed in Figure 3) to very small values demonstrating transitions of the systems from
fluids to solid states. The experimental melting temperatures of these
three alcohols are16 280, 268, and 258.5
K, respectively, which means the melting temperatures predicted by
the OPLSAA is about 35–55 K higher than the experimental values.
For decanol and nonanol, this is critical because simulating these
alcohols at ambient temperatures in which they are supposed to be
liquids would transform them to solids. In contrast, for the mixed-OPLSAA
model, the change of the density is linear without any signature of
a phase transition. In addition, the corresponding diffusion constants
also exhibit only gradual monotonic decreases with decreasing the
temperature without any sharp drop. The values of these diffusion
constants, as well as the shape of the mean-squared displacement (MSD)
as a function of time (not shown), just above the experimental melting
temperatures indicate that these mixed-OPLSAA alcohols are in the
liquid state. As the temperature is decreased further, the dynamics
continues to slow down; however, no first-order transition to a solid
state is detected even when cooled down 60 K below the corresponding
experimental melting temperatures. Therefore, it is likely that at
some temperature, these alcohols transform into a supercooled liquid
or a glassy state as can also be observed experimentally.34

Note that for the OPLSAA model, 1-decanol and 1-nonanol at T = 298.15 K started to display an increase in the density
and a growth of the crystal nuclei already after the first 10 ns,
whereas for 1-octanol at T = 280 K, it required approximately
200 ns. Obviously, one can argue that the time scale of the simulations
is much smaller than the relaxation time required for a freezing transition
of the mixed-OPLSAA alcohols, and that the relaxation times observed
for the OPLSAA model is much faster than the actual experimental relaxation
times. A first-order transition is known to exhibit hysteresis (ergodicity
breaking). Thus, the transition temperature of freezing a liquid is
lower than that of melting a crystal. Therefore, to assess the extent
of hysteresis in these systems, we performed an additional series
of simulations in which we started from the crystal structure at a
low temperature and gradually (after 50 ns) heated up the system to
the next sampled temperature. At each temperature, a minimum of 100
ns simulation time was conducted. Longer simulations, up to 400 ns,
were performed at temperatures just below those in which a melting
transition was observed. The starting structure for both models was
taken from the lowest temperature configuration of the spontaneous
crystallization of the OPLSAA model. For 1-heptanol where no such
structure existed, the starting structure was adapted from that of
1-octanol by replacing the terminal methyl group with a hydrogen.
The results are displayed in Figure 4 indicating that the alcohols described by the mixed-OPLSAA
melt at temperatures near (nonetheless, always higher than) those
of the experimental melting points, with deviations in the range of
5–17 K. However, the alcohols described by the OPLSAA model
melt at significantly higher temperatures with deviations in the range
of 64–107 K relative to the experimental data.

Figure 4 Similar to Figure 2, however, in this case, the
series of simulations started from a
crystal structure at the lowest temperature and then gradually heated
up (see text).

Figures 2 and 4 indicate these
systems display large hysteresis,
and there is a need for a more accurate determination of the freezing/melting
temperatures. To this end, we conducted additional series of simulations
for 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol where the starting configuration
of the system at each temperature was a coexistence of the crystal
and liquid phases.35,36 This starting configuration,
which was the same at each temperature, was taken from a corresponding
simulation of the spontaneous crystallization observed above for the
OPLSAA model (about halfway of the freezing process). The results
are summarized in Figure 5, where the density of the phase formed is plotted as a function
of the temperature. Furthermore, the evolution of the instantaneous
density above and below the transition temperature in the case of
the OPLSAA model is shown in Figure S1.
These figures indicate that the freezing/melting temperature of 1-decanol,
1-nonanol, and 1-octanol using the OPLSAA model is around 335, 325,
and 304 K, respectively, that is, values that are up to 10° higher
than those determined based on spontaneous crystallization from the
liquid state (Figure 2). In contrast, the freezing/melting temperature of 1-decanol, 1-nonanol,
and 1-octanol using the mixed-OPLSAA model is around 255, 255, and
245 K which are only 14–25 K lower than the experimental temperatures.

Figure 5 Similar
to Figures 2 and 4, however, in this case, the starting
configuration of the system at each temperature was a coexistence
(the same configuration for all temperatures) of the liquid and solids
states.

Although, from Figures 2 and 3, it is clear that 1-decanol,
1-nonanol, and 1-octanol of the OPLSAA model undergo spontaneous temperature-induced
transition to a solid state, and the nature of this solid has not
been revealed yet. In Figure 6, we present snapshots of the last configuration for these
alcohols at a temperature just below the freezing transition. In these
three cases, the alcohols transformed into an ordered crystal in which
the long axis of the molecule is perpendicular to a layered structure.
Within each layer, the alcohols form a hexagonal lattice. This is
clearly displayed in Figure 7 where the in-plane structure of only a slice of the simulation
box that includes a single layer is shown. The same hexagonal structure
can also be seen in Figure S2 which is
a view on the entire simulation box along the long-axis of the molecules
(thus, a rotation by 90° of the structure shown in Figure 6). These features are in agreement
with the crystal structures found by X-ray powder diffraction data
for several n-alcohols including 1-butanol,34 1-pentanol,37 1-octanol,38 and even for much longer n-alcohol
chains with 11–37 carbon atoms.39,40 In most cases,
an alcohol can exhibit few crystal phases (depending on the temperature)
that mainly differ in the orientational order, and the tilting degree,
of the long-axis of the molecules, as well as in trans or gauche bond
conformations involving the hydroxyl group atoms. Nevertheless, in
all cases, a layered structure is formed by hydrogen bonds between
the hydroxyl groups of different alcohols, and the long-axis of the
molecules is either perpendicular or tilted with respect to the plane
of the layers. In the latter, the long-axes orientations of the molecules
can then form a zigzag pattern, as obtained in Figure 6, for 1-octanol and 1-nonanol, or a parallel
arrangement. Experimentally 1-octanol38 at 150 K and 1-pentanol37 at 183 K exhibit
a much stronger zigzag pattern than that displayed in Figure 6. Besides the difference in
the temperatures, a plausible reason for the discrepancy is that the
cubic shape of the simulation box suppresses larger tilting between
the layers.

Figure 6 Snapshot of the last frame of the simulation of 1-octanol, 1-nonanol,
and 1-decanol for the two investigated force-field models. In the
OPLSAA case (left column), the chosen simulation is for the highest
temperature for which crystallization occurs, whereas for the mixed-OPLSAA
case (right column), it is for the lowest temperature studied.

Figure 7 Slice of the snapshot of 1-octanol shown in Figure 6 that includes (for
clarity) only a single
layer of alcohols. The plane of the layer coincides with the plane
of the image. The drawings of the two perfect hexagons are a guide
for identifying the hexagonal in-plane structure within each layer.
The green hexagon includes alcohols in which their hydroxyl groups
point downward, whereas for the yellow hexagon, the hydroxyl groups
point upward.

Nonetheless, the most
substantial discrepancy between the simulation
results and the experimental structure is that in the former within
each layer, the hydroxyl group is pointing up and down as displayed,
for example, by the yellow and green hexagons in Figure 7. It is clear that this does
not correspond to the lowest (free) energy minimum. When all of the
hydroxyl groups within each layer would point in one direction, then
the adjacent layers can interact with one another via only the hydroxyl
groups (head–head) and via only the alkane chains (tail–tail)
in an alternate way. The relaxation times for this type of ordering
is likely to be much longer than the time period for which we are
able to perform the simulations, and therefore, the simulations did
not result in an equilibrated crystal structure (although it is possible
to identify regions in which one side of a layer has excess, whereas
the opposite side is depleted, of hydroxyl groups). In Figure 8a, we present the radial distribution
function between the carbon atoms of the alcohols indicating that
the phases formed by 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol exhibit long-range
order and that the structures of these crystals are very similar to
one another. The curves for the OPLSAA were calculated from the simulations
of the spontaneous crystallization from the disordered liquid state
(see Figure S3), whereas those for the
mixed-OPLSAA were calculated from the simulations starting from a
coexistence of liquid/solid phases. Nevertheless, the structures of
the crystals obtained using the OPLSAA model are more ordered than
those of the mixed-OPLSAA.

Figure 8 Radial distribution function between the carbon
atoms (excluding
intramolecular correlations) of 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol
for the two force-field models. The OPLSAA distributions were obtained
from simulations in which the liquid states were spontaneously crystallized,
whereas the mixed-OPLSAA distributions were taken from the simulations
in which the starting conformations included a coexistence of the
liquid and solid phases. In all cases, the temperature considered
is the highest temperature supporting the solid phase.

Qualitatively, both models exhibit the same behavior
with a temperature
decrease for 1-heptanol. The curves in Figures 2 and 3 lack any evidence
for a transition to a solid state. The OPLSAA model exhibits slightly
larger densities and smaller diffusion constants compared to the mixed-OPLSAA
model. The difference between two models is largest around T = 220 K, and we do not know whether longer simulations
would have allowed a transformation to solid. In Figure S4, we plot a snapshot of the last configuration at
the lowest temperature for the two models confirming that both systems
are disordered and no transition to a crystalline phase occurred.
The short-range order is also evident by the fast decay of the correlations
in the radial distribution function shown in Figure S5. On the basis of the results obtained for 1-heptanol, we
assume that also shorter OPLSAA alcohols will not crystallize at lower
temperatures and the behavior would be similar to the mixed-OPLSAA
model.

To address concerns that the spontaneous crystallizations
of the
OPLSAA model reported above arise because of the type of barostat
used41 or, alternatively, because the random
distribution of the molecules in starting configurations we prepared
contained some degree of order, we performed two additional series
of simulations for the OPLSAA model: the first with the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat42 (referenced to 1 bar with a
time constant of 2 ps) and the second with the Berendsen barostat
(as before). However, the starting configurations were taken from
simulations of the corresponding gas phase simulated for 25 ns at
1000 K. In both cases, we considered the 1-nonanol and 1-decanol systems
at T = 298.15 K and 1-octanol at T = 280 K. These two independent series of simulations reproduced
the three spontaneous crystallization transitions from the liquid
states reported above. In Table S6, we
provide the densities obtained for the crystals. These densities are
slightly lower than those obtained from the simulations reported in Figure 2 (which conducted
by slowly reducing the temperature), nevertheless, the crystal structures
formed are very similar, as evidenced by the radial distribution function
shown in Figure S6.

Conclusions
In
this article, we find that the OPLSAA force-field for 1-octanol,
1-nonanol, and 1-decanol leads to spontaneous crystallization from
the liquid phase at temperatures which are about 35–55 K higher
than the experimental melting temperatures. Estimation of the melting
temperatures starting from a coexistence of the solid and liquid phases
resulted with even higher values, approximately 50 K above those determined
experimentally. This overestimation of the melting temperature is
especially important for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol because at ambient
conditions (T ≈ 300 K), these alcohols are
liquids; however, if simulated using the OPLSAA model, they will spontaneously
crystallize. It is likely that this deficiency, which in the series
of primary mono-alcohols intensifies with the length of the alkane
chain, is closely related to the reports in the literature of the
large deviations in the behavior of OPLSAA hydrocarbons from experiments.
To rectify the description of these hydrocarbons, small changes have
been introduced to several nonbonded parameters and dihedral angles
in what is known as the L-OPLS force-field. We therefore incorporated
this L-OPLS description into the original OPLSAA force-field to model
various types of alcohols. These mixed-OPLSAA alcohols, including
1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol, remained in the liquid state
at temperatures above their experimental melting points, thus, resolving
the crystallization issue of the original OPLSAA model. Furthermore,
simulations starting from a coexistence of the liquid and solid phases
enabled the determination of their melting temperatures to be 14–25
K lower than the experimental values.

For simulation time periods
considered here, a similar temperature-induced
study for 1-heptanol described by the OPLSAA model did not exhibit
any transition, and we speculate that shorter alcohols will not crystallize
as well. For all other alcohols studied, which include a relatively
short hydrocarbon chain, both models give similar results and reproduce
reasonably well experimental data. Nevertheless, for short alkanols
(1-pentanol or shorter) as well as for 3-pentanol and glycerol, the
original OPLSAA version actually slightly outperforms the mixed model.

Except for a few cases, the OPLSAA model yields densities and enthalpies
of vaporization larger, whereas diffusion constants smaller than the
mixed-OPLSAA model. This is because the changes introduced in the
L-OPLS parameters lead to weaker attractions between the alkane chains.
The effect is demonstrated in Table S7,
where we calculated the nonbonded energy between (as well as within)
the alcohol molecules. In all cases, except for three, the energy
derived from the mixed-OPLSAA model is larger (i.e., weaker attractive
forces) than the OPLSAA model. This shifts the mixed-OPLSAA freezing
temperatures of 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol to lower values.
In fact, we were not able to observe the spontaneous crystallization
from a pure liquid phase in any of the mixed-OPLSAA alcohols examined,
even when the temperature dropped to 60 K below the corresponding
experimental freezing point. However, a series simulations in which
these mixed-model alcohols were gradually heated up from the crystal
structures at low temperatures resulted in melting transitions at
temperatures 5–17 K higher than the experimentally determined
melting temperatures.

We performed also simulations of only
the tail segment of the alcohols,
that is, the corresponding alkanes from n-heptane
to n-decane. The results, as shown in Table 4, indicate that although the
heat of vaporization is better described by the L-OPLS force field,
the densities, except for decane, are closer to the experimental values
when the alkanes are described by the OPLSAA force-field. Therefore,
in the absence of the hydrophilic head group, for example, for alkanes,
the exaggeration of the attractive interactions between the hydrocarbon
molecules is diminished compared to that found in alkanols, and an
obvious out-performance of the L-OPLS force field is evident only
for decane. In fact, given the trends in the performance of both force-fields
for the primary mono-alcohols and for n-alkanes,
it might be that developing a transferable nonpolarizable force-field
describing the gas, liquid, and solid states with high-fidelity is
extremely difficult, if not impossible. One obvious obstacle is the
fixed partial charges of the atoms in the molecule despite the different
dielectric constants of its surrounding because of the different structures
of these three states. In addition, the incorporation of polar groups
into the molecule (such as when constructing an alcohol model from
an alkane) can result in significant changes in the fixed partial
charges or in induced dipoles challenging the transferability for
nonpolarizable force-fields. Here, it is interesting to point out
that a refinement of the OPLSAA force-field for carbohydrates found
it necessary to apply scaling factors for the 1,5 and 1,6 electrostatic
interactions.43

a These results were obtained from
simulations with 200 ns equilibration time and 40 ns data-collection
time using the same protocol as for the simulations of the alcohols.
Experimental values were taken from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry
and Physics.16 Error estimates for the
densities were around 0.05 kg/m3 or lower.

Interestingly, the structures of
the alcohol crystals obtained
in the simulations are very similar to those deducted by X-ray powder
diffraction data of various n-alcohols. In particular,
a layered structure was formed by hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl
groups, perpendicular or tilted orientations of the long-axis of the
molecule with respect to the layer’s plane, and hexagonal arrangement
of the molecules within the layers. The major discrepancy observed
is that within each layer, the hydroxyl groups are pointing in both
directions, whereas experimentally they point only toward one direction.

Methods
We simulated 17 different alcohols in the bulk liquid state. These
model alcohols (see Figure 1) include primary mono-alcohols (methanol to 1-decanol), secondary
mono-alcohols (2-propanol, 3-pentanol, and 4-heptanol), diols (ethylene
glycol, 1,3-propanediol, and 1,2-propanediol) and a triol (glycerol).
Each system was composed of 864 molecules in a cubic-shaped box with
a size ranging from 3.9 nm (for the smallest system of methanol) to
6.3 nm (for the largest system of 1-decanol). The starting configuration
for each system was obtained by placing the alcohol molecules randomly
in a large box and then compressing the system toward its bulk liquid
density via the application of a barostat. Upon reaching a density
in the vicinity of the bulk value, each system was then equilibrated
for 60 ns, and subsequently data were collected for an additional
40 ns simulation time.

The molecular dynamics package GROMACS
version 4.6.544 was utilized to perform
all simulations, employing
the leap-frog algorithm to integrate Newton’s equations of
motion with a time step of 2 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were
applied in all three dimensions. Electrostatic interactions were calculated
by the PME45 method. The cut-off distance
defining the real space was 1.2 nm, and the grid spacing for the reciprocal
space was 0.12 nm with quadratic interpolation. Lennard-Jones interactions
were evaluated by a single cut-off distance of 1.2 nm with long-range
dispersion corrections for the energy and pressure. The system was
maintained at a temperature of 298.15 K by the velocity-rescaling
thermostat46 with τT = 0.1 ps and at a pressure of 1.0 bar by the Berendsen thermostat47 with τP =
1.0 ps and a compressibility of 1 × 10–5 1/bar.
All covalent bonds were described by harmonic potentials except those
involving hydrogen atoms. In the latter case, the bonds were constrained
using the LINCS algorithm.48

To calculate
the enthalpy of vaporization per mole of liquid 1  the difference
in the energy, U, between the gas and liquid states
were evaluated (R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, P is the pressure, and V is the volume).
Therefore, we also conducted simulations of one molecule of the corresponding
alcohol in vacuum. In this case, simulations were performed at constant
volume in which the cubic box had a length of 12.0 nm. Temperature
thermostat was applied as above. The Lennard-Jones and electrostatic
interactions were calculated by a cut-off distance of 2.8 nm, which
in all cases, was larger than the size of the alcohol molecule in
the box. This means that all pair interactions were calculated exactly
and larger cut-off distances yielded identical results. Each system
was equilibrated for 50 ns, and data were collected for additional
200 ns.

In a second series of simulations, we investigated the
temperature-induced
(keeping the pressure at 1 bar) phase transition from the liquid to
the solid state for four primary mono-alcohols (1-decanol, 1-nonanol,
1-octanol, and 1-heptanol). In these cases, the last frames obtained
from the simulations at T = 298.15 K were taken as
the starting configurations for the simulations at the adjacent higher
(310 K) and lower (290 K) temperatures. Then, the configurations obtained
from these simulations after a minimum propagation of 100 ns were
served as starting structures for the subsequent higher and lower
temperatures, and so on. At each temperature, each system was equilibrated
for at least 260 ns, and then data were collected for additional 40
ns. For systems in which the density did not exhibit convergence,
we extended the equilibration time up to 510 ns. The errors in thermodynamic
quantities obtained from the simulations were estimated using the
block averaging method.49

The alcohol
molecules were described by the all-atom OPLSAA force-field.4 The relevant nonbonded interaction parameters
are presented in Table S1. Recently, the
OPLSAA parameters for hydrocarbons were refined aiming to improve
the representation of long aliphatic chains.11 This L-OPLS force-field modified several of the nonbonded parameters
and dihedral angles. The modified parameters relevant to the description
of the alcohol molecules considered in this study are shown in Tables S2 and S3. Therefore for comparison, all
simulations were also conducted with the description of the alkane
chain taken from the L-OPLS force-field, keeping the parameters of
the hydroxyl group, as well as the partial charges of the first methylene
group (which is covalently bonded to the hydroxyl group), the same
as in the original OPLSAA force-field. Hereafter, we refer to this
combined set of parameters as the “mixed-OPLSAA” force-field.

The self-diffusion coefficient, D, was obtained
from a linear regression of the plot of the single-particle MSD as
a function of time using Einstein’s relation 2  where t is a time
interval
and Δr2(t) is the
MSD of the particles during this time interval, calculated by the
following expression 3  where N is the number of
particles in the system, and the brackets on the left-hand side indicate
an average over different time origins of the trajectory. The linear
regression is fitted using the least-squares method ignoring the 10%
segments at the beginning and the end of the MSD plot. To estimate
the error of D, the fit interval is divided into
two halves. The difference between the values of D obtained from each of these half fit intervals is taken as the error
estimate of D.
