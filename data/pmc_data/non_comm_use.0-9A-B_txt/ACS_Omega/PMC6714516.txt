The kinetics and mechanism of the
antioxidant activities of the
methanolic extract of the leaves of two vegetables [Corchorus olitorius (C. olitorius) and Vernonia amygdalina (V. amygdalina)] have been studied using experimental
and theoretical approaches. The kinetics (second order and pseudo-first
order) of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging
activities of the leaf extracts at varying times (30–90 min)
were determined using the UV–visible spectrophotometry method
at λmax = 517 nm, whereas the mechanism was studied
by density functional theory at two levels of functionals (B3LYP and
LC-ωPBE) using bond dissociation enthalpy and adiabatic ionization
potential values. Molecular properties such as the highest occupied
molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, electronegativity
(χ), electrophilicity (ω), hardness (η), and softness
(S) of the predominant phenolic antioxidants were
also compared. The second-order kinetics is favored by both plants
rather than pseudo-first order; however, V. amygdalina with a second-order rate constant k2 of 0.0152 (mM)−1 min–1 is faster
in scavenging DPPH radicals than C. olitorius with a k2 value of 0.0093 (mM)−1min–1. Chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide,
which are the most abundant phenolic acid antioxidant in C. olitorius and V. amygdalina, both preferably scavenge the DPPH radical via a hydrogen atom transfer
mechanism. This is evident from their lower bond dissociation enthalpy
values than the adiabatic ionization potential values. Successful
molecular docking of these phenolic compounds indicates that both
compounds form favorable interactions with the therapeutic target,
xanthine oxidase.

Introduction
The roles played by
free radicals and oxidative agents in the formation
of cell toxins, which causes changes in the cell structure and the
destruction of its vitality, cannot be overemphasized.1 Human cell protection against oxidation damage caused by
free radicals has attracted a lot of attention from medical scientists.2 Thus, the development of antioxidants that can
scavenge and enervate free radicals has been of significant importance.
Recently, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to finding
foods of plant origin that possess antioxidant activities.2 Plants that are rich in phenolic acids have been
extensively studied and reported to be active against oxidative agents
and free radicals.3 Phenolic acids are
classified as secondary metabolites that possess health-promoting
properties found in vegetables and fruits. They are widely spread
throughout the plant kingdom, and the antioxidant quality of a plant
is related to its phenolic content.4,5 Phenolic acids
are phenols that possess a carboxylic acid functionality. They contain
two distinguishing constitutive carbon frameworks: the hydroxycinnamic
and hydroxybenzoic structures.6

A
large number of species in the Vernonia genus have been widely
used as food and in medicine.7Vernonia amygdalina is one of the most common species
used for these purposes. It is a shrub that is common to both Africa
and Asia, and the plant’s extracts have been reported to be
effective against amebic dysentery and gastrointestinal disorders.8,9 Phytochemical screening of the methanolic extracts of the plant’s
leaves reveals the presence of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids,
alkaloids, anthraquinones, terpenes, saponins, coumarins, steroids,
and phenolic acids.10−12V. amygdalina leaves
are widely consumed because of their good source of antioxidants.13 Phenolic acid species in V. amygdalina play a major role in the antioxidant activity of the plant, and
the most abundant phenolic antioxidant in the methanolic extract of
the plant’s leaves is luteolin-7-O-glucuronide,14Figure 1a.

Figure 1 (a) Luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide and (b) chlorogenic acid.

Corchurus olitorius (also called
Jute mallow) belongs to the genus Corchurus, and is an edible vegetable
that either grows wildly or is cultivated in tropical Africa and in
Asia.15 The leaf extracts of the plant
have been reported to exhibit a significantly high antioxidant activity
among other consumable vegetables, and the role of phenolic acids
in the relatively high antioxidant activity has been highlighted.16 A quantitative study of the relative abundance
of antioxidants in the methanolic extract of C. olitorius leaves reveals that 5-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid) (Figure 1b) is the predominant
phenolic compound contributing to the antioxidant activity of the
plant.17

Many investigations18−20 have been carried out to understand the kinetics
and mechanisms of radical scavenging activities of phenolic antioxidants.
According to the literature, the kinetics of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) free radical scavenging activities of phenolic antioxidants
in the extracts of different plant species has been compared. Phenolics
from red sweet potato scavenge DPPH radicals faster than phenolics
from blue berries.21 Different rates of
reaction of ten tropical food extracts with free radicals have also
been reported in another study.22

The activity of a phenolic compound against free radicals is majorly
dependent on the structural properties of the phenolic compound.

For good radical scavenging activity, the phenolic compounds should
have the following structural characteristics:23occurrence of multiple
OH groups attached to the aromatic
ring;

arrangement of these hydroxyls
in the ortho-dihydroxy
conformation, when possible;

planar structure
of phenolics, which allows conjugation
and electronic delocalization, as well as resonance effects; and

the presence of additional functional groups,
such as
the carbon–carbon double bond and the C=O carbonyl group.



An understanding of this relationship provides
the information
about the mechanism of radical scavenging activities of antioxidants.24 Phenolics scavenge free radicals usually via
any of the following three mechanisms:23(i) Hydrogen
atom transfer (HAT) 1  

(ii) Single electron
transfer (SET) 2  

(iii) Sequential proton
loss-electron
transfer (SPLET) 3   4   5  

The main mechanisms commonly employed for
investigating the
capability of phenolics to scavenge free radicals are the hydrogen
atom transfer (HAT) and single electron transfer (SET).19,25−28 The sequential proton loss-electron transfer (SPLET) mechanism has
been less studied to date,29−31 especially by computational methods,
although it is also a relevant reaction path for investigating antioxidant
activity.32 In fact, the SPLET mechanism
was reported to be favored experimentally in solvents that support
X–H ionization when compared to the always present HAT process.33−35 However, the computational aspect of this study focuses on the two
main general mechanisms for investigating the radical scavenging capabilities
of phenolics, the HAT and the SET.

The HAT and SET mechanisms
have been associated with the calculation
of two chemical properties: bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) and adiabatic
ionization potential (IP), respectively.36 The density functional theory (DFT) method has been used in the
evaluation of chemical properties because of its speed, ease, and
accuracy.37,38 Moreover, computationally determined BDE
and IP values have been reported to correlate well with experimentally
determined antioxidant parameters.39,40 Research efforts
in the use of the DFT method have revealed that the BDE and IP values
are significantly influenced by levels of theory and the type of solvent,
whereas basis sets do not play a significant role in BDE and IP calculations.41 Among the DFT functionals, the B3LYP functional
has been reported to show good performance in geometry optimization
and its quite accurate prediction of X–H bond energetic and
binding energies.23,42 The LC-ωPBE functional
has been successfully used in benchmarking the DFT method in probing
antioxidant-related properties.41 Although
gas-phase calculations on antioxidant activities have been carried
out on chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide,24,38 little is still known about the calculations of the antioxidant
activities of these compounds in the methanolic phase.

The intracellular
production of reactive oxygen species is associated
with many cellular events, including activation of enzymes such as
xanthine oxidase (XO).43 XO is a superoxide-producing
enzyme with more than 1300 amino acid residues. It is generally known
to have low specificity and can combine with other compounds and enzymes
to create reactive oxidants, as well as oxidize other substrates.
It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure,
cardiomyopathy in diabetes, and chronic wounds.44−46

This
study was done to evaluate the kinetics (experimental approach)
and mechanisms (theoretical approach) of radical scavenging activities
of two vegetables, V. amygdalina and C. olitorius, and also to evaluate the inhibition
potency (molecular docking) of the main phenolic compounds in these
two vegetables; luteolin-7-O-glucuronide and chlorogenic acid against
xanthine oxidase, an enzyme implicated in oxidative injury.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The main apparatus and reagents used include
a Life Science UV–visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter
DU 730), a rotary evaporator (Buchi rotavapor R-124), methanol, and
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).

The plant materials (leaves
of V. amygdalina and C. olitorius) were obtained from the local market
in Ilorin-Nigeria at their commercially marketable maturity and verified
in the Department of Plant Biology, University of Ilorin, with the
following Voucher numbers UILH/002/1022 and UILH/003/154, respectively.

Methods
Extraction
The leave samples were prepared, air dried
at room temperature, and pulverized.

Typically, 100 g of the
pulverized leaf material was macerated with 1.0 L of methanol for
5 days. The methanolic extract was then filtered using Whatman filter
paper and concentrated under vacuum at 40 °C using a rotary evaporator
(Buchi rotavapor R-124). Finally, the crude extract obtained was stored
in sample bottles at 4 °C prior to antioxidant examinations.

DPPH Calibration
A stock solution of 2.54 × 10–2 mM was prepared and serial dilutions were made to
obtain six (6) solutions with concentrations of 1.27 × 10–2, 6.35 × 10–3, 3.18 ×
10–3, 1.59 × 10–3, 7.95 ×
10–4, and 3.98 × 10–4 mM.
The absorbance of the various concentrations was measured at a wavelength
of 517 nm, being the wavelength of maximum absorbance using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Beckman coulter), subsequently generating a graph
of absorbance against concentration (calibration curve), where the
slope of the graph represents the molar absorptivity (ε) of
DPPH according to the Beer–Lambert law.

DPPH Scavenging Activity
The antioxidant potential
of the methanolic crude extracts was determined based on their ability
to scavenge the stable 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazl (DPPH) free radical
adopting the methods of Brand-Williams et al.,47 with modifications. Stock solutions of the extracts of V. amygdalina and C. olitorius were prepared to obtain a concentration of 1000 mg mL–1. Dilutions were made to obtain 0.50, 0.25, 0.125, 6.25 × 10–2, 3.13 × 10–2, 1.56 ×
10–2, 7.81 × 10–3, 3.91 ×
10–3, and 1.95 × 10–3 mg
mL–1 concentrations; 2 mL of each of the extracts
at different concentrations were mixed with 2 mL of methanol solution
of DPPH at a concentration of 0.0254 mM. The mixture was then vigorously
shaken and allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 30,
50, 70, and 90 min. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at
517 nm with a mixture of methanol and DPPH solution used as control.
The absorbance results were obtained in triplicate, and the average
values were used as the actual absorbance. The scavenging activity
of the DPPH radical can be expressed as inhibition percentage using
the following equation according to Brand-Williams et al.47 6  where AB is the
absorbance of the control (containing all reagents except the test
compound), and AS is the absorbance of
the test compound.

The IC50 value of the samples,
which is the concentration of a sample required to inhibit 50% of
the DPPH free radical, was calculated from the graph of percentage
inhibition against extract concentrations.

Kinetic Analysis
At different time intervals, the concentrations
of the DPPH radical in the extracts were calculated using the Beer–Lambert
law 7  Here, A is the
absorbance
of the mixtures at a certain concentration (c) in
mol dm–3, with a path length l (dm).
ε is the molar absorptivity of the DPPH radical.

The kinetics
of scavenging the free radical (in this case, DPPH) may be achieved
via two types of second-order rate equations(1) Integration method 8  Then an integrated form of this type
of second-order
reaction rate equation was applied to the experimental results for V. amygdalina and C. olitorius 9  where {DPPH}0 and {DPPH}t are
the DPPH concentrations at time zero and
any time “t”, respectively. A plot
of  against time gives a slope k2.

(2) Isolation
method: This may be applied
to the kinetics of scavenging the free radical, DPPH, by a pseudo-first-order
means. This method of obtaining the kinetics of antioxidant activity
was adapted from Espín et al.4 using
DPPH and antioxidant concentrations of the extracts 10  

The second-order rate constant (k2) was determined by having the concentration of the antioxidant,
{antioxidant}, to be in large excess compared to the concentration
of the radical compound {DPPH}. This forces the reaction to vary only
with the concentration of DPPH. 11   12  {antioxidant} is assumed to remain constant
throughout the reaction and can be modified to obtain different k1 values. The change in {DPPH} with time gives k1. Determination of k1 was repeated at different antioxidant concentrations for each of
the samples, and the mean gave the overall k1.

We can, therefore, infer that DPPH was depleted from
the medium
under pseudo-first-order conditions according to the following equation: 13  where {DPPH} is the radical concentration
at any time (t), {DPPH}0 is the radical
concentration at time zero, and k1 is
the pseudo-first-order rate constant. This rate constant (k1) is linearly dependent (according to eq 11) on the concentration
of the antioxidant, and from the slope of these plots, k2 was determined.

DFT Studies
The
structures of chlorogenic acid and
luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide used for the DFT studies were downloaded
from the repository of PubChem.48 In the
ground state, the parent molecules were optimized at the B3LYP level
of theory and with the 6-31G(d) basis set. Optimizations of the radicals
(neutral and cation) were done at B3LYP/6-31G(d), starting from the
optimized geometries of the parent molecules. A restricted approach
was used for the optimization of the parent molecules, whereas an
unrestricted open shell approach was adopted for the radicals. An
implicit method was used for the solvation, with IEFPCM as the solvation
model and methanol as the solvent. To characterize the geometries
of the parent molecules and radicals as true minima, the harmonic
vibrational frequency was calculated using both B3LYP/6-31G(d) and
LC-ωPBE/6-31G. BDE and IP in methanol were determined using eqs 14 and 15, respectively. These equations were adopted from eqs 1 and 2. 14   15  where Hrad is
the enthalpy of the radical generated by hydrogen atom abstraction; HH is the solvation enthalpy of the hydrogen
atom (taken from Bizarro et al.49). Ecr and Ep are the
electronic energies of the cation radical generated after electron
transfer and of the parent molecules, respectively. Note that the
zero point energy corrections have been included in the enthalpy (H) and electronic energy (E) calculations.
Furthermore, molecular descriptors such as the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), electrophilicity
(ω), electronegativity (χ), hardness (η), and softness
(S) were calculated at this level of theory and with
basis set (B3LYP/6-31G (d)/IEFPCM) to support the results. All calculations
were done using the Gaussian 09 program suite50 on the Lengau cluster machine, a high-performance computing resource
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Cape
Town, South Africa.

Molecular Docking Studies
The X-ray
crystal structure
of the hypoxanthine–xanthine oxidase complex (PDB ID: 3NRZ)43 was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb), and
that of the standard ligand, febuxostat, a known non-purine selective
inhibitor of xanthine oxidase,51 was downloaded
from the PubChem repository (Pubchem CID: 134018).48 Prior to the docking experiments, the PDB crystal structure
of the hypoxanthine–xanthine oxidase complex was edited to
remove water molecules and all cocrystallized initiators to obtain
the free xanthine oxidase used as the target molecule for the docking
experiment. Following this initial preparation of the target and the
compounds under study using the Discovery studio program,52 molecular docking analyses were successfully
performed with the AutoDock tools version 1.5.6 and AutoDock version
4.2.5.1 docking program.53 The targeted
docking of the two antioxidant compounds to the XO receptor as a target
using the reported43 binding sites (the
amino acid residues within and around the binding pockets of the hypoxanthine
and molybdopterin cofactor) in the hypoxanthine–xanthine oxidase
complex was performed to detect the native ligand-receptor conformations
in accordance with the AutoDock4 docking protocol.53 The LGA stochastic search method54 was implemented with the semi-empirical free-energy force field
scoring function used to represent the potential energy surface of
the ligand–protein interaction. A bounding simulation box was
defined around the binding site of the protein by considering a distance
of 3.0 Å away from the outermost atoms of the bound ligand in
each of the x-, y-, and z-directions. To validate the docking method, the docking
of hypoxanthine and febuxostat with the xanthine oxidase target was
performed until a best docked ligand conformation with root mean square
distance (RMSD) less than 1.50 Å was obtained.

Results and Discussion
Experimental
Results
DPPH Calibration
The calibration of the DPPH solution
is performed to generate a calibration curve, in which absorbance
at 517 nm is plotted against varying concentrations of DPPH, and the
slope, thereby, gives the molar absorptivity of DPPH (52.497). A linear
regression (r2 value) of 0.997 was obtained
from the curve.

Antioxidant Activity
The % inhibition
of DPPH by V. amygdalina and C. olitorius in Figure 1 shows
that both plants have good inhibition ability at the experimental
concentrations, although the inhibition ability of V. amygdalina is stronger than that of C. olitorius. However, C. olitorius has a lower IC50 value (1.15 × 10–2 μg mL–1) than V. amygdalina (2.95 × 10–2 μg mL–1) (Table 1); this
lower IC50 value of C. olitorius points to its higher potency (Figure 2).

Kinetics Analysis
The result of the second-order rate
constant (k2) of the free radical scavenging
activities of V. amygdalina and C. olitorius by the integration method is summarized
in Figure 3. This result
was obtained from a plot of  against time (t).

Figure 3 Variation of  with time for V. amygdalina (a) and C. olitorius (b) for determination
of the second-order rate constant.

The second-order rate constant, k2,
which is the slopes of the plots, was averaged to obtain an overall
second-order rate constant of the antioxidant activities of the two
plant extracts. An average k2 of 6.4503
and 3.0390 (mM)−1 min–1 were obtained
for V. amygdalina and C. olitorius, respectively. This observation of a
higher k2 in V. amygdalina led to the inference that V. amygdalina’s extract scavenges the DPPH radical faster than C.
olitorius’s extract at the same concentration.
It is worth noting that the second-order rate constants decrease with
the concentration in both plant extracts; this means that the DPPH
radical scavenging ability of the plant extracts decreases as the
concentration decreases and that the antioxidant activities of both
plant extracts against the DPPH radical become insignificant at concentrations
below 0.0625 mg mL–1.

The r2 values of the trend lines over
all concentrations were averaged to obtain the overall r2 values in both cases. The values are 0.9836 and 0.9911
for V. amygdalina and C. olitorius, respectively.

Using the isolation
method, different pseudo-first-order rate constants
(k1) were obtained according to eq 11, whose integrated form
leads to 16  Therefore, a plot of  against times (t) gave
a slope equal to −k1. The linear
relationship between k1 and the concentration
of the extracts (eq 12) allows us to obtain k2 from the slope
of their graphs. The second-order rate constants (k2) obtained from the pseudo-first-order rate constants
are 0.0152 and 0.0093 (mM)−1 min–1 for V. amygdalina and C. olitorius, respectively. The linear regression
coefficient (r2) of 0.9325 for V. amygdalina revealed that it is more favored in
the pseudo-first-order kinetics than C. olitorius with a regression coefficient of 0.7999. However, both plant extracts
follow second-order kinetics in scavenging the free radical because
their regression coefficients are higher (>0.95) using the second
order.

DFT Studies
The skeletal
structure of chlorogenic acid
contains one aromatic and one aliphatic ring with five OH groups,
whereas the luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide backbone consists of
two aromatic and one aliphatic ring with six OH groups (Figure 1). It is worth noting that
the O–H groups of carboxylic acids on both antioxidants are
not considered because they are in constant resonance with the (C=O)
group and may not be available for H abstraction.

The BDE and
IP values of O–H groups in the antioxidant species may serve
as parameters to predict the mechanism of scavenging free radicals
by antioxidants.55 The lowest value between
these two parameters indicates the preferred thermodynamic pathway
(mechanism) of scavenging the DPPH radical.

Comparing the BDE
and IP values (Table 2) reveals that the H-atom transfer (HAT)
mechanism is the more preferred mechanism by the two antioxidants
because BDE is lower than IP for both B3LYP/6-31G(d) and LC-ωPBE/6-31G(d)
levels of theory. Also, worthy of note is the relative performance
of the two DFT functionals employed (Table 2); the BDE and the IP values from the B3LYP
functional are lower than their corresponding values from the LC-ωPBE
functional. The lower IC50 value of C. olitorius (chlorogenic acid) (Table 1) indicates its better antioxidant property than V. amygdalina (luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide).
Furthermore, the aromatic O–H groups in both antioxidants have
lower BDE values than the aliphatic O–H groups with the terminal
aromatic O–H groups, 2bOH and 1cOH, having the lowest BDE value
for chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, respectively. The
decreased values of BDE for aromatic O–Hs may be associated
with the extra stability caused by both intramolecular hydrogen bonding
and delocalization of electrons of the aromatic rings, as reflected
in the HOMO and LUMO energy diagrams shown in Figure 4. Therefore, the antioxidant property of
these two compounds could be attributed to the net effect of the dissociation
of aromatic O–H groups with the terminal aromatic O–H
group having a more pronounced effect in each compound.

active radicals used for the DFT studies.

Despite having the same intramolecular hydrogen bond and being
terminal, it is observed from Table 1 that the 2bOH radical in chlorogenic acid has a slightly
lower BDE, and hence, it is more stable than the 2cOH radical in luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide.
This observation can be explained based on the stability of the OH
group adjacent to both 2bOH and 2cOH radicals. The OH group adjacent
to 2bOH in chlorogenic acid is more stable because it is conjugated
with an alkene group “meta” to it. This conjugation
gives an increased stability because electron delocalization does
not result in a pronounced perturbation of the benzene ring consisting
of the OHs. This is evident from Figure 5 as the HOMO of chlorogenic acid is distributed
on the terminal ring, whereas the HOMO of luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide
is distributed centrally, revealing its slightly lower antioxidant
activity compared to chlorogenic acid.

Figure 5 Distribution pattern
of the electron density of the molecular orbitals
in (a) chlorogenic acid and (b) luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide after
the DFT studies.

Due to its lower BDE
value in methanol, chlorogenic acid is more
active toward scavenging the DPPH radical via the HAT mechanism than
luteolin-7-glucuronide, regardless of the additional ring and hydroxyl
groups in the latter. The molecular descriptor values support this
claim (Table 3). The
energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO)
is lower in chlorogenic acid than that in luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide.
This reveals that chlorogenic acid requires less energy to scavenge
the DPPH radical compared to luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide. Other
descriptors such as electronegativity (χ), electrophilicity
(ω), hardness (η), and softness (S) support
this claim (Table 3). Lower electronegativity, hardness, and electrophilicity values
make chlorogenic acid a more favorable antioxidant. Furthermore, the
higher HOMO and softness values support this.

Molecular Docking
Molecular docking results showed
that the studied compounds interacted favorably with the target (xanthine
oxidase) via several nonbonded interactions, which were mainly hydrogen-bonding
and hydrophobic interactions. The docking results revealed that chlorogenic
acid and luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide formed stable complexes
with XO (Figure 6),
which showed that they interacted well with the active sites of XO.
The analyses of the binding affinities, which express the binding
free energies of these potential antioxidants, febuxostat, and the
control ligand, hypoxanthine, reported in Table 3, showed that chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide
have higher binding free energies than the control ligand. Chlorogenic
acid binds significantly with the target via conventional hydrogen-bonding
interactions with ALA 1079, SER 1080, GLU 802, and MET 1038; carbon–hydrogen
bonds with ARG 912; pi–alkyl interactions with ALA 1078; and
pi–sigma interactions with PHE 914. On the other hand, luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide
showed conventional hydrogen bonds with GLY 799, ARG 912, THR 1083,
GLN 1194, GLY 1260, MET 1038, and SER 1080; carbon–hydrogen
bonds and pi–alkyl interactions with ALA 1078; and pi–sulfur
interactions with MET 1038. The control ligand, hypoxanthine, interacted
via hydrogen bonds with ARG 880, THR 1010, and GLU 802; pi–pi
stacking with PHE 914; pi–alkyl interactions with ALA 1078,
ALA 1079, VAL 1011, and LEU 1014; and pi–pi T-shaped stacking
with PHE 914. Finally, the reference compound, febuxostat, which is
a known xanthine oxidase inhibitor, displays conventional hydrogen-bonding
interactions with PHE 798, ARG 912, ALA 1079, SER 1080, and GLN 1194;
carbon–hydrogen bonds with GLU 1261; alkyl interactions with
ALA 910, ALA 1078, and MET 1038; and pi–alkyl interactions
with MET 1038 and PHE 914. These results regarding hypoxanthine and
febuxostat are in agreement with those found in the literature.56 An increase in hydrophobicity has been reportedly
linked to an increase in stability.57,58 We observed
that the trio of chlorogenic acid, luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide,
and febuxostat, which have closely higher binding affinities than
hypoxanthine, interacted with amino acids ALA 1078, SER 1080, and
ARG 912. This shows that these three compounds all preferentially
bind to XO at the binding sites of its molybdopterin cofactor, MTE,
which acts as a catalyst for the enzymatic actions of XO. Thus, the
compounds will successfully inhibit XO by disrupting the catalytic
pathway for the activation of the XO enzymatic action of generating
superoxides. This can be attributed to the presence of more phenolic
rings in the trio, which further supports and explains the antioxidant
activity of chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide
against the therapeutic xanthine oxidase. The molecular interactions
of the studied compounds are depicted in Figure 6a–d.

Figure 6 Molecular interactions between (a) chlorogenic
acid, (b) luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide,
(c) febuxostat, and (d) hypoxanthine and the amino acid residues of
therapeutic xanthine oxidase.

This result indeed further supports and explains the antioxidant
activity of the methanolic extracts of C. olitorius and V. amygdalina.

Conclusions
The kinetics and mechanism of the antioxidant activities of two
popular vegetables (V. amygdalina and C. olitorius) have been analyzed using spectrophotometric,
DFT, and molecular docking methods. Methanolic extracts of the plant
leaves contain phenolic antioxidants as the major agent responsible
for their DPPH scavenging activities. Although both plants prefer
second-order kinetics in scavenging the DPPH radical, V. amygdalina is faster than C. olitorius in this process, as 0.0152 and 0.0093 (mM)−1 min–1 were obtained for V. amygdalina and C. olitorius, respectively. DFT
analysis revealed that the dominant phenolic acids in both plants
prefer the HAT mechanism in scavenging DPPH as compared to the SET
mechanism, based on a comparison of their BDE and IP values of the
hydroxyls, OHs. It is also evident from the DFT analysis that delocalization
of electrons plays a more important role in the stabilization of O–Hs
than the number of O–H groups or number of rings. In addition,
molecular docking studies showed that both chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide
form favorable interactions with the therapeutic target, xanthine
oxidase, with their antioxidant potency comparable to that of febuxostat,
a potent antioxidant drug used as the control.
