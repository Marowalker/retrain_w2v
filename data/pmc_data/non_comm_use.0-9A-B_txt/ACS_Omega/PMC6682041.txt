Symphyocladia
latiuscula (Harvey)
Yamada is a red alga with a myriad of bromophenols accompanied by
a diverse array of biological activities. The main purpose of the
present study was to characterize the anti-Alzheimer’s disease
activity of bromophenols from S. latiuscula via inhibition of cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), β-site
amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and glycogen
synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). The results of enzyme inhibition
assays demonstrated 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol (1), 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl ether (2), and bis-(2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl) ether (3) as potent inhibitors of aforementioned enzymes. Among the
tested bromophenols, 3 showed multifold higher inhibition
of all of the tested enzymes. Enzyme kinetics revealed different modes
of inhibition, and in silico molecular docking simulation demonstrated
the importance of the 7–OH group and bromine number for H-bond
and halogen-bond interactions, respectively. Similarly, 1–3 at 20 μM concentration showed more than
50% inhibition of self-induced Aβ25–35 aggregation.
These results suggest that bromophenols from S. latiuscula, especially highly brominated (3), may represent a
novel class of anti-Alzheimer’s disease drugs.

Introduction
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
disease
(AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), are major causes of death
worldwide and are characterized by a progressive loss of specific
neuronal cell populations due to the accumulation of aggregated proteins
within neurons. AD represents a degenerative brain disease that is
characterized by a decline in cognitive function, memory, and understanding.
Various structural and functional damages in specific regions of the
brain occur in AD, leading to a decline in neural connectivity within
those regions.1 Of the changes in the brain
that are associated with AD, the two main changes are β-amyloid
plaques, which are protein fragments that accumulate outside neurons
and contribute to cell death by interfering with neuron-to-neuron
communication at synapses, and tau tangles, clusters of abnormal tau
proteins inside neurons that block the transport of nutrients and
other essential molecules inside neurons.2 Researchers suggest that the brain change that occurs in AD may
begin approximately 20 years before the appearance of symptoms.3−5 No pharmacological treatments at present stop or slow the progression
of nerve damage that leads to AD, and the U.S. FDA-approved drugs
(donepezil, galantamine, memantine, rivastigmine, and memantine combined
with donepezil and tacrine) only temporarily improve symptoms by increasing
the amount of neurotransmitters in the brain. Similarly, as of 2012,
out of 244 drugs tested, only memantine passed the clinical trial
and received FDA approval. Therefore, the discovery of anti-AD candidates
is still challenging.

The marine biosphere is the richest source
of structurally diverse
and unique compounds and is known as a treasure house of natural bioactive
secondary metabolites. In recent years, red and brown algae have been
shown to contain diverse groups of secondary metabolites (especially
bromophenols and phlorotannins) with high therapeutic potentials.
Natural brominated compounds have been reported to exhibit a variety
of biological activities including antibacterial, antidiabetic, antifungal,
antiviral, antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and enzymatic
activity through protein kinase and acetylcholinesterase inhibition.6−10 There have been limited reports of natural bromophenols showing
anti-AD disease activity. So far, it has been proven difficult to
identify a selective, safe, and effective new drug from marine-derived
bromophenols. Due to the limited amount of bromophenols in marine
algae, immediate in vivo investigations have been hindered. However,
reports on semisynthetic and synthetic brominated compounds have been
increasing.11,12 The bioactivity of bromophenols
from marine sources, their structure modification via synthetic and
semisynthetic routes, and optimization of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
parameters to discover leads for drug development have become crucial
subjects of investigation. With the aim to discover anti-AD disease
treatment candidates from marine sources, we conducted the present
study on a red alga, Symphyocladia latiuscula (Harvey) Yamada.

S. latiuscula (Harvey) Yamada is
a marine red algal species with a high content of bromophenols,13 and is widely distributed in Korea, Japan, and
northern China. As constituents with a highly conserved biosynthetic
pathway, bromophenols from S. latiuscula typically contain at least one 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl
moiety linked with different groups (aconitic acids, diketopiperazines,
glutamines, pyrrolidin-2-ones, sulfoxides, sulfones, sulfates, and
ureas) and have been reported to exhibit aldose reductase inhibitory,14 antibacterial,15 anticancer,16 antifungal,17 antiviral,18 antidiabetic,19 antityrosinase,20 and free radical scavenging activities.21 The presence of a number of electron-donating
hydroxyl groups in the 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl moiety supports
the pronounced antioxidant effect of bromophenols from S. latiuscula.22,23 We previously isolated
three bromophenol derivatives from S. latiuscula and reported their antidiabetic19 and
antityrosinase20 activities. Recently, S. latiuscula-derived polyphenols showed a neuroprotective
effect by ameliorating streptozotocin-induced diabetic peripheral
neuropathy in rats.24 To the best of our
knowledge, there are no reports of anti-AD activity of bromophenols
from S. latiuscula. Therefore, we performed
the first investigation of the anti-AD activity of three 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl
derivatives from S. latiuscula via
inhibition of cholinesterases (ChEs), β-site amyloid precursor
protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β
(GSK-3β) and explored the inhibition mechanism by enzyme kinetics
and molecular docking simulation. In addition, their effect on self-induced
Aβ25–35 aggregation is also evaluated here.

Results
Inhibition
of Multiple Enzyme Targets by a MeOH Extract of S.
latiuscula and Isolated Bromophenols
The
anti-Alzheimer’s disease activities of a methanol extract
of S. latiuscula and three isolated
2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl derivatives (Figure 1) were evaluated via measuring AChE, BChE,
BACE1, and GSK-3β inhibition. Figure 2 shows the concentration-dependent inhibition
of enzymes by the MeOH extract and reference compounds. Table 1 shows the 50% inhibitory concentrations
of the extract, test compounds, and reference compounds. As shown
in Figure 2, the MeOH
extract inhibited BChE and BACE1 activity by comparable magnitudes,
which were greater than its inhibition of AChE and GSK-3β.

All of the
test compounds, 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol
(1), 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl ether
(2), and bis-(2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl) ether
(3) exhibited significant (p < 0.05)
inhibition on ChE and BACE1 activity (Table 1). Among them, 3, with an IC50 value of 2.66 ± 0.24 μM, was the most potent
AChE inhibitor, followed by 1 (IC50; 7.31
± 0.25 μM) and 2 (IC50; 9.61 ±
0.35 μM). To validate the assay result, berberine was used as
a reference compound, which had an IC50 value of 1.17 ±
0.09 μM. In BChE enzyme inhibition, all test compounds showed
superior activity to berberine (IC50; 26.15 ± 0.27
μM). Again, with the lowest IC50 value of 4.03 ±
0.15 μM, 3 dominated 1 (IC50; 8.95 ± 2.18μM) and 2 (IC50;
14.41 ± 0.27 μM) in BChE inhibition. Interestingly, the
BACE1 inhibition potential of tested bromophenols was 5–10-fold
higher than the reference drug, quercetin (IC50; 25.21
± 3.12 μM). Unlike AChE and BChE inhibition, the BACE1
inhibitory potential of 2 was greater than that of 1, but 3 dominated the others by 2-fold. Furthermore,
bromophenols showed mild to moderate inhibition of GSK-3β. Luteolin
and SB-415286 were used as natural and synthetic reference inhibitors
of GSK-3β to validate our result, which showed inhibition of
enzyme activity by 50% at 5.42 ± 0.19 and 0.11 ± 0.01 μM,
respectively. By inhibiting 50% of enzyme activity at 56.46 ±
2.48 μM, 3 showed moderate activity against GSK-3β.
However, 1 and 2 exhibited mild inhibition
of GSK-3β, with IC50 values of 229.42 ± 12.05
and 140.01 ± 15.08 μM, respectively. The dimer form of
(3) exhibited multifold higher activity than its monomer
(2) in all of the tested enzymes.

Enzyme Kinetics of Bromophenols
To explore enzyme inhibition
mechanisms, we analyzed the kinetics of the studied enzymes at different
substrate concentrations. Since all of the tested bromophenol derivatives
exhibited potent inhibition of AChE, BChE, and BACE1 activity, their
inhibition modes and the enzyme kinetic parameters were investigated
via Lineweaver–Burk plots and Dixon plots. Figures 3–5 and Table 2 show the results. Bromophenols 1–3 were mixed-type inhibitors of AChE and competitive inhibitors
of BChE enzymes, with Ki values of 0.58,
0.71, and 0.64 μM for AChE inhibition and 1.15, 0.51, and 0.37
μM for BChE inhibition, respectively. In the mixed type of enzyme
inhibition (Figure 3D–F), the plots of 1/V versus 1/[S] produced a family of straight lines with a common intercept
in the second quadrant, indicating an increased Km value and a decreased Vmax value. As shown in Figure 4D–F, the Lineweaver–Burk plots (1/V vs 1/[S]) revealed that all of the lines intersected
at the same point on the y-axis, suggesting that Km increased with increasing concentrations of 1–3, while 1/Vmax did not change. Similarly, the mode of BACE1 inhibition by 1 and 2 was noncompetitive (the Vmax value decreased in a concentration-dependent manner
without changing the Km value), with Ki values of 3.10 and 0.70 μM (Figure 5D,E). However, for 3, the inhibition mode was competitive, with a Ki value of 1.24 μM (Figure 5F).

Molecular Docking
Simulation of AChE Inhibition
Molecular
docking simulation was performed to elucidate the binding mode of
bromophenols 1–3 in the active gorge
of the Tetronarce californica AChE
enzyme (1acj), using AutoDock 4.2 (the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla,
CA). Figure 6 shows
the binding pattern of the respective bromophenols in the active site
cavity of an enzyme, and Table 3 shows the binding energies along with the interacting residues.
In Figure 6, the chemical
structures of compounds 1, 2, and 3 are shown in yellow, orange, and green colored sticks, respectively.
Similarly, H-bond and halogen contacts between 1–3 and enzyme residues are shown in blue and red lines, respectively.
As shown in Table 3, the reference catalytic inhibitor (tacrine) bound to the catalytic
active site of the AChE enzyme via the H-bond interaction with His440
and π–π interactions involving Phe330 and Trp84,
with a binding energy of −9.80 kcal/mol. Similarly, donepezil
(the reference allosteric inhibitor) bound to the peripheral active
site of the AChE enzyme through H-bond interactions with Phe288, Arg289,
and Asp72 (salt bridge) along with π–π interactions
involving Phe330, Trp279, and Trp84. Three test bromophenols were
involved in the interaction with His440 at the catalytic active site.
In particular, 1 and 3 showed the H-bond
interaction with His440 (Figure 6A,C), whereas 2 interacted with His440
via the Br–O bond (Figure 6B). In addition, 1–3 bound the peripheral anionic site through interactions involving
Tyr334, Asp72, Trp84, and Tyr121. Compared to the monomers (1 and 2), the dimer (3) displayed
more interactions with respect to the bromine number. Therefore, 1–3 showed mixed-type inhibition mode
binding to both the catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral active
site (PAS) of the AChE enzyme, with binding energies −7.47,
−7.37, and −10.9 kcal/mol, respectively.

with yellow, orange, and green colored sticks, respectively. The H-bond

Simulation of BChE Inhibition
To
study the inhibition mechanism of ligands inside the catalytic domain
of BChE, the chemical interactions of bromophenols 1–3 with the active site amino acid residues were investigated. Figure 7 shows the positions
of the ligands and the polar (blue dotted lines) and halogen-bond
(solid red lines) interactions between the ligands and the amino acids.
Similarly, Table 4 shows
the binding energies and interacting amino acid residues. Tacrine
was used as a reference catalytic inhibitor to validate the docking
results, which showed H-bond interaction with a π-system of
the ring (His438) of BChE. Bromophenols 1–3 showed catalytic inhibition of BChE with low binding energies
of −6.17, −6.44, and −9.80 kcal/mol, respectively.
Bromophenol 1 was involved in an H-bond interaction with
Pro285 and halogen-bond interactions with His438 (π–π
T-shaped), Trp231, Leu286, Phe329, and Gly116. At the same time, 2 displayed four H-bond interactions [His438, Ser198, and
Pro285(×2)], along with nonpolar interactions with Trp231, Ala199,
Val288, Leu286, and Phe329. Interestingly, 3, which had
the lowest binding energy among the tested bromophenols and the reference
compound, displayed multiple bond interactions with His438 (two H-bonds
and one nonpolar interaction) and Trp82 (three H-bonds and one nonpolar
interaction). Furthermore, 3 also had nonpolar interactions
with Ala328, Trp430, Phe329, and Gly116. Altogether, through interactions
with catalytic active site residues, 1–3 displayed competitive mode BChE enzyme inhibition.

Simulation of BACE1 Inhibition
To
gain a better understanding of the BACE1 enzyme inhibitory mechanism
in detail, the interactions of bromophenols 1–3 with the BACE1 structure were evaluated via molecular docking
simulation. Binding energies and interacting residues, which include
H-bond interactions and other interactions with bromine atoms, are
listed in Table 5 and
depicted in Figure 8. To validate the docking results, we employed 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone
as allosteric and 2-amino-3-{(1R)-1-cyclohexyl-2-[(cyclohexylcarbonyl)amino]ethyl}-6-phenoxyquinazolin-3-ium
(QUD) as catalytic reference inhibitors. As shown in the results,
with bridging of H-bond interacting residues (Ser10, Gly11, Thr232,
and Gln304) and other interactions involving bromine atoms (Arg307,
Pro308, Ala335, Glu339, Val336, and Ser10) denoted by red solid lines, 1–2 bound to the active allosteric site
of BACE1 with low energies (−6.59 and −5.98 kcal/mol,
respectively). However, these interacting residues are not involved
in the binding of 3 to the enzyme. Instead, the interaction
showed the involvement of the catalytic Asp dyad (Asp32–Asp228).
With the lowest binding energy among the test compounds (−8.79
kcal/mol), 3 displayed five H-bond interactions (Ser36,
Ile126 × 2, Gly230, and Asp228), as shown by blue dotted lines
in Figure 8C. In addition,
bromine atoms interacted with Ser36, Val69, Asp228, Trp76, and Tyr71.
The determining factors for competitive inhibition by 3 were the interactions with the catalytic Asp dyad (Asp32–Asp228),
Ser36, Ile126, and Gly230, which were not observed for 1 and 2.

Self-Induced Aβ25–35 Aggregation
Extracellular aggregation of Aβ peptide
is the major clinical
hallmark of AD and Aβ25–35 is produced in
aged brains from proteolytic cleavage of soluble racemized Aβ1–40 peptides. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of
bromophenols 1–3 on the self-induced
aggregation of Aβ25–35. As shown in Figure 9, 1–3 displayed concentration-dependent inhibition on amyloid
aggregation. At 20 μM concentration, 1–3 displayed more than 50% inhibition on amyloid aggregation.
Particularly, 1 showed higher activity (66.79% inhibition)
followed by 3 (58.49%) and 2 (56.69%) at
20 μM concentration. Curcumin was used as a reference drug that
inhibited aggregation by 52.40% at 10 μM.

Drug-likeness and ADME Prediction
In addition to good
efficacy, an acceptable ADME profile is of the utmost importance in
drug discovery. Therefore, we predicted the drug-like behavior and
ADME properties of bromophenols, and Table 6 lists the predictions. In the experiments, 1 showed nondrug-like behavior, whereas 2 and 3 showed mid-structure behavior according to the MDDR-like
rule,25 which characterizes a molecule
as drug-like, mid-structure, or nondrug-like on the basis of the numbers
of rings, rigid bonds, and rotatable bonds. Similarly, according to
Lipinski’s rule [any orally active drug can have no more than
one violation of H-bond donors (≤5), H-bond acceptors (≤10),
molecular weight (≤500 Da), and log P (≤5)],261 and 2 were suitable, but 3 was not.

Interestingly, the ADME predictions
of these bromophenols revealed
an excellent percentage of plasma protein binding: 100% for 3, 97.13% for 1, and 94.49% for 2, representing strong binding. Similarly, human intestinal absorption
was higher than 90% for all bromophenol derivatives, indicating good
absorption. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration values
([brain]/[blood]) ranged from 3.55 to 6.44%, indicating high absorption
by the central nervous system. In addition, the prediction of intestinal
permeability in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2)
and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells showed moderate permeability
for the tested bromophenols. The overall results of the prediction
provide insight for optimizing drug-like properties.

Discussion
Alzheimer’s disease drug development has proven to be unusually
difficult, as evidenced by the 99.6% failure rate from 2002 to 2012;27 despite continuous research, the success rate
has not increased. In a recent research framework, Khachaturian et
al.28 have conclusively summarized the
reasons for the poor performance in AD drug development, which include
inappropriate/wrong drug molecule, dose, target, study design, analytical
methods, outcome measures, stages of disease (too late or too early),
intolerability, disease model, and poor study conduct. Therefore,
AD drug discovery and development are crucial and challenging.

The exact pathogenesis of AD is still unknown. On the basis of
causative factors, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies
collectively have proposed five hypotheses, the cholinergic hypothesis,
the amyloid hypothesis, the tau hypothesis, the calcium hypothesis,
and isoprenoid change.29 Of these, the
cholinergic hypothesis is the most accepted because AD is accompanied
by degeneration in cholinergic neurotransmission in the CNS, and the
cholinergic deficit is a consistent finding in AD.30 In addition, research on the amyloid and tau hypotheses
is ongoing and the focus of much interest. Therefore, our attempt
to characterize bromophenol derivatives as inhibitors of ChE, BACE1,
and GSK-3β extends these rationales for neuronal drug discovery.

The process of drug discovery and development begins with pharmacophore
identification from natural sources or development through synthetic
and semisynthetic routes. As a treasure house of diverse functional
secondary metabolites, the marine biosphere has attracted much interest,
and investigation has reached a peak level as evidenced by frequent
publications. In particular, brown and red algae, which are rich in
bromophenols and phlorotannins, have attracted the attention of research
scientists due to their profound biological activities. To continue
our efforts to discover a novel class of anti-AD drugs from natural
sources, we designed this study. We found that all tested bromophenols
are potent inhibitors of ChEs and BACE1 and moderate inhibitors of
GSK-3β. Depending on the structure and the test enzyme, the
50% inhibitory concentration for bromophenols on each enzyme was significantly
different from each other with Duncan’s test at p < 0.05. All of the tested bromophenols are fully substituted
by different groups and highly brominated, and have a 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxy
unit in common. These bromophenols showed a potent inhibitory effect
toward ChEs and BACE1. The potency pattern of bromophenols toward
ChE inhibition (IC50 range: 2.6–14.4 μM) was 3 > 1 > 2, whereas for BACE1
(IC50 range: 2.3–5.1 μM) and GSK-3β
(IC50 range: 56.4–229.4 μM) inhibition, it
was 3 > 2 > 1. In particular,
toward
BChE and BACE1 inhibition, these bromophenols were more potent than
reference controls berberine and quercetin. It seems that bromines
at C2, C3, and C6, and hydroxyl groups at C4 and C5 are necessary
for inhibition and substituents at C1 determines the potency. However,
it cannot be concluded unless the study is carried out on a larger
number of derivatives with various numbers and positions of bromine
and hydroxyl groups in the phenol ring. The pattern of AChE, BChE,
BACE1, and GSK-3β inhibition by 1–3 in the present study was similar to the pattern of PTP1B
and α-glucosidase inhibition in our recent work,19 which varied with a substituent at C7. When
the C7–OH group of bromophenol 1 was substituted
with −OCH3 (as in 2), its activity
against AChE slightly decreased; however, BChE inhibition decreased
by almost half. Interestingly, replacement of the C7–OCH3 group of 2 with another 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxyl
methyl ether moiety, linked via an O-linkage to give the bis form
(3), enhanced its activity multifold. In BACE1 and GSK-3β
enzyme inhibition, bromophenol 2, with its C7–OCH3 group, showed better activity than bromophenol 1, with its C7–OH group. Again, 3 showed multifold
more potent activity than 1 and 2. Although
the number of test compounds is not sufficient to draw conclusions
about the structure–activity relationship, an increase in numbers
of phenol rings and bromines greatly enhanced the activity. Zhang
et al.31 reported a similar result with
PTP1B inhibition.

The binding mode of bromophenols (1–3) with AChE, BChE, and BACE1 was examined through
in silico studies
to explore the key residues involved in the bromophenol–enzyme
interaction. The active pocket of the AChE enzyme (AChE gorge) from Torpedo californica contains a pair of regions for
enzyme catalysis: the catalytic active site (CAS) at the bottom of
the gorge, 20 Å deep, comprising a catalytic triad (Ser200-His440-Glu327),
and a peripheral anionic site (PAS) at the upper part of the gorge,
comprising 14 highly conserved amino acid residues.32 For allosteric regulation of AChE, ACh should bind to the
PAS residues, which would lead to conformational changes in the active
center. Bromophenols 1–3 were stably
bound to the active site of the AChE enzyme, encompassing both the
CAS and PAS. In the CAS, bromophenols demonstrated H-bonding or halogen-bonding
with His440. In particular, 3 interacted with His440
via both H-bond and halogen-bond interactions and also displayed multiple
halogen bonds corresponding to the bromine number. In the PAS, the
primary interactions observed were via Phe330, Asp72, Tyr121, and
Trp84 for the tested bromophenols. The higher binding affinity compared
to the lowest binding energy of 3 might be attributed
to multiple bond interactions parallel to the bromine number. The
mixed-type inhibition mode of 1–3 can be explained by the bidirectional binding modes (CAS and PAS).
Similarly, the binding site of the hBChE protein is characterized
by an acyl pocket at the bottom of a deep catalytic gorge comprising
the oxyanion hole (Gly118, Gly119, and Ala201); the peripheral site
at the edge of the gorge; and the choline-binding site (Trp84) within
the gorge.33 Bromophenols 1–3 inhibited catalysis by forming H-bond interactions
with Pro285, His438, Trp82, and Asp70 at a bond distance of 1.8–2.8
Å. His438 is a member of a catalytic triad, and 1 and 2 showed single-bond interactions with this residue.
However, 3 interacted via multiple bonds, as shown in Figure 7. In addition, other
interactions with Trp82, Ala328, Val288, and Leu286 were observed
in the active catalytic site. This explains the lowest binding energy
and highest binding affinity of 3 at the active catalytic
site of an enzyme. Similarly, electrostatic interactions between 3 and the side chains of the catalytic aspartates (Asp32 and
Asp228) of BACE1 were observed via hydrogen and halogen bonds. However, 1 and 2 showed interactions with the allosteric
residues Ser10, Arg307, Ala335, Pro308, Glu339, and Gln304 of the
BACE1 enzyme without involving catalytic dyads. Thus, from the docking
result, 1 and 2 were characterized as noncompetitive
inhibitors and 3 as a competitive inhibitor of BACE1.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that aberrant regulation of
GSK-3 is involved in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases such
as AD, PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.34−37 In addition, GSK-3 likely activates a variety of immune response
targets, such as cyclic-AMP response element binding protein, toll-like
receptors, transcription factor NF-κB, and proteins involved
in cytokine production.38,39 Thus, inhibition of
hyperactivity of GSK-3 to a normal level emerges as a promising therapy
for the treatment of neurodegenerative and behavior disorders. A review
by Avrahami et al.40 stated that “Mild
inhibition of GSK-3 is favored because this decreases the exacerbated
GSK-3 function in the tissue affected with minimum deleterious effects
on healthy tissues.” The three bromophenol derivatives tested
in the present study showed mild to moderate inhibition of GSK-3β.
Therefore, these derivatives could be of additional benefit in treating
neurodegenerative disorders. However, how these compounds affect the
aforementioned signaling pathways is not known. Similarly, in the
amyloid aggregation assay, all of the tested bromophenols at 20 μM
concentration displayed prominent inhibition on self-induced Aβ25–35 peptide aggregation. Aβ25–35 represents the biologically active region of Aβ peptide because
it is the shortest fragment with large β-sheet aggregated structures
and retains the toxicity of the full-length peptide.41 Therefore, the inhibition of Aβ25–35 self-assembly contributes to the management of AD and highlights
rational drug design.

Halogen bonding has attracted much interest
recently due to its
important role in molecular recognition in biological systems. Voth
et al.42 showed halogen bonding to be a
stabilizing factor and a conformational determinant in protein–ligand
and DNA structures. Halogens facilitate the crossing of the BBB and
prolong the half-life of a drug molecule by filling hydrophobic cavities
in the binding sites.43,44 Therefore, these brominated phenols
might be of particular interest in the design and discovery of neuronal
drugs. In addition, we predicted several pharmacokinetic parameters
of 1–3. Although in silico ADME predictions cannot
fully replace well-established in vitro cell-based approaches or in
vivo assays, they can provide significant insights. The abilities
of the drug to reach the appropriate receptors in the target tissue,
and remain metabolically stable to exert the desired effect are important
criteria for drug development. For this, the drug must have excellent
plasma binding and BBB penetration. Our predictions of the ADME characteristics
of bromophenols 1–3 showed excellent
plasma binding (94.4–100%), human intestinal absorption (92.7–94.7%),
and BBB penetration (3.5–6.4%). These results provide evidence
of improved delivery to the CNS. Jitareanu et al.45 found a similar result: halogenation led to improvements
in membrane binding, permeation, and diffusion. Similarly, Gentry
et al.46 found that addition of bromine
and chlorine to peptide drugs significantly enhanced in vitro BBB
permeation, showing improved CNS delivery. Furthermore, a recent review
by Gribble,6 demonstrated superior antimicrobial,
anticancer, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity
for brominated compounds, highlighting their advantage in drug discovery.

In the present study, three 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl
derivatives (1–3) from S. latiuscula were characterized as potent inhibitors
of ChEs, BACE1, and GSK-3β, and emphasized the importance of
the 7–OH group and bromine number in ligand–enzyme interaction.
In addition, these bromophenols exhibited good inhibition of self-induced
Aβ25–35 aggregation. Overall, the results
of the present study show that these bromophenol derivatives could
be promising drug candidates against AD, and these compounds should
be tested in vivo for neuronal drug discovery, especially targeting
AD.

Cholinesterase
Enzyme Inhibition Assay
The potential
of bromophenols to inhibit ChE enzymes was determined following our
previously reported procedure.47 AChE and
BChE enzyme inhibition was evaluated using ACh and BCh substrates,
respectively. Bromophenols and positive control (berberine) were dissolved
in 10% analytical grade DMSO, and each enzymatic reaction was conducted
in triplicate in a 96-well microplate. Briefly, 140 μL of sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 20 μL of different concentrations
of bromophenols or berberine, and 20 μL of either AChE or BChE
solution (0.36 U/mL) were mixed and incubated at room temperature
for 15 min. Then the reaction was initiated by adding 10 μL
of DTNB and 10 μL of substrate (either AChI or BCh), and further
incubated at RT for 10 min. Finally, the hydrolysis of AChI or BCh
(formation of the yellow 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion) was monitored
at 412 nm using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). Percentage inhibition of ChEs was calculated as (1 – T/C) × 100, where T and C are the enzyme activities in the presence
or absence of inhibitors, respectively and are expressed as IC50 values calculated from the log dose–inhibition curve.

BACE1 Enzyme Inhibition Assay
The ability of bromophenols
to inhibit the BACE1 enzyme was evaluated in vitro using human recombinant
β-secretase and a BACE1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer
assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All of the experimental
conditions and procedures were similar to those in our previous report.48 In brief, 10 μL of assay buffer (pH 4.5),
10 μL of BACE1 (1.0 U/mL), 10 μL of the BACE1 substrate
(750 nM), and 10 μL of different bromophenols/quercetin concentrations
were mixed in 384-well back plates and incubated for 60 min at RT
in the dark. After incubation, mixtures in wells were irradiated at
545 nm and emission intensity at 585 nm was recorded using the SpectraMax
Gemini XPS microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). The percentage (%) inhibition of BACE1 activity was calculated
from the following equation: % inhibition = [1 – (S60 – S0)/(C60 – C0)] × 100%,
where S0 and C0 are the initial fluorescence of the test samples and control groups,
and S60 and C60 are the final (after 60 min) fluorescence of the test samples and
control groups, respectively, and are expressed as IC50 values calculated from the log dose–inhibition curve.

GSK-3β
Enzyme Inhibition Assay
The potential
of 1–3 to inhibit GSK-3β enzyme
activity was evaluated in vitro using hGSK-3β and a Kinase-Glo
reagent kit, following our previous report with some modifications.49 Test samples were prepared by serial dilution
in assay buffer (pH 7.5) (concentration of DMSO in the final reaction
mixture did not exceed 5%). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by
mixing 5 μL of a sample, 5 μL of ATP (1 μM final
concentration), 5 μL of 50 μM GSM, and 5 μL of 20
ng GSK-3β per well in a 384-well black plate, and incubated
at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, 20 μL of Kinase-Glo
reagent was added into each well to terminate the reaction and glow-type
luminescence was recorded in the Synergy HTX multi-mode microplate
reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The method was validated
using luteolin and 3-[(3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-amino]-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-1H-pyrrol-2,5-dione
(SB-415286) as reference compounds having maximum inhibition, and
the maximum enzyme activity was achieved in the absence of inhibitors
(5 μL of sample replaced by 5 μL of buffer).

Enzyme Kinetics
The kinetic study of AChE inhibition
by bromophenol 1 (1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM), 2 (2.5, 5, and 10 μM), and 3 (0.5, 1 and 5 μM)
was performed with the assay method in Section
2.3 in the presence of varying concentrations of the ACh substrate
(0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 nM). For BChE enzyme kinetics, bromophenols 1 and 2 were tested at the same concentrations
as for the AChE kinetics study, and 3 was tested at 1.25,
2.5, and 5 μM with BCh substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.3,
and 0.6 nM. Similarly, bromophenols 1 (1.25, 2.5, and
5 μM), 2 (1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM) and 3 (0.625 and 1.25) were tested with different substrate concentrations
(250, 375, and 750 nM) following an assay method for BACE1 enzyme
inhibition. Lineweaver–Burk plots were derived from the double
reciprocal plots of enzyme kinetic data. Ki values were calculated from the Dixon plots.

Docking Studies
Molecular docking analysis was carried
out using AutoDock 4.2.50 X-ray crystallography
of AChE–tacrine (PDB ID: 1ACJ),32 BChE–tacrine
(PDB ID: 4BDS),51 and BACE1–QUD (PDB ID: 2WJO)52 complexes were obtained from the Research Collaboratory
for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank website (http://www.rcsb.org/) at resolutions
of 2.80, 2.10, and 2.50 Å, respectively. Rotatable bonds in the
inhibitors and positive controls were assigned by AutoDockTools. The
3D structures of compounds 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol
(1), 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl ether
(2), and bis-(2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl) ether
(3) were constructed using Chem3D Pro (v12.0, CambridgeSoft
Inc., Cambridge, MA) and adjusted to pH 7 using MarvinSketch (ChemAxon,
Budapest, Hungary). Three-dimensional structures of 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone
and donepezil were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information PubChem, with the respective compound identification numbers
of 97332 and 3152. A molecular mechanics 2 force field was used to
minimize the energy of each ligand. AutoDock 4.2 was used for docking
simulations and AutoGrid was used to generate grid maps (catalytic
sites and allosteric sites). The docking protocol for rigid and flexible
ligand docking comprised 15 independent genetic algorithms. Docking
results were analyzed and visualized using UCSF Chimera (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).

Self-Induced Aβ25–35 Aggregation Inhibition
Assay
Bromophenols 1–3 were
accessed for their ability to inhibit self-induced Aβ25–35 aggregations via the thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence method,53 with slight modifications.54 In brief, Aβ25–35, lyophilized
from 1mg/mL hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) solution, was dissolved in
65% acetonitrile to obtain 0.4 mM stock solution. Then the stock solution
of Aβ25–35 was diluted by 2-fold in 69 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). To 72.5 μL of the amyloid solution,
2.5 μL of different concentrations of 1–3 (0.2, 2, and 20 μM) and/or curcumin (10 μM)
was added. After 24 h of incubation at 4 °C, 675 μL of
a 25 μM thioflavin T in 50 mM glycine–NaOH buffer (pH
8.5) was added and after 5 min the fluorescence emission at 490 nm
(ex = 446 nm) was measured by the SpectraMax Gemini XPS microplate
spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The fluorescence
intensities were compared and the percent inhibition due to the presence
of the inhibitor was calculated by the following formula: 100 –
(Fi/Fc ×
100), where Fi and Fc were the fluorescence intensities obtained for Aβ25–35 in the presence and in the absence of inhibitors,
respectively.

Drug-likeness and ADME Prediction
Drug-likeness and
ADME predictions were carried out using PreADMET (v2.0, YONSEI University,
Seoul, Korea).

Statistical Analysis
All of the
results are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments
and one-way analysis of variance and Duncan’s test (v23.0,
Systat Inc., Evanston, IL) were used to calculate the statistical
significance. A p-value <0.05 was considered to
be significant.
