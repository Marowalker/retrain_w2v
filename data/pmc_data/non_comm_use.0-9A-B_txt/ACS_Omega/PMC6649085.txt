In Figure 2, we were misled
by the wrong naming of images
during the SEM experiment, which caused us to present incorrect images
in panels g and h. Because the morphology of all samples observed
by SEM imaging was the same, replacement of panels g and h does not
impact the main conclusions of the paper. However, it is important
to show the presence of larger particles in SEM images when high-molecular
weight hyaluronic acid was used for the formation of the particles.
Particle size values, measured by dynamic light scattering, are presented
in Figure 2a, and therefore,
interpretations related to the size distribution remain valid even
after replacement of the aforementioned images in the corrected Figure 2.

Figure 2 Physicochemical characterization
of the HA particles prepared by
HA polymers with different MWs. LMW, MMW, and HMW denote the particles
prepared with low-, middle-, and high-MW HA, respectively. (a) Size
and ζ potential of the HA particles. (b) FTIR spectra of HA
particles, indicating bands at 1602 cm–1 for −COOH
groups of the HA and at 1030 cm–1 for S–O
and C–S stretching frequencies of DVS. (c) TGA of the HA particles.
(d) Size–pH correlation of the HA particles. (e) ζ potential
of the particles under different pH conditions in a 0.01 M KCl solution.
The pH was adjusted using 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M HCl. (f–h) SEM
images of the HA particles prepared with low-, middle-, and high-MW
HA polymers, respectively. Scale bars are 2 μm.
