Mesoporous NiO films were deposited
by means of a screen printing
technique onto fluorine-doped tin oxide transparent electrodes and
consequently sensitized with Erythrosin B (EryB) dye. The obtained
colored NiO material was used as a working electrode in a three-electrode
cell to study the evolution of the triple semiconductor/dye/electrolyte
interface upon electrochemical polarization in dark conditions. The
electrolyte was a solution of I3–/I– in acetonitrile, with the redox couple representing
the typical redox shuttle of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The
adopted electrochemical conditions were devised in order to simulate
the actual electrical environment of the NiO/dye photocathode in a
light-soaked DSC. The use of a benchmark sensitizer EryB and of the
most widely used redox mediator I3–/I– is particularly meaningful for the study of the adsorption
dynamics and the determination of possible degradative phenomena on
the basis of the behavior of numerous analogue systems. Therefore,
for the first time, the evolution of the NiO/EryB/I3–/I– multiple interface was investigated
combining the electrochemical characterization with ex situ spectroscopic
analysis by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The resulting
picture shows that EryB in the immobilized state promotes the redox
processes based on the I3–/I– couple. Moreover, the EryB sensitizer inhibits the phenomena of
recombination between the metal oxide semiconductor and the redox
couple.

Introduction
Nickel oxide (NiO)
in the configuration of a thin film constitutes
a material of great interest for its involvement as the active component
in a variety of advanced applications. These include the electrochemical
storage of energy,1 the modulation of optical
transmission via electrical signals in electrochromic windows,2 the photoelectrochemical conversion of the luminous
radiation into electrical energy3,4 or chemicals/fuels,5,6 and the conversion of optical signals into electrical signals in
optoelectronic devices.7 In particular,
NiO thin films with nanostructured morphology8 are widely used in photoelectrochemical cells because NiO represents
the benchmark photocathodic material of p-type dye-sensitized solar
cells (p-DSCs).9−13 In the context of the DSC application14,15 the photoelectrochemical
properties of mesoporous NiO electrodes in the bare state are not
sufficiently good to realize an efficient process of photoactivated
electroreduction.16 Therefore, NiO necessitates
a sensitizer17 with opportune structural,
optical, and excited-state properties18−20 to realize efficaciously
the conversion of an optically generated exciton21 into two separated charged species of opposite signs and
with high mobility.22 The successive diffusion
of the photogenerated charge carriers toward the respective charge
collectors represents the main mechanism with which the photocurrent
is transported through a DSC.23 In NiO-based
p-DSCs, the optical excitation of the colorant leads to the simultaneous
injection of a hole into the valence band (VB) of mesoporous NiO and
the transfer of an electron to the oxidized (Ox) form of the redox
shuttle24 (Scheme 1), the redox couple I3–/I– being the most common choice of the redox mediator
for DSCs.25

Scheme 1 Energy Level Scheme
and Mechanism of Dye-Mediated Electron Transfer
(ET) from the VB of a p-Type SC to the Ox Form of a Redox Shuttle
with E0,r > Ev
The dye sensitizer mediates the
ET process via photoinduced excitation of an electron from the HOMO
to the LUMO level of the dye (ELUMO – EHOMO = hν2). The dye in the transient excited state has a sufficiently high
electronic energy to transfer an electron to Ox at the equilibrium
energy E0,r because ELUMO > E0,r. The final
chemical
product of the photoactivated ET process is the reduced form (red)
of the redox shuttle.

A recent study on the
ex situ characterization of DSC electrodes
with X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques showed that sensitized photocathodes
of mesoporous NiO undergo structural reconstruction under the operative
conditions of a p-DSC and a tandem DSC (t-DSC).26 Such a structural modification of NiO is a consequence
of charge photoinjection in the metal oxide when I3–/I– is the redox shuttle. The observed
phenomenon is specific of mesoporous p-type NiO,27 whereas n-type photoanodes such as TiO226,28 or ZnO29 do not present alterations of
the XRD spectra following their photoelectrochemical action toward
the I3–/I– couple in
DSCs. XPS studies combined with electrochemical analyses also revealed
that mesoporous NiO electrodes in both bare30 and sensitized31 versions possess defective
surface sites that are electroactive in dark conditions11,32 and, in the case of the nonsensitized NiO electrode, represent the
preferred sites of ionic adsorption, as well as the actual reaction
sites of the dark oxidation of I– into I3–.33,34 It is expected that the modification
of the surface properties of NiO following its sensitization with
a colorant will bring about changes in the adsorption properties,35 as well as in the mechanisms of charge transfer,
charge compensation, and eventual dye desorption31 with respect to the bare metal oxide, especially when sensitized
NiO is electrochemically polarized in an electrolyte containing a
redox couple. In this framework, a further progress on the understanding
of the adsorption/electrochemical phenomena occurring at a modified
NiO electrode can be obtained by the combined spectroscopic analysis
of the surface of sensitized NiO and the determination of its electrochemical
properties when the sensitized electrode is electrochemically polarized
in the presence of redox species. To our knowledge, at present, no
spectroscopic analyses of sensitized mesoporous NiO have been reported
when the reference redox couple I3–/I– is present in the electrolyte and sensitized NiO undergoes
a treatment of electrochemical oxidation in dark conditions. For the
realization of this type of study, we have considered the sensitization
of nanostructured NiO electrodes with the Erythrosin B (EryB) dye36,37 that represents the commercial benchmark of NiO sensitizers for
p-DSC purposes and the application of a highly surface- and chemical
environment-sensitive technique, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS).

Experimental Section
Preparation of the NiO Film and Sensitization
with the Dye
NiO thin films with mesoscopic features (see Figure S1) were deposited onto fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO)-coated
glass specimens via screen-printing according to the procedure reported
in refs.38−40 The screen-printed electrodes
were sensitized via dipping in a 0.2 mM solution of EryB in ethanol
for 16 h. The dye molecules which were not chemisorbed on the electrode
were removed by rinsing the electrode with pure ethanol after the
step of sensitization. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
or Fluka at the highest degree of purity available and were used without
any further purification.

Electrochemical Characterization of NiO Electrodes
The electrochemical properties of EryB-sensitized NiO thin films
were studied with a three-electrode cell configuration: NiO/EryB-covered
FTO was used as a working electrode, a Pt wire was used as a counter
electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as a reference electrode. The electrolyte
used was a mixture of 1 M LiI and 0.1 M I2 in acetonitrile
(ACN).

The applied potential values here reported are all referred
to the Ag/AgCl electrode (EAg/AgCl vs
normal hydrogen electrode = 0.21 V). The NiO films that did not undergo
any electrochemical treatment were taken as reference samples in order
to analyze with XPS the nature of spontaneous adsorption phenomena.
Reference samples were of two types: (a) freshly sensitized NiO films
(here indicated as NiO/EryB samples) and (b) EryB-sensitized NiO films
dipped in the electrolytic solution 1 M/0.1 M LiI/I2 in
ACN and successively rinsed in pure ACN (here denominated NiO/EryB/sol
samples). The reference NiO/EryB/sol samples for XPS analysis reproduce
the cathode of the p-DSC in dark conditions and at open circuit, that
is, with no photovoltage and null photocurrent. The freshly prepared
NiO/EryB samples underwent the following electrochemical treatments:
(i) 1 scan and successive 50 continuous scans of cyclic voltammetry
at the rate of 0.02 V s–1 within the potential range
−0.27 ≤ E ≤ 1.13 V versus Ag/AgCl,
with the initial and the end potentials corresponding to the open-circuit
potential (OCV) of the cell. The reference samples labeled with CV
1 and CV 50 indicate the electrode after 1 voltammetric scan and 50
voltammetric cycles, respectively. (ii) Chronoamperometry at Eappl = 0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl with the recording
of current for a duration of 8000 s (the sample undergoing the oxidative
potential step is labeled as Ox). The choice of this value of potential
is motivated by the fact that it corresponds to the electrical potential
at which the second oxidation wave of pristine NiO occurs (vide infra).41−46 (iii) One voltammetric scan (1 cycle) at the rate of 0.02 V s–1 with the applied potential going from OCV to 1.13
V and back-reversed to −0.27 V versus Ag/AgCl. After the scan,
the potential of the electrode was kept at a final value of −0.27
V for 8000 s. The thereby obtained sample is denominated here as Red.
After the electrochemical treatments, all samples were rinsed with
pure ACN and dried with a stream of nitrogen. In the following text,
all potential values will be referred to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric curves were recorded with
the potentiostat/galvanostat Autolab PGSTAT 128N and analyzed with
the software NOVA 1.9.

All the samples were mounted onto the
XPS sample holder with an
adhesive scotch tape and a drop of silver paste to ensure electrical
contact. The sample was uploaded in the XPS lock chamber as quick
as possible to avoid eventual surface contamination from the ambient
atmosphere.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS measurements were
performed with a modified Omicron NanoTechnology MXPS system equipped
with a dual X-ray anode (Omicron DAR 400) and an Omicron EA-127 7-channeltron
energy analyzer. XP spectra were acquired using Mg Kα photons
(hν = 1253.6 eV) as the excitation source,
generated with the anode operating at 14 kV and 14 mA. No charging
was experienced during measurements. For all the samples, the spectral
regions associated with the ionization of Ni 2p, I 3d, I 4d, O 1s,
and C 1s levels were acquired using an analyzer pass energy of 20
eV. A survey scan at 50 eV of pass energy was also taken. A take-off
angle (θ) of 21° with respect to the direction normal to
the surface was considered. The measurements were performed at room
temperature, and the base pressure in the analyzer chamber was about
2 × 10–9 mbar during the recording of the spectra.
The binding energy (BE) of the Ni 2p3/2 peak at 854.0 eV,
associated with the cd9L final state
configuration in NiO,30 was used as an
internal standard reference for scaling the BE (accuracy of ±0.05
eV). The experimental spectra were theoretically reconstructed by
fitting the secondary electron background to a linear or a Shirley
function (subtracted from the experimental spectrum after optimization)
and to elastic peaks with symmetric pseudo-Voigt functions described
by a common set of parameters [position, full width at half-maximum
(FWHM), and Gaussian–Lorentzian ratio] free to vary within
narrow limits. The Gaussian–Lorentzian ratio varied between
0.7 and 0.8. XPS atomic ratios between relevant element components
was estimated from experimentally determined area ratios (with ±10%
as associated error), which were corrected for the corresponding photoelectron
cross sections according to Scofield calculations47 and for the square root dependence of the photoelectron
kinetic energy.

Electron Microscopy
Morphological
investigation of
NiO thin films was performed using a field-emission scanning electron
microscope Zeiss Auriga 405 (c/o SNN-Lab-Sapienza Nanoscience &
Nanotechnology Lab).

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical Characterization
of NiO/EryB Electrodes
The electrical potential of EryB-sensitized
NiO and bare NiO was
cycled in the range −0.27 ≤ E ≤
1.13 V, and the corresponding variations of current were recorded
and are shown in the voltammograms of Figure 1 when the electrolyte was 1 M LiI/0.1 M I2 in ACN. The voltammograms presented in Figure 1 refer to the 1st and the 50th cycle of EryB-sensitized
NiO (blue and red profiles) and to the 1st voltammetric cycle of bare
NiO (dark green curve). The onset of current is the same for all three
voltammograms (ca. 0.25 V) and refers to the two-electron oxidation
of iodide according to33 1  

Figure 1 Voltammograms
of EryB-sensitized NiO and bare NiO in the electrolyte
1 M LiI/0.1 M I2 in ACN. The scan rate was 20 mV s–1.

The shape of the three
voltammograms is typical of an irreversible
electrochemical process that is originated by the redox active species
adsorbed and immobilized on the electrode surface.48,49 The electrochemical oxidation of iodide follows the first oxidation
of the NiO electrode (either in the bare or in the sensitized state),
which involves a much lower amount of current with respect to iodide
oxidation.33,34 For this reason, such a NiO-based
electrochemical process is barely detectable in the full current scale
of the voltammograms that refer to the oxidation of iodine at NiO
electrodes.33 In addition to that, oxidation
of iodide overlaps with the second process of NiO oxidation because
both processes occur in the same range of electrical potential.33,34 The electrical current originated by the second oxidation of NiO
(either in the bare or in the sensitized state) is considerably smaller
than the current of iodide oxidation and thus cannot be evidenced
in the voltammogram of Figure 1.33,34 When the 1st voltammetric cycles of bare
and EryB-sensitized NiO are compared (Figure 1, dark green and blue traces, respectively),
the current generated at the EryB-sensitized electrode is larger than
the one generated at bare NiO. This result could be a consequence
of several concomitant causes: (i) the rate of electron transfer (et)
between iodide and NiO is larger when EryB sensitizes NiO, with respect
to the bare oxide (this would imply an electrocatalytic effect of
EryB); (ii) the amount of adsorbed iodide, that is, the redox active
species, is higher when NiO is sensitized by EryB compared to the
bare oxide (the effect of surface concentration, which is exerted
by immobilized EryB); (iii) the iodine atoms present in the EryB molecule
(Figure 2) are somehow
involved as initiators/mediators of iodide oxidation onto NiO (the
catalytic effect of EryB).

Figure 2 Molecular structure of the EryB sensitizer.

It is well established that the
EryB sensitizer acts as a passivating
agent of mesoporous NiO, as far as the electrochemical oxidation of
NiO is concerned, when no redox species are present in the electrolyte.11 In these conditions, the occurrence of the electrochemical
oxidation of NiO implies the uptake of charge compensating anions
that get either adsorbed on the oxide surface or intercalated within
the structure of oxidized  NiO. The presence of a (mono)layer
of immobilized EryB, then, disfavors the process of charge compensation
in oxidized  NiO because its presence would prevent intercalation
phenomena in NiO with the EryB layer acting as a blocking agent. The
uniform presence of surface localized EryB molecules was deduced from
the attenuation of the typical voltammetric oxidation peaks of NiO
upon loading of EryB onto the electrode surface.50 Such uniformly distributed EryB layer does not allow the
formation of the ionic couples generated upon direct contact of positively
charged sites of oxidized  NiO with the anions from the electrolyte.
It is known that immobilized EryB does not possess any electrochemical
activity in correspondence of the potential range within which the
NiO substrate oxidizes.11 These electrochemical
characteristics of the EryB-sensitized NiO lead us to exclude the
existence of an important electrocatalytic effect of immobilized EryB
when iodide is oxidized  at sensitized NiO [cause (i), vide supra].
In fact, the possible electrocatalytic effect of immobilized EryB
would have manifested itself through the occurrence of charge-transfer
processes between the EryB sensitizer and oxidized  NiO, with
the detection of either an increase of NiO oxidation current on passing
from bare to the EryB-sensitized state or EryB-based redox processes
also in absence of a redox species (like iodide) in the electrolyte.
Under these circumstances, hypotheses (ii) and (iii) represent the
most probable causes at the basis of the increase of anodic current
for the electrochemical oxidation of iodide on passing from bare to
EryB-sensitized NiO. In particular, it is expected that the adsorption
of iodide and the desorption of triiodide (the product of I– oxidation) are the main factors that control the electrochemical
behavior of EryB-sensitized NiO in presence of redox species. The
continuous electrochemical cycling of EryB-sensitized NiO in the iodine/iodide
electrolyte brings about a drop of iodide oxidation current (Figure 1, comparison of blue
and red profiles). This evolution of the NiO/EryB voltammograms can
be due to several reasons, such as the partial detachment of the EryB
layer31 or the progressive passivation
of the NiO/EryB surface against further iodide oxidation because of
the irreversible immobilization of triiodide, that is, the product
of iodide oxidation, on the surface of NiO/EryB. From the analysis
of the XPS data (vide infra), it results that continuous cycling of
the NiO/EryB electrode in the range of iodide oxidation leads to the
increase of triiodide concentration, likely due to triiodide molecules
that remained trapped at the surface of NiO/EryB after their formation.
The onset of potential for the oxidation of iodide shifts to higher
values (from 0.4 to 0.6 V) when the electrode undergoes multiple cycles:
this is because an increasing number of oxidizing Ni(III) sites remains
localized at the oxide surface even upon reversal of the potential
scan. The electrochemically formed Ni(III) states are not reversibly
reduced to Ni(II) because of the strong adsorption of triiodide on
NiO/EryB and the built-up of stable ionic couples Ni(III)/I3–. These features will be further analyzed in more
detail in the XPS section (vide infra).

The oxidative polarization
of NiO/EryB at 0.9 V was carried out,
and the chronoamperometric curve has been recorded during the first
8000 s of the potentiostatic experiment (Figure 3) to check which iodine-based species are
adsorbed on the surface of the EryB-modified NiO electrode. In the
case of bare NiO, it has been previously found that I– adsorbs onto the NiO surface prior to the occurrence of its oxidation.33 Once iodide is transformed into triiodide, the
product of oxidation I3– does not easily
desorb from the electrode surface of bare NiO.

Figure 3 Chronoamperometric curve
of the cell with the NiO/EryB working
electrode when the potential of polarization is 0.9 V. Electrolyte
composition: 1 M LiI/0.1 M I2 in ACN. This potentiostatic
experiment served for the preparation of the Ox sample.

At the starting point t = 0, the
current density
is 8 mA cm–2 in accordance with the value recorded
in the first voltammetric cycles. Then the current density rises till
it reaches a first plateau at ca. 500 s. This is ascribed to the process
of Ni(III) formation that initiates the oxidation of iodide. At t > 500 s, a further increase of current density is recorded
for the occurrence of iodide oxidation at the inner layers of the
porous electrode with the second maximum of current at ca. 1400 s.
The steady decline of current at t > 1800 s is
ascribed
to the saturation of the surface sites on which iodide oxidation occurs
because of the strong adsorption of the product of oxidation I3– on the electrode surface. After oxidation,
the NiO/EryB electrode was then polarized at −0.2 V, and the
chronoamperometric curve was recorded during the first 8000 s of the
potentiostatic experiment (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Chronoamperometric curve of the cell with the NiO/EryB
working
electrode when the potential of polarization is −0.2 V. Electrolyte
composition: 1 M LiI/0.1 M I2 in ACN. This potentiostatic
experiment served for the preparation of the Red sample.

The values of current density recorded during the
potentiostatic
experiment of Red sample preparation are much lower than in the experiment
of oxidative polarization. In these conditions, the desorption of
unreacted iodide and triiodide is the sole process that can occur
at the negatively polarized electrode of EryB/NiO, in accordance with
the voltammograms of Figure 1. At this cathodic polarization, the iodide anions that adsorbed
spontaneously onto the native and electrochemically generated defects
of NiO/EryB get desorbed completely from the sensitized surface of
NiO (vide infra XPS analysis). Different from bare NiO, the presence
of the EryB dye prevents the irreversible adsorption of iodine-based
species when the NiO/EryB electrode is polarized cathodically after
the oxidation step. The modest variations of the current upon cathodic
polarization of previously oxidized NiO/EryB reveal that no reduction
of Ni(III) takes place (in absence of the reverse redox process).
In conclusion, the cathodic polarization of oxidized NiO/EryB at −0.2
V produces only an electrostatic effect of anion desorption that is
completed after 500 s of polarization (Figure 4), but it does not provoke the redox/faradic
process of Ni(III) reduction (vide infra).

XPS Analysis of NiO/EryB
Electrodes
XPS was used in
order to investigate the possible interaction between the different
iodinated molecular species adsorbed onto the NiO porous thin films,
such as the EryB dye and the redox mediator couple I3–/I–, and to ascertain the effect
exerted on their relative concentrations by the application of different
electrochemical treatments. Such treatments were devised so as to
simulate possible real conditions during operation within a real p-DSC.
To these aims, the XPS technique is the most suitable mean because
it enables a fine and surface-sensitive investigation of chemical
environment and oxidation state. On the other hand, XPS was used as
an ex situ technique, resulting in a precious and irreplaceable mean
to approach the comprehension of the studied phenomena. The most relevant
photoionization regions reported in this work are those related to
the iodine atoms of the EryB dye and the redox couple, in particular
the I 4d and I 3d regions, and those associated with the NiO substrate,
that is, the Ni 2p region.

As an informative sketch of the elemental
fingerprints present in the sample, Figure 5 reports a survey spectrum of the NiO/EryB/sol
sample, taken as representative of the systems addressed in this work.
Signals from the substrate, the adsorbed dye, and the redox couple
can be identified, together with minor contributions from Sn because
of possible microscopic scratches exposing the underneath surface
of the FTO glass substrate to the X-ray beam.

Figure 5 Survey XP spectrum of
the NiO/EryB/sol sample. The most relevant
signals are identified.

I 4d
Hereafter, the XP spectra derived from the ionization
of the I 4d orbital within the different samples are commented. Even
if its photoionization cross section is lower than the I 3d orbital
one, the I 4d spectrum is far more commented in the literature of
iodine compounds, probably due to the propensity of the I 4d orbital
to be characterized under shape-resonance conditions51 and its higher sensitivity to changes in the chemical environment,
which make it a more reliable probe of the chemical state than the
I 3d level.33,52−55 Recently, we reported and commented
on the I 4d spectral features related both to the I3–/I– redox couple contacted to bare
unsensitized NiO33 and to EryB-sensitized
NiO immersed in an inert electrolyte.31 Therefore, we aim here at extending and implementing this highly
chemically sensitive approach to the understanding of the basic mechanisms
of the evolution of the semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interface upon
conditions, which match as close as possible those of a real DSC under
operation.

Figure 6 shows the I 4d XPS region of the NiO/EryB/sol sample, taken as the
prototypical example of the unreacted pristine system, simply obtained
from dipping the sensitized NiO film into the electrolyte solution.
For the sake of a clearer comprehension of the forthcoming spectra,
the various components used to reconstruct the experimental data are
here described. All the iodinated species present in the system are
found to contribute to the intensity recorded with spin–orbit
split doublets (j = 5/2, 3/2 for d-type orbitals,
with the branching ratio close to 1.5) whose components are separated
by 1.7 eV.54,56−59 We will hereafter refer to the
sole j = 5/2 component.

Figure 6 I 4d XP region for the
sample NiO/EryB/sol. The experimental data
(dots) have been theoretically reconstructed with a series of spin–orbit
doublets (j = 5/2 and 3/2) via a peak-fitting procedure
(continuous lines). Blue: I–; green: terminal I
atoms in I3–; magenta: central I atom
in I3–; red: I atoms in EryB.

The first more intense contribution at 48.40 eV
(see Table 1) comes
from the iodide (I–) ions, which adsorb on the surface
of NiO because
of their relatively high concentration in the solution and their relatively
concentrated negative charge, which enables an electrostatic interaction
with native partially compensated Ni(III) defects within the porous
NiO.33 Upon increasing the BE, the other
chemically shifted components found are I3– ions (ΔBE = +0.7 eV) and the EryB molecule (ΔBE = +1.95
eV). In particular, the I3– molecule
has inequivalent I atoms, which contribute the overall intensity envelope
at different BEs. In fact, the central I atom is less negative than
the two equivalent terminal atoms, and its BE is positively shifted
by 0.8 eV from the terminal ones.33 Therefore,
the most easily ionizable iodinated species is the I– anion, which bears the highest negative charge density, hence displaying
the lowest BE. On the other side, I atoms in the EryB molecule are
covalently bound to C atoms, therefore experiencing a minor fraction
of negative charge, which increases their BE compared to I– and I3–. The BE position of the three
iodinated species is fully consistent with the literature.31,33 Quantitatively, the relative molar amount of the species adsorbed
onto the electrode is fully favorable to the I– ion
(see Table 2), which
is found in a ratio to its counterpart I3– higher than expected from the relative concentrations in solution,
consistently with what was previously found for unsensitized NiO.33 As to the EryB component, this is as well found
in minor relative concentration (see Table 2), and its molar amount relative to NiO on
passing from the NiO/EryB to the NiO/EryB/sol sample decreases too
(see Figure 7a and Table 3). This decrease after
dipping in the electrolyte solution is likely attributable to a partial
attenuation of the photoelectron coming from the adsorbed dye exerted
by a fraction of the overlying redox couple species. This eventually
hampers a direct quantitative comparison between the reference NiO/EryB
sample and the unreacted NiO/EryB/sol system (Figure 7a,b).

Bearing
in mind the general distribution of the various chemical
components within the I 4d envelope, we pass now to examine the effects
induced by the electrochemical treatments. Sample CV 1 underwent one
potential cycling via CV, and its I 4d spectrum is reported in Figure 7c. In this case,
the relative molar amounts (Table 2) of both I3– and EryB
moderately increase, the former probably due to oxidation of I– ions, followed by inefficient release of the freshly
formed I3– ions from the NiO pores to
the solution, as already previously observed in the absence of the
dye.33 As to the relative increase in the
EryB signal, this might be associated to a more homogeneous dispersion
of the redox couple anions within the pores of the electrode and in
proximity of the freshly generated Ni(III) centers driven by the positive
polarization during the anodic scan, which would lessen the attenuation
effect compared to the probably layered structure derived by the simple
dipping (NiO/EryB/sol). Furthermore, it is to be noted that the overall
amount of redox couple anions increases after 1 CV cycle (Table 3) because of physical
entrapment within the pores and irreversible electrostatic compensation
of generated Ni(III) centers. Upon repeated cycling (CV 50 sample, Figure 7d), the total amount
of iodinated species slightly decreases (Table 3), apparently due to a more efficient depletion
of the pores from the adsorbed species coupled to a probable partial
detachment of the dye molecules.31 As reported
in Figure 1 and in
the electrochemical characterization section, although a small drop
is detected in the overall amount of iodinated species after 50 potential
cycles, a decrease in the concentration of the electroactive species
is experienced in parallel. According to this, a change in the quality
of the interaction between the substrate and electrolyte anions may
occur along with repeated potential cycling, which causes an irreversible
stabilization of an increasing portion of Ni(III) charged centers.

The oxidation procedure, which implies holding the potential at
0.9 V for 8000 s (Ox sample, Figure 7e), produces an increase in the total amount of redox
couple anions while holding constant the amount of the EryB dye. Furthermore,
the increase is apparently more pronounced for the I3– anion, consistently with its expected electrochemical
generation from the oxidation of I– ions at the
potential applied and can be attributed to an accumulation of the
hindered triiodide anions within the NiO pores and their hampered
diffusion back to the solution bulk. This enrichment of the surface
with redox couple anions is fully consistent with what was found in
the case of bare NiO in the same solution.33

As a conclusive spectrum, in Figure 7f the one relative to the sample reduced
by holding
the potential at −0.27 V for 8000 s (Red sample) is reported.
This spectrum presents only the I component from the EryB dye, suggesting
that upon negative polarization the electrode surface is depleted
from all the strongly and weakly adsorbed negative ions. On the other
hand, the EryB molecule experiences partial detachment upon prolonged
negative polarization. This behavior is in general agreement with
what we recently reported for the same NiO/EryB system in contact
with a LiClO4/ACN solution undergoing the same kind of
electrochemical treatments.31 However,
in that case, a more dramatic impact of electrochemical stress on
surface-immobilized EryB was evidenced. In particular, when potential
cycles were continuously applied, a strong interaction between charge
compensating ClO4– anions and the defective/oxidized
sites of the NiO surface was established, with the more facile detachment
of the dye as a possible consequence.

Overall, as evidenced
by the I 4d spectra reported in Figure 7 and from the comparison
with previously reported results, the presence of the chemisorbed
dye exerts a moderate passivation of those defective sites in NiO
which may act as ion-trapping centers. In fact, the adsorption of
redox couple anions induced by different electrochemical treatments
applied to simulate the possible conditions the cathode may encounter
upon operation in a real DSC is in the present case easily canceled
out by a potentiostatic reductive polarization (see the Red sample),
which calls for a less intimate interaction between the substrate
and the electrolyte anions. Instead, in the absence of the dye,33 an irreversible stabilization of native and/or
electrochemically generated Ni(III) sites is carried out by the iodide
and triiodide anions and is hard to recover even with prolonged reductive
polarization.33

As to the behavior
of the immobilized EryB dye, it turns out that
the presence of the I3–/I– couple in the electrolyte constitutes an advantageous condition
in terms of stability of the dye molecule, with respect to the situation
in which the electrolyte in contact with EryB-sensitized NiO contains
only the supporting electrolyte LiClO4.31

Likely, the decrease of I signal after the electrochemical
treatment
is associated with the detachment of the EryB dye from the NiO electrode.
This is coherent with the observations of the electrochemical tests:
as evidenced in Figure 1, upon repeated potential cycling, a decrease of faradic current
was recorded and the voltammogram of cycled NiO/EryB becomes progressively
similar to the one of bare NiO with the observation of a quasi-complete
overlap after 50 cycles of potential scan (Figure 1).

I 3d
Figure 8 reports the I 3d
photoionization region for all the samples
investigated. The I 3d spectra appear as a mixture of well-resolved
spin–orbit split doublets (ΔEso = 11.4 eV)
with a symmetrical shape (except for Mg Kα ghost lines).59 The 3d5/2 component of EryB is located
at 620.50 eV (red filled curves in Figure 8) compatibly with other alkyl- and aryl-iodide
systems,60−63 significantly higher than the mixed contribution of I– and I3– species (cyan filled curves
in Figure 8), which
are enclosed in a single component, because of the irrelevant chemical
shift effect between them, as reported in our previous work.33 The relative intensities of the dye and electrolyte
ion contributions qualitatively follow the trend observed in the I
4d region, confirming, for example, the absence of a contribution
related to the redox couple anions in the Red sample. On the other
hand, a general caution must be taken in comparing I 4d and I 3d spectra
because the chemical information provided by the latter is related
to a more superficial portion of the NiO/dye/electrolyte system because
of the lower kinetic energy of outgoing I 3d photoelectrons. Furthermore,
an additional component was variably detected in the I 3d spectra
of these samples, here evidenced with gray color in Figure 8a,f. This minor doublet is
located ∼2 eV lower than the main one and is probably due to
the degradation of the EryB dye upon prolonged X-ray exposure. Its
occurrence is limited to I 3d signals because these were always acquired
after the I 4d region, thus after longer X-ray exposures. An additional
positively shifted component (+5.2 eV vs anion peak, yellow curve
in Figure 8b) was necessary
to reconstruct the NiO/EryB/sol sample spectrum, which is difficult
to account for unless the possibility of differential electrostatic
charging is considered, probably arising from portions of the porous
film where the electrolyte anions are inefficiently contacted with
the substrate. As commented above, the application of potential cycling
(CV 1 sample) would induce a more homogeneous dispersion of anions
on the surface, thus eliminating this issue.

the samples described. Samples from top

with continuous lines. See text for assignments.

Ni 2p
In Figure 9, the Ni 2p3/2 regions are reported for all the
sample studied in this work. The line shape of all the spectra reveals
the typical envelope of NiO,64−67 whose detailed description can be found elsewhere.30,64,66,67 As a good compromise between conciseness and completeness, in this
work, the different contributions to the overall spectrum are simply
indicated by lines with capital letters from A to F. The first (A)
more intense peak is attributed to the cd9L state (c and L, respectively, represent holes in the 2p level and
in a ligand orbital),66−68 whereas B and C contributions are associated with
core-hole screening processes occurring at the surface, where the
bulk symmetry is reduced and the coordination geometry around Ni is
lowered from the octahedral NiO6 to the square-pyramidal
NiO5.65,67,69 Components from D to F are also typical of NiO and respectively
associated with cd10L2 and cd8 final states
and a shake-up transition.64,70−72 Although NiO is undoubtedly an off-stoichiometric compound with
Ni3+ defects, during the years it has been widely accepted70,73 that recognition of a Ni3+ feature within the Ni 2p photoionization
envelope cannot be operated unless a genuine Ni(III) compound is actually
under consideration, such as in NiOOH polymorphs.30,72 The close similarity among the Ni 2p spectra in Figure 9 suggests that in this NiO/dye/(nonaqueous)
electrolyte complex interface, the possible electrochemically induced
generation of Ni(III) and Ni(IV) centers leaves no detectable trace
in the Ni 2p XP spectrum.32

Conclusions
Photocathodes
for p-DSCs were obtained by the sensitization of
nanostructured NiO films. The mesoporous films of NiO were deposited
by means of a screen-printing technique onto FTO transparent electrodes
and were successively dipped in an EryB dye solution. The obtained
material was contacted to the nonaqueous electrolyte (ACN) containing
the I3–/I– redox couple,
with the aim of studying the dynamics of adsorption at the triple
semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interface following electrochemical
treatments in dark conditions. Such treatments involved both voltammetric
and chronoamperometric polarization programs and were devised in order
to simulate the electrical environment the NiO/dye system experiences
in illuminated DSCs.

The current originated by the oxidation
of iodide at the EryB/NiO
electrode surpasses considerably the current originated by the same
redox event at a bare NiO electrode. The effects induced by the sensitization
of NiO with EryB consisted in the promotion of the adsorptive properties
of the starting species I– and in the improvement
of the capability of the electrode to desorb the triiodide anions,
which are formed upon reversal of the potential scan. Moreover, from
the analysis of electrochemical and XPS data, we could not exclude
the existence of a catalytic effect exerted by the immobilized molecules
of EryB. This effect would consist in the involvement of the I atoms
of EryB as initiators/mediators of iodide oxidation. The latter mechanistic
hypothesis is supported by the verification of a progressive detachment
of the anchored dye upon prolongation of electrochemical cycling.

The analysis of I 4d and I 3d XP spectra evidenced that the presence
of the chemisorbed dye both exerts a moderate passivating action of
those defective sites in NiO which may act as ion-trapping centers
and ensures an enrichment of the redox couple species at the surface
of the electrode. Such findings are fully coherent with the current
enhancement of sensitized versus unsensitized NiO electrode recorded
in the first voltammetric cycle. Oxidative potentiostatic polarization
led to an enrichment of the NiO/EryB system with triiodide, as expected.
Instead, the adsorption of both redox couple anions was in the present
case easily canceled out by a potentiostatic reductive polarization.
As to the behavior of the immobilized EryB dye, the XP spectra revealed
that the presence of the I3–/I– couple in the electrolyte constitutes an advantageous condition
in terms of stability of the dye molecular (mono)layer.

The
results obtained constitute a significant step forward in the
understanding of the basic mechanisms of adsorption governing the
electrochemical reactions at the semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interfaces
typical of DSC devices. Such understanding represents a considerable
progress in the further definition of viable routes for the inhibition
of deleterious recombination phenomena in DSCs.
