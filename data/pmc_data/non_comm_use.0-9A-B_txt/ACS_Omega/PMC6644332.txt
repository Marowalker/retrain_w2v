This contribution
deals with the synthesis and utilization of a
new pyrazole-based unsymmetrical ligand, 3-(3-carboxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (H2CPCA), for generating
multifunctional materials. The reaction with the Co(II) salt in the
presence of a co-ligand 2,9-dimethyl phenanthroline (dmphen) results
in the formation of the helical compound {[Co2(dmphen)2(CPCA)2]DMF}n (1). However, two isostructural monomeric complexes are formed
{[M(HCPCA)2(H2O)2], M = Co(II), (2) and Mn(II) (3)} when reactions were carried
out in the absence of dmphen. Compound 1 shows some highly
encouraging single-ion magnetic (SIM) properties. Detailed magnetic
studies unveil slow relaxation of magnetization of compound 1, driven by the higher magnetic anisotropy of the cobalt
ion, with the energy barrier of ∼9.2 K and relaxation time
of 9.1 × 10–5 s, suggesting a SIM behavior.
Moreover, UV–vis and fluorescence studies confirm the selective
dye degradation of compound 1 with methylene blue both
in the presence and absence of H2O2, with the
remarkable degradation efficiency of ∼98 and ∼82%, respectively.

Introduction
Coordination polymers
(CPs) featuring superiorities in rational
design and synthesis have become a research hotspot in the multifunctional
material field.1 CPs have received much
attention from chemists because of their attractive structures and
potential applications in various fronts including adsorption, dye
degradation, magnetism, luminescence, etc.2 Significant efforts have been devoted to generate multifunctional
CPs for performing various activities with only one system rather
than using different single-purpose systems. Interestingly, the functional
activity of CPs often holds a one-to-one correspondence with the characteristic
features of the ligand or metals used for synthesis.3 Synergism of the multiple properties in a single system
therefore can be originated or induced using an appropriate combination
of constituents with prerequisite features. Therefore, careful selection of organic ligands and metal salts
is at the heart of CP synthesis for targeted multifunctional activities.45

Magnetism,
inter alia, has remained one of the prime motifs for
CP synthesis. However, an unexpected thrust, especially among the
scientists of inorganic chemistry background, came from the contemporary
discovery of single molecular magnets (SMMs).5a Since the discovery of the Mn12 cluster in early 1990s,
scientists are actively engaged in generating exchange-coupled polynuclear
clusters having SMM property.5b However,
most of them are traditional discrete inorganic complexes usually
based on Fe6 or Mn.7 This is because the SMM property is related to an energy barrier
for the reversal of the molecular magnetic moment, which is described
as Ueff = |D|S2 (for integer spin).8 The higher the energy barrier, the greater the possibility of SMM
behavior.9−11 On the other hand, the energy barrier can be increased
by increasing the ground state spin (S), which is
again directly proportional to the spin nuclearity. However, the approach
of a multinuclear system also has limitations as quite a large number
of systems of high-spin ground states fail to yield higher barriers.12 This shifts the focus away from the multinuclear
systems and leads to an alternate strategy, proposed by Waldmann and
later on by Neese and Pantazis,15 of maximizing
the relaxation barriers through increasing the magnetic anisotropy.13,14 Along this line, Ishikawa introduces mononuclear SMMs in terms of
the [LnPc2]− ion (Pc = pthalocyanine).15c Subsequently, 3d transition-metal-based
mononuclear SMM, known as a single-ion magnet (SIM), was reported
by Long for high-spin Fe(II) compounds.16,17 Recent focus
is aiming on Co(II) compounds because the S = 3/2
half-integer spin state should minimize quantum-tunneling effects
and lead to favorable relaxation behavior.18 Furthermore, Co(II) has both orbital and spin contributions toward
magnetic moments, which certainly help to have a large number of microstate
energy levels in the double-well energy diagram of SMM. Finally, Co(II)
compounds have large anisotropy, which is very crucial for enhancing
the energy barrier and thus makes them suitable for SMM.19−21 It is noteworthy here that a large number of Co(II)-based SIMs were
reported having different coordination geometries and environments
but most of them are with tetrahedral or pseudo-tetrahedral geometry,
while a few exhibit higher coordination numbers of 5 or 6.22

Another important aspect of CPs is their
application in environmental
remediation. Of particular importance is water pollution, which has
now become a major global problem with serious consequences on human
health and environment. A significant discharge of organic dyes from
printing/textile factories is the major source of this problem.23 Naturally, as a preventive measure, removal
of such toxic metals from wastewater warrants remediation prior to
their disposal in navigable waters or land. Interestingly, CPs, among
the others, have emerged as promising candidates as efficient and
low-cost materials for wastewater treatment.24

Inspired by the above-mentioned considerations, we endeavored
to
successfully synthesize three new Co- and Mn-based multifunctional
compounds using a new pyrazole-based unsymmetrical ligand, 3-(3-carboxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (H2CPCA) (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Reaction of Co(II)
with H2CPCA and 2,9-dimethyl phenanthroline
(dmphen) forms a mononuclear CP {[Co2(dmphen)2(CPCA)2]DMF}n (1), whereas two mononuclear complexes [M(HCPCA)2(H2O)2] (M = Co (2) and Mn (3)) were obtained with the reaction of Co(II), Mn(II), and H2CPCA but in the absence of dmphen. Compound 1 shows
some interesting magnetic behavior, which qualifies for SIM. The magnetic
properties of compounds 2 and 3 have also
been studied for comparison. We also report here the chirality and
selective dye degradation properties of compound 1.

Experimental
Section
Materials and General Method
All reagents and chemicals
except ligand were purchased from available commercial sources and
were used without further purification. Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 spectrometer
with samples prepared as KBr pellets. C, H, and N microanalyses were
carried out with a 2400 Series-II CHN analyzer, PerkinElmer. Magnetic
measurements were performed using a Quantum Design VSM SQUID magnetometer.
The measured values were corrected for the experimentally measured
contribution of the sample holder, while the derived susceptibilities
were corrected for the diamagnetism of the samples, estimated from
Pascal’s tables. All of the compounds were characterized by
elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis. Crystallographic data and refinement parameters for all
compounds are given in a tabular form (Table S1).

X-ray Crystallography
X-ray diffraction intensities
for compounds 1–3 were collected
at 100 K on Bruker D8 Venture APEX-3, using Mo Kα radiation
with a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor detector. The structures
were solved by direct methods in SHELXS and refined by full-matrix
least squares on F2 in SHELXL.25 CIF files for the structures reported in this
article have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre (CCDC). The CCDC numbers are 1864470–1864472. Crystallographic
data and refinement parameters for all compounds are given in a tabular
form (Table S1). Bond distances and bond
angles of all of the compounds are summarized in Table S2.

Selective Dye Sequestration
In the
experiment carried
out in the absence of H2O2, freshly prepared
compound 1 (20 mg) in a powder form was added to the
aqueous solutions of methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB), rhodamine
B (RhB), and Congo red 2 (BR-2) (5 mL, 10 mg L–1), respectively. After 48 h of impregnation, the compounds were washed
with ethanol and dried in air. Similar experiments were performed
in the presence of catalytic amount of H2O2,
and within 2 h, only methylene blue solution was decolorized.

Synthesis
Caution! Although we do not encounter any
problem, appropriate care should be taken in the use of the potentially
explosive perchlorate salts.

Synthesis of H2CPCA
Synthesis
of Ethyl 4-(3-Cyanophenyl)-2-hydroxy-4-oxobutanoate
(A)
Potassium tert-butoxide
(4.5 g, 40.10 mmol) was taken in dry diethyl ether (200 mL) at room
temperature under a N2 atmosphere under stirring conditions.
Diethyl oxalate (4.4 mL, 30.10 mmol) was added to this solution. After
15 min of stirring, 3-acetylbenzonitrile (4.35 g, 29.96 mmol) was
added to the resulting mixture, and stirring was further continued
for overnight. A light yellow precipitate was obtained, and the whole
resulting mixture was taken in a separating funnel for washing with
water. Approximately, 20 mL of water was used for this purpose. The
entire aqueous layer was then transferred in a beaker and cooled for
some time. The resultant solution was then acidified with dilute HCl
(2 mL). This results in a yellow precipitate of ethyl 4-(3-cyanophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate,
which was filtered and air-dried (3.3 g, 76.74% yield).

Synthesis
of Ethyl 3-(3-Cyanophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate
(B)
Hydrazine monohydrate (0.65 mL) was added
dropwise to a ethanolic (40 mL) solution containing ethyl 4-(3-cyanophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate
with constant stirring. The resulting solution was stirred and refluxed
for 24 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature,
and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue
was washed with water and recrystallized from methanol. 4-(3-Cyanophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate
was obtained as a light yellow crystalline powder (3.44 g).

Synthesis
of 3-(3-Carboxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic
Acid (H2CPCA)
Dried 4-(3-cyanophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate
(3.44 g, 14.27 mmol) was added portionwise in a water solution of
NaOH (880 mg, 22 mmol) under stirring conditions and refluxed for
overnight. A clear golden yellow solution was obtained; then, the
solution was filtered by a Whatman filter paper. The resultant solution
was made just acidic using 6 N HCl. This leads to an off-white precipitate,
which was then filtered, air-dried, and recrystallized from methanol
(47.5% yield based on 3-acetylbenzonitrile).

Results and Discussion
Structural Description
Single-crystal
X-ray structure
analysis of compound 1 revealed that the compound crystallizes
in the P21/n space group
with one Co(II) ion, one CPCA2–, dmphen, and one-half
of a DMF solvent molecule (Figure S6) in
the asymmetric unit. Each cobalt atom acquires a distorted trigonal
prismatic geometry, having a N3O3 coordination
environment where two N atoms come from the chelating dmphen moiety
and one N atom from the CPCA2– ligand, while the
O atoms coming from two CPCA2– molecules (Figure 1b). The structural
analysis shows that compound 1 forms an interesting one-dimensional
(1D) helical network, facilitated by the V-shaped functional arrangement
of the CPCA2– ligand and sustained by π–π
stacking between dmphen rings. It is noteworthy here that the conformation
of the ligand molecule, especially the angle between coordinating
sites linked by a spacer with specific positional orientation, is
considered to be the key factor for helical coordination network formation.26−29 The common trend is that helical network formation becomes favorable
as the angle tends to 120°.

and left-handed isomer (Δ-isomer); (d) π–π
stacked double-stranded helix resulting from interweaving two single-strand

For compound 1, the
helical 1D network propagated
through the CPCA2– ligand where one side is coordinated
to the carboxylate group and another side to the chelating carboxylate–pyrazole
moiety (Figure 1).
The helical pitch, given by the distance between equivalent atoms
generated by one full rotation of the screw axis, can be defined by
the alternate Co···Co distance of 10.856 Å. However,
a closer inspection of the structure reveals an intriguing aspect
of the handedness of helical chains with the coexistence of two kinds
of helical networks, a left-handed and a right-handed helical network
(Figure 2b). The alternate
helical chain is composed of one particular type of helical chain,
either left-handed or right-handed. Such juxtaposition of helical
networks brings their dmphens molecules very close to each other to
form π–π interactions30 with 3.72–3.80 Å face-to-face separation (Figure 1d).

compounds 2 and 3. (b) Coordination geometry

Crystal Structure of Compounds 2 and 3
Both compounds 2 and 3 crystalize
in the Pbca space group and are isostructural in
nature. The asymmeric unit of compound 2 (3) contains two HCPCA– ligands, two H2O molecules, and a metal ion (Figure 2). The metal ion acquires octahedral geometry having
a N2O4 coordination environment (Figure 2b). The basal plane was formed
by two N atoms of two pyrazole moieties of two ligands and two O atoms
from the −COOH group of two HCPCA– ligands.
The apical positions are occupied by two water molecules. The packing
diagram shows that the alternative planes are equidistanced (7.427
Å) and that they are parallel (AA/BB) to each other (Figure S7).

Solid-State Circular Dichroism
(CD) Analysis of Compound 1
Individual presence
of left- and right-handed helical
networks prompted us to study the possibility of forming chiral inorganic
complexes via spontaneous resolution. Recently, several reports confirmed
that chiral inorganic complexes can be generated through spontaneous
resolution even in the absence of any optically active ligands. For
compound 1, solid-state CD investigations were carried
out using a diffused reluctance technique at room temperature over
the KBr matrix. The compound shows a positive cotton effect with two
broad signals at 251 and 309 nm (Figure 3). The experiment was repeated several times
from different batches of crystals, and same CD spectra were obtained,
confirming the presence of chirality. The most probable reasons for
chirality could be the local environment of the octahedral metal center
and subsequent transmission of chirality from the metal center to
the helical network. Furthermore, this is consistent with earlier
reports that when more than one diimine (like 2-2′-bpy, 1,10-phen)
chelating ligands prefer to bind to an octahedral metal center characteristic
peaks due to the Cotton effect arise in the CD spectrum.31

Figure 3 Solid-state CD spectrum of compound 1.

Selective Dye Binding with
Compound 1
Organic dyes such as methylene blue
(MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and
Congo red are the most common organic pollutants of water. In recent
years, inorganic polymeric compounds like CPs have been widely used
for wastewater treatment.32 Organic dye
sequestration by CPs usually has two different routes: (a) chemical
reaction at the surface of the CPs and (b) photocatalytic degradation
in the presence of an inorganic catalyst.33 The later process is particularly suitable for CPs based on metal,
which can easily adopt variable oxidation states during the catalytic
cycles. Keeping this in mind, we explore the dye degradation capability
of compound 1. Considering the insolubility of compound 1 in water, a heterogeneous photocatalytic process using visible
light was investigated. Accordingly, freshly prepared compound 1 in a powder form was added into the aqueous solution of
methylene blue, rhodamine B, methyl orange, and Congo red, separately.
After 48 h, the methylene dye solution was decolorized, while the
solutions containing other dyes retained their respective colors (Figure 4). This suggests
that compound 1 itself selectively degrades methylene
blue over other dyes. However, the rate of degradation was relatively
slow. This led us to study the degradation with the Fenton oxidation
procedure using hydrogen peroxide, which generates hydroxyl radicals
and in the presence of Co(II) CPs provides the activation to accelerate
the process for effective degradation of organic pollutants. Indeed,
upon addition of one drop of catalytic H2O2,
dye degradation took place at a considerably faster rate and bleaching
of bright blue color of the dye completed within 60 min. The enhancement
in the rate could be linked to the attacks of OH• radicals, initiating the oxidation procedure for the degradation,
while a plausible mechanism can be envisaged as follows 1   2   3  Furthermore,
to determine the rate of dye
degradation, kinetic studies were performed using UV–vis and
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy techniques individually both in
the presence and absence of H2O2. Accordingly,
time-dependent UV–vis spectra of the dye solution containing
compound 1 were recorded, which show a distinct trend
in the absorption maxima of the dye at 665 nm. Over time, the intensity
of the peak shows a steady decrease with a concomitant bleaching of
the blue color of the dye after about 1 and 35 h in the presence and
absence of H2O2, respectively. Both the dye
degradation processes were found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics
for which the rate law can be represented as 4  where Ct is the
concentration of dye at time t, At is the absorbance of dye at time t, C0 is the concentration of dye at t = 0, A0 is the absorbance of dye at t = 0, and Kapp is the apparent
rate constant.

Figure 4 (a) Photograph of time-dependent noticeable photodegradation
of
methylene blue dye solution by compound 1 in the presence
of H2O2 (within 60 min) and (b) in the absence
of H2O2 (within 48 h). (c) Comparative picture
showing selective methylene blue dye degradation in comparison to
that of Congo red, methyl orange, and rhodamine B.

The rate constants were subsequently determined
by plotting ln(Ct/C0) versus
time, which fairly follows
the pseudo-first-order kinetics with a linear fitting34 (Figure 5). Apparently, compound 1 shows higher activity as a
catalyst to degrade the dye in a Fenton-like process with Kapp = 8 × 10–2 s–1 compared to that in the nonradical process, showing Kapp = 9.9 × 10–3 s–1 (Table 1). Furthermore, the dye degradation efficiency was also calculated
from the data, and it was found that degradation efficiencies are
∼82 and ∼98% in the absence and presence of H2O2, respectively.

H2O2. Photodegradation efficiency in the (C)

Moreover, photoluminescence property was further investigated
for
compound 1, both with and without H2O2. Interestingly, when the experiments were carried out in
the absence of H2O2 and a decrease in intensity
was a recurrent theme, a red shift of ∼53 nm (λem = 734 nm) (Figure 6) was also observed. This unusual luminescent red shift can be attributed
to the interaction of dye with compound 1.35

Figure 6 (a) PL spectra of compound 1 in the presence
and (b)
absence of H2O2; notice a clear red shift in
the emission spectrum.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern recorded for
compound 1 after the degradation of dye (Figure 7) shows an interesting feature.
Although
the PXRD patterns satisfactorily match with the simulated pattern,
some additional new peaks also appeared. When these samples were further
analyzed by FT-IR spectra, some interesting observations were noted.
Although the fingerprint region before and after interaction with
the dye remains the same, shifting of some characteristic peaks was
observed (e.g., 3423–3275 nm; 2974–2751 nm; 1627–1447
nm; 1391–1206 nm), which can be attributed to the interaction
of the dye molecule and compound 1. To inspect whether
compound 1 adsorbs the dye molecule or has any accessible
void space, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) adsorption
was studied and surface area was calculated (Figure S9). However, it shows very poor adsorption capability with
BET surface area of 2.6058 m2 g–1. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the dye molecule interacts with compound 1 through a helical grove but does not adsorb at the surface.

Magnetic Study
Direct current (dc) magnetic susceptibility
data of all of the compounds were collected on polycrystalline samples
in the temperature range of 2–300 K at a field of 0.1 T (Figure 8). The room temperature
χMT values are 6.27, 2.76, and 3.94
cm3 mol–1 K for compounds 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For compounds 1 and 2, experimental χMT values are higher than spin-only values of 3.75 and 1.875
cm3 mol–1 K for two and one Co(II) centers,
respectively. Higher experimental values can be explained on the basis
of orbital contribution of the Co(II) ion (Table 2). The experimental value of compound 3 is slightly lower than the theoretical values of 4.375 cm3 mol–1 K for one Mn(II) spin center having S = 5/2, g = 2.0.

dc magnetic susceptibility of compounds 1–3. The red lines are the best fit.

χMT (cm3 mol–1 K) Values of Compounds 1 and 2

1	3.75	6.705	6.27	
2	1.875	3.352	2.76	
For all three compounds 1–3, χMT values gradually decrease with the temperature
probably due to weak antiferromagnetic interactions with the nearest
metal centers or due
to the crystal field effect.

Isothermal magnetization (M/Nβ vs H) for compound 1 was plotted
for the temperature range of 2–10 K from 0 to 5 T, which shows
that the plot does not saturate even at the highest field of 5 T (Figure 9). The maximum M/Nβ value of 5.5Nβ was obtained at 5 and 2 K. The maximum experimental value
is lower than the maximum theoretical value of 6Nβ, suggesting the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions
or anisotropy. To examine the anisotropy of the system, M/Nβ was plotted versus H/T and this shows that all of the isotherms do not fall on
the same master plot, which clearly reveals the existence of anisotropy
of compound 1. Therefore, we were interested in studying
alternating current (ac) measurements. Compounds 2 and 3 did not show any significant peak for SMM. If we closely look at the geometry
around Co(II) centers of compounds 1 and 2, compound 1 has distorted trigonal prismatic geometry,
which may originate magnetic anisotropy suitable for slow relaxation
of magnetization.12 On the other hand,
compound 2 has almost perfect octahedral geometry, which
may be responsible for the absence of any slow relaxation of magnetization.36 The anisotropy parameters of Co(II) centers
in compounds 1 and 2 have been calculated
by fitting the susceptibility data and magnetization data using PHI
software;37 during the fitting procedure,
the g tensor was considered to be isotropic. The
best fits of the experimental data gave D = 38.2(4)
cm–1, E = 1.2(7) × 10–4 cm–1, and g =
2.28 for 1; D = 31.5(1) cm–1, E = 4.6(4) × 10–2 cm–1, and g = 2.21 for 2 (where D and E represent the single-ion
axial and rhombic zero-field splitting parameters, respectively).
The values of the anisotropy parameters for 1 are found
to be good enough for six-coordinated Co(II) complexes, showing single-ion
magnetic behavior.38 The positive sign
of the D parameter arises from the interaction between
the ground and excited electronic states coupled through spin–orbit
coupling. However, for compound 2, the D value may not be good enough in that temperature region due to the
geometry and crystal field effect for not showing any SMM behavior.

(b) M/Nβ vs H/T plot for compound 1. The
red lines are the best fit.

To check the type of exchange interaction between nearby
Mn(II)
centers in compound 3, we have attempted to fit the susceptibility
data using PHI software. The best fit resulted in JMn-Mn = −0.11 ± 0.05 cm–1 and g = 2.0 ± 0.04 (Figure 8), suggesting very weak antiferromagnetic
interactions between the nearby Mn(II) centers in compound 3. J indicates the exchange interaction between the
nearby neighbors.

To investigate the SMM behavior of compound 1, ac
susceptibility measurements were carried out in the temperature range
of 2–10 K. At 0 dc field, both in-phase and out-of-phase susceptibility
measurements did not show any significant peak due to quantum tunneling
of magnetization (QTM). To suppress the QTM, ac measurements were
performed at different dc fields. At an optimized dc field of 0.5
T, both in-phase and out-of-phase maxima were observed (Figure 10). Temperature-dependent
out-of-phase ac susceptibility plots reveal the existence of slow
relaxation of magnetization and SMM behavior.

Figure 10 Temperature dependence
of the in-phase (χ′) (a) and
out-of-phase (χ″) (b) ac susceptibility for compound 1 under a field of 0.5 T.

To estimate the relaxation time and energy barrier of compound 1, ln(ω) was plotted versus 1/T and
fitted using the Arrhenius equation: ln(ω) = ln(1/τ0) – (Eeff/kT) (Figure 11), where
ω is the frequency, τ0 is the relaxation time,
and Eeff is the energy barrier. From the
fitting, energy barrier (E/k) =
9.2 K and relaxation time (τ0) = 9.1 × 10–5 s were obtained. The relaxation time is in the range
of SMM.

equation.

Conclusions
The
major impetus for this study was to generate multifunctional
coordination complexes using a novel pyrazole-based ligand. Accordingly,
we have successfully synthesized three coordination compounds, among
which a coordination polymer exhibits multifunctional properties.
The helical CP shows an interesting chirality originated from the
local coordination environment of the metal ion with corroborating CD spectrum. The Co(II)-based CP shows an interesting
magnetic feature of single-ion magnetism, while the corresponding
relaxation time falls well within the normal range of SMM. The magnetic
results presented herein clearly indicate our strategy of using Co-based
CP to maximize the relaxation barrier through increasing magnetic
anisotropy for achieving SMM behavior. The Co-based CP also shows
excellent photocatalytic degradation of toxic dye molecules with a
potential application in wastewater purification.
