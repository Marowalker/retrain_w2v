Enzyme-catalyzed controlled radical
polymerization represents a
powerful approach for the polymerization of a wide variety of water-soluble
monomers. However, in such an enzyme-based polymerization system,
the macromolecular catalyst (i.e., enzyme) has to be separated from
the polymer product. Here, we present a compelling approach for the
separation of the two macromolecular species, by taking the catalyst
out of the molecular domain and locating it in the colloidal domain,
ensuring quasi-homogeneous catalysis as well as easy separation of
precious biocatalysts. We report on gold nanoparticles coated with
horseradish peroxidase that can catalyze the polymerization of various
monomers (e.g., N-isopropylacrylamide), yielding
thermoresponsive polymers. Strikingly, these biocatalyst-coated nanoparticles
can be recovered completely and reused in more than three independent
polymerization cycles, without significant loss of their catalytic
activity.

Introduction
Enzymes represent a
family of nontoxic, environmentally friendly
catalysts, which have proven to be a powerful tool in the polymerization
of a wide variety of monomers and macromonomers.1−3 Recent publications
even demonstrate the use of peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase
(HRP), catalase from bovine liver, and laccase from trametes versicolor
as biocatalysts in controlled radical polymerizations.4−8 For the separation of the two macromolecular species, centrifugal
filters with different molecular weight cutoffs can be employed, given
that the molecular weight of the catalytic enzyme is different from
that of the polymer product.6,7

One alternative
and highly compelling approach for the separation
of the two macromolecular species is to take one of the protagonists,
preferentially the catalyst, out of the molecular domain and locate
it in the colloidal domain, ensuring quasi-homogeneous catalysis as
well as easy separation. This can be achieved by immobilizing the
enzymes onto nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, metal and metal oxide
NPs in the size range of 5–200 nm fulfill most of the desired
requirements: (1) quasi-homogeneous catalysis as their dimension
is on the nanoscale and their physical properties, such as diffusion
constants, lie between molecular and colloidal domains,9−12 thus ensuring higher reaction rates than heterogeneous catalysis;
(2) high surface/volume ratio, ensuring relatively high catalyst concentration
in the immobilized state;13,14 and the last but not
least (3) a simple and straightforward separation from the product
by various techniques like centrifugation,15−17 or in the case
of magnetic NPs by magnetic separation.18

In general, proteins and enzymes can be immobilized onto solid
supports using various techniques,13,19,20 such as (a) “multipoint” covalent
bonding via click chemistry20−22 or coupling reactions, yielding
amide23−25 or imine bonds,26−28 (b) cross-linking,29 (c) affinity immobilization,30,31 (d) entrapment,32,33 and (e) adsorption.15,16,34,35 Depending on the immobilization technique, the immobilization can
enhance the properties of enzymes in terms of thermal stability, tolerance
to extreme pH, and organic solvents.36 Therefore,
immobilized enzymes can appear to have higher activities than native
enzymes under drastic conditions due to the enhanced stability.34,36−42 On the other hand, the apparent activity of conventional immobilized
enzymes can also be lower than that of their native counterparts,
mainly because of the hindered substrate accessing or unfavorable
conformational transition of the enzyme on the support.13,43−46 Particularly in the case of colloidal supports, the catalytic performance
of the immobilized enzymes also strongly depends on the colloidal
stability of the colloidal support.9,34 The catalytic
performance of the enzymes immobilized onto NPs can decrease drastically,
due to hindered accessibility of the substrates to their active sites,9 when the NPs are not stable and aggregate or
sediment in the reaction media. Hence, to create a functional enzymatically
active colloidal system, a robust enzyme immobilization on the NPs
as well as a colloidally stable system is required.

Recently,
we have reported a quite simple approach for a highly
robust immobilization of proteins and enzymes onto metal and metal
oxide NPs, simply via physisorption in a ligand-exchange process.15,16,34,35,47−52 Different enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase,
laccase, and catalase, were directly immobilized onto plasmonic gold
NPs and superparamagnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4)
NPs, yielding colloidally stable enzyme-coated NP systems. The enzyme
coating on the NP surface is highly robust and enzymatically active.
The colloidal stability and enzymatic performance (Vmax, Km) of the enzyme-coated
NPs (Au@enzyme) are strongly dependent on the pH of the dispersion
and the physicochemical properties of the respective enzyme. Hence,
gold NPs are particularly suitable for the immobilization of proteins
and enzymes because of their plasmonic properties, allowing fast detection
of NP aggregation upon color change of dispersions, owing to the plasmonic
coupling.15,16,35,47,49,51

The present work represents a proof-of-principle study for
an enzymatic
colloidal system, based on HRP-coated gold NPs (Figure 1), being capable of catalyzing polymerization
of different monomers, such as N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAAM) and di(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA),
yielding thermosensitive polymers (Figure 2). Furthermore, we show that the Au@HRP NPs
can be recovered almost completely after each polymerization reaction
simply via centrifugation or via sedimentation in case of larger particles
(100 nm Au@HRP NPs) and then be reused in two further (or even more)
successful polymerization cycles. To the best of our knowledge, a
highly stable enzymatic colloidal system, which is capable of multiple
use and facile recovery, based on immobilized enzymes on metal NPs
as a complete new and sustainable approach in the field of polymer
synthesis and colloidal enzymatic catalysis, has not been reported
so far.

Results and Discussion
Enzymatically
(re-)active HRP-coated gold NPs (Au@HRP) of different
sizes as reusable nanobiocatalysts were synthesized by coating the
enzyme directly onto ∼15 and ∼100 nm citrate-stabilized
gold NPs34 (Figures 1 and S1–S5 in the Supporting Information (SI)). Upon enzyme immobilization,
the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the 15 nm NP (Au15@HRP)
dispersions red shifts from 519 to 523.5 nm (Figure 1B) and from 554 to 557.5 nm for the larger
NP (Au100@HRP), owing to refractive index changes in the vicinity
of the NP surface. The occurring redshift of 4.5 nm (3.5 nm for larger
Au100@HRP NPs) and no significant change in color or LSPR band broadening
indicate a successful enzyme coating without any particle aggregation
during the entire coating process. In contrast to the systems reported
in the literature,45,53 the HRP-coated gold NPs (Au@HRP)
were purified from the free enzyme via several purification steps
(i.e., five centrifugation/redispersion cycles).

In accordance
with our previous work on protein and enzyme-coated
NPs,15,16,34,35 the final purified Au@HRP NPs exhibited high colloidal
stability at pH 7.4 (Figure 1B), and the enzyme coating on the gold NPs was very robust
and did not detach from the NP surface during the five purification
cycles (the fifth supernatant shows no enzymatic activity). The HRP
loading was experimentally determined, being ca. 21 HRP molecules
per particle (for 15 nm NPs) and theoretically confirmed, as reported
previously.34 The catalytic activity of
the Au@HRP NPs was checked by the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) in the presence of H2O2 (Figure 1C). TMB is oxidized by the
immobilized HRP in the presence of H2O2, yielding
a blue-colored product (TMB•+) upon one-electron
oxidation and/or a yellow-colored product (tetramethylbenzidine diimine)
upon two-electron oxidation. An exemplary UV–vis spectrum of
the oxidized TMB via Au@HRP NPs is shown in Figure 1C. A detailed and comparative study of the
enzymatic activity parameters, that is, the Michaelis–Menten
constants Vmax and Km, for the catalytic oxidation of TMB for both the immobilized
enzyme (Au@HRP) and the native HRP can be found in our recent publication.34

The Au@HRP NPs were used as a reusable
colloidal nanobiocatalyst
in the polymerization of NIPAAM and DEGMA, yielding thermosensitive
polymers with lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) of 32.5
°C54,55 (PNIPAAM) and 28.0 °C55 (PDEGMA). The successful formation of polymers can be easily
identified at elevated temperatures due to precipitation of insoluble
polymers above their LCST. The reaction conforms to the enzyme/ATRPase-catalyzed
polymerization of such water-soluble monomers, as reported previously
by Bruns et al.6,7

The catalytically (re-)active
Au15@HRP NPs were used as nanobiocatalyst
in the polymerization of NIPAAM and DEGMA under ATRP conditions, in
the presence of sodium ascorbate as reducing agent and 2-hydroxyethyl
2-bromoisobutyrate (HEBIB) as typical ATRP initiator. After the reaction
was quenched by exposing the solution to air, the Au15@HRP NPs were
recovered by centrifugation (60 min, 8000 rcf) and reused in two further
polymerization cycles under the same conditions, as illustrated in Figure 2A. Even after three
polymerization cycles, the Au@HRP NPs remain catalytically active
and retain their colloidal stability as proven by the color of the
NP dispersion (Figure 2, blue-framed cuvette) and the LSPR band, which did not change in
comparison to the as-prepared Au@HRP NPs (red-framed), before the
polymerization reaction. Particle loss in the range of approximately
7–11% was recorded after three polymerization cycles (7.25%
for NIPAAM, 10.75% for DEGMA), which is attributed to the various
centrifugation steps for the recovery. Because both polymers exhibit
an LCST, polymer formation was affirmed after each cycle by inducing
polymer precipitation upon heating the final purified polymer solution
above the respective LCST, which can be observed by the bare eye (Figure 2B).

To gain
further insight into the performance of the Au@HRP NPs
in the polymerization reaction over various cycles, the evolution
of the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution was studied
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The GPC measurements (Figure 3) revealed monomodal
polymer weight distribution for both polymers PNIPAAM and PDEGMA.
Furthermore, their molecular weights (Mn and Mw) and polydispersity indices (PDIs)
are largely constant for the individual three polymerization cycles,
indicating that the catalytic performance of the immobilized HRP molecules
could be maintained during the individual polymerization cycles. The
exact values of Mn, Mw, and PDI are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The results for molecular
weight and PDI vary from the results reported in the literature.6 One possible explanation could be the pH of 7.4
of the reaction medium, which is known to be not optimal for HRP-mediated
reactions,34 including (activators regenerated
by electron transfer) ATRP.6 Nevertheless,
pH for the polymerization mixture was set to 7.4, to ensure colloidal
stability (Figure 2C) of the nanobiocatalyst throughout the reaction.34

Figure 3 GPC results of polymerization of PNIPAAM and PDEGMA for three polymerization
cycles using Au@HRP as nanobiocatalyst (error bars were determined
via standard deviation of the three measurements). Left column shows
the average values of Mn (A), Mw (B), and PDI (C) of PNIPAAM for all three
polymerization cycles. Right column shows the average values of Mn (D), Mw (E), and
PDI (F) of PDEGMA for all three polymerization cycles.

To gain a better insight into the polymerization
reaction, reaction
kinetics via 1H NMR spectroscopy can be followed. However,
for monitoring the kinetics via 1H NMR spectroscopy, a
total volume of 250 μL (which corresponds to 20 mg of specimen)
per NMR sample is required. Because NIPAAM and DEGMA are rather small
monomers (Mw = 113 g/mol for NIPAAM and Mw = 188 g/mol for DEGMA), high amount of monomers
and catalyst (i.e., ca. 20-fold more) would be required to obtain
enough polymer product for a systematic study. However, these upscaling
challenges were avoided by using a macromonomer with a similar chemical
structure, such as poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether acrylate (PEGA, Mw: 480 g/mol). By using a high-molecular-weight
monomer, the requirements of the 1H NMR measurements could
be somewhat fulfilled, without altering the monomer/catalyst ratio
exorbitantly. Although, the Au@HRP NP-catalyzed polymerization of
PEGA shows a linear correlation between reaction time and the negative
natural logarithm of the conversion (for at least the first 5 h, Figure S6 in SI), suggesting that the polymerization
follows a first-order kinetics. This indicates that the Au@HRP NP-catalyzed
polymerization of PEGA follows somewhat the mechanism of a controlled
radical polymerization, which is roughly in accordance with the results
reported by Bruns et al. on pure HRP-mediated ATRP of NIPAAM.6 Also the evolution of Mn and PDI follows roughly the trend in accordance with the
pure HRP-mediated ATRP.6 In view of these
results and the complexity of the system, it becomes clear that reaction
conditions for a controlled polymerization reaction using Au@HRP NPs as colloidal catalysts
have not been found
yet. However, detailed studies with variation of various reaction
parameters, such as the concentration of ingredients, type of ingredients,
and environmental parameters (temperature, pH, buffer, salts), will
be required to indentify the reaction mechanism and eventually achieve
a well-controlled polymerization reaction. These studies are the subject
of ongoing work.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
a simple and straightforward synthesis route
of catalytically active HRP-coated gold nanoparticles that can be
used as a reusable nanobiocatalyst in several polymerization cycles
of vinyl monomers under reaction conditions that are typical for ATRP
reactions. However, the Mw and PDI results
indicate that the polymerization reactions do not follow a controlled
polymerization pathway but rather a free-radical polymerization. Finding
the right conditions for achieving a higher degree of control would
be the focus of the upcoming reports. Nevertheless, the outstanding
characteristic within this system is the simple recovery via centrifugation
and reusability of the Au@HRP over multiple cycles. The colloidal
stability of the enzyme-coated gold NPs was provided throughout the
process, that is, during the enzyme-coating process and the three
subsequent polymerization cycles. Furthermore, we were able to limit
the particle loss down to 7.25% for the three polymerization cycles
of NIPAAM (10.75% for the three polymerization cycles of DEGMA). The
molecular weight and PDI, measured by GPC, of the obtained polymers
show no significant changes within the individual cycles, indicating
that the catalytic activity of the immobilized HRP molecules could
be maintained during all polymerization cycles. In view of these results,
the use of HRP-coated NPs as a reusable colloidal catalyst is highly
feasible in more than just three polymerization cycles. Hence, the
enzyme-coated NPs take the enzyme-catalyzed polymerization reactions
from the regime of homogeneous catalysis to the regime of quasi-homogeneous
catalysis, thus enabling facile separation of the macromolecular catalyst
from the macromolecular product.

powder; Sigma-Aldrich), bovine serum albumin (BSA, ≥98%), N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM, 97%; Sigma-Aldrich), di(ethylene
glycol)methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA, 95%; Sigma-Aldrich), and
poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether acrylate (PEGA, average Mn = 480 g/mol; Sigma-Aldrich) were passed over
aluminum oxide (neutral) prior to use to remove the inhibitor. 2-Hydroxyethyl
2-bromoisobutyrate (HEBIB, 95%; Sigma-Aldrich), (+)-sodium l-ascorbate (crystalline, ≥98%; Sigma-Aldrich), gold(III) chloride
trihydrate (≥99.9% trace metal basis; Sigma-Aldrich), sodium

saline (PBS, tablet; Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (Grüssing
GmbH), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used as received.

Methods
Gel Permeation Chromatography
(GPC)
The apparent number-average
molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) based on polystyrene
standards and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the yielded polymers
were determined by GPC. Measurements of PNIPAAM, PDEGMA, and PEGA
were performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity series equipped with an
autosampler, a diode array detector, and a refractive index detector.
They were measured with a precolumn (GRAM 10 μm (8.0 ×
50 mm2)) and two main columns (GRAM 10 μm, 100 Å
(8.0 × 300 mm2) and GRAM 10 μm, 3000 Å
(8.0 × 300 mm2)) thermostatted to room temperature,
using dimethylformamide (DMF, +5 g/L lithium bromide) as the mobile
phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column setup was provided
by Polymer Standards Service GmbH. GPC samples were prepared by dissolving
the lyophilized polymer in DMF (polymer’s concentration amounts
to 2 mg/mL). After
homogenization overnight, 20 μL of the samples was injected
into the GPC device. The measurement time was 65 min.

1H NMR
1H NMR spectroscopy was
carried out with a Bruker Avance 300 (300 MHz) instrument. All measurements
were performed at room temperature using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide
as solvent.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis
spectra were
acquired with a Specord Plus 250 (Analytik Jena) spectrophotometer.
For measurements, 1.5 mL of the corresponding solution was placed
in a cell and spectral analysis was performed in the 300–1100
nm range at room temperature.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
The average
size, distribution, and morphology of citrate-stabilized AuNP and
HRP-coated AuNP before and after every polymerization cycle were analyzed
by TEM using a LEO 922 A EFTEM microscope (OMEGA). TEM samples were
prepared by placing one drop of diluted aqueous dispersion of AuNP
in a carbon-coated copper grid and allowing the solvent to evaporate
at room temperature. The average particle diameter and distribution
were determined by evaluating at least 300 individual particles using
the software ImageJ.

Preparation of 15 nm Gold Nanoparticles (Au15@citrate)
Gold NPs of about 15 nm in size were prepared by the citrate reduction
method.56 In a typical procedure, 750 mL
of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 solution was put in an Erlenmeyer flask
and heated to boiling. Under vigorous stirring, 18 mL of a 1 wt %
citrate solution was added, resulting in a color change
of the solution from a grayish-blue to deep wine-red within 10 min.
Now the heating is stopped and the solution cools down with stirring
overnight. The resulting Au15@citrate was stored at 4 °C.

Preparation
of 100 nm Gold Nanoparticles (Au100@Citrate)
Quasi-spherical
citrate-stabilized AuNPs with an average particle
size of ∼100 nm were synthesized by the citrate reduction-based
seeded growth method developed by Puntes et al.57 In a 250 mL three-neck round-bottom flask, 150 mL of a
2.2 mM aqueous solution of sodium citrate was heated in an oil bath
for 15 min under reflux and vigorous stirring at permanent control
of the solution temperature. At 100 °C, 1 mL of a 25 mM HAuCl4 solution was immediately injected, by which the color of
the solution changed from yellow to bluish-gray and then to soft pink
within 10 min. The resulting citrate-stabilized AuNPs were used as
seeds for the next seeded growth steps by successive addition of Au
precursor, citrate solution, Milli-Q water, and dilution steps as
reported elsewhere.57 After 11 consecutive
growth steps, citrate-stabilized 100 nm AuNPs were obtained. The resulting
NPs were stored at 4 °C.

Immobilization of HRP onto
Gold Nanoparticles
For preparation
of an HRP solution, 2 mg of HRP is dissolved in 10 mL of a 0.1 wt
% citrate solution. Subsequently, 90 mL of a filtered (Nylon, 0.1
μm) particle solution (9.1 × 10–5 M,
pH = 9) is added dropwise under stirring to the protein solution (final
HRP concentration of 0.02 mg/mL). The protein/particle solution is
stirred overnight and afterward purified by five centrifugation steps
(60 min, 8000 rcf; 4 °C). After every centrifugation step, the
gold NPs are redispersed in basic water (pH = 9). The supernatant
of the fifth centrifugation cycle was checked on enzymatic activity
and enzyme desorption from the NPs surface via TMB oxidation.

Activity
Measurements of Au15@HRP
Activity measurements
of Au@HRP NPs were performed following the procedures reported elsewhere.34

ATRP of NIPAAM and DEGMA Using Au15@HRP as
Nanobiocatalyst
The polymerization was carried out in 100
mM PBS solution at pH
7.4. HEBIB (2.4 μL, 3.5 mg, 16.5 μmol) and monomer (NIPAAM:
127.5 mg, 1.127 mmol; DEGMA: 121.1 mg, 207.9 μL, 1.127 mmol;
NIPAAM was used as received; DEGMA was passed over aluminum oxide
(neutral) prior to use to remove the inhibitor) were weighed in a
flask and dissolved in 3.75 mL of PBS buffer. In two separate flasks,
sodium ascorbate (7.5 mg, 37.9 μmol) was dissolved in 2.5 mL
of PBS buffer and 1 mL of an HRP-coated gold NP solution ([Au0] = 4 mM) was weighed. Au15@HRP was obtained from a stock
solution, and its concentration was measured via UV–vis spectroscopy.
Oxygen was removed from all three flasks by purging the solutions
with nitrogen for 20–30 min. The monomer/initiator mixture
(750 μL) was syringed to the gold NP solution and then the polymerization
was started by transferring 250 μL of the reducing agent solution
into the Au15@HRP/NIPAAM/HEBIB solution in the vial by means of a
syringe. The ratio of reactants in the reaction mixture was 1/68/1.1/1212
(HEBIB/monomer/sodium ascorbate/Au15@HRP (# NPs)). The reaction was
stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere for 2.5 h. Subsequently,
the polymerization was quenched by exposing the reaction to air, and
the Au15@HRP NPs were removed from the solution by several centrifugation
steps (60 min, 8000 rcf). After every centrifugation cycle, the Au15@HRP
NPs were rinsed with PBS. The recovered gold NPs were used in two
further polymerization cycles under the same conditions. The successful
polymer formation can be easily confirmed due to precipitation of
insoluble polymer above its LCST. Molecular weight and PDI of the
polymer chains were investigated with GPC. Every data point was calculated
out of three individual polymerizations. The uncertainty of the GPC
device was in the range of 12–12.9%.

Polymerization of PEGA
Using Au15@HRP as Nanobiocatalyst
The polymerization of PEGA
using Au15@HRP as biocatalyst was carried
out analogously to the polymerization of NIPAAM and DEGMA. HEBIB (4.19
μL, 6.1 mg, 28.89 μmol) and PEGA (1.08 g, 0.992 mL, 2.25
mmol, PEGA was passed over aluminum oxide (neutral) prior to use to
remove the inhibitor) were weighed in a flask and dissolved in 3.0
mL of PBS buffer (pH = 7.4). In two separate flasks, sodium ascorbate
(1.73 mg, 158.3 μmol) was dissolved in 2.5 mL of PBS buffer
(pH = 7.4) and 2 mL of an Au15@HRP solution ([Au0] = 4
mM) was weighed. Oxygen was removed from all three flasks by purging
the solutions with nitrogen for 30 min. The monomer/initiator mixture
(2.5 mL) was syringed to the AuNP solution. Subsequently, polymerization
was started by transferring 1 mL of the reducing agent solution into
the Au15@HRP/PEGA/HEBIB solution by means of a syringe. The ratio
of the reactants was 1/79/1.4/332 (HEBIB/PEGA/sodium ascorbate/Au15@HRP).
Samples (250 μL) were taken in periodical time intervals to
track the conversion rate via 1H NMR spectroscopy.
