Chemical exfoliation
approaches such as Li-intercalation for the
production of two-dimensional MoS2 are highly attractive
due to their high yield of monolayer forms, cost-effectiveness, and
mass-scalability. However, the loss of the semiconducting property
and poor dispersion stability in solvent have limited the extent of
their potential applications. Here, we report simultaneous phase recovery
and surface functionalization for the preparation of a highly stable
2H-MoS2 dispersion in water. This study shows that high-yield
restoration of the semiconducting 2H phase from a chemically exfoliated
MoS2 (ce-MoS2) can be induced by a mild-temperature
(180 °C) solvent thermal treatment in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP). In addition to a phase
transition, this solvent thermal treatment in NMP realizes concurrent
surface functionalization of the 2H-MoS2 surface, which
provides an outstanding dispersion stability to 2H-MoS2 in water for more than 10 months. Finally, we report the humidity
sensor based on the functionalized 2H-MoS2, which shows
a substantial response enhancement compared with a nonfunctionalized
2H-MoS2 or ce-MoS2.

Introduction
Over the past several
years, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received a large amount of attention due
to their unique electrical, optical, and chemical characteristics
compared with their bulk forms.1−3 In particular, molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2), which is the most widely investigated semiconducting
TMD, is considered a potential substitute of Si for future electronics
and optoelectronic devices due to its atomically thin nature and excellent
performance such as a high on/off ratio (108), a large
carrier mobility (200–500 cm2/V s), and a steep
subthreshold swing (70 mV/dec)1,4−6 as an active channel layer for field-effect transistors.

Various
exfoliation methods for separating stacked layers of bulk
MoS2 to prepare its 2D forms have been developed. Although
mechanical exfoliation can produce a high-quality MoS2 with minimal defects,7−9 extremely low throughput/yield,
a limited flake size, and poor thickness control prevent its use for
large-scale manufacturing. Thus, massive efforts have been devoted
to develop a new method for producing a mass-scale and solution-processible
exfoliated MoS2 through chemical approaches.7,10−13 Among them, liquid-phase exfoliation in an appropriate solvent assisted
by ultrasonication with or without a stabilizer and ion-intercalation
method has been established. In particular, lithium-based intercalation
is one of the most practical route due to the high yield of the monolayer
MoS2 and mass productivity; meanwhile, the exfoliated MoS2 processed using the ultrasonication-assisted liquid exfoliation
contains a high fraction of thick MoS2 even over nine layers.8,14−19

Li-intercalation is a promising route for the mass production
of
high-quality monolayer MoS2. However, several challenges
still remain, although some of the issues of this method have been
overcome by ammonia/amine intercalation.20,21 Typically, during a lithiation process, MoS2 experiences
loss of its semiconducting property caused by the structural phase
transition from 2H (semiconductor) to 1T phase (metal).14,18,22−26 This 1T phase is known as a metastable phase, and
thus the 1T phase can be recovered to the 2H phase by annealing at
high temperature typically over 300 °C. Eda and co-workers first
reported the successful restoration of the semiconducting property
of MoS2 via annealing after lithiation.14 They systematically studied the phase restoration phenomenon
with an elevation of the temperature above 100 °C and confirmed
that the restoration to the 2H phase reached ∼100% at 300 °C.
However, this annealing process was conducted on a substrate after
forming a MoS2 thin film by a casting process, which has
associated challenges related to the device stability because such
high annealing temperature can result in thermal damage to other components
in devices such as flexible substrate or organic semiconductor. Therefore,
to widely extend the applicability of the semiconducting MoS2, it is necessary to develop a solution-phase restoration process.
Furthermore, poor dispersion stability of the resultant Li-intercalated
MoS2 upon restacking of the exfoliated MoS2 due
to strong van der Waals interactions is a critical issue.27−30 To improve the dispersion stability and avoidance of restacking,
proper functionalization of the monolayer 2H-MoS2 surface
is essential.31−33 However, most functionalization methods are mainly
focused on 1T-MoS2, and it is still challenging to produce
a uniformly functionalized monolayer 2H-MoS2 with sufficient
solution stability.

Here, we demonstrate the one-step preparation
of a highly stable
2H-MoS2 dispersion via solvent thermal treatment in polar
solvents using Li-intercalated MoS2. During solvent thermal
treatment under mild temperature (180 °C), efficient restoration
of the 2H phase is accomplished with an approximately 85% conversion
ratio from 1T-MoS2 obtained from a Li-intercalation method.
Notably, when the solvent thermal treatment was conducted in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 2H-MoS2 can be
functionalized simultaneously, providing an outstanding long-term
stability of a concentrated aqueous dispersion for over 10 months.
Moreover, the functionalized 2H-MoS2, which has a high
water absorption capability, presents a high sensitivity to humidity,
realizing a humidity sensor with an outstanding response activity
that is several times higher than that of the original 1T-MoS2 prepared by Li-intercalation method.

Results
The overall
process for the preparation of a highly stable 2H-MoS2 dispersion
is illustrated in Figure 1a. First, few and monolayer MoS2 nanosheets were
prepared from the chemical exfoliation of bulk MoS2 via
the Li-intercalation method14,22,26 (see Experimental Section for details).
After complete washing of the samples to remove the
remaining Li ions, the obtained chemically exfoliated MoS2 (ce-MoS2 with majority 1T phase) was transferred to the
following polar solvents with a sufficiently high boiling point and
suitable dispersion capability for MoS2: ethylene glycol
(EG), formamide (FA), propylene carbonate (PC), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether
(TGDE), and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). During the transfer procedure,
the resultant ce-MoS2 should be in a wet-clay state with
a small quantity of water to prevent the restacking of MoS2 sheets.3,34 A homogeneous dispersion and dispersion
stability within polar solvents are also important for avoiding the
agglomeration of ce-MoS2 during the solvent thermal treatment.
Thus, after ultrasonication for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous MoS2 dispersion in each polar solvent, the dispersions were kept
for 1 week to investigate their stability. Based on this result, EG,
FA, PC, NMP, and DMSO were chosen as appropriate solvent media for
the solvent thermal treatment (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 1 Schematic of one-step phase recovery and
surface functionalization
using solvent thermal treatment. (a) Overall process for the preparation
of a highly stable 2H-MoS2 dispersion. To chemically exfoliate
the MoS2 to a monolayer level, solution-based Li-intercalation
using n-butyl lithium was conducted. The resultant
ce-MoS2 was solvent thermal treated in various solvents
such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). (b) Photographs
showing the dispersion stability of 2H-MoS2 (annealed in
NMP) in water after 10 months.

Previously, several studies have reported that the thermally
driven
phase transition from 1T to 2H phase was about 100% when the temperature
was elevated up to 300 °C.14,22,33 However, structural and chemical defects such as sulfur vacancies,
triangular etch pits, and oxidation of MoS2 were inevitable
at such high temperature22,35−38 (about 300 °C). Moreover, it should be noted that the majority
(about 80%) of the phase transition has already occurred at 150 °C.14,22 Thus, in this study, the thermal treatment was conducted at a relatively
low temperature (180 °C) to minimize the formation of structural
and chemical defects and to prevent the boiling of the solvent. During
the solvent thermal treatment at 180 °C for 5 h, we observed
the structural phase transition from 1T (metal) to 2H (semiconductor)
phase. In addition, when the solvent thermal treatment was conducted
in NMP, the resultant 2H-MoS2 (MoS2–NMP)
dispersion showed high stability in the aqueous solvent, as shown
in Figure 1b.

To investigate the phase transition in MoS2, an X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted before and
after the solvent thermal treatment. All of the XPS spectra were calibrated
with reference to the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV to compensate for the
charging effect. As depicted in Figure 2a, the XPS spectra of Mo 3d consist of three sets of
peaks: (i) MoO3 peaks (yellow line), which can be deconvoluted
into Mo6+ doublets 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 located at 232.6 and 235.3 eV, respectively; (ii) the Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 of 1T-MoS2 peaks (blue line) located at 228.2 and 231.3 eV, respectively,
and (iii) the Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 of 2H-MoS2 peaks (red line) located
at 229.0 and 232.1 eV, respectively.14,22,39,40 The ce-MoS2 was identified to be metallic 1T phase (71.37%) partially mixed
with oxidized MoS2 (11.35%) (Figure 2a), which is consistent with the findings
of previous studies.18,22 After the solvent thermal treatment
in each polar solvent, the Mo 3d spectra were shifted toward the higher
binding energy side because the Mo 3d peaks of 2H-MoS2 were
intensified, as shown in Figure 2a. The ratio of each phase was calculated from the
sum of the total area of each peak except the peak of the MoO3 phase, as presented in Figure 2b. (These data are also provided in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.) In addition, the
O 1s spectrum also supports the quantitative analysis results of the
MoO3 phase except the MoS2–NMP sample
containing C=O groups, as shown in Figure S2.

ce-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 after the solvent thermal
treatment in each polar solvent at 180 °C for 5 h. Deconvoluted
red and blue lines represent the 2H-MoS2 and 1T-MoS2, respectively. The MoO3 peaks (yellow line) and
S peaks (brown line) are also shown after deconvolution. (b) Calculated
2H phase and MoO3 ratio from Mo 3d XPS analysis results

electron microscopy (TEM) images obtained before and after the solvent
thermal treatment. (Mo atom—green dot, S atom—yellow
dot). (e) Extinction spectra of ce-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 after the solvent thermal treatment in each polar solvent.
The A and B exciton peaks, which are located at 657.01 and 607.77
nm, respectively, originate from the monolayer MoS2.

For ce-MoS2, the 1T
phase was dominant and the fraction
of 2H phase was only about ∼30%. After the solvent thermal
treatment, however, the 1T phase was restored to the 2H phase and
the 2H phase ratio reached about 80% for all of the polar solvents
used for the treatment. Similarly, the phase transition from 1T to
2H was also observed in the S 2p XPS spectra after the solvent thermal
treatment, as depicted in Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information. From the S 2p spectra, the 2H phase ratio
was calculated to be approximately 85% for all of the polar solvents
used (Table S1 in the Supporting Information),
which is consistent with the calculation results based on the Mo XPS
peaks.

Moreover, the Raman spectra of the ce-MoS2 and MoS2–NMP were compared, as shown in Figure S4, for a more in-depth characterization
of the MoS2 nanosheets.40 The
Raman spectra
from ce-MoS2 show several bands, J1, J2, J3, E1g, E2g, and A1g, indicating the 1T-phase MoS2, whereas only E2g and A1g peaks were observed for MoS2–NMP,
confirming that it is the 2H phase. The spectrum for MoS2–NMP shows peaks at 385 and 407 cm–1. Also,
from the difference (22.3 ± 1.49 cm–1) of E2g and A1g Raman peak positions, the average number
of layers was calculated to be slightly over 2, which is consistent
with the AFM measurement results shown in Figure S5.

Furthermore, the phase transition from 1T to 2H was
identified
by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM)
images, as depicted in Figure 2c,d. In the high-angle annular dark-field STEM image, the
ce-MoS2 only reveals hexagonally oriented Mo atoms because
the MoS2 was reconstructed to an ABC (S–Mo–S′)
sequence stack and, as a result, the lattice points of S atoms were
distorted.41,42 After the solvent thermal treatment,
the hexagonally arranged S atoms appeared between Mo atoms due to
the restoration of the MoS2 structure to an ABA (S–Mo–S)
sequence stack.22,41−43

Interestingly,
when the solvent thermal treatment was conducted
in NMP, the 2H phase ratio showed the highest value and the fraction
of MoO3 was lowest (6.44%) among all of the samples, which
is similar to the MoO3 fraction in natural bulk MoS2. This can be related to the fact that NMP is also a useful
reduction agent for deoxygenating of other 2D materials such as graphene
oxide due to its oxygen-scavenging property,44 and thus these results may originate from the combination of thermal
and chemical deoxygenating effects during the solvent thermal treatment.
(This will be discussed in detail later.) The recovery from 1T to
2H phase by the solvent thermal treatment is further supported by
the re-emergence of the A and B extinction peaks in the UV–vis
absorption measurement results shown in Figure 2e. As presented in Figure 2e, no extinction peaks were observed in the
extinction spectra of ce-MoS2 within the wavelength range
of 550–750 nm due to the dominance of the 1T phase. After the
solvent thermal treatment, however, the A and B extinction peaks appeared
for the samples treated in all of the polar solvents. The A and B
extinction peaks, which are located at 657.01 and 607.77 nm,14,45 respectively, originated from the monolayer 2H-MoS2.

Notably, the extinction peaks of the sample annealed in NMP were
almost identical to the A and B extinction peaks of pure monolayer
MoS2, whereas those of other 2H-MoS2 were slightly
red-shifted. (Individual peak positions are presented in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.)

Considering that the band gap of MoS2 decreases with
increasing thickness of MoS2, these extinction data strongly
suggest that the resultant 2H-MoS2 in EG, FA, DMSO, and
PC were at least partially agglomerated and thickened during the solvent
thermal treatment, whereas few or monolayer MoS2 flakes
in NMP were preserved without agglomeration. In addition, to quantify
the average number of atomic layers in the MoS2 flakes,
an atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis on the samples was conducted,
as shown in Figure S5. MoS2–NMP
sheets with an average diameter of 207.9 ± 82.7 nm can be clearly
observed in the AFM images. A typical height of 1.2–1.4 nm
was obtained using the AFM line profiles and the average number of
layers in the flake samples was calculated to be 2.38 ± 0.92,
confirming that mono- to few-layer MoS2–NMP was
successfully preserved. These results are consistent with the Raman
analysis results (Figure S4). Moreover,
even after the long-term storage of MoS2–NMP for
10 months, the average diameter was maintained at 218.9 ± 85.7
nm (Figure S6). This is in contrast with
the coagulation of MoS2 nanosheets reported previously.46

These observations imply the change in
the surface chemistry of
MoS2 during the solvent thermal treatment using NMP. As
depicted in panel (a), the deconvoluted C 1s XPS spectra indicate
the formation of C=O and C–N bonds in MoS2–NMP, which were not present in ce-MoS2. (The XPS
spectra were acquired after fully washing the flakes with EtOH, acetone,
and deionized (DI) water.) We also checked the N 1s spectra (Figure 3b), where the Mo4+ 3p3/2 and Mo6+ 3p3/2 peaks
partially overlapped with the N 1s peak. The change in the XPS spectra
indicates that, after the solvent thermal treatment in NMP, Mo–N
bonding was formed and the fraction of Mo6+ 3p3/2 (from MoO3) decreased from 11.3 to 7.2%. This result
is consistent with the XPS analysis results of the Mo 3d peaks shown
in Figure 2a and indicates
the reduction of MoS2 during the solvent thermal treatment
in NMP. Due to the oxygen-scavenging property of NMP during the solvent
thermal treatment, NMP can be partially oxidized or decomposed to
organic compounds containing an amide group such as N-ethylacetamide, N-methylformamide, or acetamide,46 which is implied by the color change of NMP
from colorless to brown, as shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. It should be noted that these species
can be chemisorbed to the surface MoS2. Figure 3b shows that the N 1s XPS spectrum
of the solvent-thermal-treated MoS2 in NMP has a noticeable
shoulder peak at around 400 eV, which is known to be related to the
Mo–N bond.47−49

(EDS) mapping of Mo, S, C, N, and O on the surface of (c) ce-MoS2 and (d) MoS2–NMP. Scale bar: 500 nm.

Furthermore, we also investigated
the C 1s XPS spectra for the
samples obtained with other polar solvents (EG, FA, PC, and DMSO).
As shown in Figure S8, the overall C 1s
peaks were similar to that of ce-MoS2. This result means
that the surface functionalization of MoS2 did not take
place in other solvents, which may explain the agglomeration of MoS2 during the solvent thermal treatment. In addition to the
XPS results, we also investigated the TEM images and the corresponding
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping for Mo, S, and
N elements on ce-MoS2 and MoS2–NMP. As
shown in Figure 3c,
the EDS mapping results of ce-MoS2 show the presence of
only Mo and S, whereas the EDS results of MoS2–NMP
additionally present well-distributed C, O, and N elements (Figure 3d). This result also
supports the finding that the MoS2–NMP was uniformly
functionalized after the solvent thermal treatment in NMP, although
additional agents were not added to the solvent.

To further
investigate the surface functionalization of MoS2–NMP,
an attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis was performed and the results are shown
in Figure 4a. After
the solvent thermal treatment in NMP, we observed the appearance of
strong peaks at 3423, 2917, 2846, 1702, 1433, and 1374 cm–1, which represent the N–H, C–H, C=O, and C–N
bonds, respectively. As shown in Figure S9, these peaks and the overall FTIR spectra of MoS2–NMP
are well matched with those of acetamide.

MoS2. (a) FTIR spectra

peaks appeared at 1433, 1708, and 2924 cm–1 after
the solvent thermal treatment. (b) NMR analysis data. 13C NMR cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning (CP-MAS) spectra of

corresponding to carbonyls and the blue point indicates α-C
signals. (c) Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) results and (d) X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of ce-MoS2 and MoS2–NMP.

The surface-attached
molecule was also characterized using the
solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning
nuclear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS NMR) spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 4b, the NMR spectra
for pure acetamide (black) show characteristic chemical shifts (δ)
corresponding to carbonyl and aliphatic carbons (α-C in this
case) at 179.9 and 25.7 ppm, which are marked with green and blue
points, respectively. In the case of MoS2–NMP (blue),
the peaks corresponding to both α-C (blue) at 173.5 ppm and
carbonyl C (green) at 34.5 ppm, which are comparable with those of
pure acetamide. The broad peak at 130.3 ppm was also observed for
the nonfunctionalized bulk 2H-MoS2 (red), suggesting the
peak is not related to the surface-functionalized layer. Overall,
these NMR, FTIR, TEM, and XPS analysis results confirm that the ce-MoS2 was restored to 2H-MoS2 and simultaneously functionalized
with acetamide during the solvent thermal treatment in NMP.

The amount of absorbed molecules was characterized by a thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) after completely drying the samples. Figure 4c shows the TGA weight loss
curves of ce-MoS2 and MoS2–NMP measured
from room temperature to 700 °C under an air atmosphere. The
weight loss until 300 °C, which is caused by the evaporation
of the adsorbed water molecules, was measured to be 2.15 and 3.68%
for ce-MoS2 and MoS2–NMP, respectively.
In the temperature range from 300 to 500 °C, a major weight loss
of 14.35% occurred for ce-MoS2, which can be explained
by the replacement of S by O due to the oxidation of MoS2 to MoO3. Overall, a comparison of the TGA curve of ce-MoS2 with that of MoS2–NMP indicates that the
additional weight loss of MoS2–NMP of about 10%
is due to the decomposition of acetamide attached on MoS2. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were conducted
to confirm the interlayer spacing (Figure 4d). In ce-MoS2, we observed the
sharp peak at 2θ = 14.06°, which corresponds to (002) planes
of the Li-intercalated MoS2. In the case of MoS2–NMP, however, the (002) peak was found to be shifted to a
significantly lower angle at 2θ = 9.04°. This result reveals
that the expansion of the lattice spacing along the c axis from 0.629 nm (ce-MoS2) to 0.974 nm (MoS2–NMP) is due to acetamide molecules attached on MoS2.13

We investigated the long-term
stability of the various aqueous
dispersions of solvent-thermal-treated MoS2. The concentration
of MoS2 in the dispersions was estimated using the Beer–Lambert
law, A = αCl, where A is the measured absorbance at a particular wavelength,
α is the extinction coefficient, C is the concentration
of the dispersion, and l is the thickness of the
solution layer.10,19 We first obtained the extinction
coefficient (at λ = 672 nm) of each sample by fitting the slope
of A/l as a function of MoS2 concentration (Figure S10 in the
Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S10, similar concentrations of MoS2 dispersions with 0.75
mg/mL were then prepared, and the absorbance of MoS2 aqueous
dispersion was monitored regularly during 50 days. To enhance the
accuracy of this measurement, all of the MoS2 dispersions
were diluted 50-fold before the measurement to minimize the light-scattering
effect. As shown in Figure 5a, the MoS2–NMP aqueous dispersion showed
a superior long-term dispersion stability compared with other dispersion
samples. However, during the early-stage storage up to 1 week, ce-MoS2 and the solvent-thermal-treated MoS2 in EG (MoS2–EG) presented a stable dispersion state, the absorbance
of ce-MoS2 in the supernatant was sharply reduced and reached
almost 0 within 20 days, which can be attributed to the fact that
the negative surface charge resulting from the Li-intercalation was
gradually transferred to the water molecules.50 Other aqueous dispersions obtained by the solvent thermal treatment
in EG, PC, FA, and DMSO also showed poor dispersion stability, and
a significant portion of MoS2 was precipitated before 20
days, whereas the aqueous dispersions containing MoS2–NMP
were still stable even after 50 days. The absorbance of dispersed
MoS2–NMP (0.2337) is about 39.0 and 16.5 times higher
than that of the dispersed ce-MoS2 (0.006) and MoS2–EG (0.0142) after 50 days, respectively. Additional
analysis data regarding the dispersion properties of the samples are
provided in Figure S10 and Table S3. A
photograph of highly stable MoS2–NMP is depicted
in Figure 5b.

dispersion. (a) Absorbance of 2H-MoS2 in the supernatant

of MoS2–NMP shows a superior long-term dispersion
stability compared with the other dispersions due to the hydrophilic
acetamide surface functionalization. (b) Photographs of MoS2 dispersions as prepared and after 50 days.

The outstanding dispersion stability of the MoS2–NMP
nanosheets is consistent with the measured ζ potential values
(Table S4 in the Supporting Information).
The ζ potential of the chemically exfoliated nanosheets of MoS2 containing a large fraction of 1T phase was −43.1
mV due to excess surface charge.33,50,51 In general, the surface of bare 2H-MoS2 is not charged, and therefore it cannot be stabilized in common
organic solvents because of a low ζ potential (−20.2
mV).24,33 However, the ζ potential (−41.2
mV) of the MoS2–NMP functionalized with polar molecules
was sufficiently high and can explain the good dispersion stability
in water.51,52

Considering the dispersion stability
in an aqueous solvent (Figure 5), it is expected
that the resultant MoS2 after the solvent thermal treatment
in polar solvents will have a different surface hydrophilicity. We
compared the water contact angle (WCA) of ce-MoS2, MoS2–EG (without functional group), and MoS2–NMP (with acetamide functional group). As shown in Figure S11a, the WCAs were 34.63° for ce-MoS2 and 71.96° for MoS2–EG. These WCAs
of ce-MoS2 and MoS2–EG are comparable
with the recently reported values of Li-intercalated 1T-MoS2 and mechanically exfoliated 2H-MoS2 from bulk.18,53 The substantially lower WCA (20.21°) of MoS2–NMP
than that of other samples indicates that the MoS2–NMP
has a much higher hydrophilicity, which is consistent with the outstanding
dispersion stability in water.

The greater water affinity of
MoS2–NMP suggests
its potential application to humidity sensor devices. We fabricated
a resistance-type humidity sensor using an interdigitated electrode
with 4 μm channel width by drop-casting of MoS2–NMP
(Figure 6a) to investigate
the humidity-sensing properties (see the Experimental
Section for details). As shown in Figure 6b, we observed a remarkably different response
behavior depending on the functionalization at 80 relative humidity
(RH)%. The response of the sensor was calculated by RH/Ro, where RH is the resistance value in the presence of humidity
and Ro is the resistance value when dry
air was passed through the chamber. ce-MoS2 and MoS2–EG show a positive response (increase in resistance),
and the response of MoS2–EG was higher than that
of ce-MoS2 due to the transition from 1T (metal) to 2H
(semiconductor) phase. In contrast, the response of MoS2–NMP shows a negative response (decrease in resistance) and
its response was much higher than that of other devices. This result
can be attributed to the difference in water affinity and the hydrogen
bond formation between the carbonyl group and water molecules (Figure 6a, right), as already
reported.54 The sensor performance was
further characterized by adjusting the humidity from 25 to 95 RH%,
and the corresponding responses of the three sensors are shown in Figure 6c. Different sensing
behaviors depending on functionalization were also detected over the
whole range of humidity. The response of ce-MoS2 and MoS2–EG increased linearly with increasing humidity levels.
However, MoS2–NMP shows a more rapid increase in
response with increasing humidity levels due to hydrophilic functionalization.
The sensitivity of MoS2–NMP was 5 times higher than
that of ce-MoS2 at 95 RH% (Figure S11b in the Supporting Information). These results indicate that an appropriate
modification of MoS2 surface combined with a phase transition

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated a practical method for a high-yield
phase transition from 1T to 2H phase and simultaneous functionalization
of MoS2 via the solvent thermal treatment in a polar solvent.
We found that the solvent thermal treatment in a polar solvent at
a mild temperature (180 °C) is appropriate for restoration from
1T (metal) to 2H (semiconductor) phase. In particular, solvent thermal
treatment of MoS2 in NMP was simultaneously and uniformly
functionalized with acetamide—a thermal decomposition product
of NMP, which was confirmed on the basis of XPS, FTIR, NMR, TGA, and
XRD analysis results. This surface functionalization by hydrophilic
molecules can provide an excellent dispersion stability of 2H-MoS2 in water for more than 10 months. Finally, the humidity sensor
fabricated using MoS2–NMP showed an outstanding
sensing response in a wide relative humidity range compared with nonfunctionalized
samples due to the water affinity of acetamide molecules. We expect
that this strategy can also be applied to other 2D materials to precisely
control their phases and surface properties, and thereby tailor their
fundamental properties and extend the application areas.

Experimental
Section
Materials
MoS2 powder (∼6 μm)
was purchased from 2D Semiconductor, Inc. A 1.6 M n-butyl lithium solution, ethylene glycol (EG), formamide (FA), propylene
carbonate (PC), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), tetraethylene
glycol dimethyl ether (TGDE), and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the chemicals were used as purchased
without any further purification.

Preparation of MoS2 Nanosheets
MoS2 nanosheets were prepared
using the lithium-intercalation/exfoliation
method. First, the MoS2 powders were immersed in 1.6 M n-butyl lithium solution (0.1 g/mL) and stirred for 48 h
in a N2-filled glovebox at 60 °C. The Li-intercalated
MoS2 (LixMoS2) was
filtered and washed repeatedly with hexane to remove excess lithium
and organic residues. The collected LixMoS2 powder was then dispersed in deionized (DI) water
(18.3 MΩ). Upon contact with water, the evolution of gas was
observed and the MoS2 powder formed a highly opaque suspension.
Subsequently, LixMoS2 was exfoliated
via bath ultrasonication (200 W, JAC Ultrasonics 2010; KODO Technical
Research Co., Ltd.) for 90 min. After exfoliation, the suspension
was centrifuged several times (five to six times) at 14 000
rpm for 1 h with DI water to remove LiOH and unexfoliated MoS2. This washing process was completed until the pH of the solution
reached a neutral value.

Solvent Thermal Treatment
The purified
wet sediment
was dispersed in several polar solvents with a high boiling point
such as ethylene glycol, formamide, propylene carbonate, dimethyl
sulfoxide, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, hexamethylphosphoramide,
and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. MoS2 dispersions
in polar solvents were sonicated for 30 min to produce a homogeneous
solution before the solvent thermal treatment. After sonication, the
MoS2 dispersion was transferred to a two-neck flask and
refluxed at 300 rpm under an Ar flow. A heating mantle was used to
heat the MoS2 dispersion up to 180 °C for 15 min and
the temperature was maintained for 5 h without boiling over. The resultant
suspension was filtered over a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane
(0.2 μm, JGWP04700; Millipore) and rinsed several times with
ethanol, acetone, and DI water. The obtained product was redispersed
into the aqueous solvent via bath sonication for 30 min. Finally,
the MoS2 dispersion was centrifuged with a low rpm (2000
rpm, 5 min; 1000 rpm, 10 min) to remove the agglomeration of MoS2 during the solvent thermal treatment.

Characterization of Phase
Transition and Functionalization of
MoS2
For confirming the phase transition, an X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted using a multipurpose
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Sigma Probe; Thermo VG Scientific).
The absorbance of the MoS2 dispersion was measured by a
UV–vis spectrophotometer (Optizen POP; Mecasys). The FTIR spectra
were collected with an attenuated total reflectance FT-infrared spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR, ALPHA-P; Bruker) in the range from 500 to 4000 cm–1. High-resolution-TEM images and EDS mapping were obtained using
a double Cs-corrected Titan TEM (Titan G2 60–300; FEI) with
80 kV accelerating voltage and a 200 kV TEM (JEM-2100F; JEOL), respectively.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out using a multipurpose
thin-film X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2500; Rigaku) and weight loss
was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Setsys 16/18; Setaram
Instrumentation). The AFM characterization was conducted in a noncontact
mode using the atomic force microscope (AFM) from Asylum Research
Cypher. The solid-state 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were
measured using an Agilent 9.4 T (400 MHz 1H NMR frequency)
spectrometer with a 1.6 mm magic-angle spinning (MAS) probe. All of
the reported chemical shifts were referenced to adamantane at 298
K. For cross-polarization (CP) MAS, 13C{1H}
NMR spectra were attained with 8 h of signal averaging at 20 kHz MAS,
with a constant 50 kHz radio frequency field strength applied to the 13C NMR channel during the 1H–13C NMR CP (contact time of 3 ms).

Stability Test of MoS2 Aqueous Dispersion
We first fabricated each MoS2 dispersion with the saturation
state and then the absorbance of each MoS2 dispersion was
measured with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Optizen POP; Mecasys)
with a 1 cm path cuvette after 24 h to exclude the aggregated MoS2. To obtain the concentration of each MoS2 dispersion,
we used the Lambert–Beer law. The concentration changes were
monitored during 50 days. To enhance the accuracy, all of the MoS2 dispersions were measured after dilution to obtain the absorbance
below 1. ζ Potentials of the samples were measured using Malvern
Instrument zeta sizer Nano-ZS at pH ≈ 7.4. The samples were
prepared as follows: the representative solid sample (1 mg) was first
dispersed in DI water (10 mL) and sonicated for 30 min. One milliliter
of that solution was taken out and put into the ζ potential
cell for the measurement of ζ potential. The values are reported
as an average of three measurements.

Fabrication and Measurement
of Humidity Sensor
Water
contact angles (WCAs) were obtained by a dynamic contact angle meter
(Phoenix 300; SEO) equipped with a digital camera. To fabricate a
interdigitated electrode with 4 μm width on a Si wafer, we used
a typical photolithography with AZ5142E photoresist and a mask aligner
(MDA-8000B). After the development of the patterns, Au with a thickness
of 100 nm was deposited as a source and drained by thermal evaporation.
The MoS2 dispersion was then drop-cast on the electrode
patterns. The electrical characteristics of the sensors were measured
by a digital multimeter (34970A; Keysight Technologies). The humidity-sensing
properties were examined by controlling the relative humidity from
25 to 95%. To modify the atmosphere inside the chamber, the mixtures
of dry air and water vapor with different mixing ratios were used.
In addition, a commercial humidity sensor (testo 608-h2) was installed
inside the chamber to obtain the real-time humidity data inside the
chamber. The sensing experiments were carried out at an ambient temperature
of 25 °C and the total gas flow rate was fixed at 500 cm3/min.
