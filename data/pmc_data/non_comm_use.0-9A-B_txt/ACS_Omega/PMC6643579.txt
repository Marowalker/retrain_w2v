Ecofriendly N-heterocyclic
carbene (NHC) organocatalysis can control
the N1-functionalization (aza-Michael addition) and C3-functionalization (Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction,
MBH) of isatins in the absence of (1) a protecting group, (2) a stoichiometric
reagent, and (3) heat energy. The challengeable N1-functionalization
of N-unsubstituted isatins into N-substituted (NS) isatins was realized
through 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
catalysts within 10 min with up to 98% isolation yield. The subsequent
MBH adducts of as-synthesized NS-isatins (N1/C3-functionalization) was perfectly acquired in 10 mol % NHC and 10
mol % 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane catalysis within 30 min with superiority
to C3/N1-functionalization (MBH/aza-Michael).
For guiding the application to a versatile druggable isatin library,
the NHC catalysis was compared with reported functionalization of
isatins in view of green chemistry principles including solvent scoring
of ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable, E-factor, atom economy, and
so on.

Introduction
Isatin is not only
a privileged core structure of versatile natural
products, but also a very useful starting material of indole-containing
biologically active molecules because of the presence of various functionalizable
groups (Figure 1).1−6 Specifically, this potential has been realized in designing useful
drug scaffolds for emerging targets (e.g., chymotrypsin-like protease,
Nrf2) as well as well-known targets binding to neurotransmitters or
their precursors (e.g., MAO, CB2).7−10 However, when compared with the powerful
utility of isatin, it seems that efficiently controlled introduction
of functional groups into isatin has not been reported enough. Even
though reactive isatins prefer nucleophilic additions at the C3-position,11−17 the control of N1- and C3-functionalization
has been tried by various synthetic strategies (N-alkylation,18−21 N-acylation,22,23 N-carbamoylation,24 N-Mannich reaction,25,26 and aza-Michael addition reaction27−34). Despite reports, efficient chemoselective N1-functionalization
of isatin is still difficult because of the undesired reactions resulting
from the multifunctionality of isatins. The first undesired side reaction
in the functionalization of isatins is the decomposition of isatins
into isatinates.35−37

Figure 1 Representative examples of biologically active molecules
containing
a 2-oxindole skeleton.

The second undesired reaction is products resulting from
the failure
of the chemoselectivity (C3- vs N1-site). Any
organic or inorganic base in an optimized method could not show consistent
products in diverse isatin derivatives and electrophiles. For example,
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)/tetrabutylammonium bromide of
catalytic amount could only be applicable to Schiff imine protection
of isatins for aza-Michael product (N1-functionalization).28 In N-unprotected isatins, DABCO is a more efficient
base for Morita–Baylis–Hillman (MBH) reaction (C3-functionalization) rather than aza-Michael reaction (N1-functionalization).16,17 Hence, surely C3-protecting groups of isatins (e.g. ketal,18,21 Schiff imine,28−31 thioketal32) have been developed. Notably,
aza-Michael reaction of Kanger group’s isatin Schiff imine
are only applicable for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors,28−30 and ketal/thioketal shows a loss of isatins as well as a high E-factor
(low atom economy) through protection/reaction/deprotection procedures
(Supporting Information).21,32 Recently, aza-Michael addition of isatins without any C3-protecting group27,33,34 made us to expect efficient direct N1-functionalization
to be more considerable in view of green chemistry (E-factor, atom
economy, and step economy). Kinetics of the saponification depend
on the pH of reactions so that a stoichiometric inorganic base can
result in the saponification of the aza-Michael products as well as
isatins (Supporting Information).27,35 Aza-Michael reaction in imidazolium ionic liquids was applicable
only for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors in spite of a high
expenditure of the ionic liquid.33 Remarkably,
Pace group’s N1-functionalization could show a powerful
advance, but the recyclable KF–Celite mediation required more
than the stoichiometric amount as well as a long time reflux (ca.
12 h) for efficient aza-Michael reaction.34

In this study, we investigated neither the stoichiometric
condition
nor the heating energy required for chemoselective N1-functionalization
of isatins. Therefore, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis
was a reasonable method based on (1) the extrapolated reactivity between
activated olefins and NHCs from the literature38−48 and (2) mild condition escaping saponification.42,43 The stabilized sp2-hybridized lone-pair electrons of NHCs
make C2-carbene highly nucleophilic with the basicity (pKa: 20–28 in tetrahydrofuran (THF))51 and its precatalysts have the advantages (readily available,
cheap, less toxic than metal catalysts, easy to synthesize, and recyclable)
required for green catalysis.42,43 NHCs and imidazolium
salts, conjugated acids of NHCs, can play powerful roles in Lewis/Brønsted
base catalysis, and can facilitate various reactive species (e.g.
acyl anions, homoenolates, acylvinyl anions, and enolates) for synthesizing
a versatile compound collection.42−50 Although the concept of NHC-catalyzed Michael addition exists,38−41 the scope of the nucleophile was limited to primary amines,38 1,3-dicarbonyls,39,40 and thiols41 but not for amides, especially not for isatins.
Herein, we report the efficient NHC-organocatalyzed chemoselective
aza-Michael addition of N-unsubstituted (NUS)-isatins for synthesizing
N-substituted (NS)-isatins (N1-functionalization) in the
absence of (1) a protecting group, (2) a stoichiometric reagent, and
(3) heating energy. The usefulness of the aza-Michael adducts can
be reinforced with the subsequent MBH reaction of as-synthesized NS-isatins
(N1/C3-functionalization) and the reverse synthesis
(C3/N1-functionalization) to construct versatile
isatins as a drug library.

Results and Discussion
Initially,
the aza-Michael reaction of isatin 1a with
methyl acrylate 2a (1:1.2 ratios) was investigated in
the presence of 10 mol % of the organo-NHC precatalyst, 1,3-dimesitylimidazolium
chloride (IMes·Cl), in combination with various organic and inorganic
bases in different solvents to optimize the catalytic conditions.
Acrylates were used in slight excess (1.2 equiv) because of their
volatile nature. The detailed reaction conditions and results are
presented in Table 1. For the preliminary study, base condition of the reaction was investigated
in the presence of the IMes·Cl precatalyst in the selected solvent,
dichloromethane (entries 1–6). The intended roles of the inorganic/organic
base are (a) to generate in situ organo-NHCs from IMes·Cl and
(b) to assist the organo-NHC catalyst-directed path in the aza-Michael
reaction. The combination of the IMes·Cl precatalyst with relatively
mild inorganic/organic bases (Et3N or K2CO3 or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)) resulted in
a highly chemoselective aza-Michael addition in dichloromethane (DCM)
to produce NS-isatin 3aa as the sole product (entries
3–5). On the other hand, the combination of IMes·Cl with
the strong bases KOt-Bu and NaH resulted in the formation
of 3aa along with other unidentified products (entries
1 and 2). The best result was observed under the IMes·Cl/DBU
condition with high chemoselectivity and the maximum yield of 81%
(entry 5). Surprisingly, in contrast to other entries, IMes·Cl/DABCO
produced a MBH product from 1a and 2a (entry
6). Because DABCO is a weaker base than DBU in terms of pKa (pKa values of their conjugated
acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Et3N–H+ pKa ∼ 18.82, DBU–H+ pKa ∼ 24.34, and DABCO–H+ pKa ∼ 8.9),52 it is not sufficient for capturing the NH proton
of isatin, but sufficient for mediating the MBH reaction. Under the
optimal condition of entry 5, we also compared the catalytic efficacy
of four well-known organo-NHC precatalysts (entries 5, 7–9)
to prove that NHC catalysis can produce chemoselective aza-Michael
adducts consistently.

To enhance the performance of entry
5, we studied the solvent effect
in sequence. No considerable improvement was observed in the solvents
MeOH, EtOH, CH3CN, and CHCl3 in either the reaction
time or the yield of 3aa (entries 10–13). In the
case of the THF solvent, the IMes·Cl (A) is sparingly soluble
in the solvent to present a very low yield (entry 14). At this juncture,
we tried to add a catalytic amount of more polar solvent DMSO to the
IMes·Cl/DBU system to improve the solubility and the reaction
rate with the related reports of Arduengo and others.53,54 The white turbid THF solution containing IMes·Cl/DBU (Figure 2a) became a clear,
light yellow solution immediately on the addition of DMSO (Figure 2b), which indicates
the fast generation of in situ organo-NHC. A further quick change
in color from yellow to wine red was observed upon successive addition
of 1a after 2a (Figure 2c,d) with the supposition on the proton loss
(N–H) of 1a during aza-Michael addition. Therefore,
the click-type rapid chemoselective aza-Michael addition took place
between 1a and 2a in less than 1 min at
RT to provide a 93% yield of 3aa (entry 15).

during the aza-Michael reaction between 1a and 2a. (a) Catalyst A (10 mol %), DBU (10
mol %) in THF (1 mL) under N2 at RT; (b) addition of DMSO
(0.1 mL); (c) addition of 2a (1.2 equiv); (d) addition
of 1a (1 equiv) in THF.

Next, with the impressive reaction time and yield, the efficiency
and reaction scope of our optimized reaction was investigated. First,
the loading amount of catalysts was only modified under the optimized
condition (entry 16). Under the condition of 5 mol % of NHC and 5
mol % of DBU, the product 3aa was acquired with a slightly
reduced isolation yield and elongated reaction time (67%, 60 min),
showing the importance of the catalyst loading scale. It is worth
noting that this catalytic system could catalyze the same reaction
even at 0 °C (entry 17). In addition, we attempted a one-pot
synthesis of the aza-Michael reaction followed by the MBH reaction.
The NHC catalyst activity was tested after completion of the aza-Michael
addition in the reaction mixture. The reaction between 1a (1 equiv) and 2a (1.2 equiv) was conducted with the
10 mol % NHC/DBU catalyst system. After 1 min, 1a was
completely converted to 3aa, whereupon one more equivalence
of 2a (1.2 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture.
Surprisingly, 5aa was formed with a low yield (entry
18). An additional reaction was initiated with 1a (1
equiv) and 2a (2.5 equiv), under the 10 mol % NHC/DBU
catalyst condition. In this reaction, 3aa, 4aa, and 5aa were observed with different ratios at the
start of the reaction; after 1 h, 5aa was detected along
with 3aa (entry 19). Additional reactions were conducted
with 30 mol % of DBU or DABCO without the NHC catalyst (entries 20–22).
When DABCO was used as a catalyst, only the MBH product was observed
(63% yield after 8 h, entry 22). In further studies, well-known organic
base/catalyst (4-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP) and chiral organocatalysts
(l-proline and cinchonine) were tested in the reaction (entries
23–26). When compared with the organo-NHC catalysis, they showed
insufficiency and limited yields, proving the efficiency of NHC among
organocatalysts.

Under the optimized reaction condition (entry
15, Table 1), the substrate scope of our reaction was further
investigated
(Table 2). We tested
substrates bearing electron-rich substituents such as 5-Me (adducts 3ba, 3bb, 3bc) as well as moderately
electron-withdrawing substituents such as 5-Cl (adducts 3da, 3db, 3dc), 5-Br (adducts 3ea, 3eb, 3ec), and 5-I (adducts 3ca, 3cb, 3cc) to verify the compatibility
of substrates (up to 98%; reaction time = 1–10 min). In the
scope of Michael acceptors, the less reactive Michael acceptor, tert-butyl acrylate, was tolerable in our methodology (adducts 3ac, 3bc, 3cc, 3dc,
and 3ec).

conditions: 1a–e (1 equiv), 2a–c (1.2 equiv), IMes·Cl (10 mol

DMSO (0.1 mL) under N2 at RT.

The promising results of Table 2 encouraged us to further explore the scope
of the
aza-Michael addition reaction by using various terminal and nonterminal
double-bond Michael acceptors with isatin as depicted in Table 3. Concretely, the
optimal reaction condition is applicable to a wide range of Michael
acceptors like acrylonitrile 2d, phenyl vinyl sulfone 2e, methyl vinyl ketone 2f, methyl methacrylate 2g, ethyl 4-oxo-4-phenyl-2-butenoate 2h, and
ethyl crotonate 2i. However, when 2d and 2e were used as Michael acceptors, the same results were observed
(like acrylates). When 2f was used as a Michael acceptor
at RT, 1a was consumed completely, but the yield of the
product was very low. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, we
finally found that the aza-Michael addition with 2f would
proceed smoothly at −10 °C. We then conducted the reaction
at −10 °C, and changing the addition pattern of DMSO (along
with isatin addition) improved the yield of 3af to 85%
within 15 min. When methyl-substituted double-bond 2g and 2i were used as Michael acceptors, an increase in time and a trace
amount of tryptanthrin 6a were detected. To our delight,
in the absence of a Michael acceptor, the corresponding isatin was
conveniently converted to the tryptanthrin 6a under the
designated condition (Table 3).

In sequence, the catalytic suitability of the nucleophilic
organo-NHCs
was further examined for the MBH reaction of the as-synthesized aza-Michael
products in Table 4. To observe the N-substituent effect on the substrates, we selected
(i) NS-isatin 3aa and (ii) NS-isatin 3ad with activated olefins (methyl acrylate 2a and acrylonitrile 2d), respectively, in the presence of IMes·Cl/DBU and
IMes·Cl/DABCO precatalyst systems under various solvent conditions.
Because in situ generation of free organo-NHC is very fast under the
THF/DMSO condition, it was supposed that acrylates undergo dimerization
and other side reactions to result in a lower conversion and low yield
(Table 1, entries 18
and 19).55,56 To escape the condition, MBH reactions were
first tested in THF. In 10 mol % IMes·Cl/bases, DBU and DABCO
deprotonated the IMes·Cl and generated the organo-NHC in situ.
Although MBH reactions in the presence of IMes·Cl/DBU showed
maximum conversion of the substrates by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) detection (entries 1 and 7), they could not produce a sole MBH
product. On the other hand, the MBH reactions in the presence of IMes·Cl/DABCO
showed clear and major MBH products to reveal the compatibility and
suitability regardless of the N-substituent (entries 2, 8 and 9).
When compared with the NHC catalytic condition, a catalytic base without
NHC did not result in isolable quantities of MBH products in spite
of the substrate consumption (entries 3 and 4). The increased equivalence
of bases (30 mol %) could slightly enhance MBH products, but presented
insufficient efficiency in both the reaction time and yield (entries
5 and 6).

It is also emphasized in the literature
that polar organic solvents
or aqueous–organic mixed-solvent media can accelerate the MBH
reaction by activating the substrates through noncovalent bonding
interactions, including hydrogen bonding and an increase of the equilibrium
constant toward a zwitterionic intermediate;57,58 water or aqueous–organic solvent media are also more promising
solvent conditions for NHC-catalyzed reactions.59−61 In this context,
the MBH reaction was studied in pure 1,4-dioxane, CH3CN,
MeOH, and DMF in the presence of IMes·Cl/DABCO (entries 10–13);
however, no appreciable change was observed in the corresponding MBH
product yields and reaction times. In light of the above patterns,
the MBH reaction was further studied in various mixed aqueous–organic
solvent media (THF/H2O, MeOH/H2O, CH3CN/H2O, 1,4-dioxane/H2O, and DMF/H2O). To our delight, the mixed aqueous–organic solvent media
produced higher yields of MBH products than a single polar solvent
(entries 14–19). The 1,4-dioxane/H2O (1:1) conditions
were the most promising and afforded an excellent yield of 97% within
5 min without purification by column chromatography (entry 17). The
details of the derivatives of the MBH reaction in 1,4-dioxane/H2O have also been depicted in Table 5 (Route A). In addition, the optimal result
did not require column chromatography, but needed only the removal
of the NHC and DABCO with solvent washing and recrystallization with
ethanol to give the desired pure products at an excellent yield.

Table 5 Synthetic Routes for N1- and C3-Substituted 2-Oxindoles
Lastly, the reverse reaction of the aza-Michael/MBH
reaction (C–C
bond formation via MBH reaction and then C–N bond formation
via aza-Michael addition between activated olefins and NUS-isatins)
also was considered to highlight the suitability and generality of
NHC/DABCO-catalyzed MBH reaction and NHC/DBU-catalyzed aza-Michael
addition. In this context, IMes·Cl/DABCO-catalyzed MBH reactions
of isatin 1a with acrylate 2a and acrylonitrile 2d in 1,4-dioxane/H2O at RT were accomplished smoothly
and produced selectively the corresponding MBH adducts with excellent
yields (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 MBH Reaction between NUS-Isatin and Activated Olefins
The MBH adducts 4aa and 4ad can be used
promptly for the IMes·Cl/DBU-catalyzed aza-Michael addition as
described in Route-B of Table 5. As with aza-Michael of NUS-isatins in Table 1, a catalytic amount of DMSO added to THF
can accelerate the generation of in situ organo-NHC from IMes·Cl
in the reaction of the MBH adducts. All of the five aza-Michael addition
reactions with isolation yields of up to 91% were accomplished efficiently
in the presence of the NHC/DBU catalytic system within 1 h (Table 5). When compared with
aza-Michael of the as-synthesized MBH products (Route B), MBH reaction
of the as-synthesized aza-Michael products (Route A) was more efficient
in both time and yield. Details of the derivatives have also been
depicted in Table 5. The study can be an alternative strategy for efficient diversification
of N1- and C3-functionalized isatin libraries.

Mechanism
Under the optimal organo-NHC/DBU catalysis condition, we derive
a plausible mechanism for the chemoselective aza-Michael addition
reaction as shown in Scheme 2 (path A). At first, the in situ-generated organo-NHC attacks
the β-carbon of the acrylate to form a zwitterionic homoenolate I. Now, this homoenolate I captures a proton
from the conjugate acid (DBU–H+) of DBU62 and forms intermediate III. Simultaneously,
DBU captures the amine proton of isatin and triggers the chemoselective
aza-Michael addition to form the NS-isatin. Under the optimized NHC/DABCO
conditions, our plausible catalytic cycle proposed for the MBH reaction
is described in path B (Scheme 2). The nucleophilic addition of acrylate with in situ-generated
organo-NHC by the treatment of a DABCO base produced a zwitterionic
homoenolate I, whereas this homoenolate I did not capture a proton from the conjugate acid (DABCO–H+) because of the low Lewis basicity of DABCO compared with
DBU.63 At this time, the nucleophilic attack
of the NHC acrylate zwitterionic species I to the electrophilic
C3-keto carbonyl site of NS-isatin forms the second zwitterionic
species V followed by proton transfer toward the elimination
of free-NHC to form the aza-Michael–Baylis-oxindole derivative VI.

Scheme 2 Catalytic Cycle of Organo-NHC-Catalyzed Aza-Michael
and MBH Reaction
Furthermore, our methodology could apply to aldol-type
condensation
between NUS-isatin 1a and nonterminal double-bond ethyl
diazoacetate (EDA) 2j to produce α-diazo-β-hydroxy
ester 7aj as an important precursor for diverse products
(Scheme 3).64 The product formation via the NHC/DBU catalyst
system can support that the possibility of proton transfer from the
conjugate acid (DBU–H+) in aza-Michael addition
(Scheme 2, path A).

Scheme 3 Reaction between NUS-Isatin and EDA
Green Chemistry
In view of the green chemistry, our
methodology is compared with
reported methodologies constructing isatin derivatives in Supporting Table 1. First, our method presented
an efficient E-factor among the 13 methods in previous reports and
100% atom economy from the starting material to the product. Second, THF as the major solvent in our methodology showed low- or
middle-range scores in the scoring information of the solvent elicited
from the ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable, which consists of safety,
health, air environment, water environment, and waste categories.
Third, our method (within 15 min at ambient temperature) could show
comparative advantage in energy consumption and accident prevention.
Fourth, our catalysis condition showed an impressive difference in
the loading amount and did not require a protecting group (additional
protection/deprotection steps). With the mentioned
merits, the most outstanding advantage of our methodology over the
13 reported methods in the factors of green chemistry was that only
our method used a renewable catalyst between different batches (Supporting Information).65 Finally, our method permitted efficient and environment-friendly
purification through simple recrystallization after the reaction.

Conclusions
Our designed NHC/base system could efficiently control the chemoselectivity
of unprotected isatin through a selective aza-Micheal or MBH reaction.
In particular, the respective roles of the solvent, base, and substituents
on the substrates in optimizing both aza-Michael and MBH reactions
were assessed. However, in the absence of the organo-NHC (DBU alone),
the reaction lost chemoselective control, became sluggish, and produced
a mixture of aza-Michael and Morita–Baylis–Hillman (MBH)
adducts. In addition, the optimal design of the two NHC-catalyzed
reactions (aza-Michael/MBH or MBH/aza-Michael as a compensatory reverse)
made “the sequenced introduction of two different three-carbon
functionalities” feasible. Our methodology can be applied to
the synthesis of novel and distinctively N1- and C3- functionalized isatin libraries showing variations in steric
and electronic properties; the salient features of this procedure are a short reaction time,
good product yields, and that it does not require column chromatography
for purification. In particular, MBH products are purified through
simple recrystallization techniques with a high atom economy. It also
is a very promising method in view of 12 factors of green chemistry.

Experimental
Section
General
All reactions were carried out with dry solvents
under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Oven-dried rubber
septum-containing round-bottomed flask and glass syringes for the
addition of reactants and solvents were utilized for these reactions.
THF and other solvents were dried based on a standard literature procedure.
All purchased reactants and reagents were used without further purification.
Imidazolium salts were synthesized in our lab. BRUKER NMR instruments
used for 1H NMR (600, 500, and 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (150, 125, and 100 MHz) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and acetone-d6 with regard to tetramethylsilane
as the reference for chemical shift values. Chemical shifts (δ)
were described in parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants (J) are referenced in hertz (Hz). Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were reported in reciprocal centimeters (cm–1) recorded on a BRUKER Tensor 27 (KBr beam splitter) FT-IR spectrometer.
Organic solvents were concentrated on EYELA SB-1200 Rotavapor and
vacuum pump EYELA CCA-1111. Silica gel (60–120 mesh) was used
for purification of crude products by column chromatography. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) presented on precoated silica gel 60 F254 MERCK
and were visualized by exposing UV light or by iodine vapors.

Typical Procedure
for the Aza-Michael Addition Reaction
A dried round-bottomed
flask was charged with IMes·Cl salt (10
mol %) and DBU (10 mol %) in dry THF (1 mL) under an N2 atmosphere. To this, addition of DMSO (0.1 mL), acrylate/acrylonitrile
(1.2 mmol), and dropwise addition of N-unsubstituted 2-oxindole (1
mmol) solution in dry THF (1 mL) at room temperature by using a syringe
were carried out. When the reaction was completed as observed by TLC,
the mixture was diluted with water (5 mL) and extracted using EtOAc
(15 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated
under reduced pressure. The crude residue was purified by column chromatography
(5% EtOAc/hexane) to give the desired pure products with good yield.

Typical Procedure for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman
Reaction
A dried round-bottomed flask was charged with IMes·Cl
salt (10 mol %) and DABCO (10 mol %) in 1,4-dioxane/H2O
(1:1) (1 mL). To this, acrylate/acrylonitrile (1.2 mmol) and N-substituted
2-oxindole (1 mmol) were added at room temperature. When the reaction
was completed as observed by TLC, the mixture was extracted using
EtOAc (15 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4,
and evaporated under reduced pressure. Although our method was developed
at a bench-top scale, it could be scaled up to the process chemistry
level because of the well-known purification process of NHC catalysis
without the need for column purification. In particular, our method
showed only a single product without any remaining starting material
or byproducts and only required the removal of the NHC and solvent.

Recrystallization
When the reaction mixture was extracted
with ethyl acetate, Mes-NHC was eliminated as a residue from the product
because of the insolubility of Mes-NHC salts in ethyl acetate. After
evaporation of the ethyl acetate, the crude solid was washed with
hexane, which removed DABCO residues because of the good solubility
of DABCO in hexane. After washing, the crude product was dried and
recrystallized with ethanol to give the desired pure products in good
yield.
