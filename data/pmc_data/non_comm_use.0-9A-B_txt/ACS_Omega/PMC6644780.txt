We report the existence of a short-lived
triplet electronic state
of 2,6-ANS (2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid), which, together
with nonplanar (NP) and planar [charge-transfer (CT)] states, is produced
following photoexcitation; these results are based on nanosecond transient
absorption and time-resolved decays. The short-lived triplet state
has a lifetime of ∼126 ns and is observed via triplet–triplet
(T–T) transitions after exciting 2,6-ANS with a pump laser
pulse of 355 nm (probe wavelength range of 360–500 nm). Moreover,
the CT state, which is very close to the NP state produced from the
locally excited state/NP state, emits active fluorescence with a lifetime
of ∼11 ns. The solvent plays a major role in the rotation of
the phenylamino group during the conversion of the NP state to the
CT state, and vice versa. Intersystem crossing occurs from the CT
state. Thus, investigating the triplet state together with the CT/NP
states of 2,6-ANS, a commonly used probe for sensing proteins and
other biomolecules, is highly relevant and helps reveal its photoexcitation
dynamics.

Introduction
Probes containing the
anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) fluorophore,
which is characterized by the dependence of its absorption, fluorescence
(FL), FL quantum yield (QY), and lifetime on its environment, have
been used for studying the structures of biological macromolecules
for the past several years.1−4 ANS and the related molecules 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate
and 2,6-ANS (2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid) are the most widely
used molecules featuring this fluorophore. A dramatic change in the
FL QY with different solvents, a change in FL intensity with the local
environment, and a drastic blue shift of the FL wavelength maximum
in low-polarity solvents relative to that in higher polarity solvents
such as water have been observed.1−3 An increase in FL intensity
in a hydrophobic environment was also reported in 1954.4 In biological fields, ANS has been used as a
hydrophobicity probe for protein folding and for cell surface studies.5 The characteristic features of the ANS fluorophore
have been used successfully to evaluate the micropolarity of the local
environment in proteins and lipid nanotubes.6,7 These
photoinduced electron-transfer-based probes are also sensitive to
the pH and the presence of transition-metal ions in the environment.8 The mechanism of ANS involves the intramolecular
rotation of the phenylamino group and the subsequent conversion of
its nonplanar (NP) state to the stable charge-transfer (CT) state
immediately after photoexcitation. However, different explanations
for the massive solvent effects on the excited-state lifetime have
been given.1−11

Here, we applied nanosecond transient absorption (TA) and
time-resolved
FL techniques to 2,6-ANS dissolved in degassed methanol and measured
the nanosecond TA and FL decays. On the basis of the TA and FL decay
curves, along with the steady-state spectra, the S–S (singlet–singlet)
and T–T (triplet–triplet) transitions that occur following
the photoexcitation have been confirmed, and the nonradiative transition
through intersystem crossing (ISC) was found to be responsible for
the decrease in FL QY.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the absorption, FL, and FL excitation spectra of 2,6-ANS in methanol.
The absorption spectrum shows the lowest energy band at approximately
350 nm as well as strong bands at approximately 319 and 273 nm, whereas
the FL spectrum shows a band maximum at 420 nm. The FL excitation
spectrum is nearly the same as the absorption spectrum, as shown in Figure 1a, which indicates
that the QY does not change with excitation. Thus, the steady-state
absorption represents the locally excited singlet state transitions.
The FL may arise from the NP state and/or from a CT state produced
following the rotation of the phenylamino group in polar solvents.
FL from the NP state is observed in less polar solvents.3 Furthermore, the FL spectra were also measured
at temperatures varying from −10 to 50 °C and are shown
in Figure 1b. Cooling
from room temperature to −10 °C was expected to double
the solvent viscosity relative to that at room temperature, but the
intensity of the FL band increases without any significant shift in
wavelength. The increase in FL intensity is due to the slowdown of
the nonradiative deactivation. When the temperature increases above
room temperature, the FL intensity decreases without a considerable
shift in band position, indicating that the FL originates from the
CT state only, that is, from the planar molecule. However, the NP
and CT states are very close to each other in alcoholic solvents and
water, and both of them may exist.9,11 When the temperature
increases further above 40 °C, the FL intensity again starts
increasing without any significant shift, which may affect the rate
of the ISC process.

Figure 1 (a) Absorption, normalized FL, and corrected FL excitation
spectra
of 2,6-ANS dissolved in methanol. The inset shows the chemical structure
of 2,6-ANS. (b) FL spectra of 2,6-ANS in methanol as a function of
temperature. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 nm (a,b)
and 420 nm (a), respectively.

In addition, FL decay analysis was performed with a 336 nm
excitation
wavelength and was monitored using a 420 nm emission wavelength under
degassed conditions and atmospheric conditions, both of which are
shown in Figure 2.
Both decay profiles could be well-simulated by assuming a single-exponential
decay function, that is, A1 exp(−t/τ1), and the lifetime τ1 is determined. The fitted lifetime is 10.89 ± 0.02 ns with
χ2 = 1.29. Under atmospheric conditions, the lifetime
becomes 7.43 ± 0.02 ns (χ2 = 1.17). Thus, the
observed lifetime is a single exponential and is quenched reasonably
in the presence of oxygen. The observed FL lifetime originates from
the relaxed state which is designated the CT state. Furthermore, the
single lifetime of 2,6-ANS in methanol is ascribed to the fast interconversion
between the CT and NP states. The reported lifetime of 2,6-ANS varies
with different solvents and mixtures of solvents and is typically
0.3 ns of the CT state FL and approximately 1–5 ns of the NP
state in water, which is debatable.3 In
addition to the solvent, oxygen is an important factor that can alter
the lifetime of such biomolecules, as observed in this study. Thus,
the lifetime of ANS strongly depends on the solvent system.

Figure 2 FL decay curves
of 2,6-ANS in methanol (solid black line) obtained
at 298 K under degassed conditions and simulated curve (dotted red
line). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 336 and 420 nm,
respectively. The FL decay curve (solid green line) and simulated
curve (dotted red line) obtained without degassing. The instrumental
response function is shown with the solid blue line.

Figures 3 and 4 show the TA spectrum and dynamical
curves, respectively,
of 2,6-ANS in methanol under degassed conditions. The measurements
were carried out at 5 mJ@355 nm excitation and every 10 nm interval
in the 360–500 nm region. The corresponding instrumental response
function of the dynamical curve is provided in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The pulse energy was
maintained as small as possible to still obtain the transient signal
while avoiding additional reactions.12 It
can be seen from Figure 3 that a series of absorption/emission peaks last for several sub-microseconds.
The positive (red color) and negative (blue) signals are attributed
to the T–T and S–S transitions, respectively. Strong
S–S transitions appear at approximately 360–380 nm,
which may be due to the ground-state bleaching effect. Above this
point, both positive and negative lobes were obtained at each probe
wavelength, indicating that both T–T absorption and S–S
emission occur (Figures 4 and 5). Different dynamical curves were selected
because of their high signal-to-noise ratios for fitting. However,
only the dynamical curves obtained at 400 and 425 nm are shown in Figure 5. The positive part
of the TA signal is well-fitted with the single-exponential fit component:
ΔAbs(t) = A2 exp(−t/τ2), where τ2 and A2 are the lifetime and the pre-exponential factor,
respectively. The fitted lifetime is 0.126 ± 0.004 μs with
an adjustment R2 of >0.9. Similarly,
the
negative part of the dynamical curves is fitted with the single-exponential
fit. However, the fitted lifetime could not be considered accurate,
as the lifetime of the FL is approximately 10.89 ns, which is beyond
the resolution of the TA system. The long lifetime corresponds to
the positive amplitude of the TA signal designated to the T–T
transitions (absorption), that is, assigned to the short-lived triplet
state. Thus, the TA signal of 2,6-ANS demonstrates the existence of
a short-lived triplet state. However, the emission measurement, which
was conducted between −10 and 50 °C, did not show any
emission from the triplet state, even at −10 °C.

and red curves represent the original data and the single-exponential
fit, respectively.

Following photoexcitation,
an NP state is initially produced and
subsequently forms a CT state that emits FL. However, the NP and CT
states of 2,6-ANS lay very close to each other in alcoholic solvents9 and are not distinguishable in water.11 We did not observe any significant shift in
the FL spectrum with decreasing temperature, that is, upon increasing
the viscosity of the solvent, and vice versa, which indicates that
the FL may originate from the CT state and that the solvent methanol
allows the rotation of the phenylamino group. Importantly, both the
NP and CT states can yield triplets.9,10 The CT state
that emits active FL undergoes a nonradiative transition through ISC.
The TA, together with FL decay analysis and steady-state spectra,
indicates the existence of NP/CT (due to fast interconversion) and
triplet states of 2,6-ANS; among these species, the CT state emits
strong FL with a lifetime of ∼11 ns, as demonstrated in Figure 6.

photoexcitation dynamics of 2,6-ANS.

The molecule 2,6-ANS has been studied based on the TA spectra/dynamical
curves and time-resolved FL decay curves. The fitted TA and FL decay
curves show the existence of NP/CT and triplet states with lifetimes
of approximately 11 and 126 ns, respectively. Thus, the present investigation
of 2,6-ANS, a molecule commonly used to probe biomolecules, is highly
important and unusual, as it opens up new avenues to understand the
existence of the CT and triplet states of ANS and the variable QY.

Methods
and Materials
2,6-ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes,
USA, and was used without
further purification. Steady-state absorption and FL spectra were
recorded with a LAMBDA-750 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer) and
a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon), respectively.
The details about the equipment were described in our previous report.13 A sample heater/cooler Peltier thermocouple
device (FI-3004) equipped with a Fluorolog-3 was used for recording
the temperature from −10 to 50 °C. Time-resolved FL decay
curves were collected on a time-correlated single-photon counting
system (DeltaFlex, HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a PPD-850 detector using
a delta diode as an excitation source.

Nanosecond TA measurements
were performed with pump–probe
techniques, as described in our previous reports.12,14,15 All samples were thoroughly degassed (N2) before obtaining the spectra, FL decays, TA spectra, and
dynamical curves. The concentration of the samples was 20 μM,
and the path length of the sample quartz cuvette was 10 mm.
