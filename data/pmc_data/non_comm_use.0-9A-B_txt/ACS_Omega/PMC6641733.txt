Cyclopropanation using dimethylsulfoxonium
methylide (Corey–Chaykovsky
reaction) was examined with a series of linear α,β-unsaturated
ketones, and the results showed that the major trajectory for the
addition of the sulfur ylide to the enones is anti, related to the
γ-substituent. The stereochemical assignment for the generated
cyclopropanes was achieved by X-ray crystallography or comparing with
the reported spectroscopic data. We found that the diastereoselectivity
was influenced by several factors, including the protecting groups,
solvents, and temperatures, and good anti/syn ratios (>10:1) were
often obtained using the tert-butyldimethylsilyl
and tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-protected substrates.
The method was applied to a formal synthesis of a natural eicosanoid
with good efficiency.

Introduction
The structure of cyclopropane
is prevalent in natural products,
biologically active compounds, and organic materials.1−3 As highly strained molecules, cyclopropane and its derivatives are
also useful building blocks or precursors to access various structures
downstream.4 Substituted cyclopropanes,
like many cyclic compounds, often possess the elements of stereochemistry,
which influence the physical, chemical, and biological properties
of target compounds.5 Therefore, chemists
are interested in and continue to develop various methods to prepare
cyclopropanes with good stereochemical control.6 Common methods include metal-mediated carbene insertion,7 the Simmons–Smith reaction,8 Wadsworth–Emmons cyclopropanations,9 Kulinkovich–de Meijere reactions,10 and various Michael-induced ring closure reactions.11 Among these methods, the Michael addition of
dimethylsulfoxonium methylide to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
compounds and the following intramolecular displacement of dimethyl
sulfoxide (Corey–Chaykovsky reaction) is a convenient way to
prepare cyclopropyl ketones or esters.12 Because the addition of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide to an enone
produced the same enolate intermediate regardless of the E- or Z-geometry
of the original enones, the following ring closure usually gives a
thermodynamically stable trans-1,2-disubstituted
cyclopropane.13 Therefore, the stereochemistry
of the products is determined at the first step, 1,4-addition of sulfur
ylides, which is known to go through the less hindered face of the
cyclic enones14 (Scheme 1). However, the diastereoselectivity for
the addition of sulfur ylides to γ-substituted, linear/acyclic
enones is complicated. For example, Wills et al. reported the anti-addition
as the major pathway,15 but Ma’s,
Krief’s, and Gurjar’s groups reported that acetonide-protected
γ-alkoxy-α,β-unsaturated esters or ketones gave
the syn-adducts as the major products.13,16 These contradictory
results were further confirmed during our synthesis of (−)-brevipolide
H, in which the opposite diastereoselectivities of the cyclopropanations
were observed when the protecting groups for the γ,δ-diols
were altered from the acetonide group to others.17 However, only one type of enones, bearing γ,δ-distereocenters,
was studied in our previous work.

Scheme 1 Stereochemisty for Corey–Chaykovsky
Reactions
Herein, we present
our systematic studies on the diastereoselectivity
of the cyclopropanation with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide using a
series of linear, γ-substituted α,β-unsaturated
enones. Our results verify that the anti-addition is the major trajectory
for the addition of sulfur ylides to acyclic enones although the diastereomeric
ratio may vary by the reaction factors applied, such as protecting
groups, solvents, and temperature. A formal synthesis of a cyclopropane-containing
eicosanoid was achieved with this anticyclopropanation.

Results and Discussion
Various γ-hydroxyl group-protected (−)-ethyl l-lactates (1a–f) were prepared according
to the reported methods.18 The following
diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) reduction and Wittig olefination
yielded a series of α,β-unsaturated phenyl ketones, in
which the γ-hydroxyl groups were protected as silyl ethers (2a–c), ethoxy methyl ether (2d), benzyl ether (2e), and triphenylmethyl ether (2f) (Scheme 2). The catalytic amount (10 mol %) of benzoic acid in the Wittig
reactions gave the E-olefins only.19

Scheme 2 Preparation of γ-Hydroxyl-Protected α,β-Unsaturated
Enones 2
The results derived from the reactions of the γ-silyloxy-
or alkoxy-substituted, α,β-unsaturated phenyl ketones 2 and dimethyloxosulfonium methylide are summarized in Table 1. After the removal
of the protecting groups, all of the reactions provided the same major
diastereomer (5), which was separated and characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR. The stereochemistry of the
cyclopropane moiety related to the hydroxyl group of compound 5 was unambiguously assigned as anti by X-ray crystallography
of its 1-adamantyl carbamate derivative 7 (Figure 1), prepared in eq 1.a When we
applied the reaction conditions developed in our previous study of
cyclopropanation,17 −30 °C
and different ratios of dimethylformamide (DMF)/tetrahydrofuran (THF)
as the solvents, good yields but moderate diastereoselectivities were
observed (entries 1–3, Table 1). It is interesting to note that the diastereoselectivity
improved as the ratio of DMF increased and the reaction using the
single solvent (DMF) gave the best ratio of the anti/syn for the cyclopropanes
derived from phenyl ketone 2a (12:1, entry 4). tert-Butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)-protected enone 2b was also an ideal substrate for this cyclopropanation reaction as
a good diastereomeric ratio (13:1) was observed (entry 5). Further
increasing the steric hindrance of the silyl ether group to triisopropylsilyl
(TIPS) did not improve the diastereoselectivity (entry 6). Moderate
diastereoselectivities observed for γ-ethoxymethoxy-enone 2d and γ-benzyloxy-enone 2e (entries 7
and 8) indicate that the silyl ether groups, such as −OTBS
and OTBDPS, are more helpful than the alkoxyl groups in yielding the
conformers of enones favoring anti-addition. Trityl-group-protected
enone 2f only gave slight excess in the
antiadduct (entry 9). These results confirm that relative to the γ-substituent,
anti-addition of dimethyloxosulfonium
methylide to α,β-unsaturated enone is the major reaction
pathway (Figure 2).6d,20 However, the steric hindrance of the protecting groups may not be
the only factor to account for the anti-addition as the two most bulky
substrates, TIPS and trityl protected enones (2c and 2f, respectively), only gave moderate selectivities. 1  We further prepared a series of γ-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy-substituted,
α,β-unsaturated
ketones to study the diastereoselectivity of their cyclopropanations.
The results are summarized in Table 2. For the aryl ketones bearing different functional
groups, such as halogen, ester, and isolated olefin (8–10, respectively), good yields (up to 97%) and
diastereoselectvities (dr up to 9) were observed for the reactions
conducted in DMF and at −30 °C (condition A, entries 1–3).
Although excellent diastereoselectivity was observed for cyclopropanation
of methyl ketone 11 under condition A, the reaction yield
was rather poor (13%, entry 4). Alkyl ketones 11–15 were indeed less reactive than the aryl ketones for cyclopropanations.
We found that the DMF/THF mixed solvents were helpful in obtaining
a good yield while maintaining the desired diastereoselectivity (entries
5 and 6). This trend was also observed for the tert-butyl ketone (12, entries 7–9) and is consistent
with our previous studies with α,β-unsaturated alkyl ketones.17 Therefore, the DMF/THF mixed solvents were applied
to the rest of the ketones (13 and 14, entries
10–11) and synthetically useful results were obtained for these
ketones with a 3-butenyl or 2-phenylethyl group. Although benzyl-protected
enone 15 only gave a 1.4:1 diastereomeric ratio of cyclopropane
adducts (entry 12), the 1H NMR of the major diastereomer
is consistent with the spectroscopic data of the reported anti-15C, in which the cyclopropane was derived from the cyclization
of a chiral, homoallylic triflate and supported by X-ray crystallography.21 Compound 11C, prepared in this
study, was also converted to the same anti-15C after
the removal of its TBS group and the following benzylation (eq 2), which provides a solid
basis to support the antistereochemical assignment. 2  This method was applied to our formal synthesis
of cyclorpoyl-containing eicosanoid 16, which was isolated
by the incubation
of arachidonic acid with an acetone powder of the Caribbean soft coral Plexaura homomalla and showed an inhibitory activity
to lipoxygenases.22,23 These properties of 16 stimulated several synthetic studies on this compound.24,21b The structural features of this eicosanoid include a six-membered
lactone bearing a cyclopropyl ketone group, whose stereochemistry
matches the outcome preparing from the anti-addition of the sulfur
ylide to α,β-unsaturated enone in this study, and makes
eicosanoid 16 a good target to demonstrate its efficiency
(Scheme 3).

Homoallylic
alcohol 21 was prepared from d-mannitol in three
steps.25 The following
TBS protection of the hydroxyl group, acidic hydrolysis, and oxidative
cleavage of the acetonide provided intermediate aldehyde 23, which was converted to key enone 24 with 65% from 22 (Scheme 4).

Scheme 5 Formal Synthesis of Eicosanoid 16
The addition of the sulfur ylide to enone 24 generated
cyclopropane 19 with the diastereoselectivity of 9:1
and 57% yield (Scheme 5). The anti-isomer was isolated after the removal of the TBS group
by hydrogen fluoride pyridine and converted to acrylate 20. The following ring closing metathesis yielded unsaturated lactone 26, which was hydrogenated with Pd/C to provide reported precursor 17 for the synthesis of eicosanoid 16.24e This synthesis shows that the anti-addition
of dimethyloxosulfonium methylide to α,β-unsaturated enone
is a convenient and stereoselective method to prepare cyclopropyl
ketones, such as eicosanoid 16.

Conclusions
The
anti-addition should be the major pathway for cyclopropanations
using dimethyloxosulfonium methylide and acyclic γ-substituted,
α,β-unsaturated enone, and good diastereoselectivities,
anti/syn >10:1, could be obtained with TBS- or tert-butyldiphenylsily (TBDPS)-protected substrates. The choice of the
reaction solvents is important as synthetically useful results were
obtained with DMF and DMF/THF (1:10) for the aryl ketones and alkyl
ketones, respectively. The key intermediate for the synthesis of cycloproyl
eicosanoid 16 was efficiently prepared by this cyclopropanation.

Experimental
Section
All reactions involving air- or moisture-sensitive
reagents or
intermediates were performed under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen
in oven-dried glassware. All reagents and solvents were obtained from
commercial suppliers and used without further purification, if not
mentioned otherwise. THF and diethyl ether were dried over sodium,
monitored with benzophenone ketyl radical, and distilled prior to
use. Dichloromethane (DCM) and toluene were dried over CaH2 and distilled prior to use. Thin layer chromatography was done using
precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates containing a fluorescent indicator;
purification by chromatography was done using silica gel (230–400
mesh). 1H and 13C chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million and referenced to the residual solvent. All spectra

Condition A
In a flame-dried round-bottomed flask,
a solution of sodium hydride (0.42 mmol),
trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (0.42 mmol), and DMF (1 mL) was stirred
at room temperature for 45 min under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The
reaction mixture was cooled to −30 °C, added with a solution
of enone (2a–f, 8, 9, 10, or 11, 0.21 mmol) in DMF
(1 mL), stirred for another 16 h at −30 °C, quenched with
saturated NH4Cl(aq) (3 mL), and extracted with
diethyl ether (20 mL × 3). The combined organic layers were dried
over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The crude product
was purified by column chromatography (1% EtOAc in hexanes) to give
the cyclopropyl ketones.

Condition B
In a flame-dried flask,
a solution of sodium
hydride (0.42 mmol), trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (0.42 mmol), and
DMF (0.2 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 45 min under an atmosphere
of nitrogen. The reaction mixture was diluted with THF (1 mL), cooled
to −30 °C, added with a solution of enone (11 or 12, 0.21 mmol) in THF (1 mL), stirred for another
16 h at −30 °C, quenched with saturated NH4Cl(aq) (3 mL), and extracted with diethyl ether (20 mL
× 3). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate,
filtered, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column
