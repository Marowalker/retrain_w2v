Renal
epithelial cell injury is a key step in inducing kidney stone
formation. This injury induced by crystallites with different shapes
and aggregation states has been receiving minimal research attention.
To compare the shape and aggregation effects of calcium oxalate crystals
on their toxicity, we prepared calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals
with the morphology of a hexagonal lozenge, a thin hexagonal lozenge,
and their corresponding aggregates. We then compared their toxicities
toward human kidney proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. All
four shapes of COM crystals caused cell-membrane rupture, upregulated
intracellular reactive oxygen, and decreased mitochondrial membrane
potential. This series of phenomena ultimately led to necrotic cell
death. The overall damage in cells was determined in terms of both
exterior and interior damage. Crystals with a large Ca2+ ion-rich (1̅01) active face showed the greatest toxicity in
HK-2 cells and the largest extent of adhesion onto the cell surface.
Crystals with sharp edges easily caused cell-membrane ruptures. The
aggregation of sharp crystals aggravated cell injury, whereas the
aggregation of blunt crystals weakened cell injury. Therefore, crystal
shapes and aggregation states were important factors that affected
crystal toxicity in renal epithelial cells. All of these findings
elucidated the relationship between the physical properties of crystals
and cytotoxicity and provided theoretical references for inhibiting
stone formation.

1 Introduction
Kidney stones are a common
and extremely painful disorder of the
urinary tract.1 The mechanism by which
kidney stones are formed has not yet been completely clarified. Approximately
80% of all kidney stones are calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones; calcium
oxalate monohydrate (COM) is the main constituent of CaOx stones formed
in the urinary system of patients with urolithiasis; its incidence
is approximately twice that of calcium oxalate dihydrate stones.2,3

Urinary crystals in normal patients and those with kidney
stones
often differ in shape, size, and crystal phase due to the differences
in the supersaturation of lithogenic salts, pH value, and content
of inhibitors and promoters among individuals.4,5 In
our previous study,4 we observed that most
crystallites in healthy urine samples are spheroidal and well dispersed
but that the major particles in lithogenic urine exhibit sharply angled
edges and tips. Robertson et al.5 also
found that calcium oxalate crystalluria in recurrent stone formers
mainly comprises large polycrystalline aggregates with sharp edges.
In controls, calcium oxalate is in the form of small blunt particles
with few aggregations.

The particle shape, an important physical
parameter, plays a vital
role in crystal–cell interaction. Wang et al.6 synthesized gold nanospheres, nanorods (NRs), and nanopolyhedrons
using a seed-mediated growth method and compared their toxicity in
a zebrafish model; the authors found that gold nanospheres exhibit
more toxicity in comparison with NRs and nanopolyhedrons. A study
on zebrafish embryos showed that 30, 60, and 100 nm spherical nickel
nanoparticles are less toxic than 60 nm dendritic clusters. These
results suggest that the configuration of nanoparticles may affect
their toxicity more than size, and defects due to nanoparticle exposure
occur through different biological mechanisms.7 The shape of a particle can also affect its uptake pathway. Qiu
et al.8 found that the cellular uptake
of Au NRs is highly shape dependent, that is, fewer long NRs are internalized
in comparison with short NRs with similar surface charges. The interaction
between exogenous materials and biological systems has gained increasing
attention, but the effect of the shape of urinary crystallites on
kidney stone formation has rarely been studied.

Stone morphology
has recently become an important parameter in
understanding specific lithogenic processes, orienting physicians
with regard to peculiar etiological factors and reflecting the lithogenic
activities of diseases.9,10 In most cases, stone nucleation
results from the retention of large crystals or aggregates or from
the agglomeration of large amounts of tiny crystals within the lumen
of a tubule.10 In general, large crystallites
(measuring typically some tens of micrometers) are made of a collection
of some hundreds of small crystallites; the morphology of bulk crystallites
is often a macroscopic display of small crystallites. Therefore, in
the present work, we prepared COM crystals with the morphology of
a hexagonal lozenge, a thin hexagonal lozenge, and their corresponding
aggregates. We then compared their toxicities toward human kidney
proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells to reveal the effect of the
shape of crystals on kidney stone formation at the molecular and cellular
levels.

2 Results
2.1 Preparation and Characterization
of COM Crystals
with Varying Shapes
COM crystals with four different shapes
were prepared by altering the reactant concentration, reaction temperature,
stirring speed, and additive. Figure 1a–d shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the 10 μm COM crystals with four different shapes:
hexagonal lozenge (COM-HL), hexagonal lozenge aggregate (COM-HLA),
thin hexagonal lozenge (COM-TL), and thin hexagonal lozenge aggregate
(COM-TLA). The prepared COM crystals were homogeneous in shape within
the sample group. COM-HL exhibited a hexagonal lozenge morphology
under the condition of zero additives (Figure 1a). COM-TL showed a thin hexagonal lozenge
structure (Figure 1c) as a result of the addition of Na3cit, which is a common
drug for the prevention and cure of urinary stones. NaCl additives
can promote crystal aggregation. COM-HLA and COM-TLA were obtained
by adding NaCl during the crystal preparation process.

COM-HL; (b) COM-HLA; (c) COM-TL; (d) COM-TLA; (e) XRD spectra; (f)
FT-IR spectra. Scale bars: 10 μm.

The crystal phases were detected by XRD characterization,
all of
the COM crystals were detected the diffraction peaks at d = 0.593, 0.365, 0.296, 0.235, and 0.197 nm, which were assigned
to (1̅01), (020), (2̅02), (130), and (3̅03) planes
of COM crystals (PDF card number: 20-0231), respectively (Figure 1e). All of the XRD
patterns showed no other impurity peak, indicating that the prepared
samples were pure phase COM crystals.

However, partial diffraction
peaks of COM-TL are very weak. In
the XRD pattern, the smaller the crystal face exposed, the intensity
of the crystal face is also weaker.11 Because
COM-TL exposed the smallest (010) plane and the largest (1̅01)
plane (Figure 1c) among
the four crystals and (010) crystal face of COM crystals corresponds
to the spacing d200 of COM in XRD pattern,
the intensity of the spacing d(020) of
COM-TL was the weakest among the four COM crystals. That is, the XRD
result is consistent with the SEM observation. The intensity ratio
of the main (1̅01) and (020) planes (I1̅01/I020) of COM with varying
shapes was calculated and ranked in the following order: COM-TL >
COM-TLA > COM-HL > COM-HLA (Table 1).

Chemical Properties of COM Crystals with Various Shapes

COM-TLA	9.6 ± 0.3	Na3cit + NaCl	2.52	2.54	–6.24 ± 0.92	25.3 ± 3.57	
The four COM crystals in various morphologies were also verified
by FT-IR spectra (Figure 1f). All COM crystals had a broad band at 3491–3058
cm–1, and this band split into five absorption peaks,
which belonged to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration
peaks of the O–H bond of crystal water of COM. The asymmetric
stretching (νas) and symmetric stretching (νs) vibration of the carboxyl group (−COO) in COM were
at about 1620 and 1321 cm–1, respectively.12 In the fingerprint region, the absorption peaks
of COM occurred at about 947 (C–O stretching vibration), 885,
785 (C–C stretching vibration), 663, and 514 cm–1 (O–C–O plane bending vibration). The results of FT-IR
and XRD analysis revealed that all prepared COM were pure targeted products.

Table 1 shows the
detected specific surface areas (SBET),
conductivities, and ζ potentials. The SBET and ζ potential of COM-TL and COM-HL were less than
those of COM-TLA and COM-HLA. The conductivities of the four COM crystals
did not show regular changes.

2.2 Changes
of Cell Viability Caused by COM Crystals
with Various Shapes
To compare the cytotoxicity of the four
COM crystals in renal epithelial cells, we used the CCK-8 assay in
the detection of cell viability (Figure 2). The adopted concentration of COM crystals
ranged from 200 to 800 μg/mL, which was consistent with most
previous studies.3 All four COM crystals
induced cell damage and caused a decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent
manner. COM-HLA exhibited significantly higher toxicity in HK-2 cells
compared to that in COM-HL single crystals, especially under high
concentrations (400 and 800 μg/mL, p < 0.01).
This characteristic may explain why sharp crystals easily cause acute
injury. The COM-TL crystal with a large (1̅01) active face presented
an obviously greater toxicity than COM-TLA (p <
0.01).

concentration of COM-HLA treatment group, COM-TL treatment group vs

0.01.

2.3 Changes
of Cell Morphology Caused by COM Crystals
with Various Shapes
Changes in cell morphology can directly
reflect the degree of cell damage. Thus, we observed the overall morphology
of normal cells and the cells with COM crystals through the hematoxylin–eosin
(HE) staining assay (Figure 3). The cells in the control group presented a plump spindle
shape, and the cytoplasm was stained uniformly. The morphologies of
the cells treated with the COM crystals of different shapes became
disordered and presented chromatin condensation as well as eosinophilic
staining enhancement. The COM-TL crystals caused the most serious
damage to HK-2 cells, morphological disorder, and cell swelling. Most
of the adhered crystals appeared to be flat on the surface of the
cell islands. Schepers et al.13 also reported
that crystals mainly lay on the surface of cell islands formed by
proximal tubule cells, whereas crystals are predominantly found at
the periphery of cell groups formed by collecting duct cells.

to 400 μg/mL COM crystals with various shapes for 6 h. Scale
bars: 50 μm.

2.4 LDH Release
Caused by COM Crystals with Various
Shapes
Plasma membrane damage is an important aspect of cellular
toxicity upon particle treatment. When cells have plasma membrane
damage, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is released to the outside of the
cells. The four types of crystals caused the release of intracellular
LDH in varying degrees, with the released amount increasing with the
increase of crystal concentration (Figure 4). COM-HLA and COM-TLA caused higher damage
in cell membranes than COM-HL and COM-TL single crystals, especially
under higher crystal concentrations (400 and 800 μg/mL, p < 0.01). This characteristic may explain why these
aggregates exposed sharp edges and corners. The change rule of membrane
damage was not completely consistent with the change rule of cell
viability (Figure 1).

concentrations of COM crystals with various shapes for 6 h. Compared
with control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. COM-HL treatment group vs corresponding concentration
of COM-HLA treatment group, COM-TL treatment group vs corresponding
concentration of COM-TLA treatment group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01.

2.5 Cell-Membrane Integrity
Analysis via Propidium
Iodide (PI) Staining
Propidium iodide (PI) cannot penetrate
normal cell membranes but can pass through damaged cell membranes
and bind to DNA in the nucleus, thereby emitting red fluorescence.
PI is often used to detect cell-membrane damage. Figure 5 shows the fluorescence images
and fluorescence intensity of HK-2 cells stained with PI after incubation
with COM-HL, COM-HLA, COM-TL, and COM-TLA crystals for 6 h. In the
control group, few PI-positive cells were observed and the cell nucleus
exhibited a uniform morphology. The number of PI-positive cells increased
in the groups treated with the COM crystals of various shapes. Furthermore,
the stained nuclei were uneven in shape and showed a tailing phenomenon,
which may explain why the COM crystals caused necrotic cell death
that led to random DNA rupture. The number of PI-positive cells in
the COM-HLA- and COM-TLA-treated groups was higher than that in the
COM-HL and COM-TL treated groups. Both PI staining and the LDH release
assay can detect the extent of cell-membrane damage, but the CCC-K
assay is used to detect total cell viability. Thus, we speculated
that cell injury is not caused by the single factor of cell-membrane
damage alone.

0.05, **p < 0.01. COM-HL treatment group vs COM-HLA
treatment group, COM-TL treatment group vs COM-TLA treatment group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01.

2.6 ROS Generation
Induced by COM Crystals with
Various Shapes
The amount of intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS) is the most commonly used index for assessing the toxicity
of particles. The generated ROS in the COM crystal-treated cells was
labeled as DCFH-DA and analyzed via flow cytometry (Figure 6). Compared with the ROS level
in the control group, the ROS levels in the four treated groups increased
by different degrees. The COM-HL single crystal caused an 11.99% ROS
increase in the HK-2 cells; this value was lower than that of the
COM-HLA (18.01%, p < 0.01). The ROS level in the
COM-TL single crystal-treated group (18.61%) was obviously higher
than that in the COM-TLA-treated group (10.67%, p < 0.01).

ROS; (B) quantitative results of intracellular ROS. Compared with

treatment group vs COM-TLA treatment group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01.

2.7 Decrease in Δψm Caused
by COM Crystals with Various Shapes
Apoptosis and necrosis
are often preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular, a
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Mitochondria have high Δψm potential under
normal circumstances and would become depolarized after suffering
injury. Therefore, we analyzed the changes in Δψm in cells treated with varying shapes of COM crystals by JC-1 fluorescent
staining and flow cytometry (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Effect of varying shapes of COM crystals on mitochondrial
membrane
potential (Δψm) in HK-2 cells. (A) The dot
plot of Δψm after incubation with varying shapes

group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
COM-HL treatment group vs COM-HLA treatment group, COM-TL treatment
group vs COM-TLA treatment group, #p <
0.05, ##p < 0.01.

The ratio of cells with low ΔΨm (green fluorescent)
in the control group was only 2.37%. The low ΔΨm ratio
increased in the range of 6.22–8.60% after the treatment of
COM crystals with various shapes. This result indicated that COM crystal
exposure caused mitochondrial depolarization in different degrees.
The COM-HL single crystal caused a decrease in ΔΨm of
6.22%, which is significantly lower than the decrease caused by COM-HLA
(7.59%, p < 0.01). The low ΔΨm ratio
in the COM-TL single crystal-treated group was significantly higher
than that in the COM-TLA-treated group (p < 0.01).
Excessive ROS generation caused by crystal exposure may explain the
decrease in intracellular ΔΨm.

2.8 Observation
of Cell Apoptosis and Necrosis
Induced by COM Crystals with Various Shapes
The characteristic
morphological changes in the cells as a result of the treatment with
COM crystals with different morphologies were evaluated by adopting
acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells in the fluorescent
microscopic analysis (Figure 8). The control-viable cells showed uniformly green fluorescing
nuclei and a highly organized structure. After treating the cells
with the COM crystals with four different shapes, we observed cytological
changes, such as necrosis in cells with red fluorescing nuclei and
cellular and nuclear swelling. The COM-HLA-treated cells were more
seriously injured than the cells treated with COM-HL; the COM-HLA
crystals caused significant cell necrosis. For the COM-TL- and COM-TLA-treated
groups, the number of necrotic cells in the aggregate-treated group
was obviously lower than that in the single crystal-treated group,
and the COM-TL-treated group presented some apoptotic cells with condensed
or fragmented chromatin.

2.9 Quantitative Analysis of Cell Apoptosis and
Necrosis Induced by COM Crystals with Various Shapes
To assess
the nature of various shapes of COM crystal-induced cell death, we
performed flow cytometric analysis to quantify the apoptotic and necrotic
cells using Annexin V/PI double staining (Figure 9). Annexin V staining was applied to reveal
the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (apoptosis), whereas PI
was applied to reveal the loss of plasma membrane integrity (necrosis).

Figure 9 Cell death

crystals for 12 h. (A) The representative dot plot of apoptosis and
necrosis. Quadrants Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 denote the ratio of necrotic
cells, late apoptotic cells, normal cells, and early-stage apoptotic
cells, respectively. (B) Quantitative results of apoptosis and necrosis.
Crystal concentration: 400 μg/mL. Compared with control group,
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. COM-HL
treatment group vs COM-HLA treatment group, COM-TL treatment group
vs COM-TLA treatment group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01.

The exposure time was extended to 12 h to clearly distinguish
the
changes in cell apoptosis and the necrosis rate. Quadrants Q1, Q2,
Q3, and Q4 denote the ratios of necrotic cells, late apoptotic cells,
normal cells, and early apoptotic cells, respectively. The COM crystals
with four different shapes mainly caused necrotic cell death, with
COM-TL inducing some apoptotic cell death in the HK-2 cells. COM-HLA
with sharp corners caused 19.55% cell death, which was obviously higher
than that observed in the COM-HL single crystal-treated group (15.17%, p < 0.01). COM-TL single crystal exhibited higher toxicity
in the HK-2 cells in comparison with COM-TLA; the two COM crystals
caused 22.2 and 12.07% cell death, respectively.

2.10 Quantitative Determination of Crystal Adhesion
on the Cell Surface
Crystal adhesion on the cell surface
is an important stage in the process of stone formation. COM crystals
were fluorescently labeled with FITC-IgG, and the FITC-positive cells
were counted with a flow cytometer (Figure 10). A crystal adhesion experiment was carried
out at 4 °C, under which the cellular active transport process
was inhibited and only the adhesion process proceeded.

Figure 10 Quantification
of the adhesion amount of COM crystals with various
shapes on the cell surface by flow cytometer. (A) Histogram of the
percentage of FITC-positive cells. (B) Quantitative results of adherent
crystals. [A] FITC-A means fluorescent intensity; B means percentages
of cells with adherent fluorescent COM crystals. Crystal concentration:
400 μg/mL, treatment time: 1 h. Compared with control group,
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. COM-HL
treatment group vs COM-HLA treatment group, COM-TL treatment group
vs COM-TLA treatment group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01.

The adhesion amount of the COM crystals on the HK-2 cell
surface
decreased in the order of COM-TL > COM-HL > COM-TLA > COM-HLA.
For
the single crystals of COM-TL and COM-HL, the adhesion amount on the
cell surface was positively related to their specific surface area;
that is, the crystal with the highest specific surface area showed
the greatest adhesion amount on the cell surface. For COM-TLA and
COM-HLA, the specific surface area did not reflect the real contact
area between the crystal and the cell because the aggregates were
not in close contact with the cell surface. The single crystals showed
an obviously larger contact area than their corresponding aggregates
from the morphology observation, and the adhesion amount of single
crystals was significantly higher than that of the aggregates. Sheng
et al.14 also confirmed that the aggregation
of crystals can hide their main crystal face, thereby reducing the
contact area and adhesion force between the crystal and the cell.

3 Discussion
Previous studies on the effect
of the crystal shape mainly focused
on the influence of spheroidal or rodlike particles;15−17 however, the formed crystals in vivo are often nonspherical and
show regular angles or an aggregate form.4,5 All
of the crystal faces in a spheroidal particle are isotropic, whereas
the faces in a nonspherical particle show different atomic arrangements,
atomic densities, and charge densities. All of these factors cause
differences in cell–particle interactions.

In this study,
four different shapes of COM crystals were synthesized
by altering the reactant concentration, reaction temperature, stirring
speed, and additive. COM-HL was prepared under the condition of zero
additive, and COM-HLA aggregate was obtained by adding NaCl during
the crystal preparation process. Similarly, COM-TL was prepared as
a result of the addition of Na3Cit, and COM-TLA aggregate
was obtained by adding Na3Cit and NaCl. Lesser physical
property differences were observed for the crystals obtained using
the same additive than the crystals obtained using different additives.
The aggregated crystals showed a larger specific surface area, a smaller
intensity ratio of I1̅01/I010, and a lower absolute value of ζ potential
than those of their single crystals (COM-HLA vs COM-HL, COM-TLA vs
COM-TL). Thus, we mainly discuss the toxicity difference of the crystals
obtained using the same additive.

The concentration of physiological
CaOx crystals is closely associated
with the supersaturation degree of CaOx in urine. Hallson et al.18 measured the concentration of the CaOx crystal
not exceeding 4 μm diameter in 53 samples, the results showed
that in 15 of the cases, the crystal concentration exceeds 10 μmol/L
(1.46 μg/mL) and in 4 of them exceeds 100 μmol/L (14.6
μg/mL); the concentrations were much higher than the normal
median value of 2 μmol/L (0.29 μg/mL). To speed up the
construction of the damage model and make the damage difference become
more obvious, the used concentration of COM crystals’ in vitro
experiment was often higher than the physiological crystalluria concentration.
The concentration used in our study ranged from 200 to 800 μg/mL,
which was consistent with most previous studies.3,19 The
adopted concentration of CaOx crystals by Hovda et al.3 and Mulay et al.19 is 147–735
and 30–1000 μg/mL, respectively.

3.1 Toxicity
Differences of COM Crystals of Varying
Shapes in Renal Epithelial Cells
COM-TL showed a thin hexagonal
lozenge morphology, which exhibited larger (1̅01) faces than
those of the other three COM crystals. The force between the (1̅01)
face and the cell surface was stronger than that between the (010)
face and cell surface because the Ca2+ ion density of the
(1̅01) face (0.0542 Ca2+/A2) was approximately
63% higher than that of the (010) face (0.0333 Ca2+/A2).20 Sheng et al.21 also demonstrated that the adhesive force of the (1̅01)
face to the carboxyl group-modified tip of atomic force microscopy
is 4 times stronger than that of the (010) face. Therefore, the interaction
between COM-TL and HK-2 cells should theoretically be the greatest
among the four crystals. At the same time, the (1̅01) faces
of COM-HLA and COM-TLA are bonded together as “fans”
to reduce the total (1̅01) plane area such that these (1̅01)
faces are effectively shielded from binding to renal tubule cells.22 In terms of crystal faces, these aggregates
should all elicit less toxicity than their corresponding individual
crystals, but the toxicity of COM-HLA was higher than that of COM-HL
in the HK-2 cells. Other factors should be affecting crystal toxicity.
Therefore, we conducted a series of cell assays to reveal the mechanism
of toxicity variation.

The morphologies of the cells treated
with the COM crystals of four different shapes showed obvious changes.
The typical features of necrosis, including cellular and nuclear swelling,
were observed (Figure 3). The COM crystal treatment caused LDH release (Figure 4) and an improvement in PI-positive
staining (Figure 5).
These effects indicated the rupture of the cell membrane. As the plasma
membrane is directly linked to and functionally integrated with the
underlying actin-based cytoskeleton, cell–crystal interactions
can be expected to cause the rearrangement of actin.23 Both COM-HLA and COM-TLA produced obviously higher membrane
damage than their corresponding single crystals. Numerous sharp corners
became exposed when the crystals aggregated. This condition easily
caused acute physical damage to the cell membrane, which eventually
ruptured. Interestingly, the extent of the damage of the cell membrane
caused by the COM crystals did not show the same change rule as that
observed for cell viability (Figure 2).

To further reveal the toxicity mechanism of
the COM crystals with
varying shapes, we detected the intracellular biological indicators.
ROS generation and oxidative stress produced by exogenous particles
are considered to be important factors associated with particle toxicity.24,25 Generally, particles with a large surface area per unit mass produce
large amounts of superoxide radicals and other types of ROS.26 By contrast, the ROS generation induced by the
aggregates and single crystals in the current work did not show the
same change rule as that observed for the specific surface area of
COM crystals. Although the SBET of COM-TLA
is higher than that of COM-TL, the ROS generation amount caused by
COM-TLA is lower than that caused by COM-TL. Thus, apart from the
specific surface area of crystals, the real contact area between the
crystal and the cell surface should be an important influencing factor.
For the micron-grade crystals, the aggregated crystals barely touched
the cell surface; thus, we cannot sufficiently judge ROS generation
ability in aggregates according to their detected specific surface
areas. The contact area between COM-TL and the cell surface was obviously
greater than that between COM-TLA and the cell surface; thus, the
COM-TL crystals caused extensive ROS generation. The sharpness of
crystals should be another important factor that affects ROS generation
ability during exposure to cells. The COM-HLA crystals showed a larger SBET than their corresponding COM-HL crystals.
More importantly, COM-HLA exhibited sharply angled edges and tips,
which caused serious damage to the cell membrane; such damage led
to the upregulation of membrane-associated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and stimulated the generation of •O2– via NADPH oxidase.27 Therefore, the generation of ROS in the COM-HLA-treated
group was higher than that in the COM-HL-treated group.

Apoptosis
and necrosis are often preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction
accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Although
the micron-sized COM crystals were not in direct contact with intracellular
organelles, all of the four types of COM crystals caused a decrease
in Δψm (Figure 7). Excessive intracellular ROS formation can overwhelm
the natural scavenging activity of cells and, in turn, induce mitochondrial
membrane permeability, ultrastructural mitochondrial damage, mitochondrial
depolarization, and respiratory chain disturbance.28 The amount of generated ROS was positively related to the
loss of Δψm. If mitochondrial damage is severe
and the generated ROS overwhelms the natural scavenging activity of
cells, cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis.29

Cell death is a complicated pathological process, which may
be
related to cell types, crystal concentration, exposure time, and even
the physicochemical properties of crystals.30 AO/PI staining observation and Annexin V/PI staining quantitative
analysis proved that the COM crystals with four different shapes all
caused cell death in some degree, mainly in the form of necrotic cell
death. Schepers et al.31 also indicated
that COM crystals cause acute inflammation-mediated necrotic cell
death in renal proximal tubular cells. CaOx crystal exposure can also
induce necrotic cell death and apoptotic cell death simultaneously.32

The cell death mechanism induced by the
COM crystals of various
shapes is summarized as a schematic in Figure 11. When particles attach to the cell surface,
these reactive particles damage the cell membranes via oxidative stress
or direct interaction, leading to the breakdown of membrane lipids
and imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis.33 Cell-membrane rupture leads to the imbalance of osmotic
pressure across membranes, which can disrupt lysosomal structures
and ultimately lead to cell necrosis.34 From the conductivity variation of the COM crystals with four different
shapes, we observed that the conductivities of COM-HLA and COM-TL
were higher than those of COM-HL and COM-TLA, respectively; that is,
COM-HLA and COM-TL should release large amounts of Ca2+ and Ox2– ions to the medium when exposed to cell
culture; moreover, they can easily cause the imbalance of osmotic
pressure, which leads to serious necrosis. COM-TL crystals possess
a blunt morphology and a large active (1̅01) face; thus, the
damage induced by these crystals should be particularly homogeneous.
In this study, COM-TL induced obviously greater cell apoptosis in
comparison with the other crystals. These injured cells provide numerous
active sites to induce crystal nucleation and promote further crystallization,
crystal retention, and development of stone nidus.

Figure 11 Proposed
schematic illustration of the injury mechanism of HK-2
cells after exposure to varying shapes of COM crystals. Crystals with
greater Ca2+ ion-rich (1̅01) active crystal faces
and sharp aggregates have higher cytotoxicity on renal epithelial
cells.

3.2 Potential
Stone Risk Differences Caused by
COM Crystals with Different Shapes
The urine of normal and
kidney stone patients contains numerous calcium oxalate crystals,
which often exhibit different sizes, shapes, and phases.4,35 These generated crystals can attach to epithelial cell membranes,
especially in injured epithelial cells. The presence of crystals on
the epithelial surface effectively reduces the luminal diameter, impedes
the flow of urine and the passage of any crystals formed upstream,
and increases the likelihood that the passing crystals will adhere
to the crystals already attached to the tubular walls. The crystal
shape can affect the crystal flow through the renal tubules. Generally,
we assume that urinary flow through the renal tubules is laminar,
in which case the flow velocity near the epithelium should be extremely
small. Thus, crystals near the epithelial surface travel at a significantly
slow speed.36 Such condition increases
the contact time between urinary crystals and epithelial cell membranes.
Crystal movement from the renal tubules can be influenced by their
morphology because of the Stokes drag.37 The Stokes drag is positively related to the specific surface area
of urinary crystallites.38 The specific
surface areas of COM-HLA and COM-TLA are higher than those of COM-Hl
and COM-TL, respectively (Table 1). A high Stokes drag leads to a long contact time
during crystal flow through renal tubules. In other words, these aggregated
crystals flow slower than their corresponding single crystals under
the same size.

All models of CaOx nephrolithiasis indicate that
crystal aggregation is involved in crystal retention within the kidneys;
specifically, crystal aggregation exerts a considerable effect on
the crystal size and shape.39 CaOx crystalluria
is common in both stone formers and healthy people, but stone formers
excrete more crystal aggregates than normal subjects.40 The urine of stone formers is less inhibitory of crystal
aggregation, and the reduction in aggregation inhibition is proportional
to the severity of stone disease.37 The
aggregation of crystals can considerably affect the particle size,
and aggregated crystals commonly exhibit sharp corners. Aggregates
more easily cause cell-membrane damage in comparison with their corresponding
single crystals. In this work, COM-HLA with sharp corners caused more
serious local acute injuries on the cell surface in comparison with
COM-HL. When urine flowed through the renal tubules, the amount of
COM-TL with large active (1̅01) faces that adhered to the cell
surface was greater than that of the other crystals (Figure 10). These adhered crystals
further induced intracellular ROS generation, followed by serious
intracellular organelle injury and increased stone risk. Therefore,
the sharpness of crystals and the contact area between the crystal
and cell surface are the two important factors that affect cell toxicity
and stone risk.

A high salt diet is an important etiological
factor for inducing
hypertension, heart disease, and cerebral hemorrhage; however, whether
a high salt diet can affect kidney stones is unknown. Sodium metabolism
mainly occurs in the kidney, and a high salt diet aggravates the metabolic
burden of the kidney and causes renal inflammation.41,42 In crystal preparation experiment, we found that NaCl addition promoted
the aggregation of CaOx crystals (Figure 1b,d). Whether high NaCl concentration can
aggravate crystal aggregation in physiological conditions is not very
clear, but it has proved that high salt intake can increase calcium
excretion; every 100 mmol of increase in dietary sodium results in
an approximately 25 mg rise in urinary calcium.43 Calcium loss is associated with an increased risk of stone
formation. Research has shown that men in the high calcium intake
group have a 50% lower risk of recurrence of stone formation in comparison
with those in the low calcium intake group.44 Therefore, high salt intake may be an important risk factor for
inducing stone formation.

4 Conclusions
This study compared the toxicity in HK-2 cells caused by COM crystals
with different shapes and aggregation states. Crystal toxicity in
renal epithelial cells was closely associated with the area of the
active (1̅01) face and crystal sharpness. The overall damage
in the cells was determined according to both the exterior damage
and interior damage. The aggregation behavior of the crystals increased
the exposed edges and corners but decreased the crystal–cell
contact area. The aggregation of sharp crystals aggravated cell injury,
whereas the aggregation of blunt crystals weakened cell injury. The
crystals with a large (1̅01) active face showed a high toxicity
in the HK-2 cells, and they easily adhered to the cell surface. This
study can serve as a theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism
of kidney stone formation and determining the causes of stone formation
on the basis of the stone shape.

Human kidney proximal tubular epithelial
(HK-2) cells were cultured in a DMEM culture medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin–100 μg/mL streptomycin
antibiotics with pH 7.4 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified
environment. Upon reaching an 80–90% confluent monolayer, cells
were blown gently after trypsin digestion to form cell suspension
for the following cell experiment.

For the preparation of varying
shapes of COM crystal suspension, a certain amount of COM crystals
were UV sterilized for 40 min. Then, the COM crystals were dispersed
in a serum-free DMEM culture medium at a concentration of 800 μg/mL
and treated with ultrasound for 10 min to obtain uniform crystal conditions.
For cell experiments, the cells were seeded in culture plates at a
density of 1 × 105 cells/mL and allowed to attach
for 24 h and then treated with varying shapes of COM crystals suspended
in DMEM for a certain time. Cells maintained in DMEM without COM crystals
were used as the control group.

5.2.3 Cell
Viability Assay
The cytotoxicity
of varying shapes of COM crystals was evaluated by the CCK-8 viability
assay. One hundred microliters of cell suspension with a cell concentration
of 1 × 105 cells/mL was inoculated per well in 96-well
plates for 24 h. The culture medium was removed by suction, and the
cells were washed twice with PBS. The experimental model was divided
into two groups: (A) control group, in which only the serum-free culture
medium was added; (B) treatment group with COM crystals, in which
cells were exposed to 200, 400, and 800 μg/mL of COM-HL, COM-HLA,
COM-TL, or COM-TLA crystals with a serum-free culture medium, respectively.
Each experiment was repeated in five-parallel wells. After incubation

for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed thrice with PBS.
After fixation, the cells were stained with hematoxylin stain and
incubated for 15 min. Then cells were washed with distilled water

wells without the drug treatment (sample control wells); (C) cells
without drug treatment for the subsequent cleavage of the wells (sample
maximum enzyme activity control wells); and (D) treated group with
COM-HL, COM-HLA, COM-TL, and COM-TLA crystals at concentrations of
200, 400, 800 μg/mL for 6 h (drug-treated wells). Each experiment

h incubation, the supernatant was removed by suction and the cells
were washed three times with PBS, and then the cells were stained
by 4 μmol/L PI solution for 10 min. Again the cells were washed
three times with PBS followed by observing the dead cells by a fluorescence
microscope. The nuclei were stained red, indicating late apoptotic
or necrotic cells.

Quantitative analysis: the cells were inoculated

COM-HLA, COM-TL, and COM-TLA crystals for 6 h, the cells were suspended
by pipetting, followed by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min). The supernatant
was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with PBS and centrifuged
again to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were resuspended by adding
and thoroughly mixing 500 μL of PBS in a microcentrifuge tube.
The samples were then stained with 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) for 20 min and analyzed by the flow cytometer.
Each experiment was conducted in three-parallel replicates.

5.2.8 Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
(Δψm)

6 h, the supernatant was aspirated and the cells were washed twice
with PBS and digested with 0.25% trypsin. DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum was then added to terminate digestion. The cells
were suspended by pipetting, followed by centrifugation (1000 rpm,
5 min). The supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were washed with
PBS and centrifuged again to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were
resuspended by adding and thoroughly mixing 200 μL of PBS in
a microcentrifuge tube. Finally, the samples were stained with JC-1
dye and then analyzed by the flow cytometer. Each experiment was conducted
in three-parallel replicates.

5.2.9 Cell
Apoptosis and Necrosis Observation
by AO/PI Staining
Apoptosis and necrosis induced by varying
shapes of COM crystals in HK-2 cells was observed by a fluorescence
microscope with an AO/PI double-staining assay. Briefly, the cells
were harvested after 12 h of exposure to 400 μg/mL COM-HL, COM-HLA,
COM-TL, and COM-TLA crystals and then stained using AO/PI dye (1:1,
10 μmol/L) for 15 min. After the color separation by 0.1 mol/L
CaCl2 for 1 min, the cells were observed by a fluorescence
microscope.

5.2.10 Cell Apoptosis and Necrosis
Detection
Apoptosis and necrosis induced by varying shapes

double-staining assay. Briefly, the cells were harvested after 12
h of exposure to 400 μg/mL COM-HL, COM-HLA, COM-TL, and COM-TLA
crystals, and then stained using an Annexin V-FITC/PI cell death assay
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. About 1.5
× 105 cells were collected and washed with PBS (centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min). The cells were resuspended in 200 μL
of binding buffer. Afterward, 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC was added
and then incubated in darkness at room temperature for 10 min. The
cells were again resuspended in 200 μL of binding buffer and
stained with 5 μL of PI. The prepared cells were then analyzed
using a flow cytometer. Each experiment was conducted in three-parallel
replicates.

5.2.11 Quantitative Analysis
of Adherent COM Crystals
by Flow Cytometry
The adhesion amount of FITC-IgG fluorescence-labeled
COM crystals of various shapes on HK-2 cells was measured by a flow
cytometer. The experimental model was divided into two groups: (a)
control group: in which only a normal serum-free culture medium was
added; (b) adhesion group: cells were exposed to 400 μg/mL COM-HL,
COM-HLA, COM-TL, and COM-TLA crystals for 1 h. Afterward, the culture
medium was removed by suction and the cells were washed twice with
PBS (to eliminate the unbound crystals) followed by trypsinization,
respectively. The cells were resuspended with 200 μL of PBS.
The cellular adhesion of crystals was then quantitatively determined
by a flow cytometer; cells with positive FITC signal were directly
counted as those with adherent crystals. Each experiment was conducted
in three-parallel replicates.

5.2.12 Statistical

Statistical
analyses were performed using the SPSS 13.0 software. Data were expressed
as the mean ± SD. Multiple group comparisons were performed using
one-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey post hoc test. If p < 0.05, there was a significant difference; if p < 0.01, the difference was extremely significant; and if p > 0.05, there was no significant difference. The symbols
* and ** are used to indicate the significance between the COM-treated
groups and control group, and the symbols # and ## are used to indicate the significance between the COM-HL treatment
group and COM-HLA treatment group or the COM-TL treatment group and
COM-TLA treatment group.
