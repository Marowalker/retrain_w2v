Halloysite,
a natural clay with a hollow tubular structure, was
studied as a catalyst for the esterification of biomass-derived carboxylic
acids (levulinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, and succinic acid)
with four different alcohols (MeOH, EtOH, n-PrOH,
and n-BuOH). Reaction conditions were optimized (10
mol % halloysite, 170 °C, 24 h) and gave high yields of the corresponding
esters and diesters (>90%). The halloysite was easily recovered
and
recycled after washing and drying.

Introduction
Levulinic acid and
succinic acid (including the unsaturated analogs
fumaric acid and maleic acid) have been identified as among the top
10 value-added chemicals derived from biomass.1 Levulinic acid and succinic acid derivatives have broad application
as chemical building blocks for fine chemicals.1,2 Biomass-derived
succinates have been used as monomer precursors for polyether synthesis,
while levulinate esters have been employed as octane boosters for
gasoline and extenders for diesel fuel.2−8 Esters of levulinic and succinic acid can be readily prepared by
a variety of esterification methods from simple alcohols catalyzed
by both homogeneous and heterogeneous acid catalysts. Mineral acids
are cost-effective homogeneous catalysts that produce alkyl levulinates
and dialkyl succinates in high yields. However, heterogeneous acid
catalysts offer the advantages of easy removal from the reaction media
facilitating product purification and catalyst recyclability. Therefore,
a variety of solid acid catalysts derived from a plethora of chemically
modified solid supports have been investigated as catalysts for this
conversion.9−17

Halloysite (Hal) is a natural 1:1 aluminosilicate clay which
is
commonly found in weathered rocks and soil. The clay is chemically
similar to kaolinite; however, it is commonly found as a hollow tubular
nanostructure.18,19 Because aluminosilicate
chemistry is generally not toxic and is very durable, halloysite has
many advantages in chemical processes.20,21 Studies have
shown that halloysite has a high biocompatibility and a high thermal
stability, making it much safer to work with than Brønsted or
Lewis acids. Also, because of its abundance, halloysite is easily
obtained, cheap, and even reusable.19 A
recent study demonstrated the effectiveness of halloysite as a catalyst
for the conversion of lauric acid to corresponding methyl laurate
and ethyl laurate esters.22 With a conversion
rate of over 90% for ester formation and an optimum catalyst loading
of 12% (w/w), it was of interest to explore the scope and utility
of this clay for the development of sustainable conversions of biomass-derived
substrates into fine chemical building blocks and fuel additives.
Therefore, as part of an ongoing study in our labs aimed at the development
of halloysite-based materials, we sought to explore the use of raw
halloysite as an esterification catalyst for the preparation of several
important biomass-derived esters.

Results and Discussion
Initially, esterification of levulinic acid with methanol to form
methyl levulinate was explored with commercially available raw halloysite.
This system was used to identify optimized molar ratios for the reactants/catalyst
as well as identify optimized reaction conditions (°C, h) because
of the ease with which the reaction could be monitored by simple thin-layer
chromatography and the product could be isolated and characterized
by NMR. The molar amount of the halloysite used in the reaction was
based upon the unit cell of Al2Si2O5(OH)4·2H2O (MW 294.19). In a typical reaction,
the acid, alcohol, and halloysite were combined in a sealed stainless
steel reaction vessel and heated to an elevated temperature in a silicon
oil bath. The reaction vessel was then allowed to cool, and the product
ester was isolated and characterized. An optimum molar ratio of acid/alcohol/halloysite
of 1:24:0.1 was found to be ideal for the easy handling of the reaction
slurry. Although the esterification could be successfully executed
with lower alcohol (1:12:0.1) concentrations, less alcohol gave poor
dispersion of the halloysite and made isolation of the product and
the recovery of the halloysite more difficult. Alternatively, increasing
the amount of halloysite did not significantly improve yields of the
ester. As summarized in Table 1, temperature and time seemed to have the most significant
effect on the yield of the ester. Consistent with the earlier report,
high temperature was required to drive the halloysite-catalyzed esterification
to completion. In our system, we found it necessary to heat the reaction
vessel in an oil bath set to a temperature of 170 °C. A reaction
time of 24 h gave the maximum acid conversion and product yield (99%),
while shorter reaction times led to incomplete conversion of the acid.

With optimized conditions established
for levulinic acid in methanol,
the esterification of levulinic acid with other short chain alcohols
(EtOH, n-PrOH, and n-BuOH) was investigated
(Table 2). Using the
optimized conditions established for the methyl ester, the yields
of the corresponding ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl levulinates were nearly quantitative. Moreover,
the esters exhibited a high degree of purity with little more than
filtration required for work-up. The success of this procedure prompted
further investigation to confirm halloysite-catalyzed esterification
as a viable method for the conversion of other biomass-derived acids
into esters. As summarized in Table 2, methyl esters of the C6-carbohydrate-derived succinic
acid and fumaric acid could be prepared using the optimized conditions
in high yields. In a similar fashion to levulinic acid, the dimethyl
esters of succinic acid and fumaric acid were obtained in 96 and 92%
yield, respectively. For the diacids, the alcohol concentration was
maintained and the same molar ratio of diacid/alcohol/halloysite (1:24:0.1)
was used. As with levulinic acid, the diacids were readily converted
into the corresponding dimethyl, diethyl, di-n-propyl,
and di-n-butyl succinates and fumarates in excellent
yield and purity. These conditions were also suitable for conversion
of the cis-isomer, maleic acid, into dialkyl maleates
in 90–95% yield.23 It was notable
that despite the elevated temperature, isomerization of the carbon
double bond to give the trans fumarate esters was
not observed.

The halloysite used in this study
has origins from geological deposits
at Dragon Mine, Utah (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). The morphology
of this polydispersed nanoclay has been well characterized and reported
to be 90% halloysite with the remaining 10% of the material consisting
of kaolinite, quartz and gibbsite.24 As
a catalyst, this halloysite was found to be durable and chemically
robust. It was superior to other clay catalysts like kaolite25 and montorillonite26 which under the same conditions gave inferior yields of methyl levulinate
(<65%, Table 2).
The halloysite could be recovered from the reaction mixture by simple
vacuum filtration and reused without loss of activity. There was no
apparent structural change to the halloysite after the esterification
reaction. Based upon X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles (Figure 1a), the positions of the indexed
basal reflections (001, 002, and 003) of the raw halloysite (7.23,
3.59 and 2.33 Å) remained unchanged in the recycled halloysite
(7.18, 3.57, and 2.34 Å). These results were consistent with
the diffraction pattern of the dehydrated form of halloysite (7 Å
form) as opposed to the hydrated form of the clay (10 Å form).27 Further visual inspection of the raw and recycled
materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1b) revealed that there was
no apparent change to the tubular structure of the catalyst.

raw halloysite (red) and recycled halloysite (blue).
(b) TEM image of raw halloysite. (c) TEM image of recycled halloysite.

As illustrated in Figure 2, recycling studies with halloysite showed
that the catalyst
could be cycled through at least six consecutive esterification reactions
with no loss of activity and excellent isolated yields of the methyl
levulinate in each trial. In these studies, the halloysite was collected
by vacuum filtration and washed with the corresponding alcohol used
in the esterification. The recovered clay was then further rinsed
with deionized water and dried at 120 °C overnight. This afforded
the recovered halloysite as a free-flowing powder that would be used
in subsequent reactions. Using this method of recovery, the halloysite
could be used in different reaction systems with no observed cross-contamination
of esters.

Figure 2 Halloysite recycling studies.

To demonstrate further the utility of halloysite as a catalyst
for the esterification reaction, 100 mmol–scale reactions were
performed with levulinic acid, succinic acid, and fumaric acid with
selected alcohols. The scaled optimized conditions afforded the monoesters
methyl and ethyl levulinate in 99% yield. In addition, the diesters,
diethyl succinate (99% yield), and dibutyl fumarate (95% yield) were
obtained in nearly quantitative yields.

In summary, we have
shown that the natural clay, halloysite, is
a cost-effective, highly efficient, and easily recyclable catalyst
for the esterification of bio-mass-derived carboxylic acids (levulinic
acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, and succinic acid). The optimized
reaction conditions (10 mol % halloysite, 170 °C, 24 h) were
scalable and represent a green process for the preparation of levulinate
and succinate esters. Halloysite, with its unique tubular nanostructure,
exhibited remarkable chemical reactivity superior to other clays.
Further development of halloysite-based reactions and halloysite-based
nanomaterials is under investigation and will be reported in due course.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All reactions were carried out
in a stainless-steel reaction vessel suspended in a stirred silicon
oil bath. Halloysite clay was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (source:
Applied Minerals, Inc. Dragon Mine, Utah USA) and was used without
modification. All other chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar,
Sigma-Aldrich and VWR. All chemicals were used as received without
further purification or modification. Reaction mixtures were filtered
prior to work-up using Fisherbrand filter paper, P2-grade [porosity:
fine (particle retention: 1–5 μm)]. 1H NMR
spectra were recorded at r.t. in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument operating at
a frequency of 300 MHz for 1H NMR. 1H chemical
shifts were referenced to the DMSO solvent signal (2.50 ppm) or the
CHCl3 solvent signal (7.26 ppm). Halloysite XRD measurements
were performed on a Philips X’Pert diffractometer utilizing
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a curved graphite
monochromator at a voltage of 45 kV and a current of 40 mA. Halloysite
TEM images were obtained on a JEOL 2010 equipped with an EDAX genesis
energy-dispersive spectroscopy system, operated at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV and an emission current of 109 μA.

General
Procedure
To a clean dry stainless-steel reaction
pressure vessel was added the carboxylic acid (10.0 mmol), alcohol
(240 mmol), halloysite (0.249 g, 1.00 mmol), and a stir bar. The reaction
vessel was sealed and placed in an oil bath at 170 °C and allowed
to stir for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to
room temperature for 30 min. The halloysite was filtered using vacuum
filtration. The halloysite filter cake was washed with alcohol (10
mL) and set aside for later use. The alcohol from the combined filtrates
was removed under reduced pressure. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution
(10 mL) was added to the resulting oil residue, and the mixture was
extracted with EtOAc (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic portions
were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and
filtered, and the solvent was removed under vacuum to afford the ester
(or diester) in pure form as determined by 1H NMR.
