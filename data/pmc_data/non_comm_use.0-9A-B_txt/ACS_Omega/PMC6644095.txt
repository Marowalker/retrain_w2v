Indoles
and benzofurans have been synthesized using a graphene
oxide-grafted aminobisphosphine–PdII complex (GO@PNP–Pd)
under copper-free condition. A range of indole and benzofuran derivatives
have been made by the reaction of N-protected 2-iodoanilines
and 2-iodophenols with terminal acetylenes in presence of GO@PNP–Pd.
The activity of the aminobisphosphine–PdII complex
remains the same under both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.
Finally, the recycling ability of the immobilized catalyst (GO@PNP–Pd)
has been examined for five consecutive runs with appreciable conversion.

Introduction
Indoles and benzofurans
are an important class of heterocyclic
motifs found in several natural products,1,2 pharmaceutically
active compounds,3,4 and organic materials.5−7 During past years, several synthetic methods have been developed
for the synthesis of indole and benzofuran derivatives.8−12 The most convenient way is the Sonogashira coupling of ortho-halogenated
phenol/aniline with a terminal alkyne, followed by the cyclization
of the hydroxyl/amine group with the triple bond.13,14 A number of homogeneous catalytic systems have been known for this
tandem coupling/cyclization reaction.13−22

Heterogeneous catalysts always offer numerous advantages over
homogeneous
systems because they include several advantages such as easy separation
of a catalyst from the reaction mixture and high recyclability. Although
few heterogeneous systems have been known for such tandem coupling/cyclization
reactions,23−28 many drawbacks are associated with these methodologies such as high
catalyst loading, use of copper as the cocatalyst, use of external
ligand, high reaction temperature, and so forth.

In recent years,
graphene oxide (GO), a two-dimensional scaffold
of carbon, has become a promising support material for the grafting
of homogeneous materials.29−33 The presence of ample oxygen functionalities makes GO more dispersible
in polar solvents and makes GO more functionalizable. The functionalized
GO materials found extensive applications in the area of heterogeneous
catalysis.29−33 Recently, we have reported the immobilization of the short bite
aminobisphosphine–PdII complex [PdCl2{(Ph2P)2N(CH2)3Si(OMe)3}] (PNP–PdII) over GO (Figure 1) and utilized the composite
material (GO@PNP–Pd) in C–C coupling and cyanation reactions.33 Herein, we report the utility of the composite
material (GO@PNP–Pd) in the tandem coupling/cyclization reaction
for the synthesis of indole and benzofuran derivatives.

Figure 1 GO@PNP–Pd
and its application.

Results and Discussion
To begin our study, the composite
material GO@PNP–Pd was
prepared following a previously reported procedure.33 Indole synthesis has been started with N-protected anilines. At the outset of the investigation, N-tosyl-2-iodoaniline and phenyl acetylene were taken as
model substrates to identify the optimal condition for this tandem
coupling/cyclization reaction (Table 1). Initially, various polar and nonpolar solvents have
been screened under inert (N2) atmosphere (entries 1–6).
Among them, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served the best result and furnished
the desired annulated product in excellent yield. Extensive screening
of the loading of the catalyst elucidated that 1.5 mol % was enough
to catalyze this annulation (entry 7). Subsequently, bases were also
screened, and Cs2CO3 provided the excellent
conversion (entry 8) at 70 °C. Further decrease in temperature
resulted in the low yield of the product (entry 9). The overall optimal
reaction condition is shown in entry 6 in Table 1.

c Reaction performed at 50 °C.

To examine the scope and the
limitation of this cascade reaction,
a series of substituted N-protected-2-iodo anilines
and alkynes have been investigated, and the corresponding results
are briefly summarized in Table 2. Aromatic alkynes bearing both electron-releasing
and -withdrawing substituents coupled efficiently with N-tosyl-2-iodoaniline and afforded the cyclized product in good to
excellent yield (compounds 3a–3c). Similarly,
hetero aromatic alkyne (3-ethynylthiophene) and aliphatic alkyne (1-octyne)
smoothly gave the expected products in high yield (compounds 3d and 3e). However, ortho-substituted alkyne
such as 1-bromo-2-ethynylbenzene rendered the corresponding annulated
product in moderate yield (62%, compound 3f). N-Tosyl-2-iodo-4-methylaniline reacted smoothly with three
different alkynes, and respective indole derivatives were obtained
in excellent yield (compounds 3g–3i). On the other
hand, the reactivity of N-boc-2-iodoaniline was quite
different from that of N-tosyl-2-iodoaniline. Most
of the solvents employed during the optimization reaction of N-tosyl-2-iodoaniline provided the indole derivative, but N-boc-2-iodoaniline afforded the same only in DMSO, whereas
a Sonogashira coupling product (compound 3j) was formed
in other cases. Reaction of N-boc-2-iodoaniline with
phenylacetylene and 1-octyne in DMSO rendered the cyclized products 3k and 3l in good yield. The reaction of N-boc-2-iodoaniline with electron-releasing acetylenes such
as 4-ethynyltoluene and 1-tert-butyl-4-ethynylbenzene
afforded a mixture of boc-protected and -deprotected products, and
the boc-free indoles are the major products. Compounds 3m, 3n, and 3o have been isolated in pure
form. Finally, the reaction of 2-iodoaniline with phenylacetylene
under the present optimized condition generated a Sonogashira coupling
product (compound 3p) instead of a cyclized product.

at 70 °C under N2 for 8 h.

b Isolated yield.

After establishing the suitable reaction condition
for indole synthesis,
the efficacy of this protocol has been extended for the synthesis
of benzofurans. In a preliminary experiment, the tandem reaction has
been attempted using 1 mol % of GO@PNP–Pd (with respect to
Pd) in acetonitrile with 2-iodophenol and phenylacetylene as the model
substrate at 70 °C (Table 3). Using Et3N as a base, the desired product was
obtained in good yield within 8 h (entry 1). After that, the activity
of different inorganic bases has been examined, and Cs2CO3 proved to be the best (entries 2 and 3). Furthermore,
replacing acetonitrile with DMSO did not show any prominent result
(entry 4). Finally, variation in catalyst loading or reaction temperature
did not produce any significant changes in terms of yield of product
(entries 5 and 6). Therefore, entry 2 in Table 3 represents the optimized reaction condition.

c Reaction performed at room temperature.

To generalize the optimize condition, a range of substituted
2-iodophenol
and acetylene were screened, and the results are presented in Table 4. Initially, the impact
of substitution variation at terminal acetylenes was investigated
with 2-iodophenol. Phenyl acetylenes having electron-rich and electron-deficient
groups underwent cyclization smoothly and afforded corresponding products
in excellent yield (compounds 5a–5d). Ortho-substituted
alkyne such as 2-ethynylanisole gave the corresponding cyclized product
with good yield (compound 5e). Aliphatic alkyne (1-octyne)
underwent easy reaction and provided subsequent furan derivatives
in excellent yield (compound 5f). Afterward, substituted
iodophenols such as 2-iodo-4,6-dimethylphenol and 4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-methoxybenzaldehyde
were implicated for this cyclization reaction. The reaction of these
iodophenols with different aromatic, aliphatic, and hetero aromatic
alkynes proceeded very efficiently, and different benzofuran derivatives
were obtained in good to excellent yield (compounds 5g–5l).

was heated at 70 °C under N2 for 8 h.

b Isolated yield.

Finally, the catalytic activity of the GO-grafted
aminobisphosphine–PdII complex (GO@PNP–Pd)
was compared with its homogeneous
analogue, and it was found that the aminobisphosphine–PdII complex was equally active under both homogeneous and heterogeneous
conditions (Table 5).

For the recyclability experiment,
the GO@PNP–Pd catalyst
was recovered from both these reaction mixtures, washed with methanol,
dried under vacuum, and reused in another four catalytic cycles (Figure 2). Although a comparable
yield of benzofuran (5a) was obtained over five catalytic
cycles, a sharp drop in activity was observed after each catalytic
cycle of indole synthesis (3a). This drop in catalytic
activity might be due to the decomposition of the active catalyst
during the reaction carried out in DMSO, and this result was further
supported by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
the recovered material after 1st and 5th run (Figure 3).

Conclusions
The GO-grafted aminobisphosphine–PdII complex
(GO@PNP–Pd) has been utilized as an efficient catalyst for
the synthesis of 2-substituted indoles and benzofurans. A series of
indoles and benzofurans have been obtained by varying the substitution
over coupling partners. N-Tosyl-2-iodoaniline was
found to be more effective than N-boc-2-iodoaniline
during indole synthesis. The aminobisphosphine–PdII complex showed equal efficiency under both homogeneous and heterogeneous
conditions. Finally, the GO@PNP–Pd catalyst was recovered and
reused for four consecutive runs.

Experimental Section
General
Information
N-Protected anilines
have been prepared using the literature procedure with slight modification
and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR.34−36 Other chemicals were purchased and used directly. The 1H and 13C NMR (δ in ppm) spectra were obtained from
either a Bruker AVANCE 400 or 500 MHz spectrometer. The NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 solutions with CDCl3 as
an internal lock, and TMS was used as an internal standard for 1H NMR. Mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker maXis impact
LC-q-TOF mass spectrometer. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) analyses were carried out with an Agilent 7890A GC
system connected with a 5975C inert XL EI/CI MSD. TEM of the samples
was performed with a JEM 2100 and CM 200.
