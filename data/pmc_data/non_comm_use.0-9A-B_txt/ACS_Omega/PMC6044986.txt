The molluscicide
niclosamide is found in most of the wetlands of
China. The migration and transformation pathways, and degradation
kinetics of niclosamide in the plant–soil system was analyzed
by with the use of potting experiment. Experimental results showed
that degradation of niclosamide in rhizosphere soil fit the first-order
kinetics, and microorganisms played an important role in the degradation
of niclosamide. It was found that niclosamide degrades to form a series
of aromatic intermediate products both in soil and plants. Niclosamide
could be absorbed from soil to plant by the root and then migrate
to the stem. At an initial concentration of niclosamide of 2.11 mg·kg–1 in soil, the maximum residue of niclosamide in Artemisia somai aerial was 2.47 mg·kg–1 after 10 days of cultivation. This value is close to the pollution
maximum residue limit (3 mg·kg–1) in rice,
and niclosamide and its intermediates can remain about 43 days in
plants. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of niclosamide
in wetlands would have some risk in edible plants and was harmful
for human health.

==== Body
Introduction
Niclosamide
was the most efficient drug used in oncomelania control,
and was designed to kill schistosome cercaria, miracidium, and tapeworm.
Approximately 200 t of niclosamide was added directly to Poyang Lake
(China), and its degradation totally depends on natural methods such
as diffusion–migration, hydrolysis,1,2 photolysis,3,4 and biodegradation.5,6 Although the use of niclosamide
as a management strategy has been highly effective at controlling
oncomelania, niclosamide was toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms.7,8 Meanwhile, niclosamide could inhibit the growth of hydrophytes especially
phytoplankton.9 For example, niclosamide
could lead to the poisoning death of grass carp, chub, and ostracean.10,11 For this reason, there is a need to better understand the fate and
transformation products in lacustrine shoal.

The fate of niclosamide
degradation in the natural environmental
is not fully understood, but there were a few researches about it.
Sediment soil has the strong ability to absorb niclosamide, and the
organic content and clay composition in soil had significant impact
on niclosamide absorbance.1 Niclosamide
could diffuse and migrate in soil by water leaching.12 Niclosamide degrades through chemical reaction1,13 and photolysis3,14,15 in lacustrine shoal. Biodegradation is the main path of niclsoamide
degradation in the natural environment as aerobiotic and anaerobic
naturalized microorganisms have a high capability of degrading niclosamide.16 Graebing found that niclosamide could hydrolyze
to generate 5-chlorosalicylic acid and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline under
the effect of light;3 niclosamide in sediment
could also convert to 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline and 5-chlorosalicylic
acid whether in aerobic or anaerobic conditions.16

At present, the major research about niclosamide
was the lasting
active time and toxicity in soil or water environment, there was little
research in the literature about the migration and transformation
of niclosamide in a plant–soil system. Research on this topic
would benefit our understanding the degradation fate and pathway of
niclosamide in natural environment.

The objective of this work
was to study the degradation kinetics
and pathway of niclosamide in a soil–plant system, and provide
the degradation mechanism and risk data for niclosamide use. A plot
model was used to simulate the degradation and transformation of niclosamide
in the lacustrine shoal plant–soil system.

Results and Discussion
Characterize
of Niclosamide Degradation in Rhizosphere Soil
Degradation Kinetic of
Niclosamide in Different Rhizosphere
Soil
The residual concentration of niclosamide in carex,
Artemisia somai rhizosphere soil, and blank control soil after the
plants were potted was analyzed by HPLC, and the test results were
shown in Figure 1.
It can be seen from Figure 1 that the removal rate of niclosamide in three soil samples
was the fastest in the first 3 days after the plant was potted, and
the removal rate of niclosamide in carex, Artemisia somai rhizosphere
soil, and blank soil was 27.7%, 23.1%, and 18.9%, respectively. The
recovery rate of niclosamide added in soil was 88.65%–92.85%,
and standard deviation was 3.45%–6.74% (see the Supporting Information). Three days later, the
changes in the removal rate of niclosamide in the three soils showed
the non-monotone change of “slow–gradual acceleration–gradual
deceleration”. The removal rate of niclosamide in carex, Artemisia
somai rhizosphere soil, and blank soil after culturing for 43 days
was 79.8%, 73.6%, and 67.9%, respectively.

Figure 1 Relationship between
niclosamide residual concentration and potted
time in rhizosphere soil.

According to Hamaker’s pesticide and other organic
compound
degradation dynamic model,17 the fitting
process of the niclosamide residual concentration in carex, Artemisia
somai rhizosphere soil, and blank soil after the potted plants was
carried out, and the results were shown in Figure 2. It could be seen from Figure 2 that the removal rate of niclosamide
in carex, Artemisia somai rhizosphere soil, and blank soil met the
kinetics characteristics of pseudo-first-order, and there was a good
linear relationship between the logarithm of residual concentration
(y) and degradation time (t) in
carex, Artemisia somai rhizosphere soil, and blank soil. The parameters
of the degradation kinetic equation were shown in Table 1. It could be seen that the
degradation rate constant of niclosamide in carex, Artemisia somai
rhizosphere soil, and blank soil was −0.0394, −0.0270,
and −0.0248, and the half-life of niclosamide in carex, Artemisia
somai, and blank rhizosphere soil was 14.6, 18.3, and 21.7 d, respectively.

Combined Table 1 and Figure 2, carex
rhizosphere exhibited a faster degradation of niclosamide than Artemisia
somai rhizosphere, and the degradation rate in plant rhizosphere was
faster than that in the blank control soil. Especially, the removal
rate of niclosamide in soil was quick in the first 3 days after the
plants were potted, which might be caused by the hydrolytic reaction
of niclosamide in moist soil in the initial phase. The results showed
that these two plants had a catalytic effect on the degradation of
niclosamide, and the effect of carex was greater than that of Artemisia
somai.

Transform Features of Niclosamide in the Rhizosphere Soil
Because intermediate products may be produced by the degradation
of niclosamide in the natural environment, HPLC chromatography was
used to qualitatively analyze the parent and possible degradation
products of niclosamide. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.3 μg·kg–1 and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.9 μg·kg–1 (see the Supporting Information).

The target products were qualitatively analyzed according
to peak retention time of the single standard sample, mixed standard
sample, and test sample in the same HPLC analysis conditions. HPLC
spectrograms of a single standard sample and mixed standard sample
were shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 indicated
that niclosamide and its natural degradation middle products such
as 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol,
aminoniclosamide, 5-chlorosalicylic acid, and niclosamide were well
separated in the set instrumental analysis conditions. In addition
to 5-chlorinated salicylic acid, other substances had good response
values when the light of the detection channel was 330 nm. 5-Chlorosalicylic
acid had good response value when the light of the detection channel
was 285 nm. The retention time of 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline,
2-chloro-4-nitrophenol, aminoniclosamide, 5-chlorosalicylic acid,
and niclosamide was 3.55, 6.70, 7.81, 10.21, 11.46, and 12.23 min,
respectively.

(f) mixed standard sample (5 mg·L–1, respectively).

In the soil of carex, Artemisia
somai rhizosphere, and blank control
group, niclosamide was converted into many intermediate products. Figure 4 was the HPLC spectrogram
of niclosamide degraded intermediate product in carex rhizosphere
soil which was the sixth day after potting. It can be seen from Figure 4 that part of niclosamide
was degraded into 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (3.48 min), 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline
(6.79 min), 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (7.89 min), aminoniclosamide (10.40
min), and 5-chloro salicylic acid (11.43 min); however, due to the
analysis conditions, there were also some compounds, the retention
times of which were 2.57, 4.33, 9.56, 15.38, and 15.77 min, that were
not qualitatively analyzed.

soil after carex pot culture for the sixth day.

The parent and possible intermediate product of niclosamide
natural
degradation were tested by HPLC–MS/MS, and the results were
shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 peaks A and B comprised
the total ion current (TIC) and indicated that there was a number
of intermediates generated during niclosamide natural degradation,
and more intermediates were found in plant rhizosphere soil than in
the blank control soil. The analysis results of TIC by MS/MS were
shown in Figure 5C.
Those results showed that there were several molecular ion peaks such
as 124.89, 141.86, 143.86, 152.89, 170.88, 172.94, 173, 297.15, 325.18,
etc. detected at 2.845, 3.390 , 3.430, 2.570, 7.037, 3.524, 5.769,
10.735, and 12.325 min in TIC, respectively. The possible molecular
formula and structural formula were deduced in Table 2. The results of Table 2 illustrated that some hydrolysate such as
5-chloro salicylic acid and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline were produced,
some reduction products such as aminoniclosamide and 2-chloro-p-phenylenediamine were produced, and some oxidative degradation
products such as 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid and hydroxyhdroquinone
were produced.

Combined HPLC and HPLC–MS/MS analysis results
indicated
that niclosamide would be degraded into a series of intermediate products
such as aminoniclosamide, 5-chloro-salicylic acid, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline,
2-chloro-4-nitrophenol, 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid, 2-chloro-p-phenylenediamine, hydroxyhdroquinone and 2-chlor-4-hydroxyphenol,
etc., in rhizosphere soil.

Effects of Microorganism
Populations on Niclosamide Degradation
in Rhizosphere Soil
Dynamic Change of Microbial Population in
Soil
The
population dynamic change of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes in
the rhizosphere soil of carex, Artemisia somai after potting, and
the control group soil were shown in Figure 6. The results of Figure 6 indicated that bacteria was the microorganisms
found the most in the rhizosphere soil of carex, Artemisia somai,
and the control group soil, followed by fungi and then actinomycetes,
which was consistent with the distribution of microorganisms in soil.
In the course of the entire cultivation, the amount of microorganisms
in the plant rhizosphere increased with the last cultivation time,
which was faster than that in control group, thus showing plant root
exudates could promote microbial growth. The population of bacteria
in the plant rhizosphere of carex and Artemisia somai reached a peak
at the 16th day of cultivation, and actinomycetes population reached
the highest point at the 25th day of cultivation, which is consistent
with the half-life of niclosamide degradation in the two kinds of
plant rhizosphere soil (Table 1).

Relationships between Niclosamide
Residues and Microbial Population
in Rhizosphere Soil
There was a good correspondence between
the niclosamide residues and the population of bacteria, fungi, and
actinomycetes in the plant rhizosphere soil. Results were shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 demonstrated that niclosamide
residues in carex and Artemisia somai soil were significantly negatively
correlated with the amount of three kinds of microbes (P < 0.05). Namely, in two kinds of plant rhizosphere soil, the
greater was the number of microorganisms, the less was the residues
of niclosamide. Figure 7 also showed that the microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and
actinomycetes played an important role in the degradation of niclosamide
in rhizosphere soil.

The Migration and Transformation
Characteristics of Niclosamide
in the Soil–Plant System
The Characteristics of
Niclosamide Residue in Plants
Niclosamide residue in plants
at different times were quantitatively
analyzed by using HPLC after plant potting; the results were shown
in Table 3. The analysis
results in Table 3 showed
that the maximum niclosamide residue in the aerial and root part of
Artemisia somai were 2.47 mg·kg–1 and 0.99
mg·kg–1 after cultivation for 10 and 2 days,
respectively. The maximum niclosamide residue in aerial and root part
of carex were 1.7 mg·kg–1 and 1.0 mg·kg–1 after cultivation for 6 days. Niclosamide mainly
existed in the aerial part of Artemisia somai, and the concentration
of niclosamide in the aerial part decreased rapidly after 10 days.
The trend of niclosamide in carex was the same as in Artemisia somai,
the differences were that the concentration decreased rapidly after
2 days. In the two plants, niclosamide residue concentration in the
aerial part was higher than that in the root part, and decreased rapidly
in the aerial part. The residue of niclosamide could not be detected
in carex aerial part after 16 days, which meant that the niclsoamide
degradation was nearly completed.

The Migration and Transformation
Characteristics of Niclosamide
within Plants
Niclosamide and its possible intermediate product
in a plant interior at different times were qualitatively and quantitatively
analyzed by using the retention time comparison method and quantitative
test by normal curve method of HPLC after the plant was potted. The
results were shown in Figure 8 and Table 3. It can be seen from Figure 8 that a variety of extractive products would be produced during
the preparation process of blank Artemisia somai analysis sample;
potted 6 days later, the ground part of Artemisia somai would produce
2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (3.48 min), 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (6.79
min), 2-chloro-4-nitro phenol (7.89 min), 5-chloro salicylic acid
(11.43 min) and niclosamide residues (12.27 min); However, due to
the analysis conditions, there were also some compounds whose retention
time was 4.02, 4.49, 7.52, 8.79, 13.43 and 14.72 min that were not
identified. The results of Table 3 indicated that the concentration of the intermediate
products which were qualitatively detected by niclosamide degraded
in plants appeared to change dynamically with time, and the concentration
decreased until it disappeared entirely.

Figure 8 HPLC spectra of niclosamide
residue and possible intermediate in
Artemisia somai: (A) blank, Artemisia somai overground part; (B) Cultured
for 6 days: Artemisia somai overground part.

The combined analysis results show that niclosamide would
be degraded
into a series of intermediate products such as aminoniclosamide, 5-chloro
salicylic acid, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, 2-chloro-4-nitro phenol,
2, 5-dihydroxy benzoic acid, 2-chloro-p-phenylenediamine, hydroxyhdroquinone
and 2-chlor-4-hydroxyphenol, etc.

The qualitative and quantitative
analysis results of niclosamide
and its possible intermediate product in the plant interior at different
times indicated that niclosamide migrated from soil into the stem
and leaf by plant roots, and transformed into a variety of intermediates
through physical and chemical reaction under the action of plant enzymes
in a potted plant–soil system. In this process, the hydrolysis
reaction of niclosamide occurred under the action of plants’
water, and produced 5-chloro salicylic acid and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline;
a redox reaction happened under the action of the plant enzymes and
produced aminoniclosamide, 2-chloro-p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-dihydroxy
benzoic acid, and hydroxyhdroquinone, etc.

The Migration and Transformation
Mechanism of Niclosamide in
Soil–Plant System
Comprehensive experimental results,
in the soil–plant system show that niclosamide could be degraded
in soil by physical, chemical, and biodegradation pathways under the
action of water, microorganisms, and plant root secretions in soil,
and produce 5-chlorosalicylic acid, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, aminoniclosamide,
2-chloro-p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic
acid, and hydroxyhdroquinone, etc (Table 3). Also, niclosamide migrated from soil into
the stem and leaf by plant roots.

Niclosamide and its possible
intermediate in the plant were degraded and produced 5-chloro salicylic
acid, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, aminoniclosamide, 2-chloro-p-phenylenediamine, 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid, etc., under
the action of water and enzymes in plants (Table 3). Finally, the intermediate was metabolized
into simple compounds such as CO2 and H2O. On
the basis of the results just mentioned, the migration and transformation
mechanism of niclosamide in the soil–plant system was proposed
and shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Possible migration and transformation mechanism of niclosamide
in the soil–plant system.

Risk Analysis of Edible Plants after the Use of Niclosamide
Author: The results of Table 2 indicated that niclosamide and it possible intermediate
products (such as 5-chlorinated salicylic acid, 2-chlorine-4-nitroaniline,
2-chloro-4- nitrophenol, aminoniclosamide) would remain in the plant
interior. According to previous studies, niclosamide was highly toxic
to fish and amphibians,18,19 5-chlorinated salicylic
acid had an effect on mutation and carcinogenesis,20 2-chlorine-4-nitroaniline could produce a lower level of
mutation than niclosamide,21 and 2-chlor-4-nitrophenol
belongs to the high toxic organic compound, and its acute oral toxicity
(LD50) to rats was 900 mg·kg–1. Thus, we can
conclude that there was a risk to edible plants when niclosamide was
used.

The results of Table 3 showed that the concentrations of niclosamide residue
and intermediate in plant material were changing with time, the maximum
niclosamide residue in the aerial and root part of Artemisia somai
was 2.47 mg·kg–1 and 0.99 mg·kg–1, respectively. In the aerial and root part of carex the maximum
niclosamide residue was 1.7 mg·kg–1 and 1.0
mg·kg–1. The maximum concentration of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol
in Artemisia somai was 0.065 mg·kg–1 and was
0.032 mg·kg–1 in carex which had a risk for
rabbit. As for 2-chloro-4-aminophenol, the concentration was much
higher than that of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol, the maximum concentration
was 0.741 mg·kg–1 in Artemisia somai and was
0.125 mg·kg–1 in carex.

At present, China,
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(UNFAO); America, and the European Union (UN) do not formulate the
maximum residue limit (MRL) of niclosamide in edible plant. According
to the MRL of niclosamide in rice formulated by China, which is 3.0
mg·kg–1,21 the maximum
residue of niclosamide in the edible plant Artemisia somai approached
the standard values, which constitutes some risks. Moreover, the concentration
of niclsoamdie residue in Artemisia somai was still high after 16
days, which demonstrated that niclosamide remained a long time in
Artemisia somai. Consequently, it was concluded that niclsaomdie could
pose a risk to edible plants.

Conclusion
In
this study, we had found that the degradation of niclosamide
in rhizosphere soil was in accordance with the first-order kinetic
equation. Carex and Artemisia selengensis rhizosphere could promote
the degradation of niclosamide in soil, and carex showed a greater
rate of degradation. In the plant–soil system, the presence
of a grater amount of microorganism resulted in less niclosamide residue,
which indicated that microorganisms had sn important contribution
to the degradation of niclosamide. Moreover, we analyzed the microbial
species in each rhizosphere soil and found that the main microorganism
in the carex rhizosphere was bacteria, was actinomycetes in Artemisia
selengensis rhizosphere, and was fungi in the control. This indicated
that a plant could adjust the physical and chemical properties of
the soil, and bacteria were more conductive niclosamide degradation.
In the soil and plant interior, niclosamide could degrade to a series
of aromatic products under the action of hydrolysis, microorganisms,
and plant enzymes, etc. The niclosamide residue and its degradation
products remain a long time in plants, which may pose a risk for the
edible plant.

Bonsai Preparation
Soil for experiment was air-dried
and passed through 3 mm sieves. The niclosamide methanol solution
was sprayed evenly to the soil and mixed well with the soil until
the methanol completely vaporized. The concentration of niclosamide
was 2.11 mg·kg–1 in the suspended soil. The
soil was subpacked evenly in 24 flowerpots (diameter, 15 cm; height,
20 cm). The collected plant (Artemisia somai and carex spp.) was divided into eight groups, respectively,
and the roots were washed with distilled water until soil-free. The
plants were then put in the experimental soil. Another eight flowerpots
were unplanted as control.

HPLC–MS/MS (Agilent 6538 Q-TOF System) equipped with an ESI
source. Samples were separated on a reversed-phase column (Kromasil
C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) with a guard column (5 μm, 10
mm × 4.6 mm i.d.). Analysis conditions for the HPLC: MeOH/0.1%,
methanoic acid = 70/30 was used as mobile phase and flow rate was
set to 0.2 mL·min–1 without a separation column.
Full scale MS spectra both in negative modes in the mass range between
50 and 800 m/z were recorded.

At the same time, niclosamide and its degradation intermediate products
in soil and plant samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed
by HPLC (2695, Waters, USA). Samples were separated on a reversed-phase
column (Kromasil C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) with a guard column
(5 μm, 10 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.). Mobile phase consisted of
0.2% formic acid methanol solution (A) and distilled water (B) by
using a gradient program of 50:50 (A:B, v/v) in 0–4 min, 60:40
in 4–10 min, 100:0 in 10–13 min, and 50:50 in 14–16
min. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and column temperature was 35 °C.
A photo-diode array (PDA) detector was set at 330 nm for acquiring
chromatograms, however, the PDA detector was set at 285 nm for acquiring
5-chlorinated salicylic acid chromatograms in the same chromatographic
condition.

Microorganisms including bacteria, antinomycetes,
and fungi, were
both measured by the dilution-plate method and grew respectively in
beef extract–peptone medium, antinomycetes culture medium,
and rose bengal medium. The amount of microorganisms was calculated
according to the following formula.

Clump count (CFU)/gram (dry
soil) = average colony number in Petri
dishes × dilution ratio/proportion of dry soil.

Calculations
and Model
The degradation rate of niclosamide
was calculated by fitting the data assuming first-order kinetics.
The rate constant and half-life of each sample were calculated according
to  where C is the concentration
of niclosamide at real time, C0 is the
initial concentration of niclosamide, k is the rate
of degradation of niclosamide, and t is the time.
