Aged garlic extract (AGE) is a popular
nutritional supplement and
is believed to promote health benefits by exhibiting antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory activities and hypolipidemic and antiplatelet effects.
We have previously identified N-α-(1-deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)-l-arginine (FruArg) as a major contributor
to the bioactivity of AGE in BV-2 microglial cells whereby it exerted
a significant ability to attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory
responses and to regulate the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response.
Here, we report on a sensitive ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) protocol that was validated
for the quantitation of FruArg in mouse plasma and brain tissue samples.
Solid-phase extraction was used to separate FruArg from proteins and
phospholipids present in the biological fluids. Results indicated
that
FruArg was readily absorbed into the blood circulation of mice after
intraperitoneal injections. FruArg was reliably detected in the subregions
of the brain tissue postinjection, indicating that it penetrates the
blood–brain barrier in subnanomolar concentrations that are
sufficient for its biological activity.

1 Introduction
The
medicinal properties of garlic (Allium sativum
L.) have long been recognized and, more recently,
subjected to a large number of studies. For example, garlic was shown
to protect the cardiovascular system by lowering total cholesterol
in serum, by reducing supine systolic blood pressure, and by modulating
platelet aggregation through upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) in blood.1−3 Dietary garlic may have cancer-preventive effects
as well.4,5 Thus, epidemiological studies in both Asian
and Western populations established that gastric and colon cancer
risks are inversely associated with garlic consumption.6,7 One of the popular garlic nutritional supplements is aged garlic
extract (AGE), an odorless product prepared by a prolonged (10–12
months) soaking of fresh garlic in 15–20% aqueous ethanol at
room temperature. Health-promoting properties of AGE have been documented
(for reviews see refs (8–10)), and the list
keeps expanding. For instance, AGE can act as a superoxide radical
scavenger,11−13 and it was shown to offer a potent antioxidant protection
to cells by stimulating the activity of cellular antioxidant enzymes
such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase
and by increasing intracellular glutathione.8,14 In
humans, AGE, when delivered as a dietary supplement, reduced total
serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and systolic pressure
in hypercholesterolemic patients.15

Although the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of whole
AGE and its sulfur-containing constituents are reasonably well-understood,
the nonsulfur nutraceuticals from AGE, such as fructose-amino acids
(FAs), have not been investigated thoroughly. FAs are found in processed
dairy products, dehydrated fruits, vegetables, and in medicinal preparations
such as extracts from Korean red ginseng or garlic.9,16 In
addition, FAs form in vivo, largely as a result of the interaction
between free glucose and N-terminal or lysine amino groups in proteins.
These modified (glycated) proteins, hemoglobin A1c ,
for example, have been used as a diagnostic marker for circulating
glucose levels in metabolic diseases such as diabetes, for over 3
decades.16−18 In spite of overwhelming evidence for constant exposure
to FAs, physiological roles or significance of these compounds in
humans is largely unknown. FAs are known to possess antioxidant properties,
by acting either as reducing agents (e.g., electrophiles) or as chelators
of redox-active metals such as copper and iron.19−24 Reports have also demonstrated the effects of FAs as immune stimulants
and the ability of FAs to prevent tumorigenesis and metastasis, owing
to their ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and adhesion.16,25,26

One of the most abundant
FAs found in AGE is N-α-(1-deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)-l-arginine (FruArg),
a typical Amadori rearrangement product arising from the condensation
reaction between free glucose and arginine during early stages of
the Maillard reaction, which is responsible for the specific color
and, to a large extent, the antioxidant properties of AGE.27,28 FruArg has been shown to exhibit antioxidant activity and hydrogen
peroxide scavenging capacity that is comparable to the potent hydrogen
peroxide scavenging compound ascorbic acid.29,30 In our previous study, both AGE and FruArg exhibited a capability
to modulate neuroinflammatory responses by suppressing nitric oxide
(NO) production, in a concentration-dependent manner, in lipopolysaccharide-induced
mouse BV-2 microglial cells without affecting the cell viability.31 This result has thus created a pretext for further
studies aiming to evaluate the potential of AGE and FruArg in targeting
neuroinflammation in vivo.

A major issue in the development
of drug therapy for neurological
diseases is the blood–brain barrier (BBB) because more than
98% of all small molecule drugs failed to pass through the BBB to
enter the brain.32 There are certain properties
a molecule must possess to be able to cross the BBB. Typically, these
include a molecular weight under 500 Da and having less than 10 atoms
that form hydrogen bonds.33 As the surface
area of the molecule increases, there is also a decreased likelihood
that it will be able to penetrate the tight junctions formed between
endothelial cells in the BBB. Several amino acids and sugars have
the ability to cross the BBB.34,35 The molecular weight
of FruArg is 336, and it has 11 heteroatoms theoretically capable
of participating in hydrogen bonding. However, the available
crystallographic data consistently demonstrated a propensity of 3–4
heteroatoms in FAs to form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, whereas
the furanose oxygen did not involve in any hydrogen bond formation.36 We therefore have hypothesized that the low
molecular weight and structural characteristics of FruArg may allow
it to cross the BBB and enter the brain.

To enable pharmacokinetic
(PK) and pharmacodynamic studies of FruArg
in vivo, a reliable method for its quantification at very low concentrations
is needed. A method utilizing ultraperformance liquid chromatography–electrospray
ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–ESI–MS/MS)
with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is described. Here, we report
the successful application of the validated UPLC–ESI–MS/MS
method to determine the amount of FruArg in mouse plasma and in brain
tissue.

2 Results and Discussion
MRM transitions
were identified at m/z = 337.1 →
70.1 and 337.1 → 114.1 Da and were used
for the quantification and qualification of FruArg, respectively (Figure S1, upper panel). An optimized collision
energy of 24 eV and an optimized cone voltage of 20 V were found.
An MRM transition was identified at m/z = 155.1 → 92.1 Da and was used for the quantification of l-lysine-d-3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6 (l-lysine-d8) (Figure S1, lower
panel). An optimized collision energy of 13 eV and an optimized cone
voltage of 24 V were found as well.

Successful separation was
achieved with a UPLC gradient using perfluoropentanoic
acid as an ion-pairing agent. FruArg eluted from the column at 5.9
min, and l-lysine-d8 eluted from
the column at 6.1 min (Figure 1). Excellent peak shapes and reproducible ion chromatographic
peak areas and retention times were observed throughout the study.
The performance of the analytical method was verified by performing
a method validation. This included tests for limit of quantitation
(LOQ), selectivity, linearity of the signal, range, recovery, matrix
effect, and interday and intraday precision. Values for these parameters
are listed in Table 1. LC-MS/MS has been used previously for the quantitation of amino
acids in plasma, including studies analyzing samples from children
with autism37 and development of a method
for high-throughput clinical trials.38

(top) and l-lysine-d8 (bottom)
were eluted from the column at 5.9 and 6.1
min, respectively. Their parent–daughter ion pairs were monitored
as 337.3 → 70.1 and 155.1→92.1 Da, respectively. The
peak areas of the MRM chromatograms were integrated and used for quantification.
All FruArg concentration calculations were relative to l-lysine-d8 I.S.

FruArg (40 mM) was administered
intraperitoneally (2.5 μL/g
body weight (BW)) to three mice. The plasma was extracted at 15, 30,
60, and 180 min and was analyzed for the FruArg concentration. The
concentration of FruArg in plasma as a function of time is shown in Figure 2. At 15 min, an average
FruArg concentration of 111 ± 3 μM was observed. The FruArg
concentration rapidly decreased to 33 ± 9 and 5 ± 2 μM
at 30 and 60 min, respectively. At 180 min, the concentration of FruArg
decreased below the LOQ. This illustrates that FruArg is rapidly absorbed
into the blood stream and then distributed to other parts of the body.

data points are represented as the average (n = 3)
FruArg concentration (μM) ± SE. The curve shown is the
results from the fit of the PK data from Table 2.

PK parameters were calculated to describe the concentration–time
relationship of FruArg in plasma, and the values are listed in Table 2. The initial concentration (C0) of FruArg 292 μM was measured by extrapolating the PK curve
to 0 min. The area under the curve (AUC) measures the systemic exposure
of FruArg. The (AUC0→last) was 4.86 × 103 μM·min, which measured the AUC from the initial
concentration to the last quantifiable time point. The (AUC0→∞) was
4.93 × 103 μM·min, which extrapolated the
AUC from the initial concentration to infinity. The elimination rate
(k) is the fraction of FruArg that is removed from
the body per unit time and was 6.91 × 10–2 min–1. The half-life (t1/2)
of FruArg was 10.03 min, clearance (Cl) was 1.8 × 10–4 L·min, and volume distribution (VD) was 2.63 × 10–3 L. The line shown in Figure 2 is the fit based on the PK parameters.

Brain tissue samples were collected
from the cerebellum and cortex
brain subregions at 15, 30, 60, and 180 min and at 15 min for the
striatum and hippocampus from mice (n = 3) injected
intraperitoneally (2.5 μL/g BW) with FruArg (40 mM). The concentration
of FruArg as a function of time in different types of brain tissue
is shown in Figure 3. FruArg was detected in all four subregions of the brain investigated,
with concentrations ranging from 4–7 pmol/mg tissue at 15 min,
showing nonspecific and time-dependent character of FruArg accumulation
in the brain (Table S1). Although the FruArg
concentration detected in the brain is low when compared with the
original injection concentration, similar results have been obtained
in previous BBB studies. Gooyit et al. detected SB-3CT, a selective
inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, present in similar
concentrations in the brain tissue (5.0 ± 0.8 pmol/mg at 10 min),
after the administration of comparable dosages to this study (25 mg/kg).39 The dose detected in the brain may not represent
the effective dose for FruArg, and further analysis of the dose range
is planned.

Several strategies exist
for drug delivery to the brain such as
transcranial, transnasal, BBB disruption, and lipidization of small
molecules. Most of these methods present major drawbacks, such as
having an invasive transcranial surgery for drug delivery. The workflow
of identifying molecules that can be distributed to the brain without
any type of assistance could help promote an alternative form of treatment
via long-term prevention. As treatments for neurological diseases
advance, it is critical to consider the BBB’s effect of drug
delivery. FruArg has exhibited excellent anti-inflammatory responses
and inhibited NO production in an in vitro model.31 Here, we have demonstrated that FruArg is rapidly absorbed
in blood, crossed the BBB, and reached all four subregions of the
brain. This is somewhat unexpected because a very limited number of
highly hydrophilic molecules have such an ability. Because passive
penetration of the BBB by FruArg is highly unlikely, this molecule
may use one of the active carbohydrate transporters, such as GLUT5.
Regardless of the mechanism, our data suggest further testing of FruArg
in therapeutic models aiming at prevention or treatment of neurological
diseases.

3 Experimental Section
N-α-(1-Deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)-l-arginine (FruArg)
was synthesized via a reflux reaction between l-arginine
and d-glucose.40 Identification
and purity of FruArg were confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR and using ESI mass spectrometry (Figure S2). A batch of purified FruArg, in the
form of hydroacetate salt, was sterile-filtered and kept frozen at
the stock concentration of 200 mM in double-distilled water. The stock
solution at 4 °C was stable for at least 6 months. Waters IntelliStart
software was used to identify transitions used for MRM scans. A 10
μM FruArg standard solution was directly infused in the mass
spectrometer at 20 μL/min. IntelliStart also finds the optimal
collision energy and cone voltage that produces the highest number
of ions. Two fragment ions of FruArg were identified; the more abundant
ion was used for quantification, and the less abundant ion was used
as a qualifier. l-Lysine-d8 was
used as an internal standard (I.S.) throughout the experiment. Identification
of l-lysine-d8 was verified using
ESI mass spectrometry (Figure S2). A stock
solution of 2000 ng/mL was prepared, and 25 μL of the stock
was spiked with 25 μL of plasma or 50 μL of brain tissue
initially before any sample preparation. IntelliStart was used to
identify transitions for MRM scans of l-lysine-d8 in the same manner as listed above. All quantitative
measurements of FruArg were normalized to the peak areas of l-lysine-d8 during the same LC-MS/MS run.

A Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with a quaternary solvent
manager was used in conjunction with a C18 column (Acquity BEH, 1.7
μm, 50 × 2.1 mm2, Waters, Milford, MA, USA).
A previously described 15 min UPLC method was used for FruArg separation.41 The mobile phases used were 5 mM perfluoropentanoic
acid solution in water (A) and 5 mM perfluoropentanoic acid solution
in acetonitrile (B). The gradient elution was 98% A at 0 min, 98%
A at 2 min, 50% A at 5 min, 50% A at 7 min, 98% A at 9 min, and 98%
A at 15 min. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min, and the injection volume
was 10 μL in a full-loop mode. The column was heated to 40 °C,
and the sample chamber was cooled to 10 °C.

A Waters Xevo
TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with ESI
in positive-ionization mode was used. The MRM scans were conducted
by selecting the parent and daughter ion m/z transitions of FruArg and l-lysine-d8, which were optimized using IntelliStart software. The
ion chromatographic peak areas of ion m/z transitions of 337.1 → 70.1 and 155.1 → 92.1 Da were
monitored for FruArg and l-lysine-d8, respectively, and the ratio of peak areas was used for quantification
(Figure 1). A desolvation
temperature of 350 °C and a source temperature of 150 °C
were used. A capillary voltage of 2.0 kV, cone voltage of 20 V, and
collision energy of 24 eV were used, and the nebulizer gas rate was
500 L N2/h. MassLynx software (version 4.1, Waters) was
used for all data acquisition.

Solid-phase extraction (SPE)
was facilitated using Phree phospholipid
removal solution 1 mL columns (Phenomenex). The columns were used
to separate FruArg from mice plasma and brain tissue samples. The
samples, 25 μL of plasma and 50 μL of brain tissue, were
spiked with 25 μL of l-lysine-d8, which was used as an I.S., and added directly on to the
Phree column. Methanol (500 μL; 1% formic acid) was added to
the column, and the samples were vortexed at the maximum velocity
for 2 min. Vacuum pressure (5–7 mmHg) was applied, and the
eluent was collected and dried under a steady stream of N2 gas and reconstituted in 500 μL of mobile phase A.

An
analytical method validation including analysis of selectivity,
sensitivity, linearity, range, recovery, matrix effect, interday and
intraday reproducibility was performed. Aliquots of blank plasma and
brain tissue from six different mice were prepared to test the selectivity
of the method. Blank plasma (25 μL) and 50 μL of blank
brain tissue supernatant were prepared as mentioned below and analyzed
to ensure that any potentially interfering endogenous compounds did
not affect the quantification of FruArg. The signal observed for all
samples was below the LOQ. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ)
was determined by performing serial dilutions on the FruArg stock
until the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRM chromatogram was approximately
10:1. Subsequent injections (n = 7) at this predicted
LOQ concentration were performed, and the coefficient of variance
(CV%) was determined and needed to be <20%. FruArg standards were
prepared at 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 μM and were
analyzed using the UPLC–MS/MS method discussed above to analyze
the linearity and range of the analytical method. The recovery of
the analytical method was analyzed for both biological matrices. Blank
mice plasma (25 μL; n = 4) was spiked with
25 μL of FruArg 100 μM and 25 μL of l-lysine-d8 (2 μg/mL) before SPE. Blank plasma (25
μL; n = 4) was spiked with equal amounts of
FruArg and l-lysine-d8 after
SPE. Recovery was assessed by comparing the ratio of peak areas of
FruArg/l-lysine-d8 of the samples
spiked before SPE to the ratio of peak areas of FruArg/l-lysine-d8 spiked after SPE. The recovery of FruArg in
the tissue samples was measured in the same way by spiking 50 μL
of blank tissue with 25 μL of FruArg and 25 μL of l-lysine-d8 before and after SPE.
The potential matrix effects of the plasma and brain tissue were analyzed
by comparing the signal of ratio of peak areas of FruArg/l-lysine-d8 spiked after SPE to the ratio
of peak areas of FruArg/l-lysine-d8 of neat standards prepared at the same concentration but diluted
from the initial FruArg stock solution in mobile phase A. Average
values used for recovery and matrix effect calculations are listed
in Table S2.

The precision and accuracy
of this method were analyzed by performing
analysis on three different batches of quality control (QC) samples
over the course of 3 different days. The precision was assessed by
the coefficient of variation (%) between samples (n = 3, intraday; n = 9, interday) using one-way ANOVA,
and the threshold of acceptance was <15%, except at the LLOQ, where
<20% is acceptable. The accuracy was assessed by calculating the
mean concentration obtained for each QC level (n =
3, intraday; n = 9, interday), and the threshold
of acceptance was within 15% of the calculated concentration, except
at the LLOQ, where within 20% of the calculated value was acceptable.
The initial FruArg stock (20 mM) was prepared in water. Serial dilutions
of the initial stock were performed to obtain 200, 150, 100, 50, 25,
10, and 5 μM FruArg working stock solutions for the calibration
curve. 25 μL of blank plasma was spiked with 25 μL of
each concentration of working stock solution and 25 μL of l-lysine-d8 (5 μg/mL) and
was prepared by the same way as mentioned above. A calibration curve
was generated using IntelliStart software, utilizing a 1/x2 weighting factor.

Adult male C57Bl/6J mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
at age 8 weeks were housed four per cage and maintained on a 12 h
light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM) with unrestricted access to
food and water ad libitum. Approved animal protocols were obtained
in accordance with the University of Missouri and the National Institutes
of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice
were injected intraperitoneally with 2.5 μL/g BW FruArg (40
mM). Terminal blood samples were collected at various time points
(15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 3 h) by cardiac puncture following CO2 asphyxiation, using heparin as an anticoagulant. The blood
was centrifuged to obtain plasma and frozen at −80 °C
until use. Whole brain samples were harvested and dissected into different
regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum) after transcardiac
perfusion with saline and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
and were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Brain samples
were weighed and homogenized for 5 min in 3 vol equiv of Milli-Q water
using a bullet blender (Next Advance, Inc., Averill Park, NY). The
homogenates were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min at 4
°C, and the supernatants were collected and analyzed.
