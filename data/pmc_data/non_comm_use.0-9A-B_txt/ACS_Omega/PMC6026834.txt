The
near-infrared fluorescent activatable smart probe Pyro-phosphatidylethanolamine
(PtdEtn)-QSY was synthesized and observed to selectively fluoresce
in the presence of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC).
PC-PLC is an important biological target as it is known to be upregulated
in a variety of cancers, including triple negative breast cancer.
Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY features a QSY21 quenching moiety instead of the Black
Hole Quencher-3 (BHQ-3) used previously because the latter contains
an azo bond, which could lead to biological instability.

Introduction
Advances in the field
of molecular imaging represent an ongoing
effort to improve the physician’s ability to detect, monitor,
and treat a variety of diseases, including cancer.1 Linder et al. describes these advances in terms of the
development of three classes of molecular imaging probes: nonspecific
agents, which fluoresce permanently, a specific or targeted probe
that contains a fluorophore, and an activatable smart probe with a
fluorophore that will only fluoresce upon enzymatic cleavage or activation
via another biological mechanism.2 In this
paper, we report the synthesis of an activatable smart probe designed
to detect enzyme activity in lipid metabolism with known cancerous
associations.

Lipids play an important role in biological systems
as they are
known to participate in the regulation of cell signaling.3 Because many cancers exhibit variations in their
metabolic and signaling profiles, enzymes in lipid metabolism have
become exciting targets for molecular imaging probes. Phosphocholine
(PC) is a lipid metabolite that has been observed in increased levels
in prostate,4−8 brain,4,6,9−12 and breast4,9,13−17 cancer cells and solid tumors. Elevated levels of PC have also been
associated with the degree of malignancy,18−20 and decreased
levels of PC are observed in response to chemotherapeutic treatment.21 PC has become an important and distinctive cancer
biomarker. To detect PC by an activatable smart probe it is necessary
to understand the surrounding biological processes. PC can be produced
by multiple metabolic pathways, including the anabolic phosphorylation
of choline by choline kinase or as the product of the catabolism of
phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase C (PLC), along with diacylglycerol.22−28 These metabolic processes are considered a potential factor in the
irregular choline metabolism observed in a variety of cancers.29−31 Elevated activity of phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (PC-PLC) has
been observed in a variety of cancer types, including the triple negative
breast cancer line, MDA-MB-231.32 On the
basis of these observations, our research efforts have centered on
the development of molecular imaging probes that will selectively
fluoresce in the presence of PC-PLC.

Previously, we reported
the synthesis and selectivity of an activatable
smart probe that selectively fluoresces in the presence of PC-PLC.22−24 This specific activation
is achieved by the precise construction of the probe based on a core
structure of the phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn).
If left unmodified, PtdEtn can be enzymatically cleaved by a variety
of enzymes. However, if a bulky moiety is placed at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone without a spacer, only cleavage
by PC-PLC is observed.22 Our lab exploited
this selective cleavage to design a next-generation activatable probe
selective for PC-PLC. The final goal would be to design a probe that
can more easily delineate cancerous tissue from healthy tissue.

Along with the selectivity achieved by the PtdEtn backbone, to
build the activatable probe, a precise fluorophore/quencher pair must
be implemented. The former has already been explored in our previous
research with the fluorophore, pyropheophorbide a (Pyro, λex = 410 and 665 nm; λem = 670–725
nm). Pyro achieves two goals: first, it is bulky enough to prevent
cleavage of the phospholipid by any enzyme other than PC-PLC (as described
above) and second, it fluoresces in the near-infrared (NIR) window.
NIR fluorophores have been of interest recently because the NIR window
is known for low autofluorescence, minimal absorption by water and
hemoglobin, and low tissue scattering. Notable examples are indocyanine
green or IRDye 800CW, both of which fluoresce in the NIR window and
can be observed by detectors with tissue depth penetration of up to
1 cm.2,33−36 The relative ease of detection
of a NIR fluorophore like Pyro makes it an ideal candidate. An additional
feature of Pyro is that it is a known photosensitizing agent, therefore
our probe could be used not only for detection of cancer but also
for treatment through the production of singlet oxygen when stimulated
at the proper wavelength.37−39

Despite the utility of
Pyro as a NIR fluorophore, to create an
activatable smart probe, the fluorescence must be quenched when not
in the presence of the activating enzyme, PC-PLC. This is achieved
by coupling a quenching moiety to the smart probe. Previously, our
laboratory used the NIR Black Hole Quencher-3 (BHQ-3, absorbance range
620–730 nm) because it precisely absorbed the fluorescence
emitted by Pyro through Förster resonance energy transfer.22 The completed probe Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ was successfully
isolated by our lab (Scheme 1) and tested against various sources of PC-PLC. In previously
published papers, we reported the biological testing of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ
against a series of phospholipases, including PC-PLC. Testing on cancer
cells was carried out with DU145 human prostate cancer cell line,
which has increased PC-PLC levels, and in vivo studies were performed
on mouse models bearing DU145 tumors.22−24 Despite the success
of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ, BHQ-3 has been shown to experience stability problems
in vivo due to the presence of an azo bond in the structure.2,40−44 Moreover, the shelf-life of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ chloroform solution
is less than 2 months, which makes it inconvenient for practical use
as it requires freshly synthesized probes. The synthesis is complicated,
and the overall yield of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ is as low as 15%.22

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ
Because of the quenching range afforded by BHQ-3,
it has been used
in a variety of fluorescent probes.2,44 Unfortunately,
as was just mentioned, one of the drawbacks noted for BHQ-3 is the
instability in the azo bond present in its structure.2,40−44 A 2015 article published by Uddin et al. exploits the ease of cleavage
of the azo bond of BHQ-3 as a probe activation mechanism to monitor
hypoxia in mouse models.44 Although this
example uses the azo bond for advantageous purposes, the bulk of the
literature on BHQ-3 describes a molecule with excellent quenching
potential but with the potential for structural instability.2,40−44 An alternative quenching moiety with similar quenching capabilities
but without an unstable azo bond could lead to a new generation of
more stable activatable probes.

In this paper, we present the
development of a new activatable
smart probe that incorporates an alternative, more stable quenching
moiety: QSY21, which has a similar quenching range (580–720
nm) to BHQ-3 (620–730 nm). Both quench in the NIR range, but
their difference lies in their structures as QSY21 does not contain
an azo bond (see structure in Scheme 2) and is therefore considered to be more stable. Moreover,
a variety of activatable smart probes have already been synthesized
using QSY21 to detect biological processes.42,45−58 This paper presents the synthesis and initial biological evaluation
of the novel PC-PLC selective probe, Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY.

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of Lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPtdEtn)-QSY
and Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
Results and Discussion
When the initial Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ
activatable probe was developed,
it required the use of a BOC-protected phosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPtdEtn-BOC,
see Scheme 1). By protecting
the primary amine of the phospholipid we were able to prevent the
coupling of the Pyro moiety at that position and saw exclusive substitution
at the desired sn-2 position, which is required to
achieve selective cleavage via PC-PLC.22

Although the use of the LysoPtdEtn-BOC was feasible, it would
have
been more economical to use the unprotected phospholipid LysoPtdEtn.
Unfortunately, when BHQ-3-SE was reacted with unprotected LysoPtdEtn,
the desired product, LysoPtdEtn-BHQ, could not be isolated.

However, when unprotected conditions were tested using the azo-free
quenching moiety, QSY21 (as succinimidyl ester, QSY21-SE), the desired
product, LysoPtdEtn-QSY, was isolated in decent yield as a blue oil
(Scheme 2). A detected
side product was the product of hydrolysis of QSY21-SE; this did not
inhibit the production or isolation of LysoPtdEtn-QSY. Not using a
BOC protecting group proved to be not only financially advantageous
but it also reduced the number of synthetic steps as we no longer
had to remove the protecting group. An additional disadvantage of
BOC-deprotecting step was partial chemical cleavage of ester bonds
at the glycerol backbone under the strong acidic conditions that dramatically
decreased the yield of Pyro-PtdEtn (20%, Scheme 1).22 That is why
this alteration most likely is responsible for the higher yield and
cleaner product obtained.

Once LysoPtdEtn-QSY was isolated,
Pyro is coupled to the sn-2 position of the phospholipid
using a carbodiimide, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethyl
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl). An excess of Pyro and EDC·HCl
is used to drive the reaction toward the desired product, Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
(Scheme 2). Initially,
Pyro appears green but once incorporated into the probe, its fluorescence
is quenched by QSY21 and the fully assembled probe, Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY,
appears aquamarine. This stark color change between Pyro and Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
simplifies the product isolation using column chromatography. The
overall yield of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY was as high as 61%, more than 4 times
higher than for Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ.22 The
shelf-life of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY chloroform solution by now is more than
8 months, which makes it an ideal probe for practical use.

With
Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY in hand, we set out to test its selective
activation by PC-PLC. To confirm its specificity, the probe was exposed
to PC-PLC as well as several other phospholipases, including sphingomyelinase
(SMase), sPLA2 (IB porcine), and phospholipase D (PLD). In this (and
next) experiment, the probe was incorporated into lipid nanoparticles
(LNP) in 140 mM NaCl–10 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid) (HEPES) buffer, pH 7.4, which we have previously found optimal
for LNP stability and in vitro experiments.59 It was excited at 409 nm, and emission was measured at 665 nm on
a plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices). When Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
was exposed to PC-PLC, an increase of fluorescence was observed, whereas
the other phospholipases did not yield any significant increase in
fluorescence (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Selective cleavage of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY by PC-PLC in a buffered solution
compared to several different phospholipases: PC-PLC, SMase, sPLA2 (IB porcine), PLD, and buffer 140 mM NaCl–10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4 (control). No positive control was used.

Because of the success of the initial enzyme tests, further
experiments
were conducted to see if the fluorescence of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY could
be restored when exposed to PC-PLC under conditions more closely related
to the intended translational use of the probe. Rather than excitation
and emission experiments conducted at a single wavelength in a plate
reader, we used an IVIS Spectrum imaging system with an excitation
filter range of 415–445 nm (430 nm filter) and detected the
emission in the 650–670 nm range (660 nm filter). For this,
Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY was exposed to a buffered solution (140 mM NaCl–10
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, control) and several phospholipase isoforms, as
described above. The results of this experiment are evident from Figure 2. Fluorescence is
observed almost immediately only when Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY is exposed to
PC-PLC. The fluorescence continues to increase with time, whereas
the buffered control, PLD, and sPLA2 (IB porcine) experiments
remain quenched even after 6 h. This experiment confirms the conclusions
of previous enzyme tests, demonstrating that Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY is successfully
quenched until it is exposed to PC-PLC and fluorescence is restored.
Moreover, this study is more accurate in confirming the potential
translational use of the probe as a detector for PC-PLC in in vitro
and in vivo models.

of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
by a buffered solution 140 mM NaCl–10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (control),
and several different phospholipase isoforms (sPLA2 (IB
porcine), PLD, and PC-PLC). No positive control was used.

Conclusions
The NIR fluorescent
probe Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY shows remarkable selectivity
for PC-PLC. The synthesis of the probe does not require the use of
protecting group chemistry essentially skipping a step that had been
previously required for a PC-PLC selective probe. Additionally, probe
stability is increased using a quenching moiety that does not have
an azo bond. This structural change could lead to increased stability
when exposed to biological conditions. Therefore, Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
is an excellent candidate for in vitro and in vivo studies of cancer
cell types with increased PC-PLC levels, such as MDA-MB-231, triple
negative breast cancer.25

Experimental
Procedures
Synthesis of LysoPtdEtn-QSY
LysoPtdEtn (0.050 g, 0.110
mmol) and QSY-SE (0.020 g, 0.0245 mmol) were added to a 100 mL round-bottom
flask with stir bar, followed by dry acetonitrile (∼50 mL),
diisopropylethylamine (40 μL, 0.230 mmol), and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine
(DMAP, 0.0087 g, 0.0712 mmol). The reaction flask was purged with
argon and covered in aluminum foil. The blue reaction solution was
stirred for 2 days. Reaction progress was tested via thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on functionalized silica diol (Sorbtech cat # 2933187) using
a methanol/chloroform solution (5:95). The product was observed at Rf = 0.47. The reaction solution was concentrated
in vacuo until ∼3 mL remained. The reaction solution was loaded
onto a silica diol (Sorbtech cat # 62570-01) column. A gradient of
methanol/chloroform eluent was used (0:100 to 20:80) to elute several
blue fractions. The blue fractions were tested via TLC, and on the
basis of these results, the proper fractions were concentrated to
a dark blue oil. The oil was left under vacuum overnight to reveal
the product (0.0239 g, 0.0214 mmol, 87% yield). The product, LysoPtdEtn-QSY,
was confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry and UV–vis spectrometry
(Supporting Information, SI).

Synthesis
of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY
LysoPtdEtn-QSY (0.0190
g, 0.0170 mmol) was put into a 20 dram vial charged with a stir bar,
followed by Pyro (0.0118 g, 0.0542 mmol), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl,
0.1848 g, 0.9640 mmol), DMAP (0.0225 g, 0.1841 mmol), and dry dichloromethane
(∼4 mL). The reaction vial was purged with argon, covered in
foil, and allowed to stir for 72 h. The reaction was monitored by
TLC on silica diol plates (5:95, methanol/chloroform) until an aquamarine
spot appeared at Rf = 0.6. The reaction
solution was loaded onto a silica diol (Sorbtech cat # 62570-01) column
(∼0.5 cm). Methanol/chloroform (1:99) was used to elute an
aquamarine band. The aquamarine band was concentrated to an oil and
placed under vacuum overnight to yield an aquamarine oil. The oil
was then picked up in minimal chloroform and placed on a silica diol
preparative TLC plate. The plate was eluted with 10:90 methanol/chloroform.
An aquamarine band was collected between Rf’s 0.70 and 0.75. The silica was collected and stirred with
10:90 methanol/chloroform. After filtering off the sorbent, the solution
was concentrated and underwent second preparative TLC to get rid of
fluorescent impurities (Pyro acid). The product was isolated as an
oil that was lyophilized overnight (0.0194 g, 0.0119 mmol, 70% yield).
The overall yield after two-step synthesis is 61%. The product was
confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry and UV–vis spectrometry
(SI).

Preparation of Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY-Loaded
Lipid Nanoparticles
DSPE-PEG2000 (1 mL of 5 mg/mL solution
in CHCl3, 1.78
μmol, 97% mol) and Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY in CHCl3 (55 nmol,
3% mol) were mixed in a 15 mL glass flask. (Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY concentration
in the initial chloroform solution was determined using the Beer–Lambert
law by measuring the optical density at 410 nm and employing an extinction
coefficient of 110 000 M/cm.) The solvent was evaporated under
nitrogen flow. The obtained lipid film was dried under high vacuum
overnight. The flask was then flushed with Ar and held in the water
bath at 80 °C for 3 min, then rehydrated with 1 mL of hot (80
°C) degassed buffer solution under Ar flow. Buffer (140 mM NaCl–10
mM HEPES) was used at pH 7.4. The mixture was vortexed until an optically
clear dispersion was obtained and allowed to cool down. Upon reaching
room temperature, the solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm
MILLEX-GV filter.

Enzyme-Mediated Probe Cleavage
Fluorescence
experiments:
90 μL of phospholipase solution in buffer (140 mM NaCl–10
mM HEPES, pH = 7.4) was placed into a black wall flat clear bottom
96-well plate (10 units per well). Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY lipid dispersion
(10 μL) in buffer (140 mM NaCl–10 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4)
was added to the phospholipase to a final concentration of 1 mM. Fluorescence
was monitored over time at 37 °C on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax
M5 plate reader under excitation 409 nm and emission 665 nm.

Enzyme-Mediated
Probe Cleavage: IVIS Spectrum Experiments
The IVIS Spectrum
(PerkinElmer, Hopkinton, MA) is an advanced preclinical
optical imaging system ideal for fluorescence imaging in vivo and
in vitro. Black wall clear bottom 96-well plates were prepared as
above with solutions of 1 mM Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY and 10 units of phospholipases
in 140 mM NaCl–10 mM HEPES buffer, pH = 7.4. Fluorescence was
monitored over time at 37 °C with excitation between 415 and
445 nm (430 nm filter) and emission at 650–670 nm (660 nm filter).
