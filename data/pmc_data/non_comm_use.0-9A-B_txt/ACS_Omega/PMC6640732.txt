The
remediation of metal and heavy metal contaminants from water
ecosystems is a long-standing problem in the field of water management.
The development of efficient, cost effective, and environmentally
friendly natural polymer-based adsorbents is reported here. Magnetic
chitosan (CS) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMC) nanocomposites have
been synthesized by a simple one-step chemical coprecipitation method.
The nanoparticles were assessed for the removal of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions from aqueous solution.
Kinetic and thermodynamic models were used to describe and understand
the adsorption process of the ions onto the nanomaterials. The interactions
between the ions and the biopolymer-based composites are reversible,
which means that the nanoparticles can be regenerated in weakly acidic
or EDTA containing solution without losing their activity and stability
for water cleanup applications.

Introduction
The waste products of manufacturing processes
of over three centuries
of industrialization have had unintentional consequences, of which
the long-term issues of environmental pollution, in both terrestrial
and water systems, are widely reported. One major issue is the contamination
of water ecosystems by toxic heavy metal ions; this has been a concern
for many decades. The ability of metal ions to accumulate in the tissue
of plants, fish, and mammals poses a serious threat to human health.
This is both through bioaccumulation in the food chain and also because
of their ability to bind to proteins and metabolites in living organisms.1−4 Several techniques are available for heavy metal ion removal from
water; typical technologies include ion-exchange, chemical precipitation,
membrane filtration, electrochemical methods, and adsorption, to name
only a few.5 Among these, the use of biopolymers
as adsorbents is especially attractive because of their low operational
cost and high efficiency. This has contributed to the development
of novel adsorbents in recent decades.6,7 The use of
biopolymer-based adsorbents, such as polysaccharides, offers biocompatibility
and biodegradability advantages. This has led to their wider application
in the water treatment industry.8 Chitosan
(CS) is a type of polyaminosaccharide synthesized from the deacetylation
of chitin, a polysaccharide consisting predominantly of unbranched
chains of β-(1 → 4)-2-acetoamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose.
Chitin is the second most abundant polymer in nature after cellulose.9 The amino and hydroxyl functional groups of CS
are effective binding sites for metal ions. Carboxymethylchitosan
(CMC) is reported to have a higher metal ion binding capacity than
CS because of the increased chain flexibility and higher concentration
of chelating groups.10−13 Compared with conventional adsorbents, magnetic adsorbents offer
the attractive benefit of allowing their straightforward separation
and removal from water, with the use of an external magnetic field.
In the current study, CS and CMC magnetite nanoparticles were prepared
by a simple, one-step chemical coprecipitation method. The resulting
nanocomposites were used as a tool for the rapid removal of heavy
metal ions, such as copper (Cu(II)), lead (Pb(II)), and zinc (Zn(II)).
The relationship between the adsorption capacity and the adsorption
mechanisms was studied, and equilibrium data were analyzed using Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherms.

Experimental Section
Materials
CS (low
molecular weight), iron(III) chloride
hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), ethylene glycol
(EG), and ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich. CMC was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Pure water (18 MΩ cm) was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore,
Milford, MA, USA). Other chemicals were of analytical grade and were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

Synthesis of CS and CMC
Magnetic Nanoparticles
Colloidal
nanoparticles were synthesized via a versatile solvothermal reaction
reported by Fang et al.14 with a modification.
Briefly, 2.5 g of FeCl3·6H2O, 4 g of NH4Ac, and 1.2 g of CS or CMC were dissolved in EG (75 mL) aided
by sonication for 30 min to form a clear solution. The solution was
then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclaved (100 mL) and heated
at 200 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the solution was cooled
to room temperature and isolated with a magnet. The nanoparticles
were thoroughly washed with distilled water and ethanol and then also
stored in ethanol.

Adsorption Kinetic Studies
Aqueous
solutions of heavy
metal ions were prepared by dissolving PbCl2, CuCl2, and ZnCl2 in distilled water to reach a final
cation concentration of 100 mg·L–1. Sorption
studies were then conducted by mixing 20 mg of CS and CMC magnetic
nanoparticles into 20 mL of aqueous solutions of the desired heavy
metal ion. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 5.2 ±
0.5 below the pKa of CS (∼6.2).
This ensures that the
amine groups are protonated and the adsorption of metal ions onto
(carboxymethyl) chitosan is optimal.15 The
resulting dispersions were shaken mechanically at 200 rpm at room
temperature, and the effect of contact time was evaluated between
2 and 60 min. After 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, 1 mL of solution was
collected and the nanoparticles were removed by magnetic separation.
The ion concentration was
then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-OES). The adsorption capacities of CS and CMC magnetic nanoparticles q (mg/g) were calculated by eq 1 1  where C0 and Ct denote the initial and final concentration
of heavy metal ions in solution (mg·L–1), respectively. V denotes the volume of aqueous solution (L), and w is the mass of CS and CMC magnetic adsorbents (mg).

Adsorption Isotherm Studies
Adsorption isotherm studies
describe the relationship between adsorbents and adsorbates at equilibrium.16 Adsorption isotherms of Cu(II), Pb(II), and
Zn(II) on CS and CMC magnetic nanoparticles were obtained by dispersing
0.1 g of magnetic adsorbent into 100 mL of heavy metal ion solution,
with concentrations ranging from 100 to 700 mg·L–1. Adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted at pH 5.2 ±
0.5. Dispersions were shaken mechanically at 200 rpm at room temperature,
and 1 mL of solution was withdrawn after 24 h. The colloidal nanoparticles
were removed by magnetic separation, and the ion concentration was
then established using ICP-OES analysis.

Regeneration Studies
For desorption experiments, 20
mg of CS and CMC nanoparticles previously loaded with Cu(II), Pb(II),
and Zn(II) were collected and gently washed with distilled water to
remove any unabsorbed metal ion, and then, 20 mL of EDTA solution
(0.01 mol·L–1) was added. The samples were
then shaken mechanically at 200 rpm at room temperature for 24 h for
desorption to occur. Finally, colloidal nanoparticles were removed
by magnetic separation, and the ion concentration was again analyzed
using ICP-OES.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of CS
and CMC Magnetic Nanoparticles
The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the CMC magnetic
colloidal particles are given in Figure 1. The particles exhibit a uniform size of
approximately 500 nm. Interestingly, the high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the CMC magnetic particles (Figure 2) show fringes at
the edges of the particles. The appearance of the colloidal particles
is consistent with that of an agglomeration of smaller Fe3O4 precursors.

(b) resolution.

Figure 2 (a–c) HRTEM micrographs
of CMC magnetic nanoparticles.

The structures of CS and CMC magnetite nanoparticles were
characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 3a). Six peaks that are characteristic of Fe3O4, namely, (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440)
were observed for all samples (JCPDS no. 75-1610). To confirm the
presence of CS and CMC, FT-IR spectra of nanoparticle composites were
examined and are shown in Figure 3b. The CS spectrum shows a strong peak at 3231 cm–1, which is assigned to the N–H extension vibration
and O–H stretching vibration, as well as belonging to intermolecular
hydrogen bonding, within the biopolymer. The signals at 2977 and 2882
cm–1 were assigned to the vibration of methyl and
methylene C–H bonds, respectively. The peaks in 1089 and 1046
cm–1 corresponded to the bridge-O-stretch and C–O
stretch, respectively.17,18 The difference between CS and
CMC spectra was the peaks obtained solely in the spectra of CMC at
1631 and 1396 cm–1; this IR region is specific for
the COO– carboxylate group, and the peaks were attributed
to the carboxylate C=O asymmetric stretching and the C=O
symmetric stretching.19

and CMC magnetite composite nanoparticles
and (b) IR spectra of CS and CMC composite nanoparticles.

Figure 4 shows the
magnetization of CS and CMC magnetite nanoparticles as a function
of the magnetic field at 300 K. The measurements were obtained with
a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) with an applied magnetic field
ranging from −10 to 10 kOe. The absence of any significant
remanence or coercivity in the magnetization curves suggests that
the samples can be classified as paramagnetic. Moreover, the magnetic
saturation of CS and CMC magnetite nanoparticles is 13 and 15 emu/g,
respectively. Such magnetic properties mean that the nanoparticles
are susceptible to an external magnetic field and can easily be separated
from solution.

Kinetic Adsorption Study
of Metal Ions on CS and CMC Nanocomposites
The adsorption
performance of CS and CMC magnetic nanoparticles
with metal ions was investigated by a batch equilibrium technique
for contact times varying between 2 and 60 min. The results for Cu,
Pb, and Zn ions are shown in Figure 5. The spontaneously high rate of metal ion uptake at
short contact times was associated with the significant number of
active sites available on the nanoparticles. However, as the contact
times increase, metal ions progressively bind to these sites. The
rate of sorption then slows down before reaching equilibrium after
60 min, as illustrated by the plateau on the curves in Figure 5. The adsorption capacity (qe) of CS nanoparticles was in the following
order: Pb(II) 88.5 mg·g–1 > Cu(II) 79.3
mg·g–1 > Zn(II) 61 mg·g–1. The performance
of CMC nanocomposites was higher, with the following maximum ion uptakes:
Pb(II) 107.5 mg·g–1 > Cu(II) 99 mg·g–1 > Zn(II) 75.8 mg·g–1. The
increased sorption capacity of CMC was attributed to the availability
of a large number of −COO– groups, which
are able to coordinate to metal ions. To further investigate the adsorption
mechanism and determine the sorption efficiency of the nanocomposites,
the kinetic process was studied by fitting the experimental data to
the kinetic models, presented in Table 1. According to the R-squared values
of the regression analyses presented in Table 2, the pseudo-second-order model offers the
best mathematical fit to describe the adsorption kinetics of Pb(II),
Cu(II), and Zn(II) onto CS and CMC nanoparticles. Such kinetic models
imply that chemisorption is likely to be the rate-limiting step of
the adsorption process.20,21

Isotherm
Adsorption Study
Figure 6 shows the adsorption equilibrium isotherm
data obtained for Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) ions adsorbed onto CS
and CMC nanocomposites. These adsorption isotherms allow for the amount
of metal ions adsorbed (per unit weight of nanocomposites) to be correlated
to the remaining concentration of metal ions in the aqueous phase
at a given temperature under equilibria conditions. This type of data
set is highly valuable to aid the understanding of the mechanism of
adsorption, as well as to interpret the kinetics of the adsorption
process. Figure 6 shows
that the uptake capacity of the nanocomposites was found to increase
with the equilibrium concentrations of the metal ions in solution,
progressively reaching saturation of the adsorbent. The experimental
data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich models; these equations
are shown in Table 3 and are commonly used for analyzing the nature of adsorbate–adsorbent
interactions.23,24

a qe and Ce denotes the amount adsorbed (mg·g–1) and adsorbate concentration in solution (mg·L–1) at equilibrium, respectively. KL is
the Langmuir constant (L·mg–1), and qm denotes the maximum adsorption
capacity of the monolayer formed on the adsorbent.

b Kf and n denote the Freundlich isotherm constants, indicating the
adsorption capacity (mg·g–1) and adsorption

According to the R-squared values
of the regression
analyses presented in Table 4, both Langmuir and Freundlich models fitted the experimental
isotherm equilibrium data reasonably well, with R2 values >0.927. According to these values, the Langmuir
equation provided the best fit for the experimental data of the CS
magnetic nanoparticles (for the three metal ions tested) in the entire
range of concentrations studied. The Langmuir model assumes that the
adsorbent surface has a finite number of binding sites of identical
energy and that each adsorbate ion is located at a single site. The
model suggests the formation of a monolayer of metal ions on the surface
of CS nanoparticles. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of CS nanocomposites was Pb(II) 141 mg·g–1 > Cu(II) 123 mg·g–1 > Zn(II) 88 mg·g–1. For the CMC nanocomposites, the maximum adsorption
capacity was significantly higher for the three metal ions in the
order Pb(II) 243 mg·g–1 > Cu(II) 232 mg·g–1 > Zn(II) 131 mg·g–1. The
Freundlich
model was found to be more accurate when describing the adsorption
of metal ions on CMC nanocomposites. Freundlich isotherms represent
an empirical model employed to describe the equilibrium on a heterogeneous
surface; they do not assume a monolayer capacity as in the case of
the Langmuir model.26 Freundlich isotherms
suggest the presence of different binding sites on the adsorbent,
which is in agreement with the chemical structure of CMC. Both carboxylate
−COO– and amino −NH2 groups
can participate in the metal-ion binding process. The value of 1/n (Freundlich model) can be used to predict the binding
affinity between the sorbent and the sorbate27 with small values, implying stronger interactions between sorbents
and metal ions. From Table 4, the values of n for Pb(II) are larger than
those for Cu(II) and Zn(II), suggesting stronger binding interactions
between Pb(II) and the active sites of CMC nanocomposites.

The adsorption capacity
of the synthesized CS and CMC magnetic
nanoparticles toward heavy metal ions is compared with those reported,
as shown in Table 5. The maximum capacity of CMC magnetic nanoparticles is certainly
comparable and possibly even higher than that of other CS-based adsorbents
for the three metal ions tested. This is with the exceptions of CS
hydroxyapatite nanocomposite beads and CS-coated mesoporous calcium
silicate hydrate microspheres because of the high specific surface
area of the microspheres.

Regeneration Studies
Desorption experiments are of
paramount importance for the recovery of the metal ions to help understand
the adsorption process of the adsorbates. In the current study, the
nanoparticles were regenerated by stripping the sorbed metal ions
using EDTA chelation; such a procedure has previously been found to
desorb metal ions from CS in a superior manner to using a solution
of HCl.33−35Figure 7 shows the regeneration of the nanocomposites over three successive
cycles of adsorption and desorption. The results show that the magnetic
nanocomposites release the adsorbed metal ions with regeneration efficiency
above 60% based on the adsorption capacity in each cycle. Despite
the overall adsorption capacity reducing slightly after each cycle,
the adsorption capacity of the magnetic nanoparticles remains high,
which suggests a limited number of irreversible sites on the surfaces
of the synthesized nanocomposites that are not recovered when using
the EDTA desorption solution. Interestingly, the capacity loss observed
was larger for nanoparticles loaded with Pb(II) and Cu(II) than that
for nanoparticles loaded with Zn(II). It is likely that the higher
binding affinity between the sorbent and Pb(II) and Cu(II) highlighted
in the isotherm adsorption studies somewhat limits the stripping effect
of the EDTA solution, which tends to moderately reduce their loading
ability after successive regeneration cycles.

Conclusion
CS and CMC magnetic nanocomposites
were synthesized using a simple
one-step chemical coprecipitation method. The nanoparticles provide
an efficient, fast, and environmentally friendly approach for the
removal of the metal ions Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) from aqueous
solutions. The current work shows that the binding capacity of the
nanoparticles to metal ions is comparable or even higher than that
of other CS-based adsorbents. In addition to the amine groups, the
presence of a carboxylic moiety on CMC nanoparticles is likely to
offer additional binding sites, which considerably enhance their loading
capacity in comparison to the CS nanoparticles. This mechanism is
in agreement with the good fitting of the experimental data with the
Freundlich adsorption isotherm. Moreover, the magnetic properties
of the nanoparticles when coupled to their regenerative performances
make them a potential, efficient, and cost-effective tool for heavy
metal ion removal for water treatment industries.
