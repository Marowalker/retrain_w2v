Biodegradation of ferulic acid, by an endophytic fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides TMTM-13 associated
with Ostrya rehderiana Chun, was explored
in this study. Ferulic acid was completely degraded by TMTM-13 as
its initial concentration was lower than 400 mg L–1. Generally, the initial concentration of ferulic acid and fungal
biomass of TMTM-13 kept synchronously growing up as the concentration
was lower than 400 mg L–1. Fungal biomass reached
a maximum of almost 1.177 g L–1 under concentrations
of 400–450 mg L–1. HPLC-MS analysis indicated
that ferulic acid ultimately degraded to vanillin, vanillic acid,
acetovanillone, and dihydroconiferyl alcohol by TMTM-13. This study
was the first report about an endophytic fungus associated with O. rehderiana Chun that has great potential for practical
application in ferulic acid contaminated environments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ferulic acid is one of
the important allelochemicals inducing continuous cropping obstacles
in crops.1 It can result in generalized
cellular disruption, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration and
photosynthesis, damages the membrane structure of cells, and produces
autotoxicity in crops.2,3 Meanwhile, with the development
of industry, ferulic acid is now presented in high concentrations
in many industrial effluents and residues, including those produced
in wine distilleries, olive oil processing industries, and pulp paper
processing.4 Ferulic acid is considered
an environmental pollutant because it is highly toxic to organisms
and difficult to degrade in natural conditions.5 Now, research on the degradation of ferulic acid has become
one of the key problems in the field of industrial and agricultural
environments.

Several methods have been studied over the long
term for promoting the degradation of ferulic acid, including photocatalytic
degradation and chemical oxidation.6,7 The use of
photocatalysis has proven to be a feasible method, while it has the
main limitations of low stability and the difficulty in reusing.8 Similarly, chemical oxidation, such as advanced
oxidation, has demonstrated its potential in degrading ferulic acid
effectively. However, the high cost and almost no prospect in economy
stop its practical application in ferulic acid contaminated soil environments.9 As an alternative, fungal bioremediation is an
environmentally friendly approach to remove ferulic acid. As a large
and novel microbial resource, endophytic fungi, which have a broad
application prospect in degradation of organic acid pollutants, are
now used in the field of bioremediation. For example, endophytic Phomopsis sp. could degrade ferulic acid and sinapic acid.5,10Ostrya rehderiana Chun, an endangered
species,11 has its uniqueness in both phylogeny
and biogeography, which only lives in West Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang.
Upon our preliminary screening, an endophytic fungus TMTM-13 isolated
from O. rehderiana exhibited potent
biodegradation activities to ferulic acid. The objectives of the present
studies were to identify tolerance concentration of TMTM-13 for degradation
and detect the metabolic mechanism, which provide a basis for the
widespread application of endophytic fungi in the pollutions caused
by ferulic acid.

2 Methods
2.1 Experimental Materials
Leafy branches
of O. rehderiana Chun were collected
from West Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang Province.

2.2 Isolation and Identification of Strain TMTM-13
The fresh leaves of O. rehderiana Chun were washed in running water to remove unrelated adsorbates.
After being sterilized in 75% ethanol for 1 min, the leaves were immersed
in 3% NaClO for 1 min and washed with distilled water five times,
each for 5 s. Then they were dried on the sterile filter paper. The
sterilized tissues were cut into pieces and put in the PDA medium
(potato 200 g L–1, glucose 20 g L–1, agar 15–20 g L–1, distilled water 1000
mL, pH 7.0.). After incubating at 28 °C for 3–4 days,
the fungus was further purified and transferred to the slope. The
fungal strain was preliminarily differentiated by the morphological
characteristics. The molecular identification of target strains was
performed by the ITS rDNA sequence.

2.3 Identification of the Tolerance Concentration
of TMTM-13 for Degradation
The endophytic fungus was inoculated
in 50 mL of PDB medium, activated at 28 °C in a shaker rotating
at 180 rpm for 48 h. Fungal mycelium was collected, washed twice with
distilled water, and then diluted with 100 mL of MSM liquid medium
(NaNO3 2 g L–1, K2HPO4 1 g L–1, KCl 0.5 g L–1, MgSO4 0.5 g L–1, FeSO4 0.01
g L–1, agar 15–20 g L–1, distilled water 1000 mL, pH 7.0.) consisting of glass beads. The
cultures were incubated at 28 °C in a shaker rotating at
180 rpm for 2 h to eliminate the available nutrients adhered on the
mycelium surface and make the mycelia as disperse as possible.

Fungal mycelia of 2 mL inoculums were added to the MSM medium with
the sole carbon source, ferulic acid, from 50 to 600 mg L–1. The cultures were incubated at 28 °C with shading treatments
in a shaker rotating at 180 rpm for 72 h. The dry weight of fungal
mycelium contained in 2 mL of MSM medium was weighed three times,
and the average was taken. The fermented broth and fungal mycelia
were collected by filtering to detect the remaining ferulic acid concentration
and dried fungal biomass, respectively.5

The decrement of ferulic acid was gauged by HPLC (the HPLC
conditions:5 Agilent LC chemstation and
Diamonsil C18 chromatographic column; mobile phase:carbinol(A)-0.01
M KH2PO4 solution (pH 3.7) (B); gradient elution:
0–15 min 30% → 85% A, 15–18 min 85% A; detection
wavelength: 323 nm; flow rate: 0.8 mL/min; column temperature: 28
°C; sampling amount: 10 μL).

2.4 Identifying the Metabolic Products
The fungal mycelia were added to 2 L of MSM medium with the optimum
concentration of ferulic acid as the sole carbon source. They were
incubated at 28 °C with shading treatments in a shaker rotating
at 180 rpm for 72 h. Then the fermentation broth was collected, and
the metabolites were enriched with ethyl acetate using a rotary evaporator
and gauged by the HPLC-MS technique.5

2.5 Statistical Analysis
Basic statistics
was processed by SPSS, and diagrams were drawn with GraphPad Prism
5.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Isolation and Identification of Strain TMTM-13
Morphological characteristics of TMTM-13 were observed in the MSM
medium. The colony of strain TMTM-13 became circle-like with a diameter
of 28 mm, and its hypha was similar to fluff in high density. The
middle of the colony was protruding slightly with a gray color, while
the edge was flat with a gray white color. The transparent hypha had
no septum under the light microscope. Moreover, hyaline conidia were
produced in cylindrical shape with rounded ends. The morphological
characteristics were similar to those of Colletotrichum isolates.12

The ITS rDNA region
of strain TMTM-13 was sequenced, and the identification was performed
by comparison with published sequences in GenBank using BLAST. 20
strains of fungi were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, which
indicated that the TMTM-13 was closely related to C.
gloeosporioidesJF710562 (Figure 1). Therefore, TMTM-13 was identified as C. gloeosporioides according to morphological characteristics
and ITS rDNA sequences analysis.

on the 5.8S rDNA region sequence.

3.2 Effect of Ferulic Acid Concentration on Degradation
The concentration of remaining ferulic acid and fungal biomass
were examined after 48 h incubation (Figure 2). When the initial concentration of ferulic
acid was 350 mg L–1 or lower, there was almost no
ferulic acid left in solution. If the initial concentration went up
to 400–450 mg L–1, the remaining ferulic
acid was 0.05–0.15 times the concentration of the ferulic acid
at the beginning. However, the degradation ability of TMTM-13 showed
an apparent decline as the initial concentrations were more than 450
mg L–1. Generally, the initial concentration of
ferulic acid and fungal biomass of TMTM-13 kept synchronously growing
up as the initial concentration was lower than 400 mg L–1. Furthermore, fungal biomass reached a maximum of almost 1.177 g
L–1 under concentrations of 400–450 mg L–1. Nevertheless, fungal biomass presented a decreasing
trend as the concentrations were more than 450 mg L–1, opposite to lower than 400 mg L–1. To our knowledge,
this study was the first report about an endophytic fungus associated
with O. rehderiana Chun that has great
potential in the biodegradation of ferulic acid.

Figure 2 Determination of optimum
concentration for degradation and fungal biomass.

TMTM-13 performed well in the degradation of ferulic
acid in comparison with Phomopsis liquidambaris,5 an endophytic fungus isolated from Bischofia polycarpa. TMTM-13 showed stronger capability
of tolerance with its optimum concentrations of 400–450 mg
L–1, while the latter reached a maximum of degradation
effect when the concentration was 200 mg L–1. Nevertheless,
the decrement of ferulic acid and the increment of fungal biomass
in TMTM-13’s experiment were a little bit lower than those
in P. liquidambaris when both were
put in the same conditions, which indicated that TMTM-13 was slightly
inferior to P. liquidambaris in degradation
efficiency.

Based on the results above, when the initial concentration
of ferulic acid was under 400 mg L–1, almost no
negative impact was put on TMTM-13, while higher ferulic acid concentrations
could be poisonous. The finding was highly consistent with that of
Mendonça et al.,13 whose study suggested
that high concentrations of xenobiotic substances were related with
abnormal microbial growth. As a kind of microorganism coevolving with
plants for a long time, endophytic bacteria associated with plants
may be capable of eliminating environmental pollutants due to the
unique living environments and metabolic pathways.14 Tian et al. found an endophytic strain B4 from Artemisia annua L., which presented its superior
performances in absorbing, degrading, and eliminating toxicity in
triclosan (TCS) bioremediation.15Ceratobasidium stevensii B6 isolated from B. polycarpa showed high efficiency in degrading
phenanthrene.16 In addition to organic
compounds mentioned above, Cycon et al. demonstrated that diazinon-degrading Serratia marcescens had bioremediation potential
to remove the organophosphorus pesticides from soils.17 Moreover, various microorganisms have been found and studied,
which were useful in degrading environmental pollutants.18,19

3.3 Identification of Metabolic Products
All compounds in the solution were analyzed by the HPLC-MS technique
to detect relative molecular masses. According to Figure 3, four major biodegradation
products were observed separately, and HPLC-MS analysis further showed
that the metabolic products were vanillin, acetovanillone, vanillic
acid, and dihydroconiferyl alcohol with [M–H]−m/z 151, 165, 167, and 181, respectively.
Also, ferulic acid was found with a relatively high concentration.
Based on the possible pathway of ferulic acid degradation in microorganisms,20,21 the proposed metabolic pathway in TMTM-13 degradation is displayed
in Figure 4. However,
the intermediate products 4-vinylguaiacol and coniferyl alcohol could
not be examined by HPLC-MS. This might be attributed to their low
concentrations, which were hard to be detected by equipment.

4 Conclusions
The endophytic fungus C. gloeosporioides TMTM-13 could grow and multiply
using ferulic acid as the sole carbon source. The fungus degraded
ferulic acid effectively in the MSM liquid medium. The biodegradation
pathway of ferulic acid by TMTM-13 was also preliminarily proposed.
This was the first to find that an endophytic fungus associated with O. rehderiana Chun could be used for ferulic acid
degradation, which has great potential for practical applications
in solving ferulic acid contaminated environments.
