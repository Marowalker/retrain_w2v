We describe a process for collecting
micro- and nanovesicles on
a glass substrate using the optical pressure of a laser beam. The
laser beam was focused on a glass substrate that sandwiched a solution
containing vesicles prepared using a phospholipid. The optical pressure
generated at the surface of the vesicles pulled them into the center
of the beam where they formed an aggregate on the glass surface. The
vesicles prepared with a buffer solution were successfully collected
via adsorption onto the glass surface, whereas the vesicles prepared
with pure water exhibited no such tendency. The time required to collect
a certain amount of vesicles was inversely proportional to their concentration.
To enhance the collection efficiency, we added gold nanoparticles
to the vesicle solution. The addition of gold nanoparticles into the
solution reduced the collection time to one-tenth of that without
it, and this was attributed to thermal mixing promoted by the heat
generated by the absorption from the gold nanoparticles in the solution,
as well as to an enhancement of light scattering induced by the gold
nanoparticles. The optical collection of vesicles coupled with gold
nanoparticles shows a promise for the collection of trace amounts
of extracellular vesicles in biological fluids.

==== Body
Introduction
Biological cells release
several types of extracellular vesicles:
exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. Among these, exosomes
have attracted much attention since 2007 when Lötvall’s
group discovered that micro-RNA resides in the body of exosomes.1 After that finding, many studies have focused
on the characterization and analysis of exosomes to clarify their
functions, roles, and utility. Exosomes are also expected to be novel
biomarkers for cancer because they should contain information on the
cells that release them.2−4

Exosomes are found in biological
fluids such as serum, saliva,
and urine, although their functions are not completely understood.
Clarification of the functions and characteristics of exosomes and
their components will require separation, concentration, and detection
techniques. Some of the well-known standard methods for collecting
exosomes include ultracentrifugation and differential ultracentrifugation.5,6 Other separation methods include size exclusion chromatography and
field-flow fractionation.7,8 Microfluidic devices
show a promise as platforms for the isolation, collection, and detection
of extracellular vesicles.9−11

Compared with these separation
methods, manipulation using optical
pressure, employed generally in laser trapping, optical trapping,
and optical tweezers,12 could be useful
for the collection of small vesicles. For example, in 1995, we developed
a separation method for micrometer-sized particles using optical pressure
referred to as optical chromatography13−15 that permitted the separation
of polymer particles and biological cells depending on their shapes
and refractive indices. Optical chromatography was expanded to microfluidic
systems to separate, concentrate, and fractionate polymer particles.16−19 Furthermore, Hart et al. demonstrated interesting results showing
that optical chromatography can discriminate between two closely related Bacillus spores.20,21 Conversely,
we recently reported the manipulation of oil droplets using optical
pressure to trap, contact, and coalesce oil droplets stabilized by
an emulsifier.22 These articles demonstrated
the usefulness of optical pressure for collecting micrometer-sized
particles, droplets, vesicles, and biological cells.

In this
study, we employed optical pressure in the collection of
micrometer- and nanometer-sized vesicles on a glass substrate in a
solution. The solution containing the vesicles was sandwiched between
two glass plates, and a laser beam was focused onto one of them. The
laser beam accelerated the propagation of the vesicles into the direction
of the beam and dragged them to its center, which resulted in an aggregation
of the vesicles onto the glass plate. To enhance the collection efficiency,
the vesicles were mixed with gold nanoparticles that were expected
to adsorb onto the surface of the vesicles and enhance the scattering
of light. The effect of the gold nanoparticles was evaluated according
to the time required to collect a certain amount of the vesicles on
the glass substrate.

Results and Discussion
Collection of Vesicles
In this study, micro- and nanovesicles
were collected on a glass substrate via optical pressure. In a preliminary
study, we prepared vesicles with a diameter of 1.0 μm using
deionized water and attempted to collect them on a hydrophilic glass
substrate. The collection of the vesicles prepared with deionized
water is shown in Figure 1a,b. When the laser irradiated a suspension of vesicles, the
vesicles were accelerated to the propagation direction of the laser
beam via a scattering force and were dragged into the center of the
beam by its gradient force, which is similar to the process of optical
chromatography.14 An aggregate of the vesicles
was formed at the beam spot of the laser on the glass substrate with
time (Figure 1a). When
the laser was turned off, however, the vesicles were immediately dispersed
(Figure 1b). These
results indicate that the vesicles were collected on the glass surface
via the optical pressure, but they were not adsorbed onto the glass
surface.

Figure 1 Images of the collected vesicles at different times. The concentration
of DPPC, 0.25 mM; size, 1.0 μm; and laser power, 60 mW. The
images were collected immediately after turning on the laser. (a)
Collection of the vesicles (30 min) prepared with deionized water;
(b) 2 min after turning off the laser in (a); (c) 30 min collection
of the vesicles prepared with PBS; and (d) 2 min after turning off
the laser in (c).

Adsorption of the vesicles
would be related to their surface charge,
which depends on the conditions of the surrounding medium. According
to the literature,23 the electric charges
of phospholipids vary depending on the pH and coexisting ions in the
medium. Phosphatidylcholine, for example, is positively charged in
an acidic pH lower than 3 and then suddenly is negatively charged
in water without salts. Conversely, in the presence of NaCl, the charge
of the vesicles changes gradually and becomes almost neutral in a
pH ranging from 3 to 7. Therefore, in deionized water, the vesicles
would be negatively charged, resulting in no adsorption on the surface
of the hydrophilic substrate because of the electrostatic repulsion.

To fix the vesicles on the glass substrate after turning off the
laser, we employed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) instead of deionized
water to hydrate dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The collection
of the vesicles prepared with PBS is shown in Figure 1c,d. The vesicles prepared with PBS were
successfully adsorbed onto the glass surface, even when the laser
was turned off (Figure 1d). The increased size of the aggregate can be seen over time. It
is obvious that the surrounding medium must contain salts to adsorb
the vesicles onto a glass substrate.

amount of vesicles at different
concentrations of DPPC. Red circle, in the absence of gold nanoparticles
and blue circle, in the presence of citrate-coated gold nanoparticles.
The size of the vesicles, 1.0 μm and laser power, 60 mW.

The collection speed was decreased
with decreases in the concentration
of DPPC that corresponded to the number of vesicles. The time required
to collect a constant amount of vesicles was inversely proportional
to the concentration of the DPPC. The time also increased when the
size of the vesicles was reduced to 100 nm, even though the required
number of vesicles was greater than 1.0 μm. For example, the
times required to collect an aggregate of 11 μm were 3 min for
1.0 μm vesicles and 25 min for 100 nm vesicles at 0.25 mM DPPC.
This fact can be explained by the dependence of the optical pressure
on the size of the particle because the intensity of the light on
the surface of a particle increases with increases in the size of
the particle. Therefore, the collection speed will definitely increase
with increases in the power of the laser because the optical pressure
is proportional to the power of the laser.24

Enhancement of Collection Speed with Gold Nanoparticles
To evaluate the collection speed, we determined the time required
to form 11 μm of an aggregate on a glass substrate at different
concentrations of DPPC, as shown in Figure 2 (red circle). The times totaled to 4 min
at 0.25 mM DPPC and more than 100 min at 0.01 mM DPPC, respectively.
Although a time of 100 min is much shorter than what is required for
ultracentrifugation that last for more than a day, further improvement
in the collection efficiency is preferable for practical applications.
Therefore, we attempted to employ gold nanoparticles because these
were expected to enhance the light scattering of the vesicles via
adsorption onto the surfaces of the vesicles.25

Figure 3 Experimental
setup for collecting vesicles by optical pressure.

We added two different gold nanoparticles, 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP)-coated and citrate-coated, to a suspension of the vesicles.
These nanoparticles were expected to exhibit different behaviors during
adsorption onto the vesicles because DMAP and citrate ions are cationic
and anionic, respectively. Therefore, these gold nanoparticles were
mixed with 1.0 μm suspension of vesicles.

The effect of
citrate-coated nanoparticles is shown in Figure 2 (blue circle). The
gold nanoparticles shortened the collection time to one-tenth at 0.01
mM DPPC. We speculated that DMAP-coated gold nanoparticles would be
adsorbed onto the vesicles more efficiently than citrate-coated versions
because the vesicles would theoretically have a weak negative charge.
However, no difference was observed between DMAP-coated and citrate-coated
gold nanoparticles. This fact implies that both anionic and cationic
gold nanoparticles would be adsorbed onto vesicles in the same degree
because they have a neutral surface charge. Otherwise, the adsorption
of gold nanoparticles would not be essential for enhancing the collection
efficiency.

It is interesting that under laser irradiation,
the behaviors of
the vesicles appeared different in the presence of gold nanoparticles.
In the presence of the gold nanoparticles, the vesicles were vigorously
stirred, as shown in the Supporting Information videos (Video S1 with and S2 without gold nanoparticles). The difference could have been because
of thermal convection induced by increases in temperature via the
light absorbed by the surrounding gold nanoparticles. The uncaptured
vesicles seemed to disperse radially from the beam spot in the presence
of gold nanoparticles (Video S1), whereas
they moved randomly in the absence of the gold nanoparticles (Video S2). The radial dispersion may have been
caused by the increased temperature within the laser beam when the
solution, heated by the light, generated convection to the outside
of the beam. This phenomenon was observed for both DMAP-coated and
citrate-coated gold nanoparticles, independent of the stabilizing
agent. This could be attributed to the similar molar extinction coefficients
of these gold nanoparticles at 532 nm (3.4 × 109 L
mol–1 cm–1 for citrate-coated
gold nanoparticles and 2.1 × 109 L mol–1 cm–1 for DMAP-coated gold nanoparticles).

On the basis of these results, the enhanced collection efficiency
in the presence of gold nanoparticles could be explained mainly by
thermal convection of the vesicles via light absorption by the free
gold nanoparticles. Other possible factors include collisions of accelerated
gold nanoparticles with vesicles and an enhancement in the light scattering
of the vesicles induced by the gold nanoparticles adsorbed onto the
vesicles. The thermal convection increased the probability that the
vesicles passed transversely across the laser beam. The gold nanoparticles
adsorbed onto the vesicles would generate strong optical pressure
via enhanced scattering originating from the surface plasmon. The
free gold nanoparticles also accelerated in the propagation direction
of the laser beam; therefore, they may have accelerated the vesicles
when they collided with them.

We needed to recover the vesicles
collected on the glass surface
for subsequent analysis. However, the adsorption of the vesicles was
too weak for recovery, so that they were peeled off the glass substrate
when it was removed from the well. Therefore, further improvements
in the collection system are required to apply the collected vesicles
to further chemical analysis. Examples of these improvements could
include either the use of a microfluidic device or a flow system coupled
with an analytical instrument.

Conclusions
We
have developed a method to collect vesicles on a glass substrate
via the optical pressure of a laser beam. The surrounding medium must
contain salts to control the surface charge of the vesicles. A medium
of biological fluids, in general, will contain an amount of salt sufficient
to allow the analysis. We also found that the addition of gold nanoparticles
significantly improved the collection efficiency. The effect of the
gold nanoparticles was attributed to thermal convection in the vesicles
via light absorption by the free gold nanoparticles and by collisions
of the accelerated gold nanoparticles with the vesicles, which enhanced
the light scattered among the vesicles. Further investigation is necessary,
however, to clarify the mechanisms of the enhanced collection efficiency.
The use of gold nanoparticles in optical manipulation would be useful
for efficiently collecting micro- and nanovesicles in small volumes
of biological fluids.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
of the reagents used in this study were
of analytical grade. Deionized water was prepared by means of an Elix
water purification system (Millipore Co. Ltd., Molsheim, France).
DPPC was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). PBS
was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Yokohama, Japan). Acetone,
chloroform, toluene, sodium sulfate anhydrous (Na2SO4), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), sodium tetrachloroaurate(III)
dihydrate (NaAuCl4·2H2O), DMAP, and tetraoctylammonium
bromide were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka,
Japan). Ethanol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid, and
30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were obtained from
Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan).

Preparation of Vesicles
A 4.15 μL aliquot of
30 mM DPPC in chloroform was transferred to a glass tube. The chloroform
was evaporated via injection of nitrogen gas. After the removal of
chloroform, the glass tube was placed in a vacuum desiccator for 1–3
h. To prepare the vesicles, 500 μL of deionized water or PBS
was added to the glass tube followed by further sonication (55 °C
for 30 s) and stirring (for 30 s) thrice. The size of the vesicles
was adjusted using a Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) with a 1.00
or 0.1 μm polycarbonate membrane. The final concentration of
DPPC in the suspension was estimated at 0.25 mM. The suspension was
successively diluted to prepare suspensions with concentrations lower
than 0.25 mM.

Preparation of Gold Nanoparticles Coated
with DMAP
We prepared gold nanoparticles coated with DMAP
according to a procedure
found in the literature.26 A 20 mL aliquot
of 100 mM tetraoctylammonium bromide dissolved in toluene was gathered
in a separation funnel. A 7.5 mL aliquot of 20 mM NaAuCl4 aqueous solution was added to the separation funnel, followed by
shaking to mix the organic and aqueous phases. The solution was let
to stand, and then the metal salt was transferred to the toluene phase
within a few seconds. Then, 6.25 mL of freshly prepared 0.4 M NaBH4 was added to the mixture, which caused an immediate reduction
of the Au(III). After 30 min, the aqueous phase was removed, and the
toluene phase was washed with 10 mL of 0.1 M H2SO4, 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, and 10 mL of deionized water thrice, followed
by drying with anhydrous Na2SO4. An aqueous
solution of 1 mM DMAP (1 mL) was added to 1 mL of the toluene phase,
and the mixture was shaken, which resulted in DMAP-coated gold nanoparticles
in the aqueous solution. The size of the nanoparticles was estimated
at 25 nm based on the UV–vis spectrum.27

Preparation of Gold Nanoparticles Coated with Citrate
Citrate-coated
gold nanoparticles were prepared according a procedure
cited in the literature.28 A 100 mL aliquot
of deionized water was placed in a sample bottle, followed by the
addition of 500 μL of 0.059 M NaAuCl4 and 3.5 mL
of 3% (w/v) trisodium citrate solution. The mixture was heated at
80 °C for 3 h to reduce Au(III) to Au(0). The reaction was quenched
by cooling to room temperature, which changed the solution color from
yellow to red. The sizes of the nanoparticles were estimated at 30
nm based on the UV–vis spectrum.27

Preparation of Samples
We prepared three different
samples containing vesicles: (i) a mixture of a vesicle suspension
and PBS at a ratio of 1:1; (ii) a mixture of a vesicle suspension
and 0.3 nM DMAP-coated gold nanoparticle solution at a ratio of 1:1;
and (iii) a mixture of a vesicle suspension and 0.3 nM citrate-coated
gold nanoparticle solution at a ratio of 1:1. These mixtures were
directly introduced into a well for collecting the vesicles via optical
pressure.

Fabrication of the Collection Well
Piranha treatment
was performed to hydrophilize the glass surface by immersing the glass
substrate overnight into a mixture of H2SO4 and
30% H2O2 at a ratio of 1:3. The hydrophilic
glass substrate was washed with deionized water and dried at room
temperature.

A collection well was fabricated by sandwiching
a silicon rubber sheet (thickness, 1 mm, AS ONE, Osaka, Japan) between
two glass substrates [glass slide (thickness, 1.0 mm) or cover glass
(thickness, 0.12–0.17 mm)]. The silicon rubber sheet was cut
in a square shape (18 × 18 mm) with a 5 mm diameter hole at the
center. The silicon rubber sheet was placed on a glass slide, and
then a sample solution was poured into the hole. The hole was covered
with either a cover glass or a glass slide that was firmly attached
to the silicon rubber sheet to prevent leakage of the solution.

Experimental Setup
The experimental setup is shown
in Figure 3. An Nd:YAG
laser (532 nm, maximum power, 3 W, Beamtech Optronics, Beijing, China)
was introduced into an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE2000-S, Nicon,
Japan) via a dichroic mirror (Di02-R514-25×36, Semrok, NY, USA)
and an objective lens (×40, N. A. 0.6). The power of the laser
at the objective lens was adjusted to 60 mW through all experiments.
The surface of the glass substrate was monitored using a CCD camera
(WAT-221S, Watece, NY, USA) interfaced with a PC via a TV capture
board (PCast, PC-MV5DX/U2, Buffalo, Aichi, Japan). A notch filter
(Techapec rugate notch filter, 532 nm, optical density >4, stock
number
#46–565, Edmund Optics, NJ, USA) was placed in front of the
CCD camera to exclude the scattered light from the laser beam. The
collection well was placed on the stage of the microscope, and the
laser beam was focused onto the surface of the upper glass substrate.
