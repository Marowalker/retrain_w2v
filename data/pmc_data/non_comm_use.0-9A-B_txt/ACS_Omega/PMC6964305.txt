The synthesis of 4′-methoxymethyl threofuranosyl
(4′-MOM-TNA)
thymidine and derived oligomers of the G-rich thrombin-binding aptameric
(TBA) sequence is reported. The G-quadruplex stability, anticoagulation
activity, and the enzymatic stability of these oligomers bearing the
2′-3′-phosphodiester backbone as single substitutions
in the loop regions are studied. Amongst all the oligomers, TBA-7T
bearing the 4′-MOM-TNA unit at the T7 position formed a quadruplex
with the highest thermal stability. It also resulted in enhanced anticlotting
activity that allowed a one-third reduction in the dose, relative
to TBA. Further, TBA-7T exhibited enhanced nuclease resistance properties
to both endo- and exonucleases.

==== Body
Introduction
The pentadecameric thrombin-binding aptamer1 (TBA, 5′-G1G2T3T4G5G6T7G8T9G10G11T12T13G14G15) has been extensively studied
and is well characterized.
TBA folds into an intramolecular antiparallel G-quadruplex that consists
of two G-quartets that are connected by two TT loops and a central
TGT loop in a chair-like conformation. TBA is reported to interact
with its target, thrombin, mainly through its loop regions, particularly
the TT loops.2 Owing to its promising potential
as a heparin alternative in medicine, it has attracted the attention
of researchers who strive to improve its nuclease- and thermal stability
properties.3−5 However, most of the modifications failed to improve
its thermal stability. Among the notable exceptions are the 3′-3′
polarity inversion at the 3′-end,6 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine,7 and
the unlocked nucleic acid (UNA),8 which
also offered increased resistance to degradation by nucleases. UNA,
by virtue of its “unlocked” flexible nature, could help
to ease the strain in the loop regions of TBA and had a maximum stabilizing
effect (Tm enhancement of 4 °C) and
anticoagulation activity when incorporated at the T7 position in the
TGT loop of TBA.8

We earlier reported
the 2′-5′-phosphodiester-linked
backbone (isoDNA, Figure 1), which also has increased nuclease resistance in comparison
to the native 3′-5′-phosphodiesters, in TBA.9 In contrast to other reports where backbone modifications
were reported to significantly impact the structural topology of the
resulting quadruplex,10 we found that the
2′-5′-linked isoTBA was able to retain the unimolecular
antiparallel quadruplex topology of TBA and additionally exhibit thrombin-binding
and anticoagulant properties9 even when
the total number of loop residues was significantly reduced.11 The 2′-3′-phosphodiester backbone
was reported in the (l)-α-threofuranosyl nucleic acid
(TNA)12 (Figure 1). TNA was demonstrated to be capable of
informational self-pairing and specifically hydrogen-bonding with
complementary DNA and RNA. The quasi-diaxial nature of the 2′-3′-phosphodiester
link ensured that the shortened 5-atom internucleotide distance was
well tolerated in the formation of duplexes,12 tertiary structures,13 and quadruplexes.14 Although S-type sugar puckers as in DNA are
preferred in the loop regions of TBA over the N-type puckers, the
shorter five-atom internucleotide link in TNA makes the backbone compact,
similar to that seen in DNA with the S-type of sugar pucker, as reported
in the X-ray structure of a B-type DNA duplex incorporating a single
TNA residue, where only minimum perturbation of the backbone around
the TNA residue15 was observed. Proposing
to combine the advantages of TNA and a methoxy substituent, we envisioned
the 4′-methoxymethyl TNA (4′-MOM-TNA, Figure 1), and its incorporation in
the loop regions of TBA.

Figure 1 Structures of natural DNA/RNA, isoDNA, UNA,
TNA, and 4′-MOM-TNA
of the present work.

Inclusion of a methoxy substituent in the ribose/deoxyribose
sugar
moiety in nucleosides is known to impart stability against nuclease
degradation. Methoxy substitutions at the 2′- position16 and 4′-position17,18 have been reported to render the oligonucleotides resistant to exo-
and endonucleases, depending on the position of the methoxy-substituted
nucleotide in the oligomer. The −OMe substitution was reported
to additionally increase the stability of the resulting duplexes with
complementary DNA/RNA.16,18 5′-OMe substitutions in
siRNA duplexes were reported to be useful in controlling the targeting
specificity in RNAi.19 We recently showed
that inclusion of a single 2′-OMe-substituted nucleoside in
the loop region of TBA was well tolerated in spite of the sugar being
in the N-type puckered conformation.20

The methoxymethyl substituent at C4′ that is reported in
this work may be expected to contribute toward enhancing the nuclease
resistance properties of the resulting oligomers, besides favorably
influencing hydration in its vicinity. Thus, in this paper, we report
the synthesis of 4′-MOM-TNA and study the effect of single
nucleotide substitution in the loop regions of TBA on the stability
of the G-quadruplex and its thrombin-binding, anticoagulant, and endo-
and exonuclease resistance properties.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of 4′-Methoxymethyl TNA-T Monomers
A straightforward route for the synthesis of 4′-MOM-TNA-T
phosphoramidite was followed using commercially available d-xylose as the starting material (Scheme 1). d-Xylose 1 was transformed
to 1,2-O-isopropylidene-α-d-xylofuranose 2 using acetone, conc. H2SO4, and then
Na2CO3 in a one-pot reaction.21 Monomethylation of the primary hydroxyl group by methyl
iodide in the presence of silver oxide yielded 3. The
secondary hydroxyl group was converted to its allyloxycarbonyl derivative 4 in 70% yield. The compound 4 was converted
into its diacetate 5 after acetonide removal in the presence
of AcOH and Ac2O and a catalytic amount of H2SO4. Compound 5 on treatment with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA),
thymine, and TMS-OTf yielded compound 6 exclusively as
the β-anomer. The alloc group was selectively cleaved using
Pd(0) to get 7, and the 3′-hydroxyl group was
converted to its DMT derivative using 2,4,6-collidine as a base to
get 8. The 2′-hydroxyl group in compound 8 was deprotected by ammonolysis to obtain compound 9, which was phosphitylated using 2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphine to yield the phosphoramidite
monomer 10. All compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and HRMS analysis, and the phosphoramidite 10 was characterized by 31P NMR spectroscopy (Supporting
Information, Figures S1 and S2).

Synthesis of TBA Oligomers
The synthesis of TBA oligomers
was carried out on the solid phase using phosphoramidite chemistry
on a Bioautomation MM4 DNA synthesizer. An extended coupling time
of 2 min was used for the 4′-MOM-TNA-T units, which were introduced
as single substitutions at the 3-, 4-, 7-, 9-, 12-, or 13-position
in the loop regions of TBA to yield TBA oligomers TBA-3T, TBA-4T,
TBA-7T, TBA-9T, TBA-12T, and TBA-13T respectively. For comparison,
3′-deoxy-thymidine-2′-phosphoramidite was used to introduce
a single 2′-5′-linked T unit at the seventh or ninth
position of TBA (TBA-7Tiso and TBA-9Tiso, respectively).
This isoDNA unit presents the sugar in the N-type pucker with an extended
backbone.9 All the synthesized oligomers
are listed in Table 1 were purified by HPLC, their identity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF
mass analysis, and their purity was re-confirmed by analytical HPLC
and gel electrophoresis (Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4).

Evaluating G-Quadruplex Formation and Thermal Stability
CD spectra were recorded to evaluate the influence of the 4′-MOM-TNA-T
and 2′-5′- backbone on the overall G-quadruplex structure
of TBA. As reported for TBA, all the modified oligomers displayed
CD signatures typical of antiparallel G-quadruplexes22 in the presence of K+ ions, with maxima near
290 nm and minima near 260 nm (Figure 2). The differences in the amplitude of the CD signal
could reflect the efficiency of base stacking. TBA oligomers containing
the 4′-MOM-TNA unit at the T7 position was particularly different
from the rest of the oligomers and showed a stronger CD signal than
even TBA. Further, TBA-7T also displayed the characteristic bands
of the antiparallel G-quadruplex in the presence of sodium ions and
even in the absence of any added cations (Supporting Information, Figure S5).

Figure 2 CD spectra of the TBA oligomers in the
presence of K+ ions. Spectra were recorded in 10 mM potassium
phosphate buffer,
pH 7.5, containing 100 mM KCl at 4 °C.

The stability of the G-quadruplexes was determined
by monitoring
the change in CD amplitude at 295 nm with temperature (Supporting
Information, Figure S6). TBA-7T was found
to form the most stable complex in the presence of K+ ions,
with a Tm of 60 °C, a stabilization
of 10 °C in comparison to TBA (Table 2). This stabilization is more than that reported
for a UNA modification at the same position, where a stabilization
of 4 °C was observed8 and similar
to the stabilization observed when 5-fluorodeoxyuridine was substituted
at the T4 or T13 position.7 The TBA-7Tiso quadruplex that also showed an appreciable CD signal in
the presence of K+ melted at 47 °C, close to the Tm of TBA. All the other TBA oligomers were destabilized
in comparison to TBA to a much higher extent (ΔTm = −10 to −16 °C; Table 2) and displayed a low intensity
CD signal at 295 nm with a weak negative band at ∼260 nm (Figure 2). TBA-7T was also
found to fold into a stable quadruplex in the presence of Na+ ions (Supporting Information, Figures S5b and S6b) with Tm = 51 °C (ΔTm = +29 °C in comparison to TBA) and also
in the absence of any added cations (Supporting Information, Figure S7 and Table S1; Tm = 28 °C, ΔTm = +9
°C in comparison to TBA). Thus, among all the oligomers studied,
TBA-7T was found to form quadruplexes with the highest thermal stability.
This indicates that, although 4′-MOM-TNA has the sugar in the
N-type of pucker, together with a shorter backbone, it is well accommodated
at the T7 position in the TGT loop of TBA. A similar stabilization
of ∼10 °C for single substitutions was reported when the
T4 or T13 units were replaced by 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine,
where the stabilization was found to be largely enthalpy-driven.7 The changes in enthalpy and entropy for the two-state
transition observed for the TBA oligomers were calculated from a van’t
Hoff analysis of the CD equilibrium melting curves.23,24 The data are presented in Table 3, and representative plots of ln K versus 1/T are shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S8). The data suggest that the
stabilization observed with TBA-T7 is largely enthalpy-driven.

The effect of the 4′-MOM-TNA unit on the G-quadruplex
and
its thermal stability may be explained in context of the neighboring
nucleosides, together with the compact nature of the 2′-3′-backbone
with the sugar in an N-type conformation. We previously reported20 that N-type sugar modifications in the form
of 2′-OMe-substituted nucleosides imparted controlled compactness
and were favorably accommodated as single substitutions in the loop
regions of TBA. G10 is a part of the G-tetrad upon which the T9 thymine
is reported to stack flatly,25 contributing
to the thermal stability of the quadruplex and the intensity of the
observed CD spectrum. Replacement of T9 by a 4′-MOM-TNA unit
would directly impact this interaction, the shorter backbone together
with the N-type of sugar pucker probably leading to excessive compactness
in this case, and resulting in destabilization of the quadruplex.
Replacement of T4 or T13, which are also reported to be stacked on
the G-tetrad,25 by 4′-MOM-TNA, therefore
similarly result in a large destabilization of the quadruplex. On
the other hand, the T rings of T3, T12, and T7 are tilted away from
their succeeding nucleobase,25 and replacement
of these causes a lower degree of destabilization. T7 is positioned
sideways into the wide groove of the quadruplex,25 and its replacement by 4′-MOM-TNA probably leads
to compactness that is favorable in this case, which also possibly
enhances the stacking of G8 on the G-tetrad, leading to an increased
intensity of the observed CD maximum and a concomitant increased thermal
stability of the quadruplex.

NMR studies were carried out with
the most stable G-quadruplex,
that is, of TBA-7T. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the characteristic
hydrogen-bonded imino proton resonances of a G-quadruplex were observed
between 11.5 and 12.5 ppm in the presence of K+ ions (Figure 3a). These signals
appeared slightly downfield to those observed for TBA, probably indicative
of the stronger hydrogen-bonding in the case of TBA-7T. A similar
downfield shift in the case of stronger hydrogen-bonding has been
reported for phenolic compounds.26 The
signal near 11.2 ppm observed for TBA was shown to correspond to the
imino proton signal of T7, which is close to the imino proton resonances
of T4 and T13, all of which are not involved in the H-bonded G-tetrad.9,25,27 These signals at 11.2 ppm were
not apparent for TBA-7T or are possibly also shifted slightly, displaying
a difference in comparison to TBA. The imino proton resonances characteristic
of H-bonded G-tetrads in quadruplexes were observed even in water,
with no added cation (Figure 3b), indicating the capability of the oligomers to fold into
stable quadruplexes in cation-free conditions.

Antithrombin Activity Studies
We further investigated
whether the higher thermal stability of the TBA-7T G-quadruplex would
translate into its antithrombin activity, although it has been reported
that the two may not necessarily be related.3 TBA-7T was found to form a stable complex with thrombin, with a Tm of 32 °C (Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S9). The antithrombin activity of the
TBA oligomers was investigated by measuring the percent transmittance
at 450 nm as a function of time (Supporting Information, Figure S10) and recording the induction time
for conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of thrombin.
TBA was found to slow down the coagulation, evident from an increased
induction time in comparison to that in the absence of any added oligomer
as reported previously28 (Figure 4a). The induction time for
TBA-7T (26.7 min) was higher than for TBA (11.2 min) at the same concentration,
thus offering the possibility to reduce the concentration of TBA oligomer
required to bring it within a more acceptable therapeutic range. Toward
further exploring this possibility, we carried out the clotting assay
at successively decreasing concentrations of TBA-7T and found that
TBA-7T showed a comparable induction time to TBA at less than one-third
of its concentration (Figure 4b). These experiments thus provide conclusive evidence that
TBA-7T is capable of forming a stable G-quadruplex with similar structural
topology as TBA and also positively impacting the assigned function
of TBA. In comparison, TBA-7Tiso, with an induction time
of 7.2 min, was less efficient than even TBA at inhibiting clotting
(Figure 4a). Anticoagulation
experiments performed with human plasma and thrombin further demonstrated
TBA-7T to be as good as TBA (Figure S11).

Figure 4 Antithrombin activity obtained from transmittance measurements
at 450 nm and plotted as induction time (a) in the presence of selected
TBA oligomers of the study and (b) for TBA-7T at decreasing concentrations
in comparison to TBA. Control represents the measurement with fibrinogen
(Sigma, product no. F3897) and thrombin (bovine thrombin, Tulip Diagnostics
(P) Ltd.) in the absence of any added TBA oligomer.

Nuclease Stability Studies
In addition to enhancing
the thermal stability and anticlotting ability of TBA, another objective
of introducing modified units into its sequence was to increase the
stability of the resulting oligomers toward degradation by nucleases.
The stability of TBA and TBA-7T oligomers to nuclease degradation
was therefore compared. Snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPD), which
possesses predominantly 3′-exonuclease activity, and S1 nuclease,
an endonuclease, were used. We reasoned that any hydrolysis of phosphodiester
linkages would result in a loss of the quadruplex structure, which
would be immediately apparent from the CD spectra of the TBA oligomer.
The percent change in the CD amplitude at 295 nm, characteristic of
the G-quadruplex, was therefore monitored as a function of time to
obtain a measure of the nuclease stability of the oligomer. TBA-7T
was found to be much stable (t1/2 >
120
min) than TBA, which exhibited a half-life of ∼35 min when
treated with SVPD (Figure 5a). A similar trend was observed for the oligomers with S1
nuclease (Figure 5b),
where TBA displayed a t1/2 of ∼35
min, while for TBA-7T, this was >105 min. In the absence of nuclease,
the change in the CD amplitude at 295 nm was very minimal (Supporting
Information, Figure S12). This was further
confirmed when the reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis (Supporting
Information, Figures S13 and S14).

and (b) S1 nuclease (53.4 U/mL).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the design and synthesis
of 4′-MOM-TNA is
reported for the first time. Its effect when substituted at the T7
position of TBA was found to be beneficial, causing a large increase
in thermal stability that also translated into anticlotting activity.
The stabilizing effect was even better than observed earlier with
UNA, indicating the optimum attributes offered by the 4′-MOM-TNA
unit when placed at the T7 position. Further, TBA-7T was found to
have enhanced stability toward endo- and exonucleases. Its strong
anticlotting activity allowed for a 3-fold reduction in the dose required
toward potential therapeutic application.

Synthesis of Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were
synthesized by β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry on a Bioautomation
Mermade-4 DNA synthesizer. The 2′-Deoxy-3′-phosphoramidites
were obtained from Innovassynth Technologies India Ltd. For the TMOM-TNA- and Tiso-modified units, double coupling (120 s × 2) was carried out.
Oligonucleotides were cleaved from the solid support by treatment
with aq. ammonia. After preliminary purification by gel filtration
through Pharmacia NAP-5 columns, they were purified by RP-HPLC (Waters
Delta 600e quaternary solvent delivery system, 2998 photodiode array
detector, and Empower2 chromatography software) on a C18 column using
an increasing gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate
(pH 7.0). Their purity was reassessed by analytical HPLC and denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Supporting Information, Figure S4), and they were characterized by MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry. The oligomer concentration was calculated by absorbance
measurements using the molar extinction coefficients of the corresponding
DNA nucleobases.30

CD Experiments
For CD experiments, the TBA oligomers
were taken at a strand concentration of 5 μM. Na/K-phosphate
buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) was used, which contained 100 mM NaCl/KCl,
respectively. Oligomers were annealed by heating at 90 °C for
2 min, slowly cooled to room temperature, and refrigerated at ∼10
°C for at least 4 h before the start of the experiments. For
thrombin-binding studies, oligomers were annealed in water followed
by thrombin addition prior to the melting experiment. CD spectra were
recorded in a 2 mm path length cuvette using a resolution of 1 nm,
bandwidth of 1 nm, sensitivity of 20 mdeg, response of 1 s, and a
scan speed of 100 nm/min. Three scans were accumulated for each sample.
CD melting was performed by monitoring the CD intensity at 295 nm
over a temperature range of 5–90 °C. CD melting curves
were subjected to the van’t Hoff analysis for a two-state transition;
the enthalpy change (ΔH) and entropy change
(ΔS) for the transition were then calculated23,24 using the fraction of oligomer folded (α) at any given temperature
(T). The natural logarithm of the folding constant K was plotted against the reciprocal of the temperature,
and the data was restricted to the temperature range for which the
fraction folded was between 0.03 and 0.97 to ensure the most linear
part of the graph, where K was calculated according
to the formula  

The slope of the linear fit of this
plot is −ΔH/R, while
the Y intercept is ΔS/R, where R is the universal gas constant
and is equal to 1.98 cal/mol.

UV-Transmittance Measurements for Clotting Inhibition Assay
UV-transmittance studies were performed on a Varian Cary 300 Bio
UV-Visible spectrophotometer when the % transmittance change was monitored
with time. A 0.1 NIH unit of thrombin (50 NIH/mL, bovine thrombin,
Fibroscreen reagent, Tulip Diagnostics (P) Ltd.) was added to an aqueous
solution of TBA, TBA-7T, or TBA-9T oligomer (3.7 × 10–8 M) and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The TBA oligomer-thrombin
solution was added to a 1.0 mL fibrinogen solution (3.0 × 10–6 M, Sigma F 3879) in saline (0.85%), and the transmittance
at 450 nm was measured at 3 min intervals for a period of 90 min.

Thrombin Time Measurements for Clotting Inhibition
The inhibitory activity of the TBA oligomers on the thrombin-catalyzed
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin was assessed by a thrombin time
assay. The time for clot formation at 37 °C was measured on a
STart Max coagulation analyzer (Stago). Each experiment was repeated
at least three times; the standard deviation was ±1 s. Bovine
thrombin (Tulip Diagnostics, 0.1 NIH unit) was pre-incubated with
the TBA oligomer taken at a 0.25 μM concentration for 2 min
before addition to fibrinogen from human plasma (2.65 μM, Aldrich
F-3897) and measurement of clotting time (thrombin time). For thrombin
time measurements with plasma, thrombin (Diagnostica Stago STA-Thrombin,
REF 00611, 0.075 NIH unit) was pre-incubated with the TBA oligomer
taken at 0.25 μM for 2 min before addition to plasma (HemosIL,
Normal Control Assayed 0020003110) and measurement of clotting time
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each commercial reagent
was re-constituted according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Quadruplex Stability Studies in the Presence of Nucleases
Quadruplex stability studies of TBA and TBA-7T (7.5 μM) were
carried out at 37 °C in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing
15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, and SVPD (6.6 U/μL) and
with 5 μM strand concentration in reaction buffer (pH 4.5) containing
100 mM KCl, 0.5 M sodium acetate, 2.8 M NaCl, and 45 mM ZnSO4 for S1 nuclease (53.4 U/mL). CD spectra were recorded from 320 to
220 nm and the stability of the quadruplex was monitored by the change
in the CD amplitude at 295 nm with time after addition of the respective
nuclease. The CD amplitude was plotted against the reaction time.
When the S1 nuclease stability was monitored by HPLC, S1 nuclease
(89 U/mL) was used with 7.5 μM TBA or TBA-7T at 37 °C in
reaction buffer (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 M sodium acetate, 2.8 M NaCl,
and 45 mM ZnSO4. Aliquots were removed at successive time
points and analyzed by RP-HPLC to reveal the quantity of oligonucleotides
left intact after heating at 90 °C for 2 min to inactivate the
nuclease.

NMR Experiments of Oligomers
1H NMR spectra
of the oligomers were recorded at 4 °C using a Bruker AV 500
NMR spectrometer. The signals corresponding to the solvent water were
suppressed. TBA and TBA-7T (100 μM) were dissolved in 150 μL
of 10 mM K-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM KCl and lyophilized
and then taken up in 9:1 (v/v) H2O/D2O.
