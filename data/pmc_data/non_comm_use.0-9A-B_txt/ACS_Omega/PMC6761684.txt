Lanthanide
(Ln) based luminescent materials are experiencing an increasing interest
in their applications in several fields. In this study, we report
a series of new lanthanide-oligomeric brush films, supported on quartz
substrates and prepared using a layer-by-layer method (LbL). Oligomeric
brush films are composed of small oligomers from our previously reported
coordination polymers [x-EuL] and [x-TbL] (with x = 1, 3, and 5 generations of Ln complexes),
which are grown perpendicularly from a carboxylate self-assembled
monolayer. Oligomers composed of our previously described helical
lanthanide complex LnL (Ln: Eu and Tb) as a luminescent moiety and
benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate acid (bdc) used as a linker. Mixed films
having the fifth-generation Ln complexes composed of equimolar mixture
of Eu and Tb ions were prepared. Oligomeric brush films are highly
transparent and exhibited a colored emission under UV irradiation.
Pure Ln (Eu or Tb) films showed a strong luminescence from the Ln
ions. Their luminescent properties depended on the number of lanthanide
layers in the films composed of the first to third generations of
lanthanide complexes. Then, the increase of the complex layers induced
no difference in the luminescent properties. An energy transfer from
Tb to Eu ions in the mixed films indicated a short distance between
lanthanide ions of a fifth layer. The structural analysis together
with the observed luminescent properties and some previous studies
allowed to clarify the disposition of the oligomers in the films.

Introduction
For a few decades,
lanthanides (Ln) compounds have been attracting increasing interest
in the development of innovative materials for several applications.1−9 Owing to their specific electronic composition, Ln ions show photoluminescence
due to the f−f transitions. Direct sensing of Ln ions is an
inefficient process due to the Laporte forbidden 4f–4f transitions.
However, Ln ions can be photosensitized by the coordination of π-conjugated
organic ligands. In this system, the organic ligand acts as a photoantenna
that can transfer, after excitation, energy from the ligand excited
triplet state to the excited state of the lanthanide. Then, the relaxation
of the energy from the excited level to the fundamental level of the
Ln ion produces a long (μs to ms) and sharp luminescence emission
that is sparsely affected by the surrounding environment.10−13 Lanthanide luminescence was used in several applications,14−24 especially to generate emitting materials by immobilizing monolayer
or polylayers of Ln complexes on several substrates.25−36 In contemporary chemistry, the functionalization of surfaces with
hierarchical mono- and polylayers presents a great interest and is
used in several technological applications.37−49

Controlling the coordination geometry around lanthanides is
difficult and results in a complex prediction of the lanthanide coordination
sphere. Consequently, the synthesis of lanthanide luminescent films
by using supramolecular and coordination chemistry is an important
challenge for the research of composite materials and can explain,
from our knowledge, the lack of studies of lanthanide coordination
polymer brush films.

Previously, we had reported the synthesis
of monodimensional coordination polymers with Ln ions in the solid
state. The coordination polymers were composed of a helical lanthanide
complex EuL or/and TbL connected to a dicarboxylate linker such as
benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate acid (bdc) or 2-aminoterephtalte (atpa)
(Figure 1).50

Figure 1 Measured molecular structure and molecular size of (a)
LnL complex (Ln = Eu or Tb) and (b) spacers. (c) Schematic representation
of LnL polymer with bdc in the solid state.

Eu–Tb-mixed coordination polymers were luminescent, and their
properties were dependent on the temperature and polymer composition.
Indeed, when bdc was used as a linker, the polymer chains were spaced
at 14.4 Å. This distance is too long to observe an energy transfer
between Eu and Tb ions. By replacing the linker by atpa, the interaction
between polymer chains was increased and modified the packing structure.
This modification reduced the distance between the lanthanide ions
and allowed an efficient energy transfer between Tb and Eu ions.

Herein, based on our previous study, we report the synthesis and
luminescent properties of lanthanide oligomeric brush films with Eu
or Tb oligomers. Oligomeric brush films, [x-EuL]
and [x-TbL] (with x = 1, 3, and
5 generations of Ln complexes), are composed of small oligomers by
linked alternatively of the LnL complex (Ln = Tb or Eu) and bdc. Oligomers
are grown perpendicularly from a quartz substrate, forming a brushlike
film. The films were prepared on carboxylate self-assembled monolayer
(SAM)’s quartz substrates using the layer-by-layer (LbL) method.
From the SAM’s substrates, oligomers were grown by alternate
chemisorption of LnL complexes (Eu or Tb) and bdc compound. In addition,
the mixed films [4-EuL-5Tb/EuL] and [4-TbL-5Tb/EuL], whose fifth-generation
Ln complex was composed of an equimolar mixture of Eu and Tb ions,
were prepared. All films showed intense luminescence from Ln ions
under UV irradiation. The effects of the generation number and the
layer composition on luminescent properties were discussed. Finally,
structural analysis and luminescence properties were correlated to
propose a possible oligomer aggregation into the luminescent films.

Results
and Discussion
SAM’s Quartz Preparation
Carboxylate SAM’s quartz functionalization was followed by
water contact angle measurement (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Values of the water contact angle of modified
quartz substrates in each step.

Hydrophilic or hydrophobic behavior of the surface influences the
water contact angle of a substrate. After the hydroxylation of commercial
quartz (Quartz-OH), the water contact angle decreased drastically
due to the presence of hydroxyl groups, highly hydrophilic, on the
quartz surface. The addition of a propyl chain and an amine group
increased the hydrophobic behavior of the quartz (Quartz-NH2), which is associated with the increase of the water contact angle.
Functionalization with a hydrophilic carboxylic acid (Quartz-COOH)
and its transformation into sodium carboxylate (Quartz-COONa) decreased
the water contact angle, pointing out an increase of the hydrophilic
behavior of the quartz substrate.

Lanthanide Films Preparation
Lanthanide films were prepared from the carboxylate SAM’s
quartz substrate using the LbL method (Figures 3 and S1). The
detailed procedure is given in Materials and Methods.

Figure 3 Schematic representation of the layer-by-layer process for the preparation
of pure lanthanide brush films and representation of the (a) first-,
(b) third-, and (c) fifth-generation films.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the
atomic composition of the films (Figures S2–S5). All EuL films showed the existence of the binding energy band
of the Eu 3d XPS band and confirmed the good chemisorption of EuL
on the quartz substrate. The increase of the generation number or
the addition of the bdc spacer induced no differences in the binding
energy of the Eu 3d band (Figure S2). Addition
of a bdc linker [1-EuL-bdc] was associated to the disappearance of
the component corresponding to the nitrate ion and the apparition
of a new component with a bigger intensity in the N 1s band (Figure S3). This new component at 402 eV was
associated with the N 1s energy binding of the protonated Et3NH+, which acted as a counteranion of the bdc linker.
The coordination of a new EuL complex provoked its disappearance and
the recurrence of the band corresponding to the nitrate ion as observed
for [3-EuL] and [5-EuL] films (Figure S3). Similar observations were made for Tb films. The binding energy
of the Tb 4d orbital was observed in every Tb film (Figure S4), indicating the chemisorption of the TbL complex.
Again, the addition of bdc in the [1-TbL-bdc] film was correlated
with the disappearance of the nitrate component in the N 1s around
401 eV and apparition of the N 1s assigned to Et3NH+ appeared at a higher side than that of nitrate . This band
disappeared in the [3-TbL] and [5-TbL] films (Figure S5). Finally, the presence of the binding energy of
Tb 4d and Eu 3d in the XPS analysis of [4-EuL-5Tb/EuL] and [4-TbL-5Tb/EuL]
was in correlation with the composition of the fifth-generation films.

AFM Analysis
Figure 4 shows AFM images of the commercial quartz substrate, carboxylate
SAM’s quartz, and EuL films (more detailed images and TbL films
images are given in the Figure S6).

Figure 4 AFM images
and surface profile of quartz (a), carboxylate SAM’s quartz
(b), [1-EuL] (c), [1-EuL-bdc] (d), [3-EuL] (e), and [5-EuL] (f).

As observed in the AFM images, the commercial quartz
plate had a rough surface with several nanoscratches. After SAM’s
functionalization (Figure 4b), the rough surface parameter (Ra) decreased drastically due to the leveling of the surface by several
acidic treatments during the SAM’s preparation. The increase
of the Ra parameter for the [1-EuL] film
(Figure 4c) indicated
a slightly rougher surface. No change in the roughness was observed
with the addition of the bdc linker (Figure 4d). Again, the augmentation of Ra parameters for the [3-EuL] (Figure 4e) and [5-EuL] films (Figure 4f) suggested the increase of the surface
roughness with the growth of the film. The average maximum high (Rz) increased with the number of layers. This
augmentation is in association with the increase of the size of oligomers,
confirming the growth of the films with the number of dipping cycles.

The surface profile of the carboxylate SAM’s quartz shows
the formation of small domains about 10 nm in diameter, which were
not visible in commercial quartz. Growth of the films did not affect
significantly the size of these domains. The average domain size of
the fifth-generation films was only slightly increased at 13 nm, indicating
no lateral extension during the growth.

Luminescence Properties
Under UV excitation (λex = 315 nm), the EuL films
emitted a red emission characteristic of the Eu ions (Figure 5). The emission spectra of
the EuL films showed six sharp bands at 579, 590, 616, 649.5, and
685 (br) nm, which correspond to the Eu f–f transitions 5D0 → 7F0, 4D0 → 7F1, 4D0 → 7F2, 4D0 → 7F3, and 4D0 → 7F4, respectively. All films showed
similar emission shape, indicating a similar complex composition (Figure 5a–d). The
Eu emission from the films was slightly different from the EuL emission
from the solid state (5D0 → 7F1); the excitation spectra coincided with the absorption
spectra of the organic ligand and confirmed that the Eu emission was
exclusively provided by an energy transfer from the organic ligand
(all monitored wavelengths are shown in Figure S7).

Figure 5 Excitation (blue line, λmon = 616 nm) and emission
spectra (red line, λex = 315 nm) of (a) [1-EuL],
(b) [1-EuL-bdc], (c) [3-EuL], and (d) [5-EuL] films.

Under UV excitation (λex = 315 nm), pure
Tb films showed a green emission characteristic of the Tb ion (Figure 6). The emission spectra
of the Tb films were composed of four bands at 488, 542, 583, and
620 nm assigned to the f–f transitions 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 7F4, and 5D4 → 7F3 transitions, respectively. No differences in the band
position or in the spectra shape were observed between the Tb films
due to similar Tb complex composition. As previously observed for
Eu films, the emission spectra of the Tb films were slightly different
from those of the TbL complex in the solid state51 and comparable to those observed for the TbL coordination
polymers, indicating a similar structure of the Tb complex in the
film and the coordination polymer.50

Figure 6 Excitation
(blue line, λmon = 542 nm) and emission spectra (green
line, λex = 315 nm) of (a) [1-TbL], (b) [1-TbL-bdc],
(c) [3-TbL], and (d) [5-TbL] films.

Excitation spectra of the TbL films exhibited the same broadband
between 300 and 350 nm as the ligand absorption (other wavelengths
monitored are included in the Figure S8). Again, this observation confirmed that the emission of Tb was
only induced by an energy transfer between the ligand and the Tb ion.

The mixed films [4-EuL-5Tb/EuL] and [4-TbL-5Tb/EuL] showed luminescence
under UV excitation (Figure 7). Their emission spectra were similar and composed of seven
bands from Eu and Tb ion emissions. The bands at 579, 590, 616, 649,
and 685 nm were attributed to the Eu f–f, 5D0 → 7F0, 4D0 → 7F1, 4D0 → 7F2, 4D0 → 7F3, and 4D0 → 7F4 transitions, respectively. The two other bands at 488
and 542 nm were attributed to the Tb transition, 5D4 → 7F6 and 5D4 → 7F5; the other Tb transitions 5D4 → 7F4 and 5D4 → 7F3 being confused
within the Eu f–f transitions. As observed in the spectra,
the Tb emission was more intense in the [4-TbL-5-Tb/EuL] film than
in the [4-EuL-5-Tb/EuL] film due to the difference in the Tb composition
in the films. Nevertheless, the Eu emission was more intense than
the Tb emission even when the Eu ion was in lower proportion as in
the [4-TbL-5-Tb/EuL] film.

Figure 7 Excitation spectra (blue line, λmon = 616 nm) and emission spectra (orange line, λex = 315 nm) of (a) [4-TbL-5-Tb/EuL] and (b) [4-EuL-5-Tb/EuL] films.

Excitation spectra of mixed films were analogous
to those of the previously described pure films and corresponded to
the absorption spectra of the ligand (all wavelength monitored are
included in SI (Figures S9 and S10)). Again,
this band confirmed the energy transfer between the ligand and the
lanthanide ions.

Luminescence Lifetime and Quantum Yield
Absolute luminescence quantum yields QLnL and luminescence
lifetimes τobs of the films were measured at room
temperature. The values are estimated and given in Table 1, Figures S11 and S12.

The emission decay curves of pure EuL films can be
divided into three components, indicating that three Eu sites with
different symmetries coexisted in the films. The [1-EuL] film had
the best luminescent properties with a global lifetime evaluated at
0.6 ms and the Eu f–f emission efficiency calculated at 4.3%.
If no difference was observed in the Eu lifetime composition by increasing
the generation number, the addition of the bdc spacer reduced the
global lifetime to 0.18 ms and the quantum yield to 1.1%. This lifetime
diminution is possibly due to the reduction of the energy transfer
efficiency between the ligand and the Eu ions. In the [3-EuL] film,
the addition of two generations of complexes increased the lifetime
and the quantum yield to 0.3 ms and 1.4%, respectively. Then, the
continued expansion of the film affected neither the lifetime nor
the quantum yield. The luminescent properties of the [5-EuL] film
were similar to the luminescent properties of the [3-EuL] film.

The luminescent properties of the Tb films were different from the
properties observed for the Eu films (Table 1). The Tb emission can be divided into four
components, indicating than four different symmetries of Tb ions coexisted
in the films. The [1-TbL] films had a luminescent lifetime of 0.04
ms and a quantum yield lower than 1%, which are inferior to the properties
of the [1-EuL] film. As observed in the solid state51 and in the coordination polymer,50 TbL showed weaker luminescent properties than EuL, which could be
explained by a back-energy transfer between Tb ions and the organic
ligands.52−54 Again, the increase of the generations did not affect
the Tb lifetime composition but did affect the lifetime and emission
efficiency. In the [1-TbL-bdc] film, the addition of bdc enhanced
the global lifetime by 0.06 ms and the quantum yield by 1.5%. As opposed
to Eu film, this improvement in luminescence properties could be explained
by an increase of the energy transfer efficiency due to the coordination
of the bdc linker. In [3-TbL], the expansion of two generations of
TbL induced a reduction of the lifetime by 0.05 ms and of the quantum
yield by 1%. As observed for EuL films, the continued growth of the
film had no effect on the luminescent properties; similar luminescence
properties were observed for [5-TbL] and [3-TbL] films.

As mentioned
above, the luminescence properties cannot be improved after the third-generation
Ln complex. Several studies have shown that Eu emission can be increased
with an energy transfer from Tb ion.55−58 For this purpose, mixed films
[4-EuL-5-Tb/EuL] and [4-TbL-5-Tb/EuL] were prepared. The mixing of
Eu and Tb ions in the last generation induced an improvement of the
Eu f–f emission (Table 1). From the decay curves (Figure S13), the Eu emission was still composed of three components, but the
luminescence lifetime reached a value of 0.66 and 0.86 ms for [4-EuL-5-Tb/EuL]
and [4-TbL-5-Tb/EuL], respectively, and the luminescence efficiency
was evaluated at 4.1 and 2.4%, respectively. The adding Tb ions to
the fifth-generation Ln complex allowed to increase the luminescence
of the Eu ion to some values superior to the values observed for the
pure film [5-EuL] and confirmed the occurrence of an energy transfer
between Tb and Eu ions. The through-space energy-transfer efficiency
(η) can be estimated by the following equation:  where τ is the Tb
lifetime in mixed films and τ0 is the lifetime in
pure [5-TbL] film.57 The energy-transfer
efficiency from Tb to Eu was calculated to be 80 and 40% in [4-EuL-5-Tb/EuL]
and [4-TbL-5-Tb/EuL] films, respectively, using the above equation.
Additionally, the quantum yield of Tb ion cannot be detected in these
films, demonstrating the occurrence of the energy transfer from Tb
to Eu ions.

Structure of Lanthanide-Oligomeric Films
An efficient energy transfer is induced by the short distance between
Eu and Tb ions. As mentioned previously, in the solid state, the Tb
and Eu ions of the chain-structured complex were too far in the mixed
polymer to induce an energy transfer.50 Optical waveguide spectroscopy of the [1-EuL] (Figure 8a) and [3-EuL] films (Figure 8b) was performed
to study the structure and disposition of the lanthanide oligomers
into the films. The bands in this wavelength region are assigned to
the π–π* transitions localized on the coordinating
ligand moiety, L. Dp and Ds are the polarized absorption spectra observed with polarized
light, with polarizer angles in the perpendicular and horizontal directions,
respectively. The maximum absorbance in [1-EuL] of Dp and Ds differs from each
other, meaning that the π-electric systems obviously exists
with a tilt angle. Furthermore, the polarized absorption bands of
[3-EuL] appear at the corresponding positions than in [1-EuL] but
with different absorbance, suggesting that the oligomers have no perpendicular
growth on the quartz surface.

Figure 8 Optical waveguide spectroscopy of [1-EuL] (a)
and [3-EuL] (b) films. Complex orientation into films [1-EuL] (c)
and [3-EuL] (d). α was estimated from the equations in the SI.

From the optical waveguide
spectra, the average orientation angle of the complex into the films
was calculated (Figure 8c,d, equations are given in Figure S14).59,60 In the [1-EuL] film, the average angle of
the complex with the z-axis was about 80°. By
increasing the number of generations, the average angle decreased
to 68°, demonstrating that the complexes became more tilted.
From there, the arrangement of the oligomers into the film can be
supposed. From the carboxylate SAM’s quartz, the oligomers
grow perpendicularly and bent with the increasing generation number,
forming a domelike structure. The oligomers of the fifth generation
could be arranged in two possible fashions, finishing by the blooming
or tightening of the complexes (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Possible domelike packing structure of the LnL oligomers
into the films: (a) blooming arrangement and (b) tightening arrangement.

These structures were confirmed by synchrotron
X-ray diffraction using an attachment for small angle.36 X-ray diffraction patterns of oligomers showed
one broadband between 10 and 25° (Figure S15).61,62 It assimilated to the disorder
caused by the bending of the oligomers and the change in the orientation
of the complexes with the growth of the film.

As previously
mentioned, the luminescent properties of mixed films showed an efficient
energy transfer between Tb and Eu ions. This energy transfer follows
a Förster-type mechanism, which is directly dependent on the
distance between the two lanthanide ions (dmax ≈ 10 Å).58 Here, the presence
of an efficient energy transfer because of the short distance between
Tb and Eu ions is more accurate in the tightening arrangement (Figure 8b).

Conclusions
A series of new lanthanide-oligomeric brush films composed of small
oligomers of EuL or TbL were prepared using the LbL method and bcd
as a spacer. Preparation and composition of the films were studied
by AFM and XPS. All films showed a f–f emission from Eu or
Tb ions through an energy transfer from the organic ligand. Analysis
of the luminescent properties showed the modification of the luminescent
properties until the third generation; no effect on the luminescence
properties were observed after the third generation. By mixing Eu
and Tb ions, the mixed films [4-EuL-5-Eu/TbL] and [4-TbL-5-Eu/TbL]
demonstrated an increase of the Eu luminescence properties caused
by an efficient energy transfer between Tb and Eu ions. This property
was associated to the optical waveguide spectroscopy and synchrotron
X-ray diffraction of the fifth-generation films to conclude that the
oligomers are packed in a domelike structure, finishing by the tightening
of the complexes in the last layer.

Materials and Methods
Functionalization
of Quartz Substrates and Complexes Synthesis
The carboxylate
SAM’s quartz63,64 and lanthanides complexes51 were synthesized from an adapted procedure reported
previously (more details of the process are given in the SI).

Carboxylate SAM’s Quartz Preparation
Quartz plate was dipped, under sonication, in a mixture of HCl
and methanol (1:1) for 30 min and then in H2SO4 (6 N) aqueous solution for 1 h. Fresh hydrolyzed quartz plates were
dipped in a solution of 3-aminopro-pyltrihydroxysilane (0.1 M in ethanol)
and heated at 60 °C for 3.5 h. Followed by immersion for 9 h,
in glutaric anhydride solution (0.3 M in dimethylformamide) at room
temperature. Finally, the quartz plate was dipped in an aqueous solution
of NaOH (0.01 M) for 2 h and rinsed with ultrapure water. Carboxylate
SAM’s quartz was then dried with N2 to remove all
physisorbed impurities.

Synthesis of Hexadentate Ligand51
The hexadentate ligand was prepared
by the addition of ethylenediamine (0.26 mL, 3.91 mmol, 0.5 equiv)
in a solution of bipyridine-6-aldehyde (1.45 g, 7.87 mmol, 1 equiv)
in methanol (5 mL). After 30 min, the precipitate was filtrated and
recrystallized with methanol to yield the pure compound as a white
solid (1.03 g, 2.62 mmol, 67%).

General Procedure for Complex
Synthesis
In a solution of the hexadentate ligand (100 mg,
0.25 mmol, 1 equiv) in methanol (60 mL) was added Ln3+·6H2O (0.25 mmol, 1 equiv). After 30 min, NH4PF6 (41.5 mg, 0.25 mmol, 1 equiv) was added and the reaction
mixture was stirred for another 3 h. The white precipitate was filtrated
and washed with cold methanol to yield the Ln complex as a white solid.

Lanthanide Film Preparation
Freshly prepared carboxylate
SAM’s quartz substrate was cyclically dipped in LnL (Ln = Eu
or Tb) solution (1 × 10–3 M + 1 equiv of Et3N in acetonitrile) and in bdc solution (1 × 10–3 M + 2 equiv of Et3N in ethanol). Each immersion step
was intercalated with several rinses and sonication for 5 min in a
spectroscopic grade solvent. Then, the films were dried with N2 gas to remove the maximum physisorbed impurities. [1-LnL],
[3-LnL], and [5-LnL] films were obtained after 1, 3, and 5 cycles,
respectively. The preparation of mixed lanthanide films [4-EuL-5Tb/EuL]
and [4-TbL-5Tb/EuL] followed a similar process. The four first-generation
films were prepared with a pure LnL solution (Eu or Tb) as previously
described. A fifth layer on [4-EuL] or [4-TbL] was prepared with an
equimolar solution of EuL and TbL complexes (1 × 10–3 M + 1 equiv of Et3N in acetonitrile).

Apparatus
Contact angles were observed with CA-X (Kyowa Interface Science
Co. Ltd.). Synchrotron XRPD patterns were recorded on a large Debye–Scherrer
camera installed at SPring-8 BL02B2 (JASRI/SPring-8) using an imaging
plate as a detector. Atomic force microscope SPM-8100FM (Shimadzu)
was used for the measurements of FM-AFM. Electronic absorption spectra
in the solid state were observed from the diffused reflection method
with the conversion of the y-axis by UV-3600 (Shimadzu).
Polarized electronic absorption spectra using an optical waveguide
system was obtained using a modified SIS-5100 attached with a Glan–Taylor
polarizer prism (System Instruments Co.). Luminescence and excitation
spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog 3-22 (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Absolute
luminescence quantum yields and luminescence lifetimes were determined
using an absolute luminescence quantum yield C9920-02 spectrometer
