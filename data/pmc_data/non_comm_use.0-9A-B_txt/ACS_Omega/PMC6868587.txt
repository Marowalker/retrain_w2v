Changing functionalities of materials
using simple methods is an
active area of research, as it is “green” and lowers
the developing cost of new products for the enterprises. A new small
molecule racemic N,N-dimethyl aspartic
acid has been prepared. Its structure is determined by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction. It is characterized by FTIR, XPS, 1H
NMR, and mass spectroscopy. Its near-infrared luminescence can be
enhanced by the combination of metal ions, including Dy3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Sr3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, and Sm3+ ions. An optical chemistry mechanism upon interaction
between the sensitizer and activator is proposed. Furthermore, the
association of Ca2+, Sr2+, or Zr4+ ions to the molecule enhanced its photodegradation for dyes under
white-light irradiation. Specifically, rhodamine 6G can be degraded
by the Ca2+-modified molecule; rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G,
and fluorescein sodium salt can be degraded by the Sr2+- or Zr4+-modified molecule. This surprising development
opens a way in simultaneously increasing NIR luminescence and the
ability of dye photodegradation for the investigated molecule.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The development of materials with multifunctionalities is important,
which can be used to fulfill different tasks and therefore lower the
cost for the enterprises.

One type of functionality we are interested
in for the materials
is the near-infrared (NIR) emission. Indeed, synthesis of materials
with photoluminescence in the NIR window (750–1100 nm) has
been an active area of research given that their application in biomedical
imaging within this region is superior to the ultraviolet–visible
range.1−5 Much improvement in imaging quality can be achieved due to low levels
of tissue autofluorescence, diminished photon scattering, and reduced
photon absorption. Several materials systems have been reported to
show NIR fluorescence, including semiconductor quantum dots,6,7 metal organic complexes,8 small molecule
dyes,9 polymers,10 carbon nanotubes,11 metal clusters,12 and inorganic nanoparticles.13−19

One challenge that is associated with the application of NIR
fluorophores
would be the optimization of the luminescence. Suppose that we have
synthesized one NIR fluorophore, can we further increase the NIR fluorescence
intensity or shift the center wavelength using some facile methods?
This is extremely useful in practical clinic or industry applications
where the access to the chemical hood and chemical reactors is limited.
Simple and cost-effective ways for modification of the optical properties
of the fluorophores are in great demand. One possible way is using
the metal ions to process the synthesized NIR fluorophore. Given that
the metal ions have rich energy levels, the optical properties of
the materials may be particularly tuned by incorporation of NIR-emissive
metal sites such as Er3+, Nd3+, Y3+, La3+, Pr3+, Gd3+, Dy3+, and Yb3+.20−27

Another type of functionality in the materials we are looking
for
is dye degradation. Dyes are extensively used in textile plants for
coloring clothes. The dyes that are discharged into the rivers can
seriously harm a lot of birds and animals. The dyes create an unsafe
environment for them due to their toxicity. Dye molecules generally
contain complex aromatic molecular structures that make them more
stable and more difficult to biodegrade. It is critical to perform
the dye pretreatment for the wastewater as these dye materials would
end up in our drinking water if the wastewater is not treated properly.
The dyes can be decomposed via photodegradation. Especially, white-light-
or solar-light-assisted photodegradation for organic pollutants is
considered to be a green technology.

Aspartic acid is an α-amino
acid that is used in the biosynthesis
of proteins. It is industrially made by fermentative or enzymatic
batch process from fumaric acid and ammonia, using aspartase as the
enzyme.28l/d-Aspartate
(the ionic form of aspartic acid) is reported to be present in the
human brain.29

It is rarely reported
that aspartic acid and its derivatives are
chemically synthesized without using the aspartase enzyme. No reports
about them have shown NIR fluorescence as well as dye-photodegradation
effects.

Herein, we first report chemical synthesis of a new
type of aspartic
acid single crystal: racemic N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid (compound 1). The scheme is
shown in Scheme 1.
Here, fumaric acid is utilized as one of the raw materials for making
compound 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of Racemic N,N-Dimethyl
Aspartic Acid
Compound 1 was characterized by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 1H
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy.

Compound 1 shows NIR fluorescence in the range of
800–1100 nm when it is excited by 785 nm light. It can be modified
by the metal ions to increase the fluorescence intensity as well as
to shift the peak wavelength. Its NIR photoluminescence corresponding
to the 785 nm light excitation can be tuned by combination of different
metal ions, including Dy3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Sr2+, Tl3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, Sm3+, Ag+, Ce4+, Cr3+, Cs+, In+, Li+, Mo6+, Na+, Ni3+, and Rb+ ions. The introduction of Dy3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Sr2+, Tl3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, and Sm3+ to the molecule leads
to an enhanced NIR photoluminescence band centered around 813 nm.
Furthermore, the introduction of Nd3+ to this molecule
leads to intensified NIR photoluminescence bands at 812.36, 868.86,
888.31, 1014.14, and 1055.68 nm.

Additionally, metal-ion modification
of the studied molecule leads
to the enhanced dye photodegradation. Here, Ca2+-modified N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid (compound 2) can be used for photodegradation of rhodamine 6G under
white-light irradiation. Both Zr4+-modified N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid (compound 3) and Sr2+-modified N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid (compound 4) can be applied
for photodegradation of rhodamine 6G, rhodamine B, and fluorescein
sodium salt under white-light irradiation.

The significance
of the metal-ion modification for compound 1 is supported
by the enhancement of the NIR fluorescence
and dye photodegradation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Single-crystal X-ray
diffraction indicated that compound 1 crystallizes in
the space group P21/c. As depicted
in Figure 1, its structure
is similar to l-aspartic acid, but
with two methyl groups on the N atom. It exists in the solid state
as a zwitterion, with one H atom transferring from COOH to the N atom.
The lattice parameters are described in Table 1.

the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s, which reveal two peaks at
531.21 and 532.57 eV. They correspond to the −C–O–
and −C–O–H– bonding, respectively. For
C 1s XPS spectra (Figure 2b), three peaks at 284.04, 285.19, and 288.05 eV are observed,
which are attributed to −C–C–, −O–C–O–,
and −C–H–N–. N 1s XPS spectra present
two peaks at 399.43 and 401.19 eV (Figure 2c). The 399.43 eV peak is considered to be
due to −H–N– bonding, while the 401.19 eV peak
is related to −C–N– bonding.30−32

Figure 2 High-resolution XPS spectra:

2362.47, 2746.78, 2848.47, 2926.31, 2998.55, and 3118.47 cm–1. The 676.56 cm–1 peak is assigned to C–O–O–H
in-plane bending. The 904.48 cm–1 peak is assigned
to C–C stretching. The 958.48 cm–1 peak is
considered as −O–H– out-of-plane bending. The
1030.72 and 1060.87 cm–1 peaks are due to −C–N–
stretching. The 1180.79 cm–1 peak is considered
to be due to N–H rocking. The 1307.02 cm–1 peak is assigned to −CH2– wagging. The
1372.95 cm–1 peak is related to −CH–
in-plane bending. The 1456.40 and 1606.48 cm–1 peaks
are attributed to −COO– stretching. The 1708.87 cm–1 peak corresponds to C–O– stretching.
The 1888.40, 2362.47, 2746.78, and 2848.47 cm–1 peaks
are attributed to the combinational effect of C–O stretching,
C–H stretching, C–C stretching, NH in-plane bending,
and OH in-plane bending. The 2926.31 cm–1 peak is
assigned to −CH2– stretching. The 2998.55
cm–1 peak is related to −OH– stretching.
The 3001 cm–1 peak is attributed to C–H stretching.
The 3118.47 cm–1 peak is due to N–H stretching.33

2.3 Optical Properties
The optical properties
of compound 1 are studied. Its absorption presents peaks
at 746.4, 877.64, and 980.73 nm (Figure 4a). The peaks at 746.4 and 877.64 nm are
weak, while the 980.73 nm peak is strong.

Figure 4 (a) Optical absorption
of compound 1. (b) Fluorescence
spectra show white-to-green light transition when the excitation light
varies between 280 and 360 nm. Polychromatic fluorescence spectra
are shown when excited by light sources with various wavelengths:
(c) 440 nm; (d) 540 nm; (e) 610 nm; (f) 785 nm.

Figure 4b shows
the fluorescence spectra excited by 280, 310, 320, 340, 350, and 360
nm. When the sample is excited by 280, 310, and 320 nm light, the
fluorescence shows two peaks at 383 and 523 nm, separately. When it
is excited by 340 nm light, only the 523 nm peak survives. Green-light
emission is observed. When it is excited by 350 and 360 nm, the green-light
emission is enhanced. Figure 4c presents a fluorescence peak at 531.77 nm when it is excited
by 440 nm light. When it is excited by 540 nm light, the fluorescence
spectra present a peak at 617.73 nm and a shoulder around 708 nm (Figure 4d). When it is excited
by 610 nm light, the fluorescence spectra reveal two peaks at 670
and 720 nm (Figure 4e). When it is excited by 785 nm light, the emission at 813.18 nm
is observed.

2.4 Enhancement of NIR Fluorescence
NIR
fluorescence spectra of compound 1 modified with Dy3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Sr2+, Tl 3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, Sm3+, Ag+, Ce4+, Cr3+, Cs+, In+, Li+, Mo6+, Na+, Ni3+, and Rb+ ions have been obtained using a 785 nm diode, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The excitation light was not intensively
focused on the samples since the samples may decompose upon large
excitation density. Figure 5a depicts the NIR fluorescence of compound 1 modified
by Nd3+, Gd3+, and Dy3+ ions. The
sample of compound 1 before metal-ion modification only
shows a peak at 813.18 nm whose intensity is considered as I0. Surprisingly, the sample that was modified
by Nd3+ ions shows several bands at 812.36, 868.86, 888.31,
1014.14, and 1055.68 nm. The 868.86 nm peak shows the highest intensity
whose intensity is 2 times greater than I0. The Gd3+-ion-modified sample shows a peak at 811.25
nm whose intensity is 4.67 times greater than I0. It also shows a weak peak at 1013.55 nm. The Dy3+-ion-modified sample depicts two strong peaks at 800.69 and 816.76
nm and a weak peak at 1014.14 nm. The intensity of the 816.76 nm peak
is 1.38 times greater than I0.

Figure 5 Near-infrared
fluorescence of compound 1 could be
enhanced by modification with various metal ions: (a) Dy3+, Gd3+, and Nd3+; (b) Er3+, Sr2+, and Tl3+; (c) Y3+, Zn2+, and Zr4+; (d) Ho3+ and Yb3+; (e)
La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, and Sm3+. Here, “Control” is the fluorescence spectra of compound 1 without using any metal-ion modification.

Figure 6 Impact of modification by various metal ions for near-infrared
fluorescence of compound 1 is examined: (a) Ag+, Ce4+, Cr3+, and Cs+; (b) In+, Li+, and Mo6+; (c) Na+,
Ni3+, and Rb+. Here, “Control”
is its fluorescence spectra without using any metal-ion modification.

Figure 5b–e
plots the fluorescence spectra of the samples modified by Er3+, Sr2+, Tl3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, and Sm3+ ions. They
show a profile similar to that of the Gd3+-ion-modified
sample. They all present a peak around 810–813 nm whose intensity
is 0.8–2.8 times higher than I0.

The samples modified by Ce4+, Cr3+,
Cs+, In+, Li+, Mo6+, Na+, Ni3+, and Rb+ ions all show a fluorescence
peak whose intensity is comparable to I0 (Figure 6a–c).
The sample modified by Ag+ ions shows a suppressed fluorescence
profile (Figure 6a).
The results prove that Ag+, Ce4+, Cr3+, Cs+, In+, Li+, Mo6+, Na+, Ni3+, and Rb+ ions are not
good for the modification of compound 1 in order to enhance
the NIR fluorescence.

An optical chemistry mechanism is proposed
to explain the NIR fluorescence
of Nd3+-ion-modified compound 1 (see Figure 7). It depicts the
energy level transitions of Nd3+-ion-modified compound 1 under 785 nm light excitation. In this diagram, it is supposed
that the −O–C–N– group in compound 1 is excited via absorbing excitation photons. The excited
−O–C–N– group is utilized as a sensitizer
for the Nd3+ activators. This results in energy transfer
from the −O–C–N– group to the Nd3+ ion. As a result, the emission is forced to be generated. The energy
transfer process is described in Figure 7, which results in the emission light of
812.36 (energy level transition happens from 2H11/2 to 4I13/2), 868.86 (2P1/2 to 4F3/2), 888.31 (2G7/2 to 4I15/2), 1014.14 (4F5/2 to 4I11/2), 1055.68 nm (4F3/2 to 4I11/2).36 The optical chemistry of compound 1 modified by other
ions under 785 nm light excitation is similar. The −O–C–N–
group works as a sensitizer for the specific metal ion (i.e., Dy3+, Gd3+, Er3+, Sr2+, Tl3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, Sm3+, Ag+, Ce4+, Cr3+, Cs+, In+, Li+, Mo6+, Na+, Ni3+, and Rb+ ions)
activators. The only difference is the emission light and the associated
energy level transitions corresponding to the metal ions. The general
structure of a laser contains a pumping source, gain medium, and mirrors.
While the pumping source and mirrors are commercially available, the
gain medium is not always conveniently accessible. The gain medium
is the most important factor of the laser as it determines the operation
wavelength and optical properties of the laser. Here, single crystals
of compound 1 were successfully made. It shows interestingly
polychromatic photoluminescence covering an ultrawide range of UV–vis–NIR
optical windows. It can be selected as the gain medium to make the
laser in specific optical windows. More importantly, it shows NIR
fluorescence around 800–1100 nm. The NIR fluorescence intensity
can be enhanced, and the emitting wavelength can be shifted when the
modification using various metal ions is applied. It indicates that
this small molecule can be flexibly utilized as the gain medium for
making NIR luminescence lasers covering from 800 to 1100 nm range.
It can be conveniently done via commercial pumping sources such as
785 nm LDs.

2.5 Enhancement of Dye Photodegradation via Metal-Ion
Modification
Figure 8 compares discoloration of the dyes by using compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4. a1,
a2, and a3 are the vials filled with rhodamine B (RB), rhodamine 6G
(R6G), and fluorescein sodium salt (FSS) before the discoloration
test. Compound 1 was then utilized for running the dye-photodegradation
test. b1, b2, and b3 are the vials filled with RB, R6G, and FSS after
the discoloration test. It should be noted that the colors of b1,
b2, and b3 are almost the same as those of a1, a2, and a3, which indicates
that the use of compound 1 is not effective for the photodegradation
of RB, R6G, and FSS.

Figure 8 Discoloration of the dyes using photodegradation under
white-light
irradiation. a1, a2, and a3 are the vials filled with RB, R6G, and
FSS before the photodegradation test. b1, b2, and b3 are the vials
filled with RB, R6G, and FSS after the photodegradation test via using
compound 1. c1, c2, and c3 are the vials filled with
R6G after photodegradation tests for 30, 60, and 80 min via using
compound 2. d1, d2, and d3 are the vials filled with
RB after photodegradation tests for 20, 40, and 60 min via using compound 3. d4, d5, and d6 are the vials filled with R6G after photodegradation
tests for 20, 40, and 60 min via compound 3. d7, d8,
and d9 are the vials filled with FSS after photodegradation tests
for 20, 40, and 60 min via compound 3. e1, e2, and e3
are the vials filled with RB after photodegradation tests for 20,
40, and 80 min via compound 4. e4, e5, and e6 are the
vials filled with R6G after photodegradation tests for 20, 40, and
80 min via using compound 4. e7, e8, and e9 are the vials
filled with FSS after photodegradation tests for 20, 40, and 80 min
via using compound 4.

Compound 2 was used for the photodegradation test
of R6G. c1, c2, and c3 are the vials filled with R6G after it was
carried out with irradiation times of 30, 60, and 80 min. Its color
was changed from dark blue to dark yellow after the photodegradation
test was completed. When compound 1 was used, the color
of R6G was not removed. However, R6G was found to be decolored by
compound 2. Therefore, it suggests that the introduction
of Ca2+ ions enhances the ability of R6G photodegradation
for the investigated molecule, N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid. Compounds 3 and 4 were tested for the photodegradation of RB, R6G, and FSS. d1, d2,
and d3 are the vials filled with RB after the photodegradation is
run for 20, 40, and 60 min via using compound 3. d4,
d5, and d6 are the vials filled with R6G after the photodegradation
is run for 20, 40, and 60 min via using compound 3. d7,
d8, and d9 are the vials filled with FFS after the photodegradation
is performed for 20, 40, and 60 min via using compound 3. e1, e2, and e3 are the vials filled with RB after the photodegradation
test is conducted for 20, 40, and 80 min via using compound 4. e4, e5, and e6 are the vials filled with R6G after the
photodegradation test is run for 20, 40, and 80 min via using compound 4. e7, e8, and e9 are the vials filled with FSS after the
photodegradation is performed for 20, 40, and 80 min via using compound 4. The color of RB, R6G, or FSS was successfully removed by
using compound 3 or 4. It indicates that
the introduction of Zr4+ or Sr2+ ions to the
molecule leads to the degradation of RB, R6G, and FSS.

The absorption
and fluorescence spectra were studied for the impact
of compounds 2, 3, and 4 on
dye photodegradation. The absorption spectral results are shown in Figures S1–S3. The fluorescence spectral
analysis is shown as follows.

Figure 9a,b shows
the fluorescence spectra corresponding to the photodegradation via
compound 2. Figure 9a shows fluorescence of pristine R6G, which presents
a 573 nm peak upon 523 nm light excitation. Figure 9b reveals the fluorescence spectra of R6G
after photodegradation processing of using compound 2 conducted in 30, 60, and 80 min. They all present a shoulder around
570–750 nm. The 573 nm peak disappears, which suggests the
degradation of R6G.

time
under white-light irradiation for R6G after photodegradation test
via compound 2. (a) Fluorescence spectra of R6G before
photodegradation test. (b) Fluorescence spectral study of the influence
of irradiation time. Here, the excitation wavelength is 523 nm.

Figure 10a presents
the fluorescence spectra of RB before and after the photodegradation
experiment of using compound 3 (the excitation wavelength
is 480 nm). For pristine RB, it shows a 600 nm peak (the pink curve
in Figure 10a). After
the test is run for 20 min, the fluorescence spectra show a peak at
557 nm. After the photodegradation test is conducted for 40 min, a
sharp peak centered at 560 nm appears. After the photodegradation
test is performed for 60 min, it shows a small peak around 542 nm.

time for photodegradation of FSS (excitation wavelength is 440 nm).

Figure 10b presents
the fluorescence of R6G after the photodegradation test through compound 3. The characteristic 573 nm peak of R6G (as indicated in Figure 9a) is absent in the
fluorescence spectra, which means that R6G has been degraded after
photodegradation processing is done after 20, 40, and 80 min. The
fluorescence spectra for FSS photodegradation with respect to different
times are shown in Figure 10c. The fluorescence of pristine FSS shows a characteristic
peak at 524 nm when excited by 440 nm light (pink curve in Figure 10c). This peak is
absent in the fluorescence spectra after the photodegradation test
is run for 20, 40, and 80 min, which suggests the degradation of FSS.

The fluorescence spectra corresponding to the photodegradation
test via compound 4 are revealed in Figure 11a–c.

wavelength is 523 nm). (c) Fluorescence spectral study of the influence
of irradiation time for photodegradation of FSS (excitation wavelength
is 440 nm).

Figure 11a is the
fluorescence spectra of RB excited by 480 nm light before and after
the photodegradation test. For pristine RB, it shows a characteristic
600 nm peak (the pink curve in Figure 11a). After the photodegradation test via
compound 4 is run for 20 min, the fluorescence spectra
show a peak at 578 nm. After the photodegradation experiment is run
for 40 min, a peak at 557 nm appears. After the photodegradation test
is run for 80 min, it shows a peak around 556 nm.

The characteristic
573 nm peak of R6G is absent in the fluorescence
spectra when the sample is excited by 523 nm light (see Figure 11b). It indicates
the degradation of R6G.

The fluorescence spectra for FSS photodegradation
are shown in Figure 11c. The fluorescence
of pristine FSS shows a characteristic peak at 524 nm when excited
by 440 nm light (see the cyan curve in Figure 11c). This peak is found to be absent in the
fluorescence spectra after the photodegradation test is run for 20,
40, and 60 min. This suggests the degradation of FSS.

2.6 Mechanism of the Photodegradation
Ca2+-,
Zr4+-, or Sr2+-ion-modified
aspartic acid showed better photodegradation activities, likely due
to the effects of increased electron–hole recombination and
reduced material defects. The proposed mechanism for the photodegradation
of the dyes can be assumed as (reactions 1–6): under white-light
irradiation, the excited electrons and holes diffuse to the sample
surface (reaction 1)
and react with surface species. With metal-ion-modified aspartic acid
(MIMAA), the surface charges become more positive, leading to more
OH– ions adsorbed on the material surface for charge
balance. The adsorbed OH– ions can accept holes
to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH) (reaction 3). It should be noted that
the hole sites attack the adsorbed dye molecules directly (reaction 2), while ·OH radicals attack the oxygenated structure (reaction 4) to form dye fragments. Subsequently,
the dye fragments react with the active sites, including holes and ·OH radicals (reactions 5 and 6). For this reason, more
absorption sites of the n−π* transition are formed at
the initial stage due to the·OH attack. 1   2   3   4   5   6  

3 Conclusions
A new type of aspartic
acid single crystal, compound 1, has been synthesized.

The enhanced NIR photoluminescence of the neodymium ion has been
achieved from the neodymium-ion-associated compound 1 sensitized by the −O–C–N– group upon
785 nm excitation. The results suggest that it has promising applications
in neodymium-based optical materials and devices. Indirect excitation
mechanisms for the investigated Nd3+-modified compound 1 are deduced mainly to be −O–C–N–
group emission introduced energy transition from 2H11/2 to 4I13/2 (for 812.36 nm light emission), 2P1/2 to 4F3/2 (for 868.86
nm emission), 2G7/2 to 4I15/2 (for 888.31 nm emission), 4F5/2 to 4I11/2 (for 1014.14 nm light emission), and 1055.68 4F3/2 to 4I11/2 (for 1055.68
nm light emission). Further work is in progress concerning much evidence
for the optical chemistry mechanisms. Also, the intensified NIR luminescence
of the Dy3+-, Gd3+-, Nd3+-, Er3+-, Sr2+-, Tl3+-, Y3+-, Zn2+-, Zr4+-, Ho3+-, Yb3+-,
La3+-, Pr6+/Pr3+-, Sm3+-modified compound 1 pumped at 785 nm provides the possibility
to incorporate it into polymers or hybrid organic–inorganic
matrixes to fabricate the excitation medium for the NIR laser.

In addition, compound 2 (Ca2+-ion-modified
compound 1) is found to be useful for the photodegradation
of rhodamine 6G. Compounds 3 (Zr4+-modified
compound 1) and 4 (Sr2+-modified
compound 1) are good for the photodegradation of rhodamine
B, rhodamine 6G, and fluorescein sodium salt. These indicate that
metal-ion modification is a good way for increasing the ability of
dye photodegradation for the studied molecule.

This work shows
development of a new small molecule whose NIR luminescence
and ability of dye degradation can be simultaneously enhanced by the
association of metal ions.

We are currently experimenting with
modified ligands to determine
whether the aspartic acid complexes can be made reactive with other
compounds, such as CO2, through metal-ion modification;
these changes are designed to develop the small molecule into a robust
material system with more functionalities.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
All commercially available
reagents and solvents were bought from Alfa Aesar and used without
further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Organic
Complex Solution
Solution a was made by dissolving 2-methylimidazole
(2 g), terephthalic
acid (5 g), fumaric acid (5 g), d-(+)-glucose (5 g), oxalic
acid dihydrate (5 g), and dimethyl sulfoxide (50 mL) in deionized
water (200 mL). Solution b was prepared by mixing dimethylformamide
(300 mL), oleic acid (40 mL), triethylamine (40 mL), diethylene glycol
(40 mL), dimethyl sulfoxide (20 mL), and methacrylic anhydride (10
mL). Solution c was made by dissolving l-cysteine (2 g) in
deionized water (50 mL). Solutions a, b, and c were mixed and stirred
to get the organic complex solution.

4.3 Preparation
of Racemic N,N-Dimethyl Aspartic
Acid
Niobium(V) chloride (0.1
g), samarium chloride hydrate (0.4 g), and sodium hydroxide (0.016
g) were dissolved in deionized water (10 mL) to get solution d. Solution
d was mixed with 40 mL of organic complex solution prepared in the
previous step. The acquired solution was heated with 80 °C for
2 h. The acquired yellow-black crystals were cleaned with ethanol.
Then the crystals were recrystallized in ethanol for single-crystal
X-ray diffraction measurement.

4.4 Preparation
of Metal-Ion-Modified N,N-Dimethyl
Aspartic Acid
The
synthesized sample of racemic N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid (0.1 g) was dissolved in methanol (50 mL)
to get solution d.

Zirconium(IV) chloride (0.12 g) was first
dissolved in water (1 mL). Then the acquired Zr4+-ion solution
was added to solution d (1 mL) in a centrifuge tube, which was shaken
for 5 min to get Zr4+-ion-modified N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid.

The preparation of Ca2+-, Dy3+-, Gd3+-, Nd3+-,
Er3+-, Sr2+-, Tl3+-, Y3+-, Zn2+-, Zr4+-, Ho3+-, Yb3+-, La3+-, Pr6+/Pr3+-, Sm3+-, Ag+-, Ce4+-, Cr3+-, Cs+-, In+-, Li+-, Mo6+-, Na+-, and Ni3+-ion-modified N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid is similar to that of
Zr4+-ion-modified N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid.

4.5 Characterization and Optical
Study
The XPS study was performed by using a K-Alpha XPS
instrument (Thermo
Scientific). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement was done
through a Bruker APEX3 diffractometer. UV–vis–NIR absorption
and UV–vis fluorescence spectroscopy were collected through
a SPARK spectrometer. The FTIR spectra were collected via a Thermo
Fisher Nicolet IS 10 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer
equipped with a Smart iTR diamond ATR accessory and with a deuterated
triglycine sulfate detector. The mass spectra were collected through
an accurate mass electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer coupled
with a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Specifically,
an Agilent 1260 Infinity II quaternary liquid chromatograph coupled
to an Agilent 6230 electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer was
used for detection of analytes. NMR spectra were collected via a Bruker
AV-400 MHz spectrometer. Deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) was used as a solvent for NMR.

A commercial
SPARK spectrometer was used to collect the absorption spectra. The
fluorescence spectra corresponding to excitation light wavelengths
of 280, 310, 320, 340, 350, 360, 440, 540, and 610 nm were also collected
through the SPARK spectrometer.

For collecting NIR fluorescence,
a laser diode (center wavelength
= 785 nm, Thermal Scientific, Inc.) was used as the excitation light
source. An optical fiber bundle was used to deliver a laser power
of 20 mW. Another optical fiber bundle was moving around the sample
surface to collect the NIR fluorescence. An NIR long-pass filter was
set in front of an NIR spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Inc.) to get rid
of the excitation light. A lens was used to focus the collected fluorescence
into the inlet of the NIR spectrometer.

4.6 Photodegradation
Experiment
Fluorescein
sodium salt (0.1 g) was dissolved in deionized water (50 mL) to obtain
the solution FSS. Rhodamine 6G (0.1 g) was dissolved in ethanol (50
mL) to acquire the R6G solution. Rhodamine B (0.53 g) was dissolved
in deionized water (100 mL) to get the RB solution. Calcium chloride
(1.3 g) was mixed with water (10 mL) to get the Ca2+ solution
(solution 1). Compound 1 (0.2 g) was added to solution
1 and stirred to get solution 2. Solution 2 (1.5 mL) was mixed with
R6G (500 μL) and stirred to get solution 3. A halogen light
bulb (Model: Double Ended Quartz FCL, OSRAM) with a maximum output
optical power of 500 W was utilized for white-light irradiation. The
output optical power of the light bulb is controlled by a self-built
controller. Solution 3 was irradiated by white light for 30, 60, and
80 min. The irradiated solution 3 was taken to an optical spectrometer
for optical absorption and fluorescence measurement. The procedures
of the photodegradation of RB, R6G, and FSS through compounds 3 and 4 are similar.
