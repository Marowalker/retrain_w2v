Chirality,
universal characteristics of nature, introduces asymmetry
in synthetic materials. Revealing the microscopic asymmetry of macroscopically
symmetric materials is the key to control the growth of chiral materials
and give full play to their application potential. Materials for photon
upconversion (UC) are of great interest for many applications owing
to their anti-Stoke luminescence process, especially for chiral UC
materials. For the preparation of UC materials, a tiny change in reaction
parameters will lead to variations in morphology, phase components,
and fluorescence intensity, as well as its chirality. Because of the
strict reaction conditions for the formation of chiral UC materials,
there are no reports of the successful synthesis of chiral UC materials.
Therefore, a facile method for the controllable synthesis of chiral
UC materials is highly desired. Herein, chiral-assembled hexagonal
prisms of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals were synthesized to realize the smart manipulation
of their morphology as well as a great improvement of the fluorescence
efficiency. We proposed a three-stage doped β-NaYF4 crystal growth mechanism on mesoscale regulation, where the fluorescence
enhancement principle of chirality was revealed. The enhancement of
fluorescence efficiency of chiral UC materials endows their promising
application in luminescent displays.

Introduction
Because chirality is
a universal property of life, research on
chiral molecules and enantiomers has been continuously central in
biology, chemistry, and material science.1 Chiral compounds are mainly obtained from natural sources, asymmetric
synthesis, and racemes resolution. Asymmetric synthesis involves the
use of chiral compounds as synthetic initiators, addition of chiral
auxiliaries, and exploitation of chiral ligands. A recently reported
synthetic approach specifically attracts wide attention because of
its independence from chiral sources and is much closer to the origin
of life.2 Materials with photon upconversion
(UC) properties are of great interest for many applications as an
alternative to conventional luminescence materials because of their
narrow emission spectra, high chemical stability, and long fluorescence
lifetimes. The synthesis of UC materials with different sizes, shapes,
and phases has been widely studied.3 In
particular, there are some excellent work of hydrothermal products.
For instance, Xu et al.4 obtained uniform
high aspect ratio high purity Ca6Si6O17(OH)2 nanowires with strong photoluminescence emission
intensity by hydrothermal synthesis. Zhai et al.5 synthesized rare-earth-doped Ba5(PO4)3Cl phosphors via facile room-temperature coprecipitation
method, displaying four emission peaks under 288 nm excitation. All
of the advances in facile, green preparation methods give support
to a deeper and better studies in inorganic synthesis, such as β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals which were
studied in this article. Li and his group have conducted a series
of studies on the possible formation mechanisms for products with
various architectures, including different additives, F– sources, and pH values.6 Lin and his
partners put emphasis on the effect of pH value on the morphology
of the products and obtain the microcubic morphology with greatly
enhanced fluorescence intensity.7 In the
case of similar general rules with previous research results, we further
explore more details on specific growth mechanism of hexagonal NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals and figure
out chiral UC materials for the first time with upmost structures
which largely enhance the luminescence intensity.

NaYF4 doped with rare earth ions of Er3+ and
Yb3+ has been widely accepted as a high-efficiency UC material
to convert near-infrared (NIR) light into visible light.8 On the basis of the consensus that β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystals exhibit an order
magnitude higher efficiency than its cubic counterparts,9 we have focused on the relationship in β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystals between different
structures and their fluorescence efficiency in hydrothermal system.3a,10 In this article, we discovered chiral UC materials which have not
been reported before. Chiral β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystals were synthesized via control of the mesoscale
properties in the hydrothermal system. Generally, the growing process
of crystals involves not only microscale changes containing the integration
of atoms and molecules, the configuration of electron clouds, and
the transformation of crystal lattices, as well as macroscale evolutions
with respect to the size, shape, and phase variations of macroscopic
particles, but also the mesoscale, as has long been ignored, which
refers to the relationship between microscale and macroscale in both
time and space.11 The study of UC materials
with respect to the influence of experimental parameters on size,
shape, and phase of the products is based upon the induction of macroscopic
phenomena,3c−3f,8a whereas the current model calculations
and process simulations for crystal formation are mostly focused on
either single crystal or the whole particle.12

The absence of analysis on the mesoscale has hindered the
recognition
of the importance of multilevel and multiscale for the crystal growth
of UC materials. Mesoscale inspection and evaluation into crystal
growth were used to determine the intrinsic mechanism of the formation
of crystal morphology along with its properties. The chiral structures
were inward hexagonal prisms which are the cause of the diversity
in aspect ratio and then in fluorescence efficiency. Without using
chiral molecules, chiral structures are triggered by the left-hand
and right-hand twine of filaments, which is a response to the turbine
environment in the hydrothermal system. The spiral direction is random
but has a certain inclination such that the product obtained is not
racemic. The spiral structure is a determinant for uniform NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ samples and the combination
of particle assembly, filiform spiralism, and particle fusion determines
the ultimate lateral and longitudinal length of the products. The
concentration of the precursor is the premier experimental factor
to dominate the aspect ratio and further the fluorescence efficiency
of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals
via governing the aggregation and fusion of particles.

Results and Discussion
Effect
of Precursor Concentration
We synthesized a
series of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals with different aspect ratios by adjusting the reaction
parameters. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure 1a–c, it is
clear that an increase in the concentration of precursor solution
leads to the enlargement of aspect ratio. This is because the forming
process of hexagonal prism is dominated by vertical growth and supplemented
by horizontal growth. The higher the solution concentration, the higher
the growth rate of vertical growth. That is, the final longitudinal
growth length and aspect ratio will be increased.

Figure 1 SEM image of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ prepared with different precursor
solution concentrations: (a) 0.01
(b) 0.02, and (c) 0.04 mol/L. (d) XRD patterns of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals prepared with
different precursor solution concentrations: (i) 0.01 (ii) 0.02, and
(iii) 0.04 mol/L.

Although it is not hard
to understand that the solution concentration
affects the diffusion speed and degree of particle (including atoms,
molecules, and ions) aggregation in the hydrothermal environment,
the specific effect of solution concentration is unclear without understanding
the whole growth mechanism. All of the diffraction peaks in the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1d) of the samples can be indexed to the hexagonal (JCPDS
no. 28-1192) phase, despite the relative intensity disparity between
different lattice planes. To explore the inherent mechanism which
produces different macroscopic morphologies, we collected intermediate
products at different stages of the hydrothermal process for the precursor
solution concentration of 0.02 mol/L reaction. XRD (Figure 2e) results suggest a phase
transformation process from a pure cubic (JCPDS no. 39-0724) phase
to a mixed cubic and hexagonal phase (JCPDS no. 28-1192), and finally
to a pure hexagonal phase. We also noted that the timing of phase
transitions varied when synthesis parameters varied (Table S1). Consistent with XRD patterns, the morphology observed
by SEM images (Figure 2a–d) also exhibited three stages containing nanosphere and
hexagonal microprism shapes as well as mixed structures. We speculate
that there is a corresponding relationship between the microcosmic
phase and the macroscopic shapes that the nanospheres consist of cubic
phase crystals inside, whereas hexagonal microprisms are composed
of crystals with hexagonal phase. It is worth mentioning that the
surface of microcrystals presented a few defects at 12 h, which stayed
smooth until 3 h. In fact, the defects generated inside microcrystals
at the early stage of the reaction (the generation of defects will
be discussed); however, the growth pattern at the last stage of the
growth evolution is different from the previous process and cover
the surface of microcrystals flat. Nevertheless, after all of the
ions were exhausted during the reaction, the excess F ions started
to corrode the surface of the hexagonal microcrystals, and the parts
that were most likely to be corroded into holes were exactly where
the defects occurred in the previous stage. The control experiment
groups (samples synthesized with solution concentration of 0.01 and
0.04 mol/L) show the same pattern of surface morphology (Figure S1). In spite of the equal phase transition
mode and the equal shape evolution process, it is the assembly style
of crystalline grains into hexagonal microprisms that determines the
ultimate shape differences, which appear on the mesoscale.

Effect of pH Value of the
Precursor Solution
It has
been known previously that under the condition of a certain pH value
of the precursor solution, the higher the concentration of the precursor
solution, the greater the aspect ratio of the obtained hexagonal prism
products will be. In this section, we will explore the influence of
pH value on the morphology of the reaction products. We control for
other conditions unchanged (precursor solution concentration: 0.02
mol/L, reaction temperature: 230 °C, and reaction time: 12 h),
only when the pH of precursor solution is 3, the six prism observed
under the SEM is very thin, aspect ratio as high as 6:1, which can
be called the “six-prism bar”. The side surface of the
six-ribbed bar is smooth and flat, with “crown” at both
ends. There are a few cracks at the edge of the edge surface and occasional
small depressions on the edge surface, as shown in Figure 3a. When the pH of the precursor
solution is 5 (as is shown in Figure 3b), the six prism became shorter and thicker, with
an average aspect ratio of 1:2, obviously observed under SEM. The
side surface and two end faces of the hexagonal prism are smooth with
no cracks at the edges and a few holes on the edges. When the pH of
the precursor solution is adjusted to be neutral (pH = 7), the hexagonal
prism products become shorter, and the average aspect ratio is found
to be about 1:1 by measurement statistics. The side surface and two
end faces of the hexagonal prism are smooth with a small number of
holes at the edges, as shown in Figure 3c. When we continue to increase the pH value, we find
that under the alkaline condition, the aspect ratio of the six prisms
will further decrease, but the hexagonal microcrystals run through
each other and the agglomeration phenomenon is very serious; it is
difficult to get the product with uniform size and morphology and
good dispersion.

Figure 3 SEM image of the samples prepared at 0.02 mol/L precursor
solution
with different pH values: (a) 3, (b) 5, and (c) 7.

We find that the product morphology is not less
sensitive to the
pH value of the precursor solution than to the solution concentration.
We assume that the pH of aqueous solution mainly affects the dissociation
degree of surfactant and complex in aqueous solution and then influences
the interaction between these organic additives and cations in NaYF4, including the influence on solute diffusion, as well as
the influence on complex mode and degree.

Effect of Reaction Temperature
To explore the influence
of reaction temperature on product morphology and phase, we conducted
a control experiment by setting different reaction temperatures on
the basis of the above exploration. The above reaction exploration
was conducted at 230 °C, whereas experimental temperatures designed
in this section were 100, 130, 160, and 180 °C, respectively,
with a reaction time of 24 h. The experimental results are shown in
the SEM diagram in Figure 4. When the temperature is lower than 180 °C, even if
the reaction time is extended to 24 h, the products are still spherical.
The results show that the reaction temperature is a necessary factor
for the phase transition of the upconversion crystal, although the
influence of the reaction temperature on the product needs to be further
studied.

and (c) 160 °C. (d) XRD patterns of the samples prepared at 0.02
mol/L precursor solution and pH = 4 with different reaction temperatures.

Evolution Process of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ Microcrystals
As
illustrated in Scheme 1, we divide the entire
growth process of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals into three stages: (I) formation of hexagon-ring
base; (II) filiform growth and spiral winding; and (III) sidewall
flat, inward filling, and end capping. At the beginning of the reaction,
the cubic-phased NaYF4 grows into a nanosphere because
of the equal growth rate of each direction, and several nanospheres
tend to assemble into quasi-spherical nanoclusters to minimize surface
energy. With the increase of temperature and pressure, partial cubic-phased
NaYF4 gradually transforms to hexagonal phase, and the
nanoclusters become metastable and start to change their assembly
form because of their anisotropic crystal structures. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of hexagonal ring at the initial stage
of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystal growth
is shown in Figure 5a,b. We can clearly see the assembly and fusion trace. The fusion
sequence is deduced to be from outside to inside from the presence
of incomplete fusion particles on the inner wall of the hexagonal
ring.

Scheme 1 Possible Growth Process of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ Microcrystals
At stage II, the nanoparticles in the hexagonal
ring grow into
fibrous filaments and continue growing along (0001) direction under
the chelation of ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Figure 5c). We conjecture
that the formation of the fibrous filaments may be ascribed to the
fluid environment under high temperature and high pressure in the
autoclave. Actually, the crystal growth process is also the process
from the crystal–solution interface to the solution phase.
The nature of the interface determines the microcosmic mechanism and
the dynamic law of crystal growth. In the uniform driving force field
of crystal growth, different crystal planes grow at different growth
rates according to different dynamic laws. The growth rate of any
crystal plane is constant; therefore, the three-dimensional morphology
of crystal depends on the anisotropy of growth rate. According to
previous literatures,13 we know that the
formation of crystal whiskers (fibrous filaments) is the result of
spiral dislocation extension, one of the physical defects in crystals.
This extension is carried out by rotating a circular step surface
around the dislocation outcrop. The minimum curvature radius at the
central outcrop is equal to the radius of the critical nucleus. The
fibrous filaments sway with the flow, and the ligand EDTA forms a
complex with Ln ions and twists fibrous filaments into the strand
(compare Figures 5c
and 7a), where EDTA has guidance for the longitudinal
growth of doped β-NaYF4 crystals.

Although
the filiform growth and spiral winding is in progress,
the extra nanoparticles and ions in the hydrothermal system begin
to fill into the cavity of the filiform strands and fuse among them.
The uneven surfaces of the spiral strands provide sufficient defect
sites for ions and particles adsorption as well as fusion and hence
the adsorption process advances very fast. The nanoparticles and ions
on the outside of the crystals are adsorbed onto the surface of the
outboard of pillar sidewalls, and then they fill in the space between
each fiber of mutual helix and spackle the outer surface (stage III
of Scheme 1). The filamentous
strands are spackled up gradually until the ends are capped into flat
tops, which can be observed in the TEM image in Figure 5d–f.

Mechanism Analysis
At stage I, although the phase transition
is happening in the crystals, the atoms in the crystals are rearranged
where some of the atomic surfaces rotate and result in the changes
of close-packed structure from ABCABC to ABAB. The constraints of
the surface energy of quasi-spherical nanoclusters are thus overcome
under the significant impact of the phase field, which brings about
the decomposition of nanoclusters and rearrangement of nanoparticles.
The angles of the crystal faces of the adjacent particles change from
90° in the omnidirectional to 120° in a specific plane,
as the crystal structures change from fcc to hcp, and the particles
are aggregated into a planar hexagonal ring. Three types of assembly
principles are presented in Scheme 2, according to the lattice arrangement between adjacent
particles. Type (a), in which the crystal lattice arrays along the
same direction on each side of the hexagonal ring, is the most close-packed
array among the three types. Such a neat and symmetrical lattice arrangement
is also conducive to the continued adsorption of nanoparticles out
toward the hexagonal ring, and thus the diameter of the aggregation
in type (a) is usually larger than other aggregates. In comparison,
all of the angles between two adjacent particles’ lattice lines
are 120° in type (b), and the shell has less chance to extend
outward because of the absence of gap sites for spare nanoparticles.
The alignment in type (c) contains both 120 and 180° arrays and
is the most common aggregate form in the real hydrothermal environment.
According to the lowest energy principle, the disordered nanoparticles
after decomposition are more inclined to recombine into a relatively
low-order arrangement, namely, type (c), in contrast to type (a) and
type (b), which are single mode of arrangements. The actual base assembly
process consists of the above three self-assembly principles, and
the different proportions of three assembly principles constitute
different forms of the base structure. It is easy to grow a thicker
wall in the subsequent growth process following a type (a)-dominated
hexagon-ring base. More type (c)-contained bases are more likely to
result in defects inside microcrystals and generate a large number
of holes on the surface because of corrosion by the F ions after the
final stage. Type (b) is a limiting case of type (c), of which the
assembly proportion is normally very low in hexagonal rings. An exceptionally
high percentage of type (b) may evolve into “gray zones”
of the growth process, followed by eccentric final morphologies. These
aggregation patterns can also be reflected in many artificially designed
materials such as PbSe nanowires and nanorings, ZnO nanorods, and
CdTe nanowires.14 The assembly structures
of the hexagonal rings at stage I have an impact on the basic size
of lateral dimension for the subsequent hexagonal prisms formed at
later stages. Therefore, it is an effective way to govern the transverse
dimension of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ hexagonal prism via controlling the initial aggregation of nanoparticles
into hexagon-ring shells. For example, the precursor solution concentration,
from what we have discussed earlier, dominates the aggregation and
assembly speed of nanoparticles and thus has a direct effect on transverse
dimensions.

Rings: (a) 180° Type; (b) 120° Type; and (c) Mixed Type
Stage II is a key stage to
determine the morphology of the obtained
β-NaYF4 crystals, where the hydrothermal environment
of high temperature and high pressure and the chelation between ligands
and Ln ions play a vital role. The influence of hydrothermal environment
on the growth of β-NaYF4 crystals was analyzed on
the mesoscale regulation: different from the classical crystallization
process, which is based on atoms and molecules, the mesoscale crystallization
process of the β-NaYF4 crystal is formed by the self-assembly
and fusion of smaller particles. In the high temperature, high pressure
gas–liquid environment, the hexagon-ring bases formed at stage
I swirl in the solution and grow out fibrous filaments to flow against
the convection direction in the hydrothermal environment. A large
number of disordered nanoparticles are swirled in the solution under
the strong air flow; nevertheless, those nanoparticles in the adjacent
area of the initial hexagonal rings are adsorbed onto the fibrous
filaments and arranged in a short-ordered arrangement to achieve the
extensive growth of the fibrous filaments. Flowing in the convection,
Ln ions in the fibrous filament complex with the ligand EDTA and form
a chelate, causing the fibrous filaments to intertwine each other
into the strands, where the parallel-arranged fibrous filaments then
are fused to form smooth sidewalls in the next stage. Interestingly,
the Ln–EDTA complexes exhibit chirality, namely left and right
handedness, with Ln atoms as the center and EDTA as the side chains.
EDTA of chiral organic additive plays an indispensable role in the
producing process, whereas the hydrothermal environment plays the
role of a “catalyst”; the fluid environment under high
temperature and high pressure makes the side chain twine spirally
and the appropriate pH value regulates the combination way of EDTA
and Ln, which controls the spacial conformation of side chain, forming
a chiral structure. The strands in the same hexagonal prism show a
consistent spiral direction, whereas each prism has its unique inclination
for spiral direction as a result of different water flow zones in
the hydrothermal system. We have detected the chirality of the ultimate
products by circular dichroism (CD) and polarimetry, which confirmed
that the obtained product is not racemic. The ultimate chirality of
the whole β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystal is determined by the relative quantity between filiform
strands of left-handed and right-handed spiralism. The peak in the
CD curve (Figure 6)
shows the existence of chirality in β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystal, whereas the positive and negative
values shown via polarimetry (Table S2)
confirm the variations of chirality in the UC material. Because there
is no manual intervention in the reaction process, the appearance
of the left and right helix of the product is random; therefore, the
positive and negative polarimetry values of the whole sample are not
fixed. However, it is certain that the final products are not racemic
and present the optical activity of chirality. The chiral helix dominates
the longitudinal length of the hexagonal prism because of changes
in the helix pitch—loose spiralism leads to a larger length,
whereas tight spiralism results in a shorter aspect ratio. The selectivity
of chirality originates from the competitiveness between intrinsic
longitudinal growth and the vertical airflow and liquid flow in the
hydrothermal environment.15 The environmental
conditions take solution concentration discussed earlier as an example,
play a critical role in the spiral mode in support of ligand actions,
and thus determine the growth speed of filamentous strands.

(b) 0.02, and (c) 0.04 mol/L.

At the last stage, there are two attachment paths for particles
and ions to feed into the hexagonal miniature—sidewall (outside)
attachment and cavity attachment. As a result of the strong adsorptivity
of the cavity, the latter path proceeds much faster than the former
one. Moreover, the filamentous cavity edge at both end of the pillars
sweeps the particles and ions and suck them into the cave inside (Figure 5c). Through the contrast
experiment without EDTA, we found that EDTA plays a key role in the
cavity attachment process. As shown in Figure 7b, β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystals present hollow hexagonal
prism without capping, indicating that doped β-NaYF4 nanoparticles that are not chelated with EDTA are not easy to fuse
with the cavity. The interior space of the cavity lowers the melting
point of the chelated nanoparticles which bonds onto the inner sidewalls
with Ln ions, leading a rapid fusion into the pillar. Because the
speed of inner filling largely transcends the simultaneous filiform
growth, the cutoff point appears when the filling mass exceeds the
longitudinal length. The sidewall areas appear when the adjacent faces
meet during the spackling process and the hexagonal miniature turns
to be a hexagonal prism. The path choice may originate from element-selective
distribution, which is indicated in Figure 8 and Supporting Information Figure S2. The mapping image shows clearly that Na ions and F ions
distribute outside the hexagonal rod and constitute the exterior outline—side
areas especially, while Y ions and the doping ions fill inside the
rod. F ions with a much larger amount than Na ions gathered on the
surface of microcrystals, reflected the adsorption of excessive F
ions on the surface, and corroded into a few holes. At the same time,
it is shown indirectly that the ligand EDTA strongly couples with
Ln3+ and weakly couples with Na+, whereas there
is no link between EDTA and F–. This can be further
deduced that EDTA provides cation channels for ion filling and crystal
growth, which is in accordance with a set of comparative observations.

Furthermore, we used Raman spectroscopy to explore the intrinsic
disparity between three types of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ samples via detecting their vibration and revolution configuration
differences (Figure 9a). The β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ samples
show radical breathing mode (RBM) peaks at six Raman shifts lower
than 1000 cm–1. The relative intensity of RBM peaks
no. 4 and no. 5 of three samples varies for different aspect ratios
obtained. The peaks between 4000 and 3000 cm–1,
which are the characteristic peaks of carboxyl group, show the existence
of EDTA on the surface of the product. The Raman peaks at 474 and
498 cm–1 are the characteristic peaks for β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals, and their
relative intensity may indicate the aspect ratio of the product. It
is worth mentioning that there are substantial holes emerging at the
last stage when the holes begin to appear on the side edges and then
spread to side faces with the reaction time increasing. The number
of holes on the surface of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals synthesized in different conditions
varies significantly, which can be originated to the ratio of assembly
principle type (c)—higher proportion of type (c) produces more
inner defects in the sidewalls and thus generates more holes on the
surface as the gas escapes out.

Applications in Luminescent Displays
To explore the
relationship between fluorescence intensity and the morphology of
β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystals,
we obtain the UC luminescence spectra of samples (sample (a–c)
in Figure 1) on FL4000
fluorophotometer at room temperature in conjunction with a 980 nm
diode laser. By comparing the fluorescence spectra of as-prepared
samples, we found that the hexagonal prism with an aspect ratio close
to 1 displays much higher fluorescence strength than the slender or
squat ones (Figure 9b). The enhancement of the fluorescence efficiency can be attributed
to an appropriate compaction of spiral strands which facilitates electron
movement and electronic transition. We know that the upconversion
process depends on the migration and transition of photons and electrons.
Compared with conventional microcrystals, chiral microcrystal structure
is produced by the winding of fiber spirals, and the spacing between
the helical fibers can be used to control the light-emitting process
of upconversion. Too loose spiral mode is not conducive to the movement
and diffusion of electrons and photons and naturally is not conducive
to the upconversion luminescence. Too close spiral mode also impedes
the enhancement of fluorescence conversion efficiency. Therefore,
the winding mode with proper compactness is most effective in improving
the upconversion efficiency.

To study the applicability of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ crystals in luminescent displays,
we used high-purity epoxy resin, water-soluble curing agents, and
as-obtained β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ UC crystals to prepare some models—patterns in the poker
game. Doped β-NaYF4 crystals are added into the mixture
of epoxy resin and curing agents, and the transparency depends on
the concentration. We observed strong luminescence when the models
were placed under 980 nm NIR excitation (Figure 10). The relative fluorescence intensities
are consistent with Figure 9b. The controllable fluorescence intensity would pave the
way for the development of luminescence displays, such as fluorescent
Poker.

Conclusions
The chirality in the
β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystal
revealed the intrinsic growth mechanism assembling
from nanospheres to a hexagonal prism. The disparity among the external
morphology can be traced back to the three stages evolving during
the whole crystallization and recrystallization process. The first
stage—formation of hexagon-ring base—dominates the lateral
size of the later hexagonal prism to a large extent. The chirality
was born in the second stage—filiform growth and spiral winding—which
is just through specific assembly with achiral molecules. The last
stage—sidewall flat and end capping—plays a key role
in the longitudinal length of the hexagonal prism. We verified that
the aspect ratio of the hexagonal prism originated from chirality
and has an evident influence on the fluorescence efficiency of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals. Reaction parameters
such as the solution concentration of the precursor play a key role
in determining the aspect ratio of the products. An increase of solution
concentration leads to the rise in aspect ratio as well as the enlargement
of general size of products. The chirality is the reason for the homogeneity
of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals
and also a key determinant of the final size and aspect ratio of the
product, combined with environmental factors. We hope that the discoveries
concerning chirality not only guide the production process for the
enhancement of fluorescence efficiency but also provide a new idea
for controlling the crystallization process of inorganic metal nanomaterials.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
All of the chemical reagents were of analytical
grade and were used without further purification. RE2O3 powders (RE: Y, Yb, and Er), dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium
chloride (DDBAC), and EDTA were all purchased from Aladdin Reagent
Co., Ltd. The rare-earth oxides were dissolved in dilute hydrochloric
acid to obtain YCl3, YbCl3, and ErCl3 solutions (0.2 M).

Preparation of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ Microcrystals
In a typical procedure
for the preparation
of NaYF4:10% Yb3+,2% Er3+, the cationic
surfactant DDBAC and ligand EDTA were dissolved in 5 mL of deionized
water and then RECl3 was added to form a metal-chelating
mixed solution. NaF (12 mmol, 15 mL) solution was added dropwise into
the solution to obtain a white complex (about 40–60 drops/min),
and the mole ratio was Ln/DDBAC/EDTA/NaF = 1:1:1:12. After vigorous
stirring for 0.5 h, the white complex was transferred into a Teflon-lined
autoclave and heated at 230 °C. The holding time varies from
0.5 to 12 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature,
the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm and washed
with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the obtained
white products were freeze-dried for 24 h.

Characterization
The crystal structures, sizes, morphologies,
and elementary compositions were characterized by SEM (FEI-Sirion
200), TEM (JEM-2010F), and high-resolution TEM (JEM-2100F). The crystalline
compositions and phases of the as-prepared UC materials were characterized
by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker-AXS) using Cu
Kα radiation at 1.5418 nm at a scanning rate of 10°/min.
UC luminescence spectra of samples were obtained on FL4000 fluorophotometer
at room temperature in conjunction with a 980 nm diode laser. The
chirality property was clarified with CD (J-815) and auto polarimeter
(JASCO P-2000).
