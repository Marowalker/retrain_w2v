Coating fertilizer is an effective approach to increase
the fertilizer
use efficiency and reduce fertilizer application rate. However, only
a few studies have focused on coating phosphorus (P) fertilizer, especially
diammonium phosphate (DAP) due to its irregular shape and high specific
surface area. A novel and low-cost strategy centered on wax-based
surface modification and bio-based polymer coating was applied to
improve the nutrient characteristics of coated DAP (CDAP). Regular
DAP was modified with polyolefin wax and then coated with polyurethanes
prepared from castor oil. Experimental results indicated that wax
modification significantly decreased the specific surface area, angle
of repose of DAP particles, increased the particle hardness, and then
facilitated the formation of biopolymer-based coating. The CDAP from
wax-modified DAP had better controlled-release performance compared
with that from normal DAP. Findings from this study indicate that
wax modification can be used as an effective technology to prepare
highly efficient controlled-release P fertilizers.

==== Body
Introduction
As an essential nutrient for crops, phosphorus
(P) is a nonrenewable
resource.1 China’s available reserves
of phosphate rocks are approximately 3.7 Pg of P2O5,2,3 which has become an important strategic
resource.4 However, P use efficiency (PUE)
in agricultural soils is very low.5 Under
normal circumstances, the PUE in the current season is only 15–30%.6,7 Because of the increasing demands for P fertilizers in agriculture
and the decreasing availability of P resource, how to increase PUE
has become a research hotspot.8

Coating
fertilizers with low permeability materials is an effective
way to slow down nutrient release and thus improve the efficiency.
This technique has been used in the production of controlled-release
fertilizers.9−11 Studies have confirmed that coated phosphate fertilizer
can improve PUE and the yield of maize.12,13 Pauly14 and da Cruz15 also
proposed that coating diammonium phosphate with polymers can reduce
the contact area between P and soil to extend the release period of
P. These studies have indicated that coating phosphate fertilizers
is necessary and effective to enhance PUE in agriculture.

However,
most of the phosphate fertilizer particles (monoammonium
phosphate, calcium superphosphate, heavy calcium superphosphate, etc.)
are irregular and thus difficult to be coated with a uniform membrane.
Moreover, commercial diammonium phosphate (DAP) in the market is generally
coated with a layer of mineral oil to improve its storability, which
may affect the formation of the coating membrane. The release period
of those P fertilizers was often less than 1 month, which was below
the standard of controlled-release fertilizers.16 To solve these problems, previous studies had focused on
the improvement of coating materials, including increase of coating
material consumption, modification with nanomaterials and interpenetrating
polymer networks, etc.17−20 However, these approaches might increase the production cost, which
limited their development and commercialization.21

In addition to coating materials, the fertilizer
core also has
a great impact on the controlled-release characteristic of coated
fertilizers.22 In the preparation of coated
fertilizers, particles with a regular shape and smooth surface are
more favorable for coating. DAP has the advantages of higher water-soluble
nutrient content, more spherical form, and lower price over other
phosphate fertilizers in the market (Table S1). Nevertheless,
DAP is still not comparable to urea, which is commonly used in the
preparation of controlled-release nitrogen fertilizers.

Several
surface modification technologies had been developed to
improve the wetting, adhesion, and other physicochemical properties
through adding a variety of surface-modified agents.23 Techniques such as chemical heat treatment (nitriding,
carburizing, metallizing, etc.), surface coating (low pressure plasma
spraying, low voltage arc spraying, laser remelting composite membrane
coating, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, etc.),
and nonmetallic coating technology could enhance the roundness and
fluidity of particles, reduce the dosage of coating materials, and
improve the controlled-release characteristics. Samavini24 improved the effectiveness of P through surface
modification of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with citric acid. Bhardwaj25 improved the ability of nitrate adsorption and
sustained release by surface modification with inorganic nanomaterials.
Nevertheless, the high cost and complexity associated with these modification
technologies limited their large-scale applications.

Polyolefin
wax has been used for encapsulation due to its lubricity,
hydrophobicity, and low cost.26,27 It is a macromolecular
material with natural hydrophobicity that can effectively separate
water-soluble substances. It has the potential to improve the surface
properties of fertilizer particles, thus improving the quality of
the coating and prolonging the nutrient release period. Besides, the
wax and coating material can form a composite membrane, which could
further improve the controlled-release performance of coated diammonium
phosphate (CDAP).28 However, the application
of wax in the production of CDAP has not been reported in the literature.

The present study was aimed to develop a novel and low-cost wax
modification method to improve the smoothness of DAP particles for
easy and effective coating with bio-based polymers. The resulted controlled-release
P fertilizers were characterized with various analytical techniques.

Results and Discussion
Effects of Wax Modification on DAP Particles
Surface Morphology
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images were used to compare the surface morphology of unmodified and
wax-modified DAP particles. Many ravines and pits were seen on the
original particle surface (Figure 1A1,A2), which would cause uneven or incomplete coating
and thus require additional coating materials. These ravines and pits
could also deteriorate the controlled-release performance of the coated
fertilizers.29 After the wax modification,
the surface of the particles became much smoother (Figure 1B1–D2), which would
facilitate the formation of uniform coating films for controlled-release
fertilizers. The morphology results suggested that wax modification
of the DAP could be beneficial for the preparation and performance
of CDAP.

DAP surfaces (A2, B2, C2, D2). The image magnifications are 50×
(A1, B1, C1, D1) and 10 000× (A2, B2, C2, D2).

Particle Size Distribution and Angle of Repose
The
DAP particle size distribution of different treatments is shown in Figure 2A,B. The particle
size increased with the increase in the wax content and reached the
maximum upon WAX3 treatment. In comparison with the Control, WAX3
at the size range of 3–3.5 mm decreased, but its size range
at 4–4.5 mm increased. This result confirmed that the attachment
of wax on the DAP particle surface increased the particle size.

Figure 2 Particle size
distribution (A, B) and angle of repose (C, D) of
unmodified and wax-modified DAP. Panels (C, D) show the results at
25 and 65 °C, respectively. Each box in (C, D) includes data
for the data set; the thicker solid lines within the box were the
mean lines, and the thinner solid lines represent the medians; the
lower and upper whiskers represent upper–lower limits of data,
respectively; and the lower and upper boundaries of the boxes are
25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.

The angle of repose refers to the maximum angle
measured in a static
state when the gravity and friction force between particles are balanced
while the particles are sliding on the free incline of the accumulation
layer in the gravity field.30 Generally,
the frictions between particles reduce along with the decrease in
the angle of repose and the fluidized characters improve as well.
The repose angles of particles tested at different temperatures are
shown in Figure 2C,D.
At 25 °C, WAX1 treatment reduced the angle of repose of the particles
by 3.36% but the other two treatments showed no significant difference
(Figure 2C). However,
the fertilizer needed to be heated to 65 °C during the coating
process, so the angle of repose of the particles was measured at 65
°C. At the higher temperature, WAX2 and WAX3 treatments decreased
the angle of repose significantly, while the WAX1 treatment had no
significant effect (Figure 2D). This phenomenon should be related to the melting point
of polyolefin wax. Wax condenses into a solid at 25 °C and showed
a certain viscosity, while it melts and lubricates when heated to
65 °C. Because the coating process was at 65 °C, the melted
wax may lubricate the fertilizer particles to facilitate the formation
of polymer coatings and improve their controlled-release characteristics.

Specific Surface Area
The specific surface area of
fertilizer particles can also affect the coating process. In general,
the smaller the specific surface area is, the less the coating material
is required.31 The number of holes and
bulges on the surface of fertilizer particles can strongly affect
the specific surface area.32 Wax modification
could significantly decrease the specific surface area of the fertilizer
particles; besides, wax can fill the holes on the surface of DAP particles
(Figure 4), and then
increase the contact area between the coatings and the cores, so as
to improve their adhesion and the controlled-release characteristics.
The specific surface areas of the unmodified and wax-modified DAP
are shown in Table 1. Wax modification indeed reduced the specific surface area of DAP
by 2.34–17.11%, which would reduce the requirement of coating
materials for CDAP.

Heating Rate
The specific heat capacity of polyolefin
wax is significantly higher than that of DAP particles. As a result,
the temperature distribution of fertilizer particles and polyolefin
wax was quite different (Figure 3A–C). During the heating process, there was
no significant difference among modified and unmodified DAP as only
little wax (<0.3%) was used but the temperature of fertilizers
was significantly higher than that of wax. After heating for 20 min,
the temperature distribution of the different treatments differed
noticeably (Figure 3D–H). In the plots, different colors represent different temperatures;
the greater the color change is, the greater the temperature change
is. The temperature distribution of the Control treatment was the
most uneven, ranging from 61.7 to 67.2 °C (Figure 3D), while the temperatures of the WAX1, WAX2,
and WAX3 treatments ranged from 61.4 to 67.4 °C, 61.3 to 66.8
°C, and 60.9 to 66.8 °C, respectively (Figure 3E–H), showing a smaller
range of temperature variations. During the cooling process, the addition
of wax could also significantly slow down the cooling rate of the
fertilizer particles.28 These results indicated
that the wax coating was effective in controlling temperature, which
was mainly due to the formation of a thermal insulation wax layer
on the surface of the modified DAP particles. This insulation could
slow down the temperature decrease of the fertilizer particles to
maintain their temperature and thus reduce energy consumption.

Effects of Wax Modification on Coating Formation and Controlled-Release
Characteristics
Coating Structure
At present, the DAP particles produced
for the commercial market are mostly irregular and their rough surface
is generally not suitable for coating. Therefore, the aim of our experiment
is to improve the surface properties of DAP through wax modification
to enable the formation of the membrane coatings on the DAP surface.
As expected, the membrane of the Control treatment had uneven thickness
and rough surface (Figure 6C1), while the thickness and morphology of the WAX2 treatment
were much smoother. During coating, the rough surface of DAP particles
might cause uneven membrane formation, incomplete coating, and excessive
accumulation of coating materials in the holes (Figure 4A1,B1). When viewed with a high-power microscope, many holes
and bubbles were observed in the membrane. The volume and number of
bubbles in the membrane could be reduced by wax modification of the
DAP (Figure 4A2,B2).
AFM was used to further analyze the roughness of the membrane surface.
The surface roughnesses of the Control and WAX2 treatment were determined
to be 7.53 and 6.78 nm, respectively. The results showed that the
surface roughness of the coating on wax-modified DAP was reduced (Figure 6D1,D2). During the
coating, the wax on DAP might buffer the particle collisions and reduce
frictions among particles to make the coatings more uniform.

DAP (A2, B2); SEM images of membrane structures of CDAP derived from
Control (C1), WAX1 (C2), WAX2 (C3), and WAX3 (C4); atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images of CDAP derived from Control (D1) and WAX2 (D2).

Particle Hardness
Crushing strength was used to characterize
the strength of different DAP and CDAP particles using the particle
hardness index.33 The particle strength
before and after coating is shown in Figure 5. As shown in the figure, wax modification
of DAP effectively improved the particle strength. When the wax content
was 3‰, the particle strength of DAP reached the highest. In
our experiment, the hardness of the DAP particles after wax modification
increased from 2.4 to 34.6%. The increase in the DAP particle hardness
corresponds to the decrease in the porosity and the reduction of special
surfaces inside the particles.34 This observation
was probably because of the penetration of molten wax into the DAP
particles, which improved the adhesion of the material inside the
particles.

Figure 5 Hardness of unmodified and wax-modified DAP particles (left) and
the corresponding CDAP particles (right). Bar heights represent means,
and error bars represent ±SE. The same letters on the bar of
each different particles (DAP particles and CDAP particles) were not
significantly different based on a one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s
multiple-range tests (P < 0.05).

On the other hand, the particle strength of the
CDAP particles
also improved with the wax modification, especially at a high wax
content of 3‰. Compared with that of the Control, the particle
hardness of CDAP derived from WAX3 increased by 13.6%. We concluded
that the wax coating increased the contact area between the fertilizer
particle and the coating materials and reduced the gap between the
DAP particles and the coating layer, leading to an increase in the
particle hardness.35 In the process of
transportation and use of fertilizers, friction and collision were
inevitable. Increasing the particle hardness could reduce the damage
of DAP and CDAP particles.

Nutrient Release Rate
Wax modification of the DAP greatly
increased P release longevity of the CDAP (Figure 6). With the increase in the coating amount, the release period
of the fertilizer was prolonged (Figure 6). For the CDAP derived from the Control
treatment, the initial release rate decreased from 30.68 to 3.63%
and the P release period extended from 7.1 to 60.4 days with the coating
content being increased from 2 to 4%. After the wax modification,
the P release characteristics of CDAP particles all significantly
improved. When the coating content was 4%, the release curves of the
CDAP from wax-modified fertilizers were all close to the ideal “S”
shape36 with the initial release rate of
only 0.22% and the release longevity of 93.4 days. In the previous
studies using the same coating materials, the release period of CDAP
with 9% coating materials was less than 25 days,15 and the release period of coated urea with 9.5% coating
materials was less than 40 days,37 and
thus, the controlled-release characteristics of CDAP prepared in this
experiment was improved significantly.

Figure 6 Phosphorus accumulative
release rate from castor-oil-based polyurethane
CDAP with different coating percentages: (A) 2%, (B) 3%, and (C) 4%;
error bars represent ±SE.

From the above characterization results, it is
apparent that the
wax-modified DAP particles had smaller specific surface areas, smaller
angles of repose, smoother surfaces, and more regular shapes, which
facilitated the coating process to improve the physicochemical properties
and release characteristics of the castor-oil-based polyurethane membrane
coatings. In addition, wax isolated the direct contact between coating
materials and DAP particles, which could reduce the reaction of PAPI
with water and ammonium in the DAP particles to improve the membrane
forming efficiency. This would not only make the member coatings more
uniform but also reduce the water infiltration into the CDAP to increase
longevity.

Conclusions
The wax modification of DAP significantly
improved the properties
and controlled-release characteristics of CDAP. After the modification,
the hardness of the modified DAP particles was significantly increased,
which ensured that the DAP particles would maintain their integrity
during the coating process and transportation. The surface roughness,
angle of repose, and specific surface area of the wax-modified DAP
showed a significant decrease. All of these facilitated the coating
process. The castor-oil-based polyurethane membrane on a wax-modified
particle surface showed uniform thickness. In addition, the controlled-release
characteristics of CDAP from wax-modified DAP were greatly improved.
This study provides facile and cost-effective technology for the preparation
of CDAP.

Experimental Section
Materials
Diammonium phosphate particles (N 18%, P2O5 46%) were obtained from Shandong Hualu Hengsheng
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Dezhou, China) and passed through a 3–5
mm sieve before surface modification and coating. Castor oil and polyaryl
polymethylene isocyanate (PAPI) used in this experiment were purchased
from Yi Hai Oil Industry Co., Ltd. (Yantai, China) and Wanhua Polyurethane
Co., Ltd. (Yantai, China), respectively. Polyolefin wax was obtained
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).

Preparation of Wax-Modified DAP Particles
Three types
of wax-modified DAP labeled WAX1, WAX2, and WAX3 were prepared by
spraying 1, 2, or 3 g of wax onto 1 kg of DAP in a preheated (50 °C)
rotation drum, respectively. During this process, the inclination
angle of the drum was 30° and the rotation speed was 30 rpm.
DAP without wax modification was used as Control.

Preparation of CDAP
Castor oil and PAPI were used as
the coating materials. The fertilizer particles (Control, WAX1, WAX2,
or WAX3) were heated to 65 °C and rotated in a drum. A mixture
of 6.0 g of PAPI and 4.0 g of castor oil was poured onto the fertilizer
surface several times. The weight of the coating materials was approximately
1% of the weight of the fertilizer each time. The coating process
was repeated 2, 3, and 4 times. During the coating process, the tilt
angle of the instrument was 30° and the rotation speed was 40
rpm. The coating content of different treatments is shown in Table 2.

Characterization
The surface morphology and smoothness
of the samples were measured using a field-emission scanning electron
microscope (SEM, Model SU8020, Hitachi, Japan). The surface roughness
was analyzed using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Multimode8, Bruker,
Germany).

The angle of repose was measured using a repose angle
tester (FBS-104, FURBS, China). Fertilizer particles (100 g) were
weighed each time and poured into the instrument. The height of the
accumulation of particles (h, cm) was recorded, as
well as the radius of the bottom tray (5 cm). The angle of repose
was then calculated through the equation: α = arc tan
(h/5).

A particle hardness tester (Yinhe Instrument
Factory, Jiangyan,
China) was used to measure the hardness of fertilizer particles by
applying an increasing compressive force on a single particle. The
instrument records the maximum pressure that a fertilizer particle
can withstand before it was broken. For each sample, 20 particles
were tested to obtain an average value.

Fertilizer temperature
distribution was measured with an infrared
camera (Testo-865, Testo, Germany). The fertilizer was placed in a
constant temperature incubator at 65 °C and removed every 5 min
to be photographed.

Specific surface area of the fertilizer
particles was determined
using a specific surface area and pore size analyzer (JW-BK300C, Beijing,
China) at liquid nitrogen temperature. The surface area was calculated
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) multipoint method.38

The release rate of CDAP was determined
using the static water
extraction method. A plastic mesh bag was filled with 10.00 g of CDAP
and placed in a plastic bottle with 200 mL of water. The plastic bottle
was placed in an incubator at 25 °C. Water from each bottle (10
mL each) was sampled at 1, 7, 10, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, and 98 days,
and the P content of the water was measured until the accumulative
release rate reached 80%.

Statistical Analysis
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary) was used for all statistical analyses, and average values and
differences of each treatment were calculated. The mean and correlation
coefficient were considered significantly different when P < 0.05. SigmaPlot version 12.5 (Systat Software Inc.) and Adobe
Photoshop CS 6 (Adobe Systems Inc.) were used for mapping.
