We present here a
reaction scheme to connect TbPc2 single-molecule
magnets into 1D architectures using acyclic diene metathesis. To investigate
the impact of the bonding through aliphatic chains on the magnetic
properties of TbPc2, we isolate and characterize the dimeric
species obtained as one of the products of the reaction. Remarkably,
the magnetic properties are only slightly modified after the formation
of the bond between molecules, enlightening the great potential of
this reaction scheme.

Introduction
In recent years, single-molecule
magnets (SMMs), which exhibit
slow magnetization relaxation of purely molecular origin, have attracted
increasing interest.1 At sufficiently low
temperatures, these coordination compounds are capable to retain magnetization
in the absence of external magnetic field for long time,2 thus allowing considering each molecule as an
alternative bit for data storage.3 Quantum
effects, like resonant quantum tunneling, observed in those systems
in the bulk2 and at the nanoscale,4 have more recently fascinated molecular magnetism
community for the use in innovative molecular devices.5

In 2003, Ishikawa and co-workers reported that lanthanide
phthalocyanine
double-deckers (LnPc2’s), sandwich-type complexes
constituted by two phthalocyaninato ligands complexing a lanthanide
(III) ion, behave as magnets at a single-molecule level.6 Their huge magnetic anisotropy is given by a
highly axial ligand field (LF) produced by an (idealized) square-antiprismatic
coordination geometry (D4d-symmetry).7 LnPc2’s
are characterized by structural robustness and versatility, which
allow a fine-tuning of their magnetic properties either by replacing
the metal ion or by varying the LF through ligand modification. The
larger energy separation between the ground and the first excited
state in the terbium derivative matches the requisites for a strong
single-molecule-magnet behavior, ruling TbPc2 as the most
promising molecule among the LnPc2 series.8 Furthermore, the introduction of peripheral functional
groups on one or both ligands is a powerful strategy to alter the
relaxation dynamics, as demonstrated by Torres and co-workers who
reported a record anisotropy barrier of ca. 938 K for TbPc2 with OC6H4-p-tBu substituents.9 However,
all of the efforts to increase the effectiveness of these SMMs are
frustrated by the presence of a highly favored relaxation pathway,
namely, the quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM),10 which is intimately related to the single-ion nature of
LnPc2.11

As indicated
by Wernsdorfer’s pioneering work on supramolecular
dimers, the interconnection of SMM centers is a powerful tool to alter
their relaxation dynamics.12 To date, different
1D, 2D, and 3D structures have been prepared through the assembly
of SMMs mainly via coordination with proper ligands,13 but the behavior of TbPc2 in similar organized
structures is still unexplored. As the synthesis of chemically connected
SMMs is a relevant step toward realization of innovative materials,13e it is necessary to define procedures to link
SMMs avoiding the quenching of the magnetic properties, which are
often very sensitive to the chemical environment.14

A chemical approach to tune the magnetic properties
of lanthanides
is to couple these elements with delocalized radicals that can interact
quite strongly with the partially shielded 4f-electrons. A strong
influence of the coupling between lanthanides and radicals was indeed
observed in both single chains15 and molecular
dimers.16 In these systems, the relaxation
dynamics is often ruled by the strong interaction that sometimes is
able to cause opening of hysteresis and ordering at low temperatures.15e Interestingly, Wang and co-workers reported
that also phthalocyanine-based sandwich-type dysprosium and yttrium
complexes highly benefit from the formation of π-bridged dimers,
due to mitigation of QTM.17

Herein,
we report the first example of TbPc2 organization
in covalent 1D structures, in particular oligomeric chains obtained
by acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET).18 Kobayashi
and co-workers have already successfully applied this reaction to
metallated phthalocyanines.19 Although
it shows some similarity with the more common ring-opening metathesis
polymerization, ADMET is less active and gives rise to polymers with
lower molecular weight, but it can be applied to a broader range of
monomers. Like other metathesis reactions, ADMET proceeds under thermodynamic
equilibrium and product formation must be favored by byproduct removal,
which can be simplified using terminal olefins that evolve gaseous
ethylene from the reaction. Terminal double bonds are among the few
functional groups capable to survive harsh conditions required for
TbPc2 synthesis.20

Results and Discussion
On the basis of these considerations, a homoleptic bis-ω-alkenyl
TbPc2 monomer (3) was synthesized from the
corresponding monofunctionalized phthalocyanine (2; Scheme 1, for characterizations
see Figures S1–S8). Phthalocyanine 2 was obtained by Williamson reaction between 11-bromo-1-undecene
and phthalocyanine 1 bearing one hydroxy group.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of TbPc2 Oligomers
Double-decker formation was carried out by the reaction
of phthalocyaninato
ligand 2 with terbium (III) acetylacetonate hydrate in
1-hexadecanol at 180 °C in the presence of lithium methoxide.21 Repeated purifications by column and preparative
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) afforded TbPc23 as a mixture of constitutional isomers in 49% yield. The formation
of the desired complex was confirmed by the presence of the molecular
peak in the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) spectrum (Figure S7).

ADMET oligomerization of 3, in the presence of a second-generation
Grubbs catalyst, was initially performed in dichloromethane at room
temperature with a monomer concentration of 2.4 mM. Under these conditions,
the product of the intramolecular reaction between the two ω-alkenyl
chains (3′, Scheme 1) was found to be the major component of the reaction
mixture, as indicated by MALDI-TOF analysis (Figure 1a).
To maximize the formation of intermolecular oligomers, the monomer
concentration was increased by an order of magnitude ([3] = 24 mM). The reaction time was also incremented from 24 to 72
h, and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) was chosen as a solvent to reduce
solvent loss by evaporation. MALDI-TOF analysis of the resulting mixture
(Figure 1b) revealed
the formation of oligomeric structures (up to pentamers). To simplify
the magnetic characterization and isolate one contribution, we isolated
the major component, TbPc2 dimer 4, by preparative
TLC (yield of 4 ≈ 23%). MALDI-TOF characterization
of 4 revealed the presence of a tiny amount of impurities,
identifiable as the monomer and the trimer (Figure S8). The magnetic properties of 4 were studied
without further purification.

Figure 1 (a) High-resolution MALDI-TOF spectrum (expanded
2800–3500 m/z region) of
the mixture obtained with
[3] = 2.4 mM; the structure of intramolecular reaction
product 3′ is shown in the inset; (b) MALDI-TOF
spectrum of the crude obtained with [3] = 24 mM, the
generic structure of oligomers is shown in the inset.

Preliminary magnetic characterization of TbPc2 dimer 4 was performed with standard dc magnetic
techniques. The
χT saturation value at room temperature (Figure S9) is close to the value of two independent
Tb3+ ions (7F6, S = 3, L = 3, J = 6, gJ = 3/2) and two S = 1/2 delocalized
radicals (24.39 emu K mol–1), confirming the magnetic
purity of the sample. The slight increase between 300 and 250 K can
be due to either CF effects or the presence of a small amount of diamagnetic
impurities. Conversely, the increase at low temperature (T < 7 K) is attributed most likely to intermolecular interactions
or to CF effects. However, an LF that reproduces the experimental
increase at low T needs a very uncommon energy splitting,
never observed for TbPc2 derivatives and very different
from the ones reported by Ishikawa for the anionic form of TbPc2. In Figure S10, we reported the
simulation of the χT curve using both Ishikawa
parameters7 and a set of parameters that
qualitatively reproduces the low-temperature behavior. To investigate
the origin of the peculiar feature of χT at low temperatures,
we can foresee the use of high-dilution experiments in an YPc2 diamagnetic matrix, to significantly enlarge the intermolecular
distance and thus suppress the presence of interactions between dimers.22

In Figure 2, we
reported the hysteresis curves measured by varying the applied field
between 30 and −30 kOe (scan rate 200 Oe s–1), at three different temperatures (2, 3, and 5 K). We observed the
typical butterfly shape, ascribed to the presence of QTM at zero applied
field. For each temperature tested, dimer 4 showed a
less-pronounced hysteresis compared to that shown by the monomeric
unsubstituted TbPc2. However, the magnetization saturation
value appeared to be comparable.14

Figure 2 Temperature
dependence of the hysteresis loop recorded on dimer 4, with the field sweeping rate of 200 Oe s–1.

Ac measurements were also performed
to shed light on the dynamic
properties of compound 4: the magnetic susceptibility
(χ) was measured at temperatures between 2 and 60 K, varying
the frequency from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz at two different static magnetic
fields (H = 0 Oe and 5 kOe, Table 1). The occurrence of a maximum in the out-of-phase
component (χ″) of the magnetic susceptibility indicated
the presence of slow relaxation of magnetization (Figures S11–S18). The fit of the χ″(ν)
isotherms, using the Casimir and Du Pré formula (reported in Supporting Information),23 provided the most reliable means of determining the relaxation time
(τ), defined as the reversal of the frequency at which χ″
is maximum. To check if all of the magnetic centers inside the sample
followed the same relaxation pathway, in Figure S19 we compared the values of the magnetic susceptibility obtained
from dc measurements with the values of χT –
χS (difference between the isotherm and the adiabatic
susceptibility)22 extracted from the ac
fits. The values, superimposable in the whole temperature range, confirmed
that the same relaxation pathway dominates the relaxation of all magnetic
centers. Moreover, the relatively high values of the distribution
of relaxation times (see Figure S20) are
not surprising because of the chemical strain introduced by the aliphatic
chain that interconnects the molecules. In Figure S21, we reported the logarithm of the extracted relaxation
times as a function of 1/T. For H = 0 Oe, the relaxation time follows two different laws depending
on the temperature range. For low temperatures, τ approaches
a constant value and the relaxation dynamics is dominated by quantum
tunneling of the magnetization. For high temperatures, ln(τ)
becomes linearly dependent on 1/T (Arrhenius behavior).
When a static magnetic field of 5 kOe is applied, the quantum tunneling
is suppressed and the Arrhenius behavior is extended also at lower
temperatures. Coherently with the literature, we performed an Arrhenius
fit of τ in the high-temperature regime, to provide an estimation
of the barrier for the relaxation of the magnetization (Ueff) and the pre-exponential factor (τ0). Comparing our results with the values relative to amorphous pristine
TbPc2,14 it appears clear that
the result of the connection between magnetic centers through the
carbon chain is a slight decrease of the relaxation barrier and an
increase of the pre-exponential factor. The result indicates that
the connection between the molecules introduces a strain that causes
lowering of the LF symmetry and thus a decrease of the relaxation
barrier. However, it is worth noticing that the slow relaxation and
the hysteretic behavior typical of isolated TbPc2 molecules
are just dumped and not quenched, confirming the robustness of the
magnetic behavior of these molecules.14,20

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully applied ADMET to the oligomerization
of TbPc2 molecules. Selectivity among intramolecular and
intermolecular reaction pathways was found to be concentration-dependent.
The poor solubility of TbPc2 monomer 3 limits
further improvement of the oligomerization yield. Investigations on
the magnetic behavior of dimer 4 revealed an anisotropy
barrier of the two connected SMMs slightly lower with respect to the
pristine TbPc2 and a less-pronounced hysteretic behavior.
This can be rationalized considering that the length of the aliphatic
spacer used to connect the two magnetic centers prevents any significant
coupling effect and introduces a LF strain. Nevertheless, the nontrivial
retaining of the magnetic properties allows identifying the ADMET-based
protocol as a valid candidate for the realization of TbPc2 1D structures. Thus, to improve the performances of the connected
TbPc2 molecules, an optimization of the reaction and the
use of highly conjugated chains will be necessary.

Experimental
Section
Unless stated otherwise, reactions were conducted
in flame-dried
glassware under an atmosphere of argon using anhydrous solvents (either
freshly distilled or passed through activated alumina columns). All
commercially obtained reagents were used as received unless otherwise
specified. Silica column chromatography was performed using silica
gel 60 (Fluka 230–400 mesh or Merck 70–230 mesh). 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE 300 (300
MHz) and a Bruker AVANCE 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer at 25 °C.
All chemical shifts (δ) were reported in ppm relative to the
proton resonances resulting from incomplete deuteration of the NMR
solvents. High-resolution MALDI-TOF was performed on an AB SCIEX MALDI
TOF–TOF 4800 Plus (matrix: a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid).
UV–vis spectra were collected using a Thermo Scientific Evolution
260 Bio spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier water-cooled cell
changer device, using matched quartz cells of 1 cm path length. Compound 1 was prepared according to modified published procedures.24

and the mixture was heated at 180 °C for 1 h. After cooling,
hexane was added and the mixture was filtrated. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure, and the crude was purified by flash column
chromatography (gradient from hexane/CH2Cl2 1:1
to hexane/CH2Cl2 3:7). Further purification
by preparative TLC (hexane/CH2Cl2 1:1) afforded
product 3 as a green solid (0.041 g, 0.012 mmol, 49%). UV–vis:

Metathesis Oligomerization of 3
Method
a: TbPc23 (0.011 g, 0.003
mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 mL of freshly distilled and degassed CH2Cl2. Second-generation Grubbs catalyst (0.14 mg,
5 mol %) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature
overnight. The reaction was quenched with MeOH (100 mL), and the green
precipitate was filtered and dried. Method b: TbPc23 (0.080 g, 0.024 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL

mode, calcd for C410H428N32O28Tb2 [M]+m/z = 6569.2; found m/z =
6569.4.

Magnetic Measurements
The dc magnetic characterization
was performed using a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer. The
ac characterization at frequency between 0.1 and 1000 Hz (Figures S10–S11 and S14–S15) was
performed using the same instrument used for dc. The high-temperature–high-frequency
ac measurements were performed using a Quantum Design PPMS (Figures S12–S13 and S16–S17). The
investigated sample was a pellet composed by 8.1 mg of microcrystalline
powder, to avoid in-field orientation of the microcrystallites.
