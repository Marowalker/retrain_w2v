The gold nanoreaction between HAuCl4 and H2O2 is very slow at 50 °C,
and the nanoenzyme of graphene
oxide (GO) greatly catalyzes the nanoreaction to form gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) with high SERS activity in the presence of Vitoria blue 4R
(VB4r) molecular probes, strong resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS),
and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption effect. With the increase
of GO, the SERS, RRS, and SPR absorptions were enhanced linearly due
to the formation of more AuNPs. The rabit antibody of human chorionic
gonadotropin (RHCG) strongly adsorbed on the GO surface to inhibit
its catalysis. Upon addition of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG),
the RHCG is separated from the GO surface due to the formation of
HCG-RHCG specific immunocomplexes, which led to the recovery of GO
catalysis. Using the new strategy of immunocontrolling GO catalysis,
three types of resonance methods including SERS, RRS, and surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption have been developed for detection
of HCG.

Introduction
Nanoparticles such
as gold and graphene oxide not only are of enzyme
property but also have high SERS activity. Since the Fe3O4 nanoenzyme was reported,1 research interest has risen rapidly, and it has been involved widely
in different fields such as materials, physics, chemistry, biology,
medicine, and environmental sciences. Compared with the natural bioenzyme,
nanoenzymes have high stability and high catalytic activity, are cheap,
and have other advantages over bioenzymes, especially to avoid the
characteristics of bioenzymes of instability and variability. This
unique property enhanced the application prospect of nanoenzymes in
process catalysis and enzyme kinetics. Thus, these nanoparticles with
catalytic activity have important significance in analytical chemistry.
At present, the analytical application is mainly involved in the detection
of heavy metal ions and biological molecules,2−8 based on nanoenzyme catalytic colored reactions. Seok et al.2 detected mercury ions, which based on the principle
of ssDNA magnetic nanoparticles can inhibit the H2O2 oxidation of phthalate to amine with no color, and 5–75
μmoL/L of Hg(II) caused the color deepening. Lien et al.3 used fluorescence enhancement to detect thrombin
for H2O2 oxidization of Amplex reagent by thrombin
transforming protein-mediated Bi-AuNPs, and Jiang et al.4 reported a simple nanogold catalytic spectrophotometric
method for 2–10 nmoL/L of glucose. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) is due to some molecules adsorbed on a rough surface of the
nanoparticles that caused the Raman scattering signal-enhanced phenomenon.9−12 It not only sensitively detects the concentration of molecules adsorbed
on the nanosurface but also gives rich information on the molecular
structure and has been widely used in materials, chemicals, polymer
materials, biological, environmental protection, and other fields.13,14 According to the use of molecular probe markers, SERS can be divided
into SERS marking technology and free-label SERS technology. SERS
free-label technology is directly detected by the Raman signal itself
or use of dye molecules to probe the Raman signal, according to the
Raman fingerprints of the material to be quantitatively or qualitatively
analyzed, with some advantages such as simple, fast, and direct use
of the sample Raman characteristic signal without additional marking
processing of the sample, which avoids the destruction of the sample,
and these merits attract much attention.15,16 In addition, we have known that stable and highly SERS-active nanosol
substrates are very important to SERS quantitative analysis. Although
some gold nanosol substrates prepared by citrate and NaBH4 were used, the stable and highly SERS active nanosol substrate and
nanoreaction with SERS activity will be explored still in SERS quantitative
analysis, by means of green nanocatalytic synthesis.

Metal-free
catalysts are newly emerging green catalytic materials
that have attracted much attention in recent years for their advantanges
of high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and economy in many
industrial catalytic processes.17,18 An important type of
inorganic metal-free catalyst is nanocarbon materials that have demonstrated
superior catalytic performance to traditional metal catalysts in many
fields.19,20 Metal-free carbon-based catalysis has become
one of the most promising research directions in nanomaterials and
catalysis. The carbon material itself is used as the catalyst, and
no metal is loaded or added; therefore, the active sites for the reaction
are the defective structure or functional groups on the carbon surface.
Graphene oxide (GO) is a kind of new carbon material with excellent
performance such as good catalysis, high specific surface area, and
abundant surface hydroxyl groups.21−26 In recent years, it has become a hot spot due to its unique physical,
chemical, and biological characteristics.27−29 He et al.27 reported that GO prepared by the Hummers method
could catalyze the hydrolysis of soybean isoflavones. In the nanoanalysis,30−38 Wang et al. established a resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) method
to detect HSA, using GO as a probe.30 The
SERS effect of GO was studied by Hao et al.31 The SERS properties of GO/Au/Ag composites were better than those
of pure gold and silver nanoparticles. Banchelli’s research
group found that GO–Ag composite nanoparticles were more effective
than silver nanomaterials when used as a substrate in SERS analysis.32 Wang et al.33 used
Cu2+-ion-modified graphene oxide nanoparticles as a heterogeneous
catalyst, mimicking functions of horseradish peroxidase for the chemiluminescence
detection of H2O2 and glucose. The dispersed
Co3O4 nanoparticle-decorated crumpled graphene
microsphere (CGM) possessed intrinsic peroxidase-like activity and
could catalytically oxidize 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
by H2O2 to produce a typical blue product and
can be used to detect 30–140 μM ascorbic acid colorimetrically.34 An amperometric sensor was established for the
detection of 0.1–43 μM indole-3-acetic acid, based on
the hemin/reduced graphene oxide (hemin/rGO) composite with peroxidase-like
activity.35 Rapid detection of sarcosine
is a key requirement for both diagnosis and treatment of disease.
A simple and sensitive colorimetric nanocomposite platform was reported
for rapid detection of 0.73 μM sarcosine,36 based on the GO catalysis of the colored reaction of 1,
2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid sodium salt (NQS) that functionalized
the GO nanocomposite through π–π stacking. At present,
there are no reports about GO catalytic nanoparticle reaction with
SERS activity and its application in nanoanalysis.

HCG is a
glycoprotein secreted by the placenta trophoblast cells,
and it is an important medical diagnostic marker of pregnancy. It
also is one of the important markers of clinical diseases, and its
content is closely related to some diseases, such as gestational trophoblastic
disease, germ cell tumors, and Down syndrome.39 In addition, the quantitative detection of HCG is of great significance
to the analysis of clinical medicine and the abuse of stimulants.
Immunoassay is a sensitive and selective analytical technology and
was greatly paid attention by analysts.40−43 The detection methods are mainly
immunoassays such as electrochemical, electrochemiluminescence, chemiluminescent,
chemiluminescence resonance energy, fluorescence, resonance Rayleigh
scattering, enzyme, and radioassay.44−46 Among them, the electrochemical
immunoassay method has high sensitivity, but the operation is complex;
the cost of fluorescence immunoassay is low, but there is a fluorescence
quenching effect. Radioimmunoassay is widely used, but there are radiation
hazards. Immunogold assay was the most mature and most widely used
method for rapid detection of HCG, but this method can only detect
whether or not HCG is present, and it is difficult to analyze the
content. However, the application of SERS monitoring the GO catalytic
oxidation–reduction nanoparticle reaction, the regulation of
the GO catalytic activity by immune reaction, and its application
in nanoanalysis have not been reported . In this paper, a new SERS
quantitative analysis method was developed for HCG, based on the immune
regulation of GO nanoenzyme activity of the gold nanoparticle reaction.

Results
and Discussion
Analysis Principle
Nanocatalytic
reaction is an important
route for analytical signal amplification and sensitivity improvement.
The new nanoparticle catalytic reaction of H2O2–HAuCl4 nanoparticle was investigated and used
in the resonance scattering spectral analysis. The potential difference
of +0.307 V indicates the reaction could take place. In fact, the
reaction is very slow in the absence of nanocatalyst. Therefore, the
uncatalytic reaction system exhibits weak SERS signal due to low concentration
of AuNP as substrate, in the presence of VB4r molecular probes. We
have known that GO containing abundant surface π electrons,
the AuCl4– and H2O2, can be adsorbed on the GO surface, and the electron transfer of
the AuNP reaction was enhanced greatly by means of the π electrons.
The produced small AuNPs could also act as nanocatalysts to speed
the AuNP reaction. More AuNPs formed in the nanocatalytic system,
and the SERS signal increased linearly with GO concentration. According
to SERS theory, the SERS intensity (ISERS) is related to incident laser intensity (Iin), molecular probe concentration (CM), and the enhancement factor (Ef) of substrate physical properties such as size and shape of nanoparticles
and the degree of aggregation, etc.47−49 The difficulty in obtaining
highly stable and reproducible SERS signals renders SERS a qualitative
or semiquantitative detection technique. Although some methods such
as internal standard have been used to correct SERS intensity variations
induced by the variations in the physical properties of SERS substrate,
the process is complicated, and the internal standard is uneasy to
obtain. Using highly stable and reproducible nanosol as SERS substrate,
simple and accurate SERS quantitative analysis methods could be developed,
and the SERS signals depend on not only the CM but also the nanosol concentration (CN); that is, ISERS = K1 × Iin × Ef × CM = K2 × Iin × CA × CN = K3 × CN. When
the experimental conditions hold constant, the K is
a constant; the ISERS is linear to CN; and the nanocatalyst GO concentration (CGO) is linear to CN, according to catalytic kinetics. Thus, the ISERS is linear to CGO that could
be detected by SERS technique, as in Figure 1a. The RHCG has high affinity and specificity
for antigen, and it can be easily adsorbed to the GO surfaces through
electrostatic attraction that leads to weakening of GO catalysis (Figure 1b). When the HCG
is present in solution, the RHCG selectively recognizes and tightly
binds to HCG to form immunocomplexes that escape from the GO surface
and the GO catalytic activity recovery, and the SERS signal enhanced
linearly due to the formation of more active AuNPs as substrate (Figure 1c). Thus, a new SERS
method was developed for the determination of trace HCG, with high
sensitivity and selectivity.

SERS Spectra
For
the immuno-controlling system of HAuCl4–H2O2, the VB4r was used as a
SERS probe; the main SERS peaks showed at 435 cm–1, 803 cm–1, 1197 cm–1, 1203 cm–1, 1398 cm–1, and 1615 cm–1; the assignment of those SERS peaks was examined (Table S1); and the intensity increased linearly at 1615 cm–1 with the increase of HCG concentration (Figure 2a). For the immunocontrolling
system of HAuCl4–TCA and HAuCl4–GS,
the SERS peaks showed at 434 cm–1, 804 cm–1, 1201 cm–1, 1292 cm–1, 1388
cm–1, and 1618 cm–1, and the SERS
intensity increased linearly at 1613 cm–1 with the
increase of HCG concentration (Figure 2b, 2c). In the three analytical
systems, the HAuCl4–H2O2 system
is the most sensitive and most stable and was chosen for SERS detection
of HCG. The SERS spectra of H2O2–HAuCl4–GO nanocatalytic system were recorded (Figure S1A). The SERS intensity at 1617 cm–1 increased linearly with the increase of GO nanocatalyst
concentration. Similarly, small AuNPs also exhibited strong catalysis
of the HAuCl4–H2O2 reaction
from the SERS spectra (FigureS1B). The
SERS spectra of the RHCG–GO–H2O2–HAuCl4 system showed that the SERS intensity decreased
linearly with the increase of RHCG concentration (Figure S1C), and RHCG has strong inhibition on the catalysis.

RRS Spectra
RRS
is a sensitive spectral technique to
determine trace metal and organic compounds such as protein and DNA,
and it is also a good and sensitive tool to investigate nanoparticle
reaction30,50−52 and was selected to
study the AuNP nanreaction. The as-prepared AuNPs exhibited strong
catalysis on the HAuCl4–H2O2 reaction that indicated that formed small AuNPs in the reaction
process also have catalysis, in which there are two RRS peaks at 300
and 540 nm (Figure 3a). The RRS spectra of GO–HAuCl4–H2O2, RHCG–GO–HAuCl4–H2O2, and RHCG–HCG–GO–HAuCl4–H2O2 nanocatalytic systems were
recorded. All systems exhibited two RRS peaks at 300 and 540 nm (Figure 3c–3d), and GO, RHCG, and HCG have catalysis, inhabition,
and recovery catalysis, respectively. The RRS peak at 300 nm was chosen
for detection of HCG, with high sensitivity.

0.67, 1.67, 3.33, 6, 9, 13.3, and 16.67 ng/mL HCG, respectively.

SPR Absorption Spectra
The SPR absorption spectral
technique is a simple and low-cost tool to examine some nanoparticles
such as AuNPs in solution and was chosen for the AuNP reaction. For
the GO–HAuCl4–H2O2 nanoreaction
(Figure 4a), the product
of AuNPs exhibited a SPR absorption peak at about 580 nm, and the
peak appeared to blue-shift with increasing GO concentration that
indicated the formed AuNP size decreased. For the AuNP–HAuCl4–H2O2 system (Figure 4b), the product of AuNPs exhibited
a SPR absorption peak at about 520 nm, and these results indicated
that the formed small AuNPs in the reaction procces could also catalyze
the nanoparticle reaction; that is, there is self-catalysis in the
system. The spectra of the RHCG–GO–HAuCl4–H2O2 and RHCG–HCG–GO–HAuCl4–H2O2 systems (Figure 4c) showed that the catalytic
activity of the GO nanoenzyme inhibited by RHCG and HCG recovery the
GO activity, and the absorption value at 530 nm could be used for
detection of HCG selectively (Figure 4d).

1.67, 3.33, 5, 6.67, 10, and 13.3 ng/mL HCG, respectively.

GO Catalysis and Its Mechanism
The
three spectral techniques
including SERS, RRS, and SPR absorption were used to study the AuNP
reaction of HAuCl4–H2O2. Results
(Table 1) showed that
the SERS and RRS intensity and SPR absorption value increased linearly
with the GO catalyst concentration increasing, and the SERS is most
sensitive with biggest slope in the linear equation. The AuNPs with
size of 8 nm also exhibited catalysis of the AuNP reaction, but it
is less than the activity of GO. However, when RHCG concentration
increased, the SERS and RRS intensity and SPR absorption value decreased
linearly. The reason was that they could be attached to the surface
of the GO nanocatalyst by intermolecular forces, to block the contact
between the catalyst and the reactants and inhibit the catalytic activity.

The heterogeneous electron transfer of sp2 carbons occurs
at the edges and defects and not at the basal plan of graphene sheets.53 Oxygen-containing groups on the GO surface and
the super high surface area provided by its two-dimensional structure
can enhance the electron transfer rate.54,55 In the experimental
conditions, the redox nanoparticle reaction of HAuCl4–H2O2 could be catalyzed by GO and small AuNPs but
does not speed by graphene that does not dissolve in water, and the
GO catalysis is stronger than the AuNPs in size of 8 nm. We speculate
that the smaller AuNPs formed in the reaction process have stronger
catalysis. For the nanocatalytic system, when the VB4r was used as
the SERS probe, the SERS peak at I1617 cm-1 was the most obvious change, and the SERS effect increased linearly
related to the nanocatalyst concentration. Accordingly, The RRS intensity/SPR
absorption and the nanocatalyst concentration also had a linear relationship.
In short, H2O2 and HAuCl4 could adsorb
to the GO surface that is of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and
has abundant surface π electrons, and the redox electron transfer
could be enhanced greatly by means of the π electrons; meanwhile,
the formed small AuNPs in the redox process could catalyze the redox
to form more AuNPs (Figure 5).

Figure 5 GO catalytic mechanism for the H2O2 reduction
of HAuCl4 to form AuNPs. The GO surface had abundant surface
π electrons that enhanced the redox electron transfer of H2O2–HAuCl4 to form small AuNPs
rapidly and growth. Meanwhile, the small AuNPs also catalyzed the
redox reaction to form more AuNPs, that is, autonanocatalysis.

TEM and ED
The
transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
is used to observe the particle size and surface morphology. The TEM
(Figure 6) of the RHCG–HCG–GO–H2O2–HAuCl4 system was recorded,
and it showed that the gold nanoparticles in solution were less in
the absence of HCG, with an average size of 25 nm. When HCG was added
into the solution, the generated gold nanoparticles with size of 15
nm increased due to the nanocatalyst GO concentration increasing,
and all three energy spectral peaks are at 1.7, 2.1, and 9.7 keV for
the Au element.

Optimization of Analysis Conditions
For the RHCG–HCG–GO–H2O2–HAuCl4–VB4r system,
the analytical conditions, including GO, RHCG, HCl, HAuCl4, H2O2, and VB4r, the reaction temperature,
and time (Figure S2) were optimized, respectively.
The effects of GO concentration on the ΔI1616 cm-1 were investigated, and a 50 ng/mL GO
was selected to use. The effects of RHCG concentration on ΔI1616 cm-1 were investigated, and
when it reached 13.33 ng/mL, the value of ΔI1616 cm-1 was the largest; therefore, 13.33
ng/mL was selected. The dosage of HCl was optimized, and when the
concentration of HCl was 0.15 mmoL/L, ΔI1616 cm-1 reached the maximum value. A value of
0.15 mmoL/L HCl was chosen. When the HAuCl4 concentration
was 6.3 μmoL/L, the ΔI1616 cm-1 value was the largest and was selected for use. When the H2O2 concentration was 2.5 mmoL/L, the value of ΔI1616 cm-1 was the largest, and 2.5
mmoL/L H2O2 was chosen. The VB4r probe concentration
was considered, and the value of ΔI1616 cm-1 was the largest when the concentration of VB4r achieved 0.375 μmoL/L;
therefore, 0.375 μmoL/L VB4r was selected. Under the optimal
reagent conditions, the reaction temperature and time were examined.
A reaction time of 8 min at 50 °C, giving the largest ΔI1616 cm-1, was selected for use.
GO also catalyzed the gold nanoparticle reaction of TCA–HAuCl4, and the RHCG–HCG–GO–TCA–HAuCl4–VB4r system could be used for SERS detection of HCG.
The conditions of the RHCG–HCG–GO–TCA–HAuCl4–VB4r system were optimized (Figure S3). A 13.33 ng/mL RHCG, 50 ng/mL GO, 0.34 mmoL/L TCA, 5.6
μmoL/L HAuCl4, 0.167 mmoL/L HCl, and 0.25 μmoL/L
VB4r and a reaction temperature of 60 °C for 10 min were selected
for use. The analytical conditions of the RHCG–HCG–GO–GS–HAuCl4–VB4r system were examined (Figure S4). A 0.5 mmoL/L HCl, 100 ng/mL GO, 20 ng/mL RHCG, 50 mmoL/L
GS, 5.6 μmoL/L HAuCl4, and 0.33 μmoL/L VB4r
and a reaction temperature of 75 °C for 20 min were selected
for use.

Working Curve
For the system of RHCG–HCG–GO–H2O2–HAuCl4–VB4r, the SERS
effect was enhanced with increasing HCG concentration, and the SERS
intensity ΔI1617 cm-1 had a good linear relationship with HCG concentration in the range
of 0.25–10 ng/mL, with a linear equation of ΔI1617 cm-1 = 101.6C + 31.8, a correlation
coefficient of 0.9905, and a detection limit of 0.07 ng/mL, and the
RRS and Abs working curves were also obtained. For the system of RHCG–HCG–GO–TCA–HAuCl4–VB4r, the linear range is 0.67–20 ng/mL HCG,
with a linear equation of ΔI1615 cm-1 = 143.1C – 50.8, a coefficient of 0.9972, and a detection
of 0.5 ng/mL. For the system of RHCG–HCG–GO–GS–HAuCl4–VB4r, the linear range is 0.67–26.67 ng/mL
HCG, with a linear equation of ΔI1618 cm-1 = 55.2 + 36.4, a coefficient of 0.995, and a detection limit of
0.25 ng/mL. From Table 2, we can see that the SERS system of HAuCl4–H2O2 is the most sensitive, which was chosen for
sample detection. Although the sensitivity of the absorption method
is inferior to the SERS and RRS methods, the cost is lowest. The sensitivity
and cost of the RRS method are between the SERS and RRS methods.

Interference
The
effect of the coexisting substances
on the system for the SERS detection of 10 ng/mL HCG was investigated.
The tested common interfering ions and amino acids, IgG and IgM, did
not interfere with the determination when the relative error was within
10% (Table S2). It indicated that this
nanocatalytic SERS method had good electivity

Analysis of Samples
Five serum samples of women were
offered by the No.5 People’s Hospital of Guilin, Guangxi, China,
and a 1.0 mL sample was diluted to 100 mL with water before determination.
The following operations were according to the procedure of the RHCG–HCG–GO–H2O2–HAuCl4–VB4r system.
In addition, recovery tests were performed. The results (Table S3) show that the recoveries were in the
range of 96.40–98.76%, and the RSDs were in the range of 0.93–3.97%.
The obtained results were not obviously different from clinical diagnosis
values of the No.5 People’s Hospital, so the results demonstrate
that the method was accurate and reliable.

Conclusions
First,
the GO–H2O2–HAuCl4 nanocatalytic
particle reaction was studied in detail by
SERS, RRS, and SPR absorption techniques. Then, the antibody protein
adsorbed on the surface of GO nanoparticles, which blocked the binding
of the nanoenzyme to the reactants and inhibited its catalytic action,
and the enhancement of catalytic effect led to the increase of SERS
effect when the antigen was added. Finally, according to this principle
of immunecontrolling GO activity, a new SERS method for HCG was established.
Furthermore, other immunoreactions would combine with the GO catalysis
to develop the SERS detection platform.

Experimental Section
Apparatus
A model of DXR smart Raman spectrometer (Thermo
Company, United States) with laser wavelength of 633 nm and power
of 3.0 mW, a model of Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Varian Company, United States), and a model of TU-1901 double-beam
UV–visible spectrophotometer (Beijing General Instrument Co.,
LTD, China) were used.

Reagents
A 0.50 mg human chorionic
gonadotropin (HCG,
Beijing Boosen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) freeze-dried powder was dissolved
in 1.0 mL of water and then diluted to 10 mL to obtain a 50 μg/mL
HCG standard solution. The solution was diluted to a solution of 1
μg/mL before use. A 0.1 mg/mL rabbit antibody of HCG (RHCG,
Beijing Boosen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), 84 μmoL/L (1%) HAuCl4·4H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.),
0.1 moL/L H2O2, 1% trisodium citrate (TCA, Guangdong
Shantou Xilong Chemical Factory), 0.5 moL/L glucose (GS), 0.1 moL/L
HCl, 0.3 mol/L CH3COOH, and 0.1 mmoL/L Victoria blue 4R
(VB4r) were prepared. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by the Hummer
procedure,30 and 1 mg of GO was dissolved
in 100 mL of water by means of ultrasound to obtain a concentration
of 10 μg/mL of GO. AuNPs with size of 8 nm were prepared by
the NaBH4 procedure. All reagents are analytically pure,
and the water was double-distilled.

Procedure
We put
a moderate amount of GO, RHCG, and
HCG into a 5 mL test tube and mixed well. Then, H2O2, HCl, and HAuCl4 were added into the test tube,
diluted to 1.5 mL and mixed well, reacted in a water bath for a certain
time, and cooled with tap water. Finally, molecular probes of VB4r
were added, diluted to 2 mL, and mixed well. The mixture was transferred
into a quartz cell, and we recorded its SERS spectra. The SERS peak
intensity I1615 cm-1 and the
blank (I1615 cm-1)0 without HCG were recorded, and the ΔI1615 cm-1 = I1615 cm-1 – (I1615 cm-1)0 was calculated.
