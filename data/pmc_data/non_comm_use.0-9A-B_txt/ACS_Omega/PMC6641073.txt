To
develop novel immobilized metallocomplex catalysts, allyltris(3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-1-yl)borate
(allyl-TpCF3) was synthesized. A boron-attached allyl group
reacts with thiol to afford the desired mesoporous silica-immobilized
TpCF3. Cobalt(II) is an efficient probe for estimating
the structures of the immobilized metallocomplexes. The structures
of the formed cobalt(II) complexes and their catalytic activity depended
on the density of the organic thiol groups and on the state of the
remaining sulfur donors on the supports.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borates
(TpR) and related multidentate
“scorpionate” ligands have been utilized extensively
in coordination chemistry, with applications in areas such as organometallic
and biomimetic catalysis.1 An attractive
characteristic of TpR is the feasibility for molecular
designing by incorporation of the appropriate substituent groups on
the pyrazolyl rings. Both electronic and structural properties of
the substituent groups on the R3–R5 positions
of the pyrazolyl rings influence the reactivity at the metal center
of the resulting complex.1,2 Recently, interest in
the modification of the boron center of TpR has increased.
Replacement of a boron-attached hydride to a suitable functional group
might yield a corresponding boron center-functionalized ligand (FG-TpR) that is applicable to various conjugate materials, with
retention of the facially capping tridentate metal-supporting scaffolds.3−5

Immobilization of FG-TpR on organic polymer-based
supports
has been achieved. Notably, the molecular structures of TpR–metal complexes correlate with the flexibility of the base
polymer.5 On the flexible polymer support,
metalation of the immobilized TpR yields a coordinatively
saturated [M(TpR)2] species because the flexible
polymer backbone results in two approaching TpR moieties.
Although the formed [M(TpR)2] sites function
as cross-linking points of the polymers,5b these sites appear to be catalytically inert. By contrast, TpR can be immobilized while retaining a high-dispersion state
on the rigid supports. In fact, the Tp ligand immobilized on the less
flexible, highly cross-linked polystyrene resin support yields the
desired coordinatively unsaturated [M(TpR)(L)n] species, some of which exhibit catalytic activity.5c Even in the successful resin-supported compounds,
the correlation between the structure of the formed metal–TpR complexes and the local environments of the immobilized TpR ligands (which are affected by the morphology of the support,
density of TpR, interaction of metals with functional groups
other than immobilized ligands, etc.) has never been examined. A few
TpR-based heterogenized metallocomplex catalysts in which
the boron centers of TpR are not functionalized (i.e.,
in which a hydride group remains) and silica and resin beads are used
as supports have been reported thus far.6 Also, iron complexes of tris(pyrazolyl)methane, which is a carbon-centered
Tp analogue, have been immobilized on zeolite and carbon materials
with similar manner, and catalytic activities of the immobilized complexes
are higher than those of the corresponding homogeneous parent.7 By contrast, immobilization of FG-TpR on rigid inorganic supports has not been reported so far.8 Controlling the three-dimensional environments
surrounding the immobilized FG-TpR and its metallocomplexes
can be achieved using these inorganic supports with an ordered structure.
In this context, we have been developing ordered mesoporous, silica-immobilized
metallocomplex catalysts based on FG-TpR, as reported herein.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Allyl-TpCF3 and Its Complexes of Cobalt(II)
Our imidazole-based
scorpionate analogue, allylbis(imidazolyl)methylborate (Lallyl), can be immobilized onto thiol-functionalized inorganic supports
using thiol–ene coupling.9 A similar
ligand immobilization method has also been used with the N,N,O-type carbon-based scorpionate
compound.8c Therefore, we have designed
an allyl-functionalized tris(3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-1-yl)borate
(allyl-TpCF3) as a metal-supporting ligand for a biomimetic
oxidation catalyst because fluoroalkyl groups resist oxidation.10 Thus far, a nonsubstituted pyrazole-based ligand,
allyl-TpH, has been synthesized by Camerano et al.11 Our target ligand, allyl-TpCF3, can
be synthesized in a similar manner: condensation of allylbis(alkoxy)borane
with two equiv of 3-trifluoromethylpyrazole (pzCF3H) and
nucleophilic addition of a potassium salt of pzCF3.

Before immobilization of the synthesized allyl-TpCF3 onto
inorganic supports, we examined coordination properties of the ligand
toward cobalt(II) and characterized the resulting complexes. We selected
cobalt(II) because of its usefulness as a structural probe stemming
from the rich chemistry associated with the correlation between coordination
geometries of cobalt(II) centers and their UV–vis spectral
patterns. Reaction of the potassium salt of allyl-TpCF3 and CoBr2·6H2O in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
yielded a blue solution. From this solution, blue crystalline solids
of a bromide complex, [CoBr(allyl-TpCF3)] (1), were obtained as the major product. In addition, a small amount
of a pale-pink compound, the homoleptic complex [Co(allyl-TpCF3)2] (2), was also obtained. The molecular
structures of 1 and 2 were determined using
X-ray crystallography (Figure 1). The geometries of the cobalt(II) centers of 1 and 2 were pseudotetrahedral and octahedral, respectively.
In both 1 and 2, the allyl-TpCF3 coordinated to the cobalt(II) centers in a facially capping tridentate
mode through three pyrazolyl nitrogen donors. No flipping from 3-CF3-pyrazolyl to 5-CF3-pyrazolyl occurred.12 The allyl groups in 1 and 2 did not coordinate to the cobalt centers, although coordination
of a boron-attached allyl group in a hybrid scorpionate ligand, [(allyl)B(pzH)2(CH2PPh2)]−, to an iridium(I) center has been reported by Camerano et al.13 Compounds 1 and 2 retained
their molecular structures when dissolved in appropriate solvents,
as indicated by the similarity of the spectral features of visible-light
absorption by the solutions (1 in CH2Cl2 and 2 in THF) and the solids. Reaction of allyl-TpCF3 with Co(OAc)2·4H2O yielded a
violet-colored compound 3, which exhibited a λmax of approximately 580 nm in both solid and solution states.14 Although attempts to obtain single crystals
suitable for X-ray analysis were not successful, compound 3 is tentatively assigned as a κ2-acetate complex
with a penta-coordinated cobalt(II) center.

2.2 Synthesis
and Characterization of Immobilized
Cobalt Complex Catalysts
Allyl-TpCF3 was anchored
onto organothiol-functionalized silica using a thiol–ene coupling
reaction. As we reported previously, the structural properties of
the support, such as the support surface morphology and the loading
density of the organic linker group, are the dominant factors controlling
the structure and performance of the resulting metallocomplex active
sites of the immobilized catalysts.15−17 Therefore, in this study,
SBA-15-type mesoporous SiO2 with controlled thiol group
(SBASH) loadings was used as the support. This support
was prepared through one-pot condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)
and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in the presence of a
polymer micelle template.16−18 The condensation ratios of TEOS
and MPTMS were controlled as TEOS:MPTMS = (100 – x):x, where x = 0.5 or 1.0. The
resultant thiol-functionalized SBA-15-type supports (SBASH(x)), which were obtained by removing the template
using Soxhlet extraction, had a desired mesoporous structure, as confirmed
by XRD analysis and N2 isotherm absorption/desorption behavior.
Remaining Si–OH groups on the surface of the mesopore walls
were end-capped by treatment with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS) at 323 K. The end-capping of the Si–OH groups led to
a decrease in the acidity and an increase in the hydrophobicity of
the silica support; these characteristics should avoid degradation
of the TpCF3 moiety through hydrolysis of the B–N
linkages. The loading amount of the thiol groups was consistent with
the value of x estimated by 1H NMR analysis
of the alkyl groups. The densities of the loaded thiol on SBASH(x) were approximately 0.06 molecules/nm2 for x = 0.5 and 0.12 molecules/nm2 for x = 1.0.

The coupling reaction of SBASH(x) with a CHCl3 solution of
allyl-TpCF3, which gave SBASH–Tp(x), was initiated by adding a small amount of AIBN under
heating. The immobilized amount of TpCF3 for SBASH–Tp(0.5) was approximately the same as the loadings of thiol groups.
For SBASH–Tp(1.0), some of the loaded thiol groups
were not connected with TpCF3. Further reaction of the
remaining thiol groups for SBASH–Tp(1.0) with additional
allyl-TpCF3 did not occur. The steric bulkiness of allyl-TpCF3 resulted in a saturation of the ligand loadings. Therefore,
to prevent the formation of thiolato complexes, the remaining thiol
groups were transformed to thioacetate ester by the reaction with
acetyl chloride and the resultant supports were named as SBASAc–Tp(x).

Reaction of the TpCF3-anchored
supports with an MeCN
solution of CoBr2·6H2O yielded the corresponding
immobilized cobalt complex catalysts Co/SBASH–Tp(x) (4; x = 0.5 and 5; x = 1.0) and Co/SBASAc–Tp(x) (4′; x =
0.5 and 5′; x = 1.0) (Scheme 1). Loading amounts
of the cobalt ion on the catalysts varied depending on the initial
SH loadings and on the state of the non-Tp-anchored sulfur groups
as SH or SAc (see Table S2). Coordination
environments of the cobalt(II) center of the immobilized complexes
were explored using diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectrophotometry;
the results are shown in Figure 2. Comparison of the spectral patterns of the immobilized
complexes and those of 1–3 in the
solid state revealed the coordination number of the cobalt(II) centers
of the immobilized complexes.

Figure 2 Diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectra of
the solid of the cobalt
complexes 1–3 (a) and the immobilized
cobalt complex catalysts with an initial thiol-loading ratio with x = 0.5 (b) and 1.0 (c).

Scheme 1 Preparation of the Supports and Catalysts
For the lower thiol loading supports (where x =
0.5), a tetrahedral cobalt(II) species was mainly formed, as suggested
by the similarity between the spectral patterns of 1 and
those of the catalysts 4 and 4′.
Although the loading amounts of cobalt and the states of the remaining
sulfur groups on 4 and 4′ were somewhat
different, the similar spectral patterns of 4 and 4′ indicated that the dispersive immobilization of
TpCF3 resulted in the formation of the tetrahedral cobalt
species.

The spectral patterns of the higher-thiol-loaded catalysts
(x = 1.0) clearly differed from that of the catalysts
with x = 0.5 and that of tetrahedral complex 1.
The spectrum of 5 (SBASH–Tp derivative)
appears to contain both hexa- and penta-coordinated cobalt(II), similar
to the mixture of 2 and 3. The cobalt loadings
on 5 were higher than the amounts of the immobilized
TpCF3 (see Table S2). Notably,
only trace amounts of cobalt were immobilized onto the reaction of
non-TpCF3-anchored support SBASH(1.0) and the
MeCN solution of CoBr2·6H2O. Therefore,
the co-existence of TpCF3 and the thiol groups would lead
to the formation of some multinuclear cobalt complexes on the support.
By contrast, the UV–vis spectrum of the SBASAc–Tp derivative 5′ suggested that the major species
was the penta-coordinate species and that small amounts of hexa- and
tetra-coordinate species also existed. From the densities of the loaded
thiol groups, their average distances were estimated to be 2.9 nm
for SBASH(1.0) and 4.1 nm for SBASH(0.5). In
such situations, the immobilized TpCF3 appears to be isolated
even on SBASH(1.0), and it might be difficult to access
the other groups (SH, SAc, and TpCF3) of the formed TpCF3Co moieties on the supports (SBASH–Tp and
SBASAc–Tp). However, the location of the immobilized
complexes was not a flat surface but a curved inner wall of the straight
pore. As a result, the distances between the functional groups and
the cobalt center of TpCF3Co were sufficiently small for
them to coordinate and form the penta-coordinate complexes. Therefore,
the structures of the immobilized complexes were affected by the structures
of the supports, the density of the organic functional groups, and
the state of the remaining sulfur donors.

We also examined Co(OAc)2·4H2O as the
metal source instead of CoBr2·6H2O (Table S2 and Figure S6). In the reaction of the non-TpCF3-immobilized support
SBASH with an MeCN solution of Co(OAc)2·4H2O, some cobalt species were anchored on the support. By contrast,
no cobalt species was anchored onto SBASH(0.5) when CoBr2·6H2O was used as a precursor. Additionally,
the reaction of SBASAc–Tp(x) with
an MeCN solution of Co(OAc)2·4H2O resulted
in the immobilized cobalt ions were in excess of the amount of the
anchored TpCF3. The spectral patterns of the cobalt species
on each of the supports [i.e., SBASH(0.5), SBASH–TpCF3(0.5 and 1.0), and SBASAc–TpCF3(0.5 and 1.0) shown
in Figure S6] varied depending on the anion
of the precursor. These different behaviors of the cobalt species
when anchoring to the functionalized supports imply that the counteranions
of cobalt(II) dominate control
of the structure of the immobilized cobalt compounds. The acetate
anions tend to become bridging ligands that yield multinuclear cobalt
species that interact with the TpCF3 and even with the
SH groups on the supports.

2.3 Correlation between the
Structure and Activity
of Immobilized Cobalt Complex Catalysts
Substrate-oxidizing
activities of the obtained immobilized cobalt complex catalysts were
examined by using cyclohexene as a substrate.

First, we compared
the activity of the catalysts prepared from CoBr2·6H2O to clarify the performance of the cobalt centers supported
by the TpCF3 scaffold. When aqueous H2O2 was used as the oxidant, the immobilized catalysts exhibited
catalase-like H2O2 degradation activity, with
the formation of O2 bubbles. On the contrary, when tert-BuOOH was used as the oxidant, catalytic allylic oxygenation
of cyclohexene occurred. No leaching of the cobalt species was observed
under these reaction conditions. The major product was dialkylperoxide
in all reactions, which indicated the reactions proceeded through
a Habor–Weiss mechanism. Similar reactivity toward cyclohexene
oxidation with tert-BuOOH has been observed on a
cobalt-based MOF catalyst.19 The turnover
number (TON) order of the cobalt centers was 4′ > 5′ > 4 > 5 > 1 (homogeneous conditions). It is worth noting
that the immobilized
TpCF3Co complex catalysts exhibited higher activity compared
with the homogeneous cobalt species derived from genuine cobalt(II)
salts (CoBr2·6H2O and Co(OAc)2·4H2O; Table S3). The
higher activities of the immobilized catalysts are attributed to the
suppression of bimolecular reactions that lead to catalyst decomposition.
The differences in the TONs of the immobilized catalysts indicate
that the structures of the cobalt centers affect the catalytic efficiencies.
The most active catalyst was 4′, which was composed
of isolated TpCF3Co sites without free thiol groups. The
remaining thiol groups suppress the catalytic activity, as clearly
demonstrated by comparisons with the activities of 5 and 5′. The lowest activity of 5 suggests
that the hexa-coordinated cobalt center is less reactive than the
coordinatively unsaturated tetra- and penta-coordinated cobalt species
formed on the other immobilized catalysts. Catalyst 5′, the second-most active catalyst, exhibited better selectivity toward
epoxidation than that observed for 4′ (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Cyclohexene oxidation
with TBHP catalyzed by the compounds derived
from CoBr2·6H2O. TONs were estimated on
the basis of the oxidizing equivalent of the products according to
the following equation: TON = (cyclohexene oxide (E)
+ cyclohexen-1-ol (A) + 2 × cyclohexen-1-one (K) + tert-butyl-cyclohexenyl-1-peroxide (P))/cobalt.

The activities of the
immobilized cobalt complex catalysts derived
from Co(OAc)2·4H2O were also examined (Table S3). The non-TpCF3-coordinated
cobalt species formed on SBASH also exhibited better activity
and epoxidation selectivity. In the catalysts derived from Co(OAc)2·4H2O, the supports of the most active and
the second-most active catalysts were SBASAc–TpCF3(0.5) and SBASH–TpCF3(1.0), respectively. Trends
of the product selectivity of these catalysts were similar to those
observed for 4′ and 5′ (derived
from CoBr2·6H2O). The catalysts supported
on the highly dispersed TpCF3 (i.e., x = 0.5) exhibited a strong radical character that is sufficient to
induce the oxygenation of the allylic position. For the catalysts
formed on the support with higher loadings of TpCF3 and
thiol (i.e., x = 1.0), a small increase in epoxide
selectivity was observed. Therefore, the local structure of the functionalized
supports might be a controlling factor for the structures and activities
of the metal centers. In the case of the cobalt-acetate-based catalysts,
however, the nature of acetate makes selective formation of the isolated
cobalt centers supported by TpCF3 difficult.

3 Conclusions
The boron-functionalized scorpionate ligand
was successfully immobilized
onto mesoporous silica through covalent bonds. The structures of the
formed cobalt(II) complexes and their catalytic activities depended
on the density of the organic thiol groups and on the state of the
remaining sulfur donors on the inner wall of the mesopores. Additionally,
the nature of the anions of the metal sources was a dominant factor
affecting the structures of the immobilized metallocomplexes. As demonstrated
herein, cobalt(II) is an efficient probe for estimating the structures
of the immobilized species.

4.1 Materials and Methods
All solvents
used for the synthesis of the ligand and catalytic reaction (THF,
toluene, CH2Cl2, and MeCN) were purified over
a Glass Contour Solvent Dispending System under an Ar atmosphere.
Other reagents of the highest grade that were commercially available
were used without further purification. Atomic absorption analysis
was performed on a Shimadzu AA-6200. Elemental analysis was performed
on a Perkin-Elmer CHNS/O Analyzer 2400II. GC analysis was performed
on a Shimadzu GC2010 gas chromatograph with an Rtx-5 column (Restek,
length = 30 m, i.d. = 0.25 mm, and thickness = 0.25 μm). IR
spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR 4200 spectrometer. NMR spectra
were recorded on a JEOL ECA-600 spectrometer. UV–vis spectra
of solution samples were recorded on a JASCO V650 spectrometer, and
solid reflectance spectra were recorded on the same instrument with
a PIN-757 integrating sphere attachment for solid. Nitrogen sorption
studies were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using
Micromeritics TriStar 3000. Before the adsorption experiments, the
samples were outgassed under reduced pressure for 3 h at 333 K.

4.2 Synthesis of Potassium Salt of Allyltris(3-triluoromethylpyrazol-1-yl)borate
(=[K(allyl-TpCF3)])
Potassium salt of 3-trifluoromethylpyrazole
(=pzCF3K) was obtained by the condensation reaction of
KOH (0.33 g, 5.0 mmol) with pzCF3H (0.68 g, 5.0 mmol) in
dry methanol (30 mL) at ambient temperature for 1 h and the volatiles
were removed by evaporation. The obtained white solids of pzCF3K, pzCF3H (2.66 g, 19.0 mmol), and allyldiisopropoxyborane
(=B(allyl)(OiPr)2; 1.0 mL, 4.89 mmol) were dissolved in
toluene (125 mL) and refluxed for 24 h using Dean–Stark equipment.
Crude products obtained by evaporation were washed with pentane. An
analytically pure product was obtained as a pale yellow solid (0.60
g, 26% yield). 1H NMR (C3D6O, rt):
δ (ppm) = 2.40 (d, 2H, CH2=CHCH2−), 4.46–4.70 (dd, 2H, CH2=CHCH2−), 5.92 (m, 1H, CH2=CHCH2−), 6.39 (s,
3H, pz-4H), and 7.34 (s, 3H, pz-5H). 13C NMR (THF-d8, rt): δ
(ppm) = 30.30 (CH2=CHCH2−), 102.16 (pz-4C), 112.54 (CH2=CHCH2−), 120.24–125.56
(CF3), 135.28 (pz-5C),

4.3 Reaction of [K(allyl-TpCF3)] and
CoBr2·6H2O (Formation of [CoIIBr(allyl-TpCF3)] (1) and [CoII(allyl-TpCF3)2] (2))
A THF (100 mL) solution of [K(allyl-TpCF3)] (1.00 g, 2.02
mmol) was added slowly to CoBr2·6H2O (0.529
g, 2.42 mmol) dissolved in THF (90 mL) at ambient temperature. After
stirring for 1 h, volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The
resultant solids were suspended in pentane and then decanted. The
resultant solids were dissolved in CH2Cl2, and
insoluble materials were removed by filtration through a Celite plug.
From the filtrate, the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure,
and the resultant solids were dissolved in a mixture of CH2Cl2 and n-hexane. Refrigeration of this
solution at 243 K afforded a small amount of pale yellow crystalline
solids of the homoleptic complex 2. After the removal
of 2 by filtration, the resultant solution was concentrated
and stored at 243 K, yielding a blue powder of the desired bromide
complex 1 (220 mg, 0.369 mmol, 18% yield). 1H NMR (CDCl3, rt): δ (ppm) = 47.00 (s, 3H, pz-4H) and 68.19 (s, 3H, pz-5H). IR (KBr): νC–H = 3263 cm–1; νB–C = 1260 cm–1. ESI-TOF MS (MeOH solution, positive

A THF
(90 mL) solution of [K(allyl-TpCF3)] (0.870 g, 1.75 mmol)
was added slowly to an MeOH (60 mL) solution of Co(OAc)2·4H2O (0.371 g, 2.10 mmol) at ambient temperature.
After stirring for 1 h, volatiles were removed under reduced pressure.
The resultant solids were suspended in pentane and then decanted.
The resultant solids were dissolved in CH2Cl2, and insoluble materials were removed by filtration through a Celite
plug. From the filtrate, the volatiles were removed under reduced
pressure, and purple species were obtained from the resultant solids
by extraction with MeCN. From this solution, MeCN was removed by evaporation,
and the resultant solids were dissolved in a mixture of CH2Cl2 and n-hexane. Refrigeration of this
solution at 243 K yielded reddish purple solids of 3.
IR (KBr): νC–H = 3161 cm–1; νC=O = 1605 cm–1; νB–C = 1258 cm–1. UV–vis (CH2Cl2, rt): λ (nm (M–1 cm–1)) = 561 (56).

4.5 Preparation
of SBASH(x)
Thiol-functionalized
mesoporous silica supports (=SBASH(x))
were prepared by a similar manner for
the previously reported organoazide-functionalized SBA-15 by Nakazawa
and Stack.18 Condensation ratio of mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane
(=MPTMS; x mol % of Si) and tetraethoxysilane (=TEOS;
(100 – x) mol % of Si) were defined as x = 0.5 or 1. In a flask, 8.0 g of the surfactant Pluronic
P123 [=triblock copolymer EO20PO70EO20, where EO = poly(ethylene glycol) and PO = poly(propylene glycol)]
was placed and then dissolved in 260 mL of water with 40 mL of conc.
HCl solution (35 wt %) by stirring at 313 K for 4 h. To the resultant
solution, 18.4 mL (81.3 mmol) of TEOS and appropriate amounts of MPTMS
(76.0 μL when x = 0.5 or 155 μL when x = 1.0) were added. The mixture was stirred at 323 K for
24 h and subsequently heated at 363 K for 24 h. Once cooled, the solid
product was filtered and washed with deionized H2O and
EtOH. The P123 surfactant was removed using Soxhlet extraction with
a mixture of 200 mL of H2O and 200 mL of EtOH over 24 h.
The resultant white solid was dried under vacuum. Then the remaining
silanol groups on the as-prepared thiol-functionalized SBA-15 were
end-capped by the trimethylsilyl group. A suspension of the dried
solid of the precursor of SBASH(x) (5.4
g) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (=HMDS; 10 mL) in toluene
(100 mL) was stirred at 323 K for 1 h. The resultant solid was collected
by filtration then washed with toluene and CH2Cl2. Dryness under evacuation yielded 5.3 g of end-capped support, namely,
SBASH(x). Loading amounts of the thiol
groups were determined using 1H NMR spectrometry as follows:
10 mg of SBASH(x) was dissolved in 2 mL
of D2O solution containing a small amount of NaOH under
heating. To this solution, 10 mg (0.072 mmol) of p-nitrophenol was added as an internal standard. The loading amounts
of the thiol groups were estimated by a comparison of the integration
values of 1H NMR signals of ethylene and phenyl groups.

4.6 Preparation of SBASH–Tp(x)
To a suspension of SBASH(x) (2.0 g) in CHCl3 (30 mL), [K(allyl-TpCF3)] (180 mg, 0.38 mmol) and AIBN (10 mg) were added. The
resultant mixture was refluxed for 6 h. The white solid of SBASH–Tp was obtained by filtration. The resultant solid
was washed with CHCl3 and then dried under evacuation.
The loading amounts of Tp were estimated from the contents of nitrogen
(wt % of N) using CHN elemental analysis (data are shown in Table S2).

4.7 Preparation
of SBASAc–Tp(x)
In 30
mL of toluene, an appropriate
amount of SBASH–Tp(x) was suspended.
To this suspension, acetyl chloride (2.0 equiv with respect to the
loading amounts of thiol) and DBU (2.5 equiv) were added, and the
resultant mixture was refluxed for 6 h. The white filtrates of SBASAc–Tp(x) were washed with toluene
and then dried under evacuation.

4.8 Preparation
of Catalysts
In 20 mL
of CH2Cl2, 0.20 g of the support [SBASH–Tp(x) or SBASAc–Tp(x)] was suspended. To this suspension, an acetonitrile (10 mL) solution
of CoBr2·6H2O (13 mg, 0.039 mmol) was added,
and the resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h.
Filtration, washing with MeCN and methanol, and then drying under
evacuation yielded a pale blue solid of the catalysts Co/SBASH–Tp(x) (4 (x = 0.5) and 5 (x = 1.0)) or Co/SBASAc–Tp(x) (4′ (x =
0.5) and 5′ (x = 1.0)). Loading
amounts of cobalt on the catalysts were determined as follows. The
catalyst (10 mg) was dissolved into 1 mL of aqueous solution of KOH
(0.04 g/mL) under heating. Then, the solution was acidified with 2
mL of conc. aq. HNO3 and diluted with H2O to
50 mL volume. The solution was passed through syringe filter before
being introduced into an atomic absorption spectrometer.

4.9 Catalytic Reactions
Typical procedure
for the heterogeneous reaction is as follows: In Schlenk flask, an
appropriate amount of the catalyst (1 μmol cobalt on the immobilized
catalyst) was suspended in 5 mL of MeCN. Cyclohexene (0.25 mL, 2.5
mmol), nitrobenzene (10 μL, 0.10 mmol; as internal standard),
and 70 wt % aqueous tert-BuOOH (2.5 mmol) were added
to this suspension. All reactions were carried under Ar, and the products
were analyzed using GC with an internal standard.
