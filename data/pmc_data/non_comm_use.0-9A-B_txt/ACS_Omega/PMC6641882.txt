This article describes the stabilization
and postsynthetic separation
of gold nanostars (AuNS) synthesized with a morpholine-based Good’s
buffer, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. Resuspension
of AuNS in ultrapure water improved the shape stability of the particles
over 30 days. We demonstrated the sorting of nanostars via rate-zonal
centrifugation through a linear sucrose gradient based on branch length
and number. We determined that one round of centrifugation was sufficient
for separation. Also, we improved the structural homogeneity and stability
of the nanoparticles through the optimization of the storage conditions
and established a robust method to sort AuNS based on size and shape.

Introduction
The physical and chemical
properties of anisotropic gold nanoparticles
are controlled by their dimension and shape.1 Gold nanostars (AuNS) are high-performing substrate materials for
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,2−6 photothermal therapy,7 and photoacoustic
imaging8 because they exhibit strong electric
field enhancements on multiple sharp tips.9 AuNS are of interest among anisotropic nanoparticles because minor
shape modifications, such as aspect ratio and branch length,10,11 enable tunability of the localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances.2,8,12,13 Accessing specific structural features of AuNS has driven synthetic
techniques that can control the chemical environment by introducing
different reactants.14−16 Typically, AuNS are prepared by seed-mediated syntheses;17,18 however, these methods require strongly bound, cytotoxic surfactants
that limit the biological applications. A commonly used seedless synthesis
method for AuNS that avoids additional surfactants only involves two
precursors: a Au salt (HAuCl4) and a biocompatible Good’s
buffer, usually 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid
(HEPES).10,13,19−21 Good’s buffer acts as both a reducing and shape-directing
agent, with the ethane sulfonate group of HEPES binding to the Au
surface and the hydroxyl group facilitating the assembly and bilayer
formation to stabilize the AuNS.21 Recently,
we reported the preparation of AuNS with disparate branch lengths,
branch tips with a small radius of curvature (3–5 nm), and
multiple LSP resonances in the near-infrared (NIR) and second NIR
window using a Good’s buffer with a morpholine ring, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS).11

To exploit the unique structural properties of MOPS
AuNS, challenges
specific to the buffer must be overcome: (1) the morpholine moiety
degrades once exposed to HAuCl4, which causes colloidal
instability;22 and (2) MOPS cannot form
a stable bilayer without a hydroxyl group, which leads to heterogeneous
solutions.21 Adjusting the synthetic conditions
is a common strategy to obtain stable and homogeneous Au nanoparticle
solutions, but exquisite control over room-temperature reaction conditions
is limited;23 hence, postsynthetic separation
offers an approach to obtain purer solutions of anisotropic particles.
Centrifugation,24 size-exclusion chromatography,25 filtration or diafiltration,26,27 and electrophoresis28 have been used
to produce metal nanoparticle solutions with narrow shape and size
distributions. In particular, density gradient centrifugation (DGC)
is a postsynthetic sorting technique that can refine the structural
distributions of metal nanoparticles by rate-zonal separation.29 In this method, the sorting of particles primarily
depends on the sedimentation rate, which is a function of their size
and shape. Standard gradient media are deleterious to anisotropic
metallic nanoparticles with weakly bound surface ligands;30 however, sucrose shows excellent compatibility.31,32

Here, we describe a strategy to obtain highly enriched populations
of AuNS by combining the stabilization and sorting processes. We improved
the homogeneity of MOPS AuNS and reduced the percentage of unwanted
spherical byproducts by adjusting the storage conditions. By centrifuging
the as-synthesized, unsorted mixtures through a sucrose density gradient,
we isolated the solutions of AuNS based on branch length and number.
We demonstrated that only a single round of DGC was needed to sort
AuNS solutions by size and shape; an additional round did not significantly
improve separation of the sorted samples.

Results and Discussion
Establishing
MOPS AuNS Stability
Scheme 1 summarizes the stabilization and separation
of heterogeneous MOPS AuNS populations. AuNS solutions stored in ultrapure,
deionized water maintained the shape integrity compared with those
stored in the MOPS buffer. To overcome particle heterogeneity, we
sorted the AuNS first by layering a concentrated solution on top of
a sucrose density gradient and then performing DGC. In the subsequent
rounds of DGC, the original (O) fractions were concentrated and centrifuged
through a shallow linear gradient.

Scheme 1 Stabilization and Separation of MOPS
AuNS
AuNS were synthesized using
a modified version of our previously
established procedure11 with 150 mM of
the Good’s buffer MOPS and 0.2 nM HAuCl4 (Methods). We selected these conditions because this
MOPS concentration produced AuNS with two distinct LSP peaks (Figure 1). The as-synthesized
solutions were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy to measure
the bulk optical properties, and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was used to visualize individual AuNS. The 0 min time point
indicates an unstirred solution after the addition of HAuCl4. After 1 min of vortexing, one LSP peak at shorter wavelengths,
λ1, formed between 700 and 750 nm (Figure 1a). Throughout the reaction,
a LSP peak at longer wavelengths, λ2, formed at 800
nm and red shifted to ca. 1100 nm. After 24 h, both LSP peaks blue
shifted and decreased in absorbance as the 520 nm LSP peak intensity
increased (Figures 1b and S1), possibly due to a decrease
in the particle size and the average branch length, as well as an
increase in the number of spherical particles (Table S1). We hypothesize that the MOPS buffer was displaced
from the surface of the particles, which resulted in a change in the
shape.

Figure 1 Peak absorbance of MOPS AuNS in growth solution blue shifted over
30 days. (a) The absorbance was measured 24 h (red line) after the
addition of HAuCl4 up to 30 days (black line) in 5 day
increments. (b) TEM images of MOPS AuNS after 1, 15, or 30 days after
the addition of HAuCl4.

Exchanging Solvent Storage Conditions
In an earlier
work, we observed that the AuNS synthesized with MOPS transformed
into spheres over 12 days when stored in the buffer growth solution.11 Here, we resuspended the as-synthesized solution
in ultrapure water either one (1× solution) or two (2× solution)
times (Figure 2). We
tracked the changes in bulk optical properties at the two LSP peaks
to determine whether AuNS’s shape changed; within the first
5 days, λ1 and λ2 blue shifted by
15 nm for 1× and 2× solutions. After 10 days, the LSP resonances
of the 2× solution did not change, and the branch lengths decreased
only minimally (by 5 ± 3 nm). Larger AuNS (>80 nm) remained
in
the solution over 30 days compared with the as-synthesized particles.
The LSP peaks of the 1× solution, however, shifted to shorter
wavelengths by an additional 10 and 20 nm, and the particle size decreased.
The percentage of spherical particles increased for the 1× solution
from 35 to 47, whereas the percentage remained the same for the 2×
solution. We hypothesize that exchanging buffered growth solutions
for ultrapure water stabilized AuNS, in contrast to similar systems
that are stabilized by the excess buffer solution because excess MOPS
degrades over time in the presence of Au salt.33

and two (red) resuspensions. Filled markers correspond to the λ1 peak and open markers correspond to the λ2 peak. (b) TEM images of AuNS 30 days after one or two resuspensions

Comparing Linear and Step
Gradients
Even with improved
storage conditions, MOPS AuNS solutions still contained ca. 37% undesirable
spherical particles. Because the as-synthesized AuNS showed a broad
distribution of shapes (0–8 branches) and sizes (20–80
nm),11 we used DGC to sort branched nanoparticles.30 We compared two different types of gradient
densities: linear and step (Figure 3). A linear gradient contains a single continuous zone,
whereas a step gradient has multiple density zones. Both gradients
can enrich the solutions by sorting the nanoparticles into distinct
bands.29 Changing the gradient composition
and centrifugation time can improve both dispersion through the gradient
and the nanoparticle yield. Because sorting of particles with similar
sizes but different shapes requires a shallow gradient (10%),30 we started with an 50–60% (w/v) gradient
of sucrose.

Figure 3 Linear gradient allows for a greater separation than step gradient.
The control (no AuNS) was used to establish the linear and step gradients
and contained the coloring agent Trypan blue. Once the gradients were
established, AuNS were centrifuged through a gradient without Trypan
blue (sorted AuNS). A linear gradient with an increasing viscosity
and density produced two bands: a red one and a blue one. The particles
had a greater spatial separation over a step gradient. The step gradient
produced two bands, but the particles were not
further separated within the bands.

To monitor the gradients, we added a standard coloring agent,
Trypan
blue, to the denser 60% (w/v) solution. For the linear gradient, the
dense, blue solution was layered below the clear 50% (w/v) solution.
Using a custom mixing program (Methods), the
two sucrose solutions were mixed at an angle without AuNS to create
a continuous linear gradient (Figure 3, control (no AuNS)). We determined the linearity of
the sucrose gradients by fractionating the control gradient and calculated
the concentration of sucrose in each fraction using the following
equation34 1  where ci is the concentration of sucrose
at point i, x is the concentration
of the heavier solution
(60%), y is the concentration of the lighter solution
(50%), and Afn is the absorbance of fraction n, and A60% is the absorbance
of 60% sucrose dye. The concentration of sucrose over the gradient
was linear and contained an r2 value of
0.9998. For the step gradient, we layered five different density sucrose
solutions: 50, 52.5, 55, 57.5, and 60% (w/v).

We created linear
and step gradients without Trypan blue and then
layered 500 μL of AuNS solutions (8–10 nM) and centrifuged
samples at 4400g (Figure 3, sorted AuNS). DGC is limited intrinsically
by the volume of the sample that can be layered on top of the gradient;35 however, we found that the starting concentration
of the layered sample had no effect on the degree of separation (Figure S2). In the linear gradient, two distinct
bands were formed: (1) a thin red band of spherical nanoparticles
and (2) a long blue/gray band of sorted AuNS. TEM analysis verified
that the red band contained 80–85% spherical nanoparticles
and the blue/gray band enriched the populations of AuNS. For the step
gradient, centrifugation of AuNS produced bands in the top three zones
and resulted in the reduced spreading of the particle distributions
compared with the linear gradient. Moreover, each step gradient band
contained nanoparticles with mixed particle shapes and size. Hence,
the linear density gradients can separate similarly sized nanoparticles
with small structural differences (i.e., AuNS with varying branch
length and number), and step gradients are more useful for sorting
a few, distinct populations of nanoparticles.

Characterizing Separation
of AuNS in a Linear Gradient
After centrifuging AuNS through
the linear gradient, the samples
were fractionated at intervals of 4 mm from the meniscus 30 times
(Methods). The corresponding fractions were
collected in different tubes and labeled F1–F30. F1 indicates
the top-most fraction and F30 is the bottom-most fraction. We found
that the best separation of particles without forming a pellet at
the bottom occurred for the centrifugation times of 1.5 h at 4400g (Figure 4a). To characterize sorted AuNS fractions (F1–F30), we measured
the absorbance spectra and correlated the optical properties with
TEM images (Figure 4b–c). Fractions F1–F4 produced a peak only at 520 nm,
which corresponded with spherical nanoparticles. Fractions F5–F19
contained AuNS with a LSP at λ1 between 700 and 720
nm with a high-intensity absorbance (>0.3), which was the minimum
absorbance needed to image the particles and the bulk optical properties.
The second LSP at λ2 shifted from 800 to 1150 nm
in fractions F5–F19; this shift indicated an increase in the
branch length. In fractions >F19, the absorbance decreased by half,
which indicated a low concentration of particles. Although particles
with the same mass or shape may have comparable sedimentation rates,
sorted AuNS showed improved particle homogeneity in each fraction.30

sucrose gradient. (b) Absorbance spectra for every odd-numbered fraction
from F5 to F23. (c) Representative TEM images from F5, F13, and F17
show branched particles in all of the different fractions.

Sorting AuNS by Branch Length and Number
To quantify
particle size, branch length, and branch number of AuNS, more than
500 branches of every other fraction from F5 to F19 were analyzed
manually by ImageJ (Figures 5a and S3). (We omitted F1–F4
because they contained mostly spherical particles.) For fractions
F5–F19, the average tip-to-tip particle size increased from
21 ± 5 to 100 ± 17 nm, which also corresponded with an increase
in the branch length from 18 ± 10 to 32 ± 18 nm (Figure 5b). We observed two
populations of AuNS: shorter (<30 nm) and longer (>30 nm) branched
particles. In all of the fractions, most branches were less than 30
nm. With an increase in the fraction number, the number of short branches
decreased as the number of long branches increased. In fractions F5–F11,
the population consisted of particles that had lower masses and hence
remained closer to the top of the density gradient. In higher fractions
F13–F19, AuNS had longer branches with larger particle sizes
and greater mass per particle.

odd-numbered fractions in F5–F19. (b) The number of branches
that are short (<30 nm) or long (>30 nm) for each fraction.

Rate-zonal separation efficiency
depends on the particle shape
or the number of branches (0–8) per particle (Figure 6). We categorized the fractions
into branch number populations: spheres (0), low (1–2), medium
(3–4), and high (>5). We observed a decrease in the percentage
of spheres from 20 to <1% from F5 to F13. This low percentage of
spheres (<1% of the population) remained in fractions F13–F19,
which created highly enriched populations of branched AuNS. Each fraction
showed greater particle homogeneity than the as-synthesized solutions.
From fractions F5 to F19, high branch number populations increased,
whereas low branch numbers decreased. Particles with greater number
of branches, longer branches, and larger sizes tended to sediment
to the bottom of the gradient. These characteristic differences between
spherical nanoparticles and heterogeneous AuNS allowed for sorting
based on nanoscale structural features.

and AuNS branch number population

of branches. The dimensions of all of the images are 150 nm ×
200 nm. (b) The percentage of the AuNS population that have low (1–2),
medium (3–4), or high (>5) number of branches.

Separating AuNS through a Second Round of
Centrifugation and
Fractionation
To achieve more refined populations of AuNS,
we processed the original (O) fractions by DGC for a second time (Figure 7a). During round
1 of DGC, the AuNS dispersed throughout the top half of the tube;
therefore, for round 2, we created a second linear 50–55% (w/v)
sucrose gradient. AuNS in the top (T), middle (M), and bottom (B)
regions of the gradient were analyzed for the number of branches per
particle, but no differences were found between the three fractions
compared with the original population (Figure 7b). We found that a single round of rate-zonal
DGC efficiently enriched AuNS populations based on the differences
in size and shape, and additional rounds did not improve the particle
homogeneity.

Figure 7 Round 2 of DGC fractions did not enrich branch populations.
(a)
Odd-numbered original fractions were layered on top of a 50–55
wt % sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 45 min at 4400g. Top (T), middle (M), and bottom (B) fractions of the each of the
round 2 fractionated samples were collected. (b) The branch number
distribution for each of the T, M, and B samples was analyzed manually.
The population distribution was similar among the original fractions
(O) and the refractionated samples.

Conclusions
In summary, we established techniques to
stabilize and separate
the heterogeneous solutions of AuNS synthesized with a morpholine-based
Good’s buffer. The modified storage conditions can be generalized
to other metal nanoparticles that change shape in solution over time.
We found that linear gradients are better suited to sort similarly
sized particles with small differences, such as branch length and
number. The robust techniques described herein can produce highly
enriched populations of anisoptropic nanoparticles that can be exploited
for different shape-dependent applications, such as surface-enhanced
spectroscopies, sensing of chemical and biological analytes, bioimaging,
and therapeutics.

Methods
Gold Nanostar Synthesis
The Good’s buffer used
was 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS buffer,
Sigma Aldrich). The 1 M stock MOPS solution was made by dissolving
the buffer salt in Millipore water (18.2 MΩ cm) using a medium-sized
stir bar to ensure thorough mixing. The pH of the MOPS solution was
measured using a Thermo Scientific pH meter and was adjusted using
the concentrated solutions of NaOH. For fine pH adjustments, HCl was
added dropwise.

AuNS were synthesized by adding 0.2 mM (final
concentration) gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4; Sigma
Aldrich) to 150 mM of MOPS buffer. Each solution was vortexed in a
50 mL Falcon tube for 1 min before the addition of HAuCl4 and for 1–5 min afterward. After vortexing, the growth solution
was left undisturbed at room temperature for 24 h. The 0 min time
point indicates an unstirred growth solution after the addition of
HAuCl4.

Particle Characterization Techniques
AuNS solution
(3 mL) was placed in a 1 cm plastic Brookhaven cuvette, and the absorbance
spectra were measured from 400 to 1400 nm using a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies).

For TEM grid preparation,
carbon Type B, 300 mesh copper grids (Ted Pella) were treated with
0.1% (w/v) poly-l-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min. Then,
40 μL of 10× concentrated Au nanoparticle solution was
left to rest on the treated grids for 30–60 s and then wicked
away with filter paper. A JEOL 1230 TEM was used for imaging the particles.
The representative images were collected from different areas of the
grid. Structural features, such as circularity and Feret diameter,
were characterized using the Analyze Particles plugin on ImageJ for
at least 500 particles per sample. A circularity threshold of 0.9
was used to define spherical particles, and the Feret diameter corresponds
to the largest tip-to-tip distance on a particle. The branch length
was measured manually from the tip to the base of the branch.

Density
Gradient Centrifugation
Linear sucrose density
gradients were formed using a gradient maker (BioComp Instruments)
with 9 mL starting solutions of 50 and 60% w/v sucrose in water. A
custom mixing program alternated five times between the following
two steps: (1) time: 5 s, angle: 76, speed: 30 rpm; (2) time: 15 s,
angle: 76, speed: 0 rpm. Step gradients were layered by hand using
solutions of 50, 52.5, 55, 57.5, and 60% w/v sucrose in water. For
the first round of DGC, 500 μL of a concentrated solution of
bare AuNS (8–10 nM) was layered on top of the density gradient
in an Ultra-Clear SW28 centrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter) and then
centrifuged at 4400g for 90 min using a Thermo Fisher
Scientific Sorvall Legend XT 120 v Benchtop centrifuge. The samples
were fractionated at intervals of 4 mm from the meniscus (BioComp
Instruments). Each fraction was dialyzed in Thermo Fisher 20K Slide-A-Lyzer
Dialysis Cassettes for 24 h to remove sucrose from the solution.

For round 2 of DGC, we repeated round 1 DGC 20 times and the odd-numbered
fractions were combined to form 400 μL of 8–10 nM solution.
We collected each fraction over the 20 individual rounds of DGC and
analyzed the final distributions of branch number and length of the
combined fractions. Each of the combined fractions was layered on
top of a linear 50–55% (w/v) sucrose gradient and the centrifugation
time was set at 45 min at 4400g. We note that the
reproducibility and scalability of this technique are demonstrated
by the uniformity of the fractions that were combined from 20 rounds
of DGC.
