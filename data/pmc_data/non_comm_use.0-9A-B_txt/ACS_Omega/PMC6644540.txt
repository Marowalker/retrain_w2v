An
active in situ-generated Nb complex was used as a catalyst in
the ring-closing metathesis reaction of N,N-diallyl-p-toluenesulfonamide to afford
the corresponding 3-pyrroline derivative. The Nb complex was formed
from NbCl5, trimethylsilyl chloride, Zn, and PhCHCl2 in tetrahydrofuran. The Nb complex displayed high catalytic
activity toward ring-closing metathesis reactions.

Introduction
Olefin metathesis reactions
are useful in organic syntheses. Ring-closing
metathesis (RCM), in particular, is a powerful tool for the synthesis
of numerous ring systems, including heterocyclic, polycyclic, medium-membered
ring, and macrocyclic compounds from diolefins.1 RCM has, therefore, been used in the synthesis of a wide-range
of materials, such as drugs, functional materials, and natural products.2 Generally, metathesis reactions are catalyzed
by carbene complexes, such as the Schrock Mo-carbene complex (a)3a and the Grubbs Ru-carbene
complexes (b and c)3 (Scheme 1). Research
efforts with the aim of generating new and improved metathesis catalysts
remain a significant interest. Likewise, studies of metathesis reactions
catalyzed by early transition metals have been reported.4a Schrock reported a high oxidation state Ta and
Nb-alkylidene complex (d) in the 1970s.4

Scheme 1 Various Carbene Complexes and Carbene Precursors
The Mashima group reported
the development of metathesis catalysts
based on Ta and Nb. The precatalysts e and f have been reported to show catalytic activity toward ring-opening
metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene.5a−5e Nakayama et al. reported a system, in which an (aryloxy)tantalum
or (aryloxy)niobium complex, in the presence of a trialkylaluminum
co-catalyst, demonstrated catalytic activity in ROMP.5 Galletti reported the ROMP reaction of norbornene catalyzed
by niobium(V) N,N-dialkylcarbamates
in the presence of methylaluminoxane.5h Recently, Veige et al. and Nomura et al. reported ROMP reactions
catalyzed by a Nb-dineophyl complex with a [CF3-ONO]3 trianionic pincer-type ligand5i and the (imido)niobium-alkylidene complex Nb(CHSiMe3)(2,6-Me2C6H3N)[OC(CF3)3](PMe3)2,5j respectively.
Bruno et al. used a niobium-imido complex as a catalyst for imine
metathesis.5k However, synthesis of these
catalysts requires multiple steps, including a thermally unstable
step. Niobium-catalyzed RCM reactions have been less studied, and
no examples have been reported.

RCM reactions catalyzed by the
Tebbe reagent or Petasis reagent,
which are titanium-based methylenation reagents, have been reported.6a,6b Takai reported the olefination of a carbonyl group using a titanium–zinc
system, i.e., the Takai–Lombardo reaction (Scheme 2).6 This complex has also been employed as a precatalyst in RCM.6g However, elucidation of the structure of the
active species is required.

Scheme 2 Olefination of Carbonyl Groups Using
a Titanium-Based Complex
Niobium has multiple oxidation states, and numerous niobium
complexes
have been reported. Niobium catalysts have therefore received increasing
attention in organic syntheses.7 Our recent
studies have demonstrated that niobium displays a high affinity for
unsaturated bonds, such as olefin and alkyne bonds. In particular,
low-valent niobium exhibits high catalytic activity toward cycloaddition
reactions of alkynes with alkenes or nitriles.7d−7i High-valent niobium possesses strong Lewis acidity.7j−7l

In this study, Nb-based active species were generated in situ
from
niobium pentachloride. These materials catalyzed the RCM reactions
of diallylic compounds quantitatively to yield various ring products.
Additionally, the reactions proceeded via a one-step process.

Results
and Discussion
The RCM of N,N-diallyl-p-toluenesulfonamide was initially investigated
as a model
substrate to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 1). When a mixture of niobium pentachloride,8 trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl), Zn, benzyl dichloride,
and N,N-diallyl-p-toluenesulfonamide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was heated at 60 °C
for 2 h, the desired RCM product 1-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-3-pyrroline
was isolated in 94% yield (Table 1, entry 1). The metathesis reaction also proceeded
efficiently in the presence of NbCl4(THF)2 or
NbCl3(DME) catalyst precursor (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). It was possible to reduce
the amount of Zn when NbCl3(DME) was used (Table 1, entry 5). When substituting
NbCl5 for Nb(OEt)5 catalyst, the RCM product
yield was slightly lower, i.e., 91% (Table 1, entry 6). However, in the case of NbF5, the RCM product yield decreased significantly (Table 1, entry 7). Alternative
metal chlorides, including TaCl5, TiCl4, and
FeCl3, were also investigated; however, the desired RCM
products were not obtained (Table 1, entries 8–10). The reaction did not proceed
in the absence of a catalyst precursor (Table 1, entry 11). These results demonstrate that
this catalytic transformation is specific for niobium-based catalysts.
The reaction in the absence of TMSCl failed (Table 1, entry 12). In situ activation of zinc dust
using TMSCl in THF has reported only a limited number of reactions,9 such as the Reformatsky reaction.9g

a Reaction conditions: 1a (1 mmol), catalyst (0.1 mmol), trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl, 0.5
mmol), Zn (1.5 mmol), additive (0.5 mmol), and THF (3 mL) at 60 °C
for 2 h.

b Conversions and

by gas chromatography (GC); the number in parentheses shows the isolated
yield.

k Substituting

m Reaction temperature
40 °C.

n At room temperature
(ca. 22 °C).

Herein,
the influence of solvents is also presented. When substituting
THF for MeTHF, the desired RCM product was obtained, but in a lower
yield, i.e., 60% (Table 1, entry 13). However, the use of dioxane afforded only trace quantities
of the desired product (Table 1, entry 14).

Tetrahydropyran (THP), toluene, and 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) are
not suitable solvents, even in the presence of NbCl4(THF)2 (Table 1,
entries 15–18). Notably, the replacement of Zn with Mn or Mg
led to considerably decreased yields, which is attributed to a failure
to form the organometallic compound and reduction of NbCl5 (Table 1, entries
19 and 20).

The investigations herein also examined the effects
of reaction
temperature. The reaction proceeded quantitatively at 40 °C and
at room temperature (Table 1, entries 21 and 22). Furthermore, the reaction progress was
examined at 60 °C to determine reproducibility.

When employing
PhCH2Cl as a carbene precursor as a substitute
to PhCHCl2, the reaction afforded 1,2-diphenylethane as
a byproduct, with the desired RCM product not observed (Table 1, entry 23). Additionally, the
use of PhCCl3 led to the formation of α,α′-dichlorostilbene
and not the desired RCM product (Table 1, entry 24). When subjected to the model reaction conditions,
stilbene formed as a dimer because of organozinc compound or a possible
carbene complex formation during the reaction (vide infra, Scheme 6). When TMSCl, Zn,
THF, and PhCHCl2 were reacted at 60 °C for 2 h, stilbene
was obtained in 66% yield (Scheme 3), demonstrating that the organozinc compound dimerized
yielding stilbene.9c

Substrate effect and
limitations were examined using a variety
of dienes under optimized conditions (Table 2). First, the steric effects were investigated
using N-allyl-N-(2-methylallyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide (1b), N,N-di(2-methylallyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide
(1c), and N-allyl-N-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide (1d). When one side of the diene possessed bulky constituents,
i.e., 1b and 1d, the corresponding pyrroline
derivatives were obtained quantitatively. However, diene 1c, in which both sides are bulky, did not react (Table 2, entries 2–4). Additionally, 1e and 1f, differing in their carbon chain length,
led to the corresponding six- or seven-membered ring, respectively,
in moderate yields (Table 2, entries 5 and 6).

a Reaction conditions:
diene (1 mmol),
NbCl5 (0.1 mmol), TMSCl (0.5 mmol), Zn (1.5 mmol), PhCHCl2 (0.5 mmol), and THF (3 mL) at 60 °C for 2 h. Isolated
yields.

b No reaction.

c 40 °C for 6 h.

d Selectivity determined by 1H NMR or 19F NMR.

Aniline derivatives were also examined. N,N-Diallylaniline (1g) reacted efficiently to
give 2g in excellent yield. A small amount of the aromatized
product, pyrrole 2g′, was also obtained. The reactions
of the electron-rich anilines, N,N-diallyl-4-methylaniline (1h) and N,N-diallyl-4-methoxyaniline (1i), gave
the corresponding products in high yields. Conversely, N,N-diallyl-4-trifluoroaniline (1j)
was suitable, forming the corresponding product in excellent yield
with high selectivity (Table 2, entries 7–10).

Benzyloxycarbonyl-protected
diallylamine 1k was not
suitable for this system. It is considered that the oxygen site inhibited
the reaction (Table 2, entry 11). Furthermore, the malonate-based substrate 1l afforded a moderate amount of 2l (Table 2, entry 12).

The catalytic
system in the cross-metathesis reaction having two
different terminal olefins was also examined (Scheme 4). 1-Dodecene (3a) (1 mmol)
was reacted with vinylcyclohexane (3b) (10 mmol) to yield
(22%) 1-cyclohexyl-1-dodecene (5ab) along with trace
amounts of 11-docosene and dicyclohexylethene.

Scheme 4 Cross-Metathesis
Study
The olefination reaction of
ketone 4 was also examined
(Scheme 5). As a result,
(cyclohexylidenemethyl)benzene (5c) was obtained in 20%
yield. However, the product (5c) was not obtained in
the absence of NbCl5, suggesting the formation of Nb-benzylidene
species during the catalytic cycle.

Scheme 5 Olefination of Cyclohexanone
Using the Present System
Although it is not possible to elucidate the detailed
reaction
mechanism, a possible reaction path for this transformation is shown
in Scheme 6. First, a low-valent niobium species is generated
by reduction of niobium chloride with Zn. The formation of an organozinc
compound results from the reaction of PhCH2Cl2 with Zn and is activated by TMSCl. The low-valent Nb reacts with
the organozinc compound to yield the Nb-based active species, and
stilbene forms via dimerization of the organozinc compound.

Scheme 6 Plausible
Mechanism for the Formation of Nb-Based Active Species
The formation of Ru-carbene complexes by using
PhCHCl2 was reported,10 which
suggests the formation
of Nb-alkylidene analogues in our catalytic system. However, all of
the attempts to isolate and characterize the Nb-alkylidene species
were unsuccessful.

The subsequent carbene RCM reaction proceeds
according to the general
metathesis mechanism (Scheme 7).1j The Nb-based active species A reacts with an olefin via B to give C, which reacts with another olefin via niobacycle D to
yield the product, with regeneration of the active catalytic species A.

Scheme 7 Plausible Mechanism for the RCM Reaction
Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed an in situ-generated Nb complex catalyst
for the quantitative preparation of 3-pyrroline derivatives via the
RCM reaction of N,N-diallyl-p-toluenesulfonamides. A series of RCM reactions with Nb
as the catalyst was studied, and the desired products were obtained
quantitatively. This study is one of only a few studies in this area,
and the results will provide a platform for the development of other
Nb-catalyzed metathesis reactions.

Experimental Section
General
GC analysis was performed with a flame ionization
detector using a 0.22 mm × 25 m capillary column (BP-5). 1H and 13C NMR were measured at 400 and 100 MHz,
respectively, in CDCl3 with Me4Si as the internal
standard. Compounds 1a,111b,111c,121d,131e,111f,121g,141h,141i,141j,161k,122a,112b,112e,112f,122g,152g′,142h,182h′,142i,192i′,142j,202j′,17 and 2l(12) are known compounds, which have previously been reported. Other
compounds, including 1l, 3a, 3b, and NbCl5 (Wako, 95% purity), were purchased and used
without purification.

Purification of Zinc (Wako, Powder, 75–150
μm)
Zn (5 g) was added to 10% HCl aq (20 mL) and stirred
for 5 min.
Thereafter, the mixture was filtered and washed with H2O (10 mL) and acetone (10 mL). The solid was dried under vacuum for
1 day.

Procedure for the Preparation of 2a (Entry 1, Table 1)
A mixture
comprising THF (1.5 mL), Zn (98 mg, 1.5 mmol), and TMSCl (54 mg, 0.5
mmol) was stirred for 10 min at room temperature under an Ar atmosphere.
Thereafter, PhCHCl2 (81 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added to the
mixture and stirred for 10 min at 60 °C. At this time, a color
change of the reaction mixture to grayish brown was observed. NbCl5 (27 mg, 0.1 mmol) in THF (1.5 mL) was added to the solution
and stirred for 5 min, which resulted in the reaction mixture turning
color from dark violet to dark brown. Finally, the substrate N,N-diallyl-p-toluenesulfonamide
(1a, 251 mg, 1 mmol) was added to the solution and stirred
for 2 h at 60 °C. The RCM product (2a) was isolated
by column chromatography (silica gel (50 cc) neutralized by NEt3 (3 mL)/n-hexane/EtOAc = 100:0–4:1)
in 94% yield (211 mg) as a white solid (mp 124–125 °C).

1a:11 The product was prepared
as follows: a mixture comprising N,N-diallylamine (27.5 mmol), TsCl (25 mmol), CH2Cl2 (100 mL), and triethylamine (40 mmol) was stirred for 16 h at room
temperature. After the reaction, diethyl ether (100 mL) was added
to the mixture, and the organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated
under reduced pressure. Purification by silica gel chromatography
(n-hexane/EtOAc = 8:1) gave 1a (22.9
mmol, 92%) as a colorless oil; 1H NMR (400 MHz; CDCl3) δ 2.43 (s, 3H), 3.80 (d, J = 6.4

1b:11 The product was prepared
as follows: TsCl (12 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 mL)
was added to a solution of N-allylamine (12.5 mmol)
and triethylamine (12.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20
mL) at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for
16 h. After the reaction, diethyl ether (50 mL) was added to the mixture,
and the organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated under
reduced pressure to afford N-allyl-p-toluenesulfonamide (11 mmol, 91%) as a white solid. Thereafter,
a mixture composed of N-allyl-p-toluenesulfonamide
(3 mmol), 1-bromo-2-methyl-2-propene (5 mmol), and Cs2CO3 (9 mmol) in CH3CN (35 mL) was stirred at 80 °C
for 16 h. Thereafter, diethyl ether (50 mL) was added to the reaction
mixture, and the organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated
under reduced pressure. Purification by silica gel chromatography
(n-hexane/EtOAc = 8:1) yielded 1b (2.6
mmol, 87%) as a colorless oil; 1H NMR (400 MHz; CDCl3) δ: 1.69 (s, 3H), 2.42 (s, 3H), 3.70 (s, 2H), 3.77

as follows: a mixture comprising p-toluenesulfonamide
(3 mmol), 1-bromo-2-methyl-2-propene (9 mmol), and Cs2CO3 (9 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 mL) was stirred at 50 °C
for 24 h. Thereafter, diethyl ether (50 mL) was added to the mixture,
and the organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated under
reduced pressure. Purification by silica gel chromatography (n-hexane/EtOAc = 8:1) yielded 1c (2.9 mmol,

1e:11 The procedure
was
the same as for the preparation of 1b except that 1-bromo-3-butene
substituted 1-bromo-2-propene to afford 1e (2.8 mmol,

1g:14 The product was prepared
as follows: allylbromide (10 mmol) was added to a solution composed
of aniline (3 mmol) and Cs2CO3 (3.5 mmol) in
EtOH/H2O (12 mL, 4:1), and the mixture was stirred under
reflux conditions (ca. 80 °C) for 2 days. After the reaction,
diethyl ether (50 mL) was added to the mixture, and the organic layer
was washed with brine and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification
by silica gel chromatography (n-hexane/EtOAc = 4:1)
