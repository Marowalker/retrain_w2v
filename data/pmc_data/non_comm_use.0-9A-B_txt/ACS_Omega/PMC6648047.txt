Catalytic
hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over Ni2P-based catalysts
is a promising technology for the pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading. However,
substantial challenges still remain in the realization of the size
effect for phosphide catalysts in catalyzing this reaction, and the
precise size engineering of these catalysts is difficult. In this
work, the Ni2P/active carbon (AC) catalysts with varying
nickel phosphide nanoparticle sizes were one-pot prepared via the
modified organic liquid chemical reaction method. The Ni2P-based catalysts were tested for HDO of the pyrolysis oil model
compound (salicylaldehyde), and the conversion of salicylaldehyde
first increases and then decreases with the increase of Ni2P nanoparticle size, demonstrating that the activity for HDO of salicylaldehyde
can be controlled by using nickel phosphides of varying nanoparticle
sizes. The Ni2P-2/AC catalyst with approximately 5.49 nm
Ni2P nanoparticle size exhibited the highest activity with
conversion of salicylaldehyde reaching over 99% within 180 min under
220 °C, 2 MPa H2 pressure, and the corresponding yield
toward o-cresol was over 97%.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, the diminishing
availability of fossil-based energy resources
and the serious environmental pollutions force us to seek and develop
alternative fuels to meet the global needs, especially in the area
of the transportation sector. Biomass, which radically originated
from photosynthesis, is expected to be a renewable alternative to
fossil fuels because of its low price, wide distribution, and environment
friendliness. One of the most prospective routes of biomass utilization
is to convert it into liquid fuels (called pyrolysis oil) via fast
pyrolysis technology.1,2 However, the pyrolysis oil has
many disadvantages, such as the high oxygenation content, limited
thermal stability, high corrosion properties, and low heating value,
which hinders the direct utilization of pyrolysis oil as a vehicle
fuel in the current infrastructure. In order to convert pyrolysis
oil into a liquid vehicle fuel, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) as an effective
catalytic technology is carried out, which can remove oxygen in the
pyrolysis oil by reacting its oxygenated molecules with hydrogen using
a specific catalyst and obtain high-grade biofuels. Although considerable
efforts for the HDO of pyrolysis oil have resulted in impressive progress,
the industrial application of this method is impeded by some technical
barriers, such as catalyst deactivation, the low yield of the target
product, the loss of carbon, and the high hydrogen consumption.2,3 Therefore, it is important to develop effective HDO catalysts for
upgrading of pyrolysis oil.

In the research of an appropriate
catalyst for HDO purpose, various
catalysts, including metal sulfides, transition metals, noble metal,
metal phosphides, metal carbides, or related compounds, were investigated
in the catalytic HDO process.4−8 Traditionally, sulfide catalysts such as NiMoS or CoMoS supported
on alumina have been used for the HDO of pyrolysis oil. Although conventional
sulfide catalysts are very active for oxygen removal, the sulfur source
needs to be added to maintain the activity of the catalyst during
the reaction, which may cause the contamination of the product.9 An alternative approach based on noble metal
catalysts has shown some promise for the upgrading of pyrolysis oil.10 Wildschut et al.11 tested the HDO reaction of pyrolysis oil over Ru/C, Pd/C, and Pt/C
catalysts in comparison to metal sulfide-based catalysts, suggesting
that the deoxygenation performance of the noble-metal catalysts is
better than that of the traditional CoMoS/Al2O3 and NiMoS/Al2O3 catalysts. Unfortunately,
the high cost of noble metal catalysts severely hinders their practical
applications for bio-oil upgrading. In a more specific scenario, inexpensive
Ni2P-based catalysts are promising candidates for various
hydrogenation reactions because of their lower cost, good hydrogen
transfer properties, and low selectivity for C–C bond hydrogenolysis
and decarbonylation.12,13 Recently, nickel phosphide catalysts
exhibited superior catalytic activity in HDO reactions for pyrolysis
oil and model compounds such as 2-methoxyphenol,14,15 dibenzofuran,16 and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran.13 The performance of the Ni2P-based
catalysts is affected by the particle size of the active component
and the method of synthesis.17

Several
approaches have been developed in the literature for the
preparation of Ni2P-based catalysts, including H2 temperature programmed-reduction (TPR) of nickel phosphates, phosphorization
of metals or metal oxides with PH3/H2, and decomposition
of metal oxides and hypophosphite precursors.18 Compared with the other preparation methods, the TPR method has
been extensively used in the synthesis of Ni2P-based catalysts,
whereas a high temperature can break the strong P–O bond. However,
the high prepared temperature leads to the formation of lager size
of Ni2P nanoparticles for the catalysts.17 In fact, the size effect for the active component of the
catalysts plays a key role on the catalytic performance of catalysts.19 A study on the deoxygenation of methyl laurate
over nickel phosphide-based catalysts with variable sizes of Ni2P crystallite from 3 to 12 nm shows that the catalytic activity
increased with the Ni2P crystallite size and the lower
activity on smaller crystallites can be ascribed to the stronger interaction
between Ni and P, suggesting that the Ni2P crystallite
size plays a key role on the reaction pathway.20 Significant advances in the solution-phase synthesis of
metal phosphides using triphenylphosphine (TPP) and trioctylphosphine
(TOP) as the phosphorus sources provide an effective method for the
morphology control of the Ni2P active phase.15 Recently, the prepared Ni2P particles
were introduced onto the carrier to synthesize the supported nickel
phosphide in the literature. Cho et al.21 reported that the Ni2P nanoparticles were first prepared
by a liquid-phase phosphidation in the presence of TOP and TPP oxide
and then supported on γ-Al2O3 via an impregnation
process to obtain Ni2P/γ-Al2O3. Similarly, the SiO2-supported size-controlled Ni2P nanoparticles were prepared by Savithra et al.17 Although the controlled size of the Ni2P-based catalyst could be synthesized using the two-step method,
the supported Ni2P-based catalyst needs to be roasted at
a high temperature to improve the catalyst stability by strengthening
the metal–support interactions, which may cause the increase
of the crystallite size and the decrease of the particle dispersion
of the prepared catalysts.

Since the discovery of size-dependent
catalytic properties for
materials with size scales of less than 100 nm, the synthesis of nanosized
catalysts becomes very important and meaningful. In this work, a feasible
approach to one-pot synthesize the size-tunable Ni2P nanoparticles
supported on active carbon (Ni2P/AC) using the modified
organic liquid chemical reaction method. Salicylaldehyde (SA), as
a representative model compound of pyrolysis oil, was used to evaluate
the HDO performance of the metal phosphide catalysts. In addition,
5-methyl furfural (MF) was chosen as a compound produced from carbohydrates,
and the HDO of SA in the presence of carbohydrate-derived coreagents
(MF) was performed to investigate the stability of Ni2P/AC
catalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Controllable
Synthesis and Characterization
of Ni2P-Based Catalysts
The current synthetic
procedure is a modified version of the previously reported methods
for the one-pot synthesis of size-tunable Ni2P nanoparticle-supported
AC.

The transmission electron micrographs of the Ni2P-X/AC catalysts (Figure 1A–D) show that the nanoparticles were spherical and
uniformly distributed, which suggests that the relative size and dispersity
of the metal phosphide nanoparticle are synthesized during the chemical
reaction. The sizes of Ni2P nanoparticles Ni2P-1/AC, Ni2P-2/AC, Ni2P-3/AC, and Ni2P-4/AC are 4.47 ± 0.64, 5.49 ± 0.71, 7.04 ± 1.15,
and 9.99 ± 2.16 nm, respectively, which indicates that the amounts
of oleylamine (OA) and TOP play a key role on the formation of Ni2P nanoparticles. During the process of catalyst synthesis,
OA acts as the reductant and thus controls the nucleation rate; meanwhile,
TOP is used as the phosphorus source and stabilizing agent, which
provides a tunable surface stabilization through coordination on the
Ni(0) surface.22 In the synthesis, for
few amount of TOP, a fast reduction of the Ni(II) precursor took place,
leading to an important concentration of Ni(0) species which are not
efficiently stabilized by the ligands present in solution. Then, a
fast aggregation process results in the formation of large size Ni2P nanoparticles over Ni2P-X/AC catalysts. However,
when the amount of OA is reduced, a few nuclei are prepared, and the
presence of large amounts of TOP, an efficient ligand for Ni(0) species,
inhibits their growth, resulting in the formation of small nanoparticles.
Thus, the size of Ni2P NPs over Ni2P-4/AC is
larger than that of Ni2P-1/AC. In addition, the images
of selected-area electron diffraction and lattice fringes (shown in Figure 1B,C) suggest that
the spherical Ni2P nanoparticles are single crystalline.
Therefore, the size of the Ni2P NPs over the Ni2P-X/AC catalyst can be readily tuned by varying the concentration
of OA and TOP, which provides an effective method for precisely controlling
their size in a range of 4 to around 10 nm, at which these Ni2P nanoparticles supported on AC with various sizes would have
different properties possibly resulting in different reactivities.

particle size distribution. (E) SEM–EDS elemental mapping of
Ni2P-2/AC.

Figure 2 illustrates
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ni2P-X/AC catalysts
with different sizes of Ni2P nanoparticles. From the Figure 2, it can be easily
found that a broad diffraction peak at 20.8° is because of the
amorphous nature of AC for all of the catalysts. The sharp diffraction
signals at 2θ values of 40.7°, 44.6°, 47.4°,
and 54.2° can be attributed to the (111), (201), (210), and (300)
crystal faces of Ni2P, respectively, which confirms that
Ni2P particles were synthesized successfully.23 Compared with Ni2P-3/AC and Ni2P-4/AC, clear diffraction peaks from Ni2P nanoparticles
over Ni2P-1/AC and Ni2P-2/AC catalysts could
not be detected because of the small dimensions of the Ni2P nanoparticles, which suggests that Ni2P nanoparticles
for the Ni2P-1/AC and Ni2P-2/AC catalysts are
well dispersed on the surface of the carrier and it is advantageous
for metal sites forming high-efficiency synergistic effects with surface
acid sites.

Figure 2 XRD spectra of Ni2P-1/AC, Ni2P-2/AC, Ni2P-3/AC, and Ni2P-4/AC catalysts.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
was used to reveal
the chemical structure of Ni2P-based catalysts (shown in Figure 3). The strong peak
at approximately 3400 cm–1 was observed in the spectra
of Ni2P-X/AC catalysts, which attributed to the O–H
stretching vibration. Some peaks appeared at 1630 and 1374 cm–1 were C=O stretching vibration and −OH
flexural vibration in the −COOH group, respectively. The results
suggested that the surface of Ni2P-X/AC catalysts has carboxyl
and hydroxyl groups. In addition, the C–H stretching vibrations
at 2918 and 2850 cm–1 were observed, indicating
the presence of the aliphatic chain over Ni2P-X/AC catalysts.
The Raman spectra of the Ni2P-based catalysts were presented
in Figure 4, in which
the D band at ∼1350 cm–1 represents the disordered
structure of graphite, whereas the G band at ∼1580 cm–1 indicates the structure of the sp2-hybridized carbon
atom. The results illustrate that there are structural defects in
Ni2P-X/AC catalysts, which may promote the activity of
catalysts.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of Ni2P-1/AC, Ni2P-2/AC,
Ni2P-3/AC, and Ni2P-4/AC catalysts.

The nature of Ni2P-X/AC catalysts was
investigated by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM)–energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) elemental mapping (shown in Figure 1E). The results suggest that the surface
of the prepared catalysts consists of the elemental distribution of
P and Ni. TOP is used as the phosphorus source and stabilizing agent,
and the reaction of metal salts and TOP can generate the metal–phosphine
complexes, which continue to thermal decompose to produce the nickel
phosphide nanocrystals. As shown in the EDS mapping of a selected
area on the Ni2P-2/AC catalyst, a homogeneous distribution
of Ni and P in the same selected area was observed, indicating that
Ni2P nanoparticles are dispersed uniformly on the surface
of support, which is consistent with XRD results.

2.2 Catalytic HDO Tests
2.2.1 Effect of Temperature
on Catalytic Performance
of the Ni2P/AC Catalyst
To evaluate the usefulness
of the prepared Ni2P-based catalyst, the activity of Ni2P-X/AC for the HDO of the bio-oil model compound was performed.
In the present study, we used SA (2-hydroxy-benzaldehyde) as a representative
component of pyrolysis oil to explore the HDO pathways. In this work,
transformation of SA into o-cresol can proceed via path (i) hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis
or (ii) direct hydrogenolysis of the C=O bond.24Figure 5 presents the conversion and yield for SA HDO over Ni2P-2/AC, which were affected by the reaction temperature. The results
illustrate that as the reaction temperature increases, the conversion
of SA and the yield of o-cresol gradually increased. When the reaction
temperature is 260 °C, the yield of the target product of o-cresol
is maximized, reaching 97.1% for 2 h, which suggests that the reaction
temperature significantly enhanced catalytic activity in regioselective
HDO of SA.

Figure 5 Effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of
the Ni2P-2/AC catalyst for the HDO of SA under 2 MPa hydrogen
pressure for 2 h.

2.2.2 Effect
of Ni2P NP Size on the
Catalytic Performance of Ni2P-Based Catalysts
In order to study the effect of Ni2P NP size on the catalytic
performance of Ni2P-based catalysts, the HDO of SA was
conducted at 220 °C and 2 MPa H2 pressure. The
obvious differences in the catalytic activity can be observed for
the Ni2P-X/AC catalysts of varying sizes (shown in Figure 6). As the Ni2P nanoparticles decrease, the conversion first increases and
then decreases. Among them, the Ni2P-2/AC catalyst exhibits
more reactivity in HDO reaction with conversion of SA reaching over
99% within 180 min, and the yield toward o-cresol
was over 97%. Smaller Ni2P crystallites present stronger
Ni–P interactions and extra exposure of phosphorus on the surface,
which significantly affects the adsorption state of intermediates,
where the interaction between the Ni2P NPs and the reactants
is neither too weak (size > 5.49 nm) nor too strong (size <
5.49
nm).25,26 Thus, the activity for HDO of SA can be
controlled by using nickel phosphides of varying nanoparticle sizes.

Figure 6 Effect
of Ni2P NP size on the catalytic performance
of the Ni2P-based catalyst for the HDO of SA.

2.2.3 Effect of the Carbohydrate-Derived
Compound
on the Catalytic Performance of Ni2P-Based Catalysts
Although the carbohydrate-derived compounds have an impact on the
aromatic compounds during the HDO process, a few previous literature
studies for the pyrolysis oil upgrading focus on the interactions
between the carbohydrate-derived compounds and lignin-derived aromatics
in the HDO reaction. In this work, the effects of carbohydrate derivatives
(MF) on the HDO of pyrolysis oil derived from the phenolic fraction
(SA) over Ni2P-2/AC were investigated (shown in Figure 7a,b). The presence
of MF imposed a great influence on the conversion of SA and the yields
of o-cresol. The conversion of SA in the absence
of MF was 99% for 180 min, and the corresponding yield of o-cresol was 97% (shown in Figure 6. As there is an increase in the proportion
of MF in the reactants, both SA conversion and the o-cresol yield were significantly decreased. When the (MF)/(SA) value
was 1.00 (mol/mol), both the conversion of SA and the yield of the
o-cresol decreased sharply from 99 and 97% to 70 and 60%, respectively,
which illustrated that the reactivity of SA was suppressed by the
presence of MF in the reactants.

Figure 7 Effects of MF on the HDO of SA: (a) and
(b) over Ni2P-2/AC and (c) and (d) over Ni2P-X/AC
with different particle
sizes.

The catalytic HDO results of SA
in the presence of MF were then
examined using different sizes of Ni2P nanoparticles over
Ni2P-X/AC catalysts (Figure 7c,d), showing that the inhibiting effects of MF on
the HDO of SA. When MF was added at (MF)/(SA) = 1:2 (mol/mol), the
conversion of SA over Ni2P-1/AC, Ni2P-2/AC,
Ni2P-3/AC, and Ni2P-4/AC were 68, 71, 64, and
34%, respectively. The decreasing conversion of SA over Ni2P-X/AC catalysts in the presence of MF [(MF)/(SA) = 1:2 (mol/mol)]
indicates that the reactivity of SA was inhibited, which may be due
to the fact that the reaction of MF on Ni2P-based catalysts
was more active at the same active sites of the catalyst where the
HDO of SA takes place. Comparison on the results of in the presence
or absence of MF, significantly reduced catalytic activity over the
Ni2P-4/AC catalyst was observed, 53% for conversion and
59% for the yield toward o-cresol, which may be ascribed
to the poisoning of catalysts by the carbon deposition caused by the
polymerization of adsorbed MF.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we report the fabrication of Ni2P/AC
catalysts with different Ni2P nanoparticle sizes via the
one-pot procedure based on the organic liquid chemical reaction approach.
A strong size effect of Ni2P NPs on their catalytic activity
and stability in the HDO of SA was observed. Compared with other nickel
phosphide catalysts, the Ni2P-2/AC catalyst with approximately
5.49 nm favored the o-cresol product where the yield
reached up to 97.0% under 220 °C, 2 MPa H2 pressure
for 3 h. Furthermore, the influence of carbohydrate derivatives (MF)
on the HDO of the lignin-derived compound (SA) was observed in this
work, elucidating that the presence of MF inhibits the HDO of SA.
The differences in the reactivity and stability during the HDO process
may be attributed to the variation of Ni2P nanoparticle
size. Developing size-tunable catalysts and understanding the size
effect during the hydrodeoxgenation process will be significant for
the pyrolysis bio-oil upgrade.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 One-Pot Synthesis of Ni2P Nanoparticle
Catalysts
Ni2P/AC catalysts with various Ni2P nanoparticle sizes were synthesized by the modified organic
liquid chemical reaction method.27 Nickel
acetylacetonate [Ni(acac)2; 99%, Shanghai Dibo Chemicals
Technology Co., Ltd.], AC (Xfnano), oleylamine (OAm; 90%, Energy-Chemical),
TOP (90%, Energy-Chemical), and tetradecane (C14H30; 97%, Heowns) were added in a 100 mL flask and heated in a nitrogen
atmosphere at 120 °C for 20 min under stirring, giving a homogeneous
solution. Then, the mixture was continued to heat to 220 °C in
20 min and the temperature was maintained constant for 3 h, then subsequently
cooled. The obtained catalysts were washed with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture
of isopropanol and ethanol (99.9%, Kermel), isolated via centrifugation,
and dried at 50 °C for 24 h. The specific amounts of the chemicals
used to prepare the different Ni2P nanoparticles are gathered
in Table 1. According
to the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy test,
the Ni contents of the Ni2P-1/AC, Ni2P-2/AC,
Ni2P-3/AC, and Ni2P-4/AC catalysts were 4.7,
4.9, 4.9, and 4.9 wt %, respectively.

4.2 Characterizations
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out using JEM-2100F. XRD was
performed by a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54184 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA in the range
of 5–90°. The FT-IR spectrum was determined by Bio-Rad
FTS6000. Raman spectroscopy was recollected using an argon ion laser
at 514.5 nm wavelength (Renishaw inVia reflex Raman microscope, Renishaw
plc, U.K.) to analyze the graphitic structure of samples.

4.3 Catalytic Ability Test of Ni2P-Based
Catalysts
The catalyst was applied in the model reaction
of biofuel upgrade: the HDO of SA in the presence or absence of MF.
In a typical reaction procedure, SA (8.19 mmol), MF (0–8.19
mmol), tetrahydrofuran (40 mL), and a solid catalyst (0.10 g) were
added to the stainless steel autoclave reactor (∼100 mL). In
this work, MF was used to investigate the influence of carbohydrate
derivatives on the HDO of SA. The molar ratio of MF to SA was adjusted
from 0 to 1.0 (mol/mol). After checking the leakage and displacing
air, hydrogen of 2 MPa pressure was pumped into the reactor, then
carried out at 140–260 °C under stirring at 800 rpm. After
the reaction, the solid catalyst was separated and the liquid product
was obtained at room temperature. The liquid products were analyzed
by a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC/MS, Thermo Science
Trace 1300, US) with a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm
× 0.5 μm) and further quantified using a GC with an FFAP
capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm) equipped
with a flame ionized detector (GC/FID, Pgeneral GC-1100, China) using
dodecane as an internal standard.
