In this work, a carbon nanotube (CNT)-based
membrane [(4-((4-((11-ferroceneundecyl)oxy)phenyl)diazenyl)phenoxy)-diethylene
triamine (FADETA)/polyethyleneimine (PEI)-decorated CNT membrane]
with stimuli-switchable separation fluxes was developed. The multiwalled
CNTs were modified by a pH-, light-, and redox stimuli-responsive
surfactant FADETA initially, and then the FADETA-decorated CNTs were
further cross-linked by PEI and finally coated on the polypropylene
membrane. Interestingly, the particular membrane was successfully
applied in emulsion systems to separate oil and water with high efficiency.
First, the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane showed highly porous
microstructural characteristics owing to the overlapped and cross-linked
CNTs as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy observation.
Then, it showed strong hydrophilicity to water in the air and high
oleophobicity to oil underwater, thereby endowing the membrane with
the potential to separate oil and water. Owing to the modified multiple
stimuli-responsive FADETA on CNTs, the separation fluxes were stimuli-switchable,
which could be adjusted reversibly by environmental factors including
pH, light, and redox.

Introduction
Nowadays, the environmental
pollution of air, water, and soil caused
by daily life, agriculture, and industry has become one of the most
serious threats to human beings globally. The purification of rising
sewage is a big challenge, and the classic physical adsorption method
is dominantly applied currently.1−4 Development of new renewable techniques with low
cost, high efficiency, and convenient operation is attractive, and
the flourishing functional nanomaterials show tremendous potential
and contribute lots in this field as summarized by Li and co-workers.5 Beyond the direct degradation of chemicals by
the biological and photocatalytic techniques,6−9 membrane separation is an alternative
and promising method to desalinate and reuse wastewater especially
in the large-scale treatment.10−12 Emulsified water is a typical
sewage that can be renewed rapidly and efficiently by the oil–water
separation membrane technique,13 and numerous
porous nanomaterials including both inorganic and organic chemicals
were employed as the objective substrates successfully.14−20 Generally speaking, membranes with the particular surface nature
such as the superhydrophilic–superoleophobic or superoleophilic–superhydrophobic
characteristics are essential in the efficient oil–water separation
treatments.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), one isotope of amazing
carbon, have prominent
properties such as good chemical stability, high mechanical strength,
excellent electric and thermal conductivity, and so forth,21−24 thereby attracting much attention since the day of discovery. Nowadays,
CNTs and their nanocomposites show a remarkable potential in wide
fields including oil–water separation.25−28 Shi et al.29 developed a type of ultrathin single-walled CNT (SWCNT)
network films, which were applied to separate oil and water efficiently
from the emulsified oil and water mixtures because of their selective
superwetting effect to oil drops. Similarly, Jin et al.30 constructed a super-oil-repellent membrane based
on the tannic acid-decorated multiple-walled CNT (MWCNT) with high
affinity to water, endowing it with a promising oil–water separation
capability. Alternatively, Hu and co-workers developed a nanoporous
membrane based on the polymer cohybrid SWCNTs,31 which was highly efficient in the oil–water separation
field. More importantly, the membrane showed interesting light-response
that the separation fluxes could be reversibly controlled by light
irradiation. Beyond the tremendous potential in the oil–water
separation of nanocomposites of CNTs, attractive separation controllability
was also realized through simple modification on them, which was critically
important in extending the application of CNT membranes. It is well-known
that surfactants can change the surface wettability of materials significantly.32,33 Therefore, the surface nature of the CNT membrane would certainly
be improved through the modification of the surfactants on CNTs. Furthermore,
novel surfactants containing some particular stimuli-responsive moieties
might endow the membrane with additional controllability and synergy
in oil–water separation.

According to the primary principle
mentioned above, a multiple
stimuli-responsive surfactant-decorated CNT membrane was developed
according to Scheme 1. Initially, the pH-, light- and redox-responsive surfactant, (4-((4-((11-ferroceneundecyl)oxy)phenyl)diazenyl)phenoxy)-diethylene
triamine (FADETA), was covalently combined with CNTs. Then, polyethyleneimine
(PEI) was employed as the cross-linking reagent to favor the formation
of a stable and hierarchical CNT network. Finally, the commercial
polypropylene (PPE) membrane was used as the substrate to support
the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane by vacuum filtration. The microstructural
and physicochemical properties of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane
were studied in detail. By employing the sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-stabilized
oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions as the model objects, the oil–water
separation efficiency of the developed CNT membrane was studied quantitatively.
Moreover, the effect of stimuli-responsive factors including pH, light,
and redox on the separation efficiency was also studied. The present
work not only reported a new oil–water separation membrane
but also provided a new way to control the separation process through
introducing multiple stimuli-responsive surfactants, which was of
great importance from both fundamental and application aspects.

Scheme 1 Representative Synthetic Process of FADETA-/PEI-Decorated CNTs
Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the FADETA-/PEI-Decorated CNT
In
order to clarify the successful modification of FADETA and PEI on
CNTs, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) measurements were employed. TGA results (Figure 1a) showed the weight loss of pure CNTs, FADETA-decorated
CNTs, and FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNTs. For pure CNTs, the slight decrease
of mass below 100 °C was attributed to the removal of adsorbed
water, whereas the apparent mass loss about 9.1% above 115 °C
was caused by the loss of functional groups including carboxyl and
hydroxyl groups.34 The TGA curve of FADETA-decorated
CNTs showed two typical mass loss stages: the first one between about
120 and 250 °C was caused by the residual carboxyl and hydroxyl
groups in the pure CNTs and the second one between about 300 and 500
°C was caused by the modified FADETA on CNTs. The total weight
loss of FADETA-decorated CNTs was 19.6% that was far larger than that
of pure CNTs, indicating the successful modification of FADETA on
CNTs. Alternatively, the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNTs only showed one
mass loss stage from about 200 to 500 °C with a weight loss of
30.7%, suggesting that PEI was also covalently cross-linked with CNTs
successfully. TGA results showed that the mass ratios of the modified
FADETA and PEI in FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNTs were 14.4 and 18.7% (Supporting Information, eq S1–S3), respectively.

Figure 1 TGA curves
(a) and FTIR spectra (b) of pure CNTs, FADETA-decorated
CNTs, and FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNTs.

Figure 1b
shows
the corresponding FTIR spectra of pure CNTs, FADETA-decorated CNTs,
and FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNTs, and obvious difference could be observed.
For pure CNTs, typical stretching vibration peaks of O–H, C=O,
and C–O were observed clearly.35 In addition, the stretching vibration peak of residual C–H
in CNTs was also presented at around 2750–3000 cm–1. However, a new peak at 840 cm–1 in the FADETA-decorated
CNTs was observed, which represented the out-of-plane bending mode
of C–H in the aromatic moieties, suggesting the presence of
FADETA on CNTs well.36 Once FADETA-decorated
CNTs were further modified by PEI, the stretching vibration band at
1403 cm–1 nearly disappeared, whereas a distinguishing
C–N stretching vibration peak at 1467 cm–1 was observed instead. Moreover, there existed a strong peak at about
3500 cm–1, corresponding to the abundant stretching
vibration of N–H bond in the FADETA and PEI molecules. Thus,
the FTIR spectra results also supported the successful modification
of FADETA and PEI on CNTs.

Figure 2a shows
the photograph of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane, which showed
a macrouniform and black surface clearly. In order to make a better
understanding on the microstructural characteristics of the CNT membrane,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation was employed. Figure 2b shows the corresponding
surface characteristic of the CNT membrane that contained large porous
nanochannels with the size of about tens of nanometers, which were
generally formed by the highly overlapped and cross-linked CNTs, endowing
the membrane with the potential to separate fluids. The cross-sectional
image of the CNT membrane (Supporting Information, Figure S3) suggested that the porous PPE membrane was completely
covered by a large amount of agglomerated CNTs. Figure 2c shows the corresponding magnified cross-sectional
appearance of the CNT membrane, and two typical characteristics were
observed. The surface of the supported PPE membrane was relatively
smooth, whereas that of the CNT membrane was highly rough and porous
with a thickness of about several micrometers. Certainly, the SEM
results evidently confirmed the successful development of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane.

and the
corresponding SEM images of the surface (b) and cross section (c),
photographs of water (d) and CH2Cl2 (e) drops
on the CNT membrane in the air and underwater, respectively, and effect
of pushing (f) and lifting (g) on the appearance of an oil drop on
the CNT membrane underwater.

Because the selective affinity to either water or oil is
an essential
requirement for the oil–water separation membrane, the surface
nature of the CNT membrane was also studied by the contact angle measurements
as shown in Figure 2d–g. It was noticed that the contact angle of a drop of water
on the CNT membrane was only 17° in the air (Figure 2d) and the drop would completely
spread later, whereas that of a drop of CH2Cl2 was high up to 150° underwater (Figure 2e). Moreover, the shape of CH2Cl2 drops changed a little through pushing or lifting
(Figure 2f,g), suggesting
a high superoleophobicity. Undoubtedly, the results evidently confirmed
the superhydrophilic–superoleophobic nature of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane, endowing it with the attracting potential in the oil–water
separation.

Application of the FADETA-/PEI-Decorated
CNT Membrane in Oil–Water
Separation
According to the particular surface nature of
the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane, SDS-stabilized O/W type emulsions
(Supporting Information S4) were employed
as the typical templates to evaluate its oil–water separation
efficiency by the equipment represented by Figure 3a. Figure 3b,c shows the typical macroappearance of dodecane/water
emulsions and the filtrate through flowing past the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane. Clearly, the original emulsion containing Sudan red
in the oil phase was opalescent and pink, whereas the filtrate became
transparent and colorless through the CNT membrane, suggesting that
the dodecane phase was completely separated from the emulsion. The
corresponding laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) images also
supported the result that emulsion droplets containing some oil-soluble
fluorochrome Nile red disappeared completely in the filtrate (Figure 3b,c). In order to
clarify the importance of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane in
the oil–water separation rather than the contained PPE layer,
the oil–water separation efficiency of the pure PPE membrane
was also studied. It was noticed that the PPE membrane showed little
selective affinity to both water and oil, and nearly no apparent difference
could be observed in comparison with the original emulsion and the
filtrate (Supporting Information, S5).
Undoubtedly, these results evidenced that the excellent oil–water
separation efficiency was attributed to the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane certainly. It was also noticed that the flux was kept
nearly constant after 10 times of continuous separation processes
for hexane/water emulsions (Supporting Information S6), suggesting the excellent antifouling performance of the
FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane.

Figure 3 (a) Representative illustration of an
oil–water separation
device, (b) LSCM image of SDS-stabilized hexane/water emulsions (b)
and filtrate (c). The inset images in (b,c) represent the corresponding
appearance of emulsion and filtrate and the LSCM image of the filtrate
obtained under bright field. Bars: 10 μm.

Figure 4a
shows
the quantitative separation fluxes of the CNT membrane from three
different O/W emulsions through changing the oil phase from hexane,
dodecane, to toluene. No significant difference was observed from
the averaged fluxes for hexane/water and dodecane/water emulsions,
which were 816 and 790 L·m–2·h–1·MPa–1, respectively. However, the flux for
toluene/water emulsion was limited to 695 L·m–2·h–1·MPa–1, which was
much lower than those emulsions using alkanes as the oil phase. A
possible reason might come from the stronger affinity between toluene
and the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane because there existed additional
interactions such as cationic-π and π–π interactions
between toluene and FADETA molecules. Certainly, the present results
confirmed the general efficiency of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT
membrane in the oil–water separation.

the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane for
different emulsions.

In addition, FADETA is a multiple-stimuli-responsive surfactant,
which responses to light, redox, and pH through the following mechanism
(Figure 5a). Generally
speaking, UV-light irradiation induces the trans–cis isomerization
of an azobenzene moiety, acidification by HCl favors the protonation
of amino groups, and addition of FeCl3 oxidizes the ferrocene
moiety into its oxidation state, respectively. Such transitions were
observed from the corresponding UV–vis spectra of the FADETA
aqueous solution (Figure 5b), and similar responsive properties and transition mechanisms
of particular functional moieties by stimuli-responsive factors were
reported widely.37−43 It should be mentioned that the hydrophilicity of FADETA was strengthened
either by UV-light irradiation, acidification, or oxidation though
the alteration amplitude was slightly different.

Figure 5 pH-, light-, and redox-induced
structural transitions of FADETA
(a) and effect of acidification and (b) UV light and oxidation on
the UV–vis spectra of 0.025 mM FADETA aqueous solution.

Contact angle measurements showed
that a little change could be
observed from the particular surface wettability of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane when it was disposed by UV-light irradiation, oxidation
by FeCl3, and acidification by HCl. The contact angle results
of water in the air and CH2Cl2 underwater (Figure 6a–f) were
similar to those of the original sample (Figure 2d,e), respectively. In other words, its primary
surface characteristics of the high hydrophilicity to water in the
air and superoleophobicity to oil underwater of the CNT membrane were
retained. In order to make a better understanding, the effects of
stimuli-responsive factors on the oil–water separation efficiency
of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane were also studied by employing
the SDS-stabilized hexane/water emulsions as the model. Generally
speaking, all membranes showed excellent oil–water separation
efficiency, and the milky-like emulsions were transformed into transparent
phase through fluxing the corresponding membranes. However, the measured
separation fluxes were changed significantly when the membranes were
dealt by UV-light irradiation, oxidation by FeCl3, and
acidification by HCl, which were 832, 679, and 641 L·m–2·h–1·MPa–1, respectively.
The current results supported the controllability of stimuli-responsive
factors certainly. Moreover, the fluxes of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane for hexane/water emulsions returned to its original state
after the UV–vis light irradiation, oxidation–reduction,
and acid–base treatment cycles (Supporting Information S7), suggesting that the separation flux could
be controlled reversibly.

underwater, respectively. Images (a–f) represent the corresponding
appearance after UV-light irradiation (a,b), oxidation (c,d), and
acidification (e,f). (g) Stimuli-switchable separation fluxes of the
CNT membrane.

In comparison with the
original FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane,
oxidation by FeCl3 and acidification by HCl affected the
separation fluxes significantly that the fluxes were decreased about
20%, whereas UV-light irradiation affected a little. The tendency
might be related to the distinguishing transition mechanisms of different
stimuli-responsive factors though all factors resulted in the increase
of the hydrophilicity as mentioned above. Trans–cis isomerization
of the azobenzene moiety induced by UV-light irradiation changed the
dipole moment a little from about 0 to 3 debye.44,45 As a result, the hydrophilicity of FADETA was increased slightly,46,47 which limitedly affected the microstructure and surface nature of
the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane. In contrast, the protonation
of amino groups of both FADETA and PEI molecules by acidification
strongly increased the hydrophilicity and oleophobicity of the CNT
membrane in the air and underwater, respectively, which benefited
to enhance the oil–water separation efficiency. However, the
electrostatic interactions between decorated molecules were highly
strengthened, which were dominantly disadvantaged to the separation
efficiency.35,48,49 Similarly, the oxidized FADETA is a bola-type surfactant after oxidation
that also strengthens the electrostatic interactions of the CNT membrane,
resulting in the decrease of separation flux. Simultaneously, the
oxidized FADETA molecules prefer to adopt the extended configuration
because of the electrostatic interactions between two headgroups within
the oxidized FADETA. Correspondingly, the steric hindrance of the
pore in the CNT membrane should be enhanced, which is also disadvantaged
to the separation.

Conclusions
In summary, a new type
of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane
was developed, which was composed of overlapped and cross-linked CNTs
with highly porous microstructural characteristics. Furthermore, the
membrane showed apparent hydrophilicity to water in the air whereas
superoleophobicity to oil underwater, thereby endowing it with interesting
potential in the oil–water separation field. It was noticed
that no significant difference was observed from the separation efficiency
regardless of the oil type, whereas the oil type of emulsions affected
the separation flux strongly. For example, the separation fluxes of
the SDS-stabilized hexane/water and dodecane/water emulsions were
816 and 790 L·m–2·h–1·MPa–1, respectively, and that of toluene/water
emulsion was limited to 695 L·m–2·h–1·MPa–1. Although the particular
surface wettability of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane was
mainly attributed to the hydrophilic amino groups of the cross-linking
reagent PEI, similar works were reported previously.35 However, the introduced multiple responsive surfactant
FADETA in this work endowed the surface nature of the CNT membrane
with additional controllability through stimulating environmental
factors such as pH, light, and redox, thereby controlling the separation
flux reversibly. The oil–water separation results showed that
the fluxes were changed to 832, 679, and 641 L·m–2·h–1·MPa–1 for hexane/water
emulsions once the membrane was irradiated by UV-light, redoxed by
FeCl3, and acidified by HCl, respectively. Undoubtedly,
the current results evidently confirmed the application of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane in the controlled oil–water separation well. Owing
to its particular surface wettability of the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane, it might also shed some potential in antifouling, the
generation of electronic devices and textiles, and so forth.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Chemicals including carboxylic MWCNTs (outer
diameter: 8–15 nm, length: 50 μm, 95%), 4-hydroxyaminobenzene
(98%), phenol (99%), diethylenetriamine (99%), SDS (99%), and 1,2-dibromoethane
(99%) were obtained from J&K Chemicals. 11-Bromoundecanoic acid
(95%) and PEI with a molecular weight of 10 000 were purchased
from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. PPE membrane (mean pore size
0.22 mm) was obtained from Xiya Reagent. Ferrocene (98%) and all other
analytical grade reagents including methanol, dichloromethane, hydrochloric
acid, sodium hydroxide, and FeCl3 were obtained from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without
further purification. The surfactant FADETA was synthesized according
to the procedure as mentioned in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information. Water was Millipore Milli-Q-grade.

Preparation of the FADETA-/PEI-Decorated CNT Membrane
The
FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNT membrane was prepared according to Scheme 1, and the typical
synthetic detail was described as follows:

The mixture of carboxylic
CNTs (100 mg) and thionyl chloride (50 mL) was added into a round-bottom
flask and refluxed for 3 h at 70 °C under stirring. Excess thionyl
chloride was removed under reduced pressure to give the acyl chloride
CNTs, which were further washed with dichloromethane until all thionyl
chloride was removed. The acyl chloride CNTs were dispersed in 200
mL dichloromethane and cooled to 0 °C. Then, 40 mL dichloromethane
solution containing FADETA (50 mg, 0.07 mmol) and a catalytic amount
of trimethylamine was added slowly. The mixture was warmed to room
temperature and stirred for additional 5 h and then filtered through
a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane and washed with dichloromethane
to give the FADETA-decorated CNTs, which were further dried in a vacuum
oven for 24 h at 50 °C. Next, 50 mg FADETA-decorated CNTs were
added into PEI aqueous solution (2 g in 50 mL water), which was sonicated
for additional 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for
10 min to give the FADETA-/PEI-decorated CNTs. Finally, the commercial
PPE membrane was used as the substrate to support the FADETA-/PEI-decorated
CNT membrane by vacuum filtration.

Preparation of O/W Emulsions
The surfactant-stabilized
O/W emulsions including hexane/water, toluene/water, and dodecane/water
emulsions were prepared by the same procedure. Briefly, 2 mL oil and
0.2 g sodium dodecyl sulfate were added into 100 mL deionized water,
and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.

Characterization
FTIR were recorded on a Nicolet iS10
spectrophotometer (Thermo, USA). The samples were prepared as KBr
pellets, and the spectra were calculated from a total of 16 scans.
SEM images were taken on a field-emission microscope (Zeiss Sigma)
operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Recorded SEM images allowed
studying the morphology of the underwater superoleophobic coating.
TGA was conducted on TG 209 F1 (NETZSCH, Germany) with a temperature
increase of 10 °C·min–1 at the nitrogen
atmosphere. LSCM observation of dodecane/water emulsion and the filtrate
was performed on a dual-disk fast live-cell confocal imaging system
(PerkinElmer UltraVIEW VoX). During the process, a small amount of
Nile red was solubilized in the oil phase, and the excitation wavelength
of 561 nm was used. Contact angle measurements were conducted by using
a DSA-100 instrument (Kruss).

O/W Separation
O/W emulsion separation experiments
were performed using a homemade filtration device. The flux (JF) was determined by calculating the volume
of the filtrate within 1 min using the following equation  where V is the volume of
emulsion, A is the valid area of the membrane (12.56
cm2), and Δt and Δp represent the testing time and the membrane pressure,
respectively.
