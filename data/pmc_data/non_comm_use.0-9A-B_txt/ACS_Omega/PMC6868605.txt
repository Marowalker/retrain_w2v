Nanofiller zirconium phosphate (ZrP)
and ethylene-methyl acrylate–glycidyl
methacrylate copolymer (EMA–GMA) were introduced into poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) through reactive melt-blending method to improve its toughness.
The impact strength of PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP (82/15/3) nanocomposites
was improved about 22 times that of pure PLA to 65.5 kJ/m2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated
there were compatibilization reactions between the components. The
miscibility and thermal behavior of the blends were investigated by
dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetric
(DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied to observe
the fractured surface and phase morphology to study the toughness
mechanism. A typical core–shell morphology, ZrP wrapped by
EMA–GMA phase, was observed in the nanocomposites, which can
cause plastic deformations. The supertough effect of the compound
was mainly confirmed by effective interfacial compatibilization and
massive shear-yielding deformation achieved by the synergy of EMA–GMA
with ZrP in the PLA matrix.

1 Introduction
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
is a biodegradable polymer that can be
completely obtained from renewable resources. It has been widely used
recently due to its good biodegradability, biocompatibility, transparency,
high mechanical strength, and excellent processability.1−4 Because the problem of pollution is becoming more and more serious,
PLA has become a potential replacement for petroleum-based plastics
in many applications, such as packaging, fiber and biomedical materials.4−7 However, its deficiencies such as brittleness and bad ductility
have limited its commercial application greatly. Therefore, a large
number of strategies such as physical blending,8−15 copolymerization,16−18 and plasticization19 have
been used to toughen PLA to improve its physical performance. Particularly,
among all the effective methods, reactive melt-blending with elastomer–ethylene–methyl
acrylate–glycidyl methacrylate (EMA–GMA) can obtain
excellent toughness. Recently, many studies13,20,21 have reported supertough PLA-based compounds.
EMA–GMA can react with PLA, and the interfacial adhesion can
be promoted. The formation of special phase morphologies also plays
a key role in improving the impact strength of PLA blends drastically.

Polymer/montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites have better physical
and mechanical properties than either pure polymers or microcomposites.22 Similar to MMT clay, synthetic α-zirconium
phosphate (ZrP) (Zr(HPO4)2·H2O) has the same layered structure. However, the difference with MMT
clay is that the layers of ZrP are formed by zirconium atoms and the
oxygen atoms of phosphate groups are connected with them. The layers
are also formed by three oxygen atoms, which are contributed by each
phosphate molecule and the phosphate molecule also donating one hydroxyl
group pointing into the interlayer space.23 Due to the remarkable structure, ZrP has many excellent features,
such as good chemical and thermal stability, high mechanical strength,
perfect particle size, ease of surface functionality control, and
high purity, aspect ratio, and ion-exchange capacity.24−27 A strong interaction of interfacial between ZrP and polymer composites
can be achieved by miscibility reaction, and the nanofiller ZrP can
evenly disperse in a polymer matrix. Through ionic bond, hydrogen
bond, van der Waals forces, and other actions, polymer molecules can
be inserted into the spaces between layers of nanolayered zirconium
phosphate, thus the compound of polymer matrix with a nanofiller ZrP
can be achieved on a nanoscale. Then, the thermal stability, electrical
conductivity, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites material
are improved.28−30 So, the addition of nanofiller ZrP can promote the
physical properties and broaden the application field of polymers.

In this study, we filled nanofiller ZrP and elastomer EMA–GMA
into the PLA matrix through reactive melt-blending to fabricate supertough
nanocomposites. The attention was focused on the improvement of toughness
and thermal stability of the composition, and the synergistic toughening
mechanism of EMA–GMA and ZrP on PLA was also studied. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no study on this so far. The toughening
mechanism was analyzed by various characterization studies, such as
Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).
The relationship between the mechanical properties, thermal behavior,
and phase morphology of the nanocomposites was also established.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The
poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
(commercially labeled as 4032D, had a high optical purity with about
98% l-lactide content) was supplied by Nature Works Co. Ltd.
Its density, molecular weight (Mw), and
polydispersity index are 1.24 g/cm3, 1.7 × 105 g/mol, and 1.74 respectively. The ethylene–methyl
acrylate–glycidyl methacrylate (EMA–GMA) is a random
terpolymer of 68% ethylene, 24% acrylic ester, and 8% glycidyl methacrylate
purchased from Arkema Company with a commercial name of Lotader AX
8900. ZrP was purchased from Mianzhu Yaolong Chemical Co. Ltd. (China).
The content of ZrO2 is greater than or equal to 40%, and
its density is 1.6 g/cm3. Figure 1 shows the SEM micrograph of ZrP and its
average lamellar thickness and particle size are about 83.5 nm and
1.7 μm, respectively. Chemical structure of PLA, EMA–GMA,
and ZrP used for the blends are shown in Figure 2.

structures of PLA, EMA–GMA, and ZrP.

2.2 Sample Preparation
PLA pellets and
ZrP powder were dried at 80 °C in an oven to remove the moisture
for 12 h. Afterward, the mixed PLA/EMA–GMA (15 wt %) samples
with different contents (1, 3, and 5 wt %) of ZrP were melt-blended
by an internal mixer (Brabender W50E) at 200 °C for 6 min with
a rotor speed of 60 rpm. Subsequently, the samples were compressed
by a compression molding machine (QBL-350, Wuxi No. 1 Rubber and Plastic
Machinery Co., Ltd., China). The process parameters of temperature
and pressure for compression molding were 200 °C and 100 bar,
respectively. The tensile and impact samples were prepared by cutting
standard sizes.

2.4 Characterization
2.4.1 Mechanical Properties
Tensile specimens
of a dumbbell shape with a gauge length of 35 mm, width of 4 mm, and
thickness of 1 mm were machined and tested by an Instron 5566-type
universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min according
to the ASTM D882 standard. All values were repeated five times, and
the average values were obtained.

A Zwick impact tester (model
5117, Germany) was used to conduct impact testing according to the
GB/T 1843 (2008) standard. All data were the average of 5 determinations.
All tests were performed at room temperature.

2.4.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR)
FTIR absorption spectra of PLA, EMA–GMA, ZrP,
and PLA/EMA–GMA binary blends with 15 wt % EMA–GMA and
PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites (with 3 wt % ZrP) were recorded
using Perkin–Elmer Spectrum 2000 instrument in the wave number
range of 400–4000 cm–1. All specimens but
ZrP were compressed into slices of 120 μm thickness at 200 °C
before test. A small amount of dried ZrP powder was ground with dried
KBr powder and then compressed into disks for the FTIR test at room
temperature.

2.4.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The fractured surface morphology of PLA/EMA–GMA
binary blend
and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites with 3 wt % content of nanofiller
ZrP was studied by using scanning electron microscopy (FEI-SEM). The
SEM was operated at the condition of 5 kV accelerating voltage to
characterize the phase morphology of the impact-fractured and cryofracture
surfaces. The fractured surface was gold coated for 0.1 nm in thickness
before SEM imaging to avoid electrostatic charging during inspection.

2.4.4 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The morphologies of the dispersed phases were observed by a transmission
electron microscope (JEOL 1200EX) with an acceleration voltage of
100 kV. Prior to TEM imaging, the samples were cryo-microtomed at
−60 °C and then stained by ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) vapor.

2.4.5 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
(DMA)
DMA was conducted on a NETZSCH DMA 204C analyzer in
a three-point
bending mode at temperatures ranging from −100 to 120 °C
with the heating rate of 3 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere.
The scanning frequency was 1 Hz, and the strain amplitude was 0.05%.
The shape of the samples was rectangular strip with dimensions of
10 × 4 × 40 mm3.

2.4.6 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Differential scanning calorimetry
of samples was conducted on a
DSC instrument (Netzsch 204F1 Phoenix, Germany). All the samples (5–7
mg) were first heated from 30 to 200 °C at a heating rate of
10 °C/min and held for 5 min to eliminate the thermal history.
They were then cooled to 30 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C/min
and finally heated to 200 °C at 10 °C/min.

The glass
transition temperature (Tg), cold crystallization
temperature (Tcc), melting temperature
(Tm), cold crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc), and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) were determined in the second heating scan. The degree
of crystallinity (χc) was calculated
by the following formula 1  where ΔHm and ΔHcc are the enthalpies of
the melting and cold crystallizations during the heating, respectively;
ΔHm0 is the theoretical melting enthalpy of 100%
crystalline PLA (ΔHm0 = 93.7 J/g),10 and wf is the weight fraction of PLA
component in the blend.

2.4.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA)
The samples were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) using
a Netzsch STA-409c thermal analyzer equipment. The mass of sample
was approximately 5 mg and all the samples were heated from 30 to
600 °C using a linear heating rate of 20 °C/min under an
air flow of 50 cm3/min. All DSC and TGA values were repeated
twice and averaged to obtain representative values.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Mechanical Properties
The mechanical
properties of pure PLA, PLA/EMA–GMA binary blend, and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
nanocomposites with different contents of ZrP are presented in Figure 3, and the data of
tensile and impact properties of the composites are listed in Table 1. Figure 3a summarizes the tensile strength
and elongation at break of the pure PLA, binary blend, and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
nanocomposites. The tensile stress–strain curves and impact
strength of the compositions are shown in Figure 3b,c, respectively. As we all know, the pure
PLA is a typical brittle polymer with a low toughness; as can be seen
from Figure 3, the
tensile strength was about 67 MPa, while the impact strength and elongation
at break were only 2.9 kJ/m2 and 10.4%, respectively. The
toughness of PLA can be widely improved by the melt-blending with
EMA–GMA, which have been reported by literatures.13,20,31−34 The ductility of PLA/EMA–GMA
binary blend had been improved effectively by the toughening effect
of 15 wt % content EMA–GMA blended into the PLA matrix, its
elongation at break was 421%, about 40 times higher than pure PLA,
while the impact strength was up to 47.9 kJ/m2.

The toughness
of the PLA matrix was further enhanced by the addition
of a tiny amount of ZrP nanofiller. The trend of fracture strain and
impact strength of PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites in Figure 3 shows an increase
first and then a decrease with more ZrP loading. When the nanofiller
content is 3 wt %, the nanocomposites obtain optimum mechanical performance.
Its elongation at break is 450% and the impact strength is 65.5 kJ/m2, enhanced almost 37.6% than PLA/EMA–GMA binary blend.
The tensile strength and tensile modulus of PLA/EMA–GMA/3 wt
% ZrP composite also reach the maximum value. From the tensile stress–strain
curves in Figure 3b,
we can also see that there is a shoulder after yielding in the curves
of ZrP-containing blends, which does not appear in PLA/EMA–GMA
blend. The possible explanation for this phenomenon can be explained,
as there is a reaction between EMA–GMA and ZrP, and new chemical
bonds are produced, which absorbed the energy during the process of
drawing. As a result, the shoulder appeared.

It can be concluded
from the results of mechanical properties that
the PLA matrix changed from brittle fracture to ductile fracture due
to the synergistic effect of EMA–GMA and ZrP on PLA. A toughening
reaction was supposedly between PLA matrix, EMA–GMA phase,
and ZrP nanofiller, which will be verified by the analysis of FTIR,
DMA, micromorphology, and thermal property below.

3.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
To verify
the relative reaction between PLA, EMA–GMA, and
ZrP, FTIR spectra of the polymers and compounds were recorded in the
range of 500–4000 cm–1, which is shown in Figure 4. The stretching
vibration peaks of hydroxyl group for PLA are around 3650 and 3504
cm–1, and the hydroxyl group’s peaks of ZrP
appear at 3510 and 3594 cm–1. The characteristic
peak of the −CH3 appears at 2850 cm–1 and the peaks of epoxy group locate in 844 and 911 cm–1 for EMA–GMA.35,36

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of PLA, EMA–GMA, ZrP,
PLA/EMA–GMA, and
PLA/EMA–GMA/3 wt % ZrP.

The absorption peaks disappeared at 844 and 911 cm–1, and characteristic peaks of −CH3 at around 2850
and 2920 cm–1 corresponding to the symmetrical and
asymmetrical stretching vibrations were found in PLA/EMA–GMA
and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP blends, which indicated that there was
chemical reaction between the end hydroxyl groups and end carboxyl
groups of PLA and epoxy groups of EMA–GMA. The result has also
been confirmed by literatures.33,34,37,38 The intensity of the peak at
3594 cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibration
of the hydroxyl group for PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites was
absolutely much lower than that of nanofiller ZrP, indicating the
hydroxyl groups of ZrP reacted with the epoxy groups of EMA–GMA
and the nanofiller ZrP grafted in the molecular chain of EMA–GMA.
The reaction mechanism between PLA, ZrP, and EMA–GMA is illustrated
below.

3.3 Reaction Mechanism
From the illustration
of the chemical structure in Figure 2, we can see that PLA has hydroxyl (−OH) and
carboxyl (−COOH) groups at both ends of the molecular chain,
the characteristic structure of EMA–GMA is the epoxy group,
and hydroxyl groups are at the periphery of ZrP. So, during the process
of melt-mixing in the mixer chamber, there would be a chemical reaction
between the polymers of PLA, EMA–GMA, and inorganic filler
ZrP, which is verified by the analysis the FTIR spectra of the polymer
and compounds. Figure 5 illustrates the possible reaction between PLA, EMA–GMA, and
ZrP. The epoxy groups incorporated in EMA–GMA reacted with
both hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups located at the end of PLA
chains, and the epoxy groups of EMA–GMA reacted with hydroxyl
groups located around the ZrP chains as well. So, the EMA–GMA
will react with PLA and ZrP, respectively, by in situ grafting reaction.
Consequently, graft copolymers are formed at the interface21 and the reaction will certainly promote the
compatibility between the ternary components; the tests of DMA, SEM,
and TEM were conducted to characterize the compatibility of the blends
as follows.

Figure 5 Predicted reaction between PLA, ZrP, and EMA–GMA.

3.4 Morphological Analysis
The phase
morphologies formed during the melt-blending process plays a decisive
role in the mechanical properties for multiphase compounds. SEM and
TEM were applied to further investigate the mechanism of toughness
and phase structure of the PLA matrix incorporated with EMA–GMA
and ZrP.

The micrographs shown in Figure 6 are the impact-fractured surfaces of the
PLA/EMA–GMA blend and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites
with 1, 3, and 5 wt % ZrP. The impact-fractured surface of pure PLA
was smooth and featureless without much deformation, and the value
of impact strength was quite low, showing a typical brittle fracture
behavior.39 The fracture surface of the
binary blend became rough, while the elastomer of EMA–GMA was
incorporated, which can be seen from Figure 6A, and some plastic deformations in the fracture
surface can be seen. In Figure 6a, the EMA–GMA phases (marked in red circles) dispersed
well in the PLA matrix and there was no interface observed between
the binary phase, indicating the good compatibility between PLA and
EMA–GMA. Compared with that of the PLA/EMA–GMA binary
blend, there were more and much larger plastic deformations in the
impact-fractured surface of PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites,
and also some fibrils were observed in Figure 6B–D, which indicated that the fracture
form of the compounds transformed from brittle fracture to plastic
deformation. From Figure 6b–d and the cryofracture surface of PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
blend in Figure 7,
we can see that the nanofiller ZrP was well-wrapped by the soft phase
of EMA–GMA, which seems like a core–shell structure
in the fracture surface, and there was no obvious interface between
nanofiller ZrP and EMA–GMA phase; this is because the −OH
groups of ZrP reacted with the epoxy groups of the EMA–GMA
during the melt-blending process at high temperature and the lamellar
structure of ZrP has a large specific surface area, which can facilitate
its full contact with EMA–GMA. When the composite is impacted,
the wrapped nanofillers act as stress concentration points that distribute
the impact stress to the soft phase of EMA–GMA, which absorbs
lots of energy and then the buffered stress was conducted into the
PLA matrix evenly. As a result, the impact strength would be improved
obviously by the addition of the nanofiller ZrP into the PLA/EMA–GMA
compound.

(w/w/w) blends: (A) 85/15/0; (B) 84/15/1; (C) 82/15/3; and (D) 80/15/5.

respectively.

Figure 7 SEM micrograph of cryofracture surface of PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
(82/15/3 w/w/w) blend.

We can also see from Figure 6B–D that with
the increase in the content of ZrP there
is an increase in plastic deformation points on the impact section
of the PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP compound and the plastic deformation
also increases. So, the toughness of PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP compound
increases with the increase of the ZrP content. This is consistent
with the impact strength of PLA/EMA–GMA and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
compounds. A comparison of Figure 6C with D shows more and larger plastic deformations
in the impact section of PLA/EMA–GMA/3 wt % ZrP compound than
that of PLA/EMA–GMA/5 wt % ZrP compound. This can explain why
the impact strength of PLA/EMA–GMA/3 wt % ZrP is higher than
that of PLA/EMA–GMA/3 wt % ZrP.

The phase structures
of the PLA/EMA–GMA blend and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
composition, which were observed by SEM, were further verified by
TEM in Figure 8. Figure 8A shows the EMA–GMA
phase dispersed in the PLA matrix, which corresponds to Figure 6a. A typical mixture of core–shell
morphology is clearly seen in Figure 8B, the lamellar structure of nanofiller ZrP was wholly
wrapped by the EMA–GMA phase during the PLA matrix, which verified
the dispersion mode of ZrP in the PLA/EMA–GMA compound discussed
above.

compositions: (A) 85/15/0 and (B) 82/15/3.

3.5 Miscibility Analysis
The mechanical
properties of the compound are influenced greatly by the miscibility
of the components, for it can not only determine the phase behavior
but also the interfacial compatibility of the blends.13 The miscibility of the blends was assessed by the dynamic
mechanical analysis. The tan δ curves of pure PLA, PLA/EMA–GMA
binary blend, and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites are shown
in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Tan δ
curves of PLA, PLA/EMA–GMA, and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
blends.

In the PLA/EMA–GMA (85/15)
blend, there are two peaks of
tan δ at −31 and 81 °C, corresponding to the glass
transition temperature (Tg) of EMA–GMA
and PLA, respectively. It has been proved that EMA–GMA has
great miscibility with PLA after the compatibilization reaction during
the melt-blending process by Zhang et al.,33,34 Li et al.,37 and Wei et al.38 and the FTIR analysis above. From Figure 9, we can see that, with the
increase in the content of ZrP in PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP compounds,
the Tg peaks of EMA–GMA shift toward
to higher temperature, while there is only a tiny change in Tg of the PLA matrix with respect to pure PLA.
The Tg value was improved by 6 to −25
°C when the content of ZrP was 5 wt %, indicating the miscibility
between PLA and EMA–GMA was promoted by the addition of the
nanofiller ZrP. This is because the hydroxyl groups of ZrP can react
with the epoxy groups of EMA–GMA, and the core–shell
structure promoted the dispersion of EMA–GMA among the PLA
matrix. From Figure 9 we can also see that with increasing loading levels of ZrP, the
miscibility between PLA and EMA–GMA phases is enhanced gradually.
Since more and more ZrP were added into the PLA/EMA–GMA two-phase
system, thus the chemical reaction points are increased and the dispersion
of EMA–GMA is further promoted among the PLA matrix; therefore,
more molecular chains of PLA and EMA–GMA were involved in chemical
reactions. The results of DMA showed that the compatibility between
PLA and EMA–GMA binary phase can be promoted by the addition
of lamellar structure ZrP and the compatibilization reaction between
PLA, EMA–GMA, and ZrP was further verified.

3.6 Thermal Property
3.6.1 Melting and Crystalline
Behavior
The effect of addition ZrP filler into the PLA/EMA–GMA
blends
on the melting and crystallization behavior was studied by DSC. The
second melting scan curves of pure PLA, PLA/EMA–GMA blend,
and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites are presented in Figure 10. The detailed
results of DSC, including glass transition temperature (Tg), cold crystallization temperature (Tcc), melting temperature (Tm), cold crystallization enthalpy (ΔHcc), melting enthalpy (ΔHm), and
degree of crystallinity (χc) calculated
from the thermograms, are summarized in Table 2.

PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP
blends as prepared.

PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP (84/15/1)	60.9	120.4	165.4	28.5	32.5	5.1	
PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP (82/15/3)	60.9	120.5	165.3	28.1	31.1	3.9	
PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP (80/15/5)	60.8	123.2	165.8	28.4	31.1	3.6	
The Tg values of PLA in the PLA/EMA–GMA
binary blend and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites almost did
not change compared with that of pure PLA, which is consistent with
the result of DMA. For PLA/EMA–GMA binary blend,
the value of Tcc was increased 5.9 from
105.8 °C of pure PLA to 111.7 °C, indicated the crystallization
of PLA was restricted by the presence of the EMA–GMA phase.
Accordingly, the degree of crystallinity of the PLA/EMA–GMA
blend decreased and the melting temperature shifted to a lower temperature.
As for PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites with
only 1 wt % content of ZrP, the Tcc can be further increased by 8.7–120.4 °C
than that of PLA/EMA–GMA blend. With increase in the content
of ZrP within the nanocomposites, Tcc is
improved slightly and the melting peaks shift to a lower temperature
to 165.3 °C when the content of ZrP was 3 wt %, which is 5 °C
lower than that of pure PLA. From Table 2, we can also see that the χc of nanocomposites decreased with the increasing ZrP
content. When the presence of ZrP was 5 wt % within the nanocomposites,
the χc was only 3.6%, far below
that of pure PLA, which indicated that the crystallization of the
PLA matrix at a relative low level (0 to ca. 8%)40 did not appear to play a significant role in improving
the toughness. The trend that the crystallization decreased as the
content of ZrP increased can be explained, as there were compatibilization
reactions between ZrP nanofiller, EMA–GMA phase, and PLA matrix,
and the resulting strong interfacial interaction between the three
components limited the mobility of the PLA segments. Therefore, the
incorporation of ZrP can improve the cold crystallization temperature
and reduce the melting temperature and the degree of crystallinity
of the PLA matrix.

3.6.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA)
The influence of ZrP on the thermal degradation of
PLA was investigated
by TGA. The TGA thermograms of pure PLA, PLA/EMA–GMA blend,
and PLA/EMA–GMA/ZrP nanocomposites with different ZrP contents
are shown in Figure 11, and the TGA data, including the initial decomposed temperature
(Ti), temperature of the maximum rate
of weight loss (Tp), the final decomposed
temperature (Tf), the maximum rate of
mass loss (Rmax), and the fraction of
the residue remaining at 590 °C (Char), are presented in Table 3.

It is
obvious that the thermal degradation of pure PLA and PLA/EMA–GMA
blend started at 319 and 332.6 °C, the values of Tp are 362.4 and 364.9 °C, respectively, the final
decomposed temperatures are 373.6 and 483.3 °C, respectively,
and the elastomer of EMA–GMA has a better thermal stability
than that of pure PLA. Therefore, the presence of 15 wt % EMA–GMA
enhanced the thermal stability of PLA for EMA–GMA has great
compatibility with PLA and the mobility of the chains is restrained.

Compared with that of the PLA/EMA–GMA blend, the thermal
stability of the compatibilized blends incorporated with a nanofiller
ZrP is further improved. For example, when the ZrP content was 3 wt
%, the onset of thermal degradation was improved about 10–342.9
°C compared with that of the PLA/EMA–GMA blend and 23.9
°C compared with that of pure PLA. The Tp was improved from 364.9 °C of the PLA/EMA–GMA
blend to 370.5 °C, and the corresponding Rmax was decreased from 29.63 to 25.43%/min. One of the important
means to improve the thermal stability of polymeric materials is to
increase the char formation.41 As the content
of the nanofiller increases from 1 to 5 wt %, the percentage char
of the blends at 590 °C improved from 1.33 to 4.53%, exceeding
five times that of pure PLA. Obviously, the nanofiller of ZrP can
enhance the thermal stability of PLA in synergy with EMA–GMA
for the mobility of PLA chains was reduced and the chain transfer
reaction was suppressed; thus, the process of degradation was slowed
down and the decomposition took place at higher temperature.29,42

4 Conclusions
In this
study, supertough PLA matrix compound materials were prepared
through the method of melt-blending by the addition of 15 wt % EMA–GMA
and a small quantity of ZrP. The interfacial reaction between PLA
matrix, EMA–GMA phase, and ZrP nanofiller, verified by the
analysis of FTIR, promoted the compatibility of the nanocomposites
and changed the brittle fracture of PLA to ductile fracture. The impact
strength was improved about 22 times that of pure PLA for the nanocomposites
with 3 wt % content of ZrP, and its elongation at break was nearly
43 times that of pure PLA. The nanofiller ZrP was well-wrapped by
EMA–GMA phase to form a typical core–shell morphology
and homogeneous dispersal in the PLA matrix was revealed by SEM and
TEM. The results of DMA suggested that nanofiller ZrP can promote
the compatibility between the PLA matrix and EMA–GMA phase.
The DSC and TGA studies indicated that the nanofiller of ZrP can enhance
the thermal stability of PLA in synergy with EMA–GMA and reduce
the degree of crystallinity of the PLA matrix, which indicated that
the crystallization did not appear to play a significant role in improving
the toughness within a relative low level. The effective interfacial
compatibilization and massive shear-yielding deformation achieved
by the synergy of EMA–GMA with ZrP in the PLA matrix played
a significant role in the supertough effect of the composition.
