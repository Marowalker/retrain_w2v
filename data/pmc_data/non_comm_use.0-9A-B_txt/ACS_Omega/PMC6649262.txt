Soft chemical synthesis is used to obtain a hydrangea-type bismuth
molybdate (Bi2MoO6) supercapattery electrode
that demonstrates considerable energy/power density and cycling life.
Structure and morphology studies, initially, reveal a phase-pure polycrystalline and hydrangea-type
surface appearance for Bi2MoO6, which upon testing
in an electrochemical energy storage system displays supercapattery
behavior, a combination of a supercapacitor and a battery. From the
power law, an applied-potential-dependent charge storage mechanism
is established for the Bi2MoO6 electrode material.
A Trasatti plot evidences the presence of inner and outer surface

1 Introduction
Energy
generation, storage, harvesting, and transportation are
highly essential to maintain the cost of living in developed as well
as in underdeveloped countries as the development of any country is
more or less dependent on the availability of resources. In the upcoming years, the demand for energy will rapidly increase globally and become
10-fold higher than the present requirement; as a result there is
a need to acquire energy from modern products and services.1 Therefore, the need for enhanced-performance, inexpensive, and pollution-free or ecofriendly
energy production systems is increasing day by day. Several efforts
are being made to upgrade the performance of energy storage devices,
including supercapacitors and batteries.2 Supercapacitors have found a niche in the industrial, academic, and research market
owing to their special electrochemical properties, such as high energy/power
density, stability, galvanostatic charging and discharging processes,
impedance, etc.3,4 Various materials including carbon,5−8 transition-metal oxides,9−11 and conducting polymers12,13 have been envisaged as electrode materials in supercapacitors. Generally,
carbon-based materials demonstrate a high power density and a low
energy density but a long cycling life.14 Transition-metal oxides offer a fast and reversible surface redox
reaction with higher specific capacitance (SC) and, therefore, are
frequently preferred in commercial energy storage products.15 But poor conductivity,16 low stability,17 limited rate capability,
etc., are few of their demerits.18 Various
strategies such as tuning nanostructures at the nanoscale dimension,19,20 adatom in the host active material matrix to increase electrical
conductivity,21 and mixing two or more
active materials with a fast redox reaction22−24 were applied
successfully in the past to solve these issues to some extent. Improving
the redox reactions and electrical conductivity via mixing of two
or more metal oxides is a modern approach in metal oxides, which was
previously adopted in metal alloys; thereby, considerable research
activities are underway in this direction.25−28 Electrode materials of these
composites, sometimes called hybrid materials, demonstrate higher
electrochemical supercapacitor performance than individual components.
In addition, by forming a composite of two metal oxide electrodes
of different properties, i.e., a supercapacitor and a battery, a supercapattery
can be easily achieved.29−31 Moreover, in addition to supercapattery
performance, both conductivity and surface area of the resultant electrode
are optimum. Bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6),31−33 CoMoO4,34 NiMoO4,35 etc., are a few of these supercapattery
electrode materials. On account of its unique optical and electrical
properties, in addition to its application as a supercapacitor, Bi2MoO6 was used as a photocatalyst and a gas sensor
in the past.33,36,37 Aurivillius, since it was described by Aurivillius for the first
time, bismuth oxides demonstrate the general structural formula, (Bi2O2)2+(An–1BnO3n+1)2–, consisting of (An–1BnO3n+1)2+ perovskite layers between two (Bi2O2)2+ layers.38,39 Bi2MoO6 with different nanostructures has been used in energy storage
devices, in particular, supercapacitors, i.e., pseudocapacitors, in
the literature.29−33 However, the as-obtained SC performance of Bi2MoO6, compared to known layered double hydride electrode materials,
was lower, which could be attributed to different potential windows,
various morphologies, and synthesis processes. Thus, many research
groups are actively engaged in overcoming these issues for a better
electrochemical performance. Senthilkumar et al. reported nanoplate-like
Bi2MoO6 by a combustion method that exhibited
an SC of 342 F g–1.29 Ma et al. reported a facile hydrothermal reaction for large-scale
growth of Bi2MoO6 nanosheets and hierarchical
nanosheet-type nanotubes by a reflux method with an SC of 37.3 and
171.3 F g–1,32,33 respectively. Samdani
et al. successfully obtained Bi2MoO6 nanoplates
that demonstrated an SC of 322.85 F g–1.40 Yu et al.41 reported
flower-like Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres via
a simple hydrothermal method with SC as high as 182 F g–1. Yesuraj et al. documented electrochemical properties of aggregated
irregular Bi2MoO6 with an SC of 193 F g–1 via a sonochemical method.42

In this work, we have synthesized hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 by a simple and cost-effective wet chemical method
at ambient temperature. Ascribed to its unique and uniform structure,
special morphology and large surface area, and easy charge transport
in the electrochemical process, a better supercapattery performance
was anticipated. A symmetric supercapattery device with a Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 configuration was
assembled and electrochemical properties were measured. At the end
of this article, with this symmetric supercapattery, three differently
colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs), connected in series, were illuminated
for nearly ∼18 min with moderate brightness, evidencing the
commercial benefits of synthesized hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Growth
Mechanism
In the wet chemical method, direct formation of hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 onto Ni-foam, with a three-dimensional (3D) metal architecture,
depends on the adsorption and ion-by-ion condensation, which is highly
suitable and used in the past for producing nanostructures of mixed
metal oxides. We proposed a plausible growth mechanism for Bi2MoO6 by considering adopted synthetic conditions.
Bi2MoO6 could be a result of (a) nucleation,
(b) aggregation, (c) random arrays, and (d) crystal growth (as illustrated
in Scheme 1).

Moreover, a plausible reaction mechanism could be as follows:
the
Bi3+ ions might be attracted toward the triethanolamine
(TEA) molecule to form an unstable intermediate complex Bi[N(CH2–CH2–OH)] (eq 2). Then, NaOH solution was added into it to
increase the pH to ∼1043 (eq 3). MoO42–, obtained from the Na2MoO4·2H2O precursor solution, according to eq 4, was dissolved in deionized water
and slowly added to the Bi[N(CH2–CH2–OH)]
solution, so as to obtain a transparent and clear solution.43 This solution was kept at 353 K for 3 h. Moreover,
Bi[N(CH2–CH2–OH)] could lose its stability by activating
the bismuth sites, and a π-allyl group could coordinate to a
molybdenum ion, which is bridged by an oxygen atom forming a Bi–O–Mo
bond through MoO42–.44 At the same time, the reaction was allowed to proceed in
the same container by attaching OH– to Bi3+ to form a stable Bi2MoO4(OH)2 (eq 5) compound. Under heating
conditions, Bi2MoO4(OH)2 gradually
converted into Bi2MoO6 (eq 6). Moreover, during the transformation process,
an anisotropic growth of Bi2MoO6 could interconnect
the molecules with each other. Finally, when Bi2MoO4(OH)2 was completely transformed into Bi2MoO6, a kinetically stable Bi2MoO6 framework was obtained.45 1   2   3   4   5   6  

2.2 Morphology Evolution and
Structural Elucidation
Studies
The morphology evolution study of Bi2MoO6 is presented in Figure 1. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images scanned at high/low magnifications are displayed in Figure 1a–c, where
a uniform growth of Bi2MoO6 over Ni-foam is
evidenced (Figure S2). The general form
of the product is shown in Figure 1a, suggesting a high yield and surface uniformity.
A close-up view of the FE-SEM image shown in Figure 1b demonstrates a petal-type architecture
as in hydrangea with an average diameter of 2 (±02) μm.
From Figure 1c, it is inferred that there are a considerable number of crevices
between them as well as among individual petals, suggesting the availability
of several paths for easy electrolyte ion penetration followed by
percolation and mass transport. The high-magnification image (Figure 1c) suggests the development
of a hydrangea-type architecture composed of dozens of curly two-dimensional
(2D) nanopetals of ∼70 (±05) nm thickness. The air gap
between the petals was 580 (±20) nm. These open and free interspaced
gaps between the petals of the hydrangea-type architecture of Bi2MoO6 would be an excellent morphology for electrochemical
energy storage device applications.43 The
surface composition of Bi2MoO6 obtained from
FE-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements is shown in Figure 1d–f. A uniform
distribution of Bi, Mo, and O on the hydrangea Bi2MoO6 surface is confirmed. The spectrum showed peaks of Bi and
Mo at 2.5 eV and of oxygen at 0.5 eV, suggesting the presence of these
elements in the sample product, i.e., Bi2MoO6. The elemental mapping of Bi2MoO6, as shown in Figure S3, clearly corroborates a ratio of 24:13:63 atom %
for Bi, Mo, and O, providing the quantitative signature of Bi2MoO6. The high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) image (Figure 1g) highlights the group of petals belonging to hydrangea
with fine edges and the (Figure 1g, inset).
The obtained lattice interplanar distance of 0.32 nm in the HR-TEM
image corresponds to the (134) crystallographic plane of Bi2MoO6 (Figure 1h). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern,
shown in Figure 1i,
suggests the existence of a polycrystalline crystal structure due
to the formation of highly concentrated circular rings, rather than
spots and a foggy cloud, for Bi2MoO6. The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern was used to confirm the phase purity of
Bi2MoO6. In Figure 2a, the XRD pattern of Bi2MoO6 is presented, where the obtained sharp and well-defined diffraction
peaks were in accordance to JCPDS card no. 00-022-0112, revealing
the formation of phase-pure orthorhombic Bi2MoO6. The diffraction peaks of Bi2MoO6 appearing
at 2θ = 15.90, 27.33, 31.56, 32.63, 45.41, 53.77, and 57.22°,
as shown in Figure 2a, were assigned to the (220), (134), (414), (522), (074), (922),
and (816) crystal planes, respectively. The peak positions and respective
planes were well indexed, and there were no additional peaks detected
from impurities.

isotherms of the Bi2MoO6 electrode (inset shows

The XPS survey spectrum (see Figure 2b) clearly demonstrates
the existence of Bi, Mo, and
O elements in Bi2MoO6. Figure 2c–e shows the magnified XPS scans
of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, and O 1s. In the Bi 4f spectrum (see Figure 2c), two XPS peaks at ∼158.4
and 163.8 eV were identified, assigned to Bi3+ 4f7/2 and Bi3+ 4f5/2, respectively.43 In the Mo 3d pattern (Figure 2d), the binding energies at 231.5 and 234.7
eV were assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of
Mo6+, respectively. In Figure 2e, the peaks at 529.2 and 530.3 eV were due
to Bi–O (lattice O) and Mo–O, respectively.40 To characterize the porous nature of Bi2MoO6, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm
was measured and is shown in Figure 2f. The as-prepared Bi2MoO6 exhibited
a specific surface area of 47.11 m2 g–1. In the isotherms, the hysteresis loops
matched those of mesopores, as the average pore diameter was 13.04
nm, which, eventually, would play a significant role in the electrochemical
charge/mass transport processes by promoting the penetration of electrolyte
ions deep into an electrode material in addition to the near surface
with extensive surface redox reactions. Therefore, the as-obtained
mesoporous and high surface area hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 electrode on Ni-foam would demonstrate a better electrochemical
performance than the planar and rigid architectures.47

2.3 Electrochemical Analyses
The electrochemical
performance of the as-prepared hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 electrode was measured in a 1 M KOH solution as the electrolyte.
The SC values were measured from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic
charge–discharge (GCD) curves. Figure 3a presents the comparative cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves of blank Ni-foam and Bi2MoO6 electrodes
at a fixed scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The CV curves
recorded at different scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s–1 and in the voltage window of −1.0–0.0 V (Figure 3b) show the redox
peaks attributed to the Faradaic reactions from Bi(III) to Bi metal
of Bi2MoO6.46 The
Faradaic redox reaction of Bi2MoO6 in 1 M KOH
electrolyte is similar to that of Bi2O3. The
quasi-reversible Faradaic reactions were evidenced by the presence
of redox peaks in the CV curve (i.e., Bi3+ to Bi0). For Bi2MoO6, a single reduction peak (R1)
with high current intensity could be due to the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi0 (−0.82 V), and, on the other hand,
the two anodic peaks (O1 and O2) found at −0.48 and −0.30
V accounted for the oxidation of Bi0 to Bi metal and the
oxidation of Bi metal to Bi3+, respectively. The possible
oxidation and reduction processes taking place during the redox reaction40,46,47 could be as follows 7   8   9   10  Oxidation peaks at “O1”
and
“O2” were attributed to the presence of a minor amount
of Bi metal situated at the Bi metal/electrolyte interface, and the
oxidation peak O2 along with the voltage plateau indicated the oxidation
of Bi metal to Bi(III)48 as follows 11   12   13   14  The above equations support the occurrence
of the quasi-Faradaic signature, where with an increase in scan rate
the oxidation peak potential shifts to a more positive direction and
the reduction peak potential to the negative direction.43,49 Well-defined redox peaks in the CV profile are obtained only for Bi2O3, as it was found earlier that the molybdenum (Mo) element in Bi2MoO6 cannot participate in redox reactions.50 The molybdenum redox species could lead to the
improvement of the SC values by increasing the electrical conductivity.50 In addition to this, the anodic/cathodic peak
current position of each CV curve was increased with increasing scan
rate from 5 to 100 mV s–1, suggesting the existence
of sufficient not only electronic but also ionic transport in the
case of the Bi2MoO6 electrode51,52 (see Figure 3b).
Interestingly, the anodic/cathodic peak shifted in both potential
regions (i.e., negative and positive), with increasing scan rate due
to the occurrence of a charge diffusion polarization effect.52 As a result of the quasi-reversibility of the
material, the oxidation/reduction peaks were shifted to the positive
and negative potential sides with increasing scan rate from 5 to 100
mV s–1, which could be due to (a) high Ohmic resistance,
(b) slow electron transfer kinetics, and (c) low ionic diffusivity
of the battery-type materials.53,54 However, the redox
peaks were clearly visible even at 100 mV s–1, indicating
fast charge transfer, i.e., capacitive-type behavior in Bi2MoO6.55

SC, one of the important electrochemical parameters, decreased
with respect to the scan rate, which could be due to the low movement
and delayed interaction time of the electrolyte ions within the electrode
material. The maximum SC of 495 F g–1 was obtained
at 5 mV s–1. The total SC is the algebraic sum of
the SC contributions from the inner and outer surface charges. Therefore,
the SC contributions were determined using Trasatti plots, where the Y-intercept of the linear fit between the SC and the square
root of the scan rate (υ1/2) at υ = 0 (Figure S4a) gives the total SC, i.e., 523 F g–1 in the present case. At a lower scan rate, electrolyte
ions have unlimited access to the electrode surface; therefore, a
large amount of charge can be stored on both the inner and outer sides
of the electrode. Likewise, the Y-intercept of the
linear fit between the SC and υ–1/2 at υ
= ∞ (Figure S4b) provides the SC
contribution from the outer surface, i.e., 124 F g–1 in the present case. A prolonged time, due to a low scan rate, allows
the electrolyte ions to access majority of electrode material for
excess redox reactions. Hence, the obtained SC is that contributed
by only the inner surface. Furthermore, the SC contribution from the
inner surface was 399 F g–1. The Bi2MoO6 electrode stored a large amount of charge on the inner surface
because of the voids and crevices, providing good accessibility to
the electrolyte ions to penetrate deeply into the electrode material
and high surface area, responsible for excessive reactions.55,56 A power law was used to systematically differentiate the relative
contributions from either capacitive or battery-type mechanisms to
the total charge stored in the electrodes.57 The scan rate-dependent peak current can be defined as follows 15  where I is the current (A),
υ is the scan rate (V s–1), and a and b are adjustable parameters. The value of b was derived from the slope of the linear fit of log(υ)
against log(i) at a fixed potential (V). If the value
of b is smaller than 0.5, the current obeys a diffusion-controlled
battery-type mechanism; however, if it is above/close to 1, the material
follows a capacitive mechanism. Figure 3c shows a plot of log(i) and log(υ)
at different potentials, i.e., −0.4888, −0.4000, −0.2912,
and −0.1815 V. At the initial oxidation potential of −0.4888
V, b was 0.93, suggesting the dominance of a capacitive
mechanism in Bi2MoO6. At the peak potential
of 0.4000 V, b was 0.58, indicating the existence
of a battery-type charge storage mechanism. Subsequently, values of b were 0.65 and 0.71 at the end of the oxidation potential
range, i.e., 0.2912 and 0.1815 V, representing the involvement of
a mixed charge storage mechanism. Hence, the Bi2MoO6 electrode material could store a charge through both mechanisms.
The amount of charge stored by the battery/capacitive mechanism in
the redox peak regions was measured through a power law equation as56,57 16  It can be changed
to 17  where ip is the
peak current, and s1υ and s2υ1/2 are the current contributions
from the capacitive and intercalation mechanisms. We obtained a linear
plot for the Bi2MoO6 electrode in between ip/υ1/2 vs υ1/2 at 0.2912 V (Figure S4c), whose slope
and intercept were s1 and s2, respectively. The capacitive/intercalation current
calculated using the above equations is summarized in Figure 3d, where, at a lower scan rate,
the diffusion-controlled current was higher because the electrolyte
ions could penetrate more deeply into the Bi2MoO6 electrode material due to the hydrangea-type architecture of Bi2MoO6. At a high scan rate, the capacitive current
increased. This measurement supported the conclusion that the Bi2MoO6 electrode could have contributions from both
battery/capacitive-controlled intercalation kinetics, suggesting a
supercapattery behavior.58 To avail more
information on the capacitance properties of the Bi2MoO6 electrode, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement was
carried out. To evaluate the SC of the Bi2MoO6 electrode, GCD measurements were attempted, where the SC value decreased
from 485 to 65 F g–1 (Figure 3e). It could be due to the easy and rapid
penetration of electrolyte ions into the Bi2MoO6 electrode and the accessibility of its whole area by electrolyte
ions. The GCD curves showed two regions: a steep voltage drop region, attributed to the
internal resistance, and a prolonged plateau of voltage, due to the
involvement of a quasi-Faradaic process in the supercapattery Bi2MoO6 electrode, illustrating excellent electrochemical
reversibility with fast charge transfer kinetics.53 The Bi2MoO6 electrode could store
charge using the capacitive/battery-type mechanism in the respective
potential-dependent/independent regions.57 The SCs of the Bi2MoO6 electrode at applied
current densities are shown in Figure S5. The SC values were decreased with an increase in current density
because of the slowed migration of electrolyte ions and charge transfer
during the electrochemical reaction. The EIS (Figure 3f) plot was more vertical in the high-frequency
and low-frequency ranges, suggesting the presence of capacitive- and
battery-type contributions. In short, from the Nyquist plot, the supercapattery
nature of Bi2MoO646 is corroborated. The 0.67 Ω semi-circular diameter in the
higher frequency region, which is a charge-transfer resistance, was
considerably smaller, revealing the existence of fast transfer of
electrolyte ions across the electrolyte/electrode interface. The lower
value of around 0.52 Ω of series resistance of the Bi2MoO6 electrode confirmed a good ionic response. The electrochemical
reaction on the Bi2MoO6 electrode surface, i.e.,
a hydrangea-like architecture with arbitrary petals of high surface
area, could enhance the conductive corridors by providing shorter
diffusion routes.59 Such electrochemical
performance of the Bi2MoO6 electrode was facilitated
by many interconnecting ultrathin porous petals by affording more
active sites for efficient electrolyte ion transport on the active
material surfaces. Moreover, the open and free interspaces between
these petals and the mesoporous character of the hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 electrode could serve as ion reservoir channels,
responsible for shortening the ion diffusion length from the external
electrolyte to the interior surfaces, thus, potentially, improving
the intercalation/de-intercalation rate of ions and, thereby, increasing
the utilization of active materials.60,61 The long-term
cycle stability of electrode materials is another key factor from
the point of view of practical applications. The long-term cycle stability
of the as-prepared Bi2MoO6 electrode material
was evaluated by repeating charge–discharge tests at 5 A g–1, 5000 times. As shown in Figure 3g, it can be seen that the SCs of the Bi2MoO6 electrode material dramatically decreased
to 82% from 1 to 5000 cycles, revealing its negligible degradation.62,63Figure 3h,i show
the FE-SEM images, where no significant change in the surface appearance
of the Bi2MoO6 electrode even after 5000 sequential
cycles is noted. A few thick nanopetals of the Bi2MoO6 electrode material were destroyed after the cycling. Interestingly,
the surface of the hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 electrode collapsed upon forming a less
crystalline or amorphous structure, which eventually could be one
of the reasons for the drop in the cycling performance, as the Bi2MoO6 electrode might repeatedly undergo insertion/extraction
of OH– ions.61 The as-synthesized
Bi2MoO6 electrode material maintained considerable
quantity without disturbing the surface morphology even after 5000
cycling tests, demonstrating minimal dissolution of the active material
into the electrolyte solution. A comparative data presenting the electrochemical
performance of previously reported Bi2MoO6 electrode
materials, obtained using different synthesis methods in different
morphologies, given in Table 1 confirm the higher/comparable performance of the present
Bi2MoO6 electrode over others.

2.4 Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 Symmetric Supercapattery Device Performance
Based on the above discussions, the Bi2MoO6 electrode showed a lengthened potential window from 0.0 to 1.5 V,
and so a symmetrical supercapattery device was assembled to test its
commercial benefits. The overall process of device fabrication is
elaborated in Figure 4. For a symmetric supercapattery cell, Bi2MoO6 electrodes of the same quality (including Ni–F and mass of
Bi2MoO6) were used as negative and positive
electrodes in the presence of a polypropylene separator in a plastic
cylindrical tube (Figure 4a,b). To design a portable symmetric Bi2MoO6 electrode device, two Bi2MoO6 electrodes
were round-folded in the form of a sandwich-type structure using a
flexible polypropylene separator. The separator paper was placed between
these two electrodes so as to avoid grounded connection of the portable
device. Furthermore, these sandwiched Bi2MoO6 electrodes were inserted into a plastic cylindrical tube vertically,
as shown in Figure 4d, into which a 1 M KOH electrolyte was poured and the wire contacts
were drawn carefully from each electrode via the seal of the plastic
tube (see Figure 4d,e).
Finally, Figure 4f
demonstrates that the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 cell is ready for electrical operation process. All
electrochemical tests (CV, GCD profiling, and cycling stability) of
the Bi2MoO6 symmetric supercapattery device
were performed and reported. The CV and charge–discharge curves
of the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetric supercapattery device at different scan rates are shown
in Figure 5a,b, respectively.

device, and (f) scheme presenting cycling stability over 5000 cycles
of the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetric supercapattery device (photograph courtesy of PVS).

The Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical supercapattery device
showed decrement in the SC values
from 40.5 to 25 F g–1 as the current densities increased
from 1 to 5 F g–1 (Figure 5c). The Ragone plot of the symmetric supercapattery
device at different current densities is given in Figure 5d, where the above results
were based on the mass of the two active electrodes. It can be understood
that the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical supercapattery device exhibited a remarkable energy
density/power density (45.6 W h kg–1/989 W kg–1), which is greater than those of symmetrical cells
reported previously for CS@Bi2MoO6//CS@Bi2MoO6 (10.8 W h kg–1/410 W kg–1),40 RuO2/graphene//RuO2/graphene (11 W h kg–1/76 W kg–1),64 Ni@FeCo2O4@MnO2//Ni@FeCo2O4@MnO2 (22.2 W
h kg–1/978.3 kW kg–1),65 and GR/BiVO4//GR/BiVO4 (45.69 W h kg–1/800 kW kg–1)66 devices. The energy density/power density value
(45.6 W h kg–1/989 W kg–1) obtained
in the present work was appealing. Electrochemical charge storage
mechanisms of the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetric supercapattery are displayed briefly as a schematic
in Figure 5e.

In addition, to check the practical feasibility of the as-developed
Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical
supercapattery device, three cells were connected in series and charged
through an external power source (at 4.5 V voltage) for 5 min and
finally discharged through three differently colored LEDs, where the
LEDs with considerable light intensities were illuminated for ∼18
min without any fluctuation, demonstrating the promising future of
the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical
cell device (Figure 6a–i).

devices with time (photograph courtesy of PVS et al.).

Figure 6a presents
an assembly of the three Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical supercapattery devices in series with
a panel of three differently colored (green, yellow, and red) LEDs. Figure 6b highlights an actual
image at the initial glowing time of less than 1 min, Figure 6c–f display images with
nearly 5 min time intervals that remained almost the same up to ∼17
min, then the green LED was turned off (Figure 6g). After a few seconds, the yellow LED went
off (see Figure 6h)
and lastly, the red LED stopped glowing after 30 s (see Figure 6i), suggesting the importance
of the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical device with moderate energy/power density in developing
supercapattery devices. The stability of the Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 symmetrical supercapattery
device was tested using GCD operations, and the results are displayed
in Figure 5f. Over
about 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g–1, the SC based on the total mass of the two electrodes was about
31.6 F g–1, which corresponds to 78% of its initial
capacitance (40.5 F g–1), evidencing the moderate
chemical stability and mechanical robustness of the as-fabricated
hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 symmetric supercapattery
device before its commercial use.

3 Conclusions
In summary, hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 with upright
standing narrow petals (separated by a considerable number of crevices)
of high surface area was successfully synthesized by a simple and
inexpensive wet chemical method. These special properties of Bi2MoO6 would lead to a smaller ion diffusion length
and an easy electrolyte ion transfer for better electrode surface
utilization and performance. In the electrochemical studies, the hydrangea-type
Bi2MoO6 electrode exhibited an SC of 485 F g–1 at 5 A g–1 and supercapattery character.
A symmetric supercapattery device assembly of Bi2MoO6 delivered an energy density of 45.6 W h kg–1 at a power density of 989 W kg–1. Finally, the
symmetric supercapattery device successfully illuminated three differently
colored LEDs with their maximum intensity. With this motivation, future
work to synthesize and design other binary metal oxides/sulfides/selenides,
etc., in 2D and 3D morphologies for various applications, such as
in gas sensors, solar cells, electrocatalysts for water splitting,
etc., is underway.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate
[Bi(NO3)3·5H2O], sodium molybdate
dehydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), sodium
hydroxide (NaOH), and triethanolamine (TEA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) was obtained from Junsei
Chemical. All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without
any further purification.

4.2 Bi2MoO6 Synthesis
The synthesis of Bi2MoO6 via a wet chemical
method was considered. Briefly, a solution of 0.1 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dissolved in 5 mL of HNO3 and 4 mL of triethanolamine (TEA) was prepared in 50 mL of deionized
water. A 0.1 M NaOH solution was mixed with constant stirring by maintaining
a speed of 150 rpm so as to form a clear transparent solution (∼10.5
pH).43 Finally, 0.2 M Na2MoO4·2H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized
water. A clear solution was formed and the Na2MoO4 solution was added into the above mixed solution. The whole solution
mixture was stirred for 1 h and then well-cleaned pieces of Ni-foam
(3 × 3 cm2) were inserted vertically into the solution,
and the reaction was allowed to run at 353 K for 3 h. At the end of
the reaction time, whitish Bi2MoO6 directly
deposited on the Ni-foam, which was washed with deionized water several
times, dried, and air-annealed at 427 K for 2 h for removing any residual
hydroxide species. The formation of Bi2MoO6 was
evidenced as the white product was changed to a biscotti-type product
(synthesis process is given in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). Further, various characterization
tools and electrochemical analyses were employed for physical and
electrochemical measurements, as discussed earlier.9,43
