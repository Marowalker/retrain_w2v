Biomaterial-associated
infection and lack of sufficient osseointegration contribute to a
large proportion of implant failures. Therefore, antibacterial and
osseointegration-accelerating properties are important in implant
surface design. In this study, a micro/nanoporous titanium surface
was prepared through alkaline and heat treatments, covalently conjugated
with aminosilane. Then, varying amounts of chlorhexidine (CHX) were
covalently grafted onto the aminosilane-modified surface via glutaraldehyde
to obtain different CHX-grafted surfaces. These as-prepared surfaces
were evaluated in terms of their surface chemical composition, surface
topography, CHX grafting amount, antibacterial activity, and osteoblast
compatibility. The results showed that the CHX grafting amount increased
with increasing CHX concentrations, leading to better antibacterial
activity. CHX (1 mg/mL) resulted in the best antibacterial surface,
which still retained good osteoblast compatibility. Meanwhile, competitive
bacterial-cell adhesion analysis demonstrated that this surface has
great value for osteoblast adhesion at the implant–bone interface
even in the presence of bacteria. This effortless, easily performed,
and eco-friendly technique holds huge promise for clinical applications.

Introduction
Because of their excellent integrated performance (biocompatibility,
mechanical properties, and low density), titanium and its alloys are
considered to be the best materials for dental implants (DI).1 However, during the early stages of implantation,
peri-implant infections and poor osseointegration lead to the loss
of tissue support for the implant and sometimes even treatment failure,2 requiring costly rectification and often distressing
the patient.

Planktonic bacteria first adhere onto the DI surface
and then proliferate and produce extracellular polymeric substances,
ultimately progressing to highly structured biofilms and leading to
peri-implant infections involving peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis.3,4 Upon biofilm formation on the biomaterial, the metabolism and antibiotic
susceptibility of bacteria within the biofilm change such that the
minimal inhibitory concentration of bacteria in the biofilm can increase
by as much as 1000-fold for planktonic bacteria.5 Through this defensive environment, bacteria have the capacity
to evade the host’s guards/safeguards and counter antibiotic
attacks. Furthermore, biofilm-related antibiotic resistance might
be intensified by the enhanced competence suggested for biofilm-embedded
bacteria.6 Then, a series of undesirable
consequences can be triggered, including underlying life-threatening
general infections, tissue damage, device failure/malfunction, and
ultimately, removal of the implant. Compared with conventional approaches,
including antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention, a better method
to inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation is to engineer
implant surfaces with antibacterial coatings that prevent bacterial
adherence and/or kill bacteria7 These as-prepared
coatings could allow drugs’ loading in vivo at the implantation
site, which antibiotics might have difficulty reaching,8 increase retention time and lower drug dose levels
to reduce unwanted side effects,9 and maintain
the bulk properties of the material.

Antibacterial coatings
on DI surfaces are divided into drug-eluting coatings for the release
of antibacterial agents to prevent bacterial adhesion and kill bacteria
and permanent antibacterial coatings containing permanently bonded
antibacterial drugs to prevent long-term bacterial adhesion. Antibacterial
agents for delivery via drug-eluting coatings include (1) antibiotics
such as gentamicin and vancomycin, (2) antiseptics such as chlorhexidine
(CHX), and (3) metals such as silver and copper.10,11 However,
supratherapeutic levels of antibacterial drugs released from many
elution coatings can be maintained for only a limited period of time,
after which point, lower levels continue to be released for some time
afterward.12 This is problematic because
an initial burst of drugs can be toxic to the already compromised
bone13 and transform a small fraction of
bacteria into persistent cells, and the subsequent exponential decline
in drugs to subtherapeutic levels can allow the bacteria to resume
proliferation,14 leading to antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.7 Permanent antibacterial coatings
depend on covalently linked antibacterial drugs on the DI surface
to destroy adherent bacteria. Compared with elution coatings, the
amount of antibacterial agents on a permanent surface is small to
reduce toxicity to the compromised bone.15 However, the surface-bound drugs appear to retain their activity
and exhibit good stability compared to free drugs,16 and thus permanent surfaces can produce a long-term antibacterial
environment. Tethered antibacterial compounds include various chitosans
and quaternary ammonium salts,7 antibacterial
peptides,17 and antibiotics.18 Antibacterial compounds can be linked onto these
surfaces by different cross-linkers including sulfhydryl bonds19 and aminopropyltriethoxysilane.20 However, when engineering an antibacterial coating, a balance
must be maintained between the antibacterial property and cytocompatibility
for implant–bone interfaces.

A three-dimensional micro/nanoporous
structure possesses the typical features of native bone tissue, superior
bioactivity, and inferior elastic modulus1,21 to
optimize the osteointegration of the DI through enlargement of the
specific surface area to improve osteoblast proliferation and differentiation
and bone ingrowth.22,23 Even though the surface structure
is an important factor in osteointegration, the implant is rendered
extremely susceptible to bacterial colonization and subsequent biofilm
formation due to the large surface area created by the overall open
porosity and pore size.2 Therefore, it
is important to prepare DI surfaces that couple both a porous structure
to promote osseointegration and antibacterial properties to prevent
infection.

With its wide-spectrum antibacterial activity in
physiological environments, chlorhexidine (CHX) has been utilized
in clinical treatments as a topical antimicrobial, scrub agent, and
lavage fluid,24 and has been described
as a good candidate for the development of materials and devices with
antibacterial properties that do not encourage microbial evolution
similar to antibiotic resistance, which is of acute concern to the
global community.25 CHX has been loaded
into hydroxyapatite nanocapsules26 or incorporated
into polymeric systems27 to sustain its
release. However, only a few studies have utilized covalent linkage
to graft CHX onto materials to prevent biomaterial-associated infection.
Daud et al. reported that tethering CHX onto 316LSS via polydopamine
had a long-term antibacterial effect, but there was no mention of
cytocompatibility.28 Aminosilanes are used
extensively to bond biomolecules onto different materials via hydroxyl
groups on the surface,29 and our previous
study involved covalent bonding of aminopropyltriethoxysilane to metal
oxides to form a self-assembled monolayer with numerous amine groups.
These amines can act as a starting point for covalent grafting with
poly(ethylene glycol) to endow the surface with antifouling properties.30,31

Therefore, the present study aimed to build porous titanium
surfaces modified with aminosilanes and covalently grafted with different
amounts of CHX and then evaluate the antibacterial activity and osteoblast-compatibility
performance of surface with given amounts of CHX. For this purpose,
an aminosilane was applied for modification of a porous titanium substrate
obtained by alkaline treatment. Then, varying amounts of CHX were
covalently grafted onto the aminosilane-modified surface via glutaraldehyde
(Figure 1B). Finally,
the antibacterial properties and osteoblast compatibility of the resulting
titanium surfaces were evaluated in vitro to forecast the retention
of the coating after implantation. This method, through which implant
surfaces with efficient antibacterial activity and bioactivity can
be constructed, will have an impact on dental and relevant orthopedic
fields.

Results and Discussion
Surface Characterization
The surface morphologies
of Ti, pTi, pTi-Sil, pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 are shown in Figure 2. Compared with compact flat titanium (Ti),
NaOH treatment created a uniform micro/nano porosity and a mesh-like
surface topography (pTi), leading to a large surface area. Kozlovsky
et al. suggested that an increase in surface roughness was beneficial
for CHX absorption and then demonstrated the substantial antibacterial
effect provided through enlargement of the surface area.32 Silanization (pTi-Sil) reduced the pore size,
and then the grafted CHX (pTi-Sil-CHX) further reduced the pore size
with increasing CHX concentrations. Daud et al. also reported that
the amount of CHX adsorption on substrates increases with the CHX
concentration, and the adsorbed CHX from higher CHX concentration
solutions forms more/larger CHX aggregates to cover the surface.28

Figure 2 Surface
morphologies of Ti, pTi, pTi-Sil, pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was used to analyze the chemical compositions of surfaces in different
phases. The XPS wide-scan spectra of pTi, pTi-Sil, pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 are shown in Figure 3A. The XPS wide-scan spectrum of pTi-Sil showed the presence of N
1s, Si 2s, and Si 2p peaks and a decrease in the Ti 2p peak, indicating
that aminosilane was successfully coated onto the titanium surface.
CHX conjugation to the aminosilanized surface led to a reduction in
the Ti 2p and Si peaks, an increase in the N 1s peaks, and the presence
of Cl 2p peaks, demonstrating that CHX was successfully grafted onto
the surface of pTi-Sil. To illustrate the reaction mechanisms of CHX
conjugation, N 1s (Figure 3B) and C 1s (Figure 3C) peak fittings were further carried out, and the detailed
information is shown in Table 1. Compared with the spectrum of pTi-Sil, a new peak in the
high-resolution N 1s spectra at ∼400.5 eV (Figure 3B and Table 1/N2) and a new peak in the high-resolution
C 1s spectra at ∼287.4 eV (Figure 3C and Table 1/C4) occurred for pTi-Sil-CHX, which was consistent
with the formation of C–N/R=N–R′ groups
and C=N/C–Cl groups, illustrating that CHX was successfully
grafted onto the surface. Among the three CHX-grafted surfaces, the
area percentage of C–N/aromatic N (399.6 eV, Table 1/N1) in N 1s and C–C
(284.6 and 285.6 eV, Table 1/C1 and C2) in C 1s with 62.9 and 56.1%, respectively, were
both the highest for pTi-Sil-CHX1.0, while that of C=N/C–Cl
(287.7 eV, Table 1/C4)
in total C 1s was the lowest, with only 14%, indicating that the benzene
rings were exposed on the top surfaces rather than the guanidyl groups
(Figure 1B). After
immobilization of CHX, a new peak of C=O (288.4 eV, Table 1/C5) appeared in pTi-Sil-CHX0.1 and pTi-Sil-CHX0.5 (Figure 3C), which corresponded to the C=O
groups in glutaraldehyde, but the proportion of this peak decreased
from 32.7 to 17% when the concentration of CHX rose from 0.1 to 0.5
mg/mL, and the peak disappeared in pTi-Sil-CHX1.0. Chances
are that with a higher CHX dose, more reactions occurred between the
C=O groups in glutaraldehyde and the guanidyl in CHX, thus
leading to an increased grafting amount of CHX on the surfaces. The
high-resolution Cl 2p spectra of the pTi-Sil-CHX surface at 202.4
eV for Cl 2p1/2 and 200.8 eV for Cl 2p3/2 further
illustrated that CHX was successfully grafted onto the surface (Figure 3D). The Cl 2p spectra
of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 were found to be different from that
of pTi-Sil-CHX0.1 and pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, while
the Cl 2p spectrum of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 was in agreement with
a previous report investigating CHX-modified 316 L stainless-steel
surfaces prepared by soaking dopamine-coated stainless steel in 44.9
mg/mL of CHX solution,33 indicating that
the molecular conformation of the grafted CHX changed with the CHX
concentration.

The chemical elemental semiquantitative results
of the different surfaces from the high-resolution spectra are shown
in Table 2. Compared
with pTi and pTi-Sil, a sharp decline in the titanium content and
steep increases in the carbon and nitrogen contents were observed
on the aminosilanized surface, demonstrating that the aminosilane
was coated on the top of the Ti surface. Successful CHX incorporation
onto the aminosilanized surface was demonstrated by decreases in the
oxygen and titanium content, as well as significant increases in the
carbon, nitrogen, and chlorine contents. Because there is no oxygen
in CHX, the oxygen content decreased as the CHX solution concentration
increased in the CHX-decorated surface groups, indirectly indicating
that the CHX grafting amount increased as the concentration of the
CHX solution increased. Meanwhile, the nitrogen content decreased
and the carbon content increased with increasing CHX concentrations,
also indicating that the molecular conformation of CHX changed to
expose the benzene rings on the top surface and embed guanidyl into
the subsurface. The N/Cl ratios of pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 were calculated to be 4.95,
5.40, and 7.07, respectively. A previous study reported that the N/Cl
ratio of a CHX-decorated surface prepared at a CHX concentration of
44.9 mg/mL was calculated to be 7, which is in good agreement with
the results of the sample of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0.33 Because the theoretical stoichiometric ratio
of CHX is 5, the high N/Cl ratio of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 indicated
that the molecular conformation of the grafted CHX on pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 was different from that on pTi-Sil-CHX0.1 and
pTi-Sil-CHX0.5. Speculation regarding the molecular conformation
of the grafted CHX on pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 is that contortion
leads to the exposure of the benzene ring on the top surface, covering
the guanidyl group (Figure 1C).

The water contact angle (WCA) reflects the wettability
of a substrate and has been used in a wide range of studies to assess
the efficacy of surface modification methods. Figure 4A shows the WCA values of the different surfaces.
Compared with the original Ti (82.5 ± 4.9°), the WCA value
of pTi decreased sharply to 7.4 ± 0.3°. After silanization
(pTi-Sil), the WCA value increased significantly to 121.9 ± 1.3°,
but CHX made the surface hydrophilic, and the WCA value of pTi-Sil-CHX
significantly decreased. With increasing CHX concentrations, there
was an increase in the surface hydrophilicity, and the WCA values
of pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 were 106.6 ± 3.3, 64.2 ± 5.9, and 39.5 ±
3.7°, respectively. These results indirectly indicate that aminosilane
and CHX were successfully grafted onto the micro/nanoporous titanium
surfaces.

Figure 4 (A) Water contact angles
of different surfaces. (B) Quantification of NH groups measured by
the AO II method

The quantitative NH amounts on the surface obtained
by labeling with AO II using a linear standard curve (optical density
vs concentration) are shown in Figure 4B. Spectrometric analysis of the stained samples showed
that the surface of pTi-Sil possessed the largest NH amount, indicating
that aminosilane was successfully incorporated onto the micro/nanoporous
titanium surfaces. However, the NH groups on pTi-Sil were entirely
consumed after glutaraldehyde treatment (pTi-Sil-GA), and a schematic
of the possible GA linkage on the titanium surface is shown in Figure 1C. Thus, the NH content
on the CHX-grafted surfaces was derived from the CHX molecules. Compared
with pTi-Sil-GA, the NH amount on CHX-grafted surfaces significantly
increased, but significantly decreased as the concentration of the
CHX solution increased, indicating that CHX was successfully grafted
onto micro/nanoporous titanium surfaces and that molecular contortion
occurred much more frequently in the high CHX concentration group
than in the low-concentration group, leading to exposure of the benzene
ring on the top surface, which obscured the guanidyl group.

Quantification of the CHX grafted on the surfaces determined via
UV–vis with a linear standard curve (optical density vs concentration)
is shown in Table 3. The CHX grafting amount increased as the concentration of the CHX
solution increased and was 0.44 ± 0.15 μg for pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, 2.59 ± 0.42 μg for pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and 3.98 ± 0.31 μg for pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 because
higher CHX concentrations facilitated the formation of more/larger
CHX aggregates and then led to higher CHX immobilization.28 Meanwhile, the utilization rates of CHX in the
solution for surface grafting were 2.2% for pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, 2.59% for pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and 2% for pTi-Sil-CHX1.0, which were far higher than the approximately 1% reported
in a previous study.28 Thus, the CHX application
amount and utilization rate in this method led to less waste compared
with the method used in the previous study.

Antibacterial Activity
Adherence of bacteria to implanted
devices and planktobacteria around implanted devices can lead to biomaterial-associated
infections, often resulting in severe disease and implant failures.
The antibacterial activity of the different samples in the local environment
was investigated via zone of inhibition (ZOI) and optical density
measurements. Clear transparent circles (inhibition zone) were observed
around the CHX-grafted surfaces, and the size of the circles increased
as the concentration of the CHX solution increased, showing the antibacterial
effects of these surfaces (Figure 5A). Monitoring of the bacterial growth in solution
was carried out by measuring the optical density at 660 nm (OD660)
(Figure 5B). The higher
the OD, the greater the opacity, based on the turbidity of the cell
suspension. Compared with the surfaces without CHX, the CHX-grafted
surfaces exhibited strong inhibition of Staphylococcus
aureus growth after 24 h of culture, but the antibacterial
activity of pTi-Sil-CHX0.1 disappeared after 48 h of culture.
On the other hand, when the CHX concentration was raised to 0.5 and
1.0 mg/mL, the sample surfaces still inhibited bacterial growth after
48 h. However, the antibacterial effect of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 was found to not only last longer but to be stronger because it
almost entirely restrained bacteria growth.

samples. (C) Plate count of S. aureus adhered onto the different samples (subset: photograph of bacteria
colonies on the solid LB agar plates). (D) Biofilm formation by S. aureus on different surfaces, measured using the
crystal violet method.

Bacterial adherence
to implanted materials can lead to biomaterial-associated infections,
often causing severe complications and implant failures. The antibacterial
activity of the different surfaces was investigated using live/dead
bacteria staining and the plate counting method. Here, an in situ
viability assessment of bacteria was carried out using a commercially
available kit for live/dead bacterial fluorescence staining after
24 h of cultivation on various surfaces. As shown in Figure 6, the samples of Ti, pTi, and
pTi-Sil supported rapid and extensive attachment of S. aureus. However, the number of bacteria adhered
on the pTi-Sil was less than that on the pTi, and the percentages
of apoptotic cells (yellow) and dead cells (red) were higher than
those on the pTi, indicating that the positive charge increased the
antibacterial activity.34 Meanwhile, attachment
onto the CHX-grafted surfaces was reduced by more than 80% compared
with that on the pTi. Most of the bacterial cells on the CHX-grafted
surfaces were dead (stained red), which was indicative of the high
efficiency of CHX modification in prevention of bacterial adhesion
and in killing of adherent bacteria. Among the CHX-grafted surfaces,
the number of adhered bacteria decreased as the concentration of the
CHX solution increased. CHX (1 mg/mL) produced the best antibacterial
surface with the lowest number of bacteria and the highest proportion
of dead bacterial. The number of bacteria on the different surfaces
was determined by the dilution and plate counting method. After 24
h of culture, the bacteria adhered on the samples were dispersed into
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then cultured on the surface of
solid LB agar plates for visible testing of the bacteria count (Figure 5C). Bacterial colonies
were visibly observed in connection with pTi and pTi-sil, but the
number of bacterial colonies decreased with increasing concentrations
of CHX in the CHX-decorated surface groups. The colony-forming unit
(CFU) number of pTi-Sil-CHX0.1 ((1.01 ± 0.18) ×
106) decreased slightly compared to pTi ((1.72 ± 0.35)
× 106) and pTi-Sil ((1.49 ± 0.40) × 106), while pTi-Sil-CHX0.5 ((0.24 ± 0.11) ×
106) caused significant reduction. The highest reduction
was noted for pTi-Sil-CHX1.0, without any CFU counted.
This result also demonstrated that 1 mg/mL of CHX produced the best
antibacterial surface with the lowest number of live bacteria.

Figure 6 Fluorescence images of S. aureus on
the different surfaces, visualizing live cells (green), dead cells
(red), and apoptotic cells (yellow).

The results of assessments of the adherence of bacteria onto the
titanium surface and the bacteria growth in the local environment
indicated that the grafted CHX improved the antibacterial activity
of the samples and that the inhibitory effect was enhanced with an
increase in the CHX grafting amount. The greatest antibacterial effect
was observed when the surface was prepared with a CHX solution concentration
of 1 mg/mL. Previous studies have also suggested that CHX-decorated
surfaces possess excellent antibacterial properties,28,33,35 but the CHX concentration in
these studies was far higher than 1 mg/mL. Therefore, our study provides
evidence that the use of such high CHX concentration solutions to
prepare the CHX-decorated surfaces is unnecessary; still, an excessively
low concentration of CHX is inadequate to produce a satisfactory antibacterial
surface.

Because bacterial biofilms are inherently resistant
to antibiotics and the human immune system, bacterial biofilms may
lead to treatment failure as a consequence of persistent infection.
To evaluate the ability of the surfaces to inhibit biofilm formation,
biofilms were formed using an S. aureus monospecies biofilm model and then were examined by the colorimetric
measurement of crystal violet incorporation by sessile cells (Figure 5D). The biofilm amount
formed on pTi and pTi-Sil surfaces was higher than that on the CHX
surfaces, confirming the efficacy of CHX to impede the formation of
bacterial biofilms on the material surfaces. Furthermore, the suppression
of biofilm formation varied among the experimental groups according
to the usage of CHX (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg/mL), and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 was found to have the best inhibitory effect.

Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) photographs of S. aureus on pTi and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 in vitro after 48 h of incubation
are shown in Figure 7. A thick biofilm formed on the pTi surface, covering the micro/nanoporous
titanium surface, whereas the surface of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 retained its porous structure. Moreover, pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 exhibited an antibiofilm effect and disrupted biofilm formation,
and most of the adherent S. aureus were
dead (red arrows).

Figure 7 SEM photographs of S. aureus on pTi and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 after
48 h of incubation.

To evaluate the stability of the coating,
the samples of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 were immersed in PBS for
3 and 7 days and then their antibacterial properties were assessed
via live/dead bacteria staining (Figure 8A). The number of bacteria adhered on the
CHX-modified surfaces was far less than that on the pTi surface, indicating
that the CHX-modified surfaces with or without immersion in PBS possessed
antibacterial activity. However, with increasing immersion times in
PBS, the amount of bacteria on pTi-Sil-CHX1.0-3d and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0-7d greatly increased, indicating that the antibacterial
activity of these surfaces decreased. We speculate that hydrolysis
of the silanes might result in a decrease in the amount of CHX bound
on the material surface.36 However, the
percentages of apoptotic cells (yellow) and dead cells (red) on pTi-Sil-CHX1.0-3d and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0-7d were higher than those
on pTi, indicating that these surfaces still had good bactericidal
activity. To some extent, the lasting sterilization might remedy the
defect in inhibition of bacterial adhesion, and thus, the antibacterial
activity did not appear to decrease with an extension of immersion
time. However, although the number of adherent bacteria on the surface
continued to grow, the early stage of healing can be achieved within
5 days; a previous study reported that an initial mucosal seal could
be established by the 4th day after the implant placement.37 In addition, silane hydrolysis might expose
the porous substrate to promote bone integration.22,23

Osteoblast Compatibility
Many
antibacterial agents that can endow dental implants with antibacterial
activity have been actively studied too, but these agents lack biocompatibility.30,38 Cytotoxicity and internal organ injury2,39 caused by the
as-prepared surfaces are problems that must be solved.40,41 The cytotoxicity toward the mouse osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cell
line, as another crucial factor, should be evaluated with caution
once a newly modified Ti is used as a DI. Figure 9 shows the in vitro cell viability cultured
with the different samples in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium for 1 and 3 days, assessed with an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The viability of cells cultured on pTi was higher
than that of those cultured on the CHX-decorated Ti surfaces, indicating
that modification of the Ti surface with CHX led to some cytotoxicity
that affected cell adhesion and proliferation, but only the viability
of cells grown pTi-Sil-CHX0.5 for 1 day showed significant
differences from the pTi group. After 3 days of incubation, the pTi
groups still showed higher cell viability than the CHX-grafted Ti
counterparts, but the cells cultured with these samples showed no
significant differences in cell viability. Among the three types of
CHX-grafted Ti, cells on the pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 maintained
better viability at all times, and at 3 days, the viability value
was very similar to that of cells on the pTi.

Figure 9 Osteoblast proliferation
on different surfaces after culture
for 1 and 3 days, as determined by an MTT assay

To observe the
morphologies of the cells adhered on the different surfaces after
1, 3, and 5 days of culture, rhodamine123 was used to stain the cellular
matrix (Figure 10).
As the culture time increased, the number of cells attached on each
sample grew. After 1 day of culture, the sizes and numbers of adherent
cells on the pTi and pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 were greater than those
on other surfaces. Meanwhile, the number of adherent cells on pTi-Sil-CHX0.5 was less than that on the other surfaces, which indicated
that this surface was not favorable for osteoblast adhesion. After
3 days of culture, the number of cells adhered on each sample increased,
and the adhered cells spread pseudopodia and had healthy spindle shapes,
but adhered cells on the CHX-grafted Ti were unevenly distributed
throughout the surface. Compared with pTi, a nearly equal amount of
cells could be observed on pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 and the cells
covered nearly the entire surface at 5 days, indicating that the CHX-decorated
surface at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL did not inhibit cell attachment
or growth on the Ti substrates. Meanwhile, the cells on pTi-Sil-CHX0.1 and pTi-Sil-CHX0.5 were flattened and exhibited
a smaller attachment area than the other samples, which was in accordance
with the MTT results. One possible reason for the good cytocompatibility
of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 is that the benzene ring of the grafted
CHX on pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 is exposed on the top surface and
covers the guanidyl group, resulting in surfaces with a low positive
charge.

Competitive Bacterial-Cell
Adhesion
During the implantation operations, bacteria can
be brought into the implant–bone interface by the implant,
saliva, and blood, which leads to infection. To simulate the possible
problems caused by infection during the clinical implantation process,
samples were incubated with bacteria and cells in sequence to evaluate
the importance of surface modification. The results showed that the
pTi surface was occupied by a large number of bacteria and a small
number of cells (Figure 8B) after 1 day of coculture, and most of the cells exhibited red
fluorescence, indicating that the cells had been destroyed. Conversely,
the CHX-grafted surface was covered by a large number of green (living)
cells with good cell morphology, and very few dead bacterial cells
(stained red) were observed. The surface of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 exhibited high efficiency in destroying the bacterial cells and
supported cell adhesion. After 3 days of coculture, a thick biofilm
and very few apoptotic cells (stained yellow) were observed on the
pTi surface, while a large number of cells but no bacteria were observed
on the pTi-Sil-CHX1.0, and the adhered cells exhibited
spread pseudopodia and a healthy spindle shape. These results demonstrate
that in the cell-bacteria competition environment, if the bacteria
cannot be effectively inhibited, rapid proliferation and colonization
occur on the material surface, thereby restricting cell adhesion and
even causing cell death.

Conclusions
Micro/nanoporous titanium surfaces grafted with different amounts
of CHX using aminosilane and glutaraldehyde as chemical cross-linkers
were evaluated in terms of the surface chemical composition, surface
topography, CHX grafting amount, antibacterial activity, and osteoblast
compatibility. CHX-grafted coatings were successfully prepared on
micro/nanoporous titanium surfaces, while the CHX grafting amount
increased with increasing CHX concentrations, further leading to better
antibacterial activity. CHX (1 mg/mL) yielded the best antibacterial
surface, and this surface retained the good osteoblast compatibility
of titanium. Bacterial-cell competitive adhesion assays demonstrated
that the antibacterial surface of pTi-Sil-CHX1.0 has great
value for osteoblast adhesion at the implant–bone interface
even in the presence of bacteria. Therefore, a CHX-grafted coating
on the micro/nanoporous structure (pTi-Sil-CHX1.0) may
not only prevent infection but also retain good osteoblast compatibility
for further osteointegration of titanium implants. This effortless,
easily performed, and eco-friendly technique holds huge promise for
clinical applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Commercial
pure titanium (Ti) was purchased from Baoji Nonferrous Metal Co.,
Ltd. (Shanxi Province, China). 3-Aminopropyl(diethoxy)methylsilane
(aminosilane), chlorhexidine acetate (CHX), glutaraldehyde, acid orange
II (AO II), crystal violet, and rhodamine123 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Fetal bovine serum and α-minimum Eagle’s medium were
purchased from Gibco. S. aureus and
the mouse MC3T3-E1 cell line were purchased from ATCC.

Fabrication and Characterization of the CHX-Modified
Surfaces
Titanium disks were polished to achieve a reflective,
mirror-like surface, followed by ultrasonic cleaning first in acetone,
then in ethanol and finally in deionized water. After immersion in
a 5 M NaOH solution at 60 °C for 12 h, the cleaned specimens
were immersed in boiling deionized water for 2 h (denoted pTi) and
subsequently soaked in a 1% (v/v) ethanol solution of 3-aminopropyl(diethoxy)methylsilane
for 10 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. After the reaction, the
samples were ultrasonically cleaned with the same solvents and then
kept in a 120 °C oven for 2 h to enhance binding of the aminosilane
with the surface (denoted pTi-Sil). The samples of pTi-Sil were immersed
in a 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 4 h at room temperature
(RT), and then, any ungrafted moieties on the surface were washed
away with water (denoted pTi-Sil-GA). CHX at three different concentrations
(0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) were grafted onto the surfaces separately
by soaking the modified samples in 0.2 mL of CHX solution for 24 h.
The CHX-grafted samples were washed with deionized water three times
and then placed in a vacuum system for further use. The samples were
denoted pTi-Sil-CHX0.1, pTi-Sil-CHX0.5, and
pTi-Sil-CHX1.0.

After coating with gold for 30 s,
the surface topographies of the different samples were investigated
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The surface
chemical composition was analyzed via XPS (Thermo ESCALAB 250) at
a pass energy of 100 eV over a wide scan with a binding energy (BE)
range of 0–1400 eV; meanwhile, the elemental states of the
different samples were analyzed at a pass energy of 30 eV to produce
high-resolution detailed scans. The system was calibrated using the
C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Because the take-off angle was set to 45°,
the investigation depth was no more than 10 nm. The Xpspeak software
package was used to perform quantitative analysis and curve fitting
for the collected data. The wettability of the different surfaces
was investigated by measuring the water contact angle using deionized
water at room temperature. Measurements were made on five samples
from each group, and each sample was separately measured twice.

An improved AO II assay was performed to quantify the density of
the surface amine groups (primary, secondary, and tertiary).31 Two milliliters of AO II aqueous solution (500
μmol/L, pH 3) was incubated with the samples for 24 h at RT,
and then the samples were removed from the solution and rinsed with
water (pH 3) five times. Finally, the samples were shaken for 12 h
in water (pH 12) to release the adsorbed AO II. A colorimetric method
was applied to determine the AO II concentration of the solution using
a microplate photometer (μQuant, BioTek, Winooski, VT) with
an optical spectrometer at 485 nm. The amine amounts on the different
surfaces were calculated according to a standard calibration curve
(known AO II concentrations vs OD values).

The amounts of CHX
grafted on the surfaces incubated with different CHX concentrations
(0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) were evaluated by measuring the total reduction
in CHX in the solution at a wavelength of 230 nm. After the reaction,
the solutions in the centrifuge tubes containing the samples were
shaken at 120 rpm for 1 h and then measured by a NanoDrop 2000 UV
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The resulting
data were calculated according to a standard calibration curve (known
CHX concentration vs OD value).

Antibacterial
Test
The capability of the CHX-grafted titanium to present
antibacterial activity was assessed with S. aureus. S. aureus (ATCC 6538) was cultivated
on a solid LB medium agar plate. After static incubation for 24 h
at 37 °C, a colony was picked from the agar plate using a sterile
inoculation loop and added into Luria–Bertani (LB) broth and
then diluted to 107 CFU/mL to obtain a test strain solution.

First, the antibacterial activity of the samples was assessed using
a zone of inhibition (ZOI) test.2 20 μL
of each individual test strain solution was spread evenly onto a solid
LB agar plate surface, and then the samples were lightly placed face
down on the solid LB agar. After static incubation at 37 °C for
1 day, the apparent ZOI around the sample was photographed to assess
the antibacterial activity of the modified surface. Then, 80 μL
aliquots of the test inoculum were distributed onto the surfaces of
different samples in a 24-well plate and gently covered with a piece
of polyethylene film to spread the solution to the edges.42 After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, 1 mL
of LB broth was added to each well and incubated with the samples
in an orbital shaker incubator at 150 rpm and 37 °C for the following
valuation. (1) After incubation for 24 and 48 h, 100 μL of LB
broth was taken out and optical density was measured at 660 nm (OD660) using a microplate reader. (2) After incubation for 24
h, the samples were taken out and gently rinsed with PBS. Then, both
live and dead bacteria on the samples were stained using a LIVE/DEADBacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) to assess the antibacterial properties of the different materials.
Live bacterial cells were stained green, whereas dead cells were stained
red. (3) After incubation for 24 h, each sample was taken out and
gently rinsed with PBS and put into a sterilized centrifuge tube with
200 μL of PBS. After ultrasonic processing for 2 min and vortex
processing for 5 min, 10 μL of the PBS in centrifuge tubes was
collected and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared using sterilized
saline. Then, 100 μL aliquots were spread evenly onto a solid
LB agar plate surface. After incubation for different times, the CFU
on the plates were counted. (4) After incubation for 24 h, the samples
were washed with PBS and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 12
h. After they were dehydrated, dealcoholized, and dried, the fixed
samples were observed via SEM. (5) After 72 h of incubation, the samples
were taken out and washed twice with sterile PBS, and then stained
with 400 μL of a 0.1% (v/v) crystal violet solution for 10 min.
The excess crystal violet was rinsed with PBS. Then, 400 μL
of a 7% acetic acid solution was added and shaken for 10 min. The
absorbance of bacteria biofilms was measured in a 96-well plate at
a wavelength of 595 nm.

Covalent immobilization stably links
a molecule onto the surface for a long time. To evaluate the stability
of the coating, the CHX-modified samples in 2 mL of aseptic PBS solution
were placed in an orbital shaker incubator at 150 rpm and 37 °C,
and then taken out after 3 or 7 days. After being rinsed, dried, and
sterilized with an ultraviolet lamp, the antibacterial properties
of the samples were assessed via live and dead bacteria staining using
the above-mentioned methods.

Cell
Attachment and Proliferation
Mouse (MC3T3-E1) osteoblasts
were cultured in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at
37 °C using α-minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 15% fetal bovine serum. When the cells reached 80–90%
confluence, they were trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended,
and diluted to a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL. Then,
1 mL aliquots of the cell suspension were incubated with the as-sterilized
samples in a 24-well plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The
samples were removed, moderately washed, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
after 1 and 3 days of incubation. Then, the samples were washed with
PBS and incubated with rhodamine123 (20 μg/mL) for 15 min, after
which they were immediately examined under a fluorescence microscope.43 Cell proliferation was determined by an MTT
assay after 1 and 3 days of cultivation.

Competitive Bacterial-Cell Adhesion
First, 80 μL
of LB broth containing S. aureus (105 CFU) was distributed onto the different sterilized surfaces
and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, the samples were rinsed
with PBS once, and 1 mL aliquots of cell suspension (MC3T3-E1) with
a density of 5 × 104 cells/mL were inoculated onto
the samples. After incubation for 1 and 3 days at 37 °C, the
samples were gently washed with PBS, and then both live and dead bacteria/cells
on the samples were stained using the LIVE/DEADBacLight Bacterial Viability Kit to assess the competitive bacterial-cell
adhesion to the different materials.

Statistics
Water contact angle, AO II, bacteria growth measurements,
and the MTT assays were carried out independently at least three times
using more than four parallel samples. The data are presented as the
mean ± standard deviation and were compared through one-way analysis
of variance using SPSS software to evaluate significant differences.
In the figures, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) are denoted with asterisks (*).
