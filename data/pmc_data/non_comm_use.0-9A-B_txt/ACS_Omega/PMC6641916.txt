In
this study, based on silicone composites with graphene oxide
(GO) as a filler, a novel packaging strategy was proposed to reduce
the interface thermal resistance of surface-mounted ultraviolet light-emitting
diodes (UV-LEDs) and provide a potentially effective way for enhancing
the long-term stability of devices. The 4 wt % GO-based composite
showed an excellent performance in the thermal conductivity, and the
interface thermal resistance was reduced by 34% after embedding the
4 wt % GO-based composite into the air gaps of bonding interfaces
in the UV-LEDs, leading to a reduction of junction temperature by
1.2 °C under the working current of 1000 mA. Meanwhile, a decrease
of thermal stress in bonding interfaces was obtained based on the
finite element analysis. What is more, it was found that the lifetime
of UV-LEDs with the proposed structure could be obviously improved.
It is believed to provide a simple and effective approach for improving
the performance of surface-mounted UV-LEDs.

I Introduction
Compared
with the traditional ultraviolet light sources, ultraviolet
light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have attracted a great deal of interest
from researchers because of their excellent characteristics, such
as instant on/off property, compact structure, safety, and environmental
friendliness,1−4 leading to a wide range of applications based on different wavelengths
such as optical communication, air and water purification, medical
phototherapy, UV curing, and so forth. However, compared with visible
LEDs, the light output power (LOP) and lifetime of UV-LEDs still limit
their applications because of the poor light output efficiency and
low thermal stability caused by high junction temperature.5−7 Therefore, devising a strategy
to improve the thermal management and structural stability is a key
issue for high-power UV-LEDs.

Owing to ultrahigh thermal conductivity,8 high Young’s modulus,9 and fracture
strength,10 graphene is proverbially used
in packaging composite materials to improve the thermal characteristics
of semiconductor devices but still limited by its good electrical
conductivity and inferior dispersity in packaging parent polymer materials.
However, graphene oxide (GO), which is similar to graphene in the
physical structure and properties and is easily synthesized compared
with graphene,11−15 demonstrates bad electrical conductivity because the space lattice of graphene is broken by abundant oxygen-containing functional groups
on the surface including hydroxyl, epoxide, carbonyl, and carboxyl
groups. Moreover, these groups allow GO to be relatively easily dispersed
in the polymer matrix and also promote the chemical cross-linking
between GO and polymer in the presence of active sites.16,17 Therefore, GO as the filler in packaging composite materials provides
a good strategy to improve the thermal property of devices. For example,
Zhao et al.18 fabricated liquid silicone
rubber (LSR) composites filled with 0.3 wt % functionalized GO; the
research result revealed a double increase in the thermal conductivity
compared with that of pure LSR. Shahil,19 Kim,20 Yu,21 Song,22 and Zhang23 fabricated a highly efficient thermal interface material
using graphene nanocomposites and adopted it to improve the thermal
performance of LED package. Lee et al.24,25 used graphene/GO-based
composites as a high transmittance lens and bonding material for LEDs,
and the illuminance and stability of LED devices were proven to be
improved.

In this paper, we proposed a new packaging strategy
to reduce the
heat accumulation in the bonding layer and enhance the thermal stability
of high-power UV-LEDs using silicone composites with GO as a filler
to embed the air gaps of the bonding interface. The proposed structure
shows lower interface thermal resistance than the traditional structure,
and the underlying analysis used is finite element analysis (FEA)
to achieve the thermal simulation of temperature field and stress
field. On the basis of the low thermal resistance and junction temperature,
the proposed structure is believed to improve the long-term stability
of UV-LEDs especially under the high-power condition.

II Principle
Owing to the simple structure, mature process,
and high packaging
density,26,27 the surface-mounted structure is widely
used in visible LEDs and UV-LEDs such as the surface-mounted products
fabricated by CREE, OSRAM, NICHIA, SETi, LG, DOWA, and so on. However,
as shown in Figures 1 and 2, in the structure of a surface-mounted
UV-LED bead, the insulating layers must be designed and fabricated
to insert between the layers of the anode, cathode, and thermal pad,
inevitably leading to forming air gaps in the interfaces, which greatly
hinder the heat conduction and make the structure unreliable. On the
basis of the geometric dimensioning of the air gap as shown, the volume
ratio of the air gaps in the bracket-bonding layer is calculated at
about 12.5%, and it is believed that the interface thermal resistance
will decrease if the air gaps are embedded by the composite with high
thermal properties. Hence, a new packaging strategy is proposed to
reduce the interface thermal resistance and to enhance the stability
of high-power UV-LEDs.

substrate.
The cross-sectional image is shown in the inset.

Figure 2 Schematics of the (a) packaging process of UV-LED bead, (b) traditional
structure, and (c) proposed structure.

According to the heat transfer theory,28−33 the proposed structure possesses better thermal conductivity than
the traditional structure, as shown in Figure 2b,c, because the air gaps in parallel with
the heat flow are embedded by the GO-based composite with good thermal
property and become extra thermal conductive paths.34,35 The accumulated heat in the interface can be easily transferred
to the heat sink. To theoretically analyze the thermal resistance
model of the proposed structure, it is simply schematized in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic of the thermal
resistance model of the proposed structure.

Therefore, taking the bracket-bonding layer as an example,
the
following equation is established 1  where Rth-B represents the thermal resistance
of the bracket-bonding interface
in the proposed structure, Rth-solder is the thermal resistance of the solder, and Rth-composite is the thermal resistance of the GO-based
composite. After calculating, the bracket-bonding interface thermal
resistance of the proposed structure is given as 2  

The bracket-bonding interface thermal
resistance of the traditional
structure is that of the SAC305 solder, and it is shown as 3  

Therefore,
the interface thermal resistance of the proposed structure
is smaller than that of the traditional structure. In addition, it
is the same situation in the die-bonding interface. Therefore, the
heat-dissipation ability will be improved by the embedding packaging
structure.

III Results and Discussion
Figure 4a shows the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of GO obtained by the ball-milling method,
which shows that the size of GO is about 1 μm. Figure 4b shows the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of the GO-based composite filled in the air
gap, confirming that GO is randomly dispersed in the composite and
wrapped efficiently in silicone, without any air gap between GO and
silicone. Meanwhile, the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) image
(inset in Figure 4b)
shows the ratio of C and O elements to confirm the existence of GO.
The thermal conductivity of the 4 wt % GO-based composite was evaluated
about 6.1 W/(m·K), and a relative low coefficient of thermal
expansion of 130 × 10–6/K was obtained.

Structure functions, including
cumulative structure functions and
differential structure functions, are obtained by the transient thermal
resistance measurements. Structure functions provide a map of the
cumulative thermal capacitances of the heat flow path with respect
to the thermal resistances from the junction temperature to the ambient
temperature. In the cumulative structure functions, the inflexion
indicated that heat reached new interfaces in the flow path or changed
surface areas in the heat flow path. The thermal resistance is large
in the relatively flat region, whereas the thermal capacitance is
large in the steep region. In addition, the differential structure
functions are defined as the derivative of the cumulative curve. The
local peaks and valleys indicate the middle of any new region, and
their distance along the horizontal axis represents the partial thermal
resistance between these surfaces. The wave crests indicate that the
region has a high thermal conductivity, and the wave troughs indicate
an area with low thermal conductivity.35−38

Sample 1 was fabricated with a low thermal conductivity aluminum
substrate (dielectric coating, ∼2 W/(m·k)). The structure
functions of sample 1 before and after embedding with the GO-based
composite are shown in Figure 5. Accordingly, the distance between the origin and the sixth
peak yields the thermal resistance from the epitaxial layer to the
middle region of the thermal grease. S1 denotes sample 1 before embedding
with the GO-based composite, and S*1 denotes sample 1* after embedding
with the GO-based composite. Therefore, it can be observed that the
junction to substrate thermal resistance (Rth-js) of the proposed structure is reduced from 19.8 to 17.1 K/W after
embedding the GO-based composite under a working current of 500 mA.
Moreover, the junction temperatures of the traditional and proposed
structures were measured at 51.6 and 48.7 °C, respectively, to
indicate that the GO-based composite can improve the thermal dissipation
around structure gaps to benefit the performance of UV-LEDs.

and S*1 denotes sample 1* after embedding with the GO-based composite.
The full line and solid legend represent the differential functions,
and the imaginary line and hollow legend represent the cumulative
functions.

To further understand the insights
of thermal behavior of the GO-based
composite, the simulations for the thermal behavior of the traditional
and proposed structures have been performed using FEA. The material
and structural properties are the same as those in our pervious works,39,40 to help build the simulation model. The ambient temperature was
fixed at 25 °C. Forced convection occurred at the bottom surface
of the aluminum substrate with a stationary temperature of 25 °C,
and other surfaces were cooled by convection with a heat transfer
coefficient of 5 W/(m2·K). It was assumed that the
filled elements formed perfect contacts between the chip and the substrate,
and the air gap of the traditional structure was restricted to a sufficiently
low thermal conductivity [0.026 W/(m·K) referring to air], but
the thermal conductivity of the GO-based composite reached up to 6.1
W/(m·K) according to the test result. The heat flow generated
from the chip is 1.260 and 1.245 W for the traditional and proposed
structures, respectively, which are the experimental result. Because
of the simulated cross-temperature fields shown in Figure 6a, much heat was gathered around
the air gaps and the highest temperature is located at the center
of the chip in the traditional structure. However, the proposed structure
embedded with the GO-based composite possesses extra thermal paths
to decrease the heat accumulation, leading to a decline of maximal
temperature by 2.4 °C, as shown in Figure 6b. On the basis of uniform temperature distribution,
a decrease of thermal stress by 2 × 107 N/m2 was obtained in the proposed structure, as shown in Figure 6d. It is believed that the
microholes caused by high thermal stress will be a humidity path resulting
in possible structure damage;41,42 thus, the proposed
structure has a promising improvement in thermal stability.

images of simulated temperature fields of (a) traditional
structure, (b) proposed structure, and stress fields of (c) traditional
structure and (d) proposed structure.

To further evaluate the effect of the heat dissipation in
the interface
by the proposed structure, sample 2 fabricated with a high thermal
conductivity copper substrate (electrically neutral thermal path,
∼383 W/(m·k)) was investigated. Compared with that of
sample 1, the total thermal resistance of sample 2 is relatively low,
so the thermal resistance of interfaces could be accurately obtained. Figure 7 shows the structure
functions of sample 2 before and after embedding with the GO-based
composite under a working current of 1000 mA. The distance between
the first and the third peaks represents the total thermal resistance
of (1) the partial UV-LED chip, (2) the whole die-bonding interface,
and (3) the partial AlN ceramic bracket. Analogously, the distance
between the third and the fifth peaks represents the total thermal
resistance of (1) the partial AlN ceramic bracket, (2) the whole bracket-bonding
interface, and (3) the partial metal substrate. Accordingly, the thermal
resistance of the die-bonding interface and bracket-bonding interface
could be obtained by analyzing the second peak and fourth peak, respectively.
The thermal resistance of the die-bonding interface of sample 2 is
found to reduce by 0.16 K/W after embedding with the GO-based composite,
revealing a 26.7% thermal resistance decrease in the die-bonding layer.
Similarly, a 34.0% decrease of thermal resistance of the bracket-bonding
interface was obtained after embedding the GO-based composite. Consequently,
the proposed embedding of the GO-based composite structure can efficiently
reduce the interface thermal resistance by about 30%. What is more,
the total thermal resistance of sample 2 is reduced by 1.17 K/W, revealing
a decrease of 21.4% after filling it with the GO-based composite.

Figure 7 Cumulative
and differential structure functions of samples 2 and
2*. S2 denotes sample 2 before embedding with the GO-based composite,
and S*2 denotes sample 2* after embedding with the GO-based composite.

Figure 8 shows the
junction temperature change during cooling of sample 1 and sample
2 after embedding with the GO-based composite. The working currents
of sample 1 and sample 2 are 500 and 1000 mA, respectively. In the
test, the bottom surfaces of the samples are maintained at a constant
temperature of 25 °C by the thermostat chamber of T3Ster. Before
filling sample 1 with the
GO-based composite, the junction temperature of sample 1 is 26.6 °C,
but after filling, the junction temperature reduces to 23.7 °C.
Meanwhile, a decrease of 1.2 °C of sample 2 after filling with
the GO-based composite is also obtained. Furthermore, under the working
current of 1000 mA, the LOPs are 1050 and 1087 mW for sample 2 and
sample 2*, respectively, with an enhancement of 3.5% in the LOP. The
detailed information of LOP is displayed in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). As a result, benefited
from the decrease of interface thermal resistance, the proposed embedding
structure of packaging materials can reduce the junction temperature
and improve the LOP, especially to effectively reduce the junction
temperature of devices with high interface thermal resistance.

The lifetime and thermal stability of UV-LEDs with the proposed
structure were investigated by an accelerated aging test. Four samples
were fabricated for this aging test: sample A and sample B were fabricated
with an aluminum substrate, and sample C and sample D were fabricated
with a copper substrate. Moreover, sample B and sample D were embedded
with 4 wt % GO-based composite. The tests were performed at 25 °C
and 90% relative humidity (RH), and the working currents of four samples
were set at 1000 mA. The LOP was measured over 1000 h to confirm the
long-term stability of the UV-LEDs with the proposed structure. Figure 9 shows the normalized
LOP as a function of the working time. The differences of the light
failure rate are obvious between the traditional structure and the
proposed structure. After 1000 h, the difference in the relative LOP
between the samples C and D was ca. 1.0% and it was up to ca. 2.2%
between the samples A and B. This indicates that the proposed structures
embedded with the GO-based composite (samples B and D) show a lower
light failure rate when compared with the traditional structure (samples
A and C). Therefore, embedding 4 wt % GO-based silicone composite
into the packaging structure could further decrease the interface
thermal resistance and improve the lifetime and thermal reliability
of the UV-LED devices.

shows the accelerated aging process. The tests are performed at 25
°C and 90% RH, and the initial value of LOP is considered to
be 1.

IV Conclusions
In summary, GO was successfully incorporated in the silicone by
the ultrasonic agitation method, which is a simple and efficient approach.
The GO-based composite was applied to the surface-mounted UV-LEDs
as a high thermal conductivity underfilling material. Experimental
results show that the UV-LEDs embedded by the silicone composite with
4 wt % GO filler exhibit superior thermal and reliable performance
by reducing the interface thermal resistance and junction temperature.
The interface thermal resistance of the proposed structure can be
reduced by about 34%. Meanwhile, the increase in junction temperature
can also be decreased by 1.2 °C, leading to a low thermal stress.
It is considered that the proposed structure has greater effect on
the UV-LEDs with high interface thermal resistance. Moreover, the
UV-LEDs with the proposed structure had a low light failure rate compared
to the traditional structure through the accelerated aging test. Accordingly,
the proposed structure embedded with the GO-based composite is believed
to be promising in UV-LED applications with high-power situation.

V Experiments
V.A Materials
The
GO powders (5–50
μm, synthetic), moldable silicone (MS-1002, Dow Corning), UV-LED
chip (wavelength: 395 nm, Flip-Chip), AlN ceramic bracket (ICP Technology
Co. Ltd), SAC305 solder (Senju Metal Industry Co., Ltd), and aluminum/copper
substrates were used for this investigation.

V.B Fabrication
of GO-Based Composites and Packaging
Process
The packaging material of the GO-based composite
was fabricated by ultrasonic agitation which was described in our
previous work.43 As shown in Figure 10, the GO powders
were first dispersed in part A of MS-1002 silicone by sonication and
a planetary gravity mixer (VM300SA2, Sinomix). The air of the mixture
was removed by vacuum, and the GO powders were uniformly dispersed
after centrifugation. Then, part B (a curing agent, A/B weight ratio
of 1:1) is added to the mixture and the GO-based silicone is ensured
to be cured after heating. Finally, the GO-based composite was mixed
again using the planetary gravity mixer. According to previous discussions,
the interface thermal resistance decreases with the increase of the
GO content, but the excess GO will make the composite conductive and
viscous, and it will lead to high risk of a short circuit. Thus, the
silicone composite with 4 wt % GO was fabricated and proven to exhibit
good thermal conductivity, mobility, and insulativity. The UV-LED
chips were bonded onto the AlN ceramic bracket by the AuSn eutectic
method, and then the bracket was mounted onto the metal substrate
through solder reflowing. The bonding process was described in detail
within ref (44). After
that, the GO-based composite was dispensed on one side of the air
gap, and it would fill the whole gap under the action of vacuum and
capillarity, as shown in Figure 10c. In addition, the geometric dimensioning of air gaps
was measured, as seen in the cross section of Figure 10c.

V.C Measurement
TEM, SEM, and EDS measurements were performed
at the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO) at Huazhong
University of Science and Technology. The thermal conductivity was
evaluated by the thermal conductivity measurement apparatus (LW9389,
Longwin, Taiwan). The thermal resistance and junction temperature
of the UV-LEDs were measured using the T3Ster Master System based
on the transient temperature changes during cooling, with the optical
power excluded, as described in JESD51-51 standard.45 Furthermore, the thermal simulations have been performed
based on the FEA.
