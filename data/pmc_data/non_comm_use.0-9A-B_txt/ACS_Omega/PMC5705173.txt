Recently, more studies
have aimed at identifying selective peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) modulators that
transactivate the expression of PPARγ-dependent genes as partial
agonists to improve diabetic symptoms with fewer side effects compared
to classic PPARγ agonists such as thiazolidinediones. We found
that dihydrosanguinarine (DHS) treatment induced preadipocyte differentiation
and lipid droplet accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells, but this effect is
weaker than that elicited by the full PPARγ agonist troglitazone.
Furthermore, this effect was reduced by the addition of a PPARγ
antagonist, indicating the involvement of PPARγ signaling. Our
results suggest that the stimulatory effects of DHS on adipocyte differentiation
and insulin sensitivity are mediated by suppressing adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) alpha, upregulating the expression of PPARγ
and its target genes (particularly Glut-4 and adiponectin) and reducing PPARγ phosphorylation. DHS
significantly enhanced the glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without
observable cytotoxicity at the effective concentration (5 μM)
applied.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
adipocyte differentiation process is tightly controlled by
molecular and cellular mechanisms, including transcriptional factors
and extracellular proteins. Many of the genes associated with the
differentiation and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype could be
involved in metabolic disorders, such as type-2 diabetes and obesity.1 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible
transcription factors and is a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation
and metabolism, controlling the gene networks involved in lipid metabolism
and glucose homeostasis.2,3 PPARγ is the ultimate
effector of adipogenesis in a transcriptional cascade that also involves
members of the C/EBP (CCAAT enhancer binding protein) transcription
factor family.4,5 Together, these proteins regulate
downstream target genes involved in adipogenesis.6 Inhibition of PPARγ activity was reported to exert
antiadipogenic effects, and PPARγ antagonists have been suggested
as candidate drugs for antiobesity.7,8 By contrast,
hyperactivation of PPARγ induced adipose tissue expansion, weight
gain, and fatty livers in human subjects and animals studies as well
as adipogenesis in vitro.2,9 However, activation
of PPARγ also yields beneficial effects—it has been shown
to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.10,11 Full PPARγ agonists such as thiazolidinediones are an effective
class of drugs for treating type-2 diabetes. However, they have serious
side effects such as weight gain, bone loss, fluid retention, and
cardiac risks, which has led to their restricted use in patients.12

Recently, more studies have focused on
finding novel ligands—selective
PPARγ modulators—from synthetic and natural compounds
that exhibit partial agonism based on selective receptor–cofactor
interactions and can target gene regulation. In vivo studies reported
that some PPARγ activators from natural compounds, such as honokiol,
amorfrutin 1, and amorphastilbol, improved metabolic parameters in
diabetic animal models with fewer side effects than full PPARγ
agonists such as thiazolidinediones.13 Many
plant alkaloids were reported to possess potent pharmacological activities
and have been implemented in traditional medicine as well as considered
a model for modern drug synthesis. However, most of these natural
products, especially the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), remain
largely unexplored regarding their partial PPARγ agonistic activity.
Sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid present in the Papaveraceae,
Fumariaceae, and Rutaceae families of plants with reported antimicrobial,
antiinflammatory, and antitumor activities.14−16 The pharmacokinetic
results of sanguinarine in animal studies demonstrated that its in
vivo availability is apparently low and that the main sanguinarine
metabolic pathway is iminium bond reduction, which results in dihydrosanguinarine
(DHS) formation.17 Previously, we found
that BIAs exhibited lipid metabolism-modulating activity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Treatment with berberine
and sanguinarine reduced lipid droplet accumulation in the worms.
This lipid reduction effect was linked to adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) activation.18 AMPK
signaling lies upstream of the PPARγ pathway, and AMPK activation
can inhibit adipocyte differentiation and modulate energy metabolism-related
gene transcription.19,20

Owing to its potential
to differentiate from fibroblasts to adipocytes,
the 3T3-L1 cell line has been extensively used to study adipogenesis
and the biochemistry of adipocytes.21 Here,
we investigated the adipogenic effect of several BIAs (DHS, sanguinarine,
and berberine) in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed increase of the
PPARγ downstream target gene expressions and adipogenesis markers
after DHS treatment. However, its induction of PPARγ was not
as strong as that of the full agonist, troglitazone. Therefore, we
characterized the activity of DHS associated with the PPARγ,
AMPK, and insulin signaling pathways in comparison with troglitazone.
Interestingly, we found that DHS induced adipocyte differentiation,
whereas its oxidized form, sanguinarine, did not. We also investigated
the metabolic fate and the cytotoxicity of DHS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

2 Results and Discussion
In this study, we investigated
the effects of berberine and sanguinarine
on lipid metabolism in mammalian cells. We also examined the activity
of DHS (Figure 1a)
because it is the main metabolite of sanguinarine.17 Preadipocytes (day 0) were incubated in a differentiation
medium in the presence or absence of 5 μM alkaloid for 2 days
and then replaced with a fresh medium containing insulin in the presence
or absence of alkaloid every 2 days until day 8. The adipocytes were
then stained with Oil Red O. Among the treated cells, berberine-treated
cells showed reduced lipid droplet accumulation (Figure 1b), and DHS-treated cells showed
a higher density of lipid droplets, but the sanguinarine-treated cells
showed no significant change compared to untreated cells. Quantitative
measurements of the cellular triglyceride levels also indicated similar
results to those of the lipid droplet staining. Next, we treated preadipocytes
with troglitazone (a known PPARγ agonist that induces adipogenesis).
Both the results of Oil Red O staining and the triglyceride measurement
showed that DHS and troglitazone treatments increased lipid droplet
accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. However, DHS exhibited a weaker effect
than troglitazone at the same concentration (Figure 1c). DHS showed a dose-dependent adipogenic
effect from 2 to 10 μM (Figure 1d), whereas high cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations
higher than 10 μM (see below).

(DHS) and sanguinarine.

at 5 μM [containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)]. n = 9 from three independent experiments. (d) Triglyceride
content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 8 after treatment with various

Student’s t-test.

The conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes involves
the activation
of key transcription factors such as PPARγ and C/EBP. During
the differentiation process, increased C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ
activity induces the transcription of C/EBPα and PPARγ.22 We conducted quantitative RT-PCR to examine
the effect of DHS on the expression profiles of genes involved in
adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells compared with the effects of the same
concentration (5 μM) of berberine and troglitazone as well as
with the nontreated control.

As shown in Figure 2, the expression of many adipogenesis-related
genes was significantly
affected. The two main adipogenic transcription factors—PPARγ
and C/EBPα—were significantly upregulated by troglitazone
and DHS. Some PPARγ target genes, including adipocyte-specific
genes, such as insulin-dependent glucose transporter (Glut4), adipose fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2), cluster
of differentiation 36 (CD36), and adiponectin, were
also upregulated, suggesting that DHS enhances adipocyte differentiation
through the PPARγ signaling pathway. Similar to the observed
increases in lipid droplet accumulation (Figure 1c), DHS exhibited a weaker effect than troglitazone
at a 5 μM dose. By contrast, 5 μM berberine suppressed
the expression of genes involved in PPARγ signaling as shown
by the downregulated PPARγ target genes. These results are consistent
with a report that berberine inhibits adipocyte differentiation through
the PPARγ pathway.23,24

adipogenesis-related pathway genes. 3T3-L1
preadipocytes were treated with 5 μM troglitazone (T), berberine

experiments; error bar = SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.001 vs control;

PPARγ coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A or PGC-1α)
is a
transcriptional coactivator for steroid receptors and nuclear receptors.
It increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and plays
an essential role in metabolic reprogramming in response to dietary
availability by coordinating the expression of a wide array of genes
involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism.25 Antidiabetic drugs such as thiazolidinediones (including
troglitazone and rosiglitazone) increase insulin sensitivity by acting
on the adipose, muscle, and liver to increase glucose utilization
and decrease glucose production. Thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone)
treatment of obese mice boosts PGC-1α transcription in the white
adipose tissue, which is accompanied by increased mitochondrial function
and insulin sensitivity.26 Our qRT-PCR
results showed that the troglitazone treatment upregulated PPARGC1A
expression in 3T3-L1 cells, whereas the effects of berberine and DHS
treatment were marginal.

To investigate whether the effect of
DHS is mediated by PPARγ,
we cotreated preadipocytes with DHS (5 μM) and GW9662 (10 μM),
a PPARγ antagonist. Lipid droplet accumulation and triglyceride
levels were significantly reduced in the presence of GW9662 compared
to DHS alone (Figure 3a). However, simultaneous treatment with DHS and GW9662 did not completely
eliminate the adipogenic effect of DHS on 3T3-L1 cells. This suggests
the possibility of an additional mechanism involved in the adipogenic
effect of DHS.

*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005 compared

error bar = SD. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001; a—compared to control, b—compared to D5
(ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test).

Next, we examined the impact of
GW9662-mediated PPARγ inhibition
on the upregulation of adipogenesis-related genes observed in DHS-treated
cells. The qRT-PCR results showed that cotreatment of DHS with GW9662
suppressed the mRNA levels of the adipogenic factor C/EBPα and the target genes of PPARγ, that is, aP2 and CD36. The transcript levels of PPARγ were reduced in cells treated with addition of GW9662 compared
to when treated with DHS alone (Figure 3b). Furthermore, the immunoblotting results showed
that the PPARγ protein levels were significantly reduced in
cells cotreated with DHS and GW9662, whereas the C/EBPα levels
showed a trend of reduced expression (Figure 3c). These results indicate that the adipogenic
effect of DHS is partially dependent on PPARγ signaling.

Because DHS induced adipogenesis and upregulated PPARγ and
its downstream adipogenic marker gene expressions, we determine its
potential as a ligand for PPARγ using a nuclear receptor cofactor
assay system in comparison to GW1929, a PPARγ agonist which
was supplied with the assay kit as the reference positive control.
The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values
for DHS and GW1929 are approximately 30 μM and 9 nM, respectively
(Figure 4a), whereas
the reported EC50 value for troglitazone is 780 nM.27 This indicates that DHS has poor affinity to
PPARγ. We also carried out a PPARγ transactivation assay
to evaluate the specificity and transactivity of DHS by expressing
a GAL4 DNA-binding domain/PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD)
chimera protein using a pGAL4-PPARγ LBD plasmid and a luciferase
reporter plasmid pUAS-tk-Luc containing the target sequence of GAL4
in HepG2 cells. In our luciferase reporter assay, DHS did not activate
PPARγ in the range of 2–10 μM (Figure 4b). The transactivation assay
was repeated using 3T3-L1 cells. Rosiglitazone and troglitazone showed
PPARγ transactivation with EC50 values approximately
80 and 800 nM, respectively. The reported EC50 values for
these full agonists using the mouse PPARγ receptor were 60–90
and 780 nM, respectively,27 close to our
results (Figure 4c).
However, the DHS treatment showed no transactivation activity relative
to the control (Figures 4c and S1). These results indicate that
the adipogenic effect of DHS is distinct from that of full PPARγ
agonists.

AMPK functions like biological fuel gauge, which is activated
under
conditions that deplete cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and
is phosphorylated on the catalytic α-subunit at Thr172 by the
upstream kinase LKB1. It can also be stimulated by other stimuli that
do not cause a detectable change in the AMP/ATP ratio, including hyperosmotic
stress and drugs such as thiazolidinediones, metformin, and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
ribonucleotide.28 AMPK is activated during
the lipolysis process in adipocytes and has been reported to modulate
the transcription of many genes involved in energy metabolism, including
lipogenesis, triglyceride synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation.29 Studies have reported that the lipid-reducing
effect of natural products acts via AMPK activation. These phytochemicals
include polyphenols such as resveratrol, ginsenoside, and epigallocatechin
gallate as well as plant alkaloids such as berberine and sanguinarine.18,30

AMPKα regulates preadipocyte differentiation by providing
an upstream signal for PPARγ that inhibits adipocyte differentiation.19,20 We investigated the involvement of the AMPK pathway, which lies
upstream of PPARγ and C/EBPα, in the adipogenic effect
of DHS. The immunoblotting results showed that DHS significantly reduced
the AMPKα levels at 5 μM but not at 10 μM (Figure 5a). The effect of
5 μM troglitazone on AMPKα levels was also insignificant
(Figure 5b). Although
the mechanism of how certain plant natural products activate AMPK
signaling while others suppress this signaling pathway is still unknown,
our result implies that the DHS treatment stimulates adipocyte differentiation
via upregulation of PPARγ by inhibiting AMPKα-mediated
signaling.

Studies have found that PPARγ
is also regulated by posttranslational
modification, resulting in insulin sensitization independent of transactivation.
Phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser273 by cyclin-dependent kinase
5 (CDK5) is linked to obesity. Agonists and antagonists of PPARγ
have been shown to exert their insulin-sensitizing effects by blocking
CDK5/ERK phosphorylation. PPARγ agonists with antidiabetic effects
such as thiazolidinediones were found to inhibit CDK5-mediated PPARγ
phosphorylation in the adipose tissue.31 Several PPARγ ligands with weak agonistic activity exhibited
strong antidiabetic effects in vivo. Those ligands were shown to inhibit
CDK5-mediated PPARγ phosphorylation. As such, the ability of
a ligand to suppress PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation was correlated
with its antidiabetic effect but independent of its agonistic activity.32 Therefore, targeted inhibition of PPARγ
Ser273 phosphorylation was suggested for developing new classes of
antidiabetic drugs.

Here, we investigated the effect of DHS
on PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation
in comparison to troglitazone and berberine at day 5. The immunoblotting
results showed that DHS increased PPARγ protein expression of
the treated cells, but the overall PPARγ phosphorylation was
significantly decreased (Figure 6a). The reduction of the PPARγ phosphorylation
level by DHS was more apparent after 24 h treatment than at day 5,
most possibly because of the in vivo metabolism of DHS over time.
At 5 μM, DHS significantly reduced AMPKα and PPARγ
phosphorylation levels. Treatment with 10 μM DHS had no effect
on AMPKα and showed weaker reduction of PPARγ phosphorylation
than with 5 μM DHS (Figures 6b and 5a). These results suggest
that DHS acts via PPARγ- and AMPKα-mediated signaling,
and the effects are dose-dependent. The decrease of PPARγ phosphorylation
suggested the potential of DHS as an antidiabetic agent; therefore,
we next performed a glucose uptake assay to evaluate this effect.

to the protein content of each sample. n = 3 from
three independent experiments; error bar = SD. *p < 0.05 vs control; two-tailed Student’s t-test.

In the adipose tissue, PPARγ
induces the expression of genes
involved in glucose uptake and controls adipocyte-secreted factors
such as adiponectin to affect whole-body insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin
has been shown to play an important role in mediating glucose uptake
in adipocytes and muscle cells. Recent genome-wide scans have mapped
a susceptibility locus for type-2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome
to chromosome 3q27, where the gene-encoding adiponectin is located.33 Decreased adiponectin expression was correlated
with insulin resistance in mouse models of altered insulin sensitivity
and in type-2 diabetes subjects.34

In mammalian cells, facilitative diffusion of glucose across the
plasma membrane is mediated by a family of glucose transporters.35 GLUT4 is a glucose transporter isoform, which
is only expressed in peripheral tissues that are targets for insulin
action, that is, the adipose tissue, cardiac muscle, and skeletal
muscle. When stimulated by insulin, GLUT4 translocates from its intracellular
compartment to the plasma membrane and, therefore, is responsible
for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.36

To evaluate whether DHS enhances glucose uptake, we used an
enzymatic
method to measure 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1
adipocytes. Our results (Figure 6c) showed a significant stimulatory effect of insulin-dependent
glucose uptake by DHS in a dose-dependent manner (5 and 10 μM).
The berberine treatment also significantly increased glucose uptake
in the adipocytes, whereas the troglitazone treatment only showed
a trend of increased glucose uptake. Berberine has been reported to
increase glucose uptake possibly through a mechanism other than PPARγ
activation, as this compound showed antagonistic activity. The expression
and cellular localization of GLUT4 were not altered by berberine;
instead, it was suggested to stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
and preadipocytes by increasing GLUT1 activity.37 These results indicate that the effects of DHS and berberine
on glucose uptake act through distinct mechanisms. Future studies
should elucidate the involvement of GLUT1 and GLUT4 plant alkaloid-mediated
glucose uptake. It is worth noting that while both DHS and troglitazone
treatment strongly upregulated Glut-4 gene expression,
induction of the proadipogenic gene adiponectin by
DHS was less pronounced (Figure 2). This suggests that DHS promotes glucose uptake but
exhibits weaker adipogenicity compared to troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione
for treating type-2 diabetes.

In drug development, findings
from many studies proposed that the
ligand occupancy time on the receptor would improve the potency of
PPARγ modulators by creating an extended period of protection
against kinase activity, that is, longer residence times of a drug
occupying a target result in improved duration of action times for
that drug.38

Here, we investigated
the metabolic fate of DHS and sanguinarine
in 3T3-L1 cells by measuring their accumulation in vivo and in the
culture medium after 48 h using both alkaloids as standards. A total
of 5.7 μmol/g protein of DHS and 0.1 μmol/g protein of
sanguinarine were detected in the DHS-treated cell extract, whereas
2.7 μmol/g protein of DHS and 0.3 μmol/g protein of sanguinarine
were detected in the sanguinarine-treated cell extract. In the cell
culture medium, 0.1 μM each of DHS and sanguinarine were detected
in the DHS-treated sample, whereas 0.1 μM DHS and 0.3 μM
sanguinarine were detected in the sanguinarine-treated sample. This
indicates high accumulation of DHS in both the cell extract samples,
whereas sanguinarine, the oxidized form, was prevalent in the culture
medium (Figure 7a).
This result correlates with those reported in vivo pharmacokinetic
studies that the main sanguinarine metabolism pathway is the reduction
of its iminium bond to form DHS.16 It also
indicates that DHS has higher accumulation in vivo than sanguinarine
and may yield high bioavailability. The cells treated with 10 μM
DHS showed an insignificant reduction of the AMPKα level and
weaker effects on the reduction of the PPARγ phosphorylation
level and on adipogenesis compared to 5 μM DHS. Toxicity was
also observed with the 10 μM treatment on the 3T3-L1 cells.
These findings led us to infer that with 10 μM DHS, the cells
accumulated a higher amount of sanguinarine than the cells with the
5 μM treatment. As described in our previous work,18 sanguinarine exerts an antiadipogenic effect,
activates AMPK, and thus elicits an opposing effect to DHS.

culture medium after 48 h treatment with the respective compound. n = 3 from two independent experiments; error bar = SD.

concentrations. n = 5 from three independent experiments;

The observed different effects
of sanguinarine and DHS on the adipogenesis
of 3T3-L1 cells suggest that the metabolic pathway of a bioactive
compound dictates the ultimate biological effects in vivo. In our
previous study, the sanguinarine treatment activated the AMPK pathway,
which led to the inhibition of lipid synthesis in C.
elegans.18 Although the
mechanism of how sanguinarine activated AMPK signaling is still not
fully elucidated, other studies suggested that this activity was due
to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, which resulted
in an increase of the AMP/ATP ratio. Sanguinarine has also been reported
to activate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.39 We found that the sanguinarine treatment exhibited toxicity
in C. elegans.18

Evaluation of 3T3-L1 cell viability showed that the cytotoxicity
of DHS was insignificant at 5 μM (Figure 7b). This suggests that the cytotoxicity of
a compound could contribute to lipid metabolism because of its effect
on AMPK pathway activation. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate
the effect of bioactive compounds and their metabolites on the multiple
signaling pathways involved in adipogenesis and glucose metabolism
to elucidate their possible mechanisms of action and evaluate their
potential antiobesity and/or antidiabetic effects.

In terms
of differences in the molecular structure, the absence
of a positive charge and the nonplanarity due to lack of conjugation
in DHS was reported to be linked with decreased biological activity
compared to sanguinarine.40 However, those
studies only evaluated the toxicological effect of DHS such as inhibition
of protein kinase C and cytotoxicity in cancer cells, whereby it was
found that sanguinarine was more cytotoxic than DHS. For instance,
in the human leukemia HL-60 cell line, the half-maximal inhibitory
concentration, IC50 values of sanguinarine and DHS were
reported as 0.72 and 20 μM, respectively.41 The in vivo toxicity of sanguinarine was reported as 2.7
mg/kg body weight in mice, whereas no toxic response was found in
rats fed with DHS up to a dose of 58 mg/kg body weight per day.42,43 Our finding that DHS has low cytotoxicity makes this compound a
potential candidate for therapeutic application.

3 Conclusions
This is the first report that evaluated the effect of DHS, a reduced
form of sanguinarine, on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. DHS exhibited
a weaker adipogenic effect than the full PPARγ agonist, troglitazone.
Our results suggest that DHS induced adipocyte differentiation by
upregulating PPARγ and suppressing AMPK signaling pathways.
DHS treatment reduced PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation and upregulated
the expressions of Glut-4 and adiponectin genes—activities that are associated with improved insulin
sensitivity. We found that 5 μM DHS significantly enhanced glucose
uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without exerting cytotoxicity. Further
experiments using animal models are needed to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of DHS for medical application. Although the interaction
of DHS with PPARγ is not fully elucidated, our results show
that DHS bound weakly with PPARγ and did not transactivate it.
Crystallographic structures of the PPARγ ligand binding revealed
two binding modes exist in the same LBD that correspond to potent
and weak agonists and affect their transactivation activities. A weak
agonist could have low transactivation activity but high phosphorylation
inhibition activity on PPARγ Ser273, similar to the characteristics
of DHS discovered in this study.44−46 By examining the metabolic
fates of DHS and its oxidized form, sanguinarine, in 3T3-L1 cells,
we discovered the significance of considering the metabolites of a
compound during bioactivity screening. This is because the metabolic
pathway of a bioactive compound ultimately dictates the biological
effect in vivo. Our findings in this study suggest that BIAs could
be potential lead compounds for modulators of glucose metabolism,
and additional screening of these alkaloids should be carried out
in the future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Berberine sulfate was purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan); troglitazone
and GW9662 from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan);
and sanguinarine chloride and rosiglitazone from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, U.S.A.). DHS was prepared by reducing sanguinarine with
NaBH4 reduction.47 The purity
was analyzed by LC–MS (see below and Figure S2). Alkaloid samples are diluted in DMSO (Wako) to a final
concentration of 0.1% DMSO in cell treatments. All other chemicals
were purchased from Wako, unless otherwise stated.

4.2 Purity Check
The purities of dihydrosanguinarine
and sanguinarine were analyzed by an LCMS2010 system (Shimadzu, Japan)
using a TSK-gel ODS-80Tm 4.6 × 250 mm column. The samples were
analyzed under the following conditions: a column temperature of 40
°C; a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min; and a gradient schedule of 0–15
min of AcCN/H2O = 45:55, 18.5–24.5 min of AcCN/H2O = 80:20, and 28–33 min AcCN/H2O = 45:55
(containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid) in positive SIM-SCAN mode ranging
from m/z 100–500. The purities
were calculated based on % peak area for each sample.

4.3 Cell Culture
3T3-L1 cells (a generous
gift from Dr. M. Nagao, Kyoto University) were cultured at 37 °C,
5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM;
Wako) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Corning). Cells were passaged
twice before used in assays to allow cells to re-establish the normal
cell cycle. Cell differentiation was induced at 2 day postconfluence
(designated as day 0) by addition of the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
(IBMX) mix which consists of 5 μg/mL insulin (Sigma), 500 μM
isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), and 0.25 μM dexamethasone for
2 days.48 The culture medium was replaced
every 2 days thereafter with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 5 μg/mL
insulin.

4.4 Oil Red O Staining
3T3-L1 adipocytes
(day 8 or day 12) in the wells of cell culture plates were rinsed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in formalin for
30 min at room temperature. The formalin was removed, and the cells
were rinsed twice with PBS. A 0.3 w/v % Oil Red O (Sigma) solution
was added at room temperature to stain the cells. After 1 h, cells
were rinsed with PBS twice, and lipid droplet accumulation was observed
under a microscope.

4.5 Triglyceride and Protein
Measurement
3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 12) in the wells of cell
culture plates were
rinsed twice with PBS. Cell lysis buffer (1 M Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 M
MgCl2, 10% Triton X100) was added to each well, and the
cells were harvested using a cell scraper into Eppendorf tubes. The
cells were disrupted using an ultrasonicator. Triglyceride and protein
contents of the cell lysates were measured. The triglyceride concentration
was determined using triglyceride E test kit (Wako) and the absorbance
at 595 nm was measured using a PowerScan4 plate reader (DS Pharma
Biomedical, Japan). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad
DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, U.S.A.) reagents and the absorbance
at 595 nm was measured using the PowerScan4 plate reader. The triglyceride
content of each cell sample was normalized to its corresponding protein
content.

4.6 Quantitative RT-PCR
Two day postconfluent
3T3-L1 cells (day 0) were cultured in the differentiation medium IBMX
without or with the addition of alkaloids for 2 days, followed by
medium change to DMEM/10% FBS/5 μg/mL insulin without or with
the addition of alkaloids. The cells were harvested on day 5 following
the method for protein as described above. RNAs were extracted using
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was done using 2 μg
of total RNA, and RT-PCR was carried out using a CFX96 RT-PCR System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). The conditions
for PCR reactions were 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20
s. Melting curve analysis was performed after each run at 72 −95
°C to check the specificity of amplification. Data analysis was
done using the ΔΔCT method, and a relative transcript
amount was standardized using the TATA box-binding protein as the
internal control. Fold changes between samples were normalized to
control (0.1% DMSO).

4.7 Immunoblot Analysis
3T3-L1 cells
were rinsed twice with PBS. Cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X100,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM Na4P2O7, and 1% protease
inhibitor cocktail) was added to each well, and the cells were harvested
using a cell scraper into Eppendorf tubes. The cells were disrupted
using the ultrasonicator. Protein contents of cell lysate samples
were measured as mentioned above and adjusted to the same amount using
a 2× sample buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 12% β-mercaptoethanol,
20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromophenol blue). The protein (20 μg)
was loaded and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The proteins were electro-transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore Immobilon-P). The membranes were blocked for 1
h at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/Tris buffered
saline with Tween-20 (TBST) and then probed with primary antibody
(in 5% BSA/TBST) overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxide
(HRP)-conjugated secondary donkey antirabbit IgG (in 5% BSA/TBST).
Target-specific antibodies were obtained from the following manufacturers:
AMPKα, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and β-actin from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, U.S.A.); phosphospecific PPARγ
(Ser273) from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Japan); and HRP-conjugated donkey
antirabbit IgG from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, U.K.). Chemiluminescence
was detected using a ChemiDoc Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc., U.S.A.). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with other
primary antibodies and subjected to chemiluminescence detection. The
target protein band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software
(NIH). The average values were normalized to control.

4.8 PPARγ Binding Assay
The ability
of DHS to bind PPARγ was determined using the EnBio receptor
cofactor assay system for PPARγ Kit (EnBio Tec. Laboratories
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
This system employs a cell-free assay using nuclear receptors and
cofactors to screen for chemicals. Changes in the absorbance at 450
nm for reactions treated with DHS, and the PPARγ agonist GW1929
(positive control) were measured using the PowerScan4 plate reader.
The EC50 values were determined from the concentration
that elicited a half-maximal response concentration on the plotted
graphs.

4.9 PPARγ Reporter Assay
The assay
was performed as previously described.49 A DNA fragment encoding the LBD (residues 204–505) of mouse
PPARγ2 (GenBank U09138) with BamHI and SalI sites at the ends was amplified
by PCR using genomic DNA from mouse 3T3-L1 cells as a template and
inserted into the pSG424 plasmid at the BamHI and SalI sites to construct
pGal4-PPARγ LBD. pGal4-PPARγ LBD and pUAS-tk-luc were
cotransfected into HepG2 or 3T3-L1 cells in separate experiments using
HilyMax (Dojindo). The PPARγ agonist activity was determined
via luciferase activity using a Luciferase Assay System according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). The β-galactosidase
activity was determined using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside
(Roche). Relative luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase
activity.

4.10 Glucose Uptake Assay
The assay was
performed according to the reported method50 with modifications. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in six-well
culture plates. Test compounds were added to differentiated adipocytes
on day 8. Insulin stimulation and glucose uptake were conducted on
day 12. Cells were lysed with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and disrupted
using the ultrasonicator. Glucose uptake was determined by 2-deoxyglucose
uptake with an enzymatic photometric assay using 2-deoxyglucose uptake
measurement kit (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Japan). Measurements were done
using the PowerScan4 plate reader at an absorbance of 420 nm in a
kinetic program with a read every 1 min for 30 min. Glucose uptake
values were then normalized to the protein value of the cell lysates
as determined by the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay method described above.
The insulin-induced glucose uptake was calculated by subtracting the
values from the negative control (glucose uptake inhibitor added).

4.11 Alkaloid Accumulation Analysis
3T3-L1
adipocytes (day 4) were treated without or with alkaloids for 48 h
and collected as in protein samples. Cell lysis samples and cell culture
media were extracted with methanol using Sep Pak C18 cartridges (Millipore).
Methanol extracts were concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The
samples were analyzed using an LCMS2020 system (Shimadzu) according
to the previously reported method.23 Alkaloid
concentrations were calculated based on the LC peak area relative
to the standard peak area, and those values are normalized to the
protein content in each sample.

4.12 Cytotoxicity
Assay
The 3T3-L1 cells
were cultured at a density of 1.5 × 103 cells/well
in a 96-well plate for 16 h. The culture medium was then replaced
with a fresh medium with the addition of alkaloids and further cultured
for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo). Cells were incubated with the reagent for 2 h and live
cells were measured using the PowerScan4 plate reader at an absorbance
of 450 nm.
