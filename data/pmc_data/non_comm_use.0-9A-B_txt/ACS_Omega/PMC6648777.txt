Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)
over La1–xMxAlO3−δ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) in an electric
field at low temperature (423 K) was investigated. Among the tested
catalysts, the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst showed the highest performance in terms of C2H6 + C2H4 yield (11.1%). Surface
mobile oxygen species (O22– or O–), which were considered as active oxygen species for
the OCM reaction, increased with increasing Ca doping amount, and
thereby the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst showed the best catalytic activity.

Introduction
Oxidative coupling
of methane (OCM) is a reaction to produce C2 hydrocarbons
from methane and oxygen directly. It has been
attracting lots of attention and has been investigated from the 1980s
because of the need for technical development to convert natural gas
to added value chemicals.1−5 Even though the OCM reaction is exothermic thermodynamically, it
requires a high reaction temperature over 900 K because of high energy
required for dissociation of the C–H bond in methane.6 At such high temperature, C2 hydrocarbons
tend to be oxidized to CO and CO2, resulting in a drastically
decreased C2 selectivity. To prevent the undesirable nonselective
reactions, we conducted the OCM reaction in a low-temperature region
by applying an electric field. Under constant current to the catalyst-bed,
the OCM reaction proceeded at the low reaction temperature of 423
K over Ce2(WO4)3/CeO2 catalyst.7−9

Many researchers have reported that the active oxygen species
on
the catalyst is an active site of the OCM reaction.1,10−13 These oxygen species (e.g., O2–, O–, O22–, and/or O2–) abstract hydrogen atom from methane.6 Perovskite-type oxide materials are known to generate such oxygen
species with high mobility in low-temperature regions relatively.14 Especially, among many kinds of perovskite-type
oxides, LaAlO3 shows high OCM activity.6,10,15,16 By doping
alkali or alkali-earth metal cations, which have strong basic nature,
high C2 selectivity can be obtained.17,18 In addition, substitution of La3+ cation by such cations
resulted in increase of oxygen deficiency in the lattice structure
and this, in turn, contributed to production of O– and O22– type oxygen species.19,20

Herein, we investigated catalytic activity of OCM in the electric
field at the low temperature of 423 K over alkali-earth metal cations
(Ca, Sr, and Ba)-substituted LaAlO3 catalysts. The reaction
mechanism and effects of substituted alkali-earth metal cations on
its structure, electronic state, and OCM activity were also investigated.

Results
and Discussion
First, we investigated the catalytic OCM activity
of La0.7M0.3AlO3−δ (M
= Ca, Sr, and Ba)
at 423 K in the electric field, and the results are presented in Figure 1 and Table S1. The results show that La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ, La0.7Sr0.3AlO3−δ, and La0.7Ba0.3AlO3−δ showed OCM activity at the
low temperature of 423 K in the electric field (imposed current 3.0
mA). Among the tested catalysts, La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ showed the highest C2H6 + C2H4 yield and selectivity. It is noteworthy
that the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst showed higher C2H6 + C2H4 yield than that of the previously reported catalysts,7,8 thanks to its redox property (details are discussed in following
section). Moreover, the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst showed stable activity for at least 180 min (Figure S1) without significant structural deformation
and coke formation (Figures S2 and S3).
From these results, La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ was the most suitable catalyst among the La–M–Al–O
perovskite catalysts in the OCM reaction under electric field.

Figure 1 Results of
OCM activity tests over La0.7M0.3AlO3−δ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskite catalysts
at 423 K in an electric field (3 mA).

The effect of electric field on the activity of La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ was investigated by
comparing the activity with or without the electric field. Results
are shown in Figure 2 and Table S2. As shown in Figure 2, with the aid of electric
field, CH4 conversion, O2 conversion, and C2H6 + C2H4 yield for the reaction
in the electric field were extremely high at low temperature, whereas
no OCM activity was found without the electric field. On the other
hand, in the reaction without the electric field, C2H6 + C2H4 yield steeply increased with
temperature above 800 K. It is well known that perovskite oxide releases
its lattice oxygen at high temperature (i.e., above 800 K for La0.7Sr0.3AlO3−δ), and it
contributed to hydrocarbon conversion by the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.21−24 The isotopic oxygen exchange tests revealed that the lattice oxygen
was exchanged by gas phase molecular oxygen at 473 K with the electric
field and at above 800 K without the electric field (see the Supporting Information, Figures S4 and S5). The
temperature of the catalyst was measured by a thermocouple, and the
effect of Joule heat by the electric field on the catalytic activity
was negligible. From these results, it is considered that applying
electric field to La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ promotes the release of its lattice oxygen even at low temperature
below 700 K, and thereby the OCM reaction takes place.

Figure 2 Temperature dependencies
of OCM activity with or without electric
field over the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst.

In addition, as shown
in Table S1, field
intensity of the applied electric field was ca. 150 V mm–1, which is much lower than that of a plasma-catalyst hybrid system.25 Moreover, the present electrocatalytic system
can proceed the OCM reaction at lower temperature (<700 K) than
that of a high-temperature electrochemical reaction using a SOFC (solid
oxide fuel cell) system (>873 K),14,26 although the
field intensity was higher than that of the SOFC system (<30 V
mm–1). Therefore, the present reaction system, catalytic
reaction in an electric field, is a mild and efficient low-temperature
electrocatalytic OCM.

To clarify effects of Ca doping amount
in LaAlO3 on
its structure and OCM activity, La1–xCaxAlO3−δ catalysts with various Ca doping amount (x = 0,
0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) were prepared and evaluated. Details of the structural
characterizations are described in the Supporting Information (Figures S6, S7, and Table S3). Figure 3 and Table S4 show results of activity tests over La1–xCaxAlO3−δ catalysts in the electric field. O2 partial pressure
decreased from 15% to 5% for comparison of these activities and selectivity
precisely. In the case of LaAlO3 catalyst, spark discharge
was observed due to its low electron, hole, and/or ion conductivity,27 and no products were formed. As the Ca doping
amount increased, CH4 and O2 conversions and
C2H6 + C2H4 yield increased.
Reportedly, the amount of lattice oxygen defect increases by substituting
cations with different oxidation numbers in perovskite structures,
which promotes redox reaction using lattice oxygen through the Mars
van Krevelen mechanism.21−24 In the present catalytic system, the lattice oxygen
contributes to methane activation and C2 product formation.
Therefore, it is considered that Ca doping to LaAlO3 contributed
to increase the amount of lattice oxygen defects, and thereby the
conversions and C2H6 + C2H4 yield increased as Ca doping amount increased.

Figure 3 Effects of the amount
of Ca doping (x) in La1–xCaxAlO3−δ on conversions and C2H6 + C2H4 yield.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were conducted
to investigate the difference in electronic states of lattice or surface
oxygen over La1–xCaxAlO3−δ catalysts. Figure S8 shows O 1s spectra of La1–xCaxAlO3−δ catalysts. Each O 1s spectrum could be deconvoluted to three peaks:
the peaks at around 529, 531, and 532–534 eV were assignable
to Olat (lattice oxygen; O2–), Os (surface or mobile oxygen; O22– and O–), and H2O(ad) (adsorbed
H2O), respectively.10,16,28−30 The mobile oxygen (Os) ratio was calculated
by the following eq 1. 1  

Tables 1 and S5 present
the result of O 1s XPS measurements.
From Table 1, the Os ratio increases by increasing the amount of Ca doping. Therefore,
we deduced the relationship between C2H6 + C2H4 yield and Os ratio as shown in Figure 4. A linear correlation
was found between the Os ratio and C2H6 + C2H4 yield (and CH4 conversion),
suggesting that the Os ratio over La1–xCaxAlO3−δ catalyst plays an important role in the OCM reaction. It was reported
that electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O–), which
was formed by reaction of O2 molecule with metal cations
or oxygen vacancies over the surface of metal oxide catalysts,4,31,32 contribute homolytic C–H
bond dissociation to form methyl radicals.33−36 Also, it was reported that Os species (O– and O22–) participate in the redox reaction.21,28 From the obtained
results and literature, it is considered that Os on La1–xCaxAlO3−δ is the active oxygen species that participates
in the OCM reaction as a redox active site via the Mars van Krevelen
mechanism. Therefore, the OCM activity improved by Ca doping thanks
to increase in the Os ratio as increasing the substituting
amount of Ca.

To elucidate the reaction pathway
on the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst in the electric
field, the effect of contact time (W/FCH4) was
investigated. O2 partial pressure was set to 5% to evaluate
the product selectivity at the initial stage. Figure 5 and Table S6 present
the influence of W/FCH4 on CH4 conversion,
O2 conversion, and selectivity of each product. As shown
in Figure 5a, CH4 conversion and O2 conversion increase as the contact
time increases. As shown in Figure 5b, C2H6 selectivity decreased
gradually as the W/FCH4 increased, and C2H4 selectivity was almost constant in low W/FCH4 region, and it decreased with further increase
in W/FCH4. On the other hand, C2H2 selectivity was almost zero under these conditions, suggesting
that C2H2 was hardly produced by successive
dehydrogenation of C2H4. CO and CO2 were formed even at low W/FCH4, and CO selectivity
increased as the contact time increased, which implies that CO and
CO2 were produced from methane directly (parallel reaction)
in low W/FCH4 region and by oxidation of C2 products (successive reaction) in high W/FCH4 region. From these results, the main reaction pathway is suggested
as follows: C2H6 was formed by OCM reaction
over the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst at first, and then C2H4 was produced
by oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6, and finally
they were oxidized to CO and CO2.

Figure 5 Effect of W/FCH4 on activity and selectivity
of La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst:
(a) conversions and C2H6 + C2H4 selectivity, (b) product selectivities.

In order to investigate the reactivity of C2 products,
the reactant was changed from CH4 to C2H6 or C2H4. The results of each catalytic
activity test are shown in Table S7. In
each case, C2 hydrocarbons, CH4, CO, and CO2 were produced; however C3+ hydrocarbons were not
detected. From Table S6, C2H6 conversion was lower than CH4 conversion, and
C2H6 was mainly converted to C2H4 by oxidative dehydrogenation. Similar to the CH4 reaction, C2H2 selectivity in C2H6 or C2H4 reaction was also very
low. Although main products from C2H4 were CO
and CO2, C2H4 conversion was low
despite the presence of unreacted O2. Considering the obtained
results, the C–H bond of C2H6 was selectively dissociated rather than C–C bond dissociation. Also, both
dehydrogenation and oxidation of C2H4 hardly
proceeded in the present system. Scheme 1 shows a possible reaction pathway. Therefore,
the high C2H6 + C2H4 yield
was obtained over the La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst with the electric field.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, OCM has been conducted over various perovskite oxide
catalysts in the electric field at low temperature. Applying the electric
field facilitated the OCM reaction under low reaction temperature
(423 K). The La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ catalyst showed the highest C2H6 + C2H4 yield (11.1%) than ever. Surface mobile oxygen species
(Os: O22– or O–) on La1–xCaxAlO3−δ was considered as active oxygen
species for the OCM reaction via the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.
The Os ratio increased with increasing the amount of Ca
doping, and thereby the OCM activity improved. In this catalytic system,
oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 easily proceeds,
whereas successive C2H4 conversion hardly does,
resulting in high C2H6 + C2H4 yield. La0.7Ca0.3AlO3−δ generated effective oxygen species in the electric field, which
brought high C2H6 + C2H4 yield at low reaction temperature of 423 K.

Experimental Section
Catalyst
Preparation
Perovskite oxide catalysts (La1–xMxAlO3−δ; M = Ca, Sr, Ba; x = 0, 0.1,
0.2, 0.3) were prepared by a citric acid complex method according
to the reported procedure.21,22,27 First, metal nitrate precursors were dissolved with distilled water
in a Teflon beaker and stirred. Next, ethylene glycol and citric acid
were added to this solution. The molar ratio of metal/citric acid/ethylene
glycol was 1:3:3. This solution was heated to 353 K for 15 h, and
the gel was heated and stirred to dry up the water completely. Precalcination
was conducted at 673 K for 2 h. Thereafter, the obtained powder was
calcined at 1123 K for 10 h.

Activity Tests
Catalytic activity
tests were conducted
in a fixed-bed flow type reactor with a quartz tube (6 mm o.d., 4
mm i.d.).37Figure S9 shows schematic diagram of the reactor. The catalysts were
sieved to 355–500 μm, and 100 mg of it was inserted into
the reactor. To impose electric field to the catalyst, two stainless-steel
electrodes were inserted to the upper-side and the bottom-side of
the catalyst-bed. The constant current of 3.0 mA was imposed to the
catalyst bed using a dc power supply. The reactant feed gases were
methane, oxygen, and argon in the ratio of CH4/O2/Ar = 25:15:60 (total flow rate 100 SCCM) for catalyst screening
test and stability test and CH4/O2/Ar = 25:5:70
(total flow rate 100 SCCM) for investigating the effects of W/FCH4 and Ca-doping amounts. For determining the reactivity
of ethane and ethylene, C2H6 and C2H4 were fed into the reactor instead of methane. The ratio
of the feed gas was C2H6 or C2H4/O2/Ar = 25:15:60 (total flow rate 100 SCCM). The
product gases were analyzed with a GC-FID (GC-2014s; Shimadzu Corp.)
with Porapak N packed column and a handmade methanizer (Ru/Al2O3) and a GC-TCD (GC-2014s; Shimadzu Corp.) with
molecular sieve 5A packed column. CH4 conversion, O2 conversion, C2 selectivity, C2 yield,
C2H6 conversion, and C2H4 conversion were calculated by the following formulas. The carbon
balance was almost 100%. 2   3   4   5   6   7  

Characterization
The catalyst structure
was characterized
by powder X-ray diffraction (SmartLab III; Rigaku Corp.) at 40 kV
and 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation and Raman spectroscopy (NRS-4500;
Jasco Corp.) with green laser (λ = 538 nm). Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) observations were performed using field emission-transmission
electron microscope (JEM2100-F; JEOL Ltd.) operated at 200 kV. The
specific surface area of each catalyst was measured by N2 physisorption at 77 K with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method (GeminiVII; Micromeritics Instrument Corp.) after pretreatment
at 573 K for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere (Table S8). XPS (VersaProbe2; ULVAC-PHI Inc.) measurements were conducted
with an Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energies were referenced
to C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The 16O2/18O2 isotopic oxygen exchange tests in the temperature-programmed
reaction or isothermal transient reaction were conducted using the
fixed-bed continuous flow-type reactor equipped with a quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QGA; Hiden Analytical Ltd.). Details are described
in the Supporting Information.
