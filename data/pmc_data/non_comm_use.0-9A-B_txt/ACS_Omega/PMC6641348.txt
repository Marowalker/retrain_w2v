N-unsubstituted thienoisoindigo (TII) is developed with more than
25% overall yield, which is higher than the reported cases, and allows
facile side-chain manipulation of the thienoisoindigo core.

Introduction
Isoindigo,
a well-known isomer of indigo, has found widespread
use as an acceptor building block in organic electronics, particularly
in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics
(OPVs), owing to its low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
energy level.1−4 The synthesis of N-unsubstituted isoindigo is quite straightforward
and high yielding, allowing further manipulation on the nitrogen atom
of the lactam moiety for side-chain engineering. Pei and co-workers
synthesized N-alkylated isoindigo with different branch point positions,
which could finely tune the packing patterns of the corresponding
polymers and hence their OFET performance.5 Bao et al. managed to introduce a siloxane side chain onto isoindigo,
which led to a closer π–π stacking of the polymers
and better hole mobility.6,7 They also synthesized
isoindigo with polystyrene side chains, which greatly increased the
solubility of the polymers and improved the power conversion efficiency
and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of
the corresponding solar cells.8,9 A phosphonate side chain
was also introduced onto isoindigo, which improved the short-circuit
current (JSC) of the corresponding polymeric
OPVs.10 It has been proven that side-chain
engineering of isoindigo is a powerful protocol to adjust the interaction
of the corresponding polymeric chains and therefore the related electronic
properties.

Thienoisoindigo (TII), in which the benzene rings
of isoindigo
are replaced with thiophene rings, is a very important derivative
of isoindigo, and its synthesis was first reported by Ashraf et al.11 TII introduces possible S···S
interactions and exhibits better coplanarity and smaller steric hindrance
with adjacent aromatics when incorporated into polymer chains. Polymers
based on TII showed excellent charge carrier mobilities,12,13 ultra-narrow bandgaps with near-IR response,14,15 and decent OPV performance.16,17 We anticipated that
if side-chain engineering protocols could be applied to TII, the properties
of the related polymers could be further improved. However, the synthetic
route toward TII-based molecules is quite limited. For a long period
of time, only N-alkylated TII could be synthesized (Scheme 1, route 1).11 The synthesis of TII began with the amination of 3-bromothiophene
with alkylated amine, which was generally prepared from the corresponding
alkyl bromide in several steps. Then, the secondary amine reacted
with oxalyl chloride, resulting in the formation of thieno-isatin.
Once the isatin analogue was obtained, the N-alkylated TII could be
obtained either by the treatment of the Lawesson reagent or P(NEt2)3, or by the condensation reaction. The yield
in each step in route 1 was practically low (less than 50%), and alkylamines
was much more expensive than alkyl bromides. Furthermore, the installation
of an alkyl group in the early stage might prohibit the further manipulation
of the side chain, which is a disadvantage in terms of adjusting the
properties of TII-based polymers. It was not until very recently that
Yoo et al. reported the synthesis of N-unsubstituted TII (Scheme 1, route 2).18 Thiophene-3-carboxylic acid was first converted
to t-butyoxocarbonyl (Boc)-protected 3-aminothiophene,
which was then treated with oxalyl chloride to give the Boc-protected
thieno-isatin in moderate yield. Dimerization of the Boc-protected
thieno-isatin gave Boc-protected TII, which was in turn converted
to N-unsubstituted TII by removing the Boc group under acidic conditions.
However, this route is not atomic efficient because tedious protection/deprotection
steps are needed. In this short article, we wish to report a simple
and efficient route toward the synthesis of N-unsubstituted TII.

Scheme 1 Reported Synthetic Route to N-substituted and N-unsubstituted TIIs
Results and Discussions
Starting from 3-aminothiophene, we screened many conditions to
pursue the precursor suitable for cyclization to give N-unsubstituted
thieno-isatin. However, the treatment of 3-aminothiophene with conventional
reagents that are suitable for the synthesis of isatin, such as oxalyl
chloride and trichloroacetic chloride, under various conditions failed
to afford the desired product, which may be attributed to the highly
reactive electron-rich thiophene. Fortunately, we finally found that
by treating compound 1 with 2-chloro-2-oxoethane-1,1-diyl
diacetate with the sequential addition of hydroxylamine using Rewcastle’s
method, the corresponding oxime, 2, could be obtained
in decent yield,19 as shown in Scheme 2. This is the key
step toward thieno-isatin synthesis. Compound 2 underwent
cyclization easily using H2SO4 as the catalyst
to afford N-unsubstituted thieno-isatin 3 in 85% yield.
The direct dimerization of compound 3 in the presence
of the Lawesson reagent gave N-unsubstituted TII (compound 4) in 50% yield. This route avoids the use of protecting groups, and
the overall yield is over 25%, higher than that of route 1 (<10%) and route 2 (21%). The other benefit of this
route is that no column chromatographic separation is required and
hence the reaction could easily be scaled up to tens of grams.

Scheme 2 New Synthetic Route toward N-Unsubstituted TII
The successful preparation of N-unsubstituted
TII allows the introduction
of various side chains, as shown in Table 1. Linear alkyl groups and branched alkyl
groups (entries 1–6) could be installed in a high overall yield,
much higher than the reported cases (if reported).20−22 Benzyl-substituted
TII was also prepared in a 22% overall yield (entry 7). The Boc protecting
group could also be introduced in high yield (entry 8). Importantly,
the unsaturated side chain could be installed in high yield, which
allows for further manipulation of TII with a siloxane side chain
(entry 9).

In conclusion, a highly efficient,
easily scalable synthetic method
toward N-unsubstituted TII was established with more than 25% overall
yield, which makes further side-chain engineering of TII-based polymers
possible. In addition, the functionalization of TII showed a much
higher overall yield than the reported cases (if reported). We are
currently working on the side-chain engineering of TII based polymers,
which will be reported in due course.
