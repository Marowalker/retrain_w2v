B-cell
epitope sequences from Zika virus (ZIKV) NS1 protein have
been identified using epitope prediction tools. Mapping these sequences
onto the NS1 surface reveals two major conformational epitopes and
a single linear one. Despite an overall average sequence identity
of ca. 55% between the NS1 from ZIKV and the four dengue virus (DENV)
serotypes, epitope sequences were found to be highly conserved. Nevertheless,
nonconserved epitope-flanking residues are responsible for a dramatically
divergent electrostatic surface potential on the epitope regions of
ZIKV and DENV2 serotypes. These findings suggest that strategies for
differential diagnostics on the basis of short linear NS1 sequences
are likely to fail due to immunological cross-reactions. Overall,
results provide the molecular basis of differential discrimination
between Zika and DENVs by NS1 monoclonal antibodies.

Introduction
Given the recent outbreak
of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas
in 2015 and the association with microcephaly cases1,2 and
neurological disorders, such as the Guillain–Barré syndrome,
ZIKV was recently placed as a public health emergency of international
concern by the World Health Organization.3 ZIKV is a flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitoes,4 and closely related to dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Japanese
encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus (YFV).5 To date, there is no prophylactic treatment nor vaccine
available against ZIKV and disease control is limited to vector eradication
strategies. The presumptive diagnosis is typically clinical, whereas
confirmatory laboratory tests include classic virus isolation on cell
culture and viral RNA detection by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)
in serum, saliva, and/or urine samples within the first 5 or 6 days
of infection.6,7 ZIKV serology is usually performed
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using full-length viral
proteins or linear peptides, however, due to high cross-reactivity
of IgM and IgG antibodies between ZIKV and other related flavivirus,
especially in endemic areas where cocirculation exists, confirmatory
tests are necessary. Currently, confirmation testing is performed
by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), according to previously
published protocols.8−11 At present, there are only a very few commercially available serology
kits for ZIKV antibody detection; moreover, the specificity of these
kits remains elusive, given the high cross-reactivity already reported
among individuals who experienced consecutive flavivirus infections.12,13 On the basis of this, PRNT remains the “gold standard”
for antiflavivirus differentiation.10 PRNT,
however, is a high-cost technique that requires highly specialized
laboratories and special regulations due to live virus manipulations.
Although new protocols using recombinant viruses14 or reporter virus particles11 have been developed, these are still not available for ZIKV routine
diagnosis.15 In this scenario, there is
an urgent need for a low-cost unequivocal serological diagnostic method
for ZIKV to be able to overcome the high cross-reactivity with other
flaviviruses, such as DENV and yellow fever (especially on vaccinated
individuals).16

The ZIKV positive-sense
RNA genome comprises a single open reading
frame encoding a unique polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural
proteins (Capsid (C), premembrane (prM), and envelope (E), which form
the virus particle, and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A,
NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5), which perform essential functions
in genome replication, polyprotein cleavage, and modulation of cellular
processes to viral advantage.17,18 Among the NS proteins,
NS1 glycoprotein is a multifunctional virulence factor.19,20 Within infected cells, glycosylated NS1 is found as a membrane-associated
dimer after translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, in
which it colocalizes with dsRNA and the viral replication complex,
being essential for viral genome replication.18 Infected cells also secrete NS1 as a hexameric lipoprotein,21 which interacts with complement-system proteins
and has several immune-modulatory functions.18 This conformational dynamism of NS1 is also employed by the virus
during the infection cycle to evade antiviral cellular immune responses
from the host.22 The homodimer structure
of ZIKV NS1 is presented in Figure 1 and encompasses a highly structured continuous extended
β-sheet ladder on one surface. On the opposite face, there is
a predominance of a nonstructured loop medley and a flexible loop,
comprising the residues from 108 to 129.18 The loop surface of flaviviruses NS1 has been previously suggested
to play a role in interactions of this protein with host factors and
antibodies.23

Figure 1 Cartoon representation
of the ZIKV NS1 homodimer structure. Protein
chains are shown in white and gray. Putative epitopes are mapped as
the wireframe surface and color coded as E1 in yellow, E2 in green,
E3 in cyan, E4 in blue, E5 in orange, E6 in red, and E7 in magenta.
The corresponding secondary structure assignment for each putative
epitope is shown at the bottom, with their respective amino acid sequence
(PDB ID 5K6K).

Besides playing a crucial role
in the pathogenesis of the ZIKV
infection, NS1 emerges as a potential candidate for differential diagnostics.16 NS1 is considered the major antigenic marker
for flavivirus infections, and it has been used for the detection
of DENV in patient sera.22,24−30 Despite structural conservation of NS1 among flaviviruses, the average
sequence identity between ZIKV and DENV NS1 proteins is about 55%,16,31 and ZIKV-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been isolated,16 showing that this protein contains regions capable
of being specifically recognized. Additionally, some differences between
the NS1 of ZIKV and other flaviviruses have been reported. A negatively
charged glutamate residue located at position 315 of ZIKV NS1 has
been pointed out as exclusive for ZIKV, being absent in other flaviviruses
including DENV serotypes which have a serine residue at this position.
As a consequence, differences are observed in the electrostatic surface
potential of ZIKV NS1 compared to that of other flaviviruses.31 Another recent work reported the crystal structure
of full-length ZIKV NS1 and revealed a region formed by the residues
108–129 on the wing-domain flexible loop, which had not been
previously described in other flaviviruses.18 Nevertheless, complete mapping of B-cell ZIKV NS1 epitopes have
not been reported. In the present work, we have assigned ZIKV NS1
putative B-cell epitopes and mapped the identified regions onto the
corresponding three-dimensional structure. Comparisons of the identified
B-cell ZIKV NS1 epitopes to their homologous regions in NS1 from DENV2
on the basis of sequence identity analysis and conformation assessment
through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided a solid understanding
of the molecular basis for differential antibody discrimination.

Results
and Discussion
Epitope Prediction
Detection of
antigen and pathogen
specific antibodies is among the most used approaches for clinical
diagnostics. Antigen specific antibody detection is used in the diagnosis
of several diseases, and its application continues to expand. In addition,
antibodies are the most effective mechanism of protection provided
by the adaptive immune system. A critical and at many times limiting
aspect for eliciting highly specific antibodies is the structural
transiency of certain conformational B-cell epitopes. In addition,
important epitopes are often cryptic, frequently buried within the
protein, and only exposed when the virus binds to its receptor.32 Thus, when searching for B-cell epitopes in
a given protein, it is important that they are located in accessible
regions to allow proper recognition and interaction with their respective
antibodies. Therefore, to perform in silico epitope prediction, the
ZIKV NS1 protein structure (PDB ID: 5K6K)18 was used.
Although the ZIKV NS1 structure is presented in a dimeric form, only
the B chain was used in the epitope prediction analyses, as the three-dimensional
coordinates for residues 113–120 have not been experimentally
assigned for the chain A. Most methods of epitope prediction use properties
related to surface exposure, such as flexibility or hydrophobicity.33 In this work, we have chosen three algorithms
to assess the robustness of our epitope prediction rationale. We combined
ElliPro that is based on the geometrical properties of the protein
structure (antigenicity, solvent accessibility, and flexibility) and
can predict linear and conformational epitopes,34 Epitopia that implements a machine-learning algorithm that
was trained to discern antigenic features within a given protein and
predicts the most probable conformational epitope regions,35 and DiscoTope that is based on amino acid statistics,
spatial information, and surface accessibility and can predict residues
that are part of conformational epitopes recognized by B-cells.36 A previous study has pointed out that consensus
results from the three servers would improve the specificity and accuracy
of epitope prediction, resulting in a lower number of false positive
results and thus generating greater confidence.37 Considering consensus overlapping regions by at least two
servers, 7 putative ZIKV NS1 regions have been selected, with epitope
lengths ranging from 10 to 22 residues (Table 1). The identified regions include sequences
that encompass the E315 residue and residues 108–129, which
have been previously described due to the presence of exclusive features
in ZIKV that were not found in other flaviviruses.18,31

Upon comparing the results obtained by each
server, ElliPro predicted
a higher number of B-cell epitopes, followed by Epitopia, whereas
DiscoTope predicted only three putative epitopes (Table 2). The greater performance of
Ellipro may be related to an algorithm that takes into account structural
information as well as the identification of regions in the protein
that protrude from the globular surface. Discotope presented a lower
performance possibly because it uses a sequence-based prediction wherein
individual residues are listed. Therefore, this suggests that at least
for the NS1 protein of ZIKV, sequence information alone may lead to
a poor prediction performance. The selected regions were mapped onto
the ZIKV NS1 structure along with their corresponding secondary structure
content, as shown in Figure 1. Among the seven identified putative epitopes, the structural
mapping (Figure 1)
suggests that those regions comprise two conformational epitopes (CE1
and CE2) and one linear epitope (LE1). CE1 consists of E1, E2, and
E3 identified regions; CE2 consists of E5, E6, and E7 identified regions;
whereas LE1 corresponds to the E4 region. The same epitope prediction
scheme was carried out for the NS1 protein from DENV2 (PDB ID 4O6B(38)), as it is the only serotype structure available in the
PDB. All three algorithms predicted the seven corresponding regions
in the same manner as putative epitopes (data not shown for conciseness).
This is not unexpected given that the two proteins share a nearly
identical three-dimensional structure.

ZIKV Peptide
Microarray
To assess the reactivity of
the identified ZIKV NS1 epitopes with specific IgG antibodies, a 15-mer
peptide library spanning the entire ZIKV NS1 protein was tested against
seven confirmed convalescent ZIKV positive patients and 6 ZIKV and
DENV naïve human serum samples (control) in a peptide microarray.
The ZIKV NS1 peptides were tested against each individual sample. Figure 2A shows the schematic
representation of the assay, whereas Figure 2B shows the fluorescence readings for the
putative epitopes. Values are presented as an average of individual
measurements for each serum along with the corresponding standard
error of the mean (SEM). SEM is a statistical method that takes into
account the sample size and standard deviation to provide accuracy
of the mean. (Given the small sample size (7 ZIKV positives and 6
controls), results from most statistical analyses, such as t-test, cannot be applicable with confidence). Accession
numbers for the sequences used in the peptide microarray are listed
in Table S1.

NS1 epitopes. (A) The experimental detection scheme of the ZIKV NS1
15-mer peptide array. (B) AntiZIKV NS1 IgG detection for each ZIKV

The results of the ZIKV peptide microarray technique show
that
all of the seven in silico predicted regions were recognized by IgG
antibodies present in human serum samples from ZIKV-infected individuals.
Although larger differences between positive and negative serum samples
are observed for E1–E4, discrimination was possible for all
cases. Inference about the amplitude of the differences cannot be
made due to a small sample size and the fact that (intrinsically flexible)
peptides are used as markers for antibody recognition and therefore
may only be present in a recognizable conformation, part of the time.
Nevertheless, these results confirm the immunogenicity of the identified
regions and thus validate the computational prediction approach. (It
is worth mentioning that for the limitations stated above, it is out
of the scope of this work to draw conclusions regarding ZIKV immune
response to these epitopes; this assay was used with the sole purpose
of validating the computational predictions).

Sequence Identity Analysis
The identification of B-cell
epitopes containing low sequence identity between ZIKV and DENV1–4
is of particular interest for the development of differential diagnostic
tools between the two infections. Conversely, epitopes exhibiting
high sequence identities between the two viruses and capable of eliciting
cross-neutralization can potentially be used in multivalent vaccine
formulation strategies. Alignment of the identified ZIKV NS1 putative
epitopes with DENV NS1 revealed a considerably high identity with
at least one strain (Figure 3). Therefore, all seven peptide sequences are unlikely to
be successful for differential diagnosis between ZIKV and DENV patients.
Interestingly, those seven regions comprise 31% of the entire NS1
protein and by excluding them from the alignment, the overall identity
falls to ca. 16% (from ca. 55 to 39%, Figure 3). We consider sequence-bias prediction unlikely
because the sequences of the seven epitopes are very different from
each other. The evolutionary implications of having conserved B-cell
epitopes between the two viruses are unknown. It suggests that these
epitopes might be involved in important infection mechanisms because
in principle, a lower identity would aid ZIKV to evade immune response
from patients previously infected by DENV.

between ZIKV and DENV1–4 NS1
proteins. (Standard deviation bars are presented for the 10 most prevalent
DENV strains. NS1-epitope sequences correspond to the entire NS1 sequence
excluding the seven in silico predicted putative epitope regions).
A dotted line represents the average identity between the full-length
NS1 of the Brazilian strain with the 10 most prevalent strains of
DENV1–4.

Nevertheless, it has
been reported that antiZIKV NS1 mAbs were
able to be virus type-specific, not showing cross-reactivity with
DENV NS1.16 We have observed that individual
linear sequences are conserved and clustered together in two regions,
possibly forming two conformational epitopes. The high identities
of the linear sequences of the epitopes of ZIKV are likely to cross-react
with antibodies antiDENV and suggest that such differential antibody
recognition takes place via conformational epitopes. Although one
cannot overrule an eventual nonpredicted epitope on NS1 from ZIKV
and DENV, we consider it unlikely given that the three algorithms
used predicted epitopes on the same regions of the two proteins. Therefore,
we postulate that such discrimination at the molecular-level is likely
explained by either a contrasting tertiary arrangement of those regions
on the protein surface and/or a distinct charge signature profile.

Epitopes’ Conformational
Arrangement and Electrostatic Surface Profiles
To gain insights
into the dynamics and conformational profiles of ZIKV and DENV NS1
proteins, MD simulations were performed using the dimeric form of
the protein from both viruses. The DENV serotype 2 was chosen as the
representative of DENV strains, as it is the only dimeric structure
currently available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). On the basis of
the MD results, no significant differences could be observed by comparing
the global structural protein dynamics (Figure S1). The root-mean-square deviation, radius of gyration (Rg), and root-mean-square fluctuation for both
systems showed equivalent behaviors for the NS1 dimers and each monomeric
unit within the dimer. These findings are in agreement with the work
by Brown et al.18 and Song et al.,31 showing that in its protein fold and domain
arrangement, ZIKV NS1 is virtually identical to DENV2 NS1. Still,
a small per-residue solvent accessibility (Figure S2) and fluctuational (Figure S1) differences may be observed in some of the seven predicted epitope
regions, when comparing ZIKV and DENV2 NS1. However, differences in
solvation on the epitope regions are subtle (Figure S3) and do not warrant a differential tertiary arrangement
of such epitopes onto ZIKV and DENV2 NS1 surfaces.

Because the
putative epitopes were shown to be conserved but not the remaining
residues, the electrostatic surface potentials were calculated and
plotted onto the molecular surface of representative frames of ZIKV
and DENV2 NS1 extracted from the MD simulations (Figure 4). A significant divergence
between ZIKV and DENV2 NS1 can be observed. Despite approximately
55% of sequence identity between the proteins, ZIKV NS1 shows a remarkably
negatively charged profile, whereas DENV2 presents extensively positively
charged regions, especially in the loop region. Accordingly, the same
charge-distribution pattern was described by Brown et al. when evaluating
the electrostatic surface potential of entire NS1 proteins from ZIKV
and DENV.18 Because the outer face of NS1
is more likely to elicit an immune response, regardless of NS1 being
on the cell surface or being secreted, this difference in electrostatic
distribution between ZIKV and DENV has implications for immune system
recognition and vaccine development and points toward different modes
of flavivirus pathogenesis.

potential on
both faces of glycosylated ZIKV and DENV2 NS1 proteins. The locations
of the predicted epitopes are color-contoured (green: CE1, yellow:
CE2, and black: LE1). Negatively charged regions are shown in red,
positively charged regions in blue, and neutral regions in white.
(Plotted potential ranged from −2 to +2 kJ mol–1 e–1.)

Most of these regions, however, occur away from the predicted
epitopes
(Figure 4) and shall
be involved in other processes beyond antibody recognition. In addition,
significant differences in the electrostatic potentials are also observed
for the predicted epitopes (Figure 4). CE1 contains a higher amount of positively charged
surface in the β-ladder view in DENV2 and significantly different
conformational arrangements in the two proteins in the loop surface
due to the Asn130-linked glycan orientation. For CE2, although the
spatial distribution is quite similar in both surface views, the charge
distribution differs between ZIKV and DENV2. LE1 also shows significant
differences both in terms of conformation and electrostatic potential,
being more exposed in the loop surfaces of both proteins but containing
a considerably more positively charged surface in DENV2. Altogether,
CE1 appears to have
most conformational and charge-distribution differences between ZIKV
and DENV2 (Figure 4) while being highly solvent-exposed in both (Figure S2), especially in the region between residues 108
and129 (Figure S3).

Conclusions
Putative ZIKV NS1 B-cell epitopes were mapped onto the NS1 protein
surface. Our results revealed that: (i) ZIKV NS1 immunogenic regions
are comprised by two conformational epitopes and a linear one; (ii)
epitope sequences were found to be conserved between ZIKV and DENV;
(iii) despite the high epitope identity and structural similarity,
ZIKV and DENV2 NS1 proteins display a loop–surface interface
with significantly different electrostatic potentials; (iv) these
differences are suggested to explain the molecular basis for unique
binding properties to host factors and specific protective monoclonal
antibody recognition therefore providing a lead for rational epitope-focused
design of diagnostic tools and structure-based vaccine antigens for
ZIKV infection.

Materials and Methods
Epitope Prediction
Atomic coordinates for the Brazilian
ZIKV NS1 strain obtained experimentally (PDB ID: 5K6K(18)) were used in three different structure-based tools for
epitope prediction: ElliPro,34 Epitopia,35 and DiscoTope.36 Additionally,
the solvent-accessible surface area was calculated using the postprocessing
tool g_sas within GROMACS 5.1.2 package,39 to evaluate the exposure of each putative epitope to the solvent.

NS1 ZIKV Peptide Microarray
The publicly-available
whole proteome sequences of 15 ZIKV strains (see accession numbers
on Table S1) were retrieved from the NCBI
database and translated into 15-mer peptides with a peptide-peptide
overlap of 12 amino acids. The whole proteome array data will be published
elsewhere. Peptide arrays were produced by the company PEPperPRINT
GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany) in a laser printing process on glass slides,
coated with a poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate/poly(methyl methacrylate)
graft copolymer, which were functionalized with a ßAla-ßAla-linker.
In brief, a layer of amino acid particles containing Fmoc-amino acid
pentafluorophenyl esters was printed layer after layer onto the functionalized
glass slides, with intermittent melting (i.e., coupling) steps at
90 °C and chemical washing and capping steps.40 Peptides were generated in duplicates on the arrays, which
were screened for IgG responses in human sera.

Immunostaining of Peptide
Microarrays
Peptide microarrays
were placed in incubation trays (PEPperPRINT GmbH; Heidelberg, Germany)
and blocked for 30 min at room temperature at 120 rpm orbital shaking,
with western blot blocking buffer MB-070 (Rockland). Then, sera were
diluted by 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer with 0.05%
Tween 20, pH 7.4 (PBS with Tween 20 (PBST)), and 10% blocking buffer,
incubating the sera for 16 h at 4 °C and 50 rpm orbital shaking.
Peptide microarrays were washed three times with PBST, followed by
incubation with a 1:2500 dilution of the secondary antibody (goat
anti-human IgG Fc specific DyLight 680; Rockland) together with the
control antibody diluted by 1:500 (anti-c-Myc antibody, PEPperPRINT,
Germany) for 30 min at room temperature and 120 rpm orbital shaking.
The peptide microarrays were washed for 3 × 10 s with PBST and
rinsed with deionized water. After drying in a stream of air, fluorescent
images were acquired using an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR) at 700
nm, with a resolution of 21 μm and a scanning sensitivity of
7. Image analysis and quantification was performed with PepSlide Analyzer
software (Sicasys Software GmbH; Heidelberg, Germany).

Samples
used for the peptide array experiments were collected from individuals
with acute febrile illnesses enrolled in a prospective cohort study
from May 2015 to May 2016. The cohort was established in an urgent
health care clinic in the Recife metropolitan region as part of the
International Research Consortium on Dengue Risk Assessment, Management,
and Surveillance-IDAMS.41,42 The ages of patients
from whom sera were used for the assays varied from 9 to 57 years,
wherein 16 were females and 13 were males. Sample collection was performed
on the first day of recruitment (Day 1 – acute sample), which
following the IDAMS protocol corresponds to the period within the
first 72 h of the febrile period, and in the convalescent phase (days
10–30 after recruitment – convalescent sample). For
molecular viral diagnosis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for
DENV and ZIKV was performed following modified previously reported
protocols.43,44 As for serology, samples were
assayed for antiDENV IgM and IgG and antiZIKV IgM through ELISA. The
Panbio Dengue Capture ELISA was used for the antiDENV IgM and IgG
assays, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The antiZIKV
IgM MAC-ELISA protocol was that of the Centers for Diseases Control
and Prevention (CDC).43,45 According to assay results, each
sample was classified as: (1) ZIKV Positive/DENV Negative, if they were positive for ZIKV qRT-PCR and negative for DENV qRT-PCR
in the acute phase and/or positive for antiZIKV IgM with titers >
2 times those for antiDENV IgM in the convalescent phase in the MAC-ELISA,
and negative for antiDENV IgG in the acute phase in the Panbio assay;
(2) ZIKV Negative/DENV Negative, if they were negative
for DENV and ZIKV qRT-PCRs in the acute phase and negative for antiDENV
and antiZIKV IgM in the acute phase in MAC-ELISA and negative for
antiDENV IgG in both acute and convalescent phases in the Panbio assay.
The Panbio indirect antiDENV IgM and IgG test was not performed. Additionally,
one serum sample used in this study was collected from a 21 year old
male individual enrolled in the prospective cohort study PRONEX established
in the city of Recife, Brazil. The sample was collected on day 2 after
the onset of symptoms and its serological status determined as negative
for DENV IgM and IgG ELISAs and positive in the ZIKV IgM ELISA.

Sequence Identity Analysis
ZIKV NS1 selected regions’
sequences were aligned with DENV serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and
DENV4) using the basic local alignment search tool provided by National
Center for Biotechnology Information – NCBI46 to obtain their sequence identity content. The same procedure
was done with the complete sequence and for the sequence excluding
the putative epitopes. Accession codes: DENV1 (AHK09916.1, AHK09915.1,

NS1 Glycosylation,
Modeling, and MD Simulations
NS1
structures for Dengue serotype 2 and ZIKV were retrieved from PDB
ID 4O6B(38) and 5K6K,18 respectively. The missing
loops in those structures were modeled using ModLoop tool,47,48 whereas the N-glycosylation motifs located at Asn130
(containing Asn130-Asn131-Ser132 in ZIKV and Asn130-Gln131-Thr132
in DENV2) and Asn207 (containing Asn207-Asp208-Thr209 in both proteins)
were modified using glycosciences modeling tools,49 respectively, with a complex-type and with a high-mannose
type oligosaccharide50 (Figure S3). The electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated
using APBS.51 All MD calculations and remaining
analyses were performed using GROMACS simulation suite, version 5.1.2.39 All atomistic simulations were performed using
GROMOS 54A7 force field for the protein part52 and GROMOS 53A6GLYC parameters set for the glycan moieties.53,54 The glycosylated NS1 structures were explicitly solvated in
18 nm × 18 nm × 18 nm cubic boxes, using periodic boundary
conditions in x, y, and z directions and the SPC water model,55 employing at least 14 Å distance from the outside
of each structure and the box edge. To neutralize the charge of these
systems, Na+ counterions were added, as necessary. The
LINCS method56 was applied to constrain
covalent bond lengths, allowing an integration step of 2 fs after
an initial energy minimization using steepest descent algorithm. A
short-range cutoff radius of 1.4 nm was used for all nonbonded interactions.
Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated through the
reaction-field method,57 with ε =
66. The system was coupled to a thermostat with a reference temperature
of 310 K using the velocity-rescale scheme,58 with a relaxation time of 0.4 ps. Pressure was maintained constant
at 1 bar by isotropic coordinate scaling using Parrinello–Rahman
barostat,59,60 with a coupling constant of 1.0 ps and a
compressibility of 4.5 × 10–5 bar. A 1 ns MD
simulation with positional restraints on all heavy atoms, with a force
constant of 1000 kJ mol –1, was performed as an
equilibration step and was not taken into account to calculate the
average ensemble properties. Subsequently, all systems were further
extended to 200 ns (without positional restraints). Representative
structures were selected from the equilibrated part of trajectories
(last 50 ns) by clustering all the frames generated within this time
scale (employing g_cluster tool from GROMACS suite,
with a 0.4 nm cutoff). Thus, each of ZIKV and DENV2 NS1 MD simulations
provided a single conformational cluster and the representative frames
used for electrostatic surface potential analyses.
