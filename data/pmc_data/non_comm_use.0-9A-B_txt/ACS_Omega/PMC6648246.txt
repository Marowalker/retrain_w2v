We investigate the Auger recombination
(AR) rate in CdSe/CdS core/shell
nanocrystals (NCs) under different interface confinements in terms
of the interface bond relaxation mechanism and Fermi’s golden
rule. We find that the epitaxial layer of CdS can not only depress
the influence of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes,
but can also change the wave function and quantum confinement, resulting
in the reduction of the AR rate. Moreover, the AR lifetime of CdSe/CdS
core/shell NCs at a fixed entire dimension is lower than that of bare
CdSe because of interface confinement of the wave function. A great
drop of the AR rate can be achieved by adding an alloying layer that
depresses the interface effect. Our predictions are in agreement with
the available evidence, suggesting that the proposed approach could
provide a general method to explore the AR process in core/shell NCs.

Introduction
The Auger recombination (AR) process in
nanocrystals (NCs) has
become one of the hottest topics in fundamental scientific issues
as it takes major responsibility for nonradiative loss, which can
decay the dynamics of multiexcitons, induce fluorescence intermittency,
cause loss of energy in the form of heat, and so on.1−3 To date, various methods have been carried out to explore the geometry,
shape, and surface carrier trap assistance effects on the AR process
both theoretically4−11 and experimentally.12−19 In particular, compared with bare nanosolids, the core/shell nanostructures
show a different AR process.20 The epitaxial
layer in the core/shell nanostructures can offer a new pathway to
separate the electron and hole because the electron (or hole) may
delocalize over the entire core/shell nanostructures.21,22

In general, with the size of a specimen down to the nanoscale,
the effect of strong spatial confinement plays an important role in
the properties of nanostructures in terms of box thinking, which can
relax the translational momentum conservation and increase the magnitude
of Coulomb coupling, thereby allowing for an efficient AR rate.22,23 Thus, the increment of core size can reduce the quantum confinement
and Coulomb interaction, which is of great benefit to block the AR
process.24 Covering an epitaxial layer
on the NCs can not only reduce the Coulomb interaction, but also modulate
the overlap of electron–hole and control the conduction- and
valence-band mixing as well as make the deep band states more delocalized,
resulting in the depression of the AR rate.9,25−27 Moreover, for the case of core/shell NCs, as the
local strain induced by the mismatch between the core and the shell
can provide an additional driving force, it might expect to be accompanied
by interdiffusion ions at the interface to form the core/alloying/shell
NCs, leading to the “smoothing” confinement potential,
and thereby suppress the AR process (called “interface engineering”).28,29 Efros et al.6,30 indicated that the interface
engineering on an identical one-dimensional potential can reduce the
strength of the intraband transition and confinement potential involved
in AR or even lead to nonblinking in nanostructures. Klimov et al.31−33 demonstrated a systematic increase in biexciton lifetimes of core/shell
NCs with interface engineering compared with that of a sharp interface.
Even though a lot of significant efforts have been put forward to
illustrate the AR process in NCs, the influences of geometry and shape
effects on the AR rate are still under-debated because of the discrepancy
between experiment and theory. For example, some studies have shown
a linear dependence of the Auger process on the volume and superposition
principle,22,34 whereas others exhibit an on-monotone
curve of biexciton Auger lifetime in core/shell nanostructures.10,20 Therefore, with those discrepancies between experimental measurements
and theoretical predictions, it is necessary to understand how the
size and interface confinement affect the AR process and establish
a systematic study to pursue the mechanism regarding interface engineering.

In order to clarify the influence of the size and interface confinement
effects on the AR process, in this contribution, we develop a theoretical
model to address the depression mechanism of the AR process in the
core/shell NCs in terms of the bond relaxation method and Fermi’s
golden rule. Our results indicate that geometry parameters and interface
confinement conditions have a great impact on the energy of surface
and interface atoms, electronic structures, and wave function, which
determines the AR lifetime in core/shell NCs. Furthermore, the underlying
mechanism of the discrepancy among AR lifetimes on NCs with different
interface confinements is also discussed.

Principle
In general,
owing to the high ratio of surface-to-volume (SVR)
and surface defects in nanostructures, the atomic coherency will be
modified, resulting in the physical–chemical properties deviated
from the bulk cases.35,36 According to the atomic-bond-relaxation
(ABR) mechanism,37−39 lattice strain and strain energy induced by the edge
active atoms would take place, leading to the bond of the atoms being
shorter and stronger and thereby allowing for modification of the
cohesive energy and forcing the system into a self-equilibrium state.
Generally, the cohesive energy of a specimen is expressed by Ecoh = zEb, where Eb and z are the single bond
energy in bulk and the atomic coordination numbers (CNs), respectively.
However, with the influence of the coordination deficiency and lattice
mismatch, the single bonds and CNs at the interface atoms would be
changed. Therefore, the cohesive energy of the core part must be replaced
by 1  and  with  where N and Nint are,
respectively, the number of total atoms in the
core and atoms in the interface, Ei is the single bond energy of surface atoms, zi and Ni are the CNs and atomic numbers of surface atoms,
respectively, ns is the surface shell
number, Ec–s and xm = 0.5 are the interfacial bond formation enthalpy and
the interface atoms molar ratio, respectively, εr(zr),
εθ(zθ), and
εz(zz) are the lattice strain (effective CNs) of the core
in the radial, tangential, and axial directions, respectively, S and d0 denote the cross section
area and bond length of an atom, respectively, G = vp/[((D/2 + H)2 – (D/2)2) + k(D/2)2], vp = (vc + vs)/2, the bulk Young’s modulus and Poisson’s
ratio in the core (shell) are Yc (Ys) and vc (vs), k = Yc/Ys, f = (vp + 1)/[(1 – k) (1 –
2vp) (D/2)2 – (1 – 2vp + k)(D/2 + H)2], where H and D are the thickness of shell and
the diameter of the core, respectively.40,41

Furthermore,
in terms of band theory,38 the width of
the band gap (Eg) can be
calculated by the first Fourier coefficient of the crystal potential
energy, which is proportional to the mean cohesive energy per bond, Eg ∝ Ecoh/⟨z⟩N, where ⟨z⟩ is the mean CNs, γi =
σcid0/D is the SVR ratio, where the shape
factor of a spherical NC is σ = 6, and ci = 2/(1 + exp((12 – zi)/8zi)) is the bond contraction coefficient. Therefore, the band
gap of NCs can be expressed by 2  where γint = 4dint(1 + εr)/D and Egb are the interface-to-volume ratio and
band
gap of the bulk, respectively.

With the aim of addressing the
relationship between interface confinement
and the AR process, we consider that the AR rate from the excited
state ψi to the final state ψf can
be obtained by using Fermi’s golden rule23,42 3  with  τA presents the lifetime
of the AR, V = e2/(κ|r⃗\1 – r⃗2|) is the electron Coulomb potential, ℏ = h/2π, Ei(Ef) are the energies of the initial (final) states, and h and κ denote Planck’s constant and dielectric
constant, respectively. MA is the matrix
element of the interparticle Coulomb interaction. We assume that MA is independent of the projection of the total
momentum because of spherical symmetry. Therefore, MA is determined by the final state with k = 1 and can be calculated by the standard technique of the multipole
expansion of the Coulomb potential. Introducing x′ = r1/a and x = r2/a, the Auger ionization rate can be deduced as 4  where χ(κs, κg)−1 = 1 – sin(κsD)/κsD +
2 sin2 (κsD/2)
(Eg + 2E)/κgD(Egm + 2E), |C0|2 is a constant, κg2 = [(Egm/2)2 – E2]/(ℏ2|V|2), κs2 = [E2 – (Eg/2)2]/(ℏ2|V|2), Egm, V, Ee, E0, E, and kg are the energy gap
in the matrix material, the Kane matrix element, a free electron energy,
the size-quantized electron ground-state energy, the energy of the
state measured from the middle of the energy gap, and the ejected
electron quasimomentum, respectively, and Δ+(1, kg) and Δ–(1, kg) can be obtained by spherical Bessel functions
of the second kind. In the case of Δ+(1, kg) ⇒ 1/(kgD/2)2, Δ–(1, kg) ⇒ 0, ℏ2|V|2/(DEg/2)2≪1, and χ ≈ 1. In addition,
the matrix element can be expressed as MA = J<(ks, κs) + f(κsD, κgD)J>(kg, κg),
where f(κsD, κgD) and J<(J>) are a function of (κsD, κgD) and an
integral
term, respectively.23 Therefore, MA can be obtained by a product of a rapidly
oscillating function and a smooth function f(r⃗). Thus, MA = ⟨f(r⃗)exp(ik⃗r⃗)⟩ ≈ f′|a(akf)−2 + f″|a(akf)−3 + f‴|a(akf)−4,39,43 (akf)−2 ≈ (akf)−3 ≈ 0 ,and MA ∝ f‴|(akf)−4. Moreover, considering the discrepancy between the
core and shell, the electron–hole spatial separation and wave
function will be changed in the interface of the core/shell nanostructures.
Physically, the AR rate of the NC is proportional to the square of
the ground-state wave function, 1/τA ∝ |φ0(kf)|2, where φ0(kf) can be given by an exponential
term, ∫–∞∞dxϕ0(x)exp(ikfx), where ϕ0(x) is the wave function
of a single-hole(electron) ground state.6 Therefore, we suggest that the AR lifetime of the NC is modified
by the shell thickness with exponential decay, exp(α/(H + βL)). Thus, the AR lifetime is 5  where A, α, and β
are the constants determined by the core, shell, and alloy layer, Egm is the energy gap, εq is the quantum
size energy of NCs, me is the effective
mass of electron, D is the diameter of NCs (QDs),
whereas the diameter of the core/shell and core/alloying layer/shell
are, respectively, D + 2H and D + 2H + 2L, where H and L denote the thickness of shell and
alloy layer, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figures 1 and 4.

the schematic illustration of core/shell NCs. The formation enthalpy
of an interfacial bond is obtained from ref (58), Ec–s = 0.18 eV.

Results and Discussion
In order to clarify the AR phenomenon
of the semiconductor nanostructures
with different interface confinements, we take CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdSeS/CdS
wurtzite core/shell and core/alloying/shell NCs as examples to evaluate
the interface effect on the trion AR lifetime. The necessary parameters
are listed in Table 1. Note that in our case, the nanostructure is an idealized structure
with identical bands and the carrier traps are ignored.

Using eq 2, the size-
and shell-dependent band gap of CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs can be calculated,
as shown in Figure 1. Evidently, the band gap of NCs decreases with increasing diameter
and shell thickness. These results are expected as the SVR and the
influence of quantum confinement, lattice strain, and strain energy
decrease with increasing NC diameter and shell thickness. Moreover,
it is clear to see that when the total diameter is fixed, the band
gap of bare CdSe NCs may be lower than that of core/shell NCs to a
large extent. In fact, although increasing the shell thickness can
reduce the quantum confinement, lattice strain, and related strain
energy, the interface effect may also be induced in core/shell NCs.
Smith et al.44 demonstrated that the interface
strain decreases with increasing shell thickness, but the strain cannot
decay fully to zero, resulting in a significant amount of elastic
strain. Importantly, our results are well consistent with the available
results.31,45−47

Figure 2 shows the
shell-dependent trion AR lifetime in CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs under
various diameters of the core. Clearly, the AR lifetime of CdSe NCs
increases as the shell thickness enhances. It can be ascribed to the
weak effect of the interface on the AR process. In fact, the shell
of CdS can not only reduce the Coulomb interaction and AR process,
but can also suppress the quantum confinement and control the overlap
between the electron and hole, leading to the slow AR rate.28,48,49 In addition, we also find that
with an increase of shell thickness, the difference of AR lifetime
under various diameters of CdSe NCs decreases. This can be simply
interpreted as the influence of the interface on the band structure,
and the electron–phonon interaction drops gradually. Consequently,
the AR process is mainly determined by the total volume and Coulomb
interaction. Moreover, in order to clarify the impact of the structures
on the AR process, the shell-dependent trion AR lifetime of zinc blende
CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs under D = 3 nm is exhibited
as well. We find that as the bond parameters of wurtzite CdSe are
comparable to those of zinc blende CdSe, the band structures, quantum
size energy, and calculation method are very similar for those two
structures. As a result, τAwurtzite are comparable with τAzinc, and we have
τAwurtzite ≈ 0.93 τAzinc. Efros et al.20 also demonstrated
that the Auger rates of zinc blende CdSe NCs are very close to those
of wurtzite CdSe by using the eight-band k·p method. Note that the nonmonotonic variation of the AR
lifetime is not exhibited in our predictions because the coefficients
of the matrix element are determined by the special points of the
smooth function in our approach. In fact, suppression of Auger rates
was also observed in theories,20 simulations,10 and experiments.28,31 References (10) and (20) show that the AR lifetime
changes nonmonotonically with shell thickness and it is longer in
the thick-shell core/shell NCs. References28,31,50−52 show that the AR lifetime increases monotonically with shell thickness.

Figure 2 Predicted
AR lifetimes as a function of shell thickness in CdSe/CdS
core/shell NCs with D = 3 (blue line), 4 (green line),
and 6 nm (red line). The parameters α = −0.3, β
= 0.5, and A(Egm – Eg) = 6 × 104 are used in our calculation. Note
that some available results of trion AR are obtained by using τA = 4τXX, where τXX is the biexciton lifetime.2

In terms of eq 5,
we calculate the AR lifetimes as a function of total diameter in bare
CdSe and CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs under different core diameters, as
shown in Figure 3.
We can see that both the curves of CdSe/CdS and bare CdSe demonstrate
that the AR lifetime increases with increasing total diameter. However,
if the total diameter is fixed, the AR lifetime of core/shell NCs
is much lower than that of bare NCs. The discrepancy of the AR process
between core/shell and bare NCs can be attributed to the interface
effect. As the influence of the interface effect, the band structure
as well as electron–phonon interaction and wave function in
core/shell NCs would differ from that of bare NCs. Generally, the
influence of the interface effect on wave function exhibits exponential
decay,20 resulting in the AR rate of CdSe/CdS
core/shell NCs being lower than that of bare CdSe when the total diameter
is fixed. Importantly, our results are in good agreement with the
available results. References (20). and (53) show that the AR lifetimes of bare CdSe NCs with 4–9 and
3–6 nm are, respectively, 100 to 104 ps and 50 to
2 ps103 ps, which are larger than that of CdSe/CdS NCs
with an identical diameter. Furthermore, as plotted in Figure 3, we find that if the core
diameter of CdSe is fixed, the difference between the AR lifetimes
of D = 3, 4, and 6 nm becomes weak. In detail, the
AR lifetimes of 3, 4, and 6 nm CdSe with 1.5, 1, and 0 nm CdS coating
(the total diameter in each of these three samples is 6 nm) are, respectively,
378, 480, and 1792 ps, whereas each of these results is close to 104 ps for that of 4, 3.5, and 2.5 nm CdS coating. This trend
is expected as the influence of the interface on the electronic properties
decreases with increasing shell thickness, and the electron–phonon
interaction and wave function of CdSe NCs become a constant. Similarly,
Vaxenburg et al.20 reported that the AR
lifetimes of CdSe–CdS with 6 nm (the diameters of the core
and shell thickness are, respectively, 3 and 1.5 nm) and 11 nm (the
diameter and shell thickness are, respectively, 3 and 4 nm) total
diameter are, respectively, about 300 and 104 ps, whereas
these results are 103 and 104 ps for the same
total diameter (with the core diameter is fixed at 5 nm, but the shell
thickness changed from 0.5 to 3 nm).

Figure 3 Predicted AR lifetimes as a function of
diameter in bare CdSe NCs
(black line) and total diameter, D + 2H, in CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs with D = 3 (blue line),
4 (green line), and 6 nm (red line).

In order to depress the interface effect on the AR lifetime,
an
interface alloying layer, CdSeS, is deliberately embedded in CdSe/CdS
core/shell NCs, as shown in the inset of Figure 4. Moreover, the AR lifetime of CdSe/CdSeS/CdS core/alloying/shell
NCs compared with that of CdSe/CdS core/shell and bare CdSe NCs is
exhibited in Figure 4. Evidently, our results indicate that the AR rate of NCs can be
greatly suppressed by the interface alloying layer because of softening
of the interface effect. However, we can also find that although the
alloying layer is of great benefit to reduce the interface confinement
compared with the CdSe/CdS NCs, the AR lifetime of CdSe/CdSeS/CdS
is still lower than that of bare CdSe if the total diameter is fixed
as the alloying layer cannot completely eliminate the interface effect.
For example, the AR lifetime of CdSe/CdSeS/CdS NCs with D = 3 nm, L = 1.5 nm, and H = 1.5
nm (9 nm total diameter) is 4460 ps, which is about 1.5 and 0.2 times
compared to that of CdSe/CdS with D = 3 nm and H = 3 nm (9 nm total diameter) and bare CdSe with D = 9 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the AR process of CdSe/CdSeS/CdS
NCs also demonstrates that if the diameter of CdSe is fixed, the discrepancy
of the AR lifetimes in L = 0, 1.5, and 3 nm becomes
weak with increasing total diameter. Importantly, our predictions
suggest that to further reduce the AR process, one may use the CdSe1–xSx with
change in the x from 0 to 1 to replace CdSeS. The
gradual change of the alloying layer may provide more “smoothing”
confinement potential compared to CdSeS because of its continuous
interface. Klimov et al.33,34 observed that the AR
of the CdSe/CdS core/shell with a graded alloying interface CdSexS1–x (x change from 0 to 1) can be greatly suppressed compared
with that of CdSe/CdS without the alloying interface. Note that in
our calculation, the system is an idealized structure and the influences
of the surface trap, valence band, interface softening, and surround
effect are ignored so that our predictions may not fit well to some
experimental measurements, such as Bae’s results,50 but are in exceedingly good agreement with those
of the simulations and the k·p method.20

as a function of diameter in bare CdSe NCs
(black line) and total diameter, D + 2L + 2H, in CdSe/CdSeS/CdS core/alloy layer/shell
NCs with D = 3 and L = 0 for the
blue line, D = 3 and L = 1.5 for
the green line, and D = 3 and L =
6 nm for the red line.

Conclusions
In summary, we proposed an analytical model
to address the depression
mechanism of the AR rate of core/shell NCs based on the ABR consideration
and Fermi’s golden rule. Our results show that the surface
and interface effects can lead to the changes of Coulomb interaction
and overlap of electron–hole, thereby allowing for an efficient
AR process in NCs. However, increasing the core size and shell thickness
in NCs can suppress the AR process effectively because of reduction
of the Coulomb interaction and modulation of overlap of the electron–hole.
Moreover, our results clarify that the AR lifetime in core/shell NCs
can be substantially suppressed in the AR process by covering an alloying
layer in the interface that softens the interface confinement on the
wave function. However, as the alloying layer cannot completely eliminate
the interface effect, the AR lifetime of the core/alloying/shell is
still lower than that of bare NCs if the total diameter is fixed.
These results indicate that the suppression of the AR process can
be achieved by not only increasing the size of the nanostructures
that reduces the Coulomb interaction but also softening the interface
confinement of nanostructures that modulates the quantum size energy
and wave function.
