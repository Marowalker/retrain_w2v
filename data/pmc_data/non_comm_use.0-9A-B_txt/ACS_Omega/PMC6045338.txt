In recent decades, drug delivery
systems (DDSs) based on polymer
nanoparticles have been explored due to their potential to deliver
drugs with poor water solubility. Some of the limitations of nanoparticle-based
DDSs can be overcome by developing an appropriate polymer prodrug.
In this work, poly(NIPA)-b-poly(HMNPPA)-b-poly(PEGMA-stat-BA) was synthesized using reversible
addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and Chlorambucil
(Cbl), an anticancer drug, was conjugated to the copolymer via 3-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-4-nitrophenoxy)propyl
acrylate (HMNPPA) units to prepare the prodrug. A few biotin acrylate
(BA) units were also incorporated to bring potential targeting capability
to the prodrug in the copolymer. This polymer prodrug formed spherical
micellar nanoparticles in physiological conditions, which were characterized
by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy measurements.
The very low critical aggregation concentration (cac) (0.011 mg/mL)
of the prodrug, as measured from Nile Red fluorescence, makes it stable
against dilution. The polymer prodrug was shown to release Cbl on
photoirradiation by soft UV (λ ≥ 365 nm) and laser (λ
= 405 nm) light. The prodrug micellar nanoparticles were capable of
encapsulating a second drug (doxorubicin, DOX) in their hydrophobic
core. On photoirradiation with UV and laser light of the DOX-loaded
nanoparticles, both Cbl and DOX were released. Light-induced breaking
of photolabile ester bond resulted in the release of Cbl and caused
disruption of the nanoparticles facilitating release of DOX. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay confirmed the nontoxicity of the polymers and effectiveness
of the dual drug-loaded micellar nanoparticles toward cancer cells.
Confocal microscopy results showed a better cellular internalization
capability of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles in cancer cells, possibly
due to the presence of cancer cell targeting biotin molecules in the
polymer. This new photoresponsive potentially biocompatible and cancer
cell-targeted polymer prodrug may be useful for delivery of single
and/or multiple hydrophobic drugs.

Introduction
In recent decades,
tremendous efforts have been made to improve
the available anticancer therapies, and chemotherapy has emerged as
the most promising of these therapeutic applications. In this context,
drug delivery vehicles based on polymer nanoparticles have been explored
due to their ability to successfully deliver poorly aqueous soluble
drugs like Doxorubicin (DOX).1−3 In spite of a few promising results,
most of these polymeric nanoparticle drug delivery systems (DDSs)
have limitations, which has hampered their further translation to
the clinic and eventually to the market. Polymer–drug conjugates
could be an alternative delivery technology in the development pipeline.
Conjugation of a drug with a polymer forms a so-called “polymer
prodrug”. A polymer prodrug is a kind of therapeutic where
the bioactive agent is not encapsulated but covalently linked to a
biocompatible polymeric carrier.4,5 The “prodrug”
approach provides a powerful means of drug modification, for example,
solubilization of hydrophobic drugs, elimination of initial burst
release of drug micelles, and tuning of drug pharmacokinetics.6

There is an increasing interest among scientists
to synthesize
biocompatible amphiphilic photoresponsive polymer prodrug systems.
The amphiphilic block copolymers generally have a tendency to self-assemble
in aqueous medium to form stable nanoparticles like micelles7,8 and vesicles.9,10 These nanoparticles are known
to be potent carriers of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic molecules
in aqueous solution. Attachment of stimuli-responsive functional groups
to the block copolymers can form smart micellar nanoparticles that
can be used as stimuli-regulated drug release systems.11,12 For biomedical application, the smart nanoparticles should be biocompatible,
nontoxic in nature, and preferably biodegradable. In this context,
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based block copolymers have often been
chosen for drug delivery systems due to their nontoxicity, high water
solubility, excellent biocompatibility, and prolonged circulation
time in blood stream.13 Such properties
make PEG-containing stimuli-responsive polymers excellent candidates
for drug delivery systems (DDSs).14,15 Similarly,
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA)-based polymeric
systems have also been explored as DDSs.16,17

Recently, the combined administration of different drugs to
enhance
therapeutic effect has gained great attention.18,19 Dual drug delivery systems (DDDS) are those that are capable of
releasing two drugs from the same carrier.20 There has been a continuous necessity to overcome the main drawback
in combined therapy, which is to regulate each drug release in a controlled
manner.21 Another aspect that needs to
be considered is how to deliver drug in a cell-specific manner. Recently,
the passive targeting strategy has been widely used in anticancer
application through enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect.22−24 PEGylation results in longer circulation times for DDSs in cancer
cells via EPR effect for the passive targeting strategy.25 However, PEGylation significantly hampers endocytic
uptake and endosomal escape by cancer cells. This so-called “PEG
dilemma” causes significant loss of activity of drug carriers.26 To resolve the problem of the PEG dilemma in
the passive targeting strategy and to increase the cellular uptake,
active targeting has been introduced that exploits specific ligands
including protein antibodies and peptides that can recognize and bind
to the specific proteins or antigens expressed on cancer cells.27 Among these ligands, biotin, a low molecular
weight vitamin, plays a significant role in all cell divisions, especially
for the growth of cancer cells. Biotin binds to the biotin receptors,
and it has been shown that biotin receptors are over expressed in
cancer cells over normal cells.28,29

In this work,
we have investigated photoresponsive biotin-functionalized
polymer prodrug micellar nanoparticles as a dual drug delivery system
as well as a single drug delivery system (SDDS). Accordingly, we have
synthesized an amphiphilic block copolymer, poly(NIPA)-b-poly(HMNPPA)-b-poly(PEGMA-stat-BA), containing a few biotin acrylate (BA) repeat units. The anticancer
drug Chlorambucil (Cbl) was conjugated to the copolymer via 3-(3-hydroxy
methyl-4-nitrophenoxy)propyl acrylate (HMNPPA) units to prepare the
prodrug. This potential cancer cell targeting polymer prodrug was
investigated as a photoresponsive drug carrier. Doxorubicin was further
loaded in the micellar nanoparticles formed by the prodrug in physiological
conditions. It was observed that the prodrug and DOX-loaded prodrug
can be employed to deliver a single drug and two drugs, respectively,
by irradiating with soft UV light (≥365 nm) or laser light
(405 nm).

Results and Discussion
Considering the importance of
photoresponsive drug delivery systems,
we synthesized a new photoresponsive block copolymer prodrug containing
a photoreleasable anticancer drug, Cbl. Moreover, to enhance the therapeutic
efficiency and make the prodrug more potent in cancer drug delivery,
a targeting moiety (biotin) was conjugated with the block copolymer.
Moreover, a second anticancer drug, DOX, was coloaded in the nanoparticles
formed by the self-assembly of the prodrug to further improve the
utility of the drug delivery system. Phototriggered drug delivery
from this polymer-based system was investigated by the illumination
of laser light (λ = 405 nm) and soft UV (λ ≥ 365
nm) in vitro.

Synthesis of the Monomers, Block Copolymers, and Polymer Prodrug
Synthesis
of the Monomers
3-(3-(Hydroxymethyl)-4-nitrophenoxy)propyl
acrylate (HMNPPA) was prepared from 3-bromopropyl acrylate as described
in the Materials section (Scheme 1). 4-Hydroxy-2-nitrobenzyl
alcohol and K2CO3 were dissolved in dry dimethylformamide
(DMF) and allowed to stir for 45 min under a N2 atmosphere
at 70 °C. After that, 3-bromopropyl acrylate dissolved in dry
DMF was added slowly to the solution. The reaction mixture was allowed
to stir for 2 days at the same reaction conditions. The crude product
was purified by column chromatography of silica gel and the desired
product was found as a yellow solid with 58% yield. The monomer was
characterized by proton NMR (Figure 1) and 13C NMR (Figure S2, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1, the peak at 8.14–8.11 ppm is due
to the deshielded nature of the Ar proton closer to the NO2 group and peaks at 7.34 and 7.04–7.02 ppm relate to the other
two Ar protons in HMNPPA. The peaks at 6.36–6.31, 6.22–6.15,
and 5.96–5.93 ppm are due to vinylic protons that confirm the
presence of acrylate moieties in HMNPPA, peaks at 5.59–5.56
and 4.85–4.84 ppm are due to benzylic OH and benzylic CH2, respectively. The peaks at 4.29–4.26, 4.23–4.12,
and 2.15–2.08 ppm are attributed to the propyl moiety in HMNPPA
and confirm the successful synthesis of HMNPPA. Successful synthesis
of HMNPPA was furthered confirmed by 13C NMR.

acrylate (HMNPPA).

Scheme 1 Synthesis Scheme
of Photocleavable Monomer 3-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-4-nitrophenoxy)propyl
acrylate (HMNPPA)
As shown in Figure S2, the 13C NMR signal at 166.30 ppm is due to the carbonyl carbon
of the ester
group. The 13C NMR signals at 163.53, 140.58, 140.47, 128.31,
114.57, and 113.73 ppm are attributed to Ar carbons and signals at
131.30 and 128.12 ppm correspond to vinylic carbons in HMNPPA. The
propyl moiety in HMNPPA was signified by the signals at 65.35, 63.00,
and 28.56 ppm. The significant 13C NMR signal of benzylic
carbon arises at 61.11 ppm.

Biotin acrylate was synthesized
by a similar method to that for
HMNPPA. d-Biotin and K2CO3 were dissolved
in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) for 45 min at 70 °C under stirring.
3-Bromopropyl acrylate in dry DMF was slowly added to the reaction
mixture and allowed to stir for 48 h at the same reaction condition.
A pure product was found as an off white solid after recrystallization
from ether. BA was characterized by proton NMR (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and 13C NMR
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). As
shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information,
proton NMR signals at 6.41–6.30, 6.20–6.13, and 5.96–5.93
ppm signify the vinylic protons and NH protons of BA. The propyl moiety
in BA was confirmed by the corresponding signals at 4.18–4.07
and 1.96–1.90 ppm. The proton NMR signals for the biotin moiety
in BA were confirmed by the proton NMR signals at 6.41–6.30,
4.31–4.28, 4.18–4.07, 3.11–3.06, 2.83–2.79,
2.59–2.53, 2.31–2.27, 1.65–1.4, and 1.36–1.29
ppm. BA was furthered confirmed by 13C NMR (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The 13C NMR signal at 173.59 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon
of the ester linkage and the peak at 166.13 ppm is due to the carbonyl
carbon of the acrylate moiety in BA. Vinylic carbons in BA showed 13C NMR signals at 130.99 and 128.26 ppm. The propyl moiety
showed its significant 13C NMR signals at 61.14, 60.94,
and 27.97 ppm. 13C NMR signals due to the biotin moiety
are 163.65, 62.00, 60.18, 55.42, 40.53, 33.85, 28.36, 28.24, and 24.76
ppm.

Synthesis of the Block Copolymers
Poly(NIPA)-b-poly(HMNPPA) copolymer (P1) was synthesized
by the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) technique,
as depicted in Scheme 2. At first, P0 was prepared using BCTPA as a chain transfer
agent (CTA),30 as confirmed by 1H NMR (Figure S5, Supporting Information).
The molecular weight of P0 was determined by the absolute
GPC method (Figure 2) using dn/dc of the polymer as
0.12, determined at 30 °C in tetrahydrofuran (THF) using a differential
refractometer. The molecular weight of P0 was found to
be Mw = 4200 g/mol, Mn = 3900 g/mol, and polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.07,
which corresponds to 34 NIPA units per polymer chain. P0 was further used as the CTA for the controlled polymerization of
HMNPPA to form P1. Incorporation of HMNPPA in the copolymer
was confirmed from proton NMR (Figure 3), as is evident from the appearance of the peaks at
4.14 ppm due to two CH2 groups of the propyl chain in HMNPPA,
5.00 ppm due to benzylic CH2 of HMNPPA, and 8.09 ppm due
to the most down shielded aryl proton near to the NO2 group.
Molecular weight of P1 was determined as above using
dn/dc as 0.108 and found to be Mw = 6350, Mn = 6000,
and PDI = 1.07, which implies that the number of HMNPPA units per P1 chain was equal to seven. The third block was synthesized
by radically polymerizing a mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl
ether acrylate (Mw = 480) and biotin acrylate
(BA) in the presence of P1, which acted as chain transfer
agent. The presence of poly(ethylene glycol) grafts is expected to
increase the water solubility of the block copolymer in physiological
temperature (at 37 °C) and the presence of biotin is expected
to impart targeting ability to the polymer prodrug toward cancer cells.
Incorporation of PEG moieties and BA moieties in P2 was
confirmed by proton NMR (Figure 4) and GPC (Figure 2). The 1H NMR peaks of P2 at
2.75, 2.90, 3.18, 4.32, and 4.51 ppm are due to BA and those at 3.37,
3.64, and 4.15 ppm are due to PEGMA moieties. The molecular weight
of P2 was determined by GPC as Mw = 11 150 g/mol, Mn 9650
g/mol and PDI 1.15 using dn/dc as
0.08.

and P3.

Synthesis of Polymer Prodrug (P3)
P2 was further utilized for DCC coupling with Cbl, an anticancer
drug, to form prodrug P3. Coupling of Cbl with the HMNPPA
moieties in the block copolymer was confirmed by proton NMR (Figure 5). The peak corresponding
to benzylic CH2 was shifted to 5.47 ppm due to formation
of the ester bond. The molecular weight of P3 was determined
to be Mw ∼ 13 650 g/mol, Mn ∼ 11 600, and PDI 1.17 using
dn/dc as 0.09 (Figure 2). The summary of the block
copolymer characterization data is provided in Table 1.

Formation
of Self-Assembled Nanoparticles from P3
We synthesized
a new photoresponsive amphiphilic triblock
copolymer prodrug, P3, which contains poly(NIPA34), poly(HMNPPA7Cbl) and poly(PEGMA8-stat-BA2). Amphiphilic block copolymers are well
known for their self-assembling behavior in aqueous solution. To probe
whether P3 undergoes self-assembly in aqueous solution,
we monitored the fluorescence of Nile Red in aqueous solutions of
increasing concentration of P3. Nile Red has been used
for probing the self-assembly of polymers in aqueous solution by previous
researchers as well.31 As shown in Figure 6, initially, the
fluorescence intensity of Nile Red (at 626 nm) was relatively low
and nearly independent of P3 concentration till a certain
concentration, above which, the fluorescence intensity increased drastically,
indicating formation of hydrophobic pockets where Nile Red started
getting encapsulated. This indicates the formation of self-assembled
nanoparticles from P3 above a certain concentration.
The concentration corresponding to the inflection point was considered
as the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of the prodrug P3. The cac value was found to be 0.011 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer at physiological pH at 37 °C, which is significantly
lower than the cac values generally observed for common amphiphilic
block copolymers reported in the literature.32,33 A very low cac for P3 is expected to provide excellent
stability against dilution when injected into the blood.

emission intensity of Nile Red at 626 nm vs
prodrug concentration (mg/mL) in water at 37 °C and pH = 7.4.

Formation of self-assembled nanoparticles
from P3 was
furthered investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements
as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies with 1 mg/mL concentration
of P3 in PBS buffer at physiological pH at 37 °C.
TEM measurements revealed that the nanoparticles had spherical morphology
with an average diameter of around 200 nm, confirming the formation
of spherical micelles (Figure 7a). DLS was used to determine the size of the micelles of P3 and the result showed (Figure 7b) that the intensity-average hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) was 150 nm, which was a
little lower than the size found in TEM measurements. The slightly
higher size obtained in TEM could be due to flattening of micellar
nanoparticles during sample preparation.

Phototriggered Release of Chlorambucil (Cbl) from the Prodrug
Nanoparticles
Stimuli-responsive micellar nanoparticles are
one of the most potent carriers of hydrophobic drug molecules.34,35 In this work, we synthesized polymer prodrug P3 containing
Cbl by DCC coupling, which can work as a photoresponsive Cbl delivery
system. Cbl is known to alkylate DNA, inducing DNA damage.36,37 As shown in Figure 8, P2 exhibited absorption maxima at 313 nm and P3 exhibited a broad absorption peak in the range from 200
to 450 nm with absorption maxima at 300 and 259 nm at pH 7.4. The
presence of a NO2 group in the phenyl ring is responsible
for the UV absorption maximum at 313 nm in P2, and the
conjugated Cbl drug with HMNPPA moieties in P3 is responsible
for the absorption maxima at 300 and 259 nm. Hence, we used soft UV
light (λ ≥ 365 nm) to investigate the photoresponsive
release as P3 exhibits broad absorption in the range
from 200 to 450 nm. To demonstrate the ability of P3 to
release Cbl on photoirradiation, absorbance of P3 was
monitored after UV irradiation of specific durations. The UV–vis
absorbance measurements were carried out after waiting for 30 min
post irradiation to let the released insoluble Cbl settle down. Figure 9a shows that the
intensity at 259 and 300 nm decreased with more irradiation time,
which indicated the release of Cbl molecules from the prodrug. Figure 9b shows the drug
release profile of prodrug P3 on UV irradiation by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurement. The released drug from P3 on UV irradiation for 1 h was found to be 50 and 56%, as
determined by UV–vis spectroscopy and HPLC, respectively.

prodrug P3 in aqueous solution at pH

in 1% methanol in water.

Coloading of Doxorubicin in the Prodrug Nanoparticles and Phototriggered
Release of Two Drugs from Nanoparticles
To enhance the therapeutic
efficiency of P3 in cancer treatment, DOX was coloaded
as a second drug into the P3 nanoparticles. The drug
loading capacity (DLC) and drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) of
DOX was found to be 19.6 and 61.0%, respectively, establishing the
drug-encapsulating ability of the polymer prodrug. DOX-loaded micelles
in PBS buffer at 37 °C were characterized by DLS and TEM measurements.
The DLS results showed that after drug loading, the size of P3 nanoparticles increased from 150 to 440 nm (Figure 10a). This DLS result was also
supported by TEM, which also showed an increase in average size to
480 nm from 200 nm on loading of DOX in P3 prodrug (Figure 10b). Prodrug nanoparticles
got swollen to a significant extent due to encapsulation of DOX in
the hydrophobic core as seen from the TEM images. The stability of P3 and P3–DOX nanoparticles was monitored
by DLS and absorbance study, and recording the fluorescence of DOX
in P3–DOX nanoparticles. No significant change
in the size, absorbance, and DOX fluorescence was observed for the
duration of studies, suggesting the stable nature of the prodrug P3
and DOX-loaded prodrug (Figures S6–S8, Supporting Information).

prodrug nanoparticles

for 1 h by UV light (λ ≥ 365 nm) at 37 °C in PBS
buffer (pH 7.4).

DLS and TEM measurements
were performed to monitor the fate of
the nanoparticles on photoirradiation along with following the release
of the two drugs, namely, Cbl and DOX. At first, the measurements
were carried out on P3–DOX nanoparticles on which
UV irradiation had been performed for 1 h. The hydrodynamic size for
this UV-irradiated sample obtained from DLS was not stable. The size
was increasing, although slowly, with time. Hence, we think that the
aggregates that were formed post micellar disruption were not very
well-defined and were probably formed by loose attachment of the polymer
chains. The TEM image of the UV-irradiated DOX-loaded nanoparticles
is presented in Figure 10c and shows that the loaded spherical structures of the micelle
nanoparticles were disrupted and turned into irregular shaped aggregated
structures. The sample for the TEM image presented in Figure 10c was prepared within 30 min
of the UV irradiation before a significant extent of aggregation took
effect. A similar effect on the size was also observed for 1 h laser
irradiation on the DOX-loaded nanoparticles by DLS size measurement,
which revealed that laser can also cause disruption of micellar nanoparticles.
On photoirradiation, the hydrophobic HMNPPA moieties were converted
to hydrophilic 3-(3-formyl-4-nitrosophenoxy)propyl acetate (FNPPA)
moieties38 (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which caused disruption of the P3 micelles. Detachment of the Cbl moieties was evident from
the decrease of the peaks corresponding to Cbl in the UV–vis
spectra recorded for UV-irradiated DOX-loaded nanoparticles. The disruption
of micellar nanoparticles also triggered release of DOX from the nanoparticles,
which is evident from the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of
DOX in the nanoparticles on UV irradiation (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

To investigate the effect
of laser irradiation on P3–DOX nanoparticles,
the buffer solution of nanoparticles was
also irradiated by laser light (λ = 405 nm) for different durations,
and the release of the two drugs was followed spectroscopically. Generally,
laser light is more preferred as a phototrigger as the lower energy
of laser causes less damage to normal cells.39Figure 11a,b shows
the UV–vis and fluorescence spectra recorded for laser-irradiated
DOX-loaded nanoparticles. A gradual decrease in the absorbance and
fluorescence intensity of DOX confirms release of DOX from the hydrophobic
interior of the nanoparticles to the aqueous medium.

Figure 11 (a) UV absorbance and
(b) fluorescence spectra of P3–DOX prodrug nanoparticles
after irradiation with laser (λ
= 405 nm) for various durations.

The cumulative drug release profiles were plotted against
the duration
of UV or laser irradiation. It can be noted from Figure 12 that the DOX release percentages
are quite close for both cases. 54.7% of loaded DOX was released by
UV exposure on P3–DOX nanoparticles whereas 50.3%
of loaded DOX was released by laser exposure. It could be concluded
that DOX release did not significantly differ for the two different
external light sources. Both UV or laser irradiation causes micellar
disruption, which releases the encapsulated DOX. It can also be noted
that 27.9% of Cbl was released upon 1 h of UV irradiation from P3–DOX nanoparticles. This value of Cbl release was
lower than the release of Cbl from only P3 (without DOX
loading). This may be because of the slow release of the detached
Cbl molecules from the nanoparticles in which the core contained hydrophobic
DOX molecules. This release percentage further decreased to 19.3%
when laser light was used. Thus, Cbl release from P3 prodrug
could be regulated by the external light source. All observations
showed that P3 nanoparticles themselves can be used as
a photoresponsive controlled drug delivery system for releasing a
single drug (Cbl), whereas P3–DOX nanoparticles
can be used in applications where slow release of multiple drugs is
beneficial.

In Vitro Cytotoxic Effect
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay is the conventional and suitable method for evaluating
cell viability through mitochondrial reductase activity. The cytotoxic
effects of P2, P3, and P3–DOX
along with free DOX were evaluated against normal human dermal fibroblast
cell lines as well as MDA MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cell
lines. Figure 13a
shows the nontoxic nature of P2, P3, and P3–DOX against the normal cells. The P3 treatment against breast cancer cells shows high cell viability
even at very high doses of this prodrug, suggesting the nontoxic nature
of the prodrug (Figure 13b) toward cancer cells. The cell viability in both normal
and cancerous cell lines was significantly high for P3 even at higher doses of 200 μg/mL. In P3–DOX
without UV radiation, Cbl was not released. Therefore, a low cytotoxic
effect after treatment with these P3 prodrug molecules
was observed on the MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell lines. However, P3–DOX shows slightly higher toxicity than P3, indicating the release of DOX from P3–DOX to
some extent. On UV irradiation the cell viability of P3–DOX decreased significantly compared to that without UV irradiation
(Figure 13b). The
IC50 values of free DOX and P3–DOX
(with UV treatment) were found to be 164 and 105 μg/mL, respectively.
The higher cytotoxic effect of UV-irradiated P3–DOX
is likely due to the effect of the dual drugs, namely, Cbl and DOX.
These results confirmed the effectiveness of P3–DOX
as a drug delivery system toward cancer cells.

against (a) normal human dermal fibroblast cell lines and (b) MDA
MB 231 breast cancer cell lines.

In Vitro Cell Uptake Study
In vitro internalization
of DOX and P3–DOX was studied in a time dependent
manner against MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell lines. Under confocal
microscopy, the DOX internalization into the cell was indicated by
red fluorescence of DOX. The nuclei of the cells were stained with
DAPI, which emits blue fluorescence. The intensity of red fluorescence
inside indicates the presence of DOX inside the cells after its uptake
(Figure 14). The study
was carried out after 1, 2, and 4 h of treatment against breast cancer
cell lines. After 4 h of incubation with free DOX, it showed moderate
fluorescence according to its accumulation in the nucleus (Figure S11, Supporting Information). This might
be due to passive diffusion of DOX to the cells. But, in the case
of just P3–DOX, mild red fluorescence was observed
in the cytoplasm, even after 1 h of treatment (Figure 14). Gradually, the red fluorescence intensity
increased and shifted toward the nuclei after further incubation.
The smooth internalization of P3–DOX might be
through an endocytic mechanism into the cells. This study clearly
showed the better cellular internalization capability of P3–DOX than free DOX in cancer cells, possibly due to the presence
of cancer cell targeting biotin molecules in P3. However,
the lower toxicity of P3–DOX toward cancer cells
was due to the slow release of DOX during the first 4 h from P3–DOX, which is expected to drastically improve on
irradiation.

Conclusions
Photoresponsive amphiphilic
poly(NIPA)-b-poly(HMNPPA)-b-poly(PEGMA-stat-BA) was successfully
synthesized using RAFT polymerization. Chlorambucil was conjugated
via a photoresponsive bond, and biotin acrylate was conjugated to
the copolymer to bring potential targeting capability to the prodrug
in the copolymer. This polymer prodrug formed self-assembled micellar
nanoparticles in physiological conditions with an average size of
about 200 nm and a very low critical aggregation concentration of
0.011 mg/mL. The low value of cac should provide stability against
dilution if the polymer prodrug is injected in blood stream. On irradiation
by UV or laser light, Cbl molecules detached from the polymer backbone,
causing release of Cbl and disruption of the spherical nanoparticles.
The nanoparticles were further utilized to encapsulate a second anticancer
drug, DOX. The DOX-loaded prodrug nanoparticles showed controlled
release of both DOX and Cbl on irradiation with UV and laser light.
The nontoxic nature of the precursor polymer and the polymer prodrug,
along with the toxic nature of the DOX-loaded prodrug nanoparticles
toward cancer cells, especially on irradiation, established the potential
of the prodrug as a drug delivery vehicle. This was further supported
by the better cellular internalization capability of DOX-loaded nanoparticles
in cancer cells, possibly due to the presence of cancer cell targeting
biotin molecules in the polymer. Thus, this Cbl and biotin conjugated
poly(NIPA)-b-poly(HMNPPA)-b-poly(PEGMA-stat-BA) prodrug may potentially be used for the delivery
of single or multiple drugs preferentially to cancer cells on irradiation
with either soft UV or laser light.

Experimental Section
Materials
3-Bromo-1-propanol, 5-hydroxy-2-nitro benzyl
alcohol, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA), poly(ethylene
glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMA, Mw = 480), Cbl, and AIBN were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
as received. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was procured from Sigma-Aldrich
and neutralized by a standard method. All other chemicals and solvents
were purchased from local suppliers and purified by standard procedures.
3-(Benzylthiocarbonothioyl-thio)propanoic acid (BCTPA) was synthesized
according to the literature procedure.40 The procedure for synthesis of 3-bromopropyl acrylate is described
in the Supporting Information. 3-(3-Hydroxy
methyl-4-nitrophenoxy)propyl acrylate (HMNPPA) was synthesized by
following a process described below.

Synthesis of 3-(3-(Hydroxymethyl)-4-nitrophenoxy)propyl
Acrylate
(HMNPPA) (Scheme 1)
4-Hydroxy-2-nitrobenzyl alcohol (0.7 g, 4.14 mmol) and K2CO3 (1.144 g, 8.28 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of dry
DMF in a 50 mL two necked round bottomed flask under a N2 atmosphere at 70 °C. After 45 min, 3-bromopropyl acrylate dissolved
in 5 mL of dry DMF was added slowly to the solution. Then, the reaction
mixture was allowed to stir for 2 days at 70 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was extracted with DCM and washed
repeatedly with ice cold water. The crude product was purified by
column chromatography of silica gel using DCM and 1% MeOH in DCM as
mobile phase. A yellow solid was formed after evaporation of solvent.
The yield obtained was 58%. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) (Figure 1): δ (ppm) 2.15–2.08 (m, 2H), 4.23–4.12

Synthesis of Poly(NIPA)-block-poly(HMNPPA)
Copolymer (P1) (Scheme 2)
Among the different polymerization techniques
employed for the synthesis of block copolymers, RAFT polymerization
is perhaps the most suitable, due to its pertinence to various monomers
in both aqueous and organic different solvents.41−43 RAFT polymerization
was utilized to synthesize the block copolymers in the present work.
The process of synthesis of PNIPA macroCTA, P0, is provided
in the Supporting Information. Synthesis
of P1 was carried out by polymerization of HMNPPA using P0 as CTA and AIBN as radical initiator. P0 (0.3
g, 0.0467 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of 1,4 dioxane in a 25 mL round
bottomed flask; AIBN (0.0023 g, 0.014 mmol) was added to it, followed
by addition of HMNPPA (0.197 g, 0.7005 mmol). The mixture was degassed
and allowed to stir overnight at 65 °C. Thereafter, the reaction
was quenched by placing the flask inside a freezer, and the product
was isolated by precipitation twice into cold ether and dried in vacuum. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) (Figure 3): δ (ppm) 1.13 (br, CH(CH3)2 of NIPA), 1.62 (br, CHCH2 polymer back bone),

Synthesis of Biotin Acrylate (BA)
Biotin acrylate was
also synthesized in a similar way to HMNPPA. d-Biotin (0.3
g, 1.23 mmol) and K2CO3 (0.34 g, 2.45 mmol)
were put in a 50 mL two necked round bottomed flask, dissolved in
3 mL of dry DMF, and allowed to stir for 45 min at 70 °C under
a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, 3-bromopropyl acrylate (0.237 g, 1.23
mmol) dissolved in 3 mL of dry DMF was slowly added to the reaction
mixture and allowed to stir for 48 h in the same condition. The crude
product was extracted with DCM and washed with ice cold water eight
times. The combined DCM layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated. A pure product (0.315 g, 74.9%) as an off white
solid was found after recrystallization from ether. 1H

Scheme 4 Synthetic Route to
Poly(NIPA)-b-poly(HMNPPACbl)-b-poly(PEGMA-stat-BA) Copolymer (P3)
Methods
Polymer Characterization
1H NMR and 13C NMR were recorded using a
Bruker DPX spectrometer operating
at 400/600 and 100 MHz, respectively, at 25 °C in CDCl3/DMSO-d6 and were calibrated using TMS
as the internal standard. The absolute molecular weight and polydispersity
index (PDI) of the polymers were determined by a triple detector GPC
(TDAmax, Malvern, U.K.) instrument using refractive index, differential
pressure viscometry, and dual angle light scattering (λ = 670
nm, 90 and 7°) detectors, an Agilent 1200 model isocratic pump,
and THF as eluent with a flow rate of 1 mL min–1. The light scattering detectors were calibrated using narrow disperse
polystyrene standards using. dn/dc values of the polymers were determined by using a differential refractometer
(WGE DrBures, Germany).

Size Determination
Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) measurements
were performed for the determination of hydrodynamic size and size
distribution using Malvern Zetasizer Nano equipment with a temperature-controlled
sample chamber by employing a 4.0 mW He–Ne laser operated at
632.8 nm. Analysis was performed at an angle of 173°. The raw
data was processed by instrumental software to obtain the hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) and size distribution in
terms of polydispersity index (PDI). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) measurements were performed for structural analysis of polymeric
aggregates using a JEOL model JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope
at an operating voltage 80 kV.

Absorbance and Fluorescence
Measurements
The UV–vis
absorbance was recorded using a Shimadzu (model number, UV-2450) spectrophotometer.
Steady-state fluorescence spectra were collected using a Hitachi (model
no. F-7000) and Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter using
a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. HPLC measurements of the UV-irradiated P3 were carried out using acetonitrile as mobile phase at
a flow rate of 1 mL/min (detection: UV 250 nm).

Determination
of Critical Aggregation Concentration
Critical aggregation
concentration of the block copolymer P3 was determined
by using Nile Red as fluorescence probe.44 A definite amount (5 μL) of stock solution
of Nile Red in ethanol (1 mg/mL, 0.0031 mM) was added in different
vials, which was followed by evaporation of the solvent. Varying amounts
of polymer stock solution (0–0.07 mg/mL) in ethanol were added
to each of these vials and the solvent was again evaporated. Thereafter,
1 mL of PBS buffer solution was added to each of these vials, sonicated
for 5 min, and the mixtures were allowed to stir overnight at room
temperature. The emission spectra of the resulting solutions were
measured at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm while emission was
recorded from 570 to 750 nm at 37 °C. Emission intensity at 626
nm was plotted against polymer concentration to determine the critical
aggregation concentration.

Preparation of Drug-Loaded Micelle (P3–DOX)
Anticancer drug doxorubicin was loaded
into the polymeric micelles
by a simple dialysis method. To a solution of 5 mg of P3 in 1 mL of THF, 2 mg of DOX·HCl with 2 equiv of Et3N was added and allowed to stir for 1 h. Then, the solution was slowly
added to PBS buffer (10 mL) and kept overnight in the dark under stirring.
The solution was then dialyzed against buffer through a 12 000
Da molecular weight cut-off membrane for 12 h to eliminate free drug
and THF. In the meantime, the dialysis medium was changed four times.
The drug-loaded micelle solution was diluted to make the solution
concentration of polymer ∼0.3 mg/mL. The drug loading capacity
(DLC) and drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) were calculated by the
following equations.    

Phototriggered Destabilization of P3 Micelles with
and without DOX
The size and size distribution of P3 micelles with and without DOX were determined by DLS measurement.
Transmission electron microscopy measurements were also performed
for P3 micelles with and without DOX and the obtained
images were compared with the TEM image of DOX-loaded P3 micelles (P3–DOX) after 1 h of photoirradiation.
The used light sources for photoirradiation were UV light (≥365
nm, 125 mW cm–2 medium-pressure Hg lamp) and laser
(=405 nm and 110 mW cm–2).

In Vitro Drug Release Study
In vitro drug release was
studied in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Micellar solutions of P3 prodrug with and without DOX were prepared at a concentration
of ∼0.3 mg/mL (10 mL) for the investigation of phototriggered
drug release. After a certain time interval of UV light (λ ≥
365 nm) or laser (λ = 405 nm) irradiation, the aliquot (1 mL)
was taken out and analyzed by UV spectroscopy and fluorescence emission
spectroscopy. For further confirmation of drug release from P3 nanoparticles, we performed HPLC. P3 (10 mg)
was dissolved in acetonitrile (50 mL) and degassed with nitrogen.
Then, half of the solution was irradiated under UV light (λ
≥ 365 nm). Aliquots (1 mL each) were taken out after certain
time intervals and were analyzed by HPLC.

MTT Assay
The
human triple negative breast cancer cell
line MDA MB 231 and normal immortalized human dermal fibroblast cell
line (hFB) were employed for the determination of cytotoxicity of P2, P3, and P3–DOX (with
and without UV radiation) along with free DOX using MTT assay. Both
cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates at a concentration of 1 ×
106 cells per well with 100 μL of Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The
cells were then allowed to adhere to the surface of the wells in a
5% CO2 atmosphere and at 37 °C till the cells reached
70% confluency in 24 h. Then, the medium was replaced with the same
volume of DMEM with different concentrations of P2, P3, and P3–DOX (in duplicate). After treatment
with different formulations of the above-mentioned compounds, the
cells were allowed to grow for another 24 h. To observe the UV responsive
effect on DOX-loaded P3 on the cancerous cells, one of
the two P3–DOX-treated MDA MB 231 cells were UV
radiated at ≥365 nm for 15 min and placed back in the same
cell culture environment. After elapse of a predefined time, the wells
were treated with 100 μL of MTT solution and were allowed to
incubate for 4 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The formazon
crystals formed after the MTT treatment were dissolved with dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The used medium after MTT treatment was replaced
by 100 μL of DMSO. The absorbance was measured by a BioRad iMARK
microplate reader at 595 nm. The cell viability of the samples was
appraised as (Asample/Acontrol) × 100.

Cell Uptake Study
For the cellular uptake study, MDA
MB 231 cells were cultured in DMEM at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2, and the uptake was monitored under confocal
microscopy (Olympus Fluoview FU1000). For microscopic study, cells
were seeded at 0.5 × 105 cells per well and allowed
to adhere to the surface of the well overnight. The cells were treated
with free DOX and P3–DOX at time intervals of
1, 2, and 4 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min.
Then, the fixed cells were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylpndole,
dihydrochloride) for 5 min to observe the nuclei of the cells. The
cells were mounted and observed under a confocal microscope. DOX was
similarly monitored under a confocal microscope.
