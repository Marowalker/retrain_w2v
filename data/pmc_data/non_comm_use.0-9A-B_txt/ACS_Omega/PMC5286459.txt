The
first demonstration of an n-type water-gated organic field-effect
transistor (WGOFET) is here reported, along with simple water-gated
complementary integrated circuits, in the form of inverting logic
gates. For the n-type WGOFET active layer, high-electron-affinity
organic semiconductors, including naphthalene diimide co-polymers
and a soluble fullerene derivative, have been compared, with the latter
enabling a high electric double layer capacitance in the range of
1 μF cm–2 in full accumulation and a mobility–capacitance
product of 7 × 10–3 μF/V s. Short-term
stability measurements indicate promising cycling robustness, despite
operating the device in an environment typically considered harsh,
especially for electron-transporting organic molecules. This work
paves the way toward advanced circuitry design for signal conditioning
and actuation in an aqueous environment and opens new perspectives
in the implementation of active bio-organic interfaces for biosensing
and neuromodulation.

1 Introduction
Organic
semiconductors have
been widely adopted for flexible and large-area micro- and opto-electronics
applications1−8 and are also emerging as ideal materials for several biomedical
uses, from wearable healthcare devices to applications in neuroscience
and biotechnology, including: biosensors; actuators; devices for efficient,
sensitive, and reliable neural stimulation, and/or recording.9−15 Electrochemical detectors, as well as field-effect transistors,
and photodetectors were successfully integrated into living systems,9,14,16−21 both in vitro and in vivo, being able to establish functional interconnections
between electronic and ionic conduction.

Following a route similar
to that for the fast growth and success
of more conventional electronics, the development of organic biointerfaces
would experience a strong expansion of possibilities and further opportunities
with the realization of logic and analog circuits. Several applications
can be envisaged, from drug delivery to neuromodulation and from control
of intracellular calcium waves to highly sensitive biosensing and
spatially and temporally resolved release of biochemicals for controlled
cell growth and differentiation.22,23

There
have been mainly two approaches to biointerfaced circuits,
a purely ionic approach and a mixed ionic/electronic one. The former
adapts to and integrates the ionic nature of biological signal transduction
and aims at the development of devices relying on the control of ion
density and motion. Interesting and widely demonstrated examples are:
nanofluidic devices; field-effect ion transistors;24,25 and ionic, bipolar junction transistors, showing the ability to
modulate the transport of both cations and anions under physiological
conditions.26,27

An alternative approach
is ionic gating of an electronic channel,9,14,28−30 which has also been
considered a general strategy for the reduction of the operative voltage
of an organic field-effect transistor (OFET).31 Such a device actually inherits and benefits from at least two decades
of development toward the improvement of the electronic and transport
properties of organic semiconductors and can interface with the biological
world through liquid ion gating in an aqueous environment.25 Therefore, it potentially represents an ideal
hybrid system that bridges biology and electronics. The development
of water-gated organic field-effect transistors (WGOFETs)32 is a natural step toward such technology. WGOFETs
combine: the use of water (or, more generally, saline aqueous solutions)
as the gating medium; a very low operating voltage, typically in the
range of 1 V; and recently developed high-mobility printable small
molecules or polymers, which may enable cost-effective fabrication
of integrated biosensors and bioactuators in the future. The low voltage
is made possible by the high capacitance arising at the water/organic
semiconductor interface, as a consequence of the electric double layer
(EDL) generated by mobile ions in the electrolyte and charge carriers
within the organic transistor channel.33−35 Several organic semiconductors,
evaporated small molecule thin films, single crystals, and solution-processed
semiconducting polymers have been recently tested as active materials
for the realization of WGOFETs in different configurations,25,32,36−42 showing promising properties in terms of electronic conduction,
biocompatibility, easiness of processability, and environmental and
electrochemical stabilities. The common feature among most of the
semiconductors adopted so far in the literature for WGOFETs is that
they are good hole-transporting materials, enabling so-called “p-type”
devices. The critical aspects that are now under study and still represent
a challenge for such devices are the control of parameters and stability
issues.42 These same criticalities have
probably frustrated so far any convincing attempt to demonstrate n-type
WGOFETs by employing electron-transporting organic semiconductors,
apart from cases in which a pretreatment of the semiconductor surface
with acetonitrile allows for latent observation of n-type functionality.38 Yet, the demonstration of n-type WGOFETs would
enable more robust, complementary logic requiring less power to be
operated43 and a greatly expanded opportunity
for the design of analog circuitry for signal processing and amplification.

In this work, we investigate the possibility of fabricating water-gated
transistors with solution-processable electron-transporting semiconductors
and report the demonstration of an n-type polymer FET that is gated
only through the use of water, in the absence of any interfacial treatment.
We report WGOFETs based on three different electron-transporting semiconductors,
namely, poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bisthiophene)} (PNDIT2),44 poly[(E)-2,7-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-4-methyl-9-(5-(2-(5-methylselenophen-2-yl)vinyl)selenophen-2
yl)benzo[lmn][3,8] phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone] (PNDISVS),45 and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).46,47 Quite surprisingly, according to the current understanding, all
employed n-type materials permit operation of water-gated devices
at a low voltage, with width-normalized currents in the range of 3–55
pA/μm at 0.8 V, and, combined with suitable p-type WGOFETs,
enable the realization of water-gated complementary inverting logic
gates. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals the possibility
of formation of a high-capacitance EDL only in the case of PCBM, whereas
a much lower capacitance is observed in the case of PNDIT2 and PNDISVS,
owing to partial degradation of the transport properties, triggered
by contact with water, thus rationalizing the higher currents registered
in PCBM devices despite the lower charge mobility. Demonstration of
just marginal degradation over 1 h of continuous operation under water
exposure indicates a reasonably promising future for n-type WGOFETs
and their integration into robust biointerfaced logic circuits and
sensors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication
and Characterization of n-Type
WGOFETs and Complementary Logic Gates
Figure 1a depicts the configuration employed for
the realization of WGOFETs.32 We adopt
a bottom-contact, top-gate geometry, realized by patterning with photolithography
Source and Drain electrodes (channel width W = 20 000
μm, channel length L = 20 μm) on glass
and by depositing the electron-transporting semiconductors by spin-coating
from solution. A drop of water is then cast on the semiconductor surface,
and a tungsten probe works as a gate electrode. When a positive voltage
is applied between the gate and the electrodes, ions present in the
water droplet start migrating: anions are accumulated toward the gate
and cation, toward the semiconductor. This should electrostatically
induce accumulation of electrons in the semiconductor, at the semiconductor/water
interface, forming a Helmholtz double layer.33−35 As the two
oppositely charged layers at this interface are very close, with the
typical thickness of the double layers being in the range of a few
angstrom in electrolytes, a large capacitive coupling arises, enabling
operation of the transistor at a very low bias (generally, VGS < 1 V). It is worth noting that such a
gating mechanism can also be achieved starting from highly resistive,
purified water, as in this work. Indeed, due to air-exposure and handling,
the resistivity of water drops by orders of magnitude as an effect
of rapid contamination by carbon dioxide from the air, which leads
to rapid production of HCO3–. In our
case, we adopted ultrapure (Milli-Q, Millipore) water, characterized
by a nominal resistivity of 10 MΩ cm at 25 °C. This resistivity decreases
to hundreds of kΩ cm upon contamination. We can expect that
in the case of p- and n-gating HCO3– and H+ ions, respectively, will migrate
toward the interface with the organic semiconductor, thus contributing
to the formation of the EDL. Other ionic species may be active, and
the local polarization induced by the aqueous environment may also
facilitate the migration process.48 However,
a detailed analysis is beyond the goal of the present work.

of the n-channel WGOFET architecture; (b) molecular
structures of the n-type semiconductors employed as active phases
in WGOFETs, namely, PNDIT2, PNDISVS, and PCBM; (c) transfer characteristics
of the n-channel WGOFETs made with PNDIT2, PNDISVS, and PCBM; all
curves are taken at VDS = 0.8 V; source-to-gate
leakage currents (IGS) are also reported.

The chemical structures of the
n-type semiconductors investigated
in this work are shown in Figure 1b. The semiconductors were chosen because of their
relatively low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.
PNDIT2 and PNDISVS are two naphthalene diimide-based donor–acceptor
co-polymers featuring a bithiophene and selenophene–vinylene–selenophene
donor moiety, respectively. They have LUMO levels at −3.91
and −3.98 eV, respectively, owing to the high electron affinity
of the NDI unit,49 and both are known to
yield electron mobilities higher than 1 cm2/V s in solid-state
(SS) field-effect devices.5,45 PCBM is a soluble fullerene
derivative, often used as an electron acceptor for bulk heterojunction
organic solar cells,50−53 yielding good electron mobilities in conventional SS OFETs, in the
0.01–0.21 cm2/V s range,54−57 and showing a similar LUMO level
to that of NDI-based materials (∼−4.0 eV).58 The stability of the adopted
semiconductors in water and/or oxygen, clearly relevant for the development
of WGOFETs, has been partially addressed in the literature,59−63 and different degradation pathways, involving both oxygen and water
molecules, have been identified. However, on the basis of the available
environmental stability data, it is not
yet trivial to predict whether such semiconductors can work in n-type
WGOFETs, in which the active layer is in direct contact with liquid
water. We verified that it is possible to record n-type field-effect
behavior in all cases, as demonstrated by transfer curves for WGOFETs
(Figure 1c). A clear
modulation of the source-to-drain current (IDS) can be observed in all WGOFETs using a low positive VGS. All curves display similar and relatively
high leakage currents through the water drop (IGS values up to 0.05 μA at VGS = 1 V); however, for VGS > 0.5 V, IDS is higher than IGS in all cases, thus allowing to reveal a genuine field effect in
our water-gated devices. The highest IDS values are measured in PCBM WGOFETs (1.1 μA already at VGS = 0.8 V); slightly lower current values are
measured in PNDISVS (0.3 μA at VGS = 0.8 V), which however displays a higher threshold voltage, VTh, of 0.49 V, compared to 0.18 V for the PCBM
device. The lowest currents are shown by the PNDIT2 device, with 0.06
μA at VGS = 0.8 V and VTh = 0.17 V. Devices based on PCBM and PNDIT2 display
similar Ion/Ioff values of ∼103, one order of magnitude superior
to those for PNDISVS-based devices, mostly in virtue of the early
onset with respect to that for PNDISVS. Importantly, for the following
interpretation of the data, at VGS = VDS = 0.8 V (with VDS being the bias applied between the source and drain electrodes during
operation), all WGOFETs are well into the accumulation regime, beyond
the subthreshold, as evidenced by the good linear fitting of IDS1/2 versus VGS.64

The demonstrated possibility
of realizing n-type WGOFETs enables
the realization of electrical circuits integrating both n- and p-type
transistors. As a first proof-of-concept of an integrated complementary
organic circuit gated through water, we fabricated complementary inverters
(Figure 2a),65 using well-established p-type WGOFETs, based
alternatively on (poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)) (pBTTT) or (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl))
(P3HT).32,41 To fabricate the integrated inverters, the
two semiconductor layers are deposited from solution and patterned
on interdigitated channels, one next to the other, using a photolithographic
method developed by Chang et al.66 In Figure 2b, a picture of a
typical device is shown: the p-type (in figure pBTTT) and n-type (in
figure PNDIT2) layers are, respectively, visible in the same substrate
as active layers of the two interconnected transistors. A drop of
water is employed as the gating medium and is common to both transistors.
A tungsten tip (radius 300 μm) serves as an input node of input
voltage Vin and is immersed in the water
drop at approximately the same distance from both transistors and
at ∼1 mm from the active material surface. Using this approach,
we have realized various inverters combining different p- and n-type
WGOFETs. The output characteristics of the single devices in the inverters
and the voltage-transfer characteristics (VTC) of the inverter are
plotted in Figure 2. The combination of PNDIT2 and pBTTT (L = 40 μm
and W = 20 000 μm) produces an inversion
threshold, Vinv, of 0.28 V (calculated
as the intercept between the bisecting line of the quadrant corresponding
to Vin values from 0 to 1 and the inverter
curve), thus shifted to lower values with respect to the ideal value
corresponding to half of the supply voltage (VDD/2) (Figure 2c–e). The shifted transition between the two logic states
is attributed to the mismatch between n- and p-type transistors, originating
from the differences in mobility, capacitance, and threshold voltages.
It is possible to observe hysteresis between the forward (inversion
from logic states “1” to “0”) and backward
(from “0” to “1”) scans. On quantifying
it by considering the difference Vin,forward – Vin,backward at Vout = VDD, a value of 0.29
V is obtained. The gain of the inverter, a significant parameter for
establishing the quality of the device, extracted as the slope in
the transition region (Vinv) of the VTC,
is about ∼2 (Figure S2). The combination
of PNDISVS and pBTTT (Figure 2f–h) (p-type: L = 40 μm, W = 15 000 μm; n-type: L =
5 μm, W = 20 000 μm) is characterized
by a more balanced VTC, with Vinv = 0.38
V at VDD = 0.8 V; a reduced hysteresis
of 0.18 V (compatible with the hysteretic behavior shown by the transfer
characteristics of both p- and n-type transistors, see Figure S3); and an increased gain of ∼3
at the logic transition (Figures S3 and S4). The best inverter was obtained by combining PCBM and P3HT (L = 5 μm and W = 10 000 μm)
(Figure 2i–k,
where data refer in this case to an inverter obtained by external
wiring of two WGOFETs): we have obtained Vinv = 0.39 V at VDD = 0.8 V, a limited hysteresis
of 0.07 V, and an increased gain of ∼6 (Figure S5 and S6).

Thanks to the possibility of observing
an n-type field effect for
all three electron-transporting semiconductors presented here, we
showed that it is possible to adopt a complementary design for water-gated
electronic circuits, exemplified here by the very simple case of an
inverting device, thus overcoming the strong limitations of unipolar
design toward water-gated circuits: on the one hand, more robust water-gated
logic gates can be exploited, and on the other, as most well-known
analog architectures require both n- and p-type FETs, signal-conditioning
stages, such as amplifiers operating in an aqueous environment, become
feasible.67

2.2 Investigation
of the Capacitive Coupling and
Transport Mechanism of n-Type WGOFETs
As already outlined
above, the devices show different currents (Figure 1c), and it is important to clarify the origin
of such differences. Interestingly, the WGOFET currents do not simply
reflect the mobility of the OFETs fabricated with the polymer films
under exactly the same conditions as those adopted for WGOFETs (details
of the devices and the corresponding transfer characteristics are
reported in the Supporting Information).
In fact, we have extracted a mobility in saturation, μsat, of 2.5 cm2/V s for PNDIT2, μsat = 1.9
cm2/V s for PNDISVS, and μsat = 8 ×
10–3 cm2/V s for PCBM from OFETs. Therefore,
although PCBM shows the smallest field-effect mobility among conventional
transistors, it leads to the best n-type WGOFETs reported. This observation
may imply
that the field-effect mobility in water-gated devices is drastically
different from that in conventional FETs and/or that the capacitance
of all WGOFETs is not the same and is affected by the specific nature
of the semiconductor. The latter has been previously observed, for
example, in p-type WGOFETs, in which it was shown that the capacitance
induced by the Helmholtz double layer thickness can have sensible
contributions from the polymer structure (side chains) and/or microstructural
features at the interface with water.42 Moreover, in the case of n-type materials that are typically subjected
to oxygen/water-induced operational instabilities, the effectiveness
of the charge-accumulation process could have been compromised by
the direct contact with water.

From the WGOFET transfer characteristic
curves, we first extract the capacitance–mobility product in
the saturation regime, C·μsat, a safely extracted figure of merit, accounting also for the efficiency
of the channel accumulation process. We have extracted C·μsat values of 3 × 10–4,
2.5 × 10–3, and 7 × 10–3 μF V–1s–1 for PNDIT2,
PNDISVS, and PCBM, respectively. For comparison, the same quantities
extracted for conventional OFETs (see Table 1) are as follows: 1.45 × 10–2, 1.1 × 10–2, and 4.6 × 10–5 μF V–1s–1 for PNDIT2,
PNDISVS, and PCBM, respectively. Evidently, only PCBM-based WGOFETs
congruently benefit from the high capacitance of the water-gating
process, resulting in values of C·μsat that are 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in conventional
OFETs, characterized by a low capacitance of 5.8 nF cm–2. Conversely, NDI polymer-based WGOFETs show C·μsat values that are even lower than those for the
corresponding conventional OFETs, in agreement with a scenario of
water-induced degradation of accumulation and/or transport properties.
To solve this discrepancy, we performed EIS measurements to extract
the capacitance values at the water–semiconductor interface
for the three cases. Electrochemical characterization was carried
out on Au/water/polymer/Au capacitor structures by means of a potentiostat,
in a two-electrode configuration (polymer/gold interface area ∼5
mm2; gold counter-electrode area ∼9 cm2). Capacitances values were extracted from impedance measurements
according to an equivalent RC frequency-dependent circuit (Figure S8a), in which the Helmholtz double layer
capacitance is considered to be well approximated by C(ω) in the low-frequency range. Figure 3a shows the extracted capacitances as a function
of frequency at gate voltages of 0.4 V, for which the accumulation
regime is achieved. Bode plots are reported in the SI (Figure S9).

and PCBM films within

a Note that C represents
the capacitance values as extracted from EIS measurements at 0.1 Hz
(in agreement with the slow VGS sweep
rate applied during transfer curve acquisition); as commented in the
text, in the case of semiconductor degradation, this C value does not coincide with the capacitance responsible for the
field effect within the channel.

b Corresponding to the geometrical
capacitance of the semiconducting film (0.068 and 0.123 μF cm–2 for PNDIT2 and PNDISVS, respectively).

c Apparent values, extracted by approximating
the active area to the one defined by the source and drain pattern
(W, L).

The capacitance values at low frequencies, before
the cutoff (<100
Hz), are remarkably higher for the case of PCBM, reaching almost 1
μF cm–2 at 0.1 Hz. This value is of the same
order of magnitude of that recorded in other p-type WGOFETs.32,40,42,68 It can be observed that the capacitance of PCBM increases for frequency
values lower than 1 Hz (Figure 3a), strongly suggesting transition to a different charge-accumulation
mechanism, enabled by slower bias modulation. Ion migration through
PCBM films, with the formation of a volumetric capacitance and therefore
an extended gated volume, may likely account for such behavior;69 a detailed understanding of the charge-accumulation
mechanism in PCBM/water interfaces would require deep investigations,
which are out of the scope of this work. If we use the EIS extracted
capacitance at 0.1 Hz from the C·μsat parameter of the PCBM WGOFET, we estimate a μsat of 0.007 cm2/V s, a value that is strongly consistent
with the conventional OFET mobility (0.008 cm2/V s). This
demonstrates that no evident degradation owing to the direct contact
with water precludes the electron accumulation and transport mechanism
in water-gated PCBM in the whole channel area.

Conversely, in
the case of NDI-based polymers, much lower capacitance
values are recorded, approximately 120 and 75 nF cm–2 (at 1 Hz) for PNDISVS and PNDIT2, respectively. These values are
not in agreement with the formation of an EDL over the whole channel
area and are instead very close to the geometrical capacitance (Cg) of the polymer layer considered as a perfect
dielectric: from the thicknesses of the semiconducting layers (25
nm for PNDIT2 and 45 nm for PNDISVS), we estimated capacitances of
123 and 68 nF cm–2 for PNDIT2 and PNDISVS, respectively
(assuming εr = 3.5).70,71 However, if
no charge at all could be accumulated in the semiconductor, as the
capacitance measurements seem to imply, we would obviously not be
able to record any field-effect current in these devices. As a matter
of fact, because both the NDI co-polymers show working WGOFETs (Figure 1c), electrons must,
first, be able to accumulate in the semiconductor with a capacitance
high enough to operate at |VGS| < 1
V and, further, to be transported through the channel. This can only
be possible if, following a partial degradation process precluding
the accumulation of charges on most of the device width, some limited
areas, negligible with respect to the total area, hence almost not
recordable with EIS measurements, are actually active. Such a degradation
mechanism might be related to the trapping of accumulated carriers,
which occupy deep electronic states and cannot move under the oscillating
field of the impedance measurement. Such scenario is schematically
depicted in Figure 3b: within the matrix of a degraded polymer, mostly impeding charge
injection and accumulation, few conducting paths exist, forming a
much lower effective channel width compared to that geometrically
defined by the source and drain pattern. Accordingly, the estimated
values of C·μsat are just apparent values and are largely underestimated.

It
is quite surprising that despite the strong degradation (not
more than 10% of the channel is likely preserved) charge percolation
is still possible along the 20 μm long channels of the WGOFETs.
We can speculate that the high level of interconnectivity of the polymer,
as recently reported for PNDIT2,72 along
with the demonstration that long-range crystalline order extended
along the channel is not necessary to provide effective charge percolation,73 may be at the origin of the preservation of
charge percolation paths even in the case of strong degradation.

It is worth mentioning that a 1 order of magnitude of difference
in C·μsat is
observed between PNDIT2 and PNDISVS, possibly owing to the superior
stability of PNDISVS.45Although
on the basis of the estimated energetic levels of the two polymers
electrochemical reactions of H2O molecules and/or hydrated
oxygen with the neutral and charged conjugated segments should be
similarly favored, it is possible that the improved performance of
PNDISVS derives from a more effective self-insulation of the backbones
from a combination of effects related to side chains (C8C10 for PNDIT2
vs C10C12 for PNDISVS) and micro- and meso-structural features (with
evidence of superior crystallinity in PNDISVS films45), as the different packings can act as a kinetic barrier
against penetration of aqueous reactive species into the film.74,75

2.3 Stability of PCBM-Based WGOFETs
Having
analyzed the origin of the better performance of the PCBM WGOFETs,
we performed tests to first assess the stability of operation of the
devices while gated through water (p-type polymer stability has already
been established elsewhere39,76). In Figure 4a, the continuous cycling voltage
test of PCBM WGOFETs is reported; we performed 100 cycles by switching
the device on (VGS = 0.8 V) and off (VGS = −0.2 V), with a duration of 9 s/cycle
(total test duration 15 min). In the first 15 cycles of the test,
no evidence of degradation was observed; after the first 15 cycles,
a gradual decrease in the on current was observed,
also accompanied by an increase in the off current.
After 85 cycles a reduction of 10% in the on current
and on/off reduction from 744 to 620 is registered,
providing proof of a promising, yet limited so far, robustness of
the device to operation in contact with water.

Figure 4 (a) Continuous cycling
voltage test of PCBM WGOFETs at VDS = VGS = 0.8 V;
the duration of each cycle was 9 s, and the test was carried out for
a total time of 15 min; (b) PCBM shelf-life test: transfer characteristics
(VDS = 0.8 V) at different times of exposure
to air-free water, for a total exposure time of 55 min.

We have also tested shelf-life stability, by maintaining
PCBM continuously
in contact with water and measuring the transfer curve of the device
just after depositing the droplet and after 3, 9, and 55 min (Figure 4b). After 3 min,
we recorded a marked threshold voltage shift toward lower voltages.
The curve recorded after 9 min is identical to the one recorded after
3 min. After 55 min, only a modification in the subthreshold region
was recorded, whereas the current on full accumulation was almost
unmodified. The off current increase registered in
the cycling test is thus due to a shift in the threshold voltage,
solely induced by the prolonged exposure to water, as observed in
the shelf-life stability test, and is not triggered by the charge-accumulation
process; on the other hand, the shelf-life stability test does not
evidence any on current drop over a time of exposure
4 times longer than that during the cycling test, suggesting that
simple exposure of the PCBM surface does not affect the electron mobility
within the film and that the 10% reduction in the on current in the cycling test is mostly due to electrical stress factors.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have reported
the first demonstration of n-type
transistors gated through water using low-lying LUMO-level organic
semiconductors, that is, two NDI-based co-polymers and the fullerene
derivative PCBM. In particular, PCBM-based WGOFETs preserve full functionality,
displaying high capacitance values approaching 1 μF/cm2 and mobility values totally comparable to those of solid-state standard
devices. As a proof of concept, we realized water-gated inverters,
using as the counterpart of n-type WGOFETs the well-established p-type
WGOFETs based on PBTTT and P3HT, resulting in well-balanced low voltage
inversion and gain values of up to 6. This work demonstrates the possibility
of realizing a water-gated, complementary circuit design based on
organic semiconductors. Reasonable, short-term stability of water-gated
n-type devices was also reported, a key and most critical aspect for
the future development of any real application. Although embryonic
and still requiring extension to physiological solutions, the reported
results open new perspectives in the realization of complex circuits
for signal conditioning and actuation at the interface between biological
matter and organic electronics.a

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
PNDIT2 was purchased from
Polyera Corporation (Activink N2200) and PCBM, from Nano-C. PNDISVS
was synthesized by following the previously reported procedure.45 P3HT was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
and pBTTT, from Ossila Ltd. (Sheffield, UK). The purchased materials
were used without any further purification. Water was purified with
a Milli-Q water system (Millipore). Purified water shows a resistivity
of 10 MΩ cm just after purification, which decreases to hundreds
of kΩ cm because of handling, due to the well-known process
of contamination by carbon dioxide from air, which leads to the rapid
production of HCO3–.

4.2 Samples Preparation
For both WGOFETs
and SS OFETs, we adopted a bottom-contact architecture. Thoroughly
cleaned 1737F glass was used as the substrate. Interdigitated Au contacts
were defined by a lift-off photolithographic process, with a 0.7 nm
thick Cr adhesion layer. The thickness of the Au contacts was 30 nm.
The substrates were cleaned in a sonic bath in isopropyl alcohol for
2–3 min before deposition of the semiconductor.

PNDIT2
was dissolved in toluene (5 g/L), and the obtained solution was deposited
by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 30 s in air. In this way, 45 nm thick
PNDIT2 films were obtained and finally annealed at 120 °C for
10 min to remove residual solvent. PNDISVS was dissolved in chlorobenzene
(12 g/L), and the obtained solution was deposited by spin-coating
at 2000 rpm for 60 s in air. In this way, 25 nm thick PNDISVS films
were obtained and finally annealed at 280 °C for 10 min to remove
residual solvent and improve the structural order; they were then
cooled slowly to ambient temperature. PCBM was dissolved in chlorobenzene
(20 g/L), and the obtained solution was deposited by spin-coating
at 1500 rpm for 1 min in a nitrogen glovebox. PCBM films (thickness
55 nm) were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to remove residual
solvent and improve the structural order; they were then cooled slowly
to ambient temperature. The P3HT solution was prepared by dissolving
P3HT in chloroform at a concentration of 3 g/L. pBTTT was dissolved
in a solution of anhydrous dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 5
g/L on a hotplate at 100 °C. The solutions were filtered with
a 0.2 lm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filter before spin-coating.

Concerning SS OFETs, in the case of PNDIT2 and PNDISVS, PMMA (Sigma–Aldrich)
was spun from n-butylacetate (80 g/L, filtered with
a 0.45 μm PTFE filter) at 1300 rpm for 60 s. Dielectric-layer
thicknesses of ≈550 nm were obtained. In the case of PCBM,
the perfluorinated polymer CYTOP CTL-809M dielectric (Asahi Glass)
was spun as received at 6000 rpm for 90 s (film thickness, 550 nm)
as the dielectric layer.

After dielectric deposition, the devices
were annealed under nitrogen,
on a hotplate, at 120 °C for 14 h. Gate Al electrodes
(30 nm thick) were thermally evaporated as gate contacts.

4.3 Characterization
EIS and cyclic voltammetry
were performed on a Au/water/OSC/Au structure. The measurements were
performed with a potentiostat (Metrohm Autolab PGstat 302N) working
in a two-electrode configuration. The first working electrode has
a contact area for the OSC/Au interface that is much smaller (5 mm2) than the area of the second Au counter-electrode (9 cm2), to avoid the contribution of the latter in the measured
complex impedance. Data analyses were performed using Nova 1.8 software.
The impedance spectra were recorded in the 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz frequency
range by applying a VAC = 0.02 V (root-mean-square
value) sine-wave voltage signal. A 0.4 V continuous bias (DC signal,
referred to as the gold counter-electrode) was superposed to the AC
signal. For the details of the equivalent electrical circuit used
to fit the EIS data, please refer to the Supporting Information.

The electrical characteristics of the transistors
and inverters in this work were measured in a nitrogen glovebox on
a Wentworth Laboratories probe station with an Agilent B1500A semiconductor
device analyzer.
