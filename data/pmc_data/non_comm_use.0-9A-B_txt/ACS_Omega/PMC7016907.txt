This study is on
current developments concerning ferrocene (FC)
and its derivatives on the basis of electrochemical biosensors and
sensors. The distinct physiochemical characteristics of FC have enabled
the development of new sensor devices, specifically electrochemical
sensors. Several articles have focused on the implementation of FC
as an electrode constituent while discussing its electrochemical behavior.
Furthermore, typical FC-design-based biosensors and sensors are considered
as well as practical examples. The favorable design of FC-based biosensors
and general sensors needs adequate control of their chemical and physical
characteristics in addition to their surface immobilization and functionalization.

1 Introduction
Ferrocene was discovered
in 1951,1 and
its formation was clarified by Wilkinson et al.2 The common features of ferrocene reactivity to benzene
were the reason scientists named this novel iron sandwiched compound
ferrocene.2 Ferrocene structure disclosure
was an advancement in the field of chemistry and led to the emergence
of organometallic chemistry. Ferrocene quickly became the focus of
scientists and technical communities due to its unique chemistry.
Scientists began to develop synthetic methods based on ferrocene derivatives
and determined its use in a wide range of scientific zones.3

Air- and water-stable, ferrocene (FC) is
subjected to reversible
oxidation to FC+; hence, it is a favorable internal standard
in electrochemistry. The stability of ferrocene enables its rings
as derivatives via typical reactions in organic chemistry, providing
access to numerous organometallic compounds. In general, ferrocene
chemical and physical characteristics including its derivatives may
be applied in an extensive range of subject areas including sensing,
materials science, and catalysis.3 Herein,
the current progress in electrode modification by ferrocene is reviewed
along with its advancements in detecting various analytes. Ferrocene
as a type of metalocene exhibited metallic and nonmetallic features.
Their special electronic configuration allows them to have attractive
electrochemical properties. The unique bonding between the metallic
species (d-orbital) and nonmetallic species (π bond) provided
a smooth electronic transfer pathway, suggesting interesting sensoring
applications.

2 Ferrocene and Ferrocene Derivative
Modified
Electrodes for Biosensing Applications
The design of sensitive
and user-friendly analytical processes
to determine contaminants such as metal ions, drugs, toxins, and pesticides
is vital in environmental analysis and food safety. Traditional analytical
approaches in such an analysis are on the basis of chromatographic
methods that enable selective and sensitive detection.4a In spite of these advantages, chromatographic
methods necessitate skilled technicians for operation and are not
sufficient for screening assessment. Thus, there are continuous advancements
in expeditious and low-cost devices for environmental monitoring such
as in situ analysis. Electrochemical biosensors are typically robust
analytical tools enabling multiplexed analysis, prompt response, specificity,
and sensitivity and are cost-efficient.3

Tajik et al. incorporated a ferrocene–derivative composite,
1-(4-bromobenzyl)-4-ferrocenyl-1H-[1,2,3]-triazole
(1,4-BBFT), to create an adjusted graphene past electrode. Hydrophilic
ionic liquid (n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate)
was binded to assemble the adjusted electrode. At the modified electrode
surface, the electro-oxidation of isoproterenol was examined by using
square wave voltammetry (SWV), chronoamperometry (CHA), and cyclic
voltammetry (CV). At optimal conditions, the SWV peak current of isoproterenol
linearly increased with isoproterenol concentrations within the 6.0
× 10–8 to 7.0 × 10–4 M range and at a 12.0 nM detection limit. This modified electrode
demonstrates favorable resolution among the voltammetric peaks of
theophylline, acetaminophen, and isoproterenol, making it adequate
for isoproterenol determination with the existence of theophylline
and acetaminophen within real samples.4a

The evaluation of electrochemical activity and methyldopa
determination
was conducted by Salmanipour et al. for a carbon nanotube (CNT) adjusted
carbon paste electrode (CPE) and FC acting as an electrocatalyst.
The outcome of CV showed that the FC and CNT scheme can significantly
increase electrocatalytic behavior toward methyldopa oxidation. This
improvement led to a substantial enhancement of methyldopa anodic
peak current and enables the creation of an extremely sensitive voltammetric
sensor to detect methyldopa within real samples. At optimal conditions,
the sensor has a wider dynamic range of 0.1–500 μM at
a 0.08 ± 0.002 μM detection limit. The suggested approach
enabled the detection of methyldopa in the proximity of folic acid.5a

Beitollahi at al. synthesized Ag-ZnO nanoplates
and 2-chlorobenzoyl
ferrocene (2CBF) and applied it for glutathione electro-oxidation
at the exterior of the adjusted electrode. At optimal conditions,
the SWV peak current of glutathione linearly increased with concentrations
of glutathione with the 5.0 × 10–8 to 2.0 ×
10–4 M range with 0.659 μA μM–1 sensitivity and a 20.0 nM method detection limit. The modified electrode
demonstrated a favorable clarification among the voltammetric peaks
of tryptophan and glutathione, making it adequate to detect glutathione
with the existence of tryptophan within real samples.6a

Karimi-Maleh et al. designed a ferrocene-adjusted
carbon nanotube
paste electrode which was applied as a sensitive means of determining N-acetylcysteine at trace levels. The use of a highly conductive
carbon nanotube can significantly improve the sensitivity. It was
proven by double step chronoamperometry and direct current voltammetry
that the modified sensor is able to catalyze N-acetylcysteine
oxidation in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) which exhibits a sharp
oxidation peak current. The linear calibration range was 1.0–400.0
μM at a 0.6 μM detection limit for DPV. This modified
sensor was evaluated as a selective electrochemical sensor to determine N-acetylcysteine within real samples, e.g., urine, serum,
and drugs.5b

Similarly, Taherkhani
et al. designed a CPE chemically adjusted
using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and FC which acted as
a specific electrochemical sensor to simultaneously determine trace
quantities of folic acid and cysteamine. The modified electrode exhibited
extremely efficient electrocatalytic behavior for cysteamine anodic
oxidation. The folic acid and cysteamine peak currents of DPV linearly
increased with their concentration within the 0.7–200 μM
cysteamine and 5.0–700 μM folic acid ranges at 0.3 μM
and 2.0 μM detection limits for cysteamine and folic acid, respectively.5c

Raoof et al. fabricated a chemically adjusted
CPE with 1-[4-(ferrocenyl
ethynyl) phenyl]-1-ethanone (4-FEPEM) that was applied to examine l-cysteine electrocatalytic oxidation. At the optimal conditions
of pH = 7, l-cysteine oxidation at the electrode exterior
took place at approximately 350 mV less positive potential compared
to a bare CPE. Linear reliability on l-cysteine concentration
was shown by the catalytic oxidation peaks. Linear analytical curves
were acquired within the 9.0 × 10–5–4.9
× 10–3 M and 2.0 × 10–5–2.8 × 10–3 M ranges of l-cysteine
with 0.9981 and 0.9982 correlation coefficients in CV and DPV approaches
at 9.9 × 10–6 M and 5 × 10–6 M detection limits, correspondingly. This approach was also employed
to selectively determine l-cysteine within patient blood
plasma and several pharmaceutical arrangements via the standard addition
approach.7

Akhgar et al. reported
a CPE modified via incorporating CNT and
FC and examined in pH 7.0 PBS via the CV method. This modified electrode
demonstrated exceptional electrocatalytic impact on norepinephrine
oxidation. In PBS (pH = 7), the oxidation current was linearly enhanced
with NE concentration within the 0.47–500.0 μM range
at 0.21 μM detection limit (3σ) by DPV. This adjusted
electrode was applied to detect norepinephrine in an abundance of
tryptophan and acetaminophen via the DPV approach.5d

Esfandiari Baghbamidi fabricated a CPE adjusted with
CNT and FC.
The electrochemical examination of the adjusted electrode and a study
on its electrocatalytic oxidation efficiency for folic acid and benserazide
uric acid was conducted. The oxidation of benserazide at the modified
electrode’s surface took place at 285 mV lower potential compared
to that of an unmodified CPE. A linear dynamic range was achieved
by SWV within 8.0 × 10–7 to 7.0 × 10–4 M at 1.0 × 10–7 M detection
limit for benserazide.5e

Raoof et
al. implemented a modified CPE with 2,7-bis(ferrocenyl
ethyl)fluoren-9-one (2,7-BFEFM) to examine ascorbic acid electrocatalytic
oxidation within an aqueous mixture. At optimal conditions, i.e.,
pH = 7, ascorbic acid oxidation at the electrode exterior took place
at 300 mV less positive potential compared to a bare CPE. Catalytic
oxidation peak currents exhibited linear reliance on ascorbic acid
concentration, while linear analytical curves were achieved within
the 8.0 × 10–5–2.0 × 10–3 M and 3.1 × 10–5–3.3 × 10–3 M ranges of ascorbic acid with 0.9980 and 0.9976
correlation coefficients in CV and DPV approaches at 2.9 × 10–5 M and 9.0 × 10–6 M detection
limits. This method was also assessed to determine ascorbic acid within
pharmaceutical preparations.8a

CHA,
DPV, and CV methods were applied to examine the electrochemical
activity of ascorbic acid at chemically adjusted electrodes assembled
via the incorporation of 7-bis(ferrocenyl ethynyl) fluoren-9-one (2,7-BFEFO)
into a carbon paste matrix proposed by Raoof et al. At optimal conditions,
pH = 7, this adjusted electrode exhibited highly electrocatalytic
behavior concerning the oxidation of ascorbic acid. The overpotential
for ascorbic acid oxidation was reduced by over 200 mV, and the relevant
peak current was substantially raised. The FC/FC+ redox
couple takes the role of an adequate mediator to indirectly oxidize
ascorbic acid by taking the advantages of the 7-bis(ferrocenyl ethynyl)
fluoren-9-one (2,7-BFEFO) in a carbon paste matrix. The modified electrode’s
voltammetric reaction was linear versus ascorbic acid concentration
within the 5 × 10–5–2.65 × 10–3 M and 9 × 10–6 −3.5
× 10–3 M ranges with CV and DPV methods at
1.8 × 10–5 M and 4.2 × 10–6 M detection limits.6b

Movlaee et
al. fabricated a modified CPE using graphene (GR) and
ethyl 2-(4-ferrocenyl-[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl) acetate (EFTA) which took
the role of an electrocatalytic oxidation for levodopa. At optimal
conditions, at pH = 7, levodopa oxidation takes place at approximately
280 mV potential against Ag/AgCl via SWV that is less positive compared
to a bare CPE. This reconstructed electrode is capable of resolving
levodopa, tyrosine, and acetaminophen voltammetric peaks. Within the
levodopa concentration range of 0.2–400.0 μM, the peak
current was linear, while the analytical ranges were 1.0–150.0
μM for acetaminophen and 5.0–180.0 μM for tyrsosine.10a

Beitollahi et al. synthesized 2-chlorobenzoyl
ferrocene (2CBF)
and applied it to design an adjusted graphene oxide (GO) sheet paste
electrode. At the modified electrode surface, the electro-oxidation
of hydrochlorothiazide was examined. At optimal conditions, hydrochlorothiazide’s
SWV peak current was linearly enhanced with hydrochlorothiazide concentration
within the 5.0 × 10–8 to 2.0 × 10–4 M range at 2.0 × 10–8 M detection
limit for hydrochlorothiazide. This modified electrode displayed favorable
distinction among the voltammetric peaks of folic acid and hydrochlorothiazide,
making it adequate to detect hydrochlorothiazide with the existence
of folic acid within real samples.6c

In a study conducted by Molaakbari et al. that fabricated a CPE
adjusted with TiO2 nanoparticles and ferrocenemonocarboxylic
acid (FM), it was utilized to create an original electrochemical sensor.
The aim of modifying this electrode was to discover electrochemical
activity to detect methyldopa with the existence of folic acid and
glycine. In a PBS of pH = 7.0, the peak potentials were 325, 750,
and 880 mV vs Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.0 M) for methyldopa, folic acid, and
glycine. At optimal conditions, i.e., pH = 7, methyldopa oxidation
took place at an approximate potential of 160 mV less positive compared
to a bare CPE. The catalytic current reaction with methyldopa concentration
exhibited linear correlation within the 2.0 × 10–7–1.0 × 10–4 M range at 8.0 × 10–8 M detection limit.11

Mahmoudi Moghaddam et al. designed an adjusted carbon nanotube
paste electrode with ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (FCD) used as a selective
and sensitive voltammetric determinant for norepinephrine. The norepinephrine-mediated
oxidation at the exterior of the adjusted electrode was examined using
CV. At optimal conditions, the NE calibration curve was acquired within
the 0.03–500.0 μΜ range at a 22.0 nM detection
limit using the DPV approach. The DPV method was utilized to simultaneously
determine acetaminophen and norepinephrine at the modified electrode
in addition to quantifying them within real samples via the standard
addition method.12

2CBF was synthesized
by Forought et al. and implemented to design
an adjusted carbon nanotube paste electrode. N-Acetylcysteine
electro-oxidation at the modified electrode exterior was examined.
At optimal conditions, the N-acetylcysteine’s
SWV peak current linearly increased with N-acetylcysteine
concentration within the 5.0 × 10–8–4.0
× 10–4 M range. This adjusted electrode demonstrated
favorable distinction among the voltammetric peaks of folic acid and N-acteylcysteine, making it adequate to detect N-acetylcysteine with the existence of folic acid within real samples.6d

Mohammadi et al. designed a modified CPE
with CNT and 2CBF which
was used to examine ascorbic acid electrocatalytic oxidation in aqueous
solution using CHA, SWV, and CV. It was discovered that at optimal
conditions, i.e., pH = 7, ascorbic acid oxidation at the modified
electrode surface took place at 85 mV less positive potential compared
to that of an unmodified CPE. By implementing SWV, PBS at pH = 4.0,
the oxidation current was linearly increased with an ascorbic acid
concentration interval within the 1.0 × 10–7–7.0 × 10–5 M range at a 64.0 nM detection
limit (3σ). This approach was also assessed to determine ascorbic
acid within real samples.6e

Beitollahi
et al. designed a modified CPE with 2CBF and ZnO–CuO
for captopril electro-oxidation at the modified electrode surface.
At the optimal state, the captopril SWV peak current was linearly
enhanced with captopril concentrations within the 5.0 × 10–7–9.0 × 10–4 M range
at 90.0 nM detection limit for captopril. This modified electrode
displayed favorable distinction among the voltammetric peaks of tryptophan
and captopril, making it adequate to detect captopril with the existence
of tryptophan in real samples.6f

Beitollahi et al. conducted more research where they fabricated
a modified CPE with Ag–ZnO nanoplates and 2CBF to determine d-penicillamine with the existence of tryptophan. They recommended
an EC′ method as presented in Figure 1 to depict d-penicillamine electrochemical
oxidation at the exterior of the adjusted electrode. In this method,
oxidation of d-penicillamine occurs at the catalytic, i.e.,
C, reaction via oxidized 2CBF created at the modified electrode surface
by an electrochemical, i.e., E, response. At optimal conditions, i.e.,
pH = 7.0, d-penicillamine oxidation at the modified electrode
surface takes place at approximately 165 mV less positive potential
compared to that of an unmodified CPE. The suggested approach displayed
an extensive linear dynamic range within the 0.03–250.0 μM
range at 0.015 μM detection limit, S/N = 3. The modified sensor
was applied to determine tryptophan and d-penicillamine within
real samples.6g

acid and 6-mercaptopurine. Ultimately, this modified electrode was
implemented to determine folic acid and mercaptopurine within biological
and pharmaceutical samples.6h

In
a study conducted by Beitollahi et al., a modified CPE with
2CBF and CNT was designed and implemented for isoproterenol electro-oxidation.
At the optimal state, the SWV isoproterenol peak currents were linearly
enhanced with isoproterenol concentration within the 2.5 × 10–7–8.0 × 10–5 M range
at the 9.0 × 10–8 M detection limit for isoproterenol.6i

Mahmoudi Moghaddam et al. proposed a modified
CPE via incorporating
graphene nanosheets and a 2,7-bis(ferrocenyl ethyl)fluoren-9-one (2,7-BF).
The modified electrode demonstrated exceptional electrocatalytic impact
on epinephrine oxidation. The relevant oxidation current linearly
increased with epinephrine concentration within the 0.05–550.0
μM range at 27.0 nM detection limit (3σ) for epinephrine.
This electrode was applied for the determination of epinephrine within
an excess of folic acid and uric acid via SWV.8b

Akbari et al. used a Cu/TiO2 nanocomposite/IL/2-(ferrocenylethynyl)
fluoren-9-one (2FF) modified CPE (Cu/TiO2-IL-2FF/CPE) to
electrochemically determine levodopa. The acquired data indicated
that the levodopa electro-oxidation at the exterior of the adjusted
electrode was substantially facilitated, which was accredited to high
Cu/TiO2 nanocomposite, IL, and 2FF electrical conductivity.
Favorable electron-mediating activity was exhibited by the Cu/TiO2-IL-2FF/CPE which was followed by clearly segmented oxidation
signals of tyrosine and levodopa. The DPV peak current displayed a
linear correlation corresponding to levodopa concentrations within
a 0.03–700.0 μM linear range at a 12.0 nM detection limit.13

Mirrahimi et al. fabricated a benzoylferrocene
(BF) modified carbon
nanotube paste electrode to determine two amino acids, d-penicillamine
and tryptophan, within an aqueous mixture at pH = 7.0. The outcomes
showed that the electrode was effective in regard to electrocatalytic
behavior to oxidize d-penicillamine, causing an overpotential
decrease of over 155 mV. By employing SWV, measuring tryptophan and d-penicillamine in the form of a concoction may be conducted
independently from one another with 250 mV potential difference. The
suggested electrochemical sensor demonstrated a linear calibration
plot within a 1.0 × 10–6–8.0 ×
10–4 M range at a 1.3 × 10–7 M detection limit for d-penicillamine.14a

Soltani et al. modified a CPE with CNT and benzoylferrocene
to

no phenylephrine and guaifenesin involvement. In this regard, a CPE
was adjusted with GR and ethyl 2-(4-ferrocenyl[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl)acetate
(EFTA). This modified electrode exhibited a 0.4–500.0 μM
linear range at 0.08 μM detection limit. There were no changes
regarding the modified electrode’s sensitivity concerning methyldopa
with the existence of guaifenesin and phenylephrine, enabling independent
or simultaneous calculation of the three moieties. By determining
these substances within real samples, the effectiveness of the suggested
electrode was assessed.10b

Movlaee
et al. used GR and EFTA-adjusted CPE to determine droxidopa.
Because of the beneficial properties of the modified electrode, there
was a linear correlation among droxidopa concentration and the anodic
peak current within the 2.0–400.0 μM range at 9.0 ×

3 Ferrocene and Ferrocene Derivative Modified
Electrodes for Environment Pollutant and Pesticide Determination
Quantifying pollutant compounds, namely, phenol, sulfite, hydrazine,
and hydroxylamine, are vital for the industry. From the analytical
methods utilized for environmental, pharmaceutical, and biological
compound analysis, the electrochemical approaches are becoming prevalent
in industrial processes.

Pesticides are widely used to avoid
or limit damages stemming from
weeds, pests, and illnesses and thus are beneficial for the agricultural
field. Farmers use numerous pesticides to protect crops and for pre-
and post-harvesting purposes. It is predicted that implementing pesticides
entails approximately 30% of production of crops across the world.
Pesticides are organic toxic mixtures that are used to eliminate a
wide range of pests and can enter the food industry by different means,
leading to health issues for animals and humans. Researchers verified
that high exposure to pesticides may result in several illnesses.
Prompt detection of pesticides is extremely important because of their
toxicity and stability.

Karimi Maleh et al. presented a modified

GCE with GO was silanized using (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS).
Immobilization of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde on GO by Schiff base formation
is depicted in Figure 4. Examination of CV-modified electrode indicated two clarified redox
peaks with +0.380 and +0.277 V anodic and peak potentials, respectively,
associated with the FC/FC+ redox couple. The electrode
modified with FC displays exceptional electrocatalytic behavior concerning
catechol oxidation at a normal working voltage of +0.45 V (vs Ag/AgCl).
The reaction was linear within the 3–112 μM range of
catechol concentration at 1.1 μM concentration and 1184.3 μA
mM–1 cm–2 sensitivity. It was
used to determine catechol in lake water samples and spiked tap water.16

Liu et al. covalently modified a glassy carbon
substrate using
a combined layer of 4-aminophenyl and phenyl by appropriate electrografting
of their aryldiazonium salts within acidic mixtures. SWNTs were vertically
and covalently anchored onto the electrode surface by forming amide
bonds, resulting from the reaction among amines on the adjusted substrate
and carboxylic groups on the ends of nanotubes. For the next stage,
ferrocenedimethylamine (FDMA) was connected to the SWNT ends via amide
bonding prior to attaching an epitope (endosulfan hapten) that was
binded to an antibody, as depicted in Figure 5. Associating or disassociating the antibody
with a sensing interface results in ferrocene electrochemistry modulation.
The antibody complex electrodes were susceptible to spiked endosulfan
samples, i.e., unbound target analyte within environment water prior
to being examined via the SWV approach. For the purpose of detecting
the endosulfan across the 0.01–20 ppb via a disposition assay,
the designed electrochemical immunosensor was implemented. The minimum
detection limit for the immunosensor was 0.01 ppb endosulfan within
50 mM phosphate buffer and pH = 7.0.17

Jiao et al. fabricated a sensitive aptamer sensor
to quantitatively
detect chlorpyrifos. For the purpose improving aptasensor sensitivity,
modification of mesoporous carbon (OMC) functionalized by chitosan
(OMC–CS) and ferrocene hybrid chitosan (CS) dispersed multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (FC@MWCNTs-CS) was conducted at the electrode exterior
as depicted in Figure 6. More aptamer would be efficiently detected by FC@MWCNTs-CS while
increasing electron transfer between potassium ferricyanide and the
work electron surface because of the electrical conductivity and biocompatibility.
At the optimal state, the modified aptasensor displayed an extensive
linear range within 1–105 ng mL–1 at 0.33
ng mL–1 (S/N = 3) detection limit for chlorpyrifos.
The suggested chlopyrifos aptasensor displayed favorable selectivity,
stability, and reproducibility that enables ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos
residue detection within fruits and vegetables.18

4 Ferrocene and Ferrocene Derivative
Modified
Electrodes for Heavy Metals
The majority of metal ions is
cancerous and causes detrimental
health issues originating from the production of free radicals. Thus,
rapid and precise detection of metal ions is a vital issue. From the
various metal ions, chromium, mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic
possess the highest toxicity. In order to detect metal ions, electrochemical
sensors are designed. Developing such electrochemical sensors is a
prominent area of research for future prompt and quantitative analysis
entailing optimal sensitivity.19

The ferrocene-appended chalcone (FAC) based voltammetric sensors
were designed by Kamel et al. to selectivity detect the Cu(II) ion.
The CV approach of FAC displayed a changeable redox couple (Fe2+/Fe3+) when it was scanned within the 0.4 V to
−0.2 V vs Ag/Ag+ potential range. The CV method
of FAC is subjected to electrochemical variances because of the creation
of a FAC–Cu(II) composite when Cu(II) ions are added. Within
the 5.0 × 10–5–4.0 × 10–4 M concentration range at a 2.0 × 10–6 M detection
limit, the voltammetric sensor exhibits favorable performance. The
analytical benefits of the suggested sensors were approved further
by predicting Cu(II) ions in several specimen matrices with exceptional
outcomes.19

Research conducted by
Karthick et al. investigated nanomolar concentrations
of Pb2+ using GO–FV composite electrochemical sensing
which was amalgamated by a simple approach. On the basis of the CV
curves, with FC loaded on GO, the GO–FC compound was selected
to assess the lead sensing characteristics. Sensing examinations displayed
a 0.168 μg/L detection limit and 250 μg/L significant
sensitivity. The outcomes showed that GO–FC nanocomposites
may be utilized for sensing lead within environmental specimens.20

5 Ferrocene and Ferrocene Derivative
Modified
Electrodes for Food Analysis
One of the areas of continuous
focus is food safety. Pesticide
residue will directly or indirectly be detrimental to human health
when applied for the protection of crops. Thus, it is vital to promptly
and precisely oversee pesticide residue in foods.

Rabti et al.
proposed a compound including chitosan consisting
of azidomethylferrocene which was covalently immobilized on RGO-reduced
sheets and drop casted on polyester to create a screen-printed electrode
to determine nitrite via CHA and CV. Nitrite reduction and oxidation
can occur because of the electrode’s high electron transfer
rate. At optimal conditions, with a 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl potential
at pH = 7 solution, within the 2.5–1450 μM concentration
range at an ∼0.35 μM detection limit, the calibration
plot was linear. This sensor was used to detect nitrite in spiked
mineral water specimens with 95–101% restoration ranges.21

Huang et al. conducted a study where an
electro-active GO nanocomposite
was initially assembled by covalent grafting (4-ferrocenylethyne)
phenylamine (FC-NH2) onto the GO exterior. The GO-FC-NH2-incorporated hybridized nanocomposite coupled with HAuCl4 was concurrently electrodeposited on GCE to achieve RGO-FC-NH2/AuNPs/GCE. Applying the catalysis impact of the nanomaterial
and electron mediator coupling with a great active exterior and great
amassment scope of rGO-Fc-NH2/AuNPs leads to the successful
establishment of a synergetic signal enhancement platform to sensitively
determine bisephenol A. By using this sensor, the bisephenol A oxidation
peak currents linearly relied on bisephenol A concentration within
the 0.005–10 μM range at 2 nM detection limit.22

Wang and Anzai examined using DPV and
CV on ferrocene boronic acid
(FcBA), 1,1′-ferrocene diboronic acid (FcDBA), ferrocene carboxylic
acid (FcCA), 1,1′-ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (FCDCA), ferrocenylmethanol
(FCM), and ferrocenylethanol (FCE) on GCE with the existence of a
hypochlorite ion. The ferrocene compounds’ redox current in
DPV and CV was reduced, while hypochlorite ion concentration increased
at a μM level. The substituent within the ferrocene compounds
substantially impacted the electrochemical reaction to the hypochlorite
ion. From all tested FC compounds, FCBa, FCDBA, and boronic-acid-substituted
compounds exhibited higher sensitivity toward the hypochlorite ion
compared to alkylated Fc derivatives and carboxylic acid due to higher
C-bond reactivity in FCDBA and FCBA to the hypochlorite ion. These
ferrocene compounds may be implemented as redox markers to detect
hypochlorite ions in water.23

Kanyong
et al. designed a screen-printed electrode that was modified
using ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
([EMIM][BF4]), ferrocene carboxylic acid (FCA), and cellulose
acetate (CA) to electrochemically sense hydrogen peroxide within commercially
packed aseptic milk. The modified electrode was successful in the
sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide, while there were no interferences
from electro-active species, namely, uric acid, glucose, dopamine,
and ascorbic acid. The linear range to determine hydrogen peroxide
was within 1.0 μM–1.2 mM at 0.35 μM detection limit
and 10.6 nA μA–1 μM–1 cm–2 sensitivity. The resulting accuracy, i.e., n = 6, and recoveries were 0.53% and 97.8% when applied
to analyze hydrogen peroxide residues within milk.24

Mattousi et al. investigated a maperometric hydrogen
peroxide sensor
on the basis of redox-active polymer by physically entrapping FCA
onto a cross-connected aminopoly(ether sulfone) film (signified as
FCAPS) in a single-stage procedure at the surface of GCE. This electrode
displayed favorable redox activity originating from a ferrocene/ferrocenium
redox couple. This sensing platform was most efficient at an optimum
voltage of +0.6 V versus SCE and demonstrated electrocatalytic behavior
in regard to the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide at a 2.07 μM
(at S/N = 3) detection limit and 10 μM–10 mM wide linear
range. This electrode was useful in detecting H2O2 within refined cow milk specimens with significant restorations.25

7 Conclusions
This is a concise mini-review on current advancements in the field
of modified sensor and biosensor design via the implementation of
FC as a modifier. FC as a typical type of metalocenes aroused intensive
attention owing to its unique electronic and chemical features. The
mini-review discusses recent developments in applying FC for electrochemical
sensing. The advantages of FC have enabled the creation of extensive
electrochemical sensors and biosensors that demonstrate favorable
analytical properties. The improved electrochemical response is coupled
to resistance to surface fouling which entails high stability. These
advancements imply that future interdisciplinary work may lead to
new generations of sensors and biosensors based on FC for extensive
uses. Meanwhile, there also remain challenges for the use of FC in
the sensoring such as material conductivity, structural stability
and integrity, and further functionalization toward desirable features.
Therefore, it is noteworthy that real biosensing prospects of FC will
emerge in the future by obtaining more research efforts.
