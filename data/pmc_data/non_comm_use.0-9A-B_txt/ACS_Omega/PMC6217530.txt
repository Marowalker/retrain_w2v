Herein, the fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with blue emission
were prepared by hydrothermal treatment using pineapple peel as a
source of carbon. The as-prepared CDs exhibited turn-Off fluorescence
behavior toward Hg2+ and subsequent turn-On behavior for l-cysteine along with enhanced biocompatibility and negligible
cytotoxicity for cell imaging. The practical applicability of carbon
dots was used for the quantification of Hg2+ in water.
On the basis of the spectral characteristic changes, we have designed
individual elementary logic operations such as NOT and IMP gates,
by utilizing CD as probe and Hg2+ and l-Cys as
chemical inputs. We have also demonstrated the utility of this system
in electronic security devices and as memory element, with the idea
of the switching.

Introduction
Carbon dots (CDs), a new member of fluorescent nanosized carbon
materials, with sizes of less than 10 nm, have received increased
attention of many researchers because of their superior resistance
to photobleaching, increased chemical- and photostability, least toxicity,
low cost, and abundant availability as raw materials in nature.1 The recent developments of CDs were due to their
promising applications in biological imaging,2 sensor materials,3 drug carriers,4 photocatalysts,5 and
photothermal therapy.6 Much efforts have
been focused on the facile synthesis of CDs by electrochemical method,
thermal method, hydrothermal method, acidic oxidation, microwave,
ultrasonic treatment, and laser ablation.7 More recently, hydrothermal treatment was used because of low cost
and nontoxic routes for producing novel carbon materials; it involves
dehydration followed by in situ surface passivation.

CDs obtained
from different natural resources have been reported from small molecules
to wastes, vegetables, and fruits.8−11 Mostly, carbon dots
have least solubility in water and this has limited their analytical
applications.12 Pineapple peel is widely
produced during the processing of pineapple to get juices and salads.13 The main contents of the pineapple peel are
cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin, in which cellulose occupies
20–25% of the dry weight.14 Hg2+ is the most dangerous inorganic pollutant and causes environmental
and health concerns.15 Mercury exposure
may lead to digestive, renal,
and neurological diseases.16 Due to these
adverse effects of Hg2+ ions, there is an urgent need to
develop a convenient and rapid method to detect Hg2+.17 Herein, in this study, pineapple peel was chosen
as a precursor to prepare CDs. The CDs were successfully applied as
a fluorescence probe for cell imaging and sensitive detection of Hg2+ in living cells, and also applications as a molecular keypad
lock and memory device have been reported.

Results and Discussions
The CDs were prepared by simple
hydrothermal treatment of pineapple peel as precursor. The main constituents
of pineapple peel were cellulose (40–46%), hemicellulose (16–20%),
lignin (12–16%), and pectin (8–12%).18 The resultant CDs exhibited excellent water solubility
and a blue color under a UV lamp (365 nm), illustrating that the carbon
dots are showing strong blue fluorescence. The quantum yield of the
CDs (quinine sulfate in 0.1 mol L–1 H2SO4, excited at 340 nm) was about 42% (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which is much higher
than that in previous reports.9d,10a−10c

The dimension and morphology
of the CDs observed under high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM), as shown in Figure 1A, clearly demonstrate unvarying and monodisperse nature of
the CDs. HRTEM image (Figure 1B inset) shows lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing
of 0.20 nm, which is close to the (102) facet of graphite.10a The particle size distribution (Figure 1C) of CDs displays the size
distribution as mainly between 2 and 3 nm. Raman spectra of CDs (Figure 1D) showed the bands
at 1374 and 1589 cm–1 for
the structure of polyaromatic sp2-hybrid carbon network
in two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of a graphite cluster.19

(C) particle size distribution from HRTEM; (D) Raman spectra of CDs.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of
as-prepared CDs in Figure 2A revealed a broad diffraction peak centered at 2θ =
24.7°, which is attributed to crystalline graphite (sp2 hybridization). Generally, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum
is used to identify the surface functional groups of CDs. The CDs
exhibited a broad peak at ∼3315 cm–1, which
is characteristic of the stretching vibrations of −OH. The
peaks centered at 1634 and 1040 cm–1 were ascribed
to the stretching vibration of C=C and C–O–C
respectively, indicating the presence of sp2 (Figure 2B).

To get
an insight into the elemental composition and chemical bonds of the
prepared carbon dots, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
are carried out. The high-resolution XPS spectra for C 1s are divided
into three unit moieties, with the binding energy being 284.1, 285.7,
and 288.3 eV (Figure 3A). They are assigned as C=C/C–C, C–OH/C–O–C,
and O–C=O, respectively.9 Similarly deconvoluted O 1s (Figure 3B) peaks centered at 530.6 and 532.1 correspond to
the C=O and C–OH groups, respectively.21 The presence of these C=O and C–OH groups
suggests that these hydrophilic moieties facilitate CDs to disperse
in aqueous solution. The photophysical properties of the CDs were
investigated by UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The characteristic
absorption peak at 280 nm is assigned to the π–π*
transition of C=C, as observed from the CDs prepared by the
carbonization of carbon-based materials.8d,10a As illustrated in the insets of Figure 4A, the solution color of CDs is yellow under
visible light (left), whereas a blue emission is observed upon exciting
with UV light of 365 nm (right).

images of the CDs under room light (left) and UV light (right) in
an aqueous solution. (B) Excitation-dependent PL spectra of the CDs
in an aqueous solution.

Figure 4B demonstrates the optical properties of
CDs, i.e., excitation-dependent PL behavior. Upon changing the excitation
wavelength, the peak is red-shifted and the peak intensity decreases
due to different surface sites and particle size. The fluorescence
intensities remain constant at high salt concentrations (up to 1000
mM), showing high stability of the CDs even under high ionic strength
conditions and also showing maximum intensity at physiological pH
(Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information).
This might be due to the protonation and deprotonation of the surface
oxygeneous groups in acidic and basic environment, which agrees with
earlier reports.19,20 To determine whether these might
affect measurement of CDs, interference experiments were conducted
on common metal ions in the presence of the CDs (0.1 mg mL–1, Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The fluorescence response of CDs was examined under identical conditions
by treatment of 0.1 mg mL–1 CD solution with 50
μM Ag+, Al3+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Fe3+ Pb2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+ ions. Figure 5A shows a gradual
decrease in fluorescence intensity with increasing concentration of
Hg2+.

Figure 5 (A) Titrimetric quenching pattern of the fluorescence
intensity of CD (1 mg mL–1) in phosphate-buffered
saline solution (pH 7.4) after addition of Hg2+ ion; (B)
Stern–Volmer fitting.

We checked the interference of other metal
ions by competitive binding, such as Ag+, Al3+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, toward Hg2+ sensing by CDs; it is found that there is
no interference for Hg2+ sensing. The fluorescence quenching
of CDs upon addition of Hg2+ ions may be attributed to
the excited-state electron-transfer reaction of the CDs to the Hg2+ ion.21 As shown in Figure 5B, the Stern–Volmer
plot shows linearity in the concentration range of 0.1–100
μM, yielding a KSV of 2.2 ×
104 M–1. The detection limit is estimated
to be 4.5 nM. The reversibility of the CD–Hg2+ complex
been investigated by adding amino acids.

The emission spectra
of CD–Hg2+ complex with various amino acids, such
as alanine (Ala), lysine (Lys), aspartic acid (Asp), arginine (Arg),
methionine (Met), proline (Pro), threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp),
histidine (His), valine (Val), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser),
and l-cysteine (Cys), were recorded (Figure S5, Supporting Information).10e The results clearly indicate that other amino acids except cysteine
do not show any fluorescence changes, i.e., the intensity of fluorescence
remained constant. However, addition of l-Cys resulted in
the enhancement of emission intensity. The limit of detection of CDs/Hg2+ ensembles with l-Cys was calculated to be 8.7 ×
10–7 M on 3σ/s. However,
a decrease in the excited-state lifetime after the Hg2+ complex formation confirms that the quenching process is dynamic
in nature. Figure 6 shows the excited-state lifetime in the absence and presence of
Hg2+ ions.

Figure 6 Lifetime data of only
CDs and with Hg2+ (λex = 320 nm; λem = 435 nm).

The lifetime quenches from 2.95 ns (τ1 = 2.38, τ2 = 0.57) to 2.51 ns (τ1 = 2.22, τ2 = 0.29) upon addition of Hg2+. The significant reduction in the lifetime value indicates
that the quenching process is dynamic in nature and takes place via
an excited-state electron-transfer reaction.19a

The Stern–Volmer constant (KSV of 2.2 × 104 M–1) suggests the
dynamic quenching of fluorescence on the addition of Hg2+ to CDs; this dynamic quenching by ultrafast electron transfer from
Hg2+ to CDs is further confirmed by fluorescence lifetime
measurements. Hence, the Hg2+-induced quenching of CDs
is due to electron transfer from Hg2+ to CDs. The sensing
properties of CDs toward Hg2+ are reproducible; we carried
out the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to CD–Hg2+ system to check their reproducibility; it is noticed that
even after five cycles, the CDs are able to sense Hg2+,
indicating that the CD sensing performance is reproducible. We studied
the temperature dependency to the fluorescence of CDs with varying
temperature; it is observed that increase in temperature leads to
decrease in fluorescence intensity.

The exciting photophysical
properties, such as high sensitivity, selectivity, and fast response,
of CDs with Hg2+ prompted us to investigate their potential
use in real-time monitoring of Hg2+ ions in living cells
via fluorescence imaging. It is well known that apart from being toxic,
Hg2+ ion has a tendency to bind with estrogen receptors
in breast cancer cells, causing amplified cell growth and estrogenic
effects, such as irregular menstruation, reproductive tract, the urinary
tract disorders, and formation of abnormal secondary sexual characteristics
like armpit hair and neural disorders. Hence, the recognition of the
mercury ions in these cells is a challenge.

To demonstrate the
possible cellular toxicity of CDs toward HeLa and MCF-7 cells, the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay
was carried out. The cell viabilities were calculated upon exposure
of different concentrations to the carbon dots (Figure S6 Supporting Information), which revealed that the
CDs exhibited extremely low cytotoxicity, i.e., viability of about
92% at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1 after 24 h
incubation, and viability over 84% even high concentration (1 mg mL–1).

HeLa cells incubated with carbon dots and
imaged through the fluorescence microscope show distinct fluorescence
inside the cells, confirming the cellular uptake of CDs (Figure 7). The cells treated
with CDs were incubated with Hg2+ ions for 10 min. The
results showed that Hg2+ reduces the intensity of the fluorescence
of CDs in biological systems, also thereby making CDs as efficient
probe for intracellular Hg2+ detection. The bright-field
image of cells treated with carbon dots and Hg2+ inveterate
that the cells were viable throughout the experimental conditions.
This observation established that the CDs could act as a potential
candidate for the intracellular detection of Hg2+.

and 561 nm (D) and bright-field images (A). The scale bar indicates
20 μm.

Turn-On fluorescence and selective sensing of l-Cys among
all other amino acids by CDs–Hg2+ ensemble encouraged
us to explore its use for the cellular imaging of l-cysteine
in living fibroblasts (Figure S9) and HeLa
cells (Figure S7, Supporting Information).
The cells were incubated with CD–Hg2+ ensemble (10
μM) for 10 min and the CD–Hg2+ added cells
were washed with buffer before imaging through confocal fluorescence
microscopy. Very bright blue fluorescence from the inside of the cells
was observed, showing the presence of intracellular biothiols, as
shown in Figure S9B. Another set of cells
was pretreated with a known biothiol quencher N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM) in culture media. The NEM pretreated cells are incubated with
CD–Hg2+ ensemble. The cells did not exhibit any
observable fluorescence changes, as shown in Figure S9C. This proved the CD–Hg2+ is permeable
to cell wall and the resulted changes account for the changes in the
intracellular thiol level. The bright-field images confirmed that
the cells were viable throughout the experiments. These results provided
a way to monitor the changes of l-cysteine levels in the
living cells. To ensure the intrusion of glutathione (GSH) during
cysteine detection in living cells, we intend to verify whether the
fluorescence increase is due to cys or GSH. We used an inhibitor for
GSH synthesis l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) assay. BSO-treated
cells were imaged, showing the increase in fluorescence when compared
with the control that is untreated with BSO. On the other hand, when
the cells were treated with BSO + H2O2, they
showed decrease in fluorescence intensity (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Further, confocal images of the
BSO + H2O2-treated cells on treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (a precursor for Cys), showed a dramatic
increase in fluorescence intensity, obviously indicating that the
fluorescence enhancement is exclusively due to changes in intracellular
cysteine rather than intracellular GSH.10

Design of the Logic Gate
Designing
logic gates utilizing electronic circuits in nanoregime is essential
in molecular computation. Molecular logic gates mimic electronic circuits
by performing Boolean arithmetic operations in the form of physicochemical
and biological changes as their inputs. This type of logic gate was
fabricated using the fluorescence response of the probe used with
the different analytes on the basis of the consequent changes in the
fluorescence intensity of the probe.

On the basis of the spectral
characteristic changes, we have designed individual elementary logic
operations, such as NOT and IMP gates, by utilizing CDs as probe and
Hg2+ and l-Cys as chemical inputs.22a The fluorescence intensity change at 435 nm
was fixed as the output signal. The output signal is considered as
“On” state with a Boolean arithmetic value of “1”
with the original or initial value of the emission intensity and considered
as “Off” state with Boolean arithmetic value of “0”
when the emission is quenched by 50%.

Interpretation of Logic Gate with Two Inputs
In a two-input
logic operation, CD operates as gate and analytes (Hg2+, l-Cys) as the two chemical inputs (Figure 8). Boolean arithmetic expressions 0 and 1
were considered as inputs for the gate with and without of the analytes,
correspondingly.22 Difference in the emission
intensity at 435 nm of CD was considered as the output signal for
analyzing On and Off states in the system. Different chemical inputs
with four possible input string combinations (0,0; 1,0; 0,1; 1,1)
were carried out. Presence of the metal ion Hg2+ as input
in the absence of its counter anion l-Cys, the system expressed
NOT gate (Figure 8),
the simplest of all logic gates. The quenching of the CD fluorescence
is due to the formation of CD–Hg2+ complex aided
by the presence of oxygenous hydrophilic groups. These results corroborate
with the NOT gate, i.e., Off state. Further, upon addition of the
counter anion l-Cys (input 2), the fluorescence behavior
was reversed, with almost 85% increase in the emission intensity (Figure 8). The high affinity
of Hg2+ for the −SH group favors the formation of
Hg2+–l-Cys complex, which separates the
metal ion from the hydrophilic groups on the surface of CD, thereby
recovering the fluorescence of CDs. Thus, an IMP gate has been constructed
by using Hg2+ and l-Cys as inputs 1 and 2, respectively.
The presence of both inputs 1 and 2 in the system expressed an On
state. This clearly confirms that the decreased emission intensity
in CD–Hg2+ is recovered by the stable Hg2+–l-Cys complex formation. The truth table also confirms
the IMP gate (Figure 8) behavior. The overall gate functions are represented in the Scheme 1. Thus, this CD nano-chemosensor
can be used as a chemical logic gate for identification of mercury
in real samples via fluorescent switching behavior pattern.

Security Lock Device
The keypad lock
development is interesting because a new approach for protecting information
at a molecular level and has been utilized for various sensitive restricted
data applications.23 We have tried the
utility of this system in electronic security devices, with the idea
of a switching behavior in the present CD system (Figure 9). We checked the difference
in the emission behavior in a keypad security lock system (Figure 9). The utility of
CD is as a probe in a security keypad sensing device for Hg2+; fluorescent probe CD was subjected to the chemical inputs (Hg2+, l-Cys) either separately or in combination with
CD (CD–Hg2+, CD–l-Cys). The molecular
thiol in l-Cys will form a strong Hg2+–SH
bond, resulting in desorption of Hg2+ from CD surface,
leading to a “Off–On” behavior. Thus, while operating,
if we first add l-Cys to the system containing CD–Hg2+ (quenched state), the relative emission intensity will be
close to that of CD, i.e., fluorescence was almost recovered to 85%,
which implies On state, with respect to the probe CD, whereas if we
added Hg2+ to the system containing CD–l-Cys (already fluorescence), the fluorescence was almost the same
(no change in fluorescence) with respect to CD, which denotes the
Off state. Thus, with the change in the regulation of the inputs,
the output signals (fluorescence) will be changed, enabling us to
use the probe CD in a molecular keypad lock. The lock can be removed
(“turn-On” state) using the order of inputs as 1 →
Hg2+ → l-Cys, whereas we can lock (“turn-Off”
state) the device using the order of inputs as 1 → l-Cys → Hg2+.

Figure 9 (A) Schematic
representation of a keypad security lock model using CD as the molecular
fluorescence system; (B) bar diagram representing the change in the
emission intensity of CD. Chemical inputs were represented
as H and C for Hg2+ and l-Cys and O and F for
On and Off states, respectively.

To demonstrate the security
lock device in terms of crossword puzzles, the analytes used as chemical
inputs were named as H and C for Hg2+ and l-cysteine,
respectively, and the fluorescence emission was considered as the
output signal. The symbols O and F were noted for On and Off states.
While executing the password, pressing C followed by H, the emission
output will turn the switch on (O), i.e. turn-On state. However, pressing
H and then C will cause no change in the output emission; the device
remains locked, i.e., turn-Off state (F). Thus, the password “HCF”
will lock the device whereas the password “CHO” opens
the lock without fail.

Memory Device
This system can be used as a memory element, in molecular-level
information processing for its unique switching nature: reversible
response with alternate addition of Hg2+ and l-Cys (Figure 10).
Generally, sequential circuits in memory devices store the information
and operate through a response loop, where one output in the logic
system serves as a memory element.24 For
mimicking the memory element, we have used the chemical input Hg2+ (input 1) and Cys (input 2) as Reset (R) and Set (S), respectively.
The emission intensity is taken as the output signal (Figure 10). When the reset input (input
1) shows a quenching effect, i.e., low emission, the system is considered
in “Off-state”, where the system “Read”
the information, “Erase” it, and saves the “output”
as 0. The above stored information, in other words, memorized information,
was considered as “Write” by set input (input 2) and
saves the output as 1. This “Write-Erase” cycle on CD
probe can be performed for multiple cycles by adding Hg2+ and Cys in alternate sequence. This Off–On reversible behavior
using chemical analytes represents the “Write-Read-Erase-Read”
nature (Figure 10).
Thus, this system can be used as molecular microprocessors, a substitute
for the traditional memory element in integrated logic circuits. To
test and ensure the practical applications of the carbon dots to sense
Hg(II) in water samples (lake and tap water), standard recovery experiments
were performed. The water samples were added with different known
quantities of Hg2+ and l-cysteine to compare and
to imitate the real-environment measurements. It is apparent that
the carbon dot-based Hg(II) chemosensor system is reliable and valid
for detecting Hg2+ in water samples (Table S2, Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a simple,
low-cost, direct, and green one-pot method to produce CDs from the
pineapple waste (peel) without any oxidizing agents through hydrothermal
treatment. The CDs in aqueous solution emit strong blue light under
a UV lamp with a fluorescent quantum yield of 0.42. This CD-based
sensing system shows an ultraselective and sensitive fluorescent probe
for label-free Hg2+ ion detection and has been successfully
used for visual identification and quantitation of Hg2+ in real water samples from lake and tap water with satisfactory
results. Further studies showed that the CDs can be used as a fluorescent
probe for cellular imaging of Hg2+. The CDs exhibited multiple
logic gates and were capable of mimicking a security keypad lock device
at the molecular level with chemical inputs of Hg2+ ion
and l-Cys. The CDs have also been used as molecular microprocessors,
an alternative for the traditional memory element in integrated logic
circuits.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Carbon Dots
CDs were prepared
from pineapple peel by hydrothermal method similar to the procedure
used by us.21a In a typical procedure,
the peel of pineapple was rinsed many times with water to remove the
filth particles and was made into juice. Ten milliliters of the extract
and 10 mL of ethanol were taken, and the reaction was preceded in
an autoclave at 150 °C for 2 h, followed by extraction with methylene
chloride and dialysis through a cellulose dialysis membrane. The aqueous
solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min to separate
the less-fluorescent deposit. Excess acetone was added in the upper
brown solution and centrifuged at high speed (15 000 rpm) for
15 min to obtain highly fluorescent CDs of average size 3–4
nm. As-obtained CDs were lyophilized and redispersed in water (1 mg
mL–1) for further use.
