In the melanin synthesis
process, oxidative reactions play an essential
role, and it is a good strategy to inhibit melanin production by reducing
oxidative stress. Fullerene and its derivatives, or the complexes,
were considered as strong free-radical scavengers, and we further
applied multilayered sp2 nanocarbons to discover melanin
synthesis inhibitory mechanisms. In the present study, we used novel
nanomaterials, such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), short-type
MWCNTs, graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs), and short-type GONRs,
as anti-oxidative agents to regulate melanin production. The results
showed that GONRs had better anti-oxidative capabilities in intracellular
and extracellular oxidative stress analysis platforms than others.
We proposed that GONRs have oxygen-containing functional groups. In
the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay,
we found out GONR could chelate metal ions to scavenge reactive oxygen
species. In the molecular insight view, we observed that these nanomaterials
downregulated the melanin synthesis by decreasing microphthalmia-associated
transcription factor-related gene expressions, and there were similar
consequences in protein expressions. To sum up, GONRs is a potential
agent as a novel antioxidant and skin-whitening cosmetology material.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Skin is the organ that
covers the outer surface of a human body.
Since the interface is in contact with the environment, the skin layer
plays an important role in protecting the body against pathogens,
avoiding excessive water loss, regulating body temperature, and so
on. Melanocytes grow in the basal membrane of the skin epidermis and
account for 5% to 10% of the cellular content. They have been characterized
as unicellular “glands” having thin, long, streamer-like
dendrites and branching. Melanocytes move through the epidermal cells
in their immediate vicinity, creating a constellation of epidermal
cells around each melanocyte. There are many internal and external
causes to skin aging, and one such factor is ultraviolet (UV) radiation
from sunlight.1 During UV exposure, the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the skin increase dramatically,
which is known as oxidative stress. Several environmental toxicity
factors also enhance oxidative stress to the skin, such as pesticides,
carbon tetrachloride, heavy metals, aromatic amines, and particulate
matter 2.5 (PM2.5).2 In the biochemical
mechanism, the intracellular oxidants are generated from the non-enzymatic
system, transforming them into ROS to trigger the melanogenesis pathway.3

In addition to ROS, there are many factors
that affect melanin
production, including gene expression, inflammation, endocrine changes,
and pigment uptake.1 In the first steps
of melanin production, tyrosinase plays a role in catalyzing tyrosine
into phenomelanin and eumelanin. Both pigments’ manufacturing
mechanisms are similar, which include l-tyrosine hydroxylation
to 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA) and l-DOPA oxidation to dopaquinone. In the next step, dopamine
is oxidized by tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1) and tyrosinase-related
protein 2 (TRP-2) in melanosome, which are regulated by the microphthalmia-associated
transcription factor (MITF) to form melanin. Finally, melanin is matured
and precipitated within the stratum corneum.4,5 These
penetrate the neighboring keratinocytes of the basal layer and protect
their DNA from any UV-induced mutations or modifications. The matured
melanin within melanosomes is transferred to keratinocytes6−9 and finally leads to a long-lasting pigmentation. Lentigines, freckles,
and brown/black spots cause social problems in men and women sometimes.
Blocking the oxidative stress or suppressing the tyrosinase activity
is one strategy to downregulate the syndrome of hyper-pigmentation
and dermatological disorders. Antioxidants heal ROS-caused hyper-pigmentations
and cellular damages.10,11 Therefore, synthesized anti-oxidative
compounds have many biofunctional applications in skin care applications.

Fullerene (C60), carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, and
graphene nanoribbon (GNR) are four kinds of sp2 nanocarbon widely researched around the world.12 Fullerene and its derivatives or complexes have been considered
strong free-radical scavengers for a long time. Yodoh et al. used
water-soluble C60 as a protective agent against catabolic
stress-induced degeneration. Injac et al. concluded that C60(OH)24 is a strong antioxidant compound when the oxidative
stress is too high. Okuda et al. suggested that C60 complexes
can prevent NO-mediated cell injury.13,14 Tong et al.
showed that C60 complexes might be promising candidates
for treating brain-related diseases caused by increased levels of
superoxide. Actually, a Japanese company identified fullerenes with
a strong antioxidant activity for cosmetic use in 2006. Lucente-Schultz
et al. demonstrated that the oxygen radical scavenging ability of
functionalized single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) is nearly 40 times greater
than that of dendritic C60.15−19 Fenoglio et al. observed that multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs)
possess a remarkable radical scavenging capacity in contact with an
external source of hydroxyl or superoxide radical.20 Density functional theory calculations also revealed a
model of SWCNTs as free-radical scavengers. In 2004, Novoselov et
al. first demonstrated that graphene exhibited a strong ambipolar
electric effect and could be promising for electronic applications.21 Following that, they continued to show that
graphene has electronic properties that are distinctive for a 2D gas
of particles described by the Dirac equation.22,23 Since these two groundbreaking papers, more and more attention has
been given to the graphene-based research.24−30 For example, Qiu et al. in 2014 showed that graphene oxide and few-layer
graphene exhibit a significant antioxidant activity and can protect
various biomolecular molecules from oxidation.31 Han et al. experimentally demonstrated in 2007 that the
energy gap of GNRs can be controlled during the lithography process
by changing the ribbon width.32 Among the
four nanocarbons, GNRs have received the least attention. To our knowledge,
there is little research on the antioxidant properties of graphene
oxide nanoribbons (GONRs).31,33 Hence, in this study,
we carefully prepared MWCNTs, short MWCNTs, GONRs, and short GONRs
and aimed to compare their antioxidant properties and related results
systematically.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology of MWCNTs and GONRs
Figure 1a shows the low-
and high-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of MWCNTs and short MWCNTs. Following acidic cutting under ultrasonication,
the length of MWCNTs could be shortened from >10 μm to 2–3
μm. Simultaneously, it was observed that the nitric acid treatment
roughens the smooth tube surfaces. Some notches and irregular shapes
are displayed in the high-magnification picture. Further, using MWCNTs
and short MWCNTs through microwave reactions obtains GONR and short
GONR, respectively. We also illustrated the low- and high-magnification
TEM pictures of GONR and short GONR. Owing to the major longitudinal
unzipping and minor horizontal cutting, it seems that GONRs were shorter
than MWCNTs. On the other hand, high-magnification pictures showed
larger diameters, that is, 0.11–0.18 μm, of GONRs than
those of MWCNTs, indicating that the unzipping process was successful.
Similarly, short GONRs exhibited a shorter length and larger diameter
than short MWCNTs. In the air compressor of our new unzipping process,
the thin layered structures of the GONRs were less than what we obtained
in the early report for the same microwave power of 250 W while maintaining
the thicker central MWCNTs.12 This meant
a core–shell MWCNT/GONR heterostructure would more likely appear
instead of the fully unzipped nanoribbon structure through all microwave
powers in the new process. To compare with the short GONR in our previous
studies,34 the higher microwave power generated
more notches on the side of the ribbons and did not form nice, smooth
ribbon edges. Note that we used two different kinds of Cu grids in Figure 1a. For MWCNTs and
GONRs with enough length, the Gu grid with a lacey formvar stabilized
with carbon (product no. 01881-F, Ted Pella, Inc., USA) was utilized.
The open holes in a lacey carbon film prevented an overlapping transmission
image between nanocarbons and the carbon film. The dark gray networks
belong to the lacey carbon film. However, the Gu grid with formvar
stabilized with carbon (product no. 01800-F, Ted Pella, Inc., USA)
was needed for short MWCNT and short GONR. This was because the big
holes in the lacey carbon film caused problems for holding the short
MWCNT and short GONR efficiently. As illustrated in Figure 1, the light gray contrast beneath
the short MWCNTs and short GONRs is a light layer of carbon. This
carbon layer stabilized the formvar film exposed to the electron beam
via its heat- and electrical-conducting properties.

Figure 1 (a) Low-magnification
and high-magnification TEM picture of MWCNTs
and GONRs. (b) Raman spectra of four nanocarbons. The D band of GONRs
is higher than that of MWCNTs after the unzipping process. (c,d) display
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra of four nanocarbons.
Apparently, the D′ peak is the most evident for short GONRs.

2.2 Bonding Configurations
of MWCNTs and GONRs
The Raman spectra of the four nanocarbons
are presented in Figure 1b; the D band of
GONRs was higher than that of MWCNTs after the unzipping process.
This was attributed to the higher oxidation level and greater number
of edge structures of GONR compared to MWCNTs. This phenomenon is
also similar to what we observed in 2011.12 Owing to the high graphitization level, the G band of MWCNTs had
the lowest full-width-at- half-maximum number. The ID/IG ratios of the four nanocarbons
were 0.076, 0.502, 0.483, and 0.700, respectively. Briefly, the decreased
length and surface oxidation increased the defect level and thus made
the ID/IG ratios
higher. The D′ peak is present in all defective graphenes and
is viewed as a measure of quality.35 As
illustrated in Figure 1b, the D′ peaks in the four spectra become more prominent
after either the cutting or unzipping process, suggesting that they
are destructive processes that introduce many defects. Figure 1c,d display the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy spectra of the four nanocarbons. Apparently, the D′
peak is the clearest for short GONRs. As shown in Figure 1c, the O level significantly
increased from 7.6% (MWCNTs) to 19.9% (GONRs) due to the strong oxidation
ability of KMnO4 in an acidic environment. On the other
hand, the O level slightly increased by 0.8% from MWCNT to the short
MWCNTs. Importantly, the highest O level is 38.3% for the short GONR,
implying that the ends of the nanoribbons would be easier to attach
oxygen functional groups than the planar sp2 surfaces. The larger full-width-at-half-maximum number and the shift
to a high binding energy of C 1s peaks after the unzipping process
of both MWCNTs and short MWCNTs are illustrated in Figure 1d. For graphene oxides, the
deconvoluted peaks in the high-binding-energy side could be assigned
to C–C(C=C), C–O, C=O, and COOH bondings.36 We characterized GONR (200 W) in 2013,37 and the results were similar to this study results.
This study concluded the phenomena of Raman spectra, meaning that
more oxygen-containing functional groups were generated during the
tube-to-ribbon transformation (Figure 2).

GONRs and short GONRs.

2.3 Anti-oxidative
Properties of MWCNTs and GONRs
2.3.1 Determination
of 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
Free Radical Scavenging Activity Assays
1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) free-radical scavenging activity is an antioxidant platform
applied to detect the anti-oxidative capacity; the results for the
four nanocarbons are described in Table 2. In the DPPH assay, vitamin
C at a concentration of 100 μM was used as a positive control.
To test the anti-oxidative activities of MWCNTs, short MWCNTs, GONRs,
and short GONRs, dosages of 1, 5, and 10 mg/L were incubated into
the reaction solution to measure the properties. MWCNTs, short MWCNTs,
GONRs, and short GONRs had moderate inhibitory abilities at 10 mg/L
(19.2 ± 0.3, 12.1 ± 0.3, 26.8 ± 0.3, and 30.0 ±
0.4%), while vitamin C had a similar condition at 100 μM (93.4
± 0.1%) for the suppression.

2.3.2 Ion-Chelating Activity
Assay
Within
the oxidative stress situation, the ferrozine can develop a complex
with Fe2+ to be measured quantitatively. In the presence
of chelating mediators, the complex is broken, causing the ferrous
ions to reduce from a dark red color of the Fe2+ complex.
We used EDTA as the positive control. Table 2 shows that MWCNTs, short MWCNTs, GONRs,
and short GONRs had chelating activity at 10 mg/L (29.2 ± 0.8,
28.7 ± 0.7, 69.7 ± 0.6, and 68.9 ± 0.3%), while the
positive control had the similar condition at 100 μM (93.4 ±
0.1%).

2.3.3 Ferric-Reducing Antioxidant Power Measurement
The ferric-reducing potential assay is a simple and reliable test
used to quantify the Fe(III)–ferricyanide complex synthesis.
In this assay, the reducing power of the four nanocarbons producing
the ferrous Fe(III)–TPTZ complex was detected by changes in
the color of the solution from yellow to green and blue. Table 2 demonstrates that
the reducing powers of MWCNT, short MWCNT, GONR, and short GONR were
optical density (OD) 1.11, 1.13, 1.15, and 1.11 at 10 mg/L.

2.3.4 MWCNTs and GONRs Inhibit Intracellular ROS
Accumulation
Many reports have shown that ROS destroys the
structural integrity of cell membranes, including cell membranes and
nuclear membranes to lead to cell damage and to loss of normal function.38−40 In addition, ROS is also one of the important factors to catalyze
tyrosinase forming melanin, and the inhibition of ROS production is
a good strategy to downregulate melanin synthesis. In this study,
we used the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(DCFDA) staining assay to analyze the intracellular oxidative stress
level in MWCNT and GONR treatment cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) induced oxidative stimulations in MWCNT and GONR groups and
was used as a negative control.41 When
the concentration of PMA was 20 ng/mL, it induced oxidative stress,
increasing the value to 38%; after treating GONRs and MWCNTs, the
levels of ROS were downregulated to the normal level. The data showed
that both materials inhibited oxidative stress levels, and the anti-oxidative
effect of GONRs was higher than that of MWCNTs (Figure 3). Table 1 shows a similar consequence list. We contended that
there are three reasons for our new findings: first, the order of
solubility of these materials was as follows: short GONRs > GONRs
> short MWCNTs > MWCNTs, meaning that the contact area of short
GONRs
was the largest, so it was superior for ROS scavenging. Second, GONRs
and MWCNTs were sp2-carbon structures that
could destroy ROS electricity through adduct formation or electron
transfer.42 We found that the antioxidant
effects of the nanoribbon structures were better than those of the
nanotube structures, so nanoribbons make it easier to transfer electrons
than nanotubes. Finally, in Figure 1b, we observe that the GONR sp2-carbon site
contained more oxygen functional groups than MWCNTs, the carboxylic
acid groups could chelate metal ions, and the hydroxyl groups could
be a H-donor to scavenge ROS and inhibit melanin production.

Figure 3 DCFDA assay
results showing that MWCNTs and GONRs treatment decreased
the ROS production in B16 F10 cells. All data points were done in
triplicates (*P < 0.01; Student’s t-test).

2.4 Cytotoxicity
of MWCNTs and GONRs Treated in
Human Dermal Fibroblast Cells
The 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method was applied to evaluate the cytotoxic properties
of GONRs on Hs68 cells (Figure 3), and cells were cultured at different doses of 1, 5, and
10 μg/mL. We examined that the cell viabilities of MWCNT were
100.7 ± 3.7, 99.8 ± 4.9, and 94.1 ± 4.7% at concentrations
of 1, 5, and 10 mg/L, respectively; viabilities for the short MWCNT
were calculated in the same order and were found to be 93.9 ±
2.2, 86.4 ± 3.0, and 98.9 ± 2.1%. We observed that the B16–F10
cells were incubated in high concentrations, and the cell survival
of Hs68 cells was more than 80%, suggesting that the MWCNT and short
MWCNT had no toxic effect on human dermal fibroblasts cells. The cell
viabilities of GONR and short GONR were 86.24 ± 2.1, 90.87 ±
3.5, 88.58 ± 2.5, 89.03 ± 3.6, 90.71 ± 2.8, and 90.64
± 2.5%. It is also pointed out in Figure 4a that GONR and short GONR did not have a
discernible cytotoxic effect on HS68 cells. In previous reports, the
use of untested nanomaterials for cosmetic purposes could be considered
questionable,43,44 and it was usually due to the
attack of DNA after the nanoparticles entered the cells. After cytotoxicity
test, we found that our materials did not cause toxicity to normal
skin cells. We concluded that after nanomaterials entered the cells,
the nanomaterials just inhibit melanin production by decreasing the
oxidative stress and chelating metal ions and do not damage the mitochondria
or DNA, which means that MWCNTs and GONRs were safe to be used.

2.5 Two Types of MWCNTs and GONRs in B16–F10
Cellular Tyrosinase Activity and Melanin Content
In the melanin
synthesis pathway, tyrosinase plays a critical role. Tyrosinase oxidizes
and forms eumelanin and phenomelanin through a series of biochemical
reactions. In order to determine whether GONRs and MWCNTs inhibit
the activities of tyrosinase and cause a decrease in melanin production,
we analyzed the tyrosinase activity in B16–F10 cells. We found
that MWCNTs and short MWCNTs inhibited the tyrosinase activity by
approximately 17.1% and 23% at 10 mg/L. GONRs and short GONRs had
better effect in suppressing the tyrosinase activity at the same concentrations
compared to another GONR. They were also in a dose-dependent manner
and inhibited 49.8% and 44.7% of the tyrosinase activity, as shown
in Figure 4b.

Melanin is an indispensable pigment in the human body, but the overexpression
of melanin often triggers a series of diseases. In previous studies,
Xiao et al. used a similar material, Radical Sponge, a fullerene nanoparticle,
as an anti-melanin agent.45 There were
some good results; about 20% of melanin production could be inhibited.
In order to improve its efficiency, we further improved the testing
material to measure the inhibition rate of melanin and its molecular
mechanism, as shown in Figures 4c and 5. MWCNTs and short MWCNTs decreased
the melanin content by 17.6 ± 5.5 and 13.2 ± 0.2% at 10
mg/L and in a dose-dependent manner. GONRs and short GONRs powerfully
downregulated the values to 32.0 ± 2.3 and 35.3 ± 3.4% at
10 mg/L. The experimental results suggested that all four types could
inhibit the synthesis of melanin and GONRs had a stronger effect.
On the other hand, we have also observed that the short GONR has a
better effect in inhibiting the melanin production. We conclude that
the short GONRs has more functional groups and can effectively prevent
metal ions-catalyzed tyrosinase, further inhibiting the production
of melanin (Figure 2). In Table 1, we
observe that the effort of metal ion-chelating short type is higher
than the normal type; this means that these short GONRs could be potentially
applied in the cosmetic field as skin care agents.

μg/mL) of MWCNTs and GONRs. (a) RNA expressions. (b) Protein
expressions. All data points were done in triplicates (*P < 0.01; Student’s t-test).

2.6 Mechanism of MWCNTs and GONRs Inhibited the
B16–F10 Cellular Melanin Content
Cells respond to
the external oxidative stress by regulating the protein expression.
B16–F10 cells enhance c-myc gene expression
and up-regulated AMPK to decrease oxidative levels,46 and in this work, MITF is a specific transcription factor
of tyrosinase to regulate the molecular melanin synthesis signal pathway.47−49 In Figure 5a, MWCNTs
and GONRs downregulate the microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor by reducing the oxidative stress, and then, downstream gene
TRP-1 and TRP-2 were also downregulated. For the protein level, a
similar phenomenon was found, whereby MWCNTs and GONRs downregulated
the MITF-related melanogenesis pathway and then finally reduced the
melanin content (Figure 5b).

3 Experimental Materials and Methods
3.1 Preparation of MWCNTs and GONRs
The
relevant process for making GONRs was reported in a previous paper.12 MWCNT (0.05 g) was suspended in 9:1 H2SO4/H3PO4 and treated with a microwave
reactor (CEM-Discover) with the power set at 250 W for 2 min. After
the addition of KMnO4 (0.25 g) to the solutions, the solutions
were treated with the same microwave power at 65 °C for 4 min12 We then modified this process using a shorter
second-stage microwave time of 8 min by utilizing an air compressor.
Here, the air compressor is used to control the temperature of the
microwave reactor during the process. The microwave power was set
at 250 W in the preliminary tests.

3.2 Preparation
of Short MWCNTs and Short GONRs
The relevant process for
making short GONRs was reported in our
previous paper.34 The acidic treatment
time was chosen as 8 h. The microwave power was set at 250 W, which
is the same as that for getting GONRs.

3.3 DPPH
Radical Scavenging Activity
DPPH was frequently used to decide
the scavenging capacity of samples
and the antioxidation properties.50 DPPH
is a purple reagent that changes the color from purple to yellow if
the free radical is transferred to the analyte. Positive anti-oxidative
samples with suitable concentrations were added to the solution, and
the samples were analyzed at 517 nm for 30 min. We used the percentages
of the remaining DPPH besides the testing samples to measure the amount
of antioxidant required to reduce the previous DPPH radicals. Vitamin
C at 100 μM was used as the positive control. The scavenging
activity (%) was measured as 1  

3.4 Metal-Chelating Activity
Metal ion
is the factor that causes lipid excessive oxidation, and Fe2+ is one of the most influencing ions.50 Different concentrations of nanobiomaterial (1 μL) were loaded
into a 96-well plate, which contained 2 mM FeCl2·4H2O (10 μL), and then loaded into ferrozine (5 mM, 20
μL). The admixture was fully blended with 69 μL menthol
and kept at room temperature for 10 min. Then, the sample reaction
solution was observed at 562 nm. EDTA was used as a positive control
at 100 μM, and the metal-chelating activity calculation formula
was based on eq 1.

3.5 Reducing Power
The calculation of
reducing power is based on a previous study.50 First, 2.5 μL graphene materials was mixed with PBS buffer
(67 mM, pH 6.8) and K3Fe(CN)6 (2.5 μL,
20%) and then incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Then, 10% trichloro
acetic acid (160 μL) was blended with the reagents at 300g centrifuged for 20 min. The absorption length was determined
at 700 nm after being mixed with 25 μL FeCl3 (2%).
Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was used at 100 μM.

3.6 Cell Proliferation Examinations
The
human dermal fibroblasts cell line HS68 was employed to analyze the
ratio of cell proliferation. HS68 was incubated in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin and streptomycin mixed.50,51 After being
treated with different concentrations of samples, we applied MTT to
detect the cell proliferation ratio. 8000 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates and treated with samples for 24 h. The supernatant solution
was removed, and we used the MTT solution to culture for 2 h at 37
°C. After incubation, we removed the MTT-containing media and
dissolved it with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The solution was read
at OD 590 nm and the rate calculated by eq 1.

3.7 Assessment of Cellular
Melanin Contents
We used a method with minor modifications
based on the previous
assay.52,53 Cell pellets of B16–F10 from Bioresource
Collection and Research Center (BCRC, CRL 6323, Hsinchu, Taiwan) were
dissolved in a mixture of 2.0 N NaOH and 10% DMSO. The sample was
subsequently heated for 1 h at 90 °C and centrifuged at 10,000g for another 10 min to obtain the clarified supernatant.
The melanin count was determined by monitoring the OD of the supernatant
at 475 nm.

3.8 B16–F10 Cellular
Tyrosinase Activity
For the B16–F10 cellular tyrosinase
activity, we referred
to the previous work with some modifications.50 Cells were cultured in 12-well plates at 105 cells each
well. After treatments with samples, cells were lysed in 1% Triton
X-100/PBS and 2 mM l-tyrosine (50 μL) for 3 h. After
the incubation, we removed the media and read the absorbance at OD
590 nm. The tyrosinase activity formula was computed by eq 1.

3.9 Detection
of ROS by DCFDA Staining
Referring to the previous study,54 1.2
1.105 B16–F10 cells were seeded in 6-well plates
and treated with various concentrations of samples. Cells were suspended
in PBS and then loaded with DCFDA (5 μM) in non-phenol red DMEM
for 30 min at 37 °C. The flow cytometer (Guava, Merck, Germany)
was used to detect the fluorescent signal of DCFDA. Excitation and
emission wavelengths of DCFDA were 488 and 535 nm, respectively.

3.10 Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
We followed the methods of Lin et al. (2018).1 Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) consisted an exclusive primer probe to generate
fluorescence. It used a fluorescence detection technique that senses
each cycle using a 7500 qRT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA).
It detected the cycle based on the amount of fluorescence released,
and then the product of each cycle was calculated for the generated
content, which resulted in achieving real-time quantitative purposes.
Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) was used to extract a complete RNA of the
lung tissue, as per the direction given by the manufacturer. Subsequently,
a reverse transcription kit (Takara, Japan) was used to generate DNA.
In the qRT-PCR using primers, listed in Table 1, first, the sample was heated to form a
single strand of DNA; then a primer binding took place to form a double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA), after which SYBR Green dsDNA was combined, for which
the SYBR green plus reagent kit (Roche, Basel, Swiss) was used, which
resulted in releasing fluorescence. The resultant was passed through
a fluorescence detection system. The detection of fluorescent signals
took place during the elongation or annealing phase of each cycle;
after the detection, the sample contents were back-pushed by the detected
fluorescence intensities.55 The expression
levels of target genes were normalized to α-tubulin levels using
the 2–ΔΔCt method.

3.11 Western Blot Test
B16–F10
cells were lysed at 4 °C overnight with a radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (Thermo Scientific Co., USA), which contains protease
inhibitors. The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (BCA, Sigma-Aldrich
Corp., USA) was used to quantify the protein amount. Sample proteins
were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and
transferred on to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (PALL
Life Science, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The PVDF membrane was blocked with
a blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h and incubated with the
specific primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Next, the membrane
was washed with Tris buffered saline-Tween 20 buffer twice and incubated
with secondary antibodies for 1.5 h. After that, the membrane was
dipped into chemiluminescence detection reagents (Thermo Scientific)
and analyzed by a MiniChemi Chemiluminescence imager (Beijing Sage
Creation Science, China). Sources of antibodies included rabbit anti-MITF,
rabbit anti-TRP-1, rabbit anti-TRP-2, and β-actin (Thermo Scientific).

3.12 Material Analysis
TEM (JEOL JEM-1230,
100 kV) was utilized to observe the morphology of the nanocarbons.
A micro Raman spectrometer (PTT, RAMaker) was applied to check the
resonance modes of the nanocarbons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD) measurements were also carried out for
determining the compositional analysis.12,34

3.13 Statistical Analysis
All the samples
and standard experiments were repeated at least three times. We applied
the Student’s t-test to compare and express
the average of the mean values ± standard deviation statistically.

4 Conclusions
To sum up, we observed that the
short GONR was a potential material
for skin care production due to its multiple biofunctional properties
(Figure 6). The results
showed that the nanocarbons played a role as an extracellular and
intracellular antioxidant. Meanwhile, the nanocarbon inhibited the
tyrosinase activity and the melanin content and did not cause any
serious injury to pigment cells. This work established the anti-melanogenesis
functions of four types of nanocarbons; future studies will be examined
about the mechanism of these compounds on specific gene and protein
expressions related to melanin maturation, transportation, and accumulation.
