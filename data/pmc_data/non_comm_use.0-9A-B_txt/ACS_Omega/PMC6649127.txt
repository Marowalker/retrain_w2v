Computational modeling was applied
to far-infrared (FIR) spectra
of Pt-based anticancer drugs to study the hydrolysis of these important
molecules. Here, we present a study that investigates the influence
of different factors—basis sets on non-Pt atoms, relativistic
effective core potentials (RECPs) on the Pt atom, density functional
theory (DFT) functionals, and solvation models—on the prediction
of FIR spectra of two Pt-based anticancer drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin.
Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were performed with
a range of functionals (PBE, PBE0, M06-L, and M06-2X), Dunning’s
correlation-consisted basis sets (VDZ, VTZ, aVDZ, and aVTZ), RECPs
(VDZ-pp, VTZ-pp, aVDZ-pp, and aVTZ-pp), and solvation models (IEFPCM,
CPCM, and SMD). The best combination of the basis set/DFT functional/solvation
model was identified for each anticancer drug by comparing with experimentally
available FIR spectra. Different combinations were established for
cisplatin and carboplatin, which was rationalized by means of the
partial atomic charge scheme, ChelpG, that was utilized to study the
charge transfer between the Pt ion and ligands in both cisplatin and
carboplatin.

==== Body
Introduction
Since its discovery
by Rosenberg, cisplatin (Figure 1) has become one of the most commonly used
anticancer drugs.1,2 The chloride ion in cisplatin
helps to stabilize the drug before activation.3 After absorption via diffusion, cisplatin is activated by hydrolysis,
whereby the chloride ions are replaced with water molecules (Figure 1).4 The hydrolysis occurs as the drug passes from the blood
plasma to the cell cytoplasm, where the concentration of chloride
decreases.5 The activated form of cisplatin
interacts with the purine base on guanine of the DNA sequence to form
either mono- or bifunctional adducts, mostly by binding to two neighboring
guanines (G) or neighboring guanine and adenine (A).4−6 These adducts form cross-links between base pairs on the same helical
chain, resulting in the localized unwinding of the helix and increasing
the width of the minor groove.4,5,7 This disruption in structure thus interrupts the process of cell
replication and initiates apoptotic cell death.4,7 Currently,
there are uncertainties about the identity of the active form of cisplatin
and in particular whether it is mono- or diaquated. Kinetic studies
have indicated that the monoaquated complex is the active form; however,
in vitro studies have shown that the diaquated complex should be the
active form instead.5

Figure 1 Hydrolysis of cisplatin
to produce products that would form either
a mono- or bifunctional adduct with DNA.

The use of cisplatin in cancer treatments is accompanied
with a
number of harmful side effects, such as diminishing hearing ability,
nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, which results from the accumulation
of the active form of the drug in the body.2,8 This
has motivated the discovery of other Pt-based compounds with less
side effects to act as a substitute for cisplatin, like carboplatin
(Figure 2).2,4 Carboplatin has more complex functional groups based on cyclobutane,
and hence, it hydrolyzes at a slower rate compared to cisplatin (at
least 2 orders of magnitude slower), thus decreasing the rate of accumulation
and is therefore less toxic.2 The mechanism
of carboplatin, unlike cisplatin, involves a two-step ring opening
of the cyclobutanedicarboxylate group.9

Figure 2 Platinum-based
anticancer drugs. Cisplatin (left) and carboplatin
(right). Number on the complexes reflects the identity of the ligands
that are given in Tables 3 and 4.

Currently, there are still uncertainties with respect to
the mechanism
of how cisplatin and its derivatives hydrolyze prior to their binding
to DNA. There is evidence that the hydrolysis of cisplatin might be
a two-step process.6,10 Hambley et al. used [1H, 15N] heteronuclear single quantum coherence two-dimensional
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the kinetics of hydrolysis
of cisplatin and its binding to a 14 base pair oligonucleotide (5′-d(AATTAGTACTAATT)-3′).6 They identified
that cisplatin hydrolyzed first to the monoaquated form that subsequently
formed a covalent bond with the guanine base of the oligonucleotide
before it hydrolyzed to the diaquated form.6

Far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy has the potential to unravel
the
mechanistic detail of this process and is particularly useful for
investigating low-energy metal–ligand bonds. The FIR spectrum
of cisplatin and carboplatin allows us to understand the nature of
the donor–acceptor bonds whose stretching and bending vibrations
can only be detected between 10 and 600 cm–1.11,12 In addition, the FIR region can provide an insight into changes
of metal–ligand interactions and hence, their activity.4,12,13 This, in itself, has been a challenge
as reliable detection of the FIR region requires a bright light source,
normally absent in conventional benchtop instruments because of less
sensitive detectors, such as deuterated triglycine sulfate detectors.14 Because of this limitation, the FIR region of
both cisplatin and carboplatin was measured with a synchrotron source
that achieves high quality of spectra as the high brightness of FIR
protons provides a high signal-to-noise ratio in the FIR region.15

The characteristic FIR vibrations of cisplatin
and carboplatin
have been identified previously by comparing the experimental spectra
to those predicted with density functional theory (DFT).14,16,17 Wood et al. assigned main experimental
bands to be 155, 201, and 323 cm–1 for cisplatin
and 194, 348, 351, 441, 475, and 573 cm–1 for carboplatin.14 The presence of the heavy Pt cation increases
the difficulty of assignment of all the vibrations in the FIR region
because of band splitting.14,18−20 The heavy metal ion causes factor group splitting, a phenomenon
that arises from vibrational coupling interactions in molecules or
crystals, affecting the Pt–N vibrations.18−21 In addition, the presence of
intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the complex molecules may
also contribute to splitting of the stretching Pt–Cl and Pt–N
bands.11

The two Pt-based complexes—cisplatin
and carboplatin—studied
here possess donor–acceptor bonds between the Pt(II) ion and
ligands, with Pt playing the role of an acceptor. These bonds are
different from normal covalent bonds. The study by Wysokiński
et al. reported results of the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
for both cisplatin and carboplatin. It was found that the lone pair
on the donor N atoms of cisplatin exhibits at least 85.3% p-type character
and has occupancy of 1.719e, whereas the N atoms
on carboplatin exhibit 81.5% p-type character.22 This indicates that there is a partial π-back donation
to Pt orbitals, which is more apparent in carboplatin.22

Luo et al. applied LC-ωPBE, mPW1PW,
and PBE0 functionals,
specifically DFT, to conduct structural, IR, and molecular orbital
studies of two conformations of Pt(NH3)2Cl2—cisplatin and transplatin.23 Analysis of the electrostatic potential on the two complexes revealed
that cisplatin was more susceptible to nucleophilic attack compared
to transplatin.23 This conclusion further
supports the observation that transplatin was inactive as an anticancer
drug, on top of the inability of transplatin to form bifunctional
adducts with DNA.24−26 Wysokiński et al. compared the calculated
spectra of carboplatin, using mPW1PW91 and MP2 methods with either
LanL2DZ, D95V(d,p), and D95V++(d,p) basis sets in gas, to experimental
data and identified the characteristic stretching and bending modes
of carboplatin.27 It was concluded that
the mPW1PW91/LanL2DZ level of theory predicted the experimental spectra
to be the best out of the combinations studied.27 In addition, a study conducted by Barone et al. indicates
the validity of DFT as a tool to study the Raman spectroscopy of cisplatin.28 IR spectra calculated with the B3PW91-D3 and
B2PLYP-D3 functionals were compared with the experimental spectra.28 Mean absolute deviations (MADs) of 41 and 45
cm–1 were reported for these functionals.28 The MAD decreased to 15 cm–1 when an anharmonic force field was used. It should be pointed out
that in this case, MADs were applied to the full spectrum. On closer
inspection of the data, the harmonic oscillator performed equally
well in the FIR region.28 Moreover, the
results were computed in the gas phase, thus additionally affecting
the quality of the prediction.28

Since donor–acceptor bonds are special types of covalent
bonds, accurate quantum chemical methods are required to predict their
properties.14,27,29−31 The Pt–N bond in cisplatin has been proven
to be difficult to model in previous studies, with B3LYP resulting
in a longer Pt–N bond length and thus underestimating the stretching
frequency.29−31 For example, DFT functionals, such as B3LYP and B3PW91,
have been shown to produce inconsistent results in determining geometries
and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the B→N dative bond.29 The study also demonstrated that MPW1K, a hybrid
functional, consistently underestimated the BDE of the B→N
bond by a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 4.1 kcal mol–1 on average, producing the best results out of the tested functionals
(PBE and mPW1PW91 giving rise to RMSDs of 4.5 and 5.1 kcal mol–1, respectively).29 Another
study by Philips et al. indicated that it was challenging to identify
a suitable DFT functional to predict IR spectra of a nitrile→BH3 complex because of the presence of the dative bond.30

Despite these shortcomings, DFT still
represents the most computationally
feasible approach to studying these bonds. FIR spectroscopy represents
the most definitive indirect technique in probing the mode of donor–acceptor
bonding in Pt-based anticancer drugs and thus, aid in unraveling their
mechanism of action in the cell. Therefore, it is important to know
limitations of current DFT functionals in the prediction of FIR spectra
of these drugs. To date, no systematic study has been performed on
the accuracy of DFT functionals for the prediction of stretching and
bending vibrations of Pt–ligand bonds. It is particularly important
to establish which DFT functionals are reliable for the prediction
of stretching vibrations as these are more likely to be affected by
the accuracy of the selected functional as well as the inclusion of
solvent effects, whereas bending vibrations might not be as sensitive.32,33 The dependency of stretching vibrations on the chosen functional
was demonstrated in a study conducted by Wysokiński and Michalska,
in which different DFT functionals resulted in underestimation of
Pt–N stretching vibrations in cisplatin.33 Although a number of theoretical strategies have been applied
to offset systematic errors in the predicted frequencies (e.g., the
application of scaling factors), different strategies might need to
be applied for stretching and bending vibrations in the case of Pt–ligand
dative bonds.34,35 In particular, electrostatic
effects of the bulk on predicted spectra were not considered in the
reported studies on Pt-based anticancer drugs.

In this work,
we have performed a systematic study analyzing the
accuracy and reliability of a series of DFT functionals (PBE, PBE0,
M06-L, and M06-2X), Dunning’s correlation consistent basis
sets (VDZ, VTZ, aVDZ, and aVTZ), relativistic effective core potentials
(RECPs) for Pt (VDZ-pp, VTZ-pp, aVDZ-pp, and aVTZ-pp), and solvation
models (IEFPCM, CPCM, and SMD) for the prediction of experimental
FIR spectra of cisplatin and carboplatin. The M06-L functional with
no contribution from exact Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange was selected
as it was originally designed to study transition metal complexes,36 whereas PBE is traditionally used for studying
metal surfaces.37 Instead of Grimme’s
empirical dispersion correction,38 the
use of hybrid functionals such as PBE0 and M06-2X was adopted as the
inclusion of the exact HF exchange was shown to reliably treat noncovalent
interactions.39,40 Although there are a number of
RECPs available,41−45 RECPs developed by Peterson et al.46 were
selected for the Pt atom because of their superior description of
the valence electrons. These potentials showed excellent performance
against the benchmark method, CCSDTQ, for the atomic properties of
5d elements.46 Geometry optimizations and
frequency calculations were performed on cisplatin and carboplatin,
respectively, using different combinations of the DFT functionals,
basis sets, and solvation models. The previously characteristic experimental
peaks of both platinum complexes were used as a reference to the predicted
spectra. The optimal combination of the functional, basis set, and
solvation model to predict the experimental spectra was identified.
In addition, the effect of each factor was also analyzed to determine
the extent of its influence on the predicted spectra and stretching
vibrations of Pt−ligand bonds in particular. Last, charges
from electrostatic potentials grid method (ChelpG) analysis were performed
on both cisplatin and carboplatin to study the electrostatic potential
of the Pt metal ion and ligands and the differences between the two
different complexes.

Theoretical Procedures
All molecular
orbital calculations were performed using the Gaussian
09 quantum chemical package. Both complexes of interest, cisplatin
and carboplatin, were subjected to geometry optimization, followed
by a frequency calculation. For both complexes, the Pt cation center
has a square planar (C2v) symmetry.31,33,34 Carboplatin has a similar geometry, with the Cl– anions being replaced with the cyclobutanedicarboxylate group.1,2,27

Four different DFT functionals
were chosen for this study: PBE,37 M06-L,36 PBE0,39 and M06-2X.40 PBE
is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional developed
by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof.37 PBE0,
a hybrid functional developed by Adamo, builds on the PBE functional
to include 25% HF exchange energy.39 HF
exchange energy improves the accuracy of chemical property predictions,
for example, atomization energies and ionization potentials, of small-
to medium-sized systems, especially for noncovalent interactions and
excited states.47−49 Upon the addition of the 25% HF exchange energy,
PBE0 is comparable to other more heavily parameterized functionals
for the prediction of structures and molecular properties, such as
kinetic and thermodynamic properties.39,49 M06-L and
M06-2X are Minnesota functionals, with the former being a meta-GGA
functional and the latter being a hybrid meta-GGA functional.36,40 M06-L, a local density functional, takes into consideration the
local spin density, the local spin gradient, as well as the spin kinetic
energy density.31,36 This allows M06-L to provide
higher efficiency for larger systems, specifically to study the thermodynamics
of transition metal complexes.36 In addition,
being a local density functional, M06-L has been successfully benchmarked
for the MLBE21/05 database containing organometallic and inorganometallic
complexes, such as CrCH3+ and Fe(CO), to reproduce
the benchmark data within 5.4 kcal mol–1 on average
for transition metal–ligand bond energies. M06-L has also been
benchmarked for intermolecular hydrogen bonds using the HB6/04 database,
which contains hydrogen-bonded complexes such as dimers of ammonia
and water, with M06-L predicting the smallest mean unsigned error
of 0.36 kcal mol–1.36 M06-2X contains 54% of HF exchange and was formulated to meet five
different criteria, including the description of noncovalent interactions,
transition metal bonding, and electronic spectroscopy predictions.40 M06-2X has also been successfully benchmarked
for the πTC13 and TME53 databases consisting of varying complexes
with π–π stacking interactions and ionization potentials,
producing mean unsigned errors of 1.40 and 2.54 kcal mol–1, respectively.40

The two complexes
of interest were studied using different implicit
solvation models: integral equation formalism polarizable continuum
model (IEFPCM),50 conductor-like polarizable
continuum model (CPCM),51 and solute model
based on density (SMD),52 with water as
the solvent. These implicit solvation models place the molecule of
interest into a cavity, whose surface charge is stabilized in accordance
with the dielectric constant of the selected solvent, thus simulating
the effect of the solute being exposed to the solvent.52,53 Both IEFPCM and CPCM apply the dielectric permittivity, ε,
of the solvent as a uniform medium with the solute placed in a cavity.50,51,54 The difference between IEFPCM
and CPCM lies in the method used to define the cavity. IEFPCM makes
the use of connected spheres to model the solute, with radii of the
spheres matching those of solute atoms.50,54 The uniform
dielectric permittivity of the solvent acts on the wavefunction of
the modeled solute.50 CPCM, on the other
hand, makes the use of unique, small regions on these connected spheres
called tesserae.51 These tesserae are defined
by their individual position and interaction with the dielectric constant.51 Partial charges are then assigned to each of
the tesserae based on the electrostatic potential. SMD is a model
that makes use of a smooth continuous model to assign charges on the
molecular surface of the solute.52 For
SMD, the solute is polarizable by the charge density of the solvent
and the interaction between the solute and solvent can be determined
via the charge density of the former and the electric polarization
field of the latter.52 In addition, SMD
has proven to be an effective solvation model for use in both charged
and uncharged systems and is able to predict accurate solvation energies
for various different functional groups, achieving an average of mean
absolute error of 4 kcal mol–1 for ions.52

RECPs were employed on the Pt atom to
model the inner core electrons
to reduce computational costs.46,55 Developed by Peterson
et al., these RECPs were taken from multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock
calculations for 5d elements that also explicitly included relativistic
effects.46 RECPs are regularly used to
model heavy atoms as they aid to decrease computational costs and
already take relativistic effects into consideration.41,56 In a study conducted by Xu and Truhlar, a range of RECPs, cc-pVxZ-pp
(x = D, T, Q, 5), LANL2DZ, and MDF28, were utilized to investigate
the dissociation energy of diatomic molecules, for example, As2 and AsFe.41 They determined that
the relativistic ECPs developed by Peterson et al. performed the best,
with VTZ-pp producing an average mean unsigned error of 1.1 kcal mol–1.41 In this study, the
RECPs used for the Pt metal ion are VDZ-pp, VTZ-pp, aVDZ-pp, and aVTZ-pp.

A series of Dunning’s basis sets—VDZ, VTZ, aVDZ,
and aVTZ—were chosen for this study, enabling the systematic
approximation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit.57 Augmented basis sets, aVDZ and aVTZ, were also considered
because of their superior treatment of induction interactions.57

This study aims to identify the optimal
combination of the functional,
basis set for the non-Pt atoms, RECP for the Pt metal ion, and solvation
model to predict the experimental FIR spectra of Pt complexes. The
statistical tools used in this study are the mean deviation, denoted
as mean, standard deviation (SD), and the MAD. The mean denotes how
accurate the predicted spectra are to the experimental spectra. MAD
is calculated with eq 1 and indicates the spread of the peaks calculated in the predicted
spectra when compared to the experimental spectra. SD is calculated
with eq 2. 1   2  where vi and ωi are experimental
and calculated wavenumber values, respectively, and n is the number of peaks compared.

In the following figures,
the MAD is represented by the horizontal
line in the box plot, as seen in Figure 3. The MAD is used to demonstrate the deviation
of predicted peaks to the experimental peaks. The upper and lower
quantile of the box is the SD about the MAD, and the whiskers represent
the spread of twice the SD about the MAD. In this analysis, it is
preferred that MAD to be as close to zero as possible and the box
to be as narrow as possible.

the deviation of
the predicted peaks to the experimental peaks.

Results and Discussion
The calculated results in this study
are compared to the previously
experimentally measured spectra.14,31Tables 1 and 2 present the characteristic peaks of both cisplatin and carboplatin,
respectively. Each peak is assigned to a specific type of vibration
observed in the FIR region.

and experimental peaks were calculated for each combination of the
DFT functional/basis set/solvent model.

In order to make an unbiased assignment of the predicted
spectra
to experiential bands, for each predicted peak the differences to
all experimental wavenumber values were calculated. The smallest difference
dictated the assignment of the predicted band to the corresponding
experimental band. An independent assignment was performed this way
for four varying conditions—DFT functional, basis set on non-Pt
atoms, RECP basis set on Pt, and solvent model. An example of predicted
and experimental band alignment is shown in Figure 4, in which the RECP basis set varied from
VDZ-pp to aVTZ-pp. In order to assess the performance of each DFT
functional/basis set/solvent model combination, mean and MAD values
were computed. Additionally, these statistical measures were used
to ensure that the correct band assignment was achieved.

alignment of the three characteristic peaks of cisplatin
to predicted spectra. Spectra were obtained with the PBE functional
in the gas phase combined with the VDZ basis set on non-Pt atoms.
RECPs on Pt are given on the left top corner of each spectrum.

In the case of cisplatin, two
predicted peaks would manifest in
the 335–355 cm–1 region, with the peak with
the lower wavenumber corresponding to νasym(Pt–Cl)
and the higher wavenumber corresponding to νsym(Pt–Cl).14,17 In the experimental data, only one broad peak was detected, an overlapping
of both the symmetric and asymmetric Pt–Cl stretch.14,17 In this case, the closer predicted peak out of the two (symmetric
and asymmetric) was taken into consideration for peak allocation.
Despite being represented by one broad peak in the experimental data,
the two different types of stretching—symmetric and asymmetric—manifest
at slightly different wavenumber values.

The 249 cm–1 peak that is found in the experimental
spectra was initially assigned to the NH3–Pt–NH3 bending vibration arising from the cisplatin dimer.17 In this study, we focus on the vibrations that
represent the Pt-based complex monomers and, therefore, this peak
was not considered.

The same assignment process was performed
for carboplatin, as shown
in Figure 5. It was
noted that there are a few weak peaks detected at 230, 248, and 320
cm–1. Some of these peaks were originally assigned
to bending/stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups. For example,
the band located at 320 cm–1 was assigned to a rocking
vibration of the cyclobutanedicarboxylate group.27 It was outside the scope of this study to investigate these
types of vibrations, and therefore, these peaks were not considered.

of alignment of the five characteristic peaks of carboplatin
to predicted spectra. Spectra were obtained with the PBE functional
in the gas phase combined with the VDZ basis set on non-Pt atoms.
RECPs on Pt are given on the left top corner of each spectrum.

Further in the text, we look at
each of the four criteria for both
cisplatin and carboplatin separately to identify the best combination
to predict FIR spectra for each compound.

Selection of Effective
Core Potential on Pt and Basis Set on
Non-Pt Atoms for Cisplatin
The SD values calculated for the
four DFT functionals in the gas phase are shown in Figure 6 by varying the basis sets
applied for both Pt and non-Pt atoms. Analysis of Figure 6 reveals that apart from the
PBE0 functional, the SD values fall in a narrow range of 13.5–23.0
cm–1. PBE0 produces slightly larger errors of up
35.0 cm–1. On the other hand, the effect of the
basis sets of both Pt and non-Pt atoms appears to be very minimal.
This was studied by taking the maximum difference in both MAD and
SD (labeled as ± further in the text) when different RECP and
basis sets were applied. For example, the maximum difference in MAD
when the VDZ basis set was applied for the non-Pt atoms is 19.0 ±
19.2 cm–1 and the maximum difference when VDZ-pp
RECP was applied for the Pt ion is 18.7 ± 20.31 cm–1. The maximum differences of the different basis sets and RECPs were
4.0 ± 4.25 and 2.0 ± 3.6 cm–1, respectively.
The VTZ-pp RECP basis set for Pt was found to produce the smallest
MAD values in the range of 15.6–21.5 cm–1, for all functionals except PBE0, regardless of the choice of basis
set on non-Pt atoms.

and basis

line) and SD values (upper and lower quantile of box) of PBE, M06-L,
PBE0, and M06-2X DFT functionals used on gas-phase optimized geometries
of cisplatin. All values given in cm−1.

In order to select the best-performing basis set
for non-Pt atoms,
the performance of the four DFT functionals was compared while keeping
the VTZ-pp RECP basis set constant for the Pt atom. The corresponding
MAD and SD values are presented in a box and whisker plot in Figure 7. These box and whisker
plots give an indication of the spread of the calculated peaks about
the characteristic experimental peaks. Ideally, a combination of the
MAD close to zero and a narrow distribution in SD indicates the best
performance of the method.

basis sets (x-axis) on non-Pt atoms on the performance
of DFT functionals
using gas-phase optimized geometries of cisplatin and the VTZ-pp RECP
basis set on Pt. All values given in cm−1.

Analysis of Figure 7 reveals that the increasing basis set on
non-Pt atoms does not alter
the performance of the DFT functionals, with triple-ζ quality
basis sets giving marginally larger errors compared to double-ζ
ones. Out of these, the PBE0 functional was found to exhibit the largest
MAD and SD values of 25.0 and 33.3 cm–1, respectively.
The MAD and SD values of PBE, M06-L, and M06-2X functionals are as
follows: 15.0 ± 21.5, 11.0 ± 20.0, and 11.0 ± 18.4
cm–1. Out of the four functionals, M06-L and M062X
give the MAD values closer to zero, with the former producing slightly
smaller SD values of 15.6 cm–1 for the VDZ basis
set. To this end, the VDZ basis set was established to be the optimal
basis set for non-Pt atoms in the gas phase regardless of the DFT
functional. Further in the text, only results calculated with the
VDZ basis set on non-Pt atoms and the VTZ-pp RECP basis set on Pt
are discussed for cisplatin.

The effect of solvent model is
shown in a box and whisker plot
in Figure 8, in which
the VDZ basis set was used for non-Pt atoms and the VTZ-pp RECP basis
set for Pt. Analysis of these results reveals that the choice of functionals
and solvation models plays a significant role in the prediction of
the characteristic FIR wavenumbers of cisplatin. Some functionals
are affected more than the others. For example, the PBE0 functionals
show the largest reduction in the MAD and SD values going from the
gas phase to SMD. The MAD and SD values for PBE0 decreased from 24.3
± 32.6 to 5.0 ± 9.3 cm–1 from the gas
phase to SMD. The Minnesota functionals undergo the least changes,
with M062X giving the largest MAD errors of 19.7 and 20.7 cm–1 in combination with the IEFPCM and CPCM models, respectively. The
SMD model appears to produce the lowest MAD and SD errors for all
four DFT functionals, with PBE showing the MAD value as low as 5.7
cm–1. These results identify the importance of selecting
an optimal combination of solvent model and DFT functional for studying
donor–acceptor bonds in Pt-based complexes because of their
polar properties58 as well as the π-back
donation of lone pairs on N/Cl atoms to unoccupied orbitals on Pt.59 It was previously hypothesized that the π-back
donation could dictate the characteristic of the Pt–N bond.59 It has been shown previously that increasing
the polarity of the solvent (from C6H6 to CH3CN) has a stabilizing effect on the donor–acceptor
bond in the previously studied compounds such as polyenes.58,60,61

Out of the three FIR bands identified from the experimental
spectrum
of cisplatin, there is only one stretching vibration observed at 323
cm–1. It has been previously reported that both
stretching and bending vibrations are usually overestimated when calculated
using HF or DFT methods in the gas phase.62 This was also previously observed in a cisplatin study conducted
by Wang et al., where the IR spectra were calculated in the gas phase
using LC-ωPBE functional, 6-311++G** basis set on the non-Pt
atoms, and SDD ECP on the Pt ion in both the gas phase and SMD solvation
model with water as the solvent.23 A calculation
performed in the gas phase predicted that the Pt–Cl bond length
is shorter by 0.035 Å and the Pt–N bond length is longer
by 0.076 Å compared with the experimental data.23 Both Pt–Cl and Pt–N stretching vibrations
were overestimated, and a scaling factor of 0.95 was applied to the
spectra.23 As the SMD solvation model was
utilized in the optimization of cisplatin, it decreases the error
in predicted bond lengths— Pt–N is 0.037 Å and
Pt–Cl is 0.006 Å longer than the experimental data.23 The absence of the solvation field has proven
to decrease the accuracy in predicting the geometry of cisplatin and,
therefore, the IR spectrum.23 Stretching
vibrations also appear to be more sensitive to the choice of level
of theory because of their increased strength compared to that of
bending ones.62 As expected, the stretching
vibration is overestimated by 32 cm−1 for the combination
of PBE0 and the gas phase. This stretching vibration becomes underestimated
with the inclusion of solvation models by as much as 33 cm–1 with M06-2X and CPCM solvation model, with two exceptions (PBE0
functional with IEFPCM and SMD solvation model where the stretching
vibration is overestimated by 5 and 1 cm–1, respectively).
The bending vibrations were usually overestimated, with PBE0 functional
in the gas phase giving the largest SD of 33.2 cm–1. It was observed that γ bending vibrations were consistently
overestimated when compared to the 155 cm–1 experimental
peak, with the largest deviation of 15 cm–1 being
produced with the PBE functional and the IEFPCM. α bending vibrations,
an in-plane scissoring vibration that is represented by the 201 cm–1 experimental peak, is considerably less consistent
as compared to the prediction of γ bending, which is an out-of-plane
bending vibration, with a combination of both over- and underestimation.
The largest underestimation and overestimation of the α bending
vibrations resulted with PBE0 in gas (32 cm–1) and
M06L with SMD (13 cm–1), respectively. In the case
of cisplatin, the absolute deviations of the only stretching vibration
in cisplatin are shown in Figure 9. Upon comparison of Figures 8 and 9, the main contribution
of MAD in Figure 8 is
due to the MAD that arose from the stretching vibration. For example,
the use of PBE0 in conjunction with the gas phase resulted in the
large MAD of stretching vibration, 32.0 cm–1, and
a large overall MAD, of 24.3 cm–1, when all three
experimental peaks were compared. In other cases, with M06-2X functional
and solvation models, the MAD recorded for the stretching vibration
is between 30.0 and 33.0 cm–1. The stretching vibration
has the biggest contribution to the MAD when compared to all three
experimental peaks. Overall, the PBE and PBE0 functionals reproduce
the stretching vibration in cisplatin within as low as 1 cm–1 when combined with the SMD solvation model. The MAD values for these
functionals (see Figure 8) come entirely from overestimation of the two bending vibrations.

errors (in cm–1) of solvation models
and functionals for the prediction of the cisplatin stretching vibration

In the case of cisplatin, the combination of the SMD solvation
model and the PBE functional appears to be the optimal combination
to predict its FIR spectrum.

Selection of Effective Core Potential on
Pt and Basis Set on
Non-Pt Atoms for Carboplatin
As in the case of cisplatin,
the effect of the basis set applied for non-Pt atoms was found to
be minimal (see Figure 10). The PBE0 functional has been demonstrated to give rise
to the larger range of SD values, a minimum of 20.0 cm–1, among the four functionals. Excluding PBE0, the SD values of the
other three functionals lie between a smaller range of 8.7–15.7
cm–1. The maximum SD values were found to be 14.5
cm–1 for the aVDZ basis set on the non-Pt atoms
and 13.9 cm–1 with the aVTZ-pp RECP on the Pt ion.
The change in SD values across basis sets and RECPs was 0.8 and 0.4
cm–1, respectively. The maximum MAD values were
found to be 11.4 and 13.0 cm–1 for the aVTZ basis
set and aVTZ-pp RECP, respectively. The variation in MAD values across
basis sets and RECPs fell in the region of 1.6 and 2.7 cm–1. As for cisplatin, the effect of the RECP basis set on Pt on the
carboplatin vibrations was small, with VTZ-pp showing the best trade-off
between accuracy and cost as demonstrated in Figure 11 (MAD values between 5.8 and 9.8 cm–1 excluding PBE0). The VDZ basis set was again sufficient
for non-Pt atoms, where the VTZ-pp RECP was the best option for the
Pt atom.

sets on the non-Pt atoms (x-axis) on the MAD (horizontal
line) and SD values (upper and lower quantile of box) of PBE, M06-L,
PBE0, and M06-2X functionals used on gas-phase optimized geometries
of carboplatin. All values given in cm−1.

of basis set (x-axis) on non-Pt atoms on the performance
of DFT functionals
using gas-phase optimized geometries of carboplatin and VTZ-pp RECP
basis set carboplatin. All values given in cm−1.

In the case of carboplatin, it
is evident that the influence of
solvation model and functional (see Figure 12) is different when compared to that of
cisplatin. Out of all combinations tested, the M06-L functional together
with CPCM produced the least MAD and SD values of 6.8 and 9.1 cm–1, respectively. Surprisingly, the PBE0 functional
in combination with the SMD model generated the largest errors, with
MAD and SD being 19.0 and 30.5 cm–1, respectively,
which is in contrast to the trend found in cisplatin. M06-2X produced
second best results, apart from the SMD model. Overall, the Minnesota
functionals performed better for carboplatin than for cisplatin. This
striking difference might be attributed to the differences between
the description of the donor–acceptor bonds present in the
two complexes: Pt–Cl bond versus the Pt–O bond. Analysis
of the atomic charges fitted to reproduce the electrostatic potential
using the ChelpG, it was confirmed that the Pt–Cl bond had
more covalent characteristics compared to the Pt–O bond. For
gas-phase optimized geometries, the predicted charges on the Cl atoms
in cisplatin and O atoms in carboplatin are approximately −0.7e and −1.5e, respectively. This
trend is further supported by the charges on Pt atoms, which were
predicted to be 1.8e and 2.1e for
cisplatin and carboplatin, respectively. Solvent-phase optimized geometries
produced similar trends as discussed below. The partial charge on
the chloride and charge on Pt < 2.0e in cisplatin
clearly demonstrate a charge transfer on the Pt–Cl bond of
0.3e. In the case of carboplatin, there does not
seem to be a charge transfer between the Pt and O atoms. This observation
explains why M06-L performs better for carboplatin and PBE performs
better for cisplatin. The outstanding performance of M06-L is expected
as the functional was developed for treating transition metal complexes.36 As mentioned before, PBE is a GGA functional
that is an improvement to the local density approximation and is able
to better describe covalent bonds compared to M06-L.36,37,63

of solvent models (x-axis) on the performance of
DFT functionals of carboplatin
using the VTZ-pp RECP basis set on Pt and VDZ basis set on non-Pt-atoms.
All values given in cm−1.

In the carboplatin case, there are three pure stretching
vibrations
out of six (located at 348, 351, and 441 cm–1) and
a peak (located at 475 cm–1) that has both stretching
and bending contributions assigned experimentally in the FIR region.
The MAD and SD values for the stretching vibrations are given in Figure 13. The stretching
vibrations of carboplatin are not as consistently underestimated as
compared to those cisplatin, noting that these vibrations usually
manifest as a mixture of vibrations. For example, the theoretical
bands at 341 and 352 cm–1 assigned to the ν(Pt–O)
vibration are usually coupled with bending vibrations of the cyclobutanedicarboxylate
side group. The experimental peak at 441 cm–1 that
has been assigned to a pure Pt–N symmetric vibration is usually
accompanied by a Pt–O bending vibration. These mixtures of
vibrations resulted in the inconsistent over- and underestimation
of the measured peaks, with the exception for the PBE0 functional
that always results in an overestimation of all four characteristic
peaks in the range of 85 cm–1 with the CPCM/IEFPCM
solvation model to 99 cm–1 with the SMD solvation
model. With the exception of PBE0, ν(Pt–O) is more prone
to be underestimated as compared to ν(Pt–N). Both ν(Pt–O)
experimental peaks (348 and 351 cm–1) were only
overestimated with the M06-2X functional in the gas phase. ν(Pt–N)
experimental peaks at 441 and 475 cm–1, on the other
hand, were found to be overestimated with a few exceptions. For example,
M06-L and M06-2X functionals in the gas phase underestimate the 441
cm–1 experimental peak by 26 and 7 cm–1, respectively. As one can see, the MAD and SD values practically
reflect those in Figure 12, identifying a similar trend observed for cisplatin, with
larger errors arising from stretching vibrations. The M06-L functional
produces the least errors when combined with the IEFPCM and CPCM models,
whereas the PBE0 functional gives the largest errors regardless of
the solvent model used.

Figure 13 Absolute errors (in cm–1)
of solvation models
and functionals for the prediction of the carboplatin stretching vibrations
at 348, 351, 441, and 475 cm–1.

In addition, the bending vibrations of carboplatin and the
experimental
wavenumber of 194 and 573 cm–1 were also studied.
The peaks at 194 and 573 cm–1 were assigned to α(N–Pt–N)
and α(O–Pt–O), respectively. Interestingly, the
O–Pt–O bending vibration at 573 cm–1 was underestimated regardless of the functional and solvation model,
with the PBE and SMD combination giving rise to the largest deviation
of 31 cm–1. The smallest deviation of 2 cm–1 was obtained with the M06-2X functional in the gas phase. This could
be due to the absence of a pure bending vibration. The presence of
a more complex cyclobutanedicarboxylate group in carboplatin appears
to play a role in these predictions.

Comparison of the predicted
stretching vibrations of cisplatin
and carboplatin, excluding the PBE0 functional that consistently produces
large MAD and SD values, shows a range of MAD values from 0 cm–1 with the PBE functional and the SMD solvation model
to 33 cm–1 with the M06-2X functional and the CPCM
solvation model for cisplatin. For carboplatin, the MAD and SD (denoted
as MAD ± SD) values are 7.0 ± 9.4 and 16.5 ± 21.3 cm–1 both with PBE functional in the gas phase and SMD,
respectively. These results highlight that a different scaling factor
is needed not only for each DFT functional but also for their combination
with a solvent model.

Analysis of bending vibrations of both
complexes was compared.
The range of MAD and SD for bending vibrations of both cisplatin and
carboplatin is significantly narrower compared to that of stretching
vibrations. The range of MAD and SD values for cisplatin lies between
4 ± 5.8 and 22.5 ± 32.5 cm–1 for cisplatin
and between 4.0 ± 7.1 and 17.5 ± 31.3 cm–1 for carboplatin. As mentioned above, the γ bending vibrations
present in cisplatin were always overestimated, and the prediction
of α bending vibrations was less consistent. Therefore, universal
scaling factors cannot be obtained if both stretching and two types
of bending vibrations are to be accurately predicted.

Correlation
between Pt–Ligand Bond Length and FIR Vibrations
It
is well-known that there exists a direct correlation between
the bond length and its strength.64Figure 14 presents the relationship
between the predicted Pt–Cl bond length and corresponding stretching
vibration.

Figure 14 Relationship between the Pt–Cl bond length and
the predicted
Pt–Cl stretching vibration. The vertical line represents the
Pt–Cl stretching experimental peak (323 cm–1) and the horizontal line represents the Pt–Cl bond length
determined using X-ray data (2.331 Å).

Analysis of Figure 14 confirms a linear relationship between the Pt–Cl bond
length
and the predicted wavelength. It has become very evident that the
gas phase makes the bond shorter in a very narrow range of 2.29–2.36
Å for the four functionals studied. Inclusion of a solvent model
stretched the bond by 0.034 Å on average for the PBE and PBE0
functionals and by 0.053 Å on average for the Minnesota functionals.
The latter produce the longest Pt–Cl bond. The nature of the
solvent model varies the bond length only slightly. The PBE and PBE0
functionals in combination with all three solvent models seem to find
a nice fit to produce accurate prediction for the Pt–Cl stretching
vibration, whereas the Minnesota functionals seem to underestimate
it. These results further support the previous finding that in this
case each DFT functional/solvent combination requires its individual
scaling coefficient. Moreover, the gas phase results overestimate
the stretching vibration in the range of 1 cm–1 for
the M06-L functional and 32 cm–1 for the PBE0 functional
as a result of a rather short Pt–Cl bond, thus highlighting
the importance of inclusion of a solvent model for Pt-based complexes.

In the case of carboplatin data shown in Figure 15, one can see that while the prediction
of both Pt–O1 and Pt–O2 wavenumber values does not deviate
significantly (in the range of 332–361 cm–1 for Pt–O1 and 343–372 cm–1 for Pt–O2),
the prediction of the Pt–O bond lengths is generally underestimated
by 0.061 Å on average. Both wavenumber values and Pt–N
bond lengths are mostly overestimated up to 99 cm–1 and 0.0865 Å, respectively. Similar to cisplatin, both Pt–O
and Pt–N bond lengths are predicted to be short when calculated
in the gas phase, with a range of 1.96–2.00 Å for Pt–O
and 2.08–2.11 Å for Pt–N. With the inclusion of
solvation models, the bond lengths increased slightly by 0.030 Å
on average for Pt–O with PBE and PBE0 functionals and 0.043
Å on average with the Minnesota functionals. However, the Pt–N
bond decreased by 0.026 Å with PBE and PBE0 functionals and 0.039
Å with the Minnesota functionals. The inclusion of solvation
better predicted the Pt–ligand bond lengths when compared to
X-ray data. Although the choice of functionals and solvation model
does not affect the prediction of the Pt–O stretching vibrations
significantly, it plays a larger role for the Pt–N stretching
vibrations. For example, the PBE0 functional in conjunction with SMD
overestimates both Pt–N vibrations by a minimum of 26 cm–1. M06-L and either IEFPCM or CPCM reproduce the Pt–N
experimental peaks the closest within 7 cm–1, supporting
the above conclusion that the Minnesota functionals perform well for
systems containing transition metals.36,40

Analysis of Partial Atomic
Charges with ChelpG
NBO
analysis, as mentioned above, is a definitive tool in providing information
about the electronic charge distribution, type of bond, and charge
transfer in a molecular system.65,66 However, the application
of the NBO method proved to be an issue in this study because of the
orbital inversion that was attributed to incorrect reading of the
RECPs used. Instead, the ChelpG analysis, combined with the HF method
VDZ basis set on non-Pt atoms and VTZ-pp on Pt, was used to study
partial atomic charges by fitting these to reproduce the electrostatic
potential of complexes.67−70 ChelpG developed by Cox and William was demonstrated
the ability of atomic charge assignment to explain molecular properties
such as dipole moments.68 ChelpG, a grid-based
method, utilizes points spaced by 0.3–0.8 Å, placed at
the center of the atoms, to imitate the electrostatic potential surface
of a molecular system.68−70 ChelpG removes any points that are located in the
van der Waals radius of all atoms because of the influence of being
in close proximity to the nucleus. The ionic radius selected for Pt(II)
was 0.8 Å.71 The van der Waals radii
used for the other atoms are the default values defined in the ChelpG
scheme.69,70Table 3 shows partial atomic charges
calculated for cisplatin and carboplatin, whereas Table 4 presents the overall charges on the ligands. In cisplatin,
the charges on the Cl anion were found to be significantly less negative
than those of the N atom. For example, when calculated with PBE in
the gas phase, the atomic charges of Cl and N were computed to be
−0.707e and −2.652e, respectively. The overall charge of the NH3 ligand was
found to be −0.184e, indicating that the ligand
is more likely to draw the electron density from the Pt center. This
is in agreement with the predicted charge of 1.786e on the Pt ion. Considering the nominal charge of +2.0 on the Pt
ion, these numbers demonstrate a charge transfer of 0.293e from the chloride anion to Pt and then a charge transfer of 0.186e to the ammonia ligand. With a larger extent of the charge
transfer between Pt and Cl, the Pt–Cl bond experiences a bigger
orbital overlap than the Pt–NH3 bond.72,73 This finding also indicates that the Pt–Cl bond exhibits
more covalent characteristics.73Table 3 also demonstrates
that apart from the SMD solvation model, the charge flows away from
the Pt metal ion in the range from 0.252e for the
PBE0/CPCM combination to 0.181e for the PBE0/gas
combination. The M06-2X functional in the gas phase as well as all
DFT functionals with SMD produces slightly elevated charge-transfer
values, further supporting the above established conclusion that both
the DFT functional and inclusion of solvent model are important in
the prediction of accurate vibrations in Pt-based complexes.

In contrast to cisplatin, the charges on the oxygen atoms in carboplatin
are more negative than −1.0e by at least 0.2e regardless of the functional/solvent model combination.
In addition, the atomic charge on O is computed to be more negative
when calculated in the gas phase, which is in agreement with the above
results that solvation plays a role in charge transfer for carboplatin.
This finding highlights that the Pt–O bond is clearly more
ionic than the Pt–Cl bond, with the charge on the Pt ion being
slightly higher than the nominal +2.0 charge. The largest difference
of 0.229e was observed for M06-L with SMD, indicating
the charge transfer from the Pt atom to the ligands.

In addition,
by comparing the charges of ligands in carboplatin
and cisplatin, the direction of charge transfer could potentially
give an insight into the different rates of hydrolysis. Using the
calculations conducted with PBE and gas phase as an example, a charge
transfer of 0.293e from the chloride anion to Pt
and then a charge transfer of 0.184e to the ammonia
ligand in cisplatin. For carboplatin, charge transfer occurs from
Pt to both the O atoms on the cyclobutanedicarboxylate in the amount
of 0.479e, whereas the ammonia ligands experience
charge transfer to a much lesser extent. This redistribution of the
electron density about the ligands for carboplatin could play a pivotal
role in the different rates of hydrolysis and, hence, the different
levels of toxicity of the two Pt drugs.

The overall charges
of NH3 groups in cisplatin and carboplatin
have also been analyzed. As in Table 4, the overall charges of NH3 in cisplatin
are found to be equivalent for all but one calculation, M06-2X and
CPCM solvation model, where one NH3 is 0.066e more negative than the other NH3 ligand. This gives an
indication that the two NH3 ligands result in the same
extent of charge transfer from the Pt metal ion. This is, however,
not the case for carboplatin. The overall charge of the two NH3 ligands in carboplatin is significantly different, for example,
−0.069 and 0.013e with PBE functional and
gas. This difference implies that there is an imbalance of charge
transfer from the metal ion and a larger extent of orbital overlap
for N(3)H3 than N(5)H3. Across the different
combinations of functional and solvation models, the overall charge
of NH3 is more negative in cisplatin than that of carboplatin,
indicating a stronger interaction in the Pt–NH3 bond
in cisplatin.

Merz–Kollman (MK) partial charge analysis
was also performed
to study the atomic charges of cisplatin and carboplatin.67 The results are presented in the Supporting Information and not discussed here
as the findings further support the trends from the ChelpG analysis,
whereby the Pt–O bond in carboplatin is found to exhibit a
stronger ionic character compared to the Pt–Cl bond in cisplatin.
MK analysis is included in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
This study shows that the accuracy of theoretical
vibrational frequencies
in the FIR region of the two Pt complexes depends on the choice of
both DFT functional and solvation model. In the case of cisplatin,
the combination of PBE and SMD was found to be the best for the prediction
of experimentally measured characteristic bands with a MAD and SD
of 5.7 ± 8.5 cm–1, whereas the M06-L and IEFPCM
or CPCM combination is the best choice for carboplatin, with a MAD
and SD of 6.8 ± 9.2 and 6.8 ± 9.1 cm–1, respectively. These findings were attributed to the differences
in the covalent nature of Pt–ligand bonds present in the complex
of interest. As the Pt–Cl bond was found to exhibit more covalent
characteristics than the Pt–O bond in carboplatin, it is not
surprising that PBE performs better for cisplatin because it was designed
to treat covalent bonds.37 This is indicated
by a charge transfer of 0.293e from the chloride
anion to Pt in cisplatin and the reduced charge on Pt below the nominal
+2.0 charge. Instead, the Pt–O bonds were more of ionic nature,
with the Pt charge being slightly higher than the nominal +2.00 charge
and a charge transfer of 0.036 and 0.013e to the
cyclobutanedicarboxylate and NH3 groups. Therefore, M06-L
was found to perform better for carboplatin because it was designed
for ionic systems.36 Projecting these findings
to other Pt-based complexes such as oxaliplatin and nedaplatin with
Pt–O bonds, the M06-L functional with SMD is recommended as
the best choice.

As expected, stretching vibrations are usually
overestimated when
calculated in gas phase as they produce shorter Pt–ligand bonds
when calculated with a solvation model. With the inclusion of the
solvation model, stretching vibrations are usually found to be overestimated
in cisplatin, with the exception of the PBE0 functional in combination
with both IEFPCM and SMD. For carboplatin, the stretching vibrations
are less accurate because of the mixing of stretching and bending
vibrations. While Pt–O stretching vibrations can be found to
be either under- or overestimated, Pt–N vibrations are mostly
overestimated. This further affirms the conclusion that the appropriate
functional–solvation model combination should be determined
to study such complexes with diverse bond characteristics. In addition,
the different scaling factors are required not only for pure bending
and stretching vibrations but also for mixed stretching and bending
vibrations.
