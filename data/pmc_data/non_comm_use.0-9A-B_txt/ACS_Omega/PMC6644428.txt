Systematic americyl-hydration cations
were investigated theoretically
to understand the electronic structures and bonding in [(AmO2)(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6). We obtained the binding energy using density
functional theory methods with scalar relativistic and spin–orbit
coupling effects. The geometric structures of these species have been
investigated in aqueous solution via an implicit solvation model.
Computational results reveal that the complexes of five equatorial
water molecules coordinated to americyl ions are the most stable due
to the enhanced ionic interactions between the AmO22+/1+ cation and multiple oxygen atoms as electron donors.
As expected, Am–Owater bonds in such series are
electrostatic in nature and contain a generally decreasing covalent
character when hydration number increases.

Introduction
In the past several
decades, a rapid increased resurgence of nuclear
power in many countries for the goals of ensuring sustainable energy
supplies has raised a possible hazard to the environment due to the
problems of the radioactive waste and has increased the handling and
reprocessing challenge of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear
waste.1−5 Especially, the long-term radioactivity of nuclear waste repositories
is one of the main issues at stake and is in part determined by the
presence of minor actinides, namely, americium (Am) and curium (Cm),
with the half-life t1/2 = 7370 year for 243Am and t1/2 = 340 000
year for 248Cm.6,7 During the actinide
waste storage, transportation, and separation, water is unavoidable.
Therefore, the characterization and identification of the behavior
of actinide ions in solution is of particular practical importance
in addition to the fundamental actinide chemistry, such as the dynamics
between the coordinated water molecules and the bulk solvent and the
coordination flexibility of actinyl ions.8 So, the solution chemistry of actinide complexes has been considerably
explored in experiment and theory; especially, the hydration of actinide
ions has been widely investigated.9−12 However, such studies have mostly
focused on early actinide ions due to their relatively substantial
quantities and extensive applications. The uranyl UO22+ ion, for example, has received a large amount of interest
because of its importance for environmental chemistry of radioactive
elements and its role as a benchmark system for heavier actinides.13 Experimentally, direct structural information
on the coordination of uranyl in aqueous solution has been mainly
obtained by extended X-ray absorption fine structure or X-ray absorption
near-edge structure measurements.9,14,15 Theoretically, the structural investigation has been
performed via various ab initio studies of uranyl and related molecules,
with a number of explicit water molecules or with a polarizable continuum
model to mimic the environment over the past years, such as [UO2(CO3)3]4–, [Th(H2O)n]4+, [U(H2O)n]3+, UO2Fn(H2O)5–n2–n, and [UO2(H2O)n]n+.10,16−21 With the rapid development of quantum chemical methods, the less
known transuranium elements have been increasingly studied, i.e.,
[NpO2(CO3)3]4–,
[NpO2(CO3)m(H2O)n], [Cm(H3O)n]3+, [UO2(H2O)n]n+, [NpO2(H2O)n]n+, and [PuO2(H2O)n]n+.7,12,13,22−28 There appears to be no theoretical report about americyl (AmO22+/1+) in aqueous solution but one study on the
water exchange mechanism in AmO2(H2O)52+ 15 years ago.29 In addition,
the understanding of the coordination chemistry of americyl ions in
solution can present the essentials to detect, characterize, and differentiate
this metal ion from transition metals or lanthanide metals through
the coordination characteristic. Hence, we will focus on speciation
of the americyl ions (AmO22+ and AmO21+) in this paper, bridging the gap between the wide-established
early actinides and the more complicate later actinides. However,
an accurate description of solvent effects of the actinide complexes
is inherently difficult due to their complicated electronic properties
and the challengeable aqueous environment to theoretical chemists.
There are two typical quantum chemistry strategies used to incorporate
the solvent effects on the geometry and energy of the actinide complexes
in aqueous solution. One is molecular dynamics simulations approach
with a discrete model, where a number of explicit solvent molecules
are included and treated at the same level of theory as that used
for the solute.30 Although this supermolecule
requires a substantial computational expense, the understanding improvement
of the structural and chemical behavior of actinyl in solution is
inconsequential because this method employs empirical potentials affecting
the accuracy significantly, especially for those transplutoniums having
few experimental data available. Another approach is the polarizable
continuum model, where the solvent is described by a dielectric polarizable
continuum.31 This model has shown a good
agreement with experimental results on the geometric and electronic
structures in actinyl–water complexes,15 where uranyl, neptunyl, and plutonyl coordinated to five water ligands
in the equatorial plane have been computationally confirmed.13,32

In this contribution, we report a systematic investigation
on the
chemistry of hydrated americyl ions in the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6) complexes using a suite of computational
modeling and various bonding analysis methods. We address the equilibrium
structures of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+, as well as the hydration number of americyl
ions and the bonding nature of americium ions and oxygen atoms. In
addition to the knowledge for the periodicity in bonding properties,
the influence of aqueous solvation of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6) will provide a scientific comprehension to the actinide
solution chemistry.

Results and Discussion
The static
structures of hydrated complexes of AmO22+/1+ with one to eight water ligands have been regularly investigated
via geometry optimizations in gas phase and in aqueous phase at the
B3LYP/Am/ECP60MWB_SEG//O,H/cc-pVTZ level with or without the conductor-like
screening solvation model (COSMO) method. First, concerning the water
hydrogens lying either in the planes or perpendicular to the planes
defined by the OylAmOyl, two possible gas-phase
symmetric arrangements of water molecules for [AmO2(H2O)1]2+/1+ and [AmO2(H2O)2]2+/1+ have been optimized without
symmetry constraints. As shown in Figure S1, the one with hydrogens perpendicular to the plane has one imaginary
vibrational frequency (428i cm–1) showing the rotation
of water ligand, indicating its instability compared with the one
with hydrogens lying in the plane. Besides, the starting structure
of [AmO2(H2O)7]2+/1+ has
been assumed as a first-shell coordination number of seven when seven
water molecules are bonded to AmO22+/1+, in
which the seven equatorial water ligands lie rigorously in the equatorial
plane. After optimization within density functional theory (DFT),
seven water molecules have been arranged into two coordination shells;
there are five water molecules in the first shell with a relatively
shorter Am–Ow distance of <2.5 Å and two
water molecules in the second shell at a longer distance of >4.4
Å.
Therefore, the hydration number of AmO22+/1+ in the first shell is predicted to be less than seven. In addition,
the optimized structural parameters and calculated binding energies
of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6) in the gas phase and
aqueous solution on the basis of different levels of theory are listed
in Tables S1–S4. As clearly shown
in the Tables S3 and S4, the energy destabilization
by roughly 32.0–128.2 kcal/mol for [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ (n = 1–6) complexes is due to the conductor-like polarized continuum
model; a similar trend is also observed for [AmO2(H2O)n]1+ (n = 1–6) complexes. Upon inclusion of the surrounding effects,
the binding energy decreases drastically to 62.4 kcal/mol for equatorial
[AmO2(H2O)6]2+ and to
−0.5 kcal/mol for equatorial [AmO2(H2O)6]1+ at scalar relativistic (SR)-B3LYP level
of theory, indicating the instability of this structure. In terms
of geometries of equatorial [AmO2(H2O)6]2+/1+, the six-water complexes with all six coordinated
Ow atoms in the equivalent position are subject to the
first-order Jahn–Teller instability and are only saddle points
having imaginary frequencies. The Ci symmetry
structure of [AmO2(H2O)6]2+ in which all six ligands are in the first coordination shell, shown
in Figure S2, is stable with or without
aqueous solution. The distance from the americium center to the water
molecules located above and below the equatorial plane in a symmetric
manner is longer (0.09 Å) than that for [AmO2(H2O)5]2+ and is significantly shorter
(0.13 Å) than that reported for NpO2(H2O)62+ having a similar structure largely owing
to the actinide contraction of ion radii. A somewhat different structure
of [AmO2(H2O)6]1+ is obtained,
whereas the sixth water is excluded to the second hydration shell
owing to the weak electrostatic interaction between AmO21+ and water oxygen. Thus, the hydration number of AmO22+/1+ is five in resulting minimum-energy structures
of both [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6) complexes.

Since the solvation effect is significant on the geometry of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ and also plays a typical role in practical application, we only
report the geometry optimization results under the effect of aqueous
solvation in text. Table 1 presents the binding energies obtained at SR-B3LYP and CCSD(T)
levels of theory for the following reaction of [AmO2]2+/1+ + nH2O → [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6) in solution. As shown in Table 1, each of these [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ (n = 1–6) complexes is significantly more
stable than the corresponding [AmO2(H2O)n]1+ (n = 1–6).
At the SR-B3LYP level of theory, the americyl–water binding
energies steadily increase from 34.0 kcal/mol for [AmO2(H2O)1]2+ (19.1 kcal/mol for [AmO2(H2O)1]1+) to 119.0 kcal/mol
for [AmO2(H2O)5]2+ (68.2
kcal/mol for [AmO2(H2O)5]1+), whereas at the spin–orbit (SO) level of theory, the binding
energies show the same trend by increasing from 45.4 kcal/mol at n = 1 to 135.0 kcal/mol at n = 5 in the
series of AmO2(H2O)n2+. Overall, the substantial stabilizations of [AmO2(H2O)5]2+/1+ relative to
the isolated americyl and free water molecules favors the formation
of a maximum of five water ligands in the equatorial plane in the
first hydration shell. This five-coordination structure has been commonly
observed in other actinyls in water environment in the available experimental
studies and is in good accord with the published theoretical studies
using quantum mechanical method or molecular dynamics approach.

Geometric
Structure of the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–5)
Two different density functionals (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) and B3LYP) were first employed for the geometrical optimization,
which gave similar results, so only the results obtained at B3LYP/Am/ECP60MWB_SEG//O,H/cc-pVTZ
level of theory are presented in the text and those obtained at the
PBE/TZ2P level are detailed in the Supporting Information (Tables S1 and S2). As noted in the last section,
the inclusion of solution therefore and the use of a solvation model
are important in modeling the coordination structures of actinyl.
So the calculated ground-state geometries for [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–5) in aqueous solution using the COSMO solvation
model are listed in Table 2 and shown in Figure 1. In terms of geometry, [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ and [AmO2(H2O)n]1+ have similar
geometric structures; these are the water molecules coordinating to
AmO22+/1+ on the equatorial plane of americyl
with an increasing hydration number from n = 1–5,
as expected, with the same hydration number as that of of uranyl,
neputonyl, and plutonyl in aqueous solution. The calculated Am–Oyl distances in the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ complexes elongate from 1.669 Å
in pure americyl ion to 1.681 Å in [AmO2(H2O)1]2+ and increase all through to 1.711 Å
in [AmO2(H2O)5]2+, whereas
the Am–Oyl bonds in the [AmO2(H2O)n]1+ complexes appear to
follow the same trend, consistent with the decrease in the bond order,
attributed to the weakening of both ionic and covalent bonding interactions
of Am–Oyl bond from n = 1–5.
In all [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–5) complexes, the
americyl is coordinated by water O atoms (Ow) with bond
Am–Ow distances longer than 2.2 Å, which implies
weak bonding interactions. In addition, all Am–Ow bond lengths in the complexes are beyond the range of Am–O
covalent single-bond lengths estimated by the sum of the self-consistent
covalent radii derived by Pyykkö.33 Expectedly, the Am–Ow bond lengths in the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ complexes are shorter than the corresponding bond lengths in the
[AmO2(H2O)n]1+ complexes, owing to the stronger electrostatic interaction
in dication complexes. The lengthening of the Am–Ow bond distances in the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ complexes from 2.260 Å at n = 1 to 2.460 Å at n = 5 implies
the reduction of bond strength and the weakening of bonding interaction
of each Am–Ow bond along with increasing hydration
numbers. Although each of the Am–Ow bonds is not
particularly strong in comparison to Am–Oyl multiple
bond, the overall bonding interaction is substantial, as indicated
by significant binding energies (Table 1) and by the extreme redshift in the americyl asymmetric
stretch frequency (Table 3).

For the monoaqua, the ground electronic states of
[AmO2(H2O)]2+/1+ have been confirmed
as 4B1 and 5A1 via a comparison
among
different multiplicities. Upon the coordination of Ow in
[AmO2(H2O)]2+/1+, the linear OylAmOyl is broken into bent ∠OylAmOyl angles of 179.5 and 179.8°, respectively. The
water molecule coordinates to americyl on the equatorial plane with
the two hydrogen atoms lying symmetrically on both sides of the plane.
The shortest Am–Ow bond distance of 2.26 Å
among the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ series is within the range of single covalent bond
radii of Am–O (2.29 Å), mainly because of the strongest
bonding. These distances are consistent with the bonding analysis
detailed in the next section. The singly filled highest occupied molecular
orbitals of [AmO2(H2O)]2+/1+ have
roughly 98% Am 5fϕ and 90% Am 5fδ character, indicating that the Am 5f orbital is largely unperturbed
by the coordination of the ligands. Thus, [AmO2]2+/1+ retain their electron configuration at Am ions in those [AmO2(H2O)]2+/1+ complexes, namely, fϕ1fδ2 and fϕ2fδ2, respectively.

For the dual aqua, one additional water molecule locates in the
equatorial plane with a bent ∠OwAmOw angle
of 96.8° in [AmO2(H2O)2]2+ and 103.1° in [AmO2(H2O)2]1+, inducing a weakening of both axial and equatorial
bond strength, as reflected by the increase of 0.10 and 0.02 Å
in the Am–Oyl and Am–Ow bond distances
compared to those in [AmO2(H2O)1]2+/1+. The optimized Am–Ow bond distance
is 2.286 Å in [AmO2(H2O)2]2+ and 2.420 Å in [AmO2(H2O)2]1+; the slightly longer distance in the monocation
complex is consistent with the small binding energy. Noticeably, the
favorable bent versus linear geometries of the ∠OwAmOw reveals the covalent characteristic of Am–Ow bond, which pulls the two Ow atoms much closer,
leading to an Ow–Ow distance of 3.420
Å in [AmO2(H2O)2]2+ and 3.790 Å in [AmO2(H2O)2]1+. The electrons singly occupy on Am 5f6d atomic orbital
(AO)-based molecular orbitals (MOs) in [AmO2(H2O)]2+/1+, which provides extensive Am 5f → Ow 2p back-bonding, involving donation from an Am 5fϕ orbital into in-plane Ow 2p orbitals, thus leading to
a three-center interaction. The effectiveness of the Ow 2p → Am 5f6d dative bonding and Am 5f → Ow 2p back donation is less obvious in [AmO2(H2O)2]1+ due to a longer Am–Ow distance, denoted by a relatively large ∠OwAmOw angle of 103.1°. In particular, the variety in the average
effective charges of the Ow ligand, listed in Table 4, is an evidence to
this statement. The average Hirshfeld charges on the Ow of [AmO2(H2O)2]2+ and
[AmO2(H2O)2]+ are −0.16
|e| and −0.20 |e|, respectively,
slightly greater relative to those of −0.15 |e| and −0.20 |e| in [AmO2(H2O)1]2+/1+, as the consequence of the
Am-to-Ow back donation.

For the triaqua, one more water molecule added with
the formation
of [AmO2(H2O)3]2+/1+ further
weakens the Am–O bonds, as identified by the longer Am–Oyl and Am–Ow bond distances than those in
[AmO2(H2O)2]2+/1+. In
gas phase, three coordinated water molecules are equivalent with the
∠OwAmOw angle of 120.0°, giving
a C3v symmetry structure.
However, when concerning the presence of aqua solvent, this symmetry
has been broken into Cs symmetry with
the ∠OwAmOw angles of 127.8, 113.2, and
118.7° in [AmO2(H2O)3]2+ and 117.4, 120.4, and 122.2° in [AmO2(H2O)3]1+ complexes, largely ascribed to the differences
responding to the polarization of the hydration upon solvent inclusion.
In essence, the solvent polarity is more effective in those complexes
with larger polarity. As listed in Table 2, the deviation from the high-symmetry structure
of the ∠OwAmOw angle in [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ is more
obvious than that in [AmO2(H2O)n]1+, suggesting that the structure of
dication ions could result in engaging in stronger hydrogen bonding
with the bulk solvent than that of monocation ions. For example, the
∠OwAmOw angles are 92.7 and 87.3°
in [AmO2(H2O)4]2+ and
66.3, 74.5, and 78.4° in [AmO2(H2O)5]2+, whereas 90.0° in [AmO2(H2O)4]1+ and 72.0° in [AmO2(H2O)5]1+ are retained, thus confirming
that the solvent shows greater differential stabilization in [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ complexes.

From our above discussion of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ structures,
we would expect
the additional water molecules to extend the Am–Oyl and Am–Ow bond lengths and to decrease the overall
degree of dative bonding, consistent with the lower relative binding
energy for the [AmO2(H2O)q]2+/1+ compared to that of the [AmO2(H2O)p]2+/1+ (5 ≥ q = p + 1). The maximum of five hydration
number in the first coordination shell is in good agreement with the
equilibrium structure having five water coordination of actinyl (UO22+, NpO22+, and PuO22+) in aqueous solution. In the equilibrium structure
of [AmO2(H2O)5]2+/1+,
four water molecules bonded to the center americyl are perpendicular
to the equatorial plane and the fifth coordinated water molecule arranges
within the equatorial plane where the dihedral angle between the equatorial
water ligands and the equatorial plane is 0° (Figure 1). The bond length of the fifth
Am–Ow bond is 2.420 Å in [AmO2(H2O)5]2+ and 2.548 Å in [AmO2(H2O)5]1+, the shortest one
among five Am–Ow bond distances, thus leading to
a slight bent of ∠OylAmOyl angles of
179.4°.

Electronic Structure and Chemical Bonding
of the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–5)
To provide
further insights into
the interactions between americyl ion and the water ligands of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+, several bonding analyses were performed, including the bond order
analyses, population partitioning schemes, energy decomposition approach,
Kohn–Sham orbital interaction, and electron localization function
(ELF) method.

The bond order analyses by three methods give
a similar trend that is consistent with the previous detailed bond
length trend. Taking the Mayer Am–O bond index as an example,
the calculated Mayer bond orders (Table 5) of Am–Oyl and Am–Ow for the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ complexes lie in two ranges, at averaged 1.9
and averaged 0.2, respectively, whereas those for [AmO2(H2O)n]1+ complexes
lie in two ranges, at averaged 1.85 and averaged 0.2, respectively.
This result indicates relatively weak Am–Ow bonding
interactions compared with the Am–Oyl bonding in
[AmO2(H2O)n]1+ complexes, which is resulted from not only the ionic bonding
nature but also the somewhat longer bond distance induced by weaker
orbital interaction. The calculated Am–Oyl bond
order in [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ decreases gradually from 2.05 at n = 1 to 1.88 at n = 5, whereas the Am–Ow bond order decreases from 0.39 at n = 1
further to 0.19 at n = 5, suggesting there is a general
decrease in Am–O bond strength with an increasing hydration
number. In addition to the bond order, the effective atomic charges
on Am and Ow ions can imply the variation of the ionicity
of the Am–Ow bond. Several charge analyses were
carried out on the B3LYP stationary structure in solution via COSMO.
Although the absolute values are different on the basis of different
methods used, the trend is the same. As listed in Table 4, the averaged Hirshfeld charges
reveal that Am carries a considerable positive charge and the Ow ligands carry substantial negative charges in these [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ complexes, which is in good agreement with the bond order analyses,
indicating an ionic An–Ow bonding interaction. Generally,
the Am ions become less charged and both Oyl and Ow atoms become more charged along with the increase of the
hydration number, i.e., the calculated Hirshfeld charge of Am decreases
from +2.06 |e| in pure AmO22+ to +1.77 |e| in monoaqua and further to +1.11 |e| in penta-aqua, accompanied by an increased charge of
each Oyl atom from −0.03 |e| to
−0.21 |e|; this is due to the charge rearrangement
of americyl unit upon inclusion of explicit water in the first shell
and implicit water by COSMO, which is in good agreement with the study
of [UO2(H2O)m(OH)n]2–n.34 The averaged Hirshfeld charges of Ow atoms becoming greater from −0.15 |e| to
−0.21 |e| suggests overall increasing of electron
back donation into Ow ligand, thus leading to the Am–Oyl bond weakening with an increasing hydration number. In addition,
the decreased electron density localized on americyl unit listed in Table 4 indicates that the
charge transfer is from americyl unit to water ligands, owing to the
Am-to-Ow back donation. Furthermore, the formal Am oxidation
state of +VI and +V is not apparently affected by the hydration number
in these [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ complexes via population analyses.

To better understand the orbital
interactions, Figure 2 shows the Kohn–Sham
MO energy levels of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ at SR-PBE/TZ2P level. In the linear AmO22+ moiety due to Am–Oyl bonding,
the Am 5f and 6d orbitals transform as 5fu and 6dg species, respectively. Upon dative coordination with the water oxygen
atoms in the equatorial plane, the Am–Ow orbital
interactions cause to 6dg level further destabilization.
While both dδg and fδu–fϕu orbitals lie around the equatorial plane, the Am–Ow orbital interactions mainly affect the 6d orbitals, indicating
that the coordinated water molecules only slightly interact with the
“nonbonding” contracted 5f orbitals. This bonding module
is in good agreement with the well-known bonding principle proposed
for actinides by Bursten, the FEUDAL (“f’s are essentially
unaffected, d’s accommodate ligands”).35,36 Overall, the Am–Ow bonding in [AmO2(H2O)1]2+ is strongest among these
[AmO2(H2O)n]2+ complexes and becomes progressively weaker on increasing
the hydration number, consistent with the indirect evidence from geometries,
vibrational frequencies, and bond order. These conclusions are consistent
with the bonding compositions of the natural localized MOs (NLMOs, Table S5), with analysis detailed below.

molecular orbital analyses of the AmO2(H2O)n2+ complexes
based on SR-zero-order regular approximation (ZORA) B3LYP/TZ2P calculations.

In addition to these chemical
bonding analyses based on wave functions
and electron densities, the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based
on canonical molecular orbitals and the extended transition state
(ETS) method combined with the natural orbitals for chemical valence
(ETS–NOCV) theory were further applied to reveal the intrinsic
bonding mechanism in terms of the major contributions to the orbital
interactions. The computed EDA results for AmO22+/1+ + nH2O → [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (Tables 6 and 7) show that electrostatic ionic interaction (ΔEelstat) accounts for almost 2/3 contribution
to the total bonding energy (ΔEint), playing more significant roles than those of orbital interaction
(ΔEorbital). The decreasing trend
of both electrostatic interactions and covalent orbital interactions
are the same as those of bonding energies, that is, generally increasing
with the hydration number from monoaqua toward penta-aqua. The change
of ΔEelstat or ΔEorbital is not significantly in tetra-aqua and penta-aqua,
reflecting that the variation of both ionic and covalent interactions
with the increasing number of the water molecules becomes smaller
in aqueous solution. In contrast to the monotonous increase of ΔEelstat or ΔEorbital, the Pauli repulsion increases remarkably from 65.3 kcal/mol in
monoaqua to 159.6 kcal/mol in tetra-aqua, then declines to 151.4 kcal/mol
in penta-aqua, indicating the formation of the stable penta-aqua.
The ETS–NOCV analyses additionally reveal the intrinsic bonding
mechanism in terms of the contributions to the orbital interactions.
The results of some representative contributions for [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ are
listed in Tables 6 and 7, and their deformation densities describing the
density inflow are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The highest
covalent character of each Am–Ow bond can be observed
in monoaqua among these [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ complexes in terms of the orbital
interaction, which is decomposed into two types (π-type and
σ-type) with several terms, taking orb1–orb3 as examples,
providing energetic stabilizations of ΔEorb1 = −29.2 kcal/mol, ΔEorb2 = −14.4 kcal/mol, and ΔEorb3 = −6.4 kcal/mol, respectively. These natural
orbitals denote the typical π- or σ-type orbital interactions
achieved via two fragments of americyl and water molecules, relating
to the Am 5f6d-hybridized atomic orbitals and π-MOs of water
molecules contributed by Ow 2p atomic orbitals. Note that
consistent with the reduced trend of bonding energy of each Am–Ow bond across the series, the trend of the donation character
is also decreased accompanied by a decrease of major orbital contributions
and a slight lengthening of Am–Ow bonds. The composition
of the stabilization energy of each Am–Ow bond in
[AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ complexes is small, but the summarization is substantial
and increases across the series. Therefore, the orbital interactions
between the An 5f6d hybrid orbitals and π-MOs of Ow result in a significant covalent bonding character not only stabilizing
[AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ complexes beyond electrostatic ionic interaction but
also effectively supporting the weak bonding characteristics of 5f
orbital, which is consistent with the ELF result shown in Figure 5 and with the NLMO
analyses (listed in Table S5).

Considering that the Am–Ow dative bond and back
donation were observed from density deformation analyses, NLMO calculations
were further explored to describe the extent of this bonding interaction.
The localized σ- and π- MOs on Am–Ow are made up of Am 5f6d and O 2s2p hybrid orbitals, which are composed
by roughly 95% O 2s2p lone-pair AO and ∼5% Am df hybrid orbitals
in [AmO2(H2O)n]2+ and by ∼98% O 2s2p lone-pair AO and ∼2% Am
df hybrid orbitals in [AmO2(H2O)n]1+ on the basis of the NLMO analyses.
The enhanced stability of [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ complexes across the series can
only be explained as a result of the water coordinates inducing the
increased electrostatic energy. Noticeably, the Am 6d participating
in the dative oxygen bonding plays an important role over Am 5f due
to both more extended radial distribution of the Am 6d orbitals and
the better energy level matching between the An 6d and O 2p orbitals.
The compositions of the NLMOs from Am valence atomic orbitals decline
from around 3% of the σ orbitals and 7% of the π orbitals
in [AmO2(H2O)1]2+ to 1%
and 6% in [AmO2(H2O)5]2+.

Conclusions
Through relativistic quantum chemical calculations,
the electronic
and geometric structures of the [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+ (n = 1–6)
complexes have been systematically studied. Full five-coordination
binding of water ligands in the first shell is preferred in the aqua
solution for [AmO2(H2O)n]2+/1+. Extensive chemical bonding analyses of the
charges, energy decomposition analysis, and natural orbitals, all
agree in that the Am–Ow interaction is predominantly
ionic in nature, with a small extent of covalent bonding contribution
resulted from the An 5f6d-hybridized orbitals and relevant Ow 2p orbitals. The covalent orbital interaction between the equatorial
Ow and Am ions raises several interesting features in the
bonding of Am–Ow: (1) a bonding interaction between
the Am AOs and the Ow 2p orbitals arranges the water ligand
deviation from linear in [AmO2(H2O)2]2+/1+ into bent; (2) the reduced dative bonding affects
the Am–Ow bond length and bond order across the
series; (3) the small back-bonding donations of Am 5f → Ow 2p decrease the population of americium ions. As noted, the
implicit solvation model is unable to provide the dynamics information
of actinide ions in solution or the exchange of ion-influenced solvent
molecules with the bulk, which is important to some extent in practical
application. Further quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular
dynamics simulation with explicit solvent is necessary to study statistically
the equilibrium between americyl and water in different coordination
shells. We hope that this investigation represents only the beginning
of long-term research relevant to the mission in spent fuel reprocessing
of the transplutonium, in addition to enriching our knowledge of actinide
coordination chemistry.

Methodology
The calculations on
the open-shell americyl complexes were carried
out with unrestricted Kohn–Sham wave functions. As known, the
molecular orbital (MO) diagram of pure americyl is similar to that
of uranyl: the combinations of the 2p orbitals of the two oxygen with
the 6d orbitals of the americium atom form occupied bonding orbitals,
whereas the combinations of the O 2p orbitals with the 5f manifold
orbitals of the actinide atom result in nonbonding δu and ϕu orbitals and antibonding σu* and πu* orbitals; the corresponding bonding σu and πu orbitals are found to have rather
small 5f contributions. In AmO22+ and AmO21+, the americium has the configurations 5f3 and 5f4, respectively, and these electrons are
spread in the nonbonding 5fδu and 5fϕu orbitals. Following Hund’s rule, the ground electronic states
of hexavalent and pentavalent Am ions have been found to be of a high-spin
character, that is, fδ2fϕ1 and fδ2fϕ2 configurations and 4Δ and 5Σ electronic states for AmO22+ and AmO21+, respectively. The spin–orbit coupling
(SOC) effects should be considered during the calculations of the
electronic structures of americyl complexes in solution.37

The scalar relativistic DFT calculations
were performed with the
Gaussian 09 and ADF 2017 softwares38−40 for the geometry optimizations
and vibrational frequency analyses. First, for geometry optimizations
by the Gaussian code, we used the scalar relativistic Stuttgart energy-consistent
relativistic 32 valence electron pseudopotential and the associated
ECP60MWB_SEG valence basis set41,42 for the americium atom.
The split-valence triple-ζ basis sets with polarization functions
(cc-pVTZ)43,44 were used for the oxygen and hydrogen atoms.
The B3LYP hybrid density functional45,46 was used in
these calculations. The solvent effects were approximated using the
Gaussian 09 implementation of the conductor-like screening solvation
model (COSMO) solvent model,47,48 where the solute is
embedded in a shape-adapted cavity consisting of interlocking spheres
centered on each solute atom or group. The combination of these pseudopotentials
and basis sets with this functional (labeled as B3LYP/Am/ECP60MWB_SEG//O,
H/cc-pVTZ level) has been shown to give accurate predictions of the
properties and reaction energies of actinide complexes.19,20 At the same B3LYP theory level, vibrational frequency calculations
were further performed to ensure that all force constants should be
positive and all frequencies should be real. Ultrafine integration
grids and very tight optimization were applied. The spin–orbital
symmetry restrictions were relaxed, performing spin-unrestricted UDFT
calculations.

The coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and
perturbative triples
(CCSD(T)) method49−51 in MOLPRO 2012 program52 was used for single-point calculations on the optimized aqueous-phase
B3LYP geometries to check whether the systems have multireference
character and to acquire more accurate relative energies. The ECP60MWB
pseudopotential with ECP60MWB_SEG basis set for Am and the cc-pVTZ
basis for O and H were applied in the CCSD(T) calculations. However,
limited by the computer resources, the nonsymmetry molecules of [AmO2(H2O)5]2+/1+ or [AmO2(H2O)6]2+/1+ cannot be handled
by CCSD(T) due to the giant basis of those molecules.

Further
electronic structure and chemical bonding analyses at the
DF level were performed with the ADF 2017. The scalar relativistic
(SR) effects were taken into account by the zero-order regular approximation
(ZORA).53,54 The SOC effects were taken into account
by SO-ZORA. The frozen-core approximation was applied to the atomic
[1s2–5d10] shell of Am and the [1s2] shells of the O atoms. The B3LYP combined with slater basis
sets of triple-ζ plus two polarization function (TZ2P) quality
were applied.55 Single-point calculations
were carried out on the B3LYP/Am/ECP60MWB_SEG//O H/cc-pVTZ optimized
aqueous-phase structures to determine the charge distribution and
bond order. The bond order analyses based on the Mayer method,56 Gopinathan–Jug indices,57 and Nalewajski–Mrozek method58,59 were performed. The charge analyses based on the Mulliken method,60 Hirshfeld analysis,61 Voronoi deformation density (VDD),62 and
multipole derived charges (MDC)63 were
calculated as well. The energy decomposition analyses (EDA) based
on canonical molecular orbitals and theoretical analyses via combined
extended transition state (ETS) with the natural orbitals for chemical
valence (NOCV) theory59,64−66 were carried
out. The electron localization functions (ELF) were calculated to
investigate the feature of the weak dative bonding. Weinhold’s
natural bond orbital (NBO)67 and natural
localized molecular orbital (NLMO)67−70 analyses were performed at the
B3LYP/6-31G* level71 on optimized geometries
from B3LYP calculations by using the NBO 5.0 program.72,73

In further geometry optimizations, the generalized gradient
approximation
with the PBE exchange–correlation functional74 was used in ADF 2017. Scalar (SR) and SO relativistic effects
were accounted by applying the same stratagem as detailed in the above
paragraph. The effects of water considered by COSMO were determined
using single-point energy calculation on gas-phase structures. The
atomic COSMO-default radii 210.0 pm was used.48
