As
an improvement over organic or inorganic layered crystals, the
synthetic monolayer ZnO(M) inherits semiconductivity and hostability
from its bulk, yet it acts as a promising host for dilute magnetic
semiconductors. Here, we report the electronic and magnetic properties
of ZnO(M) doped with one 3d transition metal ion and simultaneously
adsorbed with another 3d transition metal ion. Two sequences are studied,
one where the dopant is fixed to Mn and the adsorbate is varied from
Sc to Zn and another where the dopant and adsorbate are reversed.
First-principles results show that the stable adsorbed−doped
systems possess a lower bandgap energy than that of the host. System
magnetic moments can be tuned to |5 – x|μB, where x refers to the magnetic moment of
the individual 3d atom. An interplay between superexchange and direct
exchange yields a ferromagnetic system dually adsorbed−doped
with Mn. In addition to a novel material design route, the magnetic
interaction mechanism is found beyond two dimensions, having been
identified for its three-dimensional bulk and zero-dimensional cluster
counterparts.

1 Introduction
Pioneering
research on the unique properties of monolayer MoS21−3 have extended studies of two-dimensional (2D) materials
from organic graphene to inorganic layered crystals (ILCs).4 Benefiting from the covalent bonds in the layers
and van der Waals forces among layers, these atomic crystals are easily
manipulated for use in different applications. As an improvement over
semimetallic graphene,5,6 most ILCs have a nonzero bandgap,
yet they lack, for example, magnetic properties that would enable
their wide applications in magnetic drivers or spintronics. Theoretical
predictions show that magnetic properties can be realized through
the introduction of noble metal nanoparticles, halogen elements, and
transition metals (TMs) into the ILC systems. Consequently, dilute
magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) can be formed in proper ILC hosts,
for example, low-dimensional TM dichalcogenides. However, experimental
realization of these routes remains challenging for naturally occurring
ILCs. Foreign atoms present in the vapor deposition method undergo
fast nucleation on surfaces,7 resulting
in weak bonding of the dopants after they land softly on the ILC surface.8,9 Substitutional atoms within ILC systems bring into question the
ability of the ILC’s unique structure to survive. Covalent
bonds in layers will be distorted because of differences in electronegativity
between doping elements and the ILC hosts.10

As the most conventional DMS host, ZnO also has a stable monolayer
form, ZnO(M). Honeycomb-shaped ZnO(M) is formed from its wurtzite
counterpart when its thickness is decreased to a few atoms.11 Inherited from its bulk, the hostability for
magnetic dopants stays with the monolayer counterpart.12 Similar to most ILCs, the layered ZnO structure
also has the potential to be piled up to three-dimensional (3D) forms
or to produce 3D heterolayer stacking,13 with each layer consisting of enough functional units, such as doped
atoms.4 Analogous to doped bulk ZnO,14,15 3d TM-doped ZnO(M)—the TM–ZnO(M) complexes—also
show intrinsic magnetism.12 It is worth
noting that the surface of the ILCs can be used as an adsorbent for
individual atoms or clusters. Intrinsic ferromagnetism has been introduced
to decorated systems of TM@MoS216 and systems of TM@ZnO(M).17 It has further
been noticed that doping an isoelectric cluster into an ILC will extrude
atoms in the host while still keeping the layered form of the host.18 Such an arrangement between the ILC host and
a cluster looks very much the same as combinations of in-plane substitution12 and out-of-plane adsorption.17 Thus, a strategy that combines doping and adsorption in
a ZnO(M) system may yield very special magnetic properties from the
ILCs and correlation schemes beyond DMS manipulations.

Here,
we report a first-principles investigation of the electronic
and magnetic properties of monolayer ZnO simultaneously doped and
adsorbed with 3d TM dopants. As shown in Figure 1, the first TM impurity (TM1) acts as the
adsorbate, whereas the second (TM2) acts as the dopant in a 5 ×
5 ZnO(M) supercell. This system is named TM1@TM2–ZnO. Because
of the large number of possible combinations of 3d TM1 and TM2 varieties,
we constructed systems by first fixing TM1 to Mn (Z = 26) and varying TM2 from Sc to Zn (Z = 21–30),
considering the robust ferromagnetism of Mn doped12 and decorated ZnO systems.17 The doping route was further extended via alternating the positions
of the dopants and adsorbates, for example, doping Mn in the monolayer
plane and adsorbing Sc to Cu on the plane. In total, 20 adsorbed−doped
systems were studied.

TM2 atoms, respectively.

2 Results and Discussion
After a full optimization
of all possible adsorbing positions including
magnetic order effects, it is found that the most stable adsorption
site in both the Mn@TM2–ZnO and TM1@Mn–ZnO systems is
above the O atom linked to the doped TM2 atom, except for Zn@Mn–ZnO,
as Figure 1 shows.
Other possible adsorption sites at the bridge, hollow face, and top
Zn atom as well as above other O atoms apart from the TM2 atom are
energetically unfavorable. Figure S1 shows
zoomed-in images of the adsorbed positions and structures along with
bond lengths d (in angstroms). Monolayer ZnO(M) is
badly distorted in Mn@Ni–ZnO and Mn@Cu–ZnO with a back
row of doping TM2 elements and in Sc@Mn–ZnO, Ti@Mn–ZnO,
and V@Mn–ZnO with a front row of adsorbing TM1 elements.

The thermodynamic stability of TM1@TM2–ZnO was analyzed
by calculating the adsorption energies Ead, defined as 1  where Etotal(TM1@TM2–ZnO)
and Etotal(TM2–ZnO) represent total
energies of the lowest energy structures of TM1@TM2–ZnO and
TM2–ZnO, respectively, and E(TM1) is the energy
of the individual TM1 atom. All adsorption energies are found to be
largely above zero, as shown in Table 1, indicating an energetically favorable process for
the adsorption of TM1 atoms in the doped ZnO layer. Mn@Cr–ZnO
and Cr@Mn–ZnO have the largest Ead in their respective groups, which suggests that Cr and Mn atoms
could stabilize monolayer ZnO by doping and adsorption. Obviously,
there is a strong interaction between the adsorbed TM1 atoms and the
host O atom. The TM1–O bond has ionic character. For example,
charge transfer from Mn to O in Mn@Cr–ZnO and that from Cr
to O in Cr@Mn–ZnO is 0.153e and 0.249e, respectively, according to Mulliken population analysis.

structures that cannot be maintained.

The dynamic stabilities of the TM1@TM2–ZnO
systems at room
temperature (T = 300 K) were also examined using
molecular dynamics simulations implemented in the DMOL3 code. The Nosé–Hoover thermostat was used for NVT
dynamics. The simulated results for Mn@Cr–ZnO and Cr@Mn–ZnO
are shown in Figure S2. The integrity of
the structures is still maintained after the systems are heated for
10 ps. No domino effect appears, and the total potential energies
remain almost invariant. Thus, the adsorbed−doped systems are
stable at room temperature.

Electronic structures of the TM1@TM2–ZnO
systems are compared
with those of the pristine ZnO monolayer. From our calculations, ZnO(M)
is a direct bandgap semiconductor with an energy of Egap = 1.90 eV at the Γ point. This value is slightly
larger than that obtained in previous density functional theory (DFT)
studies, approximately 1.70 eV,19−21 which is most probably due to
the use of the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set
in the present study. Compared with that of the host, bandgap values
are all reduced in the TM1@TM2–ZnO systems. Such a reduction
can significantly affect the optical and transport properties of the
material. It can be seen from Table 1 that Mn@Mn–ZnO has the largest bandgap among
TM1@TM2–ZnO at 0.81 eV. It should be noted that Mn@Sc–ZnO
and Fe@Mn–ZnO have the smallest bandgap, 0.05 eV, which is
very close to that of semimetals. The bandgap of Mn@TM2–ZnO
gradually decreases from Mn substitution on both sides toward Sc and
Cu. On the other hand, the bandgap of TM1@Mn–ZnO exhibits odd–even
alternations with the exception of Zn@Mn–ZnO. The host Zn atom
has completely filled d and s shells. However, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, and Ni all have open d shells. By taking into consideration
the structural difference shown in Figure S1, we can conclude that a partially filled d shell of TM atoms plays
a crucial role in determining the structures and properties of the
TM1@TM2–ZnO systems. Figure S3 shows
that doping and adsorption by TM atoms introduce electrons into both
the conduction and valence bands of the ZnO monolayer sheet, which
should significantly enhance the electric conductivity and chemical
activity of the ZnO(M) sheet. The conduction band minimum (CBM) above
the Fermi level of TM1@TM2–ZnO mainly consisted of bands arising
from pure ZnO. The TM atoms significantly reduce the CBM from that
of ZnO. On the other hand, bands next to the valence band maximum
of TM1@TM2–ZnO are mainly composed of bands from the TM atoms.

The magnetic properties in the present adsorbed−doped systems
are very different from those of solely doped or decorated monolayers.
In the TM–ZnO or TM@ZnO layers, the magnetic moments of impure
TM atoms are not quenched by the nonmagnetic host, ZnO(M). For example,
the adsorbed TM atoms are able to maintain their atomic spin magnetic
moments in TM@ZnO systems, as shown in Table S1. This result agrees well with the results of other available DFT
studies.17,22,23 The total
magnetic moments of the TM1@TM2–ZnO complex and the local magnetic
moments of the adsorbed TM1 atom and doped TM2 atom are tabulated
in Table 2. Both Mn@TM2–ZnO
and TM1@Mn–ZnO generate tunable magnetic moments, varying from
0 to 5μB per cell with the different TM atoms. In
both cases, the TM atoms counter the magnetic character of the Mn
atoms. The Mn atoms are the major contributors to the total magnetic
moment, whereas the TM atoms hold only a minor magnetic moment. A
single Mn atom has five unpaired electrons with 5μB magnetic moments, so the total magnetic moment of the TM1@TM2–ZnO
complex can be viewed as |5 – x|μB, where x is the magnetic moment of another
TM atom. Within this trend, the ground spin state of Mn@Mn–ZnO
has zero magnetic moment, as shown in Table 2. Other spin states are less stable than
the one with zero magnetic moment (see Figure S4). The above result indicates that monolayer ZnO can be easily
switched between magnetic and nonmagnetic via adsorbing or dissociating
a Mn atom.

monolayer structure that cannot be maintained.

Because all stable complexes contain
two TM atoms bending toward
each other, we also compare the magnetism of the doped−adsorbed
systems with that of individual TM–Mn dimers. The magnetic
properties in the present 2D systems are completely different from
those of TM–Mn 0D clusters. As shown in Table S2, the magnetic moments of TM–Mn clusters demonstrate
a regular pattern of (5 + y)μB,
where y represents the magnetic moment of the individual
TM atom from Cr to Zn. However, this formulation does not apply to
TM–Mn, where the 3d orbital of TM is less than half-filled.
The s electrons from these TMs also contribute to the magnetism of
the dimer. The first three dimers (TM = Sc, Ti, and V) possess magnetic
moments of (5 – x – 2)μB, where −2μB arises from excitations of two
s electrons to d orbitals, partially canceling the electron spin majority.
Such an electron configuration also explains structural deteriorations
in the corresponding TM@Mn–ZnO (TM = Sc, Ti, and V) monolayers:
both 4s electrons of the adsorbed TM atom preferably occupy d states
in the nearby “dimer” because of magnetic interactions,
leaving the s shell empty. Consequently, electrons from neighboring
atoms tend to occupy the vacancies, drag the atoms out of plane, and
distort the 2D structure of the host (see Figure S5).

Extensive comparisons are performed for electronic
structures and
magnetisms between the present doped−adsorbed systems and the
TM-doped nitride semiconductors. In general, the bandgaps of both
ZnO(M) and the nitrides were reduced after introducing the TM dopants
into the semiconductive hosts.24,25 However, differing
from the half-metallic or even Dirac half-metallic properties26 resulting from the doped nitrides, the present
systems still keep their semiconductive nature with nonzero bandgaps.
Additional bands that arise from the dopants do not cross the Fermi
level in the systems investigated here. The magnetic properties of
the ZnO(M) systems are also different from the nitrides after being
modulated by two external dopants. Although the magnetism can be switched
gradually here, ferromagnetism dominates the aforementioned doped
nitride compounds. In an extreme case with a cluster of reduced space,
for example, Cr2-doped (GaN)x, the magnetism from the dimer, although it can be affected partially
by the host, still contributes to the final ferromagnetism of the
doped systems.27,28

Despite successes in the
design of DMSs, the magnetic properties
of the present systems, especially antiferromagnetic Mn@Mn–ZnO,
raise interesting questions about their origins. To qualitatively
rationalize the magnetic properties, the orbitals of the highest occupied
valence band (HOVB) of Mn@Mn–ZnO are visualized in Figure 2. In Figure 2, HOVB-1 indicates that the
2p orbital of the O atom overlaps with the 3d orbital of the Mn atom
on top (adsorbed), whereas HOVB-2 presents the effective orbital overlap
between the 2p orbital of the O atom and the 3d orbital of the Mn
atom (doped). The Mn–O–Mn bond angle is approximately
90°, close to the value of 90° for a face-centered cubic
MnO crystal. Spin coupling between Mn cations is mainly performed
through the bonded oxygen atom in between. Thus, superexchange coupling
between Mn cations in close proximity occurs through the O anion,
resulting in an antiferromagnetic interaction of the spins in these
two neighboring Mn atoms. This phenomenon is different from the ferromagnetic
coupling in a Co-doped ZnO(M) sheet, which is mainly guided by a direct
exchange interaction without any additional defect as reported by
Schmidt et al.29 However, such a local
superexchange interaction is also different from the bulk phase of
MnO, where the electron coupling in the entire crystal happens completely
through oxygen.30,31 In Figure 2b, significant interactions can also be found
among the neighboring Mn, O, and Mn atoms. Direct electron density
overlap between two Mn atoms is identified, similar to the direct
exchange between Mn atoms in a Mn dimer,16 but it produces broken symmetry. Thus, the antiferromagnetism resulted
from the interplay between the local Mn–O–Mn superexchange
effect and direct magnetic exchange between two Mn impurities. To
examine this, we take the electronic partial density of states (PDOS)
plots of Mn–O–Mn atoms in Figure 3 to show hybridization in the studied monolayer.
The superposition of one sharp peak originates from the d orbital
of adsorbed Mn and the p orbital of O at −1.5 eV near the Fermi
level. On the other hand, there is another obvious peak superposition
between the d orbital of doped Mn and the p orbital of O in the −6
eV region. Again, the PDOS in the present systems serves different
roles toward the magnetic properties compared with that for the doped
nitrides, where the majority of the density of states accounts for
their metallicity and the minority accounts for their semiconductivity.32

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we presented a successful strategy to tailor the
electronic and magnetic properties of a ZnO monolayer via doping and
sequentially adsorbing TM atoms. Considering the technical readiness
of ZnO manipulation,15 experimental applications
of the designed systems are highly feasible. In addition to yielding
unique intrinsic DMSs, the first-principles results also give new
insights into magnetic coupling within adsorbed−doped systems.
An interplay between local superexchange and direct magnetic exchange
is found in the Mn@Mn–ZnO system. It is hoped that the present
work will inspire fundamental research on magnetic coupling mechanisms
in low dimensions in addition to facilitating advances in material
functionality.

4 Computational Methods
All calculations were performed using the DMOL3 package.33 A relativistic semicore pseudopotential replacing
core electrons by a single effective potential was used for the spin-unrestricted
calculations. The DNP functions were employed as basis. Generalized
gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional form was chosen.34 During geometry
optimization, the quality of the self-consistent field convergence
tolerance was set as “fine”. A convergence criterion
of 1 × 10–6 hartree was applied on the total
energy and electron density, 2 × 10–3 hartree/Å
on the gradient, and 5 × 10–3 Å on lattice
displacements. The 5 × 5 supercells were constructed from 51
atoms comprising 24 Zn atoms, 25 O atoms, 1 adsorbing TM1 atom, and
1 doping TM2 atom for the monolayer TM1@TM2–ZnO system. A vacuum
region of 20 Å was selected in the z-direction
to exclude mirror interactions between neighboring images. To elucidate
the magnetic properties of the system, we carried out a detailed calculation
for each possible spin multiplicity ranging from 1 to 12 to determine
the ground spin state.

The strategy was carried out via optimizing the ZnO(M) host, which
was followed by doping and finalized by adsorbing adsorbates on the
doped monolayer. A 5 × 5 supercell of ZnO(M) matrix was first
investigated, and the results are cross-checked with those reported
in the literature. The supercell was relaxed before doping and adsorbing
the TM atoms. The lattice constant of pristine monolayer ZnO is 3.298
Å, with a Zn–O bond length of ∼1.91 Å, agreeing
well with the experimental value of 1.92 Å11 and other DFT calculations of 1.90 Å.19−21 Then, the TM2 doped into ZnO(M) with Zn site substitution (TM2–ZnO)
was optimized. Finally, another TM1 atom adsorbed on the surface of
the TM2–ZnO was constructed and named TM1@TM2–ZnO.
