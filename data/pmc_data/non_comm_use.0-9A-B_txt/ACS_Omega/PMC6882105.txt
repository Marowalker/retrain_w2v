Three regioregular thiophenic copolymers, characterized
by a bromine atom or a C60-fullerene group at different
molar ratios at the end of a decamethylenic plastifying side chain,
have been successfully synthesized using a straightforward postpolymerization
functionalization procedure based on a Grignard coupling reaction.
Owing to their good solubility in common organic solvents, the products
were fully characterized using chromatographic, spectroscopic, thermal,
and morphological techniques and used as single materials in the photoactive
layers of organic solar cells. The photoconversion efficiencies obtained
with copolymers were compared with those of a reference cell prepared
using a physical blend of the precursor homopolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. The best results were obtained
with COP2, the copolymer with a 21% molar content of C60-functionalized side chains. The use of the double-cable polymer
made possible an enhanced control on the nanomorphology of the active
blend, thus reducing phase-segregation phenomena as well as the macroscale
separation between the electron-acceptor and -donor components, yielding
a power conversion efficiency higher than that of the reference cell
(4.05 vs 3.68%). Moreover, the presence of the halogen group was exploited
for the photo-cross-linking of the active layer immediately after
the thermal annealing procedure. The cross-linked samples showed an
increased stability over time, leading to good efficiencies even after
120 h of accelerated aging: this was a key feature for the widespread
practical applicability of the prepared devices.

Introduction
Organic solar cells
(OSCs) have attracted significant attention as a valuable source of
renewable energy owing to their light weight, flexibility, and low
production cost.1 The processability and
structural versatility of the semiconducting conjugated polymers used
for photoactive layers2 offer the possibility
to prepare large-area solar cells on different substrates using simple
and low-environmental-impact technologies.3 OSCs based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron-donor
(ED) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)
as an electron-acceptor (EA) component have been widely studied and
optimized, mainly acting on the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM photoactive
blend.4 Significant improvements were obtained
with the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architecture, a microphase-separated
blend of an ED-conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative as an
EA molecule, in which the generation of free charge carriers and their
subsequent fast transport to the electrodes was highly promoted.5,6 It is usually difficult, however, to obtain an optimized three-dimensional
nanomorphology of the photoactive blend in a BHJ solar cell, since
the final result depends on many factors, such as the polymer:PCBM
ratio, the nature of the deposition solvent, regioregularity, molecular
weight and polydispersity of the ED polymer, and annealing conditions
of the deposited blend. At a molecular level, an ideal BHJ should
be made up of an interpenetrated network of donor and acceptor materials,
giving domains of dimensions comparable with the exciton diffusion
length (5–20 nm on average)7 without
reducing the degree of crystallinity of the polymer, because the charge
carrier mobility is strongly related to the structural order of the
ED component.8 Moreover, the optimum morphology
of the blend, usually obtained by means of an annealing procedure,
is not stable over time due to phase separation. Indeed, ED–EA
nanosegregated phases are not thermodynamically stable and tend to
evolve with time, forming EA clusters as a consequence of the relatively
low Tg of polymers and the immiscibility
of the two components. This disadvantage can be prevented either using
high Tg conjugated polymers or by inserting
photo-cross-linkable groups in the polymer side chains, as they can
stabilize the blend morphology after the annealing process. In the
latter case, photosensitive groups should be placed at a proper distance
from the polymer main chain (usually 6–10 methylene groups)
to avoid any effect on the electronic properties of the conjugated
backbone.9,10 The presence of flexible alkyl side chains
can also have positive effects on the solubility and morphology of
“double-cable” polymers, in which the EA group is located
in pendant side chains linked to the ED-conjugated backbone.11−14 In
these systems, the presence of longer alkyl spacers in side chains
can induce a better nanophase separation between the polymer backbone
and EA units, also improving the crystallinity of the polymer by generating
an enhanced π–π stacking of macromolecular chains.15 Once again, these results evidence the importance
of the morphology of the ED–EA blend, which is strongly related
to the molecular design of the polymeric system used. The aim of this
work is to improve the nanophase separation of some new double-cable
thiophenic copolymers (COPs) to enhance their long-term performance
in OSCs. The decamethylenic side chains of the synthesized thiophenic
copolymers have been functionalized with a C60-fullerene
and a photo-cross-linkable bromine group at different molar ratios.
The proposed structure is particularly intriguing since a single polymeric
chain is able to carry electrons and positive holes while, at the
same time, offering the possibility to chemically freeze the optimized
nanophase separation obtained after the thermal annealing procedure,
using a simple photo-cross-linking reaction. Therefore, the creation
of a single-component photoactive blend to achieve high-performance
OSCs with longer over-time stability seems to present a real challenge.
The homopolymeric poly[3-(10-bromodecyl)thiophene] precursor (PT10Br, Scheme 1) was synthesized
using a regiospecific polymerization procedure and then functionalized
with different amounts of fullerene. The obtained copolymers (COPs, Scheme 1) were completely
soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chlorinated solvents and were
fully characterized using chemical and spectroscopic techniques. The
molecular arrangement of COPs films was examined by atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), whereas the effects
of fullerene content on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the
OSCs, prepared using COPs as single-material components of the photoactive
layer, were evaluated. Finally, the over-time stability of the best-performing
photo-cross-linked cells was compared with the uncross-linked counterparts.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of COP Copolymers
Results and Discussion
The architecture
of a polymer-based OSC is made up of mainly three different layers:
a transparent anode (usually a thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO)
evaporated on a glass slide or on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) foil);
an active layer, where optical absorption and charge generation take
place; and a cathode of an evaporated metal (typically Al). When a
photon is absorbed by the active layer, which is essentially made
up of a physical blend of an electron-donor (ED) and -acceptor (EA)
material, it leads to the generation of an exciton, which is a Coulombically
bound electron–hole pair. The energy offset between the frontier
molecular orbitals of the donor and acceptor should then provide the
driving force necessary for the exciton dissociation to free charge
carriers (i.e., an electron and a positive hole), but this process
is usually hindered by the short lifetime of the exciton. Indeed,
in polymeric heterojunctions, exciton dissociation takes place at
the ED–EA interface and only excitons generated at a distance
shorter than their diffusion length are capable of producing free
charge carriers. In this context, the morphology of the active blend
plays a fundamental role because ED and EA components usually suffer
from marked phase separation, due to their immiscibility,5 when only homogeneous and interpenetrated blends
can effectively increase the number of dissociated excitons, with
positive effects on the efficiency of the solar cell.

In this
work, we report on the synthesis of a regioregular copolymer in which
the EA moiety (C60 fullerene) is covalently linked in the
side chain of a polythiophenic ED-conjugated backbone. Since the proximity
of the donor and acceptor units could lead to charge recombination
phenomena,16 we chose a length of 10 methylenic
units for the oligomethylenic spacer between ED and EA groups. It
is worth mentioning that the choice of the most suitable spacer length
is indeed very difficult; on the one hand, if the alkylic spacer is
too long, the glass-transition temperature of the polymer can be lower
than the room temperature, leading to poor filmability, whereas, on
the other hand, if the spacer is too short, the final polymer can
be insoluble in common organic solvents. In view of this, the right
length of the oligomethylenic spacer is a delicate interbalance between
thermal, physical, and morphological properties.

The synthesized
copolymer is particularly promising, as a single polymeric material
is able to carry electrons and positive holes (double-cable polymer).
About it, recently some authors reported the synthesis of a new double-cable
conjugated polymer resulting in a record efficiency of 6.3% in single-material
solar cells.17 Moreover, the proposed structure
can provide a faster inter- and intrachain transport of holes, a more
effective displacement of electrons along fullerenes, and a higher
interfacial area between the donor and the acceptor because segregation
phenomena are strongly limited. Basically, we prepared and characterized
three copolymer samples having a different fullerene content, to evaluate
the effect of EA concentration on the power conversion efficiency
of the device. The use of the postpolymerization approach has been
effective, facilitating the synthetic procedures required for the
obtainment of polymers with the desired amount of functional groups.18

Synthesis and Characterization
of Copolymers
The general procedure for the preparation of
copolymers is shown in Scheme 1. The precursor homopolymer PT10Br was obtained by means of
a regiospecific procedure, namely, the Grignard metathesis (GRIM)
polymerization, involving the cross-coupling of the organomagnesium
intermediate prepared by reacting 2,5-dibromo-3-(10-bromodecyl)thiophene
(2,5BT10Br) with a preformed Grignard reactive (CH3MgCl)
in the presence of the NiDPPPCl2 catalyst. Its characteristics
are shown in Table 1. PT10Br was then dissolved in anhydrous THF and added with Mg turnings
to obtain the corresponding ω-bromomagnesium derivative, which
was directly reacted with a solution of fullerene in toluene. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was also added
to the reaction mixture since the presence of polar additives can
improve the coupling reaction yield. Indeed, Matsuo et al.19 reported that polar solvents are able to enhance
the nucleophilicity of the Grignard reagent while stabilizing the
Mg intermediate.

The obtained copolymers proved to be soluble
in the tested solvents (CHCl3, CH2Cl2, CB, and THF) up to 30 mg mL–1 (COP1 and COP2)
and 15 mg mL–1 (COP3). However, a large amount of
insoluble fractions was observed when the fullerene content was further
increased during preliminary trials.

The Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrum of the copolymer COP3 is shown as an example in Figure 1a. The presence of
evident absorptions at 1429, 1174, 577, and 526 cm–1, which can be ascribed to C60 fullerene,20 confirms the expected substitution in side chains.

numbering for COPs. (c) 13C NMR of COP3 in CDCl3. (d) GPC eluograms of the synthesized polymers.

The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of COP3 are
shown in Figure 1b,c,
respectively. The spectra of COP1 and COP2 are very similar to those
reported before. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals
in the aromatic region, at 7.01 and 6.45 ppm, which can be ascribed
to the H-4 thiophenic proton and to the proton directly attached to
the fullerene group, respectively. The signals at 3.58 and 3.42 ppm
can be ascribed to methylenic protons α– to
C60 and Br group, respectively, whereas the ratio between
their relative intensities gives the fullerene content of the copolymer
(32% molar ratio, 1:0.83 polymer/C60 weight ratio). The
resonance of methylenic protons α– to the
thiophene ring is split into two signals at 2.83 and 2.58 ppm, which
are ascribable to the dyads originating from different monomer couplings:
the peak at the lower fields can be assigned to head-to-tail (HT)
junctions, whereas that at the higher fields to head-to-head and tail-to-tail
(HH, TT) junctions.21 The regioregularity
degree is given by the ratio of their integrated intensities (96%
HT), in good agreement with the values usually reported for GRIM polymerization
of alkylthiophene monomers.22 Finally,
the remaining signals at a higher field can be attributed to the central
methylenes of the side chains.

As detailed in Experimental Section, the 13C NMR spectrum of COP3
(Figure 1c) shows the
expected signals ascribable to the 3-(10-bromodecyl)thiophene and
3-(10-fullerenyldecyl)thiophene units. Moreover, the prevalence of
only four evident signals ascribable to the thiophenic carbons (at
139.21, 133.95, 129.71, and 127.93 ppm) further confirms the prevalence
of one kind of configurational sequence (HT–HT) in the copolymer
structure, as already observed by 1H NMR analysis.

The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of the precursor polymer
and of the three fullerene-attached copolymers produced the traces
shown in Figure 1d.
The small shoulder of the copolymers peaks at higher molecular weights,
which was not detected for the PT10Br sample, may be ascribed to a
small amount of aggregates or cross-linked products.23 Moreover, the GPC analysis shows the effectiveness of the
purification procedure adopted for the COP samples since any evident
peak was detected at around 27.8 min, corresponding to C60-fullerene elution time in the conditions used (Figure S1).

Spectroscopic
Properties
Figure 2a shows the absorption spectra of copolymers and of the physical
blend PT10Br/PCBM 1:1 w/w, shown for comparison, in CHCl3 solutions. We have chosen this weight ratio for the reference blend
since it represents the optimal composition for the commonly used
P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells.24 Spectra were
normalized at 264 nm, corresponding to the main absorbance of C60 fullerene.25

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PT10Br, the PT10Br/PCBM blend, and
copolymers in CHCl3 (excitation wavelength: 450 nm).

The absorption
at 452 nm (455 nm for COP2) may be ascribed to the polythiophenic
component and corresponds to the average conjugation length of seven
thiophenic rings.26 Moreover, the absorptions
at this wavelength decrease with the fullerene content, following
a trend similar to that determined by 1H NMR analysis.

A similar result can be obtained when observing the UV–vis
spectra of thin films cast by the doctor blade technique (Figure 2b). This time, however,
the behavior of the polythiophenic component was quite different from
the previous case. Indeed, the absorption of the conjugated backbone
was strongly red-shifted compared to that in solution: up to 547 nm
for the blend, 536 nm for COP1, 535 nm for COP2, and 533 nm for COP3,
corresponding to a mean conjugation length of 21 for PT10Br/PCBM and
of around 17 conjugated thiophenes for COP samples. These values can
be obtained using the semiempirical relation found by Jiang,27 which relates the length of the conjugated π-electron
structure nL with the wavenumber of the
absorption peak of the UV–vis spectrum  where A and B are constants determined for the
different conjugated polymers.

Furthermore, the presence of
an evident shoulder at around 600 nm, ascribable to the 0–0
pure electronic transition (E0–0), indicates the
existence of crystalline domains in the polymers since this absorption
is evident only in conformational ordered polythiophenic chains, which
are able to form interchain π–π stacking in the
solid state.28 The relative intensity of
the E0–0 transition is particularly evident in COP1,
COP2, and PT10Br/PCBM blend spectra, whereas it is less evident in
the COP3 sample. The results obtained suggest that the bulky fullerene
moiety, when present at high molar content (more than 21%) in a copolymer
structure, can lower the degree of order of polymeric chains. Moreover,
the comparison between the spectrum of the PT10Br/PCBM blend (Figure 2b) and that of PT10Br
in a film (Figure S2) indicates that the
fullerene-based EA molecules, also, can lower the conformational order
of conjugated chains in the solid state. Indeed, the presence of PCBM
causes the blue shift of the absorption maximum wavelength (from 558
to 547 nm) passing from the pure polymer to the polymer blend.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of copolymers, PT10Br, and the
physical blend PT10Br/PCBM 1:1 w/w in CHCl3 solutions at
about 10–5 mol L–1 polymer concentration
are shown in Figure 2c. The fluorescence spectra of PT10Br and PT10Br/PCBM blend are very
similar since energy transfers from the polymer to PCBM are very low
in diluted solutions. On the other hand, the photoluminescence decreases
significantly in copolymers; the reduction observed, which is roughly
proportional to the fullerene content, may be attributed to an efficient
photoinduced charge separation between ED and EA groups,29 facilitated by their close proximity.

Electrochemical Characterization
The
homopolymer and the three copolymers were electrochemically characterized
by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a polymer-coated Pt disk as the support
electrode, acetonitrile containing TBAPF6 as the supporting
electrolyte, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The PT10Br film showed
oxidation and reduction onsets at 0.77 and −1.08 V, respectively
(Figure 3a). These
values made it possible to directly calculate the energy of the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO = −5.17 eV), the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO = −3.32 eV), and the electrochemical
band gap (Eg,ec = 1.85 eV), considering
that the SCE reference electrode has a potential of 4.40 eV relative
to vacuum.30 The polymer energy gap was
also determined by the onset of its UV–vis spectrum in a film
(675 nm), giving a value (Eg,opt = 1.84
eV) very close to that obtained using the electrochemical method,
even if the comparison between the values obtained by different methods
can be misleading, as evidenced by Bredas.31

CV curves recorded in a 0.1 M TBAPF6/acetonitrile solution

PT10Br and PT10Br/PCBM; (b) three synthesized COP samples.

The evaluation of the electrochemical parameters for copolymers
and the physical blend was indeed more difficult. Indeed, since in
this case the reduction peaks of the polythiophenic component were
embedded with those ascribable to C60 fullerene (Figure 3a,b),32 the LUMO energy values were determined indirectly,
by considering the fact that they correspond to the HOMO energy and
the optical energy gap evaluated from the onset of the UV–vis
spectrum of the copolymer in a film.33 We
were encouraged to perform this evaluation by the very similar Eg values obtained in the case of precursor polymer
PT10Br.

However, we also tried to evaluate Eg using the onset of the reduction peak at lower potential
related to the fullerene moiety to calculate LUMO energy levels (LUMOec), obtaining the values reported in Table 2 (Eg,ec). These
values are in a good agreement with those determined by means of the
optical band gap (Eg,opt) even if the
trend does not appear the same; this is probably due to the difficulty
of assessing the exact position of the peaks in the reduction region
of CV spectra.

Table 2 shows the electrochemical data of the prepared samples calculated
using the optical band gap Eg,opt.

The electrochemical parameters of the copolymers and the PT10Br/PCBM
physical blend are similar to those measured for PT10Br, thus suggesting
that both the fullerene pendant group and the conjugated polythiophene
chain retain their individual electrochemical properties. Moreover,
all of the examined samples showed a HOMO-level energy, which is particularly
low in comparison to the value reported for the standard reference
P3HT (−4.8 eV),34 a characteristic
that is favorable for obtaining a high open-circuit voltage,35 with potential positive implications on the
conversion efficiency of the final devices.36

a Determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) in air.

The first heating run on a pristine
PT10Br sample (Figure 4a) showed (i) two endothermic peaks in the 35–85 °C range
ascribable to side-chain melting and (ii) a more intense endothermic
transition at around 158 °C, which corresponds to the melting
of the main chains. In the cooling process, a sharp exothermic peak
at 124 °C can be seen, possibly due to the crystallization of
the polymer melt.37,38 An evident second-order transition
(Tg) can also be seen at around 12 °C.
When the homopolymer is blended with PCBM, the melting and crystallization
peaks become less evident and shift to lower temperatures. The same
results can be observed in copolymer thermograms at increasing fullerene
content (Figure 4b),
thus suggesting that the presence of the sterically hindering fullerene
probably promotes the formation of less ordered and more amorphous
structures. TGA thermograms, recorded in air at a heating scan of
10 °C min–1 (Figure 4c), showed that the thermal decomposition
of the examined samples begins around 250 °C, whereas Td values tend to decrease with the fullerene
content (Table 3).
These results are in line with those obtained by Kumar et al.,39 who reported that the addition of carbon nanomaterials
to P3HT reduced its thermal stability. The relatively high decomposition
temperatures of all of the samples, however, make them suitable for
the thermal treatments provided for the assembling of the final OSCs.

from cooling scans. (c) TGA graphs recorded in air at a 10 °C
min–1 scan rate. (d) X-ray diffractograms of PT10Br,
PT10Br/PCBM, COP1, COP2, and COP3 reported in a range of 2θ

PT10Br, the PT10Br:PCBM 1:1 w/w physical blend, and fullerene-attached
copolymers films were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction after the
annealing procedure used for the preparation of the photovoltaic cells
(120 °C, 30 min, 10–3 mmHg).

All of the
samples show diffraction peaks at low angles (Figure 4d), ascribable to a lamellar structure usually
observed in crystalline regioregular polyalkylthiophenes. The d-spacings of the diffraction from (100) slowly increase
from 20.83 to 21.91 Å with fullerene content, and a similar trend
can also be observed for the diffraction from the (010) π–π
stacking distance (Table 4). These results indicate that the presence of the bulky-group
fullerene can effectively hinder the crystalline packing of the thiophenic
component of the polymers, as already suggested by thermal analysis,
but not to the point where the crystallization becomes impossible.
It is interesting to note that the physical blend shows larger and
less intense peaks when compared to copolymer patterns, as well as
longer in-plane and stacking distances, thus indicating a decreased
structural order and macromolecules packing in the PT10Br/PCBM sample.

Morphological Characterizations
Both atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) were used to investigate the effects of material
chemical composition and fullerene content in the polythiophene copolymers
on the nano- and microstructure of the organic solar cells (Figure 5). Figure 5a shows the morphology of an
active layer made by PT10Br. As is evident by observing the FE-SEM
images as well as the AFM topography, the material is extremely flat
and does not present any typical morphological features. Additionally,
the AFM phase image confirms the uniformity of the sample structure
and the absence of phase separation. The effect of the copolymer fullerene
content on the nano- and microstructuration of the single-material
double-cable layer (Figure 5b–d) reveals the significance of the chemical structure
optimization in fabricating well-developed polymer structures and,
in turn, enhancing the solar cell efficiency. The thin-film morphology
of single-material active layers made up by COP1, COP2, and COP3 was
significantly affected by the relative concentration of the fullerene-bearing
monomer in the copolymer chain. The COP1 thin film showed a relatively
smooth surface compared to other copolymer-based materials, but it
was rougher than the PT10Br layer. SEM images shown in Figure 5b highlighted a low number
of microsized features, whereas AFM images demonstrated the presence
of the typical double-cable polymer nanostructuration. As can be seen
in Figure 5c, the increase
in fullerene concentration affected the microstructure of the active
layer, which became more evident, whereas the nanostructure remained
stable even though the copolymer reached a molar content of C60-functionalized side chains of 21%, as in the case of COP2.
When the concentration of a bulky group such as a fullerene became
very high (COP3, Figure 5d), both the micro- and nanostructures were affected by the aggregation
tendency of the fullerene. The microscale structure was completely
dominated by the presence of large aggregates; most importantly, even
the nanoscale phase separation (which is of main importance to achieve
satisfactory efficiencies) was affected by the presence of C60 fullerene, thus confirming the previous results obtained by DSC
and XRD. Finally, the developed copolymer materials were compared
with a typical BHJ active material produced by a physical PT10Br/PCBM
blend (Figure 5e).
The inclusion of PCBM led to increased roughness compared to the pure
material layer shown in Figure 5a, mainly due to the formation of the typical BHJ nanoscale
phase separation.

Solar Cell Fabrication
and Performance
A series of OSCs with the structure ITO (80
nm)/PEDOT:PSS (100 nm)/photoactive polymer (150 nm)/Al (50 nm) were
prepared under the conditions described in Experimental
Section, with the aim of comparing the performance of copolymers,
used as single materials, with that of the physical blend (PT10Br/PCBM).
Current density–voltage curves of the devices are shown in Figure 6a, whereas the key
photovoltaic parameters (short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage VOC, fill factor FF, and power conversion efficiency PCE) are summarized
in Table 5. The reported
data are the result of the measurement of 10 devices for each sample
prepared under the same operative conditions. The device with the
copolymer at 21% molar fullerene content (COP2) showed the highest
PCE value, whereas the presence of a lower (COP1) or a higher (COP3)
EA content in the copolymer structure produced worse results. Therefore,
with a low fullerene amount, most likely, the ED/EA components are
not able to form percolation channels for the charge transport to
the electrodes.40,41 Indeed, even if COP1 shows an
intense absorption in the visible range (Figure 2b), its low performance could be related
to a lower degree of exciton dissociation at the ED/EA interfaces
and to a less efficient transport of the electrons to the cathode,
determined by the low amount of EA molecules. The COP1 sample shows
the lowest value of photocurrent (Table 5), and this fact is in agreement with the
results reported by Durrant et al.,42 which
observed that the Jsc value usually increases
with the increasing EA content. On the other hand, excessively high
concentrations of a fullerene can lead to aggregation phenomena and
hence to poor charge separation and electron/hole recombination. In
this context, it must be emphasized that COP2 showed a PCE higher
than that of the reference PT10Br/PCBM physical blend, suggesting
the attainment of an optimized morphology of the photoactive film
layer prepared with this single-material copolymer.

External
quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are compared in Figure 6b. Spectral profiles
were very similar, revealing a remarkable photocurrent response over
the absorption range 300–620 nm, with the exception of the
COP1 sample. The solar cell photocurrent densities (Jsc), calculated by integrating EQE spectra with the AM
1.5 G spectrum,43 were 7.23, 9.28, and
8.34 mA cm–2 for COP1, COP2, and COP3, respectively,
and 9.12 mA cm–2 for the PT10Br/PCBM blend. The Jsc values calculated from EQE spectra are very
consistent with those derived from J–V curves.

Solar Cell Stability
The morphology of polymer–fullerene layers should be effectively
controlled not only during the film formation but also when the device
is tested or used for its features. Usually, the thermal annealing
procedure is the first step toward optimizing the nanomorphology of
the photoactive layer.44 Indeed, heating
the active layer of the organic photovoltaics (OPV) cell makes it
possible for polymer chains to reorganize in a more crystalline structure
and for the fullerene molecules to diffuse into the blend and reorder
in a thermodynamically more favorable way. Annealing generally results
in higher photon-to-charge conversion at all wavelengths across the
polymer blend absorption spectrum and also in an enhanced mobility
of the charge carriers.45 However, the
obtained bicontinuous network with nanometer-scale phase segregation
is not thermally stable over time since the polymer–fullerene
nanoclusters are intrinsically thermodynamically unstable, as they
are created by kinetically trapping electron-donor/acceptor nanostructures.
Consequently, with the light exposure of the final devices (or in
the case of long storage times), the two components spontaneously
tend to segregate, producing the original macrophase separation. To
enhance the phase stability of the prepared solar cells, a photo-cross-linking
procedure was applied to the synthesized copolymers at room temperature
by taking advantage of the presence of bromine groups in some side
chains.46,47 Photo-cross-linking was carried out on the
annealed photoactive layers just before Al cathode deposition, using
a Philips UV-C PL 11 W lamp (3.2 W@250 nm, λmax at
253.7 nm, distance of irradiation 5 cm) with an exposure time of 30
min. The right irradiation time was determined by exposing copolymer
films to UV light for different times; the exposed films were then
immersed in CHCl3 for 20 min, rinsed with methanol, and
dried. Film weights before and after CHCl3 dipping were
then compared. After 30 min of UV exposure, the copolymer films were
totally insoluble in the chlorinated solvent, proving the effectiveness
of the cross-linking procedure.

The thermal stability was studied
by submitting five samples of the better-performing OSCs (COP2 and
PT10Br/PCBM) to constant heating at 150 °C under a vacuum for
different times (up to 120 h) to simulate an accelerated aging (Figure 6c). Preliminary tests
were performed using a regioregular sample of poly(3-decylthiophene)
(PT10H) synthesized as reported in the Supporting Information, blended with PCBM (1:1 w/w). In this case, the
photoconversion efficiencies decreased to 23 and 22% of the initial
value for the unexposed and UV-exposed sample, respectively (Figure S3). As for PT10Br/PCBM and COP2 unexposed
samples, their PCEs decreased to 22% (PT10Br/PCBM) and 41% (COP2)
of the initial value after 120 h at 150 °C, thus evidencing the
intrinsic higher stability of the photoactive layer consisting of
a single-material double-cable copolymer, as compared to the conventional
polymer/PCBM blend architecture. The covalent linkage of the EA moiety
to the ED-polymer structure has a beneficial impact on the time and
thermal properties of the final device by reducing the mobility of
the two components. The effectiveness of the photo-cross-linking procedure
is proven by the results obtained with the UV-exposed samples, showing
very stable device performances even after 120 h of annealing at 150
°C
(49 and 69% of the initial device efficiency for the physical blend
and the copolymer, respectively). The results obtained clearly evidence
that the photo-cross-linking procedure is a fast and effective method
for enhancing the thermal stability of OSCs.

Conclusions
In this paper, we reported on
the synthesis of three regioregular photo-cross-linkable thiophene
copolymers with different electron-acceptor contents, with the aim
of preparing high-performance single-component organic photovoltaic
solar cells. The new double-cable donor–acceptor polythiophene
derivatives have been successfully synthesized using an easy and effective
postpolymerization approach on poly[3-(10-bromodecylthiophene)] (PT10Br)
by means of a Grignard coupling reaction with C60 fullerene.
The precursor polymer was functionalized with different amounts of
the fullerene, to attain the best compromise between the solubility
in common organic solvents and the photoconversion efficiency of the
obtained copolymers. The soluble copolymers were characterized by
GPC, FT-IR, NMR, and elemental analysis to find their fullerene content.
The homopolymeric precursor was also used to prepare a physical blend
with PCBM, which was used as a reference. The copolymer with the 21%
molar content of the fullerene showed the best-performing properties
and yielded a power conversion efficiency higher than that of the
reference blend (4.05 vs 3.68%), together with a slower decrease in
photoelectric properties over time. Finally, the stability of the
prepared cells has been further improved by photo-cross-linking the
brominated groups at the end of the side chains. The simplicity of
the proposed synthetic approach, which involves straightforward reactions
characterized by high yields, and the obtainment of soluble copolymers,
bearing versatile functional groups inserted in the terminal position
of side chains, indicate that the prepared donor–acceptor polymeric
hybrids may be valuable candidates for the next generation of solution-processable
single-material solar cells.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Commercially
available reagents from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)
were used throughout without further purification unless otherwise
stated; solvents (HPLC grade) were dried by standard procedures, stored
over molecular sieves, and handled in a moisture-free atmosphere.

Measurements
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian
Mercury Plus (400 MHz) spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as a reference.
IR spectra were recorded on Ge or KBr disks using a PerkinElmer Spectrum
One or a Bruker Alpha Platinum spectrophotometer. UV–vis spectra
were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 19 spectrophotometer using about
10–5 M polymer solutions in spectroquality solvents
in Suprasil quartz cuvettes (1 cm × 1 cm) or films on quartz
slides. Molecular weights were estimated by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) using CHCl3 solutions on an Agilent PL-GPC 50 apparatus
equipped with a μ-Styragel mixed bed column (Waters HR 4E) referenced
to polystyrene standards. Elemental analysis was performed by Redox
Laboratories, Italy. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh
FLSP 920 spectrofluorimeter using the same conditions described for
UV–vis analysis. A DSC TA Instruments Q2000 was used for the
thermal analysis in the −50 to 230 °C range at a rate
of 5 °C min–1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. Thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA) were performed at 10 °C min–1 in air using a TGA TA Instruments Q600. All electrochemical measurements
were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT204 (Metrohm) potentiostat/galvanostat
at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The polythiophenes
to be examined were deposited from chlorobenzene solutions on a Pt
disk that served as the working electrode. The working electrode,
counter electrode (Pt wire), and reference electrode (aqueous saturated
calomel electrode) were immersed in an acetonitrile solution with
tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M)
as the supporting electrolyte using a one-compartment three-electrode
cell.

AFM images were scanned in the tapping mode in air, using
an atomic force microscope (Ntegra, NT-MD) equipped with a rectangular
silicon cantilever (HA_NC, NT-MDT, nominal spring constant of 12 N
m–1, and tip curvature radius smaller than 10 nm).
The sample size taken was 3.0 μm × 3.0 μm at a scan
rate of 0.5 Hz, whereas the drive frequency of the cantilever was
approximately 235 kHz. Field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI) was used at an accelerating voltage
of 10 kV and a working distance of around 4 mm, to image the surface
of the samples. An 8 nm thick gold layer was used for coating the
samples prior to observations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
polymer films were obtained by a Philips PW1050–PW1710 system
(Cu Kα radiation).

Photovoltaic
Cell Fabrication and Measurements
An indium tin oxide-coated
glass substrate was cleaned with solvents and etched on one side.
A thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonic
acid (PEDOT:PSS, 1.4 wt % dispersion in water/isopropanol, viscosity
20 cps) was deposited using the doctor blade (DB, Sheen Instrument
Model S265674) onto the ITO glass substrate and heated at 130 °C
for 2 h at low pressure. A solution of 5 mg of COP (or PT10Br/PCBM
1:1 w/w) in 1 mL of CB was deposited by DB onto the PEDOT:PSS layer
and heated in an oven at 120 °C for 0.5 h. Solar cells were then
completed by evaporating a thin layer of aluminum on the top of the
active layer using an Edwards vacuum coater (model 6306A). The fabricated
cells had the following architecture: ITO (80 nm, anode)/PEDOT:PSS
(100 nm; positive holes buffer layer)/photoactive layer (150 nm, COP
or PT10Br/PCBM)/Al (50 nm, cathode) and a final active area of 0.0625
cm2.

J–V characteristics of the devices were measured in air using a Keithley
2401 electrometer under simulated 100 mW cm–2 AM
1.5 solar irradiation provided by an Abet Technologies Solar Simulator
model LS-150, which was previously calibrated using an ILT photometer
model 1400-BL. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were
performed by means of an SCSpecIII (SevenStar Optics) solar cell spectral
test system. Layer thicknesses were measured using a Film Thickness
Probe FTPAdvances FTPadv-2 (Sentech GmbH, Germany) equipped with FTPExpert
software.

PT10Br
(0.200 g, 0.664 mmol) in 10 mL of anhydrous THF was added dropwise
to 2.43 mg (0.100 mmol) of Mg turnings under stirring and in an inert
atmosphere. The mixture was refluxed for 20 h, cooled down to room
temperature, and then transferred via a cannula to a solution of 0.072
g (0.100 mmol) of C60 fullerene in 300 mL of anhydrous
toluene and 1.5 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The reaction mixture was stirred for 90
min under an inert atmosphere and then 2.5 mL of a 1.87 M aqueous
solution of NH4Cl and 100 mL of brine were added. The organic
phase was washed several times with distilled water, dried with MgSO4, and concentrated. The recovered solid was exhaustively extracted
in a Soxhlet apparatus, first with methanol and then with acetone,
to remove the residual fullerene. The copolymer was then dissolved
in 10 mL of CHCl3, and the solution obtained was dropped
