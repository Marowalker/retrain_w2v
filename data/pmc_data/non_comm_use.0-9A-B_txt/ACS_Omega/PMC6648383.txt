Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
mass spectrometry (MALDI
MS) has shown its great success in the qualitative analysis of a wide
range of organic and biological molecules. However, its application
in quantitative analysis is still limited by the difficulty in the
availability of isotope-labeled internal standards. The present work
investigates the relationship between the correlation coefficient
of the peak intensities of analyte and candidate internal standard
ions and the linearity of possible quantitative analysis. Based on
the two analyte examples, ciprofloxacin and substance P, the results
show that the performance of the selected nonisotope-labeled internal
standard is greatly related to the correlation coefficient. A high
positive correlation coefficient (>0.7) between the ions of analyte
and candidate standard can result in a good linearity (R2 > 0.98) and vice versa. The results provide a new
way
to select nonisotope-labeled internal standards for MALDI analysis
and thus can be potentially applied in the rapid quantitative mass
spectrometry.

==== Body
Introduction
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
mass spectrometry (MALDI
MS) has been applied for the analysis of a wide range of molecules
since its inception in the late 1980s.1,2 Over the years,
MALDI MS has been an indispensable tool in related research fields
in chemistry and biology.3−5 Despite its good performance,
MALDI MS still has a significant limitation in quantitative analysis.5−8 Generally, there are two ways to solve this problem: modifying the
general MALDI approach or choosing suitable matrices to generate a
uniform distribution of analytes and matrices and applying internal
standards in MALDI analysis. For the first one, several groups developed
different ways to enhance the homogeneity of the target surface.5−18 For example, Thomas et al. reported that desorption/ionization on
silicon (DIOS) allows for the analysis of related small molecules
in the absence of matrix with a good reproducibility.9 Nie et al. used carbon nanodots (CDs) with excellent water
solubility as the matrix for quantified MALDI-TOF MS analysis of glucose
in serum.12 Gross and colleagues have reported
the use of ionic matrices in quantitative applications of oligodeoxynucleotides,
peptides, and small proteins, which have good calibration linearity
and reproducibility.10,13,14 Oh et al. have reported the use of the ionic liquid matrix, 1-MeIm-CHCA,
which has a good reproducibility to quantify polyhexamethylene guanidine
and obtained a good linear calibration.15

Practically, the second way is more widely used than the first
one. Internal standards are incorporated into quantitative mass spectrometric
analyses to compensate for both systematic and random errors during
analyses and provide reliable results.19−22 It is very important to choose
an appropriate molecule as the internal standard for the special analyte.
A good internal standard for quantitative analysis should have physical
and chemical properties similar to those of the analyte of interest
and should have an ionization efficiency comparable to that of the
analyte. Surely, an ideal internal standard is a stable isotope-labeled
form of the analyte. However, in most of the time, the isotope-labeled
standards are costly or commercially unavailable or even just unavailable
due to their great difficulty in synthesis. Hence, the exploration
of how to choose a nonisotope-labeled internal standard with stable
properties and low cost is urgent.

Thus, the key is whether
we can set up a method to find these nonisotope-labeled
internal standards. Sleno and Volmer have noticed the point and found
that the distribution coefficient, log D, could function
as a fundamental parameter for similar crystallization patterns of
analyte and selection of internal standards.22 Here, we devoted ourselves to fulfil the needs using a different
way with the aid of correlation analysis. Correlation analysis has
been applied for studying the mechanism of ion formation in MALDI
and other relative topics by several groups.23−28 For example, Feldman et al. used the event-by-event analysis method
to study sample surface heterogeneity and elucidate the mechanisms
of ion formation in MALDI-TOF.27 Using
this method, we have discovered the competition between metal cationization
and protonation/reduction in MALDI process of riboflavin recently.28 Briefly, the peak intensity variations of signals
can reflect the correlation relationship between the ions. In the
MALDI process, a positive correlation coefficient means the intensities
of the two ions increase or decrease together, indicating that they
have similar formation processes. In this study, we analyze the relationship
between the correlation coefficient and linearity of quantitative
analysis. The interesting results show how the correlation coefficient
can assist us to choose appropriate nonisotope-labeled internal standards
effectively.

Results and Discussion
In order to minimize the effects
on peak intensity caused by many unknown factors in the MALDI process,
the signal reproducibility is extremely important. Thus, besides the
widely used matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA),
the ionic liquid matrix of 1-methylimidazolium-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate
(1-MeIm-CHCA) was also selected here. The later matrix reported by
Yoon et al. has shown good reproducibility and been applied in the
quantitative analysis of polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG).15 To examine the signal reproducibility, the samples
of ciprofloxacin were prepared with both matrices of CHCA and 1-MeIm-CHCA.
For each of them, we collected 50 successive mass spectra at different
locations in the same spot by continuous moving the target in a zig-zag
way. The intensities of the protonated ions ([Cip + H]+) are summarized in Figure 1. Comparing with the poor reproducibility in the case of CHCA
matrix, the matrix of 1-MeIm-CHCA does show good reproducibility.
If other metal-cationized ions (such as [Cip + Na]+) were
compared, the results are similar. This is mainly due to the more
homogeneous sample surface generated by 1-MeIm-CHCA, which forms a
transparent liquid film on the sample. The spot-to-spot reproducibility
was also evaluated according to the five spots prepared in the same
metal target, and the standard deviation of the intensities of [Cip
+ H]+ is found to be less than 5% for the matrix of 1-MeIm-CHCA.
Briefly, the matrix of 1-MeIm-CHCA has a homogeneous surface and can
greatly reduce the sample-to-sample and spot-to-spot variabilities
and thus been applied in this research to explore the relationship
between the quantitative analysis and correlation analysis.

Figure 1 . Signal intensities

mass spectra using (a) 1-MeIm-CHCA and (b) CHCA as the matrices.

Ciprofloxacin (MW = 331.2) is
selected as the first sample to be
analyzed here, and six compounds are chosen as candidates for internal
standards. All their structures are shown in Scheme 1. In the present study, the MALDI-TOF mass
spectra were acquired for ciprofloxacin prepared at different concentrations
(from 5 μM to 1.5 mM), with D8-ciprofloxacin, sarafloxacin,
enrofloxacin, enalapril, 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine, and quinidine
added at a fixed concentration as internal standards. Figure 2 shows the representative mass
spectra of ciprofloxacin obtained under four different concentrations,
with sarafloxacin as the internal standard. Signals from the analyte,
including [Cip + H]+, [Cip + Na]+, [Cip + K]+, and those from internal standard, were observed. When the
ciprofloxacin concentration was less than 5 μM, no ciprofloxacin
signal was detected. When its concentration was higher than 1.5 mM,
the internal standard signal was too weak. Therefore, the concentration
range of ciprofloxacin was selected from 5 μM to 1.5 mM when
the internal standard was fixed at 0.3 mM in all these experiments.

mass spectra of ciprofloxacin at different concentrations

μM, with sarafloxacin as the internal standard.

Scheme 1 Compounds Used in the Study of Ciprofloxacin and Their
Molecular
Weights Are Also Shown
In some cases, the metal-cationized signals of internal
standards
cannot be observed in the mass spectra. Thus, protonated ions of [Cip
+ H]+ and the internal standard ([IS + H]+)
were applied here for the quantitative analysis. Calibration plots
based on log10 (IAN/IIS) versus log10 [analyte] are shown
in Figure 3, in which
the peak intensities of the analyte and internal standard observed
in mass spectra are indentified as IAN and IIS, and the concentration of the
analyte in the solution is r indentified as [analyte]. Figure 3a shows the calibration
curve obtained with the internal standard of D8-ciprofloxacin. As
expected, the standard isotope-labeled compound does behave as an
ideal internal standard. A very good linearity was obtained, and the
linear correlation coefficient (R2) was
reported to be 0.9985. The two peaks of [Cip + H]+ and
[D8-Cip + H]+ are found to be greatly positively correlated,
with all correlation coefficients between IAN and IIS obtained under nine concentrations
satisfied r > 0.93 (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 . Calibration plots for ciprofloxacin obtained
with different candidate
internal standards: (a) D8-ciprofloxacin, (c) sarafloxacin, (e) enrofloxacin,
(g) enalapril, (i) 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine and (k) quinidine.
The logarithmic ratios of (ICip/IIS) are plotted vs the logarithm of the ciprofloxacin
concentration. Their corresponding correlation coefficients obtained
under different concentrations are shown in (b), (d), (f), (h), (j),
and (l), in turn.

When sarafloxacin was
applied as the internal standard, the linearity
decreased to 0.9871. And it is also found that the ions of [Cip +
H]+ and [Sar + H]+ are greatly positively correlated,
with all other correlation coefficients satisfied r > 0.90, except the ones at the three lowest concentrations (Figure 1b,c). Enrofloxacin
gives similar results. As shown in Figure 1d,e, the correlation coefficients of enrofloxacin
and ciprofloxacin were found to be larger than 0.8, except for the
cases with the lowest and highest concentrations, and the linearity
is 0.9875. While for enalapril, the average correlation coefficient
decreases and the linearity also decreases to 0.9777 (Figure 2g,h). As a negative example,
3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine was also selected as a failed internal
standard for ciprofloxacin due to its different physical and chemical
properties. Not surprisingly, the linearity was just R2 = 0.8658. Interestingly, the correlation coefficients
obtained under different concentrations have negative values from
−0.3 to −0.8. High values of standard deviations were
also observed.

As a different example, quinidine does not belong
to the group
of 4-quinolones. The compound is an antibiotic with a different structure
from ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, Sleno and Volmer have found that
it can be used as a good internal standard for quantitative MALDI
analysis of ciprofloxacin (with a linearity of 0.99).22 Here, quinidine was also tested. The results are shown
in Figure 3i. It is
also found that quinidine and ciprofloxacin have a very strong positive
correlation. Except for the lowest concentration example, the correlation
coefficients are all above 0.85. Correspondingly, it is believed that
quinidine can be applied as a good internal standard, and it is proved
by the experimental results shown in Figure 3k, in which the linearity was R2 = 0.9954.

In order to further prove the relationship
between the correlation
coefficient and linearity, substance P, an undecapeptide, was selected
as the second example. Three different kinds of compounds: angiotensin
II, β-CD, and C60 were chosen as internal standards.
Among them, angiotensin II is also a peptide and the latter two are
totally different compounds with very different chemical compositions
and properties, which are purposely selected here as negative examples.
Calibration curves and correlation results are presented in Figure 4. The concentrations
of substance P were prepared from 1 μM to 425 μM in these
experiments. Not surprisingly, the results show that angiotensin II
has the best linearity with R2 = 0.9944
and good correlation coefficients with all values of r larger than 0.85 except for the experiment with the lowest concentration
of substance P at 1 μM (Figure 5a,b). When β-CD was applied as the internal standard,
the linearity decreased to 0.9615, and the correlation coefficients
also became weak. As another example with poor correlation coefficients,
fullerene of C60 was also tested here. The results show
weak negative correlation coefficients and very poor linearity. It
also indicates that if the compound and analyte have a weak correlation,
the compound is not suitable for acting as an internal standard.

Figure 4 . Calibration
plots for substance P obtained with different candidate
internal standards: (a) angiotensin II, (c) β-CD, and (e) C60. The logarithmic ratios of (IAN/IIS) are plotted vs the logarithm of
the substance P concentration. Their corresponding correlation coefficients
obtained under different concentrations are shown in (b), (d), and
(f), in turn.

Figure 5 . Calibration plots for
(a) ciprofloxacin obtained with the internal
standard of sarafloxacin and (c) substance P obtained with the internal
standard angiotensin II. Their corresponding correlation coefficients
obtained under different concentrations are shown in (b) and (d),
respectively. Both logarithmic ratios of (IAN/IIS) are plotted vs the logarithm of
the analyte concentration, and the values of IAN and IIS are taken from sodiated
ions of [Analyte + Na] + and [IS + Na]+, respectively.

In order to make sure the performability of the
method in the quantitative
mass spectrometry analysis for realistic samples, urine samples were
also tested here. Standard solutions of ciprofloxacin with different
concentrations were prepared by dissolving the compound in fresh human
urine samples, and sarafloxacin was selected as the internal standard
here. Both ciprofloxacin and sarafloxacin can be directly detected
in the forms of [Cip + H]+, [Cip + Na]+, [Cip
+ K]+, [Sar + H]+, [Sar + Na]+, and
[Sar + K]+. It has been found that all the protonated pairs
and metal-cationized pairs could be applied for the quantitative analysis.
As shown in Figure 4a, the calibration curve was plotted according to logarithmic values
of ratios of I[Sar + Na]+/I[Cip + Na]+. A good linearity with R2 = 0.9885 in the concentration range of 0.01–1.5
mM was observed, very close to the results shown in Figure 2c,d. Correspondingly, except
for the two cases with the lowest concentrations, all other correlation
coefficients are larger than 0.8 (Figure 5b). For the case of substance P in the urine
sample with the angiotensin II as the internal standard, similar results
were observed (Figure 5c,d). These experimental results do reflect the potential of the
method in real sample analysis. However, further systematic studies
about its performability are still needed very much.

Through
the analyses of correlation coefficients and linearity
shown above, it is believed that the performance of a candidate internal
standard is greatly related to the correlation coefficients between
it and the analyte reflected in the MALDI experiments. The higher
the correlation coefficient, the better linearity can be achieved.
If the correlation coefficient is below 0.7, the compound is suggested
to be not suitable as an internal standard of the analyte. Practically,
the method can be used to screen the best internal standards from
some candidates with kinds of structural similarities to the analyte.
It starts from the analysis of correlation coefficients among the
candidates and analyte and then the candidates with high correlation
coefficients with the analyte are preferentially selected for further
linearity test.

Conclusions
The present work investigates
the selection of internal standards
for quantitative analyses using the method of MALDI mass spectrometry.
In order to discover the relationship between the correlation coefficient
and quantitative analysis, spot-to-spot and shot-to-shot differences
should be reduced. In order to perform this, the ionic liquid matrix
of 1-MeIm-CHCA was applied here to obtain homogeneous sample spots.
Two kinds of analytes (ciprofloxacin and substance P) were selected
here. It is observed that the performance of the candidate internal
standard is greatly related to the correlation coefficients between
it and the analyte. When the corresponding ions of the candidate internal
standard and the analyte of interest are highly positively correlated
(>0.7), the candidate might be used as a good internal standard.
The
higher the correlation coefficient is, the better the linearity of
the calibration curve and the less the standard deviation are. The
results provide a new way to help us select internal standards for
quantitative MALDI analysis and thus can be potentially applied in
the field, especially in cases when the isotope-labeled standards
are unavailable.

Methods
Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Reagents
D8-ciprofloxacin hydrochloride
hydrate, angiotensin II (human), substance P acetate salt hydrate,
CHCA, and 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine dihydrate were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were obtained from
Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China). Sarafloxacin was purchased from
J&K Scientific Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). β-cyclodextrin
was purchased from Aladdin ( Shanghai, China). C60 was
purchased from TCL (Shanghai, China).

Sample Preparation
The ionic liquid matrix of 1-MeIm-CHCA
was prepared using the method previously described.15 Briefly, 1 mL of CHCA (0.2 mol/mL in MeOH) was thoroughly
mixed with 0.15 mol of liquid 1-methylimidazole by vortexing and sonicating
for 10 min. The mixture was then allowed to react at room temperature
for 10 min and dried under nitrogen. The dried, yellowish product
was dissolved in MeOH at a concentration of 70 mg/mL, and this solution
was used as an ionic liquid matrix.

Ciprofloxacin and substance
P were selected as the target analytes in the experiments. Standard
solutions of ciprofloxacin and substance P were prepared by directly
dissolving the corresponding chemicals in water at concentrations
of 3 mM and 0.85 mM as stock solution, respectively. For ciprofloxacin,
the stock solution was then diluted to become solutions with different
concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 150, 300, 600, and 1500 μM.
Sarafloxacin enrofloxacin, enalapril, and quinidine were prepared
with a concentration of 0.3 mM in water when they were used as internal
standards, while D8-ciprofloxacin and 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine
were prepared with concentrations of 0.1 and 10 mM, respectively.
Solutions of substance P were prepared by gradient dilution to become
solutions with different concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 40, 80, 100,
150, 250, and 425 μM. The concentrations of angiotensin II and
β-cyclodextrin were both chosen to be 0.1 mM, and that of C60 was 3 mM.

The urine sample was collected from a healthy
female volunteer.
After a centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min, the top two-thirds
of the urine was transferred into tubes. After that, 10 μL of
the analyte was premixed with 10 μL of 1-MeIm-CHCA matrix in
a centrifuge tube, and then, the mixture was diluted 20 times with
water. Then 1 μL of the resulting solution was deposited on
the target plate and air-dried for further MS analysis.

MALDI-TOF
MS
Data were acquired using a Bruker Daltonics MALDI time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometer (Autoflex III) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser
at a wavelength of 355 nm. The repetition rate of the laser is 20
Hz. The instrument was operated in a positive ion reflection mode
under delayed extraction condition with a source potential of 17 kV.
Each mass spectrum reported here was calibrated automatically using
the charged ion species from the matrices of CHCA by an external spot
nearby before the start of each acquisition. Each spectrum was acquired
by accumulating ion signals of 500 consecutive laser shots obtained
on the same sample spot. Each correlation coefficient is calculated
based on 20 mass spectra by continuous acquisition without any selection.

Covariance
Mapping
The correlation coefficient is calculated
by 1  in which C(x,y) is the covariance
matrix, and it is calculated
by 2  where xi and yi represent
the ion signal intensities at the ith point; x̅ and y̅ are the mean signal
intensities at the same point for all measured mass spectra. The total
number of experiments is indicated by n.
