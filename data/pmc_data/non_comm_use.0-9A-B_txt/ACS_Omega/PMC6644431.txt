Interactions
between inverted cucurbit[7]uril (iQ[7]) and essential
amino acids have been studied at pH = 7.0 by 1H NMR spectroscopy,
electronic absorption spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry,
and mass spectrometry. The interactions can be divided into three
binding types at pH = 7.0. Experimental results from the present study
showed that the host displays a strong binding to the aromatic amino
acids, Trp and Phe, and the guests of Lys, Arg, and His lie outside
the cavity portal of the host. Meanwhile, the alkyl moieties of the
guests Met, Leu, and Ile were accommodated within the cavity of iQ[7],
but there was no significant interaction between iQ[7] and Thr or
Val. The complexation behavior of iQ[7] with essential amino acids
was explored at pH = 3, and the binding of Lys, Arg, and His revealed
an unexpected behavior, with their side chains located in the cavity
of iQ[7], whereas those of the aromatic Trp and Phe were deeper within
the iQ[7] cavity. The alkyl side chains of the guests Met, Leu, Ile,
Thr, and Val were also located inside the iQ[7] cavity and formed
the host–guest complexes.

Introduction
In recent years, molecular
recognition in biomolecules has attracted
considerable attention,1−4 especially regarding amino acids and aromatic peptides. As the building
blocks of proteins, amino acids are essential components of life processes
and play critical roles in metabolism growth and development. A lack
of any essential amino acids can lead to an abnormal physiological
function and eventually to diseases such as nutritional imbalances,
Alzheimer’s, and pancreatitis.

Research on amino acid
and aromatic peptide complexation and recognition
by cyclodextrins,5 calixarenes,6 pillararenes,7 and
other macrocyclic receptors has been reported. The novel family of
macrocycles, cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s, where n = 5–8, 10, and 13–15),8−12 can selectively accommodate and interact with various organic molecules.
Several examples of interactions of amino acids with different members
of the cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s)13−18 have been described. Thuéry built chiral assemblies l-Cys-lanthanide–Q[6] complexes using l-cysteine as
a chiral linker;19a Gamal-Eldin’s
work on the selective molecular recognition of methylated lysines
and arginines by Q[7] had been reported;19b and supramolecular structures of tryptophan with Q[6] showed a very
interesting and peculiar structure.20 Kim
et al. explored the specific high-affinity binding of Q[7] to amino
acids (Lys, Arg, and His and Phe, Tyr, and Trp) in water.21 Urbach and co-workers observed the 1:1 binding
of phenylalanine derivatives to Q[7] and the binding of aromatic amino
acids to Q[8].22 Nau and co-workers did
some work of monitoring of amino acids based on self-assembly.23

Scherman’s group reported the first
example of the recognition
of a selected amino acid epitope within a protein by Q[8] complexation.24 Isaacs’s group obtained ‘‘turn-on’’
fluorescent sensors for amino acids using fluorescent cucurbituril
derivatives.25 In 2006 and 2016, our group
reported supramolecular receptors for the detection and recognition
of amino acids by TMeQ[6],26 Q[7, 8],27 and twisted cucurbit[14]uril.28 This area has seen a large expansion in the number of publications
on the binding of amino acids.

In 2005, Isaacs and Kim reported
the isolation, characterization,
and recognition properties of inverted cucurbit[n]urils (iQ[n]s, where n = 6 and
7),29 and some related properties of iQ[n]s were also described.30−32 However, to date, few
reports have focused on the newest member of the Q[n]s, iQ[7]. Our group studied the coordination chemistry of an iQ[7]
with a series of metal ions.33−35 To investigate the host–guest
chemistry of the iQ[7], we investigated the binding interaction of
an inverted cucurbit[7]uril with α,ω-alkyldiammonium guests36 and 4,4′-bipyridine derivatives.37,38 In a continuation of this research, herein, we explored the binding
of essential amino acids to the iQ[7] host to expand our knowledge
of the supermolecular chemistry of iQ[n]s. We studied
the binding interactions of iQ[7] with 10 essential amino acids (Scheme 1) in buffered solution
by 1H NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Meanwhile, we also characterized
the interaction between iQ[7] and basic amino acids at pD = 3 by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The experimental results provide new insights
into the interactions of amino acids and iQ[7].

Scheme 1 Structures of iQ[7]
and Essential Amino Acids Investigated in This
Work
Results and Discussion
NMR Spectroscopy
The complexation of iQ[7] with essential l-α-amino
acids was first examined by 1H NMR
spectroscopy of host–guest mixtures. Figure 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of Lys
recorded in the absence and presence of approximately 1.0 equiv of
the host in D2O, and D2O was adjusted to pD
= 7.0 with sodium phosphate. In the presence of iQ[7], the peaks for
all methylene protons of Lys display a substantial downfield shift
compared with those of the free guest, indicating that all methylene
protons interact with the carbonyl groups of iQ[7]. It has been reported
that the 1H NMR peaks of the guest protons inside the low-polarizability
cavity of Q[n] shift upfield, and interactions with
the carbonyl oxygen molecules of Q[n] result in downfield
shifts owing to the deshielding of the protons.21,39,40 Additionally, the signal corresponding to
the α-proton of the amino acid (Hα) is shifted
downfield (Δδ = 0.37 ppm). This indicates that the guest
is located just outside the portal of the host.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra
(400 MHz, pD = 7.0) of iQ[7] in the absence
(A) and presence of 0.15 (B), 0.40 (C), 0.70 (D), 0.82 (E), and 1.02
(F) equiv of Lys and free guest Lys (G) at 20 °C.

Similar iQ[7] complexation-induced 1H NMR changes (downfield
shifts and peak splitting) were observed for another two essential
amino acids, Arg and His, indicating similar binding modes. The results
of titration 1H NMR spectroscopy obtained using a fixed
amount of iQ[7] and various equivalents of Arg are shown in Figure S1. The side-chain proton (Hβ and Hγ) signals for Arg showed a downfield shift
of 0.04 and 0.18 ppm, respectively, and the signal for the proton
Hα showed a downfield shift of 0.29 ppm when the
iQ[7]–Arg ratio reached 1:1.02. As shown in Figure S2, the imidazole proton signal of His is shifted downfield
compared to that of the free guest, as are the peaks for methylene
protons Hβ and Hα.

This may
reflect the fact that Arg and His lie outside the portal
of the host, unlike the interaction of Q[7] with Lys and Arg.21 The possible reason leading to the difference
lies in the smaller cavity of iQ[7] which contains a single inverted
glycoluril unit.

The binding behavior of iQ[7] with the aromatic
amino acids Trp
and Phe clearly departs from our observations with Lys, Arg, and His.
As shown in Figure 2, all aromatic protons (Hγ–Hη) of Trp move upfield considerably and are broadened compared with
those of the free guest as a consequence of inclusion-induced shielding
effects. This indicated that they were averaged signals of the free
and bound guest molecules due to a rapid exchange rate of binding
and release on the NMR time scale. Meanwhile, one of the CH2 protons of Trp is moved upfield, which indicates that it is located
inside the cavity. By contrast, the proton Hα of
Trp moved downfield by 0.07 ppm when the iQ[7]–Trp ratio reached
1:1.05, which indicates that it is located outside the cavity. It
is noted that the two methine protons (H1 on Scheme 1) of the inverted glycoluril unit in the
cavity of iQ[7] were shifted upfield with increasing amounts of Trp,
suggesting that Trp also interacts with these methine protons (H1)
in the cavity of iQ[7]. These observations suggest that the CH2 group and indole moiety of the Trp guest are encapsulated
in the cavity of the iQ[7] host. This is also the case for the binding
interactions of iQ[7] with Phe; as shown in Figure S3, the aromatic ring protons of Phe are clearly subject to
upfield shifts upon binding to iQ[7].

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra (400 MHz, pD
= 7.0) of iQ[7] in the absence
(A) and presence of 0.18 (B), 0.40 (C), 0.64 (D), 0.85 (E), and 1.05
(F) equiv of Trp and free guest Trp (G) at 20 °C.

Meanwhile, the signal corresponding to the α-proton
of the
bound amino acid (Hα) is shifted obviously downfield
(Δδ = 0.13 ppm), similar to the binding interactions of
iQ[7] with Trp. This result is consistent with the binding behavior
of Q[7] with aromatic amino acids.21

The interaction of iQ[7] with Ile could be conveniently monitored
by 1H NMR. A slight upfield shift of the signals of the
protons of the alkyl chain (Hβ–Hδ) and a slight downfield shift of the signal of the Hα were observed upon the addition of iQ[7] (Figure 3), suggesting that there is a weak interaction
between iQ[7] and Ile. Similar 1H NMR spectra for the interaction
of iQ[7] and the guests Leu and Met were also recorded (Figures S4 and S5). This indicates that the alkyl
moiety of the guests was accommodated within the cavity of iQ[7] but
the interaction is weak. Meanwhile, no obvious shift was observed
when mixing the host with the essential amino acids, Val or Thr (Figures S6 and S7).

Figure 3 1H NMR spectra
(400 MHz, pD = 7.0) of iQ[7] in the absence
(A) and presence of 0.45 (B), 0.68 (C), 0.85 (D), and 1.05 (E) equiv
of Ile and free guest Ile (F) at 20 °C.

To compare the binding patterns of the essential amino acids
with
iQ[7] under different conditions, we also investigated the interactions
between the protonated forms of the amino acids and iQ[7] by 1H NMR titration at pD = 3. We first studied the binding behavior
of three basic amino acids with iQ[7]. A trace amount of the acid
was added together with iQ[7] to ensure the formation of the complexes.
With 1.0 equiv of Lys, Arg, or His, the proton of the side chains
of these amino acids showed a significant upfield displacement (Figures 4, S8, and S9), indicating the formation of complexes. Lys, Arg,
and His showed unexpected changes at pD = 3 compared with D2O because 1H NMR experiments confirmed that these amino
acids formed inclusion complexes with iQ[7]. This change in behavior
is likely due to a change in the protonation state.21 We concluded that the side chains of Lys, Arg, and His
were predominantly located in a shielded environment.21,39,40 This is because the binding to
iQ[7] causes His, Lys, and Arg to favor the fully protonated state.
As Kim reported before, paying the thermodynamic penalty for the protonation
of the carboxylate group is favored over the binding to iQ[7] as the
deprotonated form.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra (400 MHz, pD = 3) of iQ[7] in
the absence
(A) and presence of 0.35 (B), 0.75 (C), and 1.05 (D) equiv of Lys
and free guest Lys (E) at 20 °C.

For Trp and Phe, the amino groups of the guests remained
protonated
at pD = 3. Next, we investigated the binding interactions of the aromatic
amino acids Trp and Phe with iQ[7]. The interaction of Trp with iQ[7]
was studied first (Figure 5), and the results showed that the proton of the indole moiety
was shifted upfield, suggesting that the indole moiety of Trp was
located inside the cavity, as concluded previously. Upon comparing
the differences, it became apparent that the protons Hα and Hβ of Trp were shifted upfield, indicating
that the methylene and methine groups of the guest were also encapsulated
in the iQ[7] cavity. This conclusion was also reached for Phe. As
shown in Figure S10, all protons of the
benzyl moiety underwent a considerable upfield shift; meanwhile, the
Hα protons also experienced a small upfield shift.
These iQ[7]-induced shift patterns suggested that the benzene ring
and alkyl chain moiety of Phe were situated inside the iQ[7] cavity.
Overall, the results suggest that Trp and Phe guests were buried deeper
within the iQ[7] cavity. This indicates that the aromatic amino acids
can maintain their binding affinities reasonably well even if their
carboxyl groups are deprotonated, which is consistent with the results
of the binding of Q[7] with aromatic amino acids.

Figure 5 1H NMR spectra
(400 MHz, pD = 3) of iQ[7] in the absence
(A) and presence of 0.35 (B), 0.70 (C), 0.85 (D), and 1.05 (E) equiv
of Trp and free guest Trp (F) at 20 °C.

The host–guest interactions of iQ[7] with charged
amino
acids (Ile, Leu, Met, Val, and Thr) at pD = 3 were also investigated
by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of
Ile and Ile bound to iQ[7] are shown in Figure 6. All protons of the alkyl side chain of
Ile were clearly shifted upfield by between 0.23 and 0.41 ppm, indicating
burial within the iQ[7] cavity. Similarly, when the amino acids were
added to iQ[7] at pD = 3, the alkyl side-chain protons of Leu, Met,
Val, and Thr experienced a significant upfield shift, suggesting a
deep inclusion in the cavity of iQ[7] due to the formation of inclusion
complexes (Figures S11–S14). Upon
comparing with nuclear magnetic titration experiments in D2O, it became apparent that the alkyl side-chain protons of the guests
were shifted upfield, confirming that these four amino acids were
more likely to form inclusion complexes at pD = 3. Major binding differences
were observed (using NMR spectroscopy) between pD = 7 and 3, which
can be explained as a consequence of the different protonation state
for the carboxylate group. Upon the protonation of the carboxylate
group, the amino acid inclusion into the cucurbituril cavity is favored.

(A) and presence of 0.30 (B), 0.65 (C), 0.85 (D), and 1.05 (E) equiv
of Ile and free guest Ile (F) at 20 °C.

Ultraviolet–Visible Absorption and Fluorescence Emission
Spectra
The interaction of iQ[7] with Trp was also examined
by UV absorbance spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectroscopy.
According to the UV absorption spectroscopic results (Figure 7A), the gradual addition of
iQ[7] to Trp in buffered solution (pH = 7) was accompanied by a significant
decrease in the intensity at 218 nm and a slight bathochromic shift
because of the strong interaction between iQ[7] and Trp. As can be
seen in Figure 7B,
Trp displayed an emission peak at 366 nm at an excitation wavelength
of 269 nm. Successive addition of iQ[7] caused a decrease and a hypsochromic
shift from 359 to 350 nm in the fluorescence intensity at 359 nm.
These substantial changes in the emission profile further confirm
the strong host–guest interaction between iQ[7] and Trp. From
the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption and fluorescence
intensity, the binding constant (Ka) for
iQ[7]–Trp could be determined to be 2.32 × 104 M–1 and 2.68 × 104 M–1. Furthermore, Job’s plots (Figure 7C,D) based on the continuous variation method
clearly showed that the UV spectra and fluorescence spectra of Trp
fitted well with 1:1 stoichiometry of the host–guest inclusion
complexes.

1.9, and 2.0 equiv) of iQ[7]. ΔA (C) and ΔF (D) vs NiQ[7]/(NiQ[7] + NTrp) plots.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
To better understand
the host–guest interactions between iQ[7] and the 10 essential l-α-amino acids, we carried out at least two ITC experiments
at 25 °C in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Table 1 and Figures S15 and S16 show the equilibrium association constants (Ka) and thermodynamic parameters for iQ[7]–amino
acid interaction systems for Lys, Arg, His, Trp, and Phe. The experimental
results revealed Ka values ranging from
∼103 to ∼105 M–1 and negative ΔG° values ranging from
−25.4 to −28.2 kJ/mol for iQ[7]–amino acid interactions.
Thus, these l-α-amino acids could effectively bind
to the iQ[7] host. However, the amino acids Met, Ile, Leu, Thr, and
Val showed no effective interaction with iQ[7] (Figure S17). The revealed Ka values
indicated a strong binding with the aromatic amino acids Trp and Phe,
among which iQ[7] binds with Phe with the highest binding affinity,
which is consistent with the binding behavior of Q[7] with aromatic
amino acids (Table 2).21,41 The observations can be explained in terms
of a combination of ion-dipole and electrostatic interactions between
the positively charged side chains of the amino acids and the polar
carbonyl groups of iQ[7] and hydrophobic interactions between the
aromatic moieties of the amino acids and the macrocyclic cavity. From
the ΔH° and TΔS° values shown in Table 1, all intermolecular complexation interactions
between the iQ[7] host and l-α-amino acids guests appear
to be driven by favorable enthalpy changes, accompanied by small negative
(unfavorable) entropy changes. According to the NMR data, the interactions
between iQ[7] and Met, Ile, and Leu are relatively weak; meanwhile,
iQ[7] with Thr and Val shows no interaction. These facts might be
a reasonable explanation why the ITC experiments showed no effective
interaction of iQ[7] with these amino acids Met, Ile, Leu, Thr, and
Val.

Mass Spectrometry
We further studied the formation
of the inclusion complexes of iQ[7] and guests for 10 of the essential l-α-amino acids by MALDI-TOF MS. In the resultant MALDI-TOF
MS spectra (Figure S18), major signals
at m/z = 1309.012, 1336.526, 1317.864,
1367.793, 1328.397, 1294.573, 1294.498, and 1312.410 were observed,
corresponding to Lys–iQ[7] (calculated 1309.151), Arg–iQ[7]
(calculated 1337.164), His–iQ[7] (calculated 1318.118), Trp–iQ[7]
(calculated 1367.189), Phe–iQ[7] (calculated 1328.152), Ile–iQ[7]
(calculated 1294.136), Leu–iQ[7] (calculated 1294.136), and
Met–iQ[7] (calculated 1312.175), respectively. These intense
signals provide direct support for the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric
host–guest inclusion complexes for these eight amino acids.
It is noted that no significant host–guest interaction signals
were observed between iQ[7] and Thr or Val in the MS spectra. The
results of the mass spectra are consistent with the results from the
NMR experiments.

Conclusions
We explored the binding
interactions between 10 essential l-α-amino acid guests
and the iQ[7] host using a variety of
characterization methods in buffered solution (pH = 7). The experimental
results indicated a strong binding with the aromatic amino acids Trp
and Phe, and iQ[7] binds with Phe with the highest binding affinity,
which is consistent with the binding behavior of Q[7] with aromatic
amino acids. Lys, Arg, and His guests lie outside the portal of the
host, whereas the alkyl moieties of Met, Leu, and Ile guests were
accommodated within the iQ[7] cavity, and there was no significant
interaction between iQ[7] and Thr or Val. Additionally, interactions
between the protonated form of Lys, Arg, and His with iQ[7] were also
investigated at pH = 3, and unexpectedly, the side chains were located
in the cavity of iQ[7] under acidic conditions. Furthermore, the aromatic
amino acids Trp and Phe were more deeply buried in the iQ[7] cavity
at the lower pH. An upfield chemical shift for the protons of the
alkyl side chains of Met, Leu, Ile, Thr, and Val guests indicated
that they were located inside the iQ[7] cavity and hence formed host–guest
complexes. These results not only enhance our knowledge of the molecular
recognition of amino acids but may also be of significance for the
design and synthesis of new macrocyclic compounds for biological identification
and simulation.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Ten essential l-α-amino
acids were purchased from Aldrich. iQ[7] was prepared and purified
according to our previously published procedure.33 All other reagents were of analytical grade and were used
as received. Double-distilled water was used for all experiments.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Measurements
All 1H NMR spectra, including those for titration experiments, were measured
on a Varian INOVA-400 NMR spectrometer with SiMe4 as an
internal reference at 20 °C. D2O was used as a field-frequency
lock, and the observed chemical shifts are reported in parts per million
(ppm) relative to that for the internal standard (TMS at 0.0 ppm).
The ratio of amino acids versus iQ[7] was calculated by the ratio
of their integral areas for special peaks. The concentrations of the
amino acids were 1.0 × 10–4 mol/L in the NMR
experiments. D2O was adjusted to pD = 7.0 with sodium phosphate.
The value was verified on a pH meter calibrated with two standard
buffer solutions. D2O was adjusted to pD = 3.0 with 1 M
DCl. The pD = 3 of the solution was also verified on a calibrated
pH meter.

UV–Vis Absorption and Fluorescence Emission Spectra
UV–vis absorption spectra of the host–guest complexes
were recorded with an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer at room temperature.
Fluorescence spectra measurements were performed on a Varian Cary
Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon discharge
lamp at room temperature. The absorption and fluorescence titration
experiments were performed as follows: 200.0 μL of 1.0 ×
10–3 mol/L stock solution of Trp and various amounts
of 1.0 × 10–4 mol/L iQ[7] aqueous solution
were transferred into a 10 mL volumetric flask, and then the volumetric
flask was filled to the final volume with distilled water. The pH
was adjusted to pH = 7 with sodium phosphate.

ITC Measurements
Microcalorimetric experiments were
performed using an isothermal titration calorimeter Nano ITC (TA,
USA). The heat evolved was recorded at 298.15 K. The heat of the reaction
was corrected for the heat of the dilution of the guest solution determined
in separate experiments. All solutions were degassed prior to the
titration experiment by sonication. A stock solution (1.0 × 10–3 mol/L) of amino acids and 1.0 × 10–4 mol/L stock solution of iQ[7] were prepared with 10 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 7.0). A typical ITC titration was carried out by titrating the l-α-amino acid solution (pH = 7, 1.0 × 10–3 mol/L, 6 μL of aliquots, at 250 s intervals) into an iQ[7]
solution. The concentration of iQ[7] in the sample cell (1.3 mL) was
1.0 × 10–4 mol/L at pH = 7. Computer simulations
(curve fitting) were performed using the Nano ITC analyze software.
First points in the ITC data were excluded when fitting the model
to acquire the binding constant, enthalpy change, and entropy change.

MALDI-TOF MS
MALDI-TOF MS spectra were recorded on
a Bruker BIFLEX III ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometer with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
as the matrix. The MALDI-TOF experiments were carried out by adding
the l-α-amino acid solution (1.0 × 10–3 mol/L, 100 μL) into an iQ[7] solution (1.0 × 10–4 mol/L, 1.0 mL). The solution concentration was about 1.0 ×
10–4 mol/L (l-α-amino acids–iQ[7]
= 1:1).
