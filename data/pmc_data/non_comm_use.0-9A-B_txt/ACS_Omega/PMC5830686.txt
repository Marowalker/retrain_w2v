Introduction
of selectively chemical reactive groups at the cell
surface enables site-specific cell surface labeling and modification
opportunity, thus facilitating the capability to study the cell surface
molecular structure and function and the molecular mechanism it underlies.
Further, it offers the opportunity to change or improve a cell’s
functionality for interest of choice. In this study, two chemical
reactive anchor lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine–poly(ethylene
glycol)–dibenzocyclooctyne (DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO)
and cholesterol–PEG–dibenzocyclooctyne (CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO) were synthesized and their potential application
for cell surface re-engineering via lipid fusion were assessed with
RAW 264.7 cells as a model cell. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were incubated
with anchor lipids under various concentrations and at different incubation
times. The successful incorporation of the chemical reactive anchor
lipids was confirmed by biotinylation via copper-free click chemistry,
followed by streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding. In comparison,
the cholesterol-based anchor lipid afforded a higher cell membrane
incorporation efficiency with less internalization than the phospholipid-based
anchor lipid. Low cytotoxicity of both anchor lipids upon incorporation
into the RAW 264.7 cells was observed. Further, the cell membrane
residence time of the cholesterol-based anchor lipid was evaluated
with confocal microscopy. This study suggests the potential cell surface
re-engineering applications of the chemical reactive anchor lipids.

Introduction
The cell surface is made of a diversity
of biomolecules that govern
the biological processes of the cell, such as cell signaling, cell–cell
adhesions, and other extracellular/intracellular communications. Cell
surface re-engineering with biologically important molecules has scope
for potential applications such as cell labeling,1 imaging,2 and functionalization.3,4 In general, direct addition of biological functionality onto live
cell surfaces allows for the molecular level analysis of cell surface
phenomena and manipulation of cell functions as well. In addition,
introduction of chemical reactive groups at the cell surface enables
rapid and site-specific cell surface labeling and modification opportunity,
providing enormous capability to study the cell surface molecular
structure and function and the molecular mechanism it underlies. Further,
it provides potential opportunity to change or improve cell functionality
for different interests. Due to the growing importance for cell surface
re-engineering and its promising applications, several approaches,
such as direct chemical modification,5 membrane
fusion,6 and metabolic engineering methods,7 have been explored so far.

Macrophages
play pivotal roles in both innate and adaptive immunity,
most importantly in antigen processing and presenting processes. Therefore,
macrophages have been explored widely as drug/antigen delivery targets,8−12 drug delivery carrier systems,13−15 and also in transplantation/grafting
applications16 for the treatment of many
disease conditions.17 Recently, macrophage-mediated
programmed cell removal has been confirmed as an important mechanism
in diseased and damaged cell elimination before programmed cell death.18 Based on this fact, a surface modification of
macrophages with nucleic acid aptamers, so-called “eat-you”
motifs, was proposed as it can bind to membrane proteins of cancer
cells and capture the cell.19 It indicated
that enhancing the selective adhesion of macrophage to cancer cells
may be an effective macrophage-mediated anticancer therapy. In this
study, we propose a cell surface re-engineering strategy of macrophages
with bio-orthogonal functionality via lipid fusion aiming to chemoselectively
label and modify the cell surface with biomolecules, paving a path
for potential biomedical applications of macrophages.

Direct
chemical modification-based cell surface re-engineering
has limited applications due to its low site selectivity. Metabolic
engineering approaches often rely on the cell’s internal machinery
and may inevitably perturb the cell’s physiology under investigation
and thus have limited capability for cell surface re-engineering as
well. Therefore, passive exogenous insertion of chemically defined
structures into cellular membranes via lipid fusion is an attractive
alternative approach for cell surface engineering.20−25 For example, lipid fusion has been a straightforward method for
chemical glycocalyx engineering through passive insertion of lipid-anchored
glycopolymers into the plasma membrane.26,27 In this study,
two chemically reactive anchor lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine–poly(ethylene
glycol)–dibenzocyclooctyne (DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO)
and cholesterol–PEG–dibenzocyclooctyne (CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO) were synthesized and their potential applications
for cell surface re-engineering with bio-orthogonal functionality
were assessed using RAW 264.7 cells as model macrophages. Specifically,
we systemically investigated the incorporation efficiency of anchor
lipids under various concentrations and at different incubation times.
The successful incorporation of the anchor lipids was confirmed by
chemically selective biotinylation of the incorporated DBCO functionality
via copper-free click chemistry (CFCC), targeting the biotin with
streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and analyzed by confocal
microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively (Figure 1). Next, the cytotoxic effects of both anchor
lipids upon incorporating onto the RAW 264.7 cells were assessed.
Further, the cell membrane residence time of the anchored lipids was
evaluated with confocal microscopy. This study suggests the possible
use of these reactive anchor lipids for potential cell surface re-engineering
applications of macrophages and other cells as well.

Results and Discussion
Lipid fusion has been reported as a useful cell surface re-engineering
approach by using lipid anchors.20−25 In this study, we systemically investigated the incorporation efficiencies
of two types of anchor lipids, CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO
and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO, and their further
chemically selective modification potentials. The terminal DBCO moiety
gives bio-orthogonal functionality for reacting with azide-containing
biomolecules via copper-free click chemistry (CFCC). CFCC is a widely
used biocompatible and bio-orthogonal technique employed for labeling
and modification of biomolecules and cells. The reaction can be performed
under mild conditions in aqueous buffers without a catalyst and in
high yields under reasonable reaction times. Therefore, the incorporation
of DBCO onto the cell surface is anticipated to be useful for the
coupling of many other ligands onto the cell surface, facilitating
many biomedical applications. Further, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
molecule acts as the spacer between the lipid head group and the terminal
DBCO functional group, which makes the anchor lipids water soluble
and facilitates a longer lifetime of the biomolecules introduced on
the cell surface.

Syntheses of Anchor Lipids CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO
and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO for Cell Surface Re-engineering
The syntheses of these anchor lipids were carried out by an amidation
reaction between commercially available DBCO–PEG4-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester group and amine-terminated
cholesterol and DSPE lipids (Scheme 1). First, monocholesteryl–PEG2000-amine was synthesized as per a previously described method.28 The amidation of monocholesteryl–PEG2000-amine with DBCO–PEG4-NHS ester in anhydrous
CH2Cl2 (3 mL) afforded anchor lipids CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO in 72% high yield. Next, DSPE–PEG2000–PEG4–DBCO was synthesized by
amidation of commercially available DSPE–PEG2000-amine with DBCO–PEG4-NHS ester in 72% high yield.
The resultant anchor lipids were purified via silica gel column chromatography
using a gradient mobile phase comprising CHCl3/MeOH. The
obtained products were characterized by both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra data.

and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO Anchor Lipids for Cell
Surface Re-engineering Applications
Incorporation Efficiency of Anchor Lipids into the Cell Surface
To investigate the anchoring ability of both cholesterol- and DSPE-based
anchor lipids in the cell membranes, RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were
directly incubated with different concentrations (5 and 10 μM)
of aqueous solutions of anchor lipids (CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO) for
20 min at 37 °C. The incorporation of the anchor lipid into the
cell membrane was detected by labeling with azide–PEG4–biotin and further detected by fluorescein-labeled streptavidin
(streptavidin-FITC), which was confirmed by confocal microscopy and
flow cytometry. As a result, apparent fluorescence signals were observed
for RAW 264.7 cells treated with both cholesterol- and DSPE-based
anchor lipids for 20 min in confocal microscopy images (Figure 2A2–D2). From the negative
control experiments, it is clearly evident that the cells did not
exhibit any fluorescence as that of both the cells treated with anchor
lipids but without azide–PEG4–biotin and
treated with azide–PEG4–biotin but without
anchor lipids because there is no binding of FITC-streptavidin (Figure 2E2,F2). Apparently,
the cholesterol anchor lipid showed higher fluorescence signals for
RAW 264.7 cells (Figure 2A,C) compared to DSPE anchor lipid (Figure 2B,D).

saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) followed by biotinylation via CFCC and
streptavidin-FITC labeling: RAW 264.7 macrophage cells treated with
CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO (A, C) and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO (B, D) with varying concentrations (5 and
10 μM) for 20 min at 37 °C in PBS (pH 7.4) followed by
biotinylation and streptavidin-FITC labeling; RAW 264.7 macrophage
cells treated with anchor lipids but without azide–PEG4–biotin (E) and treated with azide–PEG4–biotin but without anchor lipids (F).

Further, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated higher fluorescence
intensities for cells treated with CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO
followed by biotinylation. Nearly, 78–81% of the cells were
incorporated with CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO anchor
lipids (Figure 3C,E).
In comparison, relatively lower fluorescence signal was observed for
the DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO anchor lipids indicating
low amounts of incorporation (Figure 3D,F), whereas control experiments showed no fluorescence
signals (Figure 3A,B).
These results are well in agreement with the confocal data above,
further indicating a higher incorporation efficiency of the cholesterol-based
anchor lipids compared to DSPE-based anchor lipids. This may be a
cell type-specific phenomenon. It may be associated with higher levels
of raft-forming lipids in the membranes of the macrophage cells. It
deserves a future study in different types of cells to clarify this
cell type-specific phenomenon.

cells treated with
CHOL-PEG-DBCO (C, E) and DSPE-PEG-DBCO anchor lipids (D, F) in varying
concentrations (5 and 10 μM) for 20 min at 37 °C in PBS
(pH 7.4) followed by biotinylation and FITC-streptavidin binding and
controls (A, B).

Direct Anchoring of Biotinylated
Lipid Conjugates into the Cell
Surface
To further confirm the high incorporation efficiency
of the cholesterol-based anchor lipid, we next investigate the direct
anchoring of biotinylated lipid conjugates into the cell surface of
RAW 264.7 cells. First, the biotin lipids are prepared by treating
varying concentrations of anchor lipids (CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO) with
azide–PEG4–biotin for 1 h at room temperature
(RT), followed by direct incubation of the RAW 264.7 cells at different
incubation times. Both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results
imply that most of the cells incubated with biotinylated CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO lipids exhibited much stronger fluorescence
signals (Figures 4A,C
and 5C,E) compared to biotinylated phospholipid
(DSPE) anchor lipid, which showed almost no detectable signals (Figures 4B,D and 5D,F). These results indicate that there is uniform
incorporation of the biotinylated cholesterol into the cell membrane
with almost negligible signals from within the cytoplasm. As a comparison,
the direct incubation of preconjugated biotinylated lipid (Figures 4 and 5) gave a higher insertion efficiency compared to the two-step
click process (Figures 2 and 3) at the cell surface. Due to its highly
efficient surface-anchoring ability, further rate of anchoring studies
were conducted with CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO anchor
lipids.

and F) in varying concentrations for 20 min at 37 °C in PBS buffer

B).

Rate of Anchoring Biotinylated
Lipid Conjugate (CHOL–PEG2000–biotin) onto
the Cell Membrane
The rate
of anchoring for the cholesterol-based anchor lipid into cell membranes
was investigated at different periods of time. For this purpose, the
cells were incubated with different concentrations of anchor lipid
(5 and 10 μM) and for different incubation times (5, 10, and
20 min) at 37 °C in 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4). As shown in
the confocal microscopy image (Figure 6), the incorporation of cholesterol-based anchor lipid
was observed within 5 min and a higher fluorescent intensity signal
was observed at 20 min. Additionally, the rate of anchoring was also
determined by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 7), which also resulted in high fluorescence
intensities, thereby confirming that almost 99.9% of the cells were
incorporated with the biotinylated cholesterol anchor lipids synthesized
by the one-pot step procedure.

min; and (E, F) 20 min.

Retention Time of Biotinylated Lipid Conjugate (CHOL–PEG2000–biotin) into the Cell Membrane
The plasma
membrane is a dynamic structure whose components are constantly being
internalized and refreshed. The properties of the anchor lipids control
the fate of the extra molecules introduced onto the cell surface,
and the outcome of the desired cell surface re-engineering as well.29 As confirmed above, cholesterol-based anchor
lipid afforded a higher cell membrane incorporation efficiency than
the phospholipid-based anchor lipid. Furthermore, we investigated
the cell membrane retention time of the cholesterol-based anchor lipid
and its potential for cell surface re-engineering applications. The
copper-free click chemistry was done in 1 h, during which the internalization
may occur. Therefore, in this study, we used a biotinylated lipid
conjugate (CHOL–PEG2000–biotin) instead of
doing a click biotinylation on the cell membrane after anchor lipid
incorporation. We probed the dynamic behavior of the cell-bound biotinylated
cholesterol at higher and lower concentrations. Briefly, RAW 264.7
cells were incubated with 5 and 10 μM of CHOL–PEG2000–biotin for 30 min at 37 °C in 1× PBS
(pH 7.4), followed by confocal imaging with fluorescently labeled
streptavidin to track the remaining exogenously associated biotin
overtime. Interestingly, at the concentration of both 5 and 10 μM
of CHOL–PEG2000–biotin, the average fluorescent
intensity underwent a sharp jump at the first 30 min and then a straightforward
decrease (Figure 8).
This phenomenon can be explained by either a high concentration of
the cholesterol–PEG2000–biotin inserted on
the cell surface, which may bind less streptavidin-FITC due to steric
hindrances, multiple binding of streptavidin, or a fluorescent quench
of the bound streptavidin-FITC. To confirm this stipulation, we investigated
a low concentration of 2.5 μM of CHOL–PEG2000–biotin. Interestingly, the fluorescent intensity of bound
streptavidin-FITC underwent a straightforward decreased without a
high fluorescent signal jump, which indicates no steric hindrance
nor fluorescent quench of streptavidin-FITC binding at the low concentration
of CHOL–PEG2000–biotin inserted. Overall,
we found concentration-dependent incorporation rates of anchor lipid.
The retention half-life time of the cholesterol–PEG–biotin
is about 1 h on macrophages cell surface, which is shorter than that
from the cholesterol–PEG–glycopolymer in Jurkats cells
reported by Bertozzi et al.27 This may
be both lipid-conjugate and cell type-specific phenomenon.

Cytotoxic Effect of the Anchor Lipids and
upon Their Incorporation—3-(4,
5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay
To evaluate the effect of the individual anchor lipid on cell viability
upon and after incorporation, MTT assays were performed on the RAW
264.7 cell lines at different incubation times (20 min, 16, and 24
h) and at varying concentrations of anchor lipids. In addition, the
effect after biotinylation on the cell viability was also explored
for 20 min, 16, and 24 h, respectively. As a result, the anchor lipids
did not show any significant cell toxicity during incorporation and
after biotinylation for both two-step and direct biotinylation methods
(Figure 9). This indicates
that these reactive anchor lipids can be used for the potential biomedical
applications.

was determined by the MTT assay. Error bars represent the standard

Conclusions
In summary, the present study demonstrated
the potentials of anchor
lipids, DBCO-containing cholesterol- and DSPE-based anchor lipids
for an efficient and chemoselective cell surface re-engineering application.
The successful incorporation of the reactive anchor lipids and its
selective modification was confirmed by biotinylation via copper-free
click chemistry followed by specific interactions with streptavidin-FITC
under confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. The results
indicated the successful incorporation of cholesterol-based anchor
lipids with high fluorescence intensities from the cell membrane and
with little or negligible internalization when compared to the DSPE-based
anchor lipid. This difference in the incorporation efficiencies of
the anchor lipids can be attributed to the difference in their structural
characteristics and physiochemical properties. Furthermore, the cell
viability assay (MTT) study also revealed that the incorporation of
the cholesterol- and DSPE-based anchor lipids into the cell surface
did not cause any significant toxicity to the modified RAW 264.7 cells.
These results suggest the potential use of these reactive anchor lipids
for cell surface re-engineering applications. In particular, the copper-free
click chemistry can be used for conjugation of many important biomolecules
such as peptides, proteins, and carbohydrates, which allows for various
cell surface re-engineering applications.

Synthesis
of CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO
First, monocholesteryl–PEG2000-amine was synthesized
as per a previously described method.28 Triethylamine (Et3N, 50 μL, 0.35 mmol) was added
to the solution of monocholesteryl–PEG2000-amine
(100 mg, 40.4 μmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (3 mL) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature (RT) under argon

CH2Cl2 (1 mL) to the above mixture and continuous
stirring of the reaction solution for 48 h at RT. Thin-layer chromatography
analysis was performed to monitor the reaction. Then, the reaction
solution was concentrated to obtain a residue, which was purified
by silica gel column chromatography eluted with a gradient solvent
system (CHCl3/MeOH, 95:5 ∼ 80:20 v/v) to yield CHOL–PEG2000–PEG4–DBCO (92 mg, 70% yield). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 7.65 (d, 1H),

Synthesis of DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO
DSPE–PEG2000–PEG4–DBCO
was synthesized by following the method from previous literature,30 and is commercially available from Avanti Polar
Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama).

Cell Culture
The
mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7
cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL)
at 37 °C in 5% CO2 conditions. The cells were further
subcultured by trypsinization with (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) after cells became confluent.

Preparation of Anchor Lipids
Solution
A solution of
1 mg/mL anchor lipid in CHCl3 was prepared and then CHCl3 was removed by evaporation under a stream of N2 gas to obtain a thin film of lipids. The thin film was further kept
under vacuum for overnight to ensure the complete removal of any residual
solvent. The thin film was hydrated with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with
vigorous sonication and vortexing for about 3 h to form aqueous solutions.
Serial dilutions from the above solution resulted in 2.5, 5, and 10
μM aqueous solutions of anchor lipids for further studies.

The RAW 264.7 cells were
washed twice with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with different
concentrations (5 and 10 μM) of CHOL–PEG2000–DBCO and DSPE–PEG2000–DBCO anchor
lipids for different incubation times (5, 10, and 20 min) in 1×
PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. At each time point, the lipid solution
was gently aspirated, followed by washing three times with 1×
PBS buffer (pH 7.4), the cells were treated with 750 μL of Azido–PEG4–biotin (3 equiv of anchor lipid) (50 mM stock solution,
1× PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C). Then, the solution was
gently aspirated and the cells were washed again with 1× PBS
buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 750 μL FITC-streptavidin
(1:800 dilution, 0.5 mg/mL stock solution) for 1 h in darkness at
room temperature. The cell nuclei were stained by adding 3 μL
of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution. The treated
cells were washed, fixed by the addition of 4% PFE solution and set
aside for 10 min, gently aspirated, washed three times with PBS buffer
(pH 7.4), and finally mounted onto the glass slides (using Gold Anti-fade
Solution) for viewing under a Nikon A1RSI Confocal Microscope with
a 60x oil objective

by washing three times with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4) between each
step. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides ProLong Gold Anti-fade
reagent (Life Technologies). The slides were imaged using a Nikon

tube) were cultured overnight, washed three times with PBS buffer
via centrifugation (1200 rpm, 5 min), treated with different concentrations
of anchor lipids (500 μL/test tube, 5 and 10 μM) in 1×
PBS buffer (pH 7.4), and incubated for different time intervals (5,
10, and 20 min) at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed
twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) via centrifugation, aspirated, and
then treated with 750 μL of azido–PEG4–biotin
(3 equiv of anchor lipid) (50 mM stock solution, 1× PBS, pH 7.4)
for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed and then incubated with
streptavidin-FITC for 1 h at room temperature in darkness. Similarly,
cells were treated with biotin–PEG–lipids solutions
(5 and 10 μM) for different incubation times (20 min, 2 h, and
4 h) at 37 °C and followed by washing and incubation with streptavidin-FITC
for 1 h at room temperature in darkness. After further washing steps,
the fluorescence signal of 2 × 104 cells were measured
using a flow cytometer (BD-Canto).

Retention Time of Biotinylated
Lipid Conjugate (CHOL–PEG2000–Biotin) on
the Cell Membrane
RAW 264.7
cells were seeded into 6-well plates, with each well containing a
glass coverslip. After overnight incubation, the cell medium was aspirated
off and the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4).
The cells were then incubated with a 2.5, 5, or 10 μM CHOL–PEG2000–biotin solution (total volume 1 mL), or 1×
PBS buffer (pH 7.4) for control wells, for 30 min at 37 °C. The
cholesterol solution was aspirated off and the cells were washed twice
with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Fresh medium was added to each well
and the cells were placed back into the incubator. After a set time
point, the cells were removed from incubation, washed, and fixed.
The time points were 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after the removal of the
cholesterol solution. The cells at 0 time point were used as control
cells. At a given time point, the media was aspirated from specific
wells and the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS buffer (pH
7.4). The cells were fixed using a 4% para-formaldehyde
solution for 10 min at room temperature and then washed twice with
1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4). 300 μL of 0.625 μg/mL streptavidin-FITC
solution was added to each coverslip and allowed to set for 1 h at
room temperature. After the streptavidin incubation, the coverslips
were washed by submerging them twice in 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4)
for 5 min. After washing, 300 μL of 300 nM DAPI solution was
added to each coverslip and allowed to sit for 10 min at room temperature.
After incubation, the coverslips were washed by submerging them thrice
in 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4) for 5 min. The coverslips were mounted
on the slides by adding 30 μL of ProLong Gold Anti-fade reagent
to each coverslip and allowed to set overnight. The slides were imaged
using a Nikon A1RSI Confocal Microscope with a 60× oil objective.

Cytotoxic Effect of the Anchor Lipids and upon Their Incorporation—MTT
Assay
The cell viability of RAW 264.7 cells upon anchor lipids
incorporation was carried out using a MTT assay (Vybrant MTT Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit). Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at
a density of 2.5 × 104 cells per well in 96-well plates
overnight, then the medium was removed, and the cells were washed
with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The cell viability during incorporation
of the anchor lipid and its biotinylation process was assessed by
the addition of FBS-free culture medium with anchor lipids and incubated
for different time points (20 min, 16 h, 24 h) at 37 °C. In addition,
the cell viability after biotinylation was investigated as well. After
biotinylation, the cells were washed with 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4)
and placed back in the medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2, followed by the assessment of the cell viability at 16 and 24 h.
Briefly, the medium was removed by gentle aspiration, to which 100
μL of fresh culture medium and 10 μL of 12 mM MTT solution
were added and incubated for an additional 4 h. Subsequently, 100
μL of the sodium dodecyl sulfate–HCl solution was added
(10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl) and incubated for another additional 3 h.
Finally, the measurements were read at 570 nm using a UV–vis
multiplate reader. Similar protocols were followed for cell viability
assessments of biotin–PEG–lipids at different concentrations
(5 and 10 μM) and incubation times.
