The effect of Zr modification on
the catalytic activity of Co/SiO2 was investigated for
nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation.
Isolated Zr on SiO2 surface sites were prepared by organometallic
synthesis using Zr(OtBu)4 as
a precursor. The resulting Zr/SiO2 support was functionalized
with Co2+ ions via strong electrostatic adsorption. Spectroscopic
(diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, UV–vis,
electron paramagnetic resonance) and microscopic characterization
(transmission electron microscopy, scanning transition electron microscopy)
results are consistent with single-site cobalt that preferentially
associates with the mono-dispersed Zr at a variety of loadings and
Co/Zr ratios. The oxidation state of Co in the as-prepared Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 was both +2 with tetrahedral
and octahedral geometries, respectively. In situ X-ray absorption
near edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure results
confirmed that the oxidation state of Co remained as +2 under reaction
condition for both Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 samples and both catalysts have tetrahedral Co2+ as the
active catalyst. Despite similar Co coordination environments, the
catalytic activity and selectivity was significantly improved by the
Zr modification of the silica support versus Co/SiO2. This
was attributed to the change in oxygen donor ability and Co–O
bond strength of the ≡SiO–Zr–O sites of Co–Zr/SiO2 compared with the ≡SiO– ligands in Co/SiO2. These results show that tuning of the support SiO2 oxygen donation ability by use of an anchoring site (e.g., ≡SiO–Zr–O–) can be used to alter both rate and selectivity
of propane dehydrogenation with single-site heterogeneous catalysts.
These results also show some preference for Co2+ active
sites to associate with ≡SiO–Zr–O– sites over ≡SiO–.

1 Introduction
On-purpose
production of propylene via nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation1 (PDH) from conventional and shale gas streams
is of increasing importance for the olefin and chemical industries.
For this process, Pt–Sn and CrOx supported on alumina and silica catalysts are commercially available
today.2−5 These catalysts have been extensively researched in the literature
and the factors that affect their rate and selectivity are well-studied,
even if the precise method of modification remains unclear. For example,
Bariås et al. studied Pt and Pt–Sn catalytic systems on
two different supports Al2O3 and SiO2 for PDH. It was found that on both supports addition of Sn promoted
the catalytic activity and stability.2 Pt–Sn
alloys are believed to be superior to pure Pt because of the Sn increasing
Pt dispersion, decreasing propene binding energies (decreasing deep
dehydrogenation and coking), and breaking up ensembles of Pt atoms
that readily cleave C–C bonds.1−3,6 As might be expected, the support appears to play less of a role
in metallic-phase dehydrogenation catalysts than in dehydrogenation
catalysts with oxidized catalytic species. Many studies have been
reported chromium-catalyzed PDH, and it is believed that isolated
or low-nuclearity Cr clusters are the active catalysts for CrOx on both Al2O3 and
SiO2 for dehydrogenation4,7−9 and polymerization.10−15 Copéret’s group demonstrated that Cr3+ surface
sites were significantly more active than Cr2+ sites through
heterolytic C–H bond activation as the rate-determining step.7 There are clearly large effects of both the support
oxide and chromium oxide nuclearity.

Single-site catalysts for
PDH are particularly interesting as both
commercial systems (e.g., Cr and Ga) and as systems to understand
the fundamental organometallic reaction mechanisms operative in this
catalytic system. Over the past few years, we and others have studied
PDH catalysis with a variety of ions16−19 and found that the overall catalytic
rate of PDH by single-site heterogeneous catalysts is primarily governed
by one of two basic rate-determining steps: heterolytic cleavage of
C–H bond or β-hydride elimination of metal alkyl intermediates.7,19,20 The heterolytic cleavage of C–H
bonds appears to be rate-determining for the transition-metal catalysts
Co and Fe, whereas the β-hydride elimination is rate-determining
for main-group ions like Zn and Ga. In addition to the overall rate,
the catalytic selectivity of single-site catalysts for C–H
activation over C–C bond cleavage appears to be higher for
many nanoparticle catalysts. Previous work has shown that while isolated
Co21,22 and Fe23 sites
supported on SiO2 showed high propene selectivity during
PDH under differential conditions, where background thermal cracking
is low, the rates are relatively slow compared with Cr-based catalysts.
In a more recent study with Y and Sc single-site catalysts and in
computational study, we found that the M–O bond strength was
a more important descriptor for dehydrogenation rates than the overall
Lewis acidity.24 We reasoned that the catalyst-support
oxide bond strength would be more tunable than the rate-determining
β-hydride elimination of Zn and Ga catalysts, so we chose to
focus on tuning the Lewis acidity of the support for cobalt-based
PDH catalysts. For this study, we chose to prepare Zr sites on SiO2 as a test of this hypothesis that the rate of PDH could be
increased while maintaining (or improving) PDH selectivity.

Bulk ZrO2 has been proved to be a good support for chromium-based
dehydrogenation catalysts.25−32 De Rossi et al. reported that higher dehydrogenation activity was
observed over ZrO2 compared with SiO2 as a catalyst
support for chromium-catalyzed PDH.33−36 However, the low surface area
of ZrO2 (<100 m2/g)28,34,35 resulted in lower overall activity than
on Al2O3. For the purpose of fundamental study
in this work, there are a low number of hydroxyl groups on ZrO2, likely of many different types that strongly depend on dehydration
conditions (cf. Al2O3).37 For this reason, we chose to modify silica with zirconium sites
to generate a more well-defined material. For silica-supported catalysts,
the ligand can be viewed as ≡SiO–, though distributions
of ring sizes and hydroxyl types are also well known.38−40 Replacing Si with a highly oxophilic metal species, for example
Zr, will lead to ≡ZrO– which would be expected to be
a weaker electron donating group than ≡SiO–. Such an
effect was demonstrated during studies of metal–metal charge-transfer
features by the Frei group (cross refs) that showed a decrease of
the crystal field splitting energy in tetrahedral Zr–O–Co2+ sites versus Si–O–Co2+ because
of the electrophilicity of the Zr. Consequently, the M–O (M
is the isolated catalyst species) bond of ≡ZrO–M species
should be weaker than ≡SiO–M. Zirconium sites were grafted
on silica (Zr/SiO2) using Zr(OtBu)4 as a convenient starting material. Previously, the
grafting of Zr though organometallic synthesis have been reported
using various precursor compounds41−49 including Zr(CH2CMe3)4,50 [(ArO)Zr(CH2tBu)3],43 and Zr(NMe2)4.51 However, exploration
of zirconium and other metals as anchoring sites in well-defined single-site
catalysts is relatively unexplored. Zr promotion has been observed
for Fischer–Tropsch catalysis52−54 and Zr on silica is
a Lewis acid catalyst for converting glucose to 5-HMF (hydroxymethylfurfural)
through isomerization of glucose to fructose.31,55

Herein, we report the promotion effect of zirconium addition
to
the Co/SiO2 catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation
of propane. The change in chemical properties of both Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 were examined by multiple characterization
techniques, including under reaction conditions. Last, the effect
of Zr loading to the catalytic activity of Co–Zr/SiO2 and the implications for catalyst dynamic behavior is discussed.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Material and Methods
All manipulations
of air-sensitive materials were performed with rigorous exclusion
of O2 and moisture in oven-dried Schlenk-type glassware
on a dual manifold Schlenk line and in N2-filled atmospheres
glovebox with a high capacity recirculator (<1 ppm O2) unless otherwise noted. Solvents were sparged with N2, dried using activated alumina columns, transferred into the glovebox,
and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves prior to use. Unless specified,
all chemicals and other solvents were purchased and used as received
from Sigma-Aldrich and Strem Chemicals. Elemental analysis (% Co,
Zr) was conducted by Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. (Knoxville, TN).
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution of the samples were obtained using an
accelerated surface area and porosimetry system (ASAP2020) from Micromeritics.
The sample was first placed in a sample tube and held under vacuum
below 5 μmHg for 30 min. The sample tube was then degassed by
increasing the sample tube temperature to 130 °C for 12 h to
clean the catalyst surface. After degassing, the sample tube was transferred
to the analysis port where nitrogen was physiosorbed at liquid nitrogen
temperature. The adsorption isotherms were collected while increasing
the pressure of the tube until it reached to nitrogen saturation pressure.
BET surface area was calculated on the basis of the adsorption branch
of the isotherm, and the BJH pore size distribution was obtained from
desorption profile of the isotherm. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) characterization was performed by using a JEOL JEM2100F microscope
equipped with a field emission gun operated at 200 keV. The solid
samples were prepared by depositing a diluted sample solution (2.6-Zr/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Co-2.6-Zr/SiO2 suspended
in isopropyl alcohol reagent) on a sample holder (carbon-coated copper
grid) and characterized without further treatment. The energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data were collected on an Oxford Instrument
X-Max 80 mm2 Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) for EDX. The
scanning TEM (STEM) experiment was carried out using a FEI Talos microscope
operated at 200 kV. Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform
spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra were obtained using a Thermo Scientific
Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer. The sample was packed inside a Praying
Mantis reaction cell and sealed with a dome-shaped metal compartment
including two ZnSe windows. The reaction chamber was first flushed
for 30 min with He to optimize signal intensity. A sample spectrum
was acquired by using a MCT/A detector at liquid nitrogen temperature
where dried KBr was used as a background. DRUV–vis spectra
of the samples were collected by a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer—Shimadzu
UV-3600 Plus using a PMT (photomultiplier tube) detector. The catalyst
was placed on a sample holder under atmosphere condition and the beam
was aligned at the center of the sample. The sample spectrum was collected
at a medium scan speed with a slit width of 3 nm in the region of
200–800 nm. To have a stable baseline, polytetrafluoroethylene
was used as a background. All of the spectra shown in here were transferred
to Kubelka–Munk functions. Samples were treated with 3% H2/Ar using 30 mL/min of flow rate with increasing temperature
from RT to 600 °C to obtain temperature programmed reduction
(TPR) profiles. The reaction was conducted inside a quartz reactor
which was centered in a heated furnace. A thermocouple was inserted
into the quartz reactor to measure the actual temperature during heating.
A ramp rate of 10 °C/min was used. The effluent stream of the
reactor was connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to
monitor hydrogen consumption due to the sample. Prior to the experiment,
the 3% H2/Ar gas was first introduced to the reactor continuously
to obtain a stable TCD signal. Continuous wave (CW) X-band (9.48 GHz)
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were carried out
with a Bruker ELEXSYS II E500 EPR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten,
Germany), equipped with a TE102 rectangular EPR resonator
(Bruker ER 4102ST). A helium gas-flow cryostat (ICE Oxford, UK) and
an intelligent temperature controller (ITC503, Oxford Instruments,
UK) were used for measurements at cryogenic temperatures (T = 6 K). Data processing was done using Xepr (Bruker BioSpin,
Rheinstetten) and MATLAB 7.11.2 (the MathWorks, Inc., Natick) environment.

2.2 Catalyst Preparation
Zr(OtBu)4 (2.24 g, 5.7 mmol) was mixed with
2.36 mL anhydrous hexanes to prepare a 4.6 mL stock solution (1.2
M) in a 50 mL round-bottom flask in a N2 glovebox. The
Zr(OtBu)4 hexanes solution
was added dropwise onto 4.6 g silica (dried at 200 °C under vacuum
below 5 mTorr) by incipient wetness impregnation. The resulting solid
was dried at room temperature under N2 protection and then
was transferred onto the Schlenk line without exposure to air. The
material was heated to 100 °C for 20 min under flowing nitrogen,
and then the treatment temperature was increased to 200 °C and
maintained at 200 °C under vacuum for 1 h, and then the solid
was cooled down to room temperature. All synthetic operations were
performed under air-free conditions up to this point. After exposure
of the resulting material to air at room temperature, 4.92 g of the
final product 2.6-Zr/SiO2 was obtained. Then, the same
synthesis method was applied to synthesize 1.3-Zr/SiO2 (molar
ratio of ≡SiOH/Zr = 1:0.5) and 0.26-Zr/SiO2 (≡SiOH/Zr
= 1:0.1).

For Co–Zr/SiO2 catalysts, strong
electrostatic adsorption (SEA)56 was applied
as the synthetic method for preparing low and high loading isolated
Co2+ on SiO2 and Zr/SiO2: 2 g of
SiO2 (Davisil 646, 35–60 mesh, 300 m2/g and 1.1 cm3/g, Aldrich) or Zr/SiO2 were
suspended in approximately 20 mL of deionized (DI) water. The pH of
the solution was adjusted to 11 by using concentrated ammonium hydroxide
(28.0–30.0% NH3 basis, Aldrich). In a separate flask,
0.3 g of Co(NH3)6Cl3 was dissolved
in 10 mL of DI water, and the pH was adjusted to 11 with NH4OH. The basic Co3+ solution was rapidly added to the silica
and stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The solid was settled
for 5 min and the solution decanted. The resulting wet powder was
vacuum filtered and rinsed with DI water several times. Then, the
solid was dried in air at 125 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the catalyst
was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h with ramping (5 °C/min).
Total cobalt loading for Co/SiO2 by elemental analysis
were 1.5 wt %. Total cobalt and zirconium loadings for Co–Zr/SiO2 by elemental analysis were 1.5 and 6.0 wt %, respectively.

2.3 X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES)
and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) Measurements
Co K-edge (7709.0 eV) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was measured
in transmission mode conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the
Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-BM) at the
Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Ionization
chambers were optimized for the maximum current with linear response
(ca. 1010 photons detected per second) using 20% He in
N2 (15% absorption) in the incident X-ray detector and
25% Ar in N2 (70% absorption) in the 175 transmission X-ray
detector. The energy was calibrated with a cobalt foil (7709.0 eV).
Third, the X-ray detector was placed in the beam path beyond the transmission
detector to allow acquisition of a reference spectrum concurrent with
each sample measurement. The catalyst was pressed as a 4 mm self-supporting
wafer and placed in a stainless steel holder. The data were collected
for as-prepared, under reaction conditions at 550 °C (3.5% propane
in argon), and cooled down to ambient temperature after reaction but
without exposure to air. Further XAS data analysis and fitting was
processed by using WINXAS 3.2 software. The Co coordination environments
were achieved by fitting of EXAFS data in R-space
to the first nearest neighbor shell after a Fourier transform (k2-weighted).

2.4 Catalytic
Activity Testing
Catalyst
performance testing was conducted in a vertical, quartz tube reactor.
Gas flow was controlled using mass flow controllers, and product distribution
was determined via online gas chromatography (J&W Scientific)
equipped with a 50 m GS-Alumina capillary column and a flame-ionization
detector to which H2 (99.999%, Airgas USA) and air (<2
ppm H2O, Airgas) were also supplied. In a typical run,
approximately 0.5 g of accurately weighed catalyst was supported on
quartz wool with an internal thermocouple placed at the top of the
catalyst bed. Initially, the catalyst was purged with He (99.999%,
Airgas USA) that had been further purified with an oxygen trap at
40 mL/min at room temperature. The temperature was then increased
to the reaction temperature of 550 °C and was allowed to stabilize
for 2 h before introduction of reactant gases. For PDH, the reaction
mixture comprised 3.0% propane in Ar at 20 mL/min.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of Zr/SiO2, Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2
Zirconium-modified
silica was prepared via protonation of Zr(OtBu)4 by silica hydroxyls at room temperature followed
by heating to 200 °C to condense any remaining hydroxyls and
thermally cleave tert-butoxide groups. A similar
synthesis of ZrO2 thin films by atomic layer deposition
(ALD) surface chemistry has been reported by Kukli’s group.57 In our material, we utilized a solution version
of an initial nucleation for an ALD reaction by dosing our precursor
in solution but with the correct volume to fully saturate the SiO2 support mesoporous with Zr(OtBu)4 solution. An equimolar ratio of Zr(OtBu)4 to isolated hydroxyls (≡SiOH/Zr
= 1:1) was used on the basis of the reported OH density after drying
at 200 °C (2.5 OH/nm–2).58 The resulting infrared spectrum and transmission electron
micrographs support the uniformity of Zr sites and lack of large crystals
of ZrOx and are discussed more fully below.
Our approach is also similar to the one used by Wilson et al.31,55 to prepare layers of overcoated zirconia on silica by multiple cycles
of solution treatment of Zr(OiPr)4 in anhydrous organic solvent followed by hydrolysis treatment
with H2O. Single-site cobalt 2+ was then grafted onto the
low-zirconium density Zr/SiO2 via SEA using Co(NH3)6Cl3 concentrated ammonium hydroxide, where
positively charged Co(NH3)63+ form
cation–anion pairs56 with the deprotonated
surface silica hydroxyls to form an orangish material. When it is
heated in air to 300 °C, the Co reduced to Co2+ and
the color of the material upon air exposure is pink.

3.2 Surface Area, Pore Size and Particle Size
The BET surface
area and BJH pore size distribution were acquired
for the bare SiO2, zirconium-modified SiO2 (Zr/SiO2), Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 (plot
shown Figure S1). The surface area of commercial
SiO2 is unchanged by the grafting of Zr to make Zr/SiO2 (324 m2/g vs 323 m2/g). Thus, the Zr(OtBu)4 precursor reacts without
producing pore blockage or pore constriction. However, the grafting
conditions employed for Co addition resulted method resulted in a
loss of surface area of ∼50 and ∼30 m2/g
for Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2, respectively.
This was found to be due to the basic conditions employed during SEA
grafting (pH 11), confirmed by a control experiment that omitted cobalt
from the synthetic protocol. Despite the small reduction of surface
area upon cobalt grafting, the surface areas and pore size distributions
are similar and within 300 ± 30 m2/g (±10%) range.

Conventional TEM (Figure S2) and high-angle
annular dark-field–STEM were also utilized to characterize
the dispersion and configuration of Co and Zr species on the SiO2 support for both as-prepared and post-catalysis Co–Zr/SiO2 samples shown in Figure 1a,b. Highly dispersed Co and Zr are observed on the
SiO2 support with similar Z-contrast and
no aggregation was found post-catalysis, nor carbon nanotubes or other
coke deposits. The STEM–EDX elemental mapping result shown
in Figure 1 shows that
the images of Co, Zr, and Si are completely laid on each other, suggesting
that Co sites could be bonded to the Zr or Si sites. The corresponding
EDX line scan measured along the sample indicates that there is a
relative uniform distribution of Co and Zr atomic sites along with
the SiO2 support.

Figure 1 STEM (top) images of (a) as-prepared and (b)
post-catalysis Co–Zr/SiO2 samples and (bottom) the
corresponding EDS line scan measured
along the as prepared Co–Zr/SiO2.

3.3 DRIFTS and DRUV–Vis
Spectroscopy
Comparison of DRIFTS (Figure 2a) shows that in contrast to Co/SiO2, the
zirconium-modified Zr/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 do not have isolated OH peaks on the surface by the absence of the
peak at 3780 cm–1. A small amount of tert-butanol may have remained coordinated during the synthesis of Zr/SiO2; however, the aqueous cobalt grafting step removes it, as
expected, and no C–H ligands are observed to remain on the
pre-catalysis Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst. DRIFTS (Figure 2b) shows that after
dehydration at 550 °C, the isolated OH peak appears on the Zr/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 surface at 3738 cm–1 which is same as Co/SiO2. No features were resolved that
could be ascribed to Zr–OH features on the as-prepared or materials
dehydrated at 550 °C.

Figure 2 DRIFTS and DRUV–vis spectra of (a) Zr/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Co–Zr/SiO2 in
air, (b) Zr/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Co–Zr/SiO2 dehydration
at 550 °C, and (c) Zr/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and
Co–Zr/SiO2 in air.

Visible inspection of Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 powders post-synthesis shows a striking difference in color,
with the Co/SiO2 displaying a vivid and characteristic
“cobalt blue” while the Co–Zr/SiO2 material has a pinkish hue due to water saturation. More careful
inspection of the materials using DRUV–vis spectroscopy shows
the familiar peaks of the ligand field absorption for isolated tetrahedral
Co(II) of the monometallic Co/SiO2 samples are shown in
red in Figure 2c. The
UV–vis spectrum exhibits three absorption peaks (530, 595,
and 635 nm), which can be explicitly referred to the 4A2(F)/4T1(P) transition of Co(II) ions
in tetrahedral geometry.59,60 The blue shift of the
spectrum is similar to that reported for Co–Zr/SiO2 prepared via a different grafting procedure. Additionally, a sharp
increase in absorption band in the UV region at 200 nm was observed.
This is assigned to a low-energy charge transfer between the oxygen
ligands and central Co(II) ion in tetrahedral symmetry. The Co–Zr/SiO2 spectrum in green in Figure 2c shows significantly higher absorption compared with
Co/SiO2 and a small peak at ∼300 nm. The increase
in intensity is likely attributed to a different geometry of the cobalt
environment (tetrahedral to octahedral) which was further confirmed
by EXAFS analysis (vide infra). In contrast, CoO nanoparticles display
a large, broad peak from 400 to 600 nm,61,62 again consistent
that both of the Co sites are well-dispersed. Zr4+ cannot
be examined due to weak absorption at λ > 200 nm.63,64 The results from DRUV–vis analysis clearly show that the
electronic and chemical structure between the as-prepared Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 are fairly different. However,
the familiar pink of Co(OH2)62+ ions
on the Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst disappears upon heating,
replaced by the characteristic blue of tetrahedral Co2+, which is discussed further below.

EPR is potentially a more
sensitive technique for identifying CoOx clusters than DRIFTS, STEM, or XAS (vide
infra). A selected set of EPR spectra recorded under identical experimental
conditions at 6 K are shown in Figure 3. The EPR signals
of the three samples are essentially identical. The only difference
is in the intensity of the signal, which is due to the concentration
of the Co ions in the sample. The main signal is observed at geff ≈ 5 together with a broad signal
around g ≈ 2. A substantially narrower signal
close to the free electron g-value of 2.0023 was
observed in Co–Zr/SiO2 post-catalysis. This latter
signal is too narrow to be attributed to the cobalt. Most likely this
signal is due to trace amounts of radicals/defects often found in
powders. These impurities may also be the result of Zr reduction under
reaction conditions; however, it is not clear at this time.65 Our materials have a low coverage of Zr on the
silica and absence of large particles of ZrO2 (vide supra),
and isolated Zr3+ sites on silica would not be expected
to be stable to atmospheric oxygen and moisture. Previous studies
have focused on bulk and doped ZrO2 EPR, rather than submonolayer
coverages as in these materials, and we do not have evidence for reduction
of Zr in our materials. Our analysis of the possible cobalt EPR-active
species is as follows: we have confirmed that the cobalt in our samples
is Co(II) via XAS analysis and Co(III) complexes should be EPR-silent
under our experimental conditions. While Co(IV) has a low-spin state S = 1/2 and gives distinct EPR spectra around g ≈ 2, this type of signals was not observed in our experiment.66 On the basis of the findings by Britt and co-workers,66 the EPR signals observed here belong to Co(II)
high spin state (S = 3/2), probably in tetrahedral
symmetry or axially distorted tetrahedral symmetry,67 very similar to our previously reported Co/SiO2 catalysts.21 Four-coordinated square
planar Co(II) complexes as well as square planar Co(II) complexes
with one or two axial ligands usually demonstrate low-spin state (S = 1/2) and give EPR signals different from those observed
here.68−20070 However, as
an alternative explanation, according to Peters and co-workers,67 it could also be a dimer or multimer of Co(II);
as stated by Britt and co-workers:66 “The
feature at geff ≈ 5 is reminiscent
of EPR spectra measured for many Co(II)-containing compounds, including
Co3O4, Co3(PO4)2.” However, no appreciable amounts of Co(III) were detected
via XAS, as would be necessary for Co3O4 or
cobalt phosphate in these materials. Thus EPR was able to demonstrate
the absence of CoO but not other potential clusters with different
oxidation states. However, bulk XAS analysis was able to exclude the
presence of substantial amounts of Co3+ and thus the presence
of Co3O4 clusters, too.

at 6 K.

3.4 XANES
and EXAFS
In situ XANES and
EXAFS spectra of Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 samples for three different conditions were collected: (1) as-prepared,
(2) in situ during dehydrogenation of propane at 550 °C, and
(3) post-catalysis at room temperature without exposure to air. Figure 4 shows the XANES
spectra of the samples collected under these conditions. The pre-edge
energy of Co in all six cases including both Co/SiO2 and
Co–Zr/SiO2 were found to be 7.7092 keV which is
consistent with the reported Co2+ reference compounds.
This evidently indicates that the oxidation state of cobalt of Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst remains as +2 during
PDH at 550 °C. Consistent with this observation, no consumption
of hydrogen was detected from RT to 600 °C during a TPR experiment.

XANES spectra of (a) Co/SiO2 and (b) Co–Zr/SiO2 samples (1) as-prepared, (2) dehydrogenation reaction condition
at 550 °C, and (3) cooled down to RT after catalysis.

Though the cobalt oxidation of state does not change
upon heating, the coordination number does change for Co–Zr/SiO2 upon heating, consistent with the color changes and other
previously discussed observations. Figure 5 compares the Co K-edge EXAFS spectra between
Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2. The first shell
peak intensity decreased upon heating as-prepared Co–Zr/SiO2 and fitting of the first shell Co–O peak in EXAFS
spectra resulted in coordination number of 6 for as-prepared Co–Zr/SiO2 that decreases to less than 4 on average upon heating (Table 1).

Heating Co–Zr/SiO2 dissociates water with increasing
temperate and under reaction conditions (550 °C), the coordination
number cobalt drops down to 4.1. Notably, no change in average coordination
number was observed for Co/SiO2. Addition of water on the
post-reaction catalyst at RT changes the color of Co–Zr/SiO2 sample back to pink (octahedral) within about half an hour,
showing that the cobalt surface hydration is reversible and that Co
sites remain isolated after PDH catalysis.

The fitted Co–O
bond distances are different but not significantly
so. The Co–O distances in Co–Zr/SiO2 (as-prepared
= 2.05 ± 0.01 Å, post-reaction = 1.99 ± 0.02 Å)
was found to be slightly longer than that of Co/SiO2 (as-prepared
= 1.98 ± 0.01 Å, post-reaction = 1.97 ± 0.02 Å).
However, these distances are notably longer than the reported Co–O
bond of Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on SiO2 reduced at 553 K of 1.91 Å.71 Thus, while the average Co–O bond distances when supported
on SiO2 and Zr/SiO2 are not significantly different,
the fact that the cobalt of Co–Zr/SiO2 is hydrated/dehydrated
readily is also consistent with a weaker cobalt–support interaction
than Co/SiO2, which does not hydrate, and is consistent
with the red shift in the UV–vis spectrum of Co–Zr/SiO2.

3.5 Catalytic PDH
The catalytic activity
of Co–Zr/SiO2 and Co/SiO2 were compared
under similar reaction conditions (at 550 °C, propane flow rate
is 20 mL/min), with conversion levels controlled to below 10% in remain
in the kinetically-controlled regime. The turnover frequency (TOF)
value obtained over Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst was found
to be 10.0 h–1 (±10%) at 550 °C, which
is three times faster than that of Co/SiO2. A control experiment
under the same reaction conditions using the bare Zr/SiO2 support shows negligible catalytic activity for PDH and thus there
is no contribution from Zr/SiO2 to the catalytic activity
of the Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst. This is in contrast
to reports of ZrO2 and doped MZrO2 (M = La etc.)
materials, where coordinatively unsaturated ZCUS are proposed as active participants.32 We do not have evidence that single-site zirconium on silica
has similar catalytic behavior under these conditions. Also of note,
O2– ion mobility varies widely with doping levels
in doped MOx materials.72−74 In addition
to having a higher PDH rate than Co/SiO2, Co–Zr/SiO2 also shows higher propene selectivity at 550 °C of ∼97%
versus the Co/SiO2 catalyst of 93%. It should be noted
that in most heterogeneous catalyst systems, the selectivity decreases
as the conversion increases. However, in this case, both selectivity and rate for Co–Zr/SiO2 are higher than
the zirconium-free catalyst. The catalysts are stable on-stream for
at least 20 h and negligible coke formation (>99% carbon balance
during
the run). Finally, the reversible hydration of the cobalt led us to
test whether long-term storage under ambient conditions would lead
to different catalyst behavior. We found that after storage in air
for 1 month, samples of Co–Zr/SiO2 catalysts have
no detectible change in catalytic behavior when tested. These results,
together with the STEM images of the post-catalysis Co–Zr/SiO2 catalysts (Figure 1) provide clear evidence that no nanoparticles are forming
under reaction conditions, in contrast to cobalt on silica catalysts
reported by Coperet.22

The different
cobalt hydration behavior and catalytic function were obtained for
Co–Zr/SiO2 containing excess zirconium sites with
ratio of zirconium to cobalt of ca. 2.6:1; however, we lowered the
ratio of Zr to Co for two reasons: (1) to see if there was a preference
for cobalt to reside near a zirconium site on the surface of the silica
and (2) to see if there is differing activity with lower density of
zirconia. Thus, we found that at a 1:1.3 ratio of Co and Zr the PDH
rate and selectivity were unchanged from Co–Zr/SiO2 (2.6:1 ratio) within error. Further lowering of the amount of zirconium
to substoichiometric 1:0.26 resulted in an observed PDH rate that
is approximately the weighted average of the Co/SiO2 and
Co–Zr/SiO2 rates, also consistent with cobalt sites
being directly promoted by the Zr (Figure 6). The selectivity of the PDH was found to
be ca. 97% for all Co–Zr/SiO2 species (Figure 7). It is reasonable
to expect that a labile octahedral Co2+ ion would be able
to traverse the surface prior to dehydration based upon our previous
observation of the dispersal of CoO clusters, so we infer that these
results to show some thermodynamic preference for Co–O–Zr≡
linkages, though further study is clearly needed and in progress.

(3% in Ar) flow rate is 20 mL/min, using Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 with increasing Zr loading (numbers indicate molar ratio
of Co to Zr).

performed at 550 °C, propane
(3% in Ar) flow rate is 20 mL/min, using Co/SiO2 and Co–Zr/SiO2 with increasing Zr loading (numbers indicate molar ratio
of Co to Zr).

Our proposed structures
for the distribution of cobalt sites in
the varying Co–Zr/SiO2 catalysts are summarized
in Figure 8. The surface
Co2+ comprises two types of sites, Co atoms adjacent to
the ≡Zr–OH and Co sites that are not adjacent to the
≡Zr–OH (neglecting siloxane ring size effects). When
excess or stoichiometric zirconium sites are present, octahedral cobalt
2+ ions are preferentially associated with them. They are hydrolytically
labile and hydrate under air but dehydrate to tetrahedral Co2+ under reaction conditions. Because of the highly dispersed zirconium,
it is also possible to assume that Zr might deposit randomly on the
catalyst surface. However, in this case, the substoichiometric zirconium
loadings would not be expected to be populated by adjacent cobalt
sites as a weighted average, as inferred from the TOF of the working
catalysts. Furthermore, the observed weighted average TOF is also
not consistent with more than one cobalt associating with a zirconium
site. Thus, we hypothesize that this system has a thermodynamic preference
for a cobalt to be adjacent to a surface zirconium, if one exists,
and that these sites are both faster for PDH as well as more selective.

materials and Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst site distribution.
The Co–X lines (SiO2 or Zr) represent Co–O–X
bonds.

In addition to the location of
Co relative to Zr on the SiO2 surface, some discussion
of the electronic impact of the
electrophilic Zr is needed. Our Co–Zr/SiO2 catalyst
shows similar UV–vis shifts as previous work by Macnaughtan,
Soo, and Frei60 due to electron-withdrawing
Zr decreasing the π donation of O ligand into transition-metal
Co and a widening of the d-orbital splitting. This lowers the Co–O
bond strength and results in a larger splitting energy between e and
t2 orbitals of Co–Zr/SiO2 than Co/SiO2 (Figure 9).
Altering the π-donating ability of a ligand, a common strategy
for tuning rate and selectivity in homogeneous catalysis, is less
understood for single-site ionic catalysts such as these. The increase
in rate due to the electron-withdrawing effects of Zr is consistent
with our previous calculations,40 that
shows that decreasing the catalyst–oxygen bond strength leads
to an increase in PDH rate. Although the impact on PDH rate in this
specific case was a modest increase, the increase in catalytic selectivity
to propene (ca. 92–97%) was significant. This observation shows
that relatively small perturbations in catalyst–support bond
strengths can result in significant changes in not only C–H
heterolytic cleavage, the rate-determining step of dehydrogenation
but also the catalytic selectivity of the reaction. The origin of
the change in selectivity is not understood at this time and is the
subject of ongoing work.

4 Conclusion
Higher turnover frequencies were observed for the Zr-promoted cobalt
catalysts with significant increase in propane conversion and propene
selectivity compared with the Co/SiO2 catalyst. The relationship
between Zr loading and catalyst selectivity is consistent with the
formation of enhanced active sites at the interface between the Co
metal and the Zr promoter atom. As Zr loading increases, the active
sites adjacent to the promoter increases. Ultimately, the fraction
of active sites that are promoted approaches unity, suggesting that
this occurs near a Zr/Co atomic ratio of 1, and no further improvements
to the product selectivity result from higher Zr loading. This suggests
the Lewis acidity of the promoter is the relevant descriptor for metal
oxide promotion effects. The improved dehydrogenation activity was
attributed to the ease of heterolytic cleavage of the C–H bond
over a weaker Co–O bond of ≡Zr–O–Co. The
positive effects of having weaker M–O bond for facial heterolytic
cleavage leads to a promising strategy for rational catalyst design.
