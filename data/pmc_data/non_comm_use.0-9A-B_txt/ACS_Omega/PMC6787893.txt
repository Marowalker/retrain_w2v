During the processes associated with
glass corrosion, porous hydrated glass alteration layers typically
form upon exposure to aqueous conditions for extended time periods.
The impacts of the alteration layer on glass durability have not been
agreed upon in the glass science community. In particular, the formation
mechanisms of hydrated glass alteration layers are still largely unknown
and require further investigation, but these layers often require
months to years to develop and are often too thin to adequately characterize.
Meanwhile, sol–gel-derived silicate gels are relatively easy
to synthesize in bulk with custom compositions relevant to hydrated
glass alteration layers. If alteration layers and synthetic silicate
gels demonstrate physical and chemical properties that are sufficiently
similar, synthetic silicate gels could be used as analogues for hydrated
glass alteration layers in future studies. However, synthetic gels
must first be prepared and evaluated before comparisons between glass
alteration layers and synthetic silicate gels can be made. This work
focuses entirely on the synthesis and observed physical properties
of synthetic silicate gels. A future work will compare the characteristics
of synthetic gels described in this work with altered waste glass
formed in similar pH environments. In this study, synthetic gels were
made with custom compositions at various pH values to evaluate the
effect of pH on gel structure and morphology. Several other variables
were examined also, such as composition, drying, and aging. Gels were
produced by sequential additions of organometallic precursors in a
single container. Gels were analyzed with several techniques including
small-angle X-ray scattering, gas adsorption, and He pycnometry to
determine the effects of the variables on physical properties. Results
show that gels prepared at pH 3 consistently contained fewer primary
particles with diameters larger than 7.2 nm and fewer pores with diameters
larger than 30 nm compared to gels synthesized at pH 7 and 9. Composition
was shown to have no discernable effect on primary particle and pore
sizes at any pH.

1 Introduction
The
durability of glasses is vital to several fields including medicine,
optics, and nuclear waste disposal and needs to be understood for
the glasses to be reliable in their respective fields.1−5 Before the glass durability lifetime can be determined for a given
glass, glass alteration behavior must be adequately understood.4,6,7 Prior research into the durability
of these materials, and the mechanisms that control it, has shown
that porous hydrated alteration gel layers typically form at the surface
of glass upon exposure to static aqueous conditions for extended time
periods.7−16 Although the properties of the alteration gel layers have been investigated,
the mechanisms behind their formation and their role in glass alteration
mechanisms are not well understood and require more data from the
community to optimize predictive models.8,11,15−17 Formation of glass alteration
layers often requires long-term experiments (months to years), and
the resulting alteration gel layer is often too thin for adequate
characterization.

Hydrated alteration gel layers are typically
more porous than the original glass, but their porosities are often
dependent on several variables including glass composition and solution
pH.17−20 Alteration gel layers are composed mostly of silica but can also
contain varying amounts of other elements such as Al, Ca, Na, and
Zr. Alteration gel layers have proven to be challenging to characterize,
mainly because they are thin, difficult to isolate, and occasionally
nonuniform.8,16,21,22 Silicate gels synthesized via the sol–gel
method, however, are relatively straightforward to synthesize in bulk
and thus are much more straightforward to characterize. Because of
this, formation mechanisms under various conditions are relatively
well understood for simple silica gels synthesized via the sol–gel
method.23−29 While comparisons of similar composition gels have not yet been
done, the similarities in basic properties such as composition range,
specific surface area, and amorphous nature suggest that parallels
could be drawn between the formation and evolution of the two systems.8,20,24,27,28 If the formation mechanisms of complicated,
multicomponent gels could be better understood as well as the formation
mechanisms of simple silica gels, the knowledge gained could potentially
be applied to studying the formation of alteration gel layers in corroded
glasses.

International Simple Glass (ISG), a six oxide borosilicate
glass developed as a reference glass for studying nuclear waste glass
alteration mechanisms as part of an international collaboration, was
chosen as the starting glass composition for the current study due
to its simplicity and relevance.4 Previously,
alteration layers of ISG altered in aqueous conditions of varying
pH have been produced.21 The constituent
ratios of the composition of these alteration layers of altered ISG
were chosen as target compositions for synthetic gels. However, the
interpretation of data obtained from sol–gel materials synthesized
based on the compositions of the alteration layers of ISG may present
some difficulties due to the large number of components. Simplified
versions of ISG have been prepared and altered in aqueous conditions
by Gin et al.30 Two of these glasses, termed
CJ2 and CJ3, have identical elemental molar ratios to ISG, but CJ3
excludes Zr and CJ2 excludes Zr and Ca from their respective compositions
as presented with Table 1. Preparation of synthetic gels with compositions equivalent with
the alteration layers of ISG, CJ2, and CJ3 will lead to a better understanding
of the effects of adding Ca and Zr to the compositions on the gel
structure and properties.

2 Background
Silica gels can be prepared from the sol–gel
polymerization of silicon alkoxides such as tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS or Si(OC2H5)4), as seen in
the procedure outlined in the literature.24,25,31,32 When TEOS
and water are mixed in a mutual solvent (usually ethanol), hydrolysis
occurs to create silanols23−25  

However, complete hydrolysis does not occur if the amount
of water is limited as shown above. Rather condensation occurs between
either two silanols or a silanol and an ethoxy group to form a bridging
oxygen or a siloxane group, that is, Si–O–Si. A water
or ethanol molecule is then eliminated as seen in the following reaction  

The
hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions occur throughout the solution
to form colloidal particles (sol), which form into a gel with time.

When additional cations are incorporated into a sol, the hydrolysis
and condensation reactions have different kinetics requiring organometallic
precursors to be added sequentially to the reaction mixture to avoid
coprecipitation.24,33−36 An in-depth literature search
was conducted for sol–gel processes with similar compositions
to the current study to determine the optimal order of precursors
for making a gel with a composition identical to alteration layers
of borosilicate glasses, particularly glasses relevant to nuclear
waste disposal. Unfortunately, nothing could be found containing all
the components of an alteration layer of ISG (i.e., Si, Al, Na, Ca,
and Zr). However, guidelines for the synthesis of simpler gels were
found. For instance, in sol–gel syntheses used in Irwin et
al. and Riley et al., the Si precursor was added to the reaction mixture
first followed by Al and then Na precursors.33,37 In the bioglass community, glasses are made with Ca where the synthesis
involves the addition of a Ca precursor to the reaction mixture before
a Na precursor.38,39 For previous works where Zr was
added to reactions also containing Si and Na, it was not indicated
when Zr was added.40,41 However, as long as Zr is added
after Si, the small amount of added Zr should incorporate itself easily
(and not coprecipitate) into the silica matrix since both Si and Zr
are tetravalent.42

Several variables
are important to consider for sol–gel synthesis such as aging
times, composition, pH, and drying. Solution pH is among the most
important variables in terms of the impact to pore and particle sizes.23,24,26,27 Under acid-catalyzed conditions, silica gels tend to consist of
linear chains that entangle and form additional branches, resulting
in gelation, whereas under basic conditions, more highly branched
clusters form and link to create the gel network.23−25,32,43,44 Because of these differences, gels synthesized under acidic conditions
are typically composed of smaller particles and smaller pore diameters
compared to gels prepared under basic conditions.

3 Experimental Procedure
3.1 Sol–Gel Synthesis
Sol–gel-derived gels were synthesized using compositions
comparable to those of alteration layers produced from the static
corrosion of glasses CJ2 and CJ3 from Gin et al.30 and ISG from Kaspar et al.21 as shown in Table 2. Since elemental molar ratios of Si, Al, and Na are identical in
the CJ2, CJ3, and ISG original glass compositions (Table 1), synthetic gels based on altered
CJ2, CJ3, and ISG have similar compositions.30 Additionally, each composition was made at target pH values of 3,
7, and 9.

The
general stepwise synthesis is presented with Figure 1. TEOS (Aldrich), deionized water (H2O), and ethanol (EtOH, 100%, Decon Labs, Inc.) were initially
mixed in a mole ratio of 1:4:8 into 60 mL Savillex vials. Mixing times
were targeted to be 5–8 h to ensure the components had time
to react properly but were increased as needed.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of synthesis steps for sol–gel batches (specific details for
individual batches for steps a–i are explained in Table 3).

After adding TEOS, the pH of the mixture was adjusted with
0.1 M HNO3 at pH 3, a mixture of 2.7 M NH4OH
and 0.4 M NH4F (NH4OH/NH4F) at pH
7,45 and concentrated NH4OH
or NH4OH/NH4F at pH 9. The pH values were determined
using pH strips (Hydrion). After mixing, aluminum-tri-sec-butoxide
(Al(OBus)3) (Aldrich), zirconium(IV) propoxide (Zr(IV)
prop) (Acros Organics), and more EtOH were added to the mixture. The
pH values for all the mixtures dropped significantly (pH 1.5–2)
for batches measured after Al(OBus)3, Zr(IV) prop, and
EtOH were added and mixed. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) (Sigma-Aldrich)
and calcium 2-methoxyethoxide (CaMeEt) (Gelest, Inc.) followed, causing
the pH to increase (pH 8–11). Aliquots of 0.1 M HNO3 were added to ISG mixtures at originally pH 3 and 7 instead of H2O to try to lower pH, but no change in pH occurred (as observed
by pH strips).

Following the addition of H2O or 0.1
M HNO3 to the sol–gel mixtures and final mixing,
the batches were cast into multiple smaller capped polypropylene vials
and set aside for gelation, as shown in Figure 1. After gelation, samples were aged for various
time periods. Because of the assortment of experimental conditions,
various times were utilized for aging. This resulted in dozens of
samples being made since each batch was divided into five samples
to age for various durations. After the samples had completed the
aging process, they were placed in 50/50 mixtures of EtOH and H2O (EtOH/H2O) to fully hydrolyze any remaining unhydrolyzed
organometallic precursors. EtOH/H2O solvents were exchanged
daily until pH strips indicated that the pH was identical to pure
EtOH/H2O, which has a pH of roughly 6.5. Following EtOH/H2O exchanges, the samples were placed in 100% EtOH and exchanged
daily with fresh EtOH to remove residue waters. After five or more
exchanges, the samples were either left immersed in EtOH as alcogels
or supercritically dried (SCD) with CO2 to prevent gel
structure collapse into aerogels.46

Batches are denoted as their composition of the altered glass they
are based on followed by their target pH and chorological identification
in alphabetical order. Thus, the first batch made with the CJ2 composition
at target pH 9 is referred to as CJ2.9.A. Samples are referred to
as the batch name followed by their aging time in days, as indicated
in Figure 1 and Table 3. For example, a sample aged for 15 days from batch CJ2.9.A
is referred to as CJ2.9.A-15. Finally, samples immersed in EtOH feature
a superscripted “E” at the end of the name, whereas
SCD samples have no superscript. For example, CJ2.3.B-45E is immersed in EtOH, and CJ2.3.B-45 has been SCD.

3.2 ICP-OES
Measurements
Portions of CJ2.9.A-7, CJ2.9.A-15, CJ3.7.A-17,
ISG.3.B-7, ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-47, and ISG.9.B-45 were mixed with
KOH and melted at 600 °C. The resulting potassium silicate was
dissolved in deionized water at 90 °C and acidified to determine
the composition of the samples. Aliquots of these solutions were diluted
with 0.1 to 0.3 M HNO3 and analyzed for Al, Ca, K, Na,
Si, and Zr concentrations using PerkinElmer Optima 8300 dual-view
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)
with an Elemental Scientific SC4 DX FAST auto-sampler interface. The
instrument was calibrated using standards made by the High-Purity
Standards Corporation to generate calibration plots ranging from 50
ppb to 50 ppm. This calibration was verified immediately with initial
calibration verification and during sample analysis with a continuous
calibration verification run every 10 samples at a minimum as per
Hanford Analytical Quality Assurance Requirements Document requirements.47 Calibration blanks were also analyzed after
each calibration verification to ensure that background signals and
potential carryover effects were not a factor. The calibration was
independently verified using standards made by Inorganic Ventures.
Mass fractions were calculated using ICP-OES concentrations, known
initial masses, and dilution volumes.

3.3 Density
Measurements via Pycnometry
Skeletal densities of SCD gels
were measured using helium pycnometry on a Micromeritics AccuPyc II
1340 Gas Pycnometer. Ten density measurements were performed and averaged,
providing a confidence error interval greater than 99%. Masses were
measured on an analytical balance, and then densities were calculated
from these values along with a standard deviation.

3.4 SAXS Measurements
Synthetic gels were analyzed using
ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) and small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) experiments conducted on beamline 9-ID, station C, at the Advanced
Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA). The
setup is described elsewhere.48,49 Beamline 9-ID-C is
equipped with an advanced-design Bonse–Hart camera for USAXS
analysis integrated with fixed-length pinhole SAXS (500 mm) cameras.50 The camera is capable of recording SAXS profiles
with an angular resolution of ∼8 × 10–5 Å–1 in q (scattering vector)
ranging from 10–4 to 1.2 Å–1. The scattering vector q (Å–1) is defined in eq 1 and is typically used in small-angle scattering communities to relate
to the diffraction angle (2θ) 1  where λ is wavelength in Å.
Using Bragg’s law, the scattering distance d can be determined from q using eq 2 as follows 2  

Incident photons with energy of 21 keV with
a corresponding wavelength of 0.5904 Å were used in this study.
The USAXS instrument runs a slit-smeared Bonse–Hart setup,
and in this experiment, the slit length was 0.027843 Å–1. Slit smearing is included in data analysis models. Three separate
analysis locations were analyzed per sample for 5 min each. USAXS
and SAXS data were completely corrected for instrumental variations,
reduced, and analyzed with Igor Pro (v.7.0.5.2) from WaveMetrics,
Inc. (Oswego, OR, USA), coupled with Nika (v.1.74) and Irena (v.2.61)
packages.51,52

Data obtained from SAXS represent
scattering from the minority phase of a sample or a mixture of scattering
from both phases when the phases are in comparable quantities, as
defined by Babinet’s principle. SAXS is unable to identify
a single phase. Pore fractions are taken as guidelines for what is
likely being analyzed, but the true pore fractions at a particular
scattering distance remain unknown. Typically, SAXS profiles of samples
with pore fractions greater than ∼80% and less than ∼20%
are considered to represent exclusively the minority phases, whereas
SAXS profiles of samples with all other pore fractions are considered
mix. Due to pore fraction analysis by nitrogen gas adsorption techniques
on multiple aerogels (see Sections 3.5 and 4.1), the SAXS measurements are considered to represent the skeletal
phase for each sol–gel synthesized sample.

Many samples
were analyzed with the unified method developed by Beaucage and Schafer.53,54 The unified method models the SAXS distribution intensity I as a hierarchical structure where the small structures
build into larger structures. The unified equation for a hierarchical
structure with multiple levels is given as follows53 3  where n is the structure levels, Rgi is the radius of gyration of the ith level, Pi is the power-law exponent, Gi is the Guinier prefactor, and Bi is the prefactor specific to the type of power-law scattering fails.
All samples were analyzed using the unified method using one to three
structural levels where structure level one begins at the highest q region. From this model, Rg characterizes the size of the scattered material regardless of shape.55 However, Rg relates
to the dimension of the scattered material differently, depending
on the shape of the particle.

The shape of the scattering material
is unknown, and Rg values are presented
rather than r values of a predetermined shape. For
this study, the Rg value was the most
important parameter evaluated from the unified equation. The other
values of the other parameters (P, G, and B) can be found in the Supporting Information.

SAXSMorph56 was used to generate three-dimensional representations
(cubes) of structures for the samples featured in Figure 4 using known pore fractions
and SAXS profiles (see Section 4.4.1). Because the infinite number of structures provides
the same SAXS profile, representations produced through SAXSMorph
are potential microstructures and are not guaranteed to match the
real structure. The structures created are random examples that fit
the SAXS data that present structures similar to the real structure.
Dimensions of the constructed cubes were defined to be 1000 Å
(100 nm) to see small feature changes; input minimum and maximum q values were 0.0005–1.0 Å–1 for each sample. Minimum and maximum q values were
chosen to include all relevant features seen on SAXS plots. All other
input parameters were left in their default settings. Output files
consisted of coordinates for three-dimensional (3D) representations
and two-dimensional (2D) cross sections of the 3D representations.
Persistence of Vision (POV) free software is used to visualize the
representations.57 The samples selected
for this analysis fit all of the requirements required for the software
as the samples are isotropic, nonperiodic two-phase systems and the q range of the data approaches q–4 at high q.56

3.5 Nitrogen Gas Adsorption Measurements
Nitrogen gas (at
77 K) desorption isotherms of SCD gels were determined using a Micromeritics
ASAP 202 Surface Area Analyzer. Pore size distributions (PSD) were
determined using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method for
nitrogen on desorption data.

The data obtained from BJH was
similar to the SAXS data in that the data are obtained as differential
pore volumes (d(Vp/m)/dD) in cm3·g–1·Å–1 presented as a function of diameter in Å to
account for various bin sizes in log scale. Errors of 10% are given
to account for instrumental variations based on multiple analyzes
on a silica-alumina standard (Micromeritics).

Additionally,
the BJH method determined total pore volumes per sample mass (Vp/m in cm3·g–1), which can be used to calculate pore fraction (Φ) 4  where Vs is the
skeletal volume in cm3, and ρs is the skeletal density in g·cm–3.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Synthesis
Observations and Physical Descriptions of Successful Gels
Table 3 describes
synthesis details including reactant volumes, mixing times, and pH
values for each successful batch that corresponds to the steps a–i
in Figure 1. The goal
of the synthesis was to produce viable gels, knowing that multiple
additions of various precursor materials could lead to difficulties
in maintaining a consistent synthesis method for each pH condition.
Many batches failed to gel using initial synthesis conditions, requiring
variables such as mixing times and catalyst addition placement to
be adjusted. Mixing times were initially targeted to be 5–8
h, but longer mixing durations were required for most batches for
at least some of the synthesis steps to form a gel, especially after
the addition of Al(OBus)3 in step b.

Because the
gels produced in this study are composed of several oxides, catalyst
addition placement (whether the catalyst added near the beginning
or end) seemed to heavily influence whether a batch would form a gel.
Gels at pH 3 were only formed when the catalyst was added after the
TEOS addition (step a), and gels at pH 9 formed when NH4OH/NH4F was used as a catalyst after all components were
added to the batch (step f). Gels at pH 7 were made when the catalyst
was added after TEOS (step a) for CJ3 and ISG gels and, at the end
(step f), for CJ2. No ISG gels were created using a catalyst at the
end of the experiment.

Throughout the synthesis of the various
batches, the measured pH fluctuated from the target pH as more components
were added. Attempts were made to control the pH in many batches,
especially batches prepared at pH 3, but numerous batches failed due
to the formation of precipitates. Only batch CJ2.3.B (which includes
samples CJ2.3.B-7 and CJ2.3.B-15) produced a gel after pH was adjusted
to its target pH at the end of the synthesis (step f in Table 3) where the gel was yellow-white
in color and more mechanically robust than the other gels once SCD. Table 4 lists physical descriptions
of color, opacity, and texture for SCD gels, which shows that most
samples appeared white and opaque and had textures that were either
stiff and brittle or soft and fragile (similar to chalk). Other batches
adjusted at the end did not produce a gel but produced precipitates.
CJ2.3.B-7 and CJ2.3.B-15 may include precipitates within the gel or
may be precipitates themselves and were not compared with the other
samples. All other batches, especially those made at pH 3, were not
adjusted at the end of the synthesis to avoid precipitates.

Selected synthetic gel compositions determined
by digestion followed by solution analysis are shown in Table 2 for CJ2.9.A-7, CJ2.9.A-15,
CJ3.7.A-17, ISG.3.B-7, ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-47, and ISG.9.B-45. The
compositions of the specimens indicate that there was more sodium
and less silicon than expected, regardless of the experimental conditions,
that is, solution pH and composition. The TEOS may not have fully
incorporated into the gel during synthesis, and some residual silicon
could have been removed during the washing steps. Although not tested,
stirring batches are longer in step a, while increasing reaction heat
may improve silicon retention as most of the silicon network is made
during step a. Future works could verify this hypothesis to allow
for complete TEOS incorporation.

samples were similar to or slightly higher than the density of amorphous
silica (2.2 g·cm–3),58 with the exception of ISG.3.B-15, which had a density of 1.86 ±
0.02 g·cm–3. Skeletal density values (especially
ISG.3.B-15) could be lower than actual values due to closed porosities,
which were unable to be analyzed with He pycnometry.

4.2 Structural Comparisons of Alcogels and Aerogels
Gel
structures of alcogels (samples immersed in EtOH, designated by superscript
E following their names) were compared with aerogels from the same
sample to compare gel structures. In Figure 2a–e, SAXS profiles are shown for CJ2.3.E-61E and CJ2.3.E-61, CJ2.7.B-15E and CJ2.7.B-15, CJ3.3.B-15E and CJ2.7.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17E and CJ3.7.A-17, ISG.3.B-15E and ISG.B.A-15, and ISG.9.B-45E and ISG.9.B-45,
respectively, where the alcogels are indicated in red, and aerogels
are indicated in blue. For q values greater than
0.2 Å–1 in Figure 2a–f, the intensities of the alcogels
deviate from the intensities of their corresponding aerogel. This
observation is consistent with previous studies such as those by Perissinotto
et al. and Vollet et al., which concluded electronic density fluctuations
caused by imperfect solvent exchange at the molecular level could
be an explanation for the change in the slope for the SCD samples.59,60

and ISG.9.B-45E. All alcogel samples (denoted by superscript
E at the end of the sample name) are indicated by red lines, and aerogel
samples are indicated by blue lines.

4.3 Influence of Sample Aging on the Aerogel Structure
Gel structures of samples from the same batch aged for different
durations were analyzed with SAXS to examine aging effects on the
pore structure. CJ2.9 was chosen for analysis because CJ2 is the simplest
composition and pH 9 samples were the most straightforward samples
to synthesize. Figure 3 shows the SAXS profiles for CJ2.9.A-3, CJ2.9.A-7, CJ2.9.A-15, and
CJ2.9.A-30, with important Rg locations
indicated. Table 6 shows
the Rg values fitted for Figure 3. All samples in this series
exhibit similar scattering behavior with minor variations in Rg parameters for most of the q range. In the highest q region of Figure 3 (q > 1
Å–1), atomic structural features associated
with amorphous silica become less defined as aging time increases.
Although the large structural components (q <
1 Å–1) of the samples remain relatively unchanged
as time changes, the structures on the atomic level are becoming more
amorphous. Previous studies have shown that condensation reactions
continue long after gelation in silica gels due to the large concentration
of hydroxyl groups in a process known as polymerization.24,61−63 Variations between samples observed in Figure 3 are likely due to polymerization
of labile hydroxyl groups within the gel structure, although the large
components of the structure remain unchanged.

4.4 Influences of Elemental
Composition and pH
To investigate composition and pH effects
on gel and pore structures, aerogels featured in Table 5 were examined with SAXS and
gas absorption analyses since each composition and pH combination
are represented. The samples investigated consist of CJ2.3.E-61, CJ2.7.B-15,
CJ2.9.B-15, CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17, CJ3.9.A-15, ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60,
and ISG.9.B-45. Although the samples were aged for various times,
aging was shown to have little to no impact (Section 4.3).

4.4.1 Gel Structure Investigations
Using SAXS Analysis
Figure 4a–c shows the SAXS profiles
for compositions CJ2 (CJ2.3.E-61, CJ2.7.E-15, and CJ2.9.B-15), CJ3
(CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17, and CJ3.9.A-15), and ISG (ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60,
and ISG.9.B-45), respectively, and locations of Rg knees. Table 6 shows the Rg values associated with
the samples in Figure 4. The SAXS profiles of all the samples exhibit similar scattering
behavior in the high q regions (approximately q > 0.1 Å–1), showing faint Rg1 knees, which may represent
small dimer or trimer species as their Rg1 values are within the range of 5–30 Å,
which are incorporated in larger primary particles. However, the SAXS
profiles of the samples vary in the mid q region
(approximately 0.1 Å–1 > q > 0.001 Å–1) and the low q region (approximately q < 0.0001 Å–1).

Figure 4 SAXS profile for various samples of compositions (a) CJ2
(CJ2.3.E-61, CJ2.7.E-15, and CJ2.9.B-15), (b) CJ3 (CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17,
and CJ3.9.A-15), and (c) ISG (ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60, and ISG.9.B-45).
Locations of Rg values are indicated,
and the Rg values are given in Table 6.

4.4.1.1 pH Effects for CJ2 Aerogels
In Figure 4a, SAXS profiles of CJ2.3.E-61 and CJ2.7.B-15
each have distinct Rg2 knees in the mid q range, which represent primary
particles whose sizes are indicated in Table 6. In the lower q region
adjacent to the Rg2 curve,
the CJ2.7.B-15 profile shows stagnation in intensity (which is evidenced
by a “shelf” in the profile) before the intensity increases,
indicating that the Rg2 curve represents a distinct maximum primary particle size and the
increase in intensity in the q < 0.001 Å–1 range represents scattering of multiple primary particles
analyzed at larger scattering distances.

The intensity stagnation
shelf following the Rg2 curve of CJ2.3.E-61 is smaller as the intensity increases at a higher q than in the CJ2.7.B-15 SAXS profile. Another Rg curve (Rg3) for CJ2.3.E-61 is present, although no visible intensity
stagnation shelf is present as intensity continues to increase as q decreases. This implies that Rg2 represents a major primary particle size and Rg3 could either represent a
larger primary particle size or scattering of multiple smaller primary
particles. Because the intensity stagnation shelf between the Rg2 and Rg3 knees is so small, determining which option
is more likely is difficult.

The fitting of the Rg2 curve on the CJ2.9.B-30 profile has
high uncertainty (as seen in Table 6) and shows no intensity stagnation shelf. Because
the Rg2 value is so large,
it likely represents the scattering of multiple primary particles
rather than a single particle. Since there are no Rg knees detected before Rg2, the primary particles in CJ2.9.B-30 appear to have a distinct
maximum size as in CJ2.7.B-15 but vary greatly in sizes across several
decades of q.

Out of the samples analyzed in Figure 4a, only CJ2.7.B-15
showed one definitive maximum primary particle size (defined by the Rg2 curve). While CJ2.3.E-61
showed a major primary particle size (also defined by the Rg2 curve), the Rg3 curve brings forward questions about
whether a larger primary particle size exists in CJ2.3.E-61. If the Rg3 curve of the CJ2.3.E-61
represents scattering of multiple smaller primary particles, then
the Rg2 curve could represent
the maximum primary particle size. If that is the case, then the maximum
particle size of CJ2.7.B-15 would be larger than the maximum primary
particle size of CJ2.3.E-61, which is consistent with trends in primary
particle sizes for simple sol–gel synthesized aerogels in that
gels made at lower pH have smaller primary particles.

4.4.1.2 pH Effects for CJ3 Aerogels
In Figure 4b, the CJ3.3.B-15 profile shows that a small
intensity stagnation shelf following its Rg1 could be a specific small structure (dimer or trimer
species) that incorporates itself into structures with sizes ranging
across several decades of q instead of forming larger
distinct maximum primary particles. Like CJ2.3.E-61 and CJ2.7.B-15
in Figure 4a, the CJ3.7.A-17
SAXS profile exhibits an Rg2 curve followed by an intensity stagnation shelf representing
a maximum primary particle size for the sample. Although a faint Rg2 curve is indicated on the
CJ3.9.A-15, the certainty of its existence is suspicious as Rg curve fitting could only be performed on one
of the three SAXS profile replicates of CJ3.9.A-15 and the uncertainty
given in Table 6 is
attributed only to fitting uncertainty in Irena. If the Rg2 curve of CJ3.9.A-15 is real, then
it could represent a large structure composed of smaller primary particles
of various sizes. Without knowing the true uncertainty of the Rg2 curve for CJ3.9.A-15, any
proposed explanation is highly speculative.

4.4.1.3 pH Effects for ISG Aerogels
In the mid q region of Figure 4c, SAXS profiles of ISG.3.B-15 and ISG.9.B-45 each have distinct Rg2 knees followed by intensity
stagnation shelves (again representing maximum primary particles sizes),
with Rg values indicated in Table 6. Like CJ3.3.B-15 in Figure 4b, no Rg knees could be assigned to the ISG.7.A-60 profile
in the mid and low q ranges, so the primary particles
may not have a distinct maximum size but vary greatly in sizes across
several decades of q. Based on Rg2 values given in Table 6, ISG.9.B-45 has larger primary particles
than ISG.3.B-15, which is consistent with the trend expected with
simple sol–gel synthesized aerogels, although ISG.7.A-60 shows
no distinct primary particle size to compare to.

4.4.1.4 Composition Effects on Aerogels Synthesized at pH 3
Considering the samples of various compositions made at pH 3 in Figure 4, ISG.3.B-15 has
a smaller maximum primary particle size (Rg2 value) in comparison to the primary particle sizes
in CJ2.3.E-61. ISG.3.B-15 and CJ2.3.E-61 have similar compositions
where ISG.3.B-15 was made with less Na than CJ2.3.E-61 to account
for the addition of Zr and Ca. The pH recorded in step a in ISG.3.B
synthesis in Table 3 is slightly lower than the pH recorded for CJ2.3.E-61 in synthesis
step a, which could explain the difference in Rg2 values rather than significant composition
changes. Large amounts of Ca and lower amounts of Na in CJ3.3.B-15
likely affected the gel structure in comparison to CJ2.3.B-15 and
ISG.3.B-15, which could explain the lack of a maximum primary particle
size for CJ3.3.B-15 at pH 3.

4.4.1.5 Composition
Effects on Aerogels Synthesized at pH 7
For gels in Figure 4 prepared at a targeted
pH 7, CJ3.7.A-17 shows a larger maximum primary particle size (Rg2) than the maximum primary
particle size for CJ2.7.B-15 (see Table 6). Initial pH was not measured for CJ2.7.B,
resulting in difficulty in understanding how the primary particles
were influenced by addition of a catalyst. However, synthesis step
a in Table 3 of batch
CJ2.9.A is identical to that of CJ2.7.B except that the pH of the
batch was measured in CJ2.9.A. The pH measured for CJ2.9.A was 5 in
synthesis step a, so the pH for CJ2.7.B in synthesis step a is likely
pH 5 also. Meanwhile, Table 3 also shows that CJ3.7.A had a pH value of 7 during step a.
Primary particles would be expected to be larger in simple silica
gels made at higher pH, which suggests that initial pH likely impacted
the difference in maximum primary particle sizes between CJ2.7.B-15
and CJ3.7.A-17 rather than the composition effect of Ca addition at
pH 7. No maximum primary particle size was determined for ISG.7.A-60.

The addition of Zr may have caused the discrepancy between ISG.7.A-60
and CJ3.7.A-17. The catalyst was added in synthesis step a for both
CJ3.7.A-17 and ISG.7.A-60, which allowed the pH to be near pH 7 in
each synthesis batch, eliminating any initial pH effects. Previous
work has shown that increasing Zr/Si ratios in gels synthesized via
the sol–gel method lead to larger pores and decreased surface
areas,64 which suggests that Zr would have
an effect on the gel structure. A future study may be conducted on
gels of increasing Zr concentration relevant to this system to further
observe the effects of Zr on the gel structure.

4.4.1.6 Composition Effects on Aerogels Synthesized at pH 9
Out of the samples in Figure 4 prepared at pH 9, only ISG.9.B-45 had its catalyst added
in the beginning of the synthesis (step a in Table 3) as opposed to the end (step f in Table 3), which may have
greatly impacted the formation of primary particles in the gel. ISG.9.B-45
shows a significant intensity stagnation shelf following the Rg2, whereas CJ2.9.B-30 and
CJ3.9.A-15 do not. CJ2.9.B-30 and CJ3.9.A-30 have similar SAXS profiles
despite CJ3.9.A-30 containing Ca and significantly less Na than CJ2.9.B-30,
implying that mixture pH may have a greater impact in gel structure
formation than composition at pH 9.

4.4.2 Physical
Representations of Gel Structures
Figure 5a–c shows 3D representations with
dimensions of 1000 Å × 1000 Å × 1000 Å and
2D cross sections of the 3D structures (1000 Å × 1000 Å)
of sol–gel synthesized gels for compositions CJ2 (CJ2.3.E-61,
CJ2.7.E-15, and CJ2.9.B-15), CJ3 (CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17, and CJ3.9.A-15),
and ISG (ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60, and ISG.9.B-45), respectively. As
described in Section 3.4, the 3D structures are generated from SAXS data, and known
pore fractions for which Figure 5 was generated using the SAXS profiles in Figure 4 and the pore fractions
in Table 5. The relationships
between Rg knees and maximum primary particle
described in Section 4.4.1 are clearly illustrated in Figure 5. For example, Figure 5a shows that the primary particles in CJ2.9.B-30
are larger than those in CJ2.3.E-61 and CJ2.7.B-15, which is expected
based on the Rg2 knees
in Figure 5a. However,
the primary particle differences between CJ2.3.E-61 and CJ2.7.B-15
are more difficult to see due to the existence of Rg3 in CJ2.3.E-61.

and 2D cross sections of the 3D structures (1000 Å × 1000

(CJ2.3.E-61, CJ2.7.E-15, and CJ2.9.B-15), (b) CJ3 (CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17,
and CJ3.9.A-15), and (c) ISG (ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60, and ISG.9.B-45). Green represents a solid material, whereas white represents
pores.

Rg values (especially Rg2 values) are good indicators for the maximum primary particle size,
although there are limitations that can be seen in Figure 5 for CJ3.3.B-15 and ISG.7.A-60.
In Section 4.4.1, the SAXS profiles CJ3.3.B-15 and ISG.7.A-60 did not have Rg knees beyond Rg1, which indicated that there were no maximum primary
particles. Instead, the samples were composed of primary particles
that spanned several decades of sizes. The 3D structures in Figure 5 for CJ3.3.B-15 and
ISG.7.A-60 illustrate what this effect looks like physically, which
is not intuitive when simply evaluating Rg values.

4.4.3 Pore Analysis of Synthetic
Gels
To investigate composition and pH effects on the pores
of the samples, the BJH gas adsorption method was used to analyze
the pores of samples in Table 5. Figure 6a–c
shows BJH distribution plots for samples of compositions CJ2 (CJ2.3.E-61,
CJ2.7.E-15, and CJ2.9.B-15), CJ3 (CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17, and CJ3.9.A-15),
and ISG (ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60, and ISG.9.B-45) with 10% error, respectively.
These measurements only reflect open pores, so they may not reflect
the true pore sizes within the gels.

Figure 6 Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) pore
size distribution plots for samples of compositions (a) CJ2 (CJ2.3.E-61,
CJ2.7.E-15, and CJ2.9.B-15), (b) CJ3 (CJ3.3.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17, and
CJ3.9.A-15), and (c) ISG (ISG.3.B-15, ISG.7.A-60, and ISG.9.B-45)
with 10% error.

In all compositions, the samples
made at pH 3 had the narrowest distribution compared to the samples
made at pH 7 and 9, which had broader distributions across the measurable
range of 20 to 1200 Å. The samples made at pH 9 (CJ2.9.B-30,
CJ3.9.A-15, and ISG.9.B-45) have more large pores (pores > 400
Å) than the samples made at pH 3 (CJ2.3.E-61, CJ3.3.B-15, and
ISG.3.B-15) and pH 7 (CJ2.7.B-15, CJ3.7.A-17, and ISG.7.A-60). ISG.7.A-60
has close to the same amount of large pores as ISG.9.B-45 but has
more large pores (pores > 400 Å) than in CJ2.7.B-15 and CJ3.7.A-17.
For CJ2 and ISG samples, the same pore size (∼200 Å for
CJ2 and ∼150 Å for ISG) is the most abundant size measured.
The most abundant pore size for CJ3.3.B-15 is less than the most abundant
pore sizes for CJ3.7.A-17 and CJ3.9.A-15. The most abundant pore size
for CJ3.7.A-17 is larger than that for CJ3.9.A-15, but the distribution
for CJ3.9.A-15 is broader and extends to larger pore sizes. No systemic
correlation was observed between pH and composition for these samples.
Batch pH affected pore sizes differently for each composition, and
composition did not appear to uniformly affect pore sizes for samples
made under similar pH environments.

5 Summary
and Conclusions
In this study, synthetic gels with custom
compositions relevant to altered nuclear waste glasses were successfully
made by sequential additions of organometallic precursors to a single
reaction vessel. This study focused entirely on the synthesis and
characterizations of the synthetic gels alone, while a separate study
will compare the gels produced in this work with glass alteration
layers of similar compositions formed under comparable conditions.
Other studies have determined pore sizes of alteration layers ranging
from <1 to 8 nm8,15,65−68 where the large variability in pore sizes is due to multiple compositions
of pristine glasses being altered in various conditions. In general,
the pore sizes of the aerogels in this study (<1 to >10 nm)
are consistent with the pore sizes seen for glass alteration layers.
Further pore analysis of glass alteration layers relevant to the aerogels
in this study would reduce the large pore size variability of alteration
layers.

The pH throughout aerogel synthesis proved very difficult
to control. Most batches would form a gel only if the pH was allowed
to freely fluctuate throughout the synthesis. Although the gel structures
were likely affected by fluctuating pH, the pH during the initial
mixing of the batch (after TEOS is added but before Al(OBus)3) seemed to vary with primary particle sizes more consistently than
any other variable evaluated. Literature shows that simple silicate
gels made under basic conditions are composed of polymeric clusters,
whereas samples synthesized under acid conditions values are composed
of entangled linear or randomly branched polymers, which imply that
the basic synthesized gels are composed of particles larger than those
in acid synthesized gels.25,32,44,69 This trend was seen for compositions
CJ2 and ISG at lower pH where gels made at target pH 3 (where pH was
∼3 during the initial step in batch synthesis) had smaller
primary particle sizes than other gels made at target pH values 7
and 9 and gels with CJ2 and CJ3 compositions at higher pH where gels
made at target pH 9 had larger primary particles sizes than the gels
made at target pH 7.

No consistent trends were observed for
composition variances for particle and pore sizes. Because CJ3 and
ISG samples contain more components in the composition than CJ2, the
additional components of Ca and Zr likely influenced the gel structure
more than Si, Al, and Na. Although studies have discussed the effects
of Zr and Ca on gels with Si,24,70−72 no studies have been found to discuss the effects of Zr and Ca within
a matrix containing Al and Na also. Thus, Zr and Ca coordination with
gel structures is difficult to predict. Future studies could be done
to determine these effects.

Aging appeared to cause little to
no difference in primary particle size distributions, whereas SCD
samples (aerogels) had fewer small primary particles compared to EtOH-immersed
samples (alcogels).
