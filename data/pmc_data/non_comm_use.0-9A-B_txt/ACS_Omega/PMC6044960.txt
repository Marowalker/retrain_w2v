In the living cell, biomolecules
perform their respective functions
in the presence of not only one type of macromolecules but rather
in the presence of various macromolecules with different shapes and
sizes. In this study, we have investigated the effects of five single
macromolecular crowding agents, Dextran 6, Dextran 40, Dextran 70,
Ficoll 70, and PEG 8000 and their binary mixtures on the modulation
in the domain separation of human serum albumin using a Förster
resonance energy transfer-based approach and the translational mobility
of a small fluorescent probe fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) using
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Our observations suggest
that mixed crowding induces greater cooperativity in the domain movement
as compared to the components of the mixtures. Thermodynamic analyses
of the same provide evidence of crossovers from enthalpy-based interactions
to effects dominated by hard-sphere potential. When compared with
those obtained for individual crowders, both domain movements and
FITC diffusion studies show significant deviations from ideality,
with an ideal solution being considered to be that arising from the
sum of the contributions of those obtained in the presence of individual
crowding agents. Considering the fact that domain movements are local
(on the order of a few angstroms) in nature while translational movements
span much larger lengthscales, our results imply that the observed
deviation from simple additivity exists at several possible levels
or lengthscales in such mixtures. Moreover, the nature and the type
of deviation not only depend on the identities of the components of
the crowder mixtures but are also influenced by the particular face
of the serum protein (either the domain I–II or the domain
II–III face) that the crowders interact with, thus providing
further insights into the possible existence of microheterogeneities
in such solutions.

Introduction
Biochemical studies
of macromolecules are often done in dilute
solutions where the macromolecular concentration is in the range of
1–10 g/L.1−4 These dilute environments differ dramatically from the interiors
of cells or extracellular matrices of tissues and cartilages where
the biological macromolecules are known to function.4−6 Real biological environments contain a high density of macromolecular
solutes (proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, etc.) as a part
of the same medium where the test protein locates.7,8 Depending
upon the specific organelle, the total occupancy by macromolecules
can be in the range of 5–40% of the available volume, corresponding
to 50–400 g/L of the total macromolecular concentration. Traditionally,
macromolecular crowding has been explained based on the “excluded
volume” effect1−6 arising from the mutual impenetrability of the involved species,
the latter being treated as hard spheres. In this regard, a multitude
of processes such as the protein folding–unfolding reaction,9−11 protein–protein association,12−14 protein aggregation,15,16 to name a few, have been shown to be appreciably affected by the
presence of macromolecular crowding agents. From the increase in enzymatic
activity to the increase in protein–protein association rates
and enhancement of aggregation kinetics, synthetic crowding agents
have already been reported to exhibit significant influence. Of late,
studies using protein-based crowding agents have reported a shift
in paradigm where enthalpy-based soft interactions were observed to
gain prominence over hard-sphere-based steric interactions.17−21

Recent years have seen a considerable increase in the number
of
reports addressing issues and effects that a crowded milieu can have
on biomolecular conformation, dynamics, and diffusion.22−32 However, one aspect that has received far less attention is the
fact that the crowded interior is not composed of only one macromolecule
in high concentration but is rather made up of many different kinds
of such molecules. Thus, studies in the presence of mixed crowders
are essential but are quite rare to come across.33−38 Using optimum mixtures of Dextran 70 or Ficoll 70 and the protein-based
crowder bovine serum albumin during the refolding of lysozyme, it
was observed that not only was the refolding yield increased significantly
as compared to that of the component crowders, but also the kinetics
of the oxidative refolding process of the enzyme was enhanced to a
considerable extent.33 A similar effect
on the refolding and kinetics of rabbit muscle creatine kinase was
also shown in mixed crowded environments, with calf thymus DNA and
Ficoll 70 (or Dextran 70 or PEG 200) forming the binary crowder mixtures.37 The stability of the lysozyme was found to be
increased, while its activity decreased in the presence of mixtures
of Dextran 70 and Ficoll 70.39 An optimum
mixing ratio of crowders of different sizes, the latter allowing tunability
of the mixture types, has been proposed to have the most stabilizing
effect on proteins.35 Moreover, the nonadditive
effect of binary crowder mixtures on protein stability has also been
brought to the fore.36,39 While all these aforementioned
reports allude to the advantage that a mixed crowding scenario has
in connection with protein refolding and stability and hence the physiological
importance of the same, further support of this fact was obtained
from a report wherein the mixed crowding system (in an optimized mixing
ratio) inhibited the formation of protein (lysozyme) aggregates.40 Usage of the concept of mixed crowders has been
further extended, wherein the stability of the protein chymotrypsin
inhibitor 2 (CI2) was monitored in the presence of reconstituted bacterial
cytosol. It was observed that contrary to general expectations, the
cytosol, which is a mixture of many proteins, destabilized CI2, this
phenomenon being attributed to the nonspecific attractive interactions
that the test protein experienced in the cytosol.38

Keeping the importance of mixed crowding in mind
and its relevance
to the physiological interior and the paucity of existing studies
on the same, we have tried to provide much needed insights into this
phenomenon from two different perspectives as follows: (a) conformational
modulation of the multidomain protein human serum albumin (HSA) →
wherein we have mapped domain movements based on Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) in the presence of binary mixtures of crowding
agents and (b) solvent perspective → where we have monitored
the changes in diffusion characteristics of the fluorescent reporter,
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
(FCS) in the presence of the same mixtures as used for the FRET study.
The binary mixtures of several commonly used synthetic macromolecular
crowders (Dextran 6, Dextran 40, Dextran 70, Ficoll 70, and PEG 8000)
have been used here as a mimic of the congested cellular interior.
The choice of HSA as the protein under study is based on the fact
that it is not only a known avid transporter of small molecules and
fatty acids (FAs) and hence functionally quite important but also
is composed of three domains (I, II, and III) (Figure 1A). With regards to its physiological function,
the binding of ligands to serum protein has been extensively studied
in dilute solutions,41−45 and the protein has also been well-characterized with respect to
its structure and dynamics. Recent papers have shown that the structure
of HSA is significantly modulated in the presence of crowding agents.46−48 Keeping in mind the fact that the serum protein undergoes large
scale domain movements (angular displacements) when binding to FAs49,50 and also exhibits allostery on ligand binding,51,52 understanding and trying to comprehend the manner in which such
displacements are affected in a mixed crowding scenario is of immense
importance. Indeed, it has been shown that extent of FA binding to
HSA and the number of relevant binding sites on the protein are modulated
in a crowded environment.53 Moreover, HSA
being quite a large protein, it itself sweeps a considerable volume
even in the native state, thereby increasing the chances of it getting
perturbed in the presence of the crowders. While the domain movement
is quite local in nature, translational diffusion studies as monitored
using FCS cover a larger lengthscale over which the reporter diffuses
in the mixed crowding environment, thereby allowing us to monitor
the extent of complexity “on the offer” under such conditions.

legend].

Our results suggest that mixed
crowding has the effect of making
protein motions more cooperative, thereby having an important effect
in the protein folding and denaturation pathways. Thermodynamic analyses
based on the cooperative interdomain movements provide a unique insight
into the manner in which the individual components of the mixtures
affect the serum protein, with features in transitions representing
crossovers from soft enthalpy-based interactions to effects dominated
by excluded volume-type interactions. Moreover, the nature of the
domain movement and modulations in tracer diffusion imply that the
mixed crowder solutions deviate appreciably from ideality, with the
extent of deviation also depending on the nature of the component
macromolecular crowding agents in the mixtures. Finally, with domain
movements providing insights into the crowder arrangement in the immediate
vicinity of the protein, this in combination with the translation
diffusion studies suggest that nonideality exists over several orders
of length scales, arguably from angstroms to nanometers, thereby further
highlighting the importance of a mixed crowding scenario and its underlying
complexity.

Results and Discussion
We have studied a total of seven
binary mixtures of some commonly
used macromolecular crowders, namely, Dextran 6 in Dextran 40, Dextran
6 in Dextran 70, Dextran 6 in Ficoll 70, Dextran 6 in PEG 8, Dextran
40 in Dextran 70, Dextran 40 in Ficoll 70, and Dextran 70 in Ficoll
70, thereby encompassing a range of shapes and sizes along with differences
in the structure of the crowders at the molecular level. These synthetic
crowders are not only highly soluble in water but also are neutral
by nature. Additionally, these have been proposed to be inert and
hence exert their effects mainly through excluded volume. Moreover,
the variation in the average molecular weight is synonymous with the
variation in the respective sizes of the crowders, thereby allowing
us the flexibility of tuning the excluded volume that HSA is exposed
to on an individual crowder basis and more so in the binary mixtures.
For example, Dextran 6 reportedly has a hydrodynamic radius of ∼1.7
nm, with the larger-sized dextrans, namely, Dextran 40 and Dextran
70, having radii of ∼4.8 and ∼6.8 nm, respectively.54 While dextrans have often been likened to being
rod-like in shape (though reports exist of this crowder behaving more
like a random coil), Ficoll 70, having a hydrodynamic radius of ∼5.1
nm,55,56 has been considered to have a structure
that is an intermediate between that of a sphere and a random coil.
The choice of PEG 8000, which unlike the aforementioned ones, is not
an ideal inert crowding agent as it is known to interact with proteins,
was not only because of its molecular weight being similar to that
of Dextran 6 but also because of the fact that it is a linear open-chain
polymer as opposed to the others that are typically constrained to
a certain extent by the cyclic ring systems of the component sugar
moieties. Because polymers are known to entangle as a function of
concentration, comparison of influence of the mixtures of the different
polymers with that of their individual components should provide us
insights into the manner in which the different crowders interact
with each other and hence allow us to have a better idea about the
mixed crowding phenomenon. Thus, the different binary combinations
that we have employed in this study not only span different sizes,
leading to gradation in packing densities, but also invoke the possibility
of probing multiple interactions between the component crowders at
the molecular level.

These mixtures were then examined based
on their effects on (i)
domain separation (r) of the multidomain protein
HSA using steady-state FRET and (ii) diffusion of a fluorophore (FITC)
using FCS. While the former provides insights into how HSA adjusts
and adapts its geometry to reach a stable conformation, the latter
throws light onto the manner in which the polymers are entangled.
Because FITC is essentially nonperturbing when compared to HSA, with
the latter through its hydrophilic–hydrophobic points of contact
being able to dictate the crowder assembly around itself,25 this study stands to provide a detailed insight
into the mixed crowding milieu. For FRET studies, HSA was individually
labeled covalently either at Cys-34 of domain I by the probe acrylodan
(Ac) or at Tyr-411 by p-nitrophenyl anthranilate
(NPA). These fluorophores are acceptors of the energy transferred
from the donor Trp-214, the lone tryptophan residue of HSA. For FCS
measurements, FITC was used as the probe for monitoring changes in
its diffusion in the aforementioned mixtures of macromolecular crowding
agents.

FRET Analysis of the Domain Movement in HSA
Individual Crowders
The addition of Dextran 6 leads
to an increase in the distance between the Trp–Ac FRET pair.
As evident from Figure 1B, the separation (r) between domains I and II increases
steadily with the increasing Dextran 6 concentration (∼75–100
g/L), leading to an appreciable decrease in the efficiency of energy
transfer. The steepest increase was observed for the 25–100
g/L crowder concentration range, while beyond this, the change was
gradual, thereby reflecting on the enhanced restriction in the domain
movement of the protein under these conditions, arising understandably
from the limited space available to HSA amidst the sea of crowder
molecules. On the other hand, for the same concentration range of
Dextran 6, domains II and III moved closer to each other (Figure 1C). In the presence
of the crowder Dextran 40, both domains I and III move toward domain
II, showing correlated motion, with major portion of the changes having
taken place by 75 g/L. Similar to that of Dextran 40, in the presence
of Dextran 70 also, the motions of domains I and III remain correlated
in that both show a sizeable decrease in the interdomain separation
with respect to domain II. While Ficoll 70 brings about the maximum
decrease in the distance for domains I and II, it also induces increase
in the separation between domains II and III (Figure 1B,C). Finally, for PEG 8000, we observed
increasing interdomain compaction (domains I and II) up to 75 g/L,
beyond which the Trp–Ac FRET pair moved farther from one another.
However, in the case of domains II–III, just the reverse happened
(Figure 1B,C). Our
FRET data thus show that the crowder-induced domain movements of HSA
are dependent not only on the concentration of the crowding agent
but also on the shape and size of the crowder molecule. These results
are in good agreement with our recent report, wherein we had monitored
the domain separation as a function of the pH-induced denatured states
of HSA.47

Mixed Macromolecular Crowding
Figure 2 (panels
A and B) and Supporting Information Figures
S1–S7 show how the distances
between the domains based on the Trp–Ac (domains I and II)
and Trp–NPA (domains II and III) FRET pairs are modulated in
the presence of the different binary mixtures of crowders used. The
total crowder concentration at any given data point was always kept
at 200 g/L throughout. On the basis of this, for domains I–II,
the interdomain separation undergoes an appreciable increase for the
binary mixtures of Dextran 6 with either Dextran 40, Dextran 70, or
Ficoll 70. This trend was expected because as shown in Figure 1B, Dextran 6 increased the
separation of domains I and II while the other higher molecular weight
crowders induced the domains to approach each other. Thus, in line
with the same argument, the “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70”
mixture showed very little distance change as one moved from Dextran
70 (200 g/L) only to Dextran 40 (200 g/L). Closer analysis of the
two panels of Figure 2 reveals the differences in the manner in which the mixed crowding
influences the separation of domains I–II and II–III,
an aspect that we have also observed in our recent report,47 this being directly related to the behavior
induced by the individual crowders as mentioned above.

distances for domain I–II (A) and
II–III (B) in mixed macromolecular crowding with the following
color codes: “Dextran 6 + Dextran 40” (black); “Dextran
6 + Dextran 70” (red); “Dextran 6 + Dextran 70”
(blue); “Dextran 6 + PEG 8” (magenta); “Dextran
40 + Dextran 70” (green); “Dextran 40 + Ficoll 70”
(yellow); “Dextran 70 + Ficoll 70” (violet); [along
the arrowhead, the increment of the respective crowder indicated for
a binary mixture is as follows: Dextran 6 increases along the x-axis in all the four mixtures having this crowder as one
of the components; Dextran 70 increases along the x-axis in the “Dextran 70 + Ficoll 70” mixture; Dextran
40 increases along the x-axis in the “Dextran
40 + Ficoll 70” and “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70”
mixtures].

To further probe the differences
in the mixed crowding scenario,
we have plotted the Δr values based on eqs 15 and 16 in the same panel (Figures 3–5 and Supporting Information Figures S8–S11).
As observed from Figure 3 for the “Dextran 6 + Dextran 40” mixture, beyond 75
g/L Dextran 6, a distinct difference is seen between the two Δr trends for domain I–II separation, with the mixture
resulting in a larger difference. It was surprising that such an effect
was carried on even up till 175 g/L Dextran 6 (and 25 g/L Dextran
40). For a given weight of macromolecular crowding agents, lower the
molecular weight of a crowder, higher will be the number density of
that crowder. Thus, at 175 g/L Dextran 6, wherein the number density
is overwhelmingly more than that of Dextran 40, the mismatch in the
Δr values was least expected. In the case of
domains II–III (Figure 3B), domain motion stalls beyond 125 g/L of Dextran 6 and 75
g/L Dextran 40. To further aid our understanding of the data, in the
inset to each of the panels of Figure 3, we have also plotted ΔΔr (defined as ΔΔr = Δrmc – ΣΔr); it is a
reflection of deviation from the so-called ideal mixture, the latter
being considered equal to the sum of the effects seen for the individual
crowder components of the binary mixture. As seen from the inset to Figure 3A, the deviation
is quite high, that is, of the order of 4 Å, and that too at
150 g/L Dextran 6. Under similar circumstances, the deviation is much
less for domains II and III, thus further showing the dissimilar nature
of interactions for the two domain faces (domains I–II and
domains II–III) of HSA with the crowders.

Figure 3 Variation of Δr as a function of the crowder
concentration in (A) mixed crowding environment (Δrmc = rmc – r0; eq 15) and (B) sum of individual crowders (ΣΔr = ΔrC1(X) + ΔrC2(200–X)); eq 16, where C1 and C2 are Dextran
6 and Dextran 40, respectively. [Inset shows the variation of ΔΔr (ΔΔr = Δrmc – ΣΔr)].

function of the crowder
concentration in (A) mixed crowding environment (Δrmc = rmc – r0; eq 15) and (B) sum of individual crowders (ΣΔr = ΔrC1(X) + ΔrC2(200–X)); eq 16, where C1 and C2 are Dextran
70 and Ficoll 70, respectively. [Inset shows the variation of ΔΔr (ΔΔr = Δrmc – ΣΔr)].

Figure 5 Variation of Δr as a
function of the crowder
concentration in (A) mixed crowding environment (Δrmc = rmc – r0; eq 15) and (B) sum of individual crowders (ΣΔr = ΔrC1(X) + ΔrC2(200–X)); eq 16, where C1 and C2 are Dextran
40 and Dextran 70, respectively. [Inset shows the variation of ΔΔr (ΔΔr = Δrmc – ΣΔr)].

Similar analyses were also carried
out for all the other binary
mixtures. For domains I–II, in the presence of the mixtures
of “Dextran 6 + Dextran 70” (Supporting Information Figure S8A) and “Dextran 6 + Ficoll 70”
(Supporting Information Figure S9A), the
agreement between the two Δr values is quite
similar. This implies either of the following: (i) Dextran 70 and
Ficoll 70 are very similar in their behavior or (ii) Dextran 6 is
the main component that decides the profile that we observe. Comparison
of the Δr profiles for the Dextran 70 and Ficoll
70 mixture (Figure 4) reveals that the effect so observed for the mixture of these high
molecular weight crowders is not additive (inset to Figure 4A), that is, there exists significant
differences between the Δrmc values
obtained from the mixture and from the sum of the individual crowders
(ΣΔr), for domains I and II. This thus
suggests that it is Dextran 6 that drives the Δr trends, an aspect that is expected based on the high packing density
of Dextran 6 and also its influence being more of the excluded volume
type. Furthermore, the “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70” mixture
(Figure 5A) induces
a large disparity in the Δr values for domains
I and II, with Δrmc being lower
than that of ΣΔr implying that the mixture
gives rise to a lower change in the interdomain distance as compared
to its components when considered together in isolation. The same
mixture, however, gives rise to very little difference for domains
II and III (Figure 5B), again hinting at the differences that the two faces of HSA exude.
Moreover, for the mixtures involving Dextran 6 as one of its constituents,
ΔΔr is positive for the distance between
domains I and II while the same is negative for domains II and III,
further confirming the dissimilarity between the two HSA faces. For
the “Dextran 6 + PEG 8000” mixture (Supporting Information Figure S10), the deviation from so-called
ideality peaks at 125 g/L Dextran 6, that is, where the PEG concentration
is 75 g/L. Such an effect is reminiscent of the fact that PEG 8000
induces a change in the direction of the domain movement for both
the domains (I and III) with respect to domain II, at that concentration
(Figure 1). Additionally,
the large deviation observed for the domain II–III distance
with ΔΔr of ∼−6 Å,
the maximum observed for the mixtures studied here, can be hypothesized
to be arising from the changeover from a predominantly excluded volume
type interaction until 125 g/L Dextran 6 (or 75 g/L of PEG 8000) to
a competition between the interaction governed by electrostatics between
PEG and HSA and excluded volume as exerted by Dextran 6.

A common
feature for all the mixtures is that the variation in
the interdomain distance r (for the mixtures) is
quite cooperative, despite the fact that changes in r for the individual crowders do not show any such trend (Supporting Information Figures S2–S7).
To address the cooperative nature of the trends as a function of the
mixture composition, we have also analyzed these changes based on
existing thermodynamic models (eq 5–14) for both pairs of
domains, I–II and II–III (Supporting Information Figure S12). Depending on the nature of the transitions
and the domains involved, the transitions were either fitted to a
two-state (eq 10) or
a three-state (eq 12) model. The corresponding free energy (ΔG0(H2O)) changes were thereby obtained from
the fits and have been tabulated in Tables 1 and 2. On the basis
of our previous hypothesis, the effect of Dextran 6 is predominantly
due to that of excluded volume that is entropy-driven, while the large
macromolecular crowders such as Dextran 40 or Ficoll 70 show appreciable
soft interactions that are enthalpic in origin.46,47 As evident from the Tables 1 and 2, for domains I and II, the binary
mixtures of Dextran 6 with the higher molecular weight crowders induced
a three-state transition, while in the case of the domain II–III
distance, for the same mixed crowders, the transition was primarily
two-state. A similar switch in the nature of transition is also observed
for the large molecular weight crowder mixtures but in a reverse manner,
that is, the two-state process for domains I and II became three-state
in the case of domains II and III. These data thus reveal significant
differences in the overall nature of interaction potential presented
by the two faces of HSA, which is in agreement with our recent findings.47

The presence of intermediates, we
propose, arises from a change
in the nature of the interactions of the crowders with the protein.
For example, for the domain I–II separation, the presence of
the intermediate likely implies a crossover from soft (enthalpy-based)
potential to a more hard-sphere-like potential, the latter being the
predominant effect as per the classical excluded volume theory. Thus,
in cases where the transition from the protein ensemble (M1) in pure crowder 1 to the ensemble existing in the presence of pure
crowder 2 (M2) is predominantly two-state, it suggests
that either there is no aforementioned crossover observed or that
the serum protein is insensitive to the same. The first option is
not a viable one because there is no reason to believe that the same
binary mixture by itself will be behaving differently for the two
sets of domain pairs, I–II and II–III. Taking into account
the fact that the domain II–III face is a polar one while that
of the I–II face is more on the hydrophobic side, the observed
changes in the nature of the transitions match the different interaction
potential that these faces exude, as we have alluded to in the previous
section based on the ΔΔr values. To explain
a bit more clearly, let us consider the example of the binary mixture
of Dextran 6 and Ficoll 70. The domain I–II side being predominantly
hydrophobic,47 it exhibits appreciable
soft interactions with Ficoll 70 as also shown by the large change
in the interdomain distance in the presence of this crowder (Figure 1A). With Dextran
6 influencing conformational modulations predominantly through excluded
volume, the intermediate is a probable signature of this change from
hydrophobic influence (soft interactions) to hard-sphere potential.
Moreover, for this mixture, ΔG2→In0 is greater
than ΔGIn→10, with ΔG2→In0 characterizing
the phase where the Dextran 6 concentration increases, that is, excluded
volume takes over. Such a profile is maintained throughout for “Dextran
6 + Dextran 40” and “Dextran 6 + Dextran 70”
mixtures, with “Dextran 6 + Ficoll 70” exhibiting the
largest combined ΔG0 (ΔGIn→10 + ΔG2→In0). The latter can be explained based
on the fact that Ficoll 70 shows the maximum soft interactions (hydrophobic
in nature) with the protein (as noted from the large distance change
for this crowder when probed individually). Using the same approach
for domains II–III for these Dextran 6 mixtures, the absence
of intermediate (I) is due to the fact that this face being more polar,
it does not exhibit extensive interactions with the polymeric backbones
of the high molecular weight crowders. In other words, it experiences
only one type of interaction, that is, the excluded volume effect,
thereby making the transition two-state.

Further support of
our hypothesis comes from consideration of the
mixtures of high molecular weight crowders of “Dextran 40 +
Dextran 70” and “Dextran 70 + Ficoll 70”. Because
all these through their extended backbone interact with the serum
protein via hydrophobic interactions, the “not-so-polar”
face of HSA, as described by domains I–II, is subjected to
similar interactions throughout the variation in the binary mixture
composition, resulting in a two-state transition. Dextran 70 and 40
are flexible, long-chain polymers of d-glucose with sparse,
short branches and are better modeled as rod-like particles. Because
of their similar shapes and similar extents of domain movements on
an individual basis, the “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70” mixture
gives rise to the least domain motion, as evident from Figure 2. Similarly, the two-state
transition for these two domains in presence of the “Dextran
6 + PEG 8000” binary mixture is reasoned out based on the fact
that at the high PEG 8 concentration, excluded volume predominates,
and the same feature is expected to be in operation for Dextran 6
too.

To get an idea of the dependence of the Gibbs free energy
change
∑ΔG (only ΔG to
be considered where the transition is two-state) as a function of
the total change in the interdomain distance Δr′ (where Δr′ = rcrowder 1(200g/L) – rcrowder 2(200g/L)) at the two extremes of the mixture
crowder concentrations, we have plotted ∑ΔG against Δr′ in Figure 6. For both pairs of domains (I–II
and II–III), the variation of free energy change is overall
linear, with domains I–II showing better compliance with linearity
than II–III. In other words, larger change in free energy is
associated with a higher change in the interdomain distance (Δr′). Representative plots of HSA and labeled HSA,
based on which FRET efficiency was calculated, have been presented
in Supporting Information Figure S13. For
domains II–III, the “Dextran 6 + PEG 8000” mixture
is a complete outlier, that is, a higher free energy change is associated
with a much smaller change in the distance. This is again a reflection
of the strong nature of electrostatic interactions that PEG 8000 exhibits
with HSA, thereby bringing about a greater change in free energy than
what was expected.

FCS Studies of Translational Diffusion
FCS experiments
were carried out to measure the diffusion time of the reporter molecule
FITC in the presence of various macromolecular crowding agents. FCS
is based on the measurement of temporal intensity fluctuations of
the relevant fluorophore as it diffuses in and out of the confocal
volume57−60 and subsequently correlating these fluctuations according to the
following equation 1  where δF(t) = F(t) – ⟨F(t)⟩ is the fluorescence fluctuation,
with ⟨F(t)⟩ being
the average fluorescence intensity over the defined time period. The
decay of the correlation function G(τ) provides
us a measure of the timescales involved in processes such as diffusion,61,62 rotational relaxation,63 conformational
dynamics,64,65 and triplet-state photo-physics66,67 that bring about fluctuations in the fluorescence of the fluorophore
under investigation.

All the autocorrelation curves were fitted
well using eq 1 having
a single diffusion time (τD) (Supporting Information Figure S14). FITC in buffer only (i.e.,
in absence of crowders) gave rise to a diffusion time (τ0) of 130 ± 10 μs. Prior to investigating the diffusion
characteristics of mixed crowding agents, the diffusion times of FITC
(τD) in the individual crowders were measured as
a function of the crowder concentration. To facilitate comparison,
we have plotted τD/τ0 against the
concentration of the crowding agents, where τD is
the diffusion time of FITC in the presence of crowding agents and
τ0 is the diffusion time of FITC in a simple buffer.
Our FCS measurements show that the diffusion time of FITC increases
remarkably in the presence of all the macromolecular crowding agents
as a function of the concentration (Supporting Information Figure S15). Data reveal that the increase in the
diffusion time of FITC is highest in the presence of Ficoll 70 and
lowest in the presence of Dextran 6.

Having performed these
experiments in the presence of the individual
crowding agents, our main focus was to probe the diffusion behavior
of FITC in the presence of mixtures of the same binary crowders that
were used for the FRET studies mentioned before. Again, the total
crowder concentration was kept at 200 g/L. Figure 7A shows the changes in diffusion times as
a function of the mixture compositions. As expected, in cases where
the diffusion times of the individual components differ by a huge
margin, the change in the τD/τ0 value
is quite steep, as exemplified by the “Dextran 6 + Ficoll 70”
mixture. To get further insights from the obtained data, we have also
plotted the difference in relative diffusion times  obtained from the mixture
and the sum of
the relative diffusion times obtained from the respective individual
crowders in Figure 7B as follows 2  

Figure 7 (A) Plot of τD/τ0 of FITC vs
crowder concentration for the mixed crowders (the concentration of
Dextran 6 increases along the x-axis in all the four
mixtures having this crowder as one of the components; Dextran 70
increases along the x-axis in the “Dextran
70 + Ficoll 70” mixture; Dextran 40 increases along the x-axis in the “Dextran 40 + Ficoll 70” and
“Dextran 40 + Dextran 70” mixtures). (B)  plotted as a function
of the crowder concentration
with the x-axis being identical to that in (A).

These plots provide some very
interesting insights into the manner
in which the diffusion time of FITC in mixed crowding agents is different
from that of the individual crowders. τD/τ0 for a particular concentration of mixed crowding agents is
always higher than that of the sum of the individual crowding agents
at that concentration, except at the extremes where there is only
one crowding agent (Supporting Information Figure S16). Moreover, the disparity in diffusion times of FITC
is dependent on the nature of the components of the crowding mixtures.
For example, the deviation is maximum for the “Dextran 70 +
Ficoll 70” mixture followed by that of “Dextran 40 +
Ficoll 70” and “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70” mixtures,
with the latter two showing very similar behavior. In other words,
the differences are much more pronounced in the case of the larger
crowding agent mixtures as compared to those where at least one of
the components is Dextran 6 (Supporting Information Figure S16).

The diffusion of a molecule is affected primarily
because of changes
in the microviscosity arising from the manner in which the macromolecular
crowding agents self-assemble/entangle in solution.68−70 On the basis
of the fact that  (from  and ; Rh is the
hydrodynamic radius, D is the diffusion coefficient,
and η is the viscosity) and assuming η0, the
viscosity of water, to be 1.0 cP at 25 °C, the ratio of the diffusion
times provides a direct readout of the intrinsic viscosity, more properly
referred to as microviscosity, of the systems having crowding agents,
either alone or in mixed form. In other words, our data show that
the microviscosity of the mixtures is always higher than the sum of
the microviscosities of the individual crowding agents (Figure 7B) at their respective mixture
concentrations. These suggest that the crowder molecules in the mixtures
are always present in a more entangled form than that of the individual
crowder components, such that the resistance to translation motion
so faced by the tracer molecule is higher. Moreover, the deviation
from the so-called ideality being more for the high molecular weight
crowder mixtures is an indication of the enhanced entanglement among
these, an aspect that can be logically deduced from the long polymeric
chains of these crowder molecules available for network formation.

A few other interesting features also emerge from a closer analysis
of Figure 7B. For the
“Dextran 70 + Ficoll 70” mixture, the aforementioned
deviation in microviscosity is maximum at 50 g/L Dextran 70 and 150
g/L Ficoll 70, which signifies that at this point, the entanglement
between Dextran 70 and Ficoll 70 is also at its maximum. In other
words, for these particular concentrations, the interactions between
Dextran 70 and Ficoll 70 are most favorable. Subsequently with the
increasing concentration of Dextran 70 and decreasing Ficoll 70, the
microviscosity decreases, which suggests that the Dextran 70 polymeric
units start entangling among themselves rather than the Ficoll 70
molecules (Figure 7B). The subsequent decrease in entanglement and hence  at higher Dextran 70
concentrations can
be attributed to the difference in morphologies of the crowder molecules.
Ficoll 70 has been assumed to be more spherical in shape while Dextran
70 is more rod-like. Hence, it is understandable that such a morphological
mismatch starts exerting its influence once the Dextran 70 concentration
is high enough that self-entanglement becomes thermodynamically more
viable. Similarly, for “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70” and
“Dextran 40 + Ficoll 70” mixtures, the microviscosity
mismatch peaks at 125 and 150 g/L Dextran 40, respectively, with the
difference showing a steeper drop beyond that in the presence of Ficoll
70, probably because of the shape mismatch between the two crowding
agents. On the other hand, the difference is much less for the mixtures
involving Dextran 6 (Supporting Information Figure S16), and the trends in mismatch are also quite similar (Figure 7B). Because Dextran
6 has been established to be exerting predominantly excluded volume
effect, the level of entanglement with all the other crowding agents
remains more or less the same. Furthermore, our data suggest that
the formation of entanglement between crowder molecules in a binary
mixture is more favorable where the sizes, as defined by the average
molecular weight, of the crowder molecules are similar.

To further
investigate the behavior of mixed crowding agents, we
have performed the FCS measurements of FITC in the presence of another
set of the binary mixture of macromolecular crowding agents where
the crowders have been used in a 50:50 (1:1) ratio for each, the ratio
being in terms of the weight of crowder dissolved. For example, a
100 g/L crowding mixture is composed of 50 g/L of each individual
crowding agent. Here, we have plotted the τD/τ0 value against each mixed crowding concentration (Figure 8). This figure clearly
indicates that at higher concentrations, the increasing trend in the
τD/τ0 value is higher for the larger
crowder mixture, that is, “Ficoll 70 + Dextran 70”,
“Ficoll 70 + Dextran 40”, and “Dextran 70 + Dextran
40”, as compared to that observed for the mixtures where D6
is present. These data thus support our previous conclusion that the
entanglement between the component crowders is less for the mixture
where the difference in size is more, that is, where Dextran 6 is
present. Again, we have plotted the τD/τ0 value of the sum of the individual crowding agents and obtained
the τD/τ0 value of their mixtures
(Supporting Information Figure S17). At
higher concentrations, as expected, each mixture shows higher τD/τ0 value than that of the sum of the individual
crowding agents, which suggests that under these conditions, the entanglement
between crowders is much more pronounced and hence the microviscosities
of mixed crowding agents are more than the individual crowding agents.
However, the scenario is completely different at lower concentrations,
wherein the microviscosity experienced by FITC of the mixed crowding
agents is slightly less or almost similar as compared to that observed
from the sum of their individual crowding agents. For “Dextran
40 + Dextran 70” and “Ficoll 70 + Dextran 6”
mixtures, the microviscosity of the individual crowding components
is almost additive upto 100 g/L, whereas the microviscosity of the
mixtures are significantly higher than the sum of the individual crowding
agents beyond 100 g/L. Thus, at lower concentrations, the individual
polymer molecules do not show any cross interactions, resulting in
the additivity of the microviscosities. At higher concentrations,
the marked deviations in between the two profiles again suggest increased
entanglement with the differences being larger wherein Ficoll 70 is
one of the constituents (Supporting Information Figure S17A,B). Hence, as evident, the internal architecture of
the mixture of crowding agents depends on the nature of the individual
crowder components.

Summary and Conclusions
The cellular environment comprises
a heterogeneous mixture of proteins,
nucleic acids, ribosomes, and carbohydrates (polysaccharides), each
of which is likely to affect the folding mechanism of different proteins
in its own distinctive fashion.4,6,22,71−75 The excluded volume theory predicts that a high concentration
of “inert” macromolecules should stabilize the compact
native state relative to any less compact unfolded or partially folded
state of the polypeptide. We extended our idea of mixed macromolecular
crowding to study the effects of binary mixtures of crowders on the
domain movement of the multidomain protein, HSA, by mapping the changes
in interdomain distances. We observe that mixed crowding induces significant
cooperativity in the domain motion as compared to that of the individual
crowders, a feature that bears tremendous significance with regard
to the folding energy landscape of this serum protein in that domain
interfaces have been hypothesized to play a critical role in the overall
folding of the multidomain protein (see below). Cooperativity in protein
folding is associated with the negligible presence of intermediates
in between the folded and the unfolded states, that is, the folding–unfolding
transition being primarily two-state.76,77 However, multidomain
proteins have been known to exhibit a certain degree of noncooperativity,
primarily because of the existence of domains that are capable of
folding independently.77 The presence of
cooperativity has been proposed to be advantageous because the absence
of partially folded–unfolded states would tend to decrease
the chances of that particular protein to aggregate.78,79 Moreover, as mentioned above, in proteins having multiple domains,
the existence of a cooperative transition is often dictated by interactions
present at the domain–domain interfaces because it is the magnitude
of such forces that primarily make the transitions deviate from an
“all or none” (cooperative) process. Thus, in our case,
the manner in which the domains move relative to each other as a function
of the crowders can be considered to be a strong signature of how
well-connected the domain interfaces are, that is, how cooperative
the protein is under the given conditions. Thus, the observation that
in the presence of the single crowders (Figure 1) the domains move rather gradually as the
crowder concentration is varied implies that the protein goes through
multiple intermediates. On the other hand, crowders are also known
to enhance aggregation tendency. Thus, combining this noncooperativity
of the domain motion of HSA and aggregation enhancing propensity of
the crowders, it seems that in the presence of a single macromolecular
crowding agent, the protein is being almost tuned to becoming more
aggregation-prone. With the binary crowder mixtures, however, this
condition stands quite alleviated as the protein always experiences
a high enough crowder concentration, with the only caveat being that
the composition changes. Hence, the increase in cooperativity that
becomes evident in the mixtures is probably one of the means by which
in spite of the high degree of crowding inside the cells, aggregation
is less predominant, thereby bringing to the fore one of the advantages
that a mixed crowding scenario offers.

Also, a distinct crossover
between two different types of forces,
namely, entropic and enthalpic, was observed in terms of the presence
of intermediate states and increased ΣΔG values. A closer look at Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the obtained
three-state transitions and the proposed crossover arises mainly for
those mixtures where either the difference in the average molecular
weight is high (e.g., “Dextran 6 + Ficoll 70” in Table 1) or where there is
a considerable difference in the gross architecture of the crowders
(e.g., “Dextran 40 + Ficoll 70” and “Dextran
6 + PEG 8” in Table 2). It should also be noted that for the three-state transition
cases, wherever Dextran 6 is involved, the change in free energy for
the second step which occurs when the Dextran 6 concentration is increased,
is always on the higher side, a feature that we propose is a signature
of the effect of Dextran 6 being predominantly that of excluded volume.
This can be attributed to the high packing density of Dextran 6 (arising
from it having the least molecular weight among the crowders used
in this study), wherein at high concentrations of this crowder, the
work done in creating a cavity to house the serum protein is presumably
more. Furthermore, the observed switch in the nature of transitions
depending on the domain I–II or domain II–III face supports
the fact that these two faces of HSA exude different extents of hydrophobic
potentials, that is, HSA presents an asymmetric structure disposition.
This also points to the fact that the serum protein, with its vast
array of amino acids, can direct the arrangement of crowders around
itself depending upon the nature of the latter. Moreover, the deviation
of the domain separation as observed in the mixtures, from that expected
in the case of a strictly ideal solution, is a strong evidence of
the nature of entanglement and hence the complexity of the crowded
milieu.

To put these results into perspective with regard to
the structure
of the serum protein, it is known that the binding of FAs to HSA invokes
significant conformational changes that involve large-scale domain
movements.42,50,51 Binding of myristate (there are six binding sites of myristate on
HSA), a long chain FA, brings about relative rotations of the three
domains with these domains themselves undergoing only a modest distortion.
For example, domains I and III are displaced to the left, thereby
opening the central crevice and increasing the width of the protein,
with the latter serving as a possible discriminatory gate for further
entry of drugs that are known to bind to the subdomain cavities of
HSA. Myristate binding to subdomain IIIA of HSA replaces the interaction
in the domain interface between Glu 450 (of subdomain IIIA) and Arg
348 (of subdomain IIB) which have minimal effect on the local structure
of the multidomain protein.50,51 Moreover, FAs also
affect binding of ligands such as heme to HSA through an allosteric
mechanism that includes subtle movement of several amino acids. Few
other studies show that because of the rotation of the domain interfaces
of I and III, substantial conformational changes occur in HSA which
significantly affect the FA binding in that specific domain of HSA.42,43,50 Thus, as evident, domain movements
play a critical role in the function of the serum protein. Keeping
in mind the fact that crowders (whether individual or mixed) affect
the relative domain distances considerably, it is thus logical to
expect that the same will be modulated extensively in the crowded
milieu, with the mixed crowding scenario providing us a closer mimic
of the physiological interior.

Diffusion in the crowded medium
is hindered80 and has often been considered
to be anomalous.81,82 Anomalous diffusion of the subdiffusive
type is generally represented
by the value of α < 1, where α is the diffusion exponent
that characterizes the dependence of the mean-squared displacement
of the fluorescent reporter on time (t). Using FCS,
it was shown that the value of the exponent deviated progressively
from 1 as the crowder concentration was increased. Another FCS study
reported that the microviscosity of Ficoll 70 and not bulk viscosity
was the prime factor in enhancing actin polymerization.83 While the aspect of diffusion in the presence
of crowders being anomalous is still a matter of debate,84 the heterogeneity of the crowded milieu has
generally been accepted. Thus, the fact that our FCS studies showed
that the microviscosities of the mixed crowders and those of the individual
components can be quite different not only provides a peek into the
underlying heterogeneity of mixed crowding but also gives us a hint
as to what the possible factors are that might affect the extent of
deviations from the ideality that we have reported in this work. One
such factor that stands out is the size of the crowders. Because the
deviation is most for the mixtures of the higher molecular weight
crowders (e.g., “Dextran 70 + Ficoll 70” mixture), we
propose that this arises from extensive interpolymer entanglement
of the long chains of the individual crowder molecules. Moreover,
the rapid drops in nonideality observed in such cases can be attributed
to a type of phase separation or depletion interactions, wherein a
higher number of molecules of the same crowder prefer to stay together.
Indeed, to get a more comprehensive understanding, such mixtures need
to be extensively studied using various approaches. One possible approach
would be to have a labeled crowder molecule, such as FITC-labeled
Dextran85 or FITC-labeled Ficoll or labeled
PEG serve, as the tracer molecule for FCS experiments and studies
involving single particle tracking, with the latter having been shown
to provide a better picture of the crowded milieu. A recent paper
has revealed how the crowder molecule PEG 10000 labeled with a FRET
pair undergoes changes in efficiency arising from modulations in the
distance between the donor–acceptor pair in the presence of
different crowders and also under intracellular conditions.86 Using a similar ploy for different crowder molecules
will also provide us much needed insights into the mixed crowding
scenario that we have dealt with in this paper.86

Finally, we would like to make an attempt to correlate
the observations
that we have obtained from the two different approaches, one being
the domain movement using FRET and the other being the translational
diffusion through FCS. Though the two approaches used in this study
are different in their own respects, in both the cases, significant
deviations from ideality were observed, particularly for the mixtures
of the larger crowders. The length-scale over which the domain motion
of HSA occurs and gets modulated is of the order of a few angstroms
and hence focuses more on the microscopic arrangement of the crowders
in the immediate proximity of the serum protein. On the other hand,
the translation motion involves much larger distances, typically in
the range of nanometers and hence can be considered to be more macroscopic
relative to the former. This implies that the observed heterogeneity
and deviation from simple additivity exists at several lengthscales
in such mixtures of macromolecular crowders and is in agreement with
previous reports.36

To conclude,
we have studied the effect of mixed macromolecular
crowding agents from two different aspects, namely, the domain movement
of the serum protein HSA and the translational diffusion of FITC.
The choice of HSA as the test protein was dictated not only by the
fact that it has been one of most well-studied proteins with respect
to small molecules and FA binding but also by the fact that such noncovalent
associations often induce appreciable angular displacements in the
serum protein.87,88 Moreover, previous reports have
shown that macromolecular crowding agents have an appreciable influence
on the domain movements of HSA.46,47 Our data show that
for both the cases, the effect of mixed macromolecular crowding is
nonadditive, that is, it deviates from that of the sum of the individual
components of the respective mixtures. This observation is important
because it occurs in spite of the fact that the effects of the mixed
crowders on the charged protein HSA and the minimally perturbing fluorescent
tracer molecule have been shown to be quite different. The enhanced
cooperativity in the domain separation in the presence of the mixed
crowders also suggests that the observed increase in refolding kinetics
and decrease in competing aggregation pathways of previous studies33,37 might be a direct outcome of such a phenomenon.

Experimental
Details
Materials and Method
Essentially, FA-free HSA, FITC,
and all the macromolecular crowding agents [Ficoll 70, Dextran 70,
Dextran 40, Dextran 6, and polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8)] were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. (USA) and used as
received without purification. Sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous
(Na2HPO4), sodium phosphate monobasic anhydrous
(NaH2PO4), and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and bicarbonate (NaHCO3) were purchased
from Merck Specialities Pvt, Ltd. (Mumbai) and used as received. Acrylodan
was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Invitrogen, USA), and NPA
was obtained from Clearsynth Labs (France). Keeping the overall crowder
concentration fixed at 200 g/L, all different binary combinations
of individual crowders were prepared, each at the 25 g/L interval.
For example, for the “Dextran 6 + Dextran 40” mixture,
these two crowders were mixed in the following ratios: 0:200, 25:175,
50:150, 75:125, 100:100, 125:75, 150:50, 175:25, and 200:0 in pH 7.4
phosphate buffer, with the concentrations expressed in grams per liter.
Here, for example, 0:200 represents 0 g/L of Dextran 6 and 200 g/L
of Dexran 40. Likewise, 75:125 implies 75 g/L of Dextran 6 and 125
g/L of Dexran 40.

Cys-34 and Tyr-411 of HSA were covalently
modified using acrylodan and NPA as discussed elsewhere.46,47 Absorption measurements were performed in a double-beam Shimadzu
UV–vis Spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Japan) using 1 cm path length
cuvettes. Absorbance values of the protein solutions were measured
in the range of 200–600 nm, and molar extinction coefficient
values used were as follows: ε277 = 36 500
M–1 cm–1 for HSA, ε365 = 21 000 for acrylodan (Ac), and ε365 = 20 000 M–1 cm–1 for
NPA (4-nitrophenyl anthranilate).88

Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out on an Edinburgh
Instruments (UK) fluorescence spectrometer (model: FLS920). The fluorescence
spectra of protein samples at different pH buffer solutions in the
presence and in the absence of crowders were measured using fluorescence
quartz cuvettes. Prior to each experiment, the concentration of every
sample was measured using the UV spectrophotometer (model UV-2450,
Shimadzu). The fluorescence spectra of the protein samples were recorded
at 25 °C, with the temperature being maintained by a Peltier-based
controller, and the protein concentration was maintained at 8 μM
for all the experiments. The samples were allowed an equilibration
time of 12 h (at 4 °C) before acquiring their respective spectra.
Samples containing unlabeled HSA were excited at 295 nm, and emission
was collected from 310 to 550 nm in 1 nm increments with an integration
time of 0.5 s, using a band pass of 4 nm in both the excitation and
emission arms of the instrument. To obtain information about domains
I and III, acrylodan-labeled HSA (Ac-HSA) and NPA-labeled HSA (NPA-HSA)
samples were excited at 365 nm, with emission collected from 380 to
600 nm in 1 nm increments using an integration time of 0.5 s and a
band pass of 2 nm in both the excitation and emission arms of the
instrument.

For FCS experiments, sodium carbonate–bicarbonate
buffer
(50 mM) of pH = 9.4 was prepared by dissolving weighed amounts of
sodium carbonate and bicarbonate in Millipore water (Elix 3 UV; Millipore,
Molsheim, France). pH of the buffer was maintained using a pH meter
(Hanna HI 3220). The solutions of macromolecular crowding agents were
prepared by dissolving the crowding agents in sodium carbonate–bicarbonate
buffer after weighing out the appropriate amounts using a Precisa
XB 120A (Sweden) analytical balance to get the desired concentration.

FRET Analysis
Trp–acrylodan and Trp–NPA
moieties form an efficient FRET pair and hence allow one to calculate
the distance between the two domains of the protein in response to
any perturbation (with Trp being in domain II and acrylodan in domain
I and NPA in domain III).47 The efficiency
of the energy transfer (E) as a function of distance
(r) between two probes can be expressed as follows 3  where R0 (Förster
radius) represents the distance at which energy transfer is 50% efficient, IDA is the intensity of the donor in the presence
of the acceptor, and ID is the unquenched
donor intensity (i.e., in the absence of the acceptor). The value
of R0 (in Å) can be obtained from
the equation below 4  where J(λ) is the overlap
integral, n is the refractive index of the medium,
and κ2 is the orientation factor between the donor
and acceptor electronic transition dipole moments. For our study,
we have calculated the energy transfer efficiency from the area under
the curve of the Trp emission from the labeled and unlabeled proteins.

The value of R0 for the native protein
was first calculated in the phosphate buffer and was determined to
be ∼28 and ∼23 Å (using the donor quantum yield
of 0.14, a J(λ) value of 1.18 × 1014 nm4 M–1 cm–1 for Ac HSA and 8.18 × 1013 nm4 M–1 cm–1 for NPA HSA and with κ2 set to 2/3 and n set to 1.34) for Ac HSA
and NPA-HSA, respectively. To make sure that the observed changes
in FRET efficiencies were not due to any abrupt modulations in R0 of the donor acceptor pairs, the R0 and J(λ) were also calculated
using MATLAB R2013B software for every crowder mixture. Because the
labeling efficiency was not 100%, all FRET data (Eobs) included were corrected for the acceptor stoichiometry.
The corrected efficiency (Ecor) is given
as Ecor = Eobs/fa, where fa is the fraction of the assembly with the acceptor. For simplicity,
we have stated the Ecor as E for all the calculations.89,90

Thermodynamic Analyses
Depending on the nature of the
transition, the distance change “r”
during the movement of domains was fit either to a two-state or a
three-state model.91−93 On the basis of this method, we have assumed that
the standard free energy of unfolding ΔG1→20 is a
linear function of the concentration of the crowder being varied in
the binary mixture (eq 5). Closer analysis of Figure 2 suggests that for any crowder at a very high concentration
(∼150 g/L), there is almost no change in interdomain separation
for both the domains. From this observation, we have assumed that
for mixed crowding at very high concentrations of any of the component
of the binary mixture, the domain motion attains a near saturation,
akin to folded and unfolded baselines as used in the denaturation
studies of proteins. 5  where ΔG1→20(H2O) is the free energy change
for the domain movement in the
absence of crowder 2, and mG, the slope, is a measure of the dependence of the change in
free energy on the crowder Mc. In the following two-state
equilibrium, M1 ⇋ M2, M represents the
conformational states of the protein in the pure macromolecular crowders,
and the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the individual crowder components
of the binary mixture. It should be noted that in eq 3, Mc is that crowder
whose concentration is being varied in the mixture. For example, in
the mixture of Dextran 6 and Dextran 40, because the concentration
of Dextran 6 is being varied, the Mc refers to the concentration
of Dextran 6.

The FRET-based interdomain distance during the
domain movement can be expressed in the following manner 6  where r is the measured interdomain
distance, r1 and r2 are the distances between the domains of the protein in the
crowders M1 and M2, respectively, and X1 and X2 stand for
the mole fractions of these states, respectively. Both r1 and r2 were assumed to depend
linearly upon the concentration of the varied crowder [Mc] in g/L 7  

Mole fractions (X1, X2) are related to the equilibrium
constant by 8  

Considering the fact that
the standard free energy change and the
equilibrium constant for the two-state process is given by 9  combining eqs 5–9, one can express the
observed interdomain distance r by 10  where R is
the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The two-state transitions
were fit to eq 7 and
from the nonlinear least squares analysis providing the best fits
to the data, the values of ΔG1→20(H2O) and mG were obtained.

In some
cases, a three-state model for unfolding had to be used
for a more proper analysis of mixed crowding-induced domain movement
profiles for HSA. The equilibrium can be written as 11  where
M1 and M2 have
their meanings as described above, with “MIn”
being the intermediate that gets populated at equilibrium. The MI ⇋ MIn and MIn ⇋ M2 equilibria are characterized by the equilibrium constants  and  and the free energy changes, ΔGIn→10 and ΔG2→In0, respectively.

For the three-state
model, r is given by the following
equation91 12  where Z1 is a
parameter that measures the optical characteristics (in this case,
the interdomain distance) of the intermediate MI in relation
to that of M1 and M2 and is given by 13  where rI is the
interdomain distance in the intermediate MIn, and r1 and r2 have the
usual meaning as mentioned above. 14  

It has been assumed that the
free energies of the domain movement
of M1 and M2 both show a linear dependence on
the crowder concentration.

Here, we would like to point out
the essence of the x-axis, for the plots in Figure 2. In the mixtures
containing Dextran 6 and another
crowder, the concentration of Dextran 6 has been varied along the x-axis. For example, in the “Dextran 6 + Ficoll 70”
mixture, the “zero” reading of the x-axis corresponds to 0 g/L of Dextran 6 and 200 g/L of Ficoll 70.
Similarly for the “Dextran 40 + Dextran 70” and “Dextran
40 + Ficoll 70” mixtures, the Dextran 40 concentration has
been varied along the x-axis, whereas for “Dextran
70 + Ficoll 70”, the concentration of Dextran 70 has been varied.
For better insights, we have also plotted a comparison of Δr, where one of these, Δrmc, is obtained directly from the mixed crowding data as follows 15  where mc stands for mixed
crowding, rmc is the interdomain distance
in the mixed
crowding environment, and r0 is the corresponding
interdomain distance of HSA in buffer only, that is, in the absence
of any crowding agent. The other one, more specifically ΣΔr, is the summation obtained from the individual crowders
as follows 16  where Δr has
the same
meaning as in eq 15,
with mc replaced by either C1(X) or C2(200 – X), with C1(X) representing “X” g/L of crowder
1 and C2(200 – X) representing “200 – X” g/L
of the second crowder (crowder 2) in the binary mixture. For example,
in the “Dextran 6 + Dextran 40” mixture, ΣΔr at 50 g/L of Dextran 6 corresponds to the sum of Δr values obtained at 50 g/L Dextran 6 and 150 g/L Dextran
40. The comparison of the Δr trends has been
provided in Figures 3–5 (and Supporting Information Figures S1–S4).

Fluorescence Correlation
Spectroscopy
FCS measurements
were carried out using a custom-built confocal setup based on an inverted
microscope (Olympus) platform, equipped with a water immersion objective
(NA = 1.2, 60×). The tracer dye, FITC, in different media (with
and without crowders) was excited with the 488 nm line of a CW argon-ion
laser (Modu-Laser, model: Stellar Pro. Select), with the light being
guided onto the dichroic from the laser using a single-mode fiber.
The fluorescence from the samples was collected with the same objective
and focussed onto an avalanche photodiode (model: SPCM-AQRH-14, Canada)
fitted with a 50 μm confocal pinhole. Fluorescent bursts from
the molecules diffusing through the confocal volume were collected,
and the photons were correlated in the auto-correlation mode using
a FLEX correlator card (Flex02-01D/C), Correlator.com, USA). The
FCS traces so obtained were analyzed according to the following model92 17  where N is the average number
of molecules in the confocal volume, τD is the diffusion
time of the tracer molecule, ω is the ratio between radial and
length of the confocal volume, τtriplet is the triplet
lifetime of the fluorophore, and T is the corresponding
triplet amplitude.
