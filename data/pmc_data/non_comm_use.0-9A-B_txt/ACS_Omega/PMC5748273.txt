The recombinant HbI
was fused with a poly-Lys tag ((Lys)6-tagged rHbI) for
specific-site covalent immobilization on two carbon
nanotube transducer surfaces, i.e., powder and vertically aligned
carbon nanotubes. The immobilization was achieved by following two
steps: (1) generation of amine-reactive ester from the carboxylic
acid groups of the surfaces and (2) coupling these groups with the
amine groups of the Lys-tag. We analyzed the immobilization process
using different conditions and techniques to differentiate protein
covalent attachment from physical adsorption. Fourier transform infrared
microspectroscopy data showed a 14 cm–1 displacement
of the protein’s amide I and amide II peaks to lower the frequency
after immobilization. This result indicates a covalent attachment
of the protein to the surface. Differences in the morphology of the
carbon substrate with and without (Lys)6-tagged rHbI confirmed
protein immobilization, as observed by transmission electron microscopy.
The electrochemical studies, which were performed to evaluate the
redox center of the immobilized protein, show a confinement suitable
for an efficient electron transfer system. More importantly, the electrochemical
studies allowed determination of a redox potential for the new (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. The data show that the protein is electrochemically
active and retains its biological activity toward H2S.

1 Introduction
The
immobilization of proteins on different surfaces has been an
extremely active field of study in which a great variety of strategies
have been described for further applications. For the immobilization
of proteins onto supports, several factors need to be considered depending
on the application, including the assembly of biomaterials, the strength
of the immobilization, the influence of the surface electrode in the
final assembly, and more importantly, the retention of the biomaterial
properties after the process. Therefore, the type of immobilization
(covalent or noncovalent), as well as the control of a homogeneous
orientation of the protein, becomes increasingly important.1

Recent studies explore the use of endogenous
functional groups
present in the side chains of the amino acids to immobilize proteins
at different surfaces by covalent bonds.1 However, due to multiple copies of the same amino acids in a protein,
random orientations of the protein are possible. Fusing the proteins
with a tag added at the C or N terminus can overcome the random orientation,2−4 and moreover it can contribute to the purification process.5,6

Another technique for the immobilization of proteins is the
use
of fusion proteins with an extension of charged amino acids, such
as polyarginine,6,7 polyhistidine,2,8−10 polyaspartic, and polylysine10,11 tails. The polyhistidine tail (His-tag) is the most commonly used
method to purify and immobilize proteins on numerous surfaces9 but through a noncovalent, reversible immobilization.
On the other hand, tags of repeated polar amino acids, such as aspartic
acid, lysine, and arginine, are suitable for covalent immobilization.
For example, Allard et al.10 and Ladavière
et al.11 successfully immobilized a polylysine
tagged protein by a covalent bond. Our recombinant hemoglobin I (HbI)
from Lucina pectinata was engineered
to contain a polylysine tag,12 which allowed
it to attach covalently on conductive and biocompatible multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This will be a viable approach to further
develop a prototype detection system for hydrogen sulfide because
HbI binds H2S with high affinity.13,14 For this future application, it is imperative to determine if the
protein is electrochemically and biologically active after immobilization
and to prove the capability of an electron transfer process between
the protein and the electrode.15,16

The overall goal
of this work is to immobilize a Lys tag recombinant
HbI on a conductive surface via the formation of covalent bonds with
the retention of the protein’s biological properties. We previously
reported the construction, expression, and purification of this new
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI together with its structural and functional
properties.12 The results showed that the
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI is structurally analogous to the native
HbI and to the (His)6-tagged rHbI protein that binds H2S. In addition, the results indicated that the lysine residues
located in the tag are more solvent exposed (>60%) than the other
three native lysine residues (<60%). Thus, the polylysine tag is
most likely responsible for the interaction between the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI and biocompatible surfaces. Indeed, the results
show that the Lys6-tag offers an alternative for the proper
immobilization of the protein on reactive surfaces due to the high
abundance of lysine residues exposed to the solvent in the C-terminal.11,12,17 In general, these residues are
certainly suitable to anchor the protein on different surfaces. For
example, using a coupling agent, the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI
was immobilized via an amide bond to the carbonyl-oxidized surfaces
of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) not only have an excellent
transfer rate due to their high reaction area and their ultrasmall
size, but they can be very useful materials to make electrodes.

Nanotubes have unique electrical properties that allow direct electron
transfer between the redox active center of the protein and the electrode,
which makes them suitable for this application. One disadvantage of
the CNTs is their chemical inertness and high hydrophobicity that
generally allows them to form insoluble aggregates. Many efforts have
led to the development of versatile chemical modification methodologies
for the surface functionalization of CNTs to solve the insolubility
and inertness problem. One of the most reported paths for functionalization
of CNTs is the formation of carboxylic acids groups (COOH) by the
oxidation of the CNTs with strong acids. Here, CNTs were oxidized
to create a series of defects on the carbon surfaces of carbonyl groups
to generate a reactive surface. For protein immobilization, both oxidized
multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs-COOH) and single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs-COOH)
have been demonstrated to immobilize many types of proteins. Although
SWCNTs are attractive because of their higher surface for proteins
interactions, MWCNTs are desirable for their easy dispersibility and
lower cost. Several techniques are used to immobilize proteins on
CNTs (using either MWCNTs or SWCNTs) ranging from reversible physical
adsorption to irreversible stable covalent bonds.18

Although in most cases, noncovalent19,20 absorption
immobilization preserves the protein’s and the CNTs’
chemical and physical properties, the major drawback of this approach
is the eventual leakage of the protein from the CNTs.21 In addition, in many occasions, the physical adsorption
of the proteins requires the use of other substances like polymers
and/or surfactants, which add complexity to the immobilization process.21 In contrast, covalent conjugation not only provides
a direct link between the protein and the CNTs, preventing the protein
to leak from the active surfaces, but it can also maintain the properties
of the protein. To covalently attach the protein on CNTs, surface
functionalization of CNTs is required.22 Among the various surface functionalization techniques, the most
studied are the amidation reaction of the oxidized carbon nanotubes.
Nonetheless, as explained by Fleming et al.,23 the individual protein molecules can adopt many different orientations
on an electrode. These aspects, as well as the difficulty for these
macro-biomolecules to achieve a direct electron exchange at any electrode
surface, are important features to evaluate. They usually have large
and complex structures, where the redox centers are deeply immersed
in the protein body. For this reaction, several coupling agents are
used to activate the surface of oxidized CNTs.

Our data demonstrate
that the (Lys)6-tag is suitable
to attach this new rHbI on transducer surfaces like MWCNTs.24 Important techniques like Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning
electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and
atomic force microscopy (AFM), as well as electrochemical analysis
were used to show that (Lys)6-tagged rHbI was immobilized
by covalent attachment to the carbonyl oxide surface of MWCNTs. Electrochemical
analysis also demonstrated protein activity after the immobilization
of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI at the oxidized vertically aligned
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (VACNTs-COOH) electrode. (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs response toward H2S was evaluated.
The results suggest the potential applicability of this electrode
to detect H2S.20

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Immobilization Reaction
of (Lys)6-Tagged rHbI at MWCNTs-COOH
UV–vis
studies and Bradford
assay showed that the immobilization reactions of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI at MWCNTs-COOH were successful. Bradford differential
analysis, as shown in Table 1, suggests that approximately 27% of the protein treated with
coupling agents (EDC and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS))
bound to the MWCNTs-COOH, whereas only less than 7% were bound to
the MWCNTs-COOH when the system was not treated with coupling agents.
This was established by monitoring the UV–vis concentration
of the protein remaining in the supernatant after immobilization process
and subtracted from the initial concentration of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI as explained in Section 4.1. As predicted, the solution containing
coupling agents bound more protein than the solution lacking coupling
agents.

Validating
the covalent conjugation of the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI onto the carboxylated MWCNTs using EDC/NHS required rigorous
scrutiny to differentiate a covalent immobilization from protein adsorption.
Therefore, we monitored the amide bands of the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI before and after immobilization. The FTIR spectra of the controls
((Lys)6-tagged rHbI without coupling agents and the (His)6-tagged rHbI with agents) and the oxidized MWCNTs without
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI were also evaluated. The first control,
corresponding to the immobilized (Lys)6-tagged rHbI without
the use of coupling agents, provides information of the contribution
or existence of noncovalent interaction, for example, irreversibly
bound intercalated, entrapped, or hydrophobically attached. It is
known that the coupling agents are necessary to promote the covalent
immobilization by forming amide linkage between primary amine groups
of the lysine tag and the COOH of the MWCNTs-COOH. Thus, the presence
of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI at the MWCNTs-COOH after several
washing cycles is caused by irreversible interactions different from
covalent attachment. The second control is (His)6-tagged
rHbI with EDC/NHS. It is known that the lateral chain of His6-tag is an imidazole group where its secondary amine is not capable
of forming an amide bond, whereas the primary amino groups of each
residue were already forming peptide bonds to rHbI. Then, this control
provides information of the possible immobilization of the protein
via amine groups of other lysines or residues at the surfaces of the
protein or other interactions.

It should be noted that IR microspectroscopy
is a quantitative
technique that can be used to determine the absolute protein concentration
given the thickness of the sample and using Beer’s Law.25 In this work, the absolute protein concentration
was not determined; however, the peak height (intensity) of the amide
I was used to establish a relative concentration and to monitor changes
after several washes. Figure 1 shows the amide bands of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI
after the immobilization and washing processes (black line) and the
controls (without EDC/NHS and the (His)6-tagged rHbI, blue
and red lines, respectively). As shown in Figure 1, the intensity of the amide bands of the
treated (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH are remarkably higher
than the controls, implying a higher concentration of the protein
on MWCNTs-COOH using the coupling agents EDC/NHS. When the immobilization
process was conducted without EDC and NHS, the amide I and amide II
bands decrease dramatically (∼69%) after various washes (blue
line). However, it is observed that the control with (His)6-tagged rHbI in the presence of EDC and NHS kept a noticeable, although
not strong, intensity of the amides bands. This control suggests a
strong interaction with the MWCNTs-COOH, which could be attributed
to the formation of covalent bonds with some of the exposed lysine
residue on the surface of the protein. In the absence of high density
of lysine in certain areas, like the tag, the immobilization onto
MWCNTs-COOH would take place at random on any of the three lysine
residues available on the surface.17 This
strongly supports the notion of a strong covalent bond between the
lysine tag of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI and the MWCNTs-COOH.

rHbI with (black) and without coupling agent (EDC/NHS) (red), centrifuged
and washed with water 18 times. (His)6-tagged rHbI immobilization

amide II region.

The (His)6-tagged rHbI has comparable structural and
functional properties to the native HbI and the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI.12 The main difference between these
two rHbI mutants is the histidine tag at the N-terminus instead of
a lysine tag at the C-terminus. This (His)6-tagged rHbI
has the same quantity of lysine residues, except for the presence
of the (Lys)6-tagged at the C-terminus. Thus, this strongly
suggests that the lysine residues within the tag are the reactive
species, and the other Lys residues in the protein do not contribute
to the covalent attachment of the protein. This is in accordance with
the results previously published by this group in which the (Lys)6-tag was used to interact electrostatically with a cation
exchange resin for purification purposes.12 There it was demonstrate that due to the high abundance of lysine
exposed to the solvent in the C-terminal (polylysine tag), it is reasonable
to suggest that these residues are more likely responsible for the
coupling reaction between the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI and the
activated carboxylic groups of the MWCNTs-COOH. Other authors that
use polylysine tag employed similar rationalization.11,17

Additionally, displacement of the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI
amide bands supports the covalent immobilization of the protein on
the MWCNTs-COOH. For example, Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of (a) (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI, (b) MWCNTs-COOH, and (c) (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH. Figure 2a shows the presence
of the vibrational normal mode of amide I at 1657 cm–1, whereas amide II appeared at 1548 cm–1. This
is in agreement with the expected amide I and II absorption bands
for proteins with predominantly α-helix structures, which are
usually found in the spectral range of 1652–1657 cm–1 and 1545–1551 cm–1, respectively.26 The FTIR spectrum of MWCNTs-COOH, Figure 2b, displayed a band at 1734
cm–1, which has been assigned to the C=O
stretch mode of carboxylic acid. The band at 1682 cm–1 has also been assigned to the stretch mode of traces of water. The
immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI to MWCNTs-COOH can
be demonstrated by the changes in the FTIR spectra of these species,
as observed in Figure 2c of the resulting (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH conjugation.
The disappearance of the band at 1734 cm–1, attributed
to the C=O bonds of MWCNTs-COOH, suggests that the carboxylic
groups of MWCNTs-COOH react almost completely with the amino groups
of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. The vibration of −NH3+ also appears in the spectrum of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH biocomposite, which indicates the
existence of native amine groups in the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH.
Moreover, the presence of the amide I and amide II bands, at 1643
and 1535 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH biocomposite after immobilization
reaction and several washes, indicates that the protein is strongly
attached to the MWCNTs-COOH.

Figure 2 FTIR microspectroscopy of the (a) (Lys)6-tagged rHbI,
(b) MWCNTs-COOH, and (c) (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH
biocomposite. The inset show a micrograph of the sample (circled white
star) (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH biocomposite region
and (black star) solvent region. All of the spectra represent an average
of two or more regions in the sample.

Interestingly, the spectra showed a displacement to lower
frequencies
in comparison to the same bands of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI
alone (Figure 2c,a,
respectively). This displacement supports the notion of a covalent
attachment (strong interactions) between the protein and the MWCNTs-COOH.
The adsorption frequency of the amide I and amide II bands provides
information about the secondary structure of the proteins. Slight
changes in the global structure of the protein should cause variations
in the length and directions of the hydrogen bonds that are part of
the amide bonds buried inside the protein. This promotes variations
in the strength of the hydrogen bonds between the secondary structures,
which results in the displacement of the amide I frequency. Thus,
the 14 cm–1 displacement of the amide I of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI toward lower frequencies after its conjugation
at the MWCNTs-COOH suggests changes in the global structure of the
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI. These changes are expected because
the protein was attached through its polylysine tag, causing the hydrogen
bond of the secondary structure to be slightly shorter (stronger),
displacing in turn the amide I to lower frequencies. Amide II vibration
equally shifts toward lower frequencies and shows a broadening, which
is related to the protein’s interactions with the solvent.
This is attributed to the presence of water, considering that then
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH biocomposite was more difficult
to dry out completely when preparing the samples for the FTIR analysis.

Similarly, TEM analyses were done to further support the immobilization
process. Figure 3a
shows the MWCNTs-COOH without the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI, whereas Figure 3b illustrates the
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH biocomposite system where
a spiderweb on the sidewalls of the MWCNTs can be easily observed.
In addition, there are differences in the diameters of the MWCNTs-COOH
with (15 ± 5 nm) and without the protein (10 ± 5 nm). The
former shows an increment in diameter attributed to the immobilization
of the protein at the MWCNTs-COOH sidewall. The fact this spiderweb
appears only in some regions of the MWCNTs-COOH surface supports the
suggestion of a covalent interaction, given that the protein is capable
of only binding to the oxidized part of the surface. As mentioned
in Section 4.1, the
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH biocomposite was rinsed
with deionized water several times with the intention of eliminating
any weak interactions (physical adsorption) between the MWCNTs-COOH
and the protein. Therefore, the only interactions that are expected
are strong covalent bonds between the oxidized part of MWCNTs-COOH
and the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. Because the oxidation on the
MWCNTs sidewalls is unevenly distributed, it is expected that the
conjugation of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI on the surface of
MWCNTs-COOH will also be uneven.27,28 Therefore,
it is not surprising that TEM images of the biocomposite are not equally
distributed or smooth in appearance. Nonetheless, the differences
in the morphology on the sidewall of MWCNTs-COOH with/without (Lys)6-tagged rHbI observed by TEM agree with the FTIR results,
which strongly support the argument that the protein is covalently
attached to the MWCNTs-COOH.

Figure 3 TEM images of MWCNTs-COOH (a) without (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI and (b) with (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. The arrow indicates
the typical feature of the attached (Lys)6-tagged rHbI.

Recently, some research groups
reported excellent results of hemeprotein
immobilization on multiwalled carbon nanotubes using a different strategy.29 They modified the MWCNTs-COOH surfaces with l-lysine by electrodeposition followed by a second step involving
the catalase immobilization onto the poly-l-lysine-MWCNTs.29 However, the present work is entirely different
because the polylysine tag was added to the C-terminal codons of a
recombinant hemoglobin I expression construct. Thus, this new (Lys)6-tagged rHbI was immobilized onto the functionalized MWCNTs-COOH
by EDC/NHS. The FTIR and TEM results demonstrated chemical attachment
instead of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs biocomposite protein
adsorption. Thus, this is an alternative that can be used to attach
a biocomponent.

2.2 Surface Analysis of (Lys)6-Tagged
rHbI/VACNTs-COOH Biocomposite
MWCNTs-COOH powder was first
used as a model to determine the effectiveness of the immobilization.
We then moved to an electrode of oxidized VACNTs-COOH, which also
have carbonyl sites where the protein can be attached, but the main
advantage of this electrode is that it is highly sensitive due to
the high surface area, which improves the detection limits and the
signal-to-noise ratio.30 We therefore used
the VACNTs-COOH electrode for SEM and electrochemical analyses. Figure 4a,b shows impressive
SEM images of VACNTs-COOH and (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH.
The images demonstrate that the VACNTs-COOH and the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH biocomposite have the appearance of bonfires.
The differences in the appearance of both bonfires are due to the
immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. Although this bundle
formation (Figure 4a) can be initially due to the exposure of the VACNTs-COOH to the
solution and the drying process (the drying meniscus forces will bend
the nanotubes into tufts), we suggest that the differences in Figure 4a,b are due to the
immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. As shown in Figure 4b, the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH electrode is wider on top and on
the base of the bonfire as compared to the VACNTs-COOH bunches (Figure 4a). Similarly, the
three-dimensional (3D) AFM images show a slight increase in height,
as well as width on the top and the base, of the bonfires arrangements.
These results are in accordance with the results obtained by the TEM
images (Figure 3b)
where it can be easily observed how the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI
attach to the MWCNTs-COOH sidewall, causing an increment in its thickness.
The height differences can be assessed by the increment in the root
mean square roughness (Rq), which varies from 963 to 1168 nm, whereas
the width increases from 457 ± 60 to 781 ± 101 nm. This
represents an increment of approximately 58%, similar to the one observed
with TEM analysis of modified and unmodified MWCNTs-COOH. EDS spectra
corroborate the presence of the protein, taking into consideration
the absence of nitrogen in the bare VACNTs-COOH versus the presence
of nitrogen (1–2 atom %) when the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI was immobilized on the surface of VACNTs. Overall, the SEM and
AFM results demonstrated that the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI was
successfully attached to the new VACNTs-COOH electrode.

2.3 Electrochemical
Characterization of the (Lys)6-Tagged rHbI/Carbon Substrate
Biocomposite and the Interaction
with H2S
To further evaluate the covalent immobilization
of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI on the oxidized VACNTs electrode
and the electrochemical response of this biocomposite, cyclic (CV)
and square-wave voltammetry (SWV) were employed.

2.3.1 Immobilization
of the (Lys)6-Tagged
rHbI at VACNTs-COOH by CV
The measurement of the electrochemical
response of the electrode to K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 by CV is a valuable tool for validating
the immobilization on the VACNTs. For example, an increase in the
current implies an efficient electron transfer process between the
electroactive species in the solution and the electrode surface, whereas
a decrease in the current indicates that there are molecules attached
on the electrode surface that reduce to some extent the electron transfer
process. Changes in the capacitance while keeping the same surface
with the same dielectric constant also provide information about the
area, in this case, about the electrode surface area. Consequently,
a decrease in the capacitance implies a decrease in the surface area
of the VACNTs-COOH due to the blocking effects of the molecules modifying
the surfaces of the nanotubes. A high capacitance indicates a large
surface area, which is the characteristic of oxidized empty VACNTs.31,32

Figure 5 shows
the CV of VACNTs-COOH before (solid black) and after (dashed red)
the immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI in the presence
of 1.0 mM K3Fe(CN)6. The CV of the VACNTs-COOH
shows a large background current due to the double-layer capacitance
of this porous material, which allows the solution to access the interior
of the electrode. Oxidized VACNTs form a highly permeable porous film,
creating a large accessible surface area in which the electrolytes
can easily penetrate. Therefore, the large capacitance current observed
in the CV of the empty VACNTs-COOH results from accessibility of the
K3Fe(CN)6 electrolyte solution to the surface
of the VACNTs-COOH. In contrast, as shown in Figure 5, a decrease in the non-Faradaic current
after immobilization of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI is observed.
This decrease in the capacitance is attributed to the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI being on the VACNTs-COOH surface or between them, diminishing
the access of the electrolyte solution to the interior of the VACNTs-COOH
film.33 In others words, the immobilized
protein at the sidewall and/or top of the VACNTs-COOH decreases its
surface area, reducing to some extent the accessibility of the K3Fe(CN)6 solution. In conclusion, the decrease in
capacitance after protein immobilization suggests that the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI not only attaches to the VACNTs-COOH but also
allows the transfer of electrons to the electrode. To prove this suggestion,
we use the square-wave voltammetry (SWV), which is the most appropriate
technique to overcome the larger double charging in the VACNTs-COOH
due to the Faradaic current because it suppressed the non-Faradaic
background currents much more effectively than CV. SWV measures the
Faradaic current at a suitable time after the potential pulse occurs
in which the non-Faradaic current decays to the point of becoming
negligible.34

black) and after (dashed red) the immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI in the presence of 1.0 mM K3Fe(CN)6 (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0), with a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

2.3.2 Characterization
of the (Lys)6-Tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH by Square-Wave Voltammetry
(SWV)
SWV is a powerful technique for electroanalysis with
the advantages
of speed and very low detection limits.35−37 SWV is widely known
for its better signal-to-noise ratio and resolution when compared
to CV due to the minimization of current capacity. It allows one to
effectively discriminate non-Faradaic current from Faradaic current,38,39 which enables very low detection limits. Faradaic current yields
information about the electrochemical behavior of the oxidized VACNTs
with and without (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. Figure 6a shows the SWV for the VACNTs-COOH before
and after the immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. There
is a remarkable displacement toward more negative potentials and a
decrease in current upon conjugation with the protein. This shift
in the peak potential (Ep) from 0.029
V (solid black line, empty VACNTs-COOH) to Ep at −0.170 V (dashed red line) after immobilization
implies that the protein is indeed attached to the VACNTs-COOH. Therefore,
this Ep at −0.170 V represents
the redox potential of the protein. This was confirmed by analyzing
the forward (oxidation) and reverse (reduction) process.

square-wave voltammetry for (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH
(dashed red) and VACNTs-COOH alone (solid
black) in pH 6 buffer. (b) Forward (dashed red) and reverse (dashed
black) current square-wave voltammograms for (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI/VACNTs-COOH in pH 6.0 buffer solutions. The inset shows the net
current.

Figure 6b shows
the forward (dashed red) and reverse (dashed black) scan of SWV for
the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH at pH 6.0. The data
clearly suggest that the redox process is reversible. To determine
the net current, we subtracted the forward from the reverse process,
which is shown in the inset. The observation that the net current
is positive confirms that the redox process is reversible.40 In both cases, the forward and reverse peaks
were broad, suggesting an heterogeneous VACNTs-COOH surface, which
is in accordance with the SEM and AFM data. As shown in the inset
of Figure 6b, a large
net current is produced because the forward and reverse currents contribute
almost equally to it. A similar phenomenon is seen in films with reversible
electron transfer that have restricted internal diffuse mass transport.40

It also important to note the broad SWV
exhibited by the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH biocomposite
in Figure 6b. Numerous
aspects can contribute
to the broadening of the SWV peak, which suggests possible thermodynamic
or kinetic dispersions.41 Some of the reasons
for this behavior can be attributed to the repulsion between immobilized
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI, differences in the spatial distribution
of its redox centers, and dispersion of peak potentials (Ep). In this case, the repulsion between the immobilized
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI is attributed to the protein distribution
and its volume, whereas the dispersion of peak potentials is related
to its redox center (mixture of Fe(III)/Fe(II)). This (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH biocomposite behaves similar to those models
of confined redox molecules, such as Cytochrome c oxidase, which strongly adsorbs in a stable functional state at
near-monolayer coverage on carboxylic acid terminated self-assembled
monolayer.42 Thus, SWV not only showed
that (Lys)6-tagged rHbI is electrochemically active but
that it also exhibited a remarkable displacement in the Ep that clearly distinguished the VACNTs-COOH alone from
the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH electrode (Figure 6a,b). The average Ep (n = 6) was (−0.18
± 0.04) V for (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH electrode
compared to VACNTs-COOH without protein that under the same conditions
exhibited an average Ep of (0.039 ±
0.005) V vs Ag/AgCl. The Ip has a higher
standard deviation Ip = (407 ± 99)
μA, which is not surprising considering that the nonhomogeneous
surface of CNTs does not necessarily generate a uniform protein distribution
as explained in Section 2.2. Because TEM images indicate that MWCNTs are not modified
evenly, we can assume an uneven modification in the VACNTs as well.
Thus, there will be slight differences between the modified electrodes
that affect the Ip and Ep measurements.

2.3.3 Electrochemical
Response toward H2S
To evaluate the activity of
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI
immobilized on VACNTs-COOH, the SWV of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH
biocomposite in the presence of different concentrations of H2S was analyzed. This study helps to provide information about
the protein function retention after immobilization. The electrochemical
behavior of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI toward H2S was
evaluated at pH 6.0. H2S is a weak acid with a first pKa value between 6.97 and 7.06 at 25 °C.
This is very important to control because according the Le Chatellier’s
Principle, at this pH, the equilibrium will continually shift to the
left, generating H2S(aq). 1  It is well established that at pH
= 7.4, the
ratio is ∼30% as H2S(aq) and 70% HS–(aq).43,44 Thus, at pH 6, the (Lys)6-tag
rHbI Fe(III)–H2O complex was present and, after
addition of H2S, the following equilibrium is suggested. 2  Before adding H2S, several scans
were conducted to assure the electrochemical oxidation of Lys-tag
rHbI Fe(II) to (Lys)6-tag rHbI Fe(III). The strategy was
to monitor the current until no changes were observed, which confirmed
that all of the protein was in the Lys6-tag rHbI Fe(III)
oxidation state. Before the successive scanning from −0.400
to 0.400 V, the potential was held at −0.400 V for 60 s. During
this holding period, H2S was added. After the addition
of H2S, formation of the Fe(III)–H2S
derivative (see reaction 2) is expected, considering the large association rate constant 1.4
× 105 M–1 s–1 for
the formation of the (Lys)6 rHbI Fe(III)–H2S at neutral pH.12

Figure 7 shows the electrochemical
response of the (Lys)6-tag rHbI/VACNTs in three replicate
electrodes after the addition of H2S. As shown in Figure 7, small changes in
the (Lys)6 rHbI Fe(II)/(III) oxidation peak current of
(Lys)6-tag rHbI/VACNTs-COOH were observed upon H2S addition. For each electrode and before any H2S addition,
a forward scan was done to determine the Ep. Then, for each subsequent H2S addition, changes in the
current peak (Ip) were monitored. As previously
discussed, several reasons are responsible of the variation in Ep, but on average, we report an Ep of (−0.18 ± 0.04) V. Although the objective
of the work presented here is to show that the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI/MWCNTs biocomposite is a robust electrode construction and an
electrochemically active system capable of binding a heme ligand,
using hydrogen sulfide as an example, the present bioelectrode serves
as a proof of concept, capable of binding and detecting H2S. Although the system is not optimized as a quantitative sensor
for hydrogen sulfide, we chose the best linear fit to report preliminary
analytical results for the determination of H2S. The oxidation
peak current of H2S was found to be proportional to H2S concentrations over the range of 33.2 to ∼158.5 μM,
as shown in Figure S1, with an average
limit of detection of 33 μM. This value is higher than the values
reported by other research groups for the detection of H2S at the surface of modified enzyme-based electrodes which is approximately
0.3 μM,45 but in our case, we did
not test the composite with H2S concentrations below 33.2
μM. The observed affinity toward H2S and consequently
the biosensor’s detection limit will depend on the protein
density on the surface of the CNTs, the surface area, as well the
volume/concentration of the sample employed. All of these parameters
must be optimized to lower the limit of detection and improve the
sensing properties of our system. One of the most important advantages
of the system is the inherent high affinity (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI toward H2S.12 Notice that
this composite will not be possible using myoglobin because this species
in the presence of H2S and oxygen produces sulfmyoglobin.46−48 Another advantage of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs system
is that it could be used to explore the relationship between chemical
structure, reactivity, and function of rHbI, as a model of heme proteins,
with ligands such as CN, NO, CO, and O2 using direct electrochemical
and spectroscopic techniques to measure the oxidation/reduction properties
of the heme active center.

Figure 7 Electrochemical responses of three different
electrodes of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH to the addition
of H2S.
For each one of these prototype electrodes, the changes in the current
peak at Ep were monitored after each H2S addition.

The reproducibility of
the electrodes does not come from the rHbI
immobilization process, which is robust, but instead it is inherent
to (1) the auto-oxidation/reduction process of the heme group in rHbI,
(2) the nature of the ligand and its dependence on pH, and (3) in
the environment and structure of electrode array based on the vertical
aligned carbon nanotubes. In the protein and ligand scenarios, several
oxidation scans at pH = 6 were conducted to assure the electrochemical
oxidation of (Lys)6-tag rHbI Fe(II) and to maximize the
concentration of the active (Lys)6 rHbI Fe(III) derivatives,
which efficiently bind the H2S ligand.

In all of
the cases, the oxidation peak current for the (Lys)6 rHbI/VACNTs-COOH
increases with an increase in H2S concentration. This suggests
that as soon as Fe(II) is oxidized
to Fe(III) in an H2S environment, the formation of (Lys)6-tag rHbI Fe(III)–H2S is promoted, generating
an increase in current. With each addition of H2S, less
(Lys)6-tag rHbI molecules are available to form (Lys)6-tag rHbI Fe(III)–H2S, and a plateau is
finally reached. As shown in Figure 7, changes in the (Lys)6-tag rHbI oxidation
peak current of the (Lys)6-tag rHbI/VACNTs were observed
initially until a plateau was reached. In general, the observed increased
in current is attributed to a change in HbI environment, indicating
that reaction 2 is taking
place. Once the reaction is completed, the HbI binding sites are occupied
by H2S, the reaction reached an equilibrium and a plateau
is observed. Its possible to observe that at low concentrations, the
current is directly proportional to the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH
concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations (greater than 150.0
μM), where the number of vacancies (Fe(III)) on the (Lys)6-tag rHbI/VACNTs will be limited, the current begins to reach
a plateau. This observed behavior of the interaction, chemisorption
of H2S at Fe(III)-(Lys)6-tag rHbI/VACNTs looks
like a Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm,49−51 where Fe(III)-(Lys)6-tag rHbI/VACNTs would represent the adsorbent, whereas H2S would be like an adsorbate. Because the data fit very well
for both sorption isotherms, we do not consider the random sequential
adsorption52 model in this analogy. However,
the authors understand that an additional analysis is necessary before
establishing a model and to avoid a misleading approach.53

Overall, all of the replicate electrodes
showed changes in current
and a small displacement toward more positive potentials (30–40
mV) with each H2S addition. This suggests that the electronic
transfer between the protein and electrode is slower. Moreover, we
observed that the coverage does not affect the Ep. The results not only showed the electrochemical response
of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs-COOH and toward H2S, but it also demonstrates that the behavior is reproducible.

3 Conclusions
The results demonstrated
that the Lys tag interacts strongly with
the MWCNTs-COOH as well as with VACNTs-COOH. This suggests that the
tag can also be used to covalently anchor the protein on conductive
supports like VACNTs-COOH arrays for a potential diverse application
including a future development of a bioelectrode for H2S detection. Overall, the results established that the location of
the poly-Lys tag facilitates the site-selective and covalent immobilization
of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. We propose that amidation between
the carboxylic groups of MWCNTs-COOH and the amine groups of the lateral
chain of the lysine tag was successfully achieved. Declaring this
type of conjugation results is difficult when it is known that CNTs
have a natural affinity for diverse proteins through hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions. However, some considerations were taken
to differentiate between covalent attachments and protein adsorption.
First, the immobilization reaction was performed in two steps, where
an amine reactive NHS ester was promoted by the addition of coupling
agents and then the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI was added. Second,
the resulted (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/MWCNTs biocomposite was
washed several times with deionized water to remove noncovalent adsorbed
(Lys)6-tagged rHbI. The FTIR, TEM, SEM, and electrochemical
analysis support this suggestion. For example, FTIR microspectroscopy
results showed a displacement in the peaks corresponding to amide
I and amide II, 1657 and 1548 cm–1, respectively,
toward 1643 and 1535 cm–1, when the hemeprotein
was immobilized on the oxidized MWCNTs surface. Differences in morphology
on the sidewall of MWCNTs before and after (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI were observed by TEM, SEM, and AFM, supporting the FTIR findings.
The electrochemical (CV and SWV) studies showed the clear evidence
of the presence of immobilized (Lys)6-tagged rHbI at VACNTs.

The (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs showed good electrochemical
activity, suggesting that other carbon substrates can also be used
to improve this behavior. In addition, SWV demonstrated to be an effective
technique to estimate the potential for the (Lys)6-tagged
rHbI Fe(III)/(II) redox couple. More importantly, the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs biocomposite showed good electrocatalytic activity
with various H2S concentrations. The use of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI/VACNTs as a bioelectrode for H2S detection
system will be the subject of further studies.

4 Experimental
Section
MWCNTs-COOH, in powder form, was first used as a
model to understand
and to evaluate the immobilization process. We then used VACNTs-COOH
because they exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity and fast electron
transfer,33,54 which can be used for highly sensitive detection
of redox species.55 In addition, vertical
nanotube arrays are suitable for fabricating various electronic devices
and sensors.30

4.1 Immobilization
Reaction of (Lys)6-Tagged rHbI at MWCNTs-COOH
The immobilization reaction
was conducted with the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI in the presence
and absence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)
and 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and with the
(His)6-tagged rHbI in the presence of EDC/NHS. EDC and
NHS were employed to transform the hydroxyl group of the carboxylic
group into a good leaving group (amine-reactive NHS ester), which
favors the amide bond formation with the protein.27 This amide bond formation occurs by a nucleophilic attack
of the amine side chain of the lysine. Thus, in the absence of EDC/NHS,
no covalent modification is expected. Equally, no covalent immobilization
is expected for the (His)6-tagged rHbI through the His
tag. As stated in the Introduction, His tagged
proteins are mainly attached to the surfaces via noncovalent immobilization
such as adsorption. These two reactions were therefore used as controls.
It is important to mention that unoxidized MWCNTs were not evaluated
here because previous studies12 have demonstrated
that the amino acids with aromatic side chains in (Lys)6-tagged rHbI, which have π electrons available to interact
with the π electrons on the surface of CNTs, are buried residues
and most likely would not react with the CNTs. In addition, many of
the literature reviewed suggest a more efficient electron transfer
between proteins and electrodes when exist a direct and strong attachment
among them.15,16,56,57

The reaction of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI in the presence of coupling agents was conducted by
sonicating the MWCNTs-COOH with MES buffer pH 6.0, containing 0.2
M EDC and 0.1 M NHS for 1 h to ensure homogeneous dispersion, as well
as the generation of a semistable reactive NHS ester intermediate.27 Purified (Lys)6-tagged rHbI12 (5–20 mg in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7) was then
added, and the reaction was stirred for 16–18 h at 4 °C.
Nonconjugated adsorbed hemeprotein was removed by thoroughly washing
the nanotubes with water until no (Lys)6-tagged rHbI UV–vis
signal was detected in the washings (about eight washing cycle). (Lys)6-tagged rHbI shows a strong Soret band at 407 nm, with the
corresponding Q bands at 502 and 633 nm.12 The absence of these bands indicates the removal of protein in the
suspension. The amount of immobilized protein was evaluated by measuring
the concentration of the hemeprotein remaining in the supernatant
after the immobilization process using the Bradford method.58 In the Bradford method, the absorbance was measured
at 595 nm and related with protein concentration. The same procedure
was carried out without coupling agents and with the (His)6-tagged rHbI as controls. In both cases, once the reaction was completed,
the collected supernatant in each washing step was analyzed by UV–vis
and Bradford assay to determine the amount of protein bound to the
MWCNTs-COOH using differential analysis. Table 1 shows an example of the mathematical analysis
to determine the concentration of immobilized protein.

4.2 Immobilization Analysis of (Lys)6-Tagged rHbI/MWCNTs-COOH
Biocomposite
FTIR microspectroscopy
and TEM were used to assess the conjugation of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI at oxidized MWCNTs. For the FTIR analysis, 1 μL
of the sample was pipetted on the CaF2 window and dried
under N2 atmosphere. IR microspectra were recorded using
a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Spotlight microscope equipped with a 16-element
quasi-linear, photoconductive mercury cadmium telluride detector array.
Spectra were collected in transmission mode from 4000 to 700 cm–1, with 20 scans per point and an aperture of 50 ×
50 μm2. For background correction, one measurement
of an empty site with only the window present was used. The same procedure
was used for the controls ((Lys)6-tagged rHbI without coupling
agent and (His)6-tagged rHbI with coupling agent). To correct
for scattering effect, a baseline correction with a piecewise liner
approach was performed on each spectrum.59 TEM were recorded on a JEOL JEM-1400 TEM operating at 120 kV with
a charge-coupled device camera. A drop of sample dispersed in water
was placed on a copper grid and dried. TEM analysis was conducted
at the Center of Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

4.3 Immobilization Analysis of (Lys)6-Tagged
rHbI on a VACNTs-COOH
The immobilization procedure
on this substrate was conducted following the same procedure described
in Section 2.1, with
minor modifications. For example, the surface was immersed for at
least 30 min on 50 mM MES pH 6.0 to guarantee the carboxylate groups.
The carboxylic acid groups were activated by adding 200 μL of
400 mM EDC/100 mM NHS in 100 mM MES at pH 6.0 to the electrode surface
for 1 h, and then the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI was immobilized
at the oxidized carbon surface. The immobilization reaction was conducted
by the addition of 100 μL of the (Lys)6-tagged rHbI
(1–5 mg/mL) for 16–18 h at 4 °C. The nonimmobilized
protein was removed by washing with 0.1 M MES pH 6 as explained before.

The aligned carbon nanotube array used was grown by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PEVCD) on 50 nm chromium-coated Si substrate,
with a nanotube diameter ∼100 nm and target length 5–10
μm. Nanotubes site density is ∼5 × 106 CNTs/cm2 and attaching COOH groups to PEVCD carbon nanotubes
were part of the properties of this VACNTs. They were purchased from
NanoLab, Inc. with the above-described characteristics.

4.4 Surface Analysis on VACNTs-COOH
The
atomic force microscopy experiments were done on a Nanoscope Va from
Digital Instrument using a silicon tip at ambient atmosphere and temperature.
AFM images were obtained in tapping mode. Scan rates were varied from
1 to 2 Hz. The images presented here were repeatedly obtained in several
spots of the sample. All of the images (256 × 256 pixels) were
essentially unfiltered and analyzed with NanoScope8.0 software. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a JEOL JSM-6480 LV,
and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was done using an EDAX Genesis
2000 at 20 kV.

4.5 Electrochemical Immobilization
Analysis of
(Lys)6-Tagged rHbI on a VACNTs-COOH
Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV) were performed using an EC-Lab
v10.44 workstation (BioLogic Science Instrument). A conventional three-electrode
cell was used with a silver chloride (Ag/AgCl, NaCl 3 M) reference
electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and with VACNTs-COOH
(carbon substrate) as working electrode. All of the experiments were
done at ambient temperature (20.0 ± 0.5 °C).

The cyclic
voltammetry experiments were done in a solution of 1.0 mM of K3Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.0 from −0.400
V to 0.200 V vs Ag/AgCl, NaCl 3 M with a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Cyclic voltammetry on electrodes before and after
immobilization of (Lys)6-tagged rHbI was done in buffer
solutions without the protein. Buffers were purged with highly purified
nitrogen for at least 10 min before a series of experiments. The cell
was closed during the experiment to protect the solution from oxygen.
In the experiments with H2S, measured volumes (60 μL)
of a solution of 4 mM Na2S·9H2O in 0.1
M succinic acid pH 6.0 were injected with a syringe in a sealed cell
previously deoxygenated with purified nitrogen. All of the solutions
and buffers were prepared using deionized water (18 MΩ).

For the characterization with H2S, a solution 4 mM in
H2S was used. The H2S stock solution was prepared
by placing 20 mL of 0.1 M succinic acid, at pH 6.0, in a vial and
purged vigorously with nitrogen gas for 15 min before adding 9.60
mg of sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O). The vial
was sealed subsequently with a rubber stopper, kept in the dark, and
refrigerated at 2–8 °C until used after no more than 6
h of storage.
