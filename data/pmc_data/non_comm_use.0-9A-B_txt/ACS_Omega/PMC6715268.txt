Real-time intraoperative imaging for
brain tumor surgery is crucial for achieving complete resection. We
are developing novel lipid-based microbubbles (MBs), engineered with
specific ligands, which are able to interact with the integrins overexpressed
in the endothelium of the brain tumor vasculature. These MBs are designed
to visualize the tumor and to carry therapeutic molecules into the
tumor tissue, preserving the ultrasound acoustic properties of the
starting plain lipid MBs. The potential toxicity of this novel technology
was assessed in rats by intravenous injections of two doses of plain
MBs and MBs engineered for targeting and near-infrared fluorescence
visualization at two time-points, 10 min and 7 days, for potential
acute and chronic responses in rats [(1) MB, (2) MB-ICG, (3) MB-RGD,
and (4) MB-ICG-RGD]. No mortality occurred during the 7-day study
period in any of the dosing groups. All animals demonstrated a body
weight gain during the study period. Minor, mostly reversible changes
in hematological and biochemical analysis were observed in some of
the treated animals. All changes were reversible by the 7-day time-point.
Histopathology examination in the high-dose animals showed development
of foreign body granulomatous inflammation. We concluded that the
low-dose tested items appear to be safe. The results allow for proceeding
to clinical testing of the product.

Introduction
Gliomas
are neoplasms that arise within the cerebral parenchyma
and are characterized by an infiltrative growth pattern. Glioblastoma,
the most malignant form of cerebral gliomas, is associated with median
survival of only about 14 months.1 Maximal
surgical resection, however, has been shown to have a positive effect
on progression-free and overall survival.2,3 Complete
surgical resection of these infiltrative tumors is often hampered
by the absence of intraoperative real-time imaging to enable the demonstration
of the tumor’s boundaries during the operation. Certain surgical
modalities, such as intraoperative neuronavigation, 5-aminolevulinic
acid (5-ALA) fluorescence-guided tumor resection, and intraoperative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable the surgeons to evaluate the
extent of resection intraoperatively, but each of these modalities
has its own limitations.4,5 For example, 5-ALA leads
to the accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in the high-grade but
not low-grade glioma tissue. Intraoperative MRI supports the surgeons
with detailed image information, but it requires a high constructive,
logistic, and pecuniary effort associated with high costs and prolongation
of the total operative time. Intraoperative ultrasound (US) is a more
practical and cost-effective tool, allowing real-time imaging with
less effort compared with the other modalities. It has the potential
to avoid brain shift due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) loss and tissue
edema, which renders neuronavigation less reliable. One of its major
limitations is the difficult image interpretation.6 Therefore, improving intraoperative US image quality combined
with direct microscopy visualization is highly desirable to better
delineate the tumor margins for maximizing its resection.

Microbubbles
(MBs) have become a well-established contrast agent for US imaging,
improving both the US image quality and visualization of the tumor
vasculature.7 Conjugation of specific ligands
to a MB’s shell against overexpressed receptors in a glioblastoma
may allow for specific binding to the tumor and also may serve as
a novel theranostic platform to carry drugs specifically into the
tumor site.8 For example, integrins, a
family of heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules, play a crucial role
in cell–cell adhesion and cell–extracellular matrix
interactions.8,9 Conjugation of the MB shell with
RGD motif, tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp, a ligand for integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, which is overexpressed in the glioblastoma vasculature,10 may lead to selective adherence of MBs to the
tumor microvessel endothelium and specific accumulation in the tumor
site.8 The MBs’s lipid shell may
also be labeled with fluorophores, such as indocyanine green (ICG),
for direct fluorescent visualization through the operative microscope.11,12

In this work, a cyclic derivative of RGD with a cysteine moiety
included in the molecular scaffold, cRGDfC (Scheme 1), is used as this form of RGD favors the
interaction with the target integrins13 and offers a quantitative coupling to the MB surface bearing a maleimide
moiety.

Scheme 1 Structure of cRGDfC Peptide
The
thiol, −SH, highlighted in the circle
is the reactive group used for coupling to MBs.

Such modified lipid MBs have potential as novel multimodal
tools for tumor visualization, allowing for real-time intraoperative
imaging during tumor resection via both US and in parallel fusion
to the operative microscope.

The objective of this study is
to assess the potential toxic effects of newly designed US contrast
agents (UCAs), that is naked MB, MB labeled with ICG (MB-ICG), MB
coupled to RGD (MB-RGD), and MB labeled with ICG and coupled to RGD
(MB-ICG-RGD), following a single intravenous (IV) injection to male
Sprague-Dawley rats for better tumor vasculature visualization in
humans. The results reported in this work contribute to the understanding
of the not yet complete toxicology scenario involving MBs.

Materials and Methods
1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) sodium salt
(DPPG-Na), and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium salt (DSPE-PEG2000-Mal)
were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama (USA). tert-Butanol (t-BuOH), palmitic acid (PA),
poly(ethylene glycol) with molecular weight 3500–4500 (PEG
4000), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and ethanol were Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, (Italy)
products. BODIPY FL l-cystine and gel-immobilized (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine)
disulfide (TCEP) reducing agent were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Monza, MB (Italy). cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys)
(c-RGDfC) purchased from Peptides International,
Louisville, Kentucky (USA), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from
Rivoira Gas, Rome, RM (Italy), and ICG from Pulsion Medical System,
Munich (Germany) were used without further purification. Water of
Milli-Q purity grade (18.2 MΩ·cm) was produced with an
Elga PureLab Classic, High Wycombe, (UK) deionization apparatus.

Synthesis of Engineered MBs
MBs-RGD
Thirty mg of DSPC, 30 mg of DPPG-Na,
4.8 mg of DSPE-PEG2000-Mal, and 6 mg of PA were dissolved together
with 2.94 g of PEG 4000 in 31 mL of tert-butanol
in a round bottom glass vessel under reflux (82 °C). After complete
dissolution, the clear solution was rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen
and lyophilized by the freeze dryer Lio 5P, CinquePascal, Milan (Italy).
An aliquot (300 mg) of the obtained cake was introduced in a 20 mL
glass vial. The vial was closed with a rubber stopper and evacuated,
and the headspace was replaced by SF6. MBs were formed
by injecting PBS (7.2 mL, 10 mM) through the stopper into the vial
and by 20 s of vigorous shaking of the suspension to mix all components
until a milky homogeneous liquid had been obtained.

The MB suspension
was centrifuged twice: the infranatant was discharged to remove excess
components of nonforming MB shells, whereas the MBs in the supernatant
were resuspended in 7.2 mL of 10 mM PBS containing 5 mM EDTA. A total
of 900 μg of cysteine-tagged RGD, c-RGDfC (Scheme 1) was kept in reducing
conditions in the presence of 3.6 mM TCEP and 5 mM EDTA to avoid oxidation
and disulfide bonds formation between the cysteine moiety of the c-RGDfC molecules in solution. After 1 h at room temperature,
the TCEP reducing gel was discarded by centrifugation and c-RGDfC, in large excess as compared to the molar content
of DSPE-PEG2000-Mal moiety contained on the MB shells, was incubated
with MBs for 1 h at 4 °C (Scheme 2). To remove unreacted c-RGDfC, targeted
MBs-RGD were centrifuged twice and the infranatant was replaced by
PBS (7.2 mL, 10 mM) containing maltose at 10% w/v after each centrifugation
step. The MBs-RGD suspension was then poured in a 10 mL glass vial,
frozen with liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized.

Scheme 2 RGD-MBs Synthesis
Ligand Quantitation on MBs
A direct quantitative
estimation of the c-RGDfC ligand is difficult to
accomplish. To overcome such a hurdle, without changing the coupling
reaction to MBs and its stoichiometry, c-RGDfC is
replaced with fluorescent, thiol-containing reduced BODIPY-cystine
(see Scheme 2). BODIPY-cystine
was incubated with MBs after reduction with an equivalent volume of
TCEP disulfide-reducing gel. The amount
of maleimide groups using a tenfold excess of reduced BODIPY-cystine
reproduced exactly the reaction conditions used for the coupling of c-RGDfC to the MBs. The number of fluorophore-conjugated
MBs (BODIPY-MBs) was determined by optical microscopy using the counting
chamber of a hemocytometer. The MBs were then disrupted by sonication,
and the fluorescence of the resulting solution was assessed by RF-5301
PC Shimadzu, Milan, (Italy) with excitation and emission slit widths
of 1.5 nm and sensitivity set to “high”. The determination
of the concentration of bound BODIPY was based on a “fluorescence
intensity versus free BODIPY concentration” calibration curve
covering the BODIPY concentration ranging from 0.02 to 0.45 μM
(see Figure S1 of Supporting Information). The fluorescence intensity measured of the BODIPY-MBs dispersion
was related to the MB concentration to determine the c-RGDfC density
on the MB surface. This method provided an extent of conjugation of
1.9 × 106 molecules of ligand per MB.

Naked MBs
Nontargeted lipid MBs (naked
MBs) as the control test item were also prepared according to the
procedure described above, with the exclusion of DSPE-PEG2000-Mal
in the MB formulation and by skipping the reaction step with c-RGDfC.

MB Reconstitution
and ICG Labeling
MB samples were freshly prepared before
dosing the animals. The chemical and physical integrity of the freeze-dried
cake containing DSPC, DPPG-Na, and PEG 4000 from which the MBs are
prepared, was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As
shown in Figure S2, the thermogram displays
an endothermic peak at 60 °C, typical of the melting of PEG 4000,
which is the major component of the cake. MBs were stored as lyophilized
powders of naked MBs and MBs-RGD in glass vials. For their reconstitution,
the powder was purged with SF6 gas through the glass vial
stopper septum with inlet and outlet needles to remove air and to
fill the headspace of the container. Before use, 5 mL physiological
saline was added to 25 mg of the freeze-dried powder per vial and
vigorously shacked, Figure S3. To obtain
fluorescent-labeled MBs, for example, MBs-ICG and MBs-ICG-RGD, lyophilized
MBs (either naked or RGD engineered) were reconstituted by adding
1 mL of ICG solution (5 mg/mL in water) and up to 5 mL of physiological
saline to reach a final ICG concentration of 1 mg/mL. Samples were
shaken vigorously after reconstitution to obtain a milky MBs suspension.
One vial of the freeze-dried MBs yielded a suspension of approximately
108 MBs/mL.

A characterization of naked MBs suspension
after reconstitution is reported in the Supporting Information section together with the instrumental setup used
for the determinations. The size and size distribution of naked MBs
is shown in Figure S4. An average diameter
of 2.8 μm with a standard deviation of 1 μm was determined.
The US acoustic properties of the MBs depend on their size distribution.
We tested the US behavior of the synthetized naked MBs from 0.5 to
10 MHz with the setup described in Figure 4.
Attenuation spectra (Figure S5) were recorded
at different MBs floating times.

Animals
Fifty-four eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats
weighing 300 g ± 20% for 18 test groups were obtained from Envigo
RMS, Israel. All dosing solutions were injected by a single IV injection
into one of the tail veins of the animals. Test items were injected
in two volume doses of 2 and 20 mL/kg, corresponding to 252 and 2520
mg/kg, respectively, of formulations containing naked MBs, MB-ICGs,
MB-RGDs, and MB-ICG-RGDs for either 10 min or 7 days postdosing. These
time-points were chosen to assess the acute and chronic response to
the IV MBs administration.

As control, a saline was injected
at the highest volume dosage of 20 mL/kg (see Supporting Information Table S1). The study was approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the National Council for
Animal Experimentation, and all procedures were conducted within compliance
of their regulations.

Clinical Signs and
Body Weight
Careful clinical examinations were carried out,
and the results were recorded immediately following the dosing. For
animals scheduled for sacrifice at 7 days postdosing, additional once-daily
observations were performed for the detection of changes in skin,
fur, eyes, mucous membranes, occurrence of secretions and excretions
(e.g., diarrhea), and autonomic activity (e.g., lacrimation, salivation,
piloerection, pupil size, and unusual respiratory pattern). Changes
in gait, posture, and response to handling, as well as the presence
of irregular behavior, tremors, convulsions, or coma were also inspected.
The eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were expected to increase
their body weight during the study period of 7 days, accordingly determinations
of individual body weights of the animals were carried out shortly
prior to dosing (day 0), on day 2, and on day 7 (at study termination).

Clinical Pathology
Hematology
and biochemistry parameters listed in Tables S2 and S3 in Supporting Information were determined in all
animals before the scheduled necropsy. For animals scheduled for sacrifice
10 min postdosing, blood was drawn at 10 min postdosing and immediately
after the animals were sacrificed. Individual blood samples were obtained
by retro-orbital sinus bleeding under CO2 anesthesia. Following completion
of blood collection, all samples (whole blood and serum) were kept
at 2–8 °C until transported for analysis to the American
Medical Laboratories (Israel) Ltd.

Necropsy Procedure and Macroscopic Examination
Following
the respective termination time-points, the animals were euthanized
by CO2 asphyxiation and subjected to a fully detailed necropsy
and gross pathological examination. At necropsy, the animals underwent
thorough examinations, including the external surface of the body,
all orifices, and cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their
contents. Any abnormality or gross pathological change observed in
tissues and/or organs was recorded.

Organ/Tissue Collection, Weighing, and Fixation
The brain,
kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen were collected from each animal
during the respective scheduled necropsy session and fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin (approximately 4% formaldehyde solution).
In addition, any other organ/tissue with gross macroscopic change/s
was collected, recorded, and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin.
Slide preparations and histopathological examinations for abnormalities
detected during necropsy were performed. The wet brains, kidneys,
livers, lungs, and spleens were weighed as soon as possible following
their dissection.

Histology and
Histopathology
The harvested tissues from each animal were
transferred to Patho-Lab Diagnostics Ltd. for slide preparation. The
tissues were trimmed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at an approximately
5 μm thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
The histopathological changes were described and scored by the study
pathologist using semiquantitative scoring of five grades (0–4),
taking into consideration the severity of the changes (0 = no lesion,
1 = minimal change, 2 = mild change, 3 = moderate change, 4 = marked
change). After histopathological evaluation, the finding in each test
item-treated animal was concurrently compared to the respective control
animal to verify any potential treatment-related effect.

Results
There was no mortality
among any of the test items-treated or saline-treated control animals
throughout the entire 7-day study period. Clinical signs were confined
to all high-dose-treated groups immediately following dosing, and
they consisted of either decreased motor activity or slight dyspnea.
All clinical signs faded within a few hours and no other signs were
observed throughout the remaining 7-day study period. All animals
who reached the end of the 7-day study period made comparable body
weight gains expected for eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats.

Hematology
There were increases in
the red blood cell (RBC) count and hemoglobin (HGB) levels in all
high-dose test groups compared to the control. An increase in hematocrit
(HCT) was evident in all high-dose test groups compared to the control,
and it reached above the normal range for this species. There was
a reduction in platelet counts in all high-dose test groups at the
10 min sacrifice time-point compared to the control, and it dropped
below the normal range for this species. The reduction was more pronounced
in the RGD-containing MBs (with or without ICG)-treated animals. One
animal from the low-dose MBs-ICG-treated group displayed an absolute
lymphocytosis, with a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.8 ×
103 cells/μL (∼4 time higher than the upper
limit of the normal value for this species), 100% lymphocytes, and
a two-fold reduction in RBC count compared to normal values. An increase
in total WBC count above the normal range was observed in the group
of low-dose MBs-RGD. An increased total WBC was also observed in all
other groups, including the vehicle-treated rats compared to their
respective 10 min counterparts, although the values were within the
normal range for this species. The increase did not change the neutrophils-to-lymphocytes
ratio in the blood (Table S2, in Supporting Information).

Blood Biochemistry
There
was an increase in glucose levels in the high-dose-treated groups,
an increase in total serum bilirubin in the MBs-ICG with or without
RGD-treated group, a decrease in total protein and serum albumin levels
in the MBs-ICG with or without RGD-treated groups, and a decrease
in potassium levels in the high-dose-treated groups (below the normal
range for these species) after 10 min. The 7-day test and vehicle
control treatment groups exhibited comparable values (Table S3, in Supporting Information).

Organ Weight
Aside from the changes found in spleen
weight, which may indicate erythrocyte release and contribute to the
rise in circulating RBCs, there was no apparent toxicity resulting
from the noted changes in organ weight. At the 10 min sacrifice time-point,
a reduction in the spleen weight ranging between ∼10 and 20%
was noted in high-dose naked MBs, high-dose MBs-ICG, high-dose MBs-ICG-RGD,
low-dose MBs-RGD, and low-dose MBs-ICG-RGD compared to the vehicle
control-treated animals. A similar-sized reduction in lung weight
was measured in all test groups at the 10 min sacrifice time-point
with the exception of the low-dose MBs-RGD-treated group. At the 7
day sacrifice time-point, there was an increase in the lung weight
ranging between ∼20 and 30% in the low-dose naked MBs, low-dose
MBs-ICG-, and low-dose MBs-RGD-treated groups (Table 1).

Gross
Necropsy Observations
A single animal from the MBs-RGD high-dose-treated
group displayed hemorrhage-like lesions in a 1–2 mm interval
striped appearance throughout the small intestine up to the cecum.
No other treatment-related abnormalities were noted. A green discoloration
in some organs was observed in animals treated with the green dye
ICG at the 10 min sacrifice time-point. The groups treated with low
doses displayed discoloration in the duodenum, and the groups treated
with high doses displayed discoloration in the duodenum, liver, pancreas,
and jejunum (Table S4 in Supporting Information).

Histopathological Evaluation
Histopathology examination revealed treatment-related changes in
the kidneys and lungs. In the kidneys, mild tubular dilation was noted
in all animals injected with the dose level of 2520 mg/kg and sacrificed
10 min postdosing. In particular, the tubular dilation was seen in
the high-dose naked MB (Figure 1), high-dose MB-ICG (Figure 2), and high-dose MB-RGD and high-dose MB-ICG-RGD animals
(Figure 3).

The
tubular dilation involved the entire surface of the kidney, extending
in the cortex, outer and inner medulla, and papilla. The lumen of
the dilated tubules was empty, and the lining epithelium was either
normal or minimally flattened. No degeneration, necrosis, inflammation,
or abnormal contents was noted in the affected tubules. As no obstruction
of the tubules was noted, it was assumed that the dilation was not
related to distal absorption of the tubules. The terminology of tubule
dilation was selected according to the criteria set in Frazier et
al. in 2012.14 No treatment-related renal
changes were noted in any of the animals from the same dose group
that were sacrificed 7 days postdosing. It may therefore be considered
that the primary tubular dilation observed after 10 min from dosing
had recovered after 7 days postdosing. In addition, it can be concluded
that the tubular dilation did not progress to cause damage of the
lining epithelium. It is suggested that the induction of tubular dilation
was apparently related to the large-dose volume (i.e., 20 mL/kg) containing
the MBs. In the lungs, minimal-to-mild intravascular accumulation
of grayish amorphous (fluid-like) material was noted only in the animals
injected with the dose level of 2520 mg/kg (naked MB, MB-ICG, MB-RGD,
and MB-ICG-RGD) (Figures 4 and 5).

with granulomatous reaction within the blood vessel is considered

7M40 (lower-right), sections of the lungs (×20). Presence of
homogenous greyish foreign body with (7M40) and without (7M57) granulomatous

(yellow arrow).

The
changes observed in the animals sacrificed 10 min postdosing were
characterized by the presence of intravascular accumulation of grayish
amorphous (fluid-like) material, whereas in the animals sacrificed
7 days postdosing, the intravascular accumulation of grayish amorphous
(fluid-like) material was associated with foreign body granulomatous
reaction, indicating that there was a clearing process of the intravascular
accumulated material. Given that the intravascular accumulation of
the injected material was associated with the development of foreign
body granulomatous inflammation (i.e., a change observed only in the
2520 mg/kg-dosed groups), it is considered as an adverse effect, in
accordance with the recently published Society of Toxicologic Pathology
(STP) “Recommended (“Best”) Practices for Determining,
Communicating, and Using Adverse Effect Data from Nonclinical Studies”
(11). All other observed changes were considered as being spontaneous
incidental findings and as having no relation to the treatment.

Discussion
Image-guided
intraoperative navigation has become an integral component of modern
cranial neurosurgery. Although preoperative MRI and CT scans can be
reliably used for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation,
they are unable to account for intraoperative brain shifts due to
patient positioning, CSF loss, tumor debulking, gravity, and cerebral
edema.15,16 Intraoperative US provides an improved ability
to account for such anatomical changes.17 Intraoperative contrast-enhanced US offers an evolving tool for
neuronavigation and intraoperative imaging, with the unique advantages
of combining dynamic imaging and real-time perfusion data. Contrast
agents used for this purpose are composed of MBs that remain within
the vasculature, thereby allowing characterization of the arterial
and venous network. This offers the potential for differentiating
normal brain from neoplastic tissue, delineating feeding arteries
and draining veins within the surgical bed, and providing information
with regard to hemodynamic alterations and real-time extent of the
resection.17,18 Notably, the safety profile of MBs allows
multiple injections throughout the operation, highlighting changes
in enhancement patterns at different stages of the surgery.19,20 SonoVue MBs, a known contrast agent for US imaging, is made of MBs
stabilized by a shell of phospholipids, encapsulating sulphur hexafluoride
(SF6), which is an innocuous gas. Recent advancements in
US and MBs technology have shown that MBs can be molecularly targeted
by adding binding ligands onto the shell that allow them to specifically
accumulate at certain target area sites.21 We aim to develop a combined imaging technology for the diagnostic
and tailored therapeutic intervention for patients bearing gliomas.
As part of creating a new multimodal imaging system, we will employ
a new generation of MBs that simultaneously act as contrast agents
for intraoperative US imaging and intraoperative fluorescence-guided
microscopic resection of gliomas. For this purpose, we have designed
novel MBs attached to specific glioma ligands and engineered to act
as platforms for delivering drugs to the tumor site, for which a toxicology
investigation was necessary.

Our novel engineered MBs are targeted
to molecules that are differentially expressed on the vasculature
named αvβ3 integrins.10 In this study, we assessed the potential toxic
effects of (1) the naked MBs, (2) the MBs having the shells conjugated
with RGD motif, (3) the MBs labeled with the fluorophore ICG for direct
fluorescent visualization through the operative microscope, and (4)
the MBs carrying both RGD and ICG molecules on the shells following
a single IV injection to male Sprague-Dawley rats. No toxic effect
was noted in our study following a single IV injection of any of the
test items at a dose level of 252 mg/kg related to a single molecule
or to a combination of molecules attached to the MBs surface.

The increased level of RBCs at the 10 min time-point should be interpreted
with caution because the size of the injected MBs is comparable to
that of the RBCs in the circulation (∼7 μm in diameter),
and hence, the count may be skewed and the reported result may be
an artifact. Rapid release of RBCs either from the spleen and/or bone
marrow may also explain the increase in the RBC count. The spleen
can serve as an RBC reservoir, and reversible release of RBCs in response
to stress was reported in the rats.22 In
the current study, with the exception of the high-dose MBs-RGD-treated
group, there was a corresponding decrease in the spleen size in the
high-dose treatment groups (∼12–18% compared to vehicle
control), although it may be still be attributed to weight variation
among individual rats. However, the histopathological examination
revealed no treatment-related changes in the spleen. The increase
in RBC count and HGB levels and the decrease in platelets number in
the high-dose treatment groups were reversible by the 7-day time-point.
Absolute lymphocytosis was noted in a single case. As the group size
is small (n = 3/time-point/group), it is difficult
to determine whether this is treatment-related, especially because
there were no comparable occurrences in the animals treated with high
doses of the same test item.

All changes in blood biochemistry
noted at the 10 min time-points were reversible by the 7-day time-point.
The increase in the blood glucose level may be attributed to the high
level of maltose (disaccharide of glucose) in the MBs formulation
(>97%). The decrease in total protein and serum albumin levels
and the increase in bilirubin levels in the high-dose ICG-treated
groups are expected changes because ICG is known to bind serum albumin
and to increase serum bilirubin, probably by inhibition of its hepatic
uptake.23

Increase in organ weight
(Table 1), that is
10–20%, was noted in the spleen and lungs at the 10 min sacrifice
time-point for any type of dose and MBs conjugation. At 7 day postdosing,
the lung weight increased by 20–30% for the low-dose-treated
animals. Changes in the organ weights were noted in the spleen and
lungs in both time-points. However, aside from the changes in the
spleen weight which may indicate erythrocyte release and contribute
to the rise in circulating RBCs, there was no apparent toxicity from
the changes observed in organ weight.

Histopathological evaluation
revealed that the treatment-related changes in the kidneys consisted
of mild tubular dilation, and it was seen in all animals injected
with the dose level of 2520 mg/kg and sacrificed 10 min postdosing.
The lumen of the dilated tubules was empty, and the lining epithelium
was normal or minimally flattened. The treatment-related changes in
the lungs consisted of minimal-to-mild intravascular accumulation
of a grayish amorphous (fluid-like) material, possibly comprising
of the injected test compound, which was observed only in the animals
injected with the dose level of 2520 mg/kg. This accumulation was
associated with foreign body granulomatous reaction at 7 days postdosing,
indicating that a clearing process had started. In fact, it was reported
that debris originating from MBs deflation and fragmentation during
body circulation and US exposure remains on the surface of endothelial
cells for a significant period of time during which they can be recognized
by the immune system.24

For conclusions,
we compared potential toxic effects of lipid naked MBs, ICG adsorbed
onto MBs surface (MB-ICG), tripeptide motif Arg-Gly-Asp (MB-RGD) tethered
to MBs and combinations of all of the above (MB-ICG-RGD) following
a single IV injection in male Sprague-Dawley rats for better tumor
vasculature visualization in the human brain. No definite toxic effect
was noted in any of the test items at a dose level of 252 mg/kg, related
to a single molecule or to a combination of molecules attached to
MBs surface. This finding leads us to conclude that these agents are
safe. The 10-fold higher dose level of 2520 mg/kg, however, of each
of the tested items was associated with adverse effects. These results
allow us to go ahead with planning an efficacy study before going
to the first attempt to use this technology in clinical practice.
