We
herein describe the synthesis of novel pentafluorinated tolane
fluorophores, which possess an extended π-conjugated structure
with a large molecular dipole moment along the longitudinal axis.
We also report a detailed evaluation of both the photophysical and
thermal behaviors of these fluorophores. All molecules displayed photoluminescence
(PL) characteristics in both the crystalline state and in dilute solutions.
The large longitudinal dipole moment induced solvatochromic PL behavior,
which switched sensitively with changes in the solvent polarity. In
addition, incorporation of the fluorinated tolane-based solid-state
light-emitting moiety into the polymer side chain was found to be
responsible for the PL characteristics observed in the solid state.
It was also noteworthy that the polymerization protocol led to a significant
enhancement in the thermal stability, with the thermal decomposition
temperature increased by 90 °C. Accordingly, novel solid-state
light-emitting materials with high thermal stabilities were successfully
developed as promising candidates for use in light-emitting and optoelectronic
applications.

Introduction
Light-emitting molecules
that luminesce in the solid state are
important materials because of their broad application in lighting
and optoelectronic devices.1 In general,
owing to their intense fluorescent characteristic in dilute solutions,
fluorescent dye molecules consisting of a simple π-conjugated
structure, for example, pyrene, coumarin, or boron dipyrromethene,
have been applied as fluorescent brightening agents, diagnostic fluorescent
markers, and fluorescent indicators. In contrast, the fluorescence
of such compounds is easily quenched at high concentrations or in
the solid state because of aggregation-caused quenching.2,3 However, the rapid development of luminescent molecules that function
in the solid state has been reported since the discovery of two new
luminescent phenomena, namely crystallization-induced emission enhancement4,5 and aggregation-induced emission enhancement,6,7 both
of which dramatically enhance emission intensities because of the
inhibition of nonradiative decay through the restricted intramolecular
rotation caused by molecular aggregation. Thus, owing to the growing
demand for solid-state light-emitting materials for use in various
optical applications, the discovery of novel solid-state fluorophores
remains both a challenge and a priority.

Over the past few decades,
we have focused on the development of
efficient synthetic procedures toward versatile fluorine-containing
molecules,8,9 as we are interested in the unique ability
of the fluorine atom to dramatically alter the chemical reactivity
of compounds in addition to both their physical and chemical properties.10 On the basis of our accumulated knowledge into
synthetic methodologies toward fluorinated organic molecules, we recently
focused on the development of functional materials, that is, liquid-crystalline
and photoluminescence (PL) materials, containing fluorinated partial
structures. As a result, we discovered novel fluorine-containing π-conjugated
molecules with an intriguing PL characteristic. More specifically,
we reported PL-emitting polyfluorinated bistolanes whose color could
be tuned by varying the electron density distributions and aggregation
structures in condensed phases.11 However,
despite their unique PL properties, these bistolane derivatives required
long reaction sequences for their preparation.

For the purpose
of this study, we therefore selected polyfluorinated
tolane (diphenylacetylene) derivatives as alternative candidates because
of their ready availability and their potent PL characteristics originating
from their extended π-conjugated structures and their fluorine-induced
electron density distribution. Indeed, few studies have been published
into fluorine-containing tolane derivatives with solid-state PL characteristics,
although several analogs have been reported so far.12 Thus, to discover promising fluorinated organic materials
with intensive solid-state PL characteristics, we report the systematic
preparation of novel-fluorinated tolane derivatives and subsequent
evaluation of their photophysical and thermal characteristics (Figure 1). In addition, we
wish to disclose the development of novel light-emitting materials
with high thermal stabilities, which are based on the polyfluorinated
tolane scaffold.

in this study.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Crystal Structures
Pentafluorinated tolanes 1a–1f, which bear a range of flexible alkoxy chains,
were synthesized according to the synthetic procedure outlined in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedure
for the Preparation of Pentafluorinated Tolanes 1a–1f
As indicated in the scheme,
pentafluorinated tolanes 1a–1c bearing short alkoxy
substituents, that is, CH3O (n = 1), C2H5O (n =
2), and n-C3H7O (n = 3), were synthesized in isolated yields of 61–72% via a
facile single-step protocol, namely a Pd(0)-catalyzed Sonogashira
cross-coupling reaction of commercially available (4-alkoxyphenyl)acetylenes 2a–2c with iodopentafluorobenzene. In contrast, compounds 1d–1f, which bear longer alkoxy chains (i.e., n = 4–6), were effectively prepared from readily
available 1-alkoxy-4-bromobenzenes 3d–3f over
a three-step manipulation according to the reported procedure.13 More specifically, following a Pd(0)-catalyzed
Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of 3d, 3e, or 3f with (trimethylsilyl)acetylene, the trimethylsilyl-protecting
group was removed to give (4-alkoxyphenyl)acetylenes 2d–2f, and a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction with iodopentafluorobenzene
produced the desired tolanes 1d–1f. Purification
of all compounds 1a–1f was achieved via a double
purification technique involving column chromatography followed by
recrystallization from CH2Cl2/MeOH (v/v = 1:1).
The molecular structures of 1a–1f were fully characterized
by 1H, 13C, and 19F nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS). Importantly, the NMR results confirmed that
the prepared compounds were of sufficient purity to evaluate their
photophysical properties.

Among the obtained crystalline products, 1b and 1f, which bear ethoxy and hexyloxy substituents,
respectively,
furnished single crystals appropriate for X-ray crystallographic analysis.
The crystal structures, packing structures, and observed short-contact
distances for these two compounds are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (A,C) Crystal structures of the ethoxy-substituted 1b and the hexyloxy-substituted 1f. (B,D) Packing
structures
of 1b and 1f, and the short contacts observed
in the crystal structures.

As indicated in Figure 2, the two aromatic rings in the diphenylacetylene (tolane)
scaffold formed a coplanar structure in the crystalline lattice, which
facilitated the construction of antiparallel dimeric structures through
electrostatic π–π interactions between the alkoxy-substituted
electron-rich aromatic ring and the electron-deficient pentafluorobenzene
moiety (Figure 2A,C).
The closest interatomic distance between two aromatic rings involved
in π–π stacking was 349 pm for 1b and
341 pm for 1f. These values are comparable for the sum
of the van der Waals (vdW) radii for two carbon atoms (i.e., CvdW = 170 pm).14 According
to the packing structures shown in Figure 2B,D, both 1b and 1f formed ordered structures through intermolecular interactions such
as hydrogen bonding, vdW interactions, and π–π
interactions. Taking the vdW radii for hydrogen (HvdW =
120 pm) and fluorine (FvdW = 147 pm) into consideration,
it was apparent that two H···F hydrogen bonds were
present in the crystal structures of 1b and 1f, thereby promoting the formation of stable packed structures. In
the case of the hexyloxy-substituted 1f, a relatively
short Halkyl···Halkyl contact
(286 pm) was also observed between two neighboring hexyloxy-chains,
which is likely because of the formation of ordered crystal structures.

Photophysical Properties in Solution
With the novel
pentafluorinated tolanes in hand, dilute solutions of the various
compounds were prepared in CH2Cl2, and their
UV–vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded to investigate
their photophysical properties in the solution state. Thus, Figure 3A shows the obtained
absorption and PL spectra; the photophysical data are summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Figure 3A, all pentafluorinated tolane derivatives exhibited
absorption bands
between 240 and 350 nm. According to a previous report into the photophysics
of unsubstituted tolanes,15 the absorption
band at 250 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition
from the ground S0 state to the excited singlet S2 state because of the forbidden direct excitation from S0 to the lowest S1 state. In addition, the absorption band
observed at ∼300 nm is likely to be a peculiar intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) band originating from the C≡C triple
bond stretching and aromatic ring-breathing vibrations of unsymmetrically
disubstituted tolane derivatives with both electron-donating and -withdrawing
substituents.12a,16

To confirm the vertical
electronic transition, we performed quantum
chemical calculations using the Gaussian 09W software package.17 The ground-state geometries were optimized using
the density functional theory (DFT) approach with the CAM-B3LYP functional18 and the 6-31+G(d) basis set with the implicit
solvation model, the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM),19 for CH2Cl2. Excited structures
were also calculated by time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations using
the same functional and basis set. The calculated data, including
the excitation energies, oscillator strengths (f),
and electronic transitions, are listed in Table 1.

For all compounds (1a–1f), the TD-DFT calculations
indicated the existence of a single possible vertical electronic excitation
with a large oscillator strength (f), which was assigned
as a direct transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO). Upon careful examination
of the frontier molecular orbital contributions for both HOMO and
LUMO (Figures S48–S59 in the Supporting Information), we found that the orbital lobe at the HOMO was
mainly distributed over the alkoxy-substituted electron-rich aromatic
ring, whereas the orbital lobe at the LUMO was localized over the
electron-deficient pentafluorophenyl ring, thereby indicating that
the major HOMO → LUMO transition likely originates from the
ICT transition. In addition, molecular dipole moments along the longitudinal
axis (μ∥gr) in the ground state were 4.84–5.31 D, which suggests
that both the electron-rich and -deficient aromatic rings in 1a–1f caused intramolecular charge separation in CH2Cl2. These theoretical evaluations were therefore
consistent with the experimental results obtained by UV–vis
absorption experiments.

Subsequently, the steady-state PL spectra
(see Figure 3A) for
dilute CH2Cl2 solutions of 1a–1f (i.e., 10–6 mol L–1) were examined
by irradiation
at the absorption maximum wavelength (i.e., λex =
311–314 nm). In all cases, the maximum PL wavelengths were
between 396 and 408 nm, and all compounds exhibited a large Stokes
shift20 (6700–7400 cm–1), despite a small Stokes shift (∼1000 cm–1) being previously reported in the case of nonsubstituted tolanes
in solution.12a,15 Considering the longitudinal
molecular dipole moment present in the excited S1 state
(μ∥ex = 6.34–6.88 D) as calculated by TD-DFT calculations, it is
reasonable to assume that the PL band moves to longer wavelengths
through a radiationless stabilization of excited molecules via solvent
reorganization. The large μ∥ex as well as free rotation of aromatic
rings also seem to affect the luminescence efficiency because of enhancement
of S1 → T1 intersystem crossing, resulting
in low ΦPL.21

To
further confirm that all PL in solution originated from ICT
transitions, the PL behavior was examined using alternative solvents
with different ET(30) values,22 which is one of the promising indicators for
solvent polarity, that is, hexane (Hex, 31.0), ethyl acetate (AcOEt,
38.1), acetone (acetone, 40.7), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 43.2), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 45.1), and
acetonitrile (MeCN, 45.6) (see Figure 3B). Upon comparison of the various PL spectra obtained
for 1f, the lower ET(30)
value for hexane resulted in the emission signals shifting to lower
wavelengths, whereas the solvent with higher ET(30) value, for example, DMF, DMSO, and MeCN, led to a shift
to longer wavelengths. The theoretical calculations and experimental
results thereby indicated that the PL of 1 in the solution
state can be assigned as an ICT transition. Furthermore, as shown
in the CIE color diagram (Figure 3D), deep blue PL was observed for compounds 1a–1f in CH2Cl2, although this color changed depending
on the solvent polarity, as MeCN resulted in light-blue PL.

Photophysical
Properties in the Crystal Form
Our attention
was then directed toward the solid-state PL behavior of compounds 1a–1f. All PL measurements were performed for crystalline
samples prepared by recrystallization and held between two quartz
plates. The obtained PL spectra and the corresponding photophysical
data are shown in Figure 4A and summarized in Table 2.

form.

As indicated, pentafluorinated tolane 1a, which bears
a methoxy substituent at the longitudinal terminal, gave a broad PL
band with an emission maximum wavelength (λPL) of
477 nm. In sharp contrast, 1b–1f possessed sharp
PL bands at shorter wavelengths (λPL = 398–403
nm). As shown in Figure 4B, comparison of the PL colors showed that crystalline 1a emitted blue-white PL with CIE coordinates of (0.23, 0.29), whereas
crystalline 1b–1f exhibited deep-blue PL similar
to that observed in CH2Cl2. After measuring
PL lifetime (τ) with monitoring at the emission maximum wavelength,
the τ for 1a–1f was found to be on the order
of nanoseconds, which indicates that the luminescence at the λPL is fluorescence (Table S2, Figure S45). Considering the crystal-packing
structures of 1b and 1f (Figure 2), intermolecular π–π
interactions between the electron-rich and -deficient aromatic rings
to form ordered layered structures promoted the nonradiative deactivation
of the excited molecules in the crystal, thereby resulting in the
PL band being shifted to significantly longer wavelengths in comparison
with the excitation wavelengths. As shown in Figure S44, excitation spectra for 1b–1f showed
sharp signal with a relatively large long-wavelength shift compared
to the corresponding absorption band, which creates discrete excitation
structure to emit luminescence in sharp spectral band. In contrast,
the 1a showed broad excitation band with close wavelength
to the absorption band, which can be expected to exist multiple structures
with a different crystal system involving a weak intermolecular interaction
in the ground state. Because of the multiple crystalline structures
in the ground state, it can be considered that various excimer sites
catch the exciton to emit luminescence with a broad spectrum shape.
Although this difference has not yet been fully accounted for, it
is anticipated that 1a may possess polymorphic aggregates
through the numerous intermolecular interactions present because of
the small methoxy substituent. In addition, the PL efficiency (ΦPL) in the crystalline state was 0.07–0.21, which was
somewhat lower than that of the pentafluorinated bistolane (≤0.66)
reported previously by our group.11a As
previously mentioned, compounds 1a–1f formed ordered
packing structures in the crystal state, which promoted the nonradiative
deactivation process, resulting in a lower ΦPL value,
although the twisted bistolane scaffold led to high ΦPL values through effective suppression of the nonradiative process.

Development of Light-Emitting Polymers Bearing the Pentafluorinated
Tolane Scaffold
We then decided to focus on the evolution
of solid-state luminescent pentafluorinated tolane derivatives to
give light-emitting materials with high thermal stabilities, as organic
light-emitting diodes can be prepared through repeated thermal deposition
cycles and annealing processes at temperatures >150 °C. Indeed,
we found that the thermal decomposition temperatures (Tdec) of 1c and 1f, that is,
the temperature where 5% weight loss had taken place, were 158 and
181 °C, respectively (Figure S47).
Thus, as neither of these compounds would be suitable for thermal
treatment processes, we examined the development of novel solid-state
light-emitting molecules with high thermal stabilities. In this context,
we conducted the novel preparation of light-emitting polymer materials
containing the structural motifs of 1c and 1f in the side chain, as polymer materials are known to possess independent
characteristics originating from both the main chain and the side
chain. In this case, polymers bearing the pentafluorinated tolane
scaffold in the side chain would likely be solid-state light-emitting
materials that exhibit high thermal stabilities. Indeed, novel pentafluorinated
tolane derivatives bearing a polymerizable functional group (i.e.,
the methacryloyl group) in the flexible moiety were prepared, and
subsequent radical polymerization in the presence of a catalytic amount
of a radical initiator were demonstrated. The synthetic procedure
for preparation of the desired polymers 5 is outlined
in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Synthetic
Procedure for the Preparation of Light-Emitting Polymers 5 Bearing the Pentafluorinated Tolane Scaffold
Thus, upon the treatment of 4-[3-(methoxymethoxy)propoxy]phenylacetylene
(6c), which was readily accessible from 4-bromophenol,
with iodopentafluorobenzene (1.5 equiv) in the presence of 5 mol %
Cl2Pd(PPh3)2 and PPh3 and
10 mol % CuI in Et3N at 60 °C over 20 h, the Sonogashira
cross-coupling reaction took place efficiently to give the corresponding
methoxymethyl-terminated pentafluorinated tolane 7c in
68% yield. Subsequent treatment with concentrated hydrochloric acid
smoothly cleaved the C–O bond to give the corresponding OH-terminated
product 8c in 60% yield. The condensation of 8c with methacryloyl chloride in the presence of excess Et3N in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 25 °C over 24 h successfully provided
the corresponding propylene-linked monomer 9c in 88%
isolated yield. Under identical conditions, methacrylate monomer 9f bearing a hexylene linkage was obtained from 6f in a 41% yield over three steps. With monomers 9c and 9f in hand, the N,N′-azobis(isobutyronitrile)
(AIBN)-initiated radical polymerization was examined; vigorous stirring
of 9c or 9f in the presence of 5 mol % AIBN
in degassed THF at 60 °C for 24 h, followed by reprecipitation
by the addition of MeOH yielded 5c (or 5f) as a yellow solid in 64% (or 86%) yield. Polymer characterization,
that is, determination of the average molecular weight, the polydispersity,
and the glass transition temperature (Tg), was carried out by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), as summarized in Table 3.

GPC measurements using CHCl3 as the eluent revealed
that the number average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of polymer 5c were 3500 and 6500, respectively,
which gave a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 1.89. Similarly, the Mn, Mw, and Mw/Mn values for polymer 5f were 10 400, 21 900, and 2.10, respectively. DSC measurements
also revealed that the two polymers had glass transition temperatures
(Tg) of 31.0 °C (5c)
and 10.3 °C (5f) on the second heating cycle, which
correlates with an increased flexibility in the side chain, lowering
the value of Tg.

With polymer samples 5c and 5f obtained
from reprecipitation, we moved on to evaluate their photophysical
properties. The polymers 5 also displayed PL characteristics
not only in dilute CH2Cl2 solution but also
in the solid state. In addition, the photophysical properties of polymers 5c and 5f in solution were similar to those of
the corresponding low-molecular-weight molecules 1c and 1f (Figure S43), and these polymers
bearing the luminescent partial structures of 1c and 1f in their side chains exhibited light-emitting properties
even in the solid state (Figure 5A). Comparison of the solid-state PL spectra for low-molecular-weight 1 and polymeric compound 5 indicated slight variations
in the maximum PL wavelengths and the spectral shapes. More specifically,
incorporation of the light-emitting unit into the polymer side chains
shifted the PL maximum wavelengths to longer wavelength regions (i.e.,
up to a 27 nm shift) and caused broadening of the spectral shape,
leading to a dramatic PL color change from deep blue for 1c and 1f to blue-white for 5c and 5f (see Figure 5B). Such dramatic changes in the solid-state PL behavior following
polymerization could be attributed to the formation of amorphous-like
molecular aggregation with various different intermolecular interactions.
In this case, the disordered amorphous aggregation is likely to cause
a significant decrease in the PL efficiency (ΦPL).

Figure 5 (A) Solid-state
PL spectra, (B) CIE color diagrams, and (C) TGA
thermograms of polymers 5c and 5f, and comparison
with the corresponding low-molecular-weight molecules 1c and 1f.

Subsequently, the thermal stabilities of 5c and 5f were evaluated by measuring their thermal decomposition
temperatures (Tdec) using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). On the basis of the TGA measurements, it was found
that polymerization contributed to a dramatic enhancement in the thermal
stability. More specifically, the Tdec values for polymers 5c and 5f were 245
and 272 °C, respectively, which are >90 °C higher than
the
corresponding values for 1c and 1f (Figure 5C). Taking into consideration
a previous report into thermal decomposition mechanism for alkynes,23 it appears that 1c and 1f also thermally decompose via the same mechanism, that is, the nth order of mechanism. Thus, one explanation for the dramatic
increase in Tdec for the polymers containing 1c or 1f moieties is that the main polymeric
chains encompass the alkyne moiety, and so a higher energy is required
to release the alkyne moiety from the polymeric aggregations. This
effect therefore rendered the development of novel solid-state light-emitting
molecules with higher thermal decomposition temperatures successful.

Conclusions
We herein reported the successful synthesis
of novel pentafluorinated
tolane derivatives via a facile manipulation from readily available
(4-alkoxyphenyl)acetylenes and disclosed their intriguing photophysical
behavior. More specifically, we found that the prepared pentafluorinated
tolane derivatives displayed PL characteristics both in dilute solutions
and in the solid state (i.e., crystalline aggregated structures).
These results indicate that the present fluorine-containing π-conjugated
molecules can be considered promising fluorophores for use in a range
of applications. It was of interest that the luminescent behavior,
for example, emission maximum, spectral shape, was dramatically changed
by incorporating the fluorescent moiety into the polymer side chain.
In addition, the incorporation of solid-state light-emitting molecules
into polymer side chains led to a dramatic enhancement in the thermal
stability by >90 °C, whereas maintaining the solid-state light-emitting
properties, although the luminescent efficiency was slightly reduced
because of disordered amorphous molecular aggregation. Our obtained
results therefore clearly demonstrate that the incorporation of functional
molecules into polymer side chains is promising for the development
of thermally stable functional materials. Thus, with the ultimate
aim of developing highly efficient and thermally stable solid-state
light-emitting materials, we are currently investigating the development
of light-emitting polymer materials bearing highly efficient fluorophores
in the side chain, and our results will be disclosed in due course.

Methods

1H and 13C NMR spectra
were obtained using an AVANCE III 400 NMR spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz and 13C: 100 MHz) in chloroform-d (CDCl3) (Bruker, Germany), and the chemical shifts are
reported in parts per million (ppm) based on the residual proton signal
of the NMR solvent. 19F NMR (376 MHz) spectra were obtained
using AVANCE III 400 NMR spectrometer in CDCl3 with CFCl3 (δF = 0 ppm) as an internal standard (Bruker,
Germany). IR spectra were recorded using the KBr method with FT/IR-4100
typeA spectrometer (JASCO, Japan); all spectra are reported in wave
numbers (cm–1). High-resolution mass spectra were
recorded on a JMS-700MS spectrometer (JEOL, Japan) using the fast-atom
bombardment (FAB) method.

commercial source; 4-ethynylanisole
(2a), p-ethynylpropoxybenzene (2c), p-bromoalkoxybenzene (3d–3f), and pentafluoroiodobenzene were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure
Chemical Corporation. 4-Ethoxyphenylacetylene (2b) was
available from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. A palladium catalyst,
that is, Cl2Pd(PPh3)2, was purchased
from Aldrich Fine Chemicals. PPh3, CuI, and AIBN were also
purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. THF used for
the radical polymerization was commercially available from FUJIFILM
Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, which was freshly distilled from sodium
benzophenone ketyl before use. Column chromatography was carried out
on silica gel (Wakogel 60N, 38–100 μm) and thin-layer
chromatographic (TLC) analysis was performed on silica gel TLC plates
(Merck, Silica gel 60F254). All reactions were carried
out using dried glassware and magnetic stirrer bars. Preparation of
the pentafluorinated tolanes was carried out according to the synthetic
procedure outlined in Scheme 1. Typical synthetic procedures of 1f from the
corresponding precursor 2f and the characterization data
are shown below as a selected example. Details of the synthetic methods
employed for 1a–1e, 5c, and 5f are described in the Supporting Information.

Typical Procedure for the Preparation of 2,3,4,5,6-Pentafluoro-1-[2-(4-hexyloxyphenyl)ethyn-1-yl]benzene
(1f)
In a 50 mL two-necked round-bottomed flask
was placed iodopentafluorobenzene (0.71 g, 2.4 mmol), Cl2Pd(PPh3)2 (0.056 g, 0.080 mmol), PPh3 (0.021 g, 0.080 mmol), CuI (0.017 g, 0.16 mmol), and Et3N (10 mL). To this solution was added 2f (0.33 g, 1.6
mmol) and Et3N (6.0 mL), and the resultant mixture was
heated at 60 °C for 17 h. After this process, the resultant precipitate
was separated by atmospheric filtration and the filtrate was poured
into a saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution. The crude product
was then extracted with AcOEt (×3), and the combined organic
layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator.
The resulting residue was subjected to column chromatography using
a mixed solvent (hexane/CH2Cl2 = 5:1) as the
eluent to produce 1f, which was further purified by recrystallization
from CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1) to give the desired product
as white solids in 61% yield (0.36 g, 0.97 mmol). mp 60 °C (determined
by DSC); 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 0.91 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 3H), 1.29–1.39 (m, 4H), 1.41–1.52
(m, 2H), 1.80 (quin, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 3.98 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 6.89 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H),
7.50 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H); 13C NMR (CDCl3): δ 14.0, 22.6, 25.7, 29.1, 31.6, 68.2, 71.8 (q, J = 3.6 Hz), 100.7 (tq, J = 19.7, 3.6 Hz),
102.1 (q, J = 2.1 Hz), 113.3, 114.7, 133.5, 137.6
(dtq, J = 251.6, 16.9, 2.9 Hz), 139.6–142.6
(dm, J = 256.0 Hz, 1C for C6F5), 147.0 (ddq, J = 256.7, 11.8, 4.4 Hz), 160.3; 19F NMR (CDCl3): δ −137.02 (dd, J = 21.8, 6.8 Hz, 2F), −154.10 (t, J = 20.3 Hz, 1F), −162.61 (ddd, J = 21.8,

X-ray Crystallography
Single crystals of the pentafluorinated
diphenylacetylenes (i.e., 1b and 1f) were
obtained by slow evaporation from a mixed solvent system (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 1:1) and were mounted on a glass fiber. All
measurements were carried out using a diffractometer with filtered
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71075 Å) and equipped with
a rotating anode generator using a VariMax with PILATUS/DW (Rigaku,
Japan). All calculations were performed using the CrysAlisPro software
package (Rigaku)24 and the refinement was
carried out using SHELXL-97.25 The structures
were solved by direct methods and expanded using Fourier techniques.
The crystal data are deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Center (CCDC) database (CCDC 1847249 for 1b and 1847250
for 1f).

Photophysical Properties
UV–vis
absorption spectra
were recorded using a JASCO V-500 absorption spectrometer (JASCO,
Japan). Steady-state PL spectra were obtained using a Hitachi F-7000
(Hitachi, Japan) or a JASCO FP-8500 fluorescence spectrometer (JASCO,
Japan). PL quantum yields were estimated using a calibrated integrating
sphere system.

Thermal Properties
Phase-transition
properties were
observed by polarizing optical microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope
(Olympus, Japan) equipped with a temperature-controlled stage (Instec
HCS302 microscope, hot and cold stages, and an mK1000 temperature
controller, Instec Inc. USA). The thermodynamic behavior of each compound
was determined using DSC [SII X-DSC7000 (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan)
or SHIMADZU DSC-60 Plus (Shimadzu, Japan)] at heating and cooling
rates of 5.0 °C min–1 for low-molecular-weight
molecules 1a–1f and 10 °C min–1 for polymers 5c and 5f. To evaluate the
thermal stabilities of these compounds, TGA was carried out using
a Discovery TGA (TA instruments, Japan) at a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1.

Computation
All DFT computations
were performed using
the Gaussian 09 (rev. C.01) program package.17 Geometric optimizations were executed using the CAM-B3LYP hybrid
functional and the 6-31+G(d) basis set with the implicit solvation
model, CPCM,18 for CH2Cl2. Excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and molecular
dipole moments for the optimized structures were calculated using
the TD-SCF method at the same level of theory. To obtain the structure
at the lowest excited (S1) state, optimization calculations
were executed using the same functional and basis set as those for
the structure obtained from the TD-SCF calculations.
