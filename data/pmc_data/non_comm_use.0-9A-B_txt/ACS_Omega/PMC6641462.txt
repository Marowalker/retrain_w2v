We
report the synthesis, structure, and adsorption properties of
two new metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) {[Cu2(bpp)3(L1)]·(bpp)·(4H2O)} (1) and {[Cu2(bipy)2(L2)(H2O)2]·(bipy)·(5H2O)} (2) obtained from two different flexible tetracarboxylate linkers
(L1 and L2) of variable lengths and flexibility.
While 1 comprising CuII, L1,
and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl) propane (bpp) is a 2D MOF with a cage-type
structure, 2 consisting of CuII, L2, and 4,4′-bipyridine (bipy) has a 3D twofold interpenetrated
structure. Both frameworks manifest permanent porosity, as realized
from CO2 adsorption at 195 K. 2 shows excellent
CO2/N2 and C2H2/C2H4 adsorption selectivity at 298 K. This has been
established by using 2 as a separating medium in a breakthrough
column for separating mixtures of CO2/N2 (15:85,
v/v) and C2H2/C2H4 (1:99,
v/v). The selectivity of 2 toward CO2 over
N2 and C2H2 over C2H4 is governed by favorable thermodynamic interactions owing
to its structural flexibility, unsaturated metal sites, and polar
carboxylate groups. Thus, 2 proves to be an extremely
efficient material for specific gas separation.

Introduction
Adsorptive separation1 of a particular
gas from a mixture using porous materials is a technique of supreme
importance in recent times because of its relevance in industrial
as well as environmental applications.2,3 Different gas
molecules are essential to sustain life4 as well as to cater to our various energy requirements.5 Thus, the effective sieving of the different
components of a gas mixture is of paramount importance.6 Hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene obtained
from natural and shale gases, are extremely important in the polymer
industry and to produce several other chemicals. During steam cracking
for the synthesis of ethylene, acetylene (about 1%) is usually produced
as a side product. This trace amount of acetylene is a contaminant
which, if not removed, acts as a catalyst poison in ethylene polymerization
and degrades the quality of the resultant polyethylene.7 Thus, the development of porous materials which
can facilitate selective adsorption of acetylene over ethylene is
of paramount importance as it can show a cost-effective facile route
for the challenging task of gas separation,7−9 thereby helping
the polymer industry immensely.

Metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs),10 well-known for their multifaceted
applications in gas storage,2,52 catalysis,11 luminescence,12 and
sensing properties,13,14 are extremely relevant in this
regard. MOFs are much more efficient,
both in terms of energy and cost, than traditional methods for gas
separation, for example, cryogenic distillation or partial hydrogenation.
Selectivity in MOFs can be achieved by tuning its pore size by modulating
the functionalities of the organic linker along with implementation
of suitable metal ions with varied geometry.15−17 By controlling
the window dimension or pore size of MOFs, kinetic-based separation
can be achieved.2,18,19 Also, separation can be done on the basis of favorable thermodynamic
interaction of the specific adsorbate molecules with the pore surface.8,20,21 Thus, it is extremely important
to adopt a proper targeted ligand design strategy to synthesize such
MOFs with high efficiency. Multidentate flexible linkers, for example,
di, tri, and tetra carboxylates,24−27,51 are the most widely used linkers in MOF chemistry.22,23 Such linkers coordinate with metal ions to form a wide range of
multinuclear nodes with predictable geometries such as binuclear paddle-wheel
units, tri, or tetranuclear units.25 In
this regard, aromatic tetracarboxylate linkers are particularly utilitarian
because of the more number of coordinating sites as well as the rich
π-electron density.25,27 MOFs constructed from
such π-electron-rich tetracarboxylate ligands have pore surfaces
studded with a large number of oxygen atoms providing better interactions
with gas molecules such as CO228,29 or small hydrocarbon molecules such as ethylene and acetylene.30,31 Furthermore, the flexibility of such ligands contributes to the
tunable porosity of MOFs by inducing guest-responsive structural dynamicity23,31,32,50 with the ability to respond to external stimuli,33 for example, temperature, pressure, light, electric fields,
and chemical inclusion.11,32 Such dynamic frameworks34 also manifest stepwise35 or gated adsorption36,37 at a certain pressure of an adsorbate
molecule38,39 which results in guest selectivity31,40 and gas separation.40−42

In this work, we have used two different flexible
tetracarboxylate
π-electron-rich linkers [5,5′-(1,4-(2-butene)bis(oxy)diisophthalic
acid (L1) and 5,5′-(1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(oxy)diisophthalic
acid (L2) (Scheme 1) of different lengths and flexibility. Self-assembly of L1 and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl) propane (bpp) with CuII at room temperature results in a hydrophobic 2D MOF {[Cu2(bpp)3(L1)]·(bpp)·(4H2O)} (1) (CCDC no. 1590169) with a cage43-type structure. The permanent porosity of the framework
has been established by performing CO2 adsorption at 195
K by different vapor adsorption studies. On the other hand, self-assembly
of L2 and bipyridine (bipy) with CuII resulted
in a twofold interpenetrated 3D MOF {[Cu2(bipy)2(L2)(H2O)2]·(bipy)·(5H2O)} (2) (CCDC no. 1590168). The desolvated framework
(2′) exhibits an excellent selectivity toward
C2H2 over C2H4 at 298
K, the practical applicability of which has been proven using a breakthrough
column experiment. Additionally, it is also a selective adsorbent
of CO2 from its mixture with N2, making it a
potential material for the separation for industrial flue gas. In
both cases, the basis of separation is the favorable thermodynamic
interaction of the framework with respective adsorbate molecules.

Results and Discussion
Description of the Crystal Structure of Compounds 1 and 2
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SCXRD)
data reveal that compound 1 crystallizes in a monoclinic P21/c space group. The asymmetric
unit contains two crystallographically independent penta-coordinated
CuII centers that have a (4 + 1) square pyramidal geometry.
The degree of deviation from ideal square pyramidal geometry has been
calculated in terms of Addison parameter (τ),44 the value of which is merely 0.019 for Cu1, suggesting
a square pyramidal geometry rather than a trigonal bipyramid. The
basal plane of Cu1 is occupied by N3 and N6 from two different bpp
linkers along with two carboxylate oxygen atoms O1 and O4 from two
different L1 linkers. The apical position is occupied
by the N1 atom from another bpp ligand (Figure 1a). The Cu1–O1 bond length at the
basal plane is 1.93(8) Å, whereas that for Cu1–O4 is 1.97(8)
Å. The bond lengths for Cu1–N3 and Cu1–N6 are 2.03(10)
and 2.04(14) Å, respectively. However, the Cu1–N1 bond
at the apical position is much longer with a bond length of 2.32(10)
Å, implying a (4 + 1) geometry. Similarly, the pentacoordination
of Cu2 is fulfilled by two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O5 and O7) from L1 and two nitrogen atoms (N4 and N5) from two different bpp
linkers at the basal plane and N2 at the apical position (Figure 1a). The τ value
for Cu2 is 0.13, suggesting high distortion from ideal square pyramidal
geometry. The bond lengths of Cu2–O5 and Cu2–O7 are
1.97(10) and 1.94(9) Å, respectively, whereas those of Cu2–N4
and Cu2–N5 are 2.03(12) and 2.04(12) Å, respectively.
The apical Cu2–N2 is much longer, with a bond length of 2.36(13)
Å. Cu1 and Cu2 are connected together by a bpp linker to form
a wavy chain (Figure 1b). Two such parallel chains are connected by an L1 linker,
where the two carboxylates at one terminal of L1 connect
two Cu1 atoms and the two carboxylates at the other terminal connect
two Cu2 atoms (Figure 1d). Adjacent to this, the Cu1 center is further diagonally connected
to a Cu2 atom in the other chain by a bpp linker. Thus, a 2D network
with a cagelike structure is formed containing a hydrophobic pocket
along the b direction (Figure 1d), which is lined by the π-electron-rich
aromatic L1 on one side and a bpp linker on the other.
This hydrophobic pocket houses a guest bpp molecule which forms a
π–π interaction with the pyridyl ring of the bpp
ligand on the wall of the pocket (cg–cg distance 4.6 Å).
The central C3 alkyl moiety in the case of both L1 as
well as bpp imparts flexibility to the pockets, thereby ensuring uptake
of adsorbate molecules in spite of the small pore size. All the guest
water molecules present in the framework, except for O5w, are hydrogen-bonded
with the framework. The hydrogen-bonding parameters of 1 have been summarized in Table S3. The
solvent accessible void space in the framework is 2943.3 Å3 (39.6% of the total cell volume), which has been calculated
using PLATON after removing the guest bpp and the water molecules.

pockets in the framework.

Compound 2 crystallizes in the C2/c monoclinic space group. Each asymmetric unit
comprises
two crystallographically independent pentacoordinated CuII centers, each of which assumes a distorted square pyramidal geometry,
the degree of distortion being as low as 0.007 for Cu1 and 0.037 for
Cu2. The pentacoordination of Cu1 is fulfilled by two nitrogen atoms
(N1 and N2) from two different bipy molecules, two oxygen atoms (O1
and O3) from tetracarboxylate linker L2, and one coordinated
water molecule (O7w). Similarly, the pentacoordination of Cu2 is satisfied
by two nitrogen atoms (N3 and N6) from two different bipy linkers,
two oxygen atoms (O5 and O12) from L2, and one oxygen
atom (O5w) from a coordinated water molecule. The bipy linker (containing
N6 and N7 atoms), connecting two adjacent Cu2 centers, is disordered
over two positions with 50–50 equal occupancy (Figure S5a). Cu1 centers connected by bipy linkers
form a 1D chain along the a direction, and a similar
1D chain is formed by the bridging of Cu2 centers by bipy along the
crystallographic a direction (Figure 2a). The two carboxylates on one terminal
of an L2 linker (marked in violet in Figure 2b) connect two of these parallel
chains on one plain (marked in dark green in Figure 2b). The two carboxylates on the other terminal
of the L2 connect two other such parallel 1D chains on
a different plain (marked in blue in Figure 2b) to form the 3D framework (Figure 2c). Two 3D frameworks interpenetrate
each other, resulting in a twofold interpenetrated 3D framework (Figure 2d). Along the crystallographic b direction, the single nets of the 3D framework contain
a 1D channel with a pore dimension of 4.45 × 5.46 Å2, which upon twofold interpenetration (Figures 2c and S3b) reduces
to a smaller channel having a pore dimension of 2.93 × 5.14 Å2, and the channel is occupied by guest bipy and guest water
molecules. Detailed analysis with TOPOS48,49 reveals that
compound 2 is the 5-nodal (2-c)(4-c)2(4-c)2 periodic net connected by two 4-connected (4-c) Cu centers,
by two 4-connected (4-c) L2 ligands, and one 2-connected
(2-c) bipy ligand. Further analysis shows that compound 2 adopts an unprecedented network topology with the Schlafli symbol
{62.72.8.9}2{63.7.82}{64.8.9}{64.82}2{7}. All the water molecules, except O4w, are hydrogen-bonded to
the framework, and the hydrogen bonding parameters have been summarized
in Table S6. The pyridyl ring (containing
the N4 atom) of guest bipy molecules shares a π–π
interaction (cg–cg distance 3.76 Å) with the pyridyl ring
(containing the N1 atom) of bipy linkers along the pore wall. As we
have discussed earlier, both Cu1 and Cu2 are coordinated to water
molecules, and thus, unsaturated metal sites (UMS) could be generated
after desolvation. The solvent accessible void is 5826.1 Å3 (47.5% of the total cell volume) and has been calculated
using PLATON after removing the coordinated and as well as guest water
and guest bipy molecules.

Framework Stability and
PXRD
The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of compound 1 shows an initial loss of
∼4%, corresponding to three guest water molecules (Figure S6a). Subsequently, there is a continuous
weight loss beyond ∼150 °C which may be attributed to
the loss of the remaining two guest water molecules and the guest
bpp molecule, which can be explained on the basis of SCXRD analysis.
Two of the guest water molecules are released at higher temperature.
Beyond 200 °C, the framework degrades continuously.

The
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized compound 1 matches perfectly with the simulated pattern, suggesting
the phase purity (Figure 3a). The framework on being desolvated undergoes structural
changes, as evident from the PXRD pattern of the framework desolvated
at 135 °C under vacuum (10–1 Pa). On desolvation,
there is rearrangement in the Bragg’s reflections, along with
peak broadening and appearance of new peaks, suggesting a structural
transformation.

The TGA of 2 shows
an initial loss of ∼9% up
to 100 °C owing to the loss of all 5 guest water molecules and
one of the coordinated water molecules (Figure S6a). The subsequent ∼13% loss starting at 140 °C
can be attributed to the loss of the second coordinated water molecule
and guest bipyridine molecules. The desolvated framework degrades
almost continuously beyond this.

The PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized
compound 2 is
in accordance with the simulated pattern. The structure of compound 2 shows changes with the increasing temperature, as evident
from the desolvated PXRD pattern (Figure 3b). This can be attributed to the removal
of the coordinated water molecules and the guest bipy molecules, which
interact with the framework via π–π stacking. The
removal of the bipy molecule gives rise to another structural phase.
In this framework, along with guest water molecules, there are coordinated
water molecules, and their removal results in the generation of UMS.
Such a change in the coordination sphere of the CuII center
ensues structural changes, as reflected from the PXRD pattern.

Gas and
Solvent Vapor Adsorption
Although compound 1 does not have a definite pore in any direction, the presence
of a pocket lined by electron rich aromatic benzene and pyridine rings
along the crystallographic b direction (Figure 1d) prompted us to
check the adsorption behaviour of the desolvated compound (1′). At 195 K, the adsorption isotherm of 1′ shows
an uptake of 35 mL g–1 CO2, with a steep
uptake in the low-pressure region. This can be attributed to the interaction
of the CO2 molecules with the free pendant carboxylate
oxygen atoms flanking the pore surface and the π-electron density
on the pore surface from the aromatic rings of the ligand (Figure 3c). The water adsorption
curve (Figure S7a) confirms the hydrophobic
nature of the framework exhibiting poor uptake at lower pressures,
which is also reiterated in the MeOH and EtOH adsorption isotherms
(Figure 3d). The net
adsorption amount decreases from water (2.7 Å) to methanol (3.6
Å) to ethanol (4.5 Å) as the kinetic diameter of the solvent
molecules increase in that order. The lower polarity of MeOH ensures
a steeper uptake at low pressures, as compared to water, but the net
uptake of water is much higher owing to its smaller size. Although
the hydrophobic MOF is expected to show a good adsorption of nonpolar
solvents such as benzene, the small pore dimensions of 1 restrict the adsorption of benzene (kinetic diameter of benzene
being 5.9 Å) (Figure S7a).

To
check the porous properties of compound 2, the N2 adsorption isotherm of the desolvated framework (2′) was measured at 77 K. 2′ does not adsorb N2, which is attributed to the high-diffusion barrier of the
inert N2 gas (kinetic diameter: 3.65 Å) in the narrow
channel of 2′ (2.93 × 5.14 Å2 along the b direction) (Figure 2d). Moreover, the accessible void space in
this framework is very small because of the twofold interpenetration.
However, framework 2′ manifests an appreciable
amount of CO2 uptake at 195, 273, as well as at 298 K.
At 195 K, 2′ records the adsorption of 127 mL
g–1 CO2, with a steep uptake in the low-pressure
region, indicating its microporous nature (Figure 3e). Steps are observed at various stages
of adsorption, which manifest that the framework is flexible in nature,
and there are different adsorption sites for CO2. Desorption
does not follow the same path as adsorption initially, and we observe
a hysteresis till P/P0 = 0.55, below which both the curves converge. The adsorption amount
of CO2 is 85 mL g–1 at 273 K and 65 mL
g–1 at 298 K. 2′ shows type-I
adsorption at 298 K where the adsorption and desorption curves do
not coincide, exhibiting a narrow hysteretic profile (Figure 3e). Besides the pendant oxygen
atoms on the pore surface, the presence of UMS, that is, pentacoordinated
CuII centers, along the pore further contributes to the
enhanced adsorption (Figure 2e). Also, the kinetic diameter of CO2 is smaller
(3.64 Å), and its high quadruple moment interacts with the π-electron
cloud of the aromatic rings on the pore surface. The polar hydrophilic
nature of the pore surface of 2′ is manifested
by the solvent adsorption profiles (Figures 3f and S5b). The
adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 273 and 298 K were fitted
in the virial equation, from which the isosteric heat of adsorption
(Qst,f) for 2′ was
calculated to be ∼18.9 kJ mol–1 at the zero
coverage region (Figure S10b).8

Intrigued by this, we proceeded to predict
the selectivity of 2′ toward CO2 over
N2 at 298
K using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. At 298 K for 2′, the predicted ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)45 selectivities of CO2 over N2 for a bimolar (0.15:0.85) mixture of CO2–N2 is 13. Also here, the selectivity increases with the increasing
pressure. At pressure 101 kPa, the CO2–N2 selectivity is 94 (Figure S9a).

Such a good theoretical value prompted us to check the actual separation
ability of 2 for CO2 gas from a binary CO2/N2 (0.15:0.85) mixture at room temperature (293
K). Tightly packed columns of 2′ (400 mg, column
length 4 cm) were prepared and activated with a He gas (flow rate
1 mL/min). The breakthrough curve of the binary mixture of CO2/N2 (0.15:0.85) for 2′ is represented
in Figure 4c, where
it exhibits a CO2 retention time of 11 min. This high retention
time indicates that 2′ holds immense potential
for practical use as a medium for separating CO2 from other
gases.

Figure 4 (a) CO2 adsorption isotherm at 298 K and N2 at 77 K for 2′. (b) Adsorption isotherms for
C2H2 and C2H4 at 293 K
for 2′. Breakthrough curves for a binary mixture
of (c) N2/CO2 (0.85:0.15) and (d) C2H2/C2H4 (0.1:0.99) for 2′.

Inspired by such efficiency of 2′ in separating
CO2 and N2, we were further interested in exploiting
the flexible structure and UMS for C2 [acetylene (C2H2) and ethylene (C2H4)] hydrocarbon storage
and separation. Thus, 2′ was checked for C2H2 and C2H4 adsorption, and
it was found that 2′ can adsorb 38 mL g–1 C2H2 at 273 K, whereas the adsorption amount
for C2H4 is 27 mL g–1 at 273
K (Figure S8). 2′ shows
a steeper uptake of C2H2 at lower pressure,
as compared to C2H4. At P/P0 = 0.01, the adsorbed amount of C2H2 per gram of 2′ is 11.5 mL when
the adsorbate is C2H2, whereas that for C2H4 is merely 5 mL. The desorption curve for C2H2 takes a different route than the adsorption
isotherm, thereby forming a hysteresis, indicating a strong interaction
between the framework and C2H2. At 293 K, the
adsorption amounts are 33 mL g–1 for C2H2 (Figure 4b) and 16 mL g–1 for C2H4. The isosteric heat of adsorption calculated for C2H2 is 32 kJ mol–1 at the zero coverage region
(Figure S8d,e). Thus, because of a higher Qst value, C2H2 attains
more accessibility to the pore surface and interacts with the UMS,
unlike C2H4. At 293 K, the predicted selectivity
of C2H2 over C2H4 for
a (0.01:0.99) mixture of the two gases is calculated in a similar
manner as for CO2–N2, using IAST,45 which is 3.7 initially, and the selectivity
decreases gradually with increasing pressure (Figure S9b). Thus, the easy accessibility to UMS coupled with
good IAST selectivity, high room-temperature uptake, and relatively
low heat of adsorption certifies that 2′ is an
ideal material for C2H2–C2H4 separation.

To establish the practical applicability
of 2 in separating
a trace amount of C2H2 from C2H4, we performed an actual breakthrough experiment where we
fed a column of 2′ with a (1:99, v/v) mixture
of C2H2 and C2H4 at 298
K. Interestingly, C2H4 appears within a few
seconds of starting the gas flow. The breakthrough time for C2H2 is 27 min (Figure 4d). This is a rather unique feat achieved
by any MOF at room temperature and aptly upholds the efficiency of 2 in real-time applications.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, two different flexible tetracarboxylate ligands L1 and L2 have been successfully implemented
in two different frameworks, 1 and 2, along
with other linkers. The variable flexibility and the aromatic π-electron-rich
nature of the ligands impart very interesting properties within the
framework. The presence of a hydrophobic pocket, lined by aromatic
rings from the ligand in compound 1, enables it to adsorb
a reasonable amount of CO2 at 195 K. On the other hand,
compound 2, with a 3D framework with twofold interpenetration,
is a promising adsorbent material owing to the presence of the polar
carboxylate groups, UMS, and flexible structure. It shows a good IAST
selectivity toward C2H2 over C2H4, which is culminated in practical applications using a breakthrough
column. 2′ can retain C2H2 for a very long time within this breakthrough column, releasing
pure C2H4. Moreover, 2′ also
manifests excellent CO2–N2 separation.
The selectivity of CO2 over N2 and C2H2 over C2H4 is attributed to more
favorable thermodynamic interactions. Thus, frameworks constructed
from such tetracarboxylate ligands can be used as effective materials
for specific gas sequestration and separation by tuning flexibility
and functionalities.

Adsorption Study
The adsorption isotherms of CO2 (195, 273 and 298 K) and N2 (77 K, 298 K), and
other gases (C2H2 and C2H4 at 273 and 298 K) using the desolvated sample of 1 (1′) and 2 (2′) were
measured by using a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ2 analyzer. In the sample
tube adsorbent, samples 1 and 2 (∼100–150
mg) were placed which had been prepared at 353 and 433 K, respectively,
under a 1 × 10–1 Pa vacuum for about 6 h prior
to the measurement of the isotherms. Helium gas (99.999% purity) at
a certain pressure was introduced in the gas chamber and allowed to
diffuse into the sample chamber by opening the valve. The amount of
gas adsorbed was calculated readily from the pressure difference (Pcal – Pe),
where Pcal is the calculated pressure
with no gas adsorption and Pe is the observed
equilibrium pressure. All operations were computer-controlled and
automatic.

The adsorption of different solvents such as MeOH
at 293 K and H2O and EtOH at 298 K was measured in the
desolvated sample of 1 and 2 in the vapor
state by using a BELSORP Aqua-3 analyzer. The samples of about ∼100–150
mg were activated under similar conditions as mentioned earlier. The
different solvent molecules used to generate the vapor were degassed
fully by repeated evacuation. The dead volume was measured with helium
gas. The adsorbate was placed into the sample tube, and then the change
of pressure was monitored and the degree of adsorption was determined
by the decrease in pressure at the equilibrium state. All operations
were computer-controlled and automatic.

Breakthrough Measurements
Breakthrough experiments
were performed using a column (packed with about 400 mg of powdered 2′), 4 cm long in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The
sample was first activated at 160 °C for 12 h prior to loading
in the column. After loading, the sample was again activated with
the He flow for 30 min. CO2/N2 (v/v 15:85 mixture)
and C2H2/C2H4 (v/v 1:99
mixture) streams were passed through the column with He. The flow
was continuous, and the flow rate was regulated by a Mass Flow Controller
(MFC). The partial pressure of the gas mixture was kept at p = 5 kPa. The gas stream at the outlet of the column was
analyzed on-line with gas chromatography. The space velocity was kept
at 4.71 min–1 (Figure S11).
