The
long-term interaction between Cu-based alloys and environmental
species gives rise to the formation of different and sometimes unusual
compounds (i.e., the patina) with distinctive chemical and structural
features as a function of the peculiar characteristics of the context.
In this paper, we describe some representative case studies concerning
degraded bronze Roman valuable or common use objects, and we show
that an attentive study at a microscale level, as for forensic analysis,
allows one to understand the chemical processes that underlie the
formation of the surface alteration products. The achieved information
describe fragments of chemical life and disclose the complex chemical
changes suffered by the artifacts, allowing one to write their chemical
biography. This challenging approach expands the panorama of available
information and demonstrates that it is possible to reconstruct the
different modes through which the bronze surfaces and interfaces have
interacted with environmental species, organic matter, and microorganisms,
opening up a new possibility to describe complex environmental chemical
stories, in certain cases interrelated.

Introduction
Cu-based alloys have
played a crucial role in the development of
human societies by contributing to the production of useful tools
and fascinating works of art and by fueling the progress of ancient
economy via their monetary use.1,2 With the passing of
time, during the long-term exposure to the environment (burial soil,
atmosphere, lake water, or seawater), the surface chemical composition
and often also the bulk features of the Cu-based alloys have been
substantially modified.1−9 Different types of reactions, in some case favored by microorganisms,
have given rise to the formation of distinctive corrosion products
and structures (i.e., the patina), sometimes unusual.10−12

The chemical and structural identification of the alteration
products
has been the subject of many studies for at least 180 years.1−3,13,14 The findings have revealed the formation of a wide panorama of copper,
tin, lead, arsenic, antimony, and zinc compounds such as oxides, hydroxides,
nitrates, chlorides, oxychlorides, carbonates, sulfates, sulfides,
phosphates, and other complex compounds including organic salts to
whose formation might have also contributed the microbially influenced
corrosion phenomena.1−3,9−11 These pieces of information reveal that the formation of the patina
and its chemical and structural features are largely influenced by
the chemical composition and metallurgical features of the alloy as
well as by the context characteristics.1−3 Indeed, the presence
of the above-cited mineral classes clearly demonstrates the strong
interaction among soil, atmosphere, or water components and Cu-based
alloy elements, giving rise to the formation of mineral species that
can form different structures via their accumulation or can be dissolved
in the environment or chemically altered to form new minerals by reacting
with environmental species.1−3,10,11

To describe thoroughly the structure
and the chemical composition
of the alteration products, some mechanisms have been proposed.1−3 These latter have been defined on the basis of detailed analytical
studies suggesting the role of the ion migration phenomenon3 even if in some cases the corrosion behavior
of archeological bronzes during soil or water burial has been not
always been properly understood as for some Cu-based artifacts retrieved
from seawater or freshwater or for the arsenical bronzes.2 The current understanding is therefore sometimes
limited, and these mechanisms could not be directly applicable to
the formation of specific corrosion products.1,2

For these reasons, an attentive study of the chemical and structural
features of the alteration products can throw new light on the environmental
conditions suffered by the artifacts and disclose fragments of their
chemical life, revealing the processes based on the interactions with
environmental inorganic or organic species.1−3,10,11 Similar to the forensic
investigation approach, the minute and systematic study of the patina’s
chemical and structural features at a microscale level helps us gain
further insight into the environmental contexts and to decipher in
whole or in part what happened in the course of time, enabling us
to write a sort of a “chemical biography” of the artifact.

In this paper, we describe some representative patinas naturally
grown on archeological objects found in Mediterranean sites characterized
by different environmental conditions. The objects are both commonly
used objects such as coins or small tools and important works of art
such as the over-life-size Dancing Satyr statue and a fragment of
an elephant statue, both retrieved from the Mediterranean Sea along
the southwestern coast of Sicily (Italy).

As for the forensic
analysis or the diagenetic process investigation,
we demonstrate that an attentive study of the corrosion products allows
us to achieve information otherwise impossible to obtain and to reconstruct
the different modes through which the bronzes have interacted with
environmental species, organic matter, and microorganisms, evidencing
that the case studies tell us basically chemical stories, sometimes
interrelated.

Materials and Methods
Archeological Bronzes
The small objects were investigated
in as-received conditions; in the case of large artifacts, small fragments
were carefully sampled also to achieve cross-sectioned materials to
investigate the structure of the corrosion product’s layer,
bulk chemical composition, and metallurgical features. To prepare
the cross sections, the small representative fragments were embedded
in epoxy resin for 24 h and sectioned by using a diamond saw to preserve
the microchemical structure and the surface features. Then, the sections
were polished with silicon carbide papers until 1200 grit; the final
polishing was performed with diamond pastes up to 0.1 μm.

Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy-Dispersive X-ray
Spectrometry (SEM–EDS) Analysis
The patinas were investigated
by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) Cambridge Stereoscan
360 (Cambridge, U.K.) and a high-brilliance and high-spatial-resolution
LEO Gemini 1530 (Zeiss, Germany) field emission scanning electron
(FE-SEM) microscope. SEM and FE-SEM instruments were equipped with
an INCA 250 and an INCA 450 (Oxford Instruments Analytical, U.K.)
energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), respectively, and four-sector
back-scattered electron (BSE) detectors. SEM micrograph images were
recorded in both secondary electron (SE) and BSE modes at an acceleration
voltage of 20 kV, whereas the FE-SEM images were recorded at different
acceleration voltages from 1 to 20 kV to better disclose the micromorphological
features of the bronze artifacts. Before the analysis, the surfaces
of the objects and the cross-sectioned samples were coated with a
thin layer of carbon or chromium to avoid charging effects induced
on the sample by the electron beam. The coatings were deposited by
using a Bal-Tech SCD 500 apparatus equipped with a turbo pumping system
for ultraclean preparations at a pressure of 5 × 10–3 mbar to produce a conductive film with a uniform thickness of about
1.0 nm.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Investigation
X-ray diffraction
patterns were recorded directly on the artifacts or a small amount
of powdered patina by a Siemens 5000 X-ray powder diffractometer with
Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) by using
the following experimental parameters: angular values between 10 and
90° in the additive mode, a step size of 0.05°, and a sampling
time of 20 s. X-ray diffraction patterns were analyzed by using electronic
databases and compared with the literature data.

Optical Microscopy
(OM) Study
OM morphological investigations
were performed by using Leica MZFLIII and Leica LAS multifocus stereo
microscopes equipped with a digital camera (Leica DFC 320). The metallurgical
features have been studied by means of a Leica MEF IV optical microscope
equipped with a 420 Leica digital camera.

Results and Discussion
Corrosion products are naturally formed on archeological and historical
Cu-based alloys during the long-term chemical interaction between
alloy elements and environmental species present in burial soil, seawater,
lake marsh sediments, or the atmosphere.1−9 As a consequence of the corrosion phenomena, the surface and also
the bulk chemical and structural features are changed (Figure 1), in certain cases substantially,
producing a wide panorama of mineral species including carbonates,
chlorides, sulfates, sulfides, oxides, and other, sometimes unusual,
corrosion products.10,11 These latter can be differently
structured (Figure S1) assuming various
configurations, that is, the patina, sometimes well ordered and stratified
or forming complex aggregations as more frequently observed.1,3,12

Figure 1 Descriptive example of a corroded archeological
bronze artifact
(first row, Nile Delta region, Egypt) showing the presence of a complex
patina composed by azurite [Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2], malachite [Cu2CO3(OH)2], cuprite (Cu2O), and cassiterite (SnO2) with calcareous encrustation, with participation also of phosphate
species produced by decomposing bones found in close contact with
the artifact. The second and third rows show a small selection of
different patinas that can grow on Cu-based Roman coins during the
long-term burial in the soil. The different colors reflect the presence
of various mineral phases whose formation depends on the chemical
composition of the Cu-based alloys but even more on the nature of
the soil or sediments with which the coins have interacted for about
two thousand years.

The chemical nature and
the structure of the corrosion products
strictly depend on the alloys’ chemical composition and metallurgical
features1,7,15−17 and, particularly, on the microenvironmental conditions experienced
by the alloys.1−3,10,11,18,19 Similar to the approach adopted for the forensic analysis or the
diagenetic process investigation, the microscale attentive study of
the degradation products could provide the possibility of identifying
which kind of environmentally driven chemical experiences the objects
have lived through, in many cases for more than two thousand years,
giving us the possibility of writing in whole or in part their chemical
“biography”.

This approach could open new challenging
possibilities to reconstruct
the past environment and to figure out what happened from a chemical
and a structural point of view to these witnesses of the ancient technology
and creativity.

The case studies here presented have been selected
from a large
number of bronze archeological artifacts retrieved from the Mediterranean
basin area that have been investigated to identify degradation agents
and mechanisms and to select tailored and long-lasting strategies
for their safe conservation and sustainable fruition.

The archeological
bronze objects have been found in different sites
and are mainly commonly used objects such as coins and small artifacts
but may also include relevant artworks such as the fascinating Dancing
Satyr statue and a fragment of an elephant statue retrieved from the
Channel of Sicily (Italy).

The first case study describes the
corrosion products naturally
grown on a Roman coin (likely issued in the 2nd–3rd century
AD) found during the periodic cleaning and dredging operations on
the beds and banks of the Tiber river in the area of the Cloaca Maxima
in Rome (Italy), which is one of the earliest sewage systems to convey
surface runoff, to drain local marshes, and to remove the waste of
one of the most populous cities of the ancient world.

In this
area, the soil of the riverbeds and banks contains stratified
heterogeneous fluvial sediments including the materials picked up
by the Tiber river and its tributaries along their ways.20 The sediments are composed of a complex mixture
of rotting organic matter, lithoid tuff, anthropic inorganic materials,
mud, silt, lacustrine, and fluvial-palustrine sandy clay. These latter
contain micalike minerals, chlorite, kaolinite, smectite, limestone
gravel, and clayey and marine sands with quartz, feldspars, and calcite
whose contents vary as a function of area and flooding events as evidenced
by Bozzano et al.21−23 These works report some sediment compositions even
though evidence of the lithological setting of the alluvial deposits
of the Tiber river is still scarcely defined due to the lack of suitable
outcrops and the large heterogeneity of the sediments.

The coin
under study is almost completely coated with a bright
sky-blue patina containing turquoise [CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4(H2O)] (Figures 2 and S2), which is appreciated as an enchanting natural gemstone used since
thousands of years to produce jewels and ornaments owing to its unique
hue. As revealed by EDS and XRD results (Figures 2 and S2), cassiterite
(SnO2) and a small amount of Pb(IV)-based compounds are
also present on the surface of the coin.

Figure 2 Roman coin with a blue
patina containing turquoise [CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4(H2O)], a hydrated copper-aluminum
phosphate, mixed with cassiterite
(SnO2).

The presence of SnO2 is frequently observed on archeological
bronzes, and it has been explained taking into account the process
of Cu selective dissolution causing a Sn surface enrichment with its
incorporation into the patina.1,3,18,24,25 This process often creates an outermost stable layer often pseudomorphically
retaining the original morphology of the artifact. The formation of
a SnO2 layer, identified also via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
measurements,26,27 is related to both the environmental
mobilities of Cu1+ and Cu2+ ions and to the
stability of SnO2 over a wide range of pH values.

The presence of Pb(IV)-based compounds is related to the common
use of a low-cost leaded bronze to produce coins.21 In this kind of alloy, the very scarce solubility of lead
in the copper at room temperature and vice versa leads to the formation
of small Pb aggregates,1,10,27,28 randomly scattered in the copper matrix,
that are preferentially mineralized (galvanic coupling) and that participate
in the formation of the patina as a function of the available environmental
anions.1,8−10,18

The presence of a complex copper phosphate is of great interest
because, to the best of our knowledge, an archeological patina containing
turquoise has been not yet been described in the literature.1,2 More generally, as pointed out by Scott,1,2 copper
phosphates are rarely found as corrosion products except in characteristic
environments, primarily in association with buried decomposing bones
releasing phosphate anions10 and in arid
climates.

Although the locus of finding of the coin, that is,
the Cloaca
Maxima area, is not arid, surely a consistent presence of phosphates
in this area is conceivable due to the large amount of waste materials
found here, including P-containing bones.

How was the formation
of a hydrated copper-aluminum phosphate on
the coin possible? The answer is, likely in a manner similar to that
naturally occurring in the geological process. The turquoise gemstone
is a secondary mineral generally formed in alluvial deposits by the
percolation of acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and
oxidation of Cu-sulfide-bearing rocks with the incorporation of phosphorus
from phosphate-containing waters or leached fluids that have interacted
with phosphates as apatite, Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH), with the contemporaneous presence of Al ions deriving
from feldspatic rocks or clayey sediments.29,30

The hypothesis that the weathering and the oxidation of Cu-sulfides
were one of the chemical steps for the formation of a turquoise-containing
patina is supported by the finding in the same area of some Roman
coins almost completely coated by a smooth and adherent gold-like
brilliant metal sulfide layer (Figures 3 and S3). The microchemical
results reveal that their patina is mainly constituted by chalcopyrite
crystals (CuFeS2) as revealed by XRD results and whose
EDS analysis matches very well the theoretical stoichiometric elemental
values for CuFeS2.

Figure 3 OM image and XRD pattern of the surface of a
Roman coin characterized
by a smooth and adherent gold-like brilliant layer partially spotted
with black-brownish or white microareas. The XRD results reveal that
the patina is composed by chalcopyrite (CuFeS2).

The formation of a copper or copper-iron
sulfide on a buried bronze
object reveals the metabolic activity of sulfidogenic and nonpathogenic
microorganisms,10,11,31,32 that is, the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs).
These latter transform in corroding H2S the sulfate species
present in an anaerobic humus-rich soil with decomposing organic
matter thus giving rise to a degradation process defined as microbially
influenced corrosion (MIC).31,32 This latter process
produces a biofilm capable of modifying drastically the microenvironment,
forming copper sulfides or chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). It is
worth noting that the presence of chalcopyrite has been rarely detected
on archeological bronzes almost always retrieved from lake or river
sediments.8,32 Less rarely, copper sulfides such as covellite
(CuS), digenite, (Cu5S9), chalcocite (Cu2S), or djurleite (Cu1.96S) have been found on bronze
objects buried in seawater or in lake sediments probably due to different
local microenvironmental conditions.8,32

The
inclusion of Fe3+ ions in the sulfide corrosion
product is not related to the chemical composition of the coin alloy,
which does not consistently contain Fe, but is related to Fe-containing
compounds locally available in the surrounding microenvironment as
Fe-corroding masses.10,11 In a soil rich in organic matter
and in an almost oxygen-free environment, copper ions from the coin,
hydrogen sulfide produced by SRBs, and Fe3+ ions, likely
from contiguous corroding iron objects, can coprecipitate on the bronze
object as a uniform layer of chalcopyrite as in this case study.

Although the mechanism by which the CuFeS2 was formed
on the Roman copper-based coins is not exactly known,8,31,32 the presence of a brilliant and
well-crystallized chalcopyrite layer, whose thickness ranges from
80 to 110 μm, suggests that the local microenvironmental conditions
remained constantly favorable for the chalcopyrite formation up to
the present days.

Some of these CuFeS2-patinated
coins remained under
these pristine anaerobic conditions until their discovery, but some
others could have been removed from the primary burial context likely
by a wastewater stream or a flood, thus changing their local environmental
conditions that become oxidizing, giving rise to a topotactic transformation.2 As a consequence of this variation, the resulting
oxidized product reacting with environmental phosphate anions and
Al3+ from the burial soil has formed the turquoise mineral.

The presence of a low amount of sulfur and iron in the turquoise-containing
patina, revealed by EDS spectrum A (Figure S2), can be interpreted as a survival presence or a relic of the primary
sulfide, thus confirming the above-described hypothesis of turquoise
formation. It is worth noting that a similar reaction has been proposed
as one possible cause for the formation of brochantite on archeological
objects during burial caused by the oxidation of the copper sulfides
previously grown on the artifact,33 under
an anaerobic, waterlogged burial environment.

Another finding
that supports the proposed mechanisms is the large
presence of reactive phosphate anions in the soil of the Cloaca Maxima
area as documented by the discovery in the same site of some leaded-bronze
objects coated by a pale green-bluish patina whose main component
is pyromorphite [(PbCl)Pb4(PO4)3]
(Figure 4). This latter
corrosion product is formed from the long-term interaction between
the lead of the bronze objects and the phosphate-containing soil produced
by the decay of organic matter, likely from the dissolution of bones
during burial.

Figure 4 OM image and XRD pattern of the surface of a Roman object
found
at the Cloaca Maxima area and characterized by a patina mainly constituted
by pyromorphite [(PbCl)Pb4(PO4)3].

Pyromorphite has been in fact
observed on leaded-bronze objects
found at Tharros (Sardinia, Italy) in an area where a large number
of fragments of decomposing sheep bones was present.10 It is worth pointing out that the patina of these bronzes
contains only a small amount of copper likely due to the more relevant
preferential corrosion of the less noble lead dispersed in the copper
matrix. Copper phosphates like libethenite [Cu2(PO4)(OH)] or cornetite [Cu3(PO4)(OH)3] could be also formed on lead-free bronze artifacts always
associated with decomposing buried bones and other organic or inorganic
P-containing materials.2

The three
above-described case studies describe specific bronze
corrosion products, that is, turquoise [CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4(H2O)], chalcopyrite
(CuFeS2), and pyromorphite [(PbCl)Pb4(PO4)3], and disclose some possible chemical interrelated
vicissitudes suffered by the archeological bronzes during their long-term
burial.

These examples evidence that different microenvironments
can be
identified in the same area by attentive investigations that can reveal
the complex interaction between the artifact and the surrounding microcontext,
the consequence of which is the formation of different distinctive
mineral species.

More specifically, the formation of turquoise,
chalcopyrite, and
pyromorphite can be related to the presence of a large amount of available
phosphorus in the archeological context from a sewage system and of
sulfide anions produced by SRB bacteria in an almost oxygen-free environment,
thus confirming in some way what was written in 1605 AD by Yuan Hongdao,
a Chinese poet of the Ming Dynasty (1568–1610 AD), “bronzes
that have been in the soil a long time are deeply impregnated with
the essence of the earth”.2,34

Another
example of the interaction between the burial environment
and a bronze artwork is provided by the microchemical results achieved
from the study of the patina grown on the Dancing Satyr, an over-life-size
statue of a nude satyr in a whirling pace of dance in honor of the
god Dionysus. This statue was retrieved by fishermen about 20 years
back from the seawater of the Channel of Sicily (Italy) at a presumed
depth of about 500 m, where it was arduous to identify the environmental
conditions.35

The Dancing Satyr in
as-received conditions showed large areas
characterized by a dark-brown patina whose cross-sectioned chemical
structure is shown by an SEM image and EDS elemental chemical maps
(Figure 5). These latter
highlight the presence, among other elements, also of a thin layer
of vanadium, tin, and magnesium under an external thick layer containing
iron. The presence of vanadium could appear unusual and has surely
an environmental provenance being absent even in minute traces in
the bronze alloy. Furthermore, V cannot be precipitated from metal-corroding
masses surrounding the bronze statue because this element is absent
in the alloys used in ancient times;36−38 then, the possible provenance
could be only geochemical or biological.1−3

Figure 5 BSE–SEM image
and EDS elemental chemical maps of Cu, Pb,
V, Mg, Sn, Fe, and O of the cross-sectioned dark-brown patina grown
on the Dancing Satyr. The elemental maps disclose the unusual presence
of vanadium.

The first hypothesis
can be ruled out because vanadium has been
found in the patina of some bronze artifacts retrieved from other
underwater Italian areas of Sardinia and Sicily (Figure 6) as well as along the Croatian
coast, being observed also on the Appoxiomenos statue.39,40

Figure 6 BSE–SEM
image and EDS elemental chemical maps of V, Pb,
Cu, and Sn of the cross-sectioned patina grown on a fragment of a
bronze elephant leg retrieved from the Channel of Sicily (Italy).
The EDS spectrum and the elemental map in area A reveal the noticeable
presence of vanadium.

The second hypothesis is more convincing because V has been
found
in numerous marine organisms as chromagen proteins and active centers
of enzymes41−43 and has an important role in different biological
systems43−48 as in the blood cells of tunicates like the ascidians or immobile
marine invertebrate permanently attached to rocks or other substrates.41−48

These latter are colonizing microorganisms that feed by filtering
seawater and accumulate vanadium in the blood to a very high level
with respect to the surrounding seawater (1–30 mg/L) even though
the reason of this unusual ability remains a biological mystery.41−48

The presence of vanadium in the patina can be explained by
the
long-term colonization by ascidians on the surface of the bronze statue
and its accumulation as a consequence of their life cycles. At the
moment of their death, the decay process of the organic matter releases
V that can be partially incorporated by the bronze corrosion products
likely as a mixed oxide with lead.44−48 The significant colonization by microorganisms onto
the surface of the Dancing Satyr is supported by the presence of many
fossilized relics embedded into the patina (Figure S4).

The presence of unexpected elements in the patina
reveals the capture
not only of anions from the environment but also of metal ions as
a result of the chemical interaction with the alloying elements as
demonstrated by the presence of the schoenfliesite [MgSn(OH)6] in the patina of the Dancing Satyr or other bronze artifacts retrieved
from the Mediterranean Sea as shown by XRD results (Figure S5). Schoenfliesite is produced by the interaction
between the Sn cations from the corroding bronze and Mg2+ from the marine environment that gives rise to the formation of
a mixed hydroxide.

Other interesting information about the chemical
life of an object
can be provided by the attentive analysis of the outermost layers.
For example, the presence of the ferruginous thick layer on the dark-brown
patina of the Dancing Satyr (Figure 7) can be related to a drastic variation of the microenvironmental
chemical conditions. This change caused the deposition of iron species,
the curbed formation of schoenflesite, and a significant reduction
of feeding for the ascidians, thus hindering their growth and multiplication.
One possible hypothesis could be the restriction of water circulation
around the statue and a high local concentration of iron ions provoked
by neighboring corroding masses that cause the deposition of an iron
oxide-hydroxide layer. Likely, the Dancing Satyr statue was initially
placed on the wood deck of the ship; then, some centuries later as
a consequence of the wood decomposition and structure collapse, the
statue sank into the ship’s hold where it was exposed to different
microenvironmental conditions more biologically hostile where iron
masses were corroding. This hypothesis is supported by observing in
details the corrosion products grown on the hair of the Dancing Satyr
that discloses the cellular wood structure likely of the ship’s
deck that has survived the deterioration being in contact with the
copper biocidal corrosion products (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Details of the head of the Dancing Satyr coated
by a ferruginous
dark-brown patina and FEG–SEM image of the patina present on
some areas of the hair. The FEG–SEM image reveals the cellular
structure of the wood of the ship deck where the statue was initially
placed during its transportation.

These findings reveal that the interaction of the bronze
artifact
with the surrounding microenvironment can include also the chemical–physical
incorporation of inorganic species capturing soil minerals or organic
matter such as insects, textiles, feathers, wood, bones, and leather
whose structure and morphology can be preserved in some way as a consequence
of their mineralization.2,19

Due to the biocidal
character of copper ions, the organic natural
or man-made materials can be preserved or most frequently can be pseudomorphically
replaced. A highlighting example is shown by the surface of a bronze
Carthaginian coin (Figures 8 and S6) placed on a human body
buried in a grave at Ras Zebib (Tunisia 3rd century BC). The coin
was placed inside a garment at the chest height, and the textile material
(wool) was replaced by the copper corrosion products participating
in a pseudomorphic substitution likely during the initial corrosion
period of burial, thus forming a negative cast of the fibers.2,19,49

Figure 8 SEM image of the copper corrosion products
formed on a bronze Carthaginian
coin placed at the chest height of a buried human body. The image
shows the typical structure of the wool fibers of a garment pseudomorphically
replaced by Cu corrosion products.

As in this case study, the careful investigation of the micromorphological
details allows one to reveal the presence of embedded organic materials,
sometimes fossilized, or their imprint, allowing the identification
of the textile nature and of the fibers’ size besides providing
valuable information, otherwise difficult to obtain, about the twisting
process to form the textile.

Finally, we point out that the
detailed micro- and nanochemical
and morphological information can be useful to investigate in details
the material nature of ancient works of art50 and also can be used to select the most appropriate procedures for
conservation. These latter can utilize innovative materials and approaches
based on the emerging nanotechnologies that are under study also for
bronze conservation after having been already successfully used to
contrast the degradation of other classes of artworks.51−53

Conclusions
The surface of archeological Cu-based alloy
artifacts found in
different contexts has been investigated by adopting an attentive
approach aimed at identifying the ancient environmental conditions
experienced over time by the objects.

The results highlight
the relevance of the minute microchemical
and morphological investigations of the corrosion products grown on
archeological bronzes during their long-term burial too often wholly
ignored in their scientific study.1−3,11,19,49

The case studies here described emphasize how the interaction
between
alloy elements and environmental chemical species, microorganisms,
and materials can change the surface and subsurface chemical and structural
features in many different ways that can be revealed by detailed investigations
carried out at a microscale.

The results can greatly extend
and supplement the possibilities
presently afforded for example by Pourbaix’s diagrams that
represent only the possible presence of a stable phase as a function
of the electrochemical potential and the pH values in an aqueous system,
but which are also highly influenced by the presence of certain reactive
species such as chloride ions. Moreover, particular burial corrosive
environments can be disclosed in details, thus contributing to explain
the formation of unusual mineral phases.

According to this approach,
the microscale study of the interaction
products should be carefully performed prior to cleaning and conservation
procedures, thus contributing to identifying the ancient environmental
conditions and their eventual changes over time and to decipher what
had taken place on the surface of the cultural heritage artifacts.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that this approach could be of
interest to a large number of researchers of different disciplines
including materials science, chemistry, environment, and geology,
stimulating new tailored research, and it could provide the opportunity
to write, in whole or in part, a sort of a chemical biography of these
fascinating witnesses of human art, creativity, and technology.
