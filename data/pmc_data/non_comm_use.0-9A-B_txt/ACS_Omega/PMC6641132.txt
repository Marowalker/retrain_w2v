1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO)-based ionic liquids (ILs) 2–4 were synthesized
by the N-alkylation of DABCO using
alkyl halides of varying chain lengths (C2, C5, and C7). The N-alkylated DABCO-ILs were mixed with polyethylene
glycols (PEGs) of varying molar masses as hydrogen bond donors (HBDs)
to prepare new deep eutectic solvents (DESs). These DABCO–PEG-based
DESs were successfully employed for the synthesis of a variety of
indoles 7a–7h (by Fischer indole synthesis) and
1H-tetrazoles 9a–9i (by click
chemistry). For comparison, DESs of DABCO-ILs with different alcohols
(as HBD) were also prepared and investigated for the synthesis of
indoles. Although comparable yields were observed in DES-containing
alcohols and PEGs, the use of PEG as HBD in DES (as an alternative
to alcohols) provides a much safer, nonvolatile, and environmentally
benign reaction medium for synthetic reactions. The first successful
application of PEG-polymer-based DES as benign reaction media for
organic syntheses offers exciting opportunities to be explored in
the realm of green synthesis.

==== Body
1 Introduction
One
of the milestones to be achieved in the green synthetic chemistry
is geared toward the efforts to minimize hazardous impact of volatile
solvents on the environment.1 One of the
greatest challenges in this regard is the substitution of obnoxious
volatile solvents with green, environment-friendly, nontoxic, and
nonvolatile reaction media. Introduction of ionic liquids (ILs) as
an environment-friendly medium for organic reactions has been a major
step in this direction.2 Important properties
of ILs in this context include low volatility, high thermal stability,
efficient recyclability, and nonflammability.1a,3 A
variety of synthetic reactions have been reported in ILs where they
act as both solvents and catalysts.4 The
most widely used ILs for organic syntheses are those based on imidazole
or pyridine.1a,5 However, the inertness of imidazole6 and the toxicity of pyridine hamper their use
for the synthesis of drugs and other bioactive molecules because they
require major postsynthesis purification and separation steps. Moreover,
they have a single functionalized nitrogen atom to act as a catalyst.
On the other hand, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is endowed
with two active nitrogen atoms. Because DABCO exists in a solid form,
it offers ease of handling and is also significantly less toxic than
pyridine. DABCO serves as a catalyst in many organic transformations
such as ring opening of aziridine with amines or thiols, synthesis
of quinoxalines, and so forth.7 Hasaninejad
et al. reported the use of silica-bonded n-propyl-4-aza-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
chloride (SB-DABCO) as a catalyst to perform the three-component reaction
for the synthesis of 4H-benzo[b]pyran
derivatives.8 In some recent studies, a
complex of DABCO–palladium supported on silica or polymer has
been used to catalyze cross-coupling reactions, that is, Suzuki–Miyaura
and Mizoroki–Heck reactions.9

In the present study, DABCO was functionalized by the reaction
with alkyl halides to obtain the corresponding N-alkylated quaternary
ammonium salts (or ILs) (2–4). Furthermore, the
DABCO-based ILs were mixed with hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) to develop
novel deep eutectic solvents (DESs). The DESs can be considered to
be unique type of ILs, where the individual solid components, when
mixed together in a specific ratio, undergo a significant depression
in the melting point resulting in a low melting (eutectic) mixture.10 The HBD component of the DES plays an important
role in this depression of melting point. Physiochemical properties
of DES, such as nontoxicity, nonvolatility, biodegradability, and
recyclability, are similar to those of ILs.11

The DESs are an excellent substitute of traditional organic
solvents
in synthetic organic chemistry.10a Herein,
the use of polymers [polyethylene glycol (PEG)] as HBD to formulate
DESs for indole and 1H-tetrazole synthesis is reported
for the first time. Numerous mono- and polyhydric alcohols (typical
HBDs) are used to compare the efficiency of polymer-based DESs. Comparative
yields of 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole (indole) 7a with PEG as HBD are presented in Table 1. The application of PEGs in DES as HBD provides
safer, environment-friendly, and nonvolatile reaction media for organic
synthesis. ILs and HBDs are associated with each other via hydrogen-bonded
interactions in DESs.10

2 Results
and Discussion
DABCO-based ILs 2–4 were
prepared via simple
N-alkylation with different alkyl (C2, C5, and
C7) halides (Scheme 1). Structures of the prepared ionic salts were confirmed with
different spectroscopic techniques including infrared (IR), proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and mass spectrometry.
The synthesized DABCO-based ionic salts (2–4)
were mixed and heated with HBDs (alcohols or PEGs of varying molar
masses) to form melts as DESs, which were utilized for Fisher indole
and 1H-tetrazole synthesis.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of DABCO-Based
Ionic Liquids 2–4
Fisher indole synthesis in pyridine- or imidazole-based
ILs has
been reported.12 Recently, König
et al. have described the Fisher indole synthesis in the low melting
mixture of tartaric acid/dimethyl urea (3:7) as DES.13 In this study, we report DABCO-based new ILs 2–4 that were mixed with methanol, a common HBD source, to prepare DESs
for the Fisher indole synthesis. The percentage yield of indole 7a in DABCO-ILs 3 and 4 was good
(entry number 1–3, Table 1). Comparable yields of indole 7a were
obtained for the reaction in PEG-based DES (Table 1). Moreover, the synthesis of indole 7a was also carried out by using alone DABCO-based ILs 3 and 4. The percentage yield of indole 7a obtained by performing the reaction at 80 °C up to
2.5 h in DABCO-ILs 3 and 4 was 50 and 56%,
respectively. The formation of indole 7a in ethanol,
as the solvent, without any catalyst was found to be 47%. These results
show the significant importance of DES melts (Table 1) as a solvent to preform indole formation.
The use of PEG as an HBD source in DESs offers safer, nonvolatile,
and environmentally benign reaction media (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Indoles in DABCO-IL-Based
DESs
DABCO-IL 3 (1,4-dipentyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium
bromide) was used as a model IL to prepare DESs with a range of different
alcohols and PEGs (as HBDs) in the molar ratio of 1:2 (Table 2). These model DESs were employed
as the medium to act as solvents and catalysts simultaneously for
the Fisher indole reaction. The yield of indole 7a was
comparatively less in low boiling alcohols (entries 1–5, Table 2) compared to that
in the high boiling alcohols (entries 6–10, Table 2). However, isolation of the
product from the DES of high boiling alcohols was slightly difficult
and tedious. DESs based on butanol (entry 4, Table 2) or hexanol (entry 5, Table 2) proved to be a better compromise owing
to their less volatility and easy removal of alcohol during purification
(Table 2). Moreover,
the use of diols, triols, and polyols (entries 11–19, Table 2) as the HBD component
in DESs resulted in comparable yields of indole 7a. The
major advantages of the use of diols, triols, and polyols as HBDs
include less volatility and easy removal via facile aqueous workup
of the reaction mixture.

Table 2 DABCO-Based Ionic
Salts in Combination
with Various HBDs for the Fisher Indole Synthesis of 7a
The use of PEG of the varying molar mass, as a substitute
for traditional
HBD source, provides a nonvolatile and less toxic reaction medium,
an imperative aspect for green chemistry. Employing PEG as HBD in
DES melts as the reaction media in the synthesis is unprecedented
(entries 20–29, Table 2), to the best of our knowledge. IL 3 was mixed
with PEGs of different molar masses to form DES melts that were then
explored for their scope in the synthesis of indole 7a (Table 2). The highest
yield was obtained in the DES based on IL 3 and PEG400 (entry 21, Table 2), which was comparable to that obtained in IL–alcohol
melt (entry 4, Table 2). The yield of indole decreased with increasing molar mass of PEG
used in DES preparation (i.e., entries 23, 25, and 27). This decrease
was most significant for PEG20000- and PEG40000-based DES. High molar mass polymers were also difficult to remove
from the reaction mixture.

The scope of polymer-based DES was
explored by carrying out the
synthesis of various substituted indoles (7a–7f, Figure 1). In this
regard, a mixture of DABCO-IL 3 and PEG400 as DESs was used as a model reaction medium to carry out the reactions
between different substituted phenyl hydrazines and cyclohexanone
to form the corresponding substituted indoles 7a–7f (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Synthesis of
substituted 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole (indoles) 7a–7f or indolenine 7g, 7h in DABCO-IL-based DES melt.

The reaction of cyclohexanone with 4′-methoxy-substituted
phenyl hydrazine proceeded smoothly in DABCO-based DES (entry 22, Table 2) to give indole 7b in excellent yield (83%). However, the yield of indole 7c (60%) dropped with 4′-cyano (−CN)-substituted
phenyl hydrazine, possibly because of the electron-withdrawing effect
of the −CN group. Moreover, the yields of the indoles 7d (62%) and 7e (50%) were relatively less because
of the presence of chloro and methyl substituents at the ortho position
that resulted in significant hindrance in a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement
to furnish the corresponding indoles. The reaction of cyclohexanone
with 4′-fluoro-substituted phenyl hydrazine also gave excellent
yield (84%) (Figure 1). The reaction between l-menthol and phenyl hydrazine was
also performed in the newly developed DABCO-IL-based DES to get the
corresponding indole. The product obtained in l-methanol
was identified as indolenine rather than indole and is in agreement
with the previous reports.14 The requisite
cyclization to furnish tricycle ring system occurs at isopropyl-substituted
carbon to form indolenine 7g as the major isomer and 7h as the minor isomer.14 The formation
of such a hindered and substituted product confirms the validity of
new catalytic DES melts for its application as safe and green reaction
media for organic syntheses.

Tetrazole is a biologically active
molecule. There are many pharmaceutically
important molecules15 that contain a tetrazole
moiety and exhibit diverse biological applications and improved pharmacokinetic
properties.16 Click reaction for the formation
of 1H-tetrazole via [2 + 3]nitrile–azide coupling
has emerged as a powerful synthetic approach in organic synthesis.
Since the advent of this reaction by Demko and Sharpless,17 a wide range of different reagents/reaction
media have been utilized for this reaction.18 In the current study, we employed a novel DES, mixture of DABCO-IL 3 and PEG400, for click reaction leading to the
synthesis of 1H-tetrazole. A typical reaction between p-methoxy benzonitrile and sodium azide was conducted in
DES at high temperature (118–121 °C). Sodium azide (NaN3) serves as a safe source of azide species owing to its solid
nature and easy handling. After aqueous workup and purification steps,
product 9a was obtained in a satisfactory yield (50%).
A reaction between 3-acetyl benzonitrile and sodium azide in the presence
of only DABCO-IL 3 up to 8 h to form corresponding 1H-tetrazole gave low yield (10%), whereas the click reaction
in the only solvent (EtOH) gave no corresponding product (9g) because of the solubility issue of sodium azide in ethanol. The
results signify the importance of our DABCO-based DES melt as a solvent
to perform the click reactions. The scope of DABCO-IL 3-based DES (Table 2, entry 21) was expanded by the reaction of different substituted
benzonitriles with NaN3 to get corresponding 1H-tetrazoles 9a–9h in variable yields (Figure 2). The yields of
4′-fluoro 9d (52%) and 4′-methoxy 9a (50%) phenyl-substituted tetrazoles were found to be the
highest among the series. 4′-Chloro 9b and 4′-bromo 9f phenyl-substituted tetrazoles were produced in modest yields,
45 and 43%, respectively, whereas the synthesis of 4′-methyl-substituted
tetrazole 9e has unexpectedly low yield (39%) among the
series. The yield of 2′-methyl-substituted tetrazole 9c was also low (40%), which may be due to the steric hindrance
of the ortho methyl group at the phenyl ring. Furthermore, the tetrazoles
having 3′-acetyl 9g (44%) and 3′-methyl 9i (43%) substituents on the phenyl ring were also obtained
in modest yields. Moreover, the unsubstituted phenyl 1H-tetrazole 9h was formed in 44% yield. Overall, the
yields of substituted phenyl 1H-tetrazoles were found
to be between 52 and 39% (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Synthesis of substituted 1H-tetrazoles 9a–9h in DABCO–PEG-based DESs.

The successful synthesis of indoles and 1H-tetrazoles
in DABCO–PEG-based DESs showed the application of PEGs as HBD
in DES in combination with ILs. The use of PEG in DES has an additional
benefit of avoiding volatile solvent to develop green and eco-friendly
reaction media. Moreover, the thermal stability of DABCO-based ILs 2–4 was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). Figure 3a shows
the overlap of TGA graph and its first derivative (DTG) for DABCO-IL 3, and Figure 3b shows the overlap of its TGA and DSC graphs. In the first step,
there is a weight loss of about 37% in the temperature range from
ambient to 110 °C, and the corresponding DSC data in this range
suggest that an endothermic process is associated with this change.
This weight loss is most likely due to the loss of water molecules.
After initial loss of water, the weight remains stable until being
heated up to 215 °C, after which a sharp decrease in weight (28%)
is observed; this is the first decomposition temperature, 230 °C,
as indicated by the DTG. According to DSC, this weight loss is also
an endothermic process and is probably due to the loss of alkyl chains.
Immediately after this step, a gradual weight loss of about 32% is
observed, which corresponds to the second decomposition temperature
of 290 °C as indicated by the DTG. Similar to the previous step,
this was also an endothermic process as can be seen from the DSC graph.
The thermal data of DABCO-ILs (2, 4) have
been included in Figure S1. The DABCO-based
ILs (2–4) were found to have sufficiently high
decomposition temperatures (235 °C 2, 230 °C 3, and 255 °C 4, respectively) (Figures 3 and S1).

DABCO-IL 3.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, DABCO-based ILs 2–4 were synthesized
and mixed with different alcohols and PEGs of varying molar masses
as HBD to prepare DESs for organic reactions including indole and
1H-tetrazole synthesis. The optimized DES, made up
of IL 3 and PEG400, was explored further for
the synthesis of different indoles (7a–7h) to
validate the scope of IL–PEG-based DES. The DES melt was also
used to perform the click reaction for the synthesis of 1H-tetrazoles (9a–9i). The use of PEGs of varying
molar masses as HBD in DES proved to be a safer and environmentally
friendly reaction medium and opens new avenue for further research
in this area.

4 Experimental Section
1DABCO (≥99.0%), ethyl iodide, pentyl bromide, heptyl bromide,
and toluene (≥99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used without any purification unless otherwise stated. Thin layer
chromatography (TLC) was carried out using silica gel 60 aluminum-backed
plates 0.063–0.200 mm. Analytical grade solvents such as dichloromethane,
ethyl acetate (EtOAc), diethyl ether, hexane, methanol, and so forth
were used. Short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) radiation at 254 nm was
used for the visualization of TLC plates. Staining mixtures such as
basic potassium permanganate or vanillin were also used for spot visualization
on TLC plates. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector-22 spectrometer.
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers
at 300, 400, and 500 MHz, whereas the carbon magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded at 75, 100, and 125 MHz in deuterated
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. The chemical
shifts were recorded on the δ-scale (ppm) using residual solvents
as an internal standard (DMSO; 1H 2.50, 13C
39.43).19 Coupling constants were calculated
in hertz; the multiplicities were labeled as s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), and quint (quintet); and the prefixes br
(broad) or app (apparent) were used. Mass spectra (EI+ and
ESI+) were recorded on Finnigan MAT-321A, Germany. Preparative
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (JAI model number LC-908)
having a UV–vis detector was used for the purification of the
compounds (7g and 7h). A normal-phase silica-D-60
column (20 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size) with a flow
rate of 3 mL/min was used.

4.1 General Synthetic Procedure
for DABCO-Based
Ionic Fluoride Salts
In a typical reaction, DABCO (500 mg,
4.46 mmol, and 1 equiv) was added to the oven-dried round-bottom flask
along with the solvents toluene/dichloromethane (3:5). To the resulting
solution, the corresponding ethyl iodide (1.50 g, 9.68 mmol, and 2.2
equiv) was added at room temperature and heated at reflux (118–120
°C) until no starting material was observed on the TLC analysis.
On cooling, the resulting ionic salt was separated and washed further
with cold toluene and dried in vacuo. The obtained material was further
washed with cold toluene (10 mL × 3) to get the final desired
products DABCO-ILs (2–4). All ionic salts were
characterized using 1H, 13C NMR, IR, UV spectroscopy,
and mass spectrometry.

4.3 Procedure for the Synthesis of Substituted

with DABCO-IL 5 and HBD (alcohol or PEG polymer) in a
ratio of 1:2, respectively. The mixture was heated at 80 °C to
homogenize it, and then to this mixture corresponding phenyl hydrazine
hydrochloride (1 mmol and 1 equiv) and cyclohexanone (1 mmol and 1
equiv) were added. The resulting reaction mixture was heated at reflux
(78–80 °C) until the complete consumption of phenyl hydrazine
(the starting material), as monitored by TLC by using the eluant mixture
of EtOAc and hexane. Upon the complete consumption of the starting
material, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and
then crashed ice was added to the reaction flask. The resulting mixture
was stirred to get precipitates that were filtered and washed with
cold distilled water to get the desired product (7a–7h). For some samples, silica gel column chromatography with the gradient
eluant mixture of EtOAc and hexane (1:9 to 9:1) was used to purify
the product.

4.4 General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Phenyl
1H-Tetrazoles 9a–9i
In a typical procedure, an oven-dried round-bottom flask was charged
with DABCO-IL 3 and HBD (PEG400 polymer) in
a ratio of 1:2, respectively. The mixture was homogenized by heating
at 80 °C and then corresponding benzonitrile (1 mmol and 1 equiv)
and sodium azide (3.5 mmol and 3.5 equiv) were added. The resulting
reaction mixture was heated at 115–120 °C until the complete
consumption of starting materials as monitored by the TLC analysis.
Furthermore, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
diluted with EtOAc (2–3 mL), and then 5% HCl (5–8 mL)
was added and stirred for a while to get the precipitates of the desired
tetrazole. Some reaction mixtures were extracted with EtOAc (25 mL
× 2). The organic layers were combined, dried with MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated in vacuo to get the 1H-tetrazole (9a–9i).
