Ordered self-assembly
of small organic molecules may induce novel
properties in a supramolecular arrangement and can act as advance
functional materials. This paper discusses the development of a new
stimuli-responsive dipeptide hydrogelator containing l-phenylalanine
and α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). The dipeptide Boc-Phe-Aib-OH,
on addition with three equivalent of sodium hydroxide and water, transformed
into a robust hydrogel. The transparent hydrogel is self-healing in
nature. The instant gelation is highly selective toward sodium hydroxide
and does not need any sonication or heating–cooling cycle.
The thixotropic nature of the gel has been confirmed by rheological
step-strain experiments at room temperature. Moreover, in the oil–water
mixture, the compound exhibits phase-selective gelation. When the
gel cylinder is cut into pieces, it does not conduct electricity,
but once self-healing occurs, it conducts electricity. The diffusion
of rhodamine 6G through the hydrogel indicates the dynamic nature.
The hydrogel is highly sensitive toward HCl, that is, in the presence
of HCl vapor, the gel becomes deformed.

Introduction
Precise organization,
selective interaction, and molecular recognition
are keys for the fabrication of multicomponent advance materials like
supramolecular gels.1−9 The supramolecular gels contain mostly the liquid, immobilized by
a cross-linked network of fibers made of self-organized building blocks.10−12 Because of the formation through noncovalent interactions such as
the hydrogen bonding interaction, π–π stacking
interaction, and ion pairing interactions between the building blocks,
the supramolecular gels are reversible. The supramolecular gels can
be stimuli responsive by introducing receptor unit in the gelator
molecule. Many reported that supramolecular gels have excellent sensitivity
to the different stimuli including ions, pH, enzyme, heat, light,
ultrasound, and mechanical steering.13 Moreover,
the supramolecular gels have high homogeneity, tunability, biocompatibility,
and degradability.14 The supramolecular
gels are used in many areas, from foods to electronics. These soft
materials have wide applications as sensors for biologically important
molecules and ions, as light-harvesting materials,15−19 as an efficient catalyst20 for optoelectronic systems,21 and as
an external support for tissue repairing and tissue engineering as
well as selective drug delivery.22−29 Different low molecular weight organic compounds including steroids,30 short peptides and peptide mimetics,31−34 urea derivatives,35−40 carbohydrates,41 dendrimers,42,43 and π-gelators44,45 have been used to form a stable
supramolecular gel. However, most of these compounds may be obtained
by a complex multistep synthesis. Also, most of these compounds are
insoluble in water. Therefore, the exploration of simple stimuli-responsive
low molecular weight hydrogelators with diverse applications is highly
important.46−48

Herein, we have synthesized a dipeptide (Figure 1) that can form stimuli-responsive,
robust
transparent hydrogel with significant self-healing propensity. The
hydrogelation is extremely selective with sodium hydroxide. The gel
exhibits high stability and thixotropic behavior. The supramolecular
hydrogel can be used as soft conducting materials. The hydrogel can
be colored with dyes and can be crafted in any shape. The hydrogel
is highly sensitive toward HCl vapor (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Chemical structure of dipeptide 1.

Results and Discussion
The dipeptide
was synthesized by traditional solution phase methods,
purified, and well characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(both 1H NMR and 13C NMR), FT-IR spectroscopy,
and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. A detailed description of the
synthesis and characterization of dipeptide 1 is given
in the Supporting Information. Briefly, tBoc-protected phenylalanine was coupled with Aib-OMe using
a standard coupling reagent N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) followed by hydrolysis to
obtain 1 in good yield. The signals at δ 7.26 to
7.17 in its 1H NMR spectrum are assigned to the aromatic
protons of phenylalanine. The signals at δ 8.05 have been assigned
to the NH of Aib. The signal at m/z 373.41 in the ESI-mass spectrum further confirmed the formation
of the dipeptide.

The dipeptide, Boc-Phe-Aib-OH, when mixed
with 3 equiv of sodium
hydroxide in water and shaken for 30 s, due to the effect of mixing
transformed to a stable transparent hydrogel (Figure 2). The instant hydrogel formation is extremely
sensitive to sodium hydroxide only. Other bases such as KOH, LiOH,
K2CO3, Na2CO3, and NH4OH fail to form hydrogels under same conditions (Figure 2). The dipeptide,
Boc-Phe-Aib-OH, forms gel in the mixture of NH4OH and NaCl;
Na2CO3 and LiOH; and NaCl and LiOH (Figure 2). This indicates
that not only sodium but also hydroxide ions have a significant role
in the supramolecular hydrogel formation. The minimum gelation concentration
for peptide 1 is 4 mg/mL. The supramolecular hydrogel
formation has been confirmed by an inverted vial test.49,50

and (I) K2CO3. Hydrogel forms only in the presence
of sodium and hydroxide ion. Peptide (10 mg/mL, 1.0 w/v %) was used.

More excitingly, the hydrogel
formation does not require additional
stimuli like sonication and heating–cooling cycles. We have
also tested the gelation under the same condition with analogues of
dipeptide 1 such as Boc-Tyr-Aib-OH, Boc-Trp-Aib-OH, Boc-Phe-Ala-OH,29 Boc-Phe-Gly-OH,24 and Boc-Aib-Phe-OH. However, they have failed to form such a kind
of hydrogel (Figure 3). The transparent hydrogels can be kept at room temperature for
3 months. The hydrogel has shown an endotherm on heating at 67.8 °C
(Supporting Information, Figure S1).

and (F) Boc-Aib-Phe-OH. Hydrogel forms only in Boc-Phe-Aib-OH.

Different rheological studies
have been performed to know the visco-elastic
properties of the NaOH-responsive hydrogel.51 Rheology provides insights about the tertiary structure (type of
network) presence in the gel.33 The rheological
data were obtained using a freshly prepared NaOH-sensitive hydrogel.
The elastic response of the hydrogel (G′,
storage modulus) and the viscous response (G″,
loss modulus) were examined as a function of shear strain at 20 °C,
and 10 rad s–1 frequency. For NaOH-responsive supramolecular
hydrogel, the G′ (storage modulus) was approximately
an order of magnitude larger than the G″ (loss
modulus). This indicates the elastic nature of the hydrogel which
is common for physical cross-link (Figure 4). The G′ and G″ have not crossed each other, which indicates that
the hydrogel is stable and rigid.

Figure 4 Dynamic rheology of hydrogel contained
1.0% (w/v) gelator; frequency
sweep experiment at 20 °C at a constant strain (0.1%).

The thixotropic behavior of the
hydrogel was confirmed by rheological
measurement. Under external stimuli, a thixotropic gel can disintegrate
to solution or a quasiliquid state and can regain its original shape
after the removal of the applied force. To figure out the thixotropic
property of the NaOH-responsive hydrogel, rheological step-strain
experiments52,53 have been done at 20 °C
under varying strain. At first, gels were placed at a constant strain
of 0.1%, which shows that G′ is higher than G″ (step 1, Figure 5). Finally, the strain increased from 0.1 to 50% and
was continued for few minutes. This shows the complete inversion of G′ and G″, indicating the
complete break of the hydrogel (step 2, Figure 5). Again the strain was decreased from 50
to 0.1% and continued for few minutes and gel restoration kinetics
were observed (step 3, Figure 5). This was continued for several cycles and confirmed the
self-healing behavior of the NaOH-responsive hydrogel.

Figure 5 Thixotropic data of the
NaOH responsive hydrogel contained 1.0%
(w/v) gelator, obtained by step-strain measurements at 20 °C
at a constant frequency (0.1 rad s–1).

The morphology of the NaOH-responsive hydrogel
was investigated
by the field emission scanning electron microscopic studies (FE-SEM).54 The FE-SEM images of xerogel exhibit rod-like
fibrillar network structures. The polydisperse fibrils are highly
entangled to form the network structure (Figure 6a). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) studies have been done to know the alkali metal content in the
xerogel matrix. The EDS confirms the sodium content (Figure 6b). To determine the topology
of fibrillar aggregates, atomic force microscopic (AFM) experiments
of the hydrogel were done. The NaOH-responsive peptide 1 hydrogel was sliced and cast on a microscopic glass coverslip and
dried by slow evaporation. The microscopic glass slide was then allowed
to dry under vacuum at room temperature for 3 days and studied by
AFM. Interestingly, the AFM shows the presence of twisted helical
fibers (Figure 6c).
The dipeptide contains a l-Phe residue. Helical twisted gel
fibers are common for chiral gelators, as the molecular chirality
is generally translated to the supramolecular level. The height profile
diagram (Figure 6c
inset) of hydrogel fibers (line 1 marked in Figure 6c) suggests that the distinct fibers are
closely packed. The 3D image (Figure 6d) exhibits that the twisted fiber surface is very
rough.

Figure 6 (a) FE-SEM image of the xerogel exhibiting a fibrillar structure
of NaOH-responsive peptide 1 hydrogel. (b) EDS exhibits
the presence of sodium in gel fibers. (c) AFM image of the xerogel
showing that the hydrogel fibers are twisted in nature (inset: height
profile plot). (d) 3D image of a twisted fibrillar network.

The peptide 1 in
methanol–water (1:1) solution
exhibits an absorption band at 290 nm responsible for π–π*
transition. The intensity of the band gradually increases with the
increasing NaOH concentration (Figure 7a). The emission spectrum of peptide 1 in methanol–water (1:1) solution also shows that with the
increasing NaOH concentration both bands at 365 nm for the aromatic
ring and 422 nm responsible for molecular stacking are increasing
(Figure 7b). The NaOH-responsive
peptide 1 hydrogel exhibits blue emission upon excitation
at 366 nm (Figure 7c).

Figure 7 (a) Absorption spectra of peptide 1 with gradual addition
of NaOH show increasing intensity of the band at 290 nm. (b) Emission
spectra of peptide 1 with gradual addition of NaOH. (c)
Hydrogel exhibits blue emission upon excitation at 366 nm.

Furthermore, the NaOH-responsive aggregation of
peptide 1 was investigated by circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy with a
JASCO J-815-150S instrument at 25 °C. For this experiment, a
1 cm path length quartz cell cuvette was used. The CD spectra of peptide 1 (1 × 10–5 M, in methanol–water
(1:1) solution) show negative Cotton effect at 214 and 230 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S2). This indicates
an antiparallel sheet-like structure for peptide 1. With
the addition of NaOH, the intensity of the band decreases and a new
band appeared at 208 nm. Titration of peptide 1 in CD3OD (90%, 10% D2O) with increasing NaOH amount was
recorded by 1H NMR spectroscopy. This provides clear evidence
of the NaOH peptide 1 interaction. The Aib NH proton
disappeared, and Phe α proton signal of peptide 1 shifted gradually toward downfield with the addition of NaOH, which
suggests the interaction between NaOH and peptide 1 (Supporting Information, Figure S3).

Xerogel
was grinded with the help of a mortar and pastel for 1
min to obtain a fine powder. Then, the powder sample was placed in
a glass sample holder, and then, the holder was placed into the Rigaku
X-ray diffractometer (C 3000) with a parallel beam optics attachment
horizontally to measure the data. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
of peptide 1 xerogel indicates a crystalline structure
and shows multiple diffractions at 2θ = 9.04 (9.772 Å),
18.12 (4.891 Å), 22.28 (3.986 Å), 27.90 (3.194 Å),
29.05 (3.071 Å), 32.37 (2.763 Å), 33.90 (2.642 Å),
34.80 (2.575 Å), 35.69 (2.513 Å), 36.83 (2.438 Å),
and 39.90° (2.257 Å) (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The strongest scattering peak at 9.04° (2θ)
corresponds to a second-order diffraction and antiparallel structure.25 Finally, the dipeptide has also been characterized
by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. From X-ray crystallography,
the asymmetric unit contains one molecule of dipeptide 1. The ORTEP diagram (Figure 8a) of dipeptide 1 exhibits that the backbone
of peptide have a kink-like conformation (ϕ1 = −82.90°
and ψ1 = 128.00°). The individual subunits are
themselves regularly interlinked through multiple O–H···O
and N–H···O intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interaction and hence form a supramolecular sheet along the crystallographic b direction (Figure 8b). The hydrogen bonding parameters of peptide 1 are also listed in the Supporting Information Table S1. The supramolecular sheet-like structures are also stabilized
by π–π stacking interactions (shortest C–C
distance is 4.03 Å) between Phe aromatic rings. A β-sheet-like
arrangement of the gelator molecule both in the gel state as well
as solid state was confirmed from the crystal structure matching with
the PXRD data (Figure S4).

peptide 1. (b) Intermolecular
hydrogen bond-mediated supramolecular sheet-like structure of peptide 1 along the crystallographic b direction.

The NaOH-responsive hydrogel formed
by peptide 1 at
low concentration (4 wt %) is very stable. Different self-supporting
geometrical shape can be crafted from the gel.55 By holding, one side a gel bar can be suspended in air
(Figure 9a). The NaOH-responsive
hydrogels formed by peptide 1 low concentration (4 wt
%) are strong enough to tolerate several grams of weight (Figure 9b,c). Even, one can
slice a big gel block into several small pieces (Figure 9d).56 The hydrogel is very dynamic in nature. The dye rhodamine 6G can
disperse through the gel block. Moreover, the hydrogels have significant
self-healing properties. When a block of gel was cut into two pieces
and then placed together, the pieces merged.56 Also, several small pieces of hydrogels could be merged into a continuous
stable self-supporting bar. These fused bars could be suspended in
air by holding one side. Inside the hydrogel, there exists a dynamic
equilibrium showing the formation of new self-assembled fibers as
well as dissociation of mature fibers. This dynamic equilibrium allows
the regeneration of new fibers at the fusion interface, which is important
for the self-healing and repairing process. The fusion of a rhodamine
6G-doped hydrogel bar with an undoped hydrogel bar shows the diffusion
of rhodamine 6G through an undoped hydrogel bar. This exhibits the
dynamic exchange of dissolved molecules at the interface (Figure 9d–f). This
is further established by electric conductivity experiments.57 The conductivity of a hydrogel was measured
by an ONKTON PC-2700 conductivity meter. The cylindrical electrodes
which are separated by 1 cm were used. The NaOH-responsive hydrogel
block formed by peptide 1 is highly conducting (Supporting Information, Figure S5). Conductance
of NaOH added water = 253.60 μS/cm. Conductance of the gel =
194.20 μS/cm. Therefore, the conductivity decreased from Figure S5c to S5d,
but the decrease is quite small. As the gels were formed, the mobility
of the ions decreased and as a result of that conductivity decreased.
Connection of the battery, LED, and gel block complete the circuit
and shows the flow of electricity. However, chopping the gel block
into two pieces disrupts the electric circuit and exhibits no flow
of electricity. However, when joining the pieces together, because
of self-healing, the gel pieces merged into a continuous gel block
and conductivity of the circuit is regained (Figure 9g).

in hand. (b) 100 mL

The selectivity of peptide 1 to form NaOH-responsive
hydrogels without any heating, stirring, or sonication makes it an
interesting candidate in the separation of trace amounts of water
from the organic solvent.58 The worm-like
micelles of peptide 1 have been formed, which convert
to invertable materials in multiple equivalents of NaOH, as one would
need to screen the charge effectively to form a “gel”.
Hence, the need for Na as the packing will depend on the packing which
will be affected by the counterion as a normal surfactant. If there
is diesel–water mixture, one can separate the water from diesel
by the addition of peptide 1 and NaOH and forming hydrogel
(Supporting Information, Figure S6). The
diesel can be separated by decantation or filtration.

Moreover,
the hydrogel can be used as an online HCl gas sensor.
This is highly important for environmental pollution analysis, automotive
industry, and chemical industry. To demonstrate the HCl sensing application,
a block of hydrogel was charged with HCl gas. HCl gas was generated
in situ by the reaction between NaCl and H2SO4 (2NaCl + H2SO4 = Na2SO4 + 2HCl). A hydrogel cylinder was made by the dipeptide 1 (1.0% (w/v)) at room temperature. All electrical circuits were prepared
by the inclusion of a gel cylinder. Then, the HCl gas was passed over
the gel cylinder using a glass tube. On contact with HCl gas, the
gel block deformed (Figure 10, Supporting InformationVideo S1). However, the gel is not responding
to others like H2S, SOCl2, and CO2. The process of HCl gas detection can be upgraded to an on-line
process for safety-related applications in industries which use or
produce large amounts of HCl.

cylinders in contact with
HCl gas. (c,d) Gel cylinders are deformed by sensing HCl gas.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
discussed stimuli-sensitive dipeptide-based
hydrogel at room temperature. The peptide Boc-Phe-Aib-OH 1 forms a parallel sheet-like structure. The gelation is extremely
selective for sodium hydroxide only. The dipeptide hydrogel has high
stability and load bearing capacity. The hydrogel shows self-healing
properties and thixotropic nature. The dipeptide exhibits phase-selective
gelation in oil–water mixtures. The diffusion of rhodamine
6G through the hydrogel shows the dynamic nature of the hydrogel.
The self-healing gel is conductive. When the gel matrix is broken,
it does not conduct electricity, but once self-healing occurs, it
conducts electricity. The hydrogel is highly sensitive toward HCl
vapor. These findings show that the self-healing hydrogel with its
novel properties is promising for soft conducting materials and HCl
sensors.

were in the range 1–10 mm in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6. For NMR titration, peptide 1 was dissolved in CD3OD (90%, 10% D2O), and
NaOH solution in D2O was gradually added and was recorded
by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

with a PerkinElmer spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer by the KBr disk
technique.

spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer UV/Vis spectrometer (LAMBDA 35) using 1

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectra were recorded on a Waters
Corporation Q-Tof Micro YA263 high-resolution mass spectrometer using
positive-mode electrospray ionization.

Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy
FE-SEM
has been used to know the morphologies of the reported compounds.
A drop of sample solution was placed on a clean microscopic glass
slide and dried by slow evaporation. The materials were gold-coated,
and the micrographs were taken in an FE-SEM apparatus (JEOL scanning
microscope-JSM-6700F).

Atomic Force Microscopy
The topology
of the hydrogel
was investigated by AFM. A slice of gel was placed on a clean microscopic
glass coverslip and dried by slow evaporation. The sample was then
allowed to dry under vacuum at room temperature for 3 days. Images
of the xerogel were taken by semicontact-mode using an NTMDT instrument,
model no. AP-0100.

Powder X-ray Diffraction Study
The
PXRD pattern was
carried out in a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (C 3000) with a parallel
beam optics attachment. The instrument was operated at a 45 kV voltage
and 200 mA current and was calibrated with a standard silicon sample.
The wavelength of the X-ray source is 1.5418 Å (Kα value
of Cu). Xerogel was grinded for 1 min to obtain a fine powder sample
with the help of a mortar and pastel. Then, the powder sample was
subjected to place in a glass sample holder, and then the holder was
placed into the instrument horizontally to measure the PXRD data.

CD Spectroscopy
CD experiments of the reported peptides
in 1:1 methanol to water mixture have been done with a JASCO J-815-150S
instrument at 25 °C. For this experiment, a 1 cm path length
quartz cell cuvette was used.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed by a METTLER DSC instrument
under N2 gas. The sample (30 mg) was placed in the sample
holder for the DSC experiment.

Gelation
The peptide 1 (BOC-Phe-Aib-OH)
(4 mg, 1 equiv) and an excess of NaOH (3 equiv) were mixed in 1 mL
of water at room temperature and shaken for 30 s, the mixing has an
effect and instant hydrogel formed.

Rheological Experiments
To understand the mechanical
strengths and thixotropic behavior of the hydrogel, we performed rheological
measurements on an MCR 102 rheometer (Anton Paar, modular compact
rheometer) using a steel parallel plate geometry with a 40 mm diameter
at 20 °C. To control the temperature accurately during the experiment,
the rheometer is attached to a Peltier circulator thermo cube. The
storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of the hydrogels have been recorded using that
experimental setup. From the dynamic strain sweep experiment, this
hydrogel is stable up to 6.6% strain. This type of low strain tolerance
is quite common for peptide-based hydrogel. In step-strain experiment,
generally higher strain than the ruptured strain value has been used.
Because the gel is stable up to 6.6% strain value, 50% strain (around
8 times higher) was used for the step-strain measurement.

Conductivity
Experiments
The electrical conductivity
of a hydrogel was measured by an ONKTON PC-2700 conductivity meter.
The electrical conductivity of a solution or a gel is measured by
determining the resistance of the solution or gel between two flat
or cylindrical electrodes separated by a fixed distance. Here, we
have used cylindrical electrodes which are separated by 1 cm. A mixture
of dipeptide 1 [1.0% (w/v)] and NaOH (3 equiv) in water
was dipped into the electrodes, and the data were recorded.

HCl Sensing
Experiments
For the HCl-triggered experiment,
HCl gas was generated with the reaction between NaCl and H2SO4. A hydrogel cylinder was made by the dipeptide 1 [1.0% (w/v)] at room temperature. All electrical circuits
were prepared by the inclusion of a gel cylinder. Then, the HCl gas
was passed over the gel cylinder using a glass tube.

X-ray Crystallography
X-ray diffraction quality the
white colored crystal of the dipeptide 1 was obtained
by slow evaporation of methanol–water solution. Intensity data
have been collected with Mo Kα radiation using a Bruker APEX-2
CCD diffractometer. Data were processed by Bruker SAINT package, and
the structure solution and refinement were done using SHELX97. The
nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters.
The data have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre with reference CCDC 1583322.
