According to the activity–structure
relationship of the
C-13 side chain in paclitaxel or docetaxel, eighteen novel paclitaxel–dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA) hybrids were designed and synthesized by Pd(II)-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling of 17-trifluoromethanesulfonic enolate-DHEA with different
aryl boronic acids. The in vitro anticancer activity of the hybrids
against a human liver cancer cell line (HepG-2) was evaluated by MTT
assay, showing that most of these hybrids possessed moderate antiproliferative
activity against the HepG-2 cancer cell line. Among these hybrids,
three ones (7b, 7g, and 7i)
with ortho-substituents in the phenyl group of the D-ring of DHEA
analogues exhibited moderate anticancer activity. The optimal compound 7i showed superior anticancer activity against the HepG-2
cell line with an IC50 value of 26.39 μM.

Introduction
Paclitaxel (Taxol),
isolated from the bark of Taxus
brevifolia Nutt in the late 1960s,1 and its semisynthetic derivatives docetaxel (Taxotere)
and cabazitaxel (Jevana) (Figure 1) currently serve as the most widely used clinical
antitumor drugs against breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell
lung cancer, and prostate cancer, among various chemotherapeutic agents.2 They are known to exert their therapeutic effect
by their ability to accelerate the polymerization of tubulin and stabilize
the resultant microtubules, which leads to apoptosis through a cell-signaling
cascade.3−5 Because the significant role of taxoids in the field
of anticancer and their undesirable side effects as well as drug resistance,
numerous endeavors has been devoted to in-depth research on the structure–activity
relationships (SARs) of paclitaxel to reveal the minimal structural
requirements essential for biological activity and develop next-generation
taxoid anticancer agents with better pharmacological properties and
improved activity.2,6,7 As
a result of the SAR studies, the oxetane D-ring and unique C-13 side
chains of paclitaxel were indispensable active groups,8−12 and it has been justified by a range of successful studies of paclitaxel
mimics that the complex taxane skeleton was replaced by a structurally
simplified core but retained part of the three-dimensional configuration
and phenylisoserine side chain of paclitaxel.13−17

Figure 1 Structures of paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and
abiraterone.

Currently, a good deal of bioactive
taxoid mimics have resulted
from modifications of the functional groups on the taxane baccatin
core or modification of the size of the carbon rings contained within
the molecule.2 By contrast, less attention
has been paid to the hybridization of paclitaxel with other biologically
active natural products. In 2000, Wandless et al.18 reported six paclitaxel–daunorubicin hybrids, and
all of them displayed cytotoxic activity, although less than the parent
monomers. In 2005, Guénard et al.16 reported eight paclitaxel-steroidal hybrids bearing the phenylisoserine
side chain to mimic “T-form” docetaxel. Their cytotoxicity
against the KB cell line and MCF-7 cell line was not as excellent
as that of docetaxel and did not show any inhibitory activity for
microtubule disassembly. Although the above studies did not render
any taxoid mimic with improved anticancer activity, they revealed
that paclitaxel–natural product-based hybrids were potential
agents which could be possibly extended and strengthen the medical
utility of Taxol. Furthermore, the highly complex structure of paclitaxel,
especially its baccatin component, prevents the large-scale production
of synthetic paclitaxel, which makes paclitaxel prohibitively expensive.
Therefore, the combination of the minimal pharmacophore of the taxoid
(the C-13 phenylisoserine side chain) with other accessible taxane
skeleton-like natural compounds to generate a baccatin-free compound
with a taxane-like conformation which retains appreciable antitumor
activity is necessary and exciting.

In our previous studies,8 assays for
antiproliferative activity indicated that paclitaxel mimics possessing
only C-13 side chains and oxetane D-ring structures showed moderate
antitumor activities. This result encouraged us to explore other paclitaxel
mimics with both C-13 side chains and widely distributed paclitaxel-like
natural skeletons. Kingston et al.19 synthesized
twelve steroid-linked Taxol analogues as potential anticancer drugs.
They revealed that all conjugates were cytotoxic to the A2870 ovarian
cancer cell line, although less so than Taxol. Inspired by this, we
envisioned searching for more steroid analogues as the substituents
of the baccatin core of Taxol. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a
steroidal hormone which aids in the prevention of cancer in rodents.
Studies show that low circulating levels of DHEA have been associated
with a higher incidence of breast cancer in women.20 In addition to its economical and accessible properties,
the conformation and structure of DHEA are similar to those of taxane.
Most important of all, abiraterone (Figure 1), formed by introducing a nitrogen heterocyclic
ring into the D-ring of DHEA, has been used to treat cancer in clinic.21 There may be potential advantages for hybrid
molecules if both drugs can be deactivated as the result of linking
function and then released together.18 Accordingly,
all the abovementioned benefits encourage us to synthesize paclitaxel–DHEA
mimic hybrids to extend and strengthen the therapeutic use of paclitaxel
for paclitaxel-resistant or paclitaxel-insensitive tumors. Herein,
we reported the synthesis and in vitro anticancer activity of eighteen
paclitaxel–DHEA hybrids, in which the intricate baccatin core
is structurally replaced by DHEA analogues. In the synthesis strategy,
the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction which is known for the formation
of Csp2–Csp2 bonds was used as a key
step to introduce different aromatic chains in the D-ring of DHEA
to increase the diversity of this natural product. It is worth mentioning
that this reaction is mainly used in the total synthesis of natural
products;22−26 rare examples of direct modification of natural compounds with this
reaction have been reported.27,28

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
A series of novel hybrids consisting of DHEA
mimic subunits have been designed and synthesized to replace the paclitaxel
baccatin scaffold. The preparation of the hybrids is outlined in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
Designed Paclitaxel Hybrids 7a–7r
Starting from DHEA, masking of the free hydroxy group
as a silyl
ether, followed by treatment with PhN(Tf)2 and potassium
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS) at −78 °C, provided triflate 2. Next, the famous Suzuki–Miyaura reaction which is
widely used for the formation of Csp2–Csp2 bonds was carried out on the triflate 2 as a key step
to cross-couple precursor 2 with boronic acid under the
catalysis of PdCl2(PPh3)2 to access
the targets 3a–3q. After deprotection of the 3-TBS
group, we focused on synthesizing the paclitaxel–DHEA hybrids.
The DHEA analogues 4a–4q were subjected to esterification
with the purchased oxazolidinecarboxylic acids 5a or 5b,29 which resulted in the formation
of oxazolidinecarboxylate 6a–6r (Scheme 1). Treatment of the intermediates 6a–6r with p-toluenesulfonic acid
yielded eighteen paclitaxel–DHEA hybrids 7a–7r in 60–85% yields.

Biological Activity Evaluation
The
eighteen newly synthesized
hybrids were evaluated in vitro for their anticancer activity against
a human tumor cell line (HepG-2) by MTT assay. The most interesting
results are presented in Table 1. All the hybrids showed less anticancer activity than the
positive control Taxol. Three ones (7b, 7g, and 7i) with ortho-substituents in the phenyl group
of the D-ring of DHEA analogues indicated moderate anticancer activity,
better than that of the others. Specifically, compound 7i exhibited the best anticancer activity against cell line HepG-2
with an IC50 value of 26.39 μM.

Conclusions
To
summarize, eighteen novel paclitaxel–DHEA hybrids were
designed and synthesized according to the SARs of Taxol and our previous
studies,8 using the Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction as a key step to directly introduce different aromatic chains
in the D-ring of DHEA. The MTT assay showed all the hybrids displayed
less anticancer activity than the positive control Taxol. Three ones
(7b, 7g, and 7i) with ortho-substituents
in the phenyl group of the D-ring of DHEA analogues indicated moderate
anticancer activity, better than that of the others. The results may
give inspiration and guide the following modification of paclitaxel-like
hybrids with improved anticancer activity. The use of a baccatin-free
hybrid component might be an effective strategy to establish a paclitaxel-based
hybrid library.

Chemistry
Materials
and General Method
Unless otherwise noted,
the reagents are commercially available and used without further purification.
Synthesized compounds were purified by chromatography on silica gel
(200–300 mesh) purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co.,
Ltd. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 600 or 400 NMR spectrometer
in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard;
chemical shifts (δ) were reported in ppm values and J in Hz. HR-ESI-MS data were measured using a Q-TOF micro
mass spectrometer (Waters).

Preparation of Compound 1
A solution of
DHEA (10.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv), imidazole (31.2 mmol, 3.0 equiv), and
4-N-dimethylaminopyridine (1.04 mmol, 0.1 equiv)
in dry dichloromethane (30 mL) was stirred at room temperature for
5 min. Then, tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (20.8
mmol, 2.0 equiv) was added to the mixed solution at 40 °C and
the resultant mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 h
until thin-layer chromatography showed complete consumption of the
starting compound. Then, the reaction mixture was extracted with water
and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) three times. The organic phase was washed
with brine water and dried over Na2SO4. After
removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column
chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum ether, 1:10) to afford compound 1 as a white solid in 90% yield. The 1H NMR data
are consistent with the reported literature.30

Preparation of Compound 2
KHMDS [0.5 M
in tetrahydrofuran (THF), 3 mL, 1.5 mmol, 3.0 equiv] was added to
the mixture of compound 1 (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and PhN(Tf)2 (0.75 mmol, 1.5 equiv) in dry THF at −78 °C and
the resultant mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 h
and then neutralized with saturated NH4Cl (aq.). The mixture
was extracted with EtOAc three times. The organic phase was washed
with water and brine and dried over Na2SO4.
After removal of the solvent, the crude mixture was purified by silica
gel column chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum ether, 1:50) to afford
the desired triflate 2 as a white solid, yield 65%. The 1H NMR data are consistent with the reported literature.31

General Procedure for the Compounds 3a–3q
A suspension of compound 2 (0.1 mmol, 1.0
equiv), boronic acid compound (0.1 mmol, 1 equiv), Na2CO3 (0.125 mmol, 1.25 equiv) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.003 mmol, 0.03 equiv) in toluene (2 mL), EtOH (0.4
mL), and water (1 mL) was stirred at 75 °C under argon for 0.5
h. Then, the mixture was added to saturated NaHCO3 aq.
(5.0 mL) and extracted with excess EtOAc three times. The organic
phase was washed with water and brine and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was removed and the crude mixture was
purified by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum ether,
1:20) to obtain the desired compounds 3a–3q as
a white solid, yield 60–90%.

General
Procedure for the Compounds 4a–4q
The
solution of compound 3 (0.05 mmol, 1.0
equiv) and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (0.06 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in THF
(10 mL) was stirred at 80 °C overnight. The mixture was neutralized
with saturated NH4Cl (aq.) and the resultant mixture was
extracted with EtOAc three times. The organic phase was washed with
water and brine and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent
was removed and the crude mixture was purified by silica gel column
chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum ether, 1:4) to afford the desired
compounds 4a–4q as a white solid, yield 86–95%.

General
Procedure for Compounds 6a–6r
A suspension
of compound 4 (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv),
oxazolidinecarboxylic acids 5a or 5b (0.12
mmol, 1.2 equiv), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (0.12
mmol, 1.2 equiv), and 4-(dimethylamino) pyridine (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
in toluene (5 mL) was stirred at 80 °C for 18 h and then quenched
with HCl (1 M). The mixture was added to a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (aq.) to adjust the mixture to pH 7 and then the mixture
was extracted with EtOAc three times. The organic layer was treated
with aqueous HCl (1 M), a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (aq.),
and then brine, and each washing was performed at least three times.
The organic layer was washed with 5% NaHCO3 liquid (3 ×
15 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. The residue was
purified by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum ether,
1:15) to afford the corresponding compounds 6a–6r as a white solid, yield 46–88%.

General Procedure for the
Compounds 7a–7r
The ester compound 6 (0.05 mmol 1.0 equiv)
was added to MeOH (2 mL) and treated with 4-toluene sulfonyl chloride
(0.3 mmol, 6.0 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 6 h and then diluted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed
with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (aq.) and brine, dried
with Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The
crude mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum
ether, 1:12) to afford the desired hybrids 7a–7r as a white solid, yield 60–85%.

Biology
Materials
MTT (M2128) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, Mo, USA). The HepG-2 cells were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal
bovine serum and incubated with 5% CO2.

MTT Assay
MTT assay was employed primarily for determination.
The in vitro inhibitory activities of eighteen hybrids on HepG-2 cells
were evaluated. HepG-2 cells were seeded at a density of 5 ×
103/well in a 96-well plate for 24 h and then treated with
different concentrations of compounds dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for 24 h, with the final DMSO concentrations lower than 0.1%.
Control cells were treated with Taxol containing 0.1% DMSO. DMSO served
as a negative control. Then, 10 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added
into each well and incubated for another 4 h. The purple formazan
crystals were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO and the absorbance
was detected at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo MK3, USA).
