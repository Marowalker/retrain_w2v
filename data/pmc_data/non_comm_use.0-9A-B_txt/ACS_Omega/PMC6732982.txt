The antipyretic potential
of viscosine, a natural product isolated from the medicinal plant Dodonaea viscosa, was investigated using yeast-induced
pyrexia rat model, and its structure–activity relationship
was investigated through molecular docking analyses with the target
enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and microsomal
prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). The in vivo antipyretic experiments
showed a progressive dose-dependent reduction in body temperatures
of the hyperthermic test animals when injected with viscosine. Comparison
of docking analyses with target enzymes showed strongest bonding interactions
(binding energy −17.34 kcal/mol) of viscosine with the active-site
pocket of mPGES-1. These findings suggest that viscosine shows antipyretic
properties by reducing the concentration of prostaglandin E2 in brain through its mPGES-1 inhibitory action and make it a potential
lead compound for developing effective and safer antipyretic drugs
for treating fever and related pathological conditions.

==== Body
Introduction
Pyrexia (fever) is associated with many diseases1 and is an expression of the body’s complex immunophysiologic
response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli that trigger a cascade
of biochemical reactions ultimately producing various endogenous pyrogens.2,3 Of these pyrogens, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
is the principal fever mediator in mammals.4,5 Although
it is body’s natural immune response and host-defense mechanism,
pyrexia results in general body discomfort and adversely affects the
normal functions of various body organs.6 Excessive rise of body temperature is controlled by endogenous antipyretics
liberated within the brain during fever.7 However, the use of antipyretic drugs is many times indispensable.

The commonly used antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents (i.e.,
salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) stop
or lower the formation of the principal fever mediator PEG2 by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selectively or nonselectively.8 However, COX inhibition can lead to various health
complications. Nonselective COX inhibitors are harmful to the gastrointestinal
tract causing gastric distress,9 ulceration,
and other bleeding disorders.10 Their prolonged
use in children and adolescents may lead to Reye’s syndrome
(liver damage).11 Prolonged use of selective
COX-2 inhibitors, particularly NSAIDs, is linked with higher risks
of cardiac attack12,13 and stroke, and patients with
kidney, heart, or liver conditions are at risk of developing kidney
damage.14 The long-term use of cyclooxygenase
inhibitors as antipyretic agents is associated with serious side effects.
An alternative antipyretic strategy is the inhibition of prostaglandin
E2 synthases (PGES),15,16 especially the microsomal prostaglandin
E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). The mPGES-1 catalyzes transformation of PGH2 to PGE2 in the last biosynthetic step and is a
promisingly safe target17,18 of antipyretic agents
because its inhibition is free of the side effects associated with
the COX inhibition.19,20 Numerous efforts are being made
for the development of next-generation anti-inflammatory and antipyretic
drugs based on mPGES-1 inhibitors.21−23 Usually for optimized search of lead compounds, structure-based
strategy employing ligand–receptor molecular docking24 is adopted for predicting interaction affinities
and binding modes of the drug molecules with a particular target receptor.25

We have previously isolated viscosine
(Figure 1) from the
medicinal plant Dodonaea viscosa, which
is reported to possess antinociceptive,26 neuropharmacological,27 lipoxygenase
inhibitory,28 hepatoprotective,29 anticholinesterase, and antioxidant properties.30 Since compounds with analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory
properties often possess antipyretic properties, we investigated the
in vivo antipyretic potential of viscosine and its possible mode of
action using an in silico approach. In this paper, we present the
antipyretic potential of viscosine against a yeast-induced pyrexia
model in rats. We also report the in silico findings showing viscosine
as an efficient mPGES-1 inhibitor, suggesting it as a lead compound
for developing effective and safe antipyretic drugs.

viscosine.

Results
Yeast induces a biochemical cascade
that ultimately leads to the release of biochemical mediators, especially
prostaglandin E2 and interleukins, which in turn upregulate
the thermoregulatory center, leading to hyperthermia and pyrexia.31 Any compound capable of inhibiting the cascade
of pyrexia-inducing mediators will manifest antipyretic activity32 such as paracetamol and other NSAIDs. The antipyretic
effects of viscosine on pyrexia are shown in Table 1. Yeast-induced pyrexia model was used to
investigate the therapeutic effect of viscosine in relieving fever,
which is often associated with inflammation.33 Upon treatment with viscosine, body temperatures of the test animals
were observed to decrease progressively in a dose-dependent manner.
Viscosine showed significant antipyretic potential (P < 0.01–0.001). In addition to the currently explored antipyretic
potential, our previous studies26 also
showed significant analgesic potential of viscosine compared to control,
as depicted in its analgesic profile (Figure 2). To investigate the possible mechanism
behind its antipyretic action, viscosine was docked with the possible
target enzymes COX-1, COX-2, and mPGES-1, and their structure–activity
relationships were investigated.
The docking results are presented in Figures 3–5.

Discussion
In antipyretic studies, both
viscosine (V60) and aspirin showed significant (P < 0.01) antipyretic activity after 2 h of their injection. The
antipyretic potential of viscosine increased with passage of time.
Both the low dosages of viscosine (V30 and V60) showed highly significant
antipyretic potential at the later stages comparable to the reference
drug, which showed significant effect at much higher dosage.

Results from the analgesic activities showed that viscosine as well
as aspirin significantly suppressed the writhing response in a dose-dependent
manner. It is apparent, however, that viscosine is significantly effective
at lower doses compared to aspirin. In conclusion, viscosine revealed
promising antipyretic potential during in vivo analyses and deserved
further exploration of the molecular mechanisms involved behind its
significant analgesic and antipyretic effects.

Docking analysis
with COX-1 showed (Figure 3) a total of four interactions: a single interaction between
hydroxyl group at position 5 of ring A with residue Gly45, two interactions
involving the carbonyl group at position 4 of the ring C with residues
Cys47 and Tyr130, and a single interaction between the hydroxyl group
at position 4′ of the ring B with residue Asn34 of the receptor.
Both the methoxy and aromatic rings showed no interactions with the
receptor. All of the interactions are through hydrogen bonding and,
thermodynamically, the inhibition is moderate with a binding energy
of −13.34 kcal/mol.

Docking studies of viscosine with
COX-2 also showed moderate ligand–receptor interactions (Figure 4). Overall, three
interactions with an overall binding energy of −10.46 kcal/mol
were observed, including an arene–cation interaction between
ring B and residue Lys68 and two hydrogen-bonding interactions between
hydroxyl moiety at position 5 with residue Asn28 and between 3-methoxy
group and residue Ser457.

Figure 4 Two-dimensional (a) and
three-dimensional (b) binding-site interaction models of COX-2 with
viscosine: The blue highlight represents ligand exposure; H-bond lengths,
2.77–3.0 Å.

Docking with mPGES-1 receptor also
showed four interactions (Figure 5). Of these, ring A showed
two arene–cation-type interactions with residues Lys41 and
Arg67, while the 4-carbonyl and 5-hydroxyl groups of the ligand showed
hydrogen-bonding interactions with Lys41 and Pro63, respectively.
Residue Lys41 of the receptor showed a hydrogen-bonding interaction
with carbonyl group of ring C and an arene–cation interaction
with ring A of the ligand. It is evident from the data that viscosine
interacts strongly with mPGES-1 with a predicted overall binding energy
of −17.34 kcal/mol.

Figure 5 Two-dimensional (a) and three-dimensional (b) binding-site
interaction models of mPGES-1 with viscosine: The blue highlight represents
ligand exposure; H-bond lengths, 2.77–3.0 Å.

Based on the strongly supportive
values of the binding energies obtained in our in silico investigations,
it can be safely deduced that viscosine possesses favorable structural
features to effectively interact and inhibit mPGES-1. This suggests
viscosine to be a safe antipyretic agent and should be considered
as a lead compound with promising potential for developing safe antipyretic
drugs.

Conclusions
The in vivo
studies performed on pyrexia-induced rats showed that viscosine possesses
strong antipyretic actions. Low dosages of viscosine showed high antipyretic
potential at later phases compared to aspirin. Viscosine also significantly
suppressed the writhing response in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular
docking studies suggest that viscosine showed stronger interactions
with microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 than the cyclooxygenases
and support the hypothesis that febrile response is reduced through
mPGES-1 inhibition. Comparison of the binding energies of viscosine
to that of other reported compounds32 suggests
the need for further studies to confirm that viscosine strongly inhibits
mPGES-1 prior to its consideration for developing safe antipyretic
drugs.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Experiments were
conducted with adult wistar rats (weighing 180–260 g) and Swiss
albino mice (weighing 18–25 g). All of the animals were housed
individually at 24 ± 1 °C with abundant access to water
and food until the experiment day, when only water was made available.
Animal experiments performed in the manuscript were conducted in compliance
with institutional guidelines,33 and permission
for the experiments was previously granted by the local ethics committee
for research on laboratory animals.

Yeast-Induced Pyrexia Model
The yeast-induced pyrexia model,
as reported by Al-Ghamdi,34 was selected
for evaluating the antipyretic properties of viscosine. Pyrexia was
induced into the test animals by subcutaneously injecting a 15% aqueous
yeast solution at a dosage of 10 mL/kg. Rectal temperatures of test
animals were recorded 24 h before and after injecting yeast through
a digital thermometer (Hartmann, Germany). The rats that did not show
a minimum elevation of 0.5 °C in rectal temperatures after the
yeast administration were excluded from experiment. The selected animals
were divided into five groups (each group comprising six animals)
and were separately treated with normal saline water, viscosine, and
the reference aspirin. Rectal temperature of each animal was subsequently
recorded for up to 5 h initially at 30 min and afterward at 1 h time
intervals.

Molecular Docking Analysis
Viscosine was taken as a ligand for molecular docking. The ligand
file was designed and optimized using the ChemBioDraw software (v.
14) and then converted to a 3D format through the “translate
molecular files” tools available in the SYBYL-X 2.0 platform.
Crystallographic structures of the targets COX-1 (PDB ID: 3KK6), COX-2 (PDB ID: 3LN1), and mPGES-1 (PDB
ID: 3DWW) were
taken from the archive of Protein Data Bank (RSCB PDB). The ligand
was docked with targets using the MOE software.

Accession Codes
