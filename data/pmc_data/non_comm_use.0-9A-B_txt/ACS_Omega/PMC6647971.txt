Geometry parameters, total energy
of the system in different spin
states, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and absorption spectra were
computed for a range of mononuclear quaterpyridine Ru(II), Fe(III/II),
and Co(III/II) complexes with two axial ambidentate CNS ligands by
using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations.
Both structural and electronic properties were found to be correlating
with the type of the binding atom in the CNS ligand (isomerization
differs by 4–13 kcal·mol–1). The N-bonding
of CNS ligands is energetically favored. It was also found that the
low spin (LS) state is the ground state for both Ru(II) and Co(III)
complexes regardless of the CNS arrangement. The other complexes are
the high-spin (HS) ground-state ones with the only exception of the
S-bonded CNS isomer of the Fe(III) complex. The dependencies of energy
differences between the HS and LS states versus C demonstrated stabilization
of the HS state with an increasing amount of the exact exchange admixture
(C) for iron and cobalt complexes. An opposite behavior was observed
for ruthenium complexes. The best match in harmonic vibrational frequencies
between the experimental and calculated values has been reached at
C = 0.15 for all the complexes. The absorption profile of the Fe(II)
complex with the alternatively bonded CNS ligands strongly depends
on the angle between them. The light-harvesting efficiency of the
Fe(II) complexes is very similar (∼0.4) and sufficiently close
to that of the Ru(II) complexes. The iron-based coordination compounds
are considered as a prospective dye for dye-sensitized solar cells.
The results of calculations were completed with experimental reference
data, thus providing a systematic compendium for practical use.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
the demand for technologies of clean and cheap energy
production is the conditional challenge for sustainable development.
The direct conversion of solar energy into electricity is one of the
promising ways to address the issue.1 Global
photovoltaics market is largely based on semiconductor solar cells.2 The manufacturing process is fairly expensive
because of large energy consumption. In comparison to conventional
high-quality silicon-based photoconverters, dye-sensitized solar cells
(DSSCs) are cost-effective photovoltaic devices because of inexpensive
materials involved and a rather simple fabrication process. After
the opening work on DSSCs by O’Regan and Grätzel3 published in 1991, a considerable amount of research
has been carried out to improve their efficiency from 7 to 14% (in
2015), the value deemed as sufficient for commercial use.4 A regular DSSC consists of a wide band gap semiconductor
(typically, TiO2) coated with a chromophore (a dye) layer
and immersed in a solution (an electrolyte) containing a redox mediator.
The light-harvesting centers (organic molecules, coordination compounds,
and inorganic nanoparticles) absorb quanta of light, converting into
an excited state. Then, the dye-to-semiconductor interfacial electron
transfer (IET) occurs generating a photoinduced current in the device.
Because a chromophore stays in the core of device design, its chemical
properties and absorption spectrum are among the key factors defining
the efficiency of a DSSC.5 The key features
of the effective sensitizers are the absorption of solar radiation
in the wide wavelength, a strong dye-semiconductor electronic coupling
which leads to favorable electron transfer from the dye’s excited
state to the semiconductor and strong anchoring of the dye to the
semiconductor surface. The search of an efficient dye stimulates the
theoretical calculations to predict its properties prior to the actual
synthesis of the metal–organic complex.

The long-term
stability of a DSSC depends on the dye/electrolyte
combination. Organic nitriles are commonly used for electrolyte with
acetonitrile being the most representative. The typically employed I3–/I– redox couple remains far from an “ideal”
one due to the volatility of I2 in equilibrium with I3–.6 Currently, redox mediators based on transition-metal complexes with
bi-, ter-, and quaterpyridines7 are actively
studied as a suitable alternative. Metal polypyridines are also applicable
in bioassays, catalysts, functional supramolecular materials, and
so forth.8−10 A transition metal in a coordination compound adopts
either the high or low ground spin state, which is manifested in particular
photophysical properties. Determining the spin of a ground state helps
to predict the physicochemical properties of novel coordination compounds.11 Sometimes, it turns into a challenging task
due to a spin transition phenomenon.12−16

Ruthenium,17−19 iron,20−23 and cobalt24−26 are found to
be the most suitable metals for utilization
in DSSCs. Although Ru(II) polypyridines have proven their high efficiency
as chromophores, further research continues with the aim to replace
ruthenium with a cheaper, less toxic, and more abundant metal center.
Fe(II)-based photosensitizers have met these requirements27,28 with a drawback of very short-lived excited states.11,29−31 Another promising family of efficient redox mediators
is Co(III/II) polypyridines.24,25,32−35 To the best of our knowledge, the dicarboxyl quaterpyridine complexes
of Ru, Fe, and Co have never been studied (nor experimentally neither
theoretically) under a single methodology, scarce examples of a systematic
study include a couple of works on Fe(II), Ru(II), and Os(II) carbonyl
derivatives of porphyrins36 and a paper
on pentacyano pyridines of Fe(II) and Co(II).37

Thiocyanates are commonly employed as ligands to construct
the
octahedral coordination sphere of the metal.38−40 The dyes containing
NCS– ligands have a broad absorption spectrum,41 where the level of frontier molecular orbitals
(MO) allows for effective electron injection into the conduction band
(CB) of semiconductor support. The way of bonding (through the N-
or S-atom) of the thiocyanate molecule to the metal center affects
the absorption profile of the polypyridine complex; the issue is still
poorly addressed in the literature. The reported cases are limited
to the N-bonded thiocyanate axial ligands42 and some others.43,44

The development of the
DSSCs has been accompanied by computational
chemistry studies that helped to rationalize the relationship between
the chemical structure and device performance. Photophysical properties45−49 of dye molecules have been extensively studied using density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), with the scope to identify
the complexes with a broad absorption spectrum and favorable electron
transfer from the photoexcited dye to semiconductor support. Theoretical
studies also permitted calculation of the redox potentials for perspective
electron mediators.50,51 Prediction of the correct spin
ground state prior to the actual synthesis of the complex enables
the rational design of chromophores with desired properties.52

The choice of the exchange–correlation
functional is important
for an accurate description of the electronic and spatial structures
of the complexes in different spin states and the HOMO–LUMO
energy gap.45 Pure DFT functionals, such
as PBE, usually underestimate the energy gap. Hybrid functionals with
an admixture of exact Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange such as B3LYP,
B3LYP*, and TPSSh give a better description of the electronic structure.
Stabilization of the HS state is proportional to the fraction of the
exact exchange admixture (C). The generalized gradient approximation
exchange functional OPBE was also reported to give correct predictions
of spin-state energies for transition-metal complexes.53−55 Swart12 studied an extensive set of small
iron-based model systems and five larger complexes, including [Fe(phen)2(NCS)2], and achieved the best agreement between
the experiment and theory with OPBE. For some iron complexes, the
double-hybrid density functional with corrections from second-order
many-body perturbation theory B2PLYP (with 53% of HF exchange) was
able to provide qualitatively correct results of spin-state energetics.52 To obtain very accurate and reliable calculations
for transition-metal complexes, one must implement post HF methods
such as the coupled cluster with single and double and perturbative
triple excitations (CCSD(T)), complete active-space self-consistent
field (CASSCF), complete active-space self-consistent field second-order
perturbation theory (CASPT2). Unfortunately, because of extreme time-consuming
nature, their application is limited to small molecules and they cannot
be adopted for geometry optimization. More frequently, these methods
are used for single-point calculation, and at the same time, the obtained
results are very sensitive to initial input data (coordinates of atoms,
number of MOs, and electrons in active space). DFT methods are computationally
less demanding and will remain a choice for all types of quantum-chemical
calculations providing an efficient prediction of the spatial and
electronic structures of the complexes in the ground and excited states.56,57 However, there is a development of the less time-consuming post
HF method such as correlation methods using the concept of the local
pair natural orbital, domain-based local pair natural orbital CCSD
[DLPNO-CCSD(T)].58 This method implements
only to the ORCA program package, and there are not a lot of articles
devoted to the calculation of the transition-metal complexes by this
level of theory.

In this paper, we study [M(dcqtpy)E2]n+ (M = Ru(II), Fe(III)/(II), Co(III)/(II),
dcqtpy = 4′,4″-dicarboxyl-4,4‴-dimethyl-2,2′:6′,2″:6″,2‴-quaterpyridine,
E = NCS– or SCN–). The complexes
have the pseudo-octahedrally surrounded metal center coordinated by
four N-bonding atoms of dcqtpy and by two axial thiocyanate ligands
through the N- or S-bonding atoms depending on isomerism. The chelating
geometry of dcqtpy forces it to occupy four in-plane coordinative
positions, constituting a basal plane of the complex.

The bold
numbers below identify the complex by the metal center
and by bonding atoms of the CNS ligands. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations
were performed on the full sequence of generated [M(dcqtpy)E2] (Scheme 1) by varying
the type of metal and its oxidation state, the bonding atom of the
CNS ligands, and the spin state of the complex. The electronic structure,
and total and relative energy of different spin states, as well as
the absorption spectrum, were calculated by optimizing the functional
and basis sets to reach a good match with experimental data available
in the literature. The calculations were performed by the Gaussian
program to trace the trends of energy difference values between high
and low spin (LS)-state (ΔEHS–LS) values in dependence of the axial ligand isomerism. We conclude
with a systematic computational study of photophysical properties
of quaterpyridine coordinative compounds with most important transition
metals, providing insights into the development of highly-efficient
DSSCs.

Scheme 1 General Structure of the Studied Complexes
2 Results and Discussion
The results are presented in the following manner: first, the spin
states of the complexes are discussed in respect to DFT calculations
of the energy difference between the HS and LS spin states, ΔEHS–LS. This is followed by evaluation
of the impact the amount of the exact exchange admixture in the hybrid
functional has on the energy of different spin states and on harmonic
vibrational frequencies of the complexes. A detailed analysis of the
structural parameters of the complexes in the HS and LS spin states
is given next. Then, we enter the issue of the CNS ligand isomerism
and its influence on the electronic structures and composition of
frontier orbitals. Finally, the TD-DFT calculated electronic absorption
spectrum for each complex will be presented.

2.1 Spin
States of the Complexes
The
exact determination of ΔEHS–LS with DFT remains a challenge, but it is still possible to qualitatively
predict the effect of ligand substitution on spin transition for structurally
related complexes.59 In a given complex,
the Ru(II), Fe(II), or Co(II) metal center is pseudo-octahedrally
surrounded by the tetradentate quaterpyridine ligand and by two monodentate
CNS ligands, realizing the HS or LS states depending on the ligand
field strength (Scheme 2). To calculate the energy of excited molecular complexes, it is
necessary to correctly determine the spin ground state, which is not
a trivial task.60,61

Scheme 2 Free Ion, and the
HS and LS Electron Configurations of the Ru, Fe,
and Co Metal Centers in an Octahedral Ligand Field
The calculated energy differences between the
HS and LS spin states,
ΔEHS–LS, for [M(dcqtpy)E2] are represented in Figure 1 and listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The bars follow the numbering order
in Scheme 1. The calculated
energies of spin states for [Ru(dcqtpy)E2] show that LS
is the most stable one; the respective ΔEHS–LS value exceeds 50 kcal/mol. However, Khusniyarov
and co-workers studying the low, high, and intermediate spin states
of the square-planar Ru(II) complexes based on the tP–C–P
pincer ligand had found that in some cases, the ground states were
the intermediate spin state (S = 1).62,63 The data for Ru(III)-based complexes were not calculated because
the impact of the ligand field strength on the t2g–eg splitting for Ru(III) complexes is very strong, and there
is no appreciable change in the ground spin state (LS in this case).

Figure 1 Bar charts
for DFT-calculated ΔEHS–LS values (kcal/mol) for the Ru-based (A), Fe-based (B), and Co-based
complexes (C) by using five different functionals. The complexes with
the metal center at a higher oxidation state (III) are marked with
the apostrophe symbol.

For 6′–9′, the stabilization
of the LS state is observed. For other complexes, ΔEHS–LS is not big enough for the LS ground state.
For 7 and 4′, the calculated values
(with all functionals) are negative numbers, indicative for the HS
ground state. As it can be clearly seen from Figure 1 and Table S1,
ΔEHS–LS increases when passing
from the N- to S-bonding atom in the CNS ligands. For [Ru(dcqtpy)E2], the same trend is observed with OPBE and TPSSh and the
opposite one when B2PLYP, B3LYP, and B3LYP* are used. It is worth
noting that ΔEHS–LS for 2 is the lowest among Ru(II) complexes. For the Co-based complexes,
the values of ΔEHS–LS are
negative for [Co(dcqtpy)E2] (excluding OPBE), while they
are positive for [Co(dcqtpy)E2]+, as can be
seen from Figure 1 and Table S1. This means that the ground state is
realized as the HS state for the former and as the LS state for the
latter. The ΔEHS–LS corrected
by the zero-point vibrational energy confirms the predicted ground
spin state obtained on the basis of the DFT calculations (Table S1).

The accuracy of the DFT calculation
of ΔEHS–LS for iron-based
complexes was addressed in
works of Hauser’s group.61,64,65 For small octahedral ferrous compounds (i.e., [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [Fe(NH3)6]2+), the ΔEHS–LS values obtained
in DFT were compared with those from CASSCF and CASPT2. For the large
bipyridine-based complexes or 2,2′-bis(2-mercaptophenylthio)
diethylamine dianion complexes, the DFT results were compared with
experimental data.54 The geometry parameters
calculated by hybrid and gradient-correction functionals were in good
agreement with those obtained by ab initio (CASSCF and CASPT2) calculations
or experiment. Unfortunately, the large size of SCO complexes prohibits
the use of detailed ab initio calculations. The possibility of using
DFT methods for studies of ligand field strength for Fe(II) polypyridines
has been reported by Jakubikova and Ashley.66

2.2 Impact of the Amount of the Exact Exchange
Admixture on Spin-State Energy and Vibrational Frequencies
The calculated relative stabilities of the HS and LS states are known
to depend on the amount of C in a hybrid functional, such as B3LYP.67 This hybrid functional often incorrectly favors
the HS state as a ground state. The amount of the exact exchange admixture
is the subject of some variation when describing the ionic complexes
of the first-row transition elements.46,68 For [Ru(dcqtpy)E2], [Fe(dcqtpy)E2], and [Co(dcqtpy)E2]+, ΔEHS–LS can
be defined as the energy difference between the optimized singlet
and quintet states, ΔEHS–LS = Equintet – Esinglet. Here, Equintet is
the total energy of the fully optimized 5T state, and Esinglet is the total energy of the fully optimized 1A state. For [Fe(dcqtpy)E2]+ and [Co(dcqtpy)E2], ΔEHS–LS can be
defined as ΔEHS–LS = Esextet – Edoublet and ΔEHS–LS = Equartet – Edoublet,
respectively. The ΔEHS–LS values were calculated at different amounts of C (a0 = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25) (Table S2). They are plotted in Figures 2, 3, and S1 in the Supporting Information as a function of C, the
same as in ref (68). The linear trends for all the complexes are formulated in Table S4.

Figure 2 Calculated energy differences between
the HS and LS states for
[Ru(dcqtpy)E2] vs C in the B3LYP functional.

Figure 3 Calculated energy differences between the HS and LS states
for
[Fe(dcqtpy)E2] vs C in the B3LYP functional for the Fe(II)
complexes (A) and the Fe(III) complexes (B). ΔEHS–LS > 0 corresponds to the LS ground state
(singlet
or doublet), ΔEHS–LS <
0 corresponds to the HS ground state (quintet or sextet).

Hybrid functional constructs from the combination
exchange and
correlation functionals may be written as69 1  

The HF exchange energy (ExHF) significantly
depends on spin
contribution. Because the HS states contain more spin orbitals of
one spin type than the corresponding LS state with the same number
of electrons, the HF exchange energy will tend to be greater for the
HS state because more contributing terms enter into the total energy.
It follows that an increase of the amount of the exact exchange admixture
in hybrid functionals will stabilize the HS state relative to the
LS state.

The situation for the pure DFT exchange is completely
different.
In the case of the d6 atom in octahedral coordination,
the answer to the question of whether this stabilizes the HS or LS
state depends upon the relative size of the Slater exchange magnitudes
for S = 0 and S = 2. Because the
eg orbitals are typically more diffuse than the t2g ones, the Slater exchange magnitudes for S = 2
can be smaller than that for S = 0. This is exactly
the opposite behavior from the exact exchange. Consequently, the LS
state will be stabilized relatively to the HS state when a0 is increased. The magnitude of the ΔEHS–LS dependence from the Slater exchange behaves oppositely
to the HF exchange, showing a positive slope.54

The obtained values of energy differences for the Ru(II) complexes
form linear dependencies ΔEHS–LS on C as shown in Figure 2 with trendlines. The trendlines have positive slopes, unlike
what has been reported by other authors.67,68 Such tendency would mean stabilization of the LS state with an increasing
amount of C. This influence is the most pronounced for 1 and 3 with the slope coefficients of 60.9 and 23.2,
respectively (see Table S4). Instead, there
is almost no correlation for 2 (with the slope coefficient
of just 2.2). These values, as well as those reported for other complexes
below, were obtained with the correlation coefficient R2 higher than 0.97 (Table S4).

As can be seen in Figure 3A, the ΔEHS–LS(C)
dependencies for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2] coincide well. The negative
slope of trendlines (the slope coefficients are from −121.2
to −146.2, see Table S4) implies
that increasing C stabilizes the states with higher multiplicities
and favors the HS state over LS. In such y–x-axes plots, the overestimation of ΔEHS–LS values is minimized in the proximity of y = 0, allowing to take the x-axis value
as an optimum.

The respective values are 0.154, 0.152, and 0.161
for 4, 5, and 6. The average
of the three gives
0.15. This is the optimum amount of C for the representative calculation
of iron-based complexes in different spin states. The obtained value
matches well that were found by others.70

Figure 3B shows
the trendlines for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2]+ arranged
in parallel (the slope coefficient is −100.6 in average, see Table S4) according to the difference in the
ligand field strength due to the alternative bonding of the CNS ligands.
The influence of the ligand field is more noticeable owing to the
higher oxidation state of iron.

The same but much less pronounced
effect is also observable for
[Fe(dcqtpy)E2] in the 0.05–0.15 interval, where
the ground state turns into the singlet LS state. Such distinct separation
in trendlines suggests that the Fe(III)-based compounds allow distinguishing
between the bonding atoms in the CNS ligand isomerism.

The higher
C contribution will increase the effective net charge
on the Fe(II) metal center. For C rising from 0.05 to 0.25, the effective
charge for the LS and HS states increases approximately 1.5 times
for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2] (see Table S3). This would result in the strengthening of the Fe–E bond
covalency and widening of the t2g–eg splitting.
The higher oxidation state of iron leads to better stabilization of
the LS state, which becomes the ground state for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2]+. This does not exclude a possibility for 4′ to acquire the HS state (Figure 3B). As we can see from Table S4, the slope coefficient strongly depends on the difference
of the spin multiplicities: S = 0 compared to S = 2 in the case of Fe(II) complexes, yielding a larger
slope than S = 1/2 compared to S = 5/2 in the case of Fe(III)-complexes.71

The dependencies ΔEHS–LS(C) for the Co-based complexes were found similar to the Fe(II/III)
compounds and reported in Figure S1. Trendlines
express a linear decline with the increasing C factor. There are crossing
trendlines for [Co(dcqtpy)E2] (the slope coefficients are
from −62.4 to −115.0, Table S4) and parallel ones for [Co(dcqtpy)E2]+ (the
slope coefficient is −74.0 in average, see Table S4).

As a cautious note, because ΔEHS–LS for Ru-based complexes is much
bigger than for Fe or Co-based complexes,
the Slater exchange part has a bigger impact in the total energy instead
of HF exchange which leads to opposite slope in the trendlines.

It is known that theoretically determined vibrational frequencies
often overestimate the experimental fundamental frequencies.72,73 The deviation between the calculated and fundamental frequencies
has a systematic character, allowing us to determine the uniform multiplicative
scale factors to match theoretically calculated and experimentally
obtained values.74 The recommended values
are tabulated in ref (75). Unfortunately, the scale factors for some functionals and the combined
basis set have not yet been published. For complexes with NCS– anions, the C=N stretching region is characteristic
for the spin state of the iron(II) center.76 It has been demonstrated that the iron-based complex with the N-bonded
thiocyanates in the HS state has an absorption band between 2020 and
2080 cm–1, while the appearance of a band at ∼2100
cm–1 stands for the LS ground state.77−81 In the latter case, the shorter iron–ligand distances lead
to higher binding energy and higher stretching frequency compared
to the HS state.

Taking all this into account, we calculated
the ν(C=N),
ν(C=O), and ν(O–H) frequencies in [Ru(dcqtpy)
(NCS)2] by using different functionals and a combined basis
set, comparing them (without the use of any scale factor) with experimentally
measured values.82 The values are shown
in Table 1 and Figure 4. As one may see,
the B3LYP frequencies at different C significantly deviate from the
experimental value. The best match has been reached at C = 0.15 with
a deviation of 0.6, 1.6, and 6.5% for ν(C=N), ν(C=O),
and ν(O–H), respectively. The smallest deviation in 1.87%
for ν(O–H) was obtained with C = 0.1. Taking the higher
C leads to the greater overestimation in frequency as was also shown
by Laury et al.73 This tendency is caused
by decreasing of the bond length at different amounts of C in the
hybrid functional (Table S6). The discrepancy
with TPSSh and OPBE is about 3–3.5%; meaning a need for a scaling
factor.

vibrational frequencies and their intensities were calculated
for the ν(C=N) bond in 4–6 and are
listed in Table S5. Both HS and LS states
were considered by applying TPSSh, OPBE, and B3LYP with different
amounts of C. The obtained values are within the range of those found
experimentally for similar structures. The closest match has been
reached for the frequencies calculated with B3LYP*.

2.3 Geometry Parameters of the Complexes
Previous studies
on quaterpyridines and their complexes with transition-metal
ions9,83 showed that the 2,2′:6′,2″:6″,2‴-quaterpyridine
and its derivatives tend to form mononuclear complexes with metal
ions in octahedral or square-planar coordination geometry. According
to the ligand field theory, the extent of ligand field splitting between
two sets of energies (t2g and eg orbitals) is
determined by the nature of the central atom and its ligands. The
separation in energy defines the ground-state electron configuration
(HS or LS) in a coordination complex as well as ΔEHS–LS. Complexes with the more covalent character
of metal–ligand bonds express larger structural differences
between their HS and LS states.

The geometries of [M(dcqtpy)E2] and [M(dcqtpy)E2]+ (Scheme 1) were DFT-optimized, and calculated
metal–ligand bond lengths are listed in Tables S7 and S8. They are compared with experimental data
for the similar complexes available in the literature (Table S7). The calculated angles are given in Table S9. The complexes (in their ground state)
are further visualized in polyhedral sketches based on calculated
geometry parameters (Figures S2–S4).

There are two trends that can be identified. It is known
that oxidation
of the metal ion from (II) to (III) leads to shortening of bond lengths
between the metal center and axial ligands, with no appreciable changes
in the basal plane (data are not shown). Lowering of the spin state
from HS to LS results in shortening of all coordination bonds in the
metal-centered polyhedron. The last effect might be due to the strain
induced by the presence of thiocyanate adducts on positions deviating
from those in an ideal octahedron. The difference in bond lengths
for the HS and LS states becomes more pronounced in the case of the
S-bonded CNS ligands.

The angle between two axial ligands, E1–Fe–E2, depends very tightly on the
exact exchange admixture and
accounting the MeCN medium. Its dependencies on C for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2] and [Fe(dcqtpy)E2]+ are shown in Figure 5, while the exact
values can be found in Table S9. Connected
by trendlines, the calculated values demonstrate rather a linear growth
with increasing C. The effect is the most evident for 4 and 5 in the HS state, with the values of 9 and 7%,
respectively. The increase is insignificant (3.6%) for 6. The respective equations are provided in Table S10 together with the correlation coefficient, whose high values
(R2 > 0.98) further confirm the linear
character. There is no distinct dependency found for these complexes
in the LS state; they demonstrate minor changes of 3.8, 2.7, and 1%
for 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

Figure 5 Calculated
values of the E1–Fe–E2 angle for
[Fe(dcqtpy)E2] in the HS state vs amount C
in B3LYP.

Rise of the Fe oxidation state
to (III) weakens the dependence
for 4, 5, and 6 in the HS state
with the angle differences of 5.4°, 0.7°, and 0.1°,
respectively. The similar linear dependences were observed in the
iron(II) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) complex on HS and LS.61 Further geometry optimization of the Fe-based
complexes in MeCN by standard B3LYP results in a noticeable increase
of the E1–Fe–E2 values, as shown
in Table S9.

Hence, the calculated
values of the geometry parameters for the
coordination polyhedrons of the complexes comply well with those experimentally
determined for similar molecules (Table S7). Relatively small deviations between the calculated and experimental
structures suggest that the chosen methodology suits well for determination
of [M(dcqtpy)E2] molecular structures. It comes from calculations
that a given metal–ligand bond length can be further used (with
some obvious limitations) for determination of oxidation and spin
states in respective [M(dcqtpy)E2]. The influence of the
amount of C affects not only on ΔEHS–LS but also on geometry parameters. This influence is more pronounced
for the geometry parameters (Table S10).

2.4 Impact of CNS-Ligand Isomerism on the Energy
of the Complexes
Thiocyanate is an ambidentate ligand that
can coordinate to a metal center either via the sulfur atom or the
nitrogen atom.84,85 For instance, the sulfur group
of the thiocyanate Ru-based sensitizers may enter in close contact
with the iodide redox couple of the electrolyte, helping to regenerate
the dye.42 Despite this advantage, thiocyanates
bind weakly to the Ru(II) center. In a working photovoltaic device,
they can be easily substituted by other additives to the electrolyte,
such as 4-tert-butylpyridine, commonly used as an
efficiency enhancement agent.86 A DSSC
based on an NCS-free sensitizer exhibits almost 50% lower efficiency
than that with it because of a 30 nm blue-shift.87

The search for any (Ru, Fe, Co)-thiocyanate compounds
in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)88 returns the results visualized in Figure 6. The grouping is based on the binding mode
of the ambidentate ligand; details about search queries and selection
of results are provided in description to Figure S5. Among the Ru-centered complexes, there are 71 unique compounds
with the Ru–NCS bonding, 6 others with the Ru–SCN bonding,
and no items with the NCS–Ru–NCS bonding. The respective
numbers for the Fe- and Co-based complexes are 618-3-2 and 796-11-1,
respectively. There are also complexes with a bridging CNS ligand
connecting the same element metal centers (2 for Ru-, 14 for Fe-,
and 56 for Co-based). Such statistics evidence that complexes with
alternatively bonded thiocyanate ligands are rare, with the most records
about the complexes with the N-bonded (majority) and the S-bonded
CNS ligands. Another conclusion is that among the available compounds,
thiocyanates are preferentially N-bonded.

Figure 6 Bar chart (not in the
same scale) comparing the number of items
in the Cambridge Structural Database88 of
the Ru-, Fe-, or Co-based complexes with differently bonded CNS ligands.
Color legend: black—the N-bonded ligands, red—the S-bonded
ligands, yellow—alternatively bonded ligands, and blue—the
bridging ligand. The details are given in the text.

To find out the preferred binding mode of the axial
ligands in
[M(dcqtpy)E2], the respective total energy was computed
(see Table S12) by using different functionals.
Then, the relative energies were calculated as the difference between
the most negative value of total energy among all the complexes and
the total energy of every complex. They are summarized in Table 2.

for [M(dcqtpy)E2] as Predicted by Different Functionals

9′	Co(III)	7.08	4.99	7.73	7.53	4.84	
As it clearly comes from the presence of zero values
in Table 2 that N-bonding
of
the CNS ligand is preferable for all the metal centers (Ru, Fe, and
Co). Increasing values of relative energy when any or both of the
CNS ligands became the S-bonded reflect that destabilization occurs
in the complex. It is about 5 kcal/mol for the Ru-centered and 7 kcal/mol
for both Fe- and Co-based complexes.

Such energy difference
is negligible, and a stabilizing input can
come from the crystal lattice or from the solvent molecules. This
allows for the existence of compounds with the alternatively bonded
CNS ligands. The complexes with S-bonded CNS ligands (3, 6, 6′, 9, 9′) are destabilized more than 10 kcal/mol comparing to 1, 4, 4′, 7, 7′ (with N-bonded CNS ligands) and are less likely to occur.

The solvation enthalpies and free energies were calculated for
all complexes in MeCN solution (Table S13). Using B3LYP, B3LYP*, and TPSSh functionals, the thermodynamic
parameters for the isomerization reactions [M(dcqtpy)(NCS)2] → [M(dcqtpy) (NCS)(SCN)] and [M(dcqtpy)(NCS)2] → [M(dcqtpy)(SCN)2] were calculated. The possibility
of using such an approach is proved in the research.43 It was found that in the case of the ruthenium polypyridyl
complex, the theoretical values of ΔH is 7.18
kcal/mol and ΔG is 8.18 kcal/mol is indicated
for possibilities of obtaining the S and N isomers. Experimental values
of thermodynamic parameters were 3.65 and 2.49 kcal/mol, respectively.

The values of enthalpies and free energies for 3, 6, 6′, 9, 9′ complexes are quite big; thus, the probability of isomerization
reactions [M(dcqtpy)(NCS)2] → [M(dcqtpy)(SCN)2] by changing the temperature or solvent is low.

2.5 TD-DFT Calculations of Absorption Spectra
Both B3LYP
and PBE089 functionals were
used for TD-DFT calculations of absorption (electronic) spectra of
[M(dcqtpy)E2] in MeCN medium. These spectra were simulated
for [Ru(dcqtpy)E2] in the LS state and for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2] and [Co(dcqtpy)E2] in the HS state as the most
stable forms according to the calculated total energy. Most of the
calculations with TD-DFT are confined to the systems with a closed
shell ground state, but it has been applied for studies of small open-shell
transition-metal complexes too.90 The excitation
energies obtained with TD-DFT match experimental results with an error
of ∼0.3–0.5 eV.91 The Pápai
et al. studied the excited states of the Fe(II) complexes by the same
theoretical approach.92 The calculated
optical transitions (fosc > 0.01) for
[M(dcqtpy)E2] are given in Tables S14–S16. Simulated absorption spectra for [M(dcqtpy)E2] are shown
in Figures S22 and S23, while representative
curves for each metal (one out of three, all with different bondings
of the axial ligands) are presented in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Calculated UV–vis spectra for 1 in the LS state
and 4 and 7 in the HS state in MeCN. Characteristics
of the transitions at λ ≥ 250 nm for these complexes.

For the effective photoelectron
injection from the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) to the CB of semiconductors, the former energy
level should be higher than −3.2 eV [CB of TiO2 (anatase)].93 Also, the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) level should be more negative than −4.7 eV (the redox
potential of the iodine redox couple) allowing for the reduction of
a sensitizer. Because the main electronic excitations occur from HOMO
to LUMO, it is important to form the efficient charge-separated states
in a compound with HOMO and LUMO localized on the donor and acceptor
fragments of the complex, respectively.82 The energy diagram and discussion of MO for [M(dcqtpy)E2] are shown in Figures S6 and S7, and
calculated values are given in Table S14.

UV–vis spectra of [Ru(dcqtpy)E2] contain
two
regions of high absorption falling within 300–350 and 460–580
nm. By moving from 1 to 3, bands shift toward
higher energies and their separation shortens. The most intense band
centered at 329, 323, and 303 nm for 1, 2, and 3, respectively, is caused by a singlet–singlet
electron transition. The analysis of frontier orbitals shows that
this transition has a mixed character of L′LCT (ligand–ligand
charge transfer), where L′ is the Ei ligand and L is dcqtpy. The second intensive electron transition
has a MLCT character with a small admixture of ILCT (intraligand charge
transfer). In particular, for 1, the bands at 534, 516,
and 488 nm are formed by two transitions of the mixed MLCT character
between the same HOMO – 1/HOMO set and the higher-lying LUMO
+ 1/LUMO + 2. For 2, the similar transition was obtained
at 511.9 nm, and it has a combined MLCT and L′LCT nature. For 3, the band stands at 453.9 nm. It is interesting that electron
transfer occurs from d-orbitals of the Ru-center and from π-orbitals
of the CNS ligands to π* orbitals of dcqtpy, the last with sufficient
contribution from atomic orbitals (AO) of two −COOH groups.
The carboxylic acid group serves as an anchor, which binds the sensitizer
molecule to a semiconductor surface, thus, allowing for IET. A low-intensity
broad band at about 700 nm corresponds to the first transition in
MLCT. The main absorption features of 1 (Figure 7 and Table S15) reproduce well those of the experimental spectrum.82

[Fe(dcqtpy)E2] exhibit their
most intense absorption
bands at 353, 372, and 354 nm. These bands are due to the ILCT transition,
where the electron density transfers from HOMO delocalized on AO of
dcqtpy to the correspondent LUMO with contribution from the −COOH
groups. The lower energy shoulders (at 422, 455, and 456 nm for 4, 5, and 6, respectively) are due
to the electron transition from β-HOMO – 1 to LUMO +
1. The analysis of the excited state wave function reveals that for 4 and 5, the transitions are of the L′LCT
character, while for 6, there is a small contribution
from MLCT, as shown in Figures S9, S16–S18. In the 600–700 nm wavelength region, the absorptivity of 5 is the most intensive among the Fe(II) complexes (Table S16). Although being less intense than
Ru(II) in the LS state, the absorption profile of Fe(II) in the HS
state is beneficial for DSSC sensitizers because it covers the visible
range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Among considered, 5 possess the most attractive profile for applications in DSSCs.

The absorption spectra of [Co(dcqtpy)E2] consist of
two bands, the first stands at ∼360 nm and the second one falling
in the 430–480 nm range. Complexes have different charge-transfer
natures. Both 7 and 8 have the same ILCT
nature, where the electron density goes from pyridine rings bonded
to metal via N3 and N4 atoms to those with N1 and N2.

For 9, this is the MLCT band, which is caused by transitions
from metal t2g (dyz) to π*
of dcqtpy. The same transitions were involved in [Fe(dcqtpy)E2] reflected by rising absorption in the 350–370 nm
region. There is the L′LCT band at 484, 466, and 431 nm in
the spectra of [Co(dcqtpy)E2], respectively. These types
of spectra with a dominant absorbance in the near-UV range were quite
expected, considering the obtained ΔEHOMO–LUMO values.

During the studies, an unusual dependence of the absorption
profile
on the bond angle between the axial ligands has been observed for 5 (Figure 8). As we already mentioned in section 2.3, the axial angle increases with an increase
of amount C and after optimization of the geometry of the complexes
in MeCN. In fact, the profiles of absorption curves generated by TD-DFT
calculations for 5 in MeCN are very different from those
obtained for the isolated complex (in the gas phase).

Figure 8 Calculated UV–vis
spectra for 5 in the HS state
in the MeCN medium. Curves 5 (black) and 5a (red) are
generated by TD-DFT at the B3LYP and PBE0 levels of theory, respectively,
using the optimized geometries for the gas phase. Curves 5b (green)
and 5c (blue) are generated accordingly, using the optimized geometries
for the MeCN medium.

In the MeCN medium, the molar absorptivity of the most intense
band becomes twice lower (by comparing curves 5b and 5c with 5 and 5a in Figure 8). Simultaneously, an absorption band of almost equivalent
intensity appears in the visible range (curves 5b and 5c in Figure 8). This particular
feature allows considering 5 as a perspective sensitizer
for DSSCs. Such dramatic changes also demonstrate that the environment
of the metal center and the type of the bonding atom in the CNS ligands
are critical for enhancing absorption in the visible region.

The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc)
are key parameters determining the photo-to-current efficiency
in DSSC. The first one depends on light-harvesting efficiency (LHE—light
harvesting efficiency at a certain wavelength). The LHE of the dye
should be as high as possible to maximize the photocurrent response.5 The calculated values are shown in Tables S15–S17.

From 7 to 9, the decreasing oscillator
strength leads to the decreasing LHE parameter of 0.313, 0.305, and
0.187, respectively. The decrease of the LHE factor is related to
the increasing broken planarity of the dcqtpy ligand. In the case
of Fe(II) complexes, the LHE is around from 0.416 to 0.434 which provides
by the absence of any significant changes of the planarity or dipole
moment of the transaction. The [Ru(dcqtpy) (SCN)2] complex
has the highest absorption efficiency between other complexes (LHE
= 0.522). The trend of increasing LHE is found to be: 3 > 1 > 4 > 6 > 5 > 2 > 7 > 8 > 9.

The calculation performed with PBE0 does
not show significant changes
in absorption curves but the same tendencies of the red-shift of the
main absorption band and of decrease in molar absorptivities (Figure S23). The calculated spectra support the
experimental observation of a bathochromic shift when moving from
the S-bonded isomer to the N-bonded configuration with only a slight
decrease in molar absorptivity. There is also a trend in the most
intensive light absorbents: for [Ru(dcqtpy)E2] 3 > 2 > 1, for [Fe(dcqtpy)E2] 5 ≈ 4 > 6 and
for [Co(dcqtpy)E2] 8 ≈ 9 > 7.

3 Conclusions
In the
present work, we studied the structure–property relationship
for Ru(II), Fe(III/II), and Co(III/II) quaterpyridines with the CNS
axial ligands. The DFT and TD DFT calculations with various functionals
were performed for the single molecules and with an account of acetonitrile
medium to define their ground state, geometries, and electronic absorption
spectra. Because the complexes are likely to be applied as photosensitizers
in DSSCs, our main attention was devoted to (a) determination of the
ground-state electron configuration (HS or LS) and of the ΔEHS–LS value for each complex and (b)
the study of the HOMO–LUMO gap and respective composition of
frontier MOs.

The arrangement of the CNS ligands was found decisive
for the ground
state of the complexes; the Ru(III/II), Fe(III) and Co(III) complexes
(1–3, 6′–9′)
are in the LS state, while the Fe(III/II) and Co(II) complexes (4–9, 4′, 5′) are in the HS state. When moving from the N- to S-bonding of the
CNS ligands, the ΔEHS–LS values
rise for the Fe(III/II) and Co(III/II) complexes. The ΔEHS–LS values and the amount of the exact
exchange admixture are linearly proportional. The covalence of the
Fe–E bonds found increasing with the growing amount of the
exact exchange admixture.

For all the studied complexes, the
S-bonded CNS ligand provides
the higher field strength than the N-bonded, what is reflected by
the larger ΔEHS–LS values
in the complexes 4, 6, 7–9, and 4′–9′. The N-bonding of CNS
ligands is energetically favored. A slight difference of 5–7
kcal/mol for the complexes 2, 5, and 8 allows for linkage isomerism of CNS ligands. The value of
the axial angle strongly depends on the exact exchange admixture;
this is more evident in the case of the MeCN medium. For 5, the axial angle decreases from 171.4 (for B3LYP with MeCN) to 160.9
(for the B3LYP single molecule), affecting the profile of the electron
absorption spectra. All complexes under the study comply with requirements
for sensitizers about the position of the frontier MO. The Fe(II)
complex with the alternatively bonded CNS ligands can be suggested
as the best alternative to the Ru-based complexes. The TD-DFT modeled
electronic absorption bands for 1 gave good coincidence
with previously reported experimental data.

The length of the
M–E bonds can be used to estimate the
oxidative and ground spin states of the complexes. Complexes with
the more covalent character of the metal–ligand bond demonstrate
noticeable structural differences when changing spin states, and their
ground state more markedly correlates with the amount of the exact
exchange admixture in the DFT functional.

These observations
suggest the importance of considering both the
ground spin state and the ligand field strength when choosing a sensitizer
from the transition-metal quaterpyridine complexes. The findings of
this work may have a practical significance for the development of
the new quaterpyridine complexes with improved performance for DSSCs.

4 Computational Methods
Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations
were performed without symmetry
constraints using Gaussian03/0994,95 program packages. Molecular
structures were initially obtained at the semi-empirical PM3 level
as starting input geometries. The geometry optimization for all functionals
without symmetry constraints on nuclear coordinates was performed.
All stationary points were identified as minimal (number of imaginary
frequencies Nimag = 0). The results of
frequency calculations were used to calculate zero-point energy at
298.15 K and 1.0 atm using standard statistical mechanical conventions.
The 40 lowest excitation states were chosen for TD-DFT calculations.
The calculations were performed in the gas phase and in the solvent
medium (acetonitrile, MeCN). The polarizable continuum model96 was adopted for the latter.

For quantum-chemical
modeling of the high spin (HS) and the LS
states, the hybrid exchange–correlation functionals were used.
DFT calculations for all the complexes with the nonsinglet state were
spin-unrestricted. The B3LYP,69 B3LYP*,71 TPSSh,97,98 OPBE,99 and B2PLYP100 functionals were
examined. Optimization of geometry and electronic structure of the
complexes was performed by a combination of Pople’s 6-311G(d)101,102 split-valence basis set with a sufficient level of accuracy103 and the Lanl2DZ effective core potential from
Los Alamos National Laboratory Lan family.104−106 Regarding the calculation of the absorption spectrum, we found that
previously published results of TD-DFT calculations for Ru-based complexes
with the Lanl2DZ basis set comply well with the experimental data.107 Hence, LanL2DZ has been used for all metals
in this work. 6-311G(d) was employed for nonmetals.

The structure
of the complexes was visualized in ChemCraft software.108 The Cartesian coordinates of atoms from quantum
chemical calculations were used as input parameters. The results from
TD-DFT calculations were employed to construct the molecular energy
levels and isodensity plots. Contributions of AO to MO of [M(dcqtpy)E2] were calculated by the Chemissian 4.01 program package.109 The AO to MO contribution was evaluated through
a direct LCAO-MO expansion. The threshold value was taken at 0.05.
The broadening of curves of the electron absorption spectra was simulated
by means of Gaussian distribution functions with the full-width at
half-maximum (fwhm) of 3000 cm–1. The molar absorptivity,
ε (L·mol–1·cm–1), was calculated in the GaussSum 3.0 program package using the following
equation110 2  where f is the oscillator
strength, ν is the wavenumber, and Δ1/2ν′
is the fwhm.
