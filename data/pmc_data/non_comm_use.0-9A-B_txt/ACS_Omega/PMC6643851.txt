Triblock copolymers poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA) with designed
molecular weight of PMMA and PEO blocks were synthesized via the activator
regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) atom transfer radical polymerization
(ATRP) of MMA. The Br-terminated Br–PEO–Br with the
molecular weights of 20k and 100k were used as  macroinitiators.
ARGET ATRP was performed with ppm level amount CuBr2 as
the catalyst and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent to overcome the
sensitivity to oxygen in a traditional ATRP. The molecular weight
of the PMMA block was manipulated by changing the molar ratio of monomers
to the Br–PEO–Br macroinitiators. The synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA and its structure was confirmed
by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR, and the molecular
weight of the PMMA block was determined by 1H NMR.
Aqueous solutions of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA were prepared by solvent-exchange, and their microstructures
were examined by tensiometry, static light scattering, and transmission
electron microscopy. The effects of molecular weight of the PMMA and
PEO blocks on the microstructure were elucidated.

Introduction
Associative polymers (APs) are polymers
with blocky segments that
have a tendency to associate in selective solvents.1 The APs can self-assemble to form different types of microstructures
as a result of their association in selective solvents, yielding some
very interesting properties. These systems have been exploited in
many applications, including controlled drug release, rheology modifier,
and polymer flooding for enhanced oil recovery.1−5 The APs are amphiphilic due to the presence of both
hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, resembling the structure of
surfactant.6,7 The hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments
self-associate to form a core–shell structure consisting of
a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic corona. Triblock copolymer APs
with BAB structure have attracted increasing attention due to their
unique structure and associative properties, where A is the hydrophilic
block and B is the hydrophobic block.8−11 When both ends of the BAB triblock
copolymers associate in dilute aqueous solution, they form a hydrophobic
“B” core and a hydrophilic “A” corona
with a flower-like micelle microstructure.9,11−13 The size and morphology of the flower micelle can
be tuned at the molecular level by manipulating the chemical composition,
architecture, and molecular weight.6

The control of the molecular weight of polymer is one the critical
issues in the polymer field, as it determines many properties of polymer
materials, such as manufacturing process and mechanical properties.
Many living radical polymerization methods have been developed to
synthesize polymers with precise molecular weight and low dispersity,
including nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization,14−16 organometallic mediated radical polymerization,17,18 reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization,19,20 and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).21−25 In all these living radical polymerization process,
the reactive polymer chain ends are preserved by a reversible reaction
between the active and dormant species, leading to a low and constant
concentration of the radicals. The reversible reaction in ATRP is
mediated by redox-active transition-metal complexes (i.e., CuI/ligand and CuII/ligand) as catalysts and alkyl
halides as initiators.21,26 ATRP is one of the most
popular living radical polymerization method because it is easy to
setup, efficient, robust, and tolerant to impurities and monomers
types.27 It has been extensively used to
synthesize polymers with well-controlled molecular weights and architecture,
such as block copolymer and star-like polymers.21,28−31

However, the apparent drawbacks of the classical ATRP limit
its
applications in the industry, where a relatively large amount of catalyst,
typically in the order of 0.1–1 mol % relative to monomer contents,
are normally used to achieve a well-controlled living radical polymerization
process.21 Thus, there is a significant
amount of catalyst present in the final products, and the removal
of metal complex is time-consuming and expensive. As the catalysts
are generally toxic, the removal is necessary before using the final
product. Sometimes, the residues of the catalyst are very difficult
to remove, and this severely limits the application of ATRP.32 Moreover, the catalysts used in the classical
ATRP are metal complexes at low valence states (i.e., CuBr),
which is unstable under ambient conditions. Therefore, the catalyst
for classical ATRP should be purified before use and then stored in
a glovebox filled with inert gas. Another significant drawback of
the classical ATRP is its sensitivity to oxygen, and tedious air-removing
procedures are necessary, such as freeze–thaw cycling.21,22 Several modifications of ATRP have been developed to address the
drawbacks of classical ATRP, such as simultaneous reverse and normal
initiation ATRP,33−35 activators generated by electron transfer (AGET)
ATRP,36,37 initiators for continuous activator regeneration
ATRP,38 electrochemical ATRP,39,40 microwave-assisted ATRP,41−43 supplemental activator and reducing
agents (SARA) ATRP,44−46 activator regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET)
ATRP,21,22,24,47−50 and metal-free ATRP.32,47,48,51 In ARGET ATRP, metal
complex at high valence states (i.e., CuBr2) are employed
and excess reducing agents are added to steadily regenerate Cu(I)
from Cu(II) as the catalyst. Compared to classical ATRP, ARGET ATRP
requires a much lower concentration of Cu and is less sensitive to
oxygen.21,24,52,53 Therefore, ARGET ATRP is a promising living radical
polymerization method to synthesize polymers with controlled molecular
weight and delicate designed architecture for industrial scale up.

Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is a widely used hydrophilic polymer
due to its significant water solubility and biocompatibility, and
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a promising hydrophobic polymer
due to its resistance to enzymatic attack, biocompatibility, appropriate
glass transition temperature, and high transmittance.8,10,13 Amphiphilic block copolymers
containing PEO as the hydrophilic blocks and PMMA as the hydrophobic
blocks are of great interest due to their many potential applications.8,52,54,55 BAB triblock copolymers poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA) with PEO and
PMMA blocks of various molecular weights were used as model systems
to study their association properties in aqueous solution. ATRP
has been widely used to synthesize triblock copolymers;8,31,56−58 however, there
is negligible report on the synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA via ARGET ATRP. Here, ARGET ATRP was used to prepare
PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA triblock copolymers
with designed molecular weights. Br-initiating sites were first introduced
to both ends of the PEO polymer chains to produce the macroinitiators
Br–PEO–Br with Mn of 20k
and 100k. The PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA
with designed molecular weight was then polymerized using Br–PEO–Br,
ppm level of CuBr2 and excess ascorbic acid as the macroinitiator,
catalyst, and reducing agent respectively. The molecular weight
of the PMMA block was controlled by tuning the molar ratio of MMA
to Br–PEO–Br and monomer conversion. Then, the association
of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA in an aqueous
solution, such as the microstructure, was studied. Moreover, the effect
of Mn of PEO and PMMA on the microstructure
of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA was also examined
and elucidated.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Mn of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA
The commercially
available PEO possesses hydroxyl terminal groups at both ends. Scheme 1 shows the representative
synthesis route of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA.
α-Bromoisobutyryl bromide (BIBB) was used to introduce Br-initiating
sites on both ends of PEO. Then, the Br–PEO–Br was employed
as the macroinitiator for the ARGET ATRP of MMA to synthesize PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA. The PEO with Mn of 20k or 100k was used as the hydrophilic A block in
the BAB triblock copolymers. The Br–PEO–Br macroinitiators
(P1 and P2) were synthesized via the esterification of PEO with BIBB
in dichloromethane (DCM) in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) and
deoxyadenosine monophosphate at room temperature. Excess BIBB was
used in the esterification reaction of PEO to ensure that all the
−OH groups of PEO were esterified to −C(CH3)2Br. The successful esterification of PEO by BIBB was
confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of P1 and
P2. As shown in Figure 1A, P1 and P2 showed typical bands of PEO at 2882 cm–1 (CH stretching), 1969 cm–1 (CH asymmetric stretching),
1466 cm–1 (CH2 scissoring), 1097 cm–1 (C–O–C stretching), 961 cm–1 (CH2 twisting), and 841 cm–1 (CH2 wagging). Moreover, the presence of the band at 1738 cm–1 in the FTIR spectra of P1 and P2 was attributed to
the stretching vibration of C=O, indicating the successful
esterification of PEO by BIBB.59 The structure
of P1 and P2 was also studied by 1H NMR. As shown in Figure 1B, the peak in the 1H NMR at 3.6 ppm was ascribed to the −O–CH2 of PEO. Compared to PEO, the P1 and P2 displayed a new peak
at 1.9 ppm, which was assigned to the −CH3 of the
−C(CH3)2Br moieties, suggesting the successful
synthesis of P1 and P2.8,60

Scheme 1 Schematic on the  Synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA and Its Proposed Association in Aqueous
Solution
The BAB triblock copolymer
PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA was synthesized
via ARGET ATRP using Br–PEO–Br
as the macroinitiator (Scheme 1). The ARGET ATRP of MMA was conducted with a small amount
of CuBr2 as the catalyst and excessive amount of ascorbic
acid as the reducing agent. The molar ratio of CuBr2 to
monomer is in the range of 50–250 ppm for the synthesis of
PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA, and the purification
of CuBr2 before use was not necessary. Compared to traditional
ATRP, the ARGET ATRP reaction significantly reduced the amount of
catalyst to ppm level. Because of the introduction of excess ascorbic
acid as the reducing agent (50 times the catalyst), the ARGET ATRP
was more tolerant to the presence of oxygen, and N2 purging
was sufficient to remove air. The molecular weight of PMMA block was
tuned by the molar ratio of MMA to the macroinitiator. Table 1 summarizes the molar ratio
of MMA to the macroinitiator in the ARGET ATRP and the targeted molecular
weight. For the synthesis of P3, P4, and P5, the molar ratio of MMA
monomer to P1 in the ARGET ATRP process were 100, 200, and 400, respectively.
Therefore, the targeted molecular weight of PMMA were 5k for P3, 10k
for P4, and 20k for P5. For the synthesis of P6, P7, and P8, the molar
ratios of MMA monomer to P2 in the ARGET ATRP process were 400, 1000,
and 2000, respectively. Thus, the target molecular weight of PMMA
were 20k for P6, 50k for P7, and 100k for P8.

b MMA conversion was calculated as
the ratio of Mn of PMMA block determined
by 1H NMR to the targeted Mn of PMMA block.

The successful
implementation of the ARGET ATRP was confirmed by
the synthesis of the final products, PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA. Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the macroinitiators and PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA copolymers. Compared to P1,
the FTIR spectra of P3, P4, and P5 displayed additional bands at 1728
and 750 cm–1, which were associated with the C=O
and methyl vibration of the PMMA blocks. Moreover, the intensity of
these two peaks increased with increasing Mn of the PMMA blocks. Similar phenomena were also observed for the
FTIR spectra of P2, P6, P7, and P8 (Figure 2B). The results confirmed the successful
synthesis of the triblock copolymers via ARGET ATRP and the Mn of the PMMA blocks increased with the feeding
molar ratio of the MMA monomers to macroinitiator Br–PEO–Br.

P6, P7, and P8.

To calculate the molecular
weight of the PMMA block, the structure
of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA was examined
by 1H NMR, as shown in Figure 3. Comparing the 1H NMR of P1 to
that of P3, P4, and P5 revealed additional peaks at 3.6, 1.8, 1.0,
and 0.8 ppm, which were attributed to −O–CH3 (e), −CH2 (e), and −CH3 (d)
of the PMMA blocks.31 The intensity of
these peaks increased with increasing Mn of the PMMA blocks. According to the integral area of PMMA to the
PEO in the 1H NMR spectra and the Mn of PEO, the Mn of the PMMA was
calculated using the following equation  where Ie, Ic, and Id are the
integrals of the corresponding e, c, and d protons of the PMMA blocks, Ia+b is the integral of the a and b protons of
PEO, and 44 and Mn(PEO) is the molecular
weight of the repeating units of PEO and PEO, respectively. The monomer
conversion of MMA in the ARGET ATRP could be deduced based on the
calculated Mn and the target Mn of PMMA block using the following equation  The calculated Mn of PMMA and corresponding
monomer conversion are summarized in Table 1. The Mn of PMMA
in P3, P4, and P5 was 3.7k, 7.8k, and 11.1k,
respectively. The monomer conversion for the polymerization of P3
and P4 was reasonably high (74.0 and 78.0%, respectively), and the
monomer conversion of P5 was moderate (55.5%). Similar 1H NMR spectra were obtained for P2, P6, P7, and P8. The Mn of PMMA blocks in P6, P7, and P8 determined from the 1H NMR spectra were 7.9k, 19.3k, and 32.2k, respectively. For
the ARGET ATRP from P2, a medium monomer conversion (30–40%)
was obtained for all the three polymers.

Associative Microstructures
of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA in Aqueous
Solutions
The triblock copolymer
PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA cannot be directly
dissolved in water due to the long hydrophobic and high glass transition
temperature of the PMMA block. The aqueous solutions of triblock copolymer
were prepared by first dissolving the triblock copolymer in tetrahydrofuran
(THF), followed by the slow addition of water at a rate of one drop
every 10 s under vigorous stirring. After removing the THF via
rotary evaporation, the aqueous triblock copolymer solutions were
obtained. Figure 4 shows
the optical images of triblock copolymer aqueous solutions at a concentration
of 0.1 wt %. For P3, P4, P5, and P6, the triblock copolymer aqueous
solutions were transparent. However, the aqueous solutions of P7 and
P8 were turbid, and precipitation was observed after 24 h due to the
high amount of physical cross-linking formed in P7 and P8 aqueous
solution.

Figure 4 Optical images of triblock copolymer aqueous solution at the concentration
of 0.1 wt %.

The surface tension of
the triblock copolymer aqueous solution
was also studied as a function of concentration from 0 to 0.25 g/L.
As shown in Figure 4C, the surface tension of all the triblock copolymer aqueous solutions
decreased dramatically with concentration in the very dilute range
of 0–0.003 g/L. The surface tension of the solution decreased
from 72 to about 63 N/m at the concentration of 0.003 g/L. However,
when the concentration was greater than 0.003 g/L, the surface tension
decreased slowly with polymer concentration. The surface tension of
PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA aqueous solution
indicated that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of these six
triblock copolymers was about 0.003 g/L, and the CMC value was consistent
with the CMC of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA
determined by fluorescence spectroscopy  using pyrene
as the probe.31 At the concentration
above 0.1 g/L, the copolymer P3, P4, and P5 exhibited a lower surface
tension than P6, P7, and P8 (Figure 5). Among them, P4 displayed the lowest surface
tension of about 50 N/m at the concentration of 0.25 g/L (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Surface tension of polymer
aqueous solutions as a function of concentrations.

The translation diffusion coefficient (DT) and the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of
supernatant of the triblock copolymer aqueous solution were determined
by dynamic light scattering. The intensity as a function of log τ
at various scattering angles of these six triblock copolymer
solutions is shown in Figure 6. The calculated DT and Rh are summarized in Table 2. The Rh of P3,
P4, and P5 were in the range of 30–40 nm, and the Rh of PMMA-b-PEO20k-b-PMMA increased slightly with the Mn of PMMA. The Rh of P6, P7, and
P8 were much larger than that of P3, P4, and P5 and in the range of
110–170 nm. Moreover, the Rh of
PMMA-b-PEO100k-b-PMMA also increased
with the Mn of PMMA. Therefore, the Rh of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA increased with the Mn of both PEO
and PMMA, and the Mn of PEO showed a much
greater influence than the Mn of PMMA.

The microstructures of the triblock copolymers in
the dilute aqueous
solution were studied from their transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of the corresponding supernatant solution, and they are
summarized in Figure 7. Scheme 1 also shows
the schematic association of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA in an aqueous solution. The triblock copolymers self-assembled
into polymer micelles in dilute aqueous solution, and bridges were
formed among the micelles above the critical percolation concentration.61 According to the TEM images, all six triblock
copolymers formed bridges between the micelles at the concentration
of 0.01 wt %. Therefore, the percolation concentration of these six
triblock copolymers should be below 0.01 wt %. The formation of bridges
between flower micelles in the aqueous solution is beneficial in providing
additional viscosity to the rheology modifier for application in  enhanced
oil recovery.2,62,63 The presence of bridges allowed us to only estimate  the
diameter of the formed micelles. The diameters of the micelles formed
in the P3, P4, and P5 aqueous solution were about 20–30 nm,
whereas that formed in the P6, P7, and P8 were about 60–90
nm. PMMA-b-PEO100k-b-PMMA showed
bigger micelles than PMMA-b-PEO20k-b-PMMA, which was consistent with the DLS results.

Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
with Mn = 20k or 100k, triethylamine (TEA),
dichloromethane
(DCM), 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), α-bromoisobutyryl bromide
(BIBB), methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2,2′-bipyridyl, CuBr2, ascorbic acid, THF, diethyl ether, and deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3) were purchased from Sigma. MMA was purified by
passing through a basic Al2O3 column to
remove the inhibitors. Other chemicals were used as received.

Synthesis of Macroinitiator Br–PEO–Br (P1 and
P2)
For the preparation of Br–PEO20k–Br (P1)
with the Mn of PEO of 20k g/mol, the PEO
(Mn = 20k, 100 g, 5 mmol) was dissolved
in DCM (400 mL), followed by the addition of TEA (2 g, 20 mmol) and
DMAP (2.44 g, 20 mmol). The mixture was cooled to 0 °C in an
ice-bath. Then, the solution of BIBB (4.33 g, 20 mmol) in DCM (50
mL) was added dropwise over a 30 min period. The esterification was
conducted at room temperature. After 24 h, the Br–PEO20k–Br
was precipitated in 10-fold of cold diethyl ether under constant stirring.
The polymer P1 was filtered and washed three times with diethyl
ether, and the white powder P1 was obtained by drying at 40 °C
under vacuum for 12 h.

For the preparation of Br–PEO100k–Br
(P2) with the Mn of PEO of 100k g/mol,
the esterification of PEO (Mn = 100k)
was performed using the similar procedure as P1. A viscous PEO solution
was obtained by dissolving PEO (Mn = 100k,
50 g, 0.5 mmol) in DCM (800 mL). Then, TEA (0.4 g, 4 mmol) and DMAP
(0.5 g, 4 mmol) were added. After the solution was cooled to 0 °C
in an ice-bath, the solution of BIBB (0.87 g, 4 mmol) in DCM
(30 mL) was added dropwise over a 30 min period. Then, the esterification
was conducted at room temperature for 24 h. The Br–PEO100k–Br
was precipitated in 10-fold of cold diethyl ether under constant stirring.
After filtering and washing three times with diethyl ether, the
final product P2 was obtained by drying in the oven at 40 °C
under vacuum for 12 h.

Synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO20k-b-PMMA (P3, P4, and P5)
P1 was used as the macroinitiator
to synthesize PMMA-b-PEO20k-b-PMMA
with various Mn of PMMA blocks via ARGET
ATRP. The targeted molecular weight of PMMA blocks in P3, P4, and
P5 were 5k, 20k, and 20k g/mol, respectively. Br–PEO20k–Br
(10 g, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in the mixture of toluene (100 mL)
and methanol (20 mL), followed by the addition of methyl methacrylate
(MMA, 5 g for P3, 10 g for P4, and 20 g for P5), bipyridyl (78 mg,
0.5 mmol), and CuBr2 (2 mg, 0.01 mmol). The mixture turned
green due to the presence of Cu(II). After purging with nitrogen for
20 min, ascorbic acid (88 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added and the mixture
immediately turned brown due to the formation of Cu(I). After
purging nitrogen for another 20 min, the temperature was raised to
70 °C to initiate the polymerization. After 24 h, the polymer
was precipitated in 10-fold of cold diethyl ether and washed
three times with diethyl ether. The final products were obtained by
drying at 40 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The molar ratios of MMA
monomer to P1 in the ARGET ATRP process for the synthesis of P3, P4,
and P5 was 100, 200, and 400, respectively.

Synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO100k-b-PMMA (P6, P7, and P8)
P2 was used as the macroinitiator
to synthesize PMMA-b-PEO100k-b-PMMA
with various Mn of PMMA blocks via ARGET
ATRP. The targeted molecular weight of PMMA block in P6, P7, and P8
were 20k, 50k, and 100k g/mol, respectively. P2 Br–PEO100k–Br
(10 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in the mixture of toluene (120 mL)
and methanol (50 mL), followed by the addition of methyl methacrylate
(MMA, 4 g for P6, 10 g for P7, and 20 g for P8), bipyridyl (78 mg,
0.5 mmol), and CuBr2 (2 mg, 0.01 mmol). The molar ratios
of MMA monomer to P2 in the ARGET ATRP process for the synthesis of
P6, P7, and P8 were 400, 1000, and 2000, respectively. After purging
with nitrogen for 20 min, ascorbic acid (88 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added.
After purging nitrogen for another 20 min, the polymerization was
conducted at 70 °C. After 24 h, the polymer was precipitated
in 10-fold of cold diethyl ether and washed twice with diethyl
ether. The final products were obtained by drying at 40 °C under
vacuum.

Preparation of Dilute Aqueous Solution of Triblock Copolymers
Triblock copolymer (50 mg) was dissolved in THF (5 mL), then Millipore
water (48 g) was slowly added at a rate of 1 drop every 10 s under
vigorous stirring. The THF was removed via rotary evaporation under
vacuum at room temperature for 2 h. The final solution was diluted
to 50 mL as the stock solution, and an aqueous triblock copolymer
solution (0.1 wt %) was obtained. The stock solution was further diluted
to prepare various concentrations of triblock copolymers.

Characterization
1H NMR spectra were recorded
using a Bruker AC-400 NMR at room temperature by dissolving the samples
in CDCl3. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR)
were obtained using Bruker Vertex 70. Surface tension was measured
via the tensiometer Data Physics DCAT 21 system at room temperature.
The dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments was performed on a
Brookhaven BI-200SM goniometer system equipped with a 522-channel
BI9000AT digital multiple τ correlator. The inverse Laplace
transformation of REPES in the Gendist software package was used to
analyze the time correlation functions with a probability of reject
set at 0.5. The deionized water used was from a Millipore Alpha-Q
purification system equipped with a 0.22 μm filter. A 0.8 μm
filter was used to remove dust before light scattering experiments,
and the experimental temperature was controlled by a PolyScience water
bath. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on
a Philips CM10 microscope at an acceleration voltage of 60 keV. The
TEM samples were prepared by drop coating the supernatant of triblock
copolymer aqueous solution (0.01 wt %) prepared by solvent exchange
onto copper grids (200 mesh coated with copper) and then drying the
samples overnight at ambient temperature.

Conclusions
The
triblock copolymers PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA were synthesized via ARGET ATRP with Br–PEO–Br
as macroinitiators. The ARGET ATRP reduced the amount of catalyst
and sensitivity to oxygen; therefore, the ARGET ATRP is more applicable
than traditional ATRP for scale up. Six triblock copolymers PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA with different Mn of PMMA and PEO blocks were synthesized by ARGET ATRP,
as confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR. The aqueous solutions
and hydrogels of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA
were formed via solvent-induced association. Then, the hydrodynamic
diameter, surface tension, and morphology of the aqueous solutions
were characterized by DLS, tensiometer, and TEM, respectively, and
the self-assembled nanostructures consisted of core–shell flower
micellar structures.
