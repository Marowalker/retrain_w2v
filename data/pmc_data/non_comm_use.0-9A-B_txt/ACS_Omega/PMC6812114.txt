A series of hybrid antimicrobial
compounds were prepared by carboxylic
acid protection of 6-aminopenicillanic acid using benzyl alcohol and
thionyl chloride succeeded by azide displacement using trifluoromethanesulfonyl
azide in dichloromethane. The azide thus formed was reacted with substituted
alkynes to furnish benzyl-protected penicillin–triazole conjugates.
Benzyl deprotection of the conjugates resulted in furnishing PNTCs
under water methanol mixture using Pd/C as a catalyst. The PNTCs (7a–j) formed were screened for in vitro antibacterial potency against pathogenic strains
of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes and antifungal potency against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus clavatus. Further antimicrobial evaluation
revealed compounds 7c, 7d, 7e, 7g, and 7i to be the most compounds of
the series with minimum inhibitory concentration value for antibacterial
in the range 0.5–50 μg/mL and for antifungal in the range
9–300 μg/mL. Toxicological analysis documented for compounds 7c, 7d, 7e, 7g, and 7i revealed compound 7i to be the most promising
member of the series with 1000 and 500 mg/kg LD50, and
no-observed-adverse-effect level to facilitate future clinical studies
of the same.

1 Introduction
Antimicrobials
are certainly one of the most flourishing forms
of chemotherapy in the history of medicine. With the serendipitous
discovery of penicillin in 1929 emerged the golden era of antibiotics.1 Armored with a high therapeutic window, the β-lactam
antibiotics reigned as an elite class of antimicrobials2 with penicillin enjoying the status of the most
frequently prescribed drug for over a decade.3 To date, β-lactams account for approximately 58% of consumed
packages of systemically administered antibacterial and approximately
63% of defined each day doses per 1000 inhabitants per day in the
hospital sector.4

Unfortunately in
consequence to this widespread use coincident
with increasing incidence of bacterial resistance, effectivity of
the safest antibacterial is severely compromised.5 Furthermore, β-lactams are also limited because of
poor acidic as well as alkaline stability. While the β-lactam
ring degrades in acidic gaster, the N-acyl side chain
of penicillin hydrolyzes to amine and acid derivatives in alkaline
medium. Accordingly, penicillin G, the most effective member of the
series,6 is administered via im injection
retarding both its usefulness and therapeutic compliance.7 Penicillin V and some semisynthetic penicillins
are modified for oral administration; however, they fail to attain
the therapeutic prowess of penicillin G. Thus, with the aim of challenging
the stated need of the hour, we have synthesized novel antimicrobial
agent with increased efficacy, decreased toxicity, and stability in
both acidic and alkaline media.

The rationale governing the
design concept of the study was that
replacing the amide bond in the β-lactam pharmacophore with
1,2,3-triazole would effectively address the problems associated with
clinical penicillin. The therapeutic fame of triazoles is dictated
by the profound pharmacological profile of the aromatic nucleus. In
the same context, the class of 1,2,3-triazoles is antimicrobial of
renowned efficacy.8 Additionally, the triazole
pharmacophore is an established class of antifungal agents.9 Thus, we hypothesized that introduction of 1,2,3-triazole
into penicillin’s would extend the pharmacological spectrum
of the β-lactam moiety to antifungal activity. Also since the
molecule is stable against both acidic and basic hydrolysis surrogates
of amide bond in penicillin, which triazole would render conjugates
with alkaline stability. As for the β-lactam instability in
acidic gaster, incorporation of triazole at N-acyl
side chain is known to decrease acid sensitivity of penicillin.10−15 Thus, for the purpose of exploiting the therapeutic advantage of
both penicillin and triazoles in the current investigation, we have
designed dual-acting heterodimeric penicillin-conjugated triazole
analogues on the basis of combinatorial synthesis by molecular hybridization
(Figure 1).

of different active parts of newly synthesized compounds
against bacterial and fungal infection.

A series of hybrid antimicrobial compounds were prepared by carboxylic
acid protection of 6-aminopenicillanic acid using benzyl alcohol and
thionyl chloride succeeded by azide displacement using trifluoromethanesulfonyl
azide in dichloromethane. The azide thus formed was reacted with substituted
alkynes to furnish benzyl protected PNTCs. Benzyl deprotection of
the conjugates resulted in furnishing PNTCs under water methanol mixture
using Pd/C as a catalyst. The prevailing imperative of the investigation
was to establish the efficacy and stability of the neoconjugates in
the context of both bacterial and fungal pathogenic strains along
with examining the onset and articulation of toxicity in vivo animal models. Relative potency of the predominant with the parent
molecule as well as clinical standard was also evaluated with the
aspiration to justify bench-to-bedside translation of the laboratory-created
molecules as potent and safe antimicrobial agent.

2 Results and Discussion
6-Azido penicillanic acid 4 was used as an intermediate
for the synthesis of PNTCs 7. The azide 4 and alkynes 5a–j used for the purpose
were synthesized using various protection and deprotection strategies.
The benzyl-protected PNTCs 6a–j were
synthesized in a Fritsch ball mill using copper sulfate and l-sodium ascorbate as a catalyst at 300 rpm. Deprotection of the ester 6a–j will furnish the desired PNTCs 7a–j.

2.1 Synthesis of 6-Azidopenicillanates 4 from 6-APA 1
For the conversion of
benzyl
(2S,5R,6R)-6-amino-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2-carboxylate 2 to benzyl (2S,5R,6R)-6-azido-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2-carboxylate 3, diazo transfer is a gentle and lofty yielding reaction.
Initially, these reactions were unsuccessful on unprotected 6-APA 1 as azide group was added on the amine as well as carboxylic
acid. Then, benzyl alcohol and thionyl chloride 2 were
used to protect carboxylic acid 6-aminopenicillanic acid 1 (Scheme 1). The required
carboxyl-protected 6-APA was synthesized adapting literature protocols.
Using the benzyl-protected aminopenicillanates, we synthesized protected
6-azidopenicillanates using freshly prepared triflic azide under basic
conditions in triethylamine, toluene solvent mixture. Desired azides 3 were obtained from carboxylic acid-protected amines in moderate
to good yields of 60–65%.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Benzyl-Protected 6-Azidopenicillanates
2.2 Cu(I)-Catalyzed Cycloaddition
Reaction between
Alkynes 5a–j and 6-Azidopenicillanates 4
To distinguish the optimum possible conditions
for Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition, reactions of azide 4 with 1-ethynyl-4-methoxybenzene 5a, 1-ethynyl-3-methoxybenzene 5b, (prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzene 5c and 1-ethynylcyclohexan-1-amine 5d, 1-ethynylcyclohexan-1-ol 5e, trimethyl(prop-2-yn-1-yl)silane 5f, N,N-dimethylprop-2-yn-1-amine 5g, N,N-diethylprop-2-yn-1-amine 5h, N,N-dipropylprop-2-yn-1-amine 5i, and N-butyl-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)butan-1-amine 5j were carried out in ball mill at 300 rpm. Our choice of
terminal alkynes is informed by the possibility that cycloaddition
between these azides 4 and alkynes 5a–j will, respectively, furnish triazolyl isosteres of penicillin
V 7a, ciclacillin 7b, and eight other useful
penicillin–triazole derivatives. Cu(I)-catalyzed reaction of
azide 3 with alkyne 4a–j resulted in triazoles 6a–j in excellent
yield. Benzyl ester deprotection of 6a–j results in furnishing the desired triazolyl compounds 7a–j in 70% overall yield (Scheme 2). We selected a subset of some terminal
alkynes which were closely related to penicillin’s derivatives.
Some of the alkynes were obtained from the commercial source, and
the remaining were synthesized using reported literature protocols.
Prop-2-yn-1-yloxybenzene 5c was synthesized after O-alkylation of phenol using propargyl bromide and sodium
hydride in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide.
Compounds 5a, 5b, and 5d–j were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carboxyl-protected 6-azido
penicillate was reacted with various alkynes to synthesize carboxyl-protected
triazolyl compounds. Ester deprotection of these synthesized compounds
furnishes the desired analogues of penicillin 7a–j.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Penicillin–Triazole Conjugate
2.3 Biological Evaluation
The synthesized
PNTCs were screened for in vitro antibacterial and
antifungal assays. For antibacterial screening, ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, while for antifungal activity, nystatin
and griseofulvin were used as reference standard. Intensive in vitro antimicrobial evaluation revealed 7c, 7d, 7e, 7g, and 7i to be the most active compounds of the series with minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) value for antibacterial and antifungal in the
range of 2.5–50 μg/mL (Table 1) and for antifungal in the range of 100–300
μg/mL (Table 1). Out of the varied substituent lined to the parent penicillin–triazole
scaffold, it was found that the tertiary amine-linked compounds 7g and 7i were relatively more potent than both
the reference standards. On the basis of the biological investigation,
it can be further deduced that on increasing the length of the N-alkyl chain (7g–i), the
potency of the compounds also exhibited an increasing trend. This
may be attributed to the increased penetrating power rendered to the
pharmacophoric lead due to long alkyl chain substitution of the parent
scaffold (Table 1).
Furthermore, it was observed that in comparison to aromatic substitution,
the compounds with aliphatic substitution at the pharmacophore nucleus
demonstrated enhanced biological activity. In lieu with the same compound, 7d with cyclohexylamine substitution was found to be the most
potent compound of the series followed by that of compound 7g with N-dimethyl substitution.

Also, in
contrast to the reference standard, the PNTCs 7b, 7c, 7d, 7g, and 7i exhibit
relatively low in vitro cytotoxicity to
human erythrocytes (Table 1). We then sought the in vivo toxicity profile
of the PNTCs in Wistar albino rats. To manifest the lethal dose (LD50) of the potent PNTCs, fixed-dose acute oral toxicity studies
were performed wherein the animals were dosed in progressive procedure
according to OECD TG 423 (Table 2).

a Median lethal dose
(LD50) of the most potent members of the PNTCs (7i) was found
to be 1000 mg/kg and no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL), 500
mg/kg.

From the study protocol,
it was observed that although compounds 7c, 7d, 7e, and 7g exhibited
slight epistasis at 300 mg/kg dose and mortality was observed on increasing
the dose to 500 mg/kg, LD50 could not be determined. On
the other hand, 300 and 1000 mg/kg doses were computed as LD50 for compounds 7d and 7i. Subsequent subacute
repeated dose toxicity studies according to OECD TG 407 were performed
to determine the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of the potent
PNTCs. The studies revealed that compound (7i) did not
reveal any toxic expression at dose 500 mg/kg. From the explored biological
and toxicological evaluation, it was observed that addition of triazole
moiety to penicillin resulted in reduction of toxicity of the PNTCs.

3 Experimental Protocols
3.1 Material
and Measurements
All reagents
and chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich and
used without further purification. Thin layer chromatography analyses
were performed on 0.2 mm Merck precoated silica gel 60 F254 aluminum
sheets, and the spots were visualized under a UV lamp. Final purifications
were performed using silica gel 60–120 mesh size. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were referenced to the internal
standard tetramethylsilane, in the respective deuterated solvents.
Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz. Processing
of the spectra was performed with Topspin software. High-resolution
mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Maxis spectrometer. Ultracentrifuge
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), autopipettes, and UV–vis spectrophotometer
were used for cytotoxicological studies. Standard antibiotics such
as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, Nystatin, and Griseofulvin were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich.

3.2 Representative Procedure
for Diazo Transfer
Reaction
3.2.1 Preparation of Catalyst Triflic Azide
Triflic anhydride (0.9 mL) was added dropwise to the solution of
sodium azide in water at 0–5 °C. The resultant mixture
was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. Finally, the triflic azide
was extracted with CH2Cl2 (5 mL × 3) and
washed with saturated sodium carbonate solution (10 mL). Dichloromethane
solution containing catalyst is used as such for furnishing carboxyl-protected
6-azido penicillate.

3.2.2 Synthesis of Carboxyl-Protected
6-Azido
penicillate
Benzyl ester of 6-aminopenicillanate (3 mmol)
was dissolved in dichloromethane (6 mL) in a round-bottom flask. Triethylamine
(8 mmol) and a solution of copper sulfate (0.4 equiv) were added to
a container successively. Freshly prepared dichloromethane solution
of triflic azide was then added, and the solution was brought to homogeneity
by adding methanol (4 mL). The resulting solution was stirred at room
temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then poured into saturated
aqueous sodium bicarbonate (30 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane
(3 × 20 mL). The collective organic phases were washed with brine
(30 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated.
The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (0.49
g, 90%).16,17

3.2.3 Procedure for the Synthesis
of Penicillin–Triazole
Conjugates by Planetary Ball Milling
Carboxyl-protected 6-azido
penicillate (1 mmol) and alkynes 5a–s (1.1 mmol) were taken in a stainless steel (SS) jar (50 mL capacity)
containing 10 SS balls (10 mmol), and sodium ascorbate (0.4 mmol)
was further added to it followed by the addition of copper sulfate
(0.2 mol mmol). The resulting mixture was subsequently ground in a
planetary ball mill (Retsch PM-100, Retsch GmbH, Germany) at 300 rpm.
After completion of the reaction, the mixture was dissolved in ethyl
acetate (EA) and isolated by column chromatography (EA/hexane) to
furnish analytically pure product.18

3.2.4 Procedure for the Deprotection of Benzyl
Ester
Benzyl-protected 6-triazolylpenicillanic derivatives
(6a–j, 5 mmol) were dissolved in
a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and methanol. Pd/C (0.25 g) was added,
and the solution was stirred under hydrogen atmosphere (reaction time,
3 h; hydrogen pressure, 5 bar) at room temperature. The reaction mixture
was filtered and evaporated in vacuum to furnish the desired product.19

3.2.5 Biological Screening
3.2.5.1 Antimicrobial Assay
All of the
synthesized PNTCs were inspected for antimicrobial activity against
two Gram-positive bacterial strains, two Gram-negative bacterial strains,
and three fungal strains using agar dilution method.20 The strains procured from Institute of Microbial Technology,
Chandigarh, are as follows: E.coli (MTCC
443), P. aeruginosa (MTCC 1688), S. aureus (MTCC 96), S. pyogenus (MTCC 442), C. albicans (MTCC 227), A. niger (MTCC 282), and A. clavatus (MTCC 1323). Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin
were used as standard control drugs for antibacterial activity, whereas
griseofulvin and nystatin were used as standard control drugs for
antifungal activity. The results are reported in Table 1 in the form of minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentation (MFC).

3.2.5.2 Ex Vivo Cytotoxicity
Hemolytic
Assay Erythrocyte suspension was prepared by centrifuging 10 mL of
whole human blood with isotonic buffer for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The
supernatant was separated, and packed cells were suspended with equal
volume of normal saline and re-centrifuged. The process was repeated
until a clear supernatant was obtained. From the resultant, 10% erythrocyte
suspension was prepared. To 2 mL of saline solution, 1 mL of PBS and
1 mL sample solution (7a−j, amphicillin,
Nystatin) and 0.5 mL were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30
min. After incubation the reaction vessel was allowed to cool, and
absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 560 nm. Percentage
hemolysis and HD50 of the compound under study were calculated.21

3.2.6 Toxicological
Evaluation
3.2.6.1 Animals Used
For acute toxicological
analysis as well as determination of LD50, female, while
for subacute toxicological, either sex Wistar albino rats were used.
All the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC). The experimental animals were housed
at constant temperature (21 ± 2 °C) and RH 55 ± 5%
with 12 h alternate light and dark cycles and free access to food
and water. The protocol used in context of the study was pre-approved
by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (Reg No: 379/CPCSEA/IAEC-2018/030).

3.2.6.2 Single-Dose Acute Toxicity Studies
Acute toxicity studies of the 7c, 7d, 7e, 7g, and 7i were formed as per
OECD TG 420. Animals were dosed in stepwise method using set dose
levels of 5, 50, 200, 300, and 2000 mg/Kg bw. A total of five animals
per dose level were used. Former to dosing, the animals were subjected
to overnight fasting. The test substances were administered orally.
Sighting studies were performed to find the starting dose of the study.
Based on the absence and presence of signs of toxicity or mortality,
further dose levels were evaluated. A period of 24 h was allowed between
administrations of each subsequent dose level. All the animals were
observed for 14 days.22

3.2.6.3 Determination of LD50
To determine the LD50 of the synthesized conjugates, OECD
test guideline 425 (up and down procedure) was followed with slight
modification. As per the described study design, animals were segregated
into control and treatment groups and fasted overnight prior to the
study. The test compounds were orally administered in a single ordered
test progression (175, 550, 1000, and 2000 mg/Kg), one at a time at
48 h intervals. Subsequent animals were administered a lower or higher
dose on the basis of appearance of either morbidity or mortality.
Dosing was discontinued if three consecutive animals survived at the
upper bound dose. Following this, an estimate of LD50 was
calculated using the maximum likelihood method (Table 2).23

3.2.6.4 Subacute Toxicity Studies
Subacute
toxicity studies were performed using the 28-days repeated dose protocol
prescribed by OECD TG 407 with a slight modification. Compounds 7c, 7d, 7e, 7g, and 7i were daily administered orally at a dose of 300 mg/kg bw
and 500 mg/kg bw for a period of 28 days. The animals were routinely
checked for signs for morbidity and mortality. From the data obtained,
no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was reported.24−26

3.2.7 Statistical Analysis
The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities were performed
in triplicate. The results of in vivo acute, median
lethal dose and subacute studies were presented as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). Variation in mean values was analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett’s analysis
by means of GraphPad Insat 3 software.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized a series of PNTCs
which are bioisostere
of penicillin V, ciclacillin, and some relatively close bioisostere
of the penicillin family. Compounds 7b, 7d, 7e, 7g, and 7i showed highest
antibacterial activity, whereas 7b showed excellent antifungal
activity. Further, 7a, 7b, and 7f proved good candidates as antifungal agents. The studies revealed
that some of the compounds exhibited activities more than that of
reference drugs. Compounds containing substituted benzene and cyclic
ring displayed superior activity to the standard, thereby showing
the role of 1,2,3-triazole moiety on the antimicrobial potential of
the target compounds. Compound 7g was found to be the
most vigorous against P. aeruginosa, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus with MIC values of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 μM/mL,
respectively. Thus, from the studies, it could be accomplished that
conjoining triazole moiety with the β-lactam pharmacophore would
yield compounds successful in addressing the issue of drug resistance
along with enhanced antibacterial potency and reduced toxicity.
