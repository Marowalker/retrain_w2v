Carbon
monoxide (CO) has long been recognized as a metabolic waste
and toxic gas and is also the most common asphyxiating poison that
seriously endangers human health. Thus, an adsorption material with
high CO adsorption capability is urgently needed. In this study, carbon
xerogels (CXs) doped with CuCl were prepared via a sol–gel
method and a facile soaking process. The CuCl-doped CXs show the highest
CO adsorption capacity of 12.04 cc/g, which is much higher than those
of the undoped CXs and activated carbon. Such a high adsorption capacity
of the CuCl-doped CXs is not only because of their high porosity but
also because of the chemical adsorption induced by CuCl. Moreover,
these CuCl-doped CXs exhibit high desorption rate (∼79%), which
is beneficial for repeatability.

1 Introduction
Carbon monoxide (CO) is
a widely distributed pollutant in the atmosphere,
which is easily produced due to the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous
substances in coal stoves, gas water heaters, automobile engine, and
cigarettes.1−4 In many cases, CO is generally not easy to draw people’s
attention because of its colorless and odorless properties and causes
many hazards.5,6 The acute CO poisoning is one
of the most common causes of death due to accidental poisoning. It
is reported that at least 15 200 individuals need to seek medical
advice for CO poisoning every year in the United States.7 Therefore, scientists have started to study innovative
materials that could adsorb CO. However, widely studied CO adsorption
materials8−11 show unsatisfactory adsorption performance. These CO adsorbents
like activated carbon (AC),12−14 zeolites,15 molecular sieves,16,17 metal oxides,18 and metal–organic frameworks19 still need to be improved. Among them, a Y-type
molecular sieve needs to be heated at a certain temperature for the
effective adsorption of CO. Moreover, molecular sieves are particularly
susceptible to moisture and can only be used for temperature swing
adsorption due to the high energy consumption and complicated operating
steps. This is disadvantageous to the realization of pressure swing
adsorption. The activated alumina calcined by aluminum hydroxide shows
the unique properties such as high specific surface area (SSA), abundant
pores, high thermal stability, and strong acid resistance, but its
dispersion and adsorption capacity are relatively poor. Activated
carbon, as a kind of porous material, has shown great application
in gas adsorption due to the high specific surface area; however,
the surface nature of activated carbon is easily affected by the hydrophobic
and lipophilic properties of the surface and it is chemically unstable.
Therefore, exploring an absorbent with high specific surface area
and stable structural properties to enhance the ability to absorb
CO is worthy and meaningful. To date, the methods for enhancing the
adsorption performance of adsorbents can be divided into two categories:
regulating the pore size and pore volume of the adsorbent and doping
some metals (such as Cu, Ag, Pt, Fe, Pd, etc.) to introduce some active
sites onto the surface of the adsorbent for the adsorption of CO.

Carbon aerogels, as a type of nanocarbon material first synthesized
in 1989 by Pekala,20 have many unique advantages
including high porosity, high specific surface area, strong structural
controllability, and a wide range of density variation.21−24 Based on these advantages, the carbon aerogels can be used as a
good absorbent to absorb CO gas. However, the adsorption of CO with
carbon aerogels is a physical process. Physical adsorption is a weak
adsorption process carried out by van der Waals force. The adsorption
speed is fast, and the adsorption equilibrium can be reached instantaneously.
Unfortunately, the adsorption capacity of physical adsorption is limited
and relatively low, which cannot meet the demands for the absorption
of CO in the practical application. Chemical adsorption is a strong
adsorption process in which a chemical reaction occurs between the
adsorbent and the adsorbate because of the action of the chemical
bonding. The adsorption capacity of chemical adsorption is much higher
than that of physical adsorption. Therefore, the introduction of chemical
adsorption in adsorbents can further enhance the CO adsorption performance
of the adsorbent materials. Transition metal ions including Cu+, Ag+, and Ni+ can react with CO to
generate the complexes; this reaction is a chemical adsorption process
and more stable than physical adsorption. According to the reported
research results, Cu+ has a better adsorption performance
than Ag+ and Ni+. Therefore, the introduction
of Cu+ into the carbon aerogels is expected to enhance
the adsorption performance.25,26

In this work,
we used resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) as raw
materials and sodium carbonate anhydrous as a catalyst to prepare
the CuCl-doped carbon xerogels (CXs) by a sol–gel method and
a facile soaking process. When used to adsorb CO, the CXs doped with
CuCl show a better adsorption performance than undoped CXs and active
carbon. Appropriate doping contents of CuCl can achieve the highest
CO adsorption capacity. The enhanced adsorption performance of CXs
doped with CuCl can be attributed to the high specific surface area
and introduced CuCl that generates complex adsorption.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Resorcinol
(≥99.5%,
AR), formaldehyde aqueous solution (37–40%, AR), sodium carbonate
anhydrous (≥99.8%, AR), alcohol (≥99.7%, AR), hydrochloric
acid (36–38%, AR), and cuprous chloride (≥97%, AR) were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

2.2 Preparation of CuCl-Doped Carbon Xerogels
(CXs)
The synthetic pathway of CuCl-doped CXs
mainly involved six components: resorcinol (R), formaldehyde (F) aqueous
solution, sodium carbonate anhydrous, alcohol, hydrochloric acid,
and cuprous chloride. The molar ratio of R and F is set to 1:2. The
fabrication process is divided into two steps, as shown in Figure 1. Step 1 involves
the synthesis of CXs monoliths. A certain amount of R was dissolved
into the deionized water to make R aqueous solution. The F aqueous
solution and sodium carbonate were then added to R aqueous solution
successively with stirring for 2 h. After stirring, wet resorcinol–formaldehyde
(RF) gels were obtained. The wet RF gels were aged in an oven at 30
°C for 1 day, 50 °C for 1 day, and 90 °C for 3 days,
respectively. The aged RF gels were then washed in alcohol solution
for a week at room temperature. After washing, the gels were stored
in a beaker and dried at 50 °C for a week under atmospheric pressure.
Finally, the CXs were obtained by carbonization of RF xerogels at
1000 °C for 4 h under the protection of a N2 atmosphere.
Step 2 involves the synthesis of CuCl-doped CXs monoliths. First,
certain amounts of CuCl and HCl were mixed with water to obtain CuCl–HCl
solution. Second, the CXs were immersed in CuCl–HCl solution
and the solution was kept in an oven at 50 °C for 12 h to evaporate
the solvent; this process needs to be repeated three times. At length,
the CuCl-doped CXs were acquired after heating at 50 °C for 48
h under ambient pressure drying.

CXs.

To simply distinguish CuCl-doped
CXs prepared with various contents
of CuCl, all samples were denoted “CX–CuCl-x”, where CX is the abbreviation of CXs and x represents the mass ratio of CuCl and CX.

2.3 Characterization
The morphology of
the samples was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
Philips-XL30FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2-100F).

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the
samples were measured at 77 K by a N2 adsorption–desorption
analyzer (TriStar 3000). The specific surface areas (SSAs) were calculated
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The mesopore and
micropore size distributions were deduced using a nonlocal density
functional theory (NLDFT) method. The compositions of the samples
were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE), energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Philips-XL30FEG), mapping (Philips-XL30FEG),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, EscaLab 250Xi). The CO
adsorption–desorption capacities of active carbon, CXs, and
CuCl-doped CXs were evaluated by a gas sorption analyzer (ASAP2460).
The FTIR spectra of doped and undoped CXs before and after CO adsorption
and desorption were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
(FTIR, TENSOR 27).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Macroscopic and Microscopic Structure of CXs
and CuCl-Doped CXs
The macrostructure of samples CX and CX–CuCl-2.5
was shown in Figure 2. The ambient pressure-dried CX shows a black and unbroken monolith
shape. After doping, the CX still retains a good integrity, as displayed
in Figure 2b, which
indicates that the macrostructures of sample CXs show no obvious changes
after the soaking process.

Figure 2 Digital camera images of (a) CX and (b) CX–CuCl-2.5.

The microstructures of CXs and
CuCl-doped CXs were characterized
by SEM and TEM, as shown in Figure 3. It is obviously observed from Figure 3a–c that CXs and CuCl-doped CXs are
composed of carbon nanoparticle interconnected aggregates. Compared
to the sample CX, both CX–CuCl-1 and CX–CuCl-2.5 have
less pores and a more continuous network structure, which is ascribed
to the interference of CuCl in the soaking process. The preservation
of the unique microstructure for samples CA–CuCl-1 and CA–CuCl-2.5
will facilitate the adsorption of CO. The combination between CAs
and CuCl does not affect the microstructure of CuCl-doped carbon aerogels.

Figure 3 SEM and
corresponding TEM images of (a, d) CX, (b, e) CX–CuCl-1,
and (c, f) CX–CuCl-2.5.

As displayed in TEM images (Figure 3d–f), the doped and undoped CXs display
a three-dimensional
network structure. The solid phase is composed of interconnected carbon
nanoparticles with particle size ranging from 15 to 30 nm. After doping
with CuCl, the CXs still retain a continuous and homogeneous network
structure. The above analysis demonstrates that samples CX, CX–CuCl-1,
and CX–CuCl-2.5 possess a porous, cross-linked, and uniform
network structure, which is beneficial for CO adsorption.

3.2 Pore Structure of CXs and CuCl-Doped CXs
Figure 4 shows the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding
pore size distribution of samples CX, CX–CuCl-1, and CX–CuCl-2.5.
As shown in Figure 4a–c, all of the isotherms of the doped and undoped CXs exhibit
a type IV isotherm with an H3-type hysteresis loop, which illustrates
the characteristics of mesoporous materials, whereas these prepared
samples possess micropores under low pressure.27 The detailed pore structure parameters are presented in Table 1. After the doping
of CuCl, the specific surface areas of CX–CuCl-1 and CX–CuCl-2.5
decrease from 441 to 108 and 97 m2/g, respectively. As
shown in Figure 4d–f,
the mesopore (2–50 nm) and micropore (<2 nm) size distributions
of samples were calculated using the NLDFT method. In the range of
mesopores, the curves of samples CX, CX–CuCl-1, and CX–CuCl-2.5
show no significant difference, which indicates that the undoped and
doped CXs have a similar mesoporous structure. However, the CX has
a higher micropore size distribution peak compared to those of doped
CXs. These results illustrate that CuCl-doped CXs possess less micropores,
which is ascribed to the filling of partial mesopores of CXs in the
soaking process. Moreover, the CXs doped with CuCl (CX–CuCl-1
and CX–CuCl-2.5) have a much smaller microporous specific surface
area (28 and 13 m2/g, respectively), which confirms to
the result of pore size distribution. As presented in Table 1, the bulk density of the doped
CXs is larger compared to that of undoped CXs and the bulk density
of CuCl-doped CXs rises with the increasing content of CuCl. Although
the increase of the content of CuCl is helpful for CO adsorption,
the number of micropores decreases and the microstructure of samples
gets denser compared to that of pure CXs, which can also be confirmed
by the SEM and TEM images in Figure 3. Thus, the introduction of only appropriate contents
of CuCl into the CXs can give better CO adsorption capacity to the
doped CXs. The combination between the high porosity of CX and strong
CO adsorption capacity of CuCl is extremely essential and valuable.

3.3 Composition
Characterization of CuCl-Doped
CXs
The EDS results of CX–CuCl-1 and CX–CuCl-2.5
are presented in Figure 5a,b. It is obviously observed that the C, Cu, and Cl elements play
a dominant role in samples CX–CuCl-1 and CX–CuCl-2.5
and no other elements appear. The weight percent (wt %) of the Cu
and Cl elements increase from 9.63 and 13.89 to 13.52 and 17.13, respectively,
which is in accordance with the change of the bulk density of doped
CXs, as shown in Table 1. To further characterize the dispersion of CuCl in CXs, the EDS
mapping of CX–CuCl-2.5 was performed, as shown in Figure 5c. The elements of
Cu and Cl almost completely cover the C element, revealing that the
CuCl components are homogeneously wrapped on the surface of CXs. Moreover,
the mapping trajectories of sample CX–CuCl-2.5 are consistent
with those of Cu and Cl elements, which also indicate that the CuCl
was uniformly dispersed in CXs.

(b) CX–CuCl-2.5.
(c) Mapping analysis of CX–CuCl-2.5.

The crystal structures of CX, CX–CuCl-1, and CA–CuCl-2.5
were further characterized by XRD. According to the XRD results, the
pure CX exhibits two distinct peaks at 2θ = 24 and 44°,
corresponding to the {002} and {101} planes (Figure 6a). These two typical peaks demonstrate that
the CX is an amorphous and short-range ordered carbon material. The
interlayer spacing calculated from the 2θ value (24°) at
the peak position of CX was d002 = 0.368
nm, which is larger than that of the graphite (d002 = 0.335 nm), revealing that there is a graphitized microcrystalline
structure in CX.28 After doping with CuCl,
new peaks at 30.9, 33, 50.5, and 57° appear, which correspond
to the diffraction peaks of CuCl.29,30 In addition,
these peaks strengthen with the increase of the content of CuCl.

Figure 6 (a) XRD
patterns of pure CX, CX–CuCl-1, and CX–CuCl-2.5.
(b) Deconvoluted Cu 2p XPS spectra of CX–CuCl-2.5.

To further confirm the existence of Cu+, the Cu 2p XPS
spectra of CX–CuCl-2.5 were characterized and are shown in Figure 6b. It is clearly
seen that there are two types of copper ions (Cu+ and Cu2+) in the sample CX–CuCl-2.5. The peaks at 932.60 and
952.45 eV correspond to Cu+ species, whereas the bands
at 934.75 and 954.65 eV are associated with Cu2+ species.31 The area ratios of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 XPS spectra
are 1.14 and 0.96, respectively. The existence of Cu+ species
in CuCl-doped CXs makes the CuCl-doped samples to have excellent characteristic
of CO adsorption.

3.4 CO Adsorption–Desorption
Performance
of CuCl-Doped CXs
Before the CO adsorption and desorption
measurement, the samples were degassed at 200 °C. The adsorption–desorption
isotherms represent the relationship between adsorption–desorption
capacity and the relative pressure. The CO adsorption–desorption
isotherms of CuCl-doped CXs, CX, and activated carbon (AC) are shown
in Figure 6. As presented
in Figure 7a, the CO
adsorption capacity of CuCl-doped CXs first increases and then reduces
with the increasing content of CuCl. This is due to that the excess
CuCl fills the pores of CX, which causes the reduction of specific
surface area of doped CXs (see Table 1). It makes the physical adsorption capacity to drop
considerably. Therefore, a desirable combination between CO physical
adsorption and chemical adsorption induced by CuCl can only be obtained
in an appropriate CuCl doping. The optimal sample (CX–CuCl-2.5)
can reach a highest CO adsorption capacity of 12.04 cc/g, which is
about 150 and 280% that of the pure CXs (8.19 cc/g) and AC (4.27 cc/g),
respectively.

Figure 7 (a) CO adsorption and (b) desorption isotherms of CX–CuCl-0.5,
CX–CuCl-1, CX–CuCl-2.5, CX–CuCl-3.5, CX, and
AC.

As shown in Figure 7b, from the desorption isotherms of samples,
we can clearly see that
although the desorption rate of the CuCl-doped CXs (∼79%) is
not as high as that of CX (∼88%) and AC (∼90%), it is
enough to meet the repeatability that is required in the practical
application. In general, the desorption rate of CuCl-doped CXs decreases
with the increase of the CuCl content due to more complexes formed
by the reaction between Cu+ and CO. However, the CuCl-doped
CXs still retain a high desorption rate because of the small addition
of CuCl. The CO gas adsorption reported in the literature and industry
focuses on the interaction of CO molecules and Cu+. Here,
Cu–C bonds are formed after the interaction of the CuCl-doped
CXs and CO molecules.32 The introduction
of Cu+ into CX can improve the CO adsorption capacity considerably
and hardly affect the desorption capacity of samples. The high CO
adsorption capacity of CuCl-doped CXs benefits from the combination
of physical and chemical adsorption, whereas CXs and AC can only depend
on physical adsorption.

FTIR spectra of samples CX and CX–CuCl-2.5
before and after
adsorption of CO are shown in Figure 8. It can be observed that the spectra of CX and CX–CuCl-2.5
are very similar, revealing that they feature a similar chemical structure
that is formed after the adsorption of CO. The broad peak at 3440
cm–1 is ascribed to the stretching vibration of
hydroxyl (−OH). The existence of −OH may be due to the
adsorbed water on the surface of samples. The absorption peaks at
around 2903 and 2962 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching
vibrations of −CH2 and −CH3, respectively,
whereas the band at around 1369 cm–1 is attributed
to the scissor vibration of −CH2 and flexural vibration
of −CH3. The band at 1620 cm–1 is due to the stretching vibration of aromatic rings. The absorption
peak of methylene-ether (CH2–O–CH2) is observed at 1094 cm–1. The cross-linked CH2–O–CH2 bond is formed between aromatic
rings because of polycondensation.33 These
results illustrate that the chemical groups of CX and CX–CuCl-2.5
before the adsorption of CO are consistent with those after the adsorption
of CO, indicating the stability of the CXs.

and CX–CuCl-2.5 before and after
adsorption of CO.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we prepared the CXs doped with different amounts of
CuCl by a sol–gel method combined with a facile soaking process.
The pore structure and morphology characterization reveals that the
introduction of CuCl does not destroy the network structure of the
CXs, and there is no obvious clustering of CuCl in the framework of
CXs. CO adsorption performance of CXs doped with different amounts
of CuCl was measured. The sample CX–CuCl-2.5 shows the highest
CO adsorption capacity of 12.04 cc/g, which is about 150 and 280%
that of the pure CXs (8.19 cc/g) and activated carbon (4.27 cc/g),
respectively. These results demonstrate that the CO adsorption of
CuCl-doped CXs is the dual effect of physical adsorption and chemical
adsorption. In addition, these CuCl-doped CXs exhibit high desorption
rate (∼79%), which will make them a good candidate for the
effective solution of “CO pollution” in this field.
