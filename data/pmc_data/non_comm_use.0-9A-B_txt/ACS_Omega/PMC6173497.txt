Demand for label-free electrochemical
immunosensor has resulted
in extensive research in improving the conductivity of a sensing interface
and antibody immobilization. In this paper, an electrochemical immunosensor
for prostate specific antigen based on dialdehyde-functionalized ionic
liquid used as a novel linking reagent to replace glutaraldehyde for
the antibody immobilization is described. The novel linking reagent
enhanced the conductivity of the sensing interface. Thus, the proposed
immunosensor had a wider linear range of 0.05–30 ng mL–1, with a lower detection limit of 0.04 ng mL–1 compared with the immunosensor based on glutaraldehyde for the antibody
immobilization.

1 Introduction
Up
to now, many electrochemical immunosensors have been developed
because they possess some attractive properties such as sensitivity,
ease of use, and simplicity.1,2 Antibody is usually
used as a capture element in immunosensors, and therefore the antibody
immobilization is very important. One of the most common methods of
antibody immobilization favors premodifying of electrode with some
materials containing carboxylic acid or amine groups, followed by
cross-linking of antibody to the modifying material.3−6 For example, Chit is usually used as a matrix to modify electrode
due to its excellent film-forming ability and abundant reactive amino
groups and then glutaraldehyde (GA) is used as a linking agent for
antibody immobilization.7−10 But after glutaraldehyde was introduced, the electrical
conductivity of the electrode surface decreased. Therefore, seeking
a novel cross-linking agent to immobilize antibody and simultaneously
improve the conductivity of a sensing interface is of great significance
for the immunosensors based on Chit and other modifying materials
with amino groups.

Ionic liquids (ILs) have been used as the
modifier11 or the supporting electrolyte12 in the electroanalysis field because of their
high ionic conductivity
and biocompatibility. ILs were also incorporated into conventional
matrixes, including biopolymers, cellulose, metal nanoparticles, and
sol–gel-based silica matrices to form stable composite materials
for the fabrication immunosensor.13−16 Due to the high ionic conductivity
and biocompatibility, ILs-containing modifying films provided a good
microenvironment to entrap proteins and enhanced the conductivity
of the electrode surface.17,18 In our previous work,19 we developed an electrochemical immunosensor
based on ionic liquid functionalized with aldehyde. But a molecule
of aldehyde-functionalized ionic liquid (DIL) contains only one aldehyde
group that is used to capture antibody. It was modified on the electrode
surface through noncovalent interaction, which is not favorable for
the stability of the immunosensor due to the leakage of IL. Thus,
this work focused on the use of dialdehyde-functionalized ionic liquid
(DIL) as a linking agent to the fabricated immunosensor. The one aldehyde
group was used to covalently interact with the amino group of Chit,
which introduced DIL onto the electrode surface. This covalent interaction
prevented the leakage of DIL from the electrode surface to electrolyte
solution. The other aldehyde group was used to capture antibody. To
the best of our knowledge, few electrochemical immunosensors based
on DIL were reported.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a marker
related to prostate
cancer or other prostate disorders. The determination of PSA is of
great significance in clinical diagnosis and postcure monitoring.
In this work, DIL was successfully synthesized. It was introduced
on the electrode surface through covalent interaction between aldehyde
group of DIL and the amino group of Chit that was modified on the
electrode surface in advance. Herein, DIL not only likes a linking
agent to immobilize antibody but also can improve the conductivity
of the sensing interface. Thus, the immunosensor based on DIL is simple,
sensitive, and stable. We hope this strategy would provide a new platform
for the detection of PSA and other cancer markers.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Reagents and Apparatus
PSA antigen
(PSA), anti-PSA antibody (Ab), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were
provided by Beijing Dingguo Biotechnology Company (Beijing, China).
4,4′-Bipyridine and 4-(bromomethyl)benzaldehyde were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.0)
was obtained with Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4. Chit solution (1%) was prepared by fully dissolving
chitosan in acetic acid solution by sonication. Electrochemical experiments
were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemistry workstation (Shanghai
CH Instruments, China) with a standard three-electrode.

2.2 Preparation of Dialdehyde Ionic Liquid (DIL)
4,4′-Bipyridine
(0.156 g, 1 mmol) and 4-(bromomethyl)benzaldehyde
(0.498 g, 2.5 mmol) were added to acetonitrile (20 mL) and refluxed
overnight. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then the
precipitate was filtered to afford a yellow solid of 0.42 g (76%).
The synthesis route for dialdehyde-functionalized ionic liquid is
shown in Figure 1A.

route for dialdehyde-functionalized ionic liquid.

2.3 Fabrication
of the Immunosensor
Prior
to preparing the immunosensor, the gold electrode was polished repeatedly
with 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina slurries and washed with doubly
distilled water. The cleaned electrode was modified with Chit by drop-coating
10 μL of 1% Chit solution directly onto the electrode surface
and dried in the air. Then, 10 μL of 3 mg mL–1 DIL aqueous solution was dropped on the Chit film, resulting in
the formation of Chit/DIL film. One hour later, this was washed with
doubly distilled water and dried in the air. Then, the Chit/DIL film-modified
electrode was incubated with 10 μL of 50 μg mL–1 antibody solution for 40 min at 37 °C and washed carefully
with PBS. Then, the Chit/DIL/Ab-modified electrode was incubated with
10 μL of BSA (2.0 wt %) for 30 min at 37 °C to block nonspecific
active sites and washed with PBS. Finally, the electrode blocked with
BSA was incubated with 10 μL of antigen solution with different
concentration for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by washing with PBS
and then measuring the electrochemical signals. The schematic illustration
of the immunosensor is shown in Figure 1B.

2.4 Electrochemical Measurements
The
used three-electrode system includes a Pt electrode (counter electrode),
a saturated calomel electrode (reference electrode), and a gold electrode
(Au) (working electrode). After BSA-blocked electrodes were incubated
with 10 μL of PSA solution with different concentrations, the
electrodes were dipped in a 5 mM Fe(CN)63–/4– solution and measured with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).
The peak current of DPV decreases with the increase of the PSA concentration.
Thus, the quantitative detection of PSA can be achievable. DPV measurements
were carried under the following conditions: the potential range is
from 0.2 to 0.8 V, pulse amplitude is 0.05 V, pulse width is 0.05
s, sample width is 0.02 s, and scan rate is 100 mV s–1.

in Figures S1 and S2 (see the Supporting
Information).

3.2 Electrochemical Characterization
of the Modified
Electrode
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) was a convenient method
for probing the feature of the modified electrode surface. In this
work, CV measurements were performed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) containing
5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 from −0.2
to 0.6 V. Figure 2A
showed the cyclic voltammograms of bare electrode, Chit-modified electrode,
Chit/DIL-modified electrode, Chit/DIL/Ab-modified electrode, Chit/DIL/Ab/BSA-modified
electrode, and Chit/DIL/Ab/BSA/PSA-modified electrode. A couple of
well-defined redox peaks could be observed at bare Au electrode (Figure 2A,a). The peak current
of Chit-modified electrode decreased (Figure 2A,b), whereas for the DIL modified on the
Chit film, the peak current at the Chit/DIL-modified electrode increased
(Figure 2A,c) obviously
as compared with that at the Chit-modified electrode and even bare
electrode. The enhancement can be ascribed to the high conductivity
of DIL. After the Chit/DIL-modified electrode was incubated with Ab
solution, the current response decreased (Figure 2A,d), demonstrating that antibody was immobilized
on the electrode. When BSA was used to block the nonspecific active
sites, a further decrease of the peak current of CV was observed (Figure 2A,e). After Chit/DIL/Ab/BSA-modified
electrode was incubated with antigen solution, a decrease in peak
current was obtained (Figure 2A,f). This is because the formed antibody–antigen immunocomplex
on the electrode surface hindered the electron transfer.

Figure 2 CV (A) and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (B) profiles
of the stepwise preparation of the immunosensor: (a) Au bare electrode,
(b) Chit/Au, (c) DIL/Chit/Au, (d) Ab/DIL/Chit/Au, (e) BSA/Ab/DIL/Chit/Au,
and (f) PSA/BSA/Ab/DIL/Chit/Au. The concentration of PSA is 10 ng
mL–1.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used
to monitor
the changes of interfacial properties at electrode surfaces. The EIS
curves resulted from 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] are presented
in Figure 2B. The semicircle
diameter is equal to the electron-transfer resistance (Ret). Curve a represents the Ret of the bare electrode (Figure 2B,a). When the bare electrode was modified with Chit,
the Ret increased (Figure 2B,b). However, when DIL/CHO was modified
on the Au/Chit electrode, Ret decreased
(Figure 2B,c), which
proved that DIL/CHO improved the conductivity of electrode surface.
After the electrode was modified stepwise with anti-PSA antibody (Figure 2B,d), BSA (Figure 2B,e), and PSA (Figure 2B,f), the Ret was gradually increased. The reason is that
the protein layer obstructed the interfacial electron transfer, leading
to an increase in Ret.

The effect
of the scan rate on performance of the proposed immunosensor
was also investigated. Figure 3 showed that the peak current increased with the increase
of the scan rate at the range of 40–200 mV s–1. Moreover, a linear relationship between the peak current and the
square root of the scan rate was observed (Figure 3, Inset). These results demonstrated that
the redox reaction was controlled by a diffusion process.20,21

3.3 Comparison
of Glutaraldehyde with Dialdehyde-Functionalized
Ionic Liquid As a Linking Agent
In the fabrication of electrochemical
immunosensors, Chit was usually used as a coating material to functionalize
the electrode surface, followed by cross-linking of antibody to it
by using glutaraldehyde as a linking agent. Here, dialdehyde-functionalized
ionic liquid replaced glutaraldehyde as a linking agent for attaching
antibody to the Chit film. Under the same concentration of 0.3% (w/w),
the comparison of glutaraldehyde with dialdehyde-functionalized ionic
liquid as a linking agent was carried out. As shown in Figure 4, curve a represented the CV
of Chit-modified electrode. When dialdehyde-functionalized ionic liquid
was modified on the Chit film, the peak current of CV increased (Figure 4 curve b), indicating
that the introduction of DIL improved the conductivity of the sensing
interface. When glutaraldehyde was modified on the Chit film, the
peak current of CV decreased (Figure 4 curve c), indicating that the use of glutaraldehyde
obstructed the electronic transfer of the sensing interface.

3.4 Optimization
of the Experimental Conditions
The reaction time of Chit
with DIL was discussed at room temperature. Figure 5A shows the peak
current of DPV of the immunosensor decreasing as reaction time increases
until a platform appeared at 40 min. Thus, the choice of reaction
time was 40 min.

Figure 5 (A) Effect of reaction time between DIL and Chit on the
peak current
of the immunosensor. (B) Effect of the concentration of DIL on the
peak current of the immunosensor. (C) Effect of the concentration
of antibody on the peak current of the immunosensor. The concentration
of PSA is 10 ng mL –1.

The influence of the concentration of DIL on the response
of the
immunosensor was investigated. Figure 5B shows when the concentration of DIL increased from
0.1 to 0.3% (w/w), the peak current of DPV decreased. When the concentration
of DIL was higher than 0.3%, the peak current of DPV was almost a
constant value. As a result, 0.3% of DIL was selected.

The influence
of the antibody concentration on the response of
the immunosensor was investigated from 25 to 100 μg mL–1 at room temperature. These antibodies of different concentrations
reacted with the same PSA target concentration of 10 ng mL–1. Figure 5C shows
that the antibody concentration of 50 μg mL–1 was an optimal selection.

3.5 Detection of PSA
After different
concentrations of PSA were modified on the electrode, the DPV curves
were recorded. The linear relationship of the proposed immunosensor
between the peak current and the concentration of PSA was obtained
in the range of 0.05–30 ng mL–1 (shown as
the inset of Figure 6A), with a detection limit of 0.04 ng mL–1. The
equation was I (μA) = 49.5–1.16 c (ng
mL–1) (R = 0.9972). However, the
linear range of the immunosensor based on glutaraldehyde (GA) as a
linking reagent was 0.1–25 ng mL–1 (shown
as the inset of Figure 6B), with a detection limit of 0.08 ng mL–1. The
equation was I (μA) = 29.7–0.62 c (ng
mL–1) (R = 0.9932).

Figure 6 (A) DPV responses of
the DIL-based immunosensor to different concentrations
of PSA (inset: calibration curve of the DIL-based immunosensor to
different concentrations of PSA). From (a) to (g): 0.05, 1, 5, 10,
15, 20, and 30 ng mL–1. (B) DPV responses of the
GA-based immunosensor to different concentrations of PSA (inset: calibration

PSA). From (a) to (g): 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 ng mL–1. Error bars represent the standard deviation, n = 3.

The detection limit was calculated
based on 3σ (where σ
is the standard deviation of a blank solution). These results demonstrated
that the immunosensor based on DIL had a wider linear range and lower
detection limit than that of the immunosensor-based GA. The proposed
immunosensor was compared with other PSA immunosensors. As shown in Table 1, the immunosensor
fabricated by us is compared with other immunosensors.

3.6 Reproducibility, Specificity,
and Stability
of the Immunosensor
Using inter-and intra-assay (n = 5) at 10 ng mL–1 PSA, we investigated
the reproducibility of the proposed immunosensor. As a result, the
coefficients of variation of inter-and intra-assay were 8.3 and 6.8%,
respectively, suggesting the developed immunosensor possessed good
reproducibility.

To evaluate the specificity of the proposed
immunosensor, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), human IgG, and α-fetoprotein
(AFP) were used as potential interfering materials instead of PSA,
followed by measuring the DPV. Figure 7 showed that the peak current of DPV toward a higher
concentration (100 ng mL–1) of interfering substances
was close to the response toward blank solution. The peak current
of DPV toward PSA (10 ng mL–1) was much lower than
that of interfering substances. However, the signal of the mixture
materials of CEA, IgG, AFP, and PSA is close to the response toward
PSA alone. These results indicated that the specificity of the fabricated
immunosensor was acceptable.

Figure 7 Specificity of the immunosensor. The concentration
of nonspecific
materials is 100 ng mL–1, and the concentration
of PSA is 10 ng mL–1; error bars represent standard
deviation, n = 3.

To estimate the stability of the immunosensor, the initial
DPV
was measured. The modified electrode was stored at 4 °C when
it was not in use. After 7 days, the DPV current response was measured
as decreased by 4.5%. After 21 days, the DPV current response decreased
by 9.6%. The results demonstrated the designed immunosensor has satisfactory
stability.

3.7 Real Sample Analysis
To further investigate
the practical application of the proposed immunosensor in a clinical
assay, we analyzed four undiluted human serum samples obtained from
real patients. The assay results were compared with those resulted
from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and are represented
in Table 2. By comparing
experimental results, we can see no significant differences of two
methods, indicating a good correlation between ELISA and this proposed
method. The proposed immunosensor was reliable for PSA detection.

4 Conclusions
Here, dialdehyde-functionalized ionic liquid
was prepared and replaced
glutaraldehyde as a novel linking regent for the fabrication of label-free
electrochemical immunosensors toward PSA. The use of dialdehyde-functionalized
ionic liquid can improve the conductivity of the sensing interface.
The developed immunosensor exhibited good reproducibility, specificity,
and stability, which provided a promising potential for accurate clinic
immunoassays of PSA as well as other tumor markers.
