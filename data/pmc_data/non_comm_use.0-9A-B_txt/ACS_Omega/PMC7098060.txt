Molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2) is a promising layer-structured
material for use in many applications due to its tunable structural
and electronic properties in terms of its structural phases. Its performance
including efficiency and durability is often dependent on its mechanical
properties. To understand the effects of the structural phase on its
mechanical properties, a comparative study on the mechanical properties
of bulk 2H, 3R, 1T, and 1T′ MoS2 was conducted using
the first-principles density functional theory. Since considerable
applications of MoS2 are developed through strain engineering,
the impact of the external pressure on its mechanical properties was
also considered. Our results suggest a strong relationship between
the mechanical properties of MoS2 and the structural symmetry
of its crystal. Accordingly, the impacts of the external pressure
on the mechanical properties of MoS2 also greatly vary
with respect to the structural phases. Among all of the considered
phases, the 2H and 3R MoS2 have a larger bulk modulus,
Young’s modulus, shear modulus, and microhardness due to their
higher stability. Conversely, 1T and 1T′ MoS2 are
less strong. As such, 1T and 1T′ MoS2 can be a better
candidate for strain engineering.

1 Introduction
Layer-structured
materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs), have attracted intensive attention recently due to their specific
physical and chemical properties and potential applications.1−3 One of the most important and widely studied layer-structured materials
is molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which has the demonstrated
high capacity for use in electronic devices, hydrogen storage, catalysts,
solar cells, hydrogen production, and solid lubricants.4 Many large-scale applications of MoS2 are directly or indirectly determined by its mechanical characteristics,
such as elastic constants, bulk modulus (B), shear
modulus (G), Young’s modulus (Y), Poisson’s ratio (σ), and microhardness (H).5−7 The bulk modulus indicates the resistance to fracture deformation,
which is closely related to the cohesive energy of materials or bonding
energy between atoms in the crystal structure. The shear modulus represents
the plastic deformation of the material. Young’s modulus is
a parameter representing the stiffness of a solid, which is also a
function of atomic bond strength. Poisson’s ratio is a measure
of the Poisson effect, the phenomenon in which a material tends to
expand in directions perpendicular to the direction of compression,
and microhardness indicates the resistance of the physical object
against compression of the contacting parts.

Most previous studies
have particularly focused on the mechanical
properties of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 monolayers.7−11 However, few-layered MoS2 is also widely used in practical
applications,12,13 whose properties are more similar
to the bulk MoS2.14 This is
because only the in-plane mechanical properties need to be taken into
consideration for the monolayers due to the absence of interlayer
interactions. For bulk MoS2, however, the interlayer breathing
and shear modes become important to holistically understand their
mechanical properties,15 and the in-plane
mechanical properties of MoS2 have also been demonstrated
to be directly related to their thickness.15,16 It was also suggested that the mechanical properties of MoS2, particularly Young’s modulus, is strongly dependent
on the interlayer sliding in the multilayers or bulk.17 As such, due to the many different properties of bulk TMDs
with respect to their monolayers, the mechanical properties of bulk
MoS2 with different structural phases are needed to be
investigated. Previous studies have evidenced that bulk MoS2 has at least five phases, e.g., 2H, 3R, 1T, 1T′, and 1T″,
with significantly different structural and electronic properties.4,8,18,19 As such, their performance in specific applications is strongly
related to their structural phases. For example, Zhao et al. found
that 3R MoS2 has distinct electronic and optical properties
arising from its crystal structure.20 2H
MoS2 is a thermodynamically stable semiconductor. Its edge
has been found to be the active site for electrocatalytic hydrogen
evolution reactions (HERs).21 2H-MoS2 has also been widely used as a support for catalysis due
to the specific 2D structure and high thermodynamic and chemical stability.
The 1T phase displays a comparatively higher rate of charge transfer,
which provides potential advantages in electrochemical applications,22,23 and the 1T MoS2 may be an auxetic material with an intrinsic
in-plane negative Poisson’s ratio.24 Also, the S atoms in the basal plane of the 1T′ phase are
active to HERs.25−28 Previously, the mechanical properties of bulk 2H MoS2 have been reported.29−31 Since the other phases of MoS2 also have
great potential applications, it is crucial to investigate the mechanical
properties of MoS2 with other structural phases. Additionally,
the introduction of external pressure has a remarkable influence on
the mechanical and electronic properties of MoS2.32−37 For example, Feng et al. proposed that the strain-engineered MoS2 may capture a broad range of the solar spectrum.35 Liu et al. demonstrated that thermally induced
nonuniform tensile strain of monolayer MoS2 played a significant
role in grain boundary optical properties.36 Yan et al. revealed that properties of materials could alter under
external pressure.37 The pressure effects
on the properties of MoS2 are essential to its application
as a lubricant.38 To this end, the understanding
of the impact of external pressure is also of paramount importance.
However, accurate experimental measurements of the mechanical properties
of bulk MoS2 materials with various phases are impeded
by several issues, such as the availability of their high-quality
single crystals.26,39 The alternative route is to compute
the mechanical properties of MoS2 since the high-level
computations have the demonstrated capacity to provide accurate mechanical
properties of single-crystal materials. The significant pressure-induced
effects on the mechanical properties of 2H-MoS2 have already
been theoretically confirmed by Wei and Peelaers et al.30,40 However, the pressure impact on the mechanical properties of MoS2 with other structural phases is largely unknown.

In
this study, the effects of both the structural phase and external
pressure on the mechanical properties of 2H, 3R, 1T, and 1T′
MoS2 have been systematically investigated using the first-principles
density functional theory (DFT) method. The 1T″ phase was not
considered here because it is least thermodynamically stable and no
layered bulk 1T″ MoS2 has been reported.8,19 Our results reveal the strong dependence of mechanical properties
of MoS2 on the symmetry of its prismatic unit and thermodynamic
stability.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
atomic configurations of MoS2 in different phases (2H,
1T, 3R, and 1T′). 2H and 3R MoS2 have the trigonal
prismatic unit with the symmetry of D3h. The hexagonal 2H-polytype has two layers per unit
cell along the c-axis, and the rhombohedral 3R-polytype
has three layers per unit cell. 1T MoS2 has molybdenum
atoms octahedrally coordinated by S atoms to form a unit cell. 1T′
is a lightly distorted atomic structure of 1T. After structural optimization,
2H, 3R, 1T, and 1T′ possess hexagonal (crystal class: 6/mmm), trigonal (crystal class: 3m), trigonal
(crystal class: 3®m), and monoclinic lattice
systems, respectively. The optimized structures are provided in the Supporting Information.

are the unit cells used in
this study.

The calculated lattice constants,
monolayer thicknesses, and Mo–S
bond lengths are listed in Table 1 in comparison with available experimental and theoretical
data. The initial structures of 1T, 2H, and 3R MoS2 are
from the experiments.41−43 The 1T′ structure is built based on a similar
structure of 1T′ ReS2 due to the lack of direct
experimental data.44 Our results of 2H,
1T, and 3R MoS2 using the DFT-D3 approach are in good agreement
with the experimental results and the theoretical results with dispersion
corrections. From the optimized results, the 2H and 3R phases have
similar structures. Additionally, the 1T′ phase has the shortest
interlayer distance, as evidenced by the smallest average layer thickness,
and 1T′ MoS2 has the lowest monoclinic structural
symmetry. Consequently, two sets of Mo–S bond lengths and S–Mo–S
bond angles are provided in Table 1.

The electrical
conductivity of different phases of MoS2 was also investigated
through the analyses of their total density
of states (TDOS), as shown in Figure 2. It can be found that there is a band gap for the
2H and 3R structures, indicating the fact that the material in both
phases behaves as a semiconductor. On the other hand, 1T phases have
metallic characteristics. Our results agree with the reported conclusion.4,18 Dobson and his co-workers reported that the interactions between
layers of 2D materials are significantly determined by their electrical
conductivity.47 As such, 1T MoS2 should possess stronger interlayer interactions, which has been
confirmed by the calculated interlayer interaction energies of different
phases (see Figure S2). The stronger interlayer
interaction in 1T MoS2, therefore, leads to the smallest
average layer thickness. 1T′ has the weakest interlayer interaction
energies, which may be due to its zigzag atomic structures (see Figure S2). Our calculation suggests that the
MoS2 1T′ phase is metallic while the evolution at
Fermi energy level is small, which is different from recent results,
which show that the 1T′ monolayer has a very narrow band gap.48,49 The discrepancy can be caused by 2-fold reasons. First, the narrow
band gap can only be identified using a high-level and time-consuming
method. Second, studies on 2H-MoS2 demonstrate that the
2H monolayer has a much larger band gap value when compared to the
few layers and bulk system. The same trend is also expected here.
Since the mechanical properties of MoS2 are focused on
and it has been demonstrated later that reasonable mechanical properties
can be obtained at the PBE-D3 level, the PBE-D3 method has been used
throughout this study.

To validate our calculation method
for the investigation of mechanical
properties, we then compared our calculated mechanical properties
of 2H MoS2 with the reported data, which are listed in Table 2. The similarities
of the experimental data with ours can be ascribed to the consideration
of vdW interactions.40,50 One exception is C12, which is positive from our calculations, while the
experimental value is negative.51 However,
our result matches the reported theoretical data.30,40 Our elastic constants are also in good agreement with the experimental
data and previous studies using the high-level hybrid DFT method with
consideration of dispersion corrections. As a comparison, previous
data obtained using the method without the vdW correction show the
relatively large deviation of C13, C33, and C44 values
from the experiments.40 It demonstrates
the importance of the inclusion of vdW corrections when the mechanical
properties of layer-structured materials are investigated.

Our calculated elastic constants of 2H, 3R, 1T, and
1T′
MoS2 are shown in Figure 3. According to the Born–Huang criteria,52 a mechanically stable 2D sheet would satisfy C66 = (C11 – C12)/2 > 0 and C11C22 – C122 > 0. Based
on
our results, it can be found that all four phases of MoS2 are mechanically stable. The elastic constants of 2H and 3R MoS2 are similar. This can be ascribed to the subtle structural
difference because they have similar prismatic units. As a comparison,
Mo atoms are octahedrally coordinated by S atoms in the 1T and 1T′
phases (see Figure 1). As such, the elastic constants of 1T and 1T′ are different
from those of 2H and 3R MoS2. Additionally, the elastic
constants of 1T are also considerably different from those of 1T′.
This could be attributed to the different structural symmetry (trigonal
and monoclinic crystal systems for the 1T and 1T′, respectively),
while their prismatic units are similar.

Figure 3 Calculated elastic constants
of 2H, 1T, 3R, and 1T′ MoS2.

Figure 4 shows the
different mechanical properties of the four structural phases. Due
to the similarities of the prismatic unit structure, the 2H and 3R
phases exhibit a comparatively similar bulk modulus of 55 GPa. 1T
and 1T′ possess smaller bulk moduli, 43 and 49 GPa, respectively.
Bulk modulus is employed to describe the resistance of a material
under compressive loads, which reveals the response of a material
to stress and strain. As such, all phases hold comparatively similar
resistances against external loads, and 2H and 3R phases show a higher
withstanding ability compared to the other two structural phases.
Moreover, 1T and 1T′ MoS2 also have a lower shear
modulus (32 and 34 GPa for 1T and 1T′, respectively) compared
to the other two phases (39 and 38 GPa for 2H and 3R, respectively).
The lower G value suggests the material to be less
rigid and easy for its deformation. Figure 4 also shows that Y and H have similar trends as B and G values and 1T and 1T′ have lower values in comparison
with the 2H and 3R phases. These characteristics are directly related
to the structural stability of the material. Figure S2 shows that 2H and 3R have stronger cohesive interactions,
which matches the experiments since they are more thermodynamically
stable. As such, the positive relationship between B, G, Y, and H values
with cohesive energies is confirmed based on our results. The lowest B, G, Y, and H values of 1T suggest that the 1T phase exhibits the least stiff
and the most flexible configuration among all other phases. Additionally,
similar Poisson’s ratio of the four phases suggests that their
resistance capacities to the shape deformation are close. Pugh once
suggested using the ratio of B/G to distinguish ductility and brittleness of a material.53 The critical value that separates ductile and
brittle materials is around 1.75. The material with a B/G ratio lower than 1.75 behaves in a brittle manner.
From Figure 4, it can
be found that all four phases have a similar B/G ratio of ∼1.4, which is lower than the critical
value of 1.75. It indicates that all MoS2 tend to behave
more in a brittle manner.

modulus, Poisson’s

While the average mechanical properties have been provided and
discussed, it should be kept in mind that all mechanical properties
of MoS2 are anisotropic. To provide a comprehensive understanding
of the impact of structural phases, the three-dimensional (3D) plots
of Y, G, linear compressibility
(the material volume change along a specific axis of the structure),
and σ are also analyzed and shown in Figures 5 and S3–S6.54,55

of MoS2 in its (a) 2H, (b) 1T, (c) 3R, and (d) 1T′
structural phases.

To understand the influence
of the strain caused by the external
pressure on the mechanical properties of MoS2, the mechanical
features have been investigated under external pressure from 0 to
60 GPa. The pressure-induced structural strains are represented in Figure 6. Our computational
results show that the average monolayer thickness of the structure
with all possible phases decreases with pressure. However, the largest
change of the relative interlayer distance can be found in the 1T
phase since it has a small monolayer thickness caused by the strongest
interlayer interaction strength (see Figure S2). The Mo–S bond lengths also decrease under the external
pressure, as shown in Figure 6. The changes of the bond length of the four phases are similar,
which suggests that the reduction of bond length is mainly affected
by external pressure.

of 2H,
1T, 3R, and 1T′ MoS2 under external pressure, which
are referenced to their equilibrium values (corresponding to 100%).

Accordingly, the mechanical properties of MoS2 are also
affected by external pressure. Almost all elastic constants of MoS2 in four different phases increase significantly over the
pressure range of 0–60 GPa, as shown in Figure 7. The most significant change is C33 values, followed by C11 by increasing the pressure. The pressure-induced change
of mechanical properties of 2H MoS2 was previously investigated
by Wei and Peelaers et al. using GGA and HSE06-D2 methods.30,40 In their study, the increase of C11 and C33 over pressure was also significant. The C33 value of layered materials is related to
the interlayer interactions. The significant change of C33 suggests that the external pressure has a greater impact
on weak van der Waals interlayer interactions. Interestingly, the C11 and C44 values
of the 1T′ MoS2 decrease when the pressure is higher
than 54 GPa. This is because the 1T′ phase undergoes an inverse
Peierls phase transition. As evidenced by the change of its bond angles
shown in Figure 8,
the increase in the S–Mo–S bond angle over the pressure
indicates increased symmetry, which leads to the structural transition
similar to 1T.

values.

Figure 8 Structural change of 2H, 1T, 3R, and 1T′
MoS2 over pressure.

The changes of bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus,
Poisson’s ratio, microhardness, and bulk modulus/shear modulus
ratio under external pressure are shown in Figure 9. It can be found that the values of B, G, and Y increase significantly
with the external pressure, which suggests that exerting external
pressure can enhance the hardness of the MoS2 materials.
All of the phases have a similar trend of changes of B, G, Y, and H.
It demonstrates that the impact of the pressure on these mechanical
properties of bulk MoS2 is insensitive to the structural
phase. There are relatively large fluctuations of σ and B/G values for 1T at 20 GPa. Again, it
may be related to the significant change of their monolayer thickness
and C33 values under this pressure, which
suggests the importance of the accurate description of interlayer
interactions during calculations. Similar to the change of elastic
constants, the G and H values of
1T′ MoS2 decrease when the external pressure is higher than
54 GPa, which can also be ascribed to the inverse Peierls phase transition.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
first-principles DFT calculations were carried out
to investigate the mechanical characteristics of 2H, 3R, 1T, and 1T′
MoS2 with the consideration of the influence of external
pressure. Based on the change of the total energies with the strain,
the elastic constants, B, G, Y,
σ, H, and B/G values were calculated. The comparative results reveal that the
structural phase transition can greatly change the corresponding mechanical
properties. Among the four phases, the 2H and 3R phases have a stronger
resistance to structural deformation as evidenced by the larger bulk
modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, and microhardness.
This can be ascribed to the higher cohesive energy and thermodynamic
stability of these phases. Additionally, 1T MoS2 possesses
the smallest B, G, Y, and H values, which suggests that 1T MoS2 has the smallest stiffness value and is easier to deform. Therefore,
1T MoS2 is more promising for strain engineering. Furthermore,
1T′ MoS2 will undergo an inverse Peierls phase transition
under high external pressure and become 1T with higher symmetry. The
findings of this comparative study have offered a theoretical knowledge
base for engineering mechanical behaviors of the layer-structured
MoS2 materials for their specific applications.

4 Computational Methods
All DFT computations were performed
using the Vienna ab initio
simulation package (VASP).56−58 The generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) with the format of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
was applied for the exchange–correlation functional.59 Since traditional DFT calculations at the PBE
level cannot correctly include the nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) interactions,60 the calculations without dispersion corrections
may underestimate the interaction strengths between layers of 2D materials.
In this regard, the DFT-D3 method was used for dispersion corrections
here.61 A plane-wave basis set with a cut-off
kinetic energy of 520 eV was employed to expand the smooth part of
the wave function (see Figure S1), and
γ point centered (18 × 18 × 4), (18 × 18 ×
3), (18 × 18 × 9), and (9 × 9 × 9) k-point grids for 2H, 3R, 1T, and 1T′ phases of MoS2 were employed, respectively. Before the calculation of mechanical
properties, both the lattice constants and the atomic coordinates
were optimized. All of the atoms were allowed to relax until the Hellmann–Feynman
forces were smaller than 0.02 eV/Å and the convergence criterion
for the self-consistent electronic optimization loop was set to 1
× 10–5 eV. Pulay stress was added to the stress
tensor during the optimization of lattice constants to consider the
impact of the external pressure.

To calculate the elastic constants
of MoS2 according
to generalized Hooke’s law, the energies as a function of train
(ε) in the strain range −2.0% ≤ ε ≤
2.0% with an increment of 0.5% were calculated. The elastic constants Cij were obtained by fitting a second-order polynomial
to the change of the total energy versus applied strain by postprocessing
the VASP calculated data using the VASPKIT code.62 The G and B of MoS2 are calculated by using the universal Voigt–Reuss–Hill
average method 1   2  Here, Voigt bulk modulus (BV), the Reuss bulk modulus (BR), the Voigt shear modulus (GV), and
the Reuss shear modulus (GR) were calculated
as 3   4   5   6  where sij =Cij–1, which is the compliance tensor.

In addition,
Young’s modulus Y, Poisson’s
ratio σ, and the microhardness H can be obtained
as 7   8   9
