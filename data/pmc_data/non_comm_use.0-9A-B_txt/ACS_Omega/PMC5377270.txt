Acetaldehyde, acrolein,
and formaldehyde are the principal toxic
aldehydes present in cigarette smoke and contribute to the risk of
cardiovascular disease and noncancerous pulmonary disease. The rapid
growth of the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has raised
concerns over emissions of these harmful aldehydes. This work determines
emissions of these aldehydes in both free and bound (aldehyde–hemiacetal)
forms and other carbonyls from the use of e-cigarettes. A novel silicon
microreactor with a coating phase of 4-(2-aminooxyethyl)-morpholin-4-ium
chloride (AMAH) was used to trap carbonyl compounds in the aerosols
of e-cigarettes via oximation reactions. AMAH–aldehyde adducts
were measured using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze
hemiacetals in the aerosols. These aldehydes were detected in the
aerosols of all e-cigarettes. Newer-generation e-cigarette devices
generated more aldehydes than the first-generation e-cigarettes because
of higher battery power output. Formaldehyde–hemiacetal was
detected in the aerosols generated from some e-liquids using the newer
e-cigarette devices at a battery power output of 11.7 W and above.
The emission of these aldehydes from all e-cigarettes, especially
higher levels of aldehydes from the newer-generation e-cigarette devices,
indicates the risk of using e-cigarettes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Low-molecular-weight
aldehydes are estimated to be the most toxic
constituents of tobacco products and tobacco smoke.1,2 Three
toxic aldehydes—acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde—have
been ranked by the Institute of Medicine as the most significant cardiovascular
(CV) toxins in tobacco smoke.3 These aldehydes
are present in cigarette smoke (700–800 μg/cigarette
in mainstream smoke),4 cigars, and waterpipes
(hookah and narghile) and are also present in electronic cigarette
(e-cigarette) aerosols.5−8 Although levels of some aldehydes are lower in e-cigarette aerosols
than those in the smoke of conventional tobacco,5,8 a
“safe level” of exposure has not been established.9 Many studies have shown that acute exposure to
even low levels of acrolein can induce dyslipidemia,10 vascular injury,11 endothelial
dysfunction,12 and platelet activation,13 whereas chronic exposures accelerate cardiovascular
disease (CVD).14−18 Indeed, over 92% of the theoretical cardiopulmonary disease (noncancer)
risk due to smoking is attributed to just the three aforementioned
aldehydes, that is, acrolein, 88.5%; acetaldehyde, 2.4%; and formaldehyde,
0.4%.2 Animal experiments have indicated
that acrolein plays a role in carcinogenesis,19,20 macrophage and neutrophil accumulation with the consequent production
of proinflammatory cytokines and proteases,21 suppression of endothelial progenitor cells, and endothelial dysfunction.22−24 Thus, it is necessary to both detect and accurately measure the
aldehydes from aerosols of e-cigarettes to evaluate their harm to
the e-cigarette users and secondhand exposures.

The emission
of aldehydes including acetaldehyde, acrolein,
and
formaldehyde from e-cigarettes has thus raised concern over the health
risk of active and passive exposures.25 Because e-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that vaporize nicotine-containing
solutions known as e-liquids,26,27 the delivered battery
power output dictates the heating coil temperature of the atomizer
and, therefore, the quantity of aldehydes generated from thermal decomposition.8,26 As e-cigarette industry promotes next-generation e-cigarette devices
with sub-ohm resistance coil (∼0.5 Ω) atomizers, the
battery power output is much higher than that of the first- and second-generation
e-cigarette devices. Thus, the emission of aldehydes from new generations
of e-cigarette devices needs to be studied. Additionally, there are
hundreds of different e-liquid brands.27 e-Liquids are a mixture of humectants (propylene glycol and glycerin)
and food-grade flavoring additives that give rise to different aldehydes
when heated (e.g., glycerin makes acrolein, whereas propylene glycol
forms acetaldehyde and formaldehyde).27 Thus, the quantity of the aldehydes in e-cigarette aerosols needs
to be determined to best assess the potential toxicity of these compounds.
Yet, because of their high reactivity, it is difficult to quantify
volatile aldehydes (and other carbonyls), and current methods that
depend solely on capture by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-impregnated
silica gel cartridges are generally criticized to be inaccurate at
the low levels encountered in cigarette smoke and e-cigarette aerosols.28 Moreover, a recent study reported that formaldehyde
may form reversible formaldehyde–hemiacetal that may contribute
to a proportion of the total aldehyde.26 Unfortunately, no study has measured both free aldehydes and aldehyde–hemiacetals
in the aerosols of e-cigarettes.

To address the challenge of
accurately measuring aldehydes in aerosols
of e-cigarettes, we used a newly developed technology that combines
an enhanced carbonyl trapping agent along with a microfabricated silicon
microreactor to capture aldehydes via oximation reactions. This microreactor
approach has demonstrated superior lower limit of detection in an
efficient and quantitative trap of trace carbonyl compounds in air
and exhaled breath.29,30 In addition, we investigated
the contribution of aldehyde-specific hemiacetals to the total aldehyde
presence in the aerosols, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
We report herein the measurements of toxic aldehydes and their respective
hemiacetals in the aerosols generated from both the first-generation
e-cigarettes with cartridges and a second-generation e-cigarette with
a “tank-type” atomizer for vaporization of a number
of popular e-liquids.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
All reagents and solvents,
including formaldehyde, 1,3,5-trioxane, cyclohexanone, acetone (acetone-d6), and poly-4-vinylpyridine (PVP), were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-(2-Aminooxyethyl)-morpholin-4-ium chloride (AMAH)
was synthesized according to a published procedure.30 A popular first-generation e-cigarette blu with a fixed
battery output voltage of 3.7 V along with four cartridges (coil resistance
3.0 Ω) was purchased online from Amazon. A newer-generation
e-cigarette device consisting of an atomizer EVOD2 made by KangerTech
(coil resistance 1.5 Ω) and an iTaste VV V3.0 battery with a
digital voltage output of 3.3–5 V was purchased from a local
e-cigarette store. Three popular e-liquids, EL01–EL03, were
purchased from a local e-cigarette store. Each of these e-liquid products
contained 10 mL of solution with a nicotine level of 6 mg/mL. Another
three flavored e-liquids, EL04–EL06, were purchased from their
manufacturer. These e-liquids contained 7 mL of solution with a nicotine
level of 6 mg/mL. Table 1 lists the characteristics of these e-cigarette cartridges and e-liquids.

2.2 Microreactors
The silicon microreactors
were fabricated from silicon wafers using standard microelectromechanical
system fabrication techniques. The microreactors have been used for
trapping carbonyl compounds in environmental air and exhaled breath.29,30 Detailed fabrication and characterization procedures of the microreactors
for the capture of carbonyl compounds were published elsewhere.29,30 Each microreactor contains thousands of micropillars. The surface
of the micropillars was functionalized with AMAH by infusing a solution
of AMAH (32 μL, 1 × 10–6 mol) in methanol
into a microreactor followed by evaporation of the solvent in a vacuum
oven. Fused silica capillary tubes with 350 μm o.d. and 250
μm i.d. were connected to the inlet and outlet ports of the
microreactor with a silica-based bonding agent, respectively. The
use of AMAH-coated microreactors to capture carbonyl compounds followed
by conversion of AMAH adducts to neutral analytes for gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis have been published elsewhere.30

2.3 Generation of Aerosols
from e-Cigarettes
Aerosols were generated from 10 puffs (puff
duration of 4 s, puff
volume of 91 mL/puff, and puff frequency of 2 puffs/min) and were
collected in Tedlar bags using a software-controlled (FlexiWare) cigarette-smoking
robot (SCIREQ, Montreal, Canada). The puff duration, puff volume,
and puff frequency in this study are within the ranges used by e-cigarette
users.31,32 To study the effect of puffing topography
on the emission of aldehydes in aerosols, polypropylene syringes with
a 60 mL capacity were also used to collect aerosols of e-cigarettes
by manually varying puff duration and puff volume. Whereas the first-generation
e-cigarette has a fixed battery power output of 4.6 W (voltage 3.7
V), the battery power output of the second-generation e-cigarette
was tested at 9.1 W (3.7 V), 11.7 W (4.2 V), 14.7 W (4.7 V), and 16.6
W (5.0 V) for vaporization of e-liquids. Aerosol samples collected
in Tedlar bags were evacuated through the microreactors by a vacuum
pump at a flow rate of 3.5 mL/min for the capture of carbonyl compounds.
For aerosols collected from the EL04, EL05, and EL06 e-liquids at
the battery power output of 14.7 and 16.6 W, the aerosol samples were
diluted 50 times with N2 and then were drawn through the
microreactors because of much higher levels of generated aldehydes.
After the evacuation process, the microreactor was eluted with 150
μL of MeOH followed by addition of an internal reference, AMAH–cyclohexanone
(1 × 10–7 mol). Cyclohexanone was chosen because
it is symmetrical (i.e., no geometrical isomers for the AMAH–cyclohexanone
adduct) and was not detected in e-cigarette aerosols. Calibration
curves of the internal standard against all detected aldehydes at
different concentrations were established for quantitative measurements.
PVP (5 mg) was added to the eluted solutions to neutralize the positively
charged AMAH adducts to AMA (4-(2-aminooxyethyl)morpholine) adducts
(Scheme 1).30 The suspensions were vortex-mixed for 30 s and
allowed to stand for 30 min for the sedimentation of PVP particles,
after which a 2 μL aliquot was used for GC–MS analysis.

2.4 GC–MS Analysis of
Carbonyl Adducts
A Thermo Scientific GC–MS instrument
equipped with an AI
1310 automatic sampler, a TRACE 1310 GC with a split/splitless injector,
and an ITQ 1100 series ion trap MS was used for analysis. The GC had
an Agilent J&W DB-17ms column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25
μm film thickness). The flow rate of the carrier gas helium
was 1.5 mL/min. The column temperature was 50 °C for 1 min, then
increased by 10 °C/min up to 160 °C, and then to 200 °C
by 2 °C/min. After that, the temperature was increased by 12
°C/min up to 280 °C and was held at 280 °C for 5 min.
The total running time was 41 min. The samples were split-injected
with a split flow of 15 mL/min and a split ratio of 10.

2.5 NMR Analysis of Hemiacetals
Ten puffs
(puff volume of 35 mL, puff duration of 4 s, and puff frequency of
1 puff/min) of the aerosols generated by the first-generation e-cigarette
and the second-generation e-cigarette were collected using a 60 mL
polypropylene syringe with a very short rubber tube to connect the
e-cigarette. After collection, the rubber tube and e-cigarette were
immediately removed, and then the syringe was fitted with a stainless
steel
needle to transfer the aerosolized liquid into an NMR test tube in
an ice bath. During the transfer, most of the aerosol condensed and
was collected as liquid. Four hundred microliters of deuterated dimethyl
sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO) was added into the
NMR tube followed by the addition of a known amount of benzene (1.72
× 10–6 mol) as an internal standard. Then, 1H NMR spectra (referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS)) were
immediately taken at 400 MHz. To verify the formation of formaldehyde–hemiacetal
in e-liquids, formaldehyde was also generated by heating 1,3,5-trioxane
and 8 N sulfuric acid at 95 °C accordingly33 and then introduced as a gas into e-liquids. Formaldehyde–hemiacetal
was quantified by relative integration against the known amount of
benzene added as an internal standard.

2.6 Statistical
Data Analysis
All measured
amounts of carbonyl volatile organic compounds were analyzed using
the Wilcoxon test to statistically determine the differences in the
changes in puff voltage, puff volume, and puff duration of e-cigarettes.
A p-value smaller than 0.05 was defined as statistically
significant. The Wilcoxon tests were performed using Minitab version
16.0.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Measurement
of Aldehydes in Aerosols of e-Cigarettes
To measure aldehydes
and other carbonyl compounds in aerosols of
e-cigarettes, we used a sensitive microreactor-capture approach with
an AMAH coating as previously reported (Scheme 1).30 The use of
microreactors with aminooxy coatings for chemoselective capture of
trace carbonyl compounds via oximation reactions has been established.29,30Table 2 lists the
measured amounts of the four most abundant carbonyl compounds in the
aerosols of the blu e-cigarettes at the battery power output of 4.6
W and the newer-generation e-cigarette at the battery power output
of 9.1 W at the same battery output voltage of 3.7 V. All tested e-cigarettes
produced acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde. The amounts of
acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were much higher than that of acrolein
in aerosols of all e-cigarettes. The new-generation e-cigarette with
the tank-type atomizer (EVOD2) and iTaste VV V3.0 battery for vaporization
of the six e-liquids produced much higher levels of aldehydes and
acetone than did the blu e-cigarettes because of the higher battery
power output. Formaldehyde and acrolein in 10-puff aerosols generated
from the six e-liquids by the newer e-cigarette device ranged from
8.2 to 40.4 μg and 1.6 to 5.8 μg, respectively, which
were lower than these aldehydes in mainstream smoke of conventional
cigarettes measured using Health Canada intense puffing regime shown
in Table 2 (formaldehyde
74 μg/cigarette and acrolein 120.4 μg/cigarette).34 The amounts of acetaldehyde and acetone in 10-puff
aerosols of these e-liquids were much lower than those in mainstream
smoke of conventional cigarettes.34 Acetone
in tobacco cigarette smoke has a much less toxic effect than that
of the three aldehydes.2,3 The levels of propionaldehyde
and butyraldehyde in conventional cigarette smoke are much lower than
the levels of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, and the toxic effects
of these two compounds were not documented.2

Canada Intense puffing regime).34

Previous studies of carbonyl compounds
in aerosols of e-cigarettes
have found that generation of aldehydes including acrolein, formaldehyde,
and acetaldehyde was related to the battery power output of the e-cigarette
device and thermal decomposition of humectants and flavoring chemicals
in e-liquids.8,35−37 Several studies
have investigated the mechanisms of thermal decomposition of propylene
glycol and glycerin, which are the main constituents of e-liquids.37−39 Thermal decomposition of propylene glycol generates more acetone,
more acetaldehyde, and less formaldehyde,37,39 whereas thermal decomposition of glycerin results in more acrolein
and formaldehyde.37,38 A recent study have also found
that thermal decomposition of some
flavoring chemicals in e-liquids can exponentially increase the generation
of aldehydes.40 Numerous studies of animal
models have demonstrated the high sensitivity of pulmonary and CV
systems to acrolein and formaldehyde at a relatively low level of
inhalation.19−24 Therefore, newer-generation e-cigarettes with emissions of higher
levels of formaldehyde and acrolein will need further animal studies
to examine the health risk.

Because the puffing topography of
e-cigarettes affects the formation
of toxic aldehydes, we used a simple polypropylene syringe to imitate
the characteristics of e-cigarette users by varying puff volumes and
puff durations in the first-generation blu e-cigarettes with two different
flavor cartridges, that is, Classic Tobacco and Magnificent Menthol.
When puff volume was varied from 20 to 60 mL/puff at a fixed puff
duration of 2 s, the amounts of acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde
were proportionally increased with the puff volume for both Classic
Tobacco and Magnificent Menthol (Figures S1 and S2). For Magnificent Menthol, the amounts of acetaldehyde,
acrolein, and formaldehyde were higher than those for Classic Tobacco
at the same puff conditions (Figure S1).
Varying puff duration from 1 to 6 s at a fixed puff volume of 35 mL/puff
had a more complicated effect as the amount of acetaldehyde, acrolein,
and formaldehyde increased when the duration was increased from 1
to 4 s but then declined as the puff duration was increased to 6 s
for both Classic Tobacco and Magnificent Menthol (Figures S3 and S4). The
maximum amounts of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein were generated
at a puff duration of approximately 4 s/puff. Coincidently, several
studies of puffing topography of e-cigarette users reported average
puff durations between 3.5 and 4.3 s.31,32

Because
increasing the battery power output of newer e-cigarette
devices increases the atomizer coil temperature that results in emissions
of more aldehydes in aerosols of e-liquids,8,26,36 we investigated the effect of the battery
power output of the newer e-cigarette device on the generation of
carbonyl compounds in aerosols of e-liquids. EL04 and EL05 generated
much more carbonyl compounds at a power output of 11.7 W (voltage
4.2 V) and above. Figure 1 shows GC–MS chromatograms of AMAH and its adducts
from the aerosol samples collected from EL05 at the battery power
output of 11.7 W (4.2 V), 14.7 W (4.7 V), and 16.6 W (5.0 V). Acetaldehyde,
acrolein, formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and butyraldehyde were detected.
Increasing the power from 11.7 to 16.6 W resulted in dramatic increases
in the levels of these aldehydes (Table 3). Similar results of dramatic increases
in acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde with increasing vaping
power output to 9 and 10 W have been reported.36 High battery power output results in overheating of the
coil and leads to excessive aldehyde generation by thermal decomposition
of humectants (“dry puff” condition).36

3.2 Measurement of Hemiacetals
in Aerosols of
e-Cigarettes
Hemiacetals are formed when alcohols, such as
propylene glycol in e-liquids, add reversibly to the carbonyl functional
group of aldehydes, as shown in Scheme 2. The reaction between formaldehyde and propylene glycol
or glycerin of e-cigarette liquids during vaporization is, therefore,
thought to form measurable formaldehyde–hemiacetal, as detected
using 1H NMR spectroscopy.26

Scheme 2 Reversible Formation of a Hemiacetal through the Reaction of an Aldehyde
and an Alcohol
A recent report have
suggested that emission of formaldehyde in
e-cigarette aerosols is higher than a direct measurement of formaldehyde
because a portion of formaldehyde is sequestered in the form of a
hemiacetal, which prompted more health concerns over using e-cigarettes.26 Unfortunately, this work on the measurement
of formaldehyde–hemiacetal did not measure free or unreacted
formaldehyde or any other aldehydes in the aerosols of the e-cigarettes.
The work was generally criticized for using unrealistic battery output
power (voltage of 5 V) for the measurement of formaldehyde–hemiacetal.41 The reported formaldehyde–hemiacetal
in aerosols was generated from e-liquid EL04. Thus, there is a need
to measure total aldehydes in the aerosols of other e-cigarettes,
especially for newer-generation e-cigarettes with variable battery
power output and highly variable e-liquid compositions that could
influence hemiacetal formation (e.g., humectant and flavoring chemicals
as well as nicotine concentration). To quantify the fraction of aldehydes
that reacted with propylene glycol and/or glycerin to form hemiacetals
in the aerosols of e-cigarettes, we collected aerosolized e-liquids
in NMR tubes containing DMSO-d6 using
the newer e-cigarette device. We initially attempted to detect the
formation of a formaldehyde-derived hemiacetal in aerosols of all
e-cigarettes in Table 1. No formaldehyde–hemiacetal signal was detected in any of
the aerosols generated from the first-generation blu e-cigarettes
with all tested puff volume and puff duration scenarios (data not
shown). No hemiacetal was detectable in the aerosols of EL01, EL02,
and EL03 at any battery power output from 9.1 to 16.6 W as shown in Figure 2a. In a positive
control experiment, formaldehyde gas was introduced into EL01 e-liquid,
and under this condition, a triplet signal at δ 6.18 ppm and
a doublet signal at δ 4.61 ppm were observed, confirming the
formation of a formaldehyde–hemiacetal in this e-liquid (Figure 2b). Thus, the lack
of detectable formaldehyde–hemiacetal in aerosols of the first-generation
e-cigarette and e-liquids EL01, EL02, and EL03 was likely related
to the generally low amount of formaldehyde present in these aerosols,
even at higher battery power output.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra (DMSO-d6)
for detection of hemiacetals: (a) e-liquid EL01 vaporization at the
battery power output of 16.6 W (no hemiacetal detected) and (b) e-liquid
EL01 spiked with formaldehyde.

Formaldehyde hemiacetal in aerosols of EL05 was detected
at the
battery power output from 11.7 to 16.6 W using NMR. No other aldehyde
hemiacetal such as acetaldehyde hemiacetal and acrolein hemiacetal
was detected. Figure 3 shows that there was an increase in peak intensity of the hemiacetal
as the e-cigarette battery power output was increased from 11.7 to
16.6 W. The limit of detection of formaldehyde–hemiacetal using
NMR was determined to be 7.1 μg/10 puffs. The formaldehyde–hemiacetal
level was below the limit of detection at a battery power output of
9.1 W. The amounts of formaldehyde–hemiacetal in aerosol increased
as the power was increased, and the calculated amounts (mean ±
SD) of hemiacetal were based on the internal standard (Figure 4). At a battery power output
of 11.7 W, 78.6 ± 23.8 μg/10 puffs of formaldehyde hemiacetal
was measured, whereas at 16.6 W, 250.4 ± 56.1 μg/10 puffs
of the hemiacetal was measured. We were able to estimate the amount
of the bound formaldehyde to be 22.2 ± 6.7 and 70.7 ± 15.8
μg from the measured formaldehyde–hemiacetal at 11.7
and 16.6 W, respectively. These amounts of formaldehyde could be released
from the reversible reaction of formaldehyde–hemiacetal. Given
the puff volume of 35 mL of this work, we could estimate that the
formaldehyde in formaldehyde–hemiacetal could be approximately
44.6% of free formaldehyde at the power output of 11.7 W and approximately
22.4% of free formaldehyde at the power output of 16.6 W. Higher formaldehyde
levels of 380 (puff volume of 50 mL for 10 puffs) was reported from
formaldehyde–hemiacetal at the e-cigarette voltage output of
5 V for vaporization of EL04 e-liquid.26

in 10 puffs of aerosols collected from e-liquid EL05 at the battery
power output of 11.7, 14.7, and 16.6 W.

The effects of tobacco products on CVD risk are distinct
from those
on other organ systems. Because of their low capacity to detoxify
xenobiotics,42 CV tissues appear to be
relatively more sensitive to smoking. As a result, effects of smoking
on CV tissues appear at exposure levels far lower than those that
cause other diseases, such as cancer.43 Moreover, in contrast to cancer, substantial
CVD risk is associated even with very light smoking, such that 80%
of the risk of smoking >20 cigarettes per day is associated with
<3
cigarettes per day.44 These published data
suggest that even though there may be a decrease in the risk of other
diseases with e-cigarette use, substantial harm to the CV system could
occur because of high sensitivity of this target system to aldehydes.
The emission of aldehydes including acrolein, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde
in aerosols of e-cigarettes as measured in this study supports the
need to maintain an appropriate level of concern over active and passive
exposures to harmful emissions of e-cigarettes and calls for more
research on the newer-generation e-cigarettes and their potentially
harmful effects.
