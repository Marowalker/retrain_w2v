A bisthiocarbonohydrazone-based
chemosensor molecule (R1) containing a tetrahydro-8-hydroxyquinolizine-9-carboxaldehyde
moiety
has been synthesized and characterized as a new ratiometric fluorescent
probe for picric acid (PA). The ratiometric probe R1 is
a highly selective and sensitive colorimetric chemosensor for PA.
The association between the chemosensor and PA and the ratiometric
performance enabled by the key role of excited state intramolecular
proton transfer in the detection process are demonstrated. Selectivity
experiments proved that R1 has excellent selectivity
to PA over other nitroaromatic chemicals. Importantly, the ratiometric
probe exhibited a noteworthy change in both colorimetric and emission
color, and this key feature enables R1 to be employed
for detection of PA by simple visual inspection in silica-gel-coated
thin-layer chromatography plates. Probe R1 has been shown
to detect PA up to 3.2 nM at pH 7.4. Microstructural features of R1 and its PA complex have been measured by a field emission
scanning electron microscope, and it clearly proves that their morphological
features differ dramatically both in shape and size. Density function
theory and time-dependent density function theory calculations were
performed to establish the sensing mechanism and the electronic properties
of probe R1. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the utility
of probe R1 for the detection of PA in live Vero cells
for ratiometric fluorescence imaging.

Introduction
Selective,
sensitive, and prompt detection of explosives has received
substantial attention in recent years because of the well-organized
terror attacks all over the world and their implications in homeland
protection, global demining, and environmental welfare.1−4 Nitro compounds constitute the bulk of many common explosive mixtures.
Nitroaromatics are extensively used in industry for various purposes
from synthesis of dyes, polymers, and plastics to pesticides and pharmaceuticals.5,6 They are also used as byproducts of fuel combustion in vehicles
and power plants.7 2,4,6-Trinitrophenol,
better known as picric acid (PA), has been exhaustively utilized by
military powers as a high explosive ever since Hermann Sprengel proved
in 1871 that it could be detonated. It is reported that the explosive
nature of PA is even greater than that of TNT.8,9 Owing
to its water-soluble nature, PA has proven to be exceptionally hazardous
to all life forms. Repercussions from eye contact and inhalation can
be dangerous. Lung disorders,
asphyxiation, and even death are not unlikely consequences of exposure
to high concentrations of PA, caused by infiltration of the chemical
into the environment. In view of these facts, the development of simple
and cost-effective techniques for detecting and purging environmental
PA has become extremely important. Fluorescence signaling is a preferred
technique among various methods used for
detection of nitroderivatives because of its high sensitivity and
selectivity.10−12 In addition, a fluorescence turn-on signal for sensing
applications is generally considered to be superior to a turn-off
signal.11,13 Literature studies revealed that reports
of research findings for selective detection of PA through fluorescence
turn-on signals are scarce.14,15 Furthermore, most of
the reported PA-sensitive fluorescent sensors reveal only fluorescence
intensity-based optical signal changes that are linked to many factors
such as sensor concentration, environment, and excitation intensity.
In comparison, ratiometric measurements based on the intensity ratios
at two wavelengths come with the advantages of self-calibration of
two emission bands and enhanced dynamic range of fluorescence measurement.16,17 To the best of our knowledge, only one instance of ratiometric detection
of PA in environmental and battlefield samples has been documented
so far.18 Thus, it is of immense interest
to develop new ratiometric probes targeted toward PA sensing that
can be safely applied in biological systems. It is important to note
that our new thiobiscarbohydrazide imine of aminosalicylaldehyde probe
(R1) is the first ratiometric fluorescent probe that
is useful for fluorescence detection of PA in environmental and biological
settings.

In this work, we describe a very efficient PA sensor
bis-Schiff-base
derived from very weak luminescent-substituted aminosalicylaldehyde.19 We show that the sensing mechanism of R1 involves excited intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)
followed by supramolecular association. Sensor R1 is
a versatile performer in that it can detect PA in solution (including
aqueous medium, which is a highly desirable property) and in the solid
state. The sensor is also successful at detecting trace amounts of
PA ratiometrically in live cells. The utility of the probe lies in
its easy synthetic procedure and high sensitivity compared with other
reported PA sensors (see Table S5).

Results
and Discussion
A solution of 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-8-hydroxy-1H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-9-carboxaldehyde
(2 equiv) in ethanol (2.5 mL) was added slowly to a solution of thiocarbohydrazide
(1 equiv) in water (0.5 mL). Initially, this results in turbidity,
but at the end of the complete addition, the solution becomes clear.
The reaction mixture was refluxed with stirring for 24 h. A precipitate
formed, which was cooled, filtered, and washed with ethanol and then
with ether. It was air-dried to give powder of 8-hydroxybenzoquinolizine-conjugated
bisthiocarbonohydrazones product (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Preparation of R1
Compound R1 was
characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass, and
elemental analyses. The 1H NMR
spectrum of compound R1 showed one singlet at 11.48 ppm
for the amide (−NH) proton (2H), one singlet at 8.62 ppm for
the imine −CH proton (2H), one singlet at 8.23 ppm for the
only aromatic proton present in R1 (2H), one singlet
at 6.72 ppm for the phenolic OH proton (2H), and three multiplets
at 3.12–1.83 ppm for nonaromatic protons (8H, 8H, 8H) (see Figure S1). The mass spectrum of compound R1 showed a parent ion peak at m/z 505.2341 (M + 1)+ (see Figure S2). These spectroscopic data validate the structure
of R1.

To understand the selective and sensitive
niroaromatic chemical
(NAC) sensing behavior of probe R1, absorption and fluorescence
titrations were carried out. The free probe R1 [0.1 μM,
DMSO/H2O (2:8; v/v), HEPES pH 7.4] displayed two major
absorption bands at 230 and 367 nm, which are attributed to the π–π*
transition of the azomethine (C=N) species and the presence
of keto species owing to the keto–enol tautomerization of the
imino–phenolic core, respectively. The solution of probe R1 exhibits a light yellow color because of the low π–π*
transition of the chromophore. Upon titration of probe R1 with PA (1.0 μM) solution, the red-shifted absorbance of the
∼292 and 500 nm bands increases and that of the 230 and 367
nm bands decreases (Figure 1a). The color of the solution of probe R1 was
changed from yellow to red, which could be easily observed by the
naked eye (inset: Figure 1a). Thus, the spectral changes and three well-defined isosbestic
points at 262, 308, and 453 nm were observed, indicating the formation
of a new species upon treatment of probe R1 with PA,
whereas the other NACs exhibit no significant change in the absorption
spectra (Figure 1b).

equiv). Inset shows the color change before (yellow) and after (red)
the addition of PA to R1. (b) Change in absorbance intensity
of R1 in the presence of different analytes.

The formation of these hydrogen bonds affects the
electronic properties
of the chromophore, which are responsible for the color change with
a subsequent new charge-transfer interaction between the protonated
species and electron-deficient picrate anion.20 The strong binding affinity of PA allowed the Job’s plot
method (see Figure S8) to be used in the
determination of the binding stoichiometry, which was found to be
a 1:2 probe-to-picrate anion complexation.

After obtaining good
results in absorption titration, we carried
out fluorescence titration and found that the sensor exhibited a ratiometric
fluorescent response to PA. The free probe R1 (0.1 μM)
displayed an intense fluorescence emission at 496 nm when excited
at 367 nm in pH 7.4 HEPES buffer (DMSO/H2O: 1:4, v/v).
However, as shown in Figure 2a, the addition of PA (1.0 μM) elicited a drastic decrease
in emission at 496 nm and simultaneous appearance of a new emission
band at 454 nm, attributed to the local emission (Scheme 2).

Figure 2 (a) Emission spectra
of R1 (λex =
367 nm) [0.1 μM, DMSO/H2O, 1:4 (v/v), HEPES buffer

change before (intense green) and after (low intense blue) the addition
of PA to R1. (b) Change in fluorescence intensity ratio
(F454/F496) of R1 [0.1 μM, DMSO/H2O, 1:4 (v/v),
HEPES buffer at pH 7.4] with respect to concentration of PA (1.0 μM).

Scheme 2 Probable Mode of Binding of PA with R1
Thus, the probe offered
a significant ratiometric fluorescent response
(I454/I496) to PA (Figure 2b),
and this property can render the probe concentration immune to photobleaching
or other environmental effects.21 As displayed
in Figure 1a, probe R1 exhibited a remarkable emission shift (42 nm), and the
fluorescence intensity ratios of probe R1 at 454 and
496 nm (F454/F496) showed a drastic change from 0.09 in the absence of PA to 0.65
in the presence of PA (2.0 equiv) (Figure 2b), a 7.5-fold variation in the emission
ratio. The ratio of emission intensity has an excellent linear relationship
with PA from 0 to 0.2 μM. A statistically applicable linear
relationship was observed between the fluorescence enhancement and
the concentration of the analyte that underlines the applicability
of the probe for PA sensing. From the calibration curves, the limit
of detection (LOD) was calculated using the formula LOD = 3σ/S (S/N = 3), where σ is the relative standard deviation
and S is the slope of the calibration curve.22 It was found that the LOD of probe R1 is 3.2 nM (see Figure S9), which is quite
lower than that of previously reported literature.23−31 We also created a Job’s plot using the fluorescence method
and found a 1:2 interaction between PA and receptor R1 (Figure 3c).

Govindaraju et al.32 used the probe
as a fluorescence quencher for the detection of Cu2+. In
this context, we also found that the fluorescence intensity of the
probe is gradually quenched upon the addition of Cu2+ (see Figure S16). However, other metal ions did not
show any considerable change in fluorescence intensity up to 5.0 equiv
(see Figure S17). Hence, the probe was
unable to detect PA in the presence of Cu2+ (see Figure S18). However, the focus of our work is
the ratiometric response of the probe toward PA, which is entirely
different from the fluorescence quenching elicited by copper.

The intense fluorescence displayed by the free probe is believed
to be due to ESIPT. The species responsible for ratiometric emission
are the phototautomer excited enol (T*) and keto (N*) forms, which
result from an ESIPT (T* ⇌ N*) process (Scheme 3). Molecules in which acidic and basic moieties
lie in close proximity often exhibit ESIPT; in our system, proton
migration from salicyl −OH to the Schiff base nitrogen in the
excited state generates keto–enol and imine–amine tautomers,
which have been well documented in the literature.33−35 With increasing
concentration of PA, the fluorescence intensity of the probe gradually
decreases at 496 nm with an increasing spectral emission shift at
454 nm, as shown in Figure 2a. Upon photoexcitation of probe R1 in the presence
of PA, the salicyl −OH of the probe transforms to basic amine
N–H and undergoes strong H-bonding with the nitro group of
PA, leading to inhibition of the ESIPT process, which causes the fluorescence
to switch off, and probe R1 shows only local fluorescence
emission at 454 nm.

Scheme 3 ESIPT Mode of R1
The change in fluorescence properties of R1 depends
on the nature of the analytes—whether they are aromatic or
aliphatic as well as number of nitro groups present. First, the fluorescence
quenching ability of a nitroalkane such as nitromethane is lower than
that of the nitroaromatic compounds (see Table S3). Also, the ratiometric behavior of R1 toward
nitroalkenes is lower than corresponding nitroaromatics (see Table S4). This indicates that the interaction
between nitroaromatic compounds and the fluorophore of probe R1 causes fluorescence quenching more easily. These results
are similar to those previously reported.36−39 Second, nitroaromatics having
more electron-deficient groups are the most efficient quenchers among
aromatic analytes.24 For example, the fluorescence
quenching is more intensive when there are more nitro groups on the
aromatic ring (see Table S3). Furthermore,
the hydrogen bond interaction between PA with the basic amine NH of
probe R1 may also be favorable for enhancing the energy
transfer ability to quench40 the fluorescence
of probe R1. Therefore, PA has the best quenching effect
of all, which also suggests that the basic amine type NH has a good
selectivity for PA. This
hydrogen bonding interaction inhibited the ESIPT process, which is
responsible for the ratiometric fluorescence. The emission behavior
of R1 did not vary with the addition of 5 equiv of trifluoroacetic
acid, which has the same pKa as PA (see Figure S14). This result suggests that the ratiometric
behavior is not due to simple protonation but due to protonation followed
by hydrogen bonding interaction between R1 and PA.

To establish the ESIPT mode of the probe, we synthesized a model
compound (MR1), which is the O-methylated derivative of compound R1 (Scheme S1). Compound MR1 is
nonfluorescent in DMSO and exhibits no significant change in fluorescence
intensity upon the addition of 5 equiv of PA (Figures S21 and S22). First, the compound is nonfluorescent
due to inhibition of the ESIPT process. Second, as MR1 does not show
any change in fluorescence intensity in the presence of excess PA,
it is proved that the interaction between sensor and analyte is reliant
upon the presence of the phenolic −OH group.

To check
the selective detection of PA over other NACs, we carried
out fluorescence titration experiments of probe R1 in
the presence of various nitroaromatics such as PA, 4-nitrophenol (4-NP),
2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), TNT, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 3,4-dinitrotoluene
(3,4-DNT), 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA), 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), 1,3-dinitrobenzene
(1,3-DNB), nitrobenzene (NB), and nitromethane (NM).

In this
regard, solutions of probe R1 (0.1 ×
10–6 M, pH 7.4 HEPES buffer, DMSO/H2O:
1:4, v/v) were mixed separately with a fixed amount of NAC (10 equiv)
except for PA and left for 30 min to occupy all available interaction
sites on R1. Fluorescence spectra of the respective solutions
showed negligible changes in spectral features, as evident from Figure 4a (black bar), whereas
incremental additions of PA to the aforementioned solutions (R1 + NACs) showed a continual quenching of fluorescence intensity
at 496 nm (∼80–85%) (Figure 4b, green bar).

Figure 4 (a) Change in fluorescence
intensity of R1 (at 496
nm, λex = 367 nm) [0.1 μM, DMSO/H2O, 1:4 (v/v), HEPES buffer at pH 7.4] in the presence of 10.0 equiv
of different analytes (black bar) and the addition of PA (1.0 μM)
to it (green bar). (b) Change in the fluorescence intensity ratio
(F454/F496) of R1 (at 496 nm, λex = 367 nm) [0.1

in the presence of 10.0 equiv of different analytes (blue bar) and
addition of PA (1.0 μM) to it (brown bar).

We also carried out the same experiment to check the ratiometric
behavior of the probe, and no significant effect of other nitroaromatics
toward the sensitivity of PA was observed (Figure 4b). Hence, of all of these nitro explosives,
notably only PA exhibited a significant change in emission intensity
and hence selectivity.

The corresponding room light and visual
fluorescent color change
experiments have been carried out to look at the behavior of R1 in the presence of various NACs. Under UV light irradiation,
the solution of R1 is deep green, whereas in the presence
of PA, it shows a nonfluorescent color that is otherwise not present
in the other NACs studied (Figure 3a). Therefore, PA can easily be differentiated by a
visual color change from the other NACs. At a response time of <1
min, probe R1 shows prompt fluorimetric response to PA
addition (see Figure S10), which implies
that it is quite handy for quick detection of PA in aqueous media.

The fluorescence response of probe R1 to PA at different
pH values was also investigated. Different buffer solutions of pH
values ranging from 1 to 13 were prepared by mixing sodium hydroxide
solution and hydrochloric acid in HEPES buffer. Then, we continued
to investigate the effect of pH on the fluorescence intensity of probe R1 in the absence or presence of PA. In the absence of PA,
almost no apparent changes in fluorescence intensity were observed
in the free probe R1 over a wide pH range of 3–13
(Figure S11). In addition, the fluorescence
responses of the probe toward PA were almost pH-independent over a
wide pH range of 3–13.

Fluorescence quenching titrations
were carried out to determine
the quenching constant of R1 with PA at 496 nm, and the
quenching efficiency and sensitivity were evaluated by calculating
the Stern–Volmer quenching constant (KSV),41 calculated by the Stern–Volmer
(SV) equation: I0/I =
1 + KSV[PA], where KSV is the quenching constant (M–1), I0 and I are the fluorescence
intensities of complexes before and after the addition of PA, and
[PA] is the molar concentration of PA.

The SV plots showed two
distinct regions: linear variation at a
lower concentration of PA is mainly due to static quenching (Figure 5b), whereas deviation
from linearity occurred on increasing the amount of PA (Figure 5a), presumably due to dynamic
quenching via energy transfer between R1 and PA through
H-bonding or due to the self-absorbance of PA. The value of the quenching
constant KSV has been estimated to be KSV = 4.37 × 104 M–1. This high value of the quenching constant points to the very good
quenching ability of PA toward R1. The above value is
remarkable compared with those of most efficient molecular fluorophores.

plot of R1 using PA as a quencher.
(b) Stern–Volmer plot at lower concentration of PA.

The sensing event can also be studied from an electrostatic
viewpoint.
The highly acidic character of the phenolic moiety in PA, which facilitates
its easy interaction with the basic amine group of probe R1 generating protonated species, is in fact due to the strong electron-withdrawing
effect of the three NO2 substituents. Sun et al. reported
such an electrostatic interaction where the amine group of bovine
serum albumin selectively interacts with the picrate ion.42 To confirm the electrostatic interaction between
probe R1 and the picrate ion, an aqueous sodium nitrate
salt solution (1.0 M) of significantly higher concentration was added
to the probe followed by studying its fluorescence activity toward
PA.

Interestingly, in the presence of a concentrated salt, the
fluorescence
quenching toward PA at 496 nm was found to be very weak (60%) (Figure 6b) compared with
that in the absence of salt addition (85%) (Table S1). Nevertheless, a higher concentration of PA (20 equiv)
was required for the completion of the interaction (Figure 6a). Here, the salt screening
effect of a concentrated NaNO3 solution is at work.43 The higher the concentration of added salt compared
to the concentration of the analyte, the more the hindrance posed
to the electrostatic association of the analyte with the probe. Besides,
at higher concentrations of salt, the metal cation (Na+) may form a soluble salt with the picrate ion, rendering it unavailable
for interaction with the probe, which directly influences its fluorescence
properties.

presence of NaNO3 (1.0 M) and PA (1.0 μM). (b) Percent
quenching at different time intervals.

Furthermore, to know about the possible interactions of R1 towards PA, 1H NMR spectroscopic titrations
were carried
out in DMSO-d6. The 1H NMR
spectrum of R1 displayed characteristic aldimine and
thiocarbonohydrazide protons (Ha and Hb) at
δ 8.62 and 11.48 ppm, respectively, with other aliphatic and
aromatic protons in their respective positions (Figure 7). In the 1H NMR titration experiments,
increasing additions of PA (1.0–3.0 equiv) to a solution of R1 resulted in significant downfield shifts for the peaks
corresponding to the phenolic hydroxy proton and thiocarbonohydrazone
protons because the electron densities of these protons involved in
H-bonds are decreased and the corresponding signals undergo extensive
broadening. At the same time, a new singlet appears at δ 8.75
ppm, which may be associated with the aromatic protons of PA (vide
free PA, δ 9.20 ppm).

Figure 7 1H NMR chart (DMSO, 400 MHz, DMSO-d6, 0.5 mL) of R1 (5 mg) in the
presence of
PA.

On the other hand, a newly generated
broad singlet at δ 12.23
ppm is leading to the protonation of the tertiary amine nitrogen of
probe R1. These results suggested that strong hydrogen
bonding interactions are a crucial driving force for the fluorescence
quenching process. To know the proper binding interaction of R1 with PA, we carried out mass spectra analysis, which shows
a peak at 963.2274 (M + H+) that is consistent with the
theoretical value of 962.2276 for 1:2 binding of R1 and
PA (see Figures S4 and S5).

To investigate
the electronic structure and the electronic transitions
of chemosensor R1 and its PA complex, density function
theory (DFT) geometry optimizations followed by time-dependent density
function theory (TDDFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level44−46 of the Gaussian 09W software package were carried out. The geometry
optimizations for R1 and its PA complex [R1·2PA] (Figure 8) were
carried out in a cascade fashion, starting from semiempirical PM2
followed by ab initio HF to DFT B3LYP by using various basis sets,
viz., PM2 → HF/STO-3G → HF/3-21G → HF/6-31G →
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). For optimization of the complex, a starting model
was generated by taking the DFT optimized probe R1 and
placing the PA well in the carbonohydrazone N–H as hydrogen
bond donor moieties at a noninteracting distance.

Figure 8 Energy minimization structure
of (a) R1 and (b) R1·2PA.

This model was then optimized initially using the
HF/3-21G level
of calculations, and the output structure from this was taken as an
input for DFT calculations performed using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level
for the complex. The optimized structure and graphical representations
of highest occupied (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
(LUMOs) of R1 and its PA complex are shown in Figure 9. For chemosensor R1, FMOs are largely overlapping and distributed in the entire
arylamine and thiocarbanohydrazone backbone. Thus, the intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) character of the sensor is only modest. By sharp
contrast, for the PA complex [R1·2PA] spatial separation
of FMOs is noticeable: the HOMOs are mainly located along the electron-richer thiocarbanohydrazone moiety, whereas
the LUMOs chiefly reside along the most electron-deficient PA moieties.
This orbital distribution suggested that the hydrogen bonding of the
probe should influence the HOMO and LUMO unevenly and thus constitute
the basis of an optical response of the complex. Furthermore, the
HOMO–LUMO energy gap of complex [R1·2PA]
becomes much smaller relative to its probe R1. The energy
gaps between the HOMO and LUMO in probe R1 and its complex
were 74.6 and 64.4 kcal mol–1, respectively (Figure 8).

Figure 9 HOMO–LUMO distribution
of R1 and R1·2PA.

TDDFT calculations were performed to explain the electronic
properties
of the probe and its PA complex in their ground and excited states.
The vertical transitions, that is, the calculated λmax, main orbital transition, and oscillator strength (f) are listed in Table S1. The vertical
transitions calculated by TDDFT were found to have good agreement
with the experimental data. The studies suggest that the vertical
transitions for probe L are observed at ∼435, ∼316,
and ∼266 nm belonging to the HOMO → LUMO (f = 1.9733, 98.8%), HOMO – 2 → LUMO + 1 (f = 0.3910, 93.4%), and HOMO → LUMO + 2 (f = 0.1956, 97.3%) energy states, respectively, and absorption bands
at ∼463, ∼391, and ∼365 nm belonging to the HOMO
→ LUMO + 4 (f = 0.6682, 93.0%), HOMO →
LUMO + 5 (f = 0.1867, 92.8%), and HOMO – 2
→ LUMO (f = 0.2739) energy states, respectively,
for [R1·2PA]. The main contributing transition for
red-shifted absorptions is HOMO → LUMO + 4 (∼93%) for
the PA complex, which corresponds to the lowest energy state that
arises due to ICT (Table S2).

Next,
we sought to understand how
the microscopic structural features of probe R1 change
due to self-aggregation and also to see whether such structures are
intact or form newer types in the presence of PA. Probe R1 exhibits a microrod-like morphology that is well spread all over
the mica surface, as studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) (Figure 10a,b). However, in the presence of PA, this microrod-like morphology
changes and the assembly of microparticles took place, resulting in
a microspherical architecture as noticed by their decreased size along
with nonuniform surface smoothness. It is interesting to perceive
that the microrod-like particles protruded from the surface of the
microspheres (Figure 10c,d). The microscopy data supports the induced supramolecular self-aggregation
in probe R1 upon interaction followed by complexation
by PA to a greater extent as compared with their particle size. It
could also be explained based on hydrogen bonding interaction and
π-stacking interaction at the time of molecular recognition.

During the preparation of explosive
materials, rocket fuels, fireworks,
and so forth, nitroaromatic compounds may contaminate the human body.
PA is not very hazardous in aqueous solution, but when dry, it acts
as a powerful explosive. Dry PA has considerable affinity toward skin
and acts as an effective skin sensitizer. Therefore, detection of
these explosive nitroaromatics is very important in the vapor and
solid states. Thus, we prepared test strips by dip-coating solutions
of R1 in H2O/CH3CN (8:2; v/v) on
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates followed by drying the strips
under vacuum to test the remaining contamination in contact and vapor
modes.

For solid-state detection of PA, a 10 μM (H2O/CH3CN (8:2; v/v)) solution of R1 was adsorbed on
TLC plates and then dried. To investigate the sensitivity of PA toward
the paper strips, we prepared different concentrations of PA (10–9 to 10–4 M) and applied them on
the strips. As shown in Figure 11(IId–i), dark spots result due to spotting different
concentrations of PA. The results suggest that an efficient quenching
of fluorescence intensity was observed even in the solid state. Most
importantly, even a nanomolar concentration (1.0 × 10–9 M) of PA can be detected by this test strip method. Quenching of
fluorescence intensity of different strips is shown in Figure S15a. In this experiment, we achieved
39% quenching efficiency, indicating that R1 is very
sensitive toward PA in the solid state as well (see Figure S15b).

PA on fluorescent TLC plates: (d) 10–4, (e) 10–5, (f) 10–6, (g) 10–7, (h) 10–8, and (i) 10–9 M. (III)
Naked-eye color change: (i) R1 only (1.0 × 10–6 M), (ii) 1.0 μM PA, (iii) 1.5 μM PA,
(iv) 2.5 μM PA, and (v) naked-eye color on logo “TNP”
made by R1 only (left) and after spotting of PA on the
logo (right).

Owing to its sensitivity,
in previously reported literature, only
the fluorescence method was utilized to detect PA on test strips by
simple spotting.25−29 Here, our compound R1 could detect PA not only by fluorescence
spotting but also by naked-eye color changes. As shown in Figure 11(IIIv), the color
of the spotted logo changed from yellow (only R1, 10.0
μM) to red just after the spotting of the solution of PA (0.1
μM). We could also detect a concentration-dependent naked-eye
color change of the test strip upon increasing the amount of PA [Figure 11(IIIi–v)].
Hence, we could detect trace amounts of PA by visualizing the naked-eye
color changes on TLC strips.

After obtaining a good sensitivity
of the probe for PA in the solid
state, we then checked its sensitivity in the vapor phase. To do this,
we placed the fluorescence TLC strip of R1 on the mouth
of the glass vial containing solid PA for 30 min at room temperature. Figure 11(Ib) shows that
fluorescence quenching occurred throughout the TLC strip, indicating
the adsorption of PA vapor on the solid surface.

The fluorescence
spectra of the quenched areas of test strips of R1 were
recorded (Figure 12a) using a front-face technique and were compared with
the emission of the respective test strips only adsorbed with R1 (Figure 11(Ia)). After 30 min of adsorption, we found that nearly 22% quenching
had occurred (Figure 12b). Next, we washed the TLC plate with water and found that quenched
fluorescence was regained (Figure 11(Ic)). This indicates that adsorbed PA was removed
from the test strip, demonstrating the reusability of the strip.

Wet PA, an odorless, yellow solution or wet slurry of yellow
crystals,
tends to lose moisture rapidly and becomes shock-, friction-, and
heat-sensitive and hence prone to decomposition that may cause environmental
pollution and even explosion. Hence, detection of PA as a toxic pollutant
is very much essential not only from organic solvents but also from
natural surface water resources where several interfering agents are
present.

We collected several surface water samples from different
areas
of West Bengal, India (see Supporting Information for complete details) and tested the efficacy of our sensor in detecting
PA in these diverse aqueous media. In this context, we prepared 10
μM solutions of PA in different water samples and observed the
change in emission of R1. In every case, considerable
fluorescence (at 496 nm) quenching was noticed (Figure 13).

Figure 13 Sensing of PA from surface
water specimen by using fluorescence
quenching of R1.

Most importantly, R1 shows ratiometric behavior
with
the addition of PA in different water samples. Thus, we plotted a
graph of F454/F496 with respect to PA present in different water samples and found
the probe to be operating well in all cases (see Figure S13). These results suggest that irrespective of the
source of water, ratiometric fluorescence behavior of R1 is manifested in the presence of PA. These results definitely establish
the capability of R1 as a widespread fluorescent sensor
of PA, an organic nitroaromatic explosive and mutagenic water toxin.

We also tested the sensing ability of R1 by spiking
a soil sample with PA followed by its extraction from the soil matrix.
An impressive 91% PA retrieval was achieved with our sensor, R1 (see Figure S20).

As we
said earlier, PA is a dangerous water pollutant.47,48 Therefore, it can affect tissues and organs of the mammalian system.
Thus, there is an obvious need for easy and quick in vitro detection
of PA in natural water bodies. In developing countries such as India,
the main source of drinking water is ground water, which is also the
habitat for several living organisms. Owing to industrialization,
unwanted pollutants are constantly mixed with the surface and ground
water, making ground water susceptible to contamination with different
toxic substances and pollutants. It thus becomes important to develop
a method for the detection of PA in living cells grown in ground water.
In this context, we collected a ground water specimen from Shalimar,
an industrial area of West Bengal, India, and let Vero cells grow
in the aqueous medium. From fluorescence titration of R1 with PA, as observed in the previous sections, a ratiometric behavior
of the emission spectra was evident. For biological application of
the probe, herein, the Vero cells were incubated with probe for 1
h and were observed under a fluorescence microscope.

A strong
green fluorescence was observed with the green filter
upon excitation with blue light. Additionally, when the cells were
observed under the blue filter, no fluorescence was observed (Figure 14).

Figure 14 Fluorescence microscopic
observation of Vero cells under green
and blue filters. No fluorescence was observed in the control; however,
only green fluorescence was observed after the addition of probe R1. After the addition of PA, green fluorescence was quenched,
and blue fluorescence was enhanced. Scale bar, 100 μm.

The cells were subsequently treated
with PA and incubated for a
further 1 h. After the PA treatment, effective quenching in fluorescence
intensity under the green filter was found with a concomitant increase
in intensity under blue-filter fluorescence (Figure 14). These results reveal that after the treatment
of PA green fluorescence intensity is quenched, and blue fluorescence
intensity is enhanced. This spectral behavior was also found in fluorescence
titration. Therefore, it is evident that the live cell imaging results
and fluorescence titration results corroborate each other. These data
indicate that probe R1 can detect PA ratiometrically
in living cells as well and therefore can be applied for the detection
of PA in live cells grown in environmental ground waters.

Conclusion
In summary, a new chemosensor based on thiocarbonohydrazone (R1) has been synthesized and characterized as a ratiometric
fluorescent probe for PA. Probe R1, whose sensing activity
was observed in HEPES buffer medium, was found to be sensitive and
selective toward PA among different NACs. The selectivity and sensitivity
were established based on fluorescence, absorption, 1H
NMR spectroscopy, HR-MS mass spectrometry, and visual fluorescent
color changes. It is highly sensitive to PA with a low detection limit
(DL) of 3.2 nM, and the KSV value is 4.37
× 104 M–1. Visual detection was
not restricted to the solution phase; thin layer chromatography plates
or solution-coated paper strips were employed as solid-phase sensing
systems. It may be noted that a silica gel plate coated with our probe R1 could identify PA vapor at a concentration as low as 0.5%
within a few minutes at room temperature. This is the first report
of a simple, portable method for detecting PA through a visual color
change on TLC plates. The PA binding characteristics of R1 have been investigated by DFT and TDDFT calculations, which were
carried out to demonstrate the electronic properties of R1 and the corresponding H-bonded PA complex. To know the supramolecular
microstructural features of R1 and the R1–PA complex, FESEM studies were carried out in which the microrod-like
morphology of R1 resulted in the assembling of microparticles
in the complex. The suitability of R1 for ratiometric
fluorescence imaging of PA in living cells was proved by the strong
green fluorescent images observed in Vero cells incubated with probe R1 alone and weak blue fluorescence observed in the same cells
in the presence of PA.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All materials were bought from
commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
400 MHz instrument. For NMR spectra, DMSO-d6 was used as a solvent using TMS as an internal standard. Chemical
shifts are expressed in δ ppm units, and 1H–1H and 1H–C coupling constants are in hertz.
Mass spectra were carried out using a Waters QTOF Micro YA 263 mass
spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer
model LS 55 spectrophotometer. UV spectra were recorded on a JASCO
V-530 spectrophotometer. Elemental analysis of the compounds was carried
out on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 series CHNS/O analyzer. Column chromatography
was carried out by using Silica Gel 60 (60–120 mesh).

General
Method of UV–vis and Fluorescence Titration
For UV–vis
and fluorescence titrations, stock solution of
probe R1 was prepared (c = 0.1 μM)
in H2O/DMSO (4:1, v/v) solution (100 mM HEPES buffer, pH
7.4). A solution of the different guest analytes of concentration
1.0 μM was also prepared in H2O/DMSO (4:1, v/v) solution
(100 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4). The solution of probe R1 was ready by appropriate dilution technique. The spectra of these
solutions were recorded by means of UV–vis and fluorescence
methods. All solvents were purchased from local suppliers and were
used after distillation.

Procedure for the Preparation of Fluorescence
Test Strips
The fluorescent test strips were prepared by
dip coating a TLC
plate in the solution of R1 in H2O/CH3CN (4:1) followed by drying these strips in vacuum.

Procedure
for Vapor-Phase Detection of Picric Acid
For the detection
of PA in vapor phase by fluorescent paper strips,
we placed the paper strip over the mouth of the vial containing crystals
of PA for 10 min. The area exposed to the vapors of PA displays quenching
in fluorescence visible to the naked eye. The fluorescence spectra
of the quenched areas of test strips of R1 were recorded
and compared with the emission of respective test strips only adsorbed
with R1.

Calculation of Detection Limit
To
calculate the detection
limit, 0.1 μM concentration of R1 and 1.0 μM
concentration of PA were prepared. Fluorescence titration was carried
out by gradual addition of PA to the solution of R1.
Fluorescence titration showed a linear response up to 2 equiv of PA.
Then, LOD was calculated by the following equation. 1  where K = 2 or 3 (we take
3 in this case); Sb1 is the standard deviation
of the blank solution; and S is the slope of the
calibration curve.

Cell Culture
Monkey kidney epithelial
cells, Vero,
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Gibco, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
NY), antibiotic–antimycotic solution (100 U/mL penicillin,
100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B) (Himedia,
India), and 3.7 g/L bicarbonate and maintained in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Probe R1 Treatment
Cells were seeded in
a 24-well plate and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. The attached
cells were therefore exposed to probe R1 for 1 h. PA
was added to the well and incubated for another 1 h. One well was
set as a negative control, without any treatment, and another well
was set as a positive control where only probe R1 was
added. Cells of control and test groups were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
solution. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out under a Nikon inverted
microscope (Nikon eclipse Tí U, Japan) equipped with 20×
(S Plan Fluor) objective. Cells were excited at 340–380 and
465–495 nm, and fluorescence detection was carried out through
435–485 and 515–555 nm band-pass filters.
