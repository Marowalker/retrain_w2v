A series
of push–pull heterocyclic N,N-diphenylhydrazones were prepared to study the effect of
structural modifications (different π-spacers and electron-withdrawing
groups) on the optical (linear and nonlinear) and electronic properties
of the molecules. The photovoltaic response of dye-sensitized solar
cells assembled using nanocrystalline titania photosensitized with
the synthesized dyes was also studied. These heterocyclic push–pull
conjugated dyes involve N,N-diphenylhydrazones
as electron donors linked to bithiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacers and were functionalized with carboxylic acid,
cyanoacetic acid, or dicyanovinyl acceptor groups. A combination of
Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, Vilsmeier formylation, and condensation
reactions was used to synthesize the intermediates and final products.
Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT calculations
were used to obtain information on conformation, electronic structure,
and electron distribution, both for the free dyes and those adsorbed
on TiO2. The results of this multidisciplinary study indicate
that dyes 5b and 6b have the strongest second-order
nonlinear optical response with hyperpolarizability values in the
range of β = 2330 × 10–30 to 2750 ×
10–30 esu, whereas photovoltaic power conversion
efficiencies reach values in the range of 0.7–3.0% for dyes 5a–b and 7c and were enhanced by coadsorbing
deoxycholic acid (0.8–5.1%).

1 Introduction
Push–pull
heteroaromatic π-conjugated systems are
established compounds in materials science, which combine easy synthesis
with tunability of structures to produce systems with predictable
and unique optoelectronic properties. The molecular arrangement of
these D−π–A systems leads to terminal electron
donor and acceptor group communication through a π-conjugated
bridge. This intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) involves a new low-energy
molecular orbital, accessible through visible light excitation, which
is responsible for the polarization of the molecule.1,2

Optoelectronic properties of these push–pull systems
may
have applications in field-effect transistors,3 light-emitting diodes,4 nonlinear optics
[second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon absorption],5−7 photovoltaics,8−13 and near-infrared absorbing dyes.14

These push–pull systems may be tailored toward specific
applications by changing electron donor or acceptor moieties, spacer
(conjugation length, planarity, and electronic nature), and the overall
chromophore arrangement. An efficient method of tuning the electronic
properties of these systems involves incorporation of heterocyclic
units, which provide high polarizability, thermal and chemical robustness,
and possibilities for further structural changes. In addition, they
can behave as both efficient spacers and auxiliary electron donor/acceptor
groups. A variety of π-bridges and donor and acceptor groups
have been used in the design of heterocyclic push–pull heterocyclic
dyes.1,2

Aromatic hydrazone-based compounds
have been studied in several
areas of materials chemistry, such as organic nonlinear optical (NLO)15−18 and hole-transport materials, and so forth.19,20 These compounds have been of particular interest because of the
easy synthetic access through reaction of carbonyl compounds (particularly
aldehydes) with relatively low-cost starting materials, avoiding expensive
catalysts. They are also tolerant to the presence of water and/or
oxygen. Other interesting characteristics are the extended conjugation
when compared to the corresponding amines, good thermal and chemical
stability, and enhancement of charge mobility through delocalization
of the terminal nitrogen atom lone pair into the π-conjugated
system.16−20

Although application of compounds with a hydrazone moiety
as efficient
electron donors in bulk-heterojunction solar cells has previously
been reported,21−23 few have been studied as sensitizing dyes
for nanocrystalline TiO2 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).24−28 The excellent electronic properties of the thiophene moiety have
led to its widespread application in the design of ICT chromophores.29,30

On the basis of the interesting results reported by us and
other
groups1,2,15−18,24−28 on push–pull heterocyclic π-conjugated
systems for NLO31−41 and photovoltaic applications,42−45 we have synthesized five organic
dyes bearing electron-rich heteroaromatic groups (N,N-diphenylhydrazone and thiophene) as the donor
moiety or/π-spacer and carboxylic, cyanoacetic acid, or dicyanovinyl
moieties as the strong electron-withdrawing/-anchoring groups. Their
optical and redox properties have been evaluated, and they have been
tested in DSSC photovoltaic devices.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
A
series of push–pull heterocyclic chromophores were prepared
to study the effect of different spacers (bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) and electron-withdrawing moieties (carboxylic
acid, cyanoacetic acid, and dicyanovinyl) on their linear and NLO
properties, redox behavior, and potential as sensitizers in DSSCs
based on nanocrystalline titania. All of the compounds bear a N,N-diphenylhydrazone donor unit that was
chosen because of its high charge mobility properties as an electron
donor.25 The thiophene units in the π-spacer
show excellent charge-transfer properties, efficient π-conjugation,
and low geometrical relaxation upon oxidation.29,31−47

The aldehyde precursor 2c was prepared in good
yield (53%) by Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxylic
acid and 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid. Intermediates 3a–b and push–pull chromophore 7c were synthesized
in moderate to good yields (55–72%) through condensation of
the respective aldehydes 2a–c with N,N-diphenylhydrazone 1 in ethanol.
The intermediate aldehydes 4a–b were obtained
(45–58% yields) by Vilsmeier–Haack formylation. Knoevenagel
condensation (piperidine catalyst) in refluxing ethanol of the aldehydes 4a–b with 2-cyanoacetic acid gave the push–pull
chromophores 5a–b in fair to good yields (27–58%),
whereas dyes 6a–b were prepared in fair yields
(22–29%) by condensation of the same aldehydes with malononitrile
(Scheme 1).

Recently, the synthesis of precursor 3a was
reported
by Roncali and collaborators through condensing N,N-diphenylhydrazine with aldehyde 2a, in 63% yield, using different experimental conditions: MeOH/tetrahydrofuran
in the presence of sodium acetate. Aldehyde 4b was also
reported, in 37% yield, using a one-step methodology by condensing N,N-diphenylhydrazine with 5,5′-diformylbithiophene.
The same investigators also published the synthesis of dyes 6a–b using different reaction conditions (NET3 as the base and CHCl3 as the solvent).23

The structures of these compounds were confirmed
by standard procedures
(detailed characterization and Table S1 with experimental data in
the Supporting Information).

2.2 Electrochemical Study
To obtain energies
of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) redox properties of the compounds, 5a–b and 7c were studied using cyclic
voltammetry (CV). In DSSCs, dye N719 is most commonly
used; its band gap energy is appropriate for absorption in the visible
region of the solar spectra; energies of LUMO and HOMO fit well for
electron injection into TiO2 and regeneration of the dye.
Data on the electrochemical behavior of N719 are presented
as a “reference’’. The energies of HOMO and LUMO
of 5a–b and 7c were calculated. The
energy level of ferrocene (4.39 eV) was used as the reference. Table 1 summarizes the data.
For compounds 5 and 7, the redox behavior
is reversible; whatever scan rate of potential is applied, the potentials
of cathodic and anodic peaks of current remain constant. Potentials
for oxidation of compounds 5a, 5b, and 7c are 0.73, 0.67, and 0.64 V, respectively. These potentials
are higher than the potential of the 3I–/I3– couple (0.42 V), which in the case of application
in solar cells, reduces back transfer of electrons to the electrolyte.48,49 The oxidation potential clearly depends on the electronic nature
of the heteroaromatic spacer unit: the stronger the auxiliary electron-donating
ability, the easier it is to oxidize the molecule. The bithiophene
derivative 5b displays the lowest oxidation potential
(highest energy of HOMO), suggesting a slightly stronger electron-donating
ability when compared to compound 5a (this is in accordance
with the UV–vis spectral data). The LUMO level of the dyes
indicates the thermodynamic possibility of the electron injection
into the conduction band of TiO2 such that the LUMO level
of the dye must be higher than that of the conduction band. Compound 5b shows the lower LUMO level of all studied dyes (−2.65
eV), indicating the lowest thermodynamic driving force for electron
injection. Compound 7c exhibits the highest band gap
among the compounds studied (2.92 eV), indicating that its photoexcitation
is less efficient at long wavelengths—excitation requires higher
energies. Even though the HOMO level is similar to that of compound 5b, the LUMO level is much higher, which could be ascribed
to the lower ability for electron capture by the carboxylic group
present in 7c when compared to the cyanoacetic moiety
in 5b.

2.3 Optical Studies
2.3.1 Linear Optical Properties
The absorption
and emission spectra of heterocyclic compounds 3–7 were studied in ethanol, at room temperature. Table 2 summarizes the data, whereas Figure 1 displays the spectra of chromophores 4–7. All of the push–pull chromophores studied
exhibit at least one strong broad absorption band between 416 and
456 nm that is assigned to an ICT between the electron donor and acceptor
groups. The peak of these absorption bands varies according to the
spacer and electron-withdrawing moieties employed. The substitution
of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene for the bithiophene moiety
as the spacer induces a bathochromic shift in the longest wavelength
absorption (Δλ = 5 nm for compounds 3, Δλ
= 30 nm for compounds 4, Δλ = 21 nm for compounds 5, and Δλ = 25 nm for compounds 6) that is explained by the slight increase of the π-conjugation
path and the enhanced auxiliary donor effect of bithiophene. Shifts
of the absorption maxima are also observed when comparing the acceptor
groups; generally, the higher the conjugation length and electron-withdrawing
ability, the longer is the wavelength of maximum of absorption. For
compounds 3 and 4, the introduction of a
formyl group leads to bathochromic shifts in the range of 42–67
nm. Comparing compounds 4 and 5, the substitution
of the formyl group for the 2-cyanoacetic acid moiety induces another
bathochromic shift of 16–25 nm because of the stronger acceptor
characteristics of the cyanoacetic group as well as the increase of
conjugation. Comparison of compounds 4a–b and 6a–b shows that the dicyanovinyl group causes bathochromic
shifts around 8–13 nm. Moreover, a hypsochromic shift of 24
nm is observed on comparing absorption spectra of compounds 4b and 7c because of the substitution of the
electron-withdrawing formyl group by a carboxylic acid group. This
result was not expected, bearing in mind the lower conjugation of
the aldehyde compared to the carboxylic acid moiety. The novel cyanoacetic
chromophores 5a–b have high molar extinction coefficients
(20 141–30 740 M–1 cm–1) compared to the dicyanovinyl derivatives 6a–b (19 221–26 766 M–1 cm–1). Exciting compounds 3–7 at the
maximum absorption wavelength, their emission spectra were recorded
under room-temperature conditions (Figure 1, Table 2). The fluorescence was significantly influenced by
the nature of the spacer and acceptor groups; generally, an increase
in the extent of the π-conjugated system or functionalization
with stronger electron donor or acceptor groups shifts the spectra
to longer wavelengths. With the exception of compound 3b (ΦF = 0.20), all heterocyclic systems showed very
weak emissive properties, with relative fluorescence quantum yields
ranging from 0.01 to 0.03. When a nitrogen heteroatom is involved
in the π-system, the n → π* transition may be the
lowest lying transition and is characterized by a radiative lifetime
at least 100 times longer than that of low lying π →
π* transitions. Under these conditions, nonradiative processes
are dominant, leading to low fluorescence quantum yields of many azo
compounds as well as some compounds containing carbonyl groups and
nitrogen heterocycles. As expected, a red shift of the emission of
the compounds is observed upon increasing the strength of the acceptor
group (aldehyde < carboxylic acid < cyanoacetic acid < dicyanovinyl).
Thienothiophenes 4a, 5a, and 6a show emissions at 480, 519, and 564 nm, respectively, whereas bithiophenes 4b, 5b, 6b, and 7c exhibit
emissions at 536, 574, 591, and 501 nm, respectively. A bathochromic
shift is also observed upon increasing the π-conjugation path
length though the bithiophene spacer, comparing compound 4a with 4b (7 nm), compound 5a with 5b (52 nm), and compound 6a with 6b (18 nm). All of the studied push–pull systems show large
Stokes’ shifts (3557–5910 cm–1), indicating
that significant structure relaxation occurs in the excited state
upon absorption. Moreover, the compounds functionalized with stronger
electron-withdrawing cyanoacetic acid and dicyanovinyl moieties 5–6 exhibit larger Stokes’ shifts than the corresponding
aldehyde precursors 4. This is consistent with the possibility
of increased ICT upon absorption, particularly in the case of the
dicyanovinyl moieties for which the Stokes shift increase is greater
than 50%.

2.3.2 NLO Properties
Hyper-Rayleigh scattering50,51 (HRS) was used to characterize
the molecular first hyperpolarizabilities
β of push–pull N,N-diphenylhydrazone
derivatives 5–7. The incident laser beam had a
fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm, and the chromophores were dissolved
in dioxane. The mean hyperpolarizability values, β, were determined
by comparison with a p-nitroaniline (pNA) reference solution.52,53 The extent that the second harmonic signal might be contaminated
by multiphoton-induced fluorescence was taken into account by measuring
the HRS signal over different spectral bandwidths (see Supporting Information for more details). The
static hyperpolarizabilities β0 were estimated via
a simple two-level model neglecting damping.54−56 Both an increase
in the π-conjugation of the spacer and an intensification of
the electronic acceptor ability of the withdrawing group clearly influence
the nonlinearities of compounds 4–7 as quantified
in Table 3. First,
the measured β values show that the bithiophene spacer leads
to higher molecular hyperpolarizability values than the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moiety. Therefore, aldehyde 4b has
a higher β value (β = 290 × 10–30 esu) than 4a (β = 205 × 10–30 esu), as does cyanoacetic acid 5b (β = 2330 ×
10–30 esu) when compared to 5a (β
= 930 × 10–30 esu) and dicyanovinyl derivative 6b (β = 2750 × 10–30 esu) in
comparison with 6a (β = 265 × 10–30 esu). The static hyperpolarizability β0 values
of the compounds follow the same trend. The more extensive π-conjugation
and stronger auxiliary electron-donating ability of the bithiophene
moiety are probably the main reasons for these trends. We also notice
a general increase of the hyperpolarizability β as the electron-accepting
ability is increased and as the electronic conjugation of the acceptor
end moiety becomes larger. In the case of compounds bearing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (4a, 5a, and 6a), the SHG response is enhanced by an increase of the acceptor
group strength upon changing the aldehyde group (β = 205 ×
10–30 esu for 4a) to a dicyanovinyl
group (β = 265 × 10–30 esu for 6a) and then for a cyanoacetic acid moiety (β = 930
× 10–30 esu for 5a). A similar
tendency is observed in compounds bearing bithiophene as the spacer
(4b, 5b, 6b, and 7c). Derivative 4b shows the lowest hyperpolarizability
β, followed by the carboxylic acid 7c. Chromophores 5b and 6b exhibit the highest values of β
(2330 × 10–30 esu for 5b and 2750
× 10–30 esu for 6b); however,
in this case, the dicyanovinyl derivative 6b has higher
SHG response than the cyanoacetic derivative 5b. The
lower hyperpolarizability β value of 5b might be
a result of the distorted conformation of the π-system due not
only to the bithiophene spacer but also the cyanoacetic acid moiety
when compared to the dicyanovinyl group. This could result in a suppression
of electron transfer, even though the dominant conformer is planar
between the spacer and acceptor moieties.43 This result is in accordance with the electrochemical study of dyes 6, previously reported by Roncali et al.,23 where we noticed that the LUMO levels in dyes 6 do not follow the same trend as in dyes 5: the introduction
of the bithiophene spacer in dye 6b leads to a destabilization
of the LUMO (−3.45 eV for 6a and −3.39
eV for 6b), which is expected because of the stronger
donating ability of the auxiliary electron, whereas in dye 5b, the opposite occurs. The static hyperpolarisability β0 values for the compounds show the same trend.

2.4 Performance
in DSSCs
Recently, several
groups have reported that photovoltaic efficiencies ranged from 3.30
to 7.74% for organic hydrazine dyes bearing different π-spacers/electron
donor groups (thiophene, pyrrole, furan, triphenylamino, and tetrahydroquinoline)
and functionalized with various anchoring moieties (cyanoacetic acid
and rhodanine acetic acid).24−28 Therefore, we decided to expand these earlier studies as well as
our work concerning organic sensitizers bearing bithiophene and thienothiophene
spacers42−45 to the synthesis of the novel bithiophene and thienothiophene dyes 5a–b and 7c to be evaluated as sensitizers
for DSSCs.

Performance metrics of the DSSCs (efficiency—η,
filling factor—FF, max. power point—MPP, voltage at
open circuit—VOC, current density
at short-circuit—JSC) sensitized
with dyes 5a–b and 7c and N719 reference dye, as well as the results from the coadsorption with
deoxycholic acid (DCA) are presented in Table 4. The current–voltage characteristics
of the prepared DSSCs are presented in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) and Figure 2 and show shapes typical for photodiodes
for all of the cells. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) spectra are presented in Figure 3.

Figure 2 Current–voltage characteristics recorded under
illumination
and in the dark for the DSSCs assembled using synthesized dyes 5a–b and 7c (dashed lines) and with the
DCA coadsorbent molecule.

and with 50 mM DCA as an additive for coadsorption (solid lines).

N719	0.74	16.11	8.51	0.72	9.25	
The DSSC prepared using N,N-diphenylhydrazone
dye 7c exhibits the lowest efficiency (0.72%). The very
low JSC (2.01 mA cm–2) could be related to the low extinction coefficient (12562 M–1 cm–1), narrow absorbance spectrum,
and high electronic band gap (2.92 eV) exhibited by this dye. The
IPCE spectra of the DSSC with 7c dye supports these assumptions;
only the higher energy photons from the spectral region 350–450
nm are able to turn the dye to its photoexcited state and contribute
to photocurrent. However, this could turn to the advantage of this
dye for “greenhouse” concept, where high transparency
of the integrated photovoltaic device is eventually important.

DSSCs prepared using dyes 5a–b show very similar
photovoltaic efficiencies: 2.98% for 5a and 3.01% for 5b. The slightly higher efficiency of the DSSC sensitized
with 5b dye (about 33% of the efficiency of the DSSC
with N719 dye), bearing a bithiophene moiety as the π-spacer/auxiliary
electron donor, results from the enhanced JSC (6.77 mA cm–2) that could be due to the longer
π-conjugation of the sensitizing dye and lower electronic band
gap when compared to dye 5a.

To enhance the efficiency
of the DSSCs sensitized with dyes 5a–b and 7c, we used coadsorption with
DCA. Bile acids such as DCA and chenodeoxycholic acid are able to
improve the efficiency of the cells because of the reduction of dye
aggregation on the surface of TiO2, suppressing dark current
and improving electron lifetime.25,57

The
photovoltaic response of the cells with dyes 5a and 7c was increased slightly by the addition of DCA
as the coadsorbent (from 2.98 to 3.22% for dye 5a and
from 0.72 to 0.79% for dye 7c), whereas the efficiency
of the cell with dye 5b improved significantly—from
3.01 to 5.10%. It can be seen from Table 4 and Figure 2 that the addition of DCA does not affect VOC of the cells based on dyes 5a and 7c—the variations are within the statistical deviation.
The slight enhancement of the performance of these cells is due to
the improvement of the FF via suppressing the dark current. At the
same time, for dye 5b, coadsorption of DCA leads to noticeable
increase of VOC.

It is noteworthy
that the addition of DCA to the sensitization
solutions causes perceptible bathochromic shifts in the transmittance
and absorption spectra for dyes 5a–b (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Transmittance (a) and
absorbance (b) spectra for the ethanol solutions
(0.5 mM) of the synthesized dyes 5a–b and 7c (dashed lines) and with the addition of 50 mM of DCA (solid
lines).

This bathochromic shift is accompanied
by a slight increase of
the quantum yield above 500 nm for the cell based on dye 5a. Noteworthy, a pronounced improvement of quantum yield above 550
nm for the cell based on dye 5b was observed (Figure 4). The overall performance
of the DSSC with dye 5b coadsorbed with DCA was found
to be 5.01%, which is promising for metal-free organic dyes.

2.5 Computational Studies
The metal-free
organic sensitizers 5a–b and 7c considered
in our study have many possible conformations. Different conformers
can have very different degrees of conjugation; therefore, it is important
to determine the lowest energy conformers responsible for the observed
absorption spectra of the dyes. For dyes 5a and 5b, 12 conformers were considered in each case, differing
in the relative arrangements of the carboxylic acid, cyano, bithiophene
(or thienothiophene), and N,N-diphenylhydrazone
groups. For dye 7c, we investigated the structures and
energies of four different conformers. For dyes 5b and 7c, a simplification was introduced by considering only the
thiophene–thiophene trans conformers. This is justified in
view of previous studies,43,58 which showed that the
cis conformation usually accounts for ca. 10% of the population of
conformers in this type of structures. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the most stable conformers of
these dyes and their relative energies calculated at the density functional
theory (DFT) level. The energy differences found for these forms indicate
a population of about 58% for conformer 5a-I, 77% for
conformer 5b-I, and 53% for conformer 7c-I. Because these are the dominant conformers, our subsequent analysis
will be carried out for these forms, and for simplicity, we will refer
to conformers 5a-I, 5b-I, and 7c-I as dyes 5a, 5b, and 7c, respectively.

Figure 5 presents
the structures of the dominant conformers. In the three dyes, the
cyano and the carboxylic groups are coplanar with the thienothiophene
(in 5a) or bithiophene (in 5b and 7c) π-bridges, showing strong conjugation between the
π-orbitals of these groups. This is convenient because it will
improve the efficiency of electron transfer from the bridge to the
electron acceptor. Dye 7c is slightly distorted in the
region between the donor and the π-bridge.

Figure 6 shows
the
DFT-calculated energies for the frontier molecular orbitals of the
three dyes. The larger extension of the conjugation in the chain in 5b leads to a smaller band gap for this dye. Dye 7c has the smallest conjugated chain, and for this reason, it has the
highest band gap of the three dyes considered. This leads to a red
shift of the first band in the absorption spectra of 5b and a blue shift of the first band in the spectra of 7c, compared with 5a. The LUMO levels are significantly
lower for 5a and 5b, compared with 7c, in agreement with the cyanoacetic group being a better
electron acceptor than the carboxylic one. The LUMO levels are above Ec of titania (−4.0 eV vs vacuum),59 and the levels of HOMO are below the redox potential
of 3I–/I3– (−4.6
eV vs vacuum).60 For utilizing in DSSCs,
this means that the necessary driving force is provided for electron
injection into the semiconductor and the regeneration of the dyes
by the electrolyte. The data acquired from CV are provided in Figure 6 (green solid lines).
One can see that HOMO and LUMO energies match very well the experimental
CV values.

B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory for the dyes 5a, 5b, and 7c. The experimental values extracted
from CV are marked with the green solid lines. The magenta dashed
line points to the energy of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.0 eV for anatase), and the gray dashed line indicates
the 3I–/I3– redox potential
(−4.6 eV). LUMO and HOMO are indicated as “L”
and “H”, respectively.

The UV–vis absorption spectra (vertical electronic
excitations)
were calculated for the free dyes at the time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT)/CAM-B3LYP
level, and the main contributions to the transitions with maximum
absorption involve the HOMO – 1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO + 1 orbitals
(Figure 7 and Table 5). For 5a, the maximum absorption transition has a computed wavelength of
446 nm (experimental value 435 nm in ethanol) and corresponds predominantly
to a HOMO → LUMO excitation (85%) with small contributions
from HOMO – 1 → LUMO (8%) and HOMO → LUMO + 1
(3%) configurations. The maximum absorption of 5b (calculated
value is 470 nm and experimental value in ethanol is 456 nm) is red-shifted
relatively to 5a, as discussed above, and the dominant
contributions to this transition are the HOMO → LUMO (79%),
HOMO – 1 → LUMO (14%), and HOMO → LUMO + 1 (5%)
excitations. Dye 7c has its maximum absorption blue-shifted
relative to 5a and 5b. The calculated maximum
appears at 399 nm (in ethanol solvent, the experimental value is 416
nm), and as with dyes 5a and 5b, the main
contribution is a HOMO → LUMO excitation (86%). From Figure 7, one can see the
type of the orbitals involved in these transitions. The HOMOs are
π orbitals, mainly localized on the donor and the thienothiophene
(in 5a) or bithiophene (in 5b and 7c) π-bridges, whereas the LUMOs are π* orbitals
essentially on the acceptor group and on the π-bridges. The
HOMO – 1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO + 1 excitations
tend to decrease the charge separation between the ground and excited
states in these dyes; however, their contributions to the transition
are very small. Therefore, there is efficient charge transfer between
the donor and the acceptor upon excitation.

Adsorption
of the dye on TiO2 causes a reorganization
of the electronic states of the semiconductor.61−63 This can affect
the electronic absorption spectra of the dyes and also the efficiency
of injection of electrons into TiO2. It is, therefore,
important to evaluate the effect of adsorption of the dyes on their
structural and electronic properties at the interface. Because of
computational limitations, we only carried out this analysis for the
dye 5a adsorbed on TiO2. Two types of approaches
have been used to model the dye···TiO2 interface.
One is based on the simulation of the dye adsorbed to an infinitely
large particle of TiO2, in one or multiple dimensions,
employing a periodic condition and using plane-wave basis sets. The
second approach considers the dye adsorbed to an isolated cluster
of (TiO2)n and the calculations
use a localized basis set.61−68 Both methods present advantages, and in our study, we have used
the second one. The size of the cluster, (TiO2)9, and the bidentate mode of adsorption in which the dye is covalently
linked to a Ti atom of the cluster through the two oxygen atoms of
the anchoring carboxylic group were also chosen based on the literature.62,64,69,70 To keep electroneutrality of the system, the hydrogen atom coming
from deprotonation71 of the anchoring carboxylic
group was linked to a cluster oxygen atom.62,66 The geometry of the 5a/TiO2 system was optimized
at the DFT level; the effect of dye adsorption on the energy levels
of the orbitals is presented in Figure 8. The LUMO and the next virtual orbitals in the combined 5a/TiO2 system are stabilized relative to the same
orbitals of the free dye. This is a consequence of the introduction
of additional electronic states by the semiconductor. The HOMO and
the next occupied orbitals are also slightly stabilized. Interestingly,
however, there is no shift in the absorption maximum of the dye in
the combined system, as we can see from Table 5. For the dye 5a adsorbed to
(TiO2)9, TD-DFT calculations estimate an absorption
maximum at 446 nm, the same value as for the free dye. The maximum
absorption transition in the combined 5a/TiO2 system has now significantly different contributions. Two dominant
contributions come from the HOMO → LUMO (37%) and HOMO →
LUMO + 3 (36%) excitations, together with minor contributions from
HOMO → LUMO + 1 (4%), HOMO – 1 → LUMO (4%), HOMO
→ LUMO + 4 (4%), HOMO → LUMO + 6 (4%), and HOMO –
1 → LUMO + 3 (3%).

Figure 8 Energy of selected molecular orbitals calculated
at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level of theory for the (TiO2)9 cluster and
the dye 5a adsorbed on (TiO2)9.
The dashed line (magenta) points to the level of the conduction band
edge of TiO2 (−4.0 eV for anatase), and the gray
dashed line indicates the 3I–/I3– potential (4.6 eV). “L” and “H”
stand for LUMO and HOMO, respectively.

It should be noted that these energy gaps are different in
the
two systems. Smaller contributions come also from excitations with
larger energy gaps, such as HOMO → LUMO + 25, HOMO →
LUMO + 26, HOMO → LUMO + 27, and so forth, which are absent
in the case of the free dye. The sum of all of these contributions
in the case of 5a/TiO2 gives a resulting vertical
excitation energy which is similar to one of the free dye.

Although
their energy suffers slight changes, the HOMO and HOMO
– 1 in the combined 5a/TiO2 system
(Figure 9) are essentially
equivalent to these orbitals in the free dye. In contrast, the LUMO
and the remaining virtual orbitals involved in the maximum absorption
transition are localized predominantly on the cluster. The LUMO +
3, LUMO + 4, and LUMO + 6 also extend to the acceptor and π-bridge.
The distribution of electron density in these orbitals shows that
there will be efficient electron injection from the excited dye into
TiO2 in a DSSC.

selected molecular orbitals of dye 5a adsorbed on (TiO2)9 calculated at
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.

To discuss further the relation between the performance of
the
chromophores as sensitizers for TiO2 DSSCs and their second-order
NLO response, we focus on a comparison between compounds 5a and 5b. These chromophores differ only in their π-electron
bridge and should have similar coupling efficiencies for electron
transfer to the TiO2 substrate. Given the tendency of many
D−π–A molecules to form π-stacked aggregates
on the surface of TiO2 clusters, which will encourage the
back transfer of electrons and, consequently, decrease DSSC efficiency,
we further restrict our attention to the measurements using the coabsorber
DCA, known for its ability to dissociate π-aggregates. The ratio
of the efficiency of the 5b + DCA DSSC to that of the 5a–DCA DSSC is 5.10%:3.22% ≈ 1.6, roughly equal
to the ratio of the extrapolated hyperpolarizabilities, 300:180 ≈
1.7. Interestingly, the DFT-estimated oscillator strengths of the
first singlet transition listed in Table 5 indicate that chromophore 5a has a stronger dipole optical transition moment than chromophore 5b. This suggests that the asymmetry in the optical field-induced
polarizability of chromophore 5b is greater, which might
facilitate the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the donor to
the substrate. We note that the DFT study carried out on chromophore 5a coupled to a TiO2 cluster indicated that because
of the interaction between the chromophore and the substrate, the
character of the first singlet transition changed; a substantial mixing
of the LUMO + 3 state was accompanied by a strong reduction in the
participation of the LUMO state (see Table 5). As the electron density of LUMO + 3 extends
far into the π-bridge, this could result in less efficient electron
collection by the substrate. The existence of a stronger charge-transfer
asymmetry in chromophore 5b might counteract this delocalization
of the electron density from the TiO2 cluster, promoting
higher DSSC efficiencies.

3 Conclusions
N,N-Diphenylhydrazone derivatives 3–7 were obtained in fair to good yields, using commercially
available precursors and simple, convenient synthetic and purification
procedures. Condensation of aldehydes 2a–c with N,N-diphenylhydrazine gave intermediates 3a–b and 7c. Further functionalization
of precursors 3a–b through Vilsmeier formylation
allowed the preparation of formyl derivatives 4a–b that, through Knoevenagel condensation, gave the push–pull
compounds 5–6.

Experimental and theoretical
characterization of the absorption,
fluorescence, and NLO and electrochemical properties of the systems
were carried out as a means to evaluate their potential as photosensitizers
for nanocrystalline TiO2-based DSSCs. The effect of different
π-spacers and acceptor groups was evaluated. These comparative
studies demonstrate that the incorporation the bithiophene π-bridge
enhances the electron donor effect when compared with thienothiophene
and that the dicyanovinyl acceptor group, although less conjugated
than cyanoacetic acid and a weaker electron-withdrawing moiety, induces
less distortion to the heterocyclic system, which can be advantageous.

Chromophores 5b and 6b exhibit the highest
hyperpolarizability β (2330 × 10–30 esu
for 5b, 2750 × 10–30 esu for 6b). The lower hyperpolarizability β value of 5b, which is the more strongly conjugated system, could be
attributed to the distorted conformation of the π-system due
not only to the bithiophene spacer but also to the cyanoacetic acid
moiety.

Compound 5b, bearing a bithiophene π-spacer,
exhibits the best conversion efficiency (3.01%) when used as a sensitizer
for nanocrystalline titania in DSSCs because of the lower electronic
band gap and longer π-conjugation of the sensitizing dye. Studies
of coadsorption were performed by adding DCA to the sensitizing mixtures,
revealing slight improvements for the cells based on dyes 5a and 7c, whereas the efficiency of the DSSCs with dye 5b was significantly enhanced from 3.01 to 5.10%. This improvement
originated from the bathochromic shift of the adsorption spectra of
the dye 5b in the presence of DCA and consequential widening
of the spectral response of the photocurrent quantum yield.

Further optimization of the molecular structure of all chromophores
should lead to enhanced hyperpolarizabilities and photovoltaic efficiencies.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
N,N-Diphenylhydrazine hydrochloride,
5-bromothiophene-2-carboxylic
acid, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde, 2,2′-bithiophene-5-carboxaldehyde,
phosphorous oxychloride, malononitrile, and 2-cyanoacetic acid were
obtained from Aldrich, whereas 5-formylthiopheneboronic acid was obtained
from Acros Organics. All commercial reagents and solvents were used
without further purification. The progress of the reaction was checked
by means of thin-layer chromatography on 0.25 mm thick precoated silica
plates (Merck Fertigplatten Kieselgel 60 F254); the spots were visualized
using UV light. Silica gel column chromatography (Merck Kieselgel,
230–400 mesh) was used in the purification of the compounds.
NMR spectra were performed on a Bruker Avance II 400 (working frequency
of 400 MHz for 1H and 100.6 MHz for 13C), and
the solvent peak was used as the internal reference. The solvents
are specified in parenthesis before the chemical shifts values (δ
relative to tetramethylsilane). Peak assignments were obtained by
comparison of chemical shifts, peak multiplicities, and J values and were sustained by spin decoupling-double resonance and
bidimensional heteronuclear multiple bond correlation and heteronuclear
multiple quantum coherence techniques. Infrared spectra were obtained
on a Bomem MB 104 spectrophotometer. UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded with a Shimadzu UV/2501PC spectrophotometer. Fluorescence
spectra were obtained with a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer, and relative
fluorescence quantum yields were determined using the reference standard
fluorescein in 0.1 M aqueous solution of NaOH (ΦF = 0.79)72 or 9,10-diphenylanthracene
in ethanol.73 Melting points were determined
on a Gallenkamp machine. Mass spectra analysis was performed at the
C.A.C.T.I.—Unidad de Espectrometria de Masas of the University
of Vigo, Spain. The experimental procedures for the synthesis of precursor 2, N,N-diphenylhidrazone
derivatives 3a–b, 7c, aldehydes 4a–b, the final push–pull cyanoacetic acid 5a–b, and dicyanovinyl derivatives 6a–b are described in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Cyclic Voltammetry
Autolab PGSTAT302N
was used for electrochemical measurements. The measurements were performed
in a three-electrode cell. Glassy carbon served as the working electrode,
Pt was as the counter-electrode, and the reference was Ag/AgCl. Solutions
were prepared using dry dimethylformamide (DMF). Concentrations of
the dyes were 1 mM. [NBu4][BF4] (0.1 M) was
added to achieve sufficient conductivity. All solutions were deaerated
by bubbling of N2. As an internal redox reference, Fc+/Fc was used.42,74

4.3 NLO Measurements
The orientationally
averaged first hyperpolarizability β of the push–pull
chromophores 4–7 was characterized by measuring
the intensity of HRS provoked by incident q-switched laser pulses
with a pulse duration of approximately 12 ns and an energy of 2 mJ.
The experimental setup has been previously described31,38 and is based on the pioneering work of Clays and Persoons,50 (see Supporting Information for further details).

4.4 Preparation and Characterization
of DSSCs
DSSCss were prepared as described in the Supporting Information. The photovoltaic performance was obtained with
an Oriel Class solar simulator and a ZENNIUM workstation, using a
metal mask with an aperture area of 0.25 cm2, as previously
reported.42 (See Supporting Information for further details).

4.5 Computational
Studies
DFT calculations
were used to obtain the geometries and optoelectronic properties of
the dyes 5a, 5b, and 7c. The
geometries of the free dyes were optimized with the B3LYP exchange
correlation functional (combination of the hybrid exchange functional
of Becke75 together with the correlation
functional LYP76), using the all-electron
6-31G(d,p) double-ζ plus polarization basis sets for all atoms.
No symmetry constrains were imposed and the polarizable continuum
model77,78 was used to account for the effects of chloroform
as the bulk solvent. The molecular structures of the most stable conformers
of the dyes were also optimized with the CAM-B3LYP79 functional. The harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated
to assess the nature of the optimized stationary points found in the
potential energy surface and all were confirmed to be true minima
(i.e., with no imaginary frequencies). The properties of the dye 5a adsorbed to a (TiO2)9 cluster were
also calculated. The initial geometry for the (TiO2)9 cluster was obtained from previous theoretical studies.80,81 This structure was then optimized using the B3LYP functional and
the Los Alamos effective core potential plus double-ζ basis
set (LANL2DZ)82−84 on titanium and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for oxygen.
The same computational procedure was used to optimize the geometry
of the dye/TiO2 combined system. TD-DFT calculations were
carried out to analyze the absorption spectral properties of the free
dyes and of the dye/TiO2 system and also to calculate the
vertical excitation energies for the lowest singlet excited states
of the systems. The CAM-B3LYP79 functional
and the 6-311G(d,p) triple-ζ plus polarization basis sets were
used in these calculations. The bulk solvent effects of chloroform
were also considered in the TD-DFT calculations. All calculations
were carried out using the GAMESS-US code.85
