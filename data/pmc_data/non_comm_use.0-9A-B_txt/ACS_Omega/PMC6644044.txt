For
the first time, the influences of two inevitable processing
fields (pressure and flow fields) on the crystallization of a semirigid
molecular chain polymer, that is, poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA),
were explored using a homemade pressuring and shearing device. The
results reveal that the shear rate facilitated the generation of precursor
because it induced oriented segment formation. It was found that the
most sensitive shear temperature for the generation of PLLA precursor
under 100 MPa was 180 °C. When the shear temperature was higher
(e.g., 190 °C), the relaxation of shear-induced oriented segments
was too quick to induce the generation of PLLA precursor. Oppositely,
at a lower shear temperature (170 °C), the oriented segments
were hard to relax within the whole shear rate range (3.1–31.4
s–1). Annealing treatment was infaust to the PLLA
precursor formation because it promoted the relaxation of oriented
segments. Different from the shear and annealing, pressure played
a more complicated role in the formation of PLLA precursor. Pressure
decreased the free volume between PLLA molecular chains and meantime
increased the supercooling of PLLA melt. In addition, PLLA chains
tended to form locally oriented segment bundles to adapt to the pressurized
state, which facilitated the formation of PLLA precursor and the following
crystallization process. These two factors lowered the movability
of PLLA chains and suppressed the relaxation of chain, so shear-induced
orientation facilitated PLLA precursor formation under pressure. In
that case, pressure and shear flow showed a synergetic promoting effect
on the generation of PLLA precursor and the following crystallization
process. These meaningful results could be helpful for comprehending
the relationship between crystallization conditions and the crystallization
behavior of PLLA and thus would provide guidance to fabricating the
final products through controlling the crystallization process of
PLLA.

1 Introduction
Flow
fields, which exist in almost all processing methods, such
as extrusion, injection, and spinning, dramatically influence the
crystallization rate1,2 and crystalline structure of polymers3−5 and hence their mechanical properties.6−10 Therefore, understanding flow-induced crystallization (FIC) of polymers
is of importance to tailoring the structure and properties of polymers.
However, there still exist some fundamental issues of FIC, such as
the process of generating precursors,11−13 because the precursors
during crystallization are difficult to detect. This has been arousing
great interest of many scholars to research precursor formation in
FIC for a long time.3,11−33 During the polymer crystallization process with shear flow introduced
in, precursor, an ordered structure between polymer melt and crystal,
generates,34 which acts as crystal nucleus
and affects the following crystallization process.15 Confined by measurement technologies, precursors cannot
be observed directly until Peters et al. found the signals of precursor
by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD).11,28 In the last
few years, the quick progress in synchrotron radiation X-ray technologies
has been accelerating the study on the precursors induced by flow,
although it is still incapable of giving specific data for the oriented
segments (the primary unit of precursor).

In 1967, Katayama
et al.14 studied the
structure evolution during the spin process of polyethylene (PE) and
found that there existed density fluctuation on X-ray signal before
generating ordered crystal structure. Alfonso et al.15−18 have done much work on polymer precursors [polypropylene (PP), polystyrene
(PS), and polybutene (PB)]. They found that precursors could exist
for several hours at a temperature above the melting points. Meanwhile,
long polymer chains are helpful for increasing the relaxation time
of precursor.35 Hsiao et al.19−23 testified that shishlike precursors could exist as amorphous phase,
mesophase, or crystals and were generated at the earlier stage of
crystallization. Peters et al.11,24−28 proposed that the stability of precursor depended on its size. A
precursor could become stabilized and transform to shish only when
its size was beyond a critical size. Otherwise, the precursor tended
to melt because of its nature of instability. Kanaya et al.29,30 found that the random molecular chains of atactic PS were helpful
for the generation of isotactic PS precursor under shear conditions
with the aid of synchrotron radiation and optical microscopy. The
results of Li et al.12 showed that fiber
stretching induced precursor formation in isotactic polypropylene
(iPP) and the crystallization ability of iPP depended on the stretching
temperature. Moreover, they proposed that the pre-order structure
was related to intramolecular conformational ordering, intermolecular
orientation, and liquid order structure.13,31,32

The above-mentioned experimental results
show that the previous
studies on precursor were focused on polymers with flexible chains,
such as PE, PP, and PB, or on polymers with rigid molecular chains,
such as PS. It is a pity that no study on precursor of semirigid polymers
was carried out. As known to all, semirigid chains are the molecular
chains with a rigidity between flexible and rigid chains and therefore
possess a crystallization capacity between rigid and flexible chains.
Undoubtedly, research on precursor formation of semirigid polymers
is important because it can widen the FIC knowledge of polymer. As
one of the semirigid polymers, poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA)
has attracted extensive attention because of its environmental friendliness,36−39 good biocompatibility,40 thermal stability,41 and mechanical property10,42 and therefore is widely used in packaging, textile, issue engineering,
and so on.38−40,43−48 In that case, studies on PLLA precursor and its effect on the following
crystallization is of great importance.

Another thing that deserves
to be mentioned is that, limited by
experimental devices, the previous studies on precursor were carried
out under flow fields solely.11−13,15−21,23,24,26,28,31,32 However, there also
exists pressure in practical polymer processing.3,49−51 For example, the pressure is up to hundreds of megapascal
(MPa) during injection,3 extrusion,52 and so on. Therefore, to study flow-induced
precursor formation and its stability under pressure is of practical
significance. The results can be used to guide real-polymer processing.
In view of that the major reason of no much research on flow-induced
precursor of polymers under pressure27,53 is due to
the experiment device limitation, our group designed a pressure and
shear device (PSD), which has many advantages including a linear distribution
of shear rate along the radius of disk sample. With the aid of PSD,
many fascinating phenomena were observed,2,33,49−51,53−55 which are different from those obtained under only
flow (without pressure). Therefore, making use of this device can
simulate practical processing and investigate its crystallization
process. More importantly, it is the first time that the precursor
of semirigid polymer was studied under the coexistence of pressure
and shear conditions.

In this work, PSD was utilized to explore
the shear temperature
(Ts) and annealing time (ta) dependency of PLLA precursor under the coexistence
of pressure and shear. The effects of pressure (Pc), Ts, and ta on PLLA precursor were investigated via calculating
the crystallinity and crystal structure of PLLA. Some interesting
results were obtained through this work. (I) Ts affected the final crystallinity and crystal morphology of
PLLA via influencing the relaxation rate of precursor. In addition,
shear rate (γ̇) also affected the final crystallinity
of sample through influencing the orientation of chains and number
of precursors. (II) When shear flow was applied at the same Ts, the crystallinity and crystal morphology
of PLLA were influenced by ta, depending
on the relaxation behavior of precursor. (III) The final crystallinity
of the sample prepared under a high Pc was higher than that under a low Pc because
the relaxation of precursor was slowed down by the high Pc. We investigated the effect of shear under pressure
on the formation of PLLA precursor for the first time. All these results
can help understanding the FIC behavior of PLLA under pressure and
even provide important guidance in practical processing.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Results
2.1.1 Effects of Shear Temperature on PLLA Precursors
To
explore the influences of shear temperature on PLLA precursors,
WAXD was employed to characterize the crystalline structure of samples
PLLA-170-0, PLLA-180-0, and PLLA-190-0. Figure 1 presents the two-dimensional WAXD (2D-WAXD)
patterns and one-dimensional WAXD (1D-WAXD) profiles of sample PLLA-180-0
as a function of shear rate. The 2D-WAXD patterns show a series of
Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings, among which the strongest
two were (200, 110)α and (203)α reflections,
suggesting the formation of isotropic α-crystal. It was inferred
that the crystals generated under this experimental condition were
spherulites without orientation, which was verified by the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) results (Figure S4). In addition, in the corresponding 1D-WAXD profiles, four diffraction
peaks56,57 at 2θ = 14.9°, 16.7°, 19.1°,
and 22.3°, assigned to (010)α, (200/110)α, (203)α, and (015)α, respectively, became stronger with the shear rate increasing, indicative
of an increase in PLLA crystallinity. Compared to PLLA-170-0 (Figure S1), the diffraction intensity of α-crystal
of sample PLLA-180-0 was weaker at the same shear rate. When the shear
temperature was elevated to 190 °C, as shown in Figure S2, the diffraction ring and peak intensities of α-crystal
declined further. This significant decrease in intensity with shear
temperature represented a reduction in the crystallinity of PLLA.
From these results, a reasonable conclusion can be drawn that a too
high shear temperature is adverse for PLLA crystallization under the
present condition, that is, applying shear at 170–190 °C
before isothermal crystallization at 160 °C.

Figure 1 2D-WAXD patterns and
1D-WAXD profiles for sample PLLA-180-0.

The quantitative results for the crystallinity variation
of samples
sheared at different temperatures were plotted against shear rate
in Figure 2. Note that
the crystallinity of PLLA was extremely low (approaching zero), under
the condition without preshearing, indicating that static condition
was adverse for PLLA crystallization. Considering that static condition
was not the protagonist in this work, we did not list the results
of static condition in Figure 2. After the sample was sheared at 180 °C, its crystallinity
increased with the increase in shear rate from 3.1 to 31.4 s–1.34,57 When the shear temperature decreased to
170 °C, the relaxation rate of oriented segments reduced, and
the number of unrelaxed ones was larger under a higher shear rate
because of the facilitation effect of shear flow on the formation
of oriented segments. The numerous numbers of oriented segments facilitated
the generation of PLLA crystals in the following crystallization,
and thus, the final crystallinity of PLLA was positively correlated
with the shear rate. On the other hand, the final crystallinity of
sample PLLA-190-0 was low, from 0.04 to 0.11 at the shear rates from
3.1 to 31.4 s–1, which was lower than that of PLLA-180-0.
Meanwhile, the crystallinity of PLLA-180-0 increased more notably,
from 0.16 to 0.33 at the shear rate range of 3.1–31.4 s–1. This phenomenon was attributed to the different
terminal relaxation behavior35,58 of PLLA molecular chains
under various shear temperatures. When the PLLA melt was sheared at
190 °C, the relaxation rate of PLLA molecular chains became larger
compared to PLLA-180-0, so it was difficult to preserve the locally
oriented segments even at 31.4 s–1. In that case,
the final crystallinity of sample PLLA-190-0 was low, almost without
variation. With respect to sample PLLA-170-0, the situation was totally
different. The relaxation time of PLLA with locally oriented segments
was long when the sample was sheared at 170 °C, and thus, numerous
of oriented segments were preserved and further induced nucleus generation
even at a low shear rate. Therefore, sample PLLA-170-0 possessed a
high crystallinity in the whole shear rate range (3.1–31.4
s–1), increasing from 0.23 to 0.33. Sample PLLA-180-0
was sheared at a temperature between the shearing temperatures of
PLLA-170-0 and PLLA-190-0 and hence possessed a medium crystallinity.
Compared to PLLA-170-0 and PLLA-190-0, sample PLLA-180-0 was more
sensitive to the shear rate because of its terminal relaxation behavior,
which resulted in a greater increase in crystallinity from 0.23 to
0.33 with increasing the shear rate from 3.1 to 31.4 s–1. Here, it must be noted that no oriented crystal was observed in
this work, instead of all spherulites. There were two reasons to cause
this result. One is that the shear rates applied on the samples were
relatively small (1.0–31.4 s–1) and not high
enough to induce the orientation of PLLA crystals. The other is that
the PLLA molecular chains were semirigid, which were not easy to be
oriented.

2.1.2 Effect of Annealing Time on PLLA Precursors
To explore the effects of annealing time on the PLLA precursor,
the samples were annealed for 0, 5, and 10 min after sheared at 180
°C. Figure 3 displays
the WAXD results of sample PLLA-180-10. One can see a series of Debye–Scherrer
rings in the 2D-WAXD patterns, among which the strongest ones were
(200, 110)α and (203)α, illustrating
the formation of isotropic α-crystal. In addition, four diffraction
peaks appeared at 2θ = 14.9°, 16.7°, 19.1°, and
22.3° in the corresponding 1D-WAXD profiles, which were assigned
to (010)α, (200, 110)α, (203)α, and (015)α, respectively. With increase
in shear rate, the intensities of 2D-WAXD diffraction rings and 1D-WAXD
diffraction peaks were all augmented, showing a facilitation effect
of shear flow on the crystallization of PLLA. Comparatively, the diffraction
rings and peaks intensities of sample annealed for 5 min (Figure S3) were stronger, illustrating that the
annealing treatment was adverse for PLLA crystallization.

and 1D-WAXD profiles for sample PLLA-180-10.

Figure 4 depicts
the crystallinities of samples PLLA-180-0, PLLA-180-5, and PLLA-180-10
against shear rate. The crystallinity of the static sample was close
to zero and not shown here, which suggested no facilitation effect
of annealing treatment on the PLLA crystallization under quiescence.
After annealing (5 and 10 min), the final crystallinity was low in
the whole shear rate range (3.1–31.4 s–1).
Regarding to sample PLLA-180-5, the final crystallinity increased
from 0.04 to 0.13 at shear rates ranging from 3.1 to 31.4 s–1, lower than sample PLLA-180-0. This was a result of the relaxation
of locally oriented segments of PLLA molecular chains during annealing.59,60 The oriented segments were induced to generate and to facilitate
the formation of PLLA nucleus after sheared at 180 °C. However,
many of the locally oriented segments relaxed, which resulted in a
decrease in final crystallinity when annealed for 5 min, that is,
the crystallinity decreased as the relaxation time of oriented segments
prolonged. Meanwhile, for the sample with an annealing time shorter
than 5 min, it could be inferred that its crystallinity was larger
than sample annealed for 5 min but smaller than sample unannealed
at the same shear rate, as the oriented segments relaxed sufficiently
with the annealing time prolonging. Definitely, the relaxation of
oriented PLLA segments will be complete if the annealing time is longer
(e.g., 10 min).

2.1.3 Effect of Pressure on PLLA Precursors under
an Equal Supercooling
The 2D-WAXD patterns and 1D-WAXD profiles
of sample PLLA-atm prepared under the same supercooling61 as PLLA-180-0 are given in Figure 5. A series of Debye–Scherrer
rings from isotropic α-crystal appeared at a low shear rate
(3.1 s–1). Among the rings, the strongest two were
(200, 110)α and (203)α. Meanwhile,
the corresponding diffraction peaks appeared in the 1D-WAXD profiles
at 2θ = 14.9°, 16.7°, 19.1°, and 22.3°,
being related to (010)α, (200, 110)α, (203)α, and (015)α, respectively.
The increase in shear rate induced a small enhancement in the intensities
of the 2D-WAXD diffraction rings and 1D-WAXD peaks, although the intensities
were weaker than those of PLLA-180-0 (Figure 5). These WAXD data demonstrated that high
pressure was beneficial for the formation of PLLA crystals under an
equal supercooling.

Figure 5 2D-WAXD patterns and 1D-WAXD profiles for sample PLLA-atm.

The quantitative results of samples
crystallized at 100 MPa and
atmosphere are displayed in Figure 6. It can be seen that the crystallization of samples
at both crystallization pressures was promoted by the shear rate,
illustrating a facilitation effect of shear flow on the PLLA crystallization
under both pressures. With respect to sample PLLA-atm, the crystallinity
increased from 0.05 to 0.26 when the shear rate increased from 3.1
to 31.4 s–1. Its crystallinity was lower than those
of samples prepared under 100 MPa in the whole shear rate range (3.1–31.4
s–1). The mobility of PLLA chains was low under
a high pressure because of the reduced free volume,62 that is, the relaxation rate of PLLA molecular chains decreased
at a high pressure (100 MPa) in contrast to at a low pressure (0.1
MPa).63,64 In addition, the molecular chains tended
to adapt to the pressurized state through forming small bundles with
locally oriented segments under the high pressure (100 MPa),65 which facilitated the generation of the precursor
with large size subsequently. Consequently, the crystallinity of the
sample under a high pressure was higher than that of samples obtained
at atmosphere and a low pressure.

and PLLA-atm under various
shear rates.

2.1.4 Thermal
Behavior of PLLA Precursors
To further shed light on the
effects of shear rate on the crystalline
structure of the samples sheared at different temperatures (170 and
180 °C), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements
were carried out for samples at various positions (shear rates) at
a heating scan rate of 10 °C/min, as shown in Figure 7. Undoubtedly, the shear flow
strongly influenced the melting behavior of PLLA. All the three curves
in Figure 7a exhibit
obvious dual-melting behavior, and the area ratio of the high melting
peak to the low one increased with the shear rate increasing. Here,
the dual-melting behavior resulted from dual lamella population (Figure S4a), and the melting temperature referred
to the intense melting peak of the dual-melting peaks (primary crystal
morphology in a specific sample).66,67 With the shear
rate increasing, chain segments were oriented more easily and lamellae
with larger thicknesses13 and fewer flaws
were induced (Figure S4b). As a result,
the area of melting peak increased after applying high shear rates.
Meanwhile, oriented segments with a large size (aggregation of oriented
segments) generated, causing an elevation of PLLA melting temperature.
In addition, the cold crystallization peak illustrated the imperfection
of the crystal, in keeping with the WAXD data. Considering the bigger
shear rate dependency, the melting temperature change of the sample
sheared at 180 °C (Figure 7b) over the shear rates was more notable than that of PLLA-170-0.

shear rates.

Figure 8 depicts
the DSC heating curves of samples PLLA-170-0, PLLA-180-0, and PLLA-190-0.
Compared to sample PLLA-170-0, the samples sheared at 180 and 190
°C exhibited a single melting peak because of their stronger
molecular mobility. The melting temperature was negatively correlated
with shear temperature, decreasing from 168.5 to 166.9 °C at
shear temperatures from 170 to 190 °C. When shear temperature
increased, the relaxation of PLLA molecular chains was faster and
the precursors with small sizes were generated, which resulted in
final thinner lamellae (Figure S4b–d) and a decrease in melting temperature.

Figure 8 DSC heating curves of
PLLA-170-0, PLLA-180-0, and PLLA-190-0 at
a shear rate of 31.4 s–1.

Figure 9 shows
the
DSC heating curves of PLLA-180-0, PLLA-180-5, and PLLA-180-10 at a
shear rate of 31.4 s–1. It is seen that the annealing
time strongly affected the melting temperature of PLLA. Annealing
treatment at shear temperature for 10 min helped the molecular chains
to relax and to generate precursors with small sizes, and thus, the
final lamellae were thin (Figure S4c,e).
Consequently, the melting temperature decreased from 167.6 to 164.3
°C when annealing time was prolonged to 10 min.

Figure 9 DSC heating curves of
PLLA-180-0, PLLA-180-5, and PLLA-180-10 at
a shear rate of 31.4 s–1.

The DSC heating curves of PLLA-180-0 and PLLA-atm at a shear
rate
of 31.4 s–1 are shown in Figure 10. The melting temperature of the sample
prepared under 100 MPa (i.e., PLLA-180-0) was a little higher than
that of the sample under atmosphere. This should be attributed to
the different aggregated morphologies of molecular chains under pressure.
The molecular chains of the sample prepared under a high pressure
tended to form locally oriented segment bundles and caused the generation
of precursors with a large size, which forming thicker lamellae (Figure S4c,f) subsequently. Meanwhile, the easy
slippage of molecular chains within lamellae under a high pressure
facilitated the perfection of PLLA crystals and, as a result, increased
the PLLA crystallinity.68

PLLA-180-0 and PLLA-atm at a shear rate of

2.2 Discussion
The present work was carried
out under the coexistence of pressure (atmosphere and 100 MPa) and
flow field (varied shear rates 3.1–31.4 s–1) to explore the effects of pressure, shear temperature, and annealing
time on PLLA precursors. Under an equal supercooling, a high shear
rate, a proper shear temperature, and a high pressure were three facilitating
factors to promote the formation of precursor. Annealing treatment
could accelerate the relaxation of oriented segments induced by shear
flow and hence restrain the formation of PLLA precursor. However,
all these results were obtained via a series of non-real-time measurements.
The generation process of precursor was inferred from the final structure
of PLLA samples. In view of this, we utilized a rotational rheometer
to simulate the crystallization process of PLLA under various conditions
and measured the changes of the samples timely.

2.2.1 Effects
of Shear Temperature on the Formation
of PLLA Precursors
Considering that high pressures could
not be applied on the samples during the rotational rheometer measurement,
we sheared the samples at 150, 160, and 170 °C instead, where
the supercoolings were equal to the cases of higher shear temperatures
(170, 180, and 190 °C, respectively) under a high pressure. Figure 11 displays the G′ curves of the samples sheared at 150, 160, and
170 °C and crystallized at 140 °C (the samples are named
PLLA-150-140, PLLA-160-140, and PLLA-170-140, respectively). For samples
PLLA-150-140 and PLLA-160-140, G′ increased
quickly with time, illustrating the quick crystallization rate and
the formation of a large number of locally oriented segments. The
oriented segments facilitated the following isothermal crystallization
and improved the induction rate, which caused a sudden rise of G′. Consequently, the crystallinities of PLLA-170-0
and PLLA-180-0 were higher than that of PLLA-190-0. Meanwhile, when
the shear temperature was elevated to 170 °C, the induction time
(t0) prolonged obviously (1250 s), which
implied that more oriented chains relaxed at 170 °C. This is
the reason for the low crystallinity of PLLA-190-0. As we all know,
the mechanical work of flow (ω) can be used judgement whether
shish-kebabs are formed during FIC. Here, the mechanical work done
on the PLLA melts was introduced to understand the morphology of PLLA
chains and calculated by eq 1 1  where η is the shear rate dependent
viscosity, t the shear time, and γ̇ the
shear rate. In Figure S5a, we display the
mechanical work of the samples undergoing different shear conditions.
The mechanical work of PLLA melt decreased with the shear temperature
elevating (9.33 × 107 J/m at 150 °C, 6.01 ×
107 J/m at 160 °C, and 4.05 × 107 J/m
at 170 °C) at a shear rate of 31.4 s–1. It
was verified that the contribution of shear flow on the PLLA precursors
was larger at a low shear temperature. This resulted from the large
number of oriented segments and the weak relaxation of oriented PLLA
segments. Regarding to the relaxation behavior of polymer chains,
the relaxation time (τd) is shown in Figure S5b. The relaxation time can be calculated
according to eq 2, which
describes the relationship of Weissenberg number (Wi), shear rate (γ̇), and relaxation time (τd). Weissenberg number is always applied to quantify the strength
of shear flow in FIC process, which could be attained from the rheology
measurement. 2  

Figure 11 G′ curves during the isothermal
crystallization
at 140 °C for the samples sheared at 150, 160, and 170 °C,
respectively. Samples PLLA-150-140, PLLA-160-140, and PLLA-170-140
were sheared at 31.4 s–1 for 6 s and then cooled
to 140 °C to crystallize isothermally. The time started once
the samples were cooled to Tc.

The relaxation time of PLLA-160-140 was the longest
in contrast
to PLLA-150-140 and PLLA-170-140 when the shear rate exceeded 12.5
s–1, indicating that the oriented PLLA segments
of PLLA-160-140 needed the longest time to recover to a randomly entangled
state. Therefore, the molecular chains of PLLA-160-140 (represented
PLLA-180) were sensitive to the shear flow, and the crystallinity
of which intensely changed with shear rate. In other words, the results
of mechanical work and relaxation time verified that the reason for
the high shear sensitivity of PLLA-180-0 was attributed to the most
sensitive response on the relaxation behavior of PLLA chains compared
to the samples sheared at 170 and 190 °C (Figure 2). During the crystallization process, the
rise speed of G′ for sample PLLA-150-140 was
higher than that of PLLA-160-140, suggesting that the sample sheared
at 150 °C crystallized more quickly than that at 160 °C.
This result further demonstrated that the sample sheared at a lower
temperature tended to generate more precursors and crystallize faster.
This simulation further verified that the high shear temperature suppressed
the formation of precursor and slowed down the crystallization, which
further decreased the crystallinity of PLLA and changed its crystalline
structure (Figure S4).

2.2.2 Effects of Annealing Time on the Formation
of PLLA Precursors
The effects of annealing time on the precursor
were also simulated by a rotational rheometer. Figure 12 displays the G′
curves against time for samples PLLA-160-0-140, PLLA-160-5-140, and
PLLA-160-10-140, namely, for the samples annealed for 0, 5 and 10
min, respectively. Here, the samples were first sheared for 6 s at
160 °C at a shear rate of 31.4 s–1 and then
cooled to the crystallization temperature after annealed at shear
temperatures for a specific time. The G′ of
sample PLLA-160-0-140 rose quickly and then suddenly dropped at 36
s, suggesting a break of crystal networks. Regarding to the samples
annealed for 5 and 10 min, the rising rate of G′
was slower than that of the sample without annealing, and no sudden
drop appeared during the crystallization process. This result illustrated
that the crystal networks formed when the sample was sheared at 160
°C, while the annealing treatment suppressed the formation of
crystal networks. After the sample was annealed for a specific time,
its locally oriented segments induced under shear flow relaxed, which
caused a decrease in the number of precursors. This conclusion could
also be verified by the results of Figure S6b. It is well known that the oriented structure is more likely to
form when Wi > 1. Here, the critical shear rate
for
the oriented structure was extracted from the crossovers of storage
and loss modulus curves were 22.7, 20.7, and 19.5 s–1 for the PLLA samples sheared at 150, 160, and 170 °C, respectively
(Figure S6). The critical relaxation times
were calculated based on eq 2 and the critic shear rate data (0.045, 0.048, and 0.051 s
for PLLA-150-140, PLLA-160-140, and PLLA-170-140, respectively). Considering
that a high pressure (100 MPa) enhanced the viscosity and the oriented
structure became difficult to relax, we know that the real critical
relaxation time was slightly longer than the calculated one. However,
the critic relaxation time of sample PLLA-160-140 was far shorter
than 1 min, that is, the relaxation of oriented PLLA segments for
the annealed samples was sufficiently completed, especially after
an annealing of 10 min. Consequently, the following crystallization
process of the annealed samples was slow, which was the reason for
no sudden drop of G′. This simulation result
further testified that annealing time was adverse for the formation
of precursor because of the sufficient relaxation process.

Figure 12 G′ curves of samples sheared at 160 °C
and isothermally crystallized at 140 °C. Samples PLLA-160-0-140,
PLLA-160-5-140, and PLLA-160-10-140 were first sheared at 31.4 s–1 for 6 s, then annealed for 0, 5, and 10 min, respectively,
and finally cooled to 140 °C to isothermally crystallize. The
time started once the samples were cooled to Tc.

3 Conclusions
In the present work, the effects of shear temperature, annealing
time, and pressure on the formation of PLLA precursor were investigated
with the help of a homemade PSD. Under high shear rates, more locally
oriented segments of PLLA molecular chains were generated, which induced
the formation of a large number of precursors and finally caused an
increase in crystallinity. Meanwhile, when the shear temperature was
elevated, the relaxation of the locally oriented segments was quicker.
Therefore, the number of precursors under a higher shear temperature
decreased, causing a decrease in the final crystallinity. In addition,
the thickness of lamellae decreased with the increase in shear temperature
based on the results of DSC and SEM. The relaxation was more notable
after annealing, and thus, the number of precursors decreased, leading
to a drop of the final crystallinity. Pressure was another significant
factor that had great effects on the formation of PLLA precursor.
Under an intermediate supercooling, the high pressure facilitated
the formation of locally oriented segment bundles, and therefore more
locally oriented segments generated to further promote the formation
of precursors. Beyond that, the crystallization ability was improved
under a high pressure, which was another reason for the increased
crystallinity under a high pressure. Meanwhile, the thickness of lamella
was thicker under a high pressure than that at atmosphere. All these
experimental results had significant meanings for understanding the
crystallization process of PLLA and for preparing high performance
products of PLLA by optimizing the crystallization process.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
PLLA used in this work
was purchased from Nature Networks (PLLA, trade name 4032D) with composing
of 2% d-LA. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) is 2.23 × 105 g/mol, and
the number-average molecular weight (Mn) is 1.06 × 105 g/mol. The melting temperature of
PLLA 4032D is 167 °C, which was measured by a DSC system at a
heating rate of 10 °C/min.

4.2 Sample
Preparation
PSD was employed
to prepare disk-shaped PLLA samples, just as Figure 13a shows. To apply a specific shear rate,
the shear flow was exerted to PLLA melts through a rotating rotator
at a specific angular speed. In this experiment, the angular speed
was π/2 for all samples. Figure 13b exhibits the obtained PLLA disk-shaped
samples, which have a radius of 10 mm and a thickness of 0.5 mm. The
shear rates exerted on PLLA melts increase linearly with the radius
increasing from the core to the edge of sample. Therefore, the maximal
shear rate appears at the edge and is 31.4 s–1,
which was calculated by the formula of  (ω is the angular
speed of rotator,
γ̇ the shear rate, r the distance of
tested position and core, and d the thickness of
sample). The test positions and the related shear rates are shown
in Figure 13b. The
following measurements for all the samples are based on this. Note
that the crystallinity of the samples without preshearing was on the
verge of zero. Considering that the crystallization under quiescent
conditions was not our focus, the shear rate selected in this experiment
started from 1.0 s–1.

shear rate along the radius direction of sample.

4.3 Experimental Procedure
The experimental
temperature, shear, and pressure procedure were set as follows (Figure 14):(1) solid PLLA from
room temperature to
200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min;

(2) Holding the temperature at 200 °C
for 5 min to eliminate the memory of previous thermal and mechanical
histories;

(3) Cooling
to Ts at a cooling rate of 5 °C/min;

(4) Pressuring to a specific
value (Pc) within 5 min once the temperature
reached Ts;

(5) Applying a shear flow at a shear rate
of π/2 for a shear time of 6 s after the pressure reached Pc.

(6) Holding the temperature at Ts and the
pressure at Pc for a specific time (ta).

(7) Cooling to a crystallization temperature
(Tc) at a cooling rate of 5 °C/min,
holding the temperature at Tc and the
pressure at Pc for 30 min.

(8) Cooling to room temperature at a cooling
rate of 20 °C/min.



Figure 14 Experimental temperature,
shear, and pressure procedure.

The whole procedure was done under a nitrogen atmosphere
to avoid
the influence of oxygen. For convenience, the sample that is named
PLLA-Ts-ta means it was isothermally crystallized for a time of ta at a temperature of Ts after
shearing. For example, PLLA-180-10 represents the sample prepared
under the condition Ts = 180 °C and ta = 10 min. The crystallization conditions of
samples are displayed in Table 1.

PLLA-180-0	180	0	100	160	
PLLA-190-0	190	0	100	160	
PLLA-180-5	180	5	100	160	
PLLA-180-10	180	10	100	160

4.4 2D-WAXD Measurement
To explore the
structure information along the radial direction of the prepared PLLA
sample, a small sector was chosen and cut off from the sample as shown
in Figure 13b. The
X-ray beam, perpendicular to the surface of disk, moved from the center
to the edge of the sample along the radial direction to characterize
the crystalline structure at different positions. For all samples,
the thickness was 0.5 mm. Therefore, the effect of thickness on the
X-ray signals could be eliminated, and the intensity could be compared
directly. The radial positions 0.5, 1.5, ..., 9.5 mm were corresponding
to shear rates about 1.0, 3.1, ..., 19.9 s–1, respectively.
The measurements were carried out at the beamline BL15U1 of Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, Shanghai, China) with a wavelength
of 0.124 nm, and a distance of 165 mm from the sample to the X-ray
CCD detector (model Mar165, 2048 × 2048 pixels of 80 μm
× 80 μm).

To determine the crystallinity of PLLA,
the 1D-WAXD intensity profiles were processed with the help of Origin
software, assuming Gaussian profiles for the amorphous halo and all
crystalline peaks. The crystallinity of α-form (Xc) was calculated by using eq 3 3  where, A(010)α, A(200,110)α, A(203)α, A(015)α are representative of the areas of PLLA (010)α,
(200, 110)α, (203)α, (015)α diffraction peaks, respectively, and Aamorphous is the area of corresponding amorphous peak.

4.5 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC analysis was carried out using
a DSC system (TA DSC Q2000)
from 40 to 200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Indium
was used for revising before measurement. The samples were cut from
three marked positions, and the weight of sample was about 5 mg.

4.6 Rotational Rheometry Measurement
A rotational
rheometer (AR2000EX, TA Instruments) was used to measure
the rheological properties for PLLA samples under various temperatures
and shear rates. The diameter of the tested plate was 25 mm and the
tested distance was 0.7 mm. Dynamic frequency sweeps in the linear
viscoelastic regime were performed at 150–190 °C with
a frequency range from 100 to 0.01 Hz. In addition, the crystallization
process of PLLA was simulated by the rotational rheometer in an oscillatory
time sweep mode. The sample was first heated to 200 °C and held
for 5 min to eliminate the memory of previous thermal histories. Then,
the sample was cooled to Ts (150, 160,
and 170 °C). After a step shear pulse at a shear rate of 31.4
s–1, the sample was further cooled to 140 °C
to isothermally crystallize for 30 min followed by a time sweep test.
The time sweep test provided the changes in storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″)
of the sample with time during the crystallization process.
