The use of cement raw meals as sorbent
precursors for CO2 capture can reinforce the synergies
between the cement production
process and calcium looping CO2 capture technology. In
this work, we measure the CO2-carrying capacity of different
calcined samples of a particular marl, which were obtained under very
different calcination conditions and setups (a thermogravimetric analyzer,
a drop tube furnace, and an industrial calciner). We find that the
reactivity toward CO2 of these calcined materials displays
a strong sensitivity to the calcination conditions, in particular
to calcination time. A pronounced competition between the belite (Ca2SiO4) formation reaction and the formation of free
CaO needed for CO2 capture is detected. As the calcination
of the raw meal approaches flash conditions (i.e., >90% calcination
conversion in less than 10 s), the belite formation is shown to be
minimized, leading to sorbents with CO2-carrying capacities
of approximately 0.4 mol CO2/mol CaO.

==== Body
Introduction
The cement industry is responsible for
5% of global CO2 emissions when only the decomposition
of CaCO3 in the
process is taken into account.1 Therefore,
those emissions can only be avoided by CO2 capture and
storage technologies, niche uses of CO2 involving recarbonation
of the cement materials,2,3 or passive carbonation
of the global inventory of cement-made materials that has been reported
to offset 43% of the current emissions.4

The postcombustion CO2 capture technology, calcium
looping
(CaL), has been developed over the last decade up to 2 MW scale.5−10 The CaL process is based on the reaction of CaO, with CO2 to form CaCO3, which subsequently is decomposed again
to CaO in an oxy-fuel-fired calciner. The synergies between the CaL
technology and the cement sector have been recognized almost from
the beginning of the CaL development.11−22 There are different possibilities to apply this technology to the
cement sector for which the integration level with the cement plant
will be different.10,23−28 The highest level of integration can be achieved if the source of
CaO for the CaL systems is the cement raw meal itself, instead of
limestone,24,25,28 taking advantage of the fact that a typical raw meal contains approximately
80 wt % of CaCO3.29 In this
configuration, the precalciner of the cement plant is switched to
oxy-fuel combustion mode and hence it is used as the calciner of a
CaL system.24,25,28 In the carbonator, only the CO2 from the additional fuel
combustion and residual calcination of the sorbent in the rotary kiln
is captured.30 Although the inert materials
present in the raw meal will affect the energy balance in the CaL,
by increasing the heat requirements in the calciner, it is well understood
that the large makeup will compensate the energy penalties by increasing
the average activity of the sorbent.18,20,23−25

The use of calcined raw
meals as potential CO2 sorbents
in CaL was only recently investigated at the particle level31,32 in thermogravimetric analyzers (TGAs), looking for the kinetic information
needed for the design of the reactors in the system: mainly the carbonation
kinetics and the CO2 carrying capacity of the free CaO
present in the calcined raw meal. It was concluded from these studies
that the formation of belite (Ca2SiO4) could
greatly affect the CaO activity over multiple cycles at typical calcination
conditions (i.e., temperatures above 900 °C and high CO2 concentrations). Raw meals with low aggregation levels between Ca
compounds and Si compounds (i.e., raw meals mixed by comilling the
limestone-rich and clay-rich fractions) can be used as effective CO2 sorbents, whereas high aggregation levels of Ca–Si,
as in natural marl minerals, yield highly deactivated sorbents of
modest use for CO2 capture.32 This is in principle a negative result regarding the viability of
highly integrated CaL configurations in many existing cement plants,
which use the marl-type raw meals (i.e., with a high aggregation level
of Ca–Si in the raw meal). The utilization of such raw meals
in clinker production is preferred because the milling and mixing
operations in the clinker process are greatly facilitated. It is therefore
important to better understand if the results from these initial studies
in TGAs are sufficiently significant and general regarding the calcination
conditions. One of the key observations in earlier studies using TGA
was that great differences in the behavior of different raw meals
were observed when the calcination time was reduced to 1 min.32 In the commercial flash calciners that are widely
applied in modern cement plants, shorter calcination times (i.e.,
with gas residence times on the order of 10 s) are common. These conditions
are not reproducible in laboratory-scale TGAs. Therefore, the present
work explores the CO2 reactivity and carrying capacity
of a typical marl-type raw meal calcined under flash calcination conditions
with typical air and oxy-fuel fired combustion atmospheres, confirming
that the calcination time is a critical variable to determine the
activity toward CO2 capture in the marl-type calcined raw
meals.

Experimental Section
Materials
The marl-type raw meal
used in this work
(the same material used as RM1 in ref (24)) has a chemical composition as shown in Table 1.

Experimental Setup and Methods
The
raw meal was calcined
in an entrained flow (EF) reactor setup at IFK’s BTS-VR facility,
which was operated to simulate the flash calcination of the raw meal
in conditions similar to industrial flash calciners. The calcined
samples from an industrial cement plant using the same raw meal were
also tested and the results are discussed below. A schematic of IFK’s
BTS-VR setup is shown in Figure 1. The cylindrical, electrically heated furnace of this
facility is 2.5 m in height and 200 mm in diameter. The heating system
is divided into 5 sections, which can be individually controlled to
a given wall temperature. By means of a temperature-controlled sampling
probe, solids and gases can be sampled at various points along the
reactor height. The cooling of the probe allows for a rapid quenching
of the sampled gas and material once they enter the probe. Furthermore,
access ports positioned at the top and bottom (axial access) and at
0.5 and 1.5 m (radial access) from the top of the furnace allow for
a determination of axial and radial temperature profiles within the
furnace.

Figure 1 Schematic of the entrained flow reactor BTS-VR of IFK.

The raw meal was calcined under two different atmospheres
in this
setup. The first one (air-fired) corresponds to the typical conditions
of precalciners in cement plants (i.e., 20 vol % CO2, 3
vol % O2, and balance N2). The second condition
(oxy-fired) corresponds to the conditions of an oxy-fuel fired CaL
calciner (i.e., 80 vol % CO2, 3 vol % O2, and
balance N2).

The experimental procedure in this facility
started with an average
axial temperature profile inside the reactor before the raw meal injection
of 880 °C for the air-fired calcination and 960 °C for the
oxy-fuel-fired calcination. These temperatures were chosen to ensure
a residence time sufficient to achieve a calcination efficiency of
approximately 90% for both cases. The raw meal was fed by a gravimetrically
controlled screw feeder at a feeding rate of 1 kg/h and injected into
the reactor using a circular injection pipe. Additional gases were
injected via two annuli to adjust the gas atmosphere as well as the
residence time. The carrier gas was preheated to 650 °C, whereas
the primary and secondary gases were preheated to 550 °C using
electric gas heaters. A total gas flow of 10.5 m3/h (STP)
was used in both cases. On that basis, an average particle residence
time in the reactor of approximate 6.2 s can be estimated. Samples
of the calcined raw meal presented in this study were taken at the
reactor outlet (2.5 m) using the cooled sampling probe.

The
calciner that provided industrially calcined raw meal samples
is located in a Heidelberg cement plant in Arrigorriaga (Spain). As
in other cement plants, in this facility, the raw meal is precalcined
in an entrained flow (flash) calciner before entering the clinker
kiln. In this plant, the average temperature in this calciner is approximately
900 °C and the average CO2 concentration is approximately
20 vol %. The calcined samples from the inlet of the kiln were extracted
and rapidly cooled down to minimize solid–solid reactions.

The calcination efficiency of the samples was checked through the
analysis of the initial carbon content of the samples by using a LECO
C/S 230 analyzer. Table 2 shows the carbon weight fractions (wC) of the fresh and calcined samples measured by the analyzer, the
calcination degree estimated by (1 – wC,sample/wC,fresh), and the calcination
conditions. Here, wC,fresh is the carbon
weight fraction of the fresh raw meal (i.e., 0.1). As seen, the calcination
degree (0.88) is similar in the oxy-fired and air-fired calcination
conditions, as the higher concentration of CO2 in the latter
is compensated with higher calcination temperatures, which were increased
to achieve similar calcination efficiencies. This value for the air-fired
sample obtained at BTS-VR was also compared to the gas composition
sampled at the reactor outlet mass balances, yielding a good agreement.
The carbon content in the sample from the industrial calciner is almost
2.8 times higher than that from the flash calcination tests at BTS-VR,
indicating a lower calcination degree in the industrial calciner (0.66
or a molar fraction of CaCO3 of 0.28).

BTS-VR and the Industrial Plant Measured by LECO CS-230

In addition to the analysis of the carbon content,
all calcined
raw meal samples were also analyzed for their maximum CO2-carrying capacity by a TGA. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the samples were determined by using a Siemens D5000 X-ray
diffractometer.

The homemade TGA and the experimental procedure
to determine the
CO2-carrying capacities were described in detail elsewhere.32,33 The sample is placed in a platinum basket suspended inside a mullite
tube of 2.54 × 10–2 m OD. The mullite tube
was surrounded by two electrical ovens controlled independently by
two temperature controllers. The bottom oven was used as a gas preheater,
whereas the upper oven was used to set the sample temperature. The
sample temperature was measured by a thermocouple located 5 mm below
the sample. The reactant gases were fed to the bottom of the tube
and the flow rates were controlled by mass-flow controllers. The sample
weight, temperatures, and gas flows were continuously recorded on
a computer during the analysis.

The determination of the maximum
CO2-carrying capacity
was performed using initial sample weights of approximately 15 mg
to use a representative and sufficiently large sample mass without
the extensive effects caused by limited gas diffusion within the sample
batch in the TGA system. As this weight is still larger than the weight
needed to avoid diffusional resistance (i.e., approximately 3 mg34), the carbonation times were increased to ensure
a good reading of the asymptotic value of the maximum CO2-carrying capacity. In the used TGA system, this time is approximately
10 min at a gas velocity of 0.06 m/s. Therefore, the conversion at
10 min was adopted from this point as the CO2-carrying
capacity of each material. At the beginning of the test, the sample
was heated up from room temperature to 650 °C in an air atmosphere.
Once the temperature was stabilized, a mixture of 10 vol % CO2 in air was fed to the sample during 10 min. Then, the atmosphere
was changed back to the air without CO2 and the temperature
was increased to 900 °C. This temperature was maintained for
1 min to ensure the complete calcination of the sample. Blank tests
were carried out to correct the buoyancy effect of the basket in the
TGA system.

Figure 2 shows an
example of the weight and temperature changes as a function of time
when the described procedure was applied to the samples. When the
samples contain a certain amount of CaCO3 at the beginning
of the analysis, an unavoidable calcination will occur during the
heat-up to 650 °C in air. Once the gas mixture containing CO2 is fed, CaO reacts with CO2 and the weight increases
sharply. During the calcination (see Figure 2), which is initiated with the change in
the gas mixture back to air, the evolution of the sample weight is
self-explanatory.

Figure 2 Example of the evolution of the weight and temperature
signals
during a typical test in the TGA.

From the changes in the weight measured in the TGA and the
chemical
composition of the raw meal, the initial molar fraction of CaCO3 and the maximum carrying capacity of the sample can be calculated.

Finally, the X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out over the
samples from BTS-VR and the industrial plant. The diffraction data
were collected by step scanning using a step size of 0.02°, a
scan step time of 4 s, and a scan range of 2θ of 5–60°.

Results and Discussion
As noted in a recent study,32 marl-type
raw meals yield CO2-carrying capacities lower than expected:
(X1 < 0.25) when an equivalent limestone
would give X1 ∼ 0.70 under the
same conditions. This is due to the rapid formation of belite, facilitated
by the intimate mixing of Ca and Si atoms in marls. The main target
of the experiments carried out in this work has been to elucidate
if reducing the calcination times to the range of those expected in
industrial entrained flow calciners (a few seconds) could possibly
allow detection of a significant improvement in the CO2-carrying capacities of the calcined raw meals.

The molar conversion
of CaO vs time during the carbonation test
in the TGA system (discounting the initial content of CaCO3 in all samples) is shown in Figure 3, left for all calcined samples. Moreover, four carbonation
tests were carried out over the fresh raw meal calcined in the TGA
(without previous flash calcination) for comparison purposes (Figure 3, right).

Figure 3 Left: molar
conversion of CaO of the calcined samples vs time during
the carbonation test in the TGA system (empty symbols: air-fired conditions;
black circles oxy-fired conditions). Right: molar conversion of CaO
vs time of the raw meal calcined in the TGA after different calcination
histories (UHC: uncoupled heating and calcination; CHC: coupled heating
and calcination; empty symbols: νCO2 = 0; black symbol:
νCO2 = 0.7).

Comparing the maximum carrying capacity of the oxy-fired
(BTS-VR)
and air-fired (BTS-VR) samples, the decrease of 0.05 can likely be
attributed to the difference in the calcination temperature between
the two conditions. The highest CO2-carrying capacity of
the calcined samples was found for the sample calcined in the air-fired
conditions (empty circles). The maximum carrying capacity was 0.42,
which is close to the maximum carrying capacity measured in a TGA
test when the fresh raw meal was calcined in air during 1 min at 900
°C and the calcination of the CaCO3 contained in the
sample was avoided during the heating of the sample up to the calcination
temperature i.e., by heating in 100 vol % CO2, the calcination
and the heating is uncoupled (UHC) (Figure 3, right, empty circles). This outcome seems
to indicate that despite differences in the times of heating between
an EF reactor (i.e., seconds) and the TGA (i.e., minutes), it may
be possible to simulate the EF results in a TGA if the heating and
the calcination can be uncoupled. If the same TGA test was carried
out at 800 °C, the maximum carrying capacity measured was 0.64,
which is similar to the maximum average carrying capacity of CaO from
limestone (i.e., 0.7). Therefore, the calcination temperature has
a strong effect on the reaction rate of the belite formation from
CaO in the raw meals. When the test was carried out at 900 °C,
enabling simultaneous calcination and heating (i.e., coupled heating
and calcination noted in the Figure 3 as (CHC-900)), the maximum carrying capacity achieved
was only X1 = 0.23. Thus, taking into
account the fact that the thermal history was the same as in the UHC-900
test, it is clear that the extended calcination time causes a sharp
increase in the belite formation from CaO at these high temperatures.
Moreover, it can be calculated that this is the maximum carrying capacity
that can be achieved, assuming that all SiO2 reacts to
form Ca2SiO4 and the remaining free CaO can
reach a carrying capacity of 0.7 (similar to the calcined limestone).

When comparing the results from the calcination in CO2-rich oxy-fuel atmospheres, the maximum carrying capacity of the
oxy-fuel calcined samples from BTS-VR (i.e., X1 = 0.37) is higher than the maximum carrying capacity measured
for the samples calcined in the TGA in oxy-fuel conditions (Figure 3 right, black circles,
with X1 = 0.23). This outcome is again
a consequence of the unavoidable long time required to calcine the
sample in the TGA setup, which is due to the relatively slow heating
rate of the sample. Indeed, for the calcination test in the TGA in
a CO2-rich atmosphere (UHC-930) and the test with coupled
heating and calcination (CHC-900), the maximum carrying capacity measured
is similar (X1 = 0.23) because, in both
cases, there is sufficient time to fully convert the available silica
in the marl-type raw meal sample to belite. Thus, when the calcination
temperature is higher than 900 °C, the TG apparatus is unable
to simulate the results from flash calciner reactors and can yield
misleadingly low values of CO2-carrying capacities for
the marl-type calcined raw meals.

The molar CO2-carrying
capacity of 0.37, which was reached
for the marl-type raw meal sample calcined under oxy-fuel conditions
allows for 0.19 g CO2 to be absorbed per gram of the calcined
sorbent. This outcome is in the same range as the typical CO2-carrying capacities of CaO obtained from the pure CaCO3 calcination with a molar CaO conversion of 0.24. Such a CO2-carrying capacity would allow for high CO2 capture efficiencies
in standard CaL systems.35 Taking into
account the fact that in a CaL system for a cement plant, the sorbent
would only experience a low cycle number, due to the high makeup of
the freshly calcined raw meal (i.e., sorbent), this means that this
raw meal can be a suitable sorbent as long as the sorbent calcination
is rapid (i.e., flash calcination).

Finally, the maximum carrying
capacity of the industrially calcined
sample was X1 = 0.20. This is consistent
with a very high conversion of CaO to belite. In this sample, all
available silica in the original marl must have consumed CaO when
forming belite and/or potentially other compounds may have reacted
with active CaO, as the carrying capacity is slightly lower than the
maximum carrying capacity in the case of full conversion to belite
(X1 = 0.23). This result is also in contrast
with the higher value of X1 obtained in
the flash calciner of IFK under more controlled (air-fired and oxy-fuel-fired)
conditions.

To support the previous discussion, XRD analyses
were carried out
for 3 different calcined raw meal samples (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 XRD spectra of the raw meal samples calcined
in an industrial calciner
and the BTS-VR calciner.

As seen in the samples from BTS-VR, CaO, SiO2,
CaCO3, and Ca2SiO4 can be identified.
However,
in the sample from the industrial calciner, CaCO3, CaO,
SiO2, Ca2SiO4, and Ca3SiO5, as well as signals of the minor compounds with a
lower Ca/Si ratio, such as Ca3Si2O7, CaSiO3, Ca3Al2O6, Ca9(Al6O18), and CaSi, were found. Therefore,
the hypothesis with respect to the presence of other Ca–Si
and Ca–Al compounds, which are able to consume active CaO in
addition to belite, is confirmed and can explain the very low CO2-carrying capacity observed in the sample from the industrial
calciner.

From a practical point of view, the low CO2-carrying
capacity displayed by the sample from the air-fired industrial calciner,
despite its favorable nominal calcination conditions (average temperature:
900 °C), is an indication that the temperature profile and/or
the residence times of the solids in the calciner of the plant are
higher than those in the laboratory-scale entrained flow reactor BTS-VR
at IFK. Unfortunately, we do not have detailed information to elucidate
this issue at this point in more detail, but it becomes clear that
the calciner design will be a critical element for the successful
integration of a CaL system to cement plants using marl-type raw meals.
In such facilities, flash calcination conditions with an accurate
temperature control and short particle residence times need to be
ensured to keep a raw meal-based sorbent active for CO2 sorption.

Conclusions
Marl-type raw meals can retain sufficient
CO2-carrying
capacities and can be used as effective CO2-capturing sorbents
in the CaL systems when the calcination is carried out under flash
calcination conditions (i.e., short calcination times of less than
10 s at temperatures up to 960 °C). When the calcination temperature
is higher than 900 °C, the TGA systems are unable to simulate
the results from flash calciner reactors and can yield misleadingly
low values of CO2-carrying capacities of the marl-type
calcined raw meals. At longer calcination times and high temperatures
over 900 °C, the formation of belite (and maybe other Ca–Si
or Ca–Al compounds) will consume CaO and make a large fraction
of the free CaO unavailable for carbonation. Hence, this will severely
reduce a material’s CO2 capture capacity. Therefore,
the calciner design turns into a critical element for the successful
implementation of a CaL system that uses the marl-type cement raw
meal as a sorbent. In such systems, great care needs to be put into
ensuring flash calcination conditions of the raw meal with an accurate
temperature control and short particle residence times.
