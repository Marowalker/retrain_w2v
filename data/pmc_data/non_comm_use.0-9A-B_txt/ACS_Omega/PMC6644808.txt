Immobilization
of TiO2-based photocatalysts usually
suffers from lowered surface area and mass transfer limitation compared
with their suspended counterpart. In this work, TiO2–SiO2 monolithic photocatalysts having straight macropores, called
microhoneycombs, were synthesized. The obtained samples had straight
macropores with a diameter in the range of 15–40 μm formed
by walls having a thickness up to 5 μm. The samples also contain
micropores and small mesopores inside their walls, which contribute
to high surface areas of more than 500 m2 g–1. Synthesized photocatalysts were tested in a continuous flow system
using the decolorization of methylene blue as a model reaction. It
was found that the unique morphology of the samples can be used to
promote the uniform distribution of the target fluid while reducing
the pressure drop across the photocatalyst to less than a hundredth
compared with a packed bed system. In addition, calcination at 600–800
°C improved the strength and photocatalytic activity of the monoliths
while preserving the high surface area of the samples.

Introduction
The use of photocatalytic
reactions in wastewater treatment has
gained much attention for decades.1 By
using this technique, pollutants can be nonselectively degraded to
benign substances, such as carbon dioxide and water.1,2 This aspect is different from conventional techniques such as adsorption
or coagulation, which merely transfers the pollutants to another phase.3−5 Photocatalytic degradation can also destroy some toxic and persistent
molecules where biological treatments are ineffective.3,6 Moreover, there are many results in the literature showing that
sunlight, which is free and renewable, can be used in photocatalysis
as well.7,8

Despite many advantages, the use of
photocatalytic degradation
in wastewater treatment at a commercial scale remains limited due
to the difficulty in the scaling up of the treatment system.9 Usually, the configuration of photocatalytic
systems can be categorized into either suspended systems or immobilized
systems.7,9,10 Suspended
systems generally provide a larger surface area per volume as well
as minimal mass transfer limitation (when well agitated). However,
the necessity of separation of photocatalyst particles from the treated
stream makes it difficult to scale up such systems. Although immobilization
of photocatalyst particles can be used to avoid the separation step,
this type of configuration generally has a lower surface area than
suspended systems and is usually limited by mass transfer.

There
have also been many attempts to intensify photocatalytic
reactors, and many configurations that try to overcome the scaling-up
problems have been suggested. One of them is a monolithic photoreactor,
which provides a higher surface area per volume than a flat plate
configuration. Systems using monoliths can also be operated at higher
flow rates while causing only minimal hydraulic resistance compared
with systems using packed beds, and they are easier to scale up.11 However, light attenuation along the length
of the channels is severe due to the thick, opaque walls of the monoliths.
Other research groups suggested the use of microreactors,12,13 which not only provide high surface area per volume but also allow
rapid heat and mass transfer due to their small size. It is usually
mentioned that microreactors can be scaled up by increasing the number
of reactors. However, the equipment cost in such numbered-up systems
would be high. As mentioned, there are still many possibilities to
improve the systems for photocatalytic treatment.

Previously,
our research group has succeeded in the synthesis of
monoliths having straight micrometer-sized channels, called microhoneycombs,
by using ice crystals as a template,14 and
the use of such monolithic microhoneycombs as sorbents,15,16 ion-exchange resins,17 as well as catalysts18−20 has been suggested. In photocatalytic applications, the monolith
itself can be thought as a combination of a monolithic reactor and
a microreactor. The thinner walls of microhoneycombs are also thought
to be beneficial for radiative transport due to their higher transparency.
The previous work by Nishihara et al.21 has suggested the use of TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs
as a photocatalyst because this binary sol system is easier for morphology
control, and samples with high specific surface area (higher than
500 m2 g–1) can be obtained. It was found
that microhoneycomb samples performed better than plate-type photocatalysts
in degradation of salad oil in a batch system. However, activity evaluation
of such microhoneycombs for photocatalytic reaction in a continuous
flow system has not been conducted.

In this work, we developed
a synthesis method for TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs
using an inexpensive sodium
silicate solution as the SiO2 source. We have also expanded
the use of TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs
to photocatalytic wastewater treatment in a continuous flow system,
where hydraulic resistance could become an important factor in selecting
the configuration of the photoreactor. Photocatalytic decolorization
of methylene blue (MB), a well-known organic substrate for evaluation
of photocatalytic activity, was used as a model reaction. The effects
of heat treatment, as well as reaction conditions, were studied.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of TiO2–SiO2 Microhoneycombs
It was previously found that the
final morphology of hydrogels
can be controlled by adjusting the firmness of the hydrogel before
unidirectional freezing.22 If the gel is
too soft, a lamella morphology will be obtained. Conversely, if the
gel is too firm, polygonal fibers or powders will be obtained instead
of a microhoneycomb. In this case, where SiO2 is the main
component, the gel firmness (indicated by gelation time) can be adjusted
by adjusting the pH of the final mixture before gelation.23 From Table 1, only the mixtures in the pH range 2.8–3.0
could maintain a monolithic structure. The mixture with 2.5 mol %
TiO2 from TKS-202 and 7.5 mol % TiO2 from TKS-203
gave a final pH of 3, which is similar to that of a SiO2-only sol after ion exchange, and had a narrower gelation time range.
Therefore, this condition was selected for further investigation.

Figure 1a shows
the morphology of a typical TiO2–SiO2 monolith. It can be seen that a microhoneycomb morphology with
channel sizes in the range of 15–40 μm was formed. The
thickness of the walls that surround the channels was up to 5 μm.
The ratio between the coated surface area (in this case, lateral surface
area of the channels) and the volume of the reactor is usually mentioned
in the design of photoreactors.11 In this
work, this ratio was estimated by assuming straight, cylindrical channels
with a diameter of 15 μm, and the number of channels was counted
from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Even by this conservative
estimation, this ratio could reach values higher than 20 000
m2 m–3. Such values are at least an order
of magnitude higher than those of honeycomb photoreactors with larger
channels and are comparable to those of microreactors.11,24−26 Furthermore, the light irradiation experiment shows
that although the light was inevitably attenuated along the length
of the monolith, approximately 5% of the initial intensity could be
detected at the opposite side of the light source. Therefore, it can
be said that the monolith was adequately irradiated.

Figure 1 (a) Morphology and (b)
N2 adsorption isotherm of a typical
uncalcined TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycomb (SBET: 897 m2 g–1). The inset photograph shows visual appearance of the monolith.

The nitrogen adsorption isotherm
of a typical sample (Figure 1b) is of type I,
indicating microporosity. The adsorption at moderate relative pressures
also indicates small mesopores. These small mesopores are essential
for the adsorption of MB and will be discussed later.

The main
purpose of calcination in this work is to improve the
compressive strength of the monoliths. It is shown in Figure 2 that the strength was successfully
increased after calcination due to the condensation of surface silanol
groups and structure densification.27 The
compressive strength could be increased to be higher than that of
a SiO2-only monolith (1.1 × 104 kg m–2)28 after calcination at
temperatures higher than 800 °C. However, it was found that both
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume
decreased with increasing calcination temperature, especially after
calcination at 1000 °C, where the obtained samples became almost
nonporous. This decrease in surface area usually occurs after calcination
due to pore collapsing. A high surface area of more than 500 m2 g–1 could still be maintained even after
calcination at 800 °C, so it is still acceptable to calcine the
monoliths up to this temperature.

Figure 2 Compressive strength and porous properties
of TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs calcined
at various temperatures (data point
for uncalcined sample is shown at 25 °C). X0.15 denotes the uptake ratio of H2O and N2 adsorption at the relative pressure of 0.15.29 Note that the adsorption capacity of samples calcined at
1000 °C was too low to obtain a reliable uptake ratio.

It is also known that the hydrophilicity
of both TiO2 and SiO2 will change after calcination
due to deliberation
of water from surface hydroxyl groups. Water vapor adsorption is a
useful technique to determine this hydrophilicity. The uptake ratio
of water vapor to nitrogen at the relative pressure of 0.15 has been
mentioned as a “hydrophilicity index” for zeolites,29 as well as porous carbons,20 and was used in this work. Figure 2 shows that the hydrophilicity of the samples
remained relatively unchanged (X0.15:
0.50–0.65) after calcination at up to 600 °C; then, the
samples became significantly more hydrophobic (X0.15: 0.18) after calcination at 800 °C. This change in
hydrophobicity is expected to affect the adsorption of MB, which could
also affect the apparent photocatalytic activity. It should be noted
that the adsorption capacity of samples calcined at 1000 °C was
too low to obtain a reliable uptake ratio (adsorption capacity of
nitrogen: 22.3 cm3 (STP) g–1 at relative
pressure of 0.15).

The crystalline phase of TiO2 determines
the photocatalytic
activity of the samples. It is known that anatase TiO2 transforms
into stable rutile after calcination at temperatures over 400 °C.30−32 Rutile is generally considered as a less photoactive phase than
anatase;31 therefore, it is necessary to
avoid phase transformation during calcination. Figure 3 shows that phase change of TiO2 to rutile occurred after calcination at 1000 °C. At this temperature,
the peak of anatase became sharper, indicating aggregation of TiO2 particles. Judging from porous properties and crystalline
data, calcination at 1000 °C should be avoided.

patterns of 10 mol % TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs,
before and after calcination.

Hydraulic Resistance
The hydraulic resistance of a
typical microhoneycomb sample was determined by measuring the pressure
drop, which occurs when water was flowed through an uncalcined monolith.
As shown in Figure 4, the pressure drop that occurs across the system of a monolithic
microhoneycomb is comparable to a bundle of capillaries with a diameter
of 12 μm. This diameter size is slightly lower than the typical
size of the channels, possibly due to tortuosity. However, it was
confirmed that the pressure drop values are less than a hundredth
of that of packed bed systems with similar diffusion path lengths.
This is in agreement with previous studies.15,18

Figure 4 Pressure
drop of water (27 °C) flowing through a typical TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycomb (19 mm in length, 10.5
mm in diameter) compared with calculated data for multicapillaries
and a packed bed column.

Adsorption and Decolorization of MB
The surface coverage
of MB on TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs was
determined at an equilibrium concentration of 4 μmol L–1. Due to the relatively large molecular size of MB (longest dimension:
1.634 nm33), only the surface area of mesopores
(2 nm and larger) is included in the calculation. From Figure 5, samples with a relatively
higher hydrophilicity (calcination temperature up to 600 °C)
showed slight increase in surface coverage with increasing calcination
temperature. Because of this increase in coverage at relatively constant
hydrophilicity, the conversion of MB reached a maximum at a calcination
temperature of 600 °C. Although samples calcined at 800 °C
have significantly higher surface coverage (0.14 nm–2 compared with about 0.05 nm–2) as the hydrophobicity
of their surfaces is relatively higher, it is more difficult for water
to be adsorbed to such surfaces, leading to a lower production rate
of •OH radicals. The surface area of mesopores was
also significantly lower than that of samples calcined at 600 °C
(114 and 209 m2 g–1, respectively). These
changes in surface properties could possibly be the cause of the decrease
in the apparent photocatalytic activity. Finally, samples calcined
at 1000 °C not only had a significantly lower surface area, but
also contained rutile, which is usually reported as less active than
anatase. Therefore, the conversion of MB dramatically decreased. It
should be noted that samples calcined at 1000 °C were not completely
inactive, but the MB adsorption capacity of them was very low and
the conversion did not rise above 13% even at a low flow rate of 0.2
mL min–1.

Figure 5 Surface coverage (nMB) and conversion
(xMB) of MB over TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs calcined at various temperatures (data point
for uncalcined sample is shown at 25 °C). Only the surface area
of mesopores was considered in calculation of surface coverage.

Figure 6 compares
the concentration change with time on stream between a system using
an uncalcined monolith and a system using a monolith calcined at 600
°C. During a few minutes after turning on the light source, a
sudden increase of the MB concentration in the outlet flow was observed
in the system using an uncalcined monolith. This immediate desorption
can be considered as a result of the change in adsorption behavior
of the sample under irradiation.34 The
system using a calcined monolith did not show such a sudden increase
probably because of its higher activity discussed earlier. Both systems
reached a steady state after 4 h. The quantum efficiency is defined
as the ratio between the number of molecules transformed and the number
of photons interacted with the samples. The value estimated for the
most active samples (calcined at 600 °C) was 0.83%. This value
is similar to the values reported in the literature for degradation
of MB.35,36

Figure 6 Concentration of MB with time on stream from
the outlet of TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs,
uncalcined or calcined
at 600 °C (feed concentration: 4 μmol L–1; light intensity: 10 W m–2; superficial velocity:
0.76 cm min–1). Dashed lines are included as a visual
guide for steady-state concentration. Immediate surge in MB concentration
after turning on the light source was possibly due to the change in
adsorption behavior after irradiation.34

Although samples calcined at 600
°C performed the best in
terms of photocatalytic activity alone, samples calcined at 800 °C
may also be used in conditions requiring a high compressive strength.
Therefore, it is possible to tune the strength and the activity of
TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs to fit process
demands.

Photocatalytic activity of the uncalcined microhoneycombs
was also
compared with that of a packed bed of particles. The particles used
in this packed bed were made from crushed uncalcined microhoneycombs;
therefore, apart from different morphology, the porous properties
of the samples in both systems are exactly the same. To avoid fluidization,
the flow rate was set to 0.2 mL min–1. It was found
that the conversion achieved using a packed bed was quite similar
to that achieved using a monolith (0.71 and 0.60, respectively). However,
if the packed bed system was not properly set up, the conversion could
drop to as low as 0.2 due to nonuniform flow and partial fluidization.
This maldistribution can be observed even when quartz wool was placed
under the bed to increase the uniformity of the flow (Figure 7). The problems from flow distribution
could be avoided in a monolithic system. It was observed that the
fluid flow was still well distributed inside the monolith even though
the feed flow could contact only a part of the cross section and the
steady-state conversion could be maintained for more than 40 h. This
highlights the ease of sample handling when monolithic samples were
used.

(left) and a monolithic microhoneycomb (right).

Conclusions
In this work, TiO2–SiO2 monolithic
photocatalysts with a microhoneycomb morphology were synthesized from
inexpensive precursors by applying the ice templating method. The
straight macropores in the samples not only minimized the pressure
drop across the continuous flow system, but also helped in distributing
the feed flow across the monolith while retaining a conversion comparable
to that of a system using a packed bed of particles. Calcination of
synthesized samples at 600–800 °C resulted in samples
with improved compressive strengths and higher photocatalytic activities
of MB, while keeping high specific surface areas. These results indicate
that TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycomb photocatalysts
have the potential to be used for wastewater treatment in continuous
flow systems.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Sodium
silicate solution (assay 52.0–57.0
wt %, SiO2 content 35.0–38.0 wt %, molar ratio (SiO2/Na2O): 2.06–2.31) and 2-methyl-2-propanol
(Special Grade) were purchased from Wako. Ion-exchange resin (Amberlite
IR120B) was supplied by Organo Corp. Two commercial titania sols,
one stabilized using nitric acid (TKS-202, 33 wt % TiO2) and the other in neutral condition (TKS-203, 20 wt % TiO2), were obtained from Tayca. Methylene blue trihydrate (>98.5
wt
%) used as a model substrate was purchased from Kanto Chemical. Azure
A (AA) and Azure B (AB), main intermediates generated during decolorization
of methylene blue, were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (as a chloride salt,
∼80%) and Wako, respectively.

Synthesis of TiO2–SiO2 Microhoneycombs
TiO2–SiO2 microhoneycombs were synthesized
according to the method previously reported,37 but with addition of TiO2 sol. A sodium silicate solution
was diluted by distilled water so that the concentration of SiO2 became 1.9 mol L–1. Then, sodium ions were
removed by addition of an ion-exchange resin to obtain SiO2 sol at pH 3. To this freshly prepared SiO2 sol, acidic
TiO2 sol (TKS-202) was added and mixed vigorously in a
planetary centrifugal mixer (AR-100, Thinky) at 2000 rpm for 3 min.
Neutral TiO2 sol (TKS-203) was then added to this mixture
by a similar procedure. This order of addition was employed to prevent
the mixture from entering the rapid gelation region of SiO2 sol at pH 4–623 and point of zero
charge of TiO2 at pH 4.2–6.8.38 The TiO2 content from the acidic source was
varied from 2 to 5 mol %, and the content from the neutral source
was added so that the total TiO2 content in the resulting
sample was approximately 10 mol %. The mixture was then poured into
polypropylene tubes (inner diameter: 12 mm; length: 125 mm) and incubated
at 30 °C for gelation and aging. The aging time of the gels before
dipping into a cold bath was set to be half of the gelation time.

Aged gels were then molded into a microhoneycomb morphology by dipping
the tubes containing the hydrogels into a cold bath maintained at
−196 °C at 6 cm h–1 using a modified
micro feeder (JP-N, Furue Science, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Frozen gels were then thawed, cut
to approximately 1 cm in length, and immersed in 2-methyl-2-propanol
at 50 °C for 2 days to exchange the water contained in the structure.
The gels were freeze-dried at −10 °C for 2 days with 4
h prefreezing. Because it is known that addition of a second component
causes the compressive strength of the resulting monolithic microhoneycombs
to decrease,28 the obtained samples were
optionally strengthened by calcination in air at 400–1000 °C.

Characterization
The morphology of synthesized samples
was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5410, JEOL).
The light irradiation through the monoliths was measured by a UV meter
(UV-340, Custom) using a UV light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (LED365-9UV033B,
OptoCode Corp.) as a light source. Compressive strength was measured
using a load cell (EW-12Ki, A&D). The porous properties of the
samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorption (BELSORP-mini, MicrotracBEL)
at −196 °C after pretreating the samples at 250 °C
for 4 h under nitrogen gas flow. Specific surface area was calculated
using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Total
pore volume (Vtotal) and micropore volume
(Vmicro) were calculated from the adsorption
capacity at relative pressure values of 0.98 and 0.15, respectively.
Mesopore volume (Vmeso) was calculated
by subtracting Vmicro from Vtotal. In addition, surface area of mesopores was calculated
by the grand canonical Monte Carlo method, assuming heterogeneous
oxygeneous surface with cylindrical pores. To determine surface hydrophilicity,
water vapor adsorption (BELSORP-Max, MicrotracBEL) was conducted at
25 °C. Crystal structure of TiO2 was verified by X-ray
diffraction (XRD, RINT-UltimaIV, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation
(wavelength: 0.15405 nm). Pressure drop across a monolith fixed in
a heat shrink FEP tube (FEP-100, AS ONE, inner diameter: 12 mm) was
measured by a pressure indicator (PZ-200, Copal Electronics). Water
at 27 °C was used as the testing fluid at a flow rate of 0.1–10
mL min–1. The values were compared with calculated
values for multicapillaries having straight channels with circular
cross section (Hagen–Poiseuille equation) and a packed bed
(Kozeny–Carman equation, assuming particle size of 5 μm,
void fraction of 0.4, and shape factor of 1).

MB adsorption
capacity was determined by batch adsorption at 25 °C. The solution
before and after adsorption was collected and analyzed using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (UV-2400PC, Shimadzu) at the wavelength range 250–800
nm.

Photocatalytic Reaction in a Continuous Flow System
Photocatalytic activity of synthesized samples was measured using
the decolorization of MB as a model reaction in a system shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. A microhoneycomb
sample was fixed in a heat shrink tube, and a rubber cap was inserted
to one side of the tube. Aqueous solution of MB was continuously fed
to the bottom of the sample in dark condition for 24 h using an HPLC
pump (PU-2080, Jasco) to assure adsorption equilibrium. Then, a UV
LED lamp used as the light source was turned on. Liquid overflow was
collected in a 3 mL holdup cap and sampled for analysis by a UV–visible
spectrophotometer. Because it is known that photocatalytic degradation
of MB generates demethylated intermediates, which also show light
absorption in the visible region, which overlaps with that of MB,39 it is necessary to separate the peaks from MB
peak to correctly determine the conversion of MB. The procedure for
peak deconvolution is described in the Supporting Information.
