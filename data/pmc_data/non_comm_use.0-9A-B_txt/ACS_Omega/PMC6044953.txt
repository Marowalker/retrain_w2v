In
the many published theories on the retention in reversed-phase
chromatography (RPC), the focus is generally on the effect of the
concentration of the mobile phase modulator(s), although temperature
is known to have a significant influence both on the retention and
on the selectivity between the adsorbates. The aim of this study was
to investigate and model the combined effects of the temperature and
the modulator concentrations on RPC of three insulin variants. KCl
and ethanol were used as mobile phase modulators, and the experiments
were performed on two different adsorbents, with C18 and
C4 ligands. The temperature dependence was investigated
for the interval 10–40 °C and at two different concentrations
of each modulator. The model is derived from the expression for the
adsorption equilibrium, which assumes that ethanol is adsorbed to
the ligands and displaced by the insulin molecules, similar to the
displacement of counterions in the steric mass-action model for ion-exchange
chromatography. A good model fit to the new linear-range retention
data was achieved by only adding and calibrating three parameters
for the temperature dependence of the equilibrium. We found that a
lower temperature results in a longer retention time for all adsorbates,
adsorbents, and modulator concentrations used in this study, indicating
that the adsorption process is enthalpy-driven. A comparison of the
different contributions to the temperature dependence revealed that
the large contribution from the equilibrium constant is dampened by
the significant contributions of the opposite sign from the changes
in activity coefficients of insulins and ethanol. Neglect of these
effects when comparing different adsorbents and modulators might yield
incorrect conclusions because the equilibrium constant varies with
both, whereas the activity coefficients should be independent of the
adsorbent. As expected, the conditions that promote higher retention
also give a higher selectivity between the adsorbates. Nonetheless,
in relation to its effect on the retention, the influence of the KCl
concentration on the selectivity was significantly stronger than that
of the temperature or that of the ethanol concentration.

1 Introduction
As concluded for hydrophobic
interaction chromatography (HIC) by
Vailaya and Horváth 20 years ago1 and for reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) by Pappa-Louisi et al.
8 years ago,2 studies on the effects on
retention have generally been focused on the mobile phase composition,
that is, the concentration of salt and/or organic modulator. This
is still true, with relatively few investigations of the effect of
temperature on retention in these hydrophobicity-based chromatographic
systems to be found in the literature, although it has been recognized
as having an important influence on the resolution.3 Vailaya and Horváth1 present
a thermodynamic analysis of the effect of temperature on retention
in HIC and suggest how nonlinear van’t Hoff plots for a number
of amino acids can be described by the changes in heat capacity, enthalpy,
and entropy. By applying the solvophobic theory, they also relate
the temperature effects on the retention of some hydrocarbons to physical
properties such as surface tension and nonpolar surface area. Dias-Cabral
et al. have performed a similar study regarding the effects of temperature
and salt concentration on HIC of bovine serum albumin,4 in which nonlinear van’t Hoff plots were also observed.
However, most studies of the effect of temperature on retention and
selectivity in RPC seem to focus on small molecules.2,5−10 Hearn and co-workers have published a number of comprehensive studies
of the thermodynamics behind the temperature dependence of the retention
of polypeptides on RPC adsorbents using methanol or acetonitrile as
a mobile phase modulator,11−13 but similar studies of proteins
with ethanol as a modulator have not been found in the literature.
The few studies of the influence of temperature on retention14,15 and selectivity16 of insulin in RPC that
were found were performed with the abovementioned modulators.

In all of the studies mentioned above, the effect of temperature
on retention has been attributed to the changes in the equilibrium
constant, which have been translated to variations in the changes
in Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The values of these might
have been over- or underestimated because possible effects of temperature
on the activity coefficients of the modulators and adsorbates have
not been investigated. If the aim is to only investigate the temperature
dependence of the retention, this is more or less irrelevant. However,
if the combined effect of the temperature and modulator concentrations
is to be modeled, discrimination between the influence on the equilibrium
constant and that on the activity coefficients is important. The equilibrium
constant is, per definition, unaffected by changes in concentrations,
but it varies with the temperature, whereas the activity coefficients
are both concentration- and temperature-dependent. Possible synergy
effects on the activity coefficients will be missed if the influence
of the temperature is neglected. Additionally, correct comparison
of different systems requires separation of the effects on the equilibrium
constant and those on the activity coefficients because the former
is affected by changes of both adsorbents and modulators, whereas
the latter depends only on the modulators. Consequently, we have chosen
another approach.

This paper presents a continuation of our
previous studies,17,18 in which the effects of dual
modulators, ethanol and KCl, on RPC
of three insulin variants were investigated and modeled. Here, we
have studied the different temperature dependencies of the same process
and expanded our model to account for these, within the temperature
interval 10–40 °C. The study includes both linear-range
and high-load data, and the model can be used for both equilibrium
calculations and dynamic simulations. As in the previous study, independent
data, for example, vapor–liquid equilibrium data for the water–ethanol
system, have been used to separate different effects on the retention.
The main aim was to investigate the combined effects of modulator
concentrations and temperature on the retention of and selectivity
between the three insulin variants as well as to develop a model that
describes these effects well.

1.1 Theoretical Basis
The model used
in this study is a new version of one that was presented in a previous
study by the same authors.17 It has now
been further developed to include the effect of temperature. The derivation
is based on the assumption that the chromatographic retention is caused
by adsorption, and not partitioning, of the substances to be separated.

1.1.1 Adsorption Equilibrium
The organic
modulator is assumed to have a dual effect on the adsorption equilibrium:
(1) The stationary phase is initially saturated with the organic modulator,
which is displaced when the protein is adsorbed and, in turn, causes
desorption of the protein by displacing it. Changes in the concentration
of the modulator affect its activity coefficient and thereby the adsorption
equilibrium. (2) Similarly, the activity coefficient of the protein
changes with the modulator concentration. The adsorption mechanism
is given by eq 1 1  where P, M, and L denote the protein, the
organic modulator, and the ligand, respectively. ν is the stoichiometric
coefficient between the ligand and the protein, that is, the number
of ligands that bind to one protein molecule, and ξ is the number
of organic-modulator molecules that bind to one ligand. The equilibrium
constant (K) for the adsorption process described
by eq 1 is given by the
first part of eq 2. The
second part defines the thermodynamic retention factor A, which is a measure of retention and equal to the initial slope
of the adsorption isotherm. 2  cP and qP are the equilibrium concentrations of protein
in the mobile and stationary phases, respectively. x is the molar fraction and γ is the activity coefficient, both
of the species indicated by the index. With the assumptions made in
the previous study17—constant ratio
between the activity coefficients of the ligand complexes and constant
total molarity (ctot) of the mobile phase—the
thermodynamic retention factor of adsorbate i on
adsorbent j (Ai,j) is given by eq 3. 3  

The contribution
of each term to the
variation of ln(Ai,j) with temperature, for the calibrated model, is
shown in Figure 2.
Two of the terms describe the effects of the organic modulator—the
last one, which accounts for the displacement of modulator molecules
when the protein adsorbs, and the third one, which describes the effect
of the concentration of the organic modulator in the mobile phase
on the activity coefficient of the protein (eq 4). 4  

Equation 4 is a simplified
version of Wilson’s equation19 for
the water–ethanol–protein system, assuming infinite
dilution of the protein. EW,M is one of
the binary interaction parameters for the water–ethanol system,
whereas α, ζ, and θ are parameters derived from
the corresponding parameters for the water–ethanol–desB30
insulin system. The temperature dependence of the binary interaction
parameters is given by eq 5, where vi is the molar
volume of species i and ΔUi,j is a parameter that
describes the effect of temperature on the binary parameter Ei,j. 5  

The second term in eq 3 is a salting-in potential, which describes
the effect of the modulator
salt on the activity coefficient of adsorbate i and
is given by eq 6. 6  NA is
Avogadro’s
number, εD is the permittivity of the mobile phase, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute
temperature, and F is Faraday’s number. zi is the charge of adsorbate i, and N is the number of adsorbates. κ
is the inverse of the Debye length and is proportional to the ionic
strength. At a high protein load, the effects of the charges on κ
and of the dipole moments on the last term in eq 6 of the macroions are included, but these
are neglected at a low load (as in the study by Mollerup et al.20). ψi, denoted
(ητ2)i in our previous
paper,17 is a parameter linked to the dipole
moment and size of adsorbate i. ψi varies with the mobile phase permittivity and thus
with both ethanol content and temperature.

The first term in eq 3 is a lumped parameter
that contains a number of parameters that
are or are assumed to be constants, for example, the ligand density,
the ratio between the activity coefficients of the adsorbed species,
and the equilibrium constant for the adsorption of adsorbate i on adsorbent j (Ki,j). The temperature dependence
of the equilibrium constant (eq 7) can be derived from that of the change in Gibbs free energy
upon adsorption (ΔGi,j). 7  

If the changes in enthalpy (ΔHi,j) and entropy (ΔSi,j) upon
adsorption vary insignificantly with temperature, ln(Ki,j) is linearly dependent
on the inverse of the temperature. Possible effects of variations
in the column pressure drop and effects of temperature on ΔHi,j and ΔSi,j can be
included by expansion of ΔHi,j and insertion of the heat capacity correlations,1 respectively.

1.1.2 Dynamic
Chromatography Model
For
the dynamic simulations, the reaction-dispersive model21 was applied (eq 8). The column packing is assumed to be homogenous,
and all physical properties are considered isotropic. Possible radial
concentration and temperature gradients are also neglected. The factor
in front of the adsorption term is the ratio between the fraction
of pore volume accessible to adsorbate i and the
total column porosity (εt,i) because
the adsorption and the extraparticle transport are defined for the
corresponding volumes, respectively. 8  t and z are
the temporal and spatial coordinates, counting from the start of the
chromatographic run and the column inlet, respectively. ci is the concentration of adsorbate i in the mobile phase, and qi is the corresponding concentration in the stationary
phase. εc and εp are the interstitial
and particle porosities, respectively, and kD,i is the exclusion factor
for species i. Dapp is
the apparent axial dispersion coefficient, and vsup is the superficial linear velocity of the mobile phase.
It was assumed that eq 9 can be used for estimation of Dapp,
although it is intended for Dax, and that
the Péclet number (Ped) based on the diameter of the adsorbent particles (dp) was 0.5. 9  

This is a rough estimation, but as
mentioned previously, our focus is on the equilibrium and not on the
kinetics. All effects of the temperature on the kinetics are attributed
to the changes in the kinetic constant for the adsorption reaction.
The adsorption model used in this study is given by eq 10, where kkin is the kinetic constant for the adsorption reaction, N is the number of adsorbate types, and σ is the shielding
factor. 10  

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Methods
The experiments
in this study were performed in accordance with our two previous studies,17,18 but at other concentrations of KCl and ethanol and at varying temperatures.
Thus, the method is only described shortly here, and the reader is
referred to the two previous publications for details.

All experiments
were performed on an ÄKTA pure 25 chromatography system from
GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden) with a U9-M UV monitor. Sample injection
was performed with a 50 mL superloop from the same manufacturer and
an ALIAS autosampler from Spark Holland BV (Emmen, The Netherlands)
for the high-load and linear-range experiments, respectively. The
columns were placed inside a ThermaSphere model TS-430 column oven
(Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) and equipped with a 2 mL precolumn
metal tubing, to ensure isothermal conditions. Two different RPC adsorbents
(silica backbone) from Novo Nordisk Pharmatech A/S (Køge, Denmark)
were used: one with C18 ligands and one with C4 ligands. Prepacked steel columns (inner diameter 10 mm and length
100 mm) with these adsorbents were purchased from Dr. Maisch HPLC
GmbH (Ammerbuch–Entringen, Germany).

Three different
human insulin variants (insulin aspart, desB30
insulin, and an insulin ester) were kindly provided by Novo Nordisk
A/S (Bagsværd, Denmark). These were chosen because they are very
similar in size, shape, and chemical composition—each has one
modification compared to human insulin but still differ in pI and
hydrophobicity (Table 1), and because they are industrially relevant.

(GRAVY)	
insulin aspart	4.8	0.177	
desB30 insulin	5.3	0.213	
insulin ester	5.3	0.231	
All experiments were performed at isocratic and isothermal
conditions,
and the mobile phase flow rates were 3.0 and 1.0 mL/min for the linear-range
and high-load experiments, respectively. The lower flow rate at a
high load was due to the pressure restrictions for the superloop.
A set point with respect to modulator concentrations was chosen at
0.4 mol KCl/kg and 28.4 and 25.6 wt % ethanol for the experiments
on the C18 and C4 columns, respectively. Two
other mobile phase compositions were used: (1) one with less KCl (0.1
mol/kg) and (2) one with less ethanol (27.5 and 24.7 wt % for the
C18 and C4 columns, respectively). All other
experimental conditions remained unchanged. The pH of the elution
buffers was 7.5.

All three insulin variants were used for the
linear-range experiments,
whereas only desB30 insulin was used for the high-load experiments.
For the linear-range experiments, the total protein load was kept
below 0.03 g/L column, whereas two different load levels were applied
for each temperature in the high-load experiments: 12 and 1.2 g of
desB30 insulin/L column. The linear-range experiments at the set point
cover the temperature range 10–40 °C, with a step of 6
°C, whereas the additional linear-range and high-load experiments
were performed at 16, 25, and 34 °C.

2.2 Modeling
2.2.1 Assumptions, Correlations, and Literature
Data
The interstitial, particle, and total porosities for
the two columns used in this study were determined previously.17 The mobile phase density was estimated using
the correlation by Galleguillos et al.22 for mixtures of water, ethanol, and KCl. This correlation does not
include the effect of temperature, but parameters are given for 25
and 40 °C. On the basis of the slight difference in data for
these two temperatures observed in that study,22 we used the two parameter sets and applied linear interpolation
and extrapolation for the temperature intervals 25–40 and 10–25
°C, respectively.

Any effects of KCl on the permittivity
of the mobile phase were assumed to be negligible, and the correlations
for water–ethanol mixtures at different temperatures by Akerlof23 were applied. Linear interpolation was used
for ethanol concentrations between the levels for which parameter
values are given in the paper by Akerlof.23

Using the molar volumes of water (18.069 cm3/mol)
and
ethanol (58.620 cm3/mol) at 25 °C, ΔUM,W and ΔUW,M were estimated to 3670.3 and 487.2 J/(mol·K), respectively,
from the vapor–liquid equilibrium data24 used in our previous paper.17 As in that
paper, vapor pressures of pure components from the DIPPR 801 Database25 and the modified Raoult’s law, including
activity coefficients, were used for the estimation.

2.2.2 Temperature Dependence of Model Terms
Apart from the
temperature dependence of eq 6 and that of the Debye length, density, and
permittivity of the mobile phase, temperature should not affect the
salting-in tendency. A change in the conformation of the adsorbates
due to the temperature variations could alter the dipole moment and
size of the insulin molecules, but because no maximum in retention
was observed, this is not likely to occur.13,26 Consequently, we have chosen to assume that these adsorbate properties
are constant enough not to cause any significant variations in the
value of the parameter ψi with temperature.

α is a lumped parameter, including binary interaction parameters
for the water–ethanol–insulin system, and should thus
have a temperature dependence similar to that of those parameters.
Consequently, a modified version of eq 5, using the value at 22 °C (Tref) as a reference (αref), was applied
for this parameter (eq 11). 11  

In analogy with the assumption of α
having the same value
for all three insulin variants in our previous study,17 the same assumption was made for the temperature-dependence
parameter ΔUα. The main temperature
dependence of A0,i,j′ (eq 7) should be due to that
of Kij. Estimations using
the change in molar volume when insulin is adsorbed to an RPC adsorbent14 revealed that the relatively low column pressure
drops observed in this study (below 20 bar) would only affect ln(A) by 1% or less. Although the van’t Hoff plots (ln(A) vs 1/T) showed signs of slight curvature,
the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon adsorption were assumed to
be temperature-independent, and A0,i,j′ was assumed to vary with temperature, as described
by eq 12. 12  ΔHi,j′ and ΔSi,j′ are
lumped parameters because A0,i,j′ might contain other effects of temperature than that on the adsorption
equilibrium constant.

2.2.3 Calibration of a Linear-Range
Equilibrium
Model
The parameters of unknown value for the linear-range
equilibrium model are ΔUα,
ΔHi,j′, and ΔSi,j′. These three properties
are the only parameters in the equilibrium model that were calibrated
against the chromatographic data obtained in this study. As mentioned
above, the density and permittivity of the mobile phase and the parameters
for the temperature dependence of Wilson’s equation (ΔUM,W and ΔUW,M) were determined from literature data or correlations. All other
parameters have the values that were determined in our previous study.17 ΔUα describes
the mobile phase properties and is thus adsorbent-independent but
has also been assumed to be adsorbate-independent. The other two parameters
are both adsorbent- and adsorbate-specific because they describe the
interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent. With ΔUα being a global parameter for the two adsorption
systems studied, simultaneous calibration of the model for all adsorbates
and adsorbents was required. The retention volumes were determined
from the first moment of each peak, after chromatogram decomposition
using the MATLAB function Peak Fitter from MATLAB Central. More details
about the method can be found in one of our previous papers.18 The thermodynamic retention factor was calculated
from the experimental results using eq 13, and calibration was performed with the MATLAB function lsqcurvefit. lsqcurvefit is a least-squares
Gauss–Newton method for nonlinear curve fitting. 13  VR,i and VNR,i are
the retention and nonretained volumes for adsorbate i, respectively, and Vcol is the total
column volume.

2.2.4 Calibration of a High-Load
Dynamic Model
The partial differential equation (eq 8) was converted to a set
of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) by discretization, using the finite volume method, and the
resulting ODEs were solved by the MATLAB function ode15s. For this study, a two-point backward approximation
was used for the first-order derivative in the convection term and
a three-point centered approximation was used for the second-order
derivative in the dispersion term. The column axis was divided into
100 grid points.

The capacity parameters Λj and vi,j should not be affected by temperature unless the
conformation of the insulin variants is drastically altered, which
is assumed not to be. Because the viscosity of the mobile phase increases
considerably with decreasing temperature, the mass transfer should
be significantly slower at lower temperatures. For the reaction-dispersive
model, the effects of mass transfer to and inside the adsorbent particles
are lumped with the dispersion in Dapp and with the adsorption kinetics in kkin. A change in the value of either of these two parameters affects
the peak shape in the same way. As the dispersion is unaffected by
the temperature, whereas kkin should increase
exponentially with temperature, the influence of temperature on the
peak shape was attributed to the latter. The same type of correlation
as applied to α (eq 11) was used to model this effect, with the value calibrated
for 22 °C17 as a reference. Manual
calibration was applied; that is, the parameter values were iteratively
adjusted after comparison between the simulated chromatograms and
the experimental ones.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Linear-Range Equilibrium
As shown
in Figure 1, the retention
of all three insulin variants increases with decreasing temperature,
for all mobile phase compositions applied in this study. This temperature
dependence is more or less the opposite of what was reported for another
set of insulin variants on a C8 adsorbent, using acetonitrile
as a mobile phase modulator, by Szabelski et al.14 Additionally, the van’t Hoff plots in that study
were concave, whereas ours (not included) were slightly convex. This
demonstrates the possibility to totally alter the adsorption properties
by changing modulators. Similar effects on other adsorbates when changing
from acetonitrile to methanol as an organic modulator have been reported
from other studies.11,27 Unfortunately, no study of the
temperature effect on the retention of insulin variants using ethanol
as a mobile phase modulator was found in the literature. Although
the van’t Hoff plots for our data are slightly convex, there
are not any extrema, which supports the assumption that the conformation
of the insulin variants does not change with temperature.11 This assumption is further supported by the
lack of signs of peak splitting16,28 and the relatively
smooth trends in selectivity16 shown in Figure 3.

Figure 1 Comparison of linear-range
retention data and model response for
(a) insulin aspart, (b) desB30 insulin, and (c) insulin ester on the
C18 (filled markers and solid lines) and C4 (open
markers and dashed lines) adsorbents.

Another interesting observation, which is not related to
the temperature
dependence but is clearly shown in Figure 1, is that the relative effects of the modulators
change gradually with increasing hydrophobicity of the adsorbates.
For the least retained adsorbate, insulin aspart (Figure 1a), the reductions of the concentration
of KCl and ethanol, respectively, have approximately the same effect.
For the most retained adsorbate, the insulin ester (Figure 1c), the reduction of the concentration
of KCl has a considerably larger effect, and the intermediately retained
adsorbate, desB30 insulin (Figure 1b), shows an intermediary behavior.

There is
a good agreement between model and reality (Figure 1), and the model describes
the trends with temperature, modulator concentrations, adsorbates,
and adsorbents very well. Some discrepancies were anticipated because
the parameters for the effects of KCl and ethanol were calibrated
against another set of experimental data, produced with other columns
packed with the same adsorbents. The assumption of no conformational
changes reduced the complexity of the salting-in potential (eq 6). As shown in Figure 1, the effect of the
KCl concentration is very well-described by the simplified model,
indicating that neither the size nor the dipole moment of the insulin
variants is likely to change due to the conformational changes.

The benefit of using the values of A, and not
ln(A), for the calibration of the model parameters
is that the emphasis is on the longer retention times, where the precision
is higher. This approach was chosen to make the calibration more robust
with respect to experimental errors. The calibrated parameter values
are found in Table 2.

As seen in both Figure 1 and Table 2, temperature has a larger effect on the retention on the
C4 adsorbent, and the effect also increases concomitantly
with the
hydrophobicity of the adsorbates. This difference is, however, rather
small, which is reflected by the similarities in parameter values
for the two adsorbents. The confidence intervals confirm that all
parameters are statistically significant, and the uncertainties for
ΔHi,j′ and ΔSi,j′ (13–20%) are reasonable,
especially considering the limited number of data points for each
mobile phase composition. The uncertainty for ΔUα (77%) is very high, probably because the temperature
dependence of the activity coefficients of ethanol and of the insulin
variants affect ln(A) in a similar way (Figure 2, yellow and purple markers). This could probably be partially
redeemed by the use of supplementary solubility data for insulin as
a function of temperature, similar to the approach used in our previous
study.17 However, attempts to attain such
data were futile because no dissolved insulin could be detected at
25 °C, despite several reruns of experiments and analyses, and
inconsistent observations were made at higher temperatures.

Figure 2 Contribution
to the variation in ln(A) with temperature
from the temperature-dependent terms in eq 3 according to the calibrated model. The model
responses for the C18 (filled markers) and C4 (open markers) adsorbents, respectively, at the set-point conditions
are shown.

Because ΔHi,j′ and
ΔSi,j′ are lumped parameters,
it is not possible to draw any quantitative conclusions regarding
the temperature dependence of ΔGi,j. It is, however, unlikely that
the influence of temperature on any of the other lumped parameters
is larger than that on the equilibrium constant. Consequently, the
qualitative conclusion that the changes in both enthalpy and entropy
are negative seems reasonable. This means that the last term on the
right-hand side of eq 14 is positive for all (feasible) temperatures and increases concomitantly
with the temperature. The lower the value of ΔG, the stronger the adsorption; that is, the negative value of ΔH provides the driving force for the adsorption. The adsorption
is thus enthalpy-driven, and the retention decreases with increasing
temperature because the change in Gibbs free energy increases (eq 14). 14  

The temperature dependence
of the linear-range retention in chromatography
is generally solely attributed to that of the adsorption equilibrium
constant, the natural logarithm of which is proportional to the changes
in Gibbs free energy and in turn to the changes in the enthalpy and
entropy. This might, however, result in an over- or underestimation
of the influence of temperature on the adsorption equilibrium because
the values of the activity coefficients of the involved species (in
this case, the insulin variants and ethanol) can vary significantly
with temperature. It is important to separate the temperature effects
on the equilibrium constant from those on the activity coefficients
when the modulator concentrations are varied because the former is
concentration-independent, whereas the latter are not. Additionally,
comparison and simultaneous modeling of two or more systems require
discrimination between the behavior related to the modulators and
that related to the adsorbents. For these reasons, the variation with
temperature of the different terms in eq 3, according to the model, was investigated (Figure 2).

Only the
model responses for the set-point conditions, that is,
28.4 and 25.6 wt % ethanol for the C18 and C4 adsorbents, respectively, and 0.4 mol KCl/kg, are shown in Figure 3, but the results for the other mobile phase compositions
applied in this study were very similar. The calculations reveal that
the effect of temperature on ln(A0′), and thereby on ΔG, is almost three times as large as that on ln(A). The salting-in term gives a positive and concave, but
negligible, contribution to the temperature dependence of ln(A), whereas the contributions from the two terms describing
the effects of the ethanol concentration (yellow and purple markers)
are significant, approximately linear and negative.

on selectivity between (a) desB30 insulin
and insulin aspart and that between (b) the insulin ester and desB30
insulin on the C18 (filled symbols) and C4 (open
symbols) adsorbents.

3.2 Selectivity
Because of the interesting
synergy effects of temperature, modulator concentrations, and type
of adsorbent on the retention indicated in Figure 1, the selectivity between insulin aspart
and desB30 insulin (Figure 3a) and that between desB30 insulin and the insulin ester (Figure 3b) were calculated.

Independently of the experimental conditions, the selectivity between
both sets of adsorbates decreases with increasing temperature (Figure 3), with a possible
exception for that between insulin aspart and desB30 insulin at 0.1
mol KCl/kg on the C4 adsorbent (Figure 3a). It seems, however, more plausible that
the data point at 16 °C is an outlier. The C18 adsorbent
has a considerably higher selectivity than the C4 adsorbent,
for the same temperature and KCl concentration, and ethanol concentrations
that give comparable retention times. A higher selectivity is achieved
for lower concentrations of KCl and ethanol, which is consistent with
our previous findings.18 Compared to the
corresponding influence on the retention, the KCl concentration has
a considerable effect on the selectivity, whereas that of ethanol
only has a minor effect. It is obvious that the selectivity between
insulin aspart and desB30 insulin is more sensitive to both the KCl
concentration and the temperature, whereas that between desB30 insulin
and the insulin ester is almost constant within the studied temperature
interval.

3.3 High-Load Dynamics
Our hypothesis
for the influence of temperature on the high-load experiments was
that apart from the effect on the equilibrium, only the kinetics would
be affected. However, the values of the ligand densities had to be
reduced to 75 and 50% of the previously calibrated values17 for the C18 and C4 adsorbents,
respectively, to achieve a reasonable fit. As shown in Figures 4–6, there is no trend in capacity effects
with temperature, and the reason for the adjustment of Λ has
nothing to do with the temperature. The likely explanations are a
loss of ligands or reduced accessible surface area, caused by wear
of the adsorbents. This might also explain the observed decrease in A0′ at 22 °C, compared to the results from our previous study,17 which is the reason why the calibrated value
from that study was not used as a reference.

Figure 4 Comparison of high-load
experiments (full lines) and simulations
(dashed lines) for (a) the C18 and (b) C4 adsorbents,
at the set-point conditions (0.4 mol KCl/kg and 28.4 or 25.6 wt %
ethanol), using the adjusted values of Λ.

Figure 5 Comparison of high-load experiments (full lines) and simulations
(dashed lines) for (a) the C18 and (b) C4 adsorbents,
at the lower KCl concentration (0.1 mol KCl/kg and 28.4 or 25.6 wt
% ethanol), using the adjusted values of Λ.

Figure 6 Comparison of high-load experiments (full lines) and simulations
(dashed lines) for (a) the C18 and (b) C4 adsorbents,
at the lower ethanol concentration (0.4 mol KCl/kg and 27.5 or 24.7
wt % ethanol), using the adjusted values of Λ.

Regarding the neglect of an effect of possible
conformational changes
on the stoichiometric coefficient ν, the occurrence of conformational
changes could be the cause of the lack of fit at a high load, but
this would also have a very large effect on the influence of the ethanol
content on the retention of the insulins (the last term in eq 3). Because the equilibrium
model describes the effect of ethanol very well (Figure 1), it is not likely that ν
changes with temperature, as a consequence of conformational changes.

The attempts to make kkin temperature-dependent
were futile because it affects the height of the peaks to a much larger
extent than it affects their roundness. A more advanced dynamic model,
that is, a general-rate model, could give rounder peaks but would
likely not give sharp enough fronts at higher temperatures. There
is apparently some additional phenomenon that the model cannot capture,
and further investigation of this is beyond the scope of this study.

Comparison of Figures 4–6 shows that the best fit for
both adsorbents has been achieved at the set-point conditions. At
the other two mobile phase compositions, the fit at the higher load
(12 g/L column) is better for the C4 adsorbent than for
the C18 one, whereas the opposite is true for the lower
load (1.2 g/L column).

4 Conclusions
The
combined effects of temperature and the concentrations of KCl
and ethanol on the separation of three insulin variants on C18 and C4 adsorbents were studied. Our equilibrium and dynamic
models for dual modulators from a previous publication17 were successfully expanded to include the influence
of temperature.

A decrease in the retention with increasing
temperature for all
tested combinations of adsorbates, adsorbents, and mobile phase compositions
was observed. This suggests an enthalpy-driven adsorption process.
The effect of temperature was stronger for the experimental series
performed at lower concentrations of KCl and ethanol, and it also
increased with the hydrophobicity of the adsorbate. A reduction of
the temperature or either modulator concentration resulted in a higher
selectivity. The influence of the KCl concentration, relative to its
effect on the retention, was considerably stronger than those of ethanol
and temperature.

We also found that the increase in ln(A0′) with the
inverse of the temperature is almost three times as fast as that of
ln(A), which is reduced by the simultaneous decrease
in the terms describing the ethanol effect. These results demonstrate
the importance of accounting for the temperature dependence of the
activity coefficients, and not only that of the equilibrium constant,
to enable correct comparison of different adsorbents and modulators.
Only the equilibrium constant changes with the adsorbent, but a change
of modulators also affects the activity coefficients.
