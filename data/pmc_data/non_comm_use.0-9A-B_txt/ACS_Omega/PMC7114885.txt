The production of
fine particles via the supercritical carbon dioxide
(SC–CO2) antisolvent process was carried out. The
experiments were conducted at temperatures of 40–60 °C
and pressures of 8–12 MPa with a 15 mL min–1 carbon dioxide (CO2) and 0.5 mL min–1 feed solution flow rate. As a feed solution, the curcumin and the
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) powder were dissolved in acetone and ethanol
at concentrations of 1.0 mg mL–1 and 2.0–4.0%
in weight, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
described that most of the precipitated particle products have spherical
morphologies with a size of less than 1 μm. The Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra exhibited that the curcumin
structural properties did not shift after the SC–CO2 antisolvent process. Moreover, the PVP addition in the curcumin
particle products can enhance the curcumin dissolution in distilled
water significantly.

Introduction
Curcumin is known as a natural colorant
isolated from the Curcuma longa L.
plant (known as turmeric) where
this rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant was a plant native to
tropical South Asia and nowadays extensively cultivated in the tropical
and subtropical countries. As a major active component of turmeric,
curcumin possesses a low molecular weight polyphenol responsible for
the turmeric color (bright yellow). This compound has been applied
in pharmaceutical applications to process anticarcinogenic, antibacterial,
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal activities.1 Some reports also informed that curcumin has
been applied to treat diverse diseases such as Alzheimer’s
disease, myelodyplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, anti-human immunodeficiency
virus (anti-HIV) cycle replication, and psoriasis.2−4 In spite of
these favors, due to the fact that curcumin consists of a complex
structure and possesses poor solubility in water and high hydrophobicity,
this compound seems to have a rapid systemic elimination, rapid metabolism,
and poor absorption, which can restrict curcumin usage in pharmaceutical
applications and functional food development. Hence, the curcumin
structural modification by using a hydrophilic polymer was required
to improve its solubility and to broaden its utilization in pharmaceutical
and food fields.5,6

In this work, to improve
the solubility of curcumin, especially
in water media, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC–CO2) was employed as a medium to produce fine particles from curcumin,
which is mixed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a hydrophilic polymer
modifier. This polymer, also usually recognized as polyvidone or povidone,
is a water-soluble polymer composed of the monomer, N-vinylpyrrolidone. Due to its chemical and physical properties such
as being nontoxic, physiologically compatible, nonionic, temperature-resistant,
colorless, pH stable, chemically inert, and highly soluble in water,
PVP has been applied in many applications such as pharmaceutical,
cosmetic, and medical applications. It also has been broadly utilized
to encapsulate matrix materials.7 Even
the matrix material encapsulation with PVP may manage the release
rate and improve the encapsulated matrix material solubility.8−12 In other words, PVP is well suited to improve the dissolution rates
of poorly water-soluble drugs in pharmaceutical applications.

A supercritical fluid including SC–CO2 is any
fluid at conditions above its critical point where diverse gas and
liquid phases do not exist. At supercritical conditions, the fluid
possesses liquid-like densities with gas-like transport properties
and moderate solvent power, which can be tuned with turns in temperature
and pressure. Hence, a supercritical fluid has been utilized at diverse
applications, such as chromatography, extractions (separations), or
particle formation.13−16 Several processes for particle generation by using the supercritical
fluid have been proposed where the supercritical fluid performed different
functions. However, there are two common methods to form particles
by using supercritical fluids, mainly SC–CO2: rapid
expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) and supercritical antisolvent
(SAS) methods. In the SAS process, the supercritical fluid was used
as an antisolvent while it became a solvent in the RESS process.17 When the supercritical fluid was employed as
a medium for particle generation, the solute–solvent, usually
an organic solvent, can be eliminated from the precipitated particles
owing to its high solubility in the supercritical fluid. Furthermore,
the utilization of the organic solvent also can be decreased.

Here, SC–CO2 acting as an antisolvent was employed
to produce fine particles from curcumin–PVP that is dissolved
in ethanol–acetone. The curcumin–PVP solution was injected
directly to the SC–CO2 antisolvent system via a
coaxial nozzle. Since the SAS system was particularly proceeded by
the quick mixing between the feed solution and the supercritical fluid
to attain supersaturation to form particles, the mixing of ethanol–acetone
containing curcumin–PVP as a feed solution and SC–CO2 as an antisolvent became one of the important step processes.6,18,19 The coaxial nozzle is known as
the nozzle that consists of two capillary tubes to flow the feed solution
and the SC–CO2 as an antisolvent simultaneously.
By utilizing this device, the agglomeration of precipitated particle
products also can be reduced due to fact that the velocity of two
coaxial flows may be adjusted independently.14,20,21

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the powders of PVP (Figure 1a) and curcumin (Figure 1b) before treatment by the SC–CO2 antisolvent and the collected particle products from curcumin feed
solution without (Figure 1c) and with (Figure 1d) PVP after treatment by the SC–CO2 antisolvent.
It could be seen that the raw materials of curcumin and PVP seem to
have flakes and spherical or wrinkled spherical morphologies, respectively.
Apparently, they have a broad diameter range. It is already known
that SC–CO2 can be applied as a medium to alter
the existing particles, mainly their surface or to produce particles
in the nano- and microscale. To generate a particle, there are two
means: chemical reaction and physical transformation. In the chemical
reaction manner, the SC–CO2 was utilized as a medium
of reaction, while in the physical transformation manner, the existing
method for the formation of particles by using SC–CO2 is frequently classified upon the act of the fluid in the process.
Therefore, when the CO2 was utilized as a solvent in the
supercritical antisolvent, mass transfer has to be a key factor. The
mass transfer occurs between a compressed CO2 as an antisolvent
and an organic solvent droplet from feed solution to generate a particle.6,20−23

Figure 1 (a)
Raw materials of PVP and (b) curcumin and particle products

As shown in Figure 1d, the uniform morphologies of the collected curcumin–PVP
particle products with a narrow diameter range were found after treatment
by the SC–CO2 antisolvent. Their morphologies were
spherical shapes with a size of less than 1 μm. It exhibited
that, as a SC–CO2 antisolvent treatment, the droplet
of feed solution was swelled and stabilized by the surface tension
of acetone–ethanol solvents. Meanwhile, the mass transfer between
the SC–CO2 and acetone–ethanol solvents may
decline these solvent surface tensions that are sufficient to control
the droplet form. On the other hand, the diffusion phenomenon during
the SC–CO2 treatment may also drive the acetone–ethanol
solvents volume from expanding, declining their density, and consequently,
the solvating acetone–ethanol solvents power declines, resulting
in the curcumin–PVP precipitation. Due to this process, at
supercritical conditions, CO2 as an antisolvent may reduce
the size of curcumin–PVP particle products.6,20,21,23,24

On the contrary, the morphology and the size
of the collected particle
products from the curcumin feed solution without PVP addition does
not seem to change after treatment by the SC–CO2 antisolvent (see Figure 1c). They have flake morphologies with a size larger than 1
μm. It seems that the collected particle products from the curcumin
feed solution without PVP underwent agglomeration during the SC–CO2 antisolvent treatment. It indicates that, although the formation
of curcumin particles from curcumin solution with or without PVP addition
by using SC–CO2 antisolvent is in principle the
same process, the addition of biodegradable polymer such as PVP as
a carrier in the curcumin feed solution is a promising way to prevent
particle product agglomeration.25

Figure 2 exhibits
the solubility of curcumin particle products in distilled water at
40 °C and 12 MPa without and with 2% PVP. Obviously, the curcumin
particle products without PVP addition did not dissolve in distilled
water, and conversely, the curcumin particle products with PVP addition
can dissolve completely in distilled water. It is well known that
the solubility of solutes can be improved by the reduction of their
sizes and the encapsulation to modify their surface by using hydrophilic
polymers.26 Here, to reduce the powder
size of curcumin and to encapsulate the curcumin powder, the feed
solution consisting of curcumin and PVP was sprayed via a coaxial
nozzle into the SC–CO2 antisolvent system. Due to
the SC–CO2 antisolvent effect, the smaller particles
of curcumin containing PVP, compared with those of the curcumin raw
material, were obtained via precipitation during the process. At these
conditions, encapsulation of curcumin with PVP may occur and grow
simultaneously to form a particle. In this work, encapsulation was
expressed as the particle formation process from a feed solution consisting
of two substances in the solvent that is injected in the SC–CO2 antisolvent system in which one substance may grow over an
already precipitated substance particle. During the encapsulation
process, the hydrophobic part of PVP may wrap the curcumin, while
at the hydrophilic part of PVP, the hydrogen bonds would be generated.27 As a result, as shown in Figure 2, the encapsulated curcumin particle products
with PVP is completely soluble in distilled water.

particle products at 40 °C and
12 MPa (a) without and with (b) 2% PVP.

To identify the possible shift structure of curcumin or PVP molecules
after treatment by the SC–CO2 antisolvent, the collected
particle products were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy in the
wavelength range from 4000 to 400 cm–1. This analysis
also can observe the possible intermolecular interaction between curcumin
and PVP as a carrier. Curcumin or PVP as a starting material was used
directly as a control to identify the unknown objects and the chemical
bond types of the compounds in those objects. Essentially, the diverse
compounds in a similar organic group can absorb approximately in a
similar spectral range. Hence, curcumin or PVP was also constructed
from many various chemical bonds, which are slightly elastic and may
bend, vibrate, or stretch. Figure 3 describes the FT-IR spectra of raw materials of PVP
(Figure 3a) and curcumin
(Figure 3b) and the
collected particle products from SC–CO2 antisolvent
treatment at 40 °C and 12 MPa without (Figure 3c) and with 2% PVP (Figure 3d). The PVP starting material (Figure 3a) provided an absorption band
at 3410 cm–1, corresponding to the O–H stretching
vibration. The absorption bands at 2960 and 1642 cm–1 confirmed the existence of asymmetric CH2 and C–O
stretching, respectively. The C–H bending and CH2 wagging were noticed at 1423 and 1288 cm–1 absorption
bands, respectively. The absorption bands at 1020 and 571 cm–1 were indicated as the CH2 rocking and N–C=O
bending, respectively.28,29 As illustrated in this figure,
the FT-IR spectra of untreated curcumin (Figure 3b) and treated curcumin without PVP addition
(Figure 3c) by the
SC–CO2 antisolvent were the same. They showed the
characteristic absorption bands at 3512 cm–1 due
to the O–H stretching vibration, at 1627 cm–1 due to C=C benzene stretching ring, at 1509 cm–1 due to C=O stretching, at 1428 cm–1 due
to C–H bending, at 1280 cm–1 due to C–O
stretching, at 1025 cm–1 due to C–O–C
stretching vibration, and at 856 cm–1 due to C–H
aromatic hydrogen. These FT-IR spectra (Figure 3b,c) indicated that the curcumin structure
did not change after SC–CO2 antisolvent treatment
without PVP addition. In the case of the treated curcumin containing
PVP, due to the hydrogen-bond intermolecular interaction between O–H
of curcumin and C=O of PVP, the O–H absorption band
of curcumin completely disappeared and the C=O absorption band
of PVP shifted to a lower intensity. There are no other chemical bonds
in the collected particle products from the feed solution containing
curcumin and PVP after the SC–CO2 antisolvent treatment.
Perhaps it indicated that PVP as a polymer carrier successfully encapsulated
curcumin during the precipitation process.29

In this work, to observe the shifts in the thermal properties
of
curcumin or PVP as a starting material and the collected particle
products after the SC–CO2 antisolvent treatment,
they were characterized by using thermogravimetric analysis, as described
in Figure 4. This analytical
technique can be applied to determine the thermal stability of the
substance, and its fraction of volatile components by observing the
weight shift that occurs as a sample is heated. The weight loss of
sample versus time was recorded, and this weight loss was assumed
to describe the thermal decomposition of curcumin or PVP and the collected
particle products containing them.30 Essentially,
all samples underwent the same decomposition pathway during thermogravimetric
analysis, but the starting temperature of each sample losing weight
seems different. Below 100 °C, generally, the weight loss of
substances can be due to the elimination of the moisture content.
This could be found only in the TGA (thermal gravimetric analysis)
thermogram of PVP, and this might be because PVP is a highly hygroscopic
substance. As described in Figure 4, it can be known that the thermal degradation of curcumin,
PVP, and the collected particle products were initiated at approximately
245, 378, and 275 °C, respectively, and continued by a great
weight loss when the major thermal degradation occurred. The complete
thermal degradation seems to occur at around 480 °C, and there
is essentially no more weight loss above this temperature. Although
the thermal decomposition curves of curcumin, PVP, and the collected
particle products did not result in significant differences, it seems
that the intermolecular interaction between curcumin and PVP can improve
the thermal stability of curcumin via O–H and C=O bond
conjugations.31 This result is in good
agreement with the results given by infrared spectroscopy (see Figure 3).

products at 60 °C and 8 MPa with 4% PVP.

Mostly, in the antisolvent process including SC–CO2 as an antisolvent, the desired substance was dissolved in an organic
solvent to form a solution as a feed solution. The desired substance
should be virtually insoluble in SC–CO2 and vice
versa, and the organic solvent should have relatively high miscibility
in SC–CO2 at the desired operating pressure and
temperature. During the SC–CO2 antisolvent process,
the solvent power of the feed solution was declined by saturating
it with antisolvent, resulting in precipitation of the dissolved substance.
In this work, the contact between the feed solution and the SC–CO2 as an antisolvent was performed at the top of the precipitator
through a coaxial nozzle continuously when the operating condition
achieved a steady state (temperature, pressure, and CO2 flow rate). The SC–CO2 will soon interact and
dissolve into the acetone–ethanol solvent, resulting in curcumin
or curcumin–PVP precipitation. This precipitated particle was
captured and collected on a stainless-steel filter (0.5 mm, SS-4F-K4-05,
Swagelok), which was attached in the end of the precipitator. Table 1 lists the operating
conditions, the precipitation yields, and the curcumin contents collected
from each experiment. The yield of collected particles was determined
as the percentage ratio of the mass of the collected particles to
the initial mass delivered to the precipitator particle product collector
(yield = (mass-collected particles/mass-delivered feed) × 100%),
while the content of curcumin in the collected particles was determined
by dividing the curcumin mass in the analyzed collected particle products
by the total mass of collected particle products. The yield of collected
particles and the content of curcumin in the collected particles ranged
between 53.01–77.19 and 63.37–78.51%, respectively,
depending on the operating conditions operated in the SC–CO2 antisolvent process. De Marco et al.32 conducted an experiment for supercritical antisolvent precipitation
using PVP as a solute and the organic solvent mixture as a solvent.
They reported that the precipitation yields could approach to 90%
when the various acetone–ethanol mixture compositions were
used as a solvent. However, as summarized in Table 1, the results of precipitated particles and
the curcumin content in the precipitated particles were less than
80%. This can be attributed that the individual substance might pass
through the stainless filter as a particle product collector during
the SC–CO2 antisolvent experiments.33 The results also showed that the increasing amount of PVP
addition was almost followed by the increasing precipitation yield
at each condition. It is well known that the PVP solubility is much
higher in ethanol (over 10% w/w at room temperature) than in acetone
(less than 10% w/w at room temperature).34 Hence, when the amount of PVP addition in the feed solution with
acetone–ethanol (9:1 in volume ratio) as a solvent was increased,
the curcumin–PVP precipitation occurred earlier in time during
the expansion process due to increasing the degree of supersaturation
and faster nucleation, resulting in the increasing yield of precipitation.

Figure 5 and 6 exhibit the
SEM images of the collected particle
products and their diameter produced from feed solution containing
2 to 4% PVP at various operating conditions (temperatures and pressures).
In the physical transformation process, there are two potential ways
to form a particle under the SC–CO2 antisolvent.
They are the solvent removal or evaporation into the antisolvent phase
and the diffusion of antisolvent into the feed solution droplet. Therefore,
aside from the physical properties of SC–CO2 as
an antisolvent, the concentration of the starting material also has
a significant effect and has to be an important parameter in mass
transfer between solute solvents and CO2, resulting in
particle formation. Generally, the solute supersaturation occurs very
late when the lower concentration of feed solution was fed in the
SC–CO2 antisolvent to produce particles. Next, the
solute precipitation will delay, and the nucleation of solute dominates
growth, resulting in smaller precipitated particles. Contrariwise,
by enhancing the feed solution concentration, the supersaturation
of the solute may occur sooner where the solute growth dominates the
nucleation process, resulting in bigger precipitated particles. In
addition, the higher concentration of feed solution may enhance the
solution viscosity and the solution surface tension, promoting the
large droplet; consequently, the precipitated solute with the larger
size will be generated.6,14,21,35 As a result, as shown in Figures 5d and 6f, the larger diameter of the precipitated curcumin–PVP particles
was formed when the feed solution concentration at 4% was introduced
in the SC–CO2 antisolvent system. On average, the
diameter was around 164 nm. The diameter of the precipitated curcumin–PVP
particles decreased to 124 nm when the feed solution concentration
at 2% was fed in the SC–CO2 antisolvent system at
the same operating conditions. Although it is not significant, the
result indicated that the changes in the feed solution concentration
may affect the size of particle products.

particle products and their diameter
obtained from feed solution containing 2% PVP at 60 °C with different
pressures.

Figure 6 SEM images of the collected particle products
and their diameter
obtained from feed solution containing 4% PVP at 10 MPa with different
temperatures.

It was well known that, even if
there are several types of supercritical
fluids that exist and they have been applied in various industrial
applications, mostly their dissolving power depends on their density
and owing to their higher diffusivity, lower viscosity, and lower
surface tension than liquid solvents, the fast mass transfer with
supercritical fluids may occur. These physical properties including
SC–CO2 properties can be manipulated by shifting
operating pressure and/or temperature.36,37

At a
constant operating temperature, the density of SC–CO2 will increase with increasing operating pressures. In most
cases, a higher operating pressure of the SC–CO2 antisolvent system became in favor of the nucleation process to
construct and to form a lot of particle nuclei.38−40 This condition
might lead to generating particle products with a smaller size. Therefore,
the rising operating pressure of the SC–CO2 antisolvent
from 8 to 12 MPa at a constant operating temperature was hoped to
be followed by the smaller size of curcumin–PVP particle products.
As depicted in Figure 5, the size of curcumin–PVP particle products was produced
dominantly at ranges of 250–750 nm with an average diameter
of 538 nm when the SC–CO2 antisolvent process was
performed at 8 MPa with a 60 °C operating temperature. At the
same operating temperature, the size of curcumin–PVP particle
products decreased significantly to 124 and 115 nm on average when
the SC–CO2 antisolvent process was carried out at
10 and 12 MPa, respectively. The results indicated that the fast mass
transfer between feed solution solvents and CO2 promoted
the high supersaturation for the curcumin–PVP solutes and led
to the rapid curcumin–PVP solute precipitation, resulting in
smaller curcumin–PVP particle products that, at the higher
operating pressures at this system, might provide the higher fluid
density that can highly influence the mass transfer between SC–CO2 and acetone–ethanol solvents during the precipitation
process, which results in particle formation.41,42

Similar to the operating pressure, because SC–CO2 possesses high compressibility, the minor changes in the
operating
temperature may also result in large changes in the SC–CO2 density, which means that its solvent power was also changed.
The higher operating temperature leads to the mass transfer between
SC–CO2 and feed solution solvent where, at these
conditions, the high supersaturation occurs, resulting in the smaller
precipitated particle products. On the other hand, the higher operating
temperature also promotes the decreasing SC–CO2 density
and the declining SC–CO2 ability to dissolve organic
solvents. Next, the decreasing supersaturation occurs to promote the
bigger precipitated particle product formation. Hence, it could be
said that the operating temperature in SC–CO2 possesses
two different effects on particle formation.33,43 As shown in Figure 6, the SC–CO2 operating temperature of 40 °C
resulted in the curcumin–PVP particle products with size ranges
of 50–125 nm with an average particle size of 82 nm. The size
ranges and the average of these particle products increase significantly
to 100–200 nm and 164 nm, respectively, when the operating
temperature was increased to 60 °C with the same operating pressure.
This result indicated that, at this experiment, the SC–CO2 dissolving ability declines with increasing operating temperature,
resulting in the decreasing supersaturation. Next, the bigger size
of curcumin–PVP particle products was generated.

As shown
above, the curcumin particles can dissolve entirely in
distilled water after treatment by the SC–CO2 antisolvent
to modify their surface with a PVP polymer. Regardless of their particle
size, Figure 7 illustrates
the profile of precipitated curcumin particle dissolution in distilled
water without and with PVP polymer addition at 2 and 4% when the experiments
were performed at an operating temperature of 60 °C and an operating
pressure of 8 MPa. As depicted in this figure, except for the precipitated
particle from curcumin solution without PVP polymer addition, the
amount of curcumin release in distilled water increases with the increasing
dissolution time. It indicated that the presence of PVP in the curcumin
precipitated particle can improve its aqueous solubility. It may be
attributed to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
the PVP carbonyl group and the hydrogen atom in the curcumin hydroxyl
group, and it is well known that PVP possesses both a hydrophobic
and hydrophilic part due to the existence of the chain carbon atoms
in its structure and the highly polar five-membered ring lactams.
It caused this polymer to be highly water soluble, and it even may
dissolve in a small amount of water.34 Because
of this, the release of curcumin from the precipitated particles into
distilled water increased significantly with the addition of the PVP
polymer, especially a higher concentration of PVP polymer addition.44

and with PVP polymer addition.

Conclusions
The production of fine particles by using the SC–CO2 antisolvent process from a solution of curcumin with or without
a PVP polymer was demonstrated. The experiments were performed at
temperatures of 40–60 °C and pressures of 8–12
MPa with a 15 mL min–1 CO2 and 0.5 mL
min–1 feed solution flow rate. The SEM images illustrated
that most of the precipitated particle products have spherical morphologies
with a size of less than 1 μm. The FT-IR spectra indicated that
the curcumin structural properties did not change after the SC–CO2 antisolvent process, and the curcumin particles can dissolve
entirely in distilled water after SC–CO2 antisolvent
treatment to modify their surface with a PVP polymer. Next, this experiment
demonstrated that the SC–CO2 antisolvent is likely
to be fruitful for the fabrication of phytochemical compound particles
containing biodegradability as a carrier to enhance its solubility
in the distilled water.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Crystalline
curcumin and PVP ((C6H9NO)n, average molecular
weight, 29,000) were bought from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.
(Osaka, Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ethanol
(C2H6O, >99.5%) and acetone (C3H6O, >99.7%) were purchased from Merck. Carbon dioxide
(CO2) was provided by PT. Samator Gas Industri (Gresik,
Indonesia).
All chemicals were received and used without further purification.
For preparing the feed solution, the curcumin and the PVP powder were
dissolved in acetone and ethanol at concentrations of 1.0 mg mL–1 and 2.0–4.0% in weight, respectively. Next,
they were mixed at different ratios of 9:1 (volume ratio). However,
the pump did not work properly after a few minutes of pumping when
the concentration of PVP in the feed solution was higher than 4%.
Hence, the higher concentration of PVP (higher than 4%) was not fed
as feed solutions.

Supercritical CO2 Antisolvent
Figure 8 describes
the apparatus scheme
for curcumin–PVP precipitation through the SC–CO2 antisolvent. The SC–CO2 antisolvent apparatus
system consisted of the following main parts: two high-pressure pumps
(one for the feed solution and the other for CO2; PU–980
and PU–1586, Jasco, Japan), a heating chamber (Tokyo Rikakikai,
WFO–400, Tokyo, Japan), a nozzle device (SUS–316), and
a back pressure regulator (BPR; AKICO, Tokyo, Japan). The nozzle device
was constructed from a 1/16 in. tube (0.5 mm i.d.) for the feed solution,
placed inside a 1/8 in. tube (2.17 mm i.d.) for the SC–CO2 antisolvent. This nozzle was connected to a 1/8 in. tube
(2.17 mm i.d., SUS–316) as a precipitator part with a 5.0 m
length by using union Tee (SS–200–3, Swagelok). To observe
the precipitation temperature, K-type thermocouples were attached
in the nozzle part and in the coil preheater that was located in a
heating chamber with a length of 3.0 m (2.17 mm i.d., SUS–316).
The pressure gauge was also assembled between BPR and the precipitator
product collector to monitor the operating pressure during experiments.
In this work, the experiments were carried out at 40–60 °C
and 8–12 MPa with a 15 mL min–1 CO2 and 0.5 mL min–1 feed solution flow rate. At each
condition, the experiment was performed at 60 min. The curcumin–PVP
particle products were collected in the bottles after releasing the
pressure. Next, it was stored in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature
until the next analysis.

Analytical Methods
The collected curcumin–PVP
particle products were characterized by using a scanning electron
microscope (S–4300, Hitachi, Japan) after gold coating to observe
their morphologies. Their diameters were measured from the SEM images
by using an image analyzer software (ImageJ 1.42). The SC–CO2 antisolvent products were also characterized by using a Spectrum
Two Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England). This FT-IR consisted
of the standard optical system with KBr (potassium bromide) windows
and a universal attenuated total reflectance (UATR) sampling accessory
for a spectral data collection. The thermal decomposition behavior
of different samples was characterized by thermogravimetric–differential
thermal analysis (TGA–50, Shimadzu, Japan) under a nitrogen
flow rate of 50 mL min–1 with a 10 °C min–1 temperature rate from room temperature to 500 °C.
The dissolution of the collected curcumin–PVP particle products
was observed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (V–550,
JASCO, Japan). Initially, 4 mg of the sample was dissolved in 40 mL
of distilled water at a temperature of 37 °C. After 12 h, it
was filtered with a 0.2 μm disposal membrane filter. Next, the
solution sample absorbance was measured by using the UV–vis
spectrophotometer at 430 nm. The curcumin concentration (stated as
mg curcumin L–1) was determined based on the standard
calibration curve of curcumin in ethanol. The same method was used
for the curcumin content determination in the collected curcumin–PVP
particle products.
