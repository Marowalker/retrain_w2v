Small
gold nanorods have a significantly large absorption/scattering
ratio and are especially beneficial in exploiting photothermal effects,
for example in photothermal therapy and remote drug release. This
work systematically investigates the influence of growth conditions
on the size, growth yield, and stability of small gold nanorods. The
silver-assisted seed-mediated growth method was optimized to synthesize
stable small gold nanorods with a high growth yield (>85%). Further
study on the influence of silver ions on the growth facilitates the
growth of small gold nanorods with tunable longitudinal surface plasmon
resonance from 613 to 912 nm, with average dimensions of 13–25
nm in length and 5–6 nm in diameter. Moreover, the small gold
nanorods were successfully functionalized with thiol-modified hairpin
oligonucleotides (hpDNA) labeled with Cy5. Fluorescence intensity
measurements show an increase in the presence of target DNA and an
enhanced signal/background ratio when the longitudinal surface plasmon
resonance of small gold nanorods overlaps with the excitation and
emission wavelength of Cy5. This coincides with a reduced fluorescence
lifetime of Cy5 in the hairpin structure, indicating surface plasmon
resonance-enhanced energy transfer to the small gold nanorods. This
study may provide insight on the synthesis and functionalization of
small gold nanorods in biomedical sensing and therapy.

1 Introduction
Gold
nanorods have been demonstrated as promising agents for various
biomedical applications including cancer diagnosis and treatment.1−3 The choice of gold nanorods stems from their unique optical properties
arising from localized surface plasmon resonance.4,5 The
longitudinal surface plasmon mode of gold nanorods depends on the
particle aspect ratio4−6 and can thus be tuned from the visible to the near
infrared (NIR) region. This shape-dependent optoelectronic property
manifests itself in various processes such as strong surface-enhanced
Raman scattering, two-photon luminescence, surface plasmon enhanced
energy transfer, and photothermal effects.7−13 These combined with low toxicity, water solubility, and biocompatibility,
have made gold nanorods a versatile nanomaterial with demonstrated
applications in various areas including biological sensing, imaging,
drug delivery, and cancer therapy.14−20

Localized surface plasmon resonance results in enhanced optical
absorption and scattering. Gold nanorods with a longitudinal surface
plasmon mode in the NIR region that matches the biological window
are ideal agents for biomedical sensing, imaging, and photothermal
therapy in treating cancer. Functionalized gold nanorods have been
demonstrated as useful probes in energy transfer studies for understanding
molecular interactions, recognition of analytes, and binding sites
in intracellular environments.21,22 For example, the energy
transfer process from the fluorophore (donor) to gold nanorods (acceptor)
has been exploited to good effect to understand the molecular interactions
between proteins, DNA, mRNA, and fluorescence lifetime-based sensing
of bio-analytes.21−23 In addition, Wei et al. demonstrated the assembly
of fluorophore-labeled hairpin DNA (hpDNA) on the large gold nanorod
structure for detecting mRNA in a homogenous solution.24 hpDNA has been utilized in various biological
applications because of its increased sensitivity and specificity
for target recognition.24,25

Small gold nanorods
are especially beneficial for applications
exploiting the photothermal effect,26,27 as they have
a higher absorption to scattering ratio than that of larger gold nanorods,
therefore converting more energy to heat.20 In addition, small size gold nanorods have a large surface area
to volume ratio, high cellular uptake, high clearance rate from the
liver, spleen, and the kidney, and ease of subcellular accessibility.28−36 Furthermore, the efficient fluorescence quenching abilities of small
gold nanorods render them good quenchers of background signals in
fluorescence detection techniques.37 Small
gold nanorods are therefore ideal agents for photothermal therapy,
diagnostic, biosensing, and drug delivery.5

Most of the relevant works so far have used gold nanorods
synthesized
via a seed-mediated growth method developed by Murphy’s and
El-Sayed’s groups.38,39 The gold nanorods thus
synthesized are typically over 50 nm in length and 11–15 nm
in diameter.29,31,35,40 Recently, Ali et al.40 synthesized small gold nanorods (18–25 nm in length
and 4–5 nm in diameter) via a seedless growth method by adjusting
the pH and concentration of sodium borohydride (NaBH4)
and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), respectively. Jia et
al.26 synthesized small gold nanorods with
a diameter of less than 10 nm via the seed-mediated method by simultaneously
varying both the amount of seed and CTAB added to the growth solutions
to tune the diameter of the gold nanorods. However, synthesis of stable,
small gold nanorods with controlled aspect ratios to achieve surface
plasmon resonance at selected wavelengths spanning a large wavelength
region remains challenging.

Here, we have systematically investigated
the influence of growth
conditions on the size, growth yield, and stability of small gold
nanorods. Stable small gold nanorods of improved yield were achieved
by optimizing the amount of seeds added to the growth solution (shown
in Figure 1). Small
nanorods of varying aspect ratios with longitudinal surface plasmon
resonance from 613 to 912 nm were successfully synthesized by simply
varying the amount of silver nitrate in the growth solution. Specifically,
stable short small gold nanorods were synthesized with an average
length of 14.2 nm. Moreover, we report for the first time the functionalization
of small gold nanorods with thiolated Cy5-labeled single strand hpDNA
via the ligand exchange and salt aging process. This demonstrates
the possibility of assembling thiolated aptamer and other DNA structures
onto small gold nanorods. Therefore, this work should facilitate the
development of small gold nanorod-based agents for enhanced performance
in targeted analyte sensing, biomolecular labeling, photothermal therapy,
and drug delivery.

nanorods.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Influence of Seeds and CTAB on the Size of
Small Gold Nanorods
The silver-assisted seed-mediated growth
method was used to synthesize small gold nanorods due to its flexibility
and ease of control over particle size and shape. To study the influence
of seeds and CTAB on the size of gold nanorods, we adopted the reported
silver-assisted seed-mediated growth protocol26 to produce three samples coded as G9S1, G8S2, and G6S4 as described
in Section 4.2. Figure 2 shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images and extinction spectra of these samples.
It was found that the gold nanorods had an average length of less
than 17 nm and diameter below 6 nm as shown in Table 1. The distribution of sizes of small gold
nanorods for these samples are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Both the length and diameter decrease
by increasing the amount of seeds added in the growth solution. The
decrease in size as the seed amount increases is not surprising as
increased nucleation sites results in a reduced amount of gold atoms
available to each nanorod.41,42 Similarly, the aspect
ratio decreases as the amount of seeds in the growth solution increases
due to the shortening of length26,43 that leads to a shift
in the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance peaks from 776, to 744,
to 717 nm for G9S1, G8S2, and G6S4, respectively.

Wavelength, and Growth Yield of Small Gold Nanorods at Varying Seeds
to CTAB Solution Ratios
samples	LSPR (nm)	length (nm)	diameter
(nm)	yield (%)	
G9S1	776	16.3 ± 2.9	6.0 ± 1.4	69	
G8S2	744	14.9 ± 2.9	6.0 ± 1.2	51	
G6S4	717	13.1 ± 2.8	5.0 ± 1.4	12	
The growth yield of small gold nanorods
(number of nanorods/number
of total particles) reached 69% in G9S1 as shown
in Table 1. It decreases
dramatically to 12% in G6S4 as the seed to CTAB
ratio in the growth solution increases. This could be due to a reduced
amount of CTAB surfactant selectively binding to the sides of each
nanorod, resulting in a less anisotropic growth and generation of
more nanospheres. Previous reports indicated that more byproducts
of nanospheres were formed than gold nanorods as the amount of seed
solution in the final growth mixture increased.26,40,44 Moreover, G6S4 was
found not to be stable; Figure 2d shows that the UV–vis extinction spectrum changed
from the initial two surface plasmon bands (G6S4) to one peak (*G6S4) after 24 days of synthesis,
indicative of the transformation of gold nanorods to gold nanospheres.
This implies the limitation of synthesizing short smaller gold nanorods
by merely increasing the seed to growth solution ratio.

2.2 Influence of Silver Nitrate on the Growth
of Small Gold Nanorods
Silver ions play a vital role in the
formation of gold nanorods and impact on their aspect ratios and growth
yields. Silver ions form complexes with CTAB to regulate the structural
evolution of gold seeds to the rod-like shape and improve the nanorod
yield.45,46 To investigate the influence of silver ions
on the yield and morphology of small gold nanorods, we varied the
amount of AgNO3 based on the recipe for sample G9S1. Specifically, the amount of silver nitrate used in
the growth solution was varied from 150 to 20 μL in nine samples,
while other reagents were unchanged as detailed in 4.3.

Figure 3 shows typical SEM images taken from these nine samples. Average
length, diameter, and yield of nanorods derived from SEM images are
listed in Table 2.
The distribution of the sizes of the synthesized small gold nanorods
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). It can be seen that the length of the nanorods decreases
from about 25 to 14 nm as silver nitrate decreased from 150 to 20
μL. The diameter is less sensitive to the amount of silver nitrate,
varying slightly between 5 and 6.5 nm. Silver ions were found to promote
the anisotropic growth to a nanorod shape although the specific role
of silver ions in the synthesis is still not fully understood38,39,47 The three mechanisms proposed
so far include under-potential deposition to favor growth on longitudinal
facets, face-specific capping to block specific facets, and modification
of CTAB micelle formation through silver-bromide integrations.39,48 The dependence of the morphology of small gold nanorods on the amount
of silver ions observed in this work is in line with a previous study
on conventional (large) gold nanorods. Moreover, high yields of nanorod
formation (>85%) were found for all the nine samples.

Figure 3j depicts
the UV–vis extinction spectra taken from the nine samples.
A significant blue-shift in the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance
from 912 to 613 nm was observed as the amount of silver nitrate decreases
from 150 to 20 μL. A near linear relationship was found between
the wavelength of the longitudinal surface plasmon mode (688 to 850
nm) and silver nitrate amount (25 to 80 μL), as depicted in Figure 3k. At a higher silver
nitrate concentration (>100 μL), the surface plasmon resonance
remains around 900 nm. These findings are consistent with previous
reports on the growth of large gold nanorods.39,41 This could imply that the influence of silver ions on the longitudinal
surface plasmon mode of small gold nanorods is similar to conventional
gold nanorods. The average lengths of nanorods were also found to
fluctuate between 24 and 25 nm. Tong et al. recently found that the
control of silver ions on the aspect ratio of conventional gold nanorods
occurs during the symmetry breaking period and the length of the final
nanorods formed is dependent on the available gold atom concentration.45 Therefore, the unchanged length at a higher
silver nitrate concentration suggests the depletion of the available
gold atoms.

2.3 Spectroscopic Study of
Small Gold Nanorod-Based
Nanoprobes
Functionalization of gold nanoparticles is of
importance for their biological and biomedical applications. Recently,
we have reported a new RNA nanoprobe based on functionalized conventional
GNRs with single strand DNA (ssDNA) in a hairpin structure, and the
influence of the hairpin structure and packing density on the performance
of nanoprobes.24 The ssDNA hairpin contains
a sequence complementary to the target mRNA. The fluorophores are
quenched in the absence of target mRNA. In the presence of the target
mRNA, the hairpin opens as a result of RNA–DNA base-paring,
and fluorescence is recovered or even enhanced with optimal hairpin
design. Here, we employed a similar synthetic approach to functionalize
small gold nanorods with ssDNA labeled with Cy5. The fluorescence
of Cy5 in the hairpin structure is quenched via energy transfer from
Cy5 to the gold nanorod, and the energy transfer is prominent when
the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanorods is matched to the emission
of the fluorophore. To investigate the influence of surface plasmon
resonance on the performance of nanoprobes, we selected two types
of small gold nanorods with different longitudinal surface plasmon
resonances. The longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of the first
sample is away from the emission spectrum of Cy5 while the second
sample matches the emission spectrum of Cy5. The recipe for the G9S1 series was adjusted to produce samples LG18S2 and SG18S2 by scaling
up (2×) the reagents with different silver nitrate amounts of
83.73 and 15.84 μL, respectively. The longitudinal surface plasmon
resonances of LG18S2 and SG18S2 were 857 and 661 nm, as shown in Figure 4a,b; their dimensions were 20.58 ± 4.7
nm by 5.65 ± 1.1 nm and 13.13 ± 2.1 nm by 4.89 ± 1.0
nm, respectively.

Gold nanorods coated with CTAB are not suitable
for direct bio-applications
due to their cytotoxicity to biological tissues.49−51 Therefore,
the CTAB surfactant on the surface layer of the small gold nanorods
was replaced with mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) via a round-trip phase
transfer ligand exchange.24,52 Zeta potential measurements
showed the change of surface charge from 36.0 ± 1.1 mV (LG18S2) and 25.7 ± 2.7 mV (SG18S2) prior to ligand exchange, to −20.1 ± 6.7 and
−12.9 ± 0.3 mV, respectively, after ligand exchange, indicating
the replacement of CTAB by MHA. Figure 4a,b show that the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance
bands of LG18S2 and SG18S2 blue-shifted to 839 and 654 nm without significantly broadening
after the ligand exchange process, indicating a successful ligand
exchange with no evident aggregation.24

Following ligand exchange, both samples were functionalized
with
Cy5-labeled hpDNA via a salt aging process as described in Section 4.5. The hpDNA
functionalized small gold nanorods were stable with no visible sign
of aggregation as shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). The functionality of the small gold nanorod-based nanoprobes
was evaluated by hybridizing the probes with complementary DNA (cDNA)
in a molar ratio of cDNA to GNR-hpDNA 1000:1. The hybridization of
cDNA with hpDNA opens the hairpin structure, changing the separation
between the Cy5 and gold surface and switching the fluorophore from
its initial quenched dark state to an opened bright state.

The
fluorescence spectra taken from both samples before and after
hybridization are presented in Figure 4c,d. The emission wavelength of the nanoprobes was
found centered at 665 nm for both the samples that have a larger spectral
overlap with the surface plasmon resonance of SG18S2-hpDNA and that of LG18S2-hpDNA as displayed
in the Supporting Information (Figure S4).
A significant increase in the fluorescence intensity in the presence
of cDNA is apparent in both cases, demonstrating the successful assembly
of hpDNA onto small gold nanorods. A larger fluorescence increase
(1.8-fold) was observed for SG18S2-hpDNA where
the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance overlaps with the emission
of Cy5. On the other hand, a smaller fluorescence increase (1.4-fold)
was observed for LG18S2-hpDNA because the longitudinal
surface plasmon resonance is away from the excitation and emission
of Cy5.

A three-exponential fluorescence lifetime analysis revealed
one
short lifetime component τ1 arising from the detection
of scattered excitation, and two lifetime components, τ2 and τ3, from Cy5 as shown in Table 3. The fluorescence decay curves
before and after incubation with cDNA are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). The fluorescence
lifetime of the free Cy5 fluorophore has been reported to be approximately
1.8 ns.53 The sub-nanosecond lifetime,
τ2, can be attributed to Cy5 near the gold surface
in a closed hairpin structure.11,22 The longer nanosecond
lifetime component, τ3, arises from Cy5 in an opened
hairpin that is relatively unquenched away from the gold surface.
It is noted that the average lifetime of Cy5 in SG18S2-hp prior to hybridization (0.62 ns) is smaller than that
in LG18S2-hp (0.82 ns), indicating surface plasmon-enhanced
energy transfer when the longitudinal mode of SG18S2-hp matches with the emission of Cy5. The increase of the
average lifetime for both nanoprobes upon hybridization is consistent
with the steady-state measurement, confirming the hybridization of
the nanoprobe with the target DNA. This demonstrates the potential
for employing small gold nanorods for mRNA detection and imaging.
Furthermore, the synthesis and functionalization approach reported
here can be used to develop functional small gold nanorods for targeted
drug delivery and photothermal therapy.

3 Conclusions
We have
demonstrated a successful synthesis of stable small gold
nanorods of various sizes and aspect ratios with tunable longitudinal
surface plasmon resonance from 613 to 912 nm by the silver-assisted
seed-mediated growth method. It was found that a decrease in the amount
of silver nitrate in the growth solution shortens the length of small
gold nanorods. Moreover, small gold nanorods were functionalized with
a Cy5-labeled thiol-modified hpDNA. Significant changes in the fluorescence
intensities and lifetimes of nanoprobes upon hybridization with cDNA
indicate the successful functionalization of small gold nanorods and
the capability of small gold nanorod-based probes to detect a potential
target including mRNA, microRNA, and ssDNA. Fluorescence intensity
measurements show an enhanced signal/background ratio when the longitudinal
surface plasmon resonance of small gold nanorods overlaps with the
excitation and emission wavelength of Cy5, manifesting the surface
plasmon-enhanced energy transfer, and benefiting the optical tunability
of gold nanorods. The synthesis and functionalization methods reported
in this work should shine light on further developments of functionalized
small gold nanorods for applications in biomedical sensing, drug delivery,
and photothermal therapy.

4.1 Materials
All chemicals were used
as received without further purification. Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4, 49%), (CTAB, 99%), ascorbic acid (AA), sodium borohydride
(NaBH4, 99.8%), silver nitrate (AgNO3), dodecanethiol
(DDT, 98%), MHA (99.8%), acetone (99.9%), isopropanol (99.5%), toluene
(99.8%), methanol, thiolated oligonucleotide, and the complementary
oligonucleotide were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich while hydrochloric
acid (HCL) was purchased from Fluka.

4.2 Synthesis
of Small Gold Nanorods by Varying
Seeds and CTAB Concentration
Small gold nanorods were synthesized
via the silver-assisted seed-mediated growth method.26 To investigate the influence of seeds and CTAB on the growth
of small gold nanorods, the growth method was adopted by varying the
concentration of seeds in the growth solution. The seed solution was
prepared by adding HAuCl4 (0.01 M, 0.25 mL) to a solution
of CTAB (0.1 M, 9.75 mL). Thereafter, a freshly prepared ice-cold
NaBH4 solution (0.01 M, 0.6 mL) was added to the mixture
and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 2–3 min until the seed
solution turned a dark brown color. The solution was incubated at
room temperature for 2 h for gold seeds’ growth before use.

To prepare the growth solutions for three samples (G9S1, G8S2, and G6S4), various volume of 0.1 M CTAB solutions (9, 8, and 6 mL)
solutions were made. Then, HAuCl4 (0.01 M, 0.5 mL), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 0.1 mL), and HCl (1.0 M, 0.2 mL) were sequentially
added to each solution, respectively. After thorough mixing, AA (0.1
M, 0.08 mL) was added to partially reduce gold ions (Au3+ to Au+). Stirring continued until the mixture turned
colorless.41 Finally, 1, 2, and 4 mL of
the seed solution were added to each sample, respectively, and these
were then kept at room temperature overnight. The seed solution acts
as a template for growth of rod shape in addition to reducing Au+ to Au0.39 The chemicals
used for preparing G9S1, G8S2, and G6S4 are listed in Table 4.

4.3 Varying Silver Nitrate to the Growth of Small
Gold Nanorods
To adjust the aspect ratio of the gold nanorods,
we modified the optimized recipe of G9S1 by
varying the amount of AgNO3 added in the growth solution.
The growth solution was prepared by adding HAuCl4 (0.01
M, 0.5 mL) to CTAB (0.1 M, 9 mL) in nine separate samples. To each
solution, varying amount of AgNO3 (150, 135, 120, 80, 65,
50, 35, 25, and 20 μL of 0.01 M) were added, respectively, followed
by adding the same amount of HCl (1.0 M, 0.2 mL) and AA (0.1 M, 0.08
mL). After stirring for a few minutes, 1 mL of the gold seeds, produced
under same conditions as described in Section 4.2, was added to each solution and kept at
room temperature overnight. The samples thus made were labeled as
G9S1-150, G9S1-135, G9S1-120, G9S1-80, G9S1-65, G9S1-50, G9S1-35, G9S1-25, and G9S1-20. The chemicals used for preparing the growth solution
to investigate the influence of silver nitrate on the size of small
gold nanorods are shown in the Supporting Information Table S1.

4.4 Ligand Exchange of Short
Small Gold Nanorods
The CTAB surfactant on the surface of
as-synthesized gold nanorods
is not bio-friendly and prevents the direct assembly of hpDNA to the
gold surface, therefore ligand exchange was performed to replace the
CTAB surfactant via ligand exchange.24 We
performed ligand exchange for two samples (LG18S2 and SG18S2) using round-trip phase transfer
ligand exchange protocol previously reported in the literature.24,52 Specifically, the CTAB surfactant on the surface of small gold nanorods
was replaced by MHA. The pellets of ligand-exchanged small gold nanorods
were suspended in TBE (pH 8.5, 50 μL) buffer.

4.5 Functionalization of Small Gold Nanorods
Following
the ligand exchange, the gold nanorods were functionalized
with thiolated hpDNA labeled with Cy5 according to a previous protocol24 described in Figure 1. hpDNA is composed of Cy5 label located
at the 5′ end and the thiol group at the 3′ end (5′-Cy5-CTGACTTG
GTG AAG CTA ACG TTG AG CAAGTCAG-AA–(CH2)6–HS-3′). The thiolated hpDNA (105 nM, 10
μL) was activated with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride
(TCEP, 10 μL) as reported earlier.24 hpDNA was conjugated with small GNRs (5 nM) in a molar ratio of
400:1 using a previously reported salt aging procedure.24,54,55 The conjugates were washed at
4 °C and resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 10 mM, 50 μL)
after centrifuging.

4.6 Hybridization of hpDNA-GNRs
Nanoprobes with
cDNA
Excessive complimentary DNA (cDNA) was incubated with
hpDNA-GNRs nanoprobes in a ratio of 1000:1 for 2 h at 4 °C for
each sample prior to measuring the fluorescence intensity and lifetime
response of the nanoprobes.

4.7 Characterization of Gold
Nanorods and hpDNA
GNRs
SEM (FEI Quanta FEG 250) was used for the morphological
characterization of the gold nanorods using a 30 kV electron beam
and bright field/dark field scanning transmission electron detectors.
ImageJ was used for size analysis. Over 200 nanoparticles imaged at
different sample areas were analyzed to obtain the average length
and diameter. The zeta potential of the GNRs was measured using a
Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Panalytical, UK).

The gold nanorods
were centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min and resuspended in
2 mL of distilled water in a conventional plastic cuvette (1 cm path
length). The absorption spectra of gold nanorods were measured with
a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 2, PerkinElmer). A Fluorolog
spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Ltd., Middlesex, UK) was used
to measure the fluorescence spectra at an excitation of 635 nm.

Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were conducted using the
time-correlated single-photon counting technique with an IBH FluoroCube
fluorescence lifetime system (HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd., Glasgow,
UK). The samples were excited with a 638 nm pulsed light-emitting
diode (NanoLED) source operating at a repetition rate of 1 MHz. Fluorescence
decay measurement was taken at the magic angle (54.7°) to nullify
anisotropy effects. Data analysis was performed using the DAS6 package.
Fluorescence lifetimes were analyzed by fitting the decay curves to
the multi-exponential decay model given as 1  where τi are the decay times and Bi the associated amplitudes.
The fractional contribution of
each lifetime component to the steady-state intensity is represented
by 2  

The average lifetime (τ̅)
is calculated as. 3  

The decay curves were fitted to a 3-exponential model to account
for the fluorescence decay components arising from Cy5 in hybridized
and closed hpDNAs and light scattering (τ1) that
was fixed at 0.5 channel.
