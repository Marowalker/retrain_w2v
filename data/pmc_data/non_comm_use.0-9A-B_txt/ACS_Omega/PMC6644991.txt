The
pronounced enrichment of surface-active compounds in the aerosols
produced by bubble bursting plays a central role in the chemical transfer
from the ocean into the atmosphere and has an important impact on
the global Earth’s climate. However, the mechanism of chemical
enrichment in bursting bubble aerosols remains poorly understood and
controversial due to the high complexity and diversity of experimental
behaviors. Contrary to the common belief, here we show that the major
share of surfactants in the jet droplets produced by individually
bursting bubbles at a calm solution surface is released directly from
the bubble surface rather than from the solution surface or subsurface
microlayer. We reveal that surfactants are accumulated at the surface
of a rising bubble in solution following three successive stages with
strongly distinct adsorption profiles: linear kinetic, mixed kinetic,
and equilibrium. The magnitude of surfactant enrichment in the aerosol
is directly determined by which adsorption mode is in control by the
moment of the bubble bursting at solution surface. Our mechanistic
description explains the diversity of experimental observations regarding
the surfactant enrichment in aerosol droplets and lays the ground
for understanding the more complex behaviors associated with collective
effects at the solution surface (e.g., breaking waves).

Introduction
Bursting of gas bubbles at a liquid–air
interface is a common
phenomenon in many natural and industrial processes,1−6 the most common examples being the formation of sea spray aerosol7−12 and the effervescence of sparkling beverages.13−18 The mechanism of bursting bubble aerosol formation has been extensively
studied for several decades, both from the physical17−22 and chemical23−27 points of view. One of the most interesting aspects of the bubble
bursting process is the substantial enrichment of surface-active organic
matter in the bursting bubble aerosol relative to the bulk solution.26−30 Earlier studies revealed that soluble organic carbon in sea spray
aerosols is enriched by, on average, several hundred times relative
to the bulk sea water,27 and this phenomenon
has an important impact on the global Earth’s climate.10,28,29 It has been also demonstrated
that the enriched content of surface-active compounds in fizzy aerosols
is largely responsible for the characteristic organoleptic properties
of sparkling beverages.13,17 Recently, bubble bursting
has also been demonstrated as a potentially useful approach for the
analytical preconcentration of organic solutes.31,32

Unfortunately, the comprehensive investigation of bubble bursting
process and associated enrichment of surface active compounds is greatly
complicated due to the broad diversity and high transience of processes
at the water–air interface.33,34 These processes
may include bubble coalescence,35 foaming,36 nonequilibrium mixing at the air–liquid
interface,30 intermolecular interactions,30,32,37 turbulence effects,21 nucleation,38 as
well as different modes of bubble bursting, depending on both the
size of bubbles22,39,40 and the surface tension of the solution.17,41 These processes not only increase the mechanistic complexity but
also significantly affect the reproducibility of experimental behaviors.34 As a result, the chemical transfer by bubble
bursting remains poorly explored and controversial. Thus, there is
yet no agreement whether surface-active organic compounds are mainly
released into the atmosphere directly from the bubble surface,24,42,43 solution surface, or the subsurface
microlayer.33,44−46 Another poorly
studied aspect is the dynamics of surfactant accumulation via nonequilibrium
molecular adsorption on rising bubbles in solution and the establishment
of molecular equilibrium at the bubble surface. Currently, it remains
largely unknown whether the chemical enrichment in bursting bubbles
can be reliably predicted using adsorption models developed for stationary
liquid–air interfaces.47,48 Apparently, surfactant
enrichment in bursting bubble aerosols is a highly complex behavior,
and many more mechanistic studies under simplified and well-controlled
settings are required for the better understanding of underlying mechanisms.34

This study contributes new data on the
adsorption process of organic
species at the surface of rising bubbles in the water as well as on
the process of the bubble bursting. Concentrations of rhodamine dyes
in the aerosol phase are related to the bubble traveling path in solution
as well as to rhodamine concentration in solution. Three stages of
interaction between the bubbles and aqueous solution are identified:
linear kinetic adsorption, mixed kinetic adsorption, and equilibrium
adsorption. Comprehensive mechanistic interpretation of surfactant
enrichment in bursting bubble aerosol is provided.

Experimental
Section
The concentration enrichment in bursting bubble aerosol,
relative
to the bulk solution (E = Caer/Cbulk), was studied for three
individual room-temperature aqueous solutions of rhodamine dyes, rhodamine
101 (R101), rhodamine B (RB), and rhodamine 6G (R6G). These three
rhodamine dyes were selected for their environmental relevance as
common contaminants,49,50 high and well-studied surface
activity,51 as well as for the high sensitivity
of quantitative detection. This allowed the determination of E-values in a broad range of Cbulk (10–8–10–4 M). Nitrogen
bubbles in individual water solutions of RB (99.75% purity; Xilong
Chemical company, Guangzhou), R101 (99.9% purity; Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai),
and R6G (99.9% purity; Macklin Biochemical company, Shanghai) were
generated at ambient conditions by feeding neutral nitrogen gas through
an air diffuser (0.2–5 μm pore size; diameter, 23 mm;
height, 5 mm; custom manufactured in the glass facility of Nanchang
University) at the bottom of solution (diameter, 10 cm; height, 1–100
cm). Inert nitrogen gas was chosen for the simplicity of mechanistic
consideration. The large diameter of solution vessel (10 cm), relative
to the diameter of the diffuser (2.3 cm), was chosen to prevent the
collisions of rising bubbles with the walls of the vessel. To minimize
the role of interfacial processes at the solution surface associated
with bubble foaming, coalescence, and other collective effects, as
well as to reduce the bubble coalescence and turbulence, the bubbling
flow rate was brought to a minimal possible level, at which stable
bursting process could still be achieved (2 mL/min). The average diameter
of rising bubbles under those conditions was ca. 0.5 mm and was not
visibly changed with bubble path. The speed of rising bubbles was
ca. 20 cm/s and was not measurably altered during the bubble rise
in solution. The bubble path was adjusted from ca. 1 to 100 cm by
controlling the immersion depth of the diffuser in the solution. The
bursting bubble aerosol was collected using a glass slide fixed above
the liquid surface, as described in our earlier publication.32 Typically, ca. 50 μL of aerosol was collected
within 5 min at the bubbling flow rate of 2 mL/min. The molar concentration
of rhodamines in the collected aerosol was measured by UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy (2J1-0004 U-2900UV/VIS Dual beam spectrophotometer,
Hitachi, Japan). Every experiment, including the preparation of stock
solutions, aerosol collection, and UV–vis detection, was repeated
in five technical replicates. For each rhodamine solution, E-values were determined as a function of Cbulk and bubble path (h) (Figures 1–4). Every bar in the graphs corresponds to the average of at least
five independent experiments repeated using freshly prepared solutions.
The experimental results were analyzed in reference to the data on
rhodamine adsorption at the stationary plane water–air interface
and earlier studies of the bubble bursting.51

was revealed for R6G.

Results and Discussion
Bubble Bursting at the Solution Surface
It is convenient
to start the description of surfactant enrichment in bursting bubble
aerosol by considering the process of the bubble bursting. There are
two principal mechanisms whereby a bubble that has reached the solution
surface can burst: film droplet formation and jet droplet formation.52 It has been experimentally demonstrated in earlier
studies that individual gas bubbles in aqueous solutions with a diameter
<2 mm produce mostly jet droplets upon bursting, although the presence
of film drops cannot be fully eliminated.14,52 The average diameter of bubbles reaching the surface in our experiments
was ca. 0.5 mm, and, therefore, it can be concluded that the chemical
transfer was mainly contributed by jet droplets. While film droplets
are formed upon the collapse of the upper liquid film of the bubble,53 jet droplets are rather formed from the bottom
of the bubble.19,54 In the jet droplet mechanism,
the top film separating the bubble from the atmosphere drains back
to solution by gravitational forces. The produced sub-millimeter-sized
cavity is subjected to the restoring force, which tends to flatten
this cavity by capillary forces. These forces give rise to the high-speed
vertical jet shooting out above the free surface. The jet then breaks
into a train of 1–10 droplets.17,54

The
jet droplet mechanism of aerosol formation together with the pronounced
dependence of surfactant enrichment in bursting bubble aerosol on
bubble path (Figures 1 and 2) strongly indicates that the surfactant
molecules mostly make it into the aerosol droplets directly from the
surface of individually bursting bubbles rather than from the solution
surface or the subsurface microlayer (Figure 5). Hence, it is an important conclusion that
the experimentally measured surfactant concentration in the aerosol, Caer, is mainly contributed by surfactant molecules
adsorbed from the bulk solution to the surface of rising bubbles,
as illustrated in Figure 5. It should also be noted that earlier studies demonstrated
that surfactants adsorbed to the bubble surface do not notably affect
the characteristics of bubble bursting process as long as they do
not induce significant alterations in surface tension.17 Therefore, for the concentration range studied
in our experiments (10–4–10–8 M), it is reasonable to assume that Caer should be proportional to the magnitude of surfactant adsorption
at the bubble surface, Γbub, right before bursting.

Figure 2 Dependence
of surfactant enrichment in bursting bubble aerosol,
relative to bulk solution (E = Caer/Cbulk), on bubble path
(h) for RB at Cbulk =
10–7 M (a), Cbulk =
10–6 M (b), and Cbulk = 10–5 M (c). No clear linear slope was revealed
at 10–5 M.

The contribution of surface solution layer to the overall
surfactant
concentration in the jet droplet aerosol, Caer, can be roughly estimated by approximating experimental values of
surfactant enrichment to the zero-bubble path (h =
0). For example, for R101, E(h =
0) ≈ 26 and E(h = 100 cm)
≈ 350 (Figure 1a). This means that at h = 100 cm, the contribution
of surface solution layer to the overall Caer can be estimated equal to ca. 7%, and the rest, ca. 93% of R101
molecules in the aerosol, is accumulated at the surface of a bubble
over its rise in solution and is directly released upon bursting.
Similar estimation is obtained for RB (Figure 1b). For R6G, the approximation to h = 0 is less accurate because the linear slope is very
abrupt (as discussed in detail below) but similar proportionality
can be seen (Figure 1c). Our estimations for R101, RB, and R6G well agree with the earlier
reports that the carbon enrichment in the ocean surface microlayer
are generally small (<10) compared to those in ocean aerosols (>100),
suggesting that contributions from the microlayer probably account
for relatively minor fractions of the released carbon under most conditions.24,27,42 Of course, the collective bubble
effects at the surface (such as foaming in breaking waves) should
introduce additional complications to the behavior of individual bubbles,
e.g., due to the onset of film bursting mechanism.22,30,44−46 It may be expected that
the onset of film bursting mechanism should enhance the release of
surfactants adsorbed at the solution surface. The impact of collective
effects at the solution surface on the chemical concentration enrichment
by bubble bursting is the subject for further research.

Bubble Rise
in Bulk Solution
Given the proportionality
between Caer and Γbub right before bursting, we can use the magnitude of Caer and its dependence on h and Cbulk to characterize the dynamics of surfactant
adsorption on a rising bubble in solution. According to the current
mechanistic description, a gas bubble rising from the bottom of a
bulk solution adsorbs surface-active solutes and carry them toward
the solution surface.52 Our results demonstrate
that during its rise to the solution surface, a bubble passes three
successive ranges of molecular adsorption with strongly distinct characteristics:
(a) linear kinetic adsorption; (b) mixed kinetic adsorption; and (c)
equilibrium adsorption (Figure 5).

Linear Kinetic Adsorption
The linear kinetic regime
of adsorption corresponds to the earliest stage of bubble rise, when
Γbub is still too low to cause any notable activation
energy barrier of adsorption or molecular desorption back from the
interface. Due to the lack of activation energy barrier, the linear
kinetic regime of molecular adsorption to bubble can be viewed somewhat
analogous to the diffusion-controlled dynamic adsorption in classical
models of stationary interfaces.55 However,
contrary to the diffusion-controlled adsorption at the stationary
interface, the fluid surrounding the bubble is constantly renewed
due to the bubble movement. As a result, the rate of purely linear
kinetic adsorption is determined by the rate at which a rising bubble
runs upon surfactant solutes rather than by molecular diffusion. In
the linear kinetic mode, every surfactant molecule that is run upon
by a rising bubble gets adsorbed.

Here, we use a simple model
to estimate the molecular adsorption in the linear kinetic mode. Upon
its rise in solution over the path h, a bubble of
diameter dbub sweeps the volume equal
to (πdbub2/4) × h. This volume contains (πdbub2/4) × h × Cbulk moles of surfactant. On the basis of the premise
that every surfactant molecule in this volume gets adsorbed, the magnitude
of Γbub is increased by (πdbub2/4) × h × Cbulk/(πdbub2) = h × Cbulk/4. In other words, in the linear kinetic mode 1  

To translate the estimate for Γbub into the domain
of experimentally measured Caer and E, we evaluated the total amount of surfactant and solution
volume released upon single bubble bursting. For the bubble size range
relevant to our study (diameter, 0.2–1.8 mm), Kientzler et
al.,19 using the direct photographic approach, measured
the size of the produced jet droplets to be on the order of one-tenth
of the bubble size, each bubble producing about five droplets. Therefore,
upon bursting one bubble, the total volume of released droplets (∑vdrop) is equal to ∼0.13 ×
5 = 0.005 of its own volume (vbub). The
average diameter of rising bubbles (dbub) in our experiments was ca. 0.5 mm and was not visibly changed with h. Therefore, the net amount of surfactant molecules (in
moles) released into aerosol upon bursting of one bubble can be estimated
as ∑μdrop ∼ 0.005 × Caer × vbub = 0.005 × E × Cbulk × vbub. As discussed above, the major share of
surfactant molecules in the bursting bubble aerosol arrives from the
bubble surface. In other words, μbub ≈ ∑μdrop. Surfactant adsorption at the bubble surface is derived
as 2  

From eq 1 and eq 2, we can predict the dependence
of E on h in linear kinetic adsorption:
(∂E/∂h)T ≈ 300/dbub. At dbub ≈ 0.5 mm, our model predicts (∂E/∂h)T ≈ 15 cm–1. This means that in the linear
kinetic range, the magnitude of Caer should
increase by ca. 15 × Cbulk over every
centimeter of bubble rise. Furthermore, our predictions indicate that
the magnitude of the linear slope (∂E/∂h)T should be largely independent
of Cbulk and of surfactant properties.
The major parameter responsible for the magnitude of linear slope
(∂E/∂h)T is the bubble size. The smaller the bubble diameter,
the larger is the slope. This behavior was experimentally observed
in earlier studies.24,32

The predicted behaviors
are in very good qualitative and quantitative
agreement with experiments (Figures 1 and 2), which yield a strong
support for the relevance of our model. Thus, the magnitude of the
linear slope in our experiments is measured as (∂E/∂h)T ≈
15.3 cm–1 for RB and R101 at 10–7 and 10–6 M (Figures 1a,b and 2a,b). This
is the maximal possible rate of enrichment for any surfactant under
the bubbling conditions used in our study. It should be noted that
the span of the kinetic range shrinks with Cbulk due to the faster saturation of the bubble surface. For
RB, the span of the linear range was h ∼ 50
cm (which corresponds to ∼2.5 s of rise time) at Cbulk = 10–7 M (Figure 2a), h ∼ 10 cm at Cbulk = 10–6 M (Figure 2b) and could not be experimentally
identified at Cbulk = 10–5 M (Figure 2c). Also,
the span of the linear kinetic range (but not the rate of adsorption
in the linear kinetic range) strongly depends on surfactant properties.
The earlier the onset of activation energy barrier of surfactant adsorption,
the shorter is the linear kinetic range. Thus, no clear linear kinetic
regime could be distinguished for R6G at Cbulk = 10–6 M (Figure 1c), most probably because R6G displays the particularly
early onset of activation energy barrier with Cbulk.51 Our data indicate that R6G
displays notably long-ranged linear kinetic adsorption only at Cbulk < 10–9 M. Thus, at h = 100 cm and Cbulk = 10–10 M, the E-value for R6G becomes
nearly equal to the value E ≈ 1550, predicted
by the linear kinetic adsorption equation (∂E/∂h)T ≈
15.3 cm–1 (Figure 4), which indicates that the adsorption of R6G under
those conditions follows linear kinetic mode at least up to the bubble
path of 100 cm.

Due to the good agreement between experimental
data and the proposed
model, we believe that in the linear kinetic mode, surfactant diffusion
does not have a notable contribution to the rate of molecular adsorption
at the moving bubble surface. Here, we also attempted to apply a model
earlier proposed by Ybert and di Meglio56 to estimate the surfactant flux to the interface of a rising bubble.
In their calculations, the authors assumed that the adsorption occurs
through diffusion, the role of convection being in a constant renewal
of the fluid surrounding the bubble.56 However,
the obtained prediction for adsorption slope (∂E/∂h)T ≈
72 cm–1 was ca. 5 times higher than the value (∂E/∂h)T ≈ 15.3 cm–1, as measured in our experiments.
Thus, we conclude that under the experimental conditions employed
in this study, the linear kinetic adsorption is not controlled by
molecular diffusion but rather mainly by bubble movement (convection).

Mixed Kinetic Adsorption
At a certain point (still
below equilibrium), further growth of Γbub (and Caer) with h starts to deviate
from linearity and gradually slows down compared to the linear kinetic
range (Figures 1 and 2), indicating the onset of mixed kinetic adsorption.
The term “mixed kinetic adsorption” is adapted from
the classical model of dynamic molecular adsorption at stationary
interfaces.47,48 This term indicates that adsorption
is simultaneously driven both by kinetic and thermodynamic factors.
There are two principal factors responsible for the slow down in the
growth of Γbub with h in the mixed
kinetic range relative to the linear kinetic range. These two factors
are the molecular desorption from the bubble and the onset of adsorption
activation barrier imposed by the adsorbed surfactant molecules.55 Molecular desorption slows down the growth of
Γbub with h by enhancing the molecular
outflow from the bubble surface, whereas the onset of adsorption activation
barrier reduces the molecular inflow onto the bubble surface. Which
of these two factors is primarily responsible for the nonlinearity
depends upon the properties and concentration of a specific surfactant.
For example, in the case of weak molecular adsorption and extremely
low Cbulk, the concentration of adsorbed
surfactant molecules is too low to bring about activation energy barrier
of adsorption, and the nonlinearity between Γbub and h ultimately occurs entirely due to the gradual enhancement
of molecular desorption. Alternatively, in the case of very strong
adsorption, the nonlinearity between Γbub and h mainly occurs due to the onset of activation energy barrier
at the bubble surface. This scenario is commonly relevant to ionic
surfactants, such as rhodamines, for which energy tension effects
due to electrostatic repulsion at the surface start at very low concentrations.47,57 Among the three studied rhodamine surfactants, R6G displays particularly
rapid elevation in the activation energy barrier of adsorption with Cbulk,51 and this
is the most likely reason why at equal Cbulk the onset of nonlinearity between E and h occurs for R6G much earlier than for RB and for R101 (Figure 1c). Our results indicate
the pronounced activation energy barrier of adsorption for R6G, even
at Cbulk < 10–8 M
(Figures 3c and 4). The adsorption of
R6G becomes nearly linear kinetic at Cbulk ≤ 10–10 M, as indicated by the close similarity
between the experimental magnitude of E at Cbulk = 10–10 M with the magnitude E ≈ 1550 predicted by the linear kinetic adsorption
equation (∂E/∂h)T ≈ 15.3 cm–1 (Figure 4).

aerosol, relative

aqueous solutions of R6G at h = 100 cm.

Equilibrium Adsorption
In the equilibrium
range, the
magnitude of surfactant adsorption at the surface of a rising bubble,
Γbub, no longer grows with h because
the rate of molecular desorption has become equal to the rate of molecular
adsorption. The bubble path, over which the equilibrium at a rising
bubble surface is attained, largely depends upon Cbulk. The higher the Cbulk, the more intense is the molecular exchange between the bubble surface
interface and bulk solution and, hence, is the faster attainment of
equilibrium. In our experiments, the attainment of molecular equilibrium
at the bubble surface in RB solutions roughly required h ∼ 15 cm at Cbulk = 10–5 M, whereas h ∼ 30 cm at Cbulk = 10–6 M. The equilibrium was not
reached at Cbulk = 10–7 M, up to a maximal bubble path h = 100 cm (Figure 2a).

In the
ideal scenario, when the turbulence effects, bubble coalescence, and
other effects associated with bubble movement do not significantly
influence the adsorption process, the equilibrium Γbub ultimately reached at high bubble paths should be equal to the magnitude
of equilibrium adsorption at the stationary water–air interface
of aqueous solution (Γsol) for the same Cbulk (Figure 5). For surfactant concentrations well below
the critical micelle concentration, the magnitude of equilibrium surfactant
adsorption at the interface may be estimated from its surface activity,
i.e., the slope of a σ–ln(Cbulk) dependence (Figure 3c–e), based on the Gibbs adsorption equation with the ideal
dilute solution assumption.47 For the room-temperature
aqueous solutions, at Cbulk = 10–5 M, the estimated magnitude of equilibrium adsorption at the interface
increases the order Γsol(R6G) ∼ 0.05 μmol/m2 < Γsol(R101) ∼ 0.13 < Γsol(RB) ∼ 0.2 μmol/m2.51 Consistently, the magnitude of surfactant enrichment in
the bursting bubble aerosol at Cbulk =
10–5 M and h = 35 cm increases
in the same order: E(R6G) ∼ 5 < E(R101) ∼ 65 < E(RB) ∼
115 (Figure 3). It
should be noted that our data indicate that at Cbulk = 10–5 M and h = 35
cm, the adsorption of rhodamines at the bubble surface definitely
reaches equilibrium before bursting (Figure 2). Therefore, the magnitude of surfactant
enrichment in the bursting bubble aerosol, produced under the conditions
of equilibrium adsorption at the bubble surface, is largely determined
by the thermodynamic properties of a surfactant, such as its surface
activity.

Figure 5 Mechanistic representation for the multistage surfactant adsorption
at the surface of rising gas bubbles and surfactant enrichment in
the aerosols produced by individually bursting bubbles.

It should be noted that the surface activity of
a surfactant determines
the magnitudes of its Γbub and E, only in the equilibrium adsorption range. In contrast, as we have
shown above, in the linear kinetic region, the magnitudes of Γbub and E are largely independent of the surfactant
properties (Figures 1a,b and 2a,b). Thereby, we reveal that the
magnitude of surfactant enrichment in bursting bubble aerosols strongly
depends upon which mode of adsorption (kinetic, mixed kinetic, or
equilibrium) is in control by the moment of the bubble bursting for
the particular surfactant (Figure 5).

Estimation of Equilibrium Adsorption at the
Bubble Surface
We use the experimental magnitudes of surfactant
concentration
in bursting bubble aerosols, Caer, obtained
in the equilibrium adsorption range to evaluate the equilibrium Γbub right before bursting. Using eq 2 and the experimental values from Figure 3, at Cbulk = 10–5 M, we calculate Γbub(RB) ∼ 0.4 μmol/m2, Γbub(R101) ∼ 0.3 μmol/m2, and Γbub(R6G) ∼ 0.02 μmol/m2. These very
rough estimates for Γbub are surprisingly in good
agreement with the earlier estimated adsorption of rhodamines at the
stationary air–water interface, Γsol, derived
from the surface tension measurements at the same Cbulk: Γsol(RB) ∼ 0.2 μmol/m2, Γsol(R101) ∼ 0.13 μmol/m2, and Γsol(R6G) ∼ 0.05 μmol/m2.51 The close similarity between
the magnitudes of Γbub in the equilibrium region
estimated based on Caer and the magnitudes
of Γsol indicates that the adsorption process to
the bubble surface in equilibrium range is well described using the
models developed for stationary interfaces.

Surfactant Enrichment in
Bursting Bubbles vs Molecular Concentration
Our data indicate
that at Cbulk ≥
10–6 M and h ≥ 35 cm, the
magnitude of Γbub for R6G, R101, and RB reaches the
equilibrium level before bursting (Figures 1 and 2). Therefore,
the experimental values of E for bursting bubble
aerosols can be discussed in direct relation to the data on equilibrium
surface tension at the stationary water–air surface interface
(σ). Under equilibrium conditions (Cbulk ≥ 10–6 M), both σ and E decrease with Cbulk (Figure 3), but the causes are different.
The decrease of σ with Cbulk is
directly caused by the growing number of surface- active molecules
at the interface, whereas the
decrease of E with Cbulk is rather caused by the increase of activation energy barrier in
adsorption associated with the growing number of surface-active molecules
at the interface.47,57,58 In simple words, fewer and fewer new surfactant molecules attach
to the bubble surface, as the magnitude of Cbulk is increased. At a certain Cbulk, the surface becomes fully saturated, i.e., a further increase in Cbulk brings no new molecules to the surface.
As a result, σ levels off to a certain value. It should be noted
that the magnitude E = Caer/Cbulk continues to decrease with Cbulk even after surface saturation (Figure 3). For the same surfactant,
the magnitude of E can span 3 orders of magnitude
depending on Cbulk (Figures 3 and 4). Therefore,
apart from the surface activity, the surfactant concentration in bulk
solution is another important factor that determines the magnitude
of surfactant enrichment in bursting bubble aerosols in the equilibrium
adsorption region.

At very low Cbulk, the surfactant adsorption does not reach equilibrium before bubble
bursting and rather follows the linear kinetic regime. At h = 35 cm, the linear kinetic adsorption equation (∂E/∂h)T ≈ 15.3 cm–1 predicts the magnitude E ≈ 560 for all surfactants. This predicted value
is experimentally reached for RB (Figure 3b) and nearly reached for R101 (Figure 3a) at Cbulk ≤ 10–7 M, indicating that
the adsorption of these surfactants up to the moment of bubble bursting
mainly follows linear or near-linear kinetics. In contrast, the E-value of R6G is much lower than the predicted value for
linear kinetic adsorption, which suggests a substantial role of the
activation energy barrier (Figure 3c). Our data suggest that the linear kinetic range
for R6G is only reached at Cbulk ≤
10–10 M, at which point the measured E-value is roughly equal to the value predicted by the linear kinetic
adsorption equation (Figure 4).

Summary and Conclusions
Our results
allow a comprehensive quantitative description for
the enrichment behavior of surface-active compounds in the aerosols
produced by individually bursting bubbles. The process of chemical
transfer by bubble bursting is illustrated in Figure 5. A bubble rising in the solution successively
passes three distinct ranges of surfactant adsorption: linear kinetic,
mixed kinetic, and equilibrium. In linear kinetic range, the rate
of adsorption is largely independent of surfactant properties and
is mainly determined by the surfactant concentration in solution and
bubble size. The span of the linear kinetic range strongly depends
on the surfactant properties and may extend beyond the bubble paths
of several meters. In equilibrium range, the adsorption of surfactants
solutes to the bubble surface is well described using the terms of
equilibrium models for stationary interfaces, and the enrichment of
surfactant solutes depends upon their surface activity and bulk surfactant
concentration. At the solution surface, the bubble breaks up into
jet droplets. Our data indicate that surfactant molecules are mainly
transferred into the droplets upon bubble bursting directly from the
surface of the bursting bubble rather than from the solution surface
or from the immediate surface layer of bulk solution. This conclusion
is consistent with the fact that the jet droplets are mainly formed
from the bottom interfacial layers of the bubble, whereas the top
interfacial layers are rather drained back to the bulk solution (Figure 5). Our results thereby
provide a step-by-step description of the chemical transfer by the
bursting of individual bubbles at a calm solution surface. This description
consistently resolves a great deal of uncertainty regarding the variability
of experimental behaviors. Thus, it shows that variability in the
relative partitioning of surfactant solutes to the aerosol phase is
related to which mode of adsorption is at operation for each particular
surfactant under given bubbling conditions. While the experimental
conditions in the current study were chosen for the simplicity of
mechanistic consideration, further research will address the complications
to this basic description due to the collective effects at the surface,
including bubble coalescence, foaming, ripples, etc., which commonly
accompany bubble bursting in sea spray aerosols as well as in other
natural environments.
