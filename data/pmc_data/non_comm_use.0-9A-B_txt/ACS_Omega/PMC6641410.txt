Here, we report the
synthesis of dopamine (DA)-mediated Au–Ag
bimetallic nanoclusters in aqueous solution under UV activation. The
success story emerges from monometallic fluorescent nanocluster evolution
from photoactivation of gold as well as silver precursor compounds
along with DA. The intriguing fluorescence property of the nanocluster
relates to facile incorporation of Ag in Au, showing a 6-fold enhancement
of the emission profile than simply DA-mediated Au nanoclusters. Silver
effect, which is classified under the synergism, is the main reason
behind such enhancement of fluorescence. The as-synthesized nanoclusters
are robust and can be vacuum-dried and redispersed for repetitive
application. The intriguing fluorescence of bimetallic nanoclusters
is found to be quenched selectively in the presence of sulfide ion
in an aqueous medium, paving the way for nanomolar detection of sulfide
in water. The utility of the sensing platform has been verified employing
different environmental water effluents.

Introduction
Metal nanoclusters
are classified under metal nanoparticles of
less than 2 nm diameter. Because of their tiny size, the energy levels
split into a discrete state. This causes the extraordinary optical,
catalytic, electronic, and magnetic properties of metal nanoclusters.1 The metal nanoclusters are widely implemented
in the fields of sensing, catalysis, bioimaging, nanodevice, bioconjugation,
and so forth.2−7 Coinage metals, specially gold and silver nanoclusters, have become
an interesting fluorescent probe. They have sizes comparable to the
Fermi wavelength of an electron and exhibit molecular-like behavior.
They show size-dependent fluorescence. Jellium model is used to describe
the size-dependent electronic structure and relative electronic transitions
of nanoclusters.8 However, silver nanoclusters
show brighter luminescence over gold nanoclusters synthesized by the
same motif.9 Dickson et al.10,11 have synthesized fluorescent Ag nanoclusters with two to eight atoms.
Different templates such as peptides, gelatin, proteins, DNA, and
so forth are widely used for the synthesis of fluorescent Au and Ag
nanoclusters.12 The presence of both gold
and silver in the same platform results in synergistic interaction,
causing much higher fluorescence than individual gold or silver fluorescing
nanoclusters. Pradeep et al. synthesized the mercaptosuccinic acid-protected
bimetallic Ag7Au6 nanocluster through a galvanic
exchange reaction13 Zhang et al. synthesized
Au–Ag nanoclusters from the hydrothermal method and used the
bimetallic cluster selective analysis of Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions.12 Wang et al. prepared
highly fluorescent Au–Ag nanoclusters using lipoic acid to
sense Fe(III).14 In some of these cases,
the silver effect has been utilized to achieve intense fluorescence.
Shi et al.15 have demonstrated that in
gold catalysis, the “silver effect” provides more catalytic
activity than individual gold nanoparticles. However the main problem
during the synthesis is that the reactions involve multiple steps,
and quite a long time is needed for the completion of the reaction.
Hence, we report a simple and facile synthetic process for the synthesis
of fluorescent bimetallic nanoclusters.

Noble metal nanoclusters
are widely used for catalysis,16 bio as
well as chemical sensing,17,18 cell imaging,19 and several other fields
of applications. Sensing of hazardous metals or anions in the environment
is much needed to prevent pollution. Sulfide ion is widely found in
nature as industrial wastage and as a harmful water pollutant.20 Excessive exposure to sulfide causes chronic
disorders in the respiratory tract, blood, eyes, skin, and digestive
system and also causes headaches, vertigo, impaired hearing, and autonomic
dysfunction.21 There are several techniques
involving voltametric,22 chromatographic,23 potentiometric,24 electrochemical,25 fluorometric,26 and colorimetric27 methods to detect sulfide ions. Among these, fluorescence technique
is considered as the most sensitive and selective technique.

The synthesis of fluorescent nanoclusters is quite a time-consuming
process that involves multiple steps. However, in our work, we have
synthesized a bimetallic nanocluster through ultraviolet (UV) treatment
of an aqueous mixture of dopamine (DA), Au(III) salt, and Ag(I) salt
through a simple technique. The synthetic procedure has been achieved
within 1 h of time. DA has been used as a moderate reducing agent
for the stepwise reduction. The concentration of silver ions in the
reaction medium has been varied to achieve the most intense fluorescence.
The silver effect has been seen to be effective in this case. Synthesis
of gold nanoclusters has also been done using DA and Au(III) salt
under the same experimental conditions. It is found that the presence
of silver(I) in the reaction medium always produces better fluorescent
particles than that without silver(I) salt. The as-obtained fluorescent
clusters are then characterized properly. It is found that the fluorescence
of the as-synthesized gold–silver nanoclusters gets quenched
in the presence of sulfide ions in an aqueous medium. This selective
as well as sulfide ion concentration-dependent quenching of the fluorescence
of gold–silver nanoclusters paves the way for sulfide sensing.
A linear detection range of 0.17 mM to 6.7 μM has been achieved.
Hence, our prescribed method of synthesis and application of gold–silver
nanoclusters are of academic as well as of practical use.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instruments
All reagents were of AR grade.
Triple distilled water was employed throughout the experiment. Chloroauric
acid (HAuCl4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), DA, and
sodium salt of anions were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All glassware
were cleaned with freshly prepared aqua regia, subsequently rinsed
with distilled water, and dried well before use.

All ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra were recorded in an Evolution 201
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The absorbance was measured
using a glass cuvette. At room temperature (25 °C), the fluorescence
measurement was done with a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer.
Fluorescence lifetimes were measured with an Easy life V fluorometer
(Optical Building Blocks Corporation) equipped with a 380 nm LED excitation
source. A nonlinear least squares (χ2) fit was tested
to determine the fit of the decay rate to a sum of exponentials, and
a visual inspection of the residuals and the autocorrelation function
were used to determine the quality of the fit. The sample was taken
in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm for fluorescence measurement.
VG Scientific ESCALAB MK II spectrometer (UK) equipped with a Mg Kα
excitation source (1253.6 eV) and a five-channeltron detection system
was used for the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.
The samples were fridge-dried before the XPS measurement. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were done with an H-9000 NAR instrument
(Hitachi) having an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The samples were
drop-casted onto a carbon-coated copper grid, and the grid was vacuum-dried
before loading into the microscope. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) of the samples was done using a Thermo-Nicolet continuum FTIR
microscope. All experiments were repeated three times at room temperature
in an almost neutral medium.

Synthesis of DAAuAg Fluorescent Cluster
DA-mediated
AuAg fluorescent assembly was synthesized under UV irradiation of
a mixture of AgNO3, DA, and HAuCl4 solutions.
Typically, 1.2 mL of 10–2 M HAuCl4 solution,
0.4 mL of 10–2 M AgNO3 solution, and
2 mL of 2.3 × 10–3 M aqueous solution of DA
were mixed in a 20 mL beaker, and the final volume of the solution
was made 16 mL with distilled water. This mixture was kept under UV
light of wavelength 365 nm under stirring for 1 h. After 1 h, a yellow
solution with a brown precipitate was obtained. This solution was
subjected to centrifugation to separate the solution and the solid
product. The solution shows fluorescence and hence used for further
characterization. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the as-obtained
solid mass upon redispersion in the required solvents was used for
further experimentations.

Fluorescence Detection of S2– Ion in Aqueous
Medium
An aliquot of the DAAuAg cluster (0.50 mg/1 mL) was
added individually to the aqueous solution containing different concentrations
of the S2– ion. The solution was mixed homogeneously
and kept undisturbed for 6 h at room temperature. After 6 h, the solutions
were taken for spectroscopic measurement. The interfering effects
of other metal ions were investigated individually in the presence
of the fluorescent cluster solution. During the study of the interference,
other anions were added at a concentration of 7 × 10–4 M.

Water samples were obtained from the nearby locality and
centrifuged to remove any heavy particles. Then, a series of samples
was prepared by spiking standard solutions containing various concentrations
of S2– in water samples. The resulting solutions
were further mixed with fluorescent cluster solutions. After 6 h of
mixing, the spectroscopic data were collected.

Results and Discussion
Formation
and Characterization of Fluorescent Bimetallic Nanoclusters
Coinage metals in their sub-nanometer dimension become fluorescent
because of interband transition. It is found that bimetallic nanoclusters
show furthermore intense fluorescence. Again, it is reported that
bimetallic alloy particles are more fluorescent compared to the bimetallic
core–shell structure. Hence, we ventured to synthesize a bimetallic
nanocluster with intriguing fluorescence. Intriguing 6-fold enhancement
of the fluorescence property of the bimetallic nanoclusters, compared
to gold nanoclusters, is reported here. A stable fluorescent bimetallic
AuAg cluster has been prepared in an aqueous medium using HAuCl4, AgNO3, and DA under UV irradiation for 1 h. Au(III)
and Ag(I) salts are taken in a 3:1 molar ratio. During the course
of the reaction, simultaneous generation of large Au particles and
tiny Au–Ag clusters occurs. The large Au particles are deposited
as a precipitate. From X-ray diffraction (Figure S1, Supporting Information), the presence of Au(0) has been confirmed
while Ag(0) is absent in the precipitate. The precipitate does not
show any fluorescence and henceforth is not considered for further
experimentation. The pale yellow supernatant shows fluorescence at
440 nm when it is excited at 360 nm (Figure 1). The fluorescent nanoclusters are termed
as DAAuAg. This fluorescence remains undisturbed in terms of intensity
as well as peak position even after 2 months of preparation (Figure
S2, Supporting Information). This states
that the as-synthesized particles are thermodynamically stable and
kinetically inert. In the UV–vis spectra, a peak is observed
at 271 nm, but any characteristic plasmonic peak for Au or Ag is absent.
This indicates the absence of large Au or Ag nanoparticles that show
a plasmonic peak. If the particle size is in sub-nanodimension, the
characteristic plasmonic band is not observed for plasmonic metal
nanoparticles.28

Figure 1 Absorption and fluorescence
spectral profile of DAAuAg at room
temperature in an aqueous medium. λex = 360 nm.

However, the reducing agent DA
itself is fluorescent. So, the question
may arise whether the fluorescence comes from DA or from the produced
metallic nanoparticles. To ensure the origin of fluorescence, the
same reaction was done with NaOH and K2Cr2O7 instead of the Au(III)–Ag(I) salt mixture under the
same experimental conditions. The resultant product does not show
any fluorescence, rather the inherent fluorescence of DA is quenched.
Even with extended reaction time, no significantly fluorescent product
was obtained (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Both NaOH and K2Cr2O7 can oxidize
DA. Also, the control experiment was performed by treating DA under
UV irradiation for 1 h in the absence of any metal salt. The product
of photoactivation is also nonfluorescent and shows a broad peak at
∼274 nm in the UV–vis spectral profile (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Only when both Au(III)
and Ag(I) are present at a 3:1 molar ratio, the immensely fluorescent
particles are obtained. Two phenolic groups of DA after two-electron
transfer reduce both Au(III) and Ag(I) to Au(0) and Ag(0) and itself
gets oxidized into dopamine-quinone (DQ).29 Theoretically calculated oxidation potential of DA is +0.63 eV.30 The redox potential value indicates facile reduction
of Au(III) [EAu(III)/Au(0)0 = +1.50 eV] compared to Ag(I) [EAg(I)/Ag(0)0 = +0.79 eV]. One of the plausible pathways of this reaction
is DA mediated. Initially, DA reduces Au(III) to Au(0). Because of
the facile interaction between Ag and N,31 Ag(I) ions get attached to the Au(0)–DA/DQ surface and catalyzes
the Au(0) formation process. Later, it gets reduced to Ag(0) and prompts
bimetallic cluster formation. However, Sun et al.28 have suggested that in such a situation, the reduction
of Ag(I) to Ag(0) can occur, and Au(III) may partially get reduced
to Au(I). This supposition is further supported by the report of Duo
et al.33 and Mohanty et al.32 They had concluded that the added Ag(I) helps
in bridging of the Au(I)-ligand motif during the progress of the reaction,
and the preformed Au nanoclusters are incorporated into the Au(I)–Ag(I)
ligand network, resulting in the formation of fluorescent Au–Ag
bimetallic clusters. However, XPS studies (discussion regarding the
nature of this bimetallic cluster has been discussed in the trailing
part) reveal that Au and Ag are present in their zero oxidation states.
From the redox potential values, it is clear that the formation of
Ag(0) in the presence of Au(III) is not thermodynamically facile.
The formation of Ag(0) is an example of the antigalvanic reaction34 of reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) in the presence
of the Au–DQ system. Sun et al.28 have suggested that the antigalvanic reaction between Ag(I) and
Au(0) happens probably because of the electrochemical potential difference
in the fine nanocluster system.

The presence of excess ligand
may cause dissolution of Au atoms
from the preformed Au nanocluster surfaces and form Au(I)–N
complexes. These Au(0)–N or Au(I)–N complexes can tune
the thermodynamically unfavorable reduction of Ag(I). The silver-induced
strong metallophilic interaction may be the cause of initiation of
Au–Ag alloy formation.35,36 However, the true mechanism
of cluster formation is still up for debate.

The measured quantum
yield (QY) is 6.45% (standard is quinine sulfate
in 1 M H2SO4). Wu et al.37 reported that the high QY in Au nanoclusters is due to
surface ligands, which take part in a charge-transfer interaction
with core Au nanoparticles via electron-rich atoms or groups present
in the ligand. Hence, we consider that the electron rich −NH2 group interacts with the as-synthesized DAAuAg nanoclusters
and provides stability, and intense fluorescence is observed. The
“silver effect” phenomenon is another factor on which
the fluorescence and stability of a gold–silver nanocluster
depends. Silver effect is reported to show both increase38 and decrease28 in
the fluorescence of bimetallic nanoclusters compared to gold nanoclusters.
In our case, the enhancement in fluorescence is observed. Silver concentration-dependent
fluorescence of DAAuAg particles was compared with the emission of
DAAu particles. The gold nanoclusters prepared using the DA template
under UV irradiation (1 h) without silver is termed as DAAu. The synthetic
procedure remained the same with the only difference being that silver
is absent in DAAu. The particles show fluorescence at 430 nm when
excited at 360 nm. No characteristic plasmonic peak for Au particles
is found in the UV–vis spectra (Figure 2). A peak at ∼277 nm is obtained for
the quinine form of DA, DQ. This peak is found for the DA control
solution, DAAuAg solution, and DAAu solution. However for both monometallic
gold and bimetallic gold–silver particles, the characteristic
plasmonic peaks of Au and Ag are absent. However, when DA is mixed
with Au(III), a characteristic plasmonic peak of Au(0) is observed
at ∼490 nm at room temperature, although no fluorescence signal
is observed (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The Ag(I) concentration-dependent increment in the fluorescence
intensity can be understood considering the QY and lifetime values.
During the measurement of the QY value, it is found that the QY value
is higher when Ag(I) is present in the reaction medium. The QY value
of DAAu is 2.03%, whereas the QY values for the products with different
Au(III)–Ag(I) concentration ratios are 6.29, 6.45, 6.1, 5.6,
5.4, and 5.01% for [Au(III)]–[Ag(I)] = 3:0.5, 3:1, 2:1, 3:2,
6:5, and 1:1, respectively. The lifetime values also vary widely for
these products. The average lifetime values are found be 0.97, 3.12,
4.49, 4.05, 3.89, 4.01, and 3.67 ns for [Au(III)]–[Ag(I)] =
1:0, 3:0.5, 3:1, 2:1, 3:2, 6:5, and 1:1, respectively (Table S1). So, for different concentrations of
Ag(I) in the reaction mixture, the optical property as well as lifetime
values are different.

at room temperature in an aqueous medium. (B) Fluorescence spectra
of the as-synthesized particles at different molar ratios of Au(III)
and Ag(I) salts in the reaction medium. At a concentration ratio of
3:1, the bimetallic nanocluster (DAAuAg) shows maximum fluorescence,
which is 6-fold higher than the fluorescence of gold nanoclusters
(DAAu). λex = 360 nm. (C) Fluorescence emission maximum
vs precursor salt concentration ratio plot. λex =
360 nm.

The fluorescence emission peak
of DAAuAg (Au–Ag = 3:1) is
found to be slightly red-shifted compared to DAAu nanoclusters, but
the emission is 6-fold higher. This red shift indicates the alloy
formation. It is observed that even at different molar ratios of Au
and Ag, the fluorescence intensity is higher than that of DAAu nanoclusters
(Figure 2). The fluorescence
of the bimetallic nanocluster is mainly based on Au nanoclusters,
and a certain concentration of Ag intensifies the emission via the
silver effect. With excess Ag(I) concentration, the fluorescence gradually
decreases. Again, the duration of exposure is another factor. It is
seen that 1 h of exposure of the reaction mixture results in maximum
emissive particles (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Further exposure causes more aggregation, resulting in nonfluorescent
products. Fluorescence lifetime measurement of DAAuAg shows that the
decay profile can be fitted in a biexponential curve. The average
lifetime is 4.49 ns (Figure 3). TEM image shows that the particles are homogeneously distributed
with an average diameter of 2–3 nm (Figure 3). In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image,
no distinct lattice mismatch is observed (Figure 3, inset)12 This
indicates that there may be alloy formation. FTIR spectra show the
peak for −C=O, which indicates that the reduction goes
through the formation of a quinine derivative (Figure S4, Supporting Information). From XPS studies, it
is found that Ag and Au are present in their zero oxidation states.
The peaks at 368.81 and 374.4 eV stand for Ag(0) 3d5/2 and
Ag(0) 3d3/2, respectively. Peaks for Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 are found at 83.8 and 87.01 eV, respectively
(Figure 4). This indicates
the partial presence of Au(I) in the nanoclusters. The as-synthesized
nanoclusters are so robust that they can be vacuum-dried and redispersed
for repetitive use.

Sensing of the Sulfide
Ion in Aqueous Medium
The stability
of the as-synthesized nanoclusters was tested in the presence of different
anions. It is observed that the intense fluorescence of DAAuAg is
quenched significantly in the presence of sulfide ions selectively
(Figure 5). Sulfide
ion has an inherent affinity toward Au. In the presence of the sulfide
ion, there occurs aggregation of the particles. From the TEM image,
this aggregation is obvious (Figure 5). This hampers the emission from the DAAuAg particles.
Sulfide ion continues to show quenching in the presence of other anions
also. Even thiosulfate ion does not interfere in the sulfide ion-induced
quenched emission (Figure 6). The relative fluorescence quenching for 0.67 mM and 6.7
nM is 43.3 and 92.45%, respectively. The XPS studies reveal that there
is a slight deviation in the peak positions of Au and Ag because of
interaction with sulfide (Figure S5, Supporting Information). On increasing the sulfide concentration from
0 to 0.67 mM, a straight regression line is obtained for a range of
0.17 mM −6.7 μM (Figure 7). Interestingly, no interference is observed from
other anions. This may be due to the fact that the sulfide ion is
much smaller in size, so it easily interacts with tiny nanoclusters
causing effective quenching. The comparative account for the detection
limit of sulfide ion in an aqueous medium through different sensing
techniques has been recorded in Table S2. It is interesting to note that in spite of facile interaction of
Cl– with Ag(I), there occurs no interference in
the presence of Cl– in the solution. Probably, the
difference between the Ksp values of AgCl
and Ag2S is the reason.39

Real Sample Analysis
The as-synthesized probe is further
tested on real water samples. Water samples were collected from different
sources. Initial test for the presence of sulfide was done. It was
found that drain water contained a trace of sulfide. Water samples
were spiked with the sulfide salt through the standard addition method.
Then, the fluorescence was measured. This technique was repeated three
times. The obtained relative standard deviation values allow us to
conclude that the nanoclusters can be successfully used for real sample
analysis (Table 1).

Previously, there were
few reports of the evolution of the tiny
gold nanoparticle with the bioactive molecule DA, with and without
photoactivation.40,41 Stabilization of the gold nanoparticle
in solution was also studied. Our work further confirms the previous
report of DA-induced Au nanoparticle synthesis, and the fluorescence
property of the synthesized nanoparticles was rediscovered, followed
by the synthesis of bimetallic nanoclusters under photoactivation.
The as-synthesized robust fluorescent nanoclusters have been employed
for selective and sensitive sulfide ion detection in aqueous solution. Figure 8 schematically shows
the whole procedure.

of DAAuAg.

Conclusions
In
a nutshell, we have synthesized intriguingly fluorescent AuAg
bimetallic nanoclusters with the help of “silver effect”
in a one-pot synthetic method. Proper molar ratio of gold and silver
brings intense fluorescence in the as-synthesized nanoclusters. The
bimetallic alloying has been achieved using a simple ligand DA. Also,
use of the as-synthesized clusters for probing different anions in
an aqueous medium shows that sulfide ion exclusively quenches the
fluorescence without the interference of other anions. The use of
the as-synthesized nanoclusters has been further used for real samples.
