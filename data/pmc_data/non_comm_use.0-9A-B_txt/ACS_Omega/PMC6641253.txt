This study convincingly
demonstrates a unique example of the self-assembly
of a naphthalene diimide (NDI)-appended peptide into a fluorescent
J-aggregate in aqueous media. Moreover, this aggregated species shows
a remarkable yellow fluorescence in solid state, an unusual phenomenon
for NDI-based compounds. The aggregated species has been characterized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, time-correlated single proton counting
(TCSPC), UV–vis, and photoluminescence studies. TEM images
reveal cross-linked nanofibrillar morphology of this aggregated species
in water (pH 7.4). TCSPC study clearly indicates that the aggregated
species in water has a higher average lifetime compared to that of
the non-aggregated species. Interestingly, this NDI-based peptide
shows H+ ion concentration-dependent change in the emission
property in water. The fluorescence output is erased completely in
the presence of an alkali, and it reappears in the presence of an
acid, indicating its erasing and rewritable property. This indicates
its probable use in authentication tools for security purposes as
a rewritable fluorescence color code. This NDI-appended peptide-based
molecule can be used for encryption of information due to erasing
and rewritable property of the molecule in the aggregated state in
aqueous medium.

Introduction
Supramolecular soft
materials1−6 consisting of organic π-conjugated molecules7−13 are attracting enormous interest due to their successful applications
in organic electronics. The interesting photophysical properties,
high π-acidity, and redox behavior of naphthalene diimide (NDI)
make it an excellent candidate for various applications.14−19 Moreover, this moiety offers better solubility, and it is relatively
easier to synthesize compared to its higher analogues such as perylene,
terrylene, and quaterrylenes. The incorporation of a peptide unit
into the NDI system affords the expansion of the library of NDI-based
molecules with structural diversity and functional variability in
response to the external stimuli.20−25 Although NDIs are good candidates for supramolecular chemistry,
the very weak fluorescent behavior of NDIs makes them unsuitable for
fluorescent applications in optoelectronics.26 However, a few attempts have been made to obtain fluorescent NDI
nanoaggregates in solution state by developing aggregation-induced
emission enhancement (AIEE)27−31 effect through the incorporation of peptide or other moieties in
the imide position and by attaching bulky substituent(s) in the aromatic
core of the NDI moiety.32 NDI-based molecules
generally show nonfluorescent behavior in water due to the aggregation-caused
quenching phenomenon.33 The high polarity
nature of water molecules generally facilitates the charge separation
(intramolecular charge transfer) in the chromophoric moieties, lowers
the energy of the first singlet excited state, and thereby alleviates
the transition of the molecule into a triplet state with the corresponding
fluorescence quenching.34 Generally, water
molecules can serve as good electron acceptors, which could facilitate
aggregation-caused quenching phenomenon. Although there are some examples
of aggregation of rylene dyes in water, the aggregation of NDI-based
molecular systems is not significantly emissive in aqueous medium.35−39 Moreover, they have a high tendency to form nonfluorescent species
in solid state as well.33 Thus, obtaining
a solid-state fluorescence derived from rylene dyes still remains
a real challenge.40−43 A few attempts have been made to explore the assembly of NDI/peptide-conjugated
soft materials in aqueous medium.44−47 In our previous study on the
self-assembly of NDI-based peptide P1 (Figure 1a), it has been shown that
the peptide upon self-association forms a fluorescent gel in organic
medium, exhibiting aggregation-induced emission phenomenon.48 The next challenge associated with NDI derivative
is whether it can be made soluble to water medium. If at all it is
soluble in water medium, will it be fluorescent? Therefore, it is
interesting to make NDI-based water-soluble soft materials that exhibit
significant fluorescence in water as well as in solid state for optoelectronic
device fabrication. There are only a few examples of rylene-based
peptide molecules showing pH-dependent fluorescence in aqueous medium.49−55 Thus, there is a genuine need to make NDI-appended peptide-based
molecules that not only will exhibit fluorescence in aqueous medium,
but also can change fluorescence behavior significantly depending
on the H+ ion concentration of the medium.

Over the past few years, a wide variety of anticounterfeiting
and
security technologies has been developed against counterfeiting. These
methods include water markers, holograms, fluorescent materials, and
others.56 Erasing and rewritable properties
are unique properties of smart materials that can be used as authentication
tools and devices for security purpose. There are some examples of
rewritable materials based on inorganic materials, carbon dots, organic
materials, hybrid materials, and others.57−61 However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the
above-mentioned examples of rewritable invisible ink include the NDI-based
luminescent soft material in aqueous medium, and the water-based operations
are more desirable from an eco-friendly perspective. Due to low processing
cost, good photostability and stimuli responsiveness, and easily modifiable
characteristics, self-assembling organic materials like rylene dyes
can be good candidates for this purpose. Thus, it is interesting to
make an NDI-based fluorescent soft aggregate in aqueous medium that
can be used as an invisible security ink as well as for write–erase–rewrite
purposes. An NDI-based amphiphilic peptide molecule P2 has been made, and it has been shown to form a soluble aggregate
in buffer and also in solid state, exhibiting a bright yellow fluorescence
(Figure 1). Interestingly,
in the acidic medium, this NDI-appended peptide fluorescence is enhanced,
and in the alkaline medium, the fluorescence vanishes (Figure 1b), suggesting its probable
use in rewritable florescent color code for authentication purposes
in future.

Results and Discussion
Aggregation of the Peptide Molecule
In supramolecular
π-conjugated system, control over the molecular orientation
is important to form significant functions. For this purpose, a peptide-appended
NDI-based molecule, P2, has been designed and synthesized
(Figure 1a). The molecule, P2, has a centrally located NDI core and intervening amide
(−CONH) groups for hydrogen bonding interactions as well as
carboxylic acid (−COOH) group at both ends to meet the bolaamphiphilic
character. The carboxylic acid (−COOH) groups at both termini
of the molecule can interact with water molecules, which can promote
the solubility of the molecule in aqueous medium.

The NDI-based
molecule, P2, was completely soluble in phosphate buffer
solution with a pH range of 7.25–9.0. On heating the compound, P2, in buffer solution above 80°C for 10–15 min,
it was readily dissolved. Upon cooling to room temperature slowly,
a highly viscous transparent solution appeared with a brown color.
Similarly, the compound was highly soluble in 10 mM NaOH solution.
However, the solution gives a light pink precipitation when acidified
by dropwise addition of 10 mM HCl. This study indicates that the compound, P2, is completely soluble in aqueous medium within a certain
pH range (7.5–9.0) to form a soluble aggregate. This type of
aggregate is well-characterized by using various spectroscopic techniques
in the subsequent sections of this manuscript.

Spectroscopic Studies
UV–vis spectroscopic studies
were carried out to probe the aggregation behavior of the compound, P2, from monomeric state to the aggregated state keeping the
concentrations fixed at 0.05 mM. The compound, P2, forms
a viscous solution in aqueous medium, and it forms a clear solution
in organic solvent (tetrahydrofuran (THF)). This prompted us to examine
a solvent-dependent change of the absorption spectra in only THF,
only buffer (pH 7.4), and also in the mixed solvent system (containing
THF and buffer solution) in various ratios. In THF, absorption peaks
appeared at 359 and 379 nm with a shoulder at 340 nm corresponding
to the characteristic NDI moiety in the monomeric state.44 In the solvent mixture of composition THF/buffer
(75:25), there is no significant change in the absorption peak. At
the composition THF/buffer (50:50), there is only a slight change
in the absorption peak. However, when the solvent composition is changed
to 25:75, there is a significant change in the absorption spectra
with respect to the other compositions of the solvent system. There
is a considerable decrease in the intensity accompanied by a red shift
of the major absorption peak in fully aqueous medium compared to that
of in pure organic medium (THF). The absorption peak in THF (379 nm)
is 10 nm red shifted to 389 nm in buffer solution (Figure 2a). Intensities of all absorption
peaks are significantly decreased (hypochromic shift), and a red shift
(bathochromic shift) of the lowest energy absorption band (379 nm)
is observed for the aggregates (Figure 2a) in aqueous medium. The absorption intensity of the
major peak of the compound, P2, in phosphate buffer solution
(pH 7.4) is decreased by 89% with a 10 nm red shift compared to that
of in pure THF solvent. The decrease in intensity with a red shift
of the absorption band indicates the involvement of a slipped J-type
aggregation.44 Moreover, plotting of absorption
in a fixed wavelength (379 nm) against % of buffer added reveals that
after reaching the composition 1:1 (THF/water) mixture, the aggregate
starts to form considerably, as is evident from Figure 2b. There is also an increment in the intensity
of the absorption peak for the self-association of this molecule with
an increase in concentration of compound P2 in phosphate
buffer solution of pH 7.4 (Figure S4a).

the monomeric state in THF to the aggregated state (buffer solution,

buffer in percentage (monitored at 379 nm). (c) Emission spectra of
compound P2 (2 mM) from the monomeric state (THF) to
the aggregated state (aqueous medium) and also in mixed solvent system

Intensity versus % buffer (pH 7.4) shows that a change in the fluorescence
occurs after 50% water in mixed solvent. The red dots and black dots
indicate the fluorescence measured at 410 and 540 nm, respectively.

Generally, the fluorescence of
a fluorophore is quenched upon aggregation
in water, as water is known to be a good quencher.33 However, in this study, compound P2 shows
an unexpected enhancement in fluorescence upon aggregation in aqueous
medium. In THF, NDI-based peptide P2 exhibits a very
feeble fluorescence with a broad nonsignificant peak centered at around
379 nm. A change in the solvent system from THF to aqueous medium
not only triggers the self-association from monomeric state to aggregated
state of compound P2, but also exhibits a strong and
intense yellow fluorescence with a peak at 389 nm. It should be noted
that the concentration of compound P2 is identical in
THF as well as in buffer solution. As the percentage of aqueous solution
increases by keeping the concentration of P2 fixed at
2 mM, the monomeric peak is diminished and a new broad peak with an
enhanced intensity appears at around 540 nm. It is observed from Figure 2c that after 1:1
composition of THF and buffer solution, the fluorescence increases
drastically and at 100% phosphate buffer the emission appears around
540 nm. Plotting of the intensity of emission with respect to the
percentage of aqueous solution, it was observed that the peak at 410
nm was diminished and the peak around 540 nm was increased consistently
with the addition of buffer solution (Figure 2d). At 1:1 ratio of THF and the buffer solution,
an intersection was observed between the intensity of these two peaks
(410 and 540 nm, respectively). This study also proves that the AIEE
phenomenon is involved in this case. The concentration-dependent fluorescence
experiments were performed for compound P2 in phosphate
buffer solution at pH 7.4 (Figure S4b),
and a steady increase in emission peak was observed (at 540 nm) with
an increase in concentration of compound P2.

The
fluorescence quantum yield of compound P2 was
measured using a standard dye (quinine sulfate) as a reference dye.
By comparing the integrated area of the corrected emission spectrum
with the reference of quinine sulfate,62 the quantum yield of compound P2 was found to be 4.98%
(Table 1) upon being
excited at 340 nm.

Usually, rylene-based derivatives exhibit low fluorescence intensity
in solid state. Although there are many reports of other rylene moieties
showing solid-state fluorescence, NDI-based compounds that exhibit
solid-state fluorescence are rarely found.40−43 Interestingly, after evaporating
the solvent completely, compound P2 exhibits an intense
yellow fluorescence in the solid state (Figure 3). The photoluminescence study was performed
in the solid state (by taking a freeze-dried sample) obtained from
phosphate buffer solution using the front face technique. The fluorescence
spectrum of compound P2 in solid state shows a similar
behavior as shown in solution state (Figure 3a). However, the emission peak shifts to
572 nm in solid state compared to that in phosphate buffer solution
of pH 7.4. An illustration for the solid-state fluorescence of molecule P2 has been presented in Figure 3b. Figure 3b shows that a word has been written on a glass slide
that is invisible to the naked eye. However, when the system is allowed
to undergo drying process, the aggregated solidified writing marks
glow upon UV irradiation and become visible clearly.

and evaporation. (b) Upper panel shows the writing marks written on
a glass slide with the buffer solution of P2 in daylight,
and lower panel shows the readable word (IACS) after drying (in solid
state) the writing marks under UV lamp (365 nm).

H+ Ion Concentration-Dependent Spectroscopic Studies
The optical response of the NDI-appended peptide, P2, was examined both in acidic and in basic media to investigate whether
the response is the same or different in these two media. Interestingly,
in acidic medium containing 10 mM HCl solution, compound P2 (2 mM) shows a strong yellow fluorescence (at 550 nm), whereas this
fluorescence property almost disappears in basic medium. It is evident
from Figure 4 that
in acidic medium, the aggregated peptide, P2, shows a
strong yellow fluorescence. However, in basic medium (10 mM NaOH),
no significant fluorescence peak is observed. This system can be switched
on or off in a totally reversible manner by making the environment
acidic and alkaline, respectively (Figure S5). A pH-dependent fluorescence study has been accomplished within
the pH range 7.4–9.0 in phosphate buffer solution, and Figure S6 shows a gradual decrease in fluorescence
intensity without any significant change in peak shift with a gradual
increase in pH of the solution keeping the concentration of the peptide, P2, identical (2 mM) in all cases. The compound is soluble
in phosphate buffer, and hence the pH range from 7.4 to 9.0 has been
chosen for the experimental purpose. A UV–vis spectroscopic
study (Figure S7) was performed by varying
the H+ ion concentration (by adding HCl or NaOH) on the
phosphate buffer solution of compound P2 (0.05 mM concentration).
There is a slight change or decrease in the absorbance peak upon a
decrease in pH (due to the addition of acid solution) of the medium,
and this can be attributed to the fact that the extent of J aggregation
may be stronger in the acidic medium compared to that under the other
conditions (basic or neutral pH).63

Figure 4 Emission spectra
of compound P2 in phosphate buffer
solution (pH 7.4) and under their acidic and basic conditions by adding
HCl and NaOH, respectively.

The molecule exhibits a bright yellow emission in aqueous
medium
as well as in solid state upon the irradiation of UV lamp at 365 nm.
The preservation of luminescence in the aggregated state of the molecule
may be utilized for writing words that are invisible to the naked
eye but glow upon UV irradiation. Thus, this soft material can act
as an invisible fluorescence ink. In addition, the system can be switched
on or off in a totally reversible manner by making the environment
acidic and alkaline, respectively. Such H+ ion-dependent
fluorescence switching makes it possible to use the system for an
overall write–erase–rewrite process of information.

A systematic investigation was also carried out to understand the
absorption properties of peptide P2 in three different
media (pH 7.4, acidic, and basic) keeping the concentration same (0.05
mM). Figure S7 shows that in basic medium,
the intensity of the major peak is more intense than that in acidic
medium and in pH 7.4. However, no significant peak shift was observed.
In pH 7.4 and acidic medium, the peak position and the intensities
are almost same. This indicates that the aggregation pattern (J aggregation)
is almost similar in three different media (pH 7.4, acidic, and basic).

TCSPC Study
Time-correlated single-photon-counting
(TCSPC) experiments were performed (Figure 5) for lifetime measurement of this soft material.
For peptide P2 in THF, molecules were excited at 340
nm and emission was observed at 410 nm. A triexponential short-lived
decay was noticed with an average lifetime of 477 ps, arising for
the monomeric species. Similar experiments were performed in buffer
solution at pH 7.4 with excitation at 340 nm, and the emission was
monitored at 540 nm. Triexponential decay was observed with a significantly
longer average lifetime of 1.316 ns. In aqueous medium (pH 7.4), NDI-based
peptide molecules formed an aggregated species and it exhibited aggregation-induced
fluorescence. This may be the reason for the relatively longer lifetime
of P2 in aqueous medium than that in nonaqueous environment.47 The detailed TCSPC data has been tabularized
in Table 1.

profiles of peptide P2 in THF (monitored
= 410 nm) and aqueous solution (pH 7.4) (monitored = 540 nm) at 0.2
mM concentration.

Morphological and Structural
Studies
High-resolution
transmission electron microscopic study (HR-TEM) was performed to
examine the morphological feature of the soluble aggregate of the
NDI containing peptide P2 in aqueous medium (Figure 6a). It shows the
presence of an intertwined nanofibrillar network structure for the
supramolecular aggregate in buffer solution (pH 7.4). These fibers
are several micrometers in length, and their widths are in the range
of 50–70 nm. There are some thin fibrils, which are combined
to form relatively thick fibrils in their assembled states.

Figure 6 (a) Typical
illustration of self-assembly of peptide P2 in J-aggregate
fashion toward the formation of a nanofibrillar network
structure, as evident from the HR-TEM image obtained from the solution
of P2 at pH 7.4. (b) FT-IR study of compound P2 in THF and phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). Temperature and concentration
maintained at 25 °C and 2 mM, respectively.

FT-IR study was performed to examine the role of hydrogen
bonding
in aggregate formation (Figure 6b) in buffer solution. A peak appeared at 3427 cm–1 corresponding to monomeric nonhydrogen-bonded N–H stretching
of P2 in THF. However, the sample (freeze-dried) obtained
from phosphate buffer solution showed a peak at 3304 cm–1 corresponding to hydrogen-bonded N–H stretching. In the monomeric
form, the amide C=O stretching frequency was observed at 1641 cm–1, whereas in the aggregated state in buffer at pH
7.4, this C=O stretching frequency was observed at 1644 cm–1, indicating the presence of a H-bonded sheet-like structure.

The UV–vis study, as discussed in the previous section of
this manuscript, clearly indicates the involvement of π–π
interactions among NDI-based peptide molecules to form a J-aggregated
species. Furthermore, the wide-angle XRD study (Figure S8) convincingly demonstrates the presence of π–π
stacking between the NDI core in the aggregation formation. This is
because the peak that appeared at 2θ = 27.46° corresponds
to the d-spacing value of 3.22 Å. Moreover,
the FT-IR study suggests the involvement of hydrogen bonding to form
the aggregated species. On the basis of these three above-mentioned
studies and the involvement of various noncovalent interactions, a
schematic model has been developed and is shown in Figure 6a.

Fluorescence Color Code
External stimuli, including
pressure, heat, light, interaction with guest molecules, and pH, can
cause a change in the emission properties of fluorescent organic solids.64−66 In recent years, fluorescent dyes have been incorporated into valuable
documents and used as anticounterfeiting labels widely. In this study,
NDI-appended peptide not only exhibits aggregation-induced enhanced
emission, but also shows fluorescent on/off depending on the medium
that is chosen (pH 7.4/acidic/basic). Interestingly, it also shows
intense solid-state fluorescence, and this is useful for several applications,
including optoelectronic devices, organic field-effect transistors,
field-effect transistors, and so on. Owing to the remarkable H+ ion concentration-dependent luminescence property, the capability
of peptide P2 for potential use as an invisible fluorescent
ink was tested. For this purpose, the word “NDI” was
written on a glass slide with the aqueous solution of P2, and the photographs are presented in Figure 7 under the exposure of normal light and UV
light (365 nm). Figure 7a,b clearly illustrates that the writing marks are clearly visible
(with an intense yellow color) under the UV lamp excited at 365 nm,
whereas this image is not visible under normal daylight. Interestingly,
this aggregated species exhibits significant fluorescence both at
pH 7.4 and under acidic condition, implying its probable use as a
fluorescence ink over a wide range of H+ concentrations.
A practical application based on the acid-induced luminescence of P2 is used for the write–erase–rewrite process. Figure 7c clearly shows that
the fluorescence disappears in the presence of alkali (10 mM NaOH
solution), and this property has been nicely utilized for erasing
the writings. Moreover, this fluorescence property is regained in
the presence of an acid (10 mM HCl solution), as is evident from Figure 7d. Thus, this fluorescent
NDI-containing peptide-based soft material has been used for writing–erasing–rewriting
purposes depending on chemical stimuli. It is evident from Figure 7e that the side marked
as “A”-side of a cotton stick glows with a bright yellow
color after dipping and soaking it in an acid-mixed aqueous solution
of P2, under the exposure of the UV lamp (365 nm). However,
the side marked as “B”-side of the same cotton stick,
which is dipped in an alkaline solution of P2, does not
show any significant emission. Although there are examples of several
molecular scaffolds that exhibit write–erase–rewrite
application,57−61 NDI-appended peptide-based soft material showing this type of interesting
property has not yet been reported before to the best of our knowledge.
On the basis of the remarkable fluorescence properties, compound P2 may provide an opportunity for various purposes, such as
information encryption and storage. This type of write–erase–rewrite
phenomenon is potentially useful as an authentication tool for security
purposes. There are several examples of self-assembled, water process-able
organic materials showing the write–erase–rewrite application.59,60,67 However, this self-assembled
NDI-appended peptide-based soft material is different from other above-stated
examples. This is because none of these above-mentioned reported organic
materials exhibit pH-dependent fluorescent on/off property, which
ultimately leads to a write–erase–rewrite application.
In this way, our NDI-appended peptide-based soft material in water
(without any cosolvent) stands for a unique and fascinating example
of self-assembled water process-able organic soft organic material
showing a potential write–erase–rewrite property.

slide in daylight (upper panel) and in UV light (lower panel) with
the aqueous solution of P2. (e) A-side and B-side of
a cotton stick soaked in the acid-mixed and base-mixed buffer solution
of P2 show bright and weak emission, respectively (under
UV lamp at 365 nm).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a water-soluble fluorescent peptide-based NDI derivative
has been discovered that has shown bright yellow emission in the aggregated
state in water medium as well as in solid state. UV–vis and
fluorescence spectroscopic data clearly suggest the presence of a
J-type aggregate in the self-assembled state in buffer solution. This
new aggregated species based on NDI-appended peptide also acts as
any invisible ink under normal light illumination, but it does strongly
fluoresce (yellow) under UV light, and this fluorescent soft material
is reusable for several times without any significant loss of fluorescence.
Moreover, this NDI-containing peptide-based soft fluorescence material
is endowed with wonderful erasing and rewriting property, indicating
its probable application for security purposes against forgery as
a rewritable fluorescence color code.
