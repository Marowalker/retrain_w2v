Many
anomalous properties of water can be explained on the basis
of the coexistence of more than one density states: high-density water
(HDW) and low-density water (LDW). We investigated these two phases
of water molecules through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations
using density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with various
van der Waals-corrected exchange and correlation functionals. Different
density regions were found to exist due to the difference in short-range
and long-range forces present in DFT potentials. These density regions
were identified and analyzed on the basis of the distribution of molecules
and voids present. We defined a local structure index to distinguish
and find the probability of occurrence of these different states.
HDW and LDW arise due to the presence of “interstitial water”
molecules in between the first and second coordination shells. The
population of interstitial water molecules is found to affect the
overall dynamics of the system as they change the hydrogen bond pattern.

Introduction
Molecular dynamics simulation studies
have obtained great attention
in predicting and understanding the properties of molecules through
various analytical and computational methods.1 In earlier days, classical molecular dynamics (CLMD) simulations,
dependent on the development of suitable force fields, were used to
interpret accurate results as compared to data obtained from experiments.
In the last few years, first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD)
simulations have been explored as a tool for assessing structural
and dynamical properties of the systems. The results are encouraging
and have been shown to provide new opportunities though they are still
limited to relatively short time scales due to the requirement of
enormous computational time as compared to that in classical molecular
dynamics. Kohn–Sham (KS) formalism2,3 of
density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as the preferred electronic
structure method of choice for water to biomolecules because of its
favorable performance-to-cost ratio, but the performance of DFT with
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange/correlation functionals
on liquid water is not satisfactory. GGA functionals make liquid state
of water overstructured and less dense, and water diffuses too slowly
compared to that in experimental results.4 Many approximate exchange/correlation functionals have failed to
describe the fine balance between relatively strong directional H-bonding
and nondirectional van der Waals (vdW) interactions of liquid water.
The poor description of the dispersion forces in the GGA functionals
is believed to be one of the reasons behind the origin of such differences.
Most of the approaches currently followed to add the dispersion corrections
to existing DFT functionals include various empirical components:
van der Waals density functional,5 DFT-D
methods,6−8 and dispersion correcting atom-centered one-electron
potentials (DCACP).9 Among these methods,
the last two have been able to predict the density of water molecules
satisfactorily. The structure of the hydrogen bond network in water
is found to be affected by the type of van der Waals (vdW) correction
and GGA exchange/correlation terms used, as the hydrogen bonds are
formed due to the delicate balance between covalent and electrostatic
effects.1,2 The difference in the change of strength
of the hydrogen bonding interaction leads to different local tetrahedral
arrangements of the molecules giving rise to differences in the density,
structure, and distribution of voids of the system, which further
result in the difference in dynamic properties. In fact, water can
be considered a “mixture” of two or more binding states,10−12 namely, high-density and low-density water (LDW) molecules. High-density
water (HDW) and LDW are so named because they give rise to different
density regions in the liquid state and consequently have different
hydrogen bond patterns.13−16 The different types of water molecules arise due
to the presence of interstitial molecules in extended network of the
local tetrahedral arrangement. The formation of interstitials is due
to both distortion and collapse of first and second solvation shells,
respectively.17 Two states of water molecules
are very common and found to exist in the supercooled region of water18−21 and also when ambient and supercooled water undergo transition under
compression. Many anomalous properties of water, such as exhibition
of maximum density at 4 °C, presence of a second critical point
at low-temperature water, and stability-limit conjecture,22−26 which make it so unique liquid, can be explained on the basis of
the coexistence of these two phases.27,28 Experimentally,
the signatures of these different phases of water have been observed
in the neutron scattering experiments,12,28 terahertz
spectroscopy,27 and ultrafast spectroscopy.11,29 The involvement of the different van der Waal’s potentials
can lead to different populations of these two states.10,30,31 Therefore, it would be interesting
to observe the effect of these different model potentials having different
van der Waals and GGA exchange/correlation terms on the structure
and density, distribution of interstitial molecules, and distribution
of void space of liquid water.

In this respect, we performed
FPMD simulations having different
van der Waals and GGA exchange/correlation terms to probe the liquid
phases of water. We considered Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr
(BLYP), BLYP-D2, BLYP-D3, BLYP-DCACP, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE), PBE-D2, PBE-D3, and PBE-DCACP model potentials to simulate
water at 300 K. All simulations were carried out in the isobaric–isothermal
ensemble to allow the systems to find their equilibrium densities.
Sampling within the isobaric–isothermal ensemble has proved
to be an invaluable tool for accessing the relatively accurate interaction
potential. This allows one to directly reproduce the experimental
densities under various thermodynamic conditions by using an appropriate
combination of electronic parameters. The convergence of pressure
and the low-frequency volume fluctuation are the two key reasons for
not adopting this method for simulations of a larger number of particles.
Our main aim is to determine how these model potentials affect the
distribution of HDW and LDW populations and whether that can be used
to describe the dynamics of the system. We identified the HDW and
LDW on the basis of the radial distribution function (RDF), spatial
distribution function (SDF), and local structure index (LSI). We introduced
a local structure index parameter to calculate the inhomogeneity near
the end of the first solvation shell and beginning of the second solvation
shell to give us an overview of the presence of interstitial water
molecules. Calculation of the voids actually provides us with the
structural details of a system and the information about the extended
hydrogen bond network. It is well known that the environment in which
a water molecule is residing can be well described by the vibrational
spectral diffusion of hydroxyl groups of the water molecules.32 This is because the vibrational frequencies
of these modes are directly related to the strength of the bond, which
is again dependent on the surrounding of the water molecules. Therefore,
the results of spectral diffusion can be used to correlate our analysis
of HDW and LDW populations with the overall dynamics of the system.
Our work is important in the sense that the effect of first-principles
model potentials on the hydrogen bond pattern in liquid water was
analyzed in terms of the presence of HDW and LDW, which can explain
the dynamical properties.

Results and Discussion
We first
explored the liquid density of water with various electronic
parameters from the initial isothermal–isobaric simulations.
With the addition of dispersion correction, the density of liquid
water enhanced drastically. The density of BLYP-D2 is very close to
the liquid density of water. We obtain densities 765, 1021, 1095,
and 1082 kg m–3 for simulations with BLYP, BLYP-D2,
BLYP-D3, and BLYP-DCACP, respectively. Overall, BLYP functional provided
an underestimated density than that of PBE functional. The densities
792, 1026, 1108, and 1091 kg m–3 were obtained for
simulations with PBE, PBE-D2, PBE-D3, and PBE-DCACP, respectively.
The obtained densities from these methods show a remarkable spread
with respect to the experimental value due to improper description
of interactions between water molecules by functionals without dispersion
corrections. The corrected interactions provide cohesive interactions
between water molecules in the liquid state. As found for liquid water
from earlier studies,4,33,34 the density of liquid water is quite sensitive to the exchange/correlation
functional, and the noncorrected functionals estimate densities, which
are around 20% lower than the experimental one. We note that the water
density from the strongly constrained and appropriately normed density
functional based ab initio theoretical study is ≃5% larger
than that of the experimental value, and this value is a significant
improvement over the PBE and BLYP functionals.35 The analysis of structural arrangement of water molecules
with various dispersion corrections was investigated by calculating
the oxygen–oxygen radial distribution function (RDF) (Figure 1). The characteristics
peak features depend upon the choice of different functionals and
the choice of the dispersion corrections. The BLYP, BLYP-D2, BLYP-DCACP,
PBE-D2, and PBE-DCACP functionals overestimate the oxygen–oxygen
RDFs. These functionals showed higher intensity and stronger first
maxima, followed by a much deeper minima position compared to the
experimental data. The positions corresponding to first maxima of
oxygen–oxygen RDFs of PBE and PBE-D3 are very close to those
of the experimental data, whereas the first minimum position of oxygen–oxygen
RDF is in good agreement for BLYP-D3. However, the peak height is
shorter than that in the experimental data.36,37 For better understanding the RDFs, we have also calculated the spatial
distribution functions (SDFs) in which the oxygen clouds are shown
around the water molecule in the first and second solvation shells.
The calculated results for SDFs are shown in Figure 2. It is found that there is a gap between
first and second solvation shells of oxygen cloud density. The cloud
density of oxygen around the water molecule in the first solvation
shell is much denser in the case of dispersion corrected PBE functionals
with respect to the BLYP, which may be the reason for the slower dynamics
liquid water having former functionals.38,39 On further
observation, it is seen that BLYP forms a clear two-coordination shell,
whereas its dispersion corrected functionals do not have a well-formed
second coordination shell, and they are more distorted or diffused.
In case of the PBE and its dispersion corrected functionals, PBE-DCACP
seems to have little distorted two-coordination shells. The presence
of the diffused and distorted second coordination shell is an indication
of the presence of some water molecules, which are not well placed
in the first or second coordination shell and are present in between
the two coordination shells.40

Figure 1 Radial distribution
functions (solid lines) for oxygen–oxygen
pairs for BLYP and PBE functionals are shown in upper and lower panels,
respectively. The experimental data for oxygen–oxygen RDF are
shown from neutron scattering experiment by Soper at 298 K.36

Figure 2 Spatial distribution functions (SDFs) of oxygen cloud around water
molecules. The red and yellow colors represent the oxygen cloud in
the first and beyond the first solvation shell, respectively.

The gap observed in distribution
of oxygen clouds corresponding
to the first and second solvation shells of SDFs can give us an overview
of the structurally different water molecules, which primarily is
the reason for the existence of HDW and LDW. The main structural difference
between these two categories is due to the presence of the interstitial
water molecules, which can be better understood if we plot the higher
order distributions.28,41,42 Interstitial water molecules are the water molecules that are mainly
trapped between the first and second solvation shells. The quantification
of these water molecules can be done by many ways. Any change in temperature
and pressure or in the model potential will affect the hydrogen bond
interaction30 between the water molecules
and will shift the equilibrium between these two forms in a continuous
way. In HDW, the first tetrahedral shell remains unaffected, but the
second shell approaches the interstitial sites of the first shell,
resulting in HDW structures. There is a possibility of significant
overlap of the first and second solvation shells; more precisely,
it can be said that the molecules labeled as instantaneous first shell
neighbors may be second shell neighbors. Under ambient condition,
the ∠OI–O–OI distribution,
where OI is the oxygen molecule present at the first solvation
shell of the central oxygen O, peaks at about 104.5°. Ideally,
the ∠OI–O–OII angle distribution,
OII being the oxygen molecule present in the secondary
shell of O, gives two peaks at 45 and 75° under ambient pressure,
which merges to 65° with the increase in HDW population. A representative
model regarding the position of water molecules with the angle distribution
is presented in Figure 3. This shift is due to the change in the structural topology of the
second solvation shell, where the other second shell molecules are
closer to the central molecules than they would have been under ambient
pressure. High-density second shell molecules are not hydrogen bonded;
they are purely interstitial nonbonded water molecules, and generally
they make angles closer to 65°. To structure out the distribution
of the interstitial molecules, we plotted the angle distribution of
∠O–OI–OII with respect
to the O–OI and OI–OII distances involved in Figure 4. Generally, these water molecules are found in the range
between 2.7 and 3.35 Å, that is, the gap between the first and
solvation shells.13 It varies from model
to model we are using, depending upon the first minima in the RDF.
The more well defined the RDF is, the less probability of finding
interstitial water molecules. The presence of interstitial water molecules
will decrease the angle between the neighbors.40 Therefore, a careful observation of the ∠O–OI–OII in the range of 2.7–3.35 Å
(i.e., the region where the interstitial molecules are generally present)
can give us an idea of the distribution of the interstitial water
molecules present in the system. In Figure 4, we have plotted the distribution of ∠O–OI–OII with the corresponding O–OI and OI–OII distances. The x axis and the y axis show the O–OI and OI–OII distances, respectively,
and the color bar legend corresponds to the calculated angle between
O–OI–OII. Moreover, the different
colors of the contour plot denote the probability of finding a particular
value of ∠O–OI–OII. It
can be seen that at higher oxygen–oxygen distances, in the
range of 2.7–3.35 Å in the x and y axes, where the probability of finding interstitial molecules
is more, the top right-side corner of the contour plot is blue for
all of the functionals. This blue color corresponds to probability
of finding lower angles. This means that as the oxygen–oxygen
distance is increasing (toward the end of the first solvation shell),
the probability of finding some interstitial water molecules, which
make the angles smaller than the tetrahedral angle, is more. When
compared with different water models, BLYP is found to have a lesser
blue region than that of the dispersion corrected BLYP functionals.
This indicates lesser population of HDW in BLYP; however, we found
PBE-DCACP to have a considerable blue region at this distance. Therefore,
both the choice of the exchange/correlation functional and the dispersion
corrections are very sensitive toward the population of both types
of water densities.

the hydrogen-bonded and interstitial water molecules, respectively.

OI–OII distances involved with ∠O–OI–OII, as shown in Figure 3. The x axis and y axis
represent O–OI and OI–OII distances, respectively. The color ranges given in the color bar
legend are according to the values of angles.

To have a better understanding about the populations of the
HDW
and LDW water, we calculated a local structure index, S, which is defined as  where S(i,t), the local structure index
of ith oxygen at time t, shows the
distribution of oxygen
atoms placed in the second solvation shell of the ith oxygen with respect to the first solvation shell. Therefore, d(i,j) is the distance
between the ith oxygen atom with its second shell jth oxygen atom neighbor and rmin is the average value of the first solvation shell. n(i,t) is the number of jth neighboring atom of ith oxygen at time t. The first minimum of the g(r) corresponding to the first solvation shell can give an idea of rmin if the first and second solvation shells
are well defined. In Figure 5, we have plotted the probability distribution, P(S), with the distance for different water models.
A low value of S(i,t) will indicate a disordered local environment, that is, the presence
of interstitial water near the first solvation shell whose distance
is less than that of the second solvation shell. A high value of S(i,t), on the contrary,
would indicate an ordered system, which means the second neighboring
water molecules are more likely to be present at where the second
hydration shell is supposed to be. Therefore, a careful analysis of
the probability distribution function, P(S), can give us an idea of the presence of HDW population
and LDW water in different water models. Figures 4 and 5 show that apart
from BLYP, all three models, BLYP-D2, BLYP-D3, and BLYP-DCACP, have
considerable probability of finding water molecules at the described
distance distribution, which indicates that they have interstitial
water in between the second and first solvation shells. Among these
three models, BLYP-D3 has the highest probability and BLYP has the
least (Figure 5). A
careful investigation of the RDF for BLYP-D3 shows that there is a
considerable flat region after the first coordination shell. In case
of PBE and its dispersion corrected models, PBE-DCACP, PBE-D3, and
PBE-D2 show considerable probability of finding interstitial water
molecules with respect to PBE. These results are well correlated with
the SDF presented in Figure 2. Because BLYP has well-defined first and second solvation
shells, there is less probability of finding interstitial water molecules;
thus, less blue region is observed in the right-hand top corner of
the contour plot (Figure 4). For PBE-DCACP, the SDF is visibly distorted, showing considerable
presence of interstitial water.

index (S) of the secondary solvation shell oxygen
molecules with respect
to the first minimum of oxygen–oxygen RDF (first solvation

The presence of interstitial water
molecules also affects the interatomic
void space by modifying the network structure. Here, we analyzed the
voids in water molecules through the Voronoi polyhedra (VP) method,
which is one of the efficient ways by which we can analyze the structural
details of a system. Specially, it will be important for the current
study, where we are comparing different models of water differing
in the dispersion energy terms. The arrangement of the water molecules
in the coordination sphere differs a lot depending on the model potential.
From a set of configuration of atoms, we can generate a tessellation
in the three-dimensional space, known as Voronoi tessellation, named
after the scientist who invented the method.43 The tessellation consists of repetitive units of VP region of the
atoms. The units are defined as the regions consisting of all points
that are closer to the reference atom than to any other atoms. The
void radius is defined as the distance between the vertex of the VP
and the atom minus the atom radius. The other way of defining the
tessellation is Delaunay tessellation. VP and Delaunay tessellation
are complementary to each other. We considered the coordinates of
the oxygen atoms to generate the tessellation, and the Voronoi analysis
was executed by the algorithm described in refs (43−47). The plot of the probability distribution of the voids present in
the different systems is presented in Figure 6. It is seen that the methods have quite
a large impact on the void distribution of the system. This can be
actually related with the RDF of the system. Calculations of the distribution
of the voids and radial distribution function, which actually calculates
the distribution of neighboring atoms around a fixed atom, are complementary
to each other. Figure 6 shows that BLYP has more void radii than BLYP-D2 > BLYP-D3 >
BLYP-DCACP.
This implies that at a fixed distance, the water molecules in the
BLYP model will be less surrounded by neighboring water molecules
than will the BLYP-D2 model, which is further lesser than BLYP-D3
< BLYP-DCACP. This is also reflected in the calculation of the
coordination sphere of the different models. In other words, we can
say that BLYP water models are less dense than the other BLYP dispersion
corrected models. It can be also noted here that on the basis of our
Local structure index calculation, BLYP has more probability of having
LDW molecules than that of the other models. Similar types of comparison
can be made in cases of PBE, PBE-D2, PBE-D3, and PBE-DCACP. It is
found that PBE-D2 has the least void radius, followed by PBE-DCACP
< PBE ∼ PBE-D3. Further, RDF and coordination number also
reflect the same scenario. Two water models, PBE and PBE-D3, have
quite close coordination numbers, and the other two water models,
PBE-DCACP and PBE-D2, have close coordination numbers that correlate
well with the probability distribution of the void radius. Therefore,
it can be said that PBE and PBE-D3 are less crowded water models than
are PBE-DCACP and PBE-D2 in the first coordination shell. PBE-DCACP
has more HDW population than PBE. Further, we matched our result with
the spectral diffusion of the water molecules. It is found that vibrational
frequency of a water molecule is sensitive to its local solvation
environment. We correlated the data reported by Klein and co-workers39 for further discussion. The dynamics of spectral
diffusion can be calculated by frequency–time correlation and
spectral hole dynamics calculations.32 Both
of these functions have a short decay time scale (∼100 fs)
and a long decay time scale (∼2 ps) corresponding to the hydrogen
bond lifetime. The slower time scale can be related to the dynamics
of the local structural relaxation. The dynamics of the hydrogen bond
making is found to have a faster time scale of ∼100 fs; hence,
this can be correlated to the short-time dynamics of the spectral
diffusion. The long-time dynamics can be related with the hydrogen
bond dynamics of the system. On carefully comparing the three systems,
BLYP, BLYP-D2, and BLYP-D3, it can be seen that the τ2 is decreasing in the order BLYP > BLYP-D2 > BLYP-D3. These
can be
explained in terms of the interstitial water that BLYP has the least
population of interstitial water and BLYP-D3 has more, so the hydrogen
bond making and breaking become more feasible for BLYP-D3, and therefore,
the lifetime decreases. For the same reason, BLYP-DCACP shows faster
dynamics than that of BLYP and PBE shows slower dynamics than that
of PBE-DCACP.38

Conclusions
To summarize, we have explored the effects of
dispersion interactions
on the structure, density, voids, and interstitial molecules of liquid
water from the analysis of trajectories generated from first-principles
molecular dynamics simulation using CP2K at room temperature. We presented
the structural details of liquid water in terms of HDW and LDW for
BLYP as well PBE and their dispersion corrected functionals. Addition
of dispersion corrections to these functionals produced more dense
liquid as the oxygen–oxygen first coordination number is increased,
which leads to small void spaces. However, the first and second solvation
shells are not well defined on addition of dispersion correction in
case of BLYP functionals. These diffused coordination shells result
due to the presence of interstitial water molecules between the first
and secondary shells. We have plotted the spatial distribution function
(SDF), where it is seen that BLYP has more compact coordination shells
compared to that of BLYP-D3 and PBE has more compact secondary shells
compared to that of PBE-DCACP. The presence of these interstitial
water molecules gives rise to high-density water in the model functionals,
and they are found to affect the dynamics of the system as they help
in breaking and making of the hydrogen bonds quickly. We have calculated
the population of the high- and low-density water molecules for the
different functionals. BLYP-D3 was found to have the maximum population
of high-density water molecules compared to that of other BLYP functionals,
and PBE-DCACP was found to have more HDW water population than that
of PBE. It was also concluded that PBE shows slower dynamics than
that of BLYP functionals. It was seen that we can describe the time
fluctuation correlation of a hydroxyl bond in the presence of HDW
and LDW populations. In this study, our effort is to provide a quantitative
overview of the presence of interstitial water molecules in different
model potentials in terms of two different density states. We emphasize
that our results are based on the analysis within the length scale
of the second solvation shell. These observations will be different
with the variation of thermodynamic conditions; we plan to address
the subject in near future. Moreover, we want to note that water provides
an intense challenge to both the molecular simulation and experimental
techniques. A combination of accurate computational approaches, long-enough
simulations, large-enough systems, and efficient analysis of trajectory
data is required to represent water within its delicately balanced
interactions. It is clear that these requirements within the first-principles
molecular dynamics approach will be a challenge for addressing two
density states of water molecules in a relatively long length scale.

Computational
Details
FPMD simulations were carried out with the Quickstep48 routine of computer simulation package CP2K
(http://cp2k.berlios.de).
The method developed in the code employs the Gaussian plane wave method49 with a dual basis set formalism of Gaussian-type
orbitals and plane waves for the electronic density to solve the self-consistent
KS equations of DFT.3 Energies and forces
were calculated through the electronic structure part of CP2K. The
electronic structure was optimized at every step (0.5 fs) of the trajectory
following Born–Oppenheimer dynamics, so that the system is
always kept in the electronic ground state. The DFT calculations used
the Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr (BLYP)50,51 and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof52 exchange/correlation functionals with the norm conserving Goedecker–Teter–Hutter
pseudopotentials for the core electrons. A triple-zeta valence plus
doubly polarized basis set was used to obtain a good compromise between
the accuracy and computational cost. The simulations with the BLYP
and PBE functionals without any dispersion corrections have been treated
as reference systems. To investigate the influence of dispersion forces,
we performed additional MD simulations with different types of dispersion
correction methods: Grimme DFT-D2, DFT-D3, and DCACP methods. A charge
density cutoff at 600 Ry for the auxiliary plane wave basis set was
used. The system with 100 water molecules was pre-equilibrated (3
ns simulation time) using SPC/E53 forcefield
in the NVT ensemble with a density of 1000 kg m–3 with a time step of 1.0 fs to obtain the starting geometry for FPMD
simulations. This pre-equilibration period in CLMD was followed by
a geometry optimization in CP2K before starting the FPMD simulations.
The FPMD simulations were carried out in the isobaric–isothermal
(NpT) ensemble at a temperature of 300 K and an external
pressure of 1 atm. A massive Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat54 was used to control the temperature, and the
pressure was controlled via the barostat suggested by Mundy and co-workers.4 An equilibration period of 10 ps was used for
all systems, which was found to be reasonably long for the cell volume
and system energy to stabilize. Then, each system was simulated for
25 ps to know the liquid state density. During this phase of the simulations,
the volume of the simulation box was allowed to fluctuate, and the
average volume was determined from the last 20 ps of the simulation.
Subsequently, the simulations were carried out in a canonical (NVT) ensemble, keeping the box size fixed at the average
value obtained previously for a given system. For all of the simulations,
the integration time step was set to 0.5 fs. Each system was run for
another 52 ps, out of which the saved trajectory at every time step
of the last 50 ps was used for the calculations of various quantities.
