Over the years, scarcity of fresh
potable water has increased the
demand for clean water. Meanwhile, with the advent of nanotechnology,
the use of nanomaterials for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants
in wastewaters has increased. Herein, a new type of nanohybrids of
La- and Mn-codoped bismuth ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles embedded into
transition-metal carbide sheets (MXene–Ti3C2) were prepared by a low-cost double-solvent sol–gel
method and investigated for their catalytic activity in dark and photoinduced
conditions. The photoluminescence results showed that pure BFO has
the highest electron hole recombination rate as compared to all the
codoped BFO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids. The higher electron–hole
pair generation rate of the nanohybrids provides a suitable environment
for fast degradation of organic dye molecules. The band gap of the
prepared nanohybrid was tuned to 1.73 eV. Moreover, the BLFO/Ti3C2 and BLFMO-5/Ti3C2 degraded
92 and 93% of the organic pollutant, respectively, from water in dark
and remaining in the light spectrum. Therefore, these synthesized
nanohybrids could be a promising candidate for catalytic and photocatalytic
applications in future.

1 Introduction
With increasing population
and global industrialization, potential
risks associated with contaminating potable water streams have increased
tremendously. Different coloring industries discharge various kinds
of organic dyes into the freshwater streams, consequently generating
wastewaters. With the increasing demand of potable water, these organic
coloring substances must be treated in order to make water safe to
drink. Congo red (CR) is a sodium salt of benzidinediazo-bis-1-naphthylamine-4-sulfonic
acid.1 In this study, CR has been selected
because of its anionic structure and severe environmental issues.
A large number of industries such as textiles, printing, dyeing, paper,
and plastic produce CR effluents which can contaminate the freshwater
supply.1,2 If metabolized, CR can turn into benzide,
a well-known human carcinogen.3 The treatment
of CR-contaminated wastewater may also be complicated because of the
complex aromatic structure, which resists degradation.

Several
physical, chemical, and biological methods qualify for
the treatment of colored waters. These methods include adsorption,4−7 reverse osmosis,8 coagulation,9,10 biological,11 and photochemical degradation12 of organic dyes in water. Photocatalysis (photochemical
degradation) is a low-cost treatment method that uses catalysts in
order to accelerate degradation of organic dyes using sunlight. A
class of photocatalysts called semiconductor photocatalysts have also
been reported for effective degradation of organic compounds in water.12 Over the years, several semiconductor particles
such as TiO2 and ZnO2 were reported for photocatalysis.12,13 However, these materials exhibited lower photocatalytic activity
attributed to wide band gaps (∼3.2 eV for TiO2 under
visible light). Many heterogeneous and hierarchical photocatalysts
were reported previously for degradation of different dyes such as
CR, methyl orange (MO), cyanide, rhodamine B (RhB), p-chlorophenol, norfloxacin, and phenol. As the UV and visible lights
constitute 3–5 and 43% of the solar
light spectrum, respectively,13−16 developing new catalysts for visible light photocatalysis
are of great interests.

In semiconducting materials, bismuth
ferrites, BiFeO3 (called BFO hereafter), have shown promising
results for photocatalysis
using visible light irradiation attributed to their narrow band gap
(∼2.2 eV).17−19 The band gap in BFOs can be further improved by doping
with other ions,18,20 which alternatively improves
its photocatalytic activity under the visible light irradiation. At
room temperature, BFOs exhibit rhombohedrally distorted perovskite
structure (R3c),21 with lattice parameters arh = 3.965Å and rhombohedral angle of αrh = 89.3°–89.4°.22 In hexagonal space, the hexagonal lattice parameters
of BFOs are ahex = 5.58 Å and chex = 13.90 Å.23,24 Doping BFOs with other metallic atoms such a lanthanum (La) and
manganese (Mn) not only affects the lattice structure of BFOs25,26 but also improves magnetoelectric coupling.27−29 La- and Mn-doped
BFO shows a mesoporous network with more internal surface area and
higher photocatalytic activity compared to a nonporous pure BFO system.
La doping into BFO tuned the band gap from 2.08 to 2.04 eV, whereas
Mn doping on Fe sites showed a large band gap tunability: the band
gap was tuned up to 1.49 eV and increased the surface area.30−32 The codoped BFOs have revealed improved photocatalytic activity,33,34 which is required to degrade pollutants such as organic dyes in
wastewater under UV and visible light irradiation.19,33,34

The nanocomposites of BFOs with graphene
derivatives and metal-codoped
BFOs have shown improved photocatalytic activity.20,35 With the discovery of graphene in 2004, a two-dimensional (2D) sheet
of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, a new era has emerged with
the drive to discover unique 2D materials. Several new 2D materials
have been proposed to serve for a large number of potential applications.36−38 These 2D materials gained enormous attention because of their very
high surface area and electronic properties compared to their bulk
counterparts. Largely studied 2D materials include graphene,39,40 boron nitride,41−43 and transition-metal dichalcogenides,44,45 which are essentially derived from 3D layered materials. Recently,
a new 2D layered material composed of transition-metal carbides and
carbonitrides, also called as MXenes, has attracted considerable attention
from the research community.46−49 MXenes are represented by the general formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M stands for an early transition
metal such as Ti, Cr, and Mo; X is either carbon or nitrogen; and
T represents surface functionality such as −O, −OH,
and/or −F. The first reported MXene was Ti3C2Tx, which further led to the synthesis of additional 19 potentially
important but different variations in the MXene family. MXenes are
considered significant for applications in nanoelectronic devices
and catalysis in future.46−49

There have been a few reports on photochemical
degradation of organic
pollutants using BFOs. For example, Soltani and Lee reported the photocatalytic
degradation of aqueous bisphenol A using nanohybrids of BiFeO3/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanohybrids.50 A complete degradation of bisphenol A was observed in 70
min under the visible light irradiation. Wang et al. also reported
a complete degradation of bisphenol A using Bi25FeO40/rGO nanocomposites in 180 min under similar irradiation.51 Dai et al.52 reported
a very low degradation of MO (50% degradation) in 6 h using BiFeO3/GO nanohybrid. In this study, we reported the synthesis of
a highly efficient nanohybrid from lanthanum (La)- and manganese (Mn)-codoped
bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) abbreviated as BFO nanoparticles
embedded into transition-metal carbide sheets (MXene–Ti3C2) and investigated for their catalytic activity
against CR under dark and visible light conditions. The nanohybrids
were synthesized by a low-cost double-solvent sol–gel method.
The microstructures, surface morphology, and electronic properties
of the nanohybrids were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
respectively. The charge carrier recombination rate of nanohybrids
was measured using photoluminescence (PL) technique. The MXene–Ti3C2 attachment and codoping of BFOs provided a suitable
environment for fast degradation of CR. A high degradation rate of
CR (∼92%) was observed.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Structure and Morphology of Nanohybrids
X-ray diffractometer
was used to study the phase morphology of
the synthesized nanohybrids. The doped BFO nanohybrids defined as,
Bi0.9La0.1FeO3 (BLFO), Bi0.9La0.1Fe0.95Mn0.05O3 (BLFMO-5),
Bi0.9La0.1Fe0.90Mn0.10O3 (BLFMO-10), Bi0.9La0.1Fe0.80Mn0.20O3 (BLFMO-20), and Bi0.9La0.1Fe0.75Mn0.25O3 (BLFMO-25)
with Ti3C2–MXene, were synthesized. The
microstructure of nanohybrids was studied using XRD (Figure 1). The pure BFO matches the
JCPDS card no. 20-0169 for BiFeO3 structure. All diffraction
peaks were indexed as rhombohedral, corresponding to (012), (104),
(110), (006), (202), (024), (116), (112), (018), and (214) reflections.
The doublet peak at 32° merged into a single peak showing structural
transformation from rhombohedral to orthorhombic. La and Mn doping
causes the diffraction peaks to vanish, related to planes (006) and
(018). Overall, the peaks shifted toward right for Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3 compared
to that in pure BFO. However, the dual diffraction peaks of planes
(104) and (110) occurring at 2θ = 31.6° and 32.01°
were reduced in intensity and merged as the concentration of Mn was
increased in BLFO as shown in Figure 1b, a similar trend was observed elsewhere.1,30 The average particle sizes were calculated using Scherrer’s
formula53D = kλ/β cos θ, where D =
crystallite size, k = Debye constant, λ = wavelength
of X-ray, and β = fwhm. For pure BFO, BLFO, BLFMO-5, BLFMO-10,
BLFMO-20, and BLFMO-25, the average particle sizes are 46.32, 33.89,
27.68, 26.65, 22.96, and 30.15 nm respectively. There was a reduction
in average particle size from pure BFO up to BLFMO-20 as Mn doping
increased; however, larger particles were observed for BLFMO-25.

Figure 1 (a) XRD
patterns of Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3 (x = 0.1, y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.25)/Ti3C2–MXene nanohybrids and (b) magnified patterns ranging
from 30° to 34°.

The surface morphology of hybrids (Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMyO3/Ti3C2) was studied using SEM (Figure 2). In BLFO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids
(Figure 2a), the only
dopant is the La, where the dopants are La and Mn as in BLFMO (Figure 2b–e). MXene
(Ti3C2) showed a sheetlike structure observed
in all microimages where the sheets were ∼1–1.5 μm
wide and 2–3 μm
in the lateral dimensions. The nanoparticles (codoped BFO particles
(Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMyO3)) were embedded on the surfaces of Ti3C2 sheets. Despite improved catalytic activity (later),
there was no regular pattern of the distribution of nanoparticles
on Ti3C2 sheets observed in SEM images. Briefly,
the BLFO particles (Figure 1a) formed a coagulated structure on the Ti3C2 sheets with approximately 0.8 μm cluster size. In BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids, Mn concentration was increased,
which further reduced the distribution of BLFMO particles on Ti3C2 sheets, and some sheets had lesser attached
particles.

Figure 2 SEM images of (a) BLFO/Ti3C2, (b) BLFMO-5/Ti3C2, (c) BLFMO-10/Ti3C2, (d)
BLFMO-20/Ti3C2, and (e) BLFMO-25/Ti3C2.

In addition, the average
nanoparticle size (from XRD) ranged 22–33 nm, whereas SEM showed
large clustering of the nanoparticles. There were a few grains which
were not nucleated and observed distributed over the sheets. The BLFO/Ti3C2 nanohybrid exhibited a uniform growth of the
BFO nanoparticles compared to the BLFMO/Ti3C2 samples with Mn doping (Figure 2b–e).

Figure 3 shows the
PL spectra of the Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3/Ti3C2 nanohybrids.
All the samples of pure BFO, Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMyO3/Ti3C2, were tested for the PL spectra. Considering the PL peaks
showing the recombination rate of the separated charge carriers, the
pure BFO showed the highest electron hole recombination rate as compared
to all the codoped BFO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids. A
low-intensity peak in the PL spectrum indicates a lower electron–hole
recombination rate and consequently high photocatalytic activity of
the material. The opposite is true for the high-intensity peak observed
in PL spectra. A very low PL peak was observed for BLFO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids. Also, the electron–hole recombination
rate was lower for all BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids
compared to that of pure BFO particles, which is attributed to enhanced
surface area and larger active points present on Ti3C2 sheets. Increasing the concentration of Mn doping lowered
the recombination rate significantly, bringing it almost similar to
that of the BLFO/Ti3C2 nanohybrid level.

Figure 3 PL spectra
of pure BFO and Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMyO3/Ti3C2–MXene
nanohybrids.

The radicals produced
in BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids
are due to activation of nanoparticles. The generation of electron–hole
pairs, as the light falls, at first excites the electrons from valence
band to the conduction band (CB). The CB of semiconductors has more
than one energy band. Liqiang et al. explained the dependence of photocatalytic
activity on the PL spectra of semiconductor materials.54 The working mechanism of hybrid is such that
the charge carriers produced are suddenly spread over the Ti3C2 sheets occupying the larger areas of the Ti3C2 sheets. The charge carriers spread on the sheets further
significantly enhance the surface redox reactions of the Ti3C2 sheets. The BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids
have higher surface areas compared to neat BFO nanoparticles. Attaching
BFO particles on MXene surface along with doping has significantly
lowered the recombination rate of charge carriers and a higher surface
area of the nanohybrids is expected. These results are in agreement
with previous reports on BFO/graphene nanohybrids where higher surface
area and higher photogeneration/lower recombination rate were observed,
providing the higher photocatalytic activity.50−52,55

2.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS analysis is used to check the chemical composition and binding
energies of different elements present in the synthesized hybrid structure. Figure 4 shows the XPS analysis
of the prepared nanohybrid (BLFMO-5/Ti3C2).
In order to confirm the newly proposed nanohybrids, the XPS survey
scans were conducted on a represented sample of BLFMO-5/Ti3C2 containing La and Mn doping. Survey scans (Figure 4a) indicated the
presence of Bi, Fe, O, Ti, La, Mn, and C with their respective binding
energies in the synthesized BLFMO-5/Ti3C2 nanohybrid.
A very small signal attributed to La was detected at about binding
energy (BE) 840 eV. Mn peak is attributed to BE 682 eV, while Bi and
O shows intense peaks at 159 and 531 eV, respectively, which are explained
in the discussion later.

Figure 4 XPS analysis of BLFMO-5 sample. Survey scan
(a), high-resolution
scan for Bi (b), Fe 2p (c), O 1s (d), C 1s (e), and deconvolution
of the O 1s high-resolution XPS scan (f).

The high-resolution scans were also performed for Bi, Fe,
O, and
C in codoped nanohybrids shown in Figure 4b–e. The high-resolution XPS scan
for Bi 4f was in the BE range of 156–167 eV (Figure 4b). Two sharp peaks were observed:
BE ≈ 158.9 and 164.2 eV, representing Bi 4f7/2 and
Bi 4f5/2, respectively. Further stating, Bi is in the Bi3+ oxidation state.31Figure 4c shows the high-resolution
spectrum for Fe over BE range of 707–728 eV. Similar to Bi
spectrum, two peaks were observed at 710.7 and 724.4 eV, attributed
to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, indicating the formation
of Fe2+ ions; in a previous report, Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks of pure BFO were at 714.5 and 728
eV, respectively, and due to La doping Fe 2p3/2 shifted
to lower BE near to 710 eV.31,56,57 More oxygen vacancies should be produced because of the presence
of Fe ions of such valence states on the surface of BFO, which enhances
the surface adsorption of the organic and oxygen species on the BFO
surface.58,59Figure 4d represents high-resolution O1 spectrum. The photocatalytic
mechanism is a series of redox reactions that occur on the surface
of the material, and oxygen species is an important part of the process.
The O 1s high-resolution spectra were deconvoluted and fitted using
the Lorentzian–Gaussian curves (Figure 4f). Three peaks were observed from the curve
fitting: the peak at BE ≈ 529 eV (because of the lattice oxygen
atoms), the peak at BE ≈ 531 eV is attributed to hydroxyl oxygen,
and the third peak at BE ≈ 532 eV is attributed to the surface-adsorbed
oxygen species.60,61 During photocatalytic reactions,
higher content of hydroxyl species is required to produce reactive
oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical •OH–.62Figure 4e represents a high-resolution C1 spectrum.
A sharp peak at BE ≈ 284.8 eV was further deconvoluted into
two peaks for C–C and C–O bonds (not shown).50,63

2.3 Diffusive Reflectance Spectroscopy of Nanohybrids
The light absorption properties of BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids were investigated via diffuse reflectance UV (DR-UV)
spectroscopy. Band gap energies (EBG)
were calculated from the extrapolation of the linear range obtained
from modified Kubelka–Munk function [F(R)hν]0.5 versus photon energy, hν.64 Significant band
gap narrowing was observed for BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids
in comparison to the bare BFO nanoparticles. EBG of bare BFO nanoparticles were given as 2.04 eV, in good
agreement with literature values.19,20 BLFMO/Ti3C2 composites showed band gaps between 1.3 and
1.5 eV. In particular, 1.30 eV was calculated for BLFO/Ti3C2, whereas for BLFMO-20/Ti3C2,
the band gap was 1.48 eV (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Tauc plot of BLFMO-20/Ti3C2–MXene
from DR-UV spectroscopy.

Precise EBG assessment of the
rest
of BLFMO/Ti3C2 series was not possible because
of the difficulty in discerning the onset of the decrease, which may
be attributed to a small amount of impurity phases.12,35

The narrowing of the band gap in nanohybrids in comparison
with
bare BFO nanoparticles can be explained through the formation of Fe–O–C
bonds at the surface of BLFM, which reduces the charge transfer from
oxygen ion to Fe ions.35 Analogous band
gap narrowing was observed in literature for graphene/BiFeO3 nanohybrids.65 The superior band gap
narrowing of BLFO/Ti3C2 is indicative of better
coupling of the BLFO nanoparticles and Ti3C2 sheets, which was illustrated through SEM images.

2.4 Catalytic Degradation
O2 and OH radicals
on the organic matter help in the degradation of
the organic pollutants. These highly active radicals start degrading
the organic pollutants present in the water solution and in turn reduce
to harmless byproducts (CO2 and H2O). The general
mechanism of combining electrons (e–) with O2 and holes (h+) with OH– produces
super oxides and free hydroxyl radicals, respectively, consequently
removing dye from the liquid solution.66

Figure 6a shows
the catalytic activity (under dark conditions) and photocatalytic
activity of the Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3/Ti3C2 nanohybrids
(irradiated). The relative concentration of the CR dye versus the
irradiation time for various nanohybrids is represented. All the nanohybrids
showed improved dye degradation as compared to the neat BFO nanoparticles.
Neat BFO nanoparticles exhibited 10% dye degradation under dark conditions,
which reached to a maximum of 40% at 90 min of irradiation after which
no change in dye concentration was observed. Pure MXene–Ti3C2 exhibited 12% dye degradation in 120 min reported
previously.67 In Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3 nanoparticles,
BLFMO-5/MXene showed the best degradation under dark conditions, which
did not change much when irradiated.30 Here,
the best catalytic activity was observed for BLFO/Ti3C2 and BLFMO-5/Ti3C2 where BLFO/Ti3C2 reduced the CR concentration to ∼92%
in dark whereas an ∼93% reduction in CR concentration was observed
for BLFMO-5/Ti3C2 in dark. Both nanohybrids
reached to almost 100% degradation when irradiated within 30 min of
irradiation. Both of these nanohybrids proved to be the best reducing
catalysts of CR.

Figure 6 (a) Photocatalytic degradation of CR by BLFO/Ti3C2–MXene, and BLFMO/Ti3C2–MXene
nanohybrids against the time taken and (b) BLFO–Ti3C2 dye degradation curves for four cycles.

Most of the dye degradation was achieved under
dark conditions,
which might be attributed to the adsorption effect of CR on BLFMO/Ti3C2 nanohybrids. The enhanced catalytic effect was
exhibited by the combined structure of the codoped BFO with MXene–Ti3C2 sheets. As stated earlier in the XPS discussion,
the nanohybrid is enriched with oxygen species such as hydroxyl ions
and adsorbed oxygen, which consequently enhances the photocatalytic
activity on the surface of the material. Exfoliated MXene–Ti3C2 as reported earlier with a surface area of 39
m2 g–1 might have increased the active
sites on the nanohybrid for reactive species for the adsorption effect68,69 as larger surface area provides more space to dye molecules to get
adsorbed and degraded easily and quickly.35,70,71

The produced nanohybrids showed better
catalytic activity compared
to previously reported hybrid systems. Previous research reported
the BLFMO/GNP nanohybrids for CR removal in which the best catalyst
in their report is BLFO/GNP graphene nanoplatelet, which took 30 min
to degrade the CR completely and another BLFMO-20/GNP nanohybrid degraded
76% CR dye in dark with complete degradation in about 120 min. Another
report showed BLFMO/GO nanohybrids for the CR dye degradation; the
best catalyst BLFMO-15/GO degraded 96% CR dye in 30 min. In another
report, researchers showed the photocatalysts for the degradation
of RhB. Their best produced catalyst Au–CdS degraded the RhB
in 90 min. Graphene-wrapped TiO2 (graphene-w-TiO2) was reported as the best photocatalyst for the degradation of methylene
blue (MB) in 90 min. A system of MoS2/rGO aerogel was produced
to photodegrade chromium(VI) in about 120 min. A Ag–CdS–TiO2 nanotube system was produced to degrade MB under ultra violet
(UV) light, which degraded MB in 120 min.20,72−77

Under photocatalytic conditions, the generation of electron–hole
pairs by visible light irradiation produces O2 and OH radicals.
These highly active radicals start degrading the organic pollutants
present in the water solution and in turn reduce to harmless byproducts
(CO2 and H2O). In the general mechanism, photoexcited
BLFO/Ti3C2 produces electron–hole paired
charge carriers as in eq 1. Large surfaces may possibly have many active sites, which might
increase the possibility of maximum interactions between the dye molecules
and the nanohybrid. Once the process starts, the superoxide anion
radicals •O2– can be
produced, and meanwhile, •OH– radicals
can be produced by the reaction of OH– with holes.12,16,20,30,66,72,73,78−80

As the electrons react with the catalyst, the H2O molecules
are converted into OH. The radicals produced in the process, that
is, •O2– and •OH–, being highly reactive for the organic pollutants
such as CR, degrade it to the harmless byproducts that are CO2 and H2O. The mechanism of degradation is given
by the equations below 1   2   3   4   5   6  

The recyclability
of the nanohybrids was also investigated for
one nanohybrid structure (BLFO/MXene) as shown in Figure 6b. The nanohybrid was removed
from the dye solution, washed, and reused in four consecutive cycles
in order to show its potential regeneration in continuous applications.
During each cycle, there was negligible reduction in the catalytic
efficiency. This result further proves that the synthesized catalyst
does not degrade itself, and it can be regenerated efficiently for
extended applications. However, further experiments will be conducted
later in order to understand the recyclability of these catalysts
(a separate manuscript will be submitted later).

3 Materials and Methods
Salts of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate
(Bi(NO3)3.5H2O, 99% pure), iron nitrate
(Fe(NO3)3.9H2O, 98.5% pure), ethylene
glycol (C2H6O2, 99%), acetic acid
(C2H4O2, 99.5%), and hydrofluoric
acid (HF, 39 wt %) were used
as received.

3.1 Synthesis of MXene–Ti3C2 Sheets
Multilayered sheets of Ti3C2Tx were fabricated from pure Ti3AlC2 (MAX phase) using the following procedure: approximately 3 g of
Ti3AlC2 powder was dissolved in 70 mL of HF
(39 wt %) in a closed Teflon bottle and stirred magnetically for 60
h at room temperature. Solids were removed from the Teflon bottle,
filtered under vacuum, and subsequently washed with deionized (DI)
water and ethanol until a pH ≈ 6 was reached. Finally, the
washed residue was dried in a convection oven at 60 °C for 6
h. The residue obtained was MXene–Ti3C2 sheets with formula Ti3C2.

3.2 Synthesis of Doped BFO Nanoparticles
The Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3 (abbreviated
as BLFMO, x = 0.1, y = 0.0, 0.05,
0.10, 0.20, and 0.25), named here in as BLFO,
BLFMO-5, BLFMO-10, BLFMO-20, and BLFMO-25, nanoparticles were synthesized
using a double-solvent sol–gel method. Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate
and lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate were stoichiometrically were dissolved
in equimolar acetic acid and ethylene glycol and magnetically stirred
for 90 m at 40 °C. A mixture of iron nitrate nonhydrate powder
and manganous nitrate solution (50%) was also dissolved in acetic
acid under constant stirring for 90 m at 40 °C. Both solutions
were mixed in a single flask and stirred for another 180 m at 40 °C
until a uniform, reddish brown precursor solution (0.4 M) was produced.
In order to compensate for Bi loss during the heating process, solutions
containing 3% excess Bi were prepared. Ethylene glycol was used to
maintain constant electronegativities of iron and bismuth during the
chemical reaction, whereas acetic acid acted as a catalyst to maintain
the solution concentration and for controlled chemical reaction during
the synthesis process. The as-prepared solution was dried in a convection
oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain a gel which was calcined in
a furnace at 600 °C for 3 h. After calcination was completed,
the powder was crushed to obtain a homogeneous fine powder.

3.3 Synthesis of MXene-Based Nanohybrids
The nanohybrids
were fabricated using a double-solvent sol–gel
technique. MXene–Ti3C2 solution was made
in DI water with the molarity of 0.5 mg/mL, followed by ultrasonication
for 10 min. The codoped BFO nanoparticles (Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3) were
dissolved in a mixture of ethylene glycol and acetic acid with a 1:1
ratio and 0.01 M molarity. The Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3 solutions were
ultrasonicated for 1 h at 60 °C; then, the solutions of Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3 were mixed with Ti3C2 solutions separately
for all hybrids, and then the Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3/MXene–Ti3C2 solutions were stirred magnetically for 2 h
at 80 °C for coprecipitation synthesis. The products were washed
with DI water several times and dried at 60 °C for 3 h.

4 Characterization
Samples were analyzed for their structure
using the XRD, Cu Kα
radiation source (Rigaku 2500, Japan). The samples were analyzed for
a range of 10°–70°. Surface and morphology of hybrids
were investigated using field-emission SEM (FESEM, JEOL7001F). To
avoid the charging effect, platinum was sputter-coated on the nanohybrid
before FESEM exposure. PL spectroscopy was performed to calculate
the generation/recombination rate of the carrier. Binding energies
of elements present in the hybrid were checked using XPS. The solid-state
diffuse reflectance UV/vis spectra of the La-, Mn-codoped BFO nanoparticles
were recorded with a double-beam UV/vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Cary 5000, Varian) equipped with a diffuse reflection accessory (Praying
Mantis, Harrick). Baseline correction was achieved using a BaSO4 standard. Approximately, 50 mg of each sample was dispersed
in 150 mg of BaSO4 for the measurement. The reflectance
was converted to the Kubelka Munk function F(R) with Cary WinUV software.

4.1 Photocatalytic
Characterization
The
codoped nanohybrids were tested for their photocatalytic dye degradation
application. The apparatus detailed as Hitachi (UV-3310) UV–vis
spectrophotometer is used to test the photocatalytic property of the
nanohybrids. An amount of 100 mg of nanohybrids was used to be tested
in the prepared solution of 100 mL of CR so that the concentration
of the dye solution is taken as 100 mg L–1 and the
solution is put into stirring in dark condition for about 120 min.
As to ignore the thermal degradation activity, the solution is put
in the ice bath under constant stirring.12,30 Visible light is taken from the xenon lamp (300 W), a 5 W light-emitting
diode was used for UV (ultraviolet) source. Every 30 min, an amount
of 3 mL of the solution is taken out from the main solution during
the complete process; the taken amount was centrifuged at 7000 rpm
to get the supernatant. The supernatant is then used to check the
concentration of CR using the Hitachi UV-3310 UV–vis spectroscope,
and the curve is measured at a specific wavelength of 496 nm.30 The efficiency of the degradation can be measured
using the formula  

Here, Co shows the initial concentration
of the dye and Ct shows the concentration
of the dye at specific times.81

5 Conclusions
La- and Mn-codoped BFO nanohybrids with
various doping concentrations
were successfully synthesized using a double-solvent sol–gel
method. The 2D MXene–Ti3C2 sheets were
synthesized from their pure MAX phase via selective etching of aluminum.
The Bi1–xLaxFe1–yMnyO3/Ti3C2 nanohybrids were
fabricated using the double-solvent sol–gel technique. Nanohybrids
showed large electron–hole pair generation and low recombination
time compared to pure BFO nanoparticles. The nanohybrids were further
tested for catalytic and photocatalytic degradation of CR. The best
catalytic activity was observed under dark conditions where >90%
CR
degradation was observed; BLFO/Ti3C2 and BLFMO-5/Ti3C2 degraded the 92 and 93% dye in dark, respectively,
and further complete (100%) degradation within 20 min of irradiation.
Furthermore, these nanohybrid catalysts are regenerative and work
efficiently without losing their catalytic activity up to four cycles.
The hybrids reported are novel and best candidates for catalytic activities,
which makes them potential candidates for commercial applications
owing to its low-cost synthesis route.
