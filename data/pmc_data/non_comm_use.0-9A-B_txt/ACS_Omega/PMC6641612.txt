Bismuth vanadate
(BiVO4) is a promising candidate as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst in
the aspect of practical applications. To investigate the origin of
active species from BiVO4 and understand the influence
of the variations of the photocatalytic process, comparative studies
on zero-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (NGQD)-decorated
BiVO4 have been carried out for methylene blue photodegradation.
It was found that the hydroxyl group-rich NGQD surface and the established
heterojunction structure between NGQDs and BiVO4 were greatly
beneficial for the conversion of the •OH radical.
With NGQD decoration, the dominant oxidant species for NGQDs/BiVO4 were confirmed to be •OH and H2O2, rather than holes originating from the valence band
of unmodified BiVO4. The synergistic photocatalytic mechanism
with respect to the interfacial charge transport and the conversion
of active species was proposed. The achievement of the controllable
active species significantly altering the activity may be applied
for different photocatalytic reactions.

Introduction
Photocatalysis with
semiconductor materials has attracted considerable
interests in the past decades due to the potential applications in
solar fuel production, environmental clean-up, water purification,
etc.1 Among various semiconductor materials,
bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) mixed transition-metal oxide with
a bandgap of ∼2.4 eV has been recognized as one of the excellent
visible-light-response photocatalysts. The material can be capable
of harvesting up to 11% of the solar spectrum but also possesses a
strong oxidation property with chemical/photochemical stability. To
date, it has been extensively used in various photocatalytic fields,
such as elimination of organic pollutants2,3 and
photoelectrochemical tandem cell.4−6 However, unmodified BiVO4 usually shows low photocatalytic activity due to the high
electron–hole recombination rate, poor charge transport, and
slow surface reaction kinetics.7,8 To address the factors
limiting the performance of BiVO4, the modification approaches
have been demonstrated to be necessary, such as decomposition of electrocatalysts
(noble metals, carbon materials, cobalt phosphate, layered double
hydroxide, etc.),9−11 metal or nonmetal doping (W, Mo, C, P, etc.),12−15 and combination with other semiconductors (Si, WO3, etc.).5,16 Yet, the surface chemistry of BiVO4 has not been well
described and the generation of the active species during photocatalytic
processes is still in debate in the literature.17−19

Inspired
by recent significant advancements in the synthesis of
zero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) associated with the
remarkable quantum-confinement and edge effects,20,21 GQDs have been used as a new type of electron-acceptor material
for photocatalysis and solar cell applications.22−24 More interestingly,
through atomic-scale tailoring, nitrogen-doped GQDs (NGQDs) could
drastically alter their electronic characteristics and offer more
active sites, thereby producing new phenomena and unusual properties.25,26 On the basis of the aforementioned argument on BiVO4,
it is highly desirable for the construction of the NGQD-decorated
BiVO4 to clarify the origin of active species on unmodified
BiVO4 and the effects of NGQDs. In particular, the variation
of the generated active species during the photocatalytic process
is almost unknown so far.

Herein, we report, for the first time,
the facile preparation of
the NGQDs/BiVO4 nanojunction photocatalysts by an ultrasonic-assisted
method, which allows the successful deposition and uniform dispersion
of NGQDs on the surface of BiVO4 nanocrystals. Effects
of NGQDs on the physicochemical property, optical property, electronic
structure, and photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene
blue (MB) were systematically studied. The surface effect of NGQDs,
that is, the presence of plentiful hydroxyl groups, was found to be
beneficial for the conversion of the •OH radical
and the homogeneous dispersion on BiVO4. The estimation
of the band positions of both NGQDs and BiVO4 revealed
that the NGQDs acted as a junction component in the established heterojunction
structure with BiVO4. Furthermore, the formation of H2O2 and •OH active species was
probed, and the synergistic photocatalytic mechanism of NGQDs/BiVO4 related to the interfacial charge transport and variation
of active species during the photocatalytic process was also discussed
in detail.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows representative
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), and autocorrelated HRTEM lattice images
of the pristine NGQDs (Figure 1a–d) and 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 (Figure 1e–h). Note that the
autocorrelated HRTEM lattice images were recorded from the corresponding
selected areas in the HRTEM image (marked by a white rectangle). Figure 1a,b shows that the
NGQDs have a uniform size ranging from 1.5 to 4 nm (inset of Figure 1a), with a small
portion of aggregates of about 20 nm. The lattice fringes of 0.34
and 0.24 nm correspond to the (002) and (1120) plane of the graphite
form, respectively (Figure 1c,d). The TEM image of 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 (Figure 1d) shows clear evidence
for the deposition of NGQDs on the surface of BiVO4 nanoparticles.
The HRTEM (Figure 1e) and the autocorrelated HRTEM lattice images (Figure 1g–h) show the clear
lattice fringes of 0.24 and 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (1120) plane
of NGQDs and (200) plane of BiVO4, respectively. The results
unambiguously reveal the formation of an intimate contact between
NGQDs and BiVO4 components in the composite.

of the pristine NGQDs. The autocorrelated HRTEM lattice images of
the pristine NGQDs (c, d) are recorded from the corresponding selected
areas in the HRTEM image (b). Autocorrelated HRTEM lattice images
of the NGQDs (g) and BiVO4 (h) in the composite are marked
in the corresponding selected areas of the HRTEM image (f).

Similar X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns (Figure S1) were obtained for the pristine NGQDs, BiVO4,
and NGQD-decorated BiVO4, indicating negligible change
on the BiVO4 crystal structure by the introduction of NGQDs.
The diffraction peaks of all samples can be ascribed to the monoclinic
BiVO4 phase (JCPDS card 75-1867). As expected, no diffraction
peaks of NGQDs were observed in the XRD patterns of NGQDs/BiVO4 composites. This can be ascribed to the low loading and the
high dispersion of NGQDs on the surface of BiVO4.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the pristine NGQDs,
BiVO4, and 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 are shown in Figure S2. The spectrum of NGQDs shows that a
broad absorption band at 3000–3500 cm–1 can
be assigned to the stretching vibrations of O–H and N–H,
and the stretching vibration of C–H is displayed at ∼2998
cm–1.27,28 In the low-wavenumber
region, two bands at 1667 and 1575 cm–1 are attributed
to the vibrational absorption band of C–O in COOH and CONH
and the bending vibrations of C–C, respectively.29 For the pristine BiVO4, the strong
absorption bands at ∼548 and 735 cm–1 are
the characteristic bending vibration of the Bi–O bands30,31 and asymmetric stretching vibration of V–O bands.32 The results imply that there are plenty of hydroxyl
and amino groups on the surface of NGQDs; in contrast, the hydroxyl
groups are scarcely formed on BiVO4. The hydroxyl groups
play an important role in the formation of •OH during
the photocatalytic process, as will be discussed in detail below.
The FTIR spectrum of 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 is similar to that
of pristine BiVO4, and the characteristic peaks of NGQDs
cannot be clearly observed, which is probably due to the overlap of
the spectra.

The UV–vis absorption spectrum of the pristine
BiVO4 (Figure 2a)
shows an absorption edge at around 550 nm, corresponding to the effective
bandgap of 2.25 eV. Figure 2b shows the UV–vis–NIR absorption spectrum of
NGQDs. Apparently in the UV region, there are three absorption peaks
located at approximately 218 nm (5.68 eV), 269 nm (4.60 eV), and 378
nm (3.27 eV), corresponding to the π–π* transitions
from of C=C and C=N and n−π* transition
of the p−π orbit between the aromatic nitrogen and the
conjugate structure, respectively. As shown in the enlarged resultant
spectrum of NGQDs in the wavelength range from 650 to 950 nm (inset
of Figure 2b), the
absorption threshold of ∼793 nm is clearly observed with a
long tail absorption upon about 830 nm. It may be ascribed to the
sub-bandgap transitions associated with the surface functional groups
of NGQDs. The behavior is in good accordance with the results previously
reported on surface-modified TiO2.33,34 Therefore, the bandgap between the top of the valence and bottom
of the conduction band characteristic of the NGQDs can be determined
to be ca. 1.56 eV. Consistently, the photograph shows a blue-green
color of the NGQDs solution (Figure S3).
For the NGQDs/BiVO4 composites, an increased light-absorption
capability and extended absorption onset are clearly observed in the
visible region, along with the increase of the NGQD content (Figure 2a). With the benefits
of the optical properties of NGQDs, the enhanced light absorption
can refer to the higher production of electron–hole pairs under
the same light irradiation condition.

absorption spectra
and Tauc plots (inset) of the as-synthesized samples. (b) UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectrum of NGQDs (inset: the enlarged spectrum in the
wavelength range of 650–950 nm).

The optimization of NGQD loading was studied from 2.5 to
10 wt
% for photocatalytic degradation of MB. Figure 3 displays the NGQD dose-dependent variation
trend of the MB absorption capacity in the dark and the photodegradation
rate constants under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).
The blank reaction without catalysts confirmed that the self-degradation
of MB was negligible. A very high absorption ability was observed
for the pristine NGQDs in the dark, owing to its unique properties,
that is, size effect, plenty of surface sites, etc. Under irradiation,
it was found to be photoactive, but a poor photocatalytic activity
was observed. It may be ascribed to the intrinsic property for photogenerated
charge separation or the deactivation caused by the possible agglomeration
of NGQDs.35 With increasing the loading
content of NGQDs, the absorption capacities and degradation rates
of the NGQDs/BiVO4 composites were obviously increased
and reached the optima at 5 wt % of NGQDs. Compared to that of the
pristine BiVO4 (0.51% min–1), nearly
twofold enhancement in the photodegradation rate constant was achieved
for the 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 composite (1.14% min–1). However, a large dose usage of NGQDs led to a significant decrease
of the absorption capacity and photocatalytic performance in the 10
wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 composite. The results indicated that
the rational proportion of NGQDs/BiVO4 had a crucial impact
on the improvement of the absorption capacity and degradation rate.
Otherwise, the reduction of synergistic efficacy between NGQDs and
BiVO4 and the deteriorative particle agglomeration occurred.36 Besides, the light-screening effect of NGQDs
can also be considered to be the possible reason, which partially
blocked the visible-light absorption of BiVO4.37,38 Furthermore, the addition of H2O2 (10 mg L–1) in a parallel reaction enhanced the MB degradation
rate of 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4, suggesting the role of H2O2 as an effective active species in scavenging
the photogenerated electrons and accelerating the photo-oxidation
process.

process under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) over
the
as-synthesized samples. (b) Degradation rate constants of MB over
the as-synthesized samples as fitted by using the first-order kinetics
equation (ln(C0/Ct) = kt).

To further validate the synergistic effect of NGQDs, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky analysis measurements
were conducted on the as-prepared NGQDs/F-doped SnO2 (FTO)
electrode, and the corresponding conduction band (ECB) and valence band (EVB)
energy potentials can be estimated to be approximately +0.38 V versus
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and +1.94 V versus RHE, respectively
(Figure 4). In contrast,
according to the Butler and Ginley method (detailed calculations given
in Supporting Information),39 the positions of the ECB and EVB potentials of BiVO4 can be calculated to be about +0.47 and +2.72 eV, respectively.
The results reveal that the suitable band positions between NGQDs
and BiVO4 would be favorable for the establishment of the
heterojunction structure. The photoactive NGQDs acted as a junction
component, which is different from the well-known function of GQDs
as a sole electron acceptor (as will also be discussed in detail later).40

frequencies from 100 to 200 Hz with a three-electrode system in a
0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.5).

To gain more insight on the photocatalytic reaction
process of
the NGQD-decorated BiVO4, schematic illustration of the
proposed photocatalytic mechanism related to the interfacial charge
transport and the generation of active species is shown in Figure 5a. The •OH trapping experiments by terephthalic acid (TA) photoluminescence
(PL) probing were performed (Figure 5b,c). Under visible-light irradiation (λ >
420
nm), (1) both BiVO4 and NGQDs can be excitated and simultaneously
the holes (h+) and electrons (e–) were
produced. (2) The photogenerated electrons on NGQDs can smoothly transfer
to BiVO4 via the formed interfaces, due to the relatively
low ECB potential of BiVO4.
(3) Because the ECB potentials of NGQDs
and BiVO4 are both located between the redox potential
O2/O2•– (−0.33
eV vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and O2/H2O2 (+0.69 eV vs NHE), the consumption of the electrons
involving molecular oxygen may proceed via the two-electron reaction
for the formation of H2O2, instead of O2•– via a single-electron reaction.
(4) Simultaneously, the holes on the surface of BiVO4 can
easily transfer to NGQDs via the interfaces, as the EVB potential of NGQDs is much more negative than that
of BiVO4. As a result, the built-in type II junction structure
was formed between NGQDs and BiVO4. (5) In the case of
BiVO4, the surface photogenerated holes were directly trapped
to react with adsorbed MB species on the condition they did not recombine
with electrons because no obvious PL signal of •OH was observed (Figure 5b). This indicated that the generation of •OH was very scarce, which is in agreement with the reported results.18 The observation can be explained by two main
reasons. First, the EVB of BiVO4 (+2.72 eV vs NHE) is located too closely to the redox couples •OH/H2O (+2.7 eV vs NHE), and the generation
of •OH via •OH/H2O
may be prohibited. Second, the lack of surface-adsorbed OH groups
(OH–ads) on BiVO4 as demonstrated
by FTIR spectra would dramatically limit the generation of •OH via oxidation of OH–ads, even though
the EVB of BiVO4 is much more
positive than the redox couples •OH/OH– (1.9 eV vs NHE). In contrast, the holes accumulated in the EVB of NGQDs (+1.94 V) can react with the surface-adsorbed
OH groups (OH–ads) of NGQDs to generate
a large amount of •OH, showing a strong PL signal
of •OH from the NGQDs/BiVO4 (Figure 5c). We would like
to note that the PL results also gave reliable evidence for the semiconducting
characteristics of NGQDs with an opening bandgap,41,42 rather than an electron acceptor or ever sensitizer. The induced
interfacial hole transfer from BiVO4 to NGQDs promoted
the generation of •OH and greatly contributed to
the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation rate. (6) Presumably
owing to the excessive consumption of electrons for the formation
of H2O2 via the two-electron reaction, no superfluous
electrons can further react with H2O2 to form •OH. H2O2 as a characteristic
of oxidative species would directly participate in the photocatalytic
reaction. The decoration of a small amount of NGQDs not only increased
the dye absorption capacity and visible-light-harvesting capacity
but also facilitated the transfer and separation of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs by aid of the built-in type II junction
structure. Moreover, the results imply that the dominant oxidant species
for NGQDs/BiVO4 were converted to H2O2 and the •OH radical rather than holes from the
valence band of BiVO4. The formation of active species
can be controlled during photocatalytic reactions, which may be useful
for different photocatalytic applications.

The observed PL peak at about 360 nm originated from the sampling
capillary glass tube.43

The recyclability of the photocatalyst is an important
parameter
of the photocatalytic process for practical photocatalytic application.
After each cycle, fresh MB solution was used for the next photocatalytic
experiment, and taking into account the loss of the photocatalyst
during the sampling process, the photocatalyst was collected from
previous parallel experiments, followed by centrifugally washing and
drying at 80 °C overnight. Figure 6 shows the recycling test of 5 wt % NGQDs/BiVO4 and the corresponding first-order kinetic fitting curves
(insets). A slight decrease in the degradation rate was observed after
being used repetitively for three cycles. It unveiled that the NGQDs/BiVO4 nanocomposite was kept undamaged and the NGQDs remained tightly
anchored on the surface of BiVO4. Therefore, the nanocomposite
could be recognized as a stable photocatalyst, showing a good potential
in the practical application for decomposing organic contaminant pollutants.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel NGQDs/BiVO4 nanojunction
photocatalyst
was prepared by a simple method. The positive influence of NGQDs on
the physicochemical, optical, and electrical properties of NGQDs/BiVO4 has been demonstrated. The decoration of the optimum amount
of 5 wt % NGQDs on BiVO4 not only enhanced the absorption
capacity and visible-light-harvesting capacity but also facilitated
the interfacial charge transport by aid of the built-in type II junction
structure. More interestingly, the conversion of the dominant active
species during the photocatalytic process can be achieved after the
decoration of NGQDs. This study on the new understanding of the photocatalytic
mechanism will provide insights into the design of new photocatalytic
materials with a required electronic property. Note that by exploitation
of a new synthetic approach and control of technical parameters, the
development of high-quality NGQDs will be one of the major concerns
in the ongoing and future work for extending the great potential in
the photocatalysis field.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Photocatalysts
All reagents used in
this study were used without further purification. According to the
literature,23 the high-quality BiVO4 nanoparticles were synthesized in an acidic environment,44 where BiVO4 photocatalysts have been
proven to be more active than those prepared under higher pH conditions.
Typically, 10 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (American Chemical Society (ACS) reagent, ≥98%; Alfa Aesar)
and 5 mmol of V2O5 (≥99.6%; Alfa Aesar)
were mixed in 50 mL of 0.75 M HNO3 solution. The resulting
yellow product was collected by filtration and dried at 80 °C
overnight. The NGQDs were reproducibly prepared according to the one-pot
hydrothermal method reported by Sun and coworkers:29 0.63 g of anhydrous citric acid (ACS reagent, ≥99.5%;
Alfa Aesar) and 0.54 g of urea (ACS reagent, 99.0–100.5%; Alfa
Aesar) were dissolved in 40 mL of water under stirring. The resulting
solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave.
The sealed autoclave was heated at 180 °C for 6 h in an electric
oven. The final product was centrifuged several times at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. The obtained NGQD supernatants were redispersed in
30 mL of water for further use, and the concentration of the NGQD
solution was calculated to be about 43 mg mL–1 from
balance measurements after drying at 80 °C overnight. The ultrasonic-assisted
method was used for the preparation of NGQDs/BiVO4 photocatalysts.
Briefly, a desired weight ratio of NGQDs and BiVO4 was
added into ethanol. The bottle was placed in an ultrasonic bath for
2 h and then vigorously stirred for another 2 h. After drying at 80
°C overnight, the resultant powders were directly heated at 180
°C for 2 h in a tube oven under an argon atmosphere (quality
5.0).

Fabrication of NGQD Electrodes
The NGQDs/FTO electrodes
were fabricated by the modified electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method.45 Typically, 10 mL of NGQDs suspension (40 mg
mL–1) was prepared in 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol
by sonication for 6 h, followed by adding 0.005 g of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (≥98%; Alfa Aesar) into
the suspension with an ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h. A clean FTO
(as cathode) facing the stainless steel anode was immersed into this
suspension. The distance between the two electrodes was fixed at about
5 cm. The Mg2+-absorbed NGQD suspension was loaded in a
quartz vessel as the electrolyte, and the electrophoresis process
was performed at 50 V for 120 s. After the EPD process, the prepared
NGQDs/FTO electrodes were washed by ethanol and deionized water several
times and dried in an argon stream at room temperature.

Characterization
The XRD patterns of all samples were
recorded with a PANalytical MPD diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.1541 nm), and the data were recorded from 10 to 70°
(2θ). Powder samples were examined by scanning electron microscopes
using a LEO (Zeiss) 1530 Gemini field-emission. TEM images were recorded
by a Philips/FEI Tecnai F20 S-TWIN TEM instrument operating at 200
kV. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the as-synthesized powdered
samples were measured using BaSO4 as a reference on a Shimadzu
UV-2450 spectrophotometer. Bandgap energies were calculated by the
analysis of the Tauc plots resulting from Kubelka–Munk transformation
of the absorption spectra. The absorption spectrum of the NGQD solution
was recorded by UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy (PerkinElmer
LAMBDA 750) at room temperature. FTIR spectroscopy was performed on
a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer using the typical potassium
bromide (KBr) pellet technique. The PL spectra were recorded at room
temperature by using a HORIBA LabRam HR spectrometer with the 325
nm line of the He–Cd laser as the excitation source.

Evaluation
of Photocatalytic Activity
MB (Aladdin Chemical
Reagent Corporation, Shanghai, China) was adopted as a hazardous organic
pollutant. The evaluation of photocatalytic activity of the samples
was performed on a home-built multizone photocatalytic reaction system,
which consists of eight parallel windows and a 500 W midpressure Hg
lamp (Hg Arc lamp source; Shanghai Bilon Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
P. R. China) equipped with a water filter and a 420 nm cutoff filter
as a visible-light irradiation source. In a typical run, 10 mg of
catalysts was added into 50 mL of a 10.0 mg L–1 MB
solution. Before irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred
in the dark to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
of MB on the surface of the photocatalyst. Approximately 2 mL of the
suspension was collected at certain time intervals and then centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The concentration change of the MB
solution was determined using a UV/vis spectrophotometer by monitoring
its characteristic absorption peak at 665 nm.

Detection of Hydroxyl Radicals
(•OH)
Generation of •OH during the photocatalytic process
was detected by the PL technique using TA as the probe molecule. TA
can react with highly reactive •OH to form highly
fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, which can be used to decompose,
for example, organic pollutants. Experimental procedures were similar
to the measurement of photodegradation, except that the MB solution
was replaced by a freshly prepared mixed solution (0.05 mM TA and
0.2 mM NaOH). Typically, the powder samples (20 mg) were dispersed
in the TA solution (20 mL) and when irradiated under visible light
for a certain time interval, a negligible amount of the reaction solution
was sampled by a capillary glass tube and measured on a HORIBA LabRam
HR spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm.

Mott–Schottky
Analysis
The EIS were measured
by a potentiostat (Interface 1000 potentiostat; Gamry Instruments)
with a three-electrode system in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.5). The potential was measured against an Ag/AgCl
reference and converted to NHE potentials by using E(NHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V. In the case of the
Mott–Schottky analysis, it can be estimated from the intersection
of a plot of 1/C2 against E by the following equation 1  where C is the space charge
capacitance (F cm–2), e is the
elementary charge (1.62 × 10–19 C), ϵ
the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ϵ0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.85 × 10–12 N–1 C2 m–2), N is an acceptor density, E is the applied
potential (V), k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38
× 10–23 J K–1), and T is the absolute temperature (K).
