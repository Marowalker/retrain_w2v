Gut microbiome plays
an essential role in host health through host–gut
microbiota metabolic interactions. Desirable modulation of beneficial
gut bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, can confer health benefits by altering microbiome-related metabolic
profiles. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a
black raspberry-rich diet to reshape the gut microbiome by selectively
boosting A. muciniphila population
in C57BL/6J mice. Remarkable changes of the mouse gut microbiome were
revealed at both compositional and functional levels with an expected
increase of A. muciniphila in concert
with a profound impact on multiple gut microbiome-related functions,
including vitamin biosynthesis, aromatic amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate
metabolism, and oxidative stress. These functional alterations in
the gut microbiome by an easily accessed freeze-dried black raspberry-supplemented
diet may provide novel insights on the improvement of human health
via gut microbiome modulation.

Introduction
Our gut microbiota,
which consists of up to 100 trillion microorganisms,
encodes 100 times more genes than our own genome.1 The human body interacts with the gut bacteria in numerous
ways. For instance, microbial fermentation of dietary fiber produces
short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate,
which are not only energy substrates but also involved in diverse
signaling pathways.2 However, growing evidence
shows that the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions can be readily
perturbed by exposure to environmental toxic agents, such as heavy
metals or pesticides.3−5 Disrupted gut microbiome (dysbiosis) is frequently
associated with adverse health outcomes, such as obesity or a compromised
immune system,6,7 and we define such perturbed gut
microbiome as an unhealthy one. An unhealthy gut microbiome caused
by environmental insults would lead to numerous adverse health effects,
and its compositional and functional characteristics can be partially
responsible. For example, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in gut microbial composition is associated
with obesity and the gut microbiome in obese individuals has enhanced
microbial functions for energy extraction than that present in lean
individuals.8 Bäckhed et al. described
the healthy microbiome as a microbial community with structure and
function that presumably confer health benefits for the host.9 Therefore, it is of significance to be able to
modulate the gut microbiome toward a bacterial community profile that
promotes “healthy” outcomes. Currently, a simple, effective,
and selective approach with the potential for broad applicability
has not been adequately explored yet. In recent years, a series of
patterns for gut microbiome alterations associated with various diseases
have been documented but the functional impact of those changes still
remains elusive.9 A number of gut bacteria
have proven health-associated functions and clinical efficacy. For
instance, probiotic strains present in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera are able to confer a
health benefit in human when treating gastrointestinal disorders.9 Thus, encouraging beneficial and inhibiting detrimental
bacteria would be a reasonable approach to transform the gut microbiome
into one that confers health benefits, and the investigation on the
consequent functional changes resulting from compositional alterations
is also warranted.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated
that Akkermansia muciniphila, commonly
found in human
and mouse gut microbiome, plays a key role in regulating glucose homeostasis,
inflammation, gut barrier function, adipose tissue metabolism, fat
mass storage, and host metabolic functions in diverse animal models
and human.10−20 It has been shown that the development of obesity and associated
metabolic disorders could be attenuated by A. muciniphila treatment.18 In this context, methods
to selectively increase A. muciniphila are highly desired. We propose a simple approach for the modulation
of the gut microbiome by boosting A. muciniphila with a black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis, BRB)-rich diet. We hypothesize that BRBs could lead to a notable
increase of A. muciniphila, thus modulating
the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions to provide health benefits
to the host. We used whole, ripe, freeze-dried BRBs in this study
with the intent to increase A. muciniphila, hence reshaping the mouse gut microbiome. The rationale for this
choice is that it has been reported that the gut microbiota was shifted
in rats fed with a diet supplemented with freeze-dried berries.21,22 In particular, oligofructose and polyphenols are both abundant in
berry fruits and administration of oligofructose and dietary polyphenols
can increase the A. muciniphila population
in mice.23,24 Given the pivotal role played by the gut
microbiome in human health as well as the ability of BRBs to modify
the gut microbiota, the BRBs have the potential to modulate mouse
gut microbiome by increasing the beneficial gut bacteria, such as A. muciniphila, hence promoting host health and decreasing
disease risk. Furthermore, it is also relevant and applicable to elucidate
metabolic function changes associated with the gut microbiome modulation
by BRBs.

In the present study, a BRB-rich diet was employed
to directionally
modulate the mouse gut microbiome. We combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and shotgun metagenomics sequencing to investigate the interplay between
the gut microbiome and the BRB-supplemented diet. The gut microbial
profiles after 7 week BRB diet examined by 16S rRNA sequencing and
metagenomics sequencing showed a significantly altered gut microbial
composition in C57BL/6 mice with a 157-fold A. muciniphila in concert with a remarkable impact on the microbiome-related functions,
including vitamin biosynthesis, aromatic amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate
metabolism, and oxidative stress, that can potentially influence host
health.

Results
The American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-76A
diet and BRB diet
(formulated on AIN-76A with 10% BRB powder) used in the present study
were also used in previous studies for the potential chemopreventive
agents in BRBs, for instance, simple and complex phenols or sterols.25 It has been reported that the BRB diet is able
to ameliorate ulcerative colitis and esophageal tumorigenesis in animal
models.26,27 However, the functional effects of the BRB
diet on the gut microbiome have not been examined. With an increasingly
strong link between the gut microbiome and human health, characterization
of the functional changes driven by the BRB diet in the gut microbiome
may provide mechanistic insights regarding the effects by black raspberries
on host health and disease. In addition, oligofructose and polyphenols
are both important components in berry fruits. Administration of oligofructose
and dietary polyphenols can boost the A. muciniphila population in mice,23,24 it is expected to see boosted A. muciniphila after the BRB diet treatment.

Composition
and Diversity of Mouse Gut Microbial Communities
Were Strikingly Impacted Following Consumption of a BRB-Rich Diet
Taxonomic summary bar plots (Figures 1A and S1) show
the identified gut bacteria assigned at the phylum level from 16S
rRNA sequencing reads, with each color representing a bacterial phylum.
The abundance of several bacterial phyla and the general composition
of mouse gut microbiota were distinctly different between the control
and BRB diet groups. In the control group, Firmicutes (83.41 ± 5.97%) and Bacteroidetes (9.49 ±
4.24%) covered the majority of the mouse gut microbes, followed by Actinobacteria (2.00 ± 1.09%), Tenericutes (0.12 ± 0.13%), Verrucomicrobia (<0.01%),
and Proteobacteria (<0.01%). In contrast, in the
BRB group, the abundance of the Firmicutes was reduced
to 29.68 ± 9.92%, whereas the Bacteroidetes was
increased to 17.18 ± 3.79%. This notable ratio change of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is consistent
with the previous study that lower Firmicutes and
higher Bacteroidetes were observed in lean subjects.28 Other bacterial phyla found in the gut microbiota
of BRB-fed mice were Actinobacteria (1.68 ±
0.69%), Tenericutes (0.18 ± 0.17%), and Proteobacteria (<0.01%). In particular, the abundance
of Verrucomicrobia (50.50 ± 10.65%) was remarkably
higher compared to that in the control group. The jackknifed beta
diversity and hierarchical clustering analysis via the unweighted
pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) (Figure 1B) indicated that the control and BRB diet
groups were typically clustered into their groups. Consistently, three-dimensional
principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot (Figure 1C) shows that the structure of gut microbial
community is distinct from each other. The control and BRB groups
were well separated and clustered together in their distinct groups;
89.83, 3.81, and 1.92% variation were explained by principle component
(PC)1, PC2, and PC3, respectively. In addition, Figure S2 shows the gut bacterial genera that were altered
significantly after BRB diet treatment compared to controls (p < 0.05). There were 17 altered genera in total, with
7 increased and 10 decreased genera. Interestingly, all 10 decreased
bacterial genera were from phylum Firmicutes, whereas
2 genera from phylum Bacteroidetes significantly
increased, which is consistent with a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.

clustering analysis by UPGMA with the UPGMA distance tree constructed
at a distance of 0.1. (C) Three-dimensional PCoA plot, based on the
UniFrac distance metric and beta diversity, shows that the BRB diet
and control group are well separated.

Highly Enriched A. muciniphila Population
and Functional Metagenome Comparison
As hypothesized,
the normalized gene counts show that the A. muciniphila population in the mouse gut microbiome increased by approximately
157-fold in the BRB group compared to that in control (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the gut microbiome-related
functions have been profoundly altered by BRBs supported by the gut
bacterial metagenome comparisons. Figure 2B shows that several metabolic subsystems
at level 1 of the SEED subsystem were significantly changed in the
mouse gut microbiome, including photosynthesis, potassium metabolism,
secondary metabolism, and sulfur metabolism. In particular, bacterial
functions related to the biosynthesis of vitamins and aromatic amino
acids exhibited significant enrichment. Carbohydrate metabolism, especially
sugar alcohol and di- and oligosaccharide utilization, was also significantly
changed. In addition, several bacterial genes encoding antioxidative
enzymes, as well as programmed cell death (PCD) proteins, were shifted
between the control and BRB diet groups.

diet groups. (B) Comparative
metagenomic analysis at the level 1 SEED subsystem with photosynthesis,

being significantly altered by BRB treatment (p <
0.05).

Enrichment of Genes Involved
in Vitamin Synthesis
The
gut microbiome is an important source of vitamins (especially vitamins
B and K) that are essential to human health.29 In this study, we discovered a significant enrichment of bacteria
genes encoding key enzymes involved in the pathways of vitamin synthesis. Figure 3 displays the abundance
distribution of genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of riboflavin,
folate, and vitamin K. The relative abundances of GTP cyclohydrolase
II and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase, which are rate-limiting
enzymes in riboflavin synthesis,30 significantly
increased in the BRB diet group compared to those in controls. Likewise,
a series of genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of
folate and vitamin K (phylloquinone and menaquinone) were also significantly
enriched (p < 0.05). Besides these, the relative
abundances of bacterial genes of the biosynthesis of other vitamins
or cofactors, such as vitamin B1 (thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase),
pterin (dihydropteridine reductase), and lipoic acid (lipoate synthase),
were all significantly enriched in the BRB diet group compared to
those in controls (Figure 3).

in the gut microbiome of mice fed on the BRB diet. (All comparisons
listed are statistically significant, p < 0.05.)

Enrichment of Genes Involved
in Aromatic Amino Acid Synthesis
We next looked into the
gut bacterial synthesis of amino acids.
The metabolism of aromatic amino acid was significantly enriched with
BRB diet treatment. The synthesis of chorismate, an important precursor
for aromatic amino acids, was elevated with multiple genes encoding
its biosynthetic enzymes being enriched (Figure 4). Likewise, the relative abundances of bacterial
genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine
and tyrosine significantly increased. In addition, the biosynthesis
of tryptophan, which is an essential amino acid, was also enriched
in the BRB diet group. Specifically, the bacterial gene encoding the
β subunit of tryptophan synthase that catalyzes the last two
steps in tryptophan biosynthesis was enhanced.31 In addition, the relative abundances of genes encoding
tryptophan-biosynthetic enzymes, such as anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase,
indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase, anthranilate synthase, and phosphoribosylanthranilate
isomerase, were all significantly elevated.

genes involved in aromatic amino acid
metabolism in the gut microbiome of mice fed on the BRB diet. (All
comparisons listed are statistically significant, p < 0.05.)

BRBs Decreased Bacterial
Genes Involved in Sugar Alcohol and
Di- and Oligosaccharide Utilization
A significant decrease
in the abundance of genes involved in sugar alcohol and di- and oligosaccharide
utilization was found in mouse gut microbiome of the BRB diet group
compared to that in the control. Specifically, for sugar alcohols,
the utilization of propanediol, ethanolamine, glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate,
and mannitol decreased (Figure 5). Meanwhile, for di- and oligosaccharides, the utilization
of trehalose, fructooligosaccharides and raffinose, sucrose, lactose,
and galactose also significantly decreased (Figure 6). This obvious reduction in sugar alcohol
and di- and oligosaccharide utilization indicated significant downregulation
in an extensive repertoire of gut bacterial genes involved in the
utilization of a variety of sugars and might influence the carbohydrate
metabolism and energy extraction efficiency in gut microbiota.

gut bacterial genes involved in sugar alcohol utilization

listed are statistically significant, p < 0.05.)

Figure 6 Reduction of gut bacterial genes involved in
di- and oligosaccharide
utilization in the gut microbiome of mice fed on the BRB diet. (All
comparisons listed are statistically significant, p < 0.05.)

Enrichment of Genes Encoding
Antioxidative Enzymes and Reduced
Programmed Cell Death (PCD)
We compared several genes encoding
antioxidative enzymes in gut bacteria between the BRB diet and control
groups. As shown in Figure 7A, the relative abundances of catalase, cytochrome c551 peroxidase,
and superoxide dismutase (Fe) were significantly upregulated in the
BRB group compared to those in the control. In addition, the relative
abundances of PCD system toxin genes mazF and ydcE decreased in the BRB diet group, whereas antitoxin
genes mazE and ydcD did not show
significant difference (Figure 7B). Toxin–antitoxin systems are the most studied forms
of PCD in bacteria. For example, the mazEF module found in Escherichia coli is a typical toxin–antitoxin
system that triggers PCD.32 The mazEF system
comprises two adjacent genes mazE and mazF, encoding an antitoxin and a toxin, respectively.33 The mediation of the mazEF system could trigger PCD under
conditions, such as oxidative stress.34 Meanwhile, the ydcDE system found in Bacillus subtilis is very similar to the mazEF system with ydcD and ydcE encoding an antitoxin and a toxin, respectively.35 Together, these data indicate that the antioxidative
capacity of the gut bacteria was reinforced and the progress of PCD
was inhibited.

Discussion
Mounting
evidence shows that host health and susceptibility to
diseases can be greatly influenced by the developmental trajectory
of the gut bacteria, including alterations of the microorganisms and
their collective genomes.36 To improve
the host fitness through effective modulation of the gut microbiome
is of importance for the protection from metabolic disorders associated
with dysbiosis. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an effective
approach by which we can directionally modify the gut microbiota,
particularly its associated functions. In this study, we used high-throughput
16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics gene sequencing
to investigate the effects of a simple approach for the modulation
of gut microbiome with a BRB-rich diet. The results clearly demonstrated
that the structure of the mouse gut microbial community changed by
the BRB diet treatment with enriched A. muciniphila population, more importantly, the gut microbial metagenome experienced
significant changes that could potentially confer benefits for the
host by altering bacterial metabolic functions. These findings supported
our hypothesis that BRB is able to modulate mouse gut microbiome probably
by inducing A. muciniphila population
and may provide novel insights regarding the gut microbiome as a therapeutic
target to develop new and effective approaches to cope with gut microbiome-related
adverse outcomes.

An easily accessed freeze-dried black raspberry-supplemented
diet
was used to selectively increase A. muciniphila, hence modulating the mouse gut microbiome. This selection is grounded
in the fact that BRB is associated with many beneficial health effects,
and more importantly, the abundance of A. muciniphila can be potentially boosted by BRBs. Specifically, after 7 week BRB
diet treatment, we identified a notable increase of A. muciniphila by 157-fold compared to that in controls.
In addition, the functional metagenome profiles were also significantly
changed after the BRB diet treatment, with metabolic alterations in
bacterial pathways involved in vitamin synthesis, aromatic amino acid
synthesis, carbohydrate utilization, and oxidative stress, indicating
that the BRB diet not only induced alterations in the gut microbiota
at the abundance level, but also had a profound impact on its metabolic
functions.

It is previously reported that obesity is associated
with the ratio
of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes.
In particular, the abundance of Bacteroidetes is
lower, whereas the abundance of Firmicutes is higher
in obese than that in lean subjects.28 The
compositional pattern of gut microbiota in mice fed with BRB diet
is opposite to that observed in obesity. The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is lower in the BRB group compared
to that in controls. Likewise, it is previously reported that the A. muciniphila population decreased in obese children
and increased after weight loss and was negatively correlated with
BMI.37−39 In the present study, the A. muciniphila population was highly induced by BRB. Along with the progress of
obesity, besides a characteristic bacterial compositional pattern,
a series of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome,
would ensue,40 suggesting an association
between the changing trajectory of gut bacteria and the deterioration
of metabolic disorders. Thus, it is likely that the development of
metabolic disorders could be reversed by the gut microbiome modulation
and its functional reprogramming. That the abundance of Firmicutes decreased, whereas Bacteroidetes increased in mice
fed with BRB diet in the present study may imply less susceptibility
to metabolic disorders. In addition, it is suggested recently that
the gut microbiome plays an important role in the development of obesity
through its capacity for energy harvest from the diet.28 Carbohydrate utilization is considered to be
involved in the energy metabolism of the gut microbiota, hence affecting
its efficiency of energy extraction. After the BRB diet treatment,
we discovered a major decrease in carbohydrate utilization especially
sugar alcohols and di- and oligosaccharides in mouse gut microbiome,
which indicated alterations in bacterial energy extraction efficiency
and carbohydrate utilization strategy. Therefore, BRB may have the
potential to protect the host from metabolic deterioration by steering
the developmental trajectory of gut microbiota in a direction opposite
to that in obesity.

Gut microbiome modulation by BRB can benefit
the host health through
enhanced bacterial biosynthesis of important biomolecules, such as
vitamins and essential amino acids. These biomolecules play an indispensable
role in maintaining cellular functions of the host; however, most
of them cannot be synthesized by human body.41 Therefore, the deficiency or even suboptimal levels would inevitably
result in health problems.42 In this study,
we discovered that the abundance of multiple bacterial genes encoding
key enzymes involved in biosynthesis of vitamin K, riboflavin, and
folate were significantly upregulated in the BRB diet group. Modulation
of the gut microbiome could be a novel approach to optimize the body
level of vitamins. For example, sufficient body levels of folate would
prevent neural tube defects42 and folate
can be obtained via the gut bacterial biosynthesis. Likewise, a recent
study suggested that besides vitamin D, vitamin K can also improve
health by conferring protective effects on cardiovascular and skeletal
systems, hence decreasing osteoporosis risk.43 The gut microbiome exerts impact not only within the gastrointestinal
tract but also on bone health, which manifested the idea that a series
of host–microbe metabolic axes connect the gut microbiome and
distant organs, such as liver, bone, and brain, via metabolic interactions.36 In addition, bacterial genes involved in tryptophan
synthesis also showed significant enrichment. As an essential amino
acid, tryptophan is linked to the regulation of food intake, mood
disorders, and immune responses.44 Clearly,
improved bacterial production of vital biomolecules would confer health
effects; thus, these findings may provide new insights regarding the
micronutrient supplement via gut microbiome modulation.

As expected,
highly enriched A. muciniphila population
(157-fold compared to controls) was induced by BRBs in
the mouse gut microbiota, far more than its usual constitution in
mouse cecal microbial community.45A. muciniphila was first described as a new strain
with mucin-degrading ability in 2004 and has been linked to human
health ever since.46 For example, increased
expression of genes involved in immune response was shown in mice
with colonization of A. muciniphila.45 Likewise, the abundance of A. muciniphila is negatively correlated with body
weight and type 1 diabetes in human and mice.10 In the present study, we achieved a remarkable A.
muciniphila increase in mice fed with the BRB diet.
As a typical mucin-degrading bacterium, A. muciniphila is capable of using mucin as carbon, nitrogen, and energy sources.46 And in the epithelial tissue of intestine, goblet
cells are responsible for the major mucin production.47 Previous studies showed that the number of goblet cells
and the thickness of mucosal tissue increased in rats fed with oligofructose.48 Therefore, oligofructose, commonly found in
berry fruits,49 may be the key factor for
the increase of A. muciniphila for
its capability to induce mucin production. The hypothesis is supported
by the study in which administration of oligofructose increased the A. muciniphila population ∼100 times, which
is comparable to the present study.23 Another
study enumerated mycolytic bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease
patients and discovered that A. muciniphila decreased, whereas another two mucolytic bacteria Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus
torques increased.50 In
the present study, the BRB diet group showed an increase of A. muciniphila and decrease of Ruminococcus (Figure S2). In addition, lower levels
of A. muciniphila population was recognized
in patients with metabolic disorders.19 Increased A. muciniphila is also
associated with decreased inflammation in mice.51 Given the antiobesity and antidiabetes functions of A. muciniphila, modulation of gut bacteria by increasing A. muciniphila abundance may attenuate or even eliminate
metabolic disorders.

As demonstrated above, the mouse gut microbiome
was substantially
changed by BRBs at both compositional and functional levels, with
a range of potential beneficial effects resulting from bacterial metabolic
alterations. Many studies focused on the perturbation and dysfunction
of the gut microbiome caused by environmental stress or imbalanced
diets. However, a better comprehension of the host–gut microbiome
interactions would lead us to develop therapeutic strategies via desirable
modulation of gut bacterial metabolism. The BRB diet used in this
study to modulate the mouse gut microbiome is only a pilot example
that the gut bacteria can be shaped and optimized for human health.
More importantly, we demonstrated that it is of promise to improve
host health through the interplay between the gut microbiome and host
via effective interventions, although answers to the underlying mechanisms
of the gut microbiome change as well as the realization of precise
manipulation of gut bacterial functions await future studies.

Materials
and Methods
Animals and BRB Diet Preparation
A total of 20 specific-pathogen
free C57BL/6 mice (∼8 week old), purchased from Jackson Laboratories,
were housed in the animal facility of the University of Georgia for
1 week to acclimate with standard pelleted rodent diet and tap water
ad libitum provided (protocol number: A2013 06-033-Y3-A3). The BRB
diet was prepared essentially as described in ref (52). Briefly, whole ripe BRBs
of the Jewel variety were freeze-dried and ground into powder. BRB
powder was stored at −20 °C until being incorporated into
custom purified American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-76A animal diet
pellets (protein, 20.8 kcal %; carbohydrate, 67.7 kcal %; and fat,
11.5 kcal %)53 by 10% w/w concentration
at the expense of corn starch. The diets were stored at 4 °C
until being fed to animals. In the beginning of the diet treatment,
mice were randomly assigned to either control (AIN-76A diet) or treatment
group (BRB diet). They were housed under the environmental conditions
of 22 °C, 40–70% humidity, and a 12:12 h light/dark cycle
and were provided water ad libitum throughout the experiment period.
Regular monitoring for health conditions was twice a week. After 7
weeks, fecal samples from individual mouse were collected and kept
at −80 °C immediately for further analysis. The animal
protocol was approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.

16S rRNA Gene Sequencing
16S rRNA
gene sequencing was
performed as described in ref (3). DNA was isolated from fecal pellets of individual mouse
using PowerSoil DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Then, the DNA was amplified using 515F and 806R primers54 targeting the V4 regions of 16S rRNA of bacteria,
followed by normalization, barcoding procedure, and finally was pooled
to construct the sequencing library. The resultant DNA was quantified
using Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq
(500 cycles v2 kit) in the Georgia Genomics Facility of University
of Georgia. Paired-reads were assembled using the Geneious software
(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand), and operational taxonomic unit
picking and diversity analysis was conducted using the Quantitative
Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software.

Shotgun Metagenomics
Sequencing
Shotgun metagenomics
sequencing was performed as described in ref (4). DNA (10 ng/μL) of
individual mouse was fragmented using a Bioruptor UCD-300 sonication
device and then the library was constructed using the Kapa Hyper Prep
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The resultant
DNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and then sequenced
using an Illumina NextSeq high-output flow cell in the Georgia Genomics
Facility of University of Georgia. Raw sequencing data were uploaded
into the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology
(MG-RAST, version 3.6) for automated taxonomic and functional profiling
with RefSeq and subsystems databases, respectively.55 A p value <0.05 was considered indicative
of a significant difference between two groups.

Statistical
Analysis of Data
Principle coordinate analysis
(PCoA) was applied to differentiate the gut microbiome profiles between
control and treatment samples, which examines the difference of beta
diversity based on the UniFrac distance metric.56 Also, we used the jackknifed beta diversity and hierarchical
clustering analysis via unweighted pair group method with arithmetic
mean (UPGMA) to compare the gut microbiome profiles between the control
and treatment group. Moreover, the difference of gut microbial composition
was assessed by a nonparametric test via the Metastats software (http://metastats.cbcb.umd.edu/), as described previously.57 The metagenomic
sequence count data for taxonomic analysis were processed using DESeq2
for statistics analysis.58
