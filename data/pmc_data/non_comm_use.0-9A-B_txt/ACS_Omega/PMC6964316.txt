A simple and convergent way to synthesize 2-amino-6-bromonaphthalenes
involves
condensation of free secondary amines with the corresponding 2-naphthol
under Bucherer conditions. The amination protocol relies on common
Teflon-capped pressure flasks and has been used to modify the tertiary
aminonaphthalene core of DANPY, a biocompatible chromophore shown
to be safe and effective for staining a variety of cellular targets.
Following a Suzuki reaction with pyridine 4-boronic acid, additional
diversity is introduced upon N-alkylation to install
the pyridinium cation. New DANPY derivatives and intermediates reported
herein reflect the modularity of the dye nucleus, including the addition
of groups useful for applications in membrane staining and DNA-based
biophotonics.

Introduction
Dyes with nonlinear optical (NLO) activity1 are of interest for both photonic systems2 and a number of imaging techniques in living
cells.3,4 The fluorescent dye molecule DANPY-15 is both NLO-active and biocompatible, possessing
a range of other useful properties such as low toxicity, high photostability,
and high sensitivity of its absorbance and fluorescence properties
to its dielectric environment.5 First intended
for use in DNA-based photonic systems,6,7 DANPY-1 was
designed8 by joining structural features
of the common intercalating agent ethidium bromide9,10 with
those of the NLO-active dye DAST11,12 (Figure 1). The structure
strikes a compromise among features that promote optical nonlinearity
(a maximally extended π bridge) and affinity for DNA (a polycyclic
pyridinium cation). DANPY-1 is similar to the zwitterionic membrane
dye BNBP,13 but it lacks a captive anion
and has shorter alkyl groups to reduce steric hindrance upon approach
to DNA.

Figure 1 Various “push–pull” DNA dye molecules cited
herein.

The core dialkylaminonaphthylpyridinium (DANPY)
chromophore consists of a tertiary aromatic amine coupled to a para-substituted pyridinium cation. The dye’s optical
properties are dominated by charge-transfer excitation in which naphthylamine
acts as an electron donor and quaternary pyridinium acts as an acceptor.
This “push–pull” asymmetry also introduces anharmonicity
to the dye’s polarization response in an applied electric field,
giving it a substantial dipole moment (μ) and first hyperpolarizability
(β). A large hyperpolarizability is conducive to NLO processes
such as the electro-optic effect14,15 and second
harmonic generation.3,4

After disclosing an extensive
evaluation of the structural, photophysical, and DNA-binding properties
exhibited by the trimethylated fluorophore DANPY-1,5 we grew interested in changing substituents at both the
naphthylamine and pyridinium units through synthesis. In the discovery
phase of our study, 2-amino-6-bromonaphthalene (see 1, Scheme 1) was an
ideal starting material because of the convenience of forging two
sp3 C–N bonds by routine alkylation.16 However, precursor 1 is expensive,
and in substitution events with certain electrophiles, such as those
with unprotected hydroxyl groups, reactions were found to produce
low yields or no isolable products. As an improvement, we report herein
a more practical and versatile approach to DANPY variants made possible
by an effort to expand the scope of the Bucherer synthesis of 2-aminonaphthalenes.

Scheme 1 Concise Three-Step Synthesis of Pyrrolidine Dye Variant 4 and Alternative Retrosynthetic Analysis
Results and Discussion
Our primary aim in preparing
modified DANPY’s was to increase water solubility and affinity
for hydrophilic biomolecules by incorporating hydrogen-bonding functions,
such as ether and alcohol groups (entries 6 and 12, Table 1). The addition of groups that
allow coating of DNA to yield an alcohol-soluble electro-optic material17,18 is also disclosed. Another pursuit still under development is building
amphiphilic dyes suitable for lipid staining (e.g., n-octyl chain, entry 3, Table 1). We have used a theory-aided design process in which properties
of dyes with groups of interest were first screened using density
functional theory (DFT) calculations in order to predict optimal geometries
and both hyperpolarizability (β) and charge-transfer absorbance
(λmax) values.

(Entries 6–12) or Lipophilic (Entries 2–5) DANPY Variants

c By Marvin/ChemAxon consensus
method.

Structures were optimized in chloroform solvent using
Gaussian 0919 at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d)
level of theory. Properties were calculated in chloroform at the same
level of theory, which has been determined20 to furnish good estimates on the relative β and λmax of chromophores and was effective for predicting the relative
optical properties of DANPY-1 and similar dyes.5 Octanol–water partition coefficient (log P) values, a common measure of hydrophobicity, were estimated
using the ChemAxon consensus logP method in MarvinSketch.21,22 Data from the computational screen is compiled in Table 1.

Shifting the absorbance
maximum or manipulating hyperpolarizability was not a major target
of this study; the primary rationale for calculating these properties
for derivatives of interest was to evaluate whether optical properties
would be comparable to DANPY-1.5 In general,
increasing the electron-donating strength of the donor–acceptor
compounds of Table 1 is expected to result in a bathochromic shift in the absorbance
spectrum and yield dyes with higher hyperpolarizabilities. In most
cases, the change in electron-donating power of the naphthylamine
moiety23 is minor, resulting in proportionately
small effects on λmax and hyperpolarizability. One
exception is the deactivated amide carbonyl-containing variant (entry
9), which has a much lower β and bluer absorption maximum. However,
changes in side-chain functionalization induce a significant and desirable
variation in hydrophobicity, ranging from a log P of 2.66 for entry 3 (similar to that of benzene22) to −1.82 for entry 11 (similar to free leucine).
The wide range of logP values suggests that the DANPY nucleus can
be tuned for affinity to either hydrophobic or hydrophilic substrates
with simple modifications to the naphthylamine substituents.

With modeling data supporting tunable hydrophobicity and little change
in hyperpolarizability or λmax across a selection
of N-alkyl groups, we set out to test a double SN2 strategy for preparing 2-amino-6-bromonaphthalenes. As illustrated
in Scheme 1, 2-pyrrolidino-6-bromo-naphthalene
(2) forms in 87% yield upon base-promoted N,N-dialkylation of 1 with 1,4-dichlorobutane
[tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 95
°C] under Finkelstein conditions. Subsequent Suzuki coupling
with pyridine 4-boronic acid under the previously optimized5 conditions [1 mol % Pd2(dba)3, 4 mol % SPhos,24 and 4:1 dimethylformamide
(DMF)–EtOH,25 90 °C] gives
intermediate 2-pyrrolidino-6-pyridyl-naphthalene (3,
not shown in Scheme 1) in >60% recrystallized yield on gram scale without chromatography.
In a third and final step, site-selective N-methylation
in warm acetonitrile gives dye 4 in 76% yield as thin
red needles after passage through a plug of silica gel in 10:1 dichloroethane–MeOH
and recrystallization from chloroform. Pyrrolidine derivative 4 has been characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and UV/vis spectroscopies in acetone and methanol, respectively. As
shown in Figure 2A,
there is a 12 nm red shift in its absorbance relative to DANPY-1 and
a negligible shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence. The
small bathochromic shift for 4 aligns with that predicted
from DFT calculations and is likely due to the greater electron-donating
power of pyrrolidine versus dimethylamine; the reduction of the Stokes
shift in a polar methanol environment is likely due to the increased
hydrophobicity (larger log P) of the ground state.
The photoluminescence quantum yield of 4 at 440 nm in DMSO is 0.053,
slightly larger than the 0.045 measured for DANPY-1 using identical
protocols4 and consistent with the smaller
Stokes shift. Comparable DNA affinity is demonstrated by simple gel
electrophoresis separation of a commercial 18 kb DNA ladder (Figure 2B). If 4 is added to a 0.8% agarose gel suspension in a prepour phase (1.0
μg/mL), excellent postrun visualization of the DNA components
can be observed by fluorescence at 450 nm excitation with a conventional
Bio-Rad GelDoc EZ Imager.

The path of synthesis depicted in Scheme 1 is highly scalable due to
the crystalline nature of 2, 3, and 4. However, precursor 1 is expensive ($18/g),
and delocalization in its conjugate base lowers its nucleophilicity,
giving way to a monomethylated26 byproduct
in the parent DANPY-1 synthesis that must be removed by column chromatography.
An alternative strategy for installing the dialkyl naphthalene amine
in 2 would be to construct its lone sp2 C–N bond by either Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling
or formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, other 2,6-difunctionalized
naphthalenes were considered for a direct amination (Scheme 1), and one that is advantageous
is 6-bromo-2-naphthol (5) because of lower cost ($2/g).
As shown in Table 2, we now report that tricycle 2 and five other 6-bromo-2-naphthalene-2-amines
(6–10) are readily obtained in a
practical manner by simply mixing naphthol 5 with a secondary
amine under Bucherer reaction conditions.

A Bucherer reaction27,28 involves thermal
conversion of a naphthol to a naphthylamine, and it has also seen
use for transamination events in the 2-aminonaphthalene series. The
transformation takes place in aqueous medium in the presence of sulfurous
acid or any of its salts (i.e., NaHSO3, Na2SO3, and Na2S2O5). French chemist
Robert Lepetit was the first to discover the transformation in 1898.28 Independently, the German chemist Hans Theodor
Bucherer recognized its industrial value and was the first to postulate
a reversible, equilibrium-based mechanism.29 The process requires temperatures beyond the boiling point of water
and is not applicable to benzene substrates because of a temporary
disruption in aromaticity. To our knowledge, the scope of the reaction
with respect to cyclic amines is underdeveloped, although some isolated
examples30−33 of amine condensation with a halogenated (deactivated) naphthol
are known. Another report describes aminonaphthalene synthesis by
use of microwave irradiation,34 but neutral
and electron-rich (methoxylated) naphthol substrates were explored,
and only acyclic secondary amines were tested as nucleophiles.

The amination procedure involves magnetic stirring of a mixture of
6-bromo-2-naphthol (5), five equivalents of the desired
secondary amine,35 and two equivalents
of sodium metabisulfite in water at 150 °C in sealed pressure
flasks (Table 2). Na2S2O5 (common name disodium, also called
sodium pyrosulfite or sodium disulfite) was chosen as the reagent
because once dissolved in water, metabisulfite dianion releases sulfur
dioxide as a pungent gas and leaves behind sulfite dianion, the most
reactive of sulfurous acid salts known to mediate Bucherer transformation.
For all entries in Table 2, the reported yields represent an average of at least two
runs conducted on gram scale in which reaction time was restricted
to 1 day out of convenience; some combinations of reagents may benefit
from prolonged heating. Additionally, in no cases are byproducts visible
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or 1H NMR analysis.
In the event where minor amounts of unreacted 5 are present
at workup given the reversible nature of the reaction, a simple flash
filtration through a pad of silica gel is sufficient to deliver amine
products in analytically pure form36 because
naphthol is considerably more polar.

Two other advantages concerning
the scope of this methodology are as follows: (1) success in the process
is not limited to secondary amines that are water-soluble. As shown
in entry 1b, the use of diisobutylamine as nucleophile gives modest
levels of conversion in just 24 h even though the reaction mixture
remains biphasic. (2) Direct preparation of compound 10 (entry 5) underscores a tolerance of the method to free alcohols.
It is probable that an alternative synthetic route to 10 based on iterative N-alkylation would be much longer
and require protecting group manipulations.

Based on known literature
precedents,27,28 formation of products 2 and 6–10 involves a key bisulfite
adduct derived from addition to the keto form of the starting naphthol
(see d, Scheme 2). To begin, protonation at C1 commences a typical enol–keto
tautomerization, yielding conjugated oxonium cation a. 1,4-Sulfite addition (→c), followed by another
tautomerization, is the dominant pathway to tetralone sulfonate d. It is also possible that C3 protonation gives b, with subsequent 1,6-sulfite addition (→c) and
enol–keto tautomerization acting as an alternative path to d. In either case, keto forms of 1- and 2-naphthols (a and b) are known28 to behave differently than their nonaromatic counterparts. Cyclic
and acyclic alkanones can only furnish 1,2-bisulfite adducts, which
are quite useful when conducting purification or isolation.37 Here, 1,2-addition (to either a or b) must be reversible, as the free carbonyl at C2
is required for further transformation to the amine. It is also unlikely
that a 1,2-adduct (derived from a) would later converge
with d by [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement because the
tetrahedral intermediate would need to be O– (vs S−)
bound.

Scheme 2 Mechanism for Amination is Based on a Rate-Limiting Genesis
of Tetralone Sulfonic Acid Adduct d
After rate-determining formation of the tetralone
sulfonate (d), the course of product formation is straightforward.
Amine condensation with the free carbonyl delivers iminium ion e and then enamine f after proton loss at C1.
The final stage involves rearomatization by sodium hydrogen sulfite
elimination. With a mechanism established, it becomes clear why overamination
of 5 does not occur under these reaction conditions:
C–N bond formation is restricted to the hydroxylated position
that serves as a latent carbonyl function.

As a salt, the DANPY
nucleus is subject to further diversification with respect to its
counterion and pyridinium alkyl group. The identity of the anion stems
from the choice of electrophile used to build the alkylpyridinium
cation, and primary bromides have also proven effective. As shown
in Scheme 3, N-alkylation of the pyridine derived from 6(5,36) with bromoalkanes linked to 7-hydroxy coumarin (umbelliferone)
give multifunctional fluorophores 12 and 13 as red, amorphous solids.38 A first step
in preparing these variants was to secure 1-bromoalkyl ethers of the
coumarin (11a,b) by Williamson reaction
with the corresponding 1,6- and 1,8-dibromoalkanes. These dye molecules
may be suitable for photonic devices that utilize DNA-derived polymer
waveguides.39 DANPY-15 was initially developed to be doped into such waveguides
as an electro-optic material.6,7,17,18 Prior attempts at such systems
required blending the DNA with a dye (such as Disperse Red 1), a cetyltrimethylammonium
surfactant, and in many cases a cross-linking agent for thermal stability.
As single entities, 12 and 13 are unique
in merging a cationic chromophore (that can act as a counterion for
DNA) with a cross-linkable coumarin surfactant that undergoes [2 +
2] cycloaddition in the presence of UV light.40 In future work, we hope to show that these molecules will coat the
surface of a DNA duplex, solubilize it, offer a reasonable density
of chromophores for EO activity, and can be photocross-linked to harden
the dye–biopolymer matrix.

Conclusions
In summary, a short and convergent entry
to DANPY dyes has been refined by extending the Bucherer amination
of 2-naphthols to cyclic secondary amines. The methodology relies
on a less expensive naphthalene precursor relative to earlier work
and will facilitate study of structure–function relationships
in the donor amine unit of the dye. The synthetic pathway also tolerates
modification within the acceptor pyridinium domain, with more elaborate
chromophores 12 and 13 now available for
DNA-based biophotonics. Additional results will be reported in due
course.

Experimental Section
All reactions were carried out
in oven- and flame-dried glassware under inert atmosphere in dry degassed
solvents using Schlenk and vacuum line techniques. Column chromatography
was performed with high-purity Davisil (grade 635) silica gel. TLC
was performed with 0.25 mm silica gel 60 F254 plates, and
spot visualization was accomplished by exposure to long- and short-wave
ultraviolet light. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform
IR spectrophotometer; peaks are reported in wavenumbers (cm–1) as strong (s), medium (m), weak (w), or broad (br). NMR spectra
were recorded on a 500 MHz instrument as part of a user consortium
created by California State University Channel Islands (Camarillo,
CA). 1H NMR chemical shifts are listed in ppm from tetramethylsilane
with the solvent resonance as the internal standard (CDCl3: δ 7.26; (CD3)2CO: δ 2.05; (CD3)2SO: δ 2.50) in the sequence: chemical shift,
multiplicity, coupling constants (Hz), and integration. 13C NMR spectra (125 MHz) were recorded (at CSUCI) with proton decoupling;
chemical shifts are given to the nearest tenth of a ppm with solvent
resonance as the internal standard (CDCl3: δ 77.16;
(CD3)2CO: δ 29.84, (CD3)2SO: δ 40.45). High-resolution mass spectra were recorded
using electrospray ionization time-of-flight methods at the University
of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign). Elemental analyses were conducted
at Robertson Microlit Labs (Ledgewood, NJ). UV/visible spectra were
recorded in methanol using a spectrophotometer in double-beam mode
with a pure solvent reference. Fluorescence spectra were recorded
in methanol using a fluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 450
nm and a grating width of 15 nm for both emission and excitation,
subtracting the scattering contribution from a pure methanol reference.

(Pd2(dba)3), 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl
(SPhos), pyridine 4-boronic acid, sodium meta-bisulfite, petroleum
ether, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, 1,2-dichloroethane,
acetic acid, methanol, toluene, heptane, and chloroform were purchased
commercially and used as received. DMF and DMSO were passed through
a short pad of alumina and vacuum distilled over calcium hydride.
Ethanol was distilled over calcium hydride and stored over 3 Å
MS. Anhydrous acetonitrile was dispensed from a solvent purification
system driven by compressed argon. 1,4-Dichlorobutane was distilled
over calcium sulfate. Iodomethane, 1,6-dibromohexane, 1,8-dibromooctane,
and all secondary amines were distilled to colorless oils in the absence
of a drying agent and used immediately.

1-(6-Bromo-2-naphthyl)pyrrolidine (2) by N,N-Dialkylation Conditions
1,4-Dichlorobutane
(1.63 mL, 14.9 mmol, 3.0 equiv) was added to a suspension of TBAI
(11.0 g, 29.8 mmol, 6.0 equiv) and potassium carbonate (1.37 g, 9.94
mmol, 2.0 equiv) in DMSO (30 mL, 0.125 M). The mixture was submerged
in an oil bath heated to 95 °C, stirring was continued, and 2-amino-6-bromo-naphthalene
(1, 1.10 g, 4.47 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added slowly by
a syringe pump as a solution in 10 mL of DMSO at a rate of 0.1 mL
per minute. After 20 h of stirring at 95 °C, the mixture was
diluted with ethyl acetate (40 mL) and water (40 mL) and moved to
a separatory funnel. The organic layer was removed and the aqueous
layer was washed twice with ethyl acetate (20 mL). The combined organic
layers were washed three times with saturated sodium chloride to remove
residual water and DMSO. The resulting solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. During
this step, iridescent brown salt crystals were observed to precipitate
out of solution. This substance proved to be TBAI and, if desired,
could be removed with an additional filtration step. It is not necessary,
however, because the salt does not migrate through the silica gel
used for purification. Concentration afforded a shiny, light brown
solid. Column chromatography in 30:1 hexane:ethyl acetate (TLC Rf = 0.47) provided 1.08 g (3.91
mmol, 87%) of a pale yellow solid that can be recrystallized from
hot ethanol. Melting point = 168–169 °C. IR (KBr pellet):

4-(6-(Pyrrolidin-1-yl)naphthalene-2-yl)pyridine (3)
A heavy-walled glass pressure vessel equipped with a magnetic
stir bar and a threaded Teflon/O-ring seal was charged with 1-(6-bromo-2-naphthyl)pyrrolidine
(2, 1.03 g, 3.73 mmol), pyridine 4-boronic acid (688
mg, 5.60 mmol, 1.5 equiv), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)
(51.1 mg, 0.0558 mmol, 0.015 equiv), SPhos (91.6 mg, 0.223 mmol, 0.06
equiv), and sodium carbonate (789 mg, 7.44 mmol, 2.0 equiv). The vessel
was fitted with a rubber septum and a vent needle, evacuated, and
purged with argon on the Schlenk line. Anhydrous DMF (60 mL) and ethanol
(15 mL) were introduced by a syringe under a positive pressure of
argon (4:1 DMF–EtOH, 0.05 M). Some solid reaction contents
dissolved, but homogeneity was not achieved at 23 °C; a turbid
light green suspension was observed. After removing the septum and
sealing the reactor, the mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 h at
85 °C (oil bath). At this point, the reaction mixture was less
turbid and a Pd black precipitate was visible. A routine TLC analysis
confirmed the absence of the starting bromoarene (2).
The mixture was cooled to room temperature, transferred to a separatory
funnel, and diluted with water (75 mL) and ethyl acetate (75 mL).
After removing the organic layer, the aqueous layer was washed two
times with 50 mL of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic layers
were washed three times with an equal volume of saturated sodium chloride
in order to remove residual DMF. The purified extract was dried over
MgSO4, filtered through a medium porosity glass frit, and
concentrated by rotary evaporation to give an orange solid residue.
The crude material can be purified by recrystallization from hot toluene.
In the event, ∼1.5 g of the solid residue dissolved readily
in 40–45 mL of boiling toluene but required a hot filtration
to remove traces of insoluble deposits. Slow cooling of the hot filtrate
delivered the product as light orange, flaky nodules and clusters.
After leaving the flask at −20 °C overnight, crystals
of 3 were isolated in >60% yield as a single crop
by filtration, washing with small portions of cold petroleum ether,
and drying under high vacuum. Alternatively, the crude material is
absorbed onto silica gel and filtered through a short column in 1:1:1
petroleum ether:ethyl acetate:dichloromethane (the latter additive
prevents “streaking” of the diamine, TLC Rf = 0.35). Rotary evaporation of the
long-wave UV-active fractions results in spontaneous deposition of
light orange crystals that were vacuum-filtered, washed with cold
petroleum ether, and dried under high vacuum (0.98 g, 96% yield).
Either mode of purification serves to remove uncharacterized nonpolar
impurities (Rf > 0.5)
and 4,4′-bipyridine (Rf = 0.15) derived from the homocoupling of pyridine 4-boronic
acid. Melting point = 221–222 °C. IR (KBr pellet): 2976

1-Methyl-4-(6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)naphthalen-2-yl)pyridinium Iodide
(4)
In a dry glass vial containing a magnetic
stir bar and a Teflon-lined screw cap, 140.0 mg of 4-(6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)naphthalene-2-yl)pyridine
(3, 0.510 mmol) was dissolved in 5.1 mL of acetonitrile
(0.10 M) under argon. To the resulting light orange solution, iodomethane
(48.0 μL, 0.771 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added by a microsyringe.
The vial was capped and submerged in an oil bath heated to 60 °C.
After 10 min, the reaction mixture was more orange in color and gentle
solvent reflux had begun. Upon 24 h of stirring at this temperature,
a bright red solution and dark precipitate were observed. The solid
is the pyridinium iodide, which can be recovered by microfiltration
but in variable purity because of a potential for dimethylation to
give a dicationic material. Typically, the mixture was cooled to room
temperature and homogenized using a minimal volume of commercial chloroform
(which contains 1–2% ethanol). Glacial acetic acid (32 μL,
1.1 equiv) was also added to ensure an acidic pH and promote dissolution.
The solution was then saturated with silica gel, dry-packed onto the
absorbent, and passed through a broad but short plug of silica (3
cm wide x 3 cm long) with 88:9:3 dichloroethane:methanol:acetic acid
as an eluant (TLC Rf =
0.30). An uncharacterized yellow-orange fraction elutes just before
the desired product, which is bright red in solution and light blue
to violet under long-wave UV irradiation. The column also removes
a dicationic impurity, as the dimethylamine unit can also quaternize
by methylation. Pooling and rinsing of pure fractions with chloroform,
followed by concentration on a rotovap connected to a high vacuum,
gave a dark red, tacky residue. Prolonged exposure to high vacuum
may be required to remove the less volatile acetic acid. The solid
was then recrystallized from a boiling mixture of chloroform (25 mL)
and methanol (2–4 mL, just enough to promote dissolution) using
a hot filtration step to remove any insoluble material. Upon slow
cooling to 23 °C and further chilling to −20 °C overnight,
the dye deposited as thin, bright red needles that were collected
on a fine porosity glass frit, washed twice with petroleum ether,
and dried under high vacuum. By this method, 161 mg (76% yield) of
product 4 was recovered in a single crop. Melting point

6-Bromo-N,N-dimethylnaphthalene-2-amine
(6) by Representative Bucherer Conditions
A
heavy glass-walled “Chemglass” pressure reactor equipped
with a threaded Teflon/O-ring closure and a magnetic stir bar was
charged directly with 4.09 g of 6-bromo-2-naphthol (5, 18.3 mmol) and 6.96 g (36.6 mmol, 2.0 equiv) of sodium metabisulfite
as solids. Water (18 mL, 1.0 M) was then added, dissolving the base
but not the starting material. Up to 5.0 equiv35 of secondary amine (in this case, 16.5 mL of a 25% solution
of dimethylamine in water, 91.5 mmol) was added by a syringe and the
resulting cloudy suspension was stirred vigorously for 24 h in an
oil bath heated to 150 °C. Melting of the substrate leads to
partial dissolution, and the heterogeneous mixture gradually turns
dark brown in color. After cooling to room temperature and venting
the flask, the reaction mixture was extracted three times with 50
mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed
once with an equal volume of saturated sodium bicarbonate and sodium
chloride and dried over MgSO4. Filtration to remove the
drying agent and concentration by rotary evaporation gave a light
yellow residue that can be passed through a pad of silica gel in 10:1
hexane:Et2O (to remove any trace of 5 present
by TLC analysis) or directly recrystallized from hexane to give a

7-(6-Bromohexyloxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (11a)
7-Hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone) can be recrystallized
from ethanol (if desired) as light yellow, flaky nodules. A 50 mL
round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar was charged with
umbelliferone (1.50 g, 9.25 mmol), potassium carbonate (3.84 g, 27.8
mmol, 3.0 equiv), and dry acetone (18.5 mL, 0.5 M). These solids partially
dissolved, forming a light yellow suspension that was treated with
1,6-dibromohexane (11.0 mL, 71.5 mmol, 7.7 equiv) using a syringe.
A large excess of electrophile is used in order to discourage dietherification
by the phenoxide anion. After 48 h of stirring at 23 °C, TLC
analysis of the reaction mixture revealed only trace amounts of the
remaining starting material. Thus, a stream of nitrogen was used to
purge out over half of the solvent volume, and the mixture was partitioned
between 50 mL of water and 50 mL of 1:1 ethyl acetate:hexanes in a
separatory funnel. The organic layer was collected and the bright
yellow aqueous layer was washed twice with 30 mL of 1:1 ethyl acetate:hexanes.
The pooled organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated.
Purification by silica gel chromatography with 2.5:1 petroleum ether:ethyl
acetate as an eluant (Rf = 0.35) delivered 1.876 g (62% yield) of product as an off-white

4-(6-Dimethylamino)naphthalene-2-yl)-1-(8-(2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yloxy)hexyl) Pyridinium Bromide (12)
A flame-dried 25 mL round-bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar was
charged with 153 mg (0.470 mmol, 1.0 equiv) of 7-(6-bromohexyloxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (11a) and 117 mg (0.471 mmol,
1.0 equiv) of N,N-dimethyl-6-(pyridine-4-yl)-naphthalene-2-amine5 as solids. After evacuating and back-filling
the flask with argon on a vacuum line, its contents were dissolved
in 4.7 mL of acetonitrile (0.10 M). The flask was equipped with a
water condenser and submerged in an oil bath heated to 75 °C.
After 30 min of stirring, the initial light yellow solution had given
way to an orange solution and a gentle reflux of solvent had begun.
Upon 40 h of stirring at reflux, the reaction mixture was bright red.
The mixture was cooled to 23 °C and homogenized with ∼1.0
mL of chloroform (containing 1–2% ethanol). The solution was
then saturated with silica gel, dry-packed onto the absorbent, and
passed through a broad but short plug of silica gel (3 cm wide ×
3 cm long) with 88:9:3 dichloromethane:methanol:acetic acid as an
eluant (Rf = 0.50). Concentration
of the dark red, long-wave UV-active fractions, first on a rotovap
and then under high vacuum, gave 250 mg (93%) of 12 as
a crusty, bright red solid. Melting point = 90–95 °C.

2-Morpholino-6-bromonaphthalene can be synthesized
by analogy to 2 with 2-chloroethyl ether as the electrophile
and a longer reaction time (3 d). Similarly, the N-acetyl and N-octyl precursors to dye entries 3
and 9 of Table 1 are
accessible by alkylation and acylation of 2-methylamino-6-bromonaphthalene,
a structure we have reported previously (see ref (5)).

Reactions can be performed with fewer equivalents of the secondary
amine, but in our hands longer heating times were needed to match
the same levels of conversion and product yields. A 5:1 stoichiometry
and 1 day reaction time was chosen out of convenience, since all amines
tested are commercially available. Individual reaction optimization
may be appropriate for more expensive dissymmetric or synthetically
obtained N nucleophiles.


Dye molecule 4 was synthesized from 2 obtained
by N,N-dialkylation (Scheme 1), whereas dyes 12 and 13 derive from 6 obtained by the Bucherer
reaction. It is noteworthy that either means of preparing structures 2 and 6 gives crystalline material that shows
no melting point depression when purified samples made from the different
reagent systems are pre-mixed.

NMR spectra for compounds 12 and 13 are only partially resolved due to
the potential for multiple conformations in solution and intermolecular
π stacking. 1H NMR chemical shifts tabulated in the Experimental Section correspond to the dominant
or major conformer.
