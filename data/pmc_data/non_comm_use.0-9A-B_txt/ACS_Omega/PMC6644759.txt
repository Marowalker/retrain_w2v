The interaction or
nonbonded energies of base organic ions and
water molecules during the flotation process of minerals have important
meanings for organizing hydrophobic and stable collectors. Furthermore,
the interaction, cross-term, and valence energies of optimized structures
are important for understanding the properties and structures of selective
collectors. The simulation of pure scheelite mineral (PSM) surfaces
with four different negative ions, using an adsorption locator module
is demonstrated. The interaction energies for base organic ions and
water molecules were resolved and detected by shaping the best hydrophobic
interaction and the most stable suspension over the PSM surface (112)
and (101). The adsorption locator results for base organic ions and
water molecules on PSM surfaces (112) and (101) using buffer width
0.5 Å and temperature range from 318.15 to 283.15 K confirmed
the results obtain from Forcite calculations. The results have demonstrated
that the possibilities of using consistent valence force field implemented
by Forcite and adsorption locator modules in the selection of flotation
reagents are cost saving. Furthermore, hydrophobicity of the main
negative ions in soaps were solved by the simulation methods and results
are in a good agreement with the experimental methods that proved
that mustard soap is more selective on the mineral surfaces than sunflower
soap when used as a collector. Increasing the molecular weight of
negative ions increases the interaction energy between base collector
ions and PSM surfaces (112) and (101) significantly.

1 Introduction
Most
of the multiscale techniques and art molecular are described
in detail before.1 Furthermore, simulation
study was applied to search the interaction energies of a selection
of organic surfactant molecules with the scheelite and calcium fluoride
surfaces. The desired effect of the surfactant molecules was thus
computed for the scheelite to be carboxylic acids (CAs) > alkyl
hydroxamates
(AHs) > hydroxy aldehydes (HAs) > alkyl amines (AAs) and for
fluoride
AHs > CAs > HAs > AAs.2 The energies
of
interaction thus computed are used as a testing tool to discover the
most selective reagent for an established surface.2−4 Also, another
study demonstrated that universal force field (UFF) with Mulliken
charges can be employed to simulate the interaction with interfacial
water accurately than using UFF with equilibration charges and results
indicated that sulfide mineral surfaces have natural hydrophobic character
but sphalerite surface (101) and molybdenite have weakly hydrophobic
characters.5 Studies involving the adsorption
behavior of reagents at talc,6−8 molybdenite,9 and coal,10−12 surfaces have shown the significance of hydrophobic
interactions in adsorption processes. This study used a consistent
valence force field (CVFF) to obtain logistic comparisons for four
base collectors after interaction with pure scheelite surfaces (112)
and (101). The CVFF has been successfully applied for silica–organic
interface before.13,14 CVFF includes nonbonded parameters
(the Born model) for extra force field types that are helpful for
simulations of minerals, such as alumina phosphates, silicates, alumina
silicates, and clays. These contributing parameters were gained by
employing the Ewald summation for nonbonded interactions between the
extra atom types.15 CVFF was suited to
small organic molecules (such as amides, carboxylic acids, etc.) and
gas phase structures. CVFF covers proteins, peptides, and a very large
range of organic systems. CVFF has been applied in a widespread way
for many years. CVFF is mainly proposed for analyses of structures
and binding energies. Furthermore, CVFF can predict energies of conformational
and vibrational frequencies fairly well.15 The performance of CVFF is good for metals, minerals, and polymers.1,16−18 CVFF accomplishes more upper accuracy by cross-terms
to report for such factors as angle distortions or bonds made near
atoms. Dynamic properties of molecules and their experimental vibration
frequencies were reported accurately by these terms. It can consist
of the following: stretch–stretch, stretch–bend–stretch, bend–bend, torsion–stretch, torsion–bend–bend,
bend–torsion–bend, and stretch–torsion–stretch.19 CVFF earned full inclusion of Coulomb and Lennard-Jones
interactions.20 Recently, accurate parameters
for inorganic compounds have been inserted in the interface force
field (IFF).21−23 The augmented IFF permits examining a very large
indefinite number of new bioorganic interfaces with metals and minerals.1 IFF achieved power to describe experimental vibration
of graphite accurately in the calculation of surface energy, hydration
energy, and contact angle, more than CVFF, polymer consistent force
field, chemistry at Harvard using molecular mechanics (CHARMM), and
CHARMM new fit because it was supported by virtual electrons to account
for cation−π, π–π stacking, H−π
bonds, and solvent and organic interactions.20

2 Forcite and Adsorption Locator Modules
The
comparatively new module in Materials Studio is the adsorption
locator, and it has been employed in several studies to find out binding sites
and look into their energies, such as organic molecules on the surfaces
of metal and nanoparticles.24 Adsorption
locator is a simulation module that involves the greatest success
of the Monte Carlo (MC) method in statistical mechanics25 in some generalized points such as the simulated
annealing optimization method where an unreal temperature is applied
and gradually decreased.19 An adsorbate
loaded with a substrate or an adsorbate mixture of a fixed composition
can be simulated by the adsorption locator, which helps us to discover
low-energy adsorption sites on nonperiodic and periodic substrates
and also to analyze the preferential adsorption of mixtures of adsorbate
elements.25 Forcite is an advanced tool
of the classical molecular mechanics (MM) method that gives quick
energy computations and trustable optimized geometry of molecules
and periodic system.26 A force field refers
to any potential vibrations of a definite molecule in terms of some
chosen set of internal coordinates.27 The
MC method relies on statistical mechanics rather than molecular dynamics;
instead of seeking to reproduce the dynamics of a system, it generates
states according to appropriate Boltzmann probabilities.19 The MM method using classical physics relies
on the force field with embedded parameters derived from the experiment
and observation rather than theory.19 The
energy results given by the adsorption locator were accurate for the
comparison between base collector ions because the energy and minimization
settings in the two modules were the same. This involves the CVFF,
nonbonded summation methods, atomic charges, quality of the energy,
geometry optimization calculations, and the convergence tolerances
applied for the minimization.15 It was
indicated that combination principles for nonbonded parameters between
the inorganic and organic compounds accomplish well so that no extra
parameters are required to simulate interfacial interactions.22,28−36 The bonding of hydrogen, which happens amongst the OH groups in
organic molecules and the sites of hydrogen bonding on the surfaces
of minerals, is the major reason for adsorption, as proposed by other
researchers.37,38

2.1 Significance
of Molecular Modeling
Mineral flotation is a promising modern
area of molecular modeling,
where the collector adsorbs onto water–mineral interfaces to
control their hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties.39 The prediction of the structural features requires new
and effective surfactants that could be accomplished by molecular
modeling.40 It supplies detailed information
and important understanding on subjects such as the potential of mineral
surfaces, molecule adsorption, and floatability of the mineral.22,41−45 In this article, a combination of MM and MC has been studied to
generate logistic prediction for the behavior of different base solvents
during flotation on the basis of interaction energy. Figure 1 summarizes the simulation
steps used in this study.

Figure 1 Demonstration of simulation steps used in Material
Studio to predict
the most hydrophobic base collector during flotation.

The steps described in Figure 1 are accurate to generate logistic prediction
for the
interaction energy between negative ions of base collectors and pure
scheelite mineral (PSM) surfaces during flotation. Because all energy
minimization parameters and mineral surfaces 112 or 101 were fixed
constant except solvents in water, which were changed for each module,
the total number of modules was eight because the study considered
two PSM surfaces and four different base reagents. The results obtained
are helpful in qualitative analysis for the comparison between interaction
energy of base solvents during flotation to predict the most selective
base collector.

2.2 Liquid–Solid Nonbonded
Energy
In this article, simulations have adopted a new methodology
to demonstrate
how MC and MM calculations available in Material Studio Version 8
could be fully applied for prediction of highly hydrophobic base reagent
during flotation. Applying simulation to calculate interaction energy
or nonbonded energy of the liquid–solid interfaces of various
types of base collectors while fixing other parameters constant is
not a difficult task. And simulation-generated accurate logistic prediction
helps us in the qualitative analysis of nonbonded energy. Furthermore,
using the experimental method such as single pure mineral flotation
where mustard and sunflower soaps were variables and all other parameters
were kept constant to determine the best flotation performance by
calculating recovery and analyzing concentrates using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) technique is very significant. Thus, XPS technique
is an excellent experimental indicator for determining selectivity
and hydrophobicity of the collector. Therefore, this study was intended
to validate simulation results by XPS results.

3 Traditional and New Collectors
Nowadays, the prediction
and design of highly hydrophobic reagents
for flotation of scheelite represent a difficult problem in the industry.
Excellent effect of mustard soap on the pure scheelite mineral surface
(PSM)46 was observed through a trial-and-error
method, after trying sunflower and bean nut soaps as collectors. The
main compounds in mustard soap are erucate and 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate.46 It was made from natural materials and was inexpensive
because mustard oil is cheap.47 It can
be used as a collector, depressant, and froth for the mineral processing.48 It is not impossible to synthesize many kinds
of soaps from different oils, which have long-chain fatty acids (FAs),
aromatic compounds, and functional groups and test each soap on the
pure mineral surface as a collector to confirm which collector has
better flotation efficiency. Molecular modeling can solve failures
of a trial-and-error method to obtain a selective collector with low
costs and save time by simulating industrial additives to obtain a
selective reagent for the specific needs. Hydrophobic effect after
the collector adsorption on the surface of mineral can be detected
by experimental measurements, such as ζ-potential, flotation,
XPS, Fourier transform infrared,46 and
contact angle measurements. Screening and design of collectors developed
for flotation of scheelite must take into consideration the different
properties of mineral surfaces, such as a usually exposed cleavage
and its stability, characteristics of calcium (Ca) sites, or energies
of interaction between collectors and mineral surfaces.49−52 The most commonly exposed surfaces of scheelite particles are (112),
(101), and (001),49,53 whereas the PSM surfaces at 112
and 101 exhibit different characteristics corresponding to past works,
such as the investigation of sodium oleate gets the most effective
adsorption on the surface 112, followed by surface 101.54 Additives of organic effect on crystal
development processes proposed that collectors having two functional
groups could either affect the morphology of surfaces or limit the
development, whereas no particular effect was detected with collectors
having a single functional group.55−58 In addition, studies in this
domain intend to simulate ercuate ions,46 oleate ions,59 and 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate
(4-A-2-HB)46 on the PSM surfaces (112)
and (101). Because they were used in the recent years for the scheelite
flotation, few researchers reported on the factors that determine
the performance of combined reagents of aromatic compounds and carboxylate
ions of the long chain as a collector. These findings were helpful
for improving the scheelite separation.46,60−63

This article aimed to predict and understand the relationships
of the behavior and properties of the two main compounds of mustard
soap and different base organic ions and water molecules by employing
CVFF. Furthermore, it also investigates the inside CVFF and MC to
calculate interaction energies between atoms within each base’s
organic ions and on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101) in the existence
of water and base organic ions at logistic value, lower cost, and
less time, since it is still not easy to reveal the interaction details
by experimental measurements alone.64 The
interaction, intramolecular and adsorption energies of each base organic
and water molecules have been averaged for the PSM surfaces (112)
and (101), after using the MC calculations. Furthermore, a small water
molecule after optimization, has been used for validation of experimental
results, as demonstrated by Syouki.65 There
is no research work done yet in this domain that investigates electronic
structures of the two principal compounds of the mustard soap and
main compound in the sunflower soap, on the PSM surfaces (112) and
(101), using Forcite and adsorption locator modules.

Terms from 1 to 4 have been
commonly referred to as the diagonal
terms for the valence force field and represent the energy of deformation
of bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles, and inversion or out-of-plane
interactions, respectively. Inversion energy is the energy needed
to transform a molecule from one spatial form to another. It gives
a good indication of the nature of the bonding between the atoms within
a molecule.66 Terms 5 and 6 are commonly
referred to as the diagonal terms for the nonbonded force field and
represent the energy of interactions between the atoms within a molecule.
Terms from 7 to 10 are off-diagonal (or cross) terms and represent
couplings between deformations of internal coordinates. For example,
term 5 describes the coupling between stretching of adjacent bonds.
These terms are required to accurately reproduce experimental vibration
frequencies and therefore the dynamic properties of molecules. In
some cases, research has also shown them to be important in accounting
for structural deformations. However, cross-terms can become unstable
when the structure is far from a minimum.15 Comparison between energies of optimized structures of base organic
ions after geometry optimization was performed; this shows that the
base organic ions had two or more functional groups and the interaction
energy between their atoms is low as in the 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate
and mixture of erucate-4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate molecules. MM calculations
have indicated that the mixtures of erucate with aromatic compound
will be more hydrophobic on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101) than
other molecules because it gave high valence and cross-term energies
and lower potential and interaction energies due to the presence of
carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, aromatic, and hydrocarbon groups.

In Table 3, the
elemental analyses of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen are the most likely
point of attachments between collector and PSM surfaces. The lower
formal charge and higher molecular weight were −2 and 489.69,
respectively, as found in the mixtures of erucate and 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate.

simulation study that studies a similar structure of PSM sample using
the adsorption locator module. The structure consists of blue, red,
and yellow atoms, which represented the W, Ca, and O, respectively
in the PSM. The structure of PSM is shown in Figures 3 and 4.

4.3 Monte-Carlo
Simulation of PSM Surfaces (112)
and (101) with Base Organic Ions and Water Molecules
Outputs
calculated by the Monte-Carlo simulation for adsorption of different
organic and water molecules on PSM surface (112) and (101) are shown
in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.
The data within the Table S1 have included
total energy in kcal/mol of the base organic ions and water molecules
on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101). The total amount of the energies
of the organic and water molecules (the energy of rigid adsorption
and the energy of deformation) have been characterized as the total
energy. In addition, energy of adsorption in kcal/mol described energy
released or needed when the relaxed base organic ions and water constituents
adsorbed on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101). Energy of adsorption
has been determined from the sum of the rigid adsorption energy and
the deformation energy for the base organic ions and water molecules.
Energy of rigid adsorption describes the energy, in kcal/mol, released
or needed when the unrelaxed base organic ions and water constituents
before the geometry optimization step were adsorbed on the PSM surfaces
(112) and (101). The deformation energy reports the energy in kcal/mol,
released when the adsorbed base organic ions and water components
relaxed on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101). Table S1 also shows dEads/dNi, which reports the energy in kcal/mol of each base organic
ion and water molecule on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101). Regarding
the base collectors, the results presented in Tables S1 and S2 can justify the statement that mixtures of
erucate and aromatic compounds are better than other molecules because
increment of adsorption energy from each state to another state was
in good agreement with the interaction energy, in addition to the
fact that energies of interaction thus computed are used as a testing
tool to discover the most selective reagent for an established surface.2−4 During hydrophobic interaction of base collector on the surface
of PSM, adsorption locator module was a useful tool to find the most
stable base organic ion conformation on adsorption sites (112) and
(101) for PSM. This information helped to gain further insight about
microflotation tests using base collectors, such as the most likely
base collector on PSM surfaces (112) and (101) for the flotation system.
The results indicated that the base organic ions and water molecules
could adsorb onto PSM surfaces (112) and (101) using the adsorption,
interaction, and intramolecular energies to coat the crystalline of
PSM surfaces (112) and (101), which greatly helped the flotation of
the crystalline of PSM. In Figure 4a–d, cross-hair function supplied by Material
studio software was used to determine the values of energy at the
final step of the Monte Carlo method. Interaction energy was calculated
in each system and averaged for PSM surfaces (112) and (101). Adsorption
locator tool can be successfully employed to compute the interaction
energies at the final step of the Monte Carlo method to compare between
base collectors. Computed interaction energies are the nonbonded energies
between the atoms of the surfactant and the calcium ions of PSM surfaces
(112) and (101), in the presence of water molecules. The hydrophobic
interaction referred to the interaction between atoms of hydrophobic
tail of the base collector and calcium ions on the PSM surfaces (112)
and (101) in the presence of water molecules, as found in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. A higher
average value of interaction energy indicates the best hydrophobic
interaction;3 see Figure 5a. The mixture from erucate and 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate
was synthesized at the nanometer scale to compare its interaction
energy on the PSM surfaces with that of other solvents at the nanometer
scale and with experimental results. Therefore, mixtures containing
erucate, hydroxyl, amino, and aromatic groups are more selective in
coating the calcium ions of the PSM surfaces (112) and (101) than
erucate > oleate > 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate because it contains
carboxyl,
hydroxyl, amino, aromatic, and hydrocarbon groups, which were in agreement
with the findings from the literature reviews where excellent flotation
performances had a good contribution in the field of mineral processing.46,60−63 The calculated energy type and interaction energy were tabulated
for each system at the final step of the Monte Carlo method (2.5 ×
105); also, minimum adsorption energy in each study table
was reported (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 (a–d) Hydrophobic interaction of base organic ions and water
molecules on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101).

Hydrophobic interactions of base organic ions and water molecules
on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101) are shown in Figure 5a–d.

The term
hydrophobic was mentioned considering water molecules
during the liquid–solid interfaces of each structure because
the carboxylate ions had hydrophilic polar and hydrophobic nonpolar
parts.70 Also, the aromatic compound had
hydrophilic polar and hydrophobic nonpolar parts. During interactions,
the effective part is the hydrophobic part. During the Monte Carlo
rotation and translation steps, molecules containing erucate (C22)
or mixtures of erucate and aromatic compounds have low mobility over
the PSM surface (112) due to high interaction energy between negative
ions of molecule and calcium ions through the PSM surfaces (112) and
(101), whereas molecules containing oleate (C18) or aromatic compounds
have high mobility over the PSM surface (112) and (101) due to low
interaction energies; see Table S3 in the
Supporting Information and Figure 5a in this article. During isosteric heating, water
molecule energy was low but in the step sizes, its degree of rotation
was high, if compared with another base organic ions. Increasing the
molecular weight of negative ions in Table 3 increases the interaction energy between
base collector ions and PSM surfaces (112) and (101) significantly,
as shown in Figure 6a. In Figure 6a–c,
the interaction, intramolecular, and adsorption energies for A or
B or C or D base organic ions were increased or decreased according
to the increasing or decreasing of molecular weight of base collector,
respectively. Thus, simulated mustard soap ions (A) have higher adsorption,
intermolecular, and interaction energies, whereas 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate
ions (D) have lower adsorption, intermolecular, and interaction energies.
Therefore, two main ions of mustard soap are better than other base
collector ions simulated, which include main ions of sunflower soap
(oleate ions, C18). In the Figure 6a,c, K and M symbolize
two engineering units (K = 103 and M = 106).

Figure 6 (a–c) Average energies of hydrophobic
reagents on the PSM
surfaces (112) and (101).

Because of the liquid–solid interactions, using base
organic
ions and water molecules on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101) leads
to deformations of some of the bond lengths into the framework. These
models are not presented here. However, their adsorption density fields
are shown in Figure S1. For adsorption
density profiles of base organic ions and water molecules on the PSM
surfaces (112) and (101), see Figures 7 and 8. Results show that the
adsorption energy of oleate or erucate ions on the PSM surface 112
is more than that on the PSM surface (101), whereas the adsorption
energy of 4-A-2-HB or erucate-4-A-2-HB ions on PSM surface (101) is
more than that on the PSM surface (112). This is due to differences
in the interaction energies during interfaces between the PSM surfaces
and the oleate or erucate or 4-A-2-HB or erucate-4-A-2-HB ions.

4.4 Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry
(GC–MS) Analysis Results
To analyze fatty acids in
the sunflower soap, procedures from ref (30) have been employed, and the results demonstrated
that retention time of 6.046 min was introduced from the contamination
of the samples or from the GC–MS device. However, the quality
of the results was not affected. The GC–MS results are illustrated
in the Table 4 and Figure 9. These results showed
that the main carboxylate ions in the sunflower soap are 9-octadecenoate
ions (oleate ions).

4.5 XPS Analysis Results
To study the
relationship between atomic concentrations on the surfaces of pure
minerals after addition of soaps and simulated interaction energy
during flotation of main ions in soaps, flotation concentrates were
analyzed under similar test conditions for two samples at pH 11.3.
Then, two flotation concentrates were filtered, dried, and analyzed
using XPS technique. Then, XPS analysis results of two flotation concentrates
using Casa XPS software version 2.3.17PR.1.1 was provided to calculate
atomic concentration (%) on the surface of PSM. Figures 8, 9, and 10 showed that C 1s occupied 80.96, 62.79, and 32.22%
on the surface of PSM after the addition of mustard and sunflower
soaps and before addition of soaps, respectively, which revealed that
negative ions of soaps adsorbed onto mineral surfaces. The addition
of sunflower soap increased the amount of C 1s to 48.69%, whereas
the addition of ions of mustard soap increased the amount of C 1s
to 60.2% because the PSM has C 1s occupied 32.22%, which came from
nature on mineral surfaces. High atomic concentration on the surface
means the interaction energy between hydrophobic parts and calcium
ions on the surface of PSM were high, as shown in Table 5.

Relation between simulated interaction energy and atomic concentration
on the surfaces of PSM during flotation when using mustard and sunflower
soaps as collectors gave the liner equation (y =
1.701x – 74.926) with R2 = 1; see Figure 10. This indicated that recognition of hydrophobicity of the
main negative ions in soaps by the simulation methods mentioned in
this article are in good agreement with experimental results, which
proved that mustard soap is more selective on the mineral surfaces
than sunflower soap in use as a collector.

5 Conclusions
Molecule mechanics and Monte Carlo calculations were carried out
to study the interaction of PSM surfaces (112) and (101) with four
different ions. The predicted valence, nonbonded, and cross-term energies
for each base organic ion were determined by carrying out MM tools
in Forcite module using CVFF force field, followed by Monte Carlo
calculations of the configuration space within the substrate–adsorbate
system using CVFF force field. Interaction energy calculation shows
that between the four base organic ions studied, the best hydrophobic
molecules on the PSM surfaces (112) and (101) were mixtures, which
contain erucate and aromatic compound compared with erucate > oleate
> 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoate. Furthermore, simulation results showed
that oleate or erucate ions prefer to adsorb on the PSM surface (112)
more than on the PSM surface (101), whereas 4-A-2-HB or erucate-4-A-2-HB
ions prefer to adsorb on the PSM surface (101) more than on the PSM
surface (112).

MM calculations indicated the hydrophobic phenomenon
for the mixture
of erucate and aromatic compound in terms of the ownership in the
highest valence and cross-term energies and low interaction energies;
however, results of final steps of MC have proven that the best hydrophobic
interaction of liquid–solid interfaces occurs over the most
stable suspension containing negative ions of low mobility due to
high interaction energy. In methods described in refs (1) or (21) to obtain chemically and
thermodynamically consistent force field parameters for new compounds
using the IFF, it is required to calculate interaction energy by the
experimental methods in ref (71). This task will be in the future, and it will not affect
the qualitative results obtained in this article because the main
purpose of this article was the prediction of the best hydrophobic
base collector during flotation on the basis of nonbonded energy.

6 Materials and Methods
6.1 Pure Scheelite and Its
Surfaces (112) and
(101)
Scheelite was purchased from Jutong Co. Jiangxi Province,
China. Each sample was crushed and ground to fine particles employing
a laboratory disk mill (Wuhan Rock Crush and Grand Equipment Manufacture
CO., Ltd.). The purity of scheelite was 97.36%. The coordinates of
atoms within the unit cell of the scheelite have been investigated
from the experimental structural reports based on X-ray studies.67−69 Cells of the periodic surface were established from the unit cells
of the scheelite crystal at their cleavage plane.

6.2 Reagents
Mustard soap72 and
sunflower soap were synthesized by the same
method described in ref (72). After different electronic structures were obtained, mixture
from erucate and 4-amino-2-hydrobromate have been synthesized at the
nanometer scale (see Table 3 in the results) to represent the two main compounds in the
mustard soap, whereas the main compound in the sunflower soap is oleate
ions, as demonstrated in this article using GC–MS technique.

6.3 XRD Analysis
Characterization of
the PSM was determined using the X-ray diffraction instrument model
D8 advance, X’ Pert High Score Plus V3e software, Raw Data
Origin ASCII.

6.4 Flotation Tests
The test conditions
of scheelite flotation were using microflotation type (50 mL) purchased
from Wuhan Rock Crush and Grand Equipment Manufacture Co., Ltd. PSM
samples (2 g) were placed in deionized water (conditioning time, 1
min; rotating speed, 1850 rpm; 0.25 mL of a depressant Na2SiO3 (1.64 M); pH regulator Na2CO3 (0.2 g); and 2 mL of soap (0.02 g/mL)).

6.5 GC–MS
Analysis
The FAs of
the sunflower soap were converted to FA methyl ester using methods
described in ref (72) to analyze the compositions by GC–MS using Agilent 6890 with
a manual sampling method and a mass selective detector. The FA methyl
esters were named by comparing mass spectra with those of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) GC–MS database.

6.6 Simulation Details of Reagents and Water Molecules
MM and MC calculations force field,73,74 as implemented
in Materials Studio, were used to optimize base organic ions and water
molecules. CVFF is a generalized valence force field.75 In the CVFF force field, hydrogen bonds are a normal effect
of the standard van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic parameters;
special functions of hydrogen bond do not develop the fit of CVFF
to experimental data.76,77 Nonperiodic structures of these
molecules were optimized as rigid molecules using Forcite module.
Smart algorithm was used during geometric optimization.54 Partial charges within the atoms were computed
by employing the method of QEq,78 whereas
an atom-based method was used for nonbonded interactions. The cutoff
distance for nonbonded interactions was fixed at 15.5 Å. A buffer
width size 0.5 Å was used to create nonbonded neighbor lists
for nonbonded interactions. The optimization was studied to be converged
when a gradient of 1.0 × 10–4 kcal/mol was
achieved. The maximum number of iterations was 500, which specifies
the maximum number of geometry optimization cycles. The truncation
method was cubic spline for nonbonded interactions, and the width
of cubic spline was 1 Å. Intramolecular degrees of freedom of
base organic ions and water molecules was not considered during geometry
optimizations because it was estimated from sample data.79 Thereafter, motion groups were used to model
rigid molecules to constrain the geometries of fragments or functional
groups while allowing their location and orientation within a crystal
cell to be optimized. A rigid molecule is composed of a group of atoms;
the relative distances are fixed. Moreover, a rigid molecule inclines
to cut down the degrees of freedom number required to identify the
system configuration but it is effective in optimization of molecular
crystal structures because they permit configurations of the known
functional group to be preserved during optimization. In addition,
it decreases the time of calculation for simulation.15 In this study, the Hessian matrix has been assumed for
optimization methods and after the number of cycles was completed,
the calculations have been stopped, even if the convergence criterion
was not satisfied, and force field CVFF has gained the power to use
automatic parameters when no definite parameters were given, as seen
in the Supporting Information. The accuracy
of CVFF force field after geometry optimization was validated by comparing
the experimental data of a small water molecule65 with the calculated one, whereas the logistic accurate
prediction of adsorption locator results were validated by XPS experimental
results.

6.7 Simulation Details of Liquid–Solid
Interactions
During liquid–solid interactions, the
CVFF was adopted because it contains parameters for tungsten metal,
calcium ions, base organic ions, water, and a variety of other functional
groups. Therefore, it is suitable for the interface of scheelite with
base organic ions and water molecules. The surface cells of PSM thus
created with a cleavage plane (112) had fractional thickness and thickness of 2 and 6.211 Å, respectively.
Thereafter, a (2 × 2) supercell was created to build 19.266 and
25 Å thicknesses of vacuum slab and crystal, respectively, whereas
cleavage plane (101) had fractional thickness and thickness of 2 and 9.523 Å. Therefore,
a (2 × 2) supercell has been created to build 16.12 and 25 Å
thicknesses of vacuum slab and crystal, respectively, to expose more possible surface area
for getting in the base organic ions and water molecules. The atoms
of PSM surfaces were defined by making “an atom set”
named target atoms, and the search region was then defined such that
the distance between each of the target atoms was always equal to
or less than the specified maximum adsorption distance.15 Lastly, the adsorption locator was selected
to carry out calculation on PSM surface (112) and (101). The values
10.0 Å and 10 kcal/mol of maximum adsorption distance and fixed
energy windows were adjusted, respectively. Simulation of annealing
algorithm was used to carry out MC sampling at the fine quality level
of simulation for base organic ions and water molecules on the PSM
surface (112) and (101). The start and final temperatures were 318.15
and 283.15 K, respectively, whereas heating cycles and steps per cycle
were 5 and 50 000, respectively. Optimized structures of base
organic ions and water molecules were selected to set the value of
loading 1:15, respectively, on each PSM surface. A cleavage plane
of low energy was determined by accomplishing a search of flexible
MC of the configurational space for the base organic ions and water
molecules with PSM surfaces (112) and (101), as the temperature gradually
decreases. This process was duplicated to further distinguish a minimum
local energy. The base organic ions and water molecules within the
framework were rotated or translated in a random manner and settled
around the PSM surfaces (112) and (101). From the steps of the above
configurations, one could either accept or reject on the basis of
the selection rules of Metropolis MC. PSM surfaces (112) and (102)
were treated as a rigid body, where the coordinates of each particle
in a specified collection of particles were fixed relative to the
coordinates of all other particles in the group. The motion of atoms
of base organic ions and water molecules accrued in the surface or
below it did not affect the dynamics of the base organic ions and
water molecules.15 Fixing the atoms of
PSM surfaces has accelerated the simulation process.15 The intramolecular degrees of freedom were considered for
base organic ions and water molecules during liquid–solid interface
as a motion group, and ratios between total rotation or translation
were accepted and attempted. Theoretical data was generated by chemBioDraw
Ultra 12.0 on the characterizations of the optimized molecules and
utilized to compare with interaction energies of liquid–solid
interfaces.

7 Computational Details
Molecular simulations are accomplished using Materials Studio (V.
8, Accelrys Ltd., San Diego). It combines two modules, Forcite (is
the advanced tool of the classical MM that gives quick energy computations
and trustable optimized geometry of molecules and periodic system26) and adsorption locator (simulation module involves
the greatest success at (MC) method in statistical mechanics).25 Materials used in this article were from refs (80−84). The structure82 had an error because
its chemical name was not the same as that of the website. Therefore,
the structure was corrected according to the chemical name mentioned
in the website and this article using the tools provided with the
Material Studio software. The hydrogen atoms of the carboxyl group of all other structures
of base organic ions have been deleted to simulate negative ions in
water. And the formal charges for oxygen atoms were assigned. Thereafter,
all hydrogen atoms of negative ions and acid have been adjusted and
cleaned utilizing the sketch tool available in the software.

7.1 Monte Carlo (MC) Method
By experimentation,
a molecular system is reported by a little number of factors, such
as volume and temperature. The molecular configuration groups that
meet this partial knowledge are called a configuration ensemble.19 An ensemble is reported by a distribution function, pm, which acts as the probability of each configuration, m, in the ensemble. A configuration probability m, in the method of canonical ensemble is given by eq 1 1  where C is an arbitrary standardization
constant, β is the temperature of reciprocity, and Em is the total energy of configurations m.85 The temperature of the reciprocal
is given by eq 2 2  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.
The total energy of the configuration m is calculated
in agreement with the following eq 3 3  where EmAA is the intermolecular energy
between the adsorbate molecules and EmAS is the energy
of interaction between the adsorbate molecules and the substrate and UmA is the total intramolecular energy of the sorbate molecule. The
intramolecular energy of the substrate is not involved because its
structure is fixed during the simulation; thus, energy contributions
are fixed and vanish because only energy differences play a role in
these cases of calculations.19 The total
intramolecular energy UA is the sum of
the intramolecular energy of all adsorbate components given by eq 4 4  where m refers to
the set
of adsorbate loadings of all components in configuration m; when MC simulation has started, the configuration requires various
steps to adjust to the current temperature. A simulation is, therefore,
separated into an equilibration and a production stage. The properties
at the end of the simulation are based upon the production stage only.
In the equilibration and production stages of the simulation, each
step starts with the selection of a step type using the weights set
at the start of the simulation. The type of step can be either a rotation
or a translation. After a step, the type is selected and a random
component is chosen and the step type applies to a random species
of that component.19 For more details about
MC and Metropolis MC methods used in this study, refer to refs (86−89).

7.2 Consistent-Valence Force Field (CVFF)
The potential energy is a function of the atomic coordinates for
a molecule of N-atoms. There are 3N atomic degrees of freedom but only 3N –
6 (3N – 5 for linear molecules) are yielded
after degrees of freedom for molecular rotation and translation disappear.
Therefore, there are 3N – 6 (or 3N – 5) coordinates that describe the molecular structure and
not the molecule’s orientation and coordinate in space. These
3N – 6 (or 3N – 5)
coordinates are named internal coordinates, and mostly the lengths
of bond and angles of bond suited though not unique band. For instance,
the internal structure of a water molecule could be defined by the
two bond lengths (O–H) and the bond angle (H–O–H).
These established a band of three internal coordinates [3N – 6 = 3] for water.27 The behavior
of bond stretching or compression was well reported by the function
of Morse. The function of Morse is harmonic and correctly shows that
more energy is needed to compact a bond by a certain quantity than
to stretch it by the same quantity with reference to the equilibrium
length. In the force field of MM, the initiating stage for describing
bond compression and stretching is the harmonic approximation. The
easiest approach is to employ a function of quadratic potential energy, Es = Ks(l – lo), where Ks is the force constant, l is the actual
bond length, and lo is the natural bond
length, better described as the reference bond length. This reference
value is in common but not the same as the bond length of equilibrium
for that bond type in any true molecule. The bond length of equilibrium
is an outcome of a balance between forces corresponding to Ks(l – lo) and forces such as nonbonded force, which are external
to the bond. The attractive or dispersion part of the van der Waals
(vdW) potential is generally described by a term with a 6 power, whereas
the repulsive part is described by a 12 power, as seen in the Lennard-Jones
function 12–6,90eq 5 5  where the term Do is the depth of the potential well and its unit is kcal/mol. R is the distance at which the potential reaches its minimum,
and Ro is equilibrium distance, and its
unit is angstrom.15

The computation
of electrostatic interactions mostly is established by the function
of Coulomb potential energy utilizing charges q of
the atom-centered point given by eq 6 6  where the terms qi and qj are partial charges for atoms i and j. ε is the relative dielectric
constant. C equal to 332.0647/(kcal/mol)Å/e2 is a unit conversion
factor.15

Cross-terms, which describe
interactions between angles and bond,
torsions and angles, and so on, are used in some of the more advanced
force fields. Such terms gave accurate calculations. Cross-terms characterize
structural features such as lengths of bond or angles of bond depending
on the neighboring structural features. The function of angle-bending
potential energy includes only the harmonic approximation of simple
single terms such as torsion potential energy function.90
