This work reports on the preparation
and characterization of anisotropic
composition nanoparticles based on the electrostatic binding of dodecyltrimethylammonium
surfactant to poly(acrylic acid) blocks of diblock copolymers with
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)
(PNIPAm). These nanoparticles form kinetically stable dispersions
and display liquid–crystalline cores with a micellar cubic
structure, as determined by small-angle X-ray scattering. Mixtures
with different proportions of the two block copolymers and stoichiometric
amounts of C12TA+ were prepared and their behavior
was compared with that of the parent nanoparticles. Upon heating,
dilute dispersions (0.01 and 0.1 wt %) analyzed by dynamic light scattering
display a slight decrease in the hydrodynamic radius, consistent with
the dehydration of PNIPAm and mixed PNIPAm–PEO blocks at the
shell. At higher concentrations, 2 wt %, the nanoparticles with pure
PNIPAm shell undergo macroscopic phase separation above 32 °C.
Nanoparticles with a pure PEO shell do not display temperature sensitivity.
For the mixtures, no visual change is observed, but the dynamic light
scattering results evidence the formation of clusters, whose size
and reversibility depend on the PEO/PNIPAm proportion. This indicates
the formation of mixed nanoparticles containing both PEO and PNIPAm
blocks. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy NMR analyses of
the mixtures do not show the correlation peak expected for PEO and
PNIPAm blocks in close proximity, suggesting their segregation at
the nanoparticle shell. On the basis of these results, we discuss
the possibilities of the neutral blocks distribution on the shell
of mixed nanoparticles. Overall, we have confirmed that these nanoparticles
may display a temperature-controlled reversible aggregation while
preserving their internal liquid–crystalline structures.

Introduction
Preparation and design
of nanoparticles for applications as building
blocks of highly ordered structures have attracted much attention
in the last years, especially due to the possibility to design and
control self-assembled systems whose structures are sensitive to external
stimuli1 such as temperature,2,3 light,2 pH,4,5 redox potential,
among others.

An additional level of organization can be achieved
by systems
with attractive domains on their surface such as Patchy particles
or with a strictly biphasic geometry such as Janus nanoparticles.6,7 These systems present directional interactions and offer an additional
level of organization because they can self-assemble to form diverse
supramolecular structures, creating complex three-dimensional architectures.8 In addition, this anisotropic characteristic
leads to novel morphologies and diverse potential nanotechnological
applications for cosmetics, drug delivery,9,10 or
surface coating.11,12

Patchy and Janus nanoparticles
have been explored by some theoretical
studies and described in detail by the experimental studies involving
different polymers. Walther et al.,13 for
example, prepared mixed aggregates with block terpolymers with two
outer hydrophilic blocks of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and the thermoresponsive
poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAm). Higher temperatures
triggered the collapse of PNIPAm chains and anisotropic composition
Patchy and Janus superstructures were observed when the contour length
of the thermoresponsive block was longer than that of the PEO chains.

PNIPAm is one of the best-known temperature responsive polymers.
Although most synthetic water-soluble polymers become more soluble
upon heating, PNIPAm, among a few others, phase separates from water
because of its lower critical solution temperature (LCST). When the
temperature is lower than its LCST, PNIPAm is hydrophilic and soluble
through hydrogen bonding with water molecules, but it becomes dehydrated
and precipitates from water upon heating, displaying a sharp coil
to globule transition around 32 °C.14,15

Another study from Gröschel et al.16 reported the conversion of multicompartment micelles into
Janus
nanoparticles based on the self-assembly of ABC triblock terpolymers
of polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), cross-linking of polybutadiene, and solvent
selectivity. They also showed that the Janus balance could be tuned
by varying the block lengths. Compared with triblock copolymers, the
structures of complex aggregates formed by two different diblock copolymers
are conveniently tunable because the ratio of the mixed shell can
be adjusted by the relative content of the two diblock copolymers.9 Then different ratios are achieved by the addition
of different amounts of the diblocks instead of a synthetic step to
increase the block length.

A similar approach was followed by
Voets et al.17 while studying the structure
and behavior in a solution
of complex coacervate core micelles and their temperature dependence.
Through the coacervation of mixtures of oppositely charged diblock
copolymers poly(N-methyl-2-vinyl pyridinium iodide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide), P2MVP38-b-PEO211, and poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide), PAA55-b-PNIPAAm88, a core–shell structure was obtained.
They proposed that the ionic blocks would form the cores by electrostatic
interaction and that the neutral PEO and PNIPAm blocks would form
their shells. They found that PEO and PNIPAm chains appear to be randomly
mixed within the micellar shell at a low temperature but change to
a segregated core–shell-corona arrangement above 32 °C.
Along the same line, an earlier study from our group has shown that
Janus gold nanoparticles covered by thiolated PEO and PNIPAm were
obtained because of the spontaneous segregation of the polymers, even
at room temperature.18

Association
between polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged surfactant
is based on both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Svensson
et al.19 performed the first studies of
complex salts of poly(acrylic acid) with cationic quaternary ammonium
surfactants, observing different bulk liquid–crystalline phases
depending on the chain length of the surfactant used and on the composition
of the system. These complex salts are prepared at fixed stoichiometry
with a complete charge neutralization.20

With the introduction of neutral polymeric blocks in the complex
salts, also called neutral block complex salts, a core–shell
aggregate was obtained by Vitorazi et al.21 using poly(acrylamide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) copolymers.
Their self-assembly produced the dispersions of nanoparticles with
a liquid–crystalline core, either micellar cubic or hexagonal,
depending on whether dodecyltrimethylammonium or hexadecyltrimethylammonium
surfactants were used, that was exactly the same obtained for complex
salts formed by these surfactants and poly(acrylic acid). More recently,
we reported that the internal structure of neutral block complex salts
could be tuned by the controlled addition of n-alcohols to produce
a wide variety of mesophases such as micellar cubic, direct, and inverse
hexagonal, lamellar, and inverted micelles.22

In the present study, we aim at preparing thermoresponsive
nanoparticles
with a liquid–crystalline core from the mixtures of neutral
block copolymer salts containing PEO and PNIPAm blocks. The effect
of temperature on the liquid–crystalline core structure and
the aggregation of the nanoparticles is investigated. From the characterization
of the nanoparticles, we discuss whether there is segregation among
PEO and PNIPAm blocks and, if this happens, how their chains are distributed
in the shell.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-b-acrylic acid),
PNIPAm212-b-PAA138, with nominal
molar mass of 10 000 (PAA)
and 24 000 (PNIPAm), with Mw/Mn = 1.33, and poly(ethylene oxide-b-acrylic acid), PEO136-b-PAA72, with nominal molar mass of 5200 (PAA) and 6000 methyl terminal
(PEO), with Mw/Mn = 1.15, were purchased from Polymer Source, Inc. (Dorval,
Quebec, Canada). Their gel permeation chromatography curves, as provided
by the manufacturer, display only one elution peak and were used as
received. The surfactant C12TABr was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
with 99% purity and used with no further purification in an ion-exchange
step to obtain the hydroxide form C12TAOH. The water used
throughout was of MilliQ grade. The structures of the polymers used
in this work are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of the diblock copolymers used in
this study.

Preparation of Neutral
Block Complex Salts
Neutral
block complex salts of PNIPAm and complex salts of PEO were prepared
by the titration of the hydroxide form of the cationic surfactant
solution in water, with the acid form of the polyion to the charge
neutralization point at pH 8.5, following the methodology proposed
by Svensson et al.19 For the mixtures,
the surfactant was titrated over an aqueous solution of PEO-b-PAA and PNIPAm-b-PAA in the desired proportion
of (PNIPAm:PEO wt %). Solutions were freeze-dried and the white powders
obtained were kept in a desiccator before dispersion in water at the
desired concentration. The resulting complex salts are identified
in terms of their copolymer composition, as explained in Table 1.

Preparation of Dispersions
Complex
salts and water
were weighed at the desired composition (typically 2 wt %) and dispersed
for about 60 s by a Vortex-Genie 2 mixer (Scientific Industries) operating
at 3200 rpm. After that, they were left to equilibrate for at least
1 day prior to analyses. The samples with lower concentrations were
prepared from the dilution of the previous ones. The pH of these complex
salt dispersions remained around the equivalence point, as checked
by direct pH measurements.

Samples Characterization
Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS)
DLS measurements were
performed on samples using a scattering angle θ = 90° on
a CGS-3-based compact goniometer system (ALV-GmbH, Langen, Germany),
which was equipped with a detection system in a pseudo–cross-geometry,
with a 22 mW He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm) and an ALV 7004
multi-tau correlator. cis-Decalin was used as the refractive index-matching
liquid. The temperature was controlled at 25.00 or 45.00 ± 0.01
°C. The samples with 0.01 and 0.1 wt % concentration were placed
in capped test tubes previously washed with Hellmanex 3%.

A
Malvern Nano Zetasizer instrument at 25 and 45 °C, with a 632.8
nm laser and a detector positioned at 173°, was used for analyzing
the samples with a concentration of 2 wt % of neutral block complex
salt. For these samples, due to their high turbidity, the NIBS (noninvasive
backscatter optics)23 was used to attenuate
multiple-scattering effects related to a high concentration. The obtained
intensity time-correlation functions were analyzed by the cumulant
method, which provided the Z-average radius.24,25

ζ Potential
The measurements of 0.01 wt % samples
were performed with a Malvern Nano Zetasizer instrument at an angle
of 12.8°. The ζ potential was calculated from the measured
electrophoretic mobility using the Smoluchowski factor, f = 1.5 and the Henry equation: Ue = εζf/6πη, where Ue is the electrophoretic mobility, ε
is the dielectric constant of water, η is the viscosity of water,
and ζ is the zeta potential.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
(SAXS)
The SAXS measurements
were performed using the D11A-SAXS1 beamline from the Brazilian Synchrotron
Light Laboratory (LNLS, CNPEM, Campinas, Brazil). Samples of 2 wt
% concentration were injected into a sample holder closed by two mica
windows, except for the solid samples, which were sealed in a Kapton
sandwich. The radiation wavelength was λ = 1.550 Å and
the scattering patterns were recorded under vacuum. The scattered
intensity as a function of the scattering vector, I(q), was obtained for a q range
of 0.01–4 nm–1. FIT2D software was used to
correct the intensities for the detector response and the dark current
signal to subtract the solvent scattering and to convert the two-dimensional
(2D) SAXS images to one-dimensional distributions of scattered intensity.

1H NOESY NMR
The experiment of the nanoparticles
of 1 wt % of C12N57E43 in D2O were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance-500 spectrometer,
operating at 500 MHz and at 45 °C on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer,
operating at 400 MHz. NOESY spectra were acquired with 2048 ×
256 data points recorded at 25 and 45 °C, using the standard
Bruker software with mixing time of 400 and 800 ms.

High-Sensitivity
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
The DSC measurements were
performed with 1 wt % aqueous dispersions
of the neutral block complex salts using a VP-DSC (MicroCal, Northampton,
MA) calorimeter in the range of 20–60 °C at the scanning
rate of 1.0 °C/min. The samples were thermally equilibrated for
10 min before each scan. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate
with good agreement among all of the runs. The baseline reference
(water vs water) was subtracted from the sample thermograms. For instrument
control, acquisition, and data analyses, MicroCal Origin 5.0 and OriginPro
8 softwares were used.

UV–Visible (UV–Vis) Spectroscopy
The
spectroscopy was used to determine the turbidity of neutral block
copolymer salt dispersions as a function of temperature. The measurements
were performed using an HP 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer at
the wavelength of 410 nm and the UV–vis ChemStation software.
Samples of 0.1 wt % were analyzed at a heating rate of 1.5 °C/min
by an HP 89090A temperature controller in the range of 20–50
°C.

Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy
The cryo-TEM
samples were prepared utilizing a controlled environment vitrification
system (CEVS). The chamber was kept at the target temperature saturated
with water vapor to prevent any water evaporation from the sample.
A small droplet (3.2 μL/0.5 wt %) of the sample was applied
on a Lacey Carbon 300 Mesh grid both kept at either 25 or 45 °C.
After 20 s, the sample was blotted and plunged into liquid ethane
at its freezing point. The vitreous specimen was kept under liquid
nitrogen until loaded into a cryogenic sample holder. Imaging was
performed at the Brazilian Nanotechnology National Laboratory (LNNano)
with a FEI Talos F200C microscope operating at 200 kV equipped with
a Ceta 16 Mpixel camera.

Results
Core Structure—SAXS
Measurements
First, we investigated
the internal structures of the aggregates via SAXS analyses. The SAXS
curves show information related to the internal structure of the aggregates
as shown in Figure 2. The relative positions of the diffraction peaks (21/2, 41/2, 51/2, 61/2, and 81/2) are associated with the cubic phase Pm3n present in all of the systems.

Figure 2 SAXS curves of 2 wt %
dispersions of C12E100, C12N57E43, C12N75E25, C12N92E8, and C12N100 at 25 and 45 °C (respective
wine curves).

The additional peaks
appear at 1.74 and 2.28 nm–1 (relative positions
31/2 and 51/2) for samples
containing PNIPAm-b-PAA copolymer at room temperature.
Interestingly, they disappear when the samples are heated to 45 °C.
We could not unequivocally ascribe those peaks to any of the common
structures reported for complex salt mesophases. Increasing the temperature
shifts the SAXS curves to slightly higher q values
and favors the appearance of only cubic Pm3n liquid–crystalline phase. Overall, temperature
has no major effect on the structure of Pm3n mesophase, with all of the systems displaying a micellar
cubic phase (Figure 2), essentially the same reported for the bulk mixture of the same
surfactant, polyacrylate, and water.26

The cubic cell parameter a was calculated from
the angular coefficient of plot of (q/2π)2 versus Miller index of Pm3n phase at 25 and 45 °C, as described in eq 1. The results are reported in Table 2. 1  where q is the scattering
vector and h, k, l are the Miller indexes of Pm3n phase.

Visual Observation of Temperature
Effect
Samples of
all of the complex salts at 2 wt % are turbid and white at room temperature
(Figure 3a). The vials
shown in Figure 3b
were equilibrated for 10 min at 45 °C and then immediately inverted,
revealing that only the sample of C12N100 macroscopic
phase separates to form a viscous gel that sticks to the glass vial
after increasing the temperature to above the LCST of PNIPAm. With
increasing temperature, the dehydration of PNIPAm starts to occur,
and the nanoparticles form clusters to avoid contact with water. No
visual change was observed for C12E100 or C12NxEy samples, indicating that the presence of PEO chains stabilizes the
formed structures against the effects of PNIPAm dehydration upon heating.
Further tests increasing the equilibration time at 45 °C were
performed up to 24 h and the results are the same shown for 10 min
of equilibration.

Figure 3 Macroscopic effect of temperature increase from (a) 25
°C
to (b) 45 °C on nanoparticles at 2 wt % of (1) C12E100, (2) C12N57E43,
(3) C12N75E25, (4) C12N92E8, and (5) C12N100. In (b), the vials were inverted after 10 min of equilibration at
45 °C to reveal that the macroscopic phase-separated sample sticks
to the glass vial (red arrow).

We should also mention that for 0.01 and 0.1 wt % and at
45 °C,
no sign of macroscopic phase separation could be identified in any
sample, even for C12N100 nanoparticles; but
this may be difficult to visualize due to the low concentration of
complex salt present.

DLS Measurements of Diluted Samples
To further investigate
the nanoparticle response to temperature changes, we performed the
DLS measurements as a function of temperature and at different concentrations.
For the samples of concentrations between 0.01 and 0.1 wt %, the intensity
of scattered light is not affected by multiple scattering, we observed
a unimodal relaxation time distribution (Figures S1 and S2) and a nondiffusive regime represented by a nonlinear
interdependence between Γ and q2 (Figure S4).

The calculated nanoparticle
sizes are listed as apparent hydrodynamic radii, RH, in Table 2 for the two concentrations and at temperatures below and above LCST.
For all of the samples with concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 wt %, the
size is close to that reported for similar nanoparticles prepared
with block copolymer complex salts containing poly(acrylamide) as
the neutral block,21 even with cores with
geometry of different mesophases.22 Data
from the samples at 0.01 wt % in Table 2 reveal that the size of nanoparticles increases as
the amount of PNIPAm is increased except for the nanoparticles of
C12N100, whose size is similar to that of C12N57E43. Moreover, at 0.01 and 0.1 wt
%, there is no sign of nanoparticle aggregation or clusters when the
temperature is raised above LCST of PNIPAm. On the contrary, there
is a slight decrease in RH values, except
for the samples of C12E100, which is consistent
with the dehydration of nanoparticle shells containing PNIPAm.

Another factor that should be taken to account is that these nanoparticles
bear a negative surface charge (Table 2) that may be responsible for hampering their aggregation.
For this reason, the DLS measurements were also performed with these
diluted samples in the presence of varying amounts of NaCl (Table S1), but the values for the hydrodynamic
radii remained essentially the same, even upon heating. Addition of
NaCl slightly affects the nanoparticles’ internal structure,
increasing the cubic cell parameters, possibly due to partial screening
of the electrostatic attraction and, at much higher concentrations
(above 0.1 mol L–1), destroys the internal liquid–crystalline
structure.21,27,28

DSC and Turbidity Measurements
High-sensitivity DSC
(Figure 4) measurements
of dispersions at 1 wt % revealed a clear endothermic peak around
32 °C, related to the PNIPAm dehydration for the nanoparticles
containing only PNIPAm copolymer and their mixtures with PEO, confirming
that PNIPAm chains undergo the expected transition.

Figure 4 DSC curves for C12N100 and C12N57E43 at 1 wt % analyzed in three consecutive
runs, indicating PNIPAm dehydration upon heating (endothermic peak).

Sample turbidity was also followed
as a function of temperature
for dispersions at 0.01 wt % (Figure 5). For the samples of C12N100, a clear turbidity increase is observed. On the other hand, no change
in turbidity is observed for C12E100 nanoparticles.
For their mixtures, a small turbidity increase is observed starting
at 32 °C, consistent with the dehydration of PNIPAm chains detected
by DSC. Because no aggregation
of nanoparticles was observed at this range of concentration, this
increase in turbidity is most likely associated with an increase in
the scattered light due to changes in the refractive index as a result
of PNIPAm dehydration, as already reported.29

Figure 5 Turbidity
of C12N100 and C12NxEy at 0.1 wt
% as a function of temperature.

DLS Measurements on Concentrated Samples (2 wt %)
To
clarify the possible influence of concentration on the nanoparticles
behavior, light-scattering measurements were performed on 2 wt % samples.
At this concentration and low temperature (25 °C), the samples
of C12E100 and C12N57E43 display similar nanoparticle sizes (Table 2). As the fraction of PNIPAm increases, there
is an increase in the nanoparticle size that might be related to the
presence of more (and longer) PNIPAm chains, which additionally turn
nanoparticles less hydrophilic.

At a higher temperature (45
°C), C12E100 nanoparticles remain at the
same size, C12N57E43 nanoparticles
shrink slightly, probably due to the collapse of PNIPAm chains, as
observed for the dilute dispersions above, and nanoparticles with
higher PNIPAm contents present a significant increase in the size,
which must be associated with their temperature-induced aggregation.
Interestingly, after cooling, most systems recover their initial sizes,
except for C12N92E8 and C12N100, even after 24 h. These systems with large contents
of PNIPAm display only partial reversibility of their aggregates,
possibly due to entanglements of the larger PNIPAm blocks. For sample
C12N75E25, the content of hydrophilic
PEO blocks is sufficient to obstruct this effect and make the aggregation
fully reversible.

SAXS Results at Low q Range
To understand
the effects of the nanoparticle shell composition and the temperature
on aggregation, we explored the SAXS data at a low q ranging from 0.12 to 0.7 nm–1. For that, the SAXS
curves are presented in logarithmic scales, as shown in Figure 6a,b.

Figure 6 SAXS curves presented
in logarithmic scales of aqueous samples
C12E100, C12N100, and
C12NxEy of 2 wt % at (a) 25 °C and (b) 45 °C.

C12E100 and C12N100 nanoparticles display distinct profiles at a low q range, though for the mixtures there is a gradual change from one
limit to the other. For C12E100, a damped oscillation
corresponding to the nanoparticle form factor is observed. For complex
salts with increasing PNIPAm content, this oscillation gradually disappears.
Berret et al.30 have investigated similar
systems of surfactants and block copolymers by small-angle neutral
scattering and applied a standard Monte-Carlo algorithm to simulate
a “cage” model of micelles for the nanoparticle core.
For dilute samples, they observed the damped oscillation, which gradually
disappears with increase in the concentration of nanoparticles. This
behavior was justified by the occurrence of an interparticle structure
factor, which culminates in the appearance of an interference peak
around 0.09 nm–1 for very concentrated samples (>15
wt %). The observable range of q in Figure 6 does not allow us to verify
the appearance of an interference peak. However, the observed trend
indicates that increasing the content of PNIPAm increases the structure
factor between the nanoparticles, in the same way as observed by Berret
et al. with increasing sample concentration. It is an indication that
the higher the PNIPAm content, the higher the nanoparticle tendency
to aggregation, in accordance with the DLS results for the samples
with the same concentration (2 wt %).

Except for C12E100, the samples of all of
the complex salts present a different scattering profile at a low q range upon heating to 45 °C (Figure 6b). The change must be due to both the shell
contraction and the aggregation of the nanoparticles, evidenced by
DLS for C12N100 and C12NxEy nanoparticles at temperatures
higher than LCST of PNIPAm.

Colloidal Stability
Regarding the
colloidal stability
of these systems, the complex salts reported in this study form aqueous
dispersions, which are observed to phase separate in a few weeks time
for the samples prepared at 2 wt %. It is interesting to notice that
their size does not seem to vary significantly with the preparation
method, as also reported earlier for another neutral block complex
salt21 and that they always display a reproducible
liquid–crystalline core. Nanoparticles present the ζ
potential values around −30 mV (Table 2) for all of the samples at 25 and 45 °C,
the charge being an important factor for kinetic stability.25 The origin of the negative charge has been discussed
before22 and is related to the surfactant
dissociation into the aqueous continuous phase. In addition, our preliminary
observations indicate that the dispersions of C12E100 complex salts are more stable than the ones containing
both PEO and PNIPAm blocks (C12NxEy), as less phase separation is observed
compared with the mixtures as a function of time.

Segregation
of PEO and PNIPAm Chains—1H NOESY
NMR Results
Another issue investigated is whether there is
a segregation between the different polymer blocks, PEO, and PNIPAm.
To clarify this question, we performed the NMR NOESY experiments that
have been already applied to mixtures of these two polymer blocks.31,32 This technique is useful to determine whether specific protons not
covalently bonded are in close proximity (d <
0.5 nm). 1H NOESY NMR measurements were performed for C12N57E43 at 25 and 45 °C. If the
PEO and PNIPAm chains are randomly distributed, cross-correlation
peaks are expected to appear in the positions indicated by the red
circles of Figure 7a,b at 3.64 ppm from PEO and at 1.09 ppm from PNIPAm. The obtained
NMR spectra do not contain these correlation peaks as an indication
of no close proximity between the different polymer chains.

of C12N57E43 dispersed in D2O at (a) 25 °C and (b) 45 °C. Red circles indicate positions
where the cross peaks corresponding to the chemical shifts of the
most intense peak for each polymer (PEO and PNIPAm) would be expected,
in case of chain proximity. Individual 1H NMR are shown
in Figure S8.

At 45 °C, a downfield shift in the peak position is
observed;
besides, peaks attributed to PNIPAm are broadened due to low diffusion
and formation of bigger objects; as a consequence, they are more difficult
to attribute. Other than that, the absence of correlation peaks is
the same observed at lower temperature.

Surface Tension Measurements
If the segregation of
PEO and PNIPAm blocks leads to the anisotropic composition (Patchy
or Janus) nanoparticles, one may expect that the nanoparticles display
surface activity, as reported for other systems.33 For this reason, we performed surface tension measurements
using 0.25 wt % dispersions of nanoparticles with pure copolymers
and their mixtures. The results (shown as Table S2) reveal low surface tension values, around 32 mN/m even
for dispersion of C12N100 or C12E100, probably due to the dissociation of surfactant ions from
the nanoparticle core, already mentioned to explain the negative value
of ζ potential for these nanoparticles. As such, these results
are not conclusive and may only indicate that the nanoparticles are
not more surface active than the dissociated surfactant ions.

Cryo-TEM
Analyses
To further investigate these nanoparticles,
we also performed some cryo-TEM analyses of C12N75E25 nanoparticles from 25 to 45 °C. The resulting
images are shown in Figure 8. These images do not allow enough resolution to observe the
liquid–crystalline structure of the nanoparticles core, but
they allow visualization of roughly spherical nanoparticles displaying
sizes ranging from 20 to 120 nm. Overall, these observations agree
with the DLS results listed in Table 2 at 0.01 wt %, considering that RH values are expected to be larger. Particle size estimated
from cryo-TEM images is expected to be smaller than the one derived
from the DLS data because the latter contains contributions from the
particles’ hydration shell and from scattering of larger particles.
The present DLS data are consistent with a polydisperse system, but
not bimodal, as can be seen in Figures S5 and S6). The images at 45 °C suggest slightly smaller nanoparticles
forming bigger aggregates. Although PEO and PNIPAm show very low contrast
in cryo-TEM, from Figure 8d we can confirm that PNIPAm transition should control the
final assembly.

Discussion
Internal Core
Structure
For the discussion on the properties
of these core–shell nanoparticles, we will start with their
internal liquid–crystalline structure. In our first study with
this type of system,21 we reported that
the internal order was only achieved when titrating the surfactant
to the opposite-charge polymer solution (complex salts), as opposed
to directly mixing solutions of surfactants and polymers, even if
at the exact composition to produce a charge neutrality.34 The structure of the nanoparticles core reproduces
exactly the one that was obtained with complex salts prepared with
the cationic surfactant and polyacrylate.26

In the present study, we observed that the same cubic micellar Pm3n structure is also obtained when the
block copolymer complex salt is formed by PEO or PNIPAm neutral blocks,
suggesting an insensitivity of this ordering to either the presence
or the nature of the hydrophilic block. Two other peaks from a nonidentified
phase are present for the samples containing PNIPAm blocks at room
temperature. Some of these peaks according to the sequence 31/2 and 51/2 are expected for an hcp mesophase, but other
peaks are missing. The hcp mesophase was reported to appear for complex
salts in systems based on dodecyltrymethyammonium surfactant and polyacrylate35 and also ethoxylated complex salts of hexyltrymethylammonium
surfactant.36 In both cases, the hcp appearance
was related to either shorter surfactant alkyl chains or lower charge
density of copolymer. However, with the present results, we cannot
unequivocally ascribe those peaks to an hcp mesophase.

If one
assumes that these nanoparticles are close to spherical
and, according to the DLS results, with radius over 100 nm, the core
must contain a significant fraction of hydrophilic blocks. It is most
likely that they remain hydrated, hence at the shell for the surfactant
aggregates. In this respect, it seems more surprising that for PNIPAm-containing
complex salts, the Pm3n internal
structure remains unaltered at 45 °C, except for the peaks attributed
to the nonidentified phase, which disappears above the LCST of PNIPAm.
At this temperature, PNIPAm blocks are dehydrated, as confirmed by
the DSC results, and are expected to be more incorporated into the
hydrophobic interior of micelles.

Earlier studies with the incorporation
of hydrophobic solutes into
complex salt aggregates37 indicate that
compounds such as p-xylene or cyclohexane are incorporated
into the surfactant micelles (in that case, cylinders of a hexagonal
phase), causing an increase in their radius due to swelling. Our present
results indicate that the center-to-center distance between adjacent
micelles, defined by the cubic cell parameter, remains constant. This
finding is not inconsistent with a swelling of the micelles due to
the incorporation of PNIPAm blocks, only indicating that the balance
between attraction–repulsion forces among micelles remains
the same.

Nanoparticles Composition and Aggregation
With respect
to nanoparticles composition, one could envisage two limit cases for
the complex salt of a mixture of two different block copolymers: (a)
the formation of pure individual nanoparticles or (b) the formation
of fully mixed ones, as sketched in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Schematic representation of two limit possibilities
for nanoparticles
of C12NxEy. (a) Due to the segregation of PEO and PNIPAm blocks, there
is the formation of two different populations of nanoparticles. (b)
The different block copolymers are completely randomly distributed
in all of the nanoparticles formed.

The best way to assess this issue is by analyzing the effects
of
temperature on these mixed nanoparticles, considering that the ones
with only PEO are not affected by temperature, whereas ones with only
PNIPAm are. The DSC results confirm that, even in the mixture, PNIPAm
blocks dehydrate around 32 °C (see Figure 4). This is also supported by the turbidity
measurements that are consistent with an increase in the refractive
index expected as a consequence of PNIPAm dehydration.

Results
from visual observation and DLS and SAXS measurements as
a function of temperature indicate that the mixed nanoparticles always
display an intermediary behavior between those of the pure nanoparticles,
sometimes with a trend of convergence as the PNIPAm content increases.
Moreover, the relaxation time distributions with two populations of
different sizes are not present for the samples of C12NxEy. If here was
one population related only to C12E100 nanoparticles,
it would not vary in size after temperature increase, whereas a second
population related to C12N100 nanoparticles
would change the size above 32 °C. These are strong evidences
in favor of the formation of mixed nanoparticles, and that their composition
follows that of the global mixture.

DLS measurements as a function
of temperature do not reveal any
increase in size induced by heating for the samples at low concentrations
(up to 0.1 wt %), indicating that no aggregation occurs. In fact,
the hydrodynamic radii display a slight decrease upon heating, which
could be ascribed to dehydration and collapse of the PNIPAm chains.
Due to the different molar masses of PNIPAm (M =
24000 g mol–1) and PEO (M = 5200
g mol–1), it seems reasonable to have C12E100 nanoparticles slightly smaller in size than PNIPAm
ones, and that their collapse leads to an overall decrease in the
nanoparticle size. It is not clear, at this stage, why pure PNIPAm
nanoparticles at low concentration do not aggregate upon heating,
even with the addition of NaCl to screen electrostatic repulsion.
However, DSC results confirm dehydration of their PNIPAm blocks at
32 °C. The only possible explanation would be the reduced nanoparticle
encounter due to their very low concentration. In an earlier study
with thermosensitive brush macromolecules, Lee and co-workers38 reported that aggregation above the LCST of
copolymer was only observed for concentrated solutions (5 wt % in
their case), whereas a decrease in size occurred with the increase
in temperature for dilute systems (below 0.5 wt %), similar to what
we observed. In all of the cases, the nanoparticles’ hydrodynamic
radii are similar to those found for acrylamide–acrylate complex
salt systems.21

At higher concentration
(2 wt %), both DLS and low q SAXS results confirm
the aggregation of C12N75E25, C12N92E8, and C12N100 nanoparticles, and this becomes more prominent
above LCST of PNIPAm, confirming the contribution of the PNIPAm blocks
to the thermosensitivity of the mixed nanoparticles. Although PNIPAm
dehydration is reversible14 according to
DSC results at 1 wt %, the nanoparticle aggregation could be only
fully reversed for C12N75E25, returning
immediately to their original size at 25 °C with the decrease
in temperature. As for C12N92E8 and
C12N100 nanoparticles, only partial reversibility
was observed within 24 h, possibly indicating a significant entanglement
of the longer PNIPAm blocks. In any composition, their internal Pm3n cubic micellar structure remained
unchanged. However, the nonidentified phase, present at 25 °C
in all of the samples of C12NxEy and C12N100,
disappears at 45 °C.

With respect to the arrangement of
the PEO and PNIPAM blocks, NOESY
NMR results indicate that they are segregated, even at low temperature.
Following that, one could envisage a series of possibilities for the
neutral blocks distribution at the nanoparticles shell, as we try
to represent in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Schematic representation of the models proposed for the segregation
of PEO (blue) and PNIPAm (green) blocks at the nanoparticle shell.

The following models from (a)
to (c) should represent a progressive
change on nanoparticles as the PNIPAm content is increased. In the
situation represented by Figure 10a, the relative PEO:PNIPAm ratio is high, allowing
the formation of a PEO-dominated shell. PNIPAm chains would be concentrated
in or at the interface of the surfactant micelles, making the interior
richer in PNIPAm, especially above their LCST. Micelles located closer
to the nanoparticle core should still contain PEO blocks that could
not physically reach the interface, although one cannot rule out the
possibility of a copolymer preferential migration that would enrich
the nanoparticle core with PNIPAm chains and the shell with PEO chains
while keeping the balance between surfactant and acrylate groups.
This condition is similar to that reported by Ma et al.32 of the formation of what they described as a
core–shell-corona arrangement. However, having the entire shell
or most of its surface rich in PEO chains, the nanoparticles are not
expected to form aggregates. Following this idea, the sample C12N57E43 is probably somewhere between
a PEO-dominated shell and a patchy nanoparticle model because no aggregation
is observed for 2 wt % samples, even at 45 °C.

Patchy nanoparticles
are formed when domains appear at the surface.
Such domains can either be randomly distributed or distributed over
specific directions at the shell, resulting in anisotropy. As PNIPAm
is less hydrophilic than PEO, we would expect PNIPAm to form domains
in the continuous PEO surface as more PNIPAm is added to the system.
Depending on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, the nanoparticles
can form (b), and this situation is most probable to happen when nanoparticles
are anisotropic in composition. The last case (c) represents the surface
segregation in which PEO and PNIPAm chains at the shell arrange themselves
to produce two different domains, producing Janus particles.39,40

Then samples C12N75E25 and
C12N92E8 would be classified between
Patchy
(b) and Janus nanoparticles (c). These situations would agree with
the segregation between PNIPAm and PEO chains indicated by NOESY NMR
results, although we cannot ascribe unequivocally how these domains
arrange themselves.

The striking difference is that the phase
separation was fully
reversible upon cooling the dispersions of C12N75E25, whereas those of C12N92E8 and C12N100 displayed only partial
immediate reversibility, suggesting kinetic effects due to nanoparticle
aggregation.

To ensure thermosensitivity, an excess of PNIPAm
chains is required,
but the nanoparticles aggregate to produce macroscopic phase separation
when the chains are too many (as for C12N92E8 and C12N100), although this process
is not fully reversible. Because aggregation is observed at 2 wt %
and 45 °C, PNIPAm should be present at the surface and lead to
the formation of bigger clusters with a temperature increase due to
increase in its hydrophobicity.

Some reports show that PEO and
PNIPam chains can phase segregate
even below the LCST of PNIPAm,18,41,42 so the formation of anisotropic composition surfaces, either Patchy
or Janus, can be expected at room temperature. Above the LCST, the
hydrophobic domains of PNIPAm can lead to nanoparticle aggregation
due to the different nature of the polymer blocks.

Furthermore,
the lack of correlation peaks in NOESY NMR was the
main evidence invoked by Voets and co-workers43 to propose the formation of Janus particles in a system composed
by PEO and PAAm as the hydrophilic polymer pair in aqueous solutions.
However, in another study by the same group, with coacervates of mixed
PEO and PNIPAm polymers,30 NOESY NMR spectra
showed the presence of correlation peaks. They observed temperature-induced
aggregation and proposed PNIPAm would be located in the core surrounded
by a PEO brush layer, similar to the situation in Figure 10a.

We could not find
means, by using all of the experimental information
we report here, to ascribe unequivocally the distribution of PEO and
PNIPAm blocks at the shell of the mixed nanoparticles described here.
They are most likely segregated at room temperature in a Patchy-like
configuration, although Janus nanoparticles model cannot be discarded.

Regardless of the clear discrimination on how these chains arrange
themselves at the nanoparticle shell, this approach is capable of
producing kinetically stable nanoparticles with liquid–crystalline
cores that display reversible temperature-induced phase separation.
Therefore, for the purpose of controlled aggregation and macroscopic
phase separation as means of facilitated nanoparticle removal (for
instance, for recycling), full reversibility is desirable and an intermediate
composition (in the present study, around 70 wt % of PNIPAm) is suggested.
Consequently, the combination of an ionic surfactant with two diblock
copolymers (only one of them being thermoresponsive) in the correct
ratio is crucial to achieve a fully reversible aggregation induced
by heating.

Conclusions
This study is the first
one using mixtures of neutral diblocks
on the preparation of complex salts to produce reversible thermosensitive
nanoparticles with liquid–crystalline cores. They were successfully
prepared and characterized, displaying suitable kinetic stability
and core structure, which agrees with findings of earlier reports
on similar systems. The use of two copolymers with different neutral
blocks at an optimal ratio, only one being thermosensitive (PNIPAm),
allowed successful control over their temperature-induced aggregation
and phase separation.

Several techniques have been employed
for the characterization
of the nanoparticles. The most important findings reveal that they
display sizes in the range of 150–200 nm at 0.01 wt %, with
negative ζ potentials and cryo-TEM images suggesting roughly
spherical nanoparticles. As the temperature increases, the PNIPAm
chains dehydrate and collapse around 32 °C, decreasing the nanoparticle
size. When the PNIPAm content and nanoparticle concentration increase,
the heating leads to the formation of clusters of nanoparticles and,
in some cases, to macroscopic phase separation.

The intermediary
behavior of mixed nanoparticles was important
to propose that PEO and PNIPAm chains are most likely segregated at
room temperature in a patchy-like configuration.

These results
should promote a better understanding of complex
salts obtained from mixed polymer diblocks and future application
as fast temperature–responsive system.
