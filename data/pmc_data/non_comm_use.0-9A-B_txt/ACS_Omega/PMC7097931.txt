The fabrication of
silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with different
sizes by microwave (MW)-assisted synthesis is presented. The fast
heating of the MW technique, combined with the possibility to thermally
quench the reactions, enabled us to capture snapshots of nucleation
and growth processes difficult to accomplish in other techniques.
The Ag NPs were synthesized using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) through
a polyol approach. The effects of the reaction time, the reaction
temperatures, and the silver precursor concentration were investigated.
The influence of agitation, the PVP concentration, and the initial
conditions of the silver precursor was also studied. It is found that
at very short reaction times and at low temperatures, polyhedral plates
are formed with sizes ca. 300 nm and large polydispersity. However,
by increasing the time or the temperature, a size and shape refinement
is observed resulting in 10 nm spherical NPs with low polydispersity.
Mechanistic insights are provided based on the observations extracted
from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis). A formation mechanism starting from
kinetically favored silver polyhedral plates to thermodynamically
favored spherical nanoparticles is proposed. Understanding these effects
allowed us to control the particle size and the tuning of Ag NPs on-demand.
Moreover, the reproducibility and scalability of the process and the
long-term stability of the NPs in aqueous solutions are demonstrated.
Finally, we provide a recommendation regarding the use of fresh PVP
as a capping and stabilizing agent.

1 Introduction
Every
day, nanotechnology is prevailing more in many society domains
and industrial sectors such as health, pharmaceutics, food, information
technologies, electronics, energy, or the environment.1 New applications, devices, and products derived from advances
in nanotechnology demand new nanomaterials, specifically, functional
nanoparticles (NPs). The migration of these NPs from the laboratory
to the market is proceeding at a rather slow pace and needs to be
accelerated. Thus, well-understood, reproducible, and scalable methods
for efficient NP production are needed.

Metal nanoparticles
are of particular industrial interest due to
their unique properties and applications both in technology and in
biomedicine.2−4 Their optic, catalytic, electronic, and spectroscopic
properties make them interesting in many domains. They are characterized
by a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption band. The
position of this band strongly depends not only on the type of metal
but also on its size, shape, and to a lesser extent, the dielectric
environment of the particles.5−7 Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)
are especially interesting due to their antimicrobial properties.8 They have been widely used in water and air filtration
to eliminate microorganisms9 and in the
biomedical field because of their intrinsic therapeutic properties.10 Moreover, their high electrical conductivity
and chemical stability make them the perfect material for inkjets
in electronics, photonics, biomarkers, and chemical/biological sensors.11,12

Ag NPs can be synthesized using various methods, namely chemical
reduction,13 electrochemistry,14 photochemistry,15 laser ablation,16 sonochemistry,17 and sputtering.18 Among these, the most popular method for the preparation of silver
colloids is based on the chemical reduction of the metal ions by a
reducing agent, usually the solvent, and generally in the presence
of a stabilizing agent. Typical reducing agents include polyols.19 The polyol process is commonly used for the
preparation of easily reducible metals.20 Polyols such as ethylene glycol (EG) can act as a reducing agent
and as a solvent in which the metal salts are dissolved. The most
commonly used stabilizing agents are polymers and surfactants.21 Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) is a widely used
polymer to passivate the surface of silver nanoparticles and protect
the nanoparticles from sintering.22 Polyol-mediated
synthesis can be carried out at room temperature, but higher temperatures
are generally used for higher reaction rates.20 To increase the reaction media temperature, conventional thermal
heating23 or ultrasonic irradiation24 can be employed. Many of these preparations
are limited due to long reaction times, the consumption of large volumes
of solvent, and poor stability of the products. Microwave (MW)-assisted
chemistry is an advantageous heating source that provides volumetric
uniform heating of the reaction solution (leading to narrow size distributions),
shorter reaction times, lower energy consumption, and high product
yield.25−27 Microwave ovens permit the synthesis of many types
of inorganic nanoparticles, from single component (metals and metal
oxides)28 to multicomponent nanoparticles
or metastable alloys.29−31

One of the most powerful advantages of the
MW technique is that
it is rapid.25−27 Its fast heating velocity, combined with the possibility
to thermally quench the reactions, enabled us to grasp snapshots of
nucleation and growth processes difficult to accomplish in other techniques.
Consequently, some mechanistic insights can be extracted as well as
information on competing kinetics and thermodynamics processes, permitting
the stabilization of metastable phases. These advantages can lead
to a greater understanding of the key parameters to obtain a wide
range of desired products, as well as to control the size and shape
of NPs to yield desirable chemical and physical properties.

Here, we report a systematic and detailed study of the diverse
scenarios of Ag NP synthesis mapping several synthetic conditions
such as the reaction time, the reaction temperature, and the silver
precursor concentration. Platelet-like kinetically favored Ag structures
could be obtained for the first time using highly reducing conditions
benefitting from the very short reaction times of the MW-assisted
synthesis as opposed to thermodynamically favored morphologies such
as spheres obtained at longer reaction times and higher temperatures.32−35 A formation mechanism from silver polyhedral plates to spherical
nanoparticles is proposed. Understanding these effects allowed us
to control the particle size and the tuning of Ag NPs on-demand. Moreover,
the reproducibility and scalability of the process were demonstrated.
Finally, this study provides a recommendation regarding the use of
PVP as a capping and stabilizing agent through a polyol approach.

2 Results and Discussion
Fast synthesis of metal (Au)
and metal oxide (Fe2O3, TiO2) nanoparticles
by MW-assisted chemistry,
as well as their combination in hybrid nanostructures, was previously
reported by our group.29−31 Here, Ag nanoplates and nanoparticles are synthesized
by a polyol approach using AgNO3 as the precursor, ethylene
glycol (EG) as the solvent and the reducing agent, and polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) as the reducing and capping agent.

2.1 Effect
of the Reaction Time
The effect
of the reaction time on the resulting Ag NPs was investigated using
1 mM AgNO3, 120 °C reaction temperature, and synthesis
times of 10 s, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min; the results are shown in Figure 1. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) micrographs confirmed the successful formation of
nanoparticles in all conditions and depict the differences in terms
of particle size, shape, and polydispersity. For all particles, selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed a face-centered
cubic metallic silver as the sole crystalline phase (Figure S1). At 10 s, an extremely short reaction time, particles
display various shapes, commonly polyhedral plates such as triangles
and hexagons and mean sizes larger than 300 nm with a large polydispersity
of sizes, as can be observed in Figure 1a. Similar results are obtained at 1 min reaction time,
with a size reduction (∼200 nm). The particle size is further
reduced at longer reaction times. At 2 min reaction time, the majority
of the population consisted of small, spherical, and monodisperse
NPs (PDI < 30%) (Figure 1b–d). Particles have a mean size of 9 ± 3, 12
± 3, and 13 ± 4 nm at 2, 5, and 10 min, respectively, resulting
from the fitting of the size histogram to a Gaussian distribution.
A minority population of larger particles was also observed with mean
sizes of ∼150 nm for 2 and 5 min reaction times. Thus, by increasing
the reaction time from seconds to 10 min, particles experience a size
refinement where the initial nanoplates steadily disappear in favor
of spherical monodispersed nanoparticles. Moreover, above 2 min of
the reaction, the longer the reaction time, the bigger the particles.

TEM observations were confirmed by UV–vis
spectroscopy. Figure 1e shows the absorbance
spectra for these materials. In all cases, one single peak corresponding
to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag NPs is observed.
It is well established that the shape, size, and composition of metal
nanoparticles are crucial in determining the LSPR spectral position.5−7 According to the previous size distributions, polydisperse samples
of 10 s and 1 min have a broad LSPR peak, while monodisperse samples
from 2, 5, and 10 min reaction times have a narrow one. Moreover,
the wavelength of the maximum of the UV–vis bands shifted from
438 nm at 10 s to 403 nm at 10 min, due to the smaller size and isotropic
shapes. Figure 1f shows
the mean sizes vs reaction times of Ag NPs.

2.2 Effect
of the Reaction Temperature
The effect of the reaction temperature
was investigated by using
1 mM AgNO3, 10 min reaction time, and synthesis temperatures
of 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 °C, and the results are shown in Figure 2. At 60 °C,
a slight color change on the reaction tube was observed, but no precipitate
was collected. This indicates that at this low temperature, no nucleation
occurs. However, the tube changed its color to the expected orange-yellow
after being stored one night, due to the room temperature reduction
of silver cations for a longer time by EG and PVP acting as the reducing
agents. Indeed, the chemical reduction reaction involved in this system
is kinetically controlled.

Figure 2 Effect of the reaction temperature (at 10 min
and 1 mM AgNO3). (a–d) Representative TEM images
of the different
reaction temperatures analyzed (90, 120, 150, and 180 °C, respectively).
(e) UV–vis measurements of the same samples. The inset contains
digital images of the samples. (f) Mean size evolution with temperature
(the error bars represent the standard deviation over the population
mean). Inset: scheme of the Ag NP evolution with the reaction temperature.

When the temperature is increased to 90 °C,
NPs were formed
after 10 min of the reaction. Figure 2a shows a representative TEM image of the sample, in
which two populations are observed: a minority—bigger, polydisperse,
with polyhedral shapes and with an average size of around 150 nm;
and a majority—smaller, monodisperse and spherical with 9 ±
3 nm size. These results are almost the same as those found for the
reaction time sample of 2 min (Figure 1b), heated at 120 °C. It shows how the system
heated at higher temperatures displays an accelerated reduction; therefore,
in 2 min at 120 °C, the same particles are formed as in 10 min
at 90 °C.

At 120 °C (Figure 2b), the Ag NPs were identical to the sample
reported in Figure 1d. Thus, the reproducibility
of MW-assisted syntheses is demonstrated. On increasing the temperature
further, the most significant observation was the gradual increase
in the mean particle size and the loss of monodispersity. Specifically,
particles have an average size of 14 ± 5 and 15 ± 6 nm at
150 and 180 °C, respectively. The loss of monodispersity is attributed
to the fact that at higher temperatures, particles start to fuse;
aggregates are clearly observed in Figure 2c,d.

UV–vis spectra for the
samples of this series were recorded
(Figure 2e). The sample
at 90 °C has a broad LSPR peak at 405 nm wavelength, while the
most monodisperse sample (120 °C) has a narrower band with a
maximum at 403 nm. Otherwise, samples at higher temperatures (150
and 180 °C) show two broad peaks at 398 and 540 nm and at 396
and 560 nm, respectively. These secondary and red-shifted bands correspond
to the bigger and nonisotropic particles present in these samples
in accordance with TEM results. Figure 2f shows the mean sizes vs reaction temperatures of
Ag NPs.

2.3 Effect of the Silver Precursor Concentration
The effect of the silver precursor concentration was also investigated
by using 10 min reaction time, 120 °C reaction temperature, and
the synthesis concentrations of 0.5, 1, 10, 15, and 20 mM AgNO3; the results are shown in Figure 3. On increasing the concentration, the most
significant observations were the gradual increase in the average
size and the gradual increase in the number of nanoparticles (more
particles were collected). Both phenomena are likely to occur simultaneously
because of the increase of the number of silver nuclei in the initial
solution (coming from the Ag(I) reduction) with higher concentrations.
Particularly, particles have an average size determined by TEM of
12 ± 4, 11 ± 3, 15 ± 3, 17 ± 3, and 20 ±
4 nm at 0.5, 1, 10, 15, and 20 mM AgNO3, respectively.
Then, in the range between 0.5 and 1 mM AgNO3, particles
are spherical, monodisperse, and have a similar size of around 13
nm; when the concentration is increased by 1 order of magnitude (10,
15, and 20 mM AgNO3), particles can grow up to 15, 17,
or 20 nm.

analyzed (1, 10, 15, and 20 mM, respectively). (e) UV–vis measurements
of the same samples. The inset contains digital images of the samples.
(f) Mean size evolution with concentration (the error bars represent
the standard deviation over the population mean). Inset: scheme of
the Ag NP evolution with the reaction concentration.

UV–vis spectra for the samples of this series were
recorded
(Figure 3e). The silver
LSPR band maxima were located at 398, 396, 396, 400, and 403 nm wavelengths
at 0.5, 1, 10, 15, and 20 mM AgNO3, respectively. Samples
experience a red shift with concentration according to their bigger
size, as was seen in the TEM images. Note that samples with more polydispersity
have broader LSPR bands. Figure 3f shows mean sizes vs silver precursor concentrations
of Ag NPs.

2.4 Additional Experiments
To study the
influence of agitation, the concentration of PVP, and the initial
solvent of the silver precursor, additional synthesis was also undertaken.
The synthesis conditions were always 10 min reaction time, 120 °C
reaction temperature, and 1 mM AgNO3. The influence of
agitation was studied by heating the above solution in the MW reactor
without agitation, the PVP concentration control was studied by changing
the PVP amount from 25 to 5 mg, and the silver precursor solvent control
was studied using EG instead of MQ-H2O to prepare the initial
AgNO3 solution.

When the reaction solution is not
stirred during heating, the obtained Ag NPs are polydisperse, as shown
in the TEM image (Figure 4a). Indeed, the corresponding UV–vis spectrum clearly
defines two LSPR peaks at 394 and 560 nm wavelengths (Figure 4d). Agitation results in increased
homogeneity of the final spherical Ag NPs because it avoids diffusion
control of the growth process after new nucleation of Ag(0) elements.
When the PVP concentration is reduced five times, Ag NP aggregates
are observed, implying that there is not enough stabilizer both sterically
and electrostatically (Figure 4b). Accordingly, the UV–vis spectrum of this sample
shows a broad peak at 407 nm wavelength (Figure 4d). Finally, when EG is used to prepare the
initial AgNO3 solution (instead of a small amount of water
used in the described synthesis before), no significant differences
were found. Ag NPs are spherical, monodisperse, and well stabilized
by PVP (Figure 4c)
and the corresponding UV–vis spectrum supports this (narrow
peak at 401 nm) as also for the standard sample represented in Figure 4d (10 min, 120 °C,
1 mM AgNO3 from an aqueous solution, agitation, and 25
mg of PVP).

control assays analyzed (nonagitated reaction, five times less PVP
and initial AgNO3 solution in EG, respectively). (d) UV–vis
of the same samples. The standard sample (10 min, 120 °C, 1 mM
AgNO3 from an aqueous solution, agitation, and 25 mg of
PVP) is also represented for comparison.

2.5 Mechanistic Insights
After all of
the experiments described above, some mechanistic insights can be
hypothesized. Figure 5 schematizes a simplified mechanism proposed for the formation of
the Ag NPs.

Figure 5 Schematic representation of the formation of Ag NPs. The proposed
mechanism for the formation of Ag, big, anisotropic nanostructure-like
platelets and Ag, small, spherical NPs depending on the synthetic
conditions. Notation: AgNO3, silver nitrate; t, time; T, temperature; PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone.

We have observed that the reaction starts with
anisotropic platelet-like
structures (triangles, hexagons, and truncated shapes), as shown for
the samples at 10 s, 120 °C and 10 min, 90 °C (Figures 1a and 2a, respectively). When the reduction starts, Ag atoms are
formed in the solution and tend to aggregate into small clusters or
nuclei, which then aggregate into nanoparticles.36 If the reduction is fast (high temperature for a long time),
there are enough Ag atoms to attach to the seeds’ surface for
continuous growth, tending to thermodynamically favored products.
However, if the reduction is slow (low temperature or short times
at high temperature and fast quenching), the concentration of Ag atoms
is small, and the nanocrystals will take shapes deviating from the
thermodynamically favored ones.37 This
synthesis is kinetically controlled. In this case, stacking faults
can develop and induce the formation of thin nanoplates despite their
high total energy.19,38−40 Each Ag nanoplate
is enclosed by two {111} planes as the top and bottom faces, and a
mix of {100} and {111} planes as the side faces.41 Moreover, these structures have {111} twin planes parallel
to their flat faces38 and stacking faults.7,42 Then, due to a large surface area and the lattice strain caused
by stacking faults, the formation of nanoplates is not favored in
terms of surface energy. For this reason, Ag nanoplates are kinetically
favored products.

There are different methods of achieving kinetically
controlled
synthesis of metal nanoplates: the coupling of reduction with oxidative
etching,43 the use of an extremely mild
reducing agent,44 and the use of ligands
to form complexes with Ag(I) ions.38 In
this work, note that MW heating of AgNO3 in EG in the presence
of PVP causes the reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0), where both EG and PVP
act as reducing reagents. This together with the fast heating of the
solution with the MW-assisted synthesis method allows the rapid formation
of many Ag atoms that are able to grow into thermodynamically favored
morphologies such as spheres (as it happens at long reaction times).
However, thanks to the fast heating and cooling speeds of the MW method,
we were able to capture and freeze kinetically favored products in
conditions (extremely short reaction time or very low temperature)
where a smaller number of silver nuclei were allowed to grow. Note
that the heating and the cooling velocities are high (around 1 °C/s).
Indeed, the energy barrier to achieving kinetically favored products
is lower than the one for thermodynamic ones. Thus, the reaction starts
with Ag nanoplates and it stabilizes with Ag nanospheres. Moreover,
the PVP present during the reaction can help the formation of Ag nanoplates.
When Ag(0) nucleates, free PVP adsorbs to all silver surfaces due
to the strong affinity of the Ag surface to the nitrogen of the PVP,
resulting in small, spherically shaped Ag NPs. However, decreasing
the amount of PVP could break the initial symmetry to avoid spherical
growth. During crystal growth, free PVP will preferentially adsorb
to the faces with the lowest energy. Then, selective adsorption occurs
on the {111} faces (top and bottom faces of the Ag nanocrystals),
while {100} faces (three-sided faces) continued to grow at a faster
rate. Thus, we expect that reducing further the PVP amount in the
reaction media (without compromising the NP final stability and dispersion)
could help to drive the nanoplate formation. Moreover, less PVP could
lead to the large edge length of the observed anisotropic Ag nanostructure-like
platelets (Figures 1a and 2a).

Finally, increasing the reaction
time and/or the reaction temperature
drives the system to thermodynamically favored products, such as the
spherical structures observed in Figures 1–4. Indeed,
Ag nanoplates are thermodynamically unstable in comparison with Ag
spherical particles. As a metal inside a conventional MW oven, the
big silver nanoplates can act as an antenna25,45 and absorb the MW irradiation, promoting its fracture to small particles.
Then, particles undergo a size refinement, decreasing their size and
changing their shape. In addition, at longer times, higher temperatures,
and higher silver precursor concentration, particles increase their
size (and number) due to the increased reaction that contributes to
new nucleation and growth.

2.6 Ag NPs On-Demand, Scalability
of the Protocol,
and Reaction Yield
Comprehending all of these effects allowed
us to control the particle size and the tuning of Ag NPs on demand
(Figure 6). For instance,
if bigger monodisperse Ag NPs are desired, time, concentration, and
reaction temperature (<150 °C) can be increased. A successful
test was prepared with the synthesis conditions fixed to 20 min, 130
°C, and 20 mM AgNO3. The obtained Ag NPs have a mean
size of 33 ± 14 nm (Figure S2a and
the single green dot in Figure 6). These particles are approx. 20 nm larger than the ones
of the standard sample (Figure S2b). Consequently,
a red shift was observed in their UV–vis spectrum (Figure S2c).

Figure 6 Summary of Ag NP mean sizes depending
on the synthetic conditions.
The single green dot corresponds to the planned synthesis to demonstrate
the capability of producing Ag NP with on-demand sizes, ∼30
nm in this case.

It is well known that
MW-assisted synthesis can be easily scaled
up, accelerating the migration of nanoparticles from the laboratory
to the market. We show that the synthesis presented here can be scaled
up at least by a factor of 4. To study the scalability of the protocol,
both, the same MW reactor (CEM) and a Microwave Advanced Flexible
Synthesis Platform (flexiwave) from Milestone, were used. According
to TEM images (Figure S3a,b), Ag NPs were
successfully fabricated by scaling up the synthesis by a factor of
4 with both MW reactors, having an average size of 16 ± 4 and
24 ± 4 nm when CEM and Flexiwave MW reactors were used, respectively.
In comparison with the standard sample (Figure S3c), these spherical and always monodisperse Ag NPs are bigger.
Therefore, a red shift was observed in their UV–vis spectrum
(Figure S3d). Such slight increase of the
particle size may come from the non-linear phenomena likely to occur
when one synthesis is scaled up, which should be readjusted on demand
(outside the scope of this study).

Finally, a chemical analysis
of Ag was done with inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The results showed
a chemical reaction yield of 57% for the standard sample at CEM MW
reactor, corresponding to 0.25 mg of Ag. On the other hand, when the
same CEM MW reactor was used for the four-fold scale-up, the yield
was 61% corresponding to 1.05 mg of Ag per batch. Then, the defined
MW-protocol and the cleaning steps of this work for the preparation
of Ag NPs with controlled size result, on average, in a 60% yield
and the production of silver colloids up to 1 mg. Higher quantities
should be expected when using the Flexiwave MW reactor due to its
greater scalability potential, since up to 15 reaction-vases of 100
ml can be used in one batch.

3 Conclusions
We have presented a fast, simple, reproducible, and scalable microwave-assisted
polyol synthesis of Ag NPs with different shapes and controlled sizes
by a judicious choice of the synthetic parameters such as reaction
time, reaction temperature, and silver precursor concentration. We
have hypothesized mechanistic insights for the formation of the obtained
nanoplates and nanoparticles underpinned by the observations extracted
from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis).

Very short reaction times and
low temperatures lead to a small
number of available nuclei yielding to kinetically favorable anisotropic
platelet-like structures (triangles, hexagons, and truncated shapes).
Moreover, the low amounts of PVP used facilitate breaking the initial
spherical symmetry by preferential adsorption to the {111} faces (top
and bottom faces of Ag nanocrystals), while {100} faces (three-sided
faces) continue to grow at a faster rate, leading to the anisotropic
Ag platelet-like structures. Note that platelet structures were observed
here for the first time in synthetic conditions (EG and PVP allow
high reduction rates), where for longer reaction times and higher
temperatures, there is a rapid formation of a large number of Ag nuclei
that grow into thermodynamically favored morphologies such as spheres.
Indeed, Ag nanoplates are thermodynamically unstable in comparison
with Ag spherical particles. Then, particles undergo a size refinement,
decreasing their size and changing their shape. In addition, at longer
times, higher temperatures, and higher silver precursor concentrations,
particles increase their size (and number) due to the increased reaction
that contributes to new nucleation and growth.

Understanding
these effects allowed us to control the particle
size and the tuning of Ag NPs on-demand using cross experiments. Moreover,
the reproducibility and scalability of the process and the long-term
stability -up to 9 months- of the NPs in aqueous solutions was demonstrated.
Finally, we provide a recommendation regarding the use of fresh PVP
as a capping and stabilizing agent to reproduce the nanoparticles’
synthetic results (see the Experimental Section).

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Silver nitrate for analysis,
ACS, ISO (AgNO3, 99.8%), ethylene glycol (EG ≥ 99%),
and acetone were purchased from Panreac. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP,
average molecular weight: 10000 g/mol) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All materials were used as received without further purification.
Milli-Q water (MQ-H2O) was used in all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of PVP-Coated Ag NPs
Ag
NPs with a PVP surface coating are synthesized using a microwave (MW)-assisted
polyol synthesis protocol in a CEM Discover SP (with the autosampler
Explorer 12 Hybrid) at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and 300 W of power.
This MW reactor is equipped with pressurized vessels to which an active
cooling with compressed air permits to control the set reaction temperature
as well as to rapidly quench the reaction at the end of the set time
preventing Ostwald ripening. Note that since the reaction vessel remains
at room temperature during the reaction, this quenching mechanism
is very effective.

Briefly, 25 mg of PVP (2.5 μmol) is
dissolved in 4 ml of EG by continuous sonication (JP Selecta 3000683,
frequency, 40 kHz; sonication time, 5 min). Then, 4 μmol of
AgNO3 (from an aqueous solution, 250 mM) is mixed with
the above-prepared solution to give a homogeneous solution with no
color of 1 mM AgNO3. The tubes (CEM, borosilicate glass,
and silicon with septum caps) are then placed in the MW reactor and
heated under continuous agitation (Labbox, 3 × 6 mm2 cylindrical, fully encapsulated with high-grade poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
[PTFE-Teflon], and a maximum stirring speed of the CEM MW reactor).
Heating and cooling velocities of the MW reactor were the same in
all samples, with 1.1 and 0.8 °C/s, respectively. The effect
of MW time (t = 10 s, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min) and temperature
(T = 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 °C) on the resulting
silver structures was investigated. The effect of silver nitrate concentration
(0.5, 1, 10, 15, and 20 mM) was also studied. In this synthesis, PVP
is used as the capping agent to shape and stabilize the Ag NPs and
as a mild reducing agent, while EG acts as a solvent and a reducing
agent. The final solution is orange-yellow, and no precipitate is
observed, indicating that the nanoparticles are dispersed in the solution.
Ag NPs are collected by adding 30 ml of acetone in the solution and
centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 30 min to precipitate the nanoparticles
(Hettich EBA 21, type 1004, 4025 RCF). The supernatant with excess
reactants (PVP, EG, NO3–, and Ag+ ions not reduced) was discarded. The same procedure was repeated
twice and the final solid NP precipitate was dispersed in 1 mL of
MQ-H2O and kept for further characterization. All of the
above experiments were carried out in duplicate. PVP-capped Ag NPs
are stable in water. Sample colloidal stability in water was demonstrated
up to 9 months. Aggregates or precipitates were not significantly
observed (Figure S4a). In addition, TEM
analysis demonstrates their shape stability (Figure S4b–g).

Experiments to study the influence of
agitation, PVP concentration,
and initial conditions of silver nitrate were also prepared. Comprehending
all these effects allowed us to control the particle size and tuning
of Ag NPs on-demand.

This synthetic route can be scaled up by
at least a factor of 4.
To study the scalability of the protocol, both the same MW reactor
and a Microwave Advanced Flexible Synthesis Platform (flexiwave) from
Milestone at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and 500 W power were used.

We provide a recommendation regarding the use of fresh PVP as a
capping and stabilizing agent. As mentioned above, all of the experiments
were carried out in duplicate. The replicates were synthesized 4 months
apart. In these samples, the behaviors found for both the controls
and different effects were reproduced, demonstrating the robustness
of the MW-assisted synthesis. However, the resulting Ag NPs changed
the morphology and a slight decrease in the average size was observed
(Figure S5). These differences were attributed
to PVP aging since, when new PVP was bought and used, the initial
shapes were recovered. PVP polymer powder, according to the Safety
Data Sheet (SDS), is stable and can be stored under ordinary conditions
without undergoing decomposition or degradation. However, the powder
is hygroscopic, forms molecular adducts with many other substances,
and cross-links at high temperatures. This can result in a solubilizing
action in some cases or in precipitation in others (in water or alcohol).
Thus, all these potential uncontrolled changes of the PVP can affect
the nanoparticles’ synthetic results. Our final suggestion
is to buy small batches of PVP and use them for no longer than 4 months.

4.3 Material Characterization
The morphologies
and the crystalline phase of the Ag NPs were analyzed in a JEOL JEM-1210
transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 120 kV and in
a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 high-resolution transmission electron
microscope (HRTEM) operating at 200 kV. One drop of the NP dispersion
was placed in a TEM grid (Micro to Nano, EMR Carbon support film on
copper 200 square mesh). Typically, at least 500 different nanoparticles
were measured with ImageJ to depict the size histogram. The mean particle
size and standard deviation resulted from adjusting the particle size
histograms to a Gaussian distribution function. An analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test is used to successfully prove the significant differences
in the mean particle size change by increasing the time, the temperature,
and the concentration. In all cases, the P-value
determined is <0.0001. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectra were collected on a Varian Cary-5 UV–vis spectrophotometer
between 200 and 800 nm. An aliquot of the Ag NP dispersion is directly
placed to the UV–vis cuvette and the obtained spectra normalized
to the maximum absorbance value of the LSPR of the Ag NPs. Chemical
analysis of Ag was done with inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with an ICP-OES Perkin-Elmer, model Optima
4300DV. The samples were previously digested with concentrated nitric
acid (for analysis, ISO, HNO3, 65%) in an ultrasound bath.
Samples were carried out in duplicate. The reaction yield was calculated
from these results.
