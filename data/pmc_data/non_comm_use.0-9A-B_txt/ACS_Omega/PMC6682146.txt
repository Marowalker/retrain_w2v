Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia (CPVT) is
caused by mutations of cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) that impair its
characteristic ability of Ca2+-induced polymerization–depolymerization. However, stabilizing the CASQ2 polymer by pharmacological agents
to treat CPVT has not been reported so far. Here, we tested whether
small molecules can stabilize CASQ2 polymers. We synthesized 24 glycinate/alaninate/acetate
α-pyranone analogs and conducted the CASQ2 depolymerization
assay. Most of the molecules of this class of compounds inhibited
the depolymerization of the protein upon Ca2+ chelation
by ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. Structure–activity relationship
studies revealed that the compounds with the 4-fluoro-phenyl group
at the C-6 position of the pyranone ring and open-chain primary amine
at C-4 are the most active of the class. This is the first report
of an α-pyranone class of compounds with the ability to stabilize
CASQ2 polymers and opens up the possibility to target Ca2+-release disorders via modulation of CASQ2 polymerization.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Defects
in Ca2+ release by the cardiac ryanodine receptor
(RyR2) is associated with many heart diseases including catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), catecholaminergic idiopathic
ventricular fibrillation, malignant hyperthermia, and central core
disease.1−3 The first-line medications for most cardiac diseases
include β-blockers or calcium channel blockers.4 However, these medications have serious limitations including
proarrhythmic potential and drug toxicity. The newer targets for anti-arrhythmic
treatment include acting upon intracellular Ca2+ handling
in the cardiac myocyte, interference with the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II, the Na+1/Ca2+ exchanger,
RyR, and the late component of Na current (INa-Late).5 Ca2+ release from RyR2 is partly regulated by cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2),
the major Ca2+-buffering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR).6 CASQ2 binds Ca2+ with
high capacity and low affinity,7,8 which allows quick dissociation
of Ca2+ for release via RyR2, thereby facilitating repetitive
muscle contractions.9,10 CASQ2 interaction with RyR2 is
complex, and different (both direct and indirect) mechanisms were
proposed.6,11 Györke and Györke suggested
that the action of the RyR is directed by CASQ, which can sense changes
in luminal Ca2+ concentration in the range of 0.2–20
mM. Alternatively, CASQ2 might serve only as a fast source of Ca2+ ions near the RyR2 channel. In this case, CASQ2 would regulate
the Ca2+ current flowing via the RyR2 channel. They further
explained that it might be important to regulate Ca2+ release
under normal and pathological conditions.12 Moreover, Terentyev et al. indicated that CASQ2 controls the magnitude and duration of Ca2+ release23 and thereby affects
the luminal Ca2+-dependent RyR2. Approximately 15 mutations
in CASQ2 were reported to cause a unique type of arrhythmia called
CPVT. These mutations (L167H, D307H, P308L, and R33Q) affect Ca2+-induced CASQ2 polymerization that impairs RyR2-mediated
Ca2+ release in the subsequent contraction–relaxation
cycle leading to sudden cardiac death.13−21 Further, ablation of CASQ2 is known to cause CPVT in a mouse model.22 We therefore propose that targeting modulation
of CASQ2 polymerization by a small molecule could be an attractive
drug target for treating CPVT and possibly other forms of arrhythmia.23

Different classes of small molecules with
varied biological significance
were shown to bind to CASQ2 based on docking, X-ray crystallography,
and biological studies.24−26 Some of the molecules bind to
CASQ2 and cause destabilization of the polymeric state,24 while others induce polymerization.26 Anthracyclines (doxorubicin, doxorubicinol,
daunorubicin, daunorubicinol) and phenothiazines (promethazine, thioridazine,
chlorpromazine) are reported to have affinity for CASQ2, affect Ca2+-induced CASQ2 polymerization, and alter SR-mediated Ca2+ release.27,28 However, anthracyclines are known
to cause cardiotoxicity.29 It was proven
that addition of doxorubicin triggers Ca2+ release from
cardiac SR vesicles30−32 Pessah et al. reported that the anthracyclines enhanced
[3H]ryanodine binding to rat SR vesicles enriched
in RyR2 channels. They further suggested that, with the interaction
of anthraquinones, there is a receptor-mediated shift in the redox
equilibrium of allosteric thiols in RyR.33 Anthracycline–RyR2 interaction is mediated by the presence
of quinone and a side-chain carbonyl, which interacts with the cysteine
residues in the cytosolic RyR2 face.34 Further,
human carbonyl reductase induces one-electron reduction of quinone
and two-electron reduction of side-chain carbonyl, and these are accompanied
by iron and free radical reactions.35 The
effect of the anthracycline metabolite is even more pronounced than
the anthracycline itself. It decreases the extent of CASQ2 linked
with RyR2, and it also interacts directly with CASQ2 to induce structural
changes due to lower Ca2+ binding capacity.34 We aimed to design a molecule without a quinone
moiety with the ability to interact with CASQ2 that does not induce
oxidative stress forming metabolites, which could lead to toxicity.
The ester/amide group requires harsh conditions for its reduction
in comparison to aldehyde and ketone and hence is less likely to produce
alcohol metabolites to interfere with the thiol residues of RyR2.

Herein, we report synthesis of derivatives based on a new scaffold,
namely, 4,6-disubstituted-2H-pyranone-3-carbonyl-glycinate/alaninate/acetate,
earlier unknown to interfere with CASQ2 polymerization. We hypothesize
that molecules belonging to this novel class may stabilize the CASQ2
polymer in an arrhythmic condition.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The
6-aryl-4-methylthio-2H-pyranone-3-carboxylic acids
(1a–e) were synthesized from various
substituted acetophenones
or 2-acetyl furan (Scheme 1) according to our reported procedure from ketene dithioacetals
and diethyl malonate (DEM).36,37 Ethyl 6-aryl-4-(methylthio)-2-oxo-2H-pyran-3-carboxylate (1f) was formed as a
minor product during the synthesis of 1b. Generally,
in the synthesis, deprotonated DEM forms a new C–C bond with
a ketene dithioacetal upon the elimination of the SMe– group and subsequent deprotonation followed by the release of the
ethoxide anion leading to the formation of the ethyl ester derivative
of pyranone carboxylic acid, which upon hydrolysis affords the corresponding
3-carboxylic acid derivatives (1a–e) with 36–54% yields (see Figure S1). Glycine/alanine ester was coupled with 1a–e to generate 6-aryl-4-methylthio-2H-pyranone-3-carbonyl
glycinate/alaninate key intermediates (2a–e, details in the Supporting Information) in the presence of hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyl
uronium (HATU) as the coupling agent and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the base with 85–91%
yields. The reaction when performed using N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as a coupling reagent
resulted in lower yields along with additional purification steps.
The final 4,6-disubstituted-2H-pyranone-3-carbonyl-glycinates/alaninates/acetates
(3a–x, Figure 1) were obtained by nucleophilic substitution
of 2a–e/1f with appropriate
amine in ethanol. All synthesized compounds were characterized (data
in the Supporting Information) by melting
point, IR, UV, MS, and 1H/13C NMR. In addition,
one of the final compounds (3b) was analyzed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction. ORTEP diagram (Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot)
is presented in Figure 2. CCDC-150756 (The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre) contains
the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

2.2 Biological Evaluation
A Ca2+-induced aggregation
of CASQ2 followed by the ethylene glycol tetraacetic
acid (EGTA)-mediated resolubilization/depolymerization assay20 was used for evaluating the ability of 3a–x to modulate the polymeric state of
CASQ2 (Figure 3). EGTA
has much higher affinity for Ca2+ than CASQ2. Therefore,
Ca2+ chelation with EGTA compels CASQ2 polymers to release
a portion of the bound Ca2+ with or without depolymerization.
The concentrations of EGTA to resolubilize 50% of CASQ2 protein from
aggregation (i.e., EC50 of EGTA-mediated resolubilization)
in the absence and presence of any one of 3a–x at a time in a specified concentration were measured. Compounds
at concentration 1 μM or less necessitating higher concentration
of EGTA for resolubilization of CASQ2 are considered to inhibit its
depolymerization (Figure 3). Percentage inhibition of CASQ2 depolymerization by a compound
is the ratio of the percentage of CASQ2 left as polymer in its presence
to the percentage of CASQ2 left as polymer in its absence at a particular
EGTA concentration.

resolubilization/depolymerization
assay. Concentration values are scaled by row. Compound code is indicated
in the x axis. Compounds 3e, 3u, and 3v have the highest potentials (>50% at 100
nM)
to inhibit depolymerization of CASQ2.

2.3 Molecular Modeling
Blind docking
of the most active molecules 3e, 3u, and 3v to the two dimers indicated the clear preference for the
front-to-front dimer. Over 250 poses grouped into nearly 33 clusters
were generated for each structure docked into both dimers. The top
six clusters generated from docking into the front-to-front dimer
suggested its binding into the interface of the two monomers (Figure 4). Meanwhile, we
could not identify a specific preference for any binding site in the
back-to-back dimer. We therefore examined the binding site at the
interface of the front-to-front dimer in details. The CASQ2 monomer
is composed of three thioredoxin folds connected by loops. The binding
pocket is formed between the residues of the two monomers. The molecules
were found to interact with the N-terminal, the first thioredoxin
fold of the first monomer, and the third thioredoxin fold of the second
monomer (Figure 4).
The aliphatic amine forms a H-bonding interaction with His67 of one
monomer, and Ar–F is involved in electrostatic interactions
with Leu294 of the second monomer (Figure 4). It is further stabilized by the hydrophobic
interactions with several residues including Ala297, Lys301, and Tyr298
of the first and Leu65, Val64, and Glu66 of the second monomer, respectively.
The ester/amide group is projected outward from the protein without
actually participating in the binding. The binding of the molecules
provides additional arms to hold the monomers together and prevent
the Ca2+ leak in an arrhythmic condition.

with the second monomer. The molecule forms several hydrophobic interactions
with Ala297, Lys301, and Tyr298 of the first and Leu65, Val64, and
Glu66 of the second monomer holding the two monomers together. The
model was created using Maestro. The ligand is represented using ball
and stick, and the interacting residues are represented in line notation.
The protein structure is represented in ribbon.

Fifteen molecules out of 3a–x (Figure 3) were able
to inhibit
depolymerization of CASQ2 at a concentration below 10 μM and
considered active. Among them, molecules with an ability to inhibit
more than 50% CASQ2 depolymerization at 100 nM were considered highly
active. Compounds 3a–c with an unsubstituted
phenyl ring at the C-6 position were found to be inactive. It was
found that the 4-F-phenyl at the C-6 position enhances activity when
the C-4 position contains a primary amine with acyclic alkyl group. 3e, 3u, and 3v (Figure 3) were able to inhibit more
than 50% CASQ2 depolymerization at 100 nM, and 3m inhibited
more than 50% CASQ2 depolymerization at 250 nM. When we replaced 4-F-phenyl
with furan-2-yl, 4-Cl-phenyl, 4-Br-phenyl, or the primary amine at
the C-4 position, we observed a considerable decrease in activity
in the resulting compounds (Figure 3). Among the 24 molecules, only those molecules with
open-chain amine at C-4 and 4-F-phenyl at the C-6 showed the high
inhibitory effect (Figure 3). The structure–activity relationship (SAR) of the
synthesized pyranone analogs is summarized in Figure 5.

pyranone
derivatives.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have discovered the pyranone analogs as promising
new chemotypes with the ability to stabilize the CASQ2 polymer. Twenty-four
glycinate/alaninate/acetate pyranone analogs were synthesized and
evaluated for CASQ2 polymer stabilization potential. SAR studies revealed
that the 4-F-phenyl at the 6th position of the pyranone ring and open-chain
primary amine at the 4th position were the most active of the class.
Docking studies suggest that the molecules interact at the interface
of the front-to-front dimer, which is the first key step in CASQ2
polymerization and is determinant of its rate. The present work opens
an avenue for further research toward targeting CASQ2 polymerization
to treat CPVT and other forms of arrhythmia by describing a new class
of molecules and revealing the potential drug binding pocket in the
CASQ2 that stabilizes its polymer.

Section
4.1 Chemistry
General: All the reactions
were carried out in oven-dried glassware. The chemicals and solvents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Spectrochem, or Acros and were
used without any purification except THF (tetrahydrofuran), which
was dried by refluxing over sodium followed by distillation. Reactions
were monitored by TLC, which are precoated by silica gel (Kieselgel
60F 254, Merck), and the spots were detected under UV light (254 nm).
Compounds were purified by column chromatography using silica gel
(particle size 100–200 mesh). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were characterized in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 solution by using (Wormhole-vnmrs/Bruker/Jeol-Delta/Varian)
400/300 MHz spectrophotometers. Chemical shifts are reported as ppm
(δ) relative to TMS (δ 0.0) as the internal standard. 1H NMR data is recorded as follows: chemical shift [multiplicity,
coupling constant(s) J (Hz), relative integral] where
multiplicity is defined as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
q (quartet), m (multiplet), and bs (broad singlet). Mass spectra were
recorded on a 6430 Triple quardrupole mass spectrometer for ESI and
are given in m/z. FTIR spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer 1600 series FTIR spectrophotometer. UV spectra
were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 UV–visible spectrophotometer
(USA).

4.2 Depolymerization
Assay
The rat wild-type
(WT) CASQ2 was cloned into a pET21a vector (Novagen) between Nde I
and Xho I restriction sites. The protein was expressed in bacterial
cells and purified using an earlier published method.18 To a 2.5 μM CASQ2 solution in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 7.5) containing 20 mM NaCl at 25 ± 2 °C, 3a was added at specified concentration. To this solution, 10 mM CaCl2 was added to polymerize the protein. The solution was left
to stand for 1 h, thereafter it was mixed by pipetting and aliquot
of 500 μL were pipetted into new test tubes. One of these
test tubes was centrifuged at 20000g for 1 h, and
absorbance was recorded at 350 nm. The soluble fraction was estimated
for protein concentration by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. This was performed to confirm
that more than 75% of proteins were polymerized. To the polymerized
solution aliquots in several test tubes, 2–10 μL of EGTA
(0.1–0.5 M) was added and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min.
Then absorbance was recorded at 350 nm, and the percentage of protein
still polymerized in different tubes was calculated as above. The
concentration of EGTA to resolubilize 50% of CASQ2 protein from precipitation
(i.e., EC50 of EGTA-mediated resolubilization) was calculated.
EC50 of 3a at specified concentration was
compared to EC50 in sample buffer. This procedure was repeated
for the rest of the compounds (3b–x). The percentage of inhibition was calculated by taking the ratio
between the percentage left as polymer with and without the chemical
compound at a particular EGTA concentration.

4.3 Molecular
Modeling
In silico molecular
docking was performed to understand the possible binding site of our
designed molecules. CASQ2 polymers are formed via front-to-front (N-terminal)
and back-to-back (C-terminal) contacts.38 The structure for the front-to-front dimer is established; however,
not much information is available for the back-to-back dimer (C-terminal
contact points) due to the absence of a crystal structure. In order
to facilitate polymerization, it is plausible that these molecules
interact at the polymeric interface. Since there was no prior knowledge
about the binding site of the molecules, blind docking was performed
using web server Swiss Model39 with the
accurate mode. The crystal structure of the front-to-front dimer 1SJI was downloaded from
the RCSB protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/). The structure is devoid of intrinsically disordered C-terminal
residues; however, it does not make a significant contribution in
the protein folding.40 The protein structure
was prepared using the default parameters of Protein Preparation Wizard
of the Schrödinger Suite.41 As there
was no information about any conserved water molecules, the water
molecules were deleted. The structures of the most active molecules 3e, 3u, and 3v were provided after
minimization with the OPLS3e force field, run for a maximum of 25000
iterations using the MacroModel module of the Schrödinger Suite.
To examine if the molecules bind to the back-to-back interface of
the CASQ2 structure, we built the homology model of the back-to-back
dimeric CASQ2 structure. We used the sequence of 1SJI for building the
model. The 3D-homology model of the CASQ2 back-to-back dimer was built
using the Prime module of the Schrödinger Suite. Chains B and
C of the crystal structure of human CASQ1 (PDB code 3UOM) was chosen as the
template. 3UOM is the polymeric structure of CASQ, which is very likely to resemble
the CASQ2 polymeric structure. The sequence alignment shows 68% identity
and 84% positives. 3UOM is a hexamer composed of six chains A–F. The dimeric units
AB, CD, and EF are involved in the front-to-front contact, and the
dimeric units BC and DE have the back-to-back contacts. The homology
model obtained was minimized, and loops were refined using the default
parameters of Prime minimization and loop refinement. The structure
hence obtained was used for blind docking using accurate mode of Swiss
Dock. The results were analyzed using UCSF Chimera (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/). Binding mode was further analyzed using the Discovery Studio Visualizer.42
