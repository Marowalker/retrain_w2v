Introduction
Water
scarcity and aquatic pollution are the most critical issues
for modern societies. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
1.1 billion people do not have a proper access to better quality drinking
water. A 30% rise in fresh water demand is possible by 2030 if the
current projection is well matched with population growth. Approximately
80% of wastewater without prior treatment is discharged into water
resources such as groundwater and seawater. Thus, these water sources
are being polluted and are deteriorating in parallel. To overcome
these issues, water resources should be protected and seawater desalination
or water purification must be continuously performed. Membrane separation
processes have been adopted for water purification and desalination.
A smaller amount of energy is consumed during membrane separation
processes compared with thermal processes.1−3

Thin film
composite membranes are used in nanofiltration and reverse
osmosis for water purification and desalination. The fabrication methodology
and performance of TFC membranes in water desalination and purification
have been reviewed. However, the separation performance of TFC membranes
is limited due to the trade-off phenomenon in their permeability and
selectivity.4 To address this issue, effort
have been expended to design and manufacture thin film nanocomposite
(TFN) membranes by integrating nanofillers into their selective layers.
The integration of the nanofillers into the selective layer of the
membranes provides extra pathways for high mass transfer via intrinsic
nanosized pores of the nanofillers and interface voids between polyamide
(PA) chains and fillers, whereas the original molecular sieving capacity
of the membranes is maintained. Thus, high water flux TFN membranes
without alteration in their selectivities are produced.5−9 The multifunctional polyelectrolyte nanoparticles (PNPs) have also
been explored in constructing TFN membranes through interfacial polymerization.10,11 The progress made in different types of nanofiller-based hybrid
or composite membranes has been addressed in several reviews on water
treatment.1,3 However, it is noticed that recent developments
in the fabrication of TFN membranes using nanofillers and PNPs for
water treatment applications have not been reviewed in a systematic
way. Therefore, this review summarizes the recent progresses made
in the fabrication of TFN membranes for water purification and desalination.
Challenges encountered during the manufacturing of TFN membranes using
the rationalized nanofillers and improvement in separation performance
are summarized, which would motivate more exciting developments in
the future.

Fabrication of Thin Film Nanocomposite Membranes
Thin
film nanocomposite membranes have been fabricated using the
rationalized nanofillers and multifunctional PNPs through interfacial
polymerization. The recent trends in the development of the rational
fabrication of TFN membranes from 2011 to 2019 and the overall objectives
of the review are presented in Figure 1. It can be seen that the number of publications on
the fabrication of TFN membranes using the different nanofillers are
increasing gradually.

Carbon
Nanotube-Derived TFN Membranes
Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) have been applied in the fabrication of TFN membranes via interfacial
polymerization (IP).12−15 The water permeability and the separation performance of the membranes
were improved after incorporating the optimum amount of CNTs into
their selective layers. High-water permeability was achieved due to
the presence of hydrophobic channels in CNTs and the creation of interfacial
voids between the polymer chains of the selective layers and CNTs
in the membrane matrix.12,13 The functionalized
MWCNTs were utilized in fabricating TFN membranes. The surface morphology,
thickness, and hydrophilicity of the membranes were altered after
incorporating the functionalized MWCNTs. The nodular surface morphologies
were observed for the membranes containing the functionalized MWCNTs.
The membrane comprising hydroxylated MWCNTs (MWCNTs-OH) had the highest
water flux.14 However, the rejection capabilities
of CNT-loaded TFN membranes were reduced for a high amount of CNTs
into the selective layers due to poor dispersion in the aqueous phase
and defect creation through the agglomeration of CNTs.12 To overcome these difficulties, multifunctional
polymer chains were grafted onto CNTs and then used as nanofillers
in the fabrication of TFN membranes.15,16 Shen et al.
performed a microemulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate in
the presence of acid-modified MWCNTs for grafting poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) chains onto the MWCNTs. Thin film nanocomposite membranes with
varied amount of PMMA–MWCNTs were prepared by IP using trimesoyl
chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) monomers. The water permeability
and salt removal efficiency were significantly improved after adding
different amount of PMMA-MWCNTs to the selective layers.16 Polydopamine (PDA)-coated MWCNTs (PDA-MWCNTs)
were inserted into the PA selective layer to fabricate positively
charged TFN membranes via IP between polyethylenimine (PEI) and TMC.
A schematic illustration of the fabrication of positively charged
TFN membranes is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Fabrication of the PEI/PDA-MWCNTs TFN membrane from PDA-coated
MWCNTs, PEI, and TMC via interfacial polymerization.17 (Reproduced with permission from ref (17). Copyright 2015, American
Chemical Society.)

A polysulfone (PSF) support
membrane was immersed in an aqueous
solution of PEI and PDA-MWCNTs for 2 min. Thereafter, the remaining
aqueous solution was removed from the membrane surface. Furthermore,
an organic solution of trimesoyl chloride (TMC) in hexane was poured
onto the surface of the support membrane saturated with PEI/PDA-MWCNTs
for a minute to form a PA-selective layer after IP. The extra TMC
solution was then decanted, and the resulting TFN membrane was thermally
treated at ambient temperature for 15 min. Polydopamine-coated MWCNTs
were well dispersed in the selective layer of TFN membranes owing
to the enhanced compatibility of PDA-MWCNTs with PA matrixes through
strong covalent interactions between PEI and PDA-MWCNTs. A similar
protocol was explored in the fabrication of TFN membranes with different
quantities of PDA-MWCNTs.17 Zwitterionic
polymer chain-modified MWCNTs (ZPMWCNTs) were explored in the fabrication
of TFN membranes. Zwitterionic polymer chain-modified MWCNTs facilitated
the formation of the defect-free uniform selective layer on the TFN
membranes as the dispersion of ZPMWCNTs in an aqueous solution of
PIP was significantly upgraded. An almost 31% enhancement in water
permeability was observed without sacrificing the selectivity of the
TFN membrane containing 0.01% ZPMWCNTs.18 Thus, the fabrication of defect-free high-performance TFN membranes
was achievable using the polymer-chain-grafted CNTs.

Graphene Oxide
and Its Nanocomposite-Assisted TFN Membranes
Graphene oxide
(GO) has received increasing attention with respect
to the fabrication of TFN membranes because of its unique properties
such as its atomic thickness and the existence of oxygen functional
groups. The water permeability and rejection efficiency of TFN membranes
are improved after the addition of GO to the PA selective layer. Graphene
oxide nanosheets at high concentration cannot be dispersed homogeneously
in the selective layer of TFN membranes; therefore, the performance
of GO-enabled TFN membranes is ultimately hampered.3,19 To
overcome these problems, the functionalized GO nanosheets have been
prepared through chemical modifications and applied in the fabrication
of TFN membranes.20−22 Kang et al. implanted sulfonated GO (SGO) nanosheets
into the PA layer to make TFN membranes with different amounts of
SGO. Membrane properties such as the hydrophilicity, surface roughness,
charge density, pure water permeability, and antifouling capability
were dependent on the concentration of SGO nanosheets. The surface
roughness of the membranes was increased after the addition of a large
quantity of SGO. At 0.3 wt % loading of SGO, the water permeability
of the TFN-0.3 membrane improved to 87.3%, and this membrane was capable
of removing more than 95% of MgSO4 from its solution.21 Ma et al. synthesized zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine
methacrylate) (PSBMA) polymer chain-functionalized GO (PSBMA-GO) and
incorporated it into the PA selective layer of the membranes to improve
their water permeability, separation performance, and fouling resistance.
The surface hydrophilicity significantly improved with the incorporation
of PSBMA-GO. An approximately 2-fold increase in water permeability
with no significant change in the salt rejection capacity was achieved
after the incorporation of the 0.3 wt % PSBMA-GO nanohybrid. The incorporation
of PSBMA-GO into the selective layer was efficient for improving the
water permeability and fouling resistance of TFN membranes.21 Graphene oxide-derived nanocomposites such as
reduced graphene oxide (rGO)@TiO2@Ag and GO-Ag-MOF have
been applied in the fabrication of TFN membranes.23,24 rGO@TiO2@Ag was incorporated into the PA layer to fabricate
multifunctional TFN membranes via IP on the robust hollow fiber substrate
using an aqueous solution of phenylenediamine with rGO@TiO2@Ag and an organic solution of TMC in hexane. The rGO@TiO2@Ag nanocomposite was accountable in varying the surface texture
and topography of the membranes. In addition, the water permeability
was enhanced by incorporating a specific amount of the rGO@TiO2@Ag nanocomposite because water permeation was facilitated
by the formation of additional water pathways at the interface of
rGO@TiO2@Ag and the PA polymer matrix.23 Thus, the fabrication of antibiofouling and high-performance
TFN membranes without sacrificing their rejection efficiencies is
attainable using the functionalized GO and its nanocomposites.

Carbon
Quantum Dot TFN Membranes
Carbon quantum dots
(CQDs) have attracted a tremendous amount of attention in membrane
technology for their applications in separation processes. Carbon
quantum dots have been considered to be promising nanofillers for
the fabrication of TFN membranes because of their ultrasmall size,
high affinity for the PA matrix, superior hydrophilicity, and excellent
dispersion in aqueous solutions of monomer used in IP. Carbon quantum
dots disperse well in aqueous solutions and subsequently take part
in IP to produce TFN membranes. Carbon quantum dot-derived TFN membranes
are proficient at outperforming pristine membranes even at a small
loading of CQDs. The hydrophilicity, water permeability, rejection
rate, and antibiofouling properties depend on the loading amount of
CQDs in TFN membranes.25 Li et al. reported
that the surface morphology of TFN membranes was transformed from
a leaflike structure to a ridge-and-valley structure with the incorporation
of hydrophilic CQDs in the PA layer, and the resulting membranes became
more hydrophilic.26 Carbon quantum dots
with carboxyl, amine, and sulfonic acid groups were synthesized and
used in the production of new types of TFN membranes through IP using
an aqueous solution of PIP, functionalized CQDs, and an organic solution
of TMC. The chemical structure of the PA layer was influenced by the
functional moieties (−COOH, −NH2, and −SO3H) presented in CQDs. The sulfonic acid group-functionalized
CQDs (SCQDs) and PA macromolecular chains in the selective layers
of the membranes were arranged in a systematic mode. As a result,
the negatively charged and loose PA layer was formed due to the presence
of sulfonic acid (−SO3H) groups in SCQDs. More transport
pathways for water molecule permeation were formed in TFN membranes
comprising SCQD. The water permeability and separation performance
were tunable with the number of functionalized CQDs.27 Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) (a new type of CQDs)
containing TFN membranes were fabricated via in situ polymerization
using an aqueous solution of tannic acid–GOQDs–TMC and
an organic solution of isophorone diisocyanate in hexane. The water
permeability was increased with the loading amount of GOQDs in the
PA layer of the membranes. The short flow paths in GOQDs played a
significant role in improving the water permeation of the membranes.28 Yu et al., embedded a Ag-GOQDs nanohybrid into
the PA-selective layer to manufacture antibacterial TFN membranes.
The water permeability was highly dependent on the loading concentration
of Ag-GOQDs into the selective layer of the membranes. An approximately
44.3% improvement in water permeability was observed, whereas the
salt removal efficiency did not deteriorate with the incorporation
of Ag-GOQDs. Ag-GOQD-based TFN membranes had bacterial resistance
against E. coli and S. aureus. The
incorporation of Ag-GOQD into the TFN membranes provided an efficient
approach in controlling the organic fouling and biofouling during
filtration at high feed pressure in nanofiltration (NF) and reverse
osmosis (RO) processes. Subsequently, the sustainability of water
reclamation and the desalination performance of the membranes were
improved.29 The utmost performance of TFN
membranes can be alleviated through a suitable functionalization of
CQDs and loading concentration optimization into the PA layer.

Metal–Organic
Framework-Mediated TFN Membranes
Metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) have received substantial
attention in membrane separation technology. The highly porous structure
and tunable chemical functionality of MOFs make them promising candidates
for use in fabricating different types of membranes for water treatment.
To be specific, MOFs have been incorporated into the PA-selective
layer of TFN membranes to improve the water permeability and high-salt
removal efficiency.30,31 However, the separation performance
of TFN membranes manufactured from MOFs is hampered by the agglomeration
of MOF nanoparticles and the formation of nonselective defects in
the interphase boundaries of PA-selective layers. In addition, expensive
MOFs are unavoidably wasted during IP. Therefore, these major issues
(an agglomeration of MOF nanoparticles, interphasial defects, and
the wasting of MOFs) should be resolved to develop high-performance
TFN membranes using MOFs. To overcome the major issues encountered
in the fabrication of MOF-enabled TFN membranes, an ultrathin layer
of MOF nanoparticles was predeposited on the top surface of the membrane
support with the help of a spray-assisted deposition method, a PDA
buffering layer with controlled loading of UiO-66-NH2 and
evaporation-controlled nanofiller positioning. Thereafter, IP was
performed to fabricate defect-free high-performance TFN membranes.
It should be noted that a minute quantity of MOFs was required to
develop TFN membranes using the above-mentioned approaches compared
to conventional IP in the presence of MOF nanoparticles.32−34 Zhang et al. first deposited PDA on the surface of a membrane support
as a buffering layer to fabricate continuous, well-intergrown, and
stable MOF/UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticle-integrated TFN membranes.
A polydopamine layer facilitated in the close fixing of the MOF particle
positions on the surface of the membrane support and UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles were fixed covalently onto the surface of a
membrane support through Michael addition or Schiff base reaction.
The chances of leaching UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles during
the draining of a PIP aqueous solution were significantly reduced.
Only 0.01 wt % UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles with respect to
the v % of the PIP aqueous solution was adequate to acquire defect-free
TFN membranes with dense PA-selective layers. UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticle-integrated TFN membranes displayed extremely high water
permeability and very competitive salt rejection efficiency.33 The ZIF-8 nanofiller was implanted into PA layers
by an evaporation-controlled filler positioning (EFP) method and IP
using an aqueous solution of m-phenylenediamine (MPD),
a suspension of ZIF-8 in hexane, and an organic solution of TMC in
hexane. The controlled position of ZIF-8 in PA layers increased the
water permeability of the resulting membranes to 220% without a loss
of rejection efficiency.34

Yang et
al. reported self-sealed PA-zinc imidazole framework (ZIF) TFN membranes
with nanoscale turing-type surface morphology. The fabrication protocol
for the new type of TFN membrane is presented in Figure 3. Initially, the PSF membrane
support was saturated with a zinc nitrate solution of a defined concentration
to form a PSF-Zn membrane. A polysulfone-Zn membrane was then exposed
to PIP solution to producing the PSF-Zn(II)-PIP membrane. An organic
solution of TMC in hexane further poured onto the surface of the PSF-Zn(II)-PIP
membrane and left for some time interval. The fabricated membrane
was heated at ambient temperature to produce the TFC-Zn(II) membrane,
which was immersed in a mixture of 2-imidazole and methanol for the
self-sealing of the selective layer. Finally, ZIF-8 incorporated TFN
membrane with turing type morphology was formed. A similar protocol
was explored in fabricating other membranes comprising different amount
of ZIF-8. Compared with pristine TFC membrane, the water permeability
of TFN membrane containing minute amount of ZIF-8 (2 mmol m–2) was almost 400% higher. This could be attributed to the existence
of high water permeating turing-type PA networks on the membrane surface
and the existence of multiple internal water-permeating channels inside
the ZIF-8 nanoparticles.35 Thus, the high-performance
TFN membranes for water desalination and purification can be built
using a different metal salt solution by following the above-mentioned
protocol.

Multifunctional Polyelectrolyte Nanoparticle-Mediated TFN Membranes
Recently, polyelectrolyte nanoparticles (PNPs) as organic fillers
have been incorporated in the construction of water channels in PA-selective
layers of TFN membranes. It is reported that the separation performance
and the fouling resistance of the membranes were greatly improved
after introducing PNPs.36−38 PNPs are well-dispersed without
agglomeration into the matrix of the PA-selective layer of the membranes
owing to their superior compatibility with the PA layer. Moreover,
the water channels throughout the matrix of PA layers are constructed
through the precise control of the functional groups’ content
and degree of ionic cross-linking of PNPs. The interfacial channels
between PNPs and the PA layer matrix assist in water molecule transport
at a high rate whereas the highly efficient separation of various
ions is maintained.36,37 Ji et al. synthesized zwitterionic
nanogel (ZNG) particles through a surfactant-free emulsion polymerization
using DMAPS and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate. The synthesized ZNG particles
were used as an organic filler in making TFN membranes with controlled
water channels. ZNGs-integrated TFN membranes were fabricated on the
PSF membrane support via IP using an aqueous solution of PIP with
ZNGs particles and an organic solution of TMC in hexane (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Schematic presentation
for synthesizing ZNGs (top panel) and ZNG
thin-film nanocomposite membranes (ZNGTFNMs, bottom panel).36 (Reproduced with permission from ref (36). Copyright 2018, Elsevier.)

The membrane support fixed on a glass plate was
initially immersed
in an aqueous solution of PIP (0.35%, w/v) with a certain quantity
of ZNG particles and left for a specific time. Then, the superfluous
aqueous solution was decanted from the surface of the membrane support.
Thereafter, the aqueous solution-saturated membrane support was kept
in an organic solution of TMC (0.20% w/v) in hexane. The excess organic
solution was discarded, and the resulting membrane was dried in an
oven at ambient temperature to complete the polymerization and acquire
a TFN membrane with a ZNG particle-loaded PA-selective layer. The
produced membrane was washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove
chemical residues and solvents. The best separation performance was
attained for TFN membranes comprising 0.035% (w/v) ZNGs particles
as the preferential flow pathways for water molecule transport were
provided by the existing nanoscale pores in the PA-selective layer.
Thus, the development of a new type of TFN membrane with fine permselective
microstructures without phase separation was possible using ZNGs particles
as organic fillers during IP.36 A facile
and versatile strategy was proposed for fabricating TFN membranes
with in situ polydopamine-piperazine (PDP) nanoparticles. Dopamine
was added to an aqueous solution of PIP to form PDP nanoparticles
that were dispersed homogeneously in an aqueous solution. The well-dispersed
PDP nanoparticles were reacted promptly with organic solution containing
TMC. As a result, PDP nanoparticles were reinforced in the selective
PA layer and the porous support. The fouling resistance of the membranes
against bovine serum albumin was improved by incorporating hydrophilic
bioinspired PDP nanoparticles.37 Zhang
et al. prepared TFN membranes from PIP with TMC in the presence of
PDA-poly(ethylene glycol) (PDA-PEG) nanocapsules. A defect-free PA
separation layer was obtained for the membranes due to better miscibility
of PDA-PEG nanocapsules with the matrix of the PA layer. The inner
cavities of the nanocapsules played a significant role in additional
water permeation through the membranes.38 Thin film nanocomposite membranes with controlled nanovoids in the
PA layers were fabricated using hollow zwitterionic nanocapsules (HZNCs)
by performing IP. The internal free volume, the water permeability,
and the fouling resistance capacity of the membranes were enlarged
after embedding HZNCs into PA-selective layers. The water permeability
of the membrane comprising 19 wt % HZNCs was found to be 70% greater
with reference to the control TFC membrane. The rejection efficiency
of the resulting membrane was not altered for multivalent ions. The
separation performance of HZNC-mediated TFN membranes can be tuned
by regulating the size and amount of the nanovoid free volume and
the shell structure of HZNCs for practical applications.39

Water Purification and Desalination Applications
The
nanofiller-assisted TFN membranes have been applied in water desalination
and the removal of metal ions or dyes from a contaminated aqueous
solution for water purification. (Figure 5). The water permeability and salt rejection
efficiency of the TFN membranes are highly dependent on the types
of nanofillers and polyelectrolyte-based PNP fillers. TFN membranes
derived from functionalized CNTs and organic PNP fillers have the
highest permeability without sacrificing their salt rejection efficiencies.

Figure 5 Comparisons
of the water permeability and salt rejection efficiency
of TFN membranes derived from different nanofillers and PNPs.

The membranes fabricated from zwitterionic polymer
chain-grafted
MWCNT (ZPCNT) via interfacial polymerization were applied in the separation
of a solution of two typical inorganic salts (MgSO4 and
NaCl) with the help of two-stage NF. The selectivity of the membranes
for MgSO4 and NaCl depends on the feed concentration of
salts in their solution. The MgSO4/NaCl selectivities for
ZPCNT-embedded TFN membranes were 2 to 3 times higher than for pristine
TFC membranes at all feed concentrations in the range from 1 to 10
g L–1. The ZPCNT-TFN membranes were suitable for
the practical fractionation of salts from simulated brackish water.18 The separation performance of SGO nanosheet-incorporated
TFN (SGO-TFN) membranes was tested in the desalination of a single
salt (NaCl, Na2SO4, or MgSO4) solution
of 2500 mg L–1 concentration through NF at 6 bar
feed pressure. Sulfonated GO nanosheet-incorporated TFN membranes
were efficient in the removal of Na2SO4 and
MgSO4 (more than 95% from aqueous salt solutions) under
the optimized experimental parameters. The fabricated membrane had
a moderate NaCl removal efficiency (75.3%) from aqueous solution.22 The functionalized CQD-assisted TFN membranes
were utilized in the NF of Na2SO4, MgSO4, MgCl2, and NaCl distinct solutions to evaluate
their separation performance. The size sieving and Donnan exclusion
were accountable for salt removal from aqueous solution. The maximum
retention by the membranes was attained for Na2SO4 and MgSO4. Moreover, the salt retention capability of
the membranes depended on the functional moieties presented in CQDs.
The membrane containing aminated CQDs (CQDs-NH2) displayed
an improvement in the retention of MgCl2 or NaCl.27 The GOQD-loaded TFN membranes were explored
for water desalination of 2 g L–1 NaCl solution
at 16 bar feed pressure. The membrane with a minute quantity of GOQDs
(<5 mg) was competent in the removal of >98% NaCl from the aqueous
solution.40 The separation performance
of self-sealed ZIF-8-TFN membranes was tested in the desalination
of a 1 g L–1 Na2SO4 solution.
More than 90% of Na2SO4 was rejected by the
selective layers of membranes comprising different quantities of ZIF-8.
The high rejection for Na2SO4 was achieved due
to the self-sealing of almost all larger nanopores without creating
extra interphasal defects after the completion of the counterdiffusion
self-sealing reaction process.35 The water
desalination performance of HZNCs containing TFN membranes was assessed
by filtering an individual salt (NaCl, Na2SO4, or MgSO4) solution. The water desalination performance
of the respective membranes was tunable with the loading amount of
HZNCs in the PA-selective layer. The rejection of Na2SO4 was increased with the loading amount of HZNCs, and the maximum
rejection (94.5% of Na2SO4) was obtained for
the membrane containing 19.1 wt % HZNCs.39 The separation performance of ZNG particle-mediated TFN (ZNG-TFN)
membranes was investigated using 1 g L–1 aqueous
solution of salts (NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and MgSO4). The rejection efficiency of the membranes
was found to be high for sulfate salts (Na2SO4 and MgSO4) compared to that for chloride salts (MgCl2 and NaCl) under similar experimental conditions owing to
the weak electrostatic attraction of sodium ions with membranes other
than that of magnesium ions, which resulted in the highest rejection
capability of the membranes for Na2SO4. The
rejection efficiency was maintained during the long-term filtration
of Na2SO4 solution using the manufactured TFN
membranes. The rejection efficiency was varied with the feed concentration
of Na2SO4 solution. A slight decline in salt
rejection was observed with the increasing concentration of Na2SO4 solution. Overall, the fabricated membranes
had superior separation performance during the NF of salt solutions
at constant feed pressure and different feed concentrations.36 Multifunctional TFN (MTFN) membrane-incorporated
rGO@TiO2@Ag nanocomposites were used in high-pressure crossflow
filtration for the decontamination of rose bengal (RB) and bromothymol
blue (BTB) from synthesis solutions. Approximately 98% of RB and 95%
of BTB were rejected by the MTFN enriched with 0.2 wt % rGO@TiO2@Ag. Thus, the fabricated membranes can be utilized in the
separation and removal of other types of water-soluble dyes from solutions
and contaminated wastewater.29 The NF performance
of TA–GOQD–TFN membranes was systematically inspected
by passing an aqueous solution of negatively charged dyes [Congo red
(CR), methyl orange (MO), and methyl blue (MB)] and a positively charged
dye [methylene blue (MEB) dye] at 2 bar feed pressure. The rejection
efficiency of the TA–GOQD–TFN membrane depended on the
molecular weights of dyes and their characteristics. The membranes
had a higher rejection for MB than for MO due to the high molecular
weight of MB. In addition, the rejection rate of the membrane for
CR (99.8%) was greater than that of MB (98.1%). Thus, the efficient
removal of negatively charged dyes from the contaminated aqueous solution
was possible using the TA–GOQD–TFN membranes at low
feed pressure.28

Conclusions and
Future Perspectives
In recent years, progress has been made
in the fabrication and
development of high-performance TFN membranes using the functionalized
fillers derived from GO, CNT, TiO2, Ag-TiO2,
MOFs, and organic fillers for water purification and desalination
applications through the exploitation of membrane separation process
such as NF, UF, and RO. Several functionalized nanofillers with different
functional moieties (−NH2, COOH, and zwitterionic)
are synthesized first via chemical modifications and controlled polymerization
reactions. The synthesized nanofillers are then utilized in the fabrication
of TFN membranes through performing IP between aqueous-solution-confined
nanofillers and an organic solution of the monomers in nonpolar solvents.
The water purification and desalination performance depend on the
types of functionalized nanofillers and the loading quantity into
the PA-selective layers of the TFN membranes. The water permeabilities
are improved without an alternation in selectivity after implanting
a small amount of the functionalized nanofillers. However, an agglomeration
of the nanofillers in the selective layers matrix of the membranes
at high loading concentration is one of the main hurdles in manufacturing
TFN membranes on a large scale and their applications in water desalination
and purification. Therefore, effort should be rendered in avoiding
the agglomeration of the functionalized nanofillers in the selective
layers at high loading amounts by designing new types of functionalized
nanofillers that are more compatible with the selective layers of
the membranes. In some cases, the functionalized nanofillers are initially
positioned on the top surface of the membrane supports with help of
an intermediate layer of bioinspired polymers such as PDA through
vacuum filtration and evaporation-controlled nanofiller positioning
(EFP) methodology. In the above-mentioned methods, a minute quantity
of the functionalized nanofillers is sufficient for constructing the
defect-free high-performance TFN membranes with efficient salt removal
capability. In addition, the chance of leaching of expensive nanofillers
during the decantation of a monomer aqueous solution is neglected.
Moreover, the fabrication of TFN membranes of high-water permeability
and selectivity is achievable using rationally designed organic fillers
because the inner cavities of the incorporated organic fillers act
as additional water transport pathways. In the future, more efforts
should be focused on the fabrication of high-performance TFN membranes
by either the predisposition of new types of functionalized nanofillers
with the help of bioinspired polymers or the functionalized organic
fillers compatible with selective layers of the respective membranes.
The design and development of TFN membranes from the functionalized
nanofillers or organic fillers can be an interesting area of scientific
or industrial research for those researchers working in the separation
and removal of personal care products from wastewater and aqueous
solutions at low operation costs.
