Due to the globally existed and economically
motivated adulteration
including mislabeling and/or blending, fast wine characterization
is important in wine industry. Herein, we developed an electrostatic
spray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESTASI-MS)-based method to distinguish
wines. Wine samples were directly analyzed by ESTASI-MS without any
pretreatment. Microdroplets of wine were deposited on a plastic plate
for analysis. The collection of each mass spectrometric datum can
be accomplished in 1–2 min without any need of pretreatment
to the sample, followed by principle component analysis to discriminate
wines with different labels and vintages. Long-term storage of wine
was simulated and characterized by utilizing the method. High-performance
liquid chromatography-MS was further applied to identify the distinctive
compounds in wines to indicate their difference. We found that the
method can offer a strategy for quick wine analysis, which is of practical
value in wine industry for wine classification and aging control.

1 Introduction
Wine,
a type of alcoholic beverage made from grapes, is among the
most popular drinks in the world. The wine consumption worldwide in
2016 was estimated to reach 242 million hectoliters.1 Due to the high profit and huge market, wine fraud exists
in wine market, such as wine adulteration and/or mislabeling the origin
and/or quality of wines, which may bring enormous problem to the wine
market and possibly create serious threats to the health of wine consumers.
Wine identification is of great importance for consumers’ finance
and safety concerns.

The quality of wine is commonly discerned
by color, flavor profile,
degree of sweetness, and dryness. Judgment of wines’ quality
traditionally considers the combined opinion from a group of experienced
palates (also known as wine experts) for several aspects, e.g., complexity,
aftertaste, etc. Nevertheless, judgment made by people can be emotional
and subjective, which may not be considered as a systematic method
of choice for product quality control. It is highly desirable to study
wine from molecule level to establish an evaluation method.

All wines can vest in five fundamental groups, including red wine,
white wine, rosé wine, sparkling wine, and fortified wine.
Within each group, there are hundreds of different grape varieties
and also different vinification styles. It has been reported that
there are acetaldehyde, glycerol, alcohols, sorbitol, mannitol, sulfites,
acid, amino acid, esters, minerals, phenols, sugar, etc. in red wine.2 It is a huge project to systematically study
the molecular components of different wines. Thus it is practically
important to develop approaches with minimal time consumption and
suitable to identify ambiguous wines.

Wine has been studied
using instrument techniques such as high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), HPLC-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD),
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectroscopy, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry,
and emission–excitation fluorescence spectroscopy.3 Among various analytical methods, mass spectrometry
(MS) shows distinctive advantages in wine analysis because of its
outstanding ability of molecule identification, high sensitivity,
high throughput, and high resolving power, especially in combination
with chromatographic techniques.4 Gas chromatography
(GC)-MS has been widely used to analyze volatile compounds in wines,5 while liquid chromatography (LC)-MS has been
used to study nonvolatile ones.6 However,
sample pretreatment, choice of columns, optimization of experimental
conditions, and data interpretation make GC-MS- and LC-MS-based wine
analysis approaches relatively complex.7 It is desirable to develop fast and facile strategies for wine analysis,
with the purpose of quality control and identification of adulterate
and/or mislabeled products in wine market, by skipping or greatly
simplifying pretreatment procedures.8

Ambient ionization techniques have been well developed during the
last years for fast analysis by MS. The techniques normally hold the
characteristics of direct ionization from original sample with minimal
pretreatment, ionization under ambient condition, and little effect
on the sample during ionization.9 Yong
et al. proposed an analytical method based on ambient MS for direct
and rapid analysis of pesticides in wine using the direct analysis
in real-time (DART) MS technique.10 By
virtue of adding an isotope-labeled internal standard, Di Donna et
al. reported paper spray ionization MS for rapid quantification of
resveratrol in red wine, which is a phenolic compound beneficial for
health by scavenging reactive oxygen species.11 In additional to DART ion source and paper spray ionization, common
ambient ionization techniques also include desorption electrospray
ionization12 and electrostatic spray ionization
(ESTASI).13 The ESTASI method was developed
by Girault’s group in 2012 that can in situ generate molecular
ions from untreated samples on an insulating surface.14 ESTASI-MS has been employed for many applications like
perfume fingerprinting,14 enzyme assay
screening,15 and caffeine analysis in drinks.16

The present research aims at developing
a fast and selective method
for wine identification by ESTASI-MS. To explore the potential of
ESTASI-MS for direct wine identification, red wines from different
producers and regions were analyzed without any pretreatment. MS data
were obtained using ESTASI in combination with a linear ion trap mass
spectrometer (Thermo LTQ) directly from 2 μL of original wine
samples, and then subjected to principal component analysis (PCA).
The whole experimental procedure took only 1–2 min for each
measurement without any sample pretreatment. It was found that different
wines could be well differentiated using the method. The method can
also well supervise wines stored under room temperature for a period
of time. Peaks from the ESTASI-MS data that held large variable importance
for the projection (VIP) values could be figured out for further HPLC-MS
analysis of the components significantly different among different
wines. The results show that the developed fast analysis method is
promising to identify wines between labels that may show valuable
applications in the wine industry.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Direct Wine Analysis by
ESTASI-MS
Wine samples were analyzed by ESTASI-MS without
any pretreatment.
As shown in Scheme 1, 2 μL of original wine sample was deposited to a polyimide
(PI) plate. Components inside the sample were ionized by ESTASI, and
the generated ions were analyzed by mass spectrometry followed by
multivariable statistical analysis for identification.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Illustration of the Electrostatic Spray Ionization-Mass
Spectrometry (ESTASI-MS)-Based Wine Identification
Two microliters of wine sample
was taken (a) and deposited on a polyimide (PI) target plate for MS
analysis (b). The wine sample was ionized by ESTASI, and the detected
MS data were processed by principle component analysis (PCA) to assist
the classification of wines with different labels.

As listed in Table 1, five randomly chosen wines with different labels were analyzed.
The obtained representative mass spectra for the samples are shown
in Figure 1. Control
experiment was performed when only water was analyzed. As shown in Figure 1, the peaks with
mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 74,
195, 277, 279, 294, etc. were observed in the control experiment,
which can be ascribed to the impurities from the ambient air, the
PI plate, and/or the instrument itself. Obviously, the other peaks,
e.g., with m/z at 119, 129, 136,
147, 175, 327, etc., in Figure 1 were from the wine samples.

deionized water as analyst. The main peaks in the mass spectra were
labeled with their corresponding m/z values. More information on the analyzed wine can refer to Table 1.

2.2 Wine Classification by ESTASI-MS Data
To verify the present strategy for wine classification, ESTASI-MS
data of five wines were analyzed by PCA. For each type of wine, 18
measurements were performed by ESTASI-MS. From 2 μL of the wine
sample, signal from ESTASI-MS could last around 1 min until complete
consumption of the sample by ionization and evaporation. Averaged
signal from 1 min was processed by a free R package, MALDIquant,17 for smoothing, baseline correction, peak detection,
peak alignment, and peak binning, to finally output a data set including
aligned m/z and intensity. The peak
intensity should be normalized to quantitatively compare the relative
abundance of various compounds from different samples. In metabolomics,
internal standard calibration and total area normalization are two
common methods.18 Herein, total area normalization
was adopted to develop a convenient approach, namely, the normalized
intensity of each peak was its peak area divided by the total peak
area of the corresponding mass spectrum.

As shown in Figure 2, the plot of PCA
scores indicates that four of the five analyzed wines can be distinctly
separated into four units. The total variance of the data explained
by two principal components (PCs) is 54.9% (31.4% from PC1 and 23.5%
from PC2). The color-covered area displays 95% of confidence region.
It can be observed that overlap exists for wines A1 and F on the PCA
plots, which may be because an identical type of grape was used to
produce these two wines, i.e., Cabernet Sauvignon, as listed in Table 1. The results in Figure 2b show that when
analyzing the mass spectral data sets by partial least-squares discriminant
analysis (PLS-DA), these two wines can be clearly discriminated in
the 95% confidence level. Thus, PLS-DA modeling, which is a supervised
method, is more powerful to discriminate two groups of data sets due
to its regression algorithm.19 Based on
the results, it is promising to build a spectral library for wine
authentication.

from partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for the

from the five different wines. Please see Table 1 for more information on the analyzed wines.

To further demonstrate the reliability
of the method, we conducted
ESTASI-MS analysis on the same five wine brands but from different
vintages. The information on the wine sample is listed in Table S1. Three bottles of each brand of wine
were analyzed, and at least nine mass spectra were collected from
nine times of independent sample injection to the ESTASI-MS for each
bottle. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S1, wine samples from different bottles but with the same brand
and vintage cannot be distinguished by the PCA plots. When all of
the five brands were plotted together with three bottles for each
brand, similar results to Figure 2 were observed, as shown in Supporting Information Figure S2, where the five different brands can
be well distinguished, demonstrating the good reproducibility of the
method. We have further studied the matrix effects from wine samples
that may interfere the MS analysis.20,21 A group of
selected compounds, including phenacetin, caffeine, and dextromethorphan,
were spiked into the wine samples with codes A2, AG, and F, as explained
in Table S1, and analyzed by ESTASI-MS.
As shown in Figure S3, the analyzed wines
showed similar matrix effects to the detection of the spiked compounds.

2.3 Identification of Distinctive Compounds in
Wines
PCA can discover similarities and differences between
wine samples and find the specific components that lead to the differences
among a set of mass spectral data of wines. The plot of loadings of
PCA associated with Figure 2a shows the distribution of the variable mass spectral signals
(labeled with m/z values in the
figure), as shown in Figure 2c. In the loadings plot, the discrete dots were concerned
rather than the gather dots. The plot of VIP scores was obtained from
PLS-DA. High VIP scores usually indicate the significance of the corresponding
mass spectrometric signals (labeled with m/z values on the figure) on the separation of different samples.
A total of 10 MS signals with largest VIP are listed in Figure 2d.

The compounds associated
with the MS signals with high VIP scores were further characterized
by HPLC-MS/MS. MasterView software was used for qualitative analysis
according to the MS and MS/MS information of the corresponding compounds.
The ions and corresponding identified distinctive compounds in the
wines are listed in Table 2. These compounds are significantly different in amounts among
the wines, as shown by the color blocks in Figure 2d. The approach developed here shows that
it is feasible to differentiate wines by ESTASI-MS with the assistance
of PCA and to quickly profile the main MS signals for further identification
of the distinctive compounds in the wines by HPLC-MS/MS.

Compounds in Wine by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem

2.4 Quality Control during Wine Storage
Quality control of wine during storage is an important concern for
flavor and aroma. The aging of wine is necessary and can potentially
improve the quality of wine. However, when wine is bottled, too long
storage can lead to decrease of wine quality due to oxidation. Herein,
ESTASI-MS was used to follow the change of wines during storage, which
can be used to guide the consumption of wines before their quality
is getting questionable. During the experiments, bottle-packed wines
were opened, sealed with their original corks or caps, and stored
in ambient condition. The introduction of air can fasten oxidation
of wines, thereby to simulate in a short time the long-term storage
of bottled-wines in a sealed status. ESTASI-MS data were collected
from three types of wines after different periods of storage. From
the PCA results of the MS data shown in Figure 3, little change occurred within 24 h of storage,
as indicated by the overlapping of the clustering units in the PCA
plots. Significant differences were observed after 3 days of storage,
indicating the potential content changes of the wines. Actually, very
low sensory experience (tastes of the wines) was reported for the
wines stored longer than 3 days compared to that in 1 day of storage.
Therefore, it is possible to indicate significant changes of wines
during storage with the developed method, and it is better to consume
a wine before significant changes have been observed by ESTASI-MS. Figure 3 also plots 10 peaks
with the highest VIP scores, indicating the most distinctive MS signals
among the same sample after various storage times. Some identical
signals have been observed among the three wines to change significantly,
i.e., at m/z 409, 350, 294, 191,
119, 87, 65, and 147. According to the HPLC-MS/MS identification results
in Table 2, the signals
can be originated from coumarin, succinic acid, glycerol, and diethyl
dicarbonate, which experienced changes possibly due to the volatilization,
fermentation, and oxidation of the wine samples.

analysis (PCA) scores and variable

Storage time is labeled in the inlet. h and d are short for hour and
day, respectively. More information on the analyzed wine A1, A2, and
AG in (a)–(c) can refer to Table 1.

3 Conclusions
A strategy based on ESTASI-MS
was developed to distinguish wines
with different labels. Different wines can be directly analyzed by
ESTASI-MS without any pretreatment. Each ESTASI-MS detection of wine
can be accomplished in 1–2 min without any sample pretreatment,
followed by multivariate statistical analysis for wine identification.
On the basis of the information of the distinctive MS signals indicated
by PCA and PLS-DA models, the compounds in the wine can be further
identified with HPLC-MS. It is promising to apply the developed approach
to wine quality control during wine production and wine storage.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Wines and Chemicals
Five red wines,
Bordeaux (year 2015, France, made with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon
and Cabernet Franc, coded as F), Mendoza (year 2016, Argentina, made
with Malbec, coded as AG), Zhangyu (year 2015, China, made with Cabernet
Gernischt, coded as C), Jacob’s creek classic cabernet (year
2015, Australia, made with Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, coded as
A1), and Jacob’s creek classic merlot (year 2015, Australia,
made with Merlot, coded as A2) were purchased from local supermarkets
in Shanghai (China). The wines were stored at room temperature in
the dark until analysis and immediately analyzed after opening the
bottle to ensure minimum oxidation. Each wine was duplicated in bottle
for the measurement, and all of the experiments were performed at
least in triplicate. Phenacetin (Mw 179.22,
99%) was obtained from J&K Scientific (Beijing, CN). Dextromethorphan
(Mw 271.40, 99%) was obtained from Fluorochem
(Derbyshire, U.K.). Caffeine (Mw 194.19,
≥98%) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). Deionized water
(18.2 MΩ cm) was purified by a Smart-Q deionized water system
(Hitech pure water technology, Shanghai, China) and used in all aqueous
solutions.

4.2 ESTASI-MS Analysis of Wine
Sample
ESTASI-MS analysis was performed using a setup described
previously.14 A linear ion trap mass spectrometer
(Thermo
LTQ) was used as the analyzer. A cylinder electrode made of platinum
with a diameter of 1 mm was used to induce ESTASI. A polyimide (PI)
foil (0.2 mm thick) was used as the sample target. Pulsed high voltage
of 0–8 kV at 500 Hz (square wave) was used to induce ESTASI.
MS scan was performed under positive mode in the mass range of 50–500 m/z, maximum ion injection time of 100
ms, and ion trap capacity of 104. Original wine sample
(2 μL) was deposited on the PI sample target plate. The target
plate was lifted slowly toward MS orifice until ESTASI happened. Usually,
ESTASI happened when the distance between target plate and MS orifice
was 2–3 mm. MS data were recorded until the complete consumption
of the wine sample by ionization and evaporation. The PI foil was
used as a disposable substrate and changed for each sample to avoid
cross-contamination. For aging experiments, the bottles were sealed
with their original caps and stored under room temperature in the
dark.

4.3 Statistical Analyses
MS raw data
were processed by an R package named MALDIquant.17 Peaks with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 3 were extracted
from the processed MS data with the information of m/z and relative intensity to form aligned matrices.
Multivariable statistical analysis to the matrices was performed by
using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca).

4.4 LC-MS Analyses
Wine samples were
filtered by a 0.22 μm microporous membrane prior to high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-MS analysis. The HPLC system (Shimadzu,
Japan) used in this work consisted of two pumps, an autosampler, and
a column thermostat. An Athena C18-WP column (100 Å, 2.1 ×
150 mm2, 3 μm) purchased from CNW technologies (Shanghai,
China) was used. The mobile phase was composed of A (water with 0.1%
formic acid) and B (acetonitrile), with gradient elution being optimized
as 0–3 min (B, 0–2%), 3–5 min (B, 2–40%),
5–14 min (B, 40–80%), and 14–18 min (B, 80%).
Flow rate was set as 0.2 mL/min. Column temperature was controlled
at 25 °C. Sample injection volume was 2 μL.

A Q-TOF
mass spectrometer (Triple TOF 4600, AB Sciex) was coupled with the
HPLC system through an ESI source. Ionization was performed in positive
mode. ESI high voltage was set as 5500 V. Ion source parameters were
optimized as follows: gas 1, 45 psi; gas 2, 50 psi; curtain gas, 30
psi; source temperature, 500 °C. MS/MS data were acquired in
information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode with a maximum precursor
ion number of 10 and mass range of 50–1000 m/z. MasterView (AB Sciex) and FooDB (http://foodb.ca) database were used to
identify peaks from the LC-MS/MS data.
