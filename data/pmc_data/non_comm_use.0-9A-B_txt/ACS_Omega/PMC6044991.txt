Developments
in subcellular fractionation strategies have provided
the means to analyze the protein and lipid composition of organelles
by proteomics. Here, we developed ultrasmall magnetic–plasmonic
hybrid nanobeads and applied them to the isolation of autophagosomes
by applying a magnetic field. The beads were chemically synthesized
and comprised an Ag/FeCo/Ag core/shell/shell structure with a mean
diameter of 15 nm. The Ag core and the FeCo shell conferred imaging
and magnetic separation capabilities, respectively. The nanobeads
were transfected into mammalian cells by lipofection. Thirty minutes
after lipofection, the nanobeads colocalized with Vps26 and subsequently
with LC3. Cell lysates were prepared at the appropriate time points
and were subjected to magnetic separation. The separated fraction
contained LC3-II, transferrin receptor, and LAMP2, but not LC3-I,
suggesting that autophagosomes engulfing endosomal origin had been
isolated. The magnetic separation process was completed in less than
30 min, providing a rapid method for isolation of autophagosomes.
The present organelle isolation technique using the hybrid nanobeads
with imaging and magnetic separation capabilities is highly promising
for isolation of other types of organelles such as endosomes and endosome-related
organelles.

Introduction
Immunomagnetic isolation
is widely used to isolate cells1,2 and subcellular organelles3−9 and involves the use of magnetic beads that are coupled with cell
surface or organelle-specific antibodies. In contrast to classical
purification methods relying on ultracentrifugation, immunomagnetic
isolation is rapid and gentle, which helps to ensure that the isolated
cells and organelles remain intact. In addition to immunomagnetic
isolation, magnetic beads have been used to isolate endocytic organelles,
such as early endosomes10 and late endosomes,11 whereby magnetic beads are delivered into the
lumen of organelles by endocytosis.

Endocytosis from the plasma
membrane is mediated by various types
of membrane-bound vesicles or tubules. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs)
were the first to be discovered12 and remain
the most extensively characterized transport vesicles.13 The diameter of CCVs is 100–150 nm, limiting
the size of materials that can be packaged into this type of vesicle.
Using gold particles coated with transferrin as the cargo, the effect
of bead size on the efficiency of endocytosis by CCVs was previously
examined.14 Indeed, this study showed that
the exocytosis rate of 14 nm gold particles was much faster than that
of 74 nm gold particles.

The size of commercially available
magnetic beads is typically
larger than 200 nm. For example, Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, USA) are typically 1 to 5 μm in diameter; RayBio magnetic
beads (RayBiotech, Norcross, USA) are 500 nm in diameter; and the
smallest beads, MACS MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany), are about 50 nm in diameter, but when coated with antifluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) antibodies, the hydrodynamic diameter increases
to 125 nm.15 Therefore, these magnetic
beads are, in principle, refractory to endocytosis by CCVs.

Compared with conventional magnetic beads, we previously fabricated
ultrasmall magnetic beads (15 nm in diameter) with an Ag/FeCo/Ag core/shell/shell
structure.16 Although the magnetic probe
had a magnetically inert Ag core with a mean size of 10 nm, the magnetic
beads showed separation capability.16 If
the magnetic bead with the same volume of the FeCo shell was composed
of iron oxide, it would be ineffective as a magnetic bead because
the saturation magnetization of iron oxide (400–450 emu/cm3) is approximately a quarter that of FeCo (1790 emu/cm3).17 Therefore, we expect that
our magnetic bead would be easily endocytosed and could be used as
a separation probe for endosome-related organelles.

The presence
of an Ag core provides visualization of the magnetic
bead using a laboratory microscope.16 Metal
nanoparticles, such as Ag and Au nanoparticles, have been used for
cell imaging because of their intrinsic optical properties and localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).18,19 Furthermore,
coupling of the magnetic beads and other biomolecules using strong
metal–thiol interactions can be easily achieved because of
the presence of an outer Ag shell compared with iron oxide particles.
This type of magnetic beads will be referred to as magnetic–plasmonic
hybrid nanobeads (MPNBs) hereafter.

In this study, we chose
autophagosomes as target organelles which
are formed in the cytoplasm in the course of autophagy among many
subcellular organelles. It was reported that micrometer-sized polystyrene
beads that were lipofected into mammalian cells were delivered into
early endosomes where they caused damage. Then, xenophagy (a type
of selective autophagy) occurred, engulfing the damaged endosomes
by autophagosomes.20,21 Although the autophagosomes can
engulf even micrometer-sized beads,21 we
exploited this observation and applied MPNBs to isolated autophagosomes
to demonstrate the capability of MPNBs for magnetic isolation of subcellular
organelles.

Results
Structural Characterization of MPNBs
Ag/FeCo/Ag core/shell/shell
MPNBs were chemically synthesized by our previously reported method.16,22−24Figure 1 shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM; H-7650, Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan) and scanning TEM, equipped with a high-angle annular dark-field
detector (STEM-HAADF; JEM-ARM200F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), images of
the as-synthesized MPNBs. The MPNBs were spherical in shape and a
distinct core–shell structure could be observed. The average
diameter of MPNBs was calculated to be about 15 nm, with the standard
deviation of the size distribution typically being around 16%.16,23,24Figure 1D–G shows the energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images for Ag, Fe, and Co and
a merged image of these elements. It was evident from these images
that the MPNBs have a distinct Ag core and FeCo shell. Figure 1H shows the EDS line profile,
depicted by a yellow line in Figure 1G. The Ag signal clearly increased at the edge of the
MPNBs, confirming the presence of a thin Ag outer shell. The MPNBs
exhibited superparamagnetic behavior at 300 K with a saturation magnetization
value of typically around 33 emu/g.16,23,24

dashed and solid lines are the raw and low-pass-filtered profiles,
respectively. The blue, green, and red colors represent Ag L-, Co
K-, and Fe K-edge intensities, respectively.

Surface Modification of MPNBs
Because the surfaces
of the as-synthesized MPNBs are covered with hydrophobic organic ligands,
we needed to modify the surfaces to make them water-dispersible and
biocompatible. ε-Poly-l-lysine (PLL) is a polymer of l-lysine in which the ε-amino and α-carboxyl groups
are condensed to make an amide bond. Because PLL is water-soluble
and relatively nontoxic compared with α-poly-l-lysine,
its derivatives have been applied in food preservatives, emulsifying
agents, dietary agents, biodegradable fibers, highly water absorbable
hydrogels, drug carriers, and cryopreservation agents.25,26 In this study, 2-iminothiolane was made to react with the amino
group in the side chain of PLL to obtain partially (theoretical substitution
rate of 20%) thiolated PLL (PLL-SH). Figure 2A,B shows the structure and proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum of PLL-SH (actual
substitution rate was determined to be 13%).

polymer. The ratio of l/m is 87:13.

water. (E) UV–vis spectra of MPNBs before (black) and after
(red) ligand exchange. (F) Hydrodynamic diameter of MPNBs plotted
as a function of elapsed time after ligand exchange.

Figure 2C shows
the pH dependence of the zeta potential of PLL-SH dissolved in water.
At pH 7, the zeta potential of PLL-SH was around +20 mV. There are
several possible reasons for the negative zeta potential under alkaline
conditions. One possible reason is the proton dissociation of thiol
groups; another is that the protonated amino groups are surrounded
by excess counter ions.27 The surface of
MPNBs were modified with PLL-SH via a ligand exchange reaction; then,
MPNBs could be readily dispersed in water as shown in Figure 2D. The zeta potential of PLL-SH-modified
MPNBs dispersed in water was measured to be about +42 mV (the pH value
was found to be 6). When the pH value was adjusted to be 7 by adding
NaOH solution, the zeta potential of PLL-SH-modified MPNBs was measured
to be +7 mV.

Figure 2E shows
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of MPNBs before
and after ligand exchange. The UV–vis spectrum of MPNBs before
ligand exchange showed the LSPR peak at 405 nm. After ligand exchange,
the LSPR peak of water-dispersible MPNBs red-shifted from 405 to 415
nm. Typically, the LSPR peak wavelength linearly increases with increasing
the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Therefore, the red
shift of the LSPR peak is presumably due to the ligand exchange with
PLL-SH which has the higher refractive index than hexane, water, and
hydrophobic organic ligands. Because the extinction of the LSPR band
is linearly proportional to the concentration of MPNBs,16 one can precisely estimate the concentration
of MPNBs from the UV–vis spectrum. The concentration of the
undiluted water dispersion of MPNBs was estimated to be 5.2 mg/mL
from the UV–vis spectrum and was used in the following cellular
experiment.

Colloidal stability of PLL-SH-modified MPNBs dispersed
in water
was investigated by measuring the hydrodynamic size of MPNBs as a
function of elapsed time after ligand exchange as shown in Figure 2F. The hydrodynamic
diameter of MPNBs slightly increased from 37 ± 5 to 81 ±
26 nm within 14 days.

Lipofection of MPNBs into COS-1 Cells
PLL-SH-modified
MPNBs were transfected into COS-1 cells by lipofection. At an appropriate
time after lipofection, the cells were fixed, stained for Vps26 (an
early endosomal marker protein) or LC3 (an autophagosomal marker protein),
and examined by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; FV 1000D,
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Thirty-minutes after transfection, the MPNBs
partly colocalized with Vps26 (Figure 3A), but not with LC3 (Figure 3C). One hour after lipofection, there emerged
a few MPNB-positive structures that were surrounded by LC3 (Figure 3D). Those structures
were mostly evident 2 and 4 h after lipofection (Figure 3E,F). These results indicated
that the MPNBs were first delivered into early endosomes and then
targeted to autophagosomes. Note that the imaging of MPNBs was achieved
by utilizing plasmon scattering (not fluorescence) in the present
study. Because it has been known that Ag nanoparticles can become
fluorescent only when their diameter is smaller than typically 2.5
nm,28−30 the 10 nm Ag core is not fluorescent, but can act
as an efficient scatterer because the scattering cross section of
Ag nanoparticles is more than 1 order of magnitude higher than that
of Au nanoparticles.31

and Ag/FeCo/Ag MPNBs, respectively. Red color represents Vps26 (A,B)
or LC3 (C–F). All scale bars correspond to 10 μm. The
inset shown at the bottom right of panel (A) is a magnified view of
the region enclosed by the yellow line in panel (A).

Next, we examined the COS-1 cells lipofected with
MPNBs by TEM
(JEM-1200 EX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The TEM images of the cells for
30 min and 2 h after the lipofection of MPNBs are shown in Figure 4; at these same time
points, the MPNBs were shown to be surrounded by Vps26 (Figure 3A) or LC3 (Figure 3E) by immunostaining. We detected
the electron-dense granular substances within membrane-bound structures.
Since the mean diameter of MPNBs is about 15 nm, the electron-dense
granular substances were considered to be a complex assembly between
the transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000) and MPNBs. In fact,
as shown in the inset of Figure 4D, individual MPNBs can be clearly seen in the high-contrast
magnified view of the electron-dense granular substance. As shown
in Figure 4A–C,
some MPNBs were found to be incorporated in single (endosome-like)
or double (autophagosome-like) membrane compartments in the case of
the cells for 30 min after the lipofection of MPNBs. As shown in Figure 4D–F, on the
other hand, most of MPNBs seemed to be incorporated in autophagolysosome-like
structures in the case of the cells for 2 h after the lipofection
of MPNBs.

is a magnified view of a complex assembly between transfection reagent
and MPNBs. Each small black dot is a single Ag/FeCo/Ag MPNB.

Magnetic Separation of
Autophagosomes
An overview of
the magnetic separation protocol is depicted in Figure 5A. The cells lipofected with MPNBs were detached
from the culture dish using a cell lifter at the appropriate time
and homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton Industries
Inc., Millville, USA). The resultant cell lysates were subjected to
magnetic separation using an autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The magnetically separated fraction was
then eluted from the column, briefly spun, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The cell lysate and magnetically separated (MS) fractions
were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and blotted for LC3, transferrin receptor (TfnR, an endosomal
protein), lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), and cytosolic
protein [glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)]. As shown
in Figure 5B, at time
0, the proteins of interest were not detected in the MS fraction.
After 15 min, LC3-II (a membrane-bound form of LC3), TfnR, and LAMP2,
but not GAPDH, were detected in the MS fraction. The level of LC3-II
and LAMP2 in the MS fractions increased up to 8 h, whereas that of
TfnR plateaued after 2 h. Throughout the separation experiments, GAPDH
and LC3-I (a cytosolic form of LC3) were not detected in the MS fractions.
These results indicated that at early time points (0.5 < t < 2 h, where t denotes the incubation
time), autophagosomes were mainly isolated and, by contrast, at a
later time point (t > 2 h), autophagolysosomes
were
isolated.

Discussion
In
the present study, we fabricated nanobeads that have magnetic
and imaging capabilities. We then applied these beads to isolate autophagosomes,
exploiting a previous observation that lipofected latex bead-induced
xenophagy of damaged early endosomes.20,21 The MS fraction
contained LC3-II, TfnR, and LAMP2 but not LC3-I, indicating that autophagosomes/autophagolysosomes
were successfully isolated. The isolation process essentially required
two steps (homogenization and magnetic separation) and took less than
30 min to complete. Rapidly isolated autophagosomes/autophagolysosomes
may lose less peripherally associated proteins, and proteomic/lipidomic
analysis should therefore provide valuable information on the molecules
that are involved in autophagosome generation and maturation into
autophagolysosomes. There are several biochemical methods to prevent
fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes to improve the purity
of autophagosomes in ultracentrifugation32,33 or immunomagnetic isolation.34 By combining
these biochemical methods with the present magnetic separation technique
using the MPNBs, it will enable a swift and mild purification of autophagosomes
formed in xenophagy.

The differences between the present MPNBs
and conventional magnetic
probes are summarized as follows regarding magnetic property, size,
imaging capability, and functionalization. The saturation magnetization
of MPNBs24 normalized to a single particle
volume is about 250 emu/cm3, which is almost comparable
to that of iron oxide nanoparticles of the same size. Although an
MPNB contains a 10 nm Ag core corresponding to 30% of the volume of
the bead, the reason why MPNBs show comparable magnetic properties
to iron oxide is that the saturation magnetization of FeCo is 4 times
higher than that of iron oxide. As shown in the photograph in Figure 5, most MPNBs were
efficiently separated, and thus the positive selection (PS) was brown,
whereas the negative selection (NS) was colorless.

The smallest-sized
conventional magnetic bead is about 50 nm in
diameter (MACS MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec). The hydrodynamic diameter
of FITC antibody-conjugated MACS MicroBeads dispersed in PBS is 125
nm,15 whereas that of MPNBs dispersed in
water is much smaller at 37 nm (81 nm even after 14 days from ligand
exchange). When the MPNBs were mixed with the transfection reagent
in Opti-MEM (which corresponds to the conditions just before lipofection
of MPNBs into cells), the hydrodynamic diameter of MPNBs was found
to increase up to 1352 ± 182 nm as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). This result clearly
indicates that complex assemblies between the transfection reagent
and MPNBs are formed, which are consistent with the TEM observations
(Figure 4).

Cell
cytotoxicity is also an important issue when working with
cells. Therefore, we performed additional experiments to investigate
cell cytotoxicity of the MPNBs as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The COS-1 cells were
treated with 5, 10, and 20 μg/mL of MPNBs for 1, 2, and 4 h,
respectively. The viability was measured with the intracellular esterase
activity. The results showed no obvious dose-dependent decrease of
cell viability, whereas the time-dependent decrease of cell viability
was clearly observed. However, when the treatment time was shorter
than 2 h, the cell viability was still higher than 70%, and thus there
seems to be no significant influence on the isolation of autophagosomes
because autophagosomes were isolated at early time points (0.5 < t < 2 h). Note that the concentration of MPNBs used in
the transfection experiments was 6.7 μg/mL.

The striking
feature of the MPNBs is the imaging capability. To
examine the localization of the beads in a cell, TEM observations
or modification of the beads with fluorescent dyes was generally required.
The MPNBs require neither TEM observations nor modification with fluorescent
dyes because of their intrinsic optical properties (plasmon scattering).
Because plasmon scattering is observed semipermanently, it can be
used robustly even under severe conditions regardless of environmental
changes. Plasmonic properties of MPNBs can be utilized not only for
imaging but also for sensing. For example, the pH of the environment
where the nanoparticles are localized could be measured using surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy.35 The spatially resolved imaging of the pH in live cells could be
achieved using gold nanoparticles as probes and 4-mercaptobenzoic
acid as the Raman reporter. The SERS spectrum of the Raman reporter
changed depending on the surrounding pH. Therefore, the MPNBs presented
here can also be used as SERS probes to quantitatively determine the
pH in the luminal space of endosomes/endosome-related organelles.

Because the surface of the MPNBs used in this study is covered
with PLL-SH, similar to the polymer-coated iron oxide particles, the
MPNBs are readily conjugated to proteins or biomolecules through an
amino group in PLL. Ligand-conjugated MPNBs can be delivered to specific
compartments, such as recycling endosomes36 and the trans-Golgi network,37 which
allows the isolation of these compartments for in vitro functional
assays and proteomics studies in the future.

Conclusions
In
this study, monodispersed Ag/FeCo/Ag core/shell/shell MPNBs
with a mean diameter of 15 nm were chemically synthesized, and then
the nanobeads were transfected into the COS-1 cells by lipofection.
After incubation for a finite period of time (0–8 h), the localization
of nanobeads in a cell was visualized by confocal microscopy using
plasmon scattering of Ag cores. The nanobeads reached early endosomes
within 30 min, and subsequently, the nanobeads became positive with
LC3. Then, the autophagosomes containing the nanobeads were successfully
isolated by the magnetic separation technique. This process took only
∼30 min after cell lysis, providing a swift way to isolate
autophagosomes. In consequence, the capability of MPNBs for magnetic
isolation of subcellular organelles is clearly demonstrated, and it
is highly promising for isolation of other types of organelles such
as endosomes/endosome-related organelles, the trans-Golgi network,
and even CCVs.

Synthesis
of Ag/FeCo/Ag MPNBs
The synthetic scheme
for Ag/FeCo/Ag MPNBs has been described in our previous papers.16,22−24 Briefly, 0.1 mmol of AgNO3, 10 mmol of
OLA, 8 mmol of OA, and 10 mL of TEG were placed into a three-neck
flask, which was connected to a condenser attached to a trap sphere.
After Ar bubbling at room temperature for 5 min, the temperature was
increased to 100 °C and maintained at this temperature for 10
min. Then, the temperature was further increased to 250 °C. During
this increase in temperature, the first stock solution containing
0.2 mmol of Fe(acac)3, 0.2 mmol of Co(acac)2, 1 mL of OLA, and 2 mL of toluene was injected while maintaining
the temperature. Once 250 °C had been reached, the second stock
solution containing 0.1 mmol of AgNO3, 1 mL of OLA, and
1 mL of toluene was injected into the reaction solution. Immediately
after the second injection, the temperature was decreased to 230 °C
within 15 min. Then, the reaction solution was cooled down following
a washing process. The reaction solution was divided into two centrifuge
tubes. Then, acetone was added to a final volume of 45 mL, following
centrifugation at 3760g for 5 min. After discarding
the supernatant, 400 μL of hexane was added into two tubes to
disperse the MPNBs. Then, 200 μL of dispersion was transferred
into new tubes, and acetone was added to the four tubes to make final
volumes of 45 mL. The four tubes were centrifuged under the same conditions,
and the MPNBs were obtained after discarding the supernatant. The
MPNBs were kept in a vacuum drying system. The as-synthesized Ag/FeCo/Ag
MPNBs were characterized by TEM operated at 100 kV, EDS-attached STEM-HAADF
detector operated at 200 kV with a spherical aberration corrector
and a nominal resolution of 0.8 Å and UV–vis spectroscopy
(V-750, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan).

Synthesis of the PLL-SH
Polymer
PLL aqueous solution
(10 mmol, 25 wt %) was placed in a glass vial, and the pH was adjusted
to 7 by adding a small amount of HCl; then, 2 mmol of 2-iminothiolane
was added to give a substitutional ratio of 20% for the thiol group.
The aqueous solution was mixed using a magnetic stirrer bar for 2
h at room temperature. Then, the products were obtained following
dialysis for 2 days using the dialysis membrane (molecular weight
cutoff of 500) and freeze-drying for 2 days. The substitutional ratio
of the thiol group was calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum
of the polymer sample. The 1H NMR spectrum of PLL-SH dissolved
in D2O was recorded at 25 °C using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
(BioSpin AVANCE III, Bruker, Billerica, USA). The zeta potential of
PLL-SH was determined by plotting the zeta potential against pH. The
zeta potential of PLL-SH dissolved in pure water (1 mg/mL) was measured
using a Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN3600 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern,
UK) instrument. To tune the pH of the polymer solution (1 mL), a small
amount of HCl or NaOH was added. These measurements were repeated
several times, and the average and standard deviation were estimated
for each pH.

Ligand Exchange of the MPNBs
The
as-synthesized MPNBs
were capped with hydrophobic molecules such as OLA and OA; hence,
they could only be dispersed in a nonpolar solvent. To make them water-soluble,
the capping ligands on the surface of the MPNBs were exchanged with
PLL-SH. The precipitate of MPNBs in two tubes was dispersed in 200
μL of hexane. Then, 10 mg of PLL-SH was dispersed in 1 mL of
pure water, and 100 μL of ethanol was added to the PLL-SH aqueous
solution. The hexane dispersion of MPNBs was added to the PLL-SH aqueous
solution, followed by sonication for 30 min to enhance the phase-transfer
reaction at the interface between the water and hexane phases. During
sonication, more pure water (5 mL) was added. The mixture was transferred
into six 1.5 mL tubes, and the total volume of each tube was made
up to 1 mL; then, the tubes were centrifuged twice at 54 879g for 3 min (himac CS100FNX, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Finally,
a small amount of pure water was added to redisperse the MPNBs. Then,
all MPNBs were collected in one tube. The concentration of the Ag/FeCo/Ag
MPNBs was determined by measuring the UV–vis spectrum and using
the master curve of y = 0.024x [y: extinction intensity, x: concentration
of the MPNBs (μg/mL)]. The zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter
of PLL-SH-modified MPNBs dispersed in pure water were measured using
a Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN3600 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK)
instrument.

CLSM Imaging
Sterilized coverslips
of 12 mm diameter
(Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) were treated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-l-lysine aqueous solution for 10 min. Then, after discarding the solution
the coverslips were dried and washed three times in PBS. The coverslips
were then stored in PBS at room temperature before use. The COS-1
cells (20 000) in 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate in which
a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip had been placed. Then, the
cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, 1 μL
of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was mixed with 50 μL of Opti-MEM.
After 5 min, 50 μL of Opti-MEM containing 4 μg of MPNBs
was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min. Then, 100 μL
of the mixture was added into each well, and the cells and MPNBs were
incubated for 30 min, 1, 2, and 4 h. After incubation, the supernatant
was removed and washed with PBS. The cells were fixed with 4%-paraformaldehyde
phosphate buffer solution for 15 min and then washed with PBS. The
cells were next permeabilized with 50 μg/mL digitonin–PBS
for 5 min and then washed with PBS. Quenching was then performed with
50 mM NH4Cl–PBS for 10 min, followed by a PBS wash.
The sample was blocked with 3% BSA–PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
After discarding the blocking solution, primary antibody in 3% BSA–PBS
(for LC3 and Vps26) was added, and the samples were incubated at 4
°C overnight. The next day, the sample was washed with PBS for
5 min three times and then treated with the secondary antibody (Alexa
Fluor 594 antimouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 antigoat IgG) and 300
nM DAPI in 3% BSA–PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The sample
was then washed three times with PBS for 5 min. The glass coverslip
was carefully removed and placed on the mount agent on a glass substrate
for CLSM (FV 1000D, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) observation. To observe
the samples, laser wavelengths of 405 and 559 nm were used for DAPI
and LC3 or Vps26 observations. To detect plasmon scattering from the
MPNBs, the sample was irradiated using a laser wavelength of 559 nm.

Magnetic Separation Protocol for Autophagosomes and Sample Preparation
The COS-1 cells (550 000) were seeded into 10 cm-culture
dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C overnight.
The next day, 10 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 500
μL of Opti-MEM. After 5 min, 500 μL of Opti-MEM containing
40 μg of MPNBs was added, and the mixture was incubated for
20 min. Then, 1 mL of the mixture was added into each dish. After
incubation for 0 min (10 s), 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and
8 h at 37 °C, the culture medium was aspirated. The cells were
washed with 10 mL of ice cold PBS twice; then, 1 mL of PBS containing
protease inhibitor cocktail was added. The COS-1 cells were harvested
from the dish using a cell lifter on ice. Then, the cell dispersion
was transferred into a Dounce tissue grinder, and a homogenate was
obtained in 20 strokes using a loose glass pole on ice. Then, the
homogenate was subjected to magnetic separation using an autoMACS
Pro Separator. The separation program was selected as “Posseld”
in which 0.5 mL of the PS (magnetically attracted fraction) is obtained.
Then, the PS was centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min at
4 °C. The running buffer was gently removed, and 200 μL
of PBS was added to disperse the precipitate to obtain the autophagosome-enriched
MS fractions. Then, 200 μL of freshly prepared sample buffer
(50 μL of 2-mercaptoethanol and 950 μL of 2× Laemmli
sample buffer) was added to the autophagosome-enriched fraction, and
the sample was heated at 95 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated
into several tubes and stored at −20 °C until use. For
the control experiment, the sample was prepared by the same protocol
as the homogenate with a 2 h incubation in the presence of transfection
reagent only.

Sample Preparation for TEM Observation of
MPNB-Incorporated
Autophagosomes
The cells were incubated for 30 min or 2 h
with transfected MPNBs. After washing in PBS twice, the cells were
fixed in phosphate-buffered 2% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C and subsequently
postfixed in 2% osmium tetra-oxide for 3 h in an ice bath. Then, the
specimens were dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in epoxy
resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained by an ultramicrotome technique.
Ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate for 10 min and lead-staining
solution for 5 min were submitted for TEM observation.

SDS-PAGE and
Western Blotting
The homogenate and MS
fractions (50 μL of each sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE
using a 15% polyacrylamide gel. A constant voltage was applied until
the protein bands reached close to the end of the gel. Then, the gel
was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad)
in CAPS buffer (10 mM CAPS and 10% of methanol, pH 11) by the semi-dry
method. After blotting, the membrane was washed with Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.05% TWEEN 20 (TBST) and blocked with 5%
skim milk in TBST for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the
membrane with TBST, primary antibodies (against LC3, TfnR, LAMP2,
and GAPDH) in 5% BSA TBST were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight.
The next day, the membrane was washed with TBST, and then secondary
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, immunoreactive
bands were detected using a chemiluminescence detector (LAS-3000,
Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
