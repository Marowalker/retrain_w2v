Pluronics
(tri-block copolymers) have a significant role in the
pharmaceutical industry and are being used to enhance the solubility
and delivery of hydrophobic drugs in different marketed formulations.
However, instability and unsatisfactory drug-loading capacity are
the major weak spots of these pluronic micelles. The present research
work is designed to solve the existing issues by the solubilization
study of hydrophobic drugs in different pluronic micelles at variable
temperatures. The solubilization of the hydrophobic antiepileptic
drug lamotrigine (LAM) in five different pluronic micelles viz. P84,
P85, F127, F108, and F68 was studied at different temperatures, 37,
47, and 57 °C, using UV–visible spectroscopy. The solubilization
of LAM in pluronic micelles increased with the increase in temperature.
Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were used to observe
the morphological and structural changes taking place in pluronics
by increasing the temperature. The SANS results showed the morphological
changes of spherical P84 micelles to prolate ellipsoidal micelles
at 57 °C due to remarkable increase in the aggregation number.
This morphological conversion was further confirmed by the heat transfer
method (HTM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. DLS
measurements confirmed that LAM-loaded micelles showed a greater hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) compared to unloaded micelles,
assuring LAM solubilization in the pluronic micelles. The rate of
controlled release of LAM from five different pluronic micelles was
accessed by using different kinetic models to evaluate the in vitro
release profile. This is the first report in which HTM measurements
are established for the analysis of morphological changes in the thermoresponsive
pluronic micelles in real time. The present work corroborates how
we can control the drug-loading capacity, morphological structure
of the drug carrier, as well as drug release by simply changing the
temperature of pluronic micellar media.

1 Introduction
Poor water solubility of drugs is the most important hurdle in
the pharmaceutical industry and research. The development of better
formulations of approved drugs is one of the most successful strategies
of scientific and industrial importance.1−3 In this context, delivery
of hydrophobic drug via pluronic micelles is an interesting alternative.
Pluronics, triblock copolymers, are US-FDA approved excipients for
many marketed formulations and are currently used in parenteral injections.
Pluronics consist of hydrophilic block poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
and hydrophobic block poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) in a triblock structure
of PEO–PPO–PEO. The hydrophilic PEO block of the pluronic
micelle is effective against serum protein adsorption, which improves
the stability of the nanomicellar system and increases drug delivery.
Pluronics play a significant role in pharmaceutical performance to
increase the solubility, bioavailability, release, and stability of
hydrophobic drug molecules.4−8 Pluronics modulate the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein on
the blood brain barrier (BBB) results in the enhancement the BBB penetration
of pluronic-loaded hydrophobic drugs. According to recent findings,
in the drug resistance, P-glycoproteins are over-expressed and pluronics
can act as modulators of P-glycoproteins; hence, as a drug carrier
for the treatment of multidrug-resistant diseases, pluronic micellar
formulations can be useful.9−13

Lamotrigine (LAM), 3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-tria-zine,
is a novel antiepileptic drug, and it is also used in the treatment
of primary and secondary tonic–clonic seizures and seizures
associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. The antiepileptic
effect of LAM is due to the stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes;
moreover, LAM inhibits sodium currents by selectively binding with
the inactivated state of the sodium channel and results in repressing
the release of the excitatory amino acid (such as, glutamate and aspartate).14,15 LAM belongs to the biopharmaceutical classification system class
II drug with a pKa of 5.70. It is practically
insoluble in ethanol, and the solubility of LAM in water is only 0.17
mg/mL at 25 °C.16 Therefore, the dissolution
of LAM is the rate-limiting step for its efficient absorption and
bioavailability in the body. Different research scientists have attempted
to increase the water solubility and dissolution of LAM to improve
its therapeutic effects. The following strategies have been employed:
use of β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, LAM salts, and solid
dispersions of LAM.17−20 To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of LAM, its aqueous solubility
needs to be improved. In order to achieve this goal, we have prepared
the five different pluronic micellar formulations at three different
temperatures to optimize the solubility of LAM.

There are very
limited reports in the literature on the effect
of temperature on the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs in the pluronic
micelles. Basak and Bandyopadhyay described the encapsulation of the
three drug molecules, erythromycin, ibuprofen, and aspirin in pluronic
F127 micelles using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence
measurements. They observed that the average hydrodynamic radii (Dh) of the pluronic F127 micelles were increased
upon drug incorporation.21 Kadam et al.
reported the solubilization of the hydrophobic drug carbamazepine
in pluronic micelles (P103, P123, P84, and F127) at two different
temperatures by employing UV spectroscopy and DLS measurements. They
observed that the solubilization capacity of carbamezapine in the
pluronic micelles increased with the increase in temperature and concentration
of pluronics.22 Raval et al. studied the
micellar behavior of the aqueous solutions of six pluronics viz. P84,
F88, P103, P105, P123, and F127 in water and studied the solubility
of three poorly water soluble anticancer drugs, genistein, paclitaxel,
and quercetin, using UV–visible spectroscopy, high-performance
liquid chromatography, and DLS. All these investigated drugs showed
improved solubility in pluronic P123 and P103 micelles with the increase
in temperature and salt concentration. In vitro drug-release profiles
of these formulations demonstrated slower release of the drugs in
pluronic micelles. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the drug-loaded pluronic
micelles was studied on a breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, which showed
higher anticancer activity as compared to the bare drug. These results
show that pluronics are promising candidates for anticancer drug delivery.23 In contrast to these studies, the main objective
of our work is to find the relation between temperature, the structure
of the pluronics, and its drug solubilization capacity. For this purpose,
we have studied the solubilization of the hydrophobic drug LAM in
five different pluronics micelles viz. P84 (PEO19PPO43PEO19), P85 (PEO26PPO40PEO26), F127 (PEO100PPO65PEO100), F108 (PEO133PPO50PEO133), and
F68 (PEO77PPO29PEO77) with 40, 50,
70, 80, and 80% PEO content, respectively, at different temperatures
(37, 47, and 57 °C) using UV–visible measurements. The
molecular structures of LAM and different pluronics are presented
in Scheme 1. Hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) of the loaded and unloaded
micelles has been studied employing DLS measurements. Furthermore,
the effect of the temperature and LAM solubilization in the investigated
different pluronic micelles has been adjudged employing indigenously
built small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and the heat transfer
method (HTM).24−26 In vitro drug release studies were performed to evaluate
the relation of LAM release from these micelles with respect to increase
in the temperature.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Solubilization of LAM
2.1.1 Effect of Concentration
The solubilization
of LAM in the different pluronic F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84 micellar
solutions was determined by UV–visible spectroscopy. The UV
absorption spectra of LAM solubilized in the F108, F127, P85, and
P84 micelles were measured in the concentration range of 1–5%
w/v at 37 °C (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The UV absorption of LAM increased significantly in all studied
pluronic solutions except for pluronic F68, implying that the pluronic
micelles are able to solubilize LAM. The difference in behavior of
pluronic F68 has been ascribed to its inability to self-assemble at
the studied concentration and temperature, thereby, making it difficult
to solubilize the drug.27,28 The results for the
solubilization capacities of the different pluronics for LAM are summarized
in Figure 1a. The solubility
pattern of the drug in the different pluronics follow the order P84
> P85 > F127 > F108 > F68 at all % w/v. These results
can be explained
by taking into consideration the PEO effect and the PPO effect of
the different pluronics. Pluronic P84 shows higher solubilization
than pluronic P85, irrespective of the presence of almost similar
PO units (43 and 40 PPO units in P84 and P85, respectively) and differing
in the presence of hydrophilic PEO units (2 × 19 and 2 ×
26 PEO units in P84 and P85, respectively). On the other hand, pluronics
F127 and F108 with small difference in PO units (65 and 50 PPO units
in F127 and F108, respectively) and relatively larger difference in
the PEO units (2 × 100 and 2 × 133 PEO units in F127 and
F108, respectively) exhibited higher solubilization in F127 as compared
to F108. The results are a clear indication that the solubilization
capacity of the pluronic micelles decreases as the PEO units forming
the corona region increases. Our results are in agreement with the
work of Alexandridis et al., which states that the micellization of
pluronics decreases as the length of the corona increases.27

°C (b) Amount of LAM solubilized in 5% w/v pluronic (F68, F108,
F127, P85 and P84) at 37, 47, and 57 °C.

2.1.2 Effect of Temperature
The solubilization
of LAM has been studied at different temperatures, that is 37, 47,
and 57 °C, in the different pluronic (P85, P84, F108, F127, and
F68) solutions. We noticed that the solubilization trend at 47 and
57 °C was the same as that observed at 37 °C (increased
in the following order P84 > P85 > F127 > F108 > F68).
However, the
amount of LAM solubilized in a pluronic micellar system increased
remarkably as the temperature increased [Figure 1b]. UV absorption spectra of LAM solubilized
in 5% w/v F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84 micelles at 37, 47, and 57
°C are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). This was attributed to the increase in the area for solubilization
of LAM in the pluronic micelles due to thermal agitation, in addition
to the fact that LAM solubility in water also increases with increase
in temperature.29−31 Alkhamis et al. reported similar results in case
of solubilization of the drug, gliclazide as a function of the concentration
of different amphiphiles at variable temperatures: 25 and 37 °C;
all ionic surfactants investigated showed higher solubilization of
drugs at 37 °C as compared to 25 °C. The influence of temperature
on the amount of drug loading also depends on whether the drug molecules
solubilized inside PEO, forming the hydrophilic corona or PPO, forming
the hydrophobic core region of the pluronic micelles.32 In one report, there was decrease in the solubilization
of hydrophobic steroidal drugs in PEO-based surfactant micelles, when
the temperature was increased from 10 to 50 °C. The solubilization
of the drug in the PEO corona region of micelles is the reason behind
the decrease in solubility of drugs. Upon increasing the temperature,
there was dehydration of the PEO region and this leads to a decrease
in the solubilizing area available for the drug. The micellar growth
of the pluronic micelles obtained as a result of increased temperature
is the driving force for the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs that
especially prefer the core region of the micelles.33 In our case, solubility was increased with increasing temperature
and therefore, it can be concluded that most of the LAM drug has been
solubilized in the core region of the pluronics. This micellar growth
has been confirmed by the SANS measurements (Section 2.3). It is also
important to mention that the CMT (critical micelle temperature) value
of the pluronic P84, P85, F127, F108, and F68 (at 5% w/v) is 23, 25,
19.5, 24.5, and 40 °C, respectively.27 Pluronic F127 has the lowest CMT value, and hence, the drug solubilization
capacity of this pluronic is lower than pluronic P85 and P84 that
have the high CMT values. From these results, it was concluded that
the solubility of drugs is not only dependent on the CMTs of the pluronics.
Other important molecular characteristic such as PEO content also
plays an important role in the solubilization of the drugs. The compilation
of the hydrophobic drug LAM solubilization data for a wide range of
pluronic block copolymers at different temperatures presented in this
article is, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete in literature.

The drug loading efficiency (DLE) is the percentage of solubilized
LAM from the LAM fed in pluronic micelles during the solubilization
process and can be calculated from the following eq 1. 1  

The values
of DLE of 1–5% w/v pluronics at 37 °C and
5% w/v pluronics at 37, 47, and 57 °C are depicted in Figure
S3a,b respectively (Supporting Information).

The DLE of P84 is higher as compared to different pluronics
under
study at all concentrations and temperatures by virtue of its hydrophobicity.
It is well established that hydrophobicity of pluronics can be improved
by increasing the PPO content. Accordingly, P84, having a 60% PPO
content which is relatively higher than other pluronics under study,
displayed the highest DLE.34,35

The partition
coefficient is a crucial parameter used for the assessment
of the micellar systems as potential drug carriers.36 The micellar/water partition coefficient can be calculated
from the photo-spectrometric results and is defined as the ratio of
the amount of drug solubilized in the micelle and the drug present
in water at a particular amphiphilic concentration (eq 2). 2  where Stot and Sw is the total solubility of LAM and solubility
of LAM in water, respectively. The partition coefficients have been
computed, depicted in Figure S4a for pluronic
F108, F127, P85, and P84 micelles in the concentration range of 1–5%
w/v at 37 °C and are shown in Figure 2a for 5% F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84 at
different temperature viz. 37, 47 and 57 °C. It was observed
that the value of the partition coefficient increased by increasing
the temperature among all pluronics. The highest value of the partition
coefficient was noted in P84 micelles at all temperatures, confirming
the better partitioning of solubilized LAM in these micelles compared
to other investigated pluronic micelles. Higher partitioning of LAM
in P84 micelles at all temperatures revealed the higher drug solubilization
in the core of these micelles by inducing a favorable hydrophobic
environment compared to other investigated pluronic micelles.37

different pluronic (F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84) micelles at various
concentrations (1–5% w/v) solubilized at 37, 47, and 57 °C
(b) Gibbs free energy of solubilization (ΔG°) 5% w/v pluronic (F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84) solubilized

The standard free energy of solubilization (ΔG°) can be calculated from the partition coefficient
and is represented
by the following expression 3 3  where R denotes the gas constant
(J/mol), T is the temperature (in Kelvin), and P is the partition coefficient. The ΔG° value depicts the Gibbs free energy of transfer of 1 mol of
the drug in the micellar phase. The ΔG°
values are depicted in the Figure S4b for
pluronic F108, F127, P85, and P84 micelles in the concentration range
of 1–5% w/v at 37 °C and shown in Figure 2b for 5% F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84 at
different temperature viz. 37, 47, and 57 °C. Figure 2b reveals that the values of
ΔG° are negative except pluronic F68 at
37and 47 °C, showing that the process of LAM solubilization in
pluronic micelles is spontaneous and transfer of water molecules from
the micellar core induces a more hydrophobic environment.38−40 The positive ΔG° values of pluronic
F68 might be due to the inability of F68 to form the micelles at the
concentration and temperature (37 and 47 °C) being studied.

2.2 Dynamic Light Scattering
DLS experiments
were performed to find the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of pluronic micelles as a function of temperature increase
as depicted in Figure 3a,b for the Dh of aqueous solutions of
5% w/v P84 and F127 at increasing temperatures 37, 47, and 57 °C. Dh of aqueous solutions of 5% w/v P85 and 5%
w/v F108 and F68 at increasing temperatures 37, 47, and 57 °C
are presented in Figure S5a–c (Supporting Information), respectively. In the case of hydrophobic pluronics,
viz. P84 and P85, the micellar size was observed to increase with
increasing the temperature, which revealed that aggregation is stimulated
by the increase in temperature.

Figure 3 Intensity weighed size distribution profiles
of pluronic micelles
at 37, 47, and 57 °C (a) P84 and (b) F127.

At 37 °C, the Dh of P84
micelles
is 13.54 nm, but at the temperature 47 and 57 °C, Dh of P84 micelles increased from 13.54 to 18.16 nm and
37.54 nm, respectively; hydrophobic pluronic P85 exhibits similar
increase in Dh of micelles. Pluronics
F127 and F108 formed loosely packed micelles involving few monomers,
so an increase in temperature results in the removal of water and
formation of more closely packed micelles with altogether decrease
in the Dh of the micelles. In the case
of very hydrophilic pluronic F68, different peaks correlating to micelles,
clusters, and unimers are present at 37 °C. Increase in the temperature,
decreases the polydispersity and makes the unimers and clusters disappear,
which results in the single micellar peak. Dh of 5% w/v P84 and F127, LAM loaded and unloaded micelles
in aqueous solution at 37, 47, and 57 °C were measured and are
depicted in Figure 4a,b, respectively.

Figure 4 Intensity weighed size-distribution profiles for empty
and LAM-loaded
pluronic micelles (a) P84 and (b) F127 measured by DLS.

DLS plots of P85, F108, and F68 are depicted in
Figure S6a–c
(Supporting Information). The micelle size
of P85 at 37, 47, and 57 °C was 11.83, 13.76, and 17.59 nm, respectively,
but after incorporation of LAM, it increases to 13.36, 16.13, and
17.59 nm, respectively. The micelle size of F108 at 37, 47, and 57
°C was 32.67, 29.33, and 27.44 nm, respectively, but after incorporation
of LAM, it increases to 35.39, 32.53, and 32.05 nm, respectively.
The micelle size of F68 at 47 and 57 °C was 8.66 and 8.99 nm,
respectively, but after incorporation of LAM, it increases to 9.98
and 10.10 nm, respectively.

2.3 SANS Measurements
Micellar structure
of the 5% w/v pluronics, viz. F68, F108, F127, P85, and P84 were obtained
from SANS measurements at different temperatures: 37, 47, and 57 °C.
Scattering curves of pluronic P84 and F68 are presented in Figure 5a,b respectively,
and pluronic P85, F127, and F108 are presented in Figure S7a–c
(Supporting Information), respectively.
At 37 °C, the SANS distribution curves of all pluronics show
the existence of correlation peaks which arise because of the hard
sphere repulsion between the micelles except pluronic F68.41 The presence of unimers was only observed in
the pluronic F68 at 37 °C due to the high CMT value of F68 (CMT
of 5% w/v 68 = 40 °C).42 The value
of aggregation number (Nagg) is higher
in the pluronic P84 than that in P85, F127, and F108. The higher Nagg value of hydrophobic pluronic P84 is attributed
to the minimal stability of this pluronic in water as compared to
other investigated pluronics.43 The higher
aggregation number of P84 is responsible for its larger hard sphere
radii (RHS = 82.0) than P85 (RHS = 71.9). Conversely, the hard sphere radius values
are higher in hydrophilic pluronics, F108 (RHS = 102.5) and F127 (RHS = 102.0)
than in pluronic P84, which signifies the more intermicellar interaction
of F108 and micelles than that of P84 due to the longer corona region.
Volume fraction (ϕ) values of hydrophilic pluronics, F127 (ϕ
= 0.158) and F108 (ϕ = 0.142) are higher as compared to the
hydrophobic pluronics P84 (ϕ = 0.089), and P85 (ϕ = 0.098)
signifies the greater D2O penetration in the hydrophilic
corona and core region of these hydrophilic pluronics (F108 and F127).44 Various key parameters from the model for the
SANS measurements viz. core radius (Rc), polydispersity, hard sphere radius (RHS), volume fraction (ϕ), and aggregation number (Nagg) are tabulated in Table 1. The increase in temperature from 37 to
47 °C and 57 °C persuades the increase of the core radius
(Rc) and the aggregation number (Nagg). There is evidence to suggest a decrease
in the hard sphere radius of hydrophilic pluronics (F108 and F127)
when temperatures increased from 37 to 57 °C, conferring the
removal of water from the corona region. Increase in the hard sphere
radius of the hydrophobic pluronics (P84 and P85) as increase in the
temperature (37–57 °C) is due to the increase in the aggregation
numbers of these hydrophobic pluronics. In the case of pluronic P84,
volume fraction (ϕ) decreases as the temperature is increased.
At 37 °C, the volume fraction (ϕ) was 0.089 and this falls
to (ϕ) = 0.081 at 47 °C and (ϕ) = 0.060 at 57 °C.
A similar decrease was also observed in the other investigated pluronics
except F68. The unimers of F68 converted into the micelle with volume
fraction (ϕ) = 0.065 at 47 °C, and at 57 °C, aggregation
of these micelles was increased but volume fraction was also increased
from (ϕ) = 0.065–0.140. The volume fraction of F68 micelles
increases, and the dehydrating effects of the rise of temperature
can be ascribed to the transformation of remaining F68 unimers to
contribute to form more micelles.45 At
57 °C, pluronic P84 with 40% PEO content converted from spherical
micelles to prolate ellipsoidal micelles. The correlation peak tends
to be weak in the scattering curve at 57 °C and cannot be explained
employing a spherical shape micelles-based model.46,47 At higher temperature, the aggregation number (Nagg) increases, Nagg ≈
159 at 37 °C to Nagg ≈ 203
at 47 °C and Nagg ≈ 403 at
57 °C, leading to an increase in the micelle core radius. When
the length of the core region exceeds the stretched length of the
PEO corona region of the pluronic micelles, it tends to shape conversion
from spherical to prolate ellipsoidal micelles. It is reported in
the literature that when the temperature increases, the aspect ratio
also increases, which results in anisotropic growth and change in
morphology of micelles to worm-like and cylindrical structures.48,49

Another important reason
behind this kind of behavior is change
in the PEO region into a less polar form with increase in temperature;
moreover, PEO region of the P84 micelle interacts less favorably with
water molecules. A weak interaction between the PEO region and water
molecules at 57 °C results in the higher packing density at the
PEP–PPO–PEO interface, which favors the morphological
conversion of spherical pluronic micelles to prolate ellipsoidal micelles.47 The results showed no structural transformations
of other pluronics due to insignificant increase in the aggregation
number (Nagg). In case of pluronic P85
with 50% PEO content, Nagg ≈ 98
at 37 °C to Nagg ≈ 122 at
47 °C and Nagg ≈ 145 at 57
°C, in pluronic F127 with 70% PEO content, Nagg ≈ 108 at 37 °C to Nagg ≈ 130 at 47 °C and Nagg ≈ 141 at 57 °C, in pluronic F108 with 80% PEO content Nagg ≈ 96 at 37 °C to Nagg ≈ 132 at 47 °C and Nagg ≈ 173 at 57 °C, in pluronic F68 with 80% PEO
content Nagg ≈ 11 at 47 °C
to Nagg ≈ 88 at 57 °C. A decrease
in the interactions between water and pluronic P84 on an increase
in temperature was the main reason for the increase in the aggregation
number. Instead of the longer corona region of the other
investigated micelles enable to retain the interactions of pluronics
with water.

Scattering curves of pluronics P84 and F68 in the
presence of LAM
are shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively; pluronic P85, F127, and F108 in the presence of
LAM are presented in Figure S8a–c (Supporting Information), respectively. The scattering data from solutions
of all pluronic micelles show features that are observed in the absence
of the LAM drug. The SANS results evidenced no change in the scattering
features in the presence of LAM. However, in the absence of LAM, the
scattering intensity decreased at low values of q region, when compared to data from pluronic micelles, in the presence
of LAM. However in the absence of LAM, the scattering intensity decreased
at low values of q region, when compared to data
from pluronic micelles. These observations indicate that the drug
affects either the aggregation number or size but does not affect
the shape of pluronic micelles. SANS experiments on micellar solutions
in the presence of LAM suggest that the number density of micelles
increases as the pluronic micelle aggregation number decreases. This
may be attributed to the rise in the micellar volume fraction due
to the presence of the hydrophobic drug LAM.50 Upon the addition of LAM, the size of cores and the coronas of the
micelles increased; the values are tabulated in Table 1. A significant decrease in the aggregation
number of the pluronic micelles indicates that in the presence of
the LAM drug, micelle formation occurred even at lesser pluronic monomers.
The concentration of pluronic F108, F127, P85, and P84 are above the
cmc values; in fact, the remaining monomers of pluronics participate
in the formation of new micelles. Prescott et al. also explored the
effect of addition of flurbiprofen drug, cosolvent, and temperature
on the pluronic micellization using SANS measurements. The scattering
pattern obtained from SANS measurements revealed the attractive interactions
in the micelles and/or the morphological change in the micelles at
the higher flurbiprofen concentrations (1% w/v). These results demonstrate
that these important factors must be considered carefully for clinical
or industrial applications, such as effect of various environmental
conditions, including the presence of cosolvent, temperature, hydrophobic
species, such as drug molecules, impurities, and hydrophobicity of
the pluronics on the micellization of pluronics.51

P84 and (b) F68, 5% w/v in the absence and presence of LAM drug 37,
47, and 57 °C.

2.4 HTM Measurements
The working temperature
range was chosen on the basis of the morphological transitions observed
in pluronic micelles with SANS measurements. The heat transfer resistance, Rth, was calculated using eq 4 given below 4  Here, T1 and T2 is the temperature
of the copper block and
temperature measured by the thermocouple that is placed in the liquid
at 1.7 mm above the copper black, and P is the power
applied. Rth measurements of pluronic
P84 and pluronic F127 are displayed in Figure 7a,b, respectively.

profiles of pluronic micelles at variable
temperature (a) P84 and (b) F127 (c) P84 in the preseance of the LAM
drug (d) F127 in the presence of the LAM drug.

The noise in the Rth signal is
due
to small fluctuations of the power input related to the PID controller.
It is noteworthy that irreversible changes on the electrode surface
are observed as a decrease in the Rth upon
heating. Moreover, the temperatures at which the Rth drops are detected correspond well to the main phase-transition
temperature observed by the SANS measurement: the pretransitional
behavior starts at 55.0 °C, and the transition is finished at
58 °C (Figure 7a), intimating that the modification in Rth correlates to a phase change between spherical micelles and the
prolate ellipsoidal micellar states upon heating (Rth value). At the temperature where morphological changes
occur (spherical micelles to prolate ellipsoidal micelles), there
is decrease in the surface area of the micelles due to the elongated
structure that increase the movement of the current resulting in the
decrease in the thermal resistance value. There are no additional
morphological changes observed in the next temperature cycle. In the
case of pluronic F127, there is a continuous decrease in the Rth upon heating, whereas the Rth increased to the same value upon cooling. In this case,
there is no drop in the Rth value, confirming
that there are no morphological changes occurring on the surface.
The LAM--loaded pluronic P84 micelles shown in Figure 7c demonstrate a drop in the Rth starting at 52 °C in the first heating cycle that
ends at 58 °C, which is not observed in any later heating and
cooling cycles. When comparing the temperature at which transition
starts between the LAM-loaded pluronic P84 micelles and unloaded pluronic
P84, there is a difference of 3 °C, favoring the morphological
changes to occur at a lower transition temperature in the presence
of LAM. LAM-loaded F127 micelles (Figure 7d) also does not show any significant difference
in the Rth value, which corresponds to
a consistent morphology of the micelles.

2.5 In Vitro
Drug Release
The release
of LAM from pluronic formulations at 37 and 57 °C is presented
in Figure 8a,b, respectively.
The figure depicts that the drug release starts with an initial burst
followed by a slow release of LAM from the formulations prepared at
37 °C was 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.5 h faster than formulations prepared
at 57 °C in pluronic P84, P85, F127, and F108, respectively.
LAM-loaded hydrophilic pluronics of F108 and F127 that are prepared
at 37 °C showed 100% drug release in 2 and 2.5 h, respectively.
However, a slower release rate was seen in the case of loaded hydrophobic
pluronics P84 and P85 as they showed 90% LAM release in 4.5 and 5
h, respectively, because most of the LAM was solubilized in the core
of these micelles. Five different models, viz. zero-order kinetics,
first-order kinetics, Higuchi kinetics, the Hixson–Crowell
model, and the KP model, were used to evaluate the data of drug release.52 The most fitted model was selected based on
comparing the coefficient of determination. To find the release phenomenon
of LAM from the pluronic micelles, correlation coefficient and rate
constant were computed for all five models. From the R2 values, it was ascertained that for the LAM release
profiles of formulations solubilized at 37 °C, the best fit model
was the Hixson model for all pluronic micelles, except the F108 micelle
for which the best fitted model was KP model; the values are tabulated
in Table 2. According
to the KP equation, 0.5 ≤ n (diffusional coefficient)
is described with a Fickian diffusion mechanism, 0.5 < n < 1.0 anomalous (non-Fickian) diffusion, 1.0 = n case II transport, and n > 1.0 with
super
case II transport.53,54 The diffusional coefficient (n) value less than 0.5 in case of F108 suggested that the
release follows the Fickian diffusion. Whereas in case of the formulations
solubilized at 57 °C, the best-fitted model was KP for all pluronic
micelles except F127 micelles, which followed the Hixson model values,
which are tabulated in Table 3. The value of n observed in the best fitted model for F68,
F108, P85, and P84 pluronic micelles was observed to be more than
0.5, indicating anomalous (non-Fickian) diffusion.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have presented LAM solubilization in five different
pluronics, viz. P84, P85, F127, F108, and F68, using UV–visible
spectroscopy. The solubilization in all pluronics was enhanced by
increasing the temperature, which changes the polarity of the micelles
leading to dehydration and an increase in the aggregation number.
Different solubilization parameters such as the drug loading capacity,
partition coefficient, and standard free energy of solubilization
(ΔG°) were determined. Among all investigated
pluronics, P84 has the best solubilization capacity in the temperature
range, 37–57 °C. SANS experiments revealed that pluronic
P84 micelles converted in prolate ellipsoidal micelles from spherical
micelles at 57 °C. This was confirmed by DLS and HTM and is due
to higher hydrophobicity of P84 compared to other investigated pluronics.
The SANS results showed that the aggregation number increases in hydrophobic
pluronic P84 as the temperature is increased and that is the driving
force for the morphological changes in the micelles. HTM results revealed
that the conversion of the spherical micelles to prolate ellipsoidal
micelles starts at 55 °C and ends at 58 °C. However, the
hydrophilic pluronic F127 does not show any significant change in
the Rth value, confirming that no morphological
changes occur as a function of temperature. In vitro drug release
revealed that the release behavior of LAM can be modulated by simply
changing the temperature for preparation of pluronic micelle formulation.
Therefore, this work opens many new areas to modulate the drug-loading
capacity of the hydrophobic drug in the different pluronic micelles
by varying the temperature and drug release behavior. For the first
time, we have reported the use of HTM to determine morphological changes
of thermoresponsive micelles.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Pluronics P84, P85, F127,
F108, F68, and LAM, with purities of ≥98% were procured from
Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and
used without any further purification. For the preparation of solutions,
double distilled water was used.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Solubilization Study of LAM Drug
To investigate the
solubilization capacity, preweighed amounts of
LAM were added to the vials containing 5 mL of different pluronic
P84, P85, F127, F108, and F68 micellar media. The sample vials were
stirred at a temperature of 37, 47, and 57 ± 0.1 °C for
12 h after which they were filtered using a millipore filter (0.20
μm) to remove the LAM that did not dissolve in the micelles.
The concentration of solubilized LAM in the micelles was determined
using a Shimadzu (UV-1800) UV–vis double beam spectrophotometer.
The λmax of LAM was found to be 303 nm. Molar absorption
coefficient of LAM was 5.9832 × 103 L mol–1 cm–1 as calculated from the calibration curve.
The pluronic concentration was kept the same in both the reference
and the measurement cell to eliminate the effect of the pluronics
on the UV absorbance. Molar absorption coefficient has been used to
determine the amount of LAM solubilized in the pluronic micelles.

4.2.2 DLS Measurements
The hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) of pluronic micelles in
the presence and absence of LAM was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer
Nanoseries Nano-ZS instrument equipped with He–Ne laser (λ
= 632.8 nm) at 37, 47, and 57 ± 0.1 °C at a scattering angle
of 173°. All samples were filtered with millipore filter (0.20
μm) to avoid the interference of contaminants.

4.2.3 SANS Measurements
The SANS measurements
were carried out on an indigenously built SANS instrument operating
at the Dhruva reactor, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai,
India.24,25 The mean wavelength of the monochromatized
beam was 5.2 Å–1 [wavelength resolution (Δλ/λ)
of approximately 15%] and was equipped with a linear position sensitive
detector (angular range 0.5–15°). These were used to impart
Q-range from 0.018 to 0.32 Å–1. All sample
measurements were carried out at 37, 47, and 57 ± 0.1 °C.
Theoretical details regarding the SANS measurements are provided as
Annexure SI (Supporting Information).

4.2.4 HTM Measurements
For the HTM measurements,
⟨111⟩ p-type silica electrodes from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham,
United Kingdom) were functionalized with 100 μL of a micelle
solution. Subsequently, these electrodes were dried at 50.0 ±
0.1 °C for 30 min and mounted on the flow cell shown in Scheme 2, as per the flow
cell design described in ref (26). After stabilizing for 30 min at 35 °C in a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution, the temperature was increased to 70 °C
and subsequently cooled down to the starting temperature using a constant
heating or cooling rate of 11.67 °C/h. Three of these temperature
cycles were performed and after the final run, the solution was kept
at 35 °C for 30 min.

4.2.5 In
Vitro LAM Release from Pluronic Micelles
In vitro release
profiles of LAM from different micelles were evaluated
using the dialysis release method. A solution of LAM-loaded pluronic
micelles (2 mL) was introduced into a dialysis membrane bag (Himedia,
molecular weight cut off between 12 000 and 14 000)
and submerged into 100 mL of a PBS solution (pH = 7.4), which acts
as release medium to create a concentration gradient. The dialysis
release system was maintained at 37 °C with constant stirring
at 250 rpm. Samples were taken from the release medium at regular
specified time intervals, and the media was replenished with the same
volume of fresh release media. The collected samples were filtered
with 0.20 μm filters before determining the amount of LAM release
using a spectrophotometer.
