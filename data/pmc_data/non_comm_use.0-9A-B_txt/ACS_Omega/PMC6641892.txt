A novel approach for synthesizing
chalcones by Pd-catalyzed oxidative
coupling is described. This is the first report of the efficient coupling
reaction of acetanilides with phenyl vinyl ketones under mild conditions.
Selective C–H activation occurred next to the acetamide group

Introduction
Chalcones are one of
the most popular compounds in plants, such
as vegetables, fruits, teas, and so on, and have various pharmacological
activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antimalarial, and
antitumor activities.1 Chalcone skeletons
are not only used as privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry but
also used for their fluorescent property. In addition, chalcone is
the precursor of flavonoids in biosynthesis2 as well as various heterocyclic compounds through chemical transformation.3 Flavonoids are also important naturally occurring
compound classified as polyphenols, and some flavonoids are known
as colored compounds, anthocyanins.2 Thus,
chalcones are widely utilized in a variety of fields, and therefore,
many methods of synthesizing chalcones have been reported.1a,1d Aldol condensation methods, including Claisen–Schmidt reactions
and Wittig reactions, are classic representative methods for synthesizing
chalcone skeletons (Scheme 1). However, some functionalized chalcones are difficult to
synthesize and require several steps.

Scheme 1 General Method for
the Synthesis of Chalcones
We are interested in the reaction of hypervalent iodine
reagents
with chalcones and have studied the transformation of the acetals
obtained from the rearrangement of N-protected aminochalcones
into heterocyclic compounds such as indoles and quinolines.4 However, in these syntheses, the synthesis of N-protected aminochalcones is problematic. The synthesis
of 2-aminobenzaldehydes, the precursors of 2-aminochalcone in Claisen–Schmidt
or Wittig reactions, is challenging in terms of the number of steps,
selectivity of reaction, and yields. For example, we attempted to
synthesize 2-amino-4-methoxybenzaldehyde derivatives from inexpensive
3-methoxyaniline derivative by the introduction of formyl groups with
the Friedel–Crafts reaction or direct formylation, resulting
in poor selectivity. Then, we chose rather expensive 2-nitro-3-methoxybenzaldehyde
as a starting material. However, a similar problem such as selectivity
in the synthesis or less commercial availability should occur in syntheses
of other derivatives. We then explored a more convenient approach
for synthesizing 2-aminochalcones without using 2-aminobenzaldehydes
as a starting material. Cross-coupling reactions are powerful tools
for the synthesis of various biaryl and related compounds.5 Particularly, direct arylation or allylation
of the nonfunctionalized position using a directing group is a convenient
method for making such compounds in few steps. Many methods for the
synthesis of biaryls by direct arylation using a directing group have
been reported.6 Direct allylation of aniline
derivatives has also been reported,6e,6g,6i but most studies have employed acrylates as a coupling
partner; few have used vinyl ketones such as phenyl vinyl ketone,
the precursor of chalcones.7

Results and Discussion
We first examined the oxidative coupling reaction of 3-methoxyacetanilide 1a with 4-methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone 2a using
Pd(OAc)2 and K2S2O8 as
co-oxidants under an O2 atmosphere with reference to Youn’s
method.7a The reaction proceeded but the
yield of the corresponding chalcone 3a was 24% (Table 1, entry 1). The desired
coupling reaction proceeded by employing Cu(OAc)2 as a
co-oxidant, resulting in 3a at a 32% yield (entry 3).
Using Pd(OCOCF3)2 instead of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst, 3a was obtained at 41% yield without
using CF3COOH as a solvent (entry 4). Increasing the amount
of Pd(OCOCF3)2 to 20 mol % yielded the compound
at 82% yield (entry 5).

Next, we reacted nonsubstituted acetanilide 1b under
the above conditions (Table 2), and 3b was obtained at only 16% yield even
at 50 °C (entry 2). We reexamined the reaction conditions and
observed that the use of CF3COOH as a co-solvent enhanced
the reaction even at room temperature (entries 8–12), and a
9:1 ratio of (CH2Cl)2–CF3COOH
and higher concentration gave the best yield (57%) (entry 11). Surprisingly,
in the absence of Cu(OAc)2, the reaction proceeded at a
yield (55%) similar to that in the presence of Cu(OAc)2 (57%) under the O2 atmosphere (entries 12 and 11).8

Next, we explored the substrate scope of direct coupling reactions
between acetanilides and 4-methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone for the synthesis
of chalcones (Table 3). 3-methoxyacetanilide 1a yielded the corresponding
chalcone 3a, but the yield was 42% under these conditions
(entry 2). On the basis of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analyses,
4-methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone 2a was consumed rapidly
and acetanilide 1a remained after the consumption of 2a. Then, we applied the slow addition of 2a using
a syringe pump and the yield improved up to 85% over 8 h and the by-product
generated from 2a was decreased (entry 3); this process
was employed for further investigation. 3,4-Dimethoxyacetanilide 1c was reacted with 4-methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone 2a under the conditions above, affording the corresponding 2-aminochalcone 3c at high yield (94%) (entry 4). However, other electron-rich
acetanilides, 4-methoxyacetanilide 1d and 2-methoxyacetanilide 1e, resulted in moderate-to-low yields (49 and 18%, respectively)
(entries 5 and 6). It should be noted that the acetanilide 1f bearing Cl atom on the aromatic ring proceeded the desired coupling
reaction affording 3f in 82% yield without any cross-coupling
reaction product at the position of Cl atom (entry 7). On the other
hand, 3-methylacetanilide 1g gave the corresponding 2-aminochalcone 3g at good yield (68%) (entry 8). These results indicate that
the electron-donating effect on the ortho position of the acetamide
group is important for this reaction. 3-Chloroacetanilide 1h underwent the coupling reaction but the yield was 25% (entry 9).
In the case of 3-nitroacetanilide 1i, no corresponding
chalcone 3i was obtained even at 50 °C owing to
its strong electron-withdrawing property (entry 10).

Table 3 Pd-Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of
Various Acetanilides with 4-Methoxyphenyl Vinyl Ketone
a A solution of 2a in
(CH2Cl)2 was added for 8 h via a syringe pump
to the solution of acetanilide 1 in (CH2Cl)2–CF3COOH.

b No reaction.

Next, we examined the scope of phenyl vinyl ketones employing the
same conditions used in Table 3 (Table 4).
The coupling reaction of 3-methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone 2b with 1a afforded the corresponding chalcone 3j at 51% yield (entry 2). In the case of 2-methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone 2c, a better result was obtained using the optimized conditions
shown in Table 1 [Pd(OCOCF3)2 and Cu(OAc)2 in (CH2Cl)2], affording the corresponding chalcone 3k at
60% yield and the poor result was obtained under the conditions used
in Table 3 (entry 3).
Next, the nonsubstituted phenyl vinyl ketone 2d was reacted
with 1a to give 3l in 44% yield but afforded
at good yield (74%) using the conditions shown in Table 1 (entry 4). The reaction of
4-tolyl vinyl ketone 2e with 1a proceeded
at moderate yield (58%) (entry 5). As an electron-withdrawing group,
the reaction with 4-chlorophenyl vinyl ketone 2f afforded 3n at 73% yield (entry 6). The more electron-deficient 4-nitrophenyl
vinyl ketone 2g also underwent the coupling reaction
at 49% yield (entry 7). Methyl vinyl ketone 2h was also
reacted to give the corresponding coupling product 3p in 51% yield, which was improved to 79% yield employing the conditions
indicated in Table 1 (entry 8).

Table 4 Pd-Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of
Various Phenyl Vinyl Ketones with 3-Methoxyacetanilide
a Reactions were conducted in (CH2Cl)2 (0.5 M) with Pd(OCOCF3)2 (20 mol %)
and Cu(OAc)2 (20 mol %), and the yield is
indicated in the parenthesis.

Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions of acetanilide and phenyl vinyl
ketone should proceed via a C–H activation mechanism, and a
plausible reaction mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 2. First, Pd(II) was inserted into the C–H
bond of the ortho position of the acetamide group, producing the monomeric
or dimeric cyclopalladation species coordinated by the oxygen of acetamide.
Then, coordination of the olefin followed by insertion to the double
bond led to the carbopalladated species. β-Hydride elimination
took place to afford the aminochalcone derivative, where the generated
Pd(0) was reoxidized under an O2 atmosphere to give Pd(II).
An alternative pathway involving the Pd(II)/Pd(IV) cycle cannot be
ruled out.9 Although it is not clear why
no chemical oxidant is needed for the reaction, the combination of
substrates may affect the oxidation of Pd(0).

Mechanism for Pd-Catalyzed Direct Coupling of
Acetanilides and Phenyl Vinyl Ketones
Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed a new convenient
method of synthesizing
2-aminochalcones. This is the first report of the Pd-catalyzed direct
cross-coupling reaction of acetanilides and phenyl vinyl ketones.
A variety of acetanilides, except for those with a strong electron-withdrawing
substituent, were susceptible to this reaction, as well as various
vinyl ketones. It is noteworthy that no chemical co-oxidant was necessary
in this reaction, and atmospheric O2 was a sufficient co-oxidant.
We believe that our method offers a new and easy way to synthesize
aminochalcones.

Experimental Section
General Information
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on
a 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with
tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift in ppm (δ),
multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet,
m = multiplet, brs = broad singlet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration.
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a double-focusing
mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI). Unless otherwise
noted, all reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers
and used without further purification. Each regioisomer exhibited
similar Rf values on TLC plates run with
various solvents. Some could not be separated from the primary reaction
product and remained as a mixture. In mixed samples, the ratio of
regioisomer was determined by 1H NMR; pure data were obtained
for those regioisomers that could be isolated.

General Procedure for Conducting
Pd-Catalyzed Coupling Reactions
of Acetanilides and 4-Methoxyphenyl vinyl ketone (Table 3)
Typical Procedure from 1a and 2a to 3a (Method A) (Table 3, Entry 3)
Pd(OCOCF3)2 (33
mg, 0.1 mmol) and CF3COOH (0.025 mL) were added to a solution
of acetanilide 1a (83 mg, 0.5 mmol) in (CH2Cl)2 (0.225 mL), and then, the inside of the reaction
flask was replaced with O2. A solution of phenyl vinyl
ketone 2a (122 mg, 0.75 mmol) in (CH2Cl)2 (0.1 mL) was added via a syringe pump over 8 h. The resulting
solution was stirred at room temperature under the O2 atmosphere
(O2 balloon) for an additional 16 h (total 24 h). Saturated
aqueous NaHCO3 was added to the resultant solution, and
the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic
layer was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated in
vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography on a silica
gel (CH2Cl2/AcOEt = 5/1) to give 3a (138 mg, 85%).

Typical Procedure from 1a and 2c to 3k (Method B) (Table 4, Entry 3)
A solution of Pd(OCOCF3)2 (33 mg, 0.1 mmol), Cu(OAc)2 (18 mg,
0.1 mmol),
and 2c (122 mg, 0.75 mmol) in (CH2Cl)2 (0.5 mL) was added to a solution of phenyl vinyl ketone 1a (83 mg, 0.5 mmol) in (CH2Cl)2 (0.5
mL), and then, the inside of the reaction flask was replaced with
O2. The resulting solution was stirred for 24 h and evaporated
in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography on a silica
gel (CH2Cl2/AcOEt = 5/1) to give 3k (98 mg, 60%).
