Graphene
spheres confining fullerene C60 are quantitatively
formed under high-shear and continuous-flow processing using a vortex
fluidic device (VFD). This involves intense micromixing a colloidal
suspension of graphite in DMF and an o-xylene solution
of C60 at room temperature in the absence of surfactants
and other auxiliary substances. The diameters of the composite spheres,
C60@graphene, can be controlled with size distributions
ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 μm, depending on the VFD operating parameters,
including rotational speed, flow rate, relative ratio of C60 to graphite, and the concentration of fullerene. An electrode of
the composite material has high cycle stability, with a high areal
capacitance of 103.4 mF cm–2, maintaining its capacitances
to 24.7 F g–1 and 86.4 mF cm–2 (83.5%) at a high scan rate of 100 mV s–1.

Introduction
Carbon nanomaterials
have emerged as key materials for future technology,
for developing complex functional structures devoid of potentially
toxic metals and metals, which are likely to have supply chain issues
in the near future.1 Graphene, as a single
2D planar sheet of graphite arranged in a hexagonal lattice,2 is one of the newest forms of such nanomaterials.
It has remarkable chemical, physical, and electrical properties, with
high conductivity in the absence of defects and wrinkles, large specific
surface area, and excellent mechanical flexibility,1,3 and
features in a growing number of applications. These include batteries,
supercapacitors, catalyst supports, drug delivery, electrode materials
for energy storage devices, membranes, biomedical devices, and coatings,
and these relate to its multifarious and interdisciplinary properties.1,3−7

Graphene can be transformed into other structures including
0D
nanoparticles (carbon dots), 1D nanofibers (carbon nanofibers and
nanotubes), 2D nanosheets (graphene oxide), 3D nanostructures (hollow
carbon nanospheres), fullerenes, and composites of these.8−11 Among these different carbon nanomaterials, graphene spheres show
promise in a wide range of applications covering energy storage including
lithium ion batteries, separation systems, oxygen-reduction, catalyst
supports, nanoreactors, and adsorption.12−21

The synthesis of graphene spheres with smooth surfaces and
uniform
sizes uses soft template processing,22 hard
templating (silicon template),23 solvothermal
techniques,24 sol pyrolysis,25 microemulsion polymerization,26 hydrothermal reduction,27,28 and gelation.29 Related to this are extended oxidation strategies
to alter the morphology and surface topography of graphene oxide (GO)
nanosheets, as a potential route to build up 3D graphene architectures.30,31 However, the synthetic strategies for gaining access to such architectures
are limited by the high cost of production, the use of harsh chemicals
or surfactants, high temperature processing as a high-energy penalty,
and limited scope for scaling up the process.5 A challenge is to develop a scalable, low-cost method that is high
in green chemistry or sustainability metrics, for gaining access to
3D graphene-based materials, including graphene spheres and composites
thereof.

To this end, we have explored the use of continuous-flow
processing
to prepare graphene spheres and graphene-fullerene composite spheres
directly from graphite and fullerene C60, at room temperature,
avoiding the use of auxiliary reagents. This involved the use of the
in-house developed continuous-flow vortex fluidic device (VFD), which
was developed early this decade.4 It is
a versatile microfluidic platform containing a dynamic thin film,
in contrast to traditional channel based microfluidics, which can
suffer from clogging. Mechanoenergy is delivered into the liquid in
the VFD in a controlled way.4 Under continuous-flow
VFD processing, jet feeds deliver solution into an inclined rapidly
rotating tube, opened at one end and usually housing a glass or quartz
tube of 20 mm outside diameter (OD) and 16.000 ± 0.013 mm internal
diameter (ID) (Figure 1),32 with the liquid whirling up and out
of the tube. In the confined mode of operation of the VFD, a finite
volume of liquid is processed in the tube, and this is effective in
processing small volumes of liquid as well as a proven method for
exploring the operating parameter space of the VFD for a particular
process prior to extending the process into continuous flow.33

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the overall method for fabricating
the
composite spheres under shear stress in a vortex fluidic device (VFD),
using a 1:1 mixture of (a) an o-xylene solution of
C60 and (b) a suspension of graphite in DMF, with the optimized
conditions at a rotational speed (ω) = 4k rpm under continuous-flow
conditions, (c) flow rate (ν̇) = 0.5 mL min–1, θ = 45°, concentration of graphite in DMF 1 mg mL–1, and concentration of C60 in o-xylene 0.5 mg mL–1, and (d) the resulting composite
spheres.

The versatile VFD has a number
of remarkable applications, encompassing
probing the structure of self-organized systems, material processing,
controlling chemical reactivity and selectivity, including enhancing
enzymatic reactions, and more.34 The first
publication reporting the VFD was in 2012, describing the exfoliation
of graphite along with hexagonal boron nitride, using the confined
mode of operation of the device.35 Since
then, other forms of carbon have been fabricated in the device, including
toroidal structures of self-assembled single walled carbon nanotubes,36 laser aided slicing of single and multiwalled
carbon nanotubes,37 the formation of carbon
dots (from multiwalled carbon nanotubes),33 controlling the self-assembly of fullerene C60 molecules
into nanotubules using water as an the antisolvent,32 and the fabrication of fullerene C60 cones in
a 1:1 mixture of o-xylene and DMF.38 The VFD is also effective in controlling the nucleation
and growth of palladium nanoparticles on graphene,39 decorating palladium nanoparticles on carbon nano-onions,40 and transforming graphene oxide into graphene
oxide scrolls.41

We report a facile
room temperature one-step synthesis of graphene
spheres confining fullerene C60, directly from graphite
dispersed in DMF and an o-xylene solution of the
fullerene. Remarkably, the composite material, C60@graphene,
is formed quantitatively with respect to graphite, with the ability
to tune the size of the spheres while avoiding using auxiliary substances
such as surfactants, which can affect surface properties of the resulting
nanomaterials. To demonstrate an application of C60@graphene,
its supercapacitor performance was evaluated using the spheres as
electrodes, which delivered a gravimetric capacitance of 29.5 F g–1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. While
other types of graphene can reach such capacitance up to 250 F g–1,42−45 the C60@graphene electrode has an areal capacitance of
103.4 mF cm–2, which is higher than values for other
carbon derivatives, for example, in GF-CNT@Fe2O3 (53.56 mF/cm2 at 10 mA/cm2).46 Moreover, the device reported herein can maintain its capacitances
to 24.7 F g–1 and 86.4 mF cm–2 (83.5%) at a high scan rate of 100 mV s–1, establishing
a high rate capability of the graphene sphere electrode and potential
of the material in the next-generation energy storage devices.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Chemicals
Graphite flakes of 99% purity
were suspended in 99.5% dimethyformamide (DMF), and fullerene C60 (99.5% purity) was dissolved in o-xylene,
with both materials and solvents purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

Sample
Preparation and Materials Synthesis
Suspensions
of graphite in DMF were prepared at different concentrations, namely,
1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mg mL–1, and then sonicated for
15 min followed by centrifugation for 30 min to remove undispersed
graphite. Solutions of fullerene C60 were prepared in o-xylene at different concentrations, namely, 0.5, 1, 1.5,
and 2 mg mL–1. Initially, as-received fullerene
was added to o-xylene, and the mixture was allowed
to stand at room temperature for 24 h, whereupon it was filtered (60
μm filter paper) to remove undissolved particles before mixing
with graphite dispersed in DMF in the VFD using different jet feeds
(Figure 1). Operating
parameter space for the VFD was systematically explored, in particular
the rotational speed of the rapidly rotating glass tube, concentrations
of graphite and fullerenes, flow rate, and ratio of the two solvents.
After VFD processing, the resulting carbon material was collected
via centrifugation at g = 1.751 rfc for 20 min.

Characterization
Samples of C60@graphene
on silicon wafers were prepared by drop casting followed by evaporation
under ambient conditions. The morphology, size, and shape of the particles
and their properties were studied using a number of complementary
techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV, operating at 10 mm working distance, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) conducted on a TECNAI 20 microscope operated
at 120 and 200 kV, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the data collected
using a Bruker ADVANCE D8 ECO, Co Kα, at an operating wavelength
of 1.7988 Å with 2θ varied from 10 to 80°. Samples
of the as-prepared material were formed by drying them in nitrogen
at 55 °C for 3 days. They were then stored and kept at room temperature
for 48 h. Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm structure integrity
of the as-prepared carbon materials, with the spectra recorded using
a Horiba XploRA apparatus at a fixed wavelength of 532 nm.

Electrochemical
Characterization and Supercapacitor Fabrication
To fabricate
the supercapacitors, the active material was mixed
with carbon black and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in a mass ratio
of 80:10:10. The resulting paste was pressed and attached to platinum
foils as the current collectors, between which a piece of filter paper
was sandwiched as a separator and 1.0 M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. All electrochemical tests including
cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (CD), and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out using
a two-electrode cell configuration by a CHI 760C electrochemical workstation.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication of C60@Graphene Spheres
Conventional
methods for fabricating graphene/carbon spheres require complex multistep
procedures, which are typically nonscalable. We find that a graphene-fullerene
C60 composite is readily prepared in the VFD in the absence
of other reagents and importantly in quantitative yield relative to
graphite with the processing illustrated in Figure 1a. Under continuous-flow mode of operation
in the VFD, one jet feed delivered an o-xylene solution
of C60, with another jet feed delivering a suspension of
graphite in DMF, both to the hemispherical base of the rapidly rotating
glass tube. The operating parameters of the VFD were systematically
varied to form the optimal product, as the most uniform in terms of
morphology, size, and shape distributions of the spheres and highest
yield. For this, the rotational speed was 4k rpm, the tilt angle of
the glass tube θ was 45°, the concentration of C60 in o-xylene was 0.5 mg mL–1,
the concentration of graphite in DMF was 1 mg mL–1, with a 1:1 ratio of the two solvents, and the flow rate for both
liquids was 0.5 mL min–1. The tilt angle of the
tube in the VFD was fixed at 45°, where there is unique complex
fluid dynamics, which is the optimized angle for a plethora of processing
applications of the device.4

Mechanism of
Formation of the Composite Spheres
Intense
micromixing DMF with o-xylene in a 1:1 ratio in the
absence of graphite results in the formation of cones composed of
approximately 0.5 to 2.5 μm diameter self-assembled particles
of C60, also under continuous-flow conditions and with
the optimal rotational speed also at 4k rpm.38 As in the present study, the DMF acts as an antisolvent, resulting
in the formation of nanoparticles of the fullerene, which are likely
to adhere to the surface of the graphite flakes (Figure 2a), facilitating exfoliation
by leveraging the graphene layers, which then wrap up the fullerene
particles under high shear (Figure 2b). Then the process starts again on the resulting
exposed graphene surface once a certain threshold of fullerene particles
adheres to the surface and so on. This accounts for the fullerene
particles being primarily confined within an outer layer of graphene
sheets (Figure 2c).
Processing in the absence of C60 (for a 1:1 mixture of o-xylene and DMF) affords exfoliated graphene, whereas the
same processing for C60 in the absence of graphite results
in the formation of particles of the fullerene <100 nm (Figure S1), which importantly are similar to
the size of the fullerene particles present within the spheres. These
were determined by sonicating the isolated spheres in DMF for 30 min
(Figure 2d), with the
resulting ruptured spheres containing particles of C60 in
the range of 5 to 100 nm. These findings give credence to the proposed
mechanism of the formation of particles of C60 adhering
to the exposed graphene surface of graphite, presumably favored by
π–π interactions between the two components. These
are then transformed into spheres comprising at most a few layers
of graphene, with the number of sheets of stacked graphene limited
by the mechanical energy imparted in the dynamic thin film in the
device.

Morphology of the C60@Graphene Spheres
SEM
images of different magnification of graphene sphere composites, formed
under the above optimized conditions, are shown in Figure 3, along with a size distribution
(inset, centered at 3.5 μm). The particles are regular spheres
with smooth surfaces and are not highly aggregated. The spheres were
also examined using TEM (Figure 4a,b), which revealed small particles of C60 ∼10 to 50 nm in diameter attached to the surface of the composite
materials and other nanoparticles of comparable size unattached, with
C60 particles on the inside. The presence of C60 particles on the surface of the spheres and inside the spheres is
in accordance with the observation by SEM (Figure 3). The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 4c,d) reveals that
the graphene spheres have some C60 particles on the surface
of the spheres as well as inside them.

Figure 3 (a–e) SEM images
(from lower magnification to higher magnification)
of C60@graphene, with a size distribution (inset), formed
in o-xylene and DMF, under continuous-flow mode at
a 1:1 ratio (ω = 7.5k rpm, concentration of C60 in o-xylene 0.5 mg mL–1, concentration of
graphite in DMF 1 mg mL–1, flow rate ν̇
= 0.5 mL min–1 for both liquids entering the rotating
tube in the VFD, and θ = 45°).

spheres formed in o-xylene and DMF, under continuous-flow
mode at a 1:1 ratio at 4k rpm, concentration of fullerenes C60 in o-xylene 0.5 mg mL–1, concentration
of graphite in DMF 1 mg mL–1, flow rate 0.5 mL min–1 for both liquids entering the rotating tube in the
VFD, and θ = 45°.

We found that the morphology, size, and shape of the spheres varied
on changing the rotational speed, flow rate of both liquids, and changing
the concentrations of graphite and fullerene, as established using
SEM. The optimized speed for generating smooth spheres was 4k rpm
(Figure 3a–e).
At much higher speed, 7.5k rpm, with the other parameters unchanged,
the surfaces of the spheres are textured, but remarkably, the spheres
now have a hole connecting the outer surface and inner surface of
the tube (Figure S5). At 6k and 9k rpm,
with the other parameters unchanged, the surfaces of the spheres are
also textured and nonuniform (Figures S4 and S6). The ratio of the two solutions delivered to the VFD tube was initially
set at 1:1, which was based on the success of this ratio in forming
the fullerene cones38 of comparable diameter
to the spheres in the present study, the only difference being the
absence of graphite. The initial flow rate of both solutions was fixed
at 0.5 mL min–1, which was subsequently found to
be optimal. Increasing the flow rates of both solutions shuts down
the formation of spheres (Figure S3). Increasing
the flow rate of DMF containing graphite up to 2.5 mL min–1 and the flow rate of the fullerene o-xylene solution
to 2 mL min–1 produced dissimilar structures, with
irregular spheroidal structures (Figure S2).

XRD patterns of the spheres are consistent with the material
composed
of graphite/graphene and fullerene C6032 (Figure 5a–c). The spheres were collected immediately after VFD processing
by centrifugation for 30 min, washed twice with hexane, and dried
at 55 °C for 3 days. The major peaks of fcc fullerene C60 are at 2θ = 10.8, 17.7, and 20.8°, corresponding to the
(111), (220), and (311), respectively, with the major peaks at 30.2,
10.8, and 60.8° corresponding to the (002) and (004) planes of
graphite. Clearly, the XRD data establishes the formation of a hybrid
composite material composed of fcc C60 and graphene. From
the Scherrer equation, the crystal domains of fullerenes C60 were estimated to be 6.5 nm in diameter. The presence of graphene
as one or a limited number of stacked sheets is consistent with shifts
in the graphite diffraction pattern,47 as
well as consideration of the energetics of bending a finite number
of sheets, as discussed above. Moreover, the absence of some graphite
peaks can be attributed to assembled fullerene C60 on the
surface of graphene.47 Raman spectra (532
nm excitation) for the spheres prepared at the optimized conditions
and as-received graphite and fullerene C60 before processing,
for comparison, were recorded (Figure 5d–f). Graphite itself has three main peaks,
namely, the D band, G band, and 2D band, at 1349, 1579, and 2717 cm–1, respectively,48,49 and pristine C60 has the pentagonal pinch mode [Ag(2)] at 1469 cm–1 and additional Hg modes at 1420 and 1570 cm–1.50,51 In contrast, the spheres have two Raman peaks at 1364 and 1600 cm–1, which can be attributed to the D band and G band,
respectively, of graphene, in agreement with the literature.50,52,53

Electrochemical Performance
The electrochemical performance
of the composite material as a symmetrical supercapacitor is summarized
in Figure 6. A C60@graphene electrode shows cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a
nearly rectangular shape (Figure 6a), indicating an ideal capacitive behavior similar
to commercial electrochemical capacitors. Figure 6a,b illustrates the CV curves at different
scan rates (5 to 1000 mV s–1), revealing the stability
and ability of the electrode to maintain the ideal rectangular CV
shapes during operation over a wide range of scan rates. The response
anodic and cathodic currents (recorded from the CV curves at 0.5 V)
showed a linear relationship at different scan rates (Figure 6c) with R2 values of 0.9975 and 0.9979 for the charge and discharge
curves, respectively.

curves of graphene sphere composites at different current densities,
(e) gravimetric capacitance and areal capacitance values versus scanning
rate calculated from the CV curves of the graphene sphere composites,
and (f) Nyquist plot of graphene sphere composites.

The galvanostatic charge/discharge (CD) curves at different
current
densities (Figure 6d) show nearly triangular shapes of the CD curves due to the efficient
EDLC nature of the graphene sphere electrode and fast kinetics of
the electrolyte ion transport through the porous carbon electrode
structure. Additionally, the low equivalent series resistance (ESR)
of the fabricated device can be predicted from a small voltage drop
(IR) of 0.0075 V at the start of the discharge curve measured at a
current density of 1 A g–1. Figure 6e displays the calculated gravimetric and
areal capacitances for the graphene sphere electrode at different
scan rates, delivering a gravimetric capacitance of 29.5 F g–1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1, compared to different
types of graphene spheres.54 This value
is lower due to the absence of residual oxygen-containing functional
groups than reduced graphene oxide.55,56 However, the
graphene sphere electrode has an areal capacitance of 103.4 mF cm–2, which is much higher than reported values for other
carbon derivatives.46,57 Moreover, this device can maintain
its capacitances to 24.7 F g–1 and 86.4 mF cm–2 (83.5%) at a high scan rate of 100 mV s–1, confirming the high rate capability of the graphene sphere electrode.

A Nyquist plot of the graphene sphere electrode (Figure 6f) shows a vertical curve at
lower frequencies and no observed semicircle higher-frequency region,
indicating a nearly ideal capacitive behavior of the cell. The device
shows also a lower ESR of 0.5 Ω owing to the low internal resistance
of the designed electrode material. The impedance phase angle versus
frequency plot for the graphene sphere electrode is illustrated in Figure 7a. The device provides
a phase angle of −83.8° (close to −90°) at
low frequencies, showing an ideal capacitive behavior. Furthermore,
the time constant τ0 at a phase angle of −45°
is found to be 0.16 s; this fast frequency response of the graphene
spheres is directly related to a significant ion transport rate of
the large accessible surface area of the material. The cyclic stability
of the composite electrode was examined by cyclic voltammetry at a
scan rate of 100 mV s–1 for 5000 cycles (Figure 7b), showing a capacity
retention of 97.5%. The nearly identical CV curves for first and last
cycles (Figure 7b,
inset) confirm the good stability and high reversibility of the C60@graphene electrode.

Conclusions
A simple and effective method to fabricate all
carbon spheres built
of fullerene C60 and graphene, under continuous-flow mode
of operation of the VFD microfluidic platform, has been developed.
The structure and the morphology of the spheres were evaluated by
SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The spheres are rather
uniform in size and shape. Importantly, the yield of graphene spheres
is high, and the processing is scalable. The method has potential
for the synthesis of spheroidal composite materials of fullerenes
with other 2D materials. In addition, the use of the composite material
of assembled spheres in an electrochemical device and in supercapacitance,
with high capacitance maintained at a high scan rate, has potential
in developing all carbon energy storage materials.
