The enhancement factor (EF) of surface-enhanced
Raman scattering
(SERS) mainly depends on the electrical field intensity of surface
plasmons in the place of Raman-active molecules. Because of this dependence,
the Raman detection sensitivity is much higher with molecules in a
small metallic gap than near a single metallic surface because of
the intense local electric field resulting from the interaction between
metallic objects. In this study, we investigate the SERS detection
capacity improved by metallic nanoparticles in a micro-SERS sensor
made of a metallic slot and a dielectric strip using the three-dimensional
finite-difference time domain method. We calculated the field and
charge distributions in the metallic sphere–slot junction to
discuss the electromagnetic interaction between the in-sphere localized
surface plasmon and the in-slot surface plasmon polariton. After that,
the EF dependence of the sensor on the in-slot particle’s position,
size, shape, and number is demonstrated and discussed to show the
strategy of optimizing the SERS detection capacity. It follows the
rule that a strong enhancement always appears in a small metallic
gap due to the strong field confinement. We show that the averaging
SERS enhancement factor around the particle can be increased by 105 times, compared to the averaging EF in the slot without metallic
nanoparticles that is reported in our previous work, reaching 106 (all factors in this study are obtained by the fourth power
of the division of the local plasmonic field ELoc to the maximum electric value of the incident light EInc(max)) and at some single points, we have
a factor as high as 1010, which is enough to detect a single
molecule. With metallic nanoparticles, the micro-SERS sensor can be
developed into a highly sensitive tool for the portable and stable
Raman detection of molecules or markers in pharmacology, biology,
etc.

Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) is widely used as a nondestructive
and sensitive spectroscopy technique for detecting molecules’
chemical structure with numerous applications like pharmacology, environmental
protection, security, etc.1−5 Compared to the classic Raman scattering, the modified Raman scattering
is mainly (excluding the chemical enhancement) enhanced by the intense
electric field of surface plasmon polaritons (SPP), which are a collective
oscillation of electrons at the interface between materials of opposite
permittivities.6 The polaritons are often
categorized into two classes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and
localized surface plasmons (LSP). SPP are propagating plasmons at
the plane interface between metals and dielectrics. LSP are nonpropagating
plasmons on metallic nanoparticles, the sizes of which are smaller
than the incident wavelength. They are both widely employed in sensing
applications, such as Casein detection in milk7 and biotinylated bovine serum albumin analysis.8 LSP are commonly exploited in highly sensitive Raman detections.
In particular, colloidal solutions of aggregated metallic nanoparticles
always have very strong enhancement effects due to the intense and
strongly confined electric field in the nanogaps between particles
(noted as hotspot effect). With metallic nanogaps
as hotspots, the enhancement factor (EF, which describes the magnification
times of SERS signal intensity compared to the non-SERS case) can
be higher than 109, even enough to detect a single molecule.9 Meanwhile, in recent years, the advent of integration
technologies has facilitated the miniaturization tendency of instrumentation
in the optical measurements. Many efforts have been made aiming at
miniaturization of Raman detection tools into microdevices by replacing
discrete optic elements with integrated photonic circuits.10−13 Considering the need for chemical and biological detections, on-a-chip
SERS detection systems with a high enhancement factor are one of the
most desirable tools in the near future.

In our previous work,
we demonstrated that a micro-SERS sensor
based on a hybrid waveguide made of a gold slot and a silicon nitride
(Si3N4) strip can conduct SERS detections.14 The SERS enhancement mainly comes from the plasmonic
field of the in-slot SPP excited by the evanescent field of the photonic
mode of the Si3N4 strip.15 As we have reported earlier in our sensor, a portion 20–60%
of the incident power can be transformed into the slot’s plasmonic
mode from the in-strip photonic mode. More details about the sensor
can be found in ref (14). The sensor, with the integration with a microlaser and a microspectrometer,
can be developed into a fully integrated on-a-chip Raman detection
system. However, this sensor only possesses a mild enhancement, such
as 102–103 around the slot corners, not
enough for low-concentration or single-molecule detections. A method
is proposed in this study to improve further the SERS detection capacity
of the sensor.

Interestingly, it has been already shown that
the LSP in metallic
nanoparticles can be excited by the SPP propagating on a metallic
surface or in a metallic wire.16−20 If the gap in the particle surface/wire junction is small enough,
then the local plasmonic field inside will be so intense that Raman
scatterings can be enhanced dramatically. For example, a Ag nanoparticle
wire junction with a 1 nm wide gap can be SERS hotspots with a high
sensitivity down to a few molecules detection.20 Its enhancement factor can be as high as the levels achieved
in colloidal solutions of aggregated metallic nanoparticles. Besides
that, the coupling between SPP and LSP also provides an approach to
excite LSP in nanoparticles with a confined field incidence from a
remote source. Therefore, the SPP–LSP coupling is a possible
strategy to our sensor for further enhancing Raman scatterings signals.

Being encouraged by the initial results14 and by the SPP–LSP coupling, we numerically investigated
in this study the improvement of the SERS detection capability by
placing metallic nanoparticles into the metallic slot of the sensor,
using the three-dimensional finite-difference time domain (3D-FDTD)
method. With SPP as the excitation source, the plasmon modes (localized
SPP–LSP modes) of a gold sphere–slot junction are discussed
systematically with the absorption spectra and the local field/charge
distributions. Compared to the excitation of the sphere in free space,
the electron oscillations of the in-slot sphere, which is excited
by the SPP in a finite metallic slot, have an obvious difference.
To show the strategy of optimizing the sensor’s detection capacity,
the dependence of the enhancement factors around the in-slot particle
on the particle’s position, size, shape, and number is investigated.
Generally, a particle–slot junction with suitably sized gaps
can provide an averaging EF around 106 if all sites in
the junction are covered by Raman-active analytes.

The geometry
of the SERS sensor is shown in Figure 1. The hybrid waveguide of the sensor has
a cross section shown in Figure 1a, where a gold slot with H = 50 nm
and W = 48 nm is laid on the SiO2 substrate,
in which a square Si3N4 strip with side S = 200 nm is embedded below vertically at a depth Dis =
10 nm. Gold and silicon nitride (Si3N4) are
specially chosen as the materials to design the SERS sensor. Gold
is one of the most promising metals for plasmonics in the red and
near-infrared range, together with a high chemical stability. Silicon
nitride (Si3N4) is almost transparent in the
visible and near-IR spectra with a high dielectric constant ε
= 4, which ensures a good confinement of light fields. Water is taken
as the superstrate material, which is the environment of the excitation
and radiation of induced Raman dipoles in molecules if analytes are
dissolved in water. The frame of the sensor is presented in Figure 1b. We set D = 0.5 μm and the length of the slot L = 0.61 μm, which is one period of energy exchange between
the slot and the strip in the hybrid waveguide at λ = 720 nm.
According to the field properties of surface plasmons (being perpendicular
to metallic surfaces), only the TE mode (Ex > Ey, Ez) of the strip can interact with the
plasmonic mode in the metallic slot. The fundamental TE mode of the
isolated strip is obtained by the mode eigensolver of the software
and it is used as the incident light. To conduct a SERS signal detection,
the incident light is injected into the Si3N4 strip. Then, it couples into the gold slot and excites the in-slot
propagating SPP, which can induce Raman dipoles in Raman-active molecules
in the slot. The radiation of induced Raman dipoles in the slot can
excite plasmonic modes guided in the slot and then the plasmonic modes
couple back into the Si3N4 strip and finally
to the spectrometer. The |E| field distribution
on an x-normal plane with x = 24
nm (across a slot wall) is presented in Figure 1c when the fundamental TE mode of the Si3N4 strip is injected at z = 0.25
μm as the incidence. It is worth noting that all of the electric
field in this study is normalized with the maximum value of the incident
electric field. Figure 2 shows the charge distributions on the slot walls. It is seen that
the SPP is excited in the slot and particularly the electric field
around the slot corners is obviously stronger than that in the strip.
The in-slot field distributed along the z-axis has
some fluctuations, which come from the in-slot SPP interferences caused
by the reflection of the slot’s facets. To some degree, the
finitely long metallic slot can be taken as a cavity and it traps
the SPP modes insides. The strip–slot coupling is the route
to exchange energy between the cavity (slot) and the exterior (strip).

a y-normal plane with y = 22 nm.
The wavelength is 720 nm.

If a metallic nanoparticle is added into the slot, then there
will
be a strong SPP–LSP interaction and intense electric field
between the nanoparticle and the slot walls. We focus on this interaction
and the enhancement in the particle–slot junction in this study.
The sensor structure in Figure 1 is always kept as the same in the following discussion with
metallic nanoparticles.

Results and Discussion
To confine
the electric field into a small area or gap in the sensor’s
slot, one method is making the in-slot metallic particle size close
to the slot width. Then, the gaps between the particle and the slot
walls can be limited in a few nanometers, which can act as the hotspots
for SERS. Here, assuming that a gold sphere with a 44 nm diameter
is placed at the bottom center of the 48 nm wide slot with center
coordinates x = 0 nm, y = 22 nm,
and z = 0.805 μm, as shown in Figure 3a, two 2 nm wide gaps are created
in the sphere–slot junction. With the fundamental TE mode of
the Si3N4 strip as the incident light, the in-slot
SPP is excited and it excites the electron oscillation of the gold
sphere in its propagation. As shown in Figure 3b,c, the intense local electric field appears
in the 2 nm wide gaps of the sphere–slot junction. Compared
to the |E| field distribution in Figure 3d, which is the case
without the gold sphere, the field intensity with the sphere, particularly
in the sphere–slot wall gaps, is raised dramatically. If analyte
molecules are in these gaps, their Raman scatterings can be strongly
enhanced. Therefore, these hotspots around the in-slot particle can
be regarded as the probe volume of the sensor. In this study, we define
the probe volume by a cuboid: [−W/2 < x < W/2; 0 < y < H; Zcsphere – Rsphere < z < Zcsphere + Rsphere], where Zcsphere is the z coordinate of the sphere center and Rsphere is the sphere radius. If not specified otherwise, the probe volume
is kept the same in the following discussion.

720 nm. (d) |E| field distribution on
the plane y = 22 nm at λ = 720 nm before the
in-slot sphere is added.

SPP–LSP Coupling
To demonstrate clearly the
SPP–LSP coupling in the gold sphere–slot junction, the
attention is first placed in the case of a sphere and an infinite
slot, which avoids the interferences of the in-slot SPP in the sensor
described in Figure 1. As shown in the top inset of Figure 4, the slot is infinite in the +z direction
and a gold sphere with diameter 44 nm is assumed to be located in
the slot. The absorption curves of the gold sphere in the infinite
slot are reported in Figure 4. The absorption of the same gold sphere without the gold
slot (as shown in the bottom inset) is also included for comparison.
It is seen that the peak 546 nm does not appear in the absorption
curves of the in-slot spheres. That means this peak (resulting from
the direct interaction of the sphere and the Si3N4 strip) is suppressed in the hybridization of the in-slot SPP and
the in-sphere LSP. When the z-axis position of the
in-slot sphere changes from z = 0.805 to 1.0 μm,
the highest absorption peak decreases and shifts from 690 to 732 nm.
This is reasonable because the in-slot SPP fields distribute in the
beating pattern along the z-axis direction and the
strongest electromagnetic fields of different wavelengths appear at
different z-axis positions.

Figure 4 Absorptions of a 44 nm
diameter gold sphere in the infinite slot
with center coordinates: x = 0 nm, y = 22 nm, and z = 805/1000 nm (top inset) and the
same sphere with coordinates: x = 0 nm, y = 22 nm, and z = 805 nm when the slot is removed
(bottom inset).

When the slot of the
sensor is finite, as shown in the inset of Figure 5, the absorption
curve of the in-slot sphere is reported below. For comparison, the
green absorption curve of the sphere in the infinite slot in Figure 4 is also included.
Compared to the case of the infinite slot, the sphere in the sensor’s
finite slot has a new peak at 846 nm. The SPP fields of the finite
slot are modulated constructively or destructively by the interferences,
as shown in Figure 3c,d, which are the excitation source of the in-sphere LSP. Subsequently,
the in-sphere plasmons are shaped by the interferences, leading to
the appearance of the new peak at 846 nm. Besides that, the absorption
peak at 960 nm is constant no matter whether the slot is infinite
or finite. The charge distributions of the sphere–slot (infinite
and finite) junctions for the peaks at 690 nm are shown in Figure 6. It is obvious that
the electron oscillations in the sphere–slot junction are much
stronger than those on the slot walls. If the local slot walls in
the junction are taken as a metallic pseudonanoparticle, the charge
distributions are the typical light mode in the hybridization of two
particles. For convenience, the oscillation modes of the electrons
in the sphere–slot junction are noted as localized SPP–LSP
modes, which result from the hybridization of the SPP in the finite
slot and the LSP in the sphere.

sphere located at x = 0 nm, y =
22 nm, and z = 805 nm when it is in an infinite/finite
slot. The inset shows
the case of the finite slot and the geometry is the same as that in Figure 1a,b.

and finite)

and (d) for the finite slot. (a, c) z-Normal plane

To discuss the SERS enhancement in the sphere–slot
wall
gaps, one example point is chosen at coordinates (23, 22 nm, 0.805
μm). This point is the center of the right sphere–slot
wall gap marked by a red star in Figure 3a. It has been mentioned before that all
of the electric field in this study is normalized with the maximum
value of the incident electric field. So, the |E|4 approximation can be simplified as EF = |ELoc/Eref|4 = |ELoc|4 when the reference electric field Eref is chosen as the maximum value
of the incident electric field. According to the local electric field ELoc, the enhancement factor of
the example point is reported in Figure 7. The |E|4 approximation, which is used extensively to estimate EFs
in the literature of SERS, has been proven to be valid in this calculation
by our previous works.14 The EF curves
of the same point in the cases with the isolated sphere and the isolated
slot are also included for comparison. We note that only the wavelength
range from 600 to 900 nm is concerned for the EF discussion because
the coupling between the strip and the slot is very weak when the
wavelength is smaller than 600 nm. When the sphere–slot junction
is present, the EF of the example point is raised to a level of 106 at 693 nm, 4 orders of magnitude higher than the isolated
slot or sphere. A shoulder (639 nm) and two peaks (693, 847 nm) appear
in the red solid EF curve. The charge distributions of the sphere–slot
junction corresponding to the three wavelengths are presented in Figure 8. If grouping these
modes by the sphere charge, we can see that the shoulder at 639 nm
comes from one quadrupole mode and the two other peaks come from two
dipole modes. The three wavelengths agree with the shoulder and the
peaks of the black absorption curve in Figure 5. When only the finite slot exists above
the embedded strip, two peaks at 654 and 781 nm appear in the EF curve
of the sample point in Figure 7. This is because the local electric field of the example
point is constructively or destructively interfered along the z-axis direction due to the facet reflection in the finite
slot.

Figure 7 Enhancement factors based on the |E|4 approximation of the example point, which is marked
by a red star at 23, 22 nm, and 0.805 μm in Figure 3a, involving three cases: the
gold sphere, the gold slot, and the gold sphere–slot junction.

0.805 μm in (a)–(c) and on the y-normal
cross section through the sphere–slot junction with y = 22 nm in (d)–(f) corresponding to the localized
SPP–LSP modes of the red EF curve in Figure 7.

Multifactor Dependence of the EFs in the Probe Volume
We
have discussed the SPP–LSP coupling between the slot and
the sphere on the basis of the assumption that a gold sphere is located
at the bottom center of the slot of the sensor. However, it would
be very difficult to accurately put a particle at a desired position
in a nanoscale slot in actual experiments. The sphere’s position
is directly related to the sphere–slot wall gap size (transverse
position) and the intensity of the local SPP (longitudinal position).
So, the enhancement for Raman scatterings around the sphere is inevitably
affected by the sphere’s position.

To show the influence
of the sphere’s transverse (x axis) position
on the enhancement in the probe volume, a transverse offset of +1
or +2 nm is added to the sphere in Figure 3a. With the offsets, the sphere–slot
wall gaps are modified with width = 1, 3 and 4, 0 nm (wedge gap),
respectively. The averaging enhancement factors of the probe volume
around the sphere are reported in Figure 9. The case with no transverse offset of the
sphere is also included for comparison. We know that a transverse
offset of the sphere position would narrow one of the sphere–slot
wall gaps and a narrower gap can confine the electric field further
with the more intense intensity. So, the offset increases the enhancement
around the sphere. Comparing the red and green curves in Figure 9, it is seen that
the EF peaks show a red shift with a transverse offset. When the offset
is +2 nm, the sphere touches the slot wall and the sphere–slot
wall gap becomes a wedge gap. It has the sharpest nanostructure, leading
to the highest enhancement factor around the sphere. On the other
hand, there is no SPP–LSP hybridization when the particle touches
the slot wall. Therefore, its curve shapes of the averaging and maximum
EFs are different from the other two cases in Figure 9. The inset graph presents the maximum enhancement
factors of the probe volume around the sphere. The max EFs are 104 times higher than the corresponding averaging values. The
EF curves of the maximum and averaging values in the probe volume
have the similar curve shapes.

Figure 9 Averaging enhancement factors of the cuboid
probe volume when the
sphere position has a transverse offset 0, 1, or 2 nm, respectively,
with center coordinates x = 0, 1, or 2 nm; y = 22 nm; and z = 0.805 μm. The
inset graph shows the maximum enhancement factors in the probe volume.
In the inset image, the white cuboid shows the probe volume around
the sphere.

When the sphere has the
longitudinal (z-axis)
position z = 0.6, 0.7, and 0.805 μm with x = 0 nm and y = 22 nm, the enhancement
factors of the probe volume are reported in Figure 10. We note that the optical reciprocity of
Raman excitation and radiation is broken because the sphere deviates
from the longitudinal middle of the metallic slot (details can be
found in the Supporting Information). Then,
the |E|4 approximation is
modified as EF = |Ex,y,z|2 ×
|Ex,y,1.61 μm–z|2.
Because of the symmetry, the EFs in the two half ranges of the slot
from z = 0.5 to 0.805 μm and z = 0.805 to 1.11 μm are symmetrical. We only analyze the first
range here. The longitudinal position does not change the sphere–slot
wall gap size, so the enhancement factors in the probe volume stay
at similar levels in Figure 10, 104 for the averaging value and 106 for the maximum value. On the other hand, the EF curve shape has
an obvious change when the sphere’s longitudinal position changes.
The reason is that the in-slot local SPP fields change along the longitudinal
direction. It has been mentioned before that the in-slot SPP fields
distribute in the beating pattern along the z-axis
direction and that the strongest/weakest electromagnetic fields of
different wavelengths appear at different z-axis
positions. Moreover, along the longitudinal direction, the SPP electric
field is affected by the constructive or destructive interferences
caused by the slot facet reflection. The sphere is excited directly
by the in-slot SPP and subsequently the in-sphere plasmons are also
shaped by the longitudinal change of the SPP intensity. So, the sphere’s
longitudinal position would change the SPP–LSP modes in the
sphere–slot junction. The electric field distributions of all
of the peaks in Figure 10 are shown in Figure S2 of the
Supporting Information.

Figure 10 Averaging enhancement factors of the cuboid
probe volume when the
sphere has the longitudinal position z = 0.6, 0.7,
and 0.805 μm with the other center coordinates x = 0 nm and y = 22 nm. The inset graph shows the
maximum enhancement factors in the probe volume. In the inset image,
the white cuboid shows the probe volume around the sphere.

When the sphere diameter changes, the enhancement
around the sphere
would be modified due to the size change of the sphere–slot
wall gaps. This is a little similar to the change of the sphere’s
transverse position that has been discussed. The averaging and maximum
enhancement factors of the probe volume around the sphere with different
diameters are presented in Figure 11. The bigger diameter results in a red shift of the
three localized SPP–LSP modes of the sphere–slot junction.
Because of the size decrease of the sphere–slot wall gaps and
more intense local electric field, the enhancement factors in the
sphere–slot junction increases when the sphere becomes bigger.
However, putting a bigger sphere into the slot would become more difficult.
It also impedes the analyte molecules from entering into the gaps
if the sphere–slot wall gaps are too small.

Figure 11 Averaging enhancement
factors of the cuboid probe volume when the
sphere diameter is D = 42, 44, and 46 nm with center
coordinates x = 0 nm; y = 21, 22,
and 26 nm; and z = 0.805 μm. The inset graph
is the maximum enhancement factors in the probe volume. In the inset
image, the white cuboid shows the probe volume around the sphere.

Except for the sphere, the in-slot
particle can have other shapes,
such as cube and cylinder. The enhancement factors of the probe volume
around the particles with different shapes are presented in Figure 12. The sphere case
is also included for comparison. The sizes of all of the particles
are the same, i.e., 44 nm, and they are located at the bottom center
of the slot, like the sphere in Figure 3a. All of the gaps of the particle–slot junctions
are 2 nm wide, so the averaging enhancement factors around these particles
are on the similar order of magnitude. Compared to the others, the
cube has one more peak on the red EF curve. This is because the cube
has more LSP modes in free space and so as the SPP–LSP modes
in the cube–slot junction. The electric field distributions
of the peaks and shoulders in Figure 12 are presented in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 12 Averaging enhancement factors of the
cuboid probe volume when the
particle has different shapes with the same center coordinates x = 0 nm, y = 22 nm, and z = 0.805 μm. The cube side is 44 nm. The height and diameter
of the cylinder are both 44 nm. When the axis of the cylinder is along
the z/y-direction, it is marked
with “H”/“V”. The sphere diameter is 44
nm. The inset graph shows the maximum enhancement factors in the same
volume. In the inset image, the white cuboid shows the probe volume
around the particles (the sphere, for instance).

We have discussed the cases in which the particle size (42–46
nm) is just a little smaller than the slot width, 48 nm. There may
be a problem in actual experiments when putting the particle into
the nanoscale slot. An intuitive way to solve this problem is decreasing
the particle size. If some surface functional technologies are used,
the particles can be immobilized near the slot walls to create some
small particle–slot wall gaps. Then, the strong enhancement
for Raman scatterings can still be obtained in the particle–slot
junction. The enhancement factors of the probe volume around some
very small particles that are close to the slot walls are shown in Figure 13. All of the particle–slot
wall gaps are 2 nm wide. Here, we note that the probe volume is redefined.
It is seen that all of the EF curves have two peaks around 650 and
770 nm. At these peaks, the in-sphere electrons oscillate in a dipole
mode, which is known from the electric field distributions around
the particles presented in Figure S4 of
the Supporting Information. The two wavelengths 650 and 770 nm are
similar to the peak positions 654 and 781 nm of the blue dash curve
in Figure 7, which
for the EF of the sample point without the in-slot particle. That
means that the influence of the in-slot particles with diameter 10
nm on the in-slot field distribution is almost negligible after the
particles are added into the slot. The localized SPP–LSP modes
in the particle–slot junction are mainly determined by the
interfered SPP of the slot, whereas the in-sphere LSP does not obviously
influence the resonant wavelengths of the junction. So, the EF curves
of the probe volume around the small particles have peak positions
similar to the EF peaks of the sample point before the particles are
added. In Figure 13, the cube has the largest enhancement factor, whereas the sphere
has the smallest one.

Figure 13 Averaging enhancement factors of the cuboid probe volume
when the
in-slot particle has different shapes with the same center coordinates x = 17 nm, y = 5 nm, and z = 0.805 μm. The cube side is 10 nm. The height and diameter
of the cylinder are both 10 nm. When the axis of the cylinder is along
the z/y-direction, it is marked
with “H”/“V”. The sphere diameter is 10
nm. The inset graph shows the maximum enhancement factors in the same
volume. In the inset image, the white cuboid shows the probe volume
around the particle (the cylinder “V”, for instance).
Here, the probe volume is redefined as: [10 nm < x < 24 nm; 0 < y < 12 nm; 800 nm < z < 810 nm].

To obtain more hotspots or probe volumes in the sensor, an
intuitive
method is to put more nanoparticles into the slot. The averaging enhancement
factors of the probe volume when two gold spheres are added into the
sensor’s slot are reported in Figure 14. When the sphere diameter is 44 nm, the
two particles are located with center coordinates x = 0 nm, y = 22 nm, and z = 0.805/1.0
μm. When the diameter of the two spheres is 10 nm, they are
placed at z = 17 nm, y = 22 nm,
and z = 0.805/1.0 μm. The 44 nm diameter spheres
have two 2 nm gaps with the slot walls, whereas the 10 nm diameter
spheres have one 2 nm sphere–slot wall gap. Here, the probe
volume around the 10 nm diameter spheres is redefined as that in Figure 13. When the two
in-slot spheres have the diameter D = 44 nm, it is
seen that the highest peak (1.60 × 104 at λ
= 696.5 nm) of the red EF curve for the probe volume around the first
sphere is lower than the maximum EF value (3.05 × 104 at λ = 693.5 nm) of the red EF curve in Figure 9. It means that the enhancement effect in
the probe volume of the first gold sphere decreases due to adding
the second sphere into the slot. The green EF curve of the second
sphere with diameter 44 nm is much lower than the first sphere because
the first sphere impedes the in-slot SPP to reach the second sphere.
It is seen in Figure 15a that the field |E| in the slot with z > 0.805 μm is obviously weaker than the range z < 0.805 μm. When the diameter of the two in-slot
spheres is 10 nm, the impediment of the first sphere for the SPP propagation
is smaller, as shown in Figure 15b. It is seen that the highest peak (3.42 × 103 at λ = 780.5 nm) of the blue EF curve around the first
sphere is similar with the maximum EF value (3.33 × 103 at λ = 777.5 nm) of the black EF curve in Figure 13. It means that there is almost
no EF reduction for the first sphere after the second one is added
into the slot if its diameter is 10 nm. So, if the particle size is
big, it is not suggested to put many metallic particles into the sensor’s
slot. If the particles are small, more than two particles could be
employed in the slot to obtain more hotspots and output more Raman
signals.

Figure 14 Averaging enhancement factors of the cuboid probe volume when two
gold spheres are added into the sensor’s slot. When the two
in-slot spheres have the diameter 44 nm, the first sphere is located
with center coordinates x = 0 nm, y = 22 nm, and z = 0.805 μm (like that in Figure 3a) and the second
one is placed with x = 0 nm, y =
22 nm, and z = 1.0 μm. When the two in-slot
spheres have the diameter 10 nm. The first gold sphere is located
with center coordinates x = 17 nm, y = 5 nm, and z = 0.805 μm (like that in Figure 13) and the second
one is placed with x = 17 nm, y =
5 nm, and z = 1.0 μm. The edge-to-edge distances
between the spheres are 185 nm (the diameter is 10 nm) and 151 nm
(the diameter is 44 nm). The inset graph shows the maximum enhancement
factors in the probe volume. Here, the probe volume of the 10 nm diameter
sphere is redefined as: [10 nm < x < 24 nm;
0 < y < 12 nm; 800 nm < z < 810 nm].

Figure 15 |E| field distributions at λ
= 789 nm (a) on an x-normal plane across the center
of the in-slot particles with the diameter D = 44
nm and (b) on an x-normal plane across the center
of the in-slot particles with the diameter D = 10
nm.

When the diameter of two in-slot
metallic particles is 10 nm, there
is a possibility that the two particles arrange along the x-axis direction. The enhancement factors around two gold
spheres arranging in the x-axis direction are presented
in Figure 16. The
black EF curve in Figure 13 is also included for comparison. The sphere–sphere
gap is assumed to be 2 nm. In the inset |E| image, it is seen that the second sphere is excited by the LSP
on the first sphere and intense electric field appears in the sphere–sphere
gap. Compared to the case of one particle, the enhancement factors
of the same cuboid probe volume can be bigger. For example, the averaging
enhancement factor increases 3 times from 3124 to 9516 at 777.5 nm.
When the two particles have another shape (cube and cylinder), the
enhancement factors of the same probe volume are shown in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information.

Characterization of the SERS Detection Capability
To
characterize the SERS detection capability of the sensor quantitatively,
the sensor with a 44 nm diameter gold sphere at the bottom center
of the slot, which is described in Figure 3a, is chosen as an example here. The EF average
of the probe volume is 3.052 × 104 when the excitation
wavelength is 693.5 nm, as shown by the red EF curve in Figure 9. The excitation power is assumed
to be 10 mW, and the excitation wavelength is 693.5 nm. The lowest
detectable power of the detector refers to the Ocean Optics QE65 Pro
spectrometer. The Raman-active dyes, rhodamine 6G (RH6G) and benzotriazole
dye 2 (BTZ), are chosen as the probe molecules, which are dissolved
in distilled water. For simplicity, the depolarization ratio of the
Raman tensor ρR is assumed to be 0 and the molecules
distribute in the probe volume uniformly. Under the two assumptions,
the Raman signal intensity (electron number per second) given out
by the SERS sensor is reported in Figure 17. The typical Raman spectra of RH6G and
BTZ are shown in the inset, which is reproduced from ref (6). It is seen that the RH6G
solution with concentration of 1.36 × 10–5 mol/L
and the BTZ solution with concentration of 1.13 × 10–4 mol/L are detectable by the sensor at room temperature. If the detector
is cooled, BTZ can be detected with concentration of 6.06 × 10–6 mol/L. If the in-slot gold sphere has a 2 nm transverse
offset, the EF average of the probe volume will increase to 9.10 ×
105 at λ = 693.5 nm, as shown by the blue EF curve
in Figure 6. Then,
the lowest detectable concentration in Figure 17 can be decreased 30 times.

second excited by the Raman signals of RH6G
and BTZ on the detector of an Ocean Optics QE65 Pro spectrometer.
The SERS sensor has a gold sphere with diameter 44 nm at the bottom
center of the slot, as shown in Figure 3a. The two black lines are the dark current of the
spectrometer. The inset shows the typical Raman spectra of RH6G and
BTZ.6

Conclusions
In this study, we have investigated theoretically
the effect of
in-slot metallic nanoparticles on improving the detection capacity
of the SERS sensor. We have first investigated the SPP–LSP
coupling between the metallic slot and the metallic nanoparticle.
It is found that the localized SPP–LSP modes appear in the
metallic sphere–slot junction because of the electromagnetic
hybridization of the in-slot metallic particle and the finite slot
(a half-open cavity). The influences of the particle position, size,
shape, and number on the enhancement in the probe volume around the
in-slot particle have been investigated adequately to point out the
strategy to optimize the sensing performance. The gold particles in
the sensor’s slot can make several molecule detections possible
in the sensor by providing averaging EFs as high as 106 in the probe volume. To characterize quantitatively the sensor’s
SERS detection capacity, a specific sensor with a 44 nm diameter gold
sphere at the bottom center of the slot is chosen as an example here.
It is seen that the RH6G solution with 1.36 × 10–5 mol/L and the BTZ solution with 1.13 × 10–4 mol/L are detectable at room temperature by the sensor. In realistic
detections, the metallic nanoparticles can be synthesized chemically,
such as the citrate-reduced gold colloids, which are centrifuged to
get the particles. Then, the diluted particle solution can be dripped
and dried on the sensor’s slot directly or functionalized by
surface techniques such as ligand-exchange with aqueous thiol molecules.
These results demonstrate that a SERS detection system with high enhancement
factors can be realized on a compatible chip based on our SERS sensor
with metallic nanoparticles.

Methods
All of the simulations in
this study are implemented by the three-dimensional
finite-difference time domain (3D-FDTD) algorithm with the commercial
software package FDTD solutions provided by Lumerical Solutions, Inc.
The simulation region was set as a cuboid volume of 1 μm ×
1 μm × 1.5 μm, with perfectly matched layers as the
six boundaries. All of the objects, sources, and monitors were laid
in this simulation volume. The dielectric function data of silicon
nitride (Si3N4) were referred to the experimental
data obtained in ref (21). All of the other optical constants were taken directly from the
database of the FDTD software.
