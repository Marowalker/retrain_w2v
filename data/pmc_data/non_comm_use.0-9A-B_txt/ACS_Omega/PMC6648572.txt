The N3–-substituted
Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba)
phosphors were systematically
prepared and analyzed. Secondary-ion mass spectroscopy measurements
revealed that the average N3– contents are 0.003
for Ca, 0.009 for Sr, and 0.032 for Ba. Furthermore, the N3– incorporation in the host lattices was corroborated by infrared
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. From the photoluminescence
spectra of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca,
Sr, and Ba) phosphors before and after N3– doping,
it was verified that the enhanced emission intensity of the phosphors
is most likely due to the N3– doping. In Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors,
the maximum wavelengths of the emission band were red-shifted in the
order Ca < Ba < Sr, which is not consistent with the trend of
crystal field splitting: Ba < Sr < Ca. This discrepancy was
clearly explained by electron–electron repulsions among polyhedra,
LiO4–MOn, SiO4–MOn, and MOn–M’On associated
with structural difference in the host lattices. Therefore, the energy
levels associated with the 4f65d energy levels of Eu2+ are definitely established in the following order: Li2CaSiO4:Eu2+ > Li2BaSiO4:Eu2+ > Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+. Furthermore, using the Williamson–Hall (W–H)
method, the determined structural strains of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors revealed that
the increased compressive strain after N3– doping
induces the enhanced emission intensity of these phosphors. White
light-emitting diodes made by three N3–-doped phosphors
and a 365 nm emitting InGaN chip showed the (0.333, 0.373) color coordinate
and high color-rendering index (Ra = 83).
These phosphor materials may provide a platform for development of
new efficient phosphors in solid-state lighting field.

Introduction
Recently, many researchers
have focused their attention on rare-earth-doped
phosphor materials for solid-state lighting, especially in white light-emitting
diodes (w-LEDs). Commercialized w-LEDs are made up of a blue-emitting
LED chip and a yellow-emitting phosphor (Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce)). However, they exhibit a
low color-rendering index (CRI) because they generate weak red emission.1 To solve the problem, optimal phosphors should
be newly developed. Therefore, new classes of phosphors based on metal
silicates, metal sulfides, metal oxy-nitrides, and metal nitrides
have been developed.2−9 Liu et al. reported that Li2CaSiO4:Eu2+ (with a tetragonal phase, space group I4̅2m) has high absorption from the UV to the
near-UV region and a strong emission at ∼480 nm with a narrow
bandwidth.9 Orange-yellow-emitting Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+ (with a trigonal crystal
system and belonging to space group P3121) was prepared and compared to the commercialized YAG:Ce phosphor
by Varadaraju et al.10 Recently, the crystal
structure and PL properties of Eu2+-doped Li2BaSiO4 have been elucidated and discussed by Kulshreshtha
et al.11 and Kim et al.,12, i. e., the hexagonal crystal system (belonging to space
group P63cm) and green
emission at ∼508 nm, respectively. Based on the structures
of the host materials in Li2MSiO4 (M = Ca, Sr,
and Ba), it is presumed that the luminescent properties of these phosphor
materials may be closely related to the chemical environment around
the Eu2+-activator ion. It is well known that alkaline-earth
silicon–oxynitride phosphors with the RE-ion activator (RE
= Ce3+, Eu2+, Yb3+, etc.) have been
intensively studied in recent years because they are potential candidate
materials for improving the low luminous efficiency and low CRI for
w-LEDs.13−16 The N3– ions substituted partially for O2– ions in the host lattice could change the electronic structure of
Eu2+ owing to their difference in electronegativity, ionic
radius, and magnitude of crystal field splitting, as well as the nephelauxetic
(cloud expanding) effect of the two ions,3,17 which
results in the change of the PL properties of the phosphors before
and after N3– doping. Song et al. mentioned that
the partial nitridation of Li2SrSiO4–3x/2Nx:Eu2+ (x = 0.01) phosphors induced a highly enhanced PL intensity
by as high as 190%.18 Therefore, it is
presumed that their results for the N3– doping effect
on an increase of the luminescent intensity are meaningful even though
the N3– contents doped into the crystal sites were
not determined. However, systematic research for the N3– doping effect of Li2MSiO4 (M = Ca and Ba)
has not been pursued to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the
present study is also motivated by the desire to devise a white near-UV
LED because Eu2+-activated Li2MSiO4 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors exhibit blue, orange-yellow, and
green emission, respectively. Herein, we report on the highly enhanced
luminescence of N3–-substituted Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) and a white near-UV
LED using three phosphors.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Crystal
Structure
The crystal structure
of each compound was characterized by its X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern using the Rietveld method19 with
the FullProf program.20 From the ICSD database,
the equivalent isotropic displacement parameters and atomic coordinates
were used. Using a pseudo-Voigt function with an asymmetry correction
at low angles, the shape of the peak was fitted. The obtained patterns
from Rietveld refinement of the XRD data are presented in Figure 1. The final values
of the equivalent isotropic displacement parameters and atomic coordinates
are given in Table S1 (and Tables S3 and S5). The selected bond distances
are presented in Table S2 (and Tables S4 and S6). Figure 2 shows the change in lattice volume before
and after the nitridation of each Li2MSiO4 compound.

Determination of N3– Contents by Secondary-Ion
Mass Spectroscopy
To determine the N3– contents
of Li2CaSiO4−δN2/3δ (LCSON), Li2SrSiO4−δN2/3δ (LSSON), and Li2BaSiO4−δN2/3δ (LBSON), secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
analysis was used. It is well known that SIMS gives the best detection
limit for identifying elements with very low concentrations compared
to other techniques in surface analysis area. The elemental composition
using SIMS can be quantitatively determined with an ion-implanted
standard material.3,21,22Figure 3 shows the
atomic intensity and concentration versus the sputter depth of the
compounds. For Li, Si, and O atoms among the three phosphors, no difference
in the secondary-ion intensities was observed, while the intensities
of secondary-ion for Ca, Sr, and Ba atoms changed because of the different
sensitivities of the elements. The concentrations of N atom are analyzed
as a function of sputter depth from the surface to the inner region
of the grains (∼5000 nm) for the three samples. The contents
of N3– ion were calculated as shown in Figure 3d. The average contents
of N3– ion for LCSON, LSSON, and LBSON were 0.003,
0.009, and 0.032, respectively. It is remarkable that the N3–-ion content increases with larger alkaline-earth metal-ion size
(Ba2+ > Sr2+ > Ca2+), probably
implying
that Li2MSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors with the larger ion
size can easily accommodate more N3– ions in the
crystal sites. The framework of the Li2MSiO4 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) structure is connected by SiO4 and
LiO4 tetrahedra with M2+ ions, where two SiO4 and LiO4 tetrahedra are linked through sharing
of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the bond lengths of MOn polyhedra may be affected by the N3– content
introduced into the host lattice. The average bond distances for the
three compounds (see Tables S2, S4, and S6) were determined as 2.535 Å for LCSON, 2.625 Å for LSSON,
and 2.877 Å for LBSON.

Evidence of N3– Incorporated in the Host Lattice
from Infrared and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Measurements
The infrared (IR) spectra of Li2MSiO4 (M
= Ca, Sr, and Ba) compounds before and after N3– doping are shown in Figure 4. As the chemical bond of Si–O is stronger than that
of M–O (M = Li, Ca, Sr, and Ba), the internal vibrations of
SiO4 tetrahedra are nearly independent of the lattice vibrations
and exclusively observed in the 400–1000 cm–1 range. As shown in Figure 4, the [SiO4] internal modes are assigned to the
Si–O stretching modes23−25 between 770 and 950 cm–1 and to the O–Si–O bending modes26,27 between 400 and 560 cm–1. Furthermore, based on
the far-IR modes of MCO3 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) (Figure S1), the force constant (K) of M–O,28 the reduced mass (μ)
of M–O (μ = 11.43 for Ca–O, μ = 13.53 for
Sr–O, μ = 14.33 for Ba–O), and the M–O
stretching modes are estimated to be 314 cm–1 for
Ca–O stretching, 257 cm–1 for Sr–O
stretching, and 239 cm–1 for Ba–O stretching.
Remarkably, the Si–O stretching modes between 770 and 950 cm–1 are somewhat decreased after N3– doping, which implies that the N3– ions are partially
substituted into the Li2MSiO4 (M = Ca, Sr, and
Ba) host lattice. The Gaussian-fitted IR modes of LSSO and LSSON between
1100 and 770 cm–1 (Figure 5) corroborate the presence of N3– ions substituted into the host lattice, i.e., after N3– doping, the sub-band centered at 825 cm–1 shifts
to the band with a maximum at 817 cm–1. This chemical
shift can be easily explained by a comparison of the chemical bond
distance (1.62 Å for SiO2 and 1.73 Å for α-Si3N4)29,30 and the chemical bond energy
(454 kJ/mol for SiO2 and 426 kJ/mol for α-Si3N4)31 between SiO2 and α-Si3N4. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) results warrant the evidence of N3– doping, closely related to the red shift of the Si–O stretching
modes (from IR measurement) in these compounds. Figure 6 shows Si 2p (ref SiO2, ref α-Si3N4, LSSO, and LSSON) and N 1s (LSSO and LSSON)
XPS binding energies. All XPS patterns were fitted after a Shirley
background correction. As presented in Figure 6, the Si 2p binding energy (ref SiO2) is 102.8 eV with a single Gaussian band (Full width at half-maximum
= 1.9 eV), whereas the Si 2p binding energies (ref α-Si3N4) is composed of two bands (101.4 and 102.8 eV).
In the Si 2p binding energy (ref α-Si3N4), the sub-band at 102.8 eV may be due to superficial oxidation.
The Gaussian-fitted LSSO and LSSON XPS images (middle) reveal that
the Si 2p binding energy of LSSON (100.7 eV) is lower than that of
LSSO (101.5 eV), which means that the N3– ions are
partially substituted into the LSSO crystal lattice. Furthermore,
the N 1s binding energy (393.4 eV) of LSSON corroborates the N3– introduction in the LSSO host lattice.

Photoluminescence Monitored under UV Light
Figure 7 presents photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M
= Ca, Sr, and Ba) before and after N3– doping. The
excitation spectra of the three phosphors are somewhat different in
shape, probably because of the distinct crystal system of host lattices:
tetragonal for Li2CaSiO4, trigonal for Li2SrSiO4, and hexagonal for Li2BaSiO4. For Ca and Sr, the emission intensities are increased after
N3– doping, by factors of 1.8 and 1.5, respectively.
For Ba, there is no considerable increase even after N3– doping. The emission spectra exhibit broad bands with band maxima
between 450 and 650 nm: 480 nm for Ca, 569 nm for Sr, and 509 nm for
Ba. The 4f–5d transition energy of Eu2+ is greatly
dependent on the local environment because the local structure around
Eu2+-activator ion has a great influence on the centroid
shift energy (CS) and crystal field splitting (CFS) of the 5d levels
as well as the Stokes shift (ΔS) of the emission.
Among the factors determining the 4f–5d transition energy of
Eu2+, the center of gravity (barycenter) of the 5d levels
is lowered relative to the free Eu2+ in the vacuum state,
mainly ascribed to the covalent bonding character between Eu2+ and coordinating anions (O2–). Separately from
a centroid shift, the neighboring anions have an additional influence
on the 4f65d1 energy level of Eu2+, known as crystal field splitting (CFS). The magnitude of the CFS
is dependent on the geometrical interaction between 5d orbitals and
anion ligands: the energy of the 5d electron is raised because of
the larger repulsion between the 5d electron in an orbital oriented
toward an anion ligand and the electrons in the neighboring ligands,
whereas that of the 5d electron in an orbital oriented away from an
anion ligand is lowered. It should be mentioned that Pauling’s
rule 3 based on the hard-spheres electrostatic model32 states that the sharing of edge and face by two polyhedrons
decreases the stability of an ionic structure because of the increase
in cation–cation repulsions as the cations get close together.
For a certain coordination geometry, the degree of cation–cation
repulsions also increases in the following order: corner-shared <
edge-shared < face-shared. Thus, Pauling’s rule 3 means
that most ionic solids will prefer to be corner-shared rather than
edge- or face-shared because of the bond stability. Notably, Morrison
verified that the shift of the central energy of 4fn–15d configurations (for activator ion) is directly
proportional to the summation of ligand polarizabilities over all
nearest coordinating anion ligands.33 Shi
et al. reported that the barycenter energy of 4fn–15d configuration on Eu2+ ions is strongly
dependent on the environmental factor (he) 1  where N is the number of
ligands, fc is the average fractional
covalence, Q is the charge of the nearest anion,
and α is the average bond volume polarizability.34

Sr, and
Ba) compound before and after N3– doping; M = Ca
(a), M = Sr (b), M = Ba (c), relative emission intensity (d).

Therefore, the clear explanation
for the wavelength shift of the
emission band maxima in Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) requires reconsideration of the structural
aspects of the compounds because the energy levels of Eu2+ are perturbed by neighbor cations and anions, such as O2–, Si4+, Li+, and M2+ (M = Ca, Sr,
and Ba). Figure 8 shows
the bonding types between a MOn polyhedron
and SiO4 (or LiO4) tetrahedra in Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba). For example,
if one assumes that the Eu2+ activator occupies the Ca1
site in a CaO8 polyhedron, the repulsion between Eu2+ and Si4+ (or Li+) is more prominent
than that from the neighbor CaO8 polyhedra (×8) with
corner-sharing through O atoms because of the difference in the bond
distance between Ca–O and Si–O (or Li–O). As
shown in Figure 8,
a MOn polyhedron is connected by SiO4 tetrahedra, LiO4 tetrahedra, and M’On polyhedra with shared corners, edges, and
faces depending on the crystal structure in Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba). According to Pauling’s
rule 3, in the only corner-shared polyhedra, the cations (or anions)
are away from each other, while the distances between the cations
(or anions) are getting shorter from edge-shared to face-shared, which
finally results in the more enhanced electron–electron repulsions.
Consequently, the energy levels of the Eu2+ activator stabilized
in a MOn polyhedron are perturbed and
changed depending on the electron–electron repulsions between
neighbor anions and Eu2+. Table 1 presents the bonding type between an AO4 tetrahedron (A = Li and Si) and a MOn polyhedron (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba). From the qualitative estimation
of Table 1, the energy
order of the 5d energy levels (Eu2+) can be determined
as follows 2  The fact that the emission
spectra of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca,
Sr, and Ba) (see Figure 7) show variation
of the band maxima (at 480 nm for Ca, 569 nm for Sr, and 509 nm for
Ba) warrants that our interpretation of the emission band maxima from
Ca to Ba in these compounds is reasonable. Figure 9 presents the diffuse reflectance spectra
(DRS) of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr,
and Ba) before and after N3– doping. It is evident
that the absorption intensities between 250 and 500 nm of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are greatly
increased compared to those of the host lattices of Li2MSiO4. Furthermore, for M = Ca and Sr, the absorption
bands of the N3–-doped compounds are greatly intensified
compared to those of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+, probably as a result of the N3– doping, which
is in agreement with the PL results (see Figure 7). From the DRS, the band gap energies (Eg) were determined using the Kubelka–Munk
transformation, and these are presented in Figure 10. It should be noted that Eg of the Li2CaSiO4:Eu2+ compound was previously reported as 5.21 eV, using the Kohn–Sham
density functional theory method.35 In
this study, we determined the following Eg values of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca,
Sr, and Ba): 5.44 eV for Ca, 5.16 eV for Sr, and 5.34 eV for Ba. From
band structure calculations,36,37 the valence band of
Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba)
is mainly formed by the O 2p states and the conduction band is predominantly
made up of M 5d and Si 3p states. For Li2MSiO4 host lattices, the band gap energies progressively decrease along
with Ca → Ba → Sr because the order of energy levels
of M 5d orbitals is Li2CaSiO4 > Li2BaSiO4 > Li2SrSiO4, as mentioned
in the energy order of the 5d energy levels (2).

N3– Doping Effect on the PL Intensity: Williamson–Hall
Plot
To precisely examine the N3– doping
effect, the structural strain induced by the N3–-doping was estimated because the ionic radius of N3– (1.46 Å at CN = 4) is larger than that of O2– ion (1.38 Å at CN = 4). The strain can be determined using
the Williamson–Hall (W–H) method from XRD profile analysis.38 The total peak width at half-maximum intensity
(βhkl) is determined from the summation
of the size broadening (βD) and the strain broadening
(βs) 3  The size broadening is correlated with the
Scherrer equation: βD = kλ/(D cos θ), where D is
the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, and k is the shape factor. The strain broadening is expressed
by ε = βs/4 tan θ, where
ε is maximum strain (tensile or compressive). Thus, we get the
W–H equation from eq 3 4  The plot of βhkl cos θ/λ versus 4 sin θ/λ
can give crystallite size from the y-intercept and
strain due to lattice deformation from the slope. The W–H plots
present the stain (ε) of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) before and after N3– doping (Figure 11): for Li2CaSiO4:Eu2+, from −0.012%
(before N3– doping, LCSO) to −0.026% (after
N3– doping, LCSON); for Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+, from 0.0056% (before N3– doping, LSSO) to −0.0095% (after N3– doping,
LSSON); and for Li2BaSiO4:Eu2+, from
−0.035% (before N3– doping, LBSO) to −0.032%
(after N3– doping, LBSON). The positive and negative
values correspond to the tensile and compressive strains, respectively.
As the temperature increases, generally, a crystal lattice undergoes
tensile stress and expands. It is generally accepted that under the
tensile stress, the lattice vibrations and/or the formation of defects
force the phosphors more easily to promote nonradiative relaxation.39−41 Thus, it is presumed that the enhancement of PL intensity is ascribed
to the compensation of the thermally induced tensile stress by the
compressive stress due to the N3– doping in Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors.
The fact that the PL intensities of the two phosphors (for Ca and
Sr) remarkably enhanced after N3– doping, whereas
that of Li2BaSiO4:Eu2+ is not changed,
corroborates the structural strain effect on the PL intensity (see Figure 7). Furthermore, the
structural strain effect by the N3– doping prominently
appears in UV–visible absorbance spectra (see Figure 9). Evidently, for Ca and Sr,
the stronger absorption bands between 300 and 500 nm are present after
N3– doping, while for Ba, the absorption bands are
nearly same before and after N3– doping. Presumedly,
the compressive strain plays an important role in the effective transfer
of the absorbed energy from the host lattice to the activator ion
even though the difference of strain values before and after N3– doping is very small, resulting in the enhanced absorption
band and PL intensity.

and LBSO:Eu before
and after N3– doping.

Photoluminescence of LEDs
To examine the potential
of the as-synthesized phosphors for near-UV LED application, phosphor-converted
LEDs were made using a phosphor powder and a InGaN LED with 365 nm
emission. Figure 12 shows the emission spectra of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors before and after N3– doping using an InGaN LED (λmax = 365 nm) under
forward-bias currents from 10 to 50 mA. Figure 12 clearly shows that the 365 nm UV light
emitted from the InGaN chip is absorbed by the phosphors and simultaneously
downconverted into intensive, wide-band-emitting light. Upon increasing
the forward-bias current from 10 to 50 mA, the emission intensities
of the phosphors progressively increase. At the same time, the luminous
output increases and the shape and position of the LED emission bands
exhibit similarity, thus confirming that the phosphors show a stable
emission property. As presented in Figure 12, the maximum LED emission intensity for
Ca and Sr increases after N3– doping, which is consistent
with the PL spectra (see Figure 7). For a white LED, the N3–-doped
Li2MSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors were mixed and monitored
using a color coordinate meter to determine the appropriate mixing
proportions. The appropriate mixing proportions were determined as
46.7 wt % Ca, 46.6 wt % Sr, and 6.7 wt % Ba. Figure 13 presents the CIE chromaticity of LEDs monitored
under a forward-bias current of 50 mA. The N3–-doped
Li2CaSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ emits blue light with the (0.090, 0.253) chromaticity
coordinate. The N3–-doped Li2SrSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ emits
yellow light with the (0.496, 0.495) chromaticity coordinate. The
N3–-doped Li2BaSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ emits green light with the
(0.241, 0.584) chromaticity coordinate. Finally, the white zone formed
by mixing the light from the three phosphors corresponds to the (0.333,
0.373) chromaticity coordinate, a color-rendering index of Ra = 83, and correlated color temperature of
5480 K.

Conclusions
In
this work, Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M
= Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors before and after N3– doping were systematically prepared and analyzed. SIMS measurement
revealed that the average contents of N3– ion for
LCSON, LSSON, and LBSON were 0.003, 0.009, and 0.032, respectively,
probably implying that Li2MSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors
with larger ion size can easily accommodate more N3– ions in the crystal lattice sites. Furthermore, the N3– sited in the host lattices was corroborated by IR and XPS analyses,
i.e., the chemical shift of Si–O stretching mode from 825 to
817 cm–1 after N3– doping (for
LSSON) and the chemical shift of Si 2p binding energy from 101.5 to
100.7 eV and the presence of the N 1s binding energy at 393.4 eV after
N3– doping (for LSSON). From the PL spectra in Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors
before and after N3– doping, it was verified that
the enhanced emission intensity of the phosphors is most likely due
to N3– doping. The change of the emission band maxima
was also investigated in these phosphors. In Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors, the maximum
wavelengths of the emission bands were red-shifted in the order Ca
< Ba < Sr, which is not consistent with the trend of crystal
field splitting: Ba < Sr < Ca. This discrepancy between the
shift of emission band maxima and trend based on the crystal field
splitting was clearly explained by electron–electron repulsions
among polyhedra, LiO4–MOn, SiO4–MOn, and MOn–M’On associated with structural difference in host lattices. Therefore,
the energy levels associated with the 4f65d → 4f7 transition of Eu2+ are definitely established
in the following order: Li2CaSiO4:Eu2+ > Li2BaSiO4:Eu2+ > Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+. Furthermore, using Williamson–Hall
(W–H) method, the determined structural strains of Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors revealed
that the increased compressive strain after N3– doping
plays an important role in the enhanced PL intensity of these phosphors.
White LEDs fabricated by a combination of three N3–-doped phosphors and a 365 nm emitting InGaN chip exhibited the (0.333,
0.373) color coordinate and a high color-rendering index (Ra = 83). These phosphor materials may provide
a platform for development of new efficient phosphors in solid-state
lighting field.

Experimental Section
Li2MSiO4:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and
Ba) phosphors were prepared from a stoichiometric mixture of MCO3 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba), SiO2, Li2CO3, and Eu2O3 under a reducing atmosphere
(4% H2/Ar) at 900 °C for 12 h. N3–-doped Li2MSiO4−δN2/3δ:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) phosphors were prepared from
a stoichiometric mixture of MCO3 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba),
α-Si3N4, Li2CO3,
and Eu2O3 under NH3 atmosphere at
900 °C for 12 h. The Eu2+ ion concentration was fixed
at 1 mol %. X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out using a graphite
monochromator (DMAX-2200PC, Rigaku). A step scan mode was selected
in a 2θ range (10–110°) with a step size of 0.02°
and counting time of 5 s for each step. The refinements of crystal
structure were carried out by the Rietveld method using the FullProf
program. The diffraction profiles were fitted using a pseudo-Voigt
peak function and manually selected background points. FT-IR analyses
were carried out using a Bruker VERTEX70 FT-IR spectrometer with an
extension in the far-IR region. The extension consists of a multilayer
mylar beam splitter, a room-temperature DLATGS detector with preamplifier,
and polyethylene windows for the internal optical path. The binding
energies of the elements were determined by an X-ray photoelectron
spectrophotometer (ESCALAB 250) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray
source (hν = 1486.6 eV) at Busan Center of
Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). The determined binding energies
were calibrated using the internal standard of adventitious carbon
(C 1s at 284.6 eV). SIMS (CAMECA IMS-6f, France) was carried out to
determine the elemental composition of the N3–-substituted
phosphors. The SIMS standard was used with 14N isotope
implanted into SiO2 film as N+ at 100 keV (a
dose of 5 × 1014 ions/cm2). To determine
the relative sensitivity factor (RSF) of each element, the intensity
of secondary ion was corrected by the SIMS results from the standard
material. For a careful examination, the Cs+ primary-ion
beam was focused using an electron neutralizer for charge compensation
(net impact energy = 15 keV; beam current = 20 nA). The PL spectra
were obtained using a fluorometer (FS-2 model, Scinco) with a xenon
lamp (150 W) under an operating voltage of 350 V. The diffuse reflectance
spectra were obtained using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(UV-2600, Shimadzu) with a BaSO4 reference.
