Molecular mechanics
force field parameters for macromolecules,
such as proteins, are traditionally fit to reproduce experimental
properties of small molecules, and thus, they neglect system-specific
polarization. In this paper, we introduce a complete protein force
field that is designed to be compatible with the quantum mechanical
bespoke (QUBE) force field by deriving nonbonded parameters directly
from the electron density of the specific protein under study. The
main backbone and sidechain protein torsional parameters are rederived
in this work by fitting to quantum mechanical dihedral scans for compatibility
with QUBE nonbonded parameters. Software is provided for the preparation
of QUBE input files. The accuracy of the new force field, and the
derived torsional parameters, is tested by comparing the conformational
preferences of a range of peptides and proteins with experimental
measurements. Accurate backbone and sidechain conformations are obtained
in molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides, with NMR J coupling errors comparable to the widely used OPLS force
field. In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure
is generally retained, and the NMR J coupling errors
are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss
of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the
proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of
system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach
for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.

1 Introduction
Molecular mechanics (MM) force fields for biomolecular simulations
have been under continuous development for many years.1−5 In traditional transferable force fields, every atom in a molecule
is assigned a type based on its atomic number, bonding, and local
chemical environment. The atom type then dictates the parameters that
are used to model that atom’s interactions.3 The force field parameters for each atom type are stored
as a library, which is built by carefully reproducing the experimental
or quantum mechanical properties of a benchmark set of small molecules.2−7 Due to the infeasibility of accurately parameterizing all of chemical
space, a balance must be made between the size of the library and
potential inaccuracy due to transferring parameters to molecules outside
the fitting set. In many cases, it is acknowledged that transferable
force fields are not sufficiently accurate.8 When building force fields for small molecules, the atomic charges
are usually assigned in a system-specific or “bespoke”
manner, using methods such as RESP, CM1, or AM1-BCC.9−13 This is because it is well-known that atomic charges polarize in
response to their chemical environment (for example, the presence
of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups).8 Bespoke charges are usually assumed to be compatible with
the fixed Lennard-Jones parameters of the force field, although these
have also been shown to be dependent on the local environment of the
atom.14 Although proteins must also experience
polarization effects in both the charges and Lennard-Jones parameters,
protein force field parameters have always, to date, been assigned
from a transferable library.1−3,15 This
leads to an inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for
protein force fields and bespoke small-molecule force fields. This
is potentially problematic when studying properties that depend on
the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions
with small molecules, and there is no clear way around this using
traditional force field fitting methods.

To improve the consistency
between charge and Lennard-Jones parameters
and also reduce the reliance on fitting to experimental data, one
could either directly fit nonbonded MM parameters to reproduce quantum
mechanical (QM) energies and forces16−19 or derive the nonbonded parameters
of the force field directly from QM. In the latter approach, the QM
interaction energy may be broken down into physically motivated components
using intermolecular perturbation theory,20−22 although these
methods are limited to quite small system sizes. Encouragingly, Grimme’s
quantum mechanically derived force field (QMDFF) method is capable
of outputting bespoke nonbonded force field parameters for molecules
comprising more than 100 atoms.23 Despite
using fixed point charges, with no explicit polarization term, the
bespoke force field reproduces both QM inter- and intramolecular energies
to an accuracy of around 1 kcal/mol for small-molecule benchmarks.

In recent years, we have been following a similar strategy to Grimme’s
QMDFF, focusing more on condensed phase properties and heterogeneous
systems.24,25 The basis of this approach is the density
derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) atoms-in-molecule (AIM)
scheme,26,27 which partitions the total electron density
into approximately spherical atom-centered basins. Atomic charges
are derived by integrating the atomic electron density over all space,
and in contrast to direct fitting of the QM electrostatic potential
(ESP charges), it is possible to derive chemically meaningful DDEC
atomic electron densities and charges for both surface and buried
atoms.28 A further advantage of this approach
is that the Lennard-Jones parameters may also be computed directly
from the atomic electron densities, using methods based on the Tkatchenko–Scheffler
relations that are commonly used to incorporate dispersion effects
into density functional theory (DFT) calculations.14,24 Similar to the Grimme approach, these nonbonded parameters are derived
from a single QM optimized structure, which would be problematic if
the charges show strong conformation dependence. However, Manz and
Sholl have demonstrated that DDEC charges are transferable between
different conformations of a molecule (as measured by their ability
to recreate the QM electrostatic potential), and they concluded that
the charges are suitable for the construction of flexible force fields.27 Furthermore, it should be noted that AIM electron
density partitioning lends itself naturally to the derivation of both
off-site charges to model electron anisotropy (such as lone pairs
and σ-holes)25 and atomic polarizabilities,29 although we have not yet investigated a fully
polarizable force field.

In keeping with our goal of deriving
force field parameters directly
from QM, rather than fitting to experiment, we have supplemented the
AIM nonbonded parameters with harmonic bond and angle parameters derived
directly from the QM Hessian matrix.30 There
are a number of methods available for deriving bonded parameters from
the QM Hessian matrix,23,31 but our recent adaptation of
the Seminario method32 (which we named
the modified Seminario method) is conceptually quite straightforward
while yielding parameters that reproduce QM vibrational frequencies
with a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 49 cm–1, below
that of OPLS (59 cm–1). Collectively, we have named
this method as the quantum mechanical bespoke (QUBE) force field.
This name reflects the fact that force field parameters are derived
by the user specifically for the small molecule under study, directly
from QM calculations. We have released a software toolkit (QUBEKit)
that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field
parameters and also allows the user to derive the positions of off-site
charges to model anisotropic electron density and to fit dihedral
parameters to QM torsion scans.25 QUBE
force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules and
yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm3, 0.79 kcal/mol,
and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization,
and free energy of hydration, respectively.25 These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields,
which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.

To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided
drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field.
Since the nonbonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very
different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g.,
AMBER, OPLS, and CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they
are compatible. However, by implementing the AIM nonbonded parameter
derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional
theory (DFT) software,33 we have shown
that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters
for entire proteins.24 In this way, the
number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have
a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both
small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies.
Since, in this approach, all nonbonded parameters are derived from
a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters
naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment.
Importantly, we have shown that protein charges derived using DDEC
electron density partitioning recreate the underlying QM electrostatic
potential with high accuracy, and that charges derived for an NMR
ensemble of BPTI protein structures are not too conformation-dependent
(standard deviations per residue less than 0.04 e).34 This is in contrast to the performance of RESP charges,
which have been shown to be significantly more conformation-dependent
for an ensemble of polypeptide structures.35 Additional simulations demonstrated the feasibility and advantages
of deriving bespoke parameters for a protein–ligand complex.
The computed relative binding free energy of indole and benzofuran
to the lysozyme protein using the environment-specific force fields
(−0.4 kcal/mol) was in excellent agreement with experiment
(−0.6 kcal/mol) and was substantially more accurate than standard
force fields (−2.4 kcal/mol). However, the force field was
in need of further development as the bespoke nonbonded terms were
used in combination with standard OPLS-AA bonded parameters. The use
of these parameters potentially limits the accuracy of the force field
due to interdependency between the bonded terms, particularly the
torsional parameters, and the nonbonded components of the force field.
This issue is the subject of the current paper.

In standard
transferable force fields, the torsional component
is typically parameterized using QM dihedral energy scans, with the
difference between analogous MM and QM energy scans minimized by fitting
the torsional parameters.1 Reparameterization
of the torsional terms has been shown to be a crucial step in improving
the accuracy of force fields, and this has recently been demonstrated
for AMBER ff15ipq, CHARMM36, and OPLS-AA/M.1,2,15 Bond and angle reparameterization has also
been shown to be an essential stage in improving the accuracy of biomolecular
force fields,2,36 although it is not so frequently
carried out. Since it is not currently feasible to derive accurate
QM Hessian matrices for entire proteins, we have used the modified
Seminario method to compute a complete set of bond and angle parameters
for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids.30 This work focuses on the remaining component of the force field,
namely, the refitting of key torsional parameters that describe the
backbone and sidechain dynamics of an amino acid. The methods and
validation tests broadly follow the approaches employed in the development
of OPLS-AA/M, the latest OPLS force field.1 Torsional parameters are fit by minimizing the differences between
multiple QM and MM potential energy scans of dipeptide backbone and
sidechain dihedral angles. Our overall goal is to test the extent
to which bespoke nonbonded parameters may be combined with libraries
of bonded parameters to produce a protein force field that is compatible
with our QUBE small-molecule force field for use in computer-aided
drug design applications.

The performance of the QUBE protein
force field is tested through
comparisons between experiment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
for a set of 20 dipeptides, the glycine tripeptide and alanine pentapeptide,
and a range of small folded proteins. This benchmark test set is similar
to those used in the development of protein force fields such as AMBER
ff15ipq, AMOEBA, CHARMM36, and OPLS-AA/M.1,2,5,15 As we shall
show, the QUBE protein force field is competitive with standard transferable
force fields for the dipeptide set and alanine pentapeptide while
retaining the experimental structures of small folded proteins reasonably
well. To encourage further testing of the QUBE protein force field,
MD input files for the molecules studied and the necessary scripts
to convert the QM electron density to QUBE force field format have
been made available (https://github.com/cole-group/QUBEMAKER). Finally, in Discussion and Conclusions, we outline a roadmap
for future improvements to QUBE.

2 Theory
The functional form of the standard biomolecular force field has
five components. Covalent interactions between atoms are modeled using
harmonic bond stretching and angle bending parameters, while rotations
about a bond are described by anharmonic four-body torsional terms.
Nonbonded interactions are described by a sum of Coulombic interactions
between (usually) atom-centered point charges and a physically motivated
Lennard-Jones interaction, which combines a short-range repulsive r–12 potential with a longer-range attractive r–6 interaction. We now provide an overview
of how these various components are parameterized in the QUBE protein
force field and contrast the approaches to those used in standard
transferable force fields. Since the methods used to parameterize
the nonbonded and bond and angle terms have been extensively described
elsewhere,24,25,28,30 we focus here on the derivation of the torsional
parameters.

2.1 Nonbonded Parameters
The nonbonded
components of a molecular mechanics force field aim to describe the
quantum mechanical electrostatic, dispersion, and exchange–repulsion
interactions in a computationally efficient manner.37 The charge parameters are generally fit to the quantum
mechanical electrostatic potential of small molecules. The Lennard-Jones
parameters are then fit to reproduce experimental data, such as liquid
densities and heats of vaporization.2,6,38

The aim of QUBE is to move away from the requirement
for transferable force field parameters and instead to derive bespoke
parameters for molecules directly from QM calculations. First, a QM
simulation of the molecule under study is performed. From the output
of the QM calculation, the total electron density of the molecule
is partitioned onto individual atoms using an AIM weighting scheme.
There is no unique method to perform this partitioning, but we favor
the DDEC scheme,26,27 which is a weighted combination
of the iterative stockholder atoms and iterative Hirshfeld approaches.39,40 With the electron density partitioned to individual atoms, the atom-centered
charges can be simply found by integrating the electron density over
all space (and adding the nuclear charge). We have implemented the
DDEC approach in the ONETEP software package, which allows us to perform
QM calculations of, and assign parameters to, systems comprising thousands
of atoms. The derived charges have been shown to be suitable for use
in flexible force field design in multiple works because they are
able to reproduce the underlying QM electrostatic dependence while
exhibiting low conformation dependence.24,27,34 The charges are specific to the system under study,
and by performing the QM calculation in the presence of an implicit
solvent model, polarization of the charges in the condensed phase
can be included in the model.24

The
dispersion and exchange–repulsion interactions are described
using a Lennard-Jones potential with a form: 1  

The dispersion coefficient, Bij, is
calculated from the partitioned electron density by using the Tkatchenko–Scheffler
relationship to rescale the free atom dispersion coefficient by the
computed volume of the atom in the molecule.14,24 The standard combination rule, , can then be
used to determine heteroatomic
dispersion coefficients. The Aij parameter,
which describes the short-range repulsion between overlapping electron
clouds, cannot be readily calculated directly from the electron density.
Instead, it is computed by requiring that the minimum in the interatomic
Lennard-Jones potential coincides with the estimated van der Waals
radius of the atom in the molecule.24 This
nonbonded parameter derivation scheme requires just one fitting parameter
per element (corresponding to the van der Waals radius of the free
atom in vacuum).

2.2 Bond and Angle Parameters
The parameterization
approach used to determine bond and angle harmonic force constants
in traditional force fields, such as OPLS and AMBER, is to fit them
to reproduce QM data or experimental normal mode frequencies. This
creates interdependencies in the force field parameters. That is,
bond and angle parameters depend on the nonbonded and torsional parameters
used during the fitting process, and therefore, they cannot be easily
transferred to the QUBE force field. Instead, we derive bond and angle
force constants directly from the QM Hessian matrix of the molecule
under study, while equilibrium bond lengths and angles are taken from
the optimized geometry of the molecule.30 This method is a modification of the Seminario method32 and is based on the computation of the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of the partial Hessian matrix, kAB: 2  

The harmonic bond force
constants are given by 3  where ûAB is a vector in the direction of the bond AB,
and νiAB (λiAB) is an eigenvector
(eigenvalue) of the kAB matrix.

Similar methods may be used to derive the angle force constants,
and we introduce a correction to the standard Seminario method, which
takes into account the geometry of the molecule under study.30 Consistent improvements in the computed normal
modes were demonstrated using this modified Seminario method for a
range of molecules. In particular, QM vibrational frequencies for
a set of dipeptides were reproduced with an accuracy of 40 cm–1, which compares favorably with the OPLS force field
(47 cm–1) and the original Seminario method (104
cm–1). Since the derived bond and angle parameters
do not depend on the choice of nonbonded and torsional parameters,
the derived parameters are suitable for use in the QUBE protein force
field. Since large-scale polarization effects are expected to be significantly
less important for bond and angle parameters than for charges, we
use the library of bonded parameters provided previously30 (and the same atom types as those used for OPLS-AA/M1).

While preparing the protein simulations,
it was found that our
library had missing parameters for the disulfide bridge between pairs
of cysteine residues. These bond and angle parameters were therefore
derived using the QM Hessian matrix of dimethyl disulfide and are
supplied in Section S2.3 of the Supporting
Information.

2.3 Torsional Parameters
With new bond,
angle and nonbonded parameters derived, all that remains to complete
the QUBE protein force field is to obtain the torsional parameters.
Unfortunately, it is infeasible to derive torsional parameters from
QM simulations that are specific to each protein. Therefore, we make
the assumption that the derived parameters for dipeptides are transferable
to proteins, and in Section 4, we test the limitations of this assumption by validating
the force field against experimental peptide and protein dynamical
observables.

The torsional terms in a force field are a function
of the dihedral angles (ϕ) in a molecule. Here, we use the same
functional form as the OPLS force field 4  where the
sum runs over all
dihedrals (k) in the molecule and V1–4kare parameters to be fit. We focus on reparameterizing
the backbone (ϕ, ϕ′, ψ, and ψ′)
and sidechain (χ1, χ1′, χ2, and χ2′) torsional
parameters (Figure 1). Refitting of the remaining torsional and improper parameters are
beyond the scope of the current work, and these parameters are instead
taken from the OPLS-AA/M force field.1 However,
parallel efforts are being made to develop a toolkit for automated
parameterization of small molecules using the QUBE force field, which
will facilitate derivation of the remaining parameters in future.25

Figure 1 Alanine residue showing the atom naming convention for
dihedral
angles. The main dihedral angles reparameterized are ϕ (C–N–Cα–C), ϕ′ (C–N–Cα–Cβ), ψ (N–Cα–C–N), ψ′ (Cβ–Cα–C–N), χ1 (N–Cα–Cβ–Xγ), χ1′ (C–Cα–Cβ–Xγ), and χ2 (Cα–Cβ–Xγ–Yδ). Xγ and Yδ (not
shown) are the neighboring heavy atoms in the sidechains (if present).

When fitting torsional parameters, the main objective
is to minimize
the difference between MM and QM gas phase dihedral energy scans.
However, weighting schemes and regularization can also be used to
change the form of the error function that is minimized. Regularization
is a technique generally used to prevent overfitting to data. There
are multiple forms of regularization that can be applied to improve
fitting.2,25 In this work, we use a harmonic restraint
that is added to the error function.2 This
penalty term ensures that torsional parameters do not deviate significantly
from their initial value unless a significant improvement in the agreement
with the QM energy surface is observed. As we will show, even with
low levels of regularization (a small λ value), a sizeable increase
in performance is observed for the QUBE force field. The general form
of the error function used in this study is given by 5  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is a weighting
temperature, n is the number of points at which the
energy is evaluated, Wj is the contribution
from the weighting scheme, λ is the regularization coefficient
(this term is independent of n and can take any positive
value), Vi is the torsional parameter
being optimized, and Vi0 is an initial estimate
of the torsional parameter. Where we have used a harmonic restraint,
we have used Vi0 = 0 as the initial guess as previously
suggested.41 The V4 term was set to zero throughout the fitting procedure to
avoid overfitting.1EQMjand EMMjare the QM and MM optimized energies at each
sampled dihedral angle relative to the lowest QM or MM energy, respectively.
MM scans allow all other degrees of freedom to optimize, and so, the
structures are similar, but not identical, to the QM structures. Weighting
schemes are used to prioritize accuracy in particular regions of the
dihedral scan, for example, in the β-sheet region of the Ramachandran
plot. A range of weighting schemes has been previously used, including
schemes that prioritize the lowest QM energies1 or that prioritize regions that have been shown experimentally to
be most populated by proteins.5,15

3 Methods
3.1 Torsional Parameter Fitting
Torsional
parameter fitting followed the general strategy employed in the development
of the OPLS-AA/M force field,1 among others,
in which parameters are fit to reproduce QM gas-phase potential energy
surfaces. Fitting and validation were performed using dipeptides of
the form (Ace-X-NMe), where X is the amino acid, Ace is an acetyl
group, and NMe is the N-methyl group.

3.1.1 QUBE Parameter Derivation
The ground-state
electron densities of the dipeptides were computed using the ONETEP
linear-scaling DFT code33 with the PBE
exchange-correlation functional and standard parameter settings (Supporting
Information, Section S2.2).24 Since the reference QM potential energy scans
are performed in the gas phase, we have decided to derive QUBE force
field charges and Lennard-Jones parameters from the vacuum electron
density (rather than in an implicit solvent). The assumption here
is that the required correction to the MM potential energy surface
is approximately the same in the gas and condensed phases.

Charge
and Lennard-Jones parameters were derived from the QM ground-state
electron density using the DDEC scheme26,27 as implemented
in the ONETEP code28,34 (Section 2.1). As discussed previously, DDEC charges
show low, but nonzero, conformational dependence.28 To account for this, the nonbonded parameters were derived
for multiple conformations of each dipeptide and averaged. Input files
for the full set of dipeptide structures are provided in the Supporting Information. Nonbonded parameters
on identical atoms (for example, hydrogen atoms in a methyl group)
were symmetrized. It should be noted that only atom-centered charges
were used in this work, although off-site charges to model anisotropic
electron density distributions, particularly on sulfur atoms,42 may lead to improvements in future work.25 Bonded parameters were assigned to the dipeptides
from the library developed using the modified Seminario method using
OPLS-AA/M atom typing rules.30

3.1.2 Potential Energy Scans
The torsional
potential energy scans of alanine, glycine, and all sidechains are
the same as those used in the development of the OPLS-AA/M force field,
as described previously.1 In brief, structures
were relaxed in the gas phase using Gaussian 09 with a ωB97X-D
functional and a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Dihedral angles were scanned
in 15° increments from −180 to 180°. A single-point
energy calculation was then performed on the optimized structure using
the double-hybrid functional B2PLYP-D3(BJ) and the Dunning basis set
aug-cc-pVTZ. A 2D scan of ϕ (C–N–Cα–C) and ψ (N–Cα–C–N)
was carried out for alanine and glycine.

The sidechain energy
scans follow the same methods as the backbone scans, except that the
single-point B2PLYP calculation was not performed for all χ2 scans, as ωB97X-D was shown to give sufficiently accurate
results.1 These 1D scans give the energy
as a function of the χ1 dihedral angle (N–Cα–Cβ–Xγ) or the χ2 dihedral angle (Cα–Cβ–Xγ–Yδ). The ψ and ϕ angles were constrained to an α-helical
(ϕ = – 60 ° , ψ = – 45°) or a
β-sheet (ϕ = – 135 ° , ψ = 135°)
conformation. All scans used in this work can be found in the Supporting
Information of ref (1).

In this work, an additional 2D scan of the ϕ and ψ
dihedral angles of serine was found to be necessary for accurate torsional
parameters for serine and threonine, which both have a polar oxygen
atom at the Xγ position. This followed similar protocols
to those previously described; however, the sidechain χ1 angle now had to be taken into account. Scans were performed
at 30° increments of ϕ/ψ, for χ1 initially set to −60, 60, and 180°. These gave three
2D energy scans for the main rotamers of serine. The minimum energy
structure for each ϕ/ψ angle was then used to construct
the overall minimum ϕ/ψ potential energy surface (Section
S3.1).

3.1.3 Fitting Dipeptide Torsional Parameters
Torsional parameters were optimized by minimizing the error function
shown in eq 5 using a
steepest descent algorithm. MM potential energy surfaces were computed
by scanning dihedral angles in 15° increments using the BOSS
software.43 The backbone torsional parameters
for all dipeptides tested, excluding serine and threonine, were fit
to the alanine and glycine scans previously described. The total error
for the two scans was given by 6  with the
prefactors corresponding
to the relative frequency of each amino acid in the human proteome.
Preliminary testing (Section S1.1) showed
that a weighting function and regularization did not significantly
improve the conformations sampled during the dipeptide MD simulations
and so were not used (λ = 0, W = 0).

The remaining dipeptides, threonine and serine (both of which contain
aliphatic hydroxyl groups in their sidechain), were assigned identical
backbone parameters that were fit to reproduce the QM scans of serine.
For these scans, regularization and weighting were shown to be necessary
to produce dipeptide dynamics, which were in agreement with experiment.
An investigation of how the simulation error changes with regularization
is given in Section S1.2. The harmonic restraint parameter was set
to λ = 0.05.

The sidechain scans for all dipeptides followed
the same fitting
process as the alanine/glycine backbone with no weighting or regularization
used. As atom typing is not used for the nonbonded parameter assignment
in the QUBE force field, each set of sidechain torsional parameters
is also residue-specific. This differs from the approach used in OPLS-AA/M
in which sidechain torsional parameters with the same set of atom
types are generally assigned the same parameters.

In a number
of cases, it was necessary to make manual changes to
the fitting process. This was restricted to setting a number of torsional
parameters to zero (that is, λ = ∞) and reducing the
number of scans used in the fitting process. In particular, the aspartic
acid ψ/ϕ distribution was improved by setting the χ2 torsional parameters to zero. Additionally, using only the
QM energy scan with the lowest minimum energy in the fitting process
was shown to result in an improvement in the MD simulations of the
dipeptides for the χ1 torsional parameters of cysteine,
methionine, serine, and threonine. The need for manual input in the
fitting process was also required for developing OPLS-AA/M and is
likely due to the restrictive functional form of the torsional potential
and the conformational dependence of the energy scans.1 The full set of manual changes involved is listed, along
with the final torsional parameters, in Section S3.3.

3.1.4 Alanine Pentapeptide
and Glycine Tripeptide
As the nonbonded parameters used are
specific to the system under
study, they are not the same for an alanine dipeptide molecule as
for the alanine pentapeptide (Ala5). The alanine residue
in the dipeptide is blocked by acetyl and N-methyl
groups, whereas the central three alanine residues in Ala5 have neighboring alanine residues on both sides. Therefore, varying
environments exist for alanine residues in the different molecules.
Consequently, the parameters found for the alanine dipeptide were
found to be unsuitable for MD simulations of Ala5 (Table S5). However, the use of a harmonic restraint
in the fitting process resulted in torsional parameters that were
sufficiently accurate for the alanine and glycine peptide simulations.
Alanine and glycine backbone torsional parameters were refit to the
QM energy scans with λ = 0.50, and no weighting was used. The
optimal value used for the regularization parameter was found by minimizing
the differences between simulated and experimental NMR observables
for Ala5 (Table S5). We note
that the J coupling error is not too sensitive to
the strength of the harmonic restraint. Separate torsional parameters
are used for the alanine pentapeptide and glycine tripeptide (Gly3), as residue-specific parameters should result in a more
accurate force field.

3.1.5 Protein Torsional Parameters
It
is expected that optimal backbone torsional parameters for protein
simulations are more similar to those developed for Ala5 and Gly3 than for the set of dipeptides. We therefore
use a regularization λ = 0.50 for all protein backbone torsional
parameter derivation. Alanine, glycine, serine, and proline torsional
parameters are fit to available QM potential energy surfaces and are
therefore residue-specific. Threonine uses torsional parameters fit
to the serine torsional scan, and all other amino acid use torsional
parameters fit to joint alanine/glycine energy scans. These backbone
parameters are combined with the dipeptide sidechain torsional parameters
to give the full QUBE protein force field parameter set.

3.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
3.2.1 Simulation
Details
Following a
number of previous force field studies,1,2,5,15 the QUBE force field
was validated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a benchmark
test set of five proteins. The structures chosen (with the PDB codes
shown in parentheses) were ubiquitin (1UBQ), GB3 (1P7E), BPTI (5PTI), binase (1BUJ), and a villin headpiece subdomain (2F4K).

Figure 2 shows the steps
required to set up a QUBE protein force field for an MD simulation.
In Section 2.1, the
ONETEP linear-scaling DFT software is used to compute the ground-state
electron density of the five proteins and assign the charge and Lennard-Jones
parameters from the partitioned atomic electron densities. Consistent
with the QUBE small-molecule approach, every atom in the protein is
assigned bespoke nonbonded parameters derived from the quantum mechanical
electron density. To model polarization effects in the condensed phase,
the electron density is computed first in vacuum and then using an
implicit solvent model44,45 with a dielectric constant of
80. The iPol approach used in AMBER ff15ipq is then employed, with
all nonbonded parameters set halfway between their vacuum and condensed
phase values.2 The purpose of this approach,
as well as overcoming issues associated with closing of the electronic
band gap in large system sizes,46 is to
account for electrostatics and induction in the condensed phase in
an effective manner using a fixed point charge force field.47 Typical computational requirements for a QM
calculation on a small protein (≈1000 atoms) are approximately
2000 cpu-h. In order to provide a consistent and computationally efficient
approach to assigning the nonbonded parameters, we recommend minimizing
the experimental structure using a standard transferable force field
in explicit water prior to the DFT calculation. In this study, we
used the OPLS-AA/M force field for the initial minimization.

the steps required to assign the QUBE protein
force field. Blue is used for nonbonded terms, and yellow is used
for bonded terms.

Following nonbonded parameter
assignment, bond, angle, and torsional
parameters were assigned as described in Section 2 based on the OPLS-AA/M atom types. For torsion
and improper types not reparameterized in this study, OPLS-AA/M parameters
are retained.1,7Table 1 summarizes the number of bespoke nonbonded
parameters for each protein studied, along with the bonded parameters
that are parametrized using the dipeptide molecules as described above.
All parameters, including atom-specific nonbonded parameters, are
written to a CHARMM-style parameter file. The psf, pdb, and inp files
are provided in the Supporting Information. We note that preparation of the parameter files is fully automated,
and scripts and step-by-step tutorials are available from https://github.com/cole-group/QUBEMAKER. MD simulations were performed using the NAMD software, using input
parameters detailed elsewhere (Section S2.1).1 Statistics were collected over a period
of 200 ns for dipeptides, Ala5, and Gly3 and
0.5 μs for the proteins. All MD simulations were performed in
triplicate.

3.2.2 Simulation Analysis
All backbone
and sidechain dihedral angles sampled during the dipeptide simulations
were analyzed and compared with experimental data (Section S2.4). The simulated J coupling was
calculated using the Karplus equation 7  where
ϕ is the relevant
dihedral angle, and A, B, and C are the Karplus parameters, which can be derived from
experimental measurements or QM calculations.48 For the alanine pentapeptide, the J coupling error
is calculated as 8  where ⟨Jj⟩sim is the time-averaged
simulated J coupling, Jj,exp is the experimental J coupling,
σ is the
estimated systematic error,48 and N is the number of J coupling measurements
considered.

The backbone J coupling term 3J(HN, Hα) was calculated from the dipeptide simulations using the Karplus
parameters proposed in ref (49) and the ϕ dihedral angles sampled, with the experimental J coupling values taken from ref (49). The sidechains sampled were separated into
P(+60°), T(180°), and M(−60°) rotamers, and
the populations of each were then compared to protein coil library
data.1

The J coupling
values computed from the alanine
and glycine peptide simulations could be compared to multiple experimental
values given in ref (51). Three separate Karplus parameter sets were used as given in ref (48).

The Karplus parameters
used for the protein simulations came from
multiple sources, with both refs (49) and (52) used for backbone parameters. Methyl sidechain Karplus
parameters are also supplied in ref (52), and ref (53) was used for all other sidechain Karplus parameters.

4 Results
4.1 Torsional Parameter Fitting
The final
backbone torsional parameters and associated errors in the recreation
of the QM energy scans are given in Section S3.2 of the Supporting Information. For the alanine and glycine scans,
the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93
kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement.
For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.

For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean
error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE
force field is 1.29 kcal/mol compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M.
Particularly high errors occur for both the χ1 and
χ2 glutamic acid scans and the glutamine χ2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M
force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close
to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the
functional form used in classical force fields.1 The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine
is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will
show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good,
and so, no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional
parameters in this work.

Although a low error in the reproduction
of the QM potential energy
surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond
to accurate nonbonded force field parameters. The degree to which
torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends
not only on the accuracy of the nonbonded and bond and angle parameters
but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and
MM scans. The functional form used in classical MM force fields is
very restrictive. However, the energy difference between the QM and
MM energy scans must be corrected by the functional form for low errors
to be achieved. Therefore, although we use errors in potential energy
scans as a guide to performance, they cannot be relied upon as a measure
of the accuracy of a force field. Therefore, we now investigate the
performance of the QUBE force field in MD simulations.

4.2 Dipeptide Simulations
Extensive MD
simulations were performed for each of the dipeptides. Computed NMR J couplings provide a quantative measure of the accuracy
of the backbone ϕ torsion angle distribution sampled during
the MD simulations. The full results are shown in Table S8. The QUBE
force field achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.42 Hz, which
can be compared to 0.35 Hz for OPLS-AA/M.1 Encouragingly, the error in the J couplings simulated
using the QUBE force field is much lower than that of OPLS-AA (0.97
Hz) and OPLS-AA/L (0.79 Hz).1 With the
arginine dipeptide excluded from the QUBE data, the error drops further
to 0.33 Hz. Residue-specific arginine backbone torsional parameters
could be computed, however, given that the ϕ/ψ distribution
of arginine occupies the main conformations expected, this is not
investigated in this work.

Figure 3 shows the collective ϕ/ψ distributions
from the dipeptide MD simulations, along with the main expected protein
conformational propensities.54 As discussed
in Section S9 of the Supporting Information,
it is important to consider the dihedral distributions present as
well as the J coupling data. Encouragingly, the ϕ/ψ
distribution for the dipeptides shows that the major conformations
present in protein structures are sampled in the QUBE MD simulations.
The ζ conformation does have a slightly lower ψ angle
than suggested, and there is an additional region with very low occupancy
to the right of the γ conformation. However, these are very
small discrepancies.

Figure 3 (a) ϕ/ψ distribution extracted from the dipeptide
MD
simulations, plotted in the form – log (pψ, ϕ) (where pψ, ϕ is the probability of a region being occupied). The lighter regions
correspond to low probability areas including conformations that are
not sampled during the simulation. (b) Major conformations observed
in protein structures.54 The right-handed
α-helical region is labeled as δ and the left-handed α-helical
region as δ′.

The ϕ/ψ distributions for each individual dipeptide
are shown in Section S4.2 of the Supporting
Information. Generally, similar areas of the ϕ/ψ distribution
are occupied by all the dipeptides. The serine and threonine dipeptides
do not sample identical regions to the other dipeptides, which is
expected given that they have a separate set of backbone torsional
parameters. There are several dipeptides that show populations of
left-handed α-helical conformation. High left-handed helical
populations have previously caused problems for other force fields.55 However, since the occupancy of PPII and β
regions always remain higher than the populations of the left-handed
α-helical region, reducing the left-handed helical population
was not considered a priority in this work. The right-handed α-helical
populations are small for all the dipeptides. This is in agreement
with experimental results.50

As well
as the backbone conformations sampled, the sidechain rotamer
populations were also analyzed. In Figure 4, the simulated rotamer populations are compared
to experimental data taken from protein coil libraries (the data are
given in the Supporting Information of ref (1)). Given that the experimental data are not specific
to dipeptides, perfect agreement is not expected. However, populations
at extreme values would cause concern, and a correlation between the
experimental and simulated values is favorable. Figure 4 shows that no dipeptides have populations
consisting of just one type of rotamer and there are no extremely
high values (as was observed for OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L1). The rotamer M populations are occasionally slightly lower
than expected. However, given the issues previously mentioned with
the experimental data used, further changes were not made to adjust
the outliers.

Figure 4 Comparison of the rotamer populations for the dipeptide
MD simulations
and experimental values from the protein coil library. The dashed
lines show the populations that fall within ±20% of the experimental
values.

The rotamer data, which were used
to construct Figure 4, are reproduced in Table S9.
With an MUE of 14%, QUBE performs better than both OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L,
which have errors of 23 and 21%, respectively.1 The error is not as low as OPLS-AA/M, which has an error of 10%,
however with further empirical changes to the torsional parameters,
the error could likely be further reduced. Examining individual dipeptide
errors, protonated histidine and aspartic acid are found to have the
highest errors. The protonated histidine experimental data includes
all ionization states of histidine and therefore may not be accurate,
which would explain the high error. The higher error in the simulated
dynamics of the aspartic acid dipeptide is more problematic, and in
future versions of the QUBE force field, further changes to these
sidechain torsional parameters may be considered.

4.3 Peptide Simulations
The J coupling
errors extracted from MD simulations of the alanine pentapeptide
are shown in Table 2, with the ϕ/ψ distribution shown in Figure 5, and further results given
in Section S5.1 of the Supporting Information.
Three sets of Karplus parameters are used to evaluate the error, and
the values in parentheses exclude the 2J(N, Cα) coupling term. Issues with the 2J(N, Cα) coupling Karplus parameters
are discussed in Section S9 of the Supporting
Information and elsewhere.1,2 The J coupling error for set 1 is very encouraging and is lower than both
the OPLS-AA/M (1.16 ± 0.02) and AMOEBA force field errors (0.99).1,5 The errors for sets 2 and 3 with the excluded 2J(N, Cα) term are similar in value. In
the simulations carried out in this work, as well as the work of Amber
ff15ipq and OPLS-AA/M, the low β backbone populations present
result in a high 2J(N, Cα) error for the second and third set of Karplus parameters.1,2 The pentapeptide conformation with the largest population is PPII
with 62 ± 2% of the simulation spent in this conformation (Table S11). This is similar to the conformational
propensity observed for OPLS-AA/M (53.5 ± 0.2%). Both force fields
also result in a low α-helical population, which is consistent
with experimental data.15

alanine pentapeptide, plotted in the form – log (pψ, ϕ) (where pψ, ϕ is the probability of a region being occupied). The lighter regions

The problems associated
with using the Karplus parameters for Gly3 are discussed
in Section S9 of
the Supporting Information and elsewhere.1,51,56 Therefore, we evaluate the backbone conformations
of Gly3 through its ϕ/ψ distribution alone.
In Figure 6, the OPLS-AA/M
backbone conformational distribution is compared to that obtained
using the QUBE force field. A lower α-helical population is
occupied by the QUBE force field, but otherwise both distributions
are very similar.

(all
residues are included) using (a) QUBE force field and (b) OPLS-AA/M,
plotted in the form – log (pψ, ϕ) (where pψ, ϕ is the
probability of a region being occupied). The lighter regions correspond
to low probability areas including conformations that are not sampled
during the simulation.

The MD simulations presented
here have demonstrated that the QUBE
force field and the parameterization methods used to create it are
sufficiently accurate to recreate conformational propensities of short,
flexible peptides. The errors in the simulated dynamics of these molecules
are comparable to OPLS-AA/M, and the ϕ/ψ distributions
demonstrate that the major conformations observed in protein structures
are populated. Issues with the transferability of torsional parameters
have already been identified from the longer peptide simulations and
are solved by applying regularization. In the following subsection,
the performance of QUBE for entire proteins is evaluated to demonstrate
the feasibility of applying the methodology to macromolecules and
to further understand the intricacies of fitting torsional parameters
to a system-specific force field.

4.4 Protein
Dynamics
The use of system-specific
nonbonded parameters for biomolecular force fields allows for long-ranged
polarization effects to be included, which is expected to improve
the accuracy of the force field, particularly for measurements such
as protein–ligand binding affinity that are sensitive to the
electrostatic potential at the protein surface. A comparison of the
QUBE and OPLS nonbonded parameters for ubiquitin is shown in Figure 7. Figures for the
other proteins tested follow similar trends. As we have described,
QUBE nonbonded parameters are derived directly from the QM partitioned
electron density, and so, each atom has a unique charge and set of
Lennard-Jones coefficients, which depend on its environment. In contrast,
the OPLS parameters are read from a library of atom types. The QUBE
and OPLS charges correlate well with no clear outliers. As has previously
been observed,24 the QUBE Lennard-Jones
parameters show a far greater level of variation than OPLS (and most
other force fields).

Figure 7 Comparison of the QUBE and OPLS nonbonded parameters for
ubiquitin.
The regions circled corresponding to carbonyl carbon atoms, which
are expected to be electron deficient and therefore require small A and B Lennard-Jones coefficients.24 Blue and dashed black lines represent lines
of best fit and y = x, respectively.

One assumption employed in the use of system-specific
charges for
proteins (and small molecules) is that the derived parameter set is
not too dependent on the molecular conformation. To investigate this
assumption, the sensitivity of the nonbonded parameters, for the GB3
protein, to the choice of the input structure is investigated in Section
S6.2. Ten structures were extracted from an MD simulation employing
the OPLS-AA/M force field, and QUBE nonbonded parameters were computed
for each snapshot. The standard deviation of the charge distribution
across the ensemble is just 0.02 e, supporting previous observations
that the underlying DDEC AIM charges are relatively independent of
conformation.27,34

It is important to test
whether these system-specific force field
parameters translate into more accurate protein interactions and dynamics.
In this regard, although the conformational preferences of the peptides
tested in the previous section are promising, it is not known whether
the torsional parameters will continue to be appropriate for use with
proteins. As the nonbonded parameters vary with the system studied,
the transferability of torsional parameters cannot be readily assumed.
To assess this, we begin by studying MD simulations of the proteins
ubiquitin and GB3.

The J coupling errors for
ubiquitin and GB3 are
summarized in Table 3. With an overall RMSE of 1.54 Hz, the error using the QUBE force
field for ubiquitin is higher than that of OPLS-AA/M, which has an
RMSE of 1.12 Hz, but lower than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L with errors
of 1.84 and 1.70 Hz, respectively.1 GB3
follows the same trend with an RMSE of 1.10 Hz for the QUBE force
field, compared to the error for OPLS-AA/M of 0.90 Hz, while OPLS-AA
and OPLS-AA/L both have an error of 1.46 Hz.1

Table 3 J Coupling Errors
for the Proteins Ubiquitin and GB3

couplings (Hz)	sidechain coupling (Hz)	overall	
protein	1997 values	2007 values	3J(Hα, Hβ)	3J(C′, Cγ)	methyl Cγ	RMSE (Hz)	
ubiquitin	0.94 ± 0.07	1.15 ± 0.05	2.40 ± 0.11	1.16 ± 0.20	1.20 ± 0.05	1.54 ± 0.07	
GB3	0.93 ± 0.05	1.03 ± 0.05	1.80 ± 0.05	 	0.84 ± 0.02	1.10 ± 0.04	
The J coupling results suggest that while the
transfer of torsional parameters from dipeptides to proteins may cause
some issues, the QUBE force field remains more accurate than OPLS-AA
and OPLS-AA/L. This is promising when we consider that OPLS has been
in development for many years with multiple iterations and parameter
adjustments performed. The 3J(Hα, Hβ) coupling term is the main contributor to the J coupling error. For GB3, the 3J(Hα, Hβ) error for the QUBE force
field is 1.80 Hz, this is well below the errors for OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L
of 3.71 and 3.38 Hz, respectively.

However, as discussed in Section S9 of
the Supporting Information, the J coupling error
should not be used as the only measure of force field accuracy. To
further test the performance of the QUBE force field, we compared
the ϕ/ψ torsion angle distributions and root mean square
deviation (RMSD) of the backbone Cα atoms of each
residue from the experimental crystal structure for five proteins
(Section S7 of the Supporting Information).
The dihedral angles of the experimental structure are shown on each
ϕ/ψ plot and these experimental points, along with the
previous data for AMBER ff15ipq (the ϕ/ψ plots are given
in the Supporting Information of ref (2)), are used to evaluate the performance of the
force field. Figure 8 shows the five proteins tested, with the residue labels indicating
the main regions that deviated from the crystal structure during simulation.

Figure 8 Experimental
structures of the proteins tested. Regions that showed
the most significant deviation from the experimental structure in
the simulations are labeled. The red-white-blue color gradient represents
the residue number.

Figure 9 shows the
average RMSD of the Cα atoms of
the five proteins from the experimental crystal structures over the
course of the simulation. Each line represents an average over three
separate MD trajectories. Both GB3 (PDB: 1P7E) and ubiquitin (PDB: 1UBQ) remain close to
the experimental structure for the first 100 ns of the simulation,
although there is some increase in RMSD to around 2–3 Å
over the second half of the simulation.

Figure 9 Mean RMSD, relative to
the experimental structures, from the MD
simulations of the five proteins tested.

The ϕ/ψ distributions of GB3 (Figure S8) and the RMSD per residue (Figure S7) help us to further analyze the results. Residues, which deviate
from the experimental structure, and the results from the AMBER ff15ipq
force field also tend to have high J coupling errors.
For example, residues 8–21 have a large deviation from the
experimental structure, and this is reflected by high J coupling errors in this region. The backbone J coupling
error, using the 2007 Karplus parameters, for residues 8–21
is 2.00 Hz, which is almost double the total backbone error. This
region corresponds to a β-sheet, which separates over the second
half of the MD trajectory and contributes to the increased backbone
RMSD. Aside from this region, the only other residues, which show
noticeable deviation from the crystal structure, are Val39, Asp40,
Gly41, and Thr55. However, the small deviations that are present in
these four residues are also observed in simulations using the AMBER
ff15ipq force field.2

Deviations
between the simulated ubiquitin dynamics and experiment
tend to be confined to regions without clear secondary structures.
Often this is of little concern since both experimental NMR measurements
and simulations with the AMBER force field also indicate flexibility
in these regions (e.g., residues 7–11 and 72–74). However,
deviations from the crystal structure in the disordered region between
residues 54–66 are more of a concern and contribute to the
high J coupling and rising RMSD of the protein backbone
over the second half of the simulation.

In contrast, Figure 9 shows that both
the villin headpiece (PDB: 2F4K) and BPTI (PDB:
5PTI) retain their experimental structures extremely well (average
RMSD in the range of 1–2 Å). The three α-helices
present in the villin headpiece are retained throughout the simulations,
and the ϕ/ψ distributions are in excellent agreement with
experiment and the AMBER force field (Figure S10). Similarly, in BPTI, regions with helical or β-sheet structures
retain their structure. Some small changes in the structure are observed
(for example, residues 10–12 in villin and 36–40 in
BPTI), although these correspond to regions with no fixed secondary
structure or a bend.

We have also included in Figure 9 the protein binase (PDB: 1BUJ).
This is an interesting
test case as the experimental NMR structural ensemble reveals a high
degree of residue flexibility, with loops that adopt multiple conformations
(Figure S12), but it is also challenging.
The two α-helices present in 1BUJ, around residues 10 and 30,
are generally well represented with the QUBE force field. However,
in regions with no structure, a bend, or a turn, significant deviations
from experiment are observed, and the RMSD reaches extremely high
values. By way of comparison, the backbone RMSD using the AMBER ff15ipq
force field was 3.4 Å after 10 μs of simulation and, after
0.5 μs, was approximately 3 Å. In the AMBER ff15ipq work,
the high RMSD was attributed to variability in the loop regions, which
had also been observed in experimental structures.2 Closer examination of the ϕ/ψ distributions
of each residue reveals the difficulty of capturing accurate conformational
preferences. For example, the NMR ensemble for Lys38 shows the presence
of both β-sheet and α-helical conformations. These are
also observed in MD simulations using both AMBER ff15ipq and the QUBE
force field, but the proportion of each conformation is different.
The ensemble of Ser66 is not well represented with AMBER ff15ipq,
but with the QUBE force field, all structures in the ensemble are
captured to some degree, although an additional α-helical conformation
is also observed.

Table 4 summarizes
the performance of the QUBE protein force field across the peptide
and protein data sets presented in this study and compares it with
analogous assessments of the OPLS force fields studied previously.1 Overall, QUBE outperforms legacy OPLS-AA and
OPLS-AA/L force fields but is less accurate (with the exception of
alanine pentapeptide simulations) than the latest OPLS-AA/M force
field. This is an encouraging result for this first generation protein-specific
force field but also indicates that there is room for improvement
of QUBE within the fixed functional form of the biomolecular force
field. The next section summarizes our roadmap for future development
and application of the QUBE force field.

5 Discussion and Conclusions
The assumption that biomolecular
force fields must be parametrized
against the experimental properties of small molecules has persisted
since MM simulations began and remains in all force fields under widespread
use.6,57,58 In this work,
we look to challenge this assumption by deriving system-specific nonbonded
parameters, from linear-scaling QM simulations, for consistency with
the QUBE small-molecule force field. These nonbonded terms were used
here alongside libraries of (nonbespoke) bond and angle parameters,
derived using the modified Seminario method,30 and newly reparametrized torsional terms.

We have shown here
that using system-specific nonbonded force field
parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short
peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings
for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental
data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer
peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional
parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent.
Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome
these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of
just 0.90 ± 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating
disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is. The accuracy
of the peptide simulations supports the use of our nonbonded and modified
Seminario bonded parametrization strategies. In protein MD simulations,
the RMSD of the backbone atoms relative to experimental structures
remained low, below 2 Å, for two of the five proteins tested.
The α-helices present in all of the proteins generally remained
close to the experimental structures, but the β-sheets exhibited
greater loss of structure, and regions with no clear structure or
exhibiting a turn regularly deviated from the starting structure.
These regions also contributed greatest to J coupling
errors. Despite this, the majority of the regions in the proteins
retained their experimental structure, and the J coupling
errors for GB3 and ubiquitin were below those of OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L,
two force fields regularly used in biomolecular modeling studies.

While developing QUBE, manual adjustments to some torsional parameters
were required. This was also required in the development of OPLS-AA/M,
and we can infer from this that automatically fitting backbone and
sidechain torsional parameters using dihedral energy scans is still
challenging. The most obvious failure of dihedral energy scan fitting
was that for a number of sidechains it was more accurate to set the
torsional parameters to zero than to use the originally derived terms.
This is in part due to the functional form used, with potential improvements
to this discussed below, but is also due to the poor sampling of relevant
structures by scanning one or two dihedral angles at a time. This
problem is reduced by the iterative fitting methods used in AMBER
ff14ipq and ff15ipq,2,38 which sample the structures used
for torsional parameter fitting by performing MD simulations with
the current iteration of the force field. This approach will be considered
in future versions of the force field.

Another potential source
of error is the choice of the modified
Seminario method for derivation of bond and angle force constants.
However, this method has been shown to accurately reproduce QM vibrational
frequencies30 and, importantly, also reproduce
QM intramolecular potential energy surfaces of drug-like molecules
when combined with the QUBE nonbonded and torsional parameters.25

There are also additional considerations
involved in using a library
of torsional parameters alongside system-specific nonbonded parameters.
The torsional parameters are fit using one set of nonbonded parameters
but are then used for a range of environment-dependent nonbonded terms.
This is likely the reason
for the importance of regularization in this study. During the sidechain
torsional parameter fitting process, it was observed that the optimal
torsional parameters for α-helical and β-sheet backbone
conformations can vary greatly. It may be possible to address this
issue by changing the functional form of the torsional component of
the force field. The functional form currently used is inaccurate
due to the parameter dependency on only a single dihedral angle. The
coupling between torsional terms has been addressed in a number of
different ways.59−62 These include the use of the CMAP term in CHARMM22, a grid-based
correction used to improve the backbone torsional energetics.61 Extending the CMAP correction so it is dependent
on the χ1 sidechain dihedral angle has also recently
been investigated.62 The functional form
could also be improved by adding a torsion–torsion coupling
term as employed in previous studies.60

Importantly, the flexibility of the QUBE parametrization process
means that changes to the torsional parameters are not the only alterations
that could be made to improve the accuracy of the benchmark validation
tests studied here. It is not just protein–protein interactions
that determine the structure but also interactions with the water
model. In particular, the balance between electrostatic and dispersive
interactions has been shown to be crucial.63,64 Interactions between the QUBE force field and the TIP3P water model
may be responsible for some of the instabilities in the structure
that we have observed, and development of a QUBE water model may lead
to improved dynamics and computed free energies of hydration.25 An advantage of using a parametrization scheme
that depends almost entirely on QM data is that alterations to the
parametrization strategy or functional form can be readily inserted
into the existing workflow. There is future scope for improvement
in the choice of exchange-correlation functional used to derive nonbonded
parameters, for example, through the use of hybrid functionals,65 the choice of electron density partitioning
methods,66 or the addition of off-center
charges to model electron anisotropy effects.25 More fundamentally, we have the opportunity to investigate improvements
to the functional form of the force field itself, for example, by
adding higher order dispersion terms beyond the dipole–dipole
interaction37,66,67 or by altering the short-range repulsion term.37 A future QUBE polarizable force field is also envisaged,
and toward this goal, the derivation of accurate AIM atomic polarizabilities
is under investigation.68

As presented
in the Results section, the
general picture that emerges is that this first generation quantum
mechanical bespoke force field is an improvement over legacy OPLS-AA
and OPLS-AA/L force fields but is outperformed by the most recent
OPLS-AA/M force field for simulated dynamics of folded proteins in
their native state. While we have previously shown that DDEC charges
are not too dependent on small conformation changes,28 further investigation is needed to establish the utility
of QUBE for protein folding simulations. Hence, although we have outlined
our roadmap to future improvements, a natural question is where can
the QUBE protein force field be used now (especially given the higher
cost of parameterization compared to transferable force fields)? Importantly,
it has been shown previously that the use of system-specific force
field charges leads to improvements in binding energetics of small
molecules8 and reproduction of the QM electrostatic
potential for both small molecules27 and
proteins.34 Therefore, although simulated
protein backbone dynamics is an important test, we envisage the QUBE
small-molecule and protein force field being particularly important
for the study of intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase.
Indeed, QUBE was originally developed to provide, by construction,
a compatible protein and small-molecule force field for computer-aided
drug design where an accurate surface electrostatic potential of the
protein is crucial. In this regard, the absolute binding free energies
between the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme and six benzene analogs have
been recently computed using QUBE with a mean unsigned error of 0.85
kcal/mol, which compares very favorably with OPLS-AA/M (1.26 kcal/mol).69 Although further work is required to establish
this accuracy across a significantly wider range of protein–ligand
complexes, the promise of these initial biomolecular simulation results
indicate a viable pathway toward improved protein dynamics and interactions
using quantum mechanical bespoke force fields.
