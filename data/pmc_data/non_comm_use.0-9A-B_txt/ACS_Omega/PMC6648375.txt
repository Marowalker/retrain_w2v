Thermo-catalytic
conversion of cellulosic feedstock, such as lignocellulose,
to platform chemicals offers a renewable alternative to fossil-based
chemicals. Mechanistic insights behind thermochemical conversion of
lignocellulose would facilitate thermo-catalytic process development
for bio-based chemicals. This study employed synchrotron-based Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy to investigate chemical
changes in acid-catalyzed cellulose and lignocellulose and glucose
during pyrolysis. Major changes in glucose occurred at 200 °C,
where it underwent reactions including ring opening and tautomerization.
Acid treatment did not change the molecular structure of cellulose
but disrupted the lignocellulose network. The observed synchrotron
FTIR spectral features provided evidence for acceleration of catalytic
dehydration of cellulose and lignocellulose to levoglucosenone and
furans. Catalytic passivation of alkali and alkaline earth metals
in lignocellulose was also observed at low acid concentration.

1 Introduction
Renewable
sources for energy and chemicals are gaining favor in
the wake of environmental anomalies caused by inordinate usage of
fossils. Conversion of lignocellulose to chemicals is one renewable
option for gradually replacing fossil-based chemicals and chemical
precursors. Producing chemicals from lignocellulose could bolster
the economic viability of biorefineries.1 Lignocellulose conversion to chemicals can be achieved through biochemical,
chemo-catalytic, and thermochemical routes.2 The thermochemical route, albeit non-selective, offers one step
lignocellulose conversion to platform chemicals. The selectivity of
this method can be enhanced by employing suitable catalysts into the
process.3−5

Understanding the reactions involved in thermochemical
conversion
of cellulose and lignocellulose is critical to select the most appropriate
catalysts for optimal yield and selectivity. There are studies that
used acid catalysts (Brønsted and Lewis) to increase the yield
of the platform chemicals during thermo-catalytic conversion. Dobele
et al. studied the effect of phosphoric acid on the yield of levoglucosan
and levoglucosenone during thermochemical conversion.6,7 The mitigation of inhibitory effects of alkali and alkaline earth
metals (AAEMs) by mineral acids has also been investigated.8 In another study, the catalytic effect of sulfuric
acid was shown to boost the yield of levoglucosenone9 from lignocellulose. The role of hydrogen chloride as a
catalyst and co-reactant for converting lignocellulose to levoglucosenone,
levulinic acid, and substituted furans has also been investigated.10,11 Several other studies used sulfated zirconia,12 sulfated titania,13 ZSM-5-based
catalyst,14 and solid phosphoric acid3 to convert lignocellulose to chemicals. However,
a few studies elaborately investigated the structural and chemical
changes that occur in cellulose and lignocellulose treated with acid.

Zheng et al. investigated the chemical changes that occur in the
constituents of lignocellulose during torrefaction.15 However, that study does not illustrate the chemical changes
that occur in the acid-treated feedstock. Similarly, other studies
elucidate the functional group changes in woody16,17 and algal biomass18 during thermochemical
conversion but not for the feedstock treated with acid. Mayes et al.
used quantum mechanics calculations to illustrate the reaction pathways
involved in the thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) of glucose,19 and Jadhav et al. determined the reaction rates
to investigate the intermediates during glucose conversion to furans.20 There is still limited, particularly spectroscopic,
information on chemical changes that occur in acid-treated cellulose
and lignocellulose which yield more anhydrosugars like levoglucosenone
and furans.

Accordingly, in this study, we used synchrotron
Fourier transform
microspectroscopy to investigate the changes in functional groups
and the molecular structure of raw and acid-treated cellulose and
lignocellulose at different temperatures during thermochemical conversion
(pyrolysis). The thermal breakdown of glucose and the observed changes
in functional groups were studied to gain insights into the mechanism
of cellulose and lignocellulose conversion and the formation of platform
chemicals (levoglucosenone and furans). Based on the observed spectral
features, we have elucidated the reaction pathways that cellulose
undergoes during pyrolysis. The mechanism behind the higher yield
of levoglucosenone and furans from acid-catalysed cellulose and lignocellulose
is also discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Functional Group Changes in Cellulose on Acid
Treatment
Figure 1a presents the synchrotron FTIR spectra of microcrystalline
cellulose and acid-treated cellulose taken at ambient temperature.
The acid treatment resulted in minor changes in the functional group
vibrations of cellulose that are shown in Figure 1b. The peak at 1370 cm–1 (C–H vibration) shifted to 1360 cm–1 for
cellulose treated with 0.1 M and higher concentration of acid. Similarly,
the peak at 1340 cm–1 (O–H vibration) shifted
to 1330 cm–1. The shift of these two peaks could
be due to the breakage of inter- and intra-chain hydrogen bonds depicted
as dotted lines in Figure 1c. The treatment of cellulose with high concentration of acid
(≥0.1 M) cleaved the hydrogen bond but did not cleave the covalent
bonds inside the cellulose. The presence of peaks at 1100 and 900
cm–1 (ring vibrations) implies that the acid treatment
of cellulose did not cleave any bond in the ring structure. Table 1 shows the assignment
of the peaks found in the synchrotron FTIR spectra.21−23

2.2 Changes
in Functional Groups Observed during
Pyrolysis of Cellulose and Acid-Treated Cellulose
Figure 2 shows the synchrotron
FTIR spectra of cellulose and changes in functional groups observed
for cellulose during pyrolysis. The peaks presented at ∼3400,
1330, and 1200 cm–1 correspond to O–H stretching
vibrations. The C–H stretch is represented by the peaks at
2900, 1430, 1370, and 1280 cm–1. The peaks at 1230,
1060, and 1030 cm–1 are attributed to C–O
vibrations, while the peak at 1160 cm–1 is attributed
to the C–O–C stretching mode. The ring valence vibrations
led to the peaks at 1110 and 895 cm–1.

Figure 2 Synchrotron
FTIR spectra observed during thermal breakdown of cellulose.

The in situ monitoring of changes
in the molecular structure of
cellulose was performed at different temperatures from 30 to 500 °C.
The peak at 1640 cm–1 corresponds to adsorbed water
molecules and this bound water started to disappear at 100 °C
as the cellulose particles were heated. The depolymerization of cellulose
was observed to commence at 250 °C. The peaks at 1320 cm–1 (C–H stretch) and 1230 cm–1 (C–O stretch) started to diminish at 250 °C and disappeared
at 300 °C. The depolymerization was followed by dehydration reactions
at 350 °C. The appearance of peak at 1690 cm–1 suggested the presence of compounds with C=O groups, which
could be furans and other anhydrosugars. With further increase in
temperature, the peaks at 1160 cm–1 (C–O–C)
and 1100 cm–1 (glucose ring vibration) disappeared.
The breakage of the C–O–C bond and disappearance of
glucose ring vibration suggested that the disruption of the cellulose
structure occurred at 400 °C. At this temperature, there was
also an additional peak at 1590 cm–1 attributed
to the aromatic skeletal vibration and C=O stretch.15,22 The aromatic vibration, in particular, represents molecular evidence
for the existence of carbonization of cellulose and formation of a
benzene ring.24 Additionally, the presence
of the peak at 1690 cm–1 (C=O) at 400 °C
implies the presence of carbonyl compounds. These compounds undergo
further fragmentation, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation to liberate
light gases25 which can be observed through
the decreasing intensity of this peak at higher temperatures. Based
on the synchrotron FTIR spectral data, it could be concluded that
cellulose pyrolysis starts with the loss of adsorbed water, followed
by depolymerization and subsequently a dehydration reaction that results
in the formation of furans and anhydrosugars. A further increase in
temperature results in a series of simultaneous reactions including
fragmentation, carbonization, and re-polymerization that lead to char
formation and liberation of light gases.

To understand the effect
of acid on these reactions, the in situ
synchrotron FTIR measurement was performed on acid-treated cellulose. Figure 3a shows synchrotron
FTIR spectra of cellulose treated with 0.05 M HCl observed at different
temperatures, suggesting that the onset of depolymerization occurred
at 250 °C at which the peaks at 1320 cm–1 (CH
stretch) and 1230 cm–1 (C–O stretch) started
to diminish. The acid treatment accelerated the dehydration reaction
as evidenced by the strong intensity of C=O vibrational modes
at 1710 and 1650 cm–1 at 350 °C, compared to
that of cellulose without acid treatment. In addition, the peaks found
in the range of 1560–1510 cm–1 (i.e. aromatic
skeletal vibrations) shown in Figure 3b, indicate the onset of carbonization of cellulose
at 350 °C.26 The early onset of aromatization
is caused by the acceleration of dehydration reactions as a result
of acid treatment. The fragmentation of these carbonyl compounds produced
smaller organic oxygenated molecules, supported by an increase in
the intensity of the peaks at 1700 and 1590 cm–1 at 400 °C. Such molecular evidence also agrees well with the
appearance of the vibrations around 1430 cm–1, corresponding
to C–O–H bending modes. The disappearance of C–O–C
and C–O vibrations confirms the breakage of the chain structure
that led to the formation of smaller organic molecules. With further
rise in temperature, light gases were evolved and the intensity of
the peaks 1700 and 1590 cm–1 increased before they
eventually diminished at 550 °C.

Figure 3 (a) Synchrotron FTIR spectra observed
during thermal breakdown
of cellulose treated with 0.05 M hydrochloric acid. (b) Changes in
spectral features showing acceleration of dehydration and charring
reactions in cellulose treated with 0.05 M hydrochloric acid.

Figure 4a–c
illustrate synchrotron FTIR spectra of cellulose treated with higher
concentration of acid. The spectral changes observed for cellulose
treated with 2 and 4 M acid are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2, respectively. Higher concentration
of acid was found to accelerate dehydration and charring reactions.
The vibration of the C=O bond started to appear at 300 °C
during thermal breakdown of cellulose, which was treated with ≥0.5
M acid. Figure 5 highlights
the early appearance of C=O vibration for cellulose treated
with 0.5 M acid. Peaks representing other functional groups, including
C–O, C–H, and O–H, started to diminish at lower
temperature (from 350 °C and lower) for cellulose treated with
higher concentration of acid (greater than 0.5 M). This implies that
increasing the concentration of acid accelerates the fragmentation
and scission reactions.

thermal breakdown
of cellulose treated with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. (b) Synchrotron
FTIR spectra observed during thermal breakdown of cellulose treated

during thermal breakdown of cellulose treated with 1 M hydrochloric
acid.

Figure 5 Changes in spectral features showing the early
onset of dehydration
and depolymerization reactions in cellulose treated with 0.5 M hydrochloric
acid at 350 °C.

Accordingly, based on the synchrotron FTIR results, in this
study,
it was observed that pyrolysis of cellulose began with depolymerization
(at 250 °C), followed by dehydration (from 350 °C). The
dehydration reactions resulted in the formation of anhydrosugars and
a further increase in temperature led to breakage of bonds that produce
smaller organic molecules and light gases. This observation is in
good agreement with the previous literature.25 The aromatization of cellulose was observed to occur at higher temperatures
(400 °C onwards) which is consistent with previously published
results.26 Treating cellulose with high
concentration acid accelerated the dehydration reaction, resulting
in the formation of carbonyl compounds at a lower temperature (300
°C). The accelerated dehydration also results in the higher yield
of platform chemicals (e.g. anhydrosugars like levoglucosenone and
furans) at low temperature similar to those observed in the earlier
study.27 It is evident from the FTIR spectra
that higher concentration of acid also resulted in fragmentation and
scission of organics at a lower temperature (350 °C) and early
aromatization of cellulose. Shafizadeh and Fu28 detected glucose in cellulose pyrolysis and there is a possibility
of formation of cellulose pyrolytic products via a transient glucose
form.29 Hence, after investigating cellulose
pyrolysis and obtaining insights on the different types of associated
reactions, we investigated cellulose dehydration in detail through
the changes in spectral features obtained during glucose pyrolysis.

2.3 Functional Group Changes during Pyrolysis
of Glucose
Figure 6a,b depicts the synchrotron FTIR spectra of glucose. As described
in Table 2, the synchrotron
FTIR spectra of glucose present peaks associated to O–H groups
(3400–3300, 1365, 1350, 1220, and 1200 cm–1), C–H stretches (2950–2890, 1430, 1406, and 1300 cm–1), C–O vibration (1100, 1080, and 1030 cm–1), and C–O–C stretches (1150 cm–1).

Changes in
functional groups of glucose during thermal breakdown
are presented in Figure 7a–c. There was no change in the functional groups until 100
°C (shown in Supporting Information Figure S3). The O–H stretching vibration between 3400 and
3300 cm–1 became noisy at 150 °C, with new
peaks found at 1460, 1270, and 1120 cm–1. Figure 8 shows the difference
between the synchrotron FTIR spectra of d-glucose and d-fructose. The peaks at 1460 and 1270 cm–1 are characteristic of fructose and are absent in the spectra of
glucose. The appearance of these peaks during thermal breakdown of
glucose is indicative of the commencement of isomerization of glucose.

in spectral features observed for glucose started at
150 °C. (b) Synchrotron FTIR spectra observed during thermal
breakdown of d-glucose between 300 and 400 °C. (c) Synchrotron
FTIR spectra observed during thermal breakdown of d-glucose

of fructose, while the black arrows represent the peaks characteristic
of glucose. The peaks with asterisk are the ones found in glucose
during thermal breakdown at 150 °C.

The major changes in the glucose structure were observed
at 200
°C. First, the peaks at 1370, 1230, and 1200 cm–1 vanished due to loss of O–H groups. Next, the vibrations
for the C–H group (1430 cm–1) and C–O
group (1100–1010 cm–1) also disappeared.
Finally, there was disappearance of the C–H vibrational mode
at 2910 cm–1. The loss of these functional groups
could be due to dehydration reactions at higher temperature.19,29 The peak at 1140 cm–1 (C–O–C vibration)
is indicative of dehydration, which led to the formation of levoglucosan.
There are peaks associated to C=O vibrations as well at 200
°C, which could be due to ring opening and keto–enol tautomerization20 that lead to the formation of furans. All the
aforementioned reactions are not necessarily sequential but likely
to be very fast competing reactions resulting in different products.
The vibration for carbonyl compounds (∼1700 cm–1) at a higher temperature (from 250 °C) could arise from aldehydes,
ketones, and organic acids. Furthermore, the peak around 1590 cm–1 found at temperatures between 350 and 500 °C
(Figure 7b,c) could
be the consequence of condensation products that led to the formation
of compounds with C=O groups and aromatics. Scission of other
bonds, such as C–O–C and C–O, also occurred at
higher temperatures, suggesting fragmentation reactions, which produced
lower molecular weight compounds.29 Decarboxylation
was also evident at higher temperature according to the peaks at 2400
cm–1 that correspond to gas phase CO2 vibration.23 According to the observed
synchrotron FTIR spectral data, the breakdown of the glucose proceeded
via dehydration, ring opening, and isomerization that result in the
formation of furans. Dehydration reactions produce levoglucosan, and
lower molecular weight compounds are formed as a result of fragmentation
reactions. Decarboxylation liberates light gases during glucose pyrolysis. Figure 9, in particular,
presents the proposed mechanism for glucose pyrolysis based on the
results from this study, which also provides further insights into
cellulose pyrolysis. The effect of acid on these reactions when cellulose
is present with other biomass constituents, hemicellulose and lignin,
is described in the next section.

Figure 9 Proposed mechanism for pyrolysis of d-glucose based on
the synchrotron FTIR spectroscopic study corroborated using the literature.20 As cellulose is a polymer of glucose, this elucidates
the reactions that cellulose undergoes during pyrolysis after depolymerization.

2.4 In Situ
Functional Group Changes in Acid-Treated
Lignocellulose (Woody Biomass)
A lignocellulosic network
consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. It also contains
AAEM ions that are known to interact with cellulose and influence
the pyrolysis process.30 The effect of
different concentrations of acid treatment on the molecular structure
of biomass was studied using the synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy
technique and is shown in comparison to that of raw biomass in Figure 10. The spectra revealed
vibrations from the major constituents of biomass, including cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin. The O–H vibrations associated to
cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, are reflected by the peaks at
3350, 1335, and 1320 cm–1. The peaks at 2900, 1450,
and 1370 cm–1 represent the C–H stretches.
The C=O stretches between 1730 and 1590 cm–1 were originated from both holocellulose and lignin. The skeletal
vibration of aromatic rings produced peaks at 1590, 1560, 1540, and
1505 cm–1. The C–O–C stretching modes,
on the other hand, resulted in the peak at 1160 cm–1, while the C–O stretches yielded peaks at 1060 and 1030 cm–1. The peaks at 1100 and 900 cm–1, in particular, are indicative of ring stretches of the glucose
unit. These ring stretches likely arose from cellulose and hemicellulose
structures. Table 3 outlines the assignment of peaks observed in the spectra of biomass.

It was found that pre-treatment
of biomass with a concentration
of up to 1 M did not have any effect on the functional groups. However,
at ≥2 M concentration of acid, the peaks at 1730 and 1590–1500
cm–1 started to diminish. These vibrations originate
mainly from hemicellulose and lignin. Treatment of biomass with 2
M and higher acid concentration was observed to disrupt the lignocellulosic
network by dissolving hemicellulose and lignin. In fact, treatment
of biomass with acid is known to remove hemicellulose and lignin.31Figure 11a–e shows the effect of acid pre-treatment on the thermal
breakdown profile of biomass. Changes in spectral features observed
for raw biomass during thermal breakdown are presented in Supporting Information Figure S4. Similar changes
are reported and discussed in detail elsewhere in the literature.17

Figure 11 (a) Synchrotron FTIR spectra observed during thermal breakdown
of biomass treated with 0.05 M hydrochloric acid. (b) Synchrotron
FTIR spectra observed during thermal breakdown of biomass treated
with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. (c) Synchrotron FTIR spectra observed
during thermal breakdown of biomass treated with 0.5 M hydrochloric
acid. (d) Synchrotron FTIR spectra for thermal breakdown of biomass
treated with 1 M acid. (e) Synchrotron FTIR spectra for thermal breakdown
of biomass treated with 2 M acid.

Lower concentration of acid (up to 0.1 M) was observed to
stabilize
certain functional groups of biomass up to 500 °C. The O–H
(∼3400 cm–1) and C–H (∼2900
cm–1) functional groups in the raw biomass substantially
diminished at a temperature higher than 400 °C (see Supporting Information Figure S4) but were observed
after 400 °C in the acid-treated biomass at 0.05 and 0.1 M acid
concentration (Figure 11a,b). The stabilization of C–O vibration (at 1060 and 1030
cm–1) was also observed. The evolution of CO2 was evident at temperatures above 400 °C for the biomass
treated with 0.05 and 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. A loss of C=O
vibrations above 400 °C was also observed. The treatment with
low concentration of acid favored the decarboxylation reaction. However,
the stabilization of other functional groups suggested that it delayed
the fragmentation and polycondensation reactions. No significant effect
on dehydration reactions was observed. The peak at 880 cm–1 (=C–H) indicated that dehydration reactions occurred
at higher temperatures, but the catalytic effect of acid on dehydration
was not observed. This could be due to the neutralization of acid
by ash and AAEMs in biomass.32 The AAEM
ions are known to have a positive effect on char formation during
biomass pyrolysis.30,33 The passivation of ash and metal
ions by the acid resulted in delay of fragmentation and polycondensation
reactions responsible for char formation.

Biomass treated with
0.5 M acid concentration exhibited minor differences
with rising temperature during thermal breakdown. The peaks associated
with O–H functional groups (at 3400 and 1320 cm–1) started to disappear after 350 °C (Figure 12). The higher concentration of acid could
not only passivate the ash and metal ions but also catalyze the dehydration
reaction. The diminishing intensity of C=O vibrations (1730–1650
cm–1) at a temperature higher than 350 °C indicated
the onset of decarboxylation reactions. The onset of the disappearance
of the peaks representing C–H vibrations (1460–1430
and 1370 cm–1) was found at temperatures lower than
350 °C. The effect was found to be very significant at higher
acid concentrations (>1 M). The biomass treated with higher concentration
of acid (>1 M) underwent depolymerization and dehydration reactions
very quickly. The majority of the functional group vibrations disappeared
from 400 °C (Figure 11e). The high acid concentration also accelerated the char-producing
polycondensation reaction as evidenced by the peaks at 1560 cm–1 (aromatic skeletal vibrations) and 1590 cm–1 (aromatic ring conjugated with C=O group). At 4 M acid concentration,
these bonds underwent scission and decarboxylation reactions, which
resulted in the loss of almost all the functional groups in biomass
at 400 °C (see Supporting Information Figure S5).

Figure 12 Changes in spectral features showing the early onset of
the pyrolysis
reaction in biomass treated with higher acid concentration (0.5 M).

Thus, low concentration of acid
treatment was found to passivate
the ash content and stabilize certain functional groups during the
thermal breakdown. On the other hand, higher concentration of acid
was observed to accelerate reactions, including scission and fragmentation.
Our synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy study suggested that the acid
treatment exhibited a catalytic effect during the thermal breakdown
and also accelerated the reactions required for the formation of platform
chemicals as well as the reactions that led to char formation. The
acceleration of the dehydration reaction in acid-treated biomass results
in higher yields of platform chemicals, such as levoglucosenone and
furans, which were obtained even at low temperatures in the previous
studies.7,9,34

3 Conclusions
In this study, synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy
was used to (i)
investigate the effect of acid treatment on the molecular structure
of cellulose and biomass and (ii) determine the changes in the functional
groups of glucose, acid-treated cellulose, and biomass samples during
thermochemical conversion. The results obtained from the synchrotron
FTIR spectroscopy study provided molecular evidence for the proposed
mechanism behind the conversion of biomass to platform chemicals like
levoglucosenone and furans.

Based on the observed synchrotron
FTIR spectral features, cellulose
did not undergo significant structural changes upon acid treatment,
confirming that all the functional groups of cellulose were intact
even for those treated with 4 M hydrochloric acid. However, the lignin
and hemicellulose components of the lignocellulose network were found
to be dissolved when the biomass was treated with hydrochloric acid
stronger than 2 M. This was supported by the disappearance of the
vibrations characteristic to hemicellulose and lignin typically presented
at ∼1740 cm–1 and within the 1590–1505
cm–1 spectral range.

Changes in spectral features
observed for glucose indicated specific
functional groups associated with various reactions that lead to the
formation of platform chemicals during thermal conversion of cellulose
and biomass. The thermal breakdown of glucose proceeded through several
parallel reactions. The dehydration and isomerization reactions were
observed at 150 °C through the change of the bandshape of the
OH peak at 3400 cm–1 and the appearance of the peaks
at 1460 and 1270 cm–1. The major changes of the
functional group of glucose occurred at 200 °C. The presence
of the C=O vibration observed at 200 °C suggested the
occurrence of ring opening and tautomerization reactions. Dehydration
followed by isomerization leads to furfural formation, whereas dehydration
via levoglucosan results in the formation of other anyhydrosugars
such as levoglucosenone. On the other hand, fragmentation reactions,
which were observed at higher temperatures, yield low molecular weight
organic compounds.

In addition, acid treatment of cellulose
was found to accelerate
the dehydration reactions and the carbonyl peaks were observed at
300 °C. This explains the higher yields of levoglucosenone in
acid-treated cellulose at lower temperatures. In biomass, the treatment
of low acid concentration neutralized the charring effect of AAEMs,
while the treatment of high acid concentration passivated AAEMs and
catalyzed the dehydration reaction.

The samples selected for
this study were biomass (Pinus radiata), cellulose (catalogue no. 11365, Avicel PH 101, Sigma-Aldrich),
and d-glucose (catalogue no. G8270, Sigma-Aldrich). Fructose
(catalogue no. F0127, Sigma-Aldrich) was also used in the study to
obtain a better understanding of changes of the functional group and
isomerization of glucose during pyrolysis. The biomass was milled
to a size fraction of 45–63 μm and subsequently air dried.
The proximate analysis of biomass is presented in Table 4. Biomass and cellulose were
also treated with a range of different concentrations of hydrochloric
acid (catalogue no. RP1106, RCI Labscan).

Biomass was pre-treated with 0.05–4 M of aqueous
HCl. To
that end, 0.5 g of biomass was suspended in 50 mL of aqueous HCl at
different concentrations. Biomass was stirred for 20 h and subsequently
centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and
the pelleted biomass was dried at 60 °C for 48 h followed by
final drying at 105 °C for 24 h.

Cellulose was also treated
with 0.05–4 M of aqueous HCl.
To obtain pre-treated cellulose, it was first stirred in desired concentration
of aqueous HCl for 5 h. After stirring, the suspension was centrifuged
at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and the cellulose
pellet was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and then at 105 °C for
24 h.

4.2 Synchrotron-Based Infra-Red Spectroscopy
The changes in functional groups in raw biomass, cellulose, glucose,
fructose, pre-treated biomass, and cellulose samples were investigated
using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy at the infrared microspectroscopy
(IRM) beamline, Australian Synchrotron (Victoria, Australia). The
unique advantages of the synchrotron FTIR technique are due to the
superior characteristics of high photon flux and diffraction-limited
spatial resolution, allowing spatially resolved chemical “mapping”
measurement of materials to be performed at a lateral resolution between
3 and 10 μm (depending on wavelength). Using the synchrotron
FTIR microspectroscopy technique, good quality spectra at a high signal-to-noise
ratio can be obtained from very fine particles, which are typically
produced as a result of thermal breakdown.

The synchrotron FTIR
measurement was performed in the transmission mode using a Bruker
Vertex 80v spectrometer coupled with a Hyperion 2000 FTIR microscope
and a liquid nitrogen-cooled narrow-band mercury cadmium telluride
detector. The synchrotron IR beam was focused to a spot size of ∼16
μm using a 15× objective (NA = 0.4) suitable for the setup
of the temperature-controlled Linkam stage. The acquisition parameters
were 4 cm–1 spectral resolution and 128 co-added
scans. Blackman-Harris 3-term apodization, power-spectrum phase correction,
and zero-filling factor of 2 were set as default acquisition parameters
using OPUS 7.2 software suite (Bruker). At each temperature, background
spectra were acquired from sample-free areas inside the barium fluoride
(BaF2) window used as an IR transparent substrate, once
before conducting sample measurement.

4.3 Temperature-Controlled
Linkam Stage
The in situ investigation of changes in functional
groups during
thermal breakdown of the sample was facilitated using a temperature-controlled
Linkam stage (FTIR600 Infra Red stage, Linkam Scientific Instruments,
Tadworth, UK). The sample stage offered heating rates of up to 150
°C/min and linear cooling rates of 0.01–100 °C/min.
In this study, the stage was heated up to 550 °C and was cooled
down using liquid nitrogen to prepare it for the next run cycle. The
sample was placed on the sample stage located at the centre of its
gas tight chamber maintained at atmospheric pressure. The chamber
was nitrogen purged at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. Barium fluoride (BaF2) windows were used with the Linkam stage as they provide
a broad IR transmission range (4000–800 cm–1) and can withstand high temperatures.

4.4 Data
Acquisition and Analysis
The
particles were squashed inside a compression cell to produce sufficiently
thin pieces of samples suitable for operation in the transmission
mode. The samples were placed and dispersed evenly on a BaF2 window. After that, the samples on the BaF2 window were
transferred to the Linkam stage. The particles, from which synchrotron
FTIR spectra were acquired, were carefully selected and were determined
by acquiring spectra at ambient temperature (30 °C). Thereafter,
the particles were heated at a rate of 150 °C/min (for biomass
and cellulose) and 10 °C/min (for glucose and fructose) from
30 to 100 °C and finally at 550 °C. The spectra were acquired
at 50 °C intervals.

The collected spectral data were processed
using OPUS 7.2 software (Bruker). Spectral processing consisted of
baseline correction using the rubber band method, followed by normalization
of spectra using the min–max method.35 The peak assignment was based on cited literature.
