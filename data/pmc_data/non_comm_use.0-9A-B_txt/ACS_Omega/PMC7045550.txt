Nanolithia-based materials are promising
lithium-ion battery cathodes
owing to their high capacity, low overpotential, and stable cyclic
performance. Their properties are highly dependent on the structure
and composition of the catalysts, which play a role in activating
the lithia to participate in the electrochemical redox reaction. However,
the use of electrolyte additives can be an efficient approach to improve
properties of the lithia-based cathodes. In this work, vinylethylene
carbonate (VEC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) were introduced
as electrolyte additives in cells containing lithia-based cathode
(lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite). The use
of additives enhanced the electrochemical performance of the lithia-based
cathodes, including the rate capability and cyclic performance. Especially,
their available capacity increased without modifying the cathodes.
Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed
that the additives form interface layers at the cathode surface, which
contain Li2CO3, more carbon reactants, and more
LiF than the interface layer formed with the pristine electrolyte.
The Li2CO3 and carbon reactants may improve
rate capability by facilitating Li+ transport, and LiF
may stabilize the Li2O2 (and/or LiO2) produced by the oxygen redox reaction with lithia. Therefore, the
additive-enhanced electrochemical performance of the cell is attributed
to the effects of the interface layer derived from additive decomposition
during cycling.

Introduction
In recent years, lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) have been used in
various devices, including smartphones, laptop computers, and electric
vehicles. As the applications of LIBs increase, the demand for advanced
LIBs with high energy densities increases as well. Developing high-capacity
cathodes is indispensable for realizing advanced LIBs with high energy
densities. Since the commercialization of LIBs with LiCoO2 as the cathode material, many transition-metal oxides, such as Li(Ni,
Co, Mn)O2 (NCM)1−3 and Li(Ni, Co, Al)O2 (NCA),4−7 have been suggested as advanced cathode materials with higher capacities.
The capacity of these transition-metal oxides is fundamentally based
on the cationic redox reaction of the transition-metal ions in the
oxides. These cathode materials have also been successfully commercialized
owing to their considerable capacities and stable electrochemical
performances. However, because the discharge capacity of these oxides
is determined by the amount of transition metal present, the weight
of the transition metals has prevented higher capacity results.

Recently, new cathode materials based on anionic redox reactions
have attracted much attention. They are expected to deliver a higher
capacity than that of commercial cathodes because the anionic redox
reaction is attributed to the oxidation and reduction of oxygen, which
has a lighter weight than transition metals. In practice, several
cathode materials, such as Li–Nb–Mn–O, Li–Mn–O,
and Li–Ru–M–O (M = Sn, Nb), have yielded capacities
that exceed 300 mAh·g–1.8−15 Although their capacity is based on both the cationic redox reaction
associated with transition metals and the anionic (oxygen) redox reaction,
the latter is more influential. However, these materials have exhibited
sluggish kinetics and rapid capacity fading during cycling.

Lithia (Li2O)-based materials are also promising cathode
materials based on the anionic redox reaction.16−21 In contrast to that of commonly used cathode materials, the capacity
of lithia-based cathodes is attributed primarily to the oxygen (anionic)
redox reaction between O2– (Li2O) and
Ox– (0.5 ≤ x < 2). They also have superior cyclic characteristics compared
to those of Li–M–O (M = Nb, Mn, Ru, Sn, etc.) cathodes.16−18 However, the electrochemically inactive lithia (Li2O)
must be combined with catalysts (sometimes called dopants) to activate
the anionic redox reaction. The catalysts also stabilize vulnerable
reaction products, such as Li2O2 and/or LiO2.1616 Therefore, selecting both a suitable catalyst and the specific lithia/catalyst
combination has been a focus of research on lithia-based cathodes.

As a new approach, the introduction of an electrolyte additive
has recently been suggested as a method of enhancing the electrochemical
performance of lithia-based cathodes without changing the type of
catalyst or the structure of the lithia-catalyst nanocomposites.22 However, little research has been conducted
on these additives thus far, and the cause of the additive effect
is not yet known. In this study, the effect of electrolyte additives
on the electrochemical properties of a lithia-based cathode was characterized
in detail. Specifically, we attempted to clarify the cause of the
additive effect by analyzing the interface layer derived from the
additives. A lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite
was used as a lithia-based cathode owing to its high capacity and
stable cyclic performance.23 Vinylethylene
carbonate (VEC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) were used as electrolyte
additives because they are generally applied to enhance the electrochemical
performance of the Li-ion cells.24−30 Including additives was expected to increase the available capacity
of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite due
to the formation of an interface layer during cycling. The interface
layer formed on the nanocomposite was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate the effect of the additives.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
voltage curve of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite
for three cycles measured at a current density of 10 mA·g–1. Three types of electrolytes, pristine (ethylene
carbonate/dimethyl carbonate, EC/DMC = 1:1), FEC-added, and VEC-added
electrolytes, were used, and the capacity was limited to 600 and 700
mAh·g–1 to determine the limit of available
capacity of the samples. Lithia-based cathodes generate oxygen gas
when they are overcharged beyond the capacity limit at which oxygen
maintains the condensed phase, a result of which it is necessary to
determine the available capacity that can be stably used with sufficient
cyclic performance. The capacity was calculated based on the lithia
weight in the electrode. As shown in Figure 1a, when the capacity was limited to 600 mAh·g–1 and the pristine electrolyte was used, the voltage
curves retained their capacity for three cycles. However, the overpotential
observed in the voltage curve gradually increased during cycling.
When the limited capacity was increased to 700 mAh·g–1 (Figure 1b), the
discharge capacity was not maintained and began to decrease in the
third cycle. This indicates that 700 mAh·g–1 exceeded the available capacity of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite in these conditions.

Figure 1 Voltage curves of lithia/(Ir,
Li2IrO3) nanocomposites
at a current density of 10 mA·g–1 measured
in (a) pristine electrolyte with a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1, (b) pristine electrolyte with a limited capacity
of 700 mAh·g–1, (c) FEC-added electrolyte with
a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1, (d) FEC-added
electrolyte with a limited capacity of 700 mAh·g–1, (e) VEC-added electrolyte with a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1, and (f) VEC-added electrolyte with a limited capacity
of 700 mAh·g–1.

Notably, the shape of the voltage curves of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite was changed significantly by
the additives. When the FEC-added electrolyte was used, the voltage
curve of the nanocomposite at a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1 was more stable for three cycles (Figure 1c) compared with that measured
using the pristine electrolyte (Figure 1a). The change in the voltage profiles during cycling
was relatively small, and the difference between the charge and discharge
voltage range was decreased using FEC as the electrolyte additive,
which indicates that the overpotential of the cells was reduced. However,
when the limited capacity was increased to 700 mAh·g–1, the voltage profile was somewhat changed during the three cycles
and the overpotential increased compared to that measured with a limited
capacity of 600 mAh·g–1 (Figure 1d).

As shown in Figure 1e,f, the voltage curve of the nanocomposite
measured using the VEC-added
electrolyte also showed a lower overpotential than that measured using
the pristine electrolyte. In particular, when the capacity was limited
to 700 mAh·g–1, the VEC-added electrolyte considerably
reduced the overpotential of the cell compared to the over-potentials
measured using the FEC-added and the pristine electrolytes. These
results indicate that the use of additives successfully increased
the available capacity of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite and reduced the overpotential of the cells. Furthermore,
VEC seems to be more efficient in obtaining these effects than FEC.

Figure 2 compares
the initial voltage profiles of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite measured at current densities of 10, 50, 100,
and 200 mA·g–1 using each of the three electrolytes
at a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1. When
the pristine electrolyte was used, the cells showed rapid capacity
reduction as the current density increased (Figure 2a). In contrast, the cells maintained their
capacity (600 mAh·g–1), even at high current
densities (100 and 200 mA·g–1), when the FEC-
and VEC-added electrolytes were used, as shown in Figure 2b,c. Moreover, the increase
in overpotential at high current densities (100 and 200 mA·g–1) was reduced by the use of additives. These results
demonstrate that including FEC and VEC additives in the electrolyte
is an effective method for enhancing the rate capability of the lithia/(Ir,
Li2IrO3) nanocomposite as well as increasing
the capacity of the cell. Adding VEC to the electrolyte seems to be
more efficient than adding FEC in reducing the overpotential and improving
the rate capability of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite.

Figure 2 Voltage profiles of lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3)
nanocomposites at current densities of 10, 50, 100, and 200 mA·g–1 with a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1, obtained using (a) pristine electrolyte, (b) FEC-added electrolyte,
and (c) VEC-added electrolyte.

The cyclic performance of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite was measured using each of the three electrolytes,
with a current density of 100 mA·g–1 and a
limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1. As shown in Figure 3a, the capacity of
the cell was reduced after a few cycles with a limited capacity of
600 mAh·g–1 when using the pristine electrolyte.
This indicates that the cell was overcharged beyond the available
capacity of the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite
in these conditions. In general, it is assumed that the lithia (Li2O, O2–) can be oxidized to peroxide (Li2O2, O1–) during charging while
retaining the condensed oxygen phase.17−20 Moreover, it has also been suggested
that the oxygen in the lithia could be oxidized to LiO2 (O0.5–) during charging without oxygen evolution,16 which would lead to an increase in the theoretical
capacity of lithia from 897 to 1341 mAh·g–1. Considering this, the limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1 adopted in this work is lower than the theoretical capacity of the
lithia. However, the electrochemical activation of lithia is difficult
and a suitable catalyst is required to activate the oxygen redox reaction
in the lithia. In this study, the Li2IrO3 and
Ir (generated from the decomposition of Li2IrO3)23 acted as catalysts. Because the milling
process used during the preparation of the cathode material results
in imperfect contact between the lithia and the catalysts, some portions
of lithia may not be electrochemically activated, which results in
the capacity being lower than the theoretical capacity. Therefore,
600 mAh·g–1 can be inferred to be beyond the
achievable capacity while maintaining the condensed phase.

Figure 3 Cyclic performance
of lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposites at a
current density of 100 mA·g–1 with a limited
capacity of 600 mAh·g–1, measured
in (a) pristine electrolyte, (b) FEC-added electrolyte, and (c) VEC-added
electrolyte.

However, the available capacity
was increased using FEC and VEC
as electrolyte additives without altering the structure or composition
of the cathode materials. As shown in Figure 3b, when the FEC was added to the electrolyte,
the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite maintained
the capacity (600 mAh·g–1) during 100 cycles.
Although the cell with the VEC-added electrolyte showed slight instability
after 83 cycles (Figure 3c), the cyclic performance was clearly improved by the addition of
both FEC and VEC to the electrolyte. Considering that the contact
between lithia and catalysts in the cathode materials is not modified
due to the effect of electrolyte additives, the increase in capacity
achieved using electrolyte additives cannot be easily explained by
changes in the cathodes themselves.

The reaction products of
the oxygen redox reaction in lithia-based
cathodes, such as Li2O2 and/or LiO2, are difficult to retain within the structure of the condensed phase
because they are unstable and highly reactive. The stabilization of
these reaction products in the lithia-based cathode is one of the
purposes of using catalysts; however, the unstable reaction products
may be able to react with other materials, such as the electrolyte,
despite the inclusion of catalysts in the cathode material. In particular,
Li2O2 and LiO2 are expected to be
able to easily release electrons into the electrolyte and release
gaseous oxygen in the fully charged state. Therefore, the ability
to suppress these undesirable Li2O2 and LiO2 reactions is one of the major factors in determining the
available capacity of the lithia-based cathodes. The authors believe
that the electrolyte additives may assist in the stabilization of
the oxygen redox reaction products during cycling. In previous studies,
FEC and VEC have been applied to the formation of a solid–electrolyte
interphase (SEI) layer in the cell to protect the electrode from the
electrolyte and they have been used to form a protective film on the
anode surface.24−30 However, FEC and VEC can also form an interface layer on the cathode
surface, which may help to protect Li2O2 and
LiO2 from undesirable reactions with the electrolyte, resulting
in an increase in the capacity of lithia-based cathodes.

Figure 4 shows the
Nyquist plots of the cells containing the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite, measured before the electrochemical
test, after the first cycle, and after the 100th cycle (with a limited
capacity of 600 mAh·g–1) using each of the
three electrolytes. The semicircle in the Nyquist plots indicates
the impedance value of the cells, which is related to the charge-transfer
resistance and the SEI layer. The size of the semicircle in the Nyquist
plots obtained before the electrochemical test was reduced by including
the FEC and VEC electrolyte additives, which indicates that the additives
effectively reduced the impedance value of the cell (Figure 4a). The addition of VEC showed
this effect more clearly than the addition of FEC. The semicircle
size measured using the pristine electrolyte did not change distinctly
after the first cycle; however, the size of the semicircles decreased
slightly after the first cycle when the electrolyte additives were
used. The relatively low impedance of the cells with electrolyte additives
can explain the superior rate capability and low overpotential observed
in Figures 1 and 2. This also shows that the use of FEC and VEC facilitates
the charge transfer and decreases the resistance related to the SEI
layer. Furthermore, VEC is more effective than FEC in reducing the
impedance of the cells. As shown in Figure 4c, the impedance of all cells was increased
after the 100th cycle. Particularly, the cell using the pristine electrolyte
showed a significantly increased impedance value, while the cells
using electrolyte additives showed relatively less increased impedance
value.

nanocomposites obtained using pristine, FEC-added, and VEC-added electrolytes

(c) after the 100th cycle.

To elucidate the effect of the FEC and VEC electrolyte additives
on the electrochemical performance of the lithia-based cathodes, the
surface layer of the cathode was analyzed using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and XPS. Figure 5 shows the SEM images of the electrode surfaces before
the electrochemical test and after 100 cycles using each of the three
electrolytes and a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1. The surface of the electrodes is composed of a cathode (lithia/(Ir,
Li2IrO3) nanocomposite), conductive carbon,
and a binder (poly(vinylidene difluoride), PVDF). In the SEM image
of the cathode obtained before the electrochemical test, protruding
powder particles are clearly observed (Figure 5a), although it is difficult to distinguish
individual components clearly. However, after cycling, the powder
particles appear to be covered with a film layer (Figure 5b–d), which may be formed
during cycling.

test,
(b) after 100 cycles using the pristine electrolyte, (c) after 100
cycles using the FEC-added electrolyte, and (d) after 100 cycles using
the VEC-added electrolyte.

For a more detailed analysis, the surface of the electrodes was
analyzed by XPS after 100 cycles using each of the three electrolytes
and a limited capacity of 600 mAh·g–1. Figure 6a shows the C 1s
spectrum of the cathode after 100 cycles using the pristine electrolyte.
The peak at approximately 284.6 eV was assigned to the C–C
bond and related to the conductive carbon in the electrode.31,32 The peaks observed at approximately 291.0 and 285.4 eV are attributed
to the CF2 and C–H environments of the binder (PVDF),
respectively. The peaks at about 286.5 and 287.6 eV correspond to
C–O–C and CO2 due to carbon reactants present
on the surface, respectively, which may be derived from the decomposition
of the carbonate electrolyte during cycling.31,32 In the F 1s spectrum (Figure 6b), the peak observed at approximately 688.1 eV was attributed
to C–F2 in the PVDF binder in the electrode. The
other peaks at approximately 685.5 and 687 eV arise from LiF and LixPOyFz, respectively, which are generated from the decomposition
of the LiPF6 salt-containing electrolyte during cycling.31,32 The materials derived from the electrolyte during cycling may form
the film layer on the surface of the electrode. As shown in Figure 6c,d, the XPS spectrum
of the electrode after cycling in the FEC-added electrolyte was somewhat
different compared with the XPS spectrum obtained using the pristine
electrolyte. In the C 1s spectrum (Figure 6c), the peaks at approximately 289.6 and
288.2 eV were attributed to Li2CO3 and the polar
carbonate (R-CO3),26 respectively, which were newly generated, and the intensity
of the peak corresponding to C–O–C (286.5 eV) on the
surface increased considerably. These species are thought to be derived
from the decomposition of the FEC during cycling.26 The Li2CO3 and carbon reactants have
been reported to facilitate Li+ transport, which would
enhance the rate capability of the cells using the FEC-added electrolyte,26 as shown in Figure 2. In the F 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled
in the FEC-added electrolyte (Figure 6d), the peaks were identified as belonging to C–F2, LiF, and LixPOyFz, as for the spectrum of the
electrode cycled in the pristine electrolyte. However, the relative
intensity of the LiF peak increased, while the intensity of the LixPOyFz peak decreased due to the addition of FEC to the
electrolyte. The LiF is a stable layer that passivates the electrode
surface and suppresses electron leakage from the cathode to the electrolyte.24 The large proportion of LiF in the interface
film layer may play an important role in preventing undesirable reactions
between the electrolyte and reactive Li2O2 (and/or
LiO2) species formed by the oxygen redox reaction in the
lithia-based cathode.

Figure 6 Combined XPS spectra of the electrodes after the 100th
cycle: (a)
C 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in the pristine electrolyte,
(b) F 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in the pristine electrolyte,
(c) C 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in the FEC-added electrolyte,
(d) F 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in the FEC-added electrolyte,
(e) C 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in the VEC-added electrolyte,
and (f) F 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in the VEC-added electrolyte.

In the C 1s spectrum of the electrode cycled in
the VEC-added electrolyte
(Figure 6e), the intensity
of the peaks related to Li2CO3 and carbon reactants
(C–O–C, C–H) was significantly larger compared
to that of other C 1s spectra (Figure 6a,c). This suggests that using VEC as the electrolyte
additive results in the formation of a higher quantity of the carbon
species (including Li2CO3) during cycling compared
with that using FEC as the electrolyte additive or using the pristine
electrolyte. Considering that Li2CO3 and carbon
reactants can enhance the charge transfer of the lithia-based cathode,
it is consistent with the fact that the cell using the VEC-added electrolyte
showed superior rate capability compared to that of the cells using
either the FEC-added electrolyte or the pristine electrolyte. In the
F 1s spectrum (Figure 6f), the peak corresponding to LiF is also larger than the peak corresponding
to LixPOyFz. The LiF layer can suppress undesirable reactions
between the electrolyte and Li2O2 (and/or LiO2). However, the relative intensity of the LiF/LixPOyFz was somewhat lower than that in the spectra of the cells
using the FEC-added electrolyte. It is inferred that the LiF layer
is formed more easily from the decomposition of FEC than that of VEC
because FEC contains fluorine, while VEC does not.

Based on
the XPS results, the effect of the electrolyte additives
is concluded to arise from the interface layer formed as the additives
decompose during cycling. The Li2CO3 and carbon
reactants in the interface layer improve the rate capability by facilitating
charge transfer. This improvement in the high-rate characteristics
of the cell allows more lithia to react with lithium ions and electrons
under constant current density conditions and can delay the oxygen
evolution caused by local overcharge at the interface. These effects
can increase the available capacity of the lithia-based cathode, as
shown in Figure 1.
The addition of VEC to the electrolyte solution seems to be more effective
than the addition of FEC as VEC apparently forms more of these reactants
during cycling. The large portion of LiF in the interface layer may
stabilize the reactive Li2O2 and LiO2 during cycling, which also helps to increase the available capacity
and improve the cyclic performance of the lithia-based cathode. For
the formation of the LiF layer, FEC seems to be a more effective electrode
additive than VEC, which may explain the fact that the cells using
FEC have superior cyclic performance compared to that of the cells
using VEC, as shown in Figure 3. The LiF layer can act as an obstacle to the movement of
Li ions and electrons during cycling, but in the cycling process,
the effect of stabilizing the lithia-based cathode by the formation
of a LiF layer will outweigh the drawbacks of the LiF layer because
the oxygen reduction reaction products, such as Li2O2 and/or LiO2, are unstable. Figure 7 illustrates the effect of additives in the
electrolyte on the lithia-based cathode.

the effect of electrolyte additives

Conclusions
In this study, the effect
of FEC and VEC electrolyte additives
on the electrochemical performance of a lithia-based cathode (lithia/(Ir,
Li2IrO3) nanocomposites) was investigated. Cells
using electrolyte additives exhibited increased available capacity,
enhanced rate capability, and lower impedance values than those of
the cells using the pristine electrolyte. The interface layer, formed
due to the decomposition of the electrolyte additives, containing
Li2CO3 and carbon reactants on the cathode surface
was determined using XPS. The Li2CO3 and carbon
reactants facilitate Li+ transport, which enhances the
rate capability and reduces the impedance value of the lithia-based
cathodes. The use of VEC as the electrolyte additive was superior
in obtaining this effect compared to the use of FEC because VEC generated
more Li2CO3 and carbon reactants than FEC. The
use of additives also increased the ratio of LiF in the interface
layer, which is beneficial to stabilizing the reactive Li2O2 (and/or LiO2) species formed from the oxygen
redox reaction in the lithia-based cathodes. Using FEC formed more
LiF than that using VEC, which may explain the better cyclic performance
of the cells using the FEC-added electrolyte compared to that of the
cells using the VEC-added electrolyte. The increased available capacity
of the lithia-based cathode achieved by the use of electrolyte additives
is attributed to the synergistic effect of stabilizing Li2O2 (and/or LiO2) and improving the rate capability.
It is our hope that this work can contribute to the understanding
of the effect of electrolyte additives on the performance of the lithia-based
cathode.

Methods
To fabricate the Li2IrO3 catalyst, pellets
composed of a 1:1.2 (wt %) ratio of IrO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99%)
and Li2CO3 (Aldrich, 99.99%) were prepared.
The pellets were calcined at 950 °C for 10 h, further heat-treated
at 1000 °C for 86 h under an O2 atmosphere, and ground
into a powder. The ramping rate was 100 °C h–1 (furnace cooling). The prepared Li2IrO3 powder
was used as the catalyst source for the lithia-based nanocomposite.
The lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite was fabricated
by high milling synthesis.23 The obtained
Li2IrO3 powder was dispersed in butanol (Aldrich,
anhydrous, 99.8%) with lithia powder (Li2O, Alfa Aesar,
99.5%). The mole ratio of the Li2O (lithia)/Li2IrO3 was 4.5:1. The dried product was mixed using a planetary
mono mill (Pulverisette 6, FRITSCH) at 600 rpm for 150 h (resting
for 30 min after milling for 1 h). Some Li2IrO3 decomposed to Ir to facilitate the lithia/(Ir, Li2IrO3) nanocomposite formation during the milling process. To prepare
the cathode material for use in electrochemical cells, the nanocomposite
was mixed with 30 wt % carbon nanotubes and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene
fluoride) binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),
as the solvent, by ball milling for 90 min. Then, the mixture was
cast onto aluminum foil and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24
h. Coin cells (2032-type) were used for the electrochemical tests
with Li metal as the anode and polypropylene as the separator. The
electrolyte solution was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture
of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) of a volume
ratio of 1:1. To investigate the effect of additives, FEC and VEC
were added separately to the electrolyte at a concentration of 5 vol
%. The cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox. Charge–discharge
tests between 1.5 and 4.35 V were conducted at various current densities
(10, 50, 100, and 200 mA·g–1) using a WonATech
voltammetry system.

Impedance measurements of cells before the
electrochemical test,
as well as after the first and the 100th cycle, were performed using
an electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, VersaSTAT 3) by applying an
AC voltage with an amplitude of 5 mV over a frequency range of 0.1
Hz to 100 kHz. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, AP tech TECNAI G2
F30 S-Twin) was employed to observe the surface layer of the cathode
electrode after cycling. The C 1s and F 1s chemical binding energies
of the samples were analyzed by XPS (Thermo Scientific K-α).
To prepare the used electrodes for XPS analysis, they were washed
several times with DMC and dried under vacuum for 24 h. The obtained
spectra were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
