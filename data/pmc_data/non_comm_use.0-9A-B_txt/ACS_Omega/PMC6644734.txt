Hierarchical
mesoporous TiO2 was synthesized via a solvothermal
technique. The sonochemical method was adopted to decorate plasmonic
nanoparticles (NPs) (Ag, Au) on the pores of mesoporous TiO2. The crystallinity, structure, and morphology were determined to
understand the physicochemical nature of the nanocomposites. The catalytic
efficiency of the plasmonic nanocatalysts was tested for the azo dyes
(congo red, methyl orange, acid orange 10, and remazol red) under
solar and visible light irradiations. The generation of hydroxyl radicals
was also studied using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule. An attempt
was made to understand the influence of size, work function and Fermi
level of the metal NPs toward the efficiency of the photocatalyst.
The efficiency of the nanocomposites was found to be in the order
of P25 < mesoporous TiO2 < mesoporous Ag–TiO2 < mesoporous Au–TiO2 nanospheres under
both direct solar light and visible light irradiation. The results
indicated that the adsorption of dye, anatase phase, and surface plasmon
resonance of NPs favored the effective degradation of dyes in aqueous
solution. Further, the efficiency of the catalyst was also tested
for xanthene (rose bengal), rhodamine (rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G),
and thiazine (methylene blue) dyes. Both TiO2 and NPs (Ag
& Au) possess a huge potential as an eco-friendly photocatalyst
for wastewater treatment.

Introduction
The removal of toxic
pollutants from industrial effluents is a
great concern to environment and ecosystem.1 The synthetic origin and aromatic nature of azo dyes make them stable,
nonbiodegradable, and potential carcinogenic agents. Discharge of
these dyes even in microquantities leads to acute problems to aquatic
life thereby causing major health hazards to humans via the food chain.2 Semiconductor-based photocatalytic materials
have attracted immense attention for cleaning up the textile effluents
as wastewater treatment is cost-effective and eco-friendly.3 Several semiconductor materials are tested under
ideal conditions to diminish the toxicity of industrial effluents,
of which TiO2 has been found to be a most active photocatalyst
because of its band gap (3.2 eV), redox potential, photocatalytic
stability, nontoxicity, and chemical and biological inertness.3d−3f,4 Recently, size- and shape-controlled
TiO2 nanostructures show better catalytic efficiency compared
with their bulk counterparts.3c,5 In addition, in the
nanoscale regime, the probability of photogenerated electron–hole
pair recombination will drastically reduce owing to their fast arrival
at the surface of the reaction sites.5b,5d,6 Because the surface of the photocatalyst plays a
vital role in the case of photocatalytic reaction; these TiO2 nanostructures made of small nanoparticles (NPs) arranged in a hierarchical
nanostructured fashion possess a mesoporous structure in nature, thus
higher surface area is highly sought.5b−5d,6,7 However, wide band gap energy
forbidden their photo absorptivity of visible light in our solar spectrum
and moreover rapid recombination of the photo excitons limits their
photocatalytic efficiency.3b,3d,4a Hence, to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, the evolution of hybrid nanostructures made up of noble metal NPs
decorated TiO2 is a promising choice.8 The noble metal NPs present on the surface of TiO2 acts as the electron scavenging centers to increase the electron–hole
pair separation thereby paving way for visible light absorption through
their surface plasmon resonance (SPR), consequently enhancing the
photocatalytic efficiency toward the degradation of the textile effluent.3a,4a,8a,8d−8h,9

Noble-metal NPs, especially,
Ag and Au show strong and broad SPR
absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and the frequency
of the SPR band directly proportional to their size and shape.3a,3d,4a,8−10 Further, the size of the metal NPs plays a major
role in the photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants.
When the metal NP is less than 5 nm, the Fermi level energy of TiO2 shifts to the more negative direction and the resultant potential
difference between the conduction band of TiO2 and the
Fermi level of the metal NPs is reduced.9,11 As a result,
number of excitons accumulates on the surface of the deposited metal
NPs; hence, the apparent Fermi level of metal NPs will come close
to the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2.4a,9,11a−11c,11e,11f As a result, the Fermi level equilibrium takes place quickly and
rapid electron transfer from TiO2 to metal NPs occurs for
improved photo-oxidation reaction by the photoexcited hole. In addition,
the surface modification of TiO2 with size- and shape-controlled
Au and/or Ag NPs will make them an efficient visible-light-driven
plasmonic photocatalyst.4a,9,11a−11c,11e,11f Recently, the photocatalytic activity of size- and
shape-depended noble-metal NPs deposited on the surface of TiO2 NPs toward the energy and environmental applications, such
as photocatalytic production of hydrogen,11c,11g CO oxidation,11d,11f photocatalytic degradation of
salicylic acid,11a and rhodamine B (Rh
B),11e is reported. However, it is still
a challenge to produce a size-controlled distribution of Au and/or
Ag NPs (ranges from 2 to 5 nm) on the TiO2 surface.11e Conventional photoreduction, thermal decomposition,
and hydrothermal methods often produce low crystalline, aggregated,
and large size with uneven distribution of Au and/or Ag NPs.8a,12 Recently, uniformly dispersed 2–5 nm sized Au NPs were successfully
synthesized through the sonochemical method with effects generated
by acoustic cavitation.13 In this context,
it is essential to develop new plasmonic photocatalysts with the high
specific surface area, low charge recombination, and good stability
with superior photocatalytic activity. In this work, an architectural
design was implemented to study the possible effects of the small
size of Au and Ag NPs decorated on mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres
(NSPs). The photocatalytic performance was studied toward the degradations
of azo dyes; congo red (CR), methyl orange (MO), remazol red (RR),
and acid orange 10 (AO10) in water under the illumination of direct
solar light. Efforts were made to quantify the HO• radical generation during the photocatalytic degradation. The photocatalytic
efficiency was also tested for other classes of dyes such as xanthene
[rose bengal (RB)], rhodamine [Rh B, rhodamine 6G (Rh 6G)], and thiazine
[methylene blue (MB)] dyes.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Photocatalysts
Ultrasonic wave
with high frequency plays a vital role in the synthesis of ultrasmall
noble-metal NPs decorated mesoporous TiO2. The ultrasonic
waves interact with the water molecules to generate the acoustic cavitation.13b,13c Because acoustic cavitation makes high temperature (∼5000
K) and pressure (∼500 atm) during the bubble collapse, it helps
the reduction of Au3+ and Ag+ to ultrasmall
Au0 and Ag0 NPs with the assistance of NaBH4 to deposit over the surface of mesoporous TiO2.13a,13b,14 Moreover,
during sonication, both the mesoporous TiO2 network and
metal NPs underwent configuration changes in association with crystallization
and particle coarsening.14 The two phases
were confined with each other, leading to the formation of well-dispersed
ultra-small metal NPs within the titania network, with spherical morphology
and narrow pore size distribution, preserving the mesoporous structure.14 The size and shape of the ultrasmall metal (Au
and Ag) NPs were identified through their SPR. In general, SPR is
a key factor to identify the shape, size, and dielectric constants
of both the metal NPs and the surrounding material.10c,11a,13a,13b,14Figure 1A shows the characteristic SPR bands maxima
at 510 and 408 nm for Au and Ag NPs, respectively.9,11a,11d,11e This is the
primary confirmation for the presence of ultrasmall Au and Ag NPs
deposited over the mesoporous TiO2. Further, the band gap
of the photocatalyst was calculated using the Tauc plot (Figure 1A inset). The band
gap of metal-decorated mesoporous TiO2 (Eg Au–TiO2 = 2.99 eV, Eg Ag–TiO2 = 3.05 eV) is found to
be lower than the band gap of the bare TiO2 (Eg TiO2 = 3.16 eV). From the results, it
is henceforth concluded that the deposition of transitional noble-metal
NPs within the pores of mesoporous TiO2 could shift its
optical absorption edge from UV into the visible light range.4a,8g,11a,11e,14 Thus, ultrasmall metal (Au and
Ag) NP-decorated mesoporous TiO2 are expected to show efficient
visible light-driven plasmonic photocatalytic activity toward the
degradation of textile effluents. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was
analyzed to investigate the crystalline size and crystalline phase
of metal NPs decorated mesoporous TiO2. The XRD patterns
(Figure 1B) reveal
that mesoporous TiO2 made of crystalline structure of anatase
phase and their significant diffraction peaks appear at 2θ =
25.3°, 37.9°, 48.0°, 53.8°, 54.9°, and 62.8°corresponding
to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (112) diffraction reflections
(JCPDS file no. 211272), respectively.8e,8f,15 The average grain size of the as-synthesized mesoporous
TiO2 is calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula
with respect to the full width at half-maximum of the primary beam.
Evaluating the most intense peak at 2θ = 25.3° yields the
average grain size of the TiO2 to be about 5–6 nm.
The XRD pattern of noble-metal-decorated mesoporous TiO2 shows additional peaks assigned to corresponding metal NPs. Ag NPs
exhibit four prominent peaks at 2θ values of about 38.2°,
44.4°, 64.5° and 77.5°, representing the (111), (200),
(220), and (311) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of
Ag (JCPDS file no 04-0783).8f Au NPs show
four prominent peaks at 2θ values of about 38.6°, 45.7°,
59.5° and 77.6°, representing the (111), (200), (220), and
(311) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of Au (JCPDS file
no. 04-0784).8e,11a,14,15 Further, the closer look of anatase phase
at the maximum intensity (101) peak in case of metal decorated mesoporous
TiO2 exhibit qualitatively identical diffraction features
with high diffraction intensity. Raman spectroscopy is employed to
investigate the crystalline structure of mesoporous TiO2 and is depicted in Figure 1C. The anatase phase is characterized by the tetragonal space
group (I41/amd) and six
allowed Raman transitions (1A1g, 2B1g, and 3Eg) according to the factor group analysis. Five Raman-active
modes Eg (140 cm–1), Eg (206
cm–1), B1g (395 cm–1), A1g (515 cm–1), and Eg (635 cm–1) are observed for anatase in all photocatalysts.
These five peaks are attributed to the υ1 + υ2 vibrations of A1g + B1g, υ3 vibration of B1g and υ4, υ5, υ6 vibrations of Eg. The position
and intensity of these Raman active modes are matched well with the
anatase phase of nanocrystalline TiO2.16 These results clearly indicate that the photocatalysts
preferably contain the most active anatase phase which is consistent
with XRD results, thus confirming the presence of anatase phase in
the prepared mesoporous TiO2. From the view of the spectra,
it is clearly understood that the main features of pure TiO2 and its metal-decorated mesoporous TiO2 are quite similar,
suggesting that the anatase phases of the NPs possess a certain degree
of long-range order.17 While comparing
in a closer view, it is seen that the Raman bands shift toward higher
wavenumber and their intensities relatively decrease in metal-decorated
mesoporous TiO2 (Figure 1C inset). These observed shifts might be due to the
effect of metal (Au and Ag) NPs.17,18 When metals
are deposited on TiO2, two effects may occur on the vibrational
properties of the TiO2. First, the volume contraction might
occur within TiO2 NPs because of the addition of metal
(Au and Ag) NPs. The specific interaction that occurs on the surface
of TiO2 while adding metal NPs causes size-induced radial
pressure and disrupts the interatomic distances within TiO2 NPs which lead to increase of force constant.18b As in vibrational transitions, the wavenumber varies approximately
in proportion to k1/2, where k is the force constant. As a result, the Raman bands shift toward
a higher wavenumber because of the increasing force constants while
adding metal NPs incorporated within the pores of TiO2 NSPs.17,18 Second, the contraction effect induces a decrease in the vibrational
amplitude of the nearest neighbor bonds because of the increase of
the mean square relative displacement, which can be interpreted as
a measure of the static disorder and thermal vibrational disorder
of the material. This decrease in vibrational amplitude with the addition
of metal NPs affects the intensity of the Raman bands. Hence, the
variation in the Raman spectra of mesoporous TiO2 NSPs
after the addition of metal NPs is due to the force constants and
vibrational amplitudes of the nearest neighbor.17,18 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm (Figure 1D) for the mesoporous TiO2, displayed a typical type-IV isotherm curve with H4 hysteresis
loop (according to IUPAC classification), the characteristic of mesoporous
solids, in the range of 0.6–0.85 P/P0, indicates the presence of mesoporosity suggesting
that the adsorption is due to the mesopore channels and not by the
interstitial voids between aggregates among the assembled NPs.15 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement
for TiO2 showed the specific surface area as 173 m2/g. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method analysis
revealed the pore size and pore volume of TiO2 as 3.3 nm
and 0.30 cm3/g, respectively. Interestingly, the pore size
distribution shows that the formed pores are very narrow in size (10–30
Å). This further confirms the existence of well-ordered nature
of the mesoporous.5b,5d The physicochemical properties
of the mesoporous plasmonic TiO2 catalysts are tabulated
in Table 1. The surface
area, pore volume, and pore size of the photocatalyst slightly decreased
after the addition of noble metal NPs which further confirms the metal
deposited on the pore void of the TiO2 NSPs. Even though,
the small reduction of the surface area due to the presence of Au
or Ag NPs is more beneficial for the photocatalytic reactions as they
facilitate good interfacial charge transfer between target organic
pollutant and TiO2 NSPs.3e,8f,10a,10b

The morphology of the as-synthesized mesoporous TiO2 is analyzed using SEM. It is evident from the micrograph
that ∼5–6
nm sized TiO2 NPs aggregates as clusters resulting in the
formation of mesoporous spherical shape (Supporting Information Figure S1 inset). The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis further examined the morphology,
particle size and shape of the synthesized mesoporous TiO2 and metal (Au and Ag) NPs decorated mesoporous TiO2. Figure 2A shows that relatively
rough surfaces with the ∼250 nm sized hierarchical NSPs were
formed by the aggregation of the TiO2 NPs and the average
size of the primary particles is found to be around ∼5 nm which
is in good agreement with the XRD analysis. The HRTEM (Figure 2A inset) clearly shows the
crystalline anatase phase of the particle is evident from the clear
lattice fringes with an inter-planar spacing of d = 0.35 nm which is observed at higher magnifications. The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2B) shows a sequence of broad diffraction
rings, that matches well with the (101), (004), (200), and (211) reflections
of the anatase phase. The observed diffractions along with the uniform
intensity of the rings support explicitly a random orientation of
highly crystalline mesoporous TiO2. The chemical composition
is confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) analysis as
shown in Figure S1. The HRTEM images show
that the dark spherical spots clearly indicate that the uniform size
and shaped ultra-small Ag (∼3 nm) (Figure 2C) and Au (∼2 nm) (Figure 2E) NPs are highly dispersed
on mesoporous TiO2 matrix. The 2D lattice fringe of the
HRTEM images (Figure 2C,E insets) is found to be 0.24 and 0.20 nm for Ag and Au NPs, respectively.
Corresponding SAED patterns (Figure 2D,F) obtained by directing the incident electron beam
perpendicular to one of the square facets of the cube shows that the
square spot array is indexed to four clear diffraction rings that
are assignable to planes of the fcc pattern of metals. The presence
of metals is further confirmed by EDAX analysis (Figure S2). The highly crystalline, ultrasmall metal NPs decorated
anatase phase TiO2 with mesoporous structure is expected
to enhance the efficiency of the photocatalyst for the degradation
of textile dyes.

A slight shift was observed while comparing the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks (Figure 3A) of Au–TiO2 NSPs (458.82
and 464.71 eV) and Ag–TiO2 NSPs (458.88 and 464.59
eV) with that of TiO2 NSPs (458.50 and 464.21 eV) and this
suggests that Au NPs or Ag NPs strongly interacted with Ti atom.8h,10b The observed spin–orbit splitting value of ∼5.7 eV
in all samples suggests that Ti exists in the IV oxidation state (Ti4+).8h,10a,10b The wide and asymmetric O 1s spectra (Figure 3B) were observed along with a higher binding
energy shift in the case of Au–TiO2 NSPs and Ag–TiO2 NSPs when compared with bare TiO2 NSPs. This confirmed
the presence of more than one component and the strong binding of
Au or Ag NPs on the surface of TiO2. The Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks were centered at 82.46 and 86.06 eV
in the high-resolution Au 4f X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
spectra (Figure 3C).10a,11c,11d This demonstrates the characteristic
of the Au cubic crystal with the spin–orbit splitting value
of 3.6 eV. The Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks were
located at 367.95 and 373.95 eV which show a spin–orbit splitting
value is 6.0 eV and this confirms the metallic silver.10a All these results obtained from the XPS concluded
that the metallic state of Au and Ag are present in Au–TiO2 NSPs and Ag–TiO2 NSPs, respectively, and
the same observation was observed in the XRD and Raman spectra. The
charge recombination behavior and the migration efficiency of the
as-synthesized samples were determined using the photoluminescence
(PL) measurements. The PL spectrum of pure TiO2 NSPs excited
at a wavelength of 325 nm (Figure 3D) exhibits broad bands with high intensity in the
350–600 region which corresponds to the radiative recombination
of self-trapped excitons.19 The dramatic
decrease in the emission of the broad bands was observed in the PL
spectra of Au–TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 NSPs. In particular, the emission intensity of Au–TiO2 NSPs was quenched completely because the presence of Au NSPs
effectively trapped the excited electrons and promote into the surface
reactions, thus increasing the lifetime of the excitons. These fluorescence
behaviors suggest the better photocatalytic activity of Au–TiO2 NSPs toward the degradation of azo dyes under direct sunlight
irradiation.8e

Photocatalytic Degradation
Studies
The photocatalytic
activity of mesoporous TiO2 and metal (Au and Ag) decorated
mesoporous TiO2 and Degussa P25 were evaluated for the
degradation of textile dyes. Initially, the control experiment (dye
+ solar light; dye + catalyst) shows no change in the initial absorption
intensity of dyes. However, a slight reduction in the initial absorption
was observed due to the adsorption of the dye molecules on the photocatalyst
surface. Once the photocatalyst was added in the presence of solar
light, the absorption intensity was decreased with respect to time,
suggesting that the dyes are gradually degraded in the presence of
a photocatalyst under direct solar light irradiation as shown in Figure 4A–D. The photocatalytic
degradation of azo dyes (5 × 10–5 M) in the
presence of various photocatalysts (0.5 g L–1) and
the variation of normalized −ln Ct/C0 of dye concentration
as a function of solar irradiation time gives a straight line (Figure 5A–D). The
rate constant (k′) for the degradation reaction
is calculated from the slopes of linearized straight lines obtained
from the plot of −ln Ct/C0 versus time is shown in Table 2. The results clearly
denoted that the photocatalytic degradation reaction is found to follow
“pseudo-first-order kinetics”.3a,3b,3d−3f,8d−8f,11a,14 Further, the percentage of degradation of dye was calculated from
the following expression, and their results are given in the Figure S3.  where C0 is the
initial concentration of the dye solution, Ct is the concentration remaining after irradiation
at the time. The half-life of dye degradation was calculated using
the formula t1/2 = ln 2/k = 0.6931/k and their results are given in Table S1. Further, the experiments conducted
under the same condition using visible light through cut off the UV
portion in the solar light are shown in Figure 6A–D. The above results denote that
the photocatalytic activities are in the following order: P25 <
mesoporous TiO2 < mesoporous Ag–TiO2 < mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs under both direct
solar light and visible light irradiation. It clearly indicates that
the mesoporous anatase TiO2 NSPs show better photocatalytic
activity compared with TiO2 Degussa P25 under both direct
solar and visible light irradiation. The anatase phase, a continuous
framework made up of small particles and mesoporous nature with the
high surface area, provides active sites for the adsorption of dyes
which paves way for the enhanced photocatalytic reaction through the
dye-sensitized mechanism.5b,11e Further, ultrasmall
plasmonic metal (Au and Ag) NP-decorated mesoporous TiO2 NSPs exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the mesoporous
TiO2. Upon solar light irradiation, Fermi levels of the
ultrasmall Au or Ag NPs and the TiO2 start to equilibrate
this electron flow from the conduction band of TiO2 to
Au or Ag surface owing to their electron accepting nature. The Fermi
level of ultrasmall (∼2 nm) Au or Ag NPs is greatly shifted
to more negative potential (Scheme 1), and the resultant interfacial charge-transfer process
is greatly enhanced.3a,8h,9,10,11a,11c,11d,14 Therefore, the electron density in the conduction band of TiO2 is reduced which leads to an increase in active holes in
the photocatalytic system. Subsequently, the injected electrons are
transferred to the ubiquitously present molecular oxygen to form numbers
of powerful oxidative radicals resulting in the effective degradation
of dyes.3a,8h,9,10,11a,11c,11d,14 The mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs shows ∼twofold
higher catalytic activity compared with mesoporous Ag–TiO2 NSPs. Because the work function of the Au (5.1 eV) effectively
scavenge the excitons than that of Ag NPs (4.77 eV), Au NPs prevent
the charge carrier recombination leading to greater activity.

The photocatalytic degradation reaction
highly depends on the formation
of oxidative radicals during the photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytically
generated hydroxyl radicals were identified through the PL technique
using terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule. The TA reacts with
the formed hydroxyl radical to form 2-hydroxy TA.8e,8f,20 The PL intensity of TA changes with respect
to the formation of 2-hydroxy TA.20 The
control experiments (TA + catalyst; TA + solar light) does not alter
the PL intensity of TA. However, the intensity of TA is increased
with respect to time in the presence of both catalyst and solar light
irradiation because the photocatalytically generated hydroxyl radicals
react with TA to form hydroxyl TA. As shown in Figure 7A, the generation of hydroxyl radicals increased
incrementally in the presence of mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs under direct solar light irradiation, evidencing for its higher
photocatalytic degradation efficiency. Further, the photocatalytically
formed 2-hydroxy TA profile of mesoporous TiO2, Ag–TiO2, Au–TiO2 NSPs, and TiO2 degussa
P25 under identical condition are shown in Figure 7B. The concentration of 2-hydroxy TA increased
in the following order: mesoporous Au–TiO2 >
Ag–TiO2 > mesoporous TiO2 > TiO2–Degussa
P25 which clearly evidence the correlation between the hydroxyl radical
generation and photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes. Further, the
similar experiments were carried out under visible light irradiation,
and the results denoted that the concentration of 2-hydroxy TA is
very low in the case of mesoporous TiO2 and TiO2 Degussa P25 (Figure 7B), owing to their wide band gap which limits the visible light absorption.4a However, the concentration of 2-hydroxy TA is
reasonably high in the presence of mesoporous Au–TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 NSPs and comparatively mesoporous
Au–TiO2 NSPs show higher PL intensity of 2-hydroxy
TA than mesoporous Ag–TiO2 NSPs. The above study
indicated that the uniformly distributed ultrasmall plasmonic Au and
Ag NPs on the mesoporous TiO2 NSPs increase the visible
light absorption as a result, enhancing incident photo-conversion
efficiency. The formation of Schottky barriers between the ultrasmall
plasmonic metal NPs and mesoporous TiO2 upon irradiation
which facilitate to shift of Fermi level to more negative potential
leads to increase the lifetime of charge carriers.9,10b,11b Therefore, this energy barrier will suppress
the recombination reaction between the photogenerated electrons and
holes. Thus, the effective transfers of photogenerated electrons occur
and participate with surface-adsorbed oxygen to form more numbers
of active oxidative species. These active oxidative species are reasonable
for the effective degradation of dyes.2a,8h,9,10 Further, the concentration
of 2-hydroxy TA is estimated by using a predetermined calibration
curve (Figure 7C and
inset), and the results are shown in Figure 7D. The obtained results evidently correlate
the amount of photocatalytically generated hydroxyl radicals in the
presence of various photocatalysts and their amount of dye degradation.
The amount of dye degradation increases with respect to the photocatalytically
generated HO•. However, the amount of dye degradation
is higher than that of the formed HO• which could
be equilibrated with the surface-trapped holes. These results concluded
that the surface deposited ultrasmall Au and Ag NPs are responsible
for the generation of more numbers of HO• which
might be equilibrated with the surface-trapped holes. These two powerful
oxidative species are synergistically involved in the photocatalytic
degradation of azo dyes.2a,3a,3b,4a,8e,8h,9,10,11e,11f,20b

CR, MO, RR and AO10 are congo red, methyl orange, remazol red, and

The degradation of the azo dyes is easy to monitor through
their
optical intensity as shown in Figure 4A–D. The main characteristic band responsible
for the chromophoric group of azo dyes CR, MO, AO10, and remazol red
(RR) appear at visible region 497, 487, 484, and 521 nm, respectively.
During the degradation process, the characteristic absorbance bands
decrease rapidly because of the fragmentation of azo links in the
case of azo dyes and aromatic rings. As the time of irradiation extended,
the absorbance bands of the dyes get reduced. These results indicate
that the first step must be an oxidative process that leads to the
cleavage of chromophoric N=N bonds,2a−2c,4a,10a responsible for the
decoloration of the azo compounds and further “benzene-like”
intermediate are also deconstructed to a certain extent during the
photocatalytic reaction. The above discussion was confirmed through
total organic carbon (TOC) analysis Figure 8A, which indicates that in the presence of
a catalyst, the rate of mineralization of dyes was low when compared
with the rate of photocatalytic degradation observed through spectrophotometrically.
Generally, complete mineralization of dyes requires an extended irradiation,
owing to the fact that its mineralization mandates completion of two
different stages: the ring cleavage of dye molecules in the initial
photocatalytic degradation stage and subsequent oxidation of the fragments
in the latter stage.2b,8e−8g,14 The mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs exhibited
above 85% TOC removal within 7 h for all azo dyes under solar light
irradiation because of it’s higher photocatalytic efficiency.
The reusability of the TiO2 nanocomposites is depicted
in Figure 8B. In all
seven cycles, the catalyst showed the equal photocatalytic efficiency.
It is henceforth considered as an indirect evidence for the porous
structural stability.4a,5a,5c,5d The reason for the excellent stability is
due to the confinement of metal NPs within the pores of TiO2. Eventually, in the eighth cycle, the catalyst activity is dropped
nearly to 5% where the structural or morphological changes are assumed
to occur. The efficiency of the photocatalysts was also tested for
other classes of dyes such as RB, MB, Rh B, and Rh 6G and their degradation
kinetics is shown in Figure S4. It has
been found that the Au–TiO2 NSP photocatalyst effectively
degrades thiazine, xanthenes, and rhodamine moieties. Further, to
find out the influence of the tap water on the photocatalytic degradation
of azo dyes, similar experiments were done at identical conditions
as mention above. Figure S5 shows the %
degradation of the dyes in tap water and Milli-Q water in the presence
of mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs. The results denoted
that the percentage of dye degradation in tap water was slightly reduced
(∼8%) compared with dyes at Milli-Q water, owing to the very
small amount of organics, inorganics, and metallic ion species present
in tap water which acts as competing species against the dye molecules
for the catalytic active sites or for oxidization by the radical species
present in solution. Moreover, the position and shape of the characteristic
absorption maxima (λmax) of the tested dyes are unaltered
during the degradation process; also, ∼85% of mineralization
was achieved within a 7 h irradiation period. This might be both dyes
and its degradation intermediates are decomposed unselectively without
generating any long-lived toxic compound. For identification of the
toxicity of photocatalytic degradation intermediate products, the
eco-toxicological experiment was conducted for the dyes and its degradation
intermediates against the luminescent bacteria Vibrio
fischeri through a standard protocol.21 The dyes exhibited moderate toxicity against V. fischeri which was observed from the ∼30%
inhibition in the luminous of the bacteria; additionally, the % luminescence
inhibition increased almost 10–15% of all dyes at 1 h irradiation
because of the formation of degradation intermediates of both azo
and non-azo dyes. However, % luminescence inhibition are gradually
reduced and finally reached to <3 at after 7 h of light irradiation
(Figure S6). These results suggest that
the formed intermediates are removed with respective irradiation time
and these results are support to the above discussion in the mineralization
part. Hence, synthesized TiO2 NSPs and modified ultrasmall
Au and Ag NPs are found to exhibit efficient photocatalytic activity
over textile dyes.

Conclusions
Solvothermally
prepared mesoporous TiO2 NSPs were modified
with ultrasmall Au (2 nm) and Ag (4 nm) plasmonic NPs by the sonochemical
method. The anatase phase of mesoporous TiO2 NSPs in the
size of ∼250 nm which is composed of ∼5–6 nm
sized TiO2 NPs was observed. The band gap of TiO2 was 0.13 and 0.08 eV red-shifted in the case of Au–TiO2 NSPs and Ag–TiO2 NSPs, respectively, which
suggested their visible light absorption ability. Drastic reduction
in the PL intensity of the Au–TiO2 NSPs and Ag–TiO2 NSPs was the primary confirmation for their reduction in
the rate of charge carrier recombination. The photocatalytic results
were denoting that the photocatalytic activity toward the degradation
of azo dyes indicated the following order: P25 < mesoporous TiO2 < mesoporous Ag–TiO2 < mesoporous
Au–TiO2 NSPs under both direct solar light and visible
light irradiation. It was clearly indicated that the mesoporous anatase
TiO2 NSPs showed better photocatalytic efficiency when
compared with TiO2 Degussa P25 under both direct solar
and visible light irradiation. The mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs showed ∼twofold higher catalytic activity compared with
mesoporous Ag–TiO2 NSPs. The study about the formation
of HO• radical clearly supported the above photocatalytic
activity of all of the catalysts. The mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs exhibited above 85% of TOC removal within 7 h for all
azo dyes under solar light irradiation because of their higher photocatalytic
efficiency. Thus, mesoporous Au–TiO2 NSPs is a good
choice for quick cleaning of the large volume of industrial wastewater
just by exploiting the sunlight.

Experimental Details
Materials
Titanium isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
was used as a precursor for the preparation of mesoporous NSPs, and
titanium dioxide (Degussa P25, Germany, specific surface area of 57
m2 g–1) was used as a reference photocatalyst.
Silver nitrate and chloroauric acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA. Sodium borohydride (Loba Chemie), absolute ethanol (Merck, >99.9%),
and analytical grade of CR, MO, AO10, RR, RB, MB, Rh B, and Rh 6G
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA, and used as such without further
purification. Water purified in a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA) was used for the preparation of solutions.

Synthesis of
Mesoporous TiO2 NSPs
Mesoporous
TiO2 was prepared by the simple solvothermal method.15 A typical synthesis involves dropwise addition
of titanium isopropoxide (20 mL) into ultrapure ethanol (100 mL) under
constant stirring, 5 mL of double-distilled water was then added drop-by-drop
to the suspension and stirred for 30 min under continuous stirring
at ambient conditions, and the whole suspension was transferred to
a Teflon beaker and kept closed in a stainless steel autoclave and
heated at 120 °C for 12 h. The obtained white slurry was washed
several times with distilled water, dried at 100 °C for 12 h
and calcined at 400 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace at a ramp
rate of 5 °C/min where nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 NSPs were stored for further use.

Synthesis of Mesoporous
Au (or) Ag–TiO2 NSPs
The as-synthesized
TiO2 NSPs were used directly as templates
for the nucleation and growth of metal NPs (Ag and Au) over their
surface. The sonochemical approach has been utilized to encapsulate
Au and Ag NPs in the pore channels of mesoporous TiO2 NSPs
where the air entrapped in the mesoporous matrix was selectively removed
by sonication and metal species were driven into the pores.13b In a typical procedure, mesoporous TiO2 NSPs (1 g) was dispersed ultrasonically in Milli-Q water
(100 mL) for 5 min followed by the addition of a metal precursor (40
mg) under sonication for 30 min (pH = 7). NaBH4 (0.25 mM)
previously dissolved in Milli-Q water (10 mL) was added as a reducing
agent and kept in a sonication bath for 30 min. The product obtained
was washed several times with Milli-Q water, dried at 100 °C
for 12 h, and used for further applications.

Characterization Studies
Diffuse reflectance spectra
(DRS) of the samples were recorded using a Shimadzu UV–vis
spectrophotometer (UV-2550) fitted with ISR-2200 DRS accessory. Solid-state
PL spectra were recorded in a Shimadzu RF-5301 spectrofluorophotometer.
Material-phase analysis was carried out by a powder XRD technique
(Rigaku diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å
and step size 0.02°). Surface morphology and grain size of the
samples were examined using a Quanta 200 field emission gun scanning
electron microscope and a TECNAI G2 model transmission
electron microscope (TEM). The surface area, pore volume, and pore
diameter of the samples were measured with the assistance of surface
area analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2030) which provides the single-point
and multipoint BET surface area measurements. The extent of photocatalytic
degradation of the target organic pollutants (dyes) was followed spectrophotometrically.

Evaluation of Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic
activity of the prepared nanocatalysts was studied by assessing the
photocatalytic degradation of dyes in the presence of solar radiation
(intensity ≈ 85–95 mW/cm2). For the experiments
in the visible light, the UV portion of the irradiated light (λ
≤ 395 nm) was obstructed using a UV filter film (Solaronix-Switzerland).
The photocatalytic degradation reactions were conducted in a borosilicate
glass vessel of 125 mL capacity. An appropriate amount of catalyst
was added into 100 mL of aqueous dye solution of desired concentration.
To ensure the adsorption equilibrium, the solution containing the
photocatalyst was stirred for 45 min in the dark (prior to light irradiation).
The concentration of the dyes was measured at this condition from
their characteristic absorption maxima (λmax) of
the dyes CR, MO, AO10, RR, RB, MB, Rh B, and Rh 6G are 497, 487, 484,
514, 540, 663, 553, and 525 nm, respectively, the molecular structure
of the dyes are given in Figures S7 and S8 and utilized as the initial concentration (C0) for further kinetic analysis. Around 5 mL of aliquots were
withdrawn from the reaction mixture after a certain period of light
irradiation. The catalyst present in the aliquot solutions was removed
by filtration (0.2 μm polyvinylidene fluoride syringe filter),
and the concentration of the dyes in the filtrate was determined through
a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The concentration of the dyes obtained
after a certain period of irradiation (t) is denoted
as Ct. All photocatalytic
experiments were carried out at natural pH of the dye solution. The
TOC content was examined using a Shimadzu TOC VCPH model
TOC analyzer. TOC0 is the TOC measured after the equilibrium
adsorption and the TOC obtained at certain irradiation time is denoted
as TOCt. Triplicate experiments were conducted
at optimized conditions and the mean values of the results are presented
along with the standard deviations of triplicate experiments.
