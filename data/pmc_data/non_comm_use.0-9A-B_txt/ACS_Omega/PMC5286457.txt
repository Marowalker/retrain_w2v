Azoles are a class of antimicrobial
drugs used clinically to treat
yeast and fungal infections. Against pathogenic yeast and fungi, azoles
act by inhibiting the activity of the cytochrome P450 Cyp51, which
is involved in the synthesis of a critical component of the yeast
and fungal cell membrane. Azoles have antibacterial activity, including
against mycobacteria, but the basis for this activity is not well-understood.
We demonstrated that imidazoles are bactericidal to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A marked increase in
reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed within imidazole-treated M. tuberculosis. The generation of ROS did not appear
to be related to the mechanism of killing of imidazoles, as the addition
of antioxidants or altered expression of detoxifying enzymes had no
effect on growth. We examined the metabolic changes induced by econazole
treatment in both wild-type and econazole-resistant mutant strains
of M. tuberculosis. Econazole treatment
induced changes in carbohydrates, amino acids, and energy metabolism
in both strains. Notably, the untreated mutant strain had a metabolic
profile similar to the wild-type drug-treated cells, suggesting that
adaptation to similar stresses may play a role in econazole resistance.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB),
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, now ranks as a leading cause of death worldwide.1 In 2014, 9.6 million people were newly diagnosed with TB
and 1.5 million people died.1 Globally,
3.3% of new cases and 20% of those previously treated had multidrug
resistant TB.1 In addition to the current
active burden of diseases, roughly one-third of the world’s
population is latently infected with TB, with 5–10% of this
population expected to develop active TB at some point in their lifetime.2 Given the current and estimated future incidence
of TB, there is a pressing need to develop new TB drugs and to understand
the biology of this organism in response to the drug treatment.

Bioinformatic analysis of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence revealed a surprisingly large number of cytochrome
P450 mono-oxygenases (P450s).3M. tuberculosis has 20 P450s, whereas previously
sequenced bacterial genomes had indicated that these enzymes were
rare in bacteria. Interestingly, one of the M. tuberculosis P450s is found to be a homolog of the eukaryotic 14α-sterol
demethylases (CYP51), the target of the imidazole class of drugs commonly
used in the treatment of fungal infections. CYP51 is involved in the
synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component in the cell wall of
yeast and fungi.4 Imidazoles bind to the M. tuberculosis CYP51,5 as well as several other P450s, notably CYP121,6 CYP130,7 CYP125,8 and CYP144.9 Imidazoles have
antimycobacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo,10 with activity against persistent bacteria.11

Imidazole resistance in fungi is mediated by increased
levels of
the cellular target, decreased affinity of the target for imidazole
binding, upregulation of genes controlling drug efflux, and alterations
in sterol synthesis.12 In M. tuberculosis, mutations in Rv0678 confer resistance
to imidazoles.13,14 Rv0678 is a transcriptional regulator
of the mmpS5-mmpL5 efflux system.14 Thus, it appears that resistance to imidazoles
in M. tuberculosis is via increased
efflux from the cell rather than alterations in target levels or specificity.

The mode of action of imidazoles in M. tuberculosis is still unclear. The binding of imidazoles to multiple P450s, none
of which are essential for bacterial growth in vitro, suggests that
these enzymes may not be the actual targets but instead act to dilute
the amount of drugs available within the cell to interact with their
true target(s). Another possibility is that there is no single target
and that imidazoles have a general toxic effect to M. tuberculosis.

In this study, we show that
econazole is bactericidal to M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate that econazole exposure
leads to a rapid and transient increase in reactive oxygen species
(ROS) within M. tuberculosis, but this
effect does not appear to contribute to the bactericidal activity.
We also profile the metabolome of wild-type and econazole-resistant
bacteria, which suggest that econazole treatment leads to global metabolic
adaptations. These appear to be primarily a mechanism to respond to
the drug action because the (untreated) resistant mutant resembled
wild-type bacteria after exposure to econazole.

Results
Econazole is
Bactericidal to Replicating M. tuberculosis
We are interested in understanding the mode of action of
imidazoles in M. tuberculosis. Imidazoles
inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro,10,11 but it is not clear whether this
translates into bacterial killing. We determined whether econazole
was able to kill M. tuberculosis under
normal aerobic culture conditions. We exposed M. tuberculosis H37Rv to econazole concentrations (from 5 to 200 μM) over
28 days and monitored viability by colony counts (Figure 1). We saw concentration-dependent
kill.

Figure 1 Econazole is bactericidal against M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis H37Rv LP was incubated
with varying concentrations of econazole under aerobic growth conditions
in standing culture. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were determined over
28 days.

At the highest concentration used
(200 μM), there were no
viable colonies obtained within 7 days representing >3 logs kill
(limit
of detection was 100 CFU). Similarly, at 20 and 100 μM, the
kill was seen, with sterilization of cultures by day 14. The lowest
concentration tested resulted in growth inhibition, with a small increase
in CFU over 21 days (∼50-fold increase, compared with >4
×
103 log increase in the control). Thus, we see that econazole
has bactericidal activity against actively growing M. tuberculosis.

Imidazoles Induce Reactive
Oxygen Species Production in M. tuberculosis
The induction of ROS has
been suggested as the mechanism by which the bactericidal antibiotics
work.15 The antitubercular agent clofazimine
works by inducing oxidative stress via ROS,16 and M. tuberculosis is sensitive
to endogenous oxidative stress17 and to
killing by a vitamin C-mediated Fenton reaction.18,19 In addition, the mechanism of action of miconazole in fungi is by
the production of ROS generated by respiration.20 By contrast, other studies have indicated that ROS is not
responsible for the killing of bacteria by antibiotics.21−24 We took several approaches to determine if this could be how imidazoles
kill M. tuberculosis. First, we measured
the production of ROS in M. tuberculosis upon incubation with imidazoles using a fluorescent reporter (Figure S1). We used the reporter 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin
diacetate (DCFDA), which is commonly used to detect ROS or more generally
oxidative stress. DCFDA is converted into a fluorescent form after
oxidation, which can be mediated by a number of different molecules
including hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals.25

We observed a concentration-dependent increase in
ROS levels in response to econazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and
miconazole (Figure 2). We did not detect an increase in the ROS levels in response to
incubation with isoniazid (data not shown) or rifampicin (Figure 2), suggesting that
this was a response specific for the imidazole class. Our data for
rifampicin are consistent with previous works that showed that in
vitro it was not able to induce oxidative stress.26

Figure 2 Imidazoles induce ROS in M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis strains were cultured
aerobically. Bacteria were loaded with DCFDA and incubated with the
indicated concentrations of (A) econazole, (B) clotrimazole, (C) ketoconazole,
(D) miconazole, or (E) rifampicin for 90 min before fluorescence was
measured. Background fluorescence was subtracted from each value shown.
The strains were H37Rv (LP) wild-type, the econazole-resistant mutant
LP-0105935-RM5 (Rv0678 R72P), and Δcyp125.

Superoxide Dismutase Does Not Protect M. tuberculosis from Killing by Imidazoles
If ROS were responsible for
the bactericidal activity of azoles, we would expect that the detoxification
of oxygen radicals would be protective against imidazoles. To test
this, we generated a strain of M. tuberculosis capable of overexpressing the superoxide dismutase SodC (Rv0432).
We used an anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter to control the SodC
expression. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
for econazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole against the wild-type
and SodC overexpressing (OE) strains (Table 1) under both inducing (aTc) and noninducing
conditions (no aTc) (Table 2).

medium. H37Rv (LP): ATCC 25618 was the parental strain. Anhydrotetracycline
(150 ng/mL) was added to induce the expression of sodC from the tetracycline-inducible promoter where noted.

We noted a small shift in MICs (2–4
fold) between the wild-type
and SodC-OE strains, but this shift was seen under both induced and
noninduced conditions. The largest shift was seen with clotrimazole.
Because the shift, if any, was relatively small, we considered that
SodC overexpression was not able to mitigate the effect of azole activity.
However, because we do not have a positive control that is known to
induce ROS in M. tuberculosis, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the SodC expression levels were not high
enough to effect a difference in ROS defense.

To further examine
the relationship between ROS detoxification
and imidazole susceptibility, we determined MICs for two strains with katG deletion (Table 3). If ROS generation were responsible for killing of M. tuberculosis by imidazoles, we might expect that
the lack of a functional catalase gene would make the bacteria more
sensitive to these drugs. The MIC for the two mutant strains tested
was nearly identical to the parental strain for econazole, clotrimazole,
ketoconazole, and miconazole. M. tuberculosis has a number of other enzymes involved in oxidative defenses, but
because KatG normally plays a major role, we would have expected to
see a difference.

Induction of ROS Is Not
Linked to Imidazole MICs
If
ROS generation is responsible for imidazole-mediated killing of M. tuberculosis, we reasoned that a strain, which
is more sensitive to imidazoles, would have increased the ROS production
or at least that the ROS production would be induced at lower concentrations.
We tested this using a Δcyp125 strain;28 this strain has an unmarked, in-frame deletion
of cyp125, and we have previously shown that is more
sensitive to growth inhibition by imidazoles.28 We also used the cyp125-complemented strain. We
included a strain that is slightly more resistant to imidazoles owing
to the increased expression of the MmpL5-MmpS5 efflux system (LP-0105935-RM5;
Rv0678 R72P).13 We determined the MIC for
several imidazoles (Table 4).

As expected, the Δcyp125 strain
was slightly
more sensitive, and the Rv0678 mutant was slightly more resistant—approximately
2–3 fold difference between strains. Although these differences
were small, they were reproducible and we reasoned that we would expect
to see differences in ROS generation. ROS generation was measured
in the Cyp125 deletion and econazole-resistant strains exposed to
the four imidazoles (Figure 2). ROS generation was highest in the imidazole-resistant strain
relative to the wild-type for all drugs in this class (Figure 2). The values for the more
sensitive Δcyp125 were slightly higher than those for the wild-type
(Figure 2). We calculated
half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values to determine
whether there were differences in the concentrations required to elicit
an increase in ROS between the three strains (Table 5). The values were similar between all strains,
and if anything ROS generation was lower in the Δcyp125 strain for ketoconazole (the opposite of that predicted). These
results suggest that the generation of ROS is not directly linked
to the sensitivity of M. tuberculosis to imidazole drugs because we saw no correlation.

Antioxidants Are Not Protective
against Imidazole Activity
The induction of isocitrate lyase
in response to the treatment
with isoniazid, rifampicin, and streptomycin has been reported and
linked to antioxidant defense.30 Icl function
was required for defense against all three compounds because an icl1/2 deletion strain was more sensitive,
and this could be reversed by coincubation with an antioxidant.30 We tested whether imidazoles might have similar
activity using the icl1/2 deletion
strain or inclusion of antioxidants in the medium as previously used
by others.30 We determined the MIC for
four imidazole drugs against the Erdman, Δicl1/2, icl1 C′, and icl1 OE strains
(Table 6).

(μM) were determined against each strain cultured in a liquid

was added to induce the expression of icl1 from the
tetracycline-inducible promoter where noted.

The presence or absence of icl1 had
no effect
on the growth of M. tuberculosis when
incubated with econazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, or miconazole.
The overexpression of icl1 had no effect on growth
at any of the concentrations of these compounds that we tested. Interestingly,
we observed higher levels of ROS generation in the Δicl1/2 strain in response to incubation with imidazoles
(Figure 3). Because
we saw no difference in MIC with these compounds in either strain,
this suggests that Icl may play a role in the antioxidant defense
but that this effect does not protect M. tuberculosis from the action of imidazoles. Given its role in the glyoxylate
shunt, it is likely that Icl is required to divert metabolism and
prevent ROS accumulation.

Figure 3 Icl1 protects against ROS induced by imidazoles. M. tuberculosis strains were loaded with DCFDA and
incubated with concentrations of econazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole,
or miconazole for 90 min before fluorescence was measured. Strains
were Erdman wild-type and the double mutant Δicl1/2.

We also evaluated the effect of
adding antioxidants (Table 7). The addition of 1 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NALC), which acts by increasing
the cellular pools of antioxidants, did not alter the MIC of econazole,
clotrimazole, or ketoconazole. The inclusion of 1 mM Tempol, a superoxide
scavenger, or 5 mM thiourea did not lead to an increase in MIC. These
results indicate that none of these antioxidants are capable of protecting M. tuberculosis from growth inhibition by imidazoles.

ROS Induction Is a Transient
Effect
The rapid increase
in ROS levels induced by imidazoles initially suggested that it could
be a cause of the bactericidal activity of these drugs. However, the
lack of effect of superoxide dismutase overexpression, catalase mutations,
or antioxidants suggests that this is not the case. We evaluated the
longevity of the increased ROS levels observed by incubating M. tuberculosis with sublethal concentrations of
econazole and by measuring ROS levels over 7 days (Figure 4). We saw that the induction
of ROS was short-lived; an increase was observed at 90 min, but this
had reduced to background by 24 h of drug exposure. No further induction
was seen at 72 or 144 h. These results indicate that the rapid increase
in ROS initially observed with econazole treatment is resolved within
the first 24 h of exposure, providing further evidence that ROS generation
is not responsible for the bactericidal activity of imidazoles in M. tuberculosis.

Figure 4 Econazole-mediated induction of ROS is
transient. M. tuberculosis was exposed
to econazole in culture.
Bacteria were loaded with DCFDA, and the fluorescence was measured.

Econazole Induces Global
Metabolic Changes in M. tuberculosis
To gain better understanding
of the global effects of imidazole activity on M. tuberculosis at a biochemical level, we undertook metabolomic analysis of the
wild-type M. tuberculosis and the resistant
mutant following econazole treatment. Antibiotic concentrations were
selected, which slightly reduced the growth rate (Figure S2). A total of 141 named biochemicals were identified
spanning 8 superpathways and 43 subpathways. Table S1 contains the complete data set with normalized metabolite
measurements and pathway associations.

A strong signature across
the data set involved alterations in pathways supporting the cell
wall synthesis. N-Acetylglucosamine, a key component
of peptidoglycan,31 was significantly decreased
with both 5 and 10 μM econazole treatment in the wild-type strain
(Figure 5). Similarly,
mannose, mannose-1-phosphate, and inositol-1-phosphate (Figure 5) were significantly decreased
in the presence of econazole. These are all intermediates in the cell
wall biosynthesis for components such as phosphatidylmyoinositol mannosides
(PIMs), lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan.32 The precursors of these metabolites, such as glucose-6-phosphate,
fructose-6-phosphate, glucosamine-6-phosphate, and mannose-6-phosphate,
were elevated in the treated wild-type samples (Figure 5). Trehalose-6-phosphate, which is important
for the incorporation of mycolic acids into the cell wall and synthesized
from glucose-6-phosphate and glucose, was also found to be significantly
decreased in econazole-treated cells (Figure 5). Because we saw changes in the cell wall,
we looked at the effect of econazole on membrane potential (Figure S3) and mycolic acid production (data
not shown).

Figure 5 Metabolomic signatures in the wild-type and resistant mutant strains
after exposure to econazole: changes in the cell wall metabolites.
Box plots show the levels of metabolites present in H37Rv (LP) and
LP-0105935-RMS ± econazole. Data are the average of six replicates.
Metabolites highlighted here are important for cell wall synthesis
through the indicated pathways.

Comparison of the levels of these metabolites in the untreated
resistant strain revealed changes that were similar to those of the
treated wild-type strain. Differences included higher levels of glucose-6-phosphate,
fructose-6-phosphate, glucosamine-6-phosphate, and mannose-6-phosphate
as well as lower levels of N-acetylglucosamine, mannose,
mannose-1-phosphate, inositol-1-phosphate, and trehalose-6-phosphate
(Figure 5). Econazole
treatment led to
similar changes in the levels of metabolites related to PIM synthesis
between the wild-type and resistant mutant strains. By contrast, the
levels of glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and glucosamine-6-phosphate
decreased in the resistant mutant strain with econazole treatment
as opposed to the increased levels observed in the wild-type strain
(Figure 5). Trehalose
also decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner in the resistant
mutant but not in the wild-type strain, in the presence of econazole
(Table S1).

In addition to the utilization
of glucose through glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphate
may also be shunted through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to
generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) for lipid
biosynthesis, as well as for reducing equivalents and ribose-5-phosphate
for nucleotide synthesis. Levels of the PPP intermediate 6-phosphogluconate
and 5-phosphoribosyl diphosphate (PRPP), a key metabolite in the nucleotide
synthesis generated from ribose-5-phosphate, were significantly higher
in the resistant mutant strain as compared with the wild-type (Figure 6). These observations
may indicate increased PPP activity in the resistant mutant strain
that may influence the availability of NADPH. As 6-phosphogluconate
and PRPP were also increased in the wild-type cells exposed to econazole
(Figure 6), elevated
PPP activity may contribute to the drug resistance phenotype of the
resistant mutant strain.

resistant mutant strains

levels of metabolites present in H37Rv (LP) and LP-0105935-RM5 ±
econazole. Data are the average of six replicates. Metabolites highlighted
here are important for glycolysis and the PPPs.

M. tuberculosis can use modified
versions of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to conserve carbon
atoms during the metabolism of acetyl-CoA produced from the glycolysis
and/or oxidation of even-numbered fatty acids (via the glyoxylate
cycle) and propionyl-CoA produced from the oxidation of odd-chain
fatty acids (via the methylcitrate cycle) for energy production. In
both the presence and absence of econazole, several differences in
metabolite levels suggest differential contribution of these pathways
to energy production in the resistant mutant and wild-type strains.
Higher levels of citrate, succinate, and malate and lower levels of
acetyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate, and fumarate suggest greater dependence
on the glyoxylate cycle in the resistant mutant strain (Figure 7). Similar changes were observed
in the wild-type cells grown in the presence of econazole (Figure 7). Drug treatment
also appeared to induce utilization of the methylcitrate cycle in
both strains as the levels of methylcitrate were below the level of
detection in the untreated samples and rose in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 7).

Discussion
Better
understanding of the sequences of events leading to cell
death from a host of bactericidal antibiotics is necessary for the
development of more effective antibacterial therapies. We have demonstrated
that econazole is bactericidal to M. tuberculosis. We have shown that imidazole drugs induce a rapid increase in ROS
in M. tuberculosis. A previous work
has indicated that the induction of ROS by imidazoles is associated
with killing of other organisms such as Leishmania(33) and Staphylococcus aureus,34 as well as biofilm-associated and
planktonic fungi.35 In addition, miconazole
action against Candida and Saccharomyces involves the generation of ROS by respiration;20 and azole exposure results in metabolic remodeling
toward respiration and increased mitochondrial activity.20 All organisms that undergo aerobic respiration
are subjected to ROS exposure as a byproduct of normal respiration,
including superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxides.
Redox imbalance occurs when endogenous antioxidants fail to cope with
the excessive ROS (both endogenous and exogenous), leading to the
development of oxidative stress. If not effectively controlled, the
accumulation of hydroxyl radicals can kill cells through its numerous
deleterious effects including breakage of nucleic acids, protein carbonylation,
and lipid peroxidation.

We determined that both strains of M. tuberculosis that are either resistant or sensitive
to imidazoles exhibit a concentration-dependent
increase in intracellular ROS upon incubation with imidazoles similar
to the parental strain. The magnitude of the response had no correlation
with the sensitivity of each strain to imidazole drugs, meaning that
the most sensitive strain did not display the highest levels as might
be expected if ROS were the mode of action of these drugs. The imidazole
concentration required to induce the production of ROS within the
cells was equivalent for all strains tested, as demonstrated by similar
EC50 values, again showing no correlation with imidazole
sensitivity to growth inhibition.

To further understand the
relationship between ROS stress and imidazole
killing of M. tuberculosis, we determined
the MIC of strains expressing altered ROS-detoxifying genes. The deletion
of katG or ahpCF has previously
been shown to confer hyperlethality to diverse antibiotics.36 Two M. tuberculosis strains with different versions of nonfunctional katG genes were found to have imidazole MICs identical to the wild-type.
The overexpression of these genes has been shown to mitigate ROS-mediated
damage.37,38 We found that the overexpression of sodC also had little to no effect on imidazole MICs relative
to the wild-type. We evaluated whether the addition of various antioxidants
would be protective to M. tuberculosis upon incubation with imidazoles. Thiourea (a redox-active thiol),
NALC (a thiol-containing antioxidant), and Tempol (a redox-shuttling
nitroxide capable of detoxifying a wide range of ROS and reactive
nitrogen intermediates) all had no effect on imidazole MICs of M. tuberculosis.

A previous work showed a role
for icl1 in antioxidant
defense against antibiotics with diverse modes of action.30 The presence, absence, or increased level of
expression of Icl1 had no discernible effect on the MIC for imidazoles.
Interestingly, we detected much higher levels of ROS produced in response
to imidazole incubation with the Δicl1/2 strain
compared with the parental Erdman strain. The combination of all of
these data suggests that while ROS generation is increased in response
to imidazole exposure within M. tuberculosis bacteria, the bacteria have sufficient detoxifying mechanisms to
prevent an irreparable amount of damage from occurring within the
cells. The lack of cell death directly attributable to ROS production
or activity suggests that imidazoles act by an alternative mechanism
yet to be elucidated.

To better understand the effect of imidazoles
on M. tuberculosis, we conducted metabolomic
analysis
of wild-type and econazole-resistant bacteria exposed to two sublethal
concentrations of econazole for 24 h. A comparison of the global biochemical
profiles revealed many differences in the metabolite levels in response
to econazole treatment in both the wild-type and resistant strains.
In several instances, the levels of metabolites in the untreated resistant
samples were similar to the levels in the treated wild-type strain.
This suggests that the changes we saw upon exposure to econazole were
an adaptive response to drug treatment, rather than a downstream effect
of target inhibition.

Both wild-type and econazole-resistant
strains had numerous alterations
in pathways contributing to the synthesis of cell wall components.
The wild-type strain had decreased in levels of metabolites involved
in peptidoglycan synthesis as well as components of PIMs, lipomannan,
and lipoarabinomannan; however, the precursors of these metabolites
were elevated in the treated wild-type samples. These observations
may reflect either an increased demand for cell wall components in
the presence of econazole or a block in their synthesis that results
in accumulation of these precursors. The untreated econazole-resistant
strain had similar changes to the treated wild-type strain in the
levels of these metabolites. The untreated econazole-resistant strain
contained higher levels of cell wall biosynthesis components than
the treated wild-type strain. Drug treatment led to a significant
decrease in these metabolites, in contrast to the increase observed
in the treated wild-type cells. Taken together, these observations
raise the possibility that the econazole-resistant strain has adapted
to alterations in cell wall synthesis in the absence of the drug that
allows for greater resistance to perturbations induced by econazole
treatment.

Econazole treatment resulted in alterations in metabolism
in both
the wild-type and econazole-resistant strains. The decreased levels
of glucose-6-phosphate observed in the treated econazole-resistant
strain relative to the wild-type strain, coupled with the increased
levels of PPP intermediates may indicate increased PPP activity in
the econazole-resistant strain that could influence the availability
of NADPH. Increased levels of NADPH in the resistant strain could
contribute to the econazole resistance phenotype of this strain owing
to its reducing power by augmenting the ability of these bacteria
to detoxify higher levels of ROS stress compared with the wild-type
strain. The untreated econazole-resistant strain appears to rely more
on the glyoxylate pathway for energy production than the untreated
wild-type strain. Drug treatment induced similar changes in the wild-type
strain, suggesting that the glyoxylate cycle is increased as a result
of drug treatment. Econazole treatment also appeared to induce increased
utilization of the methylcitrate cycle in both the wild-type and resistant
strains.

The changes related to glyoxylate and methylcitrate
cycles may
reflect the increased catabolism of odd- and even-chain fatty acids
to propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Although acetyl-CoA levels decreased
with drug treatment, this hypothesis is supported by increased levels
of medium-chain fatty acids and the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate
(BHBA) along with decreased levels of free coenzyme A (CoA) in both
the wild-type and econazole-resistant strains in response to drug.
The increase in the medium-chain fatty acids and BHBA was greater
in the resistant mutant strain than in the wild-type strain, suggesting
a differential capacity for the catabolism of fatty acids for energy.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that imidazoles induce ROS
in a transient fashion, which is not associated with the bacterial
viability, but that econazole treatment leads to metabolic remodeling,
which may represent adaptations to the drug treatment. Further work
to elucidate whether there is an intracellular target for imidazoles
or whether another general mechanism of death is induced is warranted.

Materials
and Methods
Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Chemicals
M. tuberculosis strains are summarized
in Table 1. Strain
H37Rv (LP) is ATCC 25618; strain H37Rv (MA) is ATCC 27294; strains
were sequenced and several point mutations27 were identified. M. tuberculosis was
grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing 10% v/v OADC (oleic acid,
albumin, dextrose, and catalase) supplement (Becton Dickinson) and
0.05% w/v Tween-80 (7H9-Tw-OADC) or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing
10% v/v OADC. Gentamicin (Sigma) was added to 10 μg/mL and hygromycin
B (Roche) to 50 μg/mL where required.

Determination of Minimum
Inhibitory Concentrations
MICs were determined in a liquid
medium as described previously.39 Briefly,
the compounds were solubilized in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fisher Scientific) and assayed as a 10-point 2-fold
serial dilution series. Bacterial growth was measured by OD590 after incubation at 37 °C for 5 days. MIC was defined as the
minimum concentration required for the complete inhibition of growth.
MIC99 was determined on a solid medium using the serial
proportion method.40 MIC99 was
defined as the minimum concentration required for the prevention of
99% growth.

Kill Kinetics
For kill kinetics
during replicating
conditions, a late log phase culture of M. tuberculosis was adjusted to OD590 = 0.1 in 7H9-Tw-OADC; 50 μL
was used to inoculate 5 mL of 7H9-Tw-OADC containing compounds (final
DMSO concentration of 2%). The cultures were incubated standing at
37 °C, and the serial dilutions were plated to determine CFUs
after 4 weeks incubation at 37 °C.

Construction of sodC and icl1 Overexpression Strains
Gateway compatible entry plasmids
bearing the sodC and icl1 genes
were obtained from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center
and cloned into the pDTCF expression vector41 via an LR Clonase reaction (Life Technologies). This expression
vector contains an anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter and appends
a C-terminal FLAG tag on the protein. The plasmids were electroporated
into M. tuberculosis,(42) and the transformants were selected on plates containing
hygromycin B.

ROS Measurement
A mid-log-phase
culture of M. tuberculosis was adjusted
to OD590 =
0.5, harvested and washed with 7H9-Tw (no OADC), and resuspended in
7H9-Tw containing 40 μM DCFDA. Bacteria were incubated at 37
°C for 30 min, harvested, washed, and resuspended in 7H9-Tw.
DCFDA-loaded cells were added to black-walled clear-bottom 96-well
plates (Greiner) containing a 10-point 2-fold dilution series of compounds.
DMSO was used as a vehicle control. Fluorescence (Ex485/Em535) was
measured using a Biotek Synergy H4 microplate reader; background fluorescence
measured in the untreated DCFDA-loaded M. tuberculosis was subtracted. Each experiment was performed three times. To measure
ROS over extended time periods, M. tuberculosis was grown in the presence of econazole, the cells were loaded with
DCFDA and fluorescence measured.

Metabolomics
M. tuberculosis and an econazole-resistant mutant
(LP-0105935-RM5)13 were grown under aerobic
conditions in roller bottles at
100 rpm to an OD590 of 0.4 before the addition of econazole
or DMSO. Bacteria were harvested and delipidated with chloroform–methanol
after 24 h of incubation. Metabolomic and statistical analyses of
samples was conducted at Metabolon, Inc. as previously described.43,44 Briefly, the delipidated M. tuberculosis samples (N = 6/group) were subjected to methanol
extraction. The extracts were split into aliquots and processed for
analysis using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC/MS) in the positive- or negative-ion mode and using gas chromatography/MS
(GC/MS). For LC/MS, the platform was based on a Waters Acquity ultraperformance
liquid chromatography and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer,
which consisted of an electrospray ionization source and a linear
ion-trap mass analyzer. The sample extract was split into two aliquots,
dried, and then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents;
each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations.
One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive-ion optimized conditions
and the other using basic negative-ion optimized conditions in two
independent injections using separate-dedicated columns. The extracts
reconstituted under acidic conditions were gradient eluted using water
and methanol both containing 0.1% formic acid, whereas the basic extracts,
which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate.
The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion. For GC/MS, the samples were redried
under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 24 h before being derivatized
under dried nitrogen using BSTFA. The GC column was 5% phenyl, and
the temperature ramp is from 40 to 300 °C in a 16 min period.
The samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning
single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization.

Proprietary software was used to match ions to an in-house library
of standards for metabolite identification and for metabolite quantitation
by peak area.45 For statistical analysis
and data visualization, any missing values were assumed to be below
the limits of detection. To determine the statistical significance,
Welch’s two sample t-tests and two-way analysis
of variance were used to compare the means of two populations. P values ≤0.05 were considered highly significant,
and P values between 0.05 and 0.1 were considered
less significant. An estimate of the false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple
comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with Q < 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in
a result.
