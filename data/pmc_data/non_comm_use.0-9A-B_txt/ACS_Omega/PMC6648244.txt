π-Conjugated molecule-bridged
silicon quantum dot (Si QD)
clusters were first synthesized by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction
between 4-ethynylstyryl and octyl co-capped Si QDs (4-Es/Oct Si QDs)
and 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene. The formation of Si QD clusters
was confirmed by field emission transmission electron microscopy.
The electronic coupling between the QDs in the Si QD cluster is significantly
enhanced as compared with that for 4-Es/Oct Si QDs, which is verified
from the red shift in ultraviolet–visible absorption and photoluminescence
spectra of the Si QD cluster with the possibility of exciton transport,
the increased charging effect found in the core-level photoemission
spectra, the shift to lower binding energy of the valence band photoemission
spectrum, and more decisively, the increase in electrical conductance
of the Si QD cluster thin film. To investigate the physical origin
of the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance, we have
merged the microscopic viewpoint, Marcus theory, on the electron transfer
(W) between the adjacent QDs, with macroscopic concepts,
such as the conductance (G), mobility (μ),
and diffusion coefficient (D). The effective reorganizational
energies of charge transfer between the neighboring Si QDs in 4-Es/Oct
Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films are estimated to be 170 and 140
meV, respectively, while the ratio of the effective electronic coupling
of the latter to that of the former is determined to be 7.3:1.

Introduction
The size-dependent
electronic and optical properties of semiconductor
quantum dots (QDs) give them great potential for thin-film optoelectronics
applications, such as light-emitting diodes,1,2 solar
cells,3−6 photodetectors,7,8 and optoelectronic synaptic devices.9,10 Because most device applications of semiconductor QDs are not based
on isolated QDs but on the assembly of QDs, understanding the optoelectrical
properties of the assembly of QDs is necessary to improve device performance.
It is known that the optoelectrical properties of QD molecular or
solid-like assembly are influenced by interdot interactions.11−13 In addition, Koole et al have investigated the interaction of homonuclear
CdTe QD molecules and have indicated wave function overlap in QD molecules,14 where the signature of electronic coupling has
been reported for colloidal QD molecules with organic interconnections.
Recently, our group has reported that the thermal cross-linking of
4-ethynylstyryl capping groups at curing temperatures of 250 and 350
°C to generate π-conjugated molecule linkage between two
neighboring silicon QDs (Si QDs) decreases the width and height of
the energy barrier between neighboring QDs, which allows the expansion
of the wave functions of individual Si QDs and more resonant interaction
with the neighboring QDs.15 We have also
reported that the revelation of electronic coupling between the Si
QDs in QD solids induces significant changes in the valence band photoemission
spectral, optical, and electrical properties.15

Recently, we have initiated research on the Si QD-based functional
materials, aggressively utilizing the phenomena of electronic coupling
observed in our previous study for Si QD solids.15 Under such direction, we have considered that the most
urgent matter is to check whether a π-conjugated molecule bridge
inserted between the Si QDs by the use of a C–C cross-coupling
reaction provides the possibility of controlling the electronic coupling.
If this is revealed, the diversity of C–C cross-coupling reactions
is sure to open huge opportunity for developing novel Si QD functional
materials—appropriately responding to the material property
requirements of the various applications. In this study, we focus
the investigation on electronic coupling in π-conjugated molecule-bridged
Si QD clusters (Si QDs each covalently connected to one another by
π-conjugated molecule bridges). The first synthesis of the Si
QD clusters has been attempted by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction
between 4-ethynylstyryl and octyl co-capped (4-Es/Oct) Si QDs and
2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene, as shown in Scheme 1a, after the previous syntheses of π-conjugated
soluble poly(aryleneethynylene) (PAE)-type polymers were referenced.16 Field emission transmission electron microscopy
(FE-TEM) of 4-Es/Oct Si QDs shows the image of an isolated particle
with an average diameter of (5.4 ± 0.6) nm, whereas that of the
Si QD clusters shows the image of mixtures of a dimer, trimer, tetramer,
pentamer, and nonamer. The effect of C–C cross-coupling on
the optical properties of Si QDs is investigated by ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.
The valence-band photoemission spectrum of the Si QD cluster thin
film is obtained by high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy with
the photon energy at 130 eV, which is compared with that for a 4-Es/Oct
Si QD thin film. The results demonstrate remarkably increased electronic
coupling in the π-conjugated molecule-bridged Si QD clusters.
In addition, the temperature dependences of the current–voltage
(I–V) curves for the Si QD
cluster and 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin films are compared and analyzed in
terms of the microscopic model of electron transfer between adjacent
Si QDs, based on Marcus theory.

Purification Process of Si QD Clusters
Results and Discussion
π-Conjugated molecule-bridged
Si QD clusters were first synthesized
by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between 4-Es/Oct Si QDs and
2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene, as shown in Scheme 1a,b, where adjacent Si QDs are covalently
connected with considerably short linkages of vinylenephenyleneethynylene-(3-hexyl)thiophene-ethynylenephenylenevinylene
(VPE-T-EPV). On the basis of the detailed explanations in the Experimental Section on the purification process
(Scheme 1b) and TEM
results (Figure 1)
and the discussions in the Supporting Information on the H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data (Figure S2a,b of
the Supporting Information) and the UV–vis
absorption spectra (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information) of P.1 and P.2, we conclude that P.2 is the main product
containing Si QDs and P.1 is a byproduct of high fraction
of a very long π-conjugated polymer chain. The dominant product
in the P.2 is Si QD cluster (A) containing
the considerably short VPE-T-EPV linkage. This is because its TEM
image shows the distance between the QDs to be smaller than 2.5 nm
(Figure 1b–d),
implying no additional involvement of 1,4-diethynylbenzene molecules,
which remained not completely consumed in the previous hydrosilylation
reaction step. We name the main product of Si QD (P.2) as “Si QD cluster”, by considering the morphology
of the cluster, confirmed by the following TEM results.

(b) Si QD clusters. (c) Count distribution of the QD mono, dimer,
trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and nonamer. (d) TEM image and optimized
geometry of the Si QD dimer.

Figure 1 shows
the
transmission scanning electron microscopy images of 4-Es/Oct Si QD
and Si QD clusters (A; P.2). First, the
TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
of 4-Es/Oct Si QD clearly show highly spherical dots, diamond structure,
and isolated QDs with average sizes of (5.4 ± 0.6) nm (Figure 1a), whereas the TEM
images of the Si QD cluster show aggregated QDs, in other words, a
QD cluster (Figure 1b). Second, multiple TEM images (Figure 1b) reveal that the Si QD clusters are a mixture
of monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and nonamer Si QDs,
in which the monomer, dimer, and trimer are the main clusters with
the count fractions of 34, 32, and 20% (Figure 1c), respectively. Finally, in the Si QD dimer,
which is one of the clusters, the interparticle distance between two
Si QDs (23 Å) obtained from the TEM images of the Si QD clusters
is quite similar to the length (24.1 Å) of the π-conjugated
molecule bridge originated from one thiophene ring and two ethynylenephenylenevinylene
fragments directly anchored on two Si QDs, which is estimated from
the geometry optimized in density function theory (DFT) calculations
(Figure 1d). This implies
that the synthesis of the Si QD cluster (A; P.2), our main product, is not involved with free diethynylbenzene molecules
which remained, not completely consumed in the previous hydrosilylation
reaction step. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) results (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information) indicate that 4-Es/Oct Si QD and 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene are
C–C cross-coupled together in the Si QD cluster (A; P.2). This is very reasonable because most of the
Si QD clusters (B, B′) additionally
associated with free diethynylbenzene molecules in the Sonogashira
cross-coupling reaction were discarded in the purification process.

The optical properties of the Si QD cluster compared to 4-Es/Oct
Si QD were characterized by UV–vis absorption and PL emission
spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of the 4-Es/Oct Si QD
and Si QD cluster in chloroform. The new, broad peak around 340 nm
is attributed to the change of the electronic structure of the Si
QD upon clustering. Concretely, it is surely generated from the extension
of the conjugation length with the thiophene ring and adjacent Si
QDs after the C–C cross-coupling reaction. This is related
to the reduction in the optical gap of Si QDs due to electronic coupling
between the adjacent Si QDs. On the other hand, an absorption peak
for the thiophene ring was rarely observed for our Si QD clusters,
unlike that a very broad, strong absorption peak at 390 nm (Figure S3) was observed for PAE containing a
thiophene ring or the absorption peak of polythiophene at 443.6 nm
was reported in a previous study.17 This
means that light absorption due to the thiophene ring in our Si QD
clusters is greatly suppressed. This is due to the relatively small
cross section of the thiophene ring for the light absorption process,
as compared to a huge volume of Si QDs.

(−C=C–Ph–C≡C−) linkage,

to 567 nm. (d) Representation of exciton transport through the conducting
channel in the band structure built in three regions [Si QD–vinylenephenyleneethynylene

A similar trend was also observed
on comparing their PL spectra
obtained under an excitation wavelength at 380 nm (Figure 2a). While an emission peak
was observed at 490 nm for 4-Es/Oct Si QD, a very broad emission peak
is observed at 540 nm for Si QD clusters. The emission peak wavelength
of 490 nm for a 4-Es/Oct Si QD of 5.4 nm is significantly smaller,
even if the difference in capping groups is considered, as compared
with 750 nm for a 5.8 nm Si QD and 770 nm for a 5 nm Si QD of high
quality reported in previous studies.18,19 This is because
the Si QD synthesized by our group is still in part oxidized, which
has been mentioned in detail in our previous paper.15 Although there may be a little issue in the quality of
the Si QD, we think that it is possible to focus on the effect of
clustering on the optical and electrical properties of the Si QD and
the related physical chemistry. The broad peak at 540 nm could be
divided into three components at 490, 520, and 567 nm, as shown in Figure 2b. The emission component
at 490 nm is originated from the monomer of 4-Es/Oct Si QD itself
that still exists in the Si QD cluster solution. The existence of
the monomer was confirmed in the above TEM investigation. The emission
component at 530 nm is ascribed to the Si QD itself in the Si QD clusters,
such as the dimer, trimer, and so on. The red shift from 490 to 530
nm is due to the extension of the conjugation length with the thiophene
ring and adjacent Si QDs, which is well-consistent with the above
absorption result. This is related to the reduction in the optical
gap of Si QDs due to electronic coupling between the adjacent Si QDs.
The emission component of 567 nm is attributed to the thiophene ring
when considering very large similarity with the PL emission peak at
573 nm of polythiophene and its asymmetric tail of more than 700 nm.17

It is very interesting that in the Si
QD cluster solution, its
PL due to the thiophene ring is present, although its absorption feature
is not observed. We tentatively suggest the possibility of exciton
transport from the Si QD to the thiophene ring through the vinylenephenyleneethynylene
(−C=C–Ph–C≡C−) linkage because
this can be indirect evidence of electron coupling through the conjugated
molecule bridge between Si QDs. As shown in Figure 2c,d, excitation at 380 nm on Si QD clusters
generates an electron–hole pair (i.e., exciton) in the Si QD.
The electron and hole in excitons, in part, will fall down into lower
energy levels through electronic and vibrational relaxations in the
Si QD. They then recombine to emit a photon near 530 nm in the Si
QD. The other parts of excitons can transport to the thiophene ring
through the vinylenephenyleneethynylene linkage and their electron
and hole can recombine to emit a photon near 567 nm after some electronic
and vibrational relaxation mechanisms are generated in the aromatic
molecular structure. The exciton migration from the Si QD to the ligand
molecules has been studied in both experimental and theoretical works
on Si QDs.20,21 The exciton transport through
ethynylenephenyleneethynylene (−C≡C–Ph–C≡C−)
linkage, very similar to our vinylenephenyleneethynylene linkage in
terms of high degree of π-conjugation, has been well-known in
fluorescence studies of poly(p-phenylenethynylene)s
(PPEs),22,23 where the exciton diffusion length of PPE
was found to be ca. 140 (Ph–C≡C−) units. When
considering this large exciton diffusion length in the ethynylenephenyleneethynylene
(−C≡C–Ph–C≡C−) linkage system,
we can never deny the possibility of fast exciton transport from the
Si QD to the thiophene ring through vinylenephenyleneethynylene (−C=C–Ph–C≡C−)
linkage of a very short transport pathway. This exciton transport
is possible by the formation of conducting channels, that is, conduction
and valence bands, upon QD clustering with π-conjugated molecule
linkages. In view of quantum mechanics, this is very relevant to the
enhancement of electronic coupling between adjacent Si QDs due to
π-conjugated molecule linkage. This is further supported with
following photoemission spectroscopy and temperature dependence of
electrical conductivity.

4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin
films were fabricated by
conventional spin-coating and a curing process at 150 °C for
4 h under argon. After being filtered through 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) membranes, 2 wt % solutions in toluene for 4-Es/Oct Si QD and
the Si QD cluster were poured onto Si wafer substrates, followed by
spinning at 500 rpm for 5 s and subsequently at 2500 rpm for 25 s.
The thin films on the Si wafers were then cured at 150 °C for
4 h under argon in a tube vacuum furnace. Figure 3a shows that the thicknesses of films were
found to be 70 and 60 nm, respectively, from the vertical cross-sectional
images in secondary electron microscopy.

images of 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster
thin films. (b) MIM device structure.

High-resolution photoemission spectroscopy was performed
to investigate
the chemical environment of the silicon element and the valence band
edge position of 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films. Figures 4 and S5a–c
of the Supporting Information show the
binding energies (BEs) of the Si 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and S 2p peaks. As
for the C 1s spectra (Figure S5a of the Supporting Information) at the photon energy of 630 eV, charge calibration
in data analysis is not performed to directly show the different extent
of charging for the two thin films, while the other peaks are calibrated
by positioning the C 1s peaks at 285.0 eV. The BEs of the C 1s peak
for 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin-films are 288.2 and 286.2
eV, respectively. This indicates that both films experience charging
phenomena upon photon irradiation. The lower charging effect in the
Si QD cluster thin film, as compared to that in the 4-Es/Oct Si QD
thin film, implies that the electrical conductivity of the former
is larger than that of the latter. This is thought to be related to
more significant electronic coupling for the Si QD cluster, which
was suggested in the above UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy and
PL spectroscopy analyses.

the photon energy
of 630 eV of 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films cured at
150 °C. (b) Si 2p core-level photoemission spectra at a photon
energy of 130 eV of 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films cured
at 150 °C. (c) Valence band photoemission spectra at a photon
energy of 130 eV of 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films cured
at 150 °C. Here, for the photon energy of 630 eV, the Si 2p spectrum
was charge-calibrated by setting the C 1s peak to 285.0 eV. For the
photon energy of 130 eV, the Si 2p and valence band spectra were calibrated
by positioning SiO2 peaks at corresponding ones for the
photon energy of 630 eV.

To go into more quantitative details of the surface Si QD,
we considered
the fitting of high-resolution Si 2p core-level spectra of Si QD clusters
and 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin films cured at 150 °C using photon energies
of 630 and 130 eV (Figure 4a,b) by Voigt functions. Here, the BE of Si 2p for the photon
energy of 630 eV was calibrated by positioning the C 1s peak at 285.0
eV, whereas that for the photon energy of 130 eV was calibrated by
positioning SiO2 peaks at the corresponding ones for the
photon energy of 630 eV. The results display chemical components of
the Si core and Si QD surface with BEs at 99.5 [silicon core (Si0)], 102.2 eV [suboxidized (SiCOx) or functionalized (Si–C)], and 103.7 eV [full oxidized (SiO2)],24,25 respectively. The high-resolution
spectrum of the Si 2p core level of the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film shows
the additional peak appeared at higher BE of 105 eV even after the
charge-calibration process, as compared with Si QD clusters, which
indicates the possibility of existence of highly insulating domains.
This is well-consistent with different charging in the C 1s peaks,
as mentioned above, and the additional O 1s peak of higher BE for
the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film (Figure S5b of the Supporting Information). The charging effect in photoelectron
spectroscopy is usually found in insulating materials. In our studies,
then, the smaller charging effect for the Si QD cluster thin film,
as compared with the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film, can be explained by
more distinctive origin, that is, the increase in its electrical conductivity,
which will be explained in more detail below in the current–voltage
(I–V) measurements. In the
Si QD cluster thin film, a particular Si QD to undergo the photoelectric
effect has on average more probability to be covalently bonded to
another Si QD, which can transfer the electrons to the particular
Si QD and recover its neutral state, finally giving rise to a decrease
in the charging effect. The enhanced microscopic QD connectivity in
the Si QD cluster results in its increased electrical conductivity,
which is explained by the increase in electronic coupling between
Si QDs.

The valence band spectra of the Si QD cluster and 4-Es/Oct
Si QD
thin films cured at 150 °C were recorded at photon energies of
130 eV (Figure 4c).
The valence band spectra of Si QD cluster thin films shift to a lower
BE of 4.1 eV, as compared with 5.0 eV of 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin films.
The lower BE means the increase in the energy of occupied valence
orbitals of the valence band, which gives rise to the reduction of
the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital gap or band gap. Recently, Koole et al proposed that the electronic
coupling of the band edge orbitals from neighboring CdTe QD molecules
is responsible for the observed reduction of the band gap.14 Then, we consider that the lower BE of 4.1 eV
in the valence band spectra of the Si QD cluster thin films also originated
from the enhanced electronic coupling. This is in good agreement with
the above arguments that the red shift in the UV–vis absorbance
spectra and PL spectra of Si QD clusters is ascribed to the reduction
in the optical band gap due to significant electronic coupling between
the neighboring Si QDs.

Recently, we have reported in our previous
studies for Si QD solids
that the electronic coupling-invoked thermal cross-linking has an
effect on not only their optical properties but also their electrical
properties.15 Thus, for more in-depth understanding
of the effect of electronic coupling on the electrical properties
of the Si QD cluster thin films, we investigated the electron transport
of the Si QD cluster thin films compared to that of the 4-Es/Oct Si
QD thin film using a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) device
(Figure 3b), as shown
in the current–voltage (I–V) measurements and analyses of Figure 5. To make an efficient interpretation for the temperature
dependence of the I–V data,
we introduce the microscopic theoretical framework, Marcus theory,
on the electron transfer between the adjacent QDs and explain how
to merge it with macroscopic concepts, such as conductance (G), mobility (μ), and diffusion coefficient (D). Then, we build up a very useful simple equation, where
the natural log of G is expressed as a function of
the reciprocal of the absolute measurement temperature, allowing the
investigation of microscopic phenomena, such as comparison of the
electronic coupling and activation energy (or reorganization energy)
for the 4-Es/Oct Si QDs and Si QD cluster thin films.

ln G – 3/2 ln(1/T) as a function

QDs in 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films.

Chen et al. suggested that the carrier transport
mechanism in thin
films of alkyl ligand-terminated Si QDs corresponds to nearest-neighbor
hopping (NNH) throughout the measured interval of temperature.26 The carrier transport via the NNH was also reported
in a benzonitrile-treated Si nanocrystal (NC) thin film.9 Then, the charge transport mechanism in 4-Es/Oct
Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films is assumed to be the NNH mechanism.
In addition, the hopping transport of QD thin films is described by
Marcus theory.27−29 Within Marcus theory, the charge transfer rate (W) between neighboring two Si QDs is given by the following
equation27 1  where, V is the electronic
coupling between QDs, λ is the reorganization energy, ΔG0 is the free-energy difference between the
two electronic origins, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, and T is the temperature, as depicted in
a model for the energetics of the electron transfer reaction in Scheme 2a. The relationship
between the reorganization energy (λ) and activation energy
(Ea) is defined as 2

and Randomness; (c) In the Si QD Cluster Thin Film, hcp or ccp Crystal
Structure with the Average Interdot Distance (rcluster*) and Corresponding
Interdot Electron Transfer Rate (Wcluster*) Is Assumed, Considering
All Structural Variations and Randomness
For a charge hopping process in the Si QD cluster and
4-Es/Oct
Si QD thin films, the donor and the acceptor are the same kind of
Si QD. Then, if we ignore the small difference of electronic energy
due to QD size variation, the free-energy difference approximates
zero (ΔG0 ≈ 0). The organization
energy (λ) is obtained as 3  

Substituting eq 3 into eq 1, we obtain the charge
transfer rate (W) between neighboring two Si QDs
in the hopping transport of Si QD thin films, such as 4  

We then need to make the mathematical relationship
between the
conductance (G) in our MIM device and the electron
transfer rate (W) between the adjacent Si QDs in
the sandwiched thin film. As a first step, we use the following relationship
between the conductance (G) and the electron diffusion
coefficient (D) with cross-sectional area (A), thickness (l) of the thin film, and
elementary charge (e), whose derivation is explained
in detail in the Supporting Information 5  

The key route to relate G to the microscopic,
Marcus-type electron transfer rate (W) between the
neighboring Si QDs is the adoption of the NNH model used in organic
semiconductors,30,31 where D is proportional
to W. 6  Here, d = 3 is the dimensionality
for our three-dimensional system. As shown in Scheme 2b, we build up a closest-packed layer of
QDs, where there are 6 nearest neighbors in a single layer, but a
total of 12 nearest neighbors including the above 3 neighbors and
the below 3 neighbors, mimicking the hexagonal closed-packed (hcp)
structure or the cubic close-packed (ccp) structure in inorganic chemistry.32 As shown in Scheme 2b, the index i covers all
the hopping pathways out of a particular Si QD with ri being the corresponding hopping distance,
which is usually expressed as the interdot center-to-center distance
and Wi being the electron
transfer rate. Pi is
the relative probability to choose the ith pathway 7  

We tentatively assume,
for 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin films, that all ri and Wi can be represented by rmono* and Wmono*, respectively. Then, this
is very reasonable if we imagine the closest-packed
QD lattice of Scheme 2b. Then, the diffusion coefficient Dmono can be computed simply from the representative interdot center-to-center
distance rmono* and interdot electron transfer rate Wmono* 8  

As shown in Scheme 2c, we also build up a closest-packed layer
of QDs for Si QD cluster
thin films. Here, owing to the diversity of the kinds of cluster (with
different numbers of Si QD), there are large structural variations
deviating from the standard closest packing, though, we also assume,
for Si QD cluster thin films that all ri and Wi can be represented, in an average sense, with rcluster* and Wcluster*, respectively. This assumption is unavoidable to make the
following quantitative arguments. However, because the rcluster* and Wcluster* values are effective, representative ones to consider all
structural variations, and even for Si QD cluster thin films, there
is a closest-packed QD solid with very short molecular bridges, we
can utilize the representative values for comparison in the following
discussion. 9  

After inserting eqs 8 and 9 into eq 5 and using eq 4, as explained in very detail in
the Supporting Information, we can obtain the simple equation, where the natural
log of G is expressed as a function of the reciprocal
of absolute temperature with the electronic coupling (Vmono for the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film, Vcluster for the Si QD cluster thin film), activation energy
(Ea,mono for the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film, Ea,cluster for the Si QD cluster thin film),
and an appropriate constant B. 10a   10b   11a   11b  

The activation energies
of the Si QD cluster and 4-Es/Oct Si QD
thin films are obtained by measuring the temperature dependence of
conductance. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the Si QD cluster and 4-Es/Oct Si
QD thin films were recorded in a probe station in a nitrogen-filled
chamber at different temperatures in the range from 133 to 293 K using
an HP4145B semiconductor parameter analyzer. The current–voltage
(I–V) curves in the low-bias
regime of (−100 to 100) mV for 4-Es/Oct Si QD (Figure 5a) and Si QD cluster thin films
are obtained (Figure 5b) at different temperatures from 133 to 293 K. During these measurements,
the thin films were placed in the dark and under vacuum at a pressure
of 10–3 Torr. The values of activation energy (Ea,mono, Ea,cluster) and (Bmono, Bcluster) are obtained by measuring the slope of the natural
log plot of the electrical conductances (G) at several
points, as shown in Figure 5c,d. Figure 5c shows two different slopes, one in the range from 133 to 193 K
and the other in the range from 213 to 293 K. In addition, Figure 5d shows different
slopes, one in the range from 133 to 193 K and the other in the range
from 213 to 293 K. Here, we take the graphs and their slopes of the
higher temperature range for the following two reasons. The first
reason is that in the high-temperature range, the NNH process exactly
matching with our Marcus-type charge transfer is favored, whereas
in the lower temperature range, a variable range hopping process is
preferred.33,34 The second reason is that eq 1 on the charge transfer
rate in the classical Marcus theory has been quantum mechanically
formulated in the higher temperature range,35−37 for example,
the equation is well-applied for explaining carrier mobility at room
temperature in organic semiconductor thin films.31,38 From the slope of the higher temperature plot, we can obtain the
activation energy value Ea,mono = 42 meV
for the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film, which is larger than the activation
energy value Ea,cluster = 34 meV for the
Si QD cluster thin film (Figure 5c–e). In other words, the reorganization energy
for 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films is calculated to be
170 and 140 meV, respectively, using eq 3. The reorganization values could be of those for hole
or electron transfer, even though in our study the carrier is temporarily
assigned to an electron, for simplicity in building up the theoretical
formalism. These reorganization energy values are compared to those
calculated for the Si QD using ab initio calculations.27 The reorganization energies of Si35H36 QD (fully passivated), Si35H35DB QD (dangling bond), and Si35H34O (doubly
bonded oxygen defect) for hole transfer were calculated to be 270,
830, and 390 meV, respectively, whereas those for electron transfer
were 170, 1170, and 850 meV, respectively.27 In addition, the larger molecule tends to give smaller reorganization
energy, as confirmed in a study on hopping transport in conductive
heterocyclic oligomers.39 Then, the smaller
reorganization energies in our Si QD system, as compared with the
referenced Si QDs whose number of silicon are 35, are surely due to
the larger QD diameter (5.4 nm for our synthesized Si QDs vs ca. 1
nm for Si35H36 QD, Si35H35DB QD, and Si35H34O).

From the activation
energies and Bmono (=–6.3), Bcluster (=–2.2)
values of the Si QD cluster and 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin films (Figure 5c–e), we obtain
the electronic coupling ratio between the Si QD cluster (Vcluster) and 4-Es/Oct Si QD (Vmono) thin films using eqs 10b and 11b 12   13  

On the other hand, we can obtain eq 14 from eqs 10a and 11a and substitute the conductance
values at 293 K, electronic coupling, and activation energy values
into the equation 14   15  

Equations 14 and 15 show that the increase in conductance of the Si
QD cluster thin film compared with that of the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin
film is almost exclusively due to the enhanced electronic coupling
rather than the thermal factor.

Here, it is very necessary to
keep in mind that the electronic
coupling and reorganization energy for charge transfer in 4-Es/Oct
Si QD and Si QD cluster thin films are contributed by those for all
hopping pathways under all structural variations and randomness schematically
depicted in Scheme 2b,c. In other words, the above values for our Si QD systems are not
determined from a particular hopping pathway but just act as representative
ones to effectively consider all hopping pathways, as confirmed by
the derivation of eqs 8 and 9 with defining rmono*, Wmono*, rcluster*, and Wcluster*. This is why we can tentatively call
them the “effective” coupling and “effective”
reorganization energy, respectively. Their effectiveness and representability
are more necessary for the Si QD cluster thin film, as compared with
the 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin film. This is because, as shown in Scheme 2b,c, the structural
variation of the nearest QDs around a Si QD with an electron (or a
hole) is much more serious for the Si QD cluster thin film. In our
previous study, we provided a unique Si QD thin film where all Si
QDs are connected covalently through a π molecular bridge by
thermal cross-linking.15 The dramatic increase
by 4 orders of magnitude in current density observed for the cross-linked
Si QD thin film, surely giving rise to huge increases in conductance
values as compared to those of 4-Es/Oct Si QD thin films, is due to
the approximately single chemical environment around Si QDs experiencing
strong electronic coupling through the π-molecular bridge. To
confirm the possibility of huge electronic coupling in the thermal
cross-linked Si QD thin film of complete π-molecule interconnection,
the investigation of its temperature dependence will be again performed
under the theoretical framework—merge of the microscopic viewpoint,
Marcus theory, with the electron transfer (W) between
the adjacent QDs with macroscopic property, such as the electrical
conductance (G), introduced in this study. In addition,
we want to mention that the physical origin of the higher conductivity
of our Si QD cluster thin film is distinctively different from that
for phenylpropyl ligand-terminated Si QDs2—the former is originated from the enhanced electronic coupling
through the π-molecular bridge and the latter is due to the
benzene ring-induced π–π stacking in phenylpropyl
ligands of adjacent Si QDs.

The electrical conductivity of our
Si QD cluster thin film is calculated
to 1.7 × 10–9 S cm–1, which
is very poor compared to that of a typical organic semiconductor [undoped
poly(3-hexylthiophene): ca. 2 × 10–4 S cm–1].40 The reason for such
poor conductivity of the Si QD cluster thin film is that there are
a lot of interfaces of no molecular bridge because there are still
a lot of monomers of 4-Es/Oct Si QDs, although dimers and trimers
are dominant clusters. This means that in our Si QD cluster thin film,
electronic coupling between Si QD clusters (not between Si QDs) would
be relatively very small compared to that between polymer chains in
an organic semiconductor. On the other hand, for the Si QD thin film
cured at 350 °C in our previous study,15 the completely π-molecule-bridged QD network over the entire
thin film exhibited 4 orders of magnitude higher conductivity compared
to that of Si QD solids of no π-molecular bridges. Thus, we
now believe that chemical control at interfaces between Si QD clusters
is crucial to further increase the electrical conductivity of the
Si QD cluster thin film in the future.

Conclusions
In
this article, for the first time, we synthesized a π-conjugated
molecule-bridged Si QD cluster by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction,
which is sure to open huge opportunity for developing novel functional
materials owing to the diversity of C–C cross-coupling reactions
and bridged molecular structures. The enhanced electronic coupling
through the π-conjugated molecule bridge in the Si QD cluster
was verified by the red shifts in UV–vis absorption and PL
emission with the possibility of exciton transport, the increased
charging effect found in the core-level photoemission spectra, the
shift to lower BE of the valence band photoemission spectrum, and
the increase in electrical conductance of its thin film. For the first
time, in the field of QD solids, we developed a theoretical framework
which merges the microscopic viewpoint, Marcus theory, on the electron
transfer (W) between the adjacent QDs, with macroscopic
concepts, such as the conductance (G), mobility (μ),
and diffusion coefficient (D), to investigate the
physical origin of the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance
of a Si QD cluster thin film. We also, for the first time, demonstrated
that, in the Si QD thin film, its electrical conductance is almost
exclusively governed by electronic coupling rather than the thermal
factor.

Synthesis of Si QD Clusters
Scheme S1a–c of
the Supporting Information summarizes the
synthesis of silica (SiO2) nanoparticles, silicon NCs embedded
in silicon oxide phase (Si NCs@SiO2), and 4-Es/Oct Si QD.
Especially, the synthesis of the 4-Es/Oct Si QD was performed in the
same way we had used in our previous paper.15 The Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction has been employed in organic
synthesis to form carbon–carbon bonds between a terminal alkyne
(RC≡C–H) and aryl or vinyl halide (R′–X).16,41 Thus, to connect isolated 4-Es/Oct Si QD by π-conjugated molecule
linkers, we performed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, as shown
in Scheme 1a. The C–C
coupling reaction between 4-Es/Oct Si QD and 2,5-dibromo-3-hexyl-thiophene
was carried out in the argon atmosphere by using the standard Schlenk
line technique. The 4-Es/Oct Si QD (0.1 g), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (20 mg), and CuI (8 mg) were dispersed in a
mixture of anhydrous toluene (6 mL) and TEA (3 mL) and then added
to a 100 mL two neck flask equipped with a condenser that was connected
to a Schlenk line filled with argon. The solution was stirred for
5 min at room temperature. 2,5-Dibromo-3-hexyl-thiophene (0.2 g) and
anhydrous toluene (6 mL) were added to the mixture, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 2.5 h to obtain a brown solution.
After cooling the reaction mixture, methanol (MeOH) was added into
the reaction mixture to precipitate Si QD clusters and then centrifuged
at 15 000 rpm for 5 min to obtain a brown powder. This powder
was washed with MeOH repeatedly (three times) to remove the catalyst.
As mentioned in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) result (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information), the removal of the remaining
capping molecules, 1,4-diethynylbenzene, is not completed because
of the interaction between 4-Es/Oct Si QD and 1,4-diethynylbenzene
through C≡C–H···C≡C hydrogen bonding.42 The 4-Es/Oct Si QDs were obtained as a yellow
powder including the remaining capping molecules, 1,4-diethynylbenzene.
Because of the remaining 1,4-diethethynylbenzene molecule, as shown
in Scheme 1a, the synthesis
of Si QD clusters is performed not only by cross-coupling between
4-Es/Oct Si QD and 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene to generate a molecule
(relatively smaller molecular weight part: A, relatively
larger molecular weight part: A′) but also by
cross-coupling between 4-Es/Oct Si QD, 1,4-diethynylbenzene and 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene
to a generate molecule (relatively smaller molecular weight part: B, relatively larger molecular weight part: B′). Hence, we suggest that the product of the Sonogashira cross-coupling
reaction is a mixture of two kinds of product groups ({A, A′}, {B, B′}) (Scheme 1b). Some
powder products did not completely dissolve in toluene. There are
some soluble parts (A, B) because of relatively
smaller molecular weight and some insoluble parts (A′, B′) because of relatively larger molecular
weight. Hence, the products in toluene solvent were separated by filtering
through 0.2 μm PTFE membranes (Scheme 1b). The remaining solution of A and B was dried by using a rotary evaporator to give
powder product. The powder of the soluble part was further purified
by a precipitation method with toluene as a solvent and methanol as
an antisolvent, in which the Si QD clusters (A) with
considerably short linkage of VPE-T-EPV were precipitated, whereas
the Si QD hybrid polymer of very long chain of (3-hexyl)thiophene-ethynylenephenyleneethynylene
units (B) remained soluble. After centrifugation, the
Si QD clusters (A) were obtained as a yellow powder (P.2), while the soluble hybrid polymer of higher organic fraction
(B) was taken as a solution (P.1). The dominant
product in the P.2 is the Si QD cluster (A) containing the considerably short VPE-T-EPV linkage because its
TEM image shows the distance between the QDs to be smaller than 2.5
nm (Figure 1b–d),
implying no additional involvement of the 1,4-diethynylbenzene molecules,
which remain not completely consumed in the previous hydrosilylation
reaction step.

Thin-Film Fabrications
4-Es/Oct
Si QD and Si QD cluster
thin films were fabricated by a conventional spin-coating method.
After being filtered through 0.2 μm PTFE membranes, 2 wt % solutions
in toluene for 4-Es/Oct Si QD and the Si QD cluster (A; P.2) were poured onto Si wafer substrates, followed
by spinning at 500 rpm for 5 s and subsequently at 2500 rpm for 25
s. The thin films on the Si wafers were then cured at 150 °C
for 4 h under argon in a tube vacuum furnace.

Theoretical Calculations
The optimized geometries of
the π-conjugated molecule bridge (Figure 1d) were obtained using the MP3 semiempirical
method in the HyperChem 8.0 package. The geometries were further optimized
using DFT at B3LYP level and the 6-31G** basis set in Gaussian 16.43

Characterizations
FE-TEM was performed
using a JEM-2100F
electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of
400 kV. For TEM sampling, a solution of 0.05 wt % of 4-Es/Oct Si QD
and Si QD clusters in toluene was drop-cast onto a carbon-coated copper
grid, and the solvent was evaporated in a vacuum. NMR data were collected
on superconducting FT-NMR 300 MHz (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, California,
USA). Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) in a
solvent of chloroform-d (99.8 atom % D). FT-IR measurements
were conducted by a Nicolet 380 spectrometry system (Waltham, MA,
USA) operated in the mid-IR range of (4000–400) cm–1, with spectra obtained at a spectral resolution of 8 cm–1 in transmittance mode. SCINCO S-3150 spectrometry (Scinco Co., Ltd.,
Korea) was used to obtain the UV–vis absorption spectrum of
the 4-Es/Oct Si QD and Si QD cluster solution of 0.01 wt % in chloroform.
iHR320 Hiroba spectrometry (Hiroba, Japan) with 3 nm slit width for
emission monochromators was used to perform PL spectroscopy of 4-Es/Oct
Si QD and Si QD clusters.

Photoemission Spectroscopy
The 4-Es/Oct
Si QD and Si
QD cluster thin films were cured at 150 °C under an Ar atmosphere.
Each sample was introduced into an ultrahigh vacuum chamber and pumped
down to the base pressure reaching 5 × 10–10 Torr. The O 1s, C 1s, S 2p, and Si 2p core-level spectra of the
samples were recorded at the photon energy of 630 eV with a total
resolution of 200 meV at the 8A2 HRPES beam line at the Pohang Accelerator
Laboratory (PAL) equipped with an electron analyzer (Scienta 2002).
As for the C 1s spectra at the photon energy of 630 eV, the charge-calibration
in data analysis is not performed to directly show the different extent
of charging for the two thin films. The BEs of Si 2p, O 1s, and S
2p for the photon energy of 630 eV were calibrated by positioning
the C 1s peaks at 285.0 eV. Valence-band spectra were recorded at
the photon energy of 130 eV. Si 2p core-level spectra were also measured
at the photon energy of 130 eV. As for the photon energy of 130 eV,
all spectra were calibrated by positioning SiO2 peaks at
the corresponding ones for the photon energy of 630 eV. All spectra
were obtained in the normal emission mode. The O 1s, C 1s, and Si
2p photoemission spectra were fitted by using a standard nonlinear
least-squares fitting procedure with Voigt functions.

Electrical
Property Measurement of Thin Films
MIM device
structures of Al electrode–thin film–p++ Si
wafer (resistivity <0.005 Ω cm) were fabricated to investigate
the temperature dependence of conductance for the 4-Es/Oct Si QD and
Si QD cluster thin films, which were cured at 150 °C under an
Ar atmosphere. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were obtained in a probe station in a
nitrogen-filled chamber at different temperatures in the range from
133 to 293 K using an HP4145B semiconductor parameter analyzer. The
current passing through the film was measured while the applied voltage
was swept from −100 to 100 mV. All measurements were carried
out in the dark and under vacuum at a pressure of 10–3 Torr.
