Starting from indolylmaleimide,
concise and efficient total synthesis
of (±)-epi-subincanadine C was described via
stereoselective Wittig olefination, base-induced selective mono-prenylation,
regioselective Grignard reaction, diastereoselective Pictet–Spengler
cyclization, regioselective oxidative carbon–carbon double-bond
cleavage, one-pot reductions, and intramolecular cyclization pathway.

Introduction
The structurally novel
and medicinally important cytotoxic alkaloids
subincanadines A–G were isolated in 2002 by Ohsaki and co-workers
from the Brazilian medicinal plant Aspidosperma subincanum (Figure 1).1,2 Zhai and co-workers reported the first protection-free synthesis
of (±)-subincanadine C via novel Ni(COD)2-mediated
intramolecular Michael addition pathway.3 Elegant enantioselective/diastereoselective synthetic routes to
other subincanadines A, B, E, and F have been reported in the contemporary
literature.4−13 However, synthesis of subincanadines D and G is still awaited. We
initially prepared a plan for the synthesis of (±)-epi-subincanadine C and (±)-subincanadine C, and their concise
retrosynthetic analysis is depicted in Scheme 1. 1-[2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (1) contains well-positioned
14 carbons and requisite functional groups for the initial design
of 14-carbon-containing tetracyclic indolizinoindolone framework and
then its transformation into the bridged alkaloid (±)-subincanadine
C. Therefore, we reasoned that the maleimide derivative 1 would be a potential precursor to synthesize both (±)-epi-subincanadine C and (±)-subincanadine C via diastereoselective
Pictet–Spengler cyclization and diastereoselective cuprate
addition or reduction of carbon–carbon double bond as the key
reactions. In continuation of our studies on total synthesis of bioactive
natural products from the cyclic anhydride and derivatives,14−18 we herein report the diastereoselective synthesis of (±)-epi-subincanadine C and an attempted synthesis of (±)-subincanadine
C (Schemes 1–4).

(±)-epi-Subincanadine
C and (±)-Subincanadine C
Results and Discussion
Initially, Wittig reaction of
imide 1 with acetaldehyde
was planned for the stereoselective generation of desired exocyclic
carbon–carbon double bond, activation of methylene group in
the formed imide moiety for base-induced alkylation/allylation, and
differentiation of the reactivities of two imide carbonyls to impart
complete regioselectivity. Indolylmaleimide 1 on triphenylphosphine-induced
Wittig reaction with acetaldehyde exclusively delivered alkylidenesuccinimide 2 in 92% yield19,20 (Scheme 2). The E-geometry of carbon–carbon
double bond in product 2 was established on the basis
of deshielding of a vinylic proton (δ 6.88) due to its peri-interaction
with an imide carbonyl group. As described in Scheme 3, all attempts on lithium di-isopropyl amide
(LDA)/LiHMDS-induced alkylation of compound 3 using various
alkylating agents to directly introduce the protected β-hydroxyethyl
chain to obtain product 4 were unsuccessful, plausibly
due to the lower reactivity of the corresponding alkyl halides/tosylate.
Base-induced allylation of imide 3 using allyl bromide
was feasible, but always resulted in the diallylated imide 5 as a major product in very good yields. The above specified difficulty
of diallylation was circumvented by using bulky prenyl bromide to
exclusively obtain the mono-prenylated product 6 in 83%
yield (Scheme 2). All
attempts to directly transform the imide 6 into indolizinoindolone 9 in one pot via regioselective Grignard reaction, acid-induced
Boc-deprotection, and diastereoselective Pictet–Spengler cyclization
were inefficient, and the desired product was formed only in 10–15%
yield. All of those one-pot transformations always resulted in excessive
decomposition due to the acid-sensitive nature of the initially formed
lactamol intermediate, and unfortunately, the prerequisite Boc-deprotection
reaction was relatively slow. Imide 6 was also prone
to hydrolytic cleavage under acidic conditions and therefore the Boc-deprotection
was planned under neutral reaction conditions. Imide 6 in refluxing water21 underwent smooth
Boc-deprotection and provided the desired product 7 in
96% yield. Regioselective reaction of methylmagnesium iodide with
the relatively more reactive unconjugated imide carbonyl moiety in
succinimide 7, followed by an immediate trifluoroacetic
acid-induced diastereoselective Pictet–Spengler cyclization22 of the formed lactamol 8 exclusively
furnished the expected syn-product 9 in 72% yield, via
the corresponding flat iminium-ion intermediate. The structure of
formed syn-indolizinoindolone 9 was
confirmed on the basis of X-ray crystallographic data. Osmium tetraoxide-induced
dihydroxylation reaction of compound 9 was not selective,
and two different types of carbon–carbon double bonds underwent
smooth dihydroxylations to directly yield the corresponding tetrol
product in high yield. The reaction of compound 9 under
sharpless dihydroxylation conditions23 was
regioselective at 0 °C, and the more electron-rich carbon–carbon
double bond selectively reacted to deliver the required diol 10, which was used for the next step without any purification
for polarity issues. The obtained diol 10 on sodium periodate-induced
cleavage resulted in aldehyde 11 in 67% yield. One-pot
alane reduction of aldehyde and lactam units in compound 11 delivered the desired product 12. The formed amine 12 was very unstable plausibly due to the high air-oxidation
propensity, and it was immediately used for the next step without
any purification and characterization.3 The obtained product 12 on treatment with mesyl chloride
underwent clean mesylation and in situ intramolecular cyclization
to provide the final product (±)-epi-subincanadine
C (13) in 81% yield. The obtained analytical and spectral
data for (±)-epi-subincanadine C (13) were in complete agreement with the assigned structure, and the
final product was obtained in 10 steps with 28% overall yield.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of (±)-epi-Subincanadine C via Diastereoselective
Intramolecular Pictet–Spengler Cyclization
Scheme 3 Attempted Base-Induced Mono-Alkylations
An anti-addition of cuprate
to the α,β-unsaturated
γ-methyllactam was essential to accomplish the synthesis of
(±)-subincanadine C. However, the recent literature precedents,
including one from our research group, state that exclusive syn-addition
of cuprate takes place on such type of substrates and the scientific
reason for such unusual stereoselections is still unknown.13,24,25 As depicted in Scheme 4, we planned to study the feasibility of anti-addition of
cuprate to indolizinoindolone 15 to accomplish the synthesis
of (±)-subincanadine C. Imide 1 on selective 1,2-addition
of methylmagnesium iodide followed by acid-induced Pictet–Spengler
cyclization furnished the desired indolizinoindolone 15 in 85% yield over two steps. The planned 1,4-addition of allyl cuprate
to compound 15 also exclusively yielded an unusual syn-addition
product 16 in 83% yield. The syn-orientation of methyl
and allyl groups in product 16 was initially established
by two-dimensional NMR studies. Finally, we decided to study the stereoselectivity
in reduction of carbon–carbon double bond of α,β-unsaturated
γ-lactam with a hope to obtain anti-relationship between two
substituents, which was essential to achieve the synthesis of (±)-subincanadine
C. Therefore, product 16 was N-Boc-protected
and treated with LDA/phenylselenyl chloride, which formed the relatively
more stable isomer 18 in 96% yield over two steps. The
compound 18 on oxidative elimination of phenylselenium
resulted in the expected α,β-unsaturated γ-lactam 19 in 73% yield. Lactam 19 on reaction with Mg/MeOH
underwent selective reduction of the α,β-unsaturated double
bond and again exclusively formed the syn-product 17 in
67% yield. Compound 19 on OsO4-dihydroxylation,
oxidative cleavage, and NaBH4 reduction yielded alcohol 20 in 89% yield, which on Boc-deprotection furnished the desired
α,β-unsaturated lactam 21 in 94% yield. The
catalytic hydrogenation of compound 21 with H2/Pd–C and also the reduction by radical pathway using Mg/MeOH
took place in a usual fashion, and unfortunately, both provided only
the syn-product 22 in very good yields. Compound 16 on dihydroxylation and oxidative cleavage followed by reduction
also directly delivered the same product 22 in 92% yield.
The syn-relation of methyl and β-hydroxyethyl groups in thus-formed
product 22 was also confirmed by X-ray crystallographic
analysis of its O-pivaloyl derivative (compound 23 from Experimental Section). Product 22 can be transformed into (±)-epi-subincanadine
C via double Boc-protection, dehydrative condensation with acetaldehyde,
and reductive intramolecular cyclization pathway.13 Thus, an attempt to synthesize (±)-subincanadine C
has also resulted in yet another efficient approach to (±)-epi-subincanadine C.

γ-Lactams Leading to Exclusive syn-Products: An Attempted Synthesis
of (±)-Subincanadine C
Conclusions
In summary, an early-stage stereoselective
introduction of the
desired carbon–carbon double bond via Wittig reaction was useful
to activate methylene protons for base-induced smooth prenylation
and also to govern the regioselectivity in Grignard addition. Diastereoselective
practical approaches to (±)-epi-subincanadine
C have been developed via regioselective oxidative carbon–carbon
double-bond cleavage and an exceptional syn-stereoselection in Michael
addition of cuprate to the unsaturated γ-lactam. The proper
scientific reasoning for such type of unusual stereoselectivities
is essential and still remains as an unanswered challenging question.
Our present approach is quite flexible and will provide efficient
synthetic paths to subincanadines A–G and focused mini-library
of their congeners and derivatives for structure–activity relationship
studies.

Method A
To a stirred solution of compound (±)-21 (100 mg, 0.35 mmol) in MeOH (7 mL) was added activated
Pd/C (10 mg, 10 wt %) at 25 °C, and the reaction mixture was
stirred under balloon pressure hydrogen atmosphere for 2 h. The reaction
mixture was filtered to remove Pd/C, and the concentration of the
filtrate in vacuo followed by purification of the obtained residue
by column chromatography (silica gel, 230–400 mesh, MeOH–CH2Cl2, 5:95) afforded compound (±)-22 as a solid (88 mg, 88%).

Method B
To a
solution of compound (±)-21 (100 mg, 0.35 mmol)
in dry MeOH (10 mL) was added activated Mg turnings
(59 mg, 2.48 mmol) at 25 °C under argon atmosphere, and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 12 h. The reaction was quenched with aqueous
NH4Cl, and the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo.
The obtained residue was dissolved in EtOAc (10 mL), and the organic
layer was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The concentration of the organic layer in vacuo followed by purification
of the obtained residue by column chromatography (silica gel, 230–400
mesh, MeOH–CH2Cl2, 5:95) yielded pure
(±)-22 as a solid (62 mg, 62%).

Method C
To a stirred solution of compound (±)-16 (100
mg, 0.35 mmol) in THF/H2O (3:1, 12 mL)
was added NMO (50% in water, 417 μL, 1.78 mmol) and catalytic
amount of OsO4 solution in t-BuOH (0.50
M, 0.05 mL) at 25 °C, and the reaction mixture was stirred for
12 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated solution of Na2S2O3 and further stirred for 30 min.
The aqueous layer was extracted in EtOAc (2 × 20 mL), and the
combined organic layer was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The organic layer was concentrated in vacuo,
and the obtained diol was directly used for the next step. To a stirred
solution of obtained diol in THF/H2O (1:1, 10 mL) was added
NaIO4 (169 mg, 0.79 mmol) at 25 °C in two lots, and
the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was stirred
for 1 h and diluted with EtOAc (40 mL). The organic layer was washed
with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The concentration
of the organic layer in vacuo yielded aldehyde, which was immediately
used for the next reaction for stability issue. To a stirred solution
of the above-mentioned aldehyde in MeOH (8 mL) was added NaBH4 (26 mg, 0.70 mmol) at 0 °C, and the reaction mixture
was stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with aqueous NH4Cl, and the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The
obtained residue was dissolved in EtOAc (15 mL), and the organic layer
was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4.
