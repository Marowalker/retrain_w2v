Eight new organometallic Ru(II)–arene
complexes of the type
[RuCl2(η6-arene)(η1-S-aroylthiourea)] (arene = p-cymene or
benzene) were synthesized in order to evaluate the effect of the arene
moiety and the substituent of the aroylthiourea ligand on the cytotoxicity
of the complexes. The ligands (L1 and L2) and complexes (1–8) were characterized using analytical and spectroscopic (UV–visible,
infrared, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass) methods.
The structure of the ligands (L1 and L2) and complexes (1 and 3–6) was obtained from single-crystal X-ray
diffraction studies. The cytotoxicity of the complexes was evaluated
against four different cancer cell lines: MCF-7 (breast), COLO 205
(colon), A549 (lung), and IMR-32 (neuroblastoma). All the complexes
showed good cytotoxicity and the highest was in the IMR-32 cell line,
which articulates the specificity of these complexes toward the IMR-32
cancer cell line. The complexes 5, 7, and 8 exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity in the entire cancer cell
lines tested, which was comparable with the standard drug, cisplatin.
The anticancer mechanism of the complexes 3 and 7 in IMR-32 cells was evaluated by bright-field microscopy,
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP), DNA damage, and caspase-3 analyses. The cells treated
with the complexes showed upregulated caspase-3 compared to the control,
and it was found that ROS and MMP were dose-dependent on analysis.
Also, bright-field microscopy and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) staining have correspondingly shown cellular membrane
blebbing and DNA damage, which were morphological hallmarks of apoptosis.
The study concluded that the complexes promoted the oxidative stress-mediated
apoptotic death of the cancer cells through the generation of intracellular
ROS, depletion of MMP, and damage of the nuclear material.

==== Body
Introduction
Cancer is described
as a large family of diseases that involve
abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other
parts of the body.1 It is one among the
widespread diseases wherein the research toward its complete cure
has still not triumphed. In 2015, about 90.5 million people were reported
to have cancer.2 Subsequently, there have
been cases of different types of cancers which reached up to a whopping
number of 14.1 million a year and the disease has almost claimed about
8.8 million lives (15.7%) till date.3 There
are numerous methods available for the treatment of cancer such as
chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, surgery, and palliative care. Chemotherapy,
which is known to be quite effective, has been broadly investigated
with the usage of organometallic drugs4,5 and operates
on the principle of the drug interacting with the DNA of the cells
that are dividing rapidly and altering it, thus killing them and restricting
their growth.

Platinum-based anticancer drugs have been dictating
the area till
now; cisplatin and its derivatives (carboplatin, oxaliplatin, nedaplatin,
etc.) are the most effective. Whereas the chemotherapeutic success
of these drugs is undeniable, they by no means provide the perfect
cure.6−8 There are several cancer cell lines which show drug
resistance, which has a deplorable range of side effects including
neurotoxicity, hair loss, and nausea. These led scientists to explore
the area using other biologically relevant metal ions, particularly
ruthenium. Ruthenium comes into play in biological applications as
it can mimic iron in binding to transferrin and has similar ligand
exchange kinetics to that of platinum. Over the years, attention toward
ruthenium has broadened; ruthenium red has been known to inhibit Ca2+ uptake,9 complexes of Ru(II)
have been documented as nitric oxide scavengers, antimetastatics,
immunosuppressants, antibiotics, radiopharmaceuticals, antiparasitics,
and also as anticancer agents which have given the metal ion its head
start in the field of therapeutics.10,11 The ruthenium-based
drug NAMI-A which succeeded in phase I clinical trials got rejected
because of its limited efficacy in phase II clinical trials; however,
the sodium salt of KP1019 (KP1339) is currently undergoing clinical
trials.12 However, organometallic half-sandwich
Ru(II) complexes have been established as a separate arena, and their
anticancer activity has been well studied recently. Ruthenium(II)–arene
RAPTA-type compounds have been widely investigated for their therapeutic
properties. These complexes offer numerous ways to tune its structural
parameters and electronic property. The change in the arene moiety
or any of the other ligands is expected to influence reactions of
the complex, thus altering the biological activity and redox property.12−19

Ligands derived from thiourea are mostly crystalline and known
to be quite thermally stable.20 They can
be synthesized in good yields from readily available starting materials
using a simple procedure. These compounds have gained importance in
the pharmacological sector, in agriculture, and in the synthesis of
heterocycles.19−23 Aroylthioureas are thiourea derivatives that have been recognized
for their variable modes of coordination with metal ions.24

Aroylthiourea complexes have had a widespread
reach in the fields
of therapeutics, agriculture, corrosion, and catalysis.25−28 Furthermore, their complexes have shown excellent biological properties
including antibacterial, antiviral, antitubercular, antifungal, and
anti-inflammatory.28−32 Our group has been studying the anticancer activity of aroylthiourea
and related complexes, obtaining moderate results.24,32−35 Therefore, in the interest of developing superior drugs than the
ones obtained previously, herein, we report the synthesis of new Ru(II)–arene
complexes containing diverse aroylthiourea ligands.

Results and Discussion
Formation
of the Ligands and Complexes
The aroylthiourea
ligands (L1–L4) were synthesized by treating aroyl chloride
with the corresponding primary amine, after an hour of reflux with
potassium thiocyanate.24 The corresponding
ruthenium(II) complexes of the type [RuCl2(η6-arene)(η1-S-aroylthiourea)]
(1–8) were derived from the reactions involving
[RuCl(μ-Cl)(η6-arene)]2 (arene = p-cymene or benzene) and aroylthiourea ligands (L1–L4)
(Scheme 1). All the
complexes were found to be stable in both solid and solution states.
The complexes 1–4 were soluble in most of the
organic solvents, whereas 5–8 were soluble only
in highly polar organic solvents, but both were insoluble in water.
The aroylthiourea ligands (L1 and L2) and Ru(II)–arene complexes
(1–8) were characterized by elemental analyses
and IR, UV–visible, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; 1H and 13C), and mass spectroscopic methods. The structure
of representative compounds (L1, L2, 1, and 3–6) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Aroylthiourea
Ligands (L1–L4) and Their Corresponding
Ru(II)–Arene Complexes (1–8)
Characterization by Spectroscopic
Methods
The electronic
absorption spectra of the ligands (L1 and L2) and complexes (1–8) were recorded in dimethylformamide in the range
of 200–800 nm (Figure S1). The ligands
showed a band at 267–279 cm–1 because of
π → π* transition, whereas the complexes showed
the corresponding band at 269–285 cm–1. A
band at 306–340 cm–1 corresponding to n →
π* transition was shown by the ligands, whereas the complexes
showed the same at 331–352 cm–1.

The
IR spectra of complexes 1–8 (Figure S2) showed a ν(C=S) stretching at a lower
wavenumber than that of the corresponding ligands, whereas the remaining
stretching frequencies resided almost in the same region, which signified
the neutral coordination of aroylthiourea via sulfur atom (Figures S2–S11).

The 1H NMR spectra (Figures S12–S21)
of the ligands (L1 and L2) showed chemical shifts of amide and
thioamide N–H at 12.37–12.28 and 12.20–9.42 ppm,
respectively. The downfield shift of the signal because of thioamide
proton authenticated its hydrogen bonding with carbonyl oxygen, forming
a six-membered ring.24 All the aromatic
protons displayed resonances in the characteristic range of 8.03–7.27
ppm. In the 1H NMR spectra of the complexes (1–4), signals of amide and thioamide N–H appeared in the same
region as that of their corresponding ligands, which substantiated
their noninvolvement in the complex formation. The comparative study
of NMR spectra of the benzene and p-cymene complexes
along with the ligand is shown in Figure 1. After complexation, there was a minor shift
in the δ value of N–H protons, which may be attributed
to hydrogen bonding of the thioamide and amide N–H protons
with carbonyl oxygen and Ru(II)–Cl, respectively. The decrease
in the difference of chemical shifts between the two N–H protons
in the p-cymene and benzene complexes may be attributed
to the presence of electron-donating substituents in the arene moiety
of the former complexes. New signals that emerged in the range 5.40–5.26,
3.01–2.72, 2.41–2.13, and 1.28–1.17 ppm for complexes 1–4 showed the occurrence of the p-cymene moiety,24 whereas a singlet at
5.98 ppm in the spectra of complexes 5–8 suggested
the presence of benzene moiety.34 In the
spectra of complexes 3 and 7, the methyl
protons were observed at 2.24 and 2.34 ppm, respectively.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra of L1 and its Ru–arene complexes.

In the 13C NMR spectra (Figures S22–S31) of the ligands, thiocarbonyl (C=S) and
carbonyl (C=O) peaks appeared at 180.9–177.6 and 167.5–165.2
ppm, respectively. The ligands (L1 and L2) displayed signals at 139.1–122.6
ppm, which were credited to the aromatic carbons. The 13C NMR spectra of the complexes (1–8) did not
show any pronounced shift. However, new signals appeared at 103.5–103.2,
99.9–99.8, 84.1–83.8, 82.9–82.7, 30.4–30.2,
22.2–22.0, and 18.3–18.2 ppm, validating the presence
of p-cymene moiety in complexes 1–4,24 and a signal at 88.1 ppm for complexes 5–8 signified the presence of a benzene ring.34 In the spectra of complexes 3 and 7, the methyl carbon signals appeared at 18.3 and 21.4 ppm,
respectively.

The ligands (L1 and L2) exhibited the [M + H+]+ ion peak as their molecular ion peak in their
mass spectra and the m/z of the
[M – 2H+ –
2Cl– + H+]+ fragment was found
to be the value of the molecular ion peak of the complexes (Figures S32–S41).24,34

Structure Analysis
The crystal structure of the ligands
(L1 and L2) and complexes (1, 3–5 and 6) is shown in Figures S42 and S43 and 2–6. The crystallographic data and refinement
parameters for L1, L2, 1, 3–5, and 6 are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. The crystals were obtained from slow evaporation of dichloromethane–acetonitrile
(1:1) solutions of the samples. The ligands (L1 and L2) crystallized
in the triclinic P1̅ space group. The structure
of ligand L1 contained two independent molecules in the unit cell,
which were closely comparable. The C6H3Cl2 group was found disordered between two positions in the structure
of L1, which was successfully modeled (occupancy ratio of 0.93:0.07).
Both the ligands contain one intramolecular hydrogen bond between
thioamide N–H and carbonyl oxygen atom [N(2)–H···O(1)
= 2.1490 (L1) and 2.1490 Å (L2)]. The bond distances and angles
were in the allowed range and were comparable with similar structures.24,34

The X-ray diffraction validated the predicted monodentate
coordination
of sulfur in Ru(II)–arene complexes. The complexes (1 and 3–6) adopted the characteristic piano stool
geometry, wherein the π-bonded arene moiety (p-cymene or benzene) occupied the “seat of the stool”,
the two chloride ligands and sulfur from the aroylthiourea ligand
occupied the residual three coordination legs. Complexes 1, 4, and 6 crystallized in triclinic P1̅ whereas the other two complexes (3 and 5) crystallized in monoclinic C2/c space group. The ruthenium to chloride bond
distances (2.4040–2.4384 Å) are almost identical, whereas
the distances of Ru–C and Ru–S bonds for the complexes
were found to be in the range of 2.2195–2.1490 and 2.4120–2.3983
Å, respectively; these distances were usual and were comparable
to those of other previously reported Ru–arene complexes.24,34 The bond angles of S–Ru–Cl and Cl–Ru–Cl
lay in the range of 94.83°–85.81°. One of the chloride
ligands and the carbonyl oxygen were involved in hydrogen bonding
with amide N–H [N–H···Cl, 2.19–2.85
Å] and thioamide N–H [N–H···O, 1.88–1.96
Å], respectively. The other bond distances and angles were in
the allowed range and were comparable with similar structures.36−39 For 4, elongated thermal ellipsoids on atoms C9–C18,
C26, and C27 indicated possible disorder, which was modeled successfully
between two positions, each with an occupancy ratio very close to
0.50. Appropriate restraints and/or constraints were used to keep
the bond distances, angles, and thermal ellipsoids meaningful.

Stability
Studies
To evaluate the stability of the
complexes in water/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions, the NMR spectra
of complexes 3 and 7 were recorded in different
time intervals (0, 1, 6, and 24 h) in a D2O/DMSO-d6 (2:8) mixture. Prior to this, the stability
of the complexes were tested in DMSO-d6 (0, 6 and 24 h), and they retained all the peaks in the respective
regions over a period of 24 h (Figures S44 and S45). Upon the addition of D2O, there was a disappearance
of amide N–H and the thioamide N–H protons within an
hour in the 1H NMR spectra of the complexes, which may
be due to rapid exchange of the two N–H protons with the D2O solvent (Figures S46 and S47).
Other peaks of the complexes remained unaltered throughout the time
monitored, suggesting their stability.16,17

The
stability of complexes 3 and 7 was also
evaluated in the biological medium using UV–visible spectroscopy,
wherein they displayed the characteristic peaks in the range 200–800
nm (Figures S48 and S49). The absence of
significant changes in the spectral characteristics of the tested
complexes over the time may suggest that no structural alternations
occurred in the biological medium.16,18

Interaction
with Glutathione
Glutathione (GSH) is known
to cause the detoxification of anticancer drugs as the metal center
of these drugs gets involved in coordination with it. Hence, the most
active complex 7 was studied for its interaction with
GSH. The complex bound to GSH after a period of 12 h, which was evident
from the appearance of new peaks in the down-field region of the NMR
spectrum (Figure S50).17

Anticancer Activity of the Complexes
The cytotoxic
activity of the complexes (1–8) was evaluated
against four different cancer (MCF-7, COLO 205, A549, and IMR-32)
cell lines. The percentages of cell viability versus concentration graphs are shown in Figure 7. The half-minimum inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values of the complexes are tabulated (Table 1). All the complexes
were most active in the IMR-32 [IC50 = 8–47 μM]
cell line, which declared the selectivity of the complexes, of which
the complexes 7, 5, and 3 showed
cytotoxicity which was comparable to that of the standard, cisplatin.
However, neither the substituents on the aroyl end nor at the N terminal
seem to have a role in the cytotoxicity of the complexes, although
we can say that a ligand does play a role in the cytotoxicity as the
same ligand exhibited a greater activity in both p-cymene (3) and benzene (7) complexes.

Among the complexes, the most active ones, 7 [IC50 = 8 ± 2 μM] (arene = benzene) and 3 [IC50 = 10 ± 2 μM] (arene = p-cymene), were chosen from each set of the complexes to further study
their anticancer activity in the IMR-32 cell line at IC50 and IC90 concentrations. The IC50 value on
the normal cell line Vero for the active complexes 7 and 3 was found to be 157 ± 3 and 131 ± 2 μM,
respectively. The value was much higher when compared to the same
in the cancer cell lines and hence it seemed that the complexes were
less toxic toward the normal cell line and could be safe and biocompatible.

Apoptosis Cell Death Mechanism
The anticancer mechanism
of complexes 3 and 7 in IMR-32 cells was
studied using bright-field microscopy, intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA damage,
and caspase-3 analyses.

In bright-field microscopic assessment,
control cells displayed the cell body and dendrites, reflecting the
well-being of the cells. However, the cells treated with IC50 concentration of complexes 3 and 7 evidently
showed cellular membrane damage, leakage of cellular debris, and formation
of apoptotic bodies (Figure 8).40 The intensity of cellular
damage and formation of apoptotic bodies was quite highly evident
at IC90 values.

Figure 8 Bright-field microscopic images of IMR-32 cells.
(A) Control cells.
(B,C) were cells treated with IC50 (5 ± 1 μM)
and IC90 (9 ± 0.2) of cisplatin, respectively. (D,E)
were cells treated with IC50 (10 ± 2 μM) and
IC90 (19 ± 0.1 μM) of complex 3, respectively. (F,G) were cells treated with IC50 (8
± 2 μM) and IC90 (14 ± 1 μM) of complex 7, respectively. The arrows indicate the cellular membrane
damage, apoptotic bodies, and cellular debris. All the images were
captured at a magnification of 400×.

Next, the level of intracellular ROS was measured by 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and it is one of the most commonly used
techniques for quantitative analysis of oxidative stress. DCFH-DA
readily diffuses into the cell and gets deacetylated to a nonfluorescent
compound by cellular esterases, which is later oxidized to fluorescent
2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein by intracellular ROS molecules.
The intensity of fluorescence is directly proportional to the level
of ROS molecules.41−44 In the present study, cells treated with complexes 3 and 7 showed higher ROS levels compared to the control
cells and ROS was found to be dose-dependent (Figures 9 and 12). The cells
treated with IC50 and IC90 concentration of
complexes 3 and 7 showed bright green fluorescence,
which was found to be higher at IC90.

ROS by DCFH-DA staining. (A) Control
cells. (B,C) were cells treated with IC50 (5 ± 1 μM)
and IC90 (9 ± 0.2 μM) of cisplatin, respectively.
(D,E) were cells treated with IC50 (10 ± 2 μM)
and IC90 (19 ± 0.1 μM) of complex 3, respectively. (F,G) were cells treated with IC50 (8
± 2 μM) and IC90 (14 ± 1 μM) of complex 7, respectively. The bright green fluorescence under the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) filter directly proportionate to the intracellular
ROS.

Further, the MMP of the cells
was measured by rhodamine 123 staining.
The rhodamine 123 is a cell-permeant, cationic, green-fluorescent
dye and is used in the measure of membrane polarization.45,46 The intensity of fluorescence directly reflects the MMP of the cell.
Here, control cells showed bright green fluorescence, which appealed
to the well-being of the cell (Figures 10 and 12). In contrast,
the MMP of cells depleted on treatment with complexes 3 and 7 and was dose-dependent. The greater MMP depletion
was noticed at IC90 value of the complexes.

(B,C) were cells treated with IC50 (5 ± 1 μM)
and IC90 (9 ± 0.2 μM) of cisplatin, respectively.
(D,E) were cells treated with IC50 (10 ± 2 μM)
and IC90 (19 ± 0.1 μM) of complex 3, respectively. (F,G) were cells treated with IC50 (8
± 2 μM) and IC90 (14 ± 1 μM) of complex 7, respectively. The bright green fluorescence under the GFP
filter directly proportionate to the MMP.

In the next study, the effect of complexes 3 and 7 on the nuclear material of the cell was demonstrated
by
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (Figure 11). The DAPI dye can pass through
an intact cell membrane of both live and dead cells. However, DAPI
passes less efficiently through the membrane of live cells and generates
lower fluorescence compared to that in dead cells.46,47 In the present study, control cells have shown a blue fluorescent
nucleus at the center of the cell and the nucleus was found intact
and unbroken. However, the cells treated with complexes 3 and 7 showed higher intensity of fluorescence compared
to the control and displayed dispersion or leakage of nuclear fragments
from the cell, which concluded as DNA damage.

were cells treated with IC50 (5 ± 1 μM) and

(D,E) were cells treated with IC50 (10 ± 2 μM)
and IC90 (19 ± 0.1 μM) of complex 3, respectively. (F,G) are cells treated with IC50 (8 ±
2 μM) and IC90 (14 ± 1 μM) of complex 7, respectively. The arrows indicate the dispersed and damaged
nuclear material of the cell.

Finally, the role of the complexes in the promotion of the
apoptotic
process was assessed by caspase-3 analysis. The caspases are decisive
mediators and their upregulation promotes the death of the cell by
apoptosis.46−48 The caspases are activated in apoptotic process by
extrinsic (death receptor) or intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways.
The morphological hallmarks of apoptosis include fragmentation of
DNA and blebbing of cellular membrane.49 In the present study, the cells treated with complexes showed upregulated
caspase-3 compared to control and were found dose-dependent in ROS
and MMP analyses (Figure 12). Also, bright-field microscopy and DAPI
staining have correspondingly shown cellular membrane blebbing and
DNA damage, which were morphological hallmarks of apoptosis. Overall,
the study expresses that the complexes are probable anticancer agents
and may promote the oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic death of the
cancer cells through generation of intracellular ROS, depletion of
the MMP, and damage of the nuclear material.

results are expressed as mean ± SD.

The biological relevance of ruthenium was very first seen
in the
1950s by Dwyer and his co-workers.50−52 However, discovery of
cisplatin by Rosenberg and co-workers52−54 created a blueprint
for the effect of metal complexes on the anticancer activity, which
led to the development of ruthenium anticancer drugs and the arena
has been ever flourishing.56 Ru–arene
complexes seem to have an improved activity when compared to the organometallic
anticancer compounds which are currently on clinical trial or in use.55 These complexes are stable and their scaffolds
offer a significant scope for augmenting the biological activity and
minimizing the side effects by altering the arene and other coordinated
ligands.14−16 The added advantages of Ru complexes are their biomolecular
interactions with albumin and transferrin in blood plasma, actins
on the cell surface, or collagens of the extracellular matrix, regulatory
enzymes within the cell membrane/in the cytoplasm, and DNA in the
cell’s nucleus. Schmitt et al. reported 4-aryl-4H-naphthopyran-based Ru–arene complexes with a cytotoxicity
ranging from 0.5 to 966 μM in various cancer cell lines.57 Meier-Menches et al. summarized structure–activity
relationships for ruthenium and osmium metallodrugs with respect to in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo tumor-inhibiting
properties.58 In recent times alone, there
have been many publications on the biological applications of Ru–arene
complexes.59−63 However, still Ru–arene complexes containing aroylthiourea
ligands have not been extensively researched in the past for their
biological activities though Ru–arene and aroylthiourea compounds
were independently known for their biological potentials. Among the
available Ru–arene complexes with thiourea ligands, our complexes
exhibited better cytotoxicity. In the past, Ru–p-cymene complexes bearing monodentate (S) aroylthiourea ligand showed
IC50 value of 55–102 (A549) and 52–500 μM
(MCF-7) in cancer cell lines,24 whereas
similar complexes with benzene as the arene moiety showed an IC50 value of 96–250 and 151–163 μM in A549
and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively.34 Cationic
Ru–p-cymene complexes of bidentate (N, S)
thiourea derivatives have displayed IC50 values of 32–40
μM in the A549 cell line.64 Ru–p-cymene complexes with the monodentate (S) aroylthiourea
ligand showed an IC50 value of 23–44 μM, whereas
the bidentate coordination (O, S) of the same ligand with Ru–p-cymene yielded an IC50 value of 10–17
μM in the A549 cancer cell line (Figures 13 and 14).65 It is obvious that IC50 values of
our complexes are well comparable to that of reported Ru–arene
complexes. Although the comparison with well-known anticancer drug,
cisplatin, proved less effective, it is a persuasive factor that there
are evidences for complexes which had higher IC50 values
than cisplatin in vitro exhibited better activity in vivo.65−67

Conclusions
In
summary, a series of Ru–arene complexes containing the
aroylthiourea ligand as an anticancer agent have been designed, synthesized,
and characterized. The molecular structure of the ligands (L1 and
L2) and complexes (1 and 3–6) was
solved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, with the complexes
showing the typical piano-stool geometry adopted by Ru–arene
complexes. The cytotoxic activity of the complexes was evaluated in
four different (MCF-7, COLO 205, A549, and IMR-32) cancer cell lines.
Complexes 5, 7, and 8 exhibited
cytotoxicity in close range with the standard cisplatin in four cell
lines (MCF-7, COLO 205, A549, and IMR-32) tested, which ascertains
the potential activity of the complexes. All the complexes showed
highest activity (IC50 = 7–46 μM) against
human neuroblastoma (IMR-32) cancer cells, awarding them their selective
nature. The active complexes 3 and 7 showed
less toxicity on normal cell line Vero compared to the cancer cell
line. The anticancer mechanism of these two complexes was studied
further by bright-field microscopy, intracellular ROS, MMP, DNA damage,
and caspase-3 analyses. The studies revealed dose-dependent ROS and
MMP and upregulation of caspase-3. On summation of the studies, it
may be said that the complexes promote the oxidative stress-mediated
apoptotic death of the cancer cells through generation of intracellular
ROS, depletion of MMP, and damage of the nuclear material.

In Vitro Anticancer Activity
Cytotoxic
activity of the Ru–arene complexes (1–8) was investigated on four different human cancer cell lines such
as MCF-7 (breast), COLO 205 (colon), A549 (lung), and IMR-32 (brain)
by cell viability assay that is MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide). The cytotoxicity of the most cytotoxic Ru–arene complexes
(3 and 7) of different chemical nature (arene
= p-cymene/benzene) was appraised on the normal cell
line Vero (kidney) by MTT assay as well. The anticancer mechanism
of 3 and 7 was evaluated in the IMR-32 cancer
cell line by assessing the intracellular ROS, MMP, DNA damage, and
caspase-3 activity by DCFH-DA, rhodamine 123, DAPI, and caspase-3
assay kit, respectively.
