The current work reports the thermophysical
and flow measurements of novel thermal solvents based on deep eutectic
solvents (DESs) and alumina-based nanoparticle-dispersed deep eutectic
solvents (NDDESs) for its use as a potential solar energy storage
medium. The DESs were synthesized using a hydrogen bond donor (i.e.,
oleic acid) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (i.e., dl-menthol)
by using the COSMO-SAC-predicted equimolar ratio at a temperature
of 350.15 K. Thereafter, NDDESs or nanofluids were formed by dispersing
different volume fractions (0.001, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01) of Al2O3 nanoparticles in the DESs. The optimum volume
fraction (0.005) of Al2O3 nanoparticles was
selected through their thermophysical properties (density, viscosity,
thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity) and its agglomeration
or stability behavior. As expected, NDDESs with a 0.005 volume fraction
gave a higher enhancement in thermal conductivity, viscosity, heat
capacity, and density as compared to DESs. To evaluate the heat transfer
coefficient, forced convection experiments were conducted in a circular
test section for both DESs and NDDESs under laminar conditions (Re = 124, 186, and 250). The enhancement of the local heat
transfer coefficient was found to be higher when compared to their
thermophysical properties. This was due to the nanoparticle migration
resulting in a non-uniform distribution of both thermal conductivity
and viscosity fields, which was inherently found to reduce the thermal
boundary layer thickness. In the final section, the heat transfer
coefficient and the Nusselt number were also validated with COMSOL
Multiphysics simulations.

1 Introduction
Concentrating
solar power (CSP) is currently recognized as a valuable source of
renewable energy.1 The stored thermal energy
can be utilized in various thermodynamic cycles such as Brayton cycle
to generate turbine power from gas turbine engines. The advantage
of CSP is that the energy stored in daylight can be used at nighttime
where the thermal fluid can potentially reuse the solar energy. The
main drawback includes its elevated cost as compared to conventional
energy sources. For this reason, the scientific community aims to
improve the overall efficiency of these solar plants. One of them
is to improve the efficiency of the heat transfer processes that occur
in this application. CSP plants usually adopt a technology involving
parabolic cylindrical collectors, which in turn uses a heat transfer
fluid for the storage and transport of heat. Keeping the CSP process
in mind, increasing the heat transfer effect is a key deliverable
usually obtained by enhancing the thermophysical properties of these
fluids. The current study is thus meant for generating turbine power
using the CSP energy storage.

In CSP, the solar energy is usually
concentrated using mirrors and lenses and stored in a thermal fluid.
The working fluid used in the CSP plant plays an important role in
determining the overall efficiency of the system. The conventional
thermal fluids have low-to-moderate thermal stability and heat storage
capacity, which results in high operating costs.1 Researchers have tried ionic liquids (ILs) as one of the
alternatives for heat transfer fluid for future generations.2 However, ILs are highly viscous, costly, and
difficult to synthesize. Application of ILs in solar collector applications3,4 have been recently reported. Wu et al.3 have focused the applicability of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate,
1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-trifluromethane sulfonamide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate,
and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-trifluromethane
sulfonamide as a thermal energy storage medium for solar collectors.
The storage density of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate
was found to be 378 MJ/m3. Moens and Blake4 have performed an overall assessment of ILs for its use
as a heat transfer fluid in solar parabolic trough systems.

To lessen the cost associated with ionic liquids, many countries
have shifted to molten salts (KNO3, NaNO2, and
NaNO3) as a heat transfer fluid in CSP. However, it also
suffers from the problem of high freezing point when the temperature
drop reaches below 473.15 K and thus possesses a maintenance problem.5 Other issues with molten salts are their low
specific heat capacity values and their corrosive nature. As compared
to other green solvents such as ILs or molten salt mixtures, deep
eutectic solvents (DESs) are inexpensive and are nowadays a substitute
for thermal fluids. The extended benefits of using DESs would be surpassing
the inherent shortcomings of comparable green solvents, particularly
with respect to density and viscosity,6,7 which are essential
parameters for heat transfer. In this regard, DESs have several excellent
physical and chemical properties including high thermal stability,
low melting point, higher air and moisture stability, nonflammability,
high heat capacity, and low density.8−11

DESs are the product of
two or more entities in which hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and hydrogen
bond acceptors (HBAs) are combined to form liquids upon mixing with
melting points below those of the individual components.12−14 Some researchers also designate DESs as low melting mixtures (LMMs),
deep eutectic ionic liquids (DEILs), or low transition temperature
mixtures (LTTMs).15 Overall, DESs have
a low volatility, have a wide liquid range, and are water-compatible,
nontoxic, and biocompatible, and some of them are biodegradable.16,17 Other advantages of DESs include low cost of its constituents, ease
of preparation, tunable physicochemical properties, and negligible
vapor pressure. Some typical hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are
listed in Table 1.

Table 1 Typical Salts and Hydrogen Bond Donors of Deep Eutectic
Solvents
In addition to
that within the past decade, nanofluids have gained attention for
the thermal property enhancement of base fluids. Earlier results have
pointed out the fact that thermal conductivity of the IL-based heat
transfer fluid increases as the diameter of the nanoparticle is reduced.
On the other hand, the major drawback of nanofluids is that the coefficient
of friction and pressure drop also increases with volume fraction.
Thus, an optimum volume or mass fraction of nanoparticles with base
fluid needs to be chosen based on both thermophysical properties and
the flow regime. Further, the results also suggest that the nanofluids
do improve the convective heat transfer, particularly at the entrance
region. Based on an earlier work by Li et al.,18 the local heat transfer coefficient increases by 60% for
a Cu–water-based nanofluid containing 2% Cu nanoparticles by
volume, while on the other hand, the nanofluids possess only an effective
thermal conductivity 12.5% higher than that of the base liquid. This
may be due to the particle migration that results in a non-uniform
distribution of thermal conductivity and viscosity fields, which ultimately
reduces the thermal boundary layer thickness. Overall, the results
clearly show that the use of nanofluids significantly improves the
convective heat transfer, particularly at the entrance region. However,
the increase in Reynolds number or volume fraction of particles also
results in an increase in heat transfer and pressure drop. For example,
in the case of water–TiO2 nanoparticles, the heat
transfer rate of nanofluids with a concentration of 0.002 was higher
than that of the base fluid, while both of them had the same pressure
drop in the low Reynolds numbers. Therefore, dilute nanofluids may
be recommended and adopted in this work with DES-based heat transfer
fluids at low Reynolds numbers. Hence, in our studies, nanoparticle-dispersed
DESs (NDDESs) have been explored using spherical Al2O3 nanoparticles of 70 nm. Additionally, the nanoparticles have
proven to have a negligible effect on the physical properties (density
and viscosity) of the base fluid, thereby limiting the pressure drop
and also the coefficient of friction.

The idea of DESs as a
base fluid is a novel concept, since DESs behave similarly to ILs
in terms of physical and thermal characteristics. The idea of menthol-based
DESs was first proposed by Florindo et al.19 They have investigated dl-menthol with a series of HBDs
like pyruvic acid, acetic acid, l-lactic acid, and lauric
acid. On a similar note, dl-menthol with oleic acid was taken
as the two components of DESs in this work. Nanoparticle-dispersed
DESs (NDDESs) have been explored to increase the specific heat capacity
of the pure DESs without any change in their thermal stability. An
increased specific heat capacity indicates an efficient heat transfer
fluid in terms of energy storage. Many researchers used Al2O3 nanoparticles as an addition to a base fluid so as
to enhance its thermal properties (thermal conductivity and specific
heat capacity). They have also been proven to have a negligible effect
on the physical properties (density and viscosity) of the base fluid.2 Keeping these advantages in mind, the current
work has adopted spherical Al2O3 nanoparticles
to prepare the desired NDDESs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Density and Viscosity
As expected, the density of both
DESs and NDDESs was found to decrease with increasing temperature
(Figure 1). This is
due to the fact that the thermal expansion generally results in a
lower density with an increase in temperature. The measured densities
were also compared with the commercially available thermal fluids20 as well as the ILs.21 It was found that the experimentally measured density of DESs and
NDDESs of different volume fractions (0.001, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01)
was also lower than that of water.

Figure 1 Density variation of DESs and NDDESs.

The shear stress and shear strain
for both DESs and NDDESs were depicted in Figures S1–S5 of the Supporting Information, where it was observed
that the fluid obeyed a Newtonian behavior.22 Further, the viscosity of DESs and NDDESs was also measured as a
function of shear rate, where the Newtonian behavior22 was again confirmed (Figure S6–S10). The viscosity of DESs and NDDESs is plotted as a function of temperature
in Figure 2. The decrease
in viscosity of DESs was around 92% as the temperature increased from
298.15 to 423.15 K. The viscosity of DESs was found to be very close
to that of water at a higher temperature. On a similar note, the decrease
in viscosity of NDDESs was found to be ∼95% as the temperature
increased from 298.15 to 423.15 K. Overall, the addition of nanoparticles
had a less pronounced effect at a higher temperature, thereby enabling
their use at a higher temperature in CSP. The experimentally measured
viscosity was also compared with existing models, which were previously
used23−25 for nanofluids. Initially, the Einstein model23 was used for calculating the viscosity of fluid
containing a low volume fraction (<0.002) of spherical particles.
The model is given below: 1  Brinkman24 modified the Einstein fluid model for concentrated nanoparticles
as 2  Thereafter, Batchelor25 modified the Einstein model while considering the Brownian
motion of the particles. The expression for the Batchelor model is
mentioned below 3  where μNDDES and μDES are the viscosity of NDDESs and DESs, respectively, and ϕ
is the nanoparticle volume fraction. Figure S11 of the Supporting Information shows that all the models underpredict
the actual experimental values by an order of 10%. This is because
all the models (eqs 1–3) have considered nanoparticle volume
fraction. These models obviously did not incorporate the effects such
as agglomeration of nanoparticles and the liquid layering on nanoparticles.

of DESs and NDDESs as a function of temperature.

2.2 Thermal Conductivity
The thermal
conductivity of all NDDESs, when compared to the respective DESs,
indicates an increase in thermal conductivity as shown in Figure 3. It should be noted
that during the measurement of thermal conductivity, the convection
current should be avoided as the thermal analyzer considers only the
conduction mode of heat transfer.
This is true since heating the sample at a higher temperature creates
natural convection currents, which creates a density difference in
the medium. In this regard, the experiment was performed using a small
diameter tube so that the natural convection current is minimized.
The thermal conductivity of DESs has shown to decrease slightly with
increasing temperature. As compared to DESs, the thermal conductivity
of NDDESs gave an approximate average increase of ∼10%. The
increase in the thermal conductivity is similar to those observed
for TiO2–water26 and
Al2O3.27,28

Figure 3 Temperature variation
of thermal conductivity of DESs and NDDESs.

The Maxwell model29 for spherical
nanoparticles with a homogeneous suspension was considered while modeling
the thermal conductivity values. This is given below as: 4  An improvement (namely, the
Bruggeman model30) predicted a higher agreement
than the Maxwell model because it considers the clustering of nanoparticles.
The Bruggeman model30 for calculating the
thermal conductivity of NDDESs is given in eq 5. Both models are compared in Figure S12 of the Supporting Information. 5  

The specific heat capacity of DESs was found to increase with
temperature (Figure 4). The specific heat capacity of NDDESs was found to be higher than
that of DESs. As compared to base fluids (namely, DESs), the specific
heat capacity of NDDESs increased by 6%, 15%, 27%, and 50% corresponding
to nanoparticle volume fractions of 0.001, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01,
respectively. Overall, the specific heat capacity increases with the
concentration of nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 4. Similar phenomena were also observed with
Cu nanoparticles.31 This can be attributed
to the formation of an internal structure within the nanofluids, generating
a specific contact between DESs and alumina nanoparticles. One possible
outcome of this is a formation of a chain-like nanostructure that
is similar to an infiltrating network as observed in aggregated suspensions
such as nanofluids. Here, it is the DESs that initiate this nanostructure32 based on the π–π stacking
of its menthol moiety. This nanostructure formation is much larger
than that of conventional nanofluids without DESs. It is this nanostructure
that eventually contributes to the enhanced specific heat capacity
and also explains a higher particle size (i.e., 200 Å) as observed
in dynamic light scattering. It implies that the DESs are primarily
responsible for the enhanced specific heat capacity of DES-based nanofluids.
This interaction or contact depends on the nature of both DESs and
NDDESs and deserves merit in evaluating the same interaction or contact
using molecular dynamics.

Figure 4 Temperature
variation of specific heat capacity of DESs and NDDESs.

In terms of the thermal properties (Figures 3 and 4) reported above, NDDESs can be recognized as more efficient than
DESs. Looking at their physiochemical properties, NDDESs at a volume
fraction of 0.005 were chosen as an optimum choice based on their
stability (zeta potential, 97.4mV), density (Figure 1) and viscosity (Figure 2), thermal conductivity (Figure 3), and specific heat capacity
(Figure 4). The 0.001
volume fraction is not selected as it gave a specific heat capacity
and thermal conductivity values similar to NDDESs with a 0.005 volume
fraction. Nanoparticle concentrations at a higher volume fraction
(>0.005) led to practical difficulty in pumping consideration and
agglomeration behavior. Hence, this negated our choice. This led us
to choose a 0.005 volume fraction NDDESs as the optimum value with
respect to the thermophysical properties and stability. Further, the
stability behavior of the nanofluids was checked by zeta potential
and visual observation under stagnant conditions and was also subjected
to centrifugal force at various speeds for 5 min. Here, the speeds
were varied from 5000 to 15,000 rpm. The nanofluids were considered
stable only when no particles or sediments were observed even after
10 min.

2.3 Forced Convection Studies
The COMSOL
simulations have been performed in COMSOL Multiphysics (version 5.2a).
Initially, the space dimension as 2D axisymmetric was selected. A
no-slip boundary conditions and a uniform heat flux were applied to
the wall. A time-dependent study was performed so as to ascertain
steady state. The dimensions of the test section were assumed to be
rectangular (length, 1000 mm; width, 9 mm). The two-dimensional tube
geometry was generated by a COMSOL built-in meshing tool, where a
total of 228,680 mesh elements were created. Experimentally measured
thermophysical properties (density, viscosity, conductivity, and specific
heat capacity) as given in Figures 1–4 are used for the simulations.
Thereafter, the simulation was started with an initial guess, which
shall help us in solving the velocity and temperature profile. A uniform
heat flux of 13,312 W/m2 was applied to the wall. This
was the same flux as used in Figure 15 via heating tape. To solve the energy equation, velocity
information is necessary. This is obtained by solving the continuity
and momentum equation (eqs 11–14). Here, the flow coupling
was added explicitly as provided under the Multiphysics section within COMSOL. While Figures 5–7 discuss the heat transfer performance
of DESs, Figures 8–10 depict the NDDES performance.

Figure 5 signifies the temperature profile of DESs along the axial
distance of the test section with three different Reynolds numbers
within the laminar regime. Figure 6 represents the heat transfer coefficient of DESs along
the axial distance at a heat flux of 13,312 W/m2 in three
different Reynolds numbers. The experimental heat transfer coefficient
was compared with the numerical results, where it gave a negligible
deviation. The DESs gave enhanced heat transfer coefficient along
the entire axial distance, and the heat transfer coefficient decreases
with axial distance. As expected, the heat transfer coefficient was
also found to increase with an increase in Reynolds number. Figure 7 represents the Nusselt
number of DESs along the axial distance at three different Reynolds
numbers, where the Nusselt number increases with an increase in Reynolds
number. Al2O3 (spherical) nanoparticles with
a volume fraction of 0.005% have been chosen for both experiment and
simulation. A similar phenomenon is observed for NDDESs with respect
to temperature profile (Figure 8), heat transfer coefficient (Figure 9), and Nusselt number (Figure 10).

In both cases (DES
and NDDES), it has been found that the inside surface temperature
of the tube is higher with a decrease in Reynolds number. However,
a decrease in Reynolds number led to an ∼10% enhancement in
the surface temperature, which is evident near the entrance region.
The hydrodynamic entry length and thermal entrance length are given
by xh = 0.05ReD and xt = 0.05RePrD,33−37 respectively. It should be noted that a 1 m length pipe was sufficient
for a flow to be considered hydrodynamically developed, but the same
cannot be said of its thermal layer. In both DES and NDDES, at the
entrance of the pipe, the heat transfer coefficient is very large
due to which the boundary layer thickness is very small. It is found
that the boundary layer thickness starts increasing while the heat
transfer coefficient decreases along the pipe length. An appreciable
increase in the coefficient of heat transfer was attributed to the
increased thermophysical properties of DES nanofluids and a delay
in the development of the boundary layer in the entrance areas. This
behavior indicates that measures could be taken such as creating “artificial
entrance” regions along a pipeline to maximize the performance
of these novel nanofluids. The flow is not thermally developed as
the value of Prandtl number is large for both DES and NDDES fluids.

Overall, the thermal entrance length of the nanofluid flows had
a longer length scale when compared to only DES flow. The enhancement
of the local heat transfer coefficient was higher in magnitude when
compared to the increase in the effective thermal conductivity within
the test section. Thus, the use of NDDES nanofluids significantly
improves the convective heat transfer, particularly at the entrance
region. This may be due to the particle migration resulting in a non-uniform
distribution of both thermal conductivity and viscosity, which eventually
reduces the thermal boundary layer thickness. The benefit of NDDESs
as a heat transfer fluid shall be determined based on the consideration
between the increase in heat transfer performance and the increase
in pumping power. Further, the stability of nanoparticles is another
concern. Their agglomeration ability is a critical problem faced in
the practical application of nanofluids. This affects the properties
of nanofluids and impacts the heat transfer performance of nanofluids.
The agglomerates can have various sizes and configurations depending
primarily on the elapsed time. They can invariably affect the thermal
conductivity of nanofluids. This agglomeration may also be due to
the nanofluid preparation and the experimental study time along with
different time durations of the experimental study. However, the use
of surfactants can increase their stability. In some of the earlier
reported work,31,32 these may be reached under low
pH conditions, thereby making nanofluids difficult in many application
systems.

3 Conclusions
Heat
transfer fluid based on deep eutectic solvents was synthesized using
a hydrogen bond donor (i.e., oleic acid) and a hydrogen bond acceptor
(i.e., dl-menthol). An equimolar ratio of hydrogen bond donor
(HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) was predicted by COSMO-SAC
predictions, and the same equimolar ratio was used in the synthesis of DESs. Thereafter, NDDESs were prepared
with four different Al2O3 at different concentrations
(0.001, 0.005 0.0075, and 0.01 volume fraction) in the base DES solvent.
By measuring their thermophysical properties, flow regime, and agglomeration
behavior, NDDESs at a volume fraction of 0.005 were chosen as an optimum
choice. Both the DESs and NDDESs were found to be of Newtonian in
behavior at all temperatures of the measurement. The model prediction
for viscosity agreed well with experimental values at a low volume
fraction of nanoparticles. When compared to DESs, the enhancement
in the viscosity of NDDES was 96% higher at a 0.005 volume fraction
of nanoparticles. The thermal conductivity and heat capacity enhancement
was 24% and 50% higher, respectively, at a 0.005 volume fraction of
nanoparticles. Thereafter, forced convection experiments were carried
out in the laminar regime. An appreciable increase in the coefficient
of heat transfer was attributed to the increased thermophysical properties
of DES nanofluids and a delay in the development of the boundary layer
in the entrance areas. This behavior indicates that measures could
be taken such as creating “artificial entrance” regions
along a pipeline to maximize the performance of these novel nanofluids.
In the penultimate section, numerical modeling using COMSOL was also
carried out to validate the heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt
number.

4 Computational Details
DESs are synthesized
due to primary hydrogen bonds between a hydrogen bond donor (HBD)
and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA). This renders a new chemical entity
with a melting point lower than those of the initial compounds. It
should also be noted that not all ratios of HBD and HBA will give
us a eutectic point or a liquid phase. It is those points or, in other
words, the lowest temperature that needs to be computed in such a
manner that a liquid phase of DES coexist. This can be initiated through
quantum chemical calculations and then adopting a statistical-based
approach. Hence, the COSMO-SAC (conductor-like screening model–segment
activity coefficient model) is adopted. The detailed methodology of
COSMO and COSMO-SAC is already available in our earlier work.38,39 The applications of COSMO-SAC are well known and documented in areas
such as distillation, extraction, and absorption. Once the optimum
ratio is known, we shall then proceed to the synthesis.

The
procedure starts with the geometry optimization followed by COSMO-SAC
predictions. The geometry optimization on all the structures was carried
out using the density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP along the optimized
structure with SDD basis set. The COSMO file was generated by the
BVP86/TZVP/DFT level of theory.38 Gaussian
0940 was used to generate the above procedure
or also termed as COSMO file initiation. The global adjustable parameters
for generating the activity coefficient via a statistical mechanical
framework were the surface area of the segment (aeff = 6.32 Å2), the misfit energy interaction
constant [α′ = 8419 kcal Å4/(mol e2)], the cutoff for hydrogen-bonding interaction (σHB = 0.0084 e/Å2), and the hydrogen-bonding
interaction constant [cHB = 75,006 kcal
Å4/(mol e2)]. Thereafter, the mole fraction
was predicted for both HBD and HBA by the activity coefficient in
either phase at different temperatures (T) (eq 6) 6  where γsolute, xsolute, ΔHf, and Tm are the
activity coefficient, the mole fraction, the enthalpy of fusion, and
the melting point, respectively. The solute here refers to dl-menthol (Figure 11) as it has the lower boiling point. Figure 12 shows the solid–liquid equilibrium
diagram for mixtures of dl-menthol with oleic acid as a function
of composition. It is found that a eutectic mixture of dl-menthol and oleic acid is formed at a molar ratio of 0.41:0.59 and
a temperature of 270 K. Thus, based on the COSMO-SAC predictions of
the eutectic point, the appropriate molar ratio of HBA/HBD is 0.59/0.41
= 1.4. This corresponds to the actual molar ratio of dl-menthol/oleic
acid, respectively. However, we have adopted 1:1 as decreasing the
mole fraction of menthol (Figure 12) did not alter the liquid phase of the eutectic mixture.
With the obtained ratio (i.e., 1:1), we shall now discuss the synthesis
procedure in the ensuing section.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Materials
dl-Menthol having a purity of 95% was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Figure 11). Oleic
acid having a purity of >90% was supplied by Otto Chemie Pvt. Ltd.
(Figure 11). Aluminum
oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles having
a particle size of 50 nm as measured by TEM were bought from Sigma-Aldrich.
DMSO-d6 was used as the NMR solvent and
supplied by Merck (Germany). The chemicals were used without further
purification. The densities of the chemicals were measured by an Anton
Paar density meter (DMA 4500 M) for comparison with the manufacturer’s
specification. The measured densities were within ±1%. The viscosities
were also measured by an Anton Paar interfacial rheometer (Physica
MCR301). The measured viscosities were of ±1% with literature
values.

5.2 Experimental Details
5.2.1 Synthesis
of DESs and NDDESs
To synthesize the DESs, an equimolar ratio
of dl-menthol as HBA and oleic acid as HBD was taken. Both
HBD and HBA were added to a flat-bottom flask, which was fitted with
a reflux condenser. It was then kept for 12–24 h at 343.15
K with continuous stirring until a clear homogenous liquid was formed.
The clear liquid or the DESs were then placed at room temperature
(298.15 K) overnight. To confirm the composition of the DESs, 1H NMR (Figure 13) were recorded and compared with the 1H NMR of the individual
pure component. No new peaks were observed upon mixing the two, implying
that there were no reactions between the starting materials. Further,
the melting point of the synthesized DESs was measured as 266.15 K
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC1, Mettler Toledo, Germany),
while the individual melting points of dl-menthol and oleic
acid are 307.15 and 286.15 K, respectively. This also agrees well
with the obtained melting point from COSMO-SAC predictions (270 K)
as given in Figure 12.

Figure 13 1H NMR analysis of pure dl-menthol, oleic acid,
and DESs.

To the synthesized DESs, an appropriate
volume fraction of alumina nanoparticles (0.001, 0.005, 0.0075, and
0.01 vol %) was added, which gave us the NDDESs. Nanofluids having the nanoparticles were initially mixed through
a vortex mixture (SPINIX MC-01, Tarsons). One of the primary objectives in the Al2O3 nanofluid is to obtain a homogenous and uniform suspension of nanoparticles.
This usually occurs by the minimization of agglomerated nanoparticles.
To prevent any possible agglomeration, ultrasonication (GT-1990QTS,
ANTECH) was applied for 60 min to get a homogenous distribution of
nanoparticles. To confirm the particle suspension behavior of the
nanofluid, the zeta potential is considered to be an important parameter.
The agglomeration of suspended particles primarily occurs due to the
higher surface energy, which leads to precipitation. This was confirmed
through the zeta potential measurement of nanofluids by Delsa Nano
(Delsa Nano C, BECKMAN COULTER).

According to Vandsburger,41 when the zeta potential is close to
±30 mV, the nanofluids are expected to be moderately stable.
If the zeta potential is near ±45 mV, then the stability of nanofluids
is guaranteed. The zeta potential value above ±60 mV illustrates
an excellent stability of the nanofluid system. The zeta potential
of 0.005 vol % Al2O3 nanofluid was found to
be 96.51 mV, which indicates an excellent stability of nanofluid and
is also likely to possess lower chances of settlement. It is a known
fact that the suspension has a potential electrostatic stability due
to the strong repulsive forces within the charged particles. This
reduces the probability of coalescence, leading to a stable suspension
in DESs. The stability of the nanoparticles was also analyzed by measuring
the particle sizes using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique
(Delsa Nano C, BECKMAN COULTER). The measurements were conducted for
1 week with six measurements taken each day. Further, each measurement
was also performed in triplicate. The values obtained (±200 nm)
are clearly higher than the nominal sizes as per the manufacturer’s
specification (i.e., 70 nm). However, it should be noted that with
the DLS technique, the obtained size is the hydrodynamic diameter,
which inherently is the sum of the particle diameter and the Debye
length. This explains a higher size than the real particle size. The
Debye length is the measure of the charge carrier net electrostatic
effect in solution or DESs. It is also termed as the thickness of
the diffuse layer that moves with the alumina nanoparticle within
the DES eutectic mixture. The behavior of the nanofluids was found
to be similar, i.e., the particle size increased for a few hours after
which time it was considered to remain stable. We did not observe
sizes greater than ±200 nm. It suggests that the alumina nanoparticles
in DESs agglomerate in a few hours and forms a complex with an internal
structure where it then remains stable.

5.2.2 Measurement
of Thermophysical Properties
To ascertain the thermal stability,
TGA (TG209 F1, Libra, NETZSCH, Germany) was performed for both DESs
and NDDESs under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C
per minute. From the TGA data, it can be seen that the thermal stability
of both DESs and NDDESs was almost similar and close to 110 °C
for a 10% mass loss (Figure 14). Thereafter, the measurement of thermophysical properties
such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat
capacity20,21 was conducted. While the heat capacity indicates
the energy storage capacity of DESs and NDDESs in the CSP system,
viscosity provides the required pumping power for both DESs and NDDESs.
In a similar analogy, the thermal conductivity shall indicate heat
conductance properties.

Figure 14 TGA analysis of DESs and NDDESs.

The densities of DESs and NDDESs were measured
by the Anton Paar density meter (DMA 4500 M) in the temperature range
of 293.15–423.15 K. The principle used for this measurement
is the oscillating U-tube method. The sample was injected into the
U-shaped borosilicate glass tube that oscillates at its characteristic
frequency, which is directly related to the density of the sample.
The viscosity of DES and NDDES was measured by the Anton Paar interfacial
rheometer (Physica MCR301) as a function of temperature in the range
of 298.15–423.15 K.

The thermal conductivities of both
DESs and NDDESs were measured using a KD2 Pro thermal property analyzer
(Decagon Device, USA). The principle of measurement is based on the
hot-wire method. The device has a probe termed “KS-1”
having dimensions of 60 mm in length and 1.3 mm in diameter, which
was inserted vertically into the test sample. For controlling and
conducting the measurements, the probe is connected to a microcontroller.
The meter was calibrated with standard glycerin. A thermal bath was
used to maintain the constant temperature of the measuring sample.
The temperature accuracy of the bath was within ±273.18 K. The
experiment was performed with a temperature range of 298.15–373.15
K. The heat capacity of both DESs and NDDESs was measured using a
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC1, Mettler Toledo, Germany).
The specific heat capacity was measured from 308.15 to 423.15 K.

5.2.3 Forced Convection Experimental Setup and Data
Processing
Figure 15 represents the schematic diagram of the
forced convection setup used in this experiment. The setup comprises
a test section, a magnetic pump, a rotameter, a storage tank, and
a condenser. The test section is equipped with seven thermocouples
and two pressure transducers. The pump (Taha PMD 15) was connected
to a flow control valve followed by a rotameter (Apex 10LPM) to measure
the flow rate. The test section was wrapped by flexible heating tape
(Brisk Heat) to maintain a uniform heat flux throughout the test section.
A DC power supply (GATTS MX1174A) ensured a power output to the heater.
To lower the heat loss and attain a constant heat flux condition,
fiberglass insulation was used for the entire test section. A total
of five J-type thermocouples were inserted on the surface of the test
section. Two more J-type thermocouples were welded at the inlet and
outlet of the test section to measure the inlet and exit liquid temperatures.
To measure the pressure drop along the test section, two pressure
transducers were connected at the inlet and outlet. The material of
construction of the test section was a stainless steel (SS-316) tube
of 9 mm in inner diameter, 12 mm in outer diameter, and 1000 mm in
length. All thermocouples (±2 °C) and pressure transducers
(±0.2mV) were connected to a National Instrument (NI) data acquisition
system (cDAQ-9178). It consisted of a temperature card (namely, NI
9211) and a pressure card (NI 9203), which were then interfaced with
a computer. The LabVIEW software was used for data processing.

Figure 15 Schematic
of forced convection experimental setup.

For a better experimental result, the entire test section
was run by deionized water. After putting the DESs in the tank, the
pump was started and the desired flow rate was maintained by a control
valve and a rotameter. After reaching the steady state, the temperatures
at designated points of the test section were recorded through the
LabVIEW software. After recording the data, the flow rate was varied
in an ascending manner. This was repeated up until the maximum flow
rate of the pump was reached. Thereafter, the forced convection study
of DESs and NDDESs at a volume fraction of 0.005 was performed. Figure 5 displays the circular
test section and the flow loop used in the heat transfer performance
of DES and NDDES experiments. The experimental setup consists of an
NDDES tank, a pump, a test section, a heat exchanger, a thermocouple,
and a digital manometer. The test section used was as a circular stainless
steel tube of 9 mm in inner diameter, 12 mm in outer diameter, and
1000 mm in length. A constant heat flux boundary condition was used.
The heat flux (q) was measured from the heater input
power (Q) and heating surface area (A) using the following equation 7  where d0 is the tube outer diameter and l is the testing section (heating) length, while V and I are the input voltage and current,
respectively. The local heat transfer coefficient along the test section, h(x), has been calculated using the following
equation 8  where Tw′(x) and Tf′(x) are
the local temperatures of the inner surface and bulk liquid, respectively.
The inner surface temperature was computed with the one-dimensional
steady-state heat conduction equation having a constant heat flux
boundary condition. The inner surface temperature is given below 9  where TW(x) is the local temperature of the outer
surface as interfaced by the thermocouples, ro and ri are the outer and inner
radius of the test tube, respectively, and ks is the thermal conductivity of the pipe. In a similar manner,
the bulk mean temperature of the liquid can be computed from the energy
balance relation 10  where Tf is
the liquid inlet temperature of the test section, Cp is the specific heat capacity of the liquid, and V′ is the volumetric flow rate. All fluid properties
have been evaluated at the average temperature (Tav = (Tin + Tout)/2), i.e., the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures
of the test section.

5.2.4 COMSOL Simulations
The development of flow through a pipe in the laminar flow regime
is depicted in Figure 16. This has been used for the numerical modeling studies using COMSOL
(version 5.2a). For COMSOL, the continuity equation is written in
the vector form as 11  The equation of motion for an incompressible fluid
in vector form is then written as 12  The first two terms on the left-hand side signify the inertia term,
while the first term on the right-hand side represents the pressure
gradient. The second term on the right-hand side represents the diffusion
term, while the last term is the body force term. In a similar manner,
the equation of energy takes the form as given below: 13   14  The first two terms in the energy equation
represents the accumulation term and convection term, respectively,
while the last term is due to heat conduction. On a similar note,
the first term on the right side of eq 13 represents the heat source terms, while the second
term denotes the viscous heat dissipation term.
