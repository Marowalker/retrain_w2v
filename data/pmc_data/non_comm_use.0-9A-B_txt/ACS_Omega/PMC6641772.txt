Cryptochromes
are flavoproteins whose photochemistry is important
for crucial functions associated with phototropism and circadian clocks.
In this report, we, for the first time, observed a magnetic response
of the cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) immobilized at a gold electrode with
illumination of blue light. These results present the magnetic field-enhanced
photoinduced electron transfer of CRY1 to the electrode by voltammetry,
exhibiting magnetic responsive rate constant and electrical current
changes. A mechanism of the electron transfer, which involves photoinduced
radicals in the CRY, is sensitive to the weak magnetic field; and
the long-lived free radical FAD•– is responsible
for the detected electrochemical Faradaic current. As a photoreceptor,
the finding of a 5.7% rate constant change in electron transfer corresponding
to a 50 μT magnetic field may be meaningful in regulation of
magnetic field signaling and circadian clock function under an electromagnetic
field.

Introduction
Cryptochromes (CRYs)
are a class of flavoproteins as photoreceptors
with the cryptic nature for a long time.1 A CRY, as a photoactive pigment, was first discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana(2) and Sinapis alba(3) and has
high sequence homology to photolyase.4 CRYs
have no photolyase activity for DNA repair,5 though CRYs and photolyases belong to the same family of flavoproteins
with high sequence identity.5−7 Later, they were also identified
to function as blue-light photoreceptors in insects for synchronizing
the circadian clock.8−10

CRYs and photolyases have similar three-dimensional
structures.11 Most CRYs, like all the flavoproteins
superfamily,
are composed of two domains, an amino (N)-terminal photolyase-related
(PHR) region and a carboxy (C)-terminal domain of varying sizes.12 The N-terminal PHR domain can noncovalently
bind to a single molecule of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
cofactor and a light-harvesting chromophore.13 The second chromophore can be either pterin or deazaflavin.5,14 The C-terminal domain is less conserved than the PHR domain. The
structure of the CRY1 protein is primarily made up of alpha helices
with a few loops and beta sheets. The PHR region has two domains,
the α/β domain and a helical domain, which are connected
by a variable loop that wraps around the α/β domain. The
α/β domain adopts a dinucleotide-binding fold with five-strand
parallel β sheets flanked on either side by α helices.
Two lobes of the helical domain form a cavity called the FAD-access
cavity.12 FAD is buried deeply inside the
FAD-access cavity, but it may be accessible to the solvent from the
bottom of the cavity. FAD noncovalently binds to the protein in a
U-shaped conformation, with its adenine and isoalloxazine rings positioned
at the bottom of the cavity. Different from photolyase, which is generally
positively charged, the surface of CRY1 PHR is predominantly negatively
charged, except for a small concentration of positive charges near
the FAD-access cavity.13

CRYs, as
blue light photoreceptors, have a variety of known functions
including phototropism, circadian rhythms, and light-dependent regulation
of plant growth and development.15 CRYs
have also been proposed as candidate magnetoreceptors.16 Over half a century, many researchers have reported
that plants17−19 and animals20−22 (insects, sea turtles, spotted
newts, lobsters, honeybees, European robins, etc.) have the ability
to perceive magnetic fields to direct their biological clock, circadian
rhythms, and orientation behaviors because of the photoactive magnetoreception
role of CRYs. However, the biophysical and chemical basis of the magnetic
sense remains elusive.

Magnetoreception of CRYs has been explained
by a radical-pair-based
mechanism.16,23 The magnetic sensitivity arises
from chemical intermediates formed by photoexcitation of cryptochrome
proteins.24,25 Although the light-induced photocycle in
cryptochromes and magnetic field effects in active states of cryptochromes
have been examined through transient absorption and electron-spin-resonance
observations together with the concept and methods of quantum physics
and molecular dynamics,26−29 the magnetic field-associated electron transfer is
less explored.30,31 More recently, theoretical and
spectroscopic studies32−35 suggest that electron transfer between light-activated FAD and tryptophan
(Trp) residues leads to the formation of a spin-correlated radical
pair, whose subsequent chemical reactions are sensitive to external
magnetic fields. This is because hyperfine coupling (HFC) interactions
between an electron spin and a nuclear spin cause the interconversion
between the singlet and triplet states of the radical pair, and its
dynamics is modulated by an external weak magnetic field. Anisotropies
of HFC play a key role in sensing the direction of the magnetic field.
In more detail, when a cryptochrome is activated with light, the interconversion
of radical pairs of singlet 1[FAD•– TrpH•+] and triplet 3[FAD•– TrpH•+] states is critical in determining the
response to an external magnetic field.25 The 1[FAD•– TrpH•+] can either return to the ground state FAD and TrpH, or singlet
and triplet radical pairs can interconvert and react to generate radicals
with uncorrelated electron spins. The fraction of remaining radical
pairs and the yield of free radicals depend on the direction/strength
of the external magnetic field. This explains the origin of the magnetic
field effect. To get a sufficient amount of free radicals, the spin
coherence of radical pairs should persist for at least the Larmor
period (700 ns for a 50 μT field, the strength for earth’s
magnetic field).36 While the oscillations
in the spin state of a radical pair are crucial for sensing the existence
of an external magnetic field, the product of free radicals stores
the magnetic information regarding the magnetic field (e.g., direction
and strength) once all radical pairs have disappeared.25 However, how the protein proceeds to signal
the stored information is an unrevealed mystery.

To date, the
heterogeneous electron transfer of cryptochromes has
not been reported. This is especially true for the magnetic sensitivity
of CRYs at a solid interface, which would be of great interest for
exploring the associated protein signaling of magnetic information
stored in the long-lived free radicals, that is, FAD•– and TrpH•+. The free radicals have been proven
to return to their resting states by independent redox reactions,34,37,38 which can potentially be probed
by electrochemical means. In addition, the mechanistic structure–function
relationship of the CRYs regarding the electron transfer might be
examined in a similar way. The hypothesis is that if the electron
transfer of the free radicals can be probed with an electrode and
examined with respect to an external magnetic field, it could provide
an alternative way to investigate and regulate the aspects of magnetic
sensing and signaling of the protein.

Cryptochromes play a role
in entraining the circadian clock to
its environment, circadian photoreceptor,39,40 and the magnetoreception when excited to form the radical pair.41 Here, we, for the first time, report magnetic
responses by a cyclic voltammetry analysis of the magnetic field effect
on the light-induced electron transfer of immobilized cryptochrome
1 (photolyase-like CRY1, MW of 66.2 kDa, Figure S1) on a gold slide. The CRY1 can absorb light at wavelengths
ranging from 280 to 500 nm (Figure S2),
suggesting its FAD photoreception.42 The
CRY1 is immobilized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of mixed
−S–(CH2)10–COOH and −S–(CH2)8–OH.43 The
photoactivated CRY1s at the electrode show a strong response in Faradaic
current of cyclic voltammetry and the calculated heterogeneous electron
transfer rate constant, even to weak external magnetic field flux
intensities (0–1.32 mT).

Results and Discussion
Immobilization
of CRY1
The surface amino residues at
the N-terminal PHR domain favor the cross-link reaction with the activated
−COOH, which may enable oriented immobilization of CYR1, at
least to some extent (Figure 1). The covalent bonds anchoring the protein should eliminate
a gating mechanism for electron transfer of the protein at the surface,
resulting from a large conformational motion.44 While the radical pair model suggests that the proteins would have
to be both immobilized and aligned to show anisotropic magnetic responses,
the requirement of mutual alignment may not be very strict.16,45,46 In addition, a small concentration
of positive charges near the FAD-access cavity13 may help to stabilize the conformation of the protein at
the gold surface and limit the molecular motion due to the electrostatic
force with the negatively charged SAM, making the electron exchange
between the FAD complex and a gold electrode possible.

for the SAM formation and CRY1s immobilization
on the gold slide electrode and a schematic of the home-setup, optomagnetic
electrochemical system used for the electrochemical study of the immobilized
CRY1s with a blue light illumination.

Cyclic Voltammetry of Immobilized CRY1s
The stabilized
CRY1–SAM–gold electrode was used for the electrochemical
testing with respect to the magnetic field and light illumination. Figure 2A shows representative
oxidation voltammograms (baseline subtracted from original cyclic
voltammograms in Figure S3) of adsorbed
CRY1 films with and without blue light excitation at a scan rate of
4 V s–1. CRY1 is known to be activated by light,
and no Faradaic signal was observed in the absence of blue light illumination.
Upon illumination with blue light, an oxidation peak was observed
from the CRY1–SAM–gold electrode. The peak current increased
monotonically with increasing magnetic field strength. There is no
measurable Faradaic current from the CRY1s–SAM–gold
slide electrode without light illumination (Figure S4) or the SAM-only gold slide electrode without CRY1s immobilized
(Figures S5 and S6) at different magnetic
fields. This is evidence that the changes of oxidation peak current
from the CRY1s–SAM–gold slide at different magnetic
fields (Figures S7 and S8) result from concurrence of blue light excitation and magnetic
field effects on CRY1s (see more in the Methods Section for control experiments).

Figure 2 (A) Cyclic voltammograms for the gold
slide surface immobilized
with CRY1 with and without blue light excitation in the absence of
the magnetic field and with blue light excitation under different
magnetic fields at the scan rate of 4 V s–1. (B)
Time profiles for the surface concentration of immobilized CRY1 with
blue light excitation at the scan rate of 4 V s–1 in the absence of the magnetic field.

Association strength and stability of the adsorbed CRY1 films
were
assessed by voltammograms. This was performed using the same CRY1s–SAM–gold
electrode at subsequent times. In this procedure, the electrode was
placed in the supporting electrolyte solution, and after 20 s, a voltammogram
was initiated with a scan rate of 4 V s–1. Voltammograms
were performed at subsequent time points (each measurement with light
excitation but in the absence of the magnetic field) until the peak
current was found to stabilize. The peak current is proportional to
the amount of CRY1 adsorbed on the surface. Thus, Figure 2B shows a profile of the adsorbed
species concentration as a function of time. The peak current is found
to stabilize after 110 min, and 91.3 ± 0.2% of the initial amount
of CRY1 adsorbed on the surface is maintained after 120 min, indicating
good stability of immobilized CRY1 at the gold slide surface.

Magnetic
Response of Photoactivated CRY1
During cyclic
voltammetry, the peak current, ip, displays
as a function of the voltage scan rate, ν, for the stabilized
CRY1–SAM–gold electrodes in an external magnetic field.
Specifically, the magnitude of the peak current was found to increase
linearly with the scan rate, which is consistent with the redox reaction
of immobilized species at electrode surfaces.47 The data in Figure 2A show that the oxidation peak potential shifts to lower values with
the increasing magnetic field, and the data in Figure 3A show that the slope of the peak current
versus scan rate plot (Table S1) increases
more strongly at higher magnetic fields, suggesting that the electron
transfer rate increases with the increase of the magnetic field strength.47

Figure 3 (A) Linear dependence of the peak current on the voltage
scan rate
under different magnetic fields. (B) Dependence of the peak potential
on log(scan rate, ν) under different magnetic fields and fits
of the data to the extended Marcus model for electron transfer (at
λ = 0.8 eV). Note that the scan rates (ν) are 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 V s–1.

The dependence of the oxidation peak’s position on
the voltage
scan rate can be used to extract an electron transfer rate constant.48−50 The electron transfer between an immobilized, electroactive reporter,
such as CRY1, and an electrode can be written as 1  where the excited CRY1* is the electron
donor
and the electrode is the electron acceptor during the oxidation reaction.
In electrochemistry, the rate constant, kox, is subject to the overpotential, η. On the basis of the extended
Marcus theory for heterogeneous electron transfer,48−50 the standard
heterogeneous rate constant (k0), that
is, the rate constant at η = 0, can be expressed as (see details
in the Supporting Information) 2  in which, ℏ is the
Planck constant, HDA is the effective
electronic coupling between the electrode and the CRY1 states, λ
is the reorganization energy, kB is Boltzmann’s
constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, ρ(ε)
is the electronic density of states of the electrode, f(ε) is the Fermi function, εF is the Fermi
energy, and ε is the energy of an electronic state in the electrode.

Fitting of the Faradaic peak potential shifts from the formal potential
as a function of the scan rate, log(ν), was used to obtain k0 values for the electron transfer rate constant
of the CRY1 immobilized on the gold slide (see details in the Supporting Information). Figure 3B shows a plot of the peak shift versus the
voltage scan rate under different magnetic fields (Table S2), along with a best fit of the electron transfer
rate constant with a typical reorganization energy of 0.8 eV for FAD
proteins.51 For example, in the absence
of an external magnetic field, the standard heterogeneous rate constant
for the light-excited CRY1s–SAM–gold slide system is
calculated to be 13 s–1. In the presence of an external
magnetic field, the standard rate constant increases by approximately
15, 38, 77, 131, 200, and 277% at 0.22, 0.44, 0.66, 0.88, 1.10, and
1.32 mT magnetic field, respectively, compared to the k0 without a magnetic field (Table 1).

The electrochemical electron transfer
kinetics was also analyzed
by using the Laviron formalism based on the classical Butler–Volmer
theory as52 3  where α is the transfer coefficient
(0.5), F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and νi is the intercept of
the linear regions in the plot of peak potential shift versus log(ν)
(Figure S9). The electron transfer rate
constant values are reported in Table 1, the order of which is well-consistent with that calculated
by the extended Marcus theory under magnetic fields. However, because
of the nonlinear correlation of the peak potential versus log(ν)
over the range of the voltammetric scan rates, the extended Marcus
model provides a better fit for the rate constant estimation.

The electrochemical electron transfer mechanism and magnetic responses
are discussed in combination with the well-established radical pair
mechanism as follows. Homo sapiens CRY1 was reported to confer light-independent
biological activity; however, it could be stimulated by light into
a flavin-based radical pair.41 According
to the photocycle reaction scheme for CRYs from homogeneous studies,25,30,32,34,38,53 the CRY1 is
first photoexcited from the fully oxidized form of the noncovalently
bound FAD cofactor (FADox) to produce an excited singlet
state (1FAD*). The 1FAD* is rapidly reduced
by electron transfer along a chain of three Trp residues within the
protein to form the radical pair 1[FAD•– TrpH•+]. The radical pair contains the spin-correlated
singlet state of the two unpaired electron spins, one on each radical.
The 1[FAD•– TrpH•+] radical pair then undergoes either an interconversion of singlet-triplet
states between 1[FAD•– TrpH•+] and 3[FAD•– TrpH•+] (named RP1), which are magnetically sensitive, or
a spin-independent (de) protonation of one or both of the radicals
(i.e., FAD•– → FADH• and/or TrpH•+ → Trp•)
to give a long-lived, magnetic-insensitive secondary radical pair
in the forms of [FADH• TrpH•+],
[FAD•– Trp•], or [FADH• TrpH•] (RP2). Meanwhile, the 1[FAD•– TrpH•+]
proceeds with spin-allowed reverse electron transfer to regenerate
the ground oxidation state (FADox + TrpH).53 The time scale of singlet 1[FAD•– TrpH•+] to the ground oxidation state (FADox + TrpH) or from RP1 to RP2 is in the μs range, whereas
the RP2 has a longer lifetime on the order of milliseconds. The radicals
in RP2 then turn back to their respective ground states by two independent
slow redox reactions at the time scale of ms (kF and kD in Figure 4).32 The slow
radical termination reactions are one of the key steps to lead to
a significant amplification of the effects of weak magnetic fields
on FAD-containing radical pairs under conditions of continuous photoexcitation.32,37,54

Figure 4 Proposed electrochemical reaction and
electron transfer pathways
of CRY1 immobilized at the gold electrode based on the photocycle
scheme of CRYs and the magnetic sensitive radical pair mechanism.

Assuming that the CRY1 follows
the radical pair mechanism of cryptochromes
for its magnetic field effect, a hypothesized photoinduced electron
reaction diagram at the electrode is proposed and depicted in Figure 4. Because the FADox is embedded in the protein and undergoes fast light excitation
(femto-picosecond), there is little FADox available for
the reduction reaction from the ground states of FADox by
cyclic voltammetry.55 When the FAD is excited
to be FAD*, which is rapidly converted to radical pairs (picosecond),25,30 the electron transfer between FAD* and the electrode is unlikely
to ensue. According to the existing forms of the radical pair, the
possible electron transfer reactions between the photoactivated radicals
and the electrode are proposed to be 4   5   6   7  

Because of the short time scale (μs) of relaxation processes
from 1[FAD•– TrpH•+] to the ground state (FADox + TrpH) and the rate of RP1
to RP2,53 it is unlikely that the process
represented by eq 4 or 5 is detectable in the scan rate of the cyclic voltammetry
in this study. Hence, eq 6 is probably the electron transfer reaction corresponding to the
oxidative Faradaic current in the photoinduced electrochemistry of
the immobilized CRY1s because of the slow (∼ms) relaxation
reaction of RP2 to the ground state (FADox + TrpH). However,
it should not be a direct electron transfer from FAD because of the
depth of embedment within the protein. This has happened on FAD in
glucose oxidase when immobilized through the SAM bridge at a gold
electrode.55 Instead, the oxidative electron
transfer could be mediated by the conserved triad of Trp residues35,38,56−58 or by tunneling
through surrounding residues, such as the α-helix (α-15)
between residues D358 and the phenyl ring of F366,31,59 to the gold electrode. This peak is also unlikely to be the oxidation
of the ground state of FAD because the potential of direct oxidation
of FAD in enzymes is normally at more negative potentials.51,55,60 The radical cation TrpH•+ in RP2 is probably functioning as an acceptor of the electron from
the gold electrode (eq 7); however, it is not observed in the cyclic voltammograms. Its reduction
potential may lie outside the CV scan voltage window because the reduction
potential of free L-Trp is larger than 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl in cyclic
voltammetry.61

Sensitivity to Magnetic
Field
The electrochemical measurements
in this work were operated by maintaining gold slide electrodes in
the same orientation at the same position located at center of the
Helmholtz coil. Hence, the results should be comparable. The correlation
of the Faradaic current and electron transfer rate constant to the
external magnetic field is shown in Figure 5. The peak current has a linear dependence
on the magnetic field strength (Figures 5A and S10) with
an increasing magnitude of the Faradaic current at a higher field
strength. Likewise, the ratio of the rate constant increases superlinearly
with the magnetic field strength (Figure 5B shows a log plot). For every 50 μT
increase (equivalent to earth’s magnetic field strength), the
calculated rate constant increases 5.7% (Marcus fit).

Figure 5 Magnetic sensitivity
of (A) peak current (at 4 V s–1 scan rate) vs field
strength and (B) plot of ln(km/k0) vs field strength for
the gold slide surface immobilized with CRY1 under blue light excitation
with a linear fit. Note that km and k0 are the calculated rate constant k0 values in the presence and absence of magnetic fields,
respectively.

There is a competition
of electron transfer of eq 6 and the kF of FAD•− to ground-state FADox. A spectroscopic study37 shows
that the rate constant of the kF in Figure 4 has a value of the
same order as the electron transfer rate constant reported here, supporting
the hypothesis that the reaction eq 6 is electrochemically detectable. A weak external magnetic
field (1.32 mT or less) favors the formation of RP2 with a longer
life time,31,53 resulting in more FAD•– involved in the oxidation reaction eq 6. This accounts for the Faradaic current increase with
an increased magnetic field.

The next question is why the electron
transfer rate constant of
the photoactivated CRY1 is sensitive to the weak external magnetic
field. The radical pair mechanism predicts that extremely small magnetic
interactions can very likely significantly affect the outcome of radical-pair
reaction, for example, the RP1 generation and states of the photoactivated
CRY1.25 Though the RP2 state of protein
does not actively generate or produce magnetic field effects because
the spin correlation from RP1 should relax before RP2 recombines,
the long-lived RP2 protein containing free radical FAD•– inherits the magnetic field effect/information, being stabilized
by reduction of Trp• radicals, and is assumed to
be responsible for signaling.25,34 Therefore, the 5.7%
change in the rate constant of the free radical FAD•– of RP2 per 50 μT may be associated with
the magnetoreception signaling process.

Conclusions
This
work demonstrates that external magnetic fields can induce
changes in the electron transfer rate from the radicals to the edge
of the immobilized CRY1, as well as the magnitude of the electrical
signal; it may open a new avenue to studies of the signaling of the
photoreceptors and offer promise for the development of a biomimetic
optomagneto compass. The significance and the merit of the current
work are twofold. This work shows that electrochemistry can be used
to investigate the surface-immobilized cryptochromes for magnetic
sensing and responses by measuring the heterogeneous electron transfer.
The electrode functions as a probe to detect the electrical signal
generated from photoactivated cryptochromes under the magnetic field.
Scientifically, the results suggest that photoinduced radicals in
FAD-bound CRY1 is sensitive to the weak magnetic field, and the long-lived
free radical FAD•– is proposed to be responsible
for the detected electrochemical Faradaic current because of its oxidation.
This is supported by the measured electron transfer constant from
the FAD•– in CRY1 which is comparable to
the resting rate of the free radical to the ground oxidation state
by the homogeneous spectroscopic study. For the photolyase-like photoreceptor,
a 5.7% rate constant change in electron transfer reaction corresponding
to a 50 μT magnetic field (equivalent to earth magnetic field)
may be associated with the protein-signaling process.

Methods
CRY1 Characterization
Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy
(UV–vis spectroscopy, Varian Cary 6000i) over the spectral
range of 280–600 nm was used to investigate the absorbance
properties of the photolyase-like CRY1 (Novus Biologicals, cat.# NBL1-09495,
licensed from OriGene Technologies), and the CRY1 proteins were created
in HEK293T cells, using plasmid ID RC207152 and based on accession
number NM_004075. The protein contains a C-terminal DDK tag. The gene encodes a FAD-binding
protein that is a key component of the circadian core oscillator complex.
The proteins extracted with exact buffer (0.125 M Tris, 1% SDS, 10%
glycerol, 0.05 M sodium metabisulfite) and purified by amylose affinity
chromatography as described previously.14 The UV–vis measurement was conducted in a solution of 50
mM Tris buffer containing 500 mM NaCl under pH = 8.

Preparation
of Immobilized CRY1 onto the Gold Slide Electrode
Surface
The gold coated slides contained 20 nm of Au deposited
on a 11.5 mm × 11.5 mm glass slide (surface area of 1.32 cm2) by physical vapor deposition (Kurt Lesker PVD75 E-Beam Evaporator
System). Gold slides were first cleaned with O2 plasma
(South Bay Technologies PC2000 Plasma Cleaner) for 3 min. The slides
were then incubated in a mixture of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (HS(CH2)10COOH, Sigma-Aldrich) and 8-mercapto-octanol
(HS(CH2)8OH, Sigma-Aldrich) in an absolute ethanol
solution (ACROS Organics) with a 1:2 mole ratio overnight to form
a SAM. After SAM formation, the gold slides were incubated in a 10
mM PBS solution with 0.5 mM 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC, TCI)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS,
Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h to activate the carboxylic acid groups. Next,
the gold slide was rinsed with 10 mM PBS solution and immediately
moved to a freshly prepared 10 mM PBS solution containing 1 mg/mL
of CRY1 for 2 h in a black box. This was followed by dipping 10 min
in a 0.2 M glycine PBS solution to deactivate the remaining active
sites on the SAM. The gold slides were rinsed with 10 mM PBS solution
and then used for electrochemical measurement.

Electrochemical Measurement
Cyclic voltammetry on immobilized
CRY1 was carried out using a Bio-Logic VMP3 electrochemical workstation
with a three-electrode testing system. A platinum wire counter electrode
(Fisher Scientific), an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode
(Fisher Scientific), and a gold slide that functioned as the working
electrode made up the system. Note that the gold slide was in full
contact with the electrolyte and was electrically connected through
a piece of a copper tape. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed
in 10 mM PBS at room temperature under a nitrogen environment at the
scan rate of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 V s–1.
The photoinduced measurement was carried out using a handheld blue
laser (447 nm, Big Lasers Co.) with a fully covered illumination area
for the gold slide electrode. The temperature of the electrolyte solution
was monitored without seeing noticeable changes during the laser illumination
and under the magnetic field. Note that experiments were performed
with or without an external light and/or magnetic field for a total
of four different combinations for each different tested system (SAM/gold
slide with/without CRY1 immobilization). Each electrochemical experiment
was conducted three times, and the average data are presented.

Magnetic
Field Setup
Because the magnetic field of
each individual coil is nonuniform, two narrow coils with a large
radius, r (12.5 cm), were built
parallel to one another on the same axis, and with a spacing equal
to the radius. The arrangement of the two parallel coils makes the
magnetic field uniform in a typical region based on the superimposition
of the two fields. An electrochemical cell is placed between the two
coils for electrochemical measurements (see Figure 1). Given the Helmholtz arrangement of the
pair of coils, the following equation is used to calculate the magnetic
field 8  where H is the magnetic flux
density, μ is the magnetic field constant, I is the coil current (in A), N is the number of
turns in each coil, and r is the coil radius. After
simplifying, using the equation of H = 0.7433 × I in mT (the unit of I is A), we find the
magnetic fields to be 0.22, 0.44, 0.66, 0.88, 1.10, and 1.32 mT by
setting the power supply and adjusting the current for the Helmholtz
coils. The magnetic fields were also checked by a magnetic field gauss
meter (OMEGA).

Control Experiments
A few electrodes
were prepared
to ensure that the magnetic responsive signal measured in this study
is generated from the CRY1 proteins. The control 1 electrode is modified
with the mixed SAM of HS(CH2)10COOH and HS(CH2)8OH. The control 2 electrode is prepared using
the same procedure of protein immobilization, but the incubation solution
is the cell lysate solution from an empty vector (no CRY1 in the solution
as the negative control of the purchased CRY1). The control 3 electrode is prepared using
the same binding procedure but free FADs are immobilized instead of
CRY1. These control electrodes were measured in the cyclic voltammetry
upon the blue light illumination under the absence or presence of
the magnetic field. No magnetic responses were found from those control
electrodes (Figures S5,S6, S11–S14), which ensures that the electrochemical signal changes of CRY1-immobilized
electrodes under the magnetic field arise from the photoactivated
CRY1 proteins.
