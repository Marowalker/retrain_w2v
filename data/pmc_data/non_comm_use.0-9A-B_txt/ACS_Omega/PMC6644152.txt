This work presents a pioneering multidisciplinary
approach toward
enhancing biohybrid light-emitting diodes (BioHLEDs), merging synthetic
biology tools, polymer chemistry, and device engineering to design
a thin color down-converting coating with a single white-emitting
fluorescent protein (WFP). In particular, the WFP consists of fused
red-, green-, and blue-emitting FPs following the so-called protein
superglue approach. This WFP shows an efficient and stable white emission
originated from a Förster resonance energy transfer between
FP moieties. The emission chromaticity is, in addition, easily controlled
by the rigidity of the polymer matrix of the coating, reaching photoluminescence
quantum yields of 26% that stand out among intrinsic white-emitting
materials. The WFP single-component color down-converting packaging
was applied to fabricate BioHLEDs featuring efficient neutral white
emission that is stable over 400 h. This represents the most stable
BioHLED reported to date. Thus, this work is a landmark for the use
of synthetic biology tools to design tailored luminescent biomaterials
for lighting applications.

1 Introduction
Over
the last years, white biohybrid light-emitting diodes (BioHLEDs)
have emerged as a new approach toward sustainable and eco-friendly
white lighting sources following the “Green Photonics”
concept.1,2 Generally speaking, HLEDs use efficient
inorganic high-energy emitting chips and fully organic color down-converting
packagings to partially convert UV or blue irradiations into the low-energy
part of the visible spectrum. The combination of electroluminescence
and photoluminescence responses leads to white lighting sources featuring
high color quality with x/y CIE
coordinates of 0.30–3/0.30–3, color rendering index
(CRI) above 80, and correlated color temperatures (CCT) ranging from
2700 to 6500 K. However, these devices exhibit a stability of less
than 100 h caused by the photo- and thermal degradation of the color
down-converting materials,1−13 which poses a serious limitation for standard applications.

BioHLEDs are a new class of lighting devices that are divided into
two families depending on the type of color down-converting packagings.
On the one hand, several groups have demonstrated the use of biomaterials,
such as cellulose, starch, mucine, and so forth, as matrices to host
carbon dots, coordination complexes, laser dyes, and conjugated polymers.9−13 The interest in these biomatrices stems from the use of water, the
ease of film preparation, and the final mechanical and optical features—for
example, transmittance superior to 80%, refractive index between 1
and 1.5, tensile modulus in the GPa regimes along with elongations
between 1 and 20%, among others. On the other hand, the use of fluorescent
proteins (FPs) as emitters has recently been demonstrated in dry films4,5 and in an elastomeric polymer matrix.3,8 Although the
former achieved energy conversions over 90% and luminous efficiencies
over 100 lm/W regardless of the FP purity grade, the latter showed
record stabilities up to 100 h without degradation of color quality
(CRI = 80) and luminous efficiency (55 lm/W), as well as a high versatility
toward the fabrication of either single-point lighting sources3 or microstructured color filters for displays.8

Common to the use of FPs is the need of
packaging designs to ensure
high-quality white light via energy-transfer processes from the UV-
or blue-emitting chip to green-emitting FP and from this to the red-emitting
FP. In dry films, the major limitations are the control of both the
color quality and the luminescence spatial distribution, as FPs are
randomly distributed in the films, which implies nonefficient energy-transfer
processes related to the distance among FPs when the material is collapsed
and dry.6 In addition, the lack of FP stabilizers
limits the device stability. As far as the elastomeric packaging is
concerned, two approaches toward white BioHLEDs have been demonstrated,
namely millimeter-thick multilayered FP coatings with a bottom-up
energy-transfer cascade scheme and micropatterned single-layered FP
coatings—Figure 1.3,8 The white quality is controlled by the thickness
of each layer, the amount of FPs included, and the micropattern design
(i.e., line, open, or closed grid). Similar to the dry films approach,
the use of three FPs in the elastomeric coating leads to nonreproducible
emission features, as the Förster resonance energy-transfer
(FRET) process is affected by the random spatial distribution of the
FPs going from solution to the rubber stage under vacuum treatment.6 An example involving the three FPs is provided
in Figure S1. Besides these aspects, the
main drawback is the thickness of the packagings (up to millimeters)
that leads to poor light outcoupling, associated with both low transmittance
and changes in the refractive index caused by the number of interfaces.
In addition, the fabrication of both multilayered and micropatterned
coatings is tedious, as it involves several deposition/testing steps
until the desired white emission is achieved. Hence, it is instrumental
to develop thin-film coatings based on a single FP emitter, whose
photoluminescence leads to white BioHLEDs.

and WFP coatings. Center: Synthesis of WFP using the protein superglue

form (lane 4) exposed to UV light.

Herein, we took advantage of a new synthetic biology approach
based
on the protein superglue concept to engineer a novel fused WFP to
fabricate single-layered color down-converting packagings for single-component
white BioHLEDs. This manuscript discloses three significant advances.
First, the synthesis of the first WFP using two fully orthogonal protein
superglue systems, SpyCatcher–SpyTag and SnoopCatcher–SnoopTag,
for covalent and irreversible protein assembly.14−16 The Spy and
the Snoop systems are widely used post-translational protein ligation
tools based on spontaneous isopeptide bond formation between Catcher
and Tag under a wide range of conditions,14 but, to the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been applied
to FPs yet. In short, blue-, green-, and red-emitting FPs (mTagBFP,
eGFP, and mCherry, respectively) were genetically fused to Catcher
and Tag domains to ensure proper protein assembly when components
are mixed—Figure 1.15,16 Second, the optimization of the interaction
between the packaging matrix and the WFP leads to stable white emission
with photoluminescence quantum yields (ϕ) of 26% that is top
among other intrinsic white-emitting materials such as perovskites,17 conjugated polymers,18 hybrid nanoparticles, and so forth.19 Finally, first single-component BioHLEDs featuring a neutral white
color (CRI > 90) stable over hundreds of hours (>400 h) are
presented
as a proof of concept of this multidisciplinary approach.

2 Results and Discussion
The preparation of WFPs involved
the recombinant expression of
the three single FP components of the trimer, mTagBFP-SpyCatcher,
SpyTag-eGFP-SnoopTag, and mCherry-SnoopCatcher, in Escherichia coli (E. coli M15 [pREP4]) cells—Figures 1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. Subsequent affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose resin under
native conditions was applied to purify the FP of interest—Figure S3. Having fused cognate Catcher and Tag
interaction partners to blue-, green-, and red-emitting FPs, they
could be linked irreversibly just by mixing them in an equimolar ratio—that
is, in vitro reconstitution; Supporting Information. Covalent interaction kinetics was monitored for up to 24 h by SDS–PAGE
and Western blot analysis—Figure S4. Samples were boiled in a 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing
SDS detergent before gel loading to prove the covalent character of
respective Catcher–Tag interactions.14 The resulting WFP was then further purified in a second chromatography
step to remove monomeric and dimeric side products—Figures 1 and S5. Please notice that the genetic fusion construct
was hardly expressed in E. coli and
probably quite unstable as shown by the SDS analysis after purification.

Pure WFP was checked for fluorescent properties by performing a
native SDS–PAGE followed by UV light exposure—Figures 1 and S5. In more detail, the steady-state absorption
and photoluminescence features of the purified WFP in solution confirm
the success of protein binding in a trimeric form—Figure 2. The absorption
spectrum consists of four well-defined bands centered at 340, 400,
490, and 585 nm, resulting from the sum of the absorption features
of each FP moiety—that is, mTagBFP, eGFP, and mCherry. However,
photoluminescence is heavily dependent on the excitation wavelength
(λexc). In particular, excitation between 300–310
and 340–360 nm leads to a white emission with three peaks located
at 450, 510, and 610 nm and with a balanced emission intensity, whereas
excitation between 310–330 nm and 360–400 nm leads to
emission bands with the same peaks, but with dominant intensity for
the green and blue peaks, respectively. As mCherry features an absorption
band centered at 340 nm, the photoluminescence behavior suggests that
the FRET process from mTagBFP to eGFP is effective at λexc < 350 nm, but not from eGFP to mCherry. Indeed, exclusive
excitation of the eGFP moiety (λexc in the range
of 450–500 nm) does not lead to significant activation of the
mCherry emission via FRET—Figure 2. This might be related to both the nature
of the interaction systems used to fuse the single components (Spy
and Snoop) and the ease of conformational changes of the WFP in solution.
There are certain differences in the binding units used for the linkage
of eGFP–mCherry (Snoop-system) and the mTagBFP–eGFP
(Spy-system). Both systems mainly differ in their amino acid composition
and structure,14−16 which might affect the energy transfer. Another possibility
could be that the fusion of interaction domains to the FPs and the
linkage reaction alters the stability of mCherry, eGFP, and mTagBFP
moieties.

as well as excitation wavelength vs emission wavelength map (bottom)
of the WFP in aqueous solution.

As far as the structural flexibility of WFP in solution is
concerned,
it is well-known that the FRET process in oligomeric FPs can be enhanced
in solid matrices either increasing its concentration20−22 or locking the structure of oligomeric FPs.23,24 Following this rationale, we investigated the photoluminescence
features of novel WFP in an elastomeric polymer matrix, whose mechanical
and optical features are suitable for LED packaging, while it has
been proven that the FP emission is significantly stabilized under
storage conditions.1−3,8 In particular, the elastomeric
matrix consists of a mix of branched and linear poly(ethylene oxide)
(l-PEO) compounds—that is, trimethylolpropane ethoxylate (TMPE)
and l-PEO, respectively—in a WFP solution (0.1 mg/mL). This
is followed by (i) vigorous stirring for a few hours forming a hydrogel
and (ii) a drying process under gentle vacuum overnight forming the
rubberlike material—see Supporting Information.

As a first step, WFP was embedded in thin rubbers (50 μm)
with a TMPE/l-PEO mass ratio of 12:1 and the photoluminescence features
were studied at λexc = 400 nm, which corresponds
to the maximum absorption of mTagBFP. Similar to the emission of WFP
in solution (0.1 mg/mL), 12:1 rubbers show an emission band composed
of three peaks centered at 450, 510, and 610 nm. However, the intensity
of both the green- and red-emitting peaks is significantly enhanced,
while the intensity of the blue-emitting part is correspondingly reduced.
This is in line with the enhancement of the FRET process between FPs
in solid-state and/or rigid matrices.19−24 Recently, we have shown that the rheological features of the hydrogels
can be easily controlled by the molecular weight and the amount of
l-PEO used to prepare micropatterned coatings.8 In the same manner, it is also possible to fine-tune the rigidity
of the matrix network in the final rubber by increasing the amount
of l-PEO. This is nicely confirmed by dynamic rheological assays,
in which the mechanical modulus increases. For example, if G′ at 1 rad/s is compared, the values obtained for
12:1, 8:1, 6:1, and 4:1 rubbers are 26.2, 35.7, 58.3, and 80.6 kPa,
respectively—Figure S6. Figure 3 displays the changes
of the emission spectra upon increasing the rigidity of the rubbers.
Here, the intensity balance between green and red emission peaks is
kept, while the blue emission peak steadily decreases. Among all the
polymer matrix compositions, 6:1 rubbers show the best white emission
in terms of color quality—that is, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.34/0.37, CRI = 93, and CCT
of 4900 K—Figure 3. In addition, the ϕ of the 6:1 rubber was 26%, representing
a record value in intrinsic white-emitting materials.17−19 Finally, the emission features are stable under storage (room temperature
and moisture) and stress (temperature increase from 30 to 90 °C
with a ramp of 1 °C/min) conditions—Figure S7.

the WFP embedded into different TMPE/l-PEO mass ratios of the network
matrix (λexc = 400 nm). Pictures of WFP (bottom)
in aqueous solution (left), hydrogel (middle), and 6:1 rubber (right).

Encouraged by these results, we
decided to fabricate BioHLEDs using
commercial UV-LEDs with a 400 nm emitting chip—that is, WINGER
WEPUV3-S2 UV Power LED Star (Blacklight) 1.2 W—covered by a
thin (100 μm) color down-converting coating based on 6:1 rubbers
with the novel WFP (5 mg)—Figure 1. The color conversion and stability of the
devices were characterized at different applied currents and constant
applied current, respectively. Changes in the emission spectrum, luminous
efficiency, and temperature of the BioHLEDs were monitored—see Supporting Information. Upon applying different
currents ranging from 20 to 200 mA, the color down-conversion efficiency
(ηcon), which is defined as the ratio between the
area of the LED emission covered with a coating with and without the
WFP, holds constant at around 75%—Figure S8, indicating that there is no saturation, bleaching, and/or
nonlinear quenching effects upon increasing the driving current. For
the stability studies, we first selected the applied current at which
the maximum efficiency of the commercial LED is achieved—that
is, 10 mA, from which this value exponentially decreases because of
the increase in the temperature of the emitting chip caused by the
reduction of the internal quantum efficiency—Figure S9. As such, we decided to monitor the color quality
and device efficiency (15 lm/W) at this applied current over time—Figure 4. Remarkably, the
single-component white BioHLEDs featured a broad emission spectrum
consisting of four peaks centered at 400 nm (LED emission) and 450,
520, and 610 nm (color down-conversion coating). This light spectrum
corresponds to a neutral white emission with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.37/0.38, CRI = 91, and CCT
of 4300 K.25 Moreover, the BioHLEDs showed
minimal changes in the emission spectrum at different measured angles—Figure S10, suggesting a uniform spherical light
distribution. For comparison purposes, this emission spectrum is similar
to that of the direct sunlight measured in June 2018 at noon in Madrid
(Spain). Finally, both the color quality and luminous efficiency hold
constant over 200 h under continuous operation—Figure 4. From this point on, the red-emitting
part of the spectrum starts to attenuate, changing the emission color
toward a cold white emission and decreasing the luminous efficiency
to 10 lm/W. These features hold constant for another 200 h (<5%
change)—Figure 4, representing one of the most stable BioHLEDs reported so far.1−5,8 The loss of the red-emitting part
is ascribed to the degradation of the mCherry protein.26 This is in line with previous studies, which
showed that its nonradiative deactivation via a dark excited state
is faster than those of the high-energy emitting analogous. In addition,
this deactivation process enhances the mCherry absorption intensity
at the high-energy part of the spectrum, further reducing the emission
from the other FPs, affecting the overall efficiency of the BioHLED.8

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, this work presents the preparation of a novel white-emitting
fused FP applying the protein superglue approach to mTagBFP, eGFP,
and mCherry moieties and its implementation in solid-state lighting.
This novel WFP shows an excellent stability in an elastomeric matrix
used for color down-converting purposes in HLEDs, such as BioHLEDs.
It is worth noting that the emission spectra of WFP is easily tuned
by changing the rigidity of the polymer network, leading to a neutral
white emission associated with a record ϕ of 26% that is, in
addition, stable for device applications. This allows us to prepare
thin, single-component white packagings that circumvent the efficiency
limits and fabrication concerns of current FP-based color down-converting
packagings used in BioHLEDs (i.e., thick multilayered or thin microstructured
configurations). As a proof of concept, BioHLEDs prepared using this
novel WFP packaging featured efficiencies ranging from 10 to 15 lm/W
in concert with a neutral white emission stable over 400 h. Subsequent
changes in the device performance (efficiency and color) are associated
with the degradation of the red-emitting protein (mCherry), pointing
out the need to enhance photostability of red-emitting FPs, which
could be done by simply exchanging mCherry with another red FP that
shows more suitable properties. Possible candidates for the exchange
could be the FPs mRuby27 and mScarlet.28 Work along these lines is currently underway
in our laboratories. This work represents a landmark for the use of
synthetic biology tools to design tailored luminescent biomaterials
for lighting applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Cloning of Gene Constructs
To combine
the genes encoding for the different superglue protein domains (SpyCatcher,
SpyTag, SnoopCatcher, and SnoopTag) and the FPs (eGFP, mTagBFP, and
mCherry), the overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method
was performed using gene-specific oligonucleotides (Tables S1 and S2). mTagBFP5 was genetically fused to SpyCatcher,
the eGFP6-DNA construct was constructed to be surrounded by SpyTag-peptide
N-terminally and SnoopTag at the C-terminus. The red FP mCherry7 was
fused to the SnoopCatcher domain. FPs and Catcher-/Tag-domains were
separated by a linear, flexible glycine-serine linker (GSGSGSG) increasing
the probability for proper post-translational protein folding (sequences
of final gene constructs are attached). The cloning scheme and primers
used are listed in Tables S1 and S2. High-Fidelity
Phusion DNA-polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to perform
all PCR amplifications. After overlap-PCR and gel extraction following
the manufacturer’s instruction (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit,
Qiagen), the desired DNA products were ligated into the pQE-9 E. coli expression vector (Qiagen) containing an
N-terminal 6xHis affinity tag, using compatible sticky ends (restriction
enzymes from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Subsequent transformation into XL1Blue chemically competent E. coli cells and plasmid isolation were performed.
The sequences of all pQE-9 expression constructs were verified using
Sanger Sequencing (GATC Biotech). Recombinant protein expression and
purification: the pQE-9 expression constructs containing the gene
of interest N-terminally fused to the His6 tag encoded in the pQE-9
vector, were transformed into chemically competent M15 [pREP4] E. coli cells (Qiagen), and plated on LB agar plates
with 200 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL kanamycin. Single
colonies were grown overnight at 28 °C in liquid LB medium (10
g NaCl, 10 g Trypton, 5 g yeast extract per 1 L) containing 25 μg/mL
kanamycin and 200 μg/mL ampicillin. The overnight cultures were
used to inoculate 1 L expression cultures (LB medium with the appropriate
antibiotics: 25 μg/mL kanamycin and 200 μg/mL ampicillin)
to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm. The expression cultures were
grown with shaking at 180–200 rpm at 28 °C until an optical
density OD600 of 0.5 was reached. By adding 1 mM IPTG (Roth)
(final concentration), recombinant protein expression was induced
for 4 h at 28 °C with shaking at 180–200 rpm prior to
harvest by centrifugation (5000g, 20 min, 4 °C).
Cell pellets were frozen and stored at −20 °C until further
processing.

For protein purification via affinity chromatography,
harvested cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis
buffer containing Pefabloc protease inhibitor (Roth) (1 mM final concentration)
and lysozyme (1 mg/mL final concentration) to minimize protein degradation
and increase lysis efficiency.

Cell lysis was further performed
by sonication on ice (six 10 s
bursts with cooling pause between each burst). The lysate was then
centrifuged at 10 000g for 30 min at 4 °C
to separate the soluble (supernatant) from the insoluble (pellet)
proteins. Recombinant proteins from the supernatant, containing an
N-terminal His6 tag, were purified using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid
(Ni-NTA; Qiagen) affinity chromatography under native (nondenaturing)
conditions following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen
Expressionist).8 The following buffers
were used: lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0;
300 mM NaCl; and 250 mM imidazole). Polypropylene columns (5 mL; Qiagen)
packed with Ni-NTA Agarose resin (Qiagen) were used for purification.
Purified proteins were dialyzed in 1× PBS buffer (136 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The concentration of the recombinant
proteins was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm using
a Nano-Drop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Peqlab) and taking into account
the specific molar extinction coefficients of the proteins. If needed,
proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units
with 10 kDa MWCO (Merck, Millipore). In vitro interaction of single-protein
components by split isopeptide reconstitution: purified fluorescent
fusion proteins were mixed in an equimolar ratio (90 μM input
each, resulting in a 30 μM final concentration each) and incubated
for 24 h at 4 °C while shaking at 500 rpm. Spontaneous isopeptide
bond formation was monitored by taking samples every hour and performing
interaction kinetics (Figure S4). 4×
Laemmli buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 18% β-mercaptoethanol,
40% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 8% SDS) was added to the
samples prior to boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated
on SDS–PAGE (12% Bis-Tris gel) and either directly stained
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(Anti-His peroxidase linked Western blot analysis) to visualize the
formation and content of covalent products (dimers and trimers) resulting
from the interaction between tag and catcher constructs over time.

SEC of the trimer: 24 h after starting the covalent reaction, the
interaction mixture was subjected to SEC to separate monomers and
dimers and to isolate the desired trimer. Prior to loading the proteins
on the column, the solution was concentrated up to 10 mg protein/mL
using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (100 kDa). A Superdex
200 Prep Grade 16/60 column was used with 50 mM PO42–, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 as running buffer. The SEC fractions
were monitored on SDS–PAGE, fractions containing the pure trimer
were pooled and concentrated to desired concentrations for further
LED application.

4.2 Preparation of WFP-Based
Rubbers
As a first step, the buffer solution with WFP was
added to a mixture
of branched and l-PEO compounds—that is, TMPE with Mn of 450
mol wt and l-PEO with Mn of 5 × 106 mol wt, respectively.
Both materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
The initial hydrogel is prepared by adding TMPE (100 mg) to the WFP
aqueous solution under stirring conditions (500 rpm overnight). At
this point, different amounts of l-PEO were added and further stirred
for 24 h. Finally, the gels were placed into a mold and dried under
gentled vacuum (1 mbar) over night.

4.3 Spectroscopic
and Mechanical Characterizations
The steady-state absorption
and emission measurements were performed
in both solution and thin film coated on a quartz substrate using
UV-2600 Spectrometer (Shimadzu) and FS5 Spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh)
coupled with integrating sphere for ϕ measurements. Thermal
stability was obtained using a heating station coupled to (i) an IR
camera (FLIR FS5), (ii) an excitation source of LED array (4 ×
390 EDs), and (iii) a detection station consisting of spectrophotometer
(Avaspec-ULS2048L-USB2). The thickness was measured using an Alpha-Step
D500 Profilometer (Tencor) and further analyzed by using Gaussian
functions as implemented in the software. The rheological behavior
of the rubbers was measured under oscillatory mode using a parallel
plate rheometer (AR200EX, TA Instruments) with disposable aluminum
plates. Samples of 25 mm in diameter and around 0.8 mm of thickness
were placed between the plates of the rheometer and subjected to an
oscillatory shear strain of constant amplitude of 5% and a fixed normal
force of 10 N, during a frequency sweep at 30 °C.

4.4 Fabrication and Characterization of BioHLEDs
UV-LED
WINGER WEPUV3-S2 UV Power LED Star (Blacklight) 1.2 W was
purchased and modified with the WFP–coating. The preparation
of BioHLEDs concerns a two-step procedure. First, the encapsulation
system of the LED was coated with the WFP hydrogel. Second, LED is
placed in the vacuum station for drying under 1 mbar overnight. The
amount of WFP was optimized to realize a white emission upon increasing
the applied current as mentioned in the text. The BioWHLEDs were characterized
using Keithley 2400 as a current source, while the luminous efficiency
and changes of the electroluminescence spectrum were monitored using
an Avantes spectrophotometer (Avaspec-ULS2048L-USB2) in conjunction
with an integrating sphere (Avasphere 30-Irrad). At the applied driving
conditions, the top temperature of LED did not significantly change
from room-temperature values over time.
