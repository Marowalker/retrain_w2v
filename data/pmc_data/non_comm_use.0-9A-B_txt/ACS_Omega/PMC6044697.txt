Epoxygoniolide-1
(1), possessing spiroepoxide lactone,
enal, and masked dialdehyde functionalities, has been characterized
from the conspicuously patterned mollusc Goniobranchus
splendidus. Its relative configuration was investigated
by spectroscopic analyses, molecular modeling, and density functional
theory calculations. The biosynthesis of 1 may involve
rearrangement of a diterpene framework, providing a precursor to cometabolite
gonioline (2), followed by C–C bond cleavage (via
Grob or P450 mechanism). Moderate cytotoxicity to NCIH-460, SW60,
or HepG2 cancer cells was observed for norditerpene 1.

1 Introduction
Many
animals use bright, colorful visual signals to warn potential
predators that they store toxic or distasteful compounds as chemical
defenses. In the marine environment, nudibranchs are shell-less molluscs
that exhibit a range of conspicuous color signals, and many species
contain terpene metabolites possessing anti-infective,1 anti-inflammatory,2 neuroprotective,3 and cytotoxic effects.1,4,5 Our quest to explore the chemistry underpinning
the relationship between conspicuousness with toxicity has led us
to uncover new terpene scaffolds from nudibranchs.6 Herein, we report the isolation and stereochemical characterization
of two new norditerpenes, epoxygoniolide-1 (1) and gonioline
(2), from the chromodorid mollusc Goniobranchus
splendidus. The carbon framework of epoxygoniolide-1
is richly decorated with structural motifs that are potential candidates
for attack by amine, thiol, or hydroxy nucleophiles. Studies extend
to a plausible biosynthesis involving a Grob-type fragmentation, as
well as an assessment of the cytotoxic properties and stability of 1 against human cancer cells.

2 Results
and Discussion
A single specimen of G. splendidus, collected by scuba diving from the Great Barrier Reef near Mackay,
North Queensland, was dissected into mantle rim, mantle, and gut tissue,
with each tissue type extracted with acetone, partitioned into Et2O solubles, and analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) (CDCl3). The rim (9.8 mg) and combined
mantle/viscera (7.7 mg) extracts were separately fractioned by normal-phase
(NP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to yield two new
metabolites 1 and 2 (Figure 1), along with 16 known metabolites. Structure
elucidation of the new metabolites was supported by detailed spectroscopic
and computational analyses.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of norditerpenes 1–3 (with atom numbering based on that in the
spongionellin
(3) skeleton7).

The major component of the extract, epoxygoniolide-1
(1), was isolated as a white amorphous solid and displayed
a sodium
adduct ion at m/z 415.1730 [M +
Na]+, which corresponded to a molecular formula of C21H28O7, implying 8° of unsaturation.
The 13C NMR data (Table 1) revealed 21 signals, including those for an acetate
group, suggestive of a norditerpene skeleton. There were two alkene
signals at δC 134.9 and 172.1, an α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde carbon at δC 195.9, and signals that could
be attributed to a spiroepoxide (δC 48.8 (CH2) and 58.0 (C)).8 The 1H NMR spectrum revealed three methyl singlets at δH 0.84, 0.94, and 1.16; an acetate methyl at δH 2.03;
an alkene at δH 6.96; an aldehyde at δH 9.35 (d); and two acetal protons at δH 6.45
(d) and 6.65 (d). Two doublets at δH 2.92 and 3.15
(J = 5.2 Hz) further supported the epoxide functionality.8

Inspection of
the gradient correlation spectroscopy (gCOSY), heteronuclear
single-quantum coherence (HSQC), and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation
(HMBC) data established a planar structure for 1 (Figure 2). The trimethylcyclohexane
fragment, common to rearranged diterpenes,6,7,9 was linked to the alkene through HMBC correlations
from H-9 at δH 6.96 to δC 39.5 (C-1),
52.8 (C-5), and 30.7 (Me-19). H-7 (δH 9.35) of the
α,β-unsaturated aldehyde gave HMBC correlations to δC 43.1 (C-14) and 172.1 (C-9). The 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane
ring system was apparent from gCOSY connectivities that linked H-14
(δH 3.83) to both H-13 (δH 3.22)
and H-15 (δH 6.65), as well as H-13 to H-16 (δH 6.45). There were HMBC correlations from δH 6.65 (H-15) to δC 45.1 (C-13) and the acetate carbonyl
at δC 168.8, as well as correlations from δH 6.45 (H-16) to δC 99.3 (C-15), 43.1 (C-14),
58.0 (C-12), and the lactone at δC 170.8 (C-11).
HMBC correlations from H-14 and H-15 to the quaternary alkene at δC 134.9 (C-8) and from the epoxide protons H2-6
(δH 3.15 and 2.92) to the carbonyl C-11 (δC 170.8) completed a planar carbon skeleton unprecedented in
the natural products literature. A rotating-frame Overhauser spectroscopy
(ROESY) correlation between H-7/H-9 defined an E-configured
alkene (Figure 3).
The remaining stereochemistry is considered in detail below.

Gonioline 2 was isolated by NP-HPLC
(30% EtOAc/hexanes)
as a colorless oil. The molecular formula of C23H32O8 was established by (+)-high-resolution electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) (m/z 459.1993 [M + Na]+, calcd 459.1987), implying
8° of unsaturation. Analysis of the 13C NMR (CDCl3) data for 2 (Table 1) provided 23 signals, including resonances
attributed to two acetates (δC 170.3, 20.9; and 169.3,
20.8), an ester/lactone (δC 173.0), and a trisubstituted
olefin (δC 137.7 and 130.5), implying a tetracyclic
norditerpene. Diagnostic 2D NMR (CDCl3) gCOSY, HSQC, and
HMBC correlations established the carbon skeleton for 2 (Figure 2). The trimethylcyclohexane
ring was linked to an alkene by HMBC correlations from δH 6.13 (H-9) to δC 42.2 (C-1), 51.9 (C-5),
and 32.3 (Me-19) and from δH 1.19 (H-5b) to δC 137.7 (C-9). The presence of a cyclohexyl-fused tetrahydrofuranfuranone
moiety was established by gCOSY connections that linked H-14 (δH 3.95) to H-13 (δH 3.33) and H-15 (δH 6.15) as well as H-13 to H-16 (δH 6.31)
and by an HMBC correlation from H-13 to C-6 (δC 40.4).
There were also gCOSY correlations from H2-6 (δH 2.53 and 2.10) to the H-7 oxymethine (δH 4.18), and HMBC correlations from H2-6 to the C-11 carbonyl
(δC 173.0). HMBC correlations from δH 6.13 (H-9) to δC 65.3 (C-7) and δC 43.3 (C-14), from H-14 to C-9, and from (H2-6) to the
quaternary alkene carbon at δC 130.5 then completed
the planar structure of gonioline. The tricyclic ring system of 2 is similar to that of chromodorolide B10 or darwinolide,11 except for
the replacement of the cyclopentyl or cycloheptenyl ring by a cyclohexyl
ring. An E-configured alkene was assigned from a
NOESY correlation between H-7 and H-9.

NOESY correlations between
H-14 and H-16; H-13 and H-16; and H-13
and H-14 revealed the same configuration of the tetrahydrofuran ring
in 1 and 2 (Figure 3). The JH-14/H-15 values were 6.6 and 5.4 Hz, respectively, which are comparable to
the J values of macfarlandin C (see Tables S1 and S2). In rearranged terpenes such as norrisolide,12 macfarlandin C,13 and chromodorolide B,10 for which identical
relative configurations of the 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane ring
system have been secured by X-ray crystallographic analysis, the published 1H NMR data show that a small change in conformation can have
a significant effect on the magnitude of JH-14/H-15 associated with the tetrahydrofuran ring.13 The cyclohexyl-fused ring of 2 adopts a flattened chair
conformation owing to the alkene linkage (Figure 3), with the axially configured H-7 evidenced
by vicinal couplings to H-6a (J = 4.4 Hz) and H-6b
(J = 9.4 Hz). The NOESY correlation observed between
H-7 and H-15 defined the relative configuration at C-7, whereas H-13
and 12-OAc were positioned in the less-strained cis configuration rather than in the alternative trans configuration.

To resolve the remaining stereochemical features
of 1, we exploited the possibility that the gonioline
skeleton may constitute
a biosynthetic link between the spongian ring system commonly encountered
in nudibranch and sponge diterpenes5 and
the unique spiroepoxide framework of 1 (Scheme 1). First, the spongian precursor
(4) is converted to the carbon skeleton (5), associated with the spongionellin series of metabolites, by C-17
methyl migration, oxidative cleavage of C-5–C-6 involving the
loss of C-6, and cleavage of the C-9–C-11 bond. In this way,
the C-8 methyl group of the spongian precursor provides the C-6 carbon
of the spongionellin framework.7 Epoxidation
of the C-6–C-7 bond is followed by cyclohexyl ring formation,
yielding allylic alcohol intermediate 6. The cyclization
yielding 6 is formally classified as a disfavored 6-endo-tet reaction by Baldwin’s rules,
but the fact that the cleaved C–O bond lies outside the newly
formed ring is consistent with 6-exo cyclization.14 Enzymatic control has been proposed as an explanation
for anti-Baldwin ring closure of epoxides in biosynthesis.15 Oxidation at C-12 followed by acetylation provides
intermediate 7; subsequent lactone formation then gives
gonioline (2). The C-6–C-7 bond and the 12-OAc
group of 2 are optimally oriented from a stereoelectronic
perspective for bond cleavage via a Grob-type mechanism (Figure 4a),16,17 thereby generating the exo-methylene-functionalized
intermediate 8 from either 2 or, more simply,
its immediate precursor, 6. Subsequent epoxidation and
lactone formation then leads directly to the carbon skeleton of 1. Alternatively, the key C–C bond cleavage forming 8 might involve a P450-catalyzed transformation, with a mechanism
similar to that involved in homoterpene, psoralen, or secologanin
biosynthesis,18 in which case, prior functionalization
at C-12 is not required.

Scheme 1 Putative Biosynthetic Relationships
of 1 and 2 and Their Link to a Spongian
Terpene Framework (X = OH or OR)
From a stereochemical perspective, and arbitrarily selecting
the
10S configuration frequently associated with marine
diterpenes,19 this biosynthetic scenario
predicts a 13S,14R,15R,16S configuration for the 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane
ring. To probe the spiroepoxide (C-12) configuration of 1, the truncated structure (9), in which a methyl group
replaced the conformationally flexible trimethylcyclohexane ring,
was selected for computational analysis (Figure 4b). A Monte Carlo conformational search of
the 12R and 12S stereoisomers of 9 was undertaken with the Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations
(OPLS)-2005 force field, and next, selected conformers (<3 kcal/mol
of the global minimum) were optimized by (density functional theory)
DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the gas phase using
Gaussian software. The structures were further refined using B3LYP/631-G+(d,p)
with chloroform as solvent (IEF-PCM), and the isotropic shielding
constants computed from these energies were then examined using the
DP4+ approach;20 considering both 1H and 13C data, there was 99.89% probability that
C-12 of 9, and, by implication, that of 1 was R-configured. To further verify this stereochemical
conclusion, molecular modeling and DFT calculations were conducted
on two candidate stereoisomers of 1 (1a and 1b) that differed in configuration at C-12 and on two diastereomers
with the biosynthetically unlikely 10R absolute configuration
(1c and 1d) (Figure 4c). The energies associated with DFT-refined
structures were used to calculate the Boltzmann-averaged 1H NMR and 13C NMR chemical shifts of the four stereoisomers
(see Supporting Information); the calculated
mean absolute error values21 did not discriminate
between the four diastereomers, but when the isotropic shielding constants
computed from these energies were examined using DP4+ with both 1H and 13C NMR data, there was 90.39% probability
that the 10S*,12R* configuration
was the correct stereoisomer of 1. ROESY data for 1 further supported the proposed stereochemistry, with correlations
from the epoxide proton H-6b to Me-19 as well as from H-5a to H-14,
fully consistent with the proposed relative configuration (see Figure 3). In each of the
three lowest energy conformers of stereoisomer 1a (together
representing >96.5% of the conformational population and with only
minor differences in the conformation of the trimethylcyclohexane
ring), one of the epoxide protons was within 3.29 Å of the centroid
of Me-19. In the alternative stereoisomers, 1b–d, one or more of the internuclear distances corresponding
to these ROESY correlations were >5 Å.

Previous studies
have explored the cytotoxicity of oxygenated diterpenes
and norditerpenes, with varying levels of activity reported.1,4,5 Terpene 1 is embellished
with three potentially bioactive structural motifs: a diacetal acetate
moiety that masks the potential dialdehyde reactivity,22 an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde susceptible
to Michael addition,23 and a spiroepoxide24 accessible to nucleophilic attack in the presence
of free amino or thiol groups. Indeed, a spiroepoxide moiety positioned
α to a carbonyl group is the “warhead” central
to the catalytic mechanism of a family of proteasome inhibitors (e.g.,
epoxomicin and its synthetic analogue carfilzomib).25 However, when epoxygoniolide-1 (1) was screened
against human lung (NCIH-460), colorectal (SW620), and liver (HepG2)
cancer cells, using vinblastine as a positive control, the metabolite
showed modest IC50 values of 10.2, 10.18, and 15.72 μM,
respectively. In view of this finding, we assessed the stability of 1 under a range of conditions. An NMR study in MeOH-d4 revealed that 1 was stable in
this solvent over a 24 h period. Norditerpene 1 was also
stable in dimethyl sulfoxide solution at 40 °C, either alone
or in the presence of alanine methyl ester hydrochloride as a potential
scavenger of a dialdehyde product. In the presence of the above-mentioned
cancer cell lines, the epoxide concentration declined over 6–12
h in a manner that paralleled toxicity. A mass spectrometric search
for acetyl-cleavage products, Michael adducts, or epoxide-hydrolyzed
products in the culture medium did not detect any definable products
and so it was not possible to discern which molecular feature of 1 might be responsible for the observed bioactivity.

There was insufficient quantity of gonioline (2) for
cytotoxicity screening. A parallel screening of four oxygenated norditerpenes
isolated from nudibranchs6 gave IC50 values in the range of 2.1–24.5 μM against
human lung (NCIH-460), colorectal (SW620), and liver (HepG2) cancer
cells (see Supporting Information). Taken
together with the data for 1, a pattern of moderate cytotoxicity
emerged for this suite of norditerpenes, from which we infer that
these metabolites may instead be utilized by the mollusc as an antipredator
defense. Assays with crustaceans and fish have indicated nudibranch
extracts containing spongian diterpenes, norditerpenes, or rearranged
diterpenes have antipalatability activity that prevails over their
toxicity.22,26

3 Conclusions
We isolated
two new oxygenated terpenes from the nudibranch G.
splendidus, each with an extensively rearranged
skeleton. We provided the first example of epoxide substitution onto
the 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane ring system, contributing significant
structural variation to this distinctive scaffold. Owing to the complex
arrangement of stereochemical elements, we resorted to in-silico analysis
using DFT calculations and DP4+ modeling to identify a statistically
reasonable diastereomer of 1. The spiroepoxide lactone
motif of 1 is compatible with a biosynthetic origin involving
cleavage of the C-6–C-7 bond of a precursor to 2 via either a Grob-type fragmentation or a P450-induced cleavage.
Moderate cytotoxicity was associated with the spiroepoxide. The presence
of 1 and 2 in the gut of G. splendidus provides circumstantial evidence of
a dietary (i.e., sponge) origin.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 General Experimental Procedures
Optical
rotations were obtained using a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter at 589 nm
using a 1 mL quartz cell (10 cm path length) for solutions in CHCl3. NMR spectra were recorded at ambient probe temperature on
a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer using a 5 mm selective inverse probe
or a Bruker Avance DRX 700 spectrometer with a 5 mm triple resonance
Zgrad probe. All of the NMR spectra were acquired in base-filtered
CDCl3 and referenced to solvent signals at δH 7.26 and δC 77.16 (CDCl3). Low-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker
Esquire HCT three-dimensional ion trap spectrometer in the positive
mode. HRESIMS was performed on a MicroTof-Q instrument with a standard
ESI source (sodium formate). HPLC was carried out using a 10 μm
silica (7.8 × 300) column with refractive index detection. Separations
were performed using isocratic solvent conditions up to 30% EtOAc
in hexanes at 2 mL/min using premixed, filtered, and degassed solvents.

4.2 Biological Material
The nudibranch
specimen was collected from the Mackay region of the Great Barrier
Reef, North Queensland, by scuba diving at depths between 2 and 15
m. The sample was stored at −20 °C until extraction. Photographs
of the specimen (G. splendidus #1102)
were kept at the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University
of Queensland.

4.3 Extraction and Purification
Prior
to extraction, the specimen was dissected into viscera, mantle, and
mantle border body segments. Individually, each body segment was finely
chopped, extracted with acetone (3 × 2 mL), and sonicated (5
min). Each extract was filtered through cotton wool and concentrated
to an aqueous suspension before partitioning between H2O (1 mL) and Et2O (3 × 1 mL). The upper organic layer
was retained, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered
through cotton wool, and evaporated under N2 to yield a
yellow oil for the mantle (2.9 mg), mantle rim (9.8 mg), and gut (4.8
mg). The crude extracts were screened by 1H NMR, and all
showed similar chemistry. The crude extract of the mantle rim was
filtered and the compounds were separated using NP-HPLC (30% EtOAc
in hexanes) to yield dendrillolide A27 (0.2
mg), aplysulphurin28 (0.2 mg), macfarlandin
E13 (0.2 mg), macfarlandin C13 (0.2 mg), spongionellin7 (3) (0.1 mg), macfarlandin D13 (0.4 mg), chromodorolide A29 (0.1 mg),

mg), aplyroseol-331 (0.2 mg), splendidalactone-16a (0.1 mg), epoxygoniolide-1 (1)
(1.0 mg), and gonioline 2 (0.1 mg). The crude extracts
of the mantle and gut were combined and filtered, and the compounds
were separated using NP-HPLC (25% EtOAc in hexanes) to isolate spongian-16-one32,33 (0.2 mg), 9,11-dihydrogracilin A34 (0.1
