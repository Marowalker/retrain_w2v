Tetrasubstituted
propargylamines comprise a unique class of highly
useful compounds, which can be accessed through the multicomponent
coupling between ketones, amines, and alkynes (KA2 coupling),
an underexplored transformation. Herein, the development of a novel,
highly efficient, and user-friendly catalytic system for the KA2 coupling, based on the environmentally benign, inexpensive,
and readily available zinc acetate, is described. This system is employed
in the multicomponent assembly of unprecedented, tetrasubstituted
propargylamines derived from structurally diverse, challenging, and
even biorelevant substrates. Notable features of this protocol include
the demonstration of the enhancing effect that neat conditions can
have on catalytic activity, as well as the expedient functionalization
of hindered, prochiral cyclohexanones, linear ketones, and interesting
molecular scaffolds such as norcamphor and nornicotine.

Introduction
Propargylamines are
a diverse family of organic compounds possessing
unique properties, which has been the subject of wide research with
continually increasing intensity.1,2 The soaring
scientific interest surrounding these compounds is partly because
of the bioactive nature exhibited by certain members of their family,
rendering them intrinsically valuable because of their potential use
in drug development, pharmacology, and medicine.1−3 Additionally,
propargylic amines are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis,
providing facile access to a multitude of structurally complex organic
scaffolds.1,2 Because of their highly functionalized character,
they can be easily transformed in various manners and rapidly lead
to the generation of molecular complexity, hence their utilization
in diversity-oriented synthesis and natural product synthesis.1,2,4−6 Moreover, they
serve as precursors to a wide variety of heterocyclic molecules,1 including oxazolidinones,7a,7b through the incorporation of carbon dioxide in a similar manner
to propargylic alcohols.7c Their value
as organic synthons is complemented by the fact that they can frequently
be accessed through catalytic, multicomponent reaction systems based
on the C–H activation of terminal alkynes,1,2,8 thus, obviating the generation of waste,
stemming from the synthesis and purification of imine and alkyne-derived
intermediates.9 Importantly, these systems
often involve the use of sustainable metal-based catalysts,10 which, in combination with the atom and step
economy associated with multicomponent synthesis and C–H activation,11 is an aspect giving them increased potential
from the standpoint of green methodology development.9 The most widely known reaction of this type is the A3 coupling (aldehyde, amine, alkyne).2,12,13 This three-component coupling reaction has
been thoroughly studied during the past two decades, leading to the
development of very efficient and sustainable catalytic protocols
for the synthesis of trisubstituted propargylamines.12−15 Notably, enantioselective versions of this metal-catalyzed reaction
were elegantly designed, not long after its formal discovery, with
the employment of appropriate chiral ligands.16

Ketimines exhibit substantially lower reactivity than aldimines
because of both their stereochemical and electronic characteristics.17 Therefore, addition of nucleophiles to ketimines
is usually challenging, with the exception of cyclohexanone-derived
ketimines, which react favorably because of the release of torsional
strain.18 As a result, the incorporation
of ketones instead of aldehydes in the A3 coupling represented
a nontrivial challenge until quite recently. Gaining access to ketone-derived,
tetrasubstituted (or α-tertiary) propargylamines through a catalytic,
multicomponent coupling is a worthy goal, considering the wide array
of natural products that possess α-tertiary amine moieties,19 the intrinsic value of propargylamines and the
inherently limited scope of other strategies used to access such molecules.20 The difficulty of this task was demonstrated
by Ramón and co-workers in 2010, when a maximum of 38% yield
was achieved after 7 days of reaction between piperidine, 3-pentanone
and phenylacetylene, catalyzed by the otherwise efficient Cu(OH)x–Fe3O4 catalyst.21 The first breakthrough was made by Van der Eycken
and co-workers, who exploited the enhanced reactivity of cyclohexanones
to construct propargylamines derived from cyclohexanones, benzylamines,
and phenylacetylene under homogeneous, solvent-less CuI catalysis,
and microwave irradiation, also coining the term “KA2 coupling” (ketone, amine, alkyne—Scheme 1).22 Later on, the same research group-coupled azoles instead of alkynes,
with secondary amines and cyclic ketones, under copper catalysis and
microwave irradiation.23 Subsequently,
AuBr3 in 4.0 mol % loading was used as the catalyst to
couple mostly secondary amines, cyclohexanones, and phenylacetylene.24 In a frequently overlooked work, a homogeneous
N-heterocyclic carbene–Au(I)-based system was used to facilitate
the coupling of alkynes with N,N′-disubstituted hydrazines and aldehydes/ketones, followed
by intramolecular hydroamination.25 Prompted
by the observation that Cu(OTf)2 catalyzes the reaction
between benzylamine, cyclohexanone, and an aliphatic alkyne,26 Larsen and co-workers developed a green, efficient
system for the KA2 coupling, based on CuCl2.27,28 The already wide scope of this system was expanded to include prochiral
ketones when Ti(OEt)4 was used as an additive.29 Ma and co-workers found that CuBr in toluene,
along with molecular sieves, was a very efficient and scalable catalytic
system for the KA2 coupling of secondary amines, various
ketones, and terminal alkynes.30 The first
and only system to incorporate aromatic ketones in the KA2 coupling was reported by the same group and relied on the cooperative
action of CuBr2, Ti(OEt)4, and sodium ascorbate.31 Only by using a different approach, in combination
with Cu2O catalysis, ω-chloro ketones, primary amines,
and alkynes could be coupled to furnish 2-alkynyl heterocycles.32 As expected, the rapidly increasing interest
in this reaction has also given rise to various heterogeneous catalytic
systems focusing on catalyst recyclability, such as those based on
Cu2O nanoparticles on titania,33a nano Cu2O–ZnO,33b Cu2O/nano-CuFe2O4,33c CuO/Fe2O3 nanoparticles,33d Cu(II)-hydromagnesite,33e polystyrene-supported, N-phenylpiperazine-CuBr2,33f Ag-doped nanomagnetic γ-Fe2O3@DA core–shell hollow spheres,33g Cu(II)@furfural imine-decorated Halloysite,33h CuI on Amberlyst A-21,33i Fe2O3@SiO2-IL/Ag hollow
spheres,33j semi-heterogeneous, magnetically
recoverable graphene oxide-supported CuCl2,33k and polystyrene-supported N-heterocyclic carbene–Au(III).33l

Scheme 1 The KA2 Coupling Reaction
The well-established field
of homogeneous zinc catalysis includes
the unique chemistry of in situ-generated zinc acetylides,34,35 which has witnessed a rapid evolution since the seminal discoveries
of Carreira and co-workers.11,35 Catalytic zinc acetylide addition has proven to be an effective
strategy for the synthesis of various types of propargylic amines.6,11,36 Specifically, addition to preformed
aldimines in the presence of TMSCl is catalyzed by ZnCl2,37 while Zn(OTf)2 in toluene is an efficient catalyst
for the alkynylation of unactivated, preformed aldimines and ketimines.38 The addition of cyclopropylacetylene to cyclic,
trifluoromethylated N-acyl imines has been achieved
using stoichiometric amounts of Zn(OTf)2,39 while ZnMe2 has been employed to mediate an
enantioselective version of A3 coupling and also the enantioselective
alkynylation of preformed, activated ketimines.40,41 Recently, ZnEt2 in 5.0 mol % in the presence of an acid
co-catalyst was used to synthesize N-unprotected, tetrasubstituted
propargylamines from N-unprotected, trifluoromethyl-substituted ketimines.42 Another recent approach to accessing tetrasubstituted
propargylamines was described by Trost and co-workers, who reported
the use of a chiral, dinuclear Zn-based catalyst (Zn-ProPhenol) to
facilitate the asymmetric addition of α,β- and β,γ-butenolides
to polyfluorinated alkynyl ketimines.43 A number of catalytic systems based on zinc have also been reported
for the A3 coupling. Zn(OAc)2·2H2O in toluene was used to construct a remarkably large library of
trisubstituted propargylamines,44 while
the efficiency of Zn(OTf)2 under neat conditions was only
recently surpassed by the use of zinc prolinate in only 1.0 mol %
loading.45,46 Notably, zinc catalysis has enabled the
multicomponent assembly of chiral propargylamines derived from chiral
amines and also their conversion to chiral, disubstituted allenes.47,48 ZnS nanoparticles have been used for the synthesis of trisubstituted
propargylamines, while a heterogeneous catalytic system based on supported
Zn(OAc)2 has also been developed for the A3 coupling.49,50

To the best of our knowledge, homogeneous
zinc catalysis has not
yet been extended to the KA2 coupling. Attempts have been
made utilizing Zn(OTf)224 and
ZnI2;51 however, these early
efforts were not successful because of the choice of the reaction
conditions. Prompted by our continuous interest in the applications
of sustainable metal catalysis in green organic transformations,11,52 we became interested in studying the potential of homogeneous zinc
catalysis in the KA2 coupling. Our goal was to develop
a highly efficient system based on a simple, widely available, inexpensive,
and environmentally benign zinc source, ideally functional under neat
conditions and able to facilitate the coupling of challenging and
synthetically interesting substrates. Being aware of the central role
of zinc in the synthesis of allenes,53 the possible implications of our findings
regarding the synthesis of ketone-derived, trisubstituted allenes
are also briefly addressed.

Results and Discussion
In order
to obtain proof of concept and identify an optimal, zinc-based
catalytic system, cyclohexanone (1a), piperidine (2a), and phenylacetylene (3a) were chosen as
model substrates (Table 1). A slight excess of cyclohexanone was used throughout this study,
in order to avoid the substrate loss due to self-condensation;54,55 however, this proved not to be an issue later on (vide infra). When
ZnCl2 was employed in 20 mol % loading and the reaction
was carried out under neat conditions at 98 °C for 20 h, propargylamine 4a was obtained in 38% isolated yield after column chromatography
(entry 1, Table 1).
Even though this was a promising result, a considerable number of
byproducts were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis of the reaction mixture. More specifically, enamines, deriving
from hydroamination of the alkyne, were frequently observed during
our studies (detected by GC/MS analysis and also identified by their
characteristic peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of column chromatography
fractions).20 It is important to note that
propargylamines originating from the alkynylation of ketiminium intermediates
deriving from these enamines were never observed.20d Repeating the reaction in toluene (1 M) at 120 °C,
simultaneously increased product yield and significantly reduced the
amounts of side products (entry 2, Table 1). An attempt was made to perform the reaction
under ultrasonic irradiation, a successful strategy in the A3 coupling,55 nevertheless leading to a
negative result in this case (entry 3, Table 1). An insignificant increase in yield was
observed when the reaction was carried out under neat conditions at
120 °C for a prolonged time (entry 4, Table 1), suggesting that different Lewis acids
had to be considered. When Zn(OAc)2 was used in toluene,
propargylamine 4a was obtained in 75% isolated yield,
while the formation of undesirable byproducts was also reduced (entry
5, Table 1). Using
ZnCO3 and ZnSO4 led to only traces of the desired
product, same as FeCl3, which has been reported to be catalytically
active in the A3 coupling (entries 6––8, Table 1).56 Traces of the desired product could be detected when no
metal source was employed (entries 9 and 10, Table 1). This is probably because of the high temperature,
in combination with traces of metal salts present in the reaction
vessel. A significant improvement in the reaction yield was achieved
by employing Zn(OTf)2 in toluene (entry 11, Table 1). However, the 90% yield threshold
was crossed only when Zn(OAc)2 was used and the reaction
was carried out under neat conditions (entry 12, Table 1). To our surprise, even though
zinc acetate dihydrate has been reported to be catalytically active
in toluene in the case of the A3 coupling between benzaldehyde,
piperidine, and phenylacetylene, the same reaction did not work under
neat conditions at 120 °C.44 ZnBr2 and ZnI2 also showed high catalytic activities
in the absence of solvent, with the latter leading to a similar outcome
with Zn(OAc)2 (entries 13 and 14, Table 1). We did not investigate ZnI2 further, at this stage, because this salt is known for its ability
to mediate the formation of trisubstituted allenes from pyrrolidine-derived
tetrasubstituted propargylamines and, therefore, could lead to complications
during the investigation of the reaction scope.53b The activity of zinc halides correlates with their Lewis
acidity;57 however, no conclusions can
be drawn based on this fact alone, as the relationship between the
nature of the corresponding zinc acetylides and other intermediates
involved in the cycle might be rather complex, especially in the absence
of solvent. Of note, Zn(OTf)2 is active under neat conditions
as well; however, it also leads to unwanted side reactions, which
inhibit efficient conversion to propargylamine 4a (result
not shown). The identification of a mild Lewis acid displaying higher
catalytic activity in the KA2 coupling under neat conditions
than in solution coincides with the earlier findings of Larsen and
co-workers,27,28 reaffirming the importance of
developing synthetic methodologies from a “green” standpoint.
Importantly, Zn(OAc)2 is less hydroscopic and easier to
handle than all zinc halides, while also being much less expensive
and more readily available than Zn(OTf)2. We chose to proceed
with the reaction conditions outlined in entry 12, as we were planning
on functionalizing demanding substrates, such as hindered prochiral
ketones and primary amines, even though milder conditions can lead
to the desired product, depending on the specific substrate triad
(vide infra).

In order to investigate the scope
of ketones, phenylacetylene was
used in combination with piperidine, pyrrolidine, or benzylamine (Scheme 2). It was quickly
established that ketones other than cyclohexanones could be successfully
subjected to this protocol, with cyclopentanone-derived propargylamine 4b obtained in 63% yield. A dramatic drop in yield was observed
when cycloheptanone was screened, possibly because of the increased
steric hindrance caused by the conformations of the intermediate ketiminium
ion (4c, Scheme 2). Linear ketones were also found to be amenable substrates,
with prochiral butanone leading to tetrasubstituted propargylamine 4d in 82% yield. Increasing the size of the alkyl chains led
to a slight decrease in yield in the cases of compounds 4e and 4j. Propargylamine 4m was obtained
in low yield; however, this was in part due to evident decomposition
during purification by column chromatography, a phenomenon which has
also been observed for other compounds of this family.33i Substituted cyclohexanones were efficiently
converted to the corresponding propargylamines (4f, 4i). Interestingly, 3-methylcyclohexanone led to a higher
diastereomeric ratio than 2-methylcyclohexanone, which is in contrast
with the results reported using a primary amine under microwave irradiation
and CuI catalysis.22 These results might
harbor mechanistic information regarding the interplay between torsional
strain and steric hindrance in the transition state formed during
the acetylide attack on the in situ-formed ketiminium ion or ketimine.
When a secondary amine is involved, the torsional strain factor possibly
becomes more significant in the case of 2-methylcyclohexanone and
the acetylide attack is not primarily controlled by steric hindrance
induced by the methyl group. In the case of 3-methylcyclohexanone,
it is possible that the angle of the acetylide attack changes when
switching from secondary to primary amines because of coordination
of the imine to the metal center of the acetylide species.28 As a result, the degree in which steric control
regarding face selection during addition is imparted by the methyl
group may change accordingly, which translates to a difference in
the diasteromeric ratios (d.r.). Even though the abovementioned differences
bare intrinsic informational value, the exact identity of the diastereoisomers
was not uncovered in neither case and, therefore, unambiguous conclusions
regarding stereocontrol cannot be drawn. It is important to note that
the exact nature of the metal acetylide, as well as other factors
contributing to π-face selection render the reasons for these
differences far from obvious.58,59 High yields and remarkably
high diastereoselectivities were obtained when norbornanone was used
in combination with pyrrolidine and piperidine, leading to single
diastereoisomers of tetrasubstituted propargylamines 4g and 4h, respectively. Benzylamine was also successfully
coupled with norbornanone and phenylacetylene, albeit leading to a
substantially lower yield of propargylamine 4k, a fact
which is attributed to the increased stability of the intermediate
imine. This intermediate was clearly observed by GC/MS analysis, even
after increasing the reaction time to 50 h, which did not lead to
an increase in product yield. The level of diastereoselectivity, however,
was still maintained, despite the relatively lower yield.29 Unfortunately, when α-tetralone was used,
no conversion to the desired product was observed under these conditions
(4l). Of note, only one catalytic system capable of functionalizing
aromatic ketones via the KA2 coupling has been reported
to date.31

(see Supporting Information).

Decomposition during column chromatography
was observed, as suggested by the respective color changes.

Prompted by the exceptionally high diastereoselectivities
observed
for the norbornanone derivatives, we attempted to elucidate the structure
of 4h. As shown in Figure 1, the obtained compound could be either endo-4h or exo-4h. Based on
the related literature, nucleophiles tend to add to norbornanone from
the exo side, giving very high diastereoselectivities.18a,60 The same also applies to alkynyl-metal reagents.61,62 A combination of 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H, 1H-COSY, 1H, 13C-HSQC, and 1H, 1H-NOESY spectroscopies (see Supporting Information) leads to the conclusion that the piperidine
unit resides on the endo side of the molecule. Because of the complexity
of the acquired spectra, our conclusion is not definitive, but in
conjunction with the known propensity of nucleophiles to add to norbornanone
from the exo side, the data suggest exo alkynylation. Of note, the
same should apply in the cases of products 4g and 4k.

Figure 1 Diastereoisomers of 4h with labeled atoms.

Continuing with the scope of alkynes (Scheme 3), mostly piperidine
and cyclohexanone were
coupled with various terminal alkynes to give new propargylamines.
Electron-donating groups on the aromatic alkynes had little effect
on the reaction outcome, leading to products 4n, 4q, and 4r in good yields. A detrimental effect
on the reaction outcome was observed when aromatic alkynes bearing
electron-withdrawing groups were used. Product 4o was
observed by GC/MS analysis; however, its isolation proved difficult,
while product 4p was not detected. These results are
in agreement with the fact that electron-deficient alkynes are rarely
used in similar studies,31 leading to poor
results, attributed to the decreased nucleophilicity of the corresponding
metal acetylides. In our case, the competing pathway of alkyne hydroamination
was identified as the main issue. Surprisingly, product 4s was efficiently obtained in 70% yield after column chromatography. 1H NMR analysis of related fractions showcased the existence
of the corresponding hydroamination product. This new propargylamine
bears a particularly useful handle for further synthetic elaboration.
In order to probe whether useful aliphatic alkynes could participate
in the KA2 coupling under zinc catalysis, 2-methyl-3-butynol
was used in combination with cyclohexanone and p-fluorobenzylamine.63 The highly functionalized, tetrasubstituted
propargylamine 4t was successfully obtained in moderate
yield.

The N-phenylpiperazine scaffold is frequently
observed as a key component in biologically active compounds and,
therefore, has proven useful in combinatorial synthesis.64 In light of that, we thought the KA2 coupling of N-phenylpiperazine with 2-methyl-3-butynol
and cyclohexanone would lead to interesting results. Indeed, propargylamine 4u (Scheme 3) was obtained under the standard conditions; however, an unprecedented
occurrence was also observed in this case. Copious amounts of a white
solid precipitated from the reaction mixture, which was filtered off
using ethyl acetate, prior to the purification of the desired compound.
Under our presumption that this solid was N-phenylpiperazinium
acetate,65 the latter was synthesized by
directly mixing N-phenylpiperazine and acetic acid
and the 1H- and 13C NMR spectra of the two solids
were compared (see Supporting Information). Both N-phenylpiperazine and acetate groups could
be identified in the unknown compound in a 1:1 ratio, with peaks in 13C NMR being slightly displaced (1––3 ppm),
when compared with those of N-phenylpiperazinium
acetate. Comparison of the 1H NMR and Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra clearly shows that the unknown
compound is not N-phenylpiperazinium acetate, but
possibly an N-phenylpiperazine-coordinated zinc complex,
which is in agreement with recent reports on amine coordination to
zinc in related processes.66 Unfortunately,
attempts to identify the compound by high resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) analysis only confirmed the existence of N-phenylpiperazine.57 The fact that N-phenylpiperazine and the acetate anions are present in
a 1:1 ratio, as suggested by 1H NMR analysis, prompted
us to embark upon further investigations, in order to gain more insight
regarding the components of this complex. IR analysis suggested that
hydroxide species could also be present in this compound,67 which can be explained considering that water
is a byproduct of the KA2 coupling (see Supporting Information). Direct mixing of N-phenylpiperazine (1.0 equiv) with anhydrous zinc acetate (0.2 equiv),
followed by heating at 120 °C and then washing the resulting
precipitate with diethyl ether afforded the same complex, as judged
by NMR and FTIR spectroscopies (see Supporting Information). Furthermore, 1H NMR spectra of (a) N-phenylpiperazinium acetate, (b) the solid that precipitated
from the reaction, and (c) the solid that precipitated as a result
of directly mixing N-phenylpiperazine (1.0 equiv)
and anhydrous zinc acetate (0.2 equiv) were obtained in a sequential
manner and addition of D2O to the samples showcased that
the complex decomposes in the presence of water (see Supporting Information). Based on these results, we believe
that this compound is an off-cycle zinc complex (general structure 5, Scheme 4). Despite our repeated attempts, it was not possible to obtain single
crystals of good quality that would enable the X-ray structure elucidation
of this compound. Although the exact structure of the obtained solid
was not determined beyond any doubt, the above results suggest the
formation of amine-coordinated zinc species during the catalytic cycle
and also suggest that using bidentate amines might cause complications
under the conditions reported herein.

Scheme 4 Isolation of a Complex
Originating from Zinc Acetate and N-Phenylpiperazine
For the first installment in
the scope of amines, pyrrolidine was
used in combination with cyclohexanone and phenylacetylene to furnish
propargylamine 4v in 96% isolated yield (Scheme 5). It is interesting to note
that, for this compound, when the catalyst loading and temperature
were lowered to 5.0 mol % Zn(OAc)2 and 110 °C, respectively,
an 83% isolated yield was reached. Also, under the standard conditions,
an 83% isolated yield was obtained after 4 h, while a 96% yield was
reached after 8 h. Propargylamine 4w, bearing a versatile
ester handle for further synthetic elaboration was obtained in 67%
isolated yield under the standard conditions. Benzylamine led to product 4x in 71% isolated yield, while the same compound was obtained
in 17% yield when Zn(OTf)2 in 20% loading was used in toluene
(1.0 M) in preliminary studies.38 Product 4y was obtained in slightly lower yield, possibly because
of steric hindrance, while products 4z and 4e were obtained in moderate yields. When morpholine was used, the
corresponding propargylamine (4za) was obtained in a
lower yield than expected, possibly owing to the bidentate nature
of this cyclic amine. N-octylamine led to the desired
product (4zc) in good yield, while a hindered secondary
amine was also amenable to this catalytic system (4zb). Increasing the steric bulk of the amine proved detrimental to
the reaction outcome in the case of propargylamine 4ze, while a primary amine bearing a hindered, secondary amine site
led to product 4zg in moderate yield.

The derivatization of nicotine has been
a topic of continuous interest
and, therefore, we became interested in the potential outcome of using
the biologically relevant nornicotine (2c, Scheme 6) as the amine component in
the KA2 coupling.68 The corresponding
propargylamine was obtained as a single diastereoisomer in 70% isolated
yield (4zf, Scheme 5). However, the case of propargylamine 4zf was particularly interesting, as this compound precipitated in crystalline
form after ethyl acetate was used to filter off inorganic compounds
from the reaction mixture (Scheme 6). As a result, this compound was obtained in the pure
form without the need for column chromatography. Of note, propargylic
amines are usually obtained as viscous oils after chromatographic
purification using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate, a fact which
inarguably compromises the sustainable aspects of their multicomponent
synthesis and is rarely addressed. Although it is obvious that sustainable
methods of purification depend on the exact nature of a specific compound,
we found that the use of nornicotine in such a manner might prove
useful in studies of propargylic amines. Interestingly, nornicotine
is naturally occurring, biologically relevant, and possesses a bulky
pyridine group able to dictate face selection during the acetylide
attack. Also, the pyrrolidine framework is particularly useful for
synthetic applications of propargylic amines.51,53b,53c

Scheme 6 Synthesis and Purification
of a Nornicotine-Derived, Crystalline
Propargylamine: Column Chromatography Can Be Circumvented
In order to assess the scalability
of our protocol,30 the synthesis of 1-(1-(phenylethynyl)cyclohexyl)pyrrolidine
(4v) was carried out on a gram scale, using equimolar
amounts of starting materials and 10 mol % Zn(OAc)2 (Scheme 7). The product was
efficiently obtained in 91% isolated yield and adequate purity after
a simple filtration through a pad of silica using ethyl acetate and
evaporation of the (recyclable) solvent. This is indicative of the
mild Lewis acidity of Zn(OAc)2, given that byproduct formation
is minimized and, therefore, the product can be obtained in high yield
in a straightforward, user-friendly, and cost-efficient fashion. As
the chemistry of ZnI2 and propargylamines is of high interest53a,53b and we found that ZnI2 is able to mediate the formation
of tetrasubstituted propargylamines under neat conditions, we deemed
it necessary to explore whether allenes could be produced in a one-pot
fashion using only ZnI2. Indeed, trisubstituted allene 6 was obtained in 20% isolated yield, without prior isolation
of its propargylamine precursor, following a one-pot procedure (Scheme 7, also see Supporting Information). Propargylamine 4v was still present in the reaction mixture, possibly because
of the deactivation of the catalyst by 1 equivalent of water generated
by the KA2 reaction. Repeating the reaction under neat
conditions with 0.8 equiv of ZnI2 resulted in consumption
of propargylamine 4v to give a series of unidentified
products, possibly arising from cycloaddition reactions of the produced
allene.69 These results are highly important,
proving that generation of trisubstituted allenes is feasible under
our conditions and may provide a novel possible gateway to developing
synthetic protocols for their preparation.53c

from Pyrrolidine, Ketones and Terminal Alkynes
Isolated
yields are shown.

Based on our observations,
as well as on previous studies on the
KA2 coupling,28 we propose a
plausible, zinc-based catalytic cycle (Scheme 8). The cycle commences with the formation
of a π-complex between alkyne 3 and Zn(OAc)2, which is transformed into a zinc acetylide (3′) by the action of amine substrate 2. Therefore, the
intermediates involved in the next steps are generated in step I. Step II is the reversible formation of ketiminum
ion or imine intermediates 7 and 7′, respectively, depending on whether a secondary or primary amine
is involved. In the case of secondary amines, the zinc acetylide attack
on the ketiminium ion in step III should lead directly
to the formation of product 4 and regeneration of the
catalyst, while, if a primary amine is involved, a proto-demetallation
step (IV) should facilitate product release. The addition
of the metal acetylide to the ketiminium ion or imine intermediate
is considered to be rate-determining. Step V represents
a possible catalyst deactivation pathway, with the interaction of
amine substrates and in situ produced water with zinc, giving coordination
complexes that might be either off-cycle species, or able to participate
in the next cycle, depending on their exact nature. It is important
to mention that although the addition of zinc acetylides to electrophiles
is usually considered to involve mononuclear zinc species, recent
advancements regarding the elucidation of a dinuclear mode of action
of zinc catalysts should also be taken into consideration.66,70

Scheme 8 The KA2 Coupling Reaction under Zinc Catalysis: Proposed
Mechanism
Conclusions
The
identification of zinc acetate as a mild Lewis acid catalyst
for the KA2 coupling has led to the development of a reliable,
highly efficient, user-friendly, cost-efficient, green catalytic system
for the expedient assembly of propargylic amines bearing tetrasubstituted
carbon centers. This advancement highlights the potential of efforts
toward the design of green synthetic methodology, as it clearly demonstrates
the improvement or even the emergence of catalytic activity in the
absence of solvent. The combination of sustainable zinc catalysis,
neat conditions, and the multicomponent synthesis of propargylamines
renders this system an arguably ideal example in terms of atom and
step economy. In light of that, integrating homogeneous zinc catalysis
into the KA2 coupling reaction raises some interesting
points. Zinc alone, is up to the task, when it comes to the construction
of propargylamines deriving from nearly all substrate types. In this
regard, even though cyclohexanone leads to the best results, the efficient
functionalization of sterically demanding cyclohexanones, as well
as bicyclic ketones, such as norbornanone is also feasible. Notably,
linear and also prochiral ketones are amenable substrates when zinc
acetylides are the active nucleophiles, thus potentially setting the
stage for an enantioselective version of this reaction. Under the
same conditions, primary amines led to the corresponding propargylamines
in isolated yields ranging from 33 to 71%, depending on the remaining
two reaction components. Slight modification of the reaction conditions
for each triad of substrates could improve the yield and, therefore,
each independent reaction should be approached accordingly for synthetic
purposes. Another promising discovery disclosed herein, is the highly
sustainable synthesis and purification of a nornicotine-derived propargylic
amine, which could prove to be especially useful either as a synthon
or as a template for further studies on this reaction and its products.
Also, the unprecedented ability of zinc iodide to mediate the direct
formation of trisubstituted allenes, from ketones, pyrrolidine, and
terminal alkynes, holds great promise, as new protocols for accessing
such valuable molecules might be developed through appropriate optimization.
As a final note, despite all the major advancements, the KA2 coupling is arguably still in its infancy and, as is the case with
the majority of newly found, metal-catalyzed reactions, rationally
designed systems are expected to emerge as a result of a gradual increase
in the understanding of its underlying mechanistic parameters. A prerequisite
of such design is the discovery of new metals that can catalyze this
process, with zinc being the latest addition, providing a unique range
of options for new advancements. Studies on improvements and extensions
of the green system reported herein, as well as the development of
new ones are already underway in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General
Reagent Information
All chemicals were obtained
from commercial sources and were used without any further purification,
with the exception of cyclohexanone, which was distilled before use.
All metal sources were anhydrous and at least 98% pure. Zinc acetate
anhydrous (99.99%) and zinc acetate anhydrous (98%) gave indistinguishable
results. Toluene was purified according to published procedures, distilled
and stored under argon over 3 Å molecular sieves. All reactions
were set up under air and carried out in flame-dried, Teflon seal
screw-cap pressure tubes under an atmosphere of argon. The course
of the reactions was followed with either GC/MS or thin-layer chromatography,
using aluminum sheets (0.2 mm) coated with silica gel 60 with fluorescence
material that absorbs at 254 nm (silica gel 60 F254). The purification
of the products was carried out by flash column chromatography, using
silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh). FTIR spectra were recorded with
a Shimandzu IRAffinity-1 spectrometer, using KBr pellets.

General Analytical
Information
1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were measured on a Varian
Mercury 200 MHz or a Bruker Advance 500 MHz spectrometer, using CDCl3 as the solvent and its residual solvent peak as a reference.
NMR spectroscopic data are given in the order: chemical shift, multiplicity
(s, singlet, br s, broad singlet, d, doublet, t, triplet, q, quartet,
m, multiplet), coupling constant in hertz (Hz), and number of protons.
HRMS spectra were recorded in a QTOF maXis impact (Bruker) spectrometer
with electron spray ionization (ESI). The GC/MS spectra were recorded
with a Shimandzu R GCMS-QP2010 Plus Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer
using a MEGAR (MEGA-5, F.T: 0.25 μm, I.D.: 0.25 mm, L: 30 m, Tmax: 350 °C,
column ID# 11475) column, using n-octane as the internal
standard. 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HSQC, and NOESY) were measured on
a Bruker ADVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as the
solvent.

General Procedure
Unless otherwise noted, the following
procedure was used for the synthesis of all products: a flame-dried,
Teflon seal screw-cap pressure tube equipped with a stirring bar and
a rubber septum was charged with 20 mol % Zn(OAc)2 (73.4
mg, 0.4 mmol). Under a flow of argon, 2.0 mmol of the amine was added
and the mixture was stirred until the solid was partially dissolved.
2.0 mmol of the alkyne was added and the mixture was stirred at room
temperature and under argon until the solid was either completely
or partially dissolved. Finally, 2.2 mmol of the ketone was added
and the rubber septum was quickly replaced by a Teflon seal screw-cap
under argon pressure. The reaction was allowed to stir in an oil bath,
preheated at 120 °C, for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature,
ethyl acetate was added (2 × 5 mL) and the mixture was stirred
for 5 min in order to completely remove the usually viscous product
from the reaction vessel. The mixture was filtered through a short
silica gel plug in order to remove inorganic impurities, concentrated
under vacuum and loaded atop a silica gel column. Gradient column
chromatography with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether furnished the desired
products. All products were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, 19F NMR, and HRMS, which
were all in agreement with the assigned structures.
