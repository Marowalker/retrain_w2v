Overuse of chemical fertilizers in
the intensive greenhouse tomato
cultivation system has limited the increase of plant production. Nowadays,
seaweed extract has been gradually applied in agriculture as an effective
way to achieve a higher yield of crops, but its effects on tomato
cultivation have not been fully explored. In this study, a greenhouse
experiment was conducted in Shandong province of China with a novel
seaweed extract (SES) originated from Sargassum horneri, to investigate the effects of different doses of SES (0, 30, 60,
and 90 kg hm–2) on yields, quality, ripening time,
and net returns of tomato. The results indicated that the application
of SES significantly increased tomato yield by 4.6–6.9% compared
to the control, which is attributed to the improved photosynthetic
capacity of tomato leaves. The yields of tomato increased first and
then decreased with increasing dosage of SES, and SES applied at the
dose of 60 kg hm–2 achieved the highest tomato yield.
Compared to the control, SES at 60 and 90 kg hm–2 significantly increased the hardness of tomato by 10.2 and 19.8%,
respectively, and this can help to reduce losses during transportation
and storage. Moreover, SES shortened the ripening time of tomato,
and the coincidence between tomato harvest and sale price peak achieved
a high net return.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Tomato,
the highest-value fruit/vegetable with extensive worldwide
distribution, has gradually become the preferred crop for many commercial
growers in Northern China.1 Greenhouse
is the most suitable facility for continuous growth of tomatoes because
of its precise regulation of the condition of water, heat, and fertilizer.
To achieve a higher yield, tomatoes are generally cultivated with
a greater degree of management, larger input of nutrients, and more
precise irrigation, especially in China, where smallholder farms dominate.2−4 Based on the principle of diminishing returns,5 continuous application of fertilizers hardly improved the
yields and nutrient use efficiency of tomato, but caused a series
of environmental pollution stemming from the leaching,6 runoff,7 and volatilization
of excessive nutrients.8 Therefore, novel
nonfertilization measures to promote tomato production as well as
to ensure farmers’ income are critical for the development
of sustainable agriculture.

Seaweed is an inexpensive and extensive
resource along coastal
agricultural areas, and it also has a great potential for commercial
exploitation. Seaweed extracts isolated from seaweed, which contain
a wide range of macronutrient and microelement nutrients and organic
components such as growth hormones, amino acids, vitamins, betaines,
cytokinins, and sterols,9,10 have played an important
role in the development of the environment-friendly crops planting
system.11−15 In general, seaweed extracts can induce changes in the physiological/biochemical
process in agriculture associated with nutrient uptake and growth
of plants. For example, seaweed extracts promoted early seed germination
and establishment,11 boosted root growth,
increased leaf chlorophyll,16 improved
crop performance and yield of tomato,17,18 and elevated
resistance to biotic/abiotic stress.19,20 In addition,
seaweed extracts also affected the physical, chemical, and biological
properties of soil. Seaweed extracts could combine soil metal ions
to produce colloids and protect the soil aggregate structure.21 Richardson also noted that a seaweed extract
originated from Ascophyllum nodosum could replace EDTA to chelate trace elements.22 Noteworthily, the benefits stemming from seaweed extracts
are mainly attributed to their stimulation on plant growth but not
to their provision on nutrients.11 Thus,
seaweed extracts may construct a bridge between crops and fertilizer,
serving a balance between agricultural input markets and economic
benefit.

Economic benefit is the biggest concern for commercial
growers
in actual tomato production. In China, the income from tomato plantation
is affected by its yield and quality, and especially its ripening
time. More concretely, during the Mid-Autumn Festival and Spring Festival,
the unit price of various vegetables increases with dramatic demands.
Regulating the ripening time artificially during festivals can help
the growers to obtain a higher price of tomato in the fierce market
competition. Seaweed extracts have been confirmed to contain cytokinins,23,24 auxins,25 and ABA-like growth substances,12 which theoretically promoted early ripening
of crops by their synergistic activity.26 Some papers also showed that the ability of seaweed extracts to
regulate the ripening time was attributed to their effects on modulating
the metabolism and catabolism of plant endogenous growth regulators.27,28 Moreover, it was reported that medium or late application of the
seaweed extract could be a useful method to regulate the ripening
dynamics and boost the fruit quality of grapes for production of premium
red wines.29 Therefore, controlling the
ripening time of tomatoes by applying seaweed extracts can be a promising
measure to increase farmers’ income by the way of ensuring
tomato yield. However, the effects of seaweed extracts on the ripening
time of tomato and the resulting economic benefits are not yet fully
explored.

In this work, a novel seaweed extract (SES) obtained
from Sargassum horneri was employed
to study its effects
on the yield, quality, and ripening time of tomato. Before SES was
applied, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 1H NMR
spectroscopy were utilized to understand its basic structure and composition.
Subsequently, a greenhouse experiment with SES at three levels (30,
60, and 90 kg hm2) was conducted to explore its effects
on tomato growth in North China. The objectives of this study were
to investigate: (i) the influence of the SES application rate on the
yield and quality of tomato; (ii) the effect of the SES application
rate on the photosynthetic capacity and soil physical/chemical properties
of tomato; and (iii) the ripening time of tomato as affected by different
amounts of SES.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Different Amounts of SES on Single
Harvest and Total Yield of Tomato
Tomato yields were obviously
affected by the amount of SES (Table 1). Compared to CK, SES30, SES60, and SES90 significantly
increased the total yields of tomato by 4.6, 6.9, and 4.7%, respectively.
Our results were consistent with the report described in previous
studies that seaweed extracts improved the yield of tomato,10,17,30 but the increased yield was relatively
lower than that reported by Crouch and van Staden.30 The reason is that the long history for continuous growing
of tomato with high nutrients input made it hard for yield improvement
and the difference in application method of seaweed extract (foliar
or soil application) had different yield improvement effect.30 The increase of yield in the SES-treated plant
can be associated with the hormonal substances in SES, especially
cytokinin,10 which can promote the mobilization
of nutrients and trigger fruit set. Crouch13 also noted that seaweed extracts increased the root length of tomato,
improved the uptake of nutrients, and then boosted the yield.

a Mean values followed by the same
lowercase letter were not significantly different at the 0.05 probability

multiple range tests within the same column.

Considering the continuous harvest character of tomato,
tomato
yields on every single harvest were also compared. The first harvest
of tomato was on 14 January 2018, and SES30, SES60, and SES90 increased
the yield by 82.1, 104.6, and 131.6% compared to CK treatment, respectively
(Table 1). SES30, SES60,
and SES90 treatments also significantly increased the second harvest
yield of tomato by 43.8, 60.0, and 67.8% compared to CK treatment,
respectively. On the third harvest, no significant difference was
observed between the yield of SES90 treatment and CK treatment. But
on the fourth, fifth, and sixth harvests, tomato yields under SES30,
SES60, and SES90 treatment were significantly reduced by 21.2–27.5,
13.1–24.2, and 23.8–31.3% compared to CK treatment,
respectively. The increased yield in the early harvest stages indicated
that the application of SES shortened the fruit-ripening time (days
from anthesis to ripening) of tomato.31 The photos taken on 21 January 2018 further confirmed the results
as more fully ripe red tomatoes existed on the plants applied with
SES (Figure 1). Seaweed
extracts contain cytokinins,23,24 auxins,25 and ABA-like growth substances10 and these hormonal substances have been shown to have a
stimulatory effect on plant growth and fruit maturity.26−29 We speculated that the precocity of tomato affected by SES may be
related to its capacity to trigger early flowing and fruit set,10 and then shortened the fruit-ripening time of
tomato.

2.2 Effects of Different Amounts
of SES on the
Economic Benefits of Tomato
The unit price of tomatoes is
affected by market factors, and this means that tomato will have disparate
profit due to the sale prices at different harvest times. In the present
study, the tomato harvest period lasted 42 days and across China’s
Spring Festival. In China, the harvest time that is near the Spring
Festival can get a relative higher price. The price of tomato fluctuates
between 0.62 and 1.11 $ kg–1 according to the local
sale price (Table 2). The maximum and minimum sale price gap is 1.8 times. In addition,
the sale price of tomato in the early harvest stage was higher than
that in the last three harvest stages. Eventually, the total profits
in SES30, SES60, and SES90 treatments were 10.1, 13.6, and 9.9 higher
than that in CK treatment, which means that the application of SES
can be a reliable means to achieve more benefits when cultivated in
autumn and harvested during the Spring Festival.

total; SES costs were $4.1, $8.2, and $12.3 greenhouse–1 time–1 for SES30 SES60, and SES90 treatments,
4 times in total; labor cost included plot arrangement, tomato picking,
fertilization, and irrigation, $153.8 greenhouse–1; other costs included seedings, pesticides, transport, and other
materials and expenses, 769.2 greenhouse–1.

2.3 Effects of SES Amounts
on SPAD, Chlorophyll
Content, and Photosynthetic Characteristics of Tomato Leaves
The SPAD values were considerably affected by the application of
SES. Leaf SPADs in SES30, SES60, and SES90 treatment were significantly
increased by 9.6, 8.5, and 9.5% compared to CK treatment, respectively
(Table 3). The SPAD
value has a good correlation with chlorophyll content, and the chlorophyll
content in SES30, SES60, and SES90 treatments was significantly increased
by 25.3, 18.9, and 16.6% compared to CK treatment, respectively. Numerous
studies also confirmed that leaf chlorophyll content positively increased
with the application of seaweed extract,32−34 which precisely
coincided with our results. Blunden35 found
that the application of seaweed extract had a higher chlorophyll content
than unapplied treatments, which might be attributed to the reduction
in chlorophyll degradation caused by betaines in the seaweed extract.
Besides, some researchers found that the application of seaweed increased
the leaf surface area.27 Nevertheless,
there was no significant difference in both SPAD value and chlorophyll
content between the treatments when applied with different amounts
of SES.

a Mean values followed

lowercase letter were not significantly different at the 0.05 probability
level based on one-way ANOVAs followed by Duncan’s multiple
range tests within the same column.

Photosynthesis is the basis for crops to capture solar
energy and
accumulate nutrients. The photosynthetic capacity of leaves directly
determines the level of plant productivity. In the present study,
Pn in SES30, SES60, and SES90 treatments was significantly increased
by 17.5, 31.1, and 31.7% compared to CK treatment, respectively (Table 3). This may accelerate
the accumulation of nutrients in plants, thereby promoting the maturation
and increasing the yield of tomatoes. Moreover, Pn has been widely
used as an indicator to estimate plant senescence, and the improvement
of Pn in SES30, SES60, and SES90 indicated that the application of
SES delayed the leaf senescence of tomato. Gs of SES30, SES60, and
SES90 was significantly increased by 23.0, 26.2, and 31.3% compared
to CK treatment, respectively, which means that SES can boost the
gas exchange in tomato leaves. Moreover, Ci in CK acquired the highest
since more CO2 is needed as the raw material in the treatment
with high Pn. But there was no evidence that the SES application has
a significant effect on Tr in leaves.

2.4 Effects
of SES Amounts on Soil Physical/Chemical
Properties and Nutrient Supply Intensity
In actual greenhouse
production, available soil nutrient contents were extremely higher
owing to the habitually excessive soluble fertilizer input for higher
yield.2−4 In this work, the average content of NO3–, available P, and available K of soil also reached
a very high level (more than 40, 90, and 430 mg kg–1, respectively) after all of the tomatoes were harvested (Table 4). Previous papers
reported that several seaweeds contained high ratios of elements like
Ca, P, and K.36 Although the K and ash
contents of the SES were up to 6.6 and 30.2%, respectively, no obvious
difference was observed in the NO3– content,
NH4+ content, available P, and available K of
soil among all of the treatments (Table 4), which is precisely consistent with the
concept of biostimulants defined by European Biostimulant Industry
Council (EBIC): “Biostimulants operate through different mechanisms
than fertilizers, regardless of the presence of nutrients in the products”.11 Under the condition of such fertile soil, the
yield of tomatoes was markedly increased by 4.6–6.9% with the
application of SES, providing an environment-friendly way for crop
cultivation in greenhouse. In the future, whether the amount of fertilizer
can be reduced by adding SES while maintaining the gain yield is worth
to be validated.

Content Under Different Amounts of SESa

a Mean values followed by the same
lowercase letter were not significantly different at the 0.05 probability
level based on one-way ANOVAs followed by Duncan’s multiple
range tests within the same column.

Soil EC values in SES30, SES60, and SES90 treatments
were significantly
decreased by 16.3, 25.3, and 26.0% compared to CK treatment (Table 4). The greater the
EC value, the higher the content of soluble salts.37,38 The decreased EC value in SES30, SES60, and SES90 treatments indicated
that SES can reduce the leaching or runoff of nutrients into the environment.
The decreased EC value may be attributed to the precipitate/chelate
character of SES with some alkaline ions in the soil and the existence
of polyuronides in SES with gelling, chelating, and hydrophilic properties
such as alginates and fucoidans.15

2.5 Effects of the Amount of SES on Tomato Quality
Quality
is an important factor for sustaining higher unit price
of tomato. Tomato quality includes appearance character such as single
fruit weight and hardness, as well as intrinsic aspect represented
by nutrient content and mouthfeel. In the present study, although
single tomato weight, soluble solids, titratable acid, and vitamin
C content of tomato showed no significant difference in all of the
treatments, the soluble sugar content in tomato was markedly increased
with the application of SES (Table 5), thereby increasing the sugar/acid ratio and achieving
a better flavor and taste. But there was no significant difference
among the treatments with different amounts of SES.

Moreover, the hardness of tomato
was markedly increased with the
increasing dose of SES (Table 5). The hardness of tomato in SES60 and SES90 was 10.2 and
19.8% higher than that in CK treatment, respectively. Therefore, the
application of SES can reduce the loss during transportation and storage
by increasing the hardness of the tomato. Stasio38 noted that seaweed extracts increased the Ca2+ content of tomato by more than 20%, which helps to explain the mechanism
of SES for the increase of hardness.

2.6 Chemical
Structure and Composition of SES
The effectiveness of seaweed
extracts was markedly influenced by
their sources, structure, and composition.39 Therefore, a thorough understanding of SES by characterization is
necessary for their efficient utilization. For instance, Stasio38 confirmed via the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
analysis that the seaweed extract was rich in bioactive compounds,
which was possibly beneficial to the growth and stress adaptation
of tomato. Khan10 summarized several chemical
analyses of seaweeds and seaweed extracts and revealed the presence
of a wide variety of plant growth-promoting substances such as auxins,
cytokinins, and betaines. Despite evidence from the literature for
the role/effects of these substances as single molecules on plant
growth and stress protection, the diverse and complex nature of seaweed
extracts makes it difficult to establish a univocal cause of the various
biostimulant effects observed. Therefore, there is a need for an in-depth
analysis of the functional specificities.

SES contains 29.2%
of alginic acid, 14.1% of crude protein, 10.9% of mannitol, 30.2%
of ash, 6.6% of potassium, 0.024% of iodine, as well as a variety
of plant hormones (the date was provided by Worldfull Agricultural
Technology Co., Ltd., Shandong, China). Furthermore, the analysis
of size exclusion chromatography provided a clear insight into the
molecular weight (MW) distribution of SES with a range of 179–11 949
Da (Figure 2). The
proportion of the relatively low MW fraction (MW < 5 kDa) was up
to 87.8%, and the higher MW (MW > 5 kDa) was only 12.2%. Therefore,
SES was a biostimulant with lower MW than other seaweed extracts,40 which can be easily absorbed by the tomato root.
Detailed structural information and the relative distribution of main
structures were obtained by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 3). SES exhibited
a stronger predominance of aromatic protons (δ(1H)
= 9.5–6.5 ppm) than alkyl protons (δ(1H) =
1.9–0.5 ppm). The proton content (δ(1H) =
4.9–3.1 ppm) on C atoms directly bonded to N, O, or carbohydrates
is up to 57.87% (Table S1). The signals
at 4.5–3.2 ppm also can be the source of H in methylene groups
and/or aminomethine groups [−CH(NH−)]. The signals at
6.5–6.0 ppm can be attributed to double bonds. Although many
of the various chemical components of SES and their modes of action
remain unknown, it is plausible that these components exhibit synergistic
activity.

3 Conclusions
Results suggested that tomato yield was significantly increased
by SES, which is attributed to its positive biological stimulation
on the photosynthetic capacity improvement of tomato leaves, rather
than providing nutrients as a fertilizer. The application of SES shortened
the fruit-ripening time of tomato, and hence can be a reliable means
to achieve higher benefits when cultivated in autumn and harvested
during China’s Spring Festival. Moreover, SES increased the
hardness of tomato. These results show that the use of seaweed extracts
is a suitable method for tomato growth and development in sustainable
agricultural systems.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Experimental Sites and Materials
The experimental site
is located at Fangcun town (117°20′37″
E, 35°97′03″ N), Shandong Province, China, the
largest professional production and wholesale base for tomatoes. It
belongs to the warm-temperature semihumid monsoon climate, with an
annual mean temperature of 13 °C and precipitation of
700 mm. The greenhouse has 12 years cropping history of continuous
growing tomato two seasons per year. The rectangular greenhouses are
70 m long and 10.5 m wide, with one side wall (3.6 m high) and two
end walls constructed from soil and brick (Figure S1). The main properties of top-layer soil (0–20 cm)
at the experimental site in 2017 before tomato planting were: pH,
6.65 (2.5:1, the ratio of water to soil), soil total N concentration,
1.83 g kg–1; organic matter concentration, 21.50
g kg–1; NO3––N
concentration, 30.73 mg kg–1; NH4+–N concentration, 10.25 mg kg–1;
available P concentration; 25.71 mg kg–1; and available
K concentration, 180.58 mg kg–1, respectively.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill,
Jinpeng 11), a member of the pink tomato varieties, was selected as
the testing crop. The SES extracted from S. horneri was freely provided by Worldfull Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd.
(Yantai, Shandong, China), and it contains 29.2% of alginic acid,
14.08% of crude protein, 10.94% of mannitol, 30.16% of ash, 6.63%
of potassium, 0.024% of iodine, as well as a variety of plant hormones.
The extraction and production processes of SES by the company are
presented in Figure S2. The water-soluble
fertilizer (N–P2O5–K2O: 20–20–20) applied in the experiment as the nutrient
source of tomato was provided by Kingenta Ecological Engineering Co.
Ltd. (Linshu, Shandong, China).

4.2 Experimental
Design
A randomized
experiment with three replicates was conducted on 20 August 2017 in
plots considering four treatments: control without SES application
(CK), applied SES at the dose of 30 kg hm–2 (SES30),
applied SES at the dose of 60 kg hm–2 (SES60), and
applied SES at the dose of 90 kg hm–2 (SES90). Every
plot was 8.5 m long and 1.8 m wide with an area of 15.3 m2. Soil ridges (30 cm height, 30 cm width) were built to ensure independent
irrigation and drainage between adjacent plots. The tomato was transplanted
at the four-leaf stage with a density of 30 plants plot–1 (90 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants).

Based on the
local planting habits, all of the treatments were applied with organic
fertilizer (70% rice hull and 30% chicken manure uniformly blended
in advance, 150 t hm–2) as a base fertilizer 20
days before the transplantation of tomato seedlings. Fertilization
and irrigation were carried out simultaneously during the growth of
tomato. The water-soluble fertilizer (N–P2O5–K2O: 20–20–20, 195 kg hm–2 time–1) was dissolved in 400 kg
of water at a pool (Figure S3) and irrigated
by pipes every 15 days (achieve 90% of the field water-holding capacity,
eight times in total). For the application of SES, weighed SES dependent
on different treatments was dissolved in the pool and applied along
with the water-soluble fertilizer on September 27, 2017, October 26,
2017, November 26, 2017, and December 25, 2017. All replications within
each treatment were conducted according to the local agronomic practices,
receiving identical irrigation, pruning, and control of insects and
weeds.

4.3 Harvest
The harvesting process of
tomatoes lasted from January 14, 2018 to February 18, 2018 for every
7 days (six times in total). Tomatoes in each treatment were individually
weighed, counted, and measured. Plant samples were derived from the
tomatoes harvested in the third harvest stage, and the soil samples
were collected after all of the tomatoes were harvested.

4.4 Soil and Plant Sampling and Measurement
Leaf SPAD value
was estimated with a chlorophyll meter (SPAD–502,
Minolta Co., Japan) on 14 January 2018. The photosynthesis parameters
of leaves, including net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance
(Gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and transpiration
(Tr), were measured on 14 January 2018 between 9:00 to 11:00 h by
a portable photosynthetic meter (Li-6400XT, LI-COR Co.). Subsequently,
the leaves were taken off and brought back to the laboratory. The
chlorophyll of leaves was dissolved in acetone (80%)41 and measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV-2700,
Shimadzu Co., Japan).

Soil EC was measured by a conductivity
meter (DDS-11A, Inesa Co., China). Soil NO3––N and NH4+–N concentrations
were extracted by 0.01 M CaCl242 and analyzed by an AA3 Auto-analyzer (AA3-A001-02E, Bran-Luebbe
Co., Germany). Soil total N was measured by the Kjeldahl N determination
method (Douglas et al., 1980).43 The available
P concentration in soil was extracted by 0.5 M NaHCO3 at
pH 8.544 and analyzed by a Discrete Auto-analyzer
(Smart Chem 200, Alliance Co., France). The available K concentration
in soil was extracted by 1 M CH3COONH4 at pH
745 and analyzed by a flame photometer
(Model 410, Sherwood Co., England).

Tomato samples were homogeneously
smashed with a juice machine
at room temperature. Vitamin C (Vc) content was measured by the colorimetric
method.46 The concentration of soluble
solids was measured using a digital refractometer (RX-5000α,
Atago Co., Japan).47 The titratable acidity
was determined by titrating with 0.1 N NaOH of pH 8.2.48 Soluble sugar content in tomato juice was determined
using the anthrone reagent method.49

Size exclusion chromatography was performed on solutions of the
SES using a Sephadex G-100 medium gel (Code No. 17-0060-02 Pharmacia
Biotech AB). Solid-state 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed
using an Avance 600 MHz (Bruker, Karlsruhe Co., Germany) spectrometer.

4.6 Statistical Analyses
The response
parameters were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean
separation test using the Statistical Analysis System 9.2 (2010, SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Mean and standard error values were assessed
to assemble graphs using the SigmaPlot software 10 (MMIV Systat Software,
Inc., San Jose, CA).
