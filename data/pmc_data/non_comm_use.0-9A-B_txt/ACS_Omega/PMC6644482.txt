Gemini
surfactant, N,N′-dialkylcystine
2(C12Cys), derived from cystine, and a monomeric N-alkyl cysteine counterpart, (C12Cys), were
synthesized and purified. The characterization of surfactants 2(C12Cys) and (C12Cys) was made by Fourier transform
infrared, 1H NMR, and elemental analysis. The effect of
2(C12Cys) and (C12Cys) on mild steel (MS) corrosion
in 1 M HCl solution was explored as a function of their concentration
and electrolyte temperature by means of gravimetric and electrochemical
experiments (potentiodynamic polarization and Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy), surface analytical techniques (scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM)) and theoretical study. The investigated compounds
exhibited surface active properties and performed as good inhibitors
for corrosion control of mild steel (MS) in acid solution. However,
compared to monomeric (C12Cys), Gemini surfactant 2(C12Cys) showed high corrosion inhibiting ability at very low
concentration. The EIS results revealed a greater charge transfer
resistance in 2(C12Cys) solution compared to that in (C12Cys) solution. SEM/EDAX observations validate the development
of an inhibitive film by the adsorbed molecules of surfactant on the
MS surface. The AFM micrographs supported the SEM/EDAX results and
exhibited a lowering in the roughness of the corroded MS surface in
the presence of both (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys)
surfactants. Further, quantum chemical calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations were used to study the dependence of corrosion inhibiting
efficacy on the molecular structure and adsorption strength.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Mild steel (MS) is highly utilized in various industrial fields
such as petro-chemical, oil and gas, nuclear, pulp and paper, power,
and desalination. This is attributable to its high strength, malleability,
low cost, and affordability.1−3 Owing to the above-mentioned properties,
there is a desire to maximize the lifetimes of MS items, with one
of the prime causes of degradation being corrosion, specifically in
aggressive acidic environments.4,5 Acids like HCl and H2SO4 are used to pickle steel, where impurities
like stains, rust, or scales are detached from the surface.6−8 Despite it being more costly than H2SO4, HCl
pickles at a much faster speed, thereby reducing corrosion loss of
the base metal. To control base metal corrosion, various approaches
are used, with inhibitors being one of the cheapest and most familiar
methods.9−11 Compounds having heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulfur,
and oxygen with high electron density have been found to be potential
inhibitors against metal corrosion in many environments.12−15 But, a number of them are very harmful and raise environmental concerns.
Currently, the principal objective in selecting compounds to inhibit
corrosion for practical application apart from efficiency is their
eco-friendliness due to the issues of environmental pollution.

Among the class of compounds employed as corrosion inhibitors,
surfactants have the advantages of good inhibition efficiency, being
safe and easy to use, and economical production.16,17 The hydrophilic part of the molecules of surfactants facilitates
their aggregation and adsorption on metallic surfaces thus blocking
active sites on the surfaces and thereby protecting them from corrosion.18,19 Furthermore, molecules of surfactants tend to avoid the polar aqueous
phase by associating and aggregating their hydrophobic hydrocarbon
chains together.20

Among the surfactants,
Gemini surfactants (double chain) have attracted
the attention of the scientific community because of their better
aggregation properties than those of traditional single chain surfactants.21,22 Gemini surfactants obtained from amino acids have attracted significant
interest in the recent past as they are reported to be biocompatible
and biodegradable surfactants that fulfill the requirements of biological
and ecological compatibility23,24 with enhanced performance
for biomedical and technological implementation.

In this work,
we provide a complete view of the Gemini surfactant
based on the amino acid cystine,25 which
is designated as 2(C12Cys), where C represent the number
of C atoms in the hydrophobic chain moiety, from the viewpoint of
synthesis and corrosion protection performance, and compare to a cysteine-based
monomeric surfactant, which is designated as (C12Cys).
Cysteine is an α-amino acid, which contains not only carboxyl
[−COOH] and amino [−NH2] functional groups,
but also a [−SH] group. It has the capability to control corrosion
by coordinating with metals through the N atom, O atom of the carboxyl
group, and S atom of the thiol group, which could explain the interest
of this molecule as a potential inhibitor for MS. The novelty in the
current study stems from the fact that Yoshimura et al.25 only investigated the adsorption and aggregation
properties of these compounds, whereas for the first time in the literature,
we have established the anticorrosive properties of these compounds
in the corrosion of MS in acid solution employing advanced experimental
techniques and theoretical calculations. The anticorrosion performance
was investigated by gravimetric measurements, electrochemical measurements
(potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS)), and surface assessment techniques (scanning electron
microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM)). The anticorrosion performances of 2(C12Cys) and (C12Cys) are correlated with quantum
chemical parameters and Monte Carlo simulations in expectation that
the interrelationship will be assistive in the design and synthesis
of new inhibitors with higher inhibition efficiency.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Critical Micelle Concentration
(CMC) Determination
CMC values of 2(C12Cys) and
(C12Cys) were
obtained in 1 M HCl aqueous solution from the change in the slope
of the plotted data of γ versus the solute concentration (log C), see Figure S1, (Supporting Information). To get further insight
into the interfacial adsorption of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys), CMC values along with other interfacial parameters
such as effectiveness (πCMC),25 maximum surface excess (Γmax),26 minimum surface area (Amin),27 standard free energy of
micellization (ΔG°mic), and
standard free energy of adsorption (ΔG°ads)29,30 at the air/solution interface
were computed from the surface tension profiles of the evaluated surfactants,
and the results are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). 2(C12Cys)
was observed to be more efficient because it attained the maximum
reduction in γ at CMC. A large value of Γmax implies the adsorption of more surfactant molecules on the solution
surface, which also means a lowering in surface tension. A low Amin value28 suggests
tight packing or complete surface coverage at the interface by the
prepared surfactants. The reduction of surface tension and Amin value of 2(C12Cys) indicate that
this compound acts as an effective corrosion inhibitor for MS in 1
M HCl solution. Negative values of ΔG°mic and ΔG°ads reflect
that both processes are spontaneous. Spontaneity in the 2(C12Cys) system is more remarkable than that in (C12Cys).
Additionally, the ΔG°ads and
ΔG°mic values are near to each
other with slightly more negativity of ΔG°ads, implying that the adsorption of 2(C12Cys) or
(C12Cys) at the interface is preferable.31

2.2 Open-Circuit Potential
(OCP)–Time Curves
Prior to commencement of an electrochemical
(PDP and EIS) experiment
a steady-state potential was established. The representative experimental
variation of the open-circuit potential (EOCP) with time, measured in 1 M HCl with different (C12Cys)
concentrations at 303 K, is presented in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It
took approximately 800 s to reach a stable OCP value.

2.3 Potentiodynamic Polarization Measurements
(PDP)
Representative PDP (anodic and cathodic polarization)
curves of MS in 1 M HCl solutions without and with different concentrations
of 2(C12Cys) are presented in Figure 1, and the corresponding polarization parameters
obtained by the extrapolation of the linear segments of the anodic
and cathodic curves are listed in Table 1. The polarization curves show that the presence
of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) decreased both the
anodic and cathodic current densities, decreasing the corrosion current
density (Icorr).

The decrease in Icorr is more evident
with increasing (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) concentration
compared to the uninhibited solution. In the present article, the
shift in the values of Ecorr of the inhibited
systems in relation to the uninhibited solution is <85 mV. The
values of Ecorr tend to change toward
the positive direction, implying the presence of (C12Cys)
or 2(C12Cys) inhibited oxidation of Fe and decreased hydrogen
evolution, implying that both studied compounds act as mix-type corrosion
inhibitors with a predominating anodic character. Table 1 shows that the values of Icorr of the acid solutions containing (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) are significantly smaller compared
to that of the uninhibited acid solution, implying that the acid corrosion
of MS is effectively hindered by both inhibitors. The values of Icorr of the lowest studied concentration of
(C12Cys) (1 × 10–3 mM) and 2(C12Cys) (5 × 10–5 mM) are 0.48 ×
10–4 and 0.67 × 10–4 A cm–2, respectively, corresponding to inhibition efficiency
(ηPDP, %) values of 65.3 and 51.9%. There is a progressive
lowering in the Icorr values with increasing
(C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) concentration.

When the concentration was increased from 1 × 10–3 to 0.2 mM (C12Cys) and 5 × 10–5 to 2 × 10–3 mM 2(C12Cys), the Icorr values changed to 0.17 × 10–4 and 0.31 × 10–4 A cm–2,
and the inhibition efficiency increased to 86.5 and 75.8%, respectively.
This suggests that in the presence of the inhibitors (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys), a protective layer is formed on the
MS surface, which acts as a barrier between MS and the HCl solution;
this resulted in the retardation of electrochemical reactions at the
electrode surface.

The variation of the Tafel slopes with inhibitor
concentration
does not follow a definite trend, indicating that the studied surfactants
insignificantly affected either the anodic iron dissolution or cathodic
hydrogen evolution, and rather, inhibition occurred by a blocking
mechanism on the available metal spaces.32 The ηPDP (%) of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) obtained from corrosion current densities shows that
efficiency is proportional to inhibitor concentration. However, 2(C12Cys) showed quite high inhibition efficiency at minimal concentration
in comparison to (C12Cys).

Simplest fitting
is represented by the Randles equivalent circuit
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). This circuit is a parallel combination of Rct (charge transfer resistance) and Cdl (double layer capacitance), both in series
with Rs (the solution resistance). It
is evident from Figure 2a that all of the obtained impedance spectra exhibited a single capacitive
loop, which suggests that the corrosion of MS in both uninhibited
and inhibited 1 M HCl is usually associated with double layer behavior33 and mostly controlled by a charge transfer process
under the open-circuit conditions. Moreover, for all of the evaluated
concentrations, the impedance spectra have identical shape, implying
that addition of 2(C12Cys) or (C12Cys) into
the corrosive solution does not cause a change in the corrosion mechanism.
The occurrence of depressed semicircles is proposed to be due to the
frequency dispersion of interfacial impedance.34 This capacitance dispersion at the metal surfaces is mainly
due to surface roughness, the chemical heterogeneity of the surface,
and the adsorption–desorption process of inhibitor molecules
on the MS surface.35

To overcome
this situation, a constant phase element (CPE) that
corresponds to surface roughness, impurities, degree of polycrystallinity,
chemical inhomogeneities, and adsorption of inhibitive molecules36 is introduced in the equivalent circuit in place
of Cdl. CPE, the impedance function, is
given as follows.36 1  where Y0 is the
CPE constant, j is the imaginary unit, ω is the angular frequency,
and n is the CPE exponent (represents the deviation
from the ideal performance and it ranges between 0 and 1). The lower
value of n (Table 2) for MS in the studied corrosive solution indicates
surface irregularity resulting from MS surface roughening due to corrosion.

However, in (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) inhibited
solutions, n values were observed to increase, indicating
a reduction in inhomogeneity of the surface due to the adsorption
of inhibitor molecules.37Y0 is converted into Cdl by
the use of the following equation.34 2  where ωmax = 2πfmax (fmax denotes
maximum frequency at which the imaginary component of the impedance
has a maximum). The experimental and computer fit results of the Nyquist
plots and Bode plots (impedance and θ) for MS in 1 M HCl and
1 M HCl containing 2 × 10–3 mM of 2(C12Cys) are shown in Figure 3a,b. It can be seen that the fit results are agreeable with
the experimental data within 10% error. The inset figure (Figure 3a) depicts the magnified
form of the Nyquist plots for the blank.

Figure 3 Experimental and computer
fit results: (a) Nyquist plots; (b) Bode
plots.

From the impedance data given
in Table 2, it is clear
that the values of Rct for the (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) inhibited solutions rises with
the concentration of the inhibitors.
This is related to the formation of a protective layer at the MS–acid
interface. The Cdl values are observed
to decrease with an increase in concentration of (C12Cys)
or 2(C12Cys). The lowering in Cdl value for the inhibited solutions is attributed to the increase
in the electrical double layer thickness and/or a drop in the local
dielectric constant.37 Further, the decrease
in the Cdl values verifies the adsorption
of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) molecules on the MS
surface by replacing water molecules, leading to a reduction in the
number of active sites available for the corrosion reaction. Also,
the increase of Rct values with increasing
surfactant concentration indicates that the charge transfer process
is mainly controlling the corrosion process. In contrast, the better
protection given by an inhibitor can be associated with a decrease
in the capacitance of the metal. Typically, at 1 × 10–3 mM of each inhibitor, the presence of (C12Cys) gives
an Rct value of 266.8 (Ω cm2) and Cdl value of 1.62 ×
10–4 (μF cm–2), whereas
2(C12Cys) gives respective values of 373.5 (Ω cm2) and 0.70 × 10–4 (μF cm–2), respectively. This implies the improved inhibition
by 2(C12Cys) over that of (C12Cys). The values
of inhibition efficiency (ηEIS) were calculated from Rct in the absence and presence of the inhibitors.
In both cases, ηEIS increases with the inhibitor
concentrations, and follows the order: ηEIS 2(C12Cys) > ηEIS (C12Cys), in accordance
with the results from the potentiodynamic polarization measurements.

Bode plots for MS immersed in 1 M HCl containing various concentrations
of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) inhibitor exhibit one
time constant. This show that the (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) systems form a monolayer and the charge transfer reaction controls
the dissolution process occurring at the MS/solution interface.38 As we can see in Figure 2b, raising the concentration of surfactant
(C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) in the HCl solution results
in a phase angle closer to 90°, suggesting excellent inhibitive
behavior due to adsorption of more (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) molecules on the MS surface at higher concentrations.
Further, the shift of phase angle for the inhibited systems suggests
a change in the electrode interfacial structure upon addition of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys). The regular increase in the
phase angle shift in the inhibited solution is obviously associated
with the growth of the inhibitor film and increased surface coverage
on the MS surface, resulting in a higher inhibition efficiency. Considering
the frequency versus impedance plots (see Figure 2b), the impedance values for the 2(C12Cys) or (C12Cys) inhibited systems is higher than
that in their absence. Further, the value of impedance increased with
increasing surfactant concentration, suggesting the corrosion rate
of MS in HCl solution is decreased by the addition of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys), and continues to decrease on increasing
the concentration of the surfactants.

2.5 Gravimetric
Measurement
2.5.1 Influence of Concentration
and Immersion
Time on Corrosion Inhibition
The inhibition efficiency (ηw) values calculated from weight loss measurements for MS in
1 M HCl solution having various concentrations of (C12Cys)
or 2(C12Cys) inhibitors at the four temperatures 303, 313,
323, and 333 K are given in Table 3. It is apparent from the table that the studied inhibitors
reduced the corrosion of MS in acid medium markedly. ηw increased with an enhancement in the concentration of the studied
inhibitors and reached a maximum at 0.2 and 2 × 10–3 mM of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys), respectively.
The increase in ηw with increasing inhibitor concentration
is suggestive of the enhancement in the degree of adsorption of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) on the MS surface.

The ηw (%) of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) was found to
be 86.5 and 73.4%, respectively, at 0.2
and 2 × 10–3 mM at 303 K. The ηw (%) of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) over the range
of concentrations studied is higher than that reported for some monomeric
and Gemini surfactants in the literature39−48 (see Table 4). Compared
to previously studied monomeric and Gemini surfactants based corrosion
inhibitors, the present compound yields a much higher inhibition efficiency
at very low concentration. The demand for both better and more environmentally
friendly surfactants has led to the formulation of these surfactants
that have high performance and lower toxicity. This aspect adds to
the practicality of using the present inhibitors under investigation.
Furthermore, the cost effectiveness can be explained based on the
fact that these inhibitors are used in really low concentrations.

To judge the
durability of inhibitive performance of the tested
inhibitor on a time scale, weight loss measurements were conducted
in 1 M HCl solution in the presence of an optimum concentration of
each inhibitor for 3–96 h immersion time at a temperature of
303 K. The variation of ηw (%) with various immersion
times (t) is shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). ηw (%) increased from 71.04 to 93.39%
for (C12Cys) and 65.58 to 80.21% for 2(C12Cys)
when immersion time increased from 3 to 48 h. This displays the potent
adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the MS surface, resulting in
the formation of a more protective film at the MS/HCl solution interface.
Thereafter, no significant change in ηw (%) was noted;
93.39–93.02% for (C12Cys) and 80.21–79.2%
for 2(C12Cys). This is due to the negligible desorption
of inhibitor molecules with increasing immersion time. It is evident
that the studied inhibitors showed good inhibition of corrosion and
stability over a long period of immersion of MS in acid solution.

2.5.2 Influence of Temperature and Activation
Parameters
A comparison of the ηw of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) for MS corrosion in HCl solution
(Table 3) in the absence
and presence of various concentrations of inhibitor at four temperatures
(303, 313, 323, and 333 K) indicated that ηw enhanced
with an increase in inhibitor concentrations, with an increase in
temperature up to 333 K. The increase in ηw with
a rise in temperature is indicative of chemisorption.38 The temperature dependence of the corrosion rate can be
expressed by the Arrhenius equation,49 where
the natural log of ν is a linear function with 1/T, where ν is the corrosion rate, Ea is the energy of activation, R is the universal
gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. 3  On the basis of the gravimetric measurements, Figure S5a (Supporting Information) graphically represents the regression of log (ν) with
an increase in 1/T for MS in the absence and presence
of different concentrations of the synthesized (C12Cys)
and 2(C12Cys) inhibitors, respectively. The straight lines
indicate the linear relationship between log (ν) and
1/T.

The Ea values
at different temperatures were calculated from the slope, equal to
−Ea/R of each
straight line, and are listed in Table 5. Generally, in the presence of both the synthesized
inhibitors, the activation energy is lower than that in their absence,
and a more obvious lowering in Ea is accompanied
by a more efficient inhibitory effect with concentration of the synthesized
inhibitors. The decrease in Ea with inhibitor
concentration is typical of chemisorption. An alternative formulation
of the Arrhenius equation50 is shown below,
where ν is the corrosion rate, N is the Avogadro
number, h is the Planck’s constant, R is the universal gas constant, T is the
absolute temperature, ΔH* is the enthalpy of
the activation, and ΔS* is the entropy of the
activation. 4  Plotting log (ν/T) against 1/T yields straight lines, as
shown in Figure S5b (Supporting Information). Values of ΔH* and ΔS* were calculated from the slope −(ΔH*/2.303R) and intercept log (R/Nh) + (ΔS*/2.303R), respectively (Table 5). Assessment of Table 5 shows that the values of Ea, ΔH*, and ΔS* varied
in an identical manner. The positive sign of the enthalpy (ΔH*) reflected the endothermic nature of the MS dissolution
process. ΔS* in the presence of surfactants
(C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) was less than that in
the blank; this implies that disorder on the MS surface decreased.51

2.5.3 Adsorption
Isotherm and Thermodynamic Calculations
From gravimetric
data, it is possible to determine the values of
the degree of MS surface coverage, θ, as a function of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) concentration. The calculated
values of θ were fitted to several kinds of adsorption isotherms
(e.g., Temkin, Frumkin, and Langmuir isotherms), but excellent fitting
was observed for the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. In this model,
θ is related to the concentration of the inhibitor (Cinh) by the following equation. 5  where Kads stands
for the equilibrium constant in the adsorption process. A linear relationship
between Cinh/θ versus Cinh was observed with a strong correlation coefficient
(R2). In Figure 4, the values of R2 for the Langmuir adsorption model are close to 1 for both inhibitors.
Higher values of Kads (Table 6) suggest stronger adsorption
of the inhibitor molecules on the metal surface and hence better inhibition
efficiency.52

a Values are obtained from the verification
plot of ΔG°ads vs T.

With increasing temperature,
the values of Kads increased, implying
that 2(C12Cys) and (C12Cys) are easily and strongly
adsorbed onto the MS surface
at relatively higher temperatures.

The standard free energy
of adsorption, ΔG°ads, is related
to Kads by the following equation. 6  where 55.5 is the molar concentration of water
in the solution expressed in M, R is the gas constant (8.314 J K–1 mol–1), and T is the absolute temperature (K). The negative values of ΔG°ads (Table 6) confirm
the spontaneity of the adsorption process and stability of the adsorbed
surfactant layer on the MS surface. ΔG°ads values range between −26.18 and −37.60 kJ
mol–1 for both the studied inhibitors (Table 6); this specifies
that the adsorption of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys)
molecules on the MS surface involves physisorption along with chemisorption.53

As thermodynamic models are useful for
describing the mechanism
of an inhibitor’s adsorption on a metal surface, the heat of
adsorption, ΔH°ads, was deduced
using the van’t Hoff equation. 7  The plot of log Kads versus 1/T for (C12Cys)
is given in Figure S6a (Supporting Information), and the figure for 2(C12Cys) is not shown here. The absorptive heat (ΔH°ads) was approximated from the slope of this graph
and is presented in Table 6. The positive value of ΔH°ads, 12.23 kJ mol–1 for (C12Cys)
and 6.10 kJ mol–1 for 2(C12Cys), discloses
that the adsorption of 2(C12Cys) or (C12Cys)
molecules on MS is an endothermic process, which is generally attributed
to chemisorption.54 Again, another thermodynamic
parameter (ΔS°ads) was obtained
using the equation 8  The values of ΔS°ads for (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) are negative,
which might be due to the orderly adsorption of their molecules on
the MS substrate causing a considerable decrease in the values of
entropy.

The variation of ΔG°ads with
1/T yields a straight line with a slope that equals
ΔH°ads = 12.20 kJ mol–1 (Figure S6b). The ΔH°ads values found by the two methods are in good
agreement.

2.6 Surface Characterization
Figure 5A–D
depicts
the AFM images of the surface topographies for MS prior to immersion
and after immersion in 1 M HCl solution without and with the studied
inhibitors. A very rough surface topography for the uninhibited system
and a pronounced reduction in surface roughness for the inhibited
system is evident. The corresponding average surface roughness (Ra) (calculated with the associated software)
of the polished MS surface prior to immersion was observed to be 70.8
nm (Figure 5A). In
the absence of (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys), the surface
displayed an extremely rough topography (Figure 5B) due to an unhindered corrosion attack
and the Ra increased from 70.8 to 627
nm. In the presence of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys),
the MS shows a smoother surface and the Ra value decreased from 627 to 290 nm for (C12Cys) (Figure 5C) and 118.6 nm for
2(C12Cys) (Figure 5D).

Figure 5 AFM images of MS after 6 h immersion in 1 M HCl solution: (A) polished
MS prior to immersion, (B) uninhibited solution, and (C) acid solution
with 0.2 mM (C12Cys) and (D) 0.002 mM 2(C12Cys).

The SEM micrographs of the polished
MS specimen and those of MS
exposed to the uninhibited and inhibited acid solutions are shown
in Figure 6A–D.
A close look at the SEM images obtained after MS immersion in 1 M
HCl solution without (Figure 6B) and with 0.2 mM C12Cys (Figure 6C) or 0.002 mM 2C12Cys (Figure 6D) revealed a rougher
surface for the uninhibited system compared with that of the inhibited
system. This is attributed to the shielding imparted by the adsorption
of inhibitor molecules onto the MS surface. The better inhibitive
potential of 2(C12Cys) compared to that of (C12Cys) is also reflected as the surface of the MS in Figure 6D shows a closer resemblance
to the freshly polished MS surface.

1 M HCl solution: (A) polished
MS prior to immersion, (B) uninhibited solution, and (C) acid solution

Figure 7 presents
the EDAX spectra recorded for MS samples exposed for 6 h in 1 M HCl
solution in the absence and presence of optimum concentrations of
(C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys).

Figure 7 EDAX images of MS after
6 h immersion in 1 M HCl solution: (A)
polished MS prior to immersion, (B) uninhibited solution, and (C)
acid solution with 0.2 mM (C12Cys) and (D) 0.002 mM 2(C12Cys).

The EDAX spectrum of
the polished surface (Figure 7A) shows the characteristic peaks of the
elements comprising the MS. The EDAX analysis of the MS surface in
HCl solution (Figure 7B) revealed that the surface film contains mainly Fe with small percentages
of C, O, and Cl. Further, Fe peaks are considerably suppressed and
Fe content is appreciably reduced from 95% (for polished MS) to 67.56%
(for MS in HCl solution). This shows that Fe corrosion takes place
through the formation of iron oxides or iron chlorides. In the presence
of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) (Figure 7C,D), the EDAX spectra show
additional peaks of N and S, and an enhancement in the intensity of
Fe peaks to 78.3 and 82.3%, respectively.

These data show that
inhibitors having N along with S atoms have
covered the electrode surface resulting in a lowering of the extent
of acid corrosion. However, the signals appreciably strengthen upon
adding 2(C12Cys) to the HCl solutions. This is undoubtedly
due to the high contribution of the N and S in the presence of 2(C12Cys). This shows that more 2(C12Cys) is adsorbed
on the MS surface, thus confirming the results obtained from the weight
loss and electrochemical measurements.

2.7 Quantum
Chemical Calculation
Before
carrying out the theoretical calculations, ACD/Labs commercial software
was utilized to determine the major species of (C12Cys)
and 2(C12Cys) in 1 M HCl.

The calculations of the
(−NH) pKa values of the two inhibitors
(2.0 for (C12Cys) and 1.4 for 2(C12Cys)) indicate
that they are easily protonated and form cationic forms in acid media.
Therefore, their protonated forms, as depicted in Figure 8, were used for quantum chemical
calculations as well as Monte Carlo simulation to simulate their realistic
molecular structures in acid medium.

Figure 8 Protonation process of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) in acidic medium.

Figure 9 shows
the
results of the optimized structures, and highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions
for protonated (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys). As can
be seen in Figure 9, the HOMO densities for the two molecules are located on the long
carbon chain. For the LUMO electron densities, there was a clear difference.

Figure 9 Optimized
structures, and HOMO and LUMO energies of (C12Cys) and
2(C12Cys).

Although the LUMO of (C12Cys) was found on the
−SH,
−NH, and COOH groups, the LUMO of 2(C12Cys) was
concentrated on the two −NH and the disulfide −S–S–
groups. The presence of the HOMO orbitals on the long carbon chains
could make it easier for the two molecules to adsorb in a parallel
manner onto a steel surface, as shall be seen from the Monte Carlo
simulation results. HOMO and LUMO, the frontier molecular orbitals,
are widely used to anticipate the adsorption centers of inhibitor
molecules.55EHOMO indicates the propensity of a molecule to donate electrons. The
higher the EHOMO, the greater the ability
of that molecule to donate electrons. ELUMO indicates the propensity of a molecule to accept electrons. The
lower the ELUMO, the greater the ability
of that molecule to accept electrons. Energy gap, hardness, and softness
are reactivity indices that can be used to probe the ease of reactivity
and stability of a Lewis base (inhibitor) and a Lewis acid (metal)
using the hard and soft acid and base theory (HSAB).

The HSAB
description is important in understanding the predominant
factors that drive chemical properties and reactions of corrosion
inhibitors with metal surfaces. The energy gap, ΔE, indicates the reactivity propensity of a molecule toward the metal
surface. As ΔE decreases, the reactivity of
the molecule increases, leading to an enhancement in the adsorption
onto a metal surface.56

According
to the quantum chemical results obtained from Table 7, (C12Cys) has more electron donating ability than 2(C12Cys).
On the other hand, 2(C12Cys) has a higher propensity to
accept electrons from the d-orbital of Fe than (C12Cys).
This higher capacity of accepting electrons (retro-donation) from
Fe can strengthen the interaction between 2(C12Cys) and
steel when compared with (C12Cys). The energy gap, ΔE, decreases as follows: 2(C12Cys) < (C12Cys). It is clear from the above ranking that if the ordering
of ΔE is considered, 2(C12Cys) is
expected to be a more reactive and effective corrosion inhibitor than
(C12Cys). This theoretical finding is in good agreement
with the experimental results. According to Koopmen’s theorem,
the values of EHOMO and ELUMO of the inhibitor molecule are associated with the
ionization potential (I) and the electron affinity
(A), respectively. The values of I and A are defined as −EHOMO and −ELUMO, respectively,57 and the obtained values were used to calculate
the global hardness (η) and the electronegativity58 (χ). 9   10   11  The calculated values of
χ are also
mentioned in Table 7, and show the tendency of an atom to attract the shared pair of
an electron toward itself.13 Absolute hardness,
η, determines both the stability and reactivity of a molecule,
which suggests the resistivity of an inhibitor for the physical adsorption
process. Soft molecules with small energy gaps are far more reactive
than hard ones with large energy gaps, as they could readily offer
electrons to an acceptor.

The fraction of electrons
transferred (ΔN) from the inhibitor to the
MS surface can be calculated by eq 17(49) using the χ and
η values. 12  where χFe and χinh represent the electronegativity
and ηFe and ηinh represent the absolute
hardness of iron
and the inhibitor molecules, respectively. The theoretically calculated
value of χFe for iron metal is 7 eV mol–1 and ηFe is 0 eV mol–1. These
values were appropriately substituted to calculate ΔN.

The values of ΔN exhibit
the path of the
electron transfer between inhibitor and metal surface. ΔN exhibits the inhibitive performance of the inhibitors
resulting from electron donation. In the current investigation, ΔN values are >0 and <3.6, indicating electron transfer
from the inhibitors to the MS surface.59−61

2.8 Monte
Carlo Simulations
The interaction
between the two corrosion inhibitors investigated, namely, protonated
(C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys), with the Fe (110) surface
was carried out to locate the low energy adsorption configuration
and the electron transfer process that takes place at the steel/electrolyte
interface. Figure 10a shows the equilibrium adsorption configurations of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) with a stable Fe(110) crystallographic
plane.

Figure 10 (a) Model Structures simulating the adsorption of (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) on the Fe surface. (b) Probability
distribution curves in adsorption energy function for (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) on the Fe surface.

As can be seen in Figure 10a, (C12Cys) is adsorbed in a parallel orientation
to the metal surface whereas 2(C12Cys) has a twisted geometry
due to the deformation of the molecule. Furthermore, the N, S, and
O heteroatoms of 2(C12Cys) adsorbed closer to the metal
surface when compared to the heteroatoms present in (C12Cys). This indicates a stronger interaction of 2(C12Cys)
than (C12Cys). Figure 10b shows the probability distribution curves for the
adsorption energies of the two inhibitors on the Fe(110) surface.
It can be seen that 2(C12Cys) has a higher negative adsorption
energy than (C12Cys), which suggests a stronger interaction
of the inhibitor molecules with the metal surface.56,62 We conclude from the results obtained that the interaction between
2(C12Cys) and the steel surface is greater than that of
(C12Cys). This result indicates that 2(C12Cys)
is expected to inhibit steel corrosion in 1 M HCl solution more than
(C12Cys). The theoretical results are in good agreement
with the experimental results.

2.9 Mechanism
of Corrosion Inhibition
In general, the inhibition effect
of the amino acid based monomeric
and Gemini surfactants is due to the adsorption of their molecules
on the metal surface via −NH2, −COOH, and
−SH groups. The MS surface in HCl solution is positively charged,15,62 which favors the adsorption of negatively charged Cl– ions from the HCl solution at the MS/electrolyte interface thus
changing the charge on the solution side of the interface to negative
from positive. As reported in Section 2.7 (quantum chemical calculations), in 1
M HCl solution, the studied inhibitors easily get protonated and remain
predominantly in the cationic form. The negatively charged metal surface
(due to adsorption of Cl– ions) is suitable for
the adsorption of cations in acidic solution.63 Thus, the chloride ions promote the physical adsorption of the studied
inhibitor molecules on the MS surface. Additionally, the inhibitor
molecules may be chemically adsorbed on the MS surface due to formation
of coordinate type bonds between the vacant orbital of Fe atoms and
the lone pairs of electrons of the unprotonated S and N atoms. In
addition, there may be direct adsorption of the cationic species on
the cathodic sites of the MS, which may hinder the hydrogen evolution
reaction whereas the lone pair of electrons on S atoms may promote
adsorption on the anodic sites.64

3 Conclusions
1. The amino acid based monomeric and
Gemini surfactants referred to as (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) were synthesized and characterized. These compounds
exhibited surface active properties and acted as good inhibitors in
preventing corrosion of MS steel in 1 M HCl solution.

2. A potentiodynamic polarization study
showed that (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) act as mixed-type
inhibitors in acidic solution, diminishing both anodic and cathodic
corrosion.

3. The weight
loss measurement results
showed that (C12Cys) and 2(C12Cys) are effective
inhibitors for MS corrosion in 1 M HCl solutions.

4. An increase in (C12Cys)
or 2(C12Cys) concentration and electrolyte temperature
resulted in an increase in inhibition efficiency. However, in comparison
to (C12Cys), 2(C12Cys) showed high corrosion
inhibition efficiency at comparatively low concentration.

5. High inhibition efficiencies
exhibited
by the inhibitors were attributed to their adherent adsorption and
the adsorption fitted Langmuir’s kinetic/thermodynamic model.

6. The results obtained from
weight loss,
polarization, and EIS techniques are in good agreement.

7. AFM and SEM/EDAX images are suggestive
of a smoother MS surface in (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) inhibited acid solution compared to that in the uninhibited
system.

8. Experimental
findings were adequately
supported by quantum chemical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.

V-0.03357, and Fe-99.59. Prior to a weight loss or electrochemical
experiment, the MS surface was successively abraded with mechanical
grade emery papers of 320–1200 grade. Before using the specimen
in weight loss measurements or as a working electrode (WE) in electrochemical
measurements, it was well cleaned, degreased with ethanol, washed
with double-distilled water, and finally dried in warm air.

Blank (1 M HCl) solution was prepared by diluting analytical grade
HCl (37%) with double-distilled water. For corrosion measurements,
the concentration range of surfactants varied from 1 × 10–3 to 0.2 mM for (C12Cys) and 5 × 10–5 to 0.002 mM for 2(C12Cys). The test solutions
in all measurements were made using double-distilled water.

4.3 Chemical Synthesis of Inhibitors
(C12Cys)
and 2(C12Cys) used in this work were
synthesized and purified as reported25 and
the detailed procedure is given in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1).

4.4 Surface Tension Measurement
Surface
tension (γ) of 2(C12Cys) and (C12Cys)
solutions in 1 M HCl was determined as a function of their concentration
on a Kruss tensiometer K11 MK3 (Germany) using the ring tear-off method.
To equilibrate, the solutions of surfactants were placed at room temperature
for 15 min. Values of γ decrease continuously and then become
constant along a wide concentration range. When the constancy of γ
begins, the point of break was considered as the CMC of the system.

4.5 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical measurements were done in an AUTOLAB 1L corrosion
cell (three neck) with a Ag/AgCl electrode, provided with a luggin
capillary probe as reference electrode along with Pt foil as counter
electrode. A MS coupon, which acted as the working electrode (WE)
was attached to a specially designed holder. To minimize IR drop,
the tip of the luggin probe was placed very close to the surface of
the WE. The measurements were accomplished by an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat,
model 128 N, with an inbuilt impedance analyzer FRA 2 at 303 K under
unstirred conditions. Prior to the commencement of an experiment,
the potential was continuously monitored until it stabilized and a
steady-state open-circuit potential (OCP) was achieved.

For
the anodic and cathodic polarization curves, an overpotential voltage
of −250 mV versus Ag/AgCl to +250 mV versus Ag/AgCl with reference
to OCP was applied at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1.
Corrosion current density (Icorr), equilibrium
corrosion potential (Ecorr), anodic Tafel
slope (βa), and cathodic Tafel slope (βc) values were obtained using NOVA 1.11 software. Inhibition
efficiency (ηPDP) and surface coverage (θ)
at different inhibitor concentrations were calculated by the equations
given below, where Icorr and I(i)corr are the corrosion
current densities without and with inhibitor, respectively. 13   14  Impedance spectra were obtained
at OCP within
the frequency domain of 10–2–105 Hz by applying 10 mV sine wave AC voltage. Before starting experiments,
the electrochemical system was stabilized to gather EIS data at OCP.
The obtained EIS spectra were analyzed for the values of Rct, charge transfer resistance, and Cdl, double layer capacitance. Inhibition efficiency (ηEIS) was computed at each inhibitor concentration with the
help of the following equation. 15  where Rct and Rct(i) are the charge transfer resistances
without and with surfactant, respectively.

4.6 Gravimetric
Measurement
The gravimetric
measurements were done in a 250 mL glass beaker positioned in a water
bath with thermostat control. The MS specimens were weighed and suspended
in 100 mL of electrolyte with and without (C12Cys) or 2(C12Cys) for 6 h at 303, 313, 323, and 333 K. As the tests were
completed, the coupons were picked out, rinsed with double-distilled
water, the corrosion product stripped off the sample surface with
a soft nylon brush, thoroughly dried, and weighed. Measurements were
done in triplicate to ensure high accuracy and the mean values of
the corrosion rates were reported.

The corrosion rate (ν)
and ηw (%) at various concentrations of 2(C12Cys) or (C12Cys) were obtained by following the below
equation where w1 and w2 are the weight loss before and after immersion, respectively, A represents the surface area of the coupon (cm2), and T is the exposure time (h). 16   17  

4.7 Surface Characterization: SEM/EDAX and AFM
Surface
characterization studies were accomplished to find out
the extent of corrosion damage in the absence and presence of the
inhibitors in terms of surface roughness/heterogeneity, which in turn
gave an idea about the extent of protection offered by the adsorbed
surfactant layer. For SEM/EDAX and AFM analysis, the MS coupons of
size 2.5 × 2.0 × 0.1 cm3 were prepared as described
above, this was followed by their immersion in the test solution without
and with optimum concentrations of inhibitor for 6 h. After completion
of immersion, the specimens were retrieved, the corrosion products
removed mechanically, and the specimens were thoroughly rinsed with
distilled water, dried, and subjected to AFM and SEM/EDAX analysis.
The AFM analysis was done at room temperature in tapping mode in air
using an AFM-Dimension icon ScanAsyst equipped with a Nanoscope V.
The scan rate and scanning area were 0.4 Hz and 50 × 50 μm2, respectively. The SEM images were obtained with a scanning
electron microscope (model: JEOL JSM- 6510LV) with EDAX attachment
(model: INCA, Oxford).

4.8 Quantum Chemical and Monte
Carlo Simulations
Quantum chemical calculation was done using
the density functional
theory implemented in the Spartan’14 v1.1.8 software. The exchange–correlation
was treated using a hybrid, B3LYP functional. A full optimization
was performed using the 6-31G (d,p) basis sets. Molecular properties
relevant to the activity of the molecules as corrosion inhibitors
such as energy of the highest occupied orbitals (EHOMO), energy of the unoccupied molecular orbitals (ELUMO), energy gap (ΔE), electron affinity (E), ionization potential (I), hardness (η), softness (σ), and electronegativity
(χ) were obtained.

The interaction between 2(C12Cys) or (C12Cys) and the MS surface was undertaken using
Monte Carlo simulations. Adsorption Locator module in the Material
Studio Software 7.0 (BIOVIA-Accelrys) was employed for the simulations.
The simulation was done with Fe(110) crystal with a slab of 5 Å
in depth with periodic boundary conditions. This ensured the simulation
was of a representative part of an interface devoid of any arbitrary
boundary effects. An Fe(110) plane was enlarged to a (12 × 12)
super cell to provide a large surface for the interaction of 2(C12Cys)/(C12Cys). Thereafter, a vacuum slab with
50 Å thickness was built above the Fe(110) plane. The Fe(110)
surface was fixed before simulations. To optimize the structures of
all components of the system of interest during the whole simulation
procedure, a universal force field was used.
