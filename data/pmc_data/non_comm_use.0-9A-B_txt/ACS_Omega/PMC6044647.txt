Elevated histamine
(HTM) levels are closely linked to food poisoning
as well as to pathophysiological allergic diseases. In this study,
HTM-imprinted, solution-processable microspheres were prepared via
high-dilution conventional thermal polymerization (CTP) and controlled
radical polymerization (CRP) using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate
(80 or 90 wt %) and methacrylic acid at 60 °C in acetonitrile
and evaluated as recognition materials for sensing applications. The
polymers were selective to HTM in binding studies, cross-rebinding,
and competitive binding assays against the HTM analogues histidine,
imidazole, and tryptamine. The selective binding capacity was significantly
higher with CTP-80 (on the basis of mass: 21.0 μmol/g and surface
area: 8.08 × 10–2 μmol/m2)
than that with both CTP-90 (8.47 μmol/g, 4.49 × 10–2 μmol/m2) and CRP-80 (9.00 μmol/g,
1.19 × 10–2 μmol/m2).

Introduction
Molecularly imprinted
polymers (MIPs) are synthetic materials with
recognition properties that have been used in separation, catalysis,
chemical sensing, and drug-discovery applications.1,2 The
first generation of MIPs was prepared using traditional polymerization
processes, in which polymer chain propagation and termination were
hard to control. This often resulted in irregularly shaped, monolithic
polymers that required grinding and sieving before use.3 In addition, these polymers were insoluble in
most solvents and required exhaustive extraction for removal of the
template. The presence of heterogeneous pockets within the polymer
network structures also sometimes compromised the binding of the material
with the template, resulting in low-affinity or nonselective binding.
Over the years, the development of traditional radical precipitation
polymerization (TRPP) allowed the preparation of MIPs in nano/submicrosphere
formats. This process involved reaction under highly dilute conditions,
where soluble branched oligomers were continuously captured from the
solution, leading to the growth of the particles. Progressive growth
occurred until the particles were no longer soluble in the reaction
medium. Unlike that in emulsion or surfactant polymerization, no extra
stabilizer was needed.4,5

Recently, controlled radical
polymerization (CRP) techniques, namely,
atom transfer radical polymerization,6,7 reversible
addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT),8 nitroxide-mediated9 and photochemical-iniferter-induced10 polymerization, have been found to allow the
generation of reactive chains that can undergo reversible propagation/termination
cycles. The process involves a reversible chain transfer agent (CTA;
typically a dithioester for RAFT), where there is a dynamic equilibrium
between the active propagating radical species and the inactive thiocarbonylthio-terminated
species. When
a RAFT agent is introduced during precipitation polymerization, the
RAFT mechanism can be imparted to the reaction. The controlled
nature of RAFT polymerization is attractive for the preparation of
MIPs, providing polymers with increased structural homogeneity and
improved properties in comparison with those of the MIPs prepared
via TRPP.11−13 In addition, functional polymer microspheres with
tailor-made recognition sites and functional dithioester surface end
groups can be produced. These dithioester groups facilitate further
reaction or surface modification by reinitiation via RAFT polymerization.14,15 Recent reports have shown that favorable properties are attributed
to the use of RAFT agents in precipitation polymerization. MIPs prepared
via CRPs exhibited improved binding, such as faster binding kinetics,15 higher binding capacities,12,14,16−19 and larger binding association
constants, Ka and Nmax, when calculated using the conventional method of binding
per mass of the particle.12

Submicron-sized
polymeric particles (i.e., microgels, nanogels,
microspheres, or simple nanoparticles) are popular formats of choice
in molecular imprinting. MIP nanoparticles exhibited better binding
kinetics due to the presence of more accessible imprinted sites.20−22 Further, they can be dispersed in solution, which allows easy characterization
using standard procedures for highly soluble macromolecules (processable).
MIP nanoparticles have been prepared by a number of methods, including
solution polymerization, precipitation polymerization, and mini- and
micro-emulsion polymerization. Solution radical polymerization was
successfully demonstrated by Wulff’s group in the preparation
of solution-processable sugar-imprinted microgels,20 with a crosslinking degree of 50–90 wt %. The same
technique was also used in the preparation of soluble imprinted nano/microgels
with catalytic properties.21,22 Haupt’s group23 utilized high-dilution surfactant-free precipitation
polymerization to prepare water-soluble microgels, which act as enzyme
inhibitors. Vaihinger et al.24 produced
enantioselective imprinted nanospheres via miniemulsion polymerization.

The work presented here involves the preparation and binding evaluation
of solution-processable histamine (HTM)-imprinted microspheres (MIM)
by high-dilution radical polymerization using an azo initiator (2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)
(AIBN)) via conventional thermal polymerization (CTP) and CRP using
methyl-2-(butylthiocarbono-thioylthio)propanoate (MCEBTTC) as the
CTA. To date, this CTA has not been applied to any RAFT-mediated precipitation
polymerization for MIP preparation. In addition, since this study,
only Trikka et al. have reported on the use of polymer precipitates
as a HTM-recognition material.25 Hence,
the motivations
of this study were as follows: to increase our understanding on the
use of CTA in RAFT polymerization, to prepare processable MIPs that
can be used as recognition elements for optical-based HTM sensing,
and to analyze the binding data expressed with respect to mass versus
surface area. Our investigation focused on the influence of the initiation/polymerization
method on the binding performance of these HTM-imprinted microspheres.

HTM (1), the template of choice for this study, is
one of the biogenic amines associated with food spoilage26,27 and pathophysiological conditions related to allergy.28−30 HTM is found naturally in foods, such as vegetables, fruits, fish,
and cheese, in small quantities. Elevated levels of HTM occur as foods
spoil, which when ingested can result in food poisoning. Hence, HTM
levels are used to monitor and assess the safety and quality of food
products to ensure that the concentration does not go beyond its safe
threshold (i.e., 50 ppm, 5 mg/100 g).31 HTM is also found in human tissues at relatively low concentrations
(0.1–20 μg/g). It is stored primarily in mast cells in
tissues and basophils in blood, where it is tightly bound with heparin
in membrane-bound granules. Upon exposure of cells to an antigen or
a wide range of drugs, HTM can be released.30 Thus, there is a need to develop assays to measure HTM levels in
food, urine, and tissues.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
HTM (1), l-histidine (HTD, 2), imidazole (IDZ, 3),
and tryptamine (TTM, 4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. Methacrylic acid (MAA, 5) and ethylene
glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 6) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and purified by passing through basic alumina (Al2O3) columns. AIBN was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and recrystallized in ethanol twice before use. Carbon disulfide and
1-butanethiol (both from Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. MCEBTTC
(7) was synthesized according to the procedure outlined
below. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade solvents,
such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (MeCN)
(Honeywell Burdick & Jackson), and methanol (Fisher Scientific),
were used without further purification. Na2HPO4 (BDH Chemicals), NaH2PO4·2H2O (AJAX Chemicals), KH2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich),
and H3PO4 (85%) (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received
(Figure 1).

Synthesis of RAFT Agent MCEBTTC, 7
MCEBTTC
was synthesized according to the procedure in the literature.32 Briefly, carbon disulfide (6.18 mL, 0.103 mol)
dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (50 mL) was added to a stirred
solution of 1-butanethiol (10 mL, 0.093 mol) and triethylamine (14.3
mL, 0.103 mol) in DCM (100 mL) at 0 °C under N2 over
30 min. This reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h, followed by the
addition of 1-methylbromopropionate (11.5 mL, 0.103 mol) in DCM (50
mL), and this mixture was stirred for 2 h. After the reaction, DCM
was removed and the residue was dissolved in diethyl ether. This solution
was then washed with cold 10% HCl solution (3 × 50 mL) and MilliQ
water (3 × 50 mL) and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The ether was removed under vacuum and the residual yellow oil
was purified by column chromatography (9:1 petroleum ether/ethyl acetate
on silica). Subsequently, a yellow RAFT agent was obtained. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ = 0.92 (t, J =

Synthesis of Microspheres:
Determination of Critical Monomer
Concentration for Precipitation (cmcp) and Solution Processability
Microspheres were prepared using an MAA/EGDMA (functional monomer/crosslinker)
ratio of 30:70, 20:80, or 10:90 wt %. The monomer concentration was
varied from 1 to 10 wt % of the total solution and diluted with an
appropriate solvent. The initiator, AIBN (3 wt % with respect to the
monomer concentration), was added to the reaction mixture and subsequently
purged with N2 for 5 min. Thermal polymerization was carried
out with stirring at 300 rpm at 60 °C for 24 h. After polymerization,
the microspheres were isolated by solvent evaporation, for those prepared
in MeCN, or dialysis in water, for those prepared in DMSO. Once dried,
the microspheres were washed with diethyl ether (20 mL) at least three
times to remove the unreacted monomers. Using the above procedure,
different formulations for microsphere preparation were derived (Table 1).

c Yield was based on the approximate
amount of solid residue collected after drying over the initial weight
of the monomer feed used during thermal polymerization at 60 °C.

Processability tests on the
microspheres were conducted using the
following solvents of different polarities: water, methanol (MeOH),
DMSO, DMF, MeCN, THF, chloroform (CHCl3), DCM, and diethyl
ether. Approximately 1 mg of microsphere was added with incremental
amounts of solvent until 5 mL.

Synthesis of HTM-Imprinted
Microspheres
MIMs were
synthesized in the presence of HTM. In the case of CTP, polymerization
was carried out upon the addition of 3 wt % AIBN to a monomer feed
concentration of ∼4 wt %, containing EGDMA (80 or 90 wt %)
and a 1:4 mole ratio of HTM/MAA (20 or 10 wt %) in MeCN. The monomers
were allowed to react at 60 °C for 24 h. A non-imprinted, that
is, no template added, equivalent (NIM) was also prepared vis-à-vis
each MIM formulation.

CRP MIMs were prepared using the same
formulation and polymerization conditions as those above except with
the addition of 3 mol % with respect to the total monomer concentration
(23 mg in 480 mg of feed) of RAFT agent 7 and 20 mol
% (3 mg) AIBN with respect to the amount of RAFT agent.

The
template (HTM) was removed by stirring the polymers in 10%
acetic acid in MeOH (∼30 mL) for at least 60 min. Subsequently,
the microspheres were washed with MeOH (5 × 30 mL) with stirring
(∼5 min) and subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 4000
rpm. Finally, the microspheres were washed in diethyl ether prior
to drying in a vacuum oven at 40 °C.

Template Rebinding Studies
Sorption of HTM onto the
polymer was determined by suspending an appropriate amount of microspheres
in a known concentration of HTM aqueous solution for the desired time
and measuring the difference in the concentrations of HTM before and
after sorption. Typically, a rebinding assay is carried out using
2 mg of microspheres suspended in a 0.10–2.0 mM HTM (1 mL)
solution, buffered using 25 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 at pH 7 (the buffer was prepared by dissolving
239.2 mg of NaH2PO4·2H2O and
137.3 mg of Na2HPO4 in 100.0 mL of reverse-osmosis
water, 15.33 and 9.67 mM, respectively). After centrifugation and
filtration of the microspheres, the supernatant was analyzed on a
Shimadzu HPLC (LC-20AD) fitted with an EconosphereTM C18 5 μm
column (Grace), and the mobile phase was composed of 20% MeCN and
80% buffer solution (25 mM KH2PO4 with 10 mM
triethylamine, adjusted to pH 3.0 using 85% H3PO4). The volume of sample injected was 10 μL, with a run time
of 5.0 min. The flow rate was set to 0.7 mL/min, using a detection
wavelength of 215 nm. The retention time of HTM was around 3.0 min.
The calibration curve for HTM was generated using the concentration
range of 0.200–5.00 mM. Data were processed using LC software.

Figure 5A,B (or Figure S7A,B in the Supporting Information) was
plotted by taking the values obtained from the equilibrium concentrations
of bound (B), Cb, and free (F), Cf, HTM in the heterogeneous solution. The data
were expressed in μmol/g, on the basis of the mass of the polymer,
or in μmol/m2, with respect to the surface area.
The log form (eq 2) was
utilized for deriving the two fitting parameters, a (capacity) and m (heterogeneity index), where these
two factors together with eqs 3 and 4 were subsequently used for the
affinity distribution plots (Figure 5C,D or Figure S7C,D). The
number of binding sites, N, in Table 3 was obtained using eq 3. K is the inverse of the
concentration of the free template (Cf; Fmin or Fmax) in the suspending solution (eq 4). The AD expression can be plotted for any range of
binding affinities within the concentration range of the experimental
binding isotherm. 1   2   3   4  

Selectivity and Competitive Binding Studies
Selectivity
rebinding tests were carried out on 2 mg of microspheres with structural
analogues HTD (2), IDZ (3), and TTM (4) using 1 mL of 1 mM aqueous solution of each analyte, buffered
at pH 7, similar to the procedure above for the HTM-binding assay.
Competitive binding was performed by suspending 2 mg of microspheres
in 1 mL of aqueous solution (buffered at pH 7) containing 1 mM of
each of the three competitors and HTM.

Morphology Studies
The morphology of the microspheres
was determined using a Sigma Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope
(Zeiss FESEM and Bruker EDS). The samples were prepared by drying
the microspheres in vacuum at 40 °C for 2–3 h; they were
then transferred to the surface of the sample holder. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analyses were subsequently conducted, with the chamber
pressure set at 1.01 × 10–5 Torr. The samples
were directly analyzed on a carbon background and scanned using a
1.50 kV electron beam with a secondary electron detector. The images
were viewed at 15 000× and 33 000× magnifications.
The particle size, that is, the diameter, was estimated using ImageJ
software by randomly selecting and averaging the sizes of at least
100 particles.

Particle-Size Determination
Particle
sizing was performed
at 20 °C using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZS equipped with a He–Ne laser system tuned at 632.8 nm.
The runs were carried out with a detection angle of 175° (backscatter).
The measurement setting was adjusted using polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate
as the reference material, with a refractive index of 1.51. DMSO was
used as a dispersant.

The microspheres (∼0.200 mg) were
dispersed in 1 mL of DMSO and sonicated for 20 min. An aliquot of
100 μL (dispersed microspheres) was diluted with 1.5 mL of DMSO.
Measurements of the filtered dispersions were taken at 4.65 mm and
an attenuation value between 6 and 10. The hydrodynamic particle size
was expressed as peak mean (Dh); the particle
size distribution was indicated as the polydispersity index (PDI)
and determined using Cumulants analysis with the Zetasizer v6.12 software.

Surface Area and Porosity
Gas adsorption analysis was
carried out using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area
and Porosity instrument (Norcross, GA). The samples (100 mg) were
degassed at 110 °C under vacuum for at least 12 h, after which
adsorption isotherms were obtained using nitrogen as the adsorbate
at a temperature of 500 °C, covering a partial pressure (P/P0) range from 1 × 10–6 to 1.0. The specific surface area and pore size distribution
of each sample were determined from the adsorption data using the
linearized Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett,
Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) models, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Determination
of cmcp and Processability Tests
The
microspheres used for this study were prepared via high-dilution conventional
radical polymerization, employing MAA as the monomer and EGDMA as
the crosslinker. MAA and EGDMA were included in the formulation because
the microspheres will subsequently be utilized for the preparation
of HTM-imprinted MIMs. MAA with EGDMA as the crosslinker has been
shown to be an effective functional monomer for HTM-imprinted polymers
in previous studies.25,33

Initially, MeCN and DMSO
were chosen as polymerization solvents on the basis of the solubilities
of the components of the reaction (MAA and EGDMA) as well as of HTM.
Stock EGDMA/MAA monomer feed mixtures containing 90 (N90), 80 (N80),
and 70 (N70) wt % EGDMA were diluted with a fixed amount (5.0 mL)
of solvent (MeCN or DMSO) to obtain various monomer feed concentrations
between 1 and 10 wt %.

In the case of DMSO, reaction mixtures
of various monomer feed
concentrations (1–10 wt %) and compositions (N90, N80, and
N70) were polymerized at 60 °C for 24 h to determine the critical
oligomer degree of polymerization for precipitation (as per IUPAC
nomenclature),34 herein referred to as
the cmcp, that is, the highest monomer concentration that does not
result in precipitation or gel formation during polymerization.20 The apparent cmcp was observed to decrease with
increasing EGDMA content and found to be 2 wt % for N90 and 4 wt %
for both N80 and N70, with yields >80%. After isolation and drying,
the processability of the polymers was tested in a number of organic
solvents of varying polarities, including water, MeOH, DMSO, DMF,
MeCN, THF, CHCl3, DCM, and diethyl ether. As the CTP polymers
were prepared
under dilute precipitation polymerization conditions, particle growth
takes place, as low-molecular-weight oligomers are continuously captured,
leading to the formation of bigger and more rigid microgels. When
these microgels are big enough, their solubilities in the reaction
medium can vary from insoluble precipitates to colloidal suspensions.
Polymer precipitates are usually difficult to disperse in a given
solvent (nonprocessable). However, the polymers prepared in this study
can be dispersed in common organic solvents. Hence, we define processability
as the ability of a polymer to form stable dispersions in a given
solvent. All polymers obtained above the apparent cmcp (i.e., ≥2
wt % for N90 and ≥4 wt % for N80 and N70) were not processable
in the test solvents, even at a high dilution, that is, a 0.15% w/v
polymer suspension (27 times lower than the estimated cmcp), and even
after being subjected to continuous shaking and heating at 60 °C
for 1 h. This observation suggests that the polymers obtained above
the apparent cmcp may no longer be microspheres/microgels. Stöver
and co-workers35,36 have also observed microgel to
macrogel transition at high volume fractions of good solvents (i.e.,
>85 vol % MEK) in a similar crosslinked polymeric system. This
transition
is favorable in a good solvent (DMSO in this case), as it allows the
nanoparticles to swell such that each microgel particle is close to
the others, enhancing the interaction between microgels.35 Upon removal of the solvent, the interconnected
microspheres become more compact and are strongly aggregated such
that it is difficult to redissolve the material. Alternatively, the
material can assume the space-filling gel (macrogel) form. Dissolution
of this macrogel is impossible, as the microgel–microgel interaction
is very strong and can neither be compensated for by the energy of
solvation upon addition of solvent nor be compensated for by the application
of external energy, for example, heating or sonication.

In the
case of the microspheres prepared in MeCN, gelation was
not observed even at a monomer feed concentration of 10 wt % after
24 h of polymerization (see Figure S1).
However, all reaction mixtures turned milky, with no significant change
in the solution viscosity. This indicates that stable colloidal particles
were formed from high-dilution precipitation polymerization,23 which is quite different from the TRPP, in which
there is phase separation. In the absence of an apparent cmcp, processability
tests were conducted using solvents of varying polarities to retroestimate
the cmcp (Table 1).
N90 microspheres prepared from a 5 wt % monomer feed concentration
were not processable in all test solvents; the particles aggregated
such that they would settle at the bottom of the solution (data not
shown). However, microspheres that were processable in DMSO, DMF,
THF, or MeCN were obtained when the feed concentration was lowered
to 4 wt % (N90-4) in ≥6 h. On the other hand, the N90-4 microspheres
obtained after 3 h were processable in all solvents tested but provided
a yield of only 40%. Thus, subsequent microsphere syntheses were performed
for 24 h (see Figure S2 for TEM images
after polymerization) to optimize the yields (≥90%). Microspheres prepared
at lower crosslinker contents, N70 and N80, using 4 and 5 wt % monomer
feeds, respectively, were also found to be solution-processable. The
processability of the microspheres increased with decreasing crosslinker
content (i.e., N70 > N80) and decreasing feed concentration (i.e.,
4 wt % > 5 wt %).

Synthesis of MIM
Template–Monomer
Interactions
The interaction
between the template, HTM, and the functional monomer, MAA, is evident
in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of HTM, MAA, and
a 1:1 mole ratio of the HTM–MAA mixture in MeCN (see Figure S3). Whereas the MAA spectrum showed a
strong peak at 1690 cm–1 due to C=O stretching,
the intensity of this peak markedly reduced upon addition of HTM,
accompanied by the appearance of peaks at 1531 and 1400 cm–1, consistent with the asymmetric and symmetrical stretching frequencies
of the carboxylate anion, which is indicative of an acid–base
interaction between MAA and HTM, that is, deprotonation of MAA with
concomitant proton transfer to HTM.37 This
has also been previously observed between ephedrine and acrylic acid.38

MIPs by CTP
HTM-imprinted microspheres
were first prepared
by CTP with the use of AIBN under the optimum conditions presented
in the previous section, that is, ≤4% (w/w) monomer feed concentration,
80% crosslinker, and a HTM/MAA mole ratio of 1:4 in MeCN at 60 °C
for 24 h. Previous reports on HTM-imprinted polymer systems have utilized
HTM/MAA ratios of 1:2 (bulk polymer for HTM detection in the nM to
μM range),33 1:5 (bulk polymer selective
to HTM against putrescine but not to spermine and spermidine),25 and 1:10 (bulk polymer for HTM detection in
the mM range).39 However, our results showed
that the amount of HTM employed in the preparation of MIMs greatly
influenced their cmcp and processabilities. An HTM/MAA ratio of 1:2
resulted in excessive precipitation (and premature cmcp) during the
early stage of polymerization (<1 h); this was not observed in
the corresponding non-imprinted microspheres. The template molecules,
HTM in this case, effectively increase the crosslinking percentage
by binding to multiple monomers. Therefore, the addition of template
results in a polymer that acts like it has a higher percentage of
crosslinker, enhancing particle growth where bigger microspheres are
obtained. Ye has also reported on the significant effect of template
on the size of the imprinted particle.40,41 Early precipitation
was circumvented by increasing the HTM/MAA ratio to 1:10. This polymer
retained a processability comparable to that of NIM; however, both
MIM and NIM exhibited similar HTM-binding performances. This is due
to the fact that the polymerization carried out under high dilution
does not favor the formation of the monomer–template complex
required in the imprinting process. Hence, at a 1:4 mole ratio of
HTM/MAA, at which precipitation was minimal, the imprinting effect
was evident, MIMs were obtained in high yields (>90%), and the
polymers
were solution-processable, was chosen for this work.

Previous
studies have shown that for MIPs to be highly selective, the formulation
should contain at least 70 wt % crosslinker.20 Nevertheless, we found that using a 70% EGDMA (with 30% MAA) formulation
(M70) also resulted in early precipitation when a 1:4 HTM/MAA formulation
was used. Conversely, no precipitation occurred, and the solution
turned milky only after 3 h, with the same formulation in the absence
of HTM (N70). In addition, no early precipitation was observed on
using 80% (M80) and 90% crosslinker (M90) reaction mixtures after
1 h of polymerization. In these systems, the MAA feed was lower (20
and 10 wt %, respectively) than that in M70 (30 wt % MAA) and the
amount of HTM added was also less, in keeping with the 1:4 HTM/MAA
ratio. Thus, to minimize changes in the particle size and processability
of MIMs, further MIM synthesis by CTP was only conducted using the
M80 and M90 formulations.

FTIR (Figure 2A;
unextracted MIM) confirmed the presence of HTM within the MIM after
polymerization. The peak at ∼1550 cm–1 is
indicative of the imidazole ring stretching and asymmetric bending
of the amino group of HTM,42,43 whereas the peak around
900–800 cm–1 is attributed to the HTM imidazole
ring in-plane bending. These peaks were not visible in the non-imprinted
microspheres (Figure 2). In addition, these peaks disappeared after exhaustive extraction
of HTM and reappeared upon HTM rebinding, indicating successful creation
of HTM-specific recognition cavities within the MIM. Incorporation
of the template onto the polymer, that is, creation of imprints, has
been demonstrated to occur during the early stage of polymerization,41 such that controlling the particle growth of
the MIM up to its cmcp is not expected to affect the imprinting efficiency.

extraction, (B) after template extraction, and (C) after HTM rebinding
and of (D) a non-imprinted microsphere. The peak between 900 and 800
cm–1 could be attributed to the HTM imidazole ring
in-plane bending. The peak at ∼1550 cm–1 is
most likely due to a combination of imidazole ring stretching and
asymmetric bending of the amino group of HTM and less likely due to
the formation of carboxylate (from MAA), as the C=O peak did
not undergo any significant intensity change, as that expected upon
deprotonation of −COOH, before and after HTM binding.

MIPs by CRP
In
addition to that by CTP, MIMs were also
prepared by CRP using the RAFT technique. Utilization of CRP in the
preparation of highly crosslinked polymers has been reported to provide
improved polymer binding performance compared to prepared using the
TRPP method.11,12 Another advantage of CRP MIMs
is the ability of the reactive chains to be reversibly cleaved, allowing
further polymerization, which, in our case, is essential for future
grafting of MIMs onto polymerizable substrates (e.g., vinyl-silylated
substrates) for subsequent sensor fabrication. The mechanism of initiation
via RAFT CRP has been thoroughly discussed in the literature.12,18,44 In this study, a minimal amount
of conventional azo initiator (AIBN) was added to the reaction mixture
to form initiating radicals that can react with the RAFT agent. The
RAFT agent, MCEBTTC, employed in the synthesis is an efficient and
commonly used RAFT initiator for styrenic,32,45 acrylic,46 and acrylamide47 systems, but to the best of our knowledge, this
is its first use in MIM/MIP synthesis and with methacrylic monomers.

Preliminary binding studies conducted on the M80 and M90 CTP MIMs
showed the M80 formulation to exhibit a better binding behavior than
that of M90. Thus, CRP MIMs were only synthesized using the M80 formulation
at a 4% (w/w) monomer feed concentration in MeCN, at 60 °C for
24 h, keeping the HTM/MAA mole ratio of 1:4. As with CTP MIMs, premature
phase separation of MIMs due to the presence of template was minimal
with this formulation, and highly solution processable MIMs were obtained
in high yields (>90%).

Physical Properties of CTP and CRP MIMs
SEM micrographs
of microspheres
prepared using CTP and CRP are shown in Figure 3, together with their particle sizes, estimated
from SEM (DSEM, collapsed dry state),
and PDIs, estimated from DLS (Dh(DMSO), swollen state in DMSO), and surface areas obtained from BET. The
CTP polymers exist as a network of aggregated particles (Figure 3A,B). The TEM images
of the microspheres (CTP-M90 and CTP-N90) obtained after the polymerization
step in Figure S2 also showed similar results.
Conversely, the SEM images show that the CRP microspheres are clustered
(Figure 3C). The Dh(DMSO) and DSEM of most microspheres are comparable, with the exception of those
of CTP-M80, CTP-M90, and CTP-N90. The observed differences in the Dh(DMSO) (bigger) and DSEM of these polymers could be attributed to particle aggregation
in solution, which, particularly for CTP-M80, was observed to be enhanced
in MeCN (Dh(ACN) = 609 nm).

and CTP-N80 (15 000×); and (C) CRP-M80 and CRP-N80. DSEM is the particle size estimated from SEM, Dh is the particle size obtained from DLS, and
PDI is from DLS.

The presence of the template
clearly affected the size of the resulting
particles, as demonstrated by CTP-M90/N90 (Figure 3A) and CTP-M80/N80 (Figure 3B). In both cases, the MIMs are ∼2–3
times larger than the NIMs (from Dh and DSEM), consistent with an earlier observation
(during synthesis) of enhanced particle growth, leading to bigger
particles for polymerizations conducted in the presence of HTM. In
fact, this effect seems to be more pronounced in CTP-M90, for which
a small number of bigger particles (843 nm) are evident from its SEM
image. These bigger particles were most likely filtered out from the
dispersion and hence not detected in DLS. The formation of a small
number of bigger particles in CTP-M90, evident from its SEM image,
is clearly due to the template increasing the crosslinking percentage
by binding to multiple monomers (as discussed earlier) and is exacerbated
by the high crosslinker content. This triggers enhanced particle growth,
resulting in particles that are bigger than expected. In general,
there seems to be no marked difference in particle size between CTP-M90
and -M80 and CTP-N90 and -N80. The PDIs from DLS measurements also
show the CTP MIMs to be more polydispersed than the corresponding
NIMs, which indicates that the presence of the template may have provided
variable rates of particle growth (between monomer clusters interacting
with HTM and monomer clusters not interacting with HTM), resulting
in a broader particle-size distribution.

Unlike that in CTP
microspheres, the presence of the template does
not affect the particle growth of CRP microspheres, as both CRP-M80
and CRP-N80 exhibit comparable Dh and DSEM. This is not surprising, as it is well known
that chain propagation, and hence polymer growth, is slow and controlled
in CRP. It is notable that CRP-M80 is less polydispersed compared
to CTP-M90, CTP-M80, and its CRP-N80 counterpart. This is different
from the result obtained using CTP polymers, where the imprinted polymers
are more polydispersed.

As expected, the BET surface areas of
the CTP polymers are inversely
related to their sizes, such that the surface areas of CTP-M90 (48
m2/g) and CTP-M80 (31 m2/g) are much lower (2
and 4 times, respectively) than those of their corresponding NIMs
(CTP-N90 = 92 m2/g and CTP-N80 = 137 m2/g).
Both CTP-N90 (pore volume = 17 cm3/g) and CTP-N80 (pore
volume = 27 cm3/g) are 4 and 3 times, respectively, more
porous than their corresponding MIMs (pore volume = 4 and 9 cm3/g, respectively); this may be due to the presence of bigger
pores, that is, >3 nm (Figure S4). These
results suggest that polymerization under NIP conditions gives a higher
surface area and pore volume. This is in contrast to that in polymers
prepared in the presence of template, in which the presence of HTM
significantly altered the polymerization process. Conversely, higher
surface areas and larger pore volumes were observed from CRP-M80 compared
to those from CRP-N80, where CRP MIM and NIM surface areas (138 and
123 m2/g, respectively) and pore volumes (40 and 25 cm3/g, respectively) were obtained. This observation is indicative
that the nature of the polymerization process, particularly the CRP
technique, could circumvent the template effect.

Binding Studies
HTM-binding tests were conducted in
aqueous solutions using 2 mg of CTP-M80/N80 polymers at varying times
from 15 to 240 min. Binding saturation for both MIM and NIM was achieved
after 120 min (Figure S5), where the incubation
was performed using a horizontal shaker. The slow binding kinetics
could be attributed to the high degree of crosslinking and low swelling
degree (<27% for both polymers suspended in 1 mM HTM in 25 mM phosphate
buffer at pH 7, data not shown), which hindered the accessibility
of the binding sites.48,49 Nevertheless, the MIM was found
to exhibit a higher binding capacity than that of the NIM, indicating
that the imprinting process successfully created HTM-selective binding
sites within the MIM.

Optimization of HTM Binding Conditions: Effect
of Buffer Concentration
and pH
The effect of buffer ionic strength on HTM sorption
was determined by varying the concentration of the phosphate (Na2HPO4–NaH2PO4) buffer
solution from 2 to 100 mM at pH 7. At this pH, HTM exists in protonated
forms HTM++ and HTM+ (Figure S6), which can readily interact (by electrostatic interaction)
with the deprotonated MAA units (pKa =
6–7) randomly distributed along the polymeric network, thereby
enhancing HTM sorption.50 HTM sorption
was observed to decrease with increasing buffer concentration up to
25 mM, at which there is minimal change for both MIM and NIM at pH
7 (Figure 4A). Our
findings corroborate those of Trikka et al.,25 who also observed that increasing the ionic strength (using NaCl)
decreased the amount of HTM sorbed onto MAA-based bulk MIPs. In the
presence of the buffer solution, the electrostatic interactions between
the microspheres and HTM could be reduced due to competing interactions
with the counterions from the buffer salt. In particular, Na+ ions could mask the negative charge density of microspheres. As
the buffer concentration increases, more Na+ ions are also
available to screen the surface charge of the microspheres, thereby
diminishing the effect of nonspecific electrostatic interactions between
the microspheres and HTM. In fact, the difference in HTM binding between
the microspheres and NIM, that is, selective binding attributed to
the creation of imprints over the buffer concentration range tested,
had not changed significantly, indicating that buffer concentration
only affects nonspecific superficial HTM sorption.

Figure 4 HTM binding on CTP-M80/N80
microspheres at (A) pH 7, with different
phosphate buffer concentrations between 2 and 100 mM, and (B) at different
pH’s, with a fixed phosphate buffer concentration of 25 mM.

Employing the optimized phosphate
buffer concentration of 25 mM,
HTM rebinding tests were also conducted at pH’s 5 and 9, at
which MAA and HTM exist in different ionic forms (Figure S6). At pH 5, HTM is mostly double-protonated (HTM++) and MAA is partially protonated.50,51 Such conditions do not promote the interaction between HTM and MAA.
Thus, as shown in Figure 4B, the MIM exhibited a low affinity toward HTM. At pH 9, HTM+ would have been predominant and MAA, fully deprotonated;
HTM binding on the MIM improved as the interaction between the template
and functional monomer was more favorable. At pH 7, however, optimum
MIM binding (234 μmol/g) was observed. At this pH, HTM would
have been completely protonated (mostly as HTM++ and some
HTM+), whereas MAA in the microspheres were predominantly
deprotonated, creating the most favorable condition for HTM sorption.
Whereas MIM binding was significantly affected by pH, NIMs behaved
similarly, giving comparable HTM bindings across the pH range tested.
The difference in binding behavior between the MIM and NIM and the
loss of binding selectivity within the MIM as a function of pH indicated
that binding in MIM was more selective and primarily governed by favorable
interactions between HTM and functional monomer MAA.

Binding Characteristics
Batch binding studies were
carried out to evaluate the binding performances of the different
MIM and NIM samples at pH 7. The binding data were expressed in two
manners: with respect to the mass of the MIP (Figure 5) and with respect to the surface area (Figure S7). All of the MIMs were shown to exhibit higher binding
than their corresponding controls (Figures 5A and S7A). Because
the binding characteristics of CTP and CRP microspheres toward HTM
were studied at concentrations well below saturation binding (0.20–1.0
mM), as such, these binding isotherms have been fitted to, and found
to conform with, the Freundlich model, with all log plots (Figures 5B and S7B) obtaining regression correlation coefficients
≥0.91.52 These linear log forms
yield two fitting parameters, a (y intercept) and m (slope) (Table 2), which can be used to generate the corresponding
affinity distribution over the concentration range studied (i.e., Kmin = 1/Fmax and Kmax = 1/Fmin) that
relates the number of binding sites, N, for each
region of binding sites having an association constant K via the equation N(K) = 2.303am(1 – m2)K–m. The affinity distribution
is presented in two formats: N versus log K (Figures 5C and S7C) and log N versus log K (Figures 5D and S7D). The N versus log K format gives the
number of binding sites within the range of association constants,
that is, the area under the distribution, whereas the linear log N versus log K format measures the
heterogeneity (i.e., the ratio of the number of high-affinity to low-affinity
sites) of the binding sites by virtue of slope m,
such that the flatter the slope, that is, lower the m, the higher the concentration of high-affinity sites.53,54

in the log N vs log K format, using calculations based on mass. N and K were obtained from the slope (m) and y intercept a of (B) (see Table 2). HTM-binding results were
obtained between the 0.10 and 1.0 mM HTM concentration range (aqueous
solution, 25 mM buffer, pH 7) using 2 mg of MIMs and NIMs. Affinity
distributions have been generated using the equation N(K) = 2.303am(1 – m2)K–m over concentration ranges Kmin = 1/Fmax and Kmax = 1/Fmin.

a From eq 2; see Figure 5 plots.

From Figure 5C,
the binding capacities, N (over the concentration
range studied presaturation), for the CTP MIMs are shown to be higher
than those for their corresponding NIMs, indicative of the imprinting
effect. Whereas CTP-M90 has a lower number of binding sites, its m is flatter (0.62) than that of CTP-M80 (m = 0.76), suggesting a higher ratio of high-affinity to low-affinity
binding sites. We can deduce that a higher crosslinker content (in
CTP-M90) can enhance the formation of higher-affinity binding sites,
consistent with the observations of other groups. The amounts of MAA
and HTM template added to CTP-M90 were also less than those added
to CTP-M80; hence, it is not surprising that the N value for CTP-M80 is greater than that for CTP-M90. In addition,
the bigger particles (see Figure 3) from CTP-M90, presumed to result from “template-enhanced
particle growth”, were separated from the batch used in the
binding studies. Conversely, CTP-N90 (m = 0.70) has
a lower number of binding sites and a higher ratio of high-affinity
to low-affinity binding sites than those in CTP-N80 (m = 0.76). In the case of CRP microspheres, even though both imprinted
CRP-M80 and non-imprinted CRP-N80 exhibited comparable heterogeneities
(i.e., m CRP-M80 = 0.68, m CRP-N80
= 0.67) (Figure 5D),
an imprinting effect was still evident. Typically, prepared MIPs have
lower m values (more heterogenous) due to the presence
of template in the polymerization step. However, this effect was not
observed in CRP microspheres. A closer look at the affinity distribution
plots reveals CRP-80 to possess a higher population of higher-affinity
imprinted sites than that in CTP-80 (m CTP-M80 and m CTP-N80 = 0.76). However, CTP-M80 exhibits a higher binding
capacity than that of CRP-M80, whereas CTP-N80 has a much lower binding
capacity than that of CRP-N80.

The data for the calculations
based on mass (Figure 5, Table 2) appeared
to be comparable to that obtained from the
surface area (Figure S7, Table 2). As the MIMs (80 and 90) prepared
using CTP have a smaller surface area compared to that of the NIM
counterpart, it is not surprising that higher binding capacity values
are obtained for MIM than those for NIM. The ratio of the binding
capacity between
the MIM and the corresponding NIM with respect to the surface area
can be exaggerated compared to that from calculations based on mass,
that is, the ratio of M80 and N80 by CTP calculated on the basis of
the surface area provided 93, whereas the calculation based on mass
gave 3.8 (Table 2).
For CRP, as there is a small difference between the binding capacities
and surface areas of the particles, the calculated binding capacities
between the MIMs and the corresponding NIMs are also comparable for
both calculations.

A quantitative comparison of
the binding performances of the microspheres on the basis of N, with K = 25 mM–1 (i.e.,
log K = 1.4), the highest affinity sites across
the concentration range studied, is given in Table 3. Among the MIMs, CTP-M80, which contains twice the amount
of functional monomers and HTM, recorded the highest binding (calculations
by mass, 28.2 μmol/g; calculations by surface area, 8.11 ×
10–2 μmol/m2), almost twice that
for CTP-M90 (15.1 μmol/g, 5.01 × 10–2 μmol/m2). CRP-M80 provided 27.2 μmol/g and
2.99 × 10–2 μmol/m2, whereas
CRP-N80 gave 18.2 μmol/g and 1.80 × 10–2 μmol/m2, with a binding capacity more than 2 times
higher compared to that of both CTP-N80 (7.18 μmol/g; 0.03 ×
10–2 μmol/m2) and CTP-N90 (6.63
μmol/g; 0.52 × 10–2 μmol/m2). Thus, the difference in binding capacities (ΔN) between MIM and NIM, imparted by the imprinting process,
is significantly higher in CTP-80 (21.0 μmol/g; 8.08 ×
10–2 μmol/m2) than that in both
CTP-90 (8.47 μmol/g; 4.49 × 10–2 μmol/m2) and CRP-80 (9.00 μmol/g; 1.19 × 10–2 μmol/m2). These results suggest that CRP can provide
polymers with better structural homogeneity;11 however, the selectivity is lower compared to that of CTP-80.

MIP particles
synthesized via precipitation polymerization are
usually porous.25 It is also well documented
that these pores carry the recognition sites in each particle. Thus,
the template–MIP binding calculations based on per gram polymer
considered the template bound to the template-specific cavities, template-nonspecific
cavities, as well as the surface of the particles. Conversely, the
calculations based on surface area precluded the presence of porous
recognition sites in the particles.

On the basis of the results
in Figure 3, the alternative
calculations generated
considering the surface area should not affect the calculated results
for CRP-80 as much as those for CTP-80 and -90. CRP polymers were
prepared using slow and controlled polymer growth; hence, the size
and surface area of the MIMs and NIMs synthesized are comparable.
However, for polymers prepared using CTP, the sizes of the CTP MIMs
are larger than those of the NIMs, whereas the surface areas of the
CTP-NIMs are larger those of the MIMs. If the polymers were prepared
in the presence of template molecules, the template could effectively
affect the rate of polymer particle growth (vide supra) and alter
the surface area of the particle.

Selectivity Studies
The selectivity of the MIMs was
investigated via noncompetitive and competitive binding assays, with
equimolar amounts of HTD (2), IDZ (3), and
TTM (4) (Figure 1) using CTP-80, the best performing MIP, and CRP-80. The results
after a 2 h incubation time are shown in Figure 6. It is obvious that CRP-80 and CTP-80 are
selective toward HTM for both noncompetitive cross-binding and under
competitive conditions.

Figure 6 (A) Noncompetitive (cross-binding) and (B) competitive
binding
assays with HTD, IDZ, and TTM in HTM-imprinted CTP-80 and CRP-80,
calculated based on mass. (C) Noncompetitive (cross-binding) and (D)
competitive binding assays with HTD, IDZ, and TTM in HTM-imprinted
CTP-80 and CRP-80, calculated based on surface area. Batch rebinding
tests employed 1 mM aqueous analyte solution at pH = 7 for 2 h.

Although HTM and HTD are of similar
sizes, both noncompetitive
cross-binding and competitive binding tests with CTP-80 yielded negative
binding for HTD. With the presence of an additional COOH group in
HTD, the molecule exists as a stable zwitterion at pH 7. Hence, under
this condition, HTD would not favor binding or interaction with the
microspheres. This result is similar to that obtained by Ye, where
negative template binding was observed for polymers suspended in phosphate
buffered at pH 6 and positive binding, for phosphate buffered at pH
7.25

The smaller IDZ molecule exhibited
noncompetitive cross-binding
toward CTP-M80. This result is also mirrored in the competitive binding
study for both CTP-M80 and CRP-M80, in which the binding capacity
of IDZ increased, while maintaining low NIM binding. We surmised that
the ability of IDZ to bind more to CTP-M80 in the presence of other
analytes is enhanced by its small size (0.42 nm in length), allowing
it to fit into the smaller pore cavities, which are not occupied by
the bigger analytes. As the pKa of IDZH+ (i.e., N-3 is protonated) is 6.99, both neutral and protonated
forms of IDZ exist at pH 7, these species are capable of interacting
with the MAA (pKa = 6–7)-based
cavities. However, the observed binding capacity of HTM was reduced
in the presence of competitors HTD, IDZ, and TTM (Figure 6B).

In both noncompetitive
cross-binding and competitive binding tests,
TTM exhibited the highest binding to polymers prepared by CTP and
CRP surpassing HTM. TTM recorded a CTP-M80 binding of 295 μmol/g,
slightly higher than that of HTM (234 μmol/g). This binding
preference is markedly pronounced in competitive tests, in which TTM
(314 μmol/g, CTP-M80; 259 μmol/g, CTP-N80) recorded a
selective binding (i.e., M80–N80) higher than (5 and 7 times,
respectively) that of HTM (61.5 μmol/g, CTP-M80; 37.6 μmol/g,
CTP-N80). For CRP MIMs and -NIMs, TTM exhibited the highest binding
for both cross-binding and competitive tests at >300 μmol/g
for MIM and NIM. However, selectivity was observed for HTM, where
195 μmol/g for CRP-M80 and 141 μmol/g for CRP-N80 were
bound. Under competitive conditions, less HTM was bound, at 60.4 and
36.3 μmol/g for CRP-M80 and CRP-N80, respectively. At pH 7,
the amino groups of both HTM and TTM are protonated (pKa’s = 10) and hence interactions (electrostatic)
with the functional monomer (MMA) moieties within the binding cavities
are expected to be comparable. CTP-M80 also has a higher volume of
pores between 0.7 and 3 nm, which can easily fit either a HTM or a
TTM molecule. In addition, TTM molecules can interact with each other
via π–π stacking of the phenyl rings, thereby potentially
increasing the number of TTM molecules along the binding sites and
enhancing their binding capability. Although high TTM binding was
observed for CTP and CRP polymers, these interactions are not specific.

Perhaps the most significant difference with the two calculations
can be observed between the HTM and TTM bound to the MIM versus NIM
for CTP (Figure 6).
As the value of the surface areas for CRP-M80 (138 m2/g),
CRP-N80 (123 m2/g), 825 and CTP-N80 (137 m2/g)
are close to each other, their HTM and TTM binding performances are
similar. This is in contrast to that in CTP-M80 (31 m2/g),
where the results for the noncompetitive cross-binding and competitive
binding for HTM and TTM were higher compared to those for the NIM
counterpart.

Despite the competition from TTM, it is worth noting
that the potential
application targeted for these HTM-selective MIMs is for sensing the
presence of HTM in fish, as an indicator of fish spoilage, or in tissue
or urine. Among the three analytes tested, only HTD, which did not
exhibit affinity toward the HTM MIMs, is a potential competitor in
the real situation of testing for fish spoilage.

Conclusions
The solution-processable HTM-imprinted microspheres used in this
study were prepared via high-dilution CTP and CRP using the RAFT technique. The microspheres
obtained below the apparent cmcp in MeCN were found to be processable
in a number of organic test solvents of varying polarities, whereas
those prepared in DMSO were not, even at a high dilution. Processable
HTM CTP MIMs were prepared in high yields (>90%), with the optimal
4% (w/w) monomer feed concentration in MeCN containing a 1:4 HTM/MAA
ratio and 80 or 90 wt % (M80 or M90, respectively) EGDMA at 60 °C
for 24 h. CRP MIMs were synthesized using only 80 wt % (CRP-M80) EGDMA.

The presence of the template, HTM, has been observed to promote
binding to multiple monomers and to increase the effective crosslinking
percentage. This effect of the template on the physical properties
of the resulting microspheres was evident in the CTP systems and not
in the CRP systems. The CTP MIMs were bigger, with lower surface areas,
and more polydispersed than the corresponding NIMs, which indicated
the presence of template-introduced particle growth. However, CTP-NIMs
were more porous than CTP MIMs. Conversely, the presence of the template
did not seem to affect the particle growth of CRP microspheres, as
both the MIM and NIM exhibited comparable sizes, expected in RAFT
polymerization. However, contrary to the results obtained using CTP,
the CRP MIMs exhibited a higher porosity and had a larger surface
area than CRP-NIMs.

The data obtained form the binding studies
fitted to the Freundlich
model, where the binding isotherms and affinity distribution (over
the concentration range studied) showed the binding capacity, N, for the CTP MIMs to be higher than that of their corresponding
NIMs, indicative of the imprinting effect. Whereas N for CTP-M80 is twice that for CTP-M90, CTP-M90 exhibited a flatter
slope, m, demonstrating a higher ratio of high-affinity
to low-affinity binding sites. This suggested that a higher crosslinker
content enhances the formation of HTM-binding sites. In the case of
the CRP microspheres, both imprinted CRP-M80 and non-imprinted CRP-N80
exhibited comparable heterogeneities, suggesting that the binding
sites are as good as those obtained from CTP-90. Among the MIMs, CTP-M80,
which contained twice the amounts of MAA and HTM compared to those
in CTP-M90, recorded the highest N (28.2 μmol/g),
almost twice those for CTP-M90 (15.1 μmol/g) at K = 25 mM–1, the highest affinity point across the
concentration range studied. Conversely, CRP-M80 provided an N value of 27.2 μmol/g, comparable to that of CTP-M80,
whereas the value for CRP-N80 (18.2 μmol/g) was 2 times higher
than that for CTP-N80 (7.18 μmol/g) and CTP-N90 (6.63 μmol/g).
As a result, the selective binding capacity (NMIM – NNIM) imparted by
the imprinting process was significantly higher in CTP-80 than that
in both CTP-90 and CRP-80. From these results, the binding capacity
calculations for CTP based on surface area can be exaggerated, especially
if there is a small surface area, compared to the calculations based
on mass. For CRP, as there is a small difference between the calculated
binding capacities and the surface areas of the two particles, the
difference obtained between the MIMs and the corresponding NIMs is
also small.

Noncompetitive and competitive binding assays against
HTM analogues
HTD, IDZ, and TTM showed CTP MIMs and CRP MIMs to be selective to
HTM under cross-binding and competitive conditions, although a reduction
in HTM binding was observed in the latter test. TTM was also found
to preferentially bind to both CTP-M80 and CRP-M80 over HTM in both
noncompetitive cross-binding and competitive binding tests. We attributed
this to the
ability of TTM to easily compete with HTM for access to binding sites
by virtue of their similarity in size, functionality, charge, and
interaction through their phenyl rings, thereby enhancing TTM’s
access to binding sites.

This study has demonstrated successful
creation of imprints in
solution-processable MIMs, allowing an alternative synthetic pathway
toward the fabrication of MIP-based materials. Although previous studies
have shown that polymers obtained under controlled free-radical precipitation
conditions gave a better binding performance compared to that of CTP,
in this study, CRP-M80 prepared with MCEBTTC gave a lower binding
capacity but a higher ratio of high-affinity to low-affinity sites
compared to those of CTP-M80. These processable MIMs can be appropriately
functionalized (demonstrated to be possible by CRP-RAFT) to facilitate
further reactions in solution, such as attachment to supports and
immobilization on a substrate to produce membranes/thin films for
HTM recognition.
