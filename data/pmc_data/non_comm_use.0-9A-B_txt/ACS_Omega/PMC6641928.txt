Titanium oxides crystals are widely
used in a variety of fields,
but little has been reported on the functionalities of noncrystalline
intermediates formed in their structural transformation. We measured
the oxygen reduction reaction activity of titanium oxide nanoparticles
heat-treated for a different time and found that the activity abruptly
increased at a certain time of the treatment. We analyzed their structures
by using X-ray pair distribution functions with the help of high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
and ascertained that the abrupt increase in the activity corresponded
to a structural transformation from a reduced lepidocrocite-type layered
titanate to a disordered structure consisting of domains of brookite-like
TiO6 octahedral linkages. The further treatment transformed
these brookite-like domains into another phase having more edge-sharing
sites like the TiO-type cubic structure. This finding would position
noncrystalline, disordered structure as a possible origin of the catalytic
activity, though nanocrystalline rutile particles might be also considered
as the origin.

Introduction
Titanium oxides are
used in a variety of fields because of their
functionalities, abundance, and environmental friendliness; especially,
titanium dioxide crystals (rutile, anatase, brookite, etc.) are mostly
used for catalysis applications. Titanium oxides adopt diverse structures,
including the polymorphs of titanium dioxide mentioned above, and
show structural transformation upon thermal treatment or oxidation/reduction
treatment.1 The structures are, in general,
composed of TiO6 octahedra forming three/two-dimensional
networks.2 For example, brookite, anatase,
and rutile are composed of edge-sharing and corner-sharing TiO6 linkages to form three-dimensional crystal structures.

Compared with such crystalline phases, little has been reported
on noncrystalline or disordered intermediates formed during the structural
transformation, though they might have unique coordination environments.3,4 Regarding the structure formation of titanium dioxide crystals in
solvothermal reactions, the noncrystalline lepidocrocite-type layered
titanate was found to be a common intermediate.5 Titanium oxides adopt a variety of structures, and thus
such intermediates may be diverse as well and indeed important for
understanding the structural transformation.5−7 Moreover, the
functionalities of such noncrystalline phases were less investigated,
and are interesting for creating new properties.

Here, we show
that a titanium oxide nanoparticle system exhibits
an abrupt increase of the catalytic activity associated with the formation
of an intermediate, noncrystalline structure during the structural
transformation between lepidocrocite-type titanate and rutile structure.
Titanium oxide crystals (rutile TiO2, anatase TiO2, corundum Ti2O3, etc.) have been investigated
as the potential electrocatalysts for the electrochemical oxygen reduction
reactions (ORR),8−13 but it was found that a noncrystalline intermediate phase could
be active in the reactions. Thus, we have investigated the relationship
between their structures and activities systematically.

Experimental
Section
Synthetic Procedures
The catalysts were synthesized
by the thermal decomposition of oxytitanium tetrapyrazinoporphyrazine
(TiOTPPz) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes as reported previously.9,14 In brief, TiOTPPz was mixed with carbon nanotubes, (i) heated up
to 900 °C in Ar, (ii) retained at the temperature in Ar containing
2% H2 and 0.05% O2, where equilibrium O2 partial is 1.3 × 10–19 atm (retention
time = 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 h), and then (iii) cooled down to room
temperature. To investigate the contribution of the carbon materials
to the catalytic reactions, the samples without oxides were prepared
by removing the oxides with hydrofluoric acid.

The contents
of the titanium oxides were determined by calcination in dry air up
to 1000 °C; 8.0 (0 h), 9.3 (0.5 h), 9.3 (1 h), 9.6 (3 h), 10.7
(4 h), and 16.6 (10 h) wt %. We revealed that this slight increase
in the loading amount was attributable to the partial pyrolysis of
carbons through the thermogravimetric analysis (pyrolysis of TPPz
molecules at 400–500 °C; pyrolysis of carbon nanotubes
at 500–750 °C in dry air). Thus, the obvious particle
growth observed at 10 h is probably due to the pyrolysis of the outer
amorphous carbons, which results in particle growth on the external
surface of the carbon matrix.

Electrochemical Measurements
The ORR activities were
measured in an acidic electrolyte of 0.1 M H2SO4 using an electrochemical system with a rotating ring-disk electrode
setup and a three-electrode cell (reference electrode is a reversible
hydrogen electrode, RHE; counter electrode is a glassy carbon). The
working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode coated with the samples
(loading = 1.3–1.4 mg sample per cm2; 4.90 ±
0.05 mg of the powder samples was dispersed in 160 μL of 1-hexanol
with 8 μL of 5% Nafion, dropped onto the electrode, and then
dried at 30 °C overnight).9 We optimized
this process to obtain a homogeneous and flat surface under an optical
microscope. After cleaning the catalysts by scanning 200–400
cyclic voltammograms at 150 mV s–1 (0.05–1.2
V vs RHE), the voltammograms for the ORR test were obtained by scanning
from 1.2 to 0.05 V vs RHE in an O2-saturated electrolyte
at 30 °C. The ORR activities were obtained by subtracting the
double-layer charge obtained using a N2-saturated electrolyte
solution from the total current densities obtained using the O2-saturated solution.

X-ray Structure Analysis
Pair distribution
functions
(PDFs) were obtained from the X-ray total scattering data collected
using a Rigaku Rapid-S X-ray diffractometer with Ag Kα radiation
(22 keV). The averaged wavelength, λ = 0.556 Å, was calculated
using NIST CeO2 standard by PDF fitting using the PDFgui
program.15 The samples were sealed in Lindeman
glass capillaries. Twenty-four frames of the image data recorded on
a curved imaging plate (exposure time = 2 h per frame) were integrated.
After subtracting the image data collected without a sample, the intensity
of each pixel was corrected for the proportion of Debye–Scherrer
rings, thickness of the imaging plate, and polarization of X-ray;
the pixel data were then converted into total scattering pattern.
The intensities of the samples treated with HF and glass capillaries
were subtracted from the scattering data of the samples with the oxides.
These difference intensities are considered to contain the scattering
from oxide phase as well as its interaction with the carbon phase,
but the latter contribution was found to be negligible.16 Thus, the total scattering patterns were normalized
using the atomic scattering factors of TiOx composition determined by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analyses, and the total structure function thus obtained was converted
into the reduced PDFs by Fourier transformation.

The structures
were analyzed by curve fitting of the PDFs using the PDFfit2 program15 modified by adding an additional code for running
the real-space reverse Monte Carlo simulations with bond-length restraints,
bond-angle restraints, and atom swapping.17

Other Measurements
The XPS data were recorded using
the Thermo Fisher Theta Probe using monochromatized Al Kα (1.487
keV) with charge neutralization. The spectra were corrected by the
background subtraction with the Shirley method and charge-corrected
using C 1s peak (284.5 eV). The peak intensities were determined by
the least-squares curve fitting and converted into the atomic percentage
using relative sensitivities. The high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) at 200 kV.

Results
and Discussion
Electrocatalytic Activity
Figure 1a–c shows
that the samples annealed
for more than 2 h exhibit catalytic activity associated with the presence
of titanium oxides and gradually decreases with further annealing.
The titanate particles were deposited on a carbon matrix (Figures 1d and S1), which was formed by the pyrolysis of the
organic ligand of the titanium complex and deposited on carbon nanotubes
used as current collectors for the electrochemical tests. The titanate
particle size was about 2 nm up to 5 h, and bulky particles were observed
on the external surface of the carbon matrix in the sample annealed
for 10 h (Figures 1d and S1).

for a different retention time. The samples with (blue) and without
(red) titanium oxides are compared. (a) Linear sweep voltammograms
of the samples annealed for 3 h. The data were collected in 0.1 M H2SO4 (negative sweep) and then double-layer charge was corrected. The
current densities are based on the geometric areas. (b) Comparison
of kinetically controlled current densities. (c) Trend of mass activity
of the samples annealed for a different retention time. The activities
are normalized by the carbon contents. The activity was obtained at
0.80 V vs RHE. (d) High angle annular dark field scanning transmission
electron microscopy images of the sample annealed for 0, 1, 3, 5,
and 10 h (at the same magnification).

We carefully evaluated the electrocatalytic activities associated
with the oxide phases because the carbon matrix exhibited catalyst
activity, as widely known18−20 (Figure 1b), as well as conductivity supporting titanium
oxides in the electrochemical measurements. Thus, to clarify the activity
associated the titanium oxides, we prepared the samples without the
oxides by removing titanate with HF. The activities up to 1 h are
attributable to the carbon materials, whereas the difference in the
catalyst activities between the samples with and without oxides shown
in Figures 1 and S2 is attributable to the activities of the oxide
particles. Note that the influence of the HF treatment on the carbon
materials were confirmed to be negligible (Table S1, Figures S3–S5).

Elemental States
Elemental states of Ti ions are important
to understand the origin of the activity,21,22 and thus they were analyzed by core-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The Ti 2p spectra (Figures 2 and S6) show that the samples
annealed for less than 3 h contains TiIII (456.8 eV) as
well as TiIV (∼458.5 eV).23 Considering that the presence of similar amount of N state assignable
to Ti–N (∼396 eV) and that these two states synchronously
decrease with annealing time (Figure 2b), the TiIII state is attributable to the
formation of Ti–N bonds (not titanium nitride). Because this
Ti–N disappears at 3 h, the formation of Ti–N is not
the origin of the ORR activity in this catalyst system. In addition
to this oxidation, the TiIV peak shifted toward a higher
binding energy with annealing retention time (Figure 2a; 458.3 eV at 0 h, 458.5 at 1 h, 458.7 at
3 and 5 h, and 458.8 eV at 10 h), indicating the core holes in Ti
ions are less shielded in the more annealed samples. This corresponds
to an elongation of the Ti–O bonding by structural transformation
revealed by the following structure analysis. Thus, it is reasonable
to consider the structural transformation occurring between 1 and
3 h is the key to understand the abrupt increase in the activity.

photoelectron spectra: (a) Ti 2p spectra. The black dots show the
experimental data, the red curves are the simulated spectra, and other
curves are fitted peaks of the Voigt functions. The vertical dotted
line shows the position of the TiIV peak in the sample
annealed for 0 h. (b) Composition change with annealing retention
time.

Atomic Structures
We analyzed their atomic structures
by using the X-ray pair distribution functions (PDFs), which can inform
us of the structures of all of the materials, even nanocrystals and
amorphous materials, which can show broad features in the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns.16Figures 3 and S7 show that
a structural transformation occurs from 1 to 3 h. This is consistent
with the trend of the catalytic activity and the XPS results. It is
apparent that the structural transformation is the key to understand
the activity. Thus, in the following paragraphs, we discuss the structures
in detail.

Figure 3 X-ray PDF structure analysis. (a) Pair distribution functions (Qmax = 17.5 Å–1). The
experimental data (blue) were fitted with simulated curves (red) based
on structure models: (i) lepidocrocite-type TiO2 (0 h),
(ii) rutile and brookite (3 h), and (iii) rutile, brookite, and TiO-type
structure (10 h). The fitting range was 1–10 Å for 0 and
1–20 Å for others. (b) Structure models and polyhedral
connectivity. EmCn represents the polyhedral connectivity: numbers of edge sharing
(Em) and corner sharing (Cn).

The structure of the
sample annealed just by increasing the temperature
up to 900 °C (retention time = 0 h) was found to be a lepidocrocite-type
layered titanate. The formation of lepidocrocite-type titanate is
not surprising because it was also reported as an intermediate in
solvothermal reactions,5 and the structure
is apparently different from the “amorphous” titania
prepared by the hydrolysis of titanium complex.25 The stacking of the layers was disordered as indicated
by the presence of the diffuse scattering intensities located at below
9° in the XRD pattern (Figure S7a),
which was assignable to the reflections along the interlayer direction.
The PDF fitting model consisted of (i) an isolated layer for modeling
chemical short-range order (i.e., atom positions in a layer) with
two Ti atoms and four O atoms (P21/m) and (ii) three layers of the same lepidocrocite structures
with large isotropic atomic displacement parameters for modeling number
density.5,26 Considering the little freedom of the modeling
(note that the model had only one independent Ti site and O sites
and did not include N or other defects such as TiIII states),
the modest fitting quality is enough for confirming the validity of
this structure model. The modeled unit cell is a =
14.1(4) Å, b = 4.233(14) Å, c = 3.059(11) Å, and β = 88(4)°.

Upon the thermal treatment, the layered titanate
was oxidized as revealed by the XPS analysis, and the absence of diffuse
scattering associated with the stacking of the layers (<8°; Figure S7a) at 0.5 h suggests that the sintering
of the layers has commenced, but its PDF is still almost unchanged
(Figure S7b). The sample annealed for 1
h shows the XRD and PDF having the features of both samples annealed
for 0.5 and 3 h, clearly indicating the commencement of the structural
transformation, which may be triggered by the removal of nitrogen
dopants (Figure 2b).27 Through the transformation, the PDF peak reflecting
the Ti–Ti distance in edge-shared linkage (∼3 Å)
decreased, whereas the PDF peak reflecting that in corner-shared linkage
(∼3.8 Å) increased. This is reasonable because lepidocrocite
structure, wherein TiO6 octahedra form a two-dimensional
structure through edge-sharing connectivity, is rich in edge-shared
linkage of TiO6 octahedra (or denser) than the typical
TiO2 crystal structures (anatase, brookite, and rutile; Figure 3b).

To understand
the structure of the sample annealed for 3 h, we
tested a number of possible structure models of titanium oxides (e.g.,
rutile, anatase, brookite, etc.) with/without the defects analyzed
by curve fitting of the PDFs using the PDFfit2 program15 modified by adding an additional code for running
the real-space reverse Monte Carlo simulations with bond-length restraints,
bond-angle restraints, and atom swapping,17 and finally found that large rutile particles (6.0(15) nm, 46 wt
%; P42/mnm, a = 4.610(7) Å, c = 2.969(6) Å) and particles
having brookite-like octahedral linkage (diameter = 2.2(3) nm, 54
wt %; Pbca, a =
9.21(6) Å, b = 5.28(3) Å, c = 5.49(3) Å) were formed. The formation of these structures
from lepidocrocite-type titanate is reasonable in the light of the
similar connectivity.5,28 The formation of rutile crystals
can be confirmed by XRD (Figure S7a) as
well as TEM (Figure 4a), but brookite “crystals” were not found by the XRD
and the TEM. Looking closely at the partial PDFs (Figure S8), the PDF fitted with brookite structure model indicates
that the structure has (i) a short-range order within ca. 2 nm and
(ii) more edge-shared TiO6 octahedra than rutile (but less
than lepidocrocite) (cf. Figure 3b).

Figure 4 Bright-field HR-TEM images of titanium oxide particles
in the sample
annealed for 3 h. (a) A crystalline particle observed on the edge
of the carbon matrix. The inset is a fast Fourier transform (FFT)
image, which is assignable to the observation of rutile particle along
[010]. (b) A modestly ordered particle (not assignable to rutile).

High-resolution transmission microscopy
(HR-TEM) images enable
us to distinguish if the domains are brookite nanocrystals or particles
having short-range orders of such a linkage. The oxide particles on
the edge of the carbon matrix are several nanometer scale and mostly
show well-crystalline atomic-resolution images (Figure 4a), which are assignable to rutile TiO2. We found that well-crystalline large rutile particles were
also formed on the external surface of the carbon matrix in the sample
annealed for 10 h. The other particles apart from the carbon edge
appear to be not crystalline (Figure 4b), though the particle size is similar to the size
of the rutile particles. We can observe local orders in these particles
(Figure 4b), but an
FFT analysis of these particles did not show clear spots, that is,
no long-range orders existing in these particles. Thus, the ca. 2
nm scale domain found by PDF indicates averaged short-range orders
in these particles. This lack of crystallinity of the brookite-like
structure might be reasonable because brookite needs longer range
orders to crystallize, that is, typical unit cell volumes of brookite
(ca. 257 Å3), rutile (ca. 62 Å3),
and anatase (ca. 136 Å3). Alternatively, it might
be due to the nanosize/morphology effect.29

Further annealing grew the particles located on the external
surface
of the carbon matrix (by TEM), which are well-crystalline rutile (47
wt % at 5 h and 46.7 wt % at 10 h) as described above. Note that the
X-ray crystallite sizes for these samples (4.7(7) nm at 5 h and 3.8(3)
nm at 10 h) seem inaccurate due to the narrower PDF fitting range
(up to 2 nm), correlation of parameters in the three phases, and beam
profile of the X-ray scattering measurements. Alternatively, as observed
in the HR-TEM images (Figure S9), these
results may reflect the formation of shear planes (or ordered defect
sites) in the rutile structure. The content of rutile phase is constant
from 3 to 10 h, though the size observed by the TEM increased, indicating
the segregation and growth of rutile particles. That is, the smaller
particles deposited in the carbon matrix were not transformed into
rutile yet. This can be accounted for by the size effect (namely,
because rutile has a large surface energy, extremely small rutile
particles are not stable).27

PDF
analysis (Figure S6) revealed that
the content of the brookite-like domains decreased from 3 to 10 h
(2.8(5) nm, 38.8 wt % at 5 h; 2.8(6) nm, 29.1 wt % at 10 h), whereas
another phase assignable to a TiO-like cubic structure (modeled with
the space group of Fm3̅m,
Ti occupancy = 0.5) was grown from 5 h (2.4(10) nm, 14.1 wt % at 5
h; 4.4(11) nm, 24.2 wt % at 10 h). This phase has the closest packing
of oxygen ions and isotropic structure, and thus is reasonable to
be formed by relaxing the oxygen packing of lepidocrocite-type structure.
The averaged polyhedral connectivity of this phase is E6C3 as shown in Figure 3b (half of E12C6 in TiO because
of the occupancy of Ti sites). The PDF of this additional phase is
similar to that of the lepidocrocite-type structure (Figure S8) but slightly richer in the edge-sharing linkages
of TiO6 (Figure 3b) and longer Ti–O distance (Figure S8). Considering the absence of this phase at 3 h as well as
their sizes and contents, this additional phase should be formed from
the brookite-like phase, as clearly illustrated in Figure 5, and inactive in the oxygen
reduction reactions.

Figure 5 Summary of phase information. The numbers on the bars are the domain sizes determined
by the PDF analysis, except the rutile particle sizes in the samples
annealed for 5 and 10 h, which were observed by TEM observation. Details
are discussed in the main text.

Conclusions
The formation of a noncrystalline structure
consisting of brookite-like
TiO6 octahedral linkages should be the origin of the catalytic
activity in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reactions. Our investigations
clearly show that the presence of a TiIII state and a Ti–N
do not account for the catalyst activity, though they may contribute
to the formation of the brookite-like domains by stabilizing the lepidocrocite-type
structure at the initial stage of the annealing process. We believe
that such an octahedral network existing in the brookite-like domains
contains active sites for the oxygen reduction reactions; however,
honestly, the tiny rutile crystals (2–4 nm, found by TEM; Figure 4a) formed at 3 h
may be another possible active structure in the oxygen reduction reactions
and their particle growth resulted in a decrease in the activity.
Currently, further investigations are being carried out to conclude
this finding, which indicates the abrupt increase in the catalyst
activity is probably attributable to the formation of such a noncrystalline
phase in the structural transformation.
