Highly selective removal of N2 from unconventional natural
gas is considered as a viable way to increase the heat value of CH4 and reduce the greenhouse effect caused by the direct emission
of CH4/N2 mixture. In this work, a three-dimensional
Cu–MOF with two different types of micropores was synthesized,
exhibiting a high selectivity for CH4/N2 (10.00–12.67)
and the highest sorbent selection parameter value (65.73) among the
reported materials. The CH4 molecule interacts with the
framework to form multiple van der Waals interactions both in hydrophilic
and hydrophobic pores, indicated by density functional theory calculations
to gain a deep insight into the adsorption binding sites. In contrast,
the weak polarity feature of the hydrophobic pore and the occupied
open-metal sites in the hydrophilic pore result in a very low adsorption
uptake of N2. The excellent separation performance combining
the good stability and regenerability guarantees this Cu–MOF
to be a promising adsorbent for an efficient separation of the CH4/N2 mixture.

==== Body
Introduction
Nowadays, the continuous
consumption of fossil fuels has raised
many issues-related to energy and environment, creating an increasing
demand for the development of clean energy. Natural gas (the main
component is methane, CH4) is considered as an alternative
energy source due to its clean and economical features and has become
one of the fastest-growing energy source in the world.1−6 A large amount of CH4 is emitted from conventional natural
gas and unconventional natural gas (such as landfill gas, shale gas,
and coal bed methane). The latter resource with a substantial amount
of CH4 is very difficult to utilize directly because the
high concentration of nitrogen (N2) lowers the heat enthalpy.
Current treatment, like direct emission, will lead to a serious greenhouse
effect.2 Therefore, it is of significance
to efficiently separate the CH4/N2 mixture,
which is however a great challenge because of the very similar physical
properties CH4 and N2.7,8 To
date, several technologies have been used, such as cryogenic distillation,9 membrane separation,10−12 and adsorption
separation,13 where pressure swing adsorption
(PSA) is regarded as an promising industrial and commercial technology,14,15 due to the advantages of low investment cost, simple operation,
flexibility, and energy conservation.16,17 The key is
suitable adsorbent. Different types of adsorbents have been investigated,
while the separation performance is still very low so far,1−9 especially for the integrated consideration of selectivity and productivity
simultaneously.

As a new kind of porous material, metal–organic
frameworks
(MOFs) have exhibited potential applications in gas separation owing
to the good designability as well as structural and chemical adjustability.15,18−21 Due to their unique structural and chemical features, several MOFs
have been studied to separate CH4/N2 with better
separation performances than other porous materials.1,7,9 However, it still needs to be
further enhanced. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) Cu–MOF
was selected to separate the CH4/N2 mixture.
The hydrophilic and hydrophobic pores endow this material with a large
difference in the interaction between CH4 and N2 with the framework. As a result, a high selectivity for CH4/N2 is obtained, especially for the sorbent selection
parameter (SSP)22 that can evaluate the
selectivity and productivity in the mostly industrialized pressure
swing adsorption (PSA) process. In addition, this MOF has good stability
and regenerability, providing a great potential to separate the CH4/N2 mixture in practical application.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization for Cu–MOF
Cu–MOF was
synthesized using copper salt and H3BTC, and the structure
is given in Figure 1.23 Copper clusters
with a paddle wheel structure are connected by monomethyl BTC ester.
The unique structure of Cu–MOF is due to the esterification
of BTC linker during the synthesis process. Such a structure is different
from the well-known Cu–BTC because the paddle wheel copper
clusters are occupied by μ2-coordinated carboxylate
O atoms of the paddle wheel unit in the adjacent sheet after the material
is dehydrated, effecting that the Cu open-metal sites are not exposed.
This change in coordination environment causes the dimensionality
of the frameworks to vary from 2D to 3D with the formation of two
different types of micropores.23,24 The hydrophilic pore
is formed by the arrangement of a copper paddle wheel, and the hydrophobic
pore is formed by ester groups on organic ligands. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns in Figure 2 agree well with the simulated patterns, indicating the successful
synthesis with good crystallinity. The PXRD patterns at 2θ of
10–13° is due to the trace amount of unreacted Cu–BTC,
which has also been observed in literature.23 As indicated in literature,23 the best
yield for the esterified process reaches 100% and yields in excess
of 95% could be obtained easily. With long heating times, the amount
of Cu–BTC can be lower than 1% as an impurity. As shown in Figure S10a, the BET specific surface areas and
the pore sizes are 110 m2/g and 7 and 5 Å, respectively.

H, white).

Gas Separation Performance of Cu–MOF
Single-component
gas adsorption experiments of CH4 and N2 were
first performed at 298 K, and the results are given in Figure 3. The adsorption capacity of
CH4 is about 14.17 cm3/g at 298 K and 1.0 bar,
while that of N2 is relatively very low (2.40 cm3/g), indicating the interaction between CH4 and the framework
is stronger than that for N2. To investigate the separation
performance, ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)25,26 was used to calculated the selectivities using different fitting
models. As shown in Figures 3b and S6 in the Supporting Information
(SI), the IAST-predicted selectivities are about 10.8–11.5
(10.8 at 1.0 bar) for a dual-site Langmuir model, 10.67–12.66
(11.18 at 1.0 bar) for a single-site Langmuir–Freundlich model,
10.00–12.67 (11.14 at 1.0 bar) for the dual-site Langmuir–Freundlich
model, and 10.94 for the Toth model at the range of tested pressures.
Details can be found in the SI. These values
are higher than most of the reported values for various porous materials,
except for Co–MOF.1 While the adsorption
capacity of CH4 in Co–MOF is about 9 cm3/g, it is only 64% of that in Cu–MOF in this work. In addition,
the ratio of working capacity is valuable for estimating the separation
performance of adsorbent in practical conditions.27 For Cu–MOF, this value is about 5.90, much higher
than that of all the reported materials owing to the very low adsorption
capacity of N2.

capacity of CH4 after the treatment of the material using

experiment.

From the practical point of view,
the adsorbent should have good
water stability, since the humidity usually exists in many industrial
separation processes.28 In fact, it is
observed that the water in gas mixtures may lower the performance
to separate the CH4/N2 mixture.29 Therefore, stability test was performed by treating the
MOF sample using water for three days. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cu–MOF exhibits good water stability, and the adsorption
capacity of CH4 can be well-maintained as shown in Figure 3c. This may be attributed
to the different coordination environments in this Cu–MOF compared
to other typical MOFs with Cu open-metal sites, such as Cu–BTC.
These structures can be easily destroyed by water molecules. As shown
in Figure 1, the open-metal
sites on copper paddle wheels are occupied by μ2-coordinated
carboxylate O atoms of the paddle wheel unit in adjacent sheets, resulting
in the framework remaining intact in the presence of water.23,24 Furthermore, regeneration experiment of the material was carried
out at 298 K and 1.0 bar. Figure 3d shows that the adsorption capacity of CH4 remains unchanged even after 10 cycles, indicating the excellent
regenerability.

In practical separation processes, such as the
typical PSA process,
an excellent adsorbent should possess high selectivity and high adsorption
capacity simultaneously. The former can reduce the number of cycles
for the treatment of an input stream to reach a desired concentration,
and the latter may lower the overall cost. In this aspect, the SSP
parameter is a comprehensive indicator of the separation performance
that can reflect the cyclic nature of the adsorption processes.22 One bar and 0.1 bar are used for adsorption
and desorption conditions, respectively, considering the absence of
the adsorption data at high pressures in literature. From Figure 4b, it is obvious
that the SSP value of Cu–MOF is about 65.73 and much higher
than that of all the reported materials (Figure 4b), demonstrating that this Cu–MOF
is an ideal candidate for separating the CH4/N2 mixture.

Figure 4 Comparison of the separation performance of CH4/N2: (a) selectivities as a function of the adsorption capacity
of CH4 at 298 K and 1.0 bar and (b) SSP at 298 K. The data
of MIL-101-Cr were collected at 293 K.

To confirm the application of materials in practical applications,
a breakthrough experiment was performed using a mixture gas mixture
of CH4/N2 (50/50%) with a constant flow rate
of 5 mL/min at 298 K. As shown in Figure 5, N2 was first detected (about
2.5 min). The breakthrough of CH4 (about 7.5 min) is obviously
later than that of N2, demonstrating that CH4 molecules competitively adsorb in the framework over N2. The effluent purity of N2 is about 96%, indicating that
Cu–MOF could separate the CH4/N2 mixture
at ambient conditions.

Figure 5 Breakthrough experiment curves for the binary mixture
component
of CH4 and N2 (50/50, v/v) at a constant flow
rate of 5.0 mL/min under 298 K and 1.0 bar.

To study the separation mechanism of Cu–MOF, computations
were performed for CH4 and N2 in the framework.
Geometric optimization results in Figure 6a indicate that the distances between the
hydrogen atom of CH4 and the C–H of ester groups
in organic ligands in the hydrophobic pore and negative oxygen sites
in the hydrophilic pore are about 2.383–2.956 and 2.900–3.205
Å on average, respectively, which are shorter than those for
N2 (about 3.378–3.648 and 3.428–3.841 Å,
respectively), indicating the interaction between CH4 and
the framework is stronger than that for N2. The calculated
binding energies of 23.0 and 19.0 kJ/mol for CH4 in different
types of pores are higher than those for N2 (14.2 and 14.0
kJ/mol). As shown in Figure 6a, a CH4 molecule can interact with three C–H
atoms in the ester groups in the hydrophobic pore or three negative
O atoms in the hydrophilic pore to form multiple van der Waals interactions.1,30 In contrast, Cu atoms in the paddle wheels are coordinated by μ2-coordinated carboxylate O atoms, resulting in a relatively
weak interaction of the N2 molecule in the hydrophilic
pores. In the hydrophobic pore, the weak polarity group C–H
also exhibits a weak interaction with N2.31 In fact, Qst of N2 in Cu–MOF is lower than those in other porous materials.1,2,7,32 Therefore,
the adsorption capacity of N2 is very low, leading to the
higher SSP than those in the reported materials. It should be noted
that Qst of CH4 is moderate
compared to the values in other materials, which can reduce the regeneration
cost since the cost of energy in the regeneration process is a major
factor to be considered in the practical industrial application.1

Conclusions
In this work, a kind of Cu–MOF with hydrophilic
and hydrophobic
pores was synthesized, exhibiting a high selectivity and the highest
SSP value among the reported values for the CH4/N2 mixture. The DFT calculations confirm that the CH4 molecule
interacts with the framework to form relatively stronger multiple
van der Waals interactions through the H atoms of CH4 with
three C–H in the ester groups on the organic ligands in the
hydrophobic pore and three negative O atoms in the hydrophilic pore.
In contrast, the interaction with N2 molecule is weak due
to the unique coordination environment of Cu in the paddle-wheel structure.
Furthermore, this MOF has good water and thermal stabilities, as well
as regenerability. These results indicate that Cu–MOF might
be a potential candidate for the separation of CH4/N2 in practical industries.

Experimental Section
Materials
All general chemicals reagents and solvents
(AR grade) are commercially available and used directly as received
without further purification. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) were
derived from Alfa Aesar. Methanol (CH3OH) was obtained
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data
were recorded on a D8 Advance X diffractometer equipped with a Cu
sealed tube (λ = 1.54178 Å). The measurement of a single
gas sorption isotherm and the pore structure were performed by a Quantachrome
Autosorb-IQ instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried
out by GA Q50 in an air atmosphere (20 mL/min, from 30 to 800 K with
the rate of 5 K/min). The FT-IR spectroscopy data were obtained by
the Nicolet 6700 FTIR instrument. Morphology of the material was characterized
by Hitachi S-4700. For the breakthrough experiment, the concentration
of the outlet gases from the column was analyzed by a gas chromatograph
(Shimadzu, GC-2014C) at 298 K and 1.0 bar.

Synthesis of MOFs
The material was synthesized using
the method as described in the literature.23 Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.991 g, 4.1
mmol) and H3BTC (0.862 g, 4.1 mmol) were mixed with CH3OH (10 mL) and distilled water (10 mL) in a 25 mL Teflon-lined
steel autoclave. The reactor was placed in an oven and heated to 383
K for 7 days. After that, the reactor was cooled to room temperature.
The obtained blue crystals were filtered and washed several times
with CH3OH solvent.

Gas Adsorption Measurement
The adsorption isotherms
of CH4 and N2 at 273, 298, and 323 K were measured
using a Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ instrument. The sample was degassed
at 393 K for 12 h prior to measurement. For each gas adsorption measurement,
the weight of the sample is about 600 mg.

Breakthrough Measurement
Five grams of material was
packed into the column (10 × 150 mm2) with the void
space filled by silica wool and purged with helium (25 mL/min) at
393 K for 6 h. After that, heating and helium purge were stopped until
the device was cooled down to room temperature. Then, the mixture
of CH4 and N2 (CH4/N2 =
50:50%) at the total flow rate of 5 mL/min was passed through the
column. The concentration of the outlet gases from column was analyzed
by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014C).

Calculation of Adsorption
Selectivity
The selectivity
of the material was calculated by using the ideal adsorbed solution
theory (IAST) based on the isotherm data of the single-component experiment.25,26Sij represents the
ideal selectivity of the material, which can be defined as 1  where qi and qj are the
adsorbed quantity of the components i and j, respectively, and yi and yj are the
gas molar fractions of components i and j, respectively.

Working capacity22 was can be defined as 2  Sorbent selection parameter (SSP)22 can
be calculated as 3  where Si/jads and Si/jdes are the
selectivities of i and j components,
respectively, and Nads and Ndes are the adsorption capacities of i and j components, respectively. The superscripts
of “ads” and “des” represent the adsorption
and desorption process, respectively.

Isosteric Heat of Adsorption
The coverage-dependent
isosteric heat of adsorption is calculated using the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation33 4  where R is the
molar gas
constant (8.314 J/K/mol) and Pi and Ti are the
pressure and the temperature of isotherm i, respectively.

Theoretical Calculations
Binding energy of guest molecules
with MOF was calculated using the density functional theory (DFT)34 method in Dmol33 of Materials Studio. Generalized gradient approximation
with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh functional was applied
for the calculations, combining the double numerical plus d-functions
basis set. Self-consistent field (SCF) calculations were performed,
and the convergence criterion is 10–5 Ha in energy.
To accelerate the SCF convergence, thermal smearing was used with
a value of 0.005 Ha to orbital occupation.
