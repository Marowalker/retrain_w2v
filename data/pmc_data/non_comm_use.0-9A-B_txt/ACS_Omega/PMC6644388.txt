Finding
the material characteristics satisfying most of the photovoltaic
conditions is difficult. In contrast, utilization of foreign materials
that can contribute to light harvesting and charge transfers in the
devices is now desirable/thought-provoking. Herein, a binary hybrid
photoanode utilizing nano-amassed micron-sized mesoporous zinc oxide
hollow spheres (meso-ZnO HS) in conjunction with SnO2 nanoparticles
(NPs), i.e., SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (for an optimized weight ratio
(8:2)), displayed a nearly ∼4-fold increase in the efficiency
(η) compared to that of bare SnO2 nanoparticle device.
Enhanced device efficacy in the composite photoanode-based device
can be accredited to the dual function of nano-amassed meso-ZnO HS.
Nano-amassed micron-sized ZnO HS embedded in the photoanode can increase
the light-harnessing capability without sacrificing the surface area
as well as optical confinement of light by multiple reflections within
its cavity and enhanced light-scattering effects. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed an extended lifetime of electron
(τe) and a higher value of Rct2 at the working electrode/dye/redox mediator interface,
indicating a minimum photoinduced electron interception. The open-circuit
voltage decay reveals a slower recombination kinetics of photogenerated
electrons, supporting our claim that the nano-ammased meso-ZnO HS
can serve as an energy barrier to the photoinjected electrons to retard
the back-transfer to the electrolyte. Moreover, the improvement in
the fill factors of the composite-based devices is endorsed to the
facile penetration of the electrolyte through the pores of nano-amassed
meso-ZnO HS, which increases the regeneration probability of oxidized
dyes.

1 Introduction
Fossil
fuel resources with limited reserves are diminishing at
an alarming rate with the increase in global energy demand along with
the danger of the release of more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Solar energy with high abundance promises to be an alternative clean
and environmentally friendly energy resource. Over the last few decades,
solar cells have been introduced as an interesting alternative to
meet the increasing energy demand of the world.1,2 A
dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), owing to its cost-effectiveness,
simpler cell structure, and promising solar-to-electricity power conversion
efficiency (PCE, η), has emerged as a promising candidate alternative
to the traditional solid-state silicon solar cells.3 In 1991, O’Regan and Grätzel first reported
a DSSC affording a ∼7.1% PCE using a TiO2- and ruthenium-based
dye as a sensitizer; then, researchers have developed various photoanodic
architectures, dyes, and redox mediators over the years and achieved
∼13% record PCE till date.4,5 Nevertheless,
the low electron mobility through nanocrystalline TiO2 (∼0.1–1
cm2/(V s)) and the photocatalytic activity under UV radiation
restrict further efficiency improvement and long-term stability of
the devices.6 Numerous wide-band-gap semiconductors
such as ZnO,7 SnO2,8−10 WO3,11 Nb2O5,12 SrTiO3,13 etc. have been explored as the potential photoanodic
materials alternative to TiO2 in DSSCs. Among them, SnO2 and ZnO have been found to be the most appealing. SnO2, a stable, n-type semiconductor, has two distinct advantages
over TiO2 in terms of higher electron mobility14 (SnO2 ∼100–200 cm2/(V s)) and wider band gap (TiO2 ∼3.2 eV,
SnO2 ∼3.6 eV).15 The
higher electron mobility of SnO2 promotes faster transport
of photoinjected electrons to the collector electrode, i.e., fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO),16 thus reducing the recombination
probability of photoinduced electrons, whereas a higher band gap tends
to create fewer oxidative holes at the valence band, minimizing the
dye degradation rate, and improves long-term stability of DSSCs.17 Furthermore, SnO2 forms  homojunction
with the FTO substrate and thus resolves the high-contact-resistance
issue originated from the heterojunction formed between other metal
oxides (like TiO2 and ZnO) and FTO.18 Despite these advantages, solar cells using SnO2 as photoanodes suffer from low energy-conversion efficiency as compared
to that of TiO2. The inferior photovoltaic performance
of SnO2-based DSSCs can be endorsed to (i) faster electron
recombination kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface
and a lower open-circuit voltage (Voc)
owing to the intrinsically lower conduction band (CB) edge of SnO2 as compared to that of TiO2, (ii) reduced adsorption
of dyes having carboxylic acid as an anchoring group at the SnO2 surface due to the lower isoelectric point (IEP ∼4–5)
of SnO2 as compared to that of TiO2 (∼6–7).19 The lower dye adsorption in turn decreases the
optical density of the photoanodic film and its ability to absorb
light, resulting in a lower number of photoinduced electrons, which
limits the photocurrent in the devices.20 “Bare SnO2-nanoparticle (NP)-based devices made
from SnO2 nanoparticles only (size ∼20 nm) with
the mostly used Ru-based N719 dye rarely show power conversion efficiencies
more than PCE ∼2%”.21−23 A very convenient strategy
to overcome the adverse issues in the case of SnO2-based
photoanode is to make composite photoanodic architectures with other
wide-band-gap metal oxides such as TiO2,24 MgO,25 and ZnO.26−29 It has been seen that in the case of SnO2-based devices
the composite photoanode architecture has shown substantial improvement
in device performances, resulting from a reduced reverse tunneling
probability of photogenerated electrons. In composite photoanode systems,
it is believed that a proper combination of electronic structures
of constituents (e.g., the conduction band edge, CB edge) and distribution
of electron-accepting states in the conduction band is a critical
factor for good device performance.30 Zinc
oxide, a typical n-type semiconductor, has a higher band-edge position
as compared to that of SnO2 with a band gap of ∼3.37
eV and has the distribution of electron-accepting states in the conduction
bands similar to that of SnO2, i.e., the s-orbital.31,32 Moreover, zinc oxide is less acidic as compared with SnO2 (ZnO: IEP ∼9, SnO2: IEP ∼4–5)) and
can achieve diverse morphologies with high crystallinity,33−36 making it a suitable candidate for a composite mixture photoanode
for SnO2-based DSSCs. Apart from the electronic properties,
efficient light harvesting is an essential property for a well-performing
photoanode.37 Conventional photoanodes
utilizing only small-sized (approximate diameter ∼20 nm) metal
oxide nanoparticles (NPs) ensure a large interfacial surface area
for adsorption of dye but suffer from a significant optical loss owing
to high transparency of the photoanodic film, resulting in poorer
photovoltaic performance.38,39 Additionally, incorporation
of light-scattering materials can boost the power conversion efficiency
(PCE) in DSSCs by increasing the light-harnessing ability of the photoanode
films.40 According to  Mie theory,
micron- or sub-micron-sized scattering centers can effectively scatter
light and enhance the optical path length of the incident light in
the devices, thus increasing their probability to be trapped and eventually
absorbed, boosting the photogenerated current as well as the PCE.41,42 The basic platform for sensitizer adsorption is formed by blending
these materials and nanoparticles together in a mixture structure.43 Unfortunately, large-sized scattering materials
furnish very low surface area, resulting in a reduction in the dye
adsorption, thus limiting the device efficiency.44 On the contrary, hierarchical spherical structures used
as light-scattering centers can improve the light-harnessing efficiency
of the photoanodes without sacrificing the specific surface area of
the photoanodic films. A micrometer- or sub-micrometer-sized structure
formed by assembly of nanoparticles can ensure a high specific surface
area, whereas the larger-sized spherical assemblies can boost the
light-harnessing efficacy via the effective scattering from a single
moiety as well as from the blend. Optical confinement of incoming
photons inside the photoanode film upsurges the probability of light
absorption by the sensitizer, thereby increasing the number of photoinduced
electrons and thus improving the device performance.45−48 However, solid particles, although provide a good scattering capacity,
unfortunately inhibit diffusion of electrolyte. Intentionally created
sub-micron-sized voids in the photoanode have shown significant enhancement
in the device performance owing to better light scattering as well
as electrolyte diffusion to regenerate the photo-oxidized sensitizer
molecule, thus preventing recombination pathways at the interfaces.49,50 On the other hand, hollow spheres (HSs) can effectively increase
light harvesting via light trapping within the cavity and scattering
from the ensemble as well as provide accessible pores that assist
the penetration of the liquid electrolyte to regenerate the sensitizer.51−56

In this context, herein, we demonstrate the bifunctional effect
of nano-amassed micron-sized ZnO hollow spheres loading on SnO2 photovoltaic. Nano-amassed micron-sized meso-ZnO hollow spheres
provide a high surface area with better light-harvesting ability owing
to their mesoporous nature and hollow architecture. Moreover, ZnO
hollow spheres provide pathways for infiltration of liquid electrolyte
responsible for regeneration of sensitizer and simultaneously act
as a partial energy barrier owing to the high conduction band position
in reducing the reverse tunneling probability of photoinduced electrons
at the semiconductor/sensitizer/electrolyte interface. A systematic
study was performed on the effect of nano-amassed meso-ZnO hollow
spheres in improving photovoltaic performances and in optimizing the
loading of ZnO hollow spheres by varying the amount of ZnO hollow
spheres in different ratios, which advocates the function of ZnO hollow
spheres as an efficient synergy booster in photovoltaic performances
and as an efficient light-scattering material, as well as a partial
energy barrier impeding the back-recombination processes.

2 Experimental Section

All of the chemicals
were used for the experiments without further purification. SnCl2·2H2O power (Merck), terpineol (Himedia),
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)–poly(propylene glycol) (PPG)–PEG
triblock copolymer (Aldrich), SnCl4·5H2O (Aldrich), 2-methoxy ethanol (Himedia), absolute ethanol (TMEDA),
acetylacetone (Merck), 4-tert-butylpyridine (Himedia),
hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, Aldrich),
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich), di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)
(Dyesol, Australia), ethanol (EtOH), CH3CN (Merck), PEG
200 (Merck), valeronitrile (Sigma-Aldrich), tert-butanol
(Merck) were used. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (resistivity ∼13–15
Ω/sq cm, Aldrich), and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter (0.2
μm, Axiva) were purchased. High-grade Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ
cm) was used for all of the experiments.

2.2 Synthesis
of SnO2 Nanoparticles
(SnO2 NP)
SnO2 nanoparticles were prepared
by adopting a reported protocol.57 In the
synthetic procedure, first, 5 mmol of SnCl2·2H2O (AR) is dissolved in 50 mL of EtOH followed by stirring
for 30 min. In a 250 mL, round-bottom (RB), two-necked flask, 50 mL
of distilled H2O was added and kept at 100 °C with
a water-cooled condenser at one end and a dropping funnel at the other.
Then, the prepared SnCl2 solution was added slowly to the
250 mL flask containing 50 mL water through a dropping funnel under
vigorous stirring and the system was kept at 100 °C for 12 h
with continuous stirring. The resultant product was centrifuged and
washed with distilled H2O and EtOH 2–3 times and
dried at 60 °C in an oven. Finally, the powder was calcined at
500 °C for 1 h to obtain the final products for further characterizations.

2.3 Synthesis of Nano-Amassed Mesoporous Hollow
ZnO Microspheres (Meso-ZnO HS)
Mesoporous hollow ZnO microspheres
have been synthesized using a one-step reflux route following a reported
protocol.58 Typically, 2.973 g of zinc
nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in 100 mL of PEG 200 under stirring
conditions. The resulting solution was then transferred into a 250
mL RB flask and progressively heated to 160 °C. The system was
kept for 6 h under a refluxing process and then allowed to cool naturally.
The products were collected by centrifugation, washed with absolute
EtOH and distilled H2O several times, and kept at 60 °C
for drying. Finally, the brown powders were subjected to calcination
for 4 h at 500 °C in a muffle furnace to get the final products.

2.4 Preparation of SnO2 NP–ZnO
HS (SZx, x = 10, 20,
30) Composites
The SnO2 NP_ZnO HS composites were
prepared by sonochemical treatment taking the desired amount of ZnO
HS and SnO2 NP in different ratios (SnO2 NP/ZnO
HS 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3; named SZ10, SZ20, and
SZ30 hereafter). In detail, to form 1 g of SZ10, i.e., the SnO2 NP/ZnO HS (9:1) composite, 0.1 g of as-synthesized
ZnO HS was dispersed in isopropanol under ultrasonic treatment for
30 min. Then, the rest of the amount (0.9 g) of SnO2 NP
was added into the dispersed solution followed by further ultrasonication
for another 30 min. The similar procedure was followed for the rest
of the composites with appropriate amounts of SnO2 NP and
ZnO HS. The final composite products were obtained by placing the
dispersed solutions inside an oven to evaporate the solvent.

2.5 Device Fabrication
All of the photoanodes
were fabricated by making a homogeneous paste of SnO2 NP
and SnO2 NP–ZnO HS composite, viz., SZ10, SZ20, SZ30, following a procedure similar
to that in our previous report.59 First,
a solution of 0.2 M SnCl4·5H2O in 2-methoxy
ethanol was spin-coated onto precleaned FTO and calcined at 500 °C
to get a SnO2 compact layer.60 For the preparation of homogeneous pastes, 0.5 g of SnO2 NP or SnO2 NP_ZnO HS composites, viz., SZ10, SZ20, SZ30, was ground with a mixture of
acetic acid (0.05 mL), acetylacetone (0.1 mL), terpineol, and PEG–PPG–PEG
in a mortar–pestle. This homogeneous paste was applied using
the doctor blade technique, dried at 120 °C, and finally calcined
at 500 °C for 1/2 h. The pictorial representation of the step-by-step
fabrication of photoanode is depicted in Scheme 1. The thickness of the photoanode layers
was measured by a surface profilometer and found to be ∼13–15
μm (thicknesses of champion devices are provided in Table 1). After the sensitization
process with  N719 dye for 8 h, photoanodes were sandwiched with
the Pt counter electrode (CE) using a spacer between the electrodes,
and addition of I–/I3– electrolyte solution completed the device fabrication. The device
active area was set to be 0.16 cm2 for all the devices.

2.6 Characterization and Measurements
Crystallinity and phase characterization were carried out using
a
Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (30 kV and 30 mA, Cu Kα
source (α = 0.154 nm)). The UV–vis diffused reflectance
spectroscopic (DRS) analysis was carried out using JASCO model V-650.
The studies on the morphology of the photoanodic materials and elemental
analysis were carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) using a Zeiss (model: Sigma) instrument (for FESEM, ∼2–5
kV and for energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), ∼20 kV). A Horiba
LabRAM HR spectrometer was used for Raman analysis. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analysis was performed in a Beckman–Coulter SA 3100 N2 adsorption apparatus (samples were degassed at 200 °C
for 4 h). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried
out using JEOL JEM 2100 F. The thickness of the deposited films onto
FTO substrates was measured using a surface profilometer (Veeco Dektak-150).
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements
were performed in Newport Oriel IQE-200. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopic (EIS) analysis was conducted in CHI660E. A Newport ORIEL
Sol3A solar simulator and a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) was
used to evaluate photovoltaic performance.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) Analysis
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
were recorded to confirm
the phase purity and crystallinity of pristine SnO2 nanoparticle,
ZnO HS, and SnO2_ZnO HS composites, viz., SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30, as shown in Figure 1. All of the diffraction peaks
from lattice planes (110), (101), (200), (111), (211), (220), (002),
(310), (112), (301), (202), and (321) confirm the tetragonal phase
(JCPDS file card no. 41-1445) of SnO2 NP with a = b = 0.474 nm and c = 0.317 nm.
The average crystallite sizes of the nanoparticles were evaluated
using the Scherrer equation61 from the
full width at half-maxima of the (110) peak of SnO2 and
is found to be ∼11.40 nm. In the case of ZnO HS, (100), (002),
(101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (201) peaks were indexed to
the wurtzite phase (JCPDS file card no. 36-1451) of ZnO with no traceable
impurity peaks.

Figure 1 Powder XRD patterns for the SnO2 nanoparticle
film (SnO2 NP, black line), SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (9:1),
SZ10 (red line); SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (8:2), SZ20 (blue line); and SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (7:3), SZ30 (magenta line) films on glass substrates.

Notably, the recorded PXRD patterns for composites
SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30 show the diffraction
peaks
assignable to the wurtzite phase of the ZnO crystal as well as the
tetragonal phase of SnO2 and no other additional impurity
peaks were observed. It has been seen that with an increase in ZnO
content the intensity of ZnO peaks also becomes prominent. To examine
any change in the average crystallite size of the SnO2 nanoparticle
upon ZnO hollow sphere loading, the average crystallite sizes of composites
SZ10, SZ20, SZ30 were calculated
monitoring the (110) lattice plane of SnO2 NP. However,
it was observed that 10, 20, and 30% loading of ZnO HS did not alter
the crystallite size of SnO2 NP significantly (SnO2 NP ∼11.40 nm, SZ10 ∼11.40 nm, SZ20 ∼11.39 nm, SZ30 ∼11.65 nm), which
indicates that crystallinity of SnO2 NP is retained even
after loading of ZnO HS.

3.2 Raman Analysis
Raman spectroscopy
is used to investigate the vibrational characteristics of materials
and to identify the crystallization and structural defect. Figure 2 shows the typical
Raman spectra of photoanodes fabricated with SnO2 nanoparticles
and SnO2 NP_ZnO HS composites, viz., SZ10, SZ20, SZ30, at room temperature. For SnO2 nanoparticle samples, a sharp and dominant peak observed at 633
cm–1 is assigned to the A1g vibrational
mode and the peak observed at 773 cm–1 is assigned
to the B2g vibrational mode of tetragonal SnO2 lattice. A1g (633 cm–1) and B2g (771 cm–1 ) are related to the symmetric and antisymmetric
stretching modes of the Sn–O bond, respectively.62 In the case of the composite samples SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30, the Raman spectra
displayed the presence of both metal oxides, giving evidence of the
composite nature of the mixtures. In the case of composite SZ10, along with the signature peaks of the SnO2 nanoparticle,
a sharp and dominant peak was observed at 438 cm–1, assigned to the E2 (high) mode of the wurtzite hexagonal
ZnO lattice. This mode is a fingerprint of the hexagonal wurtzite
ZnO associated with oxygen displacement.63 Another suppressed peak at 582 cm–1 is ascribed
to the A1 (LO) mode, probably occurred due to oxygen vacancy.64 As can be seen from the spectra, with the increase
in ZnO content from SZ10 to SZ30 the peak intensities
of the corresponding vibrations of the ZnO lattice also increase.
It is observed that upon ZnO HS addition there was no shift in peak
positions of the tetragonal SnO2 lattice as well as no
peaks for any tertiary phases or impurity occurred, corroborating
the powder XRD data.

substrates.

3.3 Material
Morphology
The morphological
features of the as-synthesized materials and photoanodes were studied
by carrying out FESEM analysis. FESEM images of as-synthesized meso-ZnO
HS depicted in Figure 3A corroborate that ZnO hollow spheres have an average size of ∼1
μm. From the FESEM image, Figure 3B, it is clearly evident that as-synthesized hollow
spheres are composed of self-assembled small ZnO nanoparticles with
a diameter of ∼30–50 nm. The ZnO hollow spheres are
formed by polymer-assisted Ostwald ripening of single-crystalline
ZnO nanoparticles.58 The hollow nature
of the micron-sized material favors trapping of light within the cavity
as well as efficient light scattering in the photoanode while nanoparticles
provide a comparably higher surface area than solid structures for
efficient dye loading. The magnified image of ZnO hollow spheres endorses
its porous nature and uniformly distributed pores within the hollow
spheres to facilitate the penetration of electrolyte along the material
to regenerate the oxidized dye, which is a critical factor in the
performance of a photovoltaic device.51

Figure 3 (A)
FESEM image of as-synthesized ZnO hollow spheres and (B) magnified
FESEM image of ZnO hollow spheres.

The detailed top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of
fabricated
SnO2 NP and SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (8:2), SZ20, photoanode (best device performance) have been depicted in Figures S1–S3 at different magnifications.
It can be clearly seen from the cross-sectional image (Figure S2) that the overall thickness of the
fabricated film is ∼13–15 μm (as seen in profilometer
measurements), and it shows evenly distributed ZnO HS throughout the
region. From the top view of the FESEM image of the photoanode, it
is seen that ZnO HS are well distributed throughout the specified
region, and the hollow architecture of ZnO HS can be seen from the
magnified FESEM images (trace (D) Figure S3) that facilitates the penetration of electrolyte efficiently.

Figure 4 represents
the TEM images of as-synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles and
meso-ZnO hollow spheres after ultrasonication for 1.5 h in ethanol.
The average size of SnO2 nanoparticles in Figure 4A is found to be ∼10
nm. Figure 4B shows
the HRTEM image of SnO2 nanoparticles with a well-defined
lattice pattern, revealing their crystalline nature, a prerequisite
for the efficient photoinjected charge migration. The SnO2 nanoparticles exhibit lattice fringes with an interplanar distance
(d-spacing) of 0.33 nm that can be indexed as the
(110) plane, as shown in the HRTEM image. TEM images (Figures 4C and S4) of the as-synthesized meso-ZnO hollow sphere sample clearly
show the micrometer size range of the samples in accordance with FESEM
analysis. It can be seen from the TEM image that the meso-ZnO hollow
sphere is composed of interconnected smaller ZnO nanoparticles (average
size ranging from ∼30 to 50 nm) that assembled into a hollow
morphology and showed excellent porosity. As a result, light can be
trapped inside the hollow cavity (through open port in trace (C))
by multiple reflections as well as enhances the light-harnessing ability
of the photoanode. Trace (D) depicts the HRTEM image of nano building
blocks of meso-ZnO HS showing an interplanar distance of d ∼0.26 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane. The selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern for meso-ZnO HS (inset to trace
(D)) infers the single-crystalline nature of the wurtzite ZnO crystalline
structure. The single-crystalline nano building blocks in the meso-ZnO
HS microstructure are responsible for better charge transport as well
as provide high surface area for adsorption of sensitizer.

TEM image of meso-ZnO HS. the inset shows the SAED pattern of ZnO
HS.

3.4 BET Analysis
The surface area and
porous structure are the key factors for the photoanodic material
in DSSCs. The porous structure favors light trapping and facilitates
electrolyte penetration while the later tends to increase the dye
adsorption, providing a higher number of species accountable for photogenerated
electrons and thus increases the photocurrent.47 The porous structure and pore size distribution of the
as-prepared ZnO hollow spheres are investigated by performing the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement. As shown in Figure 5, the N2 physisorption isotherm exhibits H3 hysteresis and type IV isotherm
loops according to the Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller
classification, confirming the mesoporous nature of ZnO HS, a prerequisite
for DSSC applications.65,66 The BET surface area of the ZnO
HS was observed to be ∼40.3 m2/g. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution curve shows the uniformly distributed
pores of ∼15 nm, as can be seen from FESEM analysis. Owing
to the mesoporous nature and high surface area, meso-ZnO HS can offer
sufficient adsorption sites for the dye and also the electrolyte can
easily be infiltrated for dye regeneration, which is limited in the
case of solid hierarchical structures, as depicted in the schematic
(inset to Figure 5).
However, the BET surface area for a SnO2 nanoparticle is
found to be 46.5 m2/g (Figure S5).

spheres. The inset shows the BJH pore size distribution plot for meso-ZnO
hollow spheres, and the schematic depicts electrolyte diffusion pathways
through the pores.

3.5 UV–Vis
Diffused Reflectance Analysis
UV–vis DRS analysis
of photoanode films based on pristine
SnO2 NP (black line), SZ10 (red line), SZ20 (blue line), and SZ30 (magenta line) deposited
on glass substrates prior to dye sensitization is shown in Figure 6. The composite photoanodic
film SZ10, containing 10% ZnO HS, shows higher diffused
reflectance than the pristine SnO2 film due to enhanced
scattering and reflection of the incident light within the interior
cavity of the hollow structure, enhancing scattering in between hollow
spheres and from the ensemble as well.67 The diffused reflectance further increases with the increase in
ZnO HS content, and the composite with 30% ZnO HS (SZ30) exhibits the highest reflectance among all of the photoanodes in
the wavelength range 600–800 nm. EDX mapping analysis as shown
in Figure S7 depicts that meso-ZnO hollow
spheres are distributed homogeneously in the photoanode composite
(SZ20), contributing to the effective light harvesting
through trapping of light. Pictorial representation of various light-scattering
pathways in the hybrid photoanode has been depicted in Scheme 2. The inset to Figure 6 depicts the digital images
of different photoanodes fabricated using SnO2 nanoparticles,
SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30. It has been
observed that although the SZ30 photoanode shows the highest
reflectance, but at the same time, the opaqueness of the photoanodic
film increases with an increase in the concentration of micron-sized
meso-ZnO HS, thus preventing the penetration of incident light, causing
adverse effect on the photovoltaic performance. Moreover, back-scattered
light at the FTO junction will cause hindrance to light penetration
on increasing ZnO HS concentration.

Scheme 2 Light Scattering Pathways in the Composite Photoanode
Note that incoming photon flux
undergoes multiple reflections within the hollow cavity of meso-ZnO
HS as well as from the ensemble, thereby increasing the optical path
length. Please note that the light-scattering pathways shown here
are relative representations only.

3.6 Photovoltaic Performance
To explore
the potential of hybrid photoanodes in harnessing solar energy, photovoltaic
performance of the fabricated SnO2 NP as well as composite
SZ10-, SZ20-, and SZ30-based devices
was evaluated and photovoltaic parameters, viz., current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE, are summarized in Table 1.

From Figure 7, it is seen that the photovoltaic device with pristine SnO2 nanoparticles exhibited a Jsc ≈ 7.82 mA/cm2, Voc ≈ 384 mV, and FF ≈ 35%, affording a PCE ≈ 1.15%.
On the other hand, ZnO hollow sphere-loaded SnO2 NP composite-based
devices, viz., SZ10, afforded a PCE ≈ 3.29% with Jsc ≈ 9.58 mA/cm2, Voc ≈ 612 mV, and FF ≈ 56% and
SZ20 afforded a PCE ≈ 4.37% with Jsc ≈ 11.01 mA/cm2, Voc ≈ 632 mV, and FF ≈ 63%, whereas the device
with 30% ZnO HS, SZ30, showed lower performance, yielding Jsc ≈ 8.89 mA/cm2, Voc ≈ 638 mV, FF ≈ 64.6%, and PCE
≈ 3.67%. The increase in the device efficacy, i.e., for SZ10 and SZ20, is mainly accredited to the increase
in Jsc and Voc. The enhanced Jsc in the case of composite
photoanodes SZ10 and SZ20 is due to better light-harnessing
capacity of photoanodes with nano-amassed micron-sized meso-ZnO HS
and a reduced recombination of photoinjected electrons at the semiconductor/electrolyte
interface. From the chemisorption analysis (Table S2), it is seen that there is a slight increase in the dye
loading capacity of the composite photoanode, which may be due to
the comparable surface area and higher IEP value of nano-amassed meso-ZnO
HS. Hence, the light harvesting in the case of hybrid photoanodes
is solely due to the enhanced light reflection/scattering properties
of the composite photoanodes, thereby allowing trapping of the incident
light within their cavity and increasing the optical path of incident
light by scattering phenomenon promoting interaction between incident
photons and the dye molecules. The enhanced light scattering by the
meso-ZnO hollow spheres as well as multiple reflections within the
ensemble increases the possibility of harvesting the incident light,
eventually absorbed by the dye molecule, and in return boosting the
photogenerated current, i.e., Jsc. Second,
the inhibited back-recombination of photogenerated electrons imposed
by the higher conduction band level of ZnO as compared to that of
SnO2 also adds to the increase in Jsc. The lower value of Voc shown
by SnO2 NP-based devices is due to faster recombination
of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 nanoparticles to the redox mediator, resulting from the reactive
low-energy trap states of SnO2. However, in the case of
composite photoanodes, we observed a dramatic increase in the open-circuit
potential or Voc (Table 1). Voc of
a DSSC device is defined as the difference between the redox potential
of the redox shuttle and the Fermi energy level of the metal oxide
semiconductor, and the increase in the Voc in the case of SZx (x = 10–30%) devices can be attributed to the shift of the conduction
band edge of SnO2 on addition of ZnO, resulting in a higher
quasi-Fermi level as well as inhibited reverse tunneling of photogenerated
electrons from the CB of SnO2. A decrease in the chemical
capacitance of SnO2 results in a decrease in the combined
capacitance of the mixed electrode, thus shifting the CB position
toward the vacuum level.68 On the other
hand, a significant increase in the fill factor (FF) from ∼35%
(SnO2 nanoparticle) to ∼56% (SZ10) and
to ∼65% (SZ30) in the case of composite photoanode
devices has been observed. An increase in the fill factor with the
introduction of meso-ZnO HS can be ascribed to the higher CB position
of meso-ZnO HS, which serves as a thermodynamic energy barrier for
minimum photoinduced electron interception, thereby increasing the
efficiency,69,70 whereas the pores of meso-ZnO
HS provide a pathway for regeneration of dye in the respective layers
by the redox couple.71 Although the scattering
ability of photoanode SZ30 is more as compared to that
of the other composite photoanodes, an increase in the concentration
of ZnO HS from 20 to 30% results in deterioration of device performances.
This decrease in the device performance can be attributed to the increased
opaqueness of the photoanode, thus hindering the light penetration;
as a result, the overall photovoltaic performance decreased. With
the increase in the amount of nano-amassed meso-ZnO HS, the amount
of back-scattered light also increases, leading to a lower light-absorption
ability. To estimate the photocurrent features of the DSSCs, photocurrent
action spectra of the DSSCs are recorded against a wavelength range
of 360–800 nm. In principle, the IPCE characteristic of a photovoltaic
device depends upon (i) the light-harvesting efficiency of the photoanode,
(ii) the quantum yield of photoinduced electron injection, and (iii)
the efficiency of collecting these injected electrons.72Figure 8 displays photosensitization in the whole visible region achieved
by the dye with maximum IPCE values of ∼46, ∼56, ∼62,
and ∼52% at ∼525 nm for the devices based on SnO2 nanoparticles, SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30, respectively. The higher IPCE values at a longer wavelength
observed in the IPCE spectra in the case of composite photoanodes,
viz., SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30, depict
an enhanced light-harvesting and scattering ability of micron-sized
ZnO HS, which adds to increase the overall PCE of the devices. The
better light-harnessing ability is accredited to the efficient sensitization
of photoanodes with meso-ZnO hollow spheres and light confinement
within the photoanodes of composite devices owing to the hollow architecture
as well as light-scattering ability of meso-ZnO HS. These features
lead to the enhanced absorption of solar light and an increase in
the quantum yield of photogenerated electron injection in the composite
devices. Furthermore, the efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye
molecule by the electrolyte, due to the facilitated electrolyte diffusion
through the pores of meso-ZnO HS in the photoanodes, reduces the recombination
rate and increases the charge collection, thus improving the
IPCE. From the EDS mapping in Figure S7, it is clearly seen that nano-amassed meso-ZnO HS are homogeneously
distributed throughout the specified region, leading to better light
trapping and scattering, resulting in a higher light-harnessing ability
as compared to that of the pristine SnO2 nanoparticle-based
photoanode. The decreased IPCE value in the case of SZ30 as compared to that in SZ20 is due to higher back-scattering
by micron-sized meso-ZnO HS at the FTO junction as well as increased
opaqueness of the photoanodic film device resulting in a reduced charge
collection efficacy (as can be seen in inset to Figure 6).

3.7 EIS Analysis
Electron transport kinetics
and energetics of interfacial recombination in fabricated bare as
well as composite based DSSCs have been investigated by carrying out
EIS measurements for the best-performing devices in a frequency range
of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under dark conditions at an external bias equivalent
to Voc, as shown in Figures 9 and 10, and the fitting
data are given in Table 2. EIS for the DSSCs typically explicates the characteristic charge
transfers occurring at various interfaces in different frequency regions,
viz., at the CE/electrolyte interface (1–100 kHz) and at the
semiconductor/electrolyte interface (0.1–1 kHz), and the diffusion
of electrolyte (0.1–0.01 kHz).59,73

In
the equivalent circuit, resistance Rs is
the sheet resistance related to the resistance of the TCO, CE
material; Rct1, the resistance of electrolyte,
is the charge-transfer resistance of the counter electrode; CPE1 is
the constant-phase element of the counter electrode; Rct2 is the charge-transfer resistance of the working electrode;
and CPE2 is the constant-phase element of the working electrode. In
the typical Nyquist plot, the semicircle in the mid-frequency region
reveals the charge recombination resistance, which is attributed to
the charge-transfer resistance (Rct2)
at the metal oxide/sensitizer/electrolyte interface. As can be seen
from Table 2, the charge
recombination resistance Rct2 in the case
of the SnO2 nanoparticle device is quite low, ∼39.5
Ω only, which is due to the higher recombination of the photogenerated
electron at the SnO2/dye/electrolyte interface corroborating
the current–voltage analysis. However, in the case of the composite
photoanode, the value of Rct2 is much
higher than that of the pristine SnO2 nanoparticle and
further increases, i.e., from ∼121.2 Ω in the case of
SZ10 to ∼146.3 Ω in SZ20 and is
the highest in SZ30, ∼183.5 Ω, with an increase
in the meso-ZnO HS content.59 This observation
can be ascribed to inhibited recombination of photogenerated electrons
with the introduction of ZnO hollow spheres having a higher conduction
band level, as depicted in Scheme 3. Moreover, as can be seen from Table S4, there is a slight change in the Rct1 values of the as-fabricated devices, which may be
due to the fact that Pt–FTO is used in all of the device combinations.
However, a lower value of Rct1 among all
of the devices in the case of the SZ20 corroborates a better
catalytic activity as well as charge transfer dynamics of the counter
electrode for this device.74,75 Moreover, mesoporous
ZnO hollow spheres also facilitate the penetration of electrolyte
to regenerate the oxidized dye.

Scheme 3 Schematic Representation of the Inhibited
Electron Interception in
the Case of the SnO2 NP_ZnO HS Composite Photoanode at
the Semiconductor/Dye/Electrolyte Interface
Corresponding Bode phase plots for the fabricated devices
are represented
in Figure 10. The
two peaks at two different frequency regions endorse the two diode
interfaces present in DSSCs. The characteristic phase angle peaks
at the mid-frequency region are located at ∼40.3, ∼31.4,
∼14.6, and ∼12.4 Hz for pristine SnO2 nanoparticle,
SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30 devices, respectively.
From the Bode phase plot, the values of τe (photoinduced
electron lifetime) are evaluated using the following relation, τe = 1/(2πfp), where fp is the observed maximum peak frequency in
the mid-frequency region.25 It has been
found that the τe values for different photoanodes
are 3.9, 5.1, 10.9, and 12.6 ms for SnO2 nanoparticle,
SZ10, SZ20, and SZ30 devices. The
gradual increase in the photoinduced electron lifetime for the composite-based
devices as compared to that for pristine SnO2 photoanode-based
device with an increase in the meso-ZnO HS content also validates
the interference created by addition of meso-ZnO HS, acting as a partial
barrier for photoinduced electrons to undergo recombination at the
semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interface. Moreover, a type II band
alignment formed between well-matched band positions of SnO2 and ZnO heterostructures results in a charge carrier separation
(electrons on SnO2 and holes on ZnO), which leads to reduced
recombination and thus increases charge carrier lifetimes, as shown
in Scheme 3.76

The electron recombination kinetics was
further investigated by
carrying out the transient open-circuit voltage decay measurement.
Once the light is turned off under the open-circuit condition, the
decrease in electron density in the CB and thus decay of the Voc is solely due to electron recombination.77 The Voc decay rate
is directly determined by the recombination rate.

It is evident
from the Voc decay that,
as shown in Figure 11, the SnO2 nanoparticle-based photoanode shows a faster
decay as compared with other composite photoanodes, corroborating
the faster recombination kinetics in the device. The Voc decay becomes significantly slow as we move from SZ10 to SZ30, inferring a better charge transport
and impeded recombination of photogenerated electrons on meso-ZnO
HS loading. Although the charge transport properties of device with
photoanode SZ30 is better than SZ20, till it
furnishes lower efficiency that is mainly due to the less dye adsorption
as well hindrance in light penetration resulting in a lower photogenerated
electron thus decreases photogenerated current whereas the better
performance of SZ20 device can be accredited to optimal
concentration of meso-ZnO HS loading with combined effect of efficient
light harvesting through optical absorption and confinement as well
as enhanced charge transport properties at the interface.

fabricated devices based on the SnO2 nanoparticle film

and SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (7:3), SZ30 (magenta line).

4 Conclusions
In brief, a practical approach for superior light harnessing and
impeded reverse tunneling of photogenerated electrons in a SnO2 NP-based device was demonstrated by introducing a cost-effective,
easily synthesizable nano-amassed meso-ZnO HS. Micron-sized meso-ZnO
HS can effectively scatter the incident light as well as traps the
light inside the cavity by multiple reflections, thus increasing the
probability of harnessing the incident light within the photoanode
and thus enhancing the device efficacy. On the other hand, meso-ZnO
HS can act as a thermodynamic energy barrier for back-recombination
of photoinduced electrons at the working electrode/sensitizer/electrolyte
interface owing to its higher CB position and also facilitates the
diffusion of electrolyte through pores for regenerating the oxidized
dye molecule. We have carried out systematic photovoltaic studies
by varying the amount of meso-ZnO HS added in different ratios to
SnO2, viz., SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (9:1), i.e., SZ10; SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (8:2), i.e., SZ20;
SnO2 NP_ZnO HS (7:3), i.e., SZ30; and device
SZ20 showed a nearly ∼4-fold increase in device
efficacy as compared with the reference SnO2 NP-based device.
The enhanced photovoltaic performance in the case of the composite
devices can be accredited to efficient light harnessing and better
interfacial charge transport properties on addition of nano-amassed
meso-ZnO HS.
