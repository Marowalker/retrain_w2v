Lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative
bacteria, is considered to lead to some disease development in commercial
crustaceans. However, mantis shrimps Oratosquilla oratoria (Crustacea: Stomatopoda) have a strong vitality and ability to resist
disease. To study the tolerance mechanism of mantis shrimp, transcriptome
analyses were conducted in hepatopancreas of O. oratoria under LPS challenge investigation. Totally, 84 547 044
clean reads were obtained from transcriptomes (43 159 230
in OP (control), 41 387 814 in OL (treatment), respectively).
Unigenes, the longest transcript of each gene, with a total length
of 68 318 880 bp and the total number of 100 978
were obtained. 8369 (8.28%) of unigenes were successfully annotated
in all databases and 54 888 (54.35%) were annotated in at least
one database. Finally, 1012 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
including 439 and 573 showed significantly upregulated and downregulated
were determined between OL and OP, respectively. Moreover, those DEGs
only expressed in OL or OP accounted for 8.99%. The functional classification
based on GO and KEGG indicated that the common enrichment categories
for the DEGs are “amino sugar metabolic” and “cellular
homeostasis” and that the progress of nutrient metabolic and
homeostasis in cells is important in facing variable environmental
conditions. Protein–protein interaction analysis elucidated
proteins, β-actin (ACTB_G1), T-complex protein subunits (TCPs),
heat shock proteins (HSPs), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like protein
2 (HSDL2), kinesin family member 5 (KIF5), methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase
(AUH), and myosin heavy chain (MYH) may play key roles in response
to an LPS challenge. This study laid a foundation to further investigate
the possible adaptation way that O. oratoria survives in a bacterial challenge.

1 Introduction
Diseases
in aquaculture are increasing in both frequency and intensity,
and for crustaceans, a recent report mentions that up to 40% of total
shrimp production was lost annually mainly due to disease impacts.1 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component
of Gram-negative bacteria, was considered to lead to some disease
development in crustaceans.2,3 Some crustacean diseases,
such as early mortality syndrome (EMS), milky hemolymph disease (MHD),
and necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (NHP) were caused by bacterial
agents.1 These diseases also represented
the toxic effects of bacterial pathogens. It is important to understand
the toxicity mechanism of bacterial pathogens in crustaceans, especially
those with high economic values.

LPS, a key component of pathogenic Vibrio, has
been widely utilized in studies on the toxic effects, the toxicity
mechanism in crustaceans,1,4−8 and the response to toxicity stress.9−12 For example, pathogenic Vibrio has been shown to colonize the gastrointestinal tract
of shrimps and produce a toxin (a highly positively charged protein
manufactured by the EMS strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus) that can cause tissue destruction and dysfunction of the hepatopancreas.1,13 Meanwhile, it has been indicated that haemocyte apoptosis would
eliminate damaged or weak cells and contribute to haemocyte renewal
in response to toxicity from pathogens and that it may be a defense
strategy against pathogens in tiger shrimp Penaeus
monodon.11 Recently, the
development of high-throughput RNA-sequencing studies had made some
efforts based on “Big Data” from transcriptome to reveal
the response mechanism in response to various stimuli including LPS.14−17 It is known that mainly important immune-related pathways were involved
in response to LPS including MAPK, NF-κB, and Jak-STAT signaling
pathways.18 However, some other pathways
may also refer to an LPS challenge.19,20 Moreover,
several important proteins in MAPK, NF-κB, and Jak-STAT signaling
pathways had also been elucidated to play a role in response to LPS
in the Eriocheir sinensis transcriptome.3 Transcriptome has been applied in various crustaceans,
such as Litopenaeus vannamei, Sinopotamon henanense, Triops longicaudatus, Scylla paramamosain, and Exopalamon carincauda.14,21−23 Thus, transcriptome analysis may be a powerful tool to reveal some
mechanisms in response to various stimuli from the environment.

Mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) is one of the commercially valuable aquatic species in the Indo-West
Pacific region, and they have a strong vitality and ability to resist
bacterial infection and heavy metals.24,25 However, less
information about the tolerance mechanism to pathogenic bacteria was
available until now on O. oratoria.
Therefore, to reveal the antibacterial mechanism on this species,
this study investigated mantis shrimp’s responses to an LPS
challenge at the transcriptome level.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Sample Collection and Treatment
Twenty
individuals O. oratoria (length: 11.8
± 0.5 cm) were collected from the aquatic market in October 2016
in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China. Then, they were acclimatized
at 20° centigrade for 72 h prior to the natural environment.
Twenty individuals were divided into two groups (ten control groups
(OP) and ten treatment groups (OL)). All treatment groups were injected
with 5 mg/kg of LPS (L-2654, Sigma) in 15 μL of PBS, and the
control groups were injected with 15 μL PBS. The hepatopancreas
in two groups was collected after 24 h, frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at −80 °C for later experiments.

2.2 RNA Isolation and Library Construction
Total RNA was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad,
CA), and its concentration was measured using the Qubit RNA Assay
Kit in a Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. A total amount of 1.5 μg
RNA per hepatopancreas sample was used in this study. The integrity
of RNA was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of an Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA). Libraries were
generated using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
(NEB) following manufacturer’s instructions, and index codes
were added to attribute sequences to each sample.

2.3 Sequencing and De Novo Transcriptome Assembly
The libraries
were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq. 2500 platform.
Raw data (raw reads) in fastq format were first processed using in-house
perl scripts. Next, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing
reads containing adapters, reads containing poly-N, and low-quality reads. Transcriptome assembly was performed using
the Trinity program.26 During assembly,
sequences were clustered by Corset to remove redundant sequences,
and these sequences were defined as transcripts.27 Finally, unigenes were produced from the transcript sequences
according to the longest transcript for each gene.

2.4 Functional Unigene Annotation and Classification
Unigenes
were annotated based on the following databases: Nr/Nt
(NCBI nonredundant protein/nucleotide sequences) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Pfam (Protein family) (https://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), Swiss-Prot (A manually annotated
and reviewed protein sequence database) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot), KOG/COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/), KO (KEGG Ortholog database) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), and GO (Gene Ontology) (http://www.geneontology.org/). To obtain significant annotations, alignments in these databases
use 10–5 as the cut-off E-value.
The further classification of functional unigenes were conducted mainly
by Gene Ontology (GO) terms using Blast2GO and KEGG.28,29

2.5 Determination of Differentially Expressed
Genes (DEGs) and Their Enrichment
The determination of DEGs
between the two groups was performed using the DESeq R package.30 The resulting p-values were
adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false
discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted p-value <0.05
as identified by DESeq were assigned as differentially expressed.
A Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed
using the GOseq R package based on Wallenius’ noncentral hypergeometric
distribution, which can adjust for gene length bias in DEGs. We used
KOBAS software to test for statistical enrichment of the DEGs in Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.31

2.6 Analysis of Protein–Protein
Interactions
(PPIs)
The sequences of the DEGs were blasted against the
genome of a related species (the protein interactions of which can
be found in the STRING database [http://string-db.org/]) to predict PPIs. The PPI network of
the DEGs was visualized in Cytoscape.32

3 Results
3.1 Sequencing and De Novo
Transcriptome Assembly
A total of 84 547 044
clean reads were obtained in
the two transcriptomes (43 159 230 in OP and 41 387 814
in OL); 59.33% (25 604 604) and 65.56% (27 132 468)
of the clean reads in OP and OL, respectively, were successfully mapped
onto the reference (i.e., the sequences that assembled clean reads).
Further de novo transcriptome assembly based on hierarchical clustering
using Corset showed that the total length and number of transcripts
were 108 261 683 bp and 244 699, respectively.
Moreover, 100 978 unigenes were obtained with a total length
of 68 318 880 bp. The length of an assembled transcriptome
(e.g., the maximum, average, and minimum) indicates the reliability
of the assembly, especially the N50 value, which serves as a relative
standard to determine the quality of the transcriptome assembly; these
characteristics are provided in Table 1.33 In this study, the N50
value was determined to be 489 and 801 bp for transcripts and unigenes,
respectively; these values are not small compared with similar studies.34,35 The most abundant transcripts were clustered in a group of <301
bp in length, the most abundant unigenes were clustered in a group
of 501–1000 bp in length, and 2963 unigenes were clustered
in a group of >2000 bp in length (Figure 1). The assembly results also indicate that
the length distribution pattern and mean length of the unigenes are
consistent with those in previous transcriptome studies using the
Illumina HiSeq platform.22,36

3.2 Unigene Annotation and Functional Classification
Annotation of the 100 978 unigenes in seven databases (National
Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] nonredundant protein [Nr],
NCBI nucleotide sequences [Nt], KEGG Orthology [KO], GO, Swiss-Prot,
protein family [Pfam], and EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups [KOG]) showed
that 8369 (8.28%) unigenes were successfully annotated in all databases
and 54 888 (54.35%) were annotated in at least one database.
Thus, more than 40% of the unigenes could not be annotated. Most of
the unigenes were annotated in GO (37 686, 37.32%) followed
by Nr (36 963, 36.61%) and Swiss-Prot (36 948, 36.59%)
(Table 2).

total unigenes	100 978	100	
Functional classification of the
unigenes was achieved by GO and
KEGG analyses. In the GO analysis, the annotated unigenes (37 686)
were classified into three categories: “cell component”,
“biological process”, and “molecular function”.
These categories included 165 662, 509 444, and 79 556
unigenes, respectively (Figure 2). In the KEGG analysis, most of the unigenes (18 583)
analyzed were assigned to “metabolism” (7444) compared
with “cellular processes” (3354), “environmental
information processing” (2645), “genetic information
processing” (4897), and “organismal systems”
(6170) (Figure 3).
Genes like NfKb,37 a member
of the RAS oncogene family (RAP1A), and activating
transcription factor 1 (ATF),38 which have been reported to respond to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), were also annotated in this study. Annotation and functional
classification of the unigenes laid the foundation for further functional
enrichment analysis of DEGs.

unigenes: 3 categories
and 56 sub-categories.

database annotations of assembled unigenes.

3.3 DEGs and Functional Enrichment
A
total of 1012 DEGs were selected according to the q-value (adjusted p-value) and |log2 (fold change)|
value (>1). Of the 1012 DEGs, 439 and 573 were significantly upregulated
and downregulated, respectively, between OL and OP (Figure 4). Moreover, the DEGs expressed
only in OL or OP accounted for a total of 8.99% (Table S1); these DEGs play important roles in adaption to
an LPS challenge. In this study, the functional enrichment of DEGs
by GO analysis first showed that the DEGs were primarily significantly
enriched in root categories with the terms “biological process”
and “molecular function” with an adjusted p-value of <0.05 (Figure 5). Descendent GO terms included the “amino sugar metabolic
process”, “chitin metabolic process”, “cellular
metal ion homeostasis”, and “chitin binding”.
Functional enrichment based on KEGG pathway analysis revealed that
these DEGs could be assigned to 201 pathways, and the number of DEGs
ranged from 1 to 17. Of these pathways, 25 had a p-value <0.05 (Table S2), indicating
that according to Hui, 25 pathways might be associated with the response
to an LPS challenge.15 The top 20 pathways
were selected, and 6 pathways (“protein digestion and absorption”,
“ECM-receptor interaction”, “neuroactive ligand-receptor
interaction”, “focal adhesion”, “amebiasis”,
and “amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism”) had
adjusted p-values of <0.05 (Figure 6). Thus, genes involved in these pathways
may be important in response to an LPS challenge. Finally, six upregulated
and eight downregulated pathways were significantly enriched (adjusted p-value <0.05).

3.4 PPIs of DEGs
PPI analysis allowed
us to further characterize the DEGs. DEGs with a higher “degree”
are more likely to play a key role in response to an LPS challenge,
as a higher degree suggests a more important function.39 In this study, higher degree DEGs included those
encoding β-actin (ACTB_G1), T-complex protein subunits (CCT6,
CCT8, and CCT5, also known as TCPs), heat shock proteins (HSPA5 and
HSPA1_8), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like protein 2 (HSDL2), and
kinesin family member 5 (KIF5) (Table 3 and Figure S1). ACTB_G1
was assigned to “focal adhesion” with an adjusted p-value of <0.05.

4 Discussion
Cell matrix adhesion plays essential roles in important biological
processes, including cell motility, proliferation, differentiation,
gene expression regulation, and survival (ko04510). Although ACTB_G1
is involved in basic housekeeping functions, varying expression levels
of ACTB_G1 in response to different stimuli, including exposure to
madrigal (downregulation), herpes simplex virus type 1 (downregulation),
hormones and serum (upregulation), have been reported.40 However, whether upregulation of ACTB_G1 occurs
in response to an LPS challenge remains unclear. T-complex proteins
(CCT6, CCT8, and CCT5) and heat shock proteins, which act as chaperonins,
function not only in proper protein folding but are also involved
in immune responses.41 Although its function
is generally unknown, HSDL2 may function as a regulatory factor in
fatty acid metabolism.42,43 In human glioblastoma cell lines,
HSDL2 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation, resulting
in cancer cell apoptosis.43 In O. oratoria, upregulation of HSDL2 might be a negative
response to an LPS challenge. Similar to HSDL2, upregulation of methylglutaconyl-CoA
hydratase (AUH) may also be a negative response to an LPS challenge.
AUH is present in mitochondria, with an enriched distribution in organs
with higher energy demands; however, both the knockdown and overexpression
of AUH have been linked to a decreased abundance of respiratory complexes.44 The kinesin KIF5, upregulated in “endocytosis”
with a p-value <0.05, also caught our attention.
However, the functional significance of members of the kinesin family
is only partially understood.45 To date,
the primary function of kinesins is in the axonal transport of membrane
proteins and KIF5 has been shown to regulate endosomal membrane traffic
to mediate a variety of physiological functions.45−47 Therefore,
KIF5 may be indirectly involved in the response to an LPS challenge.48 In this study, myosin heavy chain (MHC) with
five direct edges in PPI analysis was also investigated. Unlike vertebrates,
in which the function of MHC has been well studied, only limited information
is available regarding invertebrate MHC. For example, one type of
human MHC has been shown to suppress the heat-induced death of airway
smooth muscle cells.49 In crustaceans,
studies have focused on the characterization of muscle, since myosin
is the major protein found in skeletal muscle.48 Fortunately, research into disease pathology based on natural
history data and experimental interventions has indicated that changes
in MHC expression might confer some resistance to damage to compensate
for dystrophic dysfunction.50 Upregulated
MHC in O. oratoria in response to an
LPS challenge might be associated with this protective mechanism.

The response of the mantis shrimp to an LPS challenge at the transcriptome
level indicates the following: First, the common enrichment categories
of the DEGs were “amino sugar metabolic” and “cellular
homeostasis”, which complied with the objective rule that metabolic
processes and homeostasis in cells are important in facing variable
environmental conditions. Second, the pathways “protein digestion
and absorption”, “ECM-receptor interaction”,
“neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”, “focal
adhesion”, and “amebiasis” with adjusted p-values of <0.05 should be investigated in future studies.
Third, our PPI analysis revealed that ACTB_G1, TCPs, HSPs, HSDL2,
KIF5, AUH, and MYH might play key roles in response to an LPS challenge.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the DEGs annotated as ACTB_G1,
CCT6, CCT8, HSPA5, HSDL2, and KIF5 were upregulated in the treatment
group compared to the control (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Results of representative DEGs between RT-PCR and RNA-seq.

Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a member of a family
of transcription
factors that function as dimers and regulate genes involved in immunity,
inflammation, and cell survival. The canonical NF-κB pathway
is induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, or byproducts
of bacterial and viral infections.19,51−53 The “NF-kappa B signaling pathway” in this study was
enriched for two upregulated unigenes (Cluster-42114.8893 and Cluster-42114.14556),
which were annotated as COX2 and NFKB1.20 When we combined the GO and KEGG enrichment results, the common
enrichment categories of the DEGs were amino sugar metabolic and cellular
homeostasis, which were partly consistent with a proteomic study of
the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicas (“amino sugar metabolic”).20 In immune cells, metabolic processes and cellular homeostasis are
important; these cells patrol the body via the bloodstream and migrate
into different tissues where they face variable environmental conditions,
different substances, and changes in oxygen levels.54 In the present study, the common enrichment categories
comply with the objective rule that O. oratoria responded to an LPS challenge.
