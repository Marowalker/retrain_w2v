Stimuli-responsive
polymer architectures are attracting a lot of
interest, but it still remains a great challenge to develop effective
industrial-scale strategies. A single-stage and cost-effective approach
was applied to fabricate a three-dimensional (3D) smart responsive
surface with fast and reversibly switchable wetting between superhydrophobicity
and superhydrophilicity/underwater superoleophobicity properties induced
by photo and heat stimuli. Commercially available PVDF and P25TiO2 as starting materials fabricated with a scaled-up electrospinning
approach were applied to prepare 3D smart switchable PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile superwetted by both UV and solar light that is
simply recovered by heat at a reasonable time. The superhydrophilic/underwater
superoleophobic photo-induced nanotextile will act in “water-removing”
mode in which water quickly passes through and the oil is blocked
on the surface. An acceptable recycling, reusing, and superior antifouling
and self-cleaning performance arising from a TiO2 photocatalytic
effect makes it highly desired in a green scaled-up industry oily
wastewater treatment technology. With these advantages, a large-scale
industrial production process can be simply simulated by applying
a conducting mesh-like collector substrate.

Introduction
Smart polymer membrane
materials with controlled reversible wetting
transitions can be highly desired to explore a unique solution for
treatment of both oil-polluted water and water-polluted oil from complex
sources.1−13 Such a remarkable ability of the controlled surface wettability
including superhydrophobic/superoleophilic or superhydrophilic/underwater
superoleophobic properties results from a synergistic effect of the
chemical composition and the surface geometric structures, and it
can be highlighted on the surface roughness.1,14−18 The surfaces with a well-tuned wetting property are considered to
be fundamental in applications such as antimicrobial, antifogging,
antifouling, and self-cleaning as well as oil-repelling performance
required for an oil–water separation technology.4,10,19−21 Practically,
self-cleaning superwettable surfaces can be of great use in a new
green separation technology.22 Generally,
self-cleaning superwettable materials are classified into two categories:
Self-cleaning superhydrophilic surfaces, which will clean themselves
through repelling the oily pollutants or by applying the photo-activated
compounds, which degrade the organic pollutants to water and carbon
dioxide via the photocatalytic effect.23−27 On the other hand, the self-cleaning property is
achieved by the existence of the air pockets trapped onto the well-designed
substrate, which facilitate forming of spherically shaped water droplets
as effective pollutant carriers.19,28,29 So far, various approaches have been applied to produce
the flexible polymeric substrates with a unique controlled wetting
property.16,30−34 Both the intrinsic wettability and the surface roughness
are considered as key factors for an excellent wetting behavior. Amongst,
the electrospinning technique has become one of the most powerful
approaches to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical superwettable
materials due to its simplicity and low cost, which provide not only
various properties such as the ability to generate porous nanofibers
with small and uniform diameters, large specific surface areas, and
high structural alignment but also the multifunctional inorganic polymer
nanocomposites can be simply prepared: Multifunctionalized inorganic
materials will provide a special surface wetting behavior through
the treatment of the surface roughness and energy.23,35−45 More importantly, the as-spun polymer nanofibers provide highly
available functional groups suitable for selective interactions with
special molecules to enhance the surface wetting behavior.43,46 It is believed that these achievements are still restricted by parameters
such as high cost of reagents and equipment, time-consuming and complicated
synthetic methods, low flux, and fast pore fouling as well as pore
plugging caused by pollutant molecules, which all raise costs for
treatment of large effluent volumes in a practical way as well as
commercial purposes. Accordingly, the design of the novel and versatile
materials with reversibly switchable wettability stimulated through
external stimuli such as temperature, magnetic field, electric field,
light irradiation, pH, and special chemicals are of significant interest.1,2,14,47−53 Nevertheless, such smart switchable materials may not be viable
for device fabrication due to the production costs and reliability.
Accordingly, it still remains a great challenge to develop facile
and versatile strategies for the fabrication of reversibly switchable
wettability of surfaces. In this regard, it is believed that in situ
laboratory synthetic strategies so far reported for the preparation
of the photo-induced smart superwettable materials, for example, hierarchical
TiO2 nanostructures, can be harsh and require long reaction
times, and thus these approaches would be expensive and difficult
to be industrially scaled-up.1,23,25,50,51,54

We believe that the use of commercially
available starting materials,
poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and P25TiO2, combined
with the electrospinning technique as a versatile synthetic strategy
for the production of 3D smart superwetting nanotextile would reduce
costs and broaden the range of potential applications. Herein, we
describe a simple and versatile way to fabricate a 3D photo-induced
reversibly switchable superwetting material with the superior self-cleaning
and antifouling property resulting from the TiO2 photocatalytic
effect. The synthetic strategy is simple, fast, and industrially scaled-up,
and also starting materials, PVDF and P25TiO2, are readily
commercially available, which makes this work more and more interesting
in the fundamental and applied research. Fast and effective UV/solar
light-induced transferring of superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity/underwater
superoleophobicity makes it excellent as a versatile self-cleaning
technology in green industrial oil–water separation.

Results
and Discussion
Herein, 3D smart PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting
nanotextile
was prepared by a cost-effective and simply scaled-up electrospinning
approach. Commercially available PVDF and P25TiO2 as constructing
materials of electrospinning solution were applied to produce laboratory-scale
photo/heat-adjustable well-designed PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile
with a highly reversibly self-cleaning superwetting property, which
can potentially be used for large-scale industrial production by applying
a conducting mesh-like substrate as the collector of electrospinning
setup (Scheme 1).55,56 The structural morphology of the as-spun nanofibers was investigated
by SEM. In Figure 1b, various magnified SEM images of the as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile clearly present a well-rough surface at nanoscale arising
from the TiO2-shaped beads onto the nanotextile surface,
providing low surface energy suitable for the enhanced superhydrophobicity
with a water contact angle (WCA) of ∼154.9° ± 0.8
compared with the as-spun pure PVDF nanotextile with a WCA of 113.6°
± 1.2 (Figure 1a). As compared with pure PVDF electrospun nanostructures with an
average diameter of ∼230 nm, the electrospun PVDF-P25TiO2 fiber diameters are higher, confirming the presence of TiO2 nanostructures onto the electrospun nanofibers. The average
diameter of the as-prepared PVDF-P25TiO2 nanofibers is ∼673 nm. Moreover, the observed
peaks of Ti, O, C, and F elements in EDX analysis will present the
as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile characterizations (Figure 1c). The thermal stability
of the as-spun nanotextile was investigated by TGA (Figure 1d), exhibiting that the as-spun
thermally stable PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile with the initial
degradation temperature nearly 300 °C can be promising in the
oil–water separation technology. More importantly, a high intrinsic
chemical and mechanical resistance of the PVDF matrix to nearly all
oils and organic solvents along with a TiO2 photo-induced
self-cleaning effect makes the as-spun 3D smart PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile a versatile candidate in green scaled-up filtration
industries (Figure S1).57,58

As-Spun Nanotextile (Photograph Presents the Electrospun PVDF-P25TiO2 Nanofibers Collected on a Stainless Steel Mesh Collector)
To comprehensively investigate the photo-induced
reversibly switchable
wetting behavior of the as-prepared PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile,
both UV and solar light irradiation were applied as the irradiation
source. Figure 2 shows
the UV-induced superwetting behavior of the as-prepared PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile. Before the photo-irradiation, the as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile gives a WCA of 154.9° ± 0.8, which
is 41.3° higher than that of the pure electrospun PVDF nanotextile
with a WCA of 113.6° ± 1.2 (Figure 1), and thus such as-prepared PVDF-P25TiO2 superhydrophobic nanotextile could be effectively used for
the oil-polluted water removal (Video S1). After 50 min of UV light irradiation, the WCA was quickly decreased
to 7.6° ± 0.4, and then a nearly zero WCA was achieved after
55 min of irradiation. The reversibly switchable superwetting behavior
of the solar light-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile is
also exhibited in Figure 2. The effective transfer of superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity
as well as underwater superoleophobicity was achieved after nearly
3 h of local solar light irradiation at a fixed time of 8:00 to 12:00
am in summer. These results confirm that the superior superwetting
behavior can be simply achieved under both UV and solar light irradiation.
Furthermore, as it can be seen in Figure 2, the reversibly cycling behavior of the
photo/heat-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile after 10 cycles
clearly confirms their effective superwetting ability. As it is shown
in Figure 3a, a reversible
superhydrophobicity with the WCA of 152.7° is achieved again
when the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 superhydrophilic nanotextile
is placed in an oven at 70 °C for 60 min. Again, the reversible
superhydrophilicity is achieved after the photo-irradiation, and now
the heat-induced superhydrophobic material becomes superhydrophilic.
Such a cyclic process of PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting performance
could be repeated many times. Figure 4 shows the affinity of oil and water spreading onto
the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting nanotextile.
When a water droplet of nearly 4 μL is placed onto the photo-induced
PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile surface in air, it quickly spreads,
and a zero WCA is achieved. The whole process is completed within
0.43 s (Video S2). When an n-hexane droplet as the oil is placed onto the photo-induced superwetting
surface in air, it also spreads quickly within 0.37 s (Videos S2 and S3). However, the oil droplet stays
on the as-spun nanotextile without spreading with an oil contact angle
(OCA) of 167° ± 0.6 when it is placed under water.59 These results confirm that the photo-induced
PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting nanotextile is simultaneously
superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic. The oil and the water
spreading behavior in air and water for the as-prepared PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile before the photo-irradiation/light irradiation
or after heating treatment can be observed in Figure 4 too. A spherically shaped water droplet
with a WCA of 153.8° ± 1.1 in air, a thoroughly disappeared
oil droplet with an OCA of 0° in air for a whole time of 0.51
s, and a fast spreading of the OCA (chloroform as the oil) for the
sample placed under water within a whole time of 0.39 s were achieved.
This superior superwetting behavior is also observed when the hot
water droplet at a temperature of about 95 °C was tested (Videos S2 and S4).1,5,16 Furthermore, a very weak contact of the underwater
oil droplet placed on the photo-induced nanotextile confirms extremely
low adhesion force of the oil droplet adhered to the nanofiber surface
and thus can be featured as a superior underwater anti-oil adhesion
nanostructure, especially for an oily wastewater separation technology,
namely, “water-removing” process (Video S5).

The ability of a special superwetting nanotextile is proved
by
the effective oil–water separation performance.50,60 Herein, the separation capability of the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile for oil-in-water emulsions, both surfactant-free
and surfactant-stabilized emulsions, n-hexane-in-H2O, toluene-in-H2O, petroleum ether-in-H2O (petroleum/H2O), SDS-stabilized n-hexane-in-H2O, SDS-stabilized toluene-in-H2O, and SDS-stabilized
petroleum ether-in-H2O ( petroleum/SDS/H2O)
with an oil/water volume ratio of 1:99 was tested. The as-prepared
emulsions were then poured on the as-spun nanotextile to carry out
the filtration driven by a high applied pressure (1 bar), a small
applied pressure (0.1 bar), and also gravity only. All emulsions were
successfully separated in one step (Video S6). The oil content in water after a one-time separation was measured
by a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer. As shown in Figure 5a, the oil content in the filtrates
for the surfactant-free emulsions driven under a small applied pressure
of 0.1 bar and only gravity force are all below 40 ppm. For the surfactant-free
emulsions under a high applied pressure of 1 bar, the oil content
in the filtrates are in the range of 85–123 ppm. For the SDS-stabilized
emulsions driven by a small applied pressure of 0.1 bar and only gravity
force, the oil content in the filtrates are all below 70 ppm, and
under a high applied pressure of 1 bar, the oil content in the filtrates
are in the range of 113–137 ppm. These results reveal a highly
separation efficiency of the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile. The higher oil content obtained for the emulsions driven
under a high applied pressure of 1 bar can be resulted from the deformation
of emulsified droplets, which will facilitate their passing through
the pores of the textile. In comparison with the surfactant-free emulsions,
for SDS-stabilized emulsions, the higher oil content in filtrates
can be probably due to the presence of dissolved surfactants in the
filtrate. As shown in Figure 5b, the fluxes obtained for the emulsions driven under gravity
force only, n-hexane/H2O, toluene/H2O, petroleum/H2O, n-hexane/SDS/H2O, toluene/SDS/H2O, and petroleum/SDS/H2O are 4740, 5010, 4450, 3490, 3930, and 3720 Lm–2 h–1, respectively.29 The emulsions with 0.1 bar of applied pressure across the nanotextile
exhibit the fluxes of 5270, 5600, 5350, 4950, 5260, and 4930 Lm–2 h–1 for n-hexane/H2O, toluene/H2O, petroleum/H2O, n-hexane/SDS/H2O, toluene/SDS/H2O,
and petroleum/SDS/H2O, respectively. These values are somewhat
higher than those observed for the emulsions driven by gravity only.
For the separations driven by a high applied pressure of 1 bar, the
corresponding fluxes are 28,560, 30,500, 28,300, 21,100, 22,750, and
19,900 Lm–2 h–1, which are several
times higher than those of driven under a small applied pressure of
0.1 bar or gravity only (Table S1). Furthermore,
as shown in Figure 5c, the separation capability of the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile for oil-in-water emulsions with various amounts
of oil was also investigated. Petroleum/H2O emulsions with
the different oil and water volume ratios from 1:99 to 10:90 were
prepared, and the separation tests were investigated. The results
show that all of the emulsions could be completely separated but with
a decrease in flux with increasing the oil content in emulsion. To
investigate the separation performance of the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile, an optical microscope was used for displaying
the appearance difference between the original emulsion and the corresponding
collected filtrates. Figure 6a presents the separation performance of petroleum/H2O emulsion and petroleum/SDS/H2O emulsion. For both surfactant-free
and SDS-stabilized emulsions, dense oil droplets of microscale are
observed clearly in the original emulsions. Correspondingly, in the
collected filtrates, no droplets are observed in the images, indicating
the effectiveness of the as-prepared nanotextile for separating the
oil-in-water emulsions. Furthermore, Figure 6b clearly displays that the as-spun photo-induced
textile can be applied for separating the immiscible oil–water
mixtures in which the textile acts in “water-removing”
mode, where the water phase quickly passes through the mesh and the
oil phase still remains on the surface (Video S7).

mode and a clean water can be obtained.

To further confirm the durability in the wetting behavior of the
photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile, a set of separation
cycling tests were performed, as it is shown in Figure 5d. The superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic
photo-induced textile will act in “water-removing” mode
in which water quickly passes through and the oil is blocked on the
surface. The wetting recovery is simply conducted by rinsing the textile
with ethanol, drying at room temperature, and the textile again is
used as a “water-removing” filter. The variation of
the oil content in filtrates and their flux during this process were
determined. It can be seen that after nine cycles, the flux slightly
changes with time, and then it recovers almost to the starting flux
only after cleaning with ethanol followed by light irradiation (Figure S2). These results indicate an excellent
antifouling property and effective wetting storage stability of the
as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile for long-term use in medium
conditions.

Commercially, the “water-removing”
technology always
suffers from fouling issues arising from the oil adhesion onto the
surface, which will seriously restrict this technology from again
and long-term use. In this regard, the photo-activated materials such
as TiO2 have been considered as significant candidates
to effectively degrade the oily and organic compounds due to their
photocatalytic effect. Herein, the TiO2 photo-induced self-cleaning
capability of the as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile can
be of significant importance in the oil–water separation technology,
especially that such as-spun smart PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting
nanotextile will remain its superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity
ability for long-time storage. To investigate the antifouling and
self-cleaning performance, oleic acid as a non-volatile oily pollutant
was selected and then exposed to UV light irradiation, and the variation
of the WCA in air and underwater OCA of the as-spun smart superwetting
nanotextile was investigated (Figure 7a).61 The photo-induced
PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile presents a zero WCA in air. For
oleic acid-adhered PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile, the WCA of
154.1° ± 0.6 is observed, proving the adhesion of oleic
acid on the nanotextile. Interestingly, the superhydrophilicity and
underwater superoleophobicity are recovered again after UV light irradiation
for 2.5 h with the WCA of zero and the underwater OCA of 165.1°
± 0.3, respectively. To further confirm the antifouling and self-cleaning
performance, the TiO2 photo-degradation of oleic acid was
studied by FT-IR analysis, as it can be seen in Figure 7b.50,62 In the FT-IR spectrum
of the as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile without oleic acid,
any obvious peaks in the range of 2800–3000 cm–1 are not observed. Nevertheless, oleic acid-adhered PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile presents three characteristic peaks at 2856,
and 2929, and 1713 cm–1 ascribed to the stretching
vibration of −CH3, −CH2, and —C=O
of the oleic acid, respectively. Such characteristic peaks ascribed
to oleic acid in the FT-IR spectrum are not observed for the oleic
acid-adhered PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile exposed to UV light
irradiation for 2.5 h. Now, the FT-IR spectrum is similar to that
of without oleic acid that displays a superior antifouling and self-cleaning
capability of the photo-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile,
providing a versatile and effective strategy in green fundamental
and applied research with large-scale manufacturing.

angle photographs. (b) FT-IR spectra. (c) UV–Vis curves, displaying
that photo-activated TiO2 can degrade methylene blue dye
present in the oil–water mixture.

Furthermore, the capability of TiO2-induced degradation
of organic pollutants was examined by immersing the photo-induced
PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile into 10 mL of 500 μM methylene
blue aqueous solution. As shown in Figure 7c, the absorption intensity corresponding
to methylene blue decreases dramatically due to its decomposition
by the photo-activated TiO2, and a clean water is achieved
after UV treatment for 25 min.63 The additional
water purification performance makes the as-prepared nanotextile more
effective and promising in treating water pollution.

Eventually,
our studies show that the superior reversibly switchable
wetting behavior should be seriously dependent on the synthetic strategy
and resulting product properties, namely, the surface chemistry and
topography. For example, approximately, under the same processing
conditions, such a reversibly switchable wetting ability cannot be
achieved for the polymer film-like materials constructed by other
methods except the electrospinning technique. Herein, it is believed
that such a smart reversible superwetting property can be clearly
ascribed to combined characteristics of both TiO2 well-distributed
nanostructures and the as-spun hierarchical nanofibrous substrate;
the electrospinning strategy can be preferred to provide a homogeneous
distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles onto the nanoscaled
porous PVDF fibers that will effectively provide the characterizations
required for achieving the superior superwetting behavior.8 A simple mechanism is proposed to explain the
switching behavior of the as-spun smart PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting
nanotextile (Scheme 2).3,26 Herein, the reversibly surface superwetting
can be resulted from (a) the unique topography of the as-spun nanofibrous
textile that will effectively provide both the surface roughness and
3D multiscale interconnected pores and (b) the unique chemical composition
that can be ascribed to highly available oleophobic −CF2 functional groups of PVDF and well-rough TiO2 nanostructures.
Before the photo-irradiation, the air pockets entrapped in the 3D
interconnected pores of the PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile as
an effective hydrophobic medium cause the as-spun nanotextile to be
a superior hydrophobic and oleophilic material (Video S1). After the heat treatment or before the photo-irradiation,
the oil droplets are adsorbed by both highly available oleophilic
oxygen bridges of TiO2 and the −CF2 functional
groups of PVDF (step 1), leading the surface to be well oil wetted
(step 2). Now, the oil-spread layer is replaced with the air pockets
entrapped into pores, and finally the oil passes through due to the
3D capillary effect (step 3). After the photo-irradiation, simultaneously,
the oil and water filtration can be performed, the oleophilic −CF2 groups of PVDF will provide the oil spreading, while highly
available photo-induced hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of TiO2 cause the surface to be well water wetted. The reason for the photo-induced
underwater oleophobic wetting property can be resulted from the surrounding
of the oleophilic regions by water that will act as an effective oil
repellant material, and so it will induce the underwater superoleophobicity
to the surface.

Conclusions
In summary, we present the preparation of photo (UV/solar light)-induced
3D smart reversibly superwettable PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile
constructed by the electrospinning technique in a single step. Readily
commercially available PVDF and P25TiO2 as starting materials
fabricated with a versatile scaled-up electrospinning approach makes
it possible to be significantly desired in the fundamental and applied
research, especially as the filter in the industry-scale oily water
treatment. Effective transfer to the superhydrophobic surface can
be simply achieved by heat treatment. The transitions are easy to
manipulate and reversible for many times. More importantly, such photo-induced
smart PVDF-P25TiO2 superwetting nanotextile presents an
excellent self-cleaning and antifouling property to remove the organic
molecules through the TiO2 photocatalytic effect. With
these advantages, a large-scale industrial production process can
be simply simulated.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF; Kynar1 1000HD,
Atofina Co), TiO2 (Degussa, P25), oleic acid, sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS), acetone, N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMAc), n-hexane, chloroform, petroleum ether, toluene,
oil red, and methylene blue were all purchased from Merck Chemical
Company and were used as received. Stainless steel mesh (pore size:
1.8 cm) was cleaned with ethanol before use.

Preparation of Electrospun
3D PVDF-P25TiO2 Nanotextile
To obtain a proper
electrospinning solution of PVDF-P25TiO2, 1.3 g of PVDF
granules dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C
for 1 h was added into 10 mL of ultrasound acetone/DMAC (1/1, v/v)
solvent mixture containing 7 wt % P25TiO2 with respect
to the weight of the polymer and then magnetically stirred for 6 h
at 60 °C. To prevent the solvent evaporation, the solution was
prepared in a capped glass bottle. To fabricate the electrospun nanofibrous
textile, an electrospinning setup (Fanavaran Nano-Meghyas, Iran) was
used at room temperature with an applied voltage of 15 kV to the stainless
steel needle with a gauge size of 24. The distance between the spinneret
and collector was 25 cm, and the injection rate was 0.1 mL/h. The
relative humidity was regulated to be more than 50% by the injection
of steam stream into the electrospinning polymethylmethacrylate chamber.64 The as-spun PVDF-P25TiO2 nanofibers
were dried at 50 °C for 12 h to remove the residual solvent.
Pure PVDF nanofibers without TiO2 particles were prepared
as a reference with the same PVDF concentration and the abovementioned
operating conditions. For the preparation of the as-spun nanotextile
coated on the stainless steel mesh, the stainless steel mesh was considered
as the electrospinning collector.

Preparation of Oil-in-Water
Emulsions
Surfactant-free
oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by mixing water and oil (n-hexane, toluene, and petroleum ether) at 1:99 (v/v), and
the mixtures were ultrasonicated for more than 2 h to obtain homogeneous
emulsions. Within 1 h, no precipitation was observed in the emulsion
solutions when placed in ambient conditions. Surfactant (SDS)-stabilized
oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by adding the surfactant and
oil into deionized water under rapid stirring and then sonicated.
In detail, an SDS-stabilized petroleum ether-in-water emulsion (petroleum/SDS/H2O) was prepared by mixing petroleum ether and water (1:99,
v/v) with addition of 0.02 mg of SDS per milliliter of emulsion under
3000 rpm mechanical stirring for 1 h followed by sonication for more
than 1 h. The emulsions were investigated by optical microscopy observation.
Based on the same abovementioned method, the oil–water emulsions
at 2:98, 5:95, and 10:90 (v/v) ratios were also prepared. For all
cycling tests, a certain volume of emulsion was poured on the photo-induced
PVDF-P25TiO2 textile, and after the separation process,
the used textile was simply rinsed with 10 mL of ethanol and dried
at room temperature to recover the flux.

Reversibly Switchable Oil–Water
Separation
To
obtain the UV-induced PVDF-P25TiO2 nanotextile, the as-spun
nanofibers were irradiated at a fixed distance of 30 cm by three parallel
15 W Hg lamps (Philips TL-D) placed in a wooden box equipped with
air circulator. The solar light-induced wetting behavior of the-as
spun sample was investigated under a local solar light at a fixed
time of 8:00 to 12:00 am in summer. The oil–water separation
was conducted by using the as-spun nanotextile fixed on a glass apparatus
to separate oily water including immiscible oil–water (dyed
with methylene blue), surfactant-free oil–water emulsions,
and surfactant-stabilized oil–water emulsions, which passed
through the nanotextile and collected by a flask placed under it.
The flux was determined by calculating a certain volume of solution
passed through the nanotextile. The oil content in the filtrate was
measured by a using total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer.

Characterization
The morphology of the as-spun PVDF
nanofiber with and without TiO2 loading was observed using
a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi 54160, Japan)
equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector.
The nanofibers’ diameters were measured from SEM images using
the software Image J, and the average diameter was calculated from
the measurements of 50 nanofibers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR, Bruker 27) was applied to evaluate the antifouling and self-cleaning
performance of the as-spun smart nanotextile. TGA curves were obtained
by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Q50-TGA). Ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometry (UV–Vis, Varian) was used to study the photocatalytic
effect of the as-spun nanotextile. Contact angles (CA) and corresponding
measurements were measured with a homemade setup equipped with a Dino-lite
digital microscope (AM7915MZTL, Taiwan). To measure underwater oil
contact angles, the as-spun superwetting nanotextile was first immersed
in water, and after that the oil droplet (nearly 4 μL of chloroform)
(ρoil > ρwater) was carefully
dropped
onto the nanotextile surface from the bottom. For each value, five
measurements per sample were done, and the average contact angle value
was obtained using the software Photoshop and OriginPro.
