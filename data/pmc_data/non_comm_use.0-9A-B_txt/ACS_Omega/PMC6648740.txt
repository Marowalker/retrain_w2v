A remarkable
recent advancement has been the successful synthesis
of two-dimensional boron monolayers on metal substrates. However,
although up to 16 possible bulk allotropes of boron have been reported,
none of them possess van der Waals (vdW) layered structures. In this
work, starting from the experimentally synthesized monolayer boron
sheet (β12 borophene), we explored the possibility
for forming vdW layered bulk boron. We found that two β12 borophene sheets cannot form a stable vdW bilayer structure,
as covalent-like B–B bonds are formed between them because
of the peculiar bonding. Interestingly, when the covalently bonded
bilayer borophene sheets are stacked on top of each other, three-dimensional
(3D) layered structures are constructed via vdW interlayer interactions,
rather than covalent. The 3D vdW layered structures were found to
be dynamically stable. The interlayer binding energy is about 20 meV/Å2, which is close to the weakly bound graphene layers in graphite
(∼16 meV/Å2). Furthermore, the density functional
theory predicted electronic band structure testifies that these vdW
bulk boron crystals can behave as good conductors. The insights obtained
from this work suggest an opportunity to discover new vdW layered
structures of bulk boron, which is expected to be crucial to numerous
applications ranging from microelectronic devices to energy storage
devices.

1 Introduction
Following
the successful synthesis of graphene, it has created
a plethora of research activities in exploring the growth, structure,
and properties of a diverse array of two-dimensional (2D) materials.
2D materials exhibit extraordinary physical and chemical properties
that are being exploited in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, energy
storage, and thermoelectric and thermal management.1−6 As the nearest neighbor of carbon in the periodic table, boron is
expected to possess free-standing monolayer allotropes. However, a
graphene-like honeycomb sheet is unstable for boron because of its
trivalent outer shell four orbitals, hindering the formation of a
closed-shell electronic structure.7,8 Following the
initial theoretical works,9−13 monolayer boron polymorphs (i.e., borophene) are the subject of
interest owing to its extraordinary physical and chemical properties
and potential applications, and various ways to improve its stability
are proposed.14−30 Theoretical studies reveal that borophene possesses a number of
unique characteristics, including highly anisotropic electronic structure,31 mechanical compliance,32 superconducting ability at relatively high temperature,33,34 ultrahigh thermal conductance,35−37 and optical transparency.38

Because of the multicenter bonding nature,
where the bonds involve
multiple atoms sharing a certain amount of electrons, boron exhibits
up to 16 bulk allotropes,8,39 including rhombohedral
α-phase, β-phase, tetragonal T-phase, and γ-phase.
The multicenter characteristics of boron–boron bonding also
lead to the formation of configurationally varied 2D borophene sheets,
with different densities of atomic holes being indispensable for stabilizing
borophene structures.11,40 For example, different possible
borophene phases have been investigated, including hexagonal borophene,
β12, α, δ6, χ3 sheets, and so forth.40 Recently, several
boron monolayer sheets and boron nanoribbons have been experimentally
synthesized on metal substrates.41−46 Among the recently synthesized borophene allotropes, β12 borophene possesses ultrahigh thermal conductance35 and high property tenability.47 In particular, Dirac fermion states are predicted theoretically15 and observed experimentally.43 Thus, intense research activity has led to a series of
studies in exploring physical and chemical properties of this allotrope.48−50

These theoretical and experimental studies have motivated
increasing
interest in seeking new layered structures of boron. Naturally, a
rising question is whether there is bulk boron allotrope that can
possess layered structure. Moreover, is the interlayer interaction
likely van der Waals (vdW) type or not? This question is not trivial,
as bulk boron structures are not layered, although up to 16 phases
were reported.39,48 In this work, we report the first
vdW layered bulk boron structure constructed with covalently bonded
bilayer β12 borophene sheets. Its thermodynamic stability
is confirmed by phonon dispersion analysis, and a metallic band structure
is revealed through first-principles calculation.

2 Computational Methods
We performed the calculations of structural
and electronic properties
based on density functional theory (DFT)51 with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).52 The projector augmented wave method53,54 and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew, Burke,
and Ernzerhof (PBE)55 functional for the
exchange–correlation functional were used. The cutoff energy
of plane wave is set to 400 eV. The DFT calculation including Grimme’s
D3 dispersion correction scheme56 was employed
to account for the vdW interaction because the long-range weak interaction
is important for the construction of layered structures. A vacuum
layer of 30 Å was introduced to eliminate the interactions between
periodic images. A Monkhorst–Pack k-point57,58 grid of 9 × 15 × 1 was adopted for a 2D structure and
9 × 15 × 6 was used for a 3D structure. The criteria for
energy and atom force convergence were set to 10–5 eV per unit cell and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively, during the optimization.

The interatomic force constants (IFCs) and phonon dispersion relation
were obtained using Quantum ESPRESSO package59 within the frameworks of density functional perturbation theory
(DFPT). The GGA–PBE functional was adopted together with ultrasoft
pseudopotential. The Brillouin zone for 2D structures was sampled
with a 6 × 10 × 1 grid of k-point and a
3 × 5 × 1 grid of q-point, and the 6 ×
10 × 4 grid of k-point and the 3 × 5 ×
2 grid of q-point were used for 3D structures. Cutoff
energies of 40 Ry for plane wave and 400 Ry for electronic density
were adopted.

3 Results and Discussion
We begin with the well-known single-layer borophene (β12) sheet. The β12 sheet has a planar structure
that contains honeycombs plus additional boron atoms, which are present
in one column along the zigzag direction but absent in the next column.
The relaxed structure is shown in Figure 1, where the calculated lattice constants
are a1 = 5.076 Å and a2 = 2.928 Å, which are in good agreement with previously
reported calculation and experimental results.22,23,42 Similar to graphene, no buckling appeared
in the monolayer β12 borophene.

view of the optimized geometry structure
and (b) phonon dispersion relationship of AA-stacking bilayer β12 sheets. (c) Top view and side view of the optimized geometry
structure and (d) phonon dispersion relationship of AB-stacking bilayer
β12 sheets. In (a,c), the boron atoms in top (bottom)
layers are denoted in different colors. The optimized interlayer distance
is 3.25 (a) and 3.33 Å (c).

To construct the possible bulk layered structure, it is natural
to start from the monolayer sheet and stack the multilayer structures
layer-by-layer through vdW interaction. Considering its similarity
with graphene, we only consider two stacking patterns (AA- and AB-stacking)
of β12 with high symmetry in this work. Figure 1a shows the top view
and side view of the AA-stacking vdW bilayer β12 borophene
sheets. We then shift the top layer with respect to the bottom one
along the x-axis with a transverse displacement of
0.5 lattice constant to obtain the AB-stacking vdW bilayer β12 borophene, as shown in Figure 1c. This method is usually adopted to search
for the stable stacking patterns in vdW layered structures.60,61 For each structure, all atoms were allowed to relax. The optimized
interlayer spacing is 3.25 and 3.33 Å for AA- and AB-stacking
vdW bilayer β12 borophene sheets, respectively, confirming
the vdW-type interaction. However, although monolayer β12 borophene is thermodynamically stable,35 both AA- and AB-stacking vdW bilayer β12 borophene sheets are unstable, which is demonstrated by the obvious
imaginary frequencies in phonon dispersion, as shown in Figure 1b,d. This reveals the low possibility
to form a stable vdW layered structure based on monolayer β12 borophene.

To explore the possible stable structure
of bilayer β12 borophene, we further reduce the interlayer
spacing of AA-
and AB-stacking vdW bilayer β12 borophene from 5
to 1.5 Å and using the optimized in-plane lattice constant of
separated monolayer β12 as the initial lattice constants.
When the interlayer spacing is about 2 Å, stable AA- and AB-stacking
bilayer β12 borophene structures are formed, as shown
in Figure 2a,b. The
optimized lattice constants are a1 = 4.984
Å and a2 = 2.933 Å for AA-stacking
bilayer β12 borophene and a1 = 4.939 Å and a2 = 2.928
Å for AB-stacking bilayer β12 borophene. The
formation of these bilayer structures thus shorten the B–B
bonds across rows and retain those within rows, compared to those
in the free-standing monolayer sheet. Importantly, unlike the thermodynamic
instability observed in the vdW bilayer, there is no sign of imaginary
frequencies in the phonon dispersion as shown in Figure 2e,f, accordingly confirming
the thermodynamic stability of these novel bilayer borophene structures.
The highest optical phonon mode at Γ point for AA-stacking bilayer
β12 and AB-stacking bilayer β12 corresponds
to a B–B stretching mode with a frequency of 1126 and 1120
cm–1, respectively. As a comparison, that frequency
is 1147 cm–1 for monolayer β12 borophene.35

whereas the red solid lines are the fitting curves based on the Buckingham

The binding energy Eb is shown in Figure 2c,d as a function
of interlayer spacing, which is defined as62 1  Here, Emonolayer and Ebilayer(d) are
the total energy of free-standing monolayer and the corresponding
double layer with interlayer spacing d, respectively,
and S is the area of the supercell in AA- and AB-stacking
configurations. According to this definition, a larger absolute value
of Eb stands for a more stable stacking
configuration. The resulting interlayer spacing and binding energy
are 1.90 and 91.99 meV/Å2 for AA-stacking and 1.82
and 115.93 meV/Å2 for AB-stacking bilayer β12 sheets (Table S1), respectively,
indicating the presence of a strong interaction between the adjacent
β12 borophene sheets. On the basis of the DFT results,
the distance–energy curve can be described by the empirical
Buckingham potential63 2  

The fitting parameters A, B, C for Buckingham potential are shown
in Table S2.

Compared with the binding
energy of well-studied vdW-attracted
layered materials, for example, graphite (−16.84 meV/Å2), black phosphorene (−21.85 meV/Å2), and MoS2 (−26.99 meV/Å2),64 the binding energy in bilayer β12 borophene is remarkably higher, indicating that the interlayer interaction
in β12 borophene stack is primarily covalent attraction,
rather than a likely vdW-type interaction. Moreover, the absolute
value of the binding energy of AB-stacking bilayer β12 borophene is 23.94 meV/Å2 higher than that of the
AA-stacking counterpart. Thus, the AB-stacking β12 borophene is the most stable energetically. To distinct from the
usually discussed vdW layered structures, the covalently bonded bilayer
β12 borophene sheets are denoted as 2-β12-AA or 2-β12-AB sheets.

To further
understand the covalently bonded bilayer structures,
we calculated the electronic localization functions (ELFs). The results
are shown in Figure 2a,b. The values of ELF reflect the degree of charge localization,
with 1 representing the localization and 0 means a free electronic
state. It is clear that a significant amount of electrons are distributed
between B–B bonds along the z-axis, indicating
that covalent-like B–B bonds are formed between two β12 sheets.

As the 2-β12-AB sheet is
more stable energetically
than its AA stacking counterpart, in the following, we start from
it to explore the possible layered bulk boron. Figure 3a shows the top view and side view of the
layered bulk formed by the 2-β12-AB sheets via AA-stacking.
Only the AA-stacking is found to be stable, while obvious negative
frequency modes appear in phonon dispersion of AB-stacking counterparts
(not shown here). The lattice constants of the bulk structure obtained
from the DFT calculation are 4.95 Å in the x direction and 2.93 Å in the y direction. Figure 3c shows the phonon
dispersion relation of this structure. We find that the cutoff frequency
is 1117 cm–1, which is much lower than that of graphene
(1600 cm–1). Significantly, unlike the bulk structure
formed by monolayer β12 sheets via vdW interaction,
there is no negative frequency observed in the phonon dispersion,
demonstrating thermodynamic stability. Moreover, as shown in Figure 3b, the equilibrium
interlayer gap is around 3 Å, and interlayer binding energy is
about 20 meV/Å2, close to those of other vdW bulk
materials as shown in Table 1. Therefore, although the monolayer borophene sheet cannot
form a stable layered bulk via vdW interaction, the covalently bonded
bilayer β12 sheet is a promising candidate to realize
this purpose.

adopted from ref (64).

On the other side, the
2-β12-AA sheet can also
form a stable bulk layered structure via vdW interaction (AA-stacking),
as shown in Figure 4. In this structure, two planes of rectangular lattice form a plane
structure. The lattice constants are 4.998 Å in the x direction (the ridge direction), 2.937 Å in the y direction (the across-ridge direction), and 7.468 Å in the z direction. Figure 4b shows Eb as a function of interlayer
distance. The distance–energy points can be fitted to the empirical
Buckingham potential. By using DFPT, we obtained the IFC and hence
the phonon dispersion relation. Moreover, the optical phonon modes
along the x direction are generally more flat than
that along the y direction. This phenomenon reveals
that the bond strength is highly anisotropic. Compared to carbon,
boron lacks one electron. As a result, the bulk structure of boron
is complex, exhibiting up to 16 reported bulk allotropes, including
clusters and cages. Although several boride compounds such as MgB2 exhibit graphene-like boron layers,48 these layers are strongly bound with metal atoms, unlike the weakly
vdW-bonded sheets in graphite. Therefore, no naturally layered bulk
boron structures are reported. Our results demonstrate that covalently
bonded bilayer borophene is a possible building unit to form a stable
layered bulk boron allotrope.

The black squares represent the data obtained from DFT-D3 calculations,
whereas the red solid line is the fitting curve based on the Buckingham

Finally, we explore the electronic band structures of 2-β12-AA sheet, 2-β12-AB sheet, and the corresponding
layered bulk structures, as shown in Figure 5. Compared with the case of monolayer borophene,
the Fermi level crosses more bands because of the band splitting.
Therefore, the robust metallic feature is maintained. Moreover, because
of the anisotropic atomic structure, layered borophene is expected
to possess anisotropic electronic properties, and the electrical conductivity
is confined along the uncorrugated armchair direction. More importantly,
the vdW layered bulk structures also possess metallic behavior. The
unique metallic behavior may have remarkable impact for fundamental
research and technological application of borophene itself, and it
also holds significance in the context of vdW heterostructure design.
The fruitful development and applications of 2D materials have inspired
great interest in exploring their heterostructures, in which different
2D layers are stacked in a certain sequence via vdW interaction.65 Such vdW heterostructures have recently been
fabricated and display potential in several distinct applications
because many intriguing electronic, optical, and thermal properties
that are absent in individual 2D units.66−68 Graphene, MoS2, h-BN, and phosphorene were reported to be a building unit for vdW
heterostructures. However, no metallic unit was reported. Thus, the
stable vdW boron crystal and the preserved metallic characteristic
reported in the current work opens new route to expand the family
of 2D vdW heterostructures.

4 Summary
In this work, first-principles calculations
are employed to understand
the interface interaction, structural stability, and electronic band
structure of layered borophene sheets. We found that a strong interlayer
interaction occurs in the bilayer borophene sheets, forming a covalently
bonded bilayer structure. Compared to AA-stacking, the AB-stacking
is more stable in energy. We also explore the possible layered bulk
boron crystals and find that metallic nature is remarkably robust
against the weak vdW interlayer interaction. The vdW layered structures
of bulk boron are dynamically stable and promising for applications
ranging from nanoscale electronics devices to energy storage.
