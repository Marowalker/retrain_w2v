Creation
of an innovative composite photocatalyst, to advance its
performance, has attracted researchers to the field of photocatalysis.
In this article, a new photocatalyst based on polyaniline/reduced
graphene oxide (PANI/RGO) composites has been prepared via the in
situ oxidative polymerization method employing RGO as a template.
For thermoelectric applications, though a higher percentage (50 wt
%) of RGO has been used, for photocatalytic activity, lesser percentages
(2, 5, and 8 wt %) of RGO in the composite have given a significant
outcome. Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved
fluorescence spectra, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area analyses confirmed the improved photocatalytic mechanism. PANI/RGO
composites under visible light irradiation exhibit amazingly improved
activity toward the degradation of cationic and anionic dyes in comparison
with pristine PANI or RGO. Here, a PANI/RGO composite, with 5 wt %
RGO(PG2), has emerged as the best combination with the degradation
percentages of 99.68, 99.35, and 98.73 for malachite green, rhodamine
B, and congo red within 15, 30, and 40 min, respectively. Experimental
findings show that the introduction of RGO can relieve the agglomeration
of PANI nanoparticles and enhance the light absorption of the materials
due to an increased surface area. Moreover, the PG2 composite also
showed excellent photocatalytic activity to reduce noxious Cr(VI).
The effective removal of Cr(VI) up to 94.7% at pH 2 was observed within
only 15 min. With the help of the active species trapping experiment,
a plausible mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation has been
proposed. The heightened activity of the as-synthesized composite
compared to that of neat PANI or RGO was generally because of high
concentrations of •OH radicals and partly of •O2– and holes (h+) as concluded from the nitroblue tetrazolium probe test and photoluminescence
experiment. It is hoped that the exceptional photocatalytic performance
of our work makes the conducting polymer-based composite an effective
alternative in wastewater treatment for industrial applications.

1 Introduction
The
extensive use of various toxic elements by several manufacturing
companies (such as textile and paper printing industries, etc.) pollutes
water and affects the ecosystem.1−5 Decolorization of these dyes is an important process of wastewater
management before being discharged to the environment because of their
synthetic origin, complex chemical structure, toxicity, and carcinogenic
or explosive nature.6,7 To make use of the maximum of
the solar spectrum (43% of the visible light), new visible-light-sensitive
semiconductor photocatalysts are required for the degradation of toxic
dyes in wastewater management. Sunlight-driven photocatalysts such
as doped TiO2,8−108−10 CdS,11,12 CdSe,13 BiOBr,14 Cu2O,15 WO3,16 Fe2O3,1717 ZnO,18 and SnO219 are extensively
used nowadays.

It is interesting that the conducting polymer
polyaniline (PANI)
doped with different dopants has been broadly used as an adsorbent,18,20−26 being a p-type semiconductor. Other advantages of PANI are its high
hole transport ability, slow charge recombination rate in electron
transfer processes, fast charge carrier separation, and stability.18,23 PANI has been employed as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for
the degradation of cationic dyes such as rhodamine B (RhB),23 malachite green (MG),24 methylene blue (MB),26 and various anionic
dyes.18,23,25 The ease of
synthesis, environmentally friendly nature, and modulating properties
of PANI have made it an attractive candidate for degradation of organic
dyes. Due to these inherent advantages, more research should be carried
out to develop PANI-based composites for better photocatalytic materials.

Alternatively, graphene, owing to its high surface area and exclusive
optical, transport, mechanical, and electronic properties, has emerged
as a possible contender for other applications such as solar cells,27 sensors,28 hydrogen
generation,29 and catalytic activities.30−35 For visible light degradation of various cationic dyes30−34 and anionic dyes31 and for removal of
toxic Cr(VI) from aqueous solution,36,37 reduced graphene
oxide (RGO) and its composite photocatalysts have been used. Therefore,
a trend has come up for the synthesis of graphene or RGO-based nanocomposite
photocatalysts for the degradation of organic dyes in wastewater management.38−40 We have studied the competence of the PANI/RGO composite as a visible-light-induced
photocatalyst for the degradation of cationic MG and RhB dyes and
anionic congo red (CR) dye. Various works on heterostructures, combining
composite materials for enhanced photodegradation of various dyes,24,41−52 are presented in Table 1.

MG, a cationic dye, known to be heavily used in textile
and printing
industries, is toxic to human skin and eyes. RhB and CR have mutagenic
properties and hence noxious for living animals.

A composite
structure of PANI with RGO appears to be a potential
photocatalyst, owing to its capability (a) to absorb the entire portion
of the solar spectrum and (b) for photogenerated electron–hole pair separation. It could
also separate the excited charge carrier at a very fast rate to improve
the photocatalytic property.

Furthermore, the presence of poisonous
metallic elements (for example,
chromium) in the marine environment by discharges from industries,
such as leather tanning, electroplating, pigment, refractory, and
steel production industries,53 is a great
concern nowadays. Safe and efficient degradation of wastewater containing
deadly metallic elements is always a challenging job for industrialists
and environmentalists because of the fact that there are few cost-effective
treatment alternatives. The methods for the disposal of Cr(VI) comprise
ion exchange, reverse osmosis, evaporation, direct precipitation,
etc. Hence, the progress of cost-saving and less-energy-consuming
technology for the elimination of Cr(VI) is highly anticipated.

To the best of our knowledge, visible-light-induced photodegradation
by the PANI/RGO (PG) photocatalyst, for the degradation of MG dyes
is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, performance-wise,
this composite is the best, as given in Table 3 (Results and Discussion section), for degradation of anionic and cationic dyes. In this
study, we have shown visible-light-induced photocatalytic performances
of PG composites (2, 5, and 8% of RGO) that degrade MG, RhB, and CR
dyes within 15, 30, and 40 min with the degradation percentages of
99.68, 99.35, and 98.73, respectively. A plausible photocatalytic
mechanism is proposed, and the superior photocatalytic activity is
assigned to the electron–hole separation caused by the inclusion
of RGO in PANI. It has been observed that thermoelectric (TE) and
visible-light-dependent photocatalytic properties of the materials
crucially depend on the composition of the constituents PANI and RGO.
For TE applications, higher percentages of RGO have been used,54 and for photocatalytic activity, lesser percentages
of RGO in the composite have given the significant outcome.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
As-Prepared Photocatalysts
2.1.1 Morphological Characterizations
Figure 1A–F
shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of PANI, RGO, and the
PANI/RGO (PG2) composite, respectively. As shown in Figure 1A,D, pristine PANI is interconnected,
consisting of agglomerated nanoparticles. Figure 1B,E denotes a uniform, large, creased, and
veil-like layered structure of RGO sheets with an average thickness
of several hundred nanometers. It can be seen from Figure 1C,F that RGO is adorned with
well-distributed PANI nanoparticles for the PG2 composite, which is
beneficial for the photocatalytic activity. No individual PANI agglomerates
are observed, which implies that the nucleation and growth processes
occur only on the surface of the template RGO. Moreover, the tight
attachment between RGO and PANI can advance the performance and reproducibility
in photocatalytic degradation, discussed in the previous section.

2.1.2 Spectral Characterizations
Figure 2 depicts
XRD spectra
of the synthesized materials: (a) PANI, (b) RGO and (c) the PANI/RGO
(PG2) composite. Peaks at 20.54 and 25.28°, with hkl values (020) and (200), confirm the presence of PANI.55,56 A broad peak at around 25.44° and a tilt at 43.7° represent
the (002) and (100) crystalline planes of the graphite sheet.54,57 For the PG2 composite, peaks are found at around 20.62, 25.57, and
42.86°, respectively, as mentioned above, confirming that the
unit structure of PANI has been maintained even in the composite.54

Figure 3 represents
UV–vis spectra of the prepared PANI and PANI/RGO (PG2) composite.
Both the samples show a major peak at around 400 nm. With the addition
of RGO, the peak shifts toward the higher wavelength. The shoulder
below 400 nm signifies the π–π* transition of the
benzenoid rings. The peak around and above 400 nm is due to localized
polarons, indicating protonated PANI.58 At around 800 nm, the band, in continuation with the 400 nm peak,
indicates the extended coil conformation of PANI chains.59

Figure 3 UV–vis spectra of (a) PANI and (b) PG2 composite.

The inset of Figure 3 shows the optical band gaps
of the samples calculated from the UV–vis
spectra using the Tauc equation.60 A decrease
in the band gap is observed after the addition of RGO in the composite.
The band gaps of the samples are calculated as 2.95 and 2.74 eV for
PANI and PANI/RGO (PG2), respectively. Hence, the energy needed to
excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band is lower
in the PANI/RGO (PG2) composite than that for pure PANI.

X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum is mainly used
to study the chemical bonding, composition, and surface property of
a material. The survey spectrum (Figure 4a) confirms the presence of three binding
energy peaks at ∼284, ∼398, and ∼532 eV corresponding
to C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively. Figure 4b depicts the spectrum of carbon (C 1s) in
the composite having a binding energy of 284.5 eV, which is close
to that of pure PANI (283.9 eV) and RGO (284.2 eV for C–C bond).61 Oxygen (O 1s) spectrum (Figure 4c) of the composite with a binding energy
peak at ∼531.2 eV is due to the C–O or C-OH group in
carbon-based nanomaterials.62 In Figure 4d, the spectrum of
nitrogen (N 1s), at binding energy ∼399.6 eV, is assigned to
the presence of the quinoid amine (C=N bond) in the backbone
of PANI.24

2.2 Photocatalytic Activity
2.2.1 Photocatalytic
Degradation of Organic Dye
We have used a UV cutoff filter
to examine the visible-light-driven
photocatalytic activity of the samples for the degradation of cationic
dyes malachite green (MG), rhodamine B (RhB), and anionic dye congo
red (CR) as the probe molecules. In the case of MG, RhB, and CR, the
characteristic absorption peaks at 620, 553, and 496 nm, respectively,
were used to conduct the degradation study of the dyes. Relative concentrations
of MG, RhB, and CR dyes using the PANI/RGO composite and its constituent
(PANI and RGO) photocatalysts are shown in Figure 5A–C.

Figure 5 Plots of the concentration ratios of (A)
MG, (B) RhB, and (C) CR
in aqueous solutions against specific time intervals under various
conditions using the PANI/RGO (PG2) composite.

Rate constants (Kapp) have been
calculated
from the plots of ln(C0/Ct) versus irradiation time for MG, RhB, and CR, as shown
in Figure 6A–C,
respectively. Under visible light irradiation, among the three PANI/RGO
composites, PG2 with 5 wt % RGO has come out to be the best with the
degradation efficiencies of 99.68, 99.35, and 98.73% for MG, RhB,
and CR dyes within 15, 30, and 40 min, respectively.

Successive decreases of the absorption intensities of MG
at 620
nm, RhB at 553 nm, and CR at 496 nm with light exposure time are shown
in Figure 7A–C,
respectively, to explore the photocatalytic activities of the PANI/RGO
(PG2) composite. In the presence of pure PANI and RGO, under visible
light illumination, the degradation percentages of MG, RhB, and CR
dyes are about 61.07, 70.46, and 73.66% and 91.54, 89.45, and 86.07%,
respectively. The performance is found to be noticeably enhanced through
the presence of the PG2 composite for all of the dyes.

of photocatalytic degradation of MG, RhB, and CR dyes as a function
of irradiation time in the presence of the PG2 composite using different
scavengers are shown in Figure 8A–C, respectively. Visible-light-induced degradation
percentages with time and rate constant (Kapp) values of the various dyes using the prepared photocatalysts have
been tabulated in Table 2.

The superior activity of the PANI/RGO
architecture is explained
by the improvement of charge separation caused by the inclusion of
RGO in the PANI matrix. To approach the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic
activity of the PANI/RGO composite, the relative band positions of
both were studied.60,63 As depicted in Figure 10, while the PANI/RGO photocatalyst
is being irradiated in visible light, PANI gets excited and photoinduced
electrons and holes are generated. Electrons flow downhill from CB
of PANI to the Fermi level (FL) of RGO, leading to suppression in
the charge pair recombination process. According to the literature,
RGO has a higher reduction potential than O2/•O2– (+0.07 V).64 Electrons present at the surface of RGO can easily react with dissolved
O2 to produce a superoxide radical anion (•O2–), which in turn produces H2O2 in the presence of water. Photo-oxidation and photoreduction
of H2O2 occur with electrons and holes at the
catalyst surfaces, resulting in the formation of oxidant species •OH radicals, which degrade the dye molecules to colorless
products. Under visible light, dyes are excited to dye*. In the case
of MG, the LUMO level of MG complements well with VB of PANI.65 Therefore, photogenerated electrons are transferred
from the LUMO level of MG* to VB of PANI. As the HOMO level of MG
is situated lower than the oxidation potential of H2O/•OH (+2.32 V),66 H2O receives hole from the HOMO level of MG* to create •OH directly. In the case of RhB and CR dyes, the excited states RhB*
and CR* can inject electrons into the CB of PANI via an electron transfer
and these electrons, in turn, flow downhill to RGO, which is scavenged
by the O2 on the surface of the catalyst to form a superoxide
radical anion. Based on our experimental results and the discussions
above, the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of MG, RhB, and
CR dyes on the PANI/RGO catalyst has been proposed, as expressed in eqs 1–11.

Figure 10 Mechanism of the visible-light-driven charge transfer process of
the photogenerated electrons and holes in the PANI/RGO composite.

The proposed photocatalytic degradation
mechanism is given below:(a) For the photocatalysts, light absorption
causes the following reactions: 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  

(b) For
dyes, light absorption causes
the following reactions 9  

For MG 10a   10b  

For RhB
and CR 10c   10d   11  

The involvement of the active species of the visible-light-induced
photodegradation was confirmed with scavengers, such as tert-butanol (TBA), sodium oxalate (SO), K2S2O8, and p-benzoquinone (BQ) as •OH radical, hole (h+), electron (e–), and •O2– radical scavengers, respectively. As shown in Figure 8A–C, the addition of
scavengers induces an extent of inhibition in the photodegradation
of dyes, which is a clear signature of their roles in the degradation
process [degradation rate in decreasing order: •OH > e– > •O2– > h+].
These results
suggest that the photocatalytic degradation of dyes over the PANI/RGO
composite is dominated mostly by the •OH radical
oxidation process than the generated •O2– radicals and holes of the photocatalyst.

Two methods, including the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) probe technique67 and photoluminescence (PL-OH)68 experiment, were used to further confirm the presence of •O2– and •OH radicals on the photocatalyst surface. As observed
from Figure 11a, with
a longer irradiation time, the maximum absorption peak at 259 nm is
gradually decreased. This is due to the reaction between NBT and •O2– radicals.
This result fully supports the BQ quenching test (Figure 8) for the PG2 sample. The kinetic
plots of intensity versus irradiation time at 259 nm are shown in Figure 11b, which are well
fitted by the pseudo-first-order reaction equation for (i) PANI, (ii)
RGO, and (iii) PG2 samples, respectively. Figure 11c represents the PL emission peak at around
426 nm (excited at 312 nm). The formation of •OH
radical in the photocatalytic oxidation process is substantiated from
the gradual increase in the PL intensity with irradiation time. This is also compatible with
the result of the TBA quenching experiment (Figure 8). The PL intensity versus irradiation time
plots for all of the prepared materials shown in Figure 11d demonstrate the higher production
rate of •OH radicals for PG2 than that for pure
PANI or RGO. All of the results are in conformity with the scavenger
tests showing that the PG2 composite possesses more visible-light
photocatalytic activity than pristine PANI or RGO used in the degradation
of both types of dyes.

time at 259 nm, (c) •OH radical-trapping PL spectra
in solution of teraphthalic acid, and (d) PL intensity versus irradiation
time at 426 nm for the PG2 composite.

The durability of the catalyst is an important criterion
for its
repetitive use in environmental remediation. It was evaluated by the
photocatalytic degradation of MG, RhB, and CR for four cycles using
the same catalyst. The PANI/RGO (PG2) composite sample exhibited a
remarkably high photostability even after six cycles (99.68–86.63%
for MG), (99.35–87.12% for RhB), and (98.73–92.78% for
CR), as depicted in the photodegradation plots in Figure 12.

versus light exposure time for six
consecutive runs of the PG2 composite for (a) MG, (b) RhB, and (c)

2.2.3 Photocatalytic
Degradation of Toxic Metal
Cr(VI)
Apart from organic dye degradation, the as-synthesized
PANI/RGO (PG2) composite was found to have an active application in
the reduction of other water pollutants, e.g., Cr(VI). Figure 13A represents the efficient
removal of Cr(VI) up to 94.7% at pH 2 in only 15 min. The plot of
ln(C0/Ct)
vs irradiation time expresses a linear behavior, as shown in the inset
of Figure 13A. From
the slope of the linear plot, a high rate constant value of 1.932
× 10–1 min–1 has been computed.
In the presence of visible light, the photogenerated electrons on
the conduction band of PANI come to the FL of RGO, causing the effective
charge separation of the semiconductor. Due to this charge separation,
the available electrons can easily reduce Cr2O72– to Cr3+. At pH 2, photocatalytic
reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is described as follows  To monitor the effect of photogenerated
electrons
on the reduction of Cr(VI) for the RGO-incorporated PANI nanoparticles
(PG2), electron scavenger K2S2O8 is
added in the medium. As shown in the inset of Figure 13, the addition of K2S2O8 almost ceases the reduction reaction.69 H2O2 can take up holes from the VB
of PANI to convert •OOH to •OH
and to colorless degraded products. Figure 13B represents the reusability of photocatalytic
reduction of Cr(VI) for five cycles.

reduction of Cr(VI)

of (a) PG2 + K2S2O8, (b) PANI, and
(c) PG2. (B) Relative dye concentrations vs light exposure time for
five consecutive runs of the PG2 composite for photocatalytic reduction
of Cr(VI).

2.3 Photoluminescence
(PL) Property
In
the present study, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Figure 14 clearly demonstrate
the following: (i) a broad peak at 443 nm for neat PANI and the PANI/RGO
(PG2) composite, caused by the polaronic band of PANI,70 (ii) decreased emission in PG2 with respect
to that in pure PANI, revealing suppression of recombination of carriers.
Observation (ii) indicates that RGO serves as an electron acceptor
in the composite. These results are in conformity with the experimental
observations, that is, the enhanced rate constant (Kapp) and efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of MG,
RhB, and CR dyes under visible light irradiation using the PANI/RGO
(PG2) composite over pure PANI as a photocatalyst. Because of the
separation of photogenerated electrons and holes with higher lifetime,
the generation of highly oxidative photoreactive species like •O2– and •OH radicals is promoted in the photocatalytic reaction.
Thus, the PANI/RGO composite emerges to be a stronger photocatalyst
compared with pure PANI, as these photoreactive species sequentially
take part in the degradation processes.71,72

2.4 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
Surface Area and Pore Size Analyses
BET analysis has been
performed to measure the surface area and pore size of RGO and the
PANI/RGO (PG2) composite, as shown in Figure 15. It is the type IV isotherm (Figure 15a), which indicates
the mesoporous structure of the samples.73,74 The measured surface area of the PG2 composite is about 35.06 m2/g, which is almost 2 times larger compared to that of pristine
PANI (15.41 m2/g),75 as has
been observed for other systems such as hollow cobalt ferrite/polyaniline
nanofiber photocatalyst,76 PANI-bismuth
selenide photocatalyst,77 and multifunctional
polyacrylonitrile/ZnO/Ag electrospun nanofiber photocatalyst.78 The cumulative pore volume and differential
pore volume distributions with respect to the pore width of the RGO
and PG2 composite are shown in Figure 15b,c, respectively, using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
desorption data. For the PG2 composite, the higher pore volume is
observed compared with pure RGO, which is a signature of more porous
morphology.

volumes

2.5 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Decay Spectra
Nanosecond time-resolved emission spectra of the PANI/RGO (PG2)
composite showing faster decay compared with bare PANI or bare RGO
are presented in Supporting Figure S5.
Using a triexponential fitting process, average lifetimes of emission
decay for all of the materials are tabulated in Supporting Table T1. After decoration of RGO sheets into the
PANI matrix, the average
time of the PG2 composite decreases to 1.22 ns. The diminished fluorescence
lifetime value implies that the PANI/RGO composite can capture electrons,
facilitating the electron–hole pair separation.

2.6 Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectra
The presence
of PANI in the composite generates semiquinone radical
cations (polarons) as charge carriers, which are established from
the EPR spectra of the PANI/RGO composites for samples PG1, PG2, and
PG3 with a characteristic peak at g ∼2.004.79 There is an increase in peak intensity from
PG1 to PG2 followed by a decrease for PG3, as expected from photocatalytic
measurements where the material’s activity shows the same trend
[Supporting Figure S6].

3 Conclusions
PANI and the PANI/RGO composite with different
RGO contents have
been synthesized via the in situ oxidative polymerization technique.
These materials degrade MG, RhB, and CR very efficiently under visible
light. The synergistic effect between PANI and RGO (sheetlike structure)
in the composite improves visible-light catalytic activity compared
to that of PANI and RGO. PG2 (5 wt % RGO) showed the best photocatalytic
performance with higher rate constants compared to those of its constituents
PANI and RGO, which are ∼6.1 times and ∼2.3 times higher
for MG, ∼4.1 times and ∼2.2 times higher for RhB, and
∼3.3 times and ∼2.2 times higher for CR. For TE applications,
higher percentages of RGO have been used, and for photocatalytic activity,
lower percentages of RGO in the composite have given remarkable results.
The mechanism of photodegradation is discussed for the improvement
of visible light performance of the composite over PANI through the
active species trapping experiment. The composite also showed superior
photocatalytic activity toward the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
under visible light. The diminishing PL intensity and fluorescence
lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers are in tune with the improved
photodegradation of the dyes by PG2 over PANI. The enhanced activity
of the composite was mainly due to the higher production rate of •OH radicals than •O2– and holes (h+), as concluded
from the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) probe test and photoluminescence
(PL-OH) experiments.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Pure graphite powder (99%;
LOBA Chemie, India, crystalline, 60 mesh), aniline (Fisher Scientific,
India), deionized water (Hydrolab, India), 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA,
Merck), ammonium peroxy-di-sulfate (APS, Merck), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Merck), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, Merck),
sulfuric acid (H2SO4, Merck), ortho-phosphoric
acid (H3PO4, Merck), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Merck, 30% GR Pro analysis), calcium chloride
(CaCl2, Merck), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5, Merck), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4H2O, Merck) were used for the material synthesis. Malachite
green (MG), congo red (CR), and rhodamine B (RhB) dyes were purchased
from Himedia, India. Nitro B.T. AR (nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)) and
benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (teraphthalic acid (TA)) are procured
from LOBA Chemie, India.

4.2 Synthesis of PANI/RGO (PG)
Photocatalysts
Composites of PANI/RGO have been synthesized
employing the in situ
oxidative polymerization method, as described in our previous work;54 however, the percentages of compositions are
different in the present case. PG composites containing three different
weight percentages of reduced graphene oxide sheets have been denoted
PG1 (2% RGO), PG2 (5% RGO), and PG3 (8% RGO), respectively.

4.3 Evaluation of Photocatalytic Activity
To demonstrate
the potential application of neat PANI and RGO and
PANI/RGO (PG) composites for the degradation of organic contaminants,
we have examined their photocatalytic activities by choosing the photodegradation
(at pH = 7) of three model pollutant dyes: cationic malachite green
(MG), rhodamine B (RhB), and anionic congo red (CR). Furthermore,
the photoreduction of an aqueous solution of 10–5 M Cr(VI) has been studied. To understand the degradation mechanism,
the scavenger test and the reusability test were performed for the
PG composites. In a usual run of photocatalytic decomposition of MG,
RhB, and CR, 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of dye solution
(1.7 × 10–5 M) in a quartz beaker. Then, the
solution was magnetically stirred at ambient temperature and pressure
in the dark for 1 h to establish adsorption–desorption equilibrium
of MG, RhB, and CR molecules on the surface of the catalyst. The changes
in the absorbance intensity of the dyes were scrutinized. For visible
light, we have used a Phillips 200 W tungsten lamp (total optical
irradiance = 70 mW cm–2, the distance between the
irradiation source and the top surface of the dye in the container
= 10 cm), positioned vertically above the reaction vessel. A solution
of NaNO2 was used as a UV cutoff filter80 to guarantee complete removal of radiation below 420 nm
and to ensure that illumination of the photocatalyst system occurred
only by visible light wavelengths. After a specific time interval,
5 mL of dye solution was centrifugally collected and then the concentration
of the dye solution was investigated through measurement of change
in the absorbance using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The effectiveness
of photocatalytic degradation (η) was evaluated using the following
equation  where C0 and Ct are the concentrations of the dyes measured
at the time of light-on and after photoexposure to a particular interval
of time, respectively.
