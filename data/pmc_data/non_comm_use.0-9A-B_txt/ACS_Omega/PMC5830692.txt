Among plasmonic nanoparticles, surfactant-free
branched gold nanoparticles
have exhibited exceptional properties as a nanoplatform for a wide
variety of applications ranging from surface-enhanced Raman scattering
sensing and imaging applications to photothermal treatment and photoimmunotherapy
for cancer treatments. The effectiveness and reliability of branched
gold nanoparticles in biomedical applications strongly rely on the
consistency and reproducibility of physical, chemical, optical, and
therapeutic properties of nanoparticles, which are mainly governed
by their morphological features. Herein, we present an optimized bottom-up
synthesis that improves the reproducibility and homogeneity of the
gold-branched nanoparticles with desired morphological features and
optical properties. We identified that the order of reagent addition
is crucial for improved homogeneity of the branched nature of nanoparticles
that enable a high batch-to-batch reproducibility and reliability.
In addition, a different combination of the synthesis parameters,
in particular, additive halides and concentration ratios of reactive
Au to Ag and Au to Au seeds, which yield branched nanoparticle of
similar localized surface plasmon resonances but with distinguishable
changes in the dimensions of the branches, was realized. Overall,
our study introduces the design parameters for the purpose-tailored
manufacturing of surfactant-free gold nanostars in a reliable manner.

Introduction
Anisotropic nanoparticles
(NPs) have been investigated over many
years due to their unique morphology-dependent physical, chemical,
and optical properties.1−8 In particular, synthetic routes for the rational design and optimization
of bottom-up syntheses have received great interest as translational
applications in biology, medicine, and energy industry are expanding
exponentially.4,9−14 Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) that exhibit optical absorption in the
near-infrared (NIR) have gained notable attention for diagnostic and
therapeutic applications as biological tissues are optically transparent
in the NIR region, particularly, those that exhibit higher electromagnetic
field enhancement for enhanced optical imaging and those that exhibit
enhanced photon-to-heat conversion for effective photothermal therapies.15−19 Highly branched Au NPs are of particular interest among other anisotropic
nanoparticles, as they offer a wide range of optical tunability by
subtle changes in their geometry and a higher optical signal enhancement
due to the highly intense nanoantenna effect from the sharp features
of the branches.20−26

As it is common among anisotropic nanoparticle syntheses,
a variety
of synthetic approaches have been developed for branched nanoparticles
via surfactant-mediated or capping agent-guided methods,9,27,28 whereas very few surfactant-free
routes have been recently developed.14,23,29,30 Our group first introduced
a surfactant-free route that does not require toxic cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide for producing biocompatible nanoparticles with multiple sharp
branches protruding from a spherical core, which are referred to as
“gold nanostars” (GNS).23 The biocompatible surface chemistry that requires no ligand exchange
or extensive purification protocols, ease of direct surface functionalization,
and higher surface area available for molecular recognition or transporting
therapeutic/functional entities are major advantages offered by GNS
that have led to the versatility of their broad-ranging biological
and sensing applications.17,23,24 For instance, in combination with the excellent plasmonic properties,
intense surface-enhanced Raman scattering and two-photon luminescence,
GNS have provided an exceptional platform for in vitro and in vivo
diagnostics,31,32 stem cell tracking,33 bioimaging,34,35 photodynamic
and photothermal tumor treatments,36,37 and immunotherapy.38

As surfactant- and capping-agent-free
synthesis of GNS offers many
advantages, a more mechanistic understanding of the modulation of
the morphological features of GNS is yet to be explored. This is of
utmost importance, as the effectiveness and reliability of GNS in
biomedical applications rely strongly on the consistency and reproducibility
of physical, chemical, optical, and therapeutic properties of GNS,
which are mainly governed by the morphological features of branches
and the homogeneity of the nanoparticles.

The original protocol
of seed-mediated, surfactant- and capping-agent-free
GNS synthesis (first generation GNS) introduced by Vo-Dinh group yields
individual nanoparticles with significant morphological inhomogeneity
and broad absorbance spectra.23 The original
protocol involves simultaneous addition of AgNO3 and ascorbic
acid (AA) to an acidic mixture of polycrystalline spherical Au NPs
(d = 12 nm gold seeds) and gold chloride.23 The reaction kinetic for the formation of branched
nanoparticles by this method is fast, completing in less than 5 s,
and results in a 100% yield of GNS with a highly three-dimensional
(3-D) nature in which multiple branches protrude from a spherical
core in multiple planes. Although this synthetic method results in
no to negligible byproducts, a careful analysis of the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs reveal a significantly high
variation in the morphological features of the branches that results
in the overall size inhomogeneity, which, in turn, leads to broad
absorbance spectra.23 This ultimately affects
the reproducibility, effectiveness, and reliability of the biomedical
applications of GNS. For instance, a significant variation in the
average surface areas of the nanoparticles affects the loading of
therapeutic molecules or bioactive molecules for therapy applications.

In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation to identify
the critical synthesis parameters that determine the homogeneity of
the geometric features of branched nanoparticles and modulate the
morphology, particularly the branch density and dimensions to obtain
the desired optical properties. The investigation presents the design
rules to optimize the bottom-up synthesis, and hence, improve the
reproducibility and homogeneity of the surfactant-free GNS.

Results
and Discussion
Addition of Shape-Directing Agent, Ag+, before Reducing
Agent, Ascorbic Acid, Improves the Homogeneity of Branched Gold Nanoparticles
The underpotential deposition of Ag atoms on the defect sites of
polycrystalline spherical Au NPs has been suggested as the underlying
mechanism for the overgrowth of protrusion from spherical Au seeds
leading to branched structures.39 Based
on that growth mechanism, we identified that simultaneous addition
of AgNO3 and AA should not be necessary, but doing so might
instead generate different subpopulations of nucleation sites in the
same growth solution leading to a higher degree of variation in the
overall morphology.

Therefore, the original synthesis protocol
was revised such that the AgNO3 is added to the growth
solution (a mixture of Au NP seeds and an acidic gold chloride solution),
let the solution mix for ∼5 s to create a homogeneous reaction
mixture and then introduce AA. Although this did not produce any significant
changes in the reaction rates or color in the colloidal solution,
a significant improvement in the quality of absorption spectra and
morphology of GNS was observed (Figure 1a–d). The TEM image analysis of GNS showed a
narrow size distribution, i.e., a significantly improved homogeneity
in the size distribution for the spherical core diameter as well as
the average tip-to-tip distance (Figures 1b and S1). This
could also explain the improved features observed in the absorbance
spectra of GNS. In general, for the new (second) generation of GNS,
(i) the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks are noticeably
more symmetric and (ii) the full width at half-maxima (fwhm) of the
plasmon peaks occur in the NIR region are significantly narrower at
any given LSPR maxima in comparison to that of the GNS synthesized
from the original protocol.23 These properties
are important indications of significant improvements in the quality
of nanoparticles, i.e., better homogeneity in size/morphology distribution.
GNS now display improved morphological features as evident in their
well-defined branches with narrower tip curvatures (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Order of reagent addition
affects the homogeneity of surfactant-free
GNS synthesis. The addition of shape-directing AgNO3 followed
by the reducing agent, ascorbic acid, ensures improved homogeneity
and reproducibility of surfactant- and capping-agent-free GNS. (a)

batch of second generation GNS synthesized using the modified protocol
and that exhibit optical absorption at ∼650 nm. (d) High reproducibility
and repeatability of the GNS synthesized using the modified protocol
is represented by the absorption spectra with similar LSPR peak maxima
(649 ± 4 nm) and fwhm (136 nm) of similar representative batches
of GNS synthesized in different days by different personnel. (e) High-angle

STEM) image and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) map of

GNS. Scale bars: 50 nm.

The batch-to-batch reproducibility and repeatability of the
optical
response of GNS are also improved with the modified protocol (Figures 1 and S2). Figure 1c shows very high reproducibility and repeatability
of the LSPR peak position (649 ± 4 nm) and fwhm of the absorption
spectra of GNS synthesized by different laboratory members on different
days. Less prominent spherical core and the more branched nature of
the second generation GNS contribute to the negligible short band/shoulder
∼520 nm in comparison to the first generation GNS from the
original protocol. The sequential addition of AgNO3 and
AA also improved the monodispersity of the GNS colloidal suspension,
which is reflected by the narrower fwhm (on average ∼136 nm)
of the main LSPR peak (∼650 nm) in the NIR region, in comparison
to the fwhm ∼200 nm in a comparative first generation GNS.23 The high-resolution TEM images and the EDX maps
show that the presence of Ag (7 wt %) and Au (93 wt %) in single surfactant-free
GNS (Figures 1e and S3) and the growth of branches along the {11̅1}
lattice planes (Figure 1f).

In addition to the main LSPR mode in NIR (mode 1, λ1), second generation GNS show a higher-order plasmon mode
(mode 2,
λ2) at higher wavelengths (Figure 2). These higher-order plasmon modes were
not observable in the absorbance spectra of first generation GNS,
which could be due to the high polydispersity of GNS colloidal suspensions.
GNS with multiple plasmon modes in the NIR region has also been observed
in branched NPs synthesized by other synthetic approaches.14,30 These higher-order LSPR modes (λ2) become more
prominent and also red-shift as the GNS becomes larger in size with
long branches and higher branch densities (Figures 3, S4 and S5).
However, it should be noted that only the first LSPR mode (mode 1,
λ1) was considered for the study reported in this
article. We expect that an in-depth understanding of the higher-order
plasmon modes could provide valuable information on the plasmonic
properties of GNS, however, that is beyond the scope of this study.

study) and λ2 denotes the a higher-order plasmon

The currently accepted mechanism for the seed-mediated formation
of branched nanoparticles proposes that the underpotential deposition
of Ag atoms on the defect sites of polycrystalline spherical Au NPs
catalyzes and promotes the growth of protrusions, whereas reduced
Au atoms contribute to the extension of protrusion and the growth
of the Au core.9,40,41 This mechanism suggests two important factors that could determine
the branch density of nanoparticles, (1) the number of surface exposed
defect sites on Au seeds and (2) the amount of reactive Ag+ available in the growth solution. To deconvolute the individual
contributions of the defect sites and the Ag+ content,
two sets of experiments were carried out, where (1) the size of the
polycrystalline Au NPs seeds and (2) the amount of reactive Ag+ in the growth solution were varied independently while keeping
the other reaction conditions unchanged.

Effect of the Size and
the Amount of Au Seeds on Branch Density
and Optical Tunability of Nanoparticles
There are fundamental
studies showing that the number of surface defect sites depends on
the size of the polycrystalline nanoparticles.42,43 In this study, we compared the morphological features of GNS originated
from 12 nm (used in the original recipe) and 5 nm diameter Au seeds
with no other changes made in the synthesis.

The optical absorption
or the LSPR maxima tunability can be achieved in the visible to NIR
region regardless of the size of the Au seeds (Figure 2c). In general, branched nanoparticles of
similar LSPR maxima can be obtained from the Au seeds of varying diameters,
which was evident by GNS synthesized using d = 5
and 12 nm Au seeds in this study. Regardless of the size of the Au
seeds, three general trends in the morphology of GNS were observed
as the number of Au seeds to moles of Au3+ available in
the growth solution increases: (i) the branch lengths and the branch
aspect ratio, i.e., the branch length to width, decreases, (ii) the
size of the Au core decreases, which collectively leads to a decrease
in the overall size of the branched nanoparticles (Table 1, Figures S5 and S6), and (iii) an overall decrease in the branch density
of GNS (as visible in the two-dimensional (2-D) plane from the TEM
micrographs) is observed with increasing Au seeds-to-Au3+ concentration ratio. These observations could be attributed to the
limited Au3+ available in the growth solution for the growth
of core and protrusions as the amount of seeds increases. This also
explains the presence of nanoparticles with incomplete growth of protrusions
or GNS bearing much shorter and wider protrusions (less prominent
branched nature) at elevated seed concentrations that exhibit optical
absorbance <650 nm. It should also be noted that a general trend
of peak broadening was observed with the red-shift in the LSPR peak
position. This could be attributed to the morphological heterogeneity
that GNS acquire, as it gets larger in size with multiple branches.
In addition to morphological changes, three prominent trends in the
optical absorption of GNS (originate from both d =
5 and 12 nm Au seeds) were observed when the number of Au seeds to
amount (moles) of Au3+ available in the growth solution
decreases: (i) the main LSPR mode in the NIR red-shifts, (ii) the
peak symmetry gradually decreases, and (iii) fwhm of the main LSPR
mode increases. This could be attributed to the morphological anisotropy
that originates from the increase in branch densities and the branch
lengths in GNS that posses LSPR modes at wavelengths approximately
above 750 nm in comparison to GNS with the main LSPR modes at wavelengths
below 750 nm.

For further examination, GNS obtained from d =
12 and 5 nm Au seeds that exhibit similar LSPR peak position were
compared for any relationship between the branch characteristics and
the size of the Au seeds. Analysis of the TEM micrographs of four
pairs of nanoparticles from 12 to 5 nm Au seeds that exhibit LSPR
maximum ∼650, 700, 750, and 800 nm was carried out (Figure 3). Table 1 provides the approximated branch
dimensions by analyzing the TEM micrographs of GNS. It should be noted
that the provided values are considered underestimations, as it is
challenging to obtain more accurate estimations from of these nanoparticles
of highly 3-D nature from the 2-D projections from the TEM images
(Figure S1). Based on the TEM analysis,
two significant differences between GNS synthesized using 5 and 12
nm Au seeds were observed. (i) The size of particles, both core and
tip-to-tip diameter, is smaller for GNS synthesized from 5 nm Au seeds
at any given LSPR maximum considered in this study (Table 1). (ii) The branches are relatively
long for GNS synthesized using 5 nm Au seeds. The latter fact could
contribute to more morphological heterogeneity in individual GNS,
which collectively could be attributed to less symmetric and larger
fwhm of LSPR absorbance peaks observed in GNS synthesized from d = 5 nm Au seeds than in that from d =
12 nm seeds (Figures 2 and 3).

Surprisingly, no significant
difference in the branch density was
observed among the set of nanoparticles and LSPR peak regions considered.
Therefore, it is concluded that at least under the physical parameters
we studied, the size of the Au seeds do not make a noticeable contribution
to the tuning of the branched nature of particles.

Amount of Reactive
Au3+/Ag+ Determines
the Branch Density and Dimensions of Nanoparticles
The contribution
of Ag on the anisotropic growth of nanoparticles has been reported
in literature.40,41,44Figure 4 shows that
as the Au+-to-Ag+ molar ratio is changed, a
significant change in the branched morphological features is observed.
The branch density is increased on average from 3 to 10 as the available
Ag+ content is increased by 8 times. In addition, the average
branch length is increased, leading to an increased overall size of
the particle, as defined by the average tip-to-tip distance. Based
on the catalytic Ag theory, we hypothesized that more defect sites
on the polycrystalline seeds are activated and catalyzed by the Ag
deposition with increasing Ag+ content, and having more
activated surface sites on Au seeds leads to the growth of more protrusions
during the growth process, hence a higher branch density. The distribution
of Au3+ among an increasing number of branches leads to
relatively shorter branches in comparison to longer branches as observed
in nanoparticles with lower branch density. Table 1 summarizes the dimensions for various morphological
features of GNS synthesized under varying Au3+-to-Ag+ molar ratios.

pH and Additive Halides Play an Important
Role in the Formation
of Branched Nanoparticles
Halides have been demonstrated
to affect the anisotropic growth of surfactant-mediated Au and Ag
NPs.1,27,44−46 There are few fundamental studies that have demonstrated the Au–halide
chemical affinities and halide-concentration-dependent morphological
and spectral tuning of Au NPs in different contexts.47 Our method for the surfactant-free, seed-mediated growth
of GNS uses HCl to adjust the pH of the growth solution, which introduces
2 mM final concentration of chloride (Cl–) into
the growth solution. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have
been reported to understand the influence of halides on the surfactant-free/capping
agent-free synthesis of anisotropic nanoparticles. Therefore, we conducted
a systematic investigation of the effect of Cl–,
bromide (Br–), and iodide (I–)
on the growth mechanism of the surfactant-free GNS, in terms of the
GNS overall size, branch characteristics, homogeneity of particles,
and optical properties.

Neither pH nor Cl– alone is critical for the growth of surfactant-free GNS, but together
they affect the subtle modulations in the shape and optical properties
of GNS. We conducted the syntheses in which (a) pH was adjusted to
3 using a non-halide-containing inorganic acid, nitric acid (absence
of Cl–), and (b) no pH adjustment was made, but
the same amount of Cl– was introduced to the growth
solution as NaCl (pH of the growth medium is 6). The resultant GNS
were compared to that from the original growth conditions, where the
pH is 3 and Cl– is present. Both these conditions
resulted in the GNS whose morphology and optical response were similar
to those from the original protocol (pH 3, 2 mM Cl–), indicating that the presence of Cl– is not necessary
or critical for the shape evolution of GNS (Figures 5 and S3). Changing
the pH of the growth solution from 3 to 6, however, resulted in significant
differences in the optical response and also a few noticeable changes
in the morphology. In particular, growth media at less acidic pH (pH
6) resulted in GNS that reflected less defined, relatively shorter
branches (Figure 5a,c).
Growth media at basic pHs have also reported to result in GNS that
are more spherical in shape with less defined branches.29 The pH of the growth solution is important for
the equilibrium concentration of AuCl4–, and the acidic pHs employed in this study is considered adequate
to drive the equilibrium reaction to yield all of the reactive Au3+. However, the LSPR maxima and the overall size of the GNS
were smaller for the syntheses carried out at pH 6 compared to that
of the GNS for the syntheses at pH 3 (Figure 5a,c). This can be attributed to the reduction
of Au3+ to Au(0) to a lesser extent at pH 6 compared to
that at pH 3, ultimately affecting the growth of GNS in size (both
core and branch extension in size) and hence the blue-shifted LSPR
maxima. To estimate the reduction yield of Au3+ at each
pH, we compared the absorbance ∼295 nm, which is the characteristic
absorbance band for AuCl4– for the as-synthesized
GNS.48 Based on the absorbance values at
295 nm for a representative GNS obtained at pH 3 (A = 0.584) and pH 6 (A = 0.624), we estimated that
the reduction of AuCl4– probably takes
place to a lesser extent at pH 6 than at pH 3 (Figure S7). This could be attributed mainly due to the reducing
power of ascorbic acid (higher reducing power at pHs lower than the
pKa of ascorbic acid and vice versa) being
affected by the pH of the growth solution.49 It could affect the complete reduction of Au3+ but not
the Ag+ ions present in the growth solution. As a result,
the complete nucleation of Ag+ and incomplete reduction
of Au3+ could dominate at pH 6, which, in turn, affect
the growth of GNS, resulting particles that are relatively smaller
in size compared to those from the GNS obtained at pH 3. In addition,
it is also reported that as the pH increases, the equilibrium concentration
of AuCl4– decreases due to the formation
of gold hydroxyl complexes.50 This could
also reduce the available amount of Au3+ for the GNS growth
at pH 6. Therefore, the collective influence of the above-discussed
pH-dependent changes in the growth solution could yield GNS that are
relatively smaller in size at pH 6. Therefore, based on our results,
an acidic growth solution is more favorable for the complete growth
of surfactant-free GNS. The fact that the morphology evolution of
GNS is not significantly impacted by pH is advantageous for an effective
subsequent pH-sensitive postsynthesis modifications such as functionalization
with oligonucleotides or silica/silver shell formation.

Figure 5 Additive halides
and pH of the growth solution affect the morphological
characteristics of branches and the optical response of GNS. The change

NaCl and (b) NaBr in the GNS growth solution at pH 3 and 6. Representative
TEM micrographs of branched nanoparticles synthesized at 1 mM (highest)
and 10 μM (lowest) final concentrations of (c) NaCl and (d)
NaBr in the growth solution at pH 3 and 6. Scale bars: 50 nm.

However, subtle modulation of
the optical absorbance of GNS in
a narrow wavelength range was observed as the final concentration
of Cl– in the growth solution changes. As shown
in the TEM micrographs, an increase in the branch density is noticeable
as the [Cl–] in the growth solution decreases, and
this effect is more prominent in the growth solutions at pH 3 (Figure 5c). Though Cl– is not a critical experimental factor that contributes
to the origin of branches, we have demonstrated that Cl– can be used to fine-tune the morphological features, and thereby
modulate the LSPR peak maxima of the surfactant-free GNS in a narrow
range of wavelengths. It is noteworthy that the morphological and
optical tuning of GNS mediated by Cl– is not significant
and effective as that by Au seeds and AgNO3. But the presence
of Cl– in the growth solution should be taken into
consideration as an important experimental factor to ensure reproducible
optical and morphological properties of GNS.

Addition of Br– significantly affects the shape
evolution of branched nanoparticles, and this effect is both pH- and
concentration-dependent. In the presence of Br–,
at the same concentration and pH as in the original protocol (pH 3,
2 mM), the resultant GNS exhibit truncated branches with more prominent
spherical core, whereas GNS synthesized at pH 6, 2 mM Br– exhibit only a very few, broad protrusions (Figure 5d). However, longer and narrower branches
with higher density, even comparable to the original GNS, can be observed
from the growth solutions containing nanomolar concentrations of Br– at pH 3 and to a lesser degree at pH 6. In addition,
it should be noted that in the presence of Br– at
all of the concentrations and pHs investigated in this study, the
batch-to-batch reproducibility of LSPR peak position is not as consistent
as it is in the presence of Cl– (Figures 5b and S7). The shape evolution and morphology tuning trends in the
presence of Br– could be explained by chemisorption
of Br– on the crystallographic facets of the Au
seeds with higher Au–Br– affinity than Au–Cl–,51 which elevates the reduction
potential of Au and Ag for the emergence of protrusions and their
growth.

The presence of I–, even in nanomolar
concentration,
causes drastic morphological and optical changes in the surfactant-free
GNS synthesis. At the various I– concentrations
(10 nM to 100 μM) investigated in this study, the growth of
branches is completely diminished, resulting spherical nanoparticles
that exhibit optical absorption in the visible region with a broader
fwhm (Figure S8). This could be attributed
to the chemisorption of I– with high affinity to
Au (the highest among halides)52 that increases
the reduction potential of Au and passivates the crystallographic
facets of polycrystalline Au seeds, which, in turn, suppress the emergence
of protrusions from the Au seeds.27,45,46

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
identified several experimental parameters
that determine the geometrical features of branches, which, in turn,
affect the overall morphology, optical response, and, most importantly,
the batch-to-batch reproducibility. This latter feature is essential
for the reliable performances of surfactant-free GNS-based applications.
We have demonstrated that the addition of shape-directing AgNO3 followed by ascorbic acid addition ensures improved homogeneity
and high reproducibility of surfactant-free GNS synthesis. The LSPR
peak position tuning was demonstrated to be achievable by changing
the relative concentration of Au seeds, reactive Ag+, and
also by tuning the chemical affinities of Au–halide. Branch
characteristics of GNS were found to depend strongly on the reactive
Ag content, whereas the shape evolution of branched nanoparticles
was sensitive to the presence of halides. These synthetic design rules
provide multiple routes for manufacturing GNS that exhibit a specifically
desired optical response and have varying morphological characteristics,
using a simple surfactant-free approach. Finally, the findings of
this study lay the foundation for predetermining and synthesizing
the best-performing GNS for an application of interest.

Materials and
Methods
Chemicals and Materials
Gold chloride solution, silver
nitrate (AgNO3), l-ascorbic acid (AA), sodium
bromide (NaBr), sodium chloride (NaCl), and sodium iodide (NaI) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 1 M) and 1 M
nitric acid (HNO3) were purchased from VWR. Citrated capped
gold colloid solution (5 nm diameter, concentration = 5 × 1013 particles/mL) was purchased from BBI Solutions (Figure S9) and thiol-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-COOH
MW 5000 from Nanocs Inc. All of the syntheses were performed in 20
mL polyethylene scintillation vials (VWR) using Ultrapure Millipore
Milli-Q water. Magnetic stir bars and all of the the glassware used
in Au NP syntheses were cleaned by aqua regia before use. Citrate
capped 12 nm diameter Au NPs seeds (concentration = 1.5 × 1011 particles/mL) for GNS synthesis were synthesized according
to a modified version of the Turkevish method (Figure S9).53

Surfactant-
and Capping-Agent-Free GNS Synthesis
The
GNS synthesis was carried out using a modified version of surfactant-free
GNS synthesis described by Vo-Dinh et al.23 492 μL of gold chloride solution (5.08 mM) was added to 10
mL of Milli-Q water and mixed under magnetic stirring for 1 min. 20
μL of 1 M HCl was then added and 5 μL of 12 nm diameter
Au seeds (concentration = 1.5 × 1011 particles/mL)
30 s later. After 5 s, 34 μL of 3 mM AgNO3, followed
by 100 μL 100 mM AA, was added with a 5 s delay between them,
and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 s under moderate stirring
conditions. Formation of GNS begins immediately after the addition
of AgNO3, which is observable by the color change from
colorless to bluish-green to purple (depending on the AgNO3 and seed amounts). The resulted GNS were immediately purified by
centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min, and the resulted
pellet was resuspended in about 1 mL of Milli-Q water. The purified
GNS were either functionalized with ligands of interested or stabilized
with thiol-PEG-COOH and stored at 4 °C until further use. For
stabilization of as-purified GNS by PEGylation, 10 μL of 1 mg/mL
aqueous solution of thiol-PEG-COOH was added to 1 mL of purified GNS
and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, PEGylated-GNS was
purified by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min and
the resulted pellet was resuspended in about 1 mL of Milli-Q water
and stored at 4 °C covered in aluminum foil. These functionalized
GNS were used for further experimentation within 2 weeks, as GNS exhibited
better optical and morphological stability within that time (Figure S10). The same protocol was used to synthesize
GNS using 5 nm diameter Au seeds (concentration = 5 × 1013 particles/mL).

Changing Halide Concentration and pH
GNS were synthesized
by varying halide concentration in the growth solution between 10
nM and 1 mM by adding 10 μL of the relevant stock solutions
(10 μM to 1 M) of NaCl, NaBr, and NaI. The pH of the growth
solution was adjusted to pH 3 by adding 20 μL of 1 M HNO3, whereas pH 6 was obtained by not adding acids to the growth
solution.

Characterization
The absorbance spectra of the purified
GNS (both PEGylated and bare) suspended in Milli-Q water were recorded
using a multimode microplate reader, FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech),
and a UV-3600 (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer. The morphology and the
particle size distribution of Au NPs were evaluated by using FEI Tecnai
G2 Twin transmission electron microscope, and HAADF STEM
images and EDX maps were acquired using FEI Titan 80-300. Hydrodynamic
particle size distribution and nanoparticle concentration were measured
by nanoparticle-tracking analysis using a NanoSight NS500 instrument
(Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.).

Determination of the Dimensions
of GNS
Dimensions of
GNS were determined using a marker-controlled watershed segmentation
algorithm on MATLAB (Supporting Information). This process involves segmenting the TEM images into foreground
objects (nanoparticles) and background. Segmentation is carried out
in a two-step process by first performing a distance transform on
the image and subsequently applying a watershed transform on the resulting
image. Briefly, these two functions separate the foreground objects
by quantifying the pixel intensity differences between different particles
and the overall background. This watershed transform is function that
turns an image into a surface where low-intensity pixels can be thought
of as troughs or catchment basins and high-intensity pixels are the
ridges that separate these basins. The process effectively separates
objects from each other and forms the background. Afterward, another
function is defined to quantify the pixel lengths of each detected
particle’s estimated perimeter. The pixel values are subsequently
converted to real lengths by using a calibration from a scale bar
in the same image. The core diameter was estimated as the equivalent
diameter of a circle with the same area as the particle. The tip-to-tip
length was estimated using an algorithm that finds the maximum distance
of any two points on the particle’s perimeter.
