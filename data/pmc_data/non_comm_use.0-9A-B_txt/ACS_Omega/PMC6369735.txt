Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) catalyze disulfide bond formation
between protein cysteine residues during protein folding in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) lumen and are essential for maintaining ER homoeostasis.
The life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely associated
with the ER. Synthesis and maturation of HCV proteins occur in the
ER membrane and are mediated by multiple host cell factors that include
also PDI. Here, we present a study investigating the effect of PDI
inhibition on Huh7 human hepatoma cells harboring an HCV subgenomic
replicon using the abscisic acid-derived PDI inhibitor origamicin.
Transcriptional profiling shows that origamicin changed the expression
levels of genes involved in the oxidative and ER stress responses
and the unfolded protein response, as indicated by the upregulation
of antioxidant enzymes and chaperone proteins, the downregulation
of cell-cycle proteins, and induction of apoptosis-associated genes.
Our data suggest that origamicin negatively impacts HCV replication
by causing an imbalance in cellular homoeostasis and induction of
stress responses. These insights suggest that inhibition of PDIs by
low-molecular-weight inhibitors could be a promising approach to the
discovery of novel antiviral compounds.

==== Body
Introduction
A cell is a spatially limited environment of tightly regulated
biological processes that ensure cell viability under varying external
conditions. Cells respond to stress conditions by activating various
counter measures, a prominent example being the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress response.1,2 The ER plays a key role in the
proteosynthesis and folding of secretory and transmembrane proteins.3 Perturbation of ER homeostasis impairs these
processes and leads to accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins
in the ER lumen,1,2 triggering the unfolded protein
response (UPR), which includes the upregulation of molecular chaperones
and the protein degradation machinery.4 Another well-known example of a cellular stress condition is oxidative
stress, which usually results from the increased concentration of
reactive oxygen species (ROS).5,6 Examples of ROS are
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid
(HOCl), or superoxide anion (O2–). ROS cause oxidative
stress by oxidatively modifying proteins, impair their function, and
induce protein unfolding and aggregation.5,7,8 ROS also play an important role in several
physiological processes provided their location and activity are within
a narrow range and the overall cellular redox homeostasis is not disrupted.9 For instance, hydrogen peroxide can act as a
regulator of cell proliferation, signal transduction, apoptosis, and
is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins.6,9−11

The protein disulfide bond formation in the ER is mediated by sequential
action of oxidoreduction 1 (Ero1α and Ero1β) and protein
disulfide isomerase (PDI).11−13 The cascade is initiated by catalytic
transfer of electrons from molecular oxygen to two cysteines in Ero1
that form a disulfide bond.14,15 The oxidized Ero1 interacts
with PDI and catalyzes formation of a disulfide bond in PDI while
being reduced. Finally, oxidized PDI is primed to catalyze the oxidation
of a cysteine pair in a client protein, creating either a de novo
disulfide bond or rearranging a pre-existing one.16

Although neither the X-ray nor the nuclear magnetic resonance structure
of full-length human PDI has been determined, structural information
derived from crystal structures of PDI fragments and PDI functional
homologs has been obtained and suggests that PDI has a horseshoe shape
consisting of four thioredoxin domains and a linker region termed x.17,18 These structural domains are
arranged in the order a, b, b′, x, and a′ thereby creating the
overall architecture of PDI. Both the a and a′ thioredoxin domains have an active site that include a pair of cysteines
within a −CXXC– motif. The b and b′ domains, however, lack catalytic activity. The linker
connecting the domains b′ and a′ provides structural flexibility and modulates access to substrate
proteins.19,20 The catalytically active cysteine pairs
present in the a and a′ domains represent
the molecular basis of PDI’s redox activity.21 Notably, PDI also possesses an additional chaperone activity.22 Apparently, this chaperone activity functions
independently of the redox activity;23 however,
recent experiments cast doubt on this assumption.24 The chaperone activity of PDI plays a role in protein folding
and acts to avoid protein misfolding and protein aggregation.25 The PDI chaperone function is important for
cell survival under conditions of elevated temperature or oxidative
stress. In summary, PDI plays a crucial role in oxidative protein
folding and ER homeostasis because of its dual role as an oxidoreductase
and molecular chaperone.

In this study, we investigated how PDI inhibition affects replication
of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the hepacivirus genus.26 The positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome
of HCV encodes three virion structural proteins E1, E2, and core protein,
as well as the nonstructural proteins p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and
NS5A.27 The virus predominantly infects
hepatocytes where it causes substantial rearrangement of the ER membrane
architecture and induces formation of the “membranous web”.28 The altered ER membrane serves as the locations
of viral replication and virion assembly.29 HCV is translated on the ER into a polyprotein that undergoes processing
by host and viral proteins including proteases, kinases, and PDIs.30,31 These host–virus interactions represent potential targets
for antiviral drug discovery.

Previously, we demonstrated that origamicin, an abscisic acid (ABA)-derived
inhibitor binding to human PDIs, has an inhibitory effect on HCV replication,
but the underlying mechanism of the inhibition is not well understood.32 Here, we investigated the effects of origamicin
on cellular metabolism by conducting Affymetrix microarray mRNA profiling,
and found that origamicin induces expression of proteins linked to
ER and oxidative stress response. These findings suggest that PDI
inhibition leads to an imbalance in cellular homeostasis and to induction
of stress responses that negatively affect HCV replication.

Results
Study Design
The PDI inhibitor origamicin is derived
from the plant hormone ABA (Figure 1A, top),32 but its effect
on the physiology of human hepatocytes is largely unknown. The chemical
modifications of ABA that create origamicin comprise a methyl esterification
of the acid, a chlorination of the methyl group on the third position
of the cyclohexenone ring, and an R-alkyne handle on the fifth position
of the cyclohexenone ring (Figure 1A, bottom), allowing bio-orthogonal labeling.33 We investigated the effect of origamicin treatment
on global mRNA levels by using a hepatocyte cell line (Huh7) harboring
the HCV subgenomic replicon pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1 (Figure 1B). This replicon
system, termed E9 cells, is widely used to study the replication of
HCV in a cell culture model.34 We treated
the replicon cells with two concentrations of origamicin (i.e., mock,
25 and 50 μM) for 24 h. To confirm that PDI inhibition impairs
HCV replication in our model system, we also tested the effect of
two well-described PDI inhibitors, 16F16 and securinine35 (Supporting Information, Figure S1), which showed similar antiviral activity, further supporting
a role for PDI in the viral life cycle. After the treatment, we extracted
the total RNA and performed an Affymetrix microarray RNA quantification
to identify genes with changed mRNA expression level. The in silico
analysis of the expression profile also included pathway and gene
ontology (GO) analyses, and was subsequently validated by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on selected differentially
expressed mRNAs. An overview of the experimental workflow is depicted
in Figure 1C.

Origamicin Induces Changes in the mRNA Profile in HCV Replicon
Cells
We performed an Affymetrix microarray hybridization
experiment to identify the gene expression profile of origamicin-treated
Huh7 cells harboring the HCV subgenomic replicon. After the data preprocessing,
we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis as well as a principal
component analysis (PCA) to determine the overall similarity among
mRNA profiles under the tested conditions (Supporting Information, Figure S2). We found that the mRNA profile of
cells treated with 25 μM origamicin, which corresponds to the
origamicin HCV replicon IC50Replicon value,32 was similar to that of the mock-treated cell. However, when Huh7
cells were treated with 50 μM origamicin concentration, which
was reported to have a strong inhibitory effect on the HCV replicons,32 we observed pronounced changes in the mRNA profile.
Volcano plots, which relate the fold change of gene expression to
the p-value of the corresponding change, nicely illustrate
this observation (Supporting Information, Figure S3). The volcano plots indicate that only a few genes showed
statistically significant expression changes at the lower origamicin
concentration, whereas the higher concentration caused expression
changes in a substantially larger number of genes.

In order
to further study the origamicin-induced changes in mRNA levels, we
removed low-intensity mRNA signals from the data set and also excluded
mRNAs showing an expression change of less than two, and finally performed
correction for the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamin–Hochberg
procedure.36 We found that 25 μM
origamicin induced the differential expression of 165 genes of which
88 were upregulated, whereas the treatment with 50 μM origamicin
increased the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) more
than 13-fold to 2196 with a ratio of upregulated versus downregulated
of nearly 2:1 (Figure 2A). Interestingly, almost all DEGs at the lower concentration of
25 μM origamicin are part of the DEGs at 50 μM origamicin
(Figure 2B). A heat
map of all the 157 DEGs shared between both treatment conditions revealed
similarities in the gene expression pattern. In addition, the expression
changes of these selected DEGs showed the same pattern as the hierarchical
cluster analysis and the PCA of the global gene expression.

Origamicin Affects Cellular Redox Homeostasis and Stress Responses
We focused on the upregulated genes in the subsequent analysis.
The lists of the top 25 upregulated genes in the 25 μM origamicin
treatment (Table 1)
and the ones in the 50 μM origamicin treatment (Table 2) show a similar pattern of
upregulated genes.

Interestingly, we noticed the enrichment of several genes that
are involved in cellular stress responses, for example, PTGR1, HMOX1,
and S100P. PTGR1 acts as an antioxidant enzyme37 and HMOX1 is a well-established component of the oxidative stress response.38 S100P was described as upregulated during the
ER stress response and as being involved in apoptosis.39 To verify our initial conclusions, we performed
pathway analysis and GO classification analysis on the identified
DEGs. However, we were not able to find a clear pattern among the
upregulated genes for the 25 μM origamicin treatment. As described
above, the general mild effect of this treatment condition is likely
to have only a small effect on the gene expression profile. The absence
of an obvious pattern among the downregulated genes at this treatment
condition supports this assumption (Supporting Information, Table S1). By contrast, pathway analysis of the
identified upregulated genes in the 50 μM origamicin treatment
regimen indicated that these genes are all involved in the UPR and
in ER-related pathways (Figure 3A). Furthermore, GO classification analysis on the high concentration
treatment regime shows an accumulation of genes involved in the ER
and oxidative stress response, the unfolding protein response, and
apoptosis-related processes (Figure 3B). Interestingly, a majority of all genes downregulated
by 50 μM origamicin (Supporting Information, Table S2) are part of the cell cycle and cell division pathways
(Supporting Information, Figure S4). This
observation is in agreement with previous reports of initiation of
cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase mediated by the protein kinase R
(PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) receptor.40 The cell cycle arrest is caused by the phosphorylation
of eIF2, which also causes translational attenuation to prevent the
ER from further protein loading,41 consistent
with the changes in mRNA levels that we observe related to cell cycle
arrest.

Figure 3 GO and pathway analyses. (a) Pathway enrichment analysis and (b)
GO analysis classifying genes by the biological process (showing only
the top 20 hits) were performed using ToppGene and selecting genes
upregulated by >1.0 log2 fold in origamicin-treated E9
cells. The bars represent the ratio of identified genes versus all
annotated genes in the corresponding pathway or biological classification,
respectively. The red curve represents the adjusted p-value corrected for FDR using the procedure by Bonferroni.

Experimental Validation of the in Silico Analysis by qRT-PCR
We validated our computational analysis on selected candidate genes
that were previously identified as upregulated in both treatment conditions
and showed a broad range of expression changes (Supporting Information, Table S3). Therefore, we repeated
the treatment of E9 cells with 25 μM origamicin, extracted the
RNA, and performed qRT-PCR quantification of mRNAs for selected candidate
genes: PTGR1,37 AKR1C1,42 HMOX1,38 BLVRB,43 S100P,39 CSTA,44 G6PD,45 CBR1,46 and NQO1.47 All of these genes
showed significant upregulation as expected (Figure 4A). Moreover, the magnitude of the expression
change was in agreement with our microarray data indicated by a Pearson’s
product-moment correlation coefficient of r = 0.81
(Figure 4B).

threshold for expression change. At least three independent experiments

significance was evaluated by using an unpaired two-sample Student’s t-test (* for p-value < 0.05, ** for p-value < 0.01, and *** for p-value
< 0.001). (b) Correlation analysis between genes that were identified
via microarray and qRT-PCR validation using Pearson’s product-moment

It should be noted that several of these selected genes (e.g. HMOX1,
S100P, CSTA) are known for their inhibitory role in HCV replication.48−50

Discussion
Here, we present new evidence for PDI inhibition by origamicin,
a relatively uncharacterized inhibitor of PDIs, originally derived
from the plant hormone ABA.32 Unlike ABA,
this synthetic small molecule inhibits the activity of PDI.32 This indicates that the introduced chemical
modifications converted ABA into a new type of PDI inhibitor.

To our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the effect
of PDI inhibition on cellular metabolism using comparative gene expression
analysis. We identified a large number of DEGs upon origamicin treatment.
Remarkably, all upregulated genes among these DEGs are linked to protein
unfolding response, redox homeostasis, and ER stress. As PDI is directly
involved in oxidative protein folding in the ER, we conclude that
exposure of cells to this PDI inhibitor impairs protein folding in
the ER lumen and induces ER stress (Figure 5). The cellular counter measure for ER stress
is the UPR, which can induce apoptosis as a long-term response.51 The immediate response, however, is the PERK-mediated
translation attenuation and cell cycle arrest as well as upregulation
of proteins involved in assisting protein folding, that is, chaperones.52 A common example of such a chaperone in the
context of ER stress is HSPA5 (also referred to as BiP or GRP78).53,54 We were not able to detect upregulation of HSPA5 in our study; however,
it has been shown that hepatocytes Hsp40 and Hsp70 are potent modulators
of the UPR.55 This is in agreement with
our finding that several HSP40 or HSP70 chaperones are significantly
upregulated (e.g., Hsp40B4, Hsp40B9, Hsp70A1, Hsp70B1).

Figure 5 Suggested mechanism of inhibition of HCV.

HCV replication critically depends on optimal metabolic conditions
that include an efficiently working protein biosynthesis machinery.56 In addition, HCV is heavily dependent on a proper
ER environment because of the location of HCV’s viral factories
in the ER and the dependency on the ER for viral egress.57,58 Hence, it is expected that perturbation of the ER homeostasis through
PDI inhibition causes disruption of the HCV life cycle but the exact
mechanism has to be elucidated in further studies.

Moreover, the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the glycoproteins
E1 and E2 is a prerequisite for the assembly of infectious viral particles.31,59 Consequently, the failure of the disulfide bond formation system,
mainly constituted by PDIs, might substantially affect the production
of infectious viral particles. We are aware of the limitations of
a subgenomic replicon system lacking these envelope proteins and,
hence, HCV replicon models are not a suitable choice to study viral
assembly and egress. Further research using infectious virus is needed
to determine the antiviral effect of PDI inhibition on HCV’s
life cycle. There are other (flavi)viruses—such as the dengue
virus or Zika virus—which similar to HCV are also strongly
dependent on ER homeostasis and PDI activity.60 Thus, they are interesting targets for further investigating the
impact of PDI inhibition on viral life cycles.

Conclusions
Our findings have implications for the role of PDI in the life
cycle of HCV and potentially for other members of the flaviviridae
family. We conclude that chemical modification of naturally occurring
molecules is a promising approach to provide new antivirals and novel
drugs for other diseases, which are desperately needed.

Materials and Methods
Tissue Culture
Huh-7 human hepatoma cells, a kind gift
from Dr. Lubica Supekova (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla,
CA), harboring the HCV subgenomic replicon plasmid pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1,
obtained as previously described,33 were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco-Invitrogen,
Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 100 nmol nonessential amino
acids/L (Gibco, Burlington, ON, Canada), 50 U penicillin/mL, 50 μg/mL
streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (Cansera International, Rexdale,
ON; PAA Laboratories, Etobicoke, ON, Canada), and 250 μg/mL
G418 Geneticin (Gibco, Burlington, ON, Canada). The pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1
plasmid that contains HCV subgenomic replicons and expresses HCV nonstructural
proteins (NS3 to NS5B) from the encephalomyocarditis virus internal
ribosome entry site was utilized as previously described.32,60,61 Cells were either mock-treated
with methanol or treated with origamicin (provided by Suzanne Abrams)
with a final concentration of 25 or 50 μM, respectively, for
24 h and then harvested.

Total RNA Preparation for Microarray Experiments
Total
RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario)
as per the manufacturer’s protocols. The RNA was quantified
using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, and the quality of the
RNA was verified using the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies,
Mississauga, Ontario).

Gene Expression Analysis
Cellular RNA samples were
hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix GeneChip
HG-U133 Plus2). Primary image analysis was performed by using GeneChip
version 3.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The data sets were processed
as previously described62 and subsequently
converted to log2 transformed data. A first analysis for
DEGs (log2 fold change cut-off > 2) was performed using
a two-sided t-test for unpaired data with equal variances
(p-value cut-off < 0.05). The R packages “genefilter”
and “limma” were used to further analyze and filter
the data set.63,64 Genes with expression values
lower than the mean in at least three microarray samples were deemed
“absent” and excluded from the subsequent analysis.
DEGs were determined using the empirical Bayes approach in combination
with multiple hypothesis testing based on the methods of Benjamini
and Hochberg.36 An adjusted FDR p-value of <0.05 was set as the threshold for significance.
Genes were annotated using the Affymetrix annotation files (HG-U133_Plus_2;
release 36) in conjunction with GeneAnnot 2.2.65 Pathway and GO analyses were performed using the ToppGene
Suite.66 Affymetrix raw data are provided
in the Supporting Information.

Luciferase Reporter Assay and Total Protein Quantification
Huh-7 cells stably expressing HCV subgenomic replicons were treated
with PDI inhibitors (i.e., 16F16 and securinine, Sigma-Aldrich) for
24 h as described previously.32 Briefly,
cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed with cell culture lysis buffer
(Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase assay substrate was added, and
expression of luciferase was determined by bioluminescence measurement
on an Lmax luminometer (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale,
CA). Total protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC protein
assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. EC50 values were determined by plotting luminescence activity
against the concentration values and fit using a four-parameter equation.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
RNA
isolation and quantification was performed as described above. The
RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gel
in 1 × TBE (Ambion). Reverse transcription of 500 ng of total
RNA using the Superscript II RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols was performed on a T100 thermal cycler
(Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was subsequently performed on a CFX thermal
cycler (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), as per the
manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in the Supporting Information, Table S4. Fold changes
in expression relative to mock-treated samples were calculated with
the 2–ΔΔCq method using 18S rRNA levels for normalization.67 Data are presented as the mean of replicates. Statistical
significance was evaluated using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson’s
product-moment correlation coefficient.

Statistical Analysis
We used the auxiliary R packages
“gplots”,68 “plotrix”,69 “ggplot2”,70 and “Venn diagram”,71 and functions such as cor.test() for data analysis and drawing figures.
