Two Cu(II)-malonate complexes with 2-amino-4-methylpyridine
(complex 1) and 2-aminopyrimidine (complex 2) auxiliary
ligands were synthesized, and their single-crystal X-ray diffraction
structures were established. Change in the auxiliary ligand exhibits
substantial structural variation in the present complexes. Complex 1 shows a one-dimensional anionic copper-malonate moiety connected
by the malonate bridge, whereas complex 2 is a mononuclear
one. For both the complexes, auxiliary ligands are attached with the
Cu-malonate moiety through various noncovalent interactions. Optical
band gap, electrical conductivity, and photosensitivity of complexes 1 and 2 were measured, but the values of electrical
parameters of the complexes significantly differ from each other.
However, the magnitudes of electrical parameters increase several
times for both the complexes when they are exposed under visible light,
though the values of light sensing parameters of complex 1 were found to be higher than those of complex 2. Density
functional theory calculations for complex 1 were carried
out to support the experimental result.

1 Introduction
The realm of transition
metal complexes is considered to take up
one of the forefront positions in the traditional field of chemistry
and considered to cover almost all the relevant topics from structural
to functional point of view. This extensive field of chemistry using
transition metals and organic ligands as building blocks is enriched
with high design ability and diversity of architectural motifs.1−4 These complexes are capable of forming polymeric chains through
coordination bonds;5−7 besides, they can also produce supramolecular polymers
via weaker noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, lp···π,
π···π stacking, π···cation,
and π···anion interactions.8−12 A preferred combination of these weak interactions
along with covalent bonds form a supramolecular building block that
takes an active participation in the field of drug delivery, gas storage,
separation, barrier diode, sensing, and catalysis.13−16 Some specific noncovalent interactions
involving aromatic systems such as π···π
and salt bridge···π have immense influence in
various chemical and biological processes as well.17,18 Again, inclusion of additional aromatic N-donor auxiliary ligands
in transition metal complexes creates diversity to the existing supramolecular
structures as these N-donor ligands can participate in hydrogen bonding
and π-ring containing weak interactions as well as coordinate
to the metal.19−21

The complexes formed by the judicious choice
of transition metal
and organic ligands have shown promising applications as functional
materials because of their fascinating structural features and supramolecular
behavior.22−26 Various dicarboxylate or polycarboxylate ligands are the preferable
choice for the formation of this type of complexes because of their
several binding motifs and binding capability to the metal center
in more than one way.27−30 Though the electrical properties of these complexes are not very
striking because of the large number of insulating carbon atoms of
the dicarboxylic acid present in molecular assembly, there are several
pieces of evidence that the proper choice of secondary ligands can
stimulate the charge transport phenomenon of the complexes.31−33 The noncovalent interactions associated with the above said complexes
often influence the structures of the complexes because they are able
to further connect the coordinated structural motifs into high-dimensional
supramolecular networks,34,35 which also leads to
the changes in electrical properties of the transition metal complexes.36,37

In this present study, we have synthesized two copper(II)-malonate
complexes with auxiliary ligands 2-amino-4-methylpyridine (for complex 1) and 2-aminopyrimidine (for complex 2) (Figure 1) in aqueous media.
The role of weak noncovalent interactions is also explored from their
single-crystal X-ray diffraction structural studies. Depending on
the nature of the aromatic amine cation (auxiliary ligand) and binding
mode of the malonate moiety, the Cu(II) units exhibit diverse topologies.
For complex 1, malonate oxygen atoms bind to Cu(II) and
two different metal centers are connected through carboxylate bridges,
whereas complex 2 is a monomeric Cu(II)-malonate unit.
For both complexes, auxiliary ligands are attached with the Cu-malonate
moiety through various noncovalent interactions such as H-bonding,
π···π, lp···π, and
salt bridge···π and provide additional stability
to the existing molecular assembly. Electrical and photosensing properties
of both the complexes were also studied. Generally, the majority of
porous metal–organic complexes are unable to afford any free
charge carriers or low-energy pathways for charge transport and perform
mostly like electrical insulators where conductivity is found to be
very low.22 Only since the past couple
of years, researchers tried to design novel structures, both porous
and nonporous materials, which have been utilized to engender conductivity.25,37−40 Electrical conductivities for our present complexes having partly
delocalized systems are 4.83 × 10–3 S m–1 (for 1) and 2.02 × 10–3 S m–1 (for 2), which are comparable
or even better than many reported values in the literature.25,37−39,41 Electrical characterization
discloses the Schottky diode (SD) nature of both the present complexes,
though the magnitude of electrical conductivity of complex 1 is found to be higher than that of complex 2. Recently,
some of us reported two Cu(II) complexes made up of an aromatic dicarboxylic
acid (phthalic acid) ligand for SD applications.24 The complexes described herein show better performance
in terms of electrical conductivity, photosensitivity, and on/off
ratio.24 Thus, the present complexes can
be utilized as potential candidates for implementation in light-sensitive
electronic devices.

2.2 Structural Description of Complex 1
The crystal structure of complex 1 (crystal
data and structure refinement parameters are presented in Table S1) shows two different copper-malonate
units where the copper atoms lie on inversion centers. In the diaquabis(malonato)copper(II)
unit, the Cu(II) ion generates a distorted octahedron where two malonate
oxygen atoms (O6 and O7) and their symmetric counterparts (O6* and
O7*, * = 2 – x, −y, 1 – z) generate an equatorial plane and
two water oxygen atoms O9 and O9* occupy the trans axial position.
The other Cu(II) ion is in an octahedral coordination environment,
where two malonate oxygen atoms (O2 and O3) and their symmetric counterparts
(O2# and O3#, # = 1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z) form
the equatorial plane of bis(malonato)copper(II) unit and two trans
axial carbonyl oxygen atoms O5 and O5# from the diaquabis(malonato)copper(II)
unit bind the metal center (Figure 2). In the asymmetric unit, there are two protonated
2-amino-4-methylpyridine, one unprotonated 2-amio-4-methylpyridine
and one hexafluoridophosphate anion. In the equatorial plane, the
Cu–O bond lengths vary from 1.923(3) to 1.966(3) Å, whereas
the apical Cu(2)–O(9) and Cu(1)–O(5) bond lengths are
much longer than the equatorial bond lengths (Table S2) but are in the normal range of values with malonate
complexes reported earlier.42−45 The bond lengths and bond angles are included in Tables S2 and S3, respectively.

domain is generated through the symmetry operation.

In the solid state, the title structure is stabilized
through N–H···O,
O–H···O, N–H···F, C–H···O,
and C–H···F hydrogen bonds and π···π
stacking and carbonyl (lp)···π interactions (Tables S4–S6). Two copper-malonate units
are interconnected through the carboxylate bridge for the formation
of a one-dimensional (1-D) polymeric network (Figure S3) that is further strengthened by the O–H···O
hydrogen bond between the water oxygen atom and carbonyl oxygen atom
of the partner molecule. The parallel chains are then interconnected
through weak C–H···O bonds by generating a R22(8) ring motif. Again, the water oxygen atom O9
plays as the donor to the carbonyl oxygen atom O4 in the molecule
at (1 + x, y, z). These two kinds of hydrogen bonding contacts interconnect the
parallel chains to form a two-dimensional (2-D) framework in the (110)
plane (Figure S4). Again, in both sides
of the polymeric chain, four protonated aminopyridine moieties are
juxtaposed with the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the diaquabis(malonato)copper(II)
unit to generate four salt-bridge (SB)42,43,46 units. However, the amine nitrogen atom of the aminopyridine
moiety acts as the double donor to bind the metal-coordinated carboxylate
oxygen atoms of the bis(malonato)copper(II) unit. One SB unit of the
diaquabis(malonato)copper(II) unit is juxtaposed to the other SB with
a separation distance of 3.838 Å. Because of the self-complementarity,
the π-cloud of the aminopyridine moiety is oriented toward the
another SB unit with a separation distance of 3.619 Å. Therefore,
an extended SB···SB/SB···π supramolecular
network is evidenced (Figure 3). Moreover, the carbonyl oxygen atom O4 from the bis(malonato)copper(II)
unit is oriented toward the π-face of the protonated aminopyridine
ring with a separation distance of 3.664(3) Å, suggesting significant
lone-pair···π interaction.45,47−49 Finally, the aminopyridine rings are optimized through
π+–π+ stacking50−52 interactions with an interplanar spacing of 3.358 Å and a ring-centroid
separation of 3.702(3) Å (Table S5). Therefore, lone-pair (lp)···π+/π+–π+ supramolecular network
is responsible to perform a vital role in building the extended network
structure (Figure 3).

and lone-pair (lp)···π+/π+–π+ networks in complex 1.

2.3 Structural Description of Complex 2
The crystal structure of complex 2 shows one
monomeric [Cu(C3H2O4)2(PF6)] unit and one noncoordinated hexafluoridophosphate
anion and four protonated 2-aminopyrimidine molecules (Figure 4). The coordination mode around
the metal center can be best described as a distorted square-pyramid
(τ = 0.024, eq S1) with the CuO4F chromophore where the four-malonate oxygen atoms generate
the basal plane and the axial position is occupied by the fluorine
atom F7 of the hexafluoridophosphate anion having a bond length of
2.4933(14) Å (Table S2). The sixth
empty coordination position is occupied by the F(6) atom of another
hexafluoridophosphate anion having a bond length of 2.854(2) Å
which is longer than Cu(1)–F(7) and is expected for a d9 system because of the pronounced Jahn–Teller
effect.

Figure 4 ORTEP view and atom numbering scheme of complex 2 with
displacement ellipsoid at the 50% probability.

The crystal structure of complex 2 is stabilized through
N–H···O, N–H···N, N–H···F,
C–H···F, C–H···O hydrogen
bonds and π–π stacking, anion···π,
and carbonyl (lp)···π interactions (Tables S4–S6). In the first substructure,
the malonate carbon atoms C(2) and C(5) act as donors to the carbonyl
atoms O(5) and O(4) to generate a R22(8) dimeric
ring. Interconnection of the dimeric rings leads the molecules to
form an infinite chain along the [010] direction (Figure S5). The carboxylate oxygen atoms act as acceptors
to the pyridine and amine nitrogen atoms of the protonated 2-aminopyrimidine
ligand. The carbonyl atoms from the 1-D chains are oriented toward
the π-cloud of the pyrimidine ring with a separation distance
of 3.093(2) Å. This lone-pair (lp)···π interaction47−49 interconnects the parallel chains to form a 2-D supramolecular assembly
(Figure S6). In another substructure, the
protonated pyrimidine nitrogen atom of four 2-aminopyrimidine moieties
is in contact with the three carbonyl and one carboxylate oxygen atoms,
and three-amine nitrogen atoms from the 2-aminopyrimidine moieties
are interconnected with the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the malonate
moieties. Thus, two SB units are interconnected by a separation distance
of 3.532 Å (Figure 5). Moreover, the molecular packing is such that the π+–π+ stacking interactions50−52 between the
aminopyrimidine rings are optimized with an interplanar spacing of
3.407 Å and a ring-centroid separation of 3.971(2) Å. In
the opposite side, the pyrimidine rings are interconnected through
the π+–π+ stacking interactions
with a ring-centroid separation of 3.766(2) Å and an interplanar
spacing of 3.361 Å. The combination of C–H···O
hydrogen bonds and π+–π+ interactions
results in a 2-D supramolecular framework in the (110) plane (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Supramolecular framework
generated through SB···SB
and π+–π+ interactions in
complex 2.

In the final substructure, the carbonyl oxygen
atom O(1) is oriented
toward the π-cloud of the (N2/C7/N3/C10/C9/C8) ring in the molecule
at (1 + x, y, z) with a separation distance of 3.093(2) Å. Because of self-complementarity,
the pyrimidine ring is in contact with another pyrimidine ring through
face-to-face π+–π+ interaction
with a separation distance of 3.971(2) Å. Finally, the F(9) atom
of the hexafluoridophosphate anion binds the centroid of the 2-aminopyrimidine
moiety with a separation distance of 3.089(2) Å. Therefore, the
cooperativity of weak noncovalent interactions leads the molecules
to generate lone-pair (lp)···π+/π+–π+/π+···anion
assembly (Figure 6).
These supramolecular networks generate a chain along the [100] direction.
The self-complementary C–H···O hydrogen bonds
interconnect the parallel chains to build a supramolecular layered
framework in the (110) plane (Figure 6).

2.4 Optical Characterization
In the present
study, the solid-state absorbance spectra of the complexes (inset, Figure 7) have been recorded
by preparing the thin films of well dispersion of complexes in dimethylformamide
(see Pages S10 and S11) in the range 200–700
nm. The direct optical band gap (BG) has been estimated using Tauc’s
equation (eq 1).53 1  Here, “α”, “Eg”, “h”,
and “ν” stand, respectively, for the absorption
coefficient, BG, Planck’s constant, and the frequency of light.
“A” is a constant which is considered
as 1 for the ideal case.

Figure 7 UV–vis absorption spectra (inset) and
Tauc’s plots
for (A) complex 1 and (B) complex 2.

By extrapolating the linear region of the plot
(αhν)2 versus hν to
α = 0 absorption, the values of direct BG (Eg) have been evaluated as 3.38 and 4.16 eV for complexes 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 7).

The obtained BG for both the synthesized
complexes and the presence
of strong absorbance in the visible wavelength region signify some
conducting nature of the synthesized complexes. Motivated from these
analyses, the electrical characteristics of the synthesized complexes
have been further studied.

2.5 Electrical Characterization
For analyzing
the electrical properties, we measured the I–V characteristics of both the complex (1 and 2)-based multiple devices under dark conditions (Figure S7) and have calculated various major
electrical parameters of these devices (Table S7). The obtained values of various parameters have been compared
in Table S7, which indicate that the devices
named as “Test device 1” for both the complexes (1 and 2) are the best devices among the others.
Hence, we have selected “Test device 1” for both the
complexes (1 and 2) as the final device
and carried out all the electrical measurements to investigate the
semiconducting properties of our synthesized complexes (1 and 2).

Figure 8 represents the I–V characteristics under both the dark and AM 1.5G radiation (illumination)
conditions of the complex (1 and 2)-based
final device.

Figure 8 I–V characteristics
curve
and the log I vs voltage plot (inset) of complex
(1 and 2)-based devices under both dark
and illumination conditions.

The conductivities under the dark condition were
found to be 1.53
× 10–3 and 0.88 × 10–3 (in S m–1), respectively, for complex 1- and 2-based thin-film devices (Figure 8). However, with photoirradiation, the conductivity
of the complex 1- and 2-based devices significantly
improved to 4.83 × 10–3 and 2.02 × 10–3 S m–1, respectively. These results
depict that the conductivity of the complex 1-based device
improves nearly three times more than in the dark conditions, and
for the complex 2-based device, it improves approximately
2 times more than in the dark conditions.

The representative I–V characteristics (Figure 8) of the complex-based devices
clearly exhibited a nonlinear
curvature with highly influencing rectifying nature under illumination,
which is the signature of a light sensing SD. The photosensitivities
for the complex (1 and 2)-based devices
have been calculated as 4.41 and 3.14, respectively. At ±2 V,
the rectification ratios (Ion/Ioff) have been found to be 39.45 and 30.23 under the dark
condition and 97.48, 65.46 under the illumination condition for the
complex 1- and 2-based devices, respectively.

The I–V characteristics
of the complex (1 and 2)-based SDs have
been further analyzed by thermionic emission theory and Cheung’s
method53 by considering following standard
equations53,54 2   3  Here, I0, q, k, T, V, A, η, and A* stand for
the saturation current, the electronic charge, Boltzmann constant,
temperature in Kelvin, forward bias voltage, effective diode area,
ideality factor, and effective Richardson constant, respectively.
The effective diode area has been estimated as 7.065 × 10–6 m2, and the effective Richardson constant
has been considered as 32 AK–2 cm–2 for all the devices.

At low bias, linearity in current is
observed, which is consistent
with the electron lifetime, whereas at higher bias, voltage deviation
from linearity occurs for the change in diode series resistance (Figure 8). From Cheung, in
terms of series resistance, the forward bias I–V characteristics can be expressed as53 4  where the IRS term
is the voltage drop across series resistance of the devices. In this
context, the series resistance can be determined from the following
functions using eq 5(55,56) 5  

Equation 5 can also
be expressed as a function of I as 6  

The series resistance (RS) and ideality
factor (η) for both devices under the dark condition have been
determined (Table 1) from the slope and intercept of dV/dln (I) versus I plot (Figure S8A), respectively. The deviation of η (Table 1) from the ideal value (1) may
be for the existence of inhomogeneities of Schottky barrier height
and series resistance at the junction.57,58

a Figures in the brackets are the
associated errors.

The value of barrier height (ØB) can be calculated from eq 6 using the just obtained η values. A plot of H versus I will lead to a straight line
(Figure S8B) with the y-axis intercept being equal to ηØB, which also gives the value of series resistance. The measured ØB, η, and RS under dark and light conditions for the metal (Al)–semiconductor
(synthesized complexes) (MS) junctions are listed in Table 1. From the table, it is clear
that in both methods (eqs 5 and 6) using Cheung’s function the RS value remains almost the same. Each parameter
for the complex (1 and 2)-based thin-film
MS devices (Table 1) improves the performance after light soaking. The ideality factor
for both complexes approached very close to 1 under illumination,
generally indicating the less interfacial charge recombination and
better homogeneity of Schottky junctions53 under photoirradiation. The higher rectification ratio under the
photoirradiation condition attributes lower barrier height and reduction
in series resistance than in the dark condition indicates the large
increase of photocurrent. These observations together portrayed the
applicability of the synthesized complexes in the field of optoelectronic
devices. From this viewpoint, electrical conductivity data of some
recently reported Cu-complexes along with our synthesized Cu-malonate
complexes are provided in Table S8. Comparing
these values, it can be concluded that our reported complexes have
adequate potentiality for implementation in different optoelectronic
devices.

The above listed Schottky device parameters (Table 1) clearly reveal better
performance of the
complex 1-based device over the complex 2-based device. A justification for this behavior may be proposed based
on the structural features and supramolecular behavior of the complexes.
In complex 1 having a 1-D coordination polymeric structure
(Figure S3), charge can move through continuous
chains of covalent and coordination bonds (through bond conduction).
On the other hand, in monomeric complex 2, charge transfer
might involve much weaker C–H···O hydrogen bonding
interaction in 1-D chains (Figure S5 and
the discussion therein), which is less effective in the coordination
polymeric system.24 Noncovalent interactions
present in their solid-state structure furnish higher dimensionality
to both the complexes. In complex 1, the parallel chains
are interconnected through O–H···O (1.99 Å)
and C–H···O (2.38 Å) hydrogen bonding and
generate a 2-D framework (Figure S4), whereas
in complex 2, lone-pair (lp)···π
[3.093(2) Å] interaction interconnects the parallel supramolecular
chains to generate a 2-D supramolecular assembly (Figure S6). This implies that the shorter interchain distance
in complex 1 may facilitate the electrical properties
in complex 1 than in complex 2.25 These facts together may enhance the charge
transport properties in complex 1.

The charge transport
phenomenon was further analyzed from the I–V plot in the logarithmic scale
under both conditions (Figure 9A). log I versus log V curves
(Figure 9A) exhibit
two dissimilar slopes (region-I and region-II) with different values.
In region-I (slope ≈ 1), current follows the relation I ∝ V (Ohmic regime), and in region-II
(slope ≈ 2), current is proportional to V2, typical of a trap free space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
regime53,59 which has been implemented here for the
estimation of some vital parameters such as effective mobility (μeff), transit time (τ), and diffusion length of charge
carrier (LD).55,56,59

Figure 9 (A) log I vs log V and (B) I vs V2 curves
under both dark
and illumination conditions for the complex (1 and 2)-based thin-film device.

Following the SCLC model, the effective carrier
mobility was calculated
from the higher voltage region of I vs V2 plot (Figure 9B) by the Mott–Gurney equation,53,56,59 7  where V, ε0, εr, and d stand for the applied
voltage, permittivity of free space, dielectric constant, and thickness
(considered as ∼0.9 μm), respectively, of the film.

To calculate the εr value, capacitance versus
frequency (Figure S9) has been plotted,
and using the value of capacitance at the saturation level, εr has been calculated by the following equation53 8  Here, C is the value of capacitance
at saturation, L is the thickness of the film, and A is the effective area.

The values of capacitance
at saturation point for complexes 1 and 2 are 1.23 × 10–10 and 7.13 × 10–11 F, respectively. Using these
values, dielectric constants of complexes 1 and 2 have been evaluated as 1.97 and 1.14, respectively.

Transit time (τ) has been evaluated using eq 9 from the slope of the SCLC region
(region-II) (Figure 9A).53 Diffusion length of the charge carriers
is further extracted from eq 10(53) 9   10  where D is the diffusion
coefficient. Carrier lifetime has been extracted from the slope of
region-II in log I versus log V graph,
which is shown in Figure 9A. Using the Einstein–Smoluchowski equation,53 the diffusion coefficient has been calculated
as 11  

All the estimated parameters from the
SCLC region are listed in Table 2. Under irradiation,
the increased mobility represents higher transport rate, and the number
of charge carriers also increases under light. Again, the increased
diffusion length under the same condition revealed that the charge
carriers travel extra length before recombination, which direct the
eventual increase in current displayed by the devices under light.
From these estimated values, it can be clearly stated that the charge
transport properties of the complexes quite improved after light soaking
(Table 2).

2.6 Theoretical Rationalization
The density
functional theory (DFT) calculation of the semiconductor properties
has been carried out only for complex 1 because complex 2 exhibits an experimental BG higher than 4 eV, which is considered
beyond the upper limit (4 eV) to belong to the wide BG semiconductor
family. The structure of complex 1 was modeled using
DFT and the experimental crystal lattice as the starting point for
the optimization of the atomic positions. Standard band theory along
with partial density of state (PDOS) calculations has been employed
for the analysis of the properties of the optimized structure. For
plotting the Kohn–Sham electronic energy levels as a function
of the reciprocal space vector k, we have chosen a path along the
first Brillouin zone (BZ) passing through a set of high symmetry points,
as depicted in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Electronic band structures for the ground state of complex 1. Points of high symmetry in the first BZ are labeled as
follows: G = (0, 0, 0); F = (0,
0.5, 0); Q = (0, 0.5, 0.5); Z =
(0, 0, 0.5).

A direct BG of 3.38 eV is obtained from UV–vis
spectra,
while the theoretical BG gives an underestimated value of 2.78 eV.
The theoretical methodology gives the properties of the pure isolated
material, whereas other effects, such as metal–semiconductor
interface, semiconductor thickness, excitons, defects, and impurities,
influence the experimental BG, which are obviously not considered
in the theoretical calculations. Moreover, previous reports have shown
that BGs are underestimated by DFT methods.60

Our results show that the direct BG occurs in the Γ
(0, 0,
0) point and belongs to the semiconductor family in agreement with
experimental findings. The semiconductor nature of the material also
agrees with the results obtained from DOS calculations that are shown
in Figures 11 and 12.

Figure 11 Total DOS calculation of complex 1. The lines
represent
the s-orbital character (blue), p-orbital character (red), and d-orbital
character (green) of the atoms into the crystal.

Figure 12 Calculated PDOSs in the solid state of complex 1.
(A) α-Cu atoms, (B) malonic acid ligands, (C) 2-amino-4-methylpyridine ligands, and (D) hexafluorophosphate
anions.

Figure 11 shows
the total DOS of alpha and beta electrons of complex 1. The PDOS analysis shows the presence of isolated intermediate bands
because of β electrons in the Cu 3d orbitals likely because
of metal–ligand interactions,61 which
have not been considered for the calculation of the BG and the subsequent
analyses because they are very weakly populated.

The PDOS calculation
(Figure 12) shows
that the p-character of the malonic acid ligands
and the d-character of Cu atoms (a lesser extent) dominate the valence
bands. However, the conduction band is dominated by the p-character
of the 2-amino-4-methylpyridine ligands. Hexafluorophosphate anions
do not directly influence the upper and lower states of the BG in
agreement with other hybrid materials.62−64

By means of DFT
calculations, it is possible to relate the frequency
dependence of an incident photon in a material with the calculation
of the dielectric function ε(ω) (Figure 13).

Figure 13 The left panel shows the real and imaginary
(solid and dotted lines,
respectively) parts of ε(ω) vs the photon energy in complex 1. The right panel shows the real and imaginary parts (solid
and dotted lines, respectively) of optical conductivity vs the photon
energy of complex 1. The incident “x”, “y”, and “z” directions of polarized radiation are represented
in blue, green, and red lines, respectively.

How much material is polarized upon application
of an electric
field is given by the real part of ε(ω) and how much material
is absorbed is given by the imaginary part. A photon-energy range
of 0–10 eV has been used to measure the optical response in x, y, and z directions
where the crystal is illuminated (εxx, εyy, εzz). In this material, the εxx and εyy components coincide, having the
prominent peaks at 3.5, 4.4, 5.1, and 6.0 eV. However, the εzz component presents the most intense peaks at 4.4 and 5.0
eV, which can be assigned to transitions from the highest valence
band to the lowest conduction band. The optical conductivity σ(ω)
is convenient to study how the conductivity increases when the material
is illuminated. The increment in photoconductivity and electrical
conductivity is a consequence of the photon absorption.61 The calculation of σ(ω) (see Figure 13, right) shows
that only particular wavelengths have noticeable optical response
and that it is more important (higher intensity) in one direction
into the crystal (green line). In particular, complex 1 starts to absorb at 2.0 eV, and the maximum peaks are located at
3.5, 4.3, 5.0, and 6.0 eV.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
synthesized two Cu(II)-malonate complexes
(complexes 1 and 2) with different auxiliary
ligands, established their solid-state crystal structures, and explored
the noncovalent interactions associated with their solid-state structures.
We have also investigated the optical, dielectric, and electrical
properties of both the complexes. The binding motifs and solid-state
structure of the Cu(II)-malonate moiety are different in the two complexes.
Again, the change in auxiliary ligands also alters the supramolecular
behavior for complexes 1 and 2. These structural
variations and different supramolecular behaviors may collectively
affect the electrical properties of the complexes. All the parameters
obtained from electrical characterization exhibit better result for
complex 1 than for complex 2. In the case
of complex 1, the polymeric structure and extended supramolecular
network may be the reason behind its superior performance. In the
Al/(complex 1, 2)/ITO configuration, Schottky
device parameters of both complexes show better performance on illumination
to visible light. Thus, it emerges that these kinds of complexes will
have potentiality in fabricating optoelectronic devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Physical Measurements
Elemental analyses
(C, H, N) were performed on a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer.
IR spectra were recorded during the Fourier transform IR spectral
measurement with the samples following the attenuated total reflectance
technique on a PerkinElmer spectrometer (Spectrum Two). Solid-state
UV–vis spectroscopy was carried out using a PerkinElmer UV–vis
Lambda 365 instrument. The electrical characterization was performed
with a Keithley 2635B source meter, interfaced with a personal computer.

4.2 Materials
All reactions were carried
out under aerobic conditions and in aqueous medium. Malonic acid,
copper(II) chloride dihydrate, 2-amino-4-methylpyridine, 2-aminopyrimidine,
and ammonium hexafluorophosphate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co. All chemicals used were of reagent grade and used without
further purification. Freshly boiled, doubly distilled water was used
throughout.

4.3 Synthesis of Complex 1
Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (0.170 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in
20 mL of water and allowed to react with malonic acid (0.208 g, 2.0
mmol) in water (25 mL) at 60 °C. A warm aqueous solution (20
mL) of 2-amino-4-methylpyridine (0.432 g, 4.0 mmol) was added dropwise
to the above solution with continuous stirring. Finally, a warm aqueous
solution (20 mL) of ammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.652 g, 4.0 mmol)
was added to it under stirring conditions. The reaction mixture thus
obtained was heated at 60 °C for an hour with continuous stirring.
The resulting blue solution was then cooled to room temperature and
filtered to remove any undissolved materials. Mother solution was
then left unperturbed for crystallization at room temperature. Block-shaped
blue single crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray structure analysis
were obtained after a few weeks. The crystals were separated by filtration,
washed with ice-cold water, and then air-dried, yield 0.497 g (66%).

4.4 Synthesis of Complex 2
Complex 2 was synthesized using identical methods to
those for complex 1 in aqueous medium using copper(II)
chloride dihydrate (0.170 g, 1.0 mmol), malonic acid (0.208 g, 2.0
mmol), 2-aminopyrimidine (0.380 g, 4.0 mmol), and ammonium hexafluorophosphate
(0.652 g, 4.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C
for an hour with constant stirring. The resultant mother liquor was
then cooled, filtered, and left unperturbed for crystallization at
room temperature. The yielded block shaped, blue single crystals suitable
for X-ray structure analysis were separated after a few weeks. The
crystals were washed with cold water and dried in the air, yield 0.573
g (61%).
