Explicit antigen–antibody
binding has accelerated the development
of immunosensors for the detection of various analytes in biomedical
and environmental domains. Being a subclass of biosensors, immunosensors
have been a significant area of research in attaining high sensitivity
and an ultralow sensing limit to detect biological analytes present
in trace levels. The highly porous structure, large surface area,
and excellent biocompatibility of hydrogels enabling the retainability
of the activity and innate framework of the attached biomolecules
make them a suitable candidate for immunosensor fabrication. Hydrogels
based on polycarboxylate, cellulose, polyaniline, polypyrrole, sodium
alginate, chitosan, and agarose are exploited in conjunction with
other nanomaterials such as AuNPs, GO, and MWCNTs to augment the electron
transfer during the immunosensing mechanism. Surface plasmon resonance,
electrochemiluminescence, colorimetric, and electrochemical assays
are different strategies utilized for the signal transduction in hydrogel-based
immunosensors during the formation of the antigen–antibody
complex. These hydrogel-based immunosensors exhibit rapid response,
excellent stability, reproducibility, high selectivity and high sensitivity,
a broad range of detection, an ultralow limit of detection, and display
results similar to those for the ELISA test. This review propounds
different hydrogel-functionalized immunosensing platforms classified
on the basis of their signal transduction for the detection of disparate
cancer biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor, α-fetoprotein, prostate-specific
antigen, carbohydrate antigen 24-2, carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific
enolase, and cytokeratin antigen 21-1), hormones (cortisol, cortisone,
and human chorionic gonadotropin), human IgG, and ractopamine in animal
feeds.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In the past several years,
exponential growth has been evidenced
in the field of biosensors. A biosensor is an analytical device in
a miniaturized form which comprises a bioreceptor and a transducer.
The bioreceptor recognizes the target analyte, and the transducer
converts the biochemical signal produced to a measurable signal wherein
the signal is further processed to display the concentration.1,2

Immunosensors are a subclass of biosensors fabricated in order
to recognize different analytes with regard to the explicit binding
between the antigen and its respective antibody and have developed
immense requirements in fields such as cancer diagnosis and food quality
control. For the effectual construction of immunosensors with potential
analytical performance, it is essential to prepare an immunosensing
platform so as to ensure the immobilization of immunologically sensitive
agents (antigen or antibody) and signal transduction.3 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), colorimetric,
piezoelectric, radiometric, and electrochemiluminescent assays are
the various immunoassays developed to date for the sensitive detection
of different biomarkers.4 Biomolecules
such as proteins, steroids, and several others are complex molecules
that evince slightly similar chemical structures. To bypass false
indications, the response of the sensor has to be analyzed gingerly.
Whether the analysis is in vitro or in vivo, besides good sensitivity,
the biosensor should also acquire good target specificity.5 Because the biomarkers in biological fluids are
present in low concentrations, the primary objective of an immunosensor
is to improve the sensitivity and to attain an ultralow limit of detection,
whereby different approaches for signal amplification have been explored.6,7

Various immunosensing platforms have been recorded by utilizing
nanomaterials (magnetic or metal nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes),
polymers (molecularly imprinted polymers, self-assembled monomers),
and gels (hydrogel, sol–gels).3 These
materials should possess good biocompatibility to preserve the activity
and innate framework of the attached biomolecule as well as good conductivity
to improve the transport of electrons across the device surface and
should exhibit good stability.3,8 The electrical properties,
a large surface area, and the ability to inhibit the clustering of
metal NPs during immobilization are all attributable to the utilization
of carbon-based nanomaterials such as MWCNTs and graphene oxide (GO).9

A hydrogel is a three-dimensional porous
material made up of interpenetrating
polymeric networks (IPNs) that possess extensive biomedical applications,
in particular, biosensing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.
The excellent hydrophilicity, large surface area (due to the interconnected
porous structure), and excellent biocompatibility of hydrogels are
due to their potential employment in biosensors. The nonrigid porous
hydrated gel reduced the steric hindrance and augmented the immobilization
of biomolecules and target binding compared to those of conventionally
used surface-based assays. Different types of hydrogels such as conductive
hydrogels and redox hydrogels, promoting rapid electron transfer,
play a vital role in analyte detection and signal amplification, so
they are exploited to modify the immunosensing platform.3,4,10−12

The present
review reports state-of-the-art literature analysis
and summarizes the employment of hydrogel-based immunosensing platforms
of varied compositions utilizing various signal-transducer principles
(SPR, electrochemiluminescence, colorimetrics, and electrochemical
signals) for the recognition of a variety of analytes such as cancer
biomarkers (cytokeratin antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1), α-fetoprotein,
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), carbohydrate antigen 24-2 (CA242),
neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumor
necrosis factor (TNF-α)), hormones (cortisol, cortisone, human
chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)), human IgG, and ractopamine in animal
feed. The fabrication, mechanism of detection, range of detection,
and limit of detection of all of the hydrogel-based immunosensors
have also been discussed.

2 Transduction Principle in
Hydrogel-Based Immunosensors
The biochemical signal produced
during the antigen–antibody
interaction is converted to a measurable signal by the transducer.
This conversion can occur via different transduction pathways based
on the type of transducer. And the signals that are generated are
directly proportional to the concentration of analyte detected. As
shown in Figure 1,
the signal-transduction methods in hydrogel-based immunosensors can
be classified into four primary methods—surface plasmon resonance
(SPR), electrochemical, electrochemiluminescence, and colorimetric
wherein the electromagnetic field generated, change in electrical
properties, electrogenerated chemiluminescence, and change in color
are measured, respectively. Disparate hydrogels employed for immunoassays
are discussed elaborately in this section and summarized in Table 1 along with their
signal transduction technique, the linear range of detection, and
the limit of detection.

transduction techniques

2.1 Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Immunoassay
This optical surface-sensitive technique enables real-time monitoring
of biological interactions that are in close proximity to a transducer
without the need for labels. An SPR immunosensor comprises a light
emitter, a detecting device, a transducer, a prism, a biomolecule,
and a flow system. SPR corresponds to the generation of the electromagnetic
field on the thin metal film when light of an appropriate angle and
wavelength is incident on it. The generated field is strong at the
surface and decreases with an increase in depth from the interface.
The SPR principle of detection is depicted in Figure 2.13 SPR is a nonselective
technique; it requires a well-planned strategy to obtain selectivity.

In 2009, Fransconi et al.5 were the
first to report an immunosensor based on the SPR principle of detecting
corticosteroids in saliva and urine. The amine coupling enabled the
covalent immobilization of antibodies, and the binding capacity of
antibodies (anticortisol) on the SPR-based gold disk was increased
by modifying it with polycarboxylate hydrogel. The SPR signal was
observed when cortisol binds to the immobilized anticortisol, and
the strong interaction made the resonant angle shift steadily. The
highly sensitive and rapid immunoassay offers a response time of 15–20
min against the analysis of cortisol and cortisone. They exhibit detection
ranges of 30 to 174 μg/L for cortisone and 5 to 154 μg/L
for cortisol with detection limis of 9 and 2 μg/L, respectively.
The sensitivity of the immunosensor is affected by interfering molecules
after a certain concentration. This immunosensor is stable and reusable
for 100 cycles.

2.2 Electrochemical Immunoassay
The performance
of an electrochemical immunosensor is associated with the electrode
chemical interface characteristics. Amperometric and impedimetric
are two types of electrochemical immunosensors which work on the principle
of change in current or impedance. The electrical conductivity, the
specified surface area, and the structure and biocompatibility of
the interfacial layer play vital roles in electrochemical signal transduction.
Electrochemical methods have several advantages, including high sensitivity,
simple and feasible instrumentation, miniaturization, and cost-effectiveness.

2.2.1 Sandwich-Type Electrochemical Immunoassay
Zhou et al.
in 2013 developed a novel supramolecular hydrogel-based
sandwich immunosensor to sense IgG in humans, and its function is
illustrated in Figure 3.7 The hydrogel produced by modifying
amino acid phenylalanine with ferrocene (Fc) was drop cast on the
glassy carbon electrode along with chitosan to render the hydrogel
stable on the device surface, and on this reformed surface, gold nanoparticles
were immobilized to enable the absorption of antibody anti-IgG (Ab1). The immunosensor label (CNT-GOx-Ab2) was prepared
by the functionalization of a carbon nanotube (CNT) with glucose oxidase
(GOx) and anti-IgG (Ab2). The Fc moieties present in the
hydrogel exhibit strong redox activity, but GOx catalyzes glucose
to produce a byproduct, H2O2, such that it,
in turn, oxidizes the Fc groups by diffusing into the chitosan/hydrogel
layer, thereby causing a decrease in the redox peak of the electrode.
The redox activity decrease is in proportion to the IgG concentration
analyzed. The immunosensor displayed high selectivity and sensitivity,
considerable reproducibility with a relative standard deviation of
2.7%, and a broad linear range (0.1 to 100 pg/mL) with a LOD of 50
fg/mL.

form to detect IgG. Reproduced with permission from ref (7). Copyright 2013, Elsevier.

In a sandwich format, a hydrogel-based immunosensor
for the sensing
of TNF-α was fabricated by Hou et al. in 2013.6 The hydrogel prepared by functionalizing amino acid and
phenylalanine with ferrocene (Fc) couched a considerable number of
Fc moieties and imparted the redox properties. The stability of the
hydrogel immobilized on the electrode was rendered by mixing it with
chitosan. The adsorption of anti-TNF-antibody (Ab1) on
the hydrogel-modified electrode was facilitated by AuNPs, and this
electrode acted as the platform for sensing. For the label, a polystyrene
sphere (PS) was adopted as the material to support the freighting
of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and anti-TNF (Ab2) and thereby
make the immunosensor highly sensitive. When TNF-α was captured
by Ab1 and Ab2, ascorbic acid (AA) was produced
as ALP catalyzed ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA-p) hydrolysis. The
formed AA reduced the Fc moieties present in the hydrogel, resulting
in a decline in current peak and hence detects the TNF concentration.
This sandwich-type immunosensor has detectability from 1 pg/mL to
10 ng/mL and 0.5 pg/mL LOD, reproducibility with a relative standard
deviation of 4.3%, and good storage stability. The results of clinical
analyzed samples showed the proper consistency, with ELISA indicating
reliability in the method.

In another work, Zang et al. developed
a sandwich-based immunosensor
with an AuNP-loaded polyaniline hydrogel as the substrate, and the
labels were mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) coated with polydopamine
(PDA) which enveloped methylene blue (MB).14 Both the hydrogel and the label were antibody immobilized by AuNPs
and blocked by BSA. These labels were considered “smart”
because they were pH-triggered, and before the analysis, under acidic
conditions, they were destroyed. Concurrently, the hydrogel adsorbed
the liberated MB, and the distance reduction between the electrode
and redox particles yielded signal amplification. The disengagement
of the insulant layer (antigen–antibody complex) and the labels
decreased the interfacial resistance and increased the current. To
detect PSA, this immunosensor displayed excellent selectivity, reproducibility,
and a broad range of detection (10 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL) with a low
LOD (1.25 fg/mL). The optimized parameters were the temperature (40
°C), pH (7.5), and incubation time (50 min). The immunosensor
exhibited good stability by retaining 89.1% of its current response
and recovery in the range of 98.5 to 106.5%.

2.2.2 Label-Free
Electrochemical Immunoassay
In 2014, Huang et al. developed
an immunosensor to detect PSA utilizing
a redox-active hydrogel.3 The ferrocene
(Fc) incorporated amino acid, phenylalanine, and the hydrogel was
embodied with nanofibers of diameter 50 to 100 nm and a length of
1 mm. The Fc groups in the hydrogel promoted electron flow, and the
hydrogel-modified electrode exhibited strong redox peaks. The chitosan
layer stabilized the hydrogel on the electrode, and the gold nanoparticles
adsorbed on the chitosan enabled antibody (anti-PSA) immobilization.
The quantitative detection of antigen (PSA) was proportional to the
redox peak suppression during the antigen–antibody interaction.
They displayed recovery in the range of 96.9 to 108%, and the relative
standard deviation obtained was lower than 6%. This cost-effective
immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity, good PSA selectivity, a broad
range (1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL), and a limit of detection of 0.5 pg/mL.

CEA was detected by a label-free amperometric immunosensor fabricated
by Rong et al. in 201511 by employing a
nanostructured conducting network of polypyrrole hydrogel and gold
nanoparticles. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) had been modified
using the polypyrrole hydrogel, formed by the reaction between phytic
acid and the pyrrole monomer. AuNPs integrated into the hydrogel via
electrodeposition enhanced the electron conductivity of the electrode
and served as an immobilization matrix for anti-CEA. The immunological
reaction among anti-CEA and CEA resulted in the suppression of the
current response. This immunosensor displayed excellent selectivity,
reproducibility, stability, a broad detectability (1 fg/mL to 200
ng/mL), and an ultralow LOD of 0.16 fg/mL. The CEA concentration detection
conducted on human serum samples by this immunosensor was compared
with ELISA to obtain a relative error of −4.2 to 7.1%, indicating
accuracy and considerable reliability.

Tang et al. in 2016 designed
an immunosensor for the ultrasensitive
detection of CA242 employing the sodium alginate-Pb2+-graphene
oxide (SA-Pb2+-GO) redox hydrogel.4 The sensing platform was obtained by first coating the GCE with
the SA-Pb2+-GO hydrogel and chitosan, to enrich it with
Pb2+ further, and then immobilizing anti-CA242 utilizing
glutaraldehyde. The conductivity of SA-Pb2+-GO/GCE was
enhanced by the addition of Pb2+ and GO and resulted in
signal amplification. The interaction of CA242 with anti-CA242 increased
the resistance of the electrode and caused a significant drop in current.
This immunosensor exhibits a broad linear range (0.005 to 500 U/mL)
and an ultralow LOD (0.067 mU/mL). The proposed immunosensor indicated
stability by retaining 90% of its current response even after storage
at 4 °C for a month, and when tested against human serum samples
and compared with ELISA, it showed a relative error lower than 10%.

In order to detect NSE, an immunosensor was proposed by Wang et
al. in 2016 by employing a conductive hydrogel.15 Fe3+ and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid were
used as the metal ion and ligand, respectively, for the preparation
of the hydrogel by a cross-linking coordination method. The electrodeposition
of AuNPs on the hydrogel, drop coated on GCE, enhanced the immobilization
of anti-NSE and electron transport. Blocking agent bovine serum albumin
(BSA) was used, and the specific binding of NSE inhibited the transfer
of electrons, ensuing a drop in the peak current. The immunoassay
displayed good repeatability, excellent analytical performance, stability,
NSE specificity, and a broad linear detection range (1 pg/mL to 200
ng/mL) with 0.26 pg/mL as the limit of detection. This immunosensor
obtained accuracy and good reliability because the relative standard
error of its practical test on human serum samples was less than 7%
when compared with ELISA.

A catalytically conductive aniline-
and vinyl-ferrocene (Fc)-based
redox hydrogel was utilized by Li et al. in 2017 to fabricate a prostate-specific
antigen (PSA)-detecting immunosensor.16 AuNPs facilitated the adsorption of antibody (anti-PSA) on the hydrogel-modified
electrode and enhanced the conductivity. The catalytic activity of
Fc enabled signal amplification by the oxidation of ascorbic acid
to dehydroascorbic acid. The binding of PSA on anti-PSA inhibited
electron transfer; thus, the decrease in the redox currents enabled
the detection of PSA. The proposed immunosensor displayed a detection
range from 0.001 to 200 ng/mL and 0.54 pg/mL LOD. As −7.3 to
6.0% was the relative standard deviation between the ELISA and the
practical application of the immunosensor, it showed good reliability.
The immunosensor displayed high storage stability by retaining 90.4%
of its current response even after 4 weeks of storage at 4 °C.

In 2017, Wang et al. introduced a conductive hydrogel-based amperometric
immunosensor for NSE detection.17 Thionine
and pyrrole were the monomers, ammonium persulfate and HAuCl4 were co-oxidizing agents, and glucose was the doping agent used
for the synthesis of the conductive hydrogel. This hydrogel (polypyrrole-polythionine
hydrogel) functions as the substrate for sensing (by enhancing the
transfer of electrons and signal amplification) and immobilizing the
antibodies (anti-NSE). The electron transfer was further enhanced
by the electrodeposition of AuNPs, and good analytical performance
was obtained by the signal amplification via a cascading reaction.
H2O2 produced during the catalytic reaction
of glucose with GOx was further catalyzed by polythionine. Both reactions
resulted in an enhancement in the redox signal, enabling its exploitation
as a platform for sensitive detection. The anti-NSE/NSE complex was
formed as the concentration of NSE increased, and current suppression
was observed. pH 6.5 and 50 min were the optimized pH and incubation
temperature. A good detection range (1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL) with a
low LOD (0.65 pg/mL) was displayed by the immunosensor. This immunosensor
exhibited storage stability wherein the current response was decreased
by only 10% and the relative standard deviation lower than 10% when
compared to electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLI)
tests.

The AuPd nanoparticle-multiwalled carbon nanotube composite
(AuPd-MWCNT),
ferrocene carboxaldehyde (Fc-CHO), and a chitosan hydrogel were utilized
by Yin et al. in 2017 to develop an NSE-detecting immunosensor.9 Chitosan provided numerous binding locations
to the electroactive species, Fc-CHO, such that they display electrocatalytic
activity toward H2O2 and generate a redox response
via electron transfer. Signal amplification was further achieved by
the synergistic enzyme-free catalytic activity of Au-MWCNT and Fc-CHO
composites on H2O2. Glutaraldehyde enabled the
immobilization of anti-NSE on the Au-MWCNT/CS-Fc hydrogel, and BSA
was used as the blocking agent. The resistance increase during the
antigen/antibody interaction exhibited a drop in the current peaks,
evidencing the detection of NSE. This amperometric immunosensor provided
a range of detection from 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL with a limit of detection
of 0.483 pg/mL. The optimum incubation time was 50 min at pH 7.5,
and the substrate with a volume ratio of Au-Pd-MWCNT to CS-Fc was
considered optimum for producing a strong signal. The results after
practical clinical tests displayed a relative standard error lower
than 10% when compared with ELISA.

An immunosensor for the determination
of serum ferritin was a novel
proposal.18 In this immunosensor, ferritin
antibody (FeAb) was immobilized on a GCE modified with the agarose
hydrogel. The current response reduction percentage (CR%) was proportionate
to the ferritin concentration and was maximized at 0.1 g/L, enabling
a wide range of detectability ((5–50) × 10–5 g/L) with a LOD of 1.5 × 10–5 g/L, but this
immunosensor has only 10 days of stability whereby a 15% decrease
in peak current occurs. The optimum incubation time and temperature
for the formation of the antigen–antibody complex were 30 min
and 32 °C. The detected ferritin can be acceptable for low concentrations
but not for high concentrations when compared to the clinical RIA
method.

Yin et al. fabricated an immunosensor based on the decomposition
of the Fe3+-alginate hydrogel by the Fenton reaction.19 To enhance the conductivity, MWCNT was utilized
to modify the electrode, and the Fe3+-alginate hydrogel
was developed in situ. The NSE sandwiched labeled immunoprobes of
anti-NSE (Ab1) magnetic beads (MB) and Ab2-GOx-SiO2-GOx oxidized glucose to produce H2O2 and gluconic acid. When the modified electrode is submerged in the
enzyme reaction mixture, the Fenton reaction occurs by the conversion
of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the presence of H2O2. The immunoreaction was performed within the MWCNT,
and the Fe3+ consumption led to the decomposition of the
Fe3+-alginate hydrogel, thereby decreasing the interface
resistance. As the NSE concentration increased, the current signal
also increased and thereby showcased an ultralow LOD of 0.447 pg/mL
and a detection range of 0.001 to 100 ng/mL. The 0.5 wt % alginate
volume, pH 5.0, and 40 min were the optimized parameters. Good clinical
analysis can be obtained because its relative error is lower than
10%, thereby providing reproducibility and around 99% recovery.

In the agarose gel, Shen et al. incorporated ractopamine-bovine
thyroglobulin antigen to fabricate an immunosensor to detect ractopamine
in animal feeds.8 The GCE was coated with
the hydrogel modified with antigens, and K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] was made use of as the
redox probe to monitor the reaction. The specific binding of ractopamine-bovine
thyroglobulin antigen with antiractopamine antibodies hindered the
electron flow of the redox marker toward the GCE by insulating it.
Hence, the immunosensor’s percentage of current response reduction
measured was proportionate to the concentration of ractopamine in
the range of 1–1000 ng/mL. The optimum incubation time, temperature,
and pH were 30 min, 37 °C, and 7.4, respectively. And 40 μg
mL–1 was the optimum concentration of the antibody
chosen. Ractopamine was practically determined in animal feeds by
this immunosensor, and in comparison with ELISA, the immunosensor
results showed good consistency with a recovery of around 80–110%.

By the cross-linking coordination method, a conductive hydrogel
was prepared from phytic acid (ligand) and lead (II-metal ion) that
displayed strong electroconductivity at −0.5 V.20 To fabricate the immunosensor, Wang et al. utilized
this hydrogel to drop coat on GCE such that it was used as a substrate
for sensing cytokeratin antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1). The antibody (anti-CYFRA21-1)
immobilization was attributable to AuNPs which were electrodeposited
on the hydrogel and further enhanced the conductivity of the electrode.
BSA was used as the blocking agent, and a drop in the current was
witnessed during the antigen–antibody conjugation. The fabrication
procedure of this immunosensor is illustrated in Figure 4. As the pH and incubation
time affected the results, they were optimized to pH 6.5 and 50 min
during the experiments. The designed immunosensor displayed a good
linear range of detection and a low LOD of 50 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL and
38 fg/mL, respectively. From the test conducted on clinical samples,
it could be deduced that they exhibited selectivity toward CYFRA21-1
and good consistence with ELISA wherein the relative standard error
lower than 10% and the relative standard deviation of 6% indicated
good reliability and repeatability. Less than 10% was the change in
the electrical response observed when kept under 4 °C for a week,
which indicated good storage stability.

To overcome the challenges of signal amplification,
Zhao et al.
constructed a sandwich-type immunosensor based on Ca2+-elicited
pH-response sodium alginate precipitation for PSA detection.21 On the GCE, anti-PSA (Ab1) was immobilized
after the electrodeposition of AuNPs. The immunoprobes were labeled
with gold nanoparticles-CaCO3 microspheres (AuNP-CaCO3), anti-PSA, and bovine serum albumin (BSA), and they imply
a strong hindrance effect. The immunoprobes were conjugated with the
sensing platform after Ab1 captured PSA molecules. Alginate
gelation was triggered by the Ca2+ ions released under
weakly acidic conditions, and the further elevation in the impedance
signal is attributable to the negatively charged alginate surface
which is pH-responsive. The cascading impedance response (ΔRct)
was measured for the ultrasensitive detection of PSA. The potential
of this immunosensor was realized when an acceptable relative error
of 5.88–5% was observed when compared with the chemiluminescence
immunoassay analyzer (CMIA). The immunosensor displayed good specificity,
stability, and reproducibility, a rapid response time, and a linear
detection range of 1 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL with a limit of detection
of 0.09 fg/mL.

2.3 Colorimetric Immunoassay
In colorimetric
immunoassays, alkaline phosphatase and horseradish oxidase were the
probes commonly used, and the biological signals are indicated by
color to provide direct and rapid readout.

In 2019, for α-fetoprotein
(AFP) detection a colorimetric immunosensor based on cellulose hydrogel
was developed by Ma et al.22 In this, the
microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) hydrogel employed provided the antibody
binding site, and graphitelike carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets loaded with AuNPs were fixed in it to form a
hybrid hydrogel (Au@g-C3N4/MCC). On antibody–antigen
conjugation, the catalytically active AuNPs displayed a “switching
on/off” mechanism and the superoxide ion radicals that were
produced reduced the yellow 4-nitrophenol to a colorless 4-aminophenol
substrate during the transfer of electrons from g-C3N4 to AuNPs. The catalytic activity of the hybrid hydrogel was
“turned off” and “turned on” while AFP
detached and conjugated with the anti-AFP, respectively. For the immunoassay,
this color-changing mechanism was used for the quantitative analysis
of AFP, and it is represented in Figure 5. The immunosensor used exhibits good stability
(10% less than for the fresh composite) and repeatability and a selectivity
toward AFP of within 0.1–10 000 ng/mL with a limit of
detection of 0.46 ng/mL. The results of the immunosensor tested on
real samples showed agreement with ELISA with a relative error of
−4.3 to 2.8%.

2.4 Electrochemiluminescent
(ECL) Immunoassay
Electrochemiluminescence or
electrogenerated chemiluminescence
is a type of luminescence produced during an electrochemical reaction
when electrogenerated intermediates undergo excitation and relax to
the lower state by emitting light.23

Zhang et al. in 2017 constructed an ultrasensitive immunosensor for
the analysis of HCG based on the sandwich protocol.24 The GCE was coated with polyaniline hydrogel and loaded
with Pt nanoparticles to enhance the electron transfer, and via glutaraldehyde,
antibodies (Ab1) were captured on the substrate. In this,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was employed as the H2O2-catalyzing enzyme and as the blocking agent for nonspecific
binding sites. The luminescent probe was prepared by adding BSA to
Au star and enabling the capture of luminol, a luminescent material
by GA, which further promoted the immobilization of antibodies (Ab2) on its surface. Sandwiched immunoreactions exist between
the synthesized luminol-Au star@BSA-Ab2 complex and the
modified sensor during the conjugation of the HCG antigen. The electrochemical
signal was amplified by the ability of nano-Pt and HRP to catalyze
H2O2 to engender reactive O2.– and OH· which consequently act
as a coreactant of luminol. The fabrication of both the label and
the substrate is schematically represented in Figure 6. This immunosensor exhibited stability,
selectivity, reproducibility, a detection range of 0.001 to 50 mIU/mL,
and a limit of detection of 0.0003 mIU/mL. The ranges of relative
deviations (0.19 to 3.31%) and recoveries (92.20 to 101.49%) indicate
their reliability.

3 Conclusion and Future Perspectives
Owing to its highly porous structure, large surface area, and excellent
biocompatibility, hydrogels have been successfully employed in nanobiosensing.
Hydrogels of varied compositions have been explored for the immobilization
of biomolecules (antigen or antibody) to fabricate immunosensors with
great analytical potential. SPR, electrochemiluminescence, colorimetrics,
and electrochemical assays were the different strategies involved
in the signal transduction in hydrogel-based immunosensors during
the formation of the antigen–antibody complex. Electron transfer
to the electrode during immunoreaction was augmented by the functionalization
of these 3D gels by nanomaterials such as AuNPs, GO, and MWCNTs.

In this review, we have recapitulated disparate hydrogels such
as conductive, redox, and smart hydrogels employed in immunosensors
for the recognition of cancer biomarkers (TNF-α, AFP, PSA, CEA,
CA242, NSE, CYFRA21-1), hormones (cortisol and cortisone, HCG), human
IgG, and ractopamine in animal feed. Herein, the hydrogel-based immunosensing
platforms are classified by virtue of their mode of signal transduction.
The immunosensors discussed here exhibit rapid responses, good stability,
reproducibility, and high sensitivity and selectivity and display
results similar to those in the ELISA test.

The global market
of biosensors has predicted growth of 16.9 billion
USD in 2017 to 25.9 billion USD by 2022, which reveals a compound
annual growth rate of around 9%. Concurrently, 27.2 billion USD represents
the reported global market for hydrogels by 2022 with an estimated
6.3% CAGR. The future of hydrogels as an immunosensing platform relies
on the progressive requirement for the recognition of several other
analytes for food quality control, environmental monitoring, and diseases
other than cancer in both humans and animals. The full potential of
hydrogels has to be further explored because hydrogels other than
conductive hydrogels and hydrogels with metal ion chelation act as
sensing substrates for signal enhancement, and most of the hydrogels
were employed just as an immobilization matrix. New methods have to
be developed to monitor the hydrogel porosity wherein during immobilization
the biomolecule entrapped within large pores tends to become inactive
or cause bioreceptor leakage. Immunoassays with a shorter incubation
time would be favorable because the lowest optimum incubation time
for the formation of an antigen–antibody complex in hydrogel-based
immunosensors reported so far is 50 min. More research could be done
to prevent the destruction of hydrogels when detaching the bioreceptors
in irreversible immobilizations. Piezoelectric, colorimetric, and
electrochemiluminescent signal transduction principles with various
natural and synthetic polymeric hydrogels need to be analyzed more.
The potential of MXenes in immunosensors needs to be explored by functionalizing
different hydrogels with MXene nanosheets. Thus, the hydrogel-based
immunosensors may encounter a considerable market hike in the near
future.
