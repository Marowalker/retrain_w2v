Some earlier studies
suggested that graphene oxide (GO) sheets
adopt a crumpled configuration in water, similar to the shape of a
paper ball, which turns into an even more compact, collapsed form
upon addition of a poor solvent due to enhanced intrasheet affinity.
Although those results have been debated in studies concerning membrane
configurations, they are now often used to justify the existence of
folds and wrinkles in solution-processed GO-based structures. This
has led to a misconception that wrinkled and crumpled features may
be intrinsic to solution processing and unavoidable. Here, we connect
this problem to experimental observations of the liquid crystallinity
of GO dispersions, which clearly show that the sheets are neither
crumpled nor collapsed, with or without poor solvent. The sheets can
simply fold flat or restack to hide their surfaces from poor solvent,
without incurring the energetic cost of severe deformations to crumple.

Introduction
Determining the statistically likely configurations
of one-dimensional
polymer chains is a straightforward exercise, but the configurations
of two-dimensional (2D) solid sheets, first studied decades ago,1 remain a computational and theoretical interest.2−4 Graphene oxide (GO), which used to be called graphite oxide layers,
is a single-atomic-layer material made by chemical exfoliation of
graphite powders.5 GO sheets can be readily
made with apparent thickness of around 1 nm (Figure 1a) and lateral dimensions of micron to tens
of micron scale (Figure 1b),6 and they are well dispersible in
water. Therefore, they offer a convenient model system to study these
questions experimentally. About two and half decades ago, light-scattering
studies found that GO sheets in water are fractals with dimension
of 2.5, and this was taken to mean that GO sheets adopt a crumpled
conformation, akin to that of a crumpled paper ball.7,8 Adding more poor solvent, such as acetone, then further densifies
the GO crumples into a collapsed configuration7 with a fractal dimension near 3. In response to the light-scattering
studies, Spector et al. conducted freeze-fracture electron microscopy
studies but only found some lightly wrinkled sheets, instead of crumpled
structures.9 Because the samples for electron
microscopy observation needed to be frozen first, there was some speculation
that such a sample preparation procedure might have helped the “sloppy”
GO crumples to transform into a more flattened shape.10 Both light-scattering and electron microscopy can only
provide indirect results to infer the solution configuration of GO
sheets, so obtaining a direct, more robust experimental evidence about
GO’s configuration in a solution would help settle this debate.

force microscopy image showing the apparent thickness
of GO single layer to be around 1 nm. (b) Fluorescence quenching microscopy23 image showing an overview of GO sheets, with
lateral dimensions, defined as the diameter of the circumscribing
circle, at the micron scale.

More than a decade after this question was first experimentally
studied, GO has become a subject of extensive interest for alternative
reasons, such as a precursor for making graphene,11,12 and as an interesting material in its own right.13 The question of the sheets’ solution configuration
has now become technically relevant, especially for solution processing
of graphene-based sheets, because the properties of the final materials
are affected by features like wrinkles, folds, and crumples.14 Local wrinkles and folds are often observed
in solution-processed GO or graphene sheets.14,15 Unfortunately, the results of the earlier studies of the solution
conformation of GO sheets, represented by Wen et al.’s work,7 have been widely misapplied in graphene research,
which are often used to justify the existence of folds and wrinkles
in dried GO or graphene structures. This has become problematic because
it has created a misconception that those deformed features in GO
or graphene sheets are intrinsic to solution processing and unavoidable,
discouraging many from improving processing strategies for making
wrinkle-free thin films. Therefore, it has become important to revisit
this old problem both to solve a basic soft matter science puzzle
and address the new technological problems.

Results and Discussion
Here, we connect some known results from literature and present
new experiment observations that clearly show that with or without
bad solvent, GO sheets in water are neither crumpled nor collapsed.
A simple but effective marker for flat versus crumpled or collapsed
configurations is whether they can form a nematic liquid crystalline
phase in solution. With their high aspect ratios and excellent dispersity
in water, planar GO sheets should be able to align to form a nematic
liquid crystalline phase over a concentration threshold predicted
by Onsager theory.16,17 In recent years, Kim et al.18 and then Xu et al.19 have first demonstrated GO-based nematic liquid crystalline phases
in water. They observed a strong birefringence when viewing aqueous
dispersion of micron-sized GO sheets through a pair of cross-polarizers.
These results already suggest that GO sheets in water do not adopt
a crumpled configuration. If GO sheets were to transform into a shape
like crumpled paper balls or the even denser collapsed form, the resulting
particles would not have formed a nematic phase at all because their
contour is largely isotropic amid the complexity of the structures.

Testing the above-mentioned hypothesis linking sheet configuration
and liquid crystallinity would require model colloidal particles with
crumpled paper ball shape. In an earlier work, we have successfully
created such particles by mechanically squeezing the GO sheets using
capillary actions in evaporating aerosol droplets.20 GO can be thermally reduced during or after the aerosol
processing, yielding crumpled graphene balls (Figure 2a) with around 2.5 fractal dimension.21 The crumpled morphology is highly stable during
various materials processing steps involving mechanical stress or
different solvents.20,22 Such morphological stability
makes them the ideal model material representing the crumpled configuration
under various solvent conditions. When crumpled graphene balls are
dispersed in water and viewed through cross-polarizers, as expected,
no liquid crystalline phase was observed (Figure 2b,c), no matter how high their concentration
was.

Figure 2 (a) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image showing sub-micron-sized
crumpled graphene balls. (b) Photo of a dispersion of these particles
in water at a concentration of 0.01 wt %, taken under ambient illumination.
(c) When viewed through a pair of cross-polarizers (directions marked
by white arrows), no birefringence is observed for this sample or
others with concentration up to 1 wt %. Thin glass cuvettes with short
optical path length (1 mm for the one shown here) are used to allow
sufficient light to pass through the dispersion.

Next, we move to examine whether GO sheets would crumple
under
poor solvent conditions, as reported in the earlier scattering work.7 GO sheets were prepared and processed based on
previously published procedure,5,23 and have similar lateral
size distribution as those used in that work. GO dispersions were
also prepared at the identical concentration (0.01 wt %) and solvent
compositions (i.e., water and water/acetone mixture with 10 vol %
of acetone), both of which were found to exhibit birefringence when
viewed through cross-polarizers (Figure 3, left two vials). Then, we extended the
poor solvent condition and increased the fraction of acetone from
10 to 30, 50, 70, and finally 90 vol %. Birefringence was unambiguously
observed under all of these poorer solvent conditions (Figure 3). With 70 and 90 vol % of
acetone, GO sheets sedimented after aging—but they did so as
gels, which still remained highly birefringent, indicating high orientational
ordering in the sediment that can only be achieved with anisotropically
shaped units. Besides acetone, a number of other water-miscible solvents
such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and ethylene glycol were also
tested. Birefringence was persistently observed in GO aqueous dispersions
mixed with these solvents.

Figure 3 (a) Photo showing freshly prepared 0.01 wt %
GO dispersions by
mixing aqueous GO stock solution with acetone. From left to right,
the volume fractions of acetone are 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 vol
%. (b) All of the samples exhibit obvious birefringence when viewed
through a pair of cross-polarizers (directions marked by white arrows).
Strong birefringence is also observed for all of the samples after
the sheets were sedimented.

To rule out the potential confining influence between the
GO sheets
that may prevent them from crumpling, GO solution was added dropwise
to a large acetone bath over extended period of time (procedure illustrated
in Figure 4a). The
concentration of GO sheets in the acetone bath starts from near zero
and gradually reaches 0.002 wt % by the end of the 6 h of addition
(Figure 4b). The volume
fraction of the poor solvent acetone started at nearly 100% and gradually
reached 80 vol %. If the GO sheets were to crumple or collapse in
water/acetone mixtures as concluded in the earlier scattering study,7 this slow addition experiment would have created
the most favorable conditions for the sheets to do so during addition,
and they would have transformed into crumpled or collapsed geometries
by the end of this slow addition experiment. On the contrary, birefringent
schlieren texture is still vivid when the final dispersion is gently
swirled and observed through cross-polarizers (Figure 4c), indicating a liquid crystalline phase
with an orientational order that is characteristic of anisotropically
shaped units.

Figure 4 (a, b) Fifty milliliter of aqueous GO dispersion was added
dropwise
into an acetone bath of 200 mL over 6 h, reaching a final GO concentration
of 0.002 wt %. (c) The resulting dispersion still exhibits a strong
birefringence when viewed through a pair of cross-polarizers (directions
marked by white arrows).

In control experiments, dispersions of crumpled graphene
balls
did not exhibit birefringence in any of these poor solvent tests.
Taken together, our observations establish that GO sheets neither
crumpled nor collapsed in poor solvents. Then, why did not Wen et
al. observe the characteristic dimension of 2.0 for flat GO sheets
in their scattering experiments?7 Several
factors could be involved. As Abraham and Goulian pointed out, scattering
measurements can yield a higher-than-two fractal dimension for sheets
if their thickness is not uniform, especially when there is a scaling
relationship between their width and thickness.24 Such a nonuniformity may be contributed by local roughness
on the sheets, but also inhomogeneous dispersion that contains agglomerated
or flocculated sheets. Colloidal stability of GO sheets is quite sensitive
to the presence of ionic byproducts from synthesis,18,25 which are not trivial to remove.23 Today’s
researchers are well equipped with new knowledge about GO’s
colloidal properties and processing methods to make high-quality single-layer
dispersions. However, the samples used in the earlier scattering work7 may not be well-dispersed in water, as noted
in another related work from the same group.8 This suggests that the earlier GO samples may not have been sufficiently
purified, which could lead to the formation of small flocculates or
aggregates of GO sheets.18 These features
may not be obvious to visual observation, but they can yield fractal
dimensions in light-scattering experiments.

Crumpling a sheet
requires substantial mechanical work to generate
features like creases and vertices due to severe local deformation,24,26 yet it does a poor job of sheltering GO surfaces from solvent. Even
a densely crumpled paper ball still has about half of the surface
area of a planar sheet.27 However, face-to-face
restacking is a much more efficient way for sheets to hide their surfaces
from poor solvent, without incurring the energetic cost of those severe
deformations. In all of the experiments involving high acetone concentrations,
sediments of GO can be observed. But when the sedimented pieces were
collected and viewed under an optical microscope equipped with polarizers,
they were all found to be highly birefringent. An optical microscopy
image of a piece of sediment collected from the slow addition experiment
are shown in Figure 5a. The sample was dropcast onto a conductive, indium tin oxide-coated
glass slide to allow SEM studies. Figure 5b is the SEM image of the same piece, which
is made of restacked GO sheets. SEM also revealed many flat sheets
deposited on the substrate, similar to those reported before.6 Notably, they are neither crumpled nor collapsed.
Observation through cross-polarizers (Figure 5c,d) clearly shows the alignment of the sheets
in the sediment is parallel to the wrinkles. Therefore, formation
of flocculates and aggregates in the samples used for the earlier
scattering study might be the root cause of the elevated fractal dimensions
observed under the poor solvent conditions.

Figure 5 (a) Optical and (b) corresponding
SEM images of a piece of sediment
obtained from slow addition of GO sheets into acetone. The sample
was prepared by casting a droplet of the final dispersion containing
the piece. In the SEM image (b), many flat sheets can be seen in the
background that are neither crumpled nor collapsed. (c, d) Polarized
optical microscopy images (polarizer directions marked by white arrows)
indicate aligned microstructures along the horizontal wrinkles in
this particle.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, results that already existed in literature about
GO liquid crystals, in conjunction with the new observations reported
here, should clearly establish that GO sheets do not crumple nor collapse
into morphologies with nearly isotropic contour in poor solvent conditions.
Under the conditions most commonly used for solution processing of
GO, they maintain an extended, sheet-like shape. When self-attraction
becomes stronger, the sheets prefer to restack or fold flat, forming
anisotropic platelets. Although it is not always obvious, some form
of compressive stress, especially capillary action, is always present
during solution processing, which can readily deform the highly flexible
GO sheets28 to form extensively folded,
wrinkled, or crumpled features.14,15,20 However, this should not be attributed to solvent–sheet interactions.
Smooth sheets can indeed be obtained under carefully controlled dewetting
conditions during solution processing.6,29 The collective
organizational behavior of 2D sheets (e.g., their liquid crystallinity)
is a very effective marker of their shapes, which we recommend should
be included in future experimental studies of membrane configurations
in solution.
