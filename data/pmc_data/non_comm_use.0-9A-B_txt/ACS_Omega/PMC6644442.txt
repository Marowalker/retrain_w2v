The
H2-induced etching of low-dimensional materials is of significant
interest for controlled architecture design of crystalline materials
at the micro- and nanoscale. This principle is applied to the thinnest
crystalline etchant, graphene. In this study, by using a high H2 concentration, the etched hexagonal holes of copper quantum
dots (Cu QDs) were formed and embedded into the large-scale graphene
region by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition on a liquid Cu/W
surface. With this procedure, the hexagon flower-etched Cu patterns
were formed in a H2 environment at a higher melting temperature
of Cu foil (1090 °C). The etching into the large-scale graphene
was confirmed by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning
electron microscopy, and Raman analysis. This first observation could
be an intriguing case for the fundamental study of low-dimensional
material etching during chemical vapor deposition growth; moreover,
it may supply a simple approach for the controlled etching/growth.
In addition, it could be significant in the fabrication of controllable
etched structures based on Cu QD patterns for nanoelectronic devices
as well as in-plane heterostructures on other low-dimensional materials
in the near future.

Introduction
Graphene, a honeycomb crystal
carbon lattice, has attracted huge research interest during the past
few years due to its anomalous properties, including very high carrier
mobility, extremely high mechanical strength and optical transparency,
electrical conductivity, etc.1−25 As a result, graphene is considered to be an ideal nanomaterial
for next-generation semiconductors to replace silicon.

The etching
of material is the block removal from a material matrix by chemical
or physical methods—the reverse of the growth process. Understanding
the etching mechanism is necessary for material design as well as
the realization of its capabilities. Material growth/etching requires
a high-energy barrier nucleation process. Controlling the etching/growing
parameters may originate from the formation of a thermodynamic and
stably ordered structure with the ability to form a different kinetically
controlled metastable structures with high-energy crystal facets and
edges.

The material growth systems have been controlled with
different scales (nanometer to micrometer).26−28 The family
of snow-crystal-like graphene with patterns is formed by a nonlinear
process in nature.29 In contrast, the highly
crystalline materials (e.g., Si) are etched via an anisotropic rule,30 leading to stable etched patterns with Euclidean
geometries. The underlying mechanism is attributed to various etching
rates on various crystalline directions and surfaces related to various
free energies. However, the etched structures of low-dimensional materials
beyond Euclidean geometries have not been investigated.

The
high crystal C atom single-layer supplies a simple model to study
the fundamental growth and/or etching process via the chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) method. Significant efforts have been created to
develop graphene growth strategies with controlled size, crystallinity,
and edge structures via CVD.31−34 In addition, several reports on graphene etching
have been carried out utilizing various etchants, such as plasma H2,35−38 H2,39,40 and metallic nanoparticles.41−43 Recently, graphene crystal patterns were well-controlled through
inert gases and a H2 source.44

Those discoveries inspired us to additionally examine the
fundamental issue of the graphene etching mode. In this work, we report
the first observation of a new kind of etched geometry of a large-scale
grown graphene region that is beyond known Euclidean geometries to
date. The hexagon quantum dot (QD)-like etched Cu pattern is a new
morphology that has not yet been revealed.

Results and Discussion
For the etched graphene growth procedure on a liquid Cu/W substrate,
a schematic of the hexagon QD-like Cu pattern formation during low-pressure
CVD graphene growth onto a liquid Cu/W substrate is illustrated in Figure 1. Low-pressure chemical
vapor deposition (LPCVD) is investigated at low pressure (6 Torr)
using Cu (thickness of 250 μm) as a catalytic substrate located
on a W foil (thickness of 80 μm). First, a Cu/W substrate was
heated in the H2 environment (100 sccm) for 30 min to the
melting point of Cu (1090 °C) and then annealed in H2 (100 sccm) for 30 min. The integrated etching/growth proceeded via
the LPCVD approach with hexagon flower-etched Cu patterns, embedded
into the large-scale graphene located on a liquid Cu/W substrate using
a CH4/H2 ratio of 6/100 sccm in 30 min. Finally,
the furnace was opened and CH4 gas was turned off; H2 flow was continued for fast cooling to 100 °C.

CVD graphene growth on a liquid Cu/W substrate.

There have been several investigations on the controlled
diffusive etching modes for crystal growth of low-dimensional materials
that are responsible for etched graphene pattern formation,1−4,39 generating an effective engineering
method for etched patterns on other 2D and 3D material systems. However,
etching to form flower QD-like Cu patterns embedded into the large-scale
graphene region is quite new, strange, and intriguing in the field
of etching at the micro- and nanoscale. To date, there is no scientific
report in terms of theory and simulation investigations that detail
the relationship of the hexagonal-shaped etching mode and the underneath
graphene structure.

For morphology investigations of solid Cu,
liquid Cu, and graphene before and after the CVD process, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical
microscopy (OM) were carried out, as shown in Figure 2a–f. Here, Figure 2a exhibits the morphology of bare Cu foil
(250 μm) through the SEM image before the CVD process. Figure 2b reveals the SEM
image of liquid Cu at 1090 °C after being resolidified. Figure 2c is the micrograph
photo of etched large-scale graphene on the liquid Cu/W substrate. Figure 2d reveals the AFM
image of the surface liquid Cu after being resolidified on W foil
with a liquid Cu thickness of 150 nm after 1090 °C and resolidified
as shown in Figure 2e, corresponding to the blue line in Figure 2d. Figure 2f is the OM images of liquid Cu located on W foil after
being resolidified, corresponding to the AFM image in Figure 2d.

Figure 3 and
Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information reveal a new Euclidean geometry of the QD-like Cu patterns which
are partially etched Cu hexagons at the center of six edge sites and
embedded into the large-scale graphene located on the liquid Cu/W
surface after a higher melting point of Cu foil (1090 °C). Because
the melting temperature for W foil was 3422 °C, its morphology
did not change after treatment at 1090 °C. Similarly, the SEM
images at various magnifications were taken for hexagon flower-etched
Cu patterns embedded into large-scale graphene located on a liquid
Cu/W substrate, as shown in Figure 4 and Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information.

For further demonstrations, the AFM data were applied to
observe the hexagon flower-etched Cu patterns embedded into large-scale
graphene located on a liquid Cu/W substrate, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure S5 in
the Supporting Information for two-dimensional
(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images at different corners. In addition,
their phase images, which are characterized for softness, stiffness,
and the adhesion between the AFM cantilever tip with the specimen
surface, are shown in Figure 5d and Figure 5Sd.

flower-etched Cu patterns embedded into large-scale graphene located
on a liquid Cu/W substrate, (a,b) 3D AFM mapping image, (c) 3D AFM
mapping image at different views of (a), and (d) phase image of (a).

To investigate the existence of
graphene on liquid Cu/W and the Cu pattern etching effect, Raman spectroscopy
was carried out at two regions: graphene and Cu pattern (see Figure 6). At the Cu pattern
regions, the Raman peaks in Figure 6c,d correspond to the OM images that are directly captured
by the Raman analysis instrument, with the red cross in Figure 6a and the black cross in Figure 6b. They showed the
presence of some peaks of CuO, Cu2O, and Cu(OH)2, which are already well-known from a previous report.45 On the other hand, in the blue and green graphene
regions in Figure 6c and the red region in Figure 6d, corresponding blue and green crosses in Figure 6a and red cross in Figure 6b show clearly the
D, G, and 2D peaks of Raman data as the fingerprints of the graphene
structure on liquid Cu/W substrates. The Raman mapping of Figure 6b was also obtained
for the etched Cu pattern at a wavelength scan range from 0 to 800
nm for the typical existence of CuO, Cu2O, and Cu(OH)2 peaks (Figure 6g), which was proven in a previous report.45Figure 6a,f shows
the zoomed-in images of Figure 6c,d, respectively.

positions marked as blue, green, and red crosses in (a,b). (e,f) Zoomed-in
image of graphene in (c,d), respectively. (g) Raman mapping with a
scan range from 0 to 800 nm of region (b).

For an explanation about the mechanism of etched Cu pattern
formation embedded into large-area graphene film, see Figure 7. It is believed that the etching
mode occurred due to the diffusion of etchants (H2 molecules
or H radicals) at the graphene/liquid Cu interface and the diffusion
on the graphene surface. Consequently, the etching effect formed at
the defects sites or grain boundaries was embedded into the large-scale
graphene to create the hexagon QD-like Cu patterns. Here, the diffusion
at the graphene/liquid Cu interface might be the key role for formation
of the etched Cu pattern. The high etching rate is because of high
H2 etchant concentration as well as hindered diffusion
at the graphene/liquid Cu interface. H2 diffusion on isotropic
liquid Cu indicates the physical origin of the high symmetry of etched
Cu patterns. Also, it is a key factor for visualizing the etched line
mode because controlled diffusive etching varies with nanoparticle
etching from previous reports.41−43

Cu surface, which could be mostly responsible for the formation of
etched Cu patterns.

Conclusions
The
resulting hexagon flower QD-like etched Cu patterns have revealed
a new kind of unknown Euclidean geometry during large-scale CVD graphene
growth. Here, we have established the first observation of etched
Cu patterns on large-scale graphene that can form a new etched hexagon
shape. The experimental results provide clear proof of this etching
mode. Etching to form the hexagon QD-like Cu pattern was induced at
high H2 concentration. This study is expected to be further
computationally and experimentally examined for in situ observation
of integrated graphene etching/growth in the future. This new integrated
growth/etching effect shows an unknown graphene etching mode that
enables other nanomaterial structures to be formed. In addition, further
investigation of the graphene etching mode on new substrates (e.g.,
Ni/W) is another intriguing phenomenon which will be discovered in
the near future.
