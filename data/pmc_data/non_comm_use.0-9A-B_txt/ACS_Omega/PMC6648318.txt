Nitrosobenzene has been demonstrated
to participate in the Mitsunobu
reaction in an analogous manner to dialkyl azodicarboxylates. The
protocol using nitrosobenzene and triphenylphosphine (1:1) under mild
conditions (0 °C) provides the ester derivatives of aliphatic
and aromatic acids using various alcohols in moderate yield and with
good enantioselectivity, giving the desired products predominantly
with an inversion of configuration. The proposed mechanism, which
is analogous to that observed using dialkyl azodicarboxylates, involves
a nitrosobenzene–triphenylphosphine adduct and an alkoxytriphenylphosphonium
ion and was supported by density functional theory calculations, 31P NMR spectroscopy, and experiments conducted with isotopically
labeled substrates.

==== Body
Introduction
The Mitsunobu reaction
(i.e., the reaction of a primary or secondary
alcohol with a pronucleophile mediated by the combination of a trialkyl-
or triarylphosphine (usually PPh3) and dialkyl azodicarboxylate
(DIAD or DEAD)) has been established as one of the most useful tools
in organic synthesis, which allows the effective transformation of
the hydroxy group (Scheme 1A).1 Originally, the method was
developed for the reaction with a carboxylic acid to provide the corresponding
ester.2 Subsequently, many other pronucleophiles
such as phenols or imides were shown to react by an analogous procedure.1b In addition to its mild reaction conditions,
the stereoselectivity was found to be another important aspect of
the Mitsunobu reaction that made it popular for the total synthesis
of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals.1a,3 If a chiral secondary alcohol was used as the substrate, the desired
product usually formed with an inversion of configuration. This property
is inter alia used for the inversion of the configuration of a stereocenter
bearing an OH group, known as “Mitsunobu inversion”
(i.e., a reaction sequence consisting of ester formation followed
by its hydrolysis).4 The dialkyl azodicarboxylate
reagent is involved in the formation of Morrison–Brunn–Huisgen5 betaine I (Scheme 1B), which is reactive enough to convert the
hydroxy group in an alcohol into a good leaving group (triphenylphosphine
oxide).6 In exceptional cases, the hydroxy
group in the carboxylic acid is activated in the same way leading
to an SNAc reaction, which provides a product with retention
of configuration.7

Mitsunobu Esterification (A) and Modes of Triphenylphosphine
Activation with Azo Compounds (B), in the Form of Phosphonium Ylide
(C) and by Nitrosoarene (D)
One of the drawbacks of the Mitsunobu reaction that limits
its
use in large-scale applications is the manipulation of large quantities
of a stoichiometric amount of the dialkyl azodicarboxylate reagent.8 These compounds are high-energy materials that
potentially possess explosive properties. To minimize these problems,
few catalytic systems have been developed for in situ azodicarboxylate
regeneration usually providing esters with the inversion of configuration
with good to high enantioselectivity.9,10 In addition,
azodicarboxylate-free esterification using triphenylphosphine activated
via a one-electron oxidation process has been reported.10e,11 However, these methods mainly lead to carboxylic acid activation
and thus to products with retention of configuration. An alternative
strategy toward improving the Mitsunobu protocol is to replace the
dialkyl azodicarboxylate reagent with a suitable alternative.1b Many reagents have been investigated for this
reason, but most of them are based on an azo-function acting via the
betaine I intermediate. To the best of our knowledge,
with the exception of employing phosphonium ylide II (Scheme 1C)12a,12b or analogous cyanomethylenetrialkylphosphorane12c,12d prepared in advance, there are no other examples of triphenylphosphine
or trialkylphosphine activation in the esterification reaction. Herein,
we report that nitrosobenzene can act as the Mitsunobu reagent as
an alternative to an azo compound to provide esters with similar stereoselectivity
(Scheme 1D).

Results
and Discussion
Investigating various esterification procedures
with model substrates 1a and 2a, we observed
a small amount of ester 3a, which was formed after 20
h in the presence of triphenylphosphine
and nitrosobenzene (Table 1, entry 1). This result inspired us to explore the reaction
in more detail. A preliminary study showed that the most reproducible
results were obtained when the reaction was started by the addition
of a concentrated solution of triphenylphosphine into a stirred tempered
solution of alcohol 1a, acid 2a, and nitrosobenzene
in acetonitrile. The esterification reaction was observed to be rapid;
the composition of the reaction mixture did not change after a time
period of 30 min, and after this time, all triphenylphosphine was
found to be converted to triphenylphosphine oxide either by the productive
(esterification) or nonproductive pathway (see mechanistic studies
below). Thus, the reaction time was reduced to 30 min for the subsequent
experiments. Using Job’s plot, we found that the reaction achieved
the highest conversion of 1a to 3a using
a Ph3P/PhNO ratio of 1:1 (see entries 2–4 and Job’s
plot found in the Supporting Information, Figure S2). The efficiency of the esterification reaction was found
to increase upon diluting the reaction mixture by 1 order of magnitude
(cf. entries 3 and 5). A further decrease in the reaction concentration
caused a significant reduction in the amount of product 3a (entry 6; see the Supporting Information for the plot of conversion
vs concentration, Figure S1). An excess
of both reagents relative to alcohol 1a was found to
be beneficial to the reaction efficiency (cf. entries 5, 7, and 8),
but the effect was rather small when using >2.5 equiv. Finally,
using
the optimal reagent ratio and reaction concentration, we found that
the reaction was better when conducted at 0 °C when compared
to +25 or −25 °C (cf. entries 5, 9, and 10). Solvent alternations
(dichloromethane or toluene) did not improve the reaction toward ester
(see the Supporting Information, Table S2).

Interestingly,
we found that replacing nitrosobenzene with an electron-rich
(1-methoxy-4-nitrosobenzene) or electron-poor aromatic (1-nitroso-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzene)
or aliphatic (2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane) nitroso compound decreased
the reaction efficiency. In addition, using a substituted or aliphatic
analog of triphenylphosphine caused a decrease in the reaction conversion
toward ester 3a (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3). It should be noted that the reaction
conversion to the ester in the absence of either PhNO or Ph3P (blank experiments, see the Supporting Information, Table S1) was <2%. The reaction in the absence
of the acid and alcohol afforded Ph3P=O almost quantitatively,
confirming that an undesired nitrosobenzene deoxygenation reaction
occurs under our optimized reaction conditions, too.13

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we
explored the
substrate scope of the Mitsunobu esterification reaction using nitrosobenzene
(Table 2). Several
types of esters were observed to be formed in moderate to good conversions
and isolated in moderate yields. The substrate scope includes aromatic
and aliphatic acids and benzyl and aliphatic alcohols. In some cases,
esters were obtained in significantly lower yields relative to conversions
(e.g., ester 3e) because of workup. The esterification
reaction tolerates also the nitro group (in ester 3i),
which was described to be deoxygenated by phosphines in some cases.14 The corresponding benzylether was formed in
very small conversions, and a significant amount of ether was obtained
only when the more acidic 4-nitrophenol was used instead of phenol
as the pronucleophile (see Table 2, 3k). Phthalimide provided only a small
amount (3%) of alkylated product (not isolated) by the reaction with
benzyl alcohol.

The stereochemical outcome of the
Mitsunobu reaction is essential.
Thus, we explored our method using chiral, nonracemic substrates (Table 2). With (R)-ethyl lactate ((R)-1f), 3-trifluoromethylbenzoic
acid (2c) gave ester 3n exclusively with
an inversion of configuration. Similarly, when using 1-phenylethanol
((S)-1e or (R)-1e), esters 3l and 3m were formed
upon reaction with both 2c and sterically hindered 2-methyl-2-phenylpropanoic
acid (2f) with a predominant inversion of configuration.
The enantioselectivity of 3l was close to that obtained
using the conventional Mitsunobu reaction (Scheme 2).

Reaction Conditions (with DIAD) and that with PhNO
Conditions: 2c (0.60

Conditions: 2c (0.60 mmol), 1e (0.72 mmol), DIAD (0.90 mmol), Ph3P (0.90 mmol),
acetonitrile (8 mL); 0 °C.

The observed
inversion of configuration was in accordance with
the proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 3A, which involves the activation of the alcohol by
its transformation to alkoxyphosphonium species IV and
an SN2 substitution reaction (Scheme 3A). This mechanism was also supported by
the esterification reaction observed using either 18O-labeled
benzoic acid or benzyl alcohol. The ester containing 18O was only formed when starting from the 18O-labeled acid
(see the Supporting Information, Table S9). Moreover, we observed the formation of alkoxyphosphonium species IV when the reaction was monitored using 31P NMR
spectroscopy recorded at −50 °C (see the Supporting Information, Figure S12).

Nitrene pathway is shaded in gray.

The Mitsunobu reaction with azodicarboxylates has been
previously
studied in detail using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.5a,15 In addition, the mechanism of interaction of trimethylphosphine
(Me3P) with 2-nitrosostyrene has been investigated and
proposed as follows: Me3P attacks the nitrogen atom of
nitrosobenzene forming betaine intermediate IIIa. The
Me3P can migrate to the oxygen atom (forming IIIc) via cyclic oxazaphosphiridine IIIb, the relative energies
of structures being 4.7, 3.4, and −3.4 kcal/mol with respect
to reactants16 (see Scheme 3B). Intermediate IIIc is then
reported to undergo deoxygenation to nitrene.16

We followed the reaction path using exactly the same procedure
and found nitrosobenzene without the vinyl group giving qualitatively
different energetics of the reaction. All three states including the
oxazaphosphiridine ring are of close-lying energies, between −9.1
and −11.8 kcal/mol (Scheme 3C, MeCN single point). The effect of solvent on the
relative stability is enormous (Scheme 3C, MeCN optimization), as can be expected for the species
with significantly different dipole moments. Optimization of geometry
in implicit solvent destabilizes oxazaphosphiridine, leading to spontaneous
opening to the P–O–N structure. Thus, rapid equilibration
of all of the structures IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc is proposed.

The productive step of the Mitsunobu
reaction is the interaction
of III with methanol. The product VI is
composed of alkoxyphosphonium ions (IV) and O-deprotonated
phenylhydroxylamine, creating either a tight ion pair in vacuo or
a separated ion pair when optimized under implicit solvent conditions.
The product VI is energetically comparable to phenylnitrene,
in line with the experimental observation. We did not attempt to locate
the transition state for the reaction, as the role of acid present
in the reaction media could not be modeled without invoking the explicit
solvent models and molecular dynamics simulations.

Combining
our findings with the previously reported energetics
for 2-vinylnitrosobenzene,16 the effect
of substituents on nitrosobenzene seems crucial for the course of
the reaction. The vinyl group is neither a significant electron-donating
nor a significant electron-withdrawing group;17 nevertheless, its presence substantially affects the calculated
energies. The steric effect plays probably a role. It could be speculated
that a well-chosen substituent in a suitable position on the nitrosobenzene
auxiliary would alter the course of the reaction even more toward
the preferred Mitsunobu channel and disfavor the nitrene formation.

Nitrene is known to react smoothly with nitrosobenzene to form
azoxybenzene or it can polymerize.13,18 Indeed, besides
triphenylphosphine oxide, we found azoxybenzene after the reaction
of Ph3P with PhNO (see the Supporting Information, Table S7). We did not detect N-phenylhydroxylamine (V) in the reaction mixture after
the esterification reaction, which can be attributed to its decomposition
under our reaction conditions. We proved this hypothesis in an independent
experiment, which showed that N-phenylhydroxylamine
completely disappeared upon stirring with nitrosobenzene and Ph3P (see the Supporting Information, Table S8). We also checked the N-phenylhydroxylamine
byproduct as a potential substrate for the reaction with benzoic acid,
but we observed the formation of an O-benzyl derivative
in an amount below 1% under our esterification condition.

One
can speculate on the participation of the above-mentioned byproducts
in the esterification reaction. Thus, we performed the reaction between 1a and 2a in the presence of azoxybenzene, azobenzene,
or phenylnitrene (generated from azidobenzene using irradiation with
visible light), but we did not observe the formation of 3a in any of these experiments.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated that a nitroso compound can be
used as an alternative to a dialkyl azodicarboxylate reagent in the
Mitsunobu esterification reaction. Esterification with nitrosobenzene
and triphenylphosphine occurs under very mild reaction conditions
and provides the desired products in moderate yields with good to
excellent enantioselectivity. Although there is a drawback in our
protocol because of the undesired deoxygenation of the reagent (nitrosobenzene),
our system has potential to be optimized by suppressing the side reaction,
e.g., by tuning the nitroso compound structure. Generally, our results
show that compounds containing N=O bonds can be involved in
the activation of triphenylphosphine in addition to the conventional
azo-type compounds. Thus, this study may act as an inspiration and
stimulus toward new alternative Mitsunobu reaction protocols.
