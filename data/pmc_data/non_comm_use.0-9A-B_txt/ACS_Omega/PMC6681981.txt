Many technical challenges
exist in the co-culture of multiple types
of cells, including medium optimization, cell-to-cell connection,
and selective data acquisition of cellular responses. Particularly,
mixed cellular responses limit the precise interpretation of intercellular
signal transduction. Here, we report the formation of an agarose gel
skin on neurons closely assembled with gustatory cells to selectively
stimulate gustatory cells by retarding the diffusion of tastants to
neurons. The signal transmission, triggered by denatonium benzoate,
from gustatory cells to neurons was monitored using intracellular
calcium ion concentrations. The agarose gel skin efficiently suppressed
the direct transfer of tastants to neurons, decreasing the number
of responsive neurons from 56 to 13% and the number of calcium ion
signals per neuron from multiple to single. The assembly of neurons
with gustatory cells induced the high level of neuronal responses
through taste signal transduction from gustatory cells to neurons.
However, the calcium ion signal peaks of free neurons coated with
agarose gel were much shorter and weaker than those of neurons closely
assembled with gustatory cells. This work demonstrated that agarose
gel skin is a simple, fast, and effective means to increase the signal
selectivity of cellular responses in the co-culture of multiple types
of cells.

==== Body
Introduction
Biological tissues
are multicellular structures of different types
of cells that interact with one another to perform tissue-specific
biological functions. Accordingly, in vitro cellular co-culture is
essential for studies in oncology,1 drug
delivery,2 and tissue engineering3 to elucidate the intrinsic behaviors of biological
tissues.4 Cell-to-cell communications in
co-culture models provide valuable information on cellular physiology,
intercellular signaling pathways, and extracellular matrix geometry
and compositions.4−6 For example, tumor growth, metastasis, and phenotypic
changes were studied in the co-culture of cancer and normal cells.1,7 The engulfing and absorbing activities of phagocytes were investigated
in the co-culture of bacteria and phagocytes.8 The co-culture of various cells with neuronal networks is particularly
intriguing because of the abundant interactions of neurons with all
parts of the body.9−13 For instance, the co-culture of keratinocytes and neurons revealed
that heating the skin cells releases adenosine triphosphate as a neurotransmitter
to transfer temperature signals to neurons.9 Neurons were also co-cultured with dental tissues in a biomimetic
microfluidic system to understand the tooth innervation.10 Studies on the co-culture of neurons and cardiac
muscle cells revealed the additional function of the nerve growth
factor that regulates heart beating.11 Due
to the growing interest in a bioelectronic tongue,14,15 the co-culture of neurons with gustatory cells have been also attempted.15−19 A co-culture system mimicking a biological tongue is an essential
step to investigate intrinsic cellular responses to tastants and develop
a cell-based taste biosensor.15,17,18

However, complexity and large variations in multiple cell
populations
generate challenging issues in experimental design and analysis.4,5,20,21 Technical problems associated with the co-culture systems include
medium incompatibility, poor cell-to-cell contact, heterogeneous cell
populations, and a limited period of co-culture.4 Cellular analysis is also complicated by the increasing
quantities of interactions and pathways, diverse and uncertain outcome
prediction, and mixed data attainment. In our recent work, we suggested
that the close self-assembly and co-culture of gustatory cells and
neurons substantially increased intercellular taste signal transmission.18 However, the gustatory cells do not fully cover
the precultured neuronal network, making the neuronal cells directly
exposed to the culture medium and affected by tastants.22,23 Accordingly, calcium influx signals collected from the co-culture
system can be a mixture of responses from the gustatory cells in contact
with neurons and the neurons blindly stimulated by tastants.

In this work, we report a simple method to suppress the direct
stimulation of neurons by tastants in the neuron-gustatory cell co-culture
using an agarose gel coating as a skin cover on the neuron (Figure 1). Low gelling temperature
agarose was employed because of its biocompatibility, flexibility,
and a relatively low gelling point (26–30 °C) for in situ
coatings on the cells. Agarose gel has been widely used for the separation
of biomolecules due to the well-defined mesh size.24,25 The diffusion of small molecules through an agarose gel depends
on molecular size, pore size, and gel–molecule interactions.25,26 We hypothesized that an agarose gel skin efficiently retards the
diffusion of denatonium benzoate, a well-known bitter tastant having
a molecular weight of 446.5 Da, to the underlying neuron. A few micrometer
thick agarose gel was generated to cover the neuronal surface to minimize
undesirable calcium influx signals from the direct stimulation of
neurons. Quantitative analysis on the changes in the cytosolic calcium
ion concentrations was performed to obtain the characteristics of
cellular responses, including the number of peaks per cell, peak amplitude,
and peak density.27,28

Results and Discussion
Effects
of an Agarose Gel Skin on the Neuronal Responses to
Tastants
First, we examined the ability of an agarose gel
skin on neurons in reducing the diffusion of denatonium benzoate as
a bitter tastant into the cells. Low gelling temperature agarose (1
wt %) was melted at 78 °C, cooled down to 38 °C, and applied
onto the neurons to form a gel skin. A thin layer of agarose gel (2.8
or 5.7 μm thick) was generated in situ on the cell culture to
cover the neurons exposed to the medium (Figure S2). Calcium imaging analysis was performed using a Fluo-4
AM, and the fluorescence images were then converted to intensity images
(Figure 2). Time-lapse
recordings of neuronal cells treated with denatonium without and with
the agarose gel skin visualized the number of responding cells and
the number of calcium signals per responding cell (Supporting Information, Movies S1–S3). The agarose gel skin clearly decreased both of the variables.
Bare neurons were also treated with HBSS without denatonium as a negative
control (Movie S4). The result indicates
that neurons were not significantly affected by the additional buffer.
Time-dependent fluorescence intensity spectra of randomly selected
cells marked in intensity images revealed that the agarose gel skin
significantly decreased the number of signal peaks per cell from multiple
peaks to a single peak in 5 min, increased the peak width, and decreased
the peak amplitude (Figure 2B, E, and H, respectively). The signals were also slightly
delayed as compared to those from the cells without the agarose gel
skin. The cropped images of selected cells at some time points exhibit
the relative intensity of signals compared to the intensity at the
nonstimulated state, which is directly related to the change in intracellular
calcium ion concentration (Figure 2C, F, and I). The results confirm that the agarose
gel skin can limit the diffusion and direct contact of bitter tastants
to neuronal cells, resulting in much fewer signals with delayed, weak,
and slow responses. To investigate the diffusion rate of denatonium
through the agarose layer, we performed a diffusion test using a Franz
cell (Figure S3). The flux of denatonium
through the agarose gel was only 13.3 ng cm–2 s–1, corresponding to the penetration of only 2.5% denatonium
for 8 min through the agarose gel with a thickness of 5 μm.

benzoate (A–C) without and (D–F) with the 2.8 μm
thick and (G–I) 5.7 μm thick agarose gel skins. First
frames of 5 min recordings with the location of selected cells as
marked with numbers (A, D, and G), fluorescence intensities (B, E,
and H), and captured images of the randomly selected cells (C, F,
and I).

Next, the obtained signal spectra
were quantitatively analyzed
as shown in Figure 3. Each dot represents the value from a single cell. The number of
multiple peaks decreased sharply from 12% in Neuron-1 (without the
agarose gel skin) to 3% in Neuron-2 (with 2.8 μm thick agarose)
and 0% in Neuron-3 (with 5.7 μm thick agarose). The number of
single peaks per cell also decreased from 43% (Neuron-1) to 19% (Neuron-2)
and 13% (Neuron-3). Especially, the number of cells that did not respond
to the tastant (0 peak) increased from 44% (Neuron-1) to 78% (Neuron-2)
and 87% (Neuron-3) (Figure 3A). These data indicate that the agarose gel skin substantially
suppressed the stimulation of neurons by the tastants. Other parameters
of the signal peaks of the responsive cells are also shown in Figure 3B–E. The starting
time point of signaling showed a slight delay of the responses (Figure 3B); however, the
statistical p-value suggested that the differences
were not significant. The duration of signaling was slightly shorter
when the agarose gel skin was used (Figure 3C), but the differences were not significant.
The broader peak’s width indicated the slower speed of signaling
(Figure 3D), which
is more significant with 5.7 μm of agarose (Neuron-3). The longer
periodicity of peaks in Neuron-2 revealed a longer rest time between
signals, which also indicates slower and fewer cellular responses
in the presence of the agarose gel skin. Neuron-2 exhibited a much
longer periodicity than Neuron-1, while Neuron-3 did not exhibit multiple
peaks. Neuron-2 also exhibited a significantly decreased peak amplitude
than Neuron-1, which indicated weaker responses of the cells under
the agarose gel skin (Figure 3F). Note that the data in Figure 3B–F are based only on the responsive
cells, so the number of dots for each sample is different: 56, 22,
and 13% of the responding cells in Neuron-1, Neuron-2, and Neuron-3
in Figure 3A, respectively.
Overall, the data analysis of signal fluorescence spectra further
confirmed that the agarose gel skin can limit the direct contact and
activation of tastants to neuron cells, increasing the number of nonresponding
cells and reducing some signal characteristics of responsive cells
including signal’s speed, periodicity, and amplitude.

(Neuron-1) and with the agarose gel skin (Neuron-2 and Neuron-3 for

Effects of the Agarose
Gel Skin on Calcium Ion Responses in
the Neuron-Gustatory Cell Co-Culture
The proximate self-assembly
of neuronal and gustatory cells was performed using a pair of complimentary
DNA-PEG-lipid conjugates anchored to each type of cells as described
in our recent report.18 The DNA-PEG-lipid
conjugates were synthesized by the sequential conjugation of Mal-PEG24-NHS to DPPE and single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN).
The ssODN sequences were (GTCA)5 and (TGAC)5 that can be hybridized with each other. When gustatory cells were
self-assembled with the neuronal network through the hybridization
of complementary ssODN strands, three different cell types exist in
the co-culture: gustatory cells in contact with neuronal cells (GN), neuronal cells in contact with gustatory cells (NG), and nonassembled neuronal cells exposed to the culture medium
(N). The signal transmissions among the three cell types became more
complicated than those of the single culture of neurons because all
types of the cells can be directly stimulated by tastants, and the
signals are transferred to the neighboring cells (Figure S4). However, to simplify our interpretation, we presumed
that the calcium signal decreases and eventually becomes negligible
when transferred through cell-to-cell communications, allowing us
to limit the scope of analysis to the second transmission. To determine
the source of the signal, we stained the cells with CM-Dil and Blue
CMAC dyes for neurons and gustatory cells, respectively (Figure 4). The overlap images
of two-color channels show pinky spots where neurons and gustatory
cells were closely assembled by DNA hybridization. Though gustatory
and neuronal cells were successfully assembled, not all of the neurons
were fully covered (Figure 4C). Inevitably, some parts of the neuronal cell body were
exposed to the testing medium where tastants were added (Figure S4A).

and neuronal cells
after 3 day co-culture. Gustatory and neuronal cells were stained
with (A) CellTracker Blue CMAC and (B) CM-Dil, respectively. (C) Merged
image of the two channels.

The calcium influx signal of our interest is the one transferred
from gustatory cells to neurons, so all of the signals from the direct
stimulation of neuronal cells need to be minimized. To suppress the
direct stimulation of neurons by tastants, we applied a 5.7 μm
thick agarose gel skin layer on the co-cultured cells (Figure S4A). The agarose gel skin was expected
to prevent the direct neuronal stimulation while allowing the major
body part of gustatory cells exposed to the culture medium (Figures S4B and S5). The calcium influx imaging
analysis was then performed with the addition of 1 mM denatonium benzoate
to the co-culture without and with the agarose gel skin. The time-lapse
recordings of intensity images exhibit the decreased signals when
the agarose gel skin was employed (Movies S5 and S6). Intensity images and location
of some analyzed cells are shown in Figure 5A,D. Time-course fluorescence spectra of
the corresponding cells clearly show the decreased number of signal
peaks per cell and the delayed response starting point (Figure 5B,E). The difference in the
fluorescence magnitude is also represented for one cell as an example
in Figure 5C,F. We
also performed the calcium influx imaging analysis only for gustatory
cells (Figures S6 and S7 and Movie S7) to examine the effects of the self-assembly
of gustatory cells with the neuronal network on their responses to
tastants. The difference in the signal’s characteristics of
gustatory cells in single culture and co-culture was negligible except
for the width of signal peaks (Figure S8). The widths of signals from gustatory in co-culture were smaller
than that in single culture, indicated that the signals from gustatory
cells became faster when it was transmitted to neuronal cells. The
results indicate that the changes in the calcium ion responses of
gustatory cells to tastants in the co-cultured cells are ascribed
to the effects of the agarose gel skin on the diffusivity of tastants.

imaging of gustatory-neuron co-culture treated with 1 mM
denatonium benzoate (A–C) without and (D–F) with an
agarose gel skin of 5.7 μm thick. First frames of 5 min recordings
with the location of selected cells as marked with numbers (A, D),
fluorescence spectra (B, E), and captured images (C, F) of the selected
cells.

The cellular responses were quantitatively
analyzed as summarized
in Figure 6. Gustatory
cells without and with the agarose gel skin exhibited similar signal
characteristics in all of the investigated parameters with no significant
difference in mean values. The neurons (N) that were not self-assembled
with gustatory cells showed a significantly shorter duration of signaling
when covered by the agarose gel skin (Figure 6C). The mean durations of signaling were
97 and 60 s without and with the agarose gel skin, respectively. The
nonassembled neurons under the agarose gel skin also had significantly
smaller peak widths and lower peak amplitudes (Figure 6D,F). The results suggest that, under the
agarose gel skin, the nonassembled neurons in the co-culture received
only secondary signals transmitted from nearby neurons in contact
with gustatory cells. In addition, the number of transmitted routes
was reduced due to the limitation of direct activation of tastants
to the exposed neuronal cell body (Figures S4). No significant difference was found in the start-point of the
first signal of nonassembled neurons.

(C) duration of signaling of a cell, (D) average value of full width
at half-maximum of signal peaks of a cell, (E) periodicity of signaling,
and (F) signal peak’s amplitude of a cell. Black bars indicate
mean values.

The calcium influx signals
from the assembled neurons (NG) under the agarose gel skin
exhibit no delay effect (similar start-point
of the first signal) (Figure 6B). The peak width and strength were also very similar (Figure 6D,F). However, the
number of signal peaks per cell was clearly decreased (Figure 6A), which indicates that the
self-assembled neurons received signals only from the gustatory cells
rather than the nearby neurons that were not directly activated by
tastants. They also had a significantly shorter duration of signaling
(Figure 6C), suggesting
that the signals were transferred one way only, from the gustatory
cells to the assembled neurons and possibly to the connected nearby
neurons, while there was no other source coming back to increase the
signaling. The significantly shorter periodicity of NG signals
(Figure 6E) and the
shorter duration (Figure 6C) indicate that the cells responded to the tastants in a
shorter time period. The quantitative analysis suggests that the undesired
signaling from the direct activation of neuronal cells by tastants
were successfully suppressed by the agarose gel skin.

Conclusions
In this work, we successfully demonstrated that the application
of a thin agarose gel skin onto the gustatory-neuron cell co-culture
allows the selective stimulation of gustatory cells for taste signal
transmission to neurons. The agarose gel skin was able to suppress
the direct stimulation of neurons by tastants: the number of nonresponding
cells was significantly increased, while the number of signals per
cell was drastically reduced. The application of the agarose gel skin
to the self-assembled gustatory cell-neuron co-culture increased the
selectivity of taste stimuli by reducing the direct contact of tastants
to nonassembled neuronal cells. While the agarose gel skin did not
change the cellular responses of gustatory cells, the neuronal network
self-assembled with gustatory cells exhibited much fewer and shorter
calcium influx signals. The result indicates that the self-assembled
neurons obtained signals through intercellular signal transmission.
The nonassembled neurons in the co-culture exhibited much weaker and
early terminated signals, suggesting that they received only the secondary
transmission from the neighboring neurons assembled with gustatory
cells. Overall, the agarose gel skin was able to effectively suppress
the direct taste stimuli on neuron cells in the co-culture of gustatory-neurons,
improving the selectivity of calcium signal collection.

Primary Culture of Neurons and Gustatory
Cells
For
the neuronal cell culture, culture dishes were precoated with PDL
(0.1 mg mL–1) for 2 h and laminin (10 μg mL–1) for 1 h at room temperature. The culture medium
for neuronal cells, denoted by “NM”, was DMEM/F12 with
1× N2, 0.5× B27, and 1 vol % P/S. Hippocampus tissues were
taken from the brains of embryos of SD-RAT (TP18) and digested at
37 °C for 15 min in a mixture of 100 mL of 0.5% T/E and 900 mL
of HBSS. The tissues were then washed with HBSS and dissociated gently
in the medium. Neuron cells were then plated in the dish at a density
of 2 × 105 cells cm–2 and incubated
at 37 °C in humid air containing 5% CO2.

For
the gustatory cell culture, culture dishes were precoated with 0.2
mg mL–1 collagen in 0.02 N acetic acid at room temperature
for 2 h. The culture medium for gustatory cells, denoted by “GM”,
was DMEM/F12 with 1× N2, 0.5× B27, 1 vol % P/S, and 100
ng mL–1 EGF. Tongue tissues of 2 day old neonatal
mice were collected, washed, chopped into tiny pieces, and then submerged
in a digestion solution (100 μL of 0.5% T/E, 980 μL of
accutase, 40 μL of DNase I, and 880 μL of HBSS). The tongue
tissues were digested at 37 °C for 15 min and washed with a trypsin
inhibitor solution (1 mg mL–1 in HBSS) and HBSS.
The tissues were plated in the collagen-coated dish and incubated
at 37 °C in humid air (5% CO2) for 5 days before the
first passage. To sort and select gustatory cells, we washed away
death cells, and only attached and migrated cells were collected using
0.25% T/E and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition
of trypsin inhibitors. The cells were separated from tissues using
a cell strainer (70 μm), centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min), resuspended
in GM, and seeded in the collagen-coated culture dish. Gustatory cells
were further incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2, humid air)
for 3 days. The experimental schedule is summarized in the Supporting
Information (Figure S1).

Synthesis of
ssODN-PEG-DPPE
ssODN-PEG-DPPE was synthesized
as previously reported.18 Thiol-modified
ssODN was conjugated to DPPE using NHS-dPEG24-Mal as a
linker. The reaction was performed in dichloromethane with a trace
amount of trimethylamine for 72 h at room temperature with magnetic
stirring; then, the product was purified three times by precipitation
in chilled diethyl ether and vacuum filtration. Finally, the product,
DPPE-dPEG24-Mal, was freeze-dried and stored at −25
°C until use. The thiol group of ssODN was activated by TCEP
for 30 min, followed by the addition of sodium acetate. The ssODN
was purified twice by adding absolute ethanol, chilled at −70
°C for precipitation, centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min, and
then air-dried. The conjugation of ssODN to DPPE-dPEG24-Mal was performed at a concentration of 1 mM with magnetic stirring
for 12 h. 10× HBSS was then added to prepare a 1× salt concentration
of ssODN-PEG-DPPE.

Fluorescence Labeling of Gustatory and Neuronal
Cells
To distinguish the signal source, we fluorescently
labeled gustatory
cells and neurons with CellTracker Blue CMAC and CM-Dil dyes, respectively.
The attached neuronal and gustatory cells on the dishes were washed
with HBSS, and the dye solutions (5:1000 diluted for CM-Dil and 1:1000
diluted for Blue CMAC in HBSS) were added to the cells separately.
The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed
with HBSS.

DNA-Mediated Cellular Assembly
The
ssODN modification
of neurons and gustatory cells was performed using the synthesized
ssODN-PEG-DPPE. The neurons and gustatory cells were incubated with
ssODN-PEG-DPPE carrying the sequences of GTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCA and
TGACTGACTGACTGACTGAC, respectively, at 37 °C for 30 min. The
unbound ssODN-PEG-DPPE was washed out thoroughly with HBSS. Then,
DNA-mediated cellular assembly was performed using stained ssODN-anchored
neurons and gustatory cells as follows. The gustatory cells were detached
from the dish by incubating in 0.05% T/E at 37 °C for 5 min,
followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitors, centrifugation (1000
rpm, 5 min), and resuspension in GM. The gustatory cells (5 ×
104 cell cm–2) were counted and seeded
on neurons (2 × 105 cell cm–2),
followed by the addition of GM. The dish was incubated at 37 °C
with shaking at 100 rpm for 30 min to allow the hybridization of DNA.
Then, the unbounded gustatory cells were washed out thoroughly using
HBSS, and fresh GM was added. The co-culture system was incubated
for 3 days at 37 °C in humid air containing 5% CO2 to stabilize the intercellular connections.

Fluorescence Imaging of
Intracellular Calcium Ions
The assembled gustatory-neuronal
cells were coated with a thin skin
of agarose gel on top of the co-cultured cells. Low gelling temperature
agarose was completely dissolved in HBSS at 1 wt % around 78 °C,
and then the solution was maintained at 38 °C until use. The
cells were first stained with 1 μg mL–1 Fluo-4
AM in a mixture of 10 μL of 100× PowerLoad and 1 mL of
1× HBSS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by washing in
HBSS. To allow the stable flow of the viscous agarose solution on
the cell surface, we kept the dish warm at 37 °C by placing it
on a heating plate and added the predetermined amount of agarose solution
onto the cells slowly. After 2 min, the dish was removed from the
heating plate and placed at room temperature to allow the gelation
of agarose. HBSS was then added, and the cells were stabilized for
15 min. Then, denatonium benzoate in HBSS was added to the cells at
a final concentration of 1 mM. The fluorescence intensity of the cells
was determined by a fluorescence microscope (DMI 3000B, Leica, USA).
Time-lapse images were taken for 5 min at an interval of 2 s using
a filter with an excitation band pass of 450–490 nm and an
emission long pass of 515 nm. Fluorescence images of Blue CMAC-stained
gustatory cells and CM-Dil-stained neurons were also taken using a
filter with excitation band passes of 340–380 nm and 515–560
nm, respectively.

Data Analysis of Calcium Signal Spectra
Cells were
randomly selected from the time-lapse images for analysis as a region
of interest (ROI). Over 50 cells were analyzed for neurons and gustatory
cells, and over 100 cells were analyzed for the assembled neuron-gustatory
cells. The mean fluorescence intensity of each selected cells was
determined by the microscope-integrated software Leica Application
Suite (Leica Microsystem CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Intensity images
and movies were converted from the time-lapse recording using Fiji
(NIH, Maryland, USA). Analysis parameters in the fluorescence spectra
were collected from Baseline and Peaks function in the software OriginPro
8 (OriginLab Corp., MA, USA). Nonparametric statistical analysis was
performed by the calculation of p-value for the significant
differences with p < 0.1.
