Blends of alkali
lignin and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
(ABS) resin are physically mixed and injected into the injection molding
system. Although the components of the blend are bound together by
intermolecular forces, noticeable phase separation still occurs. In
the present study, inverse gas chromatography technology was used
to characterize the Hansen solubility parameters of alkali lignin/ABS
blends. The relationship between the Hansen solubility parameters
and thermodynamic properties was then determined. Hansen solubility
parameters, at room temperature, of alkali lignin/ABS blends containing
0, 10, 20, and 30 wt % alkali lignin were 17.40, 19.20, 18.98, and
17.37 (J/cm3)0.5, respectively. Hansen solubility
parameters of the blends were shown, both experimentally and theoretically,
to be related to their mechanical and thermal properties.

Introduction
Lignin is an important renewable biomass,
second in abundance only
to cellulose.1,2 Lignin regenerates at a rate of
about 150 billion tons per year and approximately 50 million tons
of lignin byproducts are obtained from the pulp and paper industries.3,4 However, only 1–2% of lignin produced annually is used for
the production of value-added products and most lignin is burned for
energy.5,6 Lignin has a complicated three-dimensional
reticular structure, incorporating a variety of active functional
groups, such as phenol and methoxy groups, which confer advantages
including lack of toxicity and degradability .7−9 The −OH
groups in lignin can form strong intermolecular interactions with
other polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide), poly(4-vinylpyridine),
polyaniline, and phenolic resin,10−14 and these blends may have improved compatibility
and properties. Lignin has also been used to improve the thermal oxidation
stability and flame retardancy of polymers, particularly polyolefins,
such as polyethylene and polypropylene.15−18 Most polymers are, however, immiscible,
or only partly miscible, with lignin because of low entropy of mixing.10 Polymer blends provide a convenient approach
for combining the useful properties of two or more polymers and miscibility
occurs if the polymers form strong intermolecular interactions, such
as hydrogen bonds and acid–base interactions.19 Fuller utilization of lignin would significantly benefit
the papermaking and biofuel industries.20

Acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) resin
is an
important engineering thermoplastic that is widely used in the manufacture
of automobiles, electronic appliances, light industrial appliances
and textiles, and in the construction industry, because of its balanced
mechanical properties, chemical resistance, ease of processing, and
recyclability.21,22 ABS composites modified by lignin
can improve defects of ABS to achieve target performance and favorable
environmental impacts such as flame retardancy and carbon emission
reduction and are acceptable for automotive use and other emerging
industries such as the automotive side panel.23,24 Chains of ABS resin, which contain aromatic structures and strongly
polar −CN groups, are similar in structure to lignin, suggesting
that the resin may have good interfacial compatibility with lignin.
Blending ABS with lignin would make use of lignin and reduce costs,
and would concurrently render the ABS nonflammable and partially biodegradable.

Although lignin has been widely used as a raw material to prepare
lignin-based blends and composites, these materials had obvious problems
with phase separation or incompatibility of the interface.19,25 Because the compatibility between two polymers affects the morphology
and mechanical properties of the blend or composite, improving the
thermodynamic compatibility between the components can prevent coalescence
or phase separation during manufacture and use, and thus improve the
performance of products.26,27 The interface compatibility
of blends has typically been studied by characterization from the
viewpoint of the chemical structure, by using the change of thermal
and mechanical properties to speculate about the mutual relationship
between the two components, or by using the swelling method to analyze
qualitatively the interaction between the two components.28,29 Quantitative characterization of blends of ABS and alkali lignin
is, however, lacking and few studies have provided a quantitative
representation of the interactions between the two components and
the relationship with their properties.30

The Hansen solubility parameter plays an important role in
predicting
and improving the compatibility of blends. Inverse gas chromatography
(IGC) has been widely used to measure various physical and chemical
parameters of polymers, and to determine solubility and interaction
parameters.31−34 This technique has proved to be a rapid, direct, and sensitive method
for measuring Hansen solubility parameters of polymers and has also
been used to measure the compatibility of polymer blends.35−40 In our earlier paper, we had studied quantitatively the polar system
of lignin/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites.30 To further verify and expand the validity and applicability
of the research, the nonpolar system of lignin/ABS blends will be
investigated and analyzed. Alkali lignin/ABS blends were injected
by the melt blending method and Hansen solubility parameters of the
blends were measured by IGC. The correlation between mechanical and
thermal properties and Hansen solubility parameters of alkali lignin/ABS
blends was then studied quantitatively to provide a theoretical basis
for the selection and design of technological parameters of ABS/lignin
blends.

Results and Discussion
Retention Volumes of Probe Solvents
Special retention
volumes were calculated according to the following equation 1  where tr and to are the retention
time of the probe solvent
and the retention of n-pentane, respectively; F, m, and T are the flow
rate under ambient conditions, the mass of stationary phase, and the
column temperature, respectively. The factor J is
calculated using following equation 2  where Pi and P0 are the
inlet and outlet pressure, respectively.35

The specific retention volumes of 20 probe
solvents on different alkali lignin/ABS blends were determined over
the temperature range 383.15–423.15 K (Table 1). Vg0 values decreased with increasing
temperature for all probe solvents. Retention diagrams, in which ln Vg0 was plotted versus 1/T, for selected probe solvents
are shown in Figure 1. The retention diagrams were linear, indicating that there was no
phase change in the blends over the temperature range studied. The
retention of the probe solvent was, therefore, mainly attributable
to adsorption on the solid surface of the alkali lignin/ABS blend.

Hansen Solubility Parameter
The determination of the
solubility parameter of alkali lignin/ABS blends by the following
equation 3  where δ1 and δ2 are the probe solvent and the stationary phase of the Hansen
solubility parameter, respectively. χ12∞ and χs∞ are the interaction parameter
and the entropy components, respectively.35 χ12∞ is calculated by following equation 4  where M1, R, B11, P10, and V1 are the molecular mass
of the probe solvent, the gas
constant, the second virial coefficient, the saturated vapor pressure,
and the molar volume of the probe solvent, respectively.35

The correlation of left-hand part and
δ1 was obtained using eq 3 and is shown in Figure 2. Hansen solubility parameters of alkali
lignin/ABS blends, δ2, were calculated by different
slopes at 383.15, 393.15, 403.15, 413.15, and 423.15 K, and calculations
are shown in Table 2. As seen from the table, the solubility parameters decreased linearly
with the increase of temperature. Hansen solubility parameters of
alkali lignin/ABS blends with alkali lignin contents of 0, 10, 20,
and 30% were 17.40, 19.10, 18.98, and 17.37 (J/cm3)0.5 at 298.15 K, respectively.

Dispersion of the Lignin
in ABS Resin
The SEM micrographs
of ABS resin and alkali lignin/ABS blends are shown in Figure 3, and a typical microphase-separation
structure like a “sea-island” was observed easily. As
shown in Figure 3,
alkali lignin was uniformly dispersed in the ABS resin matrix, and
the interfaces of blends were fuzzy when a little amount of lignin
was added. What is more, alkali lignin/ABS blends had smooth surfaces
(Figure 8) and the
Hansen solubility parameter also increased when the amount of alkali
lignin was 10%. The addition of more lignin (20 and 30%) caused the
surface to become slightly rougher (Figure 8), and many larger lignin domains and visible
interfaces appeared (Figure 3), which suggested that alkali lignin readily agglomerated
because of limited interfacial compatibility between alkali lignin
and the ABS resin matrix. Bad compatibility also led to the decreasing
of the Hansen solubility parameter.

matrix, (B) ABS-10, (C)
ABS-20, and (D) ABS-30.

Quantitative Characterization of the Hansen Solubility Parameter
and Tensile Strength of Alkali Lignin/ABS Blends
The mechanical
properties of blends with different proportions of alkali lignin were
evaluated. The trends of tensile strength and elongation at break
are shown in Figure 4. When a larger amount of lignin was added to the polymer, compatibility
and homogenization were very important. As the amount of alkali lignin
increased, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the blends
decreased gradually, indicating poor compatibility of the phase interface
between the ABS resin and alkali lignin and which was attributed to
structural and other properties. Although the components of alkali
lignin/ABS blends can develop dispersion forces and π electron
interactions because of the aromatic rings, these interaction forces
are weak, resulting in weak bonding forces between the two phases.
In the testing process, the lignin is easy to pull out from the ABS
resin, as a result, the tensile strength and elongation at break of
composites are poor. Additionally, self-interactions among lignin
molecules are very strong because of the large number of polar functional
groups in the molecule. These self-interactions lead to uneven distribution
of lignin in the blends. Increasing the amount of alkali lignin in
the blend is more likely to cause stress concentration and cracks
in the interface.

Figure 4 Effect of different proportions of alkali lignin on δ2 and tensile strength and elongation at break.

The correlation between the Hansen solubility parameter
and tensile
strength was characterized quantitatively and satisfied the variation
tendency of quadratic function shown in Figure 5. The correlation of two parameters fitted
the binomial relationship Y = −28.65691 +
1.11229X – (6.480 × 10–3)X2 (69.57 ≤ X ≤ 101.95), where X and Y are the tensile strength and the Hansen solubility parameter of
the blend, respectively. The correlation coefficient was 0.99929.
The significance of difference derived from regression model fitting
was checked by ANOVA, and values of F = 2115.952
and p = 0.015 < 0.05 were obtained, indicating
that X significantly impacted Y and
that R2 was statistically significant.
There was, therefore, a significant relationship between the Hansen
solubility parameter and the tensile strength of the blend.

Figure 5 Tensile strength
vs solubility parameter (δ2)
of alkali lignin/ABS blends.

Two parameters of blends containing 5 and 25% alkali lignin
were
determined to check the validity of the regression model. Hansen solubility
parameters of blends containing 5 and 25% alkali lignin were 19.20
and 17.49 (J/cm3)0.5, respectively, and values
of tensile strength were 90.08 and 71.68 MPa, respectively (red dots
in Figure 5). The values
measured roughly satisfied the regression model.

Quantitative
Characterization of the Hansen Solubility Parameter
and Thermal Weight Loss Temperature of Alkali Lignin/ABS Blends
As the proportion of alkali lignin in the blend increased, the
temperature at which thermal weight loss started gradually decreased,
likely because of evaporation of low-molecular weight substances in
the alkali lignin (Figure 6 and Table 3). The mass retention rate of ABS resin at 600 °C was <1%,
indicating that the ABS resin was almost completely oxidized and decomposed
at this temperature. However, when alkali lignin was added, the mass
retention rate at 700 °C was >7%. Alkali lignin had a noticeable
effect on char-formation and improved the flame retardancy of materials.

and differential scanning calorimetry curves
of alkali lignin/ABS blends.

Table 3 Effect of Lignin Content on Thermal
Weight Loss Temperature of Alkali Lignin/ABS Blends
proportion of alkali lignin (%)	0	10	20	30	
thermal
weight loss temperature (°C)	320	246	238	217	
When the proportion of alkali lignin in the
blend was 10%, the
thermal decomposition temperature was 419 °C. This was higher
than 412 °C, the thermal decomposition temperature of ABS, and
was the highest thermal decomposition temperature of all the blends.
These results showed that the addition of alkali lignin to ABS resin
improved its thermal stability. When the proportion of alkali lignin
was 10%, the Hansen solubility parameter of the blend was also the
largest, indicating that thermal stability could be predicted indirectly
by the Hansen solubility parameter.

According to Tables 2 and 3, correlation between the Hansen solubility
parameter and thermal weight loss temperature was characterized quantitatively
and satisfied the variation tendency of quadratic function shown in Figure 7. The correlation
of two parameters fitted the binomial relationship Y = −41.07127 + 0.45218X – (8.42 ×
10–4)X2 (217 ≤ X ≤ 320), where X and Y are the thermal weight loss temperature and the Hansen solubility
parameter of the blend, respectively. The correlation coefficient
was 0.968. The significance of difference derived from regression
model fitting was checked by ANOVA, and values of F = 46.467 and p = 0.103 were obtained, indicating
that there is a very slightly nonsignificant difference.

Figure 7 Solubility
parameter (δ2) vs thermal weight loss
temperature of the alkali lignin/ABS blend.

Two parameters of blends containing 5 and 25% alkali lignin
were
determined to check the validity of the regression model. Thermal
weight loss temperatures of blends with alkali lignin content of 5
and 25% were 291 and 310 °C, respectively (Figure 7). The values measured roughly satisfied
the regression model.

Conclusions
Hansen solubility parameters
and properties of blends with different
proportions alkali lignin have been measured, and the correlation
between them has also been analyzed quantitatively. Regression models
satisfy the variation tendency of quadratic function and has a significant
relationship, which is similar with regression models of the polar
system of alkali lignin/PVA membranes.30 What is more, the Hansen solubility parameter increases first and
then decreases with the increasing tensile strength and thermal weight
loss temperature, providing a reliable basic for on-demand design
and performance improvement of ABS/lignin blends.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Commercial alkali lignin was supplied by
Tralin Paper Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China).30 Alkali lignin was mixed with 0.1 M NaOH, and insoluble material
was removed by filtration. HCl (2 M) was added to the filter liquor
until the pH value of the liquor fell to 2. The resulting precipitate
was removed by filtration, and the filter cake was then washed with
distilled water to neutral, dried for 24 h under vacuum, ground to
a powder, and set aside. ABS was supplied by Sinopec Sichuan Vinylon
Works (Changshou, China), and probe solvents were obtained from Aladdin
Industrial Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).30

Admeasurement of the Hansen Solubility Parameter by IGC
Hansen solubility parameters were determined by an Agilent 6890N
gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped
with a flame ionization detector. The injector and detector were operated
at 200 °C. High purity nitrogen was used as the carrier gas,
and the nitrogen flow rate was maintained at 20 mL/min. Solvent-rinsed
stainless steel chromatography columns (2000 mm, 1/8 in O.D.) were
packed with Chromosorb 6201 that had been coated with mixtures of
alkali lignin and ABS using concentrated acetone solutions. The columns
packed were treated at 130 °C for about 8 h by gas chromatography.
Probe solvents were injected by a 0.5 μL special syringe to
measure retention times at 383.15, 393.15, 403.15, 413.15, and 423.15
K. Each solute probe was injected at least three times, and the average
retention time, tr, was used to calculate
Hansen solubility parameters of the alkali lignin/ABS blends.

Preparation
of Alkali Lignin/ABS Blends
ABS resin particles
were ground to a 100 mesh powder using a small pulverizer. Alkali
lignin was then added to the ABS powder to provide blends with 10,
20, and 30 wt % alkali lignin. The blends were molded into test samples
(Figure 8), following the standards set out in GB/T1040-92.
Briefly, the blends were injected into a HAAKE MiniJet Pro piston
injection molding system (Thermo Electron Corporation, Karlsruhe,
Germany), using an injection pressure of 55 MPa. The blend was then
retained in the cylinder for 6 s at a pressure of 45 MPa. The temperatures
of the cylinder and cavity were 200 and 50 °C, respectively.

SEM Testing
The TM3030 scanning electron microscope
(TM3030, Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the dispersion and compatibility
of alkali lignin in the ABS matrix on the fractured surfaces of samples
at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.

Test of Mechanical Properties
of Alkali Lignin/ABS Blends
The mechanical properties of
the alkali lignin/ABS blends were
measured according to the standards set out in GB/T 1040.2-2006. The
samples were treated according to GB/T 2918-1998. Tensile strength
of blends was tested by a universal testing machine (LDX-200, Beijing
Landmark Packaging Material Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at a speed
of 50 mm/min, and an average of five measurements was recorded for
each sample.

Test of Thermal Properties of Alkali Lignin/ABS
Blends
Samples were analyzed using a Q50 thermogravimetric
analyzer (TA
Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) over the temperature range 25–800
°C, with a scanning rate of 10 °C/min and a nitrogen flow
rate of 10 mL/min. Then, samples were then analyzed using a Q20 differential
scanning calorimeter (TA Instruments) over the temperature range 25–300
°C, with a scanning rate of 10 °C/min and a nitrogen flow
rate of 10 mL/min.
