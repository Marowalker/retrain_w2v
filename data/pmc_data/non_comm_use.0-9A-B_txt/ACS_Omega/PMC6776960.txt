Hybrid perovskite materials have
drawn a remarkable attention for
approaching high-performance photovoltaics owing to their superior
optoelectronic properties. But most of research studies focused on
the pristine hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. In this study, we utilize a newly developed CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, where Pb2+ is partially
substituted by a heterovalent Nd3+ cation, as the photoactive
layer for solution-processed perovskite photodetectors. It is found
that the resultant CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film
possesses superior thin film morphology, enhanced and balanced charge
carrier mobilities, and suppressed trap density, resulting in enhanced
photocurrent and reduced dark current for perovskite photodetectors
by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film. Thus,
operated at room temperature, solution-processed perovskite photodetectors
exhibit over 1014 cm Hz1/2 W–1 photodetectivity in a spectrum range from 350 to 800 nm, a linear
dynamic range over 100 dB, and fast response time. All these results
indicate that high-performance solution-processed perovskite photodetectors
can be realized by novel hybrid perovskite materials, where Pb2+ is partially substituted by heterovalent Nd3+ cations.

Introduction
In the past 10 years, studies found that
hybrid perovskite materials
possess high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion
length, and low density of defects and traps.1−4 Such superior optoelectronic properties
contributed perovskite solar cells with an efficiency over 23% from
3.8% rapidly.5−11 Impressive photocurrent and restricted dark current were realized
in perovskite photovoltaics, which strongly suggested that hybrid
perovskite materials are promising alternatives for fabrication ultrasensitive
photodetectors (PDs). In 2014, Dou et al. reported perovskite PDs
with an inverted device structure.11 In
early 2015, we reported ultrasensitive solution-processed perovskite
PDs.12 Further studies found that perovskite
PDs exhibited a wide spectrum response range, high detectivity, and
fast response.11−16 However, most of studies were focused on the pristine perovskite,
methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3).11−16 Recently, we reported a novel CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (where x is the nominal ratio) thin film, where Pb2+ was partially
substituted by a heterovalent neodymium (Nd3+) cation,
and found out that the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ thin film exhibited superior film
quality with significantly improved charge carrier mobilities and
highly suppressed trap states.17 We further
demonstrated highly reproducible power conversion efficiency from
inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells by the Nd3+-doped perovskite as the photoactive layer.17

In this study, we report ultrahigh detectivity solution-processed
perovskite PDs by CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+, where Pb2+ is partially substituted
by the heterovalent Nd3+ cation. It is found that by partially
substitution of Pb2+ by the heterovalent Nd3+ cation, the resultant CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol
%) thin film possesses superior film morphology, enhanced and balanced
charge carrier mobilities, and suppressed trap density, resulting
in enhanced photocurrent and reduced dark current for perovskite PDs
by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ thin film. Thus, operated at room temperature, perovskite
PDs exhibit over 1014 cm Hz1/2 W–1 photodetectivity in a spectrum range from 350 to 800 nm, a linear
dynamic range over 100 dB, and fast response time.

Results and Discussion
For the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, the partial
substitution of Pb2+ by Nd3+ was confirmed by
the binding energy shifts of N 1s, I 3d, and Pb 4f in X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopies (XPS) of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ thin films.17 Thin film
characteristics including the crystal structure, film morphology,
charge carrier mobility, and trap density were reported in our previous
publication.17

Scheme 1a displays
perovskite PDs with an inverted device structure, where the PEO-doped
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)
layer is used as the hole extraction layer (HEL),20 and a 4-lithium styrenesulfonic acid/styrene copolymer
(LiSPS) ionomer layer serves as the interfacial layer,21 where PEO is poly(ethylene oxide). Scheme 1b presents the molecular
structures of PEDOT:PSS, PEO, LiSPS, and PC61BM, where
PC61BM is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester. The PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS layer was selected as the HEL since
it possesses a dramatically enhanced electrical conductivity, which
would facilitate the hole extraction, transport, and collection from
the perovskite photoactive layer to the ITO anode, where ITO is indium
tin oxide.20 The LiSPS is selected as an
interfacial layer because it can fill in the pinholes of the solution-processed
perovskite thin film and benefit the electron collection.21 Thus, high photocurrent and low dark current
are anticipated from perovskite PDs. Scheme 1c displays the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy
levels of CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+, LiSPS, and PC61BM and the work function
of ITO, PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS, and aluminum (Al) electrodes. The deep
work-function PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS layer can facilitate separated holes
to be efficiently collected by the ITO anode. The high LUMO energy
level and the deep HOMO energy level of the LiSPS thin layer could
prevent the back transfer of electrons to the perovskite and hole
injection from the cathode, resulting in suppressed interfacial charge
carrier recombination and leakage current, consequently improved photocurrent
and reduced dark current.21

Figure 1a presents
the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite PDs fabricated by either
the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film
or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, measured
in dark and under monochromatic light at a wavelength of 500 nm with
a light intensity of 0.28 mW cm–2 at room temperature.
The dark current density (Jd) observed
from perovskite PDs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film is 4.4 × 10–8 mA cm–2 at a bias of −1.5 V, which is nearly two orders
of magnitude smaller than that (2.7 × 10–6 mA
cm–2) by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. Moreover, the photocurrent density/dark
current density (Jph/Jd) ratios versus the applied voltages for perovskite PDs
fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film
are over two orders of magnitude higher than those of perovskite PDs
fabricated by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film at the same reverse bias, as shown in Figure 1b, indicating that perovskite
PDs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film
possess high sensitivity.

Figure 1 (a) J–V characteristics
of the perovskite photodetectors fabricated by either the pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, measured both in dark
and under monochromatic light at a wavelength of 500 nm with a light
intensity of 0.28 mW cm–2 at room temperature; (b) Jon/Joff ratio versus
biases of the perovskite photodetectors fabricated by either pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film.

In PDs, the saturated dark current density, J0, determining the detectivity of PDs,22 is directly related to the band-to-band thermal emission and charge
carrier recombination in semiconductors.23,24 The J0 can be extracted from the equation
of J = J0[exp (q(V – JRs)/nkbT) – 1]
– Jph (where J is the total current density, V is the applied
voltage, q is the elementary electron charge, RS is the series resistance, n is the idea factor, kb is the Boltzmann
constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Jph is the photocurrent.).23,24 The  versus the (Jph + J)−1 is shown in Figure 2a. Thus, Rs values
for perovskite PDs fabricated by either the pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film are 0.90 and 0.20 Ohm cm2,
respectively. Smaller RS indicates that
perovskite PDs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5
mol %) thin film possess high Jph. Figure 2b presents the ln(Jph + J) versus the (V – RsJ) and the linear fittings, which are based on the J–V characteristics of perovskite PDs. Thus, J0 values are estimated to be 1.02 × 10–11 mA cm–2 for perovskite PDs fabricated
by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film and 4.01
× 10–10 mA cm–2 for perovskite
PDs fabricated by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. Both J0 values are
lower than that from the copper indium gallium selenide PDs (6 ×
10–7 mA cm–2),23 which indicates that perovskite PDs possess high sensitivity.22

Figure 2 (a) Plot of  versus (Jph + J)−1 and linear fitting of
the perovskite photodetectors by either pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %)
thin film and (b) plot of ln(Jph + J) versus (V – RsT) and the linear fitting.

At a reverse bias of −100 mV and under monochromatic
illumination
at a wavelength (λ) of 500 nm with a light intensity of 0.28
mW cm–2, Jph values
of perovskite PDs fabricated by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film are 3.0 × 10–4 and
8.7 × 10–4 A cm–2, respectively.
Thus, for perovskite PDs fabricated by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, R (responsibility)
values, which  (where Llight is the incident light intensity), are
1.1 and 3.1 A W–1, respectively. The projected detectivities
(D*),
described by ,22 are estimated
to be 2.2 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W–1 for perovskite PDs fabricated by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and 5.2 × 1014 cm
Hz1/2 W–1 for perovskite PDs fabricated
by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film. Noted
that projected detectivity, D*, is estimated solely
based on measured dark current density rather than measured noise
current density. The real detectivity of perovskite PDs is probably
lower than D* due to the omission of thermal noise
and 1/f noise, where f is the frequency.25,26 However, the estimated detectivity is acceptable since the noise
current is typically frequency-independent and is in the same magnitude
of shot noise (from dark current) for PDs with a “vertical”
photodiode device structure.27−29

Based on measured external
quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown
in Figure 3a and D* at 500 nm, R and D* over the spectral response region are derived. Figure 3b presents R and D* over the spectral region ranging from 350
to 800 nm. The perovskite PDs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film possess D* over
1014 cm Hz1/2 W–1 at room
temperature, which is over 20 times higher than those by the pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. Moreover, as
indicated in Table 1, the perovskite PDs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film is one of the highest detectivities reported
for perovskite PDs.11−15,26,28,30−33 Moreover, this value is about
two orders of magnitude higher than that of silicon-based PDs in the
spectral response from 350 to 700 nm also. Such high detectivity and
responsibility at room temperature are synergistically originated
from high Jph and extremely low Jd.22

A linear
dynamic range (LDR) or the photosensitivity linearity
(typically quoted in dB), one typical figure of merit that used to
evaluate PD device performance, is also investigated. The LDR can
be estimated according to the equation of LDR = 20 log (Jph*/Jd) (where the Jph* is the photocurrent
measured at a light intensity of 1 mW cm–2).22,23Figure 4a displays
the Jph versus the light intensities for
perovskite PDs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5
mol %) thin film. At room temperature, the LDR is over 100 dB, which
is higher than that (47 dB) of perovskite PDs by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.15 This large LDR is comparable to that of Si-based PDs (120
dB, at 77 K) and is significantly higher than that (66 dB, at 4.2
K) of InGaAs-based PDs.34

CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin film and (b) transient
photocurrent of the perovskite photodetectors measured with an optical
chopper (frequency: 2 kHz) controlled 532 nm laser pulse.

The temporal response time of perovskite PDs, an important
parameter
reflecting PD performance, is also characterized. The response time
of PDs is strongly related to the charge transport and collection.
Rise and fall times are defined as the time to increase from 10 to
90% of the peak photocurrent and decrease from 90 to 10% of the peak
photocurrent, respectively. As shown in Figure 4b, perovskite PDs fabricated by the pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film show values
of 32.8 and 28.4 μs for rise and fall times, respectively, whereas
the fast rise time of 19.6 μs and fall time 12.8 μs are
observed from perovskite PDs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+(x = 0.5 mol %). The faster response time of perovskite PDs fabricated
by CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+(x = 0.5 mol %) is attributed to the suppressed
defects and enhanced charge carrier mobilities of the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+(x = 0.5 mol %) thin film.

Conclusions
In
summary, novel hybrid perovskite materials, where Pb2+ cations
were partially substituted by heterovalent neodymium cations
(Nd3+), were utilized for solution-processed perovskite
photodetectors (PDs). Operated at room temperature, an ultrahigh detectivity
over 1014 cm Hz1/2 W–1 in
a spectral region from 350 to 800 nm with a linear dynamic range over
100 dB was observed from perovskite PDs by the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+(x = 0.5 mol %) thin film. Such boosted device performance
is resulted from superior film morphological and optoelectronic properties
in the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+(x = 0.5 mol %) thin film, which
brings enhanced photocurrent but reduced dark current. These findings
open a new window for tuning the electronic properties of hybrid perovskite
materials via heterovalent substitution for boosting device performance
of perovskite PDs.

Experimental Section
Materials
Nd2O3 (99.5%) was purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios
PH1000) was purchased from Heraeus Precious Metals North America.
PEO (with a molecular weight (Mw) of 500
g mol–1) was purchased from Scientific Polymer Inc.
PC61BM (99.5%) was purchased from Solenne BV. Lead iodide
(PbI2, 99.999%, beads), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.5%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), and
anhydrous toluene (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals
were used as received without further purification. Methylammonium
iodide (CH3NH3I) and LiSPS were synthesized
in our labortary.18,19 NdCl3 precursor solution
was prepared by adding Nd2O3 into HCl (37% w)
with an accurate stoichiometric ratio and then accompany with the
addition of DMF solvent. The Nd-doped PbI2 precursor solution
was prepared by mixing NdCl3 precursor solution with 0.87
M PbI2 in DMF with the fixing molar ratio of Nd to Pb equal
to 0.5%.

Thin Film Preparation
Either the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin films were prepared via a two-step method: First,
the lead precursors (pristine PbI2 in DMF and Nd-doped
PbI2 in DMF) and the substrates were preheated at 70 °C
for 5 min; different lead precursors were spin-coated on the top of
substrates, followed with thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 min
and then cooling down to room temperature. Second, CH3NH3I solution (0.25 M in ethanol) was then casted on the top
of lead precursor layers. Afterward, above layers were thermally annealed
at 108 °C for 2 h for converting either PbI2 or Nd-doped
PbI2 with CH3NH3I into the pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ (x = 0.5 mol %) thin films.

Fabrication and Characterization
of Photodetectors
The ITO-coated glasses were precleaned
by detergent, deionized water,
acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. After oven drying, the ITO-coated
glasses were treated with UV–ozone for 40 min under an ambient
atmosphere. Then, a ∼40 nm PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated
on the top of the ITO surface from PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS solution, followed
with thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in an ambient atmosphere.
Afterward, the PEO-doped PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were immediately
transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox and ready for deposition
of either the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 or the CH3NH3PbI3:xNd3+ layers via a two-step method. After the predevices
were cooled down to room temperature, a ∼15 nm LiSPS layer
was spin-coated from toluene solution on the top of the perovskite
active layer. A ∼50 nm PC61BM layer was then coated
on the top of the LiSPS layer from chlorobenzene solution. Last, a
∼100 nm-thick Al was thermally deposited through a shadow mask
under a pressure of 6 × 10–6 mbar in a vacuum
chamber on the top of the PC61BM layer. The device area
was measured to be 0.16 cm2. The J–V characteristics were measured by using a Keithley 2400
source-power unit. A Newport Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) full-spectrum
solar simulator was applied as the light source, calibrated by a monosilicon
detector from NREL. A specific wavelength was obtained by a spectrum
filter for giving a monochromic light at 500 nm with a light intensity
of 0.28 mW cm–2. The transient photocurrent measurements
were performed by using an optical chopper controlled at λ =
532 nm laser pulse at a frequency of 2 kHz.
