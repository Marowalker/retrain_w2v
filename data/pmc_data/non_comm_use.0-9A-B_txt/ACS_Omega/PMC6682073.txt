Effects
of hardness and the pH value of water in a water pool on
PEG-based nonionic surfactant dyeing of cotton fiber with reactive
dyes in a heptane reverse micelle system were investigated in terms
of the color yield, reflectance, CIE L*a*b* value, and unlevelness. Results reveal that
the effect of the water-pool pH value on the color yield and reflectance
are more significant than the effect of hardness in the water pool.
The dyed fabrics under an alkaline water-pool condition obtain a lower
color yield and higher reflectance percentage than those under acidic
and nearly neutral conditions. The increase of hardness in a water
pool has higher influence on unlevelness of dyed samples than the
increase or decrease of the pH value in a water pool. The changes
in hardness and the pH value in a water pool did not result in a significant
change in CIE L*a*b* values of dyed specimens, and no chromatic change was found in
dyed fabrics. Excellent washing fastness results of the dyed fabrics,
guaranteeing adequate removal of unfixed dyes, assure accuracy of
the results in a spectrophotometric measurement.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In a conventional aqueous
textile dyeing process, water plays the
most essential role as the medium for dyeing of natural and synthetic
textile fibers. The dyeing quality and final shade of textile products
are highly influenced by the quality of water used throughout the
dyeing process. However, water supplied from nearly all sources contains
impurities to some extent. The most common impurities are hardness,
heavy metals, alkalinity, etc.1,2

Water hardness
can be regarded as the amount of calcium and magnesium
salts presented in water, and it is expressed as of the calcium carbonate
(CaCO3) equivalent.3 The unit
of measurement is parts per million (ppm). If the amount of hardness
in water is less than 60 ppm, it is regarded as soft water. If the
amount of hardness is more than 180 ppm, it is termed as hard water.4 Hard water is generally undesirable in the dyeing
process since it may cause dye precipitation, promoting dye aggregation,
which results in certain dyeing defects such as uneven dyeing,5 color specks, and loss of depth.2,3,6,7 In
addition, hard water may interfere with solubility of the dye,8 alter the color of the dye, and adversely affect
color appearance of textile products.9

Alkalinity is also one of the influential factors for conventional
reactive dyeing of cotton fabrics. Reactive dyes are different from
other dye classes. They rely on elevated pH (alkaline condition) to
have a reaction with the hydroxyl group of cellulose, mostly by nucleophilic
substitution or addition, to form covalent bonds. However, the competing
reaction of the dye with hydroxide ions in the dye bath is prominent,
which may produce a hydrolyzed, nonreactive form of the dye, leading
to serious environmental problems due to the production of colored
effluent discharge after soaping and washing-off processes.10 To eliminate the environmental impact, works
have been done on dyeing cotton at a neutral pH condition11−13 or by low add-on technology controlling the wet-pick up.14 Novel methods, such as chemical grafting of
the disperse dye onto polyacrylonitrile,15 dyeing of nylon 6 with extracted natural dyes from waste leaves,16 computational and experimental assessment on
corona discharge surface ionization of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET),17 and dyeing of PET with various
nanosilica particles,18 have also been
investigated.

In our previous
papers, we have studied feasibility of applying
computerized color matching (CCM) on reverse micellar dyed cotton19 and analyzing the influence of the hydrophilic–lipophilic
balance value and dye agglomeration on a reverse micellar dyeing system.20,21 However, influences of hardness and the pH value in water for forming
a water pool in the reverse micellar nonaqueous reactive dyeing of
cotton are still unknown and have not yet been reported in the literature.
Therefore, this study focuses on examining the influences of water
hardness and the pH value on reverse micellar dyeing of cotton for
the following purposes: (i) to dye cotton fabrics with the use of
reactive dyes in a reverse micellar heptane-assisted dyeing system
under different water hardness and pH (acidity and alkalinity) in
a water pool, (ii) to assess the color strength and unlevelness of
the fabrics colored with a water pool containing deionized water and
the fabric dyed with a water pool comprising different water hardness
and pH values, (iii) to compare and assess the difference between
fabrics dyed with a water pool containing deionized water and the
fabric dyed with a water pool comprising different water hardness
and pH values based on reflectance (R, %), color
strength (K/Ssum value),
and unlevelness (relative unlevelness index), and (iv) to evaluate
the washing fastness property of dyed fabrics.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Reflectance
2.1.1 Reflectance at Different pH Values
Figure 1 illustrates
reflectance curves of red, blue, and yellow dyed fabrics: series 1
(pH 6 of deionized water without any pH manipulation), series 2 (pH
4, which is in an acidic condition), and series 3 (pH 10, which is
in an alkaline condition). Reflectance curves of series 1 and 2 in
each color were found to exhibit nearly the same reflectance percentage
without noticeable differences, leading to similar final shades of
the fabrics as when dyed in a PEG-based nonionic reverse micelle system.
However, when the fabrics were dyed in an alkaline condition (series
3 in pH 10), the reflectance percentages of red, blue, and yellow
colors are slightly higher than fabrics dyed in nearly neutral and
acidic conditions (series 1 and 2). As a higher reflectance percentage
means lower dye absorption, this indicates that the dyeing in alkaline
conditions results in a lighter shade when compared with that in nearly
neutral and acidic conditions. The possible reason is alkaline hydrolysis
of the dye in the core of the reverse micelle (water pool). Although
the volume of the water pool is small in the core of the reverse micelle
that can largely minimize the impact of dye hydrolysis, a certain
degree of dye hydrolysis is inevitable when under an alkaline condition.24 In addition, reflectance curves (Figure 1) are identical in shape and
have their own pattern corresponding to the color. No shifting of
the peak along the range of 400 to 700 nm was observed, indicating
there is no chromatic change under different pH conditions.

the reflectance of colored cotton substrates under
different pH conditions: (a) red, (b) blue, and (c) yellow colors
(0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 represent 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.5%, 2.5%, and
3.5% o.w.f., respectively).

2.1.2 Reflectance at Different Water Hardness
Figure 2 presents
reflectance curves of fabrics dyed with different water hardness (ppm):
series 1 (deionized water), series 4 (50 ppm), series 5 (100 ppm),
series 6 (300 ppm), and series 7 (500 ppm). The results reveal that
the fabric samples dyed with or without hardness in a PEG-based nonionic
reverse micelle system exhibit similar reflectance curves, without
noticeable variation in the reflectance percentage within 400 to 700
nm. This indicates that hardness, caused by the presence of calcium
ions in the water pool, has minimal impact on the dye molecules since
the volume of the water pool in the reverse micellar core is very
little (0.5 mL). In addition, it was also found that the increase
of hardness does not have a catastrophic effect on peak shifting of
the curves and the chromatic change in the dyed fabric samples.

the reflectance of colored cotton substrates under
different hardness conditions: (a) red, (b) blue, and (c) yellow colors
(0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 represent 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5%
o.w.f., respectively).

2.2 Color Yield
The color yield, based
on K/Ssum values, of
the colored cotton substrates is shown in Table 1. Regarding the influence of water-pool pH
values (series 1 to 3) on a PEG-based reverse micellar dyeing system,
the experiment results reveal that fabrics dyed under an alkaline
condition (series 3) obtain a significantly lower color yield than
fabrics dyed in deionized water without a pH adjustment (series 1),
while fabrics dyed under an acidic condition (series 2) achieve a
color yield comparable to series 1, except that the high concentration
(3.5%) of red and blue reactive dyes is used. This indicates that
the use of an alkaline water pool is unfavorable to a nonionic reverse
micellar system since alkaline hydrolysis of the dye may cause lower
dye reactivity, resulting in the lower dye uptake, lower color yield,
and lighter shade of the fabrics. Concerning the influence of hardness
in a water pool, the color yield of the dyed fabrics increases or
decreases only slightly when the hardness in the water pool increases
from 50 to 500 ppm (series 4 to 7). The effect of hardness on the
water pool is not significant since only a small volume of the water
pool is required for reverse micellar coloration of cotton so that
the impact of hardness can be greatly minimized.

2.3 CIE L*a*b* Values
L* values in the CIE
system are defined as lightness.21 In a
two-dimensional chart, the value of a*b* can be used to locate the color of the dyed substrates into one
of the four regions: (a) red-yellow region, (b) yellow-green region,
(c) green-blue region, and (d) blue-red region. Table 2 illustrates L*a*b* values in the CIE system of the colored substrates
in the PEG-based reverse micellar dyeing system under different pH
and hardness conditions. Generally speaking, L*a*b* values in the CIE system of the reverse
micellar colored substrates under different pH and hardness conditions
are nearly the same. This indicates that the changes of water hardness
and the pH value in the reverse micellar system for dyeing of cotton
fiber are not significant and influential since only a small volume
of the water pool is used in the system.

2.4 Relative Unlevelness Indices (RUI)
The relative unlevelness indices of the dyed fabrics are listed in Table 3. Fabrics dyed in
different pH (series 1 to 3) values and different water hardness (series
4 to 7) achieved good (unlevelness under close examination) to excellent
levelness (undetectable unlevelness) with RUI values below 0.50 except
three samples (series 4 red 3.5 and series 6 red 1.5 and 3.5) in which
poor levelness ranged from 0.51 to 0.63. This indicates that the influence
of hardness on levelness of the samples is higher than the influence
of the pH value to a certain extent.

a Suggested interpretation of the

2.5 Color Fastness to Laundering
Table 4 shows the results
of the color change of the colored fabric series and color staining
of the multifiber fabrics under the AATCC standard laundering fastness
test. Nearly all samples have an excellent color change and staining
rating of 5 against accelerated laundering except the high concentration
of red and blue colors (3.5%), which have scored ratings of 4–5
with a very small and nearly unnoticeable change of color and staining.
This result indicates that after thorough rinsing following the dyeing
process, unfixed and hydrolyzed dyes were sufficiently removed from
the colored fabric samples.

3 Conclusions
The effects of water hardness and the pH value on PEG-based nonionic
surfactant dyeing of cotton fiber with reactive dyes in a heptane
reverse micelle system were investigated in terms of the color yield,
reflectance, CIE L*a*b* value, and unlevelness. Results reveal that the effect of water-pool
pH on the color yield and reflectance is more significant than that
of water-pool hardness. Generally speaking, water hardness did not
have a significant effect in the reverse micellar dyeing system. The
dyed fabrics under an alkaline water-pool condition (pH 10) obtained
a lower color yield and higher reflectance than those under acidic
(pH 4) and nearly neutral (pH 6) conditions due to alkaline hydrolysis
of dyes. The increase of hardness in the water pool has higher influence
on unlevelness of the dyed samples than the increase or decrease of
the pH value in the water pool. The changes of water-pool hardness
and the pH value do not cause a tremendous change on CIE L*a*b* values of dyed fabrics due
to a small volume of the water pool required for nonionic reverse
micellar dyeing of cotton. Excellent washing fastness results of the
dyed fabrics, guaranteeing adequate removal of unfixed dyes, are obtained,
which assure accuracy of the results in a spectrophotometric measurement.

nonionic poly(ethylene glycol) (12) tridecyl ether (PEG-12), 1-octanol,
and n-heptane were used as surfactant, cosurfactant,
and solvent, respectively. These were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and Acros Organics. Sodium carbonate (NaCO3) was used for
fixation in reactive dyeing. Reactive dyes were supplied by Dystar
from Shanghai and were directly used without further purification
(Levafix CA Red, Levafix CA Blue, and Levafix CA Yellow). Two grams
of pure cotton interlock bleached fabric was used for dyeing. The
fabric count was 40 × 40 and expressed as wales and courses per
inch, respectively. It was first cleaned with detergent (2 g/L) at
49 °C for 45 min, tumble-dried, and conditioned at 65 ±
2% RH and 20 ± 2 °C for 24 h.

4.2 Preparation
of Water with Different Degrees
of Hardness and pH Values
Hard water was prepared by adding
calcium chloride (CaCl2) to deionized water and titrated
with EDTA solution (0.01 M). Total water hardness is expressed as
parts per million (ppm).22 Water with a
pH value of 4 was prepared by adding sodium acetate (NaAc) and acetic
acid (HAc) (reagent grade) to deionized water to lower the pH value,
whereas water with a pH value of 10 was prepared by adding ammonium
chloride (NH4Cl) and ammonia solution (NH3·H2O) (reagent grade) to deionized water to increase the pH value.
The pH values of the liquors were monitored and measured by a portable
pH meter (Thermo Scientific, Singapore).

4.3 Dye-Encapsulated
Heptane Reverse Micellar
Solution
A PEG-12 surfactant (nonionic in nature) was initially
mixed with a cosurfactant (1-Octanol) to form a surfactant/cosurfactant
mixture. Heptane (min 99% pure) was then added into the mixture, forming
a reverse micelle solution. Aqueous dye solutions were added to the
reverse micelle solution dropwise. The dye/reverse micelle solution
mixture was then stirred until it was well dispersed with the dye
encapsulated in the reverse micelle without phase separation. The
ratio and volume required for the formation of the dye-encapsulated
reverse micelle solution are listed in Table 5.

4.4 Heptane-Based Nonaqueous Coloration of Cotton
Five
dye concentrations (%), which were 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and
3.5, were used for coloration of cotton, and they are expressed in
on weight-of-fiber (o.w.f.). Cotton fabrics were first immersed in
a series of dye-encapsulated reverse micelle solutions. Series 1,
used as the control, was dyed with the water pool made of deionized
water without a pH adjustment and hardness manipulation. Other series
were prepared with different water-pool hardness and pH values according
to Table 6. The workflow
of heptane-assisted dyeing of cotton fabrics (without salt) is shown
in Figure 3. The dye
liquors were put into a water bath and agitated for 10 min at 30 °C.
The dyeing temperature was increased to 70 °C under control (2
°C/min.). Dyeing of cotton was conducted at 70 °C for 40
min, followed by the addition of 0.3 mL of soda ash of different concentrations
(Table 7) to allow
fixation of the dye on cotton for 60 min. The dyed fabrics were then
soaped twice (2 g/L soap) at 50 °C for 20 min, water rinsed,
air-dried, and conditioned for 24 h before the subsequent experiment.

4.5 Color Property Measurement
Color
strength of colored substrates was measured by an SF650 spectrophotometer
manufactured by DataColor International in U.S. under the illuminant
D65 and 10° standard observer with a large aperture
(30 mm). K/S values in the range
of 400–700 nm were measured based on eq 1.3 A higher K/S value represents better color strength
of the dyed substrates. K/Ssum values were obtained by the sum of K/S values obtained over a wavelength of 400–700 nm.
The average K/Ssum value
of four measurements was taken for each sample 1  where K is
the absorption coefficient, based on the colorant concentration, S is the coefficient of scattering of the colored specimen,
and R is the reflectance of the colored substrate.

The CIE L*a*b* values of the colored cotton substrates were obtained by using
similar apparatus and conditions as stated for the color strength
measurement. Four repeated measurements were conducted. The averages
of CIE L* values, a* values, and b* values of the four measurements for each dyed substrate
were taken.

4.6 Unlevelness Evaluation
The unlevelness
of the dyed cotton fabrics was measured by relative unlevelness indices
(RUI).23 Reflectance (R, %) at four random spots of the colored substrates was measured
with the use of similar apparatus and conditions as stated in Section 4.5. Four repeated
measurements were conducted, and RUI values were calculated according
to eq 2 2  

where Sλ is the standard deviation of reflectance at a
specified wavelength, R ®is the reflectance
at a specific wavelength, and Vλ is the photopic relative luminous efficiency function.

4.7 Laundering Colorfastness Testing
The color fastness
to accelerated laundering of colored cotton substrates
was tested by the Test Method 61, No. 2A (2013) from AATCC. The ratings
of the change in color of colored cotton substrates and their staining
ratings on multifiber fabrics were reported.
