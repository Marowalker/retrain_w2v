A simple
and efficient synthetic method for preparing high-surface-area perovskites
was investigated by focusing on the importance of the formation of
an amorphous precursor. Hexagonal SrMnO3 with high surface
area was successfully synthesized by simple calcination of the amorphous
precursor prepared using aspartic acid and metal acetates instead of metal nitrates, without
pH adjustment. The specific surface area reached up to ca. 50 m2 g–1, which is much larger than that for
SrMnO3 synthesized by previously reported methods. The
catalytic activity for heterogeneous liquid-phase aerobic oxidation
was significantly improved in comparison with the polymerized complex
method, and the present catalytic system was applicable to the oxidation
of various substrates.

Introduction
Perovskite-type oxides
with the general formula ABO3 are a class of mixed oxides
that exhibit compositional and structural
varieties. The versatility and accessibility of perovskite-type oxides
have attracted significant interest in broad fields of piezoelectric,
ferroelectric, (anti)ferromagnetic, catalytic, and semiconducting
materials.1 A number of methods for the
synthesis of perovskites, such as solid-state, coprecipitation, sol–gel,
hydrothermal, freeze/spray drying, and microwave methods, have been
developed.2 In particular, an increase
of surface area is important for catalytic applications, and many
efforts have been made to synthesize nanoperovskites with high surface
areas. The sol–gel methods represented by the Pechini method
and polymerized complex (PC) method are among the most studied and
frequently used techniques for the preparation of nanoperovskites
because these methods can accurately control the final composition
and yield pure and homogeneous perovskites.3 However, these methods have some disadvantages in that they are
(i) complicated procedures that include complex and polymer gel formation,
pyrolysis to an amorphous precursor, and calcination and they require
(ii) the use of toxic ethylene glycol and significant amounts of organic
reagents and (iii) high-temperature calcination to remove carbonates
formed from the carbonaceous precursors, which results in low specific
surface area. In addition, the combustion of carbon species elevates
the temperature of the material itself and further sinters the material,
which decreases the surface area. Therefore, the development of simple
and efficient synthesis methods to obtain highly homogeneous and dispersed
perovskite nanomaterials with high surface area is still strongly
required and a challenging research subject.

We have recently
reported that hexagonal SrMnO3 (SMO-PC)
synthesized by the PC method with a surface area of 25 m2 g–1 can act as an efficient reusable heterogeneous
catalyst for the selective liquid-phase oxidation of various organic
substrates with O2.4 The synthesis
of high-surface-area SMO can improve its catalytic activity. Teraoka
and co-workers reported La0.8Sr0.2MO3 (M = Mn and Co) with high surface area (37 and 20 m2 g–1, respectively) synthesized by a hydroxyl acid-aided
method combined with pH adjustment of the starting solution using nitrate salts that are commonly used as metal sources in
sol–gel synthesis.5 However, this
method could not be applied to the synthesis of high-surface-area
SMO because the precursor from the metal nitrates contained only crystalline Sr(NO3)2 and pure
SMO was not formed by calcinations, even at 1223 K (details discussed
later). In this study, we focus on the importance of the formation
of an amorphous precursor during nanoperovskite synthesis and investigate
an alternative, simple, and efficient synthetic route to prepare high-surface-area
SMO by simple calcination of the amorphous precursor using amino acid
(aspartic acid (AA)) and metal acetates instead of
metal nitrates without pH adjustment. The structures
of the amorphous precursor and nanoperovskite and the catalytic activity
for liquid-phase aerobic oxidation are investigated. This study provides
the first example of amino acid-aided synthesis of a perovskite nanocatalyst
for liquid-phase aerobic oxidation.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis of SMO with high surface area was attempted according
to the hydroxy acid-aided method; however, this was unsuccessful (Figure 1).5 The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for the precursor
synthesized with metal nitrates and malic acid (HA
precursor) exhibited only peaks assignable to Sr(NO3)2 (Figure 2a).
Complex mixtures, including SMO, Sr7Mn4O15, and unidentified phases, were formed by the calcination
of HA precursor at 823–1223 K (Figure S1). The pH adjustment during precursor preparation has been reported
to play an important role in the synthesis of pure La0.8Sr0.2MO3 (M = Mn and Co);5a therefore, HA precursors were also synthesized by adjustment
of the starting solution pH in the range of 3.0–9.0 with aqueous
NH3. However, pH adjustment was not effective for reducing
the formation of Sr(NO3)2 in precursors and
did not improve the purity of SMO (Figure 3). These results indicate that the presence
of NO3– in the starting materials likely
prevents (i) the formation of the amorphous precursor on the basis
of metal malate species, which would be required to obtain single
SMO nanomaterials and (ii) fast ligand exchange reaction between the
metal nitrates and malic acid. Therefore, the metal sources were changed
from nitrates to acetates due to
the weaker acidity of acetic acid (pKa = 4.76) than that of malic acid (pKa1 = 3.4), which is expected to accelerate the ligand exchange reactions.
The aqueous solution containing acetates (Sr(OAc)2·0.5H2O and Mn(OAc)2·4H2O) and malic acid (1.5 equiv with respect to the total metal
amount) was evaporated to dryness, and the resultant pale pink powder
was dried at 463 K for 1 h to give the MA precursor. The precursor
is completely amorphous, as confirmed by the lack of XRD peaks that
would suggest a crystalline material (Figure 2b). The IR absorption spectrum of the MA
precursor is shown in Figure 4c. Although the spectrum of precursor MA has carboxylate bands
similar to that of the acetate starting materials (Sr(OAc)2 and Mn(OAc)2) (Figure S2),
the observed bands are assignable to metal carboxylate salts because
of the following results: (i) The carboxylate stretching band positions
in the IR spectra of precursor MA (1401/1578 cm–1) were different from those (1429/1563 and 1415/1560 cm–1 for Sr(OAc)2 and Mn(OAc)2, respectively) of
the starting materials. (ii) Other IR bands of MA were hardly observed
in the IR spectra of precursor MA. (iii) The XRD patterns of the precursors
did not show the peaks of the acetate starting materials. (iv) The
electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (ESI-TOF-MS)
spectrum of precursor MA in MeOH/H2O (1/1, v/v) showed
several peaks assignable to strontium and/or manganese malate salts
(e.g., m/z = 489, 522, and 555 assignable
to [Mn2(C4H4O5)2(C4H3O4)]−, [SrMn(C4H4O5)2(C4H3O4)]−, and [Sr2(C4H4O5)2(C4H3O4)]−, respectively) without
the observation of the peaks of the acetate starting materials (Figures 4d and S3). These results suggest that the anion exchange
reaction between acetate salts and carboxylic acid likely proceed.
The bands at 1401 and 1578 cm–1 are assignable to
the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate
groups, respectively, and the Δ (νasym(COO–) – νsym(COO–)) value was 177 cm–1, which suggests bridging
bidentate bonding.6 These results suggest
that precursor MA is an amorphous malate salt with the metal cations
linked by malate anions, as shown in Figure 1.

Next, the effect of various carboxylic acid additives (MA,
AA,
tartaric acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, alanine, and glutamic acid
(Figure 5)) on the
precursor formation was investigated (3 equiv of total carboxylic
group with respect to the total metal amount). XRD measurements indicated
that only the AA, MA, and glutamic acid precursors are completely
amorphous (Figure 6). Although small XRD peaks were observed for the precursors from
citric acid, which is the most frequently used hydroxyl acid additive,
the precursors prepared with tartaric, oxalic acids, and alanine or
without carboxylic acids were not amorphous (Figure 6). Thermogravimetry-differential thermal
analysis (TG-DTA) curves of the AA and MA precursors had exothermic
peaks with weight loss at around 573–823 K, which suggests
that both precursors decompose below 823 K (Figure 7). Therefore, the formation of single-phase
SMO was confirmed by calcination of these precursors at 823 K for
5 h. Among the precursors tested, only AA and MA gave single-phase
SMO (SMO-AA and SMO-MA, respectively) without the formation of SrCO3 and manganese oxides (Figures 2 and 6). Although the precursor
prepared from glutamic acid was amorphous, the XRD measurement revealed
the formation of a mixture of SrMnO3 and SrCO3 after the calcination likely due to the higher carbon content in
glutamic acid than AA. The calcination temperature of precursors AA
and MA to obtain pure SMO was 823 K and lower than that (923 K) of
precursor PC. The measurements of TG-DTA for the decomposition of
amorphous precursors AA, MA, and PC revealed that a significant weight
loss of each precursor was observed at 473–873 K (Figures 7 and S5). However, the percent weight losses of precursors
AA and MA in the temperature range of 300–1073 K (70 and 66%,
respectively) were smaller than that (75%) of precursor PC. The difference
is likely due to the lower carbon contents of precursors AA and MA
(28.36 and 28.00 wt %, respectively) than that of precursor PC (37.76
wt %). In separate experiments, it was confirmed by IR spectroscopy
that SMO-AA and SMO-MA showed lower band intensities of surface carbonates
than that of SMO-PC (Figure S6). All of
these results suggest that the formation of an amorphous precursor
by using dicarboxylic acid with a lower carbon content would be important
to obtain pure SMO at a low calcination temperature. The specific
surface areas of SMO-AA and SMO-MA calculated from a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) plot of the N2 adsorption isotherm (77 K) were up
to 47 and 42 m2 g–1, respectively. It
should be noted that these specific surface areas for SMO-AA and SMO-MA
are much larger than those (2–25 m2 g–1) for SMOs synthesized by conventional methods such as the PC, acetate,
sol–gel combustion, cellulose templating, and citrate methods
(Table S1).4,7 In addition,
synthesis using the AA and MA precursors yield pure SMO at lower calcination
temperatures (by 100–400 K), possibly because the amorphous
precursors with relatively low carbon contents are readily decomposed.
The pH of the starting solution for the AA precursor (pH 4.23) was
higher than those for the HA and MA precursors (pHs 1.64 and 3.70,
respectively), which indicates that the use of metal acetates and
AA containing NH2 amino groups significantly accelerates
the ligand exchange reaction without pH adjustment. Such a difference
of the precursor formation processes is considered to influence the
purity of SMO and the resultant surface areas. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of SMO-AA and SMO-MA obtained at 823 K and SMO-PC obtained
at 923 K are shown in Figure 8. The nanoparticles have spherical-like morphology and are
estimated to be 10–40 nm. On the other hand, a sintering of
SMO nanoparticles was observed in the case of SMO-PC. In addition,
the size and morphology of SMO-AA and SMO-MA were quite different
from those of the amorphous AA and MA precursors (Figure 8). Therefore, these nanostructures
are constructed during low-temperature decomposition of the amorphous
precursors with micrometer-order plate-like morphologies. The Raman
spectra of SMO-AA and SMO-MA showed bands at 635/434 and 635/434 cm–1, respectively (Figure S7). The band positions are similar to those for the previously reported
SMO.4,8 These bands are assignable to the A1g and E1g modes, respectively, which are characteristic
of the Mn2O9 moiety. The transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of SMO-AA is shown in Figure 9. A particle size distribution of ca. 10–40
nm was observed, in reasonable agreement with that observed for the
SEM measurement, that calculated from the (110) diffraction lines
using Scherrer’s equation (d = 27 nm), and
that calculated from the BET surface area and density, assuming the
particles are spherical (d = 24 nm). The clear lattice
fringes throughout the particles indicate crystallinity of the SMO
particles. The distance between two fringes is ca. 0.28 nm, which
is close to the d-spacing of (110) the plane of hexagonal
SMO. These Raman and TEM results also support the formation of SMO-AA
and SMO-MA nanoperovskites. The surface Mn valent state was investigated
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). There was no significant
difference in the relative intensities of the Mn(III) and Mn(IV) species
between SMO-AA (55/45) and SMO-MA (52/48) (Figure S8a). XPS spectra of O1s for SMO-AA and SMO-MA were also measured
(Figure S8b). The broad peaks can be deconvoluted
into four components (lattice oxygen, surface OH group, defective
oxygen, and adsorbed H2O).9 Quantitative
analysis showed that the amount of defective oxygen, which is possibly
related to the site for O2 activation, in SMO-AA (18%)
was larger than that in SMO-MA (13%). H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR) and TG-DTA analyses were carried out
to examine the reducibilities of SMO-AA and SMO-MA (Figures S9 and S10). The H2-TPR profile of SMO-AA
and SMO-MA showed that the catalysts were reduced starting from ca.
423 K and two broad peaks at 683/719 and 686/716 K were observed,
respectively. These peaks are likely ascribed to the reduction of
SrMnO3 to SrMnO2.5. Figure S10 shows the TG-DTA curves of SMO-AA and SMO-MA under H2/N2 and N2 atmospheres. The significant
weight losses were observed in the temperature range between 473 and
723 K under reductive conditions (H2/N2 = 1/9),
whereas the TG curves under N2 atmosphere remained almost
unchanged. These results support that the reduction of SMO occurs
due to the reaction with H2 and that SMO is more thermally
stable in N2 atmosphere than typical MnO2.10 On the other hand, the reduction peak temperatures
of SMO-PC were 720 and 758 K and higher than those of SMO-AA and SMO-MA.

To investigate the effectiveness of the present synthesis
methods,
the catalytic activities of SMO-AA, SMO-MA, and SMO-PC were compared
for the oxygenation of fluorene (1a) to fluorenone (2a) at 333 K with molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant. The
time course for each catalyst is shown in Figure 10. Oxidation did not proceed at all in the
absence of a catalyst. Catalytic oxidation with SMO proceeded efficiently
without an induction period caused by the formation of other active
species. Among the catalysts tested, SMO-AA had the highest catalytic
activity to afford 2a in 96% yield for 24 h. The reaction
rate decreased in the order of SMO-AA (2.4 mM min–1) > SMO-MA (1.1 mM min–1) > SMO-PC (0.50
mM min–1). There was no significant difference in
the XPS
of Mn 2p, H2-TPR, and TG-DTA results between SMO-AA and
SMO-MA, whereas the surface area and the amount of defective oxygen
in SMO-AA were larger than those in SMO-MA. These results suggest
that the activity differences between SMO-AA and SMO-MA are possibly
due to the surface area and/or the number of active sites. Although
several effective heterogeneous catalyst systems including Mn-based
catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of 1a have been reported,
they typically require high reaction temperatures, high O2 pressures, or additives (radical initiator, strong base, etc.) to
obtain 2a in high yield.11 Thus, the present system catalyzes the oxidation under mild reaction
conditions; the reaction temperature (333 K) was much lower than that
(368–443 K) for previously reported systems at 1 atm of O2 without any additives (Table S2).11g,11h,12 The oxygenation
of 1a was completed within 8 h by increasing the reaction
temperature to 353 K (Figure 10e). To verify whether the observed catalysis is derived from
solid SMO-AA or leached manganese and strontium species, the oxidation
of 1a was performed under the condition described in Figure 10e. The catalyst,
SMO-AA, was removed from the reaction mixture by hot filtration at
approximately 50% conversion of 1a (at t = 30 min), and then the filtrate was heated again at 353 K. In this
case, no further production of 2a was observed, suggesting
that the observed catalysis for the present oxidation is truly heterogeneous
(Figure 11). The used
SMO-AA could be recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration.
The recovered SMO-AA could then be reused without significant loss
of its catalytic activity, that is, >99% yield of 2a with
the fresh catalyst and >99% for the reuse catalyst.

353 K for (e)).

To investigate the reaction mechanism, the oxidation of 1a with activated MnO2 and SMO-AA was carried out
under
Ar atmosphere (Figure 12a). In the case of activated MnO2, the yields of 2a were 64 and 41% for 8 h under O2 and Ar atmospheres,
respectively. These phenomena have been observed for MnO2-catalyzed oxidation with O2 and are explained by oxidation
with oxygen supplied from the solid (Mars-van Krevelen Mechanism).13 On the other hand, the reactivity of SMO-AA
under O2 and Ar atmospheres was significantly different
from that of activated MnO2. The SMO-AA-catalyzed oxidation
of 1a to 2a efficiently proceeded in the
presence of O2, whereas 2a was not obtained
under Ar atmosphere and a small amount of only 9,9′-difluorene
was formed for 27 h. Such a reactivity difference has been reported
for the catalytic oxidation of alcohols with O2 over SMO-PC,
and the reaction mechanism involving O2 activation (e.g.,
the formation of Mn-superoxo species confirmed by IR spectroscopy)
has been proposed.4 Such a species would
also play an important role in the present oxidation. The origin of
the oxygen atoms incorporated in 2a was investigated
with 18O-labeling experiments (Figure 12b). For the MnO2-catalyzed oxidation
of 1a, the 18O content in 2a (18O-labeled 2a/total 2a) increased
with the reaction progress and was below 60% throughout the oxidation.
The 18O content extrapolated
at 2a yield = 0% was estimated to be almost zero, indicating
the oxidation with 16O supplied from the solid in the initial
stage and re-oxidation of the catalyst with 18O2. On the other hand, high 18O contents (73–87%)
were observed from the initial stage of the SMO-AA-catalyzed oxidation,
suggesting that the oxygen in 2a mainly originates from
gaseous O2. These results support that the SMO-catalyzed
oxidation of 1a likely involves the hydrogen atom abstraction
by O2-activated SMO.

The SMO-AA-catalyzed system was applicable to other substrates
(see eq 1). The oxidation
of xanthene (1b) proceeded efficiently with SMO-AA (81%
yield for 12 h) to afford the corresponding ketone (2b) in higher yield than the SMO-PC-catalyzed system (42% yield for
24 h).4 In the case of diphenylmethane
(1c), the oxidation product (2c) could be
obtained in 81% yield. The SMO-AA perovskite also efficiently catalyzed
the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline
(1d) to give 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (2d) in 94% yield. 1  

Conclusions
In conclusion, SMO with
high surface area was successfully synthesized
by the amino acid-aided method, which involves the formation of a
completely amorphous precursor from AA and metal acetates instead of metal nitrates. The
specific surface area of SMO-AA reached up to 47 m2 g–1, which is the highest value among the previously
reported SMO samples. The catalytic activity of SMO for heterogeneous
liquid-phase oxidation with O2 was significantly improved
and the SMO-AA-catalyzed system was applicable to the oxidation of
various substrates. This method does not require complicated operations
such as polymer gel formation and transformation processes. The simplicity
and versatility of the amino acid-aided method, by which metal oxide
nanomaterials including perovskites with various combinations of constituent
metals can be easily synthesized, are expected to contribute to the
development of efficient catalytic systems.

Instruments
XRD patterns were recorded on a diffractometer
(Ultima IV, Rigaku; Cu Kα, λ = 1.5405 Å, 40 kV to
40 mA) equipped with a high-speed one-dimensional detector (D/teX
Ultra; Rigaku). Diffraction data were collected in the range of 2θ
= 10–80° at 0.02° steps with a scan rate of 20°/min.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77
K with a surface area analyzer (Nova-4200e; Quantachrome). Prior to
measurement, the samples were heated at 423 K for 1 h under vacuum
to remove physisorbed water. The BET surface areas were estimated
over the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.30. IR spectra were obtained at a
resolution of 4 cm–1 using a spectrometer (FT/IR-6100;
Jasco) equipped with an extended KBr beam splitting device and a triglycine
sulfate (TGS) detector. A total of 64 scans were averaged for each
spectrum. The IR spectra of SMO were measured by KBr pellets containing
ca. 0.5 wt % of SMO. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) analyses were performed with a Shimadzu ICPS-8100 spectrometer.
DTA and thermogravimetric (TG) measurements were performed with a
differential thermal analyzer (TG8120; Rigaku). The morphology of
the samples was examined using FE-SEM (S-5500; Hitachi). Raman spectra
were recorded on a spectrometer (NRS-3200; Jasco) with excitation
at 532 nm using a green laser. TEM images were taken on a JEOL JEM2100F-HK-
transmission electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of
200 kV. Cu grids were directly mixed with samples, and the Cu grids
were collected and mounted on a stage. XPS analysis was performed
with JEOL JPC-9010 MC using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) at 10
kV and 25 mA. Samples were pressed into the pellet and fixed on a
double-stick carbon tape. The binding energies were calibrated using
the C 1s band at 284.6 eV. The spectrum was fitted and evaluated by
the XPS Peak 4.1 program, whereas the background was subtracted using
the Shirley function. The deconvoluted Mn 2p spectrum of SMO shows
three peaks with binding energies of 641.8, 642.8, and 644.5 eV, which
correspond to Mn(III), Mn(IV), and the shakeup peak, respectively.14 The deconvoluted O 1s spectrum of SMO shows
four peaks with binding energies of 529.2, 530.8, 531.8, and 533.3
eV, which correspond to lattice oxygen, surface OH group, defective
oxygen, and adsorbed H2O, respectively.9 H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles were measured on BEL Japan BELCAT-A at a heating rate
of 10 K min–1 from 303 to 1073 K under 5% H2/Ar flow (30 mL min–1). Liquid-phase catalytic
oxidation was performed with an organic synthesizer (ALHB-80 and DTC-200HZ-3000;
Techno Applications) or a liquid phase organic synthesizer (CHEMIST
PLAZA CP-1000; Sibata). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Biospin
Avance III spectrometer (1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) using 5 mm tubes.
Chemical shifts (δ) were reported in parts per million downfield
from SiMe4 (solvent, CDCl3). Gas chromatography (GC) analyses
were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2025 equipped with a Stabilwax capillary
column (internal diameter = 0.25 mm, length = 30 m) and a flame ionization
detector. Mass spectra were recorded on a spectrometer (GCMS-QP2010
SE; Shimadzu) equipped with an InertCap 17MS capillary column (internal
diameter = 0.25 mm, length = 30 m) at an ionization voltage of 70
eV.

SMO was synthesized as follows: Sr(OCOCH3)2·0.5H2O (5.64 g, 26.25 mmol), Mn(OCOCH3)2·4H2O (6.44 g, 26.25 mmol), and l-AA (10.48 g, 78.75
mmol) were dissolved in water (250 mL). The colorless solution was
evaporated to dryness at 343 K. The resulting pale pink powder was
dried at 463 K for 1 h to give a pale yellow powder (14.75 g), which
is referred to as the AA precursor. Based on the elemental analysis
and TG-DTA results, the formula for the AA precursor was estimated
to be SrMn(C4H5NO4)2(C4H7NO4)(CH3COOH). The AA precursor
was calcined at 823 K for 5 h in air, and analytically pure SMO-AA
was obtained. Yield: 4.65 g (93%). Elemental analysis: calcd (%) for
SrMnO3: Sr 45.98, Mn 28.83; found: Sr 46.08, Mn 27.33.
Perovskite SMO-AA could also be synthesized using d-AA instead
of l-AA.

Synthesis of SMO by Malic Acid-Aided Method
Perovskite
SMO-MA was synthesized according to the procedure for SMO-AA and modified
using malic acid instead of AA. The formula for the MA precursor was
estimated to be SrMn(C4H4O5)2(C4H4O4)(CH3COOH)0.5 on the basis of the elemental analysis and TG-DTA results.
Elemental analysis: calcd (%) for SrMnO3: Sr 45.98, Mn
28.83; found: Sr 48.33, Mn 28.82.

Synthesis of SMO with Other
Carboxylic Acids
Various
SMO samples with other carboxylic aids (S-lactic
acid, oxalic acid, and citric acid) were synthesized using the procedure
for SMO-AA modified by using carboxylic acid (3 equiv of the total
carboxylic group with respect to the total metal amount) instead of
AA.

Procedure for Catalytic Oxidation
The catalytic oxidation
of alkylarenes was conducted in a 30 mL glass vessel containing a
magnetic stirring bar. A typical procedure for catalytic oxidation
was as follows: SMO (0.1 g), fluorene (0.5 mmol), n-octane (2 mL), O2 (1 atm), and an internal standard (naphthalene)
were charged into the reaction vessel. The reaction solution was heated
at 353 K and periodically analyzed using GC. The products are known
and were identified by comparison of their 1H and 13C NMR signals with the literature data. After the reaction
was completed, the catalyst was recovered by filtration. The recovered
SMO-AA was washed with acetone (250 mL) and water (250 mL) and then
calcined at 723 K for 2 h before recycling.

18O-Labeling
Experiments
18O2 (>97% enriched)
was obtained from Isotec. Before the reaction,
the catalyst was evacuated at 423 K for 1 h and n-octane was degassed by freeze–pump–thaw cycling. The 18O-labeling experiment was carried out in a Schlenk flask
containing a magnetic stir bar. Catalyst (0.1 g), fluorene (0.5 mmol), n-octane (2 mL), and an internal standard (naphthalene)
were charged into the Schlenk flask under Ar atmosphere, followed
by the evacuation and the introduction of 97% of 18O2 (1 atm). The reaction solution was heated at 333 K and periodically
analyzed using GC and GC–MS. The 18O content in 2a was determined by using the ratio of the peak intensity
at m/z = 182 to the sum of the peak
intensities at m/z = 180 and 182.
