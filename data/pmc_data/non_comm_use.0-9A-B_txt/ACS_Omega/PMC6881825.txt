5-Fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine was synthesized by treating
5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine
with 2,4,6-trimethylphenol in the presence of 1-methylpyrrolidine
and trifluoroacetic anhydride, followed by aminolysis. Among N-acetyl, pivaloyl, and benzoyl, N-acetyl
was found to be suitable for the protection of the exocyclic amine
of 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine because of the stability of the N4-protected nucleoside under acidic conditions
and its ease of removal after solid-phase synthesis. This modified
nucleoside was incorporated into d(CG)6 sequences through
the phosphoramidite chemistry-based solid-phase synthesis. Circular
dichroism experiments suggest that replacement of 2′-deoxycytidine
with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine does not lead to detectable
conformational changes, either in the B- or Z-form. 19F
NMR spectroscopy of d(CG)6 containing 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine
revealed that B/Z-DNA transition induced by sodium chloride is likely
initiated at terminal ends, leading to unwinding at the middle of
duplexes, and eventual switch of handedness when sodium chloride concentration
reaches a threshold value.

Introduction
Among the chemical modifications of nucleic
acids, fluorination
has attracted immense interest because of the small size and electronegativity
of the fluorine atom and frequently favored pharmacological properties.1−4 While most efforts have focused on nucleosides with fluorine-containing
sugars, modification of purine and pyrimidine with fluorine has also
yielded useful properties.5 Of particular
note, introduction of fluorine into nucleic acids has enabled structural
studies via 19F NMR spectroscopy. On the one hand, fluorine
is small in size, and it is possible to predict conformational differences
with these modified nucleic acids; on the other hand, 19F is the only stable fluorine isotope with a large gyromagnetic ratio,
and fluorine chemical shifts are quite sensitive to conformational
changes. These features allow for the monitoring of conformational
changes in nucleic acids using 19F NMR spectroscopy.6 Of particular interest, Fujimoto and co-workers
demonstrated that incorporation of 5-trifluoromethyl-2′-deoxycytidine
into oligonucleotides allowed for the tracking of B-/Z-DNA transition
by 19F NMR spectroscopy.7 In
the present work, we wish to report the synthesis of 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine
(FdC 5) and its incorporation into oligonucleotides through
the phosphoramidite chemistry-based solid-phase synthesis, and subsequent
study of DNA handedness transition, that is, B- and Z-DNA, using 19F NMR spectroscopy.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine 5
While FdC was previously synthesized from 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine
(FdU 1) in 56% yield via a tetrazolide intermediate,8 the chemistry requires the use of 1H-tetrazole, which can be limited in practical synthesis because of
the thermal sensitivity of 1H-tetrazole and consequent
shipping restrictions.

Conversion of uracil nucleosides to the
corresponding cytosine nucleosides is well documented in the literature.
Two common approaches involve the formation of uracil 4-arylether
(such as 4-(p-nitrophenyl)ether 2) or
4-triazolide 3.9−11 Attempted syntheses of FdC 5 from FdU 1 through intermediates 2 or 3, however, were unsuccessful, leading only to the
recovery of starting material 1 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Reagents and conditions:
(i).
TMSCl, 1-methylpyrrolidine, p-nitrophenol, (CF3CO)2O, CH3CN, 0 °C, 4 h; (ii).
Ac2O, C5H5N, r.t., 12 h; (iii). POCl3, 1,2,3-triazole (for 3a, 2 h) or 1,2,4-triazole
(for 3b, 5 h); (iv). TMSCl, 1-methylpyrrolidine, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol,
(CF3CO)2O, CH3CN, 0 °C, 4 h;
v). aq. NH4OH, 65 °C, 24 h.

Conversion of FdU 1 into the transiently protected
2,4,6-trimethylphenyl ether 4 followed by aminolysis,
on the other hand, led to the isolation of the desired FdC 5 in 50% yield, with recovery of the starting material FdU 1 in 36% yield.

Choice of the Protecting Group for the Exocyclic Amine of FdC
While Fritz and co-workers8 incorporated
FdC into oligonucleotides using N-benzoyl-protected
FdC (N-Bz-FdC 6b), it was found by us
that N-Bz-FdC is unstable under the acidic conditions
required for the detritylation reaction in solid-phase synthesis.
Thus, N-acetyl-6a, N-benzoyl-6b, and N-pivaloyl-FdC 6c were prepared (Scheme 2) and evaluated for their suitability for solid-phase
synthesis.

Scheme 2 Reagents and conditions:
(i).
a. TMSCl, C5H5N; b. acyl chloride; c. aq. NEt3.

In order to incorporate FdC into
oligonucleotides, a suitable protecting
group for exocyclic amine is required. Thus, the stability of N-acyl FdC 6 under acidic and basic conditions
was evaluated. As detritylation reactions in solid-phase synthesis
are typically carried out by the treatment with di- or trichloroacetic
acid (DCA and TCA, respectively), the stability of N-4-protected FdC under these conditions is crucial. Such an N-4-acyl protecting group should also ensure the stability
of the oligonucleotide during the cleavage and deprotection stages
of solid-phase synthesis, typically under alkaline conditions. In
addition, the deprotection conditions should not lead to structural
modifications of oligonucleotides.

As solutions of DCA and TCA
are the most commonly used in the detritylation
step of solid-phase synthesis of oligonucleotides, the stability of N-acyl-FdC 6 was determined in 3% solutions
of each acid in methanol. Using an aqueous solution of KF sealed in
a capillary insert as an NMR internal standard, the progress of decomposition,
if any, was measured by the ratio of integrals of the two 19F signals in 19F NMR at appropriate intervals.

It
was found that N-Bz-FdC 6b and N-Piv-FdC 6c decompose instantaneously in DCA
and TCA (Table 1),
making N-benzoyl and pivaloyl groups unsuitable for
solid-phase synthesis. N-Ac-FdC 6a,
on the other hand, was found to be more stable, with a half-life of
4.13 h in 3% TCA, but stable in DCA after 24 h. As such, N-Ac-FdC 6a is compatible with the detritylation conditions
used in solid-phase synthesis, where the exposure time to TCA is as
little as 20 s per cycle on a 1 μmol scale.12

Table 1 Stability of N-Acyl-FdC
under Acidic Conditions
substance	acid (3%
in MeOH)	stability	
N-Bz-FdC 6b	TCA	instant decomposition	
N-Bz-FdC 6b	DCA	instant decomposition	
N-Piv-FdC 6c	TCA	instant decomposition	
N-Piv-FdC 6c	DCA	instant decomposition	
N-Ac-FdC 6a	TCA	4.13 h (half-life)	
N-Ac-FdC 6a	DCA	stable after 24 h	
Next, the lability of the N-acyl-protecting
groups
for FdC under basic conditions was determined by HPLC experiments.
Thus, N-acyl-FdC 6 was incubated in
appropriate alkaline solutions containing a suitable internal standard.
Aliquots were withdrawn at appropriate intervals for HPLC analysis.
The ratios of peak areas of the internal standard and N-acyl-FdC were used to determine the half-life of each N-acyl protecting group under respective alkaline conditions.

As can be seen in Table 2, N-Bz-FdC 6b undergoes deglycosylation
at 55 °C at pH 11. N-Piv-FdC 6c, however, is quite stable at pH 9 and 11 but almost completely deprotected
in concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature in
5 min. N-Ac-FdC 6a is more labile than N-Piv-FdC 6c, with a half-life of 51.3 and
21.8 h at pH 9 and 11, respectively, and virtually completely deprotected
in concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature in
5 min. To our surprise, N-Ac-FdC 6a was
deprotected by methanol quite effectively, with a half-life of 26.7
h at room temperature. Exposure to ethanol, propanol, and butanol,
however, did not lead to deacetylation of N-Ac-FdC.
Because of the instability of N-Ac-FdC in methanol,
ethanol was used, wherever necessary, in column chromatography for
the purification of N-Ac-FdC analogues.

Table 2 Lability of N-Acetyl-,
Benzoyl-, and Pivaloyl-FdC under Various Alkaline Conditions
substance	pH	temp. (°C)	half-life	
N-Bz-FdC 6b	11	55	deglycosylation

N-Ac-FdC 6a	conc. aq. NH4OH	22	<5 min (complete deprotection)	
N-Ac-FdC 6a	MeOH	22	26.7 h	
Considering the stability of N-acetyl-FdC 6a in acidic conditions and its ease of deprotection under
alkaline conditions, N-Ac-FdC 6a was
used in subsequent transformations.

Solid-Phase Synthesis of d(CG)6
To demonstrate
the utility of FdC in the structural elucidation of oligonucleotides, N-acetyl-FdC 6a was incorporated into oligonucleotides
by the phosphoramidite chemistry-based solid-phase synthesis. First,
5′-OH of N-Ac-FdC 6a was protected
with the dimethoxytrityl (DMTr) group, followed by the conversion
of 7 to the corresponding phosphoramidite 8 as a mixture of two diastereomers (Scheme 3), as indicated by 31P NMR spectroscopy.
It was found during the purification of 5′-O-DMTr-N-4-acetyl-FdC 7 by column chromatography
that the N-acetyl group in 6a and 7 is labile in the presence of triethylamine; thus, diisopropylethylamine
(Hünig’s base), instead of triethylamine, was used to
ensure the stability of 7 and 8 during column
chromatography.

(i).
DMTr-Cl, C5H5N; (ii). (CNCH2CH2O)P(Cl)N(i-Pr)2, (i-Pr)2NEt.

Six d(CG)6 sequences containing single FdC modification
at different positions were subsequently prepared by solid-phase synthesis
on an ABI DNA synthesizer on 1 μmol scales. After cleavages
from solid supports and deprotection, the oligonucleotides were characterized
by anion exchange HPLC and electrospray mass spectroscopy (Table 3).

Characterization of the B/Z-DNA Transition in FdC-modified d(CG)6 by Circular Dichroism
As one of the assumed advantages
of substitution at C-5 of deoxycytidine with fluorine is its small
size, minimal steric alteration is anticipated. As such, the FdC-modified
d(CG)6 sequences were annealed in low to high concentrations
of sodium chloride (0.1–4 M) and evaluated for their ability
to adopt B- and Z-duplexes and transition from B- to Z-form by circular
dichroism (CD), in comparison with the unmodified d(CG)6. As shown in Figure 1, the FdC-modified d(CG)6 sequences show the typical CD
profile for B-DNA in low concentration of sodium chloride but undergo
transition gradually to the Z-form with the increase of sodium chloride
concentration. In samples containing 4 M sodium chloride, all the
sequences show characteristic CD profiles for Z-DNA.13,14

Figure 1 CD
profiles of (a) unmodified d(CG)6; (b) d(CG)6-11F; and (c) d(CG)6-7F in varying concentrations
of NaCl.

Furthermore, the absorbances of these duplexes
at 260 and 290 nm
were recorded, and the A260/A290 ratios were plotted to determine the midpoint concentration
of sodium chloride required for the B → Z DNA transition. As
shown in Table 3, d(CG)6 sequences containing a single FdC modification have midpoint
concentrations of NaCl required for B → Z-DNA transition very
similar to that of the unmodified d(CG)6 (2.6 M), which
is close to the literature value (2.5 M).15 These results are in agreement with the above CD observation, confirming
that FdC introduces minimal distortion to the overall DNA structures.
Incorporation of FdC into d(CG)6 appears to slightly increase
the duplex stability in the B-form, as indicated by the slightly higher
melting temperature (Tm in 20 mM NaCl, Table 3).

Use of FdC as a Probe to Study B → Z-DNA Transition
While B-type duplex is the dominant form of DNA in biological systems,
the left-handed Z-DNA has been found to also exist under certain conditions,
such as elevated salt concentrations and torsional stress.14−16 Despite over 40 years of investigation, numerous questions about
Z-DNA remain. Of these, concrete evidence is still lacking with respect
to the detailed structural changes in B → Z-transition, despite
various hypotheses put forward primarily through theoretical articulation.17 As 19F NMR shifts are quite sensitive
to structural changes, this form of spectroscopy has been found to
be useful in the investigation of protein and nucleic acid structures
and interactions.6

Examination of
the 19F NMR spectra (Figure 2a–f) of d(CG)6-11F reveals a clear
trend of chemical shifts. In 20 mM sodium chloride, where the DNA
duplex is presumed to adopt B-form DNA as indicated by the CD spectrum,
two close 19F signals at −164.1 ppm are observed.
As the concentration of sodium chloride reaches 4 M, a condition under
which this duplex was established by CD spectroscopy to exist in the
Z-DNA form, the 19F NMR signals shifted toward up-field.
A gradual shift of the 19F resonance from −164 to
−166 pm corroborates the B- to Z-transition with the increase
of sodium chloride concentration from 20 mM to 4 M.

DNA duplexes. The bold blue arrows in the cartoons indicate unwinding
of duplexes and the “bubbles” correspond to unpaired
regions. Concentrations of the modified d(CG)6 were between
0.23 and 0.58 mM.

The changes in 19F NMR chemical shifts
depicted in Figure 2a–f support
a model for the B → Z-DNA transition, where B-DNA duplex unwinds
from termini as the salt concentration increases, leading to eventual
switching of handedness when the salt concentration reaches a threshold
value. This model is in agreement with the 19F NMR spectra
of the d(CG)6-7F: d(CG)6 duplex (Figure 2a′–f′),
which was annealed by mixing d(CG)6-7F and d(CG)6 in a 1:5 ratio. In this case, changes in 19F shifts only
became significant when sodium chloride concentration reaches 3 M
(Figure 2c′),
further supporting the scenario where unwinding of interior occurs
after the duplex unwinds at the termini.

Further investigation
of the FdC-modified d(CG)6 by 1H NMR revealed
that incorporation of FdC appears to affect
hydrogen bonds. As shown in the 1H NMR of unmodified d(CG)6 and those modified with FdC at 7 and 11 positions (Figure 3, samples were prepared
in H2O–D2O, 9:1 v/v, at 0.4 mM), the
NH protons in the most downfield region that are typically found in
hydrogen bonding display different chemical shifts, suggesting disruptions
to hydrogen bonding by FdC.

in Tris-HCl (10 mM,
pH 7.5 containing 20 mM NaCl) at a 0.4 mM (ssDNA) concentration.

Conclusions
FdC 5 was successfully synthesized
from FdU 1. N-Acetyl was found to be
a suitable protecting
group for FdC for the incorporation of this modified nucleoside into
oligonucleotides through the phosphoramidite chemistry-based solid-phase
synthesis. Compared with unmodified d(CG)6, oligonucleotides
containing a single FdC modification showed very little difference
in CD profiles both in the B- and Z-forms, indicating minimal distortions
of DNA duplexes by this fluorinated nucleoside. 19F NMR
spectroscopy of d(CG)6 duplexes containing FdC at varying
sodium chloride concentrations suggested that B → Z-DNA transition
is likely initiated by the unwinding of duplex at termini, leading
to switches of handedness with the increase of sodium chloride concentration.

Overall, FdC has the potential to be used as a versatile probe
for DNA structures and interactions with other molecules. The possibility
of disruptions to hydrogen bonding by FdC should, however, be considered.

were eluted with water/acetonitrile mixtures at a flow rate of 0.7
mL/min. Anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography was
carried out on a DNAPac 200 column (4 × 250 mm) using a denaturing
elution condition (containing 4 M urea at pH 12.4 and linear gradient
elution with NaCl).18

Solvents and Chemicals
Toluene was dried by heating
under reflux over sodium metal in the presence of benzophenone for
4 h and then distilled. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidine, pyridine, and acetonitrile were dried by heating
over calcium hydride and then distilled. Dichloromethane was dried
by heating under reflux over phosphorus pentoxide and then distilled.
All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI without
further purification prior to use unless stated otherwise.

Oligonucleotide Synthesis
Oligonucleotides were synthesized
using an ABI 3400 DNA synthesizer on 1 μmol scales using the
standard 1 μmol cycle conditions. Phosphoramidites were prepared
as 100 mM solutions in dry acetonitrile. 5-(Ethylthio)-1H-tetrazole (250 mM in dry acetonitrile) was used as the activator
and coupling reactions were allowed for 60 s. Detritylation was carried
out by delivering trichloroacetic acid (3% in dichloromethane) for
110 s. After the solid-phase synthesis was complete, the products
were incubated with concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide (28%)
at 55 °C for 14 h. After lyophilization, the products were passed
through Amberlite IR120 resin in the sodium form. The products were
found by anion exchange HPLC to contain 92–96% full length
sequences.

Synthesis of 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine 5
5-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 1 (5.00 g,
20.3 mmol) was dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 3 h and then suspended
in dry acetonitrile (150 mL). Chlorotrimethylsilane (7.76 mL, 60.9
mmol), followed by N-methylpyrrolidine (16.86 mL,
0.163 mol) were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1
h at room temperature; upon cooling (ice-water bath), trifluoroacetic
anhydride (8.47 mL, 60.9 mmol) was added dropwise over 5 min. After
30 min, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (8.30 g, 60.9 mmol) was added and the
reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 3 h. Aqueous ammonium
hydroxide (25 mL, 28%) was added and the flask was sealed and heated
at 65 °C for 24 h. Upon cooling, the products were evaporated
to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by
column chromatography on silica gel. The appropriate fractions, which
were eluted with dichloromethane/methanol (93:7 v/v), were combined
and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title
compound as a pale orange solid (2.98 g, 60%). The starting
material 1 (1.80 g, 36%) was also recovered. Rf (System C): 0.28. HR-MS (EI) found 245.0806,

Synthesis of N-Acetyl-5-fluoro-5′-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-2′-deoxycytidine
7
N-Acetyl-5-fluoro-2′-deoxycutidine 6a (1.70 g, 5.92 mmol) was co-evaporated with dry pyridine
(3 × 10 mL) and then taken up in dry pyridine (15 mL), followed
by addition of 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl chloride (3.00 g, 8.85
mmol). After the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 45 min, a triethylamine/ethanol (1:1 v/v) mixture (3.5 mL) was
added. The products were diluted with dichloromethane (100 mL) and
extracted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (35 mL). The layers
were separated and the aqueous layer was back-extracted with dichloromethane
(30 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (MgSO4)
and evaporated to dryness. The oily residue was purified by column
chromatography on silica gel. The appropriate fractions, which were
eluted with dichloromethane/ethanol/triethylamine (98.2:1.5:0.3 v/v/v),

N-Acetyl-5-fluoro-5′-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-2′-deoxycitidine 7 (1.00 g, 1.70 mmol) was co-evaporated with dry toluene (3
× 10 mL) and then dissolved in dry dichloromethane (20 mL). Dry N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.5 mL, 8.6
mmol), followed by (2-cyanoethyl)-N,N-diisopropyl phosphochloridite (0.66 g, 2.8 mmol) were added, and
the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (1.0 mL) was
added and the products were evaporated under reduced pressure. The
residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The appropriate
fractions, which were eluted with hexane/acetone/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (70:28:2 v/v), were combined

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
CD samples were prepared
by dissolving oligonucleotides (10 μM) in Tris-HCl buffer (10
mM, pH 7.5) and NaCl (0.02–4 M) in autoclaved miliQ water.
Oligonucleotides were annealed on a Mastercycler Nexus gradient thermal
cycler by heating to 95 °C over 10 min followed by slow cooling
to 25 °C over a period of 50 min.

UV/Vis Spectroscopy
The absorbance of annealed oligonucleotides
was measured at 260 and 290 nm on a Genesys 10S UV–Vis Spectrophotometer.
Samples were prepared in the same manner as those used for CD measurement.

Tm Measurement
Oligonucleotides
were prepared at 5 μM (ssDNA) in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH
7.5, containing 20 mM NaCl) annealed in a Mastercycler Nexus gradient
thermal cycler by first heating to 95 °C, followed by slow cooling
to 25 °C over a period of 35 min. Melting temperatures were measured
using a Cary 3000 UV/vis spectrophotometer. The temperature was increased
by 1 °C/min.

19F NMR Spectroscopy
An appropriate amount
of oligonucleotides with sodium cations was reconstituted in a Tris-HCl
buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5, 0.5 mL in deuterium oxide) containing appropriate
concentration of NaCl (0.02–4 M) and 0.01 μM of sodium
trifluoroacetate (as an internal standard for 19F NMR). 19F NMR spectra were processed by applying the linear backward
prediction algorithm in order to eliminate background signals from
NMR tubes.19
