Synthetic
peptides mimicking the binding site of fertilin β
to its receptor, integrin α6β1, were shown to inhibit
sperm–egg fusion when added to in vitro media. In contrast,
the synthetic cyclic hexapeptide, cyclo(Cys1-Ser2-Phe3-Glu4-Glu5-Cys6),
named as cFEE, proved to stimulate gamete fusion. Owing to its biological
specificity, this hexapeptide could help improve the in vitro fertilization
pregnancy rate in human. In an attempt to establish the structure–activity
relationship of cFEE, its structural dynamics was herein analyzed
by means of ultraviolet circular dichroism (UV-CD) and Raman scattering.
The low concentration CD profile in water, containing mainly a deep
minimum at ∼202 nm, is consistent with a rather unordered chain.
However, an ordering trend of the peptide loop has been observed in
a less polar solvent such as methanol, where the UV-CD signal shape
is formed by a double negative marker at ∼202/215 nm, indicating
the presence of a type-II′ β-turn. Raman spectra recorded
in aqueous samples upon a 100-fold concentration increase, still showed
an important population (∼30%) of the disordered structure.
The structural flexibility of the disulfide bridge was confirmed by
the Raman markers arising from the Cys1-Cys6 disulfide bond-stretch motions. Density functional theory calculations
highlighted the formation of the type-II′ β-turn on the
four central residues of cFEE (i.e., -Ser2-Phe3-Glu4-Glu5-) either with a left- or with a
right-handed disulfide. The structure with a left-handed S–S
bond, however, appears to be more stable.

==== Body
Introduction
fertilin β, also
known as ADAM2, is part of a disintegrin
and metalloprotease (ADAM) family of proteins. ADAMs are widely expressed
with various functions in cell–cell and cell–matrix
interaction. Their common feature is to express a disintegrin-like
domain that could bind to receptors like integrins,1 a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors composed
of covalently linked and β subunits. Fertilin β is located
on spermatozoa, whereas its binding receptor the integrin 6β1
is located on oocytes. Numerous studies have highlighted the importance
of the binding between fertilin β and integrin 6β1 in
the sperm–egg binding process, allowing their fusion.2,3 Indeed, in vitro studies showed that sperm–egg fusion is
greatly reduced when the interaction between fertilin β and
integrin 6β1 is specifically inhibited. Such inhibition was
performed by adding to in vitro media, synthetic peptides mimicking
the binding site of the fertilin β (e.g., the disintegrin domain),
so that they act as a competitor.3−7 Therefore, the binding between fertilin β and integrin 6β1
was identified as a crucial step for egg–sperm fusion. However,
attempts based on using gene knockout experiments have revealed that
several sperm factors identified from the in vitro system are in fact
not essential for in vivo fertilization.8 Indeed, fertilization was proven to be still possible when genes
of fertilin β are deleted.9−11 Fertilin β is actually
believed to play a role in sperm transport in the oviduct rather than
in sperm–oocyte fusion.8 Nevertheless,
regardless of its activity concerning the in vivo fertilization process,
it is clear that the inhibition of the fertilin β binding to
α6β1 inhibits egg–sperm fusion in vitro, thus becoming
crucial importance upon the consideration of the in vitro fertilzation
(IVF) approach.

The binding sequence of fertilin β is
species specific. In
human, this sequence corresponds to -Phe-Glu-Glu- (or FEE).12 Ziyyat et al.13 evaluated
the role of fertilin β in human gamete fusion, by using a peptide
reproducing its binding site to integrin 6β1. As the binding
domain of fertilin β is localized at the top of a hairpin loop,
to reproduce its natural conformation, a cyclic hexapeptide, NH2-CSFEEC-COOH (cyclic part underlined),
hereafter referred to as cFEE, was used. Unexpectedly, while most
peptides and recombinant forms of fertilin inhibit sperm–egg
fusion, cFEE was shown to lead to an increase of the gamete fusion.13 In fact, cFEE was shown to bind to the oocyte
membrane, simulating spermatozoon contact by inducing the displacement
of the adhesion protein to the oocyte surface. Similar results were
observed upon a clinical trial on mice by the use of the mouse sequence
equivalent to cFEE (cQDE), leading to the improved IVF pregnancy rate
in mice.14 It has been thought that this
specific biological effect of cFEE in vitro might be explained by
both its amino acid composition and cyclic structure maintained by
a disulfide bridge between its two terminal cysteines.13,14 Nevertheless, a convincing explanation has not yet been provided.

Therefore, it appeared to us interesting to analyze the structural
dynamics of this cyclic hexapeptide to help understand its specific
action (vide supra) that can be envisaged in IVF pregnancy rate improvement
in human. On the other hand, the knowledge of the conformational features
of cFEE might lead to design other peptides with higher IVF success
rates. Herein, at a first stage of these investigations, the structural
analysis of cFEE has been undertaken by means of optical spectroscopic
techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) and Raman scattering. During
the past decade, the joint use of these approaches has rendered possible
the analysis of the structural properties of both linear and cyclic
peptides in aqueous media as a function of their length, concentration,
as well as of the ionic strength, pH, and time.15−21 Furthermore, in many cases, the role of the surrounding solvent,
in going from high to low dielectric media, favoring the intermolecular
interactions rather than those from the intramolecular type has also
been elucidated.15−18 As concerns about the cyclic peptides, while CD spectra give rapid
and general information on their folding type, Raman spectra provide
details on the rate of different secondary structural elements (disordered,
turn, and strand) appearing in their closed part.19−22

Results and Discussion
LC-MS/MS
Analysis
The characterization based on reverse
phase liquid chromatography hyphenated to high-resolution tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was made with the aim of providing orthogonal
information regarding the integrity of the cyclic peptide and to eventually
identify the presence of interfering impurities. Considering the obtained
chromatogram, the presence of the hexapeptide cFEE was confirmed.
[M + H]+ was observed at 715.2051 (Figure S1A, Supporting Information), with a mass deviation
from the theoretical value not exceeding 2.5 ppm. This represents
conventionally the instrumental performance. The present data with
previous ones24 and the resolution provided
by the MS instrument allowed elucidating the isotopic distribution
of cFEE, being in complete correlation with its cyclic structure.

Concomitantly, during the analysis, fragmentation by collision-induced
dissociation (CID) was performed to investigate more precisely the
structure of the compound. As illustrated in Figure S1B (Supporting Information), MS/MS spectra corresponding to
cFEE mainly demonstrated the detection of the fragments corresponding
to the b-ion series. The identified fragments demonstrated to be particularly
consistent with the amino acid sequence of the cFEE peptide. Except
cFEE, the investigation of LC-MS/MS data did not reveal the presence
of any additional compound, thus excluding the presence of probable
impurities.

UV-CD Markers
UV-CD spectra recorded
at 300 μM
in methanol and water are displayed in traces A and B of Figure 1, respectively. Upon
comparison, the effect of the solvent type on the observed spectra
can be clearly seen on CD spectra. In both media, all the spectra
are mainly characterized by a deep minimum at ∼202 nm. However,
in methanol (Figure 1A), a distinct shoulder at ∼215 nm was detected at the long
wavelength side of the main minimum. On the contrary, the pH effect
(from acidic toward neutral pH, Figure 1B) is reflected by an overall decrease of the negative
band at ∼202 nm, as well as an increase of the positive signal
at ∼220 nm, without changing the overall dichroic shape of
the CD spectra. It can be reminded that the pKa corresponding to the Glu side-chain protonation/deprotonation
is ∼4.1. As a result, the two selected pH values favor as major
population either the protonated (pH 3) or the deprotonated (pH 7)
side chains of Glu4 and Glu5 residues.

UV-CD spectra of cFEE displayed in the 190–280
nm region. (A) Data recorded in methanol at 200 μM. (B) Data
recorded in aqueous samples at 300 μM as a function of pH.

The influence of the solvent polarity on the peptide
structural
features has been detailed previously.15,16 Some linear
peptides were reported to undergo a β-strand → α-helix
transition from water (a polar solvent) to another having a lower
dielectric constant (alcohols). This effect has been interpreted by
the capacity of a polar solvent to reinforce the intermolecular H-bonds,
rather than the intramolecular ones.15 Beyond
the solvent polarity, the influence of peptide length, concentration,
and eventually its exposure time to the solvent appeared to act as
the key structuring elements.16−18 In cyclic peptides, the closure
constraint (imposed for instance by a disulfide bond), the length,
and the amino acid composition of its closed part were shown to be
the key elements in their structural behaviors.19−21

Focusing
on UV-CD structural markers, a random chain is routinely
characterized by a deep negative dichroic band at ∼198 nm,25,26 whereas a loosely structured loop (i.e., subjected to a rapid interconversion
of several instable turns) provides a slightly red-shifted negative
CD signal to ∼202 nm.19 As a consequence,
the characteristic CD fingerprint of cFEE in water, independently
of the pH value (Figure 1B), is consistent with the formation of an unordered/weakly ordered
turn, whereas the double negative band shape reveals the presence
of a structured loop formed in methanol (Figure 1A). Previously, upon an extensive study of
the CD and NMR data obtained from 10 gramicidin S cyclic peptides,
all adopting a reverse type-II′ β-turn, it has been highlighted
that their CD profile is composed of a double negative bands at ∼202
and ∼215 nm. Furthermore, the dichroic ratio [Φ2]/[Φ1], where [Φ2] and [Φ1] are the normalized ellipticities corresponding to the higher
(∼215 nm) and lower (∼202 nm) wavelength components
of the characteristic double negative CD fingerprint, respectively,
can be taken as an indicator of their β-turn stability.27 More precisely, while a compact (or highly stable)
type-II′ β-turn gives a [Φ2]/[Φ1] ratio close to unity,21 a less
stable turn of the same family provides a lower (<1) ratio. Following
these evidences, the CD band shape of cFEE (Figure 1A), with a [Φ2]/[Φ1] ratio of ∼0.4, is consistent with a rather instable
(mobile) type-II′ β-turn in methanol. Other types of
β-turns provide, noteworthy, a CD signal different from those
observed in cFEE. For instance, a type-I β-turn is characterized
by double minima at ∼208/222 nm, resembling that traditionally
assigned to an α-helix, a type-II β-turn gives a positive
band located within the 190–210 nm region, and finally, a reverse
type-I′ β-turn provides a broad negative band at ∼215
nm.25

Raman Markers
Raman spectra of cFEE, recorded at 30
mM in the middle wavenumber region in aqueous samples, are displayed
in traces A and B of Figure 2 corresponding to pH 3 and 7, respectively. To achieve a reliable
assignment of the observed Raman bands, we resorted to those from
their building blocks. For this, the Raman spectra of free Ser, Phe,
and Glu are shown in Figure 3A–D. Because of their full analysis in both solid and
solution samples,28 the Raman data of cysteine
(i.e., Cys-Cys dimer with a disulfide bond) were not reported here.
Selected pH values of the solution samples of free AAs favored their
zwitterionic species (with NH3+/COO– backbone end groups). This fact can be verified for instance by
the broad band at ∼1602 cm–1 corresponding
to the carboxylate (COO–) asymmetric stretching
mode (Figure 3A,C,D).
Because of the absence of any internal reference, to facilitate their
comparison, all spectra were normalized to their intensities in the
1500–1400 cm–1 region, arising from the aliphatic
modes (angular bending motions of CH2 groups). The strongest
Raman bands naturally correspond to the Phe aromatic markers located
at 1606, 1586, 1207, 1032, 1004, and 622 cm–1 (Figure 3B). It is interesting
to note that the spectrum of Glu0 species (with a protonated
side chain) recorded at an acidic pH (2.9) clearly reveals the presence
of the broad band at ∼1723 cm–1 assignable
to the carbonyl (C=O) bond-stretch marker resulting from the
side-chain head group (COOH) (Figure 3D). At pH 6, upon the predominance of Glu1– species in the solution (with a deprotonated side-chain head group
COO–), the carbonyl marker expectedly vanishes (Figure 3C). The comparison
between the spectra of Glu0 and Glu1– species permits locating the markers affected by the side-chain
protonation/deprotonation within three distinct regions, that is,
1730–1700, 1350–1300, and 950–850 cm–1 (bands marked by pink arrows in Figure 3C,D). For the detailed assignment of the
Raman bands, see refs (29) and (30) for Phe
and ref (31) for Ser.
As far as Glu is concerned, we present in Table S1 (Supporting Information) the theoretical wavenumbers of
the main Raman bands along with their assignments from the presently
performed DFT calculations on the lowest energy conformers of both
Glu1– and Glu0 species (Figure 3G,H) (see also Results and Discussion for details). In particular, the Raman
markers shown by pink arrows in Figure 3C,D are assigned to a mixture of side-chain/backbone
vibrational motions, thus explaining their sensitivity to the side-chain
head group COOH → COO– conversion.

regions. The characteristic Raman bands sensitive to the Glu side-chain

The Raman bands observed in free AAs allowed us to propose in Figure 2A,B the tentative
assignment of cFEE spectra. Whatever pH, the Raman intensity is expectedly
dominated by that arising from Phe3. Nevertheless, the
relative intensity of Glu markers is strong enough to permit appreciation
of the changes occurring upon side-chain protonation/deprotonation
(see medium bands marked by pink arrows in Figure 2A,B). For instance, the appearance of a shoulder
at ∼1727 cm–1 at pH 3 should be noticed (Figure 2A), vanishing at
pH 7 (Figure 2B). In
the 950–900 cm–1 region, the broad and dissymmetric
band peaking at ∼941 cm–1 at pH 7 (Figure 2B) is transformed
to a set of partially resolved bands at ∼933, 922, and 906
cm–1 at pH 3 (Figure 2A).

The comparison between the Raman spectra
of cFEE (Figure 2A,B)
and those from free AAs
(Figure 3A–D)
also allows analyzing the vibrations arising from the peptide backbone,
referred to as amide I (1750–1625 cm–1) and
amide III (1320–1225 cm–1) modes. Both amide
regions involve broad and barely resolved bands, consistent with the
presence of several secondary structural elements in cFEE. Band decomposition
in amide (I and III) regions (Figure 4) leads us to achieve
detailed structural information. The protocol used for band decomposition
was established on the basis of the previous works on linear16−18 and cyclic19−22 peptides. Table 1 shows the normalized contributions (as expressed in percent) of
the band components at pH 3 (Figure 4A,C) and pH 7 (Figure 4B,D). Comparable results were obtained from amide (I
and III) regions, confirming the reliability of band decomposition
and corresponding assignments. As far as the influence of pH is concerned,
apart from a slight decrease of ordered elements (turn and β-strand)
versus a slight increase of random chain contribution, no other perceptible
effect can be noticed in going from an acidic toward a neutral pH
value (Table 1).

sum of the components. See text for details and Table 1 for normalized contributions and their assignments
to different secondary structural elements (random, β-strand,
and turn). Note that the component at 1721 cm–1 (pink
color in (A)) arises from the stretching mode of the carbonyl bond
appearing upon the Glu side-chain protonation at pH 3.

The 550–480 cm–1 region of the Raman spectra
involving the S–S bond stretching vibrations is zoomed in Figure 5. Independently of
the pH value, band decomposition makes clearly appear two components
at ∼509 and ∼525 cm–1, assignable
to two different types of rotamers around the S–S linkage in
cFEE (see for details ref (28)); the normalized area corresponding to these two components
is estimated as ∼80% (for the ∼509 cm–1 component) versus ∼20% (for the ∼525 cm–1 component). Although the rotamer relative to the ∼509 cm–1 component should correspond to the major disulfide
rotamer in aqueous solution, the presence of the second component
at ∼525 cm–1 with lower intensity reveals
the conformational flexibility of the S–S linkage.

Type-II′ β-Turn Structural Models for cFEE
UV-CD spectra led us to presume that a loosely structured type-II′
β-turn can be formed in methanol (see above UV-CD Markers for details). It is worth emphasizing that there
exist two reverse type β-turns, referred to as type-I′
and type-II′. Both of them are considered as frequently occurring
β-turns in proteins.36,37 Briefly, a β-turn
is composed of four residues, generally numbered as i, i + 1, i + 2, and i + 3 in which the chain direction change is made possible by the
special values of the backbone torsion angles (φ, ψ) assigned
to the two middle i + 1 and i +
2 residues.32,33 Particularly, in a type-II′
β-turn, the mentioned angles fluctuate around the following
mean values (φi+1 ∼ +60°,
ψi+1 ∼ −120°,
φi+2 ∼ −80°,
ψi+2 ∼ 0°).

To
prepare the initial conformers of cFEE, we took an advantage of the
extensive structural data corresponding to a synthetic cyclic octapeptide,
named octreotide (or Sandostatin). Octreotide with the primary sequence
Nter-D-Phe1-cyclo(Cys2-Phe3-D-Trp4-Lys5-Thr6-Cys7)-Thr(ol)8 is one of the rare therapeutic peptides for which crystal,34 NMR,35 CD, and Raman20,22 data, as well as DFT calculations,36 are
available. All these data confirm a type-II′ β-turn formed
on the four central residues (-Phe3-D-Trp4-Lys5-Thr6-) of this peptide. Supposing that a similar
turn can also be formed on the four central residues of cFEE (-Ser2-Phe3-Glu4-Glu5-), the backbone
torsion angles (φ, ψ, ω) of octreotide36 were transferred to the initial structure of
cFEE. As far as the torsion angles defining the orientation of the
side chains of Ser2, Phe3, Glu4,
and Glu5 are concerned, we resorted to the DFT data existing
on free AAs reported either in the previous investigations on Phe37 and Ser31 or derived
from the presently performed calculations on Glu. The lowest energy
conformers of Ser, Phe, Glu0, and Glu1– are displayed in Figure 3E–H, respectively. At the right side of each conformer,
the values of their side-chain torsion angles, that is, (χ1, χ2) for Ser and Phe and (χ1, χ2, χ3) for Glu. As far as the
cysteine (Cys1-Cys6) conformation is concerned,
we were inspired from a systematic structural analysis on the functional
disulfide bridges in proteins.38−41 The conclusion of this study was that a set of five
torsion angles (χ1, χ2, χ3, χ2′, χ1′)
defined around the five chemical bonds (−Cα–Cβ–S–S–Cβ′–Cα′−)
along the cysteine moiety are necessary to accurately define the conformational
feature of a given S–S bridge. The torsion angles involved
in the optimized structure of octreotide were (χ1 = −166°, χ2 = +73°, χ3 = −97°, χ2′ = +111°,
χ1′ = −179°).36 It is to be noted that this set of torsion angles corresponds
to a left-handed S–S bridge because of the negative sign assigned
to the χ3 angle defined around the S–S bond.
To analyze the effect of the S–S bridge handedness, we have
also constructed a second initial conformer having a right-handed
S–S linkage (having a positive χ3 angle).

The optimized geometries of cFEE having either a left-handed (L)
or a right-handed (R) disulfide linkage are reported in Figure 6A,B, respectively. Note that
in both structures, Glu4 and Glu5 have a protonated
side chain, reflecting a low dielectric constant environment such
as methanol. For the same reason, the peptide backbone end groups
were supposed to be neutral (NH2/COOH). The optimized torsion
angles of these conformers are reported in Table 2. As it can be seen, the type-II′
β-turn can be stabilized both with a left- or a right-handed
disulfide. Nonetheless, a higher stability (with a lower relative
energy) was predicted for the (L) structure (Figure 6). The interactions that stabilize both (L)
and (R) structures are to be noticed as follows: (i) a quite short
contact in the peptide backbone, (Ser2)N–H···O–C(Glu5), with a length varying between 2.02 and 2.20 Å, acting
as the β-turn closing the H-bond and (ii) a set of three other
H-bonds involving the side-chain head groups of Ser2 (O–H),
Glu5 (COOH), as well as the backbone carbonyl C=O
(Ser2) and N–H (Glu5) groups (with the
lengths varying between 1.99 and 2.23 Å). To better appreciate
the (L) and (R) rotamers of the S–S bridge, the cysteine moiety
(Cys1-Cys6) is zoomed in Figure 7, along with the values of their characteristic
torsion angles (χ1, χ2, χ3, χ2′, χ1′).
Following the original terminology initiated by Hogg and co-workers,38 the optimized left-handed disulfide bridge can
be considered as a “-LHStaple”-type rotamer (Figure 7C), whereas the right-handed
one is rather a “-RHHook”-type rotamer (Figure 7D). In these notations, “LH”
and “RH” designate left-handed and right-handed disulfides,
respectively. “Staple” and “Hook” refer
to their spatial shapes, and finally, the sign “-” reflects
the negative values assigned to the terminal χ1 and
χ1′ torsion angles. It is worth noting that
there also exists a traditional type of notation for defining the
S–S bridge conformation, based on the g (gauche) and t (trans)
orientations of the three middle torsion angles (χ2, χ3, χ2′), without mentioning
their signs. Following these notations, the left-handed S–S
bridge corresponds to a “ggg” conformer, whereas the
right-handed one can be classified as a “ggt” conformer.
For further use of the optimized structures, the corresponding atomic
Cartesian coordinates are reported in Table S2.

For the graphical representations,
see Figure 6. Torsion
angles
are expressed in degrees. φ, ψ, and ω refer to the
backbone torsion angles of the residues involved in the structure
of the hexapeptide.χ1, χ2, and χ3 torsion angles allow the orientation of the side chain of
a given residue to be determined. Asterisk (*) corresponds to side-chain
torsion angles of the cysteine (Cys1-Cys6) moiety
that are reported in Figure 7 along with the corresponding graphical representation of
the disulfide bridge.

Comparison
with Other Cyclic Peptides
To better understand
the structural behavior of cFEE, we briefly compare it to that of
other short cyclic peptides having preferentially an identical loop
size. The natural hormone oxytocin, Nter-cyclo(Cys1-Tyr2-Ile3-Gln4-Asn5-Cys6)-Pro7-Leu8-Gly9-CONH2, was provided in TFE (εr = 8.55),42 a UV-CD profile similar to that obtained from cFEE in methanol
(Figure 1A). In water
(pH 7.3), its CD signal was rather consistent with an unordered chain.43 Another structurally similar hormone, Arg-vasopressin,
Nter-cyclo(Cys1-Tyr2-Phe3-Gln4-Asn5-Cys6)-Pro7-Arg8-Gly9-CONH2, was shown to be unstructured in an aqueous
environment (pH 6.9) as characterized by a deep negative CD profile
peaking below 200 nm.44 In other words,
both mentioned neuropeptides presented a structural dynamics close
to that of cFEE. Taking into account the fact that all three peptides
possess a loop formed by six residues, their common structural features
should undoubtedly arise from their amino acid composition and especially
from those of the four loop residues, that is, -Tyr2-Ile3-Gln4-Asn5- (in oxytocin), -Tyr2-Phe3-Gln4-Asn5- (in Arg-vasopressin),
and -Ser2-Phe3-Glu4-Glu5- (in cFEE). It is worth noting that all three sequences contain
at least three residues with a pronounced hydrophilic character (selected
among Ser, Tyr, Asn, Gln, and Glu residues). Recent DFT calculations
highlighted the propensity of Phe and Tyr residues to be hydrated
through the stabilization of short contacts between water hydrogen
atoms and aromatic π-electron systems.37 Nevertheless, the main structural difference between cFEE and the
two mentioned neuropeptides seems to be in the handedness of their
S–S bonds. In fact, previous Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements
led to the conclusion that oxytocin and Arg-vasopressin contain both
a right-handed S–S bond,45 whereas
the presently reported DFT calculations in methanol are consistent
with a left-handed S–S bond as the major rotamer of cFEE (see
above for details).

Structural Argument Put Forward for Explaining
the Particular
Biological Activity of cFEE
As the culture media for IVF
is an aqueous media with a pH at 7.3, the reason behind the particular
biological behavior of cFEE (see Introduction for details) might be dependent on its unordered character. To support
this hypothesis on the structure–activity relationship of therapeutic
peptides, we can mention the example of the natural hormone somatostatin-14
(SST-14), acting particularly as an inhibitor of the growth hormone
secretion through its binding to one of the five G-protein-coupled
receptors, referred to as SSTRi (i = 1,...,5).46 SST-14 is a cyclic tetradecapeptide
with a large size loop formed by 12 residues. This hormone was shown
to form an unordered chain, as confirmed by CD, Raman,19,21,22 and NMR data.47−49 Apart from
its loop size, the conformational flexibility of SST-14 can be related
to the presence of seven intraloop hydrophilic residues. Because of
the plasma short half-life of SST-14, during the past decades, a series
of synthetic analogues were elaborated and used in various somatostatin-based
clinical therapies.50,51 Among them, one can notice two
widely spread cyclic octapeptides, octreotide and lanreotide, both
forming a stable type-II′ β-turn on their four central
residues.20,21 Interestingly, these two analogues have
shown a selective binding affinity toward two SST-14 receptors, that
is, SSTR2 and SSTR5. The difference between the activities of SST-14
and its synthetic analogues might be better understood by their structural
features. More explicitly, while SST-14 with its loose turn can equivalently
interact with its five receptors presumably through an induced fit
process,52 the conformational restriction
leads to considerably modulate its analogue activity.

Concluding
Remarks
Because of the rapidity in acquisition and post-treatment
of their
data, the joint use of UV-CD and Raman spectra is now considered as
a powerful method to probe the solution structural dynamics of the
peptides, especially when they are unordered or barely structured.
Herein, the application of this methodology evidenced that the cyclic
therapeutic peptide cFEE adopts a rather unordered loop in aqueous
media, without a perceptible structural transition from an acidic
to a neutral pH value, being responsible for the side-chain protonation/deprotonation
of its two adjacent Glu residues. Furthermore, Raman markers analyzed
upon a ∼100-fold concentration increase still revealed that
an important population of the random chain persists in cFEE. Nevertheless,
a structural ordering trend has been observed in methanol through
the appearance of type-II′ β-turn UV-CD markers. DFT
calculations confirmed the formation of this reverse type β-turn
in a molecular model embedded in a polarizable continuum mimicking
methanol. It appeared that an intraloop H-bond network might contribute
to maintain the structured loop in a low dielectric constant medium.
It has thus been concluded that the disordered character of cFEE in
water originates presumably from the preponderance of intermolecular
H-bonds between the three hydrophilic residues (Ser2, Glu4, and Glu5) with surrounding water molecules. Beyond
the static QM calculations described in the present analysis, further
molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of explicit water molecules
would be necessary to highlight (i) the loop conformational flexibility
within a sufficiently extended timescale and (ii) the residence time
of water molecules on the loop residues. The latter point would lead
us to a better understanding of the loop structural invariability
either with protonated or with deprotonated Glu residues, probably
caused by the solvent screening of their electrostatic interactions.

Material
and Methods
Sample Preparation
The lyophilized sample of the cyclic
peptide cFEE (Scheme 1, Supplementary Information)
was purchased from Synprosis SA Laboratory (Fuveau, France). Solution
samples were prepared by dissolving the hexapeptide in water taken
from a Millipore filtration system (Merck, Molsheim, France). Stock
solution of the hexapeptide was prepared at 30 mM, that is, ∼21.5
mg/mL. These samples were used in Raman spectroscopic measurements.
Further dilution to lower concentrations was made for other experiments.
Upon dissolution, the pH value of the peptide sample was ∼3;
it was adjusted at higher values by adding NaOH (1 N) to aqueous samples.
Free amino acids (AAs), Ser, Phe, and Glu, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The concentration of their aqueous
samples used for Raman spectroscopy was 50 mM. The pH of Glu samples
was adjusted to render possible the analysis of the side-chain protonation/deprotonation
by Raman markers. Other used chemicals were also provided by Sigma-Aldrich.

Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis (LC-MS/MS)
The hexapeptide was characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry
hyphenated to reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) on a Waters
BEH C18 (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm) column using an ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography system (Waters ACQUITY UPLC; ACQUITY column
manager-type ACQCM 1.40, binary solvent manager-type ACQ-BSM 1.65,
sample manager-type ACQ-SM 1.65; Manchester, U.K.). The mobile phases
were composed of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (mobile phase A) and
0.1% FA in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The LC-MS/MS analysis was
performed using a mobile phase flowrate of 100 μL/min and a
column temperature of 40 °C. Peptide separation was carried out
using a gradient from 5 to 80% B for 38 min followed by 80% B maintained
for 3 min. Then, the column was reconditioned using 5% mobile phase
B during 10 min. A volume of 10 μL, corresponding to 2.5 μg
of cFEE, was injected and analyzed online with an LTQ-Orbitrap XL
mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Manchester, U.K.) hyphenated
through the intermediate of a heated electrospray ionization probe
(HESI-II, Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Data acquisition was controlled
by Xcalibur software (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). ESI source parameters
were set as follows: ESI voltage of −4.0 kV while sheath gas
and auxiliary gas flowrates were set to 40 and 12, respectively. The
source heating temperature was set to 300 °C, capillary temperature
was set to 320 °C, and capillary voltage to a value of 35 V.
The tube lens voltage was set to 90 V. MS/MS was realized in an m/z targeting approach. Fragmentation was
performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID). The parameters
were set to a normalized collision energy of 35%, an activation time
of 30 ms, and an isolation width of 2 Th. The mass/charge (m/z) range was 150–2000 in MS and
100–2000 in MS/MS. Using those parameters, the mean resolution
provided by the instrument was 30,000 in MS (m/z = 715.2062).

Spectroscopic Setups and Post-Record Data
Analysis
Room-temperature UV-CD spectra were analyzed on
a JASCO J-810 spectrophotometer
(Lisses, France) within the 190–300 nm spectral range. A path
length of 1 mm and a spectral resolution of 0.2 nm were selected.
Each spectrum corresponding to an average of five scans was recorded
with a speed of 100 nm/min. To facilitate the comparison of the CD
spectra recorded in different conditions, the measured ellipticity
for each sample, referred to as [ϕ]obs, was further
normalized to obtain the so-called mean residue ellipticity, [ϕ],
by using the expression: , where n, c,
and l are the numbers of residues in the peptide,
the molar concentration, and the optical path length of the sample,
respectively.23 The normalized ellipticity
was expressed in deg cm2 dmol–1.

Room-temperature Stokes Raman spectra were analyzed at the right
angle on a Jobin-Yvon T64000 spectrometer (Longjumeau, France) at
a single spectrograph configuration, with a 1200 grooves/mm holographic
grating and a holographic notch filter. Raman data corresponding to
a 1200 s acquisition time for each spectrum were collected on a liquid
nitrogen-cooled CCD detection system (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon). The
effective slit width was set to 5 cm–1. Solution
samples were excited by the 488 nm line of an Ar+ laser
(Spectra Physics, Evry, France), with 200 mW power at the sample.
Buffer subtraction of the observed spectra was performed using the
GRAMS/AI Z.00 package (Thermo Galactic, Waltham, MA, USA). Final presentation
of Raman spectra was done by means of the SigmaPlot package 6.10 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Quantum Mechanical Calculations
Energetic, geometrical,
and vibrational data of cFEE and its building blocks were estimated
by the density functional theory (DFT) approach,53 using the hybrid B3LYP functional.54,55 Taking into account the structural complexity of the hexapeptide
(86 atomic centers), a cost effective, reasonable size Gaussian-type
atomic basis set, that is, polarized double zeta enriched with d orbital
functions on C, N, and O atoms, referred to as 6-31G(d), was used.
Two starting conformers of cFEE (see Results and
Discussion for details) were placed in a polarizable continuum
model (PCM),56,57 mimicking methanol (εr = 32.63). In contrast, the geometry optimization on free
zwitterionic AAs was performed in a solvent continuum with εr = 78.39 (corresponding to water) by means of a more extended
(triple zeta) basis set additionally equipped with diffuse functions
on all atoms, as well as p orbitals on H atoms, referred to as 6-311++G(d,p).
Geometry optimization was followed by the harmonic vibration calculation.
The absence of any imaginary frequency proved the correspondence of
the optimized conformer to a local minimum in the molecular energy
landscape. The energy order of the optimized geometries of a given
molecular species was determined on the basis of their total energy
(Etot), where Etot = Ee + free energy correction. Each
optimized conformer was identified by its relative energy (ΔE), that is, its energy difference with that corresponding
to the lowest energy one for which ΔE = 0.
All quantum mechanical calculations were made using the Gaussian09
package.58
