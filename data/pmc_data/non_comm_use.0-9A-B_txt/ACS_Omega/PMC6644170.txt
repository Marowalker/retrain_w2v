Herein, we report
the synthesis of the entire acyclic carbon framework
toward (±)-furanocembranoid 1 via the longest linear sequence
of 12 steps from commercially available linalool and diethyl 2-isopropylmalonate.
Key to the success of this synthetic approach is a silver-catalyzed
enyne-annulation reaction for the formation of 2,4-disubstituted furan
motif of unique furanocembranoid 1, isolated from Croton
oblongifolius. Construction of macrocycle has also
been explored using the ring-closing metathesis reaction.

Introduction
Furanocembranoids are
an interesting class of 14-membered macrocycles
embedded with a furan and a 5-membered lactone moiety possessing diverse
biological activities.1 In all of these
natural products, the macrocyclic framework is linked to C2 and C5
positions of the furan ring with C3 substitution. In 2007, a unique
class of novel furanocembranoids 1–3 (Figure 1) was isolated from the stem bark of Croton oblongifolius, which contains the macrocyclic
skeleton connected to C2 and C4 positions of furan without five-membered
lactone.2 Their structures were determined
on the basis of the NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses.
Furanocembranoid 1 (1a) and 3 (1c) displayed
good cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines such as BT474 (human
breast ductol carcinoma), CHAGO (human undifferentiated lung carcinoma),
Hep-G2 (human liver hepatoblastoma), KATO-3 (human gastric carcinoma),
and SW-620 (human colon adrenocarcinoma). The distinctive feature
of 1a, having C2–C4 linked bicyclic furan, provoked
us to explore the synthesis of this molecule. To the best of our knowledge,
the synthesis of furanocembranoid 1 remains unexplored to date.

Alkyne-assisted annulation reactions to deliver furan skeletons
have been regarded as a powerful tool for the synthesis of natural
products.3−5 Recently, we have also successfully explored the
cycloisomerization of enynols for the synthesis of substituted furans.6 On this basis, we considered that cyclodehydration
of enyne-diol7,8 could be a key step in the late-stage
construction of the 2,4-disubstituted furan core of furanocembranoid
1. Scheme 1 outlines
our retrosynthetic analysis of 1a. (±)-Furanocembranoid
1 might be derived by the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction of
furanyl diene 2. This was believed to result from the
addition of alkyne fragment 3 onto protected hydroxy
ketone subunit 4. This alkyne 3 might, in
turn, be accessed from one of the most widely occurring natural products,
(±)-linalool, and ketone 4 was planned to be obtained
from the commercially available diethyl 2-isopropylmalonate.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic
Analysis of Furanocembranoid 1
Results and Discussion
Our synthesis commenced with
the protection of hydroxyl group of
the natural linalool (5) to prepare tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ether 7 (Scheme 2). In the presence of tert-butyldimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TBSOTf)
and 2,6-lutidine, TBS-ether 7 was obtained in 95% yield.
The thus formed 7 was subjected to allylic oxidation
using SeO2 and tert-butylhydrogen peroxide
in CH2Cl2 at room temperature (rt), which provided
a mixture of aldehyde and alcohol. The mixture was reduced using LiAlH4 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 0 °C to afford the allylic
alcohol 8 in 67% yield in two steps. The alcohol 8 was then converted to iodide by treatment with I2 in the presence of triphenylphosphine and imidazole. Subsequent
coupling of iodide with trimethylsilylacetylene in the presence of n-BuLi led to dienyne 9 in 87% yield. Liberation
of the terminal acetylene using K2CO3 in MeOH
then led to the key intermediate 3 in 85% yield.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Alkyne Fragment 3
The synthesis of ketone subunit 4 starting
from the
commercially available diethyl 2-isopropylmalonate (6) is described in Scheme 3. Compound 6 underwent sequential LiAlH4-mediated reduction, followed by selective silylation to generate
monosilylated alcohol 10 in 82% in two steps.9 Oxidation of this material using Dess–Martin
periodinane (DMP) followed by one-carbon Wittig olefination (CH3Ph3P+Br–/tBuOK) afforded terminal alkene 11 in
76% overall yield. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF)-mediated desilylation
of 11 provided the homoallylic alcohol (volatile in nature),
which was subsequently oxidized to aldehyde (volatile aldehyde was
not isolated) using DMP in CH2Cl2, followed
by treatment with β-ketophosphonate 13(10) in the presence of Ba(OH)2·8H2O in THF/H2O to give enone 12 in 65%
yield in three steps. Selective reduction of conjugated olefin using
Stryker’s reagent in toluene offered the desired ketone fragment 4 in 95% yield.11

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of Ketone Subunit 4
After acquiring both the fragments 3 and 4 in gram scale, we proceeded further toward the total synthesis
of
furanocembranoid 1. Thus, the alkynyl lithium anion, generated from
alkyne 3 in the presence of n-BuLi,
was added to ketone 4 to afford the propargylic alcohol 14 in 96% yield. Selective deprotection of primary tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group of 14 using TBAF in THF furnished the diol 15 in 90% yield.
Much to our delight, AgNO3-mediated enyne-assisted cyclization
of the enyne diol 15 in CH2Cl2 at
room temperature provided the desired dienyl-furan E-16a in 90% yield. With substantial amounts of E-16a in hand, we were in a position to test
the crucial ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction.12 Disappointingly, all of the RCM reactions tried on E-16a using different catalysts, Grubb’s
first-generation (G-I) and second-generation (G-II) catalysts and
the Hoveyda–Grubbs catalysts, failed to give the product (starting
material recovered). Herein, we reasoned that the failure of the RCM
reaction might be due to steric hindrance posed by the TBDMS group
of allylic tert-hydroxyl functionality and predicted
that the free tert-hydroxyl group might allow the
RCM reaction. Therefore, furan 16a was transformed to 2 using TBAF in THF at 60 °C. Unfortunately, 2 is also futile to provide the desired product (formation of a nonpolar
unidentified mixture of products observed) under all of the tested
ring-closing metathesis reaction conditions with various catalysts
(see Table S1). Disappointingly, the acetate
precursor E-16b, prepared by acetylation
of 2 by the action of Ac2O in pyridine, did
not provide the corresponding macrocyclic derivative under the same conditions used for 2 (Scheme 4).

Conclusions
In summary, we have achieved the chemical
synthesis of the complete
acyclic carbon framework toward structurally intriguing (±)-furanocembranoid
1 in the longest linear sequence of 12 steps. The synthesis featured
silver-catalyzed enyne-annulation reaction, which enabled rapid construction
of 2,4-disubstituted furan skeleton. An extensive synthetic exploration
directed toward the completion of the total synthesis based on ring-closing
metathesis was ineffective to access the macrocyle, which represents
synthetic challenges for future work. Notably, multigram quantities
of 3, 4, and 16 are readily
prepared through this approach, which is envisioned to serve as the
foundation for the synthesis of furanocembranoid 1.

General Information
Reactions were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica plates using
UV light, anisaldehyde, and β-napthol for visualization. Column
chromatography was performed on silica gel (60–120 mesh) using
petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluents. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solvent on
400 and 500 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts δ and coupling
constants J are given in parts per million (ppm)
and hertz (Hz), respectively. Chemical shifts are reported relative
to residual solvent as an internal standard for 1H and 13C (CDCl3: δ 7.26 ppm for 1H,
and 77.0 ppm). IR spectra were recorded as neat compound. Mass spectra
were recorded on a micromass VG 70–70H or a liquid chromatography/mass
selective detector trap SL spectrometer operating at 70 eV using direct
inlet system. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were recorded
by electrospray ionization (ESI) with a quad time-of-flight mass analyzer.

min. The reaction mixture was diluted with pentane (30 mL), and the
organic layer was washed with three portions of saturated aq sodium
thiosulfate (3 × 15 mL) and then with two 15 mL portions of saturated
aq copper(II) sulfate. The combined organic extracts were dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to afford
