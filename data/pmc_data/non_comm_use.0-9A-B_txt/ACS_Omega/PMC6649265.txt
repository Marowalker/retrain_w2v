Computer simulations
of ion-selective membrane electrodes using
diffusion layer models based on finite-differences principle for calculating
diffusion processes in both phases and taking into account the local
ion exchange equilibrium at the interface are successfully used for
clarifying and even predicting the influence of different diffusion
factors on several time-dependent characteristics of electrodes. It
is shown here that a well-established approach based on the assumption
of the constant concentration of the interfering ion in the sample
solution fails for solutions containing strongly interfering ions
where the concentration of the interfering ion in the boundary layer
of the solution can be far lower in comparison with its concentration
in the bulk. The limitation is demonstrated by a drastic discrepancy
between experimental and calculated curves for the dependence of potential
on time. This limitation can be overcome by taking into account the
change of the interfering ion concentration in the boundary layer
in accordance with the electroneutrality condition. A good agreement
between simulation results and experimental data is demonstrated.

Introduction
Ion-selective electrodes
or ISEs (the term “ion-selective”
reflects their capability to discriminate between the primary and
interfering ions) are potentiometric chemical sensors comprising widely
used tools for sensing ions in solutions, and having important practical
significance for laboratory research and clinical, environmental,
and industrial analysis.1,2 The obvious advantages
of ISEs are low cost of equipment, simplicity of pretreatment (normally
no pretreatment is required), operability in turbid and colored media,
possibilities of in line and in vivo measurements, nondestructive
analysis, continuous monitoring, and so forth. Unlike other analytical
techniques, measurements with ISEs provide with data on the activity
of the analyte, and in many cases, this is a critical advantage. ISEs
are normally classified by the material of the ion-exchange membrane
and are divided into glass, crystalline, and liquid membrane (including
plasticized polymeric membrane) ones. The last class comprises the
most numerous group of ISEs; in this case, the ion-exchange ability
of the membrane is achieved by the introduction into the membrane
liquid ion exchangers, for example, tetraphenyl borate derivatives
as cation exchangers or higher quaternary ammonium salts as anion
exchangers. For a long time, it was believed that the response of
such electrodes is thermodynamically determined and depends on the
Gibbs energy of the process of transfer of the corresponding ion from
the solution to the membrane phase, but now it is well known that
diffusion processes occurring at the membrane/sample solution interface
and inside the membrane can have a significant impact on the ISE response,
leading, in some cases, to the drastic change of the selectivity,
sensitivity, and lower detection limit.3−7 Under conditions of diffusion control of the potential, the indicated
ISE characteristics strongly depend on the specific experimental conditions,
including parameters that are easily adjustable (rate of the solution
stirring, concentration) and are usually time dependent. It should
be noted that such effects are well known since the 1980s and are
discussed in detail in the works of Hulanicki and Lewenstam on the
example of solid-state membrane electrodes.8,9 In
particular, it was shown that if an interfering ion forms a less soluble
precipitate, compared to the primary one, its concentration in the
near-electrode layer of the solution decreases as compared to the
bulk one as a result of reprecipitation. In this case, a concentration
gradient arises and the delivery of the interfering ion from the bulk
solution to the electrode surface is controlled by the diffusion process.
Thus, the experimentally determined selectivity coefficients depend
both on the concentration of the interfering ion in the bulk solution
and on time. Subsequently, it was shown that diffusion processes also
affect the response of ISE with liquid membranes10 (in this case, it is necessary to take into account diffusion
processes in both phases), and the detected effects have found important
practical applications for kinetic discrimination of strongly interfering
ions by reducing the readout time.11,12

Because
of the considerable difficulties in the experimental study
of diffusion processes inside the membrane, on the one hand, and fast
progress in the numerical simulation methods, on the other hand, various
time-dependent diffusion models of electrode potential have recently
been developed. These models have a certain prognostic ability and,
in some cases, allow us to evaluate the influence of various factors
on the functioning of ISE much faster and cheaper than experimentally.

One of the most frequently used is the dynamic diffusion model
proposed by Morf,13 based on the use of
the finite-difference method and proved to be effective in a number
of practical applications.14−19 According to this model, the membrane phase and the diffusion layer
of the solution are divided into a certain number of conditional layers
that are thin enough so that the concentration profiles within each
layer can be considered linear, which allows replacing the differentials
in the Fick equations describing the diffusion processes inside each
of the phases by the ratios of small, but finite values and significantly
simplify the calculation algorithm. Therefore, the concentration of
any component in any conditional layer in the membrane or in the diffusion
layer of the solution, with the exception of boundary layers, at an
arbitrary time instant t + Δt is easily calculated on the bases of its concentrations in this
and two adjacent layers at the previous time instant t, and assuming linear diffusion. The equations used for the calculations
in the boundary (surface) layers in the case of the ion-exchange membranes
can be written as follows 1   2  where symbols with and
without a macron refer
to the phase of the membrane and to the aqueous phase, correspondingly;
δ is the thickness of the conditional layer; CA,0 and CA,1 are the concentrations
of the primary ion in the surface (zero) and the first conditional
layers; CB is the interfering ion concentration
in the solution;  is
the total ion exchanger concentration
in the membrane; and KAB is the ion exchange constant which is
equal to the unbiased selectivity coefficient.

Good prognostic
ability of this model has been demonstrated in
a number of works.14−19 However, it was recently found that the model shows principal limitations
that in some realistic scenarios of the electrode operation may lead
to the oscillation of the calculated values of potential and even
to failure of the calculations.17,19−21 Bakker drew attention to the fact that eq 1 is valid only if the concentration of ion
A in the zero layer of the membrane is constant. Because, under the
nonsteady state conditions this assumption is not fulfilled, an additional
term taking into account the change in the concentration of the ion
A must be introduced into eq 1.21 Then eq 1 takes the form 3  

Further, solving
the system of eqs 2 and 3, we can obtain an analytical
solution for calculating the concentrations of the primary ion in
the surface layer of the solution.

Results and Discussion
We found that Morf’s model contains one more pitfall, namely,
use of the eq 2 is based
on the assumption that the concentration of the interfering ion B
in the near-electrode layer of water is equal to its concentration
in the bulk and does not change with time. This assumption is quite
acceptable in the case of the operation of ISEs in the presence of
highly discriminated interfering ions when the ion-exchange equilibrium
is strongly shifted to the left. However, in the case of strongly
interfering ions, this assumption is not fulfilled because of the
intensive ion-exchange process at the interface. As a result, a drastic
discrepancy between the experimental and calculated electrode response
is observed (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Dependencies of the potential vs time for nitrate SE at different
concentrations of picrate in the sample solution (indicated on the
legend). The concentration of nitrate in all solutions was 10–3 M. Simulation parameters: KAB = 3.8 × 105; Dm = 9 × 10–12 m2/s; Daq = 1.6 × 10–9 m2/s; laq =
25 μm; and lm = 400 μm. Dots
in circles represent the potential calculated using the Nikolskii
equation.

On this figure, the experimental
curves of the dynamics of the
potential change for a nitrate-selective electrode in solutions containing
different concentrations of picrate (a highly interfering ion) are
compared with the corresponding potential on time dependences calculated
according to Morf’s model improved by Bakker. The choice of
picrate ions as the interfering one is due, on the one hand, to the
very high lipophilicity of picrate, which ensures their strong interfering
effect, and on the other hand, by the guaranteed absence of picrate
in salts of the primary ion, nitrate, which is necessary for the purity
of the experiment. One can see that calculated potential values are
independent of time and correspond to those calculated from the Nikolskii
equation. On the contrary, the experimental potential values are time-dependent
and the potential drop caused by the injection of picrate is much
less than that predicted according to the Nikolskii equation.

The observed discrepancies can be explained by the fact that the
concentration of picrate in the near-electrode layer of the solution,
responsible for the change of potential, is far smaller than the concentration
in the bulk solution (due to the intensive ion-exchange process at
the interface) and is time dependent. So the eq 2 should be modified as follows 4  where CB,0(t + Δt) is the concentration of the
interfering ion in the near-electrode (zero) layer of the solution.
It depends on time that can be accounted according to the following
considerations. Assuming that the ion exchange is the only way of
the mass transfer of ions A and B across the interface while the co-extraction
processes can be neglected, the concentration of the co-ion X in all
layers of the sample solution should be equal to its bulk concentration
and should not depend on time 5  where X is the oppositely charged
co-ion.

Further, assuming the local electroneutrality condition
in the
zero layer (as well as in any other layer) is fulfilled for any instant
of time, the following equation is valid 6  

Thus, the expression for CB,0(t + Δt) can be written as follows 7  

The explicit form of the formula for calculating
the concentration
of the primary ion in the near-electrode layer can be obtained by
solving the system of eqs 3, 4, and 7 8  where 9   10   11  

The above
formula was obtained for the case when the thicknesses
of the surface (zero) layers in the membrane and in the aqueous diffusion
layer are equal to each other. If the thicknesses of these layers
in the membrane and in the aqueous diffusion layer are different,
a somewhat more complicated formula can be obtained.

Besides,
if the concentration of the interfering ion in the sample
solution is rather small, as it is in the case under consideration,
the change of the concentration in the bulk solution (CB) due to the uptake by the membrane should be taken into
account as well 12  where VS is the
sample solution volume; Vlast is the volume
of the last elementary layer of the aqueous diffusion layer; and CB,last is the interfering ion concentration
in this layer.

Data presented on Figure 2 illustrate a drastic (up to 5 decimal orders)
drop of the
concentration of picrate in the near-electrode layer of the sample
solution versus its concentration in the bulk. One can see as well
that the most pronounced drop of the concentration is observed for
the initial times of measurements, while with the increase of time,
the picrate concentration in the near-electrode layer of the solution
rises. These observations are in full accordance with the experimental
results presented on Figure 1. Also finally, one can see that the decrease of picrate concentration
in the bulk solution due to its extraction into the membrane should
be also taken into account if the measuring time is not too short
(the change of the bulk concentration of picrate for 20 min exposition
of the electrode in the solution is about 30%).

concentrations in the aqueous diffusion
layer calculated for the nitrate-SE operation in a mixed solution
of nitrate (10–3 M) and picrate (10–6 M). Simulation parameters are indicated in the caption to Figure 1.

Data presented on Figure 3 illustrate the predictive ability of the
Morf’s–Bakker’s
model modified by us for the case of the ISE operation in the presence
of small concentrations of strongly interfering ions. The calculation
results obtained using eqs 3, 4, 7, and 12 agree well with experimental data and reflect both
far less influence of the interfering ion on the electrode potential
than it could be expected from the unbiased selectivity coefficient
and the potential dependence on time. Therefore, the distinctive feature
of the described model is that, unlike the model proposed by Morf
and later improved by Bakker, it takes into account that the concentration
of the interfering ions in the near-membrane layer of the solution
differs from that in the solution bulk. It should be mentioned here
that this idea was expressed earlier by Lewenstam and Hulanicki who
proposed to introduce a time-dependent parameter s(t) called the “surface coverage”
or “site filling factor”.8 This parameter was defined as the share of the sites in the surface
layer of the membrane occupied by the interfering ions which directly
depends on the concentrations of both primary and interfering ions
in the surface layer of the solution.8 It
was shown that the use of this parameter allows one to describe the
dependence of the potential on time, including the cases where the
primary and interfering ions have different diffusion coefficients
in both water and the membrane. However, the explicit form of the
equation for calculating this parameter was not proposed at that time,
so its use for practical calculations is rather complicated.22 The model described by us in this paper does
not include the site filling factor s(t) as a modeling parameter. Furthermore, it allows for the calculation
of this value, inserting of which into the eq 12 in ref (23) allows us to obtain the
same EMF versus time dependence as in the framework of the model described
in this paper (see the Supporting Information I for more details).

Figure 3 Simulation results in the framework of the Morf’s–Bakker’s
model modified by us and the IET model at low concentrations of picrate
in the sample solution (indicated on legend). Simulation parameters
are indicated in the caption to Figure 1.

It should be mentioned
here that absolutely the same results using
the same modeling parameters can be directly obtained in the framework
of the recently proposed interface equilibria-triggered model (IET
model) that is based on the separate, step-by-step account of the
local equilibrium at the interface and diffusion in the membrane and
solution phases.20 Namely, each new calculation
cycle begins with recalculating the concentrations of components in
sufficiently thin surface layers of the membrane and solution, based
on the concentrations of these components established at a previous
time point as a result of diffusion, so that the corrected values
(denoted with an asterisk) satisfy the local equilibrium condition 13  

Using the conditions
of electroneutrality and material balance,
this equation is converted to the form 14  where CA, and CB are the
concentrations of components A and
B at the previous time point, ΔCA is the difference between the corrected and the initial value of
the concentration of ion A, δ is the thickness of the surface
layer, and the horizontal upper bar denotes the membrane phase.

Equation 14 can be
solved explicitly with respect to ΔCA. Next, the corrected values of the concentrations of components
A and B in the surface layers of both phases are calculated, and these
values are further used to describe the diffusion processes in each
phase in accordance with the difference form of the Fick equations
(see the Supporting Information II for more
details). Thus, while in the model considered in this work, the concentration
of potential-determining ions in the surface layers of the solution
and the membrane is calculated with the joint solution of three eqs 3, 4, and 7, in the IET model, a phased account
of ion exchange and diffusion processes is carried out. However, both
models lead to identical results, which are in good agreement with
the experimental data.

Figure 3 also shows
that for sufficiently long measurement times, the curve calculated
under the assumption of a constant concentration of the interfering
ion in the bulk solution significantly deviates from the experimental
data, so it is necessary to take into account not only the changes
in the concentration of the interfering ion in the near-electrode
layer, but also the changes in the bulk solution because of the interfering
ion uptake by the membrane.

Figure 4 shows the
dependencies of the potential on time for the nitrate-SE in mixed
picrate and nitrate solutions for higher concentrations of picrate,
which confirms the high prognostic ability of the modified model in
all real-life scenarios of ISE operation. The model predicts a very
strong dependence of the potential on time and its sharp drop to the
value predicted with the Nikolskii equation. The simulation results
are in quite good agreement with the experimental data.

Figure 4 Dependencies
of the potential vs time for nitrate-SE at high concentrations
of picrate in the sample solution (indicated on the legend). The concentration
of nitrate in both cases was 10–3 M. Simulation
parameters are indicated in the caption to Figure 1. Dashed lines represent the potential calculated
using the Nikolskii equation.

Conclusions
It is shown that the dynamic diffusion potential
model proposed
by Morf and improved by Bakker is not applicable in its current form
to predict the functioning of ISEs in the presence of small concentrations
of strongly interfering ions. The modification of this model, which
consists in taking into account the concentration change of the interfering
ion in the near-electrode layer of the solution, as well as the concentration
change in the bulk solution, allows one to obtain an adequate description
of the experimental results. This case, considering measuring in the
presence of small concentrations of strongly interfering ions, seems
to be quite realistic in some practical applications of ISEs. Therefore,
the obtained results may be of practical interest for assessing the
possibilities of performing measurements under certain experimental
conditions, as well as for a priori search for ways to reduce the
influence of the interfering ion by a targeted change in conditions
affecting the intensity of diffusion that are amenable to regulation.

Experimental
Details
The object of the study was an ion exchanger-based
nitrate-selective
electrode; the picrate ion was used as the interfering one. The choice
was made for the reason of high lipophilicity of picrate ions and
their guaranteed absence in nitrate salts, thus ensuring the purity
of the experiment. ISE membranes were prepared using polyvinyl chloride
as a binding polymer (20 wt %), o-nitrophenyl octyl
ether as a plasticizer (79.4 wt %), and tridodecylmethylammonium chloride
as an ion exchanger (0.6 wt % or approximately 0.01 M). The unbiased
selectivity coefficient  was determined by the
modified separate
solution method.24 The study of the influence
of the interfering ion on the ISE response was carried out in the
following way. First, the electrodes were immersed into the initial
solution of the primary ion (20 mL) for 15–20 min to achieve
stable value of the potential (the potential drift did not exceed
0.2 mV/min). After that, a certain volume (2.2 mL) of the previously
prepared mixed solution containing an appropriate concentration of
the interfering ion and the background of the primary ion corresponding
to its concentration in the initial solution was added, preventing
the interruption of the contact of the membrane with the solution,
and the dynamics of the potential change was recorded. All the measurements
were carried out at room temperature 19 ± 1 °C.

Simulation Details
The following parameters were used in the simulation: the membrane
thickness was 400 μm; the thicknesses of elementary layers in
the both phases were 5 μm; and the time increment was 5 ms.
The area of the membrane was 1 cm2. Because in all experiments
the main electrolyte in the sample solution was potassium nitrate,
the diffusion coefficient of the ions in the solution was assumed
to be equal to the arithmetic mean of the diffusion coefficients of
potassium and nitrate ions (1.6 × 10–9 m2/s).25 The diffusion coefficient
of ions in the membrane phase for a membrane containing 20 wt % of
PVC was chosen equal to 9 × 10–12 m2/s. The thickness of the water diffusion layers (25 μm) was
selected on the basis of experimental value of this parameter for
a stirring rate of 500 rpm.26 The values
of the potential were calculated according to the equation 15  where const was chosen equal to the value
at which the calculated ISE potential in the initial solution of the
primary ion coincided with the experimental value (see the Supporting Information III,IV for the program code).
