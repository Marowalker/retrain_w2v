CuxAu(1–x) bimetallic ultrathin-film catalysts
for nitrate electroreduction
have been synthesized using electrochemical atomic layer deposition
by surface-limited redox replacement of Pb underpotentially deposited
layer. Controlled by the ratio of [Cu2+] ions and [AuCl4–] complex in the deposition solution, the
alloy film composition (atomic fraction, x in the
range of 0.5–1) has been determined by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and indirectly estimated by anodic stripping voltammetry.
The catalytic activity and durability of CuxAu(1–x) thin films, Cu thin film,
and bulk Cu have been studied by one- and multiple-cycle voltammetry.
The synthesized CuxAu(1–x) thin films feature up to two times higher nitrate
electroreduction activity in acidic solution compared to bulk and
thin-film Cu counterparts. Highest activity has been measured with
a Cu0.70Au0.30 catalyst. Durability tests have
demonstrated that Cu thin films undergo rapid deactivation losing
65% of its peak activity for 92 cycles, whereas Cu0.70Au0.30 catalysts lose only 45% of their top performance. The
significantly better durability of alloy films can be attributed to
effective resistance to poisoning and/or hindered dissolution of Cu
active centers. It has been also found that both CuxAu(1–x) and pure Cu thin
films show best electroreduction activity at lowest pH.

1 Introduction
In the last few decades,
nitrate pollution has gradually become
a severe environmental problem.1 The undesired
contamination with nitrates is largely due to the byproduct of fertilizers
and nuclear and animal waste.2 A high concentration
of NO3– ions in drinking water poses
a health hazard to human beings. It has been proven that these hazards
could result in methaemoglobinaemia (blue-baby syndrome) or even potentially
cancer.3,4 The global trend for environmental compatibility
has led to increasing demand for removing nitrates using environmental
friendly approaches that meet energy conservation standards.5 There are a couple of methods that have been
developed to collect or eliminate NO3– ions from aqueous media. Some of these include physicochemical means,6,7 biological denitrification,8 and electrochemical
reduction approaches.9−11 Among all, reverse osmosis and ion exchange are two
major commercial ways to remove nitrate from drinking water.12 However, the need for post-treatment sludge
generation and high membrane costs associated with said approaches
significantly restricts the expansion of their application.5 Because of the controllable selectivity, environmental
compatibility, and relatively low cost, the electroreduction of nitrate
through a metallic or bimetallic catalyst has been considered the
most promising technique for denitrification.13,14 An additional advantage of this approach is that with application
of different reduction routes along with their elimination/removal,
the NO3– ions could be converted into
a variety of useful chemicals, such as ammonia and hydroxylamine.

Electroreduction of nitrate in acidic solution has been investigated
by many researchers. Dima et al.15 have
reported comprehensively on the nitrate electroreduction activity
of coinage metals and transition metals in acidic solution. It is
concluded that Cu known to produce ammonia as the main reduction product
is the most active catalyst among coinage metals.15 Studies detailing the mechanism of nitrate electroreduction
on poly- and single-crystalline Cu electrodes have also been found
in the literature.16−18 Overall, an eight-electron reduction route with a
standard reduction potential E0 = 0.80
V versus H+/H2 (normal hydrogen electrode, NHE)
as presented below is believed to be the dominating nitrate electroreduction
process on Cu 1  In more detail, the mechanistic study identifies
the above reduction process as a multiple-step process.15 As a result of different steps of this process,
a variety of intermediates such as NO and NO2– have been reported.15 The research on
single-crystal faces of Cu with different orientations also suggested
slight differences in the reduction mechanism and catalytic performance.19 Overall, the main drawbacks reported for using
Cu as catalyst for nitrate electroreduction are associated with its
oxidative dissolution20 and surface poisoning/passivation
leading to catalyst loss and deactivation, respectively.15,18 According to proposed reasons for catalyst deactivation, the spontaneous
oxidization of Cu17 and competitive adsorption
of ions other than NO3– (mostly H+ 15−17,21,22) are deemed key factors in the performance deterioration of the
monometallic Cu. To address these drawbacks, many research groups
synthesized bimetallic catalysts to boost the catalyst’s activity
and enhance its durability. Vorlop and Tacke23 first synthesized bimetallic catalysts consisting of both noble
metal and promoter metal. The mechanism and performance of bimetallic
catalysts like Pt–Cu and Pd–Cu have been studied by
many groups.24−29 According to these studies, the main function of the noble metal
is to stabilize the promoter metal, steer overall catalytic selectivity,
and provide sites for H adsorption.25 The
general mechanism for nitrate electroreduction at a bimetallic catalyst
in an acidic environment is summarized in the following reactions30−32 2   3   4  This mechanism indicates
that H+ ions tend to discharge and adsorb preferentially
on the noble-metal
surface. The adsorbed H atoms then engage more in facilitating the
nitrate reduction rather than poisoning the promoter metal. Generally,
it is believed that the adsorbed H atoms could transfer to the O moieties
of NO3– ions at the catalyst surface
to form OH–, thus facilitating the entire reduction
process.22 Although impact on catalysts’
activity of anions other than NO3– has
also been reported,17 most of the mechanistic
studies suggest that optimal catalysts for nitrate electroreduction
are bimetallic structures consisting of two different types of active
sites: promoter metal sites responsible for the NO3– adsorption followed by reduction and noble-metal sites
providing for H adsorption, promoter stabilization, and product control.

Several synthetic methods for mono- or bimetalic catalysts have
been reported in the literature. Some groups employ electrodeposition
methods,33−35 which leads to burying of a large amount of noble
metal under the active surface. Other groups synthesize nanoparticulate
mono- or bimetallic catalysts.36,37 Most tests of these
catalysts focus on the impact of intermetal interactions on the nitrate
electroreduction activity.38 The results
suggest that the activity could be enhanced by improving the mixing
homogeneity between noble and promoter metals.38 However, the nanoparticle preparation method is often time-consuming
and complex, which generally limits its application. In this context,
electrochemical atomic layer deposition (E-ALD) of ultrathin bimetallic
films appears to be the optimal method because of its ability to maximize
the utilization of noble metal under strict deposition control in
realization continuous films as thin as a few monolayers (MLs).39 The E-ALD utilizing a surface-limited redox
replacement (SLRR) reaction has also been proven to provide the best
homogeneity among all electrochemical deposition approaches.39,40

As recently summarized in a review article, our group has
developed
a one-cell approach for realizing the E-ALD by SLRR protocol and thus
making it convenient for synthesis of low-Pt-loading catalysts.39,41,42 Using that approach and replacing
underpotentially deposited (UPD) Pb, Cu, and H layers, we successfully
synthesized Pd,43 Pt,42,44,45 and Pt–Cu ultrathin films on flat
and nanoporous gold surfaces.46,47 The main objective
of this work is to investigate the functionality of gold as noble-metal
constituent in bimetallic catalyst for nitrate electroreduction. The
emphasis is on the evaluation of gold’s ability to (i) stabilize
copper, (ii) minimize copper poisoning, and (iii) facilitate the nitrate
reduction reaction. In this work, CuxAu(1–x) thin-film catalysts were synthesized
via the SLRR-based method, and chronopotentiometry was used to monitor
the growth process. After the deposition, Pb UPD cyclic voltammetry
(CV) was used to assess the surface roughness of as-grown catalysts.
Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) were employed to confirm the atomic ratio (elemental content)
of the prepared catalyst. The activity and durability of Cu–Au
catalysts are tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry.
The catalytic behavior of Cu–Au films with different compositions
is also discussed in this paper. To contemplate the influence of free
H+ ion concentration, the pH was varied from 1.62 to 5.50
in the testing of Cu–Au bimetallic and plain Cu catalysts.
The behavior of bulk copper and Cu–Au in different pH solutions
was also studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Cu–Au and Cu Ultrathin-Film Synthesis
through SLRR on Au Substrate
Polycrystalline Au electrodes
were used as a substrate for CuxAu(1–x) and Cu ultrathin-film deposition.
Pb UPD CV known to produce signature type curves for different crystallographic
orientations of Au was employed to characterize the surface of the
Au substrate before each experiment as both the ultrathin-film growth
and nitrate reduction have shown dependence on the substrate crystallographic
orientation.19Figure 1 shows a representative Pb UPD curve on Au
(poly) electrodes used as a substrate in this study. Reference to
such curves for comparison could be found in other papers of our group
as well.43,48 The distinct presence of a sharp and narrow
split cathodic peak at 0.2 V versus Pb/Pb2+ suggests a
dominating (111) orientation of the Au polycrystalline electrodes.
There are some additional contributions of (100) and (110) shown by
other peaks. The overall shape of the CV curve in terms of width and
height of the peaks ascertains the suitability of the Au electrodes
as substrates for Cu–Au and Cu deposition.

Figure 1 Pb UPD CV curve in a
solution containing 100 mM NaClO4, 10 mM HClO4, and 3 mM Pb(ClO4)2 on a polycrystalline Au
substrate before SLRR Au–Cu alloy
co-deposition. The sweep rate is 20 mV s–1.

The growth of Cu and Cu–Au
bimetallic ultrathin films was
conducted by an SLRR approach employing Pb UPD as a sacrificial layer
and realized in one-cell configuration.44,49 Thereby, for
the Cu film, Cu2+ ions replace spontaneously the predeposited
Pb UPD layer, whereas for the Cu–Au ultrathin film, the replacement
will be powered by both Cu2+ ions and [AuCl4]− complex. To avoid further displacement of Cu
by [AuCl4]− in the course of alloy film
deposition, it is essential to strictly control the cut-off potential
(C-OP). Figure 2 shows
a representative potential transient for a set of 15 “building
block” SLRR cycles performed on Au (poly) electrodes to deposit
a Cu–Au ultrathin film. The growth procedure is initiated from
the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the substrate, followed by the
application of a negative pulse to a potential of −0.850 V
(−0.05 V vs Pb/Pb2+) for 1 s. Because of the substantial
concentration difference of Cu2+, AuCl4– complex, and Pb2+ ions, only negligible
amounts of Cu and Au are deposited in that 1 s of PbUPD layer formation.39 Then, after the release
of the potential control, the Cu2+ ions and AuCl4– replace the Pb atoms causing a potential excursion
back to OCP. The film thickness could be controlled by the number
of administered SLRR events. In Figure 2, the OCP transients depict a replacement rate that
slows down from the first to the third SLRR cycle because of the substrate
change (from Au to Cu) and then gradually levels off with an increase
of the Cu–Au film thickness, suggesting a dominant activation
control for the exchange reaction.44,49

Figure 2 Potential transient
depicting the growth of Cu–Au on Au
(poly) using 15 SLRR cycles of Pb UPD. The solution composition is
0.5 mM Cu(ClO4)2, 0.5 mM NaAuCl4,
1 mM Pb(ClO4)2, 10 mM HClO4, and
100 mM NaClO4.

When it comes to the SLRR co-deposition of Cu–Au bimetallic
ultrathin film, it is very important to determine the cut-off potential
(C-OP) where the next PbUPD layer formation needs to be
applied after the completion of the previous SLRR cycle. The C-OP
in the case of Au–Cu deposition must be negative to the OCP
so that any potential displacement of already deposited Cu atoms by
AuCl4– species be strictly eliminated.
A similar strategy was employed in another work of our group whereby
PtxCu1–x alloy thin films were deposited by SLRR in one-cell setup.47 In the general case scenario when an alloy of
Cu with more-noble metal (Pt, Au) is deposited, the cut-off potential
depends on the relative concentrations of Cu2+ ions and
the more-noble-metal complexes (like [AuCl4]−) in the solution. More specifically, the cut-off potential at Cu/Au
solution ratios of 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1 in the present work is set at
−0.45, −0.41, and −0.35 V, respectively. Figure 3 shows the replacement
process at the [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] solution ratio 1:1. The low-sloped part of the curve between −0.4
and −0.2 V where likely most of the redox replacement process
takes place, one can clearly see regions with two different slopes.
The first range of the curve featuring steeper slope is most likely
associated with the replacement of Pb by both Cu2+ and
AuCl4–. The following second range features
slower potential change, likely associated with a process with impeded
kinetics. Most likely, that process could be the one mentioned, where
the replacement of already deposited Cu atoms by [AuCl4]− complex species occurs. Should the later process
be enabled the resultant deposit will be substantially richer in Au
in comparison with the targeted Au/Cu atomic fraction ratio in the
deposited alloy. Hence, the C-OP must be chosen negatively to the
potential indicated by the arrow in Figure 3.

process after

composition is 0.5 mM Cu(ClO4)2, 0.5 mM NaAuCl4, 1 mM Pb(ClO4)2, 10 mM HClO4, and 100 mM NaClO4.

2.2 Anodic Stripping of SLRR-Deposited CuxAu(1–x) Ultrathin
Film
The overall amount of deposited metals in the prepared
plain Cu and Cu–Au bimetallic thin films could be obtained
by ASV. Although the stripping involves only Cu, the analysis of the
stripping experiment taking into account also the overall deposition
charge allows for quantitative analysis of the amount of deposited
Cu and Au from different solutions with molar ratio of [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] = 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Figure 4 shows a plot of
stripping curves obtained by ASV for ultrathin Cu–Au at different
atomic compositions. On the basis of the Cu–Au phase diagram,50,51 it is intended that at room temperature, all intended compositions
would eventually form mixtures of three thermodynamically stable phases
that could coexist, namely, Cu3Au, CuAu, and CuAu3. Apparently, owing to the drastically different Au contents, these
phases undoubtedly dealloy at different critical potentials as seen
in earlier work of our group where Cu and Au were co-electrodeposited.46 Similarly with Cu–Au bulk alloy52 and Cu–Au thin film,46 the stripping curve of CuxAu(1–x) ultrathin film synthesized in
this work exhibits multistage dealloying. In Figure 4, the dealloying curves of different alloy
compositions feature a peak in the potential range 0.18–0.35
V versus Cu/Cu2+ pseudoreference electrode (PRE), which
corresponds to the nonbonded or low coordination Cu on the surface
site. The stripping critical potential for nonbonded Cu appears far
more positive than that of single Cu metal, featuring a positive excursion
of 0.2 V. The second peak is seen in the range 0.60–0.75 V.
It is believed that this peak is associated with the dissolution of
Cu3Au based on previous results in determining the critical
potential of Cu3Au bulk alloy.52 The third peak, which appears in the range 0.80–1.00 V, is
associated with the stripping of CuAu and CuAu3. Each of
the alloy ultrathin films has different contents of single-phase Cu–Au
alloys based on the relative concentrations of Cu and Au. Consequently,
alloys enriched in Cu, like those deposited at [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] solution ratio of 4:1, would feature
more Cu3Au, which is related to the second peak in the
range 0.60–0.75 V. The alloys with more Au, such as Cu/Au =
2:1, contain more CuAu and CuAu3 phases, which will show
up in the third peak (0.80–1.00 V).

of Cu–Au ultrathin films in 1 mM
CuSO4 and 100 mM HClO4 with different compositions
electrodeposited in solutions with [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] ratios: red 4:1, blue 2:1, and green 1:1. Sweep
rate is 1 mV s–1.

Further analysis of the ASV curves (Figure 4) can enable an estimate of the overall Cu
content in the SLRR co-deposited Au–Cu alloys, which in turn
can be used to further understand the relationship between [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] solution ratio and
the composition of the accordingly deposited alloy. Table 1 summarizes the total dealloying
charge as well as the dealloying charges in different potential ranges
determined by ASV for Cu–Au ultrathin film with different compositions.
All reported charges have been corrected with the background charge
measured under identical conditions on pure Au electrode. A closer
look at the data in Table 1 suggests that with the increase of Cu atomic fraction in
the deposited alloy, more of the nonbonded or low coordination alloyed
Cu atoms will take part in the dissolution process, resulting in most
of the Cu being dissolved at most negative potential range. Compared
with our previous results on the dealloying of Cu–Au thin films
synthesized by bulk co-deposition,46 the
use of SLRR co-deposition in this work suggests the presence of more
alloyed Cu, which on dealloying (Figure 4 and Table 1) results in more charge in the second and third anodic
potential ranges. This phenomenon is possibly due to enhanced homogeneity
in the Cu–Au alloy layer deposited by SLRR through layer-by-layer
deposition. A more detailed consideration and further analysis of
data presented in Table 1 along with accounting for the number of administered SLRR cycles
and the charge density of one ML of Pb, which is same on both Cu and
Au polycrystalline electrodes,53 could
be used to estimate quantitatively the atomic fraction of Cu/Au ratio
in the SLRR-deposited alloys. More specifically, such an estimate
could be done knowing that 15 SLRR cycles will produce on a one-at-a-time
basis, a total of 15 MLs of PbUPD with a total charge of
4500 μC cm–2 (300 μC cm–2 for 1 ML Pb on Aupoly).48,54 Then, Pb will
further be replaced at OCP by Cu2+ and AuCl4– at an assumed efficiency of 94% as suggested
by earlier experience with the growth of pure Cu by SLRR.55 This means that the total deposition charge
for the growth of our alloy films in the 15-cycle run will be 4230
μC cm–2. For [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] = 1:1, one measures a total Cu stripping charge
of 1994 μC cm–2 (see Table 1) that is then corrected with the background
charge (620 μC cm–2). As a result of this
correction presented in the first row of the respective cell in Table 1, one obtains a net
Cu stripping charge of 1374 μC cm–2 (see the
second row of the cell). Finally, assuming that the difference between
the corrected total deposition charge (4230 μC cm–2) and Cu stripping charge (1374 μC cm–2)
is associated with Au fraction in the alloy and taking into account
the difference in the oxidation state between Cu and Au in the solution
(2:3, respectively), one calculates the atomic fraction ratio Cu/Au
in the analyzed alloy to be 1:1.4. More results summarizing the corrected
total stripping charge and partial charges in different potential
ranges for Cu–Au alloys deposited from solutions with 2:1 and
4:1 Cu2+/[AuCl4]− ratio can
be also found in Table 1. On the basis of the respective data and the above described algorithm,
the table presents calculated Cu/Au atomic fraction ratios in the
respective alloys as well.

2.3 Atomic Composition Assessment by XPS
The atomic composition
of synthesized Cu–Au ultrathin film
could be determined by XPS. The XPS characterization results for Cu–Au
alloys deposited in solutions with different ratios of [Cu2+] and [AuCl4]− by 40 SLRR cycles are
presented in Figure 5. Specifically, for concentration ratios of [Cu2+]/[AuCl4] equal to 3:1, 1:1, and 1:2, the analysis of the XPS results
yielded Cu/Au atomic composition ratios of 70:30 (2.3:1), 45:55 (1:1.2),
and 30:70 (1:2.3), respectively. The Cu and Au contents in the alloy
were determined with an error of inhomogeneous distribution of metals
on the surface and inaccurate relative sensitivity factors due to
the oxidization of metals on the surface, respectively. Compared with
the electrochemical dealloying results, the charges were determined
with an error of about 5% and the XPS results are more accurate with
a percentage error of up to 1.00%. As seen in Table 2, the obtained results by both methods are
reasonably close (compare directly alloys deposited in solution with
1:1 [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] ratio),
and both suggest the presence of a higher atomic fraction of Au in
comparison with the one that follows directly from the Cu/Au solution
ratio. This finding persists as a trend in all other alloy compositions
subjected to both characterization approaches even though direct comparison
cannot be made because of differences in the Cu/Au solution ratios.
Therefore, it can be concluded that Cu atomic fraction in the alloy
is always lower than the one following from the specific solution
composition. The observed common trend in measured and estimated atomic
fractions could be explained by the strong likelihood of secondary
galvanic displacement of already deposited Cu atoms by the substantially
more noble Au ones. Such secondary displacement is readily enabled
by the presence of AuCl4– complex at
potentials that are only slightly positive so that the cut-off potential
is chosen inevitably with considerable ambiguity. Overall, regardless
of the encountered discrepancy between the solution and atomic fraction
ratios of Cu/Au, the analyses of ASV and XPS results indicate that
the atomic composition is generally controllable by tuning the [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] ratio in the growth
solution.

compositions electrodeposited in solution with the following [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] ratios: (A) 3:1,
(B) 1:1, and (C) 1:2.

2.4 Nitrate Electroreduction Activity Tests
In this work, bulk Cu, bulk Au, Cu ultrathin film, and Cu0.53Au0.47 ultrathin alloy film deposited in a solution with
Cu/Au ratio of 2:1, both produced by 15 SLRR cycles, have been chosen
for assessment of catalytic activity in nitrate electroreduction test
in 10 mM HClO4 solutions with and without 10 mM HNO3. Figure 6 shows
the nitrate electroreduction activity of selected catalysts. The violet
and the green curves indicate that ultrathin-film Cu shows similar
reduction activity as the bulk copper catalyst. Thus, the cathodic
current exhibits the first peak at −0.75 V versus mercury–mercurous
sulfate electrode (MSE) ascribed elsewhere to the reduction of NO3– to NO2– for
bulk copper and copper ultrathin film.16−18 Going negatively on
the CV curve, one sees another peak at −1.00 V versus MSE.
That peak is generally attributed to a further reduction of NO2– to ammonia or other products.15 The onset of the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) occurs at −1.40 V. The red dotted (alloy) and green dotted
(pure Cu) curve both obtained without NO3– ions in the solution are provided for comparison with catalysts
basically exhibiting only HER activity. The orange curve shows no
activity for pure Au toward nitrate electroreduction in solution where
there is an abundance of NO3– ions. This
result is consistent with pure Au activity test reported in the literature.15,56,57

Figure 6 Nitrate electroreduction CV curves in
10 mM HClO4 with
and without 10 mM HNO3 showing the catalytical activities
of bulk Cu, bulk Au, Cu ultrathin film, and Cu0.53Au0.47 catalysts (both deposited by 15 SLRR cycles). The sweep
rate is 20 mV s–1.

The reduction behavior of Cu0.53Au0.47 ultrathin
film in the presence of NO3– ions appears
to be a one-step reduction process. More specifically, unlike pure
Cu and Cu ultrathin films,17,19,58 the reduction curve of Cu–Au bimetallic catalyst features
only one peak at −1.05 V versus MSE. This peak is also about
50% higher in the same potential range than the pure Cu one. Negative
to that range, the HER starts taking place on the alloy surface at
the same potential as pure Cu.

So far, many researchers have
proved that polycrystalline Au catalysts
exhibit no activity in nitrate reduction scenarios.15,56,57 However, the density functional theory (DFT)
calculation has proved that H adsorption albeit much weaker than Pt
and Pd59 still takes place on Au. The Au
atoms could be then considered as optimal sites for H adsorption and
further reaction instead of centers only holding strongly H atoms
on the surface like Pt or Pd. At the same time, Cu is among the best
catalysts for nitrate electroreduction,25,58 although it
has the disadvantages of undergoing spontaneous dissolution in acidic
solution20 and being prone to passivation
with the reduction testing cycles.17,19 Therefore,
owing to the dramatically different affinities of Au and Cu to nitrate
reductive conversions, the Cu–Au bimetallic catalyst appears
to support a different reduction mechanism from the pure Cu. This
alloy combination exhibits better activity than pure Cu and Cu ultrathin
films in the potential range between −0.90 and −1.20
V (second peak position). Possible reasons for this enhanced activity
are as follows: (i) In the bimetallic catalysts, Cu atoms could be
perceived as sites for nitrate adsorption (see eq 6), whereas Au atoms could be sites for H+ adsorption, as shown in eq 5 in the same potential range. This is in agreement
with the results in Figure 6 whereby the pure Au polarization curve (solid orange curve)
suggests an ongoing HER activity in the potential range of interest.
In turn, this HER activity can provide sufficient amount of adsorbed
H as a powerful reducing agent for nitrate reduction, reactivation
of passivated Cu sites, and thus for promotion of the entire reaction,
as demonstrated by eqs 1 and 7. The equations are listed below 5   6   7  (ii) The lattice structure
and electronic
structure of a Cu–Au bimetallic catalyst is different from
pure Cu as directly manifested by a larger lattice parameter and a
shift of d-band center.60,61 Given that, the binding
energy between NO3– ions and the Cu–Au
catalyst surface may become optimal and thus beneficial for promotion
of the reduction reaction. On the other hand, according to the previous
calculation, the nitrate establishes bidentate adsorption configuration
on both Au and Cu,16,62 in which two oxygen atoms connect
to surface and the other oxygen atom is exposed to solution; hydronium
adsorbed on sites surrounded by NO3– ions
could form a bond with oxygen of neighboring NO3– to facilitate the nitrate reduction. As there is no comprehensive
study on the application of Cu–Au catalyst system in nitrate
electroreduction process, a further reduction product analysis and
DFT calculation will be required in the future for better understanding
of this matter.

2.5 Effect of Cu/Au Atomic
Ratio on Nitrate Electroreduction
Activity
In the synthetic part of this work, routines for
the SLRR deposition of bimetallic catalysts Cu/Au with atomic fraction
ratio from 0.50 to 0.90 have been developed. Figure 7 summarizes results on the influence of the
increasing Cu amount on the Cu–Au alloy catalyst activity.
It is clearly seen in that all compositions containing between 0.50
and 0.80 fractions of Cu exhibit similar catalytic activity manifesting
itself through a curve with one very dominant peak, as already presented
in Figure 6 for a Cu0.53Au0.47 catalyst. On a relative basis, maximum
activity is obtained with Cu0.70Au0.30 alloy.
Higher or lower Cu content leads to relatively lower activity thus
making the Cu fraction/activity dependence to look like a volcano
shape relationship. With the increase of the Cu fraction in Cu–Au
catalysts, the activity decreases to a value same as seen with pure
Cu catalyst. It is noteworthy that the transition to two-peak curves
occurs when the atomic fraction of Cu is equal or higher than 0.90.
For the Cu with an atomic fraction less than 0.50, the nitrate electroreduction
activity drastically decreases to that of a pure Au, which is catalytically
inactive.

Figure 7 Nitrate electroreduction CV curves showing the catalytical activity
of pure gold and Cu/Au (deposited by 15 SLRR cycles) solution ratios:
1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 10:1 in 10 mM HClO4 and 10 mM HNO3. The sweep rate is 20 mV s–1.

The possible mechanism for this behavior is associated
with a change
of the atomic fraction ratio on the catalyst surface. When Cu is more
abundant on the surface (more than 0. 90 atom fraction), the Au sites
are undoubtedly less accessible. In that case, the nitrate electroreduction
activity curve should be practically identical with the activity of
pure Cu. In contrast, if the Cu atomic fraction is less than 0.50
in Cu–Au, the Cu sites for nitrate adsorption will be limited
on the catalyst surface, as the dominating phase or element on the
catalyst surface could be Au3Cu or Au, respectively; these
two catalysts mostly favor the HER that is readily enabled in this
potential region. In other words, due to lack of adsorbed NO3– ions, adsorbed H atoms mostly combine with each
other to generate H2 gas. As a result, in that case, catalysts
become practically inactive in nitrate electroreduction process.

2.6 Catalyst Durability Tests
In this
section, nitrate reduction durabilities of pure Cu and Cu–Au
have been tested in 10 mM HClO4 + 10 mM HNO3 solution for 100 cycles. Figure 8 shows the CV diagram obtained from pure Cu immersed
in the testing solution, whereby the reduction activity decreases
substantially with the number of cycles. Figure 9 shows the CV diagram obtained from Cu–Au
bimetallic catalysts in the same solution. It is clearly seen that
unlike in the previous case, the catalyst retains a high reduction
activity with the number of cycles. A quantitative look into the comparison
of results presented in Figures 8 and 9 suggests activity decrease
for the Cu–Au catalyst to 55% versus a decrease to 35% for
the pure Cu catalyst at a potential between −0.9 and −1.1
V after 92 cycles. This comparison clearly proves that Cu–Au
catalyst exhibits significantly better durability in the nitrate electroreduction
process.

of polycrystalline Cu in 10 mM HClO4 with 10 mM HNO3 for 92 cycles. The sweep rate is 20 mV s–1.

Figure 9 Nitrate electroreduction CV curves showing the
catalytical durability
of Cu0.70Au0.30 alloy film (deposited by 15
SLRR cycles) in 10 mM HClO4 and 10 mM HNO3 for
92 cycles. The sweep rate is 20 mV s–1.

Previous research proves that pure Cu catalysts
experience spontaneous
dissolution and hydrogen poisoning in acidic solution.5,8,18 Cu0.70Au0.30 bimetallic catalysts show better durability in nitrate electroreduction
compared with monometallic Cu. One of the explanations for better
durability of Cu0.70Au0.30 catalyst is due to
the usage of noble-metal Au. As largely discussed earlier in this
paper, Au stabilizes the Cu by forming a single-phase alloy or intermetallic
compounds both being substantially more stable in acidic solution.
In addition, some researchers ascribe the passivation of pure Cu catalyst
to the adsorbed H atoms that block the Cu sites. It is well known
that Au is a weak adsorption substrate for H atoms. Thus, it is deemed
likely that the addition of Au could make the Cu active sites less
prone to H adsorption as well.

2.7 Effect
of pH on Nitrate Electroreduction Activity
In this section,
the pH dependence of nitrate electroreduction
has been studied on pure Cu and Cu0.70Au0.30 bimetallic catalysts. Figure 10 displays the CV diagram of Cu and Cu0.70Au0.30 behavior at pH 5.50 and 3.00. The comparison of
all curves shows that the nitrate electroreduction is very pH sensitive
on both catalysts; in other words, the H+ plays an important
role in promoting the activity of nitrate electroreduction reaction.
If one compares the green long dashed (pH 5.50) and the blue dashed
(pH 3.00) curves in Figure 10 with the blue dotted line (pH 2.00) in Figure 7 that features a similar curve shape but
a lot higher current density, the observed trend clearly suggests
that the highest nitrate electroreduction activity on Cu0.70Au0.30 alloy is registered at highest concentration of
H+, i.e., at lowest pH. It is known that NO3– ions need to be adsorbed on catalyst surface
before their reduction. At higher pH, the OH– can
occupy the Cu active sites, resulting in the inhibition of nitrate
adsorption and the oxidation of the Cu sites.5,63 Earlier
studies on related phenomenology clearly suggest the presence of adsorbed
oxygen species hundreds of millivolts negative to the Cu/Cu2O reduction potential.64 On the other
hand, according to reaction 1 and the role of adsorbed H discussed previously, H+/adsorbed H could facilitate the nitrate reduction process by eliminating
the oxidation on Cu active sites.16,19 The anodic
peak of bulk Cu at pH 5.00 could be attributed to the deadsorption
of NO3– or OH–, which
means that the respective lack of H+ significantly slows
down the nitrate electroreduction reaction. Overall, to increase the
nitrate electroreduction activity in the process of nitrates’
removal, it is essential to lower the pH of polluted ground water,
which brings another challenge of returning the pH to a neutral value
afterward.5

CV curves showing the catalytic activities
of bulk Cu and Cu0.70Au0.30 alloy film in 10
mM NaNO3 at pH 3.00 and 5.50, respectively. The sweep rate
is 20 mV s–1.

3 Conclusions
Bimetallic Cu–Au
ultrathin-film catalysts were first synthesized
via the E-ALD method utilizing SLRR of Pb UPD layer. The XPS and anodic
stripping results clearly demonstrated that the SLRR method is advantageous
for deposition of homogeneous and continuous films with controllable
composition and thickness. The nitrate electroreduction activities
of Cu–Au ultrathin film, Cu ultrathin film, bulk Cu and bulk
Au were also comparatively studied. Our results confirmed that pure
Au catalysts were inactive in the nitrate electroreduction process.
In contrast, Cu–Au bimetallic ultrathin films were found to
be more active than pure Cu or Cu ultrathin films, especially at potentials
more negative than −0.85 V versus MSE. The reason for the enhanced
activity can be ascribed to Hads atoms accommodated selectively
on the Au sites at around –0.95 V versus MSE. These atoms are
believed to act as reducing agents thus facilitating the entire reaction.
Further work focused on identification of products and intermediates
of the reaction on Cu–Au ultrathin-film catalysts is planned
in the future. Also, DFT calculations would be a necessary addition
for further explanation of the mechanism of this phenomenon.

The durability of the studied bimetallic and monometallic catalysts
was also tested for up to 92 potential cycles. The Cu0.70Au0.30 ultrathin film showed better durability than monometallic
Cu. A hindered spontaneous Cu dissolution and minimized hydrogen poisoning
by adding Au as more-noble metal to Cu were both identified as possible
reasons for the better durability of alloy/bimetallic catalyst. Finally,
studies of the impact of H+ ions on nitrate electroreduction
suggested the highest activity in the lowest pH solution of both Cu0.70Au0.30 and pure Cu film catalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Electrode Preparation
The working
electrodes used for all electrochemical and morphological characterization
experiments in this work are polycrystalline gold and polycrystalline
copper, Au (poly) disks (0.9999 purity) and Cu (poly) of 6 mm diameter
and 2 mm thickness. The Au and Cu surface preparation was initiated
by mechanical polishing down to 1 μm using water-based, deagglomerated
alumina slurry (Buehler). After polishing, Cu electrode was thoroughly
rinsed with Barnstead Nanopure water (18.2 MΩ cm). The Au electrodes
were immersed in warm concentrated HNO3 to remove any trace
contaminants before thorough rinsing with Barnstead Nanopure water
(18.2 MΩ cm). The Au crystals were then annealed to red hot
in a propane torch for 5 min before being cooled rapidly in an ultrapure
nitrogen atmosphere and finally covered with a droplet of the Barnstead
Nanopure water to prevent surface contamination.

4.2 Cell Setup
In the electrochemical
cells, the electrodes were immersed and held in a hanging meniscus
configuration.65 All electrochemical experiments
were performed in three-electrode setup using solutions made with
Barnstead Nanopure water and ultrahigh purity grade chemicals as received
from the vendors. A saturated mercury–mercurous sulfate electrode
with a potential of 0.650 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode was
used as reference electrode in most experiments unless stated otherwise
in the text. Also, a Pt wire served as the counter electrode (CE)
in all experiments. All potentials in the manuscript are presented
versus MSE, and all current densities are normalized with respect
to the geometric area of the electrode. All electrolytes used in deposition
and characterization routines were purged with ultrapure N2 for at least 30 min before the experiments.

4.3 Characterization
of Au Electrodes before and
after Deposition
Pb UPD CV was performed on the electrodes
to analyze the Au surface and electrochemical surface area development.
The Pb UPD solution contained 100 mM NaClO4 (Sigma, 99.95%),
10 mM HClO4 (GFS Chemical, 70% redistilled), and 3 mM Pb(ClO4)2 (Aldrich, 99.995%). A Pb wire was used as a
pseudoreference electrode (PRE), and a Pt wire was used as a counter
electrode. Measurements were performed using Princeton Applied Research
model 273 potentiostat/galvanostat coupled with CorrWare Software.
The same setup and software were used also in all other electrochemical
experiments in this work.

4.4 Cu–Au and Pure Cu
Ultrathin-Film Growth
The deposition of Cu–Au ultrathin
films on polycrystalline
Au surface was conducted by SLRR of Pb UPD in a single three-electrode
flask. The growth solution containing Y mM Cu(ClO4)2·2H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), Z mM NaAuCl4·2H2O (Premion, 99.99%),
1 mM Pb(ClO4)2 (Aldrich, 99.995%), 10 mM HClO4 (GFS Chemicals, 70% redistilled), and 100 mM NaClO4 (GFS Chemicals, 98%) was purged with ultrapure N2 for
at least 30 min. Six different solutions with [Cu2+]/[AuCl4–] molar ratios of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1,
and 10:1 were used to form CuxAu(1–x) ultrathin films. For realizing the ratio 1:2, Z was 0.50 mM and Y was 0.25 mM. For all
other ratios (starting with 1:1), Y was kept constant
at 0.50 mM, whereas the Z was decreasing from 0.50,
0.25, 0.17, 0.13, to 0.05 mM, respectively. The SLRR protocol consisted
of repeated steps of Pb UPD formation by a 1 s potential pulse to
−0.850 V (vs MSE) followed by a galvanic replacement taking
place at open-circuit potential (OCP). The cut-off potentials were
−0.25, −0.350, −0.400, −0.415, −0.425,
and −0.460 V (vs MSE) at Cu/Au solution ratio of 1:2, 1:1,
2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 10:1, respectively. A solution containing 0.5 mM
Cu(ClO4)2·2H2O (Alfa Aesar,
99.999%), 1.0 mM Pb(ClO4)2 (Aldrich, 99.995%),
10 mM HClO4 (GFS Chemicals, 70% redistilled), and 100 mM
NaClO4 (GFS Chemicals, 98%) was used for the deposition
of pure Cu ultrathin films, as described elsewhere.55 All deposition experiments were monitored by open-circuit
chronopotentiometry carried out with the potentiostat and software
mentioned above.

4.5 Cu Anodic Stripping
After deposition,
selective stripping of Cu from synthesized Cu–Au ultrathin
films was conducted by anodic stripping voltammetry in 1 mM CuSO4 and 100 mM HClO4 (GFS Chemical, 70% redistilled).
The experiments were performed by running anodic scans from 0.10 to
1.20 V versus Cu/Cu2+ PRE at a sweep rate of 1 mV s–1.

4.6 XPS Analysis
XPS
results were obtained
on a PHI 500 VersaProbe XPS equipped with Ar sputtering gun for surface
cleaning and depth profiling. A scanned and focused monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray beam was utilized to irradiate elements on the sample
surface. The emitted photoelectrons were captured and analyzed by
Hemispherical Analyzer with 16 channels. The atomic composition of
the prepared Cu–Au thin film was analyzed by binding energy
and intensity of the peak.

4.7 Nitrate Electroreduction
Testing
After composition analysis, the activities of prepared
Cu–Au
ultrathin film, polycrystalline Cu, polycrystalline Au, and Cu ultrathin
film were tested by running a CV in 10 mM HClO4 and 10
mM HNO3 over a potential range from −0.45 to −1.45
V (vs MSE) at a sweep rate 20 mV s–1. A durability
test was carried out by the repeating above-described CV process for
92 cycles.

4.8 pH Measurement and Adjustment
OAKTON
pH700 was employed to measure the pH of the solution. The pH meter
was calibrated by pH 7.00 buffer (Fisher, certified pH 6.99–7.01
@ 25 °C) and pH 4.00 buffer (Fisher, certified pH 3.99–4.01
@ 25 °C). The pH was controlled by tuning the concentration of
HClO4 from 10 to 0.01 mM.
