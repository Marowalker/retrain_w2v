Recently, two-dimensional MXenes and MXene-based nanocomposites
have become the most important electrode materials because of their
unique physical and chemical characteristics. As the electrode of
a lithium-ion capacitor, MXenes have exhibited metallic conductivity
and plastic layer structure that provide more chemically active interfaces
and shortened ion-diffusion lengths, and thus the unbalanced ion kinetics
between the anode and cathode can be effectively alleviated. In order
to further improve the electrochemical performance of MXenes, the
composition, morphology and texture, surface chemistry, and structural
configuration of MXenes are extensively investigated. In this mini-review,
some recent research and progress of MXenes and MXene-based nanocomposites
in lithium-ion capacitors are summarized, which focus on their nanostructure
designs and chemical preparation methods, such as prepillaring MXenes,
delaminated MXenes, and MXene-based hybrids. Finally, some future
perspectives and critical challenges of MXene-based material for lithium-ion
capacitor application are also presented and briefly discussed.

1 Introduction
Huge changes in the global
climate and the shortage of fossil fuels
require the society to acquire green and sustainable energy. Among
various renewable storage devices, electrochemical energy storage
(EES) devices stand out based on their high-energy efficiency and
high performance.1 Thus, they have been
extensively applied in portable electronic devices, smart grids, and
hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The energy density for state-of-the-art
lithium-ion battery (LIB) is about 200 Wh kg–1.
However, the intrinsic sluggish diffusion process of Li+ into the bulk material impedes the power performance of LIBs (usually
<2 kW kg–1), which causes an inferior acceleration
rate in HEVs.2 On the contrary, supercapacitors
(SCs), which are known for their high power density (>10 kW kg–1) and excellent cycling life (>105 cycles),
suffer from unsatisfactory energy density (about 5–10 Wh/kg)
since charge storage is mainly on/near the surface of porous materials.3 Hence, it is urgent to find an effective way
to achieve a trade-off between LIBs and SCs.

In recent years,
a new energy storage device lithium-ion capacitor
(LIC), which is assembled by a LIB-type anode and a SC-type cathode
with an appropriate electrolyte (contains lithium salt), has been
a hot topic in the complementation of LIBs and SCs.4 The charge capture mechanism for the LIC is illustrated
in Figure 1a.5 The energy storage and release for the conventional
LIB-type materials are primarily derived from the insertion/deinsertion
of the lithium ion, which are determined by the Li+ diffusion
rate into the bulk of material. Besides, PF6– from the electrolyte is rapidly absorbed/desorbed on/near the surface
of SC-type electrodes, and thus a considerable power density can be
achieved.6 Up to now, various constructions
of LICs have been reported with gratifying results. However, the obstacle
for practical application of LICs is still huge due to the limited
capacity of SC-type material and the imbalance of charge storage kinetic
between the two kinds of electrodes. These inevitably lead to the
capacity mismatch between the anode and cathode, resulting in a low
energy density of the LIC. Therefore, the critical issue in developing
high-performance LICs is to utilize suitable anode and cathode materials
with matched kinetics.

that makes up

So far, a variety of electrode materials have been
exploited in
the LIC devices. On account of the different Li-ion storage mechanisms,
the anode materials for LICs can be divided into three categories.10 First, insertion-type materials, such as graphite,
hard carbon, TiO2, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), and Nb2O5, have the advantage of stable
structure. However, the inferior capacity (<400 mAh g–1) or high-voltage platform versus Li metal impedes the full energy
utilization. Then the alloy-type (Si, Sn, and Sn-based composites)
and conversion-type (Fe3O4, CoO, MoS2, and MnO2) materials can deliver high theory capacity
(>700 mAh g–1). Nevertheless, the high irreversible
capacity, huge volume variation, and poor kinetics of these materials
cause severe electrode polarization and capacity decay during the
long-term cycling. Hence, for LIC anode materials, the key issues
are fixating on improving the electronic/ion conductivity and cycle
stability. From this aspect, materials with well-designed or nanosized
structure can effectively shorten the Li+ diffusion path
and improve the electron transport.11 At
present, carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon (AC), graphene,
and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the frequently used materials in LIC
cathodes. Among various SC-type materials, AC has received wide attention
due to its high special surface area, simple preparation, and low
cost. However, its large narrow and tortuous pore channels prevent
the diffusion of the electrolyte ion, and the relatively low electron
conductivity causes an inferior capacity. Thus, cathode materials
with large surface area and suitable pore-size distribution can effectively
improve the capacity and power performance of LICs.

Recently,
two-dimensional (2D) materials have triggered a new round
of research hotspots since their unique structure affords more access
in contact with the electrolyte and improves the ion transport rate.
Graphene, as the first successfully prepared 2D material, has the
advantages of remarkably electric conductivity, high surface area
(∼2630 m2/g in theory), and excellent thermal stability.12 However, the low tap density and suffering from
restacking of 2D graphene prevent it from suitable electrode materials
for the LIC applications.13 MXenes, which
are known as the rising star in the family of 2D materials, consist
of transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (generally
denoted as Mn+1XnTx, where M stands for an early
transition metal Ti (Nb et al.), X is the C or N element, and Tx indicates different surface termination
polar groups such as −OH, −O, and −F).14 MXenes are always prepared by selectively extracting
the A element layers (A is generally the main group IIIA or IVA) from
the corresponding three-dimensional Mn+1AXn (n = 1–3)
phases (Figure 1b,c).
MXenes have been extensively investigated in various applications,
especially as a high-performance electrode in LIBs and SCs, which
are ascribed to their metallic conductivity (up to 105 S/m),15 high density (∼3.8 g/cm3),16 mechanical stability, and excellent hydrophilicity.17 Moreover, the abundant active sites and negatively
charged surfaces of 2D MXenes result in the great capability of charge
storage and release.18 Stimulated by these
exciting properties, MXenes are becoming promising candidate materials
for the next-generation LIC application, and plenty of infusive achievements
based on MXenes have emerged. Hence, it is necessary to update the
latest developments of MXenes or MXene-based materials.

In this
mini-review, we are committed to summarizing the recent
research progress of MXenes and their derivatives in advanced LIC
devices. At first, a short introduction for the electrode materials
of LICs is provided. Subsequently, we propose to give a comprehensive
and vital summary of the latest advanced MXene or MXene-based materials,
which are used as the electrodes for high-performance LICs. Finally,
there are some critical challenges and outlooks of 2D MXene materials
generalized to highlight the future direction of LICs.

2 Applications to Lithium-Ion Capacitors
As a hybrid electrochemical full cell, the LIC needs a large-capacity
anode with reversible Li+ intercalation to achieve advanced
electrochemical energy storage. MXenes, including Ti3C2Tx, Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx,
and V2CTx, possess novel ultrathin
and open-layer structure, which relieve the sluggish intercalation/deintercalation
kinetics of Li ions. So, MXenes present nonideal battery behavior
but are similar to a capacitor, which indicates their application
in lithium-ion capacitors.19,20 Furthermore, the energy
storage property, electronic transmission speed, and stability of
MXenes are affected significantly by functional groups (−F,
−OH, −O, −Cl) on the surface of MXene layers.

2.1 Ti3C2Tx MXenes
Ti3C2Tx, the typical representative among MXenes, is extensively studied
according to its metallic conductivity and great chemical stability
in fluoride-based acidic solutions.21 Ti3C2Tx is prepared through
selectivelu etching Al layers from the Ti3AlC2 (MAX) in HF and LiF/HCl. Therefore, various termination groups (−OH,
−F, −O, −Cl), which affect its physical and chemical
properties, are carried out on the Ti3C2Tx surface.22 In
addition, these functional groups are in between Ti3C2Tx layers and function as “pillars”,
leading to an original interlayer spacing of 0.977 nm for the unmodified
Ti3C2Tx.5 Moreover, the stable interlayer space facilitates
the contact between the Ti3C2Tx surface and electrolyte ions. Yet, according to previous reports,
the existence of “pillars” on the surface of Ti3C2Tx may reduce the
storage capacity for Li+.17 When
the Ti3C2Tx is used
as an anode for the lithium half-cell, only 70–225 mAh g–1 (gravimetric capacity) can be realized, and even
the theoretical capacity of Ti3C2Tx is predicted to be 320 mAh g–1.4 So, if the interlayer space of Ti3C2Tx is rationally
increased and utilized, the ability of fast Li-ion (de)intercalation
will be further improved. Meanwhile, the unbalanced ion kinetics between
the faradaic battery-type anode and the nonfaradaic capacitive cathode
in LICs will be reduced.

One effective solution is to use electrochemical
active materials acting as pillars, which can effectively exploit
the potential storage space and resolve the low capacity issue for
unmodified Ti3C2Tx. Tang et al. prepared Ti3C2Tx@Fe2O3 nanocomposites via a kind of surfactant
and then used them as an anode for LICs (Figure 2a).23 Fe2O3 hollow nanospheres are uniformly and perpendicularly
located on the Ti3C2Tx surface (Figure 2b–d). The interlayer space of multilayered Ti3C2Tx (0.977 nm) (Figure 2e) is much larger than the
diameter of Li+ (0.76 Å). As shown in Figure 2g–l, elemental mapping
proves that Fe2O3 in between the interlayer
of Ti3C2Tx is evenly
distributed. Furthermore, the nanocomposites can achieve a fast Li-ion
(de)intercalation kinetics and an impressive specific capacity of
1180 mAh g–1 at a current density of 0.1 A g–1 (Figure 2m). Afterward, an LIC is assembled based on the Ti3C2Tx@Fe2O3 anode and the three-dimensional nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped porous
carbon (NS-DPC) as the cathode (Figure 2n). In this system, the capacitor-type cathode has
rich mesoporous structure, and the ion diffusion distance between
the proton and electrolyte is short; therefore, the rate capability
of the LIC device can be enhanced. The Ti3C2Tx@Fe2O3//NS-DPC
LIC can achieve a high energy density (216 Wh kg–1) with a power density of 400 W kg–1. Moreover,
the CV curves (Figure 2o) present a quasi-rectangular shape, which implies a better capacitive
behavior and fast charge/discharge rate of LICs. The GCD curves shown
in Figure 2p have near-linear
slope and a specific capacity of 109 mAh g–1 (at
0.2 A g–1), which based on the total mass of the
active substance for both the cathode and anode can be achieved. In
addition, the LIC delivers a prolonged cycle life with 87% of the
initial capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g–1 (Figure 2q).

Similar to the work of Ti3C2Tx@Fe2O3//NS-DPC
LIC, Luo et
al. prepared a pillared MXene (CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2) anode by a facile liquid-phase cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
prepillaring and Sn4+ pillaring method (Figure 3a).5 The interlayer distance of Ti3C2Tx reaches 2.230 nm in comparison with the original
size of 0.977 nm. Even though stearyltrimethylammonium bromide (STAB)@Ti3C2 (50 °C–60 °C) has the largest
interlayer space (2.708 nm), the high temperature causes the formation
of partial TiOx on the surface of Ti3C2Tx (Figure 3b). By immersing CTAB@Ti3C2 in SnCl4 solution, CTA+ can successfully integrate Sn4+ into CTAB@Ti3C2 (Figure 3c,d) via an ion-exchange mechanism. The elemental mappings of Ti
and Sn confirm that Sn4+ is inserted in the interlayer
space of CTAB@Ti3C2 (Figure 3e,f). Furthermore, an LIC is assembled with
CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 as the anode and AC as the
cathode (Figure 3g).
The CV curves of LIC are presented in Figure 3h. The deviation from the expected rectangular
shape is caused by the different energy-storage mechanisms between
the anode and cathode, but the shape can still maintain unchanged
as the scan rates increase from 2 to 20 mV s–1.
The GCD profiles of CTAB@Ti3C2//AC LIC exhibit
a symmetry triangular shape in Figure 3i. Based on the total active substance mass of the
anode and cathode, the LIC device can reach an excellent capacitance
of 51 F g–1, and the LIC confirms a high energy
density of 105.56 Wh kg–1 at the power density of
495 W kg–1. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 3j, the LIC can maintain 71.1%
of initial capacity at the current density of 2 A g–1 after 4000 cycles.

Previous studies have revealed that the delaminated
MXenes can
store more charge than their multilayer counterparts.24 The facile functional groups (T) on the surface of Ti3C2Tx determine that
the binding forces of the interlayer are weak hydrogen bonding and
van der Waals’ force. It provides a higher possibility to acquire
delaminated Ti3C2Tx through intercalating dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetrabutylammonium
hydroxide (TBAOH), or cation into the interlayer space.25 Meanwhile, MXenes have good mechanical property
that allow them to be shaped into thin films by rolling or vacuum
filtration.9 The freestanding MXene films
can be directly employed as the electrodes without other current collectors
such as Cu and Al metals. This unique flexibility is very beneficial
for reducing the overall mass of the device and preparing the flexible
LICs. Yu et al. mixed a delaminated Ti3C2Tx with carbon nanotubes to fabricate a self-supporting
film anode (Ti3C2Tx/CNT) for LIC. In order to obtain delaminated Ti3C2Tx, the cationic reagent TBA+ is used as intercalation, and then ultrasonic treatment is
employed.4 As shown in Figure 4a, Ti3C2Tx is delaminated into a few or single
layer, and the edge of delaminated Ti3C2Tx is discovered to be curved (Figure 4b), which demonstrates that
its flexibility is identical to that of graphene. Moreover, the delaminated
Ti3C2Tx nanosheets
and CNTs under the vacuum filtration conditions can prepare a free-standing
electrode (Figure 4c). As a pillar, the CNT looks like fishing nets wrapping the delaminated
Ti3C2Tx, which can
prevent the restacking of Ti3C2Tx and increase its conductivity. The LIC, which is
assembled by Ti3C2Tx/CNT as an anode and AC as a cathode, confirms an energy density
of 67 Wh kg–1 (based on the total mass of Ti3C2Tx/CNTs and AC).
Even at a power density of 5.79 kW kg–1, the energy
density can still reach 19 Wh kg–1. Furthermore,
after 5000 cycles at 2 A g–1, the capacity retention
of LIC is 81.3%, and the Coulombic efficiency is nearly 100% during
the cycling test (Figure 4f).

2.2 M2XTx MXenes
The structure of MXenes can be represented via the
general formula Mn+1XnTx.22 Compared to the M3 (“M” chemistry) and
M4 structures, their M2 counterparts show higher
Li-ion specific capacities because M2 has less layers (2
layers) compared with previous 5 and 7 atomic layers.24 Yamada et al. assembled a LIC device, which is comprised
of the intercalation-type (LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2) electrode and pseudocapacitive electrode
(Ti2CTx).21 The relationship between various surface termination groups
(T) on Ti2CTx and the interlayer
distance (dinter) is also analyzed. As
shown in Figure 5a–c,
different from etching in HF (7.7 Å), the Ti2CTx synthesized by LiF/HCl carries a longer dinter (8.7 Å). The reason is the presence
of the new component of the termination group (T = −Cl), and
the dinter for surface termination (T)
combinations presents a continuous increase with the addition of −Cl.
The enlargement of interlayer spacing offers a fast ionic accessibility
to redox centers, thus exhibiting higher intercalation pseudocapacitance.
As demonstrated in Figure 5d, 250 mAh g–1 capacity of the Ti2CTx is much larger than that of LiF/HCl
etching of Ti3C2Tx (150 mAh g–1). In addition, the permeation of
solvent molecules will further increase the interlayer space during
the charging–discharging process. The rate performance of LICs
is usually limited by the diffusion capacity of lithium ions. In this
system, the interlayer space is expanded with the embedding of −Cl,
and the large interlayer space boosts the faster Li-ion diffusion.
Thus, at a sweep rate less than 2 mV s–1, the capacitance
of diffusion control in Ti2CTx (LiF/HCl) is the largest among various Tin+1CnTx (Figure 5e). Therefore,
Ti2CTx (LiF/HCl) as the capacitor-type
anode for LIC can provide a higher rate capability. A Li-ion hybrid
capacitor is assembled as shown in Figure 5f, exhibiting a high capacity of 206 mAh
g–1 in a voltage window of 2.58 V, and 84% of capacity
is maintained after the 100 cycles (Figure 5g). Meanwhile, the LIC displays an energy
density (160 Wh kg–1) at a power density (220 W
kg–1) based on the total active materials.

According to the experimental data of the lithium
half battery,
the specific capacities of Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx are less than that of Nb2CTx and V2CTx. The delaminating
process of Nb2CTx often uses
different chemical approaches than that of Ti3C2Tx. Olha et al. reported the delamination
of Nb2CTx using amine instead
of DMSO. Then, the Nb2CTx paper
was obtained by mixing the delaminated Nb2CTx suspension with CNTs and filtering through a polyester
membrane. The Nb2CTx/CNT paper
electrode shows a high volumetric capacitance of 325 F cm–3.24 Ayeong et al. demonstrated three proof-of-concept
type LICs based on TBAOH-delaminated Nb2CTx/CNT electrodes. The Nb2CTx/CNT can be paired with either a graphite anode or
a LiFePO4 cathode. Furthermore, a symmetric capacitor is
assembled using the Nb2CTx/CNT
electrodes as the anode and cathode (Figure 6a–i).19 Three type of LIC devices are capable of operating within a 3 V
voltage window and delivering stabilized capacities of 43, 24, and
36 mA g–1, respectively. Continuous cycling of LICs
demonstrated long lifespan for all three types of LICs, and the volumetric
energy densities of all LICs are 50–70 Wh L–1 (based on the volume of electrodes), which exceed the energy density
of the conventional LTO/AC LIC.

In general, all kinds of MXenes display a layered
structure, and
the skeleton atoms of MXenes follow the ABABA or ABCABC arrangement.
Meanwhile, the terminated groups (−F, −OH, −O,
et al.) on the surface of MXenes directly influence their chemical/physical
properties and then determine the performance of MXenes in their applications.
In the field of energy storage, MXenes are often used as a substrate
and further improve the performance through a series of chemical modifications.
Through analyzing the electrochemical data of LICs assembled using
MXenes or MXene composites, the capacitance is mainly a diffusion-controlled
contribution, and it is worth noting that the surface control contribution
cannot be ignored. Therefore, MXene materials have shown great potential
in the lithium-ion capacitors.

3 Conclusions and Outlook
In summary,
searching the novel electrode materials for a lithium-ion
capacitor plays a really important role in development of electrochemical
energy storage. MXenes, as the new star in the family of 2D materials,
have attracted increasing attention because of their metallic skeleton,
structural varieties, and substantial surface termination groups.
The 2D nature of MXenes provides large surface areas for lithium-ion
storage and boosts the fast ion transport. It is observed that MXenes
exhibit some potential as a substrate material for the lithium-ion
capacitor. Meanwhile, it has been proven that the surface terminations
such as −OH, −O, −F, or −Cl greatly affect
the structural characteristic and electrochemical performance of MXenes.
These functional groups and the binding force of the MXene interlayer
are weak hydrogen bonding and van der Waals’ force, and these
functional groups maintain a stable space in between the MXene layers.
The advantages of 2D MXenes for the lithium-ion capacitor have been
confirmed theoretically and experimentally. This mini-review is mainly
focused on the structural design and performance optimization of MXenes
by cation intercalation, delamination, and compositing with other
materials. Various lithium-ion capacitor systems assembled by MXenes
or MXene composites are summarized and discussed in detail. The main
electrochemical properties of these LICs are listed in Table 1. Although this paper is focused
on the research of MXenes for LICs, the preparation routes and structure
designs of MXenes and MXene-based materials, which possess ideal 2D
structure, large interlayer space, and metal conductivity, are also
valuable for studying Na+, K+, Mg2+, and other metal-ion hybrid capacitors.

Recently, the main disadvantage of the lithium-ion
capacitors is
their low energy density (compared to batteries), and the unmodified
MXene electrodes do not have considerable theoretical capacity. Thus,
anchoring the active substance on the nanosheets or delaminating the
multilayer to monolayer are the practicle methods to improve the electrochemical
performance of MXenes. Although abundant examples of 2D MXenes in
energy-storage applications have been performed, there are still some
underlying scientific issues for the structure-electrochemical property
to be addressed. First, the indispensability of the fluoride based
(HF and LiF) on the process of etchants increases the risk. Searching
for safe and reliable preparation methods is beneficial to the future
development of MXenes. Second, single-layer MXenes are fabricated
by delaminating multilayered MXenes in order to expose more lithium-ion
storage active sites, but the delaminated MXenes in aqueous solution
show a trend of restacking due to electrostatic interaction. Although
the introduction of other substances as pillars can expand the interlayer
space of MXenes, these also reduce the contact area between MXenes
and electrolyte that impede their intrinsic properties in some cases.
Third, since MXenes are unstable under ambient conditions, most MXenes
are easily oxidized and degraded during treatment. The exploitation
of the MXene-based hybrid system, such as anchoring self-assembly,
delamination, insertion, and anchoring, is impossible to completely
isolate oxygen and water. Therefore, the chemical stability control
of MXenes still needs further investigation. Fourth, because the surface
termination groups of MXenes are diverse and uncontrollable, the ion
kinetics and charge storage mechanism for MXenes remain not completely
clear. Compared to the lithium-ion battery, the main advantage of
LICs is its high power density, and the ion transport speed of the
battery-type electrode directly determines the rate performance of
the device. Thus, in-depth basic studies of the lithium-ion storage
mechanism for MXenes are needed tremendously.

Many breakthroughs
of MXene and MXene composites, which are used
as lithium-ion capacitor electrodes, have emerged in the past few
years. However, there is indeed a long way to go to find solutions
that balance various performances such as energy density and power
density, specific capacity, and life span. In order to address the
challenges, innovative works and practical applications of electrochemical
energy storage are still desirable to further explore.
