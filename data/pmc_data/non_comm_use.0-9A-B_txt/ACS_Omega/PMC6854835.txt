Efficient and large
area fabrication of amorphous photonic crystals (APCs) with multicolor,
angle independency, and fine resolution is always desired owing to
their application in color displays, sensors, and pigments. Here,
we report a polymer-assisted colloidal assembly (PACA) method to fabricate
APCs with brilliant structural colors by the co-assembly of silica
colloidal particles, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and carbon black
(CB). PVP is the key to enable the amorphous aggregations of the particles,
the uniform and noniridescent structural colors of the APCs. Moreover,
multicolor and high-resolution patterns can be prepared through the
mask-based brush printing with colloids–PVP–CB precursor
solution as ink (named as APCs-ink). The developed printing method
can be applied to various substrates with different roughness, curvature,
and flexibility such as papers, metals, plastic films, stones, and
even curved glasses. PACA is efficient and straightforward for the
fabrication of APCs and high-resolution patterns with large area,
low cost, and easy operation, which will facilitate their practical
applications in the fields of color-related display, green painting,
anticounterfeiting, and so on.

Introduction
Colloidal photonic
crystals and their bright structural colors are originated from the
interference and diffraction or scattering of the visible light by
their periodic nano/microstructures. These unique structural colors
have attracted considerable interests because of their practical applications
in color display,1−8 printing,9−12 sensor,13−22 anticounterfeiting,23,24 optical devices,25−27 solar cell,28−30 and photocatalysis.31,32 The reflection
peaks can be tuned by the particle sizes, the refractive index, or
the orientation of photonic crystals, while the angle independence
usually depends on the arrangement of particles. Generally, photonic
crystals with long-range ordered structures possess angle dependent
or iridescent structural colors at varied viewing angles, where angle
independent or noniridescent structural colors can be achieved when
the colloidal particles are packed into amorphous structures. Although
ordered photonic crystals exhibit brighter color saturation, their
colors are iridescent, which makes it confuse in the field of color
display, sensing, and so on. In this regard, amorphous photonic crystals
(APCs) with only short-range ordered structures and noniridescent
colors are identical photonic materials in the applications of color
displays,3,33−35 sensors,20 paintings,36 and
anticounterfeiting.37,38 However, the fabrication of APCs
is still a big challenge because of the strong crystallization tendency
of charged particles upon the assembly process.

The key to fabricate
APCs is to avoid the colloidal crystallization. Recently, various
strategies including spray method,35 bi-disperse
suspension,39−41 infiltration-assisted colloidal assembly,42 layer by layer (LBL),43 coating polymer or particles on the surfaces of particles,36,44,45 and electrophoretic deposition46 have been used to prepare APCs. For instance,
using the spray method, APC pigments can be obtained because the methanol
was rapidly evaporated from the colloidal solutions. This strategy
is successful in preparing APCs but subjected to the volatilization
speed of solvent. The infiltration-assisted colloidal assembly process
requires porous substrates, while the LBL need multisteps to prepare
APCs, both of which complicate the fabrication process. For particle
modification or other approaches, additional procedures are essential
and the amplified fabrication of APCs will be a problem and should
be carefully considered. From the above discussion, one can conclude
that the developed approaches for fabricating APCs usually require
harsh or complicate assembly conditions, and most of them are failure
in fabrication of APCs in large area. Therefore, a simple, efficient,
and convenient method for fabricating APCs in large area and with
a uniform noniridescent structural color is highly desired.

In this work, we report an efficient and straightforward polymer-assisted
colloidal assembly (PACA) route for the fabrication of APCs with noniridescent
structural colors, which were prepared by the coassembly of silica
colloidal particles, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and carbon black
(CB). The introduction of PVP not only enables the amorphous aggregations
of the particles and the angle independent structural colors in the
film but also contributes to the uniform structural colors of the
APCs. The APC-ink, an ethanol solution consisting of colloidal particles,
PVP, and CB can be used for printing patterns with multicolor and
high-resolution through maneuverable brush printing with masks. Moreover,
the brush printing can be applied to flat, curved, rough, and flexible
substrates, including paper, glass, metal, plastic film, and stones.
The developed PACA approach and brush printing are quite simple, efficient,
and convenient in fabrication of APCs and multicolor patterns with
large areas and low cost, which will promote their practical applications
in the field of structural color-based display, green painting, or
anticounterfeiting.

Results and Discussion
The procedure
for fabricating APC films by PACA is illustrated in Figure 1a. Monodispersed silica particles,
nanosized CB, and PVP were mixed into ethanol to obtain the precursor
solution, which was then cast on the glass to form APC films after
solvent evaporation. The introduction of CB into the APCs enhanced
the color saturation of the film because the CB could absorb the incoherent
scattering of light and enhance the coherent scattering of light effectively.
The addition of PVP has two advantages on the formation of amorphous
structures and uniform structural colors: (1) the PVP chains could
be absorbed onto the surfaces of the silica particles, which reduced
the repulsion between the silica particles, and caused the aggregation
of the particles into amorphous structures; (2) the aggregation tendency
of the nanosized CB could be avoided because of strong absorption
capacity of the PVP on the surfaces of CB particles, which resulted
in the uniform structural colors.

of APCs. (b) Digital photo, (c) SEM image of APCs, and (d) reflection
spectra of ten random points of the fabricated APCs. Edge length of
the APCs is 20 * 10 cm. Photos in all figures were taken by Yang Hu,
and all the images in this work is free domain.

It is noteworthy that PACA is efficient in fabricating APCs in large
area and a short time, as can be seen in Figure 1b, green APC films with uniform structural
colors and a large area of about 200 cm2 were prepared
in 5 min by the coassembly of 252 nm silica colloids, 1% CB (in wt,
to silica particles), and 2.5% PVP (in wt, to silica particles). The
scale-up is remarkably simple and efficient through simple amplification
of the amounts of regents, and no additional equipment or procedures
are need. The corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1c) image of the APC
films showed that the silica particles were packed very close to each
other with short-range ordered but long-range disordered structures.
The ring-like pattern (inset in Figure 1c) of the corresponding 2D fast Fourier-transform images
of APCs implied the short arrangement of the silica particles, and
the orientation of the short-range ordered structures was equivalent
along diverse angles. The APCs exhibit uniform structural colors because
the CB particles (red arrows in Figure 1c) were uniformly distributed into the APCs, which
can be further confirmed by the similar reflection intensity of ten
random points form APCs (Figure 1d). Although the reflection intensity is not high enough,
APCs still show a bright structural color which can be well observed
by eyes and captured by cameras.

APCs showed noniridescent structural
colors that can be verified by naked eyes and angle dependent reflectance
spectra. The structural color of the green film remained nearly unchanged
when it was observed at broad viewing angles from 0 to 80° (Figure 2a) because of the
only short-range ordered structures of APCs. Furthermore, angle resolved
reflectance spectra were also used to determine the optical property
of the APCs, where the sample was fixed and detector was varied. As
shown in Figure 2b,
the reflection peaks located at 550 nm remained constant as the detector
changed from 0 to 80°, which was consistent well with the above
results. APC films with blue and red structural colors (Figure 2c,d) could be further fabricated
with particles of different sizes through a similar procedure, both
of which possessed amorphous structures with only short-ranged order
(Figure S1). Owing to the amorphous structures
of APCs, the blue and red films showed a noniridescent structural
color at various viewing angles.

spectra of APC films. Edge length of the square is 2.5 cm, and photos
were captured under viewing angles (0–80°).

The amorphous structures of APCs are mainly originated from
the hinder effect of PVP on the self-assembly of silica particles.
For colloids self-assembled in the absence of PVP, the silica particles
are randomly moved into the solution because of the Brownian motion
of the particles. These silica particles are stabilized by the balance
between the repulsive and attractive interactions among the particles,
where the former one is arising from good charge separation of the
silica particles (particle-OH → particle-O– + H+), as supported by the large value of ζ-potential
(−45.3 mV, Figure 3a) of silica particles. As the solvent gradually evaporated,
the average distance between neighboring particles is reduced accordingly;
hence, the repulsive and attractive forces between silica particles
are progressively enhanced and a new balance is reached, which contributes
to the stability of the particles at a high concentration of particles
and leads to the long-range ordered structures in the end. In contrast,
when appropriate PVP was added into the colloidal solution, PVP chain
would be absorbed onto the surfaces of particles because of the strong
absorption ability of PVP, which was confirmed by the Fourier transform
infrared spectrum (FTIR, Figure S2). The
peaks ranged from 2800 to 3100 cm–1 are the typical
absorption bands of C–H from PVP, although the particles were
washed with ethanol three times with excess ethanol. This result vividly
proved the strong absorption of the PVP chain on the surfaces of the
silica particles. At this stage, the average size, polydispersity
index (PDI), and ζ-potential of the particles remained unchanged
(Figure 3a), indicating
such a low mass concentration of PVP had little influence on the repulsions
and stability of silica particles. As the solution slightly concentrated
over times, more and more PVP were supposed to be absorbed on the
surfaces of silica particles, which would hinder the charge separation
of particles and cause aggregation of particles. Silica particles
dispersed in PVP solution with various mass concentration were prepared
to simulate the drying process of the solution consisting of particles
(200 mg/mL) and PVP (0.5 mg/mL). As can be seen in Figure 3, the ζ-potential of
the particles decreased from −45.3 to −26.8 mV as the
PVP concentration increased from 0.5 to 5 mg/mL. These would lead
to the aggregation tendency of the particles, which can be verified
by the increased particle size (Figure 3b) and PDI, accordingly. Therefore, particles would
aggregate randomly upon the self-assembly process, which resulted
in the amorphous structures of APCs.

Figure 3 Effect of PVP on the (a) potential, PDI
and (b) average size of silica particles.

The structures of APCs obtained with a variety of PVP concentration
were systematically investigated in order to figure out the effect
of PVP on the assembly process. Photonic crystal films with nonuniform
structural color were fabricated when the silica particles were assembled
in the absence of PVP, owing to the cracks formed upon the assembly
process.47 The particles separated in the
film and can be observed from the optical microscopic image (Figure 4a), where the bright
green and the black regions correspond to the crystallization of silica
particles and CB aggregation, respectively. The microscopic reflection
signal (Figure 4b)
of the crystalline region is much higher than that of black region,
which is in agreement with the observation from the optical microscope.
Furthermore, the representative SEM images (Figure 4c,d) also demonstrate the crystalline region
with long-range ordered structures and the CB region of particle aggregation.

Figure 4 (a) Microscope
image (b) Microscopic reflectance spectra, and corresponding (c,d)
SEM images of photonic crystals fabricated with PVP (0 mg) and CB
(1%).

When PVP (0.1 mg/mL) was added
into the preassembly solution, long-range order still existed in the
photonic crystals (Figure 5d,g), but the particle separation seemed to be reduced (Figure 5a) compared to that
without PVP owing to the adsorption of PVP on the surfaces of CB particles,
which helped CB to be distributed uniformly in APCs. Hence, with PVP
concentration further increased to 0.5 mg/mL, the APC film with uniform
structural color was obtained (Figure 5b). The appearance of the APCs is quite uniform across
the whole film as observed by the naked eye. Ten random points of
the film were selected to measure the microscopic reflection intensity
in order to determine the uniformity of the APC film. The same reflection
intensity (Figure S3) strongly supports
the uniformity of the structural color because the CB particles are
well distributed into the APCs with the assistance of PVP. The APC
film shows constant structural color when the viewing angles are changed
from 0 to 80° because of the amorphous structures of the APCs.
The corresponding SEM images (Figure 5e,h) of the APC film show the silica particles were
packed closely to each other with only short-range ordered structures,
which is the typical characteristic of the amorphous structure. Further
increasing the PVP concentration to 1 mg/mL, APC films with angle
independent or noniridescent structural colors were obtained because
of the amorphous structures (Figure 5c,f,i). Combining the appearance color and structures
of the APCs, we believe the optimized concentration of PVP is about
0.5 mg/mL.

Figure 5 Effect of the PVP amount on the structures of photonic crystals.
Microscopic images and SEM images of photonic crystals obtained with
different amount of PVP, (a,d,g) 0.01, (b,e,h) 0.05, and (c,f,i) 0.1
mg. Area bars in (c,f), and (i) are 200 , 2 μm, and 500 nm,
respectively, and is applied to all the images in the same line.

Beside the PVP concentration, the weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) of PVP on the structures
of APCs was further examined. All the APC films prepared with different Mws of PVP exhibited a noniridescent structural
color (Figure S4) similar to that of original
sample, implying the Mw of PVP had little
effect on the particle arrangement of APCs.

As PVP show considerable
effects on the formation of APCs, one may wonder whether other polyelectrolytes
show similar effects when they are introduced upon the assembly process.
As shown in Figure S5, when PAA is used
to replace the PVP, the corresponding film exhibits intense reflection
but with extremely pale colors. Usually, PAA are dissociated with
negative charges in solution, which is not favored to be absorbed
on the surfaces of particles; hence, the PAA and particles precipitate
out separately form the solution. In contrast, muted colors can be
achieved as the PEI are used because of the strong absorption of PEI
on the surfaces of particles. However, the viscous PEI will induce
the low quality of APCs, as can be confirmed by the nonuniform colors
and ultralow reflection intensity. Therefore, it is reasonable to
conclude that the PVP is the most suitable polyelectrolyte for the
fabrication of APCs.

Except for the PVP, the addition of CB
particles into APCs plays a crucial role in determining the color
visibility and reflection intensity of APCs. When the APC film was
prepared in the absence of CB particles, the film exhibited a whitish
color (Figure 6a) caused
by the coherent light scattering because of the short-range order
of the amorphous structures. From the microscope reflectance spectra
of the film, we could see that the background line was very high across
the entire visible spectra (Figure 6d), indicating the incoherent light scattering was
strong. The incoherent scattering of light across the whole spectra
regions leads to the white appearance of APCs, which is unwanted and
should be eliminated. Hence, for the APCs with angle independent structural
color, additional material that could reduce the incoherent light
scattering efficiently is highly desirable.

Figure 6 Effect of the CB content
on the color visibility of APCs. (a–c) Microscopic images and
(d–f) reflectance spectra of APCs fabricated with a variety
of CB contents. Green, blue, and red structural colors represent the
APCs obtained with different particle sizes (a) 252, (b) 197, and
(c) 276 nm, respectively.

To achieve this goal, the introduction of black material into APCs
that can uniformly absorb light across the entire spectra region is
an effective route. CB shows intrinsic advantages of environmentally
friendly mass production and is used to absorb the unwanted incoherent
scattering light in the APCs. Microscopic reflectance spectra were
used to determine the optimal content of CB (Figure 6d). As 0.5% CB (mt ratio, CB/silica) was
added into APC precursor solution, the overall reflection intensity
of the obtained APC film was significantly reduced, and a pale green
structural color was obtained. With the CB content increased to 1%,
most of the incoherent scattering of lights were eliminated, resulting
in a saturated green structural color. However, the structural color
gradually turns form green to black when the CB content was gradually
increased to 4% because excess CB in the APC film would absorb the
coherent scattering of light. Except for the green structural color,
the blue (Figure 6b,e)
and red (Figure 6c,f)
APC films also showed similar color change tendency with addition
of various contents of CB (0–4%). According to reflectance
spectra and appearance (Figure S6) of APCs,
the optimal content of CB is determined to be about 1%.

Combing
the simple, efficient, and large-area fabrication characteristics
of APCs in the presented method, a mask-based brush printing technique
was used to print multicolor patterns (Figure 7). Generally, the brush printing technique
is finished by repeated operations including mask covering, brush
coating, and drying. The usage of the mask makes it possible to print
desired patterns of various structural colors on substrates or any
regions of the premade photonic paper. As shown in Figure 7a, the numerals, mathematical
operators, and other patterns with brilliant structural colors could
be printed on the papers. Through a similar process, multicolor patterns
(Figure 7b,c,e) with/without
colorful background could also be prepared by the brush printing method,
in which the using of the mask and the tuning of structural colors
with particles of different sizes are performed repeatedly. One can
record the change of reflection wavelength (Figure 7d) across the pattern along the route of
white arrows; thus, the information such as the color saturation and
particle size of a certain structural color can be acquired. Furthermore,
all the colorful patterns showed noniridescent or angle independent
structural colors at broad viewing angles (Figure S7). It should be noted that the boundary resolution was determined
by the distance between the substrate and the mask, and a reduced
distance will be helpful to obtain patterns with high resolution,
which was evidenced by the sharp corner of the pattern with the mask
tightly contacted with substrate (Figure S8). Besides the simple and convenient operation in creating a multicolor
pattern, another advantage of the brush printing is that it could
be printed on various substrates including flat and curved glasses,
resin, wall, rough stone, flexible paper, plastic film, and tin foil
paper (Figure 8). These
results clearly demonstrated the successful printing of multicolor
by the brush printing method in our work. By using delicate masks,
high-resolution patterns can be achieved through the brush printing
method (Figure 9).
Here, squares with length of 100 μm and stars with diameter
of about 120 μm could be printed on the substrate when stainless
steel grids with periodic grooves of square and star were used as
masks. The APC squares and stars were uniformly distributed on the
substrates, and the point resolution was measured to be 96 and 25
μm (Figure 9c,d),
respectively. The above results suggest that micropattern with noniridescent
structural color can be printed using the brush printing method.

Conclusions
In summary, a PACA method is reported to fabricate
APCs with noniridescent structural colors by the co-assembly of silica
colloidal particles, PVP, and CB into amorphous structures. The concentration
of PVP and CB were optimized to realize bright structural colors,
which can be controlled using particles with different diameters.
PVP plays a key role in the formation of only short-range ordered
structures of APCs through suppressing the crystallization of colloidal
particles upon assembly process, while the introduction of CB is crucial
for the color visibility of APCs by absorbing the incoherent scattering
of light. Such silica–PVP–CB mixed solution can be used
as APC-ink directly for photonic printing, as only brush and masks
are necessary for the developed brush printing. Multicolor and high-resolution
APC patterns with noniridescent structural colors can be easily fabricated
by using the mask-based brush printing method, which can be also applied
to flat, curved, rough, and flexible substrates, such as paper, glasses,
metal, plastic film, and stones. The fabrication method together with
APC-ink and the brush printing method investigated in the presented
work may disclose a potentially useful material system for fabricating
noniridescent structural color patterns in a more simple, efficient,
and economical way.

Experimental Section
Materials
PVPs
of different molecules (Mw: 40 000,
55 000, 30 000, and 1300 000) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. CB (30 nm) was purchased from Aladdin. Tetraethyl
orthosilicate (98%), ethanol (EtOH, 99%), and aqueous ammonia (28%)
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All the chemicals
are used as received without further purifications.

Fabrication
of APCs
Silica particles of tunable sizes were synthesized
by the well-known Stöber method. After purification, silica
particles were dispersed in ethanol with a concentration of 200 mg/mL.
For the fabrication of APCs, CB and PVP with the desired amount were
mixed with the silica colloidal dispersion (0.1 mL), which was then
dropped onto the glass. The glass was then heated to 50 °C for
2 min, and APCs with bright and noniridescent structural colors were
obtained.

Brush Printing of Patterned APCs
In brief, a mask with
a designed groove pattern was prepared using the craft punch mold,
and it was placed onto the photonic paper or the substrate. Then,
APC-ink with silica particles (2 g), PVP (0.5 mg), and CB (20 mg)
dispersed in ethanol (10 mL) were brushed onto the substrate to prepare
patterns using a brush bought in the market. After the solvent was
evaporated, the mask was removed and noniridescent structural color
pattern was obtained.

Characterization
The assembly structures
of APCs were investigated by using the HITACHI SEM-SU8010. FT-IR spectra
were obtained on a Thermofisher Nicolet IS50 FT-IR spectrometer ranging
from 4000 to 400 cm–1. The optical microscope images
and microscopic reflectance spectra were obtained on an Olympus BXFM
reflection-type microscope operated in a darkfield mode. The reflectance
and backscattering spectra at different angles were measured by using
a NOVA spectrometer (Hamamatsu, S7031). The reflection of the APC
film at various angles was detected by using the angle resolved detector
(R1) coupled with the spectra (NOVA). The ambient light was used as
the light source, and the detect angle was later changed from 0 to
80° relative to the normal to the surface of the sample. The
zeta-potential and the kinetic particle size was measured in the presence
of ethanol by using Malvern ZS 90.
