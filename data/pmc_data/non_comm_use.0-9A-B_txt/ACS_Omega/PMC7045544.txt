Herein, we present an industrially
applicable strategy to enhance
the heat resistance and adhesive properties of ABA triblock copolymer-based
elastomers composed of styrene (St) and n-butyl acrylate
(nBA) by incorporating acrylic acid (AA) at different
segments. Three types of triblock copolymers, namely, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA), poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St), and poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St), were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation
chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Large-scale RAFT polymerization
afforded industrially applicable AA-containing triblock copolymers
with moderate molecular weights and predetermined comonomer compositions
(St/nBA/AA = 15/83/2–24/73/3, number-average
molecular weight (Mn) = 30,000–110,000,
and resulting product > 200 g). The heat resistance and pressure-sensitive
adhesive properties of the triblock copolymers were evaluated. Among
them, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA),
having poly(nBA) as the middle soft segment and poly(St-r-AA) as hard segments at both ends, exhibited excellent
heat creep resistance and increased adhesiveness to stainless steel.
The feasibility to manipulate the heat resistance and adhesive properties
by incorporating AA units into hard and soft segments, in addition
to the ease of operation, high block efficiency, and metal-free nature
owing to the RAFT process, is highly beneficial for practical applications
of these copolymers.

Introduction
Thermoplastic elastomers,
which are typically ABA-type triblock
copolymers composed of glassy A end blocks and a rubbery B midblock,
have attracted significant attention owing to their processability
and recyclability.1−6 In industry, styrene (St)-based triblock copolymers, such as poly(St)-b-polybutadiene-b-poly(St) and poly(St)-b-polyisoprene-b-poly(St), have been widely
used as thermoplastic elastomers.7,8 ABA triblock
copolymers based on poly(alkyl acrylate) as the central soft block
have been investigated extensively as substitutes of traditional St-based
triblock copolymers because they exhibit better resistance to oxidation
and ultraviolet (UV) light.9 All-acrylic
block copolymers composed of acrylates having a long-chain pendant
alkyl group, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(alkyl
acrylate)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), have been
the focus of another recent study.2,10−14 Their interesting properties and functions, for example, as modifiers
of acrylic resins to improve their elongation and impact resistance,
can be tuned by using different acrylate monomers and by manipulating
their block lengths.

Over the past few decades, there has been
continuous interest in
pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) because of their extensive utilization
in everyday life (e.g., Scotch tape and Post-it notes) as well as
in modern technologies.15−17 The rational design of the chemical
structure and the architecture of the blocks as well as the incorporation
of specific functional units in the block copolymers are promising
approaches to develop high-performance PSAs.18−25 Acrylic-based PSAs are one of the most common classes of PSAs, which
are generally composed of n-butyl acrylate (nBA), 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2-EHA), acrylic acid (AA),
and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate as the main components.26−29 An industrial adhesive must display
durability over a wide range of conditions depending on the application
as well as cost-effective manufacturing at low cost. For example,
an optical adhesive for bonding an optical film (typified by a polarizing
plate or a phase difference film) to a display such as a liquid-crystal
panels needs to maintain its performance even under severe environmental
conditions, such as in-car and outdoor displays, and requires excellent
durability under the usage environment.30,31 It has been
proposed that to exhibit creep properties under a high-temperature
environment (heat creep resistance), the acrylic adhesive composition
should be in such a way that the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the acrylic copolymer is 1,000,000 or
more and that it is used in combination with a cross-linking agent.
However, the extremely high molecular weights increase the solution
viscosity and necessitate the use of a large amount of organic solvent
to adjust the viscosity and achieve desired coating properties. As
the acrylic adhesive composition includes a cross-linking agent, the
adhesive must be cured; unfortunately, curing occasionally reduces
the reliability of the adhesive performance owing to uneven cross-linkage.

Instead of the typical cross-linked acrylic adhesives, another
adhesive composition has been proposed with an acrylic triblock copolymer.32,33 This adhesive is classified as non-cross-linked because the lower
solution viscosity resulting from the use of a triblock copolymer
instead of an acrylic copolymer leads to improved coating properties.
However, because the adhesive composition has heat resistance up to
approximately 90 °C, a blend of a large number of adhesives is
required to achieve higher heat creep resistance.34,35 It has been proposed that creep resistance can be improved with
an adhesive composition where a silane coupling agent or an isocyanate
has been added to the acrylic triblock copolymer.36

In addition to traditional living anionic polymerization,
controlled
radical polymerization is frequently employed for the synthesis of
acrylic triblock polymers, which can be used as thermoplastic elastomers.37,38 Among the various controlled radical polymerizations, reversible
addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization
enables precise polymerization using a conventional radical initiator
(e.g., 2,2′-azobis(isobutyronitrile), AIBN), while maintaining
the wide applicability and reactivity of the monomers, and introduction
of polar functional groups, which has been considered difficult to
achieve by conventional ionic polymerization.39−43 Furthermore, RAFT polymerizations offer industry-oriented
syntheses, involving easy scale-up from a laboratory setting to a
commercial application. This motivated us to synthesize a novel adhesive
having both excellent adhesion to various adherends and heat resistance
by the RAFT process.

In this study, we proposed an industrially
applicable molecular
design of ABA triblock copolymer-based elastomers composed of St and nBA by incorporating AA at different segments for the enhancement
of heat resistance and adhesive properties (Figure 1). For the synthesis of the triblock copolymers
with AA units in different segments, RAFT polymerization was performed,
as it allowed us to introduce the functional AA unit and manipulate
the composition and chain lengths. As illustrated in Scheme 1, three ABA-type triblock copolymers,
namely, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA),
poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St), and poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St), were synthesized
by RAFT polymerization. In these triblock copolymers, the poly(St)
end blocks with a much higher glass-transition temperature (Tg) than room temperature should segregate periodically
from the middle block, which act as pseudo-cross-linking domains.
The incorporation of the AA unit in the hard domains may lead to an
increase in the pseudo-cross-linking derived from self-complementary
hydrogen bonding between the AA units. For achieving elastomeric properties, nBA was chosen as a major component of the middle block
owing to its low Tg. The randomly incorporated
AA units were a minor component on the soft middle block and also
contributed to the change in the Tg of
the middle segment by hydrogen bonding. The effect of the incorporation
of AA units in the hard end domains had a demonstrable effect on the
thermal properties, as compared to their inclusion in the middle domain,
owing to more efficient pseudo-cross-linking.

and (c) poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA or 2EHA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) by RAFT Polymerization
Herein, we have described our strategies for the RAFT synthesis
of AA-containing styrene–acrylic triblock copolymer elastomers
under industrially applicable conditions, which are crucial for large-scale
production. The advantage of the triblock polymer is the feasibility
of optimization as a hot-melt PSA, as it can impart heat resistance
via pseudo-cross-linking by forming microphase separation structures
without using a cross-linking agent and aging. As cross-linking is
not necessary, the total number of the reaction steps can be reduced.
Additionally, the cohesive force of the triblock copolymers is higher,
and the molecular weight can be lowered as compared with general PSAs,
resulting in more solidification. A simpler process and high solid
contents are attractive for cost-effective industrial applications.
In this study, the heat resistance was controlled by introducing a
polar AA functional group into poly(St) end segments or poly(nBA) middle chain in the pristine triblock copolymers, poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St)s.
The location of the polar AA unit, composition, and chain lengths
of the segments were changed arbitrarily to evaluate the effects of
these parameters on the heat resistance and adhesive strength. In
addition to the inherent mechanical properties originating from the
low Tg of poly(nBA) and
glassy poly(St), the incorporation of the AA unit endowed these materials
with increased heat resistance and adhesive properties.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Triblock Copolymers
In this study, seven
block copolymers with arbitrarily changed positions of the polar functional
group and hard/soft blocks were prepared by introducing the AA unit
into the middle or end segments in poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) to control their heat resistance
and adhesive strength. The synthetic procedure is shown in Scheme 1. The choice of AA
was primarily related to the presence of the carboxylic acid group
in the triblock copolymers, which provided high Tg and expanded the applicability of the copolymers as
adhesives owing to its high hydrophilicity. The advantage of the ABA-type
triblock polymer is the feasibility to optimize various properties;
as a hot-melt PSA, the heat resistance can be improved by pseudo-cross-linking
of microphase separation structures. Eliminating the need for a cross-linking
agent is preferred in the industry as it decreases the number of steps
in production, for example, the aging process is no longer required.
The higher cohesive force enables the usage of lower molecular weight
polymers compared to general PSAs, which lead to an increase in the
solid content.

A bifunctional trithiocarbonate, dibenzyl trithiocarbonate,
was selected as a RAFT agent, which enabled the synthesis of ABA triblock
copolymers by simple two-stage polymerization. From the industrial
point of view, 2,2′-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) (ABN-E) was
used as a radical initiator instead of a conventional AIBN, in order
to avoid the formation of potentially toxic tetramethylsuccinonitrile
derived from AIBN as a byproduct. Ethyl acetate was chosen as the
solvent because of its intermediate polarity and good solubility of
all ingredients (three monomers, resulting copolymers, ABN-E, and
RAFT agent). For the first series of triblock copolymers, poly(St)
macro-CTA prepared using the bifunctional trithiocarbonate RAFT agent
was employed for the copolymerization of nBA with
AA, which allowed the incorporation of poly(nBA-ran-AA) as a middle block with poly(St) as hard segments
at both ends (Scheme 1b). As a comparison, poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) was prepared using the same poly(St)
macro-CTA (Scheme 1a). The polymerization results are summarized in Table 1. In all cases, polymerization
conditions were adjusted to afford the triblock copolymers with moderate
polydispersity index (PDIs) (Mw/Mn = 1.7–2.2), in order to provide excellent
wettability to a material to be bonded by increasing the adhesive
area, and to reduce the cost of manufacturing by improved productivity
at elevated polymerization temperatures. The polymerization at lower
temperatures using a relatively high [CTA]/[I] ratio can afford well-defined
triblock copolymers with lower PDIs, whereas a longer polymerization
time is required to achieve high monomer conversion, which is undesirable
for industrial production. When the RAFT copolymerization of nBA and AA was conducted using the poly(St) macro-CTA with
[nBA]0/[AA]0/[macro-CTA]0/[AIBN]0 = 1885/150/4/1 in ethyl acetate at 85
°C for 10 h, the block copolymers were obtained with moderate
monomer conversions (67 and 71% for nBA and AA, respectively,
BP4 in Table 1). The
triblock copolymer was obtained by reprecipitation into methanol,
followed by filtration. The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) chromatograms
of the starting poly(St) macro-CTA and triblock copolymers showed
unimodal SEC peaks with clear shift to higher molecular weight for
the triblock copolymer (Figure 2a), suggesting successful preparation of the targeted block
copolymers without the unfavorable unreacted homopolymer.

The formation of the AA-containing
triblock copolymer was further
confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy by comparison of the peaks
corresponding to each comonomer. To evaluate the AA unit, the poly(AA)
unit in the block copolymer was modified by methylation of the carboxylic
acid groups using trimethylsilyldiazomethane according to a slightly
modified literature method.44,451H NMR of
the triblock copolymer in CDCl3 clearly showed peaks corresponding
to methyl acrylate, which was derived from AA, in addition to St and nBA units (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The comonomer composition of the copolymers was calculated from
the conversion and feed ratios of both monomers, and the molecular
weight of macro-CTA was in reasonable agreement with the values calculated
from 1H NMR. Similarly, the formation of poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St)
was confirmed by SEC and 1H NMR analyses (Table 1, Figures 2b, and S1a, Supporting Information).

For the second series of the triblock copolymers,
poly(St-r-AA) macro-CTA was initially prepared by
the copolymerization
of St and AA using the bifunctional trithiocarbonate RAFT agent, followed
by RAFT polymerization of nBA (Scheme 1c). The poly(St-r-AA) macro-CTA
(Mn = 22,800, Mw/Mn = 1.36) was obtained by RAFT copolymerization
of St and AA at the feed ratio [St]0/[AA]0/[CTA]0/[AIBN]0 = 334/66/1/1 in ethyl acetate at 80 °C
for 12 h. It has been previously reported that in the radical copolymerization
of polar and nonpolar monomers, the solvent polarity affects the relative
monomer reactivity and copolymerization kinetics owing to the formation
of complexes between the monomer and/or the propagating radical and
the solvent, that is, the solvation of the transition state.46 In the case of St–AA copolymerization,
for example, the higher polarity of the solvent led to a greater difference
between the monomer reactivities, for example, rAA = 0.15 and rSt = 0.25 for the
copolymerization in bulk, rAA = 0.05–0.08
and rSt = 1.03–1.60 in N,N-dimethyl formamide, and rAA = 0.13 and rSt = 0.25 in
1,4-dioxane. Because nonpolar ethyl acetate was used as a solvent
in our case, the St/AA comonomer composition should be comparable
to that in the feed. Subsequent RAFT polymerization of nBA using the poly(St-r-AA) macro-CTA afforded triblock
copolymers with poly(nBA) and poly(St-r-AA) as the middle soft and hard segments, respectively. The comparison
of the SEC chromatograms of the starting macro-CTA and triblock copolymer
in Figure 2c shows
a clear shift to higher molecular weights for the block copolymer.
These results indicate the formation of the targeted ABA triblock
copolymers with predetermined chain lengths of the middle and end
blocks, composition, and location and amount of the carboxylic acid
functionality in the hard/soft segment, owing to the superior tolerance
of the carboxylic acid functionality during RAFT polymerization.

Morphology and Thermal Properties
The thermal properties
of the resulting triblock copolymers were analyzed by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). Three styrene–acrylic triblock
copolymers without (BP2 in Table 1) and with the AA unit in the middle soft segment (BP4
in Table 1) or end
hard segments (BP6 in Table 2) were employed as representative
samples. As shown in Figure 3, DSC measurements showed that the addition of the AA units
into the middle poly(BA) units increased the Tg of the midblock, relative to that of the pristine triblock
copolymer (Tg of the midblock changed
from −37.1 to −32.6 °C for BP2 and BP4, respectively).
In contrast, the incorporation of AA units in poly(St) end blocks
of the triblock copolymers (BP6 in Table 2) exhibited no significant change in Tg, which was attributed to the middle soft segment.

The
atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and adhesive images of
the surface of the three block copolymers were recorded under ambient
conditions on a 1.5 × 1.5 μm2 scale to investigate
the phase separation between the hard and soft domains (Figure 4). In addition to the conventional
height images, the PeakForce QNM technique gave further insights into
the state of the adhesive properties. The bright and dark regions
in the adhesive images were assigned to the soft poly(nBA) and hard poly(St) segments, respectively. AFM measurements of
poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) (BP2) with longer poly(St) segments (Mn = 15,900) revealed spherical microphase separated structures,
as shown in Figure 4a. In contrast, the same triblock copolymer (BP1) with relatively
short poly(St) segments (Mn = 10,000)
showed no microphase separation (Figure S2, Supporting Information), suggesting that a certain chain length of poly(St)
hard segment was required to achieve microphase separation under the
conditions. As shown in Figures 4b,c, both spherical and cylindrical structures could
be observed for poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St) (BP4) and poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) (BP6). These results indicated
that the addition of AA units to poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) led to a change in the
Flory–Huggins interaction parameters between poly(St) and poly(nBA), resulting in a self-assembled morphology. The same
shapes and distributions were seen in the height images (Figure 4d–f), which
provided further evidence for the presence of microphase separation
structures. As shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St) (BP5 in Table 1) and poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) (BP7 in Table 2) with their longer middle soft
segments exhibited spherical structures originating from a short hard
segment, which were dispersed within the matrix of the soft segment.
In the case of poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(2-EHA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) (BP8 in Table 2), continuous cylindrical structures
were predominantly visible (Figure S4, Supporting Information). These AFM investigations indicated the formation
of self-assembled structures on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
substrate, in which the morphologies were governed by the chain lengths
of the soft and hard segments, their composition, location of the
AA unit, and flexibility of the middle soft segment.

Evaluation of Adhesive
Properties
The adhesive properties
and melt temperature of the synthesized triblock copolymers were evaluated
in terms of 180° peeling adhesive strength and holding force,
shear adhesion failure temperature (SAFT), dynamic viscoelasticity
measurement [dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)], and a Koka-type flow
tester. The adhesive strength was initially evaluated by a 180°
peel test, which corresponds to the force required to peel the adhesive
from an adherend. Here, the holding force was evaluated by monitoring
the temperature before the adhesive failed. In both cases, a flexible
backing film was adhesively bonded to stainless steel. The SAFT determines
the upper working limit temperature of a tape under static shear load.
In the SAFT test, the heat-fail temperature of shear strength of a
PSA was measured as an additional test for shear resistance. For practical
applications, it is desirable to produce triblock copolymers with
a holding force greater than 100 °C that stabilizes the adhesive
film without any position displacement, adhesion strength higher than
20 N/25 mm, SAFT > 100 °C, and no cohesive failure.

Initially,
we attempted to prepare the heat-resistant ABA triblock copolymers
with a high holding power even under a high-temperature environment
by changing the molecular weight of poly(St) hard segments in poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St)s.
As shown in Table 3, poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) with relatively short poly(St) end chains (Mn = 10,000, BP1) exhibited low cohesive strength,
and cohesive failure was detected in a 180° peeling adhesion
strength test. Further, the melting temperature, which was defined
as a softening point by a 1/2 method (T1/2), was determined to be less than 40 °C using a Koka-type flow
tester (Figure 5).
The ball tack test was also conducted to evaluate the tackiness of
adhesive tape, and the result showed a similar tendency (the number
of ball, which could be stuck to the adhesive tape, was 12).

composed of the poly(nBA) middle block and longer
poly(St) chains (Mn = 15,900, BP2 and
BP3). In a 180° peeling adhesion strength test, the delamination
was interfacial failure, no stick-slip was detected, and the adhesive
strength was observed to be 20 N/25 mm or less. However, the heat
creep resistance test (1 kgf at 80 °C for 2 h) revealed a short
holding time of 1 min, suggesting insufficient heat resistance. The
same tendency was also observed in the ball tack test (ball number
= 12).

block, poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St), and relatively longer
poly(St) end chains (Mn = 15,900, BP4
and BP5) exhibited good adhesive
strength (>20 N/25 mm), interfacial failure, no stick-slip, and
higher
melting temperature (T1/2 = 110 °C).
Because higher ball number corresponds to lower tackiness, the results
of the ball tack test indicated higher tackiness (11 for BP4 and 10
for BP5, respectively) of the triblock copolymers with the AA unit
in the middle block and relatively longer poly(St) end chains.

As shown in Table 3, the SAFT of BP5 is much lower than that of BP4, which may be due
to the higher St content in BP4. As can be seen in AFM images, BP4
showed predominantly cylindrical structures (Figure 4b,e), whereas spherical structure was mainly
detected in BP5 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Similarly, higher SAFT of BP8 is caused by the cylindrical structures
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). The
difference in the nanomorphology may contribute to the significant
difference in the SAFT between BP4 and BP5, in addition to the different
St contents. In contrast, higher SAFT of BP6 may be due to the incorporation
of the AA unit, which can contribute to the self-complementary hydrogen
bonding, into poly(St) segments, resulting in the enhancement of pseudo-cross-linking.
In this case, both cylindrical and spherical structures were clearly
seen in the AFM images (Figure 4c,f), which can be attributed to high SAFT of BP6. In order
to evaluate the surface composition, we also conducted contact angle
measurements of a water droplet on the block copolymer surfaces. The
contact angle of the block copolymers with AA units in the poly(St)
segments (BP6 and BP7) were 100 and 107°, respectively. These
values were comparable to those of the block copolymers without AA
units (103 and 107° for BP2 and BP3), indicating that the outermost
surface was covered predominantly with the hydrophobic St unit, independent
of the AA contents. Poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) with relatively longer poly(St-r-AA) end chains
(Mn = 22,800, BP6 and BP7) exhibited good
adhesive strength (>20 N/25 mm), interfacial failure, and no stick-slip.
The result of the ball tack test was 12 (BP6) and 14 (BP7), respectively.

The triblock copolymers with the AA unit in the end blocks, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA)s (BP6 and BP7), showed
further increase in the melting temperature (130 °C) and no deviation
under the measurement conditions. This result implied that good heat
resistance was achieved by incorporating the AA unit in the poly(St)
end chains. The results of the Koka-type flow tester, as shown in Figure 5, confirmed that
both the increase in the melting temperature and heat resistance were
dependent on the position of the introduced AA unit. Thus, by using
the triblock copolymers with suitable AA units in the hard segments,
the adhesiveness of the adhesive layer was enhanced, and the occurrence
of the positional deviation between the substrate and flexible film
was suppressed.

Figure 6 shows the
results of DMA, giving an insight into the temperature dependence
of the storage modulus (G′) and loss (G′′) of the triblock copolymer. The triblock
copolymer poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) was first measured as a reference. In Figure 6a, for the copolymer
where the AA unit was not installed, the storage elastic modulus decreased
markedly for temperatures above 60 °C. In Figure 6b,c, the decrease in the storage modulus
at high temperatures was suppressed by the introduction of AA units
at specific locations. Figure 7 shows a plot of the storage modulus data for each sample.
Comparing BP4 and BP6, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA)s (triblock polymer with AA units in the end block, BP6) showed
a lower storage modulus at higher temperatures than BP4. BP6 showed
no deviation in the 120 °C holding power test. The melting temperature
of the poly(St) hard segment that acted as a pseudo-cross-linking
point was the main factor that determined the heat resistance temperature
of the triblock polymer. In addition to the thermal stability of the
original poly(St) segment, the hydrogen bonding strength between the
AA units helped to further strengthen the network of the cross-linking
points and improve heat resistance. Owing to the introduction of polar
functional groups and optimization of the AA position, an elastomer
with excellent heat resistance was obtained while still being a thermoplastic.
BP8 with 2-EHA introduced in the soft segment showed excellent holding
power like BP7, and Tg of the soft segment
had no effect on heat resistance. The adhesive strength (180°
peeling strength) was less than 1/40 compared with BA and did not
increase because of strong adhesiveness.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated
that incorporation of an AA unit
in ABA triblock copolymers composed of poly(St) hard ends and poly(nBA) soft middle block leads to a novel PSA with thermoplastic
property, good heat resistance, and strong tackiness. Poly(St) and
poly(St-r-AA) end blocks were initially prepared
as macro-CTAs, and subsequent chain extension via RAFT process afforded
poly(nBA-r-AA) and poly(nBA) middle blocks, ultimately resulting in the formation
of the target triblock copolymers. Poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) exhibited excellent adhesion properties and heat resistance
in terms of a higher holding force at 120 °C, adhesion strength
= 24.0 N/25 mm, SAFT = 103 °C, and no cohesive failure. The presence
of free carboxylic acid groups increased the intermolecular interactions
within the glassy poly(St) end blocks and promoted stronger pseudo-cross-links
that ultimately improved the heat resistance and adhesive strength.
Although similar peel adhesion and no cohesive failure were observed
for poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St), in the heat creep resistance,
the creep distance was 2.5 mm, and SAFT was 84 °C.

These
results suggested that the hydrogen bonds between the AA
units on the middle block served as dynamic stickers in the elastic
strands of these elastomers under the applied conditions. Regardless
of the location of the AA units, the triblock copolymers with incorporated
functional carboxylic acids exhibited better heat resistance and adhesive
strength than the pristine St-nBA-based triblock
copolymer elastomers. Significant improvements in the adhesion and
heat resistance properties of these triblock copolymers as a result
of such noncovalent interactions allowed for an improved design of
high-performance thermoplastic elastomers. In other words, this study
demonstrates the enhancement effect of the noncovalent interactions,
self-complementary hydrogen bonding, and chain lengths of the hard/soft
blocks, on the adhesion and heat resistance properties of the elastomers.

>99%), ethyl acetate (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, >99%),
and S,S-dibenzyl trithiocarbonate
(CTA, Arkema,

Synthesis of Poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St)
The
triblock copolymer having poly(nBA-r-AA) as the midblock was synthesized as follows (BP4 in Table 1). St (100 g, 0.962
mol), CTA (0.697 g, 2.40 mmol), ABN-E (0.462 g, 2.40 mmol), and ethyl
acetate (50 mL) were placed in a Schlenk reaction flask, and the solution
was purged with nitrogen for 60 min at a flow rate of 200 mL/min.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. Subsequently,
conversion of St was calculated by gas chromatography (GC) to be 68%.
The crude product was purified by reprecipitation into methanol, followed
by filtration to afford poly(St) as a pale yellow solid (yield = 64%).
The number-average molecular weight (Mn) (as determined by SEC) and PDI (Mw/Mn) of the prepared poly(St) were 15,900 and
1.25, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information).

For the preparation of the block copolymer, trithiocarbonate-terminated
poly(St) (50.0 g, 3.14 mmol), ABN-E (151 mg, 0.785 mmol), nBA (190 g, 1.48 mol), AA (8.50 g, 0.118 mol), and ethyl
acetate (120 mL) were placed in a Schlenk flask, and the solution
was purged with nitrogen for 60 min at a flow rate of 200 mL/min.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 85 °C for 10 h. The conversions
of nBA and AA, as determined by GC, were 67 and 71%,
respectively. The crude product was purified by reprecipitation into
methanol and filtration afforded poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St) as
a pale yellow solid (yield = 65%). The Mn,SEC and PDI of the block copolymer were 46,000 and 1.76, respectively.

Synthesis of Poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St)
Synthesis of the triblock
copolymer to be used as a standard sample was performed as follows
(BP2 in Table 1). The
trithiocarbonate-terminated poly(St) macro-CTA (Mn = 15,900, Mw/Mn = 1.25) synthesized by the method described above was
employed. For the preparation of the block copolymer, trithiocarbonate-terminated
poly(St) (50.0 g, 3.14 mmol), ABN-E (151 mg, 0.786 mmol), nBA (181 g, 1.42 mol), and ethyl acetate (110 mL) were placed
in a Schlenk flask, and the solution was purged with nitrogen for
60 min at a flow rate of 200 mL/min. The reaction mixture was stirred
at 85 °C for 10 h and the conversion, as determined by GC, was
75%. The crude product was purified by reprecipitation into methanol
and filtration-afforded poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St) as a pale yellow solid (yield = 71%).
The Mn,SEC and PDI of the block copolymer
were 43,100 and 1.79, respectively.

Synthesis of Poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA)
The triblock copolymer
having poly(St-r-AA) end blocks was synthesized as
follows (BP6 in Table 2). St (88.0 g, 0.846 mol), AA
(12.0 g, 0.166 mol), CTA (0.734 g, 2.53 mmol), ABN-E (0.486 g, 2.53
mmol), and ethyl acetate (50 mL) were placed in a Schlenk flask, and
the solution was purged with nitrogen for 60 min at a flow rate of
200 mL/min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12
h. Subsequently, the conversions of St and AA were determined by GC
to be 86 and 99%, respectively. The crude product was purified by
reprecipitation into methanol, followed by filtration to afford poly(St-r-AA) as a yellow solid (yield = 85%). The resulting poly(St-r-AA) had Mn (as determined
by SEC) and PDI of 22,800 and 1.36, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information).

For the synthesis
of the block copolymer, the trithiocarbonate-terminated poly(St-r-AA) (50.0 g, 2.19 mmol), ABN-E (84.1 mg, 0.438 mmol), nBA (196 g, 1.53 mol), and ethyl acetate (120 mL) were placed
in a Schlenk flask, and the solution was purged with nitrogen for
60 min at a flow rate of 200 mL/min. The reaction mixture was stirred
at 85 °C for 10 h. The conversion (based on nBA) calculated by GC was 73%. The crude product was purified by reprecipitation
into methanol, followed by filtration to obtain poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA) as a pale yellow solid (yield = 67%).
The Mn,SEC and PDI of the block copolymer
were 53,700 and 1.94, respectively.

Instrumentation
Mn and Mw/Mn were estimated
by SEC at 40 °C, using a SHODEX GPC-101 system equipped with
refractive index and UV detectors. The column set consisted of four
consecutive hydrophilic vinyl polymer-based gel columns (TSK-GELs,
bead size, exclusion limits): GMHXL (9 μm, 4 × 108), G-2000 (5 μm, 1 × 104), and a guard column
(TSK-guard column HXL-L, 4.0 cm). The system was operated at a flow
rate of 1.0 mL/min using tetrahydrofuran (THF). Polystyrene standards
were used for calibration. The residual monomer content was measured
by GC (Agilent GC7890) using the HP-5 (5% phenyl methyl-polysiloxane)
column and a flame ionization detector. The system was operated at
a carrier gas flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.

AFM experiments were
performed with the Bruker MultiMode 8 microscope by the PeakForce
QNM technique in air, using silicon nitride cantilevers with a force
constant of approximately 0.4 N/m. The sample was prepared as follows.
The block copolymer solution was diluted to 40% with ethyl acetate,
applied to a PET film (Lumirror #50 - S10 Toray Industries, Inc.)
using a Baker film applicator (150 μm gap and 25 μm film
thickness), and dried at 100 °C for 5 min.

Measurements
of peel strength were all made on a tensile testing
machine (Toyoseiki Strograph VG1-E) using a modified form of a variable-angle
peeling device, following a standard Japanese Industrial Standards
(JIS) procedure (JISZ0237:2009). The stainless steel substrate was
cleaned with acetone. The specimen was cut to a width of 24 mm and
a length of 300 mm using an adhesive tape test piece made by the above-mentioned
preparation method. The specimen was a SUS304 steel plate with bright
annealed finish and surface roughness of Ra 50 ± 25 nm. The dimensions of the test plate were 2 mm (thickness)
× 50 mm (width) × 125 mm (length). The test plate was cleaned
by soaking absorbent cotton in acetone and wiping the surface of the
specimen and then drying by wiping with new cotton wool. This cleaning
procedure was repeated three times or more, until the washing solvent
was visually removed from the surface of the substrate. Then, the
block copolymer specimen was pressed onto the stainless steel substrate
using two passes of a 2 kg rubber roller and stored at room temperature
for over 24 h. The 180 peel strength of the specimens was measured
after coating onto the PET film. The crosshead speed was 300 mm/min
at room temperature. The average force in the debonding process was
measured as the peel strength.

The SAFT indicates the resistive
ability under a constant shear
load at an elevated temperature and can be measured following a standard
JIS procedure (ASTMD-4498). The specimen was pressed onto a stainless
steel substrate using two passes of a 2 kg rubber roller and was 24
mm wide and 10 mm long. The load attached to the specimen was 1 kg,
and the heating rate was 0.5 °C/min. The SAFT results indicated
the temperature at which the bonding failed.

Heat creep resistance
was measured using a creep tester (Tester
Industries), according to a standard JIS procedure (JISZ0237:2009).
The test piece prepared by the method described above was cut into
a 25 mm wide and 300 mm long test piece, which was placed at the center
of a 25 mm × 25 mm stainless steel plate without applying pressure.
The roller was pressed four times from above the test piece. At 24
h after crimping, one end of the stainless steel plate was stopped
such that the stainless steel plate and the test piece were vertical,
and a 1 kg weight could be attached. The test piece was then placed
in an oven adjusted to a temperature of 80 °C, and the time elapsed
until the test piece completely peeled off the stainless steel plate
after 2 h from the attachment of the weight, or the shifted distance
after a predetermined time, was measured.

Inclined ball tack
was measured using a ball tack tester (Tester
Industries), according to a standard JIS procedure (JISZ0237:2009).
The test piece prepared by the method described above was cut into
a 15 mm wide and 300 mm long test piece and was set on an inclined
surface of the tack tester. The inclination angle of the inclined
ball tack tester was 30°. After washing the ball with acetone
using high-carbon chromium bearing steel (SUJ2), the ball was rolled
from the inclined surface and evaluated whether it stopped on the
adhesive surface. The ball number shall be 32 for a 1 inch diameter
and 1 for 1/32. The test results were expressed as the number of the
largest ball found, and the average of three test pieces was determined.

The dynamic viscoelasticity measurements (DMA) were performed using
ARES-G2 (TA Instruments) at 1 Hz and −50 to 150 °C with
the temperature increasing at a rate of 3 °C/min. The outflow
temperature by the 1/2 method using a Koka-type flow tester was measured
using a rising flow tester (Shimadzu Corporation). The die diameter
was 1 mm, cylinder pressure was 0.98 MPa, heating rate was 4 °C/min,
and the measurement started at 40 °C.
