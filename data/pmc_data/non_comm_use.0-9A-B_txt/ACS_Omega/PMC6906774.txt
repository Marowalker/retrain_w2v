The grafting of molecular monolayers is critical for
the functionalization
of surfaces. In molecular electrochemistry, the surface modification
of electrodes and the way molecules are attached to the electrode
surface are highly critical to electron transfers and electrochemical
reactions. In this paper, sub-monolayers were covalently grafted onto
glassy carbon (GC) electrodes via Diels–Alder cycloaddition
with two soluble dienophiles, that is, propargyl bromide and ethynyl
ferrocene. Such an approach is clean (no by-product, no catalyst/additive)
and occurs under mild conditions by heating at 50 °C in toluene
for few hours. The as-modified electrodes were thoroughly characterized
by FTIR, XPS, and cyclic voltammetry using both millimetric GC electrodes
and ultra-microelectrodes. Cyclic voltammetry gave access to surface
coverage and clearly evidenced the covalent grafting of sub-monolayers.
The grafting of functional sub-monolayers via Diels–Alder cycloaddition
could be easily extended to various functionalities and carbons to
prepare electrochemical sensors or electrocatalytic surfaces.

Introduction
Surfaces are critical in a wide range
of applications1 including catalysis, tribology,
sensing, adsorption,
corrosion, and electrochemistry as long as solid/gas or solid/liquid
interfaces are involved. The fine control of both surfaces’
composition and roughness has been a key lever to tune the physicochemical
properties of both flat and porous substrates. In molecular electrochemistry,
the surface modification of electrodes and the way molecules are attached
to the electrode surface are highly critical to electron transfers
and electrochemical reactions.2−4 Among substrates commonly employed
in electrochemistry, gold and carbon-based electrodes5 have been the most popular and various grafting methods
have been developed accordingly. As for carbon, the diversity of allotropes,
for example, diamond, graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
carbon black, and glassy carbons, and chemical purity led to various
strategies to functionalize surfaces at the molecular level. Among
sp2 hybridized carbons, which are of particular interest
as long as electrical conductivity is required, the aryl diazonium
salt approach6 has been widely used, particularly
for the functionalization of CNTs7,8 and ordered
mesoporous carbons.9,10 The grafting of aryl diazonium
salts can be performed through electrochemically induced reduction7,11 or spontaneous chemically/thermally induced reactions.8,9,12−14 Interestingly,
Bahr and Tour8 first reported the in situ
generation of diazonium salts and subsequent grafting on carbon nanotubes.
As claimed by the authors, such an approach avoids the necessity of
isolating and storing (often) unstable and light-sensitive aryl diazonium
salts. Moreover, as compared with other methods developed for covalent
functionalization of carbon materials, involving, beforehand, oxidation
with nitric acid, oxygen, or ozone to generate oxygenated functionalities,15 the in situ generated diazonium salt approach
is a single-step and straightforward process avoiding drastic damage
usually caused by oxidative treatments.

Thus, the diazonium
salt approach has offered a range of synthetic
opportunities to functionalize carbon surfaces. As an example, Palacin
et al.16,17 developed the so-called Graft fast process
allowing the covalent grafting of polymer films via the chemical reduction
of aryl diazonium salts and subsequent initiation of the radical polymerization
of vinylic monomers. Limoges et al.18 proposed
to use the electrochemical reduction of phenylazide or phenylacetylene
diazonium salts on glassy carbon electrodes as a versatile platform
for click chemistry. On the one hand, these two elegant methods revealed,
if still needed, the great versatility and potential of the diazonium
salt approach. On the other hand, the reduction of diazonium salts
usually leads to the formation of multilayered films, even though
Toupin and Bélanger14 suggested
a spontaneous self-limited monolayer grafting in the absence of electrochemical
driving forces. Nevertheless, this so-called self-limited grafting
seems to be more kinetic than thermodynamic. Another main drawback
might rely on the use of additives, for example, sodium nitrite and
sulfuric acid, especially for the in situ generation and/or chemically
induced reduction of diazonium salts.

As an alternative two
groups proposed, in 2004, the direct functionalization
of single-walled CNTs via cycloaddition reactions. Langa et al.19 reported the Diels–Alder (DA) cycloaddition
of o-quinodimethane under microwave irradiation,
while Cosnier et al.20 grafted ferrocene
through the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethyne ylides. More recently,
Abetz et al.21 demonstrated the dual nature
of the reactivity of carbon materials in DA cycloadditions. Depending
on the nature of the soluble reactants, that is, furan or maleimide
derivatives, CNTs could behave either as dienes or as dienophiles.
Interestingly, this dual reactivity of carbon materials could offer
a fine control over the surface chemistry, that is, self-limited monolayer
versus polymeric film. Thus, consecutive DA cycloadditions of dienes,
as dienophilic sites were autogenerated on the carbon surface while
the DA reaction occurred, could be performed on carbon nanofibers.22 One may assume that such a multilayered polymerization
is not possible when grafting soluble dienophiles on carbon surfaces.

Taking the “surface DA” functionalization one step
further, Goettmann et al.23 extended this
approach to various templated porous carbons acting as diene providers
and soluble dienophiles such as propargylamine. In the same year,
Urakami et al.24 took advantage of the
polyfuran structure of biosourced hydrothermal carbons to graft various
dienophiles such as maleimide. These two recent studies, together
with the previous works, demonstrated clearly the versatility of this
approach and implemented a powerful methodology to obtain functional
porous carbon-based materials. Last but not the least, the DA cycloaddition
reaction is advantageous as it does not generate any by-product, does
not require any catalyst or additive, and can be performed under mild
conditions and in solvent-free media.21

However, unlike the diazonium salt approach, the DA cycloaddition
reaction has been sporadically reported for the covalent functionalization
of carbon electrodes. Taking advantage of this rather simple approach,
we propose herein the self-limited monolayer grafting of both non-electroactive
and electroactive (i.e., ferrocene) alkyne derivatives onto glassy
carbon electrodes. To the best of our knowledge, no thorough electrochemical
study has ever been reported on monolayers grafted via DA cycloaddition.
The aim of this work is to give an in-depth insight into such monolayers
(or sub-monolayers) through the prism of electrochemistry.

Results and Discussion
Grafting Method
As mentioned previously, the surface
of sp2 hybridized carbons can act as diene providers, reacting
potentially with soluble dienophiles such as alkyne groups via the
Diels–Alder reaction (Scheme 1). Drawing our inspiration from Goettmann et al.23 and Urakami et al.,24 we propose to extend this approach to glassy carbon electrodes using
two soluble dienophiles: propargyl bromide and ethynyl ferrocene.
While ethynyl ferrocene is electroactive and its covalent grafting
can be directly followed through cyclic voltammetry, propargyl bromide
is not and requires the use of a soluble redox probe, as it will be
discussed later. The different electrodes prepared in this study are
summarized in Table 1.

The double arrow suggests that the retro-Diels–Alder reaction
should be considered. However, no retro-Diels–Alder reaction
was observed at 50 °C.

The DA cycloaddition reaction does not generate any
by-product,
does not require any catalyst or additive, and can be performed under
mild conditions. Herein, we proceeded at 50 °C immersing a glassy
carbon electrode within 1 × 10–2 M solution
of alkyne derivatives in toluene. Assuming that carbon surfaces are
rather heterogeneous, one may suppose that both open and cyclic dienes
are present and readily accessible to potentially react with the alkyne
group. If the diene is already cyclic, which is most probably the
case at the surface of glassy carbon electrodes (Scheme 1), the DA reaction will produce
a bicyclic system. After the DA reaction took place, no diene remains
(Scheme 1), avoiding
any multilayered polymerization as usually observed via the diazonium
approach. As a direct consequence, DA reactions should allow for a
self-limited grafting of functional monolayers.

In order to
evidence the effective surface modification of the
electrodes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Table S1 and Figure S1), contact angle measurements (Figure S2), Raman spectroscopy (Figure S3), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
were realized on millimetric glassy carbon substrates (Figure 1). As for XPS, about 0.05 at.
% Br and 0.33 at. % Fe were detected for Macro-Br and Macro-Fc substrates,
respectively (Table S1). The XPS Fe 2p
spectrum obtained from Macro-Fc (Figure S1) displays two couples of intense peaks corresponding to divalent
iron species (at binding energies of 708 and 721 eV) and to trivalent
ones (at binding energies of 712 and 725 eV), as described previously
in the literature for grafted ferrocene derivatives.25 As XPS gives the relative chemical composition of surfaces
at a depth of about 1–10 nm, these values are clearly rather
low, especially as we expect self-limited monolayers. XPS data can
only be used to support the efficient surface modification of the
electrodes but cannot be employed to quantify any surface coverage.
This point will be discussed later via electrochemical methods. Contact
angle measurements were also performed with water onto millimetric
GC substrates as a qualitative way to demonstrate the efficient grafting
of functional layers (Figure S2). Macro-bare
and Macro-Br electrodes show similar wetting properties with contact
angles in the range of 75–78°, slightly lower than graphite.26 After treatment with ethynyl ferrocene, a slight
increase was noticed with a contact angle of about 88°, which
could support the effective coverage of the GC surface with hydrophobic
ferrocene moieties. FTIR grazing angle measurement (Figure 1) and Raman spectroscopy (Figure S3) were also performed on Macro-bare,
Macro-Br, and Macro-Fc glassy carbon substrates. On the one hand,
Raman spectra highlight different features before and after grafting
(Supporting Information). While both G
and D bands (at 1580 and 1360 cm–1, respectively),
typical of carbon materials, are clearly observed for the Macro-bare
electrode, these bands are hidden by a strong fluorescence after DA
cycloaddition (for both Macro-Br and Macro-Fc substrates). Even though
the cause of such fluorescence is still subject to discussion, one
may assume that the presence of freshly formed unsaturated bicyclic
compounds onto the GC surface (Scheme 1) could be responsible for such a feature. On the other
hand, grazing angle FTIR spectroscopy showed clear bands for both
Macro-Br and Macro-Fc substrates (Figure 1). The bands associated with ferrocene groups
are clearly identifiable in Figure 1 (red curve, in the middle): the band at 476 cm–1 corresponds to Fe-Cp stretching modes,
while the ones centered at 1000 and 3014 cm–1 correspond
to sp2 C–H in-plane bending modes and stretching
modes, respectively, and the band at 1407 cm–1 corresponds
to C–C stretching modes. The lower green curve in Figure 1 shows that we succeeded
in grafting propargyl bromide groups. Apart from the band at 1078
cm–1 corresponding to sp2 C–H
in-plane bending modes, a broad band corresponding to C–Br
stretching modes at 685 cm–1 can be observed.

Figure 1 Fourier transformed
infrared spectra obtained for Macro-bare electrode
(upper black curve), grafted propargyl Br electrode Macro-Br (lower
green curve), and grafted ethynyl Fc electrode Macro-Fc (red curve,
in the middle).

Besides physicochemical characterizations, a thorough
electrochemical
study was conducted. Unlike ethynyl ferrocene, which is electroactive
and can be directly followed through cyclic voltammetry, propargyl
bromide is not and the electrochemical study of its covalent grafting
requires the use of a soluble redox probe, as it will be discussed
later.

Grafting of Non-electroactive Molecules
Cyclic voltammetry
was performed before and after different DA reaction durations (0.5,
2, and 24 h) as described earlier in the Experimental
Section. Ferri/ferrocyanide was used in aqueous media (in 0.5
M KCl) as a redox probe to evidence surface modification. Figure 2 presents cyclic
voltammograms (CVs) recorded in ferri/ferrocyanide aqueous solution
at four scan rates: 50, 100, 500, and 1000 mV s–1. In each case, we recorded three voltammograms: one using a bare
electrode (Macro-bare; black curve) and two others using Macro-Br
electrodes (modified with propargyl bromide) after different reaction
times, that is, 2 h (red curve) and 24 h (dashed red curve). For each
scan rate, voltammograms recorded for the Macro-bare electrode clearly
show two peaks corresponding to the oxidation and reduction of the
electrochemical probe, that is, ferri/ferrocyanide. After 2 h of Diels–Alder
grafting, the corresponding voltammograms display a decrease in the
intensity of both peaks. While increasing the reaction time to 24
h, both peaks nearly disappeared and the potential difference between
the anodic and cathodic peaks (ΔEp) increased, indicating that the surface of the electrode is blocked.
This feature is probably due to the efficient grafting of a monolayer
of non-electroactive molecules, that is, propargyl bromide, which
acts as a barrier to redox processes.

diameter glassy carbon

different surface conditions. Bare glassy carbon electrode (black),
Macro-Br after 2 h of reaction (red), and Macro-Br after 24 h of reaction

These results confirm the effective grafting of
propargyl bromide
molecules via the Diels–Alder reaction and suggest the formation
of a close-packed insulating layer onto the glassy carbon electrodes.
The quantification of surface coverage was investigated using the
“partially blocked electrodes” model given by Amatore
et al. in 1983.27 Two complementary calculations
give an estimation of the surface coverage named θ. The first
one comes from the ratio of peak currents (eq 1), and the second one involves the ratio of
apparent kinetic constants (eq 2). 1   2  where imodifp and ibarep are peak currents for modified and bare electrodes, respectively,
and kapp0 and k0 are kinetic constants
for modified and bare electrodes, respectively, calculated using Nicholson
and Chain’s method. Using eqs 1 and 2, an estimation of the
coverage is given and resumed in Table 2.

In regard to the differences in surface coverage values
obtained
as a function of the equation used (Table 2), it is clear that mass and electron transports
at modified interfaces are more complex than a simple linear diffusion.
In fact, Amatore et al.27 followed by many
publications28−30 showed the combination of linear versus radial diffusion
on partially blocked surfaces as a function of the scan rate. Thus, eq 1 is exact only if linear
diffusion is considered. Beyond the accuracy of these surface coverage
values, electrochemical estimations support the grafting of a sub-monolayer.

Our surface modification can be transposed to ultra-microelectrodes. Figure 3 shows cyclic voltammetry
responses as a function of reaction times onto ultra-microelectrodes.
The electrode passivation suggests the formation of insulating layers
onto electrode surfaces.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammetry recorded at ultra-microelectrodes
for ferrocyanide
(2 × 10–3 M) oxidation, in water containing
0.5 M KCl as the electrolyte and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode,
at different scan rates of (A) 50 and (B) 100 mV s–1. Different electrodes were studied: bare glassy carbon
electrode (black), Macro-Br after 2 h of reaction (red), and Macro-Br
after 24 h of reaction (dashed red).

As a partial conclusion, the proof of concept regarding
the grafting
of self-limited functional monolayers on glassy carbon electrodes
by Diels–Alder reactions has been demonstrated. To further
show the versatility of this approach, redox-active dienophile molecules,
that is, ethynyl ferrocene, were also grafted on glassy carbon electrodes
as mentioned earlier.

Grafting of Electroactive Molecules
The grafting of
ethynyl ferrocene was performed employing the same experimental procedure
as for propargyl bromide (see the Experimental Ssection). Cyclic voltammetry (Figure 4) was carried out before and after grafting at different Diels–Alder
reaction times (0.5, 2, and 24 h). Unlike previously, no soluble redox
probe was used to evidence electrode passivation. As ferrocene is
a redox probe, electrochemistry allows demonstrating effective DA
grafting through recording the electrochemical response of the grafted
molecules themselves. Figure 4A shows four cyclic voltammograms. The black curve corresponds
to a bare electrode (Macro-bare). We can clearly see a capacitive
shape without any redox peak. On the contrary, the three cyclic voltammograms
recorded for Macro-Fc electrodes after 0.5, 2, and 24 h of DA grafting
(blue, green, and red curves, respectively) show two redox peaks.
Both green (after 0.5 h) and blue curves (after 2 h) are nearly superimposed
with weakly intense peaks. After 24 h of DA grafting (Figure 4A; red curve), two well-defined
and more intense peaks appear, corresponding to the oxido-reduction
reactions of ferrocene. By increasing the scan rate, the current intensities
of both oxidation and reduction peaks increase (Figure 4C). Both peaks clearly exhibit a Gaussian-like
shape typical of a thin layer response. Drawing the current intensity
of the oxidation peak as a function of the scan rate gave a quasi-linear
trend line (Figure 4D), supporting the presence of a thin layer and no-diffusive effect
of ferrocene (Figure 4D). The integral of the peak gives direct access to surface coverage
of ferrocene using the Faradaic equation. The estimated surface density
is of 2.4 × 10–10 mol cm–2 after 30 min of grafting, supporting the grafting of a sub-monolayer.
After 24 h of reaction, the estimated surface density reaches the
maximum surface density estimated for a monolayer of ferrocene, ∼4.5
× 10–10 mol cm–2 assuming
a hexagonal close packing.31,32 To make sure that the
electrochemical response was due to purely DA covalent grafting, a
blank experiment was performed using pure ferrocene instead of ethynyl
ferrocene. The cyclic voltammograms obtained with the as-prepared
electrode are shown in Figure 4B. Whatever the scan rate, no redox peak can be observed.
This result clearly supports that the grafting of ferrocene occurred
via DA reactions of ethynyl groups onto the carbon surface. In other
ways, no physical adsorption was responsible for the characteristic
electrochemical response of ferrocene, highlighting the efficiency
of our approach.

Conclusions
Two alkyne derivatives were grafted onto
the glassy carbon (GC)
electrodes using the Diels–Alder (DA) cycloaddition reaction.
The as-modified electrodes were thoroughly characterized by spectroscopy
techniques (XPS and FTIR), while cyclic voltammetry gave access to
surface coverage and clearly evidenced the covalent grafting of molecular
layers. Interestingly, we could give an in-depth insight into the
as-generated sub-monolayers through the prism of electrochemistry.
Both non-electroactive (i.e., propargyl bromide) and electroactive
(i.e., ethynyl ferrocene) derivatives were successfully grafted, demonstrating
the formation of either a close-packed insulating layer or a redox-active
sub-monolayer.

Overall, we believe that this work further underpins
the great
potential of the DA cycloaddition reaction as a clean, powerful, and
simple methodology to functionalize carbon electrodes. This reaction
is advantageous as it does not generate any by-product, does not require
any catalyst or additive, and can be performed under mild conditions,
that is, 50 °C in toluene for few hours. Finally yet importantly,
such versatile methodology could be easily extended to various functionalities
and substrates to prepare electrochemical sensors or electrocatalytic
surfaces.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Propargyl bromide and ethynyl ferrocene were
purchased from Aldrich. Most salts were ACS reagent grade, were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and used without further purification.

Surface Modification
Before modification, the glassy
carbon electrodes were cleaned and mechanically polished with successively
finer grades of alumina powder down to 0.05 μm. Surfaces were
then sonicated in a water and acetone mixture to remove the polishing
debris. Millimetric glassy carbon electrodes (3.0 mm diameter) or
ultra-microelectrodes (10 μm diameter) were immersed in 1 ×
10–2 mol L–1 propargyl bromide
or ethynyl ferrocene in a toluene solution at 50 °C for 0.5,
2, or 24 h. The as-modified electrodes were rinsed with toluene, dried,
and rinsed with pure water before being immediately transferred into
the electrochemical cell for cyclic voltammetry experiments.

Characterization
The samples were characterized by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCALAB 250 Thermo Electron)
with a monochromatic excitation source (Al Kα ray; 1486.6 eV),
Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Jobin Yvon – LabRAM ARAMIS, 473
nm excitation), contact angle with water (Digidrop GBX, fast model/60),
and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Horiba Jobin Yvon –
LabRAM ARAMIS, spectral ranges, 650 and 4000 cm–1). XPS, contact angle, and Raman spectroscopy data can be found in
the Supporting Information.

Electrochemical Measurement
All the experiments were
performed at room temperature. Electrochemical experiments were performed
in aqueous solutions using water from a Milli-Q purification system
of a resistivity of 18 MΩ cm. Water was degassed for 20 min
by bubbling argon prior to experiments. The electrochemical experiments
were carried out with a three-electrode glass cell. The working electrode
was either a millimetric glassy carbon electrode (3.0 mm diameter)
or an ultra-microelectrode (10 μm diameter). A Pt wire was used
as the counter electrode, while a Ag/AgCl electrode was employed as
the reference. Cyclic voltammetry was performed with electrodes before
and after grafting by the Diels–Alder reaction. Ferri/ferrocyanide
Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64– at equal concentration of both forms, namely, 2.10–3 mol L–1 for each species, was used in aqueous
media (in 0.5 M KCl) as a redox probe to evidence the surface modification.
Ohmic drop compensation was applied before each measurement.
