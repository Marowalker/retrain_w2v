Simple, fast, and
sensitive molecularly imprinted composite thin-film-based
electrochemical sensor developed by using in situ co-electropolymerization
of aniline and acrylic acid in the presence of melamine as a template
is described here. The prepolymerization complex formation was studied
by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry, while
the film formation was performed and characterized by cyclic voltammetry,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The optimization of important parameters and removal of melamine
generated the binding sites in the polymer matrix, which can recognize
melamine specifically. Electrochemical measurements were performed
to achieve the linear range, the limit of quantification, and limit
of detection of 0.1–180, 0.0573, and 0.0172 nM, respectively.
The sensitivity of the sensor was attributed to the synergistic effects
of amine from aniline and the carboxylic group from acrylic acid to
form multiple noncovalent interactions with the template. Melamine-spiked
infant formula and raw milk were analyzed by the developed sensor,
and the recovery range of 95.87–105.63% with a relative standard
deviation of 1.11–2.23% was obtained. The results showed that
the developed sensor using the new composite polymer receptor is promising
for the online monitoring of melamine in the food industries in the
future.

Introduction
Melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine)
is a weak base, nonedible,
nonhygroscopic, white crystalline solid, melts with decomposition
above 347 °C, sublimes at temperatures below its melting point,
and slightly soluble in water (0.38 or 3.7 g/mL of water at 20 or
90 °C, respectively). It is a nitrogen-rich synthetic molecule
(66.6% by weight) used in for-profit milk adulteration as the fake
protein source and cannot be identified by indirect protein assays
based on the total nitrogen content.1 Powdered
infant formula, milk-containing products, and pet food from China
are some examples of melamine contamination incident recorded previously.
This health issue was due to the acute renal failures in animals and
humans related to kidney stone formation associated with the presence
of melamine and cyanuric acid in consumed food and feeds.1,2 Therefore, online monitoring of the intended addition of melamine
into foodstuff during food production is very important by applying
relatively cheap, fast, and sensitive analytical methods like chemical
sensors.

The high demand of modern society for fast, selective,
sensitive,
user-friendly, portable, and real-time analysis for food safety, medical,
environmental, and security applications makes biochemical sensors
most interesting.3 However, preparation,
handling, and stability problems of the biorecognition materials used
in the sensor fabrication combined with their continuous increase
in price harnessed its competition with other standard analytical
techniques.4 Synthetic recognition materials
such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) become potential alternative
materials because of their broader advantages.5 A molecular imprinting technique is the polymerization of a functional
monomer and a cross-linker around a template molecule from the prepolymerization
complex. Following the template removal, three-dimensional binding
sites are generated to recognize the template molecule or its analogue
specifically.6−8

Molecularly imprinted conducting polymers (MICPs)
provide further
opportunities by combining the recognition properties of MIP with
the electronic–optical properties and the easy deposition of
conducting polymers on to the substrates for modern electronics.9−11 The electrical properties of the MICP layer of the chemical sensor
change when it rebinds the template and generates the relationship
between the concentration of the template molecule and the measured
electrical property or signal like current, potential, conductivity,
or capacitance.12 Such a kind of approach
leads to the development of an MIP-based electrochemical sensor with
high specificity, sensitivity, strong adherence of the sensing layer
to the electrode, stability, and real-time analysis.9

The reversible doping/dedoping process and easily
processable and
controllable chemical and electrochemical properties of conducting
polymers make them promising materials in modern electronic devices.
From the conducting polymers, polyaniline (PANI) is the one most studied
owing to its high electrical conductivity, excellent electronic and
optical properties, good redox behavior, stability, low cost, and
simple preparation process.13 Electrochemical
synthesis of electroactive PANI films on the conducting substrates
can be performed using potentiostatic, galvanostatic, or potentiodynamic
cyclic voltammetry (CV).13,14 Owing to a wide spectrum
of properties, PANI is used as a material for sensors and actuators,
fuel cells, solar batteries, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors,
field-effect transistors, and many other purposes.15,16 However, the use of pure PANI in electronic devices is limited because
it performs well only in acidic media of pH less than or equal to
4 and its conductivity is unstable at neutral pH. Therefore, material
modification is important to impart the desired conductivity and stability
as well as functionality.16 A great deal
of effort has been made in the improvement of polymer sensing materials
for the chemical sensor preparations. This can be done either by amending
the polymer molecular structures, altering dopants, and incorporating
another component into the conducting polymers.17 Homma and his co-workers developed a glucose sensor using
polyaniline-polyacrylic acid (PANI-PAA) composite film.18 Sensing material modification with organic acids
like acrylic and methacrylic acid increases the binding sites since
the carboxyl groups act as a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor simultaneously.19 This amendment introduces other functional units,
with good mechanical and chemical properties, via electrostatic interactions
between the amine and carboxylic groups. MIP-based chemical melamine
(MA) sensors were reported mainly based on methacrylic acid.20−23 Also, very few reports on pyrrole,24 ionic
liquids,25,26 7-(4-vinylbenzyloxy)-4-methyl coumarin-acrylic
acid copolymer,27o-aminophenol,28p-aminobenzoic acid,29 and mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane30 are available. This implies that much work remains
on the development of new molecular recognition elements for effective
detection of this template. Most importantly, MICPs and their composites
are not reported, except polypyrrole, but they are supposed to be
promising functional materials for the development of sensitive and
selective chemical sensors in the future. Hence, it is interesting
and important to introduce organic–organic composite multifunctional
materials as a sensing layer through material engineering. For this
purpose, we have selected aniline and acrylic acid functional monomers
to exploit the synergistic advantages of their composites arising
from the PANI conducting polymer with unique properties and acrylic
acid, the common hydrogen bond donor and acceptor monomer. The aim
of the present work is to develop an electrochemical sensor for melamine
determination through the synthesis of conducting polymer composite
film sensing material. Our approach focuses on investigating the triplet
of hydrogen bond donor–acceptor–donor group (D–A–D)
pattern of melamine with a spacing of 4.8 Å31 (Scheme 1) to form complementary intermolecular bonds with appropriately spaced
functional group triplets comprising hydrogen bond acceptor–donor–acceptor
(A–D–A) units of PANI-PAA composite. The hydrogen bond
interactions between the template melamine and the functional monomers
were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) to understand the
complex formation and facilitate the MIP film preparation and characterization.
We use in situ electropolymerization to deposit melamine-imprinted
poly(aniline-co-acrylic acid) composite thin film
on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to develop melamine electrochemical
sensors. The fabricated voltammetric sensor was applied for the detection
of MA in the laboratory sample and infant formula milk samples with
good recoveries.

the MI-PANI-PAA
Sensor for Melamine Detection (D—Donor and A—Acceptor)
Results and Discussion
Functional Monomer–Melamine
Interactions
Melamine
molecule fulfills the criteria for selecting the template, such as
having many functional groups (Scheme 1) accessible for interacting with functional monomers,
stable at polymerization conditions, easily available, and of low
cost for the preparation of MIP. The amines and imines in the template
enable it to form hydrogen bonding with both hydrogen bond donor and
acceptor molecules like aniline and acrylic acid. Theoretically, multiple
noncovalent interactions are expected to occur between the model template
and the monomers. This phenomenon was experimentally confirmed by
the FTIR study.

In pure aniline (ANI) solution, the FTIR peaks
at 3338 and 1635 cm–1 are due to the N–H
stretching vibrations and C=N stretching deformation of the
quinoid ring. The bands at 3316 and 1638 cm–1 are
due to the N–H stretching vibrations in secondary amines and
−C=O stretching in carboxylic groups for the aniline
(ANI) and acrylic acid (AA) mixture. The prepolymerization solution
containing ANI, AA, and melamine (MA) showed shifted and new peaks
at 3304, 1634, 1045, 1016, and 765 cm–1 due to N–H
stretching vibration, C=N and C=O stretching, C–H
bending in the aromatic ring, C–N group vibration, and C–H
bending out-of-plane deformation, respectively. The change in absorbance
and wavenumber (Figure 1) shows the formation of hydrogen bonding and other noncovalent interactions
between the monomers and the template molecule. The bands at 3316
and 1638 cm–1 are due to the N–H stretching
vibrations in secondary amines and −C=O stretching in
carboxylic groups. The significant shift in both absorbance and wavenumber
from pure ANI to the mixture of ANI–AA and then to the mixture
of ANI–AA–MA is due to the change in the structure–spectral
relationships of the associated molecular vibration. The shift in
absorbance is due to the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond
vibration. The appearance of new peaks around 100 cm–1 indicates that there a change in the complex due to interaction
with the template by forming either hydrogen bonding or π–π
interactions. The sharp peak observed at about 1000–900 cm–1 is due to C–H stretching and C=C bending.
The major peaks of ANI, ANI–AA, and ANI–AA–MA
and new peaks observed are summarized in Table 1.

Figure 1 FTIR spectrum of the mixture of ANI and acrylic
acid (AA) and the
prepolymerization mixture of ANI, AA, and melamine (MA).

Table 1 Absorbances and the Wavenumber Assignments
of ANI, ANI–AA, and ANI–AA–MA
material	absorbance	wavenumber
(cm–1)	
ANI	0.2683	3338	
0.11928	1635

0.09212	1634

0.03733	960	
0.005174	765	
Generally, there is a decrease in
absorbance and wavenumber from
pure ANI to ANI–AA to ANI–AA–MA. This phenomenon
is responsible for the formation of a stable complex between the template
and functional monomers, which is the main precondition for molecular
imprinting technology. The modification of ANI with AA and the interaction
of the template with the monomers paved the preparation of the melamine-imprinted
composite film on the GCE.

Electrochemical Synthesis and Characterization
of the Composite
Films
Both MI-PANI-PAA and nonimprinted poly(aniline-co-acrylic acid) (NI-PANI-PAA) films were deposited on the
electrode surface using the potentiodynamic method (Figure 2A). The formation of the MI-PANI-PAA
film on the dichloroethylene (DCE) was confirmed by using electrochemical,
FTIR, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Electrochemical
properties of the PANI-PAA films were investigated by CV using Ag/AgCl
in acetate buffer solution (ABS) (at pH 7.0 and room temperature),
which was purged with nitrogen gas before the actual measurement.
The modification of the electrode surface changed the current response
of the surface significantly (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 CV curves recorded during polymerization (A) and comparison
of
different electrodes (B) in 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– and 0.1 M KCl at 100 mV/s.

The as-prepared MI-PANI-PAA film has a higher current response
than the NI-PANI-PAA film revealing that the imprinting effect arises
due to the presence of the template enhanced the mass transfer and
electron flow at the interface. The higher current response indicates
that a fast reversible system is maintained due to the electroactive
nature of the melamine target. The reduction current is highly enhanced
when the template is interlocked in the binding cavities created during
polymerization and template extraction.

FTIR spectra of the
electrodeposited polyaniline-polyacrylic acid
composite film were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000–500
cm–1 under a transmission mode (Figure 3). The bands were assigned
to different functional groups or bonds.34−38 These strong and medium bands observed confirm the
formation of MI-PANI-PAA composite films in the presence of the template.

Figure 3 FTIR spectrum
of MI-PANI-PAA and NI-PANI-PAA.

In NI-PANI-PAA, the bands at 3334 and 1636 cm–1 are due to the −OH stretching in PAA and −NH bending
in amine of PANI. In Figure 3, the strong and broad band at 3334 cm–1 was minimized and shifted to 3266 cm–1, while
the medium and sharp peak at 1636 cm–1 was increased
and shifted to 1618 cm–1, indicating that there
is a strong interaction between the template and the monomers. For
the MI-PANI-PAA film, the peak at 3266 cm–1 corresponds
to the stretching vibration of −OH, which is shifted due to
the formation of hydrogen bonding with the template and the imprinting
effect. The band at 3000 cm–1 belongs to −NH
stretching vibration, confirming that the polymer composite was formed
as amine salt based on the electrostatic attraction.

The medium
peak observed between 2013 and 1618 cm–1 corresponds
to the C–H bending vibration in the aromatic
ring of PANI. The strong and sharp band at 1618 cm–1 is due to C=C stretching vibration in aromatic amine, while
those located at 1314 and 1250 cm–1 are due to C–N
stretching vibrations found at different positions in PANI. The main
bands and their assignments are summarized in Table 2.

The sharp peak found at 1182 cm–1 accounts for
the −CO stretching vibration and that at 802 cm–1 belongs to C=C bending vibration. These appearances of new
strong and medium bands for MI-PANI-PAA composite films indicate the
successful formation of the materials with multiple functional sites.

SEM images of PANI, PAA, and MI-PANI-PAA (Figure 4B–D) composite film surface in acidic
media exhibited a porous fibrous structure. PANI and PANI-PAA look
smooth while PAA film is highly porous in nature. The coexistence
of the imprinted PANI and PAA is due to the electrostatic interaction,
which highly assisted the cross-linking of the composite polymer film
to exist as an amine salt. As can be observed, the surface of the
film looks like smooth and undistinguished. Generally, the SEM images
were consistent with the observed roughness and density for each respective
polymer/composite film.

Optimization Electrochemical Polymerization
Parameters
To achieve MIP films with better rebinding properties,
important
electrochemical synthesis parameters, such as the functional monomers
to template molar ratio, scan cycle, scan rate, and effect of pH on
the rebinding capacity of the polymer, were emphasized. The material
composition of the sensing layer gave different peak currents after
incubation in the melamine solution. Briefly, 0.1:0.2:0.01, 0.1:0.2:0.01,
0.3:0.2:0.01, 0.2:0.3:0.01, 0.2:0.4:0.01, and 0.2:0.1:0.01 molar ratios
of (ANI/AA/MA) were used to fabricate different sensors (Figure 5A). From the present
data, the high current response was achieved at a molar ratio of 0.2:0.2:0.01
(ANI/AA/MA), and the composition of this material was selected as
the optimum molar ratio for the sensor construction.

Figure 5 Different molar ratios
of ANI–AA–MA (A), scan cycle
(B), scan rate (C), and pH (D) and their current responses after incubating
in 0.1 mM MA solution and transferring to 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– and 0.1 M KCl for CV measurement
at 100 mV/s.

Different sensors were made by
using different scan cycles (5,
10, 15, 20, and 25) while keeping the scan rate constant. The scan
cycle of 10 produced the film with high template binding capability
(Figure 5B) and was
chosen for the preparation of the MI-PANI-PAA/GCE sensor.

To
investigate the effect of the scan rate used during polymerization
on the final performance of the sensor, five different sensors were
fabricated by varying the scan rates (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mV/s)
using 10 scan cycles to investigate the effect of the scan rate on
the final performance of the sensor.

The highest current peak
corresponding to the high uptake of the
analyte was obtained by the sensor prepared using 100 mV/s, and it
was selected for the fabrication of the MI-PANI-PAA/GCE sensor in
the present work (Figure 5C).

The interaction between the recognition sites generated
on the
surface of polymer films and the template depends on the acidity or
alkalinity of the solution used during the rebinding study. As a result,
optimization of pH is very important for better performance of the
sensor. Here, ABS with different pH values (5, 6, 7, and 8) was used
for the incubation of the sensor in melamine solution (Figure 5D).

The ABS with pH 7
containing melamine favors the strong interaction
between the polymer composite film and melamine that resulted in a
high peak current response. The high current value indicates that
the labeling solution ([Fe(CN)6]3–/4–) easily infuses through the polymer films and creates fast electron
flows and reversibility of the system. Hence, pH 7 was selected for
all rebinding experiments. The present result shows that the MI-PANI-PAA
film works well in neutral solutions as reported before.25

Template Extraction and MI-PANI-PAA Film
Incubation Time
After the successful synthesis of the MIP
films, the next most important
step is effective template removal and rebinding study.36 Complete removal of the imprint molecule leads
to the formation of sufficient accessible recognition sites or binding
sites.39 Therefore, the optimum removal
of the template/imprint molecule is very important in the MIP sensor
development. Template extraction was done by applying the solvent
extraction method using dimethyl sulfoxide and acetic acid (4:1, v/v)
in ABS at neutral pH. The removal of the template was monitored by
recording the change in current at each time interval until no significant
change in current was observed, as shown in Figure 6A.

Figure 6 Template extraction (A) and incubation time
(B) monitored by CV
in 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– and 0.1
M KCl at 100 mV/s.

Melamine extraction from
MI-PANI-PAA/GCE was done by soaking the
sensor in extraction solvents through continuous stirring to facilitate
the extraction. The optimum time required for the present sensor was
35 min, and this time was used in all experiments. Beyond this time,
there is no change in the current response, indicating the complete
removal of the template from the polymer matrix. The recognition sites
obtained by template extraction need to rebind the template or similar
molecule selectively. The sensor was incubated in ABS containing a
known amount of melamine at pH 7 for different time intervals to study
the rebinding process.

The current responses were monitored
by CV until no change in the
current response value was observed. As shown in Figure 6B, the incubation of 20 min
is the optimum time because, after this, there is no current increase,
and this value was selected as an optimum time for rebinding processes.

Effect of MA Concentration on the Performance of the Sensor
Different concentrations of MA (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140,
160, and 180 nM) were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solution.
The analytical performances of the sensor were evaluated by applying
the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The calibration curves for
the relationship between changes in the current peak and increasing
standard concentration of the template were constructed under optimized
conditions for the evaluation of the analytical performance of the
MI-PANI-PAA/GCE sensor (Figure 7A). As depicted in Figure 7B, a positive linear relationship between the current
response and negative logarithmic concentration of MA was observed
from 0.1 to 180 nM. The linear regression equation was the peak current, Ip (μA) = 2.443[−log Melamine]
+ 13.024 in the concentration range of 0–180 nM with a correlation
coefficient R2 = 0.9998. Limit of quantification
(LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) were calculated using the equation
LOQ = 10Sb/m and LOD
= 3Sb/m, where Sb and m are the standard deviations
of the blank for 10 measurements and the slope of the calibration
curve, respectively.40 The calculated LOD
and LOQ are 1.72 × 10–11 and 5.73 × 10–11 M, respectively.

Figure 7 Current response of different concentrations
of MA (A), calibration
curve (B), specificity (C), and selectivity (D) of the MI-PANI-PAA/GCE
sensor monitored by DPV in 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– and 0.1 M KCl at an amplitude of 0.05 V and pulse width of 0.05
s.

One of the primary requirements
of the MIP-based sensing layer
is the selective recognition of the template molecule in the presence
of other molecules. This feature is due to the presence of specific
binding sites and cavity created in the MIP materials41,42 during the polymerization and template extraction processes.

The specificity of the developed sensor was evaluated by comparing
the current response of the three different electrodes, namely, MI-PANI-PAA/GCE,
NI-PANI-PAA/GCE, and bare GCE, after incubating them in 20 μM
MA using DPV. The results showed that there is a great difference
between the modified and unmodified electrodes as well as the imprinted
and nonimprinted polymer-modified electrodes (Figure 7C). These major differences arise from the
imprinting effect, which highly assisted in the recognition of the
template, interestingly. To study the selectivity of the MIP sensor,
the DPV of MA and structural analogues such as acetoguanamine (AGA)
and diaminomethylatrazine (DMT) on MIP sensor were obtained after
immersing the sensor into 5 mM ABS (pH 7) containing 10 μM melamine
and 30 μM each of the analogues, and the results are shown in Figure 6D.

The presence
of interferences does not affect the performance of
the sensor significantly. Compared with melamine, the current responses
generated by DMT and AGA are very small, and the MI-PANI-PAA/GCE has
good selectivity and sensitivity toward the template. This may be
attributed to the creation of three-dimensional cavities that are
complementary in shape, size, and conformation to the template but
not to the interferents. This means the interferents used here do
not fit into the binding cavities of the polymer and, thus, their
current response is minimal.

The application of target analyte
as a template model during polymerization
provides an advantage of selectivity. Furthermore, the commonly occurring
interferents, such as cyanuric acid and cyromazine, were applied as
interference to control the selectivity of the imprinted thin composite
film sensor. However, no current signals were observed for both of
them. This might be due to the differences in the functional groups
and their orientation.

Reusability, Reproducibility, and Stability
of MI-PANI-PAA/GCE
Sensor
The recycling of MI-PANI-PAA/GCE during repeated utilization
was studied by replicate template extraction and incubation processes.
The sensor can be used up to five times by maintaining ≥90%
of its original current response (Figure 8A). After seven cycles, about 86.15% of its
response was sustained. Both the fabrication method and measurement
reproducibility were investigated for the developed sensor, as indicated
in Figure 8B,C. For
the repeatability of the fabrication method, three different sensors
were fabricated following the same procedure and protocols described
in the previous section. The rebinding of the same solution of melamine
was observed and current response due to the binding of the template
was recorded.

Figure 8 Recycle (A), fabrication and measurement (B, C), and stability
(D) of MI-PANI-PAA/GCE sensor and the corresponding current responses
monitored by DPV at an amplitude of 0.05 V and pulse width of 0.05
s.

The current values were 328.8,
330.1, and 336.7 μA, respectively,
with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.28%. This indicates that
the fabrication method has good reproducibility with insignificant
deviation from one another. Five different electrodes were prepared
by the same method and used to measure the same amount of melamine
solution (20 μM) to study the measurement reproducibility. The
current responses were 329.83, 329.46, 328.75, 328.59, and 329.28
μA, with RSD of 0.159%, confirming that the sensor has good
and acceptable reproducibility to detect melamine. The operational
stability of binding sites is the most important factor that affects
the performance of MIP-based sensors in addition to the polymer materials’
stability itself. The damage of these recognition sites significantly
affects both the selectivity and sensitivity of the sensor.42,43 For evaluating the long-time stability of the proposed sensor, it
was kept in ambient conditions for 35 days.

At different storage
periods between 1 and 35 days, the sensor
was used to detect the same melamine solution (20 μM) in 50
mM ABS (pH 7) after every 5 days starting from the first day and the
current response was measured by DPV. The obtained results indicated
that the peak current retained 90% of its first current until 20 days,
indicating that the fabricated sensor had good long-term stability,
as depicted in Figure 8D. The decline in the current response after 3 weeks might be primarily
due to the damage of the recognition cavities or the washing away
of the film from the electrode’s surface due to degradation
or poor adhesion.

Practical Application of the Sensor and Comparison
with Other
Methods
Melamine from milk samples was treated using the
method reported elsewhere.44 Briefly, melamine
extraction was performed using acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) as
extracting solvents and filtered by using a filter (0.45 μm)
after centrifuging the sample for enough time. The proposed sensor
was applied for the determination of melamine in commercial infant
formula milk samples to evaluate its practical applications. A known
amount of melamine samples was added to the milk sample in three levels
and detected by the DPV method. As can be seen (Table 3), the values obtained by the proposed sensor
achieved a recovery of 93.2–105.63% with RSD between 1.11 and
4.5%.

To further study the performance of the MI-PANI-PAA/GCE
sensor,
the developed sensor’s analytical performances were compared
with the previously reported results of other MIP-based sensors with
different transduction mechanisms (Table 4).

Conclusions
The current results described a new molecular recognition element
based on molecularly imprinted PANI-PAA composite film being successfully
electrosynthesized on the GCE for the detection of melamine in infant
formula. The presence of PAA successfully modified the electrochemical
properties of PANI to work at neutral conditions. The voltammetric
sensor developed performs in a neutral solution to recognize the melamine
template in both artificial and real samples. The optimization of
important parameters and template removal generated melamine-binding
cavities in MI-PANI-PAA film with enhanced sensitivity to achieve
the calculated detection limit of 0.0172 nM and the recovery range
of 95.87–105.63% with a relative standard deviation of 1.11–2.23%.
The sensitivity of the proposed sensor may be attributed to the synergistic
effect of the amine, carboxylic, and aromatic rings in the functional
monomers/polymer composite. Moreover, the synthesized polymer composite
films showed stability and proved as promising molecular recognition
elements for the online monitoring of melamine occurrence in the food
industry in the future.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Reagents
Melamine (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich,
M2659), acrylic acid (anhydrous, >99%, Sigma-Aldrich), aniline
(≥99.99%,
Sigma-Aldrich, 242284), methanol (≥99.9%), ethanol (>99%),
nitric acid (70%), sulfuric acid (99.98%), dimethyl sulfoxide (AR),
acetic acid (≥99.85%), sodium acetate (≥99%), potassium
chloride (AR), hydrochloric acid (AR, 37%), sodium hydroxide (AR),
potassium ferrocyanate (AR, >99%) and deionized water (DIW). Prior
to use, aniline and acrylic acid were purified by distillation and
stored under nitrogen gas at 10 °C. To avoid the self-polymerization
of acrylic acid, 80% aqueous solution was prepared by using the distilled
acrylic acid. All standard solutions used in this work were prepared
by using deionized water (DIW) (18.2 MΩ cm) that was purified
by a purity purification system (Inexuxu model 2232, Biotech Pvt Ltd.,
Simens, Germany). Melamine standard solutions were prepared from melamine
standard in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted with acetonitrile
during experimental works.

Instrumentation and Apparatus
Three
electrode system
CHI660D electrochemical workstation (CHI instrument) was used for
all electrochemical measurements and polymer synthesis. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded on an Avatar
360 spectrophotometer (Thermo Nicolet) using KBr pellet in the wavenumber
region of 4000–450 cm–1. Scanning electron
micrograph (SEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL JSM 6500
F microscope equipped with a field emission source.

Electrode Preparation
GCE, saturated calomel electrode
(Ag/AgCl) (saturated with 3 M KCl), and solid platinum were used as
a working, reference, and counter electrode, respectively. The working
electrode was prepared by mechanically polishing it with 0.3 and 0.05
μm alumina slurry and then sequentially soaked in dilute nitric
acid, ethanol, and deionized water for not less than 3 min each. The
cleaned electrode was characterized with cyclic voltammetry (CV) in
[Fe(CN)6]3–/4– and 0.1 M KCl between
the sweeping potentials of −0.6 to +0.6 V at 100 mV/s. Then
the surface of the GCE was activated by CV scanning between −0.2
and 1.0 V in 0.5 M sulfuric acid electrolyte, rinsed with deionized
water, blown with nitrogen gas, and air-dried. After this, the electrode
was ready for surface modification with the imprinted thin composite
film.

Preparation of MI-PANI-PAA Composite Film
There are
covalent and noncovalent approaches to synthesize MIPs. However, the
latter is more progressive due to advantages such as the availability
of various functional monomers for different analytes, simplicity
of template extraction, and reversibility of the method.32,33 Here, the functional monomers were selected based on the noncovalent
interactions with the melamine template, as depicted in Table 5. FTIR was used to evaluate
and understand the formation of hydrogen bonds and the prepolymerization
complex. The six nitrogen atoms in the structure of melamine act as
hydrogen bond acceptor units, while the three amine groups (−NH2) acts as hydrogen bond donor units. Thus, this molecule has
the ability to form hydrogen bonding with both hydrogen bond donor
and acceptor molecules simultaneously. Therefore, we have selected
aniline that has one hydrogen bond donor unit and acrylic acid, which
consists of one hydrogen bond donor unit and two hydrogen acceptor
units. The FTIR results confirmed that there is an interaction between
the template and the monomers, forming a relatively stable prepolymerization
complex.

Then, the molecularly
imprinted poly(aniline-co-acrylic acid) (MI-PANI-PAA)
film was deposited on GC surface from
the solution containing 0.2 M ANI, 0.2 M AA, and 0.01 M MA in acetate
buffer solution (ABS, pH 3.5) based on multiple noncovalent interactions
between them. The nonimprinted poly(aniline-co-acrylic
acid) (NI-PANI-PAA) composite films were fabricated using the same
procedure in the absence of MA for comparisons. In this work, an electrochemical
sensor for the sensitive and selective detection of melamine, based
on an MICP composite receptor is prepared through electropolymerization
of aniline and acrylic acid in the presence of the melamine as a temple.
The general construction of the MI-PANI-PAA/GCE sensor for melamine
detection is presented in Scheme 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MICP
organic–organic composite recognition element reported to detect
melamine using basic and acidic functional monomers.

The optimized
electrochemical parameters used during polymerization
steps were: sweeping potential −0.2 to +1.0 V, scan rate 100
mV/s, and scan cycles 10, respectively. After rinsing the fabricated
electrode with buffer, the template was removed from the polymer films
by washing it with a dimethyl sulfoxide and acetic acid (4:1, v/v)
mixture in ABS buffer (pH 7.0) for about 35 min. After drying, the
prepared sensors were incubated in MA solutions for rebinding investigation
for 20 min.
