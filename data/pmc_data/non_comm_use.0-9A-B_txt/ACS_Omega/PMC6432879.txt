Highly active and durable electrocatalysts
are vital for commercialization
of direct methanol fuel cells. In this work, a three-dimensional nanocomposite
consisting of platinum nanoparticles, W18O49 nanocables, and reduced graphene oxide composite (Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO) has been prepared as an electrocatalyst
for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst is prepared through
a two-step method. The W18O49 nanocables and
the reduced graphene oxide composite are prepared by a solvothermal
process. Then, Pt nanoparticles are loaded on the W18O49 nanocables and the reduced graphene oxide composite by a
hydrogen reduction at ambient condition. The obtained catalyst has
a special three-dimensional architecture consisting of two-dimensional
nanosheets, assembled one-dimensional nanocables, and the loaded nanoparticles
on their surface. The Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
catalyst shows 1.56 time mass activities than the Pt/C, with the current
density of the forward anodic peak reaching 1624 mA/mgPt at 0.854 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode potential in 0.1
M HClO4 and 0.5 M CH3OH mixed electrolyte. It
also shows a strong antipoisoning property toward CO. For the durability
testing, the current density of Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
shows a 37% decay, whereas the current of Pt/C catalyst shows a 41%
degradation from 600 to 3600 s at 0.7 V. The high activity toward
MOR, good antipoisoning for intermediate products, and excellent stability
are ascribed to strong metal–support interaction effects between
the Pt nanoparticles and the W18O49 NCs.

1 Introduction
Platinum-based
catalysts were used in both electrodes of direct
methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Preparing platinum nanoscale catalysts
with special morphologies, such as platinum nanoparticles,1−4 platinum nanonetwork,5 and other designed
Pt nanostructures,6−10 enable to improve the activity of platinum. But, it will lose active
sites during working, which results from poisoning of intermediate
species during anode reaction process in DMFCs.11−14 To overcome this problem, various
metal elements, such as Pd, Ni, and others were used for incorporation
into platinum to prepare alloy catalysts.15−17 It not only
reduces the amount of platinum but also improves the ability of CO
tolerance via a bifunctional mechanism.18−20 Unfortunately, many
alloy catalysts are not stable at the inclement circumstance in DMFCs.
Great efforts have been made to enhance the stability; some compositions
are easy to dissolve from the reaction interface of the alloy catalyst.21−25

Transition-metal oxides as a support composite with noble-metal
catalysts have attracted much attention due to their high activity,
stability, special microstructure and morphology, and other properties.26−29 In previous works, our group found that platinum and transition-metal
oxide composites, such as Pt/Mo4O1130 and Pt/W18O49,31 can improve both anti-CO-poisoning ability and
stability in harsh circumstance. It was ascribed to the contribution
of a strong metal–support interaction (SMSI). A reversible
reaction between WOx and tungsten bronze
compound (HxWOy) is an important medium in the methanol electro-oxidation reaction
process.31 It is helpful for the small
molecules adsorption on the Pt/W18O49 catalyst
surface. Meanwhile, the oxygen defect of W18O49 is beneficial for oxygen transport from catalyst to reaction interface.
But, the low conductivity between the reaction interfaces limits the
rate of electrocatalytic reaction.31 Although
we can find some transition-metal oxides with a better conductivity,
such as Mo4O11,30 Ti4O7,32 and W18O49,31,33 sometime, it is still
not good enough for the electrocatalytic reactions in DMFCs. The conductivity
of the catalysts still needs to be improved.

In this work, platinum
nanoparticles and W18O49 nanocables loaded on
reduced graphene oxide nanosheet composite
(Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO) as a new three-dimensional
(3D) nanostructured catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation was designed
and prepared successfully via a self-assembly method. The methanol
oxidation reaction (MOR) and CO stripping tests were used to compare
the electrocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized catalyst and
commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
shows better activity, durability, and anti-CO-poisoning ability than
the commercial Pt/C catalyst, which can be attributed to the highly
dispersed platinum nanoparticles and the SMSI between Pt, W18O49, and rGO. Various characterizations provide evidence
of the mechanism of enhanced catalytic properties. The present work
not only provides a promise catalyst for methanol electrocatalytic
oxidation but also presents an approach for designing various multifunctional
materials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of Nanostructure
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO Catalyst
Graphene
sheet as a conductive material was designed to enhance the conductivity
of the catalyst. The oxygenous group on the surface of graphene (especially
graphene oxide GO) would provide an attachment active site during
the growing W–O Magnéli phase. According to the previous
reports,33−35 the ethanol solvothermal condition of producing the
W18O49 nanocables (W18O49 NCs) and solvothermal condition for reduced graphene oxide are very
similar. W18O49 nanocables (W18O49 NCs), a substoichiometric tungsten oxide, can in situ grow
and reduce graphene oxide nanosheet to produce W18O49 NCs–rGO in a ethanol–water mixture solvothermal
system. Finally, platinum nanoparticles were loaded onto the tungsten
oxide to prepare a structural and functional optimization catalyst
for methanol oxidation reaction.

Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) patterns of W18O49 NCs–rGO and
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO samples. It indicates
that the as-prepared product is a pure monoclinic phase W18O19 (JCPDs No. 05-0392). The (010) peak shows the highest
intensity, suggesting a preferred crystal growth of the W18O49 NCs along [010]. No diffraction peaks of graphene
was observed. After Pt loading, broad platinum (111), (200), and (220)
peaks (JCPDS No. 04-0802) are observed. Morphology and microstructure
of the sample were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Figure 1a shows that the as-sythesized
product has a special 3D architecture consisting of two-dimensional
nanosheets rGO, assembled one-dimensional nanocables (W18O49 NCs), and highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles loaded
on their surface. Figure 1b shows the electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a selected
area, which can be indexed with the crystallographic planes of W18O49 NCs and Pt nanoparticles. Figure 1c shows the high resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image of W18O49 NCs–rGO with
Pt nanoparticles on the surface. The tungsten oxide nanocables are
about 2 μm in length and 10 nm in diameter (Figure S2a). The HRTEM image analysis shows the W18O49 NCs were grown along the [010] direction (Figures 1c,d and S2c). The graphene retains its original sheet-like
morphology (Figure S3). Figure 1e shows an HRTEM image of a
Pt nanoparticle in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
composite. The surface of the Pt nanoparticle is composed of alternating
the {100}, {111} facets and kinks at the corners, which normally are
the active sites for catalytic reactions. Figure 1f shows the particle size distribution statistics
of Pt nanoparticles, with a mean size of 2.71 ± 0.39 nm. It was
reported that platinum nanoparticles with 2–4 nm size exhibit
the highest activity for electrocatalysis.36−38 The Pt loading
in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO is 18.75 wt % analyzed
by induced coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).

A Pt nanoparticle on
the W18O49 NCs was observed
continuously during the electron beam irradiation under an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV, as shown in Figure 2. As time went by, the edge atom pointed by the arrow
moved with the energy gained from irradiation. The movement of the
edge atom exhibits a low activation energy of the bond breaking. It
implies a high activity of the catalyst.

The inset in (d) shows a Fourier transform (FT) pattern of the Pt
particle.

It is noted that there are defects
in W18O49 NCs as pointed by the two arrows (Figure S4a). From the enlarged part of the defect
region (Figure S4b), the shear plane marked
by arrows is the main
crystal structure of the Magnéli phase. Figure S4c presents another part of the same crystal, showing
relatively perfect crystal planes of (010) and (103). Figure S4d shows the computer-simulated atom
sites, further indicating that the W18O49 NCs
grow along the 010 direction.

Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetry
(TG) analysis were introduced
for further characterization on the W18O49 NCs–rGO.
Raman spectra of GO, W18O49 NCs, and W18O49 NCs–rGO are compared in Figure S5. The peaks located at 247 and 813 cm–1 for W18O49 NCs and W18O49 NCs–rGO are due to the stretching mode of the O–W–O
and W–O bonds. For the spectrum of graphene oxide, two broad
peaks at about 1334 and 1596 cm–1 can be assigned
to the D and G peaks of graphene nanosheets. The D band is stronger
than the G band in the spectrum of graphene oxide, which can be ascribed
to a disordered structure of the surface oxygenous groups.39,40 But the intensity ratio of IG/ID does not show an obvious change after the
reduction. It could be ascribed to the disordered structure of rGO,
which is induced by interactions between W18O49 NCs and graphene. The O–W–O bond, which connects W18O49 NCs and graphene, provided a probable bridge
for the electron transport to the delocalized δ bond of graphene.41,42 The weight loss of W18O49 NCs–rGO or
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO sample under heat treatment
in air can be an evidence of the carbon existing in the composite.
From Figure S6, a mass loss is observed
before 200 °C for both samples, which may be due to dehydration.
Another mass loss at 561 °C for W18O49 NCs–rGO
may be due to the carbon oxidation reaction. The latter mass loss
is actually a combination process of graphene oxidation and the oxidation
of W18O49 to WO3. The gained mass
is much less than the lost one, so it shows a serious mass loss. For
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO, carbon is lost at
a lower temperature, 458 °C, because of the loading of Pt nanoparticles
on W18O49 NCs–rGO. The loading of Pt
nanoparticles plays a key role in the catalysis of carbon oxidation
reaction. The activation energy of the carbon oxidation reaction was
reduced, which means there is an interaction between Pt catalyst and
the W18O49 NCs–rGO support.

To
characterize the change in oxidation states during synthesis,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out for
the samples of W18O49 NCs, W18O49 NCs–rGO, and Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO. Figure S7a shows the deconvolution results of
W4f peaks of W18O49 NCs, W18O49 NCs–rGO, and Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO.
The specific deconvolution results are listed in Table S1. In pure W18O49 NCs, the W5+ and W6+ are correlated to the binding energy
at 36.7 and 37.8 eV of the W 4f5/2 peak, the relative content
of W6+ was 0.83 at the surface. When W18O49 NCs were combined with rGO to form W18O49 NCs–rGO, the W 4f5/2 peaks related to W5+ and W6+ were moved to 37.2 and 38.3 eV, respectively.
The relative content of W6+ increases to 0.89 on the surface.
During the solvothermal process, GO was reduced to rGO, and the oxygen
became a bridge to connect the W18O49 NCs and
rGO. Excess W6+ ions remained in the material. After Pt
loading, the relative content of W6+ was back to 0.72 on
the surface, the W 4f5/2 peaks related to W5+ and W6+ shifted to 37.8 and 38.2 eV, respectively. The
dissolving hydrogen reduces W6+ to W5+. These
shifts indicate that the interactions exist among the Pt nanoparticles,
W18O49 NCs, and rGO. The coexistence of W5+ and W6+ in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
is beneficial for the hydrogen spillover and oxygen buffering effects,
which can contribute to the improved tolerance toward intermediate
species and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.31

The catalytic activity of Pt is normally determined
by zero-valance
Pt0 and its oxides (PtO and/or PtO2). The XPS
spectra of Pt 4f in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
and Pt/C were deconvoluted to reveal the oxidation species (Figure S7b). The binding energy at 71.3, 72.2,
and 75.3 eV for the Pt 4f7/2 peak, together with three
corresponding subpeaks at 74.6, 75.5, and 78.6 eV for Pt 4f5/2 peak in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO corresponded
to Pt0, PtO, and PtO2, respectively.43,44 The peaks positions of Pt in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
are lower than those of the Pt/C. For example, the peak position of
zero-valence Pt0 in the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO is left-shifted about 0.2 eV compared to that of
Pt0 of the Pt/C due to a strong metal–support interaction
effect.31,45,46 The actual
Pt species loading was obtained by integrating the peak emission line
(Table S2). The percent ratio of Pt with
the higher valence states in the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
(57.76%) is equivalent to those in the Pt/C (57.34%). Normally, the
high valence states of Pt show high catalytic activity toward oxidation.

2.2 Electrocatalytic Performance of Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO for the MOR and Anti-CO-Poisoning Test
The small size of Pt nanoparticles and possible interaction of
between Pt catalyst and the W18O49 NCs–rGO
support in W18O49 NCs–rGO are favorable
to enhance its catalytic performance. It is normally believed that
the high catalytic current and the high stability at a given applied
potential were two important factors for a good catalyst in methanol
electro-oxidation. Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
with 18.75 wt % Pt loading was used for electrochemical measurements.
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of the MOR for the Pt/C and Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO are shown in Figure 3a. The forward anodic peak
of the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO is observed
at 0.854 V, which is 0.018 V lower than that of the commercial Pt/C
at 0.872 V. The current density of forward anodic peak for Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO is 1624 mA/mgPt,
which is 1.56 times that of the Pt/C (1040 mA/mgPt). The
backward anodic peak of the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
is at 0.725 V, which is 0.033 V higher than that of the commercial
Pt/C (0.692 V). The current density is close to that of the backward
anodic peak. Thus, Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
gives a higher mass activity. The nanostructured Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO catalyst shows a higher catalytic performance
because the W18O49 NCs act as a bridge to connect
Pt nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets. This connection improves
the conductivity of the catalyst and reduces the ohmic drop of the
electrode. In Figure S6b and Table S2,
it can be found that Pt0 valence state in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO and Pt/C is almost the same. First,
it is believed that CH3OH is preferably adsorbed on the
surface of oxides. Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
exhibits a higher catalytic activity than the Pt/C catalyst due to
the following reasons. W18O49 NCs provides a
large amount of active sites for CH3OH absorption, and
the tunable ratio of W6+ to W5+ in W18O49 NCs causes the formation of the tungsten bronze (HxWOy) with a good
proton conductivity. Hydrogen spillover effect would promote the dehydrogenation
of CH3OH. Second, the number and efficiency of the active
sites are increased due to the synergistic effect because W18O49 NCs act as a oxygen reservoir, which may provide more
Oads species on the Pt surface.31

Figure 3 (a)
CV curves recorded under ambient atmospheric conditions in
a 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M CH3OH mixed solution
with a sweep rate of 100 mV/s. (b) Peak current of the forward scan
(If) and reverse scan (Ib).

In previous works, it
has been reported that the anodic peak in
the reverse scan is related to the removal of the intermediate species
absorbed on the catalyst surface, e.g., CO and HCOO–.31,45,47−51 These species occupy the active site of Pt, leading to decreasing
catalytic activity and energy transformation efficiency. Consequently,
the ratio of the forward anodic peak current density (If) to the backward anodic peak current density (Ib) can be also used to indicate the tolerance
of the catalyst toward intermediate products species. Usually, a catalyst
with a high ratio of If/Ib shows a good tolerance toward intermediate products.
It can be clearly found that the ratios of If/Ib for Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO and Pt/C are 1.16 and 0.75, respectively,
as shown in Figure 3b. The If/Ib ratio of Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO is 1.55
times than that of the Pt/C catalyst.

To further examine the
anti-methanol poisoning property, CO stripping
voltammetry was tested as a function of CO poisoning time in 0.1 M
HClO4 at ambient condition at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s.
A CO oxidation peak is found at 0.822 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE)) for the commercial Pt/C after purging with pure CO for 0.1–5
s, and the equilibrium CO coverage reaches within 0.1 s (Figure 4a). For Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO, the CO oxidation peak is observed
at about 0.743 V (vs RHE) after purging with pure CO for 1–30
s, and even after 30 s, the CO coverage does not reach an equilibrium
(Figure 4b). Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO exhibits a stronger CO tolerance
ability compared with the Pt/C. It is attributed to the SMSI between
Pt and composite support. As a poisoning molecular, CO is easily adsorbed
and covered at the active Pt sites and blocks the catalytic reaction.
The interactions between Pt and the W18O49 NCs
can promote a spillover of the oxygen along their interface, leading
to enrichment of the Oads species on the Pt surface, thus
promoting oxidation of intermediates (such as Pt–COads, Pt–CH3Oads, Pt–CH2Oads, and Pt–CHOads) to H2O and CO2. This regeneration makes Pt sites free for further
oxidation of methanol. It could be interpreted that the CO coverage
was not easy to reach the equilibrium for the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO system. Another reason might be that due
to the high specific area of rGO, some poisonous species might be
adsorbed on the surface of rGO to reduce the possibility of blocking
the active sites on the surface of Pt. So, the catalyst Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO shows a high CO tolerance and a high
anti-intermediate products poisoning properties. Normally, the electrochemically
active surface area can be estimated by measuring the charge associated
with Hupd adsorption (QH).
A comparison of the catalytic performance of Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO and other related catalysts reported in literatures
is listed in Table S3. It can be seen that
the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO composite catalyst
exhibits a higher mass activity, 1624 mA/mgPt.

Pt/C and (b) Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
samples.

Chronoamperometry test was usually
used to investigate the durability
of the catalyst. The test was estimated by CA sweeps at 0.7 V (vs
RHE) for 3600 s in an Argon-purged 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5
M CH3OH solution at room temperature. It indicates that
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO has a higher catalytic
current density for MOR than the Pt/C in the chronoamperometry test,
as shown in Figure 5. A comparison of the transient current densities of the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO and Pt/C catalysts is listed
in Table S4. The mass current density of
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO catalyst is almost
twice that of the Pt/C. Meanwhile, there was a 41% decrease in the
current density of the Pt/C catalyst from 600 to 3600 s during the
chronoamperometry test, whereas only 37% decrease in the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO is observed in the same test.

curves of the Pt/C and Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
at 0.7 V (vs RHE) in an Argon-purged 0.1
M HClO4 + 0.5 M CH3OH solution at ambient conditions.

The morphology of the catalysts
also has a great influence on the
activity of the reaction. Nanoparticles tend to agglomerate spontaneously
by Ostwald ripening. And, it is a thermodynamically favorable process.
To gain insight into the degradation mechanism of the Pt/C and Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO composite activity, Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO and Pt/C samples were prepared
and observed by TEM before and after chronoamperometry test, respectively.
As shown in the TEM image (Figure S8a,c), the Pt NPs are uniformly dispersed on the substrates in both samples
initially. Mean sizes of Pt NPs are 3.25 ± 0.32 and 2.18 ±
0.29 nm in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO and Pt/C,
respectively. After the test, it is observed that some platinum nanoparticles
dropped from carbon support due to the electrochemical corrosion (Figure S8b). Meanwhile, some Pt NPs become agglomerated
particles with a mean size of 7.25 ± 0.89 nm. The agglomeration
of Pt due to Ostwald ripening reduces the specific area of Pt NPs.
It leads to a decrease in the current density and the activity loss
of the Pt/C catalyst. No significant difference was observed for the
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO catalyst before and
after the test. Although some larger nanoparticles with a diameter
around 6–9 nm were observed after the test, the size of most
Pt NPs in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO after the
test is 3.30 ± 1.20 nm. So, it maintains a high current density
during the chronoamperometry test and exhibits a high stability. The
high catalytic activity and excellent stability of the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO are ascribed to the following two possible
reasons. First, there are strong SMSI effects between platinum and
W18O49 NCs. If no hydrogen gas is introduced
into the suspension system consisting of W18O49 NCs−rGO and K2PtCl4 during synthesis,
we can still observe the Pt nanoparticles marked by blue circles deposited
on the surface of W18O49 NCs, the (010) plane
was marked 0.378 nm, as shown in Figure S9. Pt NPs are difficult to oxidize due to the redox property of W18O49 NCs. Second, Pt NPs are well dispersed and
separated by the nanocables in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO.
This increases the barrier of the movement of the Pt NPs and reduces
the possibility of the collision of the particles and agglomeration.
Ostwald ripening is a thermodynamically spontaneous process, the barrier
is favorable for preventing them from agglomeration. Moreover, the
3D structure is also very stable because there is still strong connection
between W18O49 NCs and graphene via the O–W–O
bond. This bonding makes the W18O49 NCs connect
with the graphene nanosheet, which is favorable for electronic transport.
The unique oxygen defect structure and different valence states of
W in W18O49 NCs become active sites for Pt NPs
deposition and removing the adsorbed poisonous intermediate products
by oxygen reservoir function of W18O49. Figure S10 shows the electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of commercial Pt/C and Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO. It can be seen that the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO shows a smaller charge transfer resistance
compared to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This combination
of Pt NPs, W18O49 NCs, and graphene provides
more reactive centers for MOR and enhances the antipoisoning property
toward intermediate products. The unique structure of the composite
consisting of two-dimensional nanosheet and one-dimensional nanocable
is favorable for enhancing the stability of the materials. The well-dispersed
morphology is attributed to the interaction between tungsten oxide
and graphene oxide. This work may provide a new approach to prepare
3D nanostructured composite catalysts.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we prepared a 3D nanostructured composite Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO as an efficient and durable
catalyst for methanol oxidation reaction. Graphene oxide nanosheet
was reduced to graphene through a solvothermal process. As a conductive
support material, W18O49 NCs were produced and
assembled on the surface of rGO via oxygen atom bridges. Both W18O49 NCs and rGO nanosheets have good electronic
conductivity. The Pt NPs were loaded on the W18O49 NCs–rGO composite support via hydrogen reduction. W18O49 NCs are the active centers for the reduction reaction.
Pt NPs with a size of about 3 nm were homogeneously distributed on
the surface of W18O49 NCs–rGO. The SMSI
between platinum and W18O49 NCs–rGO provides
good reactivity for electrocatalysis. The forward anodic peak current
density of the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO nanocomposite
catalyst reaches 1624 mA/mgPt at 0.854 V (vs RHE) in 0.1
M HClO4 and 0.5 M CH3OH mixed electrolyte. It
is almost 1.56 times that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover,
Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO shows excellent CO
tolerance and anti-intermediate products poisoning properties. This
is attributed to spillover and oxygen buffering effects of composite
support of W18O49 NCs–rGO. The nanocomposite
catalyst also exhibits a long-term durability. This research opens
a new avenue to prepare promising catalysts to advance their applications
in direct methanol fuel cells and offers a rational strategy to design
heterogeneous catalysts.

during the alcoholysis process. Typically, 20 mg graphene oxide and
40 mg WCl6 were suspended and dissolved in 60 mL ethanol
via sonication. Then, the obtained dark yellow suspension was transferred
into a Teflon-lined autoclave and solvothermally treated at 180 °C
for 24 h. The black solid product was obtained by centrifugation and
washed by deionized water and alcohol and repeated five times. The
resulted product was denoted as W18O49 NCs–rGO,
which was dried at 60 °C under vacuum atmosphere for 12 h.

4.4 Synthesis of Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO
Catalyst
Pt nanoparticles were loaded on
the W18O49 NCs–rGO support via a hydrogen-assisted
reducing method. Typically, 40 mg W18O49 NCs–rGO
powder was dispersed in 50 mL ethanol via ultrasonication. Then, 2.5
mL K2PtCl4 water solution (1 g/100 mL) was added
to the suspension dropwise. It was magnetically stirred for 30 min
and continuously stirred with a 300 mL/min hydrogen gas flow into
the suspension for another 4 h. The obtained black product was washed
with deionized water and alcohol, dried at 60 °C under vacuum
atmosphere overnight, and denoted as Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO. The amount of Pt loading in Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO could be adjusted by changing the addition
volume of the K2PtCl4 solution.

4.5 Materials Characterization
The crystalline
phases of the W18O49 NCs–rGO support
and the Pt/W18O49 NCs–rGO nanocomposite
were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (D8 Advance,
Bruker, Deutschland). Raman spectra were measured with a micro-Raman
spectrometer (HR 800, Jobin Yvon, France) at 457.9 nm wavelength.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with Al Kα
radiation (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD, Britain). The thermal analysis was
measured by thermogravimeter (TG/differential thermal analysis (DTA),
6300, SEIKO, Tokyo, Japan). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was
performed on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4300, Japan).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on a microscope (JEOL JEM2100F,
Japan) operated at 200 keV. The compositions of the catalysts were
analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry
(ICP-AES, Thermo Fisher).

4.6 Electrochemical Measurements
Glassy
carbon electrodes were polished with alumina powder, ultrasonically
washed, and blow dried before being dropped into the catalyst ink.
The electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements are similar
to that reported in the literature previously.31 The same procedures were used to prepare Pt/C electrode
(Hispec3000, Johnson Matthey).

MOR tests were performed in a
0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M CH3OH solution at a scan
rate of 100 mV/s. Chronoamperometry measurements were carried out
in a 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M CH3OH solution after
a 50 cycle CV activity in Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution
at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. For details, please refer to the literatures.31 For CO stripping voltammetry, the procedures
are similar to those reported in the literature previously.31 For comparison, the potentials measured were
calculated to the values (vs RHE) automatically by the testing software.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed
on an Autolab electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N) in the frequency
range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with a bias voltage of 10 mV at 0.6
V (vs RHE). The solution for the EIS experiment is 0.1 M HClO4 with 0.5 M methanol, which was purged by argon gas.
