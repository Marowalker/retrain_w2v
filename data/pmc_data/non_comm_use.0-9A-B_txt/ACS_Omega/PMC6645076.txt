The impact of substituting Hg(II)
for Zn(II) in a thiolate-bridged
trinuclear cluster with parallels to a metallothionein metal cluster
was investigated. A new solvomorph of [Zn(ZnL)2](ClO4)2 (1) (L = N-(2-pyridylmethyl)-N-(2-(ethylthiolato)-amine)
and five solvomorphs of a new compound [Hg(ZnL)2](ClO4)2 (2) were characterized
by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The interplay of hydrogen
bonding and aromatic-packing interactions in producing lamellar, 2D
lamellar, and columnar arrangements of complex cations in the crystalline
state is discussed. Both variable temperature proton nuclear magnetic
resonance and electrospray ion-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) suggest
that the complex ions of 1 and 2 are the
predominant solution species at moderate concentrations. ESI-MS was
also used to monitor differences in metal ion redistribution as 1 was titrated with Hg(ClO4)2 and [HgL(ClO4)]. These studies document the facile replacement
of Zn(II) by Hg(II) with the preservation of the overall structure
in thiolate-rich clusters.

1 Introduction
The
fascinating interplay of structure and function has motivated
continuous efforts to prepare synthetic complexes inspired by metalloproteins.
Significant advances in our understanding of protein/metal binding
sites have come from the investigation of small synthetic complexes.1−7 Although small metal/ligand complexes reproduce only a small fraction
of the information encoded within the holoprotein framework, they
serve as milestones toward more elaborate models.8,9

Multimetallic proteins present especially complex synthetic challenges.6,10−14 The ubiquitous multimetallic metallothionein protein family has
a variety of exceptional properties, inviting further study.15 Unusual structural characteristics of metallothioneins
include low homology primary sequences with nearly 30% cysteine residues
and tertiary structures varying with metal occupancy. Metallothioneins
are multifunctional and commonly associated with Zn(II) and Cu(I)
homeostasis as well as removal of xenobiotic Cd(II) and Hg(II) metal
ions.16 The best characterized forms of
metallothionein have cysteine thiolate-bridged three- and four-metal
clusters.17−20 However, under physiological conditions, a wide variety of homo-
and heterometallic variants coexist with dynamical conformations.16,21−23 The spectroscopic techniques commonly used to monitor
the metallothionein metal ion exchange have provided limited information
about structural changes to the metal clusters.24 Significantly, despite strong association with Hg(II) detoxification,
there are no crystal structures of metallothionein bound to Hg(II).

Synthetic approaches to modeling the metal clusters of metallothionein
have commonly involved deprotonated mono- and dialkylthiolates.25 Self-assembly reactions between thiolates and
d10 metal ions invariably lead to a complex solution milieu
from which individual clusters must be crystallized for a detailed
characterization. Although the metal clusters of metallothionein are
predominantly cysteine-ligated, there is evidence from nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR),26,27 extended X-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS),28 and histidine modification
analyses29 for histidine ligation. Our
approach to expanding isolable metallothionein-like d10 metal ion clusters has focused on using multidentate mixed donor
ligands, incorporating thiolates and simple nitrogen donors as synthetic
counterparts of the bridging and nonbridging ligands, respectively.
In a recent work, we used tridentate ligand N-(2-pyridylmethyl)-N-(2-(ethylthiolato)amine) (LH; Figure 1) to prepare a novel complex
with a bicyclo[3.3.3]Hg5S6 core.30 On the basis of the electrospray ion-mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) evidence, this complex crystallized from a solution containing
complexes with a variety of Hg/L stoichiometries, a process
analogous to the physiological sequestration of Hg(II) in the kidneys
by metallothionein.

In this work, our focus shifted toward investigating mixed
HgZn
clusters as synthetic models of the metal substitution occurring when
Zn-metallothionein is confronted by the heavier congener. There are
only a modest number of structurally characterized mixed HgZn complexes,
and to the best of our knowledge, none involving alkylthiolate bridges.31 Furthermore, the only structurally characterized
trinuclear zinc complexes containing Zn(alkylthiolato)4 analogs of the zinc coordination reported for metal-saturated metallothionein
have incorporated a single ligand with an NC2NC2S synthon in common with L(32−34) or multiple
ligands.31 Known zinc complexes of L include [Zn(ZnL)2](BF4)2·2H2O (1′a)32 and [Zn(ZnL)2](ClO4)2·2CH3OH (1b).33 The [Zn(ZnL)2]2+ core of these complexes is shown schematically in Figure 2. The central position was
targeted for replacement by Hg(II). Significantly, the core cluster
offered hydrogen bond donors and aromatic rings for stabilizing intermolecular
interactions. In addition to preparing a new acetonitrile solvomorph
of the zinc cluster (1c), solvomorphs of [Hg(ZnL)2](ClO4)2 (2) in three different crystal systems were prepared by either direct
self-assembly or indirectly from 1 and [HgLClO4] (3). The new solvomorphs were characterized
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and their differences in packing
are discussed with respect to their relevance to metallothionein.
In addition, variable temperature proton NMR and ESI-MS are used to
analyze solution speciation and gain insight regarding the metal substitution
process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Complex
Synthesis
Deprotonated LH has been reported
to form complex cations of composition
[Zn3L4]2+, with counterions
generally described as noncoordinating (ClO4–, BF4–, and NO3–) irrespective of the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants and in
different solvents.32 Established methods
were used to prepare the initial precipitate with composition [Zn3L4](ClO4)2 (1) from water. Recrystallization of 1 from acetonitrile/toluene
by slow evaporation provided the new solvate [Zn(ZnL)2](ClO4)2·2CH3CN (1c).

Both direct and indirect methods of preparing [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2 (2) were investigated (Figure 3). In the direct method for preparing mixed HgZn complexes
of L by self-assembly, the components were mixed in various
mole ratios. An initial precipitate of [HgZn2L4](ClO4)2 (2) with
variable amounts of water was prepared by adding an aqueous solution
containing a 1:2 ratio of Hg(ClO4)2/Zn(ClO4)2 to an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide deprotonated LH in a 3:4 metal/ligand stoichiometric ratio. Recrystallization
of precipitate 2 by slow evaporation from acetonitrile/toluene
initially produced thin colorless plates of solvate 2·2H2O (2a) in a low yield. Brand and
Vahrenkamp previously reported isolation of 1a from methanol/water
and spectroscopic characterization, but no crystallographic characterization.32 Consistent with Ostwald’s step rule for
polymorph recrystallization,35 further
crystal growth from the mother liquor of 2a produced
solvomorphs with water replaced by higher concentration solvents.
Large, colorless prisms of mixed solvate 2·3CH3CN·0.75toluene (2d) were isolated next.
Additional crystal growth from the mother liquor of 2d provided very fine colorless needles of 2·CH3CN·1.5toluene (2e). Both the mixed solvates
were unstable to the loss of the solvent. In a subsequent preparation,
these three solvomorphs crystallized concurrently during slow evaporation
(Figure S3a). Polymorphs 2d and 2e were also recovered from the slow diffusion
of an acetonitrile solution of 2 into toluene. In addition,
we attempted to prepare an isomorph of acetonitrile solvate 1c by slow diffusion of ether into an acetonitrile solution
of precipitate 2a. However, the colorless needles produced
appeared to be a solvomorphic variant of 2d in which
toluene is replaced by badly disordered acetonitrile and ether (2h; Figure S4). Limited additional
direct syntheses with alternative Hg/Zn/L ratios did
not provide materials with promising diffraction, elemental analysis,
or NMR.

Figure 3 Syntheses of 1 and 2 and solvomorphs
studied. a Ref (32). b Ref (33).

To prepare 2 indirectly, precipitated [HgL(ClO4)] (3) was used as the source of Hg(II)
because ESI-MS studies suggested insignificant formation of 2 when 1–3 equiv of [Hg(ClO4)2] was added to 1 (vide infra). Two additional solvates
of 2 were prepared indirectly by slow evaporation from
an equimolar solution of 1 and 3 in acetonitrile/toluene.
Initially, marginal quality plates of 2·CH3CN·0.5toluene (2f) and 1c formed evaporatively
in trace amounts along with nondiffracting solids (Figure S3b). Plates of 1c, higher quality crystals
of 2f, as well as plates of 2·toluene
(2g) were produced concurrently and in low yield by slow
diffusion of an equimolar acetonitrile solution of 1 and 3 into toluene.

2.2 Single-Crystal Structures
Acyclic
trinuclear thiolate-bridged zinc(II) clusters with distorted tetrahedral
S4 central Zn(II) coordination and meridional (cis, trans,
and cis) N2N2′S2 octahedral terminal Zn(II) coordination
(Figure 2) are one
of several well-established coordination motifs for tridentate ligands
containing a 2-((2-aminoethyl)amino)ethanethiolato moiety.31 The octahedral sites of these complexes have
helical chirality (Figure 4). The characterized solvomorphs of 1 and 2 exhibited differences in hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions,
and packing motifs, which are somewhat analogous to the established
ability of metallothionein to adopt multiple conformations. Hence,
there was more incentive for an in-depth analysis of intermolecular
interactions than in most structural studies of coordination compounds.36

2.2.1 Unit Cell Contents, Symmetry, and Hydrogen
Bonding
The two known pseudopolymorphs of Zn3L42+ were isolated in tetragonal I4̅ ([Zn(ZnL)2](BF4)2·2H2O, 1′a)32 and triclinic P1̅ ([Zn(ZnL)2](ClO4)2·2CH3OH, 1b)33 crystal
systems. Complex 1′a was composed of two similar
independent trinuclear complexes, with S4 symmetry imposed by the crystal system and meso-octahedral stereochemistry.
By contrast, 1b consisted of a pair of inversion-related
pseudo-meso complexes. Stereochemistry and geometric parameters of
these trimetallic cores are summarized in Table 1 for comparison with the new compounds. To
preserve crystal integrity, data collection for new compounds was
started at 100 K promptly after removal of the mother liquor. With
the exception of 1b, all four amino protons of each trimetallic
complex ion are involved in hydrogen bonding. The diversity of hydrogen
bond patterns observed is reminiscent of the elusive role of the metallothionein
interdomain linker and limited success characterizing interdomain
contacts.37,38

New acetonitrile
solvomorph 1c (Figure 5a) crystallizes in the orthorhombic space
group Pna21 with four asymmetric units
in each unit cell. The asymmetric unit contains one pseudo-meso [Zn(ZnL)2]2+, two well-ordered perchlorates,
and two acetonitrile solvent molecules. One perchlorate bridges N(4)
and N(8) of twofold screw related molecules through hydrogen bonding.
This forms a molecular chain structure that zigzags along the b axis and undulates infinitely along the c axis (Figure 5b and Table 2). The remaining amino
hydrogens of the complex ion are hydrogen-bonded to either O(1) of
the second perchlorate or N(10) of an acetonitrile. The Zn3S4 core of the complex is somewhat compressed relative
to the known solvomorphs, with the smallest nearest neighbor and end-to-end
Zn···Zn separations (Table 1).

Complex 2a crystallized
in the tetragonal space group I4̅ and proved
to be a pseudoisomorph of 1′a with mercury and
perchlorate substituted for the central zinc and
tetrafluoroborate, respectively. The asymmetric unit of 2a contains two one-quarter [Hg(ZnL)2]2+ (Figure 6a) complex ions, one disordered perchlorate modeled over two positions,
and a water solvent molecule. The independent heterometallic complex
ions of 2a are more similar to each other than the complex
ions of the other two solvomorphs of 2 reported (Figure 7). The independent
molecules of 2a and 1′a are structurally
comparable, and the locations for the complex ion, counterion, and
solvent components of the asymmetric unit are similar (Figure 8). However, the orientation
of the water molecule is shifted, possibly as a result of differences
in hydrogen bonding. Both perchlorate positions have two oxygens involved
in hydrogen bonding, one with the N(2) hydrogen and one with a water
hydrogen. The water also acts as a hydrogen bond donor with S(1) of
one independent molecule and a hydrogen bond acceptor from N(2) resulting
in a three-dimensional network (Figure 6b, Table 2).

Heterosolvate 2d crystallized in the monoclinic space
group C2/c with eight asymmetric
units in each unit cell. The complex ion is present as a racemic mixture
of diastereomers (ΔΔ/ΛΛ). The asymmetric unit
contains one complex ion (Figure 9a), one ordered perchlorate, one perchlorate disordered
over two positions with unequal occupancy, a mixture of solvent molecules
including three disordered acetonitriles, one of which sits on a special
position, and three-quarters of a toluene coincident with some of
the disordered acetonitrile. The perchlorates are each hydrogen-bonded
to two amine nitrogens, forming a series of N(4)–N(8) and N(2)–N(6)
hydrogen bond bridges that give rise to a hydrogen-bonded ribbon of
pairwise alternating diastereomers parallel to the crystallographic ac plane (Figure 9b and Table 2).

Mixed solvate 2e crystallized
in the triclinic space
group P1̅. The complex ion is present as a
racemic mixture of diastereomers (ΔΔ/ΛΛ).
The ordered parts of the asymmetric unit include a single diastereomer
of the complex ion (Figure 10a), one well-ordered perchlorate, and one-half of a well-ordered
toluene sitting on a special position. The disordered parts of the
asymmetric unit include a perchlorate, an acetonitrile, and a toluene,
each modeled over two positions with unequal occupancy. The perchlorates
are each hydrogen-bonded to two amine nitrogens, forming a series
of N1–N3 and N5–N7 hydrogen bond bridges that give rise
to infinite hydrogen-bonded ribbons parallel to the crystallographic ab plane (Figure 10b and Table 2). The complex ion has the greatest degree of core puckering among
the trinuclear complexes investigated, with a Zn(1)···Hg(1)···Zn(1)
angle of 160.68(4) (Table 1).

Only the position of highest occupancy is shown for the disordered
perchlorate.

Mixed solvate 2f also crystallized in the triclinic
space group P1̅. The asymmetric unit of 2f contains one pseudo-meso (ΔΛ) [Hg(ZnL)2]2+ (Figure 11a), two well-ordered perchlorates, an acetonitrile,
and half a toluene. The toluene is located on an inversion center
between the central Hg of two complex cations. Infinite zigzag chains
of individual enantiomers are formed parallel to the crystallographic ab plane through perchlorate-mediated hydrogen bonding of
N(4) and N(8) (Figure 11b and Table 2). Similar
hydrogen-bonded chains are formed in 1b. A pair of oxygen
from the second perchlorate are hydrogen-bonded to the N(2) hydrogen,
and an acetonitrile is hydrogen-bonded to the N(6) hydrogen.

ellipsoid drawing for the complex ion of 2f showing the

Complex 2g crystallized in the monoclinic space
group P2/n with a crystallographic C2 axis running through the three metal ions
of the complex
ion (Figure 12 and Table 1). The asymmetric
unit contains one half of the pseudo-meso ΔΛ complex ion
(Figure 12a), a well-ordered
perchlorate, and a badly disordered toluene sitting on a special position.
The perchlorate ions bridge N(2) and N(4) of the inversion-related
complexes by a pair of hydrogen bonds, forming infinite ribbons parallel
to the (101) crystal plane (Figure 12b and Table 2). The HgZn2S4 core of the complex is
slightly more compact than the other solvomorphs of 2, with smaller intramolecular Zn···Hg and Zn···Zn
separations despite the Zn(1)–Hg(1)–Zn(2) angle of 180°
(Figure 7 and Table 1).

2.2.2 Interactions
between Pyridyl Ends
One of the defining features of metallothioneins
is the absence of
aromatic amino acids other than histidine involved in metal coordination.
As a result, aromatic-stacking interactions are absent, helping to
ensure the metal dependence of structure acquisition. By contrast,
the roughly orthogonal meridional (cis, trans, and cis) octahedral
Zn(II) termini of 1 and 2 are conducive
to supramolecular structures through synergistic offset face-to-face
π–π (OFF) and edge-to-face π–σ
(EF) interactions.39,40 Although the N–Zn–N
angles ranged from 85° to 91° in the trinuclear complexes,
the angles between calculated pyridyl planes ranged from 62°
to 73°, consistent with some form of packing perturbation (Table 3). The attractive
aromatic interactions observed between the complex ions of 1 and 2 solvomorphs include concerted orthogonal fourfold
aryl embraces (EF)4 (Figure 13) as well as isolated EF, outer OFF, and
inner OFF interactions (Table 3).41 Toluene provided an additional
synthon for aromatic interactions in 2d–2g (Table 3 and Figure 14).
All meso and pseudo-meso complexes had extensive P2-(EF)
interactions between end-to-end aligned molecules. Only the racemic
complexes 2d and 2e and the meso complex
with the most puckered core 2f were found to have P2-(OFF) interactions. With the exception of 2e, the complex ions were packed in end-to-end columns.

2.2.3 Side-To-Side
Stacking Arrangements
The symmetric and pseudosymmetric rod-shaped
complex ions exhibited
a variety of side-to-side stacking arrangements (Table 3). Two-dimensional lamellar
packing arrangements were observed for individual stereoisomers in
orthorhombic 1c and for independent molecules in tetragonal 1′a and 2a. Columnar packing arrangements
were found for monoclinic complexes 2d and 2g. By contrast, the triclinic complexes 1b, 2e, and 2f had lamellar stacking of inversion-related
pairs. Side-to-side arrangements produced sizable solvent-filled channels
parallel to the (010) crystal plane and along the a axis in 2d and 2e, respectively (Figure 15), consistent with
the observed instability of their crystals to removal of the mother
liquor. Solvent molecules were confined to small enclosed pockets
in the remaining solvomorphs.

Figure 15 Solvent channels observed in (a) 2d viewed along the
(010) plane and (b) 2e viewed along the a axis. Complex ions and perchlorates are shown in space-fill. Acetonitrile
and toluene solvent molecules are shown in the channels. Hydrogens
are omitted for clarity.

2.3 Variable Temperature Proton NMR
Previous
NMR studies of 1′a and 1b conducted
in highly polar dimethylsulfoxide-d6 only
permitted confirmation of constituents because information obtainable
from multiplet patterns was obscured by broadening.32,33 By contrast, the 1H NMR of 1c in dry CD3CN at 20 °C revealed 1 predominant ligand environment
with 10 distinguishable resonances for the 10 nonexchangeable protons
of L (Figure 16b). Although comparisons between the solution-state spectra
and solid-state structures must always be made carefully, the methylene
and ethylene protons exhibited a strong geminal coupling, which requires
the formation of two chelate rings and a slow intermolecular ligand
exchange on the 1H–1H coupling constant
time scale. Furthermore, 8 of the 10 resonances for nonexchangeable
protons were shifted downfield, which is a common result of the deshielding
influence of σ donation to a metal cation. Resonances found
upfield with respect to the free ligand were associated with Ha and one of the Hh protons. The solid-state structures
of 1′a, 1b, and 1c suggest
that these protons would encounter the shielding influence of ring
current in the [Zn(ZnL)2]2+ complex
cation (Figure S5).42 Therefore, the solution 1H NMR spectrum is fully
consistent with the assignment of the prevalent solution species to
[Zn(ZnL)2]2+.

Figure 16 Variable temperature 1H NMR of 1c in CD3CN at (a) 60, (b)
20, and (c) −40 °C.

The proton NMR of both precipitated 1 and recrystallized 1c in dry CD3CN at 20 °C consistently had
a series of small additional resonances with poorly resolved splitting.
The intensities of these minor spectral features were diminished by
cooling to −40 °C (Figure 16c), suggesting that the predominant species
was subject to limited thermal fragmentation in solution. Furthermore,
the minor resonances collapsed into major resonances, and geminal
splitting was lost reversibly upon heating to 60 °C, indicating
that either intermolecular exchange or intramolecular reorganization
processes were rapid at an elevated temperature (Figure 16a).

In CD3CN solution, the various solvates of 2 isolated in bulk
had identical chemical shifts for the protons of L. Ligand
proton chemical shifts for 2 were within
±0.02 ppm of those observed for 1 with the exception
of the Hh protons, which were somewhat more deshielded
with respect to the free ligand (Figure 17). Significantly, the Hh protons
would be expected to be impacted the most by switching out the central
metal ion of the [Zn(ZnL)2]2+ complex
cation for Hg(II). At 20 °C, the methylene protons of 2 were geminally split by each other and vicinally split by the proton
attached to nitrogen, as observed for 1. Aromatic ligand
protons Hb, Hc, and Hd each had a
single resonance with characteristic multiplicity. However, two partially
resolved doublets for Ha with Δδ 0.026 ppm
in an approximate 1:3 ratio were observed (Figure S6), indicating that there was more than one ligand environment
in a slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale. The meso (ΔΛ)
and diastereotopic (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) forms of 2, characterized crystallographically (vide supra), provide
a satisfactory explanation for the observed spectra. Because the Ha protons of related multidentate pyridyl ligands have typically
demonstrated much greater sensitivity to subtle differences in the
environment when bound to group 12 metal ions, coincidental stereoisomer
chemical shifts for the remaining protons are reasonable (Figure 17c).30,43−45 Significantly, at −40 °C, the two chemical
shift environments for Ha were better resolved, and a second
chemical shift environment was partially resolved for Hh with roughly one-third the intensity of the main Hh resonance
(Figure S7). At an elevated temperature,
the resonances for Ha and all aliphatic protons collapsed
to broad singlets, consistent with a thermally-induced bond cleavage
process permitting interconversion of the stereoisomers.

2.4 ESI-MS
Additional
support for assigning
the major species observed by solution 1H NMR to 1 and 2 was obtained by ESI-MS. The very sensitive
soft ionization technique ESI-MS is well-suited for the characterization
of a mixture of complex ions with different metal-to-ligand ratios.
However, the percentage dissociation is expected to be somewhat higher
in ESI-MS studies, which require significantly lower solution concentrations
than 1H NMR studies. Because of potential differences in
the gas phase-transfer efficiency and detection response factors as
well as dynamic range limitations, our use of ESI-MS has been primarily
qualitative.

2.4.1 ESI-MS Characterization of 1
Solvates of tri-zinc complex 1 were first
prepared before the widespread availability of ESI-MS.32,33 A dilute acetonitrile solution of 1c gave rise to a
positive ion ESI-MS spectrum with five main components (Figure 18a). Under optimized
conditions, a set of peaks with the highest intensity at m/z 432, well-matched with the predicted isotope
pattern for [Zn3L4]2+, was the base peak (Figure 18b), and a set of isotope peaks around m/z 963 matching the theoretical isotope pattern for [Zn3L4ClO4]+ was
also found (Figure 18c). The isolated trinuclear cations underwent chemically induced
dissociation processes 1 and 2 (Figure S8). 1   2

0.1 mM acetonitrile solution of 1. Labeled peak assignments

and E [Zn3L4X]+ (963).
Calculated (top) and observed (bottom) isotope pattern for (b) [Zn3L4]2+ and (c) [Zn3L4ClO4]+.

Significantly, the relative abundance of the peaks
assigned to
mononuclear complexes increased in intensity, whereas peaks assigned
to bi- and trinuclear complexes decreased, with either decreased concentration
or increased capillary voltage as would be expected (data not shown).

2.4.2 ESI-MS Characterization of 2
A dilute acetonitrile solution of 2 gave rise
to a positive ion ESI-MS spectrum with six main components (Figure 19). Under optimized
conditions, the base set of isotope peaks at m/z 500 matched the isotope pattern predicted for the divalent
mixed metal ion [HgZn2L4]2+, and negligible amounts of its homometallic counterparts were detected.
Similarly, a set of isotope peaks with significant abundance around m/z 1099 was well-matched with predictions
for [HgZn2L4ClO4]+; [Zn3L4ClO4]+ had an insignificant intensity. The ESI-MS spectrum
for 2 had peaks for [ZnL]+, [ZnLC2H3N]+, and [Zn2L3]+ in common with the spectrum
for 1 as well as an isotope cluster around m/z 767 assigned to [HgZnL3]+ based on a matching isotope pattern. The isolated divalent
and monovalent trinuclear cations of 2 underwent chemically
induced dissociation processes 3 and 4 (Figure S9), respectively. A detailed investigation of gas-phase fragmentation
pathways to explain why different bimetallic fragments were formed
from these related ions is beyond the scope of this work. 3   4

2.4.3 ESI-MS
Investigation of Metal and Ligand
Redistribution
One of the defining properties of metallothionein
is variable metal occupancy. Our previous ESI-MS studies of [Hg5L6](ClO4)4 (4) revealed elaborate speciation involving [HgnLn+1(ClO4)n−2]+, [HgnLn(ClO4)n−1]+, and [HgnLn–1(ClO4)n]+ ion families.30 Initial
efforts to exchange the central Zn(II) of 1 for Hg(II)
used Hg(ClO4)2. Significantly, the three ions
with Zn/L < 1 that were observed for 1c became undetectable with as little as 0.5 equiv of added Hg(II)
(Figure 20), and monometallic
ions became prevalent (Figure S10), including
a disulfide complex [Zn(L–L)ClO4]+ assigned to m/z 500 based
on the observed charge and isotope pattern (Figure S11). The most prevalent multimetallic species detected with
up to 2 equiv of Hg(ClO4)2 added to 1 had general compositions [M2L2ClO4]+ and [M3L3(ClO4)2]+, and neither [HgZn2L4]2+ nor [HgZn2L4ClO4]+ were evident.
On the basis of these observations, indirect preparation of 2 from 1 and Hg(ClO4)2 was
not attempted.

Lower m/z peaks for monometallic
complexes are omitted (Figure S10).

Our efforts to monitor metal ion
redistribution by ESI-MS were
repeated with precipitated [HgL(ClO4)2] (3). This experiment was expected to provide
better thermodynamic conditions for the desired metal exchange process.
Furthermore, parallels to the metallothionein metal exchange process
were enhanced because the abundance of metal-coordinating molecules
in the biological milieu keeps the concentration of solvated metal
ions very low. In this experiment, the peaks assigned to [Zn3L4]2+ and [Zn3L4(ClO4)2]+ lost
intensity as the ratio of 3 to 1 was increased
(Figure 21). Ions
associated with 2 became prevalent with 1–2 equiv
of added 3 rather than the monometallic species. In addition
to ions with the general compositions [M2L2ClO4]+ and [M3L3(ClO4)2]+, a
peak assigned to [Hg2ZnL4ClO4]+ (m/z 1235)
was also observed, suggesting that two Zn(II) in 1 could
be replaced by Hg(II) (Figure S12a). Significantly,
a meridional octahedral HgL2 site was previously
observed in pentametallic 4.30 Furthermore, the chemically induced dissociation pattern for the
isolated ion was consistent with processes 5 and 6 (Figure S12b). 5   6  Observation of
two fragmentation pathways
is consistent with the location of mercury in both terminal and central
positions, further documenting the facile replacement of Zn(II) by
Hg(II) in thiolate-rich clusters.

Lower m/z peaks for monometallic complexes are omitted.

3 Conclusions
A solvomorphic series of alkylthiolate-bridged HgZn2 complexes with parallels to the metal clusters associated with metallothionein
are reported. Complexes with [Hg(ZnL)2]2+ complex cations were prepared either directly from Hg(II)
and Zn(II) perchlorate salts, ligand, and base or indirectly from
the homometallic [Zn(ZnL)2](ClO4)2 complex and [HgLClO4]. A pair
of pseudoisomorphic Zn3 and HgZn2 complexes
crystallizing in the space group I4̅ confirmed
that very modest structural changes are necessary to accommodate metal
substitution at a thiolate-bridged site. The interplay of hydrogen
bonding and aromatic-packing interactions in bringing lamellar, 2D
lamellar, and columnar arrangements of complex cations in the crystalline
state is evaluated. Solid-state studies were complemented by variable
temperature solution proton NMR and gas-phase ESI-MS studies, suggesting
that both [Zn3L4]2+ and
[HgZn2L4]2+ remained
largely intact in solution at nominally millimolar concentrations.
We believe these findings will be helpful in designing additional
thiolate-bridged clusters modeling the complexity of the metal interaction
with metallothionein.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Materials and General Methods
Organic
solvents and reagents were of commercial grade and used as received.
Metal salts were dried under vacuum overnight. Capillary melting points
were obtained using a Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental
analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. of Norcross, GA.

CAUTION! The perchlorate complexes
included in this work were stable for routine synthesis and purification
procedures. However, caution should be exercised because perchlorate
salts of metal complexes with organic ligands are potentially explosive.46,47

4.2 Instrumental Methods
4.2.1 X-ray
Crystallography
Single crystals
were harvested and then attached to a glass fiber. Data were collected
on a Bruker AXS three-circle APEX DUO diffractometer equipped with
a SMART APEX II CCD detector using φ and ω scans. The
X-ray source used was either a Cu Kα fine focus sealed tube
(1c, 2a, and 2f), Cu Kα
microfocus sealed tube (2e) (λ = 1.54178 Å),
or Mo Kα fine focus sealed tube (λ = 0.71073 Å) (2g and 2d). SADABS was then used to correct the
collected data for Lorentz and polarization effects in addition to
absorption. Intrinsic phasing was used to solve the structures.48 Refinements were made using SHELXL,49 ShelXle,50 and Olex251 software. Additionally, all nonhydrogen atoms
were refined anisotropically, whereas the hydrogen atomic positions
on the bonded carbons were fixed isotropically with regard to thermal
parameters. To model the solvent disorder in 2d, occupancies
were refined, and then some were fixed. Selected crystallographic
data are given in Table 4. Selected structural parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Mercury 3.9 was used to generate packing diagrams.52

4.2.2 Powder
Diffraction
Powder diffraction
analysis was carried out on the instrument described above. Samples
were ground and prepared as mulls using Parabar 10312 oil. Three 180
s frames were collected, covering 2θ of 8°–70°.
Frames were merged using the SMART APEX II software53 and were further processed using DIFFRAC-Plus and EVA software.54

4.2.3 Solution Proton NMR
Proton NMR
spectra were collected in 5 mm outside diameter NMR tubes on an Agilent
400MR DD2 NMR spectrometer operating in the pulse Fourier transform
mode. Calibrated autopipettes were used to prepare solutions that
were nominally 2–5 mM for variable temperature NMR measurements
by dissolution of elementally analyzed complexes. The sample temperature
was maintained by blowing chilled nitrogen over the NMR tube in the
probe. Proton chemical shifts were measured relative to the internal
solvent but are reported relative to tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants
are reported in hertz. Line—fitting analyses were performed
with Acorn NMR Utility Transform Software.55

4.2.4 ESI-MS
ESI-MS spectra were obtained
on a LCQ-DECA ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo) equipped with an
ESI source. Dilute solutions (nominally 5 × 10–4 M) in acetonitrile were directly infused into the ESI source at
a flow rate of 10 μL/min. Ion-focusing conditions were optimized
to maximize the ion signal while maintaining a capillary voltage as
low as possible to minimize dissociation of metal/ligand complexes
upon ionization and transfer to the ion trap. Similar ionization conditions
routinely produce intact noncovalent cluster ions in our instrument.
MS/MS spectra were obtained by isolating the parent ion at qz = 0.250, with isolation widths
adjusted to isolate the entire isotopic distribution of the complex.
Parent ions are allowed to undergo collision-induced dissociation
with the background helium buffer gas at various activation amplitudes
in the range of 10–30% (normalized collision energy). Spectra
were recorded in the positive ion mode. No ions were detected in the
negative ion mode. Reported assignments were based on both qualitative
isotope pattern matching56 and collision-induced
dissociation patterns.

H, 4.17; N, 10.54. Found: C, 36.27; H, 4.20; N, 10.49%.

4.3.3 Preparation of [Zn(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2·2CH3CN (1c)
Recrystallization of 1 (50 mg, 44 μmol)
from acetonitrile/toluene by slow evaporation
provided 1c (8.4 mg, 7.3 μmol). NMR is identical
to that of 1. Homogeneity of crystalline material was
confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S1). mp 177 °C (dec.). Anal. Calcd for C36H50Cl2N10O8S4Zn3: C, 37.72; H, 4.40; N, 12.23. Found: C, 37.91; H,
4.44; N, 12.20%.

4.3.4 Preparation of [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2 (2)
A mixture of Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O (485 mg, 1.3 mmol) and Hg(ClO4)2·3H2O (295 mg, 0.65 mmol) in 15 mL of water was added dropwise
over 30 min to a solution of NaOH (100 mg, 2.6 mmol) and L (436 mg, 2.6 mmol) in 40 mL of water. A white solid started forming
about halfway through addition of the metal mixture. The suspension
was stirred briefly. A white solid was collected by vacuum filtration
and dried under vacuum overnight. The anhydrous precipitate was amorphous.
A crystalline phase with the powder pattern matching that of 2a coprecipitated in some preps (Figure S2). 1H NMR (nominally 2 mM, CD3CN, 20
°C): δ 8.085 (m, 1H, Ha), 7.953 (dd, 1H, J = 7.8, 7.8 Hz, Hc), 7.519 (d, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz, Hd), 7.352 (dd, 1H, J = 7.8,

32.04; H, 3.70; N, 9.35. Found: C, 31.97; H, 3.76; N, 9.19%.

4.3.5 Preparation of [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2·2H2O (2a)
Recrystallization of precipitate 2 (50 mg,
40 μmol) from acetonitrile/toluene by slow
evaporation initially provided colorless plates of 2a. Yield: 15 mg (12 μmol, 30%). mp 179 °C (dec.). NMR was
indistinguishable from that of 2. Homogeneity of crystalline
material was confirmed by PXRD (Figure S2). Anal. Calcd for C32H48Cl2HgN8O10S4Zn2: C, 31.12; H, 3.92;
N, 9.07. Found: C, 31.05; H, 3.92; N, 8.95%.

4.3.6 Preparation
of [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2·3CH3CN·0.75Toluene (2d)
Colorless needles
of 2d were obtained in trace quantities by further slow
evaporation of the 2a mother liquor or by slow diffusion
of an acetonitrile solution of 2 into toluene. The crystals
were unstable to loss of the solvent, turning opaque after a short
time in air. Crystals transferred to oil immediately after removal
of the mother liquor had sufficient integrity for single-crystal diffraction.
NMR was same as that of 2 with addition of toluene peaks.

4.3.7 Preparation of [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2·CH3CN·1.5Toluene
(2e)
Very fine colorless
needles of 2e were grown by further slow evaporation
of the 2d mother liquor or by slow diffusion of an acetonitrile
solution of 2 into toluene. The crystal quality deteriorated
rapidly upon removal of the mother liquor even with immediate transfer
to oil. NMR was same as that of 2a with addition of toluene
peaks. Anal. Calcd for C35.5H48Cl2HgN8O8S4Zn2 (corresponding
to 0.5toluene solvate): C, 34.23; H, 3.89; N, 9.00. Found: C, 34.41;
H, 3.85; N, 8.83%.

4.3.8 Preparation of [HgL(ClO4)] (3)
An amorphous
precipitate of 3 was prepared as reported previously.301H NMR (nominally 2 mM, CD3CN, 20
°C): δ 8.58 (d, 1H, J = 5 Hz, Ha), 8.03 (dd, 1H, J = 8, 8 Hz, Hc), 7.60
(dd, 1H, J = 8, 5 Hz, Hb), 7.55 (d, 1H, J = 8 Hz, Hd), 4.33 (br s, 3H, He,
He), 3.24 (m, 4H, Hg, Hg). Anal.
Calcd for C8H11ClHgN2O4S: C, 20.56; H, 2.37; N, 5.99. Found: C, 20.82; H, 2.33; N, 6.00%.

4.3.9 Preparation of [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2·CH3CN·0.5Toluene
(2f)
An acetonitrile solution
of 1 (33 mg, 31 μmol) was mixed with an acetonitrile
solution of 3 (15 mg, 32 μmol) and diluted with
toluene for slow evaporation. Colorless X-ray quality plates of 2f and 1c cocrystallized in low yield. Morphological
differences between the crystals were insufficient for manual separation.

4.3.10 Preparation of [Hg(ZnL2)2](ClO4)2·Toluene (2g)
A 1:1 acetonitrile solution of 1 (33 mg,
31 μmol) and 3 (13 mg, 32 μmol)
was slowly diffused into toluene. Colorless X-ray quality plates of 2f, 2g, and 1c cocrystallized in
low yield. Morphological differences between 2f and 2g were insufficient for bulk separation.
