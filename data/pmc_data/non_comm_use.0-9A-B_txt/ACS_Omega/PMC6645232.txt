In
this study, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified γ-alumina
nanoparticles were utilized to improve the copper removal efficiency
of polyethersulfone (PES) membranes. Alumina nanoparticles were first
modified by APTES silane coupling agent before impregnating into PES
composite membranes. The PES membranes were fabricated by incorporating
three different amounts of modified nanoparticles by a phase inversion
process. The prepared membranes were characterized using field emission
scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis, water
contact angle, water flux, and porosity measurements. The Cu(II) removal
and adsorption capacity of the membranes were also analyzed. The addition
of nanoparticles increased the thermal stability, hydrophilicity,
total porosity, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area,
and glass transition temperature of the membranes. TGA confirmed a
suitable uptake of the nanoparticles during the membrane fabrication
process. The water permeation of the membranes also increased significantly.
Membranes synthesized with 4 wt % nanoparticles showed the highest
rejection for copper ions of 87%. Adsorption isotherms were tested
using Langmuir and Freundlich models, where the Freundlich isotherm
model resulted in the best fitting.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heavy metal ions are among
the most dangerous water pollutants,
even at low concentrations. Although copper is considered to be a
vital micronutrient for humans, excess accumulation of copper in the
human body poses a dangerous health risk and may cause headache, depression,
nausea, learning problems, and kidney and liver damage.1,2 Currently, several physiochemical and biological approaches, such
as precipitation, coagulation, adsorption, ion exchange, biological
treatment, and membrane processes, are employed to remove heavy metals
from polluted waters.3 Among these methods,
adsorption is the most widely used mechanism because of its high effectiveness,
low cost, and versatility.4,5

Nanostructured
materials, usually in the form of inorganic nanoparticles,
are known as efficient adsorbents because of their high specific surface
area and high chemical affinity toward heavy metals.6 However, difficulty in regeneration and separation of nano-adsorbents
from treated water remains a challenging issue.4,7 Incorporating
nano-adsorbents into porous polymeric materials has been shown to
be a promising approach to address the aforementioned issue and improve
the removal efficiency of the membranes.7−9 The membranes themselves
might also act as the auxiliary adsorbent in enhancing the overall
adsorption capacity.7

Different types
of nanoparticles have been utilized to improve
the heavy metal ions removal performance of membranes,10 of which metal oxide nanoparticles have shown
the most promising results.11−13 Metal oxide nanoparticles, such
as MnO2,3,11 ZrO2,14 and Fe3O4,1,9,12,15 have been
extensively utilized to synthesize nanocomposite membranes in order
to improve the membrane performance for the removal of heavy metal
ions from water. Among these nanoparticles, aluminum oxide (alumina)
is one of the most promising adsorbents because of its high affinity
toward heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions.4,16−18 A majority of the research on impregnating polymeric
membranes with alumina nanoparticles has been focused on flux improvement
and fouling mitigation.14,19−21 Although many studies investigated the use of alumina nanoparticles
in polyethersulfone (PES) membranes for the removal of contaminants,
such as dye and nitrate,22−24 only few studies investigated
the use of alumina/PES membranes for the removal of heavy metal ions
from water.7

Recently, the incorporation
of modified nanoparticles into polymeric
materials has attracted great interests. One common method to modify
the nanoparticles is treating them by silane coupling agents, such
as methacryloyloxy methylenemethyl diethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES).25,26 Silane coupling agents are extensively used
in inorganic polymer composites such as mineral-filled polymer composites.27,28 Choosing the appropriate silane group can modify the surface of
an inorganic material from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, increase its
affinity to the functional groups of the polymer matrix,29,30 and decrease the agglomeration of nanoparticles.31

In this study, alumina nanoparticles, treated by
APTES, are used
to fabricate novel PES membranes to remove Cu(II) ions from water.
The morphology and physiochemical properties of the modified nanoparticles
and membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM), dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), porosity, and water contact
angle (WCA). The performance of the membranes was tested in terms
of Cu(II) ion removal from water as well as pure water flux (PWF)
measurements.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 IR Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The modification
of alumina with APTES occurs by the reaction of the hydroxyl groups
of Al2O3 nanoparticles with the silane functional
group of APTES.25 To investigate the modification
efficiency of the nanoparticles, FTIR spectroscopy was used. The IR
spectra of nonmodified γ-alumina nanoparticles and APTES modified
nanoparticles are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 IR spectra of the modified and nonmodified alumina nanoparticles.

The broad adsorption peak in the
range of 980–1220 cm–1 corresponds to Al–O–Si
and Si–O–Si
bonds of the silane coupling agent. The frequency of Al–O–Al
bonds in the alumina structure is also in this range.27 The wide peak in the range of 3000–3550 cm–1 can be assigned to O–H bond and adsorbed water on Al2O3 surface.25,27,32 APTES modified nanoparticles display two additional bands at 1600
and 2950 cm–1. The peak at 1600 cm–1 can be attributed to the N–H vibrations, indicating the presence
of R–NH2 groups at the surface of modified nanoparticles.32 Also the peak at 2950 cm–1 can be assigned to C–H stretching vibrations.33 These results confirm the presence of the silane
coupling agent at the surface of the treated nanoparticles.

2.2 Membrane Characterization
The presence
of alumina nanoparticles in the membrane structure was confirmed by
XRD analysis. The XRD spectra of neat PES membrane and PES/alumina
nanocomposite membranes are shown in Figure 2. As it can be seen, the PES polymer is primarily
amorphous and shows one main peak at 2θ = 18.2°, which
is similar to the reported peak for pure PES.34 For the alumina/PES nanocomposite membranes, two new peaks at 2θ
= 46° and 68° were observed. These peaks are characteristic
of γ-alumina.35 This proves the presence
of γ-alumina nanoparticles in the PES membrane matrix. These
results show that the γ-alumina nanoparticles have been distributed
into the polymer matrix, and also, with the addition of nanoparticles,
the nano-enhanced membranes remained amorphous.

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction patterns
of neat PES membranes and PES/alumina
nanocomposite membranes.

The glass transition temperature of the membranes (Tg) was measured using a DMA. The glass transition
temperature
depicts the transition of the polymer from glassy behavior to rubbery
state, which results in a considerable decrease in the stiffness of
the polymer.36 The Tg of the membranes can be determined from the peak of the loss
modulus. As it can be seen in Figure 3, adding nanoparticles into the polymer membranes shifts
the maximum peak of the loss modulus to higher temperatures. For the
neat polymeric membrane (M 0), the glass transition temperature was
determined as 218 °C. The nanocomposite membranes showed significantly
higher glass transition temperatures, which were 224, 233, and 244
°C for M 3, M 4, and M 5 samples, respectively. The presence
of the modified nanoparticles in the polymer matrix makes interfacial
strong bonds between the polymer matrix and the nanoparticles and
also restricts the movement of the polymeric chain.36 This explains the increase in the glass transition temperature
by incorporating nanoparticles.

Figure 3 Loss modulus vs temperature for the control
and nanocomposite membranes.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to confirm the
distribution
of the alumina nanoparticles and evaluate the thermal stability of
the fabricated membranes. Figure 4 shows the TGA curves for neat polymeric and composite
membranes. TGA curves for the composite membranes show a small shift
compared to neat PES membranes, which indicates that the thermal stability
of PES membranes containing alumina nanoparticles was enhanced. The
residual weight ratios for M 3, M 4, and M 5 samples are 9.8, 14.2,
and 17.5%, respectively. Comparing the residual weight ratios with
the nominal concentration of nanoparticles in the membranes, that
is, 14% (M 3), 18% (M 4), and 21% (M 5), indicates that the nanoparticles
were reasonably distributed in the polymer matrix.37 However, some amount of alumina particles leached out to
the coagulation bath during the membrane formation.

Figure 4 TGA curves for the nanocomposite
and neat polymer membranes.

Figure 5 presents
the FESEM images of the cross section of the synthesized membranes.
The cross sections of the membranes show a typical asymmetric structure
consisting of a thin dense layer supported by a large finger-like
sublayer. Also, large macro-voids are formed beneath the finger-like
pores. This structure contributes to the higher flux of the membrane
while also maintaining its salute rejection, as discussed in the following
sections. In addition, it can be seen that the nanocomposite membranes
contain slightly larger macro-voids in the sublayer compared to neat
PES membranes, which is in accordance with the total porosity and
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area results (Table 2). Generally, the
growth of sublayer macro-voids leads to a higher total porosity.

Figure 5 SEM cross-sectional
images of (a) M 0, (b) M 3, (c) M 4, and (d)
M 5 membranes.

The total porosity, presented
in Table 1, shows that
the nanocomposite membranes
possess higher total porosity compared to neat PES membranes. The
membrane porosity increased with increasing the nanoparticle amounts
in the matrix from 66% for neat polymeric membranes to 82% in the
case of M 5 samples. It has been reported that the interaction between
nanoparticles and the polymer solution leads to easier diffusion of
solvent molecules from the polymer matrix to the coagulation bath.15,38 In addition, the diffusion rate of the solvent [dimethylacetamide
(DMAc)] from the membrane into the coagulation bath can also increase
through the addition of nanoparticles.39 As a result, the nanocomposite membranes have a higher amount of
total porosity as well as BET surface area compared to the neat polymeric
membrane.

and PWF of the Membranes

The BET surface area of the
membranes, shown in Table 2, increased from 20.6 cm2/g for
neat polymeric
membrane to 35.5 cm2/gr for M 3 samples. This can be explained
by the presence and dispersion of nanoparticles with high surface
area in the membrane structure. Figure 6c confirms the suitable dispersion of alumina nanoparticles
in the matrix of the membranes. The uniform distribution of the nanoparticles
is favorable because it increases the contact area of the passing
water through the membrane and the surface of the particles, which
subsequently increases the surface adsorption of the copper ions.
Interestingly, M 5 samples exhibit less amount of surface area compared
to M 4 and M 3 samples. This can be attributed to the agglomeration
of the nanoparticles, as depicted in Figure 6b. Agglomeration may also lead to blocking
of some pores in the structure and consequently lowering the available
surface area of the membranes.

Contact angle measurement is a commonly used
method to characterize
the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of membranes.1 High contact angles indicate that the membrane is more
hydrophobic and vice versa for lower contact angles. Table 1 shows the WCA of the PES membranes
decreasing from 69° to 44° with increasing the nanoparticle
amount in the matrix. The hydroxyl content of the membrane surface
increases because of the incorporation of alumina nanoparticles into
the membrane surface, leading to increased hydrophilicity of the membrane
surface.40

2.3 Adsorption
Study
Figure 7 shows the equilibrium adsorption
of Cu(II) versus time for the membranes synthesized in this work.
The results show that by increasing the alumina concentration in the
membranes, the adsorption capacity increases significantly. The highest
Cu(II) adsorption capacity of each membrane was 18.7, 24.7, and 31.8
mg/g for M 3, M 4, and M 5 membranes, respectively. The increase in
the adsorption capacity of the membranes can be attributed to the
increased number of active sites for the adsorption of copper ions
as a result of increasing the amount of alumina in the membranes,
as well as the increased surface area of the membranes.

Figure 7 Equilibrium
adsorption of the membranes as a function of time (initial
copper concentration = mg/L).

Langmuir and Freundlich equilibrium adsorption isotherms
were applied
to the adsorption data. Table 2 presents the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm parameters
for Cu(II) adsorption on the nano-enhanced membranes. Langmuir isotherm,
which indicates a monolayer adsorption on homogenous adsorption sites,
is expressed by eq 1 1  where qe is the
equilibrium adsorption (mg/g), Ce is the
equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase (g/L), qmax is the adsorption capacity (mg/g), and b is the equilibrium constant (L/mg).

The Freundlich isotherm
corresponds to a multilayer adsorption
on a heterogeneous surface and is formulated by eq 2 2  where k and n are the relative adsorption constant
and adsorption intensity parameter,
respectively. On the basis of the obtained data, the Freundlich model
showed a better fit with the equilibrium data (R2 = 0.99), which indicates a multilayer coverage and heterogeneous
adsorption on the membrane surface.

2.4 Filtration
Performance
The results
of membrane performance to remove Cu(II) are shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that neat
PES membranes exhibit the lowest amount of copper removal, whereas
the membranes containing 4 wt % of alumina nanoparticles (M 4) exhibit
the highest Cu(II) at 87%. The dispersed modified alumina nanoparticles
in the polymer matrix act as active sites to adsorb copper ions and
prevent copper ions from passing through the membrane.7,17,41

Figure 8 Copper removal (%) from aqueous solution
for PES and nano-enhanced
membranes.

However, the nanocomposite membranes
with the highest content of
nanoparticles (M 5) showed lower copper removal compared to M 4 because
of the agglomeration of the nanoparticles, discussed earlier. Because
the adsorption of the copper ions on the surface of alumina nanoparticles
is the main mechanism for copper removal, dispersion of the nanoparticles
in the polymer matrix plays an important role in the membrane performance.
Agglomeration of nanoparticles decreases the effectiveness of the
nano-enhanced membranes by decreasing the available surface area of
the nanoparticles, leading to the lower rejection performance.7,12 This is in accordance with the decreased available BET surface area
of the M 5 sample.

The PWF along with WCAs of the membranes
are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen
that the membranes with a higher amount of nanoparticles exhibit higher
flux and lower WCAs. This can be explained by the combination of the
increased hydrophilicity of the surface at lower surface contact angles
and the higher porosity of the membranes with higher nanoparticles
content. Several studies have reported an increase in water flux through
the membranes because of the increased hydrophilicity, porosity, and
the mean pore size of membranes incorporating nanoparticles.14,42,43 However, by increasing the nanoparticles
amount from 4 to 5 wt %, the PWF decreased because of the agglomeration
of the nanoparticles. Agglomeration of nanoparticles in the membranes
can lead to the blocking of the surface pores and result in lower
permeability in accordance with similar results reported by others.7,12,44

Figure 9 PWF and WCA of the synthesized membranes.

It should be noted that reverse
osmosis and nanofiltration have
been investigated and used extensively to remove heavy metal ions
from water. Although these techniques are able to remove heavy metals
from water very efficiently, high operational pressure, high energy
consumption, and low flux are the main drawbacks of these systems.45 The developed nanocomposite membrane in this
study is an attempt to mitigate these issues. The synthesized membranes
combine adsorption and membrane technology, and because the pore size
is bigger than nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, the operational
pressure is very lower and the water flux is higher.

2.5 Reusability
The membrane with the
best performance of copper removal in the filtration experiment (M
4) was chosen for the usability study. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) was utilized as a cleaning agent because it has been reported
that it is able to permanently remove copper ions from membrane adsorption
sites because of the high formation constant of [Cu(EDTA)]2–.7 As it can be seen in Figure 10, the M 4 membrane can be
reused after 4 cycles with only 5% reduction of copper removal (compared
to initial copper removal capability). This confirms that the performance
of synthesized membranes in copper removal was not reduced significantly,
even after four cycles of filtration process.

for four sequential runs.

3 Conclusions
APTES modified alumina
nanoparticles (γ-Al2O3) were incorporated
in PES membranes to enhance the removal
of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The morphology and performance
of the nanocomposite membranes were analyzed extensively. It was revealed
that by adding the modified nanoparticles to the PES membranes, the
hydrophilicity, total porosity, BET surface area, thermal stability,
and glass transition temperature were all improved. The combination
of higher porosity and lower hydrophobicity of the membrane surface
led to a significantly higher water flux. Moreover, the copper ion
removal increased from 11%, in the case of neat polymer membranes,
to 87% for the nanocomposite membrane containing 4 wt % of modified
alumina nanoparticles. Batch adsorption studies showed that the adsorption
of copper ions on the membranes fits the Freundlich model, which corresponds
to heterogeneous adsorption sites.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
PES (Ultrason E6020P, 58 000
g/mol, BASF Company, Germany) was used as the base polymer. Polyvinyl
pyrrolidone (PVP) with a 25 000 g/mol molecular weight and
DMAc were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles with a surface area of 58 m2/g were
purchased from U.S. Research Nanomaterials (Texas, USA). APTES was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was used for surface modification
of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. Copper nitrate
(Cu(NO3)2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and was used to prepare feed solutions containing specific concentration
of Cu(II). Necessary dilutions were performed with Milli-Q water having
resistivity higher than 18 MΩ cm.

4.2 Surface
Modification of Alumina Nanoparticles
To increase the stability
of the nanoparticles in the casting solution,
surface modification of alumina nanoparticles with APTES silane coupling
agent was carried out. Certain amounts of alumina nanoparticles were
added to anhydrous ethanol under nitrogen purging followed by 60 and
30 min bath and probe sonication. Subsequently, 4 wt % of APTES was
added to the mixture under nitrogen atmosphere. After stirring for
6 h at 70 °C, the particles were separated from the solution
by centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 20 min. Finally, the Al2O3 particles were dried in an oven for 24 h at
50 °C.

4.3 FTIR Study
FTIR
spectroscopy was
used to confirm the chemical modification of alumina nanoparticles.
FTIR spectra of APTES modified alumina nanoparticles and nonmodified
alumina nanoparticles were measured using Bruker Eco-ATR spectrophotometer
from 4000 to 400 cm–1. Each spectrum was captured
by averaging 400 scans with a resolution of 2 cm–1.

4.4 Preparation of PES/Alumina Mixed Matrix Membranes
Table 3 shows the
compositions of doped solutions prepared to fabricate nanocomposite
membranes. PES flat membranes were synthesized by phase inversion
via the immersion precipitation method. A homogenous mixture of alumina
nanoparticles and DMAc was prepared by adding predetermined amounts
of nanoparticles into the DMAc and sonication for 1 h. Afterward,
measured amounts of PES and PVP were dissolved into the mixture while
stirring at 400 rpm for 24 h. Finally, the solutions were mixed by
an acoustic mixer for 1 h before casting.

Table 3 Compositions
of the Casting Solutions

M 0	18	1	81	0	
M 3	18	1	78	3	
M 4	18	1	77	4	
M 5	18	1	76	5	
The solutions were cast onto
a glass substrate at room temperature
with a thickness of 200 μm using the doctor blade technique
and an automatic film applicator at a speed of 60 mm/s. The casting
was subsequently moved into distilled water and stored for 24 h. The
prepared membranes were washed and dried between two sheets of filter
paper and subsequently vacuum dried for 24 h at 50 °C.

4.5 Static Cu(II) Adsorption Study
Batch
adsorption tests were performed to calculate the static adsorption
of Cu(II) ions on the PES/alumina mixed matrix membranes. Copper solutions
with different initial concentrations in the range of 20–80
mg/L were prepared by dissolving Cu(NO3)2 in
deionized water. The tests were carried out by adding 0.05 g of sliced
membranes into vessels containing 100 mL of Cu(II) solutions. The
vessels were then placed in a shaker and agitated at room temperature
for 48 h. The equilibrium concentration of Cu(II) in the solutions
was determined by a flame atomic adsorption spectrometer (ICE 3000
Thermo Fisher). The copper ion adsorption of the membranes (mg/g)
were calculated by eq 3 3  where qe is the
equilibrium adsorbed amount of copper ion per membrane weight (mg/g), C0 and Ce are the
initial and equilibrium concentrations (mg/L) of Cu(II) in the solution, V is the volume of the copper solution (L), and Mm is the mass of the membrane (g).

4.6 Membrane Characterization
4.6.1 XRD
Analysis
To determine the crystal
phase composition of the alumina nanoparticles, PES, and alumina/PES
membranes, XRD analysis was conducted using an Advance Bruker-D8 Discover
diffractometer (Kα1 = 1.5406 Å, 2θ range
from 5° to 80°). The detector was LYNXEYE-XE operating at
an accelerating voltage of 40.0 kV and emission current of 40.0 mA.

4.6.2 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
Dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA) is a useful technique to measure the glass
transition temperature of the membranes. Neat polymeric and nanocomposite
membranes were investigated using a TA Instruments Q800 dynamic mechanical
analyzer. A preload of 0.005 N was applied to keep the samples flat
during the test. The membrane samples were heated at the rate of 3
°C min–1 from 25 to 280 °C while oscillating
at a frequency of 1 Hz at an amplitude of 10 μm. Glass transition
temperature of the synthesized membranes were determined from the
peak of the loss modulus.

4.6.3 TGA Thermal Analysis
To investigate
the thermal stability and dispersion of the alumina nanoparticles
in the membranes, TGA was conducted under air atmosphere over a temperature
range of 25–1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

4.6.4 Contact Angle Measurements
The
contact angle of the prepared membranes was measured using a contact
angle measuring instrument (Rame-Hart goniometer model 250). Sessile
droplet method and image analysis of the droplet on the surface were
used to measure the equilibrium WCA. A 6 μL water droplet was
deposited on the membrane surface and the contact angle was measured
after 5 s. The contact angle was measured at three different points
on the membrane surface and the average value was reported.

4.6.5 Membrane Porosity
In order to determine
the total porosity of the synthesized membranes, membrane samples
were cut to a certain dimension and soaked in distilled water for
24 h. The surface of the membrane samples was wiped with filter paper
and the samples were immediately weighed. After that, the membranes
were dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 24 h and weighed again.

The total porosity of the synthesized membranes was determined
by the following equation 4  where Ww and Wd are the
weights of wet and dry membranes (g),
and ρw and V are water density (g/cm3) and membrane pieces volume (cm3), respectively.
The results were reported as an average number of three measurements
for each membrane sample.

4.6.6 BET Surface Area
The gas adsorption–desorption
technique was used to measure the surface area of the synthesized
membranes. Nitrogen sorption analyses were obtained with a surface-area
analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) using standard continuous procedures
at 77.15 K on the membrane samples that had been degassed at 333 K
under a high vacuum for 6 h. The surface area was calculated according
to the BET model over a relative pressure range of 0.05–0.90.

4.6.7 Scanning Electron Microscopy
FESEM
(Hitachi, S-8400) was used to analyze the morphology of the membranes.
In order to minimize the stress on the sample and prevent deformation
of the membrane cross section and pore structure during fracturing,
a modified freeze fracture method (Cryo-snap method) was used to break
the samples. In this method, the specimen is embedded into ice before
breaking.46 The dried cut samples were
iridium sputtered and were investigated under the microscope at 5
kV.

4.6.8 Filtration Process
Water flux of
the membranes was measured using a batch-type dead-end stirred cell
(Millipore, UFSC05001) at a fixed speed of 400 rpm. The effective
area of the membrane in the filtration cell was 13.4 cm2. Prior to the water flux determination, the membrane sample was
first pressurized at 4 bar for 1 h to minimize compaction effects.
After compaction, transmembrane pressure was set to 3.5 bar and the
permeate flux was calculated by eq 5 5  where Q, A, and Δt are the quantity of permeate (kg),
membrane area (m2), and sampling time (h), respectively.

In order to evaluate the membrane performance in removing Cu(II)
from water, feed solutions containing initial Cu(II) concentration
of 20 mg/L were employed. The permeate was collected every 10 min
and its concentration was measured. Copper ion removal was calculated
using eq 6 6  where Cp and CF are the copper ion concentrations (mg/L) in
the permeate and feed, respectively.

4.6.9 Membrane
Usability
The membrane
with the best performance was chosen for reusability test. The membrane
used for copper removal test was regenerated by dipping and stirring
for 1 h in the 10 mM EDTA solution.12 Then
the membrane was washed with plenty of deionized water and reused
for the filtration test. This procedure were repeated four times with
the duration of 100 min for each filtration cycle.
