Palladium nanoparticles (NPs) are
decorated on the surface of an
amine-functionalized graphene oxide (Pd@APGO) and characterized by
using various analytical techniques. In this methodology, the surface
of graphene oxide is modified using the amine functional groups which
help stabilization and distribution of Pd NPs very well and increases
the surface electron density of NPs by electron donating from amine
groups. This developed catalyst shows a high catalytic activity toward
the Suzuki coupling and carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura coupling
reactions at mild reaction conditions. The amine on the graphene oxide
plays a very crucial role to stabilize and increase the electron density
of Pd NPs and prevents the leaching of Pd metals. The Pd@APGO catalyst
showed excellent catalytic activity (>90%) with a large range of
substrates
for both of the reactions and provides five recycle runs without the
loss of its activity.

Introduction
In
recent years, the use of nanocatalysts [nanoparticle (NPs)]
has been a rapidly growing area because of their excellent efficiency
and selectivity in catalysis.1−3 The inimitable properties and
the enhanced performances of nanomaterials depend on their sizes,
shapes, and supports. The combination of metal NPs with a proper support
of choice gives a vast scope for the discovery of innovative and highly
active catalysts which have industrial importance. Several systems
have been established to immobilize palladium on a wide range of solid
supports, such as microporous polymers,2−4 mesoporous silica,5−9 amorphous silica,10,11 magnetic material,5−12 and carbon nanofibers.13,14 However, a limited
development of catalytic activity was found and recognized to the
mass transfer control. Hence, there is a quick need to develop more
efficient catalysts with proper support.

Among the various supports
studied, the graphene oxide (GO) and
functionalized GO get intense attention because of the unique structural
and surface properties.15 Additionally,
GO has the high surface area and the presence of abundant oxygen-containing
functionalities such as phenolic, carboxylic which are tunable in
nature.16−21 In particular, much attention has been focused on the amine-functionalized
materials because the amines are well-recognized to stabilize metal
NPs, avoid the aggregation of NPs without disturbing their appropriate
properties, and are also anticipated to increase the catalytic activity
of NPs.22−25 Recently, Bäckvall et al. immobilized Pd NPs on amine-functionalized
aminopropyl (AmP)-functionalized siliceous mesocellular foam (Pd0-AmPMCF).26 This Pd0-AmPMCF catalyst shows high catalytic
activities toward the Suzuki cross-couplings and hydrogenation of
alkenes,27 in racemization of the amines,26 aerobic oxidation alcohols,28 and in selective transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes
to anilines.29 Jones and co-workers utilized
amino polymer-silica composites containing amine functional group
to support the Pd metal, and this material’s high catalytic
activity toward the selective hydrogenation of alkynes.30 Very recently, Yang et al. synthesized amine-rich
silica hollow nanospheres and utilized for the quinoline hydrogenation
reaction.31

A wide variety of coupling
reactions such as Heck,32 Suzuki,33 and Sonogashira34 reactions have been efficiently studied by the
supported metal catalysts. Among them, the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling
reaction of aryl halides with aryl boronic acids is the most popular
method for the construction of the unsymmetrical biaryls structures.
Biaryls have attracted enormous interest because they are used as
important units in molecular components, such as pharmaceuticals,
natural products, herbicides, and in engineering materials, such as
conducting polymers, molecular wires, and liquid crystals.35 Traditionally, for the Suzuki coupling reaction,
homogeneous palladium/phosphine complexes have been utilized,36 which are generally toxic, unstable in moisture
and air, rarely recoverable and expensive in nature. Still, Pd catalysts
with phosphine-free heterogeneous Pd catalysts with green alternatives
to the conventional homogeneous ones are needed.

By envisioning
the high surface area and functional nature of GO,
the property of amine functional group toward the stabilization and
distribution of NPs offers an increased catalytic activity of metal
NPs. Herein, by considering the electron-donating and coordination
properties of amine to metal NPs,37,38 we synthesized,
characterized Pd NPs on amine-functionalized GO39 and utilized for the Suzuki and carbonylative coupling
reactions.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Catalyst
The
overall synthetic
procedure of Pd@APGO (see the Experimental Section and the Supporting Information for a detailed procedure)
is shown below (Figure 1). The as-synthesized Pd@APGO catalyst was characterized by using
various analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM images of the synthesized Pd@APGO catalyst
showed the well-organized distribution of Pd NPs on the surface of
the amine-functionalized GO (Figure 2). The surface of GO with amine functional group helps
for the stabilization of NPs. When only GO was used instead of the
amine-functionalized ones for the deposition of Pd NPs, the agglomerated
distribution of Pd NPs on the surface of GO was found (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Then, the
synthesized material was characterized by using TEM analysis, which
showed that the spherical Pd NPs are well-distributed on the surface
of the amine-functionalized GO. The average particle size of Pd NPs
ranges from 4 to 10 nm (Figure 3). The particle size distribution was calculated, and it was
observed that the maximum particle sizes were 7 nm, mainly 8 and 9
nm (Supporting Information S2). Next, XPS
was performed to measure the elemental composition. The overall XPS
spectrum shows the presence of all of the expected elements such as
C, N, O, Si, and Pd (Figure 4a). The Pd0 state of the Pd metal was further confirmed by
the XPS peak at 334.55 eV (Figure 4b).

Application of Pd@APGO
for the Suzuki Coupling Reaction
The prepared Pd@APGO catalyst
was then investigated for the carbon–carbon
bond formation reactions. The Suzuki cross-coupling reaction was selected,
as it is one of the central reactions from a viewpoint of its versatile
applications. For an effective cross-coupling, the use of basic conditions
is effective. The iodobenzene and phenylboronic acids were utilized
for the optimization of reaction conditions (Table 1). Initially, we have studied the effect
of various solvents (Table 1, entries 1–6). The use of nonpolar solvent such as
toluene provided a good yield of biphenyl (Table 1, entry 1). Then, a series of polar solvents
such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and acetonitrile were investigated,
and they were also found to be effective and provided good yields
of biphenyls (Table 1, entries 2–4). Then, the use of water provided a lower yield
of biphenyl (Table 1, entry 5). The use of a polar protic solvent such as ethanol was
investigated, and a good yield was noted (Table 1, entry 6). Next, the effect of a binary
mixture of solvents containing polar/nonpolar (water/toluene) and
polar/polar was investigated, and it was found that the.

A polar/polar mixture provides an excellent yield of biphenyls
(Table 1, entry 7–8).
Next, we investigated the effect of a base on the reaction system;
the use of inorganic bases such as Na2CO3, Cs2CO3, and NaOAc provided good yields of biaryls
(Table 1, entries 9–11).
Whereas the use of organic bases such as Et3N and DABCO
also provides good to moderate yields of biaryls (1, entries 12–13). Then, the effect of temperature on
the reaction was investigated; it was found that by decreasing the
reaction temperature below 80 °C, the yield of biaryls decreased
(Table 1, entries 14–16).
To investigate the catalytic activity of the catalyst because of the
presence of amine functional groups, the Pd@APGO(a) catalyst was synthesized
(Supporting Information S3b). By decreasing
the percentage of amine up to half level, a decreased yield of biaryls
was noted (Table 1,
entry 17). Next, a comparative study of the developed Pd@APGO catalyst
with other catalysts was done (Table 1, entry 18–21). Next, for the comparative study,
the Pd NPs supported on the bare GO (Pd@GO) were also tested for the
coupling reaction, and it was found that Pd@GO exhibited a lower activity
(72%) than the Pd@APGO catalyst. This indicates that the presence
of amine functional groups along with other groups help to increase
the activity of Pd NPs by electron donation. The catalytic activity
of Pd@APGO was compared with reported Pd0-AmPMCF (which utilizes MW),
and it was found that the Pd@APGO shows comparable activity and utilizes
lower temperature (Table 1, entry 19–20). Additionally, the catalytic activity
of Pd@APGO was compared with the recently reported, highly active
ASNTs@Pd, and it was found that the Pd@APGO shows similar activity
(Table 1, entry 21).44

After the optimization of reaction conditions
in hand, we have
further extended the catalytic activity of the Pd@APGO for the substrate
scope of biaryls (Table 2). The use of iodobenzene provides an excellent yield of biphenyl;
then, the use of bromobenzene and chlorobenzene as cheap aryl halides
were also tested and it was found that as compared to the iodobenzene,
bromobenzene provides a good yield, whereas chlorobenzene provides
a moderate yield (Table 2, entry 1). Then, the phenylboronic acids comprising
electron-withdrawing groups such as fluoro, chloro, and bromo were
studied, and it was observed that all are well-tolerant under optimized
reaction conditions and provide good to excellent yield of biaryls
(Table 2, entries 2–4).

were carried out for 6 h and 80 °C.

Next, the phenylboronic acids with electron-donating
substituents
such as methoxy and phenoxy at the ortho position were also tested,
and they were also found to be reactive and provides the excellent
yield (Table 2, entries 5–6). Then, the electron-donating group of phenylboronic
acids at the meta position such as methyl, methoxy, and phenyl group
also provides excellent yield of biaryls (Table 2, entries 7–9). Next,
alkyl halides containing electron withdrawing groups such as fluoro,
nitro, and carboxylic acids were tested, and it was found that they
also provided an excellent yield of coupled products (Table 2, entries 10–12). Notably, the strong electron-withdrawing group similar to 4-nitrochlorobenzene
was also well-tolerant and provides good yield. Then, the alkyl halides
containing methoxy and phenol group also provided good yield (Table 2, entries 13–14). The electronically withdrawing substrate similar to 1-(3-iodophenyl)ethanone
also provided a good yield of the coupled product (Table 2, entry 15).

Carbonylative Coupling Reactions
After the successful
application of Pd@APGO for the Suzuki coupling reaction, the Pd@APGO
catalyst then further utilized for the carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reaction to synthesize biaryl ketones. The biaryl ketones
are very important structural scaffolds found in a wide variety of
the molecules. Among the various methods reported for the synthesis
of biaryl ketones, carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura coupling by
using carbon monoxide (CO) as the C1 source is considered as the most
prominent method because of the wide functional group tolerance.40,41 Number of homogeneous and heterogeneous palladium-based catalysts
are well-documented in literature.42,43 By considering
the high activity of synthesized Pd@APGO catalyst for the synthesis
of biaryls, we applied for the synthesis of biaryl ketones by using
CO, aryl halides, and aryl boronic acids. Initially, CO (2 bar), aryl
iodide c (1 mmol), phenylboronic acid b (1.2
mmol), Pd@APGO (5 mg), anisole (10 mL), and K2CO3 (1.5 mmol) were utilized for the synthesis of biaryl ketones 16 at 80 °C. The Pd@APGO catalyst provides an excellent
yield of biaryl ketones up to 93% (Table 3, 16). Next, the substrate scope
was studied by using the Pd@APGO catalyst. Various electron-donating
phenylboronic acids such as methyl and methoxy were tested and a very
good yield of the carbonylated product was noted (Table 3, 17, 18, and 19). Then, electron-withdrawing functional groups
on boronic acids such as nitrile and nitro were tested for the carbonylative
coupling reaction, and it was found that they also provided good yields
of functionalized biaryl ketones (Table 3, 20 and 21). Interestingly,
aryl iodides containing heterocycles were tested for the coupling
reactions to synthesize the heterocyclic aromatic ketones such as
2-iodopyridine, 2-iodothiophene, and 3-iodo-1H-indole,
and the good yield was noted (Table 3, 22, 23 and 24).

Recyclability of the Catalyst
The developed Pd@APGO
catalyst was investigated for the recyclability by using a standard
reaction condition for the Suzuki coupling reaction of a phenylboronic
acid and aryl iodide. Notably, the Pd@APGO catalyst showed excellent
recyclability up to five recycle runs with negligible loss in its
activity (Figure 5).
To investigate the structural morphology after fifth recycles, the
Pd@APGO catalyst again were characterized by using SEM analysis; no
structural changes occurred after recyclability (Figure 6).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed Pd@APGO as a highly active catalyst
for the synthesis of biaryls and biaryl ketones from the Suzuki and
carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions. Similar to
the reported methods,45−47 it was found that the presence of amine groups on
the surface of GO stabilizes Pd NPs and accelerates the reactivity
of Pd NPs by electron donation of amine groups. A wide range of substrates
of biaryls and biaryl ketones with heterocyclic rings are affordable
by using the developed catalyst. High surface area and various functional
groups on GO (hydroxyl and amine) avoids the leaching of Pd NPs. The
synthesized Pd@APGO catalyst was well-characterized and showed high
activity and recyclability up to five recycle runs with the range
of the substrate scope.

Experimental Section
General
All chemicals
were purchased from diverse commercial
sources and were used without further purification. The reaction was
monitored by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
and thin layer chromatography using Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates.
The GC-MS-QP 2010 instrument (Rtx-17, 30 m × 25 mm i.d., the
film thickness (df) = 0.25 μm) (column
flow 2 mL min–1, 100–240 °C at 10 °C
min–1 rise) was used for the mass analysis of the
products. Graphite (45 mm) was purchased from Wako Chemicals. Products
were purified by column chromatography on 100–200 mesh silica
gel. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on 500 MHz spectrometers
in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.
The 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 125 MHz spectrometers
in CDCl3. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million
(δ) relative to TMS as an internal standard, and the J (coupling constant) values were reported in Hertz. The
products were confirmed by GC–MS and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis.

Synthetic Procedure of
the Pd@APGO Catalyst
The GO
is synthesized by using a modified Hummers method and then functionalized
with an amine by using our previously reported method21 (see Supporting Information S2 and for the synthesis of Pd@APGO(a), see Supporting Information S3b). The Pd@GOIL was prepared by using the general
impregnation–reduction system. Typically, in 5 mL of deionized
water, about 500 mg of AP-GO was dispersed under ultrasound. Then,
the desired amount of PdCl2 aqueous solution (0.016 g mL–1) was added into the round-bottom flask. Then, the
mixture was kept for an ultrasound treatment for 10 min, and a freshly
prepared aqueous solution of NaBH4 (9 mg mL–1) was added slowly. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred for 30
min. Again, the ultrasound treatment was performed for 25 min; the
resulting reaction mixture was filtered and the black powder product
was washed several times under vacuum by using deionized water and
EtOH. Then, the obtained reaction mixture was dried at 60 °C
for 6 h. The presence of 5 wt % of Pd metal on the surface of APGO
was confirmed by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectroscopy analysis.

General Procedure for the Suzuki Coupling
Reaction
In a typical procedure, the in-reaction vial aryl
halides (1.0 mmol),
boronic acids (1.2 mmol), K2CO3 (1.5 mmol),
Pd@APGO (5 mg), and water/ethanol (5 mL) as a solvent were taken.
The reaction mixture was continuously stirred for 6 h at the desired
temperature. Then, by adding 5 mL of EtOAc as a solvent in the reaction
mixture, the catalyst and the product were separated by using centrifugation
for 15 min at 10 000 rpm. To afford a pure product, the synthesized
substrates were purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 100–200
mesh size), with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate as the eluent. The
products were confirmed by GC–MS and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis. The same procedure was utilized
for the recycling of the Pd@APGO catalyst.

General Procedure for the
Carbonylative Coupling Reaction
In a stainless-steel autoclave
containing an automatic stirrer
(100 mL), aryl iodide (1 mmol), aryl boronic acid (1.2 mmol), K2CO3 (1.5 mmol) containing anisole (10 mL), and
5 mg Pd@APGO were added and then flushed with CO twice. At the room
temperature, the autoclave was pressurized with CO gas. After completion
of the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to the room temperature,
and the pressure of the CO gas was carefully released. Then, the reaction
mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 10 000 rpm, and Pd@APGO
was separated from the reaction mixture. To afford a pure product,
the synthesized substrates were purified by column chromatography
(silica gel, 100–200 mesh size), with petroleum ether-ethyl
acetate as the eluent. The products were confirmed by GC–MS
and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis.
