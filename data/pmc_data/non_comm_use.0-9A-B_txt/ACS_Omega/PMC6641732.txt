Nanometer-thin
coatings of polyhydroquinone (PHQ), which release
and absorb protons upon oxidation and reduction, respectively, were
tested for electrochemically induced anti-biofouling activity under
the hypothesis that a dynamic pH environment would discourage fouling.
Antifouling tests in artificial seawater using the marine, biofilm-forming
bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus proved
the coatings to be ineffective in fouling prevention but revealed
a deceiving artifact from the reactive species generated at the counter
electrode (CE), even for electrochemical bias potentials as low as
|400| mV versus Ag|AgCl. These findings provide valuable information
on the preparation of nanothin PHQ coatings and their electrochemical
behavior in artificial seawater. The results further demonstrate that
it is critical to isolate the CE in electrochemical anti-biofouling
testing.

Introduction
Marine biofouling is
a problem with severe economic and environmental
consequences, and environmental concerns and legislation are pushing
for biocide-free solutions.1,2 Emerging “green”
anti-biofouling technologies include nano-microstructured, low-adhesion,
amphiphilic, zwitterionic polymers, slippery liquid-infused porous
surfaces, and self-polishing coatings.1−7 Interestingly, even if inspiration is often drawn from nature for
such coatings, they are essentially designed as inactive materials.
By contrast, a coating allowing for an external input of energy could
be made to resemble a living system to a larger extent, for instance,
by changing its physical, mechanical, or chemical state in response
to a changing temperature8,9 or an applied electric
potential.3 A dielectric elastomer deforming
in response to an electric potential was reported by Shivapooja et
al. with promising results.3 The potential
required was, however, very large, several kilovolts, which may limit
the number of applications. Other approaches include the use of catalysts
or enzymes to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), with promising
results achieved under natural conditions.10,11

We hypothesized that the electroactive polymer polyhydroquinone
(PHQ) could be used to discourage biofouling through the formation
of a dynamic pH environment at the coating interface, as PHQ is known
to release and absorb protons upon oxidation and reduction, respectively.12−14 See Scheme 1 for
the structures of PHQ and the deprotonated polyquinone (PQ), as well
as the hypothesized effect on interface pH.

Scheme 1 Illustration of PHQ
and PQ upon Oxidation and Reduction and the Hypothesized
Effect on pH at the Coating–Water Interface
We prepared thin coatings of PHQ on gold-coated
surfaces and characterized
the thickness, morphology, electrochemical behavior, and anti-biofouling
properties. The biofouling studies of the marine organism Vibrio alginolyticus, a well-known model biofilm-forming
bacterium, were used as the model system to test the anti-biofouling
effect of the coatings upon oxidation and reduction with bias potentials
of |400| mV versus Ag|AgCl.

Results and Discussion
PHQ Synthesis and Characterization
13C and 1H NMR analysis confirmed a mixture
of oxidized and reduced
units in PHQ.15 The 1H NMR spectrum
exhibited three characteristic broad signals at 10.00 (A), 6.78 (B),
and 3.50 (C) ppm, which were assigned to phenolic protons, protons
of aromatic hydroquinone units (reduced form), and protons of aliphatic
(nonaromatic) quinoidal units (oxidized form), respectively (Figure S1).15 The
three broad signals at 10.35, 10.00, and 9.41 ppm indicated a twisted
conformation of the polymer in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).15 From the signals at 10.35 and 10.00 ppm, which
were assigned to terminal hydroquinone units, the molecular weight
was estimated to be 1200 g/mol, which matched the molecular weight
obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) spectrometry.

The electroactivity of PHQ in artificial
seawater at pH ≈ 8.1 was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry
(CV). The experiment was conducted in solution purged with N2, using a freshly polished solid gold electrode, dip-coated with
PHQ. A CV experiment is shown in Figure 1, in which the redox potentials for the transitions
at the given pH agreed well with those in the literature.13,14

Coating Preparation and
Characterization
Having established
the electroactivity of PHQ in degassed seawater, coatings were prepared
by spin-coating gold-coated microscopy slides with PHQ in ethanol.
The coating thickness as a function of PHQ concentration was determined
through ellipsometry and profilometry characterizations (Figure 2a). Coatings (10
nm) (prepared from 0.1% PHQ solutions) were deemed suitable for bacterial
testing as they displayed good surface coverage and a relatively smooth
surface (Figure 2b)
and because it allows for electron transport across the whole coating.16

PHQ coatings as a function of wt % PHQ in the ethanol solution, as
determined with ellipsometry and mechanical profilometry. Error bars
indicate 1 standard deviation (n = 3). (b) Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) height images of PHQ coatings spin-coated from
0.1% PHQ in ethanol onto a gold electrode.

The electrochemical behavior of the coatings was investigated
by
CV in N2-degassed artificial seawater and 100 mM KCl. An
increase in the redox currents was noted for the initial CV sweeps
between −600 and +600 mV and was interpreted as a voltage-induced
PHQ polymerization, leading to a more connected coating network (Figure S2). On the basis of these results, the
electrochemical procedure chosen for the bacterial fouling tests was
(i) five CV sweeps between −600 and +600 mV to allow for network
formation and (ii) constant potentials of −400 and +400 mV
in 60 s intervals to cycle between the protonated and deprotonated
states of PHQ.

Anti-Biofouling and Bacterial Viability Tests
To test
their anti-biofouling potential, the coatings were challenged with
the marine biofilm-forming bacterium V. alginolyticus in artificial seawater,17 containing
5% tryptone soy broth (TSB) as the nutrient. The coatings were evaluated
for 6 and 24 h with and without electrochemical (EC) treatment. Pure
gold surfaces were used as references. Fouling was very small on the
PHQ surface after both 6 and 24 h when alternating between oxidizing
and reducing potentials, whereas the pure gold surfaces were markedly
and highly fouled after 6 and 24 h (Figure 3a,b). The reason for the strong fouling on
gold after 24 h, even under alternating potentials (APs), was likely
passivation by the deposition of organic materials, as supported by
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S3). To eliminate the possibility
that the antifouling effect of PHQ was due to the changes in film
chemistry during the initial CV sweeps, a control experiment was carried
out in which the electrochemical protocol was stopped after the five
initial CV sweeps. The results revealed that further cycling was indeed
necessary to prevent fouling (Figure S4).

are indicated in the figure. The bacteria were stained with the BacLight

solutions after 6 h growth with/without EC treatment and incubation

for improved presentation.

To elucidate whether the EC treatment prevented fouling only
by
reducing the settlement on the surface or if the viability of the
bacteria was also affected, the bacterial solution was subjected to
streaking (plating out) on blood agar plates after the electrochemical
process. Interestingly, the bacterial viability was greatly reduced
for PHQ surfaces subjected to the electrochemical protocol, whereas
less effect on viability was observed using gold with/without the
EC treatment (Figure 3c).

To determine if the antibacterial action of the PHQ coating
occurred
only at the surface or if the whole solution was affected by the formation
of antibacterial species, we investigated the effect of EC treatment
of bacteria-free solutions (same procedure as above). After about
18 h of EC treatment, the solution was extracted, and bacteria were
added and streaked out on blood agar plates after incubation for 90
min. As seen in Figure 4, the bacterial viability was greatly reduced in solutions that had
been exposed to EC treatment. The same effect was seen in artificial
seawater with and without TSB. We therefore conclude that antibacterial
substances had been formed, thus affecting the bacteria both at the
coating surface and in the solution. The attempts to identify those
species and their origin are further discussed in subsequent sections.

agar plates after streaked-out bacteria added to artificial
seawater and seawater and TSB (1:20), with and without EC treatment.

presentation.

Coating Stability and Elemental
Composition
XPS and
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
(EQCM-D) indicated that the PHQ coating remained on the surface after
the EC treatment. EQCM-D analysis of PHQ coatings exposed to 6 h of
EC treatment in artificial seawater revealed a decrease in the frequency
and only small changes in dissipation, indicating either the slight
swelling of the PHQ coating or the deposition of material onto the
surface (Figure S5a). XPS analysis of coatings
submerged in artificial seawater for 6 h with or without EC treatment
revealed that the coatings exposed to step (i) or (ii) in the electrochemical
procedure were stable, whereas those not subjected to the EC treatment
seemed less stable, as seen from the Au/C ratios in Table S1. Furthermore, in the presence of TSB, the electrochemical
protocol resulted in dramatically decreased frequency and increased
dissipation in the EQCM-D experiment, clearly indicating the deposition
of TSB onto the PHQ coating (Figure S5b). This was coherent with the new XPS signals on the gold and PHQ
electrodes, in particular from calcium and phosphate, after the EC
treatment in TSB containing artificial seawater. Calcium was a component
of both the artificial seawater and the TSB, whereas phosphate was
mainly present in the TSB. From the large increase in O/C signal ratio
(Table S1), it was deemed likely that the
EC treatment resulted in the deposition of some calcium phosphate
on the surfaces. In conclusion, the XPS and EQCM-D results supported
a PHQ network induced by the CV presweeps that resulted in a stable
coating on the surface during further EC treatment. Furthermore, the
XPS analysis revealed the materials deposited on the PHQ and gold
surfaces during the application of constant potentials, especially
in the presence of TSB.

Investigation of the Identity of the Antibacterial
Species
Having established the formation of antibacterial
species and that
they were not degradation products of PHQ, it seemed likely that reactive
species (RS) were involved, especially as they are known antibacterial
agents,10,18,19 as the oxidation/reduction
of PHQ involves a radical intermediate,20 and as the autoxidation of hydroquinone by oxygen has been reported
to generate hydrogen peroxide.21,22

As a first attempt
to characterize the electrochemical processes and generated antibacterial
species, the PHQ-coated and pure gold electrodes were subjected to
CV sweeps between −400 and 400 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV/s
for about 20 h in artificial seawater and the presence of RS was tested
with ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) measurements using
methyl orange (MO).23Figure 5 shows the initial and the
final CV experiments for a fresh PHQ-coated electrode; the same PHQ-coated
electrode used in the second experiment after rinsing with fresh artificial
seawater; and a gold electrode. For the fresh PHQ-coated electrode,
the cathodic reduction of oxygen started just below 0 V during the
first sweep and later stabilized at −0.1 V, resulting in a
peak in the current around −0.25 V. The high reduction currents
remained throughout the experiment, as evident from the comparison
between the 5th and 500th scans. For the pristine gold electrode,
clear reduction currents were also observed but the reduction started
at lower potentials and there was no peak observed around −0.25
V. The observed reduction currents likely involved oxygen, as the
same reduction currents were not observed when degassed with N2 (Figure S2). The reactions occurred
for both the pure gold and the PHQ-coated electrodes, but the differences
indicated that the processes and thus formed species may differ. This
was later confirmed when the photometric MO assay, in which RS react
with MO to change the absorbance spectrum of MO, was used to test
for the presence of RS. For PHQ, it was also shown that the addition
of increasing volumes of RS solution to a constant concentration of
MO corresponded with an increasing shift in the spectra (Figure 6). MO solutions without
RS showed the typical absorption band at 465 nm (red line). The addition
of 100 μL of the RS-containing solution caused the intensity
of the absorption band at 465 nm to decrease by about 25%, and a weak
band emerged at 370 nm. Subsequent RS additions led gradually to an
increase in the intensity of the band at 370 nm while the intensity
of the band at 465 nm decreased, with close to zero intensity after
the addition of 500 μL of RS (orange line). Through the series,
the absorbance remained constant around 385 nm, indicating an isosbestic
point at which wavelength MO and the reaction product had the same
extinction coefficient. It was observed that the absorption band at
370 nm and the absorbance at the isosbestic point decreased at excess
RS (dotted orange line), indicating that the RS reacted further with
the product formed from the initial reaction between RS and MO. This
was confirmed by measuring the UV–vis spectrum after mixing
artificial seawater with MO with an equal volume containing the generated
RS (excess), where it was noted that the absorbance at 370 nm and
at the isosbestic point decreased over time, indicating the generation
of a new species (Figure S6). The experiment
was repeated for the pure gold electrode. As seen in Figure S7, no RS were detected for the gold surface in the
MO assay, indicating that fewer or different species were produced
at reducing currents. The MO assay also revealed that CV with the
reused PHQ electrodes did not result in detectable RS production,
which was also in line with the decrease in the peak current noted
from the reused PHQ electrode (Figure 5). This was likely due to the chemical changes in the
coating, as observed via C 1s XPS analysis (Figure S3).

electrode (Au). RE = Ag|AgCl (3 M KCl).

of MO solution with different amounts of RS-containing solution, final
[MO] = 5 ppm. (a) Full spectra and (b) spectrum zoomed in to clearly
show the change in absorbance at 370 nm.

To investigate the lifetime of the RS detected after CV,
the MO
assay was used on solutions taken directly after the EC treatment
and after storage for about 5 min in open glass vials at ambient temperature.
As seen in Figure 7, little to no change in MO absorbance was seen after the addition
of the stored RS solution, indicating that the lifetime of the RS
was shorter than 5 min.

fresh or stored
RS solutions from CV sweeps.

It was subsequently tested if the short lifetime of the RS
corresponded
with a transient toxicity in an artificial seawater solution subjected
to APs, as in the bacterial testing. Bacterial viability was tested
in solutions taken at different times after the EC treatment. The
results revealed that the viability was completely suppressed after
5 min, whereas a small viability increase was observed after 1 and
2 weeks (Figure 8).
The observations indicated that the antibacterial effect noted when
alternating the potential between −400 and +400 mV was not
only due to the RS formed with the CV treatment but also due to other
species.

Figure 8 Blood agar plates after streaking out bacteria added to artificial
seawater stored for different times after the EC treatment using a
PHQ-coated electrode and APs of −400 and 400 mV (RE = Ag|AgCl;
3 M KCl) in 60 s intervals. The brightness and contrast have been
digitally adjusted for improved presentation.

The presence and type of RS in artificial seawater subjected
to
APs were tested with the MO assay and UV–vis spectroscopy.
From the change in absorbance in the MO assay, it was concluded that
RS were formed for both PHQ and pure gold surfaces (Figure 9a), with indications that the
pure gold generated less and/or different species. In contrast to
the CV case, the RS produced by APs remained active for a longer duration
as seen in the MO spectrum of solutions stored for 30 min (Figure S8). It was further found that distinct
peaks appeared in the UV spectrum after the application of APs (Figure 9b). It is known that
antibacterial reactive chlorine species, for example, hypochlorite
can be electrochemically generated and that they may have distinct
UV signals.24−26 It was recognized that the UV absorption signals
of hypochlorite change upon protonation. We confirmed this mechanism
by recording the UV–vis spectrum of hypochlorite in artificial
seawater at low (pH ≈ 2.6) and high pH (pH = 8.1), see Figure 9c. As noted, the
signal disappeared almost completely at pH = 8.1, whereas a distinct
signal was present at 240 nm at pH ≈ 2.6. Artificial seawater
was exposed to APs using pure gold and PHQ electrodes, subsequently
acidified as described above, and distinct signals were observed at
230 and 235 nm for pure gold and PHQ, respectively (Figure 9d). Although blue-shifted compared
to the signals from the control hypochlorite solution, the difference
between these peaks could be due to a combination of absorbance from
hypochlorite and other species. In a control experiment, it was also
verified that hypochlorite indeed reacted with MO (Figure S9). To conclude this section, we note that by comparing
the different UV–vis spectra discussed above, a complex scenario
appears, indicating a mixture of species generated from the APs applied
using both the PHQ and pure gold electrodes, likely with significant
amounts of hypochlorite. Figure 9 indicates that APs applied using the PHQ electrode
generated more RS than using the pure gold electrode. However, it
is very difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding types and
amounts of the different RS that may or may not form with the two
electrodes in the current setup.

400 mV (RE = Ag|AgCl; 3 M KCl) in 60 s intervals on PHQ-coated (PHQ)
and gold (Au) electrodes for about 17 h. Nontreated artificial seawater

solution (8–12.5%) were included as controls. (a) Electrochemically

HCl (for pH ≈ 2.6). (d) Electrochemically treated artificial
seawater with 10 μL/3 mL 2 M HCl (for pH ≈ 2.6).

Under real-life conditions, large
amounts of organic species are
present and the bacterial tests were conducted in the presence of
the nutrient TSB. Therefore, the EC treatment was repeated for artificial
seawater with 1:20 TSB, as used in the bacterial testing. Samples
were extracted at the end of both oxidizing and reducing intervals.
As seen in Figure 10, no activity was observed in the MO assay and close to no changes
were recorded in the UV spectra after treatment, except for slightly
lower absorbance between 240 and 280 nm for samples not exposed to
the EC treatment. It was thus concluded that in the presence of TSB,
the formation of the RS was significantly quenched or altered. The
findings are likely applicable to the presence of other organic material
as well, and it seems likely that during the antibacterial tests,
the generated RS reacted with both the TSB and the bacteria.

seawater (1:20 volume ratio) after the EC treatment using APs of −400
and 400 mV (RE = Ag|AgCl; 3 M KCl) in 60 s intervals on PHQ-coated
(PHQ) and gold (Au) electrodes for about 17 h. Samples were extracted
and immediately added to the MO solution by the end of intervals with
both oxidizing (Ox.) and reducing (Red.) potentials. Nontreated artificial
seawater (SS) with MO was included as a control.

Antibacterial Species Originated from an Artifact in the Electrochemical
Testing
In electrochemical testing, reactions occur at the
working electrode (WE) at given potentials, and simultaneously, balancing
redox reactions occur at the counter electrode (CE). The potential
at the CE is not defined; rather, the potentiostat will apply the
potential bias needed to generate a current that balance the reactions
at the WE. In the present work, the bias potentials applied at the
WE were |400| mV versus Ag|AgCl. This is less than the potentials
at which water is oxidized and at which chlorine gas, which subsequently
form hypochlorite, is generated from saline water. The nominal oxidation
potential for water splitting is 1.23 V [vs normal hydrogen electrode
(NHE)], and commercial electrolyzers operate at potentials above 1.8
V (vs NHE).27

Given the low applied
voltages at the WE, it was not expected that hypochlorite and RS were
from the reactions at the CE, and no gas formation was visually observed.
However, to test if the RS were generated at the CE, it was separated
from the test solution using a glass tube with a frit during the application
of APs to a PHQ-coated WE. No RS was detected using the MO assay,
as seen from the lack of change in the MO spectra compared to those
of the control solution (Figure 11a), and only slight absorbance at short wavelengths,
which did not change upon acidification, was detected for the solution
without MO (Figure 11b). Antibacterial experiments were repeated with the CE separated
from the solution with a glass frit, applying APs to a PHQ-coated
WE for 6 h. No reduction in biofouling was observed for the PHQ-coated
electrode subjected to APs compared to the control without the application
of APs (Figure S10). In fact, it was hinted
that the control was less fouled, but the differences in how the bacteria
distributed on the surface made further conclusions difficult.

spectrum after the EC treatment for about 17 h using
APs of −400 and 400 mV (RE = Ag|AgCl; 3 M KCl) in 60 s intervals
and PHQ-coated WE electrodes, with the CE separated from the solution
using a glass frit. (a) Artificial seawater with 1:1 volume ratio

seawater (SS) with MO included as a control. (b) Electrochemically
treated artificial seawater with and without 10 μL/3 mL 2 M
HCl (for pH ≈ 2.6).

It was concluded that the observed antifouling and antibacterial
effects were due to an artifact from the species generated at the
CE, even under applied bias potentials as low as |400| mV versus Ag|AgCl.
The results clearly highlight the caution needed in the interpretation
of results when using electrochemistry in a biological setting and
the need to separate the CE from the WE in such studies.

Conclusions
We prepared and characterized thin coatings of PHQ and tested for
anti-biofouling under alternating oxidizing and reducing potentials
of |0.4 V| versus Ag|AgCl. The hypothesis was that proton release
and uptake of the material upon oxidation and reduction, respectively,
would discourage biofouling through a dynamic pH environment at the
coating–water interface. Initial observations indicated antifouling
and biocidal effects of the electroactivated coatings, but further
investigations revealed that the effects were an artifact from the
RS generated at the CE. Thus, the hypothesis was rejected. Nonetheless,
the results provide thorough information on the preparation of PHQ
coatings and their electrochemical behavior in seawater. The results
further act to demonstrate the great care that needs to be taken in
the setup and interpretation of results when combining electrochemistry
and biological studies, a field that will likely emerge further as
functional smart materials evolve.

other experiments.

PHQ Synthesis and Characterization
PHQ was enzymatically
synthesized as described previously13 and
stored under N2. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature
with a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer in DMSO-d6. The chemical shifts δ are referred to TMS (tetramethylsilane)
as a standard and were assigned as 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 3.50 (br s, 2H, quinone H), 6.78
(br s, 2H, hydroquinone H), 10.00 (br s, 2H, hydroquinone OH); 13C APT NMR (75 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ):
155.40 (2C, quaternary C), 150.62 (2C, quaternary C), 146.72 (2C,
quaternary C), 122.47–121.15 (2C, hydroquinone CH), 119.10–117.20
(2C, quinone CH). MALDI-TOF characterization of molecular weight was
conducted on a Bruker ultrafleXtreme MALDI/TOF/TOF equipped with a
2 kHz laser and using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile as the matrix.

PHQ Coating Preparation
PHQ was dissolved in ethanol
at different concentrations and spin-coated at 2000 rpm on gold-coated
microscopy slides with a titanium sublayer at room temperature (Deposition
Research Lab. Inc.) or cut 1 × 1 cm silicon wafers (WRS). Solid
gold electrodes were polymer-coated by submersion for 10 min in 0.1%
PHQ in ethanol, followed by gentle drying with N2.

Thickness
and Surface Morphology Characterization
The
coating thickness was characterized in triplicate on the silicon wafers
with a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE) and WVASE32
software (J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.) and a DektakXT profilometer with
a 12.5 μm stylus (Bruker) under a 3 mg load. The coating surface
morphology was investigated using ScanAsyst in air on a NanoScope
MultiMode 8 AFM (Bruker) with a NanoScope V controller.

Electrochemical
Characterization, Activation, and Reactive Species
Detection
Electrochemical experiments were performed using
potentiostats from Zahner and Autolab, with three-electrode setups.
For bacterial tests, the WE was a gold-coated microscopy slide, the
CE and RE were a rolled-up 82 × 82 wires/inch platinum mesh and
a silver wire (Ag pseudoref), respectively (Goodfellow). For dip-coated
coatings, solid gold, solid platinum, and a Ag|AgCl (3 M KCl) RE were
used as WE, CE, and RE, respectively (CH Instruments Inc.). For EQCM-D
experiments, the gold QCM sensor (Q-Sense) was the WE, a platinum
plate (Q-Sense) was the CE, and a Dri-Ref Ag|AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode
(World Precision Instruments, Inc.) was the RE. The electrolytes were
0.1 M KCl or artificial seawater. For the generation of RS during
CV, an area of about 2 × 2.5 cm of the WE was submerged in 20
mL of artificial seawater and the potential was cycled between 400
and −400 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV/s for 20 h. For the generation
of RS during the application of APs of −400 and +400 mV in
60 s intervals for 16–17 h, an area of about 4 × 2.5 cm
was submerged in 30 mL of artificial seawater with or without 1:20
TSB. The presence of RS was detected as follows: the requisite amount
of electrolyte solution containing RS was added to 10 ppm MO solution,
followed by the addition of artificial seawater for a final MO concentration
of 5 ppm. Furthermore, direct UV–vis absorbance on solution
without MO was used, with or without acidification using 10 μL/3
mL 2 M HCl. In all cases, UV–vis absorbance was measured on
a Varian Cary 300 Bio UV–vis spectrometer using a quartz cuvette
and the presence of RS was evaluated from the changes in the UV–vis
spectrum of MO or absorbance of the solution without MO. EC treatment
in bacterial tests refers to the continuous application of APs of
−400 and +400 mV in 60 s intervals. In experiments where the
contribution from the species generated at the CE was to be eliminated,
the CE was placed in a glass tube with a frit in the submerged end
and the tube was filled with the electrolyte solution. All potentials
are reported versus the used RE ≈ Ag|AgCl in the electrolytes
used.

QCM Analysis
The analyses were conducted on spin-coated
coatings using an E4 Quartz Crystal Microbalance, gold sensors, and
standard or electrochemical modules (Q-Sense) at a flow rate of 0.1
mL/min. Electrochemistry was conducted without flow.

X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy
The samples were taken
out of the solution, briefly rinsed with Milli-Q water, and dried
with nitrogen gas just before being loaded into the instrument. The
analyses were undertaken in duplicates using monochromatized Al Kα
X-rays (1486.7 eV) at a power of 225 W on a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer
(160 eV analyzer pass energy for survey scans and 20 eV for high-resolution
scans). The analysis spot size was ∼300 × 700 μm.
Data analysis was conducted using a CasaXPS.

Bacterial Testing
The PHQ-coated surfaces (from here
on referred to as PHQ surfaces or electrodes) and bare gold surfaces
(from here on referred to as gold surfaces or electrodes) were challenged
with V. alginolyticus (strain 130)
with/without EC treatment as follows: From −20 °C, bacteria
in TSB with 15% glycerol were cultured overnight at 37 °C on
Columbia horse blood agar plates (Oxoid). One colony was picked and
grown under aerobic conditions in TSB overnight at 37 °C. The
OD600 was adjusted to 0.1 (≈2.5 × 106 colony forming units/mL) in 1:20 TSB to artificial seawater. The
bacteria were added to Teflon block electrochemical cells with the
PHQ-coated, or pure gold, WE in vertical orientation, an exposed area
of 0.8 cm2, a volume of 1 mL. The same bacterial suspension
was split between the sample subjected to the EC treatment and the
control. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Five
CV presweeps were conducted for samples exposed to the EC treatment,
followed by the application of APs of −400 and +400 mV in 60
s intervals through 6 or 24 h of the experiments. Subsequently, the
medium was gently replaced with BacLight LIVE/DEAD solution (Life
Technologies) containing 1.5 μL/mL component A and B. The samples
were incubated for 30 min before being washed three times by gentle
immersion in deionized water. Images were recorded for hydrated samples
at 10× and 40× magnification using a green-red dual pass
filter on an Eclipse Ni-U fluorescent microscope. More than three
spots were analyzed per sample at each magnification. ImageJ was used
to quantify the fouled area of samples by analyzing three or more
images (locations) per sample and to calculate the average. The viability
of bacteria in the bulk solution after the experiments was evaluated
by streaking out 100 μL of solution on Columbia horse blood
agar plates (Oxoid) at 1000× or 10 000× dilutions,
followed by incubation overnight. The effect of solution subjected
to the EC treatment on the viability of fresh bacteria was assessed
as follows: Artificial seawater with and without TSB was exposed to
the EC treatment using a gold or PHQ electrode for 16–19 h.
Subsequently, bacterial solutions grown in TSB overnight were diluted
25× with artificial seawater and were added to the solutions
subjected to the EC treatment, for a total dilution of 1000×
or 10 000×. The samples were incubated for 90 min before
streaking on blood agar plates and incubation overnight.
