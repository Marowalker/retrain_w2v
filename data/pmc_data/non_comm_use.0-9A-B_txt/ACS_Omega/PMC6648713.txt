Sensitive
detection of uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) activity is
very important in the study of many fundamental biochemical processes
and clinical applications. Here, we develop a novel assay for the
detection of UDG activity by using the self-initiating multiple rolling
circle amplification (SM-RCA) strategy. We first design a trigger
probe modified with NH2 at its 3′-terminal and uracil
base in the middle of sequence, which is complementary to a cyclized
padlock probe. In the presence of UDG, a uracil base can be excised
by UDG to generate an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. The AP site
is recognized and cleaved by endonuclease IV (Endo IV), releasing
the primer with 3′-OH. The primer can trigger the rolling circle
amplification (RCA) reaction, producing a long and repeated DNA strand
embedded some uracil bases. These uracil bases can be cleaved by UDG
and Endo IV again, and then, more primers are generated to initiate
SM-RCA reaction, producing large amounts of DNA product. Afterward,
the DNA product is measured by a specific DNA fluorescence dye for
quantitative detection of UDG activity. The linear range of the method
is 5 × 10–5 to 1.25 × 10–3 U/mL, and the detection limit is 1.7 × 10–5 U/mL. This method not only utilizes the target UDG itself to trigger
RCA but also further induces SM-RCA reaction, providing a simple,
sensitive, and cost-effective strategy for the detection of glycosylase
and clinical diagnosis.

1 Introduction
DNA
glycosylases are a class of enzymes that remove the damaged
nitrogenous base while leaving the sugar–phosphate backbone
intact in DNA, creating an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site.1 As the damaged base leaves the double-helix DNA,
the N-glycosidic bond is cleaved to initiate the
base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is an essential DNA repair
pathway for maintaining genome stability.2−4 There are many
kinds of DNA glycosylases in organisms, and different DNA glycosylases
are responsible for different base excision repair pathways, respectively.5−9 Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is a protein enzyme that specifically
recognizes and removes uracil lesions in both double- and single-stranded
DNAs, leaving an AP site in DNA to trigger the downstream repairing
process.10−13 UDG plays key roles in maintaining genomic integrity in cell cycle
regulation, apoptosis, virus proliferation, and so on.14 The abnormal expression of DNA glycosylases
is closely related to various human diseases, such as human immunodeficiency,
bloom syndrome, cancers, and so on.15−19 Therefore, detection of UDG is vital especially for
studying mechanisms and functions of many basic biochemical processes
and disease diagnosis.20,21

Commonly, the activity
of UDG is measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA),22 gel-based methods,23 electrochemical assays,24 and colorimetric methods.25,26 However, these methods
generally suffered from complex steps and low sensitivity. Furthermore,
to improve the sensitivity of UDG detection, many amplification strategies
have been developed, including hybridization chain reaction (HCR),27 catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA),28 exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR),29 strand displacement amplification (SDA),30,31 and rolling circle amplification (RCA),32,33 and so on. HCR and CHA are simple and rapid for detection of UDG
resulting from their enzyme-free amplification mechanism, but their
sensitivities are limited. The isothermal EXPAR, SDA, and RCA have
high sensitivity to detect UDG activity. However, these methods suffer
from the complex probe designs and reaction steps. Among them, the
RCA-based UDG detection utilized a probe containing uracil (U) base,
which can be excised by UDG to produce an AP site and then cleaved
by endonuclease IV (Endo IV). The cleaved probe subsequently served
as a template to ligate and cyclize the padlock probe (PLP) by DNA
ligase to trigger RCA. Furthermore, to improve the sensitivity of
UDG detection, a nicking enzyme was usually used to induce the multiple
RCA, which was sophisticated and costly.33

In this paper, we take full advantage of the characteristics
of
UDG and Endo IV and develop a self-initiating multiple RCA (SM-RCA)
strategy for the detection of UDG activity. The cyclized padlock probe
(cPLP) is preprepared, and the cPLP is directly used during the UDG
detection, which greatly reduces the complexity and saves time. A
trigger probe (TP) is designed with a uracil base in the middle of
TP sequence. Only in the presence of UDG, the uracil base in TP can
be excised by UDG to form an AP site that can be cleaved by Endo IV.
Then, the cleaved TP can act as a primer to trigger RCA. By introduction
of dUTP in RCA reaction, the DNA product of RCA contains many of the
uracil bases, which can be recognized and cleaved by UDG and Endo
IV again, leading to more primers for further inducing SM-RCA. Therefore,
UDG activity can be detected by measuring the DNA product using a
specific DNA fluorescence dye. In the SM-RCA reaction, the target
UDG first triggers the RCA reaction with the assistance of Endo IV
and then initiates the multiple RCA reaction, which is simple, sensitive,
and cost-effective for the detection of UDG activity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Principle of the SM-RCA
Strategy for UDG Activity
Detection
Figure 1 shows the SM-RCA strategy for UDG activity detection. First,
we design a padlock probe (PLP), which can be ligated with template
DNA by using T4 DNA ligase to form cPLP. The preparation of the cPLP
was characterized by gel electrophoresis analysis (Figure S1). Moreover, TP with a uracil base in the middle
of sequence and NH2 modification at 3′-terminal
is designed to perfectly complementary to cPLP. When TP only hybridizes
with cPLP, no amplification reaction takes place owing to the NH2 modification at 3′-terminal of TP. In the presence
of UDG, the U base in TP is excised, generating an AP site. The AP
site can be recognized and cleaved by Endo IV to generate the truncated
TP with 3′-OH, which serves as a primer to trigger the RCA
reaction, producing a long-repeated single-strand DNA (ssDNA). At
the same time, because of the addition of dUTP in RCA reaction, many
of the U bases are randomly bound to the long-strand DNA product,
which can subsequently be excised by UDG to produce many of the AP
sites. A large amount of UDG recognition sites is provided after RCA
initiation, UDG can find its substrates easily and perform its activity
with greatly improved efficiency. After cleaved by Endo IV, there
will be several primers on each cPLP, multiple replication forks simultaneously
work on a cPLP to enlarge RCA amplification. The long RCA product
can also hybridize with more cPLP, producing new primers and initiating
new RCA reaction. Moreover, some RCA products are disassociated during
the extension, and the above process is repeated. In these RCA reactions,
U bases are continuously introduced to form SM-RCA. Ultimately, the
UDG activity can be detected through quantitation of the DNA from
SM-RCA by the enhanced fluorescence signal of a specific DNA fluorescence
dye, SYBR Green I. This method only combines UDG with Endo IV to achieve
the SM-RCA, providing a simple, cost-efficient, and highly sensitive
strategy for UDG activity detection.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the detection
of UDG activity by SM-RCA.

To verify the feasibility of the method, real-time fluorescence
signals under different conditions were measured. As shown in Figure 2a, in the absence
of UDG and/or Endo IV, the fluorescence intensities increased a little
in curves 1, 3, and 4. These results are due to the fact that TP cannot
be cleaved to produce a primer in solution without UDG and/or Endo
IV, and the 3′-terminal NH2-modified TP cannot initiate
the RCA reaction. The weak fluorescence signals in solution mainly
come from the nonspecific amplification of DNA. For curve 5, the fluorescence
intensity was only slightly enhanced. This is ascribed to the fact
that when both UDG and Endo IV coexist in reaction solution, the TP
can be cleaved to release the primer. The new primer only initiates
linear RCA with low amplification efficiency, and the multiple RCA
reaction cannot be formed in the solution without the addition of
dUTP. In contrast, for curve 2, the fluorescence intensities increased
remarkably with the addition of dUTP in RCA reaction in the presence
of UDG and Endo IV. The result is attributed to the fact that the
U base in TP is first cleaved by UDG and Endo IV, triggering RCA reaction
to generate a long-strand DNA containing U bases. The multiple U bases
can be cleaved by UDG and Endo IV to release more primers, inducing
multiple RCA to produce large amounts of DNA. These results indicate
that the combination of UDG and Endo IV in RCA can initiate the SM-RCA
and significantly enhance the sensitivity of UDG detection.

Figure 2 (a) Real-time
fluorescence detection UDG under different conditions:
(1) negative control test only containing TP, cPLP, and dNTPs (including
dUTP) without UDG and Endo IV in RCA reaction, (2) positive test with
UDG and Endo IV in RCA reaction, (3) negative control test with UDG
but no Endo IV in RCA reaction, (4) negative control test with Endo
IV but no UDG in RCA reaction, and (5) negative control test without
dUTP in RCA reaction. (b). Agarose gel electrophoresis results of
RCA products, lanes 1–5 correspond to curves 1–5 in
(a), respectively. The concentrations of reagents were 0.01 U UDG,
1 nM TP, 10 nM cPLP, 10 U Endo IV, 10 U phi29 DNA polymerase, 1 mM
dNTP (with or without 1:9 dTTP/dUTP ).

Furthermore, we also performed agarose gel electrophoresis
to investigate
the feasibility of the method. As shown in Figure 2b, no distinct DNA product bands were found
in lanes 1, 3, 4, and 5. The results in lanes 1, 3, and 4 were attributed
to the fact that no RCA reaction occurred in these reaction solutions.
For lane 5, because there was no dUTP in the RCA mixture, the combination
of UDG and Endo IV only initiated linear RCA, producing a little amount
of DNA. By comparison, a bright band and a series of dispersion bands
with different molecular weights of DNA were clearly observed in lane
2, suggesting that the multiple RCA was successfully performed with
the addition of dUTP in the RCA mixture. These results are identical
with those in Figure 2a, which further indicates that combining UDG with Endo IV in RCA
can achieve SM-RCA to detect UDG activity sensitively.

2.2 Quantitative Detection of UDG Activity
Under the optimal
experimental conditions (Figure S2), the activity of UDG was detected by the SM-RCA strategy.
As shown in Figure 3a, the fluorescence intensities increased gradually with the increase
of the concentration of UDG from 5 × 10–5 to
5 × 10–3 U/mL. Figure 3b showed that the relative fluorescence intensities
were linearly dependent on the concentration of UDG in a range of
5 × 10–5 to 1.25 × 10–3 U/mL. The correlation equations were ΔIF = 14.71 + 49.94C (10–4 U/mL) with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9937, where ΔIF is the relative
fluorescence intensity. According to the 3σ rule, the detection
limit was calculated as 1.7 × 10–5 U/mL, which
was comparable to that of exonuclease-assisted signal amplification
in combination with magnetic separation (2 × 10–5 U/mL)8 and had been improved by three
order of magnitude as compared with those of the G-quadruplex-based
luminescent assay (0.02 U/mL)34 and the
label-free colorimetric assay (0.02 U/mL),35 and two order of magnitude as compared with that of RCA-based assay
(0.002 U/mL).36

concentrations of UDG from 5 × 10–5 to 5 ×
10–3 U/mL. (b) The linear relationship between the
relative fluorescence intensities and the concentration of UDG. Error
bars were obtained from three repetitive measurements.

2.3 Specificity of the Proposed
Method
The specificity of this method mainly relied on the
specific uracil
excision by UDG. To evaluate the detection specificity, we used nonspecific
exonuclease III (Exo III) and human alkyladenine glycosylase (hAAG)
as the negative controls. Exo III cannot recognize and excise a uracil
base from a DNA substrate, so it cannot trigger the RCA. The hAAG
can only excise alkylated and oxidative DNA-damaged sites, including
3-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, 1,N6-ethenoadenine, and hypoxanthine; however, it cannot produce the
AP sites and primers used in this research. As shown in Figure 4, the fluorescence signal of
UDG was much stronger than those of Exo III and hAAG that were almost
equivalent to the signal value of the blank solution. The results
show that the proposed SM-RCA method possesses the good specificity
for the detection of UDG activity.

of UDG activity by SM-RCA.
Error bars were obtained from three repetitive measurements.

2.4 UDG Inhibition
Assay
To demonstrate
the feasibility of the proposed method for UDG inhibition assay, we
selected uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) as a model inhibitor.
UGI can bind with UDG at a rate of 1:1 in mol and form a tight and
physiologically irreversible complex.37 As shown in Figure 5, as the concentration of UGI increased, the relative activity of
UDG gradually decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and a IC50 value (the UGI concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of UDG
activity) of 2.4 × 10–4 U/mL was obtained,
which is consistent with that reported in the literature.21,29 This result indicates that the proposed method could provide a potential
platform for the screening of UDG inhibitors.

Figure 5 Inhibition effect of
different concentrations of UGI on the UDG
activity. The concentration of UDG was 5 × 10–4 U/mL. Error bars were obtained from three repetitive measurements.

2.5 Real
Sample Detection
To study the
applicability of our proposed method, we examined the activity of
UDG in HeLa cell lysates. We further studied the relationship between
fluorescence intensity and number of HeLa cells. Figure 6 showed that the fluorescence
intensity increased with the increasing number of HeLa cells. Notably,
the fluorescence intensity showed a linear correlation with the number
of HeLa cells in the range from 0.5 to 10 cells. The correlation equation
was ΔIF = 44.20N + 79.41, with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9968, where ΔIF is
the relative fluorescence intensity and N is the
number of HeLa cells. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.2
cells, which was comparable to that obtained by enzyme-assisted isothermal
amplification-based fluorescent assay (three cells).38,39

relationship between the relative fluorescence intensities
and the number of HeLa cells. Error bars were obtained from three
repetitive measurements.

Furthermore, a recovery test was used to evaluate the accuracy
of the proposed method by a real sample of HeLa cells spiked with
two different concentrations of UDG. The recoveries were in the range
of 86.0–105.0%, and the corresponding RSD was 1.6–5.1%
(Table S1). These results indicated that
the proposed SM-RCA strategy can be used for the determination of
UDG in real samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we develop a novel, simple, and sensitive method for
the detection of UDG by taking full of the characteristics of UDG
and End IV, which directly initiate SM-RCA. The preprepared cPLP is
directly used during the UDG detection, which greatly reduces the
complexity and saves time. By introduction of dUTP in the RCA reaction,
the long-strand DNA generated from RCA contains some uracil bases
brokenly. The uracil bases in DNA can be recognized and excised continuously
by combining UDG with Endo IV, which generates more primers to initiate
the multiple RCA, leading to the enhanced sensitivity of UDG detection.
In the method, a large amount of UDG recognition sites is provided
after RCA initiation, where UDG can find its substrates easily and
perform its activity with greatly improved efficiency. The target
UDG itself is not only used to trigger the RCA but also further induced
the SM-RCA reaction with the assistance of Endo IV, which is simple
and cost-effective as compared with the other nicking enzyme-mediated
RCA methods.28,29 In addition, as the large amounts
of DNA generated from SM-RCA can be detected by various methods, such
as fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or electrochemisty, the SM-RCA
provides a simple, sensitive, and universal analysis platform for
glycosylase and clinical diagnosis.
