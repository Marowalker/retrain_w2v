Hydroxyapatite–starch
composites solidify rapidly via jellification,
making them suitable candidates for robocasting. However, many aspects
related to hydroxyapatite powder characteristics, hydroxyapatite–starch
interaction, and composites composition and properties need to be
aligned with robocasting requirements to achieve a notable improvement
in the functionality of printed scaffolds intended for bone regeneration.
This article presents a preliminary evaluation of hydroxyapatite–starch
microcomposites. Thermal analysis of the starting powders was performed
for predicting composites’ behavior during heat-induced densification.
Also, morphology, mechanical properties, and hydroxyapatite–starch
interaction were evaluated for the jellified composites and the porous
bodies obtained after conventional sintering, for different starch
additions, and for ceramic particle size distributions. The results
indicate that starch could be used for hydroxyapatite consolidation
in limited quantities, whereas the composites shall be processed under
controlled temperature. Due to a different mechanical behavior induced
by particle size and geometry, a wide particle size distribution of
hydroxyapatite powder is recommended for further robocasting ink development.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Building ceramic scaffolds
that provide a suitable environment
for bone regeneration faces significant challenges. Besides the requirements
related to materials and fabrication technologies, a bone scaffold
should ensure both adequate porosity (for bone formation and vascularization)
and mechanical strength necessary during the initial phases of bone
recovery.1,2 Various materials are currently considered
for scaffold fabrication. Calcium phosphates such as hydroxyapatite
(HA), α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP), and β-tricalcium
phosphate (β-TCP) are often the materials of choice for bone
scaffolds, given their similarity with the mineral component of the
bone.2

Calcium phosphate scaffolds
can be fabricated through both conventional1 or additive manufacturing methods.3 Robocasting,4 an additive
manufacturing method closely related with “direct ink writing”,5 “direct write assembly”,6,7 and “(micro-)robotic deposition”,8,9 has
gained interest for fabrication of bone scaffolds because it is able
to provide a high mechanical quality to the printed products while
being adaptable for a wide range of materials.10

Robocasting involves the extrusion (at low temperatures
and pressures)
of an ink filament followed by fusion with the previously extruded
filaments (by means of superficial tension). Because the quality of
robocasted parts is mainly influenced by the ink composition and properties,
a suitable ink formulation shall be homogeneous, adequate for extrusion
through fine nozzles, and able to rapidly solidify to self-sustain
after extrusion. On the one hand, precursor selection has a significant
impact in ink development: main criteria are related to particle dimension,
geometry, and size distribution of the powders. Micrometric particle
sizes (lower than the diameter of robocasting nozzles) are required
for preventing ink jamming during extrusion. Also, particle geometry
and size distribution shall enhance ink consolidation and prevent
the formation of air bubbles that may compromise ink’s mechanical
stability after extrusion.3,7,10,11 On the other hand, binder selection
and dosing contribute greatly to the preparation of a homogeneous
dispersion with a high ceramic content (which shall prevent excessive
shrinkage during drying and subsequent densification). Rapid solidification
(by coagulation, evaporation, jellification, etc.) of the binder–powder
mixture shall ensure the self-sustaining ability of the ink.12 Moreover, biomedical applications shall comply
with additional requirements regarding binder’s lack of toxicity
and its complete and safe degradation during manufacturing. Adequate
levels of microporosity shall also be ensured by the ink during robocasting
of bone scaffolds (whereas macroporosity shall be ensured by scaffold
design).

Water-based formulations with HA and/or β-TCP
have already
been proposed as robocasting inks because they are considered simple
to prepare, low-priced, and nontoxic. Preparation of water-based inks
with calcium phosphates also includes the addition of low amounts
of polymers as dispersants, viscosifiers, jellifying, and antifoaming
agents.6,10,13

The
current study aims to broaden the materials palette for robocasting
by proposing starch as a jellifying agent for water-based formulations
with hydroxyapatite. Starch is a natural polymer found in vegetables
such as potatoes, rice, and corn, and was used in hydroxyapatite mainly
as a pore-forming agent,14,15 but various methods
of ceramic consolidation based on starch jellification were also proposed.16,17

As robocasting represents both a major opportunity and a challenge
for fabrication of ceramic components with stringent design requirements,
this study presents the initial evaluation of HA–starch formulations
in terms of morphology, mechanical properties, and hydroxyapatite–starch
structure. A testification of the application of hydroxyapatite–starch
formulations for robocasting, which shall involve extensive material
characterization, including rheological, biological, and additional
mechanical testing, will be covered in a future study.

Bovine
bone-derived HA and food grade corn starch were chosen as
powder precursors due to their proven suitability for biomedical applications.2,18 HA–starch samples were prepared with water, without using
other additives. Starch concentration and HA particle size distribution
were the main variables evaluated in the study; valuable insights
related to particle size and geometry were also included. The investigation
of hydroxyapatite–starch formulations with different compositions,
which began with a thermal analysis of raw starch and hydroxyapatite
powders (derived from bovine bone), was performed for predicting the
materials’ behavior during heat-induced densification. Next,
composites based on HA and various quantities of starch were evaluated
in terms of morphology, structure, and mechanical properties. Finally,
full densification of jellified composites was achieved by conventional
sintering, which also allowed starch removal and pore formation; the
thermal-treated materials were evaluated in comparison with jellified
ones (Figure 1).

Throughout the study, the as-prepared hydroxyapatite powder
is
coded “HA a.p.” and initial corn starch powder is described
as “raw starch”. The jellified and thermal-treated HA–starch
samples are distinguished by the terms “jellified” and
“thermal-treated” followed by starch content (wt %):
0, 5, 10, 25, and 50%, respectively.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Thermal Behavior of Powdered
Precursors
Five distinct domains of thermal transformations/decompositions
are identified by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) during heating
in air (Figure 2).
The first heating domain (denoted I), from room temperature (RT) to
200 °C, shows a ∼10% weight loss in raw starch and a ∼0.2%
weight loss in the as-prepared (a.p.) HA powder. The second heating
domain (II), from 200 to ∼520 °C, shows a ∼0.34%
weight loss in HA a.p. and a 3.8% weight loss in raw starch. Thermal
analysis of raw starch is recorded up to 288 °C; above this temperature,
the gas accumulated during the heat-induced reactions leads to a violent
burst, so the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)/TGA data are
not reliable. The third heating domain (III), from 520 to ∼740
°C, shows a 0.65% weight loss in HA a.p. The fourth heating domain
(IV), 740–1379 °C, shows a ∼2.5% weight loss in
HA a.p. The last domain (V), 1379–1500 °C, shows a ∼0.23%
weight loss in HA a.p.

mixed powders.
Starch content is expressed as weight percent.

The DSC data show different domains of exothermic and endothermic
transformations that accompany the thermal decompositions (Figure 3 and Table 1). The first domain of DSC (denoted
I), selected from RT to 250 °C, contains a large exothermic peak
of HA a.p. and a strong endothermic peak of starch, both of which
cover transformations I and II observed by the TGA. The second domain,
250–600 °C (II), contained a weak and large exothermic
peak of HA and three exothermic peaks (a–c) given by the presence
of starch in HA. The third domain, 600–750 °C, includes
a weak exothermic peak given by HA. The fourth to sixth domains contain
two weak (IV and V) and one strong (VI) endothermic peaks that belong
to HA.

The endothermic transformation
of starch is assigned to gelatinization19 and evaporation of excessive water, as seen
in the TGA data (Figure 2). The thermal effects induced by starch can be observed in the mixed
HA–starch powders starting with 200 °C. The starch successively
decomposes with temperature (domains II–V, Figure 2).

HA undergoes a succession
of thermal transformations/decompositions
(Figure 3 and Table 1), also accompanied
by weight loss. The weight loss at low temperatures is assigned to
evaporation of adsorbed water and hydroxyl groups on the surface of
HA.20,21 Thermal stability of HA in air atmosphere
is proved until up to ∼1200 °C.

2.2 Morphology
Evolution during Preparation of
HA–Starch Samples
HA and starch powders morphologies
are comparatively represented in Figure 4. The raw starch powder consists of spherical
particles with smooth surfaces and 10–20 μm particle
size. The HA a.p. has different morphologies based on particle size
distribution. The mixed HA powder (Figure 4b), prepared from a mix of equal amounts
of four types of sorted powders—namely 25 wt % particles sized
<20 μm + 25 wt % particles sized <50 μm + 25 wt
% particles sized <100 μm + 25 wt % particles sized <200
μm—consisted of particles similar with corresponding
granulometric sorts presented in Figure 4c–f. Particles are distributed randomly,
with smaller-sized particles filling in the interstices between the
larger ones. HA particles smaller than 100 μm (Figure 4c–e) are preponderantly
polyhedral (with few elongated particles) with sharp edges and coarse
surfaces.

Figure 4 Initial powders morphology: (a) raw starch; and HA a.p. with different
particle sizes: (b) mixed HA (equal parts of sorts presented in (c)–(f));
(c) <20 μm; (d) <50 μm; (e) <100 μm; and
(f) <200 μm.

The sorted powder, sized 100–200 μm (Figure 4f), consists of polyhedral
particles with rounded edges. The surface of the larger particles
is covered with agglomerations of small-sized particles (<20 μm).
HA particles surface has small-sized pores that remain after the removal
of bone organics during thermal treatment,22 and some of the particles have cracks generated by milling and sorting.

The morphologies of jellified composites and thermal-treated bodies
are presented comparatively in Figure 5 for different starch concentrations and particle size
distributions. The control samples consisting of HA without starch
are included in the analysis for evaluation.

Figure 5 Morphology of jellified
and thermal-treated HA–starch composites
prepared with sorted (100–200 μm) and mixed HA powders.
Starch content is expressed as weight percent on each scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) micrograph.

The jellified materials prepared with sorted HA powders (100–200
μm) and different starch quantities (left column in Figure 5) consisted of polyhedral
ceramic particles well represented within the consolidated bodies.
The samples contained pores with various shapes and dimensions. Addition
of starch in low concentrations (HA with 5 wt % starch) leads to a
better packing of the samples due to pores filling. In the samples
with starch additions higher than 10 wt %, the spherical (darker)
starch particles are unified in a polymeric network, which encloses
the HA particles.

Starch addition ensures a bimodal particle
size distribution, which
contributes to porosity decrease and better consolidation of the jellified
body (first and third column in Figure 5); this observation is supported by similar results,
in which the starch addition to HA leads to the preparation of cements
with compact morphologies and enhanced mechanical characteristics.23 The use of mixed powders leads to an enhanced
packing of jellified bodies, their porosity being significantly reduced
compared with the samples prepared with sorted HA (Figure 5, third vs first column from
left to right).

Ceramic body consolidation is achieved mainly
by starch jellification.
Starch jellifies in aqueous solutions, at 60–80 °C. The
process begins with the swelling of starch grains, whereas their crystalline
regions are damaged. These damaged regions are then adsorbed at the
ceramic particles surface; this enhances the mechanical strength of
the consolidated body.18,24 The influence of starch addition
upon the morphology is best observed in the samples with higher starch
concentrations (25–50 wt %) in which the large ceramic particles
are covered with gel scales consisting of starch and small HA particles.

Thermal treatment leads to thermal degradation and removal of starch
and the formation of porous ceramic bodies consisting of consolidated
large particles covered with smaller particles. The porosity corresponds
to the shape and quantity of jellified starch. In the sintered samples
(second and fourth columns in Figure 5), the size and shape of hydroxyapatite particles do
not suffer any significant modifications as a consequence of sintering,
thus confirming that sintering does not influence the ceramic’s
morphology.

The degradable starch filler is completely removed
after the thermal
treatment is performed at 1200 °C. As a consequence of thermal
degradation, the spaces initially filled starch are replaced by randomly
distributed pores. The shape and quantity of these pores correspond
to the shape and quantity of starch filler in the jellified samples
(as noted in previous studies25), so the
samples that initially contained higher starch quantities exhibit
an increased porosity as compared with the hydroxyapatite samples
prepared without starch.

2.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The XRD patterns
of the HA as-prepared (a.p.) powder and heat-treated HA–starch
samples are presented comparatively in Figure 6. For evaluation we have also included in Figure 6 the pattern of the
as-jellified 50% HA–50% starch sample, as well as the diagrams
of two control samples: simple HA powder thermal-treated samples (i)
in the absence and (ii) in the presence of HA–starch.

Figure 6 Comparative
XRD patterns of the simple HA powder, and HA–starch
blends, before and after their thermal treatment in air.

The presence of starch can be highlighted by XRD
only in the case
of 50% HA–50% starch jellified sample, as fade humps in the
2θ ≈ 10–22° range (the corresponding highlighted
region in Figure 6 is
presented enlarged in Figure 7). This is due to the reduced crystalline status (Figure 7) and low density
of starch, which translates into a lower diffracted intensity. For
lower starch contents, the signal is buried in the background noise.
From the comparison of the raw and jellified starch powders (Figure 7), we can deduce
that no modification at long-range order occurs in the starch structure
during the jellification process.

Figure 7 XRD pattern of unannealed 50% HA–50%
starch blend presented
comparatively to the patterns of raw starch and jellified and dried
starch powders.

After the thermal-treatment
has been applied (i.e., 1200 °C/4
h in air) to the HA–starch, no significant structural modifications
can be detected by XRD, apart from the appearance as a residual secondary
phase of calcium oxide (CaO) (Figure 6, starred peak). Both, the mean crystalline size (∼250
nm) and lattice parameters (a = 9.419 Å; c = 6.882 Å) of HA, were found to be fairly constant
in the case of all of the sintered blends. The content of CaO does
not appear to be influenced by the presence of starch (Figure 6); its amount, estimated by
Rietveld full-pattern structure refinement method, is in the range
0.35–0.70 wt % for all of the samples. Furthermore, the presence
of CaO in similar concentration in both simple HA powder batches—(i)
heat-treated in the absence and (ii) presence of HA–starch—strengthens
our hypothesis. One can note that the ISO 13779 standards,26,27 which regulate the fabrication of implants, state that a content
of maximum 5 wt % of impurity phases (i.e., α-tricalcium phosphate,
β-tricalcium phosphate, tetracalcium phosphate, and/or CaO)
in HA materials is considered as acceptable for clinical applications.
Consequently, the composition of the materials proposed in this study
is situated significantly below the limit imposed by the ISO 13779
standard.

The formation of the crystalline CaO phase during
thermal processing
of HA can be considered rather rare. In literature, three possible
hydroxyapatite decomposition reactions have been advanced (eq 1 (refs (28−31)); eq 2 (refs (28−32)); eq 3 (ref (33))) 1   2   3  

The absence of tricalcium phosphate,
either in crystalline—XRD
(Figure 6) or amorphous—Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) (Figure 9) forms, in the case of all of the thermal-treated
samples suggests eq 3 as partial decomposition route of hydroxyapatite. Kim et al.33 associate this partial conversion of HA into
crystalline CaO to its severe dehydroxylation. This is to be expected
when performing a second sintering procedure, as was the case of our
studies. The absence of P2O5 as the crystalline
phase (Figure 6) can
be explained by its low sublimation temperature (∼300 °C).33 The binary CaO–P2O5 equilibrium phase diagram2,28,32,34 suggests that phases such as
CaO or P2O5 cannot easily emerge in the system
at temperatures lower than 1720 °C. However, our result is not
unprecedented, as previous studies have shown that CaO can form even
at 1000 °C in the case of HA materials with a Ca/P molar ratios
higher than the stoichiometric theoretical value (i.e., 1.67).35,36

2.4 FTIR Spectroscopy Measurements
The
FTIR spectra of the as-jellified and thermal-treated HA–starch
blends are presented in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. For an easy visualization of the IR spectra details,
they are presented in the fingerprint (Figures 8a and 9a) and functional
groups (Figures 8b
and 9b) separate wave numbers regions. The
spectra of HA a.p. and starch starting materials, as well as of a
pure CaO (Sigma-Aldrich) powder, are presented in Figures 8 and 9 for comparison purposes.

Figure 8 Comparative FTIR spectra of the simple HA, CaO,
and starch powders,
and unannealed HA–starch blends, collected in the fingerprint
(a) and functional groups (b) regions.

Figure 9 Comparative FTIR spectra of the simple HA, and CaO powders, and
thermal-treated HA–starch blends, collected in the fingerprint
(a) and functional groups (b) regions.

Typical IR envelopes of hydroxyapatite37 have been recorded by FTIR in the case of all HA–starch
blends
(Figure 8). All of
the characteristic vibration bands of hydroxyapatite have been identified:
libration (∼629 cm–1) and stretching modes
(∼3570 cm–1) of hydroxyl structural groups
and ν4 bending (∼560–600 cm–1), ν1 symmetric stretching (∼962 cm–1), and ν3 asymmetric stretching (1000–1090
cm–1) modes of orthophosphate groups.37−39

In the case of the blends, part of the starch IR bands are
overlapped
by the more intense HA maxima, and thus obscured. A complete assignment
of both HA and starch bands is given in Table 2. In the regions of lower HA absorption (Figure 10a), the vibration
bands of starch can be easily depicted, having a similar intensity
ratio and presenting no wavelength shifts with respect to the raw
powder (Figure 8):
out-of-phase bending of hydrogen-bonded OH– groups
(709 cm–1), rocking of −CH2 groups
(763 cm–1), bending modes of C–H bonds (857
cm–1), vibration in rings and bending of C–O
(929 cm–1), stretching vibrations of C–O–C
and C–O–H bonds (1050 cm–1), and bending
(1652 cm–1) and stretching (2500–3600 cm–1) of adsorbed water molecules.37,40−42 This gives a first indication that the starch structure
is not strongly modified during the jellification process, and thus,
supports the XRD findings (Figure 7).

The higher the starch content in
the materials, the more prominent
its bands are, and more significant is the level of material hydration
(Figure 8).

However,
slight band shifts are signalled in the case of the stretching
vibrations of C–C bonds (from 1414 to 1418 cm–1) and in-plane bending vibrations of −CH2 groups
(from 1460 to 1456 cm–1) between pure starch and
HA–starch blends (Figure 8a). This is attributed to the superposition in this
specific region of the ν3 asymmetric stretching bands
of carbonate groups present in the structure of HA,37−39 which results
in the modification of the peaks profile. The presence of carbonate
groups in the structure of HA is supported also by the shallow band
positioned at ∼874 cm–1, in case of both
HA a.p. and HA–starch jellified blends, ascribed to the bending
vibrations of carbonate groups.37−39 Carbonatation is typical of HA
materials derived from animal bones.43,44

Further,
insightful comparative FTIR measurements have been performed
on starch found in three forms: raw, jellified, and jellified and
dried at room temperature (Figure 11). Upon jellification, the starch uptakes significant
amount of water, as demonstrated by the intensity increase of bands
corresponding to bending (1652 cm–1) and stretching
vibrations of adsorbed water molecules (2500–3600 cm–1). Apart from this, one can notice modifications in the intensity
ratio of symmetric stretching of (C–H) bonds in benzene rings
(2928 cm–1) and asymmetric stretching of (−CH2) groups (2972 cm–1) bands (Figure 11, inset). This suggests that
slight perturbations of these specific chemical environments occur.

Figure 11 Comparative
FTIR spectra of starch in raw, jellified, and jellified
and dried form. Inset: zoomed region of C–H stretching bands
wave numbers domain (2800–3100 cm–1).

The doubly split bands positioned
in the 2800–3000 cm–1 region (Figures 8b and 9b), observed also in
the case of simple HA a.p. powder, are assigned to the various C–H
stretching vibrations determined by adventitious hydrocarbon contamination
of samples during handling and storing in ambient. Their shape is
modified only in the case of higher concentrations of starch in the
blends.

In the case of thermal-treated HA–starch blends
(Figure 9), one can
notice
the disappearance of all of the starch IR bands. Concurrently, the
hydroxyapatite bands’ position and allure (Figure 9a) are preserved with respect
to the jellified blended samples and HA a.p. control (Figure 8a). This points toward the
excellent capability of the chosen thermal route to eliminate the
starch from the scaffold bodies and conserve unaltered the structure
of the HA material. The carbonatation of HA, which is known to elicit
remarkable biological properties,39,45−48 has been fairly well maintained (Figure 10b,c) after sintering. The presence of C–H
stretching vibrations due to adventitious hydrocarbon contamination
has been evidenced also in the case of the thermal-treated samples
(Figure 9b). Their
intensity varies as a function of the haphazard degree of contamination.

However, a new vibration band emerges at ∼3642 cm–1 in the spectra of all of the sintered blends, which is characteristic
to the stretching vibrations of (OH)− groups of
surface Ca(OH)2 compounds.49−51 This is a consequence
of the hygroscopic nature of the CaO phase that is obtained as the
residual product during sintering (Figure 6). In contact with ambient, the surface of
the CaO regions adsorbs water molecules and gets partially hydrolyzed.

2.5 Mechanical Properties
The load–stroke
curves of jellified and thermal-treated (Figure 12) HA–starch specimens are presented
in comparison with control samples (HA). Compression testing is performed
only for 0, 5, 10, and 25 wt % starch concentrations. The HA samples
with 50 wt % starch collapse under their own weight shortly after
thermal treatment.

Figure 12 Load–stroke curves for jellified and thermal-treated
samples
prepared with HA and starch. Starch content is expressed as weight
percent on each curve.

Based on the ceramic particle size distribution and starch
concentration,
the load–stroke curves have different slopes, which suggest
differences between load absorption and, implicitly, specimens’
microstructure. The HA green body (jellified—0 wt % starch)
has a typical brittle behavior, without a plastic deformation. Material’s
stiffness decreases with an increase in starch concentration. The
jellified specimens prepared with sorted HA powders and 5–10
wt % starch exhibit a linear segment on the load displacement curve,
which is explained by the pores compaction during compression. The
jellified 25 wt % starch specimens exhibited a plastic/malleable behavior,
with significant shortening of ∼1.4 mm.

Because the different
particle size distribution leads to different
packing configuration, the specimens prepared with mixed HA powders
exhibit a higher strength due to particle arrangement, which increases
the surface that may absorb mechanical loads. A decrease in ultimate
strength is observed when the specimens with sorted HA powders are
tested (41 vs 60 N—the ultimate strength of specimens prepared
with mixed powders).

Thermal treatment induces a significant
improvement in the mechanical
properties of all of the tested specimens. Similar to jellified composites,
the thermal-treated samples (ceramics from which starch is removed
by thermal degradation) exhibit superior mechanical properties when
prepared with mixed HA powders. An additional decrease in mechanical
characteristics of the thermal-treated materials with an increase
in starch concentration is also observed.

The compressive strength
of jellified specimens (Figure 13a) decreases with an increase
in starch concentration. A minor influence of HA particle size distribution
is also observed, the specimens prepared with sorted powders (100–200
μm) having a slightly lower compression strength as compared
to the ones prepared with mixed powders. This influence is due mainly
to the better compaction and decreased porosity of jellified samples
prepared with mixed HA powders.

Figure 13 Compressive strength of (a) jellified
and (b) thermal-treated HA
and HA–starch samples. Starch content is expressed as weight
percent for each sample.

Thermal treatment increases the compressive strength of the
samples
(Figure 13b). Maximum
results are obtained for the specimen prepared with mixed HA powders
without starch addition, which exhibit compressive strengths similar
to cortical bone (170–200 MPa52).
Significant differences are observed both due to starch concentration
and particle size distribution. Because starch is removed after thermal
treatment, the compressive strength of the specimens is attributed
to the ceramic body densified by sintering.

Higher starch concentrations
are equivalent to higher quantities
of removed materials, which contributes to the decrease in compressive
strength. However, this decrease is not significant for specimens
prepared with sorted HA powders (100–200 μm) because
all of the specimens exhibit a rather low compressive strength—10–20
MPa. Higher strength values, which significantly decrease with increase
in starch concentration, are observed for the specimens prepared with
mixed powders: the compressive strength decreases from 100 MPa for
5 wt % starch to 10 MPa for 25 wt % starch. After the thermal treatment,
the spaces initially filled with starch are free, so the mechanical
strength of thermal-treated bodies is ensured through particle junctions.
Because the 100–200 μm particles geometry involves a
large number of sharp edges (Figure 1f), the mechanical strength is ensured primarily through
pointlike junctions, leading to overall poor mechanical properties
that are not suitable for bone reconstruction.

3 Conclusions
Incorporation of starch as a consolidation and
porogen agent in
hydroxyapatite allowed the preparation of materials with suitable
composition for clinical applications (materials’ suitability
for medical applications still needs to be confirmed by in vitro evaluations).

The jellification of HA–starch materials occurred without
significant structural modifications of the components. However, successful
use of the rapid solidification abilities of starch is strictly dependent
of the paste temperature during extrusion because starch jellification
occurs in a limited temperature range (60–80 °C).

After the thermal treatment, starch was degraded and removed, leading
to consolidated hydroxyapatite products with different levels of porosity
corresponding to the quantity of incorporated starch and the HA particle
size distribution (sorted or mixed powders). Starch incorporation
was possible up to 25 wt % in the ceramic mixture; the samples prepared
with higher concentrations collapsed immediately after the thermal
treatment.

Because the mechanical testing of heat-treated samples
prepared
with sorted HA indicated poor mechanical properties for bone scaffolds,
for next stages of robocasting ink development, the use of mixed powders
with different particle sizes is recommended, which will ensure a
homogeneous distribution of ceramic particles in the jellified samples.
However, the compression strength of robocasted parts is expected
to be significantly lower due to reduced surface of filaments and
the net scaffold density, further influenced by the micro- and macroporosity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Samples Preparation
4.1.1 HA and Starch Powders
HA was prepared
by thermal processing of bovine bone according to a previously described
protocol.22,53 HA powder was obtained by milling the calcined
bone in a planetary mill with agate bowl and balls54 and sorting the powders with standardized granulometric
sieves.

Two HA powder batches were used in the experiments:
(i) sorted powder—with 100–200 μm particle size;
and (ii) mixed powder—prepared by mixing equal parts of powders
with particles sizes <20, 20–40, 40–100, and 100–200
μm.

Each type of HA powder (sorted and mixed) was homogenized
with
0–50 wt % food grade corn starch powder in the as-received
state. Each batch of HA–starch powder was homogenized for 15
min using a tumbler mixer.

4.1.2 Jellified HA–Starch
Samples
The HA–starch powders were homogenized with
water in water/powder
ratio of 1/4. Starch jellification was induced by heating the solutions
at 70 ± 2 °C with continuous stirring. The jellified samples
were formed by cold isostatic pressing at 25 MPa. Jellified samples
were allowed to dry in atmospheric air for 240 h before testing.

4.1.3 Thermal-Treated HA–Starch Samples
The cylindrical jellified samples with different HA particle size
distribution and different starch content were sintered in an electrical
furnace in air atmosphere at 1200 °C for 4 h. The sintered bodies
were stored at ambient conditions until testing.

For morphological
and structural characterization, HA and starch powders were analyzed
in their initial state. The jellified and thermal-treated HA–starch
cylindrical samples were carefully fractured for analyzing the inner
surfaces. For mechanical testing, jellified and heat-treated HA–starch
specimens were machined to obtain smooth cylindrical samples (n = 5), with a final diameter of 10.0 ± 0.2 mm and
a final height of 10.0 ± 2.1 mm.

4.2 Characterization
Thermal analyses
of the as-prepared/as-received and mixed powders of HA and starch
were performed with a DSC/TGA SDTQ600 equipment in the 20–1500
°C range. Experiments were performed in synthetic air, using
alumina crucibles, and samples of ∼20 mg. The gas flow rate
was 25 mL/min, and the heating rate was 10 °C/min.

Morphological
characterization of the precursor powders, jellified, and thermal-treated
ceramic bodies with different starch additions was performed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) using a Philips ESEM 30 equipment in the
low-vacuum mode at 0.7 mbar pressure. The samples were imaged without
any coating or preparation.

The crystalline status of the materials
was investigated with a
Bruker D8 Advance X-ray difractometer, with Cu Kα (λ =
1.5418 Å) radiation, using a high efficiency linear detector
of Lynx Eye type. The films were scanned in the angular range of 2θ
= 9–50°, with a step size of 0.02° and 2 s acquisition
time per step.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
was used for analyzing
the functional groups present in the samples. The analyses were performed
with a PerkinElmer BX Spectrum spectrometer, in attenuated total reflection
mode using a Pike-MIRacle diamond head of 1.8 mm diameter. The spectra
were recorded in the range 530–4000 cm–1 at
a resolution of 4 cm–1, with a total of 128 scans
per experiment.

Compression testing was performed with a Walter+Bai
LSB300 universal
testing machine with a 300 kN load cell. The machine cross head speed
was set to 1 mm/min with data acquisition at 0.05 s.
