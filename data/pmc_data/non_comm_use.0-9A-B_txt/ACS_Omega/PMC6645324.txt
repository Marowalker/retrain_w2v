Monolayered tungsten dichalcogenide
quantum dots (WS2 QDs) have various potential applications
due to their large spin–valley coupling and excellent photoluminescence
(PL) properties. What is expected is that with the decrease in lateral
size of QDs, the stronger quantum confinement effect will dramatically
strengthen the spin–valley coupling and widen the band gap.
However, ultrasmall monolayered WS2 QDs prepared by ion
intercalation unavoidably undergo the problem of structural defects,
which will create defect levels and significantly change their properties.
In this study, we report that by annealing defective monolayered WS2 QDs in sulfur vapor, pristine monolayered WS2 QDs
with an ultrasmall lateral size of ca. 1.8–3.8 nm can be obtained.
The results show that the ultrasmall monolayered WS2 QDs
exhibit a giant spin–valley coupling of ca. 821 meV. Moreover,
the pristine ultrasmall monolayered WS2 QDs show purple
PL centered at 416 nm, and the defect PL peaks in defective WS2 QDs can be effectively removed by annealing. All of these
results afford
the ultrasmall monolayered QDs various applications such as in optoelectronics,
spintronics, valleytronics, and so on.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have aroused great interest
recently due to a wide range of physical and chemical properties.1−6 The structure
of monolayered TMDs is MX2 (M = Mo or W and X = S, Se,
or Te), consisting of an intermediate layer of M atoms sandwiched
between two layers of X atoms with strong ionic–covalent bonds.4 Recently, 2D TMDs with large spin–valley
coupling, which will introduce a strong coupling between the spin
and valley degrees of freedom, have aroused continual and tremendous
interest for potential applications in spintronics, valleytronics,
and so on.7−10 For example, monolayered MoS2 and MoSe2 have been confirmed to own the spin–valley coupling
of ca. 150 and 180 meV,9,11 respectively. However, the applications
are hampered due to the modest spin splitting, which necessitates
superpurity materials, low temperature, and the long channel lengths.12,13

Interestingly, due to the strong spin–orbit coupling
(SOC) in 5d orbitals of tungsten and the broken inversion symmetry,
monolayered WS2 sheets exhibit a much larger spin–valley
coupling of up to 426 meV.12,14,15 Moreover, previous studies have shown an indirect-to-direct band
gap transition in monolayered WS2 sheets due to the missing
interlayer interaction.5,6 Therefore, the large spin–valley
coupling combined with the presence of direct band gap in monolayered
WS2 sheets affords them different applications in optoelectronics,
spintronics, valleytronics, and so on.16−19 By further reducing
the lateral size of monolayered WS2 sheets, monolayered
WS2 quantum dots (QDs) can be obtained. Normally, the WS2 sheets whose lateral size is under 100 nm can be named as
WS2 quantum dots (QDs).20,23,24 The monolayered WS2 QDs can exhibit more
striking properties than monolayered sheets due to the strong quantum
confinement effect.20−24 In general,
with the decrease in lateral size of QDs, the stronger quantum confinement
effect will dramatically strengthen the spin–valley coupling
and widen the band gap.20,21,25,26 Therefore, investigations of
the spin–valley coupling and photoluminescence (PL) of ultrasmall
monolayered WS2 QDs are favorable to both the fundamental
study and their applications.

In this article, we show that
the pristine monolayered WS2 QDs with the ultrasmall lateral
size of ca. 1.8–3.8 nm and purely semiconducting phase can
be obtained by annealing Li-intercalated WS2 QDs in sulfur
vapor. The results show that the pristine ultrasmall monolayered WS2 QDs exhibit a giant spin–valley coupling of ca. 821
meV and two clear peaks at 416 and 342 nm in PL spectra. Compared
with the monolayered WS2 sheets and QDs with general lateral
size, the ultrasmall monolayered WS2 QDs show significant
improvement in spin–valley coupling and a great blue shift
in PL, making
them highly valuable for optoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics,
and so on.

Furthermore, it should be noted that so far the mass
production of ultrasmall monolayered WS2 QDs is mainly
realized by Li-ion intercalation.27,28 However, the
as-prepared QDs generally have plenty of structural defects such as
high oxidation state and plenty of sulfur vacancies, which will unavoidably
create defect levels in the electronic band.20 In addition, there are both metallic phase and semiconducting phase
in these WS2 QDs.2,29,30 The facts that the structural defects in our as-prepared QDs have
been restored and the metallic phase has been discarded after annealing
in sulfur vapor confirm the effectiveness of our method for the preparation
of pristine WS2 QDs with a purely semiconducting phase.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of as-prepared WS2 QDs
(a-WS2 QDs). Particle size analysis shows that the diameter
distribution of these dots is approximately 2–4 nm with an
average lateral size of ca. 3.2 nm (inset of Figure 1a). The lattice spacing is 0.22 nm (inset
of Figure 1a), stemming
from the (103) plane.31 After annealing,
the diameter distribution is approximately 1.8–3.8 nm with
an ultrasmall average lateral size ca. 2.9 nm (inset of Figure 1b). The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) image presents a clear lattice fringe
with lattice spacing of 0.22 nm (inset of Figure 1b), similar to that of a-WS2 QDs.
Shown in Figure 1c,d
are the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of a-WS2 QDs
and annealed WS2 QDs. The topographic heights of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs are ca. 0.5 and 0.4 nm,
respectively (insets of Figure 1c,d), indicating that all of these quantum dots are monolayered.
All of the results imply that annealing did not significantly change
the size and thickness of a-WS2 QDs.

white lines.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to investigate the
chemical environment of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs. Shown in Figure 2a are the XPS survey spectra over a range of binding energies of
a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs. As found, there
is a striking oxygen XPS peak for a-WS2 QDs, similar to
the reported results.22,32−34 This indicates a massive number
of oxygen groups in a-WS2 QDs. By contrast, the oxygen
peak almost disappeared completely for the annealed sample after annealing.
The contents of elements W, S, and O, respectively, are 24.2, 42.1,
and 33.7% for a-WS2 QDs and are, respectively, 31.5, 64.7,
and 3.8% for the annealed sample. Clearly, the content of O shows
a drastic decrease from 33.7% to only 3.8% after annealing, demonstrating
further that oxygen groups in a-WS2 QDs have been effectively
removed after annealing. It is considered that a massive number of
oxygen groups in a-WS2 QDs mainly results from oxidation
of water during the process of chemical exfoliation.28 Reasonably, the infinitesimal oxygen content in annealed
WS2 QDs may arise from the physical absorption of CO2 and O2 on the surface of QDs. Accordingly, one
can calculate the S/W atomic ratio, which is ca. 1.74 in a-WS2 QDs. The ratio is much lower than the stoichiometric ratio
of 2 in perfect monolayered WS2, implying the formation
of sulfur vacancies during chemical exfoliation, which may be attributed
to the partial
oxidization of W. However, the calculated ratio of ca. 2.05 for the
annealed sample is very close to 2, suggesting that the oxygen groups
in a-WS2 QDs can be effectively removed and the sulfur
vacancies can be well repaired after annealing.

Figure 2 (a) XPS
survey spectra over a range of binding energies (0–600 eV)
and (b) high-resolution W 4f spectra of a-WS2 QDs and annealed
WS2 QDs.

Figure 2b shows the W 4f fine-scan
spectra of the as-prepared and annealed samples. After the subtraction
of Shirley background, the spectra were well fitted with the Gaussian–Lorentzian
sum function (80% Lorentzian and 20% Gaussian). The spectrum of a-WS2 QDs can be deconvoluted to seven subpeaks: 1T-W4+ 4f7/2 (31.96 eV), 1T-W4+ 4f5/2 (34.06
eV), 2H-W4+ 4f7/2 (32.76 eV), 2H-W4+ 4f5/2 (34.86 eV), W6+ 4f7/2 (35.68
eV), W6+ 4f5/2 (37.80 eV), and W 5p3/2 (38.47 eV), similar to previous works.32,35 After
annealing, there are only three subpeaks at 32.92, 35.10, and 38.62
eV, corresponding to 2H-W4+ 4f7/2, 2H-W4+ 4f5/2, and W4+ 5p3/2 core
energy levels, respectively. The high valence state of W6+ is attributed to the oxidation states in a-WS2 QDs,35,36 in good agreement with the high content of the bonded oxygen. However,
the absence of W6+ peaks in the annealed sample implies
that the hexavalent tungsten has been completely converted to a tetravalent
form. Moreover, it is known that there is a metallic 1T phase (octahedral)
in WS2 QDs obtained by Li intercalation, which will be
transferred to the semiconducting 2H phase (trigonal prismatic) after
annealing.2,29,30 Obviously,
the 1T-W4+ 4f7/2 and 1T-W4+ 4f5/2 peaks completely disappear in annealed WS2 QDs,
revealing the exhaustive phase-transition from 1T to 2H. Therefore,
semiconducting WS2 QDs with a high-purity 2H phase are
obtained.

To further investigate the structural changes before
and after annealing, Raman measurements were performed on the as-prepared
and annealed samples. Considering that the Raman signals of WS2 QDs are much weaker than those of bulk WS2,37 532 nm excitation wavelength was used to enrich
the spectra, which would reveal many second-order peaks.6,38,39 As shown in Figure 3, the first-order modes LA(M)
and A1g(Γ) are located at 176 and 418 cm–1, respectively. The strongest peak at 352.5 cm–1 is attributed to the second-order mode 2LA(M) at 351.5 cm–1 and the first-order mode E2g1(Γ) at
355.8 cm–1.38 It is found
that the A1g(Γ) mode weakened after annealing. Therefore,
we carried out the Gaussian–Lorentzian fitting to separate
their individual contributions and calculate the relative intensity I2LA/IA1g. The intensity
ratios of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs, respectively,
are 1.5 and 2.3, which further indicate that both of the samples are
monolayered.38 One can find that the increase
in the intensity ratio from 1.5 to 2.3 attributes to the small reduction
of the A1g(Γ) mode. Considering the existence of
high content of oxygen groups in a-WS2 QDs, those oxygen
groups bonded to tungsten or sulfur atoms are more likely to increase
the out-of-plane phonon restoring force, which will lead to the enhancement
of the A1g(Γ) mode.38 After
annealing, oxygen groups are wiped off and thus the A1g(Γ) mode decreases.

lines are
the measurements, and black lines are Gaussian–Lorentzian peak
fits.

All of these results indicate that
by annealing of defective a-WS2 QDs, one can (i) restore
their structural defects and (ii) discard the residual metallic 1T
phase. Our monolayered WS2 QDs with an ultrasmall lateral
size of ca. 1.8–3.8 nm are favorable to investigate the intrinsic
properties of pristine, ultrasmall, and monolayered WS2 QDs with a purely semiconducting phase.

To investigate the
optical properties of WS2 QDs before and after annealing,
we measured the UV–vis extinction spectra. As known, there
are in general three absorption peaks at A (625 nm), B (550 nm), and
C (450 nm) in monolayered WS2 sheets.40 The A and B peaks were considered to originated from two
kinds of transitions from the spin-splitting valence band to the conduction
band at the K point of the Brillouin zone,12,40 whereas
the absorption peak C may be attributed to the optical transitions
between the density-of-state peaks in the valence and conduction bands.40,41Figure 4a shows the
UV–vis extinction spectra of a-WS2 QDs and annealed
WS2 QDs. It is found that greatly different from the case
of a-WS2 QDs where no clear absorption peak can be seen,
there are three clear absorption peaks at ca. 379, 303, and 269 nm
in annealed WS2 QDs, which can be assigned, respectively,
to the excitonic absorption peaks A, B, and C. The difference between
the spectral shape of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs may show the phase transition from 1T to 2H.42 The excitonic transitions of A (379 nm) and B (303 nm)
are clearly recognizable in the extinction spectrum of annealed WS2 QDs (2H phase), whereas they are absent in a-WS2 QDs with a high content of 1T phase. Moreover, due to a large proportion
of the 1T metallic phase, the extinction spectrum of a-WS2 QDs exhibits a broader absorption across a wide spectral region.
Clearly, the A and B absorption peaks are blue-shifted by ca. 14 and
30 nm, respectively, with respect to those of QDs with a lateral size
of 8–15 nm, as reported in refs (20). As reported, due to the quantum confinement
and edge effects, the blue shift in extinction spectra may appear
in QDs with a decrease in the lateral size.37,43,44 Reasonably, the ultrasmall lateral size
of our WS2 QDs may be responsible for the observed blue
shift. As known, 2D materials with spin–valley coupling have
a pair of degenerated valleys at the high-symmetry K and K′
points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone.13,14 The spin-splitting
valence bands V1 and V2 are schematically illustrated
in Figure 4b. The presence
of distinct A
and B absorption peaks in annealed WS2 QDs may also suggest
that their electronic band structures become more intrinsic after
annealing. One can find that the direct band gap labeled according
to absorption peak A,
393 nm (3.27 eV), is much larger than that of monolayered WS2 sheets (1.98 eV) and QDs (3.16 eV) with the general lateral size,
as reported in ref20, 40.
Reasonably, the wider band gap of our QDs may be attributed to the
ultrasmall size due to the stronger quantum confinement effect.20,21,25,26 Most
importantly, it is found that the great energy difference (ΔSO) between A and B excitonic absorption peaks in annealed
WS2 QDs is large, up to ca. 821 meV, implying the appearance
of a giant spin–valley coupling. As reported, monolayered MoS2 and MoSe2 have spin–valley couplings of
ca. 150 and 180 meV,9,11 respectively. By contrast, due
to the strong SOC in 5d orbitals of tungsten, monolayered WS2 sheets exhibit a much larger spin–valley coupling of about
426 meV.12,14,15,40 Notably, this value in our ultrasmall monolayered
WS2 QDs is much larger than 570 meV for general WS2 QDs with a lateral size of ∼8–15 nm.20

To further study the optical properties
of WS2 QDs before and after annealing, we measured the
PL spectra. As shown in Figure 5a,b, the PL spectra of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs were measured with excitation wavelength from 290 to
350 nm. Both of them exhibit an excitation-dependent PL behavior.
It is found that with the increase of the excitation wavelength from
290 to 350 nm, the intensity of the main PL peak increases first and
then decreases. On excitation at 310 nm, the PL spectra show a strongest
peak at 416 nm. PL excitation (PLE) spectra of the two samples were
investigated with a detection wavelength of 416 nm, which was determined
by PL investigations of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs with various excitation wavelengths (Figure 5a,b). It should be noted that the influence
of the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent on PL
spectra has been eliminated (as illustrated in Figures S1 and S2). Shown in Figure 5c are the normalized PLE spectra with the
detection wavelength of 416 nm. The same peak position at 315 nm was
detected in both samples, which is considered to be the strongest
excitation wavelength for both samples.

WS2 QDs with various excitation wavelengths. (c) Normalized
PLE spectra with the detection wavelength of 416 nm and (d) normalized
PL spectra at the excitation wavelength of 315 nm of a-WS2 QDs and annealed WS2 QDs.

The PL properties of
monolayered WS2 sheets and WS2 QDs with the
general lateral size have been well investigated. As reported, there
is one strong emission peak A at ca. 638 nm and a weak emission peak
B at ca. 530 nm for WS2 sheets6,16,40 and one strong emission peak A at ca. 461
nm and a weak emission peak B at ca. 369 nm for WS2 QDs
with the general lateral size of 8–15 nm.20Figure 5d shows the normalized PL spectra of a-WS2 QDs and annealed
WS2 QDs using the excitation wavelength of 315 nm. For
the case of a-WS2 QDs, the highest emission peak A is located
at ca. 420 nm. It is found that there are only two distinct emission
peaks at 416 and 342 nm for the annealed WS2 QDs, corresponding
to A and B emission peaks. It is clear that compared with the general
WS2 QDs our ultrasmall QDs show a great blue shift in both
A and B emission peaks, respectively, of ca. 45 and 27 nm in the PL
spectrum.

Notably, it is found that there is an obvious peak
at 466 nm (2.66 eV) and several other shoulder emission peaks at greater
than 420 nm in the as-prepared QDs, similar to the results reported
in ref (20). These
shoulder emission peaks were considered to originate from the transitions
from the conduction band to the new defect levels above the valence
band (as illustrated in Figure 4b).20 It is clear that defect-related
emission peaks in a-WS2 QDs were eliminated due to the
restoration of an intrinsic band structure. Moreover, one can find
that broad peaks in a-WS2 QDs were narrowed after restoration
(Figure 5d). All of
these results indicate further the structural restoration of a-WS2 QDs after annealing, leading to the perfect structure with
an intrinsic electronic band.

As mentioned above, the strong
quantum confinement effect will dramatically strengthen the spin–valley
coupling and increase the band gap of QDs.20,21,25,26 Therefore,
one can propose
that both the giant energy difference (ΔSO) and the
purple PL in our annealed WS2 QDs may be attributed to
the ultrasmall lateral size. We should note that there is no clear
spin–orbit splitting observed in a-WS2 QDs. As reported,
structural defects in monolayered TMDs would induce intervalley electronic
scattering and defects are the common limiting factors that can provide
the required momentum for intervalley scattering due to their short-range
nature.45 Therefore, even if the giant
spin–valley coupling is in pristine WS2 QDs due
to the suppression in the intervalley scattering, the features expected
from the valence band may be absent due to the high-density defects
in defective a-WS2 QDs. As we noted, the defect PL peaks
have been removed completely, which may lead to the shift of the highest
main PL emission position. Compared with WS2 QDs with the
general lateral size, our WS2 QDs with the ultrasmall lateral
size have stronger spin–valley coupling and greatly blue-shifted
emission, which afford them high potential for various applications.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we
have synthesized pristine, monolayered, and semiconducting WS2 QDs with an ultrasmall lateral size of ca. 1.8–3.8
nm by annealing defective WS2 QDs in sulfur vapor. The
results showed that after annealing (i) a giant spin–valley
coupling up to ca. 821 meV appeared; (ii) the ultrasmall monolayered
WS2 QDs showed purple PL centered at 416 nm, and the defect-related
areas in PL spectra of defective WS2 QDs disappeared. The
fact that the excellent properties of pristine QDs are absent in the
as-prepared ones suggests the necessity of sulfur annealing. Compared
with the general WS2 sheets or QDs reported, the ultrasmall
monolayered WS2 QDs show a significant improvement in spin–valley
coupling and a great blue shift in PL. The spin–valley coupling
and purple PL are obtained with the ultrasmall lateral size of our
pristine WS2 QDs. All of the results afford these ultrasmall
monolayered QDs various applications in optoelectronics, spintronics,
valleytronics, and so on.

Methods
Materials
a-WS2 QDs were
purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. Sulfur powder
(99.998% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd.

Sample Preparation
a-WS2 QDs (100 mg) and 1 g of sulfur powder were put in
two quartz boats, respectively. They were then placed inside a quartz
tube in sequence with sulfur powder on the upstream of the gas flow.
Before heating in a tubular furnace, the tube was emptied by a vacuum
pump and fed with Ar several times to ensure that there is no residual
oxygen. After that, the restoration process was performed at 450 °C
for 30 min with Ar flow at 20 sccm. Finally, annealed WS2 QDs were collected after cooling down to room temperature.

Sample Characterizations
The morphologies
were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai-F20)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco dimension 3100). X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on PHI-5000 VersaProbe
using Al Kα radiation. Raman spectra were obtained by a confocal
Raman microscope (LabRAM Aramis, Japan) using a laser excitation of
532 nm. The extinction and PL spectra were recorded at ambient conditions
by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600, Japan) and
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5301PC, Japan), respectively.
For optical spectrum investigation, samples were prepared at a concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL using NMP and were ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h.
