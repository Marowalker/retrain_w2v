Major
barriers to the implementation of nanotechnology include
reproducible synthesis and scalability. Batch solution phase methods
do not appear to have the potential to overcome these barriers. Microfluidic
methods have been investigated as a means to enable controllable and
reproducible synthesis; however, the most popular constituent of microfluidics,
polydimethylsiloxane, is ill-suited for mass production. Multi-inlet
vortex mixers (MIVMs) have been proposed as a method for scalable
nanoparticle production; however, the control and reproducibility
of the nanoparticle is wanting. Here, we investigate the ability to
improve the control and reproducibility of nanoparticles produced
by using 3D printed MIVMs with herringbone patterns in the flow channels.
We compare three methods, viz., microfluidic, MIVM, and herringbone-patterned
MIVM methods, for the synthesis of lipid–polymer hybrid nanoparticles
(LPHNPs). The 3D printed herringbone-patterned MIVM method resulted
in the smallest LPHNPs with the most uniform size distribution and
shows more reproducible results as compared to the other two methods.
To elucidate the mechanism underlying these results, concentration
slices and vorticity streamlines of mixing chambers have been analyzed
for 3D printed herringbone-patterned MIVM devices. The results bode
well for LPHNPs, a formulation widely investigated for its improved
therapeutic efficacy and biocompatibility. The herringbone-patterned
device also has the potential to be broadly applied to many solution
phase processes that take advantage of efficient mixing. The methods
discussed here have broad implications for reproducible production
of nanoparticles with constituents such as siRNA, proteins, quantum
dots, and inorganic materials.

==== Body
Introduction
Significant nanotechnology contributions
have been made to a myriad
of fields including information technology, medicine, energy, food
safety, and environmental science.1−5 In medicine, nanoparticles are poised to revolutionize the established
field of drug-delivery.6 A common technique
involves engineering nanoparticles to target and deliver drugs to
diseased cells. Targeted nanoparticle delivery is poised to significantly
reduce drug effects on healthy cells in the body and thereby reduce
the negative side-effects of the drug.7 Lipid–polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) consisting of
a hydrophobic polymer core and a lipid polymer shell represent a new
and promising nanoparticle drug-delivery platform because they provide
options for surface functionality, high drug loading yields, sustained
drug release profile, and excellent in vitro and in vivo stability.8−13

Conventional methods of synthesizing LPHNPs are time-consuming
and thus leave significant room for improvement. Some of these conventional
methods include emulsion formation, sonication, and solvent evaporation.14 The repeatability and reproducibility of these
methods is a translational concern as the synthesized nanoparticles
may show poor size distribution and low efficacy because of the lack
of fluidic control offered by these methods.15 Recent techniques such as microfluidics and multi-inlet vortex mixers
(MIVMs) enable rapid mixing and flash precipitation with precise control
of fluids yielding size- and structure-controlled LPHNPs.16,17 In addition to this, these methods are simple as well as cost-effective
as compared to other reported methods. With the advent of 3D printing,
significant control of fluidic parameters can be extended beyond channel
dimensions and basic geometry. It can include easily incorporated
patterns that can be used to alter fluid dynamics.

Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) is a common component for microfluidic
device fabrication because it is a cost-effective material; however,
PDMS is not well-suited for mass production because of the substantial
human labor and the layered molding that limits the 3D complexity
of the devices that can be produced.18 Silicon
substrates and glass have been proposed as alternatives but require
sophisticated fabrication processes that are cost- and access-prohibitive.
Despite the traction gained by the 3D printing of microfluidics, printing
resolution, throughput, and resin biocompatibility are common issues.
MIVMs have been demonstrated for scalable production; however, they
have the drawbacks of traditional bulk synthesis methods. Toward the
end of combining the advantages of microfluidics and MIVM systems,
we have explored herringbone-patterned 3D printed reactors.

Rifampicin-loaded LPHNPs (RLPHNPs) have been synthesized by the
three different fluidic methods: microfluidics, MIVM, and a 3D printed
MIVM with herringbone patterns. Rifampicin was chosen as the drug
as it has considerable potential for treatment of tuberculosis.19 Antibiotics for TB have many adverse side-effects
such as loss of appetite, nausea, and dizziness because of which many
of the patients discontinue the treatment, which ultimately results
in spreading of the disease. Hence, rifampicin-loaded nanoparticles
are of interest for increased patient adherence to tuberculosis drug
regimens. Primarily, effects of various parameters such as flow-rates
and encapsulation efficiency on the RLPHNP synthesis have been evaluated
systematically. On the basis of the obtained results, synthesis conditions
have been optimized to obtain RLPHNPs with desired shape, that is,
spherical, and size, ∼100 nm.

Further, the synthesis
of Myristic acid-loaded LPHNPs has also
been carried out by microfluidics, MIVM, and 3D printed MIVM with
herringbone pattern. Myristic acid has been chosen because it may
be an effective drug for cardiovascular diseases.20 The synthesis has been repeated five times keeping all
the synthesis and production parameters constant and comparison has
been made among these three methods on the basis of size and polydispersity
of LPHNPs. Nanoparticle composition and fabrications techniques used
in this study help to narrow down the formulation and methods for
the production of LPHNPs for possible preclinical and drug delivery
applications in the future.

Device Fabrication
Microfluidic Device Fabrication
The microfluidic device
design was prepared by using AutoCAD with the appropriate dimensions
as shown in Figure 1A. A silicon wafer was coated with an SU-8 coating (protective coating)
in the shape of the microfluidic device and further used for fabrication.
Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer was used to create a mold for the microfluidic
device. To prepare the elastomeric mold of PDMS, silicone elastomer
base (Sylgard 184) and curing agent were mixed (10:1 ratio by weight)
and placed in a vacuum chamber to remove excess air bubbles. The PDMS
was poured onto the mold wafer and cured on a hot plate of 150 °C
for 10 min. The PDMS mold was then peeled off from the wafer. The
microfluidic device was cut out from the PDMS mold with a razor blade,
punched with holes for the inlets and outlets, and bonded onto a glass
slide with plasma treatment. Plasma treatment was applied at a medium
level for 30 s. The fabricated microfluidic device and the experimental
setup for the microfluidic device is shown in Figure 1B,C, respectively.

microfluidic device (units are in millimeters);
(B) fabricated microfluidic device; (C) experimental setup for the
microfluidic device; (D) schematic for the MIVM design; (E) fabricated
MIVM device; and (F) experimental setup for the MIVM device.

MIVM Device Fabrication
A modeling program called SolidWorks
was utilized to design the MIVM device. The design was based on the
design created by Liu et al. and the dimensions were approximate to
the values indicated in various literature papers.21,22 The external and internal geometry of the device is shown in Figure 1D,E, including four
holes where the inlet fittings were tapped, the inlet channels that
lead from the inlets to the mixing chamber; the mixing chamber where
the reactants mix; and the hole where the outlet fitting was tapped.
After the three-dimensional model was complete, the SolidWorks file
was used by a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machinist to create
the Teflon prototype. Figure 1F shows the experimental setup for the MIVM device.

3D Printed
MIVM with Herringbone Pattern Fabrication
In a 3D printed
MIVM device, a herringbone pattern was incorporated
into the bottom surface of the inlet channels. The pictorial representation
of MIVM without and with the herringbone pattern is shown in Figure 2A–C. The herringbone
pattern consisted of repeated patterns of grooves on the bottom of
the microchannel. The individual groove was composed of channels of
two different lengths connected to each other, one relatively longer
and the other relatively shorter, and those two grooves meet with
a certain angle. The herringbone pattern follows the direction of
the flow and spans the full width of the inlet channel with the arms
of the chevrons offset in length by a 2:1 ratio as shown in Figure 2D. The herringbone
geometries are loosely based on designs by Manda and are scaled up
from the micrometer scale, which are also given in Figure 2D.23 The 3D printed MIVM devices were made in four different variations
with three devices having different distances between the herringbone
grooves (600, 750, and 900 μm) and one without a herringbone
pattern as the control (Figure 2B). On the basis of the study conducted by Chan et al., a
mixing chamber size of 4 mm was determined as the most optimum size
for mixing efficiency.24 The isometric
view of the MIVM device used for incorporating the herringbone pattern
is shown in Figure 2E. Once device modeling was completed, a 3D printer was used to physically
create the device. The experimental setup used for the MIVM device
with the herringbone pattern is shown in Figure 2F.

and (C) with the herringbone
pattern; (D) schematic representation of the herringbone pattern (all

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of RLPHNPs by the Microfluidic Method
One
of the newly applied methods for fabricating core–shell-type
hybrid NPs is the microfluidic method. In the microfluidic device,
a polymer with the drug solution was introduced from the middle inlet
and the lipid solution was introduced from the two side inlets. At
the outlet chamber, the lipid shell was adsorbed onto the surface
of the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) core through hydrophobic
interaction between the aliphatic chain of the lipid and PLGA, to
form the lipid–PLGA core–shell NP.25 Initially, to optimize the production parameters, synthesis
of LPHNPs was attempted with variable drug-loading amounts and flow
rates.

The effects of different flow rates through the microfluidic
device were observed and recorded under a light microscope using dyed
water. Figure 3A–F
shows the effect of different flow rates applied to the side channels,
whereas the flow rate of the middle channel was kept constant at 0.1
mL/min. As can be noted from Figure 3A–C, as the flow rate of the side channels increased,
the water flow of the middle channel becomes narrow. This may be due
to increased pressure from the outside flow, which pushes the flow
into the mixing channel. However, when the flow rate of the outside
channel was increased to 20 times that of the middle channel (more
than 2 mL/min), the flow from the middle channel began to spread outwards
toward the edges to compensate for the low pressure created at the
inlet of the side channel by the high flow rate. This can be clearly
observed from Figure 3D–F. At a flow rate of 4, 6, and 8 mL/min, microvortices began
to form, which is indicated by the large spread of the dyed water
across the channel in a parabolic manner. This pattern was maintained
as long as the flow rate ratio was steady, indicating that the flow
was not random but a controlled turbulence.

rates of side channels. (a–d) Flow images of fluorescein-dyed

of RLPHNPs (n = 3).

The microvortices within the microfluidic channel can be
better
explained using a fluorescent microscope with fluorescein dyed water,
which is shown in Figure 3a–d. As the flow rate of the outside channels increased,
the flow in the middle channel initially narrows, but begins to increase
from the different flow pressures, and eventually creates a controlled
turbulence as seen in the circular vortices in Figure 3d. Moreover, the decrease in the intensity
of the dye flowing from the middle channel can be observed in Figure 3b–d, which
is indicated by the white arrows. This indicates that the solution
from the middle channel is mixing with the solution flowing from the
side channels, causing the dye to dilute dramatically within a distance
of a few millimeters in the mixing channel. It is clear from Figure 3A–D,a–d
that thorough mixing and thereby the nanoprecipitation of solutions
would occur at flow rates higher than 4 mL/min and higher in microfluidic
synthesis.

On the basis of these observations, flow rates of
4 mL/min and
higher than 4 mL/min were applied to the side channels and the diameter
of the corresponding RLPHNPs formed was measured by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) technique. Figure 3G displays the size of the RLPHNPs at various flow
rates. It can be noted from Figure 3G that the size of the LPHNPs decreases with increase
in the flow rates. The morphology of the RLPHNPs synthesized by using
12 mL/min flow rate is also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Figure 3H,I
depicts the TEM micrographs of RLPHNPs and the particle size distribution
observed from these micrographs is shown in Figure 3J. Figure 3H clearly shows that the nanoparticles are mostly spherical
with two distinct layers, inside the polymer core with a lighter contrast
to the outer lipid shell dyed to a darker hue. A closer view of the
RLPHNPs is shown in Figure 3I. The lipid shell thickness of the LPHN was measured to be
on average 5.4 nm, which is expected for a single-layer lipid shell.
However, there were few nanoparticles with s shell thickness of around
10 nm, suggesting that nanoparticles with bilipid shells may have
been synthesized in the process. The particle size distribution shown
in Figure 3J indicates
that most of the particles are between 70 and 80 nm. This shows a
clear resemblance with particle size measured by DLS technique at
a 12 mL/min flow rate.

The drug encapsulation efficiency of
LPHNPs highly depends upon
% of drug loaded in the nanoparticle. To optimize the loading capacity
of RLPHNPs, different amounts of Rifampicin were loaded in the RLPHNPs
and their corresponding encapsulation efficiency was measured and
is shown in Figure 3K. Figure 3K illustrates
the decrease in encapsulation efficiency as the concentration of the
drug loaded increases.

Synthesis of LPHNPs by MIVM (without the
Herringbone Pattern
Method)
MIVM is another one-step approach to prepare RLPHNPs.
In this approach, four turbulent jets of solvent and antisolvent enter
tangentially in a mixing chamber with 90° offset. The mixing
efficiency is highest when opposing streams have equal contributions
and flow rates.26 Hence, production parameters
such as flow rates and size of the mixing chambers affect the size
of LPHNPs. Accordingly, different flow rates have been applied to
all the four streams and the corresponding particle size is shown
in Figure 4A. Unlike
microfluidics, flow rates do not affect significantly the size of
the nanoparticle. However, the trend of decrease in particle size
with increasing the flow rates is followed in the MIVM technique also.
Along with the flow rates, the size of the mixing chambers also affects
the size of the RLPHNPs. Figure 4B,C shows variation in the size of the RLPHNPs corresponding
to the large (2.3 mm) and small size (1.3 mm) of the mixing chamber.
It is clear from Figure 4B,C that the large mixing chamber yielded a bigger RLPHNP particle
size of ∼250–150 nm, whereas the small mixing chamber
leads to the formation of smaller particles of 80–120 nm. Therefore,
it is clear from Figure 4A–C that flow rates of 12 or 16 mL/min and a 1.3 mm mixing
chamber would be ideal for the RLPHNPs by the MIVM device.

rates, (B) large mixing chamber, and (C) small mixing chamber. (D)

TEM images of RLPHNPs; (G) particle size distribution of RLPHNPs.

To analyze the encapsulation efficiency
of the RLPHNPs, different
amounts of rifampicin were loaded inside the PLGA core and their corresponding
encapsulation efficiency was measured. Figure 4D displays the encapsulation efficiency of
RLPHNPs with respect to the 5 and 10% of rifampicin, which is ∼70
and 60%, respectively. Figure 4E,F depicts the TEM micrograph of the RLPHNPs synthesized
using a 12 mL/min flow rate and 1.3 mm mixing chamber. Figure 4E,F indicates that RLPHNPs
are spherical with two distinct layers. A relatively dense inside
layer is the PLGA polymer core, whereas the outside layer represents
the  1, 2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-Poly(ethylene
glycol) (DSPE-PEG) lipid shell, which can be clearly seen in Figure 4F. The particle size
distribution of these nanoparticles (Figure 4G) shows that the particle size of RLPHNPs
ranges from 110 to 130 nm, which is in in good agreement with the
DLS measurement.

Synthesis of RLPHNP by a 3D Printed MIVM
with the Herringbone
Pattern
As mentioned in the previous section, MIVM has been
used to improve the efficiency and time of mixing a lipid and polymeric
solution by creating a turbulent vortex action at the center of the
device. However, the flows along the inlets in MIVM are fairly laminar.
In order to create a more turbulent flow in the inlets, a herringbone
design has been implemented.27 The herringbone
mixer is a passive mixer design which is capable of inducing a transverse
flow in the form of two counter rotating vortices as the primary mixing
mechanism.23,28 Unlike microfluidics and MIVM,
there are many other parameters such as herringbone spacing, outlet
mixing efficiency, average velocity, and average vorticity which affect
the particle size of RLPHNPs. Table 1 gives the outlet mixing efficiency, average velocity,
and average vorticity value at different herringbone spacings.

Table 1 Mixing Efficiency, Average Velocity,
and Average Vorticity Value at Different Herringbone Spacings
herringbone
spacing	outlet mixing
efficiency (%)	average velocity (m/s)	average
vorticity (1/s)	
no herringbone	99.18	0.04300	25.90	
900 μm	99.49	0.04253	28.35	
750	99.95	0.04258	28.40	
600	99.95	0.04266	28.49	
As can be seen from Table 1, the values of outlet
mixing efficiency and average velocity
hardly change with respect to the herringbone spacing. Figure 5A,B shows the concentration
slices of the mixing chamber and outlet of the MIVM device with and
without the herringbone pattern, respectively, at different flow rates.
The concentration slices are scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 and 1 are
separate opposing sample solutions and a perfect mixing efficiency
at the outlet would result in a value of 0.5. As can be seen from Figure 5A,B, mixing was observed
to be more efficient at the outlet and at the center of the mixing
chamber than the corners and edges of the mixing chamber. In addition
to this, the area of efficient mixing increases with increase in the
flow rates. This indicates that higher flow rates such as 12 and 16
mL/min are desirable for nanoparticle fabrication. There is no significant
difference observed between mixing efficiencies of the MIVM device
with and without the herringbone pattern; however, some blue patches
were observed at the corners of the mixing chamber (encircled in Figure 5B), which may correspond
to a slight lower value of mixing efficiency of MIVM without the herringbone
device.

device; (C) variation in particle size corresponding to the herringbone
spacing (n = 3). Vorticity streamlines of the mixing
chamber of the MIVM (D) without the herringbone and (E) with the herringbone
at 16 mL/min flow rate; (F) AFM image of RLPHNPs.

As can be noted from Table 1, average vorticity values are considerably higher
for the
herringbone-patterned MIVM devices. Vorticity describes the local
spinning motion of the continuum near the specific area/field (the
tendency of something to rotate).29 The
grooves in the herringbone pattern create helical motions of the moving
fluid inside the microchannel. This leads to the twisting patterns
of two liquid channels into each other at that point, resulting in
a higher vorticity value, which is also depicted by Figure 5D,E.30 The MIVM without the herringbone pattern shows uneven distribution
of vorticity values (encircled in Figure 5E). On the other hand, the herringbone-patterned
MIVM showed more prominent vorticity streamlines with uniform distribution.

Figure 5C gives
the variation in the particle size of RLPHNPs corresponding to different
herringbone spacings at the flow rate of 16 mL/min. It is clear from Figure 5 that a tight herringbone
spacing of 600 μm leads to the formation of the smallest RLPHNPs.
This can be attributed to the highest mixing efficiency and vorticity
values. Figure 5D shows
the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the RLPHNPs synthesized
with 600 μm and 16 mL/min flow rate. Figure 5D indicates the particle size of ∼53
nm, which matches well with the DLS measurement.

Comparison
among all Three Methods of LPHNP Synthesis
Finally, to compare
all the three synthesis methods, synthesis of
myristic acid-loaded LPHNPs has been carried out by microfluidics,
MIVM, and MIVM with herringbone methods. In this case, all the synthesis
and production parameters were kept constant for all the methods.
On the basis of the obtained results, flow rates of 12 mL/min and
drug amount of 5% have been employed during the synthesis in all the
three methods. In the case of MIVM, a 1.3 mm mixing chamber has been
used, whereas 600 μm spacing is used for MIVM with the herringbone
pattern. The synthesis has been repeated five times for each method
and the size of the resulting myristic acid-loaded LPHNPs have been
measured and are given in Figure 6. Particle sizes for all methods were observed to be
colloidally stable over 7 days.

Figure 6 (A) Variation in particle size and (B)
polydispersity of myristic
acid-loaded LPHNPs corresponding to different synthesis methods.

From Figure 6, the
average particle size obtained for microfluidics, MIVM, and MIVM with
the herringbone pattern device is 107, 199, and 74.5 nm, respectively.
It is clear from Figure 6A,B that the herringbone-patterned MIVM methods yield the smallest
particle size with uniform size distribution. It may be due to the
development of vortices in the grooves, which ultimately reduce the
relative volume of fluid that moved across the channel at high flow
rates.31. In addition to this,
it can be noted from Figure 6A that the herringbone-patterned MIVM method showed more reproducibility
and repeatability in the LPHNP synthesis than the other two methods.
This can be attributed to the good mixing efficiencies and controlled
microvortices taking place at the herringbone pattern grooves.32 Hence, the 3D printed herringbone-patterned
MIVM device represents a better approach for the synthesis of LPHNPs.
Moreover, the herringbone-patterned MIVM method appears to be general.
The herringbone-patterned reactor, microfluidics, and MIVM were used
to create lipid polymer-encapsulated quantum dots and the pattern
was the same as reported above. The herringbone-pattered MIVM produced
the most consistent particle sizes.

Conclusions
LPHNPs
have been synthesized by microfluidics, MIVM, and 3D printed
herringbone-patterned MIVM methods. Initial experiments indicate that
higher flow rates of ∼12 mL/min yield smaller nanoparticles.
However, lesser drug loading (5%) gives better drug encapsulation.
Considering these parameters, myristic acid-loaded LPHNPs have been
synthesized by all the three methods, keeping all the parameters constant.
The results indicated that the 3D printed herringbone-patterned MIVM
methods give the smallest sized LPHNPs with uniform size distribution,
which is attributed to the enhanced mixing efficiency and vorticity
offered by this device. Along with this, the 3D printed herringbone-patterned
device was observed to give more reproducible and repeatable results
as compared to the other two methods. This simple, cost-effective,
and most reproducible method might be applicable for the controlled
synthesis of LPHNPs and rapid screening of nano-drug-delivery systems.

Materials
and Methods
The PLGA polymer was provided by Akina Chemicals
(West Lafayette,
IN, USA). The DSPE-PEG amine was supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL, USA). Lecithin (soybean, refined) was supplied by Alfa Aesar.
4% by weight aqueous ethanol, acetonitrile, and chloroform were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). For device fabrication, silicon
wafers were obtained from Silicon Quest International (San Jose, CA,
USA) Inc. SU-8-2035 and SU-8 developers were obtained from Microchem
Corporation (Westborough, MA, USA). Sylgard 181 Silicone Elastomer
Base was obtained from Dow Corning (Midland, Michigan, USA).

Synthesis of
RLPHNPs
The schematic used for the synthesis
of RLPHNPs is shown in Figure 7. Two separate solutions were used for the synthesis of RLPHNPs.
The first solution was the PLGA polymer dissolved in acetonitrile
(1 mg/mL) solution. An appropriate amount of rifampicin was mixed
with this PLGA solution (5, 10, and 20%), which forms the core of
the RLPHNPs. The second solution was lecithin/DESPE-PEG (1:2.5) lipid
solution, which forms the shell of the nanoparticle. In the case of
the lipid solution, the formulations for these methods differ slightly.
In the case of microfluidics and MIVM with herringbone methods, DSPE-PEG/lecithin
was dissolved in chloroform first. After evaporating the chloroform
in vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 4% ethanol and heated to a
temperature of 65 °C with a hot plate. In the MIVM method, DSPE-PEG/lecithin
was dissolved in water and was not heated at 65 °C as this formulation
was considered to be temperature-independent. These two solutions
were then applied to the inlets of microfluidics, MIVM, and 3D printed
herringbone-patterned MIVM devices with variable flow rates. The obtained
nanoparticles were then washed with distilled water using 30 kDa pore
tangential flow filtration MicroKros apparatus.

Figure 7 Schematic for LPHNP synthesis.

Synthesis of Myristic Acid-Loaded
LPHNPs
In the case
of myristic acid-loaded LPHNPs, all the synthesis parameters were
kept constant for all the three methods. Two solutions were prepared
for the synthesis: solution-A consisted of the PLGA polymer core dissolved
in acetonitrile (1 mg/mL) along with an appropriate amount of myristic
acid (5%). Solution-B is the lipid-shell solution. To prepare this
solution, chloroform containing dissolved lecithin was added to the
chloroform containing DSPE-PEG solution. The resulting solution was
then placed in a vacuum chamber to allow chloroform to evaporate,
leaving a thin film of lecithin and DSPE-PEG. Then, the resulting
dry residue were suspended in 4% ethanol before the solution was heated
to 65 °C. These two solutions were then applied to the inlets
of microfluidics, MIVM, and a 3D printed MIVM with the herringbone-patterned
device at a fixed rate of 12 mL/min. Finally, synthesized nanoparticles
were then washed with distilled water and filtered using a 30 kDa
pore tangential flow filtration MicroKros apparatus. All the LPHNPs
were characterized by DLS, AFM, and TEM imaging techniques.

Characterization
Techniques
The average particle size
of the nanoparticles was calculated using DLS technique on NanoBrook
90Plus Particle Analyzer. Each DLS measurement is repeated at least
three times and mean value is presented in the report. Standard deviation
calculated from these values have been shown as error bars. AFM analysis
was done using a 5500 Atomic Force Microscope by Keysight Technologies.
TEM imaging of the nanoparticles was performed at the NASA AMES facility
using a Hitachi H-9500 System (operating voltage of the system was
300 kV). COMSOL software was utilized to stimulate and analyze various
fluidic properties of the herringbone-patterned 3D printed MIVM device.
Encapsulation efficiency was calculated from % EE = [(drug added –
free “unentrapped drug”)/drug added] × 100. The
drug loading is 10 or 15% the weight of the PLGA, which represents
10 or 15% drug loading. These measurements were performed in triplicate,
and the standard deviation calculated from the obtained results have
been shown in the figures in the form of error bars.
