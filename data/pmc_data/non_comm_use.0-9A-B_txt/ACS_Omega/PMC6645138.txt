Development
of a stable catalyst that can efficiently function
for longer time for energy conversion process in water splitting is
a challenging work. Here, NiCo2O4/NiO nanosheets
are successfully synthesized following a simple wet-chemical route,
followed by the combustion technique. Finally, the synthesized catalyst
NiCo2O4/NiO can function as an efficient catalyst
for oxygen evolution reaction. Nanosheets with interconnections are
very useful for better electron transportation because the pores in
between the sheets are useful for the diffusion of electrolyte in
electrocatalysis. In oxygen evolution reaction, these sheets can generate
current densities of 10 and 20 mA/cm2, respectively, upon
application of 1.59 and 1.62 V potential versus reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE) under alkaline condition. In contrast, bare NiCo2O4 nanowire bundles can generate a current density
of 10 mA/cm2 upon application of 1.66 V versus RHE. The
presence of NiO in NiCo2O4/NiO nanosheets helps
to increase the conductivity, which further increases the electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4/NiO nanosheets.

1 Introduction
Most
important and immerging challenge is to find “green”
and “renewable” energy resources due to the inadequate
availability of fossil fuel and day-to-day increasing energy demand
for everyday life, and at the same time, conventional energy sources
have many environmental emission issues. Water splitting has attracted
great interest in recent years because only by application of current
it can generate hydrogen and oxygen.1 Hydrogen
resulting from the production of electricity from renewable sources,
such as solar or wind, will have advantages from emissions benefits.
On earth, it is unlikely to transpire hydrogen naturally in large
quantities. For the industrial production of hydrogen, substantial
amount of energy is required. Solar water splitting for the production
of hydrogen as an energy carrier using only water and sunlight on
the earth is extremely attractive. A large overpotential of oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) restricts the practical application of water
splitting.2 The important challenge for
oxygen production is to unveil a way by which the cost of production
technologies can be minimized and it can be commercialized. Precious
metals are efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but their practical ability
is bounded because of the low availability, high cost, and stability
issue. Precious metal oxides like RuO2 and IrO2 are studied as efficient OER and Pt as HER catalyst having low onset
potential.3 It is obvious to design an
effective and economical catalyst using non-noble metals, which can
function as an efficient OER or HER catalyst with high durability.

Metal oxides of Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe are developed and frequently
studied for their OER activity.4 Cobalt-based
oxides are most promising electrocatalysts because of their high abundance,
easy preparation, and stability.5a Metal-doped Co3O4 shows improved electrocatalytic
activity compared to bare Co3O4.23b,23c Among these non-noble-metal-based catalysts, NiCo2O4 has received considerable attention in oxygen evolution reaction
because of its better electronic and ionic conductivity, low cost,
stability, and so forth.6,7 In NiCo2O4, the octahedral sites are filled with nickel, and cobalt
occupies both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Redox chemistry
of NiCo2O4 is rich because of the dual contribution
of nickel and cobalt. Recent studies have demonstrated that NiCo2O4 has excellent electrochemical activity and electronic
conductivity, which are always higher than those of the counter monometallic
oxides (NiO and Co3O4).8 Different morphologies of NiCo2O4 were extensively
studied for its OER activity. Xiao et al. reported the synthesis of
NiCo2O4 nanosheets, which can generate a current
density of 10 mA/cm2 upon application of 1.63 V potential
versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 1 M KOH condition.9 The electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4 nanosheets decorated on CNTs, which is much higher
than that of bare NiCo2O4, was reported by Chen
et al.7 Yan et al. reported that Fe-doped
NiCo2O4 shows higher electrocatalytic activity
compared to NiCo2O4 in 1 M KOH. Bare NiCo2O4 requires 1.69 V to generate a current density
of 10 mA/cm2 with a Tafel slope of 75 mV/decade.10

Sheet like structure with high active
surface atoms can function
as efficient catalyst for OER reaction. Umeshbabu et al. exhibited
enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER and methanol oxidation
when NiCo2O4 hexagonal plates were attached
to reduced graphene oxide sheets, with high surface area.11Xia et al. reported Au–NiCo2O4 supported on a graphene-like sheet, where the latter
is introduced as a conductive support to increase the specific area
and helps to improve the conductivity of NiCo2O4.12 Similarly, NiCo2O4 nanosponges exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER
reaction, as shown by Zhu et al.13 Motivated
by previous studies, in the present report, two-dimensional (2D) sheets
of NiCo2O4/NiO are synthesized using a wet-chemical
route, followed by calcination technique. The structure, composition,
and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
Raman spectroscopy, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. NiCo2O4/NiO sheets can function as efficient catalyst for OER
reaction under alkaline condition. In oxygen evolution reaction, NiCo2O4/NiO sheets can generate a current density of
10 mA/cm2 upon application of 1.59 V potential versus RHE.
It was found that NiCo2O4/NiO sheets can outperform
commercial RuO2, exhibiting a small potential of 1.59 V
at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel value
of 61 mV/decade during OER in 1 M NaOH.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
For
the synthesis of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets, 2.0 mL
of NiCl2 (0.1
mol/L) and 4 mL of Co(NO3)2 (0.1 mol/L) solutions
were mixed together with certain amount of urea and glucose. The mixture
was stirred and heated at 140 °C for 6 h, followed by calcination
at 500 °C for 30 min to 15 h in air. A similar type of methodology
for the synthesis of monometallic oxides was reported by Zhou et al.14 More details of the experimental steps are given
in Experimental Section. Bare NiCo2O4 was separately synthesized via hydrothermal technique
(details are given in Experimental Section). Bare NiO was also synthesized using the wet-chemical technique,
followed by combustion (details are given in Experimental
Section). A physical mixture of NiCo2O4 and NiO was also prepared by mixing NiCo2O4 (synthesized through hydrothermal technique) and NiO in the composition
ratio 1:0.13, denoted as NiCo2O4–NiO
pm throughout the MS.

2.2 Morphology and Structure
The crystal
structure, composition, and phase purity of the as-synthesized material
were initially characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. Scheme 1 shows the schematic
representation of the synthesis of NiCo2O4/NiO
sheets, Figure 1a shows
the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized material. All peaks are well
matched with the cubic NiCo2O4 (JCPDS No.: 20-0781)15 and cubic NiO (JCPDS No.: 73-1519).16 There is no unidentified peak in the XRD pattern,
which again clearly demonstrates that the synthesized product is NiCo2O4 with NiO. To know the growth mechanism, time-dependent
XRD was carried out. Figure S1a shows the
XRD pattern of Ni–Co sample before calcination, where no characteristic
peak was identified leaving aside the amorphous peak of “C”.
So, after heating at 140 °C for 6 h, only metal ions get embedded
on spongy “C” surface. XRD was carried out at different
time intervals of calcination, such as 30 min, 3, 6, 10, and 15 h,
and the results are shown in Figure S1a,b. After 3 h of calcination, XRD shows the presence of NiO along with
NiCo2O4. With further increase in calcination
time, NiO gets converted to NiCo2O4 as the peak
intensity of NiO certainly decreased on 6 h calcination. Finally,
the XRD pattern of the 10 h sample clearly shows that there is only
13% NiO present in NiCo2O4. Again, calcination
up to 15 h exhibits enhanced amount of NiO in NiCo2O4, which may be due to the decomposition of NiCo2O4 upon longer heating.17 So,
the optimum condition for calcination is 10 h to get minimum amount
of NiO on NiCo2O4. The XRD pattern of NiCo2O4 synthesized by hydrothermal method and NiO is
shown in Figure S2.

spectra of NiCo2O4/NiO, bare NiCo2O4, and bare NiO.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Synthesis of NiCo2O4/NiO Sheets
The existence of NiO in NiCo2O4/NiO
can be
clearly identified by Raman spectroscopy. Figure 1b displays the Raman spectra of NiCo2O4/NiO, pure NiO, and NiCo2O4. In case of NiO, two main peaks are observed centered at 505 and
1074 cm–1, which are due to one phonon (1P) mode
and two phonon (2P) modes of two longitudinal-optical (2LO), respectively.18 Pure NiCo2O4 shows peaks
at 194, 467, 519, and 672 cm–1, which are due to
F2g, Eg, LO, and A1g modes of NiCo2O4, respectively.19 The
Raman spectra of NiCo2O4/NiO show peaks at 190,
467, 515, 665, and 1077 cm–1, which clearly demonstrate
the presence of both NiO and NiCo2O4 in the
as-synthesized NiCo2O4/NiO.

The morphology
of the as-synthesized product was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figures 2a,b and S3 show
the SEM images of NiCo2O4/NiO in different magnifications.
The low-magnification image shows that highly dense interconnected
nanosheets of NiCo2O4 are synthesized following
this method. These interconnected sheets are very useful for better
electron transportation because the pores in between the sheets are
useful for the diffusion of electrolyte in electrocatalysis. Lengths
of these sheets are in the range of micrometers, whereas widths are
in nanometers. A high-magnification SEM image of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets is shown in the inset of Figure 2b, which shows that very small nanoparticles
work as the building blocks to give rise to nanosheet-like morphology.
The presence and distribution of the elements in the nanosheet structure
were characterized using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and
the results are shown in Figure S4, which
confirms the presence of Ni, Co, and O as elements. Figure S5 shows the uniform distribution of Ni, Co, and O
throughout the nanosheet structure.

Figure 2 (a, b) Field-emission SEM (FESEM) images
of NiCo2O4/NiO in different magnifications:
(a) low magnification and
(b) medium magnification, which shows that the as-synthesized materials
have the nanosheet morphology; the inset shows the high-magnification
SEM image, which shows that the small particles of NiCo2O4/NiO arranged themselves to give rise to the sheet like
structure. (c) TEM image of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets,
and the inset shows the high-magnification TEM image. (d) HRTEM image
of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also used to determine
the crystallinity and to recheck the morphology. Figures 2c and S6 show the TEM images of the synthesized NiCo2O4/NiO, which confirm the sheet like structure consistent
with the SEM image. The inset of Figure 2c shows a high-magnification TEM image, which
confirms that the as-synthesized nanosheets are composed of very small
particles with particle size ∼50 nm. HRTEM analysis (Figure 2d) shows the interplanar
spacing of about 0.25 nm, which corresponds to the spacing between
two (311) crystal planes of NiCo2O4.20Figure S7a,b shows
the TEM images (in different magnifications) of bare NiCo2O4 synthesized through hydrothermal method. It shows that
bundles of NiCo2O4 nanowire were synthesized
following hydrothermal technique. HRTEM analysis of NiCo2O4 bundles exhibits an interplanar spacing of 0.25 nm,
which corresponds to the spacing of (311) plane (Figure S7c). EDS analysis shows the presence of Ni, Co, and
O and their homogeneous distribution throughout the nanowire bundle
(Figure S8).

To have a clear understanding
on the composition and oxidation
of the metals present in NiCo2O4/NiO, XPS was
carried out, and the results are shown in Figure 3. Survey spectra are shown in Figure 3a, which shows the presence
of Ni, Co, C, and O and the absence of any impurity. High-resolution
spectra of Ni 2p can be fitted with two spin–orbit doublets
and two shakeup satellite peaks. These two spin–orbit doublets
are of Ni2+ and Ni3+, and the two shakeup satellite
peaks are assigned as “sat” in Figure 3b. Specifically, peaks at binding energies
of 854.5 and 872.3 eV are assigned to Ni3+ and other two
peaks at 858.4 and 877.8 eV are of Ni2+. In a similar way,
Co 2p is also fitted, the doublet peaks at binding energies of 779.1
and 794.7 eV are assigned to Co3+, and peaks at 780.6 and
796.6 eV are due to Co2+ species (Figure 3c). XPS results indicate that NiCo2O4/NiO contains Ni2+/Ni3+ and at
the same time Co2+/Co3+. The observed XPS result
is in accordance with the existing literature.11 O 1s spectra show only two contributions, which are denoted
as O1 centered at 529.1 eV and O2 at 530.1 eV (Figure 3d). Specifically, the peak located at 529.1
eV is assigned due to the metal–oxygen bond. The peak at 530.1
eV is usually associated with defects and contaminants. There is no
peak beyond 531 eV, which again proves that there is no chemisorbed
oxygen in the material, which is in agreement with our experimental
procedure.

O 1s.

2.3 Electrocatalytic
Activity
The electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4/NiO was evaluated using
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). All of the electrochemical measurements
for oxygen evolution reaction were carried out in 1 M NaOH solution. Figure 4 shows the polarization
curve of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets, bare NiCo2O4, NiO, RuO2, and bare glassy carbon (GC)
electrode measured at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. Potentials are measured
with respect to Ag/AgCl electrode and reported with respect to reversible
hydrogen electrode. Bare GC does not show any catalytic activity in
the measured potential range. If the scan rate is high, i.e., 50 mV/s,
it is observed that NiCo2O4/NiO sheets exhibit
two anodic oxidation peaks (Figure S9).
The first peak is centered at 1.42 V, and the second one is at 1.55
V: the first peak is due to the oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+, and the second peak is due to the oxidation of water. This
result is consistent with the literature.13 In the spinel structure, nickel is present in the octahedral site,
whereas cobalt is present in both the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.
During electrocatalysis, the presence of a peak at 1.42 V signifies
that Co4+ is the main active species in the NiCo2O4/NiO. That is why, peaks of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Co2+ to Co3+ are missing in the
LSV scan. It is noted that NiCo2O4/NiO sheets
can generate current densities of 10 and 20 mA/cm2 upon
application of 1.59 and 1.62 V potentials, respectively (Figure 4a,b). Current density
successively increases with the increase in applied potential. NiCo2O4/NiO sheets are catalytically more active for
OER compared to bare NiCo2O4 and NiO (Figure 4a). Bare NiCo2O4 requires 1.66 V to generate a current density
of 10 mA/cm2, whereas NiO requires 1.77 V. It is also clear
from this result that the electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4 is better compared to that of NiO. The catalytic activity
of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets is also compared to the
physical mixture of NiO and NiCo2O4 having the
same composition ratio. It is observed that the physical mixture sample
shows higher electrocatalytic activity compared to bare NiCo2O4 and bare NiO. NiCo2O4–NiO
pm required 1.60 V to generate a current density of 10 mA/cm2 (Figure S10). The electrocatalytic efficiency
of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets was compared to that of
RuO2. In the present reaction condition, RuO2 can generate current densities of 10 and 20 mA/cm2 upon
application of 1.58 and 1.64 V versus RHE (Figure 4a,b), respectively, which also shows that
the electrocatalytic activities of the NiCo2O4/NiO sheets are comparable to RuO2. Nonfaradic capacitive
current allied with electrochemical double-layer charging current
is calculated first, and from that, electrochemically active surface
area (ECSA) of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets and NiCo2O4 is determined. Figure S11a,b shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve recorded in the potential
of 1.025–1.225 V versus RHE applying different scan rates in
1 M NaOH. From the CV curves, double-layer charging current is measured
at a potential of 1.125 V versus RHE and plotted against scan rate.
A straight line is observed, from the slope of which, Cdl (double-layer capacitance) can be calculated, and the
values are 0.479 and 0.200 mF for NiCo2O4/NiO
sheets and NiCo2O4, respectively (Figure S11c). The ECSA are calculated to be 7.89
and 3.34 cm2, and the roughness factors are 112 and 47,
respectively. Higher ECSA and roughness factor further strengthen
the fact that the interconnected sheet like structure of NiCo2O4/NiO has increased surface area and that a certain
percentage of NiO plays an important role to enhance the electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4. At potential 1.65 V versus
RHE, mass activities of NiCo2O4/NiO, NiO, and
NiCo2O4 were calculated to be 29.31, 8.05, and
1.40 A/g, respectively. Mass activity of NiCo2O4/NiO is higher compared to others, which reflects its higher catalytic
activity. Specific activity (from ECSA surface area)21,22 was also calculated for both NiCo2O4/NiO and
NiCo2O4, and the values are shown in Table 1. Higher mass and
specific activities of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets reflect
the higher catalytic activity. Intrinsic catalytic activity of the
synthesized catalysts was further evaluated from turnover frequency
(TOF), accepting that all of the metal atoms present on the electrode
surface are catalytically active. TOF was calculated for NiCo2O4/NiO, bare NiCo2O4, and
bare NiO at a fixed potential of 1.65 V versus RHE. Calculated TOF
values are shown in Table 1. It is observed that NiCo2O4/NiO catalyst
exhibits the highest TOF of ∼1.4 × 10–2 s–1 at a potential of 1.65 V versus RHE, which
is 2.8 times higher than bare NiCo2O4 and 70
times higher than bare NiO. This result suggests that NiCo2O4/NiO can serve as an efficient and stable catalyst for
water oxidation.

NiCo2O4	1.66	8.05	139	0.179	0.005	
NiO	1.77	1.40	101	 	0.0002	
To judge the superior electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets, values of Tafel
slope were determined from
the polarization curve. Figure 4d evidently shows that NiCo2O4/NiO has
a Tafel slope value of 61 mV/decade, which is lower compared to bare
NiCo2O4 (139 mV/decade, Figure 4d) and NiO (101 mV/decade). This also signifies
that NiO present in NiCo2O4 helps to enhance
the electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4. NiCo2O4/NiO-3 h is more active compared to NiCo2O4/NiO-15 h (Figure S12). The remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity may be attributed
to the interconnected sheet like structure, which is helpful for ready
charge transportation and also offers electrolyte to penetrate inside
and easily contact with the active centers of the catalyst. NiCo2O4 has the spinel structure with more active sites,
and NiO offers higher conductivity to NiCo2O4. Long-term durability of the NiCo2O4/NiO sheets
was checked up to 500 cycles for OER. Result show that there is 100%
current retention (Figure S13), which proves
that the as-synthesized NiCo2O4/NiO sheets are
stable. The stability of NiCo2O4/NiO was determined
at a fixed potential of 1.64 V versus RHE up to 11 h, and the plots
are shown in Figure 5. From Figure 5, it
is very clear that the NiCo2O4/NiO can show
unaltered current density up to 11 h under experimental condition.
To gain insight into the superb performance for providing unaltered
current density for longer period, PXRD and SEM analyses were carried
out after electrocatalysis. From the PXRD pattern, it is clear that
the electrode material remains in the same phase as before, and is
shown in Figure S14. Figure S15 shows the SEM analysis data of the electrode material,
which confirm that the morphologies of NiCo2O4/NiO are all well maintained. We have made a detailed comparison,
where NiCo2O4 was used as OER catalyst, and
the results are shown in Table S1. Electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4/NiO is comparable to the
existing literature.

Figure 5 i–t data recorded
on NiCo2O4/NiO at a fixed potential of 1.64
V vs RHE in
1 M NaOH solvent.

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried
out to know the feasibility of the charge transportation on the electrode
surface. Semicircle observed in the Nyquist plots can be fitted with
an equivalent circuit, which is composed of Rs (solution resistance), constant-phase element, and RCT (charge-transfer resistance). Values of Rs and RCT are dependent
on the electrocatalytic activity of the material, and lower the value
faster is the reaction kinetics. Impedance result is shown in Figure 4c and the inset of Figure 4c. In case of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets, it is observed that Rs = 12.09 Ω and RCT =
29.36 Ω. The Rs values of NiCo2O4 and NiO are 15.88 and 16.77 Ω, respectively,
which reflect that the solution resistance is higher for both the
samples compared to NiCo2O4/NiO sheets. The RCT values of NiCo2O4 and
NiO are 100 and 667 Ω, respectively, which are higher compared
to NiCo2O4/NiO sheets. Lower charge-transfer
resistance means higher conductivity, which is in accordance with
the electrocatalysis data. To compare the electrocatalytic activity,
EIS analysis of NiCo2O4–NiO pm is also
carried out, which shows that the solution resistance is 18.39 and
the charge-transfer resistance is 50.7 Ω (Figure S10). All the Rs and RCT values are shown in Table 2. This result also suggests that in the presence
of little amount of NiO in NiCo2O4, even though
in physical mixture, conductivity increases. A low RCT of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets suggests
that NiCo2O4/NiO is electrocatalytically very
active.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a way to synthesize NiCo2O4 interconnected sheet like structure with ∼13%
NiO. This novel 2D interconnected sheet like structure exhibits excellent
electrocatalytic activity toward OER reaction. On the basis of our
literature survey, there is no report for the electrocatalytic activity
of NiCo2O4/NiO sheets, which shows improved
catalytic activity compared to bare NiCo2O4.
NiCo2O4/NiO sheets can generate a current density
of 10 mA/cm2 upon application of 1.59 V versus RHE only.
NiCo2O4/NiO shows excellent stability under
OER condition. Certain percentage of NiO present in NiCo2O4 results in faster charge transportation, which leads
to higher catalytic activity toward OER compared to bare NiCo2O4 and NiO.

Instrumentation,
and Methods
4.1 Synthesis of NiCo2O4/NiO Sheets
Following a simple wet-chemical route, NiCo2O4/NiO was synthesized. Co(II)-nitrate hexahydrate
and Ni(II)-chloride hexahydrate were used as the precursor of cobalt
and nickel, respectively. Ni(II)-chloride hexahydrate (2 mL, 0.1 mol/L)
was thoroughly mixed with 4 mL of 0.1 mol/L Co(II)-nitrate hexahydrate.
Then, to this, 5 g of glucose and 1 g of urea were added and mixed.
This mixture was stirred and heated at 140 °C for 6 h in air.
After that, the black flocculated product was collected and calcined
at 500 °C for 10 h in air.

4.2 Synthesis
of NiCo2O4 via Hydrothermal Technique
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1.5 mmol) was
dissolved in 10 mL of water
and, on the other hand, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (3 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of water and mixed thoroughly.
Then, urea (54 mmol) was added with 40 mL of poly(ethylene glycol).
Then, hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 110 °C for 6 h.
Finally, the product was collected, washed with deionized water and
ethanol, and dried at 60 °C. Then, it was calcined at 300 °C
for 3 h and the final product was collected for further characterization
and application.

4.3 Synthesis of NiO Sheets
Following
a simple wet-chemical route, NiO was synthesized. Ni(II)-chloride
hexahydrate was used as the precursor of nickel. Ni(II)-chloride hexahydrate
(6 mL, 0.1 mol/L) was thoroughly mixed with 5 g of glucose and 1 g
of urea. This mixture was stirred and heated at 140 °C for 6
h in air. After that, the black flocculated product was collected
and calcined at 500 °C for 10 h in air.

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurement
Electrochemical
measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system. For oxygen
evolution reaction, 10 mL of 1 M NaOH was used as electrolyte. In
the cell, Ag/AgCl was used as reference electrode, Pt wire as the
counter electrode, and sample deposited on glassy carbon electrode
was used as the working electrode. All of the electrochemical data
were recorded in CHI604E (CH Instruments) at 25 °C. For oxygen
evolution reaction, the potential range was 0–0.8 V versus
Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 2 mV/s.

4.5 Preparation
of Working Electrode
Ink of NiCo2O4/NiO and NiCo2O4, NiO, NiCo2O4–NiO pm, and RuO2 was prepared by dispersing
5 mg of the sample in 300 μL
of 2-propanol. Then, 30 μL of Nafion was added as binder and
sonicated for 30 min to have a uniform dispersion. After that, 5 μL
of the dispersion was drop-casted carefully on GC electrode having
a diameter of 3 mm, which leads to a catalyst loading of 1.06 mg/cm2.

4.6 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance measurement was also performed in a three-electrode
system. Onset potentials of different materials were chosen as the
performing bias for this measurement with the sweeping of frequency
of 50 kHz to 1 Hz with a 10 mV alternating current dither.

4.7 Characterization of Materials
A Rigaku
MiniFlex II diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation was utilized
to monitor the powder X-ray diffraction pattern at a scanning rate
of 2°/min. Raman analysis was carried out using an Airix (STR
500) instrument. The morphology of the NiCo2O4/NiO, NiCo2O4 sample was investigated using
a Nova NanoSEM 450 field emission scanning electron microscope. Bruker
XFlash 6130, attached with an FESEM instrument, was used for EDS analysis.
The morphology of the NiCo2O4/NiO, NiCo2O4 sample was determined using transmission electron
microscopy (operated with a Bruker microscope). X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using a commercial Omicron
EA 125 source with Al Kα radiation (1486.7 eV). For all measurements,
the emission current of the X-ray source was fixed at 20 mA for an
anode voltage of 15 kV. High-resolution XPS images were collected
using a pass energy of 20 eV with a step size of 0.02 eV. The ultrahigh
vacuum chamber base pressure was maintained at <10–9 mbar throughout the measurements. To compensate for any kind of
charging effect, the C 1s binding energy peak at 284.5 eV has been
used as a reference.

5 Calculation Method
Details of the calculations of mass activity and specific activity
are given below. The mass activity (A/g) was calculated from the catalyst
loading and the observed current density (mA/cmgeo2) at a potential of 1.65 V versus RHE.  The specific activity is calculated by normalizing
the current at a fixed potential (1.65 V vs RHE) by the electrochemically
active surface area.  TOF value was calculated for NiCo2O4/NiO, NiCo2O4, and NiO assuming
that every metal atom is taking part in the catalysis reaction.  where 4 means
four electrons are required
to generate 1 mol of O2 from H2O, F is the Faraday constant (96 485.3 C/mol), and n is the moles of metal atoms present on the electrode surface. The
value of n is calculated from the molecular weight
of the compound and the amount of catalyst present on the electrode
surface.
