A chiral pool protocol toward the
synthesis of the smenamide family
of natural products is described. Two stereoisomers of smenamide A,
namely, ent-smenamide A and 16-epi-smenamide A were synthesized with a 2.6 and 2.5% overall yield,
respectively. Their carboxylic acid moieties were assembled starting
from S-citronellene via two Wittig reactions and
a Grignard process. Its coupling with either (S)-
or (R)-dolapyrrolidinone, synthesized from Boc-l-Phe and Boc-d-Phe, respectively, was accomplished
by using the Andrus protocol. This work also established the previously
unknown relative and absolute configurations of smenamide A.

Introduction
Marine sponges are
considered to be one of the most productive
sources1 of novel scaffolds for use as
leads in antiinflammatory, immunomodulating, and anticancer drug research.2−4 Smenamides A (1) and B (2) (Figure 1) are chlorinated hybrid peptide/polyketide
metabolites isolated in microgram amounts from the Caribbean sponges Smenospongia aurea(5) and Smenospongia conulosa.6 The two smenamides differ only in the configuration of the C-13
double bond, which is E in smenamide A. Many of the
structural motifs in smenamides are usually found in cyanobacterial
metabolites, and it is likely that smenamides themselves are produced
by a cyanobacterial symbiont in the sponge. In particular, the vinyl
chloride function is shared with compounds such as jamaicamides7 and malingamides8 and
the recently isolated smenothiazoles9 and
conulothiazoles.6 The dolapyrrolidinone
terminus is a structural feature found, among others, in dolastatin-15,10 mycapolyols A–F,11 and belamide A.12 Smenamides are bioactive
substances and promising anticancer lead compounds. In particular,
smenamide A is strongly cytotoxic on lung cancer Calu-1 cells at nanomolar
concentrations5 through a clear proapoptotic
mechanism. Further pharmacological studies of smenamides were hampered
by the very limited amounts available, and total synthesis is a way
to overcome this problem. Here, we report an efficient chiral pool
convergent approach for the total synthesis of smenamides and its
analogues, which resulted in the synthesis of ent-smenamide A and 16-epi-smenamide A.

study.5

Results and Discussion
Smenamide A (1) contains
two stereogenic centers,
C-8 and C-16, whose configurations could not be assigned in the original
study.5 Therefore, before designing the
synthetic plan, the configuration at C-8 was determined using an improved
Marfey’s method.6,13 In particular, the phenylalanine
residue obtained from the degradation of smenamide A was found to
have the l configuration based on the liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC–MS) retention time of its 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alaninamide
(l-FDDA) derivative (see Figures S1 and S2). Determination of the configuration at C-16 is not trivial,
and indeed, this was one of the objectives of the present synthesis
work.

Smenamide A is a small but densely functionalized molecule
comprising
an N-methylacetamide, a chlorovinyl, and a tetramic
acid unit in its enol ether form engaged into a mixed imide bond with
an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid unit. A central point
in a synthetic plan toward smenamide A is the construction of the Z-chlorovinyl function. Various approaches have been used
to build this function in related substances,14 but relatively a few methods have been reported for the stereoselective
preparation of chloroolefins. Paige et al.15 used the palladium-mediated regio- and stereospecific silylstannylation
of a terminal alkyne16 to set the basis
for the stereoselectivity. However, the chlorodesilylation required
to generate the chlorovinyl moiety from the intermediate alkenylsilane
resulted in a moderate yield (42%), and similar results were obtained
by others,17a,17b with yields in the range 45–51%.
We envisioned that this approach, although elegantly conducted to
the required function in a stereoselective manner, would neither provide
any advantage in terms of the overall efficiency of the synthesis
nor decrease the need for chromatographic separations. The Wittig
olefination, on the other hand, has been reported to be an easy, efficient,
and direct process to build the chloroolefin function.14a−14d,14f Although this approach suffers
from the lack of stereoselectivity, sound precedents exist for the
photochemical isomerization of strictly related chloroolefins,14d opening the way to recycling the unwanted stereoisomer.
Therefore, we decided to include this latter reaction in our plan.

Our retrosynthetic analysis is depicted in Scheme 1. Disconnection of smenamide A at the mixed
imide function gave carboxylic acid 3 (C12–C27
fragment) and pyrrolinone 4 (C1–C11 fragment).
Further simplification of fragment 3 could be achieved
by the cleavage of the two carbon–carbon double bonds and the
C24–N bond. This led to the fully protected C15–C24
triol 5 as a versatile intermediate, where each alcohol
function could be transformed into one of the functional groups belonging
to fragment 3. The protecting groups in triol 5 were chosen in such a way that the tert-butyldimethylsilyl
(TBS), Bn, and tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) groups
could be selectively removed according to the order of installation
of the three functionalities, namely, first the N-methylacetamide, then the chlorovinyl function, and finally the
α,β-unsaturated acid unit. The presence of a methyl group
at C-16 in 5 suggested a further C20–C22 disconnection,
revealing the C15–C20 fragment 6 that was in turn
traced back to citronellene. The protected bromoalcohol 7 was recognized as the functionalized form of the remaining C22–C24
structural fragment. All this implied that in the synthetic direction,
two Wittig reactions, one of them E-selective (generating
the E C13−C15 bond), and a Grignard reaction
(generating the C20−C21 bond), could be used to build the whole
carbon skeleton of the acid moiety, starting from a suitably functionalized
C15–C20 fragment. It is important to say that the C-8 stereogenic
center in the dolapyrrolidinone moiety of smenamide A is prone to
racemization.18 Therefore, a racemization-free
synthetic route has been used18,19 to obtain fragment 4 starting from Meldrum’s acid and Boc-protected l-phenylalanine (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis of Smenamide A
As the configuration at C-16 in smenamide A
is unknown, the citronellene
enantiomer used as the starting material was arbitrarily chosen. Thus,
starting from the cheaper, commercially available S-citronellene, the C15–C20 fragment 6 was synthesized
as shown in Scheme 2. In particular, the chemoselective epoxidation of the trisubstituted
double bond, followed by acid-catalyzed epoxide opening and benzoylation
of the secondary alcohol function gave benzoate 8, as
a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers, in an 82% yield (over three steps).
The terminal olefin was dihydroxylated under Sharpless conditions
with OsO4 (catalyst)/N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO), and the obtained diol was cleaved with sodium
periodate to afford the C-15 aldehyde. Reduction of the latter with
sodium borohydride and protection of the primary alcohol with the
TBDPS group gave compound 9 in a 50% yield (over four
steps). Finally, the reductive removal of the benzoate with lithium
aluminum hydride and the cleavage of the resultant diol afforded aldehyde 10, which was used in the next Grignard reaction without further
purification. Reaction of aldehyde 10 with the Grignard
reagent 11, prepared from the commercially available
TBS-protected 3-bromo-propan-1-ol 7, afforded alcohol 12 as a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers in a 72% yield (over
three steps). Transformation of alcohol 11 into the corresponding
benzyl ether under usual conditions [NaH, BnBr, and tetrabutylammonium
iodide (TBAI) (catalytic amount), 91% yield] completed the preparation
of the fully protected triol 5. Then, installation of
the N-methylacetamide function was accomplished in
three steps (Scheme 3). Removal of the TBS group with AcOH/tetrahydrofuran(THF)/H2O (3:1:1) followed by tosylation and treatment of tosylate
with excess NH2CH3 (40% soln in water)20 afforded the secondary amine 13. Acetylation of the latter with AcCl/triethylamine (TEA) gave the
desired N-methylacetamide 14 in a 65%
overall yield (over four steps), as an approximately 1:1 mixture of
rotamers.

Fragment 5
Scheme 3 Installation of the N-Methylacetamide Function
Ketone 15 (Scheme 3) required for the
Wittig olefination was obtained
through the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether function of 14, followed by oxidation of the delivered alcohol with the catalytic
system tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) (5 mol %)/NMO, under
Ley’s conditions21 (79% over two
steps).

Initially, the Wittig process was tested using the model
compound 16 (Scheme 4) obtained from alcohol 12 through TPAP/NMO
catalytic
oxidation (90%).21 The required phosphonium
salt, (chloromethyl)triphenylphosphonium iodide 17 (Scheme 4), was prepared by
the reaction of iodochloromethane with triphenylphosphine.14a According to the literature, the Wittig reaction
was conducted in the presence of nBuLi in THF at
−78 °C.14c,14d However, although the mass recovery
was satisfying, these conditions led to a large amount of the methylenation
product 19 besides the expected chlorovinyl compound 18 (1:1 mixture of geometric isomers; 18/19 1:1, Scheme 4). A similar result was obtained when using the synthetic intermediate 15. Pleasingly, the use of potassium tert-butoxide14a as the base smoothly led
to the desired product both with the model ketone 16 (18, 76%) and with compound 15. In the latter
case, a 3:2 mixture of the two diastereomers 20 and 21, in favor of the desired Z isomer, was
obtained with an 83% yield (Scheme 4). The two isomers could be easily separated using
column chromatography, and Rotating-frame Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy
(ROESY) data allowed us to assign the double bond configuration in
each isomer.

Scheme 4 Chloromethylenation of Model Compound 16 and Synthetic
Intermediate 15
As planned, to increase the yield of the synthetically
useful isomer 20, photochemical isomerization of the E isomer 21 was addressed. According to the
literature,14d irradiation of 21 with λ
> 300 nm light (Scheme 4), in the presence of a catalytic amount of benzophenone,
induced
its conversion to the Z isomer 20 in
a 20% yield. Although low-yielding, this process (unoptimized) was
very clean, leading to only isomer 20 and unreacted 21, thus allowing recycling of this late synthetic material.
Finally, the installation of the α,β-unsaturated acid
moiety was addressed (Scheme 5). Removal of the TBDPS group in 20 with tetrabutylammonium
fluoride (TBAF)/THF followed by oxidation of the alcohol 22 with the TPAP (5 mol %)/NMO system gave aldehyde 23, which was subjected to the subsequent E-selective
Wittig olefination without further purification. Thus, the reaction
of 23 with Ph3P=CH(Me)CO2Et afforded α,β-unsaturated ester 24, which
was hydrolyzed to acid 3 on treatment with lithium hydroxide
hydrate. Overall, compound 3 was obtained with a 53%
yield over four steps.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Acid Moiety 3
Pyrrolinone moiety 4 was synthesized in a 57% overall
yield according to the previously developed racemization-free route
shown in Scheme 6.19 Briefly, the reaction of (S)-Boc-phenylalanine with Meldrum’s acid, followed by the reflux
of the crude in AcOEt for 30 min gave the Boc-protected tetramic acid 25. Methylation of the latter under Mitsunobu conditions and
the removal of the Boc protecting group gave the desired compound 4. The optical rotation measured for this material well matched
the reported value ([α]D = −62.3; lit. −63),22 indicating its high enantiopurity.

Scheme 6 Synthesis
of (S)-Pyrrolinone Moiety 4
Finally, the two building blocks 3 and 4 were coupled by using the Andrus protocol23 (Scheme 7). Thus,
the acid moiety 3 was activated as the pentafluorophenyl
ester 26 by reaction with C6F5OH/N, N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)
(82%). Coupling of 26 with an excess of lithium imidate
derived from pyrrolinone 4 proceeded smoothly, giving
the coupling product 27 in a 91% yield. Overall, compound 27 was obtained in a 2.5% yield with a longest linear sequence
(LLS) of 23 steps.

Unfortunately, the proton spectrum of the
synthetic smenamide A
did not match that of the natural smenamide A (see Supporting Information). In particular, inter alia, the H-15
signals (for the two rotamers) adjacent to the C-16 stereogenic center
had noticeably different shapes (see Supporting Information). This implied that compound 27 was
16-epi-smenamide A and, consequently, that the natural
smenamide A possessed the R configuration at C16.
At this point, to confirm the structure of smenamide A, the synthesis
of ent-smenamide A was carried out by coupling (R)-pyrrolinone 28(24) with pentafluorophenyl ester 26 (Scheme 8). Starting from (R)-Boc-phenylalanine,
compound 28 was obtained in a straightforward manner
in a 47% overall yield. Finally, the coupling of compounds 26 and 28 using the Andrus method proceeded smoothly in
this case too to give ent-smenamide A 29 in an 88% yield. The proton spectrum of this material perfectly
matched that of natural smenamide A, confirming that the configuration
at C-16 in smenamide A was indeed R. In addition,
as expected, natural smenamide A and ent-smenamide
A had mirror-image CD spectra. Compound 29 was obtained
in a 2.6% overall yield (LLS = 23 steps).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the syntheses of ent-smenamide
A and 16-epi-smenamide A have been accomplished with
a 2.6 and 2.5% overall yield, respectively, in 23 steps. The synthesis
of natural smenamide A and its analogues, according to the developed
synthetic protocol, and the evaluation of the antitumor activity of
the synthesized substances are currently under way.

General Experimental Methods
All reagents and anhydrous
solvents were purchased (Aldrich and Fluka) at the highest commercial
quality and used without further purification. β-citronellene
was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (ee ≥ 98.5%). Where necessary,
flame-dried and argon-charged glassware was used. The reactions were
monitored using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) carried out on precoated
silica gel plates (Merck 60, F254, 0.25 mm thick). Merck silica gel
(Kieselgel 40, particle size 0.063–0.200 mm) was used for the
column chromatography. MgSO4 was used as a drying agent
for aqueous workup. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were
performed using Varian Unity Inova spectrometers at 400, 500, and
700 MHz in CDCl3. Proton chemical shifts were referenced
to the residual CHCl3 signal (7.26 ppm). 13C
NMR chemical shifts were referenced to the solvent (77.0 ppm). Abbreviations
for signal coupling are as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t =
triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, and b = broad. Infrared spectra
were recorded under neat conditions on a PerkinElmer spectrum 100R
spectrophotometer and are reported in cm–1. Optical
rotations were measured using a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter at the sodium
D line. ECD spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-710 spectropolarimeter.
HRMS spectra were recorded by infusion on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL
mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source in the positive
mode using MeOH as the solvent.

Benzoate 8
According to a literature procedure,25 β-citronellene (10 mL, 7.6 g, 54.9 mmol)
was converted into
the corresponding 6,7-epoxide (8.44 g, 100%), a smelling colorless
oil. To a flask containing the crude epoxide in 1,4-dioxane/H2O (34 mL, 2:1), concentrated H2SO4 (3
drops) was added. After 1 h, solid NaHCO3 was added portion-wise
until the effervescence ceased. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo
and partitioned between water and EtOAc (3 × 20 mL). The organic
phase was dried and evaporated in vacuo to give diol 30 (8.22 g, 87%) as a colorless oil. An analytically pure sample of
this compound was obtained using chromatography over silica gel (hexane/EtOAc,

and the mixture was stirred for 15 min in a water bath and then dried.
The residue was taken up in CHCl3 (50 mL) and washed with
a saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution and water. The organic

Phosphonium Salt 17
(Chloromethyl)triphenylphosphonium iodide 17 was prepared
through a modification of the reported procedure,14a starting from triphenylphosphine (31.44 g, 120 mmol) and
chloroiodomethane (25 g, 10.3 mL, 142 mmol). In particular, the Widmer
condenser was replaced by a double-jacketed condenser. After 4 h,
the process was stopped by filtering the reaction mixture under argon
to give compound 17 (14.23 g, 27%) as a light yellow
powder. This compound could be stored in a desiccator without decomposition
for several months. Crystallization from ethanol gave 12.55 g (24%)

To a stirred solution of pyrrolinone 25 (1.0 g, 3.46
mmol) and triphenylphospine (1.36 g, 5.19 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 mL), CH3OH (0.21 mL, 5.19 mmol) and diisopropyl
azodicarboxylate (DIAD) (1.0 mL, 5.19 mmol) were added at 0 °C
under argon. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to RT, and after
6 h, it was concentrated in vacuo. Purification using column chromatography
over silica gel (hexane/EtOAc, 6:4) gave Boc-protected pyrrolinone 38 (621 mg, 57% over three steps) as a colorless oil. [α]D20 = +203.3 (c = 1.0, CH3OH); IR (neat) νmax: 2980, 2940, 1779, 1733, 1705, 1634, 1456, 1319, 1246, 1152, 1094,
