The
effect of the chain length of the alkyl and alkoxy substituents
on the binding characteristics of 1-alkyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium cations
was studied using 4-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX4) and 4-sulfonatocalix[6]arene
(SCX6) in neutral aqueous solutions at 298 K. Isothermal calorimetric
titrations showed enthalpy-controlled inclusion with 1:1 stoichiometry.
The equilibrium constants of complexation were always larger for the
confinement in SCX4 than in its SCX6 homologue because the better
matching between the host and guest sizes allowed more exothermic
interaction. The binding affinity diminished with the lengthening
of the aliphatic chain of the guests in the case of the association
with SCX4, but insignificant change was found for SCX6 complexes.
The most substantial change in the enthalpic and entropic contributions
to the driving force of complex production occurred when the alkyl
chain was linked to the heterocyclic nitrogen and the number of its
carbon atoms varied between 1 and 4. 1H NMR spectra evidenced
that in SCX6, the 1-alkyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium cations could be included
within the macrocycle cavity. In the case of SCX4, the quinolinium
ring is always inside the host, but the alkyl chain is included within
SCX4 only for a short chain length (n up to 4). In
contrast, the alkoxy chain displays a very weak interaction with the
cavity irrespective of the length. Because of the outward orientation
from the host, the lengthening of the alkoxy substituent of the quinolinium
moiety barely influenced the thermodynamics of inclusion in SCX4.
Distinct linear enthalpy–entropy correlations were found for
the encapsulation in SCX4 and SCX6.

1 Introduction
The
biocompatible, highly water-soluble 4-sulfonatocalix[n]arene (SCXn) macrocycles represent a
particularly important and intensely studied family of cavitands because
of their capability to produce various supramolecular architectures,1−3 fluorescent sensing systems,4−6 and host–guest complexes.7,8 Their π-electron-rich, flexible cavity confines various biologically
important compounds,9−11 drugs,12−14 and photochromic substances,15 thereby enhancing the solubility and stability
of the guests. The binding between surfactants and SCXn can induce association into nanoparticles,16 vesicles,17,18 or supramolecular micelles.19,20 Such self-assemblies have great potential in the design of stimuli-responsive
aggregates and drug delivery vehicles.21,22

6-Methoxyquinolinium
derivatives are important fluorophores because
they can be used in aqueous solution in a wide pH range and emit substantially
Stokes-shifted strong fluorescence. Members of this class of compounds
were applied as probes for the detection of the intracellular Cl– levels23−25 and the monitoring of Cl– transport
across cell membranes.26,27 The photophysical behavior and
inclusion complex formation of 6-methoxy-1-methylquinolinium (C1C1OQ+) were investigated,28 and the substantial change of its fluorescence
was used to detect the embedment of a herbicide in 4-sulfonatocalix[4]arene
(SCX4).29

For the rational design
of tailor-made self-assembled systems incorporating
SCXn hosts, the deeper understanding of the relationship
between the molecular structure of the components and the driving
force of encapsulation is of crucial importance. In the present study,
we reveal how the systematic variation of the length and the location
of the alkyl chain in quinolinium derivatives influence the thermodynamics
of binding and the structure of the produced inclusion complex. We
focus on two types of guests, 1-methyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium (C1CnOQ+, n = 1, 2, 4, 6) and 1-alkyl-6-methoxy-quinolinium (CnC1OQ+, n = 1, 2, 4,
6, 8) cations, and the number of sulfonatophenol units in the SCXn cavitands is varied from n = 4 to 6.
We intend to deal only with 1:1 inclusion complexes. Therefore, the
larger SCX8 homologue, producing associates of various stoichiometries,
were not encompassed in the present work. On the basis of the reported
deprotonation constants,30 we infer that
one phenolic OH of SCX4 dissociated, whereas two phenolic OH substituents
lost protons in 4-sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SCX6) at neutral pH. Therefore,
SCX4 and SCX6 had 5 and 8 negative charges under our experimental
conditions, respectively. The formulas of the employed compounds are
presented in Scheme 1.

2.1 Thermodynamics of Inclusion
in SCXn
To get insight into the driving
force of the
confinement of 1-alkyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium (CnCmOQ+) in SCX4 or SCX6
cavitands, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were
performed. Figure 1 shows representative results corresponding to the titration of SCX4
by C8C1OQ+ and the determination
of the dilution enthalpy of the titrant. The released heat decreased
upon successive additions of the ligand until the value of the dilution
heat was reached because of the gradual reduction of the amount of
the free binding sites. The inflexion point appeared at the equimolar
component concentration, indicating the 1:1 stoichiometry of the resulting
complex. The nonlinear least-squares fit of the enthalpograms provided
the binding constant (K) and the enthalpy change
upon encapsulation (ΔH). The standard free
enthalpy (ΔG) and entropy changes (ΔS) were deduced on the basis of the following equation 1  where R is the gas constant
and T stands for the temperature.

Figure 1 Variation of the integrated
heat evolved per injection during the
titration of 0.1 mM SCX4 solution by 2 mM C8C1OQ+ solution (■). The line represents the fit with
a 1:1 complexation model, whereas (□) displays the heat released
per injection of the titrant into water.

Similar experiments were carried out with various CnCmOQ+–SCXn pairs, and the results are summarized in Table 1. All quinolinium derivatives
display larger binding affinity to SCX4 than to SCX6 because the tighter
fit into the smaller and more rigid homologue results in more exothermic
(6–7 kJ mol–1 difference) host–guest
interactions. The better match of the size of the guests with the
cavity of SCX4 ensures the more efficient limitation of the degrees
of freedom of the components resulting in more substantial entropy
diminution (2–4 kJ mol–1TΔS difference) for the encapsulation in SCX4.

Figure 2 depicts
the correlations between the binding constants and the number of carbon
atoms in the aliphatic chain of the guest molecules. Decreasing trends
were observed when SCX4 served as a host, and the extent of this variation
was more pronounced for the CnC1OQ+ class of compounds than for the C1CnOQ+ family. In contrast, the K values of SCX6 complexes were practically independent
of the length of the alkyl group because the entropy contribution
counterbalanced the ΔH variation in the series
of compounds (Table 1). The binding constants of the CnCmOQ+ embedment in SCX4 were significantly
larger than the corresponding values reported for 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium31 (Cnmim+) and alkylammonium32 (CnNH3+) guests. For these guests, the increase
of the hydrophobicity and aromatic character follows this order: CnNH3+ < Cnmim+ < CnCmOQ+. In particular, the
quinolinium derivatives participate in the strongest hydrophobic host–guest
interactions and additionally, are able to interact via π–π
binding between the aromatic ring of the guest and the π-electron-rich
core of SCX4. These two interactions will both contribute to the ΔH diminution. Indeed, the removal of a weaker-bound hydration
shell from the cationic moiety in the course of host–guest
complexation requires less desolvation energy for CnCmOQ+. The more substantial
binding affinity of CnCmOQ+ cations to SCX4 compared with that of Cnmim+ and CnNH3+ arises from the larger enthalpy
gain. For example, the ΔH values of SCX4 complex
formation at 298 K are −17.9, −33.9, and −37.9
kJ mol–1 for C4NH3+, C4mim+, and C1C4OQ+, respectively, whereas the ΔS values
of these processes are 16.6, −19.0 and −19.5 J mol–1 K–1, respectively.31,32 In the case of the confinement in SCX6, CnCmOQ+ cations had about
1 order of magnitude larger binding constant than Cnmim+ guests31 because
of the less negative ΔS for the encapsulation
of the former class of compounds.

or C1CnOQ+ (triangles)
with SCX4 (empty
symbols) and SCX6 (filled symbols) as a function of the number of
carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain of the guests at pH 7 and 298
K.

The enthalpy-driven exothermic
formation of all CnCmOQ+ complexes were
accompanied by unfavorable entropy change, implying that the release
of water from the hydrate shell of the constituents upon association
does not counterbalance the loss of entropy due to the inclusion of
the guest in the host cavity. The variation of the enthalpy and entropy
terms with the alkyl substituent significantly differed for CnC1OQ+–SCX4 and
C1CnOQ+–SCX4
(Figure S1). In the case of the former
complexes, the gradual lengthening of the carbon chain from methyl
to butyl led to ΔH and TΔS reduction, but the change levelled off upon further extension
of the aliphatic group. In contrast, ΔH and TΔS were practically independent
of the molecular structure of C1CnOQ+–SCX4, but both quantities increased with
the alkyl length for the encapsulation of C1CnOQ+ in SCX6. The thermodynamic parameters
of CnC1OQ+ embedment
in SCX4 followed a similar trend to that found for the inclusion in
SCX6. The latter cavitand may adopt inverted double partial cone conformation.33 The manner of CnC1OQ+ inclusion in the partial cone of SCX6
probably resembles the location in SCX4.

We found two distinct
linear correlations when the entropy variation
of the SCX4 and SCX6 complexes of quinolinium derivatives (TΔS) was plotted as a function of
the binding enthalpy (ΔH) (Figure 3). The experimental data were
fitted by the following relationship34 2  where the slope (α) indicates the extent
to which the enthalpy change is counterbalanced by the concomitant
entropy loss upon complex formation.

Figure 3 Enthalpy–entropy correlation for
the 1:1 inclusion of CnC1OQ+ (blue square)
or C1CnOQ+ (red
triangle) in SCX4 or SCX6 in neutral aqueous solution at 298 K.

Enthalpy–entropy compensation
has been observed for host–guest
binding35−38 because the exothermicity of association usually restricts the movement
of the constituents, thereby causing growing entropy loss. In the
case of the confinement in SCX4, α = 1.21 and TΔS0 = 40.0 kJ mol–1 were calculated, whereas α = 1.06 and TΔS0 = 30.4 kJ mol–1 were derived
from the thermodynamic data of SCX6 complexes. The larger slope (α)
and intercept (TΔS0) of the linear ΔH versus TΔS relationship for the confinement in the
smaller SCX4 cavitand is due to the tighter binding and the release
of more water molecules from the solvation shell of the reactants
than in the case of the association with SCX6. The parameters found
for CnCmOQ+–SCX4 complexes in the present study resemble those
reported for the embedment of Cnmim+ cations in SCX4 (α = 1.38 and TΔS0 = 40.3 kJ mol–1).31 In the case of SCX6 host, α and TΔS0 for the inclusion
of CnCmOQ+ guests were larger than those found for Cnmim+ (α = 0.80 and TΔS0 = 16.6 kJ mol–1),31 and approached the values previously
found for 1:1 Cnmim+–SCX8
associates (α = 0.96 and TΔS0 = 27.9 kJ mol–1).39 The much larger TΔS0 of CnCmOQ+–SCX6 complexes relative to that of Cnmim+–SCX6 implies that
more water molecules are expelled from the host interior upon the
entry of the bulkier, more hydrophobic quinolinium headgroup. The
looser binding of the smaller methylimidazolium moiety causes less
extensive desolvation and as a consequence, smaller entropy gain contribution.
The close to unity α of CnCmOQ+–SCX6 complexes indicates
that the change of ΔH, arising from the variation
of the substitution pattern of the guest, is almost completely offset
by the accompanying entropy modification. When the smaller, more hydrophilic
headgroup of Cnmim+ is encapsulated
in SCX6, fewer degrees of freedom are limited and less water is released
from the hydrate shell of the constituents into the bulk solution.
As a consequence, ΔS changes in a smaller extent
in the series of Cnmim+–SCX6
complexes than upon the inclusion of CnCmOQ+ in SCX6.

2.2 Molecular Structure of the SCXn Complexes
To gain insight into the structure of the inclusion
complexes, 1H NMR experiments were performed. As a representative
example, Figure 4 displays
the spectra of C4C1OQ+–SCX4
and C1C4OQ+–SCX4. The broadening
observed for the peaks related to the SCX4 protons results from conformational
changes of the macrocycle that could correspond to inversions of the
aromatic rings40 and/or distortions of
the cone conformation.41 These dynamical
processes stand in the intermediate regime, as can be seen in Figure 4. In contrast, the
same spectra suggest that both quinolinium derivatives undergo a fast
exchange between the free and the complexed states over the characteristic
NMR time scale. When the SCX4/quinolinium molar ratio is set to 2:1
and the total concentration of 10 mM is used, more than 95% of the
quinolinium derivatives is complexed to SCX4 on the basis of the K value (Table 1). Therefore, the 1H chemical shifts measured under
such conditions allow the probing of the quinolinium location within
both C4C1OQ+–SCX4 and C1C4OQ+–SCX4 complexes. In the
case of the former complex, the resonances related to the quinolinium
and the butyl protons shift upfield in comparison to the signals of
the free C4C1OQ+ molecules. Figure 5A and Table S1 show that the most significant encapsulation-induced
chemical shift variations (Δδ) are observed for the peaks
assigned to H2, H3, and H4 for all studied guests. This indicates
that the corresponding part of the quinolinium has the deepest immersion
within the SCX4 cavity. Among the aromatic proton resonances, the
H7 signal undergoes the weakest upfield shift, implying that this
terminal of the quinolinium is oriented toward the aqueous phase.
The Δδ value determined for the methoxy protons is the
smallest in CnC1OQ+–SCX4 complexes, indicating that the methoxy substituent is
located far from the core of the macrocycle.

10 mM C1C4OQ+, and 3.3 mM C1C4OQ+ + 6.7
mM SCX4 mixture in D2O at 298 K. The asterisks denote the
peaks related to the SCX4 protons; (A,B) correspond to two distinct
spectral ranges. The small triplet at 1.05 ppm results from an impurity
present in the SCX4 compound. (The spectrum of neat SCX4 solution
displays this small contribution.)

CnC1OQ+–SCX4:
NCH2 (■), H4 (●), CH3 (○),
OCH3 (△) and (B) C1CnOQ+–SCX4: NCH3 (■), H4
(●), CH3 (○), OCH2 (△).
Both complexes are obtained using 1:2 quinolinium/SCX4 molar ratio
and a total concentration of 10 mM.

Among the alkyl protons of CnC1OQ+, the increase of the alkyl chain length
resulted
in the largest chemical shift variation for the −CH3 protons. As shown in Figure 5A, the Δδ value of this signal is reduced upon
the gradual increase of the number of aliphatic carbon atoms from
methyl to hexyl, while the change tends to level off for CnC1OQ+–SCX4 with n ≥ 6. Such a behavior suggests that the short alkyl
chains (n = 1, 2, and 4) were included in SCX4. Hexyl
and octyl substituents are too long to be fully embedded in SCX4.
Therefore, their end is located outside the cavity, exhibiting vanishing
interactions with the host. This is in accord with the results of
the calorimetric experiments (Table 1), which demonstrated that the exothermicity of inclusion
in SCX4 initially grew upon the gradual increase of the number of
aliphatic carbon atoms in the substituent linked to the heterocyclic
nitrogen and then levelled off. The incorporation of the short alkyl
chains (n < 6) within the macrocycle may rationalize
the line broadening observed for their 1H NMR peaks in
the spectrum of CnC1OQ+–SCX4, as exemplified for n = 4 in Figure 4B. The confinement
of the aliphatic chains should indeed induce a restriction in their
reorientational motions and then, a reduction of their T2(1H) relaxation times compared to free CnC1OQ+.

As the
number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain is raised from n = 1 to 4, the Δδ values for the aromatic protons
vary. In particular, a continuous increase is observed for H2 and
H8 (and also NCH2), whereas the opposite trend is observed
for H3 and H4. These simultaneous variations suggest an alteration
of the orientation of the quinolinium ring within the SCX4 cavity
resulting from the increase of the volume occupied by the alkyl chain.

In the case of the C1CnOQ+–SCX4 complexes, the chemical shift of the 1H NMR peaks related to the alkoxy moiety is nearly unchanged with
respect to the value observed for the solution of the corresponding
uncomplexed quinolinium (Figure 5B and Table S2). Figure 4 shows that the chemical
shift of each proton of the quinolinium ring of C1CnOQ+ still displays a significant
change upon the addition of SCX4. In particular, the peaks attributed
to H2, H3, H4, and N–CH3 protons undergo the most
significant upfield shift, implying that the quinolinium ring of C1CnOQ+ is inside the
SCX4 cavity, whereas the alkoxy chain protrudes from it. The line
width of the 1H NMR peaks assigned to the alkoxy group
of C1CnOQ+–SCX4
is similar to the one observed in the spectrum of free C1CnOQ+ (Figure 4B). In contrast to CnC1OQ+–SCX4 (n < 6), the aliphatic chain is not confined within the macrocycle
and as a result, no significant line broadening is found.

The
Δδ values for the protons of the quinolinium moiety
of C1CnOQ+ and CnC1OQ+ differ for n ≥ 2 (Figure 5), suggesting distinct orientations of the heterocyclic ring
within SCX4. Another main difference between the C1CnOQ+–SCX4 and the CnC1OQ+–SCX4 complexes
concerns the position of the alkoxy and alkyl chains. In the case
of the CnC1OQ+–SCX4
complexes, the alkyl chains may be included within the SCX4 host for
low n values (n < 6). As n is raised further, the alkyl chain end extends out of
the cavity. This could result from a contribution of steric hindrance.
In contrast, for the C1CnOQ+–SCX4 complexes, the shortest alkoxy group (n = 1) is already far from the interior of the host. Therefore,
the increase of this chain length does not cause any Δδ
change (Figure 5B)
and the orientation of the quinolinium ring of C1CnOQ+–SCX4 remains unaltered.
The outward orientation from the host cavity rationalizes that the
lengthening of the alkoxy substituent brings about minor change in
ΔH and ΔS of C1CnOQ+–SCX4 complex
formation (Table 1).

Because of the lower binding affinity to SCX6, 1H NMR
spectra were recorded for a 1:3 quinolinium/SCX6 molar ratio to ensure
that more than 95% of the guest was confined to the host. The variations
of the proton chemical shifts (Δδ) upon complexation of
C1C1OQ+ with SCX6 and SCX4 are compared
in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. The upfield shift of all 1H NMR peaks upon confinement
in SCX6 indicates that the entire C1C1OQ+ cation is included in the spacious cavity of the host. In
the case of the C1C1OQ+–SCX6
complex, the upfield shift related to the H2, H3, and H4 signals were
significantly smaller because of the looser binding. For the other
aromatic protons of the guest, the upfield shift was found to be higher
than that of the corresponding peaks in the spectrum of C1C1OQ+–SCX4. In the larger SCX6 macrocycle,
various orientations of the guest could be allowed, leading to an
additional averaging of the corresponding 1H chemical shifts.

When a methyl substituent of C1C1OQ+ was replaced by a butyl group, the chemical shift changes induced
by the incorporation into SCX6 remained similar to those of C1C1OQ+–SCX6 and did not depend
significantly on the location of the butyl moiety (Table S4, Supporting Information). All butyl proton signals
of C4C1OQ+ and C1C4OQ+ shifted upfield, indicating that the whole
butyl chain interacts with SCX6. The larger and more flexible SCX6
macrocycle adapts better to the geometrical features of the guests
than SCX4. The guest binding induced calixarene conformation change,
the so-called “template effect” which has also been
noticed for other associates,40,42,43 may explain the slightly larger alteration of ΔH and ΔS with the substituent in the series
of C1CnOQ+–SCX6
complexes (Table 1).

3 Conclusions
The confinement of CnCmOQ+ in SCXn cavitands
significantly depends not only on the location and the length of the
hydrocarbon chain of the guest but also on the size of the macrocycle.
Both the thermodynamic parameters of the embedment in SCXn and the structure of the resulting CnCmOQ+–SCXn complexes can be tuned by the variation of the number of aliphatic
carbon atoms attached to the nitrogen of the quinolinium moiety, but
alteration of the alkoxy chain length causes a minor effect. 1H NMR experiments demonstrated that in the case of SCX4, the
short alkyl chains (n ≤ 4) may be incorporated,
together with the quinolinium ring, within the host cavity, while
a part of longer alkyl chains are located out of the cavity. In contrast,
even the short alkoxy groups were found to display very weak interactions
with SCX4, while the quinolinium ring is still found within the cavity.
The larger SCX6 macrocycle allows an easier inclusion of both kinds
of quinolinium (CnC1OQ+ and C1CmOQ+), with an incorporation of either the alkyl or the alkoxy chains
within the cavity when n or m ≤
4. From a thermodynamic point of view, the tighter binding in the
smaller, more rigid SCX4 brings about larger enthalpy gain accompanied
by more substantial entropy diminution, which lead to considerably
larger equilibrium constant than the association with SCX6. The stability
of the CnCmOQ+–SCX6 complexes cannot be modified by the alteration
of the alkyl substituent of the guest because the enthalpy variation
is compensated by the concomitant entropy change. The knowledge on
the relationship between the molecular structure of constituents and
the thermodynamics of host–guest binding gained in the present
study may be applied in the design of tailor-made supramolecular systems
and self-assembled architectures.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
SCX4 and SCX6 were purchased
from Acros Organics and used after drying under vacuum at 343 K overnight.
Double-distilled water was used as a solvent, and SCXn (n = 4 or 6) solutions were neutralized by the
minimum volume of concentrated NaOH. The various 1-alkyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium
salts were synthesized and characterized as described in the Supporting Information. C1CnOQ+ and C4C1OQ+ had I– counterions, whereas C2C1OQ+, C6C1OQ+, and C8C1OQ+ were used as Br– salts.

4.2 Sample Preparation
Stock solutions
of 1-alkyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium salts (2 mM) and SCXn (0.1 mM, adjusted to pH 7 by NaOH addition) were prepared for ITC
experiments. NMR experiments were performed by mixing appropriate
amounts of 1-alkyl-6-alkoxy-quinolinium (6 or 10 mM) and SCXn (6 or 10 mM, neutralized by NaOD) solutions in D2O. All the experiments were carried out at pH 7.

4.3 Instrumentation
1H NMR
spectra were recorded in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide or in D2O on a Bruker Avance II 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. ITC measurements
were carried out with a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Quinolinium
solutions were injected from the computer-controlled microsyringe
at an interval of 180 s into the cell (volume = 1.4569 mL) containing
0.1 mM SCXn solution at pH 7, while stirring at 450
rpm.
