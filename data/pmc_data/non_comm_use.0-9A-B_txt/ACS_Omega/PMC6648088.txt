Herein,
we examine the photochemical formation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) by a porous benzophenone-containing bis-urea host (1) to investigate the mechanism of photooxidations that occur within
the confines of its nanochannels. UV irradiation of the self-assembled
host in the presence of molecular oxygen generates both singlet oxygen
and superoxide when suspended in solution. The efficiency of ROS generation
by the host is lower than that of benzophenone (BP), which could be
beneficial for reactions carried out catalytically, as ROS species
react quickly and often unselectively. Superoxide formation was detected
through reaction with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide
in the presence of methanol. However, it is not detected in CHCl3, as it reacts rapidly with the solvent to generate methaneperoxy
and chloride anions, similar to BP. The lifetime of airborne singlet
oxygen (τΔairborne) was examined at the air–solid
outer surface of the host and host·quencher complexes and suggests
that quenching is a surface phenomenon. The efficiency of the host
and BP as catalysts was compared for the photooxidation of 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene
in solution. Both the host and BP mediate the photooxidation in CHCl3, benzene, and benzene-d6, producing
primarily epoxide-derived products with low selectivity likely by
both type I and type II photooxidation processes. Interestingly, in
CHCl3, two chlorohydrins were also formed, reflecting the
formation of chloride in this solvent. In contrast, UV irradiation
of the host·guest crystals in an oxygen atmosphere produced no
epoxide and appeared to favor mainly the type II processes. Photolysis
afforded high conversion to only three products: an enone, a tertiary
allylic alcohol, and a diol, which demonstrates the accessibility
of the encapsulated reactants to oxygen and the influence of confinement
on the reaction pathway.

Introduction
Here, we investigate
the selectivity and efficiency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) photogeneration
by a self-assembled benzophenone bis-urea macrocycle
(host 1) and probe its utility for mediating the photooxidation
of 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene (2) suspended in solution compared
to the solid state. Host 1 presents two benzophenone
(BP) photosensitizer units covalently attached to two urea groups
through methylene bridges resulting in a bis-urea
macrocycle. Self-assembly through bifurcated urea hydrogen-bonding
interactions affords hexagonally packed columnar nanotubes that are
activated by heating to generate accessible channels that can be readily
loaded with guests and applied as a nanoreactor for selective photooxidations, Figure 1.1,2

Figure 1 Macrocycle 1 is composed of two BP sensitizer units covalently bound
through methylene urea groups. Self-assembly through bifurcated urea
hydrogen-bonding interactions results in the formation of porous host 1 nanotubes with one-dimensional (1D) elliptical channels
(highlighted in light blue). UV irradiation of the host crystals results
in the generation of ROS through type I and type II pathways.

Our previous report showed that
photolysis of host 1 crystals in oxygenated CHCl3 showed NIR photoluminescence of 1O2 at 1270 nm.1 Furthermore, UV irradiation
(1 h) of the crystals generates low quantities (∼1 in 30 000
molecules) of persistent triplet radical pairs consisting of a ketyl
radical and benzylic radicals.3 In the
current work, we hypothesize that host 1 will photogenerate
ROS in a controlled manner based on media (suspended in solution versus
in the solid state). Our work is fundamental, in that controlling
the type of ROS formed is challenging.

ROS can be employed in
a diverse range of applications ranging from wastewater treatment
to photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment4−7 but are often produced as mixtures.
This is because O2 can be activated through type I and
type II photosensitized oxidation processes.8,9 Type
I reactions produce species such as O2•–, HO2·, ROO·, RO·, and ·OH.9−11 Type II reactions
mainly produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through
a Dexter energy transfer of the triplet sensitizer with 3O2.8,12−14 Achieving high
selectivity in photooxidations carried out by ROS is challenging due
to their high reactivity. Thus, strategies to achieve control over
selectivity are useful and include templating,15 air–water interfacial effects,16 and nanocavity confinement.1,17,18

Herein, we probe the channel confinement effect
with host 1 in an effort to gain some control over the
ROS mechanism. In this work, we found that photolysis of host 1 leads to (1) the detection of both O2•– and 1O2, which was found to be dependent on
its environment; (2) an 1O2 quantum yield (Φ[1O2]) of 1–12%; (3) outer wall quenching
of 1O2 by host 1, reducing the
lifetime of 1O2 at the air–solid interface;
and (4) some selectivity in photooxidations of 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene 2 in solution (type I and type II reactions) versus within
the solid phase (favoring type II reactions). Selectivity comparisons
of host 1 are made with homogeneous photooxidations with
benzophenone19 and selectivity achieved
with octa acid hosts20 and zeolites.21

Our data are consistent with the mechanism
shown in Scheme 1,
in which host 1 photogenerates both 1O2 and O2•–.10,22 Selectivity for hydroperoxide 5 over 3 and 4 is seen in the solid state, where 5 undergoes a Schenk rearrangement to enone 10. Superoxide
generation by BP involves the formation of a ketyl radical, which
will then undergo an electron-transfer process with 3O2 to form O2•–.10,22,23 A π host/O2 exciplex
or σ R2C(O•)O2• biradical at a BP site is proposed as the epoxidizing agent due
to the unusual formation of chlorohydrins in CHCl3.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Photooxidation Pathways of Host 1
Results and Discussion
ROS Generated
by the Host 1 Crystals Suspended in Solution
The type of
ROS generated by host 1 suspended in solution was investigated
using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopies.
Literature examples show that BP photoactivates oxygen to O2•– in protic solvents, such as MeOH, ethanol,
and 2-propanol.10,22 Therefore, EPR spin-trapping
experiments were used to probe if host 1, like parent
BP, generates O2•–. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was selected as the spin trap, which is known
to form adducts (doublet of triplets) with O2•–, hydroxide, or peroxyl radicals, where DMPO–OOH degrades
to DMPO–OH adduct.24−26 Interestingly, the detection
of O2•– by EPR was found to be
solvent-dependent using DMPO, where the DMPO–OOH adduct was
detected in a solution of benzene containing catalytic amounts MeOH
but was not detected in CHCl3 (Figure 2).

Figure 2 EPR studies of host 1 suspended
in oxygen-saturated solutions of O2•– and 1O2 quenchers. (A) DMPO was used to trap
O2•– in benzene in the presence
of 1 and MeOH. (B) DMPO O2•–-trapping experiment in CHCl3 in the presence of 1. (C) Irradiation of 1 in a solution of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
(TMP) in CHCl3 results in the chemical quenching of 1O2 to form 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-yl
oxidanyl (TEMPO) over time. (D) Comparison of the TMP chemical-quenching
studies with three photosensitizers: perinaphthenone, BP, and host 1. The error bars for the host 1 plot represent
the standard deviation between triplicate trials.

Irradiation of a host 1 suspension of DMPO in
benzene with a catalytic amount of MeOH resulted in the formation
of a DMPO adduct evident (Figure 2A) by hyperfine splitting constants of aN = 14.2 G and aH = 9.2 G,
which is in the range of typical DMPO–OOH adducts (Figure S8).27−29 Furthermore, the irradiation
of BP for 2 min in the presence of DMPO and MeOH also resulted in
the formation of a four-line spectrum that overlays well with the
spectra obtained by host 1, with aN = 13.8 G and aH = 9.3 G (Figure S9). In the presence of MeOH, the host
can generate O2•–, albeit ∼15×
slower than BP. The formation of superoxide is further supported by
the direct detection of its λmax at 255 nm, using
UV–visible spectroscopy in acetonitrile (Figure S25).10

A similar
experiment was carried out using chloroform as the solvent; however,
no DMPO adduct was detected, Figure 4B. The lack of DMPO adduct suggests that the [O2•–] is very low, leaving little if
any O2•– to form an adduct with
DMPO. Relatedly, Roberts and Sawyer reported that O2•– reacts with CHCl3 to generate methaneperoxy
(HC(=O)OO–) and chloride anions.30 In addition, the oxidative breakdown of CHCl3 is also known to produce HCl, HCO2H, CO, and Cl2. Therefore, it is likely that O2•– is indeed generated by 1 in CHCl3 but quickly
reacts with the solvent before any DMPO adduct can be formed. This
result suggests that the use of CHCl3 for O2•– detection by DMPO should be avoided.

Next, the formation of 1O2 was probed using
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP), which is oxidized by 1O2 to form a stable nitroxide radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl
piperidine-1-yl oxidanyl (TEMPO), which gives rise to three-line EPR
spectra.24,26 Irradiation of an oxygen-saturated CHCl3 solution with suspended host 1 led to the formation
of a three-line TEMPO signal, indicating the formation of 1O2 (Figure 2C). The areas obtained by the EPR signals for DMPO and TEMPO in CHCl3 were found to be quite similar (5.8 vs 5.1) with the O2•– adduct generated ∼1.1×
faster than 1O2. Thus, both O2•– and 1O2 are photogenerated
by host 1 in type I and type II processes.

Quantum Yields
of 1O2 Generation in Solution
The 1O2 quantum yield of 1 while suspended
in CHCl3 was approximated using EPR and UV–visible
spectroscopy and was found to be low, ranging from 1 to 12% depending
on the method. Figure 2C shows the gradual formation of TEMPO from TMP. The Φ[1O2]host 1 was estimated
to be ∼1% in CHCl3 when compared to the reference,
perinapthenone (Figure 2D).31 In some cases, the use of TMP in
determining the quantum yield of 1O2 production
can be misleading when the excited photosensitizer is able to react
with TMP, resulting in the TMP+•.26 The radical cation can then undergo a reaction with molecular
oxygen to form an EPR-detectable TEMPO signal that is not attributed
to 1O2 production.26 While this process has been observed by the parent BP, it is not
anticipated to occur (or be minimal at best) with host 1 because TMP is too large to fit into the host channels (Table S1).

In addition to EPR, the Φ[1O2] was also measured by UV–vis spectroscopy
using 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene (DMN), an 1O2 trap
that absorbs at higher-energy wavelengths (∼290 nm) than the
360 nm required for 1 to generate 1O2. Figure 3 shows the
decrease of the DMN absorbance signal with the time of irradiation,
indicative of the DMN reaction with 1O2 forming
the 1,4-naphthalene endoperoxide product, which does not absorb in
this region. From these data, we calculated the Φ[1O2]host 1 to be 12% in CHCl3, when compared to the reference methylene blue.32,33 We note that 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene-1,4-endoperoxide has a half-life
(t1/2) of 5 h at 25 °C and can serve
as a chemical source of 1O2;34−3634−36 however, this 1O2 release was relatively low
on the time scale of our quantum yield measurements. Furthermore,
it is not surprising that the Φ[1O2] varies
between the two techniques, as they show different sensitivity.37

Figure 3 Indirect quantification of the quantum yield of 1O2 generation by host 1 as monitored by the
absorption loss of DMN. (A) Oxygen-saturated solution of DMN was irradiated
in the presence of host 1 and the absorbance spectra
recorded over time to monitor the loss of DMN. (B) Area of UV absorbance
plotted versus time of UV irradiation for host 1.

Given these results, we conclude
that the host generates low quantities of 1O2 with Φ[1O2]host 1 ranging from 1 to 12%. The low 1O2 quantum
yield could be advantageous for suspended host catalytic studies,
as it may encourage oxidations to occur within the confines of the
host channels as opposed to free in solution.

Lifetime of 1O2 at the Air–Solid Interface
Because
selectivity was reported for the photooxidation of 2-methyl-2-butene
in crystalline complexes with host 1,1 we are interested in the lifetime of 1O2 at the air–solid interface of the host crystals. The
lifetime reduction of 1O2 by the 1·DMSO complex and by solid Ph3P was measured to give
a sense of the outer-wall-quenching capacity. Solid Ph3P was used for comparison, as it is a well-known chemical quencher
of 1O2 in the solution phase.13,38 Other 1·quencher complexes were prepared and include N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine, and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine (Table S1).

Figure 4 shows the lifetime of airborne 1O2 (τΔairborne) generated
by a three-phase apparatus to be ∼150 μs and thus longer
compared to 1O2 solvated in benzene and toluene
by ∼5-fold (31 and 29 μs, respectively), and MeOH and
ethanol by ∼15-fold (10 and 13 μs, respectively).39 The lifetime of 1O2 in
DMSO is 30 μs but is reduced in pyridine (5.7 μs).39 The total quenching rate constant (kT) for Ph3P is 8.5 × 106 M–1 s–1, and for other phosphines,
it ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 × 107 M–1 s–1.38,40,41 The table in Figure 4 shows that the τΔairborne is reduced going
from a sample absent of a solid-trapping agent (∼0.15 ms) to
a sample containing solid host 1 (with DMSO or pyridine
guests; 0.13 and 0.12 ms, respectively) and solid Ph3P
(0.10 ms). These data are in line with the quenching of 1O2 in the solution phase. We attribute the decrease to
be sensitive to factors such as the high oxophilicity of Ph3P in solid-surface physical and chemical quenching. That is, once
the 1O2 was carried from the sensitizer plate
to the air/solid interface of the solid host or solid Ph3P, it was quenched. In the previous work, long and short 1O2 lifetimes were found depending on whether it resided
within a gas bubble or in the bulk aqueous solution.42 In a gas bubble, an 1O2 lifetime
of 0.98 ms has been previously observed.42 Seeing that the lifetime of 1O2 in air is
decreased in the presence of the host in comparison to the Pc plate
or in a gas bubble, we wanted to next investigate ROS formation by
the interior of the host.

experimental setup, consisting of a sensitizer plate used to generate

this study.

Comparison of Photooxidations
of 1-Methyl-1-cyclohexene (2) Sensitized by Host 1 and BP
Oxidation reactions were investigated in solution (CHCl3, benzene, and benzene-d6) and in the
solid state to uncover differences in product distributions. Our goal
is to correlate the products formed to specific photooxidation mechanisms
(type I vs type II) and to uncover confinement effects. Substrate 2 and sensitizer (1 or BP) were UV-irradiated
in an oxygen-saturated environment (solution or solid state). The
reactions were quenched with triphenylphosphine to reduce any hydroperoxides
and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
(Table 1).

Efficiency
of Photooxidations in Heterogeneous Solutions
The photosensitizers
investigated vary in solubility. Host 1 was used as a
suspension, while BP was soluble. Photolysis of 2 mediated
by sensitizer 1 in oxygen-saturated CHCl3 (Table 1, entry 1) led to
three major oxidation products, epoxide 6 (21%) and two
chlorohydrins 7 (24%) and 8 (16%). Overall,
92% conversion was observed with other minor products consisting mainly
of enones and ketones (Figure S20). The
formation of the chlorohydrins reflects the degradation of the solvent
by O2•–, as indicated by the DMPO
spin-trapping experiment in CHCl3. Thus, we compared photolysis
of 2 with BP sensitizer under similar conditions (Table 1, entry 2), which
resulted in 100% conversion of 2. Chlorohydrin 7 (37%) was the major product with multiple chlorinated alkenes,
again confirming the degradation of CHCl3 under these conditions.

With both sensitizers, epoxide-derived products are observed as
well as chloride addition from the oxidative breakdown of solvent
(Scheme 1, inset).
Our hypothesis is that the epoxidizing agent is either a π BP/O2 exciplex or σ R2C(O•)O2• biradical. Benzophenone has been reported
to be an n−π* triplet sensitizer, where cycloaddition
to an alkene forms a dioxetane in addition to an allylic hydroperoxide
formation from singlet oxygen.19,43 BP is also a noted
type I photosensitizer.44−46 To avoid chloride production,
we next examined these reactions in benzene.

Photolysis of 2 mediated by sensitizer 1 for 12 h in oxygen-saturated
benzene or benzene-d6 (Table 1, entries 3 and 5) gave similar
conversions (40 vs 37%) despite a large variation of the 1O2 lifetime from 30 to 731 μs.47 Similarly, poor selectivity was seen in both cases with
the major products being alcohols 3, 5,
and epoxide 6. In comparison, the photooxidation of 2 sensitized by BP under similar conditions was also unselective
and gave the same major products 3, 5, and 6 (Table 1,
entries 4 and 6). Interestingly, in the case of BP, the 25-fold difference
in 1O2 lifetime did play a role in conversion.
Nearly, double the conversion of 2 was observed in benzene-d6 (71%) compared to that in benzene (41%). Alcohols 3 and 5 are common oxidation products observed
in type II 1O2-mediated oxidations of cycloalkene 2.17,48−50 Furthermore,
epoxide 6 could arise from either a type I or a type
II process. We also observed the formation of significant amounts
of biphenyl, which is expected to proceed via H-abstraction and coupling.
Lack of mechanistic control likely lowers the selectivity in solution.
The biradical is directed to the exterior of the assembled host and
is not expected to be influential in reactions that proceed within
its interior, for example, within the solid host·guest crystals.

Activated host 1 crystals were readily loaded with
alkene 2 to afford a host/guest complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry.
Remarkably, the photolysis of host 1·2 crystals in the solid state led to only three products in high conversion
with shorter irradiation time (Table 1, entry 7). After just 5 h at 0 °C, two unexpected
products were obtained, enone 10 (42%) and diol 9 (13%). Products 9 and 10 are not
observed in solution, demonstrating the influence encapsulation of 2 on the photooxidation pathway. Indeed, the low temperature
ensures that 2 remains in the channel during the photoreaction
(Figure S19). Products are not released
until the host is sonicated in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of
triphenylphosphine. A depiction of a potential host 1·2 complex is shown in Figure 5A. The high conversion demonstrates that
oxygen readily enters the channels under these conditions. The only
typical product observed was alcohol 5, which was produced
in 32% selectivity. Enone 10 is likely derived from 1O2 through a Schenck allylic peroxyl radical rearrangement
of 5.51,52 This rearrangement may be facilitated
by confinement as well as by long-lived resonance-stabilized surface/host
radicals, which form in low quantity (up to ∼1 in 10 000
molecules) upon irradiation of host 1 crystals, shown
schematically in Figure 5B.3

Figure 5 Depictions
of host 1 complexes. (A) Top-down view (left) and side
view (right) of the plausible host 1·2 complex. (B) Irradiation of the host 1 nanotubes results
in the formation of host-supported radicals in low quantities.3 (C) Vapor diffusion of 2 resulted
in the formation of the host 1·2 complex,
irradiation in an oxygen atmosphere results in the type II photooxidations
via the “ene” or [2 + 2] cycloaddition pathways.

Formation of diol 9 is particularly interesting and may suggest the formation of dioxetane-type
intermediates within the narrow channels, Figure 5C. We are currently utilizing computations
to investigate the stability of such intermediates within our frameworks.
This diol can also be formed upon oxidation of 2 by enzyme
P450.53,54 In contrast to the solution, no epoxide
was observed within the solid complexes. One plausible explanation
is that the required biradical would not be accessible as it is formed
on the exterior of host 1. Thus, it is not surprising
that no epoxide was observed.

In comparison to other molecular
containers, the reaction of 2 encapsulated in Gibb’s
octa acid capsule (2:2) with the sensitizer, rose Bengal, in the surrounding
D2O solution favors the tertiary alcohol 5 with 90% selectivity at 60% conversion.17 Individual octa acid cavitands have a deep cavity (13.73 Å)
with a diameter of 11.36 Å to readily uptake guest molecules.49 Hydrogen-bonding interactions allow two octa
acid cavitands to form a closed capsule, which gives a discrete quaternary
complex.49 Interestingly, the hydroperoxide
formed was stable in the capsule and showed no rearrangement to 10. In comparison, host 1 displays a roughly
elliptical one-dimensional channel of ∼150 μM in length
with only two entrances and a diameter of 5 × 7.1 Å2 (Figure 1,
the channel highlighted in blue). Absorbed guests are trapped within
the confined environment under these conditions and the ROS must diffuse
within the long channels. Thus, host 1 is more similar
to zeolites, such as ZSM-5 zeolite, which has both straight and elliptical
pores with dimensions of approximately 5.2 × 5.8 Å2. Photolysis of 2 in ZSM-5 forms alcohols 3, 4, and 5 upon photooxidation and subsequent
reduction.50 The selectivity of alkene
photooxidation can be improved in cation-exchanged zeolites.55−57 For example, Na-ZSM-5 Y-type zeolite produced secondary allylic
alcohol 3 with 88% selectivity.50 From the reactant’s perspective, photooxidation in the “infinite”
1D channels of host 1 is a significantly different environment
than in distinct molecular capsules.

In summary, the photooxidation
studies of cyclohexene 2 in solution and in the solid
state are consistent with the proposed mechanism in Scheme 1. Our findings shed light on
the complex mechanistic pathways of photooxidations and highlight
degradation reactions that are detrimental to selectivity. (i) O2•– and BP/O2 exciplexes
are important in solution, leading to the oxidative degradation of
CHCl3 and subsequent formation of chlorinated products.
These biradical intermediates are likely also responsible for the
formation of significant amounts of biphenyl observed in reactions
carried out in benzene. Epoxide formation that was observed in the
solution could arise from either a type I or a type II process.

(ii) 1O2 is important in the solid-state reaction.
Cyclohexene 2 is a good match for the size and shape
of the host 1 channel and forms 2:1 host/guest complexes.
The encapsulated cyclohexene is accessible to oxygen gas and upon
irradiation likely undergoes ene reactions with 1O2.17,49,50,58 Encapsulation dramatically influences the products
observed. In particular, high selectivity was observed for 5, which undergoes efficient allylic peroxyl radical rearrangement
to enone 10 within the narrow channels. This pathway
appears to represent the majority of the products (5 + 10 ∼74%). The unexpected diol 9, observed
within our crystalline host, may be due to steric constraints that
aid the [2 + 2] process to give a proposed dioxetane intermediate
(Figure 5C), which
subsequently affords the observed diol either upon rearrangement in
the channel or upon extraction into a solution of triphenylphosphine.
The high conversion suggests that ROS readily diffuses along the ∼150
μM channels.

(iii) The lifetime of airborne 1O2 was also examined at the air–solid outer surface
of the host. Airborne 1O2 was generated by a
Pc plate that was physically isolated from the host in the solid state.
Minimal reduction in the lifetime of airborne 1O2 was observed when it came in contact with the surface of host 1. The data suggest that 1O2 quenching
is a surface phenomenon. Thus, we propose that 1O2 via the type II process is involved in the air/solid reaction with
cyclohexene 2 and is primarily within the confined channels
of host 1.

Conclusions
The assembled host 1 displays markedly different behaviors of ROS generated upon
photolysis in solution and in the solid state. UV irradiation of photosensitizers
host 1 and BP leads to the production of both 1O2 and O2•– in solution.
These represent key reactive species formed in the type I and type
II mechanisms. These species undergo unselective reactions with 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene
to afford epoxide-derived products as well as degradation of the solvent,
which generated chloride in CHCl3 and biphenyl in benzene.
It would be advantageous to be able to select a single ROS to direct
more selective photooxidations.

In contrast, within the nanochannels
of the host in the solid state, mainly type II (1O2) processes were observed. UV irradiation of the crystalline
host·guest complex in an oxygen atmosphere produced no epoxide
and afforded the tertiary alcohol 5 with enone 10 as a downstream product of 5. An unexpected
diol, 9, is proposed to form via formally a [2 + 2]-mediated
dioxetane in confinement. Overall, while both 1O2 and O2•– have access to the
channels of 1, it appears that 1O2 is the main reactive species with the bound cyclohexene 2. Comparison of reactions carried out in the air/solid and solution/solid
interfaces suggests that selectivity arises primarily in the interior
of the host. This is likely a result of confinement and/or directed
mobility of ROS within the elliptical subnanometer channels. We are
currently investigating the use of molecular dynamics to probe complexes
of host 1 with O2•– and 1O2 to see if these ROS species diffuse
freely or adhere to the walls. In particular, how does the encapsulation
of ROS species within nanochannels affect the mobility, lifetime,
and stability of the proposed intermediates? A greater understanding
of conditions that favor control over the selectivity of ROS generation
and their mobility within confined environments would help in the
development of more selective, next-generation photooxidation catalysts.

Host Synthesis and Guest Encapsulation
Host 1 was synthesized as previously reported.1−3 Crystallization
by slow cooling in DMSO (10 mg/mL) affords white needle-like crystals
with regular channels (7.1 × 5.0 Å2) that are
filled with DMSO.1−3 The host crystals were activated by heating to 180
°C using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a ramp rate of 4
°C/min.1−3 Once activated, the evacuated host can be readily
loaded with guest molecules by soaking the crystals in guest solutions
or through vapor diffusion.1,2

Photolysis
Irradiations
were carried out in a Rayonet reactor at 350 nm in Norell quartz EPR
tubes or sodium borosilicate vials.

EPR Spectroscopy
EPR was used to probe the types of ROS generated by host 1 upon UV irradiation while suspended in solution. In each experiment,
the sensitizer (1 or a standard) was added to oxygen-saturated
stock solutions containing known ROS quenchers such as TMP, DMPO,
or DMN. The solutions were UV-irradiated at 360 nm in a Rayonet reactor,
and the reaction was monitored over time by EPR or UV–visible
spectroscopy. More detail for each experiment can be found in the Supporting Information.

Quantum Yield Measurement
by EPR
The 1O2 quantum yield (Φ[1O2]) was determined by plotting the area of TEMPO
EPR signal versus time and obtaining the slope of each plot using
the equation Φ[1O2]sample= Φ[1O2]ref (msample/mref), where
perinaphthenone was used as the reference (Φ[1O2]ref = 0.97 in CHCl3), msample is the slope of the host plot, and mref is the slope of the perinaphthenone plot (Figure 2D).26,31 By this method, we estimate the Φ[1O2]host 1 to be ∼1% in CHCl3.

Quantum Yield Measurement by UV–Visible Spectroscopy
The 1O2 quantum yield (Φ[1O2]) was determined by plotting the difference between
each absorbance signal versus time and obtaining the slope of each
plot using the equation Φ[1O2]sample= Φ[1O2]ref (msample/mref), where
methylene blue was used as the reference (Φ[1O2]ref = 0.52 in CHCl3), msample is the slope of the host plot, and mref is the slope of the methylene blue plot.

Lifetime of 1O2 at the Air–Solid Interface
An
apparatus was constructed to deliver airborne 1O2 to a solid-quenching agent. The reactor consisted of a sensitizing
glass plate made by depositing Al(III) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate
(AlPcS) (∼5 × 10–5 mol) onto the bottom
side of a porous silica square (0.50 g, shape: 1.0 mm × 2.25
cm2). A 0.8 mM solution of AlPcS in MeOH was deposited
on the bottom face of the plate via slow evaporation. The glass plate
was placed sensitizer-face down on top of a custom-made plate containing
a well (sized: 1 mm × 1 cm × 1 cm). The solid trapping agent
(10 mg) was placed in the well. The sensitizer plate was not in contact
with the solid trapping agent and sat above it by 0.1 mm. A digital
ruler with a precision of 0.01 mm was used to measure the distance
between the sensitizer plate and the solid trapping agent in the well.
The sensitizer plate was placed 3.0 cm below a terminus of a multimode
FT-400-EMT optical fiber with an SMA 905 connector (Thorlabs, Inc.).
The optical fiber was connected to a 630 nm light source from a Nd:YAG
Q-switched laser pumping an optical parametric oscillator producing
5 ns ∼0.2 mJ/pulses. The output of the 630 nm light from the
laser yielded incident photons in a Gaussian distribution upon the
sensitizer plate. The 1O2 luminescence was detected
by a photomultiplier tube (H10330A-45, Hamamatsu Corp.) through a
1270 nm band-pass filter (FWHM = 15 nm). The 1O2 luminescence signals were registered on a 600 MHz oscilloscope,
and the kinetic data for the 1O2 lifetime (τΔairborne) were determined by a least-square curve-fitting
procedure. The 1O2 decay was observed in the
1270 nm phosphorescence upon irradiation of the sensitizer particles
with 630 nm light. A slow component for the 1O2 signal was observed (tenths of microseconds), which is attributed
to airborne 1O2 in the air gap between the sensitizer
plate of origin and the solid trapping agents. A reduction of the 1O2 lifetime (τΔairborne)
arises when the 1O2 encounters the air/solid
interface of the trapping agent.

Host 1 in Photooxidations
Photooxidations by host 1 in CHCl3 and
benzene resulted in multiple products, and characterization was attempted
only on key products. Relative conversion and selectivity were obtained
by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and the products
were confirmed using standards and/or the NIST database and literature
when applicable (Supporting Information Figures S20–S23).

Host 1 in Photooxidations in Solution
Cycloalkene 2 (21 mM) was stirred in oxygenated CHCl3 or benzene with host 1 (2 mg, 20 mol %). The
photooxidations in CHCl3 were UV-irradiated for 18 h and
diluted with CH2Cl2 solutions of triphenylphosphine
(21 mM) for rapid analysis by GC–MS. The photooxidations in
benzene were UV-irradiated over time, and aliquots (50 μL) of
the reaction mixture were removed over time (4, 8, and 12 h), diluted
into solutions of triphenylphosphine in benzene.

Host 1 Loading
with Cycloalkene 2
The activated host was equilibrated
with 2 for at least 24 h. TGA of the host 1·2 complex displayed one-step desorption from 25
to 80 °C with a weight loss of 8.2% (Figure S19 and Table S1). The host·guest stoichiometry was calculated
from the weight loss and corresponded to a 2:1 host/guest ratio. Because
the TGA indicates that alkene 2 slowly desorbs from the
host at ambient temperature, all solid-state reactions were performed
at lower temperatures (0 °C).

Solid-State Host 1 in Photooxidations
Host 1 (∼16 mg) was UV-irradiated in a borosilicate
vial saturated with oxygen for 5 h at 0 °C. After irradiation,
the complex was immediately sonicated in a solution of triphenylphosphine
(21 mM in THF) and analyzed by GC–MS.
