We prepared a series of ordered mesoporous
carbons embedded with
different contents of Cu nanoparticles (Cu/OMC-X)
and applied them to electrocatalytic synthesis of benzyl methyl carbonate.
The materials were characterized by many measurements, which showed
that Cu/OMC-X materials maintain highly ordered mesoporous
structures with high surface area and highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles.
As expected, the materials exhibit good electrocatalytic performance.
The optimal yield of benzyl methyl carbonate reaches 69.7% on Cu/OMC-3.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered as the main contributor
to greenhouse gases. At the same time, it is a cheap, nontoxic, and
recyclable carbon source, so that considerable attention has been
focused on the fixation and utilization of CO2.1,2 From that we can not only improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse
gas emissions, and air pollution to achieve a virtuous cycle of energy
utilization, but also can synthesize important chemical products.3−7 Electrocarboxylation is an effective method for fixing CO2, which could synthesize organic carbonates and organic carboxylates
by combining CO2 with epoxides,8 aldehydes,9 ketones,10,11 olefins,12−14 alkynes,15 halides,16−18 alcohols,19,20 and so on. In the previous investigations
of electrochemical synthesis of aromatic carbonates, Pt,21 Hg,22 and Cu19 are normally used as cathodes. Among them, Cu
is the most recommended, as Pt is a noble metal and Hg is a toxic
metal. Yamamoto et al.23 examined various
metals including Cu supported on activated carbon fibers as electrocatalyst,
which all show high current density and selectivity compared to the
planar electrodes. Thus, dispersing the metal on a high surface area
support could well result in increasing the activity of the electrocatalyst.

Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) has attracted much attention as
the substrate for metal nanoparticles and metal oxide nanoparticles.24−27 Compared with traditional carbon material, it has high specific
surface area, large pore volume, uniform and adjustable pore size,
and regularly arranged pore structure, so that the nanoparticles can
be highly dispersed on its surface and it can facilitate mass transfer
of reactants and products.28−32 Moreover, its good conductivity makes it an excellent candidate
for electrode materials.

In this paper, we prepared the OMC
embedded with Cu nanoparticles
(Cu/OMC) by a simple one-pot method using phenolic resins as the carbon
source, triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 as the template, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O as the metallic precursor,
and acetylacetone as the coordination agent. The Cu/OMC composites
were applied in electrosynthesis of benzyl methyl carbonate from benzyl
alcohol and CO2 which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Cu/OMC
A series
of Cu/OMC materials
were prepared by a one-pot synthesis process (see the Experimental Section for details). The wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of Cu/OMC with different Cu contents are shown in Figure 1A. The broad diffraction
peak at 2θ = 20–28° is a characteristic reflection
of amorphous carbon. All curves except curve f have diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 43.3, 50.4, and 74.1°, which correspond to the
(111), (200), and (220) reflections of Cu with the face-centered cubic
structure according to the JCPDs card no. 04-0836. It means that the
Cu precursor was completely reduced to metallic Cu during the carbonization.33 According to the Scherrer equation, the sizes
of the Cu nanoparticles are 17–30 nm for Cu/OMC-X.

Figure 1 Wide-angle XRD patterns (A) and small-angle XRD patterns (B) of
Cu/OMC-X: (a) Cu/OMC-1, (b) Cu/OMC-2, (c) Cu/OMC-3,
(d) Cu/OMC-4, (e) Cu/OMC-5, and (f) OMC.

Small-angle XRD diffraction was utilized to obtain the structural
information of the composites. Figure 1B shows small-angle XRD patterns of OMC and Cu/OMC-X, in which a diffraction peak of 2θ at about 1.0°
can be observed. It illustrates that OMC has a high-quality mesostructure.
In addition, when Cu was embedded into OMC, no obvious spectral characteristic
changes were observed at low 2θ angles, indicating that the
ordered mesoporous structure remained unchanged after the incorporation
of Cu.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were recorded
in air for
all composites (Figure 2). The curve of OMC (curve f) has a significant weight loss at about
500 °C, suggesting carbon combustion, which is higher than those
of Cu/OMCs. Weight-invariant phenomena were visible above 460 °C
for Cu/OMCs. The weight percentages of Cu obtained by combusting the
carbon components in the composites were 3.3, 5.3, 7.9, 10.0, and
12.6 wt % for Cu/OMC-1, Cu/OMC-2, Cu/OMC-3, Cu/OMC-4, and Cu/OMC-5,
respectively.

(b) Cu/OMC-2,
(c) Cu/OMC-3, (d) Cu/OMC-4, (e) Cu/OMC-5, and (f) OMC.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
are shown
in Figure 3A. It can
be clearly seen that Cu/OMC-Xs exhibit typical type
IV isotherms with H1 hysteresis loops, whereas the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm of OMC (Figure S1A) also have
the same characteristics, indicating the mesoporous structure of the
composites, which is consistent with the result of small-angle XRD.
The pore size distribution curves (Figures 3B and S1B) derived
from adsorption branches using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH)
model revealed the narrow pore size distribution in all samples. The
corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 1. It was observed that a certain
amount of Cu nanoparticles embedded in OMC helped increase the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size of OMC. It
may be because Cu embedded in OMC prevents the carbon matrix from
shrinking during carbonization. However, with the increase of Cu content,
both the BET surface area and the pore volume tend to increase first
and then decrease. During the process of Cu2+ to metallic
Cu, carbon is consumed on the one hand, and the pores may be slightly
blocked on the other hand.

In order to characterize the mesostructure
and the dispersion of
nanoparticles of OMC and Cu/OMC, the typical transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images are shown in Figure 4. The well-ordered arrangement of mesopores
was clearly observed for OMC (Figure 4f), giving evidence for the presence of an ordered
hexagonal mesostructure. For the Cu/OMCs (Figure 4a–e), directional and hexagonally
arranged pores can be clearly observed, which implied that the incorporation
of Cu nanoparticles does not destroy the ordered mesoporous structure,
which is consistent with the results from small-angle XRD (Figure 1B). Dark spots were
observed for the Cu nanoparticles, which were highly dispersed in
the carbon matrix. According to the particle size distribution histograms
(Figure 4, inset),
the average particle size of Cu nanoparticles is about 27, 27, 31,
34, and 39 nm for Cu/OMC-1, Cu/OMC-2, Cu/OMC-3, Cu/OMC-4, and Cu/OMC-5,
respectively. The particle sizes of nanoparticles obtained from TEM
are slightly larger than those obtained from XRD, which is similar
to others’ research.35 The unit–cell
parameters (a0) calculated from XRD are
about 10 nm (Table 1). As a result, some particles penetrate the carbon wall and become
stuck in two to four mesopores.

Electrochemical Catalysis
According to the above characterization,
the Cu/OMC-X materials have good characteristics,
such as highly ordered mesoporous structures, high surface area, and
highly dispersion of Cu nanoparticles. Next, in order to explore their
electrocatalytic performance, Cu/OMC-X materials
were used in electrocatalytic reaction of benzyl alcohol and CO2 to synthesize benzyl methyl carbonate.

It can be seen
from Figure 5 that
the electrode material has a great influence on the yield. On the
OMC electrode, only 12.0% of benzyl methyl carbonate could be obtained
(Table 2 entry 1),
which is much lower than those on Cu/OMC (Figure 5) and Cu (Table 2 entry 2), illustrating that Cu plays an
important role in the catalytic reaction. By comparing electrode materials
with different Cu contents at the same current density (Figure 5), we can see that as the Cu
content in Cu/OMC-X increases, the product yield
of the present increases first and then decreases, of which Cu/OMC-3
shows the best electrocatalytic effect. This law is consistent with
the change of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) value
of Cu/OMC-X (Table 1), which is measured by the underpotential deposition
of Pb (Pb-UPD, Figure S4). In other words,
the yield and ECSA first increase with increasing Cu content. However,
when the Cu content is increased to a certain extent, Cu nanoparticles
begin to aggregate and become larger (Figure 4), which reduces the ECSA and further reduces
the electrocatalytic performance. Cu nanoparticles supported on activated
carbon (Cu/AC) and Cu nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes
(Cu/CNT) materials (Figure S2) were prepared
and compared with Cu/OMC-3. The product yields on Cu/AC and Cu/CNT
(Table 2 entries 4–5)
are 29.8 and 40.2%, respectively, which are lower than that on Cu/OMC-3.
In terms of morphology of composites (Figure S3), not only Cu nanoparticles are less dispersive on AC and CNT than
that on OMC, but also the size of nanoparticles are bigger than that
supported on OMC. In addition, OMC has ordered uniform pores, which
facilitates mass transfer of reactants and products.36,37 Therefore, Cu/AC and Cu/CNT have smaller ECSA (Figure S5, Table S3), consequently
poor electrocatalytic performance.

current densities
and on different Cu/OMC-X: (a) Cu/OMC-1, (b) Cu/OMC-2,

a General conditions: two-department
cell, VMeCN = 15 mL, Cbenzylalcohol = 0.15 mol/L, j = 6.11
mA/cm2, CTBAI = 0.2 mol/L, Q = 1 F/mol, anode = graphite, CO2 pressure =
1 atm.

The yield of benzyl
methyl carbonate is also strongly dependent
on the current density. As shown in Figure 5, the yield increased first and then decreased
with the increase of current density on all five Cu/OMC materials.
The highest yield of 69.7% was obtained on Cu/OMC-3 at a current density
of 6.11 mA/cm2. When the current density is low, the corresponding
electrode potential is positive, so it is difficult to reduce the
chemicals, resulting in low yield. Conversely, when the current density
is large, the electrode potential is negative, so side reactions,
such as electroreduction of electrolyte38 or CO2, will occur, which reduce the yield. There are
many other important factors that influence the electrochemical reactions,
such as the concentration of benzyl alcohol (Table S1) and the charge amount (Table S2). The yield of the products increases first and then decreases,
with the increase of the concentration of benzyl alcohol and charge
amount. Under the optimized condition, the yield was 69.7%.

Conclusions
In summary, we used a simple one-pot method to synthesize OMC embedded
with Cu nanoparticles, which showed good electrocatalytic activity
for preparation of organic carbonate from alcohol and CO2. The content of Cu affects the specific surface area and electrocatalytic
activity of the material. The yield of benzyl methyl carbonate reaches
69.7% under optimized conditions on Cu/OMC-3. This work expands the
application of Cu/OMC composites as catalytic materials for electrochemical
fixation of CO2 to synthesize high value-added organic
chemicals under mild conditions. It may provide some new ideas for
designing cheaper and more efficient electrocatalysts.

triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (Mw =
12,600, PEO106PPO70PEO106) was purchased
from J&K Chemical. Phenol, formaldehyde (37 wt %), ethanol, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, acetylacetone, acetonitrile
(MeCN), tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), benzyl alcohol (PhCH3OH), potassium carbonate anhydrous, methyl iodide, ether,

Sinopharm Chemical. All the chemicals were used as received.

Materials
Synthesis
Synthesis of Resol Precursors
Resol, a low weight molecular
phenolic resin as the carbon resource, was prepared according to the
previous report work.39 The process was
as follows: 8.0 g of phenol was melted at 40–42 °C in
a round-bottomed flask; then 1.7 g of 20 wt % sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
aqueous solution was added under stirring; 10 min later, 13.8 g of
formaldehyde solution (37 wt %) was added dropwise under 50 °C;
then the reaction solution was heated up to 70–75 °C and
kept for 1 h. After that, the reaction solution was cooled down to
room temperature and the pH value adjusted to about 6–7 by
using a 2.0 M HCl solution. Then, water was removed by vacuum evaporation
at 50 °C. At last, the resol precursor was dissolved in ethanol
(20 wt %) for future use.

Synthesis of the Cu/OMC Composite
The Cu/OMC composite
was prepared by coassembly of the resol precursor, triblock copolymer
Pluronic F127, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O
via evaporation-induced self-assembly strategy. The process was as
follows: 1.0 g of Pluronic F127 was dissolved in 16.5 g of ethanol;
then 5.0 g resol precursor solution (20 wt %) was added and stirred
for 10 min. Subsequently, a certain of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O dissolved in 3.5 g of ethanol was dropped in
and acetylacetone with a molar ratio with Cu of 1:1.5 was added. After
further stirring for 12 h, the mixture was cast onto glass panes,
followed by evaporation of ethanol for 8 h at room temperature and
then thermopolymerized in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h. After that,
the obtained composite film was scrapped off and then carbonized in
a tubular furnace at 800 °C for 3 h under N2 flow
at the ramp of 1 °C/min below 600 °C and 5 °C/min between
600 and 800 °C. The obtained material was denoted as Cu/OMC-X, where X = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the
contents of Cu are list in Table 1.

Electrocatalytic Synthesis
The electrocatalytic
synthesis
process was performed by galvanostatic electrolysis with a direct-current-regulated
power supply (HY3003M, HYelec, China). Cu/OMC-X (60
mg) was mixed with 148 μL of sodium carboxymethylcellulose aqueous
solution (1 wt %), then coated on carbon paper (2 cm × 2 cm)
and used as a cathode. Galvanostatic electrolysis was carried out
in a two-department cell with a solution of 0.2 mol/L TBAI–CH3CN-0.15 mol/L PhCH3OH saturated with CO2 in a cathode chamber and 0.2 mol/L TBAI–CH3CN
in anode chamber, equipped with a Cu/OMC cathode and a graphite anode,
until 1.0 F/mol of charge passed. At the end of the electrolysis,
the catholyte was esterified by 0.3 mL of methyl iodide and 0.3 g
of anhydrous potassium carbonate at 55 °C for 5 h. After that,
the solution was extracted with ether, and the combined organic layer
was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. At last, the yields based
on the starting materials was analyzed by gas chromatography [Shimadzu
GC-2014 GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and a Rtx-5 column
(30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm)].

Characterization
The XRD patterns were collected on
a Bruker D8 ADVANCE instrument using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å) at 35 kV and 25 mA. TGA was carried out using a Metzsch
TGA-STA449F3 analyzer from 25 to 800 °C in an air flow of 80
mL/min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. TEM images were captured
by an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 microscope operated at 300 kV. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb-3B instrument after
evacuating the samples at 573 K for 6 h. The specific surface areas
were evaluated using the BET method and the pore distribution was
calculated by the BJH method from adsorption branches of isotherms.

Measurement of ECSA
ECSA of Cu/OMC-X was
determined by measuring the charge associated with the stripping
of an underpotential deposited Pb monolayer with a CHI 650a Electrochemical
Station (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Company). The saturated calomel
electrode and a Pt net were used as the reference electrode and the
counter electrode, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms were obtained
at a scan rate of 10 mV/s in a N2-saturated aqueous solution
of 0.1 mol/L KNO3-1 mmol/L Pb(NO3)2.
