We report simple
strategies to synthesize star-shaped molecules
containing different heterocycles integrated with a number of variations.
Here, cyclotrimerization, Vilsmeier–Haack reaction, Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling, and Van Leusen oxazole synthesis have been used as
key steps to introduce diverse five-membered heterocycles such as
furan, thiophene, and oxazole. More importantly, readily available
starting materials such as thiophene, 2-formyl furan, and 2-acetyl
furan were utilized. Also, the fluorescent behavior of these π-conjugated
systems was studied. C3-Symmetric molecules
containing furan moieties show a stronger fluorescence than thiophene-containing
star-shaped compounds.

Introduction
Symmetry plays an important
role in science, art, and architecture.1 In chemistry, symmetry improves the selectivity
by reducing the number of different reaction paths, thereby minimizing
the competing alternatives. A large number of C2-symmetric “privileged” ligands have been designed
to advance the asymmetric synthesis and chiral recognition. Many octahedral
complexes contain C3-symmetric molecules.2 In this context, limited numbers of C3-symmetric molecules have been designed as compared with C2-symmetric molecules. Initially, the synthesis
of star-shaped molecules was focused due to their esthetic nature.
Recently, their optical, electronic, and symmetry properties found
widespread applications. Our goal in star-shaped C3-symmetric molecules3 is to
design π-conjugated systems containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen,
oxygen, and sulfur. In this regard, we intend to incorporate thiophene,
furan, and oxazole moieties in C3-symmetric
molecules and investigate their photophysical properties. Moreover,
such C3-symmetric systems are subject
of interest as active materials for organic electronic devices such
as solar cells or field-effect transistors4 and as core units for discotic liquid crystals.5 More importantly, conjugated star-shaped molecules have
been used in electroluminescent devices,6 organic light-emitting diodes,7 and photovoltaics.4d,8

Results and Discussion
For the first time, we report a unified
approach to design a novel
class of C3-symmetric star-shaped molecules
embedded with thiophene, furan, and oxazole rings on a benzene core
substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. To incorporate different
heterocycles in the C3-symmetric molecules,
we intend to use Suzuki–Miyaura (SM) cross-coupling,9 Vilsmeier–Haack reaction,10 and Van Leusen oxazole synthesis11 (Figure 1) as the
key steps. To realize the strategy shown in Figure 1, we begin our journey with the trimerization12 of 2-acetyl-4-bromo thiophene (1) by using the known trimerization conditions.13 However, we did not get the desired product 2. Therefore, we changed the route to prepare the tri-bromo compound 2. Here, the trimerized product tris-thiophene 3 (65%) was prepared from 2-acetyl thiophene (5) by using
the literature procedure.14 Later, we attempted
different reaction conditions to introduce bromine atoms to obtain
the C3-symmetric tri-bromo compound 2. Unfortunately, under those conditions, the starting material
was recovered. Finally, we found that N-bromosuccinimide/acetonitrile/trimethylsilyl
chloride (NBS/MeCN/TMSCl) condition15 at
room temperature gave the desired tri-brominated product 2 in 88% yield (Scheme 1).

Figure 1 Retrosynthetic route to different heterocyclic rings containing C3-symmetric derivatives.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Tri-bromo Thiophene Derivative 2
Next, to install various heterocycles
in C3-symmetric molecules, we performed
the SM cross-coupling reaction
by treating the tri-bromo compound 2 with 5-formylfuran-2-yl
boronic acid using Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst and K2CO3 or Na2CO3 as a base in
tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and water (1:1:1) under reflux conditions.
However, we could not get the desired tri-aldehyde. To test the reactivity
of 2, it was treated with phenylboronic acid (7) and 2-furanylboronic acid (8) under SM reaction conditions
to deliver the corresponding cross-coupling products 4 and 6 in 84 and 78% yields, respectively (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Compounds 4 and 6 via SM Cross-Coupling
Reaction
Then, to introduce
other heterocycles at the second position of
the thiophene moiety in a star-shaped molecule 2 (or 3), the tri-aldehyde derivative 11 preparation
was required. Therefore, the tris-thiophene derivative 3 was subjected to Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with POCl3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 0–80 °C for 10 h delivered
the tri-aldehyde 11 in 15%. To improve the yield of 11, tri-bromo compound 2 was treated with n-BuLi and then reacted with N-formylpiperidiene
(10) in dry benzene at 60 °C to deliver the tri-aldehyde 11 (63%) with an improved yield. After obtaining compound 11, our next task was to prepare the tris-oxazole derivative 12. For this purpose, the tri-aldehyde 11 was
treated with toluenesulfonylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC)/K2CO3 in methanol under reflux conditions to deliver the
tris-oxazole 12 in 49% yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Oxazole Ring Containing
Star-Shaped Derivative 12
Different conditions to synthesize tri-bromo compound 14 via trimerization of the 2-acetyl-4-bromo furan (5)
was not successful. Alternatively, the known14c,16 trimerized compound 13 was subjected to bromination
with NBS/TMSCl in MeCN at room temperature and later at 50 °C.
Unfortunately, these conditions could not generate the desired tri-bromo
compound 14. After experimenting with several conditions,
we found that the target tri-bromo compound 14 could
be obtained in 65% yield by the treatment of 13 with
NBS in DMF at room temperature (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Star-Shaped Tri-bromo Derivative 14
Later, we performed
the SM reaction with 5-formylfuran-2-yl boronic
acid under standard coupling reaction conditions (Scheme 5). However, we could not get
the desired product. In this regard, compound 14 was
treated with phenylboronic acid (7) and 2-thienylboronic
acid (9) under SM reaction conditions to give the cross-coupling
products 15 and 18 in 88 and 83% yields,
respectively.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of C3-Symmetric
Derivatives 15 and 18 via SM Cross-Coupling
Reaction
Finally, the tri-aldehyde 19 (54%) was obtained through
Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of 13. Then, the aldehyde
groups were transformed to oxazole rings by Van Leusen oxazole synthesis.
In this context, the tri-aldehyde 19 was treated with
TosMIC/K2CO3 in the presence of methanol under
reflux condition to generate the star-shaped tris-oxazole derivative 20 in 58% yield (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Star-Shaped Tris-Oxazole Compound 20
Fluorescence Studies of
Star-Shaped Derivatives 4, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 20
Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements (Figure 2) were performed
in dilute solutions contained in standard quartz cuvettes. The superimposability
of the excitation and absorption spectra of the samples suggests a
high degree of purity of the compounds prepared. The emission spectrum
for each compound is obtained, with excitation at the wavelength of
the absorption maximum. The quantum yields were measured using quinine
sulfate dissolved in 0.5 M H2SO4 as a standard
(quantum yield Φ = 0.55).

Figure 2 Left panel shows the steady-state emission
(purple), excitation
(red), and absorption (black) spectra of the samples. Right panel
shows the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) data. λex = 340 nm, λem = respective fluorescence
maxima as given in Table 1.

The decay curves of samples 6, 4, and 12 show a single exponential
nature, whereas those of samples 15, 20,
and 18 show biexponential
nature (Tables 1 and 2). All of the
compounds show similar absorption spectra, with the onset of absorption
near about 275 nm suggesting a similar band gap in these compounds.
The synthesized products 6, 4, 12, 15, 20, and 18 exhibit fluorescence
behaviour in dichloromethane solvent.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple and useful strategy to
synthesize star-shaped molecules containing multiple heterocycles
via cyclotrimerization, Vilsmeier–Haack, SM cross-coupling
reaction, and Van Leusen oxazole synthesis as key steps under operationally
simple reaction conditions. The knowledge gained to prepare the key
building blocks 3 and 14 will pave the way
to complex C3-symmetric heterocycles.
Here, we have used readily available starting materials such as thiophene,
2-formyl furan, and 2-acetyl furan to generate various C3-symmetric molecules such as 4, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 20. Compounds in which the inner ring has a furan moiety are better
substrates as fluorophore than those containing thiophene in the inner
ring. The effect of the third moiety on the fluorescent nature is
significant as well, but the trends are reversed between furans and
thiophene moieties.

Experimental Section
General Information
Some of the reactions were performed
under nitrogen or argon atmosphere using well-dried reaction flask.
All of the starting materials and reagents were obtained from commercial
suppliers and used without purification. All of the solvents dried
used as reaction media over predried molecular sieves (4 Å).
Column chromatography was performed with silicagel (100–200
mesh) using a mixture of petroleum ether and EtOAc as eluent. 1H and 13C NMR spectral data were recorded on 400
MHz and 100 or 500 MHz and 125 MHz spectrometers using tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard and chloroform-d as the
solvent. The NMR data are in the order of chemical shifts, multiplicity
(s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet), and
coupling constants (J), given in Hertz (Hz). The
mass spectral data were recorded on a Q-ToF micromass spectrometer.
A high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed with a ToF
mass spectrometer in the positive ESI mode. The IR spectra were recorded
on Thermo Nicolete Avater 320 FT-IR and Nicolete impact 400 machine.

In a two-necked round-bottom
flask,
the trimerized thiophene 2 (100 mg, 0.3 mmol) in MeCN
(5 mL) was added portionwise NBS (174 mg, 0.8 mmol) at room temperature.
Then, TMSCl (0.1 equiv) was added to this reaction mixture under inert
atmosphere and the mixture was then stirred at room temperature for
2 h. After the completion of the reaction (thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) monitoring), the reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2

Steady-State and Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Absorption
and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco V530 spectrophotometer
and a Varian Cary Eclispe fluorimeter, respectively. Bandwidths of
5 nm were used on the excitation and emission sides for fluorescence
measurements. The samples were excited at 340 nm. The TCSPC measurements
were performed on an IBH Fluorocube time-resolved fluorescence spectrophotometer.
A Nanoled emitting at 340 nm was used to excite the samples. The instrument
response function was 800 ps. Further details about the instrument
are available elsewhere.18 The lifetime
values were obtained by fitting the fluorescence decays to multiexponential
functions19 by an iterative reconvolution
technique using reduced χ2 as the parameter for goodness
of fit (χ2 < 1.2 for a good fit). The fitting
function is as follows  where I(t) and I(0) denote the fluorescence intensities at
time t and time 0 after excitation, respectively. Ai and τi denote the amplitude and lifetime, respectively, of the ith component of the decay.
