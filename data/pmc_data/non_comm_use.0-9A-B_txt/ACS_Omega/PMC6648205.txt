In
this study, zein, a renewable natural biopolymer from corn,
was used to prepare a new biodegradable material with poly(butylene
adipate-terephthalate) (PBAT) by reactive blending in the presence
of poly(ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether) (PEGDGE). The effects of
blending temperature and zein content on the morphology and mechanical
and thermal properties of PBAT/zein blends with or without PEGDGE
were investigated. Because of the high reactivity of the epoxy group
in PEGDGE, the interfacial compatibility between zein and PBAT was
improved greatly, and zein exhibited as a spheral phase with smaller
size and finer dispersion in the PBAT matrix after the introduction
of PEGDGE. Therefore, PEGDGE served as a plasticizer and reactive
compatibilizer in the PBAT/zein blending system. Both the tensile
strength and elongation at break of the blends with PEGDGE were improved
greatly compared with those of the blends without PEGDGE but decreased
gradually with the increase of zein content. These findings may provide
a feasible way to utilize zein widely, and the new biodegradable blends
with excellent stretchability could be used as packing materials in
the future.

Introduction
In the past 70 years, the commercial products
from synthetic polymers
have been widely used, covering almost all fields of human life and
activities, and have made tremendous contributions to the development
of human civilization.1,2 However, the most initial sources
of them are from the nonrenewable fossil resources.3 With the rapid developing economy and the increasing population,
fossil resources are quickly depleted, which may limit the development
of the traditional polymer industry in the future.4 In addition, the worst thing is that most synthetic polymers
are difficult to be degraded in the natural environment.5 The debris formed by discarded plastics have
resulted in serious environmental pollution; even the accumulation
of small plastic particles has been found in marine animal bodies.6,7 Therefore, the design and development of environmental-friendly
biodegradable polymer materials to replace the petroleum-based polymers
may be the effective way to solve the above problems.

Corn,
one of the world’s highest yield crops, is an important
food and mainly used to produce corn starch in industry.8 Thus, a large amount of zein, the main component
in the industrial scraps, is produced. However, the scraps were often
sold as a low-value feed protein resource for animals because zein
lacks the essential amino acids of human body, such as lysine and
tryptophan, or even discharged into the river,9,10 which
has caused serious environmental pollution. Therefore, exploring more
efficient utilization for zein, a renewable natural biopolymer, will
have great significance for promoting the development of corn industry
and protecting the environment with remarkable economic and social
benefits.

However, the pure zein is difficult to be manufactured
into a certain
material because it is not thermoplastic and has very poor mechanical
properties.11,12 Therefore, we used zein as a
filler to prepare a new material with good mechanical properties by
reactive blending with poly(butylene adipate-terephthalate) (PBAT).
PBAT is a synthetic, biodegradable aliphatic–aromatic copolyester
with excellent stretchability.13 It is
obtained by condensation polymerization of adipic acid, butanediol,
and terephthalic acid, wherein the aromatic structure unit provides
good thermal stability and mechanical properties and the aliphatic
structure unit contributes to its excellent flexibility and good biodegradability.14 However, the low mechanical properties and high
price of PBAT have hindered its wide application. Therefore, many
biopolymers or synthetic polymers, such as soy protein,15 starch,16 cellulose,17 and poly(lactic acid),18 were introduced into PBAT by blending. However, the mechanical properties
of blends often decreased significantly, or the high toxic cross-linkers
(such as methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) were used.19,20

In this work, zein was introduced into PBAT by reactive blending
in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether) (PEGDGE).
The effects of blending condition and content of zein on the mechanical
properties of the resulting blends were investigated. It was found
that PEGDGE has played an important role in improving the interfacial
compatibility between zein and PBAT and mechanical properties of blends.
Morphology, thermal properties, water absorption, and degradability
of PBAT/zein blends were also studied. The new biodegradable material
with excellent stretchability could be used as the packing material.

Results
and Discussion
Mechanical Properties
Effects of Blending Temperature
on the Mechanical Properties
of the Blends
To explore the suitable blending and molding
temperature for the preparing process of PBAT/zein blend with good
mechanical properties, the mixtures of PBAT, zein, and PEGDGE with
a fixed feed mass ratio (90/10/5) were blended under various blending
temperatures in the range from 130 to 190 °C and then compressed
to form a sheet under the same temperature as their corresponding
blending process, respectively. The stress–strain curves of
the samples obtained from different blending temperatures (as the
molding temperature is equal to the blending temperature) are shown
in Figure 1a. With
the increase of the blending and molding process temperature from
130 to 175 °C, the tensile strength of the blends increased from
20 to 29 MPa, whereas the elongation at break increased from 720 to
1380% (line 1 to line 4 in Figure 1a). However, if the process temperature further increases
to 190 °C, the mechanical properties will start to decrease (tensile
strength: 23 MPa; elongation at break: 1150%, line 5 in Figure 1a). The melting point of PBAT is
about 120 °C.21 However, zein has
no a definite melting point because it will begin to decompose before
melting when the temperature is up to 200 °C.22 When the process temperature (blending and molding) was
set below 160 °C, the mixture of zein, PBAT, and PEGDGE was kept
under a partially melting condition with poor fluidity, which resulted
in the rather low mechanical properties of the blending sample. With
the increase of process temperature, the blending mixture had better
fluidity, which led to the blend sample with higher mechanical properties.
However, if the process temperature was too high, it could cause a
large range of decomposition of zein, which resulted in a decrease
of mechanical properties. Furthermore, the molding temperature was
fixed at 175 °C and just the blending temperature was changed
to manufacture the PBAT/zein blends with mass ration 90/10/5, and
the stress–strain curves of these blends are shown in Figure 1b. Similar results
could be learnt from Figure 1b to those in Figure 1a. Therefore, the temperature of the blending and molding
process was fixed at 175 °C in the following research studies.

of blending temperature on the mechanical properties of
PBAT/zein blends with PEGDGE (90/10/5, mass ratio). (a) Molding temperature
was the same as the blending temperature. (b) Molding temperature
was fixed at 175 °C. Blending temperature: (1) 130; (2) 145;
(3) 160; (4) 175; and (5) 190 °C.

Effects of Content of Zein and PEGDGE on the Mechanical Properties
of the Blends
By fixing the blending temperature and molding
temperature at 175 °C, a series of PBAT/zein blends with various
zein contents with or without PEGDGE addition was prepared. The typical
stress–strain curves of the blend samples containing different
zein contents with or without PEGDGE are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. Moreover,
the variations in the relevant tensile properties as a function of
different zein contents are displayed in Figure 2c–e.

Figure 2 Effects of content of zein and PEGDGE
on the mechanical properties
of the blends (the molding and blending temperature was 175 °C).
(a) Stress–strain curve without PEGDGE. (b) Stress–strain
curve with 5 phr (parts per hundreds of PBAT and zein mixture) PEGDGE.
Zein content in the mixture of PBAT and zein: (1) 0; (2) 5; (3) 10;
(4) 15; (5) 20; (6) 25; and (7) 30%. (c) Tensile strength; (d) tensile
modulus; and (e) elongation at break.

As shown in Figure 2a, in PBAT/zein blend without PEGDGE, the elongation at break
of
the blend sample containing 5% zein was 1300% (line 2), which was
close to that of the pure PBAT sample (1220%, line 1). As the content
of zein increased from 10 to 30%, the tensile strength and elongation
at break of the resulted material decreased rapidly. When 30% zein
was added, the tensile strength dropped to 3.7 MPa and the elongation
at break reduced to 30%. It may be due to the poor compatibility between
PBAT and zein. Thus, by considering the availability of the resulted
materials, the maximum addition of zein was limited within 25% in
the subsequent experiments.

With the addition of PEGDGE, the
overall performance of the blending
material has been greatly improved. For example, when 5% zein was
added, the tensile strength of the blend with PEGDGE increased from
28.2 MPa (that of the blend without PEGDGE) to 34.3 MPa, whereas the
elongation at break increased from 1300 to 1430%. When the zein content
was 20%, the tensile strength of the blend was 18.2 MPa and the elongation
at break was 860% with the addition of PEGDGE. Guo et al.14 reported that the mixture of PBAT and 20% soy
protein has a tensile strength of 9 MPa and an elongation at break
of 530%. Compared with PBAT/soy protein blends, the PBAT/zein blends
modified by PEGDGE had the better mechanical properties. In all cases,
the tensile strength and elongation at break of blends with PEGDGE
were better than that of the blend without PEGDGE.

With the
increase of zein content, both tensile strength and elongation
at break of the blends with PEGDGE were decreased, which is similar
to that of the blends without PEGDGE as discussed above. This can
be attributed to the bifunction of PEGDGE in the PBAT/zein blend system.
First, PEGDGE acts as a plasticizer, which can increase the mobility
of the polymer molecular chain and reduce the crystallizability,23 and thus improves the elongation of the blending
samples. On the other hand, PEGDGE serves as a reactive compatibilizer
in the PBAT/zein blend system. PEGDGE has two epoxy groups, which
are ready to react with the amino, carboxyl, or hydroxyl group of
zein and the terminal carboxyl group or hydroxyl group of PBAT under
the blending condition.24 The reaction
of epoxy group with PBAT and zein will improve the interfacial compatibility
between PBAT and zein, which is more helpful to improve the mechanical
properties of PBAT/zein blend and the stability of zein in the PBAT
matrix.

In addition, as learnt from Figure 2d, the tensile modulus of the PBAT/zein blends
increased
with the increase of zein content, which means that zein can increase
the stiffness of the blend material. It may help to eliminate the
intrinsic shortcomings of PBAT (soft and low tensile modulus). With
the same zein content, the addition of PEGDGE resulted in a decrease
in the tensile modulus of the blends, which is due to the plasticizing
effect of PEGDGE.25

Morphology
For pure PBAT and PBAT with only PEGDGE
(Figure 3a,b) sample,
the fractured surface is smooth with the same ripples which are caused
by deformation during the fracturing in liquid nitrogen.14 When 10% zein (Figure 3c) was added, the fracture surface of the
blend becomes rough. It can be clearly seen that the zein particles
are discontinuously embedded in the PBAT matrix phase, which is similar
to that in the PBAT/starch blend system.16 With the addition of PEGDGE (Figure 3d, 90/10/5), the zein particles with a smaller size
dispersed in the PBAT phase and the phase interface between zein and
PBAT becomes unclear. It means that the interfacial compatibility
between PBAT and zein in the blend is improved with the introduction
of PEGDGE.

Figure 3 SEM images of different PBAT/zein/PEGDGE blends. The blends of
(i–p) were etched using DMSO to remove unreacted zein. PBAT/zein/PEGDGE
ratio: (a,i) 100/0/0; (b,j) 100/0/5; (c,k) 90/10/0; (d,l) 90/10/5;
(e,m) 80/20/0; (f,n) 80/20/5; (g,o) 75/25/0; and (h,p) 75/25/5.

As the zein content increases
to over 20% (Figure 3e,g), many pores, which are formed by the
loss of zein particles after fracturing, can be observed in the fractured
surface of the blends without PEGDGE. Because of the poor interaction
force of the two phases, a large phase separation occurs in the blends,
which leads to the poor mechanical properties of the blends. When
5 phr of PEGDGE was added (Figure 3f,h), the pores can also be seen on the fractured surface,
but becomes smaller apparently.

To better understand the function
of PEGDGE in the blends, the
fractured blend sheets were immersed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
for 24 h and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
fracture surface of blends after DMSO treatment are shown in Figure 3i–p. Because
zein is soluble in DMSO,26 zein that was
not attached to PBAT by chemical reaction will be removed after being
treated with DMSO. As can be seen in Figure 3k–p, many pores on the fractured surface
of those blends containing zein can be found. However, the pore size
of the blends with PEGDGE is smaller than that of blends with the
same zein content but without PEGDGE but larger than their corresponding
sample before DMSO treatment apparently. These findings confirm that
the zein particles with smaller size are dispersed in the PBAT matrix
after introduction of PEGDGE, compared to that of samples without
PEGDGE. The better mechanical properties of PBAT/zein blends with
PEGDGE could be attributed to the finer zein dispersion in the PBAT
matrix and the improved interfacial compatibility between PBAT and
zein.

Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis
To detect the chemical
reaction of epoxy with zein and PBAT, the PBAT/zein blends with and
without PEGDGE were immersed in DMSO to remove the unboned zein from
the blends. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of PBAT
and PBAT/zein blends before and after being treated with DMSO are
displayed in Figure 4 (Figure 4b is the
enlarged portion of Figure 4a at a wavelength of 1700–1300 cm–1). By comparing with the spectra of PBAT (spectrum 1) and PBAT/zein
blend (80/20/0, spectrum 5), the two peaks at 1680–1630 and
1570–1520 cm–1 can be found in the FT-IR
spectrum of the PBAT/zein blend, which are assigned to the characteristic
peaks of amide I and amide II of zein.27 It confirms the introduction of zein in the blend sample by blending.
After being treated with DMSO, the two characteristic peaks of zein
are disappeared in the spectrum of the PBAT/zein blend without PEGDGE
(80/20/0, spectrum 2), which meant that the free zein particles which
physically encapsulated in the PBAT matrix had been removed completely
after being immersed in DMSO. However, the characteristic peaks of
zein could still be seen in the spectra of the DMSO-treated PBAT/zein
blends with PEGDGE (90/10/5, spectrum 3; 80/20/5, spectrum 4). These
results from FT-IR analysis have provided clear evidence for the occurrence
of chemical reaction of epoxy with PBAT and zein during the blending
process, which led to the improvement of interfacial compatibility
between PBAT and zein. It is consistent with the observation by SEM.

80/20/0; line 3, 90/10/5; line 4, 80/20/5).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Dynamic Mechanical Properties
The glass-transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and crystallization
temperature (Tc) of PBAT and PBAT/zein
blends with PEGDGE are obtained with differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and summarized in Table 1. From Table 1 and Figure 5, when 5 phr of PEGDGE was added to pure
PBAT, the glass-transition temperature of PBAT decreases from −27
°C to about −36 °C. PEGDGE mainly acts as a plasticizer
to reduce the entanglement between the PBAT molecular chains.28 As the content of zein increases from 0 to 25%,
the Tg of PBAT in the blends with PEGDGE
increases from −35.9 to −31.2 °C (DSC). Because
the Tg of zein is higher than that of
PBAT,29 and the addition of PEGDGE causes
the PBAT segment react with the zein segment to hinder the mobility
of PBAT chain, which led to the increase of Tg of PBAT.

(6) 80/20/5; and (7) 75/25/5.

Figure 6 shows the
relationship between the storage modulus of the material and the loss
factor to temperature. It can be seen from Figure 6a that all blend sheets exhibit high storage
modulus at low temperatures and have a sharp drop in the storage modulus
around −25 °C, which corresponds to the glass-transition
process of PBAT in the blend. During the rubbery plateau period, the
storage modulus of the material remained stable. With the addition
of zein, the storage modulus of the samples increases, which is attributed
to the reinforcing effect provided by zein.30 It is consistent with the results from mechanical testing. As can
be seen from Figure 6b, the addition of zein causes the peak temperature of loss factor
to increase, which represents an increase in the glass-transition
temperature. Therefore, the effects of zein content on the glass-transition
temperature of PBAT/zein blends are similar to that obtained from
DSC analysis.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curves of pure PBAT, zein, and PBAT/zein blends with 5 phr of
PEGDGE are shown in Figure 7. Zein begins to decompose at about 200 °C and has over
20% weight loss at 300 °C (line 6). The blends with 20% zein
begins to decompose at 290 °C (line 4), which is caused by dehydration,
depolymerization, and decomposition of thermally unstable proteins
and carbohydrate units.31,32 In addition, the weight
of the blend containing 20% zein is reduced by 20% until the temperature
reaches 360 °C. This indicates that the thermal stability of
zein in the blends is greatly improved by blending with PBAT; thus,
the PBAT/zein blend has a good thermal stability.

zein, and PBAT/zein blends with PEGDGE.

80/20/5; (5) 75/25/5; and (6) 0/100/0.

Water Absorption and Weight Loss
The effects of zein
content and PEGDGE on the water absorption and weight loss in the
water of the blends are displayed in Figure 8. Pure PBAT had the lowest water absorption
because of its high hydrophobicity. As the content of zein increases
from 5 to 25%, the water absorption of the blend material increases
gradually from around 2 to 12%, which may be attributed to the plenty
of hydrophilic groups in zein,33 although
zein is insoluble in water. With the addition of PEGDGE (5 phr), the
water absorption of the blend material increases slightly (about 1%),
compared with that of the sample with the same zein content. Moreover,
the weight loss (line 3 and 4 in Figure 8) for all samples is rather low (<0.6%).
It means that most of PEGDGE was bonded tightly in those blend materials
by the chemical reaction of epoxy group with zein and PBAT, though
PEGDGE is a water-soluble compound. Therefore, these findings may
guarantee for the application of PBAT/zein blends in a humid and watery
environment.

blends with different contents of zein. Without PEGDGE: 1,3; with
5 phr PEGDGE: 2,4.

Biodegradability
The biodegradability of PBAT/zein
blends was tested by burying the samples in natural soil. As shown
in Figure 9a–d,
the surfaces of all samples are smooth with some ripples before degradation.
For pure PBAT, no significant change can be found in the surface of
the sample before 15 d and only a tiny crack (Figure 9m) can be seen and about 2% weight loss can
be detected after 30 d, which indicate the low degradation rate of
PBAT. With the addition of zein, after 3 d degradation, the small
crack (Figure 9f) can
be found on the surface of the blend sample with 10% zein, while many
holes appear on the surface of those blend samples with 20% (Figure 9g) and 25% (Figure 9h) zein. The degradation
rate of the blend samples increases with the increase of zein in the
blend. After burying in soil for 30 days, the blend sheet with 25%
zein was broken to debris, and the weight loss of the blend samples
with 10 and 25% zein had reached to over 26 and 53%, respectively.
Therefore, the introduction of zein can greatly enhance the biodegradability
of the PBAT/zein blend materials.

of pure PBAT and PBAT/zein/PEGDGE
blends after burying in soil for various degradation times.

Conclusions
A
new biodegradable material was prepared by reactive blending
of zein and PBAT. By the addition of the reactive plasticizer PEGDGE,
the tensile strength and elongation at break of the blends were greatly
improved compared with that of PBAT/zein without PEGDGE but did not
reduce too much when compared with that of pure PBAT. For example,
when the mass ratio of PBAT/zein was fixed to 95/5, the tensile strength
of the material increased by 22% and the elongation at break increased
by 10% with the addition of 5 phr of PEGDGE. Meanwhile, zein has shown
a reinforcing effect in the PBAT matrix, which led to the increase
of the storage modulus and glass-transition temperature of the blends.
Considering the mechanical performance of the blends, the addition
of zein may be controlled within 20%. This flexible blending strategy
can be easily extended to other polymer/natural macromolecule systems,
such as wheat protein, keratin, and so on. The biodegradable PBAT/zein
blend materials with good thermal stability and low water absorption
can adapt to the application in different environments. The introduction
of zein in PBAT may increase the competitiveness of PBAT in cost as
a degradable material in the market.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Zein (Z3625, moisture ca. 8 wt %) and DMSO
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). PBAT (TH801T, Mw = 24 350)
was purchased from Xinjiang Blue Ridge Tunhe Chemical Industry Joint
Stock Co., Ltd. (Xinjiang, China), having a density of 1.26 g/cm3. Zein and PBAT were dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C
for 24 h before blending, to remove moisture for avoiding hydrolytic
degradation. PEGDGE (S65149, >99%, molar mass: 400 g/mol) was obtained
from Shanghai Yuanye Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China)
and used as received without further purification.

Methods
Preparation
of PBAT/Zein Blends
The blends of PBAT
and zein were prepared in an intensive mixer with the following typical
process. The predried 6 g of zein and 54 g of PBAT were premixed at
room temperature using a mixer and then stirred in an intensive mixer
(HAAKE PolyLab OS, Thermo Fisher, USA) at a certain temperature for
10 min. For the PBAT/zein blends with PEGDGE, 3 g of PEGDGE was poured
into the intensive mixer with zein and PBAT mixture. Finally, the
obtained sample was compression-molded on a vulcanizing machine (GT-7014-H30C,
Taiwan High Speed Rail Testing Instrument Co., Ltd. Taiwan, China)
under 30 MPa molding pressure for 3 min at a certain temperature to
form a sheet. The obtained PBAT/zein blends with and without PEGDGE
were labeled PBAT/zein/PEGDGE: 90/10/5 (mass ratio) and 90/10/0, respectively.
The addition of PEGDGE was shown as parts per hundreds (phr) of resin
(the mixture of PBAT and zein), for example, 5 phr of PEGDGE.

Characterization
Mechanical Testing
According to
the Standard Test Method
for Tensile Properties of Plastics (ASTM D638-14), dumbbell samples
for tensile testing were prepared using a cutter from the blend sheets
and placed under 55% relative humidity for 48 h before testing. Tensile
tests were carried out using universal testing machine (Instron 5966,
Instron, USA) with a crosshead speed of 20 mm/min. At least five individual
replicates were tested for each sample to get the average value.

Scanning Electron Microscope
The morphology of the
cross section of PBAT/zein blends with or without PEGDGE was observed
using a scanning electron microscope (Ultra 55, Zeiss, Germany) at
an accelerating voltage of 1.0 kV. The blend sheet was fractured in
liquid nitrogen and sputtered with 60 s gold before observation.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
To check the reaction between zein
and PBAT with PEGDGE, the blend sheets (10 mm × 10 mm ×
0.8 mm) were placed in 300 mL of DMSO for 12 h, then washed with distilled
water thoroughly, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The FT-IR spectra
of the blend sheets before and after being immersed in DMSO were obtained
by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA) with the
attenuated total reflectance mode at 4 cm–1 resolution
using 64 scans in the range of 4000–500 cm–1.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
The thermal properties
of the blends were investigated using DSC (Q2000, TA Instruments,
USA). The sample was first heated to 150 °C at 50 °C/min
and held for 6 min to eliminate the thermal history of the sample,
then cooled to −80 °C at 10 °C/min and stayed for
10 min, and then reheated to 150 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
The dynamic mechanical
properties of the blends were studied using a dynamic mechanical analyzer
(SDTA861e, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland). The sample (10.5 mm ×
4 mm × 0.8 mm, 8–12 mg) was first equilibrated at −60
°C for 3 min and then scanned from −60 to 90 °C at
a heating rate of 3 °C/min with a frequency of 1 Hz in a stretching
mode, thereby obtaining the storage modulus and the loss factor. The
peak temperature of the loss factor is determined to be the glass-transition
temperature (Tg).

Thermal Analysis
The thermal stability of the blends
was investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA 1, Mettler
Toledo, Switzerland). Samples (5–7 mg) were heated in a range
of 50–600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen
atmosphere. All TGA were repeated three times.

Water Absorption
Tests
The water absorption and the
weight loss of the PBAT/zein blends in water were evaluated in accordance
with ASTM D570-98 (2018, Standard Test Method for Water Absorption
of Plastics). First, all samples (20 mm × 20 mm × 1 mm)
were dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h until constant
weight (as W1). The dried samples were
placed in distilled water, submerged for 24 h at room temperature,
then taken out from water, and immediately weighed (as W2) after wiping off the surface water. The wet samples
were again dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h until constant
weight and weighed (as W3). Five replicates
were tested for each sample to get the average value. Then, the weight
loss rate and water absorption rate are calculated by eqs 1 and 2, respectively, 1   2  

Biodegradability Test
The biodegradability of the PBAT/zein
blends was evaluated by burying the samples in natural soil according
to GBT 19275-2003 (evaluation of the potential biodegradability and
disintegration of plastic materials by the action of specific microorganisms).
First, all blend sheets (30 mm × 30 mm × 1 mm) were dried
in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h until constant weight. Then,
three individual groups of the blend sheets were buried in the soil
with plants at a depth of 20 cm. The moisture content and pH of soil
were kept at about 35 wt % and 6.0–7.0, respectively. After
3, 15, and 30 days, one group of the degraded sample was taken out,
washed with distilled water, and dried in a vacuum oven. The surface
morphology of the degraded blend sheet was observed by SEM.
