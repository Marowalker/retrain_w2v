Biodegradation
of ferulic acid, by two white-rot fungal strains
(Trametes hirsuta MTCC-1171 and Phanerochaete chrysosporium NCIM-1106) was investigated
in this study. Both strains could use ferulic acid as a sole carbon
source when provided with basal mineral salt medium. T. hirsuta achieved complete degradation of ferulic
acid (350 mg L–1) in 20 h, whereas P. chrysosporium degraded it (250 mg L–1) in 28 h. The metabolites produced during degradation were distinguished
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Bioconversion of ferulic
acid to vanillin by P. chrysosporium was also investigated. The optimum experimental conditions for bioconversion
to vanillin can be summarized as follows: ferulic acid concentration
250 mg L–1, temperature 35 °C, initial pH 5.0,
mycelial inoculum 0.32 ± 0.01 g L–1 dry weight,
and shaking speed 150 rpm. At optimized conditions, the maximum molar
yield obtained was 3.4 ± 0.1%, after 20 h of bioconversion. Considering
that the degradation of ferulic acid was determined by laccase and
lignin peroxidase to some extent, the possible role of ligninolytic
enzymes in overall bioconversion process was also studied. These results
illustrate that both strains have the potential of utilizing ferulic
acid as a sole carbon source. Moreover, P. chrysosporium can also be explored for its ability to transform ferulic acid into
value-added products.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the plant kingdom, ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic
acid), a natural aromatic compound, is ubiquitously found in the cell
wall of plants, including numerous agriculturally important crops.1 However, the advancement of agro-industrial operations
has led to a larger accumulation of ferulic acid in the form of residues
and industrial effluent. Various industries are producing effluents
containing ferulic acid, including those found in oil processing,
wine distilleries, and paper pulp–processing industries.2 Ferulic acid is being considered as an environmental
pollutant because it shows a toxic effect on the microbial growth,
even at a low concentration.3 Numerous
investigations have reported the utilization of ferulic acid as a
sole carbon source for microbial growth.4 However, most of the intermediates of the degradation process are
toxic pollutants. Several methods have been studied for degradation
of the pollutant, including chemical oxidation and photodegradation
because of their capabilities to assist the degradation of ferulic
acid in a contaminated environment. Advanced oxidation process, a
chemical oxidation method, has been studied for effective degradation
of ferulic acid; however, it is an expensive process and not ideal
with respect to economical aspect.5 Similarly,
photocatalysis has demonstrated its potential of degrading ferulic
acid effectively. However, this approach has the main disadvantages
of poor stability and non-recovery of photocatalysts.6 Microbial degradation of xenobiotics has been an attraction
for the scientific community because it is a green process and can
be carried out at mild reaction conditions. Therefore, microorganisms
with the ability to effectively degrade ferulic acid along with its
intermediates should be explored for their potential application in
bioremediation. Several bacterial1 and
fungal strains7 were isolated and identified
to evaluate their degradation abilities against ferulic acid.4 In general, various factors affect the microbial
catalysis during biodegradation of ferulic acid. A number of different
enzymes play a vital role in microbial transformation of ferulic acid
and ultimately influence the overall bioconversion process.

In the recent past, researchers have used a number of biotechnology-based
strategies to achieve synthesis and production of vanillin using substrates
including ferulic acid, eugenol, lignin, phenolic stilbenes, isoeugenol,
and aromatic amino acids by employing bacteria, fungi, plant cells,
and genetically modified microorganisms.8 Among these vanillin precursors, ferulic acid is the most relevant
candidate because of its chemical resemblance to vanillin9 and can be efficiently used for bioconversion.
Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is one of the most extensively
adopted flavoring agents in the food and cosmetics industries. It
is generally extracted from the species of vanilla orchid, including Vanilla planifolia, Vanilla pompona, and Vanilla tahitiensi. It is an essential raw material for the production of various pharmaceutical
drugs, such as dopamine, aldomet, and papaverine, and for the synthesis
of antifoaming agents.10 Vanillin has antioxidant,
antimicrobial, anti-mutagenic, and anticarcinogenic properties. These
properties are mainly associated with the phenolic nature of vanillin.11 Because there is limited availability of vanilla
pods around the world, the “natural” vanillin produced
is highly expensive. The thriving global market for natural vanillin
demands higher supply. To fulfill the demand, chemically synthesized
form of vanillin is an efficient and comparatively cheaper alternative.8 Vanillin is being synthetically derived from
several raw materials, such as lignin, eugenol, glyoxylic acid, aromatic
amino acid, and guaiacol. A growing interest for natural flavors in
food and cosmetic industries has led researchers to find an alternate
biotechnological approach to produce natural vanillin. Vanillin can
be obtained by biotransformation using natural substrates such as
eugenol, isoeugenol, ferulic acid, and glucose, among others. Moreover,
vanillin obtained via biotransformation meets the guidelines of international
legislation, which defines “natural products” to include
materials produced by microbial transformation using living cells
or their enzymes.12 Earlier findings suggest
that yield obtained from synthesis and production of vanillin by enzymatic
catalysis is comparatively lower than that of the whole cell biocatalysis.
Therefore, bioconversion by whole cell system has been considered
as a significant and efficient way for the bulk production of vanillin.13,14 Also, vanillin production by bioconversion has several advantages
over chemical processes because these are environment-friendly, substrate-specific
processes and can be carried out at relatively mild reaction conditions.4

Recently, several microbial species have
been investigated for
their ability to produce vanillin via biotransformation of ferulic
acid or other structurally similar substrates. On the basis of initial
reactions associated with bioconversion of ferulic acid, five major
pathways have been identified: a reductive pathway, non-oxidative
decarboxylation, CoA-dependent β-oxidation, and CoA-dependent
and CoA-independent retro-aldol reaction pathways.8 A few microorganisms have evolved and could carry bioconversion
of ferulic acid using multiple pathways.15 During catabolism of ferulic acid, vanillin formation is an intermediate
step. Also, many organisms are able to catabolize the vanillin formed
into other products rapidly.15

Several
bacterial species such as Streptomyces setonii and Pseudomonas putida were investigated
for the bioconversion of ferulic acid. P. putida was found to be producing vanillic acid after 24 h, whereas accumulation
of vanillin (68% molar yield over a period of 50–60 h) was
observed in S. setonii when ferulic
acid was provided with initial concentration of 6 g L–1.12 In another report, Bacillus subtilis could obtain 60.43% molar yield
of vanillin in 20–30 h of incubation when initial concentration
was 1.5 g L–1 of ferulic acid.16 The biodegradation of ferulic acid involving bacteria has
been widely reported with efficient yield. However, biodegradation
of ferulic acid by fungi has been underexplored when compared to the
studies related to bacteria. Filamentous fungi produce potent enzymes
that can team up more efficiently to break down lignocellulosic biomass
than those produced by other microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast.17 White-rot fungi are reported for their ability
to secrete extracellular degrading enzymes, including Lac (laccase),
LiP (lignin peroxidase), and MnP (manganese peroxidase). Apart from
lignin decomposition, these ligninolytic enzymes can also oxidize
phenolic and methoxyphenolic compounds, demethylate methoxyl groups,
and decarboxylate them.18 Therefore, white-rot
fungi should be explored for their untapped potential in degradation
of aromatic pollutants. Several non-white rot fungal strains such
as Paecilomyces variotii(19) and Fusarium solani(20) can transform ferulic acid to vanillin
along with several other metabolites over a period of 24 and 48 h
of incubation, respectively. Although several non-white rot fungal
strains were reported for bioconversion of ferulic acid, a limited
number of white-rot fungi have been reported for degradation of ferulic
acid.19Schizophyllum commune, a white-rot fungi, has degraded ferulic acid (initial concentration
of 97.09 mg L–1 in 16 days of incubation) into 4-vinylguaiacol,
which was further oxidized to vanillin and vanillic acid.21 In another investigation, trametes sp. formed coniferyl alcohol and coniferyl aldehyde during ferulic
acid degradation.22 Although bioconversion
of ferulic acid has been extensively investigated with numerous microorganisms,
these reports essentially focused on the yield of vanillin by isolated
and identified microbial strains. Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes hirsuta are white-rot
fungal strains widely reported for their ability to express ligninolytic
enzymes (laccase and lignin peroxidase) while degrading a number of
xenobiotics.23,24 Despite having the potential
of being a promising candidate in ferulic acid degradation, the role
of ligninolytic enzymes of white-rot fungi in the overall degradation
process has not been orderly investigated.

In the current investigation,
we screened two white-rot fungi (T. hirsuta MTCC-1171 and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106)
for their ferulic acid–degrading capabilities
along with their response to varying concentrations of ferulic acid.
Moreover, the major role of Lac in ferulic acid degradation has also
been assessed. To the best of our understanding, there has been no
record on the systemic examination of experimental factors that influence
the degradation and bioconversion of ferulic acid using T. hirsuta MTCC-1171 and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106. It was also worthy of consideration to investigate the
ability of white-rot fungi in the transformation of ferulic acid to
natural vanillin.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals
Malt extract and other
media components were procured from Himedia Ltd. (Mumbai, India).
S. D. Fine-Chem. Ltd. (Mumbai) provided the following chemicals: guaiacol,
veratryl alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide (50% w/v). Ferulic acid and
vanillin (purity ≥ 97%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). Acetonitrile, methanol and ethyl acetate of high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade were procured from S. D. Fine-Chem.
Ltd. (Mumbai). HPLC-grade glacial acetic acid was purchased from Spectrochem
Ltd. (Mumbai).

2.2 Microorganisms
MTCC (Microbial-Type
Culture Collection), Chandigarh, India, provided the lyophilized culture
of T. hirsuta MTCC-1171. The strain
of P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106 was procured
from the National Collection of Industrially Important Microorganisms,
NCL, Pune, India. Initially, both strains were subcultured using malt
extract (2% w/v) agar for 72 h. The fungal strains were further grown
by submerging in malt extract medium and incubated at 30 °C at
125 rpm using an orbital shaker for the next 48 h. The strains were
maintained on agar medium containing malt extract and subcultured
subsequently for 30 days. Strains maintained on agar slants were stored
at 4 °C in refrigerator.

2.3 Inoculum
Preparation
The fungal strains
were activated by submerging in malt extract medium (50 mL, 20 g L–1) for 72 h at 30 °C at 125 rpm using an orbital
shaker. Grown fungal mycelia were collected and rinsed twice with
deionized (DI) water to discharge most of the accessible nutrients
from malt extract, and then added to 100 mL basal mineral salt medium
(1.0 g L–1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g L–1 K2HPO4, 0.2 g
L–1 KH2PO4, 1.0 g L–1 NaCl, 0.005 g L–1 boric acid, 0.002 g L–1 CaCl2·2H2O, 0.5 g L–1 MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.001 g L–1 CuSO4) in 250 mL conical flasks. These were further incubated
at 125 rpm using an orbital shaker for 2 h at 30 °C to further
consume any remaining nutrients adhered to the surface of mycelia
and then used as inoculums.

2.4 Determination of Ligninolytic
Enzymes Activity
Samples of culture were analyzed to determine
the activity of ligninolytic
enzymes. A flask containing media without microbial culture was used
as a control in all studies. Aliquots of culture were taken out at
a specific interval of time. Cultures were filtered through a muslin
cloth. The filtrates obtained were then centrifuged at 8000 rpm at
4 °C for 12 min using a Beckman cold centrifuge to separate residues
present in the supernatant. The activities of LiP and MnP were determined
colorimetrically, as mentioned in earlier work25 by a Spectroscan UV 2700 spectrophotometer (UV–vis
spectrophotometer, Chemito India). Laccase activity was estimated
using substrate (guaiacol 10 mM, pH 4.5) at 30 °C by measuring
the absorbance at 470 nm.26 Enzyme activity
can be defined as the amount of enzyme needed to obtain catalyzed
colored product min–1 mL–1, which is represented
in U mL–1.

2.5 Effect of Initial Concentration
of Ferulic
Acid on Degradation
Inoculum containing fungal mycelia (approximately
5.2 g L–1, equal to 0.21 g L–1 dry fungal weight) of strains were added to 100 mL basal mineral
salt media with ferulic acid (100–500 mg L–1) as the sole carbon source. Both cultures were incubated at 30 °C
for 48 h in a shaking incubator at 150 rpm. Mycelial growth (dry weight)
and the concentration of remaining ferulic acid were analyzed by collecting
fungal biomass and culture broth. A flask containing media without
culture was used as a control in all studies. An Agilent system (1290
infinity, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) provided with UV detector and
Agilent ChemStation Software was employed to analyze the remaining
concentration of ferulic acid. For HPLC, a C18 column (ZORBAX Eclipse
XDB, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size) was used. Mobile
phase containing acetic acid in DI water (0.2% v/v) and acetonitrile–methanol
(1:1 v/v) at a ratio of 73:27 (v/v) was used. The injection volume,
flow rate, column temperature, and wavelength were 10 μL, 1.0
mL min–1, 30 °C, and 280 nm, respectively.

2.6 Degradation of Ferulic Acid
Ferulic
acid with a concentration of 350 and 250 mg L–1 were
added in the media containing T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium, respectively.
These values were considered as the optimized concentration of ferulic
acid in degradation studies because the rate of degradation and growth
of fungal biomass were higher at these concentrations. Fungal inoculum
of T. hirsuta and P.
chrysosporium were added to 100 mL basal MSM media
(pH 4.5) containing 350 and 250 mg L–1 of ferulic
acid, respectively. Both cultures were incubated at 30 °C for
48 h in a shaking incubator at 150 rpm. A control flask of media containing
ferulic acid without fungal mycelia was managed identically. To evaluate
the effect of exogenously added carbon source (glucose) on the ability
of T. hirsuta and P.
chrysosporium in ferulic acid degradation, 1 g L–1 of additional carbon source (glucose) was added to
a test medium containing 350 and 250 mg L–1 ferulic
acid, respectively. The microbial cultures containing ferulic acid–only
and glucose as a sole carbon source were analyzed at 4 h interval
during incubation period to detect the remaining concentration of
ferulic acid and activities of degrading enzymes.

2.7 Effect of Inhibitor and Inducer on Ferulic
Acid Degradation
To further confirm the role of ligninolytic
enzymes (Lac and LiP) in the overall degradation process, another
experiment was conducted. Fungal inoculum of T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium were added to
100 mL basal MSM media containing 350 and 250 mg L–1 of ferulic acid, respectively. Other experimental parameters were
consistent with those specified in Section 2.6. Additionally, sodium azide 13.002 mg
L–1 (200 μM) was added as Lac/LiP inhibitor.27,28 After incubating from 0 to 32 h, aliquots of culture were collected
at 4 h intervals and were analyzed for the remaining concentration
of ferulic acid and activities of ligninolytic enzymes. Controls containing
no fungal mycelia were examined in an identical way.

The effect
of an inducer (veratryl alcohol) on the production of ligninolytic
enzymes and overall degradation process was also examined. Veratryl
alcohol (0.29 mL L–1; 2 mM) was added to 100 mL
basal MSM media containing ferulic acid. Other experimental parameters,
such as concentration of ferulic acid, fungal inoculum, and culture
conditions, were consistent, as previously specified. During the incubation
period, aliquots of culture were collected at 4 h intervals and were
analyzed for the remaining concentration of ferulic acid and activities
of ligninolytic enzymes.

2.8 Optimization of Bioconversion
of Ferulic Acid
All tests were conducted in batch mode using
horizontal shaking
incubator. To examine the impact of initial pH, temperature, fungal
inoculum, and rotational speed of shaking on the process of bioconversion
of ferulic acid by P. chrysosporium, varying temperature (25–45 °C), pH (4.0–6.0),
initial fungal inoculum (approximately 2.6–10.4 g L–1 wet weight), and shaking speed (0–200 rpm) were assessed
in this investigation.

2.9 Analytical Procedures
Samples were
taken out during the incubation period and products were further analyzed
by applying HPLC. At a specific time interval, samples were removed
and filtered through a muslin cloth to remove fungal biomass. The
filtrate obtained was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm at 4 °C for
12 min. The supernatant was again filtered using Whatman nylon filter
(0.2 μm) and was extracted with ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v). Ethyl
acetate fractions were concentrated using a rotary evaporator. These
were resuspended in methanol (1 mL) and were further analyzed by HPLC
using the method mentioned in Section 2.5. To identify metabolic products of degradation
process, samples of fermentation broth were extracted after respective
period of incubation and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) analysis was conducted by using a method mentioned
in an earlier report.29 Agilent 7890A system
(Waldbronn, Germany) with column (HP-5) was used. GC–MS analysis
was employed to treated samples along with the control. Fungal growth
was estimated by dry cell weight analysis by employing filtration
followed by drying process. To measure the biomass, a filter paper
was oven dried at 60 °C for 24 h, and weight was noted. Remaining
fungal mycelial biomass was weighed using oven-dried filter paper
and was determined gravimetrically.

Statistical analysis is
very critical to compile and evaluate the collected data. All experiments
were handled in triplicates to verify the reproducibility, and all
data are expressed as means ± standard deviation. The one-way
ANOVA was conducted using Microsoft Excel. To obtain the statistically
significant data, P-value less than 0.05 was considered.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect
of Ferulic Acid Concentration on Degradation
To evaluate
the capability of fungal strains for degradation, varying
concentrations (100–500 mg L–1) of ferulic
acid were used as a sole carbon source. Fungal biomass and concentration
of remaining ferulic acid were analyzed after incubation period of
48 h (Figure 1). In
case of T. hirsuta, it could completely
degrade ferulic acid when the initial concentration of ferulic acid
was 350 mg L–1 or lower. However, the degraded ferulic
acid reduced to 26.2–37.7% when it was provided with the initial
concentration of 350 mg L–1 or more. In case of P. chrysosporium, it could degrade up to 250 mg L–1 of ferulic acid. The concentration of degraded ferulic
acid notably reduced to 8.9–71.1% when the initial concentration
was more than 250 mg L–1. Also, mycelial biomass
concentration reached the maximum when the initial concentration of
ferulic acid was 350 and 250 mg L–1 for T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium, respectively. Therefore, these concentrations of ferulic acid were
chosen for the subsequent experiments. These findings suggest that
at higher concentrations of ferulic acid, it may have a toxic effect
on fungal growth of both strains, whereas a concentration below 350
and 250 mg L–1 could have no toxic effect on T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium, respectively. Similar findings demonstrated that xenobiotics at
a higher concentration could inhibit microbial growth.30

for degradation
and fungal biomass of T. hirsuta MTCC-1171
and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106. Data
are represented as the means of three independent replicates with
standard error bars.

3.2 Effect of Available Carbon Source on Degradation
The effect of the available form of carbon source on the expression
of ligninolytic enzymes and overall degradation process was studied
for the respective incubation period. Figure 2a depicts that in a culture of T. hirsuta, 350 mg L–1 of ferulic
acid provided 1 g L–1 of glucose; the activity of
Lac was slightly decreased along with a little delay in the overall
degradation process. However, LiP activity was also slightly decreased
in a culture of P. chrysosporium when
the same amount of glucose was provided containing 250 mg L–1 of ferulic acid (Figure 2b). Moreover, the delay in degradation process was comparatively
longer (∼4 h) in the case of P. chrysosporium when glucose was exogenously provided.

Figure 2 Effect of carbon source
(glucose) on the production of Lac/LiP
and overall ferulic acid degradation by T. hirsuta MTCC-1171 (a) and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106 (b). Error bars represent the standard error of three
replicates.

In this investigation,
it was found that both fungal strains could
grow on ferulic acid–only culture medium, which implies that
these strains can use xenobiotic as its sole carbon source for their
growth, even in a nutrient-deficient environment. Figure 2a shows the level of Lac produced
by T. hirsuta. Ferulic acid is capable
of inducing Lac production in trametes sp.31 Moreover, Lac activity can be influenced by
the presence of glucose as a carbon source in the media and can be
detected when glucose in the culture medium is almost exhausted.32 We did observe Lac activity from the fourth
hour of incubation. However, a noticeable increase in Lac activity
was observed after 12 h of incubation, indicating glucose depletion
in the medium. P. chrysosporium could
express a higher amount of LiP and MnP under carbon- and nitrogen-deficient
conditions.33 Although we observed slightly
better LiP activity in ferulic acid–only culture when compared
to the culture medium containing glucose (Figure 2b), we did not observe MnP activity in both
culture media. Lack of MnP activity in the medium might be because
of the possible inhibition of the enzyme by ferulic acid itself.34 Lac activity was also not detected in both ferulic
acid–only and glucose culture medium. Despite the fact that
ferulic acid induced Lac expression in the culture of T. hirsuta, P. chrysosporium could not express Lac in the presence of ferulic acid,35 even when glucose was provided exogenously.
Researchers have also reported that P. chrysosporium could not induce Lac production even in the presence of glucose
as a carbon source.36

These observations
suggest that both strains were competent enough
to degrade ferulic acid even when provided as a sole carbon source
by expressing ligninolytic enzymes. Moreover, the level of expression
of ligninolytic enzymes under nutrient-deficient conditions might
have affected the overall rate of degradation. Therefore, T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium can effectively develop its ecological functions for the degradation
of ferulic acid even under a carbon-deficient environment.

3.3 Role of Lac/LiP in Ferulic Acid Degradation
Figure 3a,b depicts
that ferulic acid was completely degraded by T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium in 24 and 32
h, respectively. Ferulic acid could induce the expression of Lac and
LiP in the case of T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium, respectively. However, when the
inhibitor was added to both of the culture media while keeping all
other experimental conditions constant, the Lac and LiP activity was
substantially decreased and only 0–16.3% (Figure 3a) and 0–21.1% (Figure 3b) degradation of
ferulic acid was observed after the period of incubation by T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium, respectively. Laccase-producing fungi have been used for bioremediation
of wastewater in the recent past.37 Researchers
have also highlighted the role of Lac in the degradation of ferulic
acid.7 Laccases are multicopper enzymes
that oxidize several aromatic pollutants by using molecular oxygen
through a mechanism comprising radical formation.37 As mentioned earlier, ligninolytic enzymes such as Lac
and LiP can also oxidize phenolic and methoxyphenolic compounds, and
demethylate methoxyl groups by attacking their methoxyl groups via
decarboxylation.18 A gradual increase in
enzymatic activities was observed along with a steady degradation
of ferulic acid during the incubation period. However, when Lac/LiP
activity was inhibited, the substrate was degraded much more slowly
when compared to the non-inhibition treatment. Although Lac of T. hirsuta could efficiently degrade ferulic acid
at a much faster rate, P. chrysosporium lacking Lac activity could degrade it but at a much slower rate,
indicating that Lac might have played a leading role in overall degradation.7 Therefore, this study suggests that ligninolytic
enzymes (Lac/LiP) determined the degradation of ferulic acid, to some
extent.

and ferulic acid degradation by by T. hirsuta MTCC-1171 (a) and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106 (b). Error bars represent the standard error of three
replicates.

3.4 Role
of Veratryl Alcohol on Bioconversion
Process
Veratryl alcohol has been reported for the enhancement
of Lac and LiP activity in white-rot fungi.38,39 Faison and Kirk confirmed that ligninase activity in culture could
be stimulated by veratryl alcohol.40 We
observed an enhancement in the activities of ligninolytic enzymes
of both fungal strains when veratryl alcohol was provided exogenously.
Although Lac activity was slightly increased in culture medium of T. hirsuta (Figure 4a), LiP activity was significantly increased in culture
medium of P. chrysosporium (Figure 4b). Veratryl alcohol
has been reported for enhancing LiP activity via enzyme stabilization
in P. chrysosporium(41) and possibly played a similar role when added exogenously.
Also, another report suggests that lignin and lignin-model compounds,
along with veratryl alcohol and related aromatic compounds, can induce
enhanced ligninase activity when added to the culture of P. chrysosporium.40 We
also noticed that veratryl alcohol could induce Lac expression to
some extent in culture medium of P. chrysosporium. This is probably because of the inducing effect of veratryl alcohol
on Lac expression in P. chrysosporium.35,42Figure 4a,b depicts that in the presence of veratryl alcohol, T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium could completely degrade ferulic acid in 20 and 28 h, respectively.
Enhancement in the rate of degradation because of the addition of
veratryl alcohol in culture medium of both strains indicates that
the level of expression of ligninolytic enzymes might have played
a vital role in the overall degradation process.

the expression of ligninolytic enzymes and
ferulic acid degradation by T. hirsuta MTCC-1171 (a) and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106 (b). Error bars represent the standard error of three
replicates.

3.5 Optimization
of Bioconversion of Ferulic Acid
The presence of vanillin
was detected only in the media containing
veratryl alcohol. Therefore, basal MSM provided with veratryl alcohol
(0.29 mL L–1, 2 mM) was used to further optimize
the bioconversion of ferulic acid. Figure 5a represents the effect of temperature on
the bioconversion of ferulic acid by P. chrysosporium at varying temperatures (25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C). As depicted
in the figure, the molar yield was slightly affected over a temperature
range of 30–35 °C, whereas it was found to be significantly
lower at 25 °C, possibly because of the lower affinity of the
substrate with the enzyme.43 However, a
drop in molar yield at a relatively elevated temperature (40 °C
and above) could be the result of thermal deactivation of enzyme because
of the conformational changes in protein folds. The maximum molar
yield of 2.1 ± 0.06% was observed at 35 °C. A possible reason
for this could be the that the optimized temperature for the expression
of ligninolytic enzymes by P. chrysosporium has been found to be in the range of 33–38 °C.44 Also, the temperature might have determined
the energy-dependent mechanisms of fungal cells in bioconversion of
ferulic acid.

Figure 5 Effect of different factors on the bioconversion of ferulic
acid
by P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106. Effect
of temperature on the bioconversion of ferulic acid (a), effect of
initial pH on the bioconversion of ferulic acid (b), effect of initial
fungal inoculum on the bioconversion of ferulic acid (c), and effect
of shaking speed on the bioconversion of ferulic acid (d).

It is well established that pH of the medium can
significantly
influence the microbial growth and bioconversion process. Apart from
altering enzymatic activities, changes in pH can also actively affect
the chemistry of the substrate in the surrounding. Moreover, it also
directs the activities of functional groups of microbial cell wall.45Figure 5b represents the effect of initial pH on the bioconversion
of ferulic acid by P. chrysosporium. As depicted in the figure, molar yield (%) significantly increased
over a pH range of 4.5–5.0. However, the yield was found to
be slightly lower over a pH range of 5.5–6.0. Also, at lower
range (pH 4.0), yield was significantly low. The maximum molar yield
of 3.1 ± 0.12% was observed at pH 5.0. These outcomes suggest
that the optimal pH for microbial growth of P. chrysosporium affected the bioconversion process. Because P. chrysosporium has been reported for higher activity of LiP at a similar range
of pH, it might have influenced the bioconversion process.46

The effect of the size of mycelial inoculum
on the bioconversion
process by P. chrysosporium was evaluated
using a varying range of fungal mycelial balls of almost equal size
(approximately 2.6–10.4 g L–1 wet weight),
as shown in Figure 5c. Enzyme production can be affected by the size of inoculum used
in the medium. When provided with a lower amount of fungal inoculum,
it may not be enough to initiate growth, which ultimately affects
the enzyme production, whereas excessive amount may originate competitive
inhibition.47 As the initial biomass quantity
increased, an enhancement in the yield was witnessed. The maximum
molar yield (3.4 ± 0.10%) was observed in the flask containing
fungal mycelial (approximately 7.8 g L–1 wet weight
equal to 0.32 ± 0.01 g L–1 dry weight). However,
a fall in yield was noticed with a further rise in mycelial inoculum,
possibly because of the faster depletion of nutrients,48 ending up with a drop in metabolic activities.

The effect of rotational speed of shaker on the bioconversion by P. chrysosporium was investigated by incubating fungal
mycelium in flasks on a rotary shaker provided with varying speeds
(0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 rpm). Other experimental conditions were
maintained as mentioned earlier. Figure 5d shows that the optimized rotational speed
of shaking was observed to be 150 rpm with maximum molar yield (3.4
± 0.10%), whereas as the rotational speed was increased further,
a significant decrease in yield was observed. At a higher shaking
speed, deeper physiological effects can occur in P.
chrysosporium, possibly affecting secondary metabolism
in general.49 Shaking speed also determines
the level of oxygen provided in the medium. The high level of oxygen
concentration favors an enhancement in microbial growth and can further
improve the process of bioconversion.

3.6 Dynamics
of Metabolic Products and Degrading
Enzymes Activities
When degradation products of both cultures
were analyzed, detection of vanillin and vanillic acid in culture
medium of P. chrysosporium was observed
(Figure S1). However, no vanillin or vanillic
acid was detected in a culture medium of T. hirsuta. In this study, we found that T. hirsuta could completely degrade the intermediate products and no secondary
pollutants were observed. Moreover, traces of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde,
benzoic acid, and coniferyl aldehyde were observed in culture medium
of T. hirsuta (Figure S2). trametes sp. has been reported
for biotransformation of ferulic acid into coniferyl aldehyde and
coniferyl alcohol.22 In another observation
during this study, the color of culture medium started turning into
light yellow coloration after 8 h of incubation and into dark yellow/brown
at the end of the incubation period. Similar outcomes were reported
where yellow-colored products were observed in oxidation of ferulic
acid by Lac from Myceliophthora thermophila.50 In another report, a fungal strain
of Sporotrichum thermophile was able
to transform ferulic acid into vanillic acid via 4-vinylguaiacol,
which was further converted to guaiacol.51 Lac can form quinone by oxidizing guaiacol and produce yellow-colored
products.52

P. chrysosporium ATCC 24725 has been reported for bioconversion of ferulic acid to
vanillin where green coconut agro-industrial husk was used as a source
of ferulic acid.53 In another report, ferulic
acid was transformed to vanillic acid using Aspergillus
niger K8, and it was further transformed to vanillin
using P. chrysosporium ATCC 24725.54 These prior studies revealed that the P. chrysosporium species are capable of transforming
ferulic acid to vanillin through various pathways. However, limited
reports are available related to the role of ligninolytic enzymes
during the degradation process. Ferulic acid has been reported for
the production of aromatic aldehydes, where alkyl side chain has to
be cleaved to obtain vanillin.55 LiP of P. chrysosporium is capable of cleaving similar alkyl
side chains in various lignin model compounds.56 From the aspect of biochemical reactions, bioconversion
of ferulic acid to vanillin could be a combined effect of decarboxylase,
oxygenase, oxidase, and oxidoreductase.1 Decarboxylation of vanillic acid by Lac or peroxidases has been
validated in an earlier report.57 Despite
the fact that P. chrysosporium species
does not produce ferulic acid decarboxylase, which plays a key role
in decarboxylation, in another report, LiP of P. chrysosporium could carry out enzymatic decarboxylation of oxalic acid in the
presence of veratryl alcohol.58 Veratryl
alcohol is known to activate a number of ligninase in white-rot fungi.38 This study also revealed that the veratryl alcohol
was an efficient inducer and was able to activate the multi-enzyme
system, which helped in utilizing the ferulic acid in the overall
bioconversion process.

Although a few researchers have reported
polymerization of ferulic
acid when treated with only Lac,59 there
are reports of production of substantial amount of vanillin in bioconversion
of ferulic acid by Sporotrichum pulverulentum (the anamorph of P. chrysosporium) containing Lac/LiP enzyme system.60 Note
that the extent of Lac activity compared to that of other ligninolytic
enzyme, such as LiP, might have played a key role in the overall bioconversion
process. We did observe accumulation of vanillin for a very short
period from 18 to 24 h. However, the vanillin was significantly decreased
thereafter, possibly because of further oxidation of vanillin to other
intermediates. These findings were consistent with another report
where vanillic acid and vanillin were accumulated in small amounts
by S. pulverulentum, in the presence
of ferulic acid.61 We also observed traces
of vanillic acid and coniferyl aldehyde in degradation products. Because
ferulic acid can be reversibly reduced to coniferyl aldehyde in basidiomycete,62 this could be probably because of the action
of Lac, which is an oxidoreductase. An alternative pathway, in which
ferulic acid can be decarboxylated to 4-vinyl guaiacol and further
oxidized to vanillin and vanillic acid, has been proposed for basidiomycete.63 Despite the fact that we could not detect 4-vinyl
guaiacol, a possibility of forming it in the process and its rapidly
getting further oxidized couldn’t be ruled out. No traces of
vanillin or vanillic acid were observed in culture containing Lac
of T. hirsuta. It might be because
of the comparatively high level of Lac activity, which led to rapid
polymerization of ferulic acid which further degraded it completely.
Also, Lac of T. hirsuta has been reported
for higher redox potential when compared to other laccase-producing
basidiomycetes, which might have contributed to comparatively faster
degradation process.64 On the contrary, P. chrysosporium produced a comparatively low level
of Lac. Falconnier et al. demonstrated that Pycnoporus
cinnabarinus I-937 with low Lac activity can efficiently
transform ferulic acid to vanillin.62 Lac/LiP
might have played a significant role and could be responsible for
the bioconversion, to some extent. However, other metabolic enzymes
might have contributed to the overall bioconversion process. In another
report, vanillate hydroxylase was found in P. chrysosporium and apparently decarboxylated the substrate.65 Moreover, P. chrysosporium also has genes for various oxygenase enzymes, including monooxygenase,
alcohol dehydrogenase, dioxygenase, intradiol dioxygenases, extradiol
dioxygenases, and many other similar aromatic compound degrading enzymes.66 Therefore, the accumulation of vanillin from
ferulic acid degradation might be the effect of all of these enzymes
altogether.

4 Conclusions
Two
white-rot fungal strains (T. hirsuta MTCC-1171 and P. chrysosporium NCIM-1106)
were studied for their capability to degrade ferulic acid. Both strains
degraded ferulic acid effectively in basal MSM, where they used ferulic
acid as a sole source of carbon and further identified its metabolic
products. T. hirsuta was proven to
be a better candidate for the degradation purpose of ferulic acid
because it achieved complete degradation of ferulic acid (350 mg L–1) in 20 h of incubation. Although P.
chrysosporium showed comparatively slower rate of
degradation, 28 h for 250 mg L–1 of ferulic acid,
vanillin was found to be accumulated over a period of 18–24
h. Further degradation of intermediates was observed and traces of
vanillic acid and coniferyl aldehyde were also found at the end of
the incubation period. No vanillin or vanillic acid was detected in
a culture medium of T. hirsuta. The
possible role of ligninolytic enzymes such as Lac and LiP was investigated
in the overall bioconversion process. Moreover, optimum bioconversion
conditions for the production of vanillin by P. chrysosporium were identified. Maximum vanillin accumulated was 6.61 ± 0.21
mg L–1 with molar yield (3.4 ± 0.10%) from
ferulic acid (250 mg L–1) at optimum bioconversion
conditions. This study revealed that the white-rot fungi could be
efficiently employed for degradation of ferulic acid, indicating that T. hirsuta and P. chrysosporium have a high potential for efficient applications in bioremediation
of pollutants. Moreover, the fundamental understanding acquired during
this investigation should contribute a valuable platform to investigate
the behavior of white-rot fungi associated with the bioconversion
of ferulic acid and its potential applications in the production of
vanillin.
