Ethyl lactate is widely used in food
and pharmaceutical industries,
but the complexity of the synthesis process, in particular, involving
the addition of organic solvents, hinders its application. Here, we
report a natural green strategy to produce ethyl lactate by exploiting
the synergistic fermentation of lactic acid bacteria and ester-producing
microbes using biomass as a substrate. Interestingly, it is worth
noting that the conjugate fermentation has a higher ethyl lactate
yield (3.05 g/L) compared to the mixed fermentation (1.32 g/L). The
ester production capacity was increased by 2.3 times. These entire
processes require only the addition of biomass without introducing
any organic solvent. In addition, the obtained catalytic esterification
system can reuse the ester-producing microbes by simple centrifugation
and maintain over seven cycles of catalysis while it retained a high
activity. We firmly believe that the results of this study will provide
new ideas for achieving sustainable green production of natural ethyl
lactate.

1 Introduction
Driven
by environmental concerns and concept of sustainability,
an increasing demand to use biorenewable materials instead of petroleum-based
feedstocks for chemical production has been noticed.1 As is well known, ethyl lactate is an agrochemical solvent
defined as generally recognized as safe and due to its low toxicity
it has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European
Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as a pharmaceutical ingredient and food
additives.1−4 At present, the research on ethyl lactate as a green solvent in
the food industry has become a hot spot because of its characteristics,
such as ease of recycle and reuse, no toxicity, and harmlessness.2 It has been reported that ethyl lactate has been
used as a green solvent to extract sterols, astaxanthin, and other
food nutrition additives from plants.5,6 In addition,
ethyl lactate can also be dissolved/dispersed in various pharmaceutical
active excipients in the applied pharmaceutical industry without destroying
the pharmacological activity of the active ingredient.1,7

Despite these numerous applications, it still remains a considerable
security challenge to apply ethyl lactate in food and pharmaceutical
industry due to the limitations of existing technologies and the residual
organic solvents. As a common technique, acid including sulfuric acid,
phosphoric acid, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, as a catalyst for
the homogeneous catalysis, have been discovered or engineered to synthesize
ethyl lactate.8,9 This technology, nevertheless,
suffers from equipment corrosion and high operational cost due to
the inherent shortcomings of liquids (their relatively discharge of
acid-containing waste and the occurrence of a higher proportion of
side reactions).1 As an alternative technology,
some researchers have used zeolites, ion-exchange resins, and simulated
moving bed membrane reactor (PermSMBR) to immobilize lipases for the
preparation of recyclable catalytic reaction systems, those strategies
are critical for green sustainable reaction process because of their
inbuilt advantages such as noncorrosion property and less environmental
impacts.10−13 Despite impressive advances, process complexity and economic costs
have increased significantly due to the extra addition of the carrier.14 In addition, immobilized enzymes are generally
applied to heterogeneous catalysis, where the introduction of organic
solvents is bound to pose a potential hazard to the biosafety of the
product.15,16 Therefore, it is of great importance to
develop efficient strategies with simple, green, and recyclable superiority
for producing ethyl lactate.

However, a great challenge is the
design and implementation of
completely green products and processes. There is no systematic and
reliable way to ensure that the chemistry implemented is green, since
the number of chemical synthesis pathways is vast, and in general
it is only possible to verify if a proposed manufacturing process
is “greener” than other alternatives.1 Biocatalysis is a relatively green and safe method because
it is derived from microbial fermentation of biomass (such as starch)
and has advantages in terms of reducing costs and simplifying operation.17 Our research aims to develop a green biological
reaction process for fermentation via lactic acid bacteria and ester-producing
microbes. The lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid by fermentation
using rice saccharification solution as a raw material, and an esterase
produced by the ester-producing microbes itself catalyzes the conversion
of lactic acid and alcohol produced by yeast into ethyl lactate. The
entire process is safe and simple as well as does not involve the
addition of any organic solvents. Furthermore, the recycling of the
ester-producing yeast can effectively reduce the cost and meet the
production needs.

Herein, a biocatalytic production of ethyl
lactate was developed
to solve the complex process and biosafety issues encountered in the
production of ethyl lactate. To this end, we first screened lactobacilli
and ester-producing yeasts that produce lactic acid and ethyl lactate.
Then, the ester-producing ability of the mixed fermentation (mixing
two kinds of bacteria) and the conjugate fermentation (using lactic
acid fermentation broth as a source of lactic acid instead of directly
adding lactic acid bacteria) was examined. A fermentation method with
a high yield of ester is selected for cyclic fermentation to develop
a safe and economical production method. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first attempt on the biofermentation and solvent-free
production of ethyl lactate, which is characterized by simplicity,
greenness, and recyclability. The excellent performance makes us believe
that this system will attract widespread interest from both fundamental
and industrial researchers because it unites some key advantages in
terms of green and sustainable chemistry.

2 Results
and Discussion
For the biosynthesis of ethyl lactate, one-pot
and a two-step procedure,
as depicted in Figure 1, was used. Considering that the synthesis of ethyl lactate is based
on lactic acid and ethanol as substrate, we choose lactic acid bacteria
to ferment biomass to produce lactic acid and ester-producing microbes
(ester-producing yeast) to produce alcohol. On this basis, the esterase
secreted by the ester-producing microbes is used to convert alcohol
and lactic acid into ethyl lactate. As can be seen from part a of Figure 1, the lactic acid
bacteria and yeast cocultured the transformed biomass to ethyl lactate.
For another, a two-step procedure involved first the transformation
of biomass into lactic acid by lactic acid bacteria; the second step
is to add lactic acid to the ester-producing microbe fermentation
broth to produce ethyl lactate (Figure 1b). After fermentation, the ethyl lactate was separate
by simple centrifugation. Also, the recovered microbe (precipitation
after centrifugation) is used for the next fermentation.

fermentation (b) to produce ester.

2.1 Evaluation of Lactic Acid Bacteria for Lactic
Acid Production
It is worth mentioning that lactic acid,
as a precursor for the synthesis of ethyl lactate, was obtained by
the fermentation of lactic acid bacteria. A satisfactory titer of
lactic acid was obtained via screening the acidogenic capacity of
four different lactobacilli (Lactobacillus fermentum (LF), Lactobacillus casei (LC), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR), and Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)). As shown in Figure 2, the four lactic
acid bacteria are all rod-shaped Gram-positive bacteria (Figure 2a–d, Gram
staining micrographs), which is consistent with the results of previous
researchers.18 After 72 h of incubation
for lactic acid bacteria, the acid production of the four lactic acid
bacteria reached a steady level. Notably, the lactic acid production
was greatly improved with further extending of the culture time, which
may be due to the saturation of the acid production inhibiting the
activity of lactic acid bacteria and enzymes. Interestingly, LR had
the highest acid yield (29.01 g/L) after being cultured for 72 h (Figure 2f). Comparison of
the yields with previous studies (in a similar system) confirmed that
the production of lactic acid was satisfactory.19 In addition, the larger calcium lysate further demonstrates
that LR has a higher acid production capacity than the other three
lactic acid bacteria (Figure 2a1–a4). This may be due to the
higher proliferative capacity of L. rhamnosus during culture (Figure 2e, maximum bacterial OD600 value of 6.8%). Thus, LR was selected
as the candidate acid-producing bacteria, and the culture time was
72 h, taking into account the simplification of the process and the
economic cost.

and LP (d). OD600 value of four lactic acid bacteria as

bacteria at different times (f).

2.2 Evaluation of Ester-Producing Yeast for Ethyl
Lactate Production
It is generally accepted that the formation
of ethyl lactate consists of two parts: (1) secretion of esterase
by esterogenic microorganisms and (2) esterification of alcohol and
lactate to ethyl lactate.20 Therefore,
an effective ester-producing strain is the key to obtaining high-yield
ethyl lactate (a schematic representation of ethyl lactate production
is shown in Figure 3h). Herein, we selected four common ester-producing strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), Wickerhamomyces
anomalus (WA), Candida antarctic (AC), and Monacus purpureus (AP))
to produce ethyl lactate. Optical microscopy image showed that all
yeast cells presented elliptical (Figure 3a–c), and the buds were clearly visible.21 As for the mycelium of AP, they basically have
the same size.22 Moreover, its branches
and septum were obvious (Figure 3d). As shown in Figure 3e,f, the increase of the lactic acid content in the
system significantly inhibited the proliferation of the ester-producing
microbes and the production of ethanol, since led to the deviation
of optimum pH of ester-producing microbes (optimal pH is generally
neutral) and the reduction of esterase activity. It must also be mentioned
that WA has a higher ethanol yield (Figure 3f) and dry cell weight (Figure 3e) than other yeasts (SC, AC,
and AP). At 3% lactic acid concentration, the remarkable ester-producing ability of WA is as high
as 2.73 g/L (Figure 3g, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) further identified
the product after fermentation; Figure S1), higher cell dry weight (3.2 g/L; Figure 3e) and ethanol yield (8.6 g/L, Figure 3f) further indicates that the
WA has higher lactic acid tolerance, which provides the possibility
of its high production of ethyl lactate. Therefore, we selected WA
as an ester-producing strain.

and AP (d). Dry cell weight (e) and ethanol yield (f) and ethyl lactate

lactate production (h).

2.3 Optimization
of Ester Production Process
For the production of green ethyl
lactate with safety in fermentation,
here we proposed to use a one-pot way, that is, mixed fermentation
(mixed fermentation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast, lactic acid
from the production of lactic acid bacteria, without additional lactic
acid) to produce ethyl lactate. As shown in Figure 4a, the amount of yeast increased quickly
at the initial stage, gradually slowed down with further fermentation
time, and finally became steady. Most interestingly, the amount of
yeast in mixed fermentation (lactic acid bacteria and yeast) was basically
the same as that in yeast fermentation (no lactic acid bacteria added).
After 72 h of culture, the proliferation of the WA reached its maximum
and became stable (9.8 × 107 cfu/mL). In addition,
optical microscopy image showed that yeast grew well and maintained
a highly viable cell rate during fermentation. In the early stage
of culture, there were fewer number of cells, and the cells exhibited
budding reproduction (inset image in Figure 4a). With further increase in incubation time
up to 72 h, the number of cells increased rapidly and the number of
viable cells was maintained (higher transparent yeast and few blue
yeast). As the incubation time increased, the number of dead cells
significantly increased. This is consistent with the observation from
the results of dry cell weight. These results indicate that the addition
of lactic acid bacteria does not significantly affect yeast reproduction.

Figure 4 (a) Effect
of lactic acid bacteria on yeast reproduction: transparent
is the live yeast (marked by the yellow arrow), the blue appearance
is the dead yeast stained with the methylene reagent (marked by the
red arrow), and the linear form in the inset is the lactic acid bacteria.
(b) Effect of different temperatures on the fermentation of mixed
bacteria.

To explore the ester production
efficiency of mixed fermentation,
WA and LR (highest lactate producers) were mixed (WA/LR, a viable
cell count ratio of 1:1) at different temperature (26 to 38 °C). Figure 4b shows that the
system had the largest ester yield (1.32 g/L) for 72 h at 30°C.
Moreover, higher and lower culture temperatures resulted in a significant
decrease in ester production. In particular, as the culture temperature
increased to 38 °C, the amount of ethyl lactate produced was
rapidly decreased (0.33 g/L), which accounted for only 1/4 of the
ester yield at 30 °C. Although we optimized the optimum ethyl
lactate yield at 30 °C, this yield is still unsatisfactory. To
further explore the reasons for the low yield, we investigated the
acid production of lactic acid bacteria at different temperatures
(from 26 to 38 °C). As shown in Figure S2 (see the Supporting Information), the acid production of lactic
acid bacteria (culture temperature: 26°C) is only about 16% of
the acid production at 38 °C, and its reproductive capacity (yield
of lactic acid, 4.67 g/L) is less than 20% at 38 °C (yield of
lactic acid, 29.01 g/L). In addition, it is generally considered that
the optimum temperature of the yeast is lower (less than 37 °C).
Therefore, we speculate that the difference in the optimal temperature
between WA and LR may be result in the low ester titer.

Given
that the temperature difference in the mixed fermentation
results in low ester production, using conjugated fermentation may
be an effective means to solve the problem. That is, lactic acid is
first produced by using sole LR and then the fermentation broth from
which the lactic acid bacteria are removed is added to the yeast culture
solution to produce ethyl lactate. Figure 5a clarifies the esterification kinetics of
WA (the culture temperature was 30 °C). Over time (0–1
days), the content of ethyl lactate increased slowly because the fermentation
broth contained less ester-producing yeast at this time (inset image
of Figure 5a), which
was in the logarithmic phase of reproduction. After 1 day of culture,
the amount of ethyl lactate in the culture solution rose sharply and
reached a maximum value (2.94 g/L) at 3 days. Conversely, by prolonging
the incubation time, the total amount of ethyl lactate was slightly
reduced, which was due to the decline in the viability of the ester-producing
yeast (Figure 5a).
In addition, the ethyl lactate consumed by itself was larger than
the amount of ester produced. As shown in Figure 5b, the yeast had a higher ester yield (3.05
g / L, for 3 days) at 26 °C; besides higher and lower culture
temperatures, the yeast had a lower ester yield. Compared with mixed
fermentation, conjugated fermentation is carried out at the optimum
temperature of yeast, which is beneficial for the increase in esterase
activity and can significantly increase the total ester content of
the fermentation broth, thereby obtaining a high ethyl lactate of
the natural fermentation source.

fermentation: transparent
is the live yeast (marked by the yellow arrow) and the blue appearance
is the dead yeast stained with the methylene reagent (marked by the
red arrow). (b) Effect of different fermentation temperatures on ester
production.

2.4 Cyclic
Stability of Biofermentation
Considering that biocatalysts
with good cycle stability further reduce
the cost of bioconversion, WA isolated by centrifugation was used
to catalyze the synthesis of ethyl lactate in a continuous batch.
It is worth noting that ester-producing yeast maintains a high survival
rate (more than 50%) and a complete morphology during the entire fermentation
cycle (Figure 6a).
Most surprisingly, WA retained more than 95% of its activity after
seven biotransformation cycles (examined after reactivation) (Figure 6b), showing high
reusability. This indicates that the whole process has little effect
on yeast cells, which is the key to the whole study.

bacteria during recycling (first

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have proposed a viable and relatively simple method
for producing ethyl lactate by fermentation from ester-producing yeast
and lactic acid bacteria. The strain obtained after simple centrifugation
can be recycled to the next fermentation, which produces a green sustainable
catalytic reaction and product separation in the reaction vessel.
This process saves resources for clean production and catalytic recycling
of ethyl lactate. Its circulation highlights more than seven cycles.
With this successful ester bacteria separation and recycling system,
the overall efficiency of the chemical process may be significantly
improved and the work-up method may be simplified. This biocatalysis
platform could be readily extended to other catalytic esterification
systems, such as the production of ethyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate,
and even ethyl butyrate, the essence of which is the replacement of
acidogenic strains. In addition, the key advantage of this strategy
is that it is a green process without any organic solvent, which provides
the possibility of the catalytic production of products such as food
and medicines, in accordance with the concept of green and sustainable
chemistry. Therefore, this strategy may open interesting avenues for
establishing green and sustainable platforms with synthetic natural
esters.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
L. fermentum (LF), Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. (LD), L. rhamnosus (LR), and L. plantarum (LP) were
gifts from South China Agricultural University (Guangdong, China). S. cerevisiae (SC, CGMCC2.3853), Wickerhamomyces
anomalus (WA, CGMCC2.470), and Candida
antarctica (CA, CGMCC2.3605) were obtained from China
General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (Beijing, China). Monascus purpureus (MP, GIM3.239) was purchased from
Guangdong Institute of Microbiology (Guangdong, China).

4.2 Growth Conditions
LF, LC, LR, and
LP were respectively inoculated into 10 mL of rice saccharification
medium at 2% (v/v) and cultured in at 37 °C in an incubator.
At the intervals of 12 h, the samples were taken to determine the
OD600 and lactic acid yield.23 The growth curve and lactic acid concentration curve of the lactic
acid bacteria were plotted to compare the growth of four lactic acid
bacteria and the yield of lactic acid. In addition, after culturing
for 3 days, 100 μL of the fermentation broth diluted 6 times
was applied to a rice saccharification solution plate to which 2%
calcium carbonate was added and cultured in a 37 °C incubator
until the single bacteria colony was observed. The colony trait, such
as color, edge, surface morphology, etc., and the size of dissolved
calcium circle were observed.24 Then, a
smear was prepared and the morphology of the lactic acid bacteria
was observed using an optical microscope (Olympus bx50, Japan).

SC, WA, CA, and MP were inoculated in rice saccharification solution
(12° Bx) containing different concentrations of lactic acid (0,
1, 2, 3, and 4%). The cells were cultured at a constant temperature
incubator at 30 °C for 5 days, and the dry weight of the cells
and the total ethyl lactate content were measured to compare the growth
of the four ester-producing strains under different lactic acid concentrations
and the production of ethyl lactate.25 Methylene
blue staining was used to count the alive cells and, according to
the count result, to draw a cellular growth curve. Specifically, a
drop of normal saline was added to a clean glass slide. A single colony
was then picked with an inoculation ring and applied to the center
of normal saline about 1 cm2, uniformly coated, and stained
with methylene blue. The agent was stained. After the dyeing was completed,
the yeast morphology was observed by an optical microscope (magnified,
40×). Finally, the stained yeast was placed on a hemocytometer
to count the number of cells and the viable cell rate.

4.3 Mixed Fermentation
The activated
ester-producing strain and lactic acid bacteria were inoculated at
a concentration (in a 1:1 ratio of viable cell count) in a rice saccharification
solution and cultured in a constant temperature incubator at 26, 30,
34, and 38 °C for 5 days. The lactic acid content and ethyl lactate
content in the fermentation broth were measured every 12 h.

4.4 Conjugated Fermentation
The ester-producing
yeast was inoculated into rice saccharification solution (sugar degree
12° Bx, pH 6.0) at a ratio of 4 and 3% lactic acid was added
(extracted from fermentation broth, which was concentrated by vacuum
freeze-dryer (Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) after
removing lactic acid bacteria by centrifugation). The final volume
of the solution was kept at 100 mL. The cells were cultured in a constant
temperature incubator at 26, 30, 34, and 38 °C for 5 days, and
the content of lactic acid and ethyl lactate in the fermentation broth
was measured every 12 h.

4.5 Ester-Producing Microbes
Recycling
To evaluate the reusability of the biocatalyst,
the ester-producing
microbes were isolated by centrifugation at 6000g for 5 min after each batch of reaction. Then, the recovered ester-producing
microbes were used for the new reaction under the same conditions.
The operational stability in each batch cycle was characterized by
measuring the relative ethyl lactate yield compared to the first reaction.

4.6 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
Analysis
The synthesized ethyl lactate was analyzed in the
following method.26 A sample (2 μL)
was injected onto the column (COSMOSIL 5 C 18 -MS-II, 4.6 × 150
mm2; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and eluted with 20%
(v/v) methanol containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid at 40 °C.
The concentration of ethyl lactate was determined from the chromatographic
data monitored at UV 210 nm processed by LC Solution software (Shimadzu).

Lactic acid concentration was determined using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC).16 A Shimadzu
LC-20AD liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu, U.K.) equipped with a Shimadzu
SPD-20A UV–vis detector, a Shimadzu SIL-20A HT auto sampler,
and a CTO-10AS VP column oven were used. The samples were eluted with
0.005 N H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min from
an organic acid analysis column (300 × 7.8 mm2 inner
diameter, Rezex-ROA organic acid column, Phenomenex Inc., U.K.) at
60 °C. Bioculture medium samples were centrifuged and filtered
as described above. Thirty microliters were injected into the HPLC
and the concentration of lactic acid was determined by interpolating
from a previously established lactic acid calibration curve. The coefficient
of variation for four samples was 0.9% for a concentration level of
0.5 M lactic acid.

4.7 Gas Chromatography Analysis
Gas chromatography
(GC) was employed for the determination of ethanol concentration in
the samples from four ester strain fermentations. Shimadzu GC-2014
(Shimadzu, U.K.) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30
m long Zebron ZB-5 capillary column (Phenomenex, U.K.) with 0.25 mm
internal diameter was used. The mobile phase used was nitrogen, while
the stationary phase of the column was 5% phenyl and 95% dimethylpolysiloxane.
Aqueous samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13 000g, and the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 μm
filters. Ethanol was extracted into hexane by vigorous vortexing 1
mL of the filtered sample with 2 mL of hexane for 1 min at room temperature.
One microliter of the extract was injected into the GC, and the temperature
of the column was kept constant at 40 °C for 3 min. The concentration
of ethanol was calculated by interpolating from a previously established
ethanol calibration curve.

4.8 Statistical Analysis
Each test was
conducted in triplicate. Analyses of variance for all the treatments
were carried out by Duncan’s multiple-range test (p < 0.05) using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, version 13.0).
