Lipid vesicles decorated with polysaccharides
have been proposed
as vehicles for drug delivery because the polymers confer to the vesicles
an enhanced stability, increasing the probability of the drug for
reaching the target cell. Here, we first test the affinity of dextran
sulfate (DS) for two different vesicle composition, and afterward,
we study the effect of DS on the liposome mechanical properties. We
found that DS binds to both tested membrane compositions. The interaction
of DS with the anionic membranes studied here is mediated by the metal
ions present in the aqueous solution (Na+ and Ca2+), being higher in the presence of Ca2+. Binding occurs
preferentially in regions of closely packed lipids. Strikingly, DS
did not affect the stability against detergent and the membrane rigidity
of none of the vesicles. Thus, the proposed stability increase induced
by this kind of polymers in drug delivery systems is not related with
a modulation of the membrane thermodynamic properties but to other
biochemical factors.

1 Introduction
Liposomes
have been largely proposed as vehicles for controlled
drug delivery. The work of several researchers over almost 5 decades
led to the development of important technical advances, leading to
numerous clinical trials in such diverse areas as the delivery of
anticancer, antifungal, and antibiotic drugs, gene medicines, anesthetics,
and anti-inflammatory drugs.1

In
order to efficiently deliver the drug, liposomes have to be
stable upon permeation and degradation until the target is reached.
In this regard, polysaccharide-coated liposomes have been appreciated
of being physically stable systems against biochemical and physicochemical
stresses encountered in biofluids especially after oral administration.
This kind of coated-vesicles showed reduced permeability to water-soluble
encapsulated materials in the presence of blood plasma or serum, increased
stability against enzymatic attack, and mechanical stability toward
biostimuli.2

Among the tested polysaccharides,
dextran-derivative polymers have
been widely studied, and it was found that conjugation of liposomes
with them results in favorable alteration of pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents.1,3−8 In this context, it is important to know at which level the polymer
acts on the liposome properties.

Dextran comprises a family
of an α—(1
→ 6) linked d-glucose main chain with varying proportions
of linkages and branches. They are versatile because of their solubility,
biocompatibility, and biodegradability.9 Their hydroxyl groups offer many sites for derivatization, giving
rise to a large number of polysaccharides, among which is the polymer
used in this study, dextran sulfate (DS). This polymer is a polyelectrolyte
with sulfate groups along its chain (see Figure 1), which provides a wide range of applications
such as an anticoagulant, an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus
and herpes simplex virus, and a reducer of cancer metastasis and tumor
adherence.9,10

Figure 1 Structure of (a) DS polysaccharide, (b) positively
charged mixture
of lipids: DOPC and DOTAP (methyl sulfate salt), and (c) negatively
charged mixture of lipids: DPPC and DOPG.

The structure of DS resembles that of the glycosaminoglycans
present
in the extracellular matrix, thus the coating of these polymers on
liposomes may help hiding the vesicle from the immune system and protect
liposomes from biodegradation, thereby increasing the permanence of
intact vesicles in the bloodstream.11 On
the other hand, polymers may stabilize the liposomes thermodynamically,
increasing the mechanical stability of the membranes.

Here,
we tackle the latter option, analyzing the behavior of membranes
decorated with DS. We studied two different kinds of vesicle composition
with the aim of shedding light on the DS–lipid interaction
and the consequent membrane modulation. The structures of the used
lipids are shown in Figure 1.

On one hand, we used membranes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane
(DOTAP) in a 9:1 proportion. PC is the major lipid in mammal cells,
and DOPC forms fluid membranes at room temperature due to the unsaturations.
Therefore, this kind of lipid is widely used as model for membranes12 and for drug delivery.13 The addition of a low amount of DOTAP is used in order to anchor
anionic polymers and thus confer stability to the vesicle for drug
delivery.14 This molecule was also used
to anchor DNA and other macromolecules.14

We also studied DS binding to vesicles composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG). These vesicles were
studied in order to investigate DS–anionic lipid interaction
in membranes with phase coexistence and in the presence of metallic
cations because preferential interaction with a denser phase in the
presence of Ca2+ was reported.15

This lipid composition was shown to form a stable vesicle
in the
presence of salt.16 Phase coexistence was
reported for different PC/PG proportions,16 as well as interactions between these lipids and Na+ and
Ca2+ ions.16,17 We chose an intermediate 1:1
proportion in which phase coexistence and ion–membrane interaction
are certainly established.

First, we tested the polymer–membrane
interaction and found
that DS binds to both membranes. In the case of the anionic membranes,
the interaction was favored by the presence of high amounts of sodium
ions or a moderate concentration of calcium ions. It was reported
that PC/PG membranes bind to Ca2+ with high affinity and
to Na+ with lower affinity,18−20 while DS interacts with
both ions (with a higher affinity for Ca2+).21,22 Therefore, we propose that a bridge-like interaction mediated by
both metal ions (Na+ or Ca2+) occurs, as previously
observed with Ca2+ in PC membranes,22,23 PC/PA membranes24 and also in DMPG monolayers.15 Our experiments indicate that the DS–Ca2+–PG bridge corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium. DS
partially displace Ca2+ ions bound to the membrane, forming
a loosely packed ionic layer. The optimal polymer–membrane
interaction occurs for 2–3 SO3– per Ca2+ ion. Additionally, we found that the polymer
interacts selectively with the denser regions of the anionic membrane,
indicating that this phase is a better platform for the polymer coating.

Subsequently, we analyzed the effect of the polymer–membrane
interaction on the liposome permeability, stability against detergents,
and membrane rigidity. The results indicate that the presence of a
DS-coating surface do not alter efficiently the membrane mechanical
properties, suggesting that the proposed effects in drug targeting
may be related rather with a protection of the liposome from the biochemical
agents present in the organisms.

2 Results
2.1 DS Binds to PC/PG and DOTAP/PC Membranes
We first tested
whether DS binds to monolayers of the different
lipid mixtures at the air–water interface using Brewster Angle
Microscopy (BAM). The reflectivity (Rp) of the air–water interface
at the Brewster angle increases when a film with refractive index
different from that of water and air is present. Rp depends on the
thickness and the refractive index of the film;25 high Rp values correspond to thick films with high refractive
indexes. Because the hydrocarbon chains of lipid films in a dense
phase are more stretched than in a disordered phase, denser phases
are thicker. Additionally, the refractive index of dense phases is
higher than for disordered ones,26 and
thus, Rp is high for regions of lipids in a closely packed state than
for less-packed phases, which translate to brighter gray levels in
the BAM images.

Because we do not know the refractive index
of the investigated films, we compared the Rp value in the absence
and in the presence of the polymer and analyzed the observed changes
as a qualitative measurement of the film thickening caused by the
polymer–membrane interaction.15

Figure 2 shows BAM
images of monolayers composed of DOPG/DPPC 1:1 (PG/PC from now on)
in the absence and presence of DS, with and without CaCl2. BAM images indicated the presence of segregated patches of coexisting
phases on both, NaCl and CaCl2 subphases (brighter regions
correspond to the condensed phase regions). The Rp value was determined
in both phases, and thus, two values of Rp are plotted in Figure 3, for each condition.
These experiments were performed at 15 °C, because at 23 °C
domains were too small for a suitable determination of Rp inside the
domains. The anionic monolayers showed higher Rp values on DS solutions
only in the liquid-condensed regions, indicating that the polymer
interacts selectively with the lipids in this phase state. Because
of this preferential interaction, the surface pressure corresponding
to the apparition of the liquid-condensed domains decreased in the
presence of DS (see Table S1) as previously
reported for DPPC, DPPA,24 and DMPC monolayers.27

Figure 2 Representative BAM images of monolayers composed of DOPG/DPPC
1:1
in the absence and in the presence of 0.4 w/v % of DS at the indicated
surface pressures. The gray levels were rescaled from the original
0–255 range to 9–52 for better visualization. The brighter
regions correspond to regions of lipids in the condensed phase.

and in the presence of 0.4 w/v % DS (red) and (c) DOTAP/DOPC 1:9 monolayer

Subphase composition: (a) 15 mM NaCl at 15 °C, (b) 10 mM CaCl2 at 15 °C, and (c) 145 mM NaCl at 23 °C. The Rp
values correspond to regions of the monolayer in the expanded phase
(■) or in the condensed phase (●). Each data correspond
to average ± SD of six different regions in at least four images.
(d) Mean value of Rp in the range of 25–35 mN/m for each monolayer
condition in the absence (black) and in the presence (red) of the
corresponding concentration of DS. For the mixture of DOPG/DPPC 1:1,
the mean values of Rp were taken from the condensed phase. The mean
values in the absence and presence of DS are statistically different
in the three conditions analyzed. In all conditions, the p values
are lower than 0.0001 for α = 0.05.

The increase in Rp when DS was added was higher on CaCl2 than on NaCl. Similar Rp increases were achieved with high
NaCl
and low DS concentrations (145 mM NaCl + 0.1% DS, Figure S4) or with low NaCl and high DS concentrations (10
mM NaCl + 0.4% DS, Figure 2).

The demixing process was not detected in the compression
isotherms,
and the general behavior of the film upon compression did not change
when the polymer was under the lipid monolayer (see Supporting Information S1). This indicates that the polymer
binds to the membrane externally, without incorporating between the
acyl chains, in the same manner than with DMPG monolayers the larger
affinity of DS for the denser phase indicates that this phase is a
better platform for the formation of the polymer sublayer.

The
domains in a DPPC/DOPG mixture are expected to be enriched
in the lipid that forms the denser monolayers, which in this case
is the PC component. We have previously shown that DS does not influence
compression isotherms and fluidity of DPPC monolayers in the absence
of Ca2+, while in its presence only a slight decrease in
the surface pressure for the phase transition (from 6 to 4 mN/m, see Table S1) was detected without viscosity changes.15 Thus, we have concluded that DS binds weakly
to DPPC monolayers in the condensed phase state. This was explained
considering a lower entropy decrease upon adsorption to these regions
of the monolayer because these regions are already ordered before
the polymer binding. Similar effects have been reported in the interaction
of peripheral proteins with membranes.28

All in all, the results shown here are intriguing because
they
indicate that DS binds selectively to regions enriched in PC and depleted
in PG, in spite that pure DPPC experiments showed low changes in the
presence of DS. Therefore, we performed BAM experiments for DPPC monolayers
over DS with and without Ca2+. The results are shown in
SM, in comparison with similar experiments using PC/PG (Figures S3 and S4). An addition of 0.1% DS induced
an increase in Rp (only in the domains) of similar magnitude than
that observed for PC/PG monolayers. It has to be remarked here that
these values are not a quantitative measurement of the DS–membrane
affinity because the refractive index of the lipid layer and of the
DS layer may be different in each system. The refractive index of
the polymer layer is expected to depend on the degree of hydration
of the polymer at the interface, as well as on its conformation, which
may vary from a system to the other, and therefore, we cannot make
a quantitative comparison between both systems.

The Rp values
of DPPC on DS indicate that PC is able to interact
with DS trough an ion metal-bridge even in the absence of PG. We next
compared the surface pressure at which domains appear in each system
when DS is added (see Table S1) and found
that for DPPC, in the absence of Ca2+, this parameter was
unaffected, while a 2 mN/m decrease was detected in the presence of
Ca2+. On the contrary, in the PG/PC mixture, the demixing
surface pressure decreases 5 mN/m at both conditions (with or without
Ca). This suggest that the presence of PG inside the domains favors
DS binding.

The cationic membranes composed of DOTAP/DOPC 1:9
(DOTAP/PC from
now on) were in a liquid-expanded state in the whole compression isotherm
(see Figure S1), and the polymer increased
the Rp values (see Supporting Information S2) at all surface pressures (Figure 3c), indicating polymer–lipid interactions at
all lipid densities, even in a disordered phase state.

Our aim
in this work was to study the binding properties of DS
on vesicles potentially useful for drug delivery, and thus, we now
focus on the Rp values at conditions comparable to those of bilayers,
that is, high surface pressures.29,30Figure 3d shows the average Rp values
at 25–35 mN/m for both membrane composition at each investigated
condition (for the anionic membranes, Figure 3d only depicts the values for Rp in the condensed
phase). An increment in Rp when DS was present was observed in all
cases.

The interaction between DS and anionic membranes15,24 and with PCs22,23 was proposed to occur through
the formation of a Ca2+-bridge when this bivalent ion is
present. In the absence of Ca2+, however, DS-membrane binding
was also detected, and therefore, we propose that this interaction
occurs by an analogous (though weaker) Na+-bridge favored
by DOPG molecules. A weaker interaction is expected as this metal
ion binds to PG/PC membranes with a 30 times lower affinity than Ca2+ ions19 and with DS, also with
a lower affinity than with Ca2+ ions.31

The behavior of molecules in bilayers and monolayers
is comparable
but not equal,32,33 and therefore, we subsequently
studied the polymer–membrane interaction in large unilamellar
vesicles (LUVs), by the determination of zeta potential and hydrodynamic
size. Zeta potential measures the electrostatic potential at the slipping
plane, which depends on the surface charge density (and thus on the
surface charge and on the vesicle size) and also on the double layer
potential, which decreases exponentially from the vesicle surface
to the bulk of the solution according to the Debye length (that in
turn depends on the salt concentration of the dispersing solution).34 As higher the vesicle charge density and lower
the ionic strength of the dispersion solution, higher the absolute
value of the zeta-potential.

The results for vesicles incubated
in solutions with increasing
DS concentrations are shown in Figures 4 and S6. The cationic vesicles
showed positive values of zeta potential and average sizes of 100
μm and acquired negative zeta potential values when they were
incubated in DS solutions, with a concomitant increment in the vesicle
hydrodynamic diameter (dH) up to about
150 μm, indicating DS-membrane binding.

showing the zeta potential values (ζ)
(a) or the average hydrodynamic diameter (dH) (b) as a function of the DS concentration. Composition: DOPG/DPPC
1:1 in NaCl 15 mM (black), CaCl2 10 mM (red) and CaCl2 25 mM (magenta); and DOTAP/DOPC 1:9 in NaCl 15 mM (a-blue)
and 145 mM (b-blue). The error bars represent the standard deviation
of two independent experiments.

The anionic vesicles depicted negative zeta potential values
both
in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+, but a decrease
in the negative charge (from −23 to −8 mV) was observed
when Ca2+ was present, indicating a partial charge neutralization
of the PG groups as previously reported.18,19 The incubation of the anionic LUV’s in solutions with increasing
concentrations of DS without Ca2+ led to a subtle but constant
decrease in the absolute value of the zeta potential (from −23
to −13 mV) with no
noticeable changes in dH. This shift toward zero in zeta
potential may be due to thinning of the double layer region caused
by the increment in ionic strength when the polymer with their counter
ions is added,34 because polymer binding
would make this value more negative. The slipping plane is proposed
to be located at distances of 10–1 nm from the charged
surface of the membranes,35 while the Debye
length changes from 2 to 10–3 nm for ionic strength
changes of 20–50 mM (values in the range that we are evaluating).
Therefore, at the investigated conditions, small changes in the surface
charge density of the LUVs due to DS addition may be hidden by changes
in the Debye length.

The incubation of the anionic LUVs in solutions
with Ca2+ and increasing concentrations of DS led to a
non-monotonic behavior
in dH and also in zeta potential, although
the latter was very subtle. The
zeta potential started at −8 mV, decreased to −16 mV,
and afterward, it increased to −14 mV, while dH first increased 60% of its initial value, and afterward,
it decreased.

Because DS interacts with Ca2+ ions,21,24 the non-monotonic behavior may be related with a competition of
DS and the lipids (PG group) for the bivalent ion. With this in mind, dH was determined for 1% DS in the presence of
25 mM of CaCl2, which corresponds to a ratio DS/Ca2+ equal to that in 0.4% DS (high value of dH and minimum of the zeta potential). Under this condition,
a high value of dH was found (magenta
symbol in Figure 4),
making evident a reversion of the effect found for DS 1% CaCl2 10 mM and matching our hypothesis. The same experiment was
not performed by measuring the zeta potential as this parameter also
depends on the aqueous ionic strength.34

2.2 Effect of DS on the Stability of Vesicles
Detergents are able to disrupt the lamellar structure of membranes,
intercalating between the lipid hydrocarbon chains and promoting micellization.36,37 We investigated here whether the presence of DS decorating the vesicles
was able to generate a protecting layer, promoting on the membrane
a higher stability upon detergent addition.

Figure 5a shows representative experiments
for PG/PC vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ (for the other
systems, see Supporting Information S7).
The addition of small volumes of TritonX-100 generated an increase
in the measured diffracted light, which was more noticeable for some
systems than for others. This increment was not related with shape
changes of the vesicles, as dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments
showed similar distributions than in the absence of detergent (see Supporting Information S8 as an example of the
performed controls), thus it might be related with detergent-induced
changes in the diffraction index. After this increase, the diffracted
light decreased abruptly reaching low values (70–80% lower
than the initial values). This decrease was always related with a
rupture of the vesicles, as determined by DLS experiments (see representative
experiments in Supporting Information S8).

Figure 5 (a) Representative experiments showing the percent of relative
turbidity (% RT) vs Triton X-100 concentration for LUVs composed of
DOPG/DPPC 1:1. Composition of the solutions: CaCl2 10 mM
+ DS 0 w/v % (black), DS 0.4 w/v % (red), DS 1 w/v % (blue), and CaCl2 25 mM + DS 1 w/v % (magenta). (b) C50%R vs DS concentration
for DOTAP/DOPC 1:9 in NaCl 145 mM; (c) C50%R vs DS concentration
for DOPG/DPPC 1:1 in NaCl 15 mM (red), CaCl2 10 mM (blue),
and CaCl2 25 mM (magenta). The data correspond to average
± SD of two independent experiments.

From duplicate experiments, we determined the concentration
of
TritonX-100 that promoted the rupture of 50% of the vesicles, that
is, a 50% decrease in the diffracted light (C50%R), and plotted
these values in Figure 5b,c. The C50%R values for the bare cationic vesicles were
similar to that of the decorated ones, indicating that the polymer
did not prevent the vesicle rupture by the detergent (Figure 5a). This suggests that DS covers
the vesicles forming a relaxed layer, leaving holes where the detergent
is able to access the lipid bilayer. Similar results were found for
the PG/PC vesicles in the absence of Ca2+, while in the
presence of the bivalent ion, C50%R decreased when DS was added, Figure 5c. This destabilization
can be explained considering that Ca2+ ions stabilize the
vesicles, notice that in the absence of polymer, the 10 mM of the
bivalent ion promotes a 1.7 times increase in C50%R. As already
proposed, the polymer competes with the lipids for Ca2+, influencing the Ca2+–membrane properties and
translating to a decreased stability upon TritonX-100 addition.

In order to test this proposition, experiments with 1% DS and 25
mM Ca2+ (the same Ca2+/DS ratio as with 10 mM
Ca2+ and 0.4% DS) were performed, and the obtained C50%R value was similar to that with less polymer but the same Ca2+/DS ratio (magenta bar in Figure 5c).

Aside from high vesicle stability
upon shocks, low permeability
is desired for vesicle-mediated delivery of soluble drugs. Therefore,
we tested the effect of DS on the permeability of the vesicles upon
addition of sublytic detergent concentrations following the fluorescence
of carboxyfluorescein (CF). Figures 6a and S7 show representative
experiments. The concentrations of TritonX-100 at which 50% of CF
escaped from the vesicles (50% increase in the fluorescence, C50%CF) are plotted in Figure 6b,c. For the cationic vesicles in the absence of polymer and
for the anionic vesicles with Ca2+, the C50%CF values
were similar, while for the anionic vesicles without Ca2+ it was about half those values, that is, the sensitivity of the
permeability upon detergent addition decreased in the presence of
Ca2+ for PG/PC membranes. DS did not affect the C50%CF value for the cationic vesicles and the anionic vesicles without
Ca2+. When the bivalent ion was present, the addition of
DS promoted a slight decrease of C50%CF (from 71 to 53 μM),
in concordance with the proposed DS–lipid competition for Ca2+.

(red) and presence of CaCl2 10 mM (blue). The data correspond
to average ± SD of two independent experiments.

2.3 Shape Fluctuations of Giant
Unilamellar Vesicles
(GUVs)
In order to study the membrane rigidity in the presence
of the polymer, we registered the shape fluctuation of individual
GUVs, which depends on the energy cost for this shape change in comparison
with the thermal energy.

As the viscosity of the solutions could
affect these measurements, we determined the shear viscosities of
the different solutions. Similar results were found as detailed in
SM5 (Figure S9 and Table S2). Thus, the differences found in the thermal shape
fluctuations of the GUVs are not related with the viscosity of the
surrounding media but to membrane rigidity.

In order to quantify
the effect of the polymer in the vesicle shape
and shape fluctuations, we recorded individual GUVs in each condition
(100 frames, 38 frames/min). Figure 7a shows two representative images of GUVs, and Movies
S1 and S2 shows the corresponding movies (Supporting Information). The shape fluctuations were analyzed using the
morphological package of ImageJ, two shape descriptors were determined:
the circularity (C = 4π·area/(perimeter)2)
and the aspect ratio (AR = longer axis length/minor axis length).
The values of C and AR were determined in each frame
along the movies, as shown in Figure 7b,c. Each vesicle was characterized with a time-average
value of circularity (C) and of AR and its respective standard deviation
(SDC and SDAR, see Table S3).

Figure 7 (a) Representative images for fluctuating (upper panelpanel) and
nonfluctuating (lower panel) GUV. Representative graphic of circularity
(b) and AR (c) as a function of the time for nonfluctuating (red)
and fluctuating (black) GUV.

The following three different conditions were studied, GUVs
composed
of: (1) DOTAP/PC in NaCl 145 mM, (2) PG/PC in NaCl 15 mM, and (3)
PG/PC in CaCl2 10 mM. Condition (1) was subjected to two
treatments: 0 and 1 w/v % of DS, while conditions (2) and (3) to three
treatments: 0, 0.4, and 1 w/v % of DS.

For a given condition,
we define the treatment that led to the
less fluctuating GUV population as the treatment in which the data
for SDC and SDAR yielded the lower value for
percentile 95th (P95th, i.e., the value below which 95% of the data
are found38). P95th values were determined
with a free software (InfoStat). The value of P95th of the SDC or SDAR data of the less fluctuating treatment
was taken as an upper limit (UL), and GUV population was separated
in two subgroups: “fluctuating” and “nonfluctuating”
vesicles. GUVs with standard deviations higher than the UL value were
considered “fluctuating GUVs” and the rest, “nonfluctuating
GUVs”. Figure 7, Tables S3, and S4 show as example the
analysis for GUVs composed of PG/PC in CaCl2 10 mM. The
UL value is represented as a magenta line in Figure S10, which in this case corresponds to the P95th value for
DS 0.4 w/v % (for SDC).

In each condition and treatment,
at least 20 GUVs were studied,
and the percent of fluctuating GUVs was calculated as  

This percent
was calculated for two independent experiments and
the results shown are the average ± SD of these two data.

Figure 8a–c
shows the percent of fluctuating GUVs for different DS concentrations
for the different conditions.

Figure 8 Percent of fluctuating GUVs for different DS
concentrations (w/v
%). GUVs are composed of DOTAP/DOPC 1:9 in NaCl 145 mM (a) or DOPG/DPPC
1:1 in NaCl 15 mM (b) or CaCl2 10 mM (c). The percent was
determined through fluctuations in the circularity (green) or the
AR (red). The data correspond to average ± SD of two independent
experiments.

In the absence of polymer,
both membrane compositions showed a
low level of fluctuation when dispersed in NaCl solutions because
of the suppression of the undulations that in known to occur in charged
membranes caused by the additional energy cost of undulating the Gouy–Chapman
double layer.39,40 The addition of Ca2+ increased 2.5 times the population of fluctuating anionic vesicles
because of the partial neutralization of the membrane charge by this
ion.18,19

The addition of DS to the dispersing
solution did not modify the
percent of fluctuating vesicles for GUVs composed of DOTAP/PC (Figure 8a). In this system,
the adsorption of DS on the membrane surface modifies the zeta potential
values from ∼+20 to ∼−20 mV (i.e., without changes
in the absolute value), while dH increases,
and thus probably the charge density at the slipping plane decreases.
These changes appear not to affect the thermal fluctuations or, alternatively,
the possible changes are counterbalanced by other changes promoted
by the DS coating. In this regard, the addition of DS to the cationic
liposome solution modifies the membrane thickness (as detected by
BAM) and very probably the double layer thickness because of changes
in the interfacial electrostatic properties. Both changes have been
reported to influence the bending rigidity; a decrease in the double
layer thickness or in the surface charge decreases the bending rigidity,39−46 while a membrane thickening increases this parameter.45

For PG/PC GUVs in the absence of Ca2+, Figure 8b, the polymer induces a decrease
in the population of fluctuating GUVs, suggesting an increase in the
membrane rigidity. This may be due to the increment in the effective
membrane thickness, as observed by BAM, and/or to a charge increase
at the surface as the polymer binds. In this regard, the slight shift
toward zero depicted in the zeta potential not necessarily corresponds
to a decrease in the surface charge, but it may be due to a decrease
in the thickness of the Debye length when the polymer binds to the
vesicles, as already pointed out.

In the case of the anionic
membranes in the presence of Ca2+, Figure 8c, 0.4% of DS decreased 6 times the population
of fluctuating GUVs.
This is very probably due to an increase in the surface charge of
the membrane by the anionic polymer binding, and an increase in the
effective membrane thickness is due to the formation of a PG–Ca–DS
layered structure. This is in agreement with the increase in monolayer
reflectivity, LUV’s hydrodynamic diameter, and zeta potential
experiments.

The addition of larger amounts of DS to this system
promotes an
increase in the fluctuating population, approaching the values obtained
for 0% DS. This is remarkable because a competition between DS and
PG for the bivalent ion would lead to a more negatively charged membrane,
with a lower population of fluctuating GUVs. The recovery of a highly
fluctuating population in the presence of 1% DS shows that at these
conditions the system is not simply composed of anionic PG/PC vesicles
with the Ca2+ ions sequestered by the polymer.

The
experiments shown here allowed to qualitatively test the mechanical
properties of the different bilayers in the presence of the polymer.
In order to get a more quantitative information of the bending rigidity
modulus, more detailed analysis of the contour fluctuations of GUVs
using phase-contrast video microscopy can be performed.47−49 Alternatively, the pipette aspiration technique50 and optical tweezers have been used.51

3 Discussion
Our results
indicate that DS binds to the cationic vesicles, forming
a polymer layer close to the polar head-group without incorporating
into the membrane and providing the vesicle with a negative surface
and a large hydrodynamic diameter. The DS coverage forms a loosely
packed layer, which appears not to affect membrane stability upon
the tested perturbations, nor their rigidity.

In the case of
the anionic vesicles, the affinity of the polymer
depends on the ionic composition of the milieu. Na+ and
Ca2+ are known to interact with PG/PC membranes with affinities
of 0.6 and 18.8 M–1,19,20 respectively,
leaving a partially neutralized surface. In turn, DS interacts with
both cations; with Ca2+, an apparent constant of 24.6 M–1 have been reported,21,23 while the
affinity for Na+ is lower.21,23 Therefore,
we propose that DS binding to the lipid surface occurs through a metal
ion-bridge, without penetrating the membranes.

The polymer affected
only very slightly or did not affect the tested
properties of this vesicles in the absence of Ca2+. On
the contrary, DS promoted a destabilizing effect in the presence of
the bivalent ion. We propose that this is caused by a competition
of the polymer with the lipids for Ca2+, leading to a more
loosening Ca2+/lipid structure, and thus to a less packed
lipid structure when DS is present, that resembles that in the absence
of Ca2+. Experiments performed with a high Ca2+/DS ratio support this hypothesis.

However, the shape fluctuations
of the GUVs in the presence of
excess of polymer suggest that at these conditions the system is not
simply composed of anionic PG/PC vesicles with the Ca2+ ions completely sequestered by the polymer, but that DS partially
removes the bivalent ions, leading to a less tight Ca2+/lipid interaction. Taking together all the results, we propose for
the vesicles composed of PG/PC, the structures schematized in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Scheme of the proposed
structures formed by the anionic vesicles
and DS: (a) In NaCl solutions: negatively charged vesicles with small
sizes (60 nm), rigid and sensitive to detergent addition. (b) In NaCl
+ 10 mM CaCl2 solutions: Ca2+ partially neutralizes
the membrane charge resulting in fluctuating vesicles with small sizes
(60 nm) and high resistance to detergent addition. (c) In NaCl + 10
mM CaCl2 + 0.4 w/v % SD solutions: Ca2+ ions
interact with both, DS and the membrane, the negative charge increases
and the vesicle + coverage forms a rigid and large (80 nm) structure,
which is sensitive to detergent addition. Ca2+ forms a
diffuse layer surrounding the vesicle. (d) In NaCl + 10 mM CaCl2 + 1 w/v % SD solutions: the polymer partially removes Ca2+ ions. Vesicles are of intermediate sizes (70 nm) and with
fluctuation properties between (b,c). The sensitivity against detergent
is also intermediate. (e) In NaCl + 25 mM CaCl2 + 1 w/v
% SD solutions: vesicles are large (100 nm), due to a thick layer
of polymer and Ca2+ with characteristics similar to that
in (c), where the Ca2+/DS proportion is the same, and thus,
the sensitivity against detergent is similar.

The optimal Ca2+/DS proportion for the Ca2+/DS/lipid interaction occurs at 10 mM Ca2+ and
0.4–0.6%
DS. Taking into account the reported range of molecular weights for
DS (6500–10 000 Da), 0.5% corresponds to ∼0.6
mM, that is, to a Ca2+/DS molar proportion of ∼17.
Because the average percent of sulfur in the polymer is 17%, the optimal
interaction occurs for a Ca2+/SO3– proportion of 1:2–1:3. This indicates that the negative charge
of the liposome/DS structure is not completely neutralized by the
bivalent ion.

4 Conclusions
The
experiments shown in this work aimed at analyzing the reasons
for the proposed stabilizing effects of polysaccharides on lipid vesicles
potentially useful as vehicles for drug delivery. We found that although
DS bound to the tested membranes, this interaction did not promote
changes in the stability upon the stresses proved here, nor in the
rigidity. Moreover, the stabilization promoted by Ca2+ on
PG/PC membranes was partially reverted by the addition of DS.

Our results therefore indicate that the main effect of DS on vesicles
in drug delivery systems should lay on processes occurring in vivo
and not on the physicochemical properties of the preparation. For
instance, the polysaccharide covering may promote invisibilization
effects to the immune system, which may be due to the similarity between
DS and glicasaminoglicans present in the extracellular matrix of the
cell.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
DOPC; DOPG (sodium salt);
DPPC; DOTAP (methyl sulfate salt); and the lipophilic fluorescent
probe l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine-N-(lissaminerhodamine B sulfanyl) (ammonium salt) (egg-transphosphatidylated,
chicken) (Rho-PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL). We studied two lipid mixtures, DOTAP/DPPC 1:9 and DOPG/DPPC 1:1.

DS sodium salt from Leuconostoc spp
(Mw 6500–10 000 Da, with
approximately 17% of sulfur), CF, polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether (TritonX-100), and β-casein from bovine
milk were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).

Lipid solutions
were dissolved in chloroform:methanol 2:1. All
the solvents and chemicals used were of the highest commercial purity
available. The solutions were prepared with deionized water (18 MΩ,
with an Osmoion system Apema, Argentina). NaCl and CaCl2 were purchased from Merck. Indium tin-oxide slides (ITOs) for GUV’s
formation were from Nanocs (USA).

5.2 Monolayers
at the Air–Water Interface
Compression isotherms were
performed with a KSV Langmuir balance,
using the Wilhelmy method with a platinum plate. The lipid monolayers
were formed by spreading the lipids (1 nmol/μL) on the desired
aqueous solution (pH ≈ 6 due to CO2 dissolution)
and compressed at 1 × 10–2 nm2 molecule–1 min–1. The subphase contained NaCl
145 mM in the case of DOTAP/DPPC and NaCl 15 mM or CaCl2 10 mM for DOPG/DPPC monolayers.

During compression, monolayers
were observed using BAM with an EP3 Imaging Ellipsometer (Accurion)
equipped with a 20× objective (Nikon, NA 0.35). The equipment
was calibrated with the clean interface before spreading the lipids
in order to determine the relation between the average gray-level
of the images and the reflected light intensity (Rp).25,52 The average gray-levels (±SD) were calculated from six different
regions corresponding to each phase in at least four images for each
condition using ImageJ.

5.3 Giant Unilamellar Vesicles
GUVs were
prepared by electroformation.53 The lipid
solutions (0.5 mg/mL) doped with 0.5 mol % of the fluorescent probe
Rho-PE were spread onto two ITO-coated glass slides at 45 °C
and subjected to vacuum for 2 h for solvent evaporation. Then, lipids
were resuspended in a solution of sucrose 300 mM and the desired electrolyte
at 60 °C. For vesicles composed of DOTAP/DPPC 1:9, a 145 mM NaCl
solution was used, while for DOPG/DPPC 1:1, lower salt content was
used (NaCl 15 mM) because electroformation of GUVs with large percent
of charged lipids requires low ionic strength in the aqueous phase.54

The electrodes were connected to a homemade
wave generator,55 and a low-frequency alternate-field
was applied for 1 h at 37 °C. The waveform was modulated with
an initial sine wave of 10 Hz and an amplitude from 0 to 2.6 V Vpp increasing linearly in 60 s. After that,
the amplitude was maintained at 2.6 V Vpp.

The observation chamber was treated with a 10 w/v % β-casein
solution, which prevented the GUV rupture on the glass slide. An aliquot
of the vesicle’s suspension (approximately 25 μL) was
transferred to the observation chamber containing glucose 300 mM and
the electrolyte composition of the internal solution. In order to
study the effect of the presence of Ca2+, 15 mM NaCl was
replaced by 10 mM CaCl2 in some experiments.

GUVs
were observed with a fluorescence confocal microscope (Confocal
Zeiss LSM5 Pascal) with a 63× (1.4 NA, oil immersion) objective.
At least 20 individual GUVs were observed and recorded (100 frames,
38 frames/min).

5.4 Large Unilamellar Vesicles
LUVs were
prepared by generating a uniform lipid film on the wall of a glass
tube, by solvent evaporation under an N2 flow from a chloroform/methanol
lipid solution. Final traces of solvent were removed incubating the
lipids in a high-vacuum chamber during 2 h. Then, the lipids were
resuspended in the desired aqueous solution to a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL. The suspensions were incubated in a 60 °C water
bath for 1 min, vortexed, and submitted to cold incubation for 1 min.
This procedure was repeated five times. The resulting multilamellar
vesicles were extruded 20 times through a 100 nm pore filter (Avanti)
at room temperature for the cationic mixture and at 60 °C for
the anionic mixture.

LUVs that contained CF were prepared resuspending
the lipids in 50 mM CF (pH = 8.00). At this concentration, the dye
is self-quenched. After the extruding process, free CF was removed
filtering the LUV’s solution through size-exclusion chromatography
(Sephadex G-25) with a 173 mM NaCl solution (isotonic with the LUV
interior).

Light dispersion was determined for LUVs prepared
in 145 mM NaCl
(DOTAP/DPPC 1:9) or 15 mM NaCl (DOPG/DPPC 1:1), and zeta potential
was measured in LUVs prepared in 15 mM NaCl for all LUV’s composition.

Both Nephelometry and fluorescence measurements were acquired with
a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Agilent Technologies) equipped
with a thermally controlled multicuvette holder (23 °C), setting
the wavelength slit in 5 nm and using a 2 mm path cuvette. For Nephelometry,
the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 523 nm, and for
fluorescence, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and
515 nm, respectively.

The relative turbidity and fluorescence
were measured after each
addition of detergent, and the percent of relative turbidity (% RT), eq 1, and of released CF (%
CF), eq 2, were calculated
respectively as 1   2  where the symbol
0 refers to the initial values
and i to those after each addition of the detergent.
In eq 2, Imax is the maximum fluorescence value reached, corresponding
to the highest detergent concentration.

Hydrodynamic size distributions
were determined by DLS using a
submicron particle sizer (Nicomp 380), and zeta potential determination
was performed with a nanoparticle analyzer (HORIBA SZ-100).

The stability of LUVs upon detergent addition was tested through
permeability and vesicle rupture, adding increasing volumes of TritonX-100
to the LUV’s solutions. Permeability was determined through
the fluorescence of the released CF, while vesicle rupture was followed
through turbidity measurements using Nephelometry. The diffracted
light depends on the size and amount of diffracting particles, and
therefore, a decrease in the detected light is observed upon vesicle
rupture.56
