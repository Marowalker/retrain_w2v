This paper highlights the relation
between the shape of iron oxide
(Fe3O4) particles and their magnetic sensing
ability. We synthesized Fe3O4 nanocubes and
nanospheres having tunable sizes via solvothermal and thermal decomposition
synthesis reactions, respectively, to obtain samples in which the
volumes and body diagonals/diameters were equivalent. Vibrating sample
magnetometry (VSM) data showed that the saturation magnetization (Ms) and coercivity of 100–225 nm cubic
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were, respectively, 1.4–3.0 and
1.1–8.4 times those of spherical MNPs on a same-volume and
same-body diagonal/diameter basis. The Curie temperature for the cubic
Fe3O4 MNPs for each size was also higher than
that of the corresponding spherical MNPs; furthermore, the cubic Fe3O4 MNPs were more crystalline than the corresponding
spherical MNPs. For applications relying on both higher contact area
and enhanced magnetic properties, higher-Ms Fe3O4 nanocubes offer distinct advantages
over Fe3O4 nanospheres of the same-volume or
same-body diagonal/diameter. We evaluated the sensing potential of
our synthesized MNPs using giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensing and force-induced remnant magnetization
spectroscopy (FIRMS). Preliminary data obtained by GMR sensing confirmed
that the nanocubes exhibited a distinct sensitivity advantage over
the nanospheres. Similarly, FIRMS data showed that when subjected
to the same force at the same initial concentration, a greater number
of nanocubes remained bound to the sensor surface because of higher
surface contact area. Because greater binding and higher Ms translate to stronger signal and better analytical sensitivity,
nanocubes are an attractive alternative to nanospheres in sensing
applications.

Introduction
Magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) find widespread use in biomedical
applications.1−6 Although there have been significant advances in understanding the
relation between nanoparticle structure and the corresponding magnetic
properties,7 tuning the properties of MNPs
is complicated by the interdependent influences of various factors
on magnetic properties. A recent review has summarized the parameters
(size, shape, composition, and shell–core design) that can
be modulated to tailor the properties for a particular application.8 Extensive data exist on the effects of size,9−11 composition,12−14 and core–shell design;15−17 however, efforts
to understand the effect of shape on magnetic properties are comparatively
rare and largely inconclusive.

There have been efforts to synthesize
MNPs of various shapes: ferrite
nanocubes,18−20 maghemite nanorods,21 NiFe
nanowires,22 cobalt nanodiscs,23,24 magnetite tetrapods,2 and Au–MnO
nanoflowers,25 and there is some literature
on the influence of the particle shape on magnetic properties.11,19,26−32 However, only a handful of studies,29−32 which are summarized in Table
S1 in the Supporting Information, have
focused on comparing the magnetic properties as a function
of shape using a common basis (same volume or same diameter/body
diagonal). Further, the shape of MNPs has been shown to play an important
role during particle adhesion, distribution, and internalization in
biosensing or drug delivery.33 However,
can the correlation between shape and magnetization or sensing potential
be attributed simply to geometry?

The effect of geometry on
magnetic properties has been evaluated
for drug-delivery applications;34,35 however, research that
compares nanoparticles of different shapes based on their sensing
ability is sorely lacking. Drug delivery relies on the ability of
the nanoparticles to reach the diseased cells through the circulatory
system and then adhere to those cells. Adhesion efficiency can be
maximized by controlling the size, shape, and surface functionalization
of nanoparticles.36 Using computational
modeling, Gao and co-workers noted that the tumbling motion of nanorods
as compared to the rolling motion of nanospheres and the inherent
high contact area of nanorods when they are parallel to the cell surface
contributed significantly toward enhanced contact and binding to vascular
walls.36 Multiple studies by Decuzzi, Ferrari,
and co-workers reported a higher adhesion probability for an ellipsoidal
nanoparticle because of its larger surface area available for contact
as compared to a spherical nanoparticle of the same volume.34,37,38 Recently, Ferrari and co-workers
have focused on nanoparticle design considerations that would overcome
the barriers to drug delivery and have concluded the importance of
shape in strong adhesion to facilitate drug delivery.39 We hypothesized that the advantage of more contact points
and higher binding using nonspherical geometries can be extended to
sensing applications. For sensing, the larger contact area of cubic
nanoparticles can lead to a more robust binding to a sensing platform
or cell surface. Correspondingly, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles have a higher surface area available for contact with
a planar interface as compared to spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Scheme 1), and can thus adhere more strongly to a sensing platform. The increased
adhesion should offer enhanced sensitivity and improved signal-to-noise
ratios for cubic MNPs. To take advantage of this benefit, the design
of cubic nanoparticles should ensure that the high-contact-area geometry
is retained after coating/functionalization. Separately, a recent
study that focused on retaining the cubic shape after coating the
particles with silica showed that, even after functionalization, the
advantage of the higher surface contact area could be harnessed.40

Scheme 1 Contact Area for Spherical MNPs Compared
to Cubic MNPs
Prior studies that
explored the influence of the nanoparticle shape
on magnetic properties primarily focused on particles with diameters
less than 25 nm (Table S1).29−32 Furthermore, the results from these studies showed no conclusive
evidence on which shape corresponded to optimum magnetic properties.
When comparing a set of same magnetization CoFe2O4 cubes and spheres, Song and Zhang29 attributed
lower coercivity for cubic nanoparticles to diminished surface pinning,
which is a consequence of fewer missing coordinating oxygen atoms
in the cubic nanoparticles compared to the spherical nanoparticles.
The Noh group rationalized the higher Ms in cubic nanoparticles as compared to spherical nanoparticles of
the same volume by simulating the orientations of the magnetic spin
structures using an object-oriented micromagnetic framework program.
These researchers found that the disordered spins were 4% in cubic
MNPs and 8% in spherical MNPs.41 On the
basis of these simulations, the authors hypothesized that the lower
percentage of disordered spins in 18 nm edge Zn0.4Fe2.6O4 nanocubes gave rise to a higher Ms as compared to 22 nm diameter nanospheres of equivalent
volume. An earlier study observed significantly higher blocking temperatures
(TB) for 14 nm spheres of γ-Fe2O3 as compared to 12 nm edge nanocubes of the same
composition.30 Because TB is directly proportional to the effective anisotropy
(for such small MNPs, surface anisotropy dominates the bulk anisotropy),
the authors ascribed the higher TB of
spherical nanoparticles to their larger surface disorder and higher
surface anisotropy.30 In contrast to the
results reported by the Song and Noh groups,29,41 γ-Fe2O3 nanocubes with lower surface
anisotropy showed higher coercivity but roughly the same saturation
magnetization as the spherical MNPs.30 In
separate studies, Zhen et al. observed higher saturation magnetization
(Ms) for cubic iron oxide MNPs as compared
to spherical iron oxide MNPs of the same volume and attributed the
difference to the higher crystallinity in cubic nanoparticles despite
using the same method of synthesis (thermal decomposition).31 Similarly, some researchers have noted a linear
relationship between magnetization and crystallinity, observing an
improvement in magnetic properties with higher crystallinity for lithium-,
cobalt-, zinc-, and copper-ferrite nanoparticles.42−45

On the whole, while many
studies have touted the superior magnetic
properties of cubic MNPs, the summary presented here illustrates a
lack of consensus regarding the phenomenon (or phenomena) underpinning
the superiority. To this end, the studies reported here attempt to
provide a more definitive perspective by examining two systematically
prepared series of Fe3O4 nanocubes and nanospheres
in which (1) the particle volumes and (2) the body diagonals/diameters
are equivalent. Additionally, we use high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) to evaluate
the particle crystallinity.

The size range at which MNPs are
classified as superparamagnetic,
single-domain, or multidomain depends not only on the size, but also
on the chemical composition of the nanoparticles; Fe3O4 MNPs are superparamagnetic when smaller than ∼25 nm,
single-domain at 25–80 nm, and multidomain beyond 80 nm.8,45 Most of the shape-comparative studies have been performed for MNP
sizes that fall within the superparamagnetic regime46 or at least in the single-domain regime.46 For sensing applications, however, larger nanoparticles
exhibit higher magnetization and are thus preferred for signal amplification
considerations. Consequently, for the analysis presented in this paper,
we explored the multidomain size range for the comparison of cubic
(body diagonals of 135, 150, 175, and 225 nm) and spherical (diameters
of 100, 125, 135, 150, 175, and 225 nm) Fe3O4 MNPs to focus on the effect of shape on the magnetic properties
and sensing potential of MNPs. More specifically, we chose to focus
our studies on magnetite nanoparticles in the multidomain size range
based on (1) the relative ease of synthesis of these iron oxide nanoparticles,
(2) their established utility in sensing applications, and (3) the
notable absence of a systematic comparison of the magnetic properties
of cubic and spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles,
particularly in this size regime.

Results and Discussion
Using the synthetic method reported by Kim et al.20 that afforded magnetite nanocubes having body-diagonal
lengths of 35–275 nm (∼20–160 nm side length),
we prepared oleic acid-stabilized Fe3O4 nanocubes
having body-diagonal lengths in the range 135–225 nm by controlling
the reaction time and agitation. Similarly, we modified the reaction
time and agitation in a method developed by Deng et al.47 to obtain Fe3O4 nanospheres
with diameters in the size range of 100–275 nm. Figures 1 and 2 show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the resulting
series of nanocubes and nanospheres, and the associated size distributions.
From the SEM images, we determined that the average sizes and the
relative standard deviation (SD) values for the diameters of the spherical
Fe3O4 MNPs were 100 ± 9, 135 ± 18,
150 ± 17, 175 ± 19, and 275 ± 17 nm, and those for
the body diagonals of the cubic Fe3O4 MNPs were
135 ± 12, 150 ± 14, 175 ± 19, and 225 ± 20 nm.

For particles having the same-body diagonal/diameter, nanocubes
and nanospheres of 135, 150, and 175 nm were compared. Separately,
comparison of the same-volume pairs included nanocubes of 150, 175,
and 225 nm body-diagonal lengths and nanospheres of 100, 125, and
150 nm diameters, respectively. The magnetic properties, saturation
magnetization (Ms), and coercivity (H) were obtained for each sample using vibrating sample
magnetometry (VSM). Both shapes exhibited ferrimagnetic behavior.
We have summarized the saturation magnetization and coercivity data
for the synthesized nanocubes and nanospheres in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 highlight a
comparison of the properties on a same-volume and same-body diagonal/diameter
basis. For nanospheres in the 100–275 nm size range, the average Ms of the particles was 60 ± 15 emu/g. However,
nanocubes in the 125–225 nm size range displayed an average Ms of 90 ± 7 emu/g. Overall, cubic Fe3O4 MNPs showed higher saturation and coercivity
values than matched spherical Fe3O4 MNPs.

We further characterized these nanoparticles using
TEM. Figure 3 shows
images of
a representative pair of same-volume MNPs and a representative pair
of same-body diagonal/diameter MNPs. The images reveal that the nanocubes
(a,c) are highly crystalline and the nanospheres (b,d) are polycrystalline.

(b) 100 nm spherical Fe3O4 MNPs, (c) 135 nm
cubic Fe3O4 MNPs, and (d) 135 nm spherical Fe3O4 MNPs.

To develop quantitative data for the degree of crystallinity
for
these samples, we evaluated and compared the XRD patterns of the cubic
and spherical Fe3O4 MNPs. Figure 4 shows that the cubic MNPs exhibited much
sharper peaks as compared to the broad peaks associated with the spherical
MNPs. To evaluate the crystallinity of the MNPs on a quantitative
basis, we calculated the crystallite size. This parameter is inversely
proportional to the peak width based upon Scherrer’s formula,
as shown in eq 1.48 1  where K = shape factor. λ
= wavelength (0.154 nm). β = line broadening at 1/2 the maximum
intensity (rad). θ = Bragg angle.

The broad peaks of the
spherical MNPs as compared to the sharp
peaks for the cubic MNPs indicate that the crystallite size of the
cubic sample is larger. We calculated the crystallinity index (CI)
value for the nanocubes and nanospheres using eq 2.49 2  

Table 4 lists the
crystallite size and the CI of one representative pair each of the
same-volume and same-body diagonal/diameter Fe3O4 MNPs. We provide additional data for a wide range of crystallite
sizes as the Supporting Information (see
Table S2). Please note that a lower CI value by definition corresponds
to a higher degree of crystallinity (i.e., a CI of 1 indicates a crystal
that is completely monocrystalline).49 On
the whole, the XRD data complement the TEM images, where results of
both analyses show that cubic Fe3O4 MNPs had
a higher degree of crystallinity as compared to spherical Fe3O4 MNPs.

We propose that the higher
saturation magnetization observed for
the nanocubes (see Tables 1–3) is due to their greater
crystallinity. Previous studies have shown that the high crystallite
size in nanocubes leads to high saturation magnetization because of
reduced surface spin disorder.13,31,50 Liu et al. varied the crystal size and showed that for polycrystalline
nanospheres less than 250 nm in size, the saturation magnetization
depends on both the diameter and its crystal size (and hence crystallinity).50 As expected,50,51 owing to the
higher crystal size in the multidomain MNPs, the saturation magnetization
of Fe3O4 nanocubes is higher than that of nanospheres
(Tables 1–3).

To compare the magnetic properties of nanocubes
and nanospheres
on the basis of same crystallinity, we attempted to generate spherical
MNPs (>100 nm) with a higher degree of crystallinity by varying
the
surfactant (oleic acid) concentration using the solvothermal method
and by carrying out liquid reduction synthesis at higher temperatures
(up to 290 °C). However, these efforts have thus far been unsuccessful.
Additionally, we measured the Curie temperature (TC) of these spherical and cubic MNPs, and the results
are shown in Figure 5. In the size range studied, the overall TC for cubic MNPs is greater than that of spherical MNPs. The Curie
temperature identifies the transition point from ferrimagnetic (in
case of Fe3O4 MNPs) to paramagnetic. Because
the Curie temperature for both types of our MNPs is quite high (780–840
K range), our data simply serve as another parameter of comparison.

same diameter/body diagonal spherical/cubic MNPs and (b) Curie temperatures
of spherical and cubic nanoparticles as a function of size.

After characterizing the MNPs
(cubic and spherical), we evaluated
the potential use of these MNPs in a sensing application and investigated
their response using giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensing and force-induced
remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS). We compared the effectiveness
of cubic and spherical MNPs as reporters of biomolecular agents (targets)
using our in-house-built GMR biosensor. Since its first report by
Baselt et al.,52 several groups have continued
the research and development of magnetic biosensing technology.53−61 The biodetection scheme employs MNPs as reporters of biological
agents, which are detected using a magnetoresistive element, where
the resistance of the magnetoresistive sensor changes in the presence
of MNPs. The GMR effect is the consequence of spin-polarized electron
transport in GMR multilayer structures such as the Co/Cu/Co multilayers
used in this work.62−66 The resistance of GMR magnetic field sensors depends on the mutual
orientation of Co magnetic layers in the Co/Cu/Co multilayer. When
the magnetization directions of the ferromagnetic Co layers are aligned
in the same direction, the structure/sensor is in its low resistance
state. When the magnetization of the Co layers is antiparallel, the
sensor exhibits high resistance.

A GMR sensor detects stray
fields generated by MNPs placed in the
vicinity of the sensor. Experimentally, the presence of MNPs is manifested
by the modification of the dependence of the sensor resistance on
the applied external magnetic field as shown in Figure 6. Because of the hysteretic behavior of the
material, there are two high-resistance states, both symmetrically
offset from zero. The positions of the resistance maxima (peaks) in
these GMR curves shift in the presence of MNPs. Δx is estimated as the difference in peak-to-peak distance in the absence
and presence of MNPs. Here, approximately 4.9 × 1010 MNPs were deposited on the GMR sensor, and the change in peak-to-peak
distance (Δx) was recorded. Figure 6 shows the magnetoresistance
curve (and Δx) of 135 nm cubic Fe3O4 MNPs on one representative sensor, illustrating the
dependence of the GMR sensor resistance on the magnetic field in the
absence and presence of MNPs.

Figure 6 Plot of a typical response of a GMR sensor in
the absence and presence
of MNPs. The arrows indicate the corresponding magnetization states.67 The representative data shown are for 135 nm
cubic Fe3O4 on one sensor.

For cubic MNPs, Δx was ∼18
±
9 Oe and was observed to be higher than the ∼4 ± 4 Oe
obtained for spherical MNPs of the same volume. Data from five sensors
were used to calculate the average in each case. The experiment was
carried out with the same particle count for both cubic and spherical
MNPs (see the Experimental Section), and although
it is likely that the cubic shape improves sensor surface contact,
we were unable to determine quantitatively the relative coverage on
each sensor.

To highlight the advantage of a higher contact
area and overcome
the concern of nonspecific binding, we functionalized these nanoparticles
with biotin and used the FIRMS technique to demonstrate how strongly
these particles bind to the streptavidin-functionalized surface when
subjected to varying centrifugal forces.68,69 Notably, FIRMS uses an atomic magnetometer to measure the magnetization
of ligand-conjugated magnetic particles as a function of an external
force. In this study, biotin serves as the molecule to be detected
and is the ligand attached to the MNPs. When the biotin-functionalized
MNPs come in contact with the streptavidin-conjugated surface, the
MNPs bind to the surface. When force is applied, the nonspecifically
bound MNPs are removed from the surface. In the FIRMS technique employed
here, the unbound nanoparticles are removed from the surface at high
centrifuge speeds (strong centrifugal force).

Figure 7 shows the
FIRMS results for biotin-functionalized particles on the streptavidin
surface. The magnetization on the y-axis reflects
the number of nanoparticles that are present on the surface. At strong
(1 pN) forces, the magnetization response of the nanocubes that remained
on the surface was higher than that of the same-volume nanospheres
(see Figures 7a and 7b). The difference of the magnetic response on the
streptavidin surfaces can be explained by comparing the (1) magnetic
strength of nanocubes to that of nanospheres and (2) the surface area
of nanocubes to that of nanospheres. Figure S1 shows the magnetic calibration curves versus the mass concentration,
measured using an atomic magnetometer. The magnetic calibration curves
based on the same mass for the same volume of MNPs display a linear
trend, where nanocubes show higher magnetic strength than nanospheres.
The y-axis in Figure 7b reflects the number of nanoparticles present on the
surface (Figure 7b)
and shows that there are more cubic MNPs on the surface as indicated
by the higher magnetic signal (Figure 7a) compared to that of the spherical MNPs. The data
demonstrate that on applying the same force, a smaller number of nanocubes
(as compared to the nanospheres) were detached from the sensor surface.
This preliminary study thereby validates our hypothesis that nanocubes
provide a stronger binding to the sensor surface than that afforded
by nanospheres.

for nanocubes and nanospheres of 135 nm [side length (side), body
diagonal (bd), and diameter (d)] and (d) number of particles on the
sensor after centrifugation at 7245g centrifugal
force. Initial numbers of particles are stated in the text.

We then used nanocubes and nanospheres
with dissimilar volumes
so we could compare the effect of applying the same centrifugal force
to them (see Figures 7c and 7d). We compared three samples: (1)
nanocubes with 135 nm side lengths, (2) nanocubes with 135 nm body-diagonal
lengths, and (3) nanospheres with 135 nm diameters. Using FIRMS, we
demonstrated that compared to nanospheres (135 nm diameter), a higher
number of nanocubes (135 nm bd) remained on the surface, giving a
higher signal after 7245g of centrifugal force. The
higher magnetization and smaller mass of each 135 nm bd nanocube (and
consequently, a higher number of these nanocubes as compared to 135
nm diameter nanospheres) can plausibly contribute to the higher magnetic
response from the streptavidin-modified surface. We know that the
centrifugal force experienced by any nanoparticle is directly proportional
to its mass. Therefore, we further compared the 135 nm diameter nanospheres
with the 135 nm side length nanocubes, which have higher volume and
mass. The higher mass (10 fg) of each 135 nm side length nanocube
as compared to each 135 nm diameter nanosphere (5 fg) corresponded
to a lower number of cubic MNPs even though the total mass of the
cubic and spherical MNP powder deposited on the surface was the same.
Consequently, at the same rpm, the higher-volume (and higher-mass)
nanocubes experienced a higher centrifugal force. Despite the relatively
higher force experienced by the 135 nm side length nanocubes and their
lower initial concentration (3.4 × 108 for 135 nm
side length cubic, 1.6 × 109 for 135 nm body-diagonal
length cubic, and 5.8 × 108 for spherical), compared
to nanospheres, more 135 nm side length nanocubes remained on the
surface after application of a force corresponding to 7245g (0.6 pN for 135 side length nanocubes, 0.1 pN for 135
nm body length diagonal nanocubes, and 0.4 pN for nanospheres). Figure 7d demonstrates that
at 7245g centrifugal force (equivalent to 9000 rpm),
the number of nanocubes (2.1 × 108) after removing
nonspecific binding was almost three times as that of the nanospheres
(0.7 × 108), even though the force experienced by
each nanocube is almost twice that by each nanosphere. Both these
studies unequivocally demonstrate that, because of their robust binding
based on the higher contact area, the nanocubes require a much stronger
force to break them away from the surface as compared to the nanospheres.

We have demonstrated that at a same-volume and a same-body diagonal/diameter
basis, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit a higher
magnetization and coercivity than their spherical counterparts in
the 100–225 nm size range. The higher contact area of the nanocubes
led to stronger attachment to the surface, which was demonstrated
using FIRMS in all comparison studies (same volume, same-body diagonal/diameter,
and same side length/diameter). We quantitatively showed that even
when the initial number of (135 nm side length) nanocubes was an order
of magnitude lower than that of (135 nm diameter) nanospheres, and
force applied for nanocubes was 1.5 times that for nanospheres, a
higher number of nanocubes remained on the surface, thus illustrating
stronger binding and sensitivity potential of the nanocubes compared
to the nanospheres. The enhanced magnetic properties and potentially
higher sensing sensitivity of the nanocubes, as compared to the nanospheres,
make nanocubes an attractive alternative to nanospheres in sensing
applications.

Conclusions
The studies reported
here allow us to conclude that, for sensing
applications that rely on either a higher contact area or higher magnetization,
higher crystallinity Fe3O4 nanocubes offer distinct
advantages over polycrystalline Fe3O4 nanospheres
of the same-volume or same-length diagonal or side length/diameter
because of (1) stronger binding of nanocubes to substrate surfaces
because of their greater contact area and (2) enhanced magnetic properties
of the nanocubes due to their greater crystallinity in the multidomain
size regime. Further work on synthesis of monocrystalline Fe3O4 spheres in this size regime (>80 nm diameter) is
ongoing
and will further delineate the relationships between nanoparticle
shape, crystallinity, and magnetic properties.

Nanoparticle
Synthesis
We varied the reaction parameters
in a modified thermal decomposition reaction20,70 process and liquid-phase reduction process47 to generate distinct sizes of Fe3O4 nanocubes
and nanospheres. The chemicals used in the syntheses described below
were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.
Millipore water (resistivity higher than 18 MΩ cm) was used
in the synthesis and washing steps.

Cubic Fe3O4 Synthesis
Using a
variation of a known thermal decomposition method,20,70 we synthesized Fe3O4 nanocubes with body-diagonal
lengths of 135, 150, 175, and 225 nm (edge lengths 80, 85, 100, and
130 nm, respectively). Iron acetylacetonate [Fe(acac)3]
and oleic acid were heated to 290 °C in benzyl ether as a solvent
and stirred in a round-bottomed flask using a magnetic stirrer. After
30 min, a black precipitate was obtained, which was washed multiple
times with ethanol and dried under vacuum at room temperature. By
varying the reactant concentration and reaction time, Fe3O4 nanocubes with tunable body-diagonal lengths were obtained.

Spherical Fe3O4 Synthesis
Our
modified recipe of the procedure reported by Deng et al.47 yielded spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles with diameters of 100, 125, 135, 150, 175, and 275
nm. The procedure involved charging a round-bottomed flask with iron
chloride (1.4 g, FeCl3·6H2O) and 15 mL
of ethylene glycol, followed sequentially by the addition of sodium
acetate (3.6 g). The addition of sodium acetate rapidly turned the
orange FeCl3·6H2O solution to a brown color.
The solution was stirred for an additional 30 min and then injected
at once into a round-bottomed flask containing a vigorously stirred
solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.40 g) in 35 mL of ethylene glycol
heated to 180 °C. This mixture was then vigorously stirred at
180 °C for 4–24 h during which a black precipitate was
obtained. The black precipitate was alternately washed multiple times
with ethanol and Milli-Q water and dried under vacuum at room temperature.
Agitation (stirrer speed), temperature, and reaction time were the
process parameters that were varied to obtain Fe3O4 nanospheres of diameters that either matched the body diagonals
of the synthesized nanocubes or had the same volume as that of the
synthesized nanocubes.

Characterization
The nanoparticles
were characterized
by TEM (JEOL-2000 FX operating at 200 kV with attached energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy), SEM (LEO-1525 operating at 15 kV), and XRD (Siemens
D5000 X-ray diffractometer). For the TEM analyses, the nanoparticles
were deposited on a 300-mesh holey carbon-coated copper grid and allowed
to dry; for the SEM analyses, the nanoparticles were deposited on
a silicon wafer and allowed to dry. The size distribution for each
sample was generated by analysis of 50–60 nanoparticles. We
used XRD for compositional and crystal structure confirmation. For
analysis by XRD, a concentrated sample in ethanol was deposited on
a piranha-cleaned glass slide, with XRD being carried out using Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 1.540562 Å) at the 2θ range
from 0° to 90°. In addition to imaging, TEM was also used
to obtain diffraction patterns to obtain the crystallinity and compositional
purity of the sample. The magnetic properties (saturation magnetization,
residual magnetization, and coercivity) of a known mass of the sample
were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (LakeShore VSM
7300 Series with LakeShore 735 Controller and LakeShore 450 Gaussmeter;
Software Version 3.8.0). The Curie temperature data were obtained
using VSM with varying-temperature capability (VSM PPMS EverCool II,
Quantum Design, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Preliminary Experiments
Using a GMR Sensor
A basic
giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor usually includes ferromagnetic
layers interspersed with nonferromagnetic layers, and an antiferromagnetic
exchange coupling generates the alternating opposing magnetization
required for the GMR effect.71 The magnetoresistance-based
sensor (2 μm × 1.5 μm) used for our study consists
of layers of Co/Cu/Co that are coated with alumina or silica. Aliquots
of nanoparticles (same numbers of particles for each shape) were deposited
on the sensors, which were then detected by a corresponding change
in peak-to-peak distance (Δx as shown in Figure 6) on the plot of
resistance versus field. In our preliminary experiments, we deposited
0.25 mL of 1 mg/mL (that is, the same number of same-volume cubic
and spherical MNPs) on each sensor and noted the change in the peak-to-peak
distance for each sample on each sensor. Additional details of sensor
(production and SEM images) are supplied in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

Preliminary Experiments
Using FIRMS
In the FIRMS technique,
a change in the magnetic signal is measured as a function of increasing
mechanical force and was used to differentiate between the binding
of the cubic and spherical MNPs to the sensor surface.68 The MNPs were functionalized with biotin; the
sensor surface was functionalized with streptavidin. Biotin-functionalized
MNPs were well-dispersed in PBS buffer by shaker and incubated with
the streptavidin-modified surface in a sample well for 2 h. Samples
were magnetized by the application of a permanent magnet perpendicularly
for 2 min at ∼0.5 T magnetic field before measurement. A mechanical
force was applied to distinguish nonspecific versus specific ligand–receptor
binding. A reduced magnetic signal due to the Brownian motion of the
dissociated MNPs was used to randomize the magnetic dipoles. The remnant
signal indicated the specific biotin–streptavidin binding.
Measurements of the magnetic signals of the sample were obtained using
an atomic magnetometer home-built in the Xu group.72 The magnetic field generated from the MNPs was measured
by the atomic magnetometer having a noise level of ∼1–2
pT in this work. The MNPs were allowed to bind to the surface and
then subjected to centrifugation (centrifugal force), which removed
unbound cubic and spherical MNPs from the surface. The functionalization
of the MNPs and the sensor surface is described below.

Preparation
of Biotin-Modified Magnetic Particles
To
functionalize the magnetic particles with amino groups, the MNPs (0.003
g) were dispersed in 30 mL of ethanol solution in a 50 mL round-bottomed
flask and sonicated for at least 30 min. To the well-dispersed MNP
solution, we added 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (0.2 mL) and then
mechanically stirred the mixture overnight. The resulting particles
were washed with ethanol and collected using centrifuge and magnetic
separation several times. The amino-functionalized MNPs (0.5 mg) were
dispersed in 300 μL of PBS buffer in a small glass vial for
sonication (15 min). A mixture of 1.5 mg/100 μL biotin-PEG-SVA
and 2 mg/100 μL mPEG-SVA was injected into the MNP dispersion.
The reaction vial was shaken at 600 rpm for 4 h. The biotin-conjugated
nanoparticles were washed with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and isolated by
magnetic separation several times, and then re-dispersed in PBS buffer
with NaN3 (0.2 w/w %).

Preparation of Streptavidin-Modified
Surfaces
The streptavidin
surfaces were prepared via layer-by-layer construction, which included
an amino-functionalized layer, a biotinylated coating, and an outer
streptavidin-terminated layer. One amino-functionalized slide was
incubated with a mixture containing biotin-PEG-succinimidyl valerate
and mPEG-succinimidyl valerate for 3 h. After biotinylation, all slides
were rinsed with water and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The
sample well was assembled by gluing the functionalized glass to a
20 × 3 × 1 mm3 (L × W × H) piece of polystyrene having
a 4 mm × 2 mm oval opening at the center (area ≈ 7 mm2). The streptavidin surface was prepared through the conjugation
between streptavidin and the biotin-modified surface, which was carried
out by adding 8 μL of 0.625 mg/mL streptavidin into a sample
well functionalized with biotin followed by incubation for 1 h.
