A new method for
the stereoselective synthesis of tetrasubstituted
olefins is described. β-Ketophosphonates are alkylated via conventional
methods, and a Grignard reagent is used to diastereoselectively add
to the carbonyl group of the resulting intermediates. The elimination
of hydroxyl phosphonates yielded the desired tetrasubstituted olefins
in a stereoselective manner. Thus, homofarnesenes of fire ant trail
pheromones have been synthesized efficiently using this strategy.

Introduction
Tetrasubstituted olefins
are present in certain natural products, for instance,
the trail pheromones of fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren isolated in 1959,1 two structures
of which were established in 19812 to be
homofarnesenes (Figure 1a,b). However, Alvarez3 et al. synthesized
these two homofarnesenes in 1987 from geranyl bromide in five steps
as a 1:2 (ZE/EE) mixture using Wittig
olefination as a key reaction. Chou and Lee4 reported in 1990 the synthesis in four steps using 3-sulfolene as
a key building block as a 1:1.1 mixture. However, high performance
liquid chromatography was used to separate components of the reaction
mixture. Mateos5 et al. stereoselectively
synthesized homofarnesene 1a in two steps using Cu/Pd-catalyzed
allylboration as a key reaction.

Figure 1 Structures of homofarnesenes 1a and 1b.

The stereoselective synthesis of tetrasubstituted olefins
has been
a challenge to the synthetic community.6 Conventional methods of the preparation of tetrasubstituted olefins
include the Wittig olefination7 and the
Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction.8 Less often used reactions are decomposition of diazo compounds9 or extrusion of sulfur dioxide.10 However, these methods are usually not stereoselective.
Inspired by the findings reported by Reichwein and Pagenkopf11 that β-hydroxy phosphonates produce olefins
stereospecifically upon treatment with a dehydrating agent, we envisioned
that the construction of tetrasubstituted olefins may also be feasible
if the formation of the relevant stereochemical centers of the β-hydroxy
phosphonate is under control. In this article, we report a stereoselective
synthesis of homofarnesenes (1a and 1b)
through the establishment of an efficient method for the preparation
of tetrasubstituted acyclic olefins.

Results and Discussion
Our synthetic strategy of these two homofarnesenes is outlined
in Scheme 1. Homofarnesene 1a may be synthesized from aldehyde 5 through
a Wittig reaction. Aldehyde 5 may be obtained from the
elimination of β-hydroxy phosphonate 4,10 which may be produced from α-ketophosphonate 3 through a diastereoselective addition of a methyl Grignard
reagent, whereas the formation of 3 may be accomplished
via a two-step continuous alkylation of 2.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic
Analysis of Homofarnesenes
Homofarnesene 1b may be synthesized from
the elimination
of β-hydroxy phosphonate 7,11 which may be obtained from phosphonate 6 after
a diastereoselective addition of the vinyl Grignard reagent. The preparation
of phosphonate 6 is straightforward.

Synthesis
of homofarnesene 1a is described in Scheme 2. Protection of the
hydroxyl group of methyl glycolate with tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane/Et3N/dimethylaminopyridine yielded ester 8.12 Treatment of dimethyl methylphosphonate with n-BuLi followed by addition of ester 8 afforded 9 in 74% yield.13 Alkylation of
phosphonate 9 with geranyl chloride under the action
of NaH/NaI/N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) furnished 11 in 85% yield, which, after reaction
with CH3I/NaH, produced 12 in 95% yield. When
treated with methyl magnesium chloride, phosphonate 12 gave 13 in 94% yield.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Homofarnesene 1a
Removal of the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl group of 13 with 1.1
equiv of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran
provided 14 in 70% yield. β-Hydroxy phosphonate 14 was hydrolyzed with NaOH in H2O/MeOH and then
treated with dichloromethane (DIC) in CHCl3 to form alcohol 15 in 70% overall yield.11 After
a Dess–Martin oxidation, intermediate 5 was obtained
in 86% yield. Finally, the desired homofarnesene 1a(3) was obtained when treated with the methylene
Wittig reagent furnished in 81% yield (ZE/EE = 7.5:1).

The diastereoselectivity is presumably
governed by a chelation
control as is shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Possible Mechanism for the Origin of the Diastereoselectivity14,15
The synthesis of homofarnesene 1b is described in Scheme 4. Phosphonate 16 was alkylated by geranyl
chloride under the action of NaH/DMF
(58%). Phosphonate 17 was treated with vinylmagnesium
bromide to give 7 in 88% yield. As shown in Scheme 3, chelation is also
operative in this case. β-Hydroxy phosphonate 7 was hydrolyzed by NaOH in H2O/MeOH and then treated with
DIC in CHCl3 to form the desired homofarnesene 1b (EE/ZE = 8:1) in 73% overall yield.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Homofarnesene 1b
Scheme 5 Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) of Homofarnesenes 1a and 1b
The geometric configuration of the two homofarnesenes
was established
on the basis of the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectrum
(see Supporting Information). In 1a, Ha is in close proximity to Hb and
they produced a NOE, but it was not observed in 1b. In
the structure of 1b, Ha is in close proximity
to Hc and a NOE was observed (Scheme 5). The ratio of the two homofarnesenes was
determined via the integration of the protons.

Conclusions
In
summary, two homofarnesenes have been synthesized in a highly
stereoselective manner. In addition, during the synthesis, a very
useful method for the highly stereoselective construction of acyclic
tetrasubstituted olefins has been developed.

(2Z,5E)-2,3,6,10-Tetramethylundeca-2,5,9-trien-1-ol
(15)
A solution of dimethyl (E)-(1,2-dihydroxy-2,3,6,10-tetramethylundeca-5,9-dien-3-yl)phosphonate
(14) (600 mg, 1.72 mmol) in methanol (8 mL) was stirred
at room temperature before aqueous sodium hydroxide (4 mol/L, 8 mL,
32 mmol) was slowly added. The mixture was stirred for 16 h before
hydrochloric acid (2 mol/L) was slowly added to the reaction mixture
to adjust the solution to pH 2. The aqueous phase was extracted with
dichloromethane (6 × 20 mL), and the extracts were combined with
the organic phase. After the dichloromethane solution was dried over
MgSO4, the drying agent was filtered off and the solution
was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in chloroform
(8 mL), and the solution was stirred at room temperature before N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.53 mL, 3.44
mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h before it
was concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatography of the residue on
silica gel (20 g, hexanes/EtOAc = 1:1 to 1:5 v/v) afforded alcohol 15 (202 mg, 0.91 mmol, 53% yield) as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 5.12–4.99
(m, 2H), 4.13 (s, 2H), 2.81 (d, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H),

(2Z,5E)-2,3,6,10-Tetramethylundeca-2,5,9-trienal
(5)
A solution of (2Z,5E)-2,3,6,10-tetramethylundeca-2,5,9-trien-1-ol (15) (100 mg, 0.45 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane (5 mL) was stirred
at room temperature before Dess–Martin periodinane (380 mg,
0.9 mmol) was added. After 20 min, saturated sodium bicarbonate (5
mL) and saturated sodium thiosulfate (5 mL) were added. The organic
phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane
(3 × 10 mL). The extracts were combined with the organic phase.
After the dichloromethane solution was dried over MgSO4, the drying agent was filtered off and the solution was concentrated
in vacuo. Flash chromatography of the residue on silica gel (3 g,
hexanes/EtOAc = 10:1) afforded aldehyde 5 (85 mg, 0.386
mmol, 86% yield) as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 10.14 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 1H),
5.06 (q, J = 6.6 Hz, 2H), 3.29 (d, J = 7.1 Hz, 1.77H), 2.97 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 0.27H),

3H), 1.59 (s, 3H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3)
δ (ppm) 190.86, 158.07, 137.57, 132.17, 131.64, 123.90, 120.87,
39.64, 31.57, 26.48, 25.68, 21.53, 17.67, 16.30, 10.94. ESI-HRMS (m/z) [M + H]+ calculated for
C15H25O 221.1827; found 221.1814.

(3Z,6E)-3,4,7,11-Tetramethyldodeca-1,3,6,10-tetraene
(1a)
A solution of n-BuLi in
anhydrous hexane (0.5 mL, 0.8 mmol) was added to a solution of methyltriphenylphosphonium
bromide in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL), and the resulting solution
was cooled to −15 °C and stirred for 5 min before it was
warmed up to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. A solution of (2Z,5E)-2,3,6,10-tetramethylundeca-2,5,9-trienal
(5) (67 mg, 0.3 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (1
mL) was slowly added via a syringe, and the reaction mixture was heated
under reflux. After 1.5 h, saturated ammonium chloride (5 mL) was
added. The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was
extracted with n-pentane (3 × 5 mL). The extracts
were combined with the organic phase. After the n-pentane solution was dried over MgSO4, the drying agent
was filtered off and the solution was concentrated in vacuo. Flash
chromatography of the residue on silica gel (3 g, n-pentane) afforded homofarnesene 1a (ZE/EE = 7.5:1) (53 mg, 0.243 mmol, 81% yield) as a
colorless oil. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO) δ (ppm) 6.94–6.79
