Inspired by the remarkable
adhesion of mussels, the mimicking of
natural adhesive molecules has been widely used for surface modification.
In the present study, an economical and easily available biomimic
material named as tannic acid–Fe3+ (TA–Fe3+) was first directly used as a surface modifier, carbonization
agent, smoke inhibitor, and flame-retardant synergist. Compared with
the flame-retardant magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), TA–Fe3+-modified Mg(OH)2 endowed polyamide 6 (PA 6) with
improved mechanical performance and flame-retardant properties. The
flame-retardant and smoke-suppressant properties were tested by the
limiting oxygen index and cone calorimeter tests. The flame-retardation
mechanism was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning
electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The tensile
strength could increase up to 90%, and the modified flame retardant
was found to have higher UL-94 grade with the same dosage of flame-retardant
additives. The peak heat release rate, total heat release, peak of
smoke production rate, and total smoke production were significantly
reduced. The synergistic effect between TA–Fe3+ and
Mg(OH)2 was also discussed. This study provides new insights
into the direct utilization of a biomimicking adhesive molecule, TA–Fe3+, to realize simultaneous composite reinforcement and flame-retardant
property enhancement. Meanwhile, because of the extensive synergies
of flame-retardant metal oxide with iron element and the universal
growth characteristics of TA–Fe3+, it has potential
applications in the preparation of various flame-retardant polymers.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polyamide
6 (PA 6) has received considerable attention in recent
years because of its excellent mechanical properties, self-lubrication,
abrasion resistance, electrical properties, and chemical corrosion
resistance. Thus, PA 6 is extensively used in automotive, marine,
electronic appliances, industrial machinery, and consumer goods markets.1 However, the applications of PA 6 have been restricted
because of its poor flame retardancy.2 Considering
green and environmental awareness, the inorganic series of flame retardants,
such as metal hydroxides, which are nontoxic, efficient, and smokeless,
have gained popularity across the world.3 However, metal hydroxide particles are extremely easy to aggregate
because of the strong polarity of the molecules, which results in
poor adhesion between the interface of metal hydroxide and the polymer
matrix.4 The poor homogeneous dispersion
of metal hydroxide particles in the polymer matrix results in a decrease
in the mechanical properties.5 Further,
a large amount of metal hydroxide is added to the polymer matrix,
more than 50 wt %, which can also have a significant influence on
the processing performance and mechanical properties of the resulting
materials.6 Therefore, to improve the mechanical
performance and flame-retardant properties simultaneously, developing
a high-efficient synergist via reasonable compounding and surface
modification becomes one of the most important problems in polymer
and materials science.

Recently, mussels have aroused intensive
interest because of their
strong adhesive abilities resulting from their foot protein.7,8 Researchers show that catechol and amino groups in the foot protein
play a key role in the adhesion process.9,10 Lee and Messersmith
selected dopamine as a bioinspired adhesive molecule and employed
polydopamine (PDA) coatings as a general method for surface modification.11 Up to now, PDA has been widely applied in the
preparation of adhesives,12 inorganic mineralization,13 membrane separation,14 wettability,15 bioactivity,16 and antibacterial surfaces.17 Recently, Li et al.18 used PDA
as a surface-reacted layer to prepare ultrafine Fe(OH)3 on PDA coatings and a high-effective flame-retardant synergy was
obtained. However, the high cost of PDA limits its application in
the industry. Now, scientists and researchers are attempting to explore
lower-cost materials with similar properties, such as the tannic acid–iron
complexes (TA–Fe3+)19 and polyamine–catechol compounds.20

TA–Fe3+ complexes have potential applications
in the industry because of their low cost, their convenience in preparation,
and their ability to form the modification coating on the material
surface via chelation quickly. The use of TA–Fe3+ for surface modification can result in the iron ion to be dispersed
at the atomic level.21 It is noteworthy
that the iron salt is often used as a fire-retardant and smoke-suppression
agent individually or as part of a broader system.22 By virtue of these advantages, rational utilization of
biomussel-inspired TA–Fe3+ and a metal hydroxide
flame retardant to obtain a high-performance flame-retardant material
was inspiring. TA–Fe3+ and the metal hydroxide in
their combined state were applied in a combustible PA 6 material for
the first time in this work.

The flame-retardant properties
were investigated by using the limiting
oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning tests, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and cone calorimeter testing (CCT). Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic
analysis were employed to observe the morphology and structure of
char residues by PA 6 composites after combustion. Finally, the role
of TA–Fe3+ in the system was also discussed.

In the current study, Mg(OH)2 has been chosen as the
metal hydroxide flame retardant and PA 6 is used as the matrix. Surprisingly,
TA–Fe3+-modified coating not only improved the mechanical
property but also increased the flame-retardant effect, resulting
in multiple effects working together to obtain better comprehensive
performance. Further analysis was carried out for studying the mechanical
and film-retardant properties. Besides, SEM and FT-IR spectroscopy
were employed to study the morphology and structure of char residues
by PA 6 composites after combustion.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Characterization of the
PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 Compound
Imitation mussel materials
have been widely used for surface modification because of their universal
strong adhesion characteristics. In this study, TA–iron, a
cheap and broadly available imitation mussel material, grew on the
surface of Mg(OH)2, and through mixing, extrusion, granulation,
and injection with PA 6 matrix, a series of composite materials were
prepared. The schematic of the prepared structure is shown in Figure 1. TA–Fe3+ could be evenly distributed on the surface of Mg(OH)2 because of the strong hydrogen-bonding interaction between
the hydroxyl of TA and PA 6. The 200 mesh-sized Mg(OH)2 showed micron-sized particles and there was almost no change seen
after TA–Fe3+ modification (Figure S1). The coordination constant of TA–Fe3+ was lg K = 24.6 in 0.1 M NaCl solution
at 20 °C,24 which demonstrated the
reliable stability of the chelate. The crystalline structure of Mg(OH)2 had no obvious change after the TA–Fe3+ modification (Figure S2). The FT-IR spectra
of pristine Mg(OH)2, TA–Fe3+, and TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 are illustrated in Figure 2a. The strong absorption peak at 3700 cm–1 was due to the stretching vibration caused by O–H
bond in the crystals.25 The peaks in 1307
and 1177 cm–1 were assigned to the aromatic C–O
asymmetrical stretch,25 which demonstrated
the presence of TA. Mg(OH)2 is an ionic compound and has
strong molecular polarity which is not favorable for its dispersion
in PA 6. The contact angle of 0° was found for Mg(OH)2 indicating hydrophilicity. However, the contact angle was found
to be 20° after it was modified with TA–Fe3+, which proved that the modification process overshadowed the molecular
polarity of Mg(OH)2. The modified material also exhibited
hydrophilicity, which was beneficial to dispersion.

of a water droplet on (b) initial and (c) modified Mg(OH)2.

The TGA curve of TA–Fe3+ is depicted in Figure 3. It could be seen
that TA–Fe3+ had only about 12 wt % loss at 280
°C, which was due to the dehydration of TA and elimination of
TA.26 The major degradation of TA–Fe3+ occurred at around 400 °C, whereas the main decomposition
of TA occurred at 350 °C, which was consistent with the literature.26 In comparison, the decomposition temperature
of the complex slightly increased, which indicated better thermal
stability of TA–Fe3+ than that of TA. The processing
temperature of the composite material was 220 °C at which the
structural stability and chemical properties of TA–Fe3+ could be definite. In the processing via the single-screw extruder,
shear forces led to higher temperatures, which might have influenced
the stability and chemical properties of TA–Fe3+. Therefore, FT-IR spectroscopy analysis for the TA–Fe3+ complex heated at 220, 250, and 280 °C in the air was
conducted.

As shown in Figure 4, the curves of TA–Fe3+ after the heat treatment
at 220, 250, and 280 °C went through slight changes, such as
H bonding at 3325 cm–1, C=O stretching vibration
at 1680 cm–1, aromatic C–O symmetric stretching
vibration at 1590 cm–1, aromatic C–O asymmetric
stretching vibration at 1338 and 1187 cm–1, C–O–C
stretching vibration at 1020 cm–1, and C–H
out-of-plane bending at 750 cm–1. The above results
did not reveal any obvious changes in the chemical structure of the
TA–Fe3+ complex after heat treatment at 280 °C,
and this showed that TA–Fe3+ could attach to the
surface of Mg(OH)2 in the extrusion process.

2.2 Mechanical Properties of the Composites
Generally, a major shortcoming with respect to traditional inorganic
flame retardants is the deterioration of mechanical properties resulting
from their poor homogeneous dispersion. On the basis of the interfacial
modification method of mussel-inspired materials, the initial interest
was to improve inorganic filler dispersion and mechanical properties.
The mechanical properties of the composites were measured by tensile
testing, and the results are shown in Figure 5. The tensile strength of the material was
found to increase first and later decrease with an increasing amount
of unmodified Mg(OH)2. At the same time, both the plasticity
and the elongation of the material were decreased. The rupture elongation
of PA 6 composites with 45 wt % Mg(OH)2 was decreased by
80% in comparison with that of the PA composite containing 15 wt %
Mg(OH)2.

Figure 5 (a) Stress–strain curves of PA with different composites
and (b) the partially enlarged image of (a).

The composite materials with modified Mg(OH)2 showed
better mechanical properties such that the elongation and tensile
strength of the composites at the low dosage (15 and 30 wt %) were
improved. The elongation of 45 wt % modified Mg(OH)2 composites
was slightly decreased but the tensile strength was increased by 90%.
This might due to the multiple hydroxyl groups of TA which could produce
stronger hydrogen-bonding forces with the nylon polymer, as described
in the Figure 1. Thus,
the resulting materials had improved mechanical properties because
of the surface modification, which was also observed in the SEM photos
of the tensile fracture surface shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 SEM results of the microstructure of the tensile
failure section
of the composites with 45 wt % (a) Mg(OH)2 and (b) modified
Mg(OH)2.

As shown in Figure 6, the sample section
of PA 6 with unmodified 45 wt % Mg(OH)2 had obvious Mg(OH)2 lumps, and there was a distinct phase
separation at the interface between Mg(OH)2 and PA 6. This
indicated that Mg(OH)2 was more prone to self-aggregation
due to the strong polarity interaction of Mg(OH)2 with
itself because of the incompatibility between Mg(OH)2 and
PA 6. The defects of these phases were more likely to produce stress
concentrations when the sample was stretched, resulting in reduced
mechanical properties of the sample. However, there was no obvious
phase separation in the cross section of TA–Fe3+-modified composites, and large agglomeration of Mg(OH)2 was diminished. This indicated that the surface modification of
the bioadhesive mussel coating could greatly improve the compatibility
between the interfaces of the composites and metal hydroxide, resulting
in the improvement of their mechanical properties. At the same time,
more drawing phenomena occurred at the cross section of the composite
with modified Mg(OH)2. This revealed a stronger interaction
between the modified composites, which was related to the formation
of hydrogen bonds between the TA–Fe3+-modified layer
and nylon.

2.3 Combustion Behavior
As depicted in Figure 7, after adding 0,
15, 30, and 45 wt % Mg(OH)2 flame retardant into PA 6,
the LOI values of PA 6 were increased from 22.1 vol % to 23.7, 25.1,
and 29.1 vol %, respectively. It could be stated that a higher oxygen
density was required to initiate and sustain the combustion of the
specimen after the addition of Mg(OH)2 into neat PA 6.
It was nonobvious in low content, which was due to Mg(OH)2 by blocking the moisture released during thermal decomposition,
leading to reducing the temperature in the combustion zone. In contrast
with the LOI value of 23.7% for 15 wt % Mg(OH)2 in PA 6,
the same content of added TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 showed the LOI value of 25.6%, which was an improvement by 1.9%.
This phenomenon not only appeared in low mass fractions but also in
the higher mass fractions, for example, 30 wt % (LOI value 27.5%)
and 45 wt % (LOI value 31.2%), which indicated that Fe3+ with atomic-level distribution distinctly hindered the ignition
behavior. Interestingly, 30 wt % modified Mg(OH)2/PA 6
compound (containing less flame-retardant additives) compared with
45 wt % unmodified Mg(OH)2/PA 6 compound showed the same
UL-94 classification. It was revealed that there existed a synergistic
effect between the TA–Fe3+ and Mg(OH)2 system, and thus, increasing the TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 content was a more effective approach to enhance the flame
retardancy of neat PA 6.

Figure 7 (a) LOI and UL-94 results of PA 6/Mg(OH)2 and PA 6/Mg(OH)2/TA–Fe3+ and
(b) the experimental (exp.)
and calculated (cal.) TGA curves of TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2.

To investigate the synergistic
effect of TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2, their thermal
decomposition behavior was investigated
by using TGA under air, as shown in Figure 7b. The experimental (exp.) curve was obtained
by TGA and the calculated (cal.) curve was calculated according to
the weight percentage of every component (as seen in Figure S3) in the compound.27 The
results revealed that TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 had a three-step degradation in the TGA curve. There was little
degradation before 380 °C, which might due to the dehydration
of TA, elimination of acetic acid, and decarboxylation.26 At this stage, the exp. value was smaller than
the cal. value, which meant that Mg(OH)2 catalyzed the
degradation of TA–Fe3+. From 380 to 420 °C,
the degradation was mainly due to the decomposition of Mg(OH)2. After 420 °C, the exp. value was much larger than the
cal. value, which meant that there was a remarkable synergistic effect
between MgO [decomposition by Mg(OH)2] and TA–Fe3+. Mg(OH)2 and its decomposition product MgO combined
with the Fe element to facilitate the TA degradation to form a refractory
aromatic compound and char, which was effective in reducing mass/heat
transfer. After 680 °C, the compound was burned because of the
presence of oxygen.

Cone calorimeter testing (CCT) is regarded
as the most useful bench-scale
tests that can simulate real-world fire conditions.28 To identify the role of TA–Fe3+ and Mg(OH)2 during the combustion process of the PA samples, CCT was
used. The detected samples included neat PA 6, PA 6 with 45 wt % Mg(OH)2, and PA 6 with 45 wt % TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2.

Heat release rate (HRR) is a measure to test the heat
release per
unit surface area of burning materials, which is believed to have
the greatest influence on burning behavior.29 The HRR curves for each sample are presented in Figure 8a. It was shown that the neat
PA burned fast after ignition with the peak of heat release rate (PHRR)
of 512 kW/m2. The PHRR value was significantly reduced
in the presence of Mg(OH)2 (263 kW/m2), and
it reached 195 kW/m2, a 26% reduction, with the incorporation
of TA–Fe3+. This indicated that TA–Fe3+ chelate-modified Mg(OH)2 improved the flame-retardant
properties of the composite. There was no residue found for neat PA
6 after CCT. In the case of PA 6 with Mg(OH)2/TA–Fe3+, the char was more compact and stronger (as shown in Figures S4 and S5),
whereas for PA 6 with Mg(OH)2, it was more vulnerable and
fragile, which indicated that unmodified Mg(OH)2 was less
effective in reducing mass/heat transfer of the composite.

Figure 8 Measured (a)
HRR and (b) THR curves of PA 6, PA 6/Mg(OH)2, and PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 with the
fire-retardant mass fraction of 45%.

The total heat release (THR) curves presented in Figure 8b exhibit results
similar to
those of HRR. The THR curves showed that neat PA 6 released a total
heat of 138.2 MW/m2 at the end of burning, whereas it was
99.1 and 83.9 MW/m2 in the case of PA 6/Mg(OH)2 and PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2, respectively,
with a 16% reduction relative to PA 6/Mg(OH)2. The THR
values indicate that the TA–Fe3+ chelate showed
prominent synergy with Mg(OH)2 and yielded a higher flame-retardant
efficiency.

Figure 9 shows the
mass loss (ML) curves of different samples. After the cone calorimeter
test, there were 0, 26.2, and 32.4 wt % of residue left, respectively,
for neat PA 6, PA 6/Mg(OH)2, and PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2. PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 showed the lowest ML value, which indicated that PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 had the highest residual carbon. This
was due to the following two reasons: first, the Mg(OH)2 and Fe element facilitated the TA degradation and then formed the
refractory aromatic compound and char (as seen Figure 7b) and second, the Fe3+ ion in
TA–Fe3+ was transformed into Fe2O330 after the combustion process
(seen the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results in Figure S6), which also promoted the catalytic
charring behavior. The synergistic effect between TA–Fe3+ and Mg(OH)2 and the catalytic ability of Fe2O3 facilitated the generation of compact char which
improved the flame-retardant properties of the composite material
simultaneously.

Figure 9 ML as a function of time.

The smoke production rate (SPR) and total smoke production
(TSP)
are the important factors in death by fire.29 The SPR and TSP curves in Figure 10 revealed that the addition of 45 wt % Mg(OH)2 in the PA 6 matrix could notably suppress combustion, while the
peak SPR value (0.245 m2 s–1) of the
compound was the highest among all samples, as shown in Figure 10a. Additionally,
the TSP value of PA 6 was higher than that of PA 6/Mg(OH)2 (2.1 m2) after 1377 s which indicated Mg(OH)2 as a smoke suppressor for PA. TA–Fe3+ chelate-modified
Mg(OH)2 illustrated the prominent smoke suppression effect.
PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 (45 wt %) gave rise
to a remarkable reduction of peak SPR and the TSP values to 0.177
m2 s–1 and 1.307 m2, revealing
the reduction percentage of 28 and 38% relative to PA 6/Mg(OH)2, respectively. Simultaneously, the PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 specimen emitted smoke after 200 s and
took longer time to reach the maximum smoke density, which signified
that the iron salt made the spline a flameless combustion model by
effectively reducing the burning rate and the amount of smoke. This
was due to the inherent smoke inhibition of iron31 and the prominent synergistic effects with Mg(OH)2.

Figure 10 (a) SPR and (b) total SPR as a function of time.

Apart from the abovementioned LOI, HRR, THR, ML, SPR, and
TSP,
another important parameter for evaluating flame retardation of polymeric
materials is the emission of toxic gases which are a secondary fire
risk. The toxic gases generated by combustion principally are CO accompanied
with CO2.32 Therefore, the determination
of CO from various materials is conducive to illustrate the relative
risks.

Figure 11 illustrated
that the CO production (COP) was slightly increased over the period
of 440 s when Mg(OH)2 was added into PA 6, whereas 45 wt
% PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 showed an increase
in COP after 500 s. This was attributed to the better flame-retardant
properties of TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 and the
resulting incomplete flammability of the composites.

of time.

2.4 Proposed
Mechanism
The mussel-inspired
biomimic TA–Fe3+ chelate coating grew evenly on
the surface of flame-retardant Mg(OH)2, which reduced the
polarity of the Mg(OH)2 surface and resulted in the reduction
of agglomeration, and additionally, it favored the distribution of
Mg(OH)2 in the PA 6 matrix. The formation of holes became
hard when broken, thus improving the mechanical properties of the
material. It was noteworthy that because of the structure of TA and
nylon, there were a large number of hydrogen bonds, which also improved
the mechanical properties of the compound. While considering the fire
resistance, the uniform distribution of Mg(OH)2 could improve
the utilization of flame-retardant materials and enhance the flame-retardant
properties. During combustion, Fe2O3 formed
by uniformly dispersed iron ions on the material surface catalyzed
charring more effectively, which in turn improved fire retardancy.
This phenomenon could be attributed to the strong protective effect
from the formation of a carbonaceous layer. Meanwhile, the phenyl
ring compound formed by the Mg(OH)2 and Fe element synergistic
and thermal decomposition of TA was surmised to cross-link the matrix
material for the formation of char. The above reasons resulted in
compact and tough carbon, which was beneficial to reduce the overall
loss of mass, heat transfer, and slow the degradation of the polymer,
thus enhancing the flame retardancy in the condensed phase. The iron
element and Mg(OH)2 as smoke inhibitors served to reduce
the smoke content during combustion by their synergistic effects,
thus depressing possible smoke poisoning in realistic fires.

3 Summary
The low-cost bio-inspired mussel adhesion material
TA–Fe3+ has been successfully grown on the surface
of Mg(OH)2, a flame retardant, and the modified flame retardant
material
could be evenly dispersed in the PA matrix. Meanwhile, the functional
group such as the hydroxyl from TA formed strong interactions with
PA 6 by hydrogen bonding, which significantly improved the mechanical
properties of the resulting composites. Iron was evenly dispersed
on the surface of Mg(OH)2; the Mg(OH)2 and Fe
element synergistically facilitated the TA degradation to form the
refractory compound and char during the combustion process and ferric
oxide was yielded simultaneously. This encouraged the formation of
a dense carbon layer by catalytic charring at the interface, which
increased the amount of carbon residue resulting in reducing quality
loss and heat transfer. At the same time, modified Mg(OH)2, a smoke inhibitor, significantly reduced the smoke density by synergistic
effect with Mg(OH)2. On the account of the general growth
and adhesion characteristics of TA–Fe3+, this can
be regarded as a low-cost, convenient, and general method to prepare
high-strength and efficient flame-retardant materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TA,
ferric trichloride,
and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Beijing Chemicals Co. (Beijing,
China). PA 6 chips (relative viscosity of 2.5, density of 1.127 g
cm–3) and Mg(OH)2 (5000 mesh, purity
≥ 95%) were provided by Suzhou Enhanry Advanced Materials Co.,
Ltd. All of the chemicals were used as received.

4.2 Preparation of TA–Fe3+-Modified
Mg(OH)2
TA (2g) and 2 g of ferric trichloride
were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water separately to form solutions.
Mg(OH)2 (400 g) was dispersed in 600 mL of deionized water.
Then, solutions of both TA and ferric chloride were added into the
Mg(OH)2 solution simultaneously, followed by fast and vigorous
stirring for 2 min. Meanwhile, NaOH was used to adjust the pH to 8.
The mixed solution was filtered and washed. The overall procedure
was repeated three times. Later, the product was dried in a vacuum
oven at 90 °C. The dry compound was pounded in a mortar and then
sieved through a 200 mesh screen to produce TA–Fe3+-modified Mg(OH)2.

4.3 Preparation
of the PA Composite Material
The PA 6/Mg(OH)2 composite
and PA 6/TA–Fe3+/Mg(OH)2 composite were
prepared with a single-screw
extruder. To mix granulation, it was partly injected into a standard
spline and then related mechanical performance test was conducted.
The other composite was heated in the mold and cured, and then, the
sample was cut precisely, which was subjected to the fire testing.
The composites added contained 15% Mg(OH)2 and were denoted
as 15 wt % PA 6/Mg(OH)2.

4.4 Characterization
4.4.1 LOI Test
The LOI test was conducted
with the JF-3 oxygen index test instrument (Jiangning, China) in terms
of the standard LOI test, ASTM D 2863-97. The sample size for the
LOI measurement was 100 × 10 × 10 mm3. Each measurement
was repeated at least five times, and the results were reported as
the average LOI value in this work.

4.4.2 Vertical
Burning Tests
The vertical
burning test was performed with a CZF-II horizontal and vertical burning
tester (Jiang Ning Analysis Instrument Company, China). The samples
used were 130 × 12.7 × 3 mm3 according to the
UL94 test (ASTM D3801 standard). The procedures of conducting this
test as well as the definitions and units of vertical burning rate
were referred based on the literature.23 Each measurement was repeated at least five times, and the results
were reported as the average value in this work.

4.4.3 Mechanical Properties
The mechanical
properties were analyzed using a WSM-20KB universal testing machine
(Changchun, China) according to GB/T 1040-2006. Three samples were
used and the results were averaged for this analysis.

4.4.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis
TGA
was carried out on a HCT-2 thermal analyzer (Beijing Hengjiu Scientific
Instrument Factory) under air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1. Samples (4 mg), at room temperature initially,
were heated from room temperature to 800 °C.

4.4.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
surface morphology of the specimens was investigated by SEM using
JEOL 7500. The samples were sputter-coated in gold before scanning
to provide an electrically conductive surface. The acceleration voltage
used for imaging was 5 kV.

4.4.6 Cone Calorimeter Testing
A Cone
calorimeter ASTM M 1354 was used for predicting the HRRs of materials
and products. Approximately, 13.1 MJ of heat was released per kilogram
of oxygen consumed. The external heat flux was 55 kW m–2 because it corresponds to a common heat flux in a mild fire scenario.
The samples with dimensions of 100 × 100 × 3 mm3 were exposed to a Stanton Redcroft cone calorimeter with a heat
flux of 55 kW m–2. The averaged cone data obtained
from three replicated experiments are reported in this work.

4.4.7 FT-IR Spectra
The FT-IR spectra
were measured on an IS 5 (Nicolet) spectrophotometer in the range
of 4000–600 cm–1 at a resolution of 0.5 cm–1. The samples were first ground and then mixed with
KBr to form pellets.
