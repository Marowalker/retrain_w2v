Demands for engineering thermal transport
properties are ever increasing
for a wide range of modern micro- and nanodevices and materials-based
energy technologies. In particular, there is a severe situation due
to the rapid progress in the synthesis and processing of materials
and devices with structural characteristic length on the nanometer
scales, which are comparable or even smaller than the intrinsic length
scales (such as mean free path and wavelength) of basic energy carriers
(such as phonons, electrons, and photons). Although advanced approaches
for controlling the electronic and photonic transport have been proposed
in the past decades, progress on controlling lattice vibrations (i.e.,
the phonons) is still far behind. Gaps between the fundamental understandings
of the behavior of the basic energy carriers at small scales and the
technological demands still remain, particularly from a computer modeling
point of view. Herewith, we give a perspective of the computational
approaches for predicting the thermal transport properties of low-dimensional
materials and nanostructures, which are mainly sorted into three categories:
empirical molecular dynamics, anharmonic lattice dynamics based Boltzmann
transport equation, and Landauer theory. The advantage and disadvantage
of each method are discussed and some possible solutions are suggested.
The discussion is focused on fully and accurately characterizing the
mode-level phonon behavior, possible all-order phonon scattering process,
and incorporation of realistic nanostructures. Moreover, emerging
challenges of phonon coupling effects, such as electron–phonon,
phonon–photon, and phonon–magnon coupling, are also
discussed. We expect that this perspective will stimulate future research
in computer modeling of micro-/nanoscale heat transfer beyond traditional
phonons.

I Introduction
In recent years, increasing
attention has been focused on the thermal
transport properties of nanomaterials and nanostructures due to the
rapid development of nanotechnology. On the one hand, one expects
to have a high thermal conductivity for cooling the nanoelectronics
and optoelectronics or for efficient interfacial thermal transport,
where the heat can dissipate rapidly and the temperature of the systems
can be effectively controlled, and therefore their functional performance
can be maintained. On the other hand, a low thermal conductivity is
preferred for thermoelectric energy conversion, where the low thermal
conductivity is the key point to achieve a high figure of merit (ZT) because ZT is inversely proportional
to thermal conductivity. Based on the fact that in most thermoelectrics
the phonon mean free path is much longer than that of electrons, one
strategy to improve ZT is to reduce the lattice thermal
conductivity by nanostructuring. Therefore, developing computational
methods to model heat transfer in nanostructures will provide an insight
into the understanding of physical aspects, and therefore guide the
nanofabrication techniques.

In the past few decades, many computational
methods have been developed
and applied to predict the thermal transport properties of nanostructures.
These methods can be largely grouped into three categories. The first
category includes methods based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
These include the equilibrium MD (EMD) method based on the Green–Kubo
formula,1 the nonequilibrium MD (NEMD)
method,2−4 directly based on the Fourier’s law, and the
approach-to-equilibrium MD (AEMD) method.5,6 The
second category includes methods based on the Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE)7−10 and the lattice dynamics (LD).11 The
third category includes methods based on the Landauer formula or more
generally the nonequilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF) formalism.12,13 For all of the methods, the dynamics of the studied systems can
be described by either the empirical potentials or the quantum mechanics.
For the BTE and the NEGF methods, mode-by-mode spectral properties
can be naturally obtained, whereas only the total thermal conductivity
(or conductance) is calculated in the MD-based methods. However, many
spectral decomposition methods in the framework of MD simulations
have also been recently developed, including the time-domain normal
mode analysis,14 the spectrum energy density
method,15 and the spectrum heat current
method or the frequency domain direct decomposed method.16,17 In the following, we discuss the advantages and challenges for each
method.

II Molecular Dynamics: Quantum Corrections, Improving
the Accuracy and Speed
A crucial advantage of the MD-based
methods is that the anharmonicity
of the lattice vibration is fully accounted for. Furthermore, MD simulations
can also be used to predict the thermal stability of the systems.
Despite these advantages, there are a few challenges in these methods,
as discussed below. The most fundamental limitation of the MD simulations
is the classical distribution of phonons, in terms of correctly capturing
the phonon behavior at different temperatures, i.e., the trajectories
of atoms are integrated according to the classical Newtonian mechanics
and therefore quantum effects are ignored. Due to the classical assumptions,
phonons in the MD simulations follow the Boltzmann distribution, i.e., f(ωi) = 1/eℏωi/kBT, instead of the physically correct Bose–Einstein distribution,
i.e., f(ωi) = (eℏωi/kBT – 1)−1.
As a result, the energy equipartition theorem is applied in the MD
simulations, which means that at any temperature T all of the phonons with whatever frequency ωi are activated and each phonon mode has the same energy of kBT. Physically speaking, this
assumption is only valid when the temperature of the system is much
higher than the Debye temperature TD (T ≫ TD), at which the
Bose–Einstein distribution can be simplified to the Boltzmann
distribution. At temperatures well below the Debye temperature, the
high-frequency phonons are at most partially activated rather than
fully occupied as in MD simulations. Therefore, MD simulations are
usually conducted at relatively high temperatures, in which case,
the de Broglie wavelength of the atoms is smaller than the interatomic
distance and the atoms can be treated classically. Figure 1 shows an example of the thermal
conductivity of bulk silicon, germanium, and diamond. We can easily
see that the thermal conductivity calculated using the MD simulations
is inaccurate at low temperatures due to the wrong distribution function
of phonons. To overcome this fundamental limitation, different quantum
corrections in MD simulations have been proposed, such as temperature
correction18,19 and quantum thermal bath.20 The temperature correction is made by equating
the total energies of the classical and quantum systems, which means
that 1  where the summations are taken over all of
the phonon modes denoted by N wave vectors k⃗ and 3n dispersion branches ν,
and EC and EQ are the classical and quantum phonon energies, respectively. By
assuming that the quantum energy is harmonic and the classical energy
is equipartitioned, the relation between TC and TQ can be determined and the quantum-corrected
thermal conductivity can be written as 2  where κC and κQ are the classical and quantum thermal conductivities, respectively.
However, the above equation is questionable, as it is not derived
from the fundamental relations and has not been rigorously proved.
Seeking a reliable quantum correction method in the MD method is significantly
important and still unsolved.21,22

Figure 1 Comparison of thermal
conductivity of bulk silicon (a), germanium
(b), and diamond (c) between EMD simulations (black dots) and BTE
(lines). The red and black line is the BTE result from the single
relaxation time approximation and iterative solution, respectively.

The second challenge for the MD-based
methods is that the results
sensitively depend on the accuracy of the interatomic potential used.
For instance, the thermal conductivity of bulk silicon can differ
by two times23,24 when using different potentials
to describe the interactions among the Si atoms. Generating accurate
potentials, particularly for complex systems, is quite challenging
and of great importance for the MD-based methods. Furthermore, transferability
of the empirical potentials is also crucial. Most of the potentials
are developed for describing specific bulklike materials. Applying
them directly to low-dimensional materials and nanostructures is usually
questionable. To improve the transferability, one may need to construct
different potential models for different situations, and the atomicrex
package25 provides many features to facilitate
this task. Alternatively, with the development of computational technologies,
these problems may be solved by using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations,
in which there is no requirement of any empirical inputs. Recently,
Marcolongo et al.26 and Stackhouse et al.27 have demonstrated that this idea is possible
to be realized in AIMD. However, more effort is needed to improve
this method due to the quite expensive computational resources required
by AIMD.

The last challenge for the MD-based methods concerns
the space
and time scales achievable using the computational resources available
currently and in the future. The MD-based methods are linear scaling
with respect to the number of atoms in terms of both memory usage
and computation time, allowing for relatively large simulation cell
sizes. The number of atoms has reached 5 million using the NEMD method28 and 9 million using the AEMD method,29 which are indeed impressive. However, it is
still computationally challenging to use the MD-based methods to simulate
systems with experimentally comparable large-scale structures. On
the other hand, the maximum correlation time for observing a converged
thermal conductivity in the EMD method can sometimes be very long,
and it also requires many (of the order of 100) independent simulations
to obtain accurate results. For example, it has been demonstrated
that the thermal conductivity of pristine graphene only converges
up to a correlation time of about 10 ns,28 and it even takes about 100 ns for the convergence of the thermal
conductivity of ultrathin silicon nanowires (NWs).30 Therefore, high-performance computing via parallelization
is desirable for the MD-based methods. Apart from the conventional
parallelization with CPUs, parallel graphics processing units (GPUs)
computing provides an emerging way to achieve a high price–performance
ratio. An efficient GPU-based MD code called GPUMD31 has been built from the ground up to improve the state-of-the-art
in terms of the performance for simulations with many-body potentials
on GPUs by an order of magnitude (Figure 2). The current single-GPU version of GPUMD
can simulate systems with up to tens of millions of atoms, and we
expect that the continuous improvement in the computational power
of GPUs and further parallelization using multiple GPUs can bring
this limit up to about 1 billion, allowing for modeling many interesting
nanostructures.

precisions. The test system is bulk silicon with 256 000 atoms

all of the three directions) with the many-body Tersoff potential.

III Boltzmann Transport Equation: Considering
the Reality of Structures and Higher-Order Scattering Process
When the wavelength (mean free path) is much smaller (larger) than
the size of the wave packet, the lattice vibration, which is the main
heat carrier in dielectric solids, can be treated as a quantum particle:
phonon. The thermal conductivity tensor can then be computed as 3  where c(k⃗, ν) is the volumetric phonon specific heat, v⃗g(k⃗, ν) is the phonon group
velocity, and τ(k⃗, ν) is the
phonon relaxation time. The group velocity can be calculated using
LD, whereas the relaxation time can be obtained by solving the BTE.
In recent years, the anharmonic LD-based BTE method7−9 has become one
of the most popular methods to calculate thermal conductivity due
to its easy input (only the force constants) and accuracy (can be
combined with first principles). This method has been proved to be
able to accurately calculate the thermal conductivity for most bulk
materials32,33 when the three-phonon scattering process
is dominant in the system and the force constants are evaluated directly
by the first principles. To calculate the thermal conductivity of
nanostructures using the BTE method, one needs to assume that phonon
confinement can be ignored in the system and only the relaxation time
is affected by the so called “nano effect” by using
the Matthiessen’s rule.10 However, it is well known that the phonon dispersion will
be modified considerably when the size of the nanostructure is below
20 nm,34 which means that the popular BTE
method used to calculate the thermal conductivity of nanostructures
with a grain size smaller than 20 nm is questionable. One possible
way to solve this problem is to calculate the thermal conductivity
of the nanostructures directly, e.g., treating the nanostructure as
a new system with a new primitive cell or unit cell. In this case,
the phonon dispersions could be quite different from the bulk counterpart.
Due to the computational complexity, the maximum number of atoms in
the system is limited to up to several hundreds of atoms,30 and only some special systems, such as nanowires30 or nanotubes,7 can
be treated. Another concern for the BTE method is the higher-order
phonon scattering process. Recently, researchers have found that only
considering the three-phonon scattering process is far from being
enough for some systems at high temperatures.35 For instance, the thermal conductivity of diamond at 1000 K computed
by considering three-phonon process is overestimated by about 20%
compared to the EMD result using the same empirical potential (Figure 1c). Introducing a
higher-order phonon process to the BTE method is important for strongly
anharmonic systems35 and systems with large
phonon band gaps.36 However, explicitly
calculating the higher-order phonon process is computationally expensive.
It will be helpful to develop an efficient approach to evaluate the
importance of the higher-order phonon processes without doing expensive
calculations.

Finally, the static method (i.e., finite displacement
method and
density functional perturbation theory) used to calculate the force
constants as inputs for solving the BTE is inaccurate or even totally
wrong for some systems, such as PbTe37 and
SnSe.38 For example, one would obtain imaginary
frequencies using the static method for SnSe,38 which means that the system is “unstable”. Such a
conclusion is wrong because experiments evidently show that bulk SnSe
is stable.39 Therefore, it is necessary
to include the anharmonicity into the force constants. A promising
way to solve this problem is to calculate the temperature-dependent
force constants using a fitting procedure,40,41 which has been demonstrated to successfully account for the intrinsic
anharmonicity.

IV Landauer Theory: Beyond
Ballistic and Small-Size
System
The phonon conduction can be represented on the concept
of wave
scattering, which is similar to the electron just as Landauer did
in 1957. In the Landauer theory, the spectral heat current from the
left lead to the right lead through a junction connecting the two
leads at two different equilibrium heat-bath temperatures (TL and TR, respectively)
is 4  

Then, the spectral
thermal conductance G(ω)
can be written as 5  where T(ω) is the frequency-dependent
transmission and A is the cross-sectional area of
the system. The transmission can be calculated by using the NEGF method.12,13,42 The main drawback of this method
is that it is computationally challenging to account for phonon anharmonicity,
which is particularly important for systems with short phonon mean
free paths.43,44 To include inelastic phonon–phonon
scattering, one has to calculate the many-body self-energy and the
device Green’s function self-consistently,45,46 which severely limits the system size that can be treated. An alternative
way to solve this problem is to calculate the transmission coefficient
from NEMD.17,47 In NEMD, the heat current spectrum Q(ω) can be obtained via 6  where U is the potential
and ΔT is the temperature difference between
the left lead and the right lead, which are separated by a true or
imaginary interface.47 The angular brackets
here represent the time average in MD simulations. Combining eqs 4 and 6, it is easy to know 7  

Figure 3 shows
the
phonon transmission at K or Cl twin boundary. The results inherently
include the anharmonicity due to the intrinsic anharmonicity in the
atomic velocity and interatomic potential used. Using this method,
the system one can deal with can be as large as ten millions of atoms.
In addition, by using the force constants to replace the potential
in eq 7, it is easy to
extend this method to ab initio NEMD, which is being done by Hu’s
group. Another bottleneck of the Landauer theory is the lack of phonon
mode information. Generally speaking, there always exist several different
phonon modes at one particular frequency, which cannot be distinguished
via the traditional Green’s function method. Although these
phonon modes hold the same frequency, they might play different contributions
to the thermal transport. As a result, to thoroughly reveal the phonon
transport process, we must extend the atomistic Green’s function
and obtain the mode-resolved phonon transmission. Such an attempt
has recently been done by Latour et al.48 and Sadasivam et al.49

coefficient calculated via eq 6. The black and red line denotes the transmission for K and
Cl at the twin boundary, respectively.

V Thermal Transport Beyond Traditional Phonons:
Coupling Effects
Although phonons are the main heat carrier
in most semiconductor
structures, other energy carriers, such as electrons, magnons, and
photons, can also carry heat especially when there is high carrier
density, strong external electric or magnetic field, and light exposure,
and their quantum behaviors are not independent but interdependent
on each other50 (Figure 4). In addition, for metallic systems, electrons
dominate the thermal transport and the key quantity of electron relaxation
time is determined by the electron–phonon interaction.50 In polar semiconductors, such as GaN,51 the Fröhlich electron–phonon coupling
is strong and its influence on phononic thermal transport is of great
significance. Generally speaking, all of these quasi-particles can
be adopted in BTE because they are either bosons or fermions. For
instance, the electrical thermal conductivity can be calculated by
the semiclassical BTE under the constant carrier relaxation time assumption.52 By applying the Fermi’s golden rule,
the scattering rate matrix can be expressed, and then, the relaxation
time of the charge carriers, magnons and photons, can be computed
by solving the BTE. The robust theory and computing algorithms for
carriers has been realized recently for bulk materials53 and interfaces.54,55 However, such
a method is only valid for small cell sizes with no more than 50 atoms,
and thus can only deal with some simple systems. Also, to accurately
determine the phononic thermal transport in magnetic materials, the
phonon–magnon interaction plays a nontrivial role. However,
currently, there is no unified theory to quantify it, despite the
experiments that have verified its existence.56 For nanostructures, the low-dimension confinement can induce relatively
strong magnetic properties, and then the phonon–magnon interaction
would be critical to determine the phonon transport. To quantify the
contribution of phonon–magnon interaction to thermal transport,
one feasible way is to compute phonons, such as dispersion curve and
density of states, under the influence of external magnetic field
and then calculate the thermal conductivity within empirical formula.
Actually, all of the three approaches mentioned above have the potential
to compute the thermal transport in such a system. For the first-principles
MD method, the heat current contributed from phonon, photon, and electron
can be possibly calculated,26 and then
the thermal transport properties considering such coupling effects
can be computed by Green–Kubo EMD or Fourier’s law (NEMD).
In the framework of BTE, the scattering rates of phonon, electron–phonon,
and photon–phonon for the bulk materials can be calculated
first, and the total scattering rate can then be obtained via the
Matthiessen’s rule by combining with the boundary scattering.
At the same time, under the promise of computational power, the system
shown in Figure 4 can
be treated as a single unit cell directly, and thus the assumption
of boundary scattering can be avoided. In the framework of Landauer
theory, similar to the BTE method, one also first needs to calculate
the relaxation time due to phonon–phonon, phonon–photon,
and phonon–electron scattering, etc., and then the total thermal
transport properties of such a system can be obtained under the assumption
of boundary scattering. Meanwhile, it is also possible to treat the
system as a single unit cell and then calculate the relevant thermal
transport properties.

interactions in nanostructures.

VI Discussion and Conclusions
Although there
is still large room to improve the methodologies
mentioned above, some of them have been already successfully applied
to predict the thermal transport properties of low-dimensional materials
and nanostructures. For instance, the BTE method has been widely used
to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of nanowires (NWs) and
nanostructures, and the predictions are in good agreement with the
experimental measurements.57,58 MD simulations have
promised to provide the correct trend and comparable results with
respect to experimental investigations in the polycrystalline nanostructures.59,60 The Landauer theory is a powerful method to give a valid prediction
of the thermal conductance at the interface compared to experimental
results. For more details, we recommend reading the review article
by Wang et al.13

To summarize, in
this perspective, we discuss the major computational
methods to compute the thermal transport properties of low-dimensional
materials and nanostructures. Three types of methods, namely molecular
dynamics, anharmonic lattice dynamics based Boltzmann transport equation,
and Landauer theory, are introduced. The disadvantages of these methods
in dealing with the low-dimensional materials and nanostructures are
presented and some possible solutions are given. (1) For classical
molecular dynamics simulations, quantum effects and inaccurate potentials
are the two main issues. The probable solution for the first difficulty
is to develop an effective quantum correction method. The second challenge
can be solved via using ab initio molecular dynamics and developing
more adequate potentials, such as using machine learning. Meanwhile,
the computational efficiency can be improved significantly by using
GPU computing. (2) In anharmonic lattice dynamics based BTE, structural
reality, higher-order phonon scattering process, and temperature-dependent
interatomic force constants are three tremendous challenges. Future
work should focus on these three aspects to make this method more
robust. (3) Running NEMD instead of the atomistic Green’s function
to introduce anharmonicity into the Landauer theory could be an efficient
way to enhance the accuracy of thermal transport calculations. Finally,
we also give the perspective for studying the coupling effect between
traditional phonons and other energy carriers and/or quasi-particles,
such as electrons, magnons, and photons, which is expected to be one
of the future research direction for thermal or more broad energy
transport process in some emerging nanotechnologies.
