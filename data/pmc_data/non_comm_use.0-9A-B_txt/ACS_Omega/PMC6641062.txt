Ethylene tetramerization
catalyst systems comprising a Cr(III)
complex containing PNP ligands and methylaluminoxane (MAO) are useful
for the production of 1-octene. However, a concern with these systems
is the use of expensive MAO in excess. Herein, we report a catalytic
system that avoids the use of MAO. Metathesis of CrCl3(THF)3 and [(CH3CN)4Ag]+[B(C6F5)4]− afforded [L4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (L = CH3CN or tetrahydrofuran (THF)), which was converted to [(PNP)CrCl2L2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, where PNP is iPrN(PPh2)2 (1) or [CH3(CH2)16]2CHN(PPh2)2 (2). The
molecular structures of [(THF)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− and [1-CrCl2(THF)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− were
unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography. The cationic (PNP)CrIII complexes paired with [B(C6F5)4]− anions, that is, [(PNP)CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, exhibited high activity
in chlorobenzene when activated with common trialkylaluminum species
(Me3Al, Et3Al, and iBu3Al). The activities
and selectivity were comparable to those of the original MAO-based
Sasol system (1-CrCl3/MAO). When activated
with Et3Al or iBu3Al, the Cr complex, [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, which
bears long alkyl chains, showed high activity in the more desirable
methylcyclohexane solvent (89 kg/g-Cr/h) and much higher activity
in cyclohexene (168 kg/g-Cr/h). Other advantages of the [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al system in cyclohexene were negligible catalyst deactivation, formation
of only a negligible amount of polyethylene side product (0.3%), and
formation of fewer unwanted side products above C10. The [B(C6F5)4]− anion is compatible
with trialkylaluminum species once it is not paired with a trityl
cation. Hence, [(PNP)CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al exhibited a significantly higher activity than
that of a previously reported system composed of [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−, that is, 1/CrCl3(THF)3/[Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al.

Introduction
Production of linear
α-olefins (LAOs) through ethylene oligomerization
is an important issue in both industry and academia,1−6 and development of efficient catalysts for this process is an active
research area.7−22 LAOs are used in the polyolefin industry as comonomers, and demand
for them has increased with the increase in polyolefin production
using the homogeneous metallocene-type catalysts. Recently, LAOs have
also been used in the production of poly(α-olefin) lubricant
base-stocks.23 LAOs can be separated from
wide-distribution mixtures of 1-alkenes that are produced using nickel
catalysts via the Shell higher olefin process.24,25 Catalysts that can selectively generate 1-hexene or 1-octene from
ethylene have also been discovered. For example, a trimerization catalyst
composed of pyrrole, (2-ethylhexanoate)3Cr(III), and an
alkylaluminum reagent (Et3Al + Et2AlCl) was
discovered at Phillips in the early 1990s,26−28 and a tetramerization
catalyst composed of iPrN(PPh2)2 (1), Cr(acac)3, and methylaluminoxane (MAO) was discovered
at Sasol in the early 2000s.29−33 There is some controversy concerning the active species in these
selective oligomerization catalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) studies showed that the majority of CrIII precursors
were converted to EPR-silent CrII by the action of the
alkylaluminum cocatalyst.34−36 On the basis of this observation,
a catalytic cycle involving the CrII/IV species was proposed,37,38 but a catalytic cycle involving the cationic CrI/III species
paired with a MAO-derived noncoordinating anion is currently more
generally accepted (Scheme 1).34,35,38−40 We recently prepared various zwitterionic CrII complexes, but none of them were active in ethylene oligomerization,
convincing us of the validity of the catalytic cycle involving cationic
CrI/III species.41

Scheme 1 Active
Species Proposed for Ethylene Tetramerization, and the CrIII Complexes Targeted in This Work
Although the Phillips system requires inexpensive alkylaluminum
Et3Al and Et2AlCl as an activator, the use of
expensive MAO in excess (Al/Cr, 300–500) is a critical concern
when considering the commercial application of the Sasol system. A
catalytic system containing [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]− instead of
MAO (i.e., 1-CrIIICl3/[Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al) was proposed on the basis of the aforementioned
catalytic cycle involving cationic CrI/III species, but
its activity was significantly inferior to that of the MAO-derived
system and resulted in the generation of a large amount of polyethylene
(PE).42 Its failure was attributed to the
instability of [B(C6F5)4]− anions, and efforts were made to develop other types of noncoordinating
anions, leading to the development of catalytic systems containing
[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]− anions (e.g., CrCl3(THF)3/1/AlEt3/[Ph3C]+[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]− and [1-CrI(CO)4]+[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]−/AlEt3) that exhibited reasonably
high activity.43,44 Herein, avoiding the use of highly
reactive [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−, we prepared cationic CrIII complexes paired with common [B(C6F5)4]− anions, which showed high activity even
when activated with a common trialkylaluminum agent (Scheme 1).45 There have been several previous reports of cationic CrIII complexes paired with [B(C6F5)4]− anions. However, their preparations were not
targeted toward ethylene oligomerization.46−49

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of Cationic CrIII Complexes
Our synthetic strategy
for the targeted complexes ([(PNP)CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−) was to react [L4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (L = CH3CN or tetrahydrofuran (THF)) with PNP ligands
(Scheme 2a). The key
complex in this synthetic scheme, [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, was prepared by the metathesis
of CrCl3(THF)3 and [(CH3CN)4Ag]+[B(C6F5)4]− in acetonitrile. The silver complex, [(CH3CN)4Ag]+[B(C6F5)4]−, was easily prepared by reacting commercially available K+[B(C6F5)4]− with
AgNO3 in acetonitrile.50,51 In this work,
the molecular structure of the silver complex was unambiguously confirmed
by X-ray crystallography (Figure 1a).52 The key complex [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− was
isolated as green thin needle-shaped crystals, but the quality of
the crystals was unsatisfactory for X-ray crystallography. After replacing
the acetonitrile ligand with THF, pale pink-colored and needle-shaped
single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were obtained,
and its structure was elucidated to be that of the desired [(THF)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (Figure 1b). Wass et al. also reported the synthesis
of the related complex [(THF)4CrCl2]+[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]−, which was prepared by the reaction of CrCl2(THF)2 and [Cp2Fe]+[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]−.53

Scheme 2 Synthetic Scheme for the Target Complexes
When iPrN(PPh2)2 (1) was added
to a solution of [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− in CH2Cl2, the color of the
solution immediately changed from olive green to brown and eventually
became bluish-green after several hours. Bluish-green solids were
isolated almost quantitatively by trituration in hexane, but various
attempts to grow single crystals for X-ray crystallography were unsuccessful;
bluish-green oils were deposited in most cases. After replacing the
coordinating acetonitrile with THF, pale blue-colored and plate-shaped
single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were obtained,
the structure of which was elucidated to be that of the desired [1-CrCl2(THF)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (Figure 2a). Reacting 1 with THF adduct [(THF)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, even in a 1:1 mole ratio, with the aim of directly obtaining greenish
[1-CrCl2(THF)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− resulted in
the generation of a brown solution. X-ray crystallographic studies
of the isolated yellow, needle-shaped single crystals revealed their
structure to be that of the bis(PNP)CrIII complex [12-CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (Figure 2b). The THF adduct, [(THF)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, is sparingly soluble
in CH2Cl2, which is in contrast with the high
solubility of the acetonitrile adduct, [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, in CH2Cl2, and the reaction of 1 with [(THF)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, even in a 1:1 mole ratio,
afforded mainly the bis(PNP)CrIII complex, [12-CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, leaving half of the feed reactant,
[(THF)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, in the solid
phase. Similarly, it has been reported that reacting [(THF)4CrCl2]+[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]− with the PNP ligand does not afford the
mono(PNP)CrIII complex, but instead affords the bis(PNP)CrIII complex, [(PNP)2CrCl2]+[Al(OC(CF3)3)4]−.53 Whereas the bis(PNP)CrIII complex, [12-CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, is
soluble in hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, the mono(PNP)CrIII complex, [1-CrCl2L2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (L = THF or CH3CN), is insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents.
However, it is soluble in more polar chlorobenzene or CH2Cl2.

Aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents
(e.g., methylcyclohexane) are the
best options for commercial ethylene tetramerization. Hence, complexes
soluble in methylcyclohexane are desirable. A PNP ligand bearing long
alkyl chains ([CH3(CH2)16]2CHN(PPh2)2, 2 in Scheme 2) was prepared in good yield
(70%) by the conventional synthetic method, that is, reacting Ph2PCl with a long-chain alkyl amine [CH3(CH2)16]2CHNH2 in the presence of excess
triethylamine.29 The alkyl amine, [CH3(CH2)16]2CHNH2, was prepared from inexpensive 18-pentatricontanone ([CH3(CH2)16]2C=O).54,55 The long-chain PNP ligand is highly soluble in hexane. PNP ligand 2 was reacted with [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− in CH2Cl2. To minimize
(or avoid) generation of undesired bis(PNP)CrIII species,
the mole ratio of the reactants was set at 1:2. A green species was
extracted from the reaction mixture using hot methylcyclohexane (ca.
50 °C) while leaving [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, which remained owing to its addition in excess,
in the solid phase. The extracted species was assigned as the desired
mono(PNP)CrIII complex [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− on the basis of its green
color and elemental analysis data and was used for oligomerization
studies. The complex is clearly soluble in hot methylcyclohexane (ca.
50 °C), but the solution becomes turbid by the formation of a
dispersion of fine particles upon cooling to room temperature. It
is freely soluble in hydrocarbon solvents bearing π-electrons
such as toluene or cyclohexene, even at room temperature.

Preparation
of the cationic (PNP)CrIII complex containing
an ortho-dimethylaminobenzyl ligand instead of chloride
was attempted (Scheme 2b). The starting Cr-precursor, (o-Me2NC6H4CH2)3Cr, was prepared
by reacting CrCl3(THF)3 with o-Me2NC6H4CH2Li.56 The pure complex was isolated by recrystallization
in CH2Cl2 at −30 °C, and its molecular
structure was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 1c). When (o-Me2NC6H4CH2)3Cr was treated with [H(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− in CH2Cl2, the color of the solution immediately
changed from red to violet. In the 1H NMR spectrum, signals
assignable to o-Me2NC6H4CH3 are present, indicating the protonation of
the ortho-dimethylaminobenzyl ligand by the action
of [H(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (Figure S7 in Supporting information). The diethyl ether signals, which
are clearly observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of [H(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− in CD2Cl2 at 3.55
and 1.42 ppm, are absent, indicating that diethyl ether coordinates
to the paramagnetic CrIII center. On the basis of these
observations, the generated complex was assigned as [(o-Me2NC6H4CH2)2CrIII(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−. All attempts
to grow single crystals of this complex were unsuccessful and, furthermore,
the color of the solution changed during the recrystallization process,
indicating that it is unstable. Thus, PNP ligand 1 was
subsequently added to the CD2Cl2 solution containing
the unpurified [(o-Me2NC6H4CH2)2CrIII(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the signals
for 1 are absent, indicating the coordination of the
PNP ligand to the paramagnetic CrIII center (Figure S7). Broad diethyl ether signals are observed
at 3.78 and 1.54 ppm after overnight reaction. These observations
positively indicate the generation of the desired complex [1-Cr(CH2C6H4NMe2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−. Attempts to grow single crystals of this species
were also unsuccessful. Using the long-chain PNP ligand (2), a methylcyclohexane-soluble complex was prepared by the same procedure,
which was tentatively assigned as [2-Cr(CH2C6H4NMe2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− and
used for the oligomerization studies.

X-ray Crystallographic
Studies
Single crystals of [(CH3CN)4Ag]+[B(C6F5)4]− suitable for X-ray crystallography
were grown in acetonitrile solution at −30 °C. Tetrahedral
coordination of the CH3CN ligands to silver is observed
with no direct chemical bonding between [(CH3CN)4Ag]+ and [B(C6F5)4]− (Figure 2a). One Ag–N–C bond angle deviates significantly from
linearity (155.7(3)°), whereas the other three are almost linear
(170.1(3), 172.1(3), and 177.9(2)°). Single crystals of [(THF)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− were grown in THF at −30
°C after the acetonitrile ligands in [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− were replaced with
THF. The CrIII center adopts perfect octahedral geometry
surrounded by two chloride and four THF ligands (Figure 2b). The four THF ligands form
a plane with the Cr center, whereas the two chloride ligands are situated
at the axial sites in trans configuration. The oxygen atoms in THF
adopt sp2 hybridization, that is, the sum of bond angles
around O is 360°, indicating π-donation from O to the CrIII center. The structure of (o-Me2NC6H4CH2)3Cr is shown
in Figure 1c. The Cr
center adopts distorted octahedral geometry with facial arrangement
of three benzylic CH2 groups and three amine ligands. The
plain formed by the three carbon ligands is parallel to the plane
formed by the three nitrogen ligands (the angle between the C(1)–C(10)–C(19)
and N(1)–N(2)–N(3) planes, 0.90(6)°), and the benzylic
CH2 ligand is widely exposed, making it very accessible
for the attack by [H(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−.

Figure 2 shows the structures
of the mono(PNP)CrIII complex, [1-CrCl2(THF)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, and bis(PNP)CrIII complex,
[12-CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−. Both complexes
exhibit distorted octahedral coordination. The PNP and the two THF
ligands form a plane with the CrIII center (the angle between
the P–Cr–P and O–Cr–O planes, 4.02(9)°)
in the former case, and the two PNP ligands form a rather distorted
plane with the CrIII center in the latter case (the angle
between the P(1)–Cr–P(2) and P(3)–Cr–P(4)
planes, 8.52(7)°). The two chlorides occupy the axial sites almost
linearly (the Cl–Cr–Cl angles, 179.59(7) and 171.97(9)°).
In both cases, the sum of the bond angles around the nitrogen atom
in the PNP ligand is 360°, which indicates the delocalization
of the nitrogen lone pair through phosphorous atoms by adopting sp2-hybridization. The sum of the bond angles around the oxygen
atom in THF is 360°, indicating π-donation from the O to
the CrIII center by adopting sp2-hybridization.
The Cr–OTHF distances are elongated in [1-CrCl2(THF)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− when compared to those in
[(THF)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (average 2.042 vs 2.003
Å)

Ethylene Tetramerization Studies
As shown in Table 1, the [(PNP)CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− complexes were screened
for ethylene oligomerization after activation with trialkylaluminum
agents (Me3Al, Et3Al, or iBu3Al)
with the expectation that the trialkylaluminum would replace the chloride
ligands with alkyl groups (i.e., Me, Et, or iBu) and abstract the
acetonitrile ligands to generate vacant sites for ethylene coordination,
thus generating the active species necessary for the catalytic cycle
involving cationic CrI/III species. As expected, the [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Me3Al (Al/Cr, 300) catalytic system shows high activity (155
kg/g-Cr/h) in chlorobenzene, in which [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− is soluble, with reasonable
selectivity (1-hexene 42%, 1-octene 44%, PE 2.2%; entry 1). As anticipated,
the catalytic system based on the bis(PNP)Cr complex, that is, [12-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Me3Al, shows low activity (50 kg/g-Cr/h, entry 2). The
use of Me3Al is not preferable to the use of MAO because
the price of MAO is elevated mainly by the high cost of Me3Al. The use of Et3Al or iBu3Al instead of Me3Al lowers the activity (74 and 126 kg/g-Cr/h, respectively)
and resulted in the formation of a significant amount of PE (ca. 10%,
entries 3 and 4). We attributed these unsatisfactory results to incomplete
alkylation, owing to the lower reactivity of Et3Al and
iBu3Al compared to that of Me3Al. When a small
proportion of Me3Al (30 μmol, Al/Cr = 20) is admixed
with Et3Al (420 μmol), the activity becomes even
higher (288 kg/g-Cr/h) than that observed for [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Me3Al (entry
5). The selectivity of this improved system is also satisfactory,
with formation of only a negligible amount of PE (0.7%). Similar improvement
is also achieved avoiding the use of any Me3Al using Et3Al or iBu3Al alone and allowing 1 h activation
time. Thus, the activities (224 and 221 kg/g-Cr/h, entries 6 and 7)
become comparable to those of the system containing MAO, that is,
[1-CrCl3]/MAO (203 kg/g-Cr/h, entry 8) when
[1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− is used after activation with Et3Al or iBu3Al for 1 h. The selectivity is also similar to that observed with
[1-CrCl3]/MAO, generating only a small amount
of PE (1%).

b Modified MAO sourced
from Akzo Nobel
(MMAO-3A 7.0 Al wt % in heptane).

Aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, for example, methylcyclohexane,
are reported to be the best choice for the ethylene oligomerization
reaction considering their boiling point and safety. Upon changing
the solvent from chlorobenzene to methylcyclohexane, in which [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− is
insoluble, the activity of [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al (or iBu3Al)
becomes unsatisfactorily low (13 and 26 kg/g-Cr/h, entries 10 and
11). However, [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, which bears long alkyl chains on the PNP ligand and
hence is soluble in methylcyclohexane, exhibits satisfactory activity
when activated with Et3Al or iBu3Al (77 and
84 kg/g-Cr/h, entries 12 and 13). The activity achieved is ca. 50%
that is attained with the original MAO-based Sasol system (1/Cr(acac)3/MAO) under otherwise identical conditions (163
kg/g-Cr/h, entry 16). Furthermore, the performance of this catalytic
system exhibits negligible deactivation over the rather long reaction
time of 1.5 h; the ethylene consumption and hence the productivity
increase almost linearly with time and reach 134 kg/g-Cr by running
the oligomerization for 1.5 h (entry 14, Figure 3a). Another advantage of this system is that
unwanted side products above C10 (labeled as “>C10”
labeled in Table 1)
were lowered (ca. 9 vs 13%) by the use of [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/iBu3Al
(or Et3Al) instead of 1/Cr(acac)3/MAO, even though the 1-hexene/1-octene ratio becomes higher (14/70
vs 8/73). Coproduction of 1-hexene and 1-octene is an acceptable option
in industry, and the higher 1-hexene/1-octene ratio is not a critical
disadvantage. Another type of cationic Cr complex paired with the
[B(C6F5)4]− anion,
[2-Cr(CH2C6H4NMe2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, shows negligible activity when activated
with Et3Al or iBu3Al. It shows low activity
when activated with more Lewis acidic tetraisobutylaluminoxane (iBu2Al)2O (29 kg/g-Cr/h, entry 15).

Figure 3 Ethylene consumption
vs time monitored by a mass-flow controller
(MFC) in the tetramerization reaction performed in methylcyclohexane
(a) or cyclohexene (b) using [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/iBu3Al or Et3Al.

The performance of [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− was also studied
in π-electron-bearing
solvents such as toluene and cyclohexene, in which it is freely soluble.
By changing the methylcyclohexane solvent to toluene, the activity
of [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/iBu3Al is somewhat lowered to 65 kg/g-Cr/h (entry 17).
The same trend was also observed in the original MAO-based Sasol system;
the activity drops by half upon changing the methylcyclohexane solvent
to toluene.29 However, the activity of
[2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/iBu3Al almost doubles by changing the methylcyclohexane
solvent to cyclohexene (84 vs 168 kg/g-Cr/h, entries 13 and 18). The
activity achieved in cyclohexene is almost identical to that of the
original MAO-based Sasol system (1/Cr(acac)3 MAO) in methylcyclohexane (168 vs 163 kg/g-Cr/h). The same high
activity is attained when activator iBu3Al is replaced
with the more common and cheaper Et3Al (entry 19) and,
moreover, the catalyst deactivation is negligible over the course
of 1 h oligomerization (entry 20, Figure 3b). The π bond in cyclohexene does
not participate in product formation; no additional signals are observed
in the gas chromatography (GC) chart with the use of cyclohexene instead
of methylcyclohexane (Figures S2 and S3). The formation of slightly fewer unwanted side products >C10
(5.3–8.0%)
and formation of negligible amounts of PE (0.1–0.3%) are other
advantages observed for the use of cyclohexene. Cyclohexene is an
inexpensive and abundant chemical currently used in industry on a
large scale, and its boiling point is different from those
of the products 1-hexene and 1-octene (83, 63, and 121 °C, respectively),
facilitating separation of products and solvent. Hence, it may be
possible to use cyclohexene as the solvent in the ethylene tetramerization
process. Interestingly, the MAO-based original Sasol system also showed
1.6 times higher activity in cyclohexene than in methylcyclohexane,
which was originally reported to be the best choice of solvent (257
vs 163 kg/g-Cr/h, entry 21).

The activities of [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al (or iBu3Al) achieved
in this work (89 and 168 kg/g-Cr/h in methylcyclohexane and cyclohexene,
respectively) are significantly higher than that previously reported
for 1/CrCl3(THF)3/[Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al (2.5 kg/g-Cr/h).42 The
low activity in the latter case was attributed to the destruction
of [B(C6F5)4]− anions
by the action of Et3Al; [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]− was reported
to react with trialkylaluminum, with the [B(C6F5)4]− anion being fragmented. We believe
that this instability is triggered by the reaction of the trialkylaluminum
reagent with the trityl cation ([Ph3C]+), not
by the reaction with the [B(C6F5)4]− anion itself.42,57 The 19F NMR signals were monitored to investigate the stability of the
[B(C6F5)4]− anion
(Figure 4). In the 19F NMR spectra of [(CH3CN)4Ag]+[B(C6F5)4]−, [(CH3CN)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, and [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, a set of −C6F5 signals are clearly observed at −132
(ortho), −161 to −163 (para), and −164 to −167
(meta) ppm (Figure 4a,b). In the 19F NMR spectrum of [1-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/iBu3Al
(Al/Cr, 20) in chlorobenzene-d5, only
the ortho-signal at −133 ppm is observed (Figure 4c); the signals for the para- and meta-fluorine are absent, possibly
due to interaction with the paramagnetic CrIII center.
The stability of the [B(C6F5)4]− anion itself in the presence of iBu3Al
is further indicated by the clear presence of a set of −C6F5 signals alone at −134, −157, and
−162 ppm for [Li]+[B(C6F5)4]−/iBu3Al (Al/Li, 20) in chlorobenzene-d5 (Figure 4d). In this study, [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]− is not used
with the trialkylaluminum reagent, but cationic Cr complexes paired
with [B(C6F5)4]− anions were prepared by an alternative route. By avoiding the use
of [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−, an efficient catalytic system containing
[B(C6F5)4]− anions
may be realized.

Conclusions
Cationic (PNP)CrIII complexes
paired with [B(C6F5)4]− anion ([(PNP)CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, where PNP is iPrN(PPh2)2 (1)
or [CH3(CH2)16]2CHN(PPh2)2 (2)) were prepared using [(CH3CN)4CrIIICl2]+[B(C6F5)4]−. The
cationic (PNP)CrIII complexes paired with [B(C6F5)4]− anions [(PNP)CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− showed high activities
in ethylene tetramerization
reactions performed in chlorobenzene, even when activated with common
trialkylaluminum reagents (Et3Al and iBu3Al),
thus avoiding the use of expensive MAO. Both the activity and selectivity
were comparable to those of the original MAO-based Sasol system (1-CrCl3/MAO). When the PNP ligand is modified with
long alkyl chains, the cationic (PNP)CrIII complex paired
with [B(C6F5)4]− anions, that is, [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−, activated with Et3Al or iBu3Al showed high activity in the more desirable aliphatic hydrocarbon
solvent methylcyclohexane (89 kg/g-Cr/h) and, moreover, showed much
higher (2 times) activity in cyclohexene (168 kg/g-Cr/h), which is
as high as that exhibited by the original MAO-based Sasol system (1/Cr(acac)3/MAO) in methylcyclohexane (163 kg/g-Cr/h).
Further advantages exhibited by the catalytic system, [2-CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al, in cyclohexene were negligible catalyst deactivation, the formation
of a negligible amount of PE (0.3%), and the formation of lower amounts
of unwanted side products above C10. The [B(C6F5)4]− anion is destroyed when [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]− reacts with common trialkylaluminum. Consequently,
catalytic system 1/CrCl3(THF)3/[Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al failed. However, the [B(C6F5)4]− anion in itself is
compatible with trialkylaluminum once it is not paired with a trityl
cation; thus, [(PNP)CrCl2(CH3CN)2]+[B(C6F5)4]−/Et3Al (or iB3Al) exhibited high activity.

methylene chloride (2 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of [(CH3CN)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (0.220 g, 0.228 mmol)
in methylene chloride (3 mL). Upon addition, the color of the solution
changed immediately from olive green to bluish-green and finally became
green after 3 h. After stirring for 3 h, the volatiles were removed
under vacuum. The residue was redissolved in methylene chloride (3
mL) and all volatiles were completely removed to obtain a bluish-green
residue. Methylcyclohexane (10 mL) was added, and the product was
dissolved by heating to ca. 50 °C using a heat gun. The solution
was filtered through Celite while it was hot. The solvent was then
removed under vacuum, and the residue was redissolved in hot methylcyclohexane
(10 mL). The solution was again filtered through Celite at ca. 50
°C to remove any insoluble impurities. Removing the solvent under
vacuum afforded a greenish waxy solid (0.147 g, 73%). Anal. Calcd

(o-Me2NC6H4CH2)3Cr56
n-BuLi
(2.5 M in hexane, 10.3 g, 37.2 mmol) was
added to a solution of N,N-dimethyl-o-toluidine (5.00 g, 37.0 mmol) in a mixture of hexane (20
mL) and diethyl ether (10 mL). After stirring overnight at 45 °C,
the generated solids were isolated by filtration. The isolated pale
yellow solid (2-dimethylaminobenzyllithium, 4.23 g, 30.0 mmol, 81%)
was dissolved in THF (30 mL), and the resulting solution was added
to a stirred suspension of CrCl3(THF)3 (3.74
g, 9.98 mmol) in THF (30 mL) at −78 °C. Upon stirring
at −78 °C for 1 h, the color of the solution changed from
bright purple to dark orange. The reaction mixture was then warmed
to room temperature and stirred overnight. The color of the solution
changed from dark orange to dark red. The solvent was removed under
vacuum to obtain the solids that were washed with diethyl ether (60
mL). Methylene chloride (100 mL) was added to dissolve the product,
and insoluble byproducts were removed by filtration. The solvent was
removed under vacuum to obtain a red solid (3.31 g, 73%). The product
was further purified by recrystallization from methylene chloride
at −30 °C.

A solution of [H(OEt2)2]+[B(C6F5)4]− (0.183 g, 0.221 mmol) in methylene chloride
(0.5 mL)
was added dropwise to a solution of (o-Me2NC6H4CH2)3Cr (0.100 g,
0.220 mmol) in methylene chloride (3 mL). Upon addition, the color
of the solution changed immediately from dark red to violet. After
stirring for 1 h, a solution of [CH3(CH2)16]2CHN(PPh2)2 (0.193 g, 0.220
mmol) in methylene chloride (2 mL) was added dropwise. Upon addition,
the color of the solution changed immediately from violet to dark
orange and became green after stirring overnight. All volatiles were
removed under vacuum. Methylcyclohexane (10 mL) was added, and the
product was dissolved by heating to 50 °C with a heat gun. The
solution was filtered through Celite while hot. Removing the solvent
under vacuum afforded a greenish waxy solid (0.280 g, 68%), which
was used for the oligomerization studies without further purification
and characterization.

Typical Procedure for Ethylene Oligomerization
(Entry 19 in Table 1)
In a glove
box, a dried 75 mL bomb reactor was charged with cyclohexene (19 mL)
and Et3Al (0.450 mmol). The reactor was assembled and removed
from the glove box. The reactor was then heated to 35 °C using
an oil bath. The chromium complex (1.5 μmol) dissolved in cyclohexene
(1 mL) was injected into the reactor using a syringe. Ethylene gas
(45 bar) was immediately fed into the reactor. The temperature immediately
increased to 45 °C owing to the generated heat. Ethylene consumption
was monitored using a MFC under a constant pressure of 45 bar. After
conducting the oligomerization at 45 °C for 30 min, the reactor
was cooled with an ice bath and the ethylene gas was vented off. Ethanol
(2 mL), aqueous HCl (10%, 2 mL), and nonane (0.700 g) as an internal
standard for GC analysis were successively added. The organic upper
layer was taken for GC analysis.

X-ray Crystallography
Reflection data were collected
at 100 K on a Bruker APEX II CCD area diffractometer using graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.7107 Å). Specimens of suitable
quality and size were selected, mounted, and centered in the X-ray
beam with the aid of a video camera. The hemisphere of the reflection
data was collected as φ and ω scan frames at 0.5°/frame
and an exposure time of 10 s/frame. The cell parameters were determined
and refined using the SMART program. Data reduction was performed
using SAINT software. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization
effects. An empirical absorption correction was applied using the
SADABS program. The structures of the compounds were solved by direct
methods and refined by full matrix least-squares methods using the
SHELXTL program package with anisotropic thermal parameters for all
nonhydrogen atoms. Crystallographic data have been deposited with
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. Crystallographic data
