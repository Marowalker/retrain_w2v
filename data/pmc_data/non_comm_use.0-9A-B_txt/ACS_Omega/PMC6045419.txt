Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs)
are drug delivery agents
that are able to incorporate drugs within their pores. Furthermore,
MSNs can be functionalized by attachment of bioactive ligands on their
surface to enhance their activity, and nanoparticles modified with
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetics inhibit the entry of herpes simplex
virus (HSV) into cells. In this study, structure–activity relationships
of GAGs attached to MSNs were investigated in relation to HSV-1 and
HSV-2, and acyclovir was loaded into the pores of MSNs. The sulfonate
group was demonstrated to be essential for antiviral activity, which
was enhanced by incorporating a benzene group within the ligand. Loading
acyclovir into GAG mimetic-functionalized MSNs reduced the viral infection,
resulting in nanoparticles that simultaneously target two distinct
viral pathways, namely, inhibition of viral entry and inhibition of
DNA replication.

Introduction
Herpes simplex virus
(HSV) causes numerous infectious diseases
including orolabial herpes and genital herpes.1 In the clinic, these infections are currently managed symptomatically
using guanine analogues such as acyclovir, valaciclovir, and famciclovir,
which inhibit viral DNA replication.1 There
have been no further major advances in the pharmacotherapy of HSV
infections since the discovery of guanine analogues in the late 1970s.2,3 Guanine analogues are unable to eradicate viruses from the host
following primary infection, with the HSV prevalence remaining high
globally.3

Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 initiate
infection of cells by interacting
with receptors on the cell surface that mediate viral entry.4,5 The initial interaction is believed to be due to the electrostatic
and hydrophobic interaction of viral glycoprotein (gB or gC) with
host cell glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (e.g., heparan sulfate) composed
of negatively charged sulfonate groups linked by hydrophobic moieties.4−8 Shukla et al. determined that heparan sulfate modified by 3-O-sulfotransferases may also be involved in the subsequent
step of viral entry, virus fusion with cell membrane, by binding to
HSV-1 gD.9 HS is therefore also involved
in the latter stages of viral entry of HSV, similar to the entry mechanism
of human immunodeficiency virus.10 Molecules
that mimic GAGs can inhibit HSV entry into cells; hence, GAG mimetics
have the potential to become a new class of antiviral agent for prophylaxis
of HSV infections.11,12

There is great interest
in nanoparticles as drug delivery agents
because of their many favorable properties including a high surface
area-to-volume ratio, which can support high concentrations of bioactive
ligands on their surface whilst maintaining a small volume.13 Using silver, gold, and albumin nanoparticles,
the antiviral activity of simple alkyl sulfonate GAG mimetics against
HSV-1 was substantially enhanced.14−16 In our recent study,
an aryl sulfonate GAG mimetic-functionalized onto mesoporous silica
nanoparticles (MSNs) was demonstrated to have low toxicity and inhibit
the entry of HSV-1 and HSV-2 into susceptible cells, whereas unfunctionalized
MSNs and the GAG mimetic alone were inactive.17 However, an investigation into the structure–activity relationship
(SAR) of functional groups attached to MSNs in the context of anti-HSV
activity has not been explored. Hence, in this study, we modified
MSNs with various functional groups related to the GAG structure and
investigated their SARs against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection of susceptible
cells. MSNs were selected as the drug delivery vehicle because their
highly ordered mesoporous interior and large pore volume (0.6–1
cm3 g–1) can accommodate large amounts
of loaded drugs, even exceeding 30 wt %.18 This distinguishing and valuable feature of MSNs, combined with
their thermal stability, mechanical resilience, and surface silanol
groups that enable facile attachment of organic groups, has enabled
the development of highly sophisticated multifunctional drug delivery
systems for various diseases.19,20

In the second
part of this study, we explored MSNs loaded with
acyclovir and functionalized with a GAG mimetic to simultaneously
target two distinct viral pathways, namely, inhibition of viral entry
and inhibition of DNA replication (Figure 1). Silicon-based materials have previously
been used to load acyclovir, and their drug release properties were
studied.21,22 However, to the extent of our knowledge,
this is the first time that acyclovir has been loaded into GAG mimetic-functionalized
MSNs. Such multifunctional systems that act on more than one viral
target may slow down the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Furthermore,
loading acyclovir into MSNs may help to improve its delivery because
it suffers from poor oral bioavailability and topical preparations
have poor penetration to the dermis, leading to inadequate response
in the treatment of orolabial herpes.23 Indeed, nanoparticles other than MSNs have been used to improve
the delivery of acyclovir for the treatment of HSV infections such
as orolabial herpes,23 genital herpes,24 and ocular keratitis.25,26 For example, acyclovir-loaded polymeric nanoparticles have demonstrated
increased potency compared to the free drug, possibly because of the
intracellular uptake of the nanoparticles and subsequent release of
the loaded drug.27

Figure 1 Proposed multifunctional
MSNs that are able to bind to extracellular
HSV via the GAG mimetic to inhibit viral entry and inhibit intracellular
processes of viral infection by blocking viral DNA replication through
the release of acyclovir.

Herein, we report the SARs of GAG mimetic-functionalized
MSNs in
relation to HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection of susceptible cells. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the dual mechanism of action against HSV-1 and HSV-2
by GAG mimetic-functionalized MSNs loaded with acyclovir (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of MSNs (1)
MSNs (1) were synthesized
by the base-catalyzed hydrolysis–condensation
reaction of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in ethanol with cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) as the structure-directing agent using a protocol adapted
from Kim et al.28 The nanoparticles (1) were generally well-dispersed (Table S1), providing a greater available surface area for functionalization.
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the MSNs (1) were subsequently functionalized
with GAG mimetics (3, 5, and 6) or groups that are structurally related to GAG mimetics (4 and 7) to elucidate SARs.

Benzene Sulfonate-Functionalized
MSNs (3)
Using a method derived from our previous
study,17 MSNs (1) were functionalized
with sodium benzene
sulfonate at various degrees of functionalization (DFs) to form nanoparticles
of 100–150 nm in diameter (MSN-phenyl-SO3) (3) (Figure 2A). This GAG mimetic was selected because it is the simplest form
of aromatic sulfonate and MSNs functionalized with this group were
previously demonstrated to inhibit the entry of HSV into susceptible
cells.17 The morphology of the nanoparticles
was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their
size was estimated using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The zeta
potentials of all three analogues of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) in aqueous suspension were less than −40 mV, which
is likely to confer good colloidal stability because of the interparticle
repulsion.29 The density of the attached
sodium benzene sulfonate group was varied by changing the concentration
of 2-(4-chlorosulfonylphenyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane (CSPTMS) during
the preparation of the intermediate sulfonyl chloride (2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to measure the change
in the weight of a sample of compound as it was heated to 900 °C.
The silica material undergoes insignificant weight loss with temperatures
up to 900 °C; hence, the weight loss recorded by TGA was attributed
to the loss of the attached functional group and was used to estimate
the DF in units of weight %. The results indicated that MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) systems with DFs of 11.7, 4.3, and 1.1 w/w
% were successfully prepared (Figure S1A).

Figure 2 TEM images (A) and high-resolution S 2p XPS spectra (B) of spherical
MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) with (a) DF 1.1 w/w %;
(b) DF 4.3 w/w %; and (c) DF 11.7 w/w %. DLS measurements showing
the hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential
in type II water are included. The scale bar represents 100 nm.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to characterize
the attached functional group of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3). The low-resolution XPS spectra confirmed the presence
of key peaks such as Si, C, S, and Na (Figure S1B). The high-resolution peak of S 2p was observed at ca.
168 eV for all three analogues of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) (Figure 2B), which signified the presence of the sulfonate form of sulfur.
Moreover, 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) (DF 11.7 w/w %) revealed key carbon peaks
such as C–Si and aromatic carbons, which confirmed the successful
functionalization reaction (Figure S1C).

Propyl Thiol (4)- and Propyl Sulfonate (5)-Functionalized MSNs
MSNs were also functionalized with
the propyl sulfonate group (MSN-propyl-SO3) (5) by a two-step reaction involving the initial preparation of a propyl
thiol intermediate (MSN-propyl-thiol) (4). MSN-propyl-thiol
(4) (Figure 3A(a))) had a spherical morphology with sizes similar to those
of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) (Figure 2A). The XPS spectra of MSN-propyl-thiol (4) revealed a peak at 163 eV corresponding to the thiol group
(Figure 3B(a)).

Figure 3 TEM images
(A) and high-resolution S 2p XPS spectra (B) of spherical
nanoparticles: (a) MSN-thiol (4) (DF 10.7 w/w %); (b)
MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) (DF 2.4 w/w %); and (c)
MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) (DF 5.0 w/w %). DLS measurements
determining the hydrodynamic diameter, PDI, and zeta potential in
type II water are included. The scale bar represents 100 nm.

MSN-propyl-thiol (4) with a DF of 10.7 w/w % was then
oxidized to form MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) with two
different DFs, 2.4 and 5.0 w/w % (Figure S2A), and the particle size and morphology were unchanged (Figure 3A(b,c)). This GAG
mimetic was selected because the benzene group of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) is replaced with an alkyl group, which can
therefore be used to compare the impact of aromatic and hydrophobic
interactions on antiviral activity. On the basis of the XPS spectra,
the oxidation of thiol (4) to sulfonate (5) led to the shift of the S 2p peak from ca. 163 eV (Figure 3B(a)) to 168 eV (Figure 3B(b,c)), which is indicative
of the complete conversion of the thiol groups to the sulfonate form. 13C SSNMR spectra of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) with a DF of 5.0 w/w % revealed signals for aliphatic carbons,
which is consistent with an aliphatic sulfonate (Figure S2C). Oxidation decreased the weight % of the functional
group from 10.7 to 5.0 and 2.4 w/w % despite the higher molecular
weight of the propyl sulfonate group (5), compared to
the propyl thiol group (4). This indicates the possible
detachment of organic groups from the surface of MSNs during the oxidation
process, a phenomenon that was observed previously on oxidized silica
surfaces.30

Zwitterionic Sulfonate-Functionalized
MSNs (6)
The anionic sulfonate group is believed
to be critical for binding
to the basic amino acid residues of HSV glycoproteins via electrostatic
interactions. To investigate the effect of incorporating a positively
charged group alongside a sulfonate moiety, a zwitterionic compound
comprising both quaternary ammonium and sulfonate groups was functionalized
onto the MSNs. As illustrated in Figure S3A, the MSNs functionalized with the zwitterionic compound (MSN-Zw-SO3) (6) had a size and morphology similar to those
of the other functionalized nanoparticles (3–5). Despite the attachment of a zwitterionic functional group with
a DF of 9.9 w/w % (Figure S3B), the zeta
potential was negatively charged, possibly because of the contribution
of the negatively charged silanol groups (Figure S3A). XPS detected the sulfonate group and nitrogen atom (Figure S3C,D), and the 13C SSNMR spectrum
(Figure S3E) was consistent with the structure
of 6. However, the sodium counterion was not detected
in the samples despite the presence of the sulfonate group and stirring
the nanoparticles in aqueous NaCl solution (10 w/v %) twice for 2
h. This suggests that the sulfonate group may form a stable intramolecular
salt with the quaternary ammonium group, thus hindering the conversion
of the sulfonate to the sodium salt.

Phenyl-Functionalized MSNs
(7)
A one-step
procedure afforded MSNs functionalized with a hydrophobic phenyl group
(MSN-phenyl) (7). Similar to the other compounds, MSN-phenyl
(7) formed spherical particles of 100–150 nm in
diameter, and DLS revealed PDI and zeta potential values similar to
those of other types of functionalized particles (Figure S4A). The negative charge of MSN-phenyl (7) indicates that, similar to MSN-Zw-SO3 (6), the nanoparticles probably contain a substantial amount of silanol
groups. Nonetheless, TGA revealed the successful attachment of the
phenyl group to the MSN surface with an approximate weight loss (DF)
of 6.8 w/w % (Figure S4B). Furthermore,
XPS showed strong intensity of the carbon peak without the appearance
of other elemental peaks (Figure S4C).
The high-resolution C 1s spectra revealed a broad peak between 290
and 295 eV corresponding to the aromatic carbons (Figure S4D). This was confirmed by the 13C SSNMR
spectra which identified aromatic carbons linked to the silica nanoparticles
via a Si–C bond (Figure S4E).

SARs of Functionalized MSNs
The antiviral activity
of the functionalized MSNs toward HSV-1 and HSV-2 was evaluated using
a plaque reduction assay. Plaques are visible disruptions of the cell
monolayer formed following the infection of cells by viruses such
as HSV. Hence, the effectiveness of an antiviral agent can be evaluated
based on its ability to reduce the formation of plaques, quantified
by the percent reduction of the plaque number relative to the untreated
control (% viral inhibition). Different concentrations of nanoparticles
were used to test the antiviral activity of 3 and 5 against HSV-1 (208 μg/mL nanoparticles) and HSV-2
(52 μg/mL nanoparticles). These concentrations provided strong
antiviral activity without causing complete (100%) inhibition. If
equal concentrations of nanoparticles were used to evaluate the activity
against both HSV-1 and HSV-2, all analogues of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5)
may have shown extremely high viral inhibition of HSV-2 or extremely
low inhibition of HSV-1, which would make comparisons of different
nanoparticles difficult.

To study the antiviral activity, the
functionalized nanoparticles were initially incubated with the viral
suspension for 1 h before being inoculated to Vero cells. All analogues
of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) displayed antiviral activity against HSV-1
and HSV-2 (Figure 4A,B). For both HSV-1 and HSV-2, the absolute antiviral response was
greater for MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) than MSN-propyl-SO3 (5). Furthermore, when the antiviral activities
of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) of similar weight % of attached functional
group were compared; MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) (DF
4.3 w/w %) had a statistically greater antiviral effect against both
HSV-1 and HSV-2 compared to MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) (DF 5.0 w/w %) (p < 0.05; two-tailed paired t-test) (3: 86% HSV-1 inhibition and 92% HSV-2
inhibition and 5: 28% HSV-1 inhibition and 34% HSV-2
inhibition). The two compounds had similar physical properties such
as morphology, PDI, and zeta potential; hence, these results indicate
that the benzene group of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) enhances the antiviral activity in comparison to the propyl group
of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5). Alternatively, if MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) were to be compared based on the number of attached functional
groups, instead of similar weight % of attached group, the difference
in antiviral activity would probably be even greater because benzene
sulfonate has a higher molecular weight than propyl sulfonate. The
higher antiviral response against HSV observed for MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) can be attributed to the greater hydrophobicity
of 3 due to the presence of the phenyl group. Previous
studies have demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic groups in
relation to anti-HSV activity. Jenssen et al. demonstrated that introducing
two hydrophobic residues into a cationic peptide increased its binding
to the GAG, heparan sulfate,4 whereas Trybala
et al. demonstrated that replacing either of the two hydrophobic amino
acids with threonine in the peptide mimicking the binding site of
gC substantially reduced the binding to heparan sulfate and infectivity.7 Dendrimers capped with the more hydrophobic naphthalene
sulfonate groups were significantly more potent at inhibiting HSV-2
infection of human embryonic lung cells than dendrimers with phenyl
sulfonate groups.8 Moreover, increasing
the degree of sulfation also increased the activity.8

Figure 4 Antiviral activity of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) of varying DFs on
(A) HSV-1 (208 μg/mL nanoparticles) and (B) HSV-2 (52 μg/mL
nanoparticles). (C) Antiviral activity of MSN-phenyl (7) (DF 6.8 w/w %) (417 μg/mL nanoparticles) and MSN-propyl-thiol
(4) (DF 10.7 w/w %) (417 μg/mL nanoparticles) on
HSV-1 and HSV-2. The antiviral activity was studied using a plaque
reduction assay. Viral inhibition (%) was determined by the percent
reduction of plaque numbers compared to the untreated control. The
values are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with
duplicate wells per treatment.

An apparent concentration–response relationship was
established
for MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3), with the maximal effect
occurring for nanoparticles at a relatively low DF of 4.3 w/w %. However,
increasing the DF of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) from
2.4 to 5.0 w/w % did not increase the antiviral effect (p > 0.05; two-tailed t-test), based on the two
densities
that were studied. When the concentrations of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) were doubled from 208 to 416 μg/mL for HSV-1
and from 52 to 104 μg/mL for HSV-2, although a higher antiviral
activity was observed, the antiviral response again did not increase
with the DF (p > 0.05; two-tailed t-test) (Figure S5). This suggests that
the maximum antiviral activity of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) was achieved at a DF equal to or lower than 2.4 w/w %.
This value is much lower than the density required to achieve a maximum
response with MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3). However,
the absolute response of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) was much greater than that of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) despite the response of MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) reaching a plateau at a lower weight % of functional group
than that of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3).

Both
MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) displayed an antiviral activity, so to determine
the effect of the sulfonate group on the activity, analogues that
lacked this group were synthesized. In the case of MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3), a phenyl analogue (MSN-phenyl 7, DF 6.8 w/w %) was made, and for MSN-propyl-SO3 (5), a propyl thiol analogue (MSN-propyl-thiol 4, DF 10.7 w/w %) was prepared. In the plaque reduction assay, a higher
concentration of these functionalized nanoparticles was used in comparison
to previous experiments (417 μg/mL 4 and 7 for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 compared with 208 μg/mL used
for 3 and 5 previously) to give the compounds
an ample opportunity to exert an antiviral effect. MSN-phenyl (7) displayed a weak antiviral activity toward both virus subtypes,
whereas MSN-propyl-thiol (4) did not reduce the formation
of plaques (Figure 4C). Therefore, a sulfonate group (3 and 5),14−17 but not a thiol group (4), endows the nanoparticles
with a strong antiviral activity, and an aryl sulfonate (3) is more active than an alkyl sulfonate (5) (Figure 4). Negative viral
inhibition was observed for MSN-propyl-thiol (4), which
means that the cells incubated with the compound had higher plaque
numbers than the untreated control. The reason for this observation,
which suggests an increase in the efficiency of virus attachment/absorption,
is unknown. It may be speculated that MSN-thiol (4) may
increase the local concentration of viruses at the cell membrane or
alternatively affect the cell or viral membrane to promote fusion.

These results demonstrate the importance of the negatively charged
sulfonate group for anti-HSV activity. Next, we investigated whether
attaching a zwitterionic functional group, comprised of a cationic
quaternary ammonium group and a sulfonate group, onto MSNs confers
antiviral activity to MSN-Zw-SO3 (6). MSN-Zw-SO3 (6) (DF 9.9 w/w %) was unable to exert antiviral
activity on HSV-1 and HSV-2, even at concentrations two-fold greater
than the concentrations used to previously study MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) and MSN-propyl-SO3 (5) (Figure 5). As described
above, the sulfonate group of MSN-Zw-SO3 (6) may form an intramolecular ionic bond with the quaternary ammonium
group, thus diminishing the antiviral response.

Figure 5 Antiviral activity of
MSN-Zw-SO3 (6) (DF
9.9 w/w %) against HSV-1 (208 and 417 μg/mL nanoparticles) and
HSV-2 (52 and 104 μg/mL nanoparticles) using a plaque reduction
assay. Viral inhibition (%) was determined by the percent reduction
of plaque numbers compared to the untreated control. The values are
the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with duplicate
wells per treatment.

In accordance with our previous results,17 unfunctionalized MSNs (1) did not reduce the
formation
of plaques of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Figure S6). Therefore, the antiviral activity of nanoparticles observed in
this study can be attributed to the action of the attached functional
groups, with an aryl sulfonate (3) being optimal for
antiviral activity amongst the series of tested compounds (3–7).

Our previous study17 and related
studies14−16 determined that aryl and alkyl sulfonate groups attached
to nanoparticles
have low toxicity to cells. Forming MSNs is also likely to reduce
the toxicity relative to solid silica nanoparticles because of the
decreased number of outer surface silanol groups.17,31 The nanoparticles are unlikely to have interfered with the plaque
reduction assays because the concentrations (52–417 μg/mL)
and cell incubation time (2 h) were much lower than those in the conditions
used to undertake cell toxicity studies (1000 μg/mL and 48 h).17

Preparation of GAG Mimetic-Functionalized
MSNs Loaded with Acyclovir
Nanoparticles functionalized with
GAG mimetics prevent HSV infection
by inhibiting viral entry.14−17 In addition to providing a stable scaffold for surface
functionalization, a unique property of MSNs is that their pores can
be loaded with large amounts of drug(s), which widens the therapeutic
scope of MSNs.18 In this study, we prepared
MSNs functionalized with sodium benzene sulfonate and loaded with
acyclovir, which is a first-line drug for HSV infection. This created
multifunctional MSNs, which in principle could inhibit HSV infection
in two ways: (1) extracellularly, via inhibition of viral entry by
the GAG mimetic, and (2) intracellularly, via the inhibition of viral
DNA replication by acyclovir (Figure 1).

Functionalizing MSNs with high densities of
functional groups can cause narrowing of pore openings and impede
drug loading.32 Hence, MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) (DF 6.9 w/w %) (Figure 6A) was chosen for loading with acyclovir
because, according to earlier results, this would afford strong inhibition
of viral entry (Figure 4A), whilst a relatively low DF of phenyl-SO3 (3) (DF 6.9 w/w %) was predicted to be less likely to impede drug loading.
To load acyclovir, MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) was
first stirred in a concentrated solution of acyclovir in type II pure
water for 48 h to allow acyclovir to deposit inside the mesopores
of MSN-phenyl-SO3. The solvent was then evaporated in vacuo
to encourage further deposition of the drug into the mesopores, resulting
in the formation of ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3. TGA revealed a
high drug loading of 34.0 w/w % (Figure 6A). Free acyclovir, and acyclovir physically
mixed with MSNs, displayed a sharp melting point at ca. 250 °C
in the DSC curve, which signified the crystalline state of acyclovir
(Figure 6B). Following
drug loading to form ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3, the melting point
peak disappeared, indicating the transition of acyclovir to the amorphous
state and the successful incorporation of the drug within the mesopores.
Moreover, XPS revealed that ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 had a sharp
nitrogen peak (Figure S7A), which signified
the presence of acyclovir while retaining the sulfonate group (Figure S7B). As a control, unfunctionalized MSNs
(1) were also successfully loaded with acyclovir (ACV-MSN)
with a final drug loading value of 30.0 w/w % (Figure S8).

Figure 6 (A) TGA graph showing the weight loss of ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 and MSN-phenyl-SO3 with increasing temperature
(°C). The difference in weight loss represents the amount of
loaded acyclovir. Weight loss (%) of samples was measured starting
from 150 °C to exclude the weight loss due to the evaporation
of water (range studied: 150–900 °C). (B) DSC curves of
ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3, free ACV, unfunctionalized MSNs (1), and a physical mixture of ACV and unfunctionalized MSNs.
The presence or lack of a peak at the melting point of acyclovir (ca.
250 °C) indicates whether the drug is in the crystalline or amorphous
state.

Drug Release and Antiviral
Assay of ACV-MSN-Phenyl-SO3
A drug release experiment
was conducted to determine the
rate and extent of acyclovir release from the ACV-MSN and ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 (Figure 7A).
This was done to help interpret the antiviral activity of the loaded
particles in subsequent plaque reduction assays. In the case of ACV-MSN,
the release profile reached a plateau within 10 min, showing the release
of ca. 79% of total acyclovir. With no physical barrier to impede
drug release, the burst release behavior of acyclovir from ACV-MSN
was expected. Meanwhile, the release of acyclovir from ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 was more gradual, reaching a plateau at ca. 30 min, and the
extent of acyclovir release was less, with ca. 70 w/w % release after
24 h (Figure S9). This may be due to the
effect of the surface functional groups, which may narrow the pore
opening, reducing the rate of drug release, and interact with the
drug, preventing complete drug release. Incomplete drug release from
MSNs has been reported in the literature,33−35 and future
studies should aim to ensure that release of acyclovir from ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 is more prolonged and complete. Sealing the pores with materials
such as polymers or functionalizing inner porous surfaces with small
hydrophobic molecules may be useful ways of controlling drug release.

Figure 7 (A) Drug
release experiment was conducted for ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 and ACV-MSN in a phosphate buffer solution with a pH of 7.4.
Drug release % was determined by the absorbance intensity at a λmax value of 253 nm measured by UV–visible spectrophotometry.
The values are the mean ± SD of two independent experiments.
(B) Results of a plaque reduction assay whereby the cells were treated
with ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 following the entry of HSV-1 to
Vero cells. Viral inhibition (%) was determined by the percent reduction
of plaque numbers compared to the untreated control. The values are
the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with duplicate
wells per treatment.

The potential multifunctional antiviral effects of the ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 system were investigated by treating Vero cells with the
nanoparticles at two different stages of the viral infectious life
cycle—preinfection and postinfection. To evaluate the efficacy
of ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 postviral entry, cells were initially
infected with HSV-1, and extracellular virions were removed by washing
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to ensure that any observed antiviral
effect is primarily due to the activity of acyclovir rather than the
GAG mimetics. ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 at nanoparticle concentrations
of 52 and 104 μg/mL was then incubated with cells for 1 h. Figure 7B illustrates that
ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 and free acyclovir at their highest
tested concentrations completely inhibited infection when the cells
were treated postviral entry. Moreover, MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) without loaded acyclovir (MSN-phenyl-SO3, DF
6.9 w/w %) at a particle concentration of 208 μg/mL exerted
a relatively weak antiviral effect against HSV-1. Therefore, the results
indicate that the observed antiviral effect is primarily due to the
action of acyclovir and not due to the effect of the GAG mimetic.

On the basis of the drug release study, ca. 65% of acyclovir is
released from ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 at pH 7.4, following a
1 h incubation period (Figure 7A). Therefore, ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 at concentrations
of 52 and 104 μg/mL with 34 w/w % drug loading would release
ca. 12 and 23 μg/mL acyclovir, respectively, during the postinfection
plaque reduction assay discussed above. To determine if the acyclovir
released from ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 retains its antiviral
potency, comparison was made with free acyclovir at concentrations
of ca. 21 and 42 μg/mL. ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 gave an
antiviral effect similar to that of a higher equivalent concentration
of free acyclovir (Figure 7B), which indicates that the processes used to prepare ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 do not diminish the antiviral potency of acyclovir. Moreover,
the antiviral activity of acyclovir loaded into ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 appears to be greater than that of free acyclovir, possibly
because of the improved delivery of acyclovir to infected cells via
cellular uptake of nanoparticles as described by Cavalli et al.27

The effect of the attached GAG mimetic
of ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 was evaluated to confirm the retention
of its antiviral activity,
which would endow the antiviral system with dual functionality. Following
the incubation of HSV-1 with ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3, including
ACV-MSN and free acyclovir as controls, the mixture was inoculated
to cells for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS to minimize
the exposure of the cells to acyclovir during the subsequent incubation
period, thus ensuring that the observed antiviral effect is primarily
due to the GAG mimetic rather than acyclovir. Although the cells were
initially exposed to acyclovir for 1 h, this was before virus infection,
which means that sufficient amounts of viral thymidine kinase are
unlikely to be present, leading to low concentrations of activated
acyclovir. This concept is supported by the lack of antiviral effect
of free acyclovir (Figure 8) at concentrations that gave close to 100% antiviral activity
in the postinfection assay (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the ACV-MSN would release ca. 200
μg/mL acyclovir based on the results of the drug release assay
(Figure 7A), and it
too exhibited no antiviral activity (Figure 8). Importantly, ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 inhibited the viral infection of cells, which is consistent with
the inhibition of viral entry. It is postulated that the attached
GAG mimetic of ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 bound the majority of
virions during the initial incubation period to make the virus ineffective.
When inoculated to Vero cells, the virions bound to ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 would be unable to enter and infect cells, leading to minimal
plaque growth. Both ACV-MSN and free acyclovir are unable to bind
to virions, and hence following inoculation to Vero cells, the unbound
HSV-1 is free to interact with cell receptors and infect cells. A
similar result was observed in a study by Nazemi et al., where the
outer surface of polymersomes was attached with sialic acid to inhibit
viral entry of influenza virus and loaded with zanamivir to prevent
the release of newly formed viruses from the host cell.36 Park et al. combined a cationic peptide that
is able to inhibit the viral entry of HSV-1 with acyclovir to also
target two mechanisms.37 Such approaches
may improve the antiviral effect, and further studies are warranted.
Similarly, our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the successful
preparation of drug-loaded GAG mimetic-functionalized nanoparticles
which are able to target two viral infection pathways. Apart from
small differences in viral entry glycoproteins, HSV-1 and HSV-2 are
closely related.38 Therefore, ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 would likely produce a similar result when tested against
HSV-2.

Figure 8 Results of a plaque reduction assay whereby the cells were treated
with nanoparticles (ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 and ACV-MSN) and
acyclovir previral entry of HSV-1. Viral inhibition (%) was determined
by the percent reduction of plaque numbers compared to the untreated
control. The values are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments
with duplicate wells per treatment.

Conclusions
This study revealed the important SARs
of GAG-mimetic functional
groups attached to MSNs in terms of anti-HSV activity. The sulfonate
group (3 and 5) was identified as a prerequisite
in relation to antiviral activity, with the benzene group (3) enhancing the antiviral response in comparison to an alkyl group
(5). MSNs with a benzene surface but lacking the sulfonate
group (7) displayed a relatively weak antiviral activity,
which highlights the importance of the sulfonate group. This study
also demonstrated, for the first time, the inhibition of two different
stages of the HSV life cycle by drug-loaded MSNs functionalized with
GAG mimetics: inhibition of viral entry and inhibition of viral DNA
replication. This proof-of-concept investigation will aid the development
of more sophisticated drug delivery systems that are able to incorporate
properties such as mucopenetration and/or sustained drug release.
A greater antiviral effect of acyclovir was observed when loaded into
ACV-MSN-SO3 compared with free acyclovir; hence, the possibility
of intracellular acyclovir release should be investigated in future
studies.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Hydrogen
peroxide 30 w/w % was
obtained from Chem-Supply. Ethanol, methanol, and toluene were purchased
from Merck. Dry toluene was prepared by storing toluene over 3 Å
molecular sieves overnight. TEOS, CTAB, Pluronic F127, trimethoxyphenylsilane,
3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, and 1,3-propane sultone were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. CSPTMS in dichloromethane (50 w/w %) was obtained
from Acros Organics. (N,N-Dimethyl-3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane
was obtained from Gelest. PBS tablets purchased from AMRESCO were
dissolved in water to obtain PBS pH 7.4 containing 137 mM sodium chloride,
2.7 mM potassium chloride, and 10 mM phosphate buffer. Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was obtained from Invitrogen and was
supplemented with penicillin, l-glutamine, and either 2 or
10 v/v % fetal calf serum (FCS). The HSV-1 used was the HSV-1 H129-GFP
strain described in McGovern et al.39 HSV-2
was a clinical isolate. Acyclovir was purchased from TCI. Unless stated
otherwise, the experiments were conducted at room temperature (ca.
23° C). The water used in this study was type II pure water according
to ASTM specification D1193-06.

Synthesis of MSNs (1)
CTAB (1.0 g) and
Pluronic F127 (4.0 g) were stirred in ethanol and NH4OH
(2.8% NH3 w/w) (2:5 v/v, 298 mL total) for 1 h to allow
complete dissolution. Then, 3.6 g of TEOS was added to the solution,
and the reaction mixture was stirred for 60 s and kept under quiescent
conditions for 24 h. The particles (1) were collected
by centrifugation at a 28 174 relative centrifugal force (rcf)
for 15 min and washed twice with type II pure water and finally with
ethanol. The particles (1) were dried in an oven overnight
at 60 °C.

Synthesis of MSN-Phenyl-SO3 (3)
MSNs (1) were functionalized with
sodium benzene sulfonate
to form MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) using a method
based on our previously published procedure.17 Briefly, the sulfonyl chloride intermediate (2) was
formed by stirring MSNs (1) in dry toluene (ca. 1:100
w/v ratio) and CSPTMS under reflux for 18–20 h under an atmosphere
of nitrogen gas. Compound 2 was collected by centrifugation
at an 18 031 rcf for 10 min and washed sequentially with toluene,
ethanol, and acetone. To form sodium benzene sulfonate-functionalized
MSNs (3), the sulfonyl chloride intermediate (2) was hydrolyzed by stirring in type II pure water for 24 h, and
then the particles were stirred in an aqueous solution of NaCl 10
w/v % for 2 h twice. Excess NaCl was removed by washing the particles
in type II pure water twice. The compound was dried in an oven overnight
at 60 °C. To synthesize batches of 3 with a lower
density of benzene sulfonate groups, the DF of 2 was
decreased by adding a smaller volume of CSPTMS in the functionalization
reaction, which following hydrolysis produced 3 with
a lower functionalization density. CSPTMS at volumes of 100, 150,
and 250 μL was added to ca. 450, 270, and 270 mg of silica suspended
in toluene, respectively, to form three batches of compound 2, which were then hydrolyzed to afford compound 3 with three different DFs.

Synthesis of MSN-Propyl-Thiol (4) and MSN-Propyl-SO3 (5)
To form
the thiol intermediate,
3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane was added dropwise to a suspension
of MSNs (1) in methanol at 60 °C and stirred overnight.
The particles were collected by centrifugation at a 32 055
rcf for 15 min and washed twice with type II pure water. The thiol-functionalized
MSNs (MSN-propyl-thiol) (4) were dried in an oven overnight
at 60 °C.

To form propyl sulfonate-functionalized MSNs
(MSN-propyl-SO3) (5), MSN-propyl-thiol (4) was oxidized by stirring in aqueous H2O2 30 w/w % for 24 h. The particles were collected by centrifugation
at an 18 031 rcf for 15 min and washed twice with type II pure
water. The particles were stirred in an aqueous solution of NaCl 10
w/v % for 2 h twice. Excess NaCl was removed by washing the particles
in type II pure water twice. The compound was dried in an oven overnight
at 60 °C.

Synthesis of MSN-Zw-SO3 (6)
The protocol to synthesize 3-(dimethyl(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)-ammonio)propane-1-sulfonate
was adapted from Estephan et al.40 1,3-Propane
sultone (1.6 mL) was added to a stirred solution of N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (4 mL)
in 20 mL of acetone. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h under
an atmosphere of nitrogen gas. The white precipitate was collected
by centrifugation (18 031 rcf, 5 min) and washed twice with
acetone. The compound was dried overnight in vacuo.

To functionalize
zwitterionic silane onto the surface of silica nanoparticles (MSN-Zw-SO3) (6), a protocol adapted from Estephan et al.
was used.40 MSNs (1) (140
mg) were dispersed in 30 mL of type II pure water, and an aqueous
solution of 3-(dimethyl(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)-ammonio)propane-1-sulfonate
(0.5 mL, ca. 160 mg/mL in type II pure water) was added. The mixture
was stirred at 80 °C for 24 h. The particles were collected by
centrifugation (32 055 rcf, 15 min) and washed twice with type
II pure water. The particles were then stirred in aqueous NaCl solution
(10 w/v %) twice for 2 h. The compound (6) was finally
washed with type II pure water and dried overnight at 60 °C.

Synthesis of MSN-Phenyl (7)
Trimethoxyphenylsilane
(1.2 mL) was added to a stirred suspension of MSNs (1) (170 mg) in 30 mL of dry toluene. The reaction proceeded under
reflux for 20 h under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas. The particles
were collected by centrifugation at an 18 031 rcf for 15 min
and washed sequentially with toluene, ethanol, and acetone. The compound
(MSN-phenyl) (7) was dried in an oven overnight at 60
°C.

Preparation of Acyclovir-Loaded MSNs
MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) or unfunctionalized MSNs (1) (20 mg) were dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol using a bath sonicator
for 10 min and then added to an aqueous solution of acyclovir (50
mg of acyclovir in 6 mL of type I pure water) and stirred at 200 rpm
for 48 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo using a rotary evaporator,
and the dried powder was washed six times with 10 mL of type II pure
water to remove excess acyclovir adsorbed on the surface of drug-loaded
nanoparticles. The compounds (ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 and ACV-MSN)
were dried in an oven overnight at 60 °C.

Characterization
The hydrodynamic diameter, PDI, and
zeta potential of the nanoparticle suspensions in type II pure water
were measured using a Malvern Nano ZS Zetasizer. The size and morphology
of the nanoparticles were determined based on TEM images using a JEOL
1010 instrument operated at 100 kV. The TEM samples were prepared
on 200-mesh copper-coated grids.

A Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 2
STAR system was used to obtain TGA data on the nanoparticles which
were weighed into aluminum oxide crucibles. The weight loss of samples
was recorded as the temperature was increased from 50–900 °C
at a heating rate of 5 °C/min.

XPS was conducted using
a Kratos Axis ULTRA X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer. 13C SSNMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker
AVANCE III spectrometer operated at 300 MHz.

Drug Release
The
release of acyclovir from acyclovir-loaded
MSN-phenyl-SO3 was investigated using a pH 7.4 phosphate
buffer. ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 or ACV-MSN was added to 50 mL
of pH 7.4 buffer and stirred at 100 rpm at 37 °C under sink conditions.
Samples (1.5 mL) were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals (0,
10, 20, 30 min, 1, and 2 h) and immediately replaced with an equal
volume of fresh buffer solution to maintain a constant volume. The
withdrawn samples were centrifuged (12 000 rcf, 4 min), and
the concentration of acyclovir was determined using UV–visible
spectrophotometry at a λmax value of 253 nm by reference
to a calibration curve (R2 values >
0.99).

SAR Studies
Vero cells were grown overnight in 24-well
plates at a seeding density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well.
Nanoparticles suspended in PBS (250 μL) were mixed with HSV-1
(ca. 49 plaque-forming units—pfu) or HSV-2 (ca. 38 pfu) diluted
with DMEM 2% FCS (50 μL) and incubated for 1 h. The suspension
was inoculated to Vero cells, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to enable
virus binding/entry, and the suspension was then aspirated and overlayed
with 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in DMEM 2% FCS at 1 mL/well. After incubating the plates for 3 days, the cells were fixed with
formaldehyde in PBS (0.4 w/v %) and stained with toluidine blue in
water (0.1 w/v %), and the plaques were counted under a microscope.
In our previous study,17 MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) was determined to have only minor effect
on the viability of Vero cells following 48 h of incubation at concentrations
up to 1000 μg/mL. Therefore, cytotoxicity was not studied in
this project because, in the SAR studies, relatively low concentrations
of nanoparticles were used with relatively short exposure times.

Acyclovir Study
Preinfection—Vero cells were
grown overnight in 24-well plates at a seeding density of 1.2 ×
105 cells/well. ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 (833 μg/mL),
ACV-MSN (833 μg/mL), and free acyclovir (42 μg/mL) suspended
in PBS were mixed with HSV-1 (ca. 35 pfu) diluted with DMEM 2% FCS
and incubated for 1 h. At the tested concentration, ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 would have released ca. 185 μg/mL and ACV-MSN released
ca. 200 μg/mL of acyclovir after 1 h based on the drug release
experiment. The suspension was inoculated to Vero cells for 1 h at
37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS to exclude the effects
of acyclovir released into the extracellular environment. The suspension
was then aspirated and overlayed with 0.6% CMC in DMEM 2% FCS at 1
mL/well. After incubating the plates for 3 days, the cells were fixed,
stained, and counted as described above.

Postinfection—To
investigate the effect of the loaded acyclovir of ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3, Vero cells (1.2 × 105 cells/well) grown
in 24-well plates were infected with HSV-1 (ca. 71 pfu/well), for
2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The extracellular viruses
were removed by washing the wells with PBS twice. The cells were then
inoculated with ACV-MSN-phenyl-SO3 (52 and 104 μg/mL
nanoparticle equivalent to approximately 12 and 23 μg/mL acyclovir,
respectively, following 1 h of incubation), acyclovir (21 and 42 μg/mL),
or MSN-phenyl-SO3 (3) with a DF of 6 w/w %
(208 μg/mL) dispersed/dissolved in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. The suspension was aspirated and overlayed
with 0.6% CMC in DMEM 2% FCS at 1 mL/well. After incubating the plates
for 3 days, the cells were fixed, stained, and counted as described
above.
