Peptides
that recognize artificial materials including synthetic
polymers and small molecules are drawing attention in the fields of
biotechnology and chemical biology. In particular, reversible peptide
aptamers that associate with the target molecules only under specific
conditions are interesting. In this work, peptide aptamers that recognize
a phenolphthalein derivative (PhP: a pH-sensitive organic dye) immobilized
on a solid surface in a pH-dependent manner were selected using an
in vitro display method (cDNA display). Considering the hydrophobic
and aromatic nature of PhP, we prepared a biased DNA library (3A library)
that encodes more aromatic amino acids than the standard random codon
and performed seven rounds of selection from >1010 peptide
species. The selected peptides including LVFLIWWM (LV59) associated
with PhP-modified solid support (sepharose resin and magnetic beads)
in neutral buffer but readily dissociated under basic conditions where
PhP undergoes large structural change from lactone to quinoid, which
is accompanied by increase of hydrophilicity and anionic charge. Control
experiments suggested that LV59 recognized both phenol and lactone
moieties, and the association under neutral pH is mainly driven by
π-stacking and hydrophobic interaction between the peptide and
PhP. Notably, however, total hydrophobicity and number of aromatic
rings did not completely explain the affinity, and sequence specificity
was observed to some extent. After further optimization, this interaction
pair would be practically useful for protein purification.

==== Body
Introduction
Polypeptides play fundamental
roles in molecular recognition in
biology: they recognize not only other proteins but also small molecules
including lipids,1 saccharides,2 nucleic acids,3,4 and others5,6 with high specificity. To optimize or create such peptides, directed
evolution technologies have been established that can generate and
evaluate large numbers of peptides in vitro, such as phage display,7 ribosome display,8 and mRNA display.9,10 So far, many peptides that bind
to non-natural substances such as synthetic polymers, organic dyes,
and explosives have been successfully identified.11 Pioneering works in this field include peptides that bind
to semiconductor surfaces12 and carbon
nanotubes13 selected by phage display.
Furthermore, stimuli-responsive peptides, which recognize target substances
only under certain conditions, are lately gaining attention in terms of molecular recognition and
practical applications. For example, Serizawa and others performed
phage display screening to find peptides that preferentially (2–5
fold) bind to cis (i.e., UV-irradiated) forms of azobenzene on polymer–film
surfaces.14,15 Ito and others also selected a photo-responsive
peptide aptamer that incorporated an azobenzene moiety using ribosome
display.16

In addition to the display
techniques above, cDNA display17−23 is another promising technology to identify peptide aptamers from
a large library. In cDNA display, a special DNA linker (Figure S1) featuring puromycin (an antibiotic
that is incorporated at the C-terminal of a nascent peptide in ribosomes)18 is ligated to an mRNA library, yielding mRNA–linker
complex. In vitro translation and mRNA–protein linkage is then
performed, and the mRNA moiety is reverse-transcribed to yield cDNA–protein
conjugates for use in selection processes (Figure S2, summarized scheme is also shown in Figure 3c). Compared with other techniques, cDNA
display has advantages in terms of library size (1012–13) and stability under harsh conditions such as organic solvents,
strong acid/base, and heat. We and others have used cDNA display to
identify peptides that associate with proteins,18,19 nucleic acids,20 solid phases,21 and lipid membranes.22 However, though a paper was published on a binder for a small biomolecule
(ATP),23 there is no report on peptide
aptamers for artificial small molecules with this technique. Further,
none of the targets or selected peptides so far underwent stimuli-responsive
structural change.

Here, we designed and performed the first
cDNA display-based selection
of peptide aptamers that recognize the titration status of a small
molecule, at least in part. We focused on pH indicators as ligands
because some of these dyes show drastic, quick, and reversible structural
change in response to pH (Figure 1).24 We also envisioned
that such pH-dependent binding systems would be applicable for protein
purification or smart materials if specific and high-affinity peptides
were selected. In particular, we prepared a cDNA display library consisting
of eight amino acids and performed selection against a phenolphthalein
derivative (PhP, Figure 2a) immobilized on a solid phase (sepharose resin/magnetic beads).
We then analyzed the selected sequences and found LVFLIWWM (LV59),
which associated with PhP under neutral conditions and rapidly dissociated
under basic conditions. Evaluation of analogous peptides and control
target beads was also performed to elucidate the binding mechanism.

Figure 1 Schematic
representation of the purpose of this work. We aimed
to screen peptides that associate with a phenolphthalein derivative
(PhP) at pH 7 (i.e., closed lactone form) and dissociate from the
molecule at pH 12 (i.e., open quinoid form).

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of
the Target Compound
As mentioned
above, we chose pH-dependent structural change of a dye as the target
of in vitro selection. Compared with light irradiation,14−16 pH change is more easily and reproducibly performed, and in most
cases, titration status can be checked with the naked eye. In contrast,
it is often difficult to completely shift the whole population of
azobenzene molecules to one isomer because of the thermal reverse
process.25 Moreover, immobilized azobenzene
molecules seem to yield more mixed cis/trans isomers at the photostationary
state.25 Although a few DNA aptamers that
show pH-dependent binding to the targets have been developed recently,26,27 there is no report of the selection of pH-dependent peptide aptamers.

Phenolphthalein is one of the most widely used pH indicators, which
changes its color from colorless (pH ≤ 9) to red (pH ≥
9).24 This is due to the structural change
from a closed lactone form to an open quinoid form upon deprotonation
(Figure 2b).28 First, we synthesized amino-modified phenolphthalein
and coupled that to a short poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linker (Scheme S1). The compound, which we named PhP,
was immobilized to the sepharose resin having the carboxy group and
showed distinct color change in response to pH (Figure 2c). PhP-immobilized magnetic beads were also
prepared accordingly. Interestingly, apparent pKa of immobilized PhP was about 11, which was shifted to more
basic than that in solution (pKa = 9.6, Figure S3). Although the exact mechanism is not
known, similar shift had been suggested in a previous paper.29 As negative control, resin/beads were also prepared
using ethanolamine or phenol (Scheme S2) as the immobilized molecule.

Library Design and cDNA
Display Formation
We then designed
a new peptide library of eight residues using a biased mixed codon
(3A library, library diversity = 3 × 1010, Figure S4). This library should present more
aromatic amino acids (>2 fold) than a standard NNN random codon
(Figure 3a), and we considered it desirable because PhP is a
hydrophobic
compound with three aromatic rings under neutral conditions. The random
moiety was inserted at the N-terminal of a scaffold protein (BDA:
B domain of protein A)30 to avoid potential
steric interference of the cDNA moiety, and other DNA sequences for
preparing cDNA display such as the T7 promoter and linker hybridization
region (LHR) were attached to make the full construct (Figures 3b and S4). The efficiency of cDNA display formation (i.e., the ratio
of a successfully purified display molecule to input mRNA–linker)
of the construct was estimated to be about 2% (Figure S5).

selection cycle. (d) Progress of selection monitored by qPCR. (e)

was confirmed, with almost no binding to the control beads.

In Vitro Selection
Next, we performed an in vitro selection
consisting of seven rounds, starting from 120 pmol of mRNA–linker
(Figure 3c). Considering
the formation efficiency, the number of obtained cDNA display molecules
should be 1.5 × 1011. This would cover most of the
sequence space of the 8-mer peptide library. In the first and second
rounds, PhP-immobilized sepharose resin was used as the binding target,
and elution with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 80 mM NaOH aq
was performed, respectively (Figures S6 and S7). Notably, cDNA display is tolerant to such strong alkaline solution,
unlike mRNA display and ribosome display. In this sense, this selection
takes an advantage of the stability of cDNA display. From the third
to sixth rounds, selections using PhP-immobilized magnetic beads and
aq NaOH were performed. Binding, washing, and eluting conditions were
gradually changed during the process (see the Supporting Information for details). For each round, control
selection with negative (i.e., PhP-non-immobilized) beads was also
performed using the same display libraries. cDNA in the eluents were
then quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Figure 3d) to monitor enrichment
and selectivity. After the sixth round, peptides having affinity to
PhP (but not to the beads themselves) seemed to be sufficiently concentrated
from the initial library. We then performed the final round with proteinase
K elution, which hydrolyzes peptides before the elution with NaOH
aq, to remove molecules that associated with PhP at their cDNA part
(Figure 3e). With this
elution, almost no DNA was recovered from the control beads, which
suggested that collected DNA from the PhP beads should encode peptides
that had affinity to PhP. Notably, recovery efficiency of the seventh
round was much reduced from the previous round, probably because of
the overnight incubation at 37 °C in the presence of proteinase
K at the elution step (for detailed protocols, see the Supporting Information), which might decompose
some DNA or promote physical adsorption of the cDNA display molecule
to the plastic tubes.

Identification of LV59
The final
selected DNA sample
was then analyzed by deep sequencing. There remained >103 peptides, suggesting relatively low selection pressure, so we cloned
several top sequences and prepared cDNA display. Their pH-dependent
interaction with PhP-bound beads was evaluated using SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figures 4a,b and S8). As an index
of peptide affinity, recovery efficiency (i.e., ratio of NaOH-eluted
peptide to the input) was calculated (Table 1). A few peptides, including LVFLIWWM (LV59),
bound to PhP at pH 7 and dissociated under alkaline conditions as
we expected, and it did not bind to the control beads (Table 1, Figure 4b). LV59 consists of hydrophobic amino acids
only and have three aromatic residues. Currently, we do not know why
the most abundant sequences (RYIRYYCP and VRRWWYPC) did not show detectable
association to PhP beads, but one possibility is disulfide bond formation
at a Cys residue with other peptides in the selection process. Notably,
although
the other peptides that showed affinity to PhP consisted of hydrophobic
amino acids only (and some had more aromatic residues), LV59 showed
highest recovery efficiency. This result indicated that total hydrophobicity
of the peptide is an important but not the sole parameter for the
interaction with PhP. Enrichment of aromatic residues except phenylalanine
during the selection process was also seen at the library level (Figure S9). We believe these data supported our
design and usage of 3A library for the selection.

of the experiment. Mixture of cDNA display (blue circle) and cDNA–linker
complex (orange square) of LV59-BDA was reacted with PhP-immobilized

by NaOH elution. IP: input, FT: flow through, EL: eluent. (b) SDS-PAGE
analysis of fractions. Association of cDNA display to PhP(+) beads
was supported by the decrease of the band of FT, and its NaOH-dependent
recovery was confirmed from the band at EL. (c) Elution of cDNA display
under different pH levels. Except for the second lane from the left,
PhP beads were used. Samples were fluorescently detected using the
fluorescein attached to the linker (see Figure S1).

b Recovery efficiency
was evaluated
from the intensity of the eluted cDNA display band of SDS-PAGE. N.D.
indicates that recovery was not detected at all.

c For these two peptides, recovery
efficiency was evaluated at the peptide–linker forms.

Importantly, elution of LV59 was
observed from pH 11 and gradually
increased up to pH 12.5 (Figure 4c), which matched the color change of the immobilized
PhP (Figure 2c). We
also fused LV59 to another protein, PDO (POU-specific DNA binding
domain of Oct-1)31 and performed the same
experiment (Figure S10). This confirmed
that LV59 could reversibly associate to PhP regardless of the conjugated
protein.

Analysis of LV59 Derivatives
We also prepared a peptide–linker
complex of LV59-BDA by hydrolysis of mRNA during the formation of
cDNA display (Figures 5a and S2) and used it for association/dissociation
experiments. The obtained results not only proved that the molecule
was bound to PhP in the absence of the cDNA (or mRNA) moiety but also
indicated that recovery efficiency (i.e., ratio of eluted peptide
to the input) was higher when these moieties were removed (compare Figures 5b and 4b). Apparent increased affinity is reasonable considering
the bulky size and highly negative charge of the nucleic acid moieties,
as demonstrated in our previous paper.32 Taken together, the results indicated that the LV59 peptide (and
not its nucleic acid) had some affinity to the closed lactone form
of PhP but not to the open quinoid form. Importantly, both PhP beads
and the eluted peptide could be used for the capture/release experiment
again (Figure S11), which eliminated the
possibility of decomposition- or irreversible denaturation-induced
elution of the peptide during NaOH treatment.

(a) Peptide–linker conjugates (green triangle) were prepared
by RNase treatment of mRNA display (see Figure S2), which were mostly composed of peptides. They were used

eluent. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and fluorescently detected
using the fluorescein attached to the linker.

Next, to investigate the interaction of LV59 and PhP in more
detail,
peptide–linker complexes of several derivatives were synthesized
and tested. Because LV59 contained three aromatic residues, we first
replaced them for alanine (LV59A). This peptide did not show any detectable
affinity (Figure 5c),
clearly demonstrating the pivotal roles of π-stacking (and hydrophobic
interaction) between these aromatic amino acids and phenolphthalein.
The result also supported our working hypothesis in terms of the library
design (vide supra). We also examined the effect of salt for this
interaction, and a high concentration of salts gave a positive effect
for the association (Figure S12), which
further supported nonelectrostatic, hydrophobicity-driven interaction.
Hence, the association mechanism of LV59 to PhP could be explained
mainly by π-stacking of tryptophans and phenylalanine and in
part by van der Waals interaction of all amino acids. In general,
such interactions are not very specific and many (if not all) peptides
consisting of hydrophobic and aromatic residues should have some affinity
to PhP. This may explain why there were many sequences left after
7 rounds of selection and that even top sequences had relatively small
read numbers (Table 1).

However, when another derivative, LV59R, which had an inverted
sequence of LV59, was tested, recovery efficiency was less than half
that of LV59 (Figure 5d), which indicated that the total hydrophobicity and the number
of tryptophans were important but not the only factors. In addition,
when LV59 was attached at the C-terminal of BDA, a remarkable decrease
of binding was observed, implying that the peptide–PhP interaction
is position-specific (Figure S13). As another
control, we made phenol-immobilized beads (Scheme S2) and examined if LV59 associated with the beads similarly.
As shown in Figure 5e, recovery efficiency was only 40% compared with PhP-beads, indicating
that these peptides do not associate well with simple (but also hydrophobic
and pH-sensitive) phenol or the PEG linker for immobilization, and
they recognize the lactone structure of phenolphthalein under neutral
pH to some extent. All these experiments have been performed several
times, and the results were reproducible (Table S1).

Conclusions
We designed and performed
the first in vitro peptide selection
against an immobilized pH-sensitive organic dye, PhP, using cDNA display
technology. The selected peptide, LV59, which did not have any pH-sensitive
side chains, associated with the dye-conjugated solid phase under
neutral pH but apparently showed no affinity to the same material
under basic conditions. After control experiments, it became clear
that the dissociation is related to the pH-dependent structural change
of PhP. Although the detailed binding mechanism is not clear, it is
likely that π-stacking of tryptophans of the peptide and the
three (protonated) aromatic rings of the dye play a pivotal role.
LV59, and all other peptides in the library, has a pH-sensitive free
amino group at the N-terminus, and we cannot eliminate the possibility
that this group partially contributes to the interaction with the
dye. Because only a small number of peptides showed detectable pH-dependent
affinity with PhP (Table 1), it is clear that the role of this group alone is small,
if any. However, the synergetic effect of this amino group and the
side chains of LV59 might be important for the interaction. Anyway,
upon alkalization of the solution, PhP is deprotonated with concomitant
color change, and the molecule becomes hydrophilic and anionic. This
drastic structural change inhibits the above interaction and elutes
the peptide from the beads. In contrast to previous studies using
photo-isomerization,14−16 the association/dissociation in this work also involves
(de)protonation of a molecule and change of zeta potential of the
solid phase. In this sense, there may be an argument that LV59 does
not recognize pure conformation of the PhP at the single molecule
level. However, considering a previous work,14,15 the target organic molecule was used in the film; so, a change of
macroscopic properties of the material could not be completely denied.
Taking the results of phenol-immobilized control beads, we believe
it is safe to say that our peptides recognize PhP that was immobilized
on the solid material only at its lactone form.

Of course, there
is more to study and optimize. For example, detailed
characterization of the binding mechanism and affinity is yet to be
performed. Also, a low recovery efficiency is a problem for practical
applications, even though more target proteins could be obtained by
repeated purification from the flow through (Figure S11). We believe further optimization of peptides is necessary,
and we are moving in this direction now with newly designed libraries
and selection protocols.

Methods
Preparation of the PhP-Immobilized
Solid Phase
5-(NH2-PEG2-amide)-phenolphthalein,
or PhP, was synthesized
from 4-nitrophthalic anhydride and phenol in five steps. Detailed
synthetic procedures and characterization of the compounds are described
in the Supporting Information. The obtained
compound was immobilized to the NHS-activated solid phase (resin or
beads), and the unreacted functional group on the solid phase was
passivated with ethanolamine. Control beads without PhP were also
prepared.

DNA Construction
The DNA library used for selection
was prepared by 2-step primer-extension PCR from the DNA coding BDA18 and the primers shown in Table S2. The product was purified by preparative PAGE and
amplified by PCR. The sequence of the final product was checked by
Sanger sequencing. For more details, please refer the Supporting Information. Insertion of LV59 and
other peptides at the N-terminus of BDA (or PDO) was also performed
in a similar way.

Preparation of cDNA Display
Conversion
of the DNA library
to cDNA display was performed according to the method described in
our previous paper,33 with slight modifications.
Briefly, DNA was transcribed to mRNA using T7 RiboMAX Large Scale
RNA Production System (Promega) and photo-ligated to the cnvK-rG linker, which had been prepared as described in the Supporting Information. The obtained mRNA–linker
complex was then in vitro translated with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate
system (Promega, 6 pmol of mRNA–linker was added in a 50 μL
reaction volume) at 30 °C for 20 min. After incubation in the
presence of high K+ and Mg2+ to promote mRNA
display formation, the mRNA display library was immobilized on streptavidin
(SA)-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 magnetic
beads, Invitrogen, 60 μL) at 25 °C for 30 min. The immobilized
library was then reverse-transcribed by the ReverTra Ace reverse transcriptase
(Toyobo, Japan, 200 U in a 50 μL reaction volume) at 42 °C
for 30 min. RNase T1 (250 U in 50 μL, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min 37
°C
to release the mRNA/cDNA–protein fusion molecules (i.e., cDNA
display) from the beads. The eluted crude cDNA display library was
purified by the His6 tag inserted at the C-terminus of
the protein, using His Mag Sepharose Ni beads (20 μL, GE Healthcare).
Detailed protocol is described in the Supporting Information.

Selection of Peptides against PhP
The purified cDNA
display library was first incubated with the control solid phase without
PhP to remove nonspecific binders. This preselection process was repeated
for several times if necessary. In general, the flow-through was then
incubated with the PhP-immobilized solid phase at 4 °C for 30
min, and the material was washed six times with selection buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Bound
cDNA display molecules were eluted twice with 80 mM NaOH aq at 25
°C for 15–30 min and the eluate was immediately neutralized
with 1 M Tris (pH 6.6). From the second round, the amount of cDNA
in each fraction was quantified by qPCR, and the results were normalized
to the total input. At the first round, elution was performed by 1%
SDS instead of NaOH aq, and at the seventh round, proteinase K was
also used for elution. From the third round, control selections were
also performed, where control resin or beads were used instead of
PhP-immobilized resin or beads to obtain information on selectivity.
After each round, PCR amplification of the eluate was performed and
the obtained DNA was used for the preparation of the cDNA display
library for the next round. Detailed protocol is described in the Supporting Information.

Formation of Peptide–Linker
Complexes
The mRNA–linker
complex (6 pmol) was converted to mRNA display as described above.
Immobilization of mRNA display molecules on Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin
C1 beads (60 μL) was performed at 25 °C for 30 min, and
then, RNase T1 (200 U) in selection buffer (40 μL) was added
to decompose the mRNA moiety. The obtained supernatant solution contained
the titled peptide–linker complex. Detailed protocol is described
in the Supporting Information.

Calculation
of Recovery Efficiency
cDNA display was
prepared as described above, but purification using Ni-beads was not
performed. Then, crude cDNA display (i.e., the input) was incubated
with PhP-immobilized Dynabeads MyOne Carboxylic Acid at 25 °C
for 30 min. The beads were washed with selection buffer and bound
cDNA display was eluted with 50 mM NaOH aq at 25 °C for 15 min.
The eluate was neutralized with Tris-HCl buffer (1 M, pH 6.6). Fractions
were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking–6% separating,
20 mA, 120 min) containing 8 M urea, after the RNase H treatment.
Band intensities were quantified using fluorescein, which was labeled
at the puromycin linker. Recovery efficiency was calculated as the
ratio of cDNA display in the eluate to that in the input. For peptide–linker
complex, essentially the same protocol was used. Detailed protocol
is described in the Supporting Information.
