In
this paper, magnetic mesoporous carbon composites were prepared
by calcination of the mixture of magnesium citrate and Fe3O4@SiO2 in an inert atmosphere. A high content
of Fe3O4@SiO2 and MgO was in situ
embedded in a carbon matrix. After removing the MgO template by diluted
acid, the resulting material (Fe3O4@SiO2@mC) was subjected to further H2O2 oxidation
treatment. The formed oxygen-containing functional groups on the products
provided plenty of active sites for the adsorption of analytes of
interest. The obtained composites (Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2) exhibited a mesoporous structure
with a high specific surface area of 731 m2 g–1. The adsorption capacities of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 for Cu(II) and Pb(II) were
calculated to be 86.5 and 156 mg g–1, respectively.
Under optimal conditions, the adsorption isotherm of Cu(II) and Pb(II)
onto Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 fitted the Langmuir model and the adsorption kinetic was
well-correlated with the pseudo-second-order model. Besides, Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 exhibited fast removal dynamics (within less than 1 min) for Cu(II)
and Pb(II), demonstrating great application potential in wastewater
treatment.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With
the rapid development of modern industry and agriculture,
environmental pollution, especially water pollution, has become one
of the most serious social problems presently. Great efforts have
been made on the treatment of polluted water, and a series of pretreatment
techniques, for example, chemical precipitation,1 liquid–liquid extraction,2 membrane filtration,3 ion exchange,4 and adsorption,5 have
been applied for heavy metal removal from wastewater. Among these
technologies, adsorption has been demonstrated with the merits of
high efficiency, low cost, and ease of operation. A variety of adsorbents
have been employed for metal ion removal, such as metal–organic
frameworks,6 nanocomposites,7 biomaterials,8 graphene
oxide,2 and mesoporous carbons.9

Mesoporous carbons are one kind of porous
carbons (PCs), featuring
good chemical inertness and electrical conductivity, high specific
surface area, and easily controlled pore structure.10−12 They are attractive
for industrial applications as adsorbents,9 as electrode materials,13 as catalyst
supports,14 as sensors,15 in drug delivery,16 in energy
conversion, and as storage materials.17 A template method is generally adopted for the fabrication of mesoporous
carbons, in which a template, such as zeolites and silica (hard template),
or block/graft copolymer (soft template), is added into carbon precursors
to produce mesopores in PCs. Generally, the hard template is dissolved
by corrosive acid/alkali to form a porous structure; the soft template
is removed by using a relatively high temperature. Comparatively,
some sacrificial soft templates exhibit higher cost than commonly
used hard templates. The templating process using mesoporous silica
to generate mesoporous carbon is quite tedious and extremely difficult
for manufacturing on a large scale.18 MgO
has been demonstrated as a good alternative template for mesoporous
carbon preparation.19 In comparison with
zeolite/silica-based template methods for mesoporous carbon preparation,
MgO can be easily dissolved by noncorrosive acids; the morphology
of the PCs is tunable by varying the MgO precursor and carbon precursor;
MgO can be recycled easily.20 Morishita
et al.19 prepared mesoporous carbons via
a MgO template method, and the surface area of the products without
any activation process reached 2000 m2 g–1. The sizes of the formed mesopores were very similar to those of
the MgO particles. As one of the MgO precursors, citrate salts with
bulky organic anions are rich in carbon, of low cost, easy to obtain,
and are good precursors for carbon materials. Zhuo et al.21 prepared mesoporous carbons via simple pyrolysis
of magnesium citrate, which acted as a MgO precursor and a carbon
precursor simultaneously. The one-step pyrolysis process without the
need for a metal catalyst is very convenient and economical for preparing
mesoporous carbons.

Great progress has been made in adsorption
of organic substances
by developing various mesoporous carbons,22 although mesoporous carbons for heavy metal adsorption are still
scarce so far, mainly because of the difficulty in the recovery process
and lack of functional groups.

The integration of magnetism
to PCs can resolve the difficulty
in recovery of PCs from aqueous solution with the aid of an external
magnet. The separation of magnetic PCs from aqueous solution by an
external magnetic field is easy to operate and fast, avoiding the
tedious operation of centrifugation and filtration. Magnetic carbon
nanoparticles (NPs) with a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area (918 m2 g–1) exhibited
higher adsorption capacities than activated carbon and carbon nanotubes
for metal ions.23 Cheng et al.24 prepared porous Fe3O4@C
nanocapsules, which exhibited a high removal efficiency (99.6%), large
adsorption capacity (79 mg g–1 for Pb), and rapid
removal dynamics (within 1 min) for heavy metal removal applications.
However, for magnetic carbon materials carbonized at a high temperature
(800–1000 °C), the oxygen-containing groups on their surface
would be greatly lost, leading to low adsorption capacities for metals
(e.g., 7.79 mg g–1 for Cu(II)).23 To resolve this problem, oxidation treatments have been
frequently used, and they contribute to the formation of numerous
−OH and −COOH groups on the surface of carbon materials.25 H2O2 is a kind of mild
oxidizing agent, which can generate −OH and −COOH groups
on the surface of carbon framework and maintain the original mesoporous
structure simultaneously. During the H2O2 oxidation
process, the groups of −CH2 and −CH on the
carbon skeleton are first oxidized to C–OH and then converted
to −C=O groups. It is attributed to the corrosion of
the carbon wall, increasing the size of mesopores and pore volume.26

On the basis of these facts, this paper
aimed to prepare magnetic
mesoporous carbons by using magnesium citrate as both carbon precursor
and magnesium precursor and Fe3O4@SiO2 as an iron precursor; to functionalize the obtained magnetic mesoporous
carbons via H2O2 oxidation process; and to adopt
them for metal ion removal from aqueous solution.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Apparatus and Chemicals
The determination
of target metals was performed with an IRIS Intrepid II XSP model
radial inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES)
instrument (Thermo, USA), and the corresponding operation conditions
are displayed in Table 1. A GL-12K model tubular quartz reactor (Kejing Materials Technology
Co. Ltd., Hefei, China) was used to synthesize the magnetic nanocomposites.
The pH measurement was conducted with a 320-S pH meter (Mettler Toledo,
China). Magnetic separation process was performed by using an Nd–Fe–B
magnet (15.0 × 6.0 × 1.6 cm).

Stock solutions of 1000 mg L–1 Cu(II)
and Pb(II)
were obtained by dissolving analytical reagents of Cu(Ac)2 and Pb(NO3)2 (Shanghai Reagent Factory, China)
in ultrapure water, respectively, and the working solutions with specific
concentrations were obtained by stepwise dilution of the corresponding
stock solution. FeCl3·6H2O, FeCl2·4H2O, HNO3, ammonia, NaOH, and ethanol
were of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemicals Co.,
Ltd (Shanghai, China). Magnesium citrate was purchased from Aladdin
Corporation (Shanghai, China). All solid reagents and solvents used
in the whole experiment were of analytical grade or better. Ultrapure
water (18.2 MΩ·cm) used throughout the experiments was
obtained from a Milli-Q water system (Molsheim, France).

2.2 Fabrication of Fe3O4@SiO2
The naked Fe3O4 NPs
and Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were synthesized
via a coprecipitation method27 and a sol–gel
method,28 respectively. The details are
provided in the Supporting Information.

2.3 Fabrication of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC
The fabrication of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC is referred from ref (16) with some modifications.
In a typical synthesis, magnesium citrate and Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs, with the weight ratio varying from 5/5
to 9.5/0.5, were ground together for 1 h in a mortar to get a homogeneous
mixture. For carbonization process, the obtained mixture was placed
in a tube furnace and calcined at 600 °C (at a heating rate of
5 K min–1) for 2 h in Ar. The obtained composites
were treated with 0.5 mol L–1 HNO3 to
remove the MgO template, and magnetic mesoporous carbons (Fe3O4@SiO2@mC) were obtained. For comparison,
mesoporous carbons were prepared using the same procedure by carbonizing
magnesium citrate without adding Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs.

2.4 Fabrication of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2
To introduce
enough hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups on the carbon matrix
without damaging the original mesoporous structure, the obtained Fe3O4@SiO2@mC was further treated by H2O2 oxidation according to ref (26) with some modifications.
Specifically, 0.15 g of the above-prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@mC (Fe3O4@SiO2/magnesium
citrate = 0.5/9.5) was treated with 8.0 mL of H2O2 (30 wt %) solution for 30 min under an ultrasonic bath at room temperature.
Finally, the resultant magnetic NPs were separated, washed, and subsequently
dried at 100 °C for 4 h. The obtained products were denoted as
Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2.

2.5 Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Thermo, USA) (4000–400 cm–1) in KBr pellets was used for the characterization
of the prepared materials. The crystalline structure was identified
using a Rigaku Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation,
Japan). SBET was measured by N2 adsorption at −196 °C with a micromeritics ASAP 2020
analyzer (USA), and all samples were outgassed at 120 °C for
12 h before measurements. SBET values
were calculated from the BET theory, whereas the total pore volume
was estimated from the amount adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99.
The images of the microstructure were taken by an X-650 scanning electron
microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope
(Tokyo, Japan). A PPMS-9 model vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM,
Quantum , USA) was employed for the characterization of the magnetic
properties.

2.6 Adsorption Studies
In the adsorption
experiments, 4 mL of sample solution containing Cu(II) and Pb(II)
adjusted to pH 6 was spiked with 4 mg of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2, followed by shaking
at room temperature for 5 min to reach equilibrium. Subsequently,
the mixed solutions were subjected to magnetic separation, and the
obtained aqueous solution was subjected to ICP–OES detection.
The adsorption capacity (qt, mg g–1) for Cu(II) and Pb(II) on Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 was calculated, and
the details are presented in the Supporting Information.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Fabrication
of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2
3.1.1 Calcination Temperature
The calcination
temperature was optimized according to carbonization yield and the
adsorption capacity of the obtained products for Cu(II) and Pb(II).
As the pyrolysis temperature of magnesium citrate is around 500 °C,20 the effect of calcination temperature on the
carbonization was investigated by calcining pure magnesium citrate
at 600, 700, and 800 °C under an Ar atmosphere. The carbonization
yield is calculated by dividing the product mass obtained after calcination
with the mass of pure magnesium citrate before calcination. It was
found that when we increased the carbonization temperature from 600
to 800 °C, the carbonization yield decreased from 43 to 36%.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed for Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and the mixture of Fe3O4@SiO2 and Mg citrate (0.5/9.5) in an inert atmosphere
to monitor pyrolysis process, and the result is shown in Figure S1. After calcination and removal of MgO
template by washing with diluted acid, the obtained products are denoted
as Mg–C-T, where T stands
for the carbonization temperature (600, 700, or 800 °C). It was
found that the adsorption capacities of 43.9, 25.9, and 24.3 mg g–1 were obtained for Cu(II) and 74.8, 61.5, and 60.9
mg g–1 were obtained for Pb(II) by Mg–C-600
°C, Mg–C-700 °C, and Mg–C-800 °C, respectively.
The decreasing sorption capacity of the products along with the increase
of the calcination temperature is probably due to the loss of oxygen-containing
groups under high temperature. On the other hand, it was found that
magnetism of the products was decreased with the increase of the calcination
temperature from 600 to 800 °C. Thus, a calcination temperature
of 600 °C was adopted for the synthesis of the composites.

3.1.2 Mass Ratio of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs/Magnesium Citrate
To evaluate the adsorption
capacity of magnetic composites, the mass ratio of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs to magnesium citrate in the precursor
was investigated in the range of 5/5–0.5/9.5. The sorption
capacity of Cu(II) and Pb(II) on the obtained magnetic composites
was evaluated. The results are shown in Figure 1. With the increase of magnesium citrate
mass in the precursor mixture, the sorption capacities for Cu(II)
and Pb(II) were gradually increased. When the ratio of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs to magnesium citrate was decreased
to 0.5/9.5, the adsorption capacity was close to that of pure mesoporous
carbon material. Thus, the mass ratio of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs to magnesium citrate as 0.5/9.5 was employed
for subsequent experiments.

Figure 1 Effect of mass ratio of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs/magnesium citrate on the adsorption capacity
of Cu(II) and Pb(II).

3.1.3 Pretreatment Time of H2O2 Oxidization
To improve the hydrophilicity and adsorption
capacity of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC, the mild
oxidizing agent H2O2 was adopted to introduce
more oxygen-containing groups to the carbon surface. It was found
that the specific surface area of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC seriously decreased (70 m2 g–1) after H2O2 (30 wt %) treatment at room temperature
after 12 h, mainly because of the cleavage of part C–C bonds
by H2O2 and the mesostructure collapses in Fe3O4@SiO2@mC.26,29 According to ref (26), H2O2 treatment was processed for 30 min for
the obtained Fe3O4@SiO2@mC in this
work. The specific surface area of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 (731 m2 g–1) was close to that of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC (781 m2 g–1); the porous structure
of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC remains almost unchanged
after H2O2 treatment. Relevant information is
included in section 3.2.3.

3.2 Characterization
3.2.1 Powder X-ray Diffraction Measurements and
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC is
shown in Figure 2a.
For the obtained magnetic PCs before acid washing, the characteristic
diffraction peaks of MgO (200 and 220) can be seen clearly.30 The intensities of diffraction peaks are very
strong and sharp, and they are in a highly crystalline state, indicating
that a large quantity of MgO NPs were in situ embedded in the carbon
matrix after high-temperature calcination. On the other hand, carbons
formed from magnesium citrate are amorphous (002) and difficult to
detect in the XRD pattern. Besides, the products obtained under 700
and 800 °C have been characterized by XRD, and it also showed
an amorphous state for these carbons. For Fe3O4@SiO2@mC obtained after 0.5 mol L–1 HNO3 washing, MgO diffraction peaks disappeared from the XRD spectrum,
indicating a complete dissolution of MgO particles. The XRD pattern
of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 is very similar to that of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC, indicating that the oxidation treatment does not change
the crystalline phase of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC. Besides, Fe3O4 (311) at a 2θ value
of 35 is observed for all three curves, which demonstrates that the
magnetic core of Fe3O4 is embedded in the obtained
PCs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to monitor
the elemental contents for the prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@mC before and after oxidation treatment, and the
result is shown in Table S1. It demonstrated
the existence of C, Fe, O, and Si.

separation under an external magnetic field.

3.2.2 FT-IR Measurements
The FT-IR spectra
of the prepared magnetic adsorbents (Fe3O4@SiO2, Fe3O4@SiO2@mC, and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2) are presented in Figure 2b. The FT-IR spectra of Fe3O4@SiO2 exhibit a wide and strong band at 1095 cm–1, which is assigned to O–Si–O stretching vibrations,
indicating that the naked Fe3O4 was coated by
Si. The FT-IR spectrum of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC shows a broad band at 3425 cm–1, attributed
to −OH stretching vibrations. The absorption bands appearing
at 1612 and 1384 cm–1 are ascribed to the asymmetric
vibrations and symmetric stretching vibrations of −COOH, respectively.
After H2O2 oxidation treatment, a new diffraction
peak appears at 1708 cm–1, which is ascribed to
the C=O vibrational stretching of −COOH, indicating
that more −COOH groups are generated in the carbon matrix.26

3.2.3 N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Isotherms
The specific surface area of the obtained magnetic
PCs was determined by the BET method. Table 2 shows the SBET values and the properties of pores of the magnetic nanocomposites.
For Fe3O4@SiO2@mC, a high BET surface
area of 781 m2 g–1 was obtained, with
a large pore volume of 0.47 cm3 g–1 and
an average pore width of 3.65 nm. After the oxidation treatment, no
obvious variation was observed for the surface area and pore structure
for Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2. Figure 2c
displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves
for Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2. It indicates
that the adopted H2O2 treatment did not damage
the structure of the obtained magnetic PCs.

Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2	731	245	486	0.42	3.56	
3.2.4 Magnetic Properties
The hysteresis
curves for the magnetic core and two magnetic composites were measured
by a VSM. The magnetic susceptibility of Fe3O4@SiO2 is 39 emu/g. As shown in Figure 2d, the magnetic susceptibility is 4.8 emu/g
for Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2, a little higher than that of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC (3.4 emu/g). It is possibly attributed to the
carbon loss during the oxidation process.26 Because of the superparamagnetic property, the suspension can be
easily separated via an external magnet. A clear solution was obtained
after separation by a magnet within 1 min, and the photographs of
an aqueous solution before and after separation are shown in the insets
of Figure 2d, with
Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 as the example.

3.2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
and Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the PCs obtained by the calcination of pure magnesium citrate are
presented in Figure 3a,b. The carbon films presented an irregular shape with rough wrinkles. Figure 3c,d presents the
SEM images of the obtained magnetic nanocomposites before and after
H2O2 oxidation treatment. It shows that NPs
are tightly coated on carbon films, and the morphology of magnetic
nanocomposites is similar to that before the oxidation treatment.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 (Figure 3e,f) also show that Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs are embedded in the carbon matrix.

and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 (d). TEM images of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC (e) and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 (f). The amplifications for a–d
images are 100, 500, 1000, and 500.

3.3 Effect of Sample pH
Solution pH would
determine the protonation degree of the active sites on the adsorbents
and affect the existing form of target ions. Thus, the pH effect on
the adsorption performance of the prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 for the removal of
Cu(II) and Pb(II) was investigated in the range of 2–8 at room
temperature. As shown in the results presented in Figure 4a, the removal efficiency of
Cu(II) and Pb(II) increases rapidly with the increase of pH from 2
to 6 and levels off with further increase of solution pH. A complete
removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) can be achieved in the pH range of 6–8
by using Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2. Considering that the pH range for domestic sewage
is 6–9, no pH adjustment is needed in the practical application
of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2.

Figure 4 Effect of pH on the removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) by Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 (a) and
Fe3O4@SiO2@mC (b). Adsorbent, 4 mg;
sample volume, 4 mL; and initial concentration of Cu(II) and Pb(II),
10.0 mg L–1.

For a comparison, the removal efficiency of Cu(II) and Pb(II)
obtained
by Fe3O4@SiO2@mC over pH 2–8
is also presented in Figure 4b. As can be seen, complete removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) is
obtained at a pH of approximately 7–8. This suggests that the
H2O2 oxidization process helps to broaden the
pH range for the application of magnetic PCs to some extent.

3.4 Adsorption Kinetics
The studies on
adsorption kinetics can not only estimate the adsorption rate but
also speculate the adsorption mechanism. The impact of reaction time
for the adsorption of Cu(II)/Pb(II) on Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 was investigated by spiking 50 mg
of adsorbents into 50 mL of sample solution containing Cu(II)/Pb(II)
(50.0 mg L–1). The results (Figure 5a,b) show that the adsorption equilibrium
could be achieved in less than 1 min, suggesting that Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 possess fast adsorption dynamics
for removing Cu(II) and Pb(II) from wastewater.

Cu(II) (a) and Pb(II) (b) vs contact time.
The pseudo-second-order sorption kinetic of Cu(II) (c) and Pb(II)
(d) onto Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2.

The adsorption kinetic processes
of Cu(II) and Pb(II) onto Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 were investigated
by using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models.
The details are provided in the Supporting Information. The experimental data were well-correlated with the pseudo-second-order
model, and the fitting curves are shown in Figure 5c,d along with the relevant kinetics parameters
listed in Table S2. It indicates that Cu(II)/Pb(II)
adsorption on Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 is rapid and controlled by chemical adsorption,31 which follows the second-order kinetic model.

3.5 Adsorption Capacity and Adsorption Isotherms
Adsorption
capacity is one of the important indexes for the evaluation
of the adsorbents, which depends on the specific surface area and
the density of active sites on the adsorbent. To estimate the adsorption
capacity, the sorption isotherm of Cu(II)/Pb(II) on the prepared adsorbents
is shown in Figure 6a,b. Remarkably, the adsorbed amount of Cu(II)/Pb(II) increases with
the increase of Cu(II)/Pb(II) initial concentration and then reaches
a plateau, which indicates the saturated adsorption of heavy metal
onto the adsorbents. The adsorption capacities of Cu(II) and Pb(II)
on the prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 were calculated to be 86.5 mg g–1 (1.36 mmol g–1) and 156 mg g–1 (0.75 mmol g–1), respectively. The difference
in adsorption capacity of Cu(II) and Pb(II) is possibly due to their
difference in ionic size. The ionic radii of Cu(II) and Pb(II) are
0.073 and 0.132 nm, respectively,32 and
Cu(II) with a smaller size would occupy the adsorption sites on a
certain adsorbent in larger mole quantities than Pb(II).

initial Cu(II) (a) and Pb (II) (b) concentration

and Pb (II) (d) on Fe3O4@SiO2@mC
and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2.

The adsorption capacity of Cu(II)
and Pb(II) on Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 is nearly twice
that obtained by Fe3O4@SiO2@mC, indicating
the improvement of adsorption capacity by H2O2 treatment. Moreover, a comparison of adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 with those of some other adsorption materials is shown in Table 3. The adsorption capacity
obtained by Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 for Cu(II) and Pb(II) is obviously higher than that
obtained by the reported carbon-based materials.2,23,24,33−38 Although the surface area of the prepared material is lower than
that of activated carbon, its adsorption capacity is significantly
higher than that of activated carbon. This indicates that the mesoporous
structure and oxygen-containing functional groups, rather than the
surface area, significantly contributed to the adsorption process.

isotherms of Cu(II)/Pb(II) adsorption onto Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 were analyzed using both monolayer
(Langmuir) and multilayer (Freundlich) adsorption models.31 The details are provided in the Supporting Information. The experimental data
fit better with Langmuir over Freundlich model (Figure 6c,d), and the results are presented in Table S3. The linear regression between Ce/qe and Ce is fitted with a high correlation coefficient
of 0.999, and the calculated maximum sorption capacities for Cu(II)
and Pb(II) (94.5 and 154 mg g–1) agree well with
the experimental values (86.5 and 156 mg g–1), demonstrating
that the sorption of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions on the as-prepared composites
fits the Langmuir model, and the adsorption on the surface of composites
is a monolayer adsorption.31

3.6 Selectivity
Selectivity is another
index to evaluate the properties of the as-prepared materials. Selective
adsorption of single elements or a class of similar elements is the
focus and hotspot in current research. Therefore, the effect of coexisting
ions (Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II)) on the adsorption
of Cu(II) and Pb(II) by Fe3O4@SiO2@mC and Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 was investigated, and the results are displayed in Figure S2. For Fe3O4@SiO2@mC, the removal efficiencies of Cu(II) and Pb(II) at pH 6
are about 60 and 90%, whereas for Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2, the removal efficiencies are
more than 90%. The removal efficiency of other ions is all below 30%.
After H2O2 treatment, the removal efficiency
for copper was improved by about 30%, probably because of the introduced
−OH and −COOH groups on the surface of PCs by H2O2. The results indicate that H2O2 oxidization greatly improves the selectivity of magnetic
PCs for Cu(II).

3.7 Regeneration and Reuse
Time
The regeneration
of adsorbents is the process of desorbing target ions from the adsorbents.
An ideal adsorbent should not only have excellent adsorption properties
but also can be regenerated easily. Thus, the regeneration of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 was further investigated. The experimental results showed that Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 could be regenerated easily by dispersing the recovered Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 in 0.5
mol L–1 HNO3 (4 mL) solution and sonicating
the mixture for 2 min. The recoveries for Cu(II) and Pb(II) obtained
by the reused Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 were above 95%. Moreover, the reusability experiment
revealed that the removal efficiency was still above 90% after five
adsorption–regeneration cycles (Figure S3), indicating a good application potential of Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 for removing
Cu(II) and Pb(II) from wastewater.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, magnetic PCs as highly efficient adsorbents were
prepared via simple one-step pyrolysis of magnesium citrate, which
acted as a MgO precursor and a carbon precursor simultaneously. The
obtained magnetic mesoporous carbon was further functionalized via
H2O2 oxidation process. The obtained Fe3O4@SiO2@mC-H2O2 exhibited a mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area
and presented fast adsorption dynamics (less than 1 min) and high
adsorption capacities of 86.5 and 156 mg g–1 for
Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively. It exhibited high removal efficiency,
good selectivity, reusability, and easy separation ability and has
a great application potential in industrial wastewater treatment.
