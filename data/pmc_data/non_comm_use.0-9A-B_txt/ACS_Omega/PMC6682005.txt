The
physical and chemical interactions
with vancomycin (VAN) were accessed between graphene oxide (GO) and
crumpled graphene oxide (CGO) to present the possible loading and
release mechanisms. The improved hydrophilicity and surface charge
were found on CGO through water contact angle and ζ-potential
measurements. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies
confirmed the attachment of VAN onto CGO or GO through π–π
stacking and hydrogen bonding. Both CGO–VAN and GO–VAN
drug complexes showed pH-controlled release property. The high VAN
loading and delayed release in CGO–VAN system were mainly due
to the crumpled morphology.

Introduction
Vancomycin was a branched tricyclic glycopeptide
antibiotic with
a molecular weight of 1450 Da and was frequently functioned as the
inhibitor of bacterial cell wall synthesis through hydrogen bonds
with peptidoglycan biopolymers.1,2 Specifically, vancomycin
was used to treat osteomyelitis,3 pneumonitis,4 sepsis,5 and other
bacterial infections, which were mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria.6 Because the large molecular size of vancomycin
led to low penetration into poorly vascularized sites and its high
concentration in blood increased the risk of nephrotoxicity,7,8 the high local concentration of vancomycin was advantageous over
intravenous injection for deep-seated infections such as bones and
prosthetic devices. Delivering vancomycin using carrier materials
was a promising strategy to prolong the residence time and improve
the accumulation at the target infection site.9,10 Various
drug carrier materials, such as polymers,11 liposomes,12 mesoporous silica,13 and other nanoparticles,14 were developed to achieve sustainable local antibiotic
administration. However, the instability in the physiological environment
and low drug-loading efficiency restricted their applications.

Graphene derivatives were favorable drug carriers for high surface
area of adsorption, and the release behavior could be modified by
covalent or noncovalent bonding.15,16 The reduced
graphene oxides decorated by vancomycin were applied to heal wound
infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus in a rat infection model.17 Our early
work involved three-dimensional (3D) graphene/hydroxyapatite scaffold,
where the control of infection and regeneration of bone due to the
controlled release of vancomycin were demonstrated.18 Graphene derivatives containing vancomycin could be effective
carrier materials. Unlike other carrier materials,19 their loading efficiencies were not fully investigated.
At the same time, other important properties of graphene derivatives,
such as lateral size20 and morphology,21 could also influence loading and release behaviors
of vancomycin. Crumpled graphene oxide possessed spherical structures
with ridges and wrinkles and was a candidate for drug carrier systems.22 The application of crumpled graphene oxides
for drug carrier was in its early stage, and no research had been
undertaken on vancomycin to date.

Herein, the interaction with
vancomycin molecules was accessed
between graphene oxide and crumpled graphene oxide to highlight the
high drug loading and pH-sensitive release. The results were based
on the detailed discussion of microstructural and physicochemical
characterizations of two graphene carriers.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of GO, CGO, GO–VAN, CGO–VAN Systems
The difference
in morphology was distinguished between graphene
oxides (GOs) and crumpled graphene oxides (CGOs). GO, which was obtained
through oxidation and exfoliation of graphite in agitated solutions,
was exhibited as a two-dimensional lamellar structure with micrometer-sized
flat sheets shown in Figure 1a. CGO was formed through the rapid evaporation of GO aerosol
microdroplets, which resulted in a 3D compressed paper ball shape
with submicrometer particulate size and rough surface texture shown
in Figure 1b. GO microdroplets
were prone to dehydration during the process of a passed-through heating
zone, and this process could generate confinement force to wrap the
planar GO sheets.23 The detailed structure
of CGO under transmission electron microscopy (Figure 1c) shows that the particulate CGO had the
intact curvature embedded with channels, which could render the CGO
extra free volume for drug adsorption. The intact curvature was inherently
derived from completely planar GO sheets and did not significantly
reduce the accessible surface area.

flat sheets of GO and (b)
submicron-sized crumpled graphene balls with (c) a high-magnification
TEM image.

The heating treatment during the
process of aerosol spray drying
would not only cause the shape change of GO but also cause a slight
loss of oxygen content.24 This was revealed
from the investigation of thermal stability between GO and CGO in Figure 2a. When the heating
temperature approached 100 °C, the adsorbed water in GO and CGO
began to release. Because the crumpled and 3D porous structures could
provide more free volume for water molecules, CGO lost more weight
than GO at around 100 °C. From 200 to 300 °C, the weight
loss was due to pyrolysis of oxygenated functional groups.25 In the same temperature range, CGO lost less
weight than GO. This also yielded the final weight remnant difference
of 8 wt % between CGO and GO at 800 °C.

and GO recorded in N2 at 10 °C/min.
The difference in remnant weight was due to pyrolysis of different
amounts of oxygenated functional groups. (b) Peak shifting on XRD

molecules adsorbed onto the surface of GO or CGO.

The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-prepared
GO and
CGO displayed a distinguished (001) peak at 2θ = 11.2°
(Figure 2b). According
to Bragg’s law, the intense and narrow peaks of GO were correlated
to the 0.80 nm interlayer spacing, which confirmed the presence of
oxygenated functional groups on the GO basal sheet since the theoretical
interlayer spacing of graphite was 0.34 nm.26 The weak and broad peaks of CGO at the same diffraction angle reflected
the internal stress caused by warped planar GO sheets. After the adsorption
of amorphous VAN molecules, diffraction peaks of both GO–VAN
(2θ = 6.71°) and CGO–VAN (2θ = 9.46°)
were shifted to the left and became wider compared to those of the
as-prepared GO and CGO. This yielded expanded
interlayer spacings of 1.32 nm for GO–VAN and 0.93 nm for CGO–VAN
as expected due to π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding
between carriers and VAN molecules.27,28 The increments
of interlayer spacing after VAN adsorption were 0.52 nm for CGO and
0.13 nm for GO. Apparently, CGO showed reinforced interactions with
VAN, which could be accredited to the morphological affinity of the
crumpled ball shape for adsorption.

The high presence of the
oxygenated groups could demonstrate that
CGO had maintained similar chemical functionalities to GO after the
aerosol spray drying. According to the Fourier transform infrared
spectra in Figure 2c, GO and CGO were offered the same adsorption peaks, such as C=O
(1730 cm–1), C–O–C (1168 cm–1), O–H (3426 and 1398 cm–1), and C=C
(1626 cm–1) bands.29 Drug
complex formation was confirmed by the appearance of N–H bending
(1502 cm–1) and C–N stretching (1224 cm–1) vibrations of amine groups,30 which was the typical fingerprint group of VAN molecules and not
found on the as-prepared CGO and GO (Figure 2d). The identification of amine groups in
CGO–VAN and GO–VAN molecules could be contributed to
the electrostatic attraction between protonated amine groups from
VAN and carboxyl groups on graphene derivatives. In addition, the
hydrogen bonding from oxygenated groups and π–π
binding from the skeleton of benzene rings, which were both on the
surface of graphene derivatives,31 could
also be benefited from the physical adsorption and subsequently delayed
the release of VAN.

Both graphene derivatives displayed a net
hydrophilicity with terminal
carbonyl and carboxyl groups in Figure 2e. The water contact angles between CGO and GO films
were 18.63 ± 0.56 and 32.49 ± 0.29°, respectively,
and the films dried from solution could display the collective organizational
behavior of graphene derivatives on shapes.32 Therefore, the improved wettability of CGO film was not expected
from carboxyl bonds that were hydrophilic in nature33 but due to the presence of crumpled ball shape. The low
wetting of CGO film might mean that the water droplet would adequately
spread between the liquid and solid interfaces due to attractive capillary
force, which arose from wrinkles and ridges in the CGO. The high hydrophilicity
of CGO could increase the possibility of interaction with the soluble
VAN molecules.

To further understand the surface property and
surface charge for
the adsorption of VAN, the ζ-potential measurements were carried
out for GO, CGO, VAN-loaded GO (GO–VAN), and VAN-loaded CGO
(CGO–VAN) systems in Figure 2f. The ζ-potential of CGO was −18.43 ±
0.90 mV and slightly lower than that of GO (−16.95 ± 0.75
mV) in water solution at neutral pH, which should be the result of
dissociation of acidic carboxyl groups (−COOH ↔ −COO–1 + −H+1).34 This could assume that the ball-shaped CGO might present the steric
repulsion and expose more surface charge positions on the curve and
wrinkles of the original basal plane. Since VAN was a potent antibiotic
drug-containing cationic group,35 the positive
shifted ζ-potentials after VAN loading were attributed to the
electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged surface of the
as-prepared GO and CGO. This could validate that VAN molecules were
adhered or adsorbed onto the surface of GO sheets or CGO particles.
The slightly higher potential of CGO could facilitate the electrostatic
attraction of the positively charged VAN and decelerate the drug release
afterward compared to GO–VAN.

In addition, VAN adsorption
was also revealed from the comparison
of chemical analysis through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements of CGO and CGO–VAN samples, as shown in Figure 3. The binding energy
peak of N 1s (399 eV)36 was hardly observed
at the survey scan of CGO, whereas the spectra of CGO–VAN were
identified as an intensified N 1s peak. This would suggest that the
nitrogen-containing groups were complexed with CGO. The N 1s deconvolution
spectra of CGO–VAN (Figure 3e) could be fitted to peaks centered at 399.2, 399.9,
and 400.9 eV and corresponded to C–N=C, C–NH2, and C–NH3+ groups,37 and all three peaks were intensified compared
to that in CGO (Figure 3d). These results confirmed that VAN should be functionalized with
CGO. The C/O ratio of CGO was 1.88 and the typical C/O ratio of GO
was 2,38 which meant that CGO still kept
a large content of oxygen functional groups. The deconvoluted C 1s
spectra of CGO–VAN (Figure 3c) were fitted with peaks centered at 284.0, 284.7,
285.7, 286.6, 287.3, and 288.8 eV, which corresponded to C=C,
C–C, C–OH, C–O–C, C=O, and C–OOH.39 Notably, the intensity of carboxyl group (C–OOH)
at CGO decreased after loading VAN, which could be contributed to
the preferred electrostatic interaction (amide) between positive amine
groups and negative carboxyl groups.

adsorption. (b–e) Detailed XPS scans showing the bonding energies

VAN Loading and Release Behavior
VAN as an antibacterial
drug was loaded on the GO and CGO carriers via the direct mix-and-rinse
method, while unattached VAN was washed out after centrifugation. The encapsulation efficiencies
(EEs) of VAN were calculated by measuring the concentration of unattached
drug, which was based on relative intensities of UV–vis absorbance.
The encapsulation efficiency profiles as a function of GO derivative
concentrations in water solution were shown in Figure 4a. At carrier concentrations under 1 mg/mL,
the overall presence of GO and CGO was contributed to the accordingly
increased VAN loading percentage. For the GO–VAN complexes,
the loading capacity approached the highest value of ca. 88% in a
2 mg/mL GO solution and then reached a plateau in GO solution of higher
concentrations. Comparably, the VAN loading capacity was higher on
CGO than on GO solution from 1 mg/mL, and the maximum loading capacity
of CGO was approximately 93% in a 3 mg/mL CGO solution. These EE results
were much higher than other carrier materials, such as carbon nanotube40 and β-tricalcium phosphate beads.41 The adsorption equilibrium state between VAN
and high-concentration GO solution could be considered as a sheetlike
surface area that was fully occupied by a branched peptide from VAN
molecules. However, the strengthened loading capacity of CGO could
be associated with encapsulation within a crumpled ball shape.42 Additionally, the enlarged hydrophilic and negatively
charged surface of CGO could further intensify the attraction of VAN
molecules through π–π stacking.

Figure 4 (a) Encapsulation efficiencies
of GO–VAN and CGO–VAN
drug complexes. (b) pH-responsive release profiles of GO–VAN
and CGO–VAN drug complexes.

The in vitro release profiles of VAN from both samples were
investigated
in phosphate buffer solutions PBS5.4, which represented the inflammation
activated by acidic environment, and PBS7.4 for a normal physiological
environment. As shown in Figure 4b, VAN was released quickly in the early stages, and
this burst release could be beneficial for containing the bacteria.43 Subsequently, the release rate was gradually
declined and these delivery systems were still released after 30 h.
The prolonged release was effective to avoid latent infections and
counter repeated drug administrations. At basic condition PBS7.4,
the release of VAN was slower and reached a lower cumulative quantity
from both CGO–VAN and GO–VAN drug complexes compared
to that at acidic condition (PBS5.4). Therefore, CGO–VAN and
GO–VAN drug complexes displayed the pH-controlled release property.
The cumulative VAN release from CGO–VAN approached around 34.5%
in PBS7.4 and 38.4% in PBS5.4 and that from GO–VAN was about
36.2% in PBS7.4 and 41.9% in PBS5.4. This might be due to deprotonation
at basic condition that would strengthen the interaction between graphene
carriers and VAN through hydrogen bonding. Compared to the GO–VAN
system, the VAN was released relatively slowly from the CGO–VAN
system in a controlled manner at both PBS5.4 and PBS7.4. Since too
much release in the initial stage would cut down the treatment time
and cause antibiotic toxicity, the CGO–VAN system would be
practical for the delayed drug release. The delayed VAN release from
the CGO–VAN system originated from the encapsulation and π–π
stacking of the three-dimensional crumpled ball shape. The robust
π–π stacking between CGO and VAN also resulted
in the limited cumulative drug release. In summary, CGO–VAN
drug complexes could be potentially applied for deep-seated bacterial
infection with high vancomycin loading for pH-responsive release.

Conclusions
For VAN loading, the maximum encapsulation efficiency
of VAN reached
93% when CGO was 3 mg/mL, and 88% when GO was 2 mg/mL. In terms of
release, at basic condition, the cumulative VAN release from CGO–VAN
was 34.5% and that from GO–VAN was 36.2%. The total released
amount of VAN was increased to 38.4% from CGO–VAN and 41.9%
from GO–VAN at the acidic condition. The strengthened loading
and delayed release of VAN from the CGO–VAN system resulted
in the morphological adsorption and encapsulation on the CGO. Nitrogen-containing
groups identified on CGO–VAN and GO–VAN drug complexes
certified the attachment of VAN on graphene carriers. The improved
hydrophilicity and surface charge found on CGO resulted from an intensified
π–π stacking between the crumpled ball shape and
VAN. Thus, the crumpled morphology was the main mechanism for the
controlled release of VAN from CGO.

Experimental Section
Materials
Natural flake graphite with an average particle
size of 44 μm, potassium permanganate (KMnO4, AR),
and vancomycin hydrochloride (99.95%) were purchased from Aladdin
(Shanghai). Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, AR), sodium
nitrate (NaNO3, AR), hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR), hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2, 30% aq.), and sodium hydroxide
(NaOH, AR) were supplied by Sinopharm (Shanghai). Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) tablets were obtained from BBI Life Sciences (Shanghai).
All of the chemicals were used as received without further purification.

Preparation of Graphene Derivatives
Graphene oxide
(GO) sheets were prepared through exfoliation of graphite.44 Briefly, graphite powder (5 g) and NaNO3 (2.5 g) were put into concentrated H2SO4 (115 mL) in an ice bath, and the suspension was stirred for 25 min.
Subsequently, KMnO4 (15 g) was added slowly, and the temperature
of the suspension was kept below 10 °C for another 25 min. Then,
the suspension was heated to 35 °C and kept for 45 min to form
a thick paste, which was diluted with deionized water and further
reacted at 98 °C. H2O2 was used to neutralize
the residual KMnO4. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged
and distilled to reach a pH of 7. The dried GO sample was obtained
by freeze-drying the mixture at −60 °C.

Crumpled
graphene oxide (CGO) was fabricated through the aerosol spray drying.23,45 The solution of GO (1 mg/mL) was sprayed through an ultrasonic atomizer
to form aerosol droplets, which were carried through a 200 °C
quartz tube by 1 L/min N2. GO was conformed to CGO as the
water evaporation of aerosol droplets. The CGO particulates were collected
from a Teflon filter, which was mounted at the end of the quartz tube.

Fabrication and Testing of VAN-Loaded Drug Systems
The vancomycin
(VAN)-loaded GO and CGO drug systems were prepared
through the following procedure. VAN was dispersed in water to form
1 mg/mL solution, and GO or CGO particulates were added according
to a predetermined weight ratio between carriers and drugs (4:1, 3:1,
2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4). The mixture was homogenized with sonication
for 1 h and then magnetically stirred for 24 h at room temperature.
The dissociated VAN was removed using extensive centrifugation (12 000
rpm) for 30 min. Afterward, the precipitate was lyophilized to present
the GO–VAN or CGO–VAN drug complexes.

The encapsulation
efficiencies of drug complexes depended on the attached VAN with GO
or CGO divided by the gross weight of VAN in solutions. The attached
VAN was decided from the deduction dissociated VAN from the gross
weight. The amount of dissociated VAN was quantified using the peak
value of UV absorbance at 280 nm,25 which
was substituted into the standard absorbance line equation. The standard
absorbance line was built upon the fixed content of VAN solutions,
which were 0.1, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL.

The release behavior
of VAN from GO–VAN and CGO–VAN
drug complexes was evaluated at two pH values after dialysis.26,27 The complex (5.0 mg) was placed in a dialysis bag (MWCO MD10), which
was immersed in 20 mL of PBS by a pH value of 7.4 (PBS7.4) or 5.4
(PBS5.4). The samples were placed in a shake incubator at 37 °C.
At set time points, 50 μL of aliquots were taken from the release
medium and the amount of VAN released was monitored by UV–vis
spectroscopy. The cumulative drug release was calculated as the amount
of VAN released from the drug complex divided by the total mass of
VAN in the complex. The average and standard deviations of cumulative
drug release were gained after three groups of testing under the same
condition at the same time.

General Material Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out on an LAM750 spectrometer
(PE Spectrum 100) over the range 4000–400 cm–1 and with potassium bromide as the background agent. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Advance).
The morphology of samples was observed by a field emission scanning
electron microscope (FEI, Quanta FEG 450) under 20 kV and a transmission
electron microscope (FEI, Tecnai G2) under 200 kV. Water contact angles
were measured using a contact angle measurement instrument (CA100C
INNUO). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a thermogravimetric
analyzer (TG 209F1, Netzsch Instruments) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under N2 atmosphere. ζ-Potentials were measured on
a Zeta Sizer Nano-ZS90 system (Malvern). UV–vis adsorption
spectra were recorded on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
2000). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB
250Xi) equipped with an Al Kα source was used to detect surface
chemistry.
