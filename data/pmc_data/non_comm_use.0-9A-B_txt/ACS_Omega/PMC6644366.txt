In
the present investigation, chitosan (CH) was supramolecularly
cross-linked with thiobarbituric acid to form CT. CT was well characterized
by UV, scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray
analysis, Fourier transform infrared, NMR, differential scanning calorimetry,
thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction analyses, and its
adsorption potential for elemental mercury (Hg0), inorganic
mercury (Hg2+), and methyl mercury (CH3Hg+) was investigated. Adsorption experiments were conducted
to optimize the parameters for removal of the mercury species under
study, and the data were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, and
Temkin adsorption isotherm models. CT was found to have high adsorption
capacities of 1357.69, 2504.86, and 2475.38 mg/g for Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, respectively.
The adsorbent CT could be reused up to three cycles by eluting elemental
mercury using 0.01 N thiourea, inorganic mercury using 0.01 N perchloric
acid, and methyl mercury with 0.2 N NaCl.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water
is one of the basic necessities required for sustenance of
life. Deteriorating water quality has become a global concern due
to extensive industrial, agricultural, and domestic activities.1 For instance, apart from natural processes such
as weathering of rocks, volcanic eruptions, and geothermic activities,
anthropogenic activities such as burning of fossil fuel, metal mining
and refining, cement production, municipal waste incineration, and
natural gas processing have also resulted in the release of mercury
species into the atmosphere.2

Mercury
is on the list of priority pollutants by many international
regulatory agencies due to its toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation
in the food chain.3 Mercury exists in three
different forms, namely, elemental mercury (Hg0), inorganic
mercury (Hg2+), and organic mercury compounds (CH3Hg+). The most severe toxic effects are caused by bioaccumulation
of monomethyl mercury (CH3Hg+), formed from
inorganic mercury, by the activity of sulfate and iron-reducing bacteria
in sediments and soils primarily under reducing conditions.4 Elemental mercury is well known as a hazardous
atmospheric pollutant for several decades.

A number of remedial
techniques have been employed for the removal
of mercury such as oxidation, electrofloatation, chemical precipitation,
ion exchange, coprecipitation, adsorption, reduction, flocculation,
and dry sorbent injection, among which adsorption has been proved
to be the most practical and economical choice for the removal of
mercury from wastewater and from flue gases.5,6 Due
to high volatility of Hg0 and low solubility in water,
conversion of Hg0 to Hg2+ has become a significant
focus in the development of appropriate mercury control technologies
because Hg2+ is more water-soluble and better adsorbed
onto adsorbent materials.7

One of
the most commonly used adsorbents is activated carbon due
to its excellent adsorption capacity for organic and inorganic pollutants.
However, the high cost of activated carbon has restricted its widespread
use. This has led many researchers around the world to search for
alternative low-cost adsorbents such as seaweed, wool wastes, agricultural
wastes, chitin, chitosan, and clay materials.8 Chitosan (CH), in particular, has drawn attention of various workers
as an effective biosorbent due to its low cost, chemical stability,
high reactivity, and excellent chelation capability. Chitosan has
been modified by several methods to enhance its adsorption capacity
for different types of pollutants.

According to the hard and
soft acid–base theory, soft bases
would be favorable ligands (mainly containing nitrogen or sulfur groups)
for binding to soft acids such as Hg(II). Ligands such as glycine,
poly(dimethylsiloxane), thiourea, and maleic anhydride have been used
to modify chitosan.2,9−12 Zhang et al. used chitosan modified
with iodine salt and H2SO4, whereas Zhang et
al. used chitosan modified with bentonite as adsorbents for elemental
mercury.10,11 Chitosan and its derivatives were also reported
to effectively remove Hg(II).12

Karthikeyan
et al. used thiobarbituric acid (TBA) as the releasing
agent during complexometric determination of mercury.13 Kala et al. developed a multimode ratiometric Hg2+-selective chemosensor system based on a carbazole–thiobarbituric
acid conjugation.14 Shahzad et al. also
reported the preparation of barbituric acid- and thiobarbituric acid-based
chitosan derivatives and used them for cytotoxic studies.15

Kushwaha et al. have investigated the
potential of barbituric acid-derivatized
chitosan for the uptake of inorganic, methyl, and phenyl mercury species.16 However, till date, the potential of a single
adsorbent for the uptake of inorganic, organic, and elemental mercury
has not been studied. To study the mercury uptake using chitosan derivatives,
chitosan (CT) supramolecularly cross-linked with 2-thiobarbituric
acid (TBA) has been synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for
the removal of Hg0, Hg2+, methyl mercury (CH3Hg+).

2 Results and Discussion
Chitosan was cross-linked with TBA by supramolecular interactions
as shown in Scheme 1. The formation of a yellow solution on mixing chitosan with TBA
under heating indicated that the supramolecular assembly was induced
by heating, and further hydrogen bond formation and precipitation
were facilitated by adding the solution mixture to 0.04 N NaOH solution.17−19

Scheme 1 Synthesis of CT Adsorbent
2.1 Characterization
2.1.1 UV
Analysis
The electronic absorption
spectra of CT exhibited an absorption maximum at 226 nm, which can
be assigned to the π → π* transition, whereas the
absorption bands at 282 and 363 nm can be assigned to n → π*
intraligand transitions (Figure S1, Supporting
Information).

2.1.2 Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Analysis
Figure 1 shows the
FTIR spectra of CH, CT, and mercury-loaded CT, and the attributions
to their respective absorption frequencies are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

Figure 1 FTIR analysis
of CH, CT, and mercury-loaded CT.

The IR peak at 3424 cm–1 can be attributed
to
N–H and the O–H stretching vibrations in CH, whereas
the bands at 1382 and 1462 cm–1 accounted for the
presence of C–N bending vibrations.

The IR spectra of
TBA exhibited bands in the 1436–1239 cm–1 region that can be attributed to C–H deformation
as well as C–N and C–S stretching vibrations.

Intense broad bands in the 3300–3500 cm–1 region can be attributed to N–H and the O–H stretching
vibrations in CT. The absence of peak at around 3600 cm–1 can be attributed to the keto-tautomer of TBA,20 evidencing the formation of CT. Furthermore, the absence
of bands in the 2600–2500 cm–1 region for
(SH) supports the presence of thione.21 The shoulder at ∼1700 cm–1 can be attributed
to the C=O group of thiobarbituric acid. The 1640 cm–1 band could be due to the overlap of C=O and C=C group
frequencies of CH and TBA. The IR bands in the ∼1640–1600
cm–1 region were broad, suggesting supramolecular
interactions such as hydrogen bonds between CH and TBA in CT. Furthermore,
the peak at 666 cm–1 indicated the presence of δ-ring
in CT, whereas the peak at 1061 cm–1 indicated the
presence of the N–C=S stretching.

There were either
slight shifts in characteristic peaks of CT or
change in intensities after adsorption of mercury species under study
onto CT. The amide III band shifted from 1319 cm−1 in CT to ∼1304, 1302 and 1301 cm−1 in CT-Hg0, CT-Hg2+, and CT-CH3Hg+,
respectively.15

2.1.3 Scanning
Electron Microscopy–Energy-Dispersive
X-ray (SEM–EDX) Analysis
The EDX spectra (Figure 2) showed the presence
of sulfur in CT, indicating the incorporation of 2-thiobarbituric
acid into chitosan. Furthermore, the presence of mercury peaks after
adsorption of inorganic, methyl, and elemental mercury confirmed the
adsorption of all of the three mercury species onto CT (Table S2, Supporting Information).

Figure 2 EDX spectra
of (a) CT, (b) CT-Hg0, (c) CT-Hg2+, and (d)
CT-CH3Hg+.

2.1.4 NMR Analysis
The NMR spectrum of
CT and proposed structure of CT are shown in Figure 3 and Scheme 1, respectively. The peaks at 2.05–2.07 ppm were
attributed to the three methyl protons of N-acetyl
glucosamine, and those at 3.18 ppm, to the 2 protons (H2) of glucosamine.22 The overlapping signals from 3.7 to 3.9 ppm
were attributed to protons connected to the nonanomeric C3–C6
carbons in the glucopyranose ring of chitosan chain, and the signal
at 5.029 ppm was attributed to the anomeric proton and to the proton
connected to C5 of the pyrimidine ring of thiobarbituric acid.15

Figure 3 NMR analysis.

2.1.5 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Analysis
DSC thermal analysis curves are shown in Figure 4. The two exothermic
peaks at 279 and 302 °C in CH and 285 and 301 °C in CT were
attributed to the thermal decomposition of amino residues. Furthermore,
no exothermic peak was observed at around 400 °C, thereby indicating
that the N-acetyl groups were not present on the
polymer matrix and only amino residues were observed, which are less
thermally stable than the N-acetyl ones.23

Figure 4 DSC analysis.

2.1.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) Analysis
Both CH and CT exhibited similar thermal behavior (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The weight
loss in the 40–100 °C region was due to the loss of adsorbed
water or that absorbed in the inner polymeric network. The weight
loss that occurred at ∼200–300 °C was slightly
less in CT as compared to that in CH, which could be due to the supramolecular
cross-linking of thiobarbituric acid in the polymer structure, leading
to slower thermal degradation of the biopolymer. The weight loss observed
at 300–400 °C can be ascribed to degradation of polysaccharide
units and breakdown of the glucopyranose ring.24 The weight loss in the 400–500 °C range could
be due to emission of volatile products, such as CO and CO2, and the formation of the carbon residue. The data has been summarized
in Table S3 (Supporting Information).

2.1.7 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
Figure 5 shows XRD
analysis of CH, CT, and mercury-loaded CT samples. The XRD pattern
of CT showed a broad peak at around 2θ = 20°, indexed as
the 101 plane of crystal form I, which is present due to the amorphous
state of chitosan. The higher peak intensity for CT at 19.93°
could be attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding patterns
and crystalline structure.25 Furthermore,
the position of the peak at 19.93° for CT shifted to 21.95, 19.98,
and 20.27° on interaction with Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, respectively. Furthermore, the
binding of the sulfur species with Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, respectively, was also supported
with the generation of new peaks at 46.55, 41.21, and 42.73°,
respectively26 (Table S4, Supporting Information) 1  The crystalline index was calculated to be
50.07% using expression 1,27 where I110 denotes the maximum intensity at ∼20° and Iam is the intensity of amorphous diffraction at 16°,
whereas the crystallite size was found to be 1.24 nm for the peak
at 19.939° using Scherrer’s expression.28

Figure 5 XRD analysis.

2.1.8 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
In CT, the binding
energy at 164.6 eV corresponded to organically
bound sulfur.29 The typical S 2p3/2 binding energy for unbound thiols was between 163 and 164 eV, suggesting
that the thiol group of thiobarbituric acid is free after layering
with chitosan.30 After the adsorption of
Hg(II), the appearance of peak at 161.7 eV suggested binding of thiol
group to mercury, whereas the peak at 163.2 eV corresponded to the
free thiol group. Similar signals were observed after adsorption of
elemental mercury and methyl mercury (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

The carbon peak at 284.6 eV in CT
was observed at lower binding energy than that for the mercury-bound
species, which supported the adsorption of the mercury species onto
the adsorbent. The nitrogen peak at ∼401 eV in CT-Hg2+ was observed at a higher binding energy due to donation of the lone
pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom to a heavy metal ion and the
resultant reduction of electron cloud density surrounding the N atom.31 Corresponding peaks were also observed in CT-Hg0 and CT-CH3Hg+. The binding energies
of the Hg 4f7/2 level in the XPS spectra of CT-Hg2+ were observed at 100.4 and 101.6 eV, respectively. The two Hg(II)
species were attributed to different coordination environments and
the electronegativity of nitrogen and sulfur atoms.32 Similar signals were observed after adsorption of elemental
mercury and methyl mercury. The mercury signals in CT-Hg0 at binding energies 100.8 and 101.9 eV suggested that mercury bonded
to CT was present as Hg2+. Detailed assignments are tabulated
in Table 1.

2.2 Batch Adsorption Studies
2.2.1 Effect
of pH
It was noticed that
the adsorption capacity did not change significantly with pH for all
species of mercury under study (Figure 6). ζ-Potential analysis of CT (Figure S4, Supporting Information) revealed that the surface
was negatively charged beyond pH 3. The results suggest that electrostatic
attraction was not playing a role in the adsorption process. The adsorbent
degraded in the medium with pH less than 2.

Figure 6 Effect of pH variation.

2.2.2 Sorption
Isotherm
It was observed
that as the concentration of Hg0 was increased from 139
to 1395 mg/m3, almost all of the vapors were adsorbed onto
the surface of the adsorbent (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The isotherm model analysis was carried
out to determine the adsorption capacity of CT for Hg0,
Hg2+, and CH3Hg+. The linear and
nonlinear fitting curves of sorption isotherms are reported in Figures S6 and S7 (Supporting Information), respectively.
The corresponding constants are presented in Table S5 (Supporting Information). The adsorption data for the adsorbent
gave reasonably high correlation coefficient values for the models
studied. The Freundlich model was observed to be the best fit with
experimental Qe values close to calculated Qe values, suggesting heterogeneous nature of
the adsorbent. The Freundlich constant n was observed
to be more than unity, implying that the adsorption intensity was
favorable over the entire range of concentrations studied. Furthermore,
the high Kf value (indicator for adsorption
capacity and intensity) calculated from the Freundlich model indicated
that all of the three mercury species could be readily absorbed by
CT.32

It can be further seen that
the Langmuir isotherm model also fitted with high correlation coefficients
0.9938, 0.9901, and 0.9987, respectively. However, the calculated Qe values were observed to deviate significantly
from experimental Qe values. This could
be attributed to a multilayer adsorption process. The positive BT value calculated from the Temkin model indicated
an exothermic adsorption process.

2.2.3 Effect
of Time
It was noticed that
the adsorption capacity changed with an increase in time (Figure 7). The results obtained
revealed that CT exhibited the highest adsorption capacity at about
3 h for methyl mercury as well as inorganic mercury, whereas Hg0 attained equilibrium on the surface of the adsorbent after
a period of 10 min.

Figure 7 Effect of Time Variation on the adsorption of the mercury
species
under study onto CT.

2.2.4 Sorption Kinetics
To analyze the
adsorption kinetics of the mercury species under study, the pseudo-first-order,
pseudo-second-order, intraparticle, and Elovich models were applied
to the data (Figure S8, Supporting Information)
and the rate constants for the adsorption of Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+ by the adsorbents are
presented in Table S6 (Supporting Information). Figure S9 (Supporting Information) shows the
fitting of experimental data with the data calculated from the kinetic
models for adsorption of the mercury species under study onto CT.

The correlation coefficients for the pseudo-second-order model were
found to be greater than those for the other kinetic models for Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, and the
calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity values were closer to those
obtained experimentally. This supported the assumption behind the
model that the surface complexation may be the rate-limiting step
involving valence forces through sharing or exchanging of electrons
between adsorbent and adsorbate.33

The adsorption mechanism of an adsorbate onto the adsorbent can
be described by three steps, viz., film diffusion, pore diffusion,
and intraparticle diffusion.34 The slowest
of the three steps controls the overall rate of the adsorption process.
The adsorption step that controls the batch process for most of the
contact time is intraparticle diffusion.35 In the present study, deviation of straight lines from the origin
was observed, suggesting that intraparticle diffusion is not the sole
rate-limiting step. A significant deviation between the estimated
and experimental values of the Elovich model suggested that this model
cannot be used to describe the kinetics of adsorption of mercury species
onto CT.

2.2.5 Desorption Studies
Desorption studies
(Figure 8) were carried
out using different eluents for the recovery of elemental, inorganic,
and methyl mercury after adsorption onto CT. The adsorbent (0.05 g)
loaded with 692.16 mg/g Hg0, 1249.45 mg/g Hg2+, and 1248.27 mg/g CH3Hg+, respectively, was
added to 25 mL of the desired eluents in a conical flask and agitated
for 180 min. The supernatant was separated from the adsorbent by filtration,
and the filtrate was analyzed for the presence of desorbed mercury.

Figure 8 Desorption
Studies of CT-Hg0, CT-Hg2+, and
CT-CH3Hg+.

It was observed that about 95 and 78% of Hg2+ and
Hg0, respectively, could be eluted using 0.01 N HClO4, whereas CH3Hg+ was not eluted using
HClO4. On the other hand, CH3Hg+ was
quantitatively
desorbed using 0.2 N NaCl, whereas about 82–85% of Hg2+ and Hg0 were eluted using 0.01 N thiourea.

Figure S10 (Supporting Information)
the adsorption cycles were studied by subjecting the dry adsorbent
obtained from the previous cycle to 697 mg/m3 Hg0 vapors and 500 ppm Hg2+ and 500 ppm CH3Hg+ solutions, respectively. The desorption cycles were carried
out for the adsorbents loaded with Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+ using 0.01 N thiourea, 0.01 N
HClO4, and 0.2 N NaCl, respectively. The studies revealed
that the adsorbent could be used for three cycles. The % uptake decreased
from about 94 to 65, 99 to 75, and 99 to 78% for Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, respectively, after the
use of CT for three cycles.

2.2.6 Comparison
with Other Adsorbents
The Qmax values that were obtained from
the Freundlich isotherm were compared with those of other adsorbents,
and it was observed that the adsorption capacity of CT superseded
that of most of the adsorbents reported in the literature for all
of the mercury species under study (Table 2). The adsorbent used in the present study,
CT, was found to have high adsorption capacities of 1357.69, 2504.86,
and 2475.38 mg/g for Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, respectively. Yan et al. have reported a very high
adsorption capacity of about 2000 mg/g Hg2+ using ZnS nanocrystals.36 Arshadi et al. reported that an immobilized
dendritic adsorbent containing l-cysteine methyl ester onto
the nanoparticles of mixed oxides has remarkable adsorption capacity
and affinity toward mercury ions in water (3079 and 3232 mg/g).37,38 Furthermore, there are no reports where the potential of a single
adsorbent has been studied for all three mercury species.

3 Mechanism
The protonated
form of TBA, i.e., HTBA, can be protonated or deprotonated
depending upon the pH of the solution.39    Chitosan could be cross-linked
with thiobarbituric
acid through C=O···HN and C=S···HN
hydrogen bonding.

Methyl mercury and inorganic mercury species
could be covalently
bound to sulfur and nitrogen group of thiobarbituric acid to form
a stable chelate.40 The binding is also
corroborated by XPS analysis.

CT further proved to be an efficient
adsorbent for elemental mercury
too. XPS studies indicated that mercury is in the +2 oxidation state
after adsorption. The plausible mechanism could be that elemental
mercury self-assembled onto CT, which further led to oxidation of
mercury to Hg2+ species and complexation.41 Thiols are known to adsorb onto surfaces of soft metals
such as Hg, Au, and Ag to form self-assembled monolayers of metal–thiol
adducts, which further led to oxidation of Hg0(aq) and
the formation of Hg+/2+–thiol complexes. Cohen-Atiya
and Mandler suggested a two-step reaction mechanism involving (1)
adsorption and transfer of negative charges from the thiol group to
the metal surface and (2) transfer of the charge accumulated on the
metal surface to electron acceptors.42 Gu
et al. postulated that the reaction between Hg0(aq) and
−SH in dissolved organic matter (DOM) may involve initial physicosorption
of Hg0(aq) to −SH, followed by S–H bond cleavage
and charge transfer, leading to oxidative complexation of Hg2+ by DOM. Possible electron acceptors could include H+ (from
dissociated thiols), quinone moieties in DOM, and O2 under
anoxic conditions.43 Zheng et al. have
reported oxidation of elemental mercury by thiol compounds under anoxic
conditions.44

4 Adsorption
Study of Different Metals
Figure 9 shows
the uptake of other heavy metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ onto CT. The metal ion solution
(25 mL, 100 ppm) under study maintained at pH 4 was agitated with
0.01 g of CT for 3 h on an orbital shaker. It was observed that the
adsorption of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ was
more on the adsorbent as compared to that on copper, cadmium, lead,
and zinc.

Figure 9 Uptake of Different Metals onto CT.

Furthermore, the interference of different metals on the
mercury
uptake was investigated (Figure 10), by taking 25 mL of solution containing 25 ppm Hg2+/CH3Hg+ and Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ at pH 4 and agitating
with 0.01 g of CT for 3 h on an orbital shaker. It was observed that
there was no significant change in the uptake of CH3Hg+ and Hg2+ in the presence of copper, cadmium, lead,
and zinc.

Figure 10 Uptake of different metals in a synthetic mixture containing Hg2+, CH3Hg+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+.

5 Conclusions
CT proved to be a superadsorbent
for Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+. The binding of mercury species
with the S moiety in CT was considered to be the main factor responsible
for the high mercury uptake capacities. More than 99% of total mercury
was removed within 180 min, suggesting instantaneous binding of mercury
on surface sites followed by slower and nonspecific binding, resulting
in high adsorption capacities of 1357.69, 2504.86, and 2475.38 mg/g
for Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+, respectively. Hg0, Hg2+, and CH3Hg+ could be quantitatively eluted from CT using 0.01
N thiourea, 0.01 N HClO4, and 0.2 N NaCl, respectively.

6 Experimental Section
6.1 Materials
Chitosan
(from crab shells)
(75–85% deacetylated) (mean molecular weight ∼ 190 000–310 000
Da reported by the viscometric method) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2-Thiobarbituric acid (98%) (molecular weight = 144.15 g/mol) was
purchased from Spectrochem. All chemicals were used as received without
any further purification.

6.2 Preparation of Chitosan–Thiobarbituric
Acid [CT] Adsorbent
For the preparation of the chitosan–thiobarbituric
acid [CT] adsorbent (Scheme 1), a solution of 1% chitosan in 1% glacial acetic acid was
prepared by dissolving 1 g of chitosan flakes in 1% glacial acetic
acid. A 1% solution of 2-thiobarbituric acid in double-distilled water
was prepared. Both the solutions were mixed in a ratio of 1:1 and
then stirred for 4 h at 50–55 °C when a yellow solution
was obtained. The solution obtained was then injected dropwise into
0.4 N NaOH solution to facilitate hydrogen bond formation and precipitation.
The obtained material was then filtered, washed with double-distilled
water until neutral, and then air-dried. The adsorbent was then used
as such as adsorbent for the mercury uptake studies.

The adsorbent
CT was characterized using UV, SEM–EDX, FTIR, NMR, DSC, TGA,
and XRD techniques.

UV analysis of the adsorbent was performed
using a JASCO V630 model
UV-visible spectrophotometer within the 200–1100 nm range.
FTIR spectra of the adsorbent (CT) and metal-loaded adsorbents (CT-Hg0, CT-Hg2+, and CT-CH3Hg+)
were obtained using a PerkinElmer RX1 FTIR spectrometer in the wavenumber
range of 500–4000 cm–1. SEM–EDX analysis
of the adsorbent and metal-loaded adsorbent was done using a JSM 5610LV
JEOL instrument. NMR analysis of CT was performed using a Bruker Avance-400
MHz instrument. DSC analysis of the adsorbent was done using a Mettler
822E DSC instrument from 30 to 550 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Thermogravimetric analysis of the adsorbent was done using an EXSTAR6000
TG/DTA 6300 instrument from 30 to 550 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
XRD analysis of the adsorbent and metal-loaded adsorbent was done
using a Bruker D2 Phaser model XRD instrument. The radiation source
used was Cu Kα 1.5414 Å. XPS analysis of the adsorbent
was done using a Kratos AXIS Ultra HSA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.
The ζ-potential of the adsorbent was analyzed using a Zetasizer
ZetaPlus 90Plus/BI-MAS BrookHaven instrument at different pHs.

6.3 Preparation of Metal Solutions
Stock
solutions of mercury (1000 ppm) were prepared by dissolving 1.379
g (98% pure) and 1.264 g (98% pure) of mercury(II) chloride and methylmercuric(II)
chloride, respectively, in double-distilled water and made up to 1
L. Working standards were prepared by diluting different volumes of
the respective stock solutions using double-distilled water to obtain
the desired concentration.

6.4 Batch Adsorption Experiments
The
adsorption potential of CT for the different mercury species was investigated
by batch experiments. The effect of various parameters on the removal
of inorganic and methyl mercury onto CT was investigated. For each
experiment, 25 mL of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ solutions, respectively, of known initial concentration and pH were
taken in 100 mL conical flasks. A suitable adsorbent dose was added
to each solution, and the mixture was shaken at a constant speed.
The supernatant was separated from the adsorbent by the filtration
method and analyzed for the presence of unadsorbed Hg2+ by the cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy technique (AAnalyst
200, PerkinElmer). The experimental procedure followed for the effect
of pH (6.4.1) and effect of time (6.4.2) on the uptake of mercury
species has been discussed in the Supporting Information.

The mercury uptake by CT was calculated as follows (eq 2) 2  where Ci (mg/L)
is the initial concentration of the metal ion, Ce (mg/L) is the final concentration of the metal ion, m (g/L) is the mass of the dried adsorbent, and qe (mg/g) is the adsorption capacity. The experiments
performed without the adsorbent were treated as blank. Furthermore,
to ensure the reproducibility of results, experiments were performed
in triplicate and the data was presented as the mean value of these
independent experiments.

6.5 Elemental Mercury Uptake
Procedure
The experimental setup is as shown in Scheme 2. A 10 mL solution
containing Hg2+ of desired concentration was taken in the
sample tube, and 3% NaBH4 solution prepared in 1% NaOH
was added to the sample tube
to generate Hg0. The N2 gas pressure was set
at 25 psig to obtain a flow rate of 0.350 L/min containing Hg0 (13.9–139 mg/m3). The N2 stream
containing Hg0 was allowed to pass through an additional
sample tube containing fixed weight (0.01 g) of the adsorbent for
a fixed time interval at room temperature. The effect of dose was
also studied where the amount of adsorbent was varied from 0.01 to
0.05 g. The unadsorbed mercury that reached the quartz tube atomizer
(QTA) was measured.

Scheme 2 Elemental Mercury Uptake Procedure
The Hg0 removal efficiency was calculated
as follows
(eq 3) 3  where C0 is the
initial concentration of Hg0 and C is
the final concentration of Hg0 reaching the QTA.

In each experiment, the mercury inlet gas was passed through the
sorbent bed into the analytical system, until the inlet mercury concentration
and the detected mercury were observed to be the same.

For calculation
of the breakthrough capacity for Hg0 uptake (eq 4), the
mercury mass balance equation was used to show that the mass of inflow
mercury was equal to the sum of the mass of mercury adsorbed and the
mass of mercury in off-gas. 4  where Cin and Cout are the initial
(mg/m3) and off-gas
mercury concentrations, respectively, Q is the gas
flow (mL/min = m3/min), tf is
the time of adsorption experiment (min), mad is the mass of adsorbent (g), and Cad is mercury concentration in the adsorbent (mg Hg/gad).

The standard deviation was calculated as follows (eq 5) 5  The experimental details of the effect of
pH, time, adsorption isotherms, and kinetics models studied for the
uptake of the mercury species have been discussed in the Supporting Information.
