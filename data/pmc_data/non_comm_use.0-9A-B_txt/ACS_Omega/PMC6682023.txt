A magnetic nanoadsorbent
with a cross-linked β-Cyclodextrin maleic anhydride polymer
capable of simultaneous removal of hydrophilic and hydrophobic dyes
was developed with high efficacy and desorption/recycling efficiency.
The effect of various parameters (concentration, adsorbent dosage,
contact time, pH, and temperature) was evaluated to assess the optimum
adsorption conditions. The superparamagnetic nanoadsorbent (SPNA)
could be easily separated by magnetic decantation and showed maximum
removal of malachite green with 97.2% adsorption efficiency. Studies
on simultaneous adsorption of dyes from a mixture were performed and
the adsorption capacity was calculated. Interestingly, the phenomenon
of competitive adsorption was observed. The adsorption process can
be fitted well into the Langmuir isotherm model and follows pseudo-second-order
kinetics. SPNA could be effectively regenerated and recycled at least
five times without any significant loss in removal efficiency. SPNA
could be an ideal adsorbent for water remediation because of excellent
dye removal efficiency in addition to chemical stability, ease of
synthesis, and better reusability.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the modern era of industrial development, environmental problems have
drawn more and more attention all over the world. Discharge of chemical
industries such as textiles, paper, color photography, printing, dye,
and food industries that comprise large amounts of contaminants such
as dyes and paints pose a risk to agriculture and the food chain and
consequently to human health. Independent of the source, a large number
of nondegradable pollutants are being discharged in the ecosystem,
especially water.1−5 Synthetic dyes generally have complex aromatic molecular structures
and are more resistant toward biodegradation and oxidizing agents.
Addition of such less ecofriendly dyes into aquatic systems can lead
to several disadvantages and hazards such as hindrance of light penetration
as well as mutagenic changes. This in turn leads to increase in chemical
oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand of water system.6−8 Therefore, treatment of dye wastewater prior to discharge into water
resources of the environment is a critical task.9

Methylene blue (MB), malachite green (MG), and rhodamine
are dyes with commercial significance and widely used for dyeing textile
fibers like cotton, wool, and so forth. These dyes are also used as
analytical reagents. MB is also used in temporary hair coloring. Although
not strongly hazardous, it still has various adverse effects on being
consumed.10 MG is a common cationic dye
belonging to the triphenylmethane and it is an important indestructible
dye. Along with being carcinogenic, the detrimental impact of MG includes
excess sweating, eye burn, and so forth.11 Rhodamine is a relatively hydrophobic dye widely used as a colorant
for textiles and food stuffs. Various physical chemical and biological
methods have been manifested to eliminate dyes from wastewater. These
include adsorption, ozonation, ion exchange, membrane and oxidative
processes, and several others. Adsorption technique stands out as
a convenient and cost-effective technique to remove dyes and for effluent
treatment, among all the demonstrated methods.12 Till date, numerous adsorbents have been developed in order
to remove dyes from aqueous solutions. Some examples are activated
carbon,13 MCM-41 and MCA,14 graphene oxide,15 mesoporous
SiO2,16 polymer-clay,17 alumina,18 agricultural
wastes,19 bioadsorbents, nanoadsorbents,20−22 hydrogels,23,24 and aerogels.25,26 Because of a higher surface area, and ability of surface modification,
nanoadsorbents exhibit greater efficiency and higher removal rate
of pollutants from wastewater.21,27 Magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) such as Fe3O4 are beneficial for environmental
applications because of the rapid dissociation of target molecules
from the samples easily by application of an external magnetic field.28,29

Despite this, there are a very few reports related to a logical
approach for simultaneous adsorption of multiple dyes. In this study,
we have developed a simple synthesis of magnetic adsorbents that can
rapidly remove noxious pollutants like dyes within few minutes to
hours of application.

In the past, we have chemically conjugated
MNPs with β-cyclodextrin (CD) using isocyanate linkages.30,31 The resulting nanoconjugates were capable of successfully encapsulating
not only hydrophobic drugs but also hydrophilic drugs.32 Inspired by these results we attempted to develop
a magnetic nanoadsorbent conjugated with the CD polymer, capable of
simultaneous removal of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic dyes.

β-CD is a natural cyclic oligosaccharide with hydrophilic outer
and hydrophobic inner cavity, giving rise to a phenomenal capacity
to form inclusion complexes in solution with several organic molecules
through host–guest interaction.33,34 Hence, β-CD-based
polymers have been utilized for removing disperse and reactive dyes
from aqueous solutions.35

For this
study, a superparamagnetic nanoadsorbent (SPNA) was synthesized by
covalent conjugation of MNPs with a cross-linked CD–maleic
anhydride copolymer. The efficiency of SPNA as an adsorbent for hydrophobic
as well as hydrophilic dyes was assessed under varying concentrations,
times, and pHs. The sorption kinetics and probable mechanism of the
adsorption were determined and the data were fitted into various isotherm
models.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of SPNA
The SPNA was synthesized according to the schematic
shown in Figure 1.
Cross-linking of CD with maleic anhydride leads to decrease in its
solubility, making it more suitable as an adsorbent. The CD polymer
(CD–MA) is synthesized by cross-linking CD with maleic anhydride
via an oxoanion intermediate by nucleophilic substitution reaction.
The oxoanion is formed because of the generation of strong alkaline
conditions by addition of NaH, which causes deprotonation of the hydroxyl
group at the C2 position of the anhydrous glucose unit. The next step
is functionalization of iron oxide nanoparticles with CD–MA.
MNPs have hydroxyl groups on their surface which react with the free
carboxyl groups of CD–MA via ester linkages to give the final
product.

2.2 NMR Spectra Analysis
The structure
of the CD–MA polymer was verified by proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) (Figure 2). The spectra show characteristic peaks of protons for free acids
at 6.36 ppm. The vinylic protons of maleic monoesters were observed
at 6.46 and 6.92 ppm. The protons of β-CD from a repetitive
unit of glucose appear at 4.91 ppm for H1, 3.50 ppm for H2, 3.68–3.82
ppm for H3, H5, H6. and 3.43–3.47 ppm for H4.36 The NMR spectra of maleic anhydride and CD are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figures
S1 and S2).

Figure 2 NMR spectra for CD–MA.

2.3 FT-IR
Spectra Analysis
The IR spectra of β-CD shows a characteristic
broad band within the range of 3300–3500 cm–1, which corresponds to the presence of hydroxyl groups (Figure 3). The IR spectra
for SPNA also show a broad band at 3461–3173 cm–1 because of −OH stretching vibrations, which corresponds to
the incorporation of CD moieties on SPNA. The absorption band at 1854
cm–1 corresponding to carbonyl stretching frequencies
is observed in the spectra for maleic anhydride. However, in the spectra
of SPNA the C=O stretching frequency is observed at 1725 cm–1; the shift is corresponding to the formation of ester
linkages. Moreover, the absorption band at 2829.6 cm–1 corresponds to asymmetric C–H stretching vibration, which
further confirms that an ester bond is formed. The peak at 1589 cm–1 signifies the presence of C=C in maleic anhydride;
the same peak is observed at 1574 cm–1, thus proving
the attachment of a maleic anhydride unit.

Figure 3 IR spectra of MNPs, β-CD,
MA, and SPNA.

The peaks at 1023 and
1152 cm–1 correspond to the antisymmetric (C–O–C)
vibrations and coupled (C–C/C–O) stretching vibration.
The peak observed at 772 cm–1 in the spectra of
both MNPs and SPNA indicates successful conjugation of the polymer
on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles.

2.4 X-ray
Diffractogram Analysis
The XRD diffractogram of SPNA (Figure 4) showed peaks at
30.30, 35.56, 56.68, and 62.75 corresponding to (220), (311), (511),
and (440) planes of Fe3O4, respectively. This
leads to a conclusion that the incorporation of polymer does not change
the crystal phase of MNPs.37,38

SPNA and recycled SPNA.

2.5 HR-TEM
Analysis
The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) images (Figure 5) show the size distribution of MNPs and SPNA. Pure MNPs were observed
as nanosized aggregates having a size range of 20–30 nm. However,
SPNA appeared as spherical and discrete monodispersed particles having
a narrow size distribution of 50–60 nm. This suggests that
the thickness of the CD–MA polymer on MNPs is approximately
20–30 nm. Moreover, image C shows a distinct layer of light
field contrast, which arises because of the polymer coating on the
surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles. This also provides an evidence
for the successful coating of CD–MA on MNPs.

pure MNPs and (B,C) SPNA.

2.6 Dynamic Light Scattering Analysis
The hydrodynamic diameter of SPNA was determined using dynamic light
scattering experiments. At 25 °C, the diameter was observed to
be 57 nm. Moreover, the particles were monodispersed, which is concordant
with the data of HR-TEM (Figure S3).

2.7 VSM Analysis
The performance of magnetic
materials can be assessed by hysteresis loop determinations at ambient
temperature using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The VSM measurements
of bare MNPs and SPNA are shown in Figure 6. The magnetic properties are measured as
a function of magnetic field, time, and temperature. It can be observed
from the M–H loops that SPNA shows ferromagnetic behavior.

Figure 6 Room-temperature
magnetization curves of SPNA (Inset: photograph showing separation
of SPNA using an external magnet).

A decrease in the magnetization value was observed in the
case of SPNA, which is due to coating of polymer on MNPs. However,
the material could be easily dispersed and withdrawn with the help
of an external magnet. This observation suggests that the magnetism
of the iron oxide nanoparticles at the core is retained even after
conjugation with CD–MA.

2.8 TGA Analysis
The nanoadsorbent was analyzed with thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) (Figure 7) for
the assessment of its thermal properties. Three stages of degradation
were observed for the adsorbent. A mass loss of 4.5 % corresponding
to removal of adsorbed water molecules was observed below 200 °C.
In the second stage of degradation in a temperature range of 200–350
°C about 36.8% mass loss is observed, attributed to breaking
of ester linkages.39 The final degradation
of 11.4% in the 360–500 °C range occurs as a result of
decomposition of CD molecules.40

SPNA.

2.9 BET Analysis
The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) adsorption isotherm
of SPNA shown in Figure 8 exhibits the shape of the type II isotherm as per the IUPAC classification,
thus suggesting that these particles are mostly nonporous or macroporous.41 Thus, SPNA has the possibility of showing physisorption
or monolayer adsorption.42 The BET specific
surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter of sample
is presented in Table 1. The BET adsorption isotherm of pristine iron oxide nanoparticles
is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S4).

2.10 Selectivity of Adsorption
(Effect of Cavity of CD)
The CD–MA polymer facilitates
the uptake of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic dye molecules via
various chemical interactions, making SPNA a versatile adsorbent.
The hydrophobic cavity of CD is likely to encapsulate the hydrophobic
dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) more than the cationic dyes because of which
it is expected to get adsorbed to a greater extent. However, the results
from the adsorption experiments show an interesting trend. The removal
of hydrophilic dyes is more than hydrophobic dyes. A comparison further
shows that removal of MG is the maximum amongst the three dyes and
removal efficiency for R6G is the least. The higher adsorption efficiency
for MG can be attributed to the small spatial prohibition for the
structure of MG molecules. This leads to rapid interaction of MG molecules
with SPNA. However, although there is availability of the hydrophobic
cavity of CD for R6G the steric hindrance caused because of the large
spatial size causes the encapsulation within the cavity difficult
and hence less adsorption as compared to MB and MG. Various other
factors which lead to this phenomenon have been explained further.

2.11 Effect of SPNA Dosage
The quantity of
the adsorbent corresponds to the available active sites and hence
plays an important role in the process of adsorption. The effect of
SPNA quantity on the percentage removal of the dyes was evaluated
at pH 7.0 for 24 h. The results of this study are shown in Figure 9. It is observed
that the maximum percentage removal was obtained using 20 mg of SPNAs
for all the three dyes. The increase in the removal efficiency from
10 to 20 mg corresponds to the higher availability of active interaction
sites because of the large surface area with the increase in the quantity
of adsorbent. Further increase in dosage causes a decrease in the
removal efficiency. This can be explained by two reasons. First, the
magnetic property of the adsorbent results in formation of aggregates
during the process of adsorption. This causes a decrease in the exposed
surface area available for adsorption, thus affecting the removal
efficiency. Second, an increase in the amount of the absorbent causes
a decrease in the rate at which the active adsorption sites are utilized
by the adsorbate molecules, which lowers the percentage removal. Thus,
20 mg is the optimum quantity of the adsorbent.

Figure 9 Effect of SPNA dosage
on the percentage removal of 30 mg·L–1 of MG,
20 mg·L–1 of MB, and R6G at 25 °C and
pH-7.0.

2.12 Effect
of Contact Time
Figure S5 shows
the effect of contact time on the adsorption of dyes by SPNAs at 1,
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min (pH 7.0 and 25 °C). It was observed
that the equilibrium is attained in 30 min. The removal efficiency
of the three dyes are different at the end of 30 min, which is because
of the difference in the interaction of the dyes with the adsorbent.
The removal of MG is considerably fast as compared to that of MB and
R6G. The process of adsorption can be elaborated in three stages;
first, the dye molecules migrate thorough the solution to reach the
adsorbent surface. After this, certain dye molecules are adsorbed
via the van der Waals force. Electrostatic interactions between the
cationic dye and the adsorbent consist of the last stage. As the process
of adsorption begins the removal increases with time, which corresponds
to the attachment via van der Waals forces and then via electrostatic
interactions when the dye is in close proximity to the adsorbent.
After lapse of time, the vacant sites cannot be further occupied by
the dye molecules. This corresponds to the attainment of equilibrium.

2.13 Effect of pH
The pH of the solution plays
an important role during the process of dye adsorption. This occurs
because pH affects the adsorbent as well as the dye molecules, for
instance the surface charge of the adsorbent, the structure of dye
molecules, and the extent to which ionization of dyes occurs.12 The effect of pH is illustrated in Figure S6. It was observed that maximum adsorption
of the dye is obtained under basic conditions (pH 9). This phenomenon
occurs because of the cationic nature of MG and MB. On the other hand,
the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged because of the
presence of dissociated functional groups. The presence of hydroxyl
groups in protonated form (OH) at lower pH values causes a weak interaction
between the dyes and adsorbent. In this case, these exists a competition
between H+ ions and cationic dye molecules, which is unfavorable
for the adsorption of dye molecules. However, on increasing the pH
of the solution the deprotonation aids formation of (O−) groups
on the adsorbent surface, thus increasing its negative charge density.
Thus, the binding of cationic dye molecules is facilitated by electrostatic
interaction between the tdye andhe adsorbent.43

2.14 Effect of Initial Concentration
The effect of initial concentration illustrated in Figure S7 shows that the adsorption rate increases rapidly
before the concentration reaches the maximum of 30 mg/L for MG and
20 mg/L for MB and R6G. The rate of adsorption then decreases and
becomes constant. This phenomenon occurs because initially because
of the higher concentration of the dye there is an increase in the
mass gradient between the solution and the adsorbent. This is the
driving force for the migration of dye ions from the bulk of the solution
to the surface of the adsorbent. After attainment of equilibrium the
decrease in number of active sites does not favor further adsorption,
which explains the decrease and further constant nature of the graph.44

2.15 Effect of Temperature
The dye removal increases with the increase of temperature. In
the case of MG, % Re increases from 87.9 to 97.2% by increasing the
temperature by 10 °C.

Similarly, for MB the removal increases
from 80.2 to 85.1% and for R6G it is from 30.5 to 37.3% as shown in Figure 10. An increase in
temperature not only enhances the mobility of dye molecules but also
provides sufficient energy, which facilitates the interaction between
the active sites and dye molecules. This causes an increase in the
adsorption of dye at higher temperatures.

Figure 10 Effect of temperature
on dye removal efficiency at 35 and 45 °C.

2.16 Adsorption Isotherms
The relationship
between the adsorption capacity (qe) and
concentration of solution after adsorption at a particular temperature
is illustrated using an adsorption isotherm. They are imperative for
designing an adsorption system and its data analysis. In this context,
adsorption capacities of the dyes onto SPNA were evaluated by Langmuir
and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models (Figures S8 and S9).    where, Ce (mg L–1) is the equilibrium
concentration of dyes, qe (mg g–1) is the adsorption capacity of SPNAs at equilibrium; qm is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg g–1), and KL (L/mg) and n are the Freundlich equilibrium adsorption constants.

The calculated
results of various parameters of the adsorption isotherm models are
shown in Table 2. It
can be concluded from the values of the correlation coefficient that
the dyes follow the Langmuir isotherm model. A monolayer adsorption
proceeds at certain homogeneous sites on the adsorbent, and all these
sites are energetically identical.45 The
results obtained from the adsorption isotherm modeling studies are
in agreement with the observations obtained from BET surface area
analysis.

2.17 Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption kinetics validates the
linear relationship between the adsorption capacity and time. Several
models were employed to ascertain the kinetics of adsorption of the
dyes’ SPNAs. Zero-order, first-order, second-order, third-order,
pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order models were applied to fit
the experimental data. Of all these models, the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order kinetics are studied in detail for establishing
the sorption kinetics. The pseudo-first- and -second-order models
are expressed as follows34    Here, qe and qt (mg g–1) are the amount of adsorbed
dye at equilibrium and at time t (min), respectively.
The pseudo-first-order rate constant is k1 and pseudo-second-order rate constant is expressed as k2 (mg min g–1).

The values of
correlation coefficients (R2) were introduced
to ascertain the suitability in a particular model. From the values
of R2 it was concluded that the adsorption
kinetics in the case of SPNA follows the pseudo-second-order model
for all the three dyes as represented in Figure 11. Thus, it can be said that the chemisorption
process is the rate-determining step in the adsorption of dyes on
SPNA. The process of adsorption/desorption process is controlled by
the occurrence or absence of chemical interactions of the dye molecules
with the adsorbent46

kinetic curves for MB, MG, and R6G.

2.18 Simultaneous Adsorption Studies of Hydrophilic
and Hydrophobic Dyes
The results of simultaneous adsorption
of MG and R6G show that adsorption capacity of MG is higher than that
of R6G. The removal efficiency of MG and R6G was found to be 94.58
and 26.48%, respectively. The simultaneous adsorption effect of both
the dyes on SPNA was determined by using the ratio of adsorption capacities
(Rq)  where qb, i and qm, i are the uptake of dye i in the binary system and monocomponent system having the same initial
concentration, respectively.

There can be three probable cases
in simultaneous adsorption: (i) if Rq >
1, synergism, which suggests that the adsorption of dye is enhanced
by the presence of other dyes; (ii) if Rq < 1, antagonism, that is, the adsorption of dye is suppressed
by the presence of other dyes, and (iii) if Rq = 1, noninteraction, the adsorption of each dye is independent
of each other.

In this case, we observe the value of Rq of less than 1, which suggests that it is
a case of antagonism. Thus, the presence of MG affects the adsorption
of R6G and a phenomenon of competitive adsorption is observed between
both the dyes. This observation can be explained by two plausible
mechanisms (i) out of the various chemical interactions formed between
the dyes and SPNA, MG forms hydrogen bonding with the adsorbent, which
is a much stronger interaction. However, R6G is unable to form hydrogen
bonding with SPNA. (ii) The large size of R6G hinders its rapid encapsulation
within the cavity as compared to MG. Hence, MG predominates in competitive
adsorption.47 Thus, maximum uptake of MG
occurs from the mixture of the solution because of its stronger affinity
with the SPNA surface.

2.19 Desorption and Recyclability
The reuse of the adsorbent is an important index for defining the
efficiency of the adsorbent. In order to assess the reusability of
the adsorbent successive adsorption/desorption cycles were carried
out.48,49 Results show that the adsorption capacity
decreases after five cycles for all the three dyes (Figure 12). The desorption experiments
were carried out in an ethanol water mixture, which is generally the
system used for desorption of dyes under study.50 It was observed that more than 90% of the dye was effectively
removed during the desorption cycles.

Figure 12 Percentage removal of
dyes after successive desorption/adsorption cycles.

The IR spectra (Figure 13) and XRD diffractogram (Figure 4) of the regenerated material
shows no significant shifts in the bands or 2θ values. The same
characteristics peaks are observed in the IR of the regenerated SPNA
as those observed in fresh SPNA. However, there is a decrease in the
intensities of the IR peaks, which may be due to minor degradation
caused to SPNA during the process of desorption. However, the degradation
does not affect the removal efficiency of the material and hence the
recycling does not compromise the performance of the adsorbent for
dye removal.35 Similar observations were
seen in XRD diffractogram.

Figure 13 IR spectra of the recycled adsorbent.

2.20 Adsorption
Mechanism
The probable interaction of SPNA with different
dyes is shown in Figure 14. The mechanism of adsorption is governed by various factors
like the structure and functional behavior of adsorbate molecules
and surface characteristics of the adsorbent. The adsorbate in this
case is the dye molecule, which is planar and can be readily adsorbed
on the adsorbent via the van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding
interactions in addition to CD cavity. Further, in the case of the
cationic dyes the electrostatic forces of interaction play a role
in the sorption process.

Figure 14 Interaction of the dyes with the adsorbent.

The cavity of CD can encapsulate
all the three types of organic dyes.9 However,
lower adsorption of R6G suggests that its larger size and hydrophobic
nature prevent any other interaction with the SPNA. On the other hand,
MB and MG are able to bind to the CD–MA polymer via electrostatic
forces of interaction, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding
in addition to the host–guest interaction with the cavity of
CD.

The elemental composition of the adsorbent prior to and
after adsorption/desorption cycles can be used to compare the characteristic
changes of dye-loaded adsorbents (Table 3).The higher content of carbon after adsorption
suggests the successful adsorption of the dyes on the surface of SPNA.
The presence of elements like nitrogen and sulphur on adsorbent +
MB, adsorbent + MG and adsorbent + R6G further proves their presence
on the adsorbent
by virtue of adsorption. Thus, it can be assumed that the changes
in the composition of elements correspond to adsorption of the dyes,
which may be due to these possible interactions.

2.21 Comparison with Other
Adsorbents
The values of maximum adsorption capacities of
the dyes on SPNA obtained from experiments have been compared with
other results reported in literature (Table 4). It is observed that SPNA has a greater
adsorption capability as compared to other adsorbents. The results
prove that the SPNA can be considered a promising adsorbent for dye
removal, especially MG. The literature values also reveal that the
lower adsorption efficiency in case of R6G is probably due to its
larger size.

3 Conclusions
In summary, this work has established a proficient and simple approach
to prepare a novel magnetic nanoadsorbent (SPNA), which can efficiently
remove organic dyes particularly MB, MG, and R6G. The results indicate
that SPNA is an excellent nanoadsorbent for removal of dyes with maximum
removal efficiency of 97.2, 85.1, and 37.3% for MB, MG, and R6G, respectively.
The main advantage of the maleic anhydride cross-linked CD polymer
is that it facilitates simultaneous adsorption of hydrophobic as well
as hydrophilic dyes. The detailed investigation of adsorption behavior
of the SPNA exhibited that the adsorption process was dominated by
the van der Waals interactions between the SPNA and dye molecules.
The removal efficiency is regulated by concentration, adsorbent dose,
pH, and temperature. The adsorption kinetic studies reveal that removal
of organic dye is a spontaneous process and obeys the pseudo-second-order
model. The equilibrium data were best fitted with the Langmuir isotherm
model. Furthermore, SPNA can be regenerated and reused for five cycles
with a slight decrease in removal efficiency and can be easily separated
by magnetic decantation. Thus, convenient, highly efficient, and technically
feasible properties make this novel nanoadsorbent a promising low-cost
adsorbent for dye removal. It can be concluded from the results that
this SPNA can be used for environmental remediation effectively.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
β–CD
(≥97% purity), maleic anhydride, iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (97% purity), and acetone were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, India. N,N-Dimethylformamide
(DMF) was purchased from Qualigens, Bombay, India. MB, MG, and R6G
were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Navi Mumbai, Laboratory Sulab
Reagent, Baroda, and Loba Chemie Laboratory Reagents and Fine Chemicals,
Mumbai, India. Analytical grade reagents were used as received. The
solutions of dye were prepared using de-ionized water.

4.2 Synthesis of SPNA
For the synthesis, CD (500 mg) was
dissolved in DMF (25 mL), and then solid NaH (15 mg) was slowly added
into the solution with vigorous stirring. Further, the stirring was
continued at room temperature for 6 h. Then, solid MA (50 mg) was
slowly added to the solution of formed β-CD oxoanions. The reaction
mixture was continuously stirred in a sealed round-bottom flask in
an oil bath at a controlled temperature (100 °C) for 1 h. To
this mixture DCC (50 mg) and DMAP (5 mg) were added. Iron oxide nanoparticles
(50 mg) were dispersed in 10 mL of DMF and this dispersion was added
to the above reaction mixture. The reaction was stirred for 24 h.
The product was precipitated in acetone.

4.3 Characterization
of SPNA
The NMR spectrum for CD–MA polymer was recorded
on a Bruker Avance III (400 MHz) NMR spectrophotometer using D2O as the solvent. A PerkinElmer IR spectrophotometer was used
to record FTIR spectra of SPNA as KBr discs at room temperature. The
X-ray diffractograms were recorded on a D2 Phase 2 Bruker X-ray powder
diffractometer at room temperature. VSM analysis of SPNA was performed
by using Lakeshore VSM 7410 at room temperature. In order to accomplish
HR-TEM analysis a JEOL (Jem-2100) electron microscope was used at
an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Dynamic light scattering measurements
were carried out on a Beckman Coulter Delso Nano. Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis of the vacuum-dried SPNA was recorded by the
model-JSM-5610 LV. The Surface area and porosity of SPNA were measured
using a volumetric adsorption system (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation,
USA, model ASAP 2020) using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at
77 K up to 1 bar. Before measurements, the samples were activated
(degassed) by heating at the rate of 1 K min–1 up
to 295 K under vacuum. The surface area was calculated using the BET
method and the porosity by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. TGA was performed using TG–DTA 6300 INCARP EXSTAR 6000
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in the temperature range of 30–500
°C with nitrogen atmosphere maintained throughout the measurement.

4.4 Adsorption of Dyes
To evaluate the adsorption
capacity of SPNA, two hydrophilic dyes, MB, and MG, and a hydrophobic
dye, R6G, were used as model dyes for adsorption studies. The adsorption
process was carried out in 100 mL conical flasks containing 10 mL
of dye solutions. To determine the optimum quantity of SPNA to be
used in subsequent experiments, different amounts (10, 15, and 20
mg) of SPNA was added in 50 mg/L of prepared dye solutions individually.
All the solutions were placed on magnetic stirring for different time
intervals, aliquots were collected, and further measured for content
of unadsorbed dye using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. For determining
optimum concentration of dyes to be used in successive experiments,
different concentrations (10–50 mg/L) of dyes were prepared
and optimum amount of SPNA was added to the solutions. All the solutions
were placed on a shaker for 24 h at 27 °C and shaking speed of
160 rpm to attain equilibrium condition. The supernatant was separated
by applying an external magnetic field and analyzed using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer at the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. To
determine optimum pH for adsorption, 10 mL of 30 mg/L MB, MG, and
R6G were taken with 50 mg of SPNA at different pH and kept on a shaker
for equilibrium study, supernatants were collected after adsorption,
and analyzed using a Jasco V-730 UV–visible spectrophotometer
(λmax = 664 for MB, λmax = 617 for
MG and λmax = 526 for R6G).The adsorption capacity,
removal percentage, and adsorption at particular time “t” were calculated using the following equations9      where qe denotes
the adsorption capacity (mg/g), qt is
the adsorption capacity at a particular time “t” (mg/g), and % Re is the removal percentage of
dyes; C0 represents the initial concentration
(mg/L), Ce is the equilibrium concentration
(mg/L), and Ct denotes
the concentration at time “t” (mg/L)
of dyes in aqueous solution; “V” denotes
the volume of the solution (L), and “m”
denotes the weight of the adsorbent (g). All the adsorption experiments
were performed in triplicate and mean values were reported.

4.5 Simultaneous Adsorption Studies of Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic
Dyes
As the adsorbent was able to adsorb hydrophilic dyes
with greater efficiency it was interesting to investigate the simultaneous
adsorption of hydrophilic and hydrophobic dyes in a binary mixture.
For this purpose, a binary system of MG-R6G having an initial concentration
of 30 mg L–1, pH 7.0 and was used. To ensure that
both the dyes reach an equilibrium, time of 24 h was selected for
these binary experiments.

4.6 Desorption Experiment and
Reusability
SPNA (20 mg) was placed in a conical flask containing
50 mg/L dye solutions individually and solutions were magnetically
stirred for 5 h. Dye solutions were separated using an external magnetic
field and final concentrations of dyes were determined. The SPNA was
desorbed by washing it under constant stirring with 1:1 ethanol and
water three times, respectively, dried, and stored to start a new
adsorption batch.57
