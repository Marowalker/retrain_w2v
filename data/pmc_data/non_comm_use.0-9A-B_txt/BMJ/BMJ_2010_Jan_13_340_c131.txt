==== Body
Jefferson and colleagues say that nebulisation is the route of administration for zanamivir.1 However, prescribers should be aware that the approved use of zanamivir in the United States and European Union is by inhalation, not nebulisation.2 3

The Food and Drug Administration recently issued a warning against using the inhalation formulation in a solubilised form for nebulised delivery,4 and letters have been sent to prescribers in the US proscribing the use of zanamivir by the nebulised route because of a reported death after administration this way.5
