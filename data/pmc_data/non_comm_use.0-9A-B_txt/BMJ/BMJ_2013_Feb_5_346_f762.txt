The authors of this Research paper have alerted us to some errors in figure 4 (BMJ 2013;346:f185, doi:10.1136/bmj.f185). The upper confidence interval for Morrison 2011 should have read -0.07 (not “0.07”) and the lower confidence interval for Van der Gaag 2012 should have read -0.27 (not “0.27”). Also, two of the studies were mixed up in the forest plot, which means that the point estimate for Morrison 2011 has been represented as the point estimate for Van der Gaag 2012 and vice versa.
