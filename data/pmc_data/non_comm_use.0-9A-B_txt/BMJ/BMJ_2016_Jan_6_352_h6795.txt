Throughout 2015, colouring books for adults have topped the UK’s bestselling paperback charts.1 In our cancer centre’s inpatient wards, colouring books are next to many beds. This phenomenon began two months ago when one patient started colouring in birds using pencils, felt tips, and glitter pens while having inpatient chemoradiotherapy. Other patients soon asked staff or relatives to buy them similar books and the accompanying paraphernalia.

Our patients tell us that colouring can make the hours go a bit quicker during the long days and nights of an inpatient stay. Comments include: “It relaxes the mind and the body,” and “While you are doing it, you concentrate only on that one task.” Two small studies found that colouring significantly reduced anxiety, tension, and depression in college students.2
3 A systematic review of randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of creative interventions on psychological outcomes in adults with cancer found evidence that such interventions can help with stress, anxiety, depression, quality of life, mood, coping, and anger.4 A recent blog by an art therapy masters student suggested that the use of colouring books could identify those who might benefit more widely from the spectrum of art therapeutic interventions available.5

Could colouring help hard working healthcare professionals too? We hope this current trend lasts because it provides distraction and seems to bring much rapport, joy, and relaxation.
