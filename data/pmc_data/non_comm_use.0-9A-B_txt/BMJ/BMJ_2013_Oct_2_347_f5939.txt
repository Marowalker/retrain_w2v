==== Body
The “Contributors” section in this Research paper (BMJ 2011;342:d3590, doi:10.1136/bmj.d3590) contains an error. The penultimate sentence in this paragraph reads: “JMV, SC, CR, and DR participated in the planning of the study, analysis and interpretation of data, and editing the final manuscript.” In fact, there is no author “CR”—this is a typographical error combining the initials of Chris Salisbury and Martin Roland. This sentence should have stated that “JMV, SC, MR, CS, and DR participated in the planning of the study, analysis and interpretation of data, and editing the final manuscript.”
