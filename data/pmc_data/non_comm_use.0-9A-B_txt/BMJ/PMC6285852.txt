==== Body
In the sensitivity analysis for the studies of DTP excluding the Papua New Guinea study
(page 4. Results; Effect of DTP vaccine on overall mortality) in this Research paper
(BMJ 2016;355:i5170, doi:10.1136/bmj.i5170), the authors
inadvertently presented the result of a fixed-effect meta-analysis in place of the
random-effects meta-analysis that was intended. The correct wording should read:
“Excluding it from the meta-analysis gave a RR of 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30).”
