We have been informed about a slight error in this Research paper by Wang and colleagues (BMJ 2014;349:g4490, doi:10.1136/bmj.g4490). From one of the studies (Leenders et al, Am J Epidemiol 2013;178:590-602) included in the meta-analysis, the authors inadvertently used data for women only rather than for the whole population. They have re-run their analyses using the correct hazard ratio for overall mortality of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.01) for 100 g/day fruit consumption. The revised pooled hazard ratio for all cause mortality should be 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98; P=0.006) for an increment of one serving of fruit a day, which is almost identical to that reported in the paper (0.94, 0.90 to 0.98; P=0.002) and hence does not affect the conclusions.
