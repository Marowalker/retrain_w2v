conditions for success
Cardiff

Work with up to 10 clinical teams across the Cardiff and Vale University
Health Board to involve more patients in shared decision making (spread from
phase 1)

Teams had access to support and interventions/approaches developed during
phase 1: shared decision making skills, decision support tools, patient
participation, quality improvement support

Newcastle

Provide tools, materials, and resources to enable clinical implementation
teams from phase 1 to continue their plans for sustainable change

Engage with four new clinical teams (two each from primary and secondary
care)

Engage with third sector organisations, providing versions of skills
training workshops to service users and advocates

Further develop tools, materials, and processes to facilitate spread of
shared decision making and to demonstrate sustainable change

The learning from MAGIC derives from a variety of sources, including facilitated shared
learning events, clinic and consultation observations, interviews with clinicians and
patients, patient and public involvement panels, focus groups, and questionnaires. We
assessed progress using “plan do study act” data collection tools,11 monthly project team meetings (including researchers, clinical
teams, healthcare organisations, and patient representatives), and an independent
evaluation report of phase 1.10 Here, we draw on
our learning from the three year programme and subsequent experience to summarise the key
challenges of implementing shared decision making and to offer some practical solutions
(table 1).

Challenge 1: “We do it already”
Changing attitudes is a key challenge for any change programme. Both structural change,
in terms of healthcare pathways and delivery, and culture and attitudinal change among
clinicians and patients are required for shared decision making and patient choice to
become routine. Many clinicians feel that they already involve patients in decisions
about their care, so often do not see how shared decision making differs from their
usual practice. A minority of clinicians view their role as “decision maker” to act in
the best interests of their patients. Clinicians’ long held commitment to doing what
they perceive to be the best for their patients is a key barrier to attitudinal change.
This is well intended, but fails to recognise that patients’ values, opinions, or
preferences are important and might differ from their own.

An essential step in implementing shared decision making is to increase understanding of
what it entails.11
13 Clinical teams need support to review
current practice, to build a shared understanding of how shared decision making differs
from their current practice, and to decide how they want to make decisions with
patients. We found interactive skills training workshops based on a shared decision
making model (fig 1) 12 helped build coherence, improving skills, and promoting positive
attitudes.14

Fig 1 Shared decision making model for clinical practice12

Workshop feedback indicated that role play based training, which emphasised practical
skills, worked better than theory heavy presentations. We increasingly included
exercises that challenged embedded attitudes and promoted discussion around them. The
teams were generally already good at recognising options and discussing them with
patients, but there was potential to improve their communication of risk and the task of
exploring what matters to patients. The training helped clinicians understand how shared
decision making differed from their current ways of working. Some clinicians reported
changing their view from, “We do this already” to, “We could do this better.”

Challenge 2: “We don’t have the right tools”
Many clinicians believe that a decision aid will itself enable shared decision making
and that decisions cannot be shared without a tool to give their patients. A key
learning point from the MAGIC programme was that “skills trump tools, and attitudes
trump skills.” Developing attitudes and understanding is essential, but then clinicians
need to consider their communication skills to engage patients in decision making,
drawing on evidence based tools when appropriate. There will never be decision support
tools for every decision; nor will every patient find them acceptable or helpful. The
skills to have different types of conversations with patients are paramount, with or
without an available tool.

In the skills training workshops, role play was particularly effective for showing that
tools may support the process but do not replace communication skills. Patient
information sources designed for use outside the consultation, such as websites, are
costly and time consuming to develop and keep updated. Developing brief decision support
tools helped overcome this challenge.15
16
17
18
19 Clinicians willingly designed brief evidence
based tools to use inside the consultation, such as Option Grids in the Cardiff
sites15 and brief decision aids in the
Newcastle sites.19 These provide short (one to
three pages) summaries of the treatment choices, the likely outcomes, and the factors
that patients might consider when making their decision, including risk and benefit
data.

 Experience from MAGIC suggests that in-consultation tools are often better at
facilitating discussion between patient and clinician than those used outside the
consultation. Some patients used the tools to guide their questions for the clinician
and it prompted them to discuss what mattered to them—the nub of shared decision making.
However, the risk is that clinicians use brief decision aids to enhance information
transfer and talk at patients, rather than improving how they work with patients. 

Challenge 3: “Patients don’t want shared decision making”
Clinicians often report that their patients do not want to be involved in making
healthcare decisions. This might be the case for some patients, and some patients want
different levels of involvement, so the shared decision making process should respect
the patient’s preference. This preference should itself be informed, rather than based
on a clinician’s presumption about what the patient wants. Many patients feel unable
rather than unwilling to share in decision making.20
21
22 Some patients think they will annoy
clinicians by trying to be more involved,23 and
their desire to be a “good” patient over-rides their desire for sharing decisions. Often
this comes from longstanding experience and expectations of a paternalistic approach and
seems to be more common in older people.24
25 This can be mistaken for lack of interest in
engaging in decision making.

Clinicians’ misconceptions about what patients want must be addressed. It is neither
possible nor desirable to make every patient be more involved, but more can be done to
make patients feel included and respected, and clinicians can often make more effort to
understand what is important to the patient. However, patients may also need support and
preparation to take part in a different type of consultation.

Patient activation and preparation can increase the likelihood of mutually useful
conversations between patients and clinicians. Patient activation campaigns focus on
changing patients’ attitudes about involvement in healthcare decisions, explaining what
shared decision making involves, why it might help, and provide interventions such as
question prompt lists. Interventions such as the Ask 3 Questions campaign can help
patients know what to expect and give “permission” and encouragement to be
involved.26
27
28

Successful implementation also needs wider patient and public involvement. In the MAGIC
programme we included patients with the relevant conditions in designing local
interventions as well as having a wider user panel to guide the broader implementation
process. The lay panel was crucial in identifying areas for improvements in the
implementation work, identifying users’ needs, and aiding intervention development and
testing.

Challenge 4: “How can we measure it?”
Clinicians and managers implementing shared decision making want to know what difference
it makes to their patients and to clinical practice. In the MAGIC programme we found it
difficult to identify or develop suitable patient reported measures to capture
experience of shared decision making. Patient reported measures are hampered by social
desirability bias (wanting to give high satisfaction ratings), and patients may also not
fully understand and identify shared decision making if they have not experienced it
previously.29 However, the three item
CollaboRATE measure (used in over 40 studies worldwide) shows promise in overcoming
these problems.30

Tensions exist between the need for validated and reliable measures for research and
measuring for quality improvement. Focusing on quality improvement helped embed shared
decision making more readily with some clinical teams. When measures directly informed
practice and improved patient care we witnessed greater motivation to improve and to
sustain the improvement (eg, the decision quality measure in breast cancer, table 1).31 Linking
with local quality improvement expertise and resources, where available, was valuable.
For example, the 1000 Lives Plus national improvement service for NHS Wales had
supported development of quality improvement skills across the Cardiff site, which was
used to implement shared decision making.32

Challenge 5: “We have too many other demands and priorities”
Changing attitudes and behaviours takes effort at all organisational levels. Clinical
teams face many competing demands and priorities, some of which are compulsory, some
even incentivised (whether financially or by targets). For example, the Quality and
Outcomes Framework rewards general practitioners for behaviours that are evidence based
but not necessarily about what matters most to patients. Tensions are also increasing
between shared decision making and clinical threshold guidelines or referral management
schemes, which are widely applied within commissioning in England. Similarly, for cancer
treatment time targets, the current emphasis is on time to treatment but patients may
prioritise time to make the decision.

Visible organisational buy-in and support are essential. During the MAGIC programme, key
organisational leaders showed clinicians that shared decision making was an important
organisational priority to drive improvement (table 1) and clinical leadership was critical to implementation. This led to greater
engagement because clinicians then saw shared decision making as something the
organisation does, rather than as another initiative being imposed on them and competing
with other demands. Teams sometimes needed support from the organisation to adapt
clinical pathways to support effective shared decision making. Shared decision making is
not the sole responsibility of doctors; it should be supported by all members of the
clinical team. Responsibility can be distributed—for example, a breast care surgeon can
explain the choices, but the specialist nurse can elicit the patient’s preferences in
more detail. It is important to share learning about what works both within and between
teams to avoid “reinventing the wheel.”

Recommendations for implementation
We have summarised the key challenges we faced during a programme to implement shared
decision making in organisations across primary and secondary care, but many other
factors also affect implementation (fig 2). More detailed
discussion of the barriers and solutions is available elsewhere.4
22
33 Similar findings have been reported in the
US.34

Fig 2 Summary of key factors influencing implementation of shared
decision making (SDM). (QOF=Quality and Outcomes Framework)

In the real world, finance, resources, and time are all scarce. Although shared decision
making is mentioned in key policy documents, such as the NHS Constitution 2015,2 it has no incentives and is not promoted
systematically at national, regional, or organisational levels. We still need to foster
cultural change among clinicians and patients, and this is a momentous challenge. A
receptive culture will truly exist only if clinicians view shared decision making as
usual practice and as a fundamental component of safe, effective, and compassionate
healthcare for patients. It needs to be embedded in the medical and nursing curriculums
and interprofessional training programmes. Similarly, much health policy and
professional practice has led to feelings of powerlessness and passivity for many
patients. Increasing patient agency, activation, and health literacy are equally
important.37

Although these actions may help embed shared decision making, they do not standardise
the process: every discussion varies, depending on the patient, clinician, their
preferences, and the type of decision being made. Shared decision making may not
necessarily result in, or depend on, complete agreement between a clinician and a
patient. Instead, it is about bringing both types of expertise together, and weighing up
the available options in light of both of these perspectives; it makes it more likely
that the final decision is informed by what the clinician knows (medical evidence,
clinical experience) and by what the patient knows (what matters to them, the outcomes
they are prepared to accept). 

We need to change attitudes to reflect this, so that patients are not seen as
“non-compliant” if they have a different opinion and clinicians are not seen as overly
paternalistic if they are listening to the patient’s preferences and considering this in
a recommended treatment plan. Furthermore, we should emphasise that shared decision
making is not confined to one patient and one clinician, during one consultation. The
process is distributed across healthcare teams, and between patients and their families,
all of whom will influence the process, especially for patients with long term
conditions.38

Implementing shared decision making is challenging but possible. No one intervention
will succeed in isolation. It requires interventions to support organisations,
clinicians, and patients: a bundle of interventions working together holistically across
all healthcare settings.

Key messages
Shared decision making is about more than tools: skills trump tools, but
attitudes trump skills 

Successful implementation relies on a combination of interventions
supporting the organisation, clinicians, and patients

Organisational support and local ownership are vital for engagement
