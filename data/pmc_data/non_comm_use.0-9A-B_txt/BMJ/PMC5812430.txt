==== Body
Some of the author details are wrong in this article by Wei Fu and colleagues (BMJ 2018;360:k234, doi:10.1136/bmj.k234). The first address should be China National Health Development Research Centre (not Health and Development). The correct affiliation for Shuli Zhao is deputy director, Department of Finance, National Health and Family Planning Commission.
