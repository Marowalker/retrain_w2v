As a result of a communication error, some grant numbers were wrongly assigned in the full (online) version of this paper by Usha Menon and colleagues (BMJ 2008;337:a2079, doi:10.1136/bmj.a2079). The funding section should include “SS has received research support from NCI (grant numbers CA086381 and CA083639),” and the competing interests section should include “SS has received research support from Fujirebio Diagnostics but not in relation to this trial.” The details are correct in the print (abridged) version.
