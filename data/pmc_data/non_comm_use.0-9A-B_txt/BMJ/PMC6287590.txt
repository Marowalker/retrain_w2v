pollution (particle diameter <10 μm, or PM10) on mortality and
explore the heterogeneity of particulate air pollution effects in major cities
in China.

Design Generalised linear models with different lag structures using
time series data.

Setting 38 of the largest cities in 27 provinces of China (combined
population >200 million).

Participants 350 638 deaths (200 912 in males, 149 726 in females)
recorded in 38 city districts by the Disease Surveillance Point System of the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 1 January 2010 to 29 June
2013.

Main outcome measure Daily numbers of deaths from all causes,
cardiorespiratory diseases, and non-cardiorespiratory diseases and among
different demographic groups were used to estimate the associations between
particulate air pollution and mortality.

Results A 10 µg/m3 change in concurrent day
PM10 concentrations was associated with a 0.44% (95% confidence
interval 0.30% to 0.58%) increase in daily number of deaths. Previous day and
two day lagged PM10 levels decreased in magnitude by one third and
two thirds but remained statistically significantly associated with increased
mortality. The estimate for the effect of PM10 on deaths from
cardiorespiratory diseases was 0.62% (0.43% to 0.81%) per 10 µg/m3
compared with 0.26% (0.09% to 0.42%) for other cause mortality. Exposure to
PM10 had a greater impact on females than on males. Adults aged
60 and over were more vulnerable to particulate air pollution at high levels
than those aged less than 60. The PM10 effect varied across different
cities and marginally decreased in cities with higher PM10
concentrations.

Conclusion Particulate air pollution has a greater impact on deaths
from cardiorespiratory diseases than it does on other cause mortality. People
aged 60 or more have a higher risk of death from particulate air pollution than
people aged less than 60. The estimates of the effect varied across cities and
covered a wide range of domain.
==== Body
Introduction
Air pollution and its negative consequences are major public health concerns in
China.1
2
3 According to the Global Burden of Disease
Study, a loss of 25 million healthy years and more than 1.2 million premature deaths
in China were attributed to outdoor air pollution in 2010.4 In 2012 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development estimated that by 2050 as many as 3.6 million people worldwide could die
prematurely from air pollution each year. Most of the deaths were estimated to occur
in China and India.5

Many time series studies conducted in Chinese cities have consistently found that
temporarily higher air pollution levels were associated with increased
mortality.6
7 A common limitation in these studies was
that the data were often from one city or just a few cities. Most of the studies
focused on heavily polluted cities where air pollution levels were several orders of
magnitude greater than those in cities with less air pollution. Therefore, the
estimates from previous studies might be inadequate for contributing to
environmental and public health policies at the national level. If air pollution
effects are greater in more polluted cities and national pollution control policies
are set based on estimates from these cities, the government might over-regulate
pollution, which would hinder local economic growth in cities with less air
pollution. Alternatively, if air pollution effects are smaller in more polluted
cities, the government might underestimate the health risks and under-regulate
pollution.

Most multi-city studies have focused on developed countries where data on both health
and air pollution are readily available.8
9
10 Estimates from these studies have had
profound implications for developing environmental regulations designed to protect
public health in the Western world. The data from the studies cannot be extrapolated
to the Chinese population because of considerable differences in air pollution
levels, composition of the particles, and population characteristics. In Europe and
the United States the daily PM10 (particulate matter <10 μm diameter)
concentrations range from 20 to 80 μg/m3. In China the daily
PM10 concentrations regularly exceed 500 μg/m3.

Owing to the lack of multi-city studies in China, researchers have resorted to
meta-analysis to combine estimates from different studies.6
7
11
12
13 Meta-analyses based on published papers
often suffer from publication bias, and their validity has been questioned owing to
incomparability across different studies. Firstly, positive results are more likely
to be published than negative results, leading to the censoring of studies with
statistically non-significant results.14
Secondly, heterogeneity in study samples (eg, the difference in age structure, ICD
(international classification of diseases) codes, and study periods) leads to
different interpretations of the coefficients in differing studies. Thirdly, the
differences in study designs and statistical methods would affect the estimated
sizes of air pollution effects, which make comparisons across different studies
difficult or even impossible.

In this study, we assembled the most recent and comprehensive data on daily mortality
and particulate matter air pollution for 38 large cities in China. For each city we
then used flexible modelling strategies to estimate the relation between
PM10 and mortality. We controlled for potential confounding factors,
such as temperature, dew point, day of the week, public holidays, and year effects
in a set of generalised linear models. Under this research design, we were able to
provide estimates of air pollution effects for each city and to compare the
estimates across cities with different levels of PM10 concentrations,
estimate the national particulate air pollution effects using the random effects
meta-analysis, and explore the heterogeneity of particulate air pollution
effects.

Methods
Study area
We collected data on particulate matter air pollution, mortality, and weather
conditions from the 38 most populated cities in China (see separate
supplementary figure) daily from 1 January 2010 to 29 June 2013. The cities are
located in 27 of the 31 provinces of China. The sampled population totals more
than 200 million.

Air pollution data
Data on daily air quality were collected from the Ministry of Environmental
Protection. The ministry reported the daily air pollution index and the primary
pollutant in all the major Chinese cities during the study period. The air
pollution index is based on the concentrations of three major air pollutants
(particles <10 μm diameter (PM10), sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen
dioxide) and provides an overall measure of ambient air quality for each city.
Supplementary material 1 in the web appendix explains how the air pollution
index is constructed and how we were able to calculate the PM10.

Mortality data
Daily mortality data are provided by the Disease Surveillance Point System (see
supplementary material 2 in the web appendix) of the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention. This surveillance system collects mortality data from
certain districts in each city it covers. Mortality data include basic
demographic characteristics of the decedent and the causes of death. The causes
of death are coded according to ICD-10 (international classification of
diseases, 10th revision) codes. Mortality data are classified by causes of
death: cardiovascular (I00-99) and respiratory (J00-99) diseases, and all other
diseases. For this study we had the daily numbers of death by age, sex, and
cause of death for all of the districts covered by the surveillance system in
the 38 cities.

Weather conditions data
We obtained data on daily weather conditions, such as temperature and dew point,
from local weather stations for all 38 cities in the study.

Model
We estimated the associations between PM10 and daily mortality using a
set of generalised linear models. For each city, we estimated the associations
from the equation in figure 1 using daily time
series data.

Fig 1 Equation for estimating associations between
PM10 and daily mortality, using generalised linear
models

Meteorological factors Zi were modeled in the
regressions through a set of natural spline functions
Si. The spline functions allow flexible
relations between meteorological factors and the outcomes. We chose the degrees
of freedom for each meteorological factor (dfZi) based on its best
prediction for air pollution levels. Using degrees of freedom that best predict
air pollution levels is advantageous because they produce unbiased or
asymptotically unbiased estimates of the pollution log-relative risk.15 The optimal degree of freedom for each
natural spline was obtained using a generalised cross validation method that
best predicts PM10 concentrations.16 After controlling for these potential confounding factors, the
data on high frequency PM10 concentrations should provide a plausible
source of external variation.

Since air pollution might affect mortality in a lagged fashion, we examined the
air pollution effects separately for different lag structures (lag of one day,
two days, etc). We also explored heterogeneous air pollution effects by
examining both sexes and different age groups.

To estimate national air pollution effects, we conducted a heterogeneity test and
used random effects meta-analysis to produce estimates of air pollution effects
for each city. In the meta-analysis we used the coefficients of PM10
and its standard errors estimated from figure 2 for each city. In a random
effects meta-analysis, the true air pollution effects (βk) are
assumed to vary across different cities and to follow a normal distribution.
Such heterogeneity in air pollution effects may be caused by differences in city
populations, local socioeconomic conditions, and baseline population health.
Specifically, we assumed the true air pollution effects were randomly and
normally distributed around a mean effect (μ) with variance (σ2). We
then estimated the variance between cities using the DerSimonian and Laird
method17 and modified the weights
used to calculate the summary estimate accordingly (fig 2).

Fig 2 DerSimonian and Laird random effects summary
estimate

Using a set of linear regressions, we conducted exploratory analysis on the
patterns of heterogeneous air pollution effects across the 38 cities. We
investigated whether estimated air pollution effects are associated with a
city’s mean PM10 concentrations, geographical location (north or
south), gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and several demographic
factors.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome
measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation
or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the
research to study participants or the relevant patient community.

Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 shows the daily mean PM10
concentrations, daily number of all cause deaths, and deaths from
cardiorespiratory diseases for each city in our sample. Over the sample period
(1 January 2010 to 29 June 2013), the daily mean of PM10
concentrations across all locations was 92.9 µg/m3 (SD 46.3
µg/m3). The most polluted city in our sample was Urumqi in
Xinjiang Province, with an average daily mean PM10 concentration of
136.0 µg/m3. The least polluted city was Qinhuangdao in Hebei
Province, with an average daily mean PM10 concentration of 66.9
µg/m3. The lowest daily PM10 concentration observed in
our sample was 11 µg/m3 in Changsha on 23 September 2010, whereas the
highest was 420 µg/m3 in Nanning on 3 February 2011. On average,
there were 8.6 deaths each day in the sampled city districts, including 4.4 from
cardiorespiratory diseases. Table SM2 in the web appendix provides more
information about these cities covered by the Disease Surveillance Point
System).

Mortality and PM10 associations
We estimated the air pollution effects of concurrent day and lagged (up to six
days) PM10 concentrations on all cause deaths by fitting the model in
figure 1 to the time series data for each city separately. Figure 3 is a plot of the concurrent day PM10
estimates and their 95% confidence intervals for each city. The estimates of the
effects ranged from 1.8% (95% confidence interval 0.60% to 3.00%) per 10
µg/m3 in Yuxi to −0.98% (−2.45% to 0.48%) per 10 µg/m3
in Panzhihua. Column 1 of table SM3 in the web appendix presents the
coefficients and 95% confidence intervals.

Fig 3 Maximum likelihood estimates (percentage) and 95%
confidence intervals of the impact of 10 µg/m3
PM10 (lag=0) on total mortality in 38 large cities in
China. Solid squares represent effect size and lines indicate 95%
confidence intervals

Although the majority of estimates were positive (87% of 38 cities),
heterogeneity was obvious across the cities. The I2 statistics showed
that 59% of heterogeneity between cities was attributable to variability in the
true treatment effect, rather than to variation in sampling. Since we used the
same model and data period for all cities, heterogeneity was smaller than that
in meta-analysis using different studies. When we rejected the hypothesis of
homogeneity, we took into account the variation identified between the cities
and fitted a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model.17 Overall, we found that a 10 µg/m3 increase
in PM10 concentrations was associated with a 0.44% (0.30% to 0.58%)
increase in total mortality.

We then used different lags (one to six days) of PM10 as the primary
explanatory variable in the equation in figure 2.
The forest plots of the estimates for individual cities and combined effects are
summarised in figures SM1 to SM6 in the web appendix. Table SM4 in the web
appendix reported the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals using the order
of cities in figure 3 for comparison. In general,
the estimates for individual cities became smaller and the heterogeneity across
cities decreased as the lag time became longer. The combined effects also
converged to zero as the lag time became longer. For example, for a
PM10 pollution with a lag of one day, the combined random effects
estimate was 0.26% excess mortality (0.15% to 0.37%) per 10 µg/m3
increase in PM10. The overall effect decreased to 0.13% (0.03% to
0.23%) per 10 µg/m3 increase in lag two days PM10
pollution. The combined effects became statistically insignificant and close to
zero for PM10 lagged more than two days. Given these results, we also
estimated the air pollution effect using the three day moving average (lags
zero, one, and two). The estimates and their 95% confidence intervals are
plotted in figure SM7 in the web appendix. The combined random effects estimate
was 0.45% excess mortality (0.28% to 0.62%) per 10 µg/m3 increase in
PM10. These estimates were quantitatively similar to those using
concurrent day PM10.

Heterogeneity by cause of death, sex, and age group
Figures 4 and 5 show the plots for the PM10 effects for deaths due to
cardiorespiratory diseases and due to other diseases, respectively. Columns 2
and 3 of table SM3 of the web appendix shows the coefficients and 95% confidence
intervals. We used concurrent day PM10 concentrations for analysis of
specific diseases because the analysis for overall mortality showed that the
estimates for concurrent day pollution were similar to those for the three day
moving average. For both cardiorespiratory diseases and non-cardiorespiratory
diseases, the pollution effect showed statistically significant heterogeneity
across the different cities. For most cities, the PM10 effect for
deaths due to cardiorespiratory diseases was more likely to be positive and
greater than deaths due to non-cardiorespiratory diseases. The combined effect
for deaths due to cardiorespiratory diseases was more than double that for
deaths due to non-cardiorespiratory diseases. For the former, the combined
effect for all cities was 0.6% (0.43% to 0.81%) per 10 µg/m3
PM10. For the latter, the combined estimate on the effects of
PM10 was less than half (0.3% (0.09% to 0.42%) per 10
µg/m3 PM10). The I2 value for figure 4 was virtually the same as that for figure 3 (59%), whereas that for figure 5 was considerably smaller (38%). Therefore, the
cities were more homogeneous for deaths due to non-cardiorespiratory diseases
than for deaths due to cardiorespiratory diseases.

dependent variable is the percentage change in number of daily deaths
for non-cardiorespiratory diseases. Each solid square represents an
effect size. Horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals

We then explored the sex and age specific effects of PM10 by including
a sex or age indicator and its interaction with PM10 in the equation
in figure 1. Figure SM8 in the web appendix plots the estimates and 95%
confidence intervals for males and females, and their differences separately for
each city. The majority of all estimates were positive for both sexes. The
combined effect for males was 0.3% (0.16% to 0.50%) and for females was 0.58%
(0.42% to 0.74%) per 10 µg/m3. The overall difference between males
and females was 0.24% (0.10% to 0.38%). Therefore, females were more susceptible
to particulate air pollution shocks.

Figure SM9 in the web appendix plots the estimates and 95% confidence intervals
for people aged less than 60 and people aged 60 or more, and their differences
separately for each city. For people aged less than 60, the combined effect was
−0.02% (−0.19 to 0.14) per 10 µg/m3 and statistically insignificant.
For people aged 60 or more, the combined effect was 0.57% (0.40% to 0.73%) per
10 µg/m3 and statistically significant at the 5% level. The overall
difference between people aged 60 or more and those aged less than 60 was 0.57%
(0.36% to 0.78%). Therefore, air pollution mainly affected older people in the
short term.

Air pollution effects and city specific characteristics
We explored the relation between the estimated air pollution effects and several
characteristics specific to each city. Firstly, we examined the association
between estimated air pollution effects and city mean PM10
concentrations. We found that the marginal air pollution effect was smaller in
more polluted cities (figure SM10 in the web appendix). The regression result in
column 1 of table 2 shows that the estimated
air pollution effect would decrease by −0.13% (−0.26% to −0.01%) if mean
PM10 concentrations increased by 10 µg/m3.

GDP=gross domestic product.

The estimated air pollution effects (PM10 coefficients) in figure 3
are regressedon mean PM10 concentrations (in 10
µg/m3), a north indicator, GDP per capita (¥10 000), share of
workers in construction industry, females in population (%), share of older
population. GDP per capita obtained from city statistical yearbooks. Demographic
variables are from 2005 micro census data. *P<0.05.

Northern China burns a lot of coal during the winter season to provide central
heating, and its weather patterns are different from southern China. We
therefore checked whether air pollution effects differed between the north and
south in our data. Our division of the north and south followed the Huai River
line (typically the demarcation used in the literature).18 We examined the difference in PM10 between
the north and south by adding a north indicator and its interaction with
PM10. These results are presented in column 2 of table 2. Figure SM11 in the web appendix compares the
relation for northern cities with that for southern cities. We found that the
marginal effect of PM10 decreased rapidly as pollution levels
increased in southern cities. In comparison, the marginal effect of
PM10 in the northern cities (sum of PM10 coefficient
and the interaction coefficient) was almost constant at different particulate
air pollution levels.

Finally, we examined the relation between the estimated air pollution effects and
several socioeconomic factors: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the
percentage of workers in the construction industry, the percentage of female
population, and the percentage of people aged 60 or more. Per capita GDP
measured relative socioeconomic status across different cities. The percentage
of workers in the construction industry was used as an alternative to pollution
exposure, because construction workers worked outside for long hours and were
among those exposed to the highest concentrations of air pollution. We included
the percentage of female population and the percentage of people aged 60 or more
because estimates revealed that air pollution effects varied across the sexes
and different age groups for each city.

The regression result in column 3 of table 2
shows a positive and statistically significant association between pollution
effects and the percentage of workers in the construction industry (6.67%, 1.14%
to 12.20%). This relation is plotted in figure SM12 of the web appendix. We
found no correlation between GDP per capita, percentage of females, and
percentage of people aged 60 or more and particulate air pollution effects,
largely consistent with the time series findings. We conducted similar analyses
by excluding an outlier city, Urumqi, which had particularly high
PM10 concentrations, and re-estimated all the regressions. The
results were qualitatively similar to those in table 2 and are reported in table SM5 in the web appendix.

Discussion
Acquiring internally coherent estimates of air pollution effects for each city in
rapidly developing countries such as China is valuable to the cost-benefit analysis
of pollution abatement strategies and for setting standards for air quality. In this
study we estimated the associations between PM10 concentrations and daily
mortality from all causes, cardiorespiratory diseases, and non-cardiorespiratory
diseases for 38 large cities in China. We employed a set of flexible generalised
linear models to obtain the estimates of air pollution effects. The specification of
the statistical model required a series of analytical choices, including the
specification of lag structure of the air pollution variable and how to adjust
flexibly for weather conditions.

Principal findings
Our analysis showed positive associations between daily mortality and exposure to
PM10 in most sampled cities. Compared with a lag of one or more
days for PM10 pollution, concurrent day PM10 pollution had
the largest impact on mortality. Meta-analyses suggested that on average a 10
µg/m3 increase in concurrent day PM10, one day lagged
PM10, and two day lagged PM10, was associated with
0.44%, 0.26%, and 0.13% increase in the daily number of deaths, respectively. We
failed to find similar positive and statistically significant effects for air
pollution lagged longer than two days. In other words, lagging of particulate
pollution had a relatively short acute effect on mortality.

The PM10 mortality associations were substantially heterogeneous
across different cities. According to our estimates, the effect estimates
covered a wide range and included both negative and positive domains, and
PM10 concentrations were not statistically significantly
associated with mortality for half of all cities. These findings showed the
limitation of past studies that focused on a particular city or a few large
cities and were often biased towards positive results.14 Air pollution effects were affected by many local
factors specific to each city. Results from one city or a few cities could not
be extrapolated to all cities.

On a closer examination of heterogeneity in the PM10 effects on
mortality, we found that air pollution had a much greater impact on deaths due
to cardiorespiratory diseases than it did on deaths due to non-cardiorespiratory
diseases. Our finding was consistent with the previous literature that patients
with cardiorespiratory diseases were more sensitive to short term deterioration
in air quality than those with other diseases. In the subgroup analysis, we
found that PM10 pollution had a greater impact on females than on
males; and that air pollution primarily affected people aged 60 years or
more.

Interestingly, the average PM10 effects from the meta-analyses in our
study were comparable to those found in several large meta-analyses. For
example, summarising 33 time series and case crossover studies, Shang et al
reported that a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration
was associated with a 0.32% (95% confidence interval 0.28% to 0.35%) increase in
deaths not due to accidents, a 0.44% (0.33% to 0.54%) increase in mortality due
to cardiovascular diseases, and a 0.32% (0.23% to 0.40%) increase in mortality
due to respiratory diseases.7

China is a vast country with more than 1.3 billion people. According to the World
Bank, the annual total number of deaths in China was around 9.46 million in 2010
(with a death rate of 7.11 per 1000 and total population of 1.33 billion). In
our data, the mean daily PM10 concentration across all cities was
92.9 µg/m3. A back-of-envelope calculation reveals that bringing
China’s PM10 level to the WHO standard—20 µg/m3—would save
3 million premature deaths each year. This number is likely to be a lower bound
estimate of the total number of deaths related to air pollution because the air
pollution effect can be larger in rural areas and PM10 is more
detrimental to human health in the long run. Our findings suggest that adopting
and enforcing tighter air quality standards in China will bring about tremendous
public health benefits.

Explanation of heterogeneity
The pattern of the associations between air pollution effects and baseline
PM10 level and city specific characteristics is enlightening.
Firstly, the marginal effect of particulate air pollution was smaller in cities
with more air pollution. This could be because of the saturation effect, in
which underlying biochemical and cellular processes became saturated when
exposed to a high level of a toxic component.19
20 It is also possible that in cities
with higher air pollution, people adopted more defensive measures, such as
reducing outdoor activities, wearing face masks, or installing air filters. As a
result, despite living in cities with more air pollution, avoidance behaviours
may have reduced people’s actual exposure. Secondly, the particulate air
pollution effects were more homogenous in northern cities than in southern
cities. This result might also relate to avoidance behaviours. A recent study
showed that people living in northern China were more likely to buy air filters
than those living in southern China.21
Thirdly, if a city had a larger percentage of workers in the construction
industry, then the particulate air pollution effects would be greater. A
possible explanation for the result may be that construction workers were more
likely to be exposed to air pollution. Much of this discussion is, however,
conjectural because the sample size in this analysis was small (38 data
points).

Limitations of this study
This study was limited by the air pollution data and study area. Firstly, we were
unable to examine the pollution effects of other air pollutants, such as
nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone owing to limitations with data.
Quantification of the health effect of other air pollutants is also important
for setting appropriate air quality standards. Secondly, we only focused on
cities, so the estimates of air pollution effects cannot be generalised to rural
areas. Air pollution, including indoor air pollution, might have a greater
impact on rural residents3. 

Conclusions
This study estimated the associations between PM10 and mortality using
daily time series data from 38 Chinese cities. Our analysis showed that
PM10 was robustly associated with worse health outcomes in most
cities. We documented important heterogeneity in the PM10 effect:
PM10 had a larger impact on people with cardiorespiratory
diseases, the old population, and the female population. The PM10
effect also depended on demographic, socioeconomic conditions in different
cities.

What is already known on this topic
Many studies have shown a positive association between daily
mortality and particulate air pollution

The air pollution effects in developed countries cannot be
extrapolated to China because of differences in air pollution
levels, compositions of particles, and population
characteristics

Despite immense interest in the effect of air pollution on a
national scale in China, multi city analysis is rare

What this study adds
The short term effects of particulate air pollution are city
specific, therefore estimates obtained from one city should not
be generalised to all cities

In China the effects of particulate air pollution are smaller in
cities with more air pollution and are more homogenous in
northern cities than in southern cities
