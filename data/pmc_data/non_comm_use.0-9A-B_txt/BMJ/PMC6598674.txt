Muktar Aliyu and colleagues discuss barriers, enablers, and research
gaps in engaging male partners in prevention of vertical HIV transmission in
sub-Saharan Africa
==== Body
Ending vertical transmission of HIV, or maternal-to-infant passage of HIV during pregnancy,
labour, or postpartum, in sub-Saharan Africa will require innovations beyond current
biomedical tools. Available evidence indicates that involvement of male partners in
vertical transmission prevention programmes is such an innovation. Support from a male
partner is associated with enhanced maternal HIV testing during pregnancy, increased
initiation and adherence to maternal antiretroviral therapy, improved HIV communication and
prevention among couples, and decreased vertical transmission, with attendant increase in
HIV-free infant survival.1
2


Stagnation in progress on the reduction in vertical transmission in parts of sub-Saharan
Africa,2 coupled with greater numbers of people
living with HIV and advances in antiretroviral therapy, increase the need to accelerate the
scale-up of effective strategies. Despite the prioritisation of active engagement of male
partners in many sub-Saharan Africa countries, explicit implementation guidelines are
largely absent in national policy documents.3
Variability of definitions and strategies of male partner engagement, coupled with wide
differences in sociocultural contexts, complicate the translation of research into policy
and practice. We synthesise what is known about successful male partner involvement
interventions for prevention of vertical transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, highlight
implementation challenges, and identify questions for further research.

Challenges in studying male partner involvement
Low background levels of male partner involvement in antenatal care
The first step in the vertical transmission prevention cascade is maternal HIV
testing and counselling at antenatal care clinics. Many countries in sub-Saharan
Africa have persistently low attendance by antenatal care among women and men. For
example, in Nigeria, only 51% of pregnant women meet World Health Organization
recommendations of at least four antenatal care visits.4 Data on male antenatal care attendance are often not collected
or reported; measures are typically based on the number of male partners attending at
least one antenatal care visit. Barriers to male attendance at and involvement in
antenatal care and vertical transmission prevention services operate at multiple
levels: community (for example, gender norms/roles in reproductive health, HIV
related stigma), health system (for example, female oriented services, negative
provider attitudes), interpersonal (for example, couple mistrust, disclosure issues),
and individual (for example, poor maternal knowledge of child health, fear of HIV
related stigma).5
6
7
8 These factors similarly limit male
involvement in subsequent steps on the vertical transmission prevention cascade.

Varied sociocultural contexts, including gender roles and power dynamics
Different sociocultural contexts and norms within and between countries highlight
difficulties in generalising specific approaches to male involvement in maternal
healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. These variations include gender roles, social
expectations and traditions in reproduction and childcare, cultural systems such as
family structures (including polygamous unions), and the role of the extended family
in reproductive decision making.9


Issues surrounding gender roles and power are especially relevant and serve as
barriers to both male and female participation in maternal health services.
Socioculturally entrenched expectations typically feminise participation in antenatal
services and masculinise decision making.8
9 Hence, men often avoid participating and
women may defer critical decisions exclusively to men. Fear of intimate partner
violence may be part of a dysfunctional dynamic, leading women to decline HIV testing
or antiretroviral therapy. Yet, accountability for maternal health service uptake and
adverse outcomes is largely shouldered by women.9


Measurement challenges, including varying definitions for male partner
involvement
Defining and measuring male involvement is important for evaluating the effect of
male involvement on services for prevention of vertical HIV transmission and
comparing findings across studies. Many definitions of for male partner involvement
have been used in the literature. A commonly used definition denotes men having
adequate knowledge of, and participation in, maternal health related activities and
acting as supportive partners in decision making for improved maternal and child
outcomes.6 Possible measures of
involvement include antenatal HIV testing of male partners; couples’ HIV counselling
and testing; and male attendance at antenatal care, deliveries, or postpartum
visits.1
2
6
10 A composite indicator has been developed
based on an “involvement index” of several factors, including male attendance at
antenatal care, HIV testing, maternal economic support, knowledge and awareness of
antenatal care services, and participation in contraception decision making.6
11 Other challenges include the lack of data
on the ideal “level” of male partner engagement and failure to account for the
variation in male partner involvement over time. The logical follow-up question
therefore arises: what level of male engagement are policy makers striving to achieve
to end vertical transmission and optimise outcomes for the mother, her partner, and
their child?

Male partner involvement strategies as a component of bundled
interventions
Male engagement activities are increasingly being integrated into vertical
transmission prevention programmes as components of bundled interventions.10 However, this makes it difficult to
attribute any effect seen on outcomes to male engagement strategies. A multisite
Mozambique study engaged traditional birth attendants to deliver health services to
pregnant women, trained community based male counsellors, created private rooms for
couples having counselling and testing, and implemented community based theatre to
destigmatise male partner support.5 Although
the intervention increased male partner engagement from 5% to 34% (defined as partner
accompaniment to antenatal care services at least once), it was not possible to
identify which components were most successful.5 Bundled interventions can also be inefficient, as not all participants
may need the same intensity of interventions and some individuals may receive
services that they do not need.

Unintended effects
Women should be the final arbiters of their preferred level of male partner
engagement. Some women may fear loss of privacy or autonomy if men cross into their
“space.” These women may be most comfortable managing their care independently, while
others benefit from partner support. Male involvement strategies should also be
designed to minimise potential negative effects of increasing male participation.
Such negative effects could include decreased exclusive breastfeeding or early
breastfeeding cessation, intimate partner violence, or pressure to alter a woman’s
health service preferences.12 These effects
could have unintended consequences on uptake of maternal services and overall
maternal and child health. In extreme cases, denying antenatal care services to women
who present without male partners (whether by protocol or by overzealous
practitioners) can discourage uptake and hinder access to early initiation of
maternal care.9

Available evidence from individual studies

Bundled interventions that integrate male partner involvement showed
effectiveness in a 2017 meta-analysis that included four randomised controlled trials
and 13 observational studies.10 In Nigeria, a
cluster randomised controlled trial of bundled interventions (male involvement, task
shifting, point-of-care CD4 testing, and integrated postpartum maternal and child health
services) increased antiretroviral therapy uptake, maternal and infant retention in
care, and HIV-free infant survival.14 In rural
Mozambique, trained male-to-male counsellors and traditional birth attendants were
associated with increased uptake of counselling, testing, and antiretroviral therapy
among pregnant women.5 In Kenya, a bundled
intervention focused on demand creation (eg, community mobilisation), use of technology
(eg, text reminders to male partners), and service delivery innovations (eg, invitation
letters). The intervention was associated with improved linkage to HIV care, decreased
time to initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and increased facility based delivery
among pregnant women.2 The use of community
liaison officers such as community health workers and male champions can also affect the
effectiveness of bundled interventions.14 The
dearth of cost effectiveness analyses, however, limits conclusions regarding the
usefulness of these bundled interventions.


Psychosocial approaches to increasing male partner involvement,
including peer facilitated support groups and cognitive behavioural approaches, have
increased male antenatal care attendance with improved maternal outcomes.8
10 For example, the PartnerPlus intervention in
South Africa comprised weekly sessions for pregnant women and their partners to improve
interpersonal communication skills, medication adherence, HIV knowledge, condom use, and
disclosure.15 The study found an increase in
knowledge of HIV and vertical transmission prevention.15



Verbal encouragement by clinic providers may motivate pregnant women to
bring male partners to antenatal care.1
16 One study found that verbal invitations to
male partners had positive effects on rates of partner return and couple HIV counselling
and testing7. In Malawi, verbal encouragement
improved condom use and maternal retention in care but not maternal uptake of
antiretroviral therapy.16



Provider assisted partner invitation via letter is widely used to
promote male involvement.7
8
17
18
19 At least two randomised controlled trials
have shown an impact on male involvement,17
18 although invitation letters may not have
improved uptake of maternal or infant antiretroviral therapy.10
19 Jefferys et al reported that use of
invitation letters resulted in comparatively higher rates of male partner antenatal care
attendance at rural versus urban facilities in Tanzania.20 Similarly, work in South Africa found letters particularly
motivational if focused on fatherhood and primary healthcare, rather than HIV
testing.21



Community education and sensitisation—Limited knowledge of vertical
transmission risk can hinder men’s participation.7
8 Education and sensitisation programmes
engaging community leaders and men as role models can increase vertical transmission
knowledge and awareness among men, combat negative attitudes,3 and improve healthcare engagement.5 The effect of such initiatives may not be limited to vertical
transmission prevention. In Tanzania, a community focused lifesaving skills curriculum
significantly increased male partner involvement in maternal health (defined by a
composite indicator) from 39% to 81%.22
Community education and sensitisation campaigns must focus on sustaining behaviour
change; in Mozambique a community based programme resulted in long term engagement.5


Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses
High quality evidence— for example, from randomised studies—on the effect of male
partner involvement on vertical transmission prevention outcomes is lacking. Study
heterogeneity also makes it challenging to reliably pool findings for meta-analyses. A
Cochrane review23 included only one eligible
study, which provided invitation letters to pregnant women with an unexpected negative
effect on uptake of a vertical transmission prevention service. Takah and colleagues
included 17 articles, also finding that invitation letters were ineffective in improving
male partner involvement.10 The most effective
strategies were psychosocial approaches delivered by trained personnel and complex
community interventions (table 1). 10 A systematic review assessing barriers and
facilitators to male engagement showed that one major barrier is the societal perception
that maternal health related services are “women’s activities.”8 Facilitators were related to health system or community
interventions, including sensitisation education, provider encouragement, invitation
letters, couples’ discussions, and male partner counselling and testing outside the
antenatal care setting. Predictors of male involvement included monogamous marriage or
cohabitation, HIV seroconcordance, and female partners’ financial dependence on men
(table 1).8 A systematic review of 28 studies from sub-Saharan Africa found that
whereas few papers looked at the perceived role of men in vertical transmission
services, most included considerations of barriers and enablers to male
participation.24

† Most influential/impactful findings overall

What changes do national HIV programmes need to institute?
While acknowledging the need to adapt to sociocultural context, evidence suggests that
interventions should target three key factors: community education on vertical
transmission, particularly tackling norms regarding male participation in maternal
services; community based counselling of male partners to encourage and support maternal
antenatal care attendance; and availability of trained health providers, private space,
and couples based counselling and testing services within health facilities.
Additionally, male partner engagement should not be tied to maternal HIV status; women
should not be penalised if their partners do not participate; and neither should women
be solely responsible for their partner’s participation. Governments should support male
engagement initiatives by enabling structural and policy changes, including prioritising
funding and implementation of such initiatives. Public policies should also promote the
engagement of community leaders as change agents to tackle socioeconomic and cultural
norms that impede vertical transmission prevention.

Further research
Further research should focus on reducing harmful gender norms and practices and the
stigma associated with men attending maternal health services (box 1). In addition, several approaches to
increase male partner attendance in antenatal care have been tested, but there is little
consensus about how strategies should be tailored to specific conditions (rural versus
urban; married versus cohabiting couples; strength of relationship; and so on). We lack
data about what constitutes male partner involvement and what level of engagement is
sufficient to maximise women’s uptake of vertical transmission prevention services.11 Simple, male targeted interventions such as
peer psychosocial initiatives show promise as standalone strategies, but like others,
they are effective only if developed in partnership with community stakeholders,
including women. Lastly, cost effectiveness analyses of such interventions are essential
to justify the efficient use of increasingly limited PEFPAR, Global Fund, or national
health system funds.

Key messages
Interventions to increase male engagement in vertical transmission prevention
need adaptation to local sociocultural contexts

Vertical transmission prevention should include improving community level
education on vertical transmission and reframing cultural norms to include men
in prenatal care

A substantial gap exists in vertical transmission knowledge, including a lack
of consensus about definitions of male partner engagement and a paucity of
rigorous cost effectiveness data
