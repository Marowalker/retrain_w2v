In the results section in the full (online) version of this article by Michael Moore and colleagues (BMJ 2009;339:b3999, doi:10.1136/bmj.b3999), we overstated by a factor of 10 the percentages given for the incidence of new cases of depression in 1993: the values should be 1.58% for women and 0.78% for men. The percentages for incidence in the whole cohort compared with those in the stable practices are also overstated by a factor of 10: the values should be 0.93% versus 0.78% for men and 1.83% versus 1.58% for women.
