The BMJ would like to apologise for not acknowledging the source for the cover illustration of the 22 June 2013 issue, which also appears in this Analysis article in print and as a black and white illustration online (BMJ 2013;346:f2865, doi:10.1136/bmj.f2865). Although Paul Boston is the actual cover artist, as credited in print, and Ronan Haughey re-drew the black and white illustration online, Yuko Hara is the original artist whose drawing served as a model for both illustrations with her permission. The original drawing Yuko Hara supplied to us can be found below.
