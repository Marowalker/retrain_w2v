forces who took part in tests of chemical warfare agents from 1941 to 1989.

Design Historical cohort study, with cohort members followed up to
December 2004.

Data source Archive of UK government research facility at Porton
Down, UK military personnel records, and national death and cancer records.

Participants All veterans included in the cohort study of mortality,
excluding those known to have died or been lost to follow-up before 1 January
1971 when the UK cancer registration system commenced: 17 013 male members of
the UK armed forces who took part in tests (Porton Down veterans) and a similar
group of 16 520 men who did not (non-Porton Down veterans).

Main outcome measures Cancer morbidity in each group of veterans;
rate ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for age group and calendar
period.

Results 3457 cancers were reported in the Porton Down veterans
compared with 3380 cancers in the non-Porton Down veterans. While overall cancer
morbidity was the same in both groups (rate ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval
0.95 to 1.05), Porton Down veterans had higher rates of ill defined malignant
neoplasms (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22), in situ neoplasms (1.45, 1.06 to 2.00), and
those of uncertain or unknown behaviour (1.32, 1.01 to 1.73).

Conclusion Overall cancer morbidity in Porton Down veterans was no
different from that in non-Porton Down veterans.
==== Body
Introduction
After the first world war, research conducted at the chemical defence establishment
at Porton Down included a “human volunteer programme” and members of the armed
forces took part in experiments studying the potential impact of chemical agents on
military capability and the effectiveness of protective measures.1
2 Between 1941 and 1989, over 18 000 members
of the armed forces were recorded as having taken part in this programme. Over 50%
of these veterans were recorded as taking part in tests involving chemicals that are
known or probable human carcinogens, the most common being dermal exposures to
sulphur mustard.3 While their overall cancer
mortality was similar to that of veterans who did not take part in tests at Porton
Down,4 past exposure to these chemicals
might have affected their risk of developing common cancers with relatively good
survival such as certain skin cancers. We report here on cancer morbidity in Porton
Down veterans by studying cancers reported for the period from 1971, when the UK
cancer registration system commenced, to 2004.

Methods
Information provided here focuses on aspects relevant to cancer morbidity. More
details of the methods used are provided elsewhere.4

Study population
We considered for inclusion all veterans included in the cohort study of
mortality.4 Porton Down veterans
were all male members of the British armed forces recorded as having
participated in tests between 1 April 1941 and 31 December 1989, while
non-Porton Down veterans were other similar members of the armed forces not
recorded as having taken part in tests at Porton Down.4 We excluded veterans known to have died or been lost to
follow-up before 1 January 1971.

Follow-up
We obtained death certificates, notifications of emigrations, and data on cancers
registered since 1 January 1971 from the National Health Service central
registers.4 Each condition listed on
death certificates as causing or contributing to death was coded by the Office
for National Statistics according to ICD-10 (international classification of
diseases, 10th revision). Cancer registration data for all cancers registered on
or after 1 January 1971 were provided electronically and included date of
diagnosis and cancer site or type coded according to the ICD coding system at
the time of registration (ICD-8, 9, or 10). The research team recoded ICD-8 and
ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes.

Classification of chemical exposures
We used contemporaneous experimental records of tests carried out as part of the
“human volunteer programme” in the Porton Down historical archive to
retrospectively assess exposure.3
5 Data abstraction involved linking,
when possible, each test to an individual veteran and the classification of that
test as involving a chemical or not. The type of chemical was recorded as being
a vesicant (blistering agent), a nerve agent, or other chemical. There were
eight specific chemicals for which there were records of at least 1000 Porton
Down veterans having been tested: three vesicants (sulphur mustard, Lewisite,
and nitrogen mustard), one nerve agent (sarin), two lachrymators (CS and CR),
and two anti-nerve agent pharmaceutical chemicals (pralidoxime and atropine).
Two of these chemicals have been classified by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) as either a known (sulphur mustard and cancer of the
upper and lower respiratory tract) or probable (nitrogen mustard and squamous
cell carcinoma of the skin) human carcinogen.6 We also considered benzene, a chemical classified by IARC as a
leukaemogen6 and used as a diluent
in tests in 994 veterans.3

Of the veterans recorded as being exposed to sulphur mustard, 74% of those in the
analyses of cancer morbidity could be classified according to cumulative
exposure. Veterans exposed to a total of ≥10.63 mg of sulphur mustard were
classified as having “high” exposures.3
Equivalent classifications were possible for 66% of veterans exposed to Lewisite
and 75% of those exposed to nitrogen mustard, the corresponding “high” exposure
levels being ≥13.69 mg and ≥23.73 mg, respectively.3 For 93% of tests involving sulphur mustard, we could
classify veterans according to the biological effect recorded, equivalent
figures being 98% for Lewisite and 83% for nitrogen mustard. Veterans with a
least one dermal vesicle or a necrosed area recorded after tests involving these
vesicants were classified as having had an exposure with at least one “high”
biological effect. The derivation of these groups, and of similar groups for
nerve agent exposures, is described elsewhere.3 For chemicals other than vesicants or nerve agents, we collected
information on the number of tests recorded.

Statistical analysis
All veterans included in the previously reported mortality analysis as alive and
under follow-up on or after 1 January 1971 contributed to the analysis. The
primary method involved comparing registration rates in Porton Down veterans
with those of non-Porton Down veterans by calculating rate ratios. For each
Porton Down veteran, we counted person years of follow-up from 1 January 1971 or
the earliest subsequent date that they were first recorded as being included in
a test. For non-Porton Down veterans, we counted person years from the date
derived by adding to their enlistment date the time between enlistment and first
attendance at Porton Down for the veteran for whom they had been selected. For
each specific cancer site or type, person years stopped at the earliest of date
of registration of the first cancer, death, loss to follow-up, or 31 December
2004. For veterans lost to follow-up, person years stopped at the last date they
were known to be alive (such as date of emigration or discharge from the
services). When we compared rates in Porton Down and non-Porton Down veterans we
included cancers identified only from the death certificate. For cancers
identified in this way, we used the date of death as the date of cancer
registration.

Rate ratios were estimated for all neoplasms combined and according to type
(malignant, in situ, benign, uncertain or unknown behaviour). For malignant
neoplasms, we also estimated rate ratios separately for 16 predetermined cancer
sites or types. Veterans with more than one cancer of the same site or type had
only the first cancer counted while those with cancers registered for two or
more different types (such as primary cancers of skin and bladder) contributed a
cancer to each. We calculated person years separately for each cancer site or
type stratified according to 15 five year age groups (15-19, 20-25, etc, to ≥85)
and five year calendar periods (1971-4, 1975-9, etc, to 2000-4). All rate ratios
were adjusted for age group and calendar period and estimated with 95%
confidence intervals, and P values calculated, with the Mantel-Haenszel
method.7 When the number of cancers
expected in either group of veterans was less than 10, we estimated adjusted
rate ratios and tested for significance by fitting exact conditional Poisson
regression models to the stratified data.8

We also compared rates of cancer in each group of veterans with rates in England
and Wales, using only those cancers notified from registrations. We counted
person years from the same date as that used for rate ratio calculations but
stopped at the date when the veteran was last known to be alive in the UK. We
stratified person years of follow-up according to 15 five year age groups
(15-19, 20-24, etc, to ≥85) and by single calendar year (from 1941 to 2004).
Expected registrations were calculated by multiplying the person years for each
five year age group and single calendar year by the corresponding registration
rates for England and Wales. Standardised registration ratios were estimated
from the ratio of observed to expected registrations. We obtained 95% confidence
intervals and P values using the normal approximation to the Poisson
distribution.8

Analyses reported here relate to 17 013 Porton Down veterans, and 16 520
non-Porton Down veterans, all of whom were included in mortality analyses.4 Updating of databases after the
mortality analysis removed two Porton Down veterans and four non-Porton Down
veterans from the analysis but added three non-Porton Down veterans. All
analyses were performed with Stata 10 (www.stata.com). All tests of significance
were two sided.

Results
Of the veterans included in the mortality analysis, 93% (17 013/18 276) of Porton
Down veterans and 94% (16 520/17 600) of non-Porton Down veterans contributed data
to analyses on cancer morbidity. Of those excluded from analyses, in over 60% of
Porton Down (796/1263) and non-Porton Down veterans (703/1,080) this was because
they had died between 1941 and 1970. Service at enlistment and other characteristics
were similar to that of non-Porton Down veterans (table 1). As in the mortality study, Porton Down veterans had a longer total
duration of military service. The distribution of Porton Down veterans according to
frequency, calendar period, and type of chemical test was also similar to that
reported previously (table 2).

The number of men with one or more cancer registrations was 3029 in Porton Down
veterans and 3015 in non-Porton Down veterans. We identified a further 530 veterans
with cancer from death certificates (259 and 271). The total number of cancers
recorded in each group was 3457 and 3380, respectively. The percentage with two or
more registrations was slightly larger in Porton Down than non-Porton Down veterans:
12.3% (374/3029) v 10.6% (320/3015).

Overall, rates for all neoplasms were the same in both groups of veterans (rate ratio
1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.05) as were those for all malignant
neoplasms (0.99, 0.94 to 1.04) (table 3). Porton
Down veterans had higher rates of ill defined, secondary, or unspecified malignant
neoplasms (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22), in situ neoplasms (1.45, 1.06 to 2.00), and those of
uncertain or unknown behaviour (1.32, 1.01 to 1.73) and lower rates of skin cancer
other than melanoma (0.87, 0.77 to 0.99). Some neoplasms classified as in situ or of
uncertain or unknown behaviour (16 in Porton Down and 10 in non-Porton Down
veterans) were non-melanoma skin cancers. When we combined these with malignant skin
cancers other than melanoma, the rate ratio for this cancer site increased only
slightly (0.89, 0.78 to 1.01).

Rate ratios for all neoplasms and all malignant neoplasms were just below unity for
veterans exposed to tests involving any vesicant, sulphur mustard, or nitrogen
mustard and just above unity for Lewisite (fig 1).
Veterans exposed to Lewisite had rates of cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung
25% higher than non-Porton Down veterans (1.25, 1.05 to 1.48, P=0.01). Porton Down
veterans exposed to tests involving any nerve agent, sarin, or any chemical other
than nerve agents or vesicants had rate ratios for all neoplasms and all malignant
neoplasms just below unity (figs 2 and 3)
. The rate of
cancer of the oesophagus was raised in veterans exposed to CS (2.17, 1.04 to 4.52,
P=0.03).

Table 4 shows results for veterans classified as
having had high levels of exposure or biological effect either for chemicals with
previous evidence of carcinogenicity (such as sulphur mustard for cancers of the
trachea, bronchus, and lung) or where rate ratios were raised in Porton Down
veterans (such as for CS and oesophageal cancer). When we compared the resultant
estimates of rate ratios to the results for all exposed Porton Down veterans, in
nearly all cases the estimate obtained was lower or similar to that obtained for all
veterans. The only instance where the estimate for the high exposure group was above
the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for all veterans was for skin cancers
other than melanoma in relation to high dermal exposure to nitrogen mustard (1.59,
0.97 to 2.61, v 1.13, 0.82 to 1.57). For veterans with a dermal
vesicle recorded (high biological effect), however, the rate ratio estimate was
lower than that of all exposed veterans (1.05, 0.59 to 1.87).

Corresponding results for non-Porton Down veterans were 0.87 (0.85 to 0.90) and 0.94
(0.90 to 0.97), respectively.

Discussion
Overall occurrence of cancer in veterans who took part in tests at Porton Down was
similar to that of other veterans and lower than in the general population. These
findings are in accord with their cancer mortality.4 We also found no evidence of an excess of any specific, clearly
defined, cancer type or site in all Porton Down veterans combined. As expected, the
similarity to our findings for mortality was particularly notable for highly fatal
cancers such as those of the trachea, bronchus, and lung: the 9% higher rates of
lung cancer morbidity in Porton Down veterans is identical to the excess reported
for mortality.4 In the current study, we
were particularly interested in cancers with a relatively good survival. There was
no evidence to suggest rates of one of the commonest of these—malignant skin cancers
other than melanoma—were higher in Porton Down veterans, even after we reclassified
neoplasms previously coded as in situ or of uncertain or unknown behaviour. Porton
Down veterans did, however, experience increased rates of ill defined, secondary or
unspecified malignant neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or
unknown behaviour. Such findings are difficult to interpret in the absence of
information on smoking habits and other risk factors for cancer.

We identified almost 500 different chemicals in the records at Porton Down for
1941-89.3 We focused on nine specific
chemicals to which the largest numbers of veterans were exposed. Given the large
number of outcomes and exposure groups, some of the associations found might be due
to chance. Of the nine chemicals, sulphur mustard and benzene are known human
carcinogens, while nitrogen mustard is a probable carcinogen.6 Of these, the chemical most often used in tests was sulphur
mustard, a carcinogen known to affect the upper and lower respiratory tract. Over
half of Porton Down veterans were included in tests involving this chemical but they
experienced no increased cancer morbidity, either overall or for any specific
cancer. This probably reflects the low cumulative exposures received, especially
compared with those of manufacturing workers in whom excesses of upper and lower
respiratory cancer have been reported.9
10 In addition, use of physical protective
barriers (such as masks and clothing), which were recorded as used in over 30% of
tests involving vesicants,3 will have
reduced the actual exposure of veterans to these chemicals.

Despite it being a known human carcinogen, there was no evidence of an overall excess
of cancer in veterans exposed to benzene. Previous epidemiological evidence
indicates an association between occupational exposure to benzene and
leukaemia.6 Although the rate ratio for
leukaemia was above unity, the confidence interval was wide and the rate ratio did
not increase when we restricted analysis to veterans with two or more tests. The
increased strength of association with skin cancer other than melanoma in veterans
recorded to have high exposure to nitrogen mustard is noteworthy, given previous
evidence that this chemical is a human carcinogen.6 This needs to be qualified, however, by the absence of an increase in
those in whom the biological effect was high.

Although arsenic and arsenic compounds are human carcinogens,6 and Lewisite is an organic arsenic compound, there have been
no previous epidemiological studies of the carcinogenicity of this specific
chemical.11 While there was no evidence
of an overall excess of cancer in Porton Down veterans exposed to Lewisite, there
was an excess of lung cancer, which was also present in our previous mortality
analyses.4 The lack of association with
increasing exposure or effect levels for this chemical, together with the lack of
data on a known key confounding factor (smoking), make it difficult to attribute
this excess to tests at Porton Down and it might be a chance finding.

For the other chemicals examined, there were no clear associations between any
specific defined cancer type or site with sarin, pralidoxime, or atropine. For CS,
while the overall cancer occurrence was lower than in non-Porton Down veterans, it
was raised for cancer of the oesophagus, particularly in those who had two or more
tests. A similar excess was seen in veterans exposed to CR, the other lachrymator
included in our analyses.

In summary, the overall rates of cancer morbidity in Porton Down veterans were not
raised relative to other veterans or the general population. The excesses of ill
defined, secondary or unspecified malignant neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, and
neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behaviour were seen across several of the chemical
exposure groups analysed and are difficult to interpret.

What is already known on this topic
Many tests in the Porton Down research programme into chemical
warfare agents involved known carcinogens

What this study adds
Overall cancer morbidity was no higher in military personnel who had
been included in tests at Porton Down than in those who had not been
included or in the general population
