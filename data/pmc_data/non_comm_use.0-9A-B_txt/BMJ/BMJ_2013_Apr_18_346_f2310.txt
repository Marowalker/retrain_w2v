injections in addition to a standardised eccentric calf strengthening programme in
improving pain and function in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

Design Single centre, participant and single assessor blinded, parallel
group, randomised, controlled trial.

Setting Single sports medicine clinic in New Zealand.

Participants 53 adults (mean age 49, 53% men) with symptoms of unilateral
mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy for at least three months. Participants were excluded if
they had a history of previous Achilles tendon rupture or surgery or had undergone
previous adjuvant treatments such as injectable therapies, glyceryl trinitrate patches, or
extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

Interventions All participants underwent two unguided peritendinous
injections one month apart with a standardised protocol. The treatment group had 3 mL of
their own whole blood injected while the control group had no substance injected (needling
only). Participants in both groups carried out a standardised and monitored 12 week
eccentric calf training programme. Follow-up was at one, two, three and six months.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure was the change in symptoms
and function from baseline to six months with the Victorian Institute of Sport
Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score. Secondary outcomes were the participant’s perceived
rehabilitation and their ability to return to sport.

Results 26 participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 27
to the control group. In total, 50 (94%) completed the six month study, with 25 in each
group. Clear and clinically worthwhile improvements in the VISA-A score were evident at
six months in both the treatment (change in score 18.7, 95% confidence interval 12.3 to
25.1) and control (19.9, 13.6 to 26.2) groups. The overall effect of treatment was not
significant (P=0.689) and the 95% confidence intervals at all points precluded clinically
meaningful benefit or harm. There was no significant difference between groups in
secondary outcomes or in the levels of compliance with the eccentric calf strengthening
programme. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusion The administration of two unguided peritendinous autologous blood
injections one month apart, in addition to a standardised eccentric training programme,
provides no additional benefit in the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

==== Body
Introduction
Achilles tendinopathy causes chronic localised pain and stiffness. It affects over half of
middle distance
runners1 and is responsible for up to 16% of affected people
having to stop participating in their
sport.2 It is also a problem among non-athletes, with 31% of
cases occurring in sedentary
individuals.3 The mid-portion is the most commonly affected part of
the tendon. It is now recognised that the histopathological changes of tendinopathy are
consistent with mucoid degeneration and poor tissue healing, rather than
inflammation.4
5
6 Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been
proposed, but the aetiology of this condition remains
unclear.4
5
7 Recent studies indicate that a person’s genetic makeup
might predispose them to Achilles
tendinopathy.8
9
10

Numerous different methods have been proposed to treat tendinopathy, such as eccentric
training, the injection of corticosteroids and sclerosants, prolotherapy, extracorporeal
shockwave therapy, and glyceryl trinitrate
patches.11
12
13 Unfortunately, few of these treatments have shown
consistent effectiveness and the evidence for most treatment options is sparse. The lack of
prospective or randomised studies comparing treatment options makes evaluating their
effectiveness difficult. Currently, eccentric training is the first choice of treatment of
most
practitioners,14 although the methodological quality of the studies
suggesting efficacy has recently been
questioned.15
16

Autologous blood injections involve the reinjection of a patient’s own whole blood and are
a relatively novel and increasingly popular option for the treatment of tendinopathy. The
proposed mechanism of action is that the cytokines and growth factors within the injected
blood help to stimulate tissue healing and production of type 1
collagen.17
18
19 A few recent papers have suggested that such
injections are a useful management option in the treatment of
tendinopathy,19
20
21
22
23 but only one study, which has limitations, examined
their use in the treatment of Achilles
tendinopathy.24 We investigated the efficacy of autologous blood
injections as a treatment option in addition to an eccentric training programme in improving
pain and function in those with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods
This study was a prospective, participant and single assessor blinded, two arm, randomised
controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation.

Participants
Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged over 18 and presenting with
their first episode of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Symptoms must have been present
for at least three months and the diagnosis had to be confirmed by diagnostic
ultrasonography. An experienced musculoskeletal radiologist carried out the ultrasound
scans (Philips iU22 machine with L17-5 linear array transducer 5-17 MHz; Bothell,
Washington, DC). The findings were graded as mild if the tendon displayed only fusiform
thickening, moderate if there were additional hypoechoic areas present, and severe if
neovessels were also present on Doppler scanning. We excluded patients with bilateral
Achilles tendon symptoms, alternative diagnoses such as insertional Achilles tendinopathy,
or previous Achilles tendon rupture or surgery or who had previously undergone adjuvant
therapies such as any kind of injection, glyceryl trinitrate patches, or extracorporeal
shockwave therapy. We did not exclude people who had undertaken some form of eccentric
training.

This study was conducted at a specialist multidisciplinary sports medicine clinic
(Wakefield Sportsmed, Wellington, New Zealand). Participants were recruited after letters
were sent to over 200 general practitioners, physiotherapists, osteopaths, and podiatrists
in the Wellington region, articles were published in a number of local newspapers and
websites, or direct referral. People who were interested in taking part gave written
informed consent and were evaluated with a standardised procedure to collect baseline data
including sociodemographic data and information on sports they participated in.
Participants were recruited between November 2010 and April 2011 and followed up for six
months.

Interventions
All participants received two unguided peritendinous injections at the site of maximal
tenderness as marked by the blinded assessor. The participants lay prone with a screen
over their legs to block any view of the intervention taking place. One of three
non-blinded sports physicians administered the injections at baseline and one month later.
All participants had 3 mL of their own blood taken from their antecubital fossa. A
standardised three pass injection technique through a single puncture site was used for
participants in both randomised groups. The needle was firstly inserted perpendicular to
the tendon, with a second pass aimed 20° superiorly in the plane of the tendon, and a
third pass aimed 20° inferiorly. In the treatment group, patients received the 3 mL of
blood injected during the three passes, with 1 mL injected during each pass. The control
group underwent dry needling with the same technique but no substance was injected. The
blood was not processed, and no local anaesthetic was used. After the injection, the
puncture site was dressed and all participants were supervised while they massaged the
area for five minutes followed by a five minute walk.

All participants were instructed to rest from physical activity until any discomfort from
the injection had settled down. They were given written, pictorial, and verbal
instructions about how to carry out the standardised eccentric training
programme.25 This programme required each participant to do 180
eccentric heel drops over a step each day for a minimum of 12 weeks on the injured leg
only. Participants were allowed to exercise during this time as long as it did not induce
pain rated more than 4 on a 10 point scale.

Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles
(VISA-A) score measured at baseline and again at one, two, three, and six
months.2 The VISA-A score is a validated measure of pain and
function in those with Achilles tendinopathy. Scores range from 0-100, with 100 indicating
a symptom free tendon. Each participant completed the questionnaire under supervision from
the blinded assessor. Our primary outcome was the difference in the change in VISA-A score
from baseline between the groups.

Secondary outcomes included a six point Likert score at final follow-up to assess
perceived rehabilitation. All participants were asked to rate their level of return to
sport at the time of final follow-up. All participants completed daily eccentric training
compliance logs recording the number of repetitions and the amount of any additional
weight carried.

Sample size
The final sample size was estimated with a continuous variables method for studies
comparing two group means, with a type I error rate (α) of 0.05 and power of 0.80
(β=0.20).26 While consensus in the literature has not yet been
reached as to the minimally clinically important change in VISA-A
score,27 we settled on a change score of 10 based on the
primary criteria that this effect size would represent a noticeable functional difference
in the participant’s ability to participate in sport (questions 7 and 8 of the VISA-A
questionnaire). We used an SD of 17, drawn from a VISA-A reliability study, which resulted
in an estimated sample size of 24 per
group.2 The allowance of a 10% loss to follow-up brought the
estimate to 26 per group. During the peer review process, we noted an error in the sample
size calculation as the SD used reflected an overall VISA-A score rather than a change in
score over time. Subsequent estimates resulted in a sample size per group ranging from 11
to 18, suggesting the study was adequately powered to support the conclusions drawn.

Randomisation
Equal numbers of opaque envelopes containing treatment group and control group were
shuffled and kept together in a box. Each participant underwent simple randomisation into
one of the two groups by selecting a sealed envelope from the box. The participant’s name
and enrolment number were written on the envelope. After all baseline assessments were
completed, the non-blinded doctor carrying out the intervention opened the envelope to see
the group allocation. Allocation remained concealed from both the participant and the
assessor, who remained blinded throughout the study. At final follow-up all participants
completed a blinding analysis questionnaire to determine if blinding had been
compromised.

Statistical analysis
Analysis was carried out with statistical software (SPSS version 19.0, 2010, SPSS
Science, Chicago, IL). The interaction between treatment and time was treated in a linear
model with repeated measures to examine the effect of eccentric exercise and autologous
blood injection on change in the VISA-A scores over six months’ follow up and to provide
the point estimates and uncertainty (95% confidence intervals) relative to baseline. We
also evaluated the effect of adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, level of physical
activity, duration of symptoms, severity on ultrasonography, compliance with eccentric
training, additional weight carried during eccentric training, and eccentric exercise
technique on the magnitude of the effect of treatment on the change in VISA-A score. The
secondary outcomes—participant’s ability to return to sport and perceived degree of
rehabilitation—were analysed with one way analysis of variance. We used intention to treat
analysis via last observation carried forward for the three participants lost to
follow-up, with their final recorded outcome being brought forward for the remaining
missed data points.

Results
Recruitment
Of 88 people considered for recruitment, 53 (95% participation rate) met the inclusion
criteria and chose to enrol in the study. Of these, 50 (94%) completed all follow-up.

Primary outcomes
The treatment group’s mean VISA-A score improved from 58.1 at baseline to 76.8 at six
months; an overall change of 18.7 (95% confidence interval 12.3 to 25.1). The control
group improved from 57.3 to 77.2; an overall change of 19.9 (13.6 to 26.2). Figure

table
2 shows the estimates and uncertainty of the mean change in
scores over time. Clinically worthwhile improvements in mean VISA-A score were evident by
six months in both groups (table 2). The overall effect of treatment, however, was not
significant (P=0.689) and the 95% uncertainty at all points precluded clinically
meaningful benefit or harm. Adjustment for the effect of each of the covariates had no
impact on the final outcome relative to the unadjusted effect. Sensitivity analyses of the
impact of the last observation carried forward on the primary outcome, both with and
without imputation of missing data, did not alter our conclusions.

Mean compliance with eccentric repetition was similar in the treatment and control
groups, 65% (SD 17%) and 62% (SD 24%), respectively (P=0.612). Similarly, the mean amount
of weight added to a backpack worn while carrying out the eccentric training was no
different between the groups (P=0.591), with 8.8 kg (SD 9.8) and 10.5 kg (SD 12.1) being
carried in the treatment and control groups.

Of the 50 participants who completed follow-up, 49 answered the question “Which group do
you think you were allotted to?” before the unblinding of their group allocation. The one
participant who did not answer this question had inadvertently overlooked it. There was no
significant difference between the predictions of those in each of the groups (P=0.564),
with over half of the participants in each group answering that they were unsure into
which group they had been randomised.

Adverse events
There were no complications or adverse events as a result of the injections carried out
during the study.

Discussion
Summary of principal findings
To our knowledge, this is the first double blinded, randomised, controlled trial
investigating the efficacy of autologous blood injections as a treatment for mid-portion
Achilles tendinopathy in addition to a standardised eccentric training programme. Both
groups showed a steady and clinically meaningful improvement in the mean VISA-A scores
throughout the study. The addition of two peritendinous autologous blood injections
administered one month apart, however, was unlikely to have resulted in additional
clinically meaningful improvements in pain or in ability to return to activity.

Comparisons with the literature
The only other available published study investigating the use of autologous blood
injections to treat Achilles tendinopathy concluded that injections produced a moderate
improvement in
symptoms.24 This previous study lacked blinding and allocation
concealment, administered a variable number of injections, included participants with
unilateral and bilateral symptoms, and had a high dropout rate. The sample size recruited
for our study was large enough to preclude possible clinical benefits and harm and was
also similar to that in other randomised trials that used the change in VISA-A score as
the primary outcome measure (40-75
participants).24
28
29 The monitoring of eccentric training was also
similar to that used by some other
investigators,28
30 though others did not mention steps taken to
monitor
compliance.29
31 Good compliance probably contributes to a
participant’s clinical
improvement.25 Without accurate monitoring, any benefit
attributable to the intervention might actually be caused by disparity between groups in
the compliance with eccentric training or would at least increase the variation of the
results. It is also likely that there would be increased variation in measurement between
participants.

Explanations and clinical implications
The use of autologous blood injections to treat tendinopathy has become particularly
popular in recent years, despite the apparent lack of quality evidence supporting their
use.19
20
24
32
33 Our findings suggest that the application of
autologous blood injections as described has no clear clinically beneficial effect, and
based on this finding we cannot recommend their future use. There are, however, several
other possible explanations for the outcome. Firstly, the needling process itself might
have created sufficient bleeding in the control participants to induce a healing response.
Secondly, administering injections closer together would have enhanced any potential
benefit from maintaining a steady state effect of growth factors present in the
blood.17
19 The lack of ultrasound guidance, or the injections
being directed peritendinously rather than intratendinously, could have affected the
outcome. From our experience however, most autologous blood injections administered in New
Zealand are delivered peritendinously. Several reports of benefit from unguided injections
in tendinopathy support this type of
administration.24
32
33
34
35
36 There are also numerous studies indicating that
peritendinous injections of differing substances can provide benefit in the treatment of
Achilles
tendinopathy.24
36
37
38 The intratendinous injection of platelet rich
plasma, a derivative of whole blood, has been investigated in the treatment of mid-portion
Achilles tendinopathy with mixed results to
date.39 The proposed mechanism of action of autologous
blood injections and platelet rich plasma is similar, but the former is cheaper as it does
not require specific preparation and a smaller volume of blood is taken from participants.
The negligible clinical effect of autologous blood injections in this study, and the mixed
results of platelet rich plasma, suggest that these forms of injection therapy are not
useful for the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Eccentric training is
already recognised as a good treatment option for Achilles
tendinopathy,15
25
28 and both groups showed a clinical improvement as a
result of the eccentric training component. It was therefore difficult to show an additive
clinically meaningful effect of autologous blood injections. We did not use any type of
substance in the injections in the control group, whereas most other studies used
injections of normal
saline28
40
41
42 or local
anaesthetic.43
44 There is recent evidence to suggest that higher
levels of extracellular sodium suppress transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) activity,
a non-selective cation channel present in nociceptors that helps to integrate pain
perception.45 We considered that injecting normal saline could
itself result in reduced pain sensation, and as such, not strictly act as a control
intervention. Indeed, the group allocation prediction analysis shows that participants
were unable to determine which group that they had been randomised to, suggesting that
with the use of our control intervention, we were able to maintain adequate blinding.

Strengths and limitations of the study
Strengths of this study were the high participation rate (95%) and low dropout rate (6%).
The participants reflected a wide range of society with ages ranging from 27 to 76 and sex
being evenly matched with 53% men and 47% women. There was, however, an
under-representation of minority ethnic groups, with 91% of the participants identifying
themselves as European and the 9% remaining as New Zealand Maori. A further strength was
the use of the validated primary outcome measure, the VISA-A questionnaire, which was
completed in the presence of the single blinded assessor. We also used daily monitoring of
eccentric training compliance with a written log, which could have encouraged good
compliance and showed that there were no differences between the groups in the eccentric
training aspect of the management.

Future research
We conclude that the administration of unguided peritendinous autologous blood injections
does not confer an additional benefit to rehabilitation outcomes resulting from a
standardised eccentric training programme. Follow-up studies could involve the injections
being given intratendinously under ultrasound guidance, a shorter time interval between
injections, or an increase in the volume of injected blood. It would also be beneficial to
have a third treatment group who undertake an eccentric training programme only, without
injection. While such derivations would aid in estimation of the effect of the needling
itself, it would be without blinding and therefore susceptible to placebo effects. A
fourth treatment with autologous blood injections in the absence of eccentric training
would help to determine whether any benefit is obtained from injections in isolation.

What is already know on this topic
Several studies have suggested that the injection of autologous blood can be
helpful in the treatment of various tendinopathies

Autologous blood injections are a relatively common treatment, despite a lack of
high quality evidence supporting their use in the management of Achilles
tendinopathy

What this study adds
The use of peritendinous autologous blood injections does not reduce pain or
improve function in those with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy when they are
combined with an eccentric training programme
