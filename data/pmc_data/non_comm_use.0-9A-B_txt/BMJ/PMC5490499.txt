==== Body
The last sentence of the introduction in this article by Paolo Zaninotto and colleagues (BMJ 2016; 355 doi:10.1136/bmj.i6267) wrongly stated that the paper included behavioural confounders. In addition, it incorrectly listed baseline recording of current smoking, vigorous or moderate activity at least once per week, and drinking alcohol at least daily at the end of the second paragraph of the Measures section.
