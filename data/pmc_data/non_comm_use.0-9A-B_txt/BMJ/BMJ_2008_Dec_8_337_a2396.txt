Objective To compare the effectiveness of an algorithm for diagnosis
                    of active labour in primiparous women with standard care in terms of maternal
                    and neonatal outcomes.

Design Cluster randomised trial.

Setting Maternity units in Scotland with at least 800 annual births.

Participants 4503 women giving birth for the first time, in 14
                    maternity units. Seven experimental clusters collected data from a baseline
                    sample of 1029 women and a post-implementation sample of 896 women. The seven
                    control clusters had a baseline sample of 1291 women and a post-implementation
                    sample of 1287 women.

Intervention Use of an algorithm by midwives to assist their
                    diagnosis of active labour, compared with standard care.

Main outcomes Primary outcome: use of oxytocin for augmentation of
                    labour. Secondary outcomes: medical interventions in labour, admission
                    management, and birth outcome.

Results No significant difference was found between groups in
                    percentage use of oxytocin for augmentation of labour (experimental minus
                    control, difference=0.3, 95% confidence interval −9.2 to 9.8; P=0.9) or in the
                    use of medical interventions in labour. Women in the algorithm group were more
                    likely to be discharged from the labour suite after their first labour
                    assessment (difference=−19.2, −29.9 to −8.6; P=0.002) and to have more
                    pre-labour admissions (0.29, 0.04 to 0.55; P=0.03).

Conclusions Use of an algorithm to assist midwives with the
                    diagnosis of active labour in primiparous women did not result in a reduction in
                    oxytocin use or in medical intervention in spontaneous labour. Significantly
                    more women in the experimental group were discharged home after their first
                    labour ward assessment.

Introduction
Women are often uncertain about the onset of labour and timing their hospital
                    admission,1
                2
                3
                4 and this uncertainty may also extend to
                midwives and obstetricians. Although superficially straightforward, diagnosis of
                labour has been described as one of the most difficult and important judgments in
                the care of a woman in labour.5 Evidence
                shows that misjudgments are often made: between 30% and 45% of women admitted to
                labour wards in the United Kingdom and other developed countries are subsequently
                found not to be in labour.6
                7
                8 These admissions may have important
                clinical consequences. Several studies have shown that women admitted in the latent
                phase or not yet in labour are more likely to receive medical intervention
                (electronic monitoring, epidural analgesia, oxytocin, and caesarean section) than
                those admitted in active labour.8
                9
                10
                11 The widespread use of routine medical
                intervention in labour is of worldwide concern.12
                13
                14
                15 Caesarean section rates as high as 80%
                have been reported among some groups.16 In
                England, only 46% of women experience normal birth—that is, birth without surgical
                intervention, use of instruments, induction, augmentation with oxytocin, epidural,
                or general anaesthetic.17 Interventions in
                labour have been associated with increased levels of morbidity and mortality for
                mothers and babies,18
                19
                20
                21 and reduction in the overall rate of
                intervention in labour is an international healthcare target.22
                23

A possible reason for the higher rate of intervention in women admitted early is that
                clinicians do not make an accurate distinction between women who are in active
                labour and those who are not yet in labour or who are in the latent phase.8
                9
                10
                11 This may be because they misdiagnose
                active labour or because they use labour ward admission itself as a proxy measure
                for active labour. Once admitted, the mere presence of a woman in the labour ward
                over a protracted period of time may encourage caregivers to intervene.24 Supporting clinicians’ judgments about
                diagnosis of labour by providing explicit diagnostic cues has the potential to
                reduce unnecessary admissions to the labour ward and correspondingly the rate of
                intervention in labour.

Although diagnostic cues for labour have been described,7
                25
                26
                27
                28
                29
                30
                31 only one randomised controlled trial has
                tested the efficacy of adhering to strict criteria for diagnosis of labour.30 This study reported a reduction in the use
                of augmentation with oxytocin and analgesics. The study was small, however, and a
                Cochrane review concluded that a multicentre randomised controlled trial was needed
                to determine the risks and benefits of using explicit criteria to diagnose active
                    labour.5

The Medical Research Council suggests a framework for developing and evaluating
                randomised controlled trials for complex healthcare interventions.32 We followed this framework in conducting a
                series of studies to explore the diagnosis of labour from the perspective of
                midwives and women and a needs assessment for an intervention to support midwives’
                diagnosis of labour.4
                33
                34 We chose midwives because they are the
                professional group responsible for the admission of healthy women in labour in the
                UK. We chose a decision support approach because evidence shows that decision aided
                judgments consistently outperform clinical judgment alone.35
                36 Furthermore, the MRC framework stresses
                the importance of defining the trial intervention, and this is particularly
                important in a trial involving multiple sites. We therefore chose to structure the
                diagnostic cues for labour in the form of an algorithm, thus ensuring (as far as
                possible) that the intervention would be applied in a standard fashion across trial
                sites.

We hypothesised that improving the diagnosis of labour in primiparous women through
                the use of an algorithm would result in a reduction in the use of oxytocin for
                augmentation of labour and other labour interventions compared with standard care.
                We chose a cluster randomised trial for this purpose because the algorithm was aimed
                at the clinical practice of midwives. We could not use individual randomisation of
                women or midwives because of the risk of contamination between groups. The results
                of a health economics evaluation, done as part of the cluster randomised trial, will
                be presented elsewhere.

Methods
Recruitment and randomisation
The trial took place between April 2005 and June 2007. Three levels of
                    participation existed: the unit of randomisation was the maternity unit,
                    midwives were participants at the level of the intervention, and we measured
                    trial outcomes for women receiving maternity care.

Maternity units in Scotland with at least 800 annual births were eligible to
                    participate in the trial. These units had the facilities to provide oxytocin for
                    augmentation of labour.37 After
                    discussion with heads of midwifery and other stakeholders at each unit, clinical
                    directors gave consent for trial entry. Thereafter, we used minimisation to
                    allocate maternity units to experimental or control groups.38 After random allocation of the first maternity unit,
                    we purposively allocated clusters in order to maximise balance between groups.
                    We chose presence or absence of an on-site midwife managed birth unit as the
                    balancing variable, because the philosophy of care within a midwife managed
                    birth unit would be one of low medical intervention and this could correlate
                    with a lower use of oxytocin. JMB did the group allocation and was not involved
                    in recruitment. Study implementation was staged to allow time for training of
                    midwives, with a data collection period of up to 10 months in each maternity
                    unit. A clinical midwife in each unit was responsible for facilitating study
                    implementation and collecting trial outcome data from case records.

In the experimental group, we invited midwives who admitted women in labour to
                    participate in the study. We provided workshops and individual contacts for each
                    midwife, and each received a training manual. This included information on how
                    to use the algorithm, the cluster trial method, completion of study
                    documentation, and seeking consent from women in labour. Thereafter, we asked
                    midwives to consent to study participation. We made minimum contact with
                    midwives in control units to reduce the potential for a Hawthorne effect.39

We considered women to be eligible for recruitment if they attended a
                    participating maternity unit for assessment of labour and were primiparous, at
                    term, and assessed as low risk on the basis of criteria used in previous
                    intrapartum studies (box).40
                    41
                    42 We used the same eligibility
                    criteria in both experimental and control groups. In order to reduce confounding
                    variables, we excluded multiparous women from the trial. Although the principles
                    of diagnosis of labour are the same for both primiparous and multiparous women,
                    differences exist in the way in which their labour would be expected to
                    progress. Furthermore, a woman’s previous experience of labour will influence
                    her intrapartum care.

Women in both arms of the trial were given information at a clinic visit between
                    34 and 36 weeks’ gestation. Women were required to give consent for use of the
                    algorithm and collection of identifying data (needed for distribution of the
                    health economics questionnaire). However, because the trial intervention was the
                    assessment of labour on admission, consent had to be obtained differently in
                    experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, the admitting
                    midwife identified eligible women on admission to the labour suite and provided
                    written and verbal explanations of the study and asked for consent. This
                    approach could not be used in control groups without involving labour ward
                    midwives in providing information about the trial and thus contaminating the
                    group, so women in the control group were asked for consent in the postnatal
                    wards. We asked midwives to recruit women who would have been eligible for the
                    trial when they first presented for labour admission, regardless of subsequent
                    labour outcome. Although blinding of midwives was not possible, only midwives in
                    the experimental group had access to the algorithm and minimum information about
                    the study was available to control units.

Intervention
The process of development and pre-testing of the algorithm is described
                        elsewhere.33
                    34
                    43 The algorithm comprised three
                    levels: level one confirmed the woman’s eligibility for involvement in the study
                    (that is, a healthy primiparous woman with a normal, term pregnancy); level two
                    prompted a general physical assessment (for example, temperature, pulse, and
                    blood pressure); and level three presented, in a stepwise fashion, key
                    informational cues needed for diagnosis of labour. Active labour was diagnosed
                    when painful, regular, moderate or strong uterine contractions were present (on
                    the basis of the midwives’ clinical assessments), as well as at least one of the
                    following cues: cervix effacing and at least 3 cm dilated, spontaneous rupture
                    of membranes, or “show.” We rigorously pre-tested the algorithm with three
                    samples of midwives by using questionnaires and vignettes and found it to have
                    good face validity and content validity and a high level of inter-rater
                        reliability.43 Subsequently, we did
                    a feasibility study in two maternity units. This showed that the implementation
                    strategy and methods for the cluster randomised trial were feasible and
                    acceptable to midwives and women.34
                    Midwives reported that the algorithm was acceptable and potentially useful,
                    particularly for inexperienced midwives.

Context
All units that participated in the trial were consultant led maternity units with
                    a range of neonatal facilities (table 1), as
                    classified by the report of the expert group on acute maternity services in
                        Scotland.37 The predominant model
                    of care in all of these units encouraged women to contact their maternity unit,
                    by telephone, for advice when they thought that they were in labour and then to
                    attend the maternity unit for admission assessment. In all of the units the
                    labour assessment for most women was done in either the labour ward or a
                    designated assessment area. During the trial, women in both groups contacted the
                    hospital and then attended for assessment in a similar way.

†Recruitment seems to exceed total number of midwives in one cluster
                            because team model of midwifery care was operating in that unit; this
                            meant that most hospital and community based midwives had labour suite
                            commitment during study period.

Trial groups
Experimental—In the experimental group, we asked midwives to use
                    the algorithm during the admission assessment of women to assist in the
                    diagnosis of active labour, recording their judgment on the algorithm. The
                    algorithm was printed on duplicate paper; once completed, one part was retained
                    in the woman’s case record and the other was collected by the local study
                    coordinator. Women identified as not yet in active labour were encouraged to
                    return home or were admitted to an antenatal area, depending on local maternity
                    unit policy.

Control—Eligible women who attended for admission assessment in
                    the control group units received normal care. This comprised admission
                    assessment by midwives using clinical judgment alone. Although standard care
                    varied between control units, none had guidelines or protocols for diagnosis of
                    labour at the time of this study. Owing to the Scotland-wide, multisite nature
                    of the trial, dictating where the woman should go after the admission assessment
                    was not appropriate. Some units served remote and rural areas, in which women
                    may have travelled for several hours to reach the maternity unit. In such cases,
                    women may have had difficulty returning home. Therefore, after the admission
                    assessment, women in both groups received standard care for their maternity
                    unit.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was use of oxytocin (any dose) for augmentation of labour.
                    Women who are admitted during the latent phase of labour are more likely to be
                    diagnosed as having slow progress in labour.8
                    9
                    10
                    11 We chose oxytocin as the primary
                    outcome because it is the principal treatment (and key marker) of slow progress
                    in labour. Furthermore, primiparous women who receive oxytocin have a reduced
                    likelihood of an unassisted vaginal delivery.44 The use of explicit criteria for admission in labour has been
                    associated with a significant reduction in use of oxytocin in labour.5 Secondary outcomes were interventions in
                    labour (artificial rupture of membranes, vaginal examination, continuous
                    electronic fetal monitoring, and use of analgesia), admission management (number
                    of admissions before labour, time spent in labour ward, and duration of active
                    labour), and labour outcomes (mode of delivery, intrapartum complications,
                    neonatal outcome, and unplanned out of hospital births).

Data collection
We collected study outcome data from a sample of case records at baseline and a
                    second sample after implementation of the study. We collected baseline data
                    retrospectively from the case records of 200 women who gave birth in each unit
                    before implementation of the study and who fitted the trial eligibility criteria
                    on first labour ward assessment. These data were anonymised. We collected data
                    for the post-implementation sample from case records after delivery.

A secretary based in the research unit entered all data and monitored returns to
                    ensure that recruitment was meeting agreed milestones. We audited data forms
                    (10%) and found 88% accuracy of data entry; 12% of cases had one data entry
                    error, which was corrected. We established an independent data and safety
                    monitoring committee to monitor the occurrence of severe adverse incidents
                    relating to the study. No such incidents occurred.

Sample size
The statistical power calculation was appropriate for an unmatched cluster
                    randomised design. The feasibility study showed the rate of oxytocin use in
                    primiparous women in spontaneous labour to be more than 40% in several units in
                    Scotland, with a mean of 34%. We calculated the intracluster correlation
                    coefficient to be 0.041. The multidisciplinary trial steering group deemed a
                    difference of 10 percentage points (for example, from 40% to 30%) in the
                    proportion of women receiving oxytocin to be clinically relevant. Because only a
                    maximum of 15 maternity units were available, simply comparing intervention and
                    control groups could not achieve sufficient power to detect this difference. We
                    therefore used baseline data for the maternity unit to reduce the effect of
                    variation between units. We noted the proportion of women given oxytocin before
                    and after study implementation and used the proportion before implementation as
                    a covariate in an analysis at the level of the maternity unit. From the
                    feasibility study data the study statistician (JMB) estimated that the
                    correlation between proportions would be 0.89, by using data for 200 women
                    before and 200 after implementation of the study in each unit. We used these
                    estimates in the Stata 8 sampsi command to estimate a study power of 0.97 for
                    detecting a 10 percentage point difference in oxytocin use at a significance
                    level of 0.05 “after” oxytocin use, with a total of at least 12 hospitals with
                    200 women observed before and 200 after the trial implementation point.

Analysis
Data analysis was appropriate for a cluster randomised trial and accounted for
                    clustering of observations within maternity units. In practice, a woman may
                    receive care from several midwives, so we did all analysis at the level of the
                    unit or the woman. The primary analysis used multiple regression of maternity
                    unit level data adjusted for baseline. This meant that for each outcome we
                    calculated a summary statistic (the mean or proportion) for each cluster, at
                    baseline and after study implementation. In each case, the baseline value was
                    the covariate. This provided a confidence interval and test of significance for
                    the difference in proportions of women receiving oxytocin. We did other analyses
                    at the level of the individual woman or using data aggregated to cluster level
                    as appropriate.

Results
Of the 16 eligible maternity units in Scotland, one had participated in the
                feasibility study. We approached the remaining 15 units, of which 14 agreed to
                participate and were allocated to experimental or control groups. One unit declined
                because of other research commitments (fig 1). Once
                entered, all units completed the trial as allocated. Table 1 gives a description of the units. Most units in both groups were
                classified as 11c on the basis of the classification of the expert group on acute
                maternity services in Scotland,37 and
                annual births ranged from 950 to 5242. Two units in each group had an on-site
                midwife managed birth unit. Overall, 80% of midwives consented to participate (unit
                range 57-100%). Baseline data were collected for 1029 women in the experimental
                group and 1291 women in the control group (fig 1).

Fig 1 Trial profile.

The steering group did a routine review of study procedures after the first few
                months of data collection and recommended a protocol change to minimise any
                potential risk of selection bias in the control group. Midwives might have been
                reluctant to approach women who had experienced complications of labour or negative
                outcomes. We asked midwives in the control group to continue to recruit women as
                planned up to a sample of 100 women, needed for the health economics evaluation
                questionnaire. We asked them to then go back to the recruitment start date and
                review the case records of women who had given birth from that time and who had been
                eligible but not recruited. Anonymous study outcome data were collected from
                consecutive cases up to the total target sample of 200 cases. This resulted in near
                complete data collection in control units. This strategy was not needed in
                experimental sites, where all women were recruited prospectively on admission to
                labour suites. The second sample, recruited after implementation of the study,
                comprised 896 women from experimental units and 1287 cases from the control units
                (these cases comprised women who consented postnatally and the anonymously collected
                data). A small amount of information was lost to follow-up from the
                post-implementation sample owing to inability to retrieve case records (four in the
                experimental group and eight in the control group) (fig 1). We thus analysed data for 892 women in the experimental group and
                1279 women in the control group.

Table 2 shows the flow of data by cluster. We
                estimated the number of potentially available women from routinely collected
                national data.45
                46 This gives the number of women who would
                have been potentially eligible for recruitment during the planned 10 month data
                collection period after implementation of the trial in each cluster. The Information
                Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland provides national data by health
                board area, so local variations in maternity activity are included. The smallest
                units (in terms of annual births) did not necessarily have the fewest number of
                women who were potentially eligible for the trial. We asked units to recruit 200
                women after implementation of the trial, but only nine units managed this. Although
                the data on potentially eligible women are estimates, they suggest that the smallest
                units experienced difficulty in recruiting the target sample within the trial
                period.

Table 3 shows cluster level data for the primary
                outcome. Figure 2 shows the proportion of women
                given oxytocin for augmentation of labour in each cluster at baseline and
                post-implementation. We found no significant difference in the percentage of
                oxytocin use attributable to the application of the algorithm (difference=0.3, 95%
                confidence interval −9.2 to 9.8; P=0.9).

For secondary outcomes, we present summary descriptive data for experimental and
                control groups at baseline (before) and post-intervention (after): these data do not
                take account of the effect of clustering. We then used regression to analyse data
                for each outcome, taking account of clustering. We adjusted the difference between
                groups (experimental minus control) for baseline and clustering. We found no
                significant difference between groups for any of the labour interventions
                considered: artificial rupture of membranes, continuous electronic fetal monitoring,
                use of pain relief, and vaginal examination (table 4).

Significantly more women in the control group had only one admission (table 5), meaning that women in the control group were
                more likely to remain in the labour suite after their first admission assessment
                until delivery. In contrast, women in the experimental group were significantly more
                likely to have several admissions and discharges before their eventual admission
                leading to delivery.

We found no significant difference between groups for duration of active labour, time
                from the first labour assessment to delivery, or time from final admission to labour
                suite until delivery (table 6). The mean duration
                of active labour exceeded the mean time from admission to delivery because active
                labour started before admission in several cases. Table 7 shows additional descriptive data on mean time from final admission
                to delivery and duration of active labour by the number of admissions before labour.
                We did no statistical analysis, as the number of previous admissions was an outcome
                variable.

We found no significant difference in mode of delivery between study groups (table
                    8). Overall, 45% (n=2028) of women had at
                least one intrapartum complication. We made statistical comparisons only for
                complications that occurred in at least 100 cases, as with fewer cases we could not
                allow for clustering. We found no significant difference in maternal complications
                between groups.

                babies were admitted to the neonatal unit for more than 48 hours, but this did not

                babies with an Apgar score less than 7 at five minutes occurred, so we did no
                statistical analysis for these variables. One stillbirth occurred in the control

Discussion
This trial, involving 14 maternity units and 4503 women, tested the effectiveness of
                an algorithm to assist midwives with the diagnosis of active labour in primiparous
                women. We found that use of the algorithm did not reduce the number of women who
                received oxytocin or other medical interventions compared with standard care.
                Significantly more women in the control group remained in the labour ward until
                delivery after their first admission, whereas women in the experimental group were
                more likely to be discharged home and subsequently have significantly more
                admissions before labour. We found no significant difference between groups in the
                length of time from the first labour ward assessment until delivery, time spent in
                the labour suite during labour, or duration of active labour. No significant
                difference existed between groups for maternal or neonatal complications or
                unplanned out of hospital births.

Although we found no significant difference in the primary outcome, the strength of
                the study design means that it makes an important contribution to the debate on
                early labour management. The diagnosis of labour has important clinical and resource
                implications for the care of a woman in labour, but only one other trial has
                specifically evaluated the efficacy of using strict diagnostic criteria.30 In contrast to our findings, this trial
                reported that when labour was assessed by using strict diagnostic criteria
                significantly fewer women received oxytocin to augment labour (22.9%
                v 40.4%) compared with no labour assessment and less pain relief
                was used (7.6% v 20%). Although both trials included similar
                diagnostic criteria, the interventions were not identical. In the study by McNiven
                et al, low risk women were randomly allocated when they presented in spontaneous
                    labour.30 All women in the control
                group were admitted directly to the labour ward without assessment of labour,
                whereas women in the experimental group had their labour assessed with strict
                criteria; those judged not to be in labour were sent home or remained in an
                assessment area to await the establishment of active labour before being admitted to
                the labour ward. McNiven et al thus evaluated a package of care that included both
                diagnosis and management of early labour.30
                In the trial reported here, midwives in both experimental and control groups carried
                out a clinical assessment of women before admission to the labour suite. In the
                experimental group this assessment was supported by the algorithm. In both groups,
                decisions about subsequent clinical management were determined by the midwives
                (women could be admitted or discharged home). Therefore, the groups differed only in
                the use of the algorithm; this may have contributed to the difference in findings
                compared with those of McNiven et al.30 The
                principal difference between the studies is, however, in design and scale. McNiven
                et al’s study took place in one hospital with 209 women and was underpowered to test
                the effects of the intervention on several important maternal and neonatal
                    outcomes.30 As our study included 14
                maternity units and data on 4503 women, the results are more likely to be an
                accurate estimate of the effect of using explicit diagnostic cues for active labour
                on the rate of oxytocin use.

This highlights the importance of both study power and design. Although the target
                recruitment of 12 maternity units with an overall target sample of 400 in each unit
                (200 before and 200 after implementation of the trial) was not achieved at all
                sites, this deficit was partially offset by the recruitment of an additional two
                maternity units. The use of baseline data to reduce the in-hospital variation was a
                methodological development in this trial. The correlation between the percentage of
                women receiving oxytocin before and after the intervention was 0.46, which was less
                than the 0.89 originally estimated from data collected during the feasibility study
                and this reduced the power of the study (changes within the units may have occurred
                over time and reduced the correlation). Nevertheless, reflecting with hindsight on
                the success of this method we can conclude that the study had sufficient power to
                test the primary outcome; the 95% confidence interval for the difference in
                percentage use of oxytocin was −9.2 to 9.8, which excludes the difference of 10
                percentage points we had chosen as the difference that would be of clinical
                relevance.

The fact that this is the first adequately powered study to assess the impact of
                diagnostic cues in early labour management is in itself a success. Healthcare
                professionals need robust evidence on which to draw in making decisions about
                clinical care. Studies of complex interventions that are then tested in complex care
                systems are challenging, particularly when a multi-site trial is needed. We followed
                the MRC framework for the development of randomised controlled trials of complex
                healthcare interventions, doing a series of pilot and feasibility studies before the
                cluster trial reported here. However, the science of trial development for complex
                interventions is constantly changing; since the inception of this trial, the
                importance of carrying out process evaluations concurrently within the trial itself
                (rather than in the development stages of the trial as in this study) has been
                    recognised.47 Such an evaluation may
                have provided an explanation of the finding of no difference between groups for the
                primary outcome. It is a characteristic of complex systems (such as maternity units)
                that even a simple intervention may have unpredictable effects on the processes and
                outcomes of care.48 Therefore, the act of
                doing a process evaluation during the course of a trial may in itself alter
                practice, thus confounding the results of the study. These factors need careful
                consideration during the design stages of trials of complex interventions.

Limitations of the trial
We could not accurately determine the number of eligible women in each maternity
                    unit, and estimates were based on routinely collected data (table 2). These data were available by hospital, for
                    primiparous women at term, with a singleton pregnancy, in spontaneous labour,
                    and over 16 years. However, we could not identify the number of women who would
                    have been ineligible for medical or obstetric reasons, nor could we
                    differentiate between women who were not eligible and those who were not
                    approached for consent to data collection. During the feasibility study, 85% of
                    women approached gave consent, so women not included were probably not
                    approached. Although almost all eligible women in some of the smaller units
                    seemed to have been included, in most of the units the proportion of eligible
                    women not included was high and therefore selection bias could have occurred.
                    The strength of the cluster design is that it avoids contamination between
                    groups; however, the design is prone to selection bias,49 because consent to trial entry is given at cluster
                    level but individuals can then decide whether to accept or refuse the trial
                    intervention. Selection bias is also a common problem in trials of intrapartum
                    care, in which difficulty in estimating numbers of potentially eligible
                    participants and high losses to recruitment are often reported.50 Intrapartum trials often rely on
                    clinical staff to seek consent from women who are in labour. This method is
                    practical in recruiting women close to the point of study intervention, but
                    recruitment is vulnerable to practitioners both making clinical judgments about
                    which women to approach and forgetting about the trial in the midst of a busy
                    labour suite.

In the experimental group, midwives sought consent from women on admission to the
                    labour suite; this is clearly an emotional time at which to seek consent.
                    However, as this trial sought to include only women with a normal healthy
                    pregnancy, those women who were particularly vulnerable due to identifiable
                    medical or obstetric risk factors for mother or baby were excluded. Midwives may
                    have deemed it inappropriate to approach women who presented in advanced labour
                    (this has been reported in other intrapartum studies42). A systematic bias in the experimental group towards
                    recruiting women admitted in early labour would have resulted in a longer time
                    period between the first labour assessment and delivery in that group. However,
                    we found no significant difference between the groups in this respect, which
                    suggests that no systematic selection occurred in favour of women in early
                    labour in the experimental group.

Our aim was that the trial would have minimal impact in the control units, so no
                    member of staff was given access to the algorithm and no information about the
                    trial was introduced to labour suite midwives. Although we could not recruit
                    women in the control group in the same way as in the experimental group, we used
                    the same trial entry criteria. We maximised the use of anonymised data after the
                    protocol change, to minimise the potential for Hawthorne effects and reduce
                    selection bias.

The admission of women in labour is part of routine midwifery practice, and
                    midwives in both groups probably used the same or similar criteria for diagnosis
                    of labour (we developed the algorithm in consultation with midwives). However,
                    the structuring of these cues in a linear decision rule comprised the
                    intervention tested in this trial. Studies of decision support suggest that it
                    is the consistency of decision support tools, not the provision of new
                    knowledge, that makes them effective.51
                    52 However, the reluctance of
                    healthcare professionals to use decision support has been widely reported in
                    other studies.35
                    36
                    53
                    54 For example, a study of a decision
                    support tool that reduced the rate of false positive diagnosis of acute
                    ischaemic heart disease from 71% to 0% found that the subsequent use of the tool
                    by clinicians was only 2.8%.55 Several
                    possible reasons have been suggested—in particular, that decision support
                    mediates against individuality of care and that it undermines the skills of the
                        practitioner.56
                    57
                    58 Use of decision support tools has
                    also been suggested to undermine the clinical credibility of practitioners.
                    Arkes et al found that the diagnostic ability of doctors who used decision
                    support was rated (by students) as lower than that of those who used clinical
                    judgment alone.59 We assessed the
                    acceptability of the algorithm to midwives during the feasibility study, in
                    which midwives reported willingness to use the algorithm. In the cluster
                    randomised trial, the rate of consent of midwives to use the algorithm varied
                    between units from 57% to 100%. In most (although not all) units, this consent
                    rate reflected the success or otherwise of subsequent data collection. Although
                    an algorithm was completed for each woman, and this gives an indication of
                    compliance with the protocol, midwives could have disregarded its recommendation
                    in deciding whether to admit or discharge women. Studies of how nurses use
                    computerised decision support tools indicate that such tools are often completed
                    after the nurse has made a decision about the care that a patient should
                        receive,60
                    61
                    62
                    63 and this may have contributed to the
                    finding of no difference in the primary outcome. We found evidence that using
                    the algorithm did alter the midwives’ judgments, as women in the experimental
                    group were significantly more likely to be discharged after their first labour
                    assessment than were women in the control group. However, these women quickly
                    returned to the hospital, creating a “revolving door” effect. This implies that
                    the observation from other studies of higher rates of intervention in women
                    admitted to labour suites early cannot be fully explained by a failure of
                    clinicians to distinguish between the latent and active phases of labour.

Recommendations and future directions
Admission of women who are not in active labour is a considerable problem leading
                    to higher levels of medical intervention than for those admitted in active
                    labour. Maternity service guidelines advocate advising women to remain at home
                    or to return home until labour is established, but this may be an
                    over-simplistic approach that does not meet the needs of women in early labour.
                    We designed the algorithm to support one aspect of the process of the management
                    of early labour (the diagnosis). The fact that this has not translated into a
                    change in clinical outcomes probably reflects the complexity of management
                    decisions for women in labour, which are influenced by factors such as how a
                    woman is coping with pain and the level of social support available. Studies of
                    women’s experience of early labour have found that women in their first
                    pregnancy report feeling unprepared for the latent phase of labour and that
                    their experience is characterised by pain and anxiety.4
                    64 Women seek reassurance from hospital
                    admission; although some receive this reassurance, others report feeling that
                    their needs (in particular for pain relief) were not met. Our findings suggest
                    that although the algorithm has the potential to reduce admissions of women not
                    in active labour, merely sending these women home did not produce a clinical
                    benefit. Indeed, it may have contributed to negative experiences for these
                    women. Analysis of postnatal questionnaire data (which will be reported in a
                    separate paper), obtained by use of a discrete choice experiment method,
                    suggested that women had a positive preference for being admitted on initial
                    presentation, as opposed to being discharged home on two or three occasions.

Conclusions
Use of an algorithm for diagnosis of active labour in primiparous women did not
                    result in a reduction in oxytocin use or medical intervention in spontaneous
                    labour. More women in the experimental group were discharged home after their
                    first labour ward assessment. Diagnosis of labour is an important clinical
                    judgment. However, subsequent decisions made about the management of women found
                    to be not yet in labour, or who are in the latent phase, may be the most
                    important and difficult decisions in the care of a woman in labour. Research
                    that includes both women’s and clinicians’ perspectives about management of
                    early labour is now needed.

What is already known on this topic
Up to 30% of women admitted to labour wards in the UK may not be
                                    in active labour

Women admitted to labour wards in the latent phase of labour are
                                    more likely to receive medical intervention than are those
                                    admitted in active labour

Previous studies have indicated that the introduction of explicit
                                    criteria for diagnosis of labour may reduce oxytocin use

What this study adds
The introduction of an algorithm to assist with the diagnosis of
                                    labour did not reduce oxytocin use

Use of an algorithm for the diagnosis of labour increased the
                                    number of times women were admitted and subsequently discharged
                                    from hospital before finally being admitted for delivery

Increased rates of intervention in women admitted to labour
                                    suites early cannot be fully explained by failure of clinicians
                                    to distinguish between the latent and active phases of
                                labour
