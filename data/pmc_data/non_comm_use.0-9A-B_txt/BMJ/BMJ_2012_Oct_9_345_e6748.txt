Appleby highlights the pay gap between male and female doctors,1 a fact that a joint report from the BMA and the Medical Women’s Federation noted in 2009.2 More work is needed to determine why this gap persists and what measures are being put in place to turn it around.

The Medical Women’s Federation encourages female doctors to negotiate and to take an active part in their job planning process. Women need to engage actively in job planning and to ensure that they can bring to the appraisal table all that they do in their job. Inevitably, some female doctors who are mothers will seek to work flexibly for part of their career and therefore earn less. Nevertheless, when they go back to full time work there should be no pay disparity at junior doctor level. At consultant, specialty doctor, and GP level we encourage all female doctors to look hard at their working week and ensure that they are paid for the work they do. As a national nominating body for ACCEA (Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards), we encourage our consultant members to apply for these awards and provide the support and mentoring they need.

We would like more women to put themselves forward for senior positions in management, leadership, and teaching to get just rewards from their jobs and to earn what they deserve.
