In the online PDF of this article by Ingrid Toews and colleagues (BMJ 2019;364:k4718, doi:10.1136/bmj.k4718), the legend to figure 2 was labelled incorrectly and should have read: “PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) flowchart of included studies28.” The online PDF has since been corrected.
