The White House has announced that it is expanding public access to federally funded research.

In a policy memorandum released last week, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, John Holdren, has directed federal agencies that spend more than $100m (£66m; €76m) a year on research and development to come up with plans to make the published results of federally funded research freely available to the public within a year of publication.1

The memorandum also requires researchers to better account for and manage the digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research.

It came partly in response to the 65 000 people who recently signed a “We the People” petition asking for expanded public access to the results of research that is funded by the taxpayer.

In launching the memorandum Holdren directly addressed the petition. He said, “The Obama administration agrees that citizens deserve easy access to the results of research their tax dollars have paid for. Your petition has been important to our discussions of this issue.”

He added that the policy provided the “flexibility to make changes in the future based on experience and evidence.”

“For example, agencies have been asked to use a 12 month embargo period as a guide for developing their policies, but also to provide a mechanism for stakeholders to petition the agency to change that period,” he said.

The memorandum lays out a list of requirements for all publicly funded research agencies. Among its instructions it demands that all agency plans include:

A strategy for maximizing use of existing archives, where appropriate, and fostering public-private partnerships with scientific journals that are relevant to the agency’s research

A strategy for improving the public’s ability to locate and access digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, and

An approach to optimizing search, archival, and dissemination features that encourages innovation in accessibility and interoperability.

Agencies have been given six months to submit a plan in line with the specifications of the memorandum.
