Three of the footnotes were confusing and redundant in table 2 of this paper by Siân Sweetland and colleagues (BMJ 2009;339:b4583, doi:10.1136/bmj.b4583). The asterisk, the single dagger, and the double dagger symbols should be ignored in the headings, and the related footnotes should also be ignored.
