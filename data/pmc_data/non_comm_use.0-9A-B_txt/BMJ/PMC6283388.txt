periconceptional use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
increased risk of congenital heart defects in offspring is modified by maternal
or infant genetic variants in folate, homocysteine, or transsulfuration
pathways.

Design Population based study. DNA from mothers, fathers, and
infants was genotyped with an Illumina GoldenGate custom single nucleotide
polymorphism panel. A hybrid design based on a log linear model was used to
calculate relative risks and Bayesian false discovery probabilities (BFDP) to
identify polymorphisms associated with congenital heart defects modified by SSRI
use.

Data sources Data from the US National Birth Defects Prevention
Study on 1180 liveborn infants with congenital heart defects and 1644 controls,
born 1997-2008.

Main outcome measures Cases included infants with selected
congenital heart defects and control infants had no major defects. SSRI use was
obtained from telephone interviews with mothers.

Results For women who reported taking SSRIs periconceptionally,
maternal SHMT1 (rs9909104) GG and AGgenotypes were associated with a 5.9
and 2.4 increased risk of select congenital heart defects in offspring,
respectively, versus the AA genotype (BFDP=0.69). Compared with the AA genotype,
BHMT (rs492842 and rs542852) GG and AG genotypes were associated with twice the
riskof congenital heart defects (BFDP=0.74 and 0.79, respectively). MGST1
(rs2075237) CC and ACgenotypes were associated with an increased risk
compared with the GG genotype (8.0 and 2.8, respectively; BFDP=0.79). Single
nucleotide polymorphism in infant genes in the folate (MTHFS rs12438477),
homocysteine (TRDMT1 rs6602178 and GNMT rs11752813) and transsulfuration (GSTP1
rs7941395 and MGST1 rs7294985) pathways were also associated with an increased
risk of congenital heart defects.

Conclusions Common maternal or infant genetic variants in folate,
homocysteine, or transsulfuration pathways are associated with an increased risk
of certain congenital heart defects among children of women taking SSRIs during
cardiogenesis.
==== Body
Introduction
In the US the prevalence of depression is high in women of childbearing age.1 The prevalence of clinical antenatal
depression is 10-15%,2 and 8-13% of pregnant
women are prescribed antidepressant drugs.3
4
5
6 Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) are the most common class of antidepressants prescribed during
pregnancy.3
5
7 Their effectiveness is attributed, in
part, to their ability to increase the post-synaptic availability of the
neurotransmitter serotonin by inhibiting the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT or
5-HTT), resulting in reduced symptoms of depression among many patients.8
9
10
11
12 5-HT is also a vital signaling molecule
in cardiogenesis. Consequently, if present during cardiogenesis, SSRIs could
interfere with 5-HT signaling, resulting in several different types of congenital
heart defects.9
11 Infants with such defects have an
increased risk of morbidity and mortality.13

Epidemiologic studies have produced inconsistent results regarding the impact of
maternal use of SSRIs during embryogenesis. Some studies have reported an increased
risk of congenital heart defects,1

39 These inconsistent results could be a
consequence of a complex relation between similar risk factors, genetics, behaviors,
and metabolic pathways for both mental illness and congenital heart defects. Women
are prescribed SSRIs for various illnesses, including but not limited to depression,
panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These psychiatric conditions are
associated with poorer health behaviors and obstetric outcomes. For example, women
diagnosed with depression are more likely than the general population to have
concomitant behaviors and health conditions independently associated with an
increased risk of congenital heart defects, including prenatal cigarette smoking,
alcohol and/or illicit drug use, poor diet,25

66 Polymorphisms in genes involved in the

heart defects53

69 and depression.70

Three metabolic pathways implicated in an increased risk of congenital heart
defects—folate, homocysteine, and glutathione/transsulfuration pathways—could be
related to pathways involved in synthesis of serotonin and other important
neurotransmitters that influence depression. L-methylfolate, the biologically active
form of folate, regulates the formation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is
involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and
norepinephrine.10
12 Because of the potential interplay
between folate, homocysteine, depression, and congenital heart defects, we
hypothesized that the impact of SSRIs on cardiogenesis could be modulated by common
maternal or infant genetic variants in folate and homocysteine related pathways.
Thus, it is plausible that maternal or infant genetic variants within these pathways
augment the adverse effects of SSRIs if key protein or enzyme production is
inhibited or amplified. We examined the potential impact of common allelic variants
in maternal and infant genes involved in the folate, homocysteine, and
glutathione/transsulfuration metabolic pathways on the association between maternal
periconceptional use of SSRIs and risk of congenital heart defects in their
offspring.

Methods
We tested our hypothesis with a case control design using data from the National
Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). This was the largest population based case
control study conducted in the US and was designed to investigate the contribution
of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors to the occurrence of major
non-syndromic birth defects.73
74 Briefly, families with affected children
(cases) and control families were identified from population based birth defects
surveillance systems in 10 US states, specifically Arkansas, California, Georgia,
Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The
study enrolled non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Asian women and
their families. Our analysis included non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Hispanic families of infants with estimated dates of delivery from October 1997 to
August 2008.

Our study population consisted of 1180 case families with singleton liveborn infants
with a diagnosis of a conotruncal or right or left obstructive heart defect within
the first year of life and 1644 control families with singleton liveborn infants
without any diagnosed major structural birth defect who provided a genetic sample.
Infants with congenital heart defects affected by a known single gene disorder,
chromosomal abnormality, or syndrome were excluded. In each surveillance program,
trained staff abstracted medical records and actively ascertained cases from
hospitals, birthing centers, and other medical facilities. For NBDPS, controls were
randomly selected (one control to three cases) by each program from the same
underlying population area as case infants from birth certificate records or
hospital discharge logs. The number of controls selected each month for the overall
study was proportionate to the number of births in the same month in the prior
year.74

Ascertainment of infants with congenital heart defects
Cases were identified based on the infant having at least one of the following
diagnostic procedures: echocardiograms, surgical reports, cardiac
catheterizations, or autopsies. A pediatric cardiologist at each study center
then reviewed all information on diagnostic procedures to ensure uniform
criteria for diagnoses. Classification of congenital heart defects was done
centrally by pediatric cardiologists, using the classification system
specifically developed for the NBDPS, which incorporates cardiac phenotype,
cardiac complexity, and extra-cardiac anomalies.75 In our study, conotruncal defects included truncus
arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch type B, transposition of the great arteries,
double outlet right ventricle, conoventricular septal defects, tetralogy of
Fallot, and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect.75 Obstructive heart defects (left or
right) included hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia, pulmonary
valve atresia, coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch types A and C,
aortic stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, and Ebstein’s anomaly.75

Ascertainment of maternal use of SSRIs 
After they had given informed consent, mothers of affected children and controls
completed a one hour computer assisted telephone interview administered in
English or Spanish.73
76 During the interview, women were
asked about periconceptional (that is, one month before conception through to
three months after conception of the index pregnancy) folic acid supplementation
and maternal drug use. For our study, we defined periconceptional folic acid
supplementation as use for at least two months during the exposure window. SSRI
use was defined as any use of the following medications: fluoxetine (Sarafem,
Prozac, Prozac Weekly, Selfemra, Rapiflux), fluvoxamine (Luvox, Luvox CR),
paroxetine (Pexeva, Brisdelle, Paxil, Paxil CR), escitalopram (Lexapro),
citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), and vortioxetine (Brintellix), for any
indication during the periconception period.

DNA sample collection
After completing the maternal telephone interview, case and control families were
mailed buccal swab kits for collection of maternal, infant, and paternal DNA
samples.73
76 DNA sample storage and processing
methods for the NBDPS have been described in detail elsewhere.76
77 We included all cases and controls
who had DNA samples available (mother, infant, and father, or any paired
combination).

Genotyping and quality control
We selected a custom panel of 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 62 genes
involved in the folate, homocysteine, and glutathione/transsulfuration metabolic
pathways or DNA synthesis/repair for analysis.78 We performed genotyping using 200 ng of whole genome amplified
DNA on Illumina’s customizable GoldenGate platform.79 We uses Puregene DNA purification reagents (Qiagen,
Valencia CA) to extract DAN from buccal brush samples. The resultant genomic DNA
was quantified with TaqMan RNase P Detection Reagents Kit (Life Technologies,
ThermoFisher) and a standard curve of DNA of known DNA concentration.

Genomic DNA extracted from buccal samples was subjected to whole genome
amplification. Briefly, 10-15 ng of genomic DNA was amplified with the
GenomePlex kit (Sigm Chemical, Saint Louis MO) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The whole genome amplified product was quantified by the TaqMan RNase
P Detection Reagents Kit, and 200 ng was used as input DNA for the Illumina
Golden Gate assay. The performance of whole genome amplified DNA in microarray
analysis was previously demonstrated by Cunningham and colleagues.80

Initial genotyping calls were generated with GenCall, Illumina’s proprietary
algorithm. We found that the quality of genotype clustering varied substantially
from one single nucleotide polymorphism to another on the GoldenGate custom
platform, whether we used blood or buccal samples. We therefore developed
SNPMClust, a bivariate Gaussian model based genotype calling algorithm to
complement the default Illumina GenCall algorithm and applied strict quality
control measures.81 We tested this
method in a pilot study (described in detail by Hobbs and colleagues68) on blood and buccal samples from 94
women. We found a 99.2% concordance rate between whole genome amplified buccal
DNA and blood derived DNA among genotype calls and are therefore confident in
the genotypes we used.

We genotyped 6416 individual samples and removed 576 samples from analysis
because of study ineligibility, low genotype call rates, or high rates of
Mendelian inconsistency, resulting in an analytic sample consisting of 5840
individuals from 1180 case and 1644 control families. To ensure high quality
genetic data, we applied stringent quality control criteria and excluded single
nucleotide polymorphisms with obviously poor clustering behavior, no call rates
>10%, Mendelian error rates >5%, minor allele frequencies <5%, or
significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in at least one racial
group (P<10−4). After the quality assessment, the analytical data
had 872 variants in total.

Statistical methods
We calculated summary statistics for main study variables: means with standard
deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for
categorical variables. We compared the distributions of continuous variables
between cases and controls using independent two sample t tests
and the proportions of categorical variables using χ2 tests. Log
linear models based on the hybrid design82 were used for analysis as we genotyped both triads of
case-parents and control-parents; this method is the most optimal and
appropriate statistical approach.82 The
log linear model was fitted for each single nucleotide polymorphism as a
function of: mating types (three possible genotypes for each parent); the
interaction between mating types and SSRI exposure; disease status
(case/control); maternal genotypes; infant genotypes; the interaction between
disease status and maternal genotypes; the interaction between disease status
and infant genotypes; the interaction between disease status, maternal
genotypes, and SSRI exposure; and the interaction between disease status, infant
genotypes, and SSRI exposure. This model specification assessed the interaction
between maternal genotype and SSRI exposure and the interaction between infant
genotype and SSRI exposure. We assumed a log additive model (multiplicative risk
of alleles), in which the genotype was coded as 0, 1, and 2, indicating zero,
one, and two copies of the minor allele. Under this assumption, the relative
risk of carrying two copies of the allele is the square of the relative risk of
carrying one copy of the same allele, with zero copies as the reference.

We also calculated the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP)83 for the interaction between maternal
genotype and SSRI exposure and the interaction between infant genotype and SSRI
exposure using the interaction estimates from the log linear models. This
probability balances the relative cost between a false negative and a false
positive finding; in the results section, we report associations where
probability <0.8 and 95% confidence intervals where α=0.05. Probability
<0.8 is widely used to indicate noteworthy findings in candidate gene based
association studies with strong prior knowledge that the selected genes are
likely to be associated with the disease.84
85
86 We used statistical software R
v3.1.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna) for computing summary
statistics, performing tests, and calculating Bayesian false discovery
probabilities. LEM87 statistical
software was used to fit log linear models with incomplete family genotype data
by using the expectation maximization algorithm.88

Results
Of 1180 affected infants (cases), 616 had conotruncal defects and 569 had obstructive
heart defects. There were no significant differences in sociodemographic or maternal
periconceptional characteristics between cases and controls, including folic acid
supplementation and prenatal maternal cigarette smoking (tables 1 and 2), with the exception of maternal body mass
index (BMI). Case mothers were more likely to be overweight and obese than control
mothers (P<0.002). Overall the prevalence of SSRI use during the periconceptional
period was relatively low. Only 5% of case and 3% of control mothers reported SSRI
use during the relevant period, but the difference was significant (P<0.04). The
prevalence of SSRI use did not differ between mothers of infants with a conotruncal
or obstructive heart defect. The SSRIs most commonly taken during the periconception
period by women in our study were sertraline (38.7%), fluoxetine (27.0%), and
paroxetine (21.6%). No one reported using fluvoxamine or vortioxetine (table 3).

Maternal genotype and risk of congenital heart defects
We included 872 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 60 genes in the final
analyses. There was a significant (BFDP <0.8) increased risk of congenital
heart defects for maternal genotypes for four single nucleotide polymorphisms in
three genes—serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (soluble) (SHMT1),
betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), and microsomal glutathione
S-transferase 1 (MGST1)—among women taking SSRIs during the periconceptional
period (table 4). Overall, the risk of having
an infant with a congenital heart defect was higher for women with homozygous
minor alleles than for women with only one copy of the minor allele. Among women
reporting periconceptional use of SSRIs during pregnancy, those who had one or
two minor allele (G) copies of rs9909104 in SHMT1 had increased risks of
congenital heart defects in offspring compared with exposed women who carried no
copies (relative risk 2.43 (95% confidence interval 1.46 to 4.03) and 5.90 (2.13
to 16.24), respectively). SSRI users who were heterozygous (AG allele) for two
single nucleotide polymorphisms on the BHMT gene had an increased risk of a
congenital heart defect if they took SSRIs during the periconception period
(2.15 (1.33 to 3.46) for rs492842 and 2.06 (1.26 to 3.34) for rs542852) compared
with women who did not take SSRIs during the periconception period and had the
AA allele. SSRI users who were homozygous for the G allele of the rs492842 and
the rs542852 single nucleotide polymorphisms had over four times the risk of
having an affected child (4.62, 1.77 to 11.97). The greatest risk of having an
affected child was found in women who took SSRIs during the periconception
period and had the CC and AC alleles for rs2075237 on gene MGST1 (7.95 (2.50 to
25.40) and 2.82 (1.58 to 5.04), respectively) compared with women who had the AA
allele.

Infant genotypes and risk of congenital heart defect
We also observed a significant increased risk of congenital heart defects for
infant genotypes (table 4). We observed
increased risk in three single nucleotide polymorphisms in three genes involved
in the transsulfuration pathway: O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT),
glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1), and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1
(MGST1). Infants who had the AG allele in single nucleotide polymorphisms
rs11511217 on gene MGMT, rs7941395 on GSTP1, and rs7294985 on MGST1 also had
increased risk of congenital heart defects if their mothers took SSRIs during
the periconceptional period (relative risks 2.41 (95% confidence interval 1.45
to 4.01), 2.17 (1.38 to 3.41), and 2.47 (1.45 to 4.21), respectively). Infants
with periconceptional exposure to SSRIs who had the GG allele on the same single
nucleotide polymorphisms had increased risks of congenital heart defects,
ranging from 4.71 to 6.10. The greatest risk for having an infant with a
congenital heart defect occurred in women who took SSRIs during the
periconception period and had an infant with the AA and AC alleles for
rs12438477 on 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) gene (6.76 (2.56
to 17.89) and 2.60 (1.60 to 4.23), respectively) compared with an exposed infant
with the CC allele. Increased risks of congenital heart defects were also seen
in infants with variants in single nucleotide polymorphisms in two genes
involved in the homocysteine pathway, tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1
(TRDMT1) and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). Women had about twice the risk
of having an infant with a congenital heart defect if she was exposed to a
periconceptional SSRI and had an infant with the allele AC on single nucleotide
polymorphism rs66022178 in the TRDMT1 gene or the CG allele on single nucleotide
polymorphism rs11752813 in the GNMT gene (1.79 (1.14 to 2.80) and 1.80 (1.15 to
2.80), respectively). For both single nucleotide polymorphisms in the respective
genes, the risks were 3.2 (1.30 to 7.84 and 1.32 to 7.84) for the CC
alleles.

Subgroup analysis
We conducted subanalyses to determine whether risk varied by subgroup of
congenital heart defect (table 5). We did not
find any significant risk ratios among conotruncal heart defects (as determined
by BFDP) but did find increased risk by maternal and infant genotype for
obstructive heart defects among periconceptional SSRI users. The risk was
evident only for single nucleotide polymorphisms on the TRDMT1 gene. The risk
ratio for women who took an SSRI during the periconception period and had the AG
or GG genotype for polymorphism rs2038576 in the TRDMT1 gene was 4.64 (95%
confidence interval 2.20 to 9.77) and 21.53 (4.84 to 95.45), respectively)
compared with exposed women with the AA genotype. For women taking SSRIs during
the periconception period with the AG or GG genotype for polymorphism rs2273735
in the TRDMT1 gene the relative risks were 3.20 (1.67 to 6.10) and 10.24 (2.79
to 37.21) compared with women with the AA genotype exposed to SSRIs.

Similar to our findings for maternal genotypes, increased risk was observed only
for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TRDMT1 gene for infant genotypes.
Relative risks ranged from 2.61 to 3.00, and the greatest risk was for infants
with the AG on polymorphism rs10795459 (relative risk 3.0, 95% confidence
interval 1.63 to 5.51). Risks ranged from 6.81 to 9.00 for the homozygous
alleles on the respective single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Discussion
In this population based study we found that common single nucleotide polymorphisms,
related to glutathione and one-carbon metabolism, modified the risk of birth defects
such that mothers with specific genotypes and periconceptual SSRI use had more than
twice the risk of having an infant with an obstructive or conotruncal heart defect.
Likewise, infants with maternal SSRI exposure and specific genotypes had 1.79 to
2.60 times the risk of the included heart defects. A subgroup analysis showed that
two maternal and three infant single nucleotide polymorphisms, each within TRDMT1,
were strongly associated with development of an obstructive heart defect. In
contrast, we found no interaction among genotype, SSRI exposure, and risk of
conotruncal heart defects. These findings provide insight into the genetic
susceptibility of congenital heart defects to maternal SSRI use around pregnancy and
provide support for our effect modification hypothesis.

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of our study include its large multi-ethnic population based sample
size, verification of diagnoses, and standardization of classification of
congenital heart defects across study centers. Unlike many previous
investigations of SSRI use and risk of congenital heart defects, our information
on exposure was based on maternal self report, which is a better measure of
drugs taken rather than drugs prescribed during the exposure window.
Furthermore, the use of the log linear model for our analyses enabled us to
assess the simultaneous effects of maternal and infant genotype on risk of
congenital heart defects among SSRI users and non-users. This analytic approach
also controls for possible population stratification of the infant’s
genotype.

Some potential limitations, however, should be considered. Information concerning
periconceptional SSRI use could be subject to measurement error and recall bias
as women were asked 12-24 months after delivery to report use. We also examined
the effects of all SSRIs combined and did not assess the effects of specific
SSRIs. Although we examined the use of periconceptional folic acid
supplementation we did not assess dietary intake of folate and its role on the
association between SSRI use and risk of congenital heart defects in our
population. The DNA used in our study was obtained from self collected buccal
cheek cell samples, which resulted in variable quality of samples. Although the
hybrid design is the most appropriate method for analyzing our trio data, a
current limitation of this statistical approach is inability to include
potential confounders in the model. Despite our fairly large sample size, only a
small number of women took SSRIs during the periconception period. Although the
log linear model adjusts for potential confounding by population stratification,
we assessed our results only among non-Hispanic white mothers because 85% of
SSRI users fell into this ethnic group. Results from this homogenous subgroup
were similar to those from the full sample, including significant associations
for the maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms on SHMT and BHMT and infant
single nucleotide polymorphisms on MTHFS (table 6).

Comparison with previous studies
We found no directly comparable studies when we searched PubMed for studies
published in English before 2016 that investigated the association between
maternal or infant genotype and risk of congenital heart defects among women
taking SSRIs during pregnancy. We have therefore provided comparisons with the
broader literature. An earlier study also using data from the NBDPS did not find
a significantly increased risk of conotruncal defects (odds ratio 1.3, 95%
confidence interval 0.8 to 2.1) among women taking an SSRI during
pregnancy.32
76 A 2015 study using 1997-2009 data
from the NBDPS, however, reported significant associations between maternal use
of the SSRIs fluoxetine or paroxetine and atrial septal defects (1.8, 1.1 to
3.0) and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects (2.4, 1.4 to
3.9).76 An earlier case control
study conducted in the US also reported similar findings.39 A large Norwegian study showed an increased risk of
congenital heart defects among infants exposed to any SSRI during early
pregnancy (1.15, 1.05 to 1.26) and reported a significant association between
SSRI exposure and right ventricular outflow tract obstructions (1.48, 1.15 to
1.89).91 A sibling controlled
analysis within the Norwegian study, however, did not find a significant
association between SSRI exposure and congenital heart defects. In our study,
over half of the women who took SSRIs were taking sertaline or fluoxetine, both
of which show little evidence for increased risk of congenital heart defects in
empiric studies or meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies,7
35
36 yet we still observed an increased
risk of such defects among women and infants with common allelic variants.

Potential mechanisms
Our findings highlighted single nucleotide polymorphisms related to one-carbon
metabolism and the transsulfuration pathway. One-carbon metabolism encompasses
both the folate and methionine/homocysteine cycles and is integral to cardiac
development.92 It supports nutrient
metabolism and other processes vital to a developing heart. It supplies methyl
groups to DNA, RNA, and chromatin, allowing the body to maintain tight control
over gene transcription during cardiogenesis. The transsulfuration pathway is
another important component of one-carbon metabolism. One of its most important
byproducts is glutathione,92
93
94 an antioxidant that helps the
developing heart resist damage from reactive oxygen species and xenobiotic
compounds.68
95 The single nucleotide polymorphisms
reported in this study could serve as markers for nearby functional variants (a
genetic variant that alters the function of the gene). Alternatively, they could
directly affect protein expression and function. Most of the single nucleotide
polymorphisms identified in the results introduce new splice sites and could
alter protein function as a result (rs9909104, rs492842, rs542852, rs11511217,
rs7294985, rs2038576, rs2273735, rs17464824, rs10904893). The remaining
polymorphisms do not seem to directly impact protein function. Instead, they
could be marking nearby functional variants.

There are several mechanisms that could account for the results. Variants in two
genes, SHMT1 and MTHFS, within the folate pathway were associated with an
increased risk of congenital heart defects among women with SSRI exposure during
early pregnancy. Both genes encode proteins that catalyze the conversion of
folate metabolites into 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, a folate pathway
intermediate that provides methyl groups for biosynthesis of thymidylate and
purines.96 Neither SHMT1 nor MTHFS
participate in the synthesis or turnover of 5-HT (serotonin), and it seems
unlikely that these two single nucleotide polymorphisms interact directly with
5-HT during cardiac development. We hypothesize that variants within these genes
sensitize an embryo to alterations in 5-HT, a critical cardiac signaling
molecule.97
98 SHMT1 and MTHFS are both vital to
embryonic development, and defects in SHMT1 can impair hippocampal
neurogenesis99 and cause neural
tube defects in mouse models.100 The
polymorphism identified in SHMT1 (rs9909104) is associated with increased risk
of ovarian cancer,101 and a second
polymorphisms (rs669340) within SHMT1 is associated with development of neural
tube defect.102 Meanwhile, mice
lacking the MTHFS gene do not survive past the embryonic stage, and mice with
only one functional allele showed a 50% reduction in de novo purine
synthesis.103 MTHFS rs12438477 was
associated with conotruncal heart defects in one of our previous studies.68 Our present study identified an
association between rs12438477 within MTHFS and an increased risk of congenital
heart defects among infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy.

Allelic variants in three genes involved in the homocysteine pathway—BHMT, GNMT,
and TRDMT1—were also associated with increased risk of congenital heart defects
in the presence of periconceptional SSRIs. BHMT facilitates homocysteine
re-methylation into methionine.104 The
enzyme encoded by GNMT is critical in regulating cellular concentration of
S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet).105
TRDMT1 (formerly DNMT2) encodes a methyltransferase that stabilizes aspartic
acid and transfer RNA and supports protein synthesis.106 Deletion of BHMT in mice leads to major
perturbations in choline, homocysteine, and AdoMet. In humans, polymorphisms in
BHMT were associated with decreased circulating concentrations of the
antioxidant glutathione.68 Excess
homocysteine is thought to cause endothelial damage in adults107and is associated with increased risk
of congenital heart defects in newborns.10
108
109 Evidence from animal models
suggests that homocysteine might increase risk of congenital heart defects
either by increasing oxidative stress110 or by binding to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
resulting in abnormal cardiac neural crest cell migration and
differentiation.111

We found three genes involved in the transsulfuration pathway—MGST1, MGMT, and
GSTP—that were associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects
among women taking SSRIs. MGST1 is involved in “conjugation of glutathione to
electrophiles and the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides” (RefSeq Accession
NM_145792.2). This reaction is one of the mechanisms by which glutathione, a
product of the transsulfuration pathway, protects intracellular membranes from
oxidative stress. The GST gene family produces enzymes involved in
detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of many hydrophobic and
electrophilic compounds with reduced glutathione. The GSTP1 gene is believed to
catalyze the detoxification of xenobiotics (chemical compounds—as drugs,
pesticides, or carcinogens—that are foreign to a living organism)112 and byproducts of oxidative stress;
they could play a role in susceptibility to cancer and other diseases, as this
gene is often upregulated in neoplastic cells (RefSeq Accession
NM_000853.3).

Dysfunction in either the transsulfuration pathway or the homocysteine pathways
can lead to an increased level of oxidative stress.110 Oxidative stress can in turn decrease the
bioavailability of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4),113 a critical precursor for 5-HT (serotonin). Increased
oxidative stress in the presence of 5-HT can also promote the formation of
harmful free radicals, which could damage developing cardiac tissue.114
115 Although the teratogenic effects
of SSRIs on the fetal heart are postulated to occur through interference of 5-HT
signaling during cardiogenesis,11 the
specific role of the common variants and/or genes is poorly understood in these
three metabolic pathways in the association between depression, metabolism of
SSRIs, and increased risk of congenital heart defects. These genes, however,
have previously been investigated for their role in risk of congenital heart
defects. Hobbs and colleagues reported a 1.8 increased risk of congenital heart
defects among obese women carrying the 742G>A polymorphism in BHMT,116 and Mitchell and colleagues also
showed a similar pattern of increased risk for left sided of congenital heart
defects for the same polymorphism, though not significant.117 Li and colleagues found significant main effects for
different fetal polymorphisms in the MGMT and MTHFS genes.118 Zhu and colleagues investigated rs9909104 on SHMT1
for its association with increased risk of congenital heart defects but found no
association.119

These complex relations could partially explain the conflicting epidemiologic
literature concerning the teratogenicity of SSRI use during the periconception
period as studies that do show an association do not distinguish between
pharmaceutical effects and the underlying effects of depression and its
associated behaviors and conditions. Several investigators posited confounding
by indication to explain the reported associations in the literature.4
120 One large US epidemiologic study
that restricted the study population to depressed women (as opposed to adjusting
for depression) to account for potential confounding by indication and
associated behaviors found no association between prenatal SSRI exposure and
risk of congenital heart defects.4 A
nationwide study in Denmark found an increased risk of such defects for women
taking SSRIs during pregnancy and for women who stopped taking SSRIs six months
before conception of the index pregnancy,92 which also supports the potential confounding effect of maternal
illness. Although recent cohort studies conducted in the US4 and the UK121
reported significant associations between SSRI use (paroxetine) and congenital
heart defects, the associations were not significant in fully adjusted models
restricted to women with depression. We hypothesized that some women might have
an increased genetic susceptibility to possible adverse effects of SSRIs on the
developing heart. Polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism are
associated with increased risk of congenital heart defects68

128 and depression.70

129 Thus, we postulate that some women
who take SSRIs during cardiogenesis could be at higher risk if they have genetic
polymorphisms in other folate metabolism related genes.

Future directions and conclusions
Our results provide initial evidence of a modifying effect of common maternal and
infant variants in genes that encode for critical enzymes in the folate,
homocysteine, and glutathione/transulfuration pathways on the association
between maternal periconceptional SSRI use and risk of congenital heart defects
in their offspring. Given the widespread use of SSRIs among women for various
conditions, further exploration is warranted of the complex association between
risk of congenital heart defects and folate supplementation, periconceptional
SSRI use, and variants in folate, homocysteine, and glutathione/transsulfuration
pathways among women with psychiatric illness.

What is already known on this topic
Epidemiologic studies have produced inconsistent results
regarding the impact of the maternal use of SSRIs during
embryogenesis on congenital heart defects

These inconsistent results could be a consequence of a complex
relation between competing risk factors, behaviors, and
metabolic pathways for both mental illness and congenital heart
defects

Low serum or red blood cell folate and/or raised homocysteine
concentrations are associated with an increased risk of both
congenital heart defects and depression; whereas folate
supplementation could lower the risk, diminish depressive
symptoms, and overcome drug resistant depression

What this study adds
Common allelic variants in maternal and infant genes involved in
the folate, homocysteine, and glutathione/transulfuration
metabolic pathways can modify the association between maternal
periconceptional use of SSRIs and risk of congenital heart
defects
