This Research paper (BMJ 2013;347:f6745, doi:10.1136/bmj.f6745) contains two errors pertaining to the references that have been cited to support statements in the text. Firstly, the first sentence in the third paragraph of the “Discussion” section (“In the past decade, studies have found varying associations between diabetes risk and use of β blockers, diuretics, and statins”) cites references 18 and 19. In fact, these two references only refer to studies that researched diabetes risk and use of β blockers or diuretics. Reference 28 (Freeman DJ, Norrie J, Sattar N, Neely RD, Cobbe SM, Ford I, et al. Pravastatin and the development of diabetes mellitus: evidence for a protective treatment effect in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study. Circulation 2001;103:357-62) should have also been cited to support the assertion in this sentence about diabetes risk and use of statins.

Secondly, in the second paragraph of the section “Strengths and limitations of this study” the authors state that “intensive dose (versus lower dose) statins may be associated with an increased risk of new onset diabetes.” However, instead of citing reference 7 after this statement, the following study should have been cited: Preiss D, Seshasai SR, Welsh P, Murphy SA, Ho JE, Waters DD, et al. Risk of incident diabetes with intensive-dose compared with moderate-dose statin therapy: a meta-analysis. JAMA 2011;305(24):2556-64.
