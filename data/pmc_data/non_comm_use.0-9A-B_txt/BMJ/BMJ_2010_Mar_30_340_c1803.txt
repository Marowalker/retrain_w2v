A few errors occurred during the editing of this paper by B H Strand and colleagues (BMJ 2010;340:582, doi:10.1136/bmj.c654). The captions for figures 2-4 should have made it clear that the trends were for educational inequalities in mortality (not inequalities in education). Also, a change to the figure numbering during editing meant that the “web extra” figure 1 was incorrectly cited as figure 2 in the results sections for cardiovascular mortality, external causes and suicide, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease.
