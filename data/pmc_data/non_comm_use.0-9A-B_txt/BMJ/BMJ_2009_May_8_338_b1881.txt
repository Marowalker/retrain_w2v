A transcribing error occurred in the production of figures 2, 3, and 4 of the online version of this article by Alexander C Ford and colleagues (BMJ 2008;337:a2313, doi:10.1136/bmj.a2313). The x axis of these forest plots should have had values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 for relative risk (not −0.1, −0.2, −0.5, 0, 2, 5, 10 as shown). In a graph of relative risks it is not possible to plot zero, nor can a relative risk have a negative value.
