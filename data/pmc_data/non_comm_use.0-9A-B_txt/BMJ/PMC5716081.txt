On publication of this Practice paper (BMJ 2017;358:j4090, doi:10.1136/bmj.j4090), the main graphical summary of the evidence for this recommendation contained an error. For the outcome “Complete pain resolution (48 hrs),” the value of 608 people per 1000 (183 more) was stated for those people taking steroids. The correct value should have been 629 per 1000 (204 more), as stated in the systematic review supporting the recommendation (www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3887). This error has been corrected in the graphical summary.
