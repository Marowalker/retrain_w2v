daily injections for adults with type 1 diabetes, with both groups receiving
equivalent training in flexible insulin treatment.

Design Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, cluster
randomised controlled trial (Relative Effectiveness of Pumps Over MDI and Structured
Education (REPOSE) trial).

Setting Eight secondary care centres in England and Scotland.

Participants Adults with type 1 diabetes who were willing to undertake
intensive insulin treatment, with no preference for pumps or multiple daily
injections. Participants were allocated a place on established group training courses
that taught flexible intensive insulin treatment (“dose adjustment for normal
eating,” DAFNE). The course groups (the clusters) were then randomly allocated in
pairs to either pump or multiple daily injections.

Interventions Participants attended training in flexible insulin
treatment (using insulin analogues) structured around the use of pump or injections,
followed for two years.

Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were a change in glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1c) values (%) at two years in participants with baseline HbA1c value
of ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and the proportion of participants achieving an HbA1c value
of <7.5%. Secondary outcomes included body weight, insulin dose, and episodes of
moderate and severe hypoglycaemia. Ancillary outcomes included quality of life and
treatment satisfaction.

Results 317 participants (46 courses) were randomised (156 pump and 161
injections). 267 attended courses and 260 were included in the intention to treat
analysis, of which 235 (119 pump and 116 injection) had baseline HbA1c values of
≥7.5%. Glycaemic control and rates of severe hypoglycaemia improved in both groups.
The mean change in HbA1c at two years was −0.85% with pump treatment and −0.42% with
multiple daily injections. Adjusting for course, centre, age, sex, and accounting for
missing values, the difference was −0.24% (−2.7 mmol/mol) in favour of pump users
(95% confidence interval −0.53 to 0.05, P=0.10). Most psychosocial measures showed no
difference, but pump users showed greater improvement in treatment satisfaction and
some quality of life domains (dietary freedom and daily hassle) at 12 and 24
months.

Conclusions Both groups showed clinically relevant and long lasting
decreases in HbA1c, rates of severe hypoglycaemia, and improved psychological
measures, although few participants achieved glucose levels currently recommended by
national and international guidelines. Adding pump treatment to structured training
in flexible intensive insulin treatment did not substantially enhance educational
benefits on glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia, or psychosocial outcomes in adults with
type 1 diabetes. These results do not support a policy of providing insulin pumps to
adults with poor glycaemic control until the effects of training on participants’
level of engagement in intensive self management have been determined.

==== Body
Introduction
People with type 1 diabetes mellitus require lifelong treatment with insulin to prevent
diabetic ketoacidosis and to optimise blood glucose levels to minimise vascular
complications.1 Insulin is generally
administered by multiple daily subcutaneous injections, using different insulins to
cover background and meal requirements. Doses are adjusted according to eating, physical
activity, and blood glucose level. This approach and its integration within flexible
lifestyles is promoted in “dose adjustment for normal eating” (DAFNE)2 and similar structured training courses.3 Despite this training and best efforts, many
people struggle to achieve glycaemic targets and a considerable proportion go on to
develop serious complications, reducing both the length and the quality of their
lives.1
4

In continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, a pump delivers insulin continuously under
the skin through a small plastic tube and cannula.5
6 Pumps are filled with quick acting insulin to
supply both background insulin and insulin replacement after meals.

Potential advantages include more precise insulin delivery and the ability to adjust
basal insulin levels. Observational studies have reported improved glucose control,
reduced risk of hypoglycaemia, and enhanced quality of life. Pump treatment is more
expensive than multiple daily injections, with pumps costing around £2500 ($3041; €2800)
each plus £1500 a year for consumables (cannulas, reservoirs, and batteries).7

In the UK, pump use is approved in adults with type 1 diabetes who have high glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1c) values (>8.5%) or an inability to achieve reasonable control
without “disabling hypoglycaemia.”8 An estimated
6% of UK adults with type 1 diabetes use pumps, which is lower than in many comparable
countries.9 Around 40% of people with type 1
diabetes in the USA use pumps,10 and proponents
of pumps suggest that far more people should be offered them in the UK.11

One weakness of existing evidence is that patients allocated to pumps are likely to have
received more training and attention than those using multiple daily injections. A
recent observational study12 of pump treatment
and injections, where both groups received intensive education in insulin usage,
concluded that the training might have made the most difference. To our knowledge, no
randomised trials in adults have compared pump treatment with multiple daily injections
where the same structured training in insulin adjustment has been provided, so the added
benefit of pump technology remains unclear.

In the Relative Effectiveness of Pumps Over MDI and Structured Education (REPOSE) trial
we assessed the effectiveness of adding pump treatment to high quality equivalent
structured education in flexible intensive insulin treatment for people with type 1
diabetes, comparing pump plus education with multiple daily injections plus education.
Our hypothesis was that much of the benefit of pump treatment might come from the
re-training and education in insulin use given to enable patients to use pumps safely.
We present the clinical effectiveness and quantitative psychosocial results of this
pragmatic trial.

Methods
Trial design
The study protocol has been previously published.13 In brief, we conducted a multicentre, parallel group, open label,
confirmatory, cluster randomised controlled trial. Eight secondary care centres
(three in Scotland and five in England) recruited up to 40 participants to three pump
and three multiple daily injection courses (with five to eight patients on each
course) over 11 months. Participants were allocated a place on a one week DAFNE
skills training course, with a further visit at six weeks. The course groups
(clusters) were randomly allocated in pairs to either pump or multiple daily
injections. After the courses, participants received the trial treatment for two
years. We collected outcome measures at baseline (up to three weeks before the DAFNE
course) and at six, 12, and 24 months. A cluster design was chosen to address the
challenge of randomising participants and then finding suitable times for their
attendance on a course of the correct allocation. We believe this approach reduced
both recruitment bias and attrition rates before the course.

Participants
We recruited adults with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least 12 months, and
who were willing to undertake intensive insulin treatment with self monitoring of
blood glucose levels, counting of carbohydrate intake, and insulin self adjustment,
with no preference for either pump or multiple daily injections. Participants were
those with clinical indications for structured education in insulin treatment to
optimise diabetes control who had not participated previously in structured training.
We excluded those with a strong desire for pump treatment, those already using
optimised multiple daily injections and meeting the criteria of the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence for pump treatment, those needing a pump in
the opinion of the investigator, those with serious diabetic complications, and those
unable to communicate in English. Courses (clusters) required between five and eight
participants to maintain optimal course dynamics.

Interventions
Participants using multiple daily injections attended standard DAFNE structured
education courses,2 which were conducted over
five consecutive days and delivered to groups of five to eight adults as outpatients.
The participants took insulin aspart, a quick acting insulin analogue, for meals, and
twice daily injections of insulin detemir for background replacement. They used the
Accu-Chek Aviva Expert Bolus Advisor System (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Burgess Hill, UK)
as a bolus calculator, as there is evidence that bolus advisers can improve glycaemic
control, presumably by helping patients calculate the appropriate meal related
bolus.14

Participants allocated to pump treatment attended a modified DAFNE course, previously
validated in pump users.15 That course
maintained the five day structure and the principles of insulin dose adjustment in
the standard DAFNE course, but also incorporated the practical skills and learning
outcomes needed to use pumps successfully. This necessitated an additional group
session, delivered one to three weeks before the main course. Standard DAFNE includes
a rigorous quality assurance programme. For the pump courses, fidelity testing was
undertaken to assess incorporation of appropriate pump training. Participants used a
Minimed Paradigm Veo insulin pump (model X54; Medtronic, Watford, UK) with insulin
aspart. The bolus wizard in the pumps was activated as part of the course.

The curriculum (and associated patient workbook) was adapted specifically to make
better use of pump features, compared with standard (multiple daily injections)
DAFNE. This included general pump management (infusion sets, cannulas, filling
reservoirs, changing batteries, and troubleshooting). During the five day course
participants were also taught use of the bolus wizard, basal testing and adjustment
(including fasting during the day and overnight glucose profiles), use of temporary
basal rates for physical activity or alcohol intake (reduced) and illness
(increased), use of alternative bolus “waves” (extended, multiwave), prevention of
diabetic ketoacidosis (“sick day rules” eg, when to use a pen to inject insulin in
case of cannula/pump failure, how much insulin to give and how often).

All participants (multiple daily injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusion) were invited to the course follow-up session at six to eight weeks, and
those who required additional input were offered further one-to-one appointments.
These appointments were supported by meter or pump downloads (Diasend: www.glooko.com/diasend; CareLink: www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/carelink-personal-diabetes-software),
depending on local availability. Participants were encouraged to maintain paper
record diaries to facilitate discussion and adjustments, according to the principles
taught on the course and supported by the workbook. Some might have already sought
additional help in between these planned appointments. We recorded diabetes related
contact with educators outside the course and at the six week follow-up.

Outcomes
Primary outcomes
We specified two primary outcomes. One was the change in HbA1c (%, measured
centrally) after two years in participants whose baseline HbA1c was ≥7.5% (58
mmol/mol). HbA1c is the accepted ideal surrogate measure of glycaemic control and
provides a measure of efficacy and a means of modelling long term cost
effectiveness. Our choice of this primary outcome was based on our concern that
HbA1c values might not decrease in those who entered the trial with low baseline
values, but who might be experiencing problematic hypoglycaemia. Success for such
individuals would be an HbA1c value that was maintained or even increased but with
a reduced frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (an important secondary endpoint).

The other primary endpoint was the proportion of participants reaching the 2004
NICE target of HbA1c ≤7.5% (58 mmol/mol).

Secondary outcomes
Secondary biomedical outcomes measured at six, 12, and 24 months were moderate
hypoglycaemia (an episode that could be treated by the individual, but where
hypoglycaemia caused a significant interruption of current activity leading to
impaired performance, or embarrassment, or being woken during nocturnal sleep);
severe hypoglycaemia (an episode leading to cognitive impairment sufficient to
cause either coma or requiring the assistance of another person to recover); total
and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; proteinuria; insulin dose; and
body weight. Diabetic ketoacidosis was recorded through the assessment of serious
adverse events throughout the trial.

Ancillary outcomes
Quantitative psychosocial self completed questionnaires assessed generic and
diabetes specific quality of life: SF-12 (12 item short form health survey);
WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organization quality of life–BREF); EQ-5D (EuroQol five
dimensions questionnaire); DSQOL (diabetes specific quality of life), fear of
hypoglycaemia (HFS: hypoglycaemia fear scale), satisfaction with treatment (DTSQ:
diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire), and emotional wellbeing (HADS:
hospital anxiety and depression scale) at the same time points.13

A health economic evaluation to address the question “What is the cost
effectiveness of pump treatment compared with multiple daily injections in
patients receiving the DAFNE structured education programme?” was undertaken. It
has been submitted for publication. It included a within trial and a modelled
patient lifetime analysis, the latter being the primary focus of the
evaluation.

Sample size
We calculated the sample size using a minimally clinically important difference of
0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) in HbA1c values. To detect this difference with a standard
deviation of 1% at 80% power and 5% two sided significance required 64 participants
with an HbA1c of ≥7.5% in each group. To allow for clustering of educators, an
average of seven participants per group, a within course intraclass correlation
coefficient of 0.05, and a 10% dropout rate, we required a sample size of 93 in each
group. In the DAFNE database,15 75% of
participants had an HbA1c value ≥7.5%, so we required 124 participants per group. We
planned to recruit 280 participants, which increased the power to 85% but allowed for
some variation in dropout rates and the proportion of participants with HbA1c of
≥7.5%. However, monitoring of baseline data showed the actual proportion of
participants with an HbA1c of ≥7.5% was around 90%. A modelling exercise undertaken
during recruitment with conservative estimates of 85% (HbA1c ≥7.5%) and dropout rate
of 15% suggested the trial would require at least 240 participants with primary
outcome data at two years to preserve a power of at least 85%.

Randomisation
After providing consent, participants were allocated to a training course, depending
on their availability. Courses were randomised in pairs either to DAFNE plus pump or
to DAFNE plus multiple daily injections. Simple randomisation in a block size of two,
stratified by centre, was used for the first four courses. Courses 5 onwards were
allocated in pairs using minimisation; the number of participants with baseline HbA1c
values ≥7.5% and the total number of participants were used as minimisation factors.
A statistician within Sheffield Clinical Trials Research Unit conducted the
randomisation by a user written Stata code produced to generate allocation. The trial
coordinator revealed the allocation to study sites. Participants who were unable to
attend their original course were allowed to attend a later course in the same
treatment arm, to reduce selection bias.

Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed in Stata 13 after a prespecified approved statistical
analysis plan. All analyses were by intention to treat, with participants analysed in
the groups to which they were randomised, unless otherwise specified. Participants
were included in the intention to treat analysis if they had at least one
post-baseline HbA1c measure. Those who dropped out before receiving the intervention
were substituted where possible, to ensure the courses were run with adequate numbers
of participants, but these individuals were not included in the analysis. Statistical
tests were two sided at the 5% significance level.

We analysed the change in HbA1c (%) at two years using a mixed effects model, with
centre and baseline HbA1c treated as fixed effect covariates, and course (cluster) as
a random intercept. For the primary analysis we used multiple imputation to impute
missing HbA1c data for participants with at least one follow-up HbA1c measure but
without two years outcome. We also performed a per protocol sensitivity analysis that
excluded participants who had switched treatment. Changes in HbA1c values at six
months and one year were analysed in the same way.

The proportion of participants reaching an HbA1c of <7.5% was compared between
groups using a logistic regression model adjusted for baseline HbA1c, and centre and
modelling separate courses within centre as random intercepts.

We used negative binomial mixed effects regression (to account for over-dispersion
and clustering) on the number of moderate hypoglycaemic episodes in the four weeks
before each follow-up, and occurrence of at least one moderate episode in the four
weeks before courses as a covariate and the same covariates described previously. The
number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes in two years was analysed as for moderate
hypoglycaemic episodes, with the addition of study follow-up as the exposure.
Incidence rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial random effects
regression with participant as the random effect, adjusted for baseline HbA1c value
and centre, based on the full intention to treat set (n=260).

Secondary continuous outcomes (insulin dose, body weight, high density lipoprotein
and total cholesterol levels) were analysed as for the primary outcome. We
categorised proteinuria as macroalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, or normal and analysed
using mixed effects ordered logistic regression adjusted for clustering by course
(random effect), centre, and baseline HbA1c (fixed effects).

Changes in psychological outcomes were analysed using a mixed model adjusted for
course (random), centre, baseline HbA1c, and baseline score, with the exception of
the diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire, which we compared between groups
using a non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test. No adjustments for multiple
testing were made to the significance level for all exploratory secondary
objectives.

A retrospective subgroup analysis used mixed effects regression modelling with the
primary outcome, change in HbA1c (%), including main effects of treatment group and
subgroup, an interaction term between treatment and subgroup, and covariates of
centre (fixed effect) and course (random effect). All categories for the subgroup
analysis were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan but not in the original
protocol, and are reported in full.

Patient involvement
Fifteen people, who had previously attended DAFNE courses (including pilot courses on
pump treatment) but were not participating in the trial, were recruited to act as a
user group and contribute to different aspects of the work. We invited two members to
join both the steering group and the other investigator meetings. In addition, one of
the project team (a doctor) is a pump user. They provided input to the trial design,
implementation, and dissemination, including all participant materials. This included
a discussion of the most appropriate research questions and whether individuals who
were willing to try pump treatment could be successfully recruited into a trial where
they could be randomised to multiple daily injections.

Results
Study participants
Participants were recruited between November 2011 and April 2013. Follow-up continued
until June 2015. The CONSORT flowchart (fig 1) shows
the flow of patients through the trial. Forty six courses were randomised. Of the 317
participants included in the randomisation, 50 were excluded from any analysis; 40
withdrew before giving baseline data and 10 before their course. All randomised
courses were delivered. Of 267 participants randomised and attending the baseline
assessment and the course, 260 (pump=132; injections=128) made up the intention to
treat set. Two hundred and forty eight participants had complete primary outcome data
at 24 months.

Table 1 shows the baseline demographics and
characteristics of the trial population stratified by treatment received. Baseline
data were well balanced between treatment groups, with the exception of slightly
higher baseline HbA1c in the pump group (9.3% v 9.0%). Just 9% had a
baseline HbA1c <7.5%.

Primary outcomes
HbA1c
At 24 months in participants whose baseline HbA1c was ≥7.5% (n=119 in pump group;
n=116 in multiple daily injections group) the mean change in the pump group was a
decrease of 0.85% (9.3 mmol/mol) compared with 0.42% (4.5 mmol/mol) in the
multiple daily injections group. After adjusting for centre, course, and baseline
HbA1c, the mean difference in HbA1c change from baseline was −0.24% (95%
confidence interval −0.53% to 0.05%) (−2.7 mmol/mol, −5.8 to 0.5) in favour of
pump treatment (P=0.10). The treatment difference was larger for the per protocol
analysis; mean difference −0.36% (−0.64% to −0.07%) (−3.9 mmol/mol, −7.0 to −0.8)
in favour of pump treatment (P=0.02), although this point estimate was still
smaller than the prespecified minimal clinically important difference. Estimate of
the intraclass correlation coefficient was approximately 0.5%.

At 24 months, for the treatment groups combined (n=248), in all participants with
complete HbA1c data there was a decrease of 0.54% (95% confidence interval 0.38%
to 0.69%) (5.9 mmol/mol, 4.2 to 7.6) and for participants with baseline HbA1c
≥7.5% (n=224) the decrease was slightly greater, at 0.64% (95% confidence interval
0.48% to 0.80%) (7 mmol/mol, 5.2 to 8.8).

Proportion of participants reaching HbA1c ≤7.5% (58 mmol/mol)
The proportions of participants reaching an HbA1c ≤7.5% (58 mmol/mol) after two
years, regardless of baseline HbA1c value, were 25.0% for the pump group and 23.3%
for the multiple daily injections group (odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval
0.62 to 2.39, P=0.57, table 2). The results
were similar at six and 12 months.

The primary analysis at 24 months was repeated for six and 12 month follow-up
visits (table 3). The results for these interim
time points were consistent with the primary outcome analysis. The largest
difference in HbA1c change from baseline was observed at six months, with an
adjusted mean difference of −0.25% (95% confidence interval −0.52% to 0.02%) (−2.7
mmol/mol, −5.6 to 0.2), P=0.07. Figure 2 displays the change in HbA1c for
participants with data at all four time points by treatment group.

Secondary outcomes
Hypoglycaemia
Relatively few severe hypoglycaemic episodes were observed post-baseline: 49 in 25
participants. The rate of severe hypoglycaemia during the 24 month follow-up did
not differ between the treatment groups, adjusted for centre, course, baseline
HbA1c, and presence of at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode in the 12 months
before baseline (incidence rate ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 2.51,
P=0.77).

Across both treatment groups, the number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was
reduced. The average number of episodes for each patient per year in the study
reduced from 0.17 before baseline to 0.10 during follow-up. The incidence rate
ratio for the number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes in the 24 month follow-up,
compared with the year before baseline, was 0.46 (0.24 to 0.89, P=0.02).

Across both treatment arms, on average, three moderate hypoglycaemic episodes were
recorded for each patient over a four week history at six months. By 24 months
this number was slightly lower (2.6 for pump group, 2.3 for multiple daily
injections group) but there was no statistically significant difference between
the groups in rates of moderate hypoglycaemic episodes at any time point.

Other biomedical outcomes
Body weight remained roughly constant throughout the study period, and was not
statistically significantly different between the treatment groups at any time
point (table 4). A slight increase in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol and a slight decrease in total cholesterol levels
were observed in both groups, with no evidence of a difference between treatment
groups in change from baseline (P values ranged from 0.22 to 0.86). Insulin dose
decreased in both arms. At 12 months, participants in the pump group had a 0.07
IU/kg greater reduction in insulin dose than those in the multiple daily
injections group (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.13 decrease, P=0.02). The
difference was slightly smaller at six and 24 months and was not statistically
significant. There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of
proteinuria between the treatment groups at any time point (table 5).

Diabetic ketoacidosis
The number or type of serious adverse events did not differ between the groups,
with the exception of diabetic ketoacidosis, which was greater in the pump group
compared with multiple daily injections group (17 v 5). More
patients using pumps than using multiple daily injections had several episodes (5
v 2) and the differences were confined to the first year, with
four episodes in each group during the second year. Three episodes occurred in two
participants who switched to pump treatment, and one in a participant who switched
to multiple daily injections. Most episodes of ketoacidosis were caused by
infections and 18% by set failure in those using pumps. Only five episodes
occurred when participants implemented all sick day rules.

Ancillary outcomes
High levels of completion of the psychosocial questionnaires were observed across
all questionnaires and time points (around 90% completed at each time point). The
completion rate was slightly higher for participants allocated to the pump
compared with multiple daily injections, which reflects the relative dropout rates
in the two groups. No between group differences were found in the generic quality
of life and health status instruments SF-12, WHOQOL-BREF, and EQ-5D, and the HADs
score for depression and anxiety at six, 12, and 24 months (tables 6-8).

The overall diabetes specific quality of life (DSQOL) (on a 100 point scale)
showed that both groups improved at 24 months, by a mean of 8.2 (SD 13.1) points
in the pump group and 4.2 (SD 13.2) points in the multiple daily injections group.
Both groups showed improvements in the DSQOL subdomains, which were greater in the
pump group although not always reaching statistical significance.

The improvement in DSQOL diet restrictions was larger for the pump group compared
with multiple daily injections group at both 12 and 24 months (12 month adjusted
mean difference in change from baseline −4.1 (95% confidence interval −7.2 to
−1.0, P=0.01); 24 month adjusted mean difference in change from baseline −5.1
(−8.6 to −1.6, P=0.004); lower scores represent better outcomes. The pump group
also had greater improvement in DSQOL daily hassle or functions at both 12 and 24
months; at 24 months the score had decreased by 10 points in the pump group,
compared with 4 points in the multiple daily injections group (adjusted mean
difference −6.3, −10.9 to −1.8, P=0.01).

Participants in the pump group had better improvement in treatment satisfaction at
all time points (table 9) but the difference
was statistically significant at 12 and 24 months only (P=0.07 at six months,
P<0.001 at 12 and 24 months).

Retrospective analyses
Participants achieving the updated NICE recommendation of HbA1c ≤6.5%
A retrospective analysis showed that eight (3%) of all participants (4/128 pump
group and 4/120 multiple daily injections group) reached an HbA1c of ≤6.5% (47
mmol/mol) after two years (table 10). Of
these, two participants (both in the pump group) experienced one or more episodes
of severe hypoglycaemia during follow-up.

Table 10 Number and proportion of participants achieving new National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence HbA1c recommendation of ≤6.5% at six, 12, and 24
months

12
months	3/126 (2.4)	3/120 (2.5)	
24
months	4/128 (3.1)	4/120 (3.3)	
Number of participants achieving ≤6.5% is small and hence statistical models
to estimate difference in proportions and confidence intervals failed to
converge.

Participant contacts
A retrospective analysis showed that, on average, those allocated to pumps had
around double the number of contacts with professionals for diabetes between
baseline and the end of year 1, both face to face and by telephone. Between months
12 and 24, those using pumps had more face-to-face contacts, which were of longer
duration (mean 1.6 v 1.3 contacts), but fewer telephone contacts
(0.7 v 1.2).

Blood glucose testing
A retrospective analysis indicated that there was no difference in the mean
frequency of blood glucose testing between treatment groups at 24 months after
adjustment for baseline number of blood glucose tests, centre, and DAFNE course.
The adjusted mean difference in blood glucose tests was 0.22 (95% confidence
interval −0.24 to 0.68) per day or 3.1 (−3.4 to 9.6) over two weeks; P=0.35.
Overall, the number of blood glucose tests increased from 3.6 per day at baseline
to 4.1 per day at 24 months (95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.82,
P<0.001).

Subgroup analysis
A retrospective analysis found no reliable statistical evidence of any subgroup
effects or interactions between group (figs 3 and
4). However, there was some indication that
participants with qualifications up to A level or equivalent did better in the
pump group than in the multiple daily injections group (mean difference in HbA1c
change (%) at 24 months −0.7% (95% confidence interval −1.2% to −0.1%) (−7.4
mmol/mol, 95% confidence interval −13.2 to −1.5)), although the interaction test
was not statistically significant (P=0.07).

Discussion
In a group of adults with type 1 diabetes referred for structured training in flexible
insulin treatment because of suboptimal diabetes control, participation in the REPOSE
trial achieved a clinically worthwhile decrease in HbA1c of 0.6% (7 mmol/mol) at two
years in those with a baseline HbA1c of >7.5%. However, in terms of the primary
outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences in change from baseline to
24 months between those randomised to pump treatment or those using multiple daily
injections, nor in the proportion of participants reaching an HbA1c of ≤7.5%, indicating
that pump treatment provided no clear biomedical benefit over training in DAFNE
skills.

Rates of severe hypoglycaemia were halved in both groups (despite lower HbA1c values), a
benefit maintained to 24 months with no difference between the groups in this or in
rates of moderate hypoglycaemia. There were no other differences in biomedical outcomes
apart from slightly greater reductions in insulin doses in those randomised to pump
treatment. Both groups showed improved satisfaction with treatment and diabetes specific
quality of life. Treatment satisfaction and two subdomains of the diabetes specific
quality of life scale improved to a greater extent at two years in those allocated to
pump treatment.

Strengths and limitations of this study
Compared with previous trials of pump treatment our study had a robust, multisite
design, involved much larger numbers, and had a clinically meaningful period of
follow-up pump treatment. Participants in both groups used analogue insulins and
bolus calculators. The study was conducted in experienced secondary care centres and
involved attendance at a structured education intervention that is well established
across the UK. It included a comprehensive psychological evaluation with high levels
of data completeness. The pragmatic study design thus provides good external
validity, particularly as participating in the educational course led to sustained
improvements in glycaemic control and reduced rates of severe hypoglycaemia.

It is not possible to blind a trial where insulin delivery systems are fundamentally
different and this imposes limitations on any randomised controlled trial involving
pumps. However, for the primary outcomes, HbA1c was objectively assessed using a
central laboratory.17 A trial studying
people who have expressed a desire for pump treatment is likely to struggle to
recruit participants if one arm continues to use multiple daily injections. Those
randomised to the injections arm might also either drop out or exhibit poor outcomes
because of “disappointment” and lack of motivation. We recruited individuals who had
not specifically requested pump treatment but were awaiting a course in diabetes self
management to help them improve their metabolic control. Thus, our aim was to
determine any added benefit of pumps over multiple daily injections while controlling
for the training itself.

A potential limitation is that those randomised to pump treatment might have been
insufficiently motivated to make the most of any technological benefit since they had
not expressed a particular wish to use a pump. A common reason given by patients for
not wanting to participate in REPOSE was reluctance to use an insulin pump. However,
educators encouraged participants to use additional technological pump features (eg
using more sophisticated bolus delivery) and provided extra input when this training
was requested. Overall, we reasoned that since participants had signed up for a
course to improve their glucose control, any added benefits of pump treatment would
emerge.

In this pragmatic trial we did not collect detailed information about pump basal
rates, how often patients adjusted and tested these, and time spent with pump
participants. Our study was not designed to establish which features of pumps
determine success in lowering HbA1c values in those doing “well” with pump treatment.
An explanatory trial would have required a different study design. We therefore
cannot be sure why those allocated to pump treatment failed to show a greater
decrease in HbA1c.

We recorded the average number of blood glucose tests each day in both groups over
the previous two weeks, both at baseline and at 24 months. Both groups had increased
the number of daily tests from 3.6 before training to more than four each day at 24
months, but this did not differ between the groups. Perhaps this frequency of testing
reflects a level of engagement in self management that was insufficient for
participants in the pump group to take full advantage of the technology. One
interpretation was that the educators were unable to provide adequate training in use
of the pump during the one week course. However, it is just as likely that provision
of pump treatment in a group of patients who had not been previously trained in
delivery of flexible intensive insulin treatment included many who subsequently found
it too challenging to implement and maintain the intensity of self management that
both pump treatment and multiple daily injections demand.

Comparison with other trials
Two appraisals of pumps by NICE have reviewed the evidence on clinical and cost
effectiveness. One18 noted that there were
no trials of pumps against “best multiple daily injections” with long acting and
short acting analogue insulins; that some trials had unequal amounts of education in
the arms (with more in the pump arms); and that the trials had focused on easily
measurable outcomes such as HbA1c, rather than on benefits in terms of flexibility of
lifestyle and quality of life. The report recommended trials of pumps against
analogue based multiple daily injections. A more recent report19 found only three trials in adults, one a pilot and the other
involving 39 adults with type 1 diabetes, already using pump treatment who were
randomised to continue with the pump or to switch to glargine based multiple daily
injections. Patients received four months treatment with each. A third trial
recruited 57 adults randomised to pump or analogue injections in an equivalence
study. None showed any difference in HbA1c. Thus, the evidence base from trials for
comparing pumps and “best multiple daily injections” was weak in terms of numbers,
with a total of only 103 patients and short follow-up.

The assessment for the second appraisal19
reviewed observational studies of adults switching to pumps for clinical indications.
These have the advantage of measuring change in glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia
in those who have most to gain, and these studies showed improved HbA1c of the order
of around 0.5%. Bias in observational studies is more of a problem, and results must
be treated with caution. Furthermore, of 48 observational studies, only nine reported
quality of life. Study numbers were small, with at most 35 patients. Duration was
usually short. The longest study noted that initial benefits from pump treatment
might not be sustained. The present study has thus addressed several of these
concerns with large numbers in an adequately powered trial and a virtually complete
dataset for both biomedical and psychological outcomes.

Clinical and policy implications
Our study suggests that extending the availability of pumps to adults with type
1diabetes with suboptimal glycaemic control and no desire to use this form of insulin
delivery is unlikely to result in either lower levels of glycaemia as measured by
HbA1c or lower rates of hypoglycaemia. The absence of a control arm in which
structured training was not provided, means we cannot be certain that participation
in training explains the considerable decreases in HbA1c and severe hypoglycaemia in
both groups. Yet, it seems unlikely that mere trial participation led to sustained
decreases in HbA1c and severe hypoglycaemia for up to two years, particularly as
allocation to such a control arm, in previous trials involving the DAFNE
intervention, showed no effect on HbA1c.2

The results would appear to support the current clinical pathway as proposed by NICE,
in which people desiring improved diabetes control undergo structured training in
flexible insulin treatment with multiple daily injections alone. The trial outcomes,
together with the review for NICE of observational pump studies, suggest that pumps
might usefully be reserved to support those who actively engage in self management
after structured education. Those who find that despite their best efforts,
injections fail to deliver the expected benefits could then be offered the additional
technological advantages of an insulin pump.

Clearly some patients improved more than others in terms of glucose control or
hypoglycaemia and we explored whether there were any demographic differences in those
who did particularly well. There was no reliable evidence of any plausible subgroup
effects or interactions between the pump and multiple daily injections group, and the
baseline characteristics of those whose glycaemic control changed to <7.5% during
the trial were no different from the pump population as a whole. We observed modest
centre effects but no systematic differences according to greater experience in pump
treatment.

Those using insulin pumps did show some quality of life benefits, reporting less
restriction in diet and daily hassles in the DSQOL scale and greater treatment
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the differences were modest and observed in comparison
with a group given no novel technology. Since they were not associated with other
positive treatment outcomes, those observations are probably insufficient to justify
a major alteration in guidelines for the use of pumps.

One of the more striking results of this trial was the generally high level of HbA1c
among adults in the UK enrolling for self management training in flexible insulin
treatment. Participation in the courses produced important and sustained decreases,
but for most participants still fell well short of the target recommended by NICE,
recently reduced from 7.5% to 6.5%.20 The
high levels of HbA1c among people with type 1 diabetes in UK centres compared with
most other European countries have also been noted in a recent study.21 There is an urgent need to explore the
barriers to successful self management in adults with type 1 diabetes in the UK and
to understand why referral for appropriate training is often left so long. This was
also the conclusion of our recently completed research programme.15 Our results suggest that these problems
cannot be overcome merely by providing additional technology in the form of
pumps.

Conclusions
People with type 1 diabetes might be better served by ensuring far greater
availability of high quality, structured self management training, which is currently
only accessed by around 10% of adults in the UK.22 Participants might only recognise the limitations of insulin delivery
by multiple daily injections if they start actively managing their diabetes after
training. Those individuals could then be offered pump treatment to help them reach
the stringent glucose targets necessary to achieve an HbA1c of 6.5% or to overcome
problematic hypoglycaemia.

What is already known on this topic
Assessments of insulin pump treatment in type 1 diabetes concluded that
it was worthwhile for those who were otherwise unable to achieve good
glycaemic control without disabling hypoglycaemia

The case for wider use is uncertain, given the small size and short
duration of trials of pumps versus modern multiple daily injections, and
the need to distinguish the effects of the pump and the extra education
provided

What this study adds
The REPOSE trial randomised patients to pump or multiple daily
injections, with both groups receiving similar structured education;
HbA1c levels and rates of severe hypoglycaemia decreased in both groups,
slightly more in the pump group, but without statistical significance

Both groups showed improved quality of life benefits, but those using
pumps showed additional albeit modest benefits in quality of life,
reported fewer restrictions in diet and daily hassles in the diabetes
specific quality of life scale, and greater treatment satisfaction

Although participation in the courses produced sustained improvement,
levels of glucose control remained far short of those currently
recommended by NICE
