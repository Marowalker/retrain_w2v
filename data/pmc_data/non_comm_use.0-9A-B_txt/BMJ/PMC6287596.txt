==== Body
Over four decades ago, Klatsky and his colleagues published perhaps the first carefully
conducted epidemiological investigation of alcohol consumption and risk of myocardial
infarction,1 a case-control study nested within
the health records of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California. Taking advantage of
some 120 000 health plan members who completed a standardized set of over 500 individual
questions, the authors identified 464 members who sustained an incident myocardial
infarction at local Kaiser hospitals. They compared the alcohol consumption reported on a
previous questionnaire among these members with that of two sets of controls drawn from the
same source population. Among non-smokers, the odds of myocardial infarction were about
twice as high among non-drinkers as among drinkers, raising the possibility that alcohol
consumption could lower risk of coronary heart disease.1


In subsequent analyses of members of the Kaiser-Permanente health maintenance organization,
Klatsky and colleagues went on to show that alcohol consumption has diverse associations
with various forms of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including a roughly
inverse association with coronary heart disease, a U shaped association with ischemic
stroke, and roughly direct associations with hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke.2

In a linked article, Bell and colleagues have now extended Klatsky’s work in two directions
(doi:10.1136/bmj.j909).6 In a
retrospective cohort study of about two million adults seen in general practices throughout
England, they linked alcohol information coded by treating clinicians in the Clinical
Practice Research Datalink with cardiovascular outcomes identified in a series of British
health registers to ascertain the dose-response relations between alcohol consumption and
first incidence of several cardiovascular conditions. This large scale effort extends the
topic, both in its use of clinical records to assess alcohol consumption and in the
multiplicity of outcomes that can be assessed.

The first leap forward is the estimation of a patient’s actual alcohol consumption (in five
categories) from clinical data, rather than from structured assessment tools like those
applied in Kaiser-Permanente. Unfortunately, as the authors’ examples illustrate, this
requires creative extrapolation and will not be easy to export to settings outside the UK.
The passive approach, however, enables studies of massive sample size. While it also
introduces both random and systematic measurement error, the large sample can overcome
random misclassification of alcohol consumption, albeit at the cost of hazard ratios that
could be underestimated in magnitude. Systematic error is more pernicious and contributed
to both by intentional under-reporting by patients and by difficult choices forced by
imperfect clinical information. For example, patients found to have alcohol on their breath
by a general practitioner were classified as “moderate drinkers,” but without formal
validation, this categorization seems uncertain at best. Equally problematic are missing
data. In this study, information on alcohol consumption was missing in 43% of the overall
sample, with the potential for bias in any direction.

The second step forward, which draws directly on the first, is the panoply of outcomes that
can be assessed with so large a sample size. Bell and colleagues examined a diverse, if
quizzical, set of endpoints that would be difficult to study with precision in smaller
cohorts.6 They largely reproduce previous
findings from the Kaiser-Permanente studies but add risk estimates for subtypes of
myocardial infarction, stable and unstable angina, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, among
others. Clearly, this approach is particularly attractive for rarer health outcomes,
although these tend to be least important for overall public health.

This work by Bell and colleagues fits into a burgeoning new generation of studies that
propose to adapt classic cohort designs to general practice settings by using data
collected in electronic health records and large registries. These studies, which rely on
advances in the information technology infrastructure embedded in healthcare settings,
represent a promising convergence between medicine, public health, and research. As
epidemiologists identify social and behavioral factors that determine health in
populations, individual clinicians and healthcare systems will need to incorporate those
factors into the care of specific patients and thus into patients’ electronic health
records. These records can, in turn, be used to conduct a new round of further studies in a
feed forward cycle.7


The new study does not offer a materially new view of the associations between alcohol
consumed within recommended limits and risk of cardiovascular disease. They report lower
rates of essentially every meaningful cardiovascular outcome except hemorrhagic stroke
among moderate drinkers than among abstainers. Four decades of epidemiological studies have
largely found the same. This work, however, sets the stage for ever larger and more
sophisticated studies that will attempt to harness the flood of big data into a stream of
useful, reliable, and unbiased findings that can inform public health, clinical care, and
the direction of future research.
