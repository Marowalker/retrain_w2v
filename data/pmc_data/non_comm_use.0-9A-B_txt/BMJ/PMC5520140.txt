==== Body
The authorship of this paper â€‰(BMJ 2017;356;j100, doi:10.1136/bmj.j1000, published 16 March 2017) has been amended to group authorship. All members of the group listed at the end of the article were full authors and fulfilled ICMJE criteria for authorship. In addition, the paper incorrectly stated that the CGPS, GESUS, DESIR, DCH Study, DIOGENES, PREDIMED-VALENCIA, and BPRHS cohorts were part of the CHARGE consortium. There were also some errors in the consortium names in the figures, which have also been corrected. In figure 1 Nutrition and Health of Ageing Population in China should have been called the Chinese cohort, the PREDIMED study should have been PREDIMED-VALENCIA, and the Family Health Study should have been Family Heart Study (FamHS). In figure 2 and 4 the Malmo study should be MDCS, FHS should be FamHS, PREDIMED should be PREDIMED-VALENCIA, and INCH should be InCHIANTI. In figure 3 the sixth study should be Drouin-Chartier (2014) and the final study should be Drouin-Chartier (2015). In figures 5 and 6, the Family Health Study should be FamHS, the PREDIMED study should be PREDIMED-VALENCIA, and Boston should be BPRHS. Full names for all the studies are available in the web appendix.
