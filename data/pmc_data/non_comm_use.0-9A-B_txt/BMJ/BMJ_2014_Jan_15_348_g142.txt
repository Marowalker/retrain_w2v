The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration performed a rigorous and insightful analysis of the impact of antihypertensive agents on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.1 However, we believe the study’s conclusion that “there is little evidence to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of cardiovascular events in people with chronic kidney disease” should be treated with caution. Although results from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension do not conflict with this conclusion,2 ALLHAT and other trials indicate that the choice of antihypertensive agent does matter in black patients.3

For example, in ALLHAT, black patients treated with lisinopril rather than chlortalidone were more likely to experience stroke (P<0.001) and combined cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, coronary revascularisation, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease; P<0.001). These findings persisted after time dependent adjustment for blood pressure but were absent in non-black patients. Moreover, the risk of incremental harms from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in black patients is also supported by a systematic review of randomised trials.4

Because hypertension related morbidity and mortality are higher in black patients than in other racial and ethnic groups,5 it would have been useful if the collaboration’s study had included a subgroup analysis of black versus non-black patients. Perhaps such analyses should be the rule rather than the exception in studies of hypertension when feasible. Use of the collaboration’s data to assess whether the study’s conclusion about choice of drug class is applicable to black people would be of great value to clinicians and the millions of black patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.
