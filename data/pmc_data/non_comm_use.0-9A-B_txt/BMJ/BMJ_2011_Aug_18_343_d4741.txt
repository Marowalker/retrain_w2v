                    parent-toddler language promotion programme delivered to toddlers identified as
                    slow to talk on screening in universal services.

Design Cluster randomised trial nested in a population based
                    survey.

Setting Three local government areas in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants Parents attending 12 month well child checks over a six
                    month period completed a baseline questionnaire. At 18 months, children at or
                    below the 20th centile on an expressive vocabulary checklist entered the
                    trial.

Intervention Maternal and child health centres (clusters) were
                    randomly allocated to intervention (modified “You Make the Difference” programme
                    over six weekly sessions) or control (“usual care”) arms.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome was expressive language
                    (Preschool Language Scale-4) at 2 and 3 years; secondary outcomes were receptive
                    language at 2 and 3 years, vocabulary checklist raw score at 2 and 3 years,
                    Expressive Vocabulary Test at 3 years, and Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 raw
                    score at 2 and 3 years.

Results 1217 parents completed the baseline survey; 1138 (93.5%)
                    completed the 18 month checklist, when 301 (26.4%) children had vocabulary
                    scores at or below the 20th centile and were randomised (158 intervention, 143
                    control). 115 (73%) intervention parents attended at least one session (mean 4.5
                    sessions), and most reported high satisfaction with the programme. Interim
                    outcomes at age 2 years were similar in the two groups. Similarly, at age 3
                    years, adjusted mean differences (intervention−control) were −2.4 (95%
                    confidence interval −6.2 to 1.4; P=0.21) for expressive language; −0.3 (−4.2 to
                    3.7; P=0.90) for receptive language; 4.1 (−2.3 to 10.6; P=0.21) for vocabulary
                    checklist; −0.5 (−4.4 to 3.4; P=0.80) for Expressive Vocabulary Test; −0.1 (−1.6
                    to 1.4; P=0.86) for externalising behaviour problems; and −0.1 (−1.3 to 1.2;
                    P=0. 92) for internalising behaviour problems.

Conclusion This community based programme targeting slow to talk
                    toddlers was feasible and acceptable, but little evidence was found that it
                    improved language or behaviour either immediately or at age 3 years.

Introduction
Approximately 5-8% of preschool children have a delay in their language development
                that persists throughout the school years and into adulthood.1
                2
                3
                4
                5 Persistent language delay is associated
                with poorer school and academic performance, more limited employment opportunities,
                and difficulties with social interactions and relationships.2
                3 Higher rates of behavioural problems may
                compound poorer educational, social, and employment outcomes.2
                4
                6

One important risk factor for early language delay is a restricted size of expressive
                vocabulary at 18-24 months of age,7
                typically assessed using standardised parental report instruments that are
                inexpensive and reliable and predict later language outcomes.7
                8
                9
                10 Theoretical views of language
                acquisition consider that development of vocabulary provides a foundation for future
                grammatical development.11 Delays in
                expressive vocabulary, in the absence of neurological, sensory, or cognitive
                deficits, affect approximately 15-20% of 2 year olds.12
                13 Untreated delays in toddlers have
                persistence rates of 40-60%,5 and limited
                evidence suggests that earlier detection may lead to more timely access to speech
                and language services and fewer children needing specialised interventions at school
                    age.14
                15

Early preventive interventions have the potential to allay parental concerns, improve
                children’s language outcomes, and subsequently expedite entry into more intensive
                services for those most in need. A relatively low cost option is to teach parents to
                optimise their responsive behaviours (for example, responding to the child’s focus
                of interest) and provide rich language input (for example, expanding the child’s
                attempts to talk).16
                17
                18 Parent based programmes have been
                reported to improve the short term language outcomes of children at risk and to
                reduce delays in expressive vocabulary development.16
                17
                18
                19 A recent meta-analysis of intervention
                trials showed much larger effect sizes for younger children with language delay
                (aged approximately 2 years) than for older children.20 Language intervention may also improve behaviour and
                    socialisation.17
                21

In 2006 the US Preventive Services Task Force released its systematic review of
                evidence for screening for speech and language delay in preschool children.5 It called for larger studies (>50 in each
                arm), longer term follow-up (at least 12 months), studies in children aged under 2
                years, and consideration of “the balance of benefits and harms of using brief,
                formal screening instruments . . . for . . . language delay in the primary care
                setting.” The trial reported here was planned to consider each of these factors and,
                specifically, an evidence gap for population based selective prevention. Selective
                prevention involves offering a low intensity intervention to a relatively large
                minority of the population with an identified strong risk factor, rather than to the
                smaller group that might meet diagnostic criteria if detailed assessment were
                available.

We report the outcomes in 2 year olds and 3 year olds of a parent based language
                promotion programme in Melbourne, Australia, that targets 18 month old toddlers at
                risk of language delay by virtue of the absence or near absence of spoken words. We
                chose this entry point because we wanted to offer a true selective prevention
                (rather than early treatment) intervention; our universal services have very high
                capture rates at this age; parents are typically very concerned about absence of
                language at 18 months and so would be very motivated to participate; the programme
                would not be stigmatising, because of its overtly preventive nature and the fact
                that 20% of all children would be involved; and, if the programme was rolled out in
                Australia, the upcoming 2 year old well child visit (the last until age 3.5 years)
                could act as a funnel into more detailed assessment and individual referral for
                those who did not seem to benefit from the preventive programme.

The Hanen Centre developed the preventive programme “You Make the Difference”, a
                parent-toddler language promotion programme.22 It has been previously pilot tested with parents of at risk
                    toddlers,23
                24 showing a high degree of parental
                satisfaction with the programme’s format, content, and outcomes. We aimed to
                determine whether translating the programme to a low intensity population based
                screening approach delivered to all toddlers with slow early development of
                expressive vocabulary would improve children’s language development outcomes at 2
                and 3 years (the primary outcome) and reduce behavioural problems (particularly
                externalising ones).

Methods
Study design
This cluster randomised trial was nested within a population survey in three of
                    the 31 local government areas comprising greater Melbourne (population 3 592 591
                    in 2006), Australia. The three areas comprise a diverse population including
                    areas of lower (Frankston), middle (Banyule), and upper (Kingston) socioeconomic
                    status as measured by the Australian census derived Socio-Economic Indexes For
                    Areas (SEIFA) Index of Disadvantage.25
                    The survey and trial were informed by a pilot randomised trial
                        (ISRCTN45091963).24

Participants
All newborn infants in Melbourne are allocated to a local maternal and child
                    health nurse who provides developmental care to age 5 years. Nurses
                    pre-identified all infants born in May-October 2006 (Banyule, Kingston) or
                    June-December 2006 (Frankston) and, at their 12 month visit (or by mail if they
                    did not attend), ascertained interest in the trial. Children were excluded if
                    they had already been referred for cognitive delay, major medical conditions, or
                    suspected autism spectrum disorder or if parents had insufficient English to
                    complete the questionnaires (written at a year 6 level of English) or
                    participate in the programme. The research team then contacted interested
                    families and mailed baseline questionnaires and written informed consent forms.
                    Parents consented simultaneously to the baseline survey and entry into the trial
                    if subsequently eligible, enabling us to determine the true uptake of the
                    intervention.

At 18 months, the research team mailed recruited parents the screening expressive
                    vocabulary and behaviour checklists. We determined eligibility for the trial by
                    a score at or below the 20th centile on the expressive vocabulary checklist,
                    based on population norms.26

Randomisation and blinding
Once recruitment was complete, we stratified maternal and child health centres
                    (clusters) by local government area and randomly allocated them to intervention
                    or “usual care”’ (control) arms by using block randomisation with fixed block
                    sizes of two after rank ordering the centres by the number of eligible children.
                    A statistician not involved in enrolment computer generated the concealed
                    allocation sequence, and the researchers who did outcome assessments were
                    blinded to group allocation. Participants could not be blinded to group
                    membership.

Intervention
The programme was a modified version of “You Make the Difference”22 that was shortened from nine to six
                    weekly sessions and supported by resources (guidebook, videotapes) for parents
                    and training workshops for programme leaders. It promoted child centred,
                    interaction promoting, and language modelling responsive interaction strategies;
                    the intervention, its supporting theory, and its implementation are detailed in
                    our report of the Let’s Learn Language pilot study.24 Figure 1 summarises
                    the content of the sessions. Over six weeks, weekly two hour sessions were held
                    in the morning at a local community centre with child care available. In total,
                    20 programmes were offered; each included three to eight children and was led by
                    one of three interventionists (one with a speech pathology background and two
                    with psychology backgrounds) who had attended a three day Hanen training
                    programme followed by specific training in the modified version.

Fig 1 Pictorial diagram42 of Let’s Learn Language survey and randomised trial

The format is described in detail elsewhere.22 In brief, parents attended the first 1.5 hours while children
                    were supervised in an adjacent room. In each session, the group leader started
                    by reviewing the previous week’s home practice and showing video clips of
                    parent-child interactions to highlight previously learnt strategies; this was
                    followed by a participative lecture. In the last 30 minutes, each parent and
                    child pair was videotaped practising the new strategies with coaching as needed,
                    from which a short positive clip was drawn for the group to view the following
                    week to reinforce specific strategies.

Baseline measures
At age 12 months (May-December 2007), parents reported demographic data and
                    completed the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile:
                    Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS DP).27
                    At 18 months, parents completed the 100 word Sure Start expressive vocabulary
                    screening measure,26 adapted from the
                    MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory: UK Short Form,11 and further adapted by substituting
                    two words for the Australian setting (cream cracker to cracker; settee/sofa to
                    settee/sofa/couch). Our inclusion criterion cut-off point of the 20th centile
                    corresponds to no or very limited spoken words. Parents also completed the Child
                    Behavior Checklist (CBCL/1.5-5),28 a 99
                    item parent reported scale that generates scores for internalising and
                    externalising behaviour problem subscales.

Outcome measures
At around age 2 years (12-14 weeks after the programme, May 2008 to February
                    2009), parents again completed the 100 word Sure Start measure and the Child
                    Behavior Checklist. Trained research assistants visited the home to administer
                    the Preschool Language Scale (PLS-4),29
                    a widely used measure that yields norm referenced scores for auditory
                    comprehension (receptive communication) and expressive communication (our
                    primary outcome). At age 3 years (May 2009 to March 2010), parents completed the
                    MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory III (MCDI-III) and Child
                    Behavior Checklist, and research assistants again visited the home to administer
                    the Preschool Language Scale and the Expressive Vocabulary Test. These are both
                    standardised to a normative mean of 100 (SD 15).

Process measures
Group leaders recorded parents’ attendance. Parents in intervention clusters
                    completed a short feedback questionnaire immediately after the final session,
                    covering usefulness of the programme’s format (sharing with other parents,
                    practising strategies with the child, watching video clips, receiving feedback)
                    and perception of changes in parent-child communication using a four point
                    Likert-type scale. We dichotomised the scales into “high” and “low” values.

Sample size
We needed 100 participants and 20 maternal and child health centre clusters (five
                    participants per cluster) in each arm to detect a mean difference of 0.6
                    standard deviations in expressive language with 90% power at the 5% level of
                    significance, allowing for the clustered design and up to 20% attrition. This
                    effect size was conservatively based on Law’s 2004 systematic review of the
                    efficacy of treatment for children with developmental language delay,20 in which the three included studies of
                    parent delivered interventions yielded a pooled effect size of 0.83 (95%
                    confidence interval −0.96 to 2.63) on preschool children’s expressive syntax
                    scores. The intra-cluster correlation coefficient estimate of 0.04 was based on
                    the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the intra-cluster correlation
                    coefficient at the level of the maternal and child health nurse for expressive
                    vocabulary in the Early Language in Victoria Study.12
                    30 We calculated the number of
                    participants needed in each cluster on the basis of the availability of 40 study
                        clusters.31 We aimed to recruit
                    around 1000 babies at 12 months, assuming that 20% would be eligible for the
                    trial at 18 months.

Statistical analysis
Using the intention to treat principle, we compared mean outcome scores between
                    the trial arms by using random effects linear regression models with maximum
                    likelihood estimation to allow for cluster effects.32 Unadjusted analyses were followed by analyses adjusted
                    for sex, exact age at outcome assessment, local government area, three
                    indicators of socioeconomic status (parent’s education level, household income,
                    Socio-Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) disadvantage score of the participant’s
                    home address), the 12 month Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales
                    Developmental Profile score, and the screening vocabulary score at 18 months. We
                    also adjusted analyses of the behaviour outcomes for the corresponding 18 month
                    score. Finally, we did 12 retrospective tests of interaction to explore whether
                    any indication of differential effect of the intervention on any of the three
                    main outcomes (expressive, receptive, and vocabulary scores) existed at each of
                    the two time points (2 and 3 years of age) between the categories of 18 month
                    vocabulary status (≤10th centile v >10th centile) at 18
                    months and mother’s education level (did not complete school v
                    school completion or higher).

Results
Figure 2 summarises the flow of participants through
                the trial. Of the 1414 eligible and contactable children referred to the language
                survey, 1217 (86.1%) were recruited; of these, 1138 (93.5%) completed the 18 month
                vocabulary screen, of whom 301 (26.4%) entered the trial (158 intervention, 143
                control) on the basis of their screening score. In the intervention arm, 115 (73%)
                parents attended at least one session (mean 4.5 (SD 1.6, range 1-6) sessions), and
                90 (57%) parents attended four or more sessions. On average, children with lower
                baseline vocabulary attended more sessions (P=0.03); mean baseline vocabulary scores
                at 18 months were 6.0 (SD 2.9) for those who attended no sessions, 5.5 (2.6) for
                those who attended one to three sessions, and 4.6 (2.9) for those who attended four
                to six sessions.

Retention was high in both arms: 94% (148/158) for the intervention arm and 96%
                (137/143) for the control arm at 2 years and 89% for both the intervention arm
                (140/158) and the control arm (127/143) at 3 years. The assessments for 2 year olds
                took place at a median of 14 (interquartile range 13-16) weeks after the programme.
                Table 1 shows that no marked differences existed
                in baseline characteristics between the trial arms and that their follow-up took
                place at similar ages.

Table 3 shows that between 71 and 88 (76-89%)
                    of the parents rated each aspect of the programme’s instructional format
                    positively. In addition, of the 100 parents asked to give feedback, 86 thought
                    that the programme had led to positive changes in how they communicated with
                    their children, 72 reported positive changes in their children’s communication,
                    and 62 reported changes in their children’s behaviour. Finally, 47 (76% of 62)
                    parents who had other children reported benefits in how they communicated with
                    them.

Missing data
Some participants had data missing for outcomes, confounders, or both, so that
                    the reported analyses did not include all participants. Analyses of 20 imputed
                    complete datasets, generated by using multivariate normal imputation,33 provided results that indicated
                    essentially the same conclusions as the complete case analyses reported
                    here.

Retrospective interaction analyses
We found some evidence at the 5% level of effect modification for three of the 12
                    tests for interaction, pertaining to receptive language scores only. The
                    intervention seemed to be relatively less effective in children with 18 month
                    vocabulary scores at or below the 10th centile (at 2 and 3 years, P=0.004 for
                    both) and in children whose parent did not complete school (at 3 years only,
                    P=0.04).

Discussion
This six week, parent based programme was rated very positively by parents and was
                not harmful. However, we found little evidence that it improved vocabulary,
                language, or behavioural outcomes when delivered as a preventive programme to
                toddlers identified by population based screening as being at risk of language delay
                by virtue of having few or no spoken words at 18 months. The programme would be
                costly to provide at a population level, as it would involve around a quarter of the
                population of toddlers each year. It would also be unnecessary because, although
                these slow to talk toddlers had low mean language scores at age 2, by 3 years they
                had achieved mean expressive, receptive, and vocabulary scores very similar to
                population norms.

Strengths and limitations of study
Strengths of the study include a high population reach and uptake in communities
                    across the demographic spectrum, careful pilot testing of the programme’s
                    protocol to ensure acceptability and feasibility, random allocation to groups,
                    excellent uptake and retention, blinding of outcome assessment, and large sample
                    size (a weakness in the literature for trials of childhood language34). Language outcomes were directly
                    assessed with standardised measures, supplemented by parents’ evaluations and
                    measures of children’s behaviour to investigate the programme’s broader
                    effect.

Several limitations must also be considered. Firstly, although the introduction
                    outlines our good reasons for getting children to enter the trial at 18 months,
                    this may simply be too young; too many children go on to spontaneously develop
                    normal language (that is, the specificity is low). This is supported by the near
                    normal mean language scores (table 2)
                    achieved by age 3 years but was far from evident in the literature when we
                    planned the trial. Perhaps prevention should be earlier and universal, with
                    intervention offered only once language delay is definitely present—that is,
                    only to older children. More recent reports indicate that later screening at 2.5
                    years may yield higher specificity and that interventions targeting 2-3 year old
                    children identified as late talkers can be effective.16
                    17
                    21
                    35 Either way, our findings have
                    implications for policies on whether and when countries screen for language
                    delay, a subject for which stronger evidence is sorely needed.5

Secondly, little is known about the selection of risk factors for language delay.
                    We chose parents’ report of development of expressive vocabulary, on the basis
                    of the best evidence available.7
                    9
                    10 The vocabulary checklist accurately
                    detects toddlers with no or small spoken vocabularies and has been the entry
                    criterion for other trials in this age group,16 although its long term predictive validity has been both
                    criticised and defended.9

                    37 Perhaps 18 months is not too young
                    but, rather, we should have targeted other aspects such as receptive language.
                    However, at age 2, our sample’s mean receptive language score of around 90 was
                    very similar to their low mean expressive language score, with rapid gains in
                    both receptive and expressive scores towards the population mean of 100 by age 3
                    years. Furthermore, as receptive language is by definition less “overt” than
                    spoken language, screening may also be more challenging.

Thirdly, the tests of interaction were not specified in advance, and we had no
                    hypothesis as to what the nature of the interaction might be (which subgroups
                    were most likely to respond differentially to the intervention). As the overall
                    estimated comparison between the trial arms did not indicate an effect, the
                    interaction findings, if true, would suggest benefit for receptive language to
                    one subgroup but harm for the other, which has no strong basis. We take the view
                    that these interaction results are most likely due to chance.

Finally, the intervention may have been insufficiently intensive in uptake,
                    number of sessions received, or dose of intervention per session.38 Although we consider the uptake to be
                    high for a population programme based on screening, only 57% of intervention
                    families participated in at least four of the six weekly sessions; however,
                    retrospective analyses indicate that those most in need (with lower vocabulary
                    scores) were more likely to attend the programme. Even for parents who attended,
                    six weeks may have provided insufficient exposure to consolidate the responsive
                    interaction strategies. Longer interventions over 10-12 weeks have yielded
                    positive outcomes with similar parent based interventions for more highly
                    selected at risk and late talking children16
                    17
                    18; in contrast, low intensity may have
                    explained the limited efficacy in Glogowska’s randomised trial of community
                    based speech and language therapy in older preschool children presenting
                    clinically (whose language did not normalise over the follow-up period).39 However, the normal mean language and
                    vocabulary scores achieved by both intervention and control children by age 3
                    years suggest that natural resolution, rather than our intervention’s intensity
                    being too low, explains the null findings.

Conclusions and policy implications
Studies with both positive and null findings need to be considered in making
                    informed decisions about the effectiveness of prevention strategies,40
                    41 particularly given the public
                    pressure to respond earlier to a range of language concerns in young children.
                    We caution against assuming that good interventions will remain effective when
                    translated to the population level. This study shows the wisdom of doing
                    rigorous trials to avert the considerable waste of governments’ and families’
                    resources that may otherwise occur.

Interventions of greater intensity, delivered at a different age, or both may yet
                    prove helpful, although we recognise that this may put them out of the reach of
                    implementation in the population. Alternatively, efforts may need to focus on
                    improving both the sensitivity and specificity of measures to target
                    interventions better to the young children most at risk of lasting language
                        problems.5 Given the societal cost
                    of these problems, pursuing research into effective prevention and intervention
                    for all these children is essential.

What is already known on this topic
Preschool language delay is associated with poorer school and
                                    academic performance, more limited employment opportunities, and
                                    difficulties with social interactions and relationships

Clinical intervention typically starts late and has limited
                                    effect

Selective prevention could start much earlier and reach more
                                    children, but its benefits are uncertain

What this study adds
Population based screening for slow to talk toddlers followed by
                                    a group language promotion programme for parents was feasible
                                    and acceptable

The programme did not, however, improve language or behaviour
                                    either immediately or at age 3 years and would be costly to
                                    implement for whole populations

The societal cost of language delay makes further rigorous
                                    research into effective prevention and intervention an
                                    imperative
