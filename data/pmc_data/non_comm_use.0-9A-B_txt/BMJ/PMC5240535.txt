The results of the study by Gauffin et al (BMJ 2016;354:i3740, doi:10.1136/bmj.i3740) were incorrectly cited in the discussion section of this paper. It should have said that one study reported 11.6 [not 8] point and 10.6 [not 6] point significantly better outcome from surgery at three and 12 months, respectively, as evaluated using the KOOS subscale for pain.
