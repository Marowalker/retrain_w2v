==== Body
This Research paper contains two errors (BMJ 2015;350:h1798, doi:10.1136/bmj.h1798). The first sentence in the results section of the abstract should have read that 3.2% [not “3.1%”] of 2 266 875 unexposed infants had a birth defect. And the penultimate sentence of the first paragraph of the discussion section should have noted that the adjusted odds ratio in the sibling controlled analysis was 0.56 (0.21 to 1.49), not 0.71 (0.28 to 1.78).
