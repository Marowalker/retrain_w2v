Objective To compare the effectiveness of two types of compression
                    treatment (four layer bandage and short stretch bandage) in people with venous
                    leg ulceration.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of patient level data.

Data sources Electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of
                    Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, Medline,
                    Embase, CINAHL, and National Research Register) and reference lists of retrieved
                    articles searched to identify relevant trials and primary investigators. Primary
                    investigators of eligible trials were invited to contribute raw data for
                    re-analysis.

Review methods Randomised controlled trials of four layer bandage
                    compared with short stretch bandage in people with venous leg ulceration were
                    eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome for the meta-analysis was time to
                    healing. Cox proportional hazards models were run to compare the methods in
                    terms of time to healing with adjustment for independent predictors of healing.
                    Secondary outcomes included incidence and number of adverse events per patient.

Results Seven eligible trials were identified (887 patients), and
                    patient level data were retrieved for five (797 patients, 90% of known
                    randomised patients). The four layer bandage was associated with significantly
                    shorter time to healing: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) from
                    multifactorial model based on five trials was 1.31 (1.09 to 1.58), P=0.005.
                    Larger ulcer area at baseline, more chronic ulceration, and previous ulceration
                    were all independent predictors of delayed healing. Data from two trials showed
                    no evidence of a difference in adverse event profiles between the two bandage
                    types.

Conclusions Venous leg ulcers in patients treated with four layer
                    bandages heal faster, on average, than those of people treated with the short
                    stretch bandage. Benefits were consistent across patients with differing
                    prognostic profiles.

Introduction
Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring chronic wound caused by damage to the
                veins and consequent high venous pressure.1
                The estimated lifetime prevalence for leg ulceration in developed countries is 1%
                and the point prevalence is 0.1-0.2%. Prevalence increases with age and is higher
                among women.2 The UK Healthcare Commission
                has estimated that currently leg ulcer care costs the NHS £300-600m (€330-661m,
                $447-895m) a year.3 A substantial proportion
                of the costs is attributable to nursing time.4
                5 These ulcers are also associated with
                increased costs and reduced health related quality of life for patients.4

Compression bandaging is thought to assist ulcer healing by reducing distension in
                the leg veins and accelerating venous blood flow.1 A previous systematic review of published trial level data concluded that
                compression was more effective in healing venous leg ulcers than no compression,
                multi-layered systems were more effective than single layer systems, and high
                compression was more effective than low compression, but no clear differences in
                effectiveness were detected between different types of high compression.9

The four layer bandage and the short stretch bandage are examples of high compression
                (defined as ankle sub-bandage pressure 35-40 mm Hg). Such systems are deemed to
                deliver the optimum therapeutic effect in eligible patients but are contraindicated
                in people with clinically significant arterial disease. The four layer bandage (an
                elastic system), the standard method in the United Kingdom, comprises orthopaedic
                wool, crepe bandage, elastic bandage, and a final cohesive retaining layer. All
                layers are applied from toes to knee and normally require weekly renewal but can be
                changed more often if necessary. The short stretch system, used as standard
                treatment in mainland Europe and Australia, is an inelastic bandage, meaning that it
                has minimal extensibility (or “give”) when handled. An orthopaedic wool layer is
                covered by the bandage at full stretch to create a rigid casing around the limb that
                generates resistance against calf muscles and other tissues with reapplication every
                few days.1 The short stretch bandage has the
                advantage of being washable and reusable.10
                Findings from a large clinical trial of compression treatment, however, indicated
                that few patients laundered and reused their short stretch bandages.w1
                The four layer bandage, commonly available as a proprietary kit, is designed to be
                discarded after a single use. 

A previous systematic review included two small trials that compared four layer and
                short stretch bandages.w2 w3 At the time of the review, the only
                published trial level data available for both trials were the proportions of ulcers
                healed at three months, suggesting no significant differences between the two
                methods. One of the trials additionally reported healing rates at one year and time
                to healing, with no significant differences observed between bandage
                types.w3 Estimates of the frequency of wound healing at fixed time points
                are less informative than time to healing as the latter has major implications for
                patients’ health related quality of life and use of health service resources. A
                further limitation of the published trial level data was the inability to
                investigate subgroups of patients who might benefit differentially from treatment.
                We therefore carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis based on individual
                patient data to compare the effects of four layer bandage and short stretch bandage
                on time to healing of venous leg ulcers, taking account of prognostic factors. Our
                methods were based on those developed by the Cochrane Individual Patient Data
                Meta-analysis Methods Group.11

Methods
All methods were prespecified in the systematic review and meta-analysis protocol
                (available on request).

Study selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of four layer bandage compared with short stretch
                    bandage for the treatment of venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion.

Identification of trials
 In December 2005 we searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials
                    (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register with no
                    restrictions applied to date, country, or language of publication. To cover the
                    time lag between studies being indexed on primary sources and being listed on
                    the Cochrane databases, we undertook additional searches for Medline, Embase,
                    and CINAHL (2002-5). We searched the National Research Register to identify
                    ongoing trials. All database searches were updated in March 2008. Figure 1 shows
                    the search strategy. Initially, search terms
                    were developed for CENTRAL and were adapted for use in the other databases. We
                    examined the reference lists of eligible trials for additional relevant
                    evaluations and asked collaborating trialists to provide details of any others
                    known to them.

Fig 1 Search strategy used for CENTRAL

Two reviewers (SO’M and NC) independently decided on study selection with
                    disagreements resolved by discussion.

Data collection and end points
Authors of eligible trials were contacted initially during early 2005 and invited
                    to collaborate in the meta-analysis. In cases of non-response, reminder messages
                    were sent, and if necessary these were followed up with postal and telephone
                    correspondence. We eventually established contact with authors of all relevant
                    trials. We asked trialists to provide anonymised baseline and outcome data for
                    each randomised patient, including those excluded from their own analyses, to
                    maintain randomised groups and to provide as complete a dataset as possible for
                    the meta-analysis. Baseline data included sex, age, primary or recurrent
                    ulceration, ulcer duration, ulcer area, ulcer diameter, appearance of wound bed,
                    ulcer infection, ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), ankle circumference,
                    ankle mobility, patient mobility, and history of comorbidities such as deep vein
                    thrombosis. Outcome variables included healing status (that is, healed or not),
                    date of healing, recurrence status, date of recurrence, ulcer area at follow-up
                    points during the trial, and adverse events. In addition, the trialists were
                    asked to provide date of randomisation, allocated treatment, date of last
                    follow-up, and details of exclusion from analysis. All data were systematically
                    checked for completeness, duplication, consistency, feasibility, and integrity
                    of randomisation.11 Queries were
                    resolved by discussion with the relevant trialist. Each included trial was
                    assessed for adequacy of randomised sequence generation, allocation concealment,
                    and blinding with methods based on the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for
                    assessing risk of bias in clinical trials.12

Time to healing was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the
                    date of healing, with healing defined as complete epithelialisation of the
                    reference wound. Wounds were examined at least once a week in all trials. Data
                    for patients with ulcers not healing within the trial period were censored on
                    the date of last follow-up. Time to ulcer recurrence was defined as the time
                    interval between healing and recurrence.

Statistical analysis
The patient was both the sampling unit and the unit of analysis.13 In cases where patients had multiple
                    wounds included in the trial, we selected the largest for inclusion in the
                    meta-analysis. Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat basis (that is,
                    according to randomised allocation group with inclusion of all patients as the
                    aim). Imputation was not undertaken for missing data.

The primary outcome was time to healing. To provide a simple descriptive measure
                    of this outcome, we performed a preliminary (unadjusted) analysis by generating
                    non-stratified Kaplan-Meier survival curves for both treatment groups. The
                    dependent variable was time to healing in days, the event was a healed ulcer,
                    and the factor was bandage type.

Next, we generated a Cox proportional hazards model with time to healing in days
                    as the dependent variable, healing as the event, and bandage type as a
                    covariate. This preliminary model did not include adjustment for baseline
                    characteristics. The main, formal, preplanned analysis entailed a Cox
                    proportional hazards model as described above with additional covariates of sex,
                    age, primary or recurrent ulceration, ulcer duration, ulcer area, ulcer
                    diameter, appearance of wound bed, ulcer infection, ankle brachial pressure
                    index, ankle circumference, ankle mobility, patient’s mobility, and history of
                    comorbidities—for example, deep vein thrombosis. Covariates found to be
                    significant at the 5% level in univariate analyses were entered simultaneously
                    into the model. We then used a backward elimination method to generate hazard
                    ratio estimates of treatment effect. The model was extended to include tests of
                    statistical interaction between type of bandage and baseline characteristics. To
                    take account of any differences in healing rate between study centres, we
                    entered centres into the model as strata. This automatically included trial as
                    strata also as no centre was in more than one trial. To check that stratifying
                    by study centre was the correct approach, we ran two preliminary Cox models
                    including, firstly, bandage type and trial and, secondly, bandage type, trial,
                    and centre as predictors. These models generated identical estimates of
                    treatment effect and so we ran all the above Cox models stratifying only by
                    study centre.

We carried out checks to assess the proportional hazards assumption; the
                    linearity of the relation between the dependent variable and continuous
                    covariates; whether time to healing was similar during early and late
                        accrual14; and adequacy of model
                    fit with regard to the relation between the number of events and the number of
                    covariates included in each model.15

To generate a forest plot showing the relative contribution of each trial to the
                    meta-analysis, we derived individual trial estimates from the individual patient
                    data using Cox regression with covariate adjustment as per the final model as
                    described above. These hazard ratio estimates were then combined to provide a
                    visual display of the overall estimate of treatment effect. This secondary
                    analysis allowed assessment of heterogeneity between trials, defined with the
                        χ2 test (cut off <10% for significance) and the
                    I2 statistic (threshold of >50%).16
                    17

Secondary outcomes included time to ulcer recurrence; change in ulcer area at
                    follow-up points during the trial as a predictor of time to healing; change in
                    ulcer area during the trial as an outcome of treatment; and adverse events. Lack
                    of data for the recurrence and ulcer area outcomes, however, meant that the
                    planned analyses could not be undertaken and so these outcomes are not
                    considered further here.

Adverse events were defined in two ways: as any adverse event or those considered
                    by the original investigators to be related to the bandage. For each of these
                    outcomes, we assessed the effect of bandage type on the incidence of adverse
                    events using the odds ratio with associated 95% confidence intervals. We
                    compared the number of adverse events per patient for the two bandage systems
                    using a weighted mean difference with associated 95% confidence intervals. For
                    all pooled analyses of adverse events, we defined statistical heterogeneity
                    between individual trial estimates using the criteria described above. In the
                    absence of significant heterogeneity, we generated a fixed effect model,
                    otherwise we planned to use a random effects model.

Survival analyses were conducted with SPSS (version 15.0). The Kaplan-Meier plot
                    was generated with Stata SE (version 10). Adverse event analyses and forest
                    plots were generated with RevMan (version 4.2.8).

Results
The search strategy retrieved 128 records of possible relevance. Of these, six trials
                were eligible for inclusion.w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 Four trials were conducted
                in the UKw1 w2 w3 w6 and the two others in mainland Europe.w4
                w5 All trials were individually randomised and recruited participants with
                venous leg ulcers (defined by ankle brachial pressure index ≥0.8 plus clinical
                history). Five trials included two treatment arms and compared the four layer
                bandage with the short stretch bandage.w1 w3 w4 w5 w6 One of these had a
                factorial design and included a randomised comparison of two types of primary
                dressing as well as of the two bandage systems.w6 Another included an
                additional treatment arm that received a two layer paste and support bandage; we
                could not retrieve data for this trial because all records had been
                    destroyed.w2

We identified an additional eligible unpublished trial opportunistically during a
                wound management conference. Contact with the primary investigator confirmed that
                the trial was small (40 patients), had terminated prematurely, and data were no
                longer available. The two trials for which data were unavailable recruited 83
                eligible participants overall (9.4% of known randomised patients). Table 1 shows details of all eligible trials. Table 2 shows patients’ characteristics for the five
                trials with available individual patient data (89.8% of known randomised patients)
                and suggests adequate balance of prognostic factors across treatment groups for the
                meta-analysis dataset.

Information gleaned from correspondence with trialists, trial reports, and the
                individual patient data suggested that all five trials have used adequate methods of
                randomisation and allocation concealment. Three trials used a simple method of
                    randomisation.w4 w5 w6 One of these was unstratified,w5
                and two were stratified by ulcer area.w4 w6 All used sealed envelopes to
                conceal allocation. The fourth trial used blocks of four for randomisation,
                stratified by ulcer area, and concealed allocation by using sealed
                envelopes.w3 The fifth trial used permuted blocks stratified by study
                centre, previous ulceration, ulcer area, and ulcer duration, and concealed
                allocation by using a central telephone randomisation service.w1 Checks
                on the integrity of randomisation carried out on the individual patient data
                suggested that the balance of baseline variables across groups was satisfactory in
                each trial.

All five trials defined healing as complete epithelial cover of the ulcer site with
                non-blinded assessment by clinicians.w1 w3 w4 w5 w6 In the largest trial,
                an investigator blinded to bandage allocation confirmed healing from photographs at
                the trial office; this was considered as an adequate procedure in terms of internal
                    validity.w1

The characteristics of patients included in this meta-analysis seemed generally
                representative of those undergoing management of venous leg ulcers in outpatient or
                community settings.18
                19 The proportions of men and women
                reflected the relevant epidemiological evidence,2 and there was an adequate spread of data for prognostic baseline variables
                such as ulcer area and ulcer duration. The data on ankle mobility and general
                mobility suggested that most patients were ambulant. Reported follow-up periods for
                trials ranged from three to 12 months. The overall median follow-up of patients who
                did not heal during the trial period was around 13 weeks (estimate derived from
                individual patient data).

Data checking procedures showed a low number of errors, such as inconsistent dates,
                unfeasible values, and discrepancies between the individual patient data and the
                published trial report. These were all corrected through discussions with the
                relevant trialists, most being issues that merely required clarification. Ten
                patients were excluded from the original investigators’ own analyses (1.1% of known
                randomised patients), of whom three were reinstated for our meta-analysis (table
                    1). Data for the seven other patients were
                not available from the trialists.

The results of model checking procedures indicated that the proportional hazards
                assumption was upheld for all potentially predictive covariates. The only continuous
                covariate included in the final models—baseline ulcer surface area—was entered as a
                natural log transformation. Outcomes were similar for early and late accruals when
                we took into account differences between study centres in four trials
                    assessed.w1 w4 w5 w6 To assess the adequacy of model fit, we assessed
                the number of events (that is, healings) against the number of covariates entered at
                the start of each model. At least 10 events per variable are required in logistic
                regression to reduce bias in regression coefficients.15 All models generated from the meta-analysis dataset met
                this recommendation.

Time to healing
Preliminary analysis
The median time to healing estimated from unstratified Kaplan-Meier survival
                        analysis of all available patients (n=797) was 90 days for four layer
                        bandage and 99 days for the short stretch bandage (fig 2).

Fig 2 Kaplan-Meier survival curves (unstratified
                                analysis)

Main analysis
An initial Cox proportional hazards model based on all five trials (797
                        patients, 20/797 cases dropped) was generated with time to healing (days) as
                        the dependent variable, healing as the event, study centres as strata, and
                        bandage type as the only covariate. The result of this unadjusted analysis
                        indicated no significant difference between bandage types: hazard ratio
                        1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.37; P=0.11.

The next Cox model (five trials, 797 patients, 75/797 cases dropped) included
                        all significant covariates identified during univariate analyses: bandage
                        type, patient’s age, ulcer duration, ulcer area, and ankle mobility. We used
                        a backward elimination method to remove covariates that became
                        non-significant one at a time, until the model contained only those making a
                        significant contribution. The final model contained type of bandage, ulcer
                        duration, and ulcer area (table 3). The
                        hazard ratio for bandage type was 1.31 (1.09 to 1.58; P=0.005), indicating
                        that the estimated probability of healing with four layer bandage was around
                        1.3 times that of healing with the short stretch bandage, assuming similar
                        values for other covariates. There was significant evidence that larger
                        ulcers (P<0.001) and ulcers of longer duration (P<0.001)
                        predicted longer time to healing independently of one another and of
                        treatment. The chance of healing was reduced by a factor of 0.44 for each
                        10-fold increase in area. We categorised baseline ulcer duration into
                        ≤1month, >1-6 months, >6-12 months, and >12 months. The
                        data suggest that the hazard of healing was reduced for each step up to a
                        longer duration interval. We found no significant interactions between
                        bandage and baseline ulcer area and bandage and ulcer duration. Figure
                            3 illustrates the relative contribution
                        of each trial to the meta-analysis, showing pooled and individual trial
                        hazard ratio estimates derived from individual patient data and adjusted for
                        baseline ulcer area and baseline ulcer duration (heterogeneity between
                        trials: χ2 test P=0.11, I2=47.7%).

We re-ran the analysis on a subset of four trials (747 patients, 83/747
                        dropped) for which additional covariates were available: primary or
                        recurrent ulceration and patients’ mobility.w1 w4 w5 w6 The final
                        model contained bandage type, ulcer area, ulcer duration, and primary or
                        recurrent ulceration. The estimated hazard ratio for type of bandage was
                        similar to the model based on five trials: 1.29, 1.06 to 1.57; P=0.011. The
                        model suggested that larger ulcers (P<0.001), ulcers of longer
                        duration (P<0.001), and previous ulceration (P<0.005) were
                        independent predictors of longer time to healing (table 4). We found no significant interactions
                        between bandage and baseline ulcer area, bandage and baseline ulcer
                        duration, and bandage and primary or recurrent ulceration. The level of
                        statistical heterogeneity between trials did not attain our prespecified
                        level of significance (χ2 test P=0.11, I2=50.0%).

Adverse events
Two trials provided data on adverse events.w1 w6 For incidence of any
                    type of adverse event, the pooled odds ratio (fixed effect) was 1.15 (95%
                    confidence interval 0.81 to 1.62; P=0.43) (fig 4), providing no evidence of a difference between bandage types. The two trials
                    differed in their definitions of adverse events related to bandaging. One trial
                    coded events such as maceration, allergic reaction, eczema of periulcer skin,
                    and infection as bandage related.w1 Another trial, which compared
                    primary dressings as well as bandages, attributed these events to the
                        former.w6 In view of this difference, we did not pool data. We
                    estimated odds ratios for each trial individually and neither showed a
                    significant difference between groups: 1.41 (0.94 to 2.11)w1 and 0.78
                    (0.30 to 2.04).w6

                            event

Analysis of the number of all types of adverse event per patient did not show a
                    difference between the two bandage systems: pooled weighted mean difference
                    (random effects) 0.21 (95% confidence interval −0.27 to 0.68; P=0.39) (fig
                        5). Again, we did not pool data for adverse
                    events related to bandaging for the reasons mentioned above. We found no
                    significant differences between groups for the trials individually (0.45 (−0.11
                    to 1.01)w1 and −0.04 (−0.17 to 0.09)w6).

Discussion
When compared with short stretch bandage, the four layer bandage increases the chance
                of healing by around 30% when independent prognostic factors are taken into account.
                The change in hazard ratio estimate when we included the prespecified covariates in
                the model is to be expected because the covariates are significant predictors of
                time to healing.20 We therefore consider
                that the estimate adjusted for covariates generated by this meta-analysis provides
                the best unbiased estimate to date of the comparative effects of four layer and
                short stretch bandages on healing of venous leg ulcers. Estimates from tests of
                statistical interaction indicated that the benefit of four layer bandaging is
                consistent across patients with differing prognostic profiles. The largest trial
                incorporated a rigorous economic analysis and concluded that the four layer system
                was the dominant treatment strategy (that is, it had lower costs with greater health
                benefits). The cost per ulcer healed was estimated by taking account of nurse and
                doctor visits (both home and clinic based), visits to hospital, and costs of
                bandages and was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to healing. The mean (95%
                confidence interval) annual costs of treatment were £1298.41 (£1187.83 to £1471.89)
                for the four layer bandage and £1525.73 (£1373.92 to £1716.66) for the short stretch
                bandage, a difference of £227.32 (£16.53 to £448.30) (costs for year
                2001).w1 Only two trials provided adequate data on adverse events.w1
                    w6 The available data represented 546 out of a total of 887 patients known
                to be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis (62% of total randomised patients
                as shown in table 1).

Findings from our meta analysis are consistent with those from prognostic studies in
                suggesting that baseline ulcer area, ulcer duration, and recurrent ulceration are
                independent predictors of time to healing.21
                22
                23 Although the effectiveness of the short
                stretch bandage might be influenced by ankle joint mobility,1 we found no significant interaction in our meta-analysis.
                This is perhaps unsurprising as most patients in the dataset (98%) were able to walk
                unaided or with assistance. Previous findings have indicated that the distinction
                that enables prediction of healing is fixed versus non-fixed joint.21

Strengths and weaknesses
A major strength of this research is the degree of rigour. Our methods were in
                    close accordance with those proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration for
                    conducting systematic reviews of interventions and the Cochrane IPD
                    Meta-analysis Methods Group, the latter being a team who have taken a lead role
                    in developing methods for meta-analyses based on individual patient data.11
                    12

All trials used non-blinded assessment of healing. In the largest trial, healing
                    was confirmed from photographs by an investigator blinded to bandage
                        allocation.w1 Though it is not possible to define the direction
                    or degree of bias that might be present in this meta-analysis from such
                    non-blinded outcome assessment, the potential for this should not be overlooked.

All systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be affected by publication
                        bias.24 As neither summary data nor
                    individual patient data were available for the unpublished trial, and we could
                    not generate a hazard ratio for the unavailable published trial,w2 we
                    could not judge the potential effect of including these trials in the
                    meta-analysis. These trials amounted to fewer than 10% of known randomised
                    patients. While the full dataset is the ideal, the retrieval of around 90% means
                    that the estimate generated can be viewed with confidence.

The analyses reported in tables 3 and 4 are for fixed effects models; they
                    treated the effect of type of bandage as constant across the trials. We checked
                    this assumption by tests of heterogeneity across trials, testing the interaction
                    between type of bandage and trial. For the data relating to table 3 this gave
                        χ2=7.03, df=4, and P=0.13. The corresponding statistics for table
                    4 data were χ2=5.84, df=3, and P=0.12. For both analyses, this test
                    for heterogeneity reached neither the conventional critical P value of 0.05 nor
                    the more sensitive critical value of 0.10 sometimes advocated for this test. We
                    were therefore justified in staying with the fixed effect model. When the
                    assumption of a fixed effect is acceptable, introducing random effects might
                    unnecessarily widen confidence intervals and reduce power. As a sensitivity
                    analysis, however, we allowed for a possible random effect of trial by making
                    the trial a cluster and estimating robust standard errors. This approach does
                    not change the estimates but does change their standard errors. For the model in
                    table 3, the hazard ratio for bandage type was 1.29 (95% confidence interval
                    1.05 to 1.63; P=0.015) and for table 4 was 1.31 (1.04 to 1.60; P=0.023). Hence,
                    whatever the approach taken we have evidence of a beneficial effect of the four
                    layer bandage.

Implications for further research
As far as we can ascertain, this is the first example of meta-analysis of
                    individual patient data in wound research. Further such meta-analyses, including
                    both clinical effectiveness and economic data, could be usefully undertaken in
                    the specialty of chronic wound management given that the main outcome is a time
                    to event variable: time to healing.

Further clinical trials could assess related outcomes such as ulcer recurrence
                    and change in ulcer area both as a predictor and as an outcome. In any future
                    trial the area of the ulcer at baseline, the duration of the ulcer, and whether
                    ulceration is recurrent should be used as stratification variables at
                    randomisation, or should be taken into account in the analysis. Primary
                    investigators should provide detailed records of adverse events in compression
                    trials and should aim to arrive at a consensus as to the types of adverse events
                    attributable to the bandage.

The clinical effect of the bandages might in part depend on the skill of the
                    bandager in achieving the correct amount of sub-bandage pressure and pressure
                    graduated from toe to knee.25
                    Consequently, the differential effects of the bandages seen in this
                    meta-analysis could be partly explained by skill and experience of the bandager;
                    three out of the five included trials (representing 75% of included patients)
                    were based in the UK, where the four layer bandage is standard,w1 w3
                    w6 while the others were based in continental Europe, where the short
                    stretch bandage is standard treatment.w4 w5 Information regarding
                    bandager skill was not collected during the included trials and so we could not
                    investigate this further. As far as we could ascertain, the methods used for
                    application of both types of bandage were in line with manufacturers’
                    recommendations, relevant clinical guidelines, and expert guidance.1
                    26
                    27 Future trials could usefully collect
                    data on staff skills at baseline, and this information could be included as a
                    covariate in the modelling of treatment effect.

Implications for clinical practice
Four layer bandaging seems to be more effective than short stretch bandaging in
                    terms of time to healing. Patients with larger ulcers, more chronic ulcers, and
                    recurrent wounds will have longer healing times, regardless of treatment. The
                    findings are likely to be generalisable to most patients with venous leg ulcers
                    who are treated in outpatient clinics or in the community. The choice of bandage
                    system is likely to be influenced by clinician’s preference, skill, or
                    familiarity with a locally established regimen and local or national prescribing
                    policies. Other factors influencing the uptake of a treatment include cost and
                    acceptability to patients.

Conclusions
Findings suggest that patients with venous leg ulcers treated with four layer
                    bandages experience faster healing than those treated with short stretch
                    bandages. Patients with larger ulcers, older ulcers and recurrent wounds have
                    poorer healing prognosis regardless of treatment. These data suggest, however,
                    that the observed benefits are consistent despite differences in prognosis.
                    Available data from two trials did not suggest a difference in the adverse event
                    profiles of the two bandage types. Further research is required on related
                    outcomes such as ulcer recurrence, change in ulcer area both as a predictor and
                    as an outcome, and cost effectiveness. Future trials should incorporate blinded
                    outcome assessment and, when possible, some assessment of the skill of the
                    bandager at baseline.

What is already known on this topic
Venous leg ulceration is a common and recurring condition that
                                    imposes a considerable burden on patients and healthcare
                                    providers

Compression treatment is the first line treatment, commonly
                                    applied as a four layer bandage in the UK and short stretch
                                    bandage in other parts of the world

A systematic review of compression based on published trial
                                    reports did not detect a difference between the two methods in
                                    terms of the number of patients healed at fixed time points

What this study adds
When compared with the short stretch bandage, the four layer
                                    bandage increases the chance of healing by around 30% when
                                    independent prognostic factors are taken into account

The benefit of the four layer bandage is consistent across
                                    patients with differing prognostic profiles, independent
                                    predictors of delayed healing being larger baseline ulcer area,
                                    more chronic ulceration, and previous ulceration
