Study question What are the characteristics of the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) postmarketing requirements, and what are the rates of registration and results reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov and publication in peer reviewed journals of required prospective cohort studies, registries, and clinical trials?


Methods Postmarketing requirements known at the time of FDA approval (including FDA authority, study design, and study characteristics) for all new drugs and biologics approved in 2009-12 were characterised by use of publicly available FDA documents. ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for registration records, reported results, and publications in peer reviewed journals for all required prospective cohort studies, registries, and clinical trials.


Study answer and limitations Between 2009 and 2012, the FDA approved 97 new drugs and biologics for 106 indications with at least one postmarketing requirement at the time of first approval (437 postmarketing requirements in total). Many postmarketing requirements were briefly described (median word count of 44 (interquartile range 29-71)) and often lacked information to determine an up to date progress (131 (30%)). Of 134 postmarketing requirements for prospective cohort studies, registries, and clinical trials, 102 (76%) were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov; 47 (72.3%) of 65 completed studies had either reported results on ClinicalTrials.gov or were published a median of 47 (32-67) months after FDA approval. Similar registration and reporting rates were observed in clinical trials only. Publicly available data sources used in the study contained limited information, which made categorizing and determining ClinicalTrials.gov registrations and publications difficult.


What this study adds Postmarket requirements for drugs and biologics are often briefly described in public documents, without enough information to determine the required study characteristics. Although three quarters of postmarketing requirements for prospective cohort studies, registries, and clinical trials were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, at least one quarter of required studies for which results reporting or publication would be expected have not been publicly disseminated.
