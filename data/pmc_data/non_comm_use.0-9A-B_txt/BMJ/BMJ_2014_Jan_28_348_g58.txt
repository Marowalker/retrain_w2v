==== Body
The authors of this Research paper (BMJ 2013;347:f5980, doi:10.1136/bmj.f5980) have informed us that during the revisions process for their manuscript they made some unintentional errors in the entry and calculation of their data. These errors require some corrections, which are listed below, but the authors state that none of the conclusions of their study have been altered by these revisions.

In both the results section of the abstract and the second paragraph of the long results section, the authors note that a reduction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurred with borderline significance in favour of the nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) group. However the relative risk should have been recorded as: “0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.01), risk difference −0.03 (95% confidence interval −0.07 to 0.00).”

In the results section of the abstract, the relative risk of death at 36 weeks corrected gestation should have read 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.04), risk difference −0.02 (95% confidence interval −0.04 to 0.01).

Also, in both the results section of the abstract and the second paragraph of the long results section, the authors conclude: “Pooled analysis showed a significant benefit for the combined outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or both, at 36 weeks corrected gestation for babies treated with nasal CPAP.” However, the relative risk should have read: “0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.98), risk difference −0.04 (95% confidence interval −0.08 to −0.00), NNT of 25.”

In table 3, the first three rows (“Death at 36 weeks corrected gestation,” “BPD at 36 weeks corrected gestation,” and “Death or BPD, or both”) contain some errors and have been republished with their correct values below. This incorrect table also appeared in the print version, which can be viewed online in the “Section PDF.”

Variables	No of studies (references)	Nasal CPAP group	Intubation group	Relative risk (95% CI)	Risk difference (95% CI)	Number needed to treat	
Death at 36 weeks corrected gestation	47-10	134/1296	171/1486	0.84 (0.68 to 1.04)	−0.02 (−0.04 to 0.01)		
BPD at 36 weeks corrected gestation	47-10	387/1173	465/1324	0.91 (0.81 to1.01)	−0.03 (−0.07 to 0.00)		
Death or BPD, or both	47-10	521/1296	636/1486	0.90 (0.83 to 0.98)	−0.04 (−0.08 to −0.00)	25	
CPAP=continuous positive airway pressure; BPD=bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Lastly, figure 2 also contains some inaccuracies and has been republished below.
