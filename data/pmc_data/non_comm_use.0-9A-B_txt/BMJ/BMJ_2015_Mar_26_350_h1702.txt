The data supplement for this Research paper that is labelled “eTables 1-7” contains some errors (BMJ 2014;348:g2272, doi:10.1136/bmj.g2272). This supplement shows details of world regions and countries used in the study, characteristics of data sources, and consumption levels of dietary fats and oils analysed. However, some of the rows in eTables 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 became mixed up when the file was converted from Excel to Word. Please see the linked data supplement in this correction for the correct versions of eTables 3-7 http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1702/related.
