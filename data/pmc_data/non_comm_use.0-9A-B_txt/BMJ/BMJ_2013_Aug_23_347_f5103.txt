The authors of this Research paper have alerted us to an error in table 3 (BMJ 2012;344:e1001, doi:10.1136/bmj.e1001), where the groupings of the index of multiple deprivation are incorrectly labelled. The lowest grouping (1) is, in fact, the most deprived (not “least deprived,” as published), while the highest grouping (5) is the least deprived (not “most deprived,” as published).

For clarification, this means that the column showing the “No (%) of deaths” should be read as: 3.9, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.6 from the most deprived to the least deprived. Similarly, the column showing “All admissions (% of total)” should be read as: 24.3, 20.4, 18.7, 17.3, and 15.6 from the most deprived to the least deprived. In light of this correction, the second sentence in the paragraph above table 3 should have read: “From the fourth category of deprivation crude mortality decreased with increasing deprivation.” The authors would also like to clarify that this mislabelling had no effect on the paper’s models or conclusions. For further discussion on this error and its implications, please see the authors’ rapid response at http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1001/rr/655354
