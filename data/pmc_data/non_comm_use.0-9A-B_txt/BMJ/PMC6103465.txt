An error occurred in the first paragraph of the results section of this paper (BMJ 2018;362:k2562, doi:10.1136/bmj.k2562). The text should have stated that “Between 2010 and 2016, life expectancy increased by only 0.19 years for American women (from 81.21 years to 81.40 years) and by only 0.04 years for American men (from 76.36 [not 73.36 as published] to 76.40 years).”
