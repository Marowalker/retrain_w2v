quality of life in people with knee osteoarthritis and to estimate associated
differences in lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) according
to use by level of symptoms.

Design Marginal structural modeling and cost effectiveness analysis
based on lifetime predictions for total knee replacement and death from
population based cohort data.

Setting Data from two studies—Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and
the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)—within the US health system.

Participants 4498 participants with or at high risk for knee
osteoarthritis aged 45-79 from the OAI with no previous knee replacement
(confirmed by baseline radiography) followed up for nine years. Validation
cohort comprised 2907 patients from MOST with two year follow-up.

Intervention Scenarios ranging from current practice, defined as
total knee replacement practice as performed in the OAI (with procedural rates
estimated by a prediction model), to practice limited to patients with severe
symptoms to no surgery.

Main outcome measures Generic (SF-12) and osteoarthritis specific
quality of life measured over 96 months, model based QALYs, costs, and
incremental cost effectiveness ratios over a lifetime horizon.

Results In the OAI, total knee replacement showed improvements in
quality of life with small absolute changes when averaged across levels of
confounding variables: 1.70 (95% uncertainty interval 0.26 to 3.57) for SF-12
physical component summary (PCS); −10.69 (−13.39 to −8.01) for Western Ontario
and McMaster Universities arthritis index (WOMAC); and 9.16 (6.35 to 12.49) for
knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) quality of life subscale.
These improvements became larger with decreasing functional status at baseline.
Provision of total knee replacement to patients with SF-12 PCS scores <35 was
the optimal scenario given a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY, with
cost savings of $6974 ($5789 to $8269) and a minimal loss of 0.008 (−0.056 to
0.043) QALYs compared with current practice. These findings were reproduced
among patients with knee osteoarthritis from the MOST cohort and were robust
against various scenarios including increased rates of total knee replacement
and mortality and inclusion of non-healthcare costs but were sensitive to
increased deterioration in quality of life without surgery. In a threshold
analysis, total knee replacement would become cost effective in patients with
SF-12 PCS scores ≤40 if the associated hospital admission costs fell below
$14 000 given a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY.

Conclusion Current practice of total knee replacement as performed
in a recent US cohort of patients with knee osteoarthritis had minimal effects
on quality of life and QALYs at the group level. If the procedure were
restricted to more severely affected patients, its effectiveness would rise,
with practice becoming economically more attractive than its current use.
==== Body
Introduction
Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability worldwide,1 resulting in pain, structural changes in the bone and joint
space, and limitation of motion. Disease onset is gradual and usually begins after
the age of 40. Osteoarthritis of the knee has a variable prognosis. Once present,
improvement of joint structure is rare when assessed by radiography, but abatement
of joint pain and disability occurs frequently.2 About 12% of adults in the US are affected.3 The annual rate of total knee replacement in the US has
doubled since 2000, especially in those aged 45-64.4
5 This disproportionate increase in this
practice has been attributed to expansion of eligibility to people with less severe
symptoms.6 The total number of
procedures performed each year now exceeds 640 000, at a total annual cost of about
$10.2bn (£8.3bn, €9.6bn).5

The potential benefit of total knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis
should outweigh the associated costs. A recent randomized controlled trial looked at
replacement compared with non-surgical management alone in 95 patients and showed
large improvements in pain and physical limitations and significant increases in
quality of life at 12 months.7 The trial
population predominantly included patients with severe preoperative symptoms, as
shown by low mean quality of life utility values at baseline.7 Many previously published uncontrolled before-after studies
showed similarly large effects.8
9 In particular, the systematic review by
Shan and colleagues described 19 studies that showed substantial improvements from
baseline status, both in the intermediate and long term, for disease specific and
generic health related quality of life across a broad range of domains.9 It is estimated, however, that up to a third
of recipients of total knee replacement experience chronic pain
postoperatively,10
11 and the health benefits of the procedure
are assumed to be higher in those with poor physical functioning before
surgery.12
13
14 This would imply that patients
undergoing the procedure because of the recently expanded practice in the US might
show less significant improvement in symptoms. Yet, the effectiveness of total knee
replacement has been understudied in patients who are representative for the current
practice population.10
11

We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) to estimate the effect of total
knee replacement according to patients’ functional status by looking at longitudinal
health outcomes of patients with knee osteoarthritis with heterogeneous symptoms who
underwent the procedure compared with those who did not.15 We subsequently performed a decision modeling study to
evaluate the impact of the procedure on lifetime costs and quality adjusted life
years (QALYs) while varying its use by level of symptoms.

Methods
Study populations
We obtained the data for our analysis from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)
database, which is available for public access at http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/.
The OAI is a multi-center cohort study of 4796 individuals with knee
osteoarthritis or at risk for knee osteoarthritis who were recruited from the
general population in 2005-06 across four US centers. Study participants were
aged 45-79 at enrolment and were tracked with repeated follow-up evaluations for
nine years. These evaluations included physical examinations, radiographs of
both knees, and questionnaires on risk factors, symptoms, medical history, and
quality of life. Knee osteoarthritis was defined as the patient having pain,
aching, or stiffness in or around the knee on most days for at least one month
during the past 12 months, and radiographically confirmed tibiofemoral
osteophytes of grades 1-3 according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society
International (OARSI) atlas.16
17 Patients eligible for the current
analysis were those included in the outcomes dataset released 11 October 2015
(n=4796). To develop a decision model for estimating lifetime outcomes, we
excluded participants who had already undergone TKR at baseline, confirmed by
radiography (n=62) and participants from the low osteoarthritis risk,
“non-exposed” control group (n=122) who had no established risk factors,
symptoms or radiographic findings of knee osteoarthritis.18 This resulted in a development sample of 4498 (table
1). OAI participants classified as having
knee osteoarthritis at baseline (n=1327), as opposed to participants who were at
high risk for knee osteoarthritis,were defined as the study population
for estimation of the effect of total knee replacement on quality of life and
use ofnon-surgical treatment for osteoarthritis pain, and for the base
case cost effectiveness analysis. To validate the effect estimates, we repeated
similar analyses with 30 months’ follow-up data on 965 participants with knee
osteoarthritis at baseline of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST).23 To show generalizability of the base
case cost effectiveness analysis, we performed a scenario analysis using the 965
MOST patients.

Modeling effect of total knee replacement on quality of life and use of
non-surgical treatment
Outcomes were defined as the SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) score, the
SF-12 mental component summary (MCS) score, the SF-6D utility index, the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities arthritis index (WOMAC), the quality of life
subscale on the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and self
reported use of pain medication for osteoarthritis, all measured at 12, 24, 36,
48, 72, and 96 months. We evaluated the effect of total knee replacement on use
of non-pharmacological treatments with measurements at 24, 48, and 96 months, as
questions on these treatments were not included at the other study visits. The
SF-12 instrument is a single page questionnaire measuring generic quality of
life.24 To estimate this, we
calculated the SF-6D utility index, which can be directly derived from SF-12 by
using a previously published algorithm.25 The KOOS and WOMAC instruments are validated questionnaires
measuring quality of life, pain, stiffness, and functionality specific for
osteoarthritis.24
26
27 We chose to use only the KOOS
quality of life subscale, which measures knee related quality of life and mental
and social aspects such as awareness and lifestyle changes. These items are not
well captured by the WOMAC total score, which focuses on knee symptoms and
functioning. The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient for the two
scores in the 1327 OAI participants with knee osteoarthritis was −0.67.
Osteoarthritis pain medication included acetaminophen (paracetamol),
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)
inhibitors. Non-pharmacological treatments included massage, chiropractic,
acupuncture treatments, and other less commonly used complementary treatment
options such as acupressure, chelation therapy, folk medicine, and homeopathic
treatment.

To estimate the effect of total knee replacement on these longitudinally measured
outcomes compared with no/delayed procedure, we used marginal structural models
for repeated measures defined as weighted generalized estimating equations
(GEEs) with each outcome as the dependent variable.28 Marginal structural models are warranted when outcome
values can vary over time and can predict future treatment assignment along with
other time varying confounders. For example, an increase in use of
osteoarthritis pain medication could be associated with a higher likelihood of
receiving total knee replacement. Each GEE included a treatment variable for the
procedure, which was set to one after performance, a study visit indicator, the
outcome’s baseline value, and other baseline variables including age, sex, race,
income, education, knee injury in medical history, knee surgery in medical
history, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity score,29 use of osteoarthritis pain medication, doctor’s
diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic grade, SF-12
scores, WOMAC total score, and KOOS quality of life. To evaluate the
effectiveness of total knee replacement according to preoperative physical
functioning, we included an interaction term for the procedure with baseline
SF-12 PCS.30
31 Within these GEEs, we included
weights for treatment propensity (that is, the likelihood of having received
total knee replacement) for each study visit. Weights were estimated by logistic
regression models pooled for study visits with the above mentioned baseline
variables, study visit, longitudinally measured BMI, Charlson comorbidity score,
doctor’s diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic grade,
and all outcome variables. The main treatment effect estimate obtained from the
marginal structural modeling should be interpreted as a “time averaged” causal
effect.28

Missing values were imputed 20 times with a flexible additive model including
status variables and the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard for
total knee replacement and death. To estimate parameter uncertainty, we
re-fitted imputation, pooled logistic regression, and GEE models in 500
bootstrap datasets. We used the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of bootstrap effect
estimates for uncertainty interval limits. To validate the effect estimates from
models developed with OAI patients, we performed multivariable adjusted analyses
for SF-12 scores, SF-6D utility index, WOMAC, and use of osteoarthritis pain
medication using 30 months’ follow-up data on 965 MOST participants with knee
osteoarthritis at baseline. All statistical analyses were performed with R
version 3.2.0 (2015, R Foundation for Statistical Computing). For more
information on these statistical analyses see appendix 1.

Modeling of lifetime outcomes and cost effectiveness of total knee
replacement
We developed the KOSMOS (Knee OSteoarthritis MicrOSimulation) model to simulate
the virtual life course of 1327 OAI patients by modeling the occurrence of
primary total knee replacement, revision procedure, and death up to age 100.
Rates of primary total knee replacement and death were modeled by cause specific
multivariable Cox regression with chronological age as time scale. Revision
rates were based on the literature19
using the log cumulative hazard of revision procedure as reported for different
age groups, which was modeled as a linear function of log time since the primary
procedure. Health related SF-6D utility scores, use of osteoarthritis pain
medication, and use of non-pharmacological treatment were based on the patients’
baseline and predicted 96 month values taken from the output of the GEEs with
and without total knee replacement. We used linear interpolation to calculate
patients’ values through eight years. We estimated SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS, and
SF-6D scores for patients alive longer than eight years by linear extrapolation,
based on the observed steady changes over time (figs A-C in appendix 3). Use of
osteoarthritis pain medication and non-pharmacological treatments was assumed to
remain stable after eight years (figs F and G in appendix 3), and the predicted
96 month probability of use was carried forward.

For simulated patients who survived each cycle of the model, we calculated an
undiscounted QALY as the predicted SF-6D score multiplied by one year, thus
resulting in a different QALY outcome for patients receiving total knee
replacement in that cycle. Patients could accrue QALYs in the model until death
or age 100. We calculated effect modification of procedure by SF-12 PCS scores
using the latest predicted score, which was updated every eighth year until
total knee replacement. We assumed that with revision procedure a beneficial
effect on SF-12 PCS, use of osteoarthritis pain medication, and
non-pharmacological treatment would be cancelled out by deterioration and
improvement before and after the revision.32
33

Costs associated with care of knee osteoarthritis and total knee replacement
procedures were estimated from a US health system perspective (table 2) and were either applied for each model cycle
(annual costs associated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment,
physician office visits, and imaging) or as a one off cost penalty (costs
associated with primary and revision procedures and rehabilitation including
physiotherapy). All costs were expressed in 2013 $, with inflation rates
reported in the US healthcare consumer price index.34 We recalibrated the average life expectancy predicted
by the KOSMOS model for the modeled patient cohort to reflect the average life
expectancy as predicted by age and sex specific US 2011 life tables and
validated the KOSMOS model’s predictive performance in OAI and MOST data. More
details on the development and validity of the KOSMOS model are provided in
appendix 1.

*β distributions used for probabilities, γ distributions for costs,
Poisson distribution for counts, and lognormal distributions for one off
quality of life penalties.

For the base case analysis, we modeled 10 scenarios, ranging from current
practice with rates as observed in the OAI, to lower rates of practice in which
the procedure was performed only in individuals with lower SF-12 PCS levels
(from <55-<20), to a scenario without total knee replacement. In the
restricted scenarios, the underlying annual rate was kept the same as modeled
for the current practice scenario, but no effects on quality of life, use of
non-surgical treatment, and costs, and no procedural mortality rates were
incorporated if the preceding SF-12 PCS level was greater than or equal to the
threshold value.

For each scenario, we performed microsimulation of 1327 individuals for each set
of 500 bootstrap equations and calculated the accrued QALYs and costs using the
recommended 3% discount rate.35 We
calculated 95% uncertainty intervals by using the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of
500 modeled outcomes, each averaged across 1327 individuals. We calculated
incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as the difference in
average costs divided by the difference in average QALYs, after ranking
scenarios according to increasing costs and exclusion of dominated scenarios.
Dominated scenarios were defined as programs less effective and more costly than
the previous program (absolutely dominated) and programs with a larger
incremental cost effectiveness ratio than the next not dominated program
(extendedly dominated). We considered cost effectiveness thresholds of $50 000,
$100 000, and $200 000 per QALY for decision making.36

In threshold analyses, we varied the hospital admission costs of primary and
revision total knee replacement and used various percentages up to 100% for a
further decline in quality of life (SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS, and SF-6D) in patients
who were simulated to receive the procedure in the current practice scenario but
were modeled to not receive the procedure in the other scenarios. For modeling
the additional decline, we multiplied the main effect of follow-up time by
values from 1 to 2. We used a time lag of four years after total knee
replacement (equal to the difference in last follow-up measurement and median
time to the procedure), so that the further decrease would reflect a long term
effect of total knee replacement that we could have missed using OAI data.

We performed a scenario analysis using the 965 MOST patients after recalibration
of hazard rates for total knee replacement and an analysis using EuroQol (EQ)-5d
utility values as a substitute for SF-6D values by conversion of SF-12 MCS and
PCS scores by a published equation.37
38
39 In additional analyses, we modeled
an increased rate of primary total knee replacement up to 30% to investigate the
impact of a further increase in procedure rates as observed in the US after
2006.5 We also increased the
background mortality rate based on findings that patients with osteoarthritis
might have an excess all cause mortality compared with the general population by
multiplying mortality rates by standardized mortality ratios sampled from a
lognormal distribution (mean 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.41 to 1.70).40 Finally, we performed an analysis
exploring the potential influence of non-healthcare costs and loss of
productivity not captured by a decrease in health utility,41 through inclusion of costs due to work time lost by
patients and cost of informal caregiving. More details on these sensitivity
analyses are provided in appendix 1.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or
implementation of the studies, nor were they involved in developing the research
questions and outcome measures. No patients were asked to advice on
interpretation or writing up of results. Plans are in place for dissemination of
the results of the research to the patient community. These plans include
providing manuscript summaries to media sources, osteoarthritis charities,
provider bodies, and patient organizations, in addition to social media
announcements and institutional provision of pamphlets in health system waiting
areas.

Results
Study populations
The 1327 OAI participants with knee osteoarthritis at baseline had worse SF-12
PCS, SF-6D, and osteoarthritis specific quality of life scores than the 3171 at
high risk for knee osteoarthritis (P<0.001, table 1). There were 382 total knee replacements, of which 319 were
done before the 96 month visit, and 255 were in the 1327 with knee
osteoarthritis at baseline. In the MOST cohort (table A, appendix 2), 135 total
knee replacements were performed in 965 participants with knee osteoarthritis at
baseline, and 16 were performed in 1719 individuals at high risk of knee
osteoarthritis, all before the 30 month visit.

Effect of total knee replacement on quality of life and use of non-surgical
treatment
Figures A-G in appendix 3 show time trends of SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS, SF-6D, WOMAC,
KOOS quality of life, use of osteoarthritis pain medication, and
non-pharmacological treatments, specified for those who did and did not undergo
total knee replacement. After adjustment for baseline and time varying
confounders, the main effects of total knee replacement (that is, treatment
effects averaged across confounding variable levels and follow-up time)
comprised an absolute improvement of 1.70 points (95% uncertainty interval 0.26
to 3.57) on SF-12 PCS, and changes in SF-12 MCS of −0.22 (−1.49 to 1.31) and
SF-6D of 0.008 (−0.008 to 0.028) point. For each unit decrease in baseline SF-12
PCS, the effect on SF-6D increased and could be calculated as 0.098−0.002×(SF-12
PCS), suggesting that total knee replacement would become more effective if it
was restricted to patients with SF-12 PCS scores <50. For osteoarthritis
specific measures of quality of life, the procedure’s main effects included
improvement of the WOMAC score by 10.69 (8.01 to 13.39) and KOOS quality of life
of 9.16 (6.35 to 12.49) points. Total knee replacement reduced the odds of use
of medication for osteoarthritis pain, but this effect was uncertain, with an
odds ratio of 0.81 (0.55 to 1.12). Use of non-pharmacological treatment did not
significantly seem to change with total knee replacement (0.91, 0.55 to 1.77).
These effects were generally consistent with those obtained from multivariable
adjusted analyses of MOST data, although in MOST the effect on SF-12 MCS was
positive in contrast with the effect in OAI (table 3).

Lifetime outcomes and cost effectiveness of total knee replacement
practice
In the current practice scenario, the lifetime likelihood of undergoing total
knee replacement, as predicted for OAI, was 39.9% (95% uncertainty interval 34.5
to 45.3), and the average undiscounted life expectancy was 22.39 years (21.13 to
23.85 years). Modeled quality of life values and proportions of use of
non-surgical treatments over time were generally most favorable in the current
practice scenario, except for SF-12 MCS scores (figs I-M, appendix 3). The mean
discounted QALYs in the current practice scenario were 11.18 (10.66 to 11.70)
and costs were $17 168 ($15 307 to $19 124).

In the base case cost effectiveness analysis, only the ICER of total knee
replacement for those with SF-12 PCS <20 fell below $100 000/QALY. The
optimal scenario given a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY was
surgery for those with SF-12 PCS scores <35; surgery for those with SF-12 PCS
<40 was borderline cost effective. Compared with current practice,
restriction of surgery to those with SF-12 PCS <35 would decrease the
lifetime likelihood of total knee replacement to 10.2% (95% uncertainty 8.1 to
12.4), and would save $6974 ($5789 to $8269) per patient, whereas the
effectiveness would be only slightly lower at −0.008 (−0.056 to 0.043) QALYs.
The ICER of this strategy compared with the previous best scenario was
$160 974/QALY (table 4 and fig 1). The current practice scenario was less effective
and more expensive than the more restrictive scenarios with SF-12 PCS threshold
values of 40-55 and therefore dominated. None of the ICERs fell below the
$50 000/QALY threshold. The likelihood that the current practice scenario would
be considered to be cost effective was low for cost effectiveness thresholds
below $200 000/QALY (fig N, appendix 3).

Sensitivity analyses
With a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY, restriction of surgery to
those withSF-12 PCS <40 became attractive if the hospital admission
costs of primary total knee replacement fell below $14 000. If the admission
costs of primary total knee replacement fell below $8000, restriction of surgery
to those withSF-12 PCS <30 would become economically attractive
given a cost effectiveness threshold of $100 000/QALY. Cost effectiveness
outcomes were not sensitive to the admission costs of revision procedures.

Simulation of the MOST population with knee osteoarthritis provided much higher
lifetime likelihoods of total knee replacement, but similar ICERs, although
restriction of surgery to those withSF-12 PCS <40 now became the
optimal scenario at a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY (table E in
appendix 2). Use of EQ-5D utility values improved ICERs, with the ICER of
restriction of surgery to those withSF-12 PCS <40 now amply falling
below $200 000/QALY (table F in appendix 2). Increasing rates of primary total
knee replacement or background mortality only minimally affected incremental
cost effectiveness outcomes, and restriction of surgery to those
withSF-12 PCS <35 remained the optimal scenario at a cost
effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY (tables G and H in appendix 2).

Inclusion of costs associated with work days lost (see table D in appendix 2) and
informal caregiving did not have a major impact on the cost effectiveness
results: again restriction of surgery to those withSF-12 PCS <35 was
the optimal scenario at a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY (table I
in appendix 2). If patients who would receive total knee replacement in current
practice, but not in the more restrictive scenarios, experienced an additional
decline of 50% in quality of life over the long term, all scenarios of
performing total knee replacement including current practice became economically
attractive given a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY and with an
additional decline of 80% given a cost effectiveness threshold of
$100 000/QALY.

Discussion
Principal findings
We evaluated the effectiveness of total knee replacement on quality of life and
use of non-surgical treatment in a recent US cohort of patients with knee
osteoarthritis. Compared with patients who did not undergo total knee
replacement, generic quality of life scores (on SF-12 physical) and those
related to osteoarthritis improved with performance of the procedure, with
larger improvements generally in those with a lower SF-12 physical score at
baseline. Changes in use of osteoarthritis pain medication and SF-12 mental
scores were small and heterogeneous across the two cohorts. In a cost
effectiveness analysis modeling the life courses of OAI patients with knee
osteoarthritis with inclusion of utility values derived from the SF-12, current
practice was more expensive and in some cases even less effective compared with
scenarios in which total knee replacement was performed only in patients with
lower physical functioning. At the group level, the economically most attractive
strategy was performing the procedure in those with a SF-12 PCS <35, assuming
a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000 per QALY. These findings were
reproduced among knee osteoarthritis patients from the MOST cohort. Extension of
the use of total knee replacement to those with a SF-12 physical score of ≤40
would become financially attractive if the hospital admission costs fell below
$14 000.

Comparison with other studies
Scenarios of total knee replacement restricted to those with lower SF-12 PCS
scores provided higher QALYs in our cost effectiveness analysis because small
improvements in quality of life after the procedure became more prominent in
people with lower baseline scores. A recently published randomized controlled
trial showed larger effects of total knee replacement on quality of life
measures than we found. 7 The OAI
patient population undergoing total knee replacement, however, had on average
less severe symptoms before surgery compared with the population from that
randomized controlled trial, and the mean follow-up duration was longer in the
OAI. Moreover, measures of quality of life were assessed independently of care
providers in the OAI, contributing to a more limited potential for reporting
desirable answers on quality of life scores before and after surgery.42
43 Recent uncontrolled before-after
studies have also shown larger effects of total knee replacement, generally
including improvements in SF-12 PCS scores of 5-15 points.32

49 Similar to SF-12 PCS, larger effects
have been shown in before-after studies for quality of life measures specific to
osteoarthritis.13
32
44
54
55 As with the study population in the
randomized controlled trial, however, the preoperative quality of life scores
for these studies were on average worse than those of our study population and
the duration of follow-up was generally shorter, possibly explaining the larger
effects.

In addition to our analysis, three observational studies have compared quality of
life outcomes in patients who did and did not undergo total knee
replacement.12
56
57 Two of these studies were not
designed to prospectively collect data on generic and osteoarthritis related
quality of life measures in people who did not and did undergo the
procedure.12
56 In a single hospital prospective
cohort study (n=174) including 30 patients who received total knee replacement,
there were large improvements in SF-12 PCS (9.6 points) and total WOMAC (24.2
points) scores at 12 months after joint replacement. The effect estimation,
however, included effects of hip replacements (n=21), which generally have much
larger effects than knee replacements.47
49 Modeling studies that investigated
the cost effectiveness of total knee replacement all used effects from
before-after studies with larger marginal effects on quality of life,
contributing to much lower estimated ICERs than we found.13

Strengths and limitations of study
We estimated the effectiveness of total knee replacement versus no or delayed
surgery in a large population based sample, the OAI cohort study, adjusting for
baseline and time varying variables using marginal structural models. Marginal
structural modeling has been shown to produce unbiased estimates of causal
treatment effects.28 The larger number
of procedures in our analysis enabled us to evaluate effect modification by
baseline symptoms. Effect estimates and modification by baseline physical
functional scores obtained in OAI were generally consistent with those found in
the MOST population. Nevertheless, our findings should be interpreted in light
of several limitations. First, the knee osteoarthritis populations of the OAI
and MOST might not be representative of the current total population of patients
with knee osteoarthritis in the US, limiting the generalizability of our
findings. For example, younger patients might have been under-represented,
contributing to fewer lower quality of life values from symptoms affecting work
and other regular activities. Yet, both studies recruited participants from the
general population across different regions in the US and obtained detailed
information on risk factors, total knee replacements, and outcome measures
independently from the hospital in which procedures were performed. Furthermore,
our conclusions were unaffected by an increase in the rate of total knee
replacement, resembling the most recent increase in use on a national level.
Second, the study visits performed within OAI and MOST did not allow for
measurement of outcomes immediately before procedures, and ignoring worsening
symptoms just before could cause an underestimation of the true effect. We,
however, adjusted for differences in 12 month changes in use of osteoarthritis
pain medication, Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic grade, and quality of life
scores assessed at the visit preceding total knee replacement. In addition, no
changes in quality of life are observed at 12 months before procedures versus at
one month before,50 and an immediate
worsening of symptoms as a reason for undergoing total knee replacement is not
likely as patients generally defer surgery for years before finally
proceeding.60
61
62 Third, as our study was based on
analyses of non-randomized data without an intention to treat principle,
residual confounding by indication and selection bias could be possible. Fourth,
the self reported outcomes available in the retrospective data, such as use of
osteoarthritis pain medication and loss of productivity, could potentially have
influenced outcomes because of reporting bias or non-differential overestimation
and underestimation. Finally, we made several assumptions in our cost
effectiveness analysis. In any modeling study, a trade-off must be made between
comprehensively including consequences of each strategy and their relevance to
the decision problem at hand. We developed our decision model using individual
level data on quality of life, treatment use, and survival, which allowed us to
incorporate correlation between the model parameters while assessing
uncertainty. Unfortunately, the OAI and MOST studies did not include collection
of cost data. We therefore had to estimate costs using the best available
external data sources, which might not have been representative for our patient
cohort.

Conclusions and policy implications
Improvements in quality of life with total knee replacement were on average
smaller than previously shown. Given its limited effectiveness in individuals
with less severely affected physical function, performance of total knee
replacement in these patients seems to be economically unjustifiable.
Considerable cost savings could be made by limiting eligibility to patients with
more symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Only one randomized controlled trial has
so far been published evaluating total knee replacement as an adjunct treatment
to optimized non-surgical treatment, but it did not include results according to
symptom status.7 Our findings emphasize
the need for more research comparing total knee replacement with less expensive,
more conservative interventions, particularly in patients with less severe
symptoms, and research aiming to develop individualized prediction models for a
better selection of patients with a predicted large net benefit from the
procedure. These interventions can then be compared within cost effectiveness
analyses, for which non-US data sources should be considered as well. In
conclusion, the practice of total knee replacement as performed in a recent US
cohort of patients with knee osteoarthritis had minimal effects on quality of
life. If the procedure were restricted to patients with more severe functional
status, however, its effectiveness would rise, with practice becoming
economically more attractive.

What is already known on this topic
Rates of total knee replacement in the US have more than doubled
since 2000, primarily because of expanding eligibility to
patients with less symptomatic knee osteoarthritis

Up to a third of recipients of total knee replacement experience
chronic pain postoperatively, and health benefits are assumed to
be higher in those with poor preoperative physical
functioning

What this study adds
Quality of life outcomes generally improve after total knee
replacement, with small effects becoming larger with decreasing
preoperative functional status

The practice of total knee replacement as performed in a recent
US cohort of patients with knee osteoarthritis had minimal
effects on QALYs at the group level and was found to be
economically unattractive

Total knee replacement practice, however, could be considered
cost effective if the procedure were restricted to patients with
more severely affected functional status
