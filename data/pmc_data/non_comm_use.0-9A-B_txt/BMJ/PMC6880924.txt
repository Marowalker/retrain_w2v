In this paper by Kortekangas and colleagues (BMJ 2019;364:k5432, doi:10.1136/bmj.k5432, 23 January 2019), table 2 contained several errors. In the correct version (see linked file) the order of devices and duration of wear have been transposed in each of the headings for the last two columns and the term “cast” added to the final column for six week duration. The numbers and percentages for nerve compression and plaster/orthosis sore have been aligned correctly and the point estimate for three week orthosis versus six week cast has been rounded to 0.1.
