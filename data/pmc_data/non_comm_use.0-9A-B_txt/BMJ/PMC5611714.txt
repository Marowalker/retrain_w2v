==== Body
During the editing process of this Research paper (BMJ 2017;358:j3927, doi:10.1136/bmj.j3927) the word ‘not’ was omitted from the following sentence in the Discussion (third paragraph): “However, the higher relapse rate in the placebo group is probably attributable to withdrawal symptoms—that is, most of the studies tapered antidepressants thereby diminishing withdrawal symptoms.” This sentence should read: “However, the higher relapse rate in the placebo group is probably not attributable to withdrawal symptoms—that is, most of the studies tapered antidepressants thereby diminishing withdrawal symptoms.” This has now been corrected.
