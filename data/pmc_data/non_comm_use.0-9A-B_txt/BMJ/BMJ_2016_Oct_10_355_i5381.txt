==== Body
In the PDF version of this Research Methods and Reporting article by Sunita Vohra and colleagues, which also appeared in The BMJ’s academic print issue in July 2015, a production error occurred in table 1 “CENT 2015 checklist” (BMJ 2015;350:h1738, doi:10.1136/bmj.h1738). CENT 2015 item 4c mistakenly referred to Research Methods and Reporting studies and should have read: “Whether the trial(s) represents a research study and if so, whether institutional ethics approval was obtained.”
