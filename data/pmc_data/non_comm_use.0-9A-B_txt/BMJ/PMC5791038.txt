==== Body
The results section of this Research paper (BMJ 2017;359:j4788, doi:10.1136/bmj.j4788), contained an error. Data under the heading “Prevalence of myocardial infarction and positive predictive value of cardiac troponin in selected patients (UK)” were inadvertently replaced with US data from the paragraph below. The second sentence should read “Type 1 myocardial infarction was adjudicated in 843 (14.5%) patients, with 229 (3.9%) patients classified as having type 2 myocardial infarction and 341 (5.9%) as having myocardial injury.” The PDF for the paper has been amended.
