In this paper by Lesley M E McCowan and colleagues, a processing error meant that the data on ethnic origin in table 1 were misaligned (BMJ 2009;338:b1081, doi:10.1136/bmj.b1081). The data slipped up a row, so the first row (starting 1725) should have been aligned with the heading “European”. The final row should have been headed “Other”.
