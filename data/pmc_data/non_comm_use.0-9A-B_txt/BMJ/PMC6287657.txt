(“Stepping Up”) with usual primary care in normalising insulin initiation for
type 2 diabetes, leading to improved glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.

Design Cluster randomised controlled trial.

Setting Primary care practices in Victoria, Australia, with a
practice nurse and at least one consenting eligible patient (HbA1c ≥7.5% with
maximal oral treatment).

Participants 266 patients with type 2 diabetes and 74 practices
(mean cluster size 4 (range 1-8) patients), followed up for 12 months.

Intervention The Stepping Up model of care intervention involved
theory based change in practice systems and reorientation of the roles of health
professionals in the primary care diabetes team. The core components were an
enhanced role for the practice nurse in leading insulin initiation and mentoring
by a registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials.

Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c.
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who transitioned to
insulin, proportion who achieved target HbA1c, and a change in depressive
symptoms (patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9), diabetes specific distress
(problem areas in diabetes scale, PAID), and generic health status (assessment
of quality of life instrument, AQoL-8D).

Results HbA1c improved in both arms, with a clinically significant
between arm difference (mean difference −0.6%, 95% confidence interval −0.9% to
−0.3%), favouring the intervention. At 12 months, in intervention practices,
105/151 (70%) of participants had started insulin, compared with 25/115 (22%) in
control practices (odds ratio 8.3, 95% confidence interval 4.5 to 15.4,
P<0.001). Target HbA1c (≤7% (53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 54 (36%)
intervention participants and 22 (19%) control participants (odds ratio 2.2, 1.2
to 4.3, P=0.02). Depressive symptoms did not worsen at 12 months (PHQ-9: −1.1
(3.5) v −0.1 (2.9), P=0.05). A statistically significant
difference was found between arms in the mean change in mental health (AQoL
mental component summary: 0.04 (SD 0.16) v −0.002 (0.13), mean
difference 0.04 (95% confidence interval 0.002 to 0.08), P=0.04), favouring the
intervention, but no significant difference in physical health (AQoL physical
component summary: 0.03 (0.15) v 0.02 (0.13)) nor diabetes
specific distress (5.6 (15.5) v −2.4 (15.4)). No severe
hypoglycaemia events were reported.

Conclusions The Stepping Up model of care was associated with
increased insulin initiation rates in primary care, and improvements in glycated
haemoglobin without worsening emotional wellbeing.

==== Body
Introduction
Nearly 600 million people worldwide will have type 2 diabetes by 2030.1 Innovation in delivering effective clinical
care to these people is therefore an urgent global priority. To reduce the risk of
long term macrovascular and microvascular complications,2 UK, European, and US guidelines recommend early adoption of
insulin as part of stepwise treatment intensification to bring glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) below a general target of 7% (53 mmol/mol).3
4
5
6 Insulin initiation is often delayed,
however, particularly in primary care,7
where implementation is not widespread despite being recommended as part of routine
clinical management of type 2 diabetes.6 The
mean HbA1c of people with type 2 diabetes before starting insulin is typically
1.5-2.0% above target: 9.3% (78 mmol/mol) in the UK,8 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) in a study in the US,9 8.9% (74 mmol/mol) in a large, multicountry primary care
study,10 and 9.4% (79 mmol/mol) in a
community study in Australia (after a median diabetes duration of 8.1 years).11

Delay in treatment intensification by healthcare professionals, despite evidence that
intensification is warranted and effective,12 is a major barrier to initiating insulin in people with type 2
diabetes.13 The delay can be due to
health professional factors14 (for example,
concerns about hypoglycaemia risk, lack of confidence or skills in insulin
initiation or titration), health system factors15 (competing priorities in busy, reactive primary care settings), and
patient related factors (psychological resistance to insulin inititation16). Supporting and embedding insulin
initiation in routine primary care practice is an important first step in
potentially reducing referrals to costly secondary care, and in supporting timely,
early optimisation of treatment, to better achieve glycaemic targets.

Our trial investigated the effectiveness of a new model of care: the Stepping Up
model, which was designed to support insulin initiation in primary care among people
with type 2 diabetes for whom it is clinically indicated. The Stepping Up model of
care is built around an enhanced, reconfigured role for primary care practice
nurses,17 who represent a rapidly
growing section of the workforce and have a substantial role in the management of
chronic conditions. Our approach was to train and mentor nurses to enhance their
knowledge, skills, and confidence in discussing and implementing insulin initiation
within the practice as a part of routine care. Furthermore, we aimed to set simple
clinical protocols on insulin initiation. To implement these behaviour changes in
professionals, we drew on normalisation process theory18 and the results of pilot studies.17
19 Our aim was to address clinician and
system level barriers to timely insulin initiation, and to normalise insulin
initiation as part of standard primary care practice. We hypothesised that HbA1c
would improve among participants in intervention arm practices, facilitated through
timely insulin initiation, compared with the control arm. Furthermore, based on
previous research,20
21 we expected no major negative effect on
participants’ general emotional wellbeing (depressive symptoms).

Methods
Study design and participants
The study design and protocol have been described previously.22 In summary, we conducted a 12 month,
two arm, non-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial, consistent with
CONSORT guidelines,23 to investigate
the effectiveness of the Stepping Up model of care compared with usual care.

General practices in Victoria, Australia, were eligible if they had at least one
consenting general practitioner and practice nurse and could identify at least
one eligible patient participant: adults with type 2 diabetes with above target
HbA1c (≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol)) in the past six months who were already prescribed
maximum oral treatment (at least two oral hypoglycaemia agents at maximum doses)
or if their GP judged that insulin would be clinically appropriate. Patients
were ineligible if they were aged more than 80 years, were already using
insulin, had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30
mL/min/1.73m2, were unable to give informed consent, or had a
complex debilitating medical condition, such as severe mental illness, end stage
cancer, or unstable cardiovascular disease.

Our original protocol was based on 58 practices and an average cluster size of 5.
From our early recruitment experience and what was an achievable sample size, we
subsequently revised this to 74 practices and an average cluster size of 3
(appendix files).

Randomisation
The unit of randomisation was the primary care practice. The study statistician
computer generated stratified block randomisation sequences with varying block
sizes (4, 6, and 8) before recruitment. Practices were stratified by size (≤2
versus >2 full time equivalent GPs), setting (private practice versus
community health centre), and participation (or not) in type 2 diabetes quality
improvement programmes (the Australian Primary Care Collaborative). After
providing consent and recruiting at least one eligible patient, practices were
randomised to intervention or usual care. We used this index case method24 in all practices because our previous
experience suggested that delaying randomisation of a cluster until all patients
had been recruited risked loss of engagement of GPs.25 The research team then assisted practices to continue
to identify and recruit patient participants (through searching the practice
medical record database). This meant that allocation concealment after the index
case was recruited was not possible for the GP and practice nurse. To minimise
potential bias, participating patients were not informed of their study
allocation until after they had provided consent. Blinding of GP, practice
nurse, and patient was also not possible given the pragmatic nature of the
intervention.

Intervention
The Stepping Up model of care, described elsewhere,17
22 involved a reorientation of existing
resources. Firstly, it included an enhanced role for the practice nurse in
leading the discussion with patients about intensifying treatment through
insulin initiation and titration. Secondly, the model of care set simple
clinical protocols for insulin initiation and up-titration. Thirdly, the model
of care reoriented the role of the specialist registered nurse with diabetes
educator credentials in mentoring the practice nurse, rather than providing
direct patient care. Intervention practices had an in-practice briefing and
training session of 60-90 minutes for GPs and practice nurses, after which
patients with confirmed eligibility and completed baseline data were invited to
consult their GP for an assessment to discuss treatment intensification and
referral to the practice nurse. Practice nurses did not prescribe insulin or
manage insulin dosing without liaison with the GP, based on the legal scope of
practice for generalist practice nurses in Australia.

Our model of care involved the acknowledgment and discussion with patients of the
advantages and disadvantages of starting insulin treatment, including weight
gain. We modelled shared decision making as a part of the intervention training,
drawing on the principles of motivational interviewing. This set the scene for
encouraging practitioners in intervention practices to approach participating
patients with equipoise in relation to starting insulin. The intervention was
necessarily brief in this pragmatic trial; however, we included in it guidance
and checklists for GPs and practice nurses to discuss the pros and cons of
insulin treatment and to elicit patient concerns and expectations, while also
openly acknowledging and accepting that some patients may choose not to start
insulin.

The role of the registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials in supporting
and mentoring the practice nurse, and of the practice nurse in leading the
discussion and implementation of insulin treatment with the patient in liaison
with the GP, is outlined elsewhere.15
20 Titration protocols were based on
fasting blood glucose levels and use of a three day, 7 point blood glucose
profile26 to identify the meal with
the greatest postprandial excursion (see appendix files). We gave no additional
instructions, so the GP had clinical autonomy regarding the management of oral
hypoglycaemia agents. Practice nurses and GPs were encouraged to see patients as
often as thought to be clinically appropriate over a period of up to 12 months,
drawing as needed on the study registered nurse with diabetes educator
credentials for mentoring and support, even if the patient remained undecided
about, or had decided against, starting insulin. Further details about the
intervention can be found in the referenced papers and appendices (see appendix
files).

We gave control arm practices a copy of the Australian type 2 diabetes management
guidelines27 and offered them
training in the Stepping Up model of care after the 12 month follow-up of
patient participants was complete.

Patient involvement
We sought feedback from participants after conducting an intervention pilot
study15 and used this feedback to
refine the model of care. We sought further participant feedback in a pilot of
the data collection forms. Throughout the main trial we communicated with
patient participants through a regular newsletter that included aggregate data
about study progress and opportunities to provide feedback to the study team. We
assessed the burden of the intervention on patients through interviews conducted
at the end of the trial, as part of process evaluation (to be reported
elsewhere). This evaluation was led by the Chronic Illness Alliance, a consumer
advocacy organisation that has been a long term collaborator of our research
group. We have thanked all participants for their involvement in the trial, and
will provide, at a later date, a final summary report of the trial outcomes.
Participants have access to the study website where all published results will
be publicly available.

Endpoints and data collection
Our intervention targeted a process of care (insulin initiation); however, we
chose a clinically meaningful disease outcome at an individual patient level as
a primary endpoint: change (from baseline to 12 months) in HbA1c, measured as a
continuous variable. We registered our primary outcome as an absolute HbA1c
reduction of 0.5% in the intervention group compared with the control group.
Measurement of HbA1c was performed at pathology laboratories aligned with the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the result was communicated to
clinicians and patients as part of usual clinical care. Researchers retrieved
these data from medical records or directly from pathology laboratories.
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who transitioned to
insulin (this was amended from the original protocol where rate of insulin
initiation was used, which proved impractical given the small cluster size in
the study), the proportion who achieved a target HbA1c of ≤7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at
12 months, and change (from baseline to 12 months) in depressive symptoms (nine
item patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9),28 diabetes specific distress (problem areas in diabetes scale,
PAID),29 and generic health status
(assessment of quality of life instrument, AQoL-8D).30 The Appendix files show differences between the
registered outcomes reported here and those registered in the trial registry,
and justification and explanation for any changes made. We also collected data
on healthcare utilisation and costs, to be reported elsewhere.

All participants were provided with a blood glucose meter (Performa Nano; Roche
Diagnostics) and instructed on its use. Subsidised low cost blood glucose
testing strips were available through the National Diabetes Service Scheme.31 Data were uploaded from the meter at
six and 12 months to a secure server.

Statistical analysis
Our statistical analysis plan has been published elsewhere.22 In brief, our sample size of 224 patients from 74
general practices (averaging three patients per practice) allowed us to detect
an absolute 0.5% mean HbA1c difference at 12 months between control and
intervention arms with 80% power and standard deviation of 1 using a two sided α
of 0.05. Data were analysed using Stata 13 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Descriptive
statistics were used to summarise GP, practice nurse, and patient
characteristics for the two study arms. Parametric data are reported as means
(standard deviations) and non-parametric data as medians (interquartile ranges).
Categorical data are reported as numbers (percentages). The individual patient
was the unit of analysis and the analytical methods allow for clustering of
patients within the practices. We compared binary outcomes between the two study
arms with marginal logistic modelling using generalised estimating equations
with robust standard errors and adjustment for baseline measures and clustering.
Mixed effects linear regression was used to determine predictors for continuous
outcomes, adjusting for baseline measures and clustering at the practice level.
A t test for proportions was used to compare the use of
non-insulin agents between arms at 12 months, and a Wilcoxon ranked sum test was
used to compare the number of days since insulin was started between control and
intervention groups. Analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis. All
participants gave informed consent before enrolment.

Results
Participating practices and patients
Between October 2012 and January 2014, 93 primary care practices expressed
interest and identified 521 potentially eligible patients (fig 1). Subsequently, 19 practices did not consent any
eligible patients, leaving 74 participating practices for randomisation. Two
hundred and 50 five of the potentially eligible patients were subsequently found
to be ineligible at screening (n=156) or did not respond to the invitation
letter (n=99). By April 2014, the 74 practices had identified and consented 266
eligible participants (73% of potentially eligible patients identified).

practices, GPs, practice nurses, and participants with type 2 diabetes. Of the
total sample, 248 (93%) completed the 12 month follow-up for the primary
endpoint. No differences in baseline characteristics were observed between study
completers and non-completers, except for a higher proportion of women not
completing than men (11 v 7).

Primary and secondary endpoints
Table 2 shows the primary and secondary
endpoints. At 12 months there was a statistically and clinically significant
difference between study arms in terms of change in HbA1c (mean difference:
−0.6%, 95% confidence interval −0.9% to −0.3%, P<0.001), favouring the
intervention. This is consistent with achieving our registered primary outcome
of an absolute HbA1c reduction of 0.5% in the intervention group compared with
the control group. The majority of this change in HbA1c seen in both arms was
achieved by six months (fig 2).

insulin at 12 months), whereas in the control arm, 25/115 (22%) started insulin
(24 were using insulin at 12 months). The median number of days from baseline
assessment to insulin initiation in intervention and control group patients who
started insulin was 32 (interquartile range 11.5-134.5) days and 85 (63-191)
days, respectively, (statistically significant difference: two sample Wilcoxon
rank sum test; P=0.005). In the intervention arm, 17 (11%) patients had started
rapid acting insulin at 12 months, compared with one patient in the control arm
(P<0.001). Further data on insulin use in participants are available in the
appendix files.

Target HbA1c (≤7% (53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 54 (36%) intervention
participants (32 of whom were using insulin at 12 months) and 22 (19%) control
participants (two of whom had started insulin): odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence
interval 1.2 to 4.3), P=0.02. Twenty two (15%) intervention participants and 20
(17%) control participants achieved target HbA1c without starting insulin.

At 12 months, depressive symptoms had not worsened and there was no statistically
significant difference between arms in the mean change (patient health
questionnaire-9: −1.1 (SD 3.5) v −0.1 (2.9)). There was a
statistically significant difference in mental health (AQoL mental component
summary: 0.04 (0.16) v −0.002 (0.13)), favouring the
intervention, but no significant difference in physical health (AQoL physical
component summary: 0.03 (0.15) v 0.02 (0.13)) or diabetes
specific distress (PAID: −5.6 (15.5) v −2.4 (15.4)). There was
no statistically significant difference between arms in the proportion of
participants experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms or severe
diabetes specific distress (table 2), nor was
there any difference by insulin initiation (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P=0.98). No
significant difference was found in PHQ-9, AQoL, or PAID scores when comparing
participants who started insulin with those who did not (data not shown).

At 12 months there was an average weight gain in the intervention arm and an
average weight loss in the control group (1.7 (SD 5.2) kg v
−1.1 (5.1), mean difference 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.0) kg). There
were no statistically significant differences in blood pressure or other
biochemical measures between arms at follow-up, with the exception of
triglycerides, which remained higher in the control group.

At baseline, participants were using a mean of 2.0 (SD 0.6) classes of
non-insulin hypoglycaemic agents, with no significant difference between arms
(t test, P=0.89). The majority of patients were prescribed
metformin (93% across both arms) and sulfonylureas (63% across both arms). There
was no significant difference in the prescription of individual drug classes by
study arm. The mean number of classes of non-insulin hypoglycaemic agents being
used at 12 months was higher in the control arm compared with the intervention
arm (2.3 (SD 0.1) v 1.9 (0.1); P=0.01). A higher proportion of
people in the control group used dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors than in the
intervention group at 12 months (table 3).

†At time of the trial dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors were not

Practices in the intervention arm received 183 mentoring support visits from the
study registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials (mean visits per
practice 5.2 (range 1-8)). Thirty two per cent (48/151) of participants in
intervention practices completed at least one three day, 7 point structured
blood glucose monitoring profile over the 12 month study. Practice nurses
estimated the time they spent on the study (clinical interactions with
participating patients and research tasks). On a per practice basis, 23 control
practices and 27 intervention practices reported a median of 1.5 (interquartile
range 0-3.6) hours and 18 (9-20.9) hours, respectively.

Overall, 58% of people in the control group were recruited before practice
randomisation compared with 45% in the intervention group (significant
difference P=0.033). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore whether there
was any difference at baseline between patients who were recruited before and
after randomisation of the practices. No statistically significant differences
were found. Mixed effects linear regression was used to determine the impact of
the intervention, adjusting for clustering at the practice level for each of
these groups. Treatment effect in terms of the primary outcome remained
significant in both groups (treatment effect: −0.57 (95% confidence interval
−1.1 to −0.05), P=0.03 and −0.98 (−1.49 to −0.48), P<0.001 for patients
assessed before and after randomisation, respectively).

Adverse events
No severe hypoglycaemic events (those that would require third party assistance
for recovery) or other adverse events were reported in either study arm.

Discussion
Our model of care changed clinical practice, with most participants in the
intervention arm starting insulin, producing a clinically and statistically
significant improvement in glycaemia among adults with type 2 diabetes managed in
primary care. This was despite a higher patient to GP ratio in intervention
practices, and was achieved safely, with no severe hypoglycaemic events, and without
deterioration in emotional wellbeing or health status. Our results indicate that,
with appropriate support and redesign of the practice system, insulin initiation can
become part of routine diabetes management in primary care, obviating the need to
refer to specialist services with geographical, cost, and accessibility
barriers.

Strengths and limitations of this study
A strength of our study is the robust theoretical and empirical base to our
intervention. Our pragmatic trial of a complex intervention addressed several
known barriers to overcoming delay in starting insulin treatment. For example,
an intentional component of our system redesign was reorienting the practice
nurse and registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials roles, allowing
additional time to be spent with patients, within existing resources. Other
strengths include the cluster randomised design, minimising the risk of
contamination, and our excellent rate of participant retention (93%).

Our study had limitations. Firstly, practices were randomised after the first
consenting patient was identified, raising the possibility of selection bias.
However, the balance in key patient characteristics between the study arms means
that any such bias was minimal. Secondly, while a smaller cluster size is
generally preferable in a cluster randomised trial, the relatively large
variation in the cluster sizes in our study may make statistical adjustments for
clustering less effective, in particular when the number of clusters is small.
Thirdly, our sample may not have been fully representative of the broader
population of adults with type 2 diabetes managed in primary care for whom
insulin is clinically indicated. Overall, less than 15% of our sample had severe
diabetes specific distress or moderate to severe depressive symptoms, a lower
rate than in a recent national Australian sample.32 We will explore implementation fidelity and variation
in more detail through a qualitative process evaluation in a subsequent paper.
Finally, our drugs and hypoglycaemia data were derived from GP records and
subject to the same accuracy limitations of any routinely collected clinical
dataset. Hypoglycaemia is typically underestimated33 and is likely to be under-reported in routine medical
records.34 In particular, severe
hypoglycaemia is serious but relatively rare and may not have been detected in
our study, given our sample size.

Comparison with other studies
Only two other trials have tested interventions to change clinical practice in
this way. The AIM@GP trial showed no improvement in insulin prescribing rates or
glycated haemoglobin.35 It provided
scheduled and ongoing telephone support from a specialist diabetes educator and
the option to refer patients to an offsite community pharmacist for a one hour
insulin initiation session. Our intervention differed in that it was based
completely in the familiar environs of patients’ own primary care practices,
built on existing relationships and resources (with the practice based practice
nurses), and provided an immediate pathway for the GP to delegate this clinical
task. A UK study, using a before and after evaluation design, showed improved
HbA1c (−1.4%) at six months in patients who started insulin,36 similar in magnitude to the
improvement in our study. That intervention combined education with face to face
and telephone support from a registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials
for GPs and practice nurses and involved full day, offsite training for both GPs
and practice nurses. In contrast, our intervention used a brief (60-90 minute)
onsite training session incorporated into the daily running of the practice with
flexible support from the registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials,
as required. Consistent with previous research,37 our study participants did not report worse psychological
outcomes at follow-up, suggesting that insulin treatment can be initiated in
primary care for people with type 2 diabetes without impairing their emotional
wellbeing. In fact, at 12 months, the reduction in depressive symptoms in
intervention arm participants was significantly greater than that in the control
arm. Insulin initiation (across both arms) did not affect depressive symptoms,
diabetes specific distress, or generic health status at 12 months.

Conclusions and policy and practice implications
Our pragmatic trial findings have important implications for the organisation of
healthcare and for health policy. Our model of care is based on an enhanced role
for a practice nurse and would not be feasible where primary care doctors work
in solo practice without access to a practice nurse. Nevertheless, even in high
resource settings, where the move to multidisciplinary primary healthcare teams
is growing—for example, through the growth of the Medical Home movement,38 our study suggests that simply having
access to a practice nurse will not increase the rate of appropriate insulin
initiation. To make the best use of resources, primary care workforce models
need to be developed and implemented to reorient the way specialists (registered
nurse with diabetes educator credentials and endocrinologists) offer support to
primary care teams that include well supported and resourced primary care
nurses. Changes in the role of registered nurse with diabetes educator
credentials is occurring in some health systems,38 and our study provides
evidence of the effectiveness and safety of such models of care. Rather than
waiting for referrals, specialist services need to offer proactive, tailored
secondary consultation, liaison, and mentoring services that are flexible and
supportive of the needs of primary care practitioners and patients. Scaling up
the model of care in metropolitan centres would require engaging with hospitals
and other health services in reorienting the role of registered nurse with
diabetes educator credentials currently employed in direct patient care.
Investigation of e-health modalities (for example, online training, support, and
video consultations) could support implementation of this model of care in more
distant rural or remote settings.

Our trial findings also have implications for clinical practice. The issue around
personalising glycaemic targets and treatments is an important and emerging
consideration in the care of people with type 2 diabetes. When our trial
started, there was vigorous debate about the need for caution in setting lower
targets. In addition, our exclusion criteria ruled out participants for whom a
higher target would definitely be considered. Collecting reliable data on
duration of cardiovascular disease, severe hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemic
unawareness did not prove feasible in this setting. We therefore decided to use
the general target of 7%. Debate continues about the advantages and
disadvantages of intensifying treatment for people with type 2 diabetes who have
the HbA1c levels mandated in our study. Our findings suggest that the Stepping
Up model of care builds clinical capacity within GP and practice nurse teams to
undertake the work of insulin initiation. However, the model of care did not
mandate a dogmatic approach to such changes in treatment. It is worth noting the
major change in HbA1c was achieved at six months, and that even in intervention
practices, only 35% of participants with type 2 diabetes achieved the general
HbA1c target of <7% (53 mmol/mol), suggesting that practitioners and patients
were judicious in the way they approached progressive treatment intensification,
within the new model of care.

Our clinical protocols and algorithms were focused solely on insulin. It is worth
noting that NPH (neutral protamine hagedorn) insulin remains widely used and
that the added costs of analogueue insulins where NPH can be used without
problem is still subject to debate. While we did not prespecify weight gain as a
secondary outcome, this is an adverse effect of insulin treatment and we have
chosen to report it. While insulin is still regarded as an essential treatment
option, as the range of glycaemic treatments grows, clinical algorithms become
more complex.5 Future research needs to
explore the capacity to generate recommendations for real time personalised
treatment intensification that incorporate this increasing complexity,39 to be used as part of the practice
nurse led model of care. Future research could also address the extent to which
improvements in glycaemic levels are maintained, and the extent to which the
model of care is sustained in routine clinical practice. In particular, research
could explore use of the model of care to specifically support early adoption of
insulin treatment to achieve glycaemic targets early in people with recently
diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes demands innovation in care delivery.
Delaying insulin initiation when clinically indicated is neither ethical nor
effective. Furthermore, health systems will not cope with demand if insulin
initiation remains anchored in specialist centres, nor will they be able to
respond to the imperative to achieve glycaemic targets early in people with
recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Thus our pragmatic, translational study has
important implications across health systems globally for the organisation of
care for people with type 2 diabetes. Our effective model of care has the
potential to improve outcomes while making better use of scarce healthcare
resources.

What is already known on this topic
Achieving and maintaining glycaemic targets early in type 2
diabetes improves long term outcomes

There are barriers to early stepwise progressive treatment
intensification to achieve glycaemic targets in primary care,
particularly when starting insulin

Interventions have had limited success in overcoming the delay in
starting insulin treatment and changing clinical practice, in
part because system level barriers are not addressed

What this study adds
Our model of care intervention changed clinical practice, with
more patients in intervention arm practices starting insulin,
with an overall benefit in terms of HbA1c reduction, achieved
without serious adverse events or any worsening in depressive
symptoms

The theoretical base and flexible implementation are important
characteristics of our intervention

Our model of care used existing resources and thus has important
implications for policymakers, funders, and practitioners
seeking innovative ways to provide the best care for people with
type 2 diabetes in primary care
