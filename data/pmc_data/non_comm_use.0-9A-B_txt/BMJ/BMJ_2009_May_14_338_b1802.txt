laparoscopic operation.

Design Prospective randomised controlled and blinded trial.

Setting Seven gynaecological departments in the Zeeland region of
Denmark.

Participants 24 first and second year registrars specialising in gynaecology
and obstetrics.

Interventions Proficiency based virtual reality simulator training in
laparoscopic salpingectomy and standard clinical education (controls).

Main outcome measure The main outcome measure was technical performance
assessed by two independent observers blinded to trainee and training status using a
previously validated general and task specific rating scale. The secondary outcome measure
was operation time in minutes.

Results The simulator trained group (n=11) reached a median total score of
33 points (interquartile range 32-36 points), equivalent to the experience gained after
20-50 laparoscopic procedures, whereas the control group (n=10) reached a median total
score of 23 (22-27) points, equivalent to the experience gained from fewer than five
procedures (P<0.001). The median total operation time in the simulator trained group
was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14 minutes) and in the control group was 24 (20-29)
minutes (P<0.001). The observers’ inter-rater agreement was 0.79.

Conclusion Skills in laparoscopic surgery can be increased in a clinically
relevant manner using proficiency based virtual reality simulator training. The
performance level of novices was increased to that of intermediately experienced
laparoscopists and operation time was halved. Simulator training should be considered
before trainees carry out laparoscopic procedures.

Introduction
Laparoscopy has become the standard approach for many conditions in most surgical
specialties.1
2
3 This development has been driven by the desire for
less surgical trauma, faster postoperative recovery, shorter hospital stay, and better
cosmetic results, and a sales drive by the medical industry.4 It is evident, however, that laparoscopy is associated with a longer operation
time and a higher rate of surgical complications during the learning curve of the surgeons.
This has been verified in many different specalties, including general5
6 urological,7
8 paediatric,9 and gynaecological surgery.10 The
possibility of overcoming these problems during the learning curve by appropriate training
and ensuring that surgeons perform a sufficient number of procedures has also been
documented.11 The technical skills needed for
laparoscopic surgery are fundamentally different from those for traditional open surgery,
leading to a prolonged learning curve. The primary obstacles in learning laparoscopy are
psychomotor and perceptual. The unique nature of laparoscopic surgery combined with an
increasing focus on patients’ safety and rights, the present decrease in working hours, and
concern over costs of operating theatre time are factors that challenge the traditional
surgical approach and contribute to a growing need for novel methods in the training of
laparoscopic surgeons.12 Although virtual reality
simulation has the potential to offer important advantages in the area of training for new
skills and procedures, evidence on the transfer of skills from the simulated environment to
the operating theatre is still limited.13
14

We investigated the impact of training using a virtual reality simulator on the quality of
skills acquired for a key gynaecological procedure. The investigation was carried out as a
prospective, randomised, observer blinded, controlled trial, according to the guidelines of
the consolidated standards of reporting trials (www.consort-statement.org).

Methods
From September 2006 to June 2007, 32 trainees in gynaecological specialty training years 1
and 2 (postgraduate years 3-8; see box), with no experience of advanced laparoscopy (defined
as all laparoscopic procedures involving coordination of more than one instrument), were
included in the study. Of a total cohort of 42 (38 women and four men) trainees in the
region, eight were not eligible, as they were too experienced and four came from the two
departments that did not participate in the trial. Of the remaining 30 eligible trainees,
the first 24 who volunteered were enrolled. They came from seven of nine gynaecology
departments in the Zeeland region of Denmark (population 2.3 million): Gentofte hospital
(five trainees), Herlev hospital (n=4), Roskilde hospital (n=4), Hilleroed hospital (n=1),
Holbaek hospital (n=1), Hvidovre hospital (n=2), and Rigshospitalet hospital (n=7).

Duration of specialist training in Denmark
Preregistration house year—one year

Introduction before specialist training—one year

Optional additional training to qualify for further specialisation (possibility for
writing PhD thesis)—1-3 years

Specialist training—four years

Randomisation and blinding
To ensure that the trainees’ baseline characteristics were similar within and between
each group, we chose a stratified randomisation based on previous experience of simple
laparoscopy (defined as laparoscopic procedures performed using a single instrument, such
as diagnostic laparoscopic sterilisation (clips) or diagnostic laparoscopy). The Clinical
Trial Unit at Copenhagen University independently randomised the trainees by computer to
intervention or control groups. The randomisation procedure was concealed and achieved by
using the trainees’ unique personal identification number (central personal register
number).

Trainees in the intervention group were given an oral introduction to the simulator and
the rating scale used for outcome measure. Any operations done during the study were
recorded. Owing to the nature of the trial it was not possible to blind the trainees to
their allocated group, but all involved departments, supervisors, and staff in the
operating theatres were blinded to the trainee’s group, and the assessors of outcome were
blinded to both the trainee and their allocated group. The primary investigator saw the
data only after completion of all assessments and once data had been loaded in a
database.

The control group was to continue standard clinical education. During the study no
trainee in either group was allowed to perform advanced laparoscopic surgery, only simple
laparoscopy or to assist senior colleagues. To check that randomisation had been
successful, the control group were trained in the simulator after the trial. Their
baseline performances were indistinguishable from those of the intervention group.

Equipment
The virtual reality laparoscopy simulator program (LapSim Gyn v 3.0.1; Surgical Science,
Gothenburg, Sweden) was run on an IBM T42 computer in a docking station (Pentium M 1.8
GHz/512 MB RAM; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) using an interface with a diathermy pedal (Virtual
Laparoscopic Interface; Immersion, San Jose, CA, USA). The operations took place in the
operating theatres of the participating departments and were recorded on DVD using a
camera attached to the laparoscope for later blinded evaluation. During the operation one
of the authors (CRL or designated TD) observed the procedure to record the handling of the
surgical instruments, any involvement of the supervisor, whether the standard procedure
for the operation was followed, and whether the recording was done correctly, finalised,
and assessed.

Simulator training
The intervention group undertook a specific training programme in the simulator. The
programme comprised two parts: firstly, training in the two basic skills of “lifting and
grasping” and “cutting” during which the trainees were introduced to the simulator
environment and the different instruments; secondly, one procedure specific task in which
the trainee had to carry out a complete right sided salpingectomy while preserving the
ovary. The training in basic skills was done once in each training cycle of 45-60 minutes
and the salpingectomy repeated continually during the remainder of the cycle. The
simulator provided the trainees with instant feedback on time, path length and angular
path of the instruments’ movements, bleeding, cutting of uncoagulated arteries, and use of
diathermy on non-target tissue. The training sessions were repeated until the expert
criterion level was reached in two consecutive and independent simulations. The
proficiency criteria were established by experts in previous studies of construct validity
and learning curves.15
16 The requirements and settings of the simulator
are available at www.skopisimulator.rh.dk.

Surgical procedure
The trainees performed their first salpingectomy at their local gynaecological department
and were supervised by a senior colleague who was told about the purpose of the trial. To
make comparison of performance easier, the trainees all carried out procedures on the
right side. The patients were admitted for elective salpingectomy before treatment for
infertility or for prophylactic removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries owing to a positive
test result for breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1). The trainees were not allowed to operate on
patients who had undergone previous open or laparoscopic surgery below umbilicus, had
possible abdominal malignant disease, had an American Surgical Association score ≥3
(patients with severe systemic disease), had a body mass index less than 18 or more than
27, had haemophilia, or had other factors of potential influence on the surgical
procedure. The operations followed a modified standard procedure on the basis of expert
consensus.17
18 The supervisors were allowed to give oral
instructions only, and one researcher was present to observe the procedure and to record
who handled the instruments.

Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was technical performance, measured as total score (10-50
points) using the objective structured assessment of laparoscopic salpingectomy, which
comprises a five item general rating scale and five item task specific rating scale.19 Two independent observers blinded to trainee and
allocated group assessed the recorded operations. The secondary outcome measure was
operating time in minutes. The reliability of the assessment was determined by calculating
the inter-rater agreement (number of agreements for each of the assessed items divided by
total number of assessed items) and the γ coefficient. We present outcomes as medians and
interquartile ranges.

Power calculation
The power calculation was based on a previous validation study on the procedure specific
scale of the objective structured assessment of laparoscopic salpingectomy.19 This study showed a difference of six points
between novice laparoscopists (0-5 procedures) and intermediately experienced
laparoscopists (30-50 procedures). An improvement of skills to the level of 30 or more
points was considered acceptable. On the basis of these findings we chose the minimal
relevant difference to be six points. We determined that with an α of 0.05 (two sided) and
a power of 80% (β=0.2 giving Zα=1.96 and Zβ=0.84, largest SD=4.40) we required 18 or more
trainees. To compensate for possible drop outs, we added an additional third to the 18,
totalling 24 trainees.

Statistical analysis
We present cumulated scores as medians (average score of two observers), compared using
non-parametrical analysis (Mann-Whitney U test). We considered a two tailed P value of
0.05 or less to be statistically significant and an inter-rater agreement and γ
coefficient of 0.8 or more for each to be acceptable. Analysis was done using SPSS 13.0
for Windows. Graphics were made using Graph pad Prism (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA, USA).

Results
Eight of the total cohort of 42 trainees (38 women, four men) were ineligible for the study
as they were too experienced and four came from the two departments not participating in the
trial. The remaining 30 trainees agreed to participate. The first 24 were enrolled; 22 (90%)
were women, representing the current sex distribution among trainees in obstetrics and
gynaecology in Denmark (figure). The average age of the
trainees was 32.8 years (range 26-42 years), and 23 were right handed. Eleven trainees were
randomised to virtual reality training in laparoscopic salpingectomy and 10 were randomised
to traditional clinical education. Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics of the trainees. Two trainees were subsequently excluded from the
simulator trained group because one failed to complete the training programme and the other
was involved in an operation that was cancelled because of anatomical abnormality and
suspected malignant disease in the patient. One trainee was excluded from the control group
because of a technical fault in the DVD recorder used to record the operation.

The median total time to complete the procedure was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14
minutes) in the simulator trained group compared with 24 (20-29 minutes) in the control
group (P<0.001, table 2). Twenty one operations were assessed.

The median number of simulated salpingectomies needed to reach the proficiency level in the
simulator trained group was 28 (24-32 salpingectomies). The control group was offered
simulator training after the study operation; nine of the 11 trainees in this group
volunteered and a median of 26 (23-32) simulated operations were needed to reach the
proficiency level (P=0.70). The mean time spent on training using the simulator was 7 hours
and 15 minutes (5h 30 min-8h 0 min) in the intervention group and 7 hours and 0 min (5h 15
min-7h 45 min) in the control group (P=0.65; table 3).
The baseline score (first attempt) was 8 (5-15) in the simulator trained group and 9 (7-19)
in the control group after training (P=0.70; table 3). All trends of differences in baseline
characteristics were not statistically significant.

Discussion
Proficiency based virtual reality training in laparoscopic salpingectomy compared with
standard clinical education was associated with a clinically important improvement of
operative skills during the actual procedure. The learning curve in the operating theatre
was also shorter. On the rating scale used in this study, which had previously been
validated in a separate investigation, novices (fewer than five procedures) scored a median
24 points, and intermediately experienced trainees (20-50 procedures) a median 33 points
compared with a median 39 points for experts.19 The
clinical implications of the present findings are thus extensive. After training in a
specific procedure to a predefined (proficiency based) level inexperienced trainees
progressed from the performance level of a novice to that of an intermediately experienced
gynaecologist, assessed in their first complex laparoscopic procedure. By using simulator
training it might be possible to bypass the early learning curve, which is known to be
associated with an increased rate of complications.20 This study was not designed to investigate complication rates, and conclusions
in this area must be drawn cautiously. In general it is difficult to use patient outcomes to
evaluate a medical training course. Firstly, in contrast with trials of a single
intervention (for example, a new drug) medical education is a complex intervention involving
many interconnecting parts and different layers.21
Secondly, assessment of surgical technical skills of individual trainees will need to be
based on surrogate end points rather than outcomes such as morbidity or mortality because it
is an ethical imperative that an operation performed by a supervised novice ought to have
the same outcome as that of the supervisor. Training may cost time and some inconvenience
for the patient but should never jeopardise safety or outcome. Thirdly, to show differences
in outcome, based on a training course, the numbers of trainees should by far outnumber the
total number of trainees available, thus making such a trial unfeasible.

Operating time
Although operating time might be greater with novice surgeons, the outcomes of a
supervised operation ought to be the same. The time to complete the laparoscopic
salpingectomy was reduced by half. As the operating theatre serves both productivity and
educational purposes, shorter operation times are of benefit.

The present results emphasise that by using virtual reality simulator training the
surgical community can meet the need for proficiency based basic training in laparoscopy.
These results also show that criterion based procedural training using a virtual reality
simulator can help compensate for reduced working hours by bringing trainees to a higher
level of performance more quickly. Traditional training depends on the supply of suitable
procedures for training purposes, whereas simulator training can be used according to
demand. To achieve an average of 28 salpingectomies can take a year or more in clinical
practice, compared with eight hours of intensive training using the simulator.

Finally, reducing the operating time by half, from 24 minutes in the control group to 12
minutes in the simulator trained group, might not seem important. Nevertheless it has been
estimated that during residency the additional costs of longer operating time is about
(1997) $48 000 (£31 841.00; €35 907.00) per graduate.22 For more extensive surgery or just a bilateral procedure, increased use of
simulator training could reduce novice operating time substantially, easing the pressure
on the often limited capacity for training in the operating theatre.

Transfer of skills
Despite virtual reality simulators being introduced more than a decade ago, evidence on
the effect of simulators on performance in the operating theatre is still sparse.13 To date no published studies on the transfer of
technical surgical skills from simulator to real operations had exceeded grade 2a
evidence; in our study the level of evidence is 1b. These findings are supported in a
systematic review,14 which also showed that the
randomised controlled trials on effect of simulator training were generally of poor
scientific quality. The major problems were randomisation with inadequate concealment of
allocation, lack of power calculations or insufficient sample sizes, lack of observer
blinding, insufficient training time or goals, non-standardised comparators in control
groups, and disparate interventions in intervention groups. Most studies also used
surrogate end points such as bench station or simulator tests to establish the
transferability of skills, instead of assessing skills in real operations. The conclusion
of the meta-analysis was that only few studies possess the necessary quality, that two
studies showed a positive effect23
24 (real operation) and one study no effect25 (simulated operation) of simulator based training.
Another common feature of the previous studies is that they were all carried out using
basic skills rather than procedure specific simulation. We used a procedural simulator,
which provides training in both psychomotor and cognitive skills, thereby also improving
knowledge of the surgical procedure and its potential pitfalls. There are probably several
reasons for the significant impact on both performance and time in our study compared with
previously published studies. Firstly, the simulator provides a realistic graphic
presentation of anatomy in the surgical field and a good feedback system enabling the
trainees to adjust their performance. Secondly, using predefined training goals (the
expert proficiency level) instead of fixed time or numbers, encouraged the trainees to
rehearse until they reached the maximal effect of the simulator training. Thirdly, instead
of selecting medical students who might not choose a surgical career, we studied highly
motivated trainees who needed to learn laparoscopic skills for the future.

We measured the impact of simulator training on a salpingectomy, which is an important
gynaecological laparoscopic procedure and can be viewed as a key operation possessing all
the core skills needed for most laparoscopic procedures. We did not test external validity
and reproducibility beyond the specialty of gynaecology. However the skills that were
improved can probably be considered as genuine core skills, which would be beneficial
across the surgical specialties.

The flow of an operation is based on both technical skills and knowledge of the
procedure, and therefore we expect the impact of simulator training would apply to other
laparoscopic procedures, although the effect would be more visible on the technical side
than in the knowledge of procedural skills. These suppositions are supported by a
contemporary Swedish study on procedural virtual reality simulator training of
cholecystectomy, which reached conclusions similar to those of the present study.26

Observer reliability
In the present study the γ coefficient showed that there was no systematic discrepancy
among the raters. The inter-rater agreement also reached a sufficient level, which is
evidence of a valid and reliable assessment.

The investigation was carried out in the same way that a curriculum integrated training
course most likely would be implemented. The internal consistency of the trial could have
been higher if all the trainees had operated in the same theatre, using the same technical
equipment, and with the same supervisor and staff. However, by showing the effects of
simulator training in settings closely resembling a regional simulator training course the
external validity was improved. The primary investigator helped the trainee to use the
simulator and introduced the different training modules but did not teach laparoscopic
techniques. The feedback on performance was based on assessment in the simulator. A
designated supporter at the training session could, however, be a source of bias. A
setting where trainees practise by themselves could eliminate this potential source of
bias. Finally, performing laparoscopic surgery also consists of identifying diseased
anatomy, communication, teamwork, decision making,27 and leadership, alternative plans, and conversion to open surgery if
needed.28
29 These non-technical skills are taught in the
currently existing virtual reality systems to a limited degree only. In this study we did
not provide training in these non-technical skills or assess them. Simulator training
should probably be considered only as a supplement or preoperative training; further
education and practice in the operating theatre as well as further development of more
complex virtual surgical environments (hybrid simulation)30 is still required.

Conclusion
It is possible to transfer skills acquired during proficiency based training using a
virtual reality simulator to a real operation. Training in proficiency based skills should
be incorporated in a comprehensive surgical training and assessment curriculum for all
residents before they operate on real patients. This can potentially improve patients’
safety and improve efficiency in the operating theatre.
