10.1136/bmj.j3887What is the role of a single dose of oral corticosteroids for those with acute sore
throat? Using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process,
an expert panel make a weak recommendation in favour of corticosteroid use. The panel
produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review triggered by a
large randomised trial published in April 2017. This trial reported that
corticosteroids increased the proportion of patients with complete resolution of pain
at 48 hours. Box 1 shows all of the articles and evidence linked in this Rapid
Recommendation package. The infographic provides the recommendation together with an
overview of the absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids in the standard GRADE
format. Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged since the publication of

What you need to know:
Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for primary care appointments,
and international guidance varies about whether to use corticosteroids to treat
it, but a trial published in April 2017 suggested that costicosteroids might be
effective

We make a weak recommendation to use a single dose of oral corticosteroids, in
those presenting with acute sore throat, after performing a systematic review
of the new evidence in this rapid recommendation publication package

The recommendation is weak and shared decision making is needed because
corticosteroids did not help all patient reported outcomes and patients’
preferences varied substantially

Steroids somewhat reduced the severity and duration of pain by one day, but
time off school or work was unchanged. Harm seems unlikely with one steroid
dose.

The treatment is inexpensive and likely to be offered in the context of a
consultation that would have taken place anyway

Expanded version of the results with multilayered recommendations,
evidence summaries, and decision aids for use on all devices

Acute sore throat is defined as pain in the throat for less than 14 days. Acute sore throat
could be caused by pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, or
retropharyngeal abscess. Some patients with sore throat also experience headache, fever,
muscle stiffness, cough, and general malaise.

Acute sore throat is common, but only a minority of patients will visit their general
practitioner.1 A survey reported that the main
reasons are to establish the cause of the symptoms, obtain pain relief, and to gain
information on the course of the disease.2 Data
from Dutch and Flemish primary care databases show that, for every 1000 consecutive
patients consulting a general practitioner, 50 present with an acute sore throat.3
4 In the US, more than 92 million visits by adults
to primary care practices and emergency departments between 1997 and 2010 were
recorded.5 Sore throat presenting as acute
tonsillitis is also the commonest cause for emergency admission to otorhinolaryngology
services in the US.6


Acute sore throat is a self limiting disease and typically resolves after 7-10 days in
adults and 2-7 days in children.7 Most infections
are of viral origin; only a few are caused by a bacterial infection, of which group A
β-haemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella
catarrhalis are the most common pathogens. Evidence suggests that the time to
resolution is not associated with the type of pathogen.7 About 2% of patients initially presenting with sore throat will have a
mononucleosis infection caused by an Epstein-Barr virus, which could prolong the duration
of symptoms.8


Some patients experience unacceptable morbidity and inconvenience, and miss school or work
due to recurrent sore throat.9 Pain is a common
reason for work or school absence. Complications of sore throat are rare: about 0.2% of
patients with tonsillitis will develop a peritonsillar abscess.10


The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical
prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a
bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.11
12


Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment.13 The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few,
and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are
probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses,
but may help those with a bacterial infection.14
15 Recommended management of sore throat varies
widely, and table 1 summarises current guidelines.

How the recommendation was created
A large randomised controlled trial published in April 201721 found that corticosteroids increased the proportion of
patients with complete resolution of symptoms at 48 hours. However, corticosteroids
did not seem to decrease the duration of moderately bad symptoms, pain severity,
healthcare attendance, days missed from school or work, or the consumption of delayed
antibiotics. This study adds to the body of evidence that suggests that, although
corticosteroids probably have benefits in patients with sore throat, these benefits
may be modest.22
23
24
25 The Rapid Recommendations team felt that
the study, when considered in context of the full body of evidence, might change
practice.26


Our international panel—including general practitioners, general internists,
paediatricians, an otorhinolaryngologist, epidemiologists, methodologists,
statisticians, and people with lived experience of sore throat—decided what was the
scope of the recommendation and the outcomes that are most important to patients.
After a parallel team conducted a systematic review on the benefits and harms of
corticosteroids,16 and a systematic
search for evidence about patients’ values and preferences (appendix 1 on bmj.com),
the panel met to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. No person had
financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were
minimised and managed (appendix 2 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for
creating a trustworthy recommendation,26
27 including using the GRADE approach to
critically appraise the evidence and create recommendations (appendix 3 on
bmj.com).28 The panel considered the
balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of the drug, the quality of the evidence for
each outcome, typical and expected variations in patient values and preferences, and
acceptability.29 Recommendations can be
strong or weak, for or against a course of action.

The evidence
The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to
standard care in patients with acute sore throat.16


Figure 1 gives an overview of the number and types of
patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of
the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.


Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic
review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the
recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain
severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms,
duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies
reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable
symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of
pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain
and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they
accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were
enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore
confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused
in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of
all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years
old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent
episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the
evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them.
Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or
intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

Understanding the recommendation
The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the
modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute
sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat,
patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics,
patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the
emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review
contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were
consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials
of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care
offices.16


Absolute benefits and harms
Although the evidence indicates that the treatment works on average, it did not
reduce the severity of pain dramatically and failed to improve several other
patient-important outcomes.

The infographic explains the recommendation and provides an overview (GRADE summary
of findings) of the absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids. Estimates of
baseline risk for effects come from the control arms of the trials.16 The infographic also leads to point-of-care
formats in the MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support
shared decision making with patients.17


Considering the evidence and its certainty, the panel was confident that:

Corticosteroids increase the chance of complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48
hours, reduce the severity of pain, and shorten the time to onset of pain
relief (GRADE high to moderate quality evidence)

Corticosteroids are unlikely to reduce recurrence or relapse of symptoms or
days missed from school or work (GRADE moderate quality evidence)

A single dose of corticosteroids is unlikely to cause serious adverse
events

The randomised trials did not report any major event attributable to
single dose corticosteroids (GRADE moderate quality evidence)

The panel also considered evidence from observational studies that used
higher doses of steroids. A large retrospective US cohort study of
private insurance claims assessed adverse events in 327 452 adults who
received an outpatient prescription of corticosteroids.18 There was a small absolute
increase in the rate of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture in
the first 30 days (GRADE low quality evidence, due to suboptimal
verification of diagnosis in large databases and confounding by
indication19). The panel
agreed that such events seemed unlikely with single dose steroids

Similarly, among paediatric populations, indirect evidence from a
meta-analysis of 44 randomised trials did not report any major adverse
events in patients with conditions requiring a short course of
corticosteroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, wheeze, and
pharyngitis or tonsillitis)20


There are no differences in the relative effects of corticosteroids (when
compared with usual care) between primary care settings and emergency
departments

It is unlikely that new information will change interpretation for outcomes
that are high to moderate quality of evidence.

The panel was less confident about whether:

Corticosteroids reduced antibiotic use, due to a lack of improvement or
worsening of symptoms in patients not prescribed antibiotics immediately when
consulting the physician (GRADE low quality evidence)

Corticosteroids reduced the average time to complete resolution of pain (GRADE
low quality evidence).

Values and preferences
The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest
reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement,
and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain
at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and
preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak
recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may
be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have
higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very
important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are
compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children’s pain, or patients
experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain
severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important.
However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain,
the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes.
Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as
patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to
accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel
had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that
is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients,
practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe
diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients’ values and preferences related
to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and
abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two
provided relevant information on patients’ values and preferences (see appendix 1 on
bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by
the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes
and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore
throat management.

Practical issues and other considerations
Figure 2 outlines the key practical issues for
patients and clinicians discussing adjunct steroids for sore throat, which are also
accessible along with the evidence as decision aids to support shared decision-making
in MAGICapp. Steroids are typically given as 10 mg dexamethasone (or adapted to
weight for children: 0.6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 10 mg), typically taken as
pill or intramuscular injection.


Fig2 Practical issues about use of corticosteroids to treat acute
sore throat

The risks may outweigh the benefits when larger cumulative doses of corticosteroids
are given to patients who experience multiple episodes of sore throat, either through
multiple visits or for patients who self medicate if prescribed more than one pill
for their previous episode. To mitigate this issue, clinicians should administer the
medication in office if possible or prescribe only one dose per visit.

Costs and resources
The panel focused on the patient perspective rather than that of society when
formulating the recommendation. Given the low cost of corticosteroids for treating
sore throat, implementation of this recommendation is unlikely to have an important
impact on the costs for health funders. The treatment is inexpensive and likely to be
offered in the context of a consultation that would have taken place anyway.
Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether it may increase the proportion of patients
visiting a doctor to get a prescription of corticosteroids.

Uncertainties for future research
Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines include:

Are there any severe adverse effects of using one-dose of steroids for treating
sore throat?

What are the effects of corticosteroids, in addition to standard care, in patients
with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat?

Updates to this article
Table 2 shows evidence which has emerged since the
publication of this article. As new evidence is published, a group will assess the new
evidence and make a judgment on to what extent it is expected to alter the
recommendation.

Education in practice
How do you currently approach giving advice for those with acute sore
throat? Do you consider offering corticosteroids?

The recommendation for corticosteroid use is weak, and patient’s preferences
are likely to vary. What information could you share with your patient to
help reach a decision together?

Have you learnt one thing from this article that might alter how you consult
with patients with sore throat? How might you share this information with
colleagues to learn together?

To what extent do you practice shared decision making for such
preference-sensitive decisions?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article
Five people with lived experience of sore throat were full panel members. These
panel members identified important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and
preferences. These patient representatives agreed that while small reductions in
pain severity and time to complete pain resolution (for example 12 compared to 24
hours) were important to them, these values may not be shared by all patients;
they expected moderate to great variability in how much importance other patients
would place in small reductions in pain. These panel members participated in the
teleconferences and email discussions and met all authorship criteria.
