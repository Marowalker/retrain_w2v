A technical error led to one of the subheadings in table 1 of this paper by Mohammed A Mohammed and colleagues slipping up the table into the wrong position (BMJ 2009;338:b780, doi:10.1136/bmj.b780). The first heading, “Age (per 10 year age group)”, should in fact appear mid-way down the “Emergency admission” section, above the row that starts “April 2005 to March 2006.”  This affects only the full text online version.
