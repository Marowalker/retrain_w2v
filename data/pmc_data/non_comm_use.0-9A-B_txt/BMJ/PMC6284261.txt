Objective To examine the effect of surgeon sex on postoperative outcomes
of patients undergoing common surgical procedures.


Design Population based, retrospective, matched cohort study from 2007
to 2015.


Setting Population based cohort of all patients treated in Ontario,
Canada.


Participants Patients undergoing one of 25 surgical procedures performed
by a female surgeon were matched by patient age, patient sex, comorbidity, surgeon
volume, surgeon age, and hospital to patients undergoing the same operation by a male
surgeon.


Interventions Sex of treating surgeon.


Main outcome measure The primary outcome was a composite of death,
readmission, and complications. We compared outcomes between groups using generalised
estimating equations.


Results 104 630 patients were treated by 3314 surgeons, 774 female and
2540 male. Before matching, patients treated by female doctors were more likely to be
female and younger but had similar comorbidity, income, rurality, and year of
surgery. After matching, the groups were comparable. Fewer patients treated by female
surgeons died, were readmitted to hospital, or had complications within 30 days (5810
of 52 315, 11.1%, 95% confidence interval 10.9% to 11.4%) than those treated by male
surgeons (6046 of 52 315, 11.6%, 11.3% to 11.8%; adjusted odds ratio 0.96, 0.92 to
0.99, P=0.02). Patients treated by female surgeons were less likely to die within 30
days (adjusted odds ratio 0.88; 0.79 to 0.99, P=0.04), but there was no significant
difference in readmissions or complications. Stratified analyses by patient,
physician, and hospital characteristics did not significant modify the effect of
surgeon sex on outcome. A retrospective analysis showed no difference in outcomes by
surgeon sex in patients who had emergency surgery, where patients do not usually
choose their surgeon.


Conclusions After accounting for patient, surgeon, and hospital
characteristics, patients treated by female surgeons had a small but statistically
significant decrease in 30 day mortality and similar surgical outcomes (length of
stay, complications, and readmission), compared with those treated by male surgeons.
These findings support the need for further examination of the surgical outcomes and
mechanisms related to physicians and the underlying processes and patterns of care to
improve mortality, complications, and readmissions for all patients.
==== Body
What is already known on this topic
Female and male physicians differ in their practice of medicine in ways that might
substantially affect patient outcomes. Outcomes after surgery depend on the technical
and cognitive skills of treating physicians, so findings from medical specialties
might not apply to surgical specialties.

What this study adds
This large, population based, matched cohort analysis found small differences in
surgical outcomes between patients treated by female and male surgeons, with the
former having a small but statistically significant decreased risk of short term
postoperative death.

Introduction
Successful surgical practice has four core components: knowledge, communication skills,
judgment, and technical proficiency.1 The
acquisition and maintenance of technical skills distinguishes surgeons from many other
doctors, and these skills are directly associated with short term postoperative
outcomes.2 Women and men practise medicine
differently,3
4

6
7 although little research exists on the
differences in learning styles, acquisition of skills, or outcomes for female and male
surgeons.8 Tsugawa et al found that
beneficiaries of US Medicare that were treated by female general internists in hospital
had lower rates of 30 day mortality and readmission than those treated by male
internists.9 Suggested mechanisms for this
difference include female doctors being more likely to use a patient centred approach
and to follow evidence based guidelines. Surgery, however, has a major technical
component, so there is less reason to expect a difference in outcomes between female and
male surgeons.

Surgical disciplines are disproportionately male despite increasing numbers of female
medical students.3

7 Gender equity in the surgical profession,
including disparities in compensation and promotion, is a growing concern.10
11 Assessing outcomes for female and male
surgeons is important for combatting implicit bias and gender schemas that might
perpetuate current inequalities.10 We sought to
determine whether postoperative outcomes for patients having one of 25 surgical
procedures (emergent and elective) differ between male and female operating surgeons
using a large, population based cohort.

Methods
Overview
We conducted a population based, retrospective cohort study of patients having
surgical procedures in Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2015
to assess the hypothesis that sex of the operating surgeon would significantly affect
30 day postoperative outcomes. The study sample included patients who had one of 25
surgical interventions, selected by multidisciplinary discussion with consultants
from all surgical specialties. We selected surgical procedures using the following
criteria: inclusion of all surgical subspecialties with female surgeons12 and either frequently performed in
Ontario13 or having an increased
likelihood of complications. We selected coronary artery bypass grafting,
femoral-popliteal bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, appendectomy,
cholecystectomy, gastric bypass, colon resection, liver resection, hysterectomy,
anterior or posterior spinal decompression, anterior or posterior spinal arthrodesis,
craniotomy for brain tumour, total knee replacement, total hip replacement, open
repair of femoral neck or shaft fracture, total thyroidectomy, neck dissection, lung
resection, radical cystectomy, radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of
prostate, carpal tunnel release, and breast reduction.

Despite using administrative data sources, we performed a sample size calculation to
ensure that the proposed analysis was feasible. Based on previous estimates of the
study primary outcome (composite event rate of death, readmission, and postoperative
complications; 17%)14and effect size (4%, or
odds ratio 0.96),9 we calculated a necessary
sample size of 94 270 (see appendix). We designed and conducted this study according
to STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology)
guidelines15 and the RECORD (reporting of
studies conducted using observational routinely collected health data)
statement.11 Sunnybrook Health Sciences
Centre Research Ethics Board approved this study (project identification number
375-2016).

Data sources
We linked the following datasets using encrypted patient identifiers: the Ontario
Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database, which tracks claims paid for physician
billings, laboratories, and out-of-province providers16; the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge
Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD), which contains records for hospital admissions17; the CIHI National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System, which contains records for emergency department visits; the Registered
Persons Database for demographic information18; and the Corporate Provider Database for surgeon data.

Cohort derivation
We identified all patients who had one of the 25 index procedures in the study period
(n=1 534 592). We excluded patients treated by physicians whose primary declared
specialty was non-surgical (n=8753) and patients under 18 (n=29 158). We included
only the first one of the 25 procedures for each patient, thus excluding 282 399
procedures in patients already in the cohort and ensuring that each patient was
included only once. We excluded patients for whom the date of death preceded the date
of surgery (n=332). We think these cases represent coding errors as the majority died
several years before the date of surgery. A sensitivity analysis including the 10
patients who died one day before surgery did not alter the outcome of the primary
analysis (see appendix). To capture data on hospital factors, we excluded patients
for whom the treating institution could not be identified (n=54 263). After these
exclusions, the study sample comprised 1 159 687 patients who had surgery between
2007 and 2015.

Outcomes
Our primary outcome was a composite of death, complications, or readmission (to any
hospital in the province of Ontario) in the 30 days after surgery, as previously
described.16 We included deaths that
occurred in the initial postoperative period in hospital. We think this outcome best
captures the overall burden of short term postoperative complications. Our secondary
outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome (death, complications,
and readmission within 30 days of surgery), and length of stay in hospital. We used a
definition of surgical complications that has previously been used and represents
major morbidity.16 These outcomes were
ascertained from health administrative data using a combination of procedural and
diagnostic codes that are uniformly collected for all hospitals and patients in
Ontario.14
19


Covariates
We collected patient age at surgery, geographic location (local health integration
networks20), sex, socioeconomic status
(based on geographic location), rurality, and general comorbidity according to the
Johns Hopkins aggregate disease group score (ADG)21 from linked administrative databases. The ADG score discriminates
better than the Charlson score.22 We
identified data on the treating surgeons including age, sex, years in practice,
specialty, and surgical volume. Surgeon sex refers to biological sex, as reported by
physicians at the time of registering for licenses to practise medicine in the
province of Ontario. Patients’ biological sex is captured in the Registered Persons
Database, which we used for demographic information. We were, therefore, unable to
identify transgendered patients or surgeons. To determine surgical volume, for each
patient and for the specific procedure they had, we identified the number of
identical procedures their operating surgeon performed in the previous year. We
defined this variable categorically into quarters for each procedure performed, among
the whole cohort. We collected hospital institution identifiers to account for
variability between institutions. We defined a surgical procedure as emergent or
elective using the CIHI-DAD database admission variables, which denote urgent,
emergent, or admission from the emergency department before surgery. We considered
all same day surgery procedures to be elective.

Matching
Surgeon age, years in practice, operative volumes, surgical specialty, and patient
demographics differed between participants treated by female and male surgeons, so we
conducted a matched analysis. Variables such as surgeon age could potentially
confound the relationship between surgeon sex and outcomes, as male surgeons were
older on average. Far fewer patients were treated by female surgeons, so we
identified these first and matching them to patients treated by male surgeons. We
matched patients 1:1 using a hard match comprising procedural fee code (a unique
identifier for each procedure), surgeon volume (separated into quarters based on the
number of index procedures performed by each surgeon in the year before index),
surgeon age (±3 years), hospital identifier, patient age (±5 years), patient sex, and
patient comorbidity using ADG score (categorical). Surgeon years in practice was
collinear with surgeon age, so we selected only age for matching. We selected all
covariates for matching based on a priori identification without variable
selection.

Statistical analysis
In all analyses we examined surgeon sex as an exposure potentially associated with
postoperative outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used to compare patients treated
by male and female physicians, as well as to compare the characteristics of the male
and female surgeons. Given the large sample size, traditional statistical measures
were likely to show statistically significant differences where no clinically
important differences exist. So we compared groups using standardised differences—the
difference in the mean of a variable between two groups divided by an estimate of the
standard deviation of that variable among both groups.23 We defined a clinically important standardised difference as
greater than 0.10.23


Matched data are inherently correlated, so we used multivariable generalised
estimating equations (GEE) with a logit link to estimate the association between
surgeon sex and the outcomes. We used Poisson regression to examine the association
between surgeon sex and hospital length of stay.

We conducted subgroup analyses to assess for an interaction between patient (age,
sex, and comorbidity), surgeon (specialty, age, years in practice, and annual
volume), and hospital characteristics and to assess the association between surgeon
sex and outcomes. To minimise the effect of patients selecting their physician, we
performed a retrospective stratified analysis of the matched cohort according to
whether the surgery was elective or emergent.

Matching considerably reduced our sample size, which might adversely affect the
applicability of our findings. Thus, we examined the entire cohort (n=1 159 687)
using regression with multivariable GEE models with a logit link, rather than
matching, to account for differences in patient, surgeon, and hospital factors
between patients treated by female and male surgeons. The GEE model accounted for
correlation in outcomes based on surgeon, hospital, and procedural fee code.

Statistical significance was set at P<0.05 based on a two tailed comparison. We
used SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) for all
analyses.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures,
nor were they involved in developing plans for implementation of the study. No
patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are
no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the
relevant patient community. Individual patient consent was not sought given the use
of anonymised administrative data.

Results
We identified 1 159 687 eligible patients who had one of the 25 index procedures in the
study period. Surgery was performed by 3314 surgeons, 774 (23.4%) of whom were female,
and 2540 (76.6%) were male (table 1). Of the
1 159 687 patients, 144 119 (12.4%) were treated by female surgeons, and 1 015 568
(87.6%) were treated by male surgeons. Patients treated by female physicians were more
likely to be female and younger (table 1). We found
no difference in year of surgery, comorbidity, income, rurality, or region of residence
between groups. Female surgeons were younger and had fewer years in practice. Surgeon
volume (based on the number of identical surgical procedures that surgeon had performed
in the preceding year) was lower for female surgeons. Female surgeons performed
proportionally more operations than men in general surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology,
and plastic surgery. Before matching, patients treated by female surgeons had
statistically significantly lower rates of the composite endpoint (15 731 of 144 119,
10.9%, 10.8% to 11.1%) than those treated by male surgeons (122 468 of 1 015 568, 12.1%,
12.0% to 12.1%; unadjusted odds ratio 0.94, 0.91 to 0.97, P<0.001).

After matching, the two groups were well balanced with respect to patient age, sex,
comorbidity, rurality, and income; surgeon age, years in practice, annual volume of the
index procedure, and specialty; and hospital type. More patients treated by female
surgeons had their operation in later calendar years, although the difference was not
clinically important (standardized difference <0.10).

Differences in surgical specialty, procedural volume, and age of female surgeons meant
that patients who were successfully matched to male surgeons (and, thus, included in the
primary analytical cohort) were treated by younger surgeons with less experience and
lower annual volumes than those who were excluded (supplementary table 2). Included
patients were more likely to have had general surgery or an obstetrics and gynaecology
related procedure and less likely to have had neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, or a
urology related procedure. Included patients were younger and more likely to be female;
comorbidity did not differ (supplementary table 2).

In the matched cohort, the primary outcome of death, readmission, or complications
occurred in 5810 of 52 315 (11.1%, 10.9% to 11.4%) patients treated by female surgeons
and in 6046 of 52 315 (11.6%, 11.3% to 11.8%) patients treated by male surgeons (table
2), translating to an absolute difference of 0.43%
(number needed to treat to prevent one event=230).

In GEE models accounting for the correlation between matched individuals, patients
treated by female surgeons were significantly less likely to experience the composite
outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.96, 0.92 to 0.99, P=0.02). Among the secondary outcomes,
patients treated by female surgeons had a significantly lower likelihood of death within
30 days of surgery (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 0.79 to 0.99, P=0.04) and comparable
likelihood of readmission to hospital (0.96, 0.91 to 1.02, P=0.20) or complications
(0.96, 0.92 to 1.01, P=0.10). Median length of stay was two days (interquartile range
0-4 days), regardless of the sex of the treating physician. As the mean duration of
hospital admission differed among patients treated by female surgeons and those treated
by male surgeons (mean 3.9 days (SD 10.0) and mean 4.0 days (SD 11.1), respectively),
this was statistically significant in adjusted models (table 2).

We performed a retrospective sensitivity analysis of all outcomes in the matched cohort,
stratifying by elective or emergent surgery. Patients who had emergent procedures were
less likely to be female and more likely to have these procedures performed by younger
surgeons with lower surgical volumes who had practiced for a shorter period of time
(supplementary table 3). Specialties wherein emergent procedures are common (such as
general surgery) were proportionately more represented than those where it is uncommon
(such as obstetrics and gynaecology and plastic surgery), as expected. Emergent
procedures were not more or less likely to be performed by a female surgeon. Using GEE
models accounting for the correlation between matched individuals, patients treated by
female surgeons were significantly less likely to experience the composite outcome when
the procedure was elective (adjusted odds ratio 0.94, 0.89 to 0.98, P=0.007) but not
emergent (adjusted odds ratio 1.01, 0.96 to 1.08, P=0.636); Pinteraction=0.048). We did
not find any evidence of statistically significant effect modification by the urgency of
the procedure for secondary outcomes, except length of stay (supplementary table 4).

We found no significant evidence of effect modification when analyses were stratified
according to surgical specialty, surgeon age, surgeon years in practice, annual surgical
volume of the index procedure, hospital status (academic or community), patient sex,
patient age, or patient comorbidity (fig 1).

readmission, or complications) among patients treated by female and male surgeons,
stratified by physician, patient, and hospital factors

Although the effect estimates remained relatively consistent, many comparisons were no
longer statistically significant in these subgroup analyses; for example, differences
based on surgical specialty were not statistically significant (P=0.17). Given the
dramatic effect of surgeon sex on outcomes of plastic surgical procedures (fig 1; GEE regression model adjusted odds ratio 0.24, 0.17 to
0.36, supplementary table 5), we repeated our primary analysis excluding plastic
surgery. The direction and magnitude of the adjusted relative effects were unchanged
(adjusted odds ratio of composite outcome 0.963, 0.928 to 0.999, P=0.045; adjusted odds
ratio of mortality 0.886, 0.787 to 0.998, P=0.0465).

Matching considerably reduced our sample size, which might adversely affect the
extrapolation of these findings to our entire patient cohort. In regression based models
to account for confounding, patients treated by female surgeons had a comparably lower
likelihood of the composite primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.96, 0.93 to 0.99,
P=0.006); the other findings, including mortality, were also comparable to the matched
analysis (supplementary table 5). Notably, the year of surgery was not significantly
associated with primary outcome in the regression analysis.

To explore the degree to which case-mix variation and surgical volume affected the study
conclusions, we examined outcomes in regression models with sequentially greater numbers
of covariates. We clustered observations based on the procedural fee code for each model
to compare patients undergoing the same operation. Comparing patients treated by female
surgeons to those treated by male surgeons, in unadjusted models, the crude odds ratio
of the composite endpoint was 0.94 (0.91 to 0.97, P=0.0004). It remained 0.94 (0.90 to
0.97, P=0.0002) after accounting for surgeon age. Finally, we accounted for case-mix and
all variables except for surgical volume, and the difference between female and male
surgeons became non-significant (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.94 to 1.00, P=0.08).

Discussion
Principal findings
In this population based cohort, we found small but significant differences in
postoperative complications (mortality, complications, and readmission) between
patients treated by male and female surgeons, using an α criterion of 0.05. Patients
treated by female surgeons had lower rates of 30 day mortality. We matched patients
for age, sex, and general comorbidity that had the same surgical procedure by a
female or male surgeon of the same age with comparable annual surgical volume in the
same hospital. Male surgeons in this cohort had higher average procedural volumes,
which mitigates some of the effect of surgeon sex. Outcomes adjusted for case-mix
(without adjustment for surgical volume) were comparable for patients treated by
female and male surgeons. Retrospective analyses showed that the effect of surgeon
sex was restricted to patients who had elective operations; outcomes did not differ
among patients who had emergent operations. This finding must be interpreted within
the limitations of retrospective analyses.24


A large proportion of patients were excluded because of the inability to find a
suitable match. This was most prominent among patients who had procedures in
specialties dominated by men. But regression models accounting for baseline
differences with adjustment rather than matching gave comparable results for the same
outcomes of interest. This indicates that the matched analytic approach might provide
results that can be generalised.

We found an association between improved 30 day postoperative outcomes and female
surgeons, but whether these differences would persist for long term survival is
unclear. We focused on short term outcomes, as others have previously done,16
17 because technical factors related to the
surgeon are more likely to contribute to complications in the immediate postoperative
period rather than to long term surgical outcomes.8
20


We don’t know the mechanism that underlies better outcomes for patients treated by
female surgeons, although it might be related to delivery of care that is more
congruent with guidelines, more patient centred, and involves superior
communication.1

5 We found that improved postoperative
outcomes for patients treated by female surgeons were restricted to patients who had
elective operations, which might reflect better patient selection for surgery or
residual confounding. Other possible explanations include a willingness to
collaborate by female surgeons, which might avert scenarios that could otherwise
result in the “failure to rescue” phenomenon.25 In a relatively small cohort of medical students (n=342), Lou et al
found that female students completed tests of basic surgical skills more efficiently
and had significantly higher scores on tests of theoretical surgical knowledge than
men.26 Further study is required to
understand how differences in medical practice, clinical acumen, technical
skills,27 or risk taking behaviour28 could underlie the sex based differences in
mortality that we found, with a view to improving outcomes for patients treated by
physicians of either sex.

The confidence intervals of the effect estimate approach might represent residual
confounding or be due to chance alone. Our retrospective analyses of emergent
operations, where patients are less likely able to select or be biased towards a
surgeon of a particular sex, partly support the possibility of confounding. We found
that the benefit in composite outcome for patients treated by female surgeons was
restricted to elective procedures. By contrast, patients treated by female surgeons
did not have a lower rate of 30 day mortality for either elective or emergent
procedures, although this subanalysis had lower power than our main analysis.
Regardless, outcomes for patients treated by female surgeons were never worse than
for those treated by male surgeons.

The Canadian healthcare system is entirely publicly funded, which must be considered
when interpreting these results. Patients can freely choose their operating surgeon,
so factors such as lower marketing at patients might lower the likelihood of patients
“shopping around” for surgeons compared with other healthcare systems.29
30
31 Whether factors such as this affect the
likelihood of selection bias whereby “favourable” patients preferentially seek female
surgeons in Canada is unknown.

Women undertaking a surgical career experience barriers in training and in
practice.21
22 Previous work has shown that the
“surgical personality,” surgical culture, and sex based discrimination, as well as
lifestyle factors and workload, are deterrents for women considering a career in
surgery.23
24 Difficulty identifying mentors, owing to
the lack of women in leadership positions in surgery,26
32 might exacerbate this problem. These
barriers might create a higher standard for women to gain entrance into the surgical
workforce than men, resulting in the selection of a cohort of women that are
proportionately more skilled, motivated, and harder working.

Strengths and limitations of this study
We were able to comprehensively capture patients undergoing the selected surgical
procedures because of single payer healthcare in Ontario. Unlike Tsugawa et al, who
were limited to Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older, we identified all
adult patients who had the procedures of interest. This is particularly important
because patients treated by female physicians were younger than those treated by male
surgeons. Moreover, the nature of the healthcare system enabled us to capture
readmissions and complications occurring anywhere in the province, including at
hospitals other than where the index surgery was performed.

The observational nature of our study carries some limitations. Primarily, we are
unable to account for unmeasured (and unmeasurable) residual confounding. Differences
in socioeconomics and comorbidity, which were not measured by our data sources, might
have contributed to our findings. We used hard matching to directly compare outcomes
between patients treated by female and male surgeons, but within group heterogeneity
from the categorical definitions of surgical volume and comorbidity might have caused
residual confounding. Finally, we did not have information on the severity of the
diseases for which surgery was performed (for example, cancer stage) or case
complexity, though procedures were matched directly.

Comparison with other studies
The association between sex of treating physician and patient mortality has now been
assessed in three settings—after surgery, among older patients admitted to an
internal medicine service,6 and in outpatient
care.27 Jerant et al found no association
between the treating physician’s sex and mortality in an outpatient setting,27 but their study was conducted in a smaller
cohort (roughly 20 000) of relatively healthy patients. By contrast, Tsugawa et al
found small, but meaningful, differences in mortality based on sex of the treating
physician.

Conclusions and implications
Using a comprehensive sample of patients undergoing a broad range of surgeries in all
relevant specialties in Ontario, Canada, we found small differences in postoperative
outcomes between patients treated by female and male surgeons, with those treated by
female surgeons having a statistically significantly lower rate of 30 day
mortality.

Although the relative difference in mortality is quite modest (4%), it has
potentially significant clinical implications. Tsugawa et al found a 4% relative risk
reduction in mortality for patients treated by female internists, compared with those
treated by male internists.6 In our primary
matched analysis, we found a similar 4% relative lower likelihood of the composite
outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.96) and a 12% lower likelihood of 30 day mortality
(adjusted odds ratio 0.88) among patients treated by female surgeons.

That physician sex might have a greater effect on mortality rates in patients having
surgery than those treated by internists is not surprising. Outcomes after surgery
are probably more dependent on individual physician actions than those admitted to
general internal medicine departments, which, proportionally, might depend more on
patient characteristics. Moreover, much of the care provided by an inpatient internal
medicine service is performed by a team.33
Tsugawa et al identified the primary treating physician as the individual who billed
the largest proportion of services, which, on average, represented half of each
patient’s billings.6 By contrast, although
residents, fellows, hospitalists, and nurses participate in the operative and
postoperative care of patients having surgery, the primary surgeon has a direct
effect on patient outcomes. This has been found when assessing the effect of surgeon
volume,34 specialisation,35 and skill.2 Surgeons are not completely independent of teams, so the differences we
found could not only reflect differences in surgeon sex but also how they use the
resources available to them (such as other consultants or intensive care units).
Because we compared surgeons at the same hospital, who shared the same resources,
mortality differences are less likely to be related to system or team based factors.
The buffering effect of surgical teams should result in a bias towards the null. So
the effect we observed might be an underestimate of the true effect.

These results do not support the preferential selection of a surgeon of either sex in
clinical practice. Rather they indicate the need for further study in independent
cohorts using different research methods. In addition, they support the examination
of surgical outcomes and mechanisms related to physicians and the underlying
processes and patterns of care to improve mortality, complications, and readmissions
for all patients. Our findings have important implications for supporting sex
equality and diversity in a traditionally male dominated profession.36
