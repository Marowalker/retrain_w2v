of oral corticosteroids, and adverse events (sepsis, venous thromboembolism,
fractures) associated with their use.

Design Retrospective cohort study and self controlled case series.

Setting Nationwide dataset of private insurance claims.

Participants Adults aged 18 to 64 years who were continuously enrolled
from 2012 to 2014.

Main outcome measures Rates of short term use of oral corticosteroids
defined as less than 30 days duration. Incidence rates of adverse events in
corticosteroid users and non-users. Incidence rate ratios for adverse events within
30 day and 31-90 day risk periods after drug initiation.

Results Of 1 548 945 adults, 327 452 (21.1%) received at least one
outpatient prescription for short term use of oral corticosteroids over the three
year period. Use was more frequent among older patients, women, and white adults,
with significant regional variation (all P<0.001). The most common indications for
use were upper respiratory tract infections, spinal conditions, and allergies.
Prescriptions were provided by a diverse range of specialties. Within 30 days of drug
initiation, there was an increase in rates of sepsis (incidence rate ratio 5.30, 95%
confidence interval 3.80 to 7.41), venous thromboembolism (3.33, 2.78 to 3.99), and
fracture (1.87, 1.69 to 2.07), which diminished over the subsequent 31-90 days. The
increased risk persisted at prednisone equivalent doses of less than 20 mg/day
(incidence rate ratio 4.02 for sepsis, 3.61 for venous thromboembolism, and 1.83 for
fracture; all P<0.001).

Conclusion One in five American adults in a commercially insured plan
were given prescriptions for short term use of oral corticosteroids during a three
year period, with an associated increased risk of adverse events.
==== Body
Introduction
Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that have been used to treat a
variety of diseases for over seven decades, dating back to their introduction for
rheumatoid arthritis in 1949.1
2

5 A strong driver of corticosteroid use is the
potent symptomatic relief they give many patients. Yet long term use of corticosteroids
is generally avoided, given the risks of serious acute complications such as infection,
venous thromboembolism, avascular necrosis, and fracture, as well as chronic diseases
such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and other features of iatrogenic
Cushing’s syndrome.6

18 Indeed, corticosteroids are one of the most
common reasons for admission to hospital for drug related adverse events,19 and optimizing their long term use has been a
major focus for clinical guidelines across diverse specialties for many years.20

In contrast with long term use, however, the risk of complications from short term use
is much less understood, and evidence is generally insufficient to guide clinicians. In
the outpatient setting, brief courses of oral corticosteroids are often used to treat
conditions with clearly defined inflammatory pathophysiology for which there is clinical
consensus for efficacy, such as asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.27
28
29
30
31 Yet anecdotally corticosteroids are also
used often in the short term to treat many other prevalent conditions where evidence is
lacking, such as non-specific musculoskeletal pain and rashes. Despite such pervasive
indications for use of oral corticosteroids, little is known about the prescribing
patterns of short term use of these drugs in the general adult population, or their
potential harm.

In this study we characterized short term use of oral corticosteroids in a contemporary
outpatient population, and the risk of acute adverse events. We describe those who use
oral corticosteroids in the short term in an outpatient setting and then report
(absolute) incidence rates of adverse events in users and non-users. We chose three
acute events listed as adverse events on the Food and Drug Administration mandated drug
label for oral corticosteroids (sepsis, venous thromboembolism, fracture). Given the
inherent challenges related to confounding, we employed a self controlled case series
(SCCS) design. This design has been used to examine drug and vaccine safety.32
33 Using this method, each individual serves as
his or her own control allowing for comparisons of adverse event rates during periods
after exposure to corticosteroids versus rates during periods when not exposed.

Methods
Study design and population
The Clinformatics DataMart database (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN) contains
comprehensive, deidentified records of enrollees covered through a large nationwide
healthcare insurer and its pharmacy services for outpatient drugs. All enrollees are
included in a denominator file, regardless of whether they received services (eg,
clinic visits, drug prescriptions, hospital admissions).

We identified all adults aged 18 to 64 years who were continuously enrolled between 1
January 2012 and 31 December 2014 (n=2 234 931). Those who were 65 years or older at
any point during the study were excluded, owing to their eligibility for the federal
Medicare program.

Patients were also required to have at least one year of continuous enrollment before
the study period (1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011) to capture past use of
corticosteroids and baseline comorbid conditions. To focus on new users, we excluded
those who received any oral corticosteroids during 2011 (n=293 456). In addition, we
excluded from the study cohort enrollees exclusively receiving non-oral forms of
corticosteroids (eg, inhaler, intravenous route, or intra-articular injections only)
or prescriptions for oral budesonide (n=102 243), and those with solid organ or bone
marrow transplants, or malignancy (n=224 658) (see web appendix table 1). We also
excluded patients who were prescribed oral corticosteroids for 30 days or more
cumulatively over the study period (n=28 540). Finally, we excluded those with a
history of adverse events in 2011 (n=37 089) (fig 1).
Non-users in the study cohort were defined as those without any corticosteroid
prescriptions who remained in the cohort after the exclusions. No additional patients
were excluded from the study.

Procedures
For each enrollee, we obtained demographic information on age, sex, race or
ethnicity, highest level of education, and region of the country based on a
residential zip code. Race and ethnicity were identified using information obtained
by OptumInsight from public records (eg, driver’s license data), the surname and
first names of the beneficiary, and the census block of residence (E-Tech, Ethnic
Technologies, South Hackensack, NJ). Studies comparing a similar approach with
information collected from self report showed a positive predictive value of
71%.34 Missing demographic variables were
uncommon (<1%) and are listed as “unknown” for the descriptive analyses only.
Comorbid conditions were ascertained from outpatient and inpatient claims available
for each enrollee during the study period using ICD-9-CM (international
classification of diseases, ninth revision) diagnosis codes that were subsequently
grouped into Elixhauser categories.35

Our primary exposure of interest was an outpatient prescription for an oral
formulation of corticosteroids for less than 30 days, as obtained from detailed
information in each pharmacy claim. Oral corticosteroid was defined by the dosage
form, as categorized by the National Drug Data File from First Data Bank. The
duration of corticosteroid use was based on the “days supply” variable provided
within the pharmacy claim, which was defined as the “estimated day count the
medication supply should last.” Importantly, this information captures actual
prescriptions filled (not just prescriptions written). To calculate standardized
doses for each patient, all corticosteroid formulations were converted into a daily
dose based on prednisone equivalent doses (see web appendix table 2).36
37
38 We also identified multiple outpatient
prescriptions for patients and tabulated the number of repeated doses.

Among all patients in the study cohort, we identified the specialty type of the
prescribing physician and clinical conditions for which corticosteroids were
administered by linking a patient’s first prescription with the principal ICD-9-CM
diagnosis code in the outpatient claim closest to the date of the prescription. If
the closest claim was beyond three days from the prescription, we labeled this
information for that patient as unknown. Overall, we were able to link 215 639 of
327 452 (65.9%) prescribing physicians and 278 425 of 327 452 (85.0%) patients who
received a prescription to an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code. Diagnosis codes were grouped
using clinical classification software obtained from the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality.35
39

We assessed three acute adverse events associated with short term corticosteroid use:
sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fractures. These events were identified using
ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes that reflected acute presentations, with chronic or personal
history codes not included (see web appendix table 3). We specifically selected these
events as they represent a broad range of corticosteroid related acute complications.
Each also has been listed on the FDA mandated drug label as possible adverse
reactions, can be reliably identified in claims data, and has supporting evidence of
pathogenesis early after drug initiation was available.17
40
41
42
43
44
45
46 For sepsis, the outcome was admission to
hospital for reason of sepsis (inpatient claims with a primary diagnosis of sepsis).
For venous thromboembolism and fractures, we used both outpatient and inpatient
claims to identify events.

Statistical analyses
Description of corticosteroid users
We tabulated short term use of oral corticosteroids by age group (in 2014), sex,
race, education, region, and number of Elixhauser comorbidities (grouped as 0, 1
to 2, and ≥3). Student t tests and χ2 tests were used
to assess differences by group. Regional variation in corticosteroid use was
graphed by census division. We ranked the most common reasons for visits
associated with the prescription, as well as specialty types of the prescribing
providers.

Incidence rates of adverse events
For the entire cohort we calculated incidence rates of adverse events per 1000
person years at risk for corticosteroid users and non-users. Rates were also
stratified by age, sex, and race. In addition, we calculated the cumulative risk
of adverse events during the five to 90 day period after a clinic visit for
corticosteroid users and non-users.

Self controlled case series
To control for patient specific characteristics while investigating the risk of
adverse events, we used a self controlled case series (SCCS) design.32
33
47 This method uses a within person
approach to compare the rates of events after corticosteroid use (5-30 days and
31-90 days after the prescription was filled) with the rates before use (see web
appendix figure 1). To be conservative, we modified the SCCS design so that
adverse events within a four day window of when the prescription was filled were
excluded to remove those who might have potentially received the oral
corticosteroid concomitantly with the adverse event.

To preclude capturing multiple follow-up visits after the initial diagnosis of an
adverse event, we only recorded the first event. Those who experienced an adverse
event in the prestudy period of 2011 were excluded to avoid detecting legacy
effects from past episodes. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to
hospital within a 14 day period before the corticosteroid prescription date so
that potential effects related to a recent hospital admission would be removed.
Adjustment was made for time varying covariates related to concomitant drug use.
In these analyses, the most commonly used classes of drugs (42 classes) were coded
for each period and included in the full model; only those drug classes associated
with each outcome (sepsis, venous theomboembolism, fracture) were retained in the
final models.

Fixed (conditional) Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate
ratios, offset by the natural logarithm of the days at risk to correct for
differences in the lengths of observation. Effect modification by demographic
factors (age, sex, race) were assessed by an interaction term.

Sensitivity analyses
We performed an analysis to deal with concerns that we were simply detecting more
adverse events as a result of exposure to medical care rather than exposure to
corticosteroids. For this analysis, we compared 30 day rates of hospital
admissions for sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fractures after a clinic visit
in patients with matched diagnoses who did not receive corticosteroids and those
who did receive corticosteroids after adjusting for age, sex, and race. Secondly,
we used the cohort from the SCCS design and recalculated the incidence rate ratios
after stratification by respiratory conditions or musculoskeletal conditions.
These analyses assessed whether adverse events were being driven potentially by
misdiagnosis (eg, sepsis may be more common because pneumonia is misdiagnosed as
asthma, or fracture may be more common because vertebral fracture is misdiagnosed
as back strain). Thirdly, in another sensitivity analysis we excluded patients who
were using concomitant non-oral forms of corticosteroids. Lastly, we extended the
four day period around the date of the prescription being filled to a seven day
period.

Analyses were conducted with SAS software, v9.4 (SAS Institute), and Stata/MP14.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX). Two tailed P values are reported for all
analyses, with α=0.05. The institutional review board of the University of
Michigan determined the study to be exempt from further review and waived the
requirement for informed consent.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures,
nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation
of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of
results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study
participants or the relevant patient community.

Results
Description of corticosteroid users
Among 1 548 945 adults in the study cohort, 327 452 (21.1%) received at least one
outpatient prescription for short term oral corticosteroids during the three year
study period. The mean age for users was 45.5 (SD 11.6) years compared with 44.1 (SD
12.2) years for non-users (P<0.001). Among the 327 452 corticosteroid users, the
median number of days of use was 6 (interquartile range 6-12 days) with 47.4%
(n=155 171 of 327 452) receiving treatment for seven or more days. Overall, the
median prednisone equivalent daily dose was 20 mg/day (interquartile range 17.5-36.8
mg/day) with 23.4% (n=76 701 of 327 452) receiving ≥40 mg/day. The most common
prescription written for oral corticosteroids was a six day methylprednisolone
“dosepak,” which accounted for 46.9% (n=216 437 of 461 208) of prescriptions during
the study period. Among corticosteroid users, 70.5% (n=230 980 of 327 452) received
one course of treatment, 20.7% (n=67 732 of 327 452) received two courses, and 8.8%
(n=28 740 of 327 452) received three or more courses. For those patients with two or
more prescriptions, the average prescription count was 2.4 (SD 0.7).

Compared with non-users, short term oral corticosteroid users were more often older,
women, white, and had a greater number of comorbid conditions (table 1, all P<0.001). People residing in the Pacific
region had the lowest use of short term oral corticosteroids (12.4%, n=15 762 of
127 112), whereas people in the east south central region (29.4%, n=14 892 of 50 669)
and west south central region (27.6%, n=66 353 of 240 678) had the highest usage (see
web appendix figure 2).

The most common indications for short term oral corticosteroid use were upper
respiratory tract infections, spinal conditions, and intervertebral disc disorders,
allergies, bronchitis, and (non-bronchitic) lower respiratory tract disorders (see
web appendix table 4). These five conditions were associated with about half of all
prescriptions. The two most common specialty types of physicians prescribing short
term oral corticosteroids were family medicine and general internal medicine,
accounting for most prescriptions (see web appendix table 4). These drugs were also
frequently prescribed by specialists in emergency medicine, otolaryngology, and
orthopedics.

Incidence rates of adverse events
Incidence rates of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture were statistically
significantly higher in short term users of oral corticosteroid than in non-users
(table 2). The differences were evident across
age, sex, and race stratums. Fractures were the most common complication in users (21
events for every 1000 users annually), followed by venous thromboembolism (5 events
for every 1000 users annually) and hospital admissions for sepsis (2 events for every
1000 users annually).

*Per 1000 person years at risk.

The absolute risk of an adverse event during the five to 90 day period after a clinic
visit was calculated. For those patients with a visit, the risk of hospital admission
for sepsis was 0.05% (n=170 of 327 452) in steroid users compared with 0.02% (n=293
of 1 221 493) in non-users during this period. The risk of venous thromboembolism was
0.14% (n=472 of 327 452) in users compared with 0.09% (n=1054 of 1 221 493) in
non-users, and the risk of fracture was 0.51% (n=1657 of 327 452) in users compared
with 0.39% (n=4735 of 1 221 493) in non-users in the 90 days after a clinic
visit.

Self controlled case series
Table 3 displays the results of the SCCS. Overall,
risks for sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture increased within the first 30
days after initiation of corticosteroids. For example, the risk of hospital admission
for sepsis increased fivefold (above baseline risk) after oral corticosteroids were
used. This relation was consistent across doses. The long term risk for adverse
events (31-90 days) diminished as the time from initial exposure increased.

†Sepsis was adjusted for antibiotics, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists,

To examine risks for particular types of patients, we explored effect modification by
age, sex, and race. No significant effect modification was found after adjustment for
time varying covariates, except for race; white patients had a higher short term risk
of fractures than non-white patients (incidence rate ratio 2.02, 95% confidence
interval 1.81 to 2.26 for white patients; 1.42, 1.14 to 1.77 for non-white patients;

Sensitivity analyses
Web appendix table 5 displays the results of our analysis of 30 day rates of hospital
admission for sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fractures after a clinic visit in
patients with matched diagnoses who did not receive corticosteroids and those who did
receive corticosteroids after adjusting for age, sex, and race. It shows consistently
higher incidence rates of adverse events in the patients who received
corticosteroids. In the SCCS stratified by respiratory conditions or musculoskeletal
conditions, the incidence rate ratios were recalculated (table 4). The 30 day risk of venous thromboembolism,
fracture, and hospital admission for sepsis was statistically significantly increased
for patients presenting with both respiratory conditions and musculoskeletal
conditions. When we excluded patients using concomitant non-oral forms of
corticosteroids from the analyses, the results were similar (see web appendix table
6). In the 5-30 day window the incidence rate ratio for sepsis was 4.84, for venous
thromboembolism was 3.29, and for fracture was 1.92 (all P<0.001). Extending the
four day period around the date of prescription to a seven day period also did not
appreciably change the results (see web appendix table 7). The incidence rate ratio
for sepsis was 4.33 (95% confidence interval 3.04 to 6.17), for venous
thromboembolism was 2.94 (2.42 to 3.56), and for fracture was 1.65 (1.49 to
1.84).

Discussion
In this large, population based study of privately insured non-elderly (<64 years)
adults in the US, one in five received a new outpatient prescription for short term use
of oral corticosteroids over a three year period. These drugs were used for a wide range
of conditions, such as upper respiratory tract infections, spinal conditions, and
allergies and were commonly prescribed by both generalist and specialist physicians.
Importantly, these prescriptions were associated with statistically significantly higher
rates of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture despite being used for a
relatively brief duration.

Comparison with other studies
Estimates of corticosteroid use from cross sectional studies range from 0.5% to 1.2%
over various study periods.7
9
10 An analysis of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey described self reported use of drugs taken within the
previous 30 days.7 Its findings indicated a
mean duration of corticosteroid use exceeding four years among users—thus capturing a
larger proportion of chronic treatment but potentially underreporting short term use.
Furthermore, although the analyses were weighted, the actual sample of corticosteroid
users included only 356 people. In our longitudinal analysis of 1.5 million insured
Americans, the incidence was approximately 7% for short term oral corticosteroid use
on a yearly basis.

Though the long term complications of chronic corticosteroid use are well known,
there is a paucity of clinical data on the potential short term adverse effects of
corticosteroid use, despite the existence of pathophysiological evidence suggesting
possible early changes after drug initiation. For example, the impact of
corticosteroids on the immune system has been widely studied, and in randomized
controlled trials of prednisone (versus placebo) in healthy adults there were effects
on peripheral cell lines (eg, peripheral white blood cells) within the first day
after drug ingestion that were noticeable with 10 mg, 25 mg, and 60 mg doses.48
49 Rapid alteration in markers of bone
metabolism has also been documented with the initiation of corticosteroid use; mean
serum concentrations of osteocalcin and both serum propeptide of type I N-terminal
and C-terminal procollagen were statistically significantly decreased in the early
weeks after starting prednisone.43 The
mechanisms underlying the increase in venous thromboembolism are not fully known.
However, infection is a common trigger of thrombosis,50 suggesting that both venous thromboembolism and sepsis may
be potentially mediated through changes in the immune system. Further work is needed
to clarify whether and how our observations in this large population may be linked to
potential causal pathways.

Strengths and limitations of this study
Our findings are particularly of concern given the large number of patients exposed
to short term oral corticosteroids in the general adult population. Clinical
guidelines typically recommend using the lowest dose of steroids for the shortest
period to prevent adverse events.24
25 However, we found that even short
durations of use, regardless of dose, were associated with increased risks of adverse
events and that few patients were using very low doses. Only 6.3% of the
prescriptions were for a prednisone equivalent dose of less than 17.5 mg/day, and
1.0% of prescriptions were for less than 7.5 mg/day; therefore, we were unable to
examine events in patients given very low doses for short periods. A major reason for
the higher than expected doses was the widespread use of “fixed dose”
methylprednisolone dosepaks that are tapered over a short period. These dosepaks
offer ease of use but do not permit the individualization of drug dosing to minimize
exposure.

A substantial challenge to improving use of oral corticosteroids will be the diverse
set of conditions and types of providers who administer these drugs in brief courses.
This raises the need for early general medical education of clinicians about the
potential risks of oral corticosteroids and the evidence basis for their use, given
that use may not be specific to a particular disease or specialty. Suprisingly, the
most common prescribers were not subspecialists, such as rheumatologists, who are
most experienced with treating inflammatory conditions and the long term use of these
drugs. We also found that the most common indications for corticosteroid use included
conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections, spinal conditions, and
allergies, which often have marginal benefit and for which alternate treatments may
be similarly effective and safer. For example, a multimodal pain treatment regimen
can be used to treat spinal pain, and non-sedating antihistamines can be used for
allergies. An examination of potential determinants of corticosteroid use will be
needed to inform future intervention strategies. If corticosteroid use is driven by
patient preferences, education on the potential harms should be expanded. If
prescriptions are primarily driven by provider decisions, decision support tools to
identify alternatives to corticosteroids (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
for acute gout30 or tricyclic
antidepressants for neuropathic pain51) may
be a more effective approach, but additional studies will be required to substantiate
these possible alternatives as some of these drugs are available over the
counter.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our cohort only includes commercially
insured adults and excludes patients aged more than 64 years, which potentially
limits the generalisability of our findings. We focused on younger adults as these
individuals tend to have fewer comorbid conditions, and therefore our findings may be
less likely to be biased by the high prevalence of age related comorbid conditions.
Although our reference population is commercially insured adults, we have no reason
to suspect this characteristic should bias a possible association between
corticosteroid use and adverse events. Secondly, we determined the indication for
corticosteroid use and the specific provider prescribing the drug by linking
outpatient claims recorded most closely to the prescription date; thus we might have
misclassified some treatment indications and specialties. Thirdly, we were unable to
adequately assess the risks of adverse events at very low doses of corticosteroids,
given the infrequency of use at these doses.

Fourthly, we did not evaluate all of the possible adverse events linked to oral
corticosteroids but focused on three acute adverse reactions. This makes our findings
even more striking as they are likely a conservative estimate of the associated risks
of adverse events. For example, we only focused on hospital admissions for sepsis,
ignoring less serious but likely important infections, and we did not assess some
adverse events such as behavioral or psychiatric conditions. In addition, a dose-
response trend was not seen and may reflect our selection criteria of using
prescriptions of less than 30 days. Fifthly, although we used a within person
approach to control for genetic predisposition, health related behaviors, and
comorbid conditions and adjusted for time varying use of different drugs, other time
varying factors could be differentially distributed between the risk and baseline
periods. However, the incidence rate ratios were strong (many >3.0) so that any
residual confounding would have to be appreciable to fully explain our findings.
Assumptions of the SCCS design were mitigated by using only the first event for each
of the three outcomes, and therefore independence of recurrent events and the
potential influence of past events on subsequent drug use (if this occurred) yielded
incidence rate ratios that might be somewhat conservative. Survival bias was not an
issue since by design all patients were alive during the periods when the outcomes
were measured (ie, the comparator period was before the first use of
corticosteroids).

Conclusion
Oral corticosteroids are frequently prescribed for short term use in the US for a
variety of common conditions and by numerous provider specialties. Over a three year
period, approximately one in five American adults in a commercially insured plan used
oral corticosteroids for less than 30 days. The short term use of these drugs was
associated with increased rates of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture; even
at relatively low doses. Additional studies are needed to identify optimal use of
corticosteroids and to explore whether treatment alternatives may improve patient
safety.

What is already known on this topic
Complications with chronic use of corticosteroids include a wide spectrum
of effects on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, digestive, endocrine,
ophthalmic, skin, and nervous systems

However, the potential risks associated with the use of short term oral
corticosteroids and their overall use in a general population has not
been fully characterized

What this study adds
This study of 1.5 million privately insured adults (18-64 years) in the
US found that one in five patients in an outpatient setting used short
term oral corticosteroid over a three year period (2012-14)

Within 30 days of corticosteroid initiation, the incidence of acute
adverse events that result in major morbidity and mortality (sepsis,
venous thromboembolism, fracture) increased by twofold, to fivefold above
background rates

Greater attention to initiating prescriptions of these drugs and
monitoring for adverse events may potentially improve patient safety
