==== Body
In this article by von Ehrenstein and colleagues (BMJ 2019;364, doi:10.1136/bmj.l962, published 20 March and in the 23 March print issue), an oversight by coauthor Beate Ritz led to the omission of a potentially perceived conflict of interest on the declaration form (relating to other relationships or activities). The competing interest statement has since been updated in the online article and PDF.
