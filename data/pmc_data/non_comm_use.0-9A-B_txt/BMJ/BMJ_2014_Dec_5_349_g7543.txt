Owing to an editing error, figure 5 in this Research paper (BMJ 2014;349:g6679, doi:10.1136/bmj.g6679) re-displayed the graph in figure 2 when it was first published. This was corrected on 27 November 2014. Furthermore, in figure 4 the numbering on the y axis scale is incorrect. The published version goes from 0-100, when it should go from 90-100, and the graphic has not been condensed to reflect the different range of the values. Below is a correct version of figure 4.
