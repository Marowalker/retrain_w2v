obstetric and neonatal outcomes.

Design Prospective randomised controlled trial.

Setting Birth centre in London teaching hospital.

Participants 2426 nulliparous, non-diabetic women at term, with a
singleton cephalic presenting fetus and in labour with a cervical dilatation of
less than 6 cm.

Intervention Consumption of a light diet or water during labour.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure was spontaneous
vaginal delivery rate. Other outcomes measured included duration of labour, need
for augmentation of labour, instrumental and caesarean delivery rates, incidence
of vomiting, and neonatal outcome.

Results The spontaneous vaginal delivery rate was the same in both
groups (44%; relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.08). No
clinically important differences were found in the duration of labour (geometric
mean: eating, 597 min v water, 612 min; ratio of geometric
means 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.03), the caesarean delivery rate
(30% v 30%; relative risk 0.99, 0.87 to 1.12), or the incidence
of vomiting (35% v 34%; relative risk 1.05, 0.9 to 1.2).
Neonatal outcomes were also similar.

Conclusions Consumption of a light diet during labour did not
influence obstetric or neonatal outcomes in participants, nor did it increase
the incidence of vomiting. Women who are allowed to eat in labour have similar
lengths of labour and operative delivery rates to those allowed water only.

Introduction
The obstetric guideline of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists, published in
2007, states that “the oral intake of solids during labour increases maternal
complications,” and that “solid foods should be avoided in labouring patients.”1 It also recommends that “the oral intake of
modest amounts of clear liquids (e.g. water, clear tea, black coffee, and sports
drink) may be allowed for uncomplicated labouring patients.” The policy of fasting
during labour was adopted after Mendelson published his now classic description of
acid pulmonary aspiration in 1946.2
Pulmonary aspiration in obstetrics has declined dramatically in recent years,
probably as a result of the increased use of regional anaesthesia for operative
deliveries, the perioperative use of H2 antagonists and proton pump
inhibitors, and widespread improvements in the training of obstetric
anaesthetists.3

8 Consequently, in some countries, the
policy of routine fasting for all parturients has been challenged.9
10
11
12 Relaxation of the rule has been more
prevalent in Europe than in the United States. In the Netherlands 79% of clinicians
allow food intake in labour,11 and among
351 birth units in the United Kingdom 32% allowed food and drink.9 Although it has not been formally evaluated,
many clinicians have observed that women request food in labour. In contrast, in the
United States oral intake during labour is limited primarily to clear liquids.

To date five randomised controlled trials, in fewer than 1000 women, have evaluated
the influence of calorific intake on outcome of labour.13
14
15
16
17 Four studies reported no significant
differences in either the mode of delivery or neonatal outcome13
14
15
17; however, one study reported longer
labours in women who consumed food,13 and
another showed an almost threefold increase in the rate of caesarean delivery.16 These, however, had limited power to
detect clinically important differences or show the clinical equivalence of
treatments.

The current rationale for women fasting during labour is to protect them from
pulmonary aspiration should general anaesthesia be needed for an emergency operative
delivery. However, prolonged fasting in labour has never been proved to influence
the incidence of pulmonary aspiration, and some clinicians and midwives consider
that preventing food intake can be detrimental to the mother, her baby, and the
progress of labour.18
19

22 Whether food intake in labour will
influence the ability to deliver normally, the length of labour, or other obstetric
and neonatal end points is not known.

We did a randomised trial to determine the influence of consumption of food during
labour on the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery. Other outcomes measured included
duration of labour, incidence of vomiting, and neonatal outcome.

Methods
We did the trial at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London between June 2001 and
April 2006. 

Selection of patients
Women were informed of the study during the second or third trimesters of
pregnancy. This was to ensure previous knowledge and understanding of the aims
of the study before women gave written consent later in the delivery suite. We
invited women to participate if they were over 18 years of age, were
nulliparous, were more than 36 weeks’ gestation, did not have diabetes, had a
singleton cephalic presenting fetus, and were in labour with a cervical
dilatation of less than 6 cm. We included women having induction or augmentation
of labour. We did not recruit multiparous women, given their potentially quicker
labours and low operative delivery rates—that is, less exposure to the
intervention and low prevalence of the primary outcome measure.

We excluded women who had a known obstetric or medical complication that could
have increased the likelihood of an operative delivery, were in severe pain,
intended to use parenteral opioids for analgesia during labour, or were unable
to understand English (and no interpreter was available).

Study design
After women gave informed, written consent, the attending midwife randomised them
either into the “eating” or the “water only” group. Entry of a woman’s initials,
hospital number, and date of birth on to a dedicated computer on the labour ward
automatically generated the allocation group together with a study number, which
was then recorded on the outcome sheet. These data could, if necessary, be
verified against the computer randomisation at a later time.

Dietary advice
After randomisation, women in the eating group were advised to consume a low fat,
low residue diet at will during their labour. The emphasis was on small regular
amounts of food rather than eating set regular meals. Suggested foods included
bread, biscuits, vegetables, fruits, low fat yoghurt, soup, isotonic drinks, and
fruit juice. All women had free access to water. Women in the water only group
were advised to have ice chips and water only. Women were told that eating was
not recommended in labour (as was the policy in the hospital at the time), but
they were actively encouraged to do so if randomised to the feeding arm. Women
were made aware that this is increasingly practised in many units. Women in the
water only group were encouraged not to eat if they requested to do so. Light
food was made available on the labour ward, or women could bring in their own
food.

Data collection
The attending midwife was responsible for entering outcome data on to a data
sheet. Age, ethnicity, food intake for six hours before labour and during
labour, the incidence of vomiting (once and more than once), and the indication
for intravenous fluids were recorded. Obstetric outcomes included the mode of
delivery (primary outcome), the duration of labour, and use of intravenous
oxytocin for the augmentation of labour. We categorised food intake in the six
hours before labour as no intake, snacks, a light meal, or a large meal. We
categorised food intake during labour as no intake, water only, or calorific
drinks/solids. The exact food consumed was at each woman’s discretion. The trial
coordinator was responsible for training midwives on the study protocol and
adherence to the protocol and for the daily collection of data sheets. All data
were then entered on to a Microsoft Excel 2000 spreadsheet.

Obstetric management
The attending obstetricians and midwives made all the relevant decisions about
the woman’s obstetric management but obviously could not be blinded to trial
allocation. The people deciding on obstetric interventions were generally
unaware of the trial intervention allocation and had no vested interest in the
study. Vaginal dilatation was assessed at four hourly intervals. Continuous
external fetal heart rate monitoring and tocodynamometry were used as indicated.
Oxytocin infusion, when indicated, was administered according to the hospital
protocol. No routine antacid was administered. The decision to proceed to an
operative delivery was made by the duty obstetrician. The attending midwife
recorded the Apgar scores at delivery.

Analgesia during labour
The women had access to a birthing pool for both labour and delivery. They could
also choose 50:50 nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox) or epidural analgesia. A
low dose local anaesthetic and opioid solution (bupivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl 2
μg/ml) was used for epidural analgesia. Analgesia was initially achieved with
10-15 ml of this solution and maintained with the same solution through a
patient controlled epidural analgesia system. This system was maintained by
using a bolus dose of 9.9 ml with a lockout time of 20 minutes. The maximum dose
of the local anaesthetic and opioid solution was 30 ml/hour.

Outcome measures
The primary outcome was the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery, and the
secondary outcome was the duration of labour. We defined duration of labour as
the time from the onset of the active phase of first stage until the end of the
second stage of labour, when the baby was delivered. For women who presented on
the labour ward after the establishment of active labour, the duration was
recorded as the time from admission until the end of the second stage of labour.
We considered the duration of labour to be zero in those women who had a
caesarean delivery before the establishment of the active phase of labour. The
instrumental delivery rate, the caesarean delivery rate, and the need for
augmentation of labour were also recorded.

Neonatal outcome—One minute and five minute Apgar scores were
recorded, as was the fetal weight. The need for admission to the neonatal
intensive care unit or special care baby unit was also assessed.

Statistical analysis
We determined that 1126 women would give 90% power to detect a clinically
important difference in the spontaneous vaginal delivery rate of 6.7% (60%
v 66.7%; risk ratio 1.11). The clinicians involved in the
trial, after discussion of the relevant issues, agreed that evidence of a
difference of 6.7% would be clinically important, having the potential to affect
clinical practice. Assuming that duration of labour is normally distributed and
using a mean duration from a similar but unpublished study of 297 women,13 we calculated that 1212 participants
would be needed for a 10% change in the duration of labour. In setting the
clinically important differences, we made allowance for a possible substantial
non-compliance rate. We did the analysis according to the intention to treat
principle, making comparisons between groups as randomised. Results are
presented as estimates with 95% confidence intervals, to facilitate
determination of clinical equivalence.23 We analysed data by using Excel 2000, Student’s
t test, and Stata version 9. As we found that duration of
labour had a strongly skewed distribution, we used log transformations, and
results are reported as geometric means and as ratios of geometric means.

Results
We randomised 2443 nulliparous women to this trial, of whom 17 were excluded from the
final analysis. The figure shows the reasons for
exclusion. Of the 2426 participants included in the analysis, 1219 were in the
eating group and 1207 were in the water only group. In view of the round the clock
recruitment, we were unable to ensure accurate data on the number of women
approached and their reasons for declining. Women were not approached when midwives
were untrained in the study protocol. Women generally refused if they definitely
wanted to eat. During the study period 12 918 nulliparous women laboured with
singleton babies with cephalic presentation, although not all these women were
eligible if in advanced labour (>5 cm dilatation). The two randomised groups were
comparable with respect to age, ethnic group, pre-labour food intake, need for
intravenous fluids, and use of prostaglandin and oxytocin. The birth weights of the
neonates were similar in both groups (table 1).
One serious adverse event (maternal death) occurred in the water only group, and
this was due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage. No cases of pulmonary aspiration of
gastric contents occurred.

One hundred and thirty seven women (5.6% of participants) consumed nothing during
labour. Of the women allocated to water only, 20% failed to adhere to the protocol
and consumed food. Of those allocated to the eating group, 29% chose not to eat.
Food consumed by the women included fruit juice, soup, cereal, biscuits, fruits,
chocolate, toast, vegetable stew, Danish pastry, sandwiches, burgers, chicken, and
rice.

Primary outcome
By intention to treat, we found no significant difference in the rate of normal
vaginal delivery between the two groups. The rates were 533/1219 (44%) in the
eating group and 534/1207 (44%) in the water only group (risk ratio 0.99, 95%
confidence interval 0.90 to 1.09) (table 2).

Secondary and neonatal outcomes
We found no significant difference in the duration of labour between the two
groups (table 2). The geometric mean duration
of labour was 597 minutes for the eating group and 612 minutes for the water
group (ratio of geometric means 0.975, 95% confidence interval 0.927 to
1.025).

We found no significant difference between the groups with respect to the rate of
instrumental vaginal delivery or caesarean delivery, the incidence of maternal
vomiting, or the use of epidural analgesia or of oxytocin for augmentation of
labour (table 2). Although ketonuria was a
pre-defined end point in this study, a large proportion of women did not have
urinalysis in late labour, and we therefore had to abandon this as a meaningful
end point.

When we compared women who actually fed with those who did not the results were
similar (normal vaginal delivery 44% v 44%; risk ratio 0.99,
0.91 to 0.108). No cases of aspiration occurred during the study period.

We found no differences between the two groups with respect to Apgar scores or
admission to neonatal intensive care or special care units (table 3). The confidence intervals were sufficiently
tight to exclude clinically important differences.

Discussion
This study, the largest prospective randomised study to have evaluated the influence
of food consumption during labour, suggests that this practice does not influence
obstetric or neonatal outcomes. Feeding does not shorten labour, nor does it
increase the chance of a normal delivery; withholding food is therefore not
detrimental to these end points. We are confident that no clinically important
difference existed between the two treatment arms in either the mode of delivery or
duration of labour, as shown by the confidence intervals.

Considering previous data,24 one study of
297 women found a significantly longer duration of labour in women who consumed food
during labour,13 whereas Scheepers et al
showed a significantly increased caesarean delivery rate (risk ratio 2.9, 1.29 to
6.54).16 In the light of this, much
larger study, both of these may be incorrect. A later study by Scheepers et al
investigated the impact of intake of carbohydrate solution just before the start of
the second stage of labour on maternal and fetal metabolism and clinical outcome and
found no differences in the rates of instrumental and caesarean delivery between the
groups.25 The other three trials that
have evaluated calorific intake during labour showed no significant effect on labour
or neonatal outcome but were not sufficiently powered to evaluate these
outcomes.14
15
17 Scrutton et al showed that eating in
labour prevented the development of ketosis but significantly increased residual
gastric volume,14 whereas Kubli et al
showed that isotonic drinks reduced maternal ketosis during labour without
increasing gastric volume.15 In accordance
with our findings, Tranmer et al reported no difference in the incidence of
dystocia, the need for augmentation of labour, the duration of labour, or the method
of delivery between the intervention (unrestricted oral carbohydrate intake) and
control (ice chips and water) groups.17

Parenteral opioid analgesia was an exclusion factor in our study, as opioids cause a
significant delay in gastric emptying during labour and may increase the risk of
vomiting.26 The use of low dose local
anaesthetic and opioid solutions for epidural analgesia was not an exclusion
criterion. Low dose local anaesthetic and opioid solutions containing fentanyl do
not significantly prolong gastric emptying,27
28 unless the amount of fentanyl
administered exceeds 100 μg.

The main concern of anaesthetists with regard to eating during labour is the
potential risk of pulmonary aspiration, should general anaesthesia be needed. The
triennial reports of the UK Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health
indicate that the incidence of pulmonary aspiration of gastric content has declined
considerably in the past 20 years, despite an increasingly liberal attitude to
eating during labour.3
4
5
6
7
8 In the most recent report (2003-5), six
direct anaesthesia related maternal deaths occurred among 2 113 831 deliveries, none
of which was associated with pulmonary aspiration. This is consistent with the
finding of the review of 133 aspirations during anaesthesia from the Australian
Anaesthesia Incident Monitoring Study.29

Equally, denial of food can be seen as authoritarian and intimidating, which may for
some women increase feelings of fear and apprehension during labour.30 Eating and drinking may allow mothers to
feel normal and healthy.31 Women tend to
follow their normal dietary pattern in early labour but reduce their food intake as
labour becomes more painful.17
32 In Mendelson’s original paper, mortality
was related only to choking on solid food. In the light of this and the absence of
evidence to the contrary, women who wish to eat should be discouraged from solid
food. However, given the current extremely low incidence of pulmonary aspiration in
the obstetric population, some clinicians may decide, in low risk labouring women,
that the consumption of a light diet could be left to the woman’s discretion.

Conclusions
This randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether the policy of
fasting during labour is justified in modern obstetric practice. We found that
eating during labour did not influence neonatal or obstetric outcomes, including
the rates of spontaneous and operative delivery and the duration of labour. This
trial was unable to show evidence of harm as it was not powered to do so given
the low prevalence of aspiration, and this question of harm is unlikely to be
answered in clinical trials because of the extremely low incidence of acid
pulmonary aspiration. The biggest evidence for safety is probably related to the
lack of aspiration related morbidity in recent years,7 in spite of an increasing trend to feeding in labour
over the past decades.9
10 Aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia is
significantly associated with intubation and ventilation.33 In modern obstetric practice it is the use of regional
anaesthesia, thereby avoiding intubation, rather then fasting regimens that is
likely to have reduced mortality from aspiration. Although the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended, on the basis of
consensus opinion, that women in normal labour may eat/drink in labour, our
trial shows that this will not improve their obstetric and neonatal
outcomes.

What is already known on this topic
The practice of fasting women during labour was intended to
protect them from pulmonary aspiration should general
anaesthesia be needed for an emergency operative delivery

Prolonged fasting in labour has never been proved to influence
the incidence of pulmonary aspiration

Some clinicians and midwives argue that preventing food intake
during labour can be detrimental to the mother, her baby, and
the progress of labour

What this study adds
Eating did not influence obstetric (mode of delivery or duration
of labour) or neonatal outcomes

No evidence of harm was found, but the power was insufficient to
imply safety owing to the current extremely low incidence of
acid pulmonary aspiration in obstetrics

If low risk women are offered a light, easily digestible diet
during labour they should be advised that this will not improve
their obstetric and neonatal outcome

We are indebted to the mothers, midwives, anaesthetists, and obstetricians at
St Thomas’ Hospital for their cooperation and consistent support.
