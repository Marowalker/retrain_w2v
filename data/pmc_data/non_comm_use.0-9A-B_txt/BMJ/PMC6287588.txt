==== Body
Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism,
is a common, potentially fatal yet treatable condition. After short term oral
anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrent VTE after discontinuing
anticoagulants is variable, depending on the presence or absence of provoking
factors at the time of the initial event. Some patient subgroups with major
provoking factors (eg, post-surgical VTE) have a low risk of recurrent VTE (1% at
one year)1 and anticoagulants can be safely
discontinued after short term treatment.2
However, more than 50% of patients with VTE do not have a major provoking
factor.3 In these patients with
unprovoked VTE, the risk of recurrent VTE is substantially higher; up to 10% in the
first year after stopping short term treatment, 5% in the subsequent year,4 and 30% at eight years.5 Recurrent VTE is fatal in 3.6% of cases.6

Oral anticoagulant treatment is effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE
during treatment; oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE by
80-90%.7 Longer term oral anticoagulant
treatment likely only delays recurrent VTE compared with short term treatment.8
9
10 The highest bleeding risks are observed
during initial oral treatment. Patients who do not bleed during this time, termed
“anticoagulant experienced” patients, are at lower risk of major bleeding with
ongoing treatment (1.3% per year).7 Major
bleeding is fatal in 11.3% of affected patients.6

Guidelines recommend long term anticoagulant treatment in patients with unprovoked
VTE with non-high bleeding risks, but this is based on weak evidence (grade 2B)11 owing to closely balanced competing risks
and burdens of recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Hence, the clinical question of who
should continue taking anticoagulants indefinitely and who can safely discontinue
them after short term treatment for unprovoked VTE remains a high research
priority.9
10 To answer this important question, the
long term risks and burdens of recurrent VTE must be balanced against the long term
risks and burdens of oral anticoagulant treatment, especially major bleeding. The
International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis suggests that it is safe to
discontinue anticoagulants if the risk of recurrent VTE is less than 5% at one year
after discontinuing treatment.12 To date,
no clinical decision rules 13
14
15 designed to achieve these standards have
been prospectively validated.

We previously derived a clinical decision rule to identify patients at low risk of
recurrent VTE who could discontinue anticoagulants.15 The clinical decision rule, HERDOO2, identifies women with one or
fewer of the four following criteria as being at low risk of recurrent VTE:
Hyperpigmentation, Edema, or Redness in either leg; D-dimer level ≥250 μg/L during
treatment with anticoagulants; Obesity with body mass index ≥30; and Older age, ≥65
years (fig 1).15 No subgroup of men could be identified as low risk for recurrent VTE.
Before adopting a clinical decision rule in clinical practice it should be
prospectively validated in multiple clinical settings.17 As such, we validated the HERDOO2 clinical decision rule
in a multinational prospective cohort management study.

Methods
Study design
We conducted a prospective multinational cohort management study of patients with
a first unprovoked VTE event who were included after 5-12 months of
anticoagulant treatment. Women were classified as low risk if they had none or
one of the four HERDOO2 criteria (fig 1). Women
who met two or more criteria and all men were classified as high risk. Per
protocol, low risk patients were to discontinue anticoagulants (intervention
arm), whereas anticoagulant management in high risk patients was left to the
discretion of the clinicians and patients (observation arm). Participants were
then followed for one year for recurrent VTE and major bleeding. All patients
provided written informed consent before participation.

Study participants and setting
Consecutive unselected patients at 44 secondary and tertiary care centres in
seven countries (see supplementary appendix) were asked to participate if they
had a first episode of major, symptomatic, objectively proved unprovoked VTE
5-12 months before enrolment (referred to as the index VTE). Index VTE was
defined as unprovoked, in line with other studies,18
19
20 in the absence of the following
major VTE provoking factors: leg fracture or lower extremity plaster cast,
immobilisation for more than three days, major surgery in the three months
before the index VTE event, and no diagnosis of a malignancy in the past five
years (with the exception of localised skin malignancy). Patients with
malignancy arising after diagnosis of index VTE but before enrolment were not
eligible for inclusion. Patients with previous episodes of provoked VTE were
eligible. Index VTE associated with minor or weak risk factors such as travel,
exogenous oestrogen, minor immobilisation, or minor surgery was considered
unprovoked as it is unclear if the risk of recurrence in “weakly provoked” VTE
is low enough to discontinue anticoagulants.12 Objective confirmation of index major VTE comprised either deep
vein thrombosis demonstrated with a non-compressible segment in the popliteal
vein or more proximal leg veins on compression venous ultrasonography and/or
pulmonary embolism demonstrated on a high probability perfusion scan21 or a segmental or more proximal
pulmonary artery filling defect on computed tomography (CT) pulmonary
angiography. Index VTE had to have been managed for 5-12 months with an
appropriate anticoagulant treatment, including initial treatment with either
unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, rivaroxaban, or apixaban,
followed by 5-12 months of oral anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K
antagonists (target international normalised ratio 2-3), dabigatran,
rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.

Patients were excluded if they were unable or unwilling to provide informed
consent; were aged less than 18 years; had already discontinued oral
anticoagulant treatment; required ongoing anticoagulation (eg, mechanical heart
valves, atrial fibrillation, inferior vena cava filter, or had known high risk
thrombophilia before enrolment. High risk thrombophilia included deficiency of
protein S, protein C, or antithrombin, persistently positive antiphospholipid
antibodies, or two or more known other thrombophilic defects (eg, homozygous for
factor V Leiden mutation or prothrombin gene mutation, or compound heterozygous
for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation)); were geographically
inaccessible for follow-up; had planned to use exogenous oestrogen (patch, ring,
oral contraceptive, or hormone replacement therapy) if anticoagulant treatment
was discontinued; or had pregnancy associated index VTE (antepartum or
postpartum (within 12 weeks of delivery)).

Standardised baseline patient assessment
The baseline assessment took place 5-12 months after the index VTE event, while
patients were still receiving oral anticoagulant treatment. We documented
demographic data, causes, and diagnostic or therapeutic management of the index
VTE event. In women, body mass index was calculated and both legs were examined
for hyperpigmentation, oedema, or redness. D-Dimer samples were drawn during
anticoagulant treatment at the baseline assessment (at any time if the patient
was using vitamin K antagonists or at the time of peak anticoagulant effect for
the other oral anticoagulants (dabigatran 4-8 hours, apixaban 2-6 hours,
rivaroxaban 2-6 hours, and edoxaban 2-6 hours)). Within one hour of collection,
plasma samples were double centrifuged at 2500×g for 20 minutes and D-dimer
testing was performed immediately. If testing was not available locally, samples
were immediately frozen at −70oC and transported on dry ice. D-dimer
was measured using VIDAS D-dimer reagent on the VIDAS Instrument (bioMérieux,
Marcy L’Etoile, France).

We then applied the HERDOO2 clinical decision rule. Per protocol, low risk women
were to discontinue oral anticoagulant treatment, whereas continuation of
anticoagulation in men and high risk women was left to the discretion of the
clinicians and patients.

We also obtained baseline results for bilateral leg compression ultrasonography
and either a ventilation-perfusion scan or perfusion only scan or CT pulmonary
angiography. Baseline imaging was conducted to assist in the diagnosis of
subsequent suspected recurrent VTE in patients who discontinued
anticoagulants.

Follow-up and outcome assessment
Patients were contacted by telephone or seen in person at six months (two weeks
either way). High risk patients were also telephoned or seen in person at one
year (two weeks either way), whereas all low risk patients were seen in person
at one year (two weeks either way). A structured interview for suspected VTE or
bleeding was conducted at these visits. We also recorded the use of oral
anticoagulant treatment. In addition to these visits, patients were instructed
to contact study staff if they developed symptoms of recurrent VTE or bleeding
at any time during follow-up. Participants were withdrawn and censored at the
time they withdrew consent and did not permit the collection of further
follow-up data, were lost to follow-up, or died.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was adjudicated symptomatic major VTE (new popliteal vein or
more proximal deep vein thrombosis and/or new pulmonary embolism in at least a
segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery). Secondary outcomes included major
bleeding and mortality.

Two physicians independently adjudicated all available information about patients
who died or were suspected of having an outcome (adjudicators were not from the
same institution as the study participant). Adjudicators were blinded to the
result of the clinical decision rule assessment and to the presence or absence
of anticoagulant treatment. The criteria used for the diagnosis of recurrent
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were as previously published15 but in brief required documentation of
new proximal deep vein thrombosis and/or segmental pulmonary embolism compared
with baseline imaging (or index VTE imaging if baseline imaging was not
available).22 Deaths were
adjudicated and categorised as due to pulmonary embolism (certain, highly
probable, possible, or unlikely), bleeding, or other. Major bleeds were defined
as clinically overt bleeding associated with death or a decrease in haemoglobin
concentration of more than 20 g/L or transfusion of two or more units of whole
blood or red blood cells or bleeding in a critical area or organ (intracranial,
intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular, pericardial, or
intramuscular with compartment syndrome).23

Statistical analysis
We sought a sample size sufficient to ensure that the risk of recurrent major VTE
in low risk patients was at most 3% at one year (ie, upper bound of the
confidence interval of the estimate of recurrent VTE at one year was <3%). To
achieve this standard, at 80% power, with an anticipated rate of recurrent VTE
of 1.8% at one year in low risk patients, we estimated we would require 828 low
risk patients who discontinued anticoagulants (including a 9% inflation for
censored patients). After beginning enrolment in our study, the International
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis suggested that a recurrent VTE risk
threshold of less than 5% at one year with an upper bound of the 95% confidence
interval at 8% would be required to prove that patients with VTE could safely
discontinue anticoagulants.12 In light
of this more liberal threshold, the steering committee approved a revised sample
size of 600 low risk patients who discontinued anticoagulants to more than
adequately power the study to meet these recommended requirements.

In our a priori defined primary analysis, we determined the incidence of
recurrent “major VTE” per patient year of follow-up in classifiable low risk
patients who discontinued anticoagulants, and the exact binomial 95% confidence
interval around this rate. In a priori planned analyses of secondary outcomes,
we explored the rate of major bleeding, death due to pulmonary embolism, and
total mortality. In a priori planned subgroup analyses, we also explored the
risk of recurrent major VTE and major bleeding in classifiable high risk
patients who continued anticoagulants and in high risk patients who discontinued
anticoagulants. Only complete case analysis was conducted (ie, only classifiable
patients were analysed). All analyses were conducted with SAS V 9.3 software
(SAS institute, Cary, NC).

Patient involvement
Patient partners were not involved in the design or conduct of this study that
began in 2008. Patient partners in the CanVECTOR network (www.canvector.ca) will be involved in dissemination/knowledge
translation activities.

Results
Between November 2008 and February 2015, we approached 3155 eligible participants, of
whom 370 declined to participate, leaving 2785 enrolled participants in 44 centres
in seven countries (fig 2). Of these, 2779 were
classifiable with the HERDOO2 clinical decision rule and six were not (D-dimer
result unavailable). Thirty two patients had no follow-up, leaving 2747 analysed
patients with a mean age of 54.4 (SD 16.7 years), 44.3% were female, and 83.7% were
white (table 1). In addition to the 32 patients
with no follow-up, 31 patients had incomplete follow-up (63/2779 (2.3% lost to
follow-up)). Index first unprovoked VTEs were isolated deep vein thrombosis (40.5%),
isolated pulmonary embolism (38.9%), and deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
(20.6%). Of 1213 women, 622 (51.3%) were classified as low risk with the clinical
decision rule and, of these, 591 discontinued anticoagulants and 31 continued
treatment. Of 2125 high risk patients (1534 men and 591 high risk women), 1802
(84.8%) continued anticoagulants and 323 (15.2%) discontinued treatment (fig 2).

Primary endpoint
Seventy participants had recurrent major VTE, with one death from pulmonary
embolism (case fatality rate 1.4%, 95% confidence interval 0.3% to 7.7%). Of the
591 low risk women who discontinued anticoagulants, 17 developed recurrent major
VTE during 564 patient years of follow-up (3.0% recurrent VTE per patient year,
95% confidence interval 1.8% to 4.8%) (table 2). A low risk patient, in retrospect, noted to have persistent unexplained
thrombocytosis from the time of index VTE, was subsequently confirmed to have
JAK-2 positive essential thrombocytosis at the time of VTE recurrence without
anticoagulant treatment.

‡According to definition by International Society on Thrombosis and
Haemostasis.23

One additional low risk woman developed cerebral vein thrombosis during one year
follow-up without anticoagulant treatment (not in a priori defined primary
outcome). In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, including cerebral vein thrombosis
in a modified primary outcome, the risk of recurrent VTE in low risk women would
have been 3.2% (95% confidence interval 2.0% to 5.0%). In a second post hoc
“worst case scenario” sensitivity analysis, assuming all low risk patients who
discontinued anticoagulants who were lost to follow-up (n=16) developed
recurrent VTE and including cerebral vein thrombosis in a modified primary
outcome, the risk of recurrent VTE in low risk women would have been 5.7% (4.1%
to 7.8%).

In 323 high risk patients who discontinued anticoagulants, 25 recurrent VTE
events occurred during 309 patient years of follow-up (8.1% recurrent VTE per
patient year, 95% confidence interval 5.2% to 11.9%). The risk of recurrent
major VTE in high risk women who discontinued anticoagulants (7.4% 3.0% to
15.3%) was comparable with men who discontinued anticoagulants (8.4%, 5.0% to
13.2%). Twenty eight high risk patients who continued anticoagulants had
recurrent VTE during 1758 patient years of follow-up (1.6% recurrent VTE per
patient year, 95% confidence interval 1.1% to 2.3%) (see table 2).

Bleeding events
Twenty two major bleeds occurred during 1788 person years of follow-up in
patients who continued anticoagulants (1.2% major bleeds per patient year, 95%
confidence interval 0.8% to 1.9%) compared with three major bleeds during 874
years of follow-up in patients who discontinued anticoagulants (0.3% major
bleeds per patient year, 0.1% to 1.0%). Two major bleeds resulted in death
(major bleed case fatality rate was 8.0%, 95% confidence interval 2.2% to
25.0%).

Subgroup analyses
Of 429 low risk women of premenopausal age (<50 years) who discontinued
anticoagulants, the risk of recurrent VTE was low regardless of whether their
index VTE was associated with oestrogen (n=291) (1.4% per patient year, 95%
confidence interval 0.4% to 3.7%) or not associated with oestrogen (n=138) (3.1%
per patient year, 0.8% to 7.9%) (table 3). In
contrast, the risk of recurrent VTE was 5.7% per patient year (95% confidence
interval 2.6% to 10.9%) in low risk women of postmenopausal age (≥50 years) who
discontinued anticoagulants (n=162).

*HERDOO2 criteria: hyperpigmentation, oedema, or redness in either leg at
5-12 months at baseline or enrolment visit, VIDAS D-dimer ≥250 μg/L
during anticoagulant treatment, obesity with body mass index ≥30, or
older age, ≥65 years. Low risk=0 or 1 of the criteria present.

In additional subgroup analyses, there were no differences in the rate of
recurrent VTE over one year follow-up in low risk women who discontinued
anticoagulants according to 1) country or region of enrolment, 2) type of index
VTE (isolated deep vein thrombosis, isolated pulmonary embolism, deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), or 3) type of anticoagulant treatment at the
time of baseline visit (table 3).

Discussion
We prospectively validated a clinical decision rule to identify low risk patients who
can safely discontinue anticoagulants after completing 5-12 months of treatment for
a first unprovoked VTE. Women with none or one of the HERDOO2 criteria had a low
risk of recurrent VTE and can safely discontinue anticoagulants after completing
short term treatment. This is an important finding because using our rule over half
of women with unprovoked VTE can safely discontinue anticoagulants and be spared the
burdens, costs, and risks of indefinite anticoagulation.

The question of duration of anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent VTE after
a first unprovoked event is controversial.24 Updated consensus guidelines suggest anticoagulants should be
continued indefinitely in patients with unprovoked VTE with a non-high bleeding
risk.11
25 We have shown that half of women with
unprovoked VTE, regardless of bleeding risk, can safely discontinue anticoagulants.
The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis suggests that it is
appropriate to stop anticoagulants in subgroups with a point estimate of recurrent
VTE at one year below 5% if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is less
than 8%.12 In our study, we have shown that
the one year recurrent VTE point estimate and the upper bound of the 95% confidence
interval in low risk women with one or none of the HERDOO2 criteria are both less
than 5%.

Several individual predictors that seem to stratify the risk of recurrent VTE in
patients with unprovoked index VTE have been identified, including sex, plasma
D-dimer levels measured 1-2 months after discontinuation of oral anticoagulant
treatment,26 and residual venous
obstruction using venous ultrasonography.27
28 None of these individual predictors
appears to adequately identify a subgroup of patients with unprovoked VTE with a
sufficiently low risk of recurrence to safely discontinue anticoagulants. Other
multivariable clinical decision rules have been developed but have not been
prospectively validated, including the Vienna prediction model13 and the DASH score.14

Whether men and high risk women require indefinite anticoagulation remains
controversial and was not the primary focus of our study. However, future research
to identify additional low risk subgroups who may be able to also discontinue
anticoagulants, will be important given that a large proportion of “high risk”
patients will not develop recurrent VTE during non-use of oral anticoagulants. For
example, in our long term follow-up study of the derivation group for our clinical
decision rule, the risk of VTE in men and high risk women during eight years’
follow-up was less than 40% (ie, >60% did not recur in the long term).5

Strengths and limitations of this study
Strengths of this study include the homogenous patient population (we only
included symptomatic major VTE and excluded distal deep vein thrombosis and
subsegmental pulmonary embolism) treated uniformly with short duration
anticoagulant treatment (5-12 months). We applied our clinical decision rule
prospectively in patients in whom the clinical decision is uncertain (patients
with weakly provoked and unprovoked VTE) and at the time point that clinicians
generally use to assist patients in making this decision about long term
treatment. The large sample size of the study permitted precise estimates of
recurrence in low risk patients. Most low risk patients stopped anticoagulants
(95%) as planned, suggesting the rule was acceptable to clinicians and patients.
Our rule, consisting of a limited number of simple elements previously shown to
have high interobserver reliability,29
was applied by a wide variety of clinicians in a wide variety of settings in
multiple countries, and performed well. We had minimal loss to follow-up (2.3%).
All of our outcomes were symptomatic, objectively documented, and independently
adjudicated compared with baseline imaging without knowledge of clinical
decision rule classification or oral anticoagulant treatment. We included
patients whose VTE was treated with vitamin K antagonists and direct oral
anticoagulants, providing reassurance that our rule can be used with all
contemporary treatment management strategies. We are optimistic that low risk
women (none or one of the HERDOO2 criteria) will continue to be low risk in
longer term follow-up as we showed in our derivation study.5 It is likely that low risk women will have a low risk of
recurrent VTE over longer term follow-up because patients with unprovoked VTE
have a lower risk of recurrent VTE in the years that follow the first year
without anticoagulants.5 None the less,
longer term follow-up of low risk women (none or one of the HERDOO2 criteria)
should be the object of future research. Finally, study characteristics,
participant characteristics, and outcomes were comparable between our derivation
study population and validation study population (table 4).

Our work also has limitations. Firstly, in our derivation study we chose to
explore all known potential predictors of recurrent VTE and we used complete
case analysis rather than imputation of missing data in model building. We also
chose to dichotomise our potential predictors at optimal cut points, minimise
the final number of predictors, and use a simple scoring system to make the rule
easy to use and more likely to be adopted in practice. However, by modeling with
a dataset that contained a low event per predictor variable ratio, not imputing
missing data, dichotomising variables at optimal cut points, and not using the
exact or representative predictor variable weightings, we potentially derived a
less powerful model and one that risked being over-fit. However, by validating
our simple model in the current study we have shown that the HERDOO2 rule was
not over-fit. Secondly, patients with known “high risk” thrombophilia were
excluded hence our findings may not apply to these patients. Thirdly, we used a
single D-dimer reagent and instrument (VIDAS D-dimer, bioMérieux, Marcy
L’Etoile, France) at half of the usual cut point for D-Dimer testing that is
used in diagnostic management. It is uncertain if other D-dimer assays can be
used in our clinical decision rule. Fourthly, some subgroups require further
elaboration. In women of premenopausal age (<50 years) with none or one of
the HERDOO2 criteria who discontinued anticoagulants, the risk of recurrent VTE
was low (<5% at one year) regardless of whether or not these women were using
exogenous oestrogen at the time of their index VTE event (table 3). These results are consistent with previous
studies, which suggest that women with oestrogen associated VTE have a
comparable risk of recurrent VTE to age matched women with non-oestrogen
associated VTE, suggesting that oestrogen is not an important independent
predictor of recurrent VTE in otherwise unprovoked VTE.30
31 Furthermore, we have previously
shown that women with oestrogen associated VTE with a low HERDOO2 score had an
eightfold lower risk of recurrent VTE than women with oestrogen associated VTE
and a high HERDOO2 score, highlighting the value of using HERDOO2 for risk
stratification in women with oestrogen associated VTE.30 In contrast, in the subgroup of women of
postmenopausal age (≥50 years) with none or one of the HERDOO2 criteria who
discontinued anticoagulants, the risk of recurrent VTE was higher than expected
(point estimate 5.7%). As such, further validation of HERDOO2 is required in the
subset of postmenopausal women. Finally, we had a limited number of non-white
participants and as such our clinical decision rule should be further validated
in other populations.

Conclusion
Women with none or one of the four HERDOO2 criteria: hyperpigmentation, oedema,
or redness in either leg, D-dimer level ≥250 μg/L while using anticoagulants,
obesity with body mass index ≥30, or older age, ≥65 years) have a low risk of
recurrent VTE and can safely discontinue anticoagulants after completing short
term anticoagulants after a first unprovoked VTE event. Further research is
required to firmly establish the safety of using HERDOO2 to identify low risk
non-white women and women aged more than 50 years.

What is already known on this topic
Current practice guidelines suggest that all patients with
unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) should continue
anticoagulants long term unless they have a high risk of
bleeding

Most patients with unprovoked VTE will not, however, develop
recurrent VTE

To date, no single predictor or combination of predictors
(clinical decision rule) has been developed and validated to
identify a group of patients with unprovoked VTE at sufficiently
low risk of recurrent VTE to safely discontinue
anticoagulants

What this study adds
In the primary analysis, 17 women identified as having a low risk
of recurrent VTE using the HERDOO2 rule who discontinued
anticoagulants developed recurrent VTE during 564 patient years
of follow-up (3.0% per patient year, 95% confidence interval
1.8% to 4.8%)

Using the HERDOO2 clinical decision rule allows clinicians to
identify a large group of low risk group of women with
unprovoked VTE who can safely discontinue anticoagulants
