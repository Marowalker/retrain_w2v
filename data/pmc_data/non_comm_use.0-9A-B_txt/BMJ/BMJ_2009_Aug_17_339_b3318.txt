We have received a correction to this research paper by Martin O’Flaherty and colleagues (BMJ 2009;339:b2613, doi:10.1136/bmj.b2613). Incorrect versions of figures 1 and 3 were submitted, and the errors were not picked up during the proof stage. To ensure that correct data are available, we have redrawn these two figures and linked them to the article on bmj.com as “extra” material (see “Corrected figures”). These figures did not appear in the print version of the article.
