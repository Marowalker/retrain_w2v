==== Body
In this Research paper (BMJ 2015;350:h2958, doi:10.1136/bmj.h2958) in
Table 3, the column titled “Median (IQR) time (days)” (for Time to healing) should read
“Median (95% CI) time (days)” and the correct data for this column is 166 (113, ∞) for
prednisolone and 169 (93, ∞) for ciclosporin. This correction does not change the
conclusions of the paper or the body text.
