of infant voiding for clean catch urine within five minutes.

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting Emergency department of a tertiary paediatric hospital,
Australia.

Participants 354 infants (aged 1-12 months) requiring urine sample
collection as determined by the treating clinician. 10 infants were subsequently
excluded.

Interventions Infants were randomised to either gentle suprapubic
cutaneous stimulation (n=174) using gauze soaked in cold fluid (the Quick-Wee method)
or standard clean catch urine with no additional stimulation (n=170), for five
minutes.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome was voiding of urine within
five minutes. Secondary outcomes were successful collection of a urine sample,
contamination rate, and parental and clinician satisfaction with the method.

Results The Quick-Wee method resulted in a significantly higher rate of
voiding within five minutes compared with standard clean catch urine (31%
v 12%, P<0.001), difference in proportions 19% favouring
Quick-Wee (95% confidence interval for difference 11% to 28%). Quick-Wee had a higher
rate of successful urine sample collection (30% v 9%, P<0.001)
and greater parental and clinician satisfaction (median 2 v 3 on a 5
point Likert scale, P<0.001). The difference in contamination between Quick-Wee
and standard clean catch urine was not significant (27% v 45%,
P=0.29). The number needed to treat was 4.7 (95% confidence interval 3.4 to 7.7) to
successfully collect one additional urine sample within five minutes using Quick-Wee
compared with standard clean catch urine.

Conclusions Quick-Wee is a simple cutaneous stimulation method that
significantly increases the five minute voiding and success rate of clean catch urine
collection.

Introduction
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in young children, affecting 5-7% of febrile
children under 2 years of age.1
2 Investigation of potential UTIs should be
considered in cases of unexplained fever in this age group, as clinical signs may be
non-specific.3
4 The diagnosis of a UTI has important
implications for follow-up, and delayed treatment can result in morbidity, including
renal scarring5
6 and serious bacterial infection.7 Expedient collection of a urine sample allows for
dipstick urinalysis and microscopy screening to guide immediate clinical decision making
for treatment initiation,8 although a positive
culture result with pyuria is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.7 However, obtaining urine from pre-continent
children can be difficult and time consuming. Despite urine samples being so commonly
required in clinical practice, all current collection methods have limitations. Choosing
the method of collection must balance reliability, speed, contamination, and
invasiveness. Accordingly, clinical guidelines have differing recommendations,4
7 clinician preferences vary,9
10
11 and ongoing debate about the optimal
collection method exists in the literature.12
13

Non-invasive methods for urine collection may be regarded as practical and convenient
and acceptable for children who do not require urgent antibiotic treatment.7 Urine collection bags are often used11
14 but have unacceptably high false positive
and contamination rates.15
16 The culture results from a bag urine sample
and antibiotic sensitivities therefore cannot be used reliably to direct treatment.
Clean catch urine collection involves waiting for a nappy-free child to void
spontaneously, and it is the recommended method of urine collection by the UK National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines.4 Contamination rates of 5-27% have been reported for clean catch urine,16
17
18
19 much lower than other non-invasive
methods.15
16
19 In practice though, clean catch urine
collection can tie up valuable resources in clinical settings, with average waiting
times of 30-71 minutes,20
21 of which only 64% of first attempts are
successful.21 In contrast to the UK, the
American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend non-invasive samples can be used for
screening; but an invasive catheterisation or suprapubic aspiration sample is required
for definitive diagnosis and before starting antibiotic treatment.7 Invasive samples have lower contamination rates16 but cause pain and distress for children and
require equipment and technical expertise to collect. For these reasons invasive methods
may not be favoured by some clinicians,9
10
11 and might be impractical outside hospital
settings.13

These difficulties with urine sample collection can lead to misdiagnosis or a missed
diagnosis of UTI. One study found that 32% of children aged less than 2 years had no
urinalysis or culture performed for outpatient UTI episodes treated with
antibiotics.22 An ideal method of urine
collection would be non-invasive, fast, gentle, and simple, and such a method has been
identified as a priority for future research.7
23
24 Anecdotally, clinicians may have noted that
some children void spontaneously during the routine cleaning of the perigenital area
before urine collection. This cold, wet stimulation likely triggers cutaneous voiding
reflexes, which remain under-investigated as a mechanism for improved urine collection.
In animal studies perigenital-bladder spinal reflexes can be stimulated mechanically or
when mothers lick the perigenital skin of their newborns.25
26 In humans, suprapubic stimulation is
proposed to trigger parasympathetic detrusor contraction through the exteroceptive
somato-bladder reflex mechanism.27 We
hypothesised that gentle suprapubic cutaneous stimulation using gauze soaked in cold
fluid (the Quick-Wee method) might hasten bladder voiding for clean catch urine by
triggering early childhood cutaneous voiding reflexes. We evaluated the efficacy of this
new voiding stimulation method to increase the rate of urine voiding within five minutes
for infants in the emergency department.

Methods
The full study protocol is published and available in an open access journal.28

Trial design, participants, and setting
This was a randomised, prospective, non-blinded superiority trial, conducted from
September 2015 to April 2016 in a single tertiary paediatric emergency department at
the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne Australia. The emergency department has
85 000 presentations annually.

Eligible participants were pre-continent infants aged 1-12 months (corrected for
prematurity if <36 weeks’ gestation) where a urine sample was required and the
treating clinician determined clean catch urine to be an appropriate method of
collection. Neonates (aged <1 month) were not included as our institution does not
recommend non-invasive urine collection to investigate UTI in this age group because
of their greater risk of serious bacterial infection. We excluded infants with
anatomical or neurological abnormalities affecting voiding or sensation.

No changes to methods were made after the trial commenced. The study is reported in
accordance with the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement
for randomised trials.29

Clinicians in the emergency department (nursing and medical) were trained to recruit
participants and implement the intervention with face-to-face departmental education
sessions and written instructions. Infants suitable for inclusion were identified by
clinicians, who made decisions about the appropriate method of urine sample
collection on clinical grounds. Suitable participants were recruited
consecutively.

We assigned participants randomly, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either the intervention
(Quick-Wee) or usual care (standard clean catch urine with no additional stimulation)
for up to five minutes. An independent statistician prepared the randomisation
schedule using random permuted blocks with at least three different block sizes to
ensure concealment of allocation. Opaque envelopes concealing the allocation, within
sealed individual study packs, were used to assign the intervention in the emergency
department. Study packs were kept available from a locked study box from which they
could only be taken sequentially. Owing to the obvious nature of the intervention,
blinding was not possible after randomisation and assignment to intervention.

Interventions
The clinician provided a written study information handout, verbally explained the
procedure to the parent/carer, and obtained verbal consent.

The clinician prepared the child for the clean catch urine attempt, opened the opaque
randomisation envelope by the bedside, then immediately removed the nappy and started
the timer. A parent, carer, or clinician was ready to catch a urine sample if the
child voided, and the genital orifice was cleaned for 10 seconds with sterile water
at room temperature (standard practice). In the usual care arm the clinician waited
for the child to void spontaneously, until clean catch urine was obtained or the
timer reached five minutes. In the intervention arm the clinician (or parent/carer
with supervision) additionally rubbed the suprapubic area of the child in a circular
pattern with gauze soaked in cold saline held with disposable plastic forceps (fig
1), until clean catch urine sample was obtained or
the timer reached five minutes. One operator performed the intervention.

suprapubic stimulation using gauze soaked in cold fluid. Image courtesy of Bill
Reid, Royal Children’s Hospital creative studio

The timer was stopped if the child voided and clean catch urine was obtained, and
time to void was recorded. Alternatively a missed catch, failure to void at five
minutes, or reason for abandoning the procedure was recorded, as well as parental and
clinician satisfaction with the method. Children who were randomised and voided
during the 10 second cleaning phase (which was part of the total five minute study
period) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Standardised urogenital cleaning for both groups was performed using a designated
standard cleaning pack with 10 mL sterile water ampoules at room temperature.
Additional suprapubic cutaneous stimulation was done using a designated pack
containing disposable plastic forceps and gauze, and study labelled ampoules with 10
mL of cold 0.9% saline. The cold fluid was stored in a designated study refrigerator
with a monitored temperature of 2.8°C. Clinicians were advised to start using the
cold fluid within two minutes of removal from the refrigerator to ensure it remained
as close as possible to the designated temperature.

When clean catch urine was not obtained within the five minute trial period, the
clinician decided about the ongoing method for urine collection (continue clean catch
urine, catheter, suprapubic aspiration sample, or abandon urine collection).

Treating clinicians recorded any adverse events, and intervention could be
discontinued.30 Crying and mild distress
commonly occur with routine clean catch urine and were not regarded as an adverse
event, consistent with previous studies.18

Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was voiding of urine within five minutes (binary yes or
no outcome: voided).

Secondary outcome measures were if the child voided, whether any urine was
successfully caught in the specimen jar or was missed (binary yes or no outcome:
clean catch urine collected if voided), contamination of clean catch urine samples
obtained within five minutes (binary yes or no outcome: urine culture contamination
as per hospital laboratory definition, ≥3 colony types with colony forming units
(CFU) ≥106/L, or ≥2 colony types with CFU ≥107/L where the
predominant organism was a contaminant), and parental and clinician satisfaction with
the urine collection method (5 point Likert satisfaction rating scale).

Data collection
Clinicians in the emergency department recorded data on paper case record forms. The
data were then entered by the research team into the REDCap (Research Electronic Data
Capture) electronic database.32

Demographic and participant data recorded included age, sex, relevant medical
comorbidities, previous UTI, clinical indication for urine collection as recorded by
the clinician, and reasons for exclusions and refusals.

Clinical data recorded included whether the child voided within five minutes, and
time taken to void; successful catch of urine sample if voided; person performing the
standardised cleaning (parent, doctor, or nurse); person performing the suprapubic
stimulation in the intervention group (parent, doctor, or nurse); person catching the
urine (parent, doctor, or nurse); adverse events; whether the urine collection
attempt was abandoned before five minutes and, if so, reason for abandonment; and
parental and clinician satisfaction with the urine collection method.

Clinical data collected subsequently by the research team (by linking with laboratory
data and hospital records) included positive and contaminated urine culture results,
admission to hospital, and start of antibiotic treatment.

Sample size calculation
A sample size of 354 participants (177 in each group) was based on power calculations
using data from planned preceding baseline and pilot studies. An initial prospective
observational baseline study determined the success of standard clean catch urine in
young pre-continent children, and in preliminary data children aged <12 months 21%
(12/57) voided within five minutes.33 We
surveyed a panel of 20 expert clinicians (paediatric emergency doctors and
paediatricians at consultant level) who reported an increase in success rate of
approximately 15% compared with standard clean catch urine collection would suggest
that a simple technique such as Quick-Wee should be incorporated into their clinical
practice. A pilot study of the new method showed that Quick-Wee was a feasible and
acceptable intervention to obtain clean catch urine within five minutes.30 Thirty five per cent (7/20) of children
voided using cold temperature saline for stimulation, suggesting that a difference of
approximately 15% was a reasonable estimate of the treatment effect. Most successful
voids were from infants aged 1-12 months, an age group that was therefore chosen for
the definitive trial.

A sample size of 322 participants (161 in each group) was required to have 80% power
to detect a difference between groups of 21% (non-intervention arm) versus 35%
(intervention arm) for voiding within five minutes. Power and sample size
calculations were completed using an estimated total sample size for a two sample
proportions test (Pearson’s χ2 test). An additional 10% of participants
(16 in each group) were included to account for a small loss to follow-up of primary
outcome results. Analysis was by intention to treat, consistent with CONSORT
guidelines.29
34

Statistical analysis
For the primary outcome we report rates of voiding urine within five minutes for each
group with percentages, the absolute difference for percentage voiding between
groups, and 95% confidence intervals for each, and we calculate P values using a
χ2 test. We considered a P value <0.05 to be significant. For
secondary outcomes we report the rates of successful urine collection and
contamination for each group with percentages and 95% confidence intervals, and
median and interquartile ranges for parental and clinician satisfaction. The
appropriate difference between groups was reported (difference of proportions for
categorical outcomes, difference of medians for skewed continuous outcomes), together
with the 95% confidence interval for the difference. We estimated P values using
χ2 for categorical variables and t test or Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests for continuous variables.

In addition to the unadjusted analysis, all treatment comparisons for primary and
secondary outcomes were adjusted for age and sex to account for any chance imbalance
between the treatment groups with respect to these potentially confounding factors,
using quantile and logistic regression models for continuous and binary outcomes,
respectively. Statistical calculations and analyses were completed using Stata 14
(Stata Corp, TX). No interim analysis was performed.

Patient involvement
Feedback from the parents and carers of 40 participants in the preceding pilot study
contributed to refinement and confirmation of the study research question and outcome
measures. Parents and carers were asked to rate their satisfaction with the
intervention and could provide additional comments. Parental satisfaction with the
intervention in the pilot study was high and no respondents were dissatisfied with
the intervention,30 demonstrating
feasibility for this larger definitive trial.

Patients were not further involved in the design, recruitment, and conduct of the
study. The burden of intervention was assessed with a parental satisfaction rating
using a 5 point Likert scale, which was a secondary outcome measure of this study.
Results of this study will be available to the wider community, including study
participants, through publication in an open access journal.

Results
Overall, 354 participants were recruited and 10 were excluded (fig 2): five were aged less than 1 month, four were aged more than 12 months,
and one had topical anaesthetic cream applied for a suprapubic aspiration procedure that
affected sensation. One family declined consent to randomisation, and three families
withdrew consent and requested sample collection by another method (one in the control
group and two in the intervention group). No adverse events occurred during the trial,
and no participants had missing primary outcome data. Two infants (0.6% of participants)
in the intervention group voided during the 10 second cleaning procedure and were
included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Fig 2 Flow of participants through study

Of 344 participants included in the analysis, 172 (50%) were male with a mean age of 5.4
months (table 1). Clinical indications (could be ≥1)
for urine collection were predominantly fever of unknown origin (n=144, 42%), unsettled
baby (n=132, 38%), poor feeding (n=76, 22%), specifically suspected UTI (n=60, 17%), and
vomiting (n=27, 8%). Thirty three infants (10%) had medical comorbidities (table 1). A UTI was present in eight of 55 infants (14%) with
laboratory culture results available, defined as growth of a uropathogenic organism with
CFU ≥108/L.

A total of 127 clinicians recruited one or more participants for the trial (n=60 (47%)
nursing, n=67 (53%) medical), and subsequently allocated roles for the procedure.
Clinicians primarily performed the routine urogenital cleaning of the 354 infants in the
trial (n=152 (43%) nursing, n=174 (49%) medical, n=28 (8%) parent) and the Quick-Wee
method for the 174 infants in the intervention group (n=89 (51%) nursing, n=82 (47%)
medical, n=3 (2%) parent). Parents primarily collected the urine of the 74 infants who
voided within the five minute trial period (n=13 (18%) nursing, n=8 (11%) medical, n=46
(62%) parent, n=7 (9%) not recorded).

Compared with standard clean catch urine, Quick-Wee had a higher rate of voiding within
five minutes (table 2). In total, 54 out of 174
infants (31%) voided within five minutes in the Quick-Wee group, compared with 20 out of
170 (12%) in the standard clean catch urine group. The difference in proportions for the
primary outcome was 19% favouring Quick-Wee (95% confidence interval for difference 11%
to 28%), with a risk ratio of 2.6.

Compared with standard clean catch urine, Quick-Wee had a similarly higher rate for
successfully catching a urine sample and also higher parental and clinician satisfaction
with the method of urine sample collection (table 2).
The rate of contamination between groups was not statistically significant, with lower
numbers for this outcome because not all participants had a urine sample processed for
culture (table 2). The number needed to treat to
successfully collect one additional urine sample within five minutes using Quick-Wee
compared with standard clean catch urine was 4.7 (95% confidence interval 3.4 to
7.7).

After adjustment for age and sex the primary outcome results were unchanged (data not
shown). Risk difference and confidence intervals for successfully catching urine and for
contamination, and difference in medians for parental and clinician satisfaction with
the method, were also unchanged when adjusted for age and sex.

Discussion
Gentle suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with gauze soaked in cold fluid (the Quick-Wee
method) led to a clinically and statistically significant increase in voiding and
successful urine collection within five minutes for infants aged 1-12 months. The
difference in contamination was not significant as confidence intervals overlapped,
potentially due to lower numbers of available culture results. Importantly, parents and
clinicians preferred the Quick-Wee method, reporting higher satisfaction than with
standard clean catch urine.

Strengths and limitations of this study
To our knowledge this is the first randomised trial to demonstrate the efficacy of a
voiding stimulation method for infants. Strengths of this study include the preceding
baseline and pilot feasibility studies, its large sample size, and randomised study
design. More than 100 clinicians in the emergency department rather than dedicated
research staff performed the intervention, and all eligible infants were included
regardless of feeding and hydration state, minimising selection bias and ensuring the
generalisability of results. The method is simple and does not require any
specialised equipment so it can be utilised in low resource settings as a successful
example of frugal innovation.35 This study
has some limitations. Given the obvious nature of the method it would not be possible
to blind clinicians to the intervention. Neonates and pre-continent children aged
more than 12 months were not included in the study.

Comparison to other studies
Previous randomised studies have examined novel methods to obtain more rapid clean
catch urine in pre-continent children. These include a vibrating bladder stimulator
for infants and toddlers in the emergency department (not effective)20 and lumbar/bladder stimulation for neonates
in the neonatal intensive care unit (effective but limited to neonatal age group and
setting).18

Three decades ago Taylor et al tested the concept of triggering voiding using a
finger tap method, although this study was limited by not recording the time taken to
void in over half the infants in the study and by lacking a comparison group.36 The lumbar/bladder stimulation method
subsequently described by Herreros et al has been shown to have a promising success
rate of 78-86% for clean catch urine within five minutes in a neonatal intensive care
setting.18
31 However, participants in these studies
had a mean age of 7 or less days, urine was predominantly collected for reasons other
than investigation of UTI or fever, and infants with poor hydration and feeding were
excluded. This may limit the generalisability of these findings to children in the
primary or acute care setting, who are predominantly older and often unwell and
poorly hydrated when a UTI is suspected. The lumbar/bladder stimulation method also
requires infants to be held up suspended under the arms while stimulation manoeuvres
are performed and catching a sample is attempted. This technique requires two or
three staff members,18
23
31 and may be less feasible in larger and
heavier infants.37

The lumbar/bladder stimulation method has recently been investigated in three
non-randomised trials for infants in the emergency department and was found to have a
lower success rate in this population. Valleix et al obtained clean catch urine
within five minutes in 27% of pre-continent children aged more than 1 month, with
difficulties managing the children’s position in 46% of the participants.37 Labrosse et al obtained clean catch urine
within five minutes in 49% of younger infants aged less than 6 months.38 Tran et al used a different method of two
three-minute stimulation attempts separated by a 30 minute interval of bag urine
collection during which the infant was given water, formula milk, or breast
milk.23 Although results are thus not
directly comparable, the study found an overall success rate of 40.9% for 142
non-ambulant infants aged less than 2 years, which reduced with age, from 88.9%
(newborn) to 28.6% (age >1 year). All three studies reported greater success in
younger infants. This reduced potency in older infants may be expected given the
hypothesis of stimulating newborn cutaneous voiding reflexes, which diminish with
age.39

The contamination rate for the Quick-Wee method (27%) is similar to that reported in
previous voiding stimulation studies (16%,38
24%,18 and 38%23). Exact microbiological definitions of contamination,
however, are not established in the literature and guidelines and vary between
laboratories and institutions and thus may not be directly comparable. Clinical
decisions about specimen collection and treatment in the presence of contamination
should consider the clinical context, urinalysis, and the presence or absence of
pyuria on microscopy.

Cold thermal stimulation has been suggested to pose a risk of cold burns to sensitive
skin20; however, in the 174 infants in
the intervention arm of the current study there were no such adverse events and there
was high parental and clinician satisfaction associated with stimulation using gauze
soaked in cold fluid refrigerated to a temperature of 2.8°C.

Unanswered questions and future research
This trial used gauze soaked in cold fluid for stimulation over a period of five
minutes. We used saline for the stimulation fluid so that ampoules could be easily
identified in the trial, but any clean cold fluid could be used. Although our pilot
study suggested that cold stimulus was more effective than stimulus at room
temperature,30 future trials examining
the temperature of stimulation applied to trigger voiding or a repeated application
of the stimulation may further enhance the success of this method. Children in the
neonatal age range were not included in the trial, but younger infants have been
shown to be more responsive to stimulation of newborn cutaneous voiding
reflexes.23
37
38 This method could be further evaluated
for neonatal patients where urine is being collected for reasons other than
investigation of a UTI. We hypothesised that stimulating faster and more forceful
voiding may reduce sample contamination, and although contamination was lower with
the intervention this did not reach statistical significance. Contamination of clean
catch urine may be related to urine flushing of the foreskin or vagina, which is seen
on micturating cystourethrogram,40 and
higher contamination has been found from initial void rather than midstream
samples.41 Future research to further
reduce the contamination of clean catch urine by incidental skin flora, such as
through standardised methods to clean the perigenital area,42 may be of additional benefit.

Conclusions and implications for clinicians and policy makers
UTI is common in unwell young children presenting to primary and acute care, but
reaching or excluding the diagnosis is not straightforward.2
43
44 Collecting urine samples from young
pre-continent children is challenging and the limitations of existing methods are
well known. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on UTI
recommend clean catch urine collection, although in practice, attempts can be time
consuming or unsuccessful.21 Voiding
stimulation methods such as Quick-Wee can enhance clean catch urine collection by
increasing the speed and success of obtaining urine. Timely collection of specimens
is important and has many benefits, including expediting patient progress and
clinical decision making in primary and acute care settings, reducing unnecessary or
broad spectrum antibiotic treatment,22
preventing morbidity from UTI, and limiting unnecessary representation and follow-up
to health services for missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Voiding stimulation methods
could be easily incorporated into urine collection strategies in guidelines and
clinical practice where non-invasive collection is indicated. Where appropriate this
may spare some children the pain and distress associated with catheter and suprapubic
aspiration procedures. The Quick-Wee method requires minimal resources and is a
simple way to trigger faster voiding for clean catch urine from infants in the acute
care setting.

What is already known on this topic
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common early childhood febrile
illness, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis or exclusion

Urine sample collection can be challenging in pre-continent children, and
current collection methods have limitations

The clean catch urine collection method is recommended by UK NICE
guidelines, but can be time consuming or unsuccessful

What this study adds
A simple suprapubic cutaneous stimulation method using gauze soaked in
cold fluid to trigger voiding (the “Quick-Wee” method) significantly
increased the voiding and success rate of clean catch urine for infants
aged 1-12 months

The Quick-Wee method requires minimal resources and is a simple way to
trigger faster voiding for clean catch urine from infants in the acute
care setting

We thank the families and clinical staff participating in this trial. The Murdoch
Children’s Research Institute and the Melbourne Children’s Trial Centre assisted
with the study design, data management, and analysis and interpretation of data
for this study. Staff from the emergency department of the Royal Children’s
Hospital assisted with participant recruitment.

Contributors: PAB and FEB are joint senior authors. JK had the original idea for
the study, and all authors contributed to the trial design and plan. JK and FEB
were responsible for obtaining trial funding. JK, PF, ST, SH, and FB were
responsible for supervising the study and data acquisition in the emergency
department. JK and SMD carried out the statistical analysis. JK drafted the
manuscript, which was revised by all authors. JK and FEB are guarantors.

Funding: This study was funded by a philanthropic research project grant from the
Shepherd Foundation. The foundation was independent of this trial and its
researchers and had no part in the study design, data collection, data
interpretation and analysis, writing of the manuscript, or decision to submit the
manuscript for publication. JK has been part funded by an Avant doctor in training
research scholarship and Royal Australasian College of Physicians Basser research
entry scholarship. FEB is supported in part by a National Health and Medical
Research Council Centre of Excellence research grant for paediatric emergency
medicine (GNT 1058560) and a Royal Children’s Hospital foundation grant, Melbourne
Australia. The Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne receives infrastructure support
