In this Research paper by Tobias Kurth and colleagues (BMJ 2009;338:b2392, doi:10.1136/bmj.b2392) one author’s affiliation details were incorrect in the full version of the paper on bmj.com. Paul M Ridker’s details should have been: “professor1,2,6,7 [not professor1,2,5,6]”—that is, he is affiliated with (1) Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston MA, USA; (2) Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health; (6) Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, Brigham and Women’s Hospital; and (7) Donald W Reynolds Center for Cardiovascular Research, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The details in the summary of the paper in the print issue of 4 July are correct.
