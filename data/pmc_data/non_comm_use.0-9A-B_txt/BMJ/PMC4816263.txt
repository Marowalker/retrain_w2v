meta-analyses to fill the gaps in knowledge on potassium intake and health.

Data sources Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
Medline, Embase, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Latin
American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database, and the reference
lists of previous reviews.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies
reporting the effects of potassium intake on blood pressure, renal function,
blood lipids, catecholamine concentrations, all cause mortality, cardiovascular
disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease were included.

Data extraction and synthesis Potential studies were independently
screened in duplicate, and their characteristics and outcomes were extracted.
When possible, meta-analysis was done to estimate the effects (mean difference
or risk ratio with 95% confidence interval) of higher potassium intake by using
the inverse variance method and a random effect model.

Results 22 randomised controlled trials (including 1606
participants) reporting blood pressure, blood lipids, catecholamine
concentrations, and renal function and 11 cohort studies (127 038 participants)
reporting all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or coronary heart
disease in adults were included in the meta-analyses. Increased potassium intake
reduced systolic blood pressure by 3.49 (95% confidence interval 1.82 to 5.15)
mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.96 (0.86 to 3.06) mm Hg in adults, an
effect seen in people with hypertension but not in those without hypertension.
Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7.16 (1.91 to 12.41) mm Hg when the
higher potassium intake was 90-120 mmol/day, without any dose response.
Increased potassium intake had no significant adverse effect on renal function,
blood lipids, or catecholamine concentrations in adults. An inverse
statistically significant association was seen between potassium intake and risk
of incident stroke (risk ratio 0.76, 0.66 to 0.89). Associations between
potassium intake and incident cardiovascular disease (risk ratio 0.88, 0.70 to
1.11) or coronary heart disease (0.96, 0.78 to 1.19) were not statistically
significant. In children, three controlled trials and one cohort study suggested
that increased potassium intake reduced systolic blood pressure by a
non-significant 0.28 (−0.49 to 1.05) mm Hg.

Conclusions High quality evidence shows that increased potassium
intake reduces blood pressure in people with hypertension and has no adverse
effect on blood lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, or renal
function in adults. Higher potassium intake was associated with a 24% lower risk
of stroke (moderate quality evidence). These results suggest that increased
potassium intake is potentially beneficial to most people without impaired renal
handling of potassium for the prevention and control of elevated blood pressure
and stroke.

Introduction
Non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death globally, killing more
people each year than all other causes combined.1
2
3 Elevated blood pressure and hypertension
are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart
disease, stroke, and heart failure, as well as renal failure.4 Although non-communicable diseases disproportionately affect
adults, they and their risk factors are becoming more prevalent in paediatric
populations. Diet related non-communicable diseases may take years or decades to
manifest, and delaying the onset of these diseases could improve lives and result in
substantial cost savings.5
6 Much of the human and social impact caused
each year by morbidity and mortality related to non-communicable diseases could be
averted through interventions that are well understood, cost effective, and
feasible.1

Potassium is an essential nutrient that is needed for maintenance of total body fluid
volume, acid and electrolyte balance, and normal cell function.7 In the pre-agricultural and post-agricultural diets of our
human ancestors, potassium intake was very high, often exceeding 200 mmol/day.8 In modern society, these levels have been
markedly reduced. Food processing reduces the potassium content of food, and a diet
high in processed foods and low in fresh fruits and vegetables is often lacking in
potassium.8 Data from around the world
suggest that the average potassium consumption in many countries is below 70-80
mmol/day,9 the value recommended by the
2002 Joint World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization Expert
Consultation,10 and even fewer
countries report an average consumption of 90 mmol/day as recommended by countries
such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, and Belgium.11
12
13
14 No countries report an average
population consumption of 120 mmol/day as recommended by the United States, Canada,
Republic of Korea, and Bulgaria.15
16
17 Lower potassium consumption has been
associated with elevated blood pressure, hypertension,18 and stroke,19 and
higher levels of consumption could be protective against these conditions.10

Public health interventions aimed at increasing potassium intake from food are,
therefore, potential cost effective measures for reducing the burden of morbidity
and mortality from non-communicable diseases. However, the evidence on the potential
beneficial effect of increased potassium on blood pressure and cardiovascular
disease is not entirely consistent. Three systematic reviews with meta-analyses, all
published 10 or more years ago, suggest that increased potassium intake lowers blood
pressure in adults with and without hypertension.20
21
22 Another systematic review without
meta-analysis also concluded that increased potassium decreased blood pressure in
adults.23 However, one meta-analysis of
studies that included only people with hypertension reported no significant effect
of increased potassium intake on blood pressure.24 A recent meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies reported an inverse
association between potassium intake and risk of stroke but found no association
with cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease.19 No systematic reviews have looked at the effect of
increased potassium intake on potential adverse effects such as changes in blood
lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, and renal function in adults or
children, or of the effect of increased potassium intake on blood pressure in
children. Additionally, none of the previous reviews or meta-analyses attempted to
determine the optimal level of intake of potassium for maximum health benefits.

To inform the development of its guideline on potassium intake, the WHO initiated
this review to systematically compile results from studies in apparently healthy
adults and children without acute illnesses or renal impairment that could
compromise handling of potassium and to conduct meta-analyses to answer the
following questions. (1) What is the effect of increased potassium intake compared
with lower intake on blood pressure, all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease,
stroke, and coronary heart disease in apparently healthy adults? (2) What is the
effect of increased potassium intake on blood pressure in apparently healthy
children? (3) What is the effect of increased potassium intake on the potential
adverse effects of changes in blood lipid concentrations, catecholamine
concentrations, and renal function in apparently healthy adults and children? (4)
What is the level of potassium intake that results in the maximum benefit on blood
pressure and risk of mortality and cardiovascular diseases? (5) Is the effect of
increased potassium differentially affected by the hypertension status of the
population, sex, average sodium or potassium intake at baseline, type of
intervention, type of device or method used to measure blood pressure, study design,
or duration of intervention?

Methods
We conducted this review according to the methods recommended by the Cochrane
Collaboration and documented the process and results in accordance with the
preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)
statement for reporting systematic reviews.25
26

Outcome data
The primary outcomes of interest in adults were blood pressure, all cause
mortality, and all incident, fatal, and non-fatal cardiovascular disease,
stroke, and coronary heart disease. We also examined potential adverse effects
such as changes in blood lipid concentrations (total cholesterol, low density
lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride
concentrations), catecholamine concentrations, and renal function and any other
adverse effects reported by study authors. The primary outcomes in children were
blood pressure and the potential adverse effects of changes in blood lipids or
catecholamine concentrations and any other adverse effects reported by study
authors.

Inclusion criteria
We planned to include only randomised controlled trials (both individual and
cluster randomised). Knowing that some outcomes would probably not have at least
three studies meeting the inclusion criteria, we decided a priori that in the
event of an insufficient number of randomised controlled trials for a given
outcome (less than three), we would include quasi-randomised trials,
non-randomised trials, and prospective observational cohort studies. Randomised
and non-randomised controlled trials must have allocated at least one group of
participants to increased potassium intake (intervention) and one group to lower
potassium intake (control) for at least four weeks. Cohort studies must have had
a prospective design that measured potassium intake as the exposure and reported
at least one of the outcomes of interest after at least one year of follow-up.
Randomised controlled trials (but not cohort studies) had to use urinary
potassium excretion from 24 hour urine collections to estimate actual potassium
intake. The controlled trials could not have concomitant interventions (that is,
non-drug interventions, antihypertensive drugs, or other drugs) in the
intervention group unless those interventions were also applied to the control
group, so the only difference between the groups was the level of potassium
intake. We excluded studies targeting acutely ill or HIV positive people, people
admitted to hospital, or people with impaired urinary potassium excretion due to
a medical condition or drug treatment.

Search strategy
We first searched the literature for high quality systematic reviews of
randomised controlled trials or cohort studies on the effect of increased
potassium intake relative to lower potassium intake on the outcomes of interest.
We examined the reference lists of included studies of an identified review if
the inclusion criteria were in agreement with, or were broader than, the
inclusion criteria defined for the specific objectives of our review. We
reviewed each original reference and compared it against the inclusion criteria
for our review and included those that met our inclusion criteria.

We did a complete search of the literature on potassium intake and the outcomes
of interest published since the data search of the identified systematic
review(s). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (6
September 2011), Medline (28 August 2011), Embase (25 August 2011), the WHO
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (1 September 2011), and the
Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS) (1
September 2011). Our search had no language restrictions or additional limits.
We examined the reference lists of included studies for additional studies. Two
reviewers independently screened the output of the search to identify
potentially eligible studies. Complete data search terms can be found in the
supplementary material (online supporting materials (OSM) 1).

Data extraction, risk of bias, and quality assessment
Two reviewers independently extracted relevant population and intervention
characteristics of each study by using a standard data extraction form. A third
reviewer checked extracted data, and all disagreements were resolved through
consensus. We requested any relevant missing information from the original study
authors. In the case of duplicate publications and companion papers of a primary
publication, we evaluated all available data to maximise the yield of
information.

For randomised controlled trials, we assessed the risk of bias associated with
the method of sequence generation (possible selection bias), allocation
concealment (possible selection bias), blinding (possible performance bias),
selective reporting (possible selective reporting bias), loss to follow-up
(possible attrition bias), and completeness of reporting outcome data (possible
attrition bias). In cohort studies, we additionally evaluated the risk of bias
associated with methods of measuring exposure (possible bias due to confounding
or contamination), collecting outcome data (possible bias due to inadequate
duration of exposure and performance bias), and selecting study participants
(possible bias due to lack of comparability between groups). We rated the risk
of bias as being low, unclear, or high according to established criteria.25
27

We used funnel plots to assess for the presence of small study bias.28
29 We generated “risk of bias graph”
and “risk of bias summary” figures for each study type separately in adults and
children. We used GRADEProfiler software (version 3.6) to assess the quality of
the body of evidence according to the methodology of grading of recommendations
assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE).30

Statistical analysis
One reviewer entered data into Review Manager software (Copenhagen, 2011), and a
second reviewer checked data entry for accuracy. In cases of disagreement, a
third reviewer also evaluated the data and all reviewers made a conclusion based
on consensus.

In the randomised controlled trials conducted in adults, we estimated potassium
intake from 24 hour urinary excretion by using a conversion factor of 1.3.31

We calculated an overall effect estimate for all dichotomous data as a risk ratio
with 95% confidence interval. We extracted dichotomous data in the form of a
risk ratio or a hazard ratio from each original cohort study by using the
statistical models that controlled for the greatest number of covariates (to
reduce bias) without controlling for blood pressure, because blood pressure
explains some of the effect that potassium has on non-communicable disease
related outcomes. We compared the risk of each outcome in the group with the
highest potassium intake against that of the group with the lowest potassium
intake (reference group) to generate an overall effect estimate. We did a
subgroup analysis to test the effect of different levels of intake on outcomes
and used different intake levels from the same study compared with the same
reference group but did not pool the subgroups.

For randomised controlled trials, we generated an overall effect estimate for all
continuous variables by using the difference in means, with 95% confidence
intervals, between the intervention and the control groups. When a trial had
more than one intervention group but only one control group, we used the group
with the highest potassium intake in the analysis.

When original study authors assessed outcomes at more than one time point, we
included the data from the latest time point in overall analyses and used data
from all relevant time points in the subgroup analysis based on study duration.
We used the inverse variance method random effects meta-analysis to combine data
and generate the overall effect estimate.32 For all analyses, we considered results to be statistically
significant at α=0.05.

We assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots and with the
I2 statistic quantifying inconsistency across studies.33
34 We considered an I2
statistic of 75% or greater to be an important level of inconsistency. When we
found heterogeneity, we combined data in a meta-analysis, noted the
heterogeneity, and examined characteristics of individual studies and subgroups
and attempted to explain the heterogeneity.

We defined the following subgroups during the protocol development with input
from the WHO Nutrition Guidelines Expert Advisory Group to test specific
objectives: achieved potassium intake in intervention or comparison group
(<90 mmol/day v 90-120 mmol/day v 120-155
mmol/day v >155 mmol/day) (note: original studies reported
urinary potassium excretion; using a conversion factor of 1.3),31 70 mmol/day urinary potassium equals
approximately 90 mmol/day potassium intake, 90 mmol/day urinary potassium equals
120 mmol/day intake, and 120 mmol/day urinary potassium equals 155 mmol/day
intake); achieved difference in potassium intake between intervention or
comparison and control (<30 mmol/day v 30-60 mmol/day
v >60 mmol/day); average potassium intake at baseline
(<50 mmol/day v 50-80 mmol/day v >80
mmol/day); average sodium intake at baseline (< 2 g/day v
2-4 g/day v >4 g/day); hypertensive status of participants
at baseline (with hypertension v without hypertension
v undetermined or mixed); and sex (male v
female v mixed). Additional subgroups in randomised controlled
trials only were: type of intervention (diet or feeding v
supplementation v advice); type of device used to measure blood
pressure (automatic v manual); method of measurement of blood
pressure (supine office v seated office v
standing office v unspecified); study design (parallel
v crossover); and duration of intervention (<2 months
v 2-4 months v >4 months). We also
planned to use these subgroups to examine reasons for heterogeneity. 

We did a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of removing studies at high
risk of bias from the analysis. For randomised controlled trials, we considered
a study to be at high risk of bias if it was graded as inadequate in both the
randomisation and concealment of allocation and in either blinding or loss to
follow-up. For cohort studies, we considered a study to be at high risk of bias
if the measurement method for estimating potassium intake was a single 24 hour
dietary recall or if the study had high risk of confounding for both measurement
method and a second reason.

Search results
We identified 5310 publications reporting on blood pressure, blood lipids, or
catecholamine concentrations in adults or children or on renal function, all
cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or coronary heart disease in
adults. Of these, we found 5250 in the electronic search and 60 in the
references from published systematic reviews or other sources.19

24 After we eliminated duplicate
publications, clearly irrelevant publications, and studies that did not reach
basic inclusion criteria, we assessed 75 full text publications for eligibility.
We excluded 31 studies on full text review. We could not determine the
eligibility of seven randomised controlled trials from the published
manuscripts; we requested additional information that we have not yet

Because of the sparseness of data in children, we reassessed the 17 potentially
eligible abstracts in children with broader inclusion criteria including more
than three weeks’ duration and any controlled design. We excluded 11 abstracts
and assessed six full text articles for eligibility. We excluded four: one was
cross sectional, one did not report an outcome of interest, and two did not
report original data. We included two additional studies: one randomised
controlled trial of three weeks’ duration and one non-randomised controlled
trial.79
80 Therefore, we included four studies
in children: two randomised and one non-randomised controlled trials and one
cohort study.

Randomised controlled trials in adults were conducted in Australia, Chile, China,
Germany, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Study duration ranged
from four weeks to 12 months. A total of 1606 participants were included, with
individual study sizes ranging from 12 to 353. The intervention in one study was
dietary advice or education, as well as a tablet supplement. In two studies, the
intervention was dietary advice or education alone. The intervention in the
remaining 20 studies was the provision of potassium supplements. For study
characteristics, see supplementary material (OSM2).

The 12 cohort studies in adults were conducted in Finland, Japan, the
Netherlands, Scotland, Taiwan, and the United States; one study included
participants from 40 countries. One study did not report variance estimates and
was, therefore, not included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, a total
of 127 038 participants were included, with sample sizes ranging from 443 to
38 726 in individual studies. All cohort studies divided the sample population
on the basis of potassium intake at baseline and measured all cause mortality or
incident, fatal, or non-fatal cardiovascular disease, stroke, or coronary heart
disease over time.

In children, the three controlled trials were conducted in the United States and
the one cohort study in the Netherlands. The two randomised trials included a
total of 250 boys and girls aged 13-15 years. The non-randomised controlled
trial included 76 adolescents aged 11-14 years. The cohort study measured 596
children 5-17 years of age at baseline, and 253 were re-measured at the seven
year follow-up.

Effect estimates
Blood pressure in adults
Twenty one randomised controlled trials contributed 21 comparisons to the
meta-analyses of resting blood pressure in adults. Increased potassium
intake reduced systolic blood pressure by 5.93 (95% confidence interval 1.70
to 10.15) mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.78 (1.43 to 6.13) mm Hg.
Heterogeneity was present in both analyses: I2=96% for the
systolic blood pressure analysis and I2=93% for the diastolic
blood pressure analysis. We independently removed each study from the
analyses to explore the effect on the heterogeneity. We were able to reduce
the I2 to 65% in the systolic blood pressure analysis by removing
one study,52 and we reduced
I2 to 55% in the diastolic analysis by removing two
studies.51
52 Increased potassium intake
reduced systolic blood pressure by 3.49 (1.82 to 5.15) mm Hg (fig 2) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.96 (0.86
to 3.06) mm Hg (fig 3).

systolic blood pressure in adults: by hypertension status and
total

Fig 3 Effect of increased potassium intake on resting
diastolic blood pressure in adults: by hypertension status and
total

Table 1 contains results from subgroup
analyses. Subgrouping by baseline hypertension status explained most of the
remaining heterogeneity (figures 2 and
3). Increased potassium intake
significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the 16
studies targeting people with hypertension (systolic blood pressure 5.32
(3.43 to 7.20) mm Hg; diastolic 3.10 (1.66 to 4.53) mm Hg) but not the three
studies targeting people without hypertension (systolic 0.09 (−0.77 to 0.95)
mm Hg; diastolic (0.56 (−0.42 to 1.55) mm Hg). When we sub-grouped studies
by achieved potassium intake, we found that when the increased potassium
group consumed 90-120 mmol/day, the reduction in systolic (7.16 (1.91 to
12.41) mm Hg) and diastolic (4.01 (−0.42 to 8.44) mm Hg) blood pressure was
larger than in any other intake group, although the groups were not
statistically different from one another and no clear dose response was
apparent.

†Potassium intake was measured through 24 hour urinary potassium
excretion and estimated from urinary excretion by using conversion
factor of 1.3.31


Our other subgroup analyses showed that increased potassium intake decreased
systolic blood pressure regardless of baseline potassium intake, blood
pressure measurement device, blood pressure measurement method, the
population status of use of drugs to control blood pressure, the
intervention type, or the study design. When we sub-grouped studies
according to the reported population sodium intake, the greatest decrease in
systolic blood pressure (6.91 (2.29 to 11.53) mm Hg) was seen in the group
of studies with the highest sodium consumption (>4 g sodium/day);
however, this decrease was not significantly greater than the decrease in
the group of studies in which the population consumed 2-4 g sodium/day (1.97
(0.52 to 3.41) mm Hg). Increased potassium intake decreased systolic blood
pressure in studies of a duration of less than two months (3.36 (1.78 to
4.94) mm Hg,) or 2-4 months (3.83 (0.95 to 6.72) mm Hg). Only three studies
had a duration of more than four months,44
46
48 two of which were in people
without hypertension,44
46 and increased potassium did not
significantly reduce blood pressure in this group of studies (−0.02 (−0.90
to 0.85) mm Hg). Reductions in diastolic blood pressure in the subgroup
analyses were less pronounced but similar to those of systolic blood
pressure.

All cause mortality and disease endpoints in adults
The meta-analysis of nine cohort studies with nine comparisons detected a
protective effect of higher potassium intake on risk of incident stroke
(risk ratio 0.76, 0.66 to 0.89). The risk of incident stroke was the least
when the intake of potassium in the comparison group was 90-120 mmol/day
(risk ratio 0.70, 0.56 to 0.88), although it was not significantly different
from the result when the potassium intake was <90 mmol/day (0.82, 0.71 to
0.93). Potassium intake had a non-significant relation with incident
cardiovascular disease (risk ratio 0.88, 0.70 to 1.10) and coronary heart
disease (0.96, 0.78 to 1.19) (fig 4). Two
cohort studies reported all cause mortality; however, the results could not
be combined in a meta-analysis because one study did not report an estimate
of variance.42 That study reported
a relative risk of death of 0.58 for the 80th centile versus the 20th
centile of potassium intake, but statistical significance was not reported.
The second study had inconclusive results (risk ratio 1.08, 0.91 to 1.29)
when calculating the risk for every increase of one in standard deviation
(45 mmol/day) in intake of potassium.

risk of incident cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart
disease in adults

Potential adverse effects in adults
Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials reporting changes in blood
lipids showed no significant adverse effect of increased potassium on total
cholesterol (mean difference −0.12 (−0.33 to 0.09) mmol/L), low density
lipoprotein cholesterol (−0.10 (−0.38 to 0.18) mmol/L), high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (−0.01 (−0.13 to 0.11) mmol/L), or triglyceride
concentrations (−0.11 (−0.48 to 0.26) mmol/L) (fig 5). No studies measured urinary catecholamine concentrations.
The meta-analyses of three randomised controlled trials reporting plasma
catecholamine concentrations detected no effect of increased potassium
intake on plasma adrenaline (−3.94 (−9.22 to 1.34) pg/mL) or plasma
noradrenaline (−4.32 (−23.78 to 15.13) pg/mL). Three studies measured renal
function by serum creatinine, and the meta-analysis showed that increased
potassium intake decreased serum creatinine by a non-significant 4.86 (−3.87
to 13.59) µmol/L. No studies reported minor side effects or other potential
adverse effects from increased potassium intake.

lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, and renal
function in adults

Blood pressure and potential adverse effects in children
In the meta-analyses of the three randomised controlled trials with five
comparisons in children, increased potassium intake decreased systolic blood
pressure by a non-significant 0.28 (−0.49 to 1.05) mm Hg (fig 6) and diastolic blood pressure by 0.92 (−0.16
to 2.00) mm Hg. In the cohort study, potassium intake was inversely related
to the rate of increase in blood pressure over a seven year period; the
highest third of potassium intake had a 1.00 (0.35 to 1.65) mm Hg per year
lower increase in blood pressure than the lowest third.78 No studies that met the inclusion criteria
reported the effect of increased potassium intake on blood lipid
concentrations, catecholamine concentrations or other adverse effects in
children.

systolic blood pressure in children. Sinaiko 1993 reported results
for boys and girls separately, and Wilson 1996 reported results for
two groups separately on basis of their change in blood pressure

Quality of body of evidence
The funnel plots of the set of studies in adults do not confirm small study bias;
however, they also do not provide clear evidence of no small study bias in the
set of studies in adults, so some small study bias may exist (see supplementary
materials OSM3). In children, the number of studies was insufficient to generate
meaningful funnel plots. The summary and graph of the assessment of other risk
of bias (OSM4 and OSM5) suggest that the entire body of evidence in adults was
not at high risk of bias. One randomised controlled trial in adults was at high
risk of bias61; however, only five
studies reported the method of random sequence generation and allocation
concealment.46
57
58
61
64 The body of evidence in children was
at high risk of bias. Of the four studies, one was a cohort study,78 and one was not randomised.80 Only one study reported blinding of
personnel and participants,77 and two
studies did not blind personnel and participants.79
80 In all studies in children, whether
the outcome assessors were blinded was unclear.77

According to the assessment of quality of evidence by GRADE methods,30 the evidence for increased potassium
reducing blood pressure in adults was of high or moderate quality (table 2). The evidence of no effect of increased
potassium on blood lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, or renal
function was of high quality. The quality of evidence was not downgraded for any
reason. The direct evidence for a protective effect of higher potassium intake
on incident stroke was low because cohort studies began on the GRADE ranking as
low quality and it was not downgraded for any reason. The quality of the direct
evidence for an effect of potassium intake level on incident cardiovascular
disease and coronary heart disease was very low. In both cases, the quality of
evidence began as low because of the cohort study design and was downgraded
owing to imprecision (that is, the 95% confidence interval of the effect
estimate crossed one). The low and very low quality of this evidence reflects
that the GRADE method defines observational evidence from cohort studies as low
quality. Recognising the limitations of any biomarker, we considered data on
change in systolic blood pressure as indirect evidence regarding the effect of
sodium intake on risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart
disease. Blood pressure is recognised as a reliable biomarker for estimating
risk of cardiovascular disease,81
82 because of the well established
relation between increasing blood pressure and increasing risk of cardiovascular
diseases, especially coronary heart disease and stroke.4
83 We downgraded the data owing to
indirectness (that is, use of a proxy indicator).

†Composite cardiovascular disease as reported by original study authors.
This variable included some or all of fatal and non-fatal stroke;
coronary heart disease; myocardial infarction; congestive cardiac
failure; or episode of coronary revascularisation, bypass grafting, or
angioplasty.

‡Data from systolic blood pressure used as evidence for effect of
potassium intake on risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary
heart because blood pressure is good proxy indicator for risk of these
outcomes.45-47

§Additional evidence on relation between potassium intake and blood
lipids comes from meta-analysis of 2 randomised controlled trials with 2
comparisons reporting high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration
supportive of no effect of increased potassium in blood lipids (MD 0.01
mmol/L lower, 0.13 lower to 0.11 higher) (quality of evidence high) and
meta-analysis of 2 randomised controlled trials with 2 comparisons
reporting triglyceride concentration supportive of no effect of
increased potassium on blood lipids (MD 0.11 mmol/L lower, 0.48 lower to
0.26 higher) (quality of evidence high). Only one randomised controlled
trial in literature reported low density lipoprotein concentration; it
was consistent with no effect of increased potassium on blood lipids (MD
0.10 mmol/L lower, 0.38 lower to 0.18 higher).

¶Meta-analysis of 3 randomised controlled trials with 3 comparisons
reporting plasma adrenaline concentration is supportive of no effect of
increased potassium on catecholamine concentrations (MD 3.94 pg/mL
lower, 9.22 lower to 1.34 higher) (quality of evidence high). No studies
reporting urinary catecholamine concentrations were found.

According to the GRADE assessment,30 the
quality of evidence in children showing that increased potassium intake reduces
systolic and diastolic blood pressure was low (table 3). We downgraded the controlled trials because of a high risk of
bias as described previously and imprecision (95% confidence interval of effect
estimate crossed zero). We did not downgrade the cohort study for any reason but
assessed it as low quality because of the study design, as per GRADE guidance.
We used the data from the systematic review conducted in adults as part of the
evidence base for estimating the effect of increased potassium on blood pressure
and potential adverse effects in children and downgraded it from high to
moderate in quality because of indirectness (that is, use of a proxy population
for the target population).

†Data from adults used as proxy for children.

We considered the entirety of the evidence and the quality of the body of
evidence in adults and children in generating conclusions.

Sensitivity analysis
In the meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in adults, we removed the
one study at high risk of bias.61
Increased potassium intake still reduced systolic (3.50 (1.82 to 5.15) mm Hg)
and diastolic (2.95 (1.06 to 4.84) mm Hg) blood pressure. We removed cohort
studies from the meta-analyses that measured exposure to potassium intake
through one 24 hour dietary recall.70
75 Increased potassium was still
associated with having a protective effect on risk of stroke (risk ratio 0.79,
0.66 to 0.95) and had no association with risk of incident coronary heart
disease (0.89, 0.53 to 1.48). We removed the study that did not have random
treatment allocation from the meta-analyses in children,80 and we saw little effect on the reduction in blood
pressure (0.27 (−0.62 to 1.15 mm Hg).

Discussion
The results from our meta-analyses of 22 randomised controlled trials in adults
confirm that increased potassium intake reduces systolic and diastolic blood
pressure. Our review is the first to document through a systematic search of the
literature and meta-analyses that increased potassium has no adverse effect on blood
lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, or renal function in adults. We
found a beneficial effect of higher potassium intake on risk of incident stroke but
not of total cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease; however, because few
studies have reported these outcomes, detecting an effect is difficult even through
meta-analysis.

Benefits of increased potassium
Our results on blood pressure are consistent with three previous meta-analyses,
and a fourth systematic review without meta-analysis, of trials comparing higher
potassium with lower potassium intake.20
21
22
23 One previous meta-analysis
restricted to studies conducted in people with hypertension reported no effect
of potassium supplementation on blood pressure.24 The discrepancy in results could be due to that review having
included only six studies and 483 participants, whereas our review included 22
studies and 1892 participants, providing much more power to detect an effect.
The meta-analyses of 11 cohort studies in adults suggest an association between
higher potassium intake and reduced risk of stroke. These results are consistent
with the previous meta-analysis of cohort studies, which reported that a 42
mmol/day higher potassium intake was associated with a 21% lower risk of
stroke.19

Our review was also the first in children and found a non-significant reduction
in blood pressure. Importantly, we showed through a systematic search of the
literature the lack of data in children. Only three controlled studies with 156
children met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, so the lack of
significant effect may reflect lack of statistical power. The suggestion of a
beneficial effect in the controlled trials was supported by the one cohort study
in children, which also reported a beneficial effect of higher potassium intake
on blood pressure. Because renal function, and thus the body’s main mechanism
for controlling potassium balance, is fully developed early in childhood,
potassium intake might be expected to have the same relation with blood pressure
and the other health outcomes explored in children as in adults. Therefore,
findings in adults can provide some support for an effect of increased potassium
intake on blood pressure in children. Nevertheless, high quality randomised
controlled trials in children are warranted to explore this relation
further.

The meta analysis of 16 randomised controlled trials in adults with hypertension
and in the two randomised controlled trials conducted in a mixed group of people
with and without hypertension found that increased potassium intake decreased
systolic blood pressure. However, potassium had no detectable effect on blood
pressure in the meta-analysis of three randomised controlled trials conducted
exclusively in people without hypertension. However, the studies in people
without hypertension were of relatively short duration and did not consider the
effect that increased potassium intake may have over time on the prevention of
elevated blood pressure. Given the high prevalence of hypertension in adult
populations,2 and the relatively low
potassium intake globally,9
84
85 populations around the world will
probably benefit from increased potassium intake. Elevated blood pressure is the
leading risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for almost 13% of
deaths.3 The decrease in blood
pressure caused by increased potassium intake can have important public health
benefits at the population level. For example a decrease of 2 mm Hg in diastolic
blood pressure in the population of the United States could prevent an estimated
67 000 coronary heart disease events and 34 000 stroke events every year.86 Researchers estimate that a 5 mm Hg
reduction in systolic blood pressure in the population of the United Kingdom
could reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 50% in that country.87

Through subgroup analysis, we attempted to assess if the type of intervention
(supplements versus dietary changes) affected the relation between increased
potassium intake and the outcomes of interest. Increasing potassium intake
through dietary supplements and through dietary changes both reduced systolic
blood pressure, suggesting that the vehicle of increased potassium intake can be
food and does not have to be a supplement. The results from the cohort studies
support this claim, as all cohort studies considered groups of varying dietary
potassium intake and showed a beneficial effect of higher potassium intake from
food on risk of stroke. Moreover, potassium is found in a wide variety of foods,
so people can achieve a higher potassium intake through increasing consumption
of foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables and pulses (legumes).

Potential adverse effects
We systematically searched for, compiled, and meta-analysed all available data on
the potential adverse effect of increased potassium intake on blood lipid
concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, and renal function and found that
increased potassium, either in supplement or dietary form, had no adverse
effects on these outcomes. Other researchers have shown that in people without
renal impairment caused by medical conditions or drug treatment, increasing
potassium consumption from food is safe.17
48
88
89
90 People with impaired urinary
potassium excretion can be at risk of hyperkalaemia, an unhealthy elevated serum
potassium concentration, from increased potassium consumption.17 The risk is confined to those
patients, most of whom are under medical supervision,17 and they were not included in this review. In people
without renal impairment, the body is able to efficiently adapt and excrete
excess potassium in the urine when consumption exceeds needs.7
90 Intervention trials including
potassium consumption as high as 400 mmol/day from food for several weeks and
115 mmol/day for up to a year reported no adverse effects from increased
potassium intake.48
90 Some isolated cases of acute
toxicity from extremely high potassium intake in supplement form have been
reported,91 but no cases of
toxicity from potassium intake from food have been reported. Because of the
safety of consumption of increased potassium from food, our objectives did not
include testing a potential upper limit of intake. We did, however,
systematically search for and record any adverse effects reported by study
authors. No studies reported increased side effects, minor complaints, or major
adverse effects in the increased potassium groups compared with the control
groups.

Optimum potassium intake
This review is the first to attempt to determine an optimum level of potassium
intake for affecting health outcomes. Moderate and high quality evidence showed
that a higher potassium intake of 90-120 mmol/day reduced blood pressure and was
associated with a lower risk of incident stroke. Intake above 120 mmol/day did
not seem to have any additional benefit. However, the evidence from the
randomised controlled trials and cohort studies in adults was limited in that it
did not identify a precise optimal level of potassium intake for maximum health
benefits. However, if a person consumes 90 mmol/day or more potassium and the
WHO recommended sodium intake of less than 2 g/day,92 his or her intake would have a molar ratio of sodium
to potassium of approximately one to one, a ratio considered beneficial for
health.10
31 A subgroup analysis of the
randomised controlled trials to explore whether different levels of sodium
intake influenced the effect of potassium on blood pressure showed no
statistically significant difference in the effect estimates among subgroups
based on sodium intake. However, the results suggest that potassium may be more
effective in reducing blood pressure at higher levels of sodium consumption,
consistent with previous findings.22
The largest benefit was detected when sodium intake was more than 4 g/day, which
is the intake of most populations globally,93 so increased potassium intake should benefit most people in most
countries. However, we also found a statistically significant decrease in blood
pressure with increased potassium when sodium intake was 2-4 g/day. Therefore,
increased potassium can continue to be beneficial in terms of blood pressure
even as individuals and populations decrease their sodium intake. Studies
examining both nutrients simultaneously support this concept, showing an
increased benefit with simultaneous reduction in sodium and increase in
potassium compared with changes in one nutrient individually.94
95

Limitations of study
Some limitations of this review should be noted. The funnel plots used to assess
small study bias were not clear, and some small study bias may be present.
Baseline hypertension status accounted for most heterogeneity in the analyses,
and the consistency in results after subgrouping by hypertension status suggests
that any such bias did not greatly affect the results or conclusions. This
review did not cover the recommended period of exclusive breast feeding (0-6
months) or the period of complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding
(6-24 months). The review did not include studies in patients with acute disease
conditions such as HIV positive status, heart failure, or renal failure.
Therefore, the results should not be interpreted to include those age groups or
acutely ill patients, especially those with impaired renal function and
defective renal potassium handling. We could not test whether the effect of
increased potassium on health differed by the type of potassium provided in
supplements. In supplementation studies, only one study used potassium citrate,
one used potassium bicarbonate, and one used a combination of the two. All
others used potassium chloride supplements. Therefore, we could not compare
different supplement types. We could not compare differences by sex, because
20/22 randomised controlled trials and 9/12 cohort studies were in mixed
populations of men and women. None the less, the overall beneficial effect of
increased potassium on health supports a beneficial effect in both men and
women. Finally, we did not consider the mechanism by which increased potassium
may affect blood pressure and related non-communicable disease.

Conclusion
This systematic review provides the most complete picture to date of
epidemiological and clinical trial evidence in humans of the effect of potassium
intake on blood pressure and related non-communicable diseases in apparently
healthy adults and children without renal impairment that might compromise
handling of potassium. It combines the data from 22 randomised controlled trials
and 11 cohort studies in adults in meta-analyses and compiles and compares the
data from four controlled trials and cohort studies in children. High quality
evidence (based on GRADE criteria) from studies in adults shows that increased
potassium intake benefits blood pressure without having an adverse effect on
blood lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, or renal function.
Although data from studies conducted in children are limited, the available
evidence suggests that increased potassium intake might reduce blood pressure,
and consuming more potassium through foods high in potassium would probably be
beneficial for most children. Low quality evidence (based on GRADE criteria)
from cohort observational studies in adults shows that increased potassium
intake has an inverse association with risk of incident stroke. Our results also
suggest that the most benefit may occur when people consume at least 90 mmol of
potassium a day.

On the basis of the entirety of this evidence and informed by the expert guidance
of the WHO Nutrition Guidelines Expert Advisory Group, WHO developed its first
guideline on potassium intake,96 which
states that adults and children without compromised renal handling of potassium
should increase their potassium intake from food and that adults should consume
more than 90 mmol potassium/day for beneficial effects on blood pressure and
risk of related cardiovascular diseases.

What is already known on this topic
Lower potassium consumption has been associated with elevated
blood pressure, hypertension, and stroke, and higher consumption
levels could be protective against these conditions

The evidence regarding the potential beneficial effect of
increased potassium intake on blood pressure and cardiovascular
disease is not entirely consistent 

Data regarding potential adverse effects on blood lipid
concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, and renal function
in adults and data in children are limited

What this study adds
This systematic review and meta-analyses provide the most
comprehensive synthesis to date of the large body of evidence
that increasing potassium intake reduces blood pressure in
adults and that an inverse relation exists between potassium
intake and incident stroke

Increased potassium intake has no adverse effect on blood lipid
concentration, catecholamine concentrations, or renal function
in apparently healthy adults without impaired renal handling of
potassium

Increased potassium intake may have a beneficial effect on blood
pressure in children, but more data are needed
