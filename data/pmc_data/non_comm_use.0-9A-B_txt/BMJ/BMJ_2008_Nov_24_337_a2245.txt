Objective To provide an overview of drug use in children in three
                    European countries.

Design Retrospective cohort study, 2000-5.

Setting Primary care research databases in the Netherlands (IPCI),
                    United Kingdom (IMS-DA), and Italy (Pedianet).

Participants 675 868 children aged up to 14 (Italy) or 18 (UK and
                    Netherlands).

Main outcome measure Prevalence of use per year calculated by drug
                    class (anatomical and therapeutic). Prevalence of “recurrent/chronic” use (three
                    or more prescriptions a year) and “non-recurrent” or “acute” use (less than
                    three prescriptions a year) within each therapeutic class. Descriptions of the
                    top five most commonly used drugs evaluated for off label status within each
                    anatomical class.

Results Three levels of drug use could be distinguished in the study
                    population: high (>10/100 children per year), moderate (1-10/100 children
                    per year), and low (<1/100 children per year). For all age categories,
                    anti-infective, dermatological, and respiratory drugs were in the high use
                    group, whereas cardiovascular and antineoplastic drugs were always in the low
                    use group. Emollients, topical steroids, and asthma drugs had the highest
                    prevalence of recurrent use, but relative use of low prevalence drugs was more
                    often recurrent than acute. In the top five highest prevalence drugs topical
                    inhaled and systemic steroids, oral contraceptives, and topical or systemic
                    antifungal drugs were most commonly used off label.

Conclusion This overview of outpatient paediatric prescription
                    patterns in a large European population could provide information to prioritise
                    paediatric therapeutic research needs.
==== Body
Introduction
Recent years have seen growing concerns about the incompleteness of the evidence
                relating to the efficacy and safety of drugs used in children. Almost all of the
                drugs prescribed to children are the same as those originally developed for adults.
                They are often prescribed on an unlicensed or “off label” basis (percentages ranging
                from 11-80%1) simply by extrapolating data
                for adults, without conducting any paediatric clinical, kinetic, dose finding, or
                formulation studies in children. Diseases in children, however, might be different
                from their adult equivalents, and the processes underlying growth and development
                might lead to a different effect or an adverse drug reaction unseen in adults
                (Reye’s syndrome is an outstanding example).

To provide legitimate and appropriate treatment for children’s diseases, new
                legislation was approved in the United States in 2003 and the European Union in
                    2007.2 Both the Food and Drug
                Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency for the Evaluation of
                Medicinal Products (EMEA) now offer extensions of drug licences to companies who
                provide evidence concerning the efficacy and safety in children of new drugs or off
                label drugs.3
                4
                5
                6 The World Health Organization underlines
                the need for these actions and in December 2007 launched a global campaign to “make
                medicines child size” to address the need for improved availability and access to
                safe child specific medicines for all children.7

We investigated the current use of paediatric drugs in children in three European
                countries, using population based data on primary care prescriptions.

Methods
Setting
The primary care of children is entrusted to general practitioners in the UK and
                    the Netherlands and to paediatricians in Italy.8
                    9 Access to health care is free in Italy
                    and the UK and fully covered by healthcare insurance in the Netherlands. In
                    these countries, primary care physicians are responsible for children’s health
                    care, which means that all clinical information concerning the patients
                    (including summaries of specialist and hospital care) is kept in their medical
                    records. As all children need to be registered with a general practitioner in
                    the Netherlands and UK and with a family paediatrician in Italy, the databases
                    are population based.9

Data collection
We used the same protocol to study prescription patterns in the three countries,
                    making use of the Pedianet database (paediatric electronic medical records from
                    150 paediatricians since 2000) in Italy,10 the integrated primary care information (IPCI) database (comprising
                    adult and paediatric electronic medical records from more than 400 doctors since
                    1996) in the Netherlands,8
                    11
                    12 and the IMS disease analyser
                    database (IMS-DA: electronic medical records on adults and children from 670
                    doctors) in the UK.13 All of these
                    databases include the complete automated medical records of primary care
                    physicians and have been used and proved valid for pharmacoepidemiological
                        research.9 The age and sex
                    distribution in the various databases is representative for the country of
                    origin.

Study population and drug prescriptions
The dynamic study population in each country consisted of all children aged 0-18
                    years (0-14 years in Italy) who had a database history of at least six months or
                    who were born during the study period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2005). We
                    calculated the person time of follow-up for each child, stratified by calendar
                    year and age group. Age was assessed on 1 January of each year and grouped
                    according to the guidelines of the International Conference of Harmonization
                    (ICH) as <2, 2-11, and 12-18.14
                    We could not further stratify the youngest age category into newborns (<1
                    month) and infants (1-24 months) as exact dates of birth were not available
                    because of privacy regulations. Each child was followed from the start of the
                    study period or the date of registration with the primary practice (whichever
                    was the latest) until the cancellation of registration with the practice or the
                    end of the study period. We used the person time accumulated in each calendar
                    year as the denominator to calculate prevalence rates. Over the study period
                    children could contribute to more than one age category.

All prescribed drugs in children during follow-up were retrieved from the
                    prescription data in the database. The drug prescriptions were grouped on the
                    basis of the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system,
                    which made comparison between countries possible.

Statistical analysis
We estimated user prevalence rates (per 1000 person years) by counting the number
                    of children using a specific drug in a specific calendar year. The prevalence
                    rates were calculated by age and country to account for differences in
                    distributions between populations and to allow for direct comparisons within
                    groups. User prevalence rates should be interpreted as the number of children
                    per 1000 who use a specific class of drug in one year. We could not calculate
                    prevalence of drug use for children aged 15-18 in Italy because all of children
                    were censored at the age of 15. We used person years rather than individuals as
                    the denominator because of the dynamic nature of age and the population.

For each anatomical class of drug we assessed the age and country specific user
                    prevalence rates for all individual drugs in 2005. We evaluated the five drugs
                    with the highest prevalence per anatomical class in each country for off label
                    status considering age only. A drug was considered to be off label for age if
                    the child’s age at the time of use was below the lowest approved age mentioned
                    in the summary of product characteristics of that drug in each country.15 Within each therapeutic drug level, we
                    separately estimated the prevalence of children presenting “recurrent/chronic”
                    (three or more prescriptions a year) versus “non-recurrent” or “acute” drug use
                    (less than three prescriptions a year), and the ratio between them to identify
                    the treatments more commonly used for chronic than acute paediatric diseases. We
                    used χ2 test to compare user prevalence rates.

Results
Study population
Our population of 675 868 children generated 2 334 673 person years of follow-up
                    (table 1); the mean individual follow-up was
                    3.5 years. Most of the children (66%) came from the IMS database in the UK, 19%
                    from Italy, and 15% from the Netherlands. The databases recorded more than five
                    million paediatric prescriptions. In all three countries the prescription rate
                    was highest for the children aged under 2 and, in each age group, was
                    significantly higher in the UK and Italy than in the Netherlands
                    (P<0.001) (table 1).

*Number of children in various age groups does not add up to total as one

Drug use by anatomical class
The highest prevalence rates among the children aged under 2 were for
                    anti-infective drugs, respiratory drugs, and dermatological drugs, which were
                    used by 48%, 30%, and 30% of the children, respectively (fig 1). The other common prescriptions were for
                    gastrointestinal drugs (user prevalence of 20%), drugs for the nervous system
                    (14%) and drugs for sensory organs (19%). Blood and blood forming organs,
                    hormonal, and musculoskeletal system drugs were used in 1-10% of the children,
                    and cardiovascular, genitourinary, antineoplastic, and antiparasitic drugs by
                    less than 1%.

Fig 1 One year prevalence of drug prescriptions by age
                            (<2, 2-11, 12-18 years), and anatomical class

Among the children aged 2-11, the prevalence of use of anti-infective,
                    respiratory, and dermatological drugs decreased to 30%, 21%, and 17%,
                    respectively. The prevalence was 1-10% for gastrointestinal, hormonal,
                    musculoskeletal system, nervous system, antiparasitic, and sensory organ drugs;
                    and less than 1% for blood and blood forming organs, cardiovascular,
                    genitourinary, and antineoplastic drugs.

In adolescents (12-18 years), anti-infective, respiratory, and dermatological
                    drugs were used by more than 10% per year. Most of the other drug classes were
                    used by 1-10%, but the prevalence of use of cardiovascular and antineoplastic
                    drugs was less than 1%.

Regarding sex differences, in the youngest age groups, most of the drugs were
                    equally prescribed to both sexes or more commonly prescribed to boys than girls
                    (rate ratio <1), particularly anti-infective and respiratory drugs. This
                    pattern reversed in adolescence, when user prevalence for almost all drug
                    classes (except non-sex hormones) was higher among girls than boys. This sex
                    pattern, which was consistent across countries, was most pronounced for
                    genitourinary drugs, with a user prevalence more than 60 times higher in girls
                    because they include oral contraceptives, which accounted for 95% of the use of
                    genitourinary drugs in girls. The use of drugs for blood and blood forming
                    organs (mainly iron preparations) was also markedly higher among adolescent
                    girls.

The age trend of prevalence of use was consistent across countries, although
                    there were some variations in the age specific rates (fig 2). In particular, the UK showed the highest prevalence of
                    alimentary drug use in children aged under 2, and the prevalence of
                    prescriptions of dermatological drugs was threefold to fourfold higher in the UK
                    and the Netherlands than in Italy (both P<0.001). The prevalence of
                    genitourinary drug use (almost all oral contraceptives) was high in adolescent
                    girls in the Netherlands (P<0.001). In Italy, the use of hormones (almost
                    all systemic corticosteroids) was 10-fold higher in children aged <2
                    (P<0.001) and fivefold higher in those aged 2-11 (P<0.001);
                    respiratory drug use was also greater in Italy than in the other two countries
                    (P<0.001). The prevalence of the use of anti-infective drugs and drugs
                    for musculoskeletal disorders was much lower in the Netherlands; the prevalence
                    of prescriptions for drugs for the nervous system (including paracetamol, which
                    can be prescribed in UK) was much higher in the UK; and the use of drugs for the

                            age (<2, 2-11, 12-18), country, and anatomical class for most
                            prevalently used drug classes (data for Italy excluded age category
                            12-18)

Prevalence of drug use in therapeutic class
Within the most commonly used anatomical drug classes, antibacterials accounted
                    for most of the anti-infective drug use; and the therapeutic classes
                    antiasthmatics, other respiratory products, and nasal preparations were the most
                    commonly used drugs in the respiratory group (table 2). The therapeutic classes with the highest prevalence of use
                    among the dermatological drugs were topical corticosteroids and emollients and
                    barrier creams. Many therapeutic classes in the group of alimentary drugs
                    (laxatives, antidiarrhoeal drugs, drugs for acid disorders) had a considerable
                    prevalence of use. The most commonly prescribed drugs in the other classes were
                    antianemia medications, cardiac drugs (mainly digoxin), sex hormones, oral
                    corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and
                    ophthalmological drugs.

*Excluding therapeutic levels with prevalence of both acute and recurrent
                            use <0.1/1000 person years.

Ranking of user prevalence rates specific for age over the entire range of drugs
                    showed that antibacterials are the most commonly prescribed drugs in all age
                    groups (table 3) and are prescribed to at
                    least twice as many children as the second most commonly used drug in each age
                    category. The second most commonly used drug changed by age from
                    ophthalmological drugs (<2 years) to drugs for obstructive airway disease
                    (2-11) to sex hormones (12-18).

ATC=WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.

When we ranked the therapeutic classes within each anatomical class on the basis
                    of the ratio between recurrent (chronic) and non-recurrent (acute), we observed
                    a different pattern (table 2). The drugs with
                    a ratio of >1 (indicating mostly chronic/recurrent use) were often those
                    with a low prevalence of use (except for sex hormones): antidiabetics,
                    digestives, bile and liver therapy, antithrombotic agents, agents acting on the
                    renin-angiotensin system, lipid lowering drugs, sex hormones, thyroid
                    therapeutic agents, immunosuppressive agents, muscle relaxants, antiepileptics,
                    and psychoanaleptics (table 2). In absolute
                    terms, emollients, topical corticosteroids, sex hormones, anti-infectives, and
                    drugs for obstructive airway disease showed the highest prevalence of recurrent
                    use.

Most commonly used drugs in each anatomical class
In the most commonly used anatomical classes (dermatology, anti-infectives, and
                    respiratory system), the most common individual dermatological drugs were
                    fusidic acid (except for Italy), topical steroids, and topical
                    imidazole/triazole derivatives (tables 4, 5, and 6)
                    
                    . The topical triazoles/imidazoles were off
                    label in most countries for at least one or more age categories. In the
                    anti-infectives group (J), penicillin derivatives (amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav,
                    and phenoxymethylpenicillin) followed by macrolides (erythromycin,
                    clarithromycin) were the most common, cefalexin (UK, <2 year) was the
                    only off label drug. Oral aciclovir was one of the top five anti-infective drugs
                    in Italy. Among the respiratory drugs, salbutamol and inhaled steroids
                    (beclometasone, fluticasone, flunisolide), antihistamines (cetirizine,
                    loratidine, clorpheniramine), and xylometazoline were most commonly prescribed.
                    Beclometasone, xylometazoline, and cetirizine were off label in the youngest
                    children (<2 years) in the UK and the Netherlands.

In the moderately used drugs (gastrointestinal, genitourinary, nervous system,
                    and sensory system drugs), the most commonly prescribed alimentary tract drugs
                    (A) were laxatives (lactulose), miconazole, domperidone, and mebeverine. Only
                    ranitidine and laurilsulfate were off label in children <2 years. For the
                    genitourinary drugs, the top five in the Netherlands and UK were oral
                    contraceptives and topical antifungals (miconazole), whereas in Italy (up to age
                    12) oestrogens, drugs to treat incontinence, and antiseptics were the most
                    commonly prescribed. The percentage of off label use of oral contraceptives and
                    antifungals was high in the Netherlands and the UK. Among drugs for the nervous
                    system, paracetamol is clearly the most used (but probably underestimated
                    because of high over the counter use); methylphenidate (Netherlands and UK),
                    lidocaine (Netherlands), pizotifen (UK), fluoxetine (UK) diazepam, niaprazine
                    (Italy), and valproic acid (Italy) were also in the top five of at least one
                    country. None of them was used off label, except diazepam for children under 12
                    in the Netherlands. In the group of sensory organ drugs many different drugs
                    were used in the various countries, the most commonly prescribed drugs in the
                    Netherlands (fusidic acid, levocabastine) and the UK (chloramphenicol) were off
                    label.

The low prevalence drugs comprised many classes (groups blood, cardiovascular,
                    hormonal, antineoplastic, musculoskeletal, antiparastic). In the blood forming
                    organs group (B), phytomenadione, iron, tranexamic acid, platelet inhibitors,
                    and vitamin K antagonists were most commonly prescribed. Salicylic acid
                    derivatives were off label. In the cardiovascular drug group topical steroids
                    (antihaemorrhoid creams), topical anaesthetics (lidocaine, oxetacaine), β
                    blockers (propranolol, atenolol), furosemide, disopyramide, adrenaline
                    (epinephrine), and enalapril were most common. Furosemide, β blockers,
                    adrenaline, and topical (antihaemorrhoidal) steroids were off label in at least
                    one country. For the non-sex hormones, desmopressin, oral steroids
                    (dexamethasone, prednisolone and prednisone), levothyroxine and glucagons) were
                    the most commonly prescribed drugs. Only the oral steroids were off label
                    (Netherlands and UK only). The most commonly prescribed antineoplastic and
                    immunomodulating drugs differed substantially between countries but were almost
                    always off label. In the musculoskeletal drug group non-steroidal
                    anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly prescribed, with important
                    sequence differences between countries but little off label use except in Italy,
                    where the number one and two drugs (ibuprofen and morniflumate) were off label.
                    In all countries the number one antiprotozoal drug was mebendazole, with little
                    off label drug use.

Discussion
We have provided a unique overview of primary care prescription patterns in a large
                multinational European paediatric population. The data could be used to improve the
                prioritisation of research into long term safety of paediatric drugs, as well as
                efficacy and effectiveness studies in paediatric medicine. Off label use in some of
                the most commonly and recurrently used drugs is high (such as oral contraceptives)
                and these should be considered for prioritisation.

Prioritisation of research on drug safety in paediatrics
We recommend two important assessments in prioritising research needs in
                    medicines for children: public health assessment,16 comprising the severity and prevalence of disease and
                    the availability of treatment alternatives; and assessment of use. This may
                    comprise the frequency or volume of use and the licensing/labelling status of
                    medicines for children. The use of off label and unlicensed medicines implies
                    that there are no proper labelling and dosing recommendations, which can
                    potentially be harmful to children.17
                    18
                    19
                    20 Therefore off label and unlicensed
                    medicines should be a higher priority for research than licensed/on label
                    medications, especially if no data on safety and efficacy in children are
                    available. We focused on assessing the volume and labelling status to provide
                    knowledge to experts and facilitate research prioritisation that includes both
                    the public health as well as the assessment of use.

Our data on use support the conclusions of the recently published EMEA
                    consensus/expert derived list of research priorities concerning off patent
                    medicinal products,16 which emphasised
                    the need for paediatric studies of the safety of topical, systemic, and inhaled
                    steroids. Steroids are associated with impaired growth,21 abnormalities in glucose metabolism,22 and adrenal suppression.23
                    24 Of these, growth retardation is the
                    most common and is of particular concern in children. The extent of growth
                    suppression varies with the method of administration (such as inhaled or oral)
                    and the duration of treatment, as well as with the type and dose of
                    glucocorticoid used.21
                    25 EMEA also lists topical and systemic
                    antifungals (imidazoles/triazoles), acid reducing drugs, and antineoplastic
                    drugs as research priorities. These drugs are often or recurrently used and are
                    mostly off label. Many other drugs listed did not appear as commonly used drugs
                    in our study and, on the basis of frequency of use in primary care alone, would
                    not be considered as priorities but apparently were considered priorities for
                    other reasons. On the other hand, sex hormones are not listed on the priority
                    list, whereas they are commonly and recurrently prescribed, mostly off label.
                    Few long term safety studies on the use of sex hormones in adolescents are
                    available and to our knowledge there are no randomised controlled trials on
                    their safety and efficacy in this age group. The use of oral contraceptives in
                    adolescents has been associated with an increased risk of lower bone mineral
                    density, higher serum cholesterol concentrations, triglyceridaemia,26
                    27
                    28 cardiovascular events (such as
                    myocardial infarction and stroke), and venous thromboembolism.29
                    30
                    31
                    32
                    33 As the use of sex hormones in young
                    adolescents is relatively high, leading to a long duration of use, further
                    studies on the efficacy and long term safety effects of these drugs in young
                    women are warranted.

Although patterns of drug use and labelling status can inform decisions on
                    prioritisation of research, these data inform also us about suboptimal use and
                    might even uncover undesirable prescribing practices. For example, fusidic acid
                    and chloramphenicol are often used and often off label (tables 4-6). In the
                    Netherlands, fusidic acid is prescribed for the treatment of conjunctivitis,
                    similar to chloramphenicol in the UK. The beneficial effect of antibiotics in
                    the treatment of this condition, however, has not been proved.34
                    35 Indeed acute bacterial
                    conjunctivitis is often a self limiting condition, and topical antibiotic use
                    offers only marginal benefit in improving clinical outcomes; hence the emphasis
                    should be on educating clinicians not to prescribe such treatment rather than a
                    call for more research.36
                    37 Another example underlining the need
                    for education rather than research is the cough and cold medications. These
                    drugs are not only available over the counter but are also often prescribed,
                    which should be strongly discouraged because of reports of death and lack of
                        efficacy.38

Patterns of drug use
We found that the prevalence of the most commonly prescribed drugs in primary
                    care is highest in children aged under 2, that the most commonly used drugs
                    (anti-infectives, dermatologicals, and respiratory drugs) are the same in all
                    three age categories, and that almost all other drugs are used by less than 10%
                    of children a year. In general, we can categorise three groups of drug use:
                    drugs used by more than 10% of children a year, those used by 1-10%, and those
                    used by less than 1%. The use of the high prevalence drug classes decreases with
                    age but remains high, whereas the use of the lowest prevalence drug groups
                    increases to a moderate prevalence rate in adolescence, except in the case of
                    cardiovascular and antineoplastic agents. Only a few therapeutic drug classes
                    accounted for most use in a specific anatomical class: antibacterials, topical
                    corticosteroids, antiasthma and antianaemia medications, cardiac drugs, sex
                    hormones, oral corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
                    analgesics, and ophthalmological drugs. Relatively speaking, the high prevalence
                    drugs were more often used for acute use. Only 12 drug classes (antidiabetics,
                    digestives, bile and liver therapy, antithrombotic agents, drugs affecting the
                    renin-angiotensin system, lipid lowering drugs, sex hormones, thyroid
                    therapeutic agents, immunosuppressive agents, muscle relaxants, antiepileptics,
                    and psychoanaleptics) were prescribed more often for recurrent than acute use.

We observed an age related sex reversal: prevalence rates for drug use were
                    consistently higher in adolescents girls than in adolescent boys (except in the
                    case of non-sex hormones), whereas the opposite was true in the younger age
                    categories. This agrees with findings from previous Dutch and Danish
                        studies.39
                    40

Interestingly, the percentage of off label use varied highly between countries,
                    and similar drugs differed in off label status between countries. This confirms
                    that the differences in the paediatric status of the drugs, instead of the
                    different prescription habits or medical cultures as postulated by many authors,
                    represent the real reason for the variability reported by years and from many
                    European studies and surveys on the off label use in children.41

Previous studies
Our study was population based, had a large sample size, and covered different
                    European countries. Previous European studies have been country or region
                    specific and have concentrated on specific conditions, except for studies from
                    Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark in the late 1990s and a recent Italian
                    study covering data from 2000-6.40
                    42
                    43
                    44 These studies took all types of
                    drugs into account but the methods to calculate prevalence and ranking (on the
                    basis of number of dispensed boxes or user prevalence) and age ranges varied
                    largely, which complicates direct comparisons. The overall results—highest drug
                    use in lowest age category, ranking of the most commonly used drugs
                    (anti-infectives, respiratory, and dermatological drugs), and sex pattern (more
                    prescriptions for girls than boys after the age of 10)—are consistent with our
                        findings.39
                    40
                    45

Potential of multi-country database studies
We have shown the potential of studying the primary care prescribing of a wide
                    range of drugs using multiple databases. As all databases include outcome data,
                    such as morbidity and mortality, they can also be used for studies of paediatric
                    drug safety. The country specific estimates provide insights into prescription
                    differences and allow a search for high prevalence countries regarding drug
                    prescribing.

Limitations
We captured only outpatient, primary care drug prescriptions and not use of over
                    the counter drugs (which resulted in a substantial underestimation of the use of
                    paracetamol and phytomenadione, and potentially other drugs such as cough and
                    cold medications). In the Netherlands, the UK, and Italy, most health problems
                    are dealt with in primary care,8 and as
                    drug prescriptions by a specialist for a chronic disease are often continued by
                    general practitioners or paediatricians, most of them are picked up. Drugs given
                    in hospital and the monitoring of chemotherapeutic and biological drugs are
                    unlikely to be fully captured by our databases. Despite differences in the
                    absolute prevalence rates of drug prescribing and the types of drugs prescribed,
                    age and sex patterns were consistent in the three countries. As the UK accounted
                    for 60% of the study population, however, the pooled results are inevitably
                    dominated by UK prescription patterns so we conducted stratified analyses as
                    much as possible. Because of the nature of the databases, we studied drug
                    prescriptions rather than drug intake, and so the prevalence of actual drug
                    exposure might be lower than estimated here.

What is already known on this topic
Most previous research on drug use in children has focused on
                                    specific high use areas such as antibiotics and respiratory and
                                    neuropsychiatric drugs, therefore most of these drugs have a
                                    paediatric licensing status

Paediatric expert groups have been established by the European
                                    Medicines Evaluation Board (EMEA) to identify those drugs that
                                    are important for the paediatric community and that require
                                    additional efficacy and safety data

What this study adds
Data on frequency of prescriptions and off label status of drugs
                                    could provide objective evidence for the prioritisation of
                                    research in paediatric drugs

Information on the safety and efficacy of some of the most
                                    commonly used drugs in children (such as oral contraceptives,
                                    steroids, and triazoles/imidazoles) is lacking, and not all such
                                    drugs are on the list of research needs
