During the production of figs 3 and 7 in this Research article by Patel and colleagues (BMJ 2014;349:g4561, doi:10.1136/bmj.g4561), the data values for “Boldt, Muller et al 1996” and for “Boldt, Müller et al 1996” were transposed, although the graph plots were correct. The error was reproduced in the pico summary published in the print issue of 26 July, as this contains an adapted version of fig 3. The correct figures are supplied below.

Fig 3 Relative risk of all-cause mortality in patients exposed to human albumin solutions compared with exposure to control fluids in the 16 randomised clinical trials included in analysis. Studies are ordered chronologically within subgroups

Fig 7 Relative risk of all-cause mortality in patients exposed to human albumin solutions compared with exposure to colloid fluids in 11 trials. Studies are ordered chronologically within subgroups
