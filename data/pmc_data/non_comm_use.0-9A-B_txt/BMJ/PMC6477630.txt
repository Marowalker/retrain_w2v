==== Body
In figure 2 of this research paper by Song and colleagues (BMJ 2019;365:l1255, doi:10.1136/bmj.l1255, published 10 April 2019), “Fatal cardiovascular events” was erroneously given as “Fatal cerebrovascular events.” Additionally, in the third paragraph of the results section, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease after one year or longer of follow-up when history of other psychiatric disorders and severe somatic diseases was added to the Cox model was given as 1.28 but should have been 1.29. These errors have been corrected.
