In this paper by Alastair D Hay and colleagues (BMJ 2008;337:a1302, doi:10.1136/bmj.a1302) a misunderstanding during editing of the first footnote to table 2 led to errors. In the final sentence of this footnote, the two sets of values (48, 65, and 71; and 65, 73, and 84) are percentages (not minutes) of time without fever over four hours and 24 hours after the first dose of study drugs respectively. The correct times are in the table.
