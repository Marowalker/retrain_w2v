In this Research paper by Taylor and colleagues (BMJ 2014;348:g1888, doi:10.1136/bmj.g1888), the authors have alerted us to an error. In the redrawing of figure 7 (standardised mean differences (SMD) for agomelatine v antidepressant in studies on antidepressant efficacy of agomelatine), some of the study names are incorrect. Under the heading “unpublished studies,” the studies shown as CL3-026, CL3-069, and CL3-070 should have been CL3-048, CL3-052, and CL3-063, respectively.
