Abstract
Bacterial meningitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis and continues to pose a major public health threat. Morbidity and mortality of meningitis are driven by an uncontrolled host inflammatory response. This comprehensive update evaluates the role of the complement system in upregulating and maintaining the inflammatory response in bacterial meningitis. Genetic variation studies, complement level measurements in blood and CSF, and experimental work have together led to the identification of anaphylatoxin C5a as a promising treatment target in bacterial meningitis. In animals and patients with pneumococcal meningitis, the accumulation of neutrophils in the CSF was mainly driven by C5-derived chemotactic activity and correlated positively with disease severity and outcome. In murine pneumococcal meningitis, adjunctive treatment with C5 antibodies prevented brain damage and death. Several recently developed therapeutics target C5 conversion, C5a, or its receptor C5aR. Caution is warranted because treatment with C5 antibodies such as eculizumab also inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex, which may result in decreased meningococcal killing and increased meningococcal disease susceptibility. The use of C5a or C5aR antagonists to specifically target the harmful anaphylatoxins-induced effects, therefore, are most promising and present opportunities for a phase 2 clinical trial.

Introduction
Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection of the CNS. Bacteria enter the CSF in the subarachnoid space either by crossing the blood–CNS barrier (either the blood–brain barrier through the brain parenchymal microvasculature or the blood–CSF barrier through the choroid plexus or the pial or arachnoidal microvasculature) or from a contiguous site of infection (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2011; Coureuil et al., 2017). Bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the resulting damage-associated molecular patterns in the CSF provoke a massive and often uncontrolled inflammatory response leading to high rates of complications, morbidity, and mortality in patients (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2011; van de Beek et al., 2016a).

Most common pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial meningitis are currently Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, accounting for 70%, 10%, and 5% of cases, respectively (van de Beek et al., 2004b; Bijlsma et al., 2016). Pneumococcal meningitis is also one of the most common forms, after listerial meningitis, the form with the highest mortality rate (12–18%) (van de Beek et al., 2006; Bijlsma et al., 2016; Polkowska et al., 2017). The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has resulted in a decline in incidence as reported by cohorts from several geographical areas (Hsu et al., 2009; Alari et al., 2016; Bijlsma et al., 2016; Ruiz-Contreras et al., 2017). Nevertheless, reported effectiveness of the 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines differed per region, and subsequent increase of invasive pneumococcal disease due to non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes has been reported (Weinberger et al., 2011; Gladstone et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015; Brouwer and van de Beek, 2018; Vadlamudi et al., 2019). It is therefore likely that pneumococcal meningitis will remain a major health challenge (Koelman et al., 2019).

Over the past 15 years, the implementation of anti-inflammatory treatment with adjunctive dexamethasone therapy to dampen the inflammatory response has resulted in an absolute decrease of mortality by 10% (de Gans et al., 2002; van de Beek et al., 2004a; Brouwer et al., 2010). Nevertheless, mortality and morbidity are still too high with death occurring in ∼20% of patients, inability to live an independent life in 20%, and (neuro)psychological sequelae in 50% (Schmidt et al., 2006; Hoogman et al., 2007; Bijlsma et al., 2016; Lucas et al., 2016). Therefore, new adjunctive therapies are needed (Davis and Greenlee, 2003; van de Beek, 2012). Further, dampening the host inflammatory response with such new adjunctive treatments is the promising approach in bacterial meningitis (van de Beek et al., 2012).

The complement system plays a key role in the innate immune system, through facilitating the clearing of pathogens and damaged cells by immune cells, direct bacterial killing by the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC), but also by promoting the inflammatory response through the production of anaphylatoxins (Murphy and Weaver, 2017). Diseases directly linked with the complement system include paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), age-related macular degeneration, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS), hereditary angioedema, and C3-glomerulopathies (Morgan and Harris, 2015). The complement system also appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases, resulting in a strong increase in pathophysiological studies and clinical trials investigating complement system intervention over the past 15 years (Morgan, 2015). Because of the multiplicity of complement system activation routes and the various components, proteases, convertases, anaphylactic peptides and receptors involved, the complement system includes numerous points to intervene (Fig. 1) (Morgan and Harris, 2015). Bacterial meningitis is one of the diseases in which the complement anaphylatoxin-induced cellular immune response seems to have profound detrimental effects on the brain and blood compartment.


Figure 1 
Complement system and therapeutic targets in bacterial meningitis. The complement system is activated via multiple pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. The classical pathway starts with binding of C1q to immune complexes such as non-specific IgM that binds to the pneumococcal C polysaccharide. The lectin pathway is activated through direct binding of collectins, such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins, to sugars on the bacterial surface. This results in the binding with the corresponding serine proteases [C1r and C1s, and MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP), respectively], to form complexes that facilitate cleavage of C2 and C4. This forms C3-convertase (C4bC2b), which catalyses the conversion of C3 to C3a and C3b. The alternative pathway is activated when C3b, either produced due to spontaneous hydrolysis or initiating pathway activation, binds to a microbe. This allows C3b to bind with factor B. Subsequently, factor B is cleaved into Ba and Bb by factor D. Bb remains bound to C3 and forms a complex (C3bBb). The serum protein properdin binds this complex to make it more stable. C3bBb(P) acts as another C3-convertase further promoting C3 conversion, thus amplifying complement system activation. There are several natural inhibitors of the alternative pathway including complement receptor 1, factor H and complement protease complement factor I. C3b is an opsonin that facilitates phagocytosis. When C3b binds with the C4b2b complex or to a C3bBb complex, it forms C5 convertase (C4b2b3b and C3bBb3b respectively). Because of the catalysing activity of C5 convertase, C5 is cleaved to C5a and C5b. C5b is the first complement component of the MAC complex. Simplified, C5b consecutively binds C6, C7, C8, which induced the binding and subsequent polymerization of 10 to 16 C9 molecules, creating the pore-forming structure known as the MAC. The pores formed by the MAC complex enable molecules to diffuse freely in and out of the cell. If enough pores form, the cell will no longer be viable. C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins that are produced during complement system activation both in order of production (from early to late) as in order of potency (from weak to active). Anaphylatoxins upregulate the inflammatory response by binding to its specific receptor C5aR, which are mainly expressed by immune cells, and result in increased blood–CSF barrier permeability and the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the CSF. Various complement therapeutics are available targeting C1s [TNNNT009 (True North), C1q (ANX005 (Annexon)], MASP-2 and 3 [OMS-721 and OMS906, respectively (Omeros)], C2 [PRO-02 (Prothix/Broteio)], C3b [H17 (Elusys); S77 (Genentech), factor B (bikaciomab (Novelmed)], factor D [lampalizumab (Genentech); ACH-4471 (Achillion)], properdin [CLG561 (Novartis)], C3 [compstatin family: AMY-101 (Amyndas), APL-1 and APL-2 (Apellis)], C5 [soliris/eculizumab (Alexion); ALXN1210 (Alexion); tesidolumab/LFG316 (Novartins/Morphosys); SKY59/ RO7112689 (Chugai and Roche); REGN3918 (Regeneron); ABP 959 (Amgen); Coversin (Akari); Zilucoplan/RA101495 (Ra Pharma); Zimura (Ophtotech); ALN-CC5 (Alnylam)], C5a [IFX-1 (InflaRx); ALXN1007 (Alexion)], and C5aR [Avacopan/CCX168 (Chemocentryx); IPH5401 (Innate Pharma)].

In this comprehensive update, we will systematically evaluate evidence gained from genetic variation studies, complement level measurements in blood and CSF, and experimental work that have together identified the complement system as a promising treatment target in bacterial meningitis. We will conclude with an up-to-date summary of the therapeutic options available to move complement system intervention forward to clinical translation in bacterial meningitis.

Complement variation studies
The complement system is often regarded as a double-edged sword (Morgan, 2015). Deficiencies in the complement system are well-known to increase the risk of bacterial infections (Brouwer et al., 2009). Terminal pathway deficiencies that inhibit MAC formation, for instance, are associated with increased susceptibility to Gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria species. The cell wall of these bacteria is thin in comparison to Gram-positive bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, making it vulnerable for the MAC (Skarnes and Watson, 1957). Conversely, an overactive complement system, although limiting susceptibility, could result in an uncontrolled inflammatory response in patients once infected, and lead to an unfavourable outcome. It was noted more than 30 years ago that patients with invasive meningococcal disease who had a late complement deficiency had a lower mortality rate (Ross and Densen, 1984). Several studies have investigated this double-edged sword hypothesis for other complement gene variations by investigating its associations with disease course and outcome of invasive pneumococcal and meningococcal disease (Table 1) (Hibberd et al., 1999; Kronborg and Garred, 2002; Perez-Castellano et al., 2006; Faber et al., 2007; Endeman et al., 2008; Garcia-Laorden et al., 2008, 2013; Woehrl et al., 2011; Garnacho-Montero et al., 2012; Adriani et al., 2013; Brouwer et al., 2013; Lundbo et al., 2014; Bradley et al., 2015; Mills et al., 2015; Kasanmoentalib et al., 2017). Overall, patients with genetic variations associated with complement deficiencies seemed to have higher susceptibility, but inversely improved rate of favourable outcome. Results of the different reports are, however, not always similar and may differ per pathogen (Hibberd et al., 1999; Faber et al., 2007; Garnacho-Montero et al., 2012; Brouwer et al., 2013), homozygous and heterozygous deficiencies (Hellemann et al., 2007), and clinical situation (Garred et al., 2003; Fidler et al., 2004). Pathogens differ in their way of complement activation. For S. pneumoniae, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) does not function as complement activator (Ali et al., 2012). A factor compromising the interpretation of genetic variations with outcome is that a linkage disequilibrium may exist (Fijen et al., 1999; Spath et al., 1999). The most striking genetic association identified was that of a genetic variation in the C5 encoding region (rs17611), which was significantly associated with unfavourable outcome of pneumococcal meningitis, even when corrected for multiple testing, or in a multivariate regression model corrected for risk factors for poor outcome (Woehrl et al., 2011).

Complement activation in bacterial meningitis
Pathogens that cross the blood–CNS barrier are able to multiply freely in the CSF as the effectiveness of the host defence is limited in the subarachnoid space (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2011). In non-infected healthy individuals, complement levels in the CSF are 100 to a 1000-fold lower compared to serum concentrations; too low for any significant antibacterial activity (van de Beek et al., 2016a). Historically, the CNS was considered immunologically privileged. Before the invention of antibiotics when bacterial meningitis was almost universally fatal, patients were even occasionally (and sometimes successfully) treated with intrathecally administered serum or complement to make-up for the lack of CSF bactericidal activity (M’Kenzie and Martin, 1908; Finland et al., 1938; Coleman, 1940; Domingo et al., 2019). The adjuvant use of intrathecal serum or complement in patients treated with antibacterial sulphonamides in the late 1930 to 1940s did, not, however, seem to beneficially affect the disease course and may have led to increased mortality in meningococcal meningitis patients [17% (374/2139) versus 9% (482/5221)] (Coleman, 1940; Domingo et al., 2019). Studies in the 1910–1940s that identified complement activity in the CSF of a small proportion of cases with acute inflammatory conditions thought it was the sole result of extravasation of complement components from the blood related to increased blood–CSF barrier permeability (Kolmer et al., 1918; Fothergill, 1935). However, since the 1990s, it has been known that several cells in the CNS have an immune-regulatory function, and that astrocytes, but also microglia, ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes and neurons all express complement proteins resulting in a complete and functional complement system (Morgan and Gasque, 1996; Stahel et al., 1997).

The host immune response in the CSF is activated through surface-bound or intracellular pattern recognition receptors including different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2011), and pattern-recognition molecules including collectins and complement component C1q, especially when pathogens die because of stress conditions (e.g. nutrient shortage, antibiotic administration) (Hajishengallis and Lambris, 2016; van de Beek et al., 2016a). The activation of these TLRs and NLRs leads to the activation of inflammatory transcription factors, in particular the nuclear factor NF-kB, which amongst others may lead to increased complement protein production through TLR-complement crosstalk, though this remains largely unexplored (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2011; Lian et al., 2015; Hajishengallis and Lambris, 2016).

Several studies included blood and/or CSF complement measurements and correlated results to disease severity and outcome (Table 2) (Greenwood et al., 1976; Whittle and Greenwood, 1977; Zwahlen et al., 1982; Stahel et al., 1997; Goonetilleke et al., 2010, 2012; Woehrl et al., 2011; Adriani et al., 2013; Brouwer et al., 2013; Lucas et al., 2013; Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014; Kasanmoentalib et al., 2017). The techniques used for measuring complement levels have varied over time and studies included different distributions of causative pathogens. Despite this heterogeneity among publications, it remains evident that massive complement system activation occurs in the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis. Concentrations of C1q, MBL, MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP2), factor B, factor H, C3a, iC3b, C5a, and MAC in the CSF of the diagnostic lumbar puncture were all significantly elevated compared to control CSF (for instance of patients with thunderclap headache) (Stahel et al., 1997; Brouwer et al., 2013; Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014). Although many patients with bacterial meningitis have bacteraemia or sepsis, data on serum complement levels in bacterial meningitis patients are scarce, and only two studies have assessed paired complement levels in serum and in the CSF (Zwahlen et al., 1982; Goonetilleke et al., 2012). To date, studies including serial blood sampling to determine complement activation profiles of patients with acute bacterial meningitis are lacking. Similar to in bacterial meningitis, focus of research in sepsis shifted from the pathogenicity of the causative pathogen towards the dysregulated hosts’ systemic inflammatory and immune response (Hotchkiss et al., 2016). Differences in complement activation between patients with uncomplicated sepsis and patients who eventually died were already identified over 40 years ago (McCabe, 1973). An increased degree of complement activation is also associated with unfavourable outcome in bacterial meningitis. High concentrations of C1q, MASP2, C5a and MAC in the CSF of the diagnostic puncture have been significantly associated with mortality in pneumococcal meningitis (Goonetilleke et al., 2010; Woehrl et al., 2011; Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014; Kasanmoentalib et al., 2017). High levels of C5a in the CSF were also associated with development of the detrimental complication of delayed cerebral thrombosis later in the disease course (Lucas et al., 2013). Patients with this devastating complication suddenly deteriorate after initial recovery, developing headache, fever, a decreased level of consciousness, brainstem signs, or hemiparesis due to inflammation and brain infarction (Schut et al., 2009). Low CSF C3 levels indicating complement consumption due to massive complement activation have also been associated with mortality (Zwahlen et al., 1982; Goonetilleke et al., 2010, 2012). Differences are described between causative pathogens. In contrast to pneumococcal meningitis, high MAC levels in meningococcal meningitis were associated with favourable outcome (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014). In addition, CSF C5a and MAC levels were significantly higher in patients with pneumococcal meningitis than in patients with meningococcal meningitis, even when corrected for age, immunocompromised state, and level of consciousness (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014).

Data on the deposition of complement components in the brain is limited as it has not been thoroughly evaluated by any of the few case series of autopsied bacterial meningitis patients (Engelen-Lee et al., 2016). Strong and specific staining of the C3a receptor was seen in astrocytes, microglia and infiltrating cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in brain tissue of bacterial meningitis patients, as was true for the C5a receptor for non-bacterial meningitis brain inflammation (Gasque et al., 1998).

Experimental rationale for complement system targets
The effects of complement system intervention on bacterial killing and spurring inflammation have been investigated in various experimental studies. Intervening early in the complement cascade by targeting the initiating pathways has the potential benefit of limiting the production of anaphylatoxin C3a, but may impair its opsonophagocytic function. This is illustrated by various in vitro opsonophagocytosis assays, showing reduced opsonization and phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae in classical (C1q) and lectin pathway (MASP-2) deficient mice and human serum, and may lead to increased bacterial outgrowth in in vivo models (Brown et al., 2002; Yuste et al., 2008; Ali et al., 2012). Targeting the alternative pathway does not alter opsonization as significantly. Opsonization of S. pneumoniae was less intense for sera of factor B-deficient mice (Brown et al., 2002), and only limited for some S. pneumoniae strains in human factor B-depleted serum resulting in only mild impairment of phagocytosis (Yuste et al., 2008). Properdin to stabilize C3-convertase significantly improved opsonization of both S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis in serum (Ali et al., 2014). Targeting C3 itself, as illustrated in rats and rabbits that were enzymatically depleted of C3 following intraperitoneal injection of cobra venom factor, a proteolytic activator of C3 and C5, almost completely abolishes opsonizing function resulting in an increased bacterial outgrowth (Crosson et al., 1976; Tuomanen et al., 1986). Targeting C5 conversion, C5a, or the C5a receptor has the benefit of not limiting opsonization, while still targeting the production of the most potent anaphylatoxin C5a. The chemotactic activity of C5a in the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been recognized for a long time (Ernst et al., 1984). Intrathecally administered human C5a in rabbits resulted in a rapid leucocytosis (Kadurugamuwa et al., 1989).

Several models of experimental bacterial meningitis have been used, either investigating the difference between wild-type and complement-deficient mice (Rupprecht et al., 2007; Woehrl et al., 2011; Kasanmoentalib et al., 2017), or using adjunctive complement-targeted therapies (Table 3) (Crosson et al., 1976; Tuomanen et al., 1986; Zwijnenburg et al., 2007; Woehrl et al., 2011; Kasanmoentalib et al., 2015, 2017; Klein et al., 2018). Most models investigated pneumococcal meningitis. The development of experimental meningococcal meningitis models has been hindered by the exclusivity of this pathogen to humans. Classical pathway deficiency (C1q) was associated with lower rates of intracranial complications and lower CSF leucocyte count, but higher mortality rates due to increased bacterial outgrowth and septicaemia (Rupprecht et al., 2007). Adjunctive treatment with a classical pathway inhibitor (C1-INH, inhibitor of C1r and C1s) also attenuated CSF leucocyte count and cytokine and chemokine response and reduced clinical illness measures (Zwijnenburg et al., 2007). Surprisingly, C1-INH treated rats and mice had reduced bacterial outgrowth, possibly related to increased CR3-receptor expression, improving phagocytic function in spite of impaired opsonization. Lectin pathway deficiency (MASP-2) improved survival, and adjunctive treatment with MASP-2 antibodies in adjunction to standard care with dexamethasone and antibiotics significantly reduced progression of clinical severity scores and non-significantly lowered mortality rates (Kasanmoentalib et al., 2017). C3-deficient mice had increased bacterial outgrowth and increased mortality (Rupprecht et al., 2007). Whilst different from treatment in meningitis, C3-inhibition by compstatin in a baboon E. coli sepsis model had organ-protective effects, even when administered after sepsis induction (Silasi-Mansat et al., 2010; Mastellos et al., 2015). Most clear is the evidence resulting from experimental models investigating targeting C5a. Mice with C5a receptor deficiency had reduced inflammation and improved clinical scores (Woehrl et al., 2011). Adjunctive treatment with C5-antibody therapy, preventing C5 conversion to C5a, was significantly associated with decreased mortality, improved neuroscore and clinical score, and less frequent cerebral haemorrhages (Woehrl et al., 2011). A subsequent investigator-blinded experimental model showed that combined treatment with dexamethasone and C5 antibodies significantly reduced mortality when compared to placebo, and also when compared with dexamethasone and C5-antibody therapy alone (Kasanmoentalib et al., 2015). A recently published experimental pneumococcal meningitis model comparing the use of ceftriaxone with different combinations of dexamethasone, daptomycin, IL1-antibody, roscovitine and C5a antibodies in mice, showed most favourable results for the combination of daptomycin and anti-C5 antibody (Klein et al., 2018). Mice treated with adjunctive dexamethasone and C5-antibody had similar clinical scores and survival (all mice survived), but had higher hearing thresholds and CSF leucocyte count (Klein et al., 2018). An experimental study comparing different complement interventions in the same model has not been performed, while this would overcome the limitation of comparing heterogeneous models, using different bacterial strains with varying pathogenicity (for instance S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6303 has shown to be more lethal than D39 in wild-type mice) (Kostyukova et al., 1995; Lim et al., 2007).

Therapeutic options
Targeting the complement system in bacterial meningitis has the goal to decrease complications deriving from the uncontrolled, massive inflammatory response in the CNS, mainly driven by anaphylatoxin C5a production. To date, only two complement-targeted drugs, eculizumab (Alexion) and C1-INH [Cinryze (Shire), Berinert (CSL Behring), Cetor (Sanquin), Ruconest/conestat alfa (Pharming)], have received approval for its use in clinical practice, but dozens are currently investigated in one or multiple clinical trials covering almost the whole complement cascade, each with its own benefits and caveats (Ricklin et al., 2017; Harris, 2018).

The main detrimental effects of complement activation are considered to be caused by the spurring inflammatory effects of the complement system further upstream. The caveat of targeting the initiating pathway is the resulting opsonization deficit that may result in decreased bacterial killing (Brown et al., 2002), neither is complement activation in bacterial meningitis restricted to a single pathway. A potential advantage of intervening early in the complement system is the inhibition of the anaphylatoxin C3a produced early in the complement cascade, but no data to date support the importance of this less potent anaphylatoxin in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis (Woehrl et al., 2011; Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014). C4a does not share the inflammatory activities of C3a and C5a, and therefore should not be considered as an anaphylatoxin (Barnum, 2015). Targeting the amplification loop or C3 has the benefit of reducing complement amplification and concurrent massive anaphylatoxin production irrespective of the initiation pathway, but was not found to be beneficial in experimental meningitis models (Table 3). None of these models included antibiotic treatment, which may have over-emphasized the impaired opsonophagocytosis. Nevertheless, a C3-bypass mechanism has been shown with thrombin to be able to act as a potent C5 convertase in the absence of C3, in a dose-dependent manner (Huber-Lang et al., 2006). This suggests conversion to C5a can still occur in patients despite total blockage of C3, further limiting it as a good treatment option in bacterial meningitis.

Experimental evidence makes targeting C5a, the anaphylatoxin most broadly associated with disease severity and clinical outcome, the most promising therapeutic intervention to add to the current treatment regimen for bacterial meningitis patients. Three strategies are available to target C5a production. This includes targeting C5 to prevent conversion to C5a and C5b, specifically targeting C5a, or targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR). A multitude of therapeutic options has been developed to accomplish this (Supplementary Table 1). Eculizumab is a monoclonal C5 antibody registered for PNH, aHUS and generalized myasthenia gravis (Hillmen et al., 2006; Legendre et al., 2013; Howard et al., 2017). Functional C5a generation ex vivo despite eculizumab treatment in extreme complement activation situations has, however, been reported (Harder et al., 2017). Also in patients with aHUS, C5a was only partly suppressed to normal range or above (Wehling et al., 2017).

The major problem with targeting C5 conversion is the inhibition of MAC formation. The MAC complex is not considered as a modulator of the inflammatory response, although blockage is considered harmful as it may limit bacterial killing, especially in patients with meningococcal meningitis. In these patients, low concentration of the MAC complex in CSF was significantly associated with unfavourable clinical outcome despite subsequent administration of antibiotics, warranting caution (Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014). Exemplary, eculizumab, abrogates meningococcal killing in whole blood (Konar and Granoff, 2017), and patients treated with eculizumab are at high risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease even when vaccinated (McNamara et al., 2017).

An alternative approach might be to use anti-C5a or C5a receptor antagonists, which are more selective than eculizumab, and have been shown to inhibit the potentially harmful effects of N. meningitidis-induced C5a formation, at least in vitro, while preserving complement-mediated meningococcal killing via MAC (Sprong et al., 2003; Herrmann et al., 2018). It is therefore assumed that specific C5a targeting will be safe, even for patients with meningococcal meningitis. Of note, the effect of anti-C5 antibodies in bacterial meningitis other than pneumococcal meningitis is unclear and needs to be carefully evaluated. Two monoclonal antibodies against C5a exist to date, IFX-1 (InflaRx) and ALXN1007 (Alexion) (Supplementary Table 1). Targeting the C5a receptor with Avacopan/CCX168 (Chemocentryx) or IPH5401 (Innate Pharma) is another option (Supplementary Table 1).

The blood–CNS barrier (either the blood–brain barrier or the blood–CSF barrier) protects and regulates the homeostasis of the brain. However, this barrier also limits the access of drugs to the brain, posing—in spite of increased permeability due to inflammation—several challenges for C5-targeted therapies to cross the blood–CNS barrier, which to date have only partially been unravelled (Nau et al., 2010; Mook-Kanamori et al., 2011; Carpanini et al., 2019; Tattevin et al., 2019): monoclonal antibodies such as eculizumab and IFX-1 do not cross the blood–brain barrier, though ∼0.1% of circulating antibodies penetrate in the CNS with a hypothetically increasing proportion due to inflammation (Freskgård and Urich, 2017). Eculizumab reduced the attack frequency in AQP4-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, a disease where the blood–CNS barrier is disrupted (Pittock et al., 2013; Carpanini et al., 2019).

Small-molecules (<400 Da) can passively diffuse into the CNS if they are lipophilic (Freskgård and Urich, 2017). Small peptides (Zilucoplan) have the advantage of increased blood–CNS barrier penetration, stressing the importance of these treatments in neurological disease without blood–CNS barrier breaching, such as Alzheimer’s disease (Craik et al., 2013; Baig et al., 2018). In addition, several new techniques are in development to accomplish brain delivery, such as receptor-mediated transport and transcytosis to shuttle therapeutics into the brain, or manipulating the blood–CNS barrier through signalling cascades, and barrier gene expression (Oller-Salvia et al., 2016; Greenwood et al., 2017).

It is also important to acknowledge that effectivity of complement inhibition may differ between patients. Patients with more pronounced complement activation due to genetic variations will likely benefit more from complement intervention (Harris et al., 2012; Kavanagh et al., 2015). Moreover, some patients may not respond to certain treatments because of mutations, as is seen with eculizumab (Nishimura et al., 2014). Some patients are therefore likely to require a tailored approach. The acute disease course of bacterial meningitis limits the options for extensive workup before enrolling patients in a clinical trial to reduce the risk of false-negative trial designs. Timely bedside genetic biomarkers are currently not available. Another important factor for trial design in bacterial meningitis is the variety in causative pathogens. Patients with pneumococcal meningitis have significantly more pronounced complement activation in the CSF and are therefore more likely to benefit from complement inhibition. Previously, the benefit of dexamethasone was shown to be most pronounced in patients with pneumococcal meningitis (de Gans et al., 2002; Bijlsma et al., 2016). CSF Gram staining or bedside PCR may identify the causative pathogen relatively quick compared to CSF culture, but will inevitably lead to treatment delays. As complement inhibition is considered most beneficial when started early, it makes sense to treat all patients with bacterial meningitis till the causative pathogen is identified.

Conclusion
There is a multitude of evidence that confirms the importance of complement system activation in bacterial meningitis. Patients with genetic complement deficiencies, and/or lower complement levels in the CSF tend to have favourable outcome. Experimental animal studies have increasingly shown the important regulatory function of the complement system in spurring the inflammatory response in bacterial meningitis. Amongst all complement components, C5a was most significantly associated with unfavourable outcome, both the genetic variation in complement component 5 gene and the anaphylatoxin C5a concentration in the CSF. The experimental results of targeting anaphylatoxin C5a production have been very promising. Three separate experimental studies significantly favoured treatment with C5 monoclonal antibodies, one of which was a randomized investigator-blinded trial. C5 monoclonal antibodies also showed to be beneficial when given in adjunction to the standard treatment regimen with antibiotics and dexamethasone as proposed in the current ESCMID guideline for acute bacterial meningitis (van de Beek et al., 2016b). Specific targeting of the anaphylatoxin C5a or its receptor C5aR, therefore, emerges as the most promising treatment target. Targeting the initiating pathways, C3 or C5 all have their caveats, mainly due to the opsonophagocytosis deficits, complement bypass routes, and/or inhibiting MAC formation. The promising results of the experimental models warrant the initiation of a randomized clinical phase IIb or III trial with concomitant genetic profiling of host and pathogen to determine its interactions with complement intervention to allow for future patient stratification. Possible candidates for clinical trials are currently IFX-1 (InflaRx), ALXN1007 (Alexion), Avacopan/CCX168 (Chemocentryx), and IPH5401 (Innate Pharma). The initiation of clinical trials and the clinical use of complement-targeted therapies for bacterial meningitis may be further spurred in the future when more economical therapeutic options have become available.
