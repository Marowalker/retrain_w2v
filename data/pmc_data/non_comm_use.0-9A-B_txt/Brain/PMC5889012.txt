Kiernan, Jürgen Götz, Maria Grazia Spillantini, John R. Hodges, Lars M. Ittner, Glenda M. Halliday. Retiring the term FTDP-17 as MAPT mutations are genetic forms of sporadic frontotemporal tauopathies. Brain 2018; 141: 521–534; doi: 10.1093/brain/awx328.

The authors would like to apologize for an error in the abstract. The sentence:

Ten FTLD-tau cases with a MAPT mutation (K257T, S3035S, P301L, IVS10+16, R406W) were screened for the core differentiating neuropathological features used to diagnose the different sporadic FTLD-tau subtypes to determine whether the categorical separation of MAPT mutations from sporadic FTLD-tau is valid.

should read as follows:

Ten FTLD-tau cases with a MAPT mutation (K257T, S305S, P301L, IVS10+16, R406W) were screened for the core differentiating neuropathological features used to diagnose the different sporadic FTLD-tau subtypes to determine whether the categorical separation of MAPT mutations from sporadic FTLD-tau is valid.

This error has been corrected online.
