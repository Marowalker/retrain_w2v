Abigail B. Diack, Aileen Boyle, Christopher Plinston, Emma Hunt, Matthew T. Bishop, Robert G. Will and Jean C. Manson. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strain is identical in individuals of two PRNP codon 129 genotypes. Brain 2019; 142: 1416–1428, doi:10.1093/brain/awz076.

In the original version of this article, the abstract mistakenly read ‘129 methionine/valine individuals’, rather than the correct ‘129 methionine/methionine individuals’. The corrected line now reads:

While some differences were observed at primary and first subpassage, following the second subpassage, strain characteristics in the methionine/valine individual were totally consistent with those of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmitted to 129 methionine/methionine individuals thus demonstrated no alteration in strain properties were imposed by passage through the different host genotype.

The article has been corrected both online and in print; the authors wish to apologize for this error.
