The authors would like to apologise for Figs 5 and 6 being displayed in the wrong order.


Figures 5 and 6 should look and read as follows:


Figure 5 
Transient stimulation-induced driving of neuronal activity. (A) Representative example of the transient driving of neuronal activity at the start of a 100 Hz and 200 Hz stimulation train at a recording site in a single patient (with stimulus artefacts removed and represented with shaded box). (B) Box-and-whisker plots describing the transient driving responses. The figures show the 10th and 90th percentiles, first and third quartiles, and median of the firing rate, duration, number of spikes, and onset latency of the driving responses. There was a significant difference in all values except firing rate. *P<0.05, **P<0.05, †P<0.001.

Figure 6 
Representative example of tremor phase resets at the start of a 100 Hz (A) and 200 Hz (B) stimulation train. A tremor phase reset is present at the start of the stimulation train, which closely follows the initial stimulation-induced neuronal driving response of the cell. This is likely due to a thalamo-cortical activation of motor cortical areas during the driving response, before the subsequent neuronal inhibition (and tremor suppression) occurs.

All corrections have now been implemented online.
