Abstract
The most common form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia is caused by
mutations in the SPG11/KIAA1840 gene on chromosome 15q.
The nature of the vast majority of SPG11 mutations found to date suggests
a loss-of-function mechanism of the encoded protein, spatacsin. The SPG11 phenotype is, in
most cases, characterized by a progressive spasticity with neuropathy, cognitive
impairment and a thin corpus callosum on brain MRI. Full neuropathological
characterization has not been reported to date despite the description of >100
SPG11 mutations. We describe here the clinical and pathological
features observed in two unrelated females, members of genetically ascertained SPG11
families originating from Belgium and Italy, respectively. We confirm the presence of
lesions of motor tracts in medulla oblongata and spinal cord associated with other lesions
of the central nervous system. Interestingly, we report for the first time pathological
hallmarks of SPG11 in neurons that include intracytoplasmic granular lysosome-like
structures mainly in supratentorial areas, and others in subtentorial areas that are
partially reminiscent of those observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, such as
ubiquitin and p62 aggregates, except that they are never labelled with anti-TDP-43 or
anti-cystatin C. The neuropathological overlap with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
associated with some shared clinical manifestations, opens up new fields of investigation
in the physiopathological continuum of motor neuron degeneration.

==== Body
Introduction
Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurodegenerative diseases, which include a large
spectrum of inherited disorders presenting with lower limb spasticity as the common clinical
feature (Harding, 1983). They are usually
classified according to their clinical presentation, pattern of inheritance, age at onset
and, more recently, their putative physiopathological mechanism (Finsterer et al., 2012; Fink, 2013; Lo Giudice
et al., 2014; Tesson
et al., 2015). Traditionally, and according to clinical
criteria, which remains the most operative for nosographic classification, two forms of the
disease are considered: the pure or uncomplicated forms, which represent the most frequent
HSPs in European countries, and the complex or complicated forms, which are more frequent in
recessively inherited HSP and therefore in countries with a higher rate of consanguinity
(Boukhris et al., 2009;
Ruano et al., 2014).
Besides the spasticity, the latter form is often characterized by one or more additional
neurological symptoms, such as peripheral neuropathy, dementia or intellectual disability,
cerebellar ataxia, optic atrophy, deafness, retinopathy, etc. (Harding, 1983). The variety of inheritance modes (autosomal
dominant, autosomal recessive, mitochondrial and X-linked) and of mutated genes (>70)
contributes to further heterogeneity of these neurodegenerative diseases (Tesson et al., 2015).

One of the most common (14 to 26%) autosomal recessive spastic paraplegias (AR-HSP) is
caused by mutations in the SPG11/KIAA1840 gene on
chromosome 15q (SPG11; MIM 610844) (Stevanin et al., 2007, 2008; Boukhris et al.,
2009; Crimella et al.,
2009; Denora et al.,
2009; Schüle et al.,
2009; Coutinho et al.,
2013; Ishiura et al.,
2014; Pensato et al.,
2014). This form is, in most cases, characterized by a combination of progressive
spasticity, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy and a thin corpus callosum on brain
MRI (Hehr et al., 2007; Stevanin et al., 2008; Denora et al., 2009). Atypical
cases of autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with long disease
duration (Orlacchio et al.,
2010; Daoud et al.,
2012) or with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Montecchiani et al., 2016) have also been found with mutations in
SPG11. The nature of the vast majority of SPG11
mutations found to date suggests a mechanism of loss-of-function of the encoded protein,
spatacsin. The function of spatacsin is indeed largely unknown but its interaction with
AP5Z1 (SPG48) (Słabicki et al.,
2010), a member of the adaptor-protein complex 5, suggests that it plays a role in
intracellular trafficking (Hirst et
al., 2013) and endolysosomal homeostasis in particular (Hirst et al., 2015). An abnormal
anterograde trafficking has also been demonstrated in neurons derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells of SPG11 patients (Pérez-Branguli et al., 2014). Recently, its requirement for
lysosome turnover and autophagy has also been evidenced (Chang et al., 2014; Renvoisé et al., 2014; Varga et al., 2015). Finally, the consequences of
its knock-down in zebrafish (Martin et
al., 2012; Southgate et
al., 2010), together with the early age at onset in most patients,
suggest a role for this gene during development of the CNS.

Neuropathological reports of cases with spastic paraplegia are sparse and often without
genetic–aetiological considerations. We report here the clinical and pathological
description of two unrelated female autopsy cases, members of genetically ascertained SPG11
families originating from Belgium and Italy, respectively. We show that motor neuron
degeneration, particularly in spinal cord and medulla oblongata, presents with histological
lesions and immunolabelling partially reminiscent of those observed in ALS. This illustrates
the overlap between HSPs and ALS and should help to improve our understanding of the
physiopathological continuum of motor neuron degeneration. We also show that lysosomal-like
granules accumulate in agreement with the potential role of spatacsin.

Materials and methods
Neuropathological studies
Full neuropathological examination was conducted according to classical methods,
including frozen and paraffin sections for the Belgian case (Patient BG-2). Only paraffin
sections from frontal cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, medulla oblongata and cervical
spinal cord were available for the Italian case (Patient IT). Brain sampling followed the
ethical rules of each country.

Frozen sections were stained for myelin (Spielmeyer), cytology (Nissl), fibrillary glia
(Holzer) and neutral fats (Sudan III). Paraffin sections were stained for cytology (Nissl,
haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome), axons (Bodian silver impregnation), myelin
(Klüver-Barrera) and carbohydrate macromolecules (periodic acid-Schiff stain).

Stored formalin-fixed samples of the lumbar spinal cord as well as deparaffinized spinal
ganglia were further processed by an additional 24 h fixation in 4% glutaraldehyde for
conventional electron microscopy. After post-fixation in 2% osmium tetroxide, blocks were
embedded in Araldite®. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate and examined under an FEI CM10 Philips transmission electron microscope.

Immunostaining was performed using the citrate buffer epitope retrieval method.
Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation for 20 min at room temperature in a
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.1% Triton™ X-100 (Sigma) solution containing 10%
methanol and 0.003% H2O2. Microscope slides carrying brain sections
were washed three times and incubated in the blocking solution (0.1% PBS, 4% Triton™
X-100, 4% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature.
Sections were then incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies (Supplementary Table 1) diluted in
blocking solution against the following proteins: cystatin C, ubiquitin, calbindin 28 kD,
neurofilaments SMI31 and SMI32, hyperphosphorylated protein tau AT8,
amyloid-β17–24 4G8, TDP-43, GFAP, spatacsin, FUS, p62 and cathepsin D.
Sections were washed three times, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the
corresponding biotinylated appropriate (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) secondary antibody
(1:250; Vector Laboratories) diluted in blocking solution and washed another three times.
Bound antibodies were visualized using the ABC amplification system (Vectastain ABC kit,
Vector Laboratories) with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB Metal Concentrate;
Biogenex) as the substrate. The sections, nuclearly counterstained with haematoxylin or
not, were dehydrated twice in ethanol and xylene solutions and mounted with Eukitt®.

Neuronal loss, gliosis and atrophy were semiquantitatively assessed and estimated as
severe, moderate or absent by two different observers.

Genetic analyses
Mutation screening of Patient IT (Italy) used an amplicon-based Sanger sequencing method
focused on the SPG11 gene, as previously reported (Stevanin et al., 2007).

DNA of the autopsy Patient BG-2 (Belgium) was not available but DNA from her affected
sister Patient BG-3 (Supplementary Fig.
1) was subjected to whole exome sequencing using the SureSelect 50Mb capture kit
(Agilent) followed by massive parallel sequencing in the Illumina HighSeq2000 sequencer.
Sequence alignment to the human genome and variant annotation were performed as described
elsewhere (Gonzalez et al.,
2014).

Results
Clinical outline of Italian and Belgian patients
The Italian proband Patient IT (Supplementary Fig. 1) was female, born by normal full-term delivery, after an
uneventful pregnancy. Her parents, of Italian ancestry, were healthy and unrelated. Her
initial growth and development were normal. Onset of the disease manifested at the age of
10 years as a learning disability (Table 1).
At 12 years of age, she developed a mild motor disability, which progressed to a severe
spastic-ataxic gait at age 18 years; walking was possible with one stick. At age 31 years
she was wheelchair-bound. Sagittal and axial T1-weighted and coronal
T2-weighted brain MRI (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B), performed at age 14, showed corpus callosum
thinning, diffuse white matter abnormalities in frontal, occipital, temporal and
periventricular regions and atrophy of frontal and occipital brain regions. MRI
examination performed at age 24 years (Supplementary Fig. 2C) confirmed the severe evolution of the white matter and
cortical abnormalities. Neurological examination at 27 years, when she was
wheelchair-bound, showed lower and upper limb spasticity with brisk reflexes as well as
extrapyramidal rigidity, cerebellar ataxia in the four limbs, dementia and dysarthria, and
distal amyotrophy suggesting axonal peripheral neuropathy. No fasciculations were seen at
that time. Electroneuromyographic (ENMG) and nerve conduction velocity recordings
performed in the following years revealed slightly reduced amplitudes of compound motor
action potentials, while amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials and motor and
sensory nerve conduction velocities (38 m/s in the tibial nerve, 48 m/s in the median
nerve) were normal. ENMG of the tibialis anterior muscle showed chronic denervation with
long durations and large amplitudes of motor unit action potentials. The patient died
severely demented at 32 years of age of cardiopulmonary arrest; a brain autopsy was
performed 48 h after death. Focused SPG11 gene analysis was performed by
direct sequencing in this patient.

Proband BG-2 was also female (Supplementary Fig. 1). Her parents of Belgian origin were healthy and related.
Onset of the disease, at age 10 years, was characterized by incoordination of all four
limbs and intentional tremor; subsequently, a stiff gait was noted. She had mild
intellectual disability. She developed a spastic cerebellar ataxic gait that progressed
rapidly (Table 1). At age 20 years she was
wheelchair-bound. She had sporadic generalized epileptic seizures. The EEG was normal at
that time. MRI of the brain was performed at age 36 years. T2-weighted images
showed diffuse white matter lesions in periventricular areas and diffuse atrophy of the
brain. Neurological examination at age 36 years showed pyramidal signs with brisk reflexes
in all four limbs and bilateral Babinski sign, cerebellar ataxia, distal atrophy in all
four limbs and bilateral pes cavus. By age 45 years she had complete quadriparesis, claw
hands and bulbar palsy with dysphagia and dysarthria. Severe feeding problems arose due to
the dysphagia and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was needed. No ENMG
examination was performed at this stage of the disease. She developed bradypsychia and
dementia. She died at the age of 46 years, severely demented. Brain and spinal cord
autopsy was performed 24 h after death.

Patient BG-1, brother of proband Patient BG-2, is still alive at age 53 years and also
has mild intellectual disability (Table 1).
The disease started at 18 years of age. He developed an ataxic gait and later on, a
stiffness in the lower limbs. Distal amyotrophy was seen in all four limbs, with claw
hands. By age 29 years, he was wheelchair-bound due to a severe spastic ataxic gait. No
dementia and no bulbar palsy were seen in this patient.

Patient BG-3, sister of proband Patient BG-2 is still alive at age 51 years. She also has
mild intellectual disability. Onset of the disease was at age 10 years (Table 1). First, she had a wide-based cerebellar
ataxia. Later on a spastic gait developed with distal amyotrophy in all limbs. She had pes
cavus. She became wheelchair-bound at the age of 20 years. She had dysarthric speech and
saccadic eye movements by age 24 years. The distal muscles became severely atrophied and
she developed complete bilateral drop-foot and claw hands. Sporadic generalized epileptic
seizures were seen. Her EEG was normal. An ENMG examination performed in the upper limbs
at age 42 years showed normal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity responses (49
m/s and 53 m/s in the right ulnar and median nerves) with normal amplitudes of the action
potentials. Signs of chronic neurogenic degeneration with large motor units (polyphasic or
giant motor unit potentials) were seen in the thenar and hypothenar muscles and in the
first interosseous muscles. No clinical signs of bulbar involvement were observed in this
patient. Cognitive function remained normal. MRI of the brain performed at age 25 years
showed a thin corpus callosum. Whole exome sequence analysis was performed in this
patient. Both Belgian parents are deceased.

Genetic analyses
Whole exome sequencing in Patient BG-3 revealed the homozygous truncating mutation
c.6739_6742delGAGT (p.Glu2247Leufs*14) in exon 36 of SPG11. This mutation
was reported previously in other cases (Stevanin
et al., 2008) and was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Direct Sanger sequencing of all exons of the SPG11 gene in Patient IT
revealed two unreported heterozygous truncating mutations; c.2358_2359delinsTT
(p.Glu786_Gly787delinsAspfs*) in exon 13 and c.4868delT (p.Leu1623Tyrfs*17) in exon 28.
The two mutations were heterozygous in healthy parents, the c.4868delT being found in the
father and the c.2358-2359delinsTT in the mother (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Macroscopic and myelinic modifications of brain autopsies
The autopsy of Patient IT was limited to brain and upper cervical spinal cord. The brain
was not weighed, but the examination confirmed the data obtained by MRI, with atrophy of
the cerebellum, particularly of the vermis. The corpus callosum was also thin.

The autopsy of Patient BG-2 was also limited to the brain, which weighed 950 g, and to
the thoraco-lumbo-sacral spinal cord. Macroscopic examination revealed mild atrophy of the
frontal lobe, severe thinning of the corpus callosum, dilatation of the ventricular system
and a greyish aspect of the white matter, especially in subcortical areas. There was some
depigmentation of the substantia nigra, a slight atrophy of the pons and atrophy of the
pyramids in the medulla oblongata as well as a thinning of the spinal cord. There was no
cerebellar atrophy but an artificial discoloration of the inner granular cell layer; the
so-called état glacé.

Myelin stains on frozen and paraffin sections in the Belgian Patient BG-2 showed a myelin
pallor of the white matter in the cerebral hemispheres and a demyelination of the corpus
callosum (Supplementary Fig.
2E). There was also demyelination of the pyramidal pathways in the medulla
oblongata and the spinal cord (crossed and uncrossed tracts), of the dorsal and ventral
spinocerebellar tracts and also of the fasciculus gracilis. Myelin staining of spinal cord
of Patient IT (Klüver-Barrera stain alone or associated with Bodian silver impregnation)
showed degeneration of crossed and uncrossed pyramidal tracts. The atrophy also involved
the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts and the fasciculus gracilis in the posterior columns
(Supplementary Fig. 2D).

CNS neuronal loss and astrogliosis
Cytological stains (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome, cresyl violet) revealed
neuronal loss in various regions of the CNS in both patients (Table 2). In both cases, the frontal cortex was severely altered,
particularly the gyrus cinguli, the frontal gyri, mainly in the third layer and, to a
lesser extent, the temporal gyri. Only a few, although shrunken, Betz neurons remained in
the precentral gyrus. In the thalamus, focal neuronal loss was severe in the mediodorsal
nucleus and the lateral dorsal nucleus in both patients. The caudate and putamen nuclei
were only moderately affected in Patient IT and were spared in Patient BG-2. Lesions in
the brainstem were heterogeneous. The reticular formation was spared, but moderate
(nucleus X and principal olivary nucleus) to severe neuronal loss (hypoglossal, gracilis
and cuneate nuclei) was observed in other brainstem regions in the two cases. In Patient
BG-2, neuronal loss was evidenced in the ventro-lateral part of the zona compacta of the
substantia nigra but not in the pontine locus coeruleus (these structures were not
available for Patient IT). The cerebellar cortex was only atrophied in Patient IT with
loss of Purkinje and granule cells (Supplementary Fig. 2F). Anti-calbindin 28 kD immunolabelling in Patient IT
confirmed the rarefaction of Purkinje cells (data not shown). Deep cerebellar nuclei were
not examined in the Italian patient but there was no abnormality in the Belgian patient
(data not shown). Finally, the spinal cord was severely affected in the two cases.

Astrocytic reaction was evidenced by Holzer stain in Patient BG-2 and by anti-GFAP
immunohistochemistry in two patients (Table
2). A mild fibrillary gliosis in the frontal and temporal white matter and in the
middle third of the corpus callosum on a vertico-frontal section was observed in Patient
BG-2 while astrogliosis was more severe in Patient IT, particularly in frontal cortex,
thalamus, cerebellum and spinal cord, and was moderate in basal ganglia and brainstem.

Neutral fat staining, performed in Patient BG-2 only, in the absence of frozen tissues
from Patient IT, was unremarkable.

Cytological anomalies
Masson’s trichrome, Sudan black, Klüver-Barrera (Fig. 1B) or Nissl staining revealed abundant lipofuscin granules in several
parts of the brain and particularly in cerebral, pontine and medullar neurons of both
patients. In addition, granular eosinophilic (Fig.
1A) and PAS+ (periodic acid Schiff) structures different from classical
lipofuscin granules by size and polycyclic shape were found in the perikaryon of remaining
motor neurons of hypoglossal nucleus and the anterior horns of the spinal cord.
Anti-cathepsin D evidenced in both patients abundant granules, reminiscent of lysosomes,
with variable shape and size in neurons from several brain regions, more precisely in
subtentorial areas (Supplementary Fig.
3A). Ubiquitin (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 3C) and p62
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. 3B)
immunoreactive coarse granules or beaded inclusions were also found in remaining perikarya
of motor neurons in medulla oblongata and spinal cord and in spinal ganglionic cells. The
anti-ubiquitin and anti-p62 antibodies did not reveal such structures in cortex, basal
ganglia or cerebellum, however none of these inclusions were immunostained by
anti-cystatin C (Fig. 1F) or anti-TDP43 (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. 3D). 

Figure 1 
Neuronal rarefactions and presence of inclusions in the hypoglossal nucleus of
Patient BG-2. Similar features were observed in remaining neurons of the
anterior horns of the spinal cord (data not shown). Large eosinophilic inclusions are
observed in the neuronal perikarya (arrows) after haematoxylin and eosin
(A) or Klüver-Barrera (B, blue) staining. Numerous
inclusions (arrows) are immunoreactive for ubiquitin (C) or p62
(D). No labelling of the inclusions was evidenced with an anti-TDP-43
(E) or an anti-cystatin C antibody (F). Scale bars = 50
µm. 

Figure 2 
Spinal ganglion of Patient BG-2. Haematoxylin and eosin staining
highlighted large, mostly eosinophilic inclusions in the perikarya of the ganglion
cell neurons (A, arrows). Similar irregular inclusions were observed in
the neuronal perikarya by Klüver-Barrera staining (B, arrows) or by an
anti-ubiquitin (C) or and anti-p62 (D) antibody
immunolabelling. The inclusions were not labelled by an anti-TDP-43 antibody
(E, arrows). Giant bodies or ‘retention bodies’ (arrows) were observed
at electron microscopy of a ganglion cell (F, low magnification;
G, high magnification of a giant body). Classical lipofuscin granules
were also present in these giant bodies (H). Scale bars:
immunohistochemistry = 50 µm; electron microscopy = 1 µm.

The labelling against SMI32, in Patient IT, revealed abnormal accumulation of
neurofilaments in motor neurons of pontine nuclei and of spinal cord (data not shown). No
abnormal immunoreactivity against SMI31 neurofilaments was detected in the two cases,
except for a few sparse spheroids and axon swellings in Patient IT.

The mutations of the SPG11 gene described in both patients are expected
to lead to the loss-of-function of the spatacsin protein by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
In agreement with this hypothesis, no immunolabelling with antibodies directed against
spatacsin developed and characterized by us (Murmu
et al., 2011), was obtained in brain paraffin sections from
the present cases (data not shown).

No Lewy bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques or intranuclear inclusions were
observed either by histological (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome or Bodian
silver impregnation) or immunohistochemical staining (phosphorylated alpha-synuclein,
hyperphosphorylated tau protein AT8 and amyloid-β 4G8 labelling). In addition, no anti-FUS
immunoreactivity was observed, neither in spinal motor neurons nor in the remaining
neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus, in contrast to positive anti-FUS inclusions observed
in a control case with frontotemporal dementia carrying a FUS mutation
(data not shown).

Dorsal root ganglia exploration in Patient BG-2
Ganglion neurons were also affected (such material was not available for Patient IT). We
observed, by haematoxylin and eosin staining, eosinophilic inclusions associated with
refringent non-eosinophilic droplets (Fig.
2A). These inclusions were also labelled by lipophilic Klüver-Barrera staining
(Fig. 2B). Their immunohistochemical
characterization showed that they were strongly ubiquitin-positive (Fig. 2C), and some were also p62-labelled (Fig. 2D). As in the case of motor neurons of cortex or spinal
cord, they were not stained by anti-TDP-43 (Fig.
2E).

Ultrastructural analysis of neuronal inclusions
Electron microscopy of deparaffinized spinal ganglia neurons of Patient BG-2 (Fig. 2F–H) showed many abnormal electron dense
storage materials: few giant bodies or ‘retention bodies’ (Fig. 2F arrows and Fig.
2G) (3–5 µm × 4–8 µm) with closely clustered lipofuscin granules associated with
multiple lipid droplets (Fig. 2G) and a
variety of heterogeneous aggregates (Fig.
2H).

In formalin-fixed anterior horns, motor neuronal perikarya showed large amounts of
lipofuscin granules with granular and osmiophilic amorphous aggregates but very rare
small-sized lipid droplets (Fig. 3A). Unusual
electron-lucent areas with no limiting membrane were closely intermingled with lipofuscin
in some neurons and they contained variable amounts of cross- and longitudinal sectioned
fibrillary filaments (Fig. 3B arrows). The
latter had a densified and coarse tubular appearance with occasional distortions at higher
magnifications (data not shown). A few deposits appeared partly wrapped in lipofuscin
granules. These abnormal deposits were not seen in neurons in which lipid droplets
appeared numerous and larger, such as usually observed. Finally, similar features were not
seen in control spinal cord neurons containing numerous lipofuscin granules and in a
proven case of ALS due to a C9orf72 abnormal repeat expansion (data not
shown).

Discussion
We report here the first neuropathological description of two patients with HSP from
genetically proven SPG11 families. The two cases share similar lesions, including cortical
atrophy, white matter involvement with myelin pallor and severe astrogliosis. They also
share a demyelination of the pyramidal pathways and loss of motor neurons in medulla
oblongata and anterior horns of spinal cord. The thalamus of the two cases was also
affected, especially the mediodorsal nucleus of Patient BG-2.

In contrast, there were some differences in severity of the lesions between the two cases
in the basal ganglia and cerebellum (Table 2).
The cerebellar cortex of Patient IT was severely affected after 22 years of disease duration
(onset at age 10 years), while it was spared in Patient BG-2 after 36 years of disease
duration (onset also at age 10 years) in spite of a cerebellar syndrome in both patients.
Patient BG-2 showed moderate gliosis of dentate nucleus that could however account for the
observed cerebellar ataxia. Why the involvement of specific neuronal populations and the
severity of the lesions varied between the two cases remain an unresolved question. Other
genetic or environmental factors might have played a role.

Other clinicopathological studies of HSP cases have been reported, but without genetic
investigations. More particularly, two reported cases share similar clinical and
neuropathological characteristics with ours (Wakabayashi et al., 2001; Kuru et al., 2005). After 37 years of disease duration, the first
patient had a slowly progressive spastic tetraplegia with mental deterioration and severe
amyotrophy. Marked cerebral atrophy with thin corpus callosum was shown by brain MRI. The
second patient had spastic paraplegia, mental retardation and amyotrophy with sensory
disturbances after a disease duration of 26 years. Interestingly, while the cerebellum was
atrophied in the first case, it was normal in the second case, which mimics the
heterogeneity also found in our two SPG11 patients. A severe thinning of the corpus callosum
was present in both autopsies. In these two published cases, the remaining neurons also
presented abundant eosinophilic and lipofuscin granules, which were partially identified as
anti-ubiquitin positive in one case (Wakabayashi
et al., 2001), but were not fully characterized. As between our
two cases, some differences between the two Japanese cases themselves could result from the
circumstances of death or different time in post-mortem examination. In addition, we cannot
exclude different genetic conditions in the two Japanese cases as the SPG11
gene was not tested.

Overlapping findings between our SPG11 cases and ALS
Our SPG11 patients partially shared various clinical and neuropathological features of
ALS.

The neuropathological features, especially observed in subtentorial areas, namely medulla
oblongata and spinal cord, including the dorsal columns, are reminiscent of findings
already observed in ALS, thus emphasizing a putative physiological link between
SPG11 mutations and some forms of ALS. In agreement with this
observation, SPG11 mutations were recently reported in autosomal
recessive juvenile ALS with unusual long disease durations (Orlacchio et al., 2010; Daoud et al., 2012). The brainstem and spinal
cord autopsy of one of these juvenile ALS patients mutated in SPG11
showed minor lesions after 33 years of disease duration (Orlacchio et al., 2010). Neuronal loss and
astrogliosis were limited to glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nuclei and to the anterior
horn of the spinal cord, and a myelin pallor was reported in the anterolateral columns.
The remaining motor neurons of the spinal cord showed central chromatolysis, pigmentary
degeneration and hyaline inclusions that were not characterized using immunohistochemistry
markers. Neither Bunina bodies nor skein-like inclusions were observed.

In our SPG11 cases, Bunina bodies were also not evidenced by the anti-cystatin-C
antibody. Peculiar observations were, however, found in our patients; the supratentorial
structures—namely frontotemporal cortex, basal ganglia and the thalamic mediodorsalis
nucleus—showed neuronal degeneration without the immunohistochemical landmark of ALS
pathology as we did not observe ubiquitin, p62, or TDP-43 immunoreactivity either in basal
ganglia or in the neocortex. In medulla oblongata and spinal cord, however, ubiquitin and
p62-positive granules were found. Indeed, the accumulation and/or aggregation of
neurofilaments in motor neuron perikarya and axons (axonal spheroids) together with the
abnormal topographic location of neurofilaments in the cell body are classical features
associated with familial and sporadic ALS (Delisle
and Carpenter, 1984; Xiao et
al., 2006).

Moreover, a clinical overlap between complicated HSP and ALS was overt in Patient BG-2.
In the end stage of her disease, there was a severe bulbar palsy in addition to severe
cerebellar dysarthria. There were severe feeding problems and a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube was needed. There was an evolution to a proximal and distal amyotrophy
and a spastic quadriparesis. All this suggests a clinical evolution toward a complicated
form of HSP with involvement of the lower motor neuron and a more severe ALS-like
phenotype. However, fasciculations were seen at that time and no ENMG was performed at
that stage, which could have supported the diagnosis of ALS.

SPG11 pathology includes abnormal aggregation and lipid storage
Lipofuscin-positive granules were abnormally abundant in supratentorial neurons of our
SPG11 patients and in the anterior horn associated with granular osmiophilic amorphous
aggregates. Interestingly, granular intracytoplasmic eosinophilic/PAS+ structures were
exclusively found in motor neurons in spinal cord and hypoglossal nucleus. All these
deposits were restricted to neurons and were labelled with anti-cathepsin-D as
lysosomal-like structures in supratentorial areas, and by anti-ubiquitin and anti-p62 in
spinal cord neurons and ganglion cells. Although we showed, by electron microscopy,
unusual fibrillary filaments intermingled with lipofuscin deposits, no relationship could
be established with the immunostained inclusions in the absence of immuno-electron
microscopy.

The abundance of pigment granules in neurons seems to represent a cytopathological
hallmark of SPG11. Recent studies showed that SPG11 and SPG15 proteins interact with the
late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor protein complex AP-5 (Hirst et al., 2013) and their involvement in
this pathway is consistent with the abnormal lysosomal storage evidenced in fibroblasts
from SPG11, SPG15 and SPG48 patients (Renvoisé et al., 20014; Hirst et al., 2015). Very
recently, an Spg11 knockout mouse model was reported to recapitulate the
major clinical features of the human disease (Varga
et al., 2015). Briefly, the Spg11 knockout
mice developed symptoms reminiscent to spastic paraplegia with progressive loss of
cortical motor neurons and Purkinje cells, as we observed in the human pathology (present
study). Degenerating neurons accumulated autofluorescent material, which was dark and
osmiophilic at the electron microscopy level, consistent with the accumulations observed
in our human brain samples. The neuronal inclusions in the knockout mouse model were
partially immunostained with anti-p62 and with the anti-lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1,
supporting the observation of lysosome/autophagy defects. In addition, morphological
analysis of neurons from Spg15 knockout mice also showed accumulation of
large intraneuronal deposits of membrane-surrounded material, which co-stained with the
lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Khundadze et
al., 2013). Although differences exist between human and mouse brains,
the aformentioned observations indicate that the invalidation of Spg11 in
the mouse mimics the pathology we observed in SPG11 patients and this is relevant for
future studies aimed at identifying potential therapeutic avenues.

Taken together, these results argue in favour of a lysosomal impairment in SPG11 and
SPG15. The abnormal deposits observed in our SPG11 cases are also reminiscent of other
pathological hallmarks of motor neuron diseases associated with mutations in other genes.
Motor neuron inclusions (e.g. granular lesions, ubiquitin, TDP-43, and/or p62 positive
structures) may represent a pivotal feature of these diseases. TDP-43 accumulation is
observed in patients with mutations in GRN (progranulin),
C9orf72, DCTN1 (dynactin), OPTN
(optineurin), VCP (valosin-containing protein),
ANG (angiogenin) (Da Cruz and
Cleveland, 2011), but not in our SPG11 cases. On the other hand, TDP-43
proteinopathy with widespread spinal cord and cerebral skein-like and round neuronal
cytoplasmic inclusions has recently been observed in patients with NIPA1
(SPG6) mutation associated with ALS clinical features (Martinez-Lage et al., 2012). Regarding p62
deposits, the evidence of their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases is growing
(Zatloukal et al., 2002).
The p62 protein, after mono- or poly-ubiquitination, is associated with autophagy (Rubinsztein et al., 2012). The
cytological association between LC3 and p62 markers in neuronal inclusions may indicate
autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins. Inhibition of autophagy and increasing
levels of p62 are generally correlated and p62 itself is degraded by autophagy (Zatloukal et al., 2002; Sasaki, 2011; Martinez-Lage et al., 2012). In Lewy body
disease, it was shown that p62 deposition precedes ubiquitination (Kuusisto et al., 2003) but p62, ubiquitin and
TDP-43 deposition kinetics remains unknown; further biochemical studies and cellular and
animal model analyses are needed to elucidate these kinetics. In our SPG11 patients, the
deposition of p62 and ubiquitination were only observed in subtentorial neurons and dorsal
root ganglia. The differences in composition of the aggregates according to neuronal
populations remain unanswered and we can hypothesize that the immunohistochemical
discrepancy between p62 and TDP-43 deposits observed in the present SPG11 cases and as
reported by others (King et al.,
2011) could be explained by two different hypotheses. Different kinetics of
deposition of these proteins may vary according to the subpopulations of neurons.
Alternatively, SPG11 could represent a subtype of motor neuron pathology in which TDP-43
does not aggregate, as it has been observed in the human pathology and in a mouse model of
ALS/frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to multivesicular body protein
(CHMP2B) gene mutation (Ghazi-Noori et al., 2012).

In conclusion, this study, performed in two distinct sibships, is the first report of
brain and spinal cord autopsy in complex forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia with
SPG11 mutations. We demonstrate the neuropathological link between HSP
and ALS in terms of neurodegeneration topology and show for the first time the existence
of abnormal accumulations in neurons of SPG11, a disorder that can then be added to the
growing list of diseases associated with aggregates. Further studies, using animal and
cellular models may determine if the aggregation of proteins and lysosomal abnormalities
with abnormal lipidic deposits may precede axonal dying back, which was proposed as a
pathological mechanism associated with HSP (Behan
and Maia 1974; Deluca et
al., 2004).
