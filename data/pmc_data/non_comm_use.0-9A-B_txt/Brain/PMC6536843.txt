In the original version of this article, Fig. 4 contained incorrect versions of the heat map and IL-10 ratio graph in panel C; this has now been corrected. The authors apologise for this mistake.


Figure 4 
Analysis of the cytokine production of CCR9+ CD4+ memory T cells. (A) Cytokine production from CCR9+ (9+) or CCR9− (9−) CD4+ T cells in healthy controls (HC) were measured (mean and SEM). *P < 0.05, n.s. (not significant) by Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-sided). (B) CCR9+ or CCR9− Tm cells were analysed from 11 healthy controls, six RRMS, six SPMS, and five elderly healthy control subjects among Supplementary Table 2, and cell proliferation was analysed by incorporating 3H-thymidine (c.p.m.) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Ratios were calculated by (c.p.m of CCR9+ Tm cells)/(c.p.m. of CCR9− Tm cells). Box and whiskers are shown. Whiskers are drawn between 2.5–97th percentile. Not significant (n.s.) by one-way ANOVA. (C) Ratio of the cytokine production levels from 9+ to 9− CD4+ T cells (9+/9−) were calculated in each healthy control, RRMS, SPMS, and elderly healthy control sample from Supplementary Table 2. Outliers are determined by ROUT analysis and removed. Mean ratios are represented in a heatmap and dot plots of the 9+/9− ratio of some of the cytokines evaluated are displayed below (mean and SEM). *P < 0.01 by two-way ANOVA. #P < 0.1, ##P < 0.05 by Tukey’s multiple comparison post-tests.
