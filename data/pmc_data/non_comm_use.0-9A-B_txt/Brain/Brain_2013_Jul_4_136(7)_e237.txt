==== Body
Sir, Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common inherited optic neuropathy
seen in clinical practice, and in >60% of cases, the underlying genetic defect is a
pathogenic mutation within the OPA1 gene (Ferre et al., 2009; Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2010a). The
pathological hallmark of this disorder is the preferential loss of retinal ganglion cells and
patients typically present with bilateral symmetrical visual loss, which progresses
insidiously from early childhood onwards (Fraser
et al., 2010; Yu-Wai-Man
et al., 2011b). Although optic atrophy remains
the defining feature of DOA, recent reports published in Brain have
highlighted the much broader phenotypic manifestations that can result from pathogenic
OPA1 mutations (Amati-Bonneau
et al., 2008; Hudson
et al., 2008). In a multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45
independent OPA1-positive families, we found that up to 20% of
mutation carriers developed significant neurological deficits in addition to visual failure
(Yu-Wai-Man et al.,
2010b). A striking observation in this clinical subgroup was the
high prevalence of sensorineural deafness, which affected nearly two-thirds of all patients
with DOA phenotypes. In their Letter to the Editor, Leruez et al. (2012) have provided confirmatory information on the
interesting association between OPA1 mutations and sensorineural deafness by
reviewing the case records of 1380 patients with suspected inherited optic neuropathy referred
to their laboratory services for molecular genetic testing. Out of 327 patients found to
harbour a pathogenic OPA1 mutation, 21 (6.4%) suffered from
significant hearing impairment, a higher prevalence figure when compared with an age-matched
normal population cohort. The causal link between OPA1 mutations and hearing
loss has also been strengthened further by the findings of an article currently in press in
Brain, describing a new mouse model of DOA harbouring the OPA1delTTAG
mutation (Sarzi et al., 2012).
Heterozygous mutant mice exhibited a progressive and severe form of deafness that became
apparent at the relatively early age of 5 months.

According to Leruez et al.
(2012), among those patients who could pinpoint the actual onset of their visual
symptoms, 54% of them became aware of their hearing problems before the occurrence of
visual loss. However, a slight note of caution is required when drawing conclusions about the
chronology of these clinical features, especially when relying on retrospective patient
account. A few points need to be considered, namely (i) the inherent difficulties in reliably
ascribing a definite age of onset, for example, affected individuals with only mildly reduced
visual acuities are not infrequently asymptomatic; (ii) the application of high-resolution
optical coherence tomography imaging can reveal subclinical retinal ganglion cell loss among
carriers thought to be non-penetrant because of normal visual parameters (Barboni et al., 2011; Yu-Wai-Man et al.,
2011a); and (iii) there is some evidence that the size of the optic
disc is smaller among patients harbouring OPA1 mutations compared with
controls, this structural difference being possibly related to apoptotic retinal ganglion cell
death in utero (Barboni et
al., 2010; Milea et
al., 2010). The evidence so far therefore points to an ongoing process of
accelerated retinal ganglion cell loss starting in early embryonic development and several
years before the subjective appreciation of subnormal visual function.

Leruez et al. (2012) raise an
important practical point whether all OPA1 carriers should undergo a formal
hearing assessment. Based on the prevalence of hearing impairment in their unselected patient
cohort and our own experience, such an approach is neither likely to be cost-effective nor is
it clinically justified in the absence of overt hearing difficulties. As part of genetic
counselling, OPA1 carriers should be informed about the possible development
of extra-ocular neurological complications, including sensorineural deafness, and clinicians
overseeing their care need to be vigilant about the need for timely investigations. Although
the evidence is limited to a handful of cases, patients with hearing loss secondary to
OPA1 mutations do seem to benefit from cochlear implants, the electrical
stimulation of the proximal myelinated portions of auditory nerve proving sufficient to
restore hearing potential (Huang et
al., 2009).

What further molecular insight can we gain from the data set provided by Leruez et
al. (2013)? Similar to our own earlier observation (Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2010b), their
study has confirmed an intriguing predilection of the c.1334G>A (p.Arg445His) mutation for
the inner ear and the unmyelinated portion of the auditory nerve. In their case series, this
specific OPA1 variant accounted for 10 of 21 (47%) patients with
sensorineural deafness. It is also revealing that the majority of OPA1
mutations associated with hearing loss, including c.1334G>A (p.Arg445His), were missense
mutations affecting the GTPase domain of the protein. This specific genotype effectively
conferred a 3-fold increased risk compared with other mutation subgroups (Leruez et al., 2012). Although the
disease mechanisms underpinning this excess attributable risk remain to be clarified, the most
attractive hypothesis is a dominant negative effect linked to an aberrantly modified protein
structure within the critical catalytic GTPase domain.

It is now abundantly clear that OPA1 mutations need to be considered by
neurologists and ophthalmologists for a more heterogeneous category of clinical presentations,
rather than just ‘autosomal DOA’. The broad intra- and inter-familial variability
observed in OPA1 disease only serves to encapsulate several fundamental
questions relating to tissue specificity, secondary genetic modifiers and possible
environmental influences—all of which need to be addressed if we are to make significant
therapeutic inroads, not only for DOA, but for other multi-systemic nuclear mitochondrial
disorders.
