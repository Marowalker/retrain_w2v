transmission success. Within-host clonal antigenic variation helps to maintain
long infectious periods, whereas high levels of allelic diversity at the
population level significantly expand the pool of susceptible individuals.
Diversity, however, is not necessarily a static property of a pathogen
population but in many cases is generated by the very act of infection and
transmission, and it is therefore expected to respond dynamically to changes in
transmission and immune selection. We hypothesized that this coupling creates a
positive feedback whereby infection and disease transmission promote the
generation of diversity, which itself facilitates immune evasion and further
infections. To investigate this link in more detail, we considered the human
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, one of the most
important antigenically diverse pathogens. We developed an individual-based
model in which antigenic diversity emerges as a dynamic property from the
underlying transmission processes. Our results show that the balance between
stochastic extinction and the generation of new antigenic variants is
intrinsically linked to within-host and between-host immune selection. This in
turn determines the level of diversity that can be maintained in a given
population. Furthermore, the transmission-diversity feedback can lead to
temporal lags in the response to natural or intervention-induced perturbations
in transmission rates. Our results therefore have important implications for
monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of disease control efforts.

Introduction
Many pathogens have evolved to optimize their transmission potential by
evading host immune responses. One of the most common immune evasion strategies is
the exploitation of allelic polymorphisms at key antigenic sites that renders
acquired responses from previous encounters ineffective. Antigenic diversity can
play a key role both at the within-host level, where it helps to prolong infectious
periods, and at the population level, where it facilitates reinfection of hosts with
preexisting immunity.

Within-host antigenic diversity, whereby the expression of prominent immune
targets are altered over the course of a single infection, results in repeated
immune escape and enhances the pathogen’s chance of transmission to another
host. The molecular mechanism underlying the generation of within-host diversity
range from error-prone replication, as in the case of human immunodeficiency virus
(McMichael and Phillips 1997), to more
sophisticated strategies involving programmed and reversible switches in antigen
expression. The latter is often referred to as clonal antigenic variation and is
found in many pathogens transmitted by insect vectors or through sexual contact,
where onward transmission is more uncertain and can be interrupted for long periods
of time (reviewed in Barbour and Restrepo
2000; Deitsch et al. 2009). These
pathogens include the sleeping sickness–causing African trypanosomes (Borst and Rudenko 1994), the sexually
transmitted bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Hill and Davies 2009), and the causative agent of Lyme disease,
Borrelia burgdorferi (Barbour
1991).

Antigenic variability at the population level has an equally beneficial
effect on disease transmission by allowing the parasite to infect hosts with
previous exposure to the same pathogen but in an antigenically distinct form. In
contrast to many childhood diseases, such as measles, where recovered individuals
remain protected against reinfection for life, antigenically diverse pathogens can
infect the same host multiple times, often with little or no fitness effect on
subsequently infecting parasites. Pathogens may differ greatly with regard to the
extent of antigenic diversity at any one point in time and space, ranging from the
cocirculation of multiple serotypes, as in the cases of rotavirus (Santos and Hoshino 2005) and Neisseria
meningitidis (Tondella et al.
2000), to the seasonal replacement of dominant strains, as observed for
influenza A virus (Russell et al. 2008).
However, the consequences in terms of expanding the pool of susceptible hosts are
equivalent, and it is this ability to circumvent herd immunity that poses a
considerable challenge for the development of effective vaccines.

The mechanisms underlying antigenic diversification at the population level,
including mutation, recombination, and phase variation, are similar to the ones
underlying within-host variability. In fact, it is often the within-host processes
that generate and maintain the diversity found at the population level, and many
pathogens can be found to actively exploit diversity at both scales. One of the
best-studied organisms where multiscale antigenic diversity is a key factor
underlying its global success is the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum, which relies on clonal antigenic variation to prolong
infectious periods and thus overcome the uncertainties associated with being vector
transmitted. Transcriptional switches between members of the var
gene family during infection changes the expression of variant surface proteins
PfEMP1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1), which are
targets of adaptive immune responses and important virulence factors (Borst et al. 1995; Craig and Scherf 2001; Peters
et al. 2002; Scherf et al. 2008;
Kirkman and Deitsch 2012). Each parasite
carries a repertoire of around 60 var genes, but there is little
concordance between the repertoires of individual parasites (Barry et al. 2007; Kraemer et
al. 2007; Rask et al. 2010; Tessema et al. 2015). Consequently, numerous
infections and, hence, exposure to a large number of antigenic variants is required
for individuals to acquire protection from symptomatic and life-threatening disease
(Bull et al. 1998; Reyburn et al. 2005; Langhorne
et al. 2008; Chan et al.
2012).

The diversity of var genes and var gene
repertoires is mainly generated by frequent intra- and intergenic recombination
events, respectively (Conway et al. 1999;
Freitas-Junior et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 2000; Bopp et al. 2013; Claessens et
al. 2014). Mitotic recombination between individual var
genes during asexual replication in the blood has the potential to generate new
var gene variants. These might not necessarily contribute
directly to within-host immune evasion, as seen in other antigenically variable
parasites, such as trypanosomes or Babesia (Barbour and Restrepo 2000; Deitsch et al. 2009), but may be passed on as part of the genomic
var gene repertoire during transmission. Meiotic recombination,
on the other hand, occurs during sexual replication inside the mosquito vector and
operates at the genome level, where it is responsible for the creation of new
var gene repertoires when mosquitoes are infected by more than
one parasite genotype. Importantly, the probability of this happening is itself
related to population-level prevalence and diversity. This is because hosts are more
likely to carry multiclonal infections (Vafa et al.
2008; Gatei et al. 2015) and be
infected by parasites with different antigenic repertoires (Chen et al. 2011) when prevalence and diversity are high.

The link between within-host and between-host diversity and their role in
immune evasion has important but often overlooked consequences for the epidemiology
of antigenically diverse pathogens. Specifically, for pathogens where infection and
transmission events generate novel antigenic variants, such as P.
falciparum, we would expect that diversity and disease prevalence are
coupled via a positive feedback mechanism, with an increase in one leading to a
subsequent increase in the other. This has not yet been explored in detail,
however.

To investigate this proposed feedback between diversity and infection
prevalence, we developed an individual-based model in which diversity is explicitly
generated through processes underlying infection and is allowed to respond
dynamically to changes in disease transmission. Using P. falciparum
as a model system, we demonstrate how this transmission-diversity feedback can
introduce temporal lags in the system’s response to environmental or
control-induced external perturbations, with potential implications for the
assessment of intervention measures.

Methods
We developed a stochastic individual-based transmission model of
Plasmodium falciparum, explicitly accounting for host and
mosquito demographics, parasite diversity, and infection and transmission
events.

Mosquito Demographics
Mosquitoes are modeled individually and can be uninfected, exposed, or
infectious. Mosquitoes are assumed to die only of natural causes and are
immediately replaced with new uninfected individuals to maintain a constant
population. The age-related probability of death is modeled using a logistic
function:  (1) pdeath(Tm)=0.251+e−0.5(Tm−μm),  where μm = 32
days is the average lifespan and Tm is the
mosquito’s age in days.

Host Demographics
Human hosts are modeled individually, and host demographic processes are
modeled by assuming a daily probability of death, given as  (2) pdeath(Th)=e−λTh−1,  where λ =
−1.5e−6, corresponding to a mean
life expectancy of 55 years, and Th is the host age
in years (i.e., we assume a constant probability of death over the course of a
year). We did not account for maternal protection and assumed that on death
individuals are immediately replaced by an immunologically naive newborn to
maintain a constant population.

Antigen Representation and Parasite Strains
Each parasite carries a repertoire of 60 distinct antigen variants. The
antigens themselves are encoded by a 32-bit binary number, which we refer to as
the antigen’s sequence type (st), where the leading
(leftmost) 32 – k bits of this sequence determine the
(immunologically defined) antigen type (a). This distinction
between sequence type and antigen type allows us to consider cases where two
different sequence types encode the same antigen type, in line with the fact
that not every nucleotide change results in an antigenic change. The antigen
type is calculated as  (3) a=⌊st2k⌋modA,  where A =
232–k defines the size of the total
antigenic space.

Within this framework, we define a parasite strain s by its
antigen repertoire, where two parasites are considered different strains if
their repertoires differ by at least one antigen, defined by its antigen type.
Mathematically we can represent s as an
A-dimensional vector containing 0s and 1s, where each element
sa indicates the presence
(sa = 1) or absence
(sa = 0) of antigen a.

An example 16-bit antigen representation with k = 6 is
visualized in figure 1, in which the
antigen-encoding bits are shaded in blue.

Transmission and Infection
Mosquitoes are assumed to bite humans at a constant rate,
b. When an infectious mosquito bites a host, it transmits
the infection with probability ptrans unless the
host already has immunity to all of the infecting strain’s
(s) antigenic variants or is at its maximum capacity for
concurrent infections (see below). On infection the parasite will try to express
its antigenic repertoire over the course of the infection by means of clonal
antigenic variation. The within-host infection dynamics are not explicitly
modeled here; instead, we calculate the duration of the infection as a function
of the number of novel antigenic variants the parasite presents to the host
(Holding and Recker 2015), given as
 (4) ω(h,s)=α<1−h,s>,  where α is the maximal
contribution to the infection length by a novel antigen (i.e., an antigen to
which the host has no immunity to). The term h =
{h1, h2, … ,
hA} is the host’s immune status
vector (with respect to all possible variants a ∈
A), where ha represents the
degree of protection against antigen type a, with
ha = 1 corresponding to complete immunity to
antigen a and ha = 0 corresponding
to complete susceptibility. Therefore, if the host has no immunity to any of the
infecting parasite’s antigen repertoire, the infection length will be
60α, whereas this would be reduced to
α∑a(1 –
ha) if the host has already been exposed to
a subset of the antigens.

As we are not explicitly modeling the within-host dynamics, infected
humans are assumed to be equally infectious over the course of the infection.
The intrinsic incubation period in the human host is not expected to have any
influence on the system’s dynamics (as it is very small compared with the
average human life expectancy), and we therefore assumed that humans become
infectious at the onset of an infection. If a susceptible mosquito bites an
infectious host, it will become infected with probability
ptrans and infectious after an extrinsic
incubation period of L = 10 days. If the host is infected by
more than one strain, the mosquito will become infected with a recombinant
strain (see below).

For computational simplicity, we limited the number of concurrent
infections to two. Although the multiplicity of infection can easily exceed this
limit, especially in regions of high transmission intensities, this is the
simplest setup that facilitates meiotic recombination in the mosquito following
a bloodmeal on a coinfected host. Mosquitoes are limited to one infection, and
once infected they are assumed to stay infected with that strain for life.

Immunity
By default we assumed that immunity is strictly variant specific and is
the result of the parasite expressing its antigenic repertoire—or rather
the subset that the host has not yet seen—over the course of an
infection. We make the simplifying assumption that on infection the
host’s immune status changes immediately to reflect exposure to all
antigens of the infecting strain’s repertoire. Hence, the success of
subsequent infections is subject to these changes even if a host has not yet
cleared the ongoing infection.

In addition to variant-specific immunity, we also considered that
exposure to variant a can induce cross protection against
other, antigenically similar variants, where the degree of protection decays
with distance in antigen space from a. We implemented
cross-immunity by an additive transformation of the immune status vector,
h, using a Gaussian distribution with the mean corresponding to
the antigen type and the strength of cross-immunity determined by the variance.
The change in the immune status with exposure to antigen a can
then be calculated by  (5) Δhi,a=exp(−(i−a)22γ)fori∈{1,2,…,A},  where γ controls the
strength of cross-immunity. For computational simplicity, we truncated the tails
of the Gaussian distribution to zero where
Δhi,a
< 0.01.

Recombination
We considered diversity generation through recombination at both the
gene level and the genome level. For sexual recombination, we assumed that two
strains picked up by the mosquito from a multiclonal infection give rise to a
single recombinant strain that infects the mosquito. Meiotic recombination thus
takes place in our model at the moment of feeding, and this avoids modeling the
dynamics of multiple strains within the mosquito. This also allows us to
simplify mosquito infections to a single strain while still modeling the
generation of new antigen repertoires and the flow of genes between strains. An
important consequence of this is that it assumes that meiotic recombination can
occur only between strains taken up from the same host rather than from multiple
feeds from different hosts. This may thus underestimate diversity generation in
our model, especially in combination with our restriction to two concurrent
infections.

During meiotic recombination, the antigen repertoire of the recombinant
strain is generated from the parental repertoires in a genewise manner by
probability ps. That is, we assumed that a gene can
be taken from either parent strain in an independent manner. Although this might
not be the most biologically realistic assumption and ignores any intragenomic
structuring (e.g., by means of chromosomal location and upstream promoters), it
maximizes the generation of new repertoires.

Mitotic recombination between individual genes is assumed to occur
during asexual reproduction in the host (Bopp et
al. 2013; Claessens et al.
2014). This involves recombination between two genes within the same
antigen repertoire and in the model leads to the replacement of one of these
genes with a gene encoding the recombinant antigen, leaving all other genes
unmodified. It is expected that parasites carrying a novel gene resulting from
mitotic recombination make up only a small fraction of parasite population in
the host and that the magnitude of (antigenic) change is too small to have any
bearing on an ongoing infection. Additionally, we expect the probability of
mosquitoes picking up these parasites to be much lower than the more numerous
original clone. For computational reasons, we do not compute this at the
within-host level. Instead, we assumed that a recombinant gene is copied to the
transmitted strain with a small per-gene probability,
pc, which incorporates the probability that a
recombinant parasite is taken up during the blood meal as well as the rate of
intragenic (mitotic) recombination.

Mitotic recombination is implemented by adding a number,
r, to the original antigen representation, where
r is proportional to the difference between the original
and donor antigens, given as  (6) r=κθ(ai−aj),  where κ is a random
number drawn from a uniform distribution 𝒰(−1,
1), θ scales the magnitude of change, and
ai and aj are
the original and donor antigen types, respectively. The new recombinant gene is
then represented as  (7) gi*=gi+r,  where gi is the full
sequence type representation (not antigen type) of the parent antigen.

This scheme avoids having to simulate low-level biological mechanisms
such as insertion and deletion of domains or nucleotide sequences between genes,
leading to a computationally efficient model that emulates the main features of
recombination: (i) recombination between antigenically similar donor genes is
likely to produce recombinant genes that are similar to the donor genes, (ii)
recombination between antigenically dissimilar genes more likely results in a
recombinant antigen that differs from the original genes, and (iii)
recombination events alter the sequence type but not necessarily the antigenic
type, although these silent changes can accumulate over time and can eventually
lead to changes in the antigen type.

Initialization
The model was initialized with both human and mosquito populations at a
demographic equilibrium. A small number of mosquitoes were initialized as
infected, while all humans were initialized as naive (i.e., with no prior
exposure). As a result, a burn-in period was required to allow the system to
reach a dynamic equilibrium. We generated an initial pool of antigens of size
Ainit from a uniform distribution over the
entire sequence type space. Next we generated Sinit
strains by randomly sampling from the antigen pool without replacement (or with
replacement in cases where Ainit <
Sinit), which were then used to infect
mosquitoes, such that an approximately equal number of mosquitoes were infected
by each initial strain.

Table 1 summarizes the main
parameters and parameter ranges used in our model. Throughout we use the
baseline values for each parameter (as indicated in table 1) unless otherwise specified.

The model was implemented in C++ and is provided in a zip file,
available online.1

Results
We investigated the effect of antigenic diversity on malaria transmission
and prevalence by means of a stochastic individual-based model in which antigen
variants are dynamically generated through recombination and in which the diversity
of the parasite population emerges from the underlying transmission dynamics (see
“Methods”). To highlight how
population-level prevalence and transmission rates are related to parasite
diversity, we first show the model behavior assuming static levels of antigenic
diversity—that is, without accounting for recombination—before
investigating the dynamical feedback between parasite antigenic diversity and
malaria epidemiology.

Static Diversity
First we considered the situation in which diversity is static, that is,
with mitotic and meiotic recombination turned off. Strains were initialized by
randomly selecting antigens without replacement to ensure that there is no
overlap between repertoires. This allowed us to assess the general effect of
diversity without the added complications of immune interactions. Without the
possibility of new variants entering the population, the model converged toward
an equilibrium-like state dictated by the background transmission rate, here
quantified as the daily biting rate, and the total level of diversity among the
parasite population (fig.
2A). With no mechanism for the generation of new
antigen variants, diversity decreased over time because parasite strains were
subject to stochastic extinction. In fact, in each model run we observed that
only a certain proportion of the initial set of variants was maintained over a
given period of time. We therefore describe this state as a semiequilibrium
because epidemiological processes are at equilibrium with respect to
transmission but stochastic extinction means that diversity is slowly lost from
the system over time. The size of the host population is thus a crucial factor
influencing the relationship between malaria prevalence and parasite diversity.
Larger populations are known to be able to maintain higher degrees of diversity,
and we see the same phenomenon in our model. That is, we found a strong positive
correlation between host population size and the proportion of initial antigens
retained and, hence, an overall increase in prevalence (fig. 2B).

As expected, for a given number of antigenic variants that cocirculate
in the population there is a positive but nonlinear relationship between
mosquito biting rate and population-level parasite prevalence, here defined as
the proportion of the population that is currently infected. After an initial
steep increase in prevalence with increasing rates of transmission, the
relationship plateaus, up to a point where increases in transmission do not
raise parasite prevalence any further (fig.
2C). This scenario, which we refer to as
“transmission saturated,” occurs as hosts acquire immunity to the
vast majority of the antigenic variants available in the population. Therefore,
the attained equilibrium rate in prevalence is strongly dependent on antigenic
diversity, with higher levels of diversity enabling the parasites to more
readily find susceptible hosts, leading to a higher proportion of infected
individuals (fig. 2C).

A similar relationship is also found between antigenic diversity and
parasite prevalence, with increasing levels of diversity leading to an increase
in prevalence, at least up to a point where further diversification does not
affect prevalence any more. This scenario, here referred to as “diversity
saturation,” occurs when the number of malaria infections a host acquires
over a lifetime is simply limited by exposure. As a result and pretty much as
expected, higher levels of exposure (i.e., biting rates) will shift the
equilibrium levels of parasite prevalence upward, as shown in figure 2D.

Dynamic Diversity
As shown in figure 2, there is a
strong link between malaria prevalence and parasite antigenic diversity, that
is, the degree to which the parasite can circumvent immune responses and
establish infections even in preexposed and semi-immune individuals. In the
examples shown above it was assumed that diversity was an initially fixed but
slowly declining quantity. In reality, however, antigenic diversity in
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the result of dynamic
processes, predominantly recombination, whose rates are determined by
epidemiological parameters related to transmission and prevalence.

To demonstrate the effect of considering diversity as a dynamic
property, we ran our model without recombination for a number of years until it
reached a dynamic equilibrium state before turning recombination on. As
illustrated in figure 3, allowing new
variants and parasite strains to be generated over time leads to a significant
increase in overall diversity, here defined as the proportion of all possible
antigenic variants, A (fig.
3A). This increase in diversity effectively
reduces population-level immunity, as hosts will not have experienced the newly
generated variants before (fig.
3B). As a result, parasites are more likely to
find susceptible hosts, leading to an increase in parasite prevalence (fig. 3B) and, hence, disease
transmission (here measured by the entomological inoculation rate [EIR], shown
in fig. 3D), even without
changes to the transmission potential through biting rates. Not surprisingly, we
found a strong correlation between the recombination rate and the
system’s response with regard to these epidemiological determinants.

Figure 3 demonstrates the positive
feedback between parasite antigenic diversity and disease prevalence in the
population. What is apparent is that this process is bounded in that the system
will settle into a new equilibrium balanced between diversity generation,
determined by recombination and background transmission rates, and diversity
loss, due to demographic and immune selection–associated risk of
extinction. It is interesting to note that diversity reaches an equilibrium
after prevalence plateaus. This is because despite being linked through a
positive feedback mechanism, diversity and prevalence are limited by different
factors. Diversity is limited by the ability of the parasite population to
retain antigenic variants, which itself depends on the parasite population size
and, hence, prevalence. Prevalence, on the other hand, can be limited by either
transmission (diversity saturation; fig.
2D) or diversity (transmission saturation; fig. 2C). As the parasite
population diversifies, the system transitions into a diversity-saturated state,
causing prevalence (and parasite population size) to plateau while diversity can
still increase toward its maximum.

Immune selection in particular has a strong and expected effect on both
antigenic diversity and parasite prevalence. That is, theoretical models have
repeatedly shown how cross-immunity can structure antigenically variable
pathogen populations into sets of strains with nonoverlapping antigenic
repertoires (Gupta et al. 1996; Gupta and Anderson 1999), although
different population structures can also emerge depending on the degree of
cross-immunity and assumptions regarding transmission and recombination (Artzy-Randrup et al. 2012). In our model,
increasing the degree of cross-immunity that a variant antigen elicits against
antigenically similar variants enhances the selection pressure on the pathogen
to find susceptible hosts, leading to an increased risk of extinction and thus a
decrease in overall diversity and parasite prevalence. This is demonstrated in
figure 4, where we simulated our model
using the same assumption about transmission and recombination under increasing
immune-selection pressure (degree of cross-immunity,
γ).

Diversity and Prevalence under Changing Transmission Rates
As diversity and prevalence are coupled dynamically and are partially
determined by the transmission potential in terms of mosquito biting rate, we
hypothesized that there must be a lag in the system’s response to
temporal changes in disease transmission, which could be caused by changes in
mosquito population density or bed net usage. We analyzed this by increasing or
decreasing the biting rate over a period of 4 years and recorded the resulting
response in antigenic diversity (fig.
5A, 5C) and parasite prevalence
(fig. 5B,
5D) over time.

In cases of both increasing and decreasing transmission potential the
model showed a predictable response, with higher transmission rates leading to
higher levels of diversity and prevalence rates and vice versa. However, in
particular in those cases where we simulated an increase in transmission (fig. 5A,
5B), we also observed a certain inertia where both
diversity and prevalence kept increasing for many years despite no further
changes to the biting rate. This can be explained by the positive feedback loop
between diversity and prevalence, where a change in one property has a delayed
downstream effect. Interestingly, though, we found that the system would
generally respond quicker to decreases in transmission, although even in those
cases it took many years for the system to attain a new state of equilibrium. An
explanation for this is that because of high selection pressure it is easier for
antigenic variants to become extinct than for new variants to be generated and
become established in the population.

The system’s intrinsic inertia also leads to the phenomenon of
hysteresis, where different rates of transmission can have very different
outcomes in terms of diversity and prevalence, depending on whether there has
been an increase or a decrease in the biting rate. This is shown in figure 5E and figure
5F, which depict the levels of diversity and
parasite prevalence during the transition from low to high (blue lines) followed
by high to low (red lines) mosquito biting rates for 100 repeat simulations.
What is clear from these graphs is that the relationship between malaria
prevalence and other external factors that could influence its transmission
potential is highly nonlinear and time lagged to the point where observed
changes in malaria incidence, for example, could be due to changes in mosquito
abundance that had happened a considerable period of time in the past.

Discussion
Here we analyzed the diversity-transmission feedback and its implication for
the epidemiological dynamics of antigenically diverse pathogens. Using an
evolutionary framework in which diversity is an emergent property of the dynamic
processes underlying infection and transmission events, we have demonstrated how
population-level parasite prevalence and incidence are intrinsically linked via
diversity, and how this can create temporal lags in how the system reacts to
perturbations in disease transmission rates. Although we concentrated our analysis
on the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, our results
should be broadly applicable to other multistrain disease systems where novel
antigenic variants can be readily generated through processes related to infection
and transmission and where variants might equally be lost from the population
through stochastic extinction. For those systems, we would then expect to find a
nonlinear and time-varying relationship among incidence, prevalence, and the
pathogen’s transmission potential, implying that diversity needs to be
considered explicitly in theoretical approaches trying to elucidate this
relationship from empirical data.

For P. falciparum malaria, epidemiological studies have
revealed a strong nonlinear relationship between transmission intensity, determined
by means of the EIR, and parasite prevalence, which increases steeply under low to
medium transmission levels but then plateaus in more intense transmission settings
(Beier et al. 1999; Smith et al. 2005; Okello et
al. 2006). Mathematical models trying to elucidate this relationship have
often focused on the slow acquisition of immunity without explicitly taking
diversity into consideration. In those frameworks, it is simply the notion that
higher prevalence leads to higher infection rates that can generate the observed
relationship under the assumption that hosts require a sufficiently high number of
infections to become immune (see, e.g., Dietz et al.
1974; Molineaux 1985; Killeen et al. 2000; Gu et al. 2003; Smith et al.
2006, 2008; Mandal et al. 2011). An obvious limitation of these approaches
is their inability to consider the effect of diversity on immune acquisition,
effectively treating all epidemiological settings similarly.

Here we considered an alternative formulation of immunity that explicitly
depends on the host’s exposure to the parasite’s variant antigens.
Importantly, this formulation relaxes previous assumptions about the number of
infections required for a host to acquire immunity, which in our model arises
naturally through the interplay of antigenic diversity and transmission intensity.
In fact, the central aspect of our model was to consider antigenic diversity not as
a static quantity but rather as a dynamic property of the system that is regulated
through multiscale processes related to infection, transmission, and immunity. That
is, we considered these processes linked by a positive feedback loop. Under this
assumption, novel antigenic variants can be generated through mitotic recombination
during infections. These new variants, if transmitted, are disseminated throughout
the parasite population by means of meiotic recombination, which we assumed acts
only at the repertoire level. This in turn will help the parasite to circumvent
preexisting immunity and thus facilitate the generation of further diversity.

Importantly, the continuous generation of new antigenic variants does not
result in ever-increasing levels of diversity but is counterbalanced by the loss of
diversity due to stochastic extinction, where small host populations and strong
immune selection pressure significantly increase the risk of parasite strains
becoming extinct. Assuming that recombination rates and immune interference between
antigenic variants (e.g., cross-immunity) are intrinsic properties of the parasite
and the host, our results suggest that each host-pathogen ecosystem will attain its
own state of equilibrium with regard to parasite diversity and population-level
prevalence.

There are various caveats to our model, mostly related to our simplifying
assumptions about how hosts acquire immunity and how antigenic variants and immunity
relate to infection length and thus a strain’s probability of onward
transmission. For the majority of multistrain disease systems very little is known
about how acquired immunity affects the transmission success of subsequent
infections, although a general decrease with repeated exposure would be a reasonable
assumption. In this respect, shortening the infectious period and keeping the
per-bite or per-contact transmission probability constant is akin to lowering the
transmission probability for the same length of infection. Furthermore, adding
cross-protective immunity, where the risk or length of infection decreases as a
function of accumulated exposure or similarity to previously infecting strains, does
not lead to significantly different outcomes. This means that our results are fairly
robust to changes in the underlying assumptions about immunity and should therefore
be applicable to other disease systems.

The feedback between infection and diversity described in this work not only
leads to temporal lags in the responsiveness of the system to changes in the
transmission potential but also introduces a certain degree of inertia. Delays in a
dynamical system’s response to external perturbations are expected; however,
in our case we observed transient behaviors in parasite prevalence and diversity
many years after the assumed changes in mosquito biting rates. In epidemiological
terms, this implies that trying to infer the causative factors of observed changes
in disease incidence might be more complicated than previously appreciated and would
have to take into account potential changes that took place many years in the past.
Together with the possibility that in a given endemic setting the system could be in
a state of transmission saturation, evaluating the effectiveness of control measures
could show significant discrepancies, especially when the evaluation period is too
short for the system to have reached a new endemic equilibrium.

In summary, we have shown that diversity plays a crucial role in the
epidemiology of antigenically diverse pathogens by linking multiscale immune
selection with population-level parasite prevalence and incidence. Our results thus
argue for a renewed effort to understand how acquired immunity to an antigenically
diverse pathogen is shaped by its diversity and how diversity itself is determined
by immunity and immune selection.

Figure 1 Example antigen representation as a 16-bit sequence. A, The
antigen type (a) is determined by the leading 10 bits (shaded
in blue), whereas the sequence type (st) is determined by the
whole 16-bit sequence. The number of bits encoding only sequence type
(k = 6, shaded in gray) determines the number of possible
antigen representations for each antigen type. B, Separating
antigen type and sequence type permits two different genes
(st1 and st2) to
encode the same antigen type. C, A parasite strain is defined
by its repertoire of 60 distinct antigen types.

Figure 2 Relationship between transmission potential, antigenic diversity, and malaria
prevalence. A, Simulated time series showing how malaria
prevalence, defined as the proportion of the population infected by the
parasite, converges toward an endemic equilibrium determined by the daily biting
rate b and antigenic diversity
Sinit. B, Diversity, here
measured as the proportion of initially circulating antigenic variants that are
maintained in a population, is positively correlated with the size of the host
population (assuming equal M:H ratios), which
also affects the equilibrium levels of malaria prevalence. C,
Equilibrium levels of malaria prevalence as a function of the transmission
potential (biting rate) under different levels of antigenic diversity. In all
cases, prevalence plateaus and does not increase further with increasing biting
rates; we refer to this regime as “transmission saturated.”
D, Equilibrium levels of malaria prevalence as a function
of diversity under different levels of transmission, showing a plateauing
behavior where prevalence does not increase any further with increasing levels
of diversity; we refer to this regime as “diversity saturated.”
Results for B–D are based on 10 model
runs, with error bars indicating the SEs around the mean. Parameter values are
as in table 1 unless stated
otherwise.

Figure 3 Diversity as an emergent property of infection and transmission.
A, Allowing for recombination to create new antigenic
variants and antigenic repertoires significantly increases the level of
diversity among the parasite population, here defined as the percentage of the
assumed maximum level of diversity. B, As diversity increases,
host susceptibility increases as parasites carrying novel variants find it
easier to reinfect individuals with prior immunity. C,
Increasing diversity and host susceptibility leads to higher malaria incidence
and population-level prevalence. D, Increasing the number of
infected hosts increases the overall transmission intensity (entomological
inoculation rate [EIR]) even without changes to the biting rate. Different lines
denote different rates of recombination (pc),
showing how higher rates of diversity generation relate positively with parasite
prevalence and disease transmission. Parameters values are as in table 1 unless stated otherwise.

Figure 4 Antigenic diversity and malaria prevalence as a function of immune selection
pressure. Cross-immunity determines the degree of inhibition that each antigenic
variant elicits against antigenically similar variants, such that higher levels
of cross-immunity increases the selection pressure on the parasite population,
which in turn limits the number of variants that can be maintained in a
population (A) and thus decreases the overall level of malaria
prevalence (B). Each point is the average equilibrium level
based on 10 model runs. Parameters values are as in table 1 unless stated otherwise.

Figure 5 Antigenic diversity and malaria prevalence in response to changes in
transmission. As antigenic diversity and parasite prevalence are linked via a
dynamic feedback loop, our model predicts a temporal lag in the response to both
increases (A, B) and decreases
(C, D) in transmission rates (mosquito
biting rate, black dashed lines). The periods over which the biting rate was
changed is highlighted in gray. The system also exhibits a degree of inertia,
with changes in diversity and prevalence taking place many years after the
biting rate has settled onto a new value. The different rates at which the
system responds to changes in the transmission rate can result in different
levels of diversity (E) and prevalence (F),
depending on whether there has been a reduction (red lines) or an increase (blue
lines) in transmission. A–D show the
results of a single model run, and E and F
show the results of 100 model runs, with the bold lines representing the
averages. Parameter values are M = 8,000, H =
8,000, pc = 0.001, Ainit
= 2,400, and Sinit = 40; other parameter values are
as in table 1.
