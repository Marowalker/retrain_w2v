In the isotopologue analysis of glycero(phospho)lipids (Figure 5), the authors mistakenly included glycerolipids with only the glycerol moiety labeled (i.e., m+3) in the Glycerol + Fatty Acid labeling groups (Glycl+FA). Fractional enrichment of 13C into Glycl+FA of panels B−F should include only those glycerolipids having both the glycerol and fatty acyl chains labeled (e.g. this would include m+5, m+7, m+9, m+11, m+13, m+15, etc.). The corrected figure is presented here. These changes do not change the conclusions drawn from the study and do not require modifications to the text of the manuscript.
