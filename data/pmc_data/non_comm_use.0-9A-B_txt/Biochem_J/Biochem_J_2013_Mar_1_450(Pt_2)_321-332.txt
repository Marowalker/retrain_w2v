disulfide-isomerase) localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. ERp27 is predicted to consist of two
thioredoxin-fold domains homologous with the non-catalytic b and b′
domains of PDI. The structure in solution of the N-terminal b-like domain of ERp27 was
solved using high-resolution NMR data. The structure confirms that it has the thioredoxin fold and
that ERp27 is a member of the PDI family. 15N-NMR relaxation data were obtained and
ModelFree analysis highlighted limited exchange contributions and slow internal motions, and
indicated that the domain has an average order parameter S2 of 0.79.
Comparison of the single-domain structure determined in the present study with the equivalent domain
within full-length ERp27, determined independently by X-ray diffraction, indicated very close
agreement. The domain interface inferred from NMR data in solution was much more extensive than that
observed in the X-ray structure, suggesting that the domains flex independently and that
crystallization selects one specific interdomain orientation. This led us to apply a new rapid
method to simulate the flexibility of the full-length protein, establishing that the domains show
considerable freedom to flex (tilt and twist) about the interdomain linker, consistent with the NMR
data.

INTRODUCTION
The lumen of the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) is the subcellular compartment responsible for
folding and quality control of proteins exported to the cell surface or extracellular spaces. This
compartment contains many resident proteins which carry out these folding and quality assurance
functions. One prominent group of such resident proteins is the PDI (protein disulfide-isomerase)
family of proteins [1–3]. There are 20 known members of the human PDI family and their best-known role is in
facilitating formation of the correct pairing of disulfide bonds, a key aspect of the folding
process for most extracellular or cell-surface proteins. Proteins of the PDI family have a range of
functions in addition to disulfide bond isomerization, and not all members of the family are
catalytically active. All proteins of the PDI family have, or are thought to have, at least one
domain with significant structural similarity to Trx (thioredoxin). These Trx-like domains have a
mixed β/α fold with the typical secondary structure topology
β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-β5-α4
[3]. Those proteins which are catalytically active in
disulfide bond isomerization act through a conserved Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys active-site motif in a Trx-like
domain. This motif is located in the N-terminus of α2 and incorporates the loop
immediately preceding this helix. There is typically also a proline residue in the
cis conformation in the loop between α3 and β4.
This loop is adjacent to the active site in the tertiary structure and the
cis-proline residue is thought to play a role in substrate binding [4]. Those members of the PDI family which are not catalytically
active possess at least one Trx-like domain which lacks the active-site motif and may or may not
possess the conserved cis-proline residue.

PDI is composed of four Trx-like domains, a, b, b′
and a′, with an acidic α-helical extension on the C-terminus [2,5]. The a and
a′ domains contain the catalytic sites involved in thiol-disulfide
oxidoreduction and show high sequence similarity to one another and to Trx. The b and
b′ domains are non-catalytic; the b domain is of unknown function,
whereas the b′ domain plays a major role in substrate binding [6]. This domain contains a hydrophobic pocket which is thought to
act as the principal substrate-binding site on the protein [7,8], with the other domains making smaller
contributions to substrate binding.

ERp27 is a 27.7 kDa ER-resident protein of unknown function and a putative member of the
PDI family [9]. On the basis of sequence analysis, ERp27 is
thought to be composed of two non-catalytic PDI-like domains, b and
b′. The protein contains two cysteine residues, one in each domain. These
cysteine residues have been shown to exist as free thiols and to be buried within each domain [9]. The protein is thus unlikely to be involved in thiol-disulfide
oxidoreduction. The C-terminal domain of ERp27 shows sequence similarity to the
b′ domain of PDI, and the similarity includes residues involved in the
substrate-binding site of PDI [7,8], suggesting that ERp27 may possess a similar binding site. Indeed, this domain of
ERp27 has been shown to bind the 14-residue peptide Δ-somatostatin [9]. ERp27 has also been shown to interact with ERp57, another member of the PDI
family, both in vitro and in vivo [9]. The binding site for ERp57 has been mapped to the C-terminal
(b′) domain of ERp27.

In the present paper we describe the solution structure and backbone dynamics of the N-terminal
(b) domain of human ERp27. Structural data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB code 2L4C). NMR relaxation data were collected for this domain, indicating regions of increased
mobility. A comparison of the HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence) spectrum for this
isolated domain and that for full-length ERp27 identified a large contiguous surface on the
b domain affected by connection to the b′ domain. This putative
interface region was considerably more extensive than that found in the X-ray structure of
full-length ERp27 (PDB code 4F9Z, H. Schindelin and F.-X. Kober) and stimulated an exploration of
the flexibility of ERp27 about the interdomain linker. We found that the domains show great
interdomain flexibility making extensive transient interdomain contacts, consistent with the NMR
data. This implies that crystallization selected a specific interdomain orientation from an ensemble
of possible orientations.

EXPERIMENTAL
Protein expression and purification
Mature human ERp27 (Glu26–Leu273) and the individual b
domain (Glu26–Leu141) were expressed in Escherichia
coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells with an N-terminal His tag (MHHHHHHM) as described previously
[9]. 15N- and
15N/13C-labelled protein was expressed in M9 medium containing
[15N]ammonium chloride (1 g/l) or [15N]ammonium chloride (1 g/l)
and [13C]glucose (2 g/l). The recombinant protein was purified by immobilized
metal-affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography. Purified protein was
concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 25 mM monosodium phosphate and 100 mM sodium
chloride (pH 6.5). Sodium azide (0.01%) was added as a preservative.

Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy
Protein samples were prepared to a concentration of 1–1.5 mM for structural
determination experiments and 0.5 mM for relaxation studies in 25 mM monosodium
phosphate and 100 mM sodium chloride (pH 6.5). The samples were placed in 5 mm
Shigemi BMS-005V tubes with 10% 2H2O. All NMR experiments were carried out on
four-channel Varian Unity INOVA NMR spectrometers with 1H resonance frequencies of 600
MHz, at the University of Kent, or 800 MHz at the Medical Research Council National Institute for
Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, U.K. All spectra were acquired at 25°C.
Referencing for the 1H chemical shift was based on the position of the water
1H resonance, according to its known relationship with temperature [10] and 13C/15N referencing was achieved using gamma ratios.
NMR experiments used WATERGATE [11] for solvent suppression
to attenuate the 1H water signal. Indirect dimensions were acquired using the
hypercomplex method [12]. Data were processed on a Linux
platform (SuSe 10.0) using NMRPipe [13], and analysed using
the CcpNmr Analysis package [14].

NMR resonance assignment
1H-15N HSQC, CBCA(CO)NH and CBCANH standard triple-resonance NMR
experiments were used to assign the backbone Cα, Cβ and amide 15N and
1H resonances. 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and HCCH-TOCSY experiments, with mixing
times of 60 ms and 18 ms respectively, were used to assign the aliphatic side-chain
1H and 13C resonances. Where necessary, 3D (three-dimensional) 15N-
and 13C-edited NOESY spectra were used to aid in the assignments. Side-chain
NH2 resonances of asparagine and glutamine were assigned using the
1H-15N HSQC spectrum and a 15N-edited NOESY spectrum. Aromatic
side-chain 1H and 13C resonances were assigned using 2D (two-dimensional)
1H-1H TOCSY with 60 ms mixing time, 2D 1H-1H
NOESY with 100 ms mixing time, 2D aromatic 1H-1H NOESY with
80 ms mixing time and a 2D selective aromatic 1H-13C HSQC spectrum.

15N NMR relaxation measurements
15N T1 and T2 experiments were
acquired using developed pulse sequences comparable with those described elsewhere [15]. T1 and
T2 delay times were set as 128, 256 (×2), 384, 512, 640
(×2), 769 and 897 ms, and 20, 40, 60 (×2), 80, 100, 120 (×2), 140 and
160 ms respectively. 15N Heteronuclear NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) experiments
were collected with a relaxation delay of 5 s with and without saturation of the amide
protons that was achieved using 120° high-power pulses [16]. Relaxation times were calculated as the exponential fit of single exponential decays to
peak intensity values:
I=I0exp(−t/Tx)
where Tx=T1 or
T2, and I=resonance intensity at time
t. Heteronuclear NOEs were calculated using the expression
η=I/I0. ModelFree analysis of the relaxation data was carried out
using the ModelFree 4.0 suite of programs [17–19] to obtain the optimal parameter fits of
S2 (order parameter of motion), τe (internal
correlation time) and Rex (exchange broadening). All ModelFree
optimization used the most appropriate model with the lowest number of parameters possible to
provide an optimal fit to the relaxation data.

Structure calculations
NOE distance restraints were obtained from 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and
13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Both experiments were recorded at 800 MHz with a mixing
time of 80 ms. Dihedral angle (φ/ϕ) restraints were generated from backbone
chemical-shift data using TALOS [20]. Hydrogen-bond donors
were determined from 15N-HSQC experiments involving H/D (hydrogen/deuterium) exchange and
hydrogen bond donor–acceptor pairs within secondary structure elements were identified from
preliminary structure calculations. Structure calculations initially used only NOE restraints and
were refined by subsequent inclusion of the dihedral angle and hydrogen-bond restraints. Structures
were calculated using ARIA version 2.1 [21] and CNS version
1.2 [22]. For assignment of ambiguous NOESY cross-peaks with
ARIA, the frequency window sizes were left at the default settings of 0.02 p.p.m. for direct and
0.04 p.p.m. for indirect proton dimensions, and 0.5 p.p.m. for heteronuclear dimensions. For each
round of structure calculations, ten iterations were performed. For the first iteration, 50
structures were calculated and the 20 lowest-energy structures were used for calibration and
violation analysis. For the next seven iterations, 20 structures were calculated, with the seven
lowest-energy structures used for calibration and violation analysis. For the ninth iteration, 50
structures were calculated and the 20 lowest-energy structures were used for calibration and
violation analysis. For the final (tenth) iteration, 100 structures were calculated. For iterations
0–9, the violation tolerances were set to 1000.0, 5.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.1 0.1, 0.1 and
0.1 Å (1 Å=0.1 nm) respectively and the partial assignment ambiguity cut-off
values were set to 1.0, 0.9999, 0.999, 0.99, 0.98, 0.96, 0.93, 0.9, 0.85 and 0.8 respectively. For
each iteration, the violation threshold was set to 0.5 Å and the maximum number of
contributions for partial assignment was 20. Structure calculations with CNS used torsion angle
dynamics. Each iteration used 18000 cooling steps in the simulated annealing protocol fixed in the
ratio of 5:4 for the first and second cooling stages respectively.

Mapping of the b/b′ domain interface on the b domain of ERp27
Residues from the b domain of ERp27 potentially forming the interface with the
b′ domain were identified using the minimal shift mapping approach [23,24]. Minimal shift
mapping provides a measure of the chemical-shift difference, Δshift, that
corresponds to the minimal, or closest distance, for each b peak to any peak in an
equivalent full-length ERp27 (bb′) spectrum. Therefore a peak in the spectrum of
b with a corresponding peak in bb′ in an identical position would
score a Δshift of zero with the value of Δshift increasing as
the bb′ peak moves further away from being coincident to the b
peak. These changes in chemical shift are indicative of a change in chemical environment in the
full-length protein compared with the single-domain protein. Hence, a comparison of the
15N-HSQC spectra for the b domain and the full-length protein provides
identification of residues with NH chemical shifts that are different in the b
construct compared with the bb′ construct. For each peak in the HSQC spectrum
for the b domain, the combined 1H and 15N chemical-shift
difference was calculated for all peaks in the HSQC spectrum for the full-length protein. The
following equation was used:  Δshift=(Δ1HN)2+(1/6Δ15N)2  where Δ1HN is the chemical-shift difference
in the 1H dimension and Δ15N is the chemical-shift difference in the
15N dimension. The Δ15N shift difference was reduced by a factor of 6
to account for the difference in 15N-HSQC amide chemical-shift ranges of approximately 30
p.p.m. and 5 p.p.m. for 15N and 1H respectively.

Simulation of the flexibility of full-length ERp27
The atomic co-ordinates of full-length ERp27 (PDB code 4F9Z) were kindly provided by F.-X. Kober
and H. Schindelin in advance of publication and were used to simulate and represent the relative
motion of the domains. Simulation was by a novel rapid method which analyses the protein structure
as a network of rigid clusters and flexible linkers using the program FIRST [25], separately calculates the normal modes of motion of the structure by
coarse-grained elastic network modelling using ElNemo [26]
and then generates trajectories of motion for the network by geometric simulation using the FRODA
algorithm [27] in a calculation in which the normal mode
eigenvectors are used to bias the motion of the network [28].
This method of simulation of flexible motion retains an all-atom representation of the protein and
uses a simplified physical model [29] to maintain the
covalent bond geometry and the network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic tethers found in the input
structure, and to enforce steric exclusion, while neglecting long-range interactions. This
simplification allows for a systematic exploration of motion along multiple normal mode directions,
achieving large amplitudes, using modest computational resources. The retention of all-atom detail
and of the essential local covalent and noncovalent interactions, meanwhile, makes the generated
structures physically realistic and useful for the interpretation of experimental data [30].

Normal modes of motion were generated for both full-length ERp27 (molecule B) and for the central
bb′ domains of full-length yeast PDI (from PDB code 2B5E). For each structure,
trajectories of flexible motion were generated using the ten lowest-frequency non-trivial normal
modes; these are modes 7–16, as modes 1–6 are combinations of trivial rigid body
motions. Biases were applied both parallel and antiparallel to the mode eigenvectors generating two
opposed trajectories for each normal mode, indicated as 7− and 7+. The bias step size in each
iteration of the simulation was 0.01 Å. The constraint network included all hydrophobic
tethers identified by FIRST in the input structures. Hydrogen bonds identified in the input
structure are assigned a (negative) energy in FIRST on the basis of their geometry, and the set of
bonds retained in the simulations is determined by setting a cut-off value. Simulations were carried
out using cut-off values of −1, −2 and −3 kcal/mol (1 kcal=4.184 kJ), with
essentially identical results. Results are presented for the cut-off of −2 kcal/mol. In total
2000 conformations were generated along each trajectory with every 100th conformation being recorded
as a PDB file for subsequent analysis. All simulations were carried out overnight on a dual-core 2.4
GHz desktop workstation running Linux.

In this case our principal interest was in the relative orientation of the two domains, and the
variation of this orientation in the course of large-scale flexible motion. To represent the
relative orientations of the two domains, a plane was calculated as representative of the
β-sheet plane in each domain, by selecting the Cα atoms of four
‘central’ residues, namely alternating central residues in each of the adjacent
antiparallel strands β2 and β4. These four atoms in each domain give a quadrilateral,
from which the plane normals and interplane axis are calculated. The ‘tilt’ angle
between adjacent domains (θ) is defined using the scalar product of the vectors corresponding
to the respective plane normals. The dihedral ‘twist’ angle (ω) makes use of
the vector between the ‘average’ position of the four selected Cα atoms in each
domain. This vector and the plane normal for each domain define a plane; the dihedral angle between
these two planes is the ‘twist’ angle (ω). Tilt and twist values were extracted
for the input structures and for the structures generated in the simulations of flexible motion.

RESULTS
Resonance assignment of the ERp27 b domain
Excluding the eight residues of the His tag (MHHHHHHM), chemical-shift assignments were made for
100% of the backbone amide 15N and 1H resonances, 100% of the
13Cα and 13Cβ resonances, 96.7% of the 1Hα
resonances, 94.5% of the 1Hβ resonances, 88.8% of the other side-chain
1H resonances (1Hγ, 1Hδ, 1Hϵ,
1Hζ and 1Hη), 70.6% of the side-chain 13C resonances
(13Cγ, 13Cδ, 13Cϵ, 13Cζ and
13Cη) and 26.1% of the side-chain 15N resonances
(15Nδ, 15Nϵ, 15Nζ and 15Nη).
Six residues had no side-chain assignments other than 13Cβ; Glu26,
Glu28, Ser30, Ser31, Glu122 and Glu125, of
which four (Glu26, Glu28, Ser30 and Ser31) are located
at the N-terminus and, following structure determination, were found to be in a flexible extension
outside of the core Trx fold (see below). The assigned backbone amide resonances are shown in the 2D
15N-1H HSQC spectrum in Figure 1. The
well-dispersed pattern of peaks indicates that the protein is folded. A total of 130 HSQC peaks were
identified. Of these, 18 were identified as asparagine and glutamine side-chain peaks, one was
assigned to the indole amide of the single tryptophan residue, one to the His-tag backbone and the
remainder were assigned to the backbone amides of the 110 non-proline residues.

Peaks are annotated to show the backbone amide assignments. All 110 non-proline residues have
been assigned. The indole ϵ1 amide of the single tryptophan residue (W42) has also been
assigned. Side-chain amide NH2 resonances are connected with horizontal lines.

NMR relaxation analysis
15N-NMR relaxation parameters T1,
T2 and heteronuclear NOE were obtained for the b domain of
ERp27 at 14.1 T (600 MHz 1H) and 25°C (Figure 2). The
average values for 15N T1 and T2
were recorded as 704±46 ms and 122±64 ms respectively; these data were
used to estimate the global correlation time for the domain of 7.13±0.71 ns using
χ2 optimization of the theoretical dipolar and practical
T1/T2 ratios. This estimate of global
correlation time confirms that the domain is monomeric under the experimental conditions used. NMR
relaxation parameters for each individual 15N were interrogated further using ModelFree
analysis which provides motional information in terms of order parameters
S2, internal correlation times τe and contributions to
chemical exchange Rex, for individual NH vectors across the domain
backbone (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/450/bj4500321add.htm). An unstructured N-terminal region was
identified from combined low S2 and high τe values for
residues 26–38. The average S2 value across the structured region
(residues 39–141) was 0.79±0.04 where S2 values of 1.0
support a completely rigid domain backbone and 0.01 support an entirely random flexible
backbone.

Figure 2 15N NMR relaxation parameters of the ERp27 b domain
Spin–lattice relaxation times T1 (A),
spin–spin relaxation times T2 (B) and
1H-15N heteronuclear NOE data (C) were collected at 14.1 T and
25°C and are plotted as a function of residue number. A schematic diagram of the domain
secondary structure as solved by NMR is shown above each plot. Cylinders represent α-helices
and arrows represent β-strands.

This value of S2 can be compared with those of oxidized and reduced
ERp18 (0.81 and 0.90 respectively) [31] and implies a
relatively flexible backbone which may provide capacity for diverse interactions with partner
proteins. Average internal correlation times across the structured region were 85±18 ps, a
typical value for a well-behaved globular domain. Within the structured region, five residues were
estimated to have τe values above 300 ps as seen in Supplementary Figure S1(B):
Leu43, Val72, Val95, Gly103 and Leu141. These
residues are all associated with loops or are the first residues of secondary structure elements and
these higher τe are due to either depressed T1 or
elevated T2 values as seen in Figures
2(A) and 2(B). These unusual τe values
were all obtained with low errors and, according to ModelFree analysis, they indicate significant
areas of the domain that have abnormally slow internal motions. Additional ModelFree contributions
to Rex were only observed for two residues, Leu111 and
Asp113 within the loop between strands β4 and β5 (Supplementary Figure
S1C), and are indicative of low T2 observed for the residues in Figure 2(B).

Structure calculations
In the final round of structure calculations, 1939 NOE-derived distance restraints, 117 dihedral
angle restraints and 42 hydrogen-bond restraints were used. In total 100 structures were generated,
of which 92 had converged satisfactorily. The converged structures had no distance violations
greater than 0.5 Å and no dihedral angle restraint violations greater than 5°. Of the
92 converged structures, the representative structure ensemble was chosen as the 50 lowest-energy
structures; superimposed backbone tracings of these structures are shown in Figure 3(A). None of the structures in the ensemble had NOE or hydrogen-bond
restraint violations greater than 0.3 Å. The NMR restraints and structural statistics are
summarized in Table 1. NOE distribution, structural
calculations and NMR relaxation data analysis confirmed that the structured region of the
b domain extends from Glu39 to Leu141. Figure 3(A) illustrates the diversity of conformations of the N-terminal region in
the individual structures and the structural limits of the domain are also confirmed by comparing
the RMSD (root mean square deviation) values between residues 26 and 141 and those between residues
39 and 141 (Table 1). Description and analysis of the
structure below is restricted to this structured region (Glu39–Leu141)
and is based on the individual structure in the ensemble closest to the mean structure; this is
illustrated in Figures 3(B) and 3(C) showing the assigned secondary structure.

C-termini are labelled N and C respectively. (B) and (C) show the single
representative structure of ERp27 b, residues 39–141 and are related by a

For (A), (B), (D) and (E), values are reported ±S.D. (A) The energy was obtained using
GROMOS96 within DEEPVIEW. (B) The RMSD to the mean structure was calculated using MOLMOL [46]. The mean structure was calculated independently for residues
26–141 and residues 39–141. The RMSD over the secondary structure regions used the
mean structure calculated for residues 39–141. The secondary structure was as assigned using
DSSP-CONT. (C) The total number of restraints was calculated using the total number of restrained
hydrogen bonds, rather than the total number of hydrogen-bond restraints. This is because each
restrained hydrogen bond had a set of two distance restraints. (D) The average number of all
restraint violations (NOE, hydrogen bond and dihedral restraint violations) was calculated for all
NOE and hydrogen bond violations greater than 0.1 Å and all dihedral angle violations greater
than 5°. The data in (D) and (E) were generated using CNS. (F) Procheck Ramachandran plot

The ordered region of the protein (residues 39–141) consists of a five-stranded mixed
β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices (Figure 3).
The secondary structure topology is
β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-β5-α4-α5.
Strands 1, 2 and 3 are parallel with each other, whereas strands 2, 4 and 5 are antiparallel. This
corresponds to the variant of the canonical Trx fold (SCOP reference number 52832) commonly found in
the PDI family [3], but with an α-helical insert
(α4) before the C-terminal α-helix of the fold (α5). The β1
strand is short (two residues), but this is common in the family (e.g. in the various domains of
yeast PDI [5] this strand comprises two, three, zero and four
residues). This structural analysis is supported by chemical-shift data (Supplementary Figure S2 at
http://www.biochemj.org/bj/450/bj4500321add.htm).

The structure ensemble was analysed using PROCHECK-NMR [32,33]. Over residues 39–141 of the ensemble,
74% of the non-glycine dihedral angles were in the most-favoured regions and 26% were in the
additionally allowed regions. Gly103 was the only residue with dihedral angles in a
generously allowed region of the plot. This residue is located on the loop between α3 and
β4. This corresponds to the cis-proline loop found in many domains in the
PDI family. Although there is no conserved proline residue in this loop in ERp27, Gly103
is in the equivalent position as the residue preceding the cis-proline in the
catalytic PDI domains.

Structural homology
Structural homologues of the b domain of ERp27 were identified by a search of the
PDB database using DALI [34]. In total 591 structure matches
with a Z-score greater than 2.0 were found. Matches were detected to each of the
five classes of Trx-fold proteins: Trx, glutaredoxin, glutathione transferase, DsbA and glutathione
peroxidase. The highest-scoring matches were the structures of the b domains of ERp57
[35], human PDI [36],
calsequestrin [37], ERp72 [38], yeast PDI [5], ERp29 [39] and ERp44 [40]. ERp27 b
also showed significant structural similarity to Trx despite lacking the active-site residues and
the conserved cis-proline residue. Ten out of the 20 highest-scoring matches were
to Trxs.

The structure of ERp27 b domain is notable in having an α-helical insert
between β5 and α4 of the standard PDI fold. This helix is short, consisting of only
four residues, and is situated adjacent in the tertiary structure to the loop which contains the
active site (in a-type PDI domains). A similar non-canonical helix is found in the
yeast PDI b domain [5]. However, the structure of
yeast PDI b differs significantly from that of ERp27 b in that it does not
contain α3 of the canonical fold. Both ERp57 b and ERp72 b differ
from the structure of ERp27 b most significantly in the loop region between β4
and β5, which is extended in these two proteins. Structure superimpositions between ERp27
b and selected homologous proteins are shown in Figure
4. A structure-based multiple sequence alignment between ERp27 b and selected
homologues is shown in Supplementary Figure S3 (at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/450/bj4500321add.htm).

Structures were aligned using DALI [34]. The single
structure of ERp27 b with the lowest backbone RMSD to the mean structure over residues
39–141 was used. The structure of ERp27 b is shown in blue. The secondary
structure elements of ERp27 b are labelled. The N- and C-termini of ERp27
b are labelled N and C. ERp27 b is aligned with (A) human Trx
(PDB code 1ERT, residues 1–105, RMSD=1.8 Å over 95 residues), (B) human
PDI b domain (PDB code 2BJX, residues 119–216, RMSD=1.8 Å over 98
residues), (C) yeast PDI b domain (PDB code 2B5E, residues 142–237,
RMSD=2.3 Å over 90 residues) and (D) human ERp57 b′ domain
(PDB code 2H8L, residues 135–240, RMSD=1.9 Å over 97 residues). In (A)
the catalytic cysteine residues of Trx are displayed in ball-and-stick representation.
Glu68 of ERp27 b is also shown. This residue is located in the active-site
loop and is strictly conserved in ERp27. In (C) the α-helical insertion in ERp27
b (α4) and yeast PDI b is indicated.

Sequence conservation
The sequence of ERp27 has only been found in vertebrate genomes. The sequence alignment in
Supplementary Figure S4 (at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/450/bj4500321add.htm) shows a range of ERp27 b
sequences from mammalian, bird, reptile and fish genomes. The sequence of ERp27 b is
well conserved across species. The majority of conserved residues are located in the hydrophobic
core of the protein, predominantly on β-strands 2, 3 and 4 and on the interior faces of the
surrounding α-helices. In the alignment in Supplementary Figure S4 there are 13 positions
that are invariant between ERp27 sequences. These correspond to Leu43, Glu57,
Val58, Gly62, Phe63, Glu68, Val85,
Val95, Leu108, Phe109, Arg110, Asp113 and
Phe135 of human ERp27. Of these residues, nine (Leu43, Glu58,
Val58, Glu68, Val85, Phe109, Arg110,
Asp113 and Phe135) are surface-exposed. Gly62 and Phe63
are buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein and are situated at the C-terminal end of
β2. These two residues are highly conserved in all b domains of the human PDI
family (Supplementary Figure S3), with the exception of ERp29. Glu68 is located on the
loop between β2 and α2. This is the location of the active site in the catalytically
active domains of the PDI family. Glu57 and Val58 are situated at the
N-terminus of β2, Arg110 is situated at the C-terminus of β4 and
Asp113 is situated on the loop between β4 and β5. These residues are
surface-exposed on a common face of the protein. The side chains of Arg110 and
Asp113 are positioned so as to form a salt bridge. These residues are also present in the
b domains of human PDI, ERp57 and ERp29, although in human PDI the arginine residue is
replaced by a lysine (Supplementary Figure S3).

The b to b′ domain interface on the b domain
1H-15N HSQC spectra have been collected for both full-length ERp27 and the
individual b domain (Supplementary Figure S5 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/450/bj4500321add.htm). Signals in these spectra are highly
sensitive to the local chemical environment of the backbone amide groups. A comparison of these
spectra may therefore allow identification of those residues in b which are in contact
with b′ in full-length ERp27. Residues in b potentially forming the
interface between b and b′ in full-length ERp27 were therefore
identified using the minimal shift approach [23,24]. The distance between each assigned cross-peak in the spectrum
for the b domain to the nearest cross-peak in the spectrum for the full-length protein
was measured. The minimal shift values per residue are plotted in the histogram in Figure 5(A). Residues 136–141 at the C-terminus of the
b domain are inevitably close to the subsequent b′ domain; omitting
these from further consideration, the average minimal shift of the remaining residues was
0.0333±0.0292. Figure 5(A) shows that the residues with
large minimal shifts are clustered in three regions of sequence, namely residues 53–65,
80–87 and 110–119; within these regions, 19 out of 31 residues have minimal shifts
>1 S.D. above the mean and most of the others have shifts above the mean. To interpret the
shifts in relation to structure, all residues within these regions were included in a map of the
possible interdomain surface; these were plotted on to the domain structure in Figure 5(B), which shows clearly that the regions identified in this way are located
on one face of the protein. Similar regions of the fold make up the b to
b′ domain interfaces in PDI, ERp57, ERp44, calsequestrin and ERp72 [5,35,37,38,40]. Calculation of the electrostatic potential shows the postulated interface region to be
predominantly hydrophobic with charged residues around the edge (Figure 5C). There are patches of negative charge created, for example, by the
surface-exposed side chains of Glu57, Asp113 and Glu137. There is
considerable sequence conservation on the surface of the postulated b to
b′ interface (Figure 5D). In particular,
Glu57, Val58, Val85, Arg110, Asp113 and
Phe135 are strictly conserved in ERp27 (Supplementary Figure S4), whereas
Ala59, Val112, Asn139 and Leu141 in the interface are
conserved in over 80% of ERp27 sequences.

We were provided with the atomic co-ordinates of an X-ray structure of full-length
ERp27 in advance of publication (PDB code 4F9Z) allowing a direct comparison of our inferred
interface with that determined by X-ray diffraction.

The NMR minimal shift data in the present paper predict that the interdomain interface is
homologous with that between the b and b′ domains in other
multidomain members of the PDI family and this is broadly confirmed by the X-ray structure of the
full-length protein, although the X-ray structure indicates an unusual interdomain angle. For a
precise comparison, we selected ‘domain contact residues’ on the b domain
by choosing the residues showing the greatest ‘minimal shifts’ in
1H-15N resonances in the NMR data and the closest interdomain atom contacts in
the crystal structure data, excluding the residues at the C-terminus of the b domain
(residues 136–141) which are inevitably in contact with or close to the
b′ domain. Both approaches highlighted the same three regions on the
b domain: I53AATEVAVIGFFQ65, Q80KFPGVSF87
and R110LVDNEQLNL119. Within these regions, eight residues were identified as
contact residues by both criteria (Ile53, Ala54, Ala55,
Glu57, Gly84, Leu111, Val112 and Asn114), 11
were identified by the NMR criterion only (Ala59, Ile61, Gln65,
Gln80, Val85, Ser86, Phe87, Arg110,
Gln116, Leu117 and Leu119), and four by the X-ray criterion only
(Thr56, Val58, Asp113 and Glu115). Hence the contact
surface highlighted by NMR is more extensive than that indicated in the crystal structure.

The X-ray data represent a static structure whereas shifts in NMR resonances could represent
indirect effects, but will certainly also reflect perturbations that arise from solution dynamics.
We therefore attempted to explore the potential flexibility of the molecule using a new rapid method
[28].

Simulation of the flexibility of full-length ERp27 reconciles NMR and X-ray analyses of the
interdomain interface
Examination of the trajectories of flexible motion showed that, for both ERp27 and PDI
bb′, the largest amplitudes of flexible motion are achieved by the three
lowest-frequency non-trivial normal modes (modes 7, 8 and 9), which are combinations of rotation
about the interdomain axis, and tilting around the interdomain interface. Further discussion of
results is focussed on these modes. To analyse these motions, we have defined the planes represented
by the core β-sheet in each domain and extracted the ‘tilt’ and
‘twist’ angles between these planes (see the Materials and methods section). Figure 6(A) is a ‘tilt/twist’ plot of the interdomain
orientations and confirms that the relative orientation of the domains in ERp27 is distinct from
that in yeast PDI (arrows); it shows that the two structures differ in twist angle as well as in
tilt angle (ERp27, tilt +34o and twist −33o; compared with PDI
bb′, tilt +51o and twist +53o).

Figure 6 Domain orientation, flexibility and interdomain contacts in ERp27
(A) Relative orientation of the β-sheet planes in adjacent Trx-fold domains
for ERp27 and for the b-b′ moiety of yeast PDI. The planes are defined by the
positions of four Cα atoms in each domain, as follows: for ERp27 domain b,
Val60, Gly62, Ile106 and Leu108; for ERp27 domain
b′, Leu164, Leu166, Leu222 and
Ile224; for PDI b domain, Ile163, Gln165,
Leu202 and Ile204; and for PDI b′ domain,
Gly260, Leu262, Phe314 and Ile316. Orientation is
described by a tilt angle between the plane normals, and by a dihedral twist angle formed by the
plane normals and the interplane vector. The orientation in the PDB code 2B5E crystal structure of
PDI is indicated by a grey arrow and that in the ERp27 crystal structure (PDB code 4F9Z [43]) by a black arrow. Symbols (open for PDI, closed for ERp27)
show flexible motion along the three lowest-frequency non-trivial elastic network modes (modes 7, 8
and 9), in positive and negative directions, for each structure. Motion of ERp27 along mode
7− leads to PDI-like interdomain orientations. (B) Backbone cartoon overlay of
ERp27 (black) with PDI b-b′ (white) crystal structures, aligned on the
b′ domain (left-hand side) only, showing very different b-b′
orientations. (C) Corresponding backbone cartoon overlay of ERp27 after projection

b domain β-sheets of ERp27 and PDI are now coplanar. (D) Backbone
cartoon of ERp27 after projection along mode 7− (black). Residues 59 (dark grey), 82, 83 and
86 (all light grey), and 110 (white) are shown as spheres. These residues make new contacts with
domain b′, not found in the input crystal structure. (E) Backbone
cartoon of ERp27 after projection along mode 7+ (black), showing residues 110, 116, 117 and 118 as
white spheres, forming new contacts with domain b′. (F) Backbone
cartoon of ERp27 after projection along mode 8− (black), showing residues 59 and 60 (dark
grey spheres), 80–83, 86 and 87 (light-grey spheres), and 110 (white spheres) forming new
contacts with domain b′.

Trajectories of flexible motion are shown by calculating and plotting tilt and twist angles for
every 100th structure in a simulated trajectory. In the case of ERp27, modes 8 and 9 correspond to
tilting motions with the interdomain link acting as a hinge (as shown by a clear change in tilt
angle but a very limited change in twist angle); PDI bb′ shows similar behaviour
in modes 7 and 9 although the change in twist angle is slightly greater. For ERp27, mode 7, the
lowest frequency non-trivial normal mode, shows the most striking results; this mode generates a
pronounced twist, effectively a counter-rotation of the two domains around the axis joining the two
domains. A similar motion in PDI bb′ is generated by its normal mode 8. What is
notable is that this flexibility is much greater for ERp27 (a total amplitude of twist from
−120o to +60o) than for PDI bb′, and that the
extent of this motion for ERp27 allows it to take up a relative orientation very close to that found
initially in PDI bb′. This reorientation of ERp27 to a more PDI-like structure
is illustrated in Figures 6(B) and 6(C). Furthermore, in the course of facile motion along modes 7, 8 and 9, many
residues in the loops identified by NMR as ‘contact loops’ move to make new contacts
with the b′ domain (Figures 6D–6F). Using as the contact criterion that any backbone atom of a
residue in the b domain is at a distance <7 Å from any
non-hydrogen atom in the b′ domain, we find that
Ile53–Val58, Gly84–Val85 and
Leu111–Glu115 initially make contact with the b′
domain in at least one of the five molecules of ERp27 in the crystal unit cell. Flexible
motion along the trajectories of modes 7–9 brings about new contacts, and almost all of the
residues identified as being ‘contact’ residues by the NMR criterion are now seen to
make contact with the b′ domain. Flexible twisting motion along the mode
7− trajectory (towards the PDI bb′ conformation) generates contacts
between the b′ domain residues Ala59, Phe82,
Pro83, Ser86 and Arg110, whereas motion along trajectory 7+
generates new contacts with Pro83, Phe87, Arg110,
Gln116, Leu117 and Asn118. Similarly, tilting motion along mode
8− generates new contacts with Ala59, Val60, Gln80,
Lys81, Phe82, Pro83, Ser86, Phe87 and
Arg110 and that along mode 8+ generates new contacts with Arg110,
Gln116, Leu117 and Asn118. New contacts made by motion along
trajectories 9− and 9+ are all drawn from the same set of residues. Of the 11 non-proline
residues in this set, four (Ala59, Gln80, Ser86 and
Leu117) are the residues showing the greatest resonance shifts in the NMR analysis (Figure 5A) and these are four out of five residues showing shifts of
greater than the mean+2 S.D., whereas a further three of the ‘new contact’ set
(Phe87, Arg110 and Gln116) have shifts greater than the mean+S.D.
Hence our simulations of flexible motion in ERp27 reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the
interdomain contact region identified by NMR and that identified in the crystal structure

DISCUSSION
The N-terminal (b) domain of ERp27 was expressed in high yield, was highly soluble
and very stable in solution, allowing the collection of high-quality 2D and 3D NMR data. By
contrast, the C-terminal domain (b′) could not be expressed in isolation as a
soluble protein and we did not succeed in strategies aimed at deriving it from cleavage of a fusion
construct. Full-length ERp27 was readily expressed and gave a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum [9], but did not remain soluble through long-term NMR data collection
at temperatures >30°C, preventing the collection of usable 3D data sets for full
assignment and structure calculations. It is now well-established that the ligand-binding
b′-type domains of the PDI family are the most difficult to generate and study
in isolation; high-resolution structures of these domains have only been determined in the presence
either of an adjacent domain or of a C-terminal extension sequence which is capable of occupying the
hydrophobic cleft which constitutes the substrate-binding site [41]. Without one or other of these extensions in place, the isolated b′
domains have a tendency to oligomerize and aggregate [42],
presumably as a result of the exposure of their hydrophobic ligand-binding sites.

The solution structure of the b domain reported in the present paper is highly
congruent with the structure of this domain in full-length ERp27, determined by X-ray diffraction
[43]. The two structures superimpose extremely closely with
RMSD values of 0.96 Å over 102 Cα atoms and of 1.02 Å over the corresponding
408 backbone atoms (taking molecule D of the crystal structure as representative). The residues
showing the greatest RMSD are in loops at either end of β3 (Gly103 and
Val112) and in the loop containing the ‘additional’ helix
(Glu122). The structural context of Gly103 has been noted above as
corresponding to the residue preceding the conserved cis-proline residue in
catalytic redox-active Trx domains, and this residue also shows up in the relaxation data as having
an unusually slow internal correlation time.

It was noted (above) that ERp27 b has an α-helical insert between β5
and α4 of the conventional PDI domain fold. The equivalent region in the catalytic
a and a′ domains of PDI, the loop between β5 and α4,
contains a conserved arginine residue that has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism [44]. Short α-helical inserts also exist in analogous
positions in yeast PDI b [4] and ERp44
b′ [40]. There is some sequence
similarity between these inserts, with the C-terminus of each helix ending in the sequence Asp-X,
where X is a hydrophobic branched-chain aliphatic residue. The side chain of the aspartate residue
is surface-exposed and that of the hydrophobic residue is directed inwards, towards the core of the
protein. The b′ domain of yeast PDI also contains an α-helical insert at
this position, but this is part of a larger insert between β5 and α4 of the fold.
There is no structural information available for the b domains of PDIp or PDILT, but
these proteins appear to have insertions in the protein sequence at a similar position to the
helical inserts in ERp27 b and yeast PDI b (Supplementary Figure S3). It
is therefore possible that PDIp and PDILT also possess the structural feature of an additional
α-helix at this location.

We found that ERp27 has a large capacity for flexible motion owing to its two-domain structure
with relatively few interdomain constraints. The lowest-frequency non-trivial normal modes of motion
for ERp27 represent a twisting motion around the interdomain axis (mode 7) and tilting motions where
the interdomain interface acts as a hinge (modes 8 and 9). The b-b′ moiety of
PDI has a similar structure with slightly more interdomain constraints and a similar (although
slightly smaller) range of flexible variation. Twist motion of ERp27 along mode 7− carries
its interdomain orientation from the distinctive state identified in the crystal structure to a
PDI-like state. The inference that ERp27 is a highly flexible molecule is corroborated by
interdomain contact information from NMR, which also suggests considerable interdomain motion
(including motion towards a more PDI-like orientational state). Simulations of flexible motion along
low-frequency modes generate multiple new interdomain contacts which correlate well with the
interdomain contacts suggested by NMR. A further implication is that both ERp27 and PDI have
considerable conformational flexibility in solution and that the crystal structures have captured
particular orientations from a much wider ensemble of flexible variation. The crystallization of
full-length ERp27 in a novel interdomain orientation has revealed the extent of this
variation, not previously revealed by other PDI family crystal structures.

The paucity of information on the function of the b domain of ERp27 makes it
difficult to interpret these results in functional terms. If the function of the b
domain is purely passive (e.g. to confer solubility on the functional ligand-binding
b′ domain), then the flexibility of the interdomain linker could arise
negatively from the lack of any functional constraints determining relative orientation; this would
contrast with PDI and other multidomain family members, where the b-b′ domain
pair must partially constrain the positions and orientations of the adjacent functional
a and a′ domains [4,45]. Alternatively, if the b domain plays a role in
interactions between ERp27 and other chaperones or folding factors within the ER lumen, then the
interdomain flexibility may be a positive factor in enabling alternative orientations for the
domains in interactions with different partners. A recent publication confirmed that many members of
the PDI family, including PDI, PDIr, ERp57, ERp72, P5, ERdj5 and ERp29, make multiple interactions
with partner proteins within the ER ([45] see, for example,
Figure 2A in this reference). Unfortunately, ERp27 was not
included as a subject in that study, and in any case we lack structural information to underpin the
majority of these inferred protein–protein interactions. In the absence of more information
on the cellular role of ERp27, further comments on the significance of the flexible interdomain
hinge between b and b′ domains are speculative.
