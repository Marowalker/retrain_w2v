It has been brought to our attention that Figure 1(A) contains a background subtraction box in the lane labelled ‘Control + IgG’. As this band represented an important negative control, this has serious potential to affect the conclusions drawn in the paper, and therefore we are retracting this paper. We thank the Editorial Board of the Biochemical Journal for pointing out this error.
