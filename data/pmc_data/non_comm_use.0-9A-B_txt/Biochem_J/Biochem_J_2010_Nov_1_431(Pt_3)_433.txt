The second sentence of this article's abstract contains an error: the word ‘used’
should be ‘based’. The corrected sentence appears here.

We describe the synthesis and properties of a novel series of non-covalent di-peptide inhibitors
of the proteasome based on a capped tri-peptide that was first identified by
high-throughput screening of a library of approx. 350000 compounds for inhibitors of the
ubiquitin–proteasome system in cells.
