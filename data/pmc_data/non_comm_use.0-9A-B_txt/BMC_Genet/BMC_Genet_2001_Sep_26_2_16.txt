Correction
1) Legend to figure 7 should read: "There is no strong correlation between the average systolic blood pressure of each strain and the average IOP of that strain (R2 = 0.1). All mice were female and 2 to 4 months old, with the exception that the female CBA/CaJ used for IOP assessment were 6 to 7 months old. If the CBA/CaJ mice are excluded, R2 drops to 0.01. Of ARK/J, C57BL/6J and SJL/J, strain ARK/J had the highest IOP and strain SJL/J the lowest IOP.

2) In table 1, the strain NZB/BiNJ should read: NZB/B1NJ.

3) In the results section dealing with Myoc alleles, the MYOC and Myoc should both be in italics.
