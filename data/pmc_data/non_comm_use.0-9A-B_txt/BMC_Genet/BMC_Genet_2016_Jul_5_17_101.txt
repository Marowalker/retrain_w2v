==== Body
Following publication of the original article in BMC Genetics [1], it was brought to our attention that the authors Min Mu and Xu-Ke contributed equally to this work.

Furthermore, the keywords “Rehalose-6-phosphase synthase (TPS) and Gossypium arboretum” are incorrect and should read: Trehalose-6-phosphase (TPS) and Gossypium arboretum L.

Also, in the “Methods-Expression patterns analysis of cotton TPSs under stresses” section, two extra blanks were introduced in “2- Δ ΔCT” in the last sentence. The sentence should read: Relative quantitative analysis of target genes was calculated with the 2-ΔΔCT method.

The original article has been updated with the changes listed above.
