As there is currently no cure for dementia, there is an urgent need for preventive strategies. The current review provides an overview of the existing evidence examining the associations of the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets and their dietary components with cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic search was conducted within Ovid Medline for studies published up to 27 March 2019 and reference lists from existing reviews and select articles were examined to supplement the electronic search results. In total, 56 articles were included. Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive scores in 9 of 12 cross-sectional studies, 17 of 25 longitudinal studies, and 1 of 3 trials. Higher adherence to the DASH diet was associated with better cognitive function in 1 cross-sectional study, 2 of 5 longitudinal studies, and 1 trial. Higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with better cognitive scores in 1 cross-sectional study and 2 of 3 longitudinal studies. Evidence on the association of these dietary patterns with dementia in general was limited. However, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of AD in 1 case-control study and 6 of 8 longitudinal studies. Moreover, higher adherence to the DASH or MIND diets was associated with a lower AD risk in 1 longitudinal study. With respect to the components of these dietary patterns, olive oil may be associated with less cognitive decline. In conclusion, current scientific evidence suggests that higher adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets is associated with less cognitive decline and a lower risk of AD, where the strongest associations are observed for the MIND diet.

Introduction
In 2015 ∼47 million people worldwide were diagnosed with dementia, which is the seventh leading cause of death worldwide (1). Due to the global aging population, the number of people living with dementia is expected to increase to 75 million by 2030 (2). With estimated global costs of dementia of 818 billion US$ in 2015, representing 1.09% of the global gross domestic product, dementia has a huge impact on societal healthcare costs (2, 3).

As there is currently no cure for dementia, preventative measures are of major importance to reduce the expected rise in dementia cases (2). To date, many studies have examined the role of nutrients and foods in the prevention of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (4–6). Over recent decades, research has shifted towards studying dietary patterns to take into account interactions between nutrients or foods and possible synergic effects of nutrients (7, 8). Three dietary patterns that have been frequently studied in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, or AD are the Mediterranean diet (9), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (10), and the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet (11).

The Mediterranean diet is a dietary pattern that is consumed in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, for example in Greece (9). Meta-analyses indicate that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with better global cognition and episodic memory (12), a lower risk of cognitive impairment (13, 14), and a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases (13, 15). The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high consumption of fruits, vegetables, and olive oil, with a moderate consumption of alcohol (16, 17). Similar to the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet also specifies a high consumption of plant-based foods and additionally limits the intake of SFAs, total fat, cholesterol, and sodium (10). The DASH dietary pattern has been developed to prevent and treat hypertension and has been shown to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol (10, 18). The MIND dietary pattern has been developed to protect the brain and prevent against dementia (11). This dietary pattern is a combination of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet and is based on dietary components that have been shown to be neuroprotective. The MIND diet emphasizes natural plant-based foods and limited intakes of animal foods and foods high in saturated fat. Uniquely, the MIND diet also specifies the consumption of berries and green leafy vegetables (11).

So far, 10 reviews have discussed the current evidence on the association of the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets with cognitive decline, dementia, or AD (19–28). However, 5 of these reviews only included a brief summary of the available evidence (19, 21–24). Of the 4 extensive reviews on the topic, 1 review only included studies of the past 5 y (27), 2 reviews only included observational studies (20, 25), and 2 also discussed intervention studies (26, 28). However, 1 of the reviews that also discussed intervention studies only included studies until 2015 (26) and the other only included cohort and intervention studies (28).

Therefore, the aim of the current review is to summarize, evaluate, and compare all existing observational and trial evidence published up to 27 March 2019 for the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets and their dietary components in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, and AD in middle-aged and older adults aged ≥40 y.

Methods
Literature search and study design
For this review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. A systematic search was conducted within Ovid Medline for all studies published in English up to 27 March 2019. Search terms included terms related to cognition, dementia, AD, Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and MIND diet (Supplemental Table 1). Commentaries, letters, editorials, news, and newspaper articles were not screened. A predefined protocol was not available. The systematic search in Ovid Medline resulted in 163 articles (Supplemental Table 1). Reference lists from existing reviews and select articles were examined to identify studies that were not retrieved by the systematic search in Ovid Medline. This resulted in 6 additional studies. First, titles and abstracts were screened, resulting in 73 potentially relevant articles. Studies were included if: 1) they were performed in adults aged ≥40 y, 2) they measured exposure to ≥1 of the 3 dietary patterns of interest (Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, or MIND diet) or to dietary components as part of these 3 dietary patterns, and 3) the outcome measure was related to cognition, cognitive decline, dementia, or AD. The eligibility criteria of participants aged ≥40 y was selected, because cognitive decline has been shown to be already present in middle age (29). After full-text screening, 56 of the 73 articles were included in this review (Figure 1). For the dietary components of the 3 dietary patterns, evidence is restricted to articles identified using the search strategy for the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, and AD. Study selection and data extraction was performed by 1 researcher and checked by a second researcher.

Quality assessment
The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the following criteria: 1) number of study participants, 2) in the case of prospective studies, duration of follow-up and loss to follow-up, 3) exposure measurement, 4) outcome measurement, and 5) adjustment for potential confounders.

Dietary pattern scores
The Mediterranean, DASH , and MIND diets all have a plant-based origin with moderate to high amounts of fish, but they differ in types and amounts of dietary components. A detailed list of components per diet can be found in Table 1. The assessment of these diets is described below.

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet can be assessed by 2 different scores, namely the original Mediterranean diet score by Trichopoulou et al. (9) and the alternate Mediterranean diet score by Panagiotakos et al. (30). The original score of Trichopoulou et al. ranges from 0 (minimal adherence to the Mediterranean diet) to 9 (maximal adherence) and is based on sex-specific median intake of the study population on 9 components (9). For fish, cereals, fruits + nuts, vegetables, legumes, and MUFA to SFA ratio (MUFA:SFA ratio), a value of 1 is assigned to people who have intake above the median, whereas a value of 0 is assigned to people with intake below the median. For meat and dairy, a value of 1 is assigned to people with intake below the median, whereas a value of 0 is assigned to people with intake above the median. Regarding alcohol, a value of 1 is assigned to people consuming a moderate amount. The alternate score by Panagiotakos et al. ranges from 0 (minimal adherence to the Mediterranean diet) to 55 (maximal adherence) and is based on the consumption of 11 components (30). For each dietary component, a value ranging from 0 to 5 is assigned to people based on predefined cut-offs of intake. For olive oil, fish, nonrefined cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and potatoes a value of 5 is assigned to people with high intake, whereas for meat and meat products, poultry, and full-fat dairy products a score of 5 is assigned to people without consumption. For alcohol, a value of 5 is assigned to people consuming a moderate amount, whereas a value of 0 is assigned to people with either no intake or very high intake.

Adherence to the DASH dietary pattern can also be assessed by 2 different scores, namely the score by Folsom et al. (31) and the score by Fung et al. (32). The score by Folsom et al. is based on predefined cut-offs of intake of 11 components and ranges from 0 (minimal adherence to the DASH diet) to 11 (maximal adherence). For each dietary component a value of 0, 0.5, or 1 is assigned based on intake (31). For total grains, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy foods, and nuts + seeds + dry beans a value of 1 is assigned to people with high intake. For sodium, sweets, percentage kcal from fat, percentage kcal from SFAs, and meats + poultry + fish a value of 1 is assigned to people with low intake. The score by Fung et al. is based on 8 dietary components and for each component a score of 1 to 5 is assigned based on quintile of intake (32). For whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and low-fat dairy products a score of 5 is assigned to people with the highest quintile of intake, whereas for sodium, red and processed meats, and sweetened beverages a score of 5 is assigned to people with the lowest quintile of intake. Thus, this score ranges from 8 (minimal adherence to the DASH diet) to 40 (maximal adherence).

The MIND diet score by Morris et al. is based on 15 dietary components and ranges from 0 (minimal adherence to the MIND diet) to 15 (maximal adherence) (11). A value of 0, 0.5, or 1 assigned to people for intake of each dietary component based on predefined cut-offs. For olive oil, fish, whole grains, berries, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, beans, and poultry a value of 1 is assigned to people with high intake. For butter + margarine, cheese, red meat and products, fast fried foods, and pastries and sweets a value of 1 is assigned to people with low intake. For wine, a value of 1 is assigned to people with moderate intake.

Results
In total, 50 observational studies and 4 randomized controlled trials were included. Key characteristics and findings of these studies, categorized by dietary pattern and study design (observational or trial) are shown in Tables 2–6. Considerable variations among studies were observed in the country, numbers, age and sex of participants, dietary assessment methods, and dietary components used to measure adherence score to the diets. Of the observational studies and trials, 16 studies were conducted in Mediterranean countries including Spain (33–38), Greece (39–42), Italy (43–45), and France (46–48), and 26 studies were performed in the United States (11, 49–73). The other studies were conducted in Australia (74–78), Sweden (79–81), China (82, 83), Poland (84), Puerto Rico (85), Scotland (86), and Israel (51). Sample sizes ranged from 79 (33) to 27,842 (64) participants. The vast majority of the observational studies and trials were performed in participants aged ≥60 y (n = 38), 6 studies only included women (52, 66, 67, 70, 72, 73), and 2 studies only included men (64, 80). Most studies assessed dietary intake with an FFQ; 9 studies used either repeated 24-h dietary recalls (33, 46, 51, 83), repeated food diaries (80, 81), a diet adherence screener (35), or a combination of these dietary assessment methods (47, 50). Evidence per dietary pattern and study design is discussed below.

Mediterranean diet
Cross-sectional studies
The Mediterranean diet in relation to cognitive function, dementia, or AD was investigated in 12 cross-sectional studies and 1 case-control study (Table 2) (33, 39, 40, 49–51, 57, 61, 74, 82, 84–86). In 3 of these studies the Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive functioning, including Spanish (n = 79) (33), American (n = 5907) (57), and a combination of Israeli (n = 1786) and American (n = 2791) (51) participants. In addition, in 4 studies, including middle-aged and older Greek (n = 1864) (39), Polish (n = 87) (84), Scottish (n = 878) (86), and Puerto Rican (n = 1269) (85) participants, the Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive function in specific domains, including global cognition, memory, language, executive functioning, and verbal ability. Furthermore, in a study of elderly Greek participants (n = 557) each 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment in men (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98; P = 0.02), but an increased risk of cognitive impairment in women (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.22; P = 0.04) (40). Moreover, a study in US middle-aged participants (n = 116) observed an association between higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet and larger cortical thickness of the posterior cingulate cortex (β: 0.023; P = 0.004), whereas no association with cognitive function was observed (49). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cognitive function were not associated in the remaining 3 studies among Chinese (n = 3670) (82), Australian (n = 1183) (74), and US (n = 160) (50) participants.

With respect to dementia, 1 Greek cross-sectional study (n = 1864) investigated the association between the Mediterranean diet and dementia and showed an 8% lower risk of dementia (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97; P = 0.004) for a 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score and a 56% lower dementia risk in the highest quartile of Mediterranean diet adherence (ORQ4vs.Q1: 0.440; 95% CI: 0.208, 0.969; P-trend = 0.019) (39). In a case-control study (n = 1984), each 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 24% lower risk of AD (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.87; P < 0.001); additionally, the highest tertile of Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a 69% lower risk of AD (ORT3vs.T1: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.58; P-trend < 0.001) (61).

Longitudinal studies
In total, 31 longitudinal studies investigated the Mediterranean diet in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, or AD (Table 2) (34, 41–44, 46, 47, 52–56, 59, 60, 62–71, 75–77, 79–81, 83). Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with less cognitive decline after 4 to 26 y of follow-up in 7 of 23 longitudinal studies in American (n = 3790 ≤ 27,842) (64, 68, 71), Swedish (n = 2223) (79), Spanish (n = 823) (34), Italian (n = 832) (43), and Greek (n = 401) (41) participants. In 6 studies including American (n = 826 ≤ 16,058) (54, 66, 69), Australian (n = 970) (77), and French adults (n = 1410 and 3038) (46, 47), the Mediterranean diet was associated with less cognitive decline in specific cognitive domains after 1.5 to 13 y of follow-up. Participants from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) (n = 1880) showed an 8% lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for each 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99; P = 0.04) after 4.5 y of follow-up (59). However, this association was not significant when studied by Mediterranean diet adherence in tertile (HRT3vs.T1: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.00; P-trend = 0.05). Additionally, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with less cognitive decline in African-American older adults (mean difference: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.39; P = 0.01), but not in white American older adults (n = 2326) (65). Furthermore, stratified analysis suggested a beneficial association in Chinese participants (n = 1650) aged ≥65 y, but not in younger participants (83). Moreover, in Swedish older men (n = 1038) higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment (ORT3vs.T1: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.89) after 12 y of follow-up in a subpopulation of participants with energy intake according to the Goldberg cut-off only (80). In the other 8 studies including American (n = 1233 ≤ 6425) (52, 56, 67, 70), Italian (n = 309) (44), Greek (n = 732) (42), Australian (n = 1528) (76), and Swedish participants (n = 194) (81) the Mediterranean diet was not associated with cognitive decline after 2.2 y to ≤10.6 y of follow-up. The Mediterranean diet was not associated with total brain volume, gray matter volume, or white matter volume after 5 y of follow-up among Swedish older adults (n = 194) (81).

With respect to dementia, Mediterranean diet adherence was not associated with dementia among French (n = 1410) (47), Swedish (n = 1038) (80), and Australian (n = 1220) (75) older adults after 4.1 y to ≤12 y of follow-up. In 3 studies, 2 studies in participants from the WHICAP (n = 1880 and n = 1984) (60, 61) and 1 study in participants from the Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (n = 923) (53), a significantly lower risk of AD was shown with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet after 3.8 y to ≤5.4 y of follow-up. In these studies a 40 to 54% lower risk of AD was shown for the highest tertile of Mediterranean diet adherence and a 9% lower risk of AD was found for each 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score. The WHICAP also demonstrated a lower AD risk in people with MCI for the highest tertile of adherence (HRT3vs.T1: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02) after 4.3 y of follow-up (n = 1875), but not when the Mediterranean diet score was analyzed per unit increase (59). Furthermore, in the WHICAP II (n = 1219) each 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 13% lower risk of AD (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97; P = 0.01) after 3.8 y of follow-up (55). A borderline nonsignificant association was observed for the highest tertile of Mediterranean diet adherence (HRT3vs.T1: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.08; P-trend = 0.06). Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was not associated with AD after 4.1 and 12 y of follow-up among French (n = 1410) (47) and Swedish (n = 1038) (80) older adults. Finally, each 1-unit increase in Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 24% lower risk of mortality from AD (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.89; P = 0.001) among American older adults (n = 192), where the upper Mediterranean diet adherence tertile was associated with a 73% lower AD risk (HRT3vs.T1: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.69; P-trend = 0.003) after 4.4 y of follow-up (63).

Trial evidence
The effect of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive decline was reported in 5 articles, representing 3 randomized controlled trials (Table 3) (35–37, 78, 87). After a 6-mo intervention in Australian healthy elderly participants (n = 137) no significant difference between the Mediterranean diet group and the control group was observed for the cognitive domains executive function, memory, processing speed, or visual-spatial memory (78). The Prevención con dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial investigated the effect of the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts on cognitive decline and compared this with a low-fat control diet in Spanish adults at high vascular risk, which resulted in 3 articles based on 3 different population samples (35–37). Higher Mediterranean diet adherence with extra-virgin olive oil during 6.5 y was related to better cognitive performance (n = 522) (36) and a lower risk of MCI (n = 268) (37). Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil was also related to improved global cognition and frontal cognition, but had no effect on memory and MCI after 4.1 y of intervention (n = 334) (35). Evidence on the effect of the Mediterranean diet with nuts on cognition was mixed (35–37). Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet with nuts did not affect the risk of MCI (35, 36). In 1 of the PREDIMED populations (n = 522) the Mediterranean diet with nuts improved global cognition (mean difference for Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.11, 1.03, P = 0.015; mean difference for the clock-drawing test [CDT]: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.67; P = 0.048) (36), whereas another PREDIMED population (n = 268) did not show an effect of the Mediterranean diet with nuts (37). In addition, another PREDIMED sample (n = 334) suggested that the Mediterranean diet with nuts particularly improved memory, but not frontal and global cognition (35). The third trial investigated the effect of the Mediterranean diet and a low-fat diet on cognitive performance compared with the waiting-list control diet in 155 participants from the UK with elevated cholesterol concentrations and showed an adverse effect of both the Mediterranean diet and the low-fat diet on attention after 12 wk of intervention (87). No effect of the Mediterranean diet on motor speed, memory, and choice reaction time was found compared with the control diet.

DASH diet
Observational evidence
The DASH diet in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, or AD was examined in 1 cross-sectional study (50) and 6 longitudinal studies (Table 4) (52–54, 69, 72, 79). Each 1-unit increase in DASH diet score was cross-sectionally associated with better verbal memory (β: 0.18; P = 0.018), but not with visual memory nor executive function or processing speed in US participants (n = 160) (50). Longitudinally, the highest quintile of DASH diet adherence was associated with a 28% lower risk of MCI (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.02; P-trend = 0.04) in US participants (n = 6425) after 9.11 y of follow-up (52). In addition, each 1-unit increase in DASH diet score was associated with less change in global cognition (β: 0.007; P = 0.03), episodic memory (β: 0.008; P = 0.04), and semantic memory (β: 0.009; P = 0.02) in US participants after 4.1 y of follow-up (n = 826) (54). Furthermore, adherence to the DASH diet was associated with better average cognition in US older adults (n = 3580) (mean differenceQ5vs.Q1: 0.97; P-trend = 0.0001), but not with cognitive decline after 10.6 y of follow-up (69). In 2 other studies including US (n = 16,144) (72) and Swedish (n = 2223) (79) participants no association was found after 4.1 y and ≤10.6 y of follow-up.

In the only longitudinal study on AD in US participants (n = 923) a 39% lower risk was shown for highest DASH diet adherence (HRT3vs.T1: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.97; P-trend = 0.07), whereas in this study somewhat stronger inverse associations were shown for the Mediterranean and MIND diets (53).

Trial evidence
A randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of the DASH diet on cognition in US adults over 4 mo (n = 124) (Table 3) (58). Psychomotor function significantly improved among participants assigned to the DASH diet alone (Cohen's D: 0.440; P = 0.036) and among those assigned to the DASH diet with additional weight management (Cohen's D: 0.480; P = 0.023), where the control group consumed their usual diet. However, whereas the DASH diet with additional weight management significantly improved executive function, memory, and learning (Cohen's D: 0.562; P = 0.008), no such effect was observed for the DASH diet alone.

MIND diet
Observational evidence
In 1 cross-sectional (57) and 5 longitudinal (11, 53, 73, 75, 79) studies the MIND diet was investigated in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, or AD (Table 5). Higher adherence to the MIND diet was cross-sectionally associated with better cognitive performance (global cognition score 15.6 ± 0.09 and 14.9 ± 0.10 in the highest and lowest tertile of MIND diet score, respectively; P-trend < 0.001) and a 35% lower risk of poor cognitive performance (ORT3vs.T1: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.86; P = 0.001) among US adults (n = 5907) (57). Longitudinally, the association of the MIND diet with cognitive decline was investigated in 3 studies in Swedish older adults (n = 2223) (79) and US adults (n = 960 and n = 16,058) (11, 73). Higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with less cognitive decline in Swedish older adults (n = 2223) after 6 y of follow-up (79). In addition, in 1 study including US adults (n = 960), higher MIND diet adherence was significantly associated with less cognitive decline after 4.7 y of follow-up in all 5 measured cognitive domains, including episodic memory (β: 0.0090; P = 0.001), semantic memory (β: 0.0113; P < 0.0001), visuospatial ability (β: 0.0077; P = 0.002), perceptual speed (β: 0.0097; P < 0.0001), and working memory (β: 0.0060; P = 0.01) (11). Higher MIND diet score was also associated with less global cognitive decline (β: 0.0106; P < 0.0001; βT3vsT1: 0.0366; P = 0.01) with a stronger inverse association for the MIND diet compared with the Mediterranean (P for MIND compared with MeDi = 0.02) and DASH diet (P for MIND compared with DASH = 0.02) (11). No association between the MIND diet and cognitive decline was observed in US older nurses after 12.9 y of follow-up (n = 16,058) (73).

A longitudinal study in Australian older adults (n = 1220) showed a 53% lower risk of cognitive impairment, which included both MCI and dementia, for highest MIND diet adherence (ORT3vs.T1: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.91; P-trend = 0.026) (75). In the only longitudinal study that investigated AD, a 53% lower risk was found for highest MIND diet adherence (HRT3vs.T1: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.76) in US adults (n = 923) after 4.5 y of follow-up (53). In addition, a 35% lower AD risk was shown for moderate MIND diet adherence (HRT3vs.T1: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.98), whereas for moderate adherence to the Mediterranean and DASH diets no significant association with AD was shown.

Evidence for the association of the dietary components of the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets with cognitive decline, dementia, and AD is discussed below and presented in Table 6.

Dietary components
Fish and ω-3
Fish consumption was cross-sectionally associated with a lower risk of dementia (39) and better attention (84), but not with global cognition (38, 39, 74, 84), visual memory (84), executive function (84), episodic verbal memory (38), working memory (38), or a lower risk of MCI (56, 84). In 2 (64, 79) of 12 (34, 41–43, 64, 66, 69, 75, 76, 79, 81, 83) longitudinal studies, fish consumption was associated with better subjective cognitive function and less cognitive decline; 1 study showed an increased risk of MCI, mild cognitive disorder, and cognitive decline (76). Another longitudinal study demonstrated an association between fish consumption and less cognitive decline for participants aged ≥65 y (83).

Plant-based foods
In 1 cross-sectional study the consumption of plant foods in general was examined, showing no association with self-reported cognitive function (74). In 2 (56, 84) of 4 (38, 39, 56, 84) cross-sectional studies an association between vegetable consumption and better cognitive function was shown; vegetable consumption was associated with better visual memory (84) and a lower risk of MCI (56). Longitudinally, vegetable consumption was associated with better subjective cognitive function and less cognitive decline in 3 (41, 64, 66) of 12 studies (34, 41, 43, 64, 66, 67, 69, 75, 76, 79, 81, 83); 1 study showed a higher risk of MCI, but not of mild cognitive disorder or cognitive decline (76). Green leafy vegetables specifically were not associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment in a longitudinal study (75). Olive oil consumption was associated with better cognitive function or less cognitive decline for at least some cognitive domains in 2 (38, 84) of 3 (38, 39, 84) cross-sectional studies and 2 (34, 48) of 3 (34, 42, 48) longitudinal studies. Results on vegetable oil and seed oils are mixed, showing inverse (79) as well as adverse associations (42). Nut consumption, specifically walnut consumption, was cross-sectionally associated with better cognitive function (38). Longitudinally, nut consumption in general was associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of cognitive impairment in 3 (64, 69, 75) of 9 (34, 41, 43, 64, 66, 67, 69, 75, 83) studies. Legume intake, examined in 4 cross-sectional (38, 39, 56, 84) and 12 longitudinal (34, 41, 43, 64, 66, 67, 69, 75, 76, 79, 81, 83) studies, was associated with better cognitive function in only 1 longitudinal study (69). Fruit consumption was not associated with cognitive function in cross-sectional studies (38, 39, 56, 84). In 1 (64) of 11 (34, 41, 43, 64, 66, 67, 69, 76, 79, 81, 83) longitudinal studies, fruit consumption was associated with better subjective cognitive function, but in another longitudinal study fruit consumption was associated with a higher risk of MCI. Consumption of berries specifically was not associated with cognitive impairment in a longitudinal study (75). No association between potatoes and cognitive function was observed in 2 cross-sectional studies (39, 84) and 1 longitudinal study (81). Urinary polyphenol excretion, a biomarker of dietary polyphenol intake, was associated with better immediate episodic verbal memory in a cross-sectional study, but results for delayed episodic verbal memory were mixed (38).

Meat
Meat consumption in general was associated with worse cognitive function on at least some domains in 1 (38) of 2 (38, 84) cross-sectional studies and 1 (81) of 7 (34, 41, 43, 69, 75, 76, 81) longitudinal studies. Red meat consumption specifically was associated with worse executive function in 1 (84) of 3 (39, 74, 84) cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal studies investigating red and processed meat did not show an association with cognitive decline (64, 66, 67, 69, 79, 83). The consumption of poultry was not associated with cognitive function in 3 cross-sectional studies (39, 74, 84), but was associated with less cognitive decline in 1 (79) of 2 (75, 79) longitudinal studies.

Grains and cereals
Grain and cereal consumption together was not associated with risk of MCI in a cross-sectional study (56). Cereal consumption was associated with worse cognitive function on at least some cognitive domains in 1 (38) of 2 (38, 74) cross-sectional and 1 (76) of 6 (34, 41, 43, 64, 76, 81) longitudinal studies, whereas the consumption of nonrefined cereals specifically was associated with better cognitive function in 1 (39) of 2 (39, 84) cross-sectional studies. Grain consumption, specifically refined grains, was associated with more cognitive decline in 1 (79) of 3 (69, 75, 79) longitudinal studies, but whole grain consumption was associated with better average performance on at least some cognitive domains in 2 (67, 69) of 4 (66, 67, 69, 83) longitudinal studies.

Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
MUFA:SFA ratio was cross-sectionally associated with an increased risk of nonamnestic MCI (56), whereas an association with less cognitive decline was shown in 3 (34, 66, 67) of 9 (34, 41, 43, 45, 64, 66, 67, 69, 76) longitudinal studies. Results for consumption of MUFA or PUFA were mixed, with 1 longitudinal study showing a beneficial association with cognitive decline (45) and other longitudinal studies showing adverse associations (42, 76). A higher (MUFA + PUFA):SFA ratio was associated with a lower risk of MCI, and specifically amnestic MCI, in a cross-sectional study (56). No associations for SFA intake (42, 45, 76), PUFA:SFA ratio (81), or unsaturated fatty acid to SFA ratio (45) with cognitive decline were found.

Dairy
Dairy consumption was associated with worse cognitive function on at least some cognitive domains in 1 (84) of 5 (38, 39, 56, 74, 84) cross-sectional studies and 1 (79) of 8 (34, 41, 43, 64, 69, 76, 79, 83) longitudinal studies. In addition, dairy consumption was associated with a higher risk of MCI and mild neurocognitive disorder in a longitudinal study (76). No association between cheese consumption and cognitive impairment was observed in a longitudinal study (75). Consumption of milk, specifically high-fat milk, was associated with more cognitive decline in 1 (79) of 3 longitudinal (64, 79, 81) studies. In the same study margarine consumption was shown to be associated with more cognitive decline, but no association between consumption of ice cream and cognitive decline was observed (79).

Alcohol
Alcohol consumption was not associated with cognitive function in 4 cross-sectional (38, 39, 56, 84) and 9 longitudinal (34, 41, 43, 64, 66, 67, 76, 81, 83) studies. Wine consumption specifically was associated with better global cognition and less cognitive decline in 1 cross-sectional study (38) and 1 (45) of 2 (45, 75) longitudinal studies. The consumption of spirits or beers was not associated with cognitive decline in a longitudinal study (79).

Other dietary components
The consumption of sugar or fruit juice was associated with more cognitive decline in a longitudinal study (79), but intake of carbohydrates or sweetened beverages in general was not associated with cognitive decline in 2 other longitudinal studies (45, 69). No association between the consumption of fiber (45), sodium (69), processed and fast fried food (75), sweets and pastries (75), or animal-source cooking fat (83) and cognitive decline or cognitive impairment was shown longitudinally.

Discussion
The evidence summarized in this review suggests that higher adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets is associated with less cognitive decline and a lower risk of AD, which is mainly based on observational evidence. The number of studies examining the impact of the studied diets on dementia risk are scarce and too inconclusive to draw any conclusions. When comparing the potential impact of the different diets in respect to cognitive decline and AD, data suggest stronger inverse associations for the MIND diet compared with the Mediterranean and DASH diets (11, 53, 75). Moreover, inverse associations tend to be stronger for the Mediterranean diet with AD than the DASH diet (53). Compared with previous studies in this research field, the current review particularly included more studies on the recently developed MIND diet.

Due to methodological differences between the included studies, i.e. study design and study population, dietary assessment methodology, and outcome measurement, the overall results should be interpreted with care.

With respect to the study design and study population, the majority of the included studies were observational studies (50/56 studies), which are known to be prone to reverse causation, potential confounding, and over adjustment (88–90). To illustrate the case of reverse causation, it is likely that participants living with dementia or cognitive decline included in a cross-sectional study report less foods than they actually consumed (88, 91). In addition, the possibility of residual confounding has to be considered, as many observational studies did not adjust for one or more potential confounders, such as APOE ε4 allele, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, CVD risk factors, depression, comorbidities or medication, smoking, energy intake, BMI or obesity, physical activity, cognitive or social activity, or the use of nutritional supplements. On the other hand, the inclusion of potential intermediates may have led to over adjustment and as such to attenuation of existing true associations. Namely, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with hypertension (92), which, in turn, is associated with cerebrovascular health (93). As such, hypertension may be an intermediate pathway explaining the potential effect of the diet on cognitive decline, warranting careful modeling. Cohort-specific characteristics, e.g. age of assessment, education, sex, race, vascular risk, follow-up duration, loss to follow-up, or community dwelling compared with diagnosed with dementia, may also be responsible for differences in outcomes. For instance, in several studies, a beneficial association of the Mediterranean diet with cognitive decline was only shown for part of the study population, namely participants aged ≥65 y (83), African-American participants (65), or men (40), which limits the external validity. The 4 trials on the effect of the Mediterranean and DASH diets on cognition, dementia, or AD that were included in this review also had several limitations, including lack of baseline outcome measurements, small sample size, and relatively short duration of intervention, so no firm conclusion could be drawn from these trials.

With respect to the dietary assessment methodology, most observational studies used an FFQ and some studies used a food diary or 24-h recall (24hR). FFQs and 24hRs are known to be prone to recall bias related to memory deficits, especially in studies with elderly, cognitively impaired participants, or low-educated participants (94). Compared with 24hRs, FFQs are more limited with respect to the variety of foods assessed but often more likely to reflect the usual intake. As food diaries are usually completed during a day, they are more likely to affect eating behavior than FFQs and recalls. Besides these differences between the methods, they are all prone to measurement error related to socially desirable answers and errors in food composition tables. Differences in exposure quantification also arose from the scoring system applied to calculate adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets. Most studies examining the impact of the Mediterranean diet used the original score as described by Trichopoulou et al. (9) or the alternate Mediterranean diet score as described by Panagiotakos et al. (30). The original Mediterranean diet score is based on the median intake of the population, does not consider extremes in intake, and includes MUFA:SFA ratio instead of olive oil intake (9). As such, the statistical power may be limited in studies in non-Mediterranean countries. The score by Panagiotakos et al. uses predefined cut-offs for intake, divides intake into quintiles, and includes intake of olive oil specifically (30). DASH diet adherence was calculated by using the score by Fung et al. (32), or the score by Folsom et al. (31). Compared with the score of Folsom et al. (31), the score of Fung et al. (32) is based on relatively few dietary components. In addition, the score of Fung et al. (32) is based on intake of the study population. Finally, irrespective of the diet under study, not all studies were able to 1) capture all dietary components when constructing the dietary pattern score and 2) distinguish between dietary components in the same way (e.g. total cereal intake compared with unrefined cereals). The differences in effect sizes between the diets may for instance be explained by the absence of olive oil in the DASH diet, as olive oil was associated with better cognitive function and less cognitive decline (34, 38, 48, 84). Besides nutrition, the Mediterranean diet pyramid also includes other cultural and lifestyle factors including conviviality, culinary activities, physical activity, and adequate rest (17). Of these, physical activity and social network, which is related to conviviality, have been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia (95). In addition, daytime napping, which is related to adequate rest, has been shown to improve alertness and performance (96).

With respect to the outcome measure, several studies only used a global screening tool, such as the MMSE, Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS), Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS), or seven-minute screen (7MS), whereas other studies applied multiple cognitive tests. A global screening tool may be less sensitive to detect possible associations due to a potential ceiling effect (97), so studies using global screening tools may be more likely to present null-associations. Nevertheless, overall, the results of studies using a global screening tool were rather similar to the results of studies using multiple cognitive tests. In addition, 4 longitudinal studies did not assess cognitive status at baseline, which may have led to residual confounding due to interindividual differences in cognitive function or brain volume. Conversely, including baseline outcome measurements may also lead to an overestimation of the effects due to the possibility of a learning effect with an even larger effect with an increasing number of repetitions.

Investigating the role of nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns in relation to dementia is important as there is no cure for dementia yet. A focus on whole dietary patterns is useful as the effect of a combination of nutrients may be larger than the effect of single nutrients and because possible interactions between nutrients are incorporated. Many observational studies have already examined the Mediterranean diet in relation to cognitive decline, dementia, or AD, but more observational studies on the DASH and MIND diets are recommended. In addition, the number of intervention studies investigating either the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diet is very limited, so more intervention studies on each of these dietary patterns are needed. In the United States, an intervention study on the effect of the MIND diet on cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and vascular dementia is ongoing (98). Furthermore, both observational and intervention studies examining the association of the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets with brain structure are recommended, because these studies may provide insights into the exact mechanisms via which the 3 dietary patterns may protect against cognitive decline, dementia, and AD. For example, adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with less decline in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and less increase in Pittsburgh compound B in AD-affected regions (99). Moreover, future trials could examine all 3 dietary patterns simultaneously, because this would provide interesting insights into whether the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diet is most protective against cognitive decline, dementia, and AD. However, it may be easier for people to change the intake of one nutrient or food than to change their whole diet. Therefore, despite the shift of research from single nutrients and foods towards whole dietary patterns, research on specific nutrients or foods is still useful. An interesting field of study is to investigate the role of olive oil in cognitive decline, dementia, and AD via both observational and intervention studies as this may be one of the most important components driving the association of the Mediterranean and MIND diets with less cognitive decline. Last of all, future research should, if possible, take into account the methodological issues described above.

Conclusions
The results of this review suggest that higher adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets is associated with less cognitive decline and a lower risk of AD, as demonstrated by 10 out of 14 cross-sectional studies, 1 case-control study, 21 out of 33 longitudinal studies, and 4 out of 6 articles on intervention studies. Evidence for an association with dementia was inconsistent. Observational studies indicate that the MIND diet may be more protective against cognitive decline and AD than the Mediterranean and DASH diets (11, 53, 75), but more evidence on the MIND diet is required to draw a firm conclusion. Furthermore, the Mediterranean diet seems more protective against AD than the DASH diet (53). Based on the studies included in the current review, in which dietary components were assessed as part of 1 of the 3 dietary patterns, olive oil consumption seems to be an important component underlying these associations (34, 38, 48, 84).
