We
report an entirely new class of printed electrical gas sensors
that are produced at near “zero cost”. This technology
exploits the intrinsic hygroscopic properties of cellulose fibers
within paper; although it feels and looks dry, paper contains substantial
amount of moisture, adsorbed from the environment, enabling the use
of wet chemical methods for sensing without manually adding water
to the substrate. The sensors exhibit high sensitivity to water-soluble
gases (e.g., lower limit of detection for NH3 < 200
parts-per-billion) with a fast and reversible response. The sensors
show comparable or better performance (especially at high relative
humidity) than most commercial ammonia sensors at a fraction of their
price (<$0.02 per sensor). We demonstrate that the sensors proposed
can be integrated into food packaging to monitor freshness (to reduce
food waste and plastic pollution) or implemented into near-field-communication
tags to function as wireless, battery-less gas sensors that can be
interrogated with smartphones.

==== Body
Food waste
is a major global
problem with substantial economic and environmental consequences;1 30% of all food produced for human consumption
(∼1.3 billion tons) is thrown away each year.2 Although this number arises from various inefficiencies
throughout the entire supply chain, food waste by consumers is a major
contributor.3 In the United Kingdom, for
instance, food waste by households amounts to 7 million tons every
year, 60% of which (4.2 million tons, worth $12.5 billion) is estimated
to be safe to consume, yet discarded by consumers.4

The freshness of packaged foods is estimated by the
use-by date
that appears on the packaging. The use-by date is an approximation
for the date on which a perishable product may no longer be edible.
However, this does not reflect the actual state of freshness of the
consumable, because it is dependent on, in addition to formulation
and packaging, the storage and processing conditions.5 More than one third of consumers throw away food solely
because it is close to (or passed) the use-by date, regardless of
its actual freshness. Inefficient consumption of food produces significant
plastic pollution. This is another dimension to the issue of discarding
food prematurely that has catastrophic environmental consequences,
yet it is often overlooked.6

A more
precise alternative to the use-by dates is the integration
of disposable sensors in the packaging (this concept is known as intelligent/smart
packaging).7−10 Sensors can help monitor the state of perishable foods and communicate
their condition to the user in real time. Such technologies range
from relatively simple and qualitative temperature–time indicators
to sophisticated and quantitative chemical monitors that measure the
decomposition gases in packaged foods.11−17 Despite the overwhelming advantages of smart packaging, retailers
and manufacturers are not willing to include freshness sensors into
the food packaging for four reasons:18(i) The existing solutions
are not commercially
viable, because they increase the cost of packaging by more than 100%.

(ii) Integration of sensors
into packaging
requires complex fabrication processes.

(iii) Most low-cost solutions are colorimetric
indicators that are subjective (not everyone sees colors the same),
difficult to use, and, at best, semiquantitative.

(iv) Existing solutions are not fully
compatible with digital platforms—i.e., the output generated
is not electrical and/or cannot be digitized easily.

To be commercially viable, a spoilage sensor must be nondestructive,
easy to use, flexible (most packaging has curved surfaces), compatible
with packaging technologies, and most importantly, ultra low cost
(practically zero cost). Furthermore, the sensor should ideally be
biodegradable or contain only nontoxic materials (no metals, semiconductors,
etc.) to prevent contamination of food and reduce/eliminate environmental
impact.19

We propose a highly sensitive,
eco-friendly, near-zero-cost, paper-based,
electrical gas sensor (PEGS) technology for the sensing of water-soluble
gases such as ammonia, trimethylamine, carbon dioxide, etc. at room
temperature (i.e., without heating). Paper is often used as a carrier
substrate for other materials, such as carbon nanotubes, to detect
gases.20 However, our approach for sensing
gases is entirely different to the existing methods; we exploit the
intrinsic hygroscopic characteristics of cellulose paper to create
a truly low-cost device. Highly hygroscopic cellulose fibers within
paper contain a substantial amount of moisture adsorbed on their surface
from the environment. Although cellulose paper feels and looks dry,
it is always wet. In fact, at a relative humidity (RH) of 50%, paper
contains ∼5% water by weight (water content of paper varies
with RH; see Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information (SI)). This phenomenon enables the use of wet chemical
methods for the sensing of water-soluble gases.21,22 The electrical properties of the thin film of water adsorbed on
the cellulose fibers within paper can be probed by measuring the electrical
impedance (or simply conductance) of paper using two graphite electrodes
printed on the surface of paper. When a water-soluble gas is present
in the immediate surrounding of paper, it increases the ionic conductance
of paper. These additional ions come from the dissociation of water-soluble
gases in the surface-bound thin film of water.

We have applied
the PEGS technology to quantitatively monitor the
freshness of packaged foods through sensing of spoilage gases, primarily
focusing on meat products such as fish and poultry. We have cross-validated
the results obtained from PEGS for monitoring spoilage with conventional
microbiological testing (i.e., bacterial cultures). Finally, we demonstrated
that the sensors produced can be integrated into near-field communication
(NFC) tags to function as on/off-type disposal sensing devices for
detecting gases wirelessly from within packaging, using a smartphone.

Sensor
Fabrication
We fabricated the PEGS by printing
interdigitated carbon electrodes on Whatman Chromatography 1 cellulose
paper (manufactured by General Electric Healthcare), using a ballpoint
pen and a cutter plotter (Figure 1A). We used a commercial carbon ink, which was diluted
with a propriety solvent (both materials sourced from Gwent Electronic
Materials, UK) with an ink-to-solvent ratio of 55:45 by weight, to
improve printability. This method of fabrication allows for rapid
prototyping and precise digital adjustment of various design parameters–e.g.
surface area, size, number of interdigitated fingers, and the amount
of ink deposited to tailor performance characteristics. Figures 1B and 1C show top and cross-sectional optical images of the sensors produced.
Surface areas of the interdigitated electrodes, and the spacing between
them, are the main factors determining the overall impedance of the
sensors, which have a critical effect on its sensitivity. We used
a transimpedance amplifier (Figure S2 in
the SI) to convert the electrical output of PEGS (the current running
through the sensor) to a voltage signal to enable digitization of
the analog signal, using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on a
microcontroller. When the base impedance of the paper sensor is high,
the current running through the sensor is low; therefore, the signal
must be amplified, which, in turn, results in higher sensitivity to
gases since the absolute electrical contribution to ionic conductivity
by a gas is the same whether the sensor has a lower or higher base
impedance (see the section entitled “Modeling
of Sensing Mechanism”, presented later in this work).
On the other hand, there are limitations to the maximum impedance
that can be used for sensing, because it becomes increasingly difficult
to build low-cost electronics for signal amplification without a decrease
in signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, a degree of optimization is required
to produce a sensitive, yet cost-effective system.

Figure 1 (A) Fabrication of paper-based
electrical gas sensors (PEGS). Carbon
electrodes are printed on Whatman Chromatography 1 cellulose paper
with a ballpoint pen and cutter plotter, allowing rapid prototyping
in the desired geometry. Once printed, the sensors are cut and placed
inside a card-edge connector for characterization. (B) Top view of
a single PEGS consisting of two electrodes with three fingers and
a spacing of 1 mm between each finger. (C) Cross-sectional view of
a PEGS across three fingers (red dashed line in panel (B)). Carbon
ink (black) partially penetrates paper (white).

The carbon electrodes printed on paper had a typical resistance
of 6.40 ± 2.75 kΩ/□ (n = 7). This
is several orders of magnitude lower than the impedance of paper (10
MΩ to several GΩ); therefore, the contribution of the
electrode resistance to the overall impedance of paper is negligible.
Throughout the experiments, we did not alter the electrical characteristics
of the carbon electrodes, but, nevertheless, the resistance of the
electrodes can be modified using multiple passes of the ballpoint
pen.

Results and Discussion
Sensor Characterization
We measured
the impedance of
paper between the interdigitated electrodes to determine the conductance
of PEGS when exposed to water-soluble gases. All calibration experiments
were performed after flushing the sensors in the test chamber with
humidified nitrogen for at least 1 h. We tested the sensors against
ammonia (NH3), trimethylamine (TMA), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and carbon monoxide (CO).
Each test gas, diluted in high purity N2 to a known concentration
by the supplier, was purchased from the BOC Group PLC and further
mixed with humidified and dry nitrogen at different ratios to adjust
RH (35%–95%) and concentration (0.2–106 parts-per-million
[ppm]) to the level desired for the experiments. To measure the response
of the sensors to a target gas, we applied sinusoidal excitation at
various frequencies (10–103 Hz) and amplitudes (0.1–10
V) as the input signal. We calculated the conductance (G) of the sensor using Ohm’s law by dividing the current passing
through the sensor by the applied potential. We determined the baseline
conductance of PEGS at the set RH levels when no test gas was present,
e.g., in pure (humidified) nitrogen atmosphere (G0). Using G and G0, we calculated the change in conductance of paper sensors
(ΔG/G0) in response
to the test gas.

The PEGS exhibited a high intrinsic selectivity
toward ammonia, compared to the other gases tested (TMA, H2S, CO2, CO) (see Figure 2A). PEGS were more than 20 times more sensitive to
NH3, compared to TMA and CO2, while both CO
(below 103 ppm) and H2S (below 104 ppm) were undetectable by the sensors. Figure 2B shows the response of the sensor (ΔG/G0) when exposed to a wide
range of ammonia concentrations (0.2–1000 ppm). The change
in conductance was proportional to the ammonia concentration, with
a lower limit of detection of ∼0.2 ppm (Figure 2C) at ∼70% RH. Note that the threshold
for the detection of ammonia by the human nose is ∼50 ppm,
although this may be dependent on the individual.23,24 The response of PEGS for ammonia can be approximated by two separate
linear regions across the lower (0.2–2 ppm) and higher (2–103 ppm) range of concentrations (Figure
S3 in the SI). The sensors were more sensitive to ammonia in
the range of 0.2–2 ppm than 2–103 ppm, as
indicated by the slopes of the fitted (linear) lines (0.24 vs 1.1),
probably because of the change in concentration of ionic species due
to increasing pH.25

70% RH. (B) Response of PEGS to varying concentrations of ammonia

of PEGS to 80 ppm of ammonia with arrows indicating tON/OFF values for 90% of the target level.

Regardless of the ammonia concentration, the sensors
reached their
final decile of ΔG/G0 within 186 ± 7 s (tON, n = 5). Immediately after ammonia was replaced by pure nitrogen, G decreased to 10% of its original peak value within 163
± 9 s (tOFF, n =
5). Both tON and tOFF values were similar to those of commercially available
electrochemical ammonia sensors such as the EUROGAS 4-NH3-100 ammonia
sensor, with a tON/OFF value of <90
s (Figure 2D). We investigated
the impact of environmental (e.g., temperature and RH) and operational
(e.g., amplitude and frequency) parameters on the response of the
sensors. At different temperatures within the range of 20–30
°C and at 60% RH, we exposed the sensors to 5 ppm ammonia (Figure 3A). In this range,
the temperature shows no effect on the response of the sensors. However,
the temperature does have an influence on gas solubility and ionic
mobility in solution. Therefore, we assume that the effect in the
temperature range tested is small and lies within the error bars.
RH had a positive impact on sensitivity; for instance, when exposed
to 5 ppm ammonia (10 V, 10 Hz), the sensor response (ΔG/G0) increased from 1% for
RH ≈ 37% to ∼4% at RH ≈ 60%. For RH above 60%,
no further change in ΔG/G0 was observed (Figure 3A). It has been suggested that the water adsorbed in paper
exists in three different states, depending on the RH value.26 At low RH (<30%), water forms a strongly
bound monolayer around the cellulose fibers. As the RH value increases
(30%–70%), more water is adsorbed on the surface of the fibers,
increasing the amount of water that is less strongly bound to the
surface. At RH > 70%, water is mainly present as free water in
paper,
which essentially behaves as bulk water. This agrees with the observed
behavior that, at high RH (>60%), no further change in ΔG/G0 is detected. In addition,
increasing RH reduces the base impedance and produces a better signal-to-noise
ratio, improving signal quality and hence sensitivity. In contrast,
the resistivity of paper decreases exponentially with RH, which negatively
impacts the performance of PEGS (see Figure S4 in the SI).

to 5 ppm ammonia, as a function of RH. For 60% RH, we tested at different
temperatures (20–30 °C). (B) Impact of peak-to-peak voltage

and the response of PEGS (n = 6) to 5 ppm ammonia.
(C) Sensor response (n = 6) to 5 ppm ammonia with
different frequencies of the applied sinusoidal potential. The data
point at 0 Hz frequency shows the sensor behavior with a DC signal
applied. Error bars indicate standard deviation in subplots A–C.
(D) The response of PEGS to 10 ppm of NH3 for three sensors
over nine consecutive exposure cycles (800 s) at 78% RH. The average
response of each sensor is shown as a dashed line, along with the
standard deviation. When averaged over all cycles for all three sensors,
the mean of the peak response is 10.71%, with a standard deviation
of 3.37% (n = 27).

Between the two operational factors we studied, the amplitude
of
the voltage applied (0.1–10 V, Figure 3B) had a larger impact on the quality (sensitivity
and standard deviation) of the output signal than the input signal
frequency (10–103 Hz; see Figure 3C). This was expected, since frequency dependence
of ionic conductivity (the Debye–Falkenhagen effect) is negligible
in this frequency range.27

At any
given RH, the PEGS produced a stable and repeatable electrical
response to ammonia (Figure 3D). We tested three separate sensors, where each was subjected
to nine consecutive cycles of ammonia (78% RH, 10 ppm ammonia, 800
s intervals, 3.3 V, 10 Hz) followed by nitrogen to remove ammonia
from the test chamber. Figure 3D shows the output of the sensors in which the dashed line
indicates the average peak reading for each sensor. For a total of
27 samples (3 sensors, 9 cycles of gas exposure each), we achieved
an average of 10.71% ± 3.37% standard deviation. Individual sensors
had a standard deviation of 0.47%–0.73%. The coefficient of
variation (COV)28 is <0.07 for individual
sensors and 0.32 for different sensors, which is within the acceptable
range for commercial applications (e.g., the EURO-GAS 4-NH3-100 ammonia
sensor has a COV of 0.26, the FIGARO TGS 826 MOS ammonia sensor has
a COV of 0.27; these values were obtained from the datasheets).

Modeling of Sensing Mechanism
When a water-soluble
gas such as ammonia (X(g)) is introduced to the atmosphere
of paper, it will partly dissolve (X(aq)) in the thin layer
of water present on the cellulose fibers within paper. Figure 4 illustrates the sensing mechanism
for an alkaline gas schematically, as an example. Depending on the
nature of the gas dissolved, further acidic or basic dissociation
reactions may occur, resulting in various charged species (X–/X+, H3O+/OH–):    

Figure 4 Model
of the sensing mechanism for an alkaline test gas (B(g)). The interconnected network of cellulose fibers within
paper is covered with a thin film of water (left). The water in the
paper is in equilibrium with the relative humidity (RH) and any gas
present. Reacting with water, the dissolved gas (B(aq))
dissociates to generate cations (BH +) and hydroxide anions
(OH–). The generation of additional ions directly
impacts the ionic conductivity, which is measured by applying an external
potential (E) across paper, using two carbon electrodes
and measuring the ionic current.

X– and X+ represent the negatively
and positively charged ions generated by the reactions between the
dissolved gas (X(aq)) and water. The additional ions produced
because of the gas water reaction impact the ionic conductivity of
paper. The amount of the impact is dependent on the concentration
of X(g) in the surrounding, immediate atmosphere. The increase
in conductivity (σ) due to dissociation of the target gas is
dependent on the ionic mobility (uion),
charge (Ze), and concentration of ions
(nion):  

These parameters are determined
by the nature of the target gas
(solubility (δH), dissociation constant (Kd), and mobility (u), in water)
and the partial pressure of the gas, pX, which is directly
related to the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere. At constant
RH and temperature, the amount of water adsorbed in paper remains
constant; hence, any change in impedance is caused only by the variation
in the concentration of gas in the surrounding atmosphere. Based on
our results, we propose that the concentration of ammonia in atmosphere,
for example, can be determined by measuring the elevated ionic conductivity
due to the additional ammonium (NH4+) and hydroxide
(OH–) ions generated from the dissociation of ammonia
in water:    

Ammonia has one of the highest Henry’s law solubility
constants
(kHθ) of all gases (kHθ = 67.75 ± 10.90 mol/(kg
bar) at 25 °C), with an equilibrium water reaction constant of
1.79 × 10–5 at 25 °C.29 Therefore, minute amounts of ammonia in the atmosphere
can substantially elevate ionic concentrations, which can be detected
through electrical impedance measurements.

The lower sensitivity
of the PEGS to other water-soluble gases
such as CO2, CO, H2S, or TMA is explained by
their different levels of dissociation, solubility, and ion mobility
in water. Both NH3 and TMA are nitrogenous bases and are
readily protonated to generate ammonium and trimethylammonium cations.
In contrast, CO2 and H2S are acidic, and, in
water, they dissociate to generate anionic species. CO does not react
with water at room temperature. The aqueous solubility and dissociation
constants of TMA, CO, CO2, and H2S are significantly
lower than ammonia in water (see Table S1 in the SI). Among the gases we tested, ammonia has the highest water
solubility followed by TMA, while the solubilities of H2S, CO, and CO2 are ∼2000 times lower. For example,
0.2 ppm gaseous ammonia (NH3(g)) yields a 2.8 mM ammonia
solution, if in contact with bulk water.30 This solution will contain 0.2 mM of solvated (neutral) ammonia
(NH3(aq)) and 2.6 mM ammonium (NH4+) at pH 8. At this ionic concentration, the ionic conductivity of
water increases by ∼3 orders of magnitude, from ∼10–7 S cm–1 to 10–4 S cm–1. This 1000-fold increase in conductivity
is detectable by the PEGS. CO2, on the other hand, has
a low solubility in water, meaning that even at a concentration of
10 000 ppm, the concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3–) in water is only ∼4.4 × 10–5 mM. Such low ionic concentrations do not produce a measurable signal.
The calculations based on the solubility, dissociation, and mobility
of a gaseous analyte and its ions provide a sufficiently accurate
model to estimate (within 1 order of magnitude) the response of the
sensor to a target gas. Generally, however, more factors may be included
to allow for more accurate predictions (for further discussions on
the accuracy of the model presented, please see section SI–P1 in the SI).

Quantitative Monitoring
of Food Spoilage
We used PEGS
to nondestructively monitor spoilage of meat products (fish and poultry)
and cross-validated the results with conventional microbiological
cultures to demonstrate the suitability of PEGS in smart packaging.
When monitoring the decomposition of fresh meats, PEGS act as a sensor
of total-volatile-basic-nitrogen (TVB-N). Ample amounts of TVB-N are
produced when meat products decay. Because of this, TVB-N testing
may be used as an index to assess the quality of meat products, including
fish.31 The main components of TVB-N are
NH3 and the related TMA and DMA (dimethylamine), where
three or two of the H atoms of ammonia are substituted by methyl groups,
respectively. In contact with water, all three gases behave similarly:
First, they partly dissolve in water, according to Henry’s
law,32 then dissociate into ions and change
the ionic strength of the solution. By measuring the ionic strength
of the solution, it is possible to determine the level of TVB-N and
estimate the freshness of meat. Some attempts have been made to exploit
this concept for developing food sensors; yet, the prototypes that
have been developed thus far are cumbersome, expensive, and not compatible
with flexible packaging and industrial manufacturing processes.33

As shown above, PEGS can sensitively detect
ammonia and TMA (and probably DMA, although we did not test it), which
are two of the most important gases involved in the decomposition
of food of animal origin. Although the ionic conductivity of paper
changes with both varying levels of RH and water-soluble gases, the
RH inside a package of fresh meat reaches equilibrium and remains
constant at ∼100% RH. Hence, any increase in conductance of
paper is due to the decomposition gases and not the RH, since the
RH value is constant. To accelerate reaching equilibrium with the
∼100% RH inside packaging, we added 20 μL of deionized
(DI) water to each PEGS (see the Experimental Section for more information). We placed a total of 12 paper sensors in
six separate sealed plastic boxes (two sensors per box), each with
a volume of 180 mL, to monitor microbial spoilage of fish and poultry:
the first two boxes contained 40 g fillets of cod, the second set
of two boxes contained lean chicken breast (20 g), and the last set
of two boxes contained DI water as a control (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). Using our custom
electronics, we simultaneously recorded the impedance of each sensor
placed inside the boxes at room temperature (potential applied: sinusoidal,
10 V, 10 Hz). We normalized the signal response to relative change
in percentage per 100 g of fish/chicken (ΔG/G0 [100 g]−1). This
allows comparison between different amounts of meat. The PEGS in the
box containing only DI water showed little to no change in their response
throughout the entire duration of the experiment. In comparison to
the control experiment with only DI water, the PEGS in the containers
with fish and poultry exhibited a >900% increase in sensor response
over the course of the experiments (see Figures 5A and 5B). This increase
is due to the gases released by the decaying meat. To monitor spoilage
gases at a lower storage temperature (4 °C), we placed three
containers (two with a 35 g fillet of cod and two sensors in each
container, and another containing DI water and two sensors as control)
inside a household refrigerator (Beko, Model LSG1545) and used PEGS
to measure the change in conductance over 10 days (Figure 5C). Over the course of the
10-day experiment, while the response of PEGS in the container with
DI water remained steady around the baseline, the response of PEGS
in the containers with cod increased by more than 1000%. This indicates
that the sensors can detect decomposition at both room and lower temperatures.

response is normalized to 100 g of meat. (A) Response of PEGS (n = 4) to decaying chicken breast at room temperature and
water as control (n = 2) over 72 h. The colored bands

determined by microbial cultures shown in graph D. (B) Response of

of PEGS (n = 4) to decaying fillet of cod and water

The colored bands correspond to the healthy limit of microbial contamination
which was determined by microbial cultures shown in graph D. Using
this approach, a use-by date was estimated to be ∼4–5
days after purchase. (D) Bacterial counts for the meats monitored
at room temperature. A count of 108–109 colony-forming units per gram (cfu g–1) corresponds
to a limit of healthy consumption.

We have cross-validated the increasing electrical response,
produced
by PEGS due to spoilage, with microbiological assays every 24 h (Figure 5D).34 The critical threshold of bacterial concentration at which
most categories of food is considered spoiled, is around 108–109 CFU g–1 (colony-forming
units per gram).35 From the microbiological
data, we approximated the critical time (tc) at which the microbial count (normalized per mass) exceeded 108–109 CFU g–1. At room
temperature, for samples of fish, tc was
∼10 h while for chicken breast, tc was 70 h (shaded bands in Figure 5D). We correlated the readings from PEGS to tc for fish and chicken and estimated a threshold
for safe consumption in terms of ΔG/G0 [100 g]−1. While the threshold
for fish was ∼400%, it was 1200% for chicken (shaded bands
in Figures 5A and 5B). Because the sensor’s response does not
change significantly with temperature (see Figure 3A), we used the 400% threshold value for
fish obtained through experiments at room temperature to estimate
that the product would no longer be safe for consumption after 4–5
days when stored at 4 °C in the refrigerator (Figure 5C). For the fresh fish product
used in this carefully designed experiment, the use-by date issued
by the manufacturer was also consistent with our experimental results.
Please see section SI–P2 and Figure S6 in the SI for more details on the analysis of the spoilage data.

Integration of Paper Sensors in NFC Tags
To realize
on/off-type low-cost wireless gas sensors that can be interrogated
using a smartphone, we integrated PEGS into a commercial NFC tag.
We bypassed the silicon-based integrated circuit (IC) on the tag with
a resistor and a PEGS (Figure 6).36 As a reader, we used an NFC
enabled smartphone (HUAWEI P9) to probe the tag. With the NFC tag
modified with PEGS, we monitored the presence of NH3 in
a sealed box wirelessly, to simulate a food package that contains
a decaying food. In this configuration, if no ammonia gas is present
inside the box, the reader (i.e., smartphone) can communicate with
the tag as it receives enough power to turn on, indicating that there
is no detectable gas in the box (Movie S1). However, the tag fails to communicate with the smartphone when
15 mL of 10% ammonia solution is injected into the box which indicates
the presence of detectable amounts of gas inside the sealed environment.
We can tailor the switching point, at which the communication is stopped,
by changing the parallel resistor, depending on the application.

PEGS that bypasses the integrated circuit (IC) attached to the tag.
In the circuit diagram (bottom), the original circuit components (IC),
a capacitor (Ctag) and the antenna (Ltag) are
shown in black. Our modifications are highlighted in red: resistor
(R1) and a PEGS with resistance Rp and capacitance Cp. The modifications
disrupt communication between the reader and tag once a certain amount
of gas (in this case, ammonia) is present. The resistor R1 is used to adjust the concentration threshold at which the tag stops
working. (B) Photograph of a working tag when no ammonia is present

Conclusions
We presented an entirely new class of near-zero-cost,
electrical,
gas sensors that can quantitatively detect the level of water-soluble
gases in the atmosphere, using cellulose paper as the sensing material.
Among the gases we tested (i.e., CO, CO2, H2S, TMA, NH3), PEGS were most sensitive to ammonia, because
of its high solubility in water. PEGS exhibited comparable or better
performance in terms of the lower limit of detection, response time,
sensitivity and cross-sensitivity, than commercially available low-cost
ammonia sensors, while requiring no heating or complex manufacturing
processes/materials. PEGS are particularly suitable for operation
at high RH (90%–100%), where many existing sensing technologies
(e.g., metal-oxide semiconductor,37,38 electrochemical)39 cannot operate (optimally or at all). In fact,
PEGS perform the best, in terms of sensitivity, at RH > 60%. In
this
work, PEGS were produced using a ballpoint pen and a robotic cutter
plotter, although the devices can be produced using existing high-volume
printing methods such as screen printing, inkjet, and roll-to-roll
printing. PEGS are produced with environmentally friendly, nontoxic,
and biodegradable materials (cellulose paper can dissociate in soil)
and are suitable for incineration.

However, the PEGS technology
has the following four disadvantages:(i) PEGS are highly sensitive to RH; this
can be overcome by using PEGS in applications where the RH remains
constant (e.g., food packaging) or by monitoring RH with additional
(dedicated) sensors to account for any fluctuations in RH.

(ii) PEGS have low-specificity
(i.e.,
cross-sensitive to a range of gases). Even though this was not an
issue for the experiments involving food monitoring, it may be for
applications requiring the detection of a specific gas. For these
cases, PEGS can be modified with various chemical additives to tune
sensitivity to the target gas through liquid-phase chemical reactions.40,41 The sensors modified can be operated as a sensor array, the response
of which can be fed into a mathematical model to estimate the type
and concentration of a gaseous analyte.

(iii) PEGS require moisture for operation;
therefore, PEGS may not function with sufficiently high performance
in environments with low RH (<20%) in its current form.

(iv) PEGS are not suitable
for high-temperature
applications, since they are constructed using organic materials.



We demonstrated the use of PEGS in monitoring
gases in the headspace
of packaged food items, namely, fillets of cod and chicken breast.
We confirmed a clear correlation between the response of PEGS and
microbial counts measured through microbiological cultures. Hence,
PEGS are suitable for use as an indicator of change of freshness,
because of microbial contamination in packaged meat. Comparison with
the state-of-the-art micromachined metal oxide gas sensor-based electronic
nose (see section SI–P3 and Figure S7 in the SI) further revealed that the PEGS technology offers levels
of performance that can exceed existing, much more sophisticated,
sensing technologies. Although we did not study in detail in this
work, PEGS can sense the presence of vapors of water-miscible organic
solvents such as acetone, which will be the topic of a future study
(Figure S8 in the SI).

PEGS technology
can be integrated into NFC tags to produce on/off-type
wirelessly powered sensors that can also be interrogated wirelessly
with a smartphone. In the future, this can be extended to produce
quantitative sensors (instead of just on/off) that can be probed and
powered wirelessly using next-generation disposable integrated circuits
for NFC, containing elements with more mixed-signal functions. Although,
in this work, we have primarily explored the use of PEGS in food packaging,
its use is most certainly not limited to this application. PEGS can
find uses in the chemical industry (where hazardous gases need to
be monitored), medical analysis, farming, and environmental monitoring.42

Experimental Section
Sensor
Fabrication
For the fabrication of the paper
sensors, we mixed conductive carbon ink (No. C2130925D1, GWENT Group)
in a ratio of 55/45 wt % with a diluent (No. S60118D3, GWENT
Group). To fabricate the electrodes, we used a cutter plotter (GRAPHTEC,
Model CE6000-40) and a ballpoint pen (Sakura Gelly Roll METALLIC)
which we cleaned with acetone and manually filled with the mixture
of carbon ink. The electrodes were printed on chromatography paper
(WhatmanTM, grade 1 chromatography paper, 20 cm × 20 cm, 0.18
mm thickness) and dried at 60 °C for 30 min. We printed three
fingers on each electrode with 1 mm spacing between each finger of
the electrodes for the characterization experiments and 2 mm spacing
for the food trials (see Figure S9 in the
SI).

Sensor Characterization Setup
The homemade characterization
setup consisted of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) chamber that measured
120 mm × 60 mm × 40 mm (= 288 cm3). It had one
inlet (6 mm diameter), which divided into three supply lines using
a cross connector. A cotton pad supported mixing of the gases inside
the cross connector. The gas supply was controlled by mass flow controllers
(MFCs, type GM50A from MKS); two MFCs controlled the level of RH in
the chamber using a humidified and dry stream of pure nitrogen and
the third MFC provided the test gas (usually premixed to some ratio
in nitrogen by the supplier). The nitrogen flow was humidified by
bubbling through deionized water (Figure S10 in the SI). We purchased all gases from BOC with a C-level certificate
(±) of analysis of 5%.

Monitoring Food Spoilage
A single
experiment consisted
of three plastic food containers (180 mL each), two with a sample
of food (20–40 g of either chicken breast or cod fish) and
one with a few milliliters of water to create 100% RH as control.
Each container had two PEGS and one humidity sensor (Model HIH-5030)
inside. We added 20 μL of deionized water to each paper sensor
before the experiment. This allowed the sensor to reach equilibrium
with the high humidity atmosphere inside the containers faster (usually
within 4–6 h). We evaluated experimentally that with the addition
of 20 μL of water, the water content of the sensors was close
to the equilibrium water content at 100% RH. If this step was skipped,
it took up to 15 h for the paper to reach equilibrium. During this
time, information concerning spoilage gases could not be collected.

Electrical Measurements
We applied a sinusoidal voltage
signal with an amplitude of 0.1–10 V to the sensor and used
a transimpedance amplifier with gain resistors of 20 kΩ to 120
MΩ to amplify and read the output signal (current). We measured
the amplitude of this signal, which corresponded to the magnitude
|Z| of the impedance of the sensor. For the characterization
of the sensors, we took a measurement every second, together with
a measurement of humidity (from a commercial sensor, Model HIH-5030)
inside the chamber. In the food spoilage experiments, a recording
was made every minute.

Microbial Cultures
We prepared a
sterilized brain heart
infusion agar (BHIA) and added 20 mL of the mixture to 27 Petri dishes
to create a growth medium. Every 24 h, we blended a solid food sample
(cod/chicken 5 g) in a stomacher tool with physiological water in
a ratio of 1/10. The resulting liquid was further diluted with physiological
water to obtain three dilutions between 10–2 and
10–5. For each dilution, we added 100 μL of
the sample to the Petri dishes containing the growth medium and incubated
at a constant temperature of 37 °C. After 24 h, we used an image
processing software (ImageJ) to count the colonies on each Petri dish
to estimate the level of microbial contamination.
