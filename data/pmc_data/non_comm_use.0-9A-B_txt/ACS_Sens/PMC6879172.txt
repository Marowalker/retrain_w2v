Exhaled breath contains a large amount
of biochemical and physiological
information concerning one’s health and provides an alternative
route to noninvasive medical diagnosis of diseases. In the case of
lung diseases, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an
important biomarker associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and lung cancer and can be detected in exhaled breath. The
current method of breath analysis involves condensation of exhaled
breath, is not continuous or real time, and requires two separate
and bulky devices, complicating the periodic or long-term monitoring
of a patient. We report the first disposable paper-based electrochemical
wearable sensor that can monitor exhaled H2O2 in artificial breath calibration-free and continuously, in real
time, and can be integrated into a commercial respiratory mask for
on-site testing of exhaled breath. To improve precision for sensing
H2O2, we perform differential electrochemical
measurement by amperometry in which screen-printed Prussian Blue-mediated
and nonmediated carbon electrodes are used for differential analysis.
We were able to measure H2O2 in simulated breath
in a concentration-dependent manner in real time, confirming its functionality.
This proposed system is versatile, and by modifying the chemistry
of the sensing electrodes, our method of differential sensing can
be extended to continuous monitoring of other analytes in exhaled
breath.

==== Body
The global
air pollution has
been rising at an alarming rate due to the advancing industrialization
and dependency on motorized vehicles. This leads increasingly to severe
health problems.1 For example, disorders
concerning lung and airways, such as asthma, lung cancer, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, are on the rise according to the World
Health Organization.2 In total, 3.9 million
deaths each year worldwide are caused by respiratory diseases.3,4 A large proportion of respiratory diseases are chronic and require
frequent check-ups to monitor their progression. Inflammatory cells,
such as macrophages and neutrophils, produce H2O2 in a reaction to respiratory diseases.5,6 Detection of
H2O2 in exhaled breath as a biomarker of respiratory
illnesses may provide a noninvasive route to detect these diseases
quickly, noninvasively, and inexpensively. Unfortunately, H2O2 is difficult to measure in exhaled breath since it
is easily oxidized in air and is not stable with increasing pH in
aqueous solutions, including exhaled breath condensate (EBC) with
a pH between 7.8 and 8.1.7−9

For analysis of exhaled
breath, EBC is first collected and then
measured in centralized laboratories.10,11 The sample
collection is done by cooling the exhaled breath of a patient and
breathing into a special device that consists of a mouthpiece and
a cooled tube. The EBC is analyzed where the H2O2 concentration is determined using electrochemical (amperometric)
and optical (fluorometric, colorimetric, chemiluminescence, and fluorescence)
methods of detection.6,12 Devices for the EBC collection
and analysis are already commercially available (ECoScreen and ECoCheck
by FILT, Germany); however, due to their size and cost, they are not
suitable for an on-site or wearable continuous monitoring. Furthermore,
the current approaches for analyzing EBC are susceptible to errors
since the sample collected is influenced by the duration of storage,
temperature, amount of saliva, changing flow, and volume of exhaled
air.13

Wearable sensors may provide
a viable alternative to monitor constituents
of exhaled breath, without reliance on EBC, for accelerated and inexpensive
diagnosis of respiratory diseases. Wearable devices already exist
in various forms including smart watches, fitness bracelets, and digital
glasses.14−18 The concept of wearable sensors has already been accepted by the
general public and their adoption has increased dramatically over
the past few years.14 For biochemical analysis,
however, the reusability of a medical device is often out of the question;
therefore, a wearable sensor for monitoring exhaled breath must be
low-cost and disposable. For biochemical analysis, paper as a substrate
offers many advantages: it (i) is easy-to-handle, (ii) is permeable
for gases, (iii) is capable of absorbing fluids and allowing their
passive transport, (iv) can be folded, (v) has a good compatibility
with chemicals and biomolecules, (vi) is cost-effective, (vii) is
hygroscopic, and (viii) is disposable.19−21 Furthermore, the cellulose
fibers can easily be functionalized to modify paper’s permeability,
hydrophilicity, or reactivity, by patterning with waxes, inks, or
polymers through thermal curing.22

A notable example for paper-based wearable devices is the electrical
respiration sensor introduced by Güder and colleagues.23 In this approach, the respiratory activity (such
as breathing rate, relative volume, etc.) of a person can be observed
using a wearable mask with an integrated paper-based sensing device.
This sensor comprises two printed carbon electrodes on an ordinary
cellulose paper. The detecting principle is electrical and based on
the change in moisture in the paper. This again results in a detectable
change of the obtained signal between the carbon electrodes while
breathing. The cellulose paper is able to absorb up to 10% of its
own weight in water from humidity in air. This device can be used
without calibration since only the changes between inhaled and exhaled
air are measured. It is suitable for on-site monitoring as it is simple
to use via a mobile app and does not require any additional equipment.
This device, however, is limited to the determination of the physical
quantities related to breathing and cannot provide any biochemical
information that may be extracted from exhaled breath.

Prussian
Blue (PB) is known to be one of the most efficient electrocatalysts
for the detection of H2O2, which is taken advantage
of especially in the field of bio- and immunosensors.24−26 Here, oxidoreductase systems, most commonly glucose oxidase, alkaline
phosphatase, and horseradish peroxidase, are employed either for the
highly specific detection of an analyte or for the labeling of a bioassay.
The reaction product in all of these cases is H2O2, which can be electrochemically detected with high sensitivity using
PB-modified electrodes.27 Screen-printed
carbon electrodes are well suited for depositing PB and transduction
of the catalytic redox currents taking place on PB.12,28 Another advantage is that the potential for this reductive H2O2 detection lies at around 0.0 V versus Ag/AgCl
(0.1 M KCl), which is low enough to avoid the oxidation of possible
interfering substances.27 On the other
hand, oxygen is not reduced yet at a considerable rate at this potential,
which is an important prerequisite for the measurement of biological
samples.

As mentioned, the interfering substances is an important
issue
for the monitoring of exhaled breath. Besides the main gaseous constituents
(N2, O2, CO2, and H2O),
a vast number of more or less complex compounds can be found in breath.
Many of them are transferred from blood, although normally in a 100-
to 1000-fold lower concentration, usually in the ppt to ppm range.
These are mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including acetone,
isoprene, toluol, and limonene.29 However,
even nonvolatile molecules, such as glucose and peptides, are present
in exhaled breath.30 Furthermore, low-molecular-weight
compounds such as ammonia, thiols, and carbon monoxide are found.
However, none of these compounds can easily be reduced electrochemically.
Only nitric oxide (NO), being a biomarker for inflammatory diseases
as well, might be a potential interfering substance for H2O2 sensing. Yet, concentrations of NO in exhaled breath
lie in the range of <20 ppb for healthy persons and its half-life
is just a few seconds.31

This article
reports a low-cost, lightweight, and “calibration-free”
approach for the continuous, real-time, and on-site surveillance of
the concentration of H2O2 in simulated exhaled
breath. The wearable system developed employs an easy-to-fabricate
paper-based electrochemical sensor comprising a differential electrode
design with a PB-mediated carbon electrode for H2O2 detection and carbon blank electrode for subtracting the
background signals. A silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference and
a carbon counter electrode are used to complete the electrolytic cell.
The signal detection is achieved as H2O2 oxidizes
the PB, contained in the sensing electrode, which is subsequently
reduced at the electrode and results in a detectable cathodic current
signal. This decrease in the amperometric signal increases with increasing
H2O2 concentration. Thanks to its differential
design and the use of PB-mediated electrodes (highly selective for
H2O2), any unspecific redox reaction can be
canceled out. For compatibility with a standardized respiratory mask,
the developed paper-based H2O2 sensor is integrated
into the housing of a commercially available airway filter mainly
used in anesthetic applications.

Results and Discussion
The fabrication procedure for the paper sensors is illustrated
schematically in Figure 1A. First, wax patterns are printed on the chromatography paper (grade
1 CHR, 200 × 200 mm2, Whatman, U.K.) using a commercially
available wax printer (ColorQube 8580, Xerox corporation, USA) and
baked for 10 min at 120 °C in a conventional oven. When heated,
the layer of wax printed on the surface of paper wicks through the
bulk of the substrate and forms a hydrophobic barrier, defining the
electrolytic cell. The wax barrier plays two important roles: (i)
It prevents wicking of any droplets of water condensed during exhalation
to the contact pads during operation. (ii) The wax pattern contains
a solution of electrolyte before the water is evaporated from the
substrate to form a solid electrolyte. Next, the reference electrode
(RE) and conducting tracks are screen-printed with Ag/AgCl paste (C2040308P2,
Gwent Group, U.K.) and baked for 10 min at 80 °C. Finally, the
carbon counter (CE), blank, and PB-mediated sensing electrodes are
screen-printed using the nonmediated and mediated carbon pastes (C2030519P4
and C2070424P2, Gwent Group, U.K.) and baked for 15 min at 80 °C.

SolidWorks model of a filter extension for respiratory mask, including
the paper-based hydrogen peroxide sensor, and (D) image of respiratory
mask with the commercial filter extension with customized sidewalls,
containing the sensor chip.

We place the paper-based sensor chip inside a wearable respiratory
mask, such that the patient is breathing directly onto the sensor.
For integration into the ventilation mask, the paper chip is glued
between two PMMA sheets with an opening for the electrodes, as depicted
in Figure 1B. With
this, the sensor is mechanically stabilized and, at the same time,
the conducting tracks are isolated from potential shorts due to water
droplets originating from exhaled breath. Furthermore, we modify the
housing of a commercial filter (Figure 1C) by replacing the sidewalls with custom-made 3D printed
parts to mount the paper-based sensor into the housing, which allows
us to place it directly in the respiratory flow. With this approach,
moisture from the breath is captured by the paper sensor to wet the
electrodes, forming a liquid electrolytic cell, which is crucial for
the operability of the sensor. The entire system is illustrated in Figure 1D.

Because
paper itself is not ionically conductive, a droplet of
electrolyte is placed on the paper and dried, before measuring analytes
from exhaled breath. For the first measurements, 0.1 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) is used as the electrolyte, but during the measurement,
the sensor dried quickly; thus, it is not possible to maintain constant
conditions. To solve this problem, several electrolytes and humectants
are tested (see Figure S9). We have captured
cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in dry (after 1 day) and wet (DI water
added) conditions and finally with a droplet of 160 μM H2O2. Most of the compounds tested either could not
keep the paper wet or inhibited the detection of H2O2. Since 1 M potassium chloride (KCl) provides better characteristics
for the CVs and better sensitivity for H2O2 in
amperometric measurements than all other examined compounds, it is
chosen as the electrolyte for further experiments.

For the calibration
of the paper-based H2O2 sensor, the current
behavior over time is recorded for different
hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Amperometry at a constant potential
of 0.0 V versus Ag/AgCl (a screen-printed RE electrode) is carried
out using different paper chips (n = 7). The frontside
of the electrodes is isolated using an adhesive tape, as the paper-based
sensors are positioned in the respiratory mask with the backside facing
the user; hence, the frontside of the electrode structures has no
direct contact with the exhaled breath. First, a droplet of 1 M KCl
solution is placed on the electrolytic cell of the paper chip, and
then, measurements with increasing the H2O2 concentration
are performed. The obtained calibration curve is shown in Figure 2A. Here, a linear
measurement range between 5 and 320 μM hydrogen peroxide is
achieved with a sensitivity of 0.19 nA μM–1 mm–2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Besides,
the current values at a given H2O2 concentration,
obtained from seven different sensors, prove a very small deviation.
This means that a single prior calibration of the final sensor design
delivers reliable absolute values and the H2O2 measurement in simulated breath can be performed calibration-free
(without any calibration).

5–320
μM H2O2 in 1 M KCl solution. Herein, the
frontside of the chip was insulated with an adhesive tape since the
sensor is placed into the filter with the backside toward the patient,
and thus, the frontside of the electrodes has no direct contact with
the exhaled breath. Error bars represent ±standard deviation
(SD) of n = 7 replicates. (B) Scheme of measurement

humidifier, a H2O2 evaporator, and a filter
housing with an integrated H2O2 sensor. (C)
Cyclic voltammograms of a dry chip with a PB-coated working electrode,
pretreated with 1 M KCl, in vapor after 9 (gray), 24 (red), 70 (blue),
185 (green), 195 (orange), and 198 (black, dashed) breaths at a scan
rate of 100 mV s–1.

To mimic the human respiration, it is necessary to create a periodic
air flow, generating a warm and humid gas flow using a lung simulator,
as the human exhaled breath contains ∼100% RH at a temperature
of around 34 °C. Using a customized LabVIEW software (National
Instruments, USA), the lung simulator pumps a desired volume of air
with a predefined frequency. The RH and temperature are adjusted using
a commercially available humidifier (HumiCare 200, Gründler
Medical, Germany) that contains heated tubing. To introduce different
concentrations of H2O2 an evaporator with a
heating element is placed in between the lung simulator and the paper
sensor. A scheme of this setup is illustrated in Figure 2B, and a video describing the
entire measurement setup can be found in the Supporting Information.

Since the moisture content of the paper
is varying with the changing
RH during inhalation and exhalation, to study the effect of RH on
the redox characteristics of the PB-mediated carbon electrode, we
performed CV measurements using a dry chip, pretreated with 1 M KCl,
in H2O2-free simulated breath. In all experiments
(except the tests of respiration frequency and volume), the lung simulator
is set to generate a tidal volume of 500 mL and a frequency of 15
breaths per minute, which are realistic values for a healthy adult.
As it can be observed in Figure 2C, the initially dry sensor can be wetted only by the
respiratory stream itself, assuring a high and more reliable electrochemical
signal. After 195 breaths (13 min), the measured current signals do
not alter anymore and exhibit a typical PB–CV of a wet sensor
in 1 M KCl.

In Figure 3A, the
current signal of an amperometric measurement at different respiration
frequencies is illustrated. It is noticeable that slower breathing
results in a lower frequency of the signal measured and vice versa,
while no significant signal change is observed by a volume change
(see Figure 3B). During
one breathing period, the water content in the paper changes periodically,
as the air stream is drier during inhalation and reaches a RH of ∼100%
during exhaling. Accordingly, the ionic conductivity of the paper
fibers changes.21,23 Even though variations in conductivity
are less important in an amperometric setup, the signal might decrease
if the paper becomes too dry (see Figure 2C). However, as the blank electrodes without
PB show a similar response, we conclude that the periodic variations
must be mostly attributed to capacitive currents due to the humidity
dependent changes of the dielectric properties of the paper.32 Probably, only fibers in direct contact with
the electrode surface contribute to this effect. Hence, this capacitive
part of the current is probably quite sensitive to the surface morphology
of every individual electrode and is expected to reach its maximum
at the reversal points of the respiratory movement.

and blank (red) electrodes of an amperometric
measurement at different respiration (A) frequencies and (B) volumes,
(C) current density of a calibration measurement with 5–320
μM H2O2 in vapor, and (D) calibration
curve of the aqueous and vaporous hydrogen peroxide in artificial
breath. Error bars represent ±SD of n = 3 replicates.

To obtain a calibration curve for hydrogen peroxide
in the vapor
of the artificial breath, H2O2 solutions of
different concentrations are evaporated and the current signal over
time is recorded continuously. A typical measurement is shown in Figure 3C. As soon as a steady-state
current is reached, the next higher concentration is added, as indicated
with the arrows labeled with the corresponding concentration. In our
measurement setup, there is an additional delay resulting from the
time the analyte needs to be transported toward the sensor surface
after the injection of the sample. Therefore, it is not possible to
extract the real response time from this data. Nevertheless, the response
time to obtain a steady-state current depends on the peroxide concentration
in the vapor. The reason for this behavior is probably due to the
time it takes for the concentration of H2O2 in
vapor to equilibrate with its dissolved form in water (i.e., dissolved
in the moisture within paper). At higher H2O2 concentrations in the vapor, the gradient between vapor and “paper
electrolyte” is higher, and thus, a steeper current increase
as well as a higher limiting current is expected, which is almost
in line with our observations.

The behavior of the blank (background)
electrode can be also observed
in Figure 3A–C.
The measured blank signals do not settle at the same baseline currents
as the sensing electrode. However, these different baseline currents
can be aligned for the evaluation by setting an offset value (see Figure S11).

For the construction of the
calibration curve, the current densities
of the blank curve are first subtracted from those of the sensor electrode.
After averaging and baseline subtraction, a measurement value is taken
for each hydrogen peroxide concentration at a point on the timeline
shortly before the next higher concentration is injected. The baseline
value of the sensor is taken right before addition of the first hydrogen
peroxide concentration of 40 μM. The mean values for the calibration
curve presented in Figure 3D are obtained from three independent measurements.

From these results, it can be concluded that H2O2 concentrations in the range between 40 and 320 μM give
rise to a response with a sensitivity of 0.02 nA μM–1 mm–2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99. It
is crucial to note, however, that the resulting current signals for
the respective H2O2 concentrations are significantly
lower than those of the former calibration in aqueous solutions (Figure 2A). This may be due
to the heating of the H2O2 in the evaporator
and the poor stability of H2O2 in DI water (see Figure S10). By correlating the obtained current
densities with those of the previous calibration in solution, the
real H2O2 concentrations in the vapor of the
artificial breath can be estimated to lie between 5 and 40 μM.
This means that, after evaporation, the H2O2 concentration may be decreasing to approximately 1/8 of its original
value while the same sensitivity as in solution is maintained, i.e.,
0.19 nA μM–1 mm–2 (Figures 3D and S12). The humid air from the humidifier also
dilutes the analyte, yielding a smaller concentration. Nevertheless,
after accounting for all of these factors, a reliable quantification
of different hydrogen peroxide concentrations in vapor is achieved
and the proof-of-concept of the claimed approach for on-site H2O2 analysis in simulated exhaled breath is successfully
demonstrated for the first time.

In summary, this work describes
a differential electrochemical
method using low-cost and lightweight porous materials (in our case
cellulose paper) for on-site monitoring of hydrogen peroxide in exhaled
breath. For compatibility with standardized ventilation masks, the
sensor developed is integrated into the housing of a commercially
available airway filter for anesthetic applications. Under realistic
conditions by simulating human respiration with authentic lung volume
and respiration rate, the proof-of-principle of the hydrogen peroxide
measurements in artificial exhaled breath is successfully shown for
the first time. The high reliability and reproducibility of our sensing
approach allow us to measure calibration-free, i.e., it is unnecessary
to perform a calibration before or after each measurement. With further
modifications and improvements, this sensor model can be employed
in a large variety of applications, including clinical or wearable
monitoring of exhaled breath.

Our method has the following five
advantages: (i) because of differential
measurements, the influence of various interfering substances and/or
environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) is eliminated;
hence, the system always produces reliable results. (ii) By changing,
modifying, and/or coating the material of the sensing electrode (for
instance, with metals, metal oxides, semiconducting micro- and nanoparticles,
enzymes, selective membranes, or conducting polymers), the sensor
model presented can be extended for the analysis of other compounds
of exhaled breath. (iii) A flexible and hygroscopic porous support,
like paper, acts as a “solid electrolyte”, eliminating
the need for additional membranes (containing the electrolyte) and
at the same time as a substrate for the electrodes. (iv) Flexible
and porous substrates can be shaped and patterned in a way that the
sensing surface as well as the collection volume can be considerably
increased. (v) The orientation and porosity of the sensing surface
can be tuned to minimize breathing resistance and to improve signal
quality.

The system proposed has the following disadvantages:
(i) the sensor’s
sensitivity achieved with the commercially available PB-mediated carbon
paste does not allow us to measure within the clinically relevant
concentration range of H2O2 in exhaled breath
(0.1–1.5 μM in the case of EBC6) and (ii) the electrolyte employed (1 M potassium chloride) gets
dried quickly under ambient conditions and thus the paper chip needs
some running time (less than 15 min) to be moistened after its exposure
to the respiration. Furthermore, as the humidity in paper changes
while inhaling and exhaling, the conductivity and ion concentration
of the “solid paper electrolyte” and thus the measured
signals vary periodically.

These, however, can be overcome by
a few improvements: (i) the
search for the optimum humectant as a possible electrolyte should
be continued since it would facilitate the handling and signal processing,
if the sensor stayed wet and does not adsorb any humidity from the
breath. (ii) PB-mediated carbon paste with different PB contents and
modification procedures must be tested to further increase the H2O2 sensitivity. Alternatively, hydrophilic metal
electrodes (especially Pt), realized by metallization of fabrics,
can be examined for their applicability.33 Besides, the implemented system should be extended with a compact
and low-power wearable signal readout unit along with a smartphone
app to enable on-site monitoring. Overcoming these issues, mainly
with their sensitivity and humectants, electrochemical wearable sensors
using porous materials (such as paper) would pave the way for calibration-free,
continuous monitoring of exhaled breath.
