Adenosine 5-triphosphate
(ATP) is the main free energy carrier
in metabolism. In budding yeast, shifts to glucose-rich conditions
cause dynamic changes in ATP levels, but it is unclear how heterogeneous
these dynamics are at a single-cell level. Furthermore, pH also changes
and affects readout of fluorescence-based biosensors for single-cell
measurements. To measure ATP changes reliably in single yeast cells,
we developed yAT1.03, an adapted version of the AT1.03 ATP biosensor,
that is pH-insensitive. We show that pregrowth conditions largely
affect ATP dynamics during transitions. Moreover, single-cell analyses
showed a large variety in ATP responses, which implies large differences
of glycolytic startup between individual cells. We found three clusters
of dynamic responses, and we show that a small subpopulation of wild-type
cells reached an imbalanced state during glycolytic startup, characterized
by low ATP levels. These results confirm the need for new tools to
study dynamic responses of individual cells in dynamic environments.

==== Body
Adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP)
is one of the key players in cellular metabolism as it is the major
Gibbs energy-carrier for most if not all species.1,2 ATP
is produced either by proton-gradient driven ATPases or by substrate-level
phosphorylation. The latter occurs in glycolysis, the central metabolic
pathway in many organisms, including human. A key question is how
pathway flux is regulated under dynamic conditions, which not only
happens in nature and biotechnical processes,3−6 but also in humans.7−9 Given the task of
glycolysis to produce ATP, it is not a surprise that the glycolytic
flux is (also) regulated by ATP itself.10,11

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (or budding
yeast) has been the focus of many studies of glycolysis; when it encounters
an environmental change to glucose-rich conditions, glycolysis rapidly
becomes active.12−14 For glycolysis to run, an initial investment of two
ATPs in the upper part (the conversion from glucose to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate)
is needed, which is succeeded by a return of four ATPs in the lower
part (the conversion from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to pyruvate,
in twofold, Figure 1). When glucose is added, the initial and rapid use of ATP thus creates
an (temporarily) imbalance between the two parts of glycolysis, resulting
in a transient decrease of ATP levels.14−16 The initial difference
in flux between the two parts of glycolysis can recover, resulting
in a balanced state. However, the upper glycolysis flux can also continue
to exceed the lower glycolysis flux, resulting in an imbalanced state.16−18

Figure 1 Schematic
overview of glycolysis. Startup of glycolysis requires
an investment of two ATP molecules in the upper part of glycolysis.
Lower part of glycolysis yields four ATP afterward.

These studies therefore suggested that startup of glycolysis
can
be highly variable, with a small fraction of cells dynamically ending
up in an imbalanced metabolic state.17 This
can be important for industrial processes in which metabolic subpopulations
can affect industrial efficiency.3−6 Such variability could also have implications
for therapeutic efficiencies in human diseases.19−22 These conclusions, however, were
based on computational modeling and indirect evidence; in particular,
pH was used as an indirect readout of metabolism not ATP itself. There
is a need, therefore, to directly monitor ATP dynamics at the single
cell level and establish a low ATP, imbalanced state. However, continuous
measurements of ATP, and hence glycolytic startup dynamics have not
been studied at a single-cell level.

In recent years, several
fluorescence-based biosensors for in vivo
monitoring of ATP in single cells have been developed, including the
AT1.03 and the QUEEN sensor.23,24 However, these sensors
use fluorescent proteins (FPs) that are pH-sensitive in the physiological
range, where the intracellular pH of budding yeast operates.17,25−29 In fact, the pH transiently drops exactly during glycolytic startup.17,30 Moreover, the metabolic imbalanced state leads to an inability to
maintain pH homeostasis, resulting in a significant drop in intracellular
pH, making the sensors unsuitable to study ATP dynamics during glycolytic
startup. Therefore, we adapted the AT1.03 sensor to become less pH-sensitive.
This modified sensor, denoted yAT1.03, is pH-robust and can be used
to reliably detect single-cell ATP dynamics.

Materials
and Methods
yAT1.03 Construction
The ATP sensor AT1.03 and its
inactive variant AT1.03R122KR126K in the yeast expression
vector pDRF1-GW were a gift from Wolf Frommer (Addgene plasmids #28003
and #28005, respectively). First, an EcoRI restriction site was removed
by performing a PCR on AT1.03 and AT1.03R122KR126K pDRF-GW
using KOD polymerase (Merck-Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts,
USA) with the forward primer 5′-ATACTAGTGCTAGCTCTAGACTCGAGTATGGTGAG-3′
and reverse primer 5′-ATAGCGGCCGCTGATCAGCGGTTTAAACTTAAGC-3′.
Next, the product and pDRF1-GW were digested using SpeI and NotI (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA), and the PCR product
was ligated into pDRF1-GW using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). Next,
a PCR was performed on tdTomato pDRF1-GW using FW primer 5′-ATGAATTCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′
and RV primer 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-3′.
The PCR product and the new AT1.03 and AT1.03R122KR126K in pDRF1-GW were digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and NotI.
Afterward, the PCR product was ligated into AT1.03 and AT1.03R122KR126K in pDRF1-GW using T4 ligase, which replaced cp173-mVenus
with tdTomato. Next, a PCR using KOD polymerase was performed on ymTq2
pDRF1-GW with FW primer 5′-CTGCTAGCACTAGTAAGCTTTTAA-3′
and RV primer 5′-ATATCGATAGCAGCAGTAACGAATTCC-3′, which
produced ymTq2 with the last 11 amino acids removed (ymTq2Δ11).
The PCR product and AT1.03 and AT1.03R122KR126K in pDRF1-GW
were digested with NheI and ClaI (New England Biolabs). Next, the
PCR product was ligated into AT1.03 and AT1.03R122KR126K in pDRF1-GW using T4 ligase, which produced AT1.03ymTq2Δ11-tdTomato and AT1.03R122KR126K-ymTq2Δ11-tdTomato, named yAT1.03 and yAT1.03R122KR126K.

Yeast Transformation
The yeast strain W303-1A (MATa,
leu2-3/112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11/15, ade2-1, can1-100) was transformed
as described by Gietz and Schiestl.31

ConA Solution
Concanavalin A was prepared, as described
by Hansen et al., 2015.32 Briefly, 5 mg
of concanavalin A (type IV, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 5 mL of
phosphate-buffered saline at pH 6.5, 40 mL of H2O, 2.5
mL of 1 M MnCl2, and 2.5 mL of 1 M CaCl2. This
solution was aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C.

In Vitro Characterization
W303-1A WT cells expressing
yAT1.03 pDRF-GW and the empty pDRF1-GW vector were grown overnight
at 200 rpm and 30 °C in 1× yeast nitrogen base without amino
acids (YNB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), containing 100 
mM glucose (Boom BV, Meppel, Netherlands), 20 mg/L adenine hemisulfate
(Sigma-Aldrich), 20  mg/L l-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich),
20  mg/L l-histidine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 60 
mg/L l-leucine (SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).
Next, cells were diluted in 50 mL of medium and grown to an OD600 of approximately 3. Cells were kept on ice and washed twice
with 20 mL of 0.01 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer at pH 7 containing 0.75 g/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Next, cells were
resuspended in 2 mL of 0.01 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer containing 0.75 g/L EDTA and washed twice
in 1 mL of ice-cold 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer at pH 7.4 containing 0.4 g/L MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were transferred to screw cap tubes containing
0.75 g of glass beads (425–600 μm) and lysed using a
FastPrep-24 5G (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) with 8 bursts
of 6 m/s and 10 s. Last, the lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at
21,000g, and the cell-free extracts were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen.

Per sample, 5 wells of a black 96-well microtiter
plate (Greiner Bio-One) were filled with 4 μL of cell-free extract
(10× diluted in distilled water) and 36 μL of 10 mM HEPES–KOH
buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) at various pHs. Fluorescence spectra were recorded
after subsequent additions of ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) using a CLARIOstar
plate reader (BMG labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Spectra were obtained
using 430/20 nm excitation and 460–660 nm emission (10 nm bandwidth).
Fluorescence spectra were corrected for background fluorescence (by
correcting for fluorescence of cell-free extract of cells expressing
the empty pDRF1-GW plasmid), and Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET) ratios were calculated by dividing acceptor over donor fluorescence.
Changes of ATP levels in the cell-free extracts were measured by measuring
the FRET levels in time at either 0.3 or 1.1 mM ATP. The dose–response
curve was fitted to eq 1,23 with FRETmax and FRETmin denoting the maximal and minimal FRET values obtained,
respectively, ATP the ATP concentration (mM), kd the dissociation constant (mM), and n the
Hill coefficient (n). 1  

Microscopy
Cells expressing yAT1.03
or yAT1.03R122KR126K were grown overnight at 200 rpm and
30 °C in
1× YNB medium, containing 20 mg/L adenine hemisulfate, 20 mg/L l-tryptophan, 20 mg/L l-histidine, 60 mg/L l-leucine, and either 1% ethanol (v/v, VWR International, Radnor,
PA, United States of America), 100 mM fructose (Sigma-Aldrich),
or 111 mM galactose (Sigma-Aldrich). Next, cells were diluted in the
same medium and grown overnight to a maximum OD600 of 1.5
(midlog). Afterward, the cells were transferred to a six-well plate
containing ConA-coated coverslips. Coverslips with the attached cells
were put in an Attofluor cell chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), and 1 mL of fresh medium was added. Next, the coverslips
were imaged using a Nikon Ti-eclipse widefield fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Minato, Tokio, Japan) at 30 °C equipped with a TuCam
system (Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland) containing 2 Andor Zyla
5.5 sCMOS Cameras (Andor) and a SOLA 6-LCR-SB power source (Lumencor,
Beaverton, OR, USA). FRET was recorded using a 438/24 nm excitation
filter, a 483/32 nm donor emission filter, and a 593/40 nm acceptor
emission filter with a 552 nm long-pass (LP) dichroic filter (all
filters from Semrock, Lake Forest, IL, USA). For sensor expression
levels, tdTomato was measured using a 570/20 nm filter and a 593/40
nm filter with a 600 LP dichroic mirror. After recording the baseline,
111 μL of 1× YNB containing the necessary amino acids and
a 10× amount of the desired substrate was added. For the multiple
glucose pulses, subsequent additions of 20, 20, 40, and 80 μL
of 50 mM glucose at 3, 10, 17, and 24 min were added to the cell chamber.
At least two biological replicates were obtained for each experiment.
Cells were segmented by an in-house macro using FiJi (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA), and moving or dead cells were manually removed.

pH Sensitivity
of the FRET Pair In Vivo
W303-1A yeast
cells expressing the tdTomato-mTq2 were grown, as described for microscopy.
Cells were washed twice with sterile water and resuspended in a citrate
phosphate buffer [0.1 M citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 M-Na2HPO4 (Sigma-Aldrich)] with pH values from 3 to
8 and 2  mM of the ionophore 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP, Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were loaded on a glass slide. Next, cells were visualized and
FRET ratios were determined, as described for microscopy.

Growth Experiments
W303-1a cells expressing yAT1.03
and the empty pDRF1-GW vector or WT cells were grown to midlog, as
described for microscopy, with the medium containing 1% ethanol. Cells
were washed and resuspended to an OD600 of 1 with the same
medium without any carbon source. Next, 20 μL of cells was transferred
to a 48-well plate with each well containing 480 μL of fresh
medium with either 0.1% ethanol, 10 mM galactose, 10 mM fructose,
or 10 mM glucose. Afterward, cells were grown in a Clariostar plate
reader at 30 °C and 700 rpm orbital shaking. OD600 was measured every 5 min.

Data Analysis
R version 3.5.1 (R
Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to analyze and visualize the
obtained data. In brief, tdTomato fluorescence was corrected for mTq2
bleedtrough (0.12% of mTq2 fluorescence), and cells with a fluorescence
below 500 counts (arbitrary units) were deleted. FRET ratio normalization
was performed by dividing all FRET values by the mean FRET value of
the baseline (before perturbations). Maximal FRET decrease and increase
were determined with a sliding window of three frames. Clustering
was performed using the R code made available on Github by Joachim
Goedhart (https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart). Cluster amounts were determined by using the fviz_nbclust function
from the factoextra package.

Results
yAT1.03 Has
Improved pH Robustness
Experiments performed
with AT1.03 showed aberrant drifts in the FRET signal in unperturbed
cells using our setup (Figure S1). Furthermore,
the original paper that reported AT1.03 already showed the pH sensitivity
in the range of physiological pH of yeast.23 We hypothesized that the baseline drift and the pH sensitivity are
caused by the FPs because the donor mseCFP is poorly characterized
and mVenus is known to be pH-sensitive and not photostable.25 Based on this, we undertook improvement of AT1.03
by changing the FPs to ymTq2Δ11 (donor) and tdTomato (acceptor)
as a more reliable and pH-insensitive FRET pair (Botman et al., in
submission33). Replacements of mseCFP for
ymTq2Δ11 and cp173-mVenus for tdTomato resulted in yAT1.03.
In vitro characterization showed a huge improvement in pH sensitivity
compared to the original AT1.03 sensor.23 With the new FPs, FRET ratios, at a fixed ATP concentration (Figure S2), remained stable across the normal
physiological pH range (pH 6.25–7.25) of yeast (Figure 2C), indicating that the pH
sensitivity of the original AT1.03 sensor indeed arose from the FPs.
Because pH sensitivity can be different in vivo compared to in vitro,
we checked whether the new FRET pair was also pH-robust in vivo. The
new FRET pair showed to be robust to pH values from 8 to 5 in vivo
(Figure 2D). Also,
no intermolecular FRET was observed as expression levels of yAT1.03
did not affect FRET ratios (Figure 2E). The yAT1.03 sensor showed a kd of 3.2 mM for ATP, which is almost identical to the original
AT1.03. Last, expression of yAT1.03 in W303-1A had no effect on growth
(Figure S3), indicating that the sensor
can be used without adverse effects on yeast physiology.

yAT1.03 Measures ATP Reliably
In vitro characterization
of the sensor showed robust ATP responses of the sensor. To verify
that yAT1.03 visualizes ATP changes reliably in vivo as well, we performed
several control experiments (Figure 3). First, we tested whether the sensor showed a typical
transient change in ATP when cells experience a sudden glucose perturbation
(Figure 3A). As expected,
yAT1.03 FRET ratios transiently decreased, followed by a recovery,
while no response was observed when medium without glucose was pulsed.
The same glucose perturbation did not elicit a response in the nonresponsive
sensor yAT1.03R122KR126K. These results imply that the
sensor indeed measures ATP and no other effects.

Figure 3 In vivo experiments show
reliable yAT1.03 output. (A) W303-1A WT
cells expressing yAT1.03 or yAT1.03R122KR126K (depicted
above each graph) were grown on 1% EtOH. At t = 0
min, glucose or the same medium without glucose was added and the
FRET responses were measured. (B) W303-1A WT cells expressing yAT1.03
or yAT1.03R122KR126K were grown with 1% EtOH and incubated
in 10 mM glucose for at least 1 h. Afterward, cells were visualized
and 10 mM 2-DG was added at t = 0 min. (C) W303-1A
WT cells expressing yAT1.0 were grown with 1% EtOH or 100 mM glucose
as the substrate (depicted above each graph). Antimycin A or only
the solvent (mock) was added to the cells at t =
0 min. Lines show mean responses, normalized to the baseline, shaded
areas indicate SD, and color indicates either the sensor expressed
or the added solution. Percentages are v/v, abbreviations: EtOH, ethanol.

Next, we tested if an extreme
perturbation of metabolism affects yAT1.03 readouts (Figure 3B). Cells were incubated for
60–90 min in 10 mM glucose after which the glycolytic inhibitor
2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) was added to the cells. 2-DG is
transported and phosphorylated by ATP but not further metabolized
and thus acts as an ATP drain.34,35 FRET responses showed
a rapid decrease of FRET, which confirms that the sensor faithfully
reports depletion of the ATP pool caused by 2-DG. In contrast, the
nonresponsive sensor yAT1.03R122KR126K showed only a minor
response, indicating that the yAT1.03 sensor performs robustly in
response to extreme metabolic perturbations. This was also confirmed
by pulsing 5 mM of glucose to cells lacking tps1, which end up in
a severe metabolic imbalanced state, with reported low ATP levels
and growth arrest (Figure S4).17,36 Lastly, we tested whether we could distinguish that ATP is generated
by respirative or fermentative metabolism (Figure 3C). Cells were grown with either 1% ethanol
as the substrate (ATP generation entirely dependent on respiration)
or 100 mM glucose as the substrate (ATP generation largely through
fermentation). Subsequently, 50 μM of antimycin A was added
to block respiration through inhibition of the mitochondrial electron
transport chain complex III. As anticipated, addition of antimycin
A only depleted ATP levels, when cells were growing on ethanol as
a substrate. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that yAT1.03
can be used for robust measurements of ATP dynamics in vivo.

Pregrowth
Conditions Largely Determine ATP Responses during
Transitions
After establishing yAT1.03 as a robust ATP sensor,
we used it to characterize ATP dynamics in response to different carbon
source transitions. Cells were grown on various carbon sources and
transitioned to glucose (the preferred carbon source) or galactose
(Figure 4A). Cells
grown on fructose showed only a small transient ATP response when
challenged with 100 mM glucose, and no response with 20 mM glucose.
In contrast, glucose addition to galactose-grown cells induced the
biggest transient decrease of ATP with a mean decrease of 37% in FRET.
Lastly, glucose and galactose addition to ethanol-grown cells both
show a response, but the responses are qualitatively very different.
Glucose addition results in a transient FRET decrease of 24%. In contrast,
galactose addition lacked a transient ATP response but showed a steady
decrease to the same level compared to glucose, 10 min after addition.
Interestingly, both the decrease and recovery of ATP show a high degree
of variability between cells, indicating heterogeneity in the responses
of individual cells (Figure 4A,B).

with increasing amounts of glucose. Arrows indicate time points of

and grey lines show single-cell traces.

Finally, because we were able to conveniently measure ATP in time
in living cells, we looked at how ATP levels change in response to
multiple successive glucose additions (Figure 4D). The first addition of only 1 mM of glucose
to ethanol-growing cells induced a clear transient ATP decrease, but
subsequent additions showed only slight responses for most cells.
Still, we found heterogeneity again in the responses of individual
cells, as can be seen from single-cell traces in Figures 4 and S6.

ATP Dynamics during Glycolysis
Start-Up Are Heterogeneous between
Cells
Because the ATP responses showed high variability,
we looked in
more detail at single-cell responses during the ethanol to 20 mM glucose
transition (Figure 5). Visualization of the single-cell trajectories and their distributions
clearly showed large heterogeneity during the response (Figure 5A,B and Movie S1). We used a hierarchical clustering approach (using
Euclidean clustering) to see if dynamic traces can be grouped into
distinct response classes (Figure 5C). Next, we determined the optimal cluster amounts
(3) using the silhouette method (Figure S5). We identified three types of responses and determined various
characteristics for each, such as the absolute baseline FRET ratio
(the non-normalized FRET ratio before sugar addition), change in the
normalized FRET values at the end of the timecourse compared to the
baseline (ΔFRET), the maximal FRET decrease—(ATP depletion
rate) and the increase rate (ATP recovery rate), the minimum FRET
value (lowest amount of ATP obtained after the transition), and the
time to reach this minimum FRET value (Figure 5D). No difference in the non-normalized baseline
FRET values could be found between the clusters, indicating that the
starting ATP alone does not determine the ATP dynamics after a transition
to glucose. The first cluster contained approximately 61% of all responses
and showed a small transient decrease in ATP followed by rapid recovery
to preperturbation levels after approximately 8 min. The second cluster
contained 36% of the cells and showed a large transient decrease in
ATP, followed by fast, but not yet full, recovery after 12 min. A
third, smaller cluster contained 3% of all cells and was characterized
by rapid ATP depletion, similar to perturbations with either 2-DG
or antimycin A (Figure 2), with very slow recovery (or even absent for some cells in this
cluster). The absence of ATP recovery in some cells is indicative
of an imbalanced metabolic state that cells can get trapped in during
these transitions.17 Such heterogeneous
ATP responses were also found when cells were pulsed successively
with increasing amounts of glucose (Figure S6). Here, some cells only showed an ATP response after the first glucose
pulse and some cells show a response after each addition, while yet
others show no responses to any of the perturbations. In contrast
to dynamic conditions, steady-state ATP levels of glucose-grown cells
showed no clear subpopulations (Figure S8). In summary, we show that glycolytic start-up is highly heterogeneous,
ranging in the one extreme from cells that show small or no transient
changes in ATP to cells that end up in an imbalanced state with no
or little recovery of ATP after a glucose pulse (on short time-scale).

Discussion
Previous work showed that nutrient transitions can result in phenotypic
subpopulations and suggested that these subpopulations are a consequence
of nongenetic metabolic difference between individual cells.17 We therefore require tools to study metabolic
dynamics at the single-cell level. To gain insights into the dynamics
of ATP in single yeast cells, we adapted the AT1.03 sensor to make
it more suitable for readouts under dynamic conditions. Specifically,
metabolic dynamics in yeast are often characterized by pH changes,17,27 and the AT1.03 sensor is sensitive in the physiological pH-range
of S. cerevisiae.23 Also, ATP and pH homeostasis are intimately coupled, and
this presents an obvious challenge: simultaneous changes in ATP and
pH will significantly confound the sensor signal and its interpretation.
Furthermore, we found that the original sensor showed unpredictable
baseline drifts (Figure S1), which we believe
is caused by photochromicity; this is also affected by pH changes
because the mechanisms of photochromism involves (de)protonation of
the chromophore.37−39 Because photochromic behavior is difficult to be
prevented and it hampers characterization of pH effects, we could
not reliably characterize the pH sensitivity of the original AT1.03
sensor and compare it directly with yAT1.03. Our modified sensor shows
pH stability without photochromic behaviors, in the required physiological
range (pH 6.25–7.25) and has a kd of 3.2 mM, which is optimal, given intracellular ATP concentrations
in yeast between 1 and 4 mM.14−17,40−43 Our control experiments show that the sensor can be used to reliably
measure ATP levels, even for rather extreme metabolic perturbations.
First, treatment of fermenting cells with the glycolytic inhibitor
2-DG showed clear ATP drainage. Second, inhibition of the electron
transport chain only affects ATP levels in cells growing on ethanol
(respiring) and not on glucose (fermenting). In addition, behavior
of the nonresponsive yAT1.03R122KR126K demonstrated specificity
toward ATP.

We characterized ATP dynamics in response to various
sudden carbon
source transitions as a readout for glycolytic activation. We found
that ATP response depended significantly on the combination of pregrowth
conditions and pulsed carbon source. For example, galactose-grown
cells have a bigger ATP depletion compared to ethanol-grown cells,
indicating a large imbalance between ATP consumption and production
during start-up of glycolysis (Figure 3). This suggests that cells grown on galactose may
have a higher glucose-phosphorylation capacity in the upper part of
glycolysis compared to ethanol, which is in line with the fact that
galactose is a glycolytic substrate and ethanol is a gluconeogenetic
one. Indeed, previous reports state that galactose-grown cells have
a higher expression of the hexokinases and glucose transport capacity.15,44−46 In addition, we show that galactose addition to ethanol-grown
cells does not cause a rapid transient decrease in ATP but rather
a gradual reduction in ATP levels toward a new steady–steady
state. These differences indicate that galactose does not cause the
same transient imbalance in ATP consumption and production that glucose
does when cells are precultured on ethanol. Although the first step
in galactose metabolism also involves substrate phosphorylation, and
therefore ATP consumption, this activity will initially be low as
the galactose metabolizing Leloir pathway is only fully induced in
the presence of galactose. We also measured ATP dynamics in fructose-grown
cells subjected to sudden glucose additions. The small or absent response
to glucose indicates that glycolysis is hardly perturbed. This makes
sense, as based on growth rates, the glycolytic flux is similar for
these sugars (0.37 and 0.35 h–1 for glucose and
fructose, respectively, Figure S9). These
results combined indicate that the transient ATP decrease is caused
by an imbalance between upper (ATP consuming) and lower (ATP producing)
parts during the start-up of glycolysis. The timing at which cells
experience their minimal ATP levels (minutes of maximal dip) is independent
of the extent of ATP decrease (Figures 4A and S7). This suggests
that a larger initial ATP depletion is not caused by a longer duration
of the upper- and lower-glycolytic imbalance but by the magnitude
of the imbalance.

Last, we pulsed cells sequentially with increasing
amounts of glucose
(Figure 4C). Most cells
display a transient decrease of ATP only in response to the first
addition of 1 mM glucose. After that, the majority of the cells display
no (or diminished) ATP response to successive glucose additions. Ethanol-grown
cells express HXT6 and HXT7 with a Km around
1 mM.45 Apparently, the addition of extra
glucose to these cells does not cause a new imbalance between the
upper and lower glycolysis.

Our clustering analysis of the ethanol
to 20 mM glucose transition
(Figure 5) showed that
a small fraction of approximately 3% of cells showed this phenotype.
An earlier study showed that sudden transitions to glucose cause small
populations of cells to end up in a low pH state, a state inferred
to indicate an upper- and lower glycolytic imbalance.17 Our ATP measurements support this inference, showing that
indeed a small subpopulation of cells have trouble balancing ATP consumption
and production during glycolytic start-up. Previously, it was shown
that small variations in metabolic parameters, including enzyme expression
levels and metabolite concentrations, determine how a cell will respond
to sudden glucose addition. Our data suggest that differences in glycolytic
start-up dynamics cannot be explained solely by initial ATP levels
(Figure 5D).

In conclusion, we provide the yAT1.03 sensor, which shows more
robust ATP measurements in yeast cells compared to the original AT1.03
sensor and specifically under dynamic conditions. With this sensor,
we could show that ATP dynamics during glycolytic start-up depends
on pregrowth conditions and that isogenic cells show highly heterogeneous
responses during transitions to glucose. We believe that the yAT1.03
sensor will be a useful addition to the current arsenal of tools to
investigate ATP physiology.
