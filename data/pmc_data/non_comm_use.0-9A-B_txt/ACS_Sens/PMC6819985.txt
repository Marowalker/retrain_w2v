This letter reports
on a novel cost-efficient and multifunctional barcode-like
sensors array (BLSA) printed with a conductive bioinspired smart ink. The conductive 
ink (P@G ink), which can be further chemically engineered with different
organic ligands, was generated via facile one-pot hydrothermal reduction
of graphene oxide (GO) in dopamine (DA) as coreductan Usingvarious 
chemical derivatives of the P@G inks on a flexible substrate
(e.g., Kapton), a highly integrated BLSA as well as smart nose/tongue
mimic array were generated for simultaneous sensing and distinguishing
of complex physical and chemical stimuli, including temperature, light,
air pressure, relative humidity, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Since common real applications
are usually presented in/as mixture of stimuli,1 it is particularly appealing and important to unveil multifunctional
(or multiparametric) sensing systems that allow simultaneous sensing
and differentiation of different chemical stimuli (e.g., humidity
and volatile organic compounds, VOCs) and physical stimuli (e.g.,
temperature and pressure).2 In recent
years, many examples of multifunctional sensing techniques have been
proven in multifarious aspects, such as wearable electronics,3 humanoid robotics,4 precision agriculture,5 and health monitoring.6 Field effect transistor (FET)/chemiresistor-based
electronics integrated with the capacity of functional nanomaterials
(e.g., carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticles, etc.) have been fabricated
as both solid-state and flexible and/or stretchable sensors for multifunctional
sensing.7−11 Although great progress has been made, sophisticated complexity
(e.g., designs and/or techniques) is often required and considerable
costs are incurred in the fabrication process of most electronic sensors,
posing certain barriers to their widespread application.12 It therefore remains a long-standing scientific
and technological challenge to promote high-performance multifunctional
electronics with low-cost materials and/or fabrication, easy operating
principles, facile interpreted outputs, good reproducibility, and
simple/rapid scalable implementation.

To lessen the complexity
and costs that accompany the routine procedures
of electronic device fabrication, emerging printed/written electronics
and epidermal electronics (electronic tattoos) utilizing functional
inks now provide researchers with numerous options,13−15 opening the
way to rapid and sustainable low-cost fabrication of systems for many
different applications including flexible sensors, photodetectors,
displays, logic circuits, portable batteries, and radiofrequency identification
(RFID) tags.16−19 In general, silver-based nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials,
and their derivatives are frequently used as functional inks in these
applications.20,21 It is highly desirable that ink
technologies would incorporate other functional materials for sprouting
novel smart inks with multiple concurrent functions. In nature, there
are hugely well-adapted structures and materials with unique properties
and/or functionalities. For instance, the cuttlefish (a type of mollusc)
releases a diffuse cloud of ink from its glands as an escape mechanism
against predators. This ink is a mixed electronic–protonic
material, in part made up of melanin (an indole-based natural pigment).22 The mussel (another mollusc) has extraordinarily
secure adhesion to diverse substrates, even to wet surfaces, due to
adhesive foot proteins, which is also shared with the catecholic nature
of melanin-like cuttlefish ink.23 In learning
from nature, melanin and melanin-related biopolymers (e.g., polydopamine)
as functional materials have now been involved in many excellent biochemical
and biomedical applications.24 Enlightened
by this approach, developing and mining bioinspired materials with
tailored properties/functions gives us the potential to find unprecedented
concepts for the development of new electronic applications.

In this study, we present fundamentally fascinating writing
electronics for multifunctional sensing via the combination of a conductive
bioinspired smart ink and a creative design of a barcode-like sensor
array (BLSA). The smart ink can be readily prepared in batches, easily
engineered with tailor-made interfaces, and universally written on
suitable low-cost substrates (e.g., Kapton) to build flexible BLSAs,
which can act as distinguishing signal indicators of many different
stimuli (i.e., temperature, light exposure, relative humidity, air
pressure, and VOCs). The present study should greatly underpin scalable
and cost-effective development of wearable and portable electronic
devices for the future.

Conductive ink is chosen for our
proposed barcode-like
sensor array (BLSA) due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility
for large-scale production. Moreover, it can be readily dispersed
in green chemical solvents, possesses good tailoring performances,
and coats different substrates well in a binder-free format. Thus,
the development of BLSA begins with the fabrication of an appropriate
smart ink. In this respect, we have employed a simple one-pot hydrothermal
reduction of graphene oxide (GO) in dopamine (DA) as coreductant to
fabricate a bioinspired smart ink (P@G ink), as referred to in our
recent work,2 which can be easily dispersed
in ethanol. As a control, reduced GO (rGO) and polydopamine (PDA)
were prepared under the same condition as P@G ink. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the morphology of GO, rGO,
PDA, and P@G ink (Figure S1). The colloidal
viscosity property of P@G ink was further examined by a rheometer.
The P@G ink (4 mg mL–1) showed a viscosity of 2.16–0.01
Pa·s at the range of 0.01–500 s–1 shear
rate (Figure S2). We verified that P@G
ink is excellent for coating frequently used substrates (e.g., Kapton,
a commercially available polyimide film) without any need for additional
surface treatment (Figure 1a). Moreover, rapid drying is achieved with ethanol as the
eco-friendly solvent, and the binder-free style of P@G ink is also
of significant advantage over other reported inks regarding the issue
of high-speed, green-chemical, and large-scale fabrication of flexible
resistors18,19,21 (Figure 1b). With the assistance
of commercially available copper tapes as the alignment, P@G ink can
be written onto Kapton pieces to unveil controlled variable-width
barcode-like stripes (Figure 1c). More interestingly, thanks to its unveiled biosafety,2 P@G ink can be written on fingernails (Figure 1d) or skin (Figure S3) as a conductive tattoo, which is waterproof
(Figure S3) and wearable (>3 days).
The
waterproof and wearable capabilities of P@G ink tattoos can result
from the strong affinity of the mussel-inspired PDA matrix with the
rGO.24 Apart from the smart coating/writing
properties of P@G ink discussed above, the integration of conductivity
also offers the P@G ink-written substrates as electronics with sensory
characteristics. As a proof-of-concept design, fingernail writings
with P@G ink are prepared and linked with wires (Figure 1d) to act as a wearable sensory
electronics to different stimuli, such as breath (Figure 1e) and UV exposure (Figure 1f), owing to the
thermoconductivity and photoconductivity of rGO as a component.25,26

We must bear in mind
that P@G ink-written electronics can respond
differently to many stimuli. Since many common stimuli are among the
complexity met in real life, the main concern lies in the effective
classification and identification of each stimulus. To address this
issue, array-based “chemical nose/tongue” sensing approaches,
analogous to mammalian olfaction and tasting,27 would work by discriminating a distinct pattern of responses
generated by the analytes, leading to a fingerprint for the classification
and identification of each analyte. The array-based nose/tongue-mimic
strategy depends on the interactions between multiple reporter elements
and the analytes of interest.28,29 Our P@G ink can be
developed as multiple reporters, because the catechol in its PDA matrix
is reactive and can be easily oxidized into quinone under basic conditions.
As shown in Figure S4, the resultant quinone
can react with thiol-containing chemicals by a pathway of Michael
addition, and amine-containing chemicals by means of a Schiff base
reaction/Michael addition in a simple and facile mix-and-react manner
at room temperature.24

Five organic
ligands including 2 thiol-containing small molecules
(T1, T2), 2 amine-containing small molecules
(N1, N2), and one amine-containing polymer (P)
were chosen for engineering the surface of P@G ink (Table S1). The surface morphology of the dried inks was characterized
by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figure S5). The results reveal that the different ligands can significantly
influence the surface structure of dried inks, and the resultant surfaces
have distinct water contact angles (CA) (Figure S6). It has been reported that the performances of nanoparticle-based
electronic sensors can be tuned by modification of ligands with different
types or chain lengths with regard to temperature, volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), etc.12 Thus, chemical
ligand capped P@G inks were tailored to contain adequate chemical
diversity for the development of a nose/tongue-mimic array regarding
both physical (e.g., temperature) and chemical stimuli (e.g., VOCs).
As demonstrated in Figure 1c, P@G ink was written with precise alignment on many substrates.
Predictably, different chemically modified P@G inks written on a single
piece of a substrate in barcode style would spark a novel planar sensor
array, representing an integrated strategy to train its sensory responses
to multiple stimuli. Thus, an innovative barcode-like sensors array
(BLSA) was developed by P@G ink and 5 ligand-modified P@G inks (T1-P@G, T2-P@G, N1-P@G, N2-P@G,
and P-P@G) written on a Kapton film (Figure 2).

Figure 2 (a–c) Images giving examples of the design
and fabrication
of a 6-lane BLSA by different inks integrated on a Kapton film. (d)
BLSA fixed onto an electronic board for testing.

The multifunctional sensing abilities of BLSA to physical and chemical
stimuli (temperature, light exposure, air pressure, RH, and VOCs)
were systematically investigated (Figure 3 and Figures S7–S11). Full details of the experiments and data analysis are set out
in the Supporting Information. Figure 3 shows that each
type of stimulus has its own highly individual color-change barcode
pattern of resistance responses using chemically modified P@G inks
as the sensor array. Note that the selected chemical ligands play
an important role; for instance, P–P@G ink sensor has stronger
responses to all the indicated stimuli compared with the other chemically
modified P@G ink sensors, which may be attributed to the polymer ligand
(polyethylenimine) used having a higher molecular weight and volume
for better tuning of the responsiveness of these P@G inks. Hence,
P@G inks modified with distinct chemical ligands and linked to the
design of BLSA, as a new type of pattern recognition element, can
effortlessly generate substantial stimulus-relevant pattern responses
for further sensing applications.

Figure 3 Heat maps represent the responses of BLSA
to temperature (a), light
exposure (b), air pressure (c), relative humidity (d), and volatile
organic compounds (e).

To differentiate the
resulting patterns of BLSA for each stimulus,
principal component analysis (PCA, a powerful computational technique)30 was used (Figures S7–S12). Five replicates of resistance responses were recorded for each
stimulus with different degrees against BLSA, and then dealt with
PCA to yield 3 canonical factors, which denoted linear combinations
of the resistivity-response matrix (6 barcode-like ink sensors ×
the number of analytes × 5 replicates). The 2 most significant
factors were then used to create a 2D plot (Figures S7d, S8d, S9c, S10d, S11b, and S12c), in which each point represents
the response pattern for an individual stimulus sample against BLSA.
From the results, each stimulus with varied degrees is clearly distinguished
in this BLSA pattern recognition system, confirming the feasibility
of BLSA as a novel and smart chemical nose/tongue. Since the second
discriminant factor (PC2) is <40%, it is possible to simply apply
the first discriminant factor (PC1) for quantitatively characterizing
the varying extents of each stimulus (Figures S7e, S8e, S10e, and S12d).

Considerably different responses
were ranges can be found between
the studied stimuli using BLSA (Figures S7a–S11a). In this case, it is envisaged that this BLSA would distinguish
between multiple stimuli by PCA. For this propose, we considered the
pattern responses of all the stimuli together. Figure 4 shows that the canonical resistance–response
patterns from all stimuli (temperature, air pressure, VOCs, RH, and
light exposure) could be effectively clustered into distinct groups
in the independent region of the 2D PCA plot, verifying that the BLSA
ability to distinguish between complex stimuli, permitting
the simultaneous sensing of a range of stimuli. The power of our BLSA
comes from the as-prepared hybrid material, affording superior synergy
between the bioinspired PDA and the rGO, as discussed above. Our proposed
BLSA-based pattern recognition platform would be referentially evolved
to monitor biochemical analytes relating to different responsive biochemical
ligands (e.g., DNA) via PDA’s versatile reactivity, and further
in evaluating their molecular interactions. It is reported that medical
device companies encounter many challenges in matching today’s
technology desires while balancing strong industry cost pressures.
Every feature and every benefit need to be balanced against cost to
make for a successful value-based solution.31 In response to this issue, the highly integrated design and easy-to-write
nature of BLSA on flexible and commercially available Kapton provide
enormous potential for the development of “all-in-one”—yet
low-cost—disposable electronics.

of BLSA’s responses to temperature,
light exposure, air pressure, relative humidity (RH), and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs).

Since there is some overlap between the resistance–response
patterns from the VOCs that were tested in the 2D PCA plots using
BLSA, we used a three-dimensional (3D) PCA plot to fully elucidate
the differences in the VOC-related resistance–response patterns
(Figure 5). Consequently,
the 8 VOCs tested (which included aldehyde, alkane, acid, ketone,
and alcohol listed in Table S2) were clearly
differentiated using BLSA. VOCs are produced in the human body as
products of metabolic processes, and metabolomics analysis of VOCs
(i.e., volatolomics) emitted from biological fluids (breath, skin,
blood, urine, etc.) can be clinically valuable as diagnostic indicators,
this approach being a noninvasive means of identifying different pathologies,
e.g. cancer, diabetes mellitus, wound infection, etc.32,33 From these results, it is expected that the our BLSA would be a
useful tool for these purposes in healthcare applications.

score plot for the response pattern of BLSA as obtained
from PCA against 10 ppm VOCs.

To summarize, we have brought the first design of barcode-like
sensor array (BLSA), written with a conductive bioinspired smart ink
to be of use in multifunctional sensory applications. This smart ink
(P@G ink) results from the integration of a melanin-related biopolymer
(PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) in a one-pot routine reaction. A range
of chemically engineered P@G inks can be written on a flexible substrate
(e.g., Kapton) to configure a novel and highly integrated BLSA. BLSA
is a low-cost yet powerful method of responding to multiple chemical
and physical stimuli, and has the ability to effectively differentiate
between complex stimuli during their simultaneous sensing, especially
in the way that it can discriminate VOCs. Because of these intriguing
features, we expect that the novel P@G ink-based BLSA electronics
will lead to many versatile and meaningful sensing applications, and
inspire further research on bioinspired smart electronics.
