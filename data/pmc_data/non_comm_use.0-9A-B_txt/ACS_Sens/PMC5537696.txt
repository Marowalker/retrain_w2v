Surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence
energy transfer is
employed for sensitive optical readout of a reversible hairpin aptamer
assay that is suitable for continuous monitoring of low-molecular-weight
chemical analytes. A hairpin aptamer specific to adenosine and adenosine
triphosphate with Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophore attached to its 5′
end was anchored via 3′ end thiol to a gold thin film. Molecular
spacers were used to control the distance of the fluorophore from
the surface in the aptamer “off” and “on”
states. The specific binding of the target analyte changes the aptamer
conformation, which alters the distance of the fluorophore from the
gold surface and translates to variations in the detected fluorescence
intensity. The plasmonically mediated fluorescence signal increases
the measured signal-to-noise ratio and allows for real-time observation
of the analyte binding. Theoretical as well as experimental study
of the optical signal dependence on fluorophore orientation, design
of spacers, and angular distribution of collected light is presented
for rational design of the assay. The detected sensor signal increased
by a factor as large as 23 upon switching the aptamer from the “off”
to “on” state due to the hairpin opening associated
with the specific capture of target analyte.

The coupling
of fluorophores
with the confined field of surface plasmons originating from collective
oscillations of the electron density at metallic surfaces offers powerful
means for the amplification of emitted fluorescence light intensity.1,2 The plasmonic confinement is associated with the enhanced intensity
of the electromagnetic field and the local density of optical states
which has been exploited in fluorescence studies of single molecules3 as well as in the measurement on ensembles of
fluorophore-labeled biomolecules.4,5 The interaction
of fluorophore labels with the plasmonically enhanced electromagnetic
field allows an increase of excitation rate and improvement of the
collection yield of emitted fluorescence photons. The combined coupling
of fluorophores at their absorption and emission wavelengths with
propagating surface plasmons (PSPs) on metallic films or localized
surface plasmons (LSPs) at metallic nanoparticles can be engineered
to enhance detected fluorescence intensity by a factor exceeding 3
orders of magnitude.6

In plasmonically
amplified fluorescence assays, biomolecules that
are labeled with fluorophores are affinity captured on a metallic
sensor surface at distances in the range of 15–20 nm at which
the plasmonic fluorescence enhancement typically reaches its maximum.7−9 At shorter distances the quenching becomes dominant and the emitted
florescence signal is attenuated rather than enhanced while at longer
distances the binding events occur outside the evanescent surface
plasmon field. Aptamers become increasingly popular in analytical
technologies for specific capture and sensitive detection of low-molecular-weight
analytes10,11 for which more commonly used antibody immunoassays
are not possible. These versatile building blocks can be employed
in numerous detection formats that take advantage of the measurement
of fluorescence quenching,12 plasmonic
fluorescence enhancement,13 or plasmonic
near-field coupling between metallic nanoparticles.14 Such variety of readout modality is possible through the
flexibility in aptamer design that can be tailored for assays relying
on conformation changes,14 displacement,15 or formation of sandwich16 which are architectures not possible to realize with conventionally
used antibodies against low-molecular-weight analytes. A particularly
interesting aspect of the aptamer flexibility in design is the possibility
of their implementation to molecular beacon-based biosensors. In short,
single-stranded nucleic acids are modified at their opposite ends
with a fluorophore and a quencher and specific analyte binding is
detected by changes in the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity
is mediated by the aptamer analyte complex formation that leads to
structural changes or most commonly displacement of complementary
stem region of a hairpin aptamer, rendering the quencher and fluorophore
pair to separate to a distance farther than energy transfer or quenching
to occur.17

The majority of plasmon
field-enhanced fluorescence assays that
has been pursued with aptamers carrying a fluorophore attached to
their DNA or RNA strand relied on chemically synthesized metallic
nanoparticles that support LSPs. These modes typically confine electromagnetic
energy at distances of few tens of nanometers and they have been used
in fluorescence displacement assays that employ the distance-modulated
plasmonic enhancement18 of fluorescence
signal or quenching.19 In these works,
the difference in the fluorescence signal from the aptamer with and
without analyte captured was typically <6-fold. An aptamer fluorescence
assay that is mediated by PSPs on metallic films has been reported
to offer higher, 18-fold change, of fluorescence intensity upon analyte
binding20 when probed with less confined
PSP field reaching about 100 nm from the metal surface.

This
paper reports on the reversible direct detection of a small
molecule analyte by conformational changes of a hairpin aptamer which
is labeled with a fluorophore and attached to a metallic film supporting
PSP modes. Plasmonic amplification of the fluorescence signal enabled
in situ continuous monitoring of variations in concentration of low-molecular-weight
analytes—adenosine and adenosine triphosphate. By using simulations
and experiments, the rational design of the aptamer molecular spacers
and optical readout is investigated based on the emitted fluorescence
intensity dependence on distance, orientation of the emitter, and
angular range used for the collection of the fluorescence light.

Experimental Section
Materials
Sodium
chloride, tris hydrochloride, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20),
magnesium chloride hexahydrate, adenosine, guanosine, adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP) disodium salt hydrate, and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride
solution (TCEP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Austria). (11-Mercaptoundecyl)triethylene
glycol (PEG-thiol, SPT-0011) was obtained from SensoPath Technologies
(USA). Two DNA aptamers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT-DNA, Leuven, Belgium). The ATP hairpin aptamer with the short
loop sequence (SLA) consisted of Alexa Fluor 647N 5′-CA CCT
GGG GGA GTA TTG CGG AGG AAG GTT PEG6 CCA GGT G-SH 3′ and the
long loop ATP hairpin aptamer (LLA) sequence was Alexa Fluor 647N
5′-CA CCT GGG GGA GTA TTG CGG AGG AAG GTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT
TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT CCA GGT G TT PEG6 -SH 3′. All reagents
were used as received and buffer solutions were prepared using ultrapure
water (Arium Pro, Sartorius Stedim).

Preparation of the Sensor
Chips
A BK7 glass substrate
was coated with 2 nm Cr and 50 nm Au films by thermal vacuum evaporation
(Model HHV FL400, HHV Ltd., UK). The Au surface was rinsed with ethanol,
dried under a stream of air, and stored under argon atmosphere until
use. LLA or SLA aptamer was dissolved at concentration of 1 μM
in 200 μL of 10 mM Tris buffer (pH= 7.4) containing 6 mM MgCl2. Afterward, the aptamer was reacted with 100-fold excess
TCEP (100 μM). After 4 h of incubation, the reduced ATP hairpin
aptamer solution was spiked with PEG-thiol at concentration of 10
μM and the mixture was flowed over the Au surface in a closed
loop system for 2 h in order to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM).

Optical Setup
A schematic of the optical setup can
be seen in Figure 1. The sensor chip with the aptamer biointerface on top was optically
matched to an LASFN9 glass prism by using refractive index matching
oil (from Cargille Inc., USA). The HeNe laser (λex = 632.8 nm, ∼2 mW) beam was transverse magnetically (TM)
polarized by passing through a polarizer (POL) and was coupled to
the prism to resonantly excite the PSPs by the Kretschmann configuration
of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method. The prism and sensor
chip assembly was mounted on a rotation stage to control the angle
of incidence θ and the angular reflectivity spectra R(θ) were measured by a photodiode detector connected
to a lock-in amplifier (EG&G, USA). The enhanced field intensity
occurring upon the coupling to PSPs at a resonant angle θSPR were used to excite Alexa Fluor-647 molecules at the sensor
surface. The fluorescence light emitted at a wavelength around λem = 670 nm to the direction normal to the surface was collected
by a lens (focal length 30 mm, numerical aperture of NA = 0.2), passed
through two bandpass filters (FBF, transmission wavelength λ
= 670 nm, 670FS10–25, Andover Corporation Optical Filter, USA)
and a notch filter (LNF, central stop-band wavelength λ = 632.8
nm, XNF-632.8–25.0M, CVI Melles Griot, USA). Then the fluorescence
light was coupled to a multimode optical fiber (FT400EMT, Thorlabs,
UK) that was connected to an avalanche photodiode photon counter (Count-200-FC,
Laser Components, Germany). Its intensity (F) was
measured by a counter (53131A, Agilent, USA) in counts per second
(cps) and recorded by the software Wasplas (Max Planck Institute for
Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany). During the fluorescence measurements,
the intensity of the laser beam illuminating an area of about 1 mm2 was decreased by using a neutral-density filter (NDF, optical
density OD = 2, Linos Plano Optics) in order to reduce the effect
of fluorophore bleaching. The measurement of reflectivity R and fluorescence intensity F as a function
of time t was performed at an incidence angle θ
that was fixed close to the resonance.

configuration used in the surface plasmon
field-enhanced fluorescence measurements.

Aptamer Assay
A flow-cell with a volume of 10 μL
was clamped to the sensor surface to contain liquid samples transported
via fluidic tubing (Tygon LMT-55) with 0.25 mm inner diameter at a
flow rate of 15 μL/min. The flow-cell consisted of a PDMS gasket
(thickness of ∼130 μm) and a transparent glass substrate
with drilled inlet and outlet ports. Throughout the assay measurements,
10 mM Tris buffer (pH = 7.4) containing 6 mM MgCl2 was
used (further referred to as hairpin aptamer assay buffer—HAB),
which was similar to the buffer condition used during the aptamer
selection process with minor modifications.21 Following the aptamer immobilization, the sensor surface was washed
for 15 min with HAB to establish a stable baseline of the fluorescence
signal F0. Then, a series of samples spiked
with target and reference analytes were sequentially injected. Each
sample was flowed for 3 min during which the sensor signal F(t) reached saturation. For comparison,
a high ionic strength HEPES buffer was used (10 mM HEPES pH = 7.4
containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.005% Tween 20)
for the affinity binding studies besides HAB.

Optical Simulations
Numerical simulations were carried
out in order to determine the light intensity emitted to the far field
by fluorophores that are exposed to the evanescent field of PSPs in
close proximity to a metallic surface. The simulations were performed
by using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method that was
implemented in the package FDTD Solutions (Lumerical Solutions Inc.,
Canada). Fluorophores were represented by an infinitely small dipole
source placed above a plane gold surface at a distance f with the orientation parallel (∥) or perpendicular (⊥)
to the surface. The angular distribution of emitted light intensity
to the far field was determined by using a monitor placed above the
structure. Perfectly matched layer boundary conditions were applied
at all interfaces of a 1 μm × 1 μm × 3.5 μm
simulation volume. A region of 120 nm × 120 nm × 300 nm
around the emitter was studied with a 1 nm mesh, while the remaining
volume was partitioned with a nonuniform conformal mesh. Water, as
background medium surrounding the emitter, was described by a constant
refractive index medium with n = 1.332 and the wavelength-dependent
refractive index of gold was obtained by fitting CRC data.22 In order to determine the emission probability
to the defined numerical aperture NA, the emitted intensity at λem = 670 nm was integrated over the angles falling in the defined
range and normalized with the total emitted power at the same wavelength.
The emission rate to a chosen NA was obtained as a product of emission
probability and excitation rate. The excitation rate of a fluorophore
was assumed proportional to the electric field intensity |E|2 at λex = 633 nm which was
simulated for the resonant coupling to PSPs.

Analysis of Aptamer Conformations
A random-coil approach23 was used based
on a model in which the end-to-end
distance of polymer chain with N elements is determined
as αaN1/2, where a is the length between the monomers and α is a coefficient.
An average distance of a = 0.63 nm was assumed for
nucleic acid monomers24 and a = 0.15 nm for the bonds within PEG segments. The segments of oligonucleotide
strains were assumed to rotate completely freely and thus α
was set to α = 1. For the PEG spacers, α was set to 21/2 to take into account their stiffer chain. It is important
to note that this model neglects a wide range of effects including
repulsive Coulombic interactions (e.g., between negatively charged
bases in the DNA strand and with the negatively charged Alexa Fluor
647N), steric hindrance, or defined DNA strand conformations as a
result of the affinity bound target analyte. Visualizations of possible
conformations of the studied aptamers were created in the Molecular
Operating Environment (MOE, 2013.08, Chemical Computing Group Inc.,
Canada).

Results and Discussion
As seen in Figure 2a, the gold sensor
surface carried a DNA hairpin aptamer anchored
via a thiol group at its 3′ end. The thiol-PEG SAM was used
to dilute the surface density of the aptamer to reduce steric hindrance
during analyte binding and aptamer unfolding, as well as to serve
as an antifouling carpet. The aptamers specific to adenosine and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) were derived from the structure which was reported
to exhibit dissociation constant in the bulk solution of Kd ∼ 6 μM for adenosine.21 In order to utilize a readout strategy based on surface
plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence energy transfer, the 5′
end of the aptamer strand was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647N dye. Seven
bases of the aptamer at two locations close to the 5′ and 3′
ends were designed to be complementary (marked blue in Figure 2a) to form the stem. By using
these sequences, the aptamer forms a hairpin structure with the fluorophore
present close to the metal surface at a distance of foff. The sequence of the stem region close to the 5′
end partially overlaps with the sequence of 22 bases that is specific
to the target analytes adenosine and ATP (analyte specific segment
marked green in Figure 2a). Therefore, the affinity binding of ATP disrupts the hairpin structure
and switches the aptamer to its open conformation state with a fluorophore
present at longer distance fon from the
gold surface. By using molecular spacers between the thiol anchor
and the stem sequence (spacer 1) and between the stem sequence and
the analyte specific sequence (spacer 2), the distance between Au
and Alexa Fluor 647 dyes in the “off” state foff and in the “on” state fon can be tuned in order to achieve a maximum
difference in the detected optical signals.

Figure 2 (a) Schematics of the
aptamer-based assay on the gold sensor surface
that utilizes a fluorophore coupled to surface plasmons (PSP). Short
loop hairpin aptamer (SLA) or long loop hairpin aptamer (LLA) were
anchored at the gold surface via a thiol group at the 3′ end
and their surface density was diluted by using polyethylene glycol-thiol
(PEG). (b) Examples of possible closed hairpin conformations of SLA
(left) and LLA (right) in the absence of analyte and with Alexa Fluor
647 fluorophore attached to the 5′ DNA strand end.

Distance of the Fluorophore from the Surface
Two designs
of ATP aptamers with different molecular spacers 1 and 2 were used.
The long loop aptamer—LLA—carried spacer 1 with 6 PEG
groups and two T bases between the anchor group and the 3′
stem sequence. In addition, spacer 2 composed of 32 T bases was inserted
between the ATP specific sequence and the stem sequence. The second
hairpin aptamer with short loop sequence—SLA—had no
spacer 1 and a shorter spacer 2 (two T bases and 6 PEG groups). To
estimate the distance between the fluorophore and gold surface in
the “off” and “on” states, possible conformations
of the SLA and LLA were analyzed. Two examples of conformations of
the stem region with the fluorophore in the closed hairpin SLA and
LLA can be seen in Figure 2b. The distances of the fluorophore from the metal surface
in the absence foff and the presence fon of the analyte were estimated based on random-coil
model for polymers. For LLA with longer molecular spacers, the average
distance in the closed hairpin conformation was estimated as foff ∼ 1.6 nm and in the open hairpin
conformation as fon ∼ 6.6 nm. In
the closed hairpin conformation, the spacer 1 (6 PEG groups and two
T bases) and linker between the fluorophore and the aptamer were assumed
to be flexible. Similarly, for the SLA the average distances were
estimated as foff ∼ 0.9 nm and fon ∼ 5.2 nm (see summary in Table S1). The range of rotational freedom of
the fluorophore dye attached to SLA and LLA in the foff state is visualized in Figure S1. The Alexa Fluor 647N dye in SLA appears less flexible as
compared to LLA where it possesses a broader range of possible conformational
states (rotational freedom). As in the readout of the assay, the fluorescence
signal F(t) is collected with about
1 s integration time, the orientation of the fluorophore is expected
to be averaged and the mean polar angle is Ξ ∼ 60°
for both “off” and “on” states when the
fluorophore is free to rotate. For SLA in the closed hairpin, the
fluorophore is in close proximity to the gold surface which may sterically
hinder its rotation and thus a parallel orientation is likely preferred,
Ξ > 60° (note that a parallel orientation of the dipole
corresponds to Ξ = 90° and the perpendicular orientation
to Ξ = 0°).

Simulations of Competing Plasmonic Enhancement
and Quenching
The optical response of Alexa Fluor 647N to
conformation changes
of the investigated SLA and LLA aptamers between the closed and open
hairpin states were numerically simulated by FDTD. As Figure 3a shows, PSPs probe the gold–water
interface with a characteristic profile of the electromagnetic field
that evanescently decays away from the gold surface with a penetration
depth of about Lp = 190 nm (defined as
the distance from the surface at which the field amplitude |E| decreases by a factor of e). In addition, it shows that
the field component |E⊥|2 that is perpendicular to the surface is enhanced by a factor of
about 35 with respect to that of the incident field component. The
intensity of the parallel component |E∥|2 is approximately 5 times lower than that of the perpendicular
one |E⊥|2.

field intensity upon the resonant excitation of PSP at λex = 633 nm depending on distance from the surface f. (b) Emission probability for a dipole representing the
fluorophore emitting at λem = 670 nm to a cone above
the gold surface with NA = 0.2 and NA = 1 as a function of distance f and dipole orientation. (c) Emission rate of a fluorophore
emitting to NA = 0.2 at λem = 670 nm that is excited
via PSPs at λex = 633 nm for its parallel and perpendicular
orientation and varied distance f.

In general, the radiation of fluorescence emitter
placed above
the plane interface between gold and water can be quenched, coupled
via the near field to PSPs traveling along the gold surface, or it
can be emitted to the far field. The total emission probability to
the far field (represented by numerical aperture NA = 1) from a radiating
dipole above the gold surface is close to 1 at long distances and
it rapidly drops when decreasing the distance f below
15 nm, see Figure 3b. These data also reveal that the emitter oriented parallel (∥)
to the gold emits to the far field with smaller probability than that
with perpendicular orientation (⊥). Interestingly, this behavior
is opposite if light is only collected to a narrow cone of angles
close to the normal direction. The reason for the stronger emission
probability from the parallel dipole (that is more quenched) into
the normal direction is that emission occurs dominantly in the direction
normal to dipole oscillation. Let us note that for the in situ measurement
of fluorescence signal through a flow-cell, the numerical aperture
NA of lens used for the collecting of fluorescence light is limited
as it cannot approach close to the sensor surface. The value used
herein of NA = 0.2 holds for typically used configurations in diffraction
as well as ATR-based plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence biosensors.25

Figure 3c presents
the emission rate of fluorophore that is coupled by the resonantly
excited PSPs waves at wavelength λex which occurs
in a narrow angular range within NA = 0.2. It shows that the difference
between the emission probability from parallel (∥) and perpendicularly
(⊥) oriented emitter is partially compensated by the stronger
excitation of perpendicular dipoles (see |E⊥|2 in Figure 3a) than parallel dipoles (see |E∥|2 in Figure 3a). For short distances (1 < f < 15
nm), the emission rate rapidly increases with increasing distance
similar to the emission probability as the PSP field decays slowly.
However, when increasing the distance f toward the
PSP penetration depth, the emission rate decreases with the distance
as the excitation field gets substantially weaker. In summary, simulations
predict that fluorescence intensity detected from a fluorophore that
is placed at the distance f < 15 nm and excited
with enhanced PSP field is more than an order of magnitude stronger
for the parallel dipole orientation (∥) than for the perpendicular
orientation (⊥). The emitted fluorescence intensity rapidly
increases with the distance f. For the estimated
changes in the distance of randomly oriented emitter attached to LLA,
the simulated intensity increase for the distance switch from foff = 1.6 nm to fon = 6.6 nm is a factor of about 45. For the SLA aptamer with preferably
parallel oriented dye in the closed hairpin conformation, slightly
lower fluorescence signal change of about 40 is predicted when the
distance changes from foff = 0.9 nm to fon = 5.2 nm.

Measurement of Plasmon
Field-Enhanced Fluorescence Energy Transfer
Aptamer Assay
As seen in Figure 4a, the resonant excitation of PSPs at λex manifests itself as a narrow resonant dip in the reflectivity
spectrum R(θ). Interestingly, the measured
reflectivity spectra did not show significant shift of the SPR dip
located at θSPR upon the binding of ATP which increases
refractive index on the surface and also leads to its redistribution
due to the conformation change of the aptamer. The lack of SPR signal
to such variations can be ascribed to two effects. First, ATP exhibits
low molecular weight (507.2 Da) which translates to weak increase
in refractive index that is proportional to δθSPR. Second, the switching of the aptamer from its closed to open loop
conformation by the capture of ATP should lead to counteracting small
decrease in θSPR. Decrease of SPR angle by about
δθSPR = 0.01–0.02° was reported
for swelling of polymer brushes with molecular weight 50–3000
kDa26 which was attributed to increase
in their thickness and accompanied decrease in refractive index. The
switching of the aptamer structure should lead to similar effects,
but as its molecular weight of 22.6 kDa is lower, the respective SPR
changes are expected to be weaker.

Figure 4 (a) Angular SPR reflectivity spectra R(θ)
and (b) respective fluorescence intensity spectra F(θ) measured for a sensor surface in contact with HAB buffer
spiked with the concentration of ATP of 0, 1, 5, and 10 mM. The gold
sensor surface was functionalized with LLA.

In the surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence regime,
the
resonant coupling to PSPs leads to the excitation of attached Alexa
Fluor 647 dyes which can be seen as a strong peak in the fluorescence
intensity F centered at an angle θ slightly
lower than that where SPR occurs (see Figure 4b). Interestingly, the maximum fluorescence
intensity occurs at angle θ that is slightly lower than that
where the minimum reflectivity occurs. Such small angular shift can
be attributed to the interference between the laser beam, that directly
reflects from the gold layer and undergoes a phase shift and the resonantly
excited surface plasmon waves that are leaky to the substrate. When
incubating the sensor surface with the ATP target analyte, an increase
in the fluorescence signal F is observed. This is
caused by a change in the aptamer conformation that leads to an increase
in the distance of the emitter from the surface f and reduced effect of quenching. Experimental measurements with
SLA show 10.3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity for 12 mM ATP
in comparison to the measurement taken in the absence of analyte,
while for LLA, a stronger 23.3-fold increased fluorescence intensity
was observed. For the SLA, this value is about 4-fold lower than predicted
and for the LLA aptamer, the measured value is about 2-fold lower
than predicted. These discrepancies can be attributed to inaccuracy
of the model, particularly to the simplified means of determining
the distances in the open and closed hairpin conformation and approximations
used in the FDTD simulations where the size of the real emitter (of
about 2 nm) was replaced by an infinitely small dipole.

Real-Time Detection
of the Reversible Aptamer Interaction with
Target Analyte
For the experimental observation of affinity
interaction with tethered aptamers, the angle of incidence was set
close to θSPR= 57° (where the strongest fluorescence
signal amplification occurs) and the fluorescence intensity was measured
as a function of time F(t). As can
be seen from Figure 5, the injection of the HAB spiked with ATP leads to a rapid increase
in the fluorescence signal F. Increasing the ATP
concentration from 0.9 μM to 12 mM leads to a gradual increase
in equilibrium signal F. Exposure to the highest
concentration followed by rinsing in buffer (without the analyte)
resulted in a rapid dissociation of the ATP-aptamer complex that manifests
itself as a drop of the fluorescence signal to the original baseline
value F0. This observation confirms a
fully reversible aptamer interaction for repeated measurements without
regeneration. Moreover, virtually no bleaching of attached dyes was
observed over the time course of the experiment. The aptamer assay
showed a comparable reversible response for the detection of adenosine,
but no observable response was recorded for the negative control—guanosine—which
is a structural analogue of adenosine. The data for the long LLA ligand
shown in Figure 5 were
similar for the SLA (Figure S2).

Figure 5 Example of
the fluorescence signal F(t) measured
at a fixed angle θ = 57° during titration of
ATP, adenosine, and guanosine at concentration increments up to 12
mM in HAB buffer. Gold sensor surface was functionalized with LLA.

Calibration Curves
From the data of the titration measurements,
the equilibrium response F was obtained for each
analyte concentration. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined
as the concentration at which the calibration curve intersects with
the value of the background signal F0 plus
3 times the standard deviation, 3σ(F0).

For SLA, the determined LOD for ATP was 108 μM and
24 μM for adenosine. This was greatly improved by the LLA where
LOD values were ∼1–2 μM for both ATP and adenosine.
The obtained detection limits of the sensor is within the reported
values in the literature, that ranges over several orders of magnitude
(ATP detection limits from 0.5 pM27 up
to 0.65 mM28) for a plethora of fluorescence
detection schemes.29,30 Although our reported sensor
may fall in the low sensitivity range, it is comparable to surface
supported real-time detection sensors31,32 and has the
added value of effortless reversible detection. As can be seen in Figure 6a, the baseline fluorescence
intensity is higher for the interface with LLA compared to that for
SLA. This can be attributed to its longer distance in the “off”
aptamer state—foff—(see Table S1) which is accompanied by higher emission
rate (see Figure 3c).
In addition, Kd values were determined
from the calibration curves fitted with Langmuir isotherm model (presented
in the Supporting Information) and the Kd for adenosine was of 90 μM for SLA and
of 50 μM for LLA (Figures S3a,b).
The calibration curves for ATP in both aptamers deviated from the
Langmuir isotherm (Figure 6a). However, fitting the calibration curve for ATP concentrations
up to 2 mM, where initial slight saturation was seen (Figure 5a), yields Kd values of 300 μM and 120 μM for SLA and
LLA (Figure S3c,d), respectively. These
values are probably increased by either the interaction of the strongly
negatively charged molecule ATP with the surface-anchored aptamer
that carries also negatively charged fluorophore, possibly affecting
its orientation. It is worth of noting that the overall reduced affinity
of fluorophore labeled aptamers with respect to the unmodified one
was reported previously.33,34 Besides the molecular
charge mentioned above, surface and label induced reduction in affinity
of the aptamer, the competition of target-induced conformational change
from the initial closed hairpin state is a likely contributor.

and adenosine analytes. Each data points (ΔF) derived from triplicate titration measurements (an example shown
in Figure 4). (a) Comparison
of the response for LLA and SLA aptamers and analyte dissolved in
HAB buffer. (b) Comparison of the response for LLA aptamer and analytes

It was reported that the ATP binding aptamer can be described
using
a “conformational selection” recognition of ATP where
the analyte-free state is more stable in high salt concentration,
which leads to a deteriorated distinction of conformational changes
when ATP is bound.35 Therefore, the assay
buffer (HAB) used in this study did not contain NaCl, in order to
increase the contrast between aptamer conformations in analyte-free/hydridized
and analyte bound states. However, it is important to observe the
performance of the assay in buffers with compositions similar to samples
relevant to applications in the field of medical diagnostics. For
this purpose, HEPES buffer (HB) with salt concentration close to physiological
conditions was used to evaluate LLA. Fluorescence intensity changes
resulting from increasing analyte concentrations, in both HAB and
HB, for both ATP and adenosine analytes can be seen in Figure 6b. The baseline fluorescence
intensity F0 of the sensor with HB is
around 4-fold higher (F0 HB ≈
11 × 103 cps and F0 HAB ≈ 3 × 103 cps); nevertheless the assay can
be seen to perform similarly in terms of dynamic range for the detection
of adenosine in both buffers. However, for ATP detection, saturation
of sensor response is reached earlier in HB at 2 mM ATP, which is
in contrast to 12 mM ATP for HAB and the peak intensity in HB is lower
than for HAB. This decreased signal to background ratio and higher F0 can be attributed to the influence of high
salt concentration in HB, that leads to an analyte-free folded aptamer
conformation and consequently lower structural change in the ATP bound
state.

Conclusions
A DNA aptamer sequence
specific to ATP was utilized in a plasmon
field-enhanced reversible assay based on fluorescence energy transfer.
The presented work demonstrates that the reversible interaction of
a fluorophore-labeled aptamer with low-molecular-weight target analytes—adenosine
and ATP—can be sensitively monitored in real time by plasmon
field-enhanced fluorescence light intensity. The optical simulations
qualitatively agree with the measured dependence of fluorescence light
intensity on conformational changes of the used aptamers and they
allowed ascribing the observed effects to variations in the fluorophore
orientation and distance from the surface controlled by the molecular
spacers. The plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence is shown to offer
the advantage of continuous probing of aptamer capturing the target
analyte for more than 1 h without bleaching of the dye, with a limit
of detection of 1 μM. The observed design rules may provide
leads to prepare more sensitive and robust assays that take advantage
of versatile aptamer recognition elements and coupling with the confined
field of surface plasmons in various optical configurations.
