Uranium
is one of the most common radioactive contaminants in the
environment. As a major nuclear material in production, environmental
samples (like soil and groundwater) can provide signatures on uranium
production activity inside the facility. Thus, developing a new and
portable analytical technology for uranium in aqueous media is significant
not only for environmental monitoring, but also for nonproliferation.
In this work, a label-free method for the detection of uranyl (UO22+) ions is developed by monitoring the translocation
of a peptide probe in a nanopore. Based on the difference in the number
of peptide events in the absence and presence of uranyl ions, nanomolar
concentration of UO22+ ions could be detected
in minutes. The method is highly selective; micromolar concentrations
of Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Th4+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ would not interfere with the detection of UO22+ ions. In addition, simulated water samples were
successfully analyzed.

==== Body
Because of
uranium mining, nuclear
power production, nuclear weapon development, as well as other industrial
and medical application, uranium has been one of the most common radioactive
contaminants in the environment, which raises concerns about its environmental
impact and risk for human health.1,2 For example,
UO22+ can disturb organ function by accumulating
in the skeleton, kidneys, lungs, and liver.3−7 In aqueous solutions, uranium can exist in four different
oxidation states such as +3, +4, +5, and +6, but uranyl (UO22+) and its complexing ions are the most stable and common
species. Thus, far, various analytical techniques have been utilized
to detect uranyl ions, including radiospectrometry,8 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,9 fluorescence,10 and
colorimetric11,12 and complexometric titration.13 However, most of these techniques are laborious,
time-consuming, and require the use of sophisticated instruments or
fluorescent labels/dyes. In addition, environmental samples like soil
and groundwater near a uranium processing facility can provide significant
signatures about its production activities inside the facility, and
to detect such early signatures at declared or undeclared areas is
significant for preventing nuclear materials from the wrong people.14 Therefore, development of other fundamentally
different techniques, which are especially label-free, easy to operate,
and potentially field-deployable, for uranyl detection is highly desirable
not only for environmental monitoring but also for nonproliferation
of nuclear materials or weapons.

Nanopore stochastic sensing
has attracted substantial interest
as an emerging label-free and amplification-free technique for measuring
single molecules.15−18 Under an applied voltage bias, the movement of an analyte in a nanopore
produces a measurable ionic current blockage. The identity and the
concentration of the analyte could be revealed from its characteristic
current signatures such as the event residence time, amplitude, frequency,
and even the shape of the blockage.19 In
addition to its biosensing application,20−29 nanopore sensing technology has been successfully applied to study
a variety of other research areas, for example, covalent and noncovalent
bonding interactions,30,31 biomolecular folding and unfolding,32−35 and enzyme kinetics.36−38 It should be noted that nanopore biosensing is generally
achieved by modifying the nanopore interior to introduce binding sites
for molecular recognition of target analytes.39−43 Recently, Long et al. utilized the effect from electrochemical
confined space to efficiently convert the single DNA/peptide characteristics
into measurable electrochemical signatures with high temporal and
current resolution, which has been successfully achieved in the study
of the heterogeneous structure–function relationship of biomolecules.44−46 More recently, Wang and co-workers reported a coordination chemistry-based
stochastic nanopore sensing method for the detection of Cu2+ ions by using a peptide as a ligand probe.47 The detection was based on the effect of Cu2+ on peptide
translocation in a nanopore. Briefly, in the absence of Cu2+, the translocation of the copper-chelating agent in the nanopore
produced only one major type of event. In contrast, in the presence
of Cu2+ ions, they interacted with the copper-chelating
agent to form copper chelates, which produced a new type of events
in the nanopore. By taking advantage of these new events, quantitative
detection of Cu2+ ions could be achieved.

In this
work, based on the similar metal ion-chelating agent interaction
principle but with a different detection mechanism, we developed a
new nanopore method for the detection of UO22+ in aqueous media. We also investigated the effect of metal ions
on the detection of UO22+. The results demonstrated
that this nanopore detection method is highly sensitive and selective
to UO22+ in aqueous media, and the presence
of Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Th4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ showed little impact on its detection and quantification.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Reagents
Peptide HH14, a 14-amino-acid
peptide with a sequence of HHHHHHKHHHYHHH, was obtained
from WatsonBio sciences (Houston, TX). Other chemicals such as UO2(NO3)2 (99.999%), Ca(NO3)2 (99.999%), Mg(NO3)2 (99.999%), Ni(NO3)2 (99.999%), Zn(NO3)2 (99.999%),
Cu(NO3)2 (99.999%), Cd(NO3)2 (99.999%), Pb(NO3)2 (99.999%), Hg(NO3)2 (99.999%), Th(NO3)4 (99.999%),
NaCl (99.999%), HCl (ACS reagent, ≤1 ppm heavy metals), NaH2PO4 (BioXtra grade, ≥99.5%), H3PO4 (ACS reagent, ≤0.002% heavy metals), C2H3NaO2 (BioXtra grade, ≥99.0%),
CH3CO2H (ACS reagent, ≥99.7%), NaC6H7O7 (≥99%), C6H8O7 (FG, ≥99.5%), and Trizma base (BioXtra
grade, ≥99.9%) were bought from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All
the chemicals, including the HH14 peptide, were dissolved
in HPLC-grade water (ChromAR, Mallinckrodt Baker). The stock solutions
of the peptide and metal salts were prepared at concentrations of
10 mM each, and were kept at −20 °C before and after use.
The buffer solutions used in this study included: (1) 1.0 M NaCl and
10 mM tris with pH values adjusted to 6.5 and 7.5 using HCl; (2) 1.0
M NaCl and 10 mM NaH2PO4 with pH values adjusted
to 4.5 and 5.5 using H3PO4; (3) 1.0 M NaCl and
10 mM CH3COONa with pH values adjusted to 4.5 and 5.5 using
CH3COOH; and (4) 1.0 M NaCl and 10 mM NaC6H7O7 “sodium citrate” with pH values
adjusted to 4.5 and 5.5 using C6H8O7 “citric acid”. Lipid 1,2-diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine
was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Teflon film
was obtained from Goodfellow (Malvern, PA). The α-hemolysin
(αHL) (M113F)7 protein pores was made according to
our previous work.48

Electrical
Recording and Data Analysis
Single channel
recordings were carried out at 24 ± 1 °C in a two-compartment
chamber, which is separated by a Teflon septum having a 150 μm
diameter aperture (refer to Supporting Information, Figure S1, for a schematic illustration of the nanopore sensor
system). Briefly, the planar bilayer was formed on the aperture of
the Teflon film using 1,2-diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine. Unless otherwise
noted, the experiments were performed under symmetrical buffer conditions,
with the αHL proteins added to the grounded cis compartment, while metal ion salts and the peptide probe were introduced
to the trans side of the chamber device. Currents
were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA), filtered with a built-in four-pole low-pass Bessel
filter at 10 kHz, and then sampled at 50 kHz with a Digidata 1440
A/D converter (Molecular Devices).

The signatures of current
blockage events were obtained using Clampfit 10.5 software (Molecular
Device). Specifically, the conductance values and the mean residence
time (τoff) for the HH14 peptide were
derived from the amplitude and the residence time histograms by fitting
the distributions to Gaussian and single exponential functions, respectively.31 The change (Δn) in the
number of peptide HH14 events after addition of metal ions,
including UO22+, to the solution was calculated
by using the equation Δn = n0 – n1, where n0 represented the number of HH14 events
in the absence of metal ions, while n1 depicted the number of peptide HH14 events in the presence
of metal ions. Therefore, a positive value of Δn indicated a reduction in the number of peptide events after addition
of metal ions to the solution. Each single-channel current trace was
recorded for 10 min. At least three separate experiments, in each
of which a new protein nanopore was used, were performed for each
sample.

Results and Discussion
Detection of UO22+ Ions Using Peptide
HH14
Peptides possess a range of potential donor
atoms, and are very effective ligands for a variety of metal ions
with high specificities. As a noted example, the amyloid beta (Aβ)
peptides, which is crucially involved in Alzheimer’s disease,
binds Cu2+ ions in vitro, and binding results in aggregation
of the Aβ peptide. In particular, it is well documented that
the histidine and cystine residues in the peptide display strong affinity
for divalent or trivalent metal ions due to the chelation/coordination
interaction.49 Since uranyl ions themselves
could not produce any current modulation events in the nanopore (Supporting Information, Figure S2), in order
to detect UO22+, we utilized a 14-amino-acid
peptide (i.e., HH14) as the ligand probe. The three histidines
in the 6-, 13-, and 14-positions of the peptide HH14 sequences
were designed based on the finding that, in the Cu(II)-Aβ complex,
the Cu2+ ions were coordinated by three histidine amino
acids (i.e., His-6, His-13, and His-14) in the Aβ peptide.49 The other nine histidines were introduced to
increase the coordination possibility between the peptide ligand and
the target metal ion. Similar to the Cu2+ sensor reported
previously, the peptide probe HH14 produced only one major
type of event (Figure 1a). However, unlike the Cu2+ sensor, no new events were
observed after addition of UO22+ to the peptide
solution. Instead, the number of peptide events decreased. Furthermore,
we noticed that, with an increase in the concentration of added UO22+, the peptide events become fewer and fewer.
Specifically, when 0.5 μM UO22+ ions were
added to the peptide HH14 (40 μM) solution, the number
of peptide events decreased by 56.5 ± 2.4% (Figure 1b). As the concentration of
uranyl ions increased to 10 μM, 92.8 ± 2.2% of the HH14 peptide events disappeared (Figure 1c). Since the I–V curves of HH14, UO22+, and their mixtures showed that the existence of uranyl in the nanopore
did not rectify ionic current (Supporting Information, Figure S3), one possible reason for our observation that addition
of UO22+ to the peptide HH14 solution
did not produce new types of events, but only decreased the peptide
event count is because the interactions between peptide HH14 and uranyl ions led to formation of UO22+–HH14 complexes, which passed through the nanopore too rapidly
to be captured by the nanopore sensor (∼200 μs resolution).
Note that the isoelectric point of histidine is around 7.5, while
that of lysine is ∼9.7. Therefore, under our experimental conditions,
peptide HH14 was positively charged. After chelation with
UO22+, the net positive charge of the peptide-uranyl
ion complex increased, and hence, the complex would be electrophoretically
driven through the nanopore more rapidly than the uncomplexed peptide.
Alternatively, the metal ion–peptide complexes might have
larger molecular sizes than the nanopore opening so that they could
not enter and pass through the pore. However, stoichiometric consideration
of the UO22+–HH14 interaction
could not explain such a large (56.5%) reduction in the peptide HH14 events after addition of 0.5 μM to 40 μM HH14. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering experiment (data
not shown) demonstrated that uranyl would not induce HH14 aggregation. Therefore, the most likely mechanism behind our finding
was that the binding of uranyl to the peptide HH14 enabled
other uncomplexed peptide molecules to undergo conformational change.
It is worth mentioning that disappearance of the biomolecule events
or change in the event signatures due to conformational change has
been reported previously.35,44,50

were performed at +100 mV with the (M113F)7 αHL pore
in an electrolyte solution containing 1.0 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris·HCl
(pH 6.5). Both the peptide and uranyl ions were added to the trans compartment of the nanopore sensing chamber. Dashed
lines represent the levels of zero current.

pH Effect on the Sensitivity of the Nanopore Sensor
Nanopore
sensor usually has an extremely low background, and hence
increasing the peptide HH14 event frequency in the nanopore
offers the potential to greatly improve the detection limit for UO22+ quantitation. It has been well documented that
the electrolyte pH affects the properties such as conductance and
ion selectivity of the protein pores.51−53 Therefore, a change
in the pH of the electrolyte solution may influence peptide translocation
in the nanopore, thus affecting the sensor sensitivity and resolution.
Note that nanopore experiments are usually carried out at/near the
physiology pH. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that, as the
electrolyte pH decreased, not only did the event frequency and residence
time of target analytes (e.g., biomolecules and terrorist agents)
increase, but the contrast in the event signatures between the target
analyte and other matrix components also improved.54,55 On the other hand, it is well-known that the coordination properties
of a histidine residue within a peptide sequence depend enormously
on its position in a peptide chain; further, the metal-peptide complexes
formed can exist in a variety of conformations that are dependent
not only on the concentrations of both the peptide and metal ion but
also on the pH of the reaction medium.56−58 To achieve highly sensitive
detection of UO22+, translocation of peptide
HH14 in the αHL nanopore was carried out in a series
of electrolyte solutions with different pH values (from pH 4.5 to
7.5) and different buffer components. Our experimental results (Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Table S1) showed that,
as the pH value of the electrolyte solution decreased from pH 7.5
to pH 4.5, the frequency and the mean residence time of the peptide
events decreased by ∼10-fold and ∼60-fold, respectively.
The results were not unreasonable considering the net charges of peptide
HH14 at these various pH values. As discussed in the previous
section, the isoelectric point of histidine is ∼7.5, while
that of lysine is ∼9.7. Therefore, in our various investigated
buffer solutions of different pH values (from pH 4.5 to pH 7.5), peptide
HH14 had net positive charges. By systematic calculation
of the charge state of HH14 (Supporting Information, Table S2), we found that peptide HH14 had a +1.05, +4.05, +10.31, and +12.69 charge at pH 7.5, pH 6.5,
pH 5.5, and pH 4.5, respectively. Therefore, under a positively applied
potential bias, in theory, a decrease in the pH of the electrolyte
solution would lead to a decrease in the peptide event residence time
and an increase in the peptide event frequency. However, due to the
resolution of the single channel recording setup, most of the rapid
peptide events (e.g., at pH 4.5 and pH 5.5) were missed under our
experimental conditions. The electrolyte buffer solution of pH 6.5
rather than pH 7.5 was used in the remaining experiments because a
larger percent reduction in the number of peptide events after addition
of uranyl ion (1 μM) to the peptide solution (10 μM) was
obtained at this pH. Specifically, after addition of uranyl, the number
of peptide events was reduced by 83.0% in the pH 6.5 solution compared
to 6.2% for the pH 7.5 solution, again suggesting that the net charge
of the uranyl-peptide complex played an important role in the disappearance
of the biomolecule events.

Figure 2 Effect of electrolyte pH on the mean residence
time of the peptide
HH14 events. The experiments were performed at +80 mV with
the (M113F)7 αHL nanopore in a series of electrolyte
solutions with different pH values and in the presence of 10 μM
peptide HH14.

Effect of Voltage Bias and Peptide Concentration on UO22+ Detection
To identify the optimum conditions
needed to achieve the maximum nanopore resolution for the detection
of UO22+, we further investigated the translocation
of peptide HH14 (without/with UO22+) in the nanopore at different voltages, ranging from +60 mV to +140
mV. Our experimental results (Figure 3) showed that, in the absence of UO22+, both the frequency and the blockage amplitude of the peptide
events increased, while the peptide event residence time decreased
as the applied potential bias increased. After addition of UO22+ to the peptide HH14 solution, the
percent reduction in the number of peptide events first increased
and then did not change significantly with an increase in the voltage.
Although the percent event reduction at +100 mV was slightly smaller
than that of +140 mV (78.9 ± 5.8% vs 79.4 ± 5.7%), +100
mV was chosen as the optimum applied potential, and this voltage was
used in the remaining experiments because the bilayer at +140 mV was
not as stable as that at +100 mV. Note that the principle for our
nanopore sensor to detect UO22+ was based on
the effect of uranyl on the frequency of the peptide HH14 events. In order to achieve highly sensitive detection of UO22+, two conditions need to be satisfied: one is
a large number of peptide events in the absence of UO22+; and the other is a large percent peptide event reduction
in the presence of UO22+.

Figure 3 Effect of the applied
potential bias on the (a) number of occurrences;
(b) blockage amplitude; and (c) residence time of the peptide HH14 events; as well as (d) percent reduction in the number of
HH14 events after addition of uranyl ions. The experiments
were performed with the (M113F)7 αHL protein nanopore
in an electrolyte solution containing 1 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris (pH
6.5) and in the presence of 10 μM peptide HH14 at
various voltages ranging from +60 mV to +140 mV. The concentration
of UO22+ used in part d was 0.5 μM.

In addition, the effect of the
peptide HH14 concentration
on the nanopore sensor resolution was examined. We found that the
number of peptide events was linearly proportional to the peptide
concentration, suggesting that the concentration of the peptide would
not affect the sensitivity of the nanopore significantly (Supporting Information, Figure S4). A concentration
of 40 μM HH14 was used in the remaining experiments
since it produced enough events for statistical data analysis within
a relatively short recording time.

Sensitivity and Selectivity
of the UO22+ Nanopore Sensor
By utilizing
the current physical condition
(i.e., pH 6.5, + 100 mV applied potential bias, and 40 μM HH14 peptide), the dose response curve for UO22+ detection was constructed by monitoring the interaction
between peptide HH14 and the nanopore in the presence of
UO22+ ions at various concentrations, ranging
from 25 nM to 500 nM. Our experimental results showed that the percent
peptide event reduction was linearly correlated with the UO22+ concentration from 25 nM to ∼200 nM (Figure 4a). It was found
that the detection limit (which is defined as the UO22+ concentration corresponding to three times the standard
deviation of blank signal) in a 10 min electrical recording was 10
nM, which is more than good enough for analyzing uranyl ion in natural
water (note that the maximum contamination level for UO22+ in drinking water defined by U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency is 130 nM).

Figure 4 Sensitivity and selectivity of the UO22+ nanopore
sensor. (a) Dose–response curve. (b) Interference study. The
experiments were performed at +100 mV with the (M113F)7 αHL protein nanopore in an electrolyte solution containing
1 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris (pH 6.5) and in the presence of 40 μM
peptide HH14. With the exception of Th4+ (5
μM), Ca2+ (500 μM), and UO22+ (0.5 μM), the concentrations of all the other metal
ions shown in part b were 20 μM each. In parts a and b, the
change (Δn) in the number of peptide HH14 events after addition of UO22+ to
the solution was calculated by using the equation: Δn = n0 – n1, where n0 represented the
number of HH14 events in the absence of uranyl, while n1 depicted the number of peptide HH14 events in the presence of UO22+.

Nine metal ions, including Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Th4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+,
were selected as
potential interfering species to examine the selectivity of the nanopore
UO22+ sensor because of their similar chemical
properties and/or abundances in water. With the exception of Th4+ (5 μM) and Ca2+ (500 μM), the concentrations
of all the other metal ions used in this investigation were 20 μM
each. Our single-channel recording experimental results suggested
that these nine metal ions did interact with peptide HH14 to form metal-peptide complexes. However, the existence of these
cationic species would not affect uranyl ion detection significantly.
As shown in Figure 4b, in the presence of Mg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, and Th4+, the number of peptide events
increased by 0.5 ± 3.1%, 9.7 ± 1.9%, 13.9 ± 3.8%, 7.0
± 1.2%, and 11.3 ± 2.6%, respectively. Similar to UO22+, the existence of Ca2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+ ions in the solution led to
a decrease in the peptide event count. However, considering that only
small event count decreases (5.1 ± 1.9%, 5.6 ± 0.9%, 2.0
± 1.1%, and 9.6 ± 3.7% for Ca2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, respectively) were obtained
in the presence of relatively large (20 to 500 μM) concentrations
of interfering metal ions, the effect is negligible (note that, in
comparison, 56.5 ± 2.4% decreases in the number of peptide events
were observed after addition of 0.5 μM uranyl ions to the solution).
Taking together, the combined results suggest that our nanopore sensor
is highly selective to UO22+. It should be noted
that histidines can bind to a variety of divalent and trivalent metal
ions, and especially display high affinity to Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+.47,49 The high selectivity of the nanopore to UO22+ based on unselective histidine–ion coordination suggests
that stoichiometry and the strength of the binding affinity between
metal ions and peptide HH14 were less likely to be the
sensing mechanism of the nanopore uranyl sensor, thus favoring our
interpretation that addition of UO22+ to the
peptide HH14 solution caused significant reduction in the
peptide event count was because the binding of uranyl to the peptide
HH14 enabled other uncomplexed peptide molecules to undergo
conformational change.

Effect of the Salt Gradient on the Sensitivity
of the UO22+ Nanopore Sensor
Use of
an asymmetric
electrolyte gradient instead of the conventional symmetric electrolyte
solution is a well-established approach to significantly increase
the event frequency for the translocation of DNA/RNA molecules through
a nanopore, thus improving the sensor sensitivity for nucleic acid
analysis.59 To examine whether this strategy
can be employed to improve the sensitivity for UO22+ detection, two experiments were performed to investigate
the translocation of peptide HH14 in the nanopore under
asymmetric electrolyte conditions. In one experiment, the cis chamber compartment contained a solution comprising
1.5 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris (pH 6.5), while the trans compartment contained a solution comprising 0.5 NaCl and 10 mM Tris
(pH 6.5). In the other experiment, we increased the salt concentration
in the cis compartment to 3 M, while maintained the
0.5 M NaCl in the trans compartment. Our experimental
results (Figure 5)
showed that, with a salt gradient solution instead of the conventional
symmetric electrolyte solution, there was indeed a significant increase
in the number of peptide translocation events. Specifically, compared
with the symmetric electrolyte solution of 1.0 M NaCl (cis)/1.0 M NaCl (trans), a salt gradient of 1.5 M NaCl
(cis)/0.5 M NaCl (trans) and a salt
gradient of 3 M NaCl (cis)/0.5 M NaCl (trans) resulted in a ∼1.75-fold and 10-fold increase in the number
of peptide events, respectively. It is not unreasonable to expect
tens- and even hundreds- fold increase in the peptide event count
if a larger salt gradient than that of 3 M NaCl (cis)/0.5 M NaCl (trans) is used. As discussed in the
voltage effect on HH14 translocation, with an increase
in the applied potential bias, the number of peptide events increased.
Under the symmetric electrolyte solution of 1.0 M NaCl (cis)/1.0 M NaCl (trans) and at +100 mV, the detection
limit of our nanopore sensor for UO22+ was 10
nM. By taking advantage of the salt gradient effect and using a larger
voltage bias (>100 mV), the detection limit for UO22+ would be greatly improved. As a noted example, with a salt
gradient of 3 M NaCl (cis)/0.5 M NaCl (trans), the detection limit of the nanopore uranyl sensor was 2 nM at
+100 mV (Supporting Information, Figure
S5). Using the same salt gradient but with the applied potential increased
to +140 mV, another 4-fold enhancement in the sensor sensitivity could
be achieved (Supporting Information, Figure
S6). This sensitivity is comparable with those of other reported highly
sensitive electrochemical, optical, and radiospectrometry methods,8,10−12 with detection limits ranging from ∼100 pM
to 50 nM.

(M113F)7 αHL nanopore in the presence of 10 μM
peptide HH14, which was added to the trans compartment of the nanopore sensing chamber. The event counts in
parts a–c were calculated based on 5 min single channel recording
trace segments.

Simulated Water Sample
Analysis
To demonstrate the
potential application of our nanopore sensor in real-world sample
analysis, three simulated uranyl ion-contaminated water samples were
created by spiking 100 nM uranyl ions into the tap water (obtained
from our life science building), lake water (from Lake Michigan),
and Ice Mountain brand bottled spring water. The simulated water samples
were analyzed by our nanopore sensor under the symmetrical buffer
conditions. Our experimental results (Figure 6) showed that the percent event reduction
values (22.7 ± 2.3%, 19.9 ± 0.2%, and 19.7 ± 1.4%)
of the three simulated water samples were similar to that (19.3 ±
1.8%) of the control sample (i.e., uranyl ion standard solution),
suggesting the matrix component in the water would not affect uranyl
ion detection significantly.

were performed
at +100 mV with the (M113F)7 αHL protein nanopore
in an electrolyte solution containing 1 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris (pH
6.5) and in the presence of 40 μM peptide HH14.

Conclusions
In
summary, a highly selective and sensitive nanopore sensor was
successfully developed to detect UO22+ ions
by using a peptide molecule as a chelating agent and taking advantage
of peptide translocation in the nanopore. Although the formation of
the UO22+-peptide complex did not produce new
types of events in the nanopore, the percent reduction in the uncomplexed
peptide translocation events could be utilized for UO22+ quantitation. The high selectivity for UO22+ of our nanopore sensor was supported by two experiments,
i.e., the interference study and simulated water analysis. Our study
showed that, in spite of their similar chemical properties and/or
large concentration in the real-world samples, metal ions such as
Cd2+, Th4+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ and other matrix components would not interfere
with UO22+ detection significantly. Our developed
nanopore sensor may find useful applications in detection of uranyl
ions in natural water for environmental monitoring or for signatures
on nuclear material production activity inside a processing facility.
