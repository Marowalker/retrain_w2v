The mechanism of
action (MOA) of the first line type-2 diabetes
drug metformin remains unclear despite its widespread usage. However,
recent evidence suggests that the mitochondrial copper (Cu)-binding
action of metformin may contribute toward the drug’s MOA. Here,
we present a novel biosensing platform for investigating the MOA of
metformin using a magnetic microbead-based agglutination assay which
has allowed us to demonstrate for the first time the interaction between
Cu and metformin at clinically relevant low micromolar concentrations
of the drug, thus suggesting a potential pathway of metformin’s
blood-glucose lowering action. In this assay, cysteine-functionalized
magnetic beadswere agglutinated in the presence of Cu due to cysteine’s
Cu-chelation property. Addition of clinically relevant doses of metformin
resulted in disaggregation of Cu-bridged bead-clusters, whereas the
effect of adding a closely related but blood-glucose neutral drug
propanediimidamide (PDI) showed completely different responses to
the clusters. The entire assay was integrated in an automated microfluidics
platform with an advanced optical imaging unit by which we investigated
these aggregation–disaggregation phenomena in a reliable, automated,
and user-friendly fashion with total assay time of 17 min requiring
a sample (metformin/PDI) volume of 30 μL. The marked difference
of Cu-binding action between the blood-glucose lowering drug metformin
and its inactive analogue PDI thus suggests that metformin’s
distinctive Cu-binding properties may be required for its effect on
glucose homeostasis. The novel automated platform demonstrating this
novel investigation thus holds the potential to be utilized for investigating
significant and sensitive molecular interactions via magnetic bead-based
agglutination assay.

==== Body
415 million people have diabetes worldwide,
and by 2040, the number
will rise to 642 million according to the latest estimates of the
International Diabetes Federation (IDF); at least 90% of these patients
have type-2 diabetes. Metformin was first used in humans as a type-2
diabetes (T2D) drug in the late 1950s1,2 and is the
first-line oral treatment for T2D. As it was discovered before the
modern day target-based drug discovery era, its mechanism of action
at the molecular level was not established before its clinical use
and still remains unclear today.1,3,4 A detailed understanding of its molecular mechanism might lead to
the development of next generation target-based drug for treating
T2D. Regarding the molecular mechanism of metformin, studies have
shown that treatment of liver cells with metformin leads to reduced
mitochondrial respiration5−8 and concomitant reduction of hepatic energy through
depletion of intracellular ATP content.9 Thus, due to lower hepatic energy, a lower amount of glucose is
produced by hepatic cells. However, the pathway through which metformin
reduces the mitochondrial respiration is not established yet and is
an area of vigorous research.

This drug has been proven to interact
with different metals10−14 and the most stable of these interactions is with the metal copper
(Cu).15,16 Recently the relationship of Cu-binding
to the clinical action of metformin has been under investigation.16−18 The studies found that metformin binds with mitochondrial Cu under
conditions where it inhibits mitochondrial respiration. Both Cu2+ and Cu1+ ions are important ions in electron
transport chain enzymes during ATP production,19−21 and inhibition
of these enzymes will reduce the content of intracellular ATP, resulting
in less glucose production due to lower hepatic energy.7 Up to now, however, the cell studies with metformin,
including those described above, have depended on high (1–2
mM or more) concentrations of drug, and therefore it is unclear if
they are related to lowering of the glucose level in blood (antihyperglycemia),
which are mediated by low micromolar plasma concentrations of the
drug in plasma. Consequently, in the current study we have developed
tools to measure metformin’s metal-binding properties at therapeutically
relevant concentrations.

Magnetic bead-based assays are being
utilized for different applications
like detection of small molecules,22,23 pathogens,24 and proteins,25,26 as well as
PCR amplification27 and drug delivery.28,29 Detection of biomarkers or molecules by agglutination-based sensing
using magnetic beads is being used for its readout simplicity.30−34 Hence, in our previous preliminary study,17 the concept of our well-studied magnetic bead-based agglutination
assay22,31,32,34,35 had been utilized for
investigating the effects of metformin on Cu ions as a step toward
understanding the mechanism of metformin. As Cu ions hardly remain
as free ions in the cells36−38 and approximately 35% of them
remain bound to cysteine residues,39,40 we prepared
Cu-l-cysteine compound/aggregates using nanosized magnetic
beads to mimic at least 35% of Cu-ligands of the cell, as these magnetic
nanobead (MNB) aggregates will model protein-bound copper ions particularly
well. Addition of different concentrations of metformin caused dissolution
of the aggregates indicating breakage of the Cu-l-cysteine
bonds. The detection of the aggregation–disaggregation phenomena
was performed by a Blu-ray-based optomagnetic system32,34 where the signal peaks were sensitive to the size and concentration
of the aggregates. Thus, the previous agglutination assay demonstrated
that metformin interacts with cysteine-bound Cu-ligand. A significant
drawback, however, is that it was insufficiently sensitive to study
this property at physiological concentrations (micromolar) of the
drug. In addition, it did not demonstrate the evidence of relationship
between the Cu-binding action and its glucose lowering property.

In this paper, we present an integrated and automated biosensing
platform with a substantial improvement in sensitivity compared to
our previous work while using microsized magnetic beads (hereafter
represented by “MB”). These improvements have allowed
us to quantify, for the first time, the effects of micromolar concentrations
of metformin on copper-bridged cysteine MB aggregates. To investigate
how well metformin’s Cu-binding action corresponds with its
glucose lowering property, we have compared the Cu-metformin interactions
with an inactive analogue of the drug propanediimidamide (PDI). Although
structurally similar to metformin, PDI does not show antihyperglycemic
behavior in cells16,17 nor does it exhibit anti-inflammatory
effects noted recently for metformin.41 The completely different behavior of PDI compared to that of metformin
suggests that metformin’s Cu-binding action may be required
for its glucose-lowering effect. The overall study has been performed
with control experiments to demonstrate the specificity of metformin’s
interaction with Cu-bridged MBs. Furthermore, the experimental setup
has been improved compared to our previous study18 by integrating an automated optical imaging unit (oCelloScope,
Philips Biocell) for automated operation of the entire study, allowing
rapid optimization of the Cu-MB clusters. The usage of microscale
beads aided visualization and the characterization of the clusters
using the imaging unit assisted in the process of the optimization
of the assay protocol. The developed sensing platform has the potential
to be an out-of-lab setting for studying molecular interactions through
MB-based agglutination assay.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Chemicals
The MBs (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin
T1, 10 mg/mL) with a surface-coating of streptavidin used in this
study were bought from Life Technologies (Thermo Scientific). EZ-Link
NHS-LC-LC Biotin was ordered from VWR (Thermo Scientific, Product
no. 21343) and l-cysteine was purchased from Merck KGaA (Germany).
50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) and 50 mM MES (pH 6.0) buffer were prepared using
Milli-Q water for washing and sample preparation. The drug vehicle
MES buffer was prepared by dissolving 0.488 g MES hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich,
product no. M8250; 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic
acid) in 45 mL Milli-Q water while the pH was adjusted with 1 M NaOH.
Cu(NO3)2 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was prepared
as 0.5 mM solution in MES buffer for performing experiments. Metformin
(1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) and PDI (propanediimidamide
dihydrochloride) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were prepared at different
concentration in MES buffer.

Sample Preparation
A solution of
10 mM biotin and a
solution of 0.6 M l-cysteine were prepared using PBS buffer
(pH 7.4). Next, the solutions of biotin and l-cysteine were
mixed with a volume ratio of 1:8.5 involving 30 min incubation at
room temperature (RT) for biotinylating the l-cysteine. Next,
10 mg/mL microsized MBs (bead diameter 1 μm) coated with streptavidin
was washed three times with PBS buffer (pH 7.4). After that, the MB
solution, biotinylated l-cysteine solution and PBS buffer
were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:3.5:5.5 followed by incubation
of 1 h with gentle shaking on a shaker at RT. Finally, the incubated
solution was washed three times with 50 mM MES buffer and resuspended
at a bead concentration of 1 mg/mL.

Biosensing Platform
In our previous study,18 we used a microfluidic
disc-based optomagnetic
unit for demonstrating the effects of different concentrations of
metformin on the clusters formed through Cu and magnetic nanobeads
(MNB). In the current study, we have integrated an optical imaging
unit34,42 onto the disc-based optomagnetic unit in
order to integrate visualization and quantification of the effects
of metformin on the microsized Cu-MB clusters (Figure 1). The setup, in addition, facilitates the
integration and automation of fluidics operation along with automated
detection in a user-friendly fashion.

Figure 1 Integrated platform for studying molecular
interactions. Integrated
experimental setup consisting of a Blu-ray based optomagnetic unit,
an automated optical imaging unit, and a pair of permanent magnets
on a centrifugal microfluidics platform. Details of the detection
units can be found in ref (43).

The current setup (Figure 1) consists of a removable
microfluidic disc, a pair of permanent
magnets mounted onto the platform for performing magnetic incubation
(MI), and an optomagnetic unit along with an optical imaging unit
for visualization and quantification of nano/microparticles. The disc
is attached to a closed-loop motor (Maxxon Motor, mod. 273756, Switzerland)
and controlled using a LabVIEW (National Instruments) based program
which facilitates automation of the assay and reproducible positioning
of the sample. The optical imaging unit can be moved along both the
horizontal and vertical axes using the instrumental software (Uniexplorer
6.0) which facilitates automated scanning at the precise positions
of the sample/disc ensuring reproducibility for multiple measurements.
The automated scanning creates multiple stacks of images using optical
sectioning principle of confocal microscopy resulting in capture of
all the MBs/MB clusters in focus within the scanning window. Using
the instrumental image processing algorithm, the software calculates
the size, i.e., the projected area of each MBs/MB aggregates, and
thus gives the mean MB aggregate size in a sample. Further details
of the scanning principle can be found in refs (34 and 42).

Experimental Procedure
The assay platform in this study
was a microfluidic disc made from two layers of poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) and bonded by a layer of pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA).
The disc (thickness 4.7 mm) contains 24 wells each of which is 4 mm
in depth and 7 mm in diameter (Figure 2a). Thus, 24 individual experiments can be performed
in a single disc, the fabrication of time of which is <10 min.
Further information on the disc fabrication is presented in the Supporting Information Section S1.

disc and assay design. (a) Schematic of the microfluidic
disc consisting of 24 wells where the agglutination assay is performed.
(b) Schematic of the agglutination assay. The MBs functionalized with
biotinylated l-cysteine forms clusters through l-cysteine-Cu bond after the addition of Cu2+ followed
by magnetic incubation, which are again disaggregated after adding
metformin followed by the second magnetic incubation. Further information
on the assay scheme is presented in the Supporting Information Section S2.

The experimental setup has three defined positions: sample-loading
position, magnetic incubation (MI) position, and scanning position
(Figure 3). First,
the microfluidic disc was mounted onto the experimental setup and
the well of the disc in which the Cu-MB sample was to be loaded was
placed at the sample-loading position. Then, a mixed solution of Cu
and streptavidin-coated MBs functionalized with biotinylated l-cysteine (volume ratio 11:1) was loaded into the particular well
of the disc (Figure 2b). After sample loading, the disc rotated following a rotation routine
set by the LabVIEW program until the sample-filled well reached the
position between the two permanent magnets (MI position) for performing
MI for 6 min with a magnetic field of 60 mT. The MI protocol consisted
of constant incubation (10 s) under the magnet for enhancing agglutination,
followed by clockwise and anticlockwise shaking of the disc with a
speed of 30 rpm for breaking unspecific binding as well as facilitating
interaction between MBs and Cu. Due to the Cu-chelation property of l-cysteine, the MBs functionalized with l-cysteine
bridge with Cu through Cu-l-cysteine bond and, thus, causes
the formation of Cu-MB clusters (Figure 2b). The complete MI protocol was run by the
rotation routine made in the LabVIEW program facilitating reproducibility
of the incubation. After the completion of MI, the disc rotated following
the rotation routine for the sample-filled well to reach the precise
position (scanning position) between the light source and camera of
the optical imaging unit in order to perform scanning of the clusters.
The solution was scanned and the captured images were analyzed by
Uniexplorer 6.0 to quantify the Cu-MB clusters. After scanning, the
sample-filled well was again positioned to the sample-loading position
using the software in order to add 30 μL of different concentration
of metformin/PDI into the Cu-MB clusters (volume ratio 1:2). After
adding the sample, the same rotation routine was initiated to perform
MI followed by scanning to quantify the clusters. The purpose of the
second MI was to further ensure the agglutination as well as facilitating
interaction between Cu-MB clusters and metformin/PDI while breaking
the nonspecific bindings. The total assay time including incubation
and scanning was approximately 17 min.

Results and Discussion
Interaction
of Metformin and PDI with Copper
Our previous
study using MNBs and the optomagnetic unit of the experimental setup18 showed that Cu-MNB clusters formed after addition
of Cu into the MNB solution, and as millimolar concentrations of metformin
were added, the Cu-MNB clusters were disaggregated accordingly.

In our current study, we were able to test millimolar and micromolar
doses of metformin due to the optimization of the assay protocol and
the integration of the imaging unit. In the first experiment, we investigated
the effect of higher doses (0.5–50 mM) of metformin on Cu-MB
disaggregation (Figure 4). We found that at each concentration tested, metformin disaggregated
the beads.

the Cu-MB clusters. (a) Images captured by the optical imaging unit

(calculated by Uniexplorer 6.0) vs different MB samples. Error bars

Scale bar: 50 μm. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by one way ANOVA test
compared to Cu2+ sample.

The control/blank sample containing only MBs suspended in
MES buffer
shows no MB clusters (Figure 4). Addition of Cu2+ into the control sample followed
by first MI forms the Cu-MB clusters. This aggregation phenomena indicates
that addition of Cu2+ along with MI causes the l-cysteine-functionalized MBs to bind to Cu2+ through the
formation of Cu-l-cysteine bond. Then, the addition of different
concentrations of metformin into the Cu2+ sample followed
by second MI causes the breakage of the clusters. As the MBs were
aggregated based on the Cu-l-cysteine bond, this disaggregation
phenomena indicates that metformin has caused the breakage of Cu-l-cysteine bond.

Next, we investigated the effect of the
same concentrations of
PDI on the Cu-MB clusters, to compare with that of metformin (Figure 5). We found that
addition of PDI did not reduce the Cu-MB clusters at lower concentrations
and from 10 mM onward, PDI increased the size of the clusters. These
results demonstrate that PDI does not break the Cu-l-cysteine
bond like metformin. Although they are structurally similar to metformin,
malonamides like PDI are not antihyperglycemic,44 and thus, these results are consistent there being a link
between the metformin’s Cu-binding action and its antihyperglycemic
properties.

clusters. (a) Images captured by the optical imaging unit of different

Control Experiments
We performed control experiments
in order to validate that we had measured true effects of metformin
and PDI and their interaction with copper ions. In order to validate
that it is not MI but Cu which forms the aggregates, a sample containing
MES (copper vehicle) and functionalized MBs with a volume ratio of
11:1 (similar ratio to the Cu-MB sample) was loaded into the disc
followed by first MI which showed no clusters (Figure 6a). Then, MES buffer alone was further added
to this solution followed by second MI to mimic the addition of metformin/PDI
into Cu-MB solution. Even after the second MI, no significant clusters
were formed, which shows that it is Cu and not MI which causes the
larger clusters to form (Figure 6a,b).

drug/metal
interactions. (a) Images captured by the optical imaging unit showing
a comparison of the MB aggregate size between the first and second
MI of the control sample after adding 30 μL of buffer. (b) Corresponding

(calculated by Uniexplorer 6.0) vs the Cu2+ samples. Error
bars indicate the standard deviation obtained from triplicate measurements.
Scale bar: 50 μm.

To validate the effect of metformin/PDI on Cu-MB clusters,
we added
30 μL of MES (drug vehicle) in the Cu-MB clusters followed by
second MI which showed no significant change in cluster size (Figure 6c,d). This vehicle
control strongly indicates that the effects of metformin and PDI are
true drug-dependent effects. Together, these results indicate that
Cu is required to form the large-scale aggregates and that metformin
alone disaggregates these beads.

Assay Optimization to Detect
Metformin/Copper Interaction at
Physiological Drug Concentrations
The peak plasma concentration
of metformin is in the region of 25–50 μM,45 and consequently we were interested in investigating
the metformin/Cu interactions at these lower concentrations. In order
to optimize the assay sensitivity to lower concentrations of metformin,
we focused on the volume ratio of biotin and l-cysteine during
the sample preparation step because the biotinylated l-cysteine
is a significant component of this assay as it functions as a linker
between Cu and streptavidin-coated MBs to enable aggregation. The
initial volume ratio of biotin and l-cysteine was 1:8.5 by
which the millimolar effects of metformin have been demonstrated above.
At this volume ratio, we noted the presence of free MBs as well as
heterogeneous MB clusters of smaller and larger size (Figure 7a) indicating that many of
MBs were not sufficiently functionalized with l-cysteine,
due to insufficient biotinylation of l-cysteine. Probably
because of this heterogeneity, we were unable to reliably detect effects
of low concentrations of metformin on these MB aggregates. To improve
sensitivity, we hypothesized that there might be an optimal ratio
of biotin:l-cysteine, where most of the MBs would be homogeneously
functionalized with biotinylated l-cysteine, leading to the
formation of Cu-MB clusters of increased homogeneity and potentially
improving assay sensitivity. Optimizing MB functionalization with l-cysteine through maximizing the biotinylation of l-cysteine would increase the probability of MBs agglutinating more
specifically through Cu bridges, potentially increasing the sensitivity
of the assay to metformin-induced disaggregation. We varied the biotin:l-cysteine ratio in two stock solutions from 1:8.5 (highC sample)
to 1:4.5 (lowC sample) and 1:2.5 (very lowC sample) by increasing
the volume of biotin. The amount of l-cysteine was kept constant
as reducing cysteine further below would ultimately result in a failure
of aggregates to form. We compared side by side the Cu-MB clusters
formed from MB samples with these three different biotin and l-cysteine ratios (Figure 7a) and found indeed that the lowC ratio formed aggregates
that were much more homogeneous in size and densely packed than in
the highC sample.

Figure 7 High sensitivity assay measures metformin/Cu interaction
at physiological
concentrations of the drug. (a) Images captured by the optical imaging
unit showing a comparison of Cu-MB clusters of the samples with different
biotin-l-cysteine ratios. (b) Effect of low concentrations
of metformin (Metf) on Cu-MB clusters using the lowC sample. Images

metformin at different concentrations at micromolar range into the
Cu-MB clusters. (c) Mean MB aggregate size (calculated by Uniexplorer
6.0) vs different MB samples. The blue line indicates the result of
the control experiment which shows that addition of Cu2+ into control/blank sample creates Cu-MB clusters followed by addition
of MES showing no significant change. Error bars indicate the standard
deviation obtained from triplicate measurements. Scale bar: 50 μm.
*P < 0.05 by one way ANOVA test compared to MES+Cu2+ sample.

Compared to both of these
samples, the very low C sample, which
was prepared by adding a much higher volume of biotin, resulted in
Cu-MB clusters much smaller both in size and in amount, confirming
that saturation with biotin eventually blocks aggregate formation,
likely because the excess amount of free biotin saturated the binding
sites of streptavidin on the MBs.

We used the improved formulation
of the lowC sample to study the
effects of metformin at low concentrations (Figure 7b,c). As before, the addition of Cu2+ into the MB solution followed by MI resulted in clusters. Further
addition of 25 μM or 50 μM metformin followed by second
MI causes the breakage of the clusters indicating that metformin does
interact with Cu2+ from the Cu-l-cysteine bond,
even at micromolar concentrations. To validate this experiment, MES
buffer (instead of metformin) was added to Cu-MB solution followed
by MI, which showed again no significant change to the clusters.

We thus found that the formulation of the lowC sample was a crucial
development to enable visualizing the effect of metformin in the micromolar
range. In future work, we will continue to pursue further possibilities
for optimization in order to make the assay more sensitive and robust.

Conclusion and Future Work
We have developed an improved
experimental setup to study molecular
interactions using magnetic bead-based agglutination assay. Using
this equipment along with the optimized assay, we demonstrate for
the first time that metformin interacts with copper ions at physiologically
significant concentrations of the drug. Furthermore, our experiments
comparing the effects of metformin and PDI strongly suggest that metformin’s
Cu-binding property may be linked to its therapeutic drug action.
These results create a platform for future work to further investigate
the effects of metformin directly in blood cells and hepatic cells
at μM concentrations by adaptation of the magnetic bead-based
agglutination assay we have developed. However, utilization of magnetic
bead-based agglutination assay in raw biological samples (e.g., plasma
or cells) is challenging as endogenous interferents can form unspecific
magnetic bead clusters decreasing the specificity and sensitivity
of the assay. Therefore, in our next study with raw biological samples,
we will integrate the biotin-l-cysteine conjugation protocol
with our previously presented30 antifouling
surface architecture development through the formation of a layer
of blocking proteins on the bead surface in order to prevent nonspecific
aggregate formation under the influence of the biological samples.
As serum albumin is well-known to minimize protein aggregation;46 likewise in a previous study,31 the surface of the MBs first would be passivated with a
monolayer of human serum albumin (HSA) for preventing the formation
of undesired protein corona in plasma samples. The HSA monolayer on
the MB surface would be attached to l-cysteine through biotinylated
biorthogonal click conjugation (e.g., Cu-free click chemistry) forming
a multilayered surface structure over MB surface for such surface
structures previously demonstrated dramatic increase of assay sensitivity
as well as facilitation of specific cross-linking of the affinity
probes in biological fluids.31,47 The entire assay can
be integrated in the microfluidic disc with additional microfluidic
structures for on-disc plasma extraction from whole blood sample.
For cellular studies, a fluorescence probe can be added to the MBs
with multilayered surface architecture followed by microinjecting
the conjugate in hepatic (e.g., H4IIE) cells. Thus, the presence of
cellular Cu-l-cysteine is expected to form Cu-bridged MB
clusters inside the cells while quenching the fluorescence. Adding
metformin to the cell medium and its uptake into the cell will be
expected to cause disintegration of the aggregates while restoring
the fluorescence. Hence, the extension of this study in the future
can be performed in raw biological samples by overcoming the potential
challenges of biological interferences and thus adding further validation
to this current study of metformin’s Cu-binding action at cellular
concentrations. In conclusion, the developed biosensing platform demonstrating
automation, low sample-to-answer time, along with a novel application,
thus paves the way for investigating further significant molecular
interactions using the simple readout concept of agglutination assay
in a reliable and user-friendly fashion.
