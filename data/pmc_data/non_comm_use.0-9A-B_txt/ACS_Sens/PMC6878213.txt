Quantitative applications of surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) often rely on surface partition layers grafted to SERS substrates
to collect and trap-solvated analytes that would not otherwise adsorb
onto metals. Such binding layers drastically broaden the scope of
analytes that can be probed. However, excess binding sites introduced
by this partition layer also trap analytes outside the plasmonic “hotspots”.
We show that by eliminating these binding sites, limits of detection
(LODs) can effectively be lowered by more than an order of magnitude.
We highlight the effectiveness of this approach by demonstrating quantitative
detection of controlled drugs down to subnanomolar concentrations
in aqueous media. Such LODs are low enough to screen, for example,
urine at clinically relevant levels. These findings provide unique
insights into the binding behavior of analytes, which are essential
when designing high-performance SERS substrates.

==== Body
Tremendous
efforts have been
made in the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
substrates, often utilizing colloidal self-assembly or complex patterning
of metal surfaces, with many variants that showcase million-fold SERS
enhancements factors (EFs).1−5 However, because EFs scale as |E|4,
spatial inhomogeneities in field enhancement |E(x,y)| result in highly varying Raman intensities
across such high-performance substrates.6 As a consequence, the majority of the measured SERS spectra are
generated by only a small fraction of the molecules, situated in highly
localized optically active sites (hotspots)1,7−9 (Figure S1). This means
that the adsorption location of molecules on SERS substrates greatly
affects the strength of their SERS signals. However, because SERS
is capable of single-molecule sensing,7 as proposed by Le Ru et al., a highly optimized SERS substrate should
be able to detect every single molecule at low analyte concentrations.9 Local variations can be effectively mitigated
by collecting signals over a large number of hotspots, thus averaging
SERS intensities for a given analyte concentration.10−12 Averaging,
however, results in a large fraction of analyte molecules not contributing
significantly to the collected SERS spectra. This effect becomes increasingly
important at low analyte concentrations when the total number of analyte
molecules approaches the (large) number of binding sites available
outside the hotspot, resulting in fewer analyte molecules reaching
the high-performance hotspots.13,14 Here, this is termed
“analyte theft”.

These issues are often ignored
when testing novel SERS substrates.
Typically, an “optimized” sample is created by coating
the substrates with a dense layer of molecules with strong (typically
thiol) binding groups with the sole purpose of determining an idealized
EF. However, in practice, analytes do not have such strong metal-binding
groups, for instance, biomarkers,15 controlled
substances,16 or other polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons of interest.17,18 Therefore, in addition
to reproducible high field enhancements, an ideal SERS substrate should
have at least two more features. First, the SERS substrate should
have either a specific or ubiquitous affinity to the analyte. A number
of SERS substrates have already been presented that employ supramolecular
chemistry to capture conventionally nonbinding analytes. Such substrates
typically employ biofunctionalization,19,20 amphiphilic15 or hydrophobic21 partition
layers, or amphiphilic cage constructions such as cyclodextrins22−24 or cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s).12,25−27 Second, the SERS substrate should preferably only
bind analytes near the hotspot to minimize analyte theft. The majority
of the proposed substrates, however, are fully coated by these receptive
partition layers resulting in the number of binding sites approaching
or exceeding the total number of analyte molecules available in the
system when sensing at submicromolar concentrations (see Supporting Information, Section 2 e.g., calculation).
Although several techniques have been introduced to achieve hotspot-selective
adsorption,9,28−30 no study has
focused on how this affects the quantitative sensing of real analytes.

Here, we present a highly reproducible self-assembled SERS substrate
consisting of gold nanoparticles and CB[n]s as rigid
molecular linkers, with a general amphiphilic affinity to analytes.
We study quantitatively the effect of eliminating indiscriminant binding
on the detection of analytes at submicromolar concentrations. The
rigid CB molecular spacer provides precise control over the interparticle
spacing in AuNP aggregates,26 and their
hydrophobic nature combined with surface-bound charged citrate molecules
provides an environment rich in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites.
In addition, locally replacing the bounding aqueous phase with a neighboring
metal nanoparticle surface renders the local chemical environment
significantly different from that of a ligand-coated nanoparticle
surface. We show that these properties combine to allow for interstitial
incorporation of analytes (i.e., outside the CB molecular cavity but
within the plasmonic hotspot). We quantitatively demonstrate that
by eliminating the indiscriminant binding (analyte theft), this localized
interstitial incorporation allows detection of analytes down to subnanomolar
concentrations in water. Our results show that this interstitial binding
principle can be employed to detect a wide range of analytes as binding
does not depend on the analyte’s affinity to the metal, but
rather on its preference for the amphiphilic interactions presented
within the hotspot.

Results and Discussion
SERS Substrate Formation
To demonstrate interstitial
incorporation of analytes and show the benefits of preventing indiscriminate
binding, plasmonic substrates consisting of self-assembled AuNPs with
a range of molecular spacers of CB[n] were compared,
where n is 5, 6, 7, or 8.25 Adding CB[n] to a dispersion of citrate-stabilized
AuNPs induces self-assembly, forming aggregates as the particles stick
together via the CB[n] which act as rigid 0.9 nm
molecular spacers (Figure 1a).26,31 This aggregation takes about
10 min during which a gradual color change from red to blue-gray is
observed (inset Figure 1a,b). The resulting aggregates consist of a collection of plasmonic
hotspots with reproducible localized field enhancements as a result
of the rigid sub-nm separations.26,32

at 532 nm (top), 633 nm (middle), and 785 nm (bottom) in counts per
second per milliWatt (cts·s–1·mW–1).

SERS Substrate Characterization
Absorbance spectra
during aggregation (Figure 1b) show a drop in the single nanoparticle mode (at 534 nm)
combined with a rise of the dimer mode (at 690 nm) and chain modes
(up to 1000 nm). The red-shifted chain modes visible at the culmination
of aggregation result from the coupling together of the individual
hotspot modes, feasible only because of the exact reproducibility
of the gap spacing. After 10 min, the aggregation is seen to terminate
with a predominant scattering mode around 900 nm.26,31,33 Scanning electron micrographs
of the aggregates (Figure 1c) show a fractal-like structure, with chain lengths between
two and seven nanoparticles characteristic for this self-assembly
process.26,32 Modeling a chain of six 60 nm AuNPs with
0.9 nm spacings using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations
matches the dominant scattering mode at 900 nm observed in the absorbance
experiments (black dashed line, Figure 1b). Plotting the field enhancements of the modeled
structure clearly shows that the highest enhancements are localized
within the gaps between the nanoparticles.34,35 This simplified linear chain is expected to have comparable field
enhancements to our aggregates because bends in the chains are found
to have limited effects on the resonant localization properties.32 The simulated structure shows field enhancements
up to |E/E0| = 250 at
900 nm, which implies EFs around 109 when exciting and
collecting at resonance.6 The broad absorbance
spectra in Figure 1b suggest that relatively high EFs are expected over a wide range
of wavelengths, from 700 to 1000 nm, though a local maximum is also
observed at 534 nm for transverse modes of the chains.

Comparing
three different excitation wavelengths (Figure 1d) shows that at 532 nm (transverse mode),
no clear SERS signals are observed. For both 633 and 785 nm excitations,
the clear peaks seen around 830 cm–1 are characteristic
for CB[n]. The highest emission (in counts per second
per milliWatt: cts·s–1·mW–1) is observed for 785 nm excitation, as expected from the absorbance
spectra in Figure 1b. Using a 5× microscope objective ensures a large volume of
∼107 hotspots are simultaneously probed in solution,
providing the averaging as noted above, which is required for reproducible
and quantitative SERS spectra.

Analyte Binding Mechanisms
The amphiphilic nature of
CB[n] allows the larger variants (n = 7 and 8) to sequester a range of molecules in their hydrophobic
cavity, binding them to the substrate.11,12,25 However, we show here that at very small analyte
concentrations, binding sites outside the hotspots, arising from excess
CB[7,8] molecules in solution and attached to the substrate, scavenge
analytes away from the plasmonic hotspots, thus effectively lowering
the Raman scattering intensity for a given concentration (Figure 2a, box).

Figure 2 Analyte incorporation
mechanisms in plasmonic hotspots. (a) Methyl
viologen (MV2+) has a strong binding affinity toward CB[7],
binding outside the plasmonic hotspots also, effectively lowering
the probed MV2+ concentration (counter ions have been omitted
for clarity). (b) CB[5] is too small to bind MV2+ inside,
but the constricted hotspot volume (orange shaded) binds analytes
interstitially. (c) (Top) SERS spectra for MV2+ using CB[5]

(ii) MV2+ resulting in a clear new peak at 1650 cm–1, and subsequently (iii) CB[7], lowering the intensity
of the peak at 1650 cm–1 as CB[7] scavenges analytes
away from the hotspot.

The AuNP metal surfaces
are coated with a layer of hydrophobic
CB[n] molecules (Figure 3), and water, as well as a mixed coating
of trisodium citrate (hydrophilic) and citric acid (hydrophilic) used
for colloidal charge stabilization. Bringing two such Au surfaces
close together around the hotspot creates a local environment particularly
dense in local molecular interactions that no longer resemble a continuous
solid–liquid interface. This change in the environment seems
to enhance binding of amphiphilic analytes from the aqueous phase
because of the close proximity of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
sites (Figure 2b).
Such host–guest type of association is similar to that of the
CB[7] system (Figure 2a) but instead occurs through interstitial incorporation. When using
the smaller CB[5] molecule, size selection prevents the binding of
anything larger than methane or methanol inside the small CB volume.25,36 This prevents analytes from adsorbing at sites outside the hotspot
leaving only the interstitial incorporation mechanism to capture analytes
(Figure 2b).

Figure 3 Calculated

for both CB[5] and citrate showing a strong negative potential for
citrate and neutral/positive potential for CB[5].

Methyl viologen (MV2+) is an amphiphilic analyte too
large to fit in CB[5] but with a large affinity to CB[7]. When added
to AuNPs aggregated using CB[5] spacers, a set of distinct MV2+ peaks appears between 1200 and 1300 cm–1 and at 1650 cm–1, evident from nanomolar
concentrations upward, demonstrating interstitial incorporation (Figure 2b, top). This is
in line with earlier observations for ethanol/methanol sensing using
CB[5].36 PCA is used to isolate the spectral
changes and identify their corresponding chemical moieties (Figure 2c, bottom). PCA allows
correlated variables (in this case, spectral features) to be identified
and through orthogonal transformations to be combined into uncorrelated
linear combinations of spectra. These transformed combinations are
called principal components (here, referred to as “comp”).
The PCA loading plot for comp I closely matches the characteristic
CB[5] spectrum in Figure 1d, and comp II can be closely matched to the powder Raman
spectrum of MV2+ (bottom trace in Figure 2c). The obtained comp II for CB[5] (green
trace) and CB[7] (red trace) are nearly identical, eliminating possible
additional differences between the binding mechanisms that could contribute
to the EF but which would change the spectral shape or intensity ratios
such as analyte orientation or binding into the metal surface (bottom Figure 2c comp II).37

Multiplying the obtained PCA score for
comp II with the absolute
counts integrated over the full spectral range of the loading plot
for comp II provides a measure of the change in the SERS spectra upon
MV2+ addition in cts·s–1·mW–1 (Figure 2d). Comparing the SERS changes between aggregates formed with
CB[5] and CB[7] clearly shows stronger spectral peaks for CB[5]. At
submicromolar concentrations, changes are visible only for the CB[5]
aggregates, showing an improvement in the limit of detection (LOD)
by more than an order of magnitude in spite of the smaller spacer’s
inability to directly bind MV2+. To demonstrate this scavenging
effect more clearly, MV2+ was added to CB[5]-AuNP aggregates,
giving a clear set of SERS peaks (Figure 2e, lower trace), and subsequently CB[7] was
added resulting in a reduction of the MV2+ peaks (Figure 2e, upper trace).
Both experiments confirm that the excess binding sites introduced
by CB[7] scavenge analytes away from the hotspots.

Drug Detection
We studied this system in more detail
by varying both the CB[n] spacer size and the chemical
nature of the analyte molecule. To demonstrate that this improvement
of LOD is not unique to MV2+ and to showcase the robustness
of this technique, a set of controlled substances were explored. The
chosen substances were selected for their interest in healthcare and
substance control, and would typically require at least nanomolar
sensitivities to accurately determine their concentrations in urine
after consumption.38 Here, we use Δ9-THC, the principal psychoactive constituent in cannabis
(chemical structure shown in Figure 5a), and several synthetic analogues with different
chemical structures designed to induce similar psychotropic effects.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using umbrella
sampling to model the THC molecule binding into the cavity of the
CB[n] spacers (Figure 4a). Free energy profiles along the association coordinate
were generated as a function of the center-of-mass (COM) distance
for each THC–CB[n] complex (Figure 4b). This shows that both CB[7]
and CB[8] have a highly favorable binding to THC, whereas the binding
free energy gain is nearly halved for CB[6] and almost nonexistent
for CB[5], showing clearly the effect of reducing the spacer cavity
size on analyte binding. We calculate the binding energy for each
system from more accurate density functional theory (DFT) calculations
(see Methods) to model the interacting complexes,
showing that weaker binding affinities are indeed predicted as the
size of the spacer is reduced (Figure 5a).

dip of −9 and −11 kcal mol–1 for THC–CB[7] and THC–CB[8] complexes, respectively,
decreased binding affinity for CB[6], and no favorable binding free
energy for CB[5].

comp II: THC and (bottom) comp III: unassigned molecular interactions.
(c) PCA scores for each of the four complexes show an increase in
scores (proportional to the signal strength) with decrease in the
CB[n] spacer size (arrow).

To experimentally probe how these differences in binding affect
analyte detection, a concentration series of THC, diluted in methanol,
was measured using SERS substrates prepared with each of the different
CB[n] spacers (Figure 5a,b). A significantly higher analyte component II coefficient
for the loading plots was found when using the smaller CB[5] and CB[6]
compared to their larger homologues CB[7] and CB[8] with a more rapid
increase and higher maximum counts with the same concentration for
the smaller spacers. In component III, a range of peaks appear around
1600 cm–1, which we tentatively assign to hydrogen-bonding
related interactions (from trisodium citrate, methanol, water, or
THC), indicative of analyte binding within the complex environment.36 When comparing the spectral changes for each
of the spacers, CB[7] and CB[8] show analyte detection at submicromolar
concentrations, but a clear enhancement of spectral changes and lower
LOD is observed for CB[5] and CB[6] (Figure 5c), in line with the earlier observations
(Figure 2c). This again
shows that the analyte is selectively incorporated within the substrate
hotspots independent of direct binding within the spacer and that
eliminating excess binding improves the detectivity of the THC molecule.

Because the observed interstitial binding is independent of the
CB[n] spacer cavity at low concentrations, these
SERS substrates allow for more ubiquitous analyte incorporation. This
makes such substrates a powerful new tool when probing for a range
of different analytes such as the many synthetic analogues of THC
that have appeared in consumer markets in recent years.39−42 To demonstrate that these substrates can indeed incorporate different
compounds, a concentration series of three synthetic analogues of
THC are also measured (Figure 6a). When comparing the loading plots for each of the compounds,
other than the characteristic CB[n] peak at 830 cm–1 and varying peaks between 1550 and 1700 cm–1, each compound provides a clearly distinct spectrum acting as a
unique fingerprint identifier (Figure 6b). The demonstrated nonspecificity to analytes makes
this method of sensing highly suitable for routine screening of such
compounds. The technique readily copes with rapid changes in chemical
structures, required when probing for such compounds.42 Comparing the PCA results, it is clear that all compounds
can be readily detected at nanomolar concentrations, which is well
below typical clinical levels (see Figure 6c).38,42,43 To obtain an estimate of the LOD for each compound, a Hill–Langmuir
isotherm was fitted to the PCA scores (see Supporting Information, Sections 4–6 for details) using  where A is the saturation
value, Kd is the dissociation coefficient,
[analyte] is the analyte concentration, and N is
the Hill coefficient. The residuals on these fits from the noise in
the SERS spectra allow estimation of the concentration at which the
highest peak would be discernible from the noise (Supporting Information, Section 6). This provides an insight
into the LOD for each analyte. Although, in practice, LODs are expected
at slightly higher concentrations because several peaks need to clear
the noise threshold (>0.03 cts·mW–1·s–1) for a spectrum to be distinct and recognizable (Table 1).

plasmonic hotspots. (a) Four different analytes:
THC (2) and three synthetic analogues (3), (4), and (5). (b) PCA loading plots
showing distinct spectra for each compound, with little difference
whether CB[5] or CB[6] is used. (c) PCA scores and Langmuir isotherm
fits for each of the components show LODs clearly in the nanomolar
regime with compounds (2–4) showing LODs near
or below 1 nanomolar concentration.

(5) 5F-AKB48	26.0(±0.03)	
To confirm these estimated
LODs are truly realistic, spectral changes
at analyte concentrations near the LOD are compared to the noise threshold
(see Supporting Information, Section 6
for details). The high reproducibility of the SERS spectra allows
for the reference to be reliably subtracted from the raw data revealing
spectral changes arising with the addition of the analyte and its
carrier solvent, as shown for analyte (2:THC) in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Validation of the LOD
for analyte (2). (a) SERS spectra of CB[5]:AuNP
aggregates with four different analyte concentrations (2.5, 0.5, 0.1,
and 0.02 nM). The zoomed-in region of interest showing small spectral
changes. (c) SERS spectra with the background subtracted, showing
peaks for analyte (2) exceeding the noise threshold for
2.5 and 0.5 nM concentrations (arrows).

At 2.5 and 0.5 nM, the analyte peaks are still recognizable and
exceed the noise threshold (Figure 7c), while at 0.1 nM, the signal has dropped into the
noise. This is in good agreement with the derived LOD of 0.34 nM,
showing that using the Hill–Langmuir fit with PCA scores is
a suitable technique to approximate LODs. Such low LODs are typically
the preserve of immunoassay SERS substrates tailored to detect a specific
analyte.20 Interestingly, a higher LOD
is observed for compound (5) and is paired with a higher
Hill coefficient (see Supporting Information, Table S2), indicating a stronger competitive binding occurs for
this analyte. Exploring in detail what determines this difference
in the LOD will further push understanding of the complex interactions
present in self-assembled plasmonic nanogaps and is the subject of
the ongoing research. However, it is clear that the chemical environment
of plasmonic gaps can be exploited for interstitial analyte incorporation
and that eliminating excess binding sites has a drastic effect on
improving the LODs. On this basis, new strategies can be developed
for existing substrates to remove or passivate excess binding. Such
strategies can, for example, involve multiple washing steps to remove
excess binding sites or adding ions or large molecules to block these
sites, leaving only hotspots exposed.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated an interstitial analyte incorporation mechanism
in self-assembled colloidal SERS substrates and used it to show the
effects of analyte “theft” by indiscriminate binding
on the LOD. We have shown that for THC and all three tested synthetic
analogues, weaker binding of molecular spacers results in higher SERS
signals and lower LODs, reaching subnanomolar concentrations. These
findings highlight that for SERS-based detection of analytes, at very
low concentrations, indiscriminate binding of target molecules should
be eliminated where possible, as this has a detrimental effect on
signal strengths and when successful can increase the LOD by more
than an order of magnitude.

Methods
Concentration
Series
THC (1 mg/mL in methanol) and
methyl viologen dichloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, the
synthetic analogues 3–5 were provided by Tic Tac
Communications, and all chemicals were used as received. The different
analyte concentrations were prepared by volumetric dilution of analytes
using either water (for MV2+) or methanol (laboratory reagent
grade, Fisher Scientific) as the solvent. Vials containing the diluted
analyte concentrations were sealed and used within 1 h of preparation
to minimize effects of solvent evaporation.

Formation of SERS Substrates
60 nm AuNP suspensions
were purchased from BBI Solutions (citrate capped, optical density
OD1) and stored at 7 °C. Prior to use, the AuNP suspension was
allowed to reach room temperature. CB[n] molecular
spacers were synthesized and separated according to the procedure
described in ref (25). To induce self-assembly, 7 μL of a 1 mM solution of CB[n] was added to the bottom of a black polystyrene 96-well
plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). AuNP suspension (300 μL) was
added and allowed to aggregate for 10 min.

Analyte Detection
The CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], and CB[8]
concentration series were measured using the same stock solutions,
freshly prepared from a 1 mg/mL solution in methanol using volumetric
dilution with a suitable carrier solvent (methanol for the synthetic
cannabinoids and water for methyl viologen). Specifically, 1 mL
of analyte (2) at 1 mg/mL in MeOH was added to an
empty 5 mL volumetric flask and filled to the appropriate volume
using MeOH. The new concentration in the flask (now, 0.2 mg/mL) was
stored in a sealed container and 1 mL was drawn for the next dilution
step. For SERS measurements, 20 μL of analyte solution was added
to the aggregated suspension, mixed, and allowed to homogenize for
2 more minutes. SERS spectra were recorded on a commercial Renishaw
Raman setup using either a 532, a 633, or a 785 nm laser, with typical
quantitative measurements taken using a 785 nm laser at 119 mW, by
combining 3 iterations with 10 s integration time. For focusing and
collection, a 5 × 0.15 NA Olympus objective was used giving an
estimated spot size of 0.4 mm3. To demonstrate reproducibility,
typical measurements were performed at least in threefold, meaning
three unique samples were created by combining CB[n] and AuNPs and adding the desired analyte concentration from a stock
solution.

Principal Component Analysis
Prior to PCA, a linear
background was subtracted from each of the spectra using the lowest
point in the spectra. The WaveMetrics Igor implementation of PCA was
used to calculate the loading plots and scores for each of the components.
The PCA results were obtained as described in ref (36).

FDTD Simulations
FDTD simulations were performed using
Lumerical FDTD Solutions v8.12. The AuNP chains were modeled as linear
assemblies of core–shell spheres with a core diameter of 60
nm of Au and a dielectric shell of 0.9 nm with a refractive index
of 1.45. The dielectric function of gold was taken from Johnson and
Christy. The structure was illuminated with a broadband plane wave
(TFSF source) polarized along the chain length. The scattering and
near-field intensities were obtained from the inbuilt cross-section
and near-field monitors. The narrow gaps of the plasmonic chains were
simulated by using multiple meshing of the narrow gaps and nanoparticles.
The calculations were converged at 0.3 nm meshing for the gaps along
the dimer axis of the NPs and with dx = dy = dz = 1 nm meshing throughout the NP
volume. Care was taken to ensure there were no staircasing artifacts
in defining the curved surface of nanoparticles. We have previously
shown the importance of meshing in the accurate determination of field
volumes and their contribution to near fields.44

DFT Calculations
The gas phase and
subsequent continuum
solvent geometry optimizations of the complexes (THC@CB[n], n = 5–8), host (CB[n], n = 5–8), and guest (THC) molecules were performed
using the hybrid B3LYP exchange–correlation functional in combination
with the split-valence double-zeta polarized basis set, 6-31G* and
including the Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction with Becke–Johnson
damping.45 Continuum solvent geometry optimizations
were performed using the SMD continuum models parametrized for water.
The gas phase potential energies of the THC@CB[n], n = 5–8 complexes were corrected for the basis set
superposition error, which is significant because of the incompleteness
of the present basis set. For the accurate description of the low
frequency modes, an ultrafine DFT integration grid was used. No symmetry
restrictions were imposed during the geometry optimization procedure.
Frequency calculations with the SMD solvent model46 were performed at the same level of theory to obtain the
association Gibbs free energies, G0RRHO/QH(l) and enthalpies, H0RRHO(l) in the rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator (RRHO) and quasi-harmonic
(mixture of RRHO and free rotor vibrational entropies along with the
translational entropy correction based on the free space accessible
to the solute)47,48 (QH) approximation and including
zero-point vibrational energy at 298 K and 1 atm. Final continuum
solvent solution phase association Gibbs free energies (ΔGbindRRHO/QH) and enthalpies (ΔHbindRRHO/QH) were calculated by adding the
counterpoise correction, δECP(g)    where Δ represents that the supramolecular
approach ΔX = X(complex) – X(host) – X(guest) has been used.
The association free energies are summarized in Table S1. All standard DFT calculations were performed by
using the Gaussian 0949 ab initio program
package.

Free Energy Profiles of Association
MD simulations
were performed with the NAMD 2.950 program
using the CHARMM3651 force field. The THC@CB[n], n = 5–8 complexes were solvated
in a pre-equilibrated TIP3P cubic water box of edge 65 Å. The
resulting systems contain 8689, 8685, 8669, and 8660 H2O molecules for n = 5, 6, 7, and 8, CB[n] analogues, respectively. Our MD protocol consisted of: (1) energy
minimization over 15 000 steps; (2) equilibration over 1 ns
in the NPT ensemble (p = 1.01325
bar and T = 303.15 K) with the RMSD of heavy atoms
in CB[n], n = 5–8 and THC
constrained to their initial position using a force constant of 1
kcal/(mol·Å2); (3) 2 ns run in the NPT ensemble; (4) US production runs of 5 ns in the NPT ensemble for each umbrella window with a spring constant of 100
kcal/(mol·Å2). Temperature and pressure were
held constant at 303.15 K and 1 atm, respectively. A constant temperature
was set by a Langevin thermostat with a damping coefficient of 1 ps–1. All the bonds and angles involving hydrogen atoms
were constrained by the SHAKE52 algorithm.
We used the particle mesh Ewald method53 for the long-range electrostatics in combination with a 12 Å
cutoff for the evaluation of the nonbonded interactions. Trajectories
were run with a time step of 2 fs and the collective variable employed
in US was printed out in each step and used for the analysis. The
umbrella bias for the host–guest association process was defined
as the distance between COM of CB[n], n = 5–8 and the COM of the THC ligand. We used the dynamic
histogram analysis method54 to compute
the free energy profiles along the association coordinate.
