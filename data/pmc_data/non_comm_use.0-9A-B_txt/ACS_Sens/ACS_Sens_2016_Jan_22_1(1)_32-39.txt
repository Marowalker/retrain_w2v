Chelatable, or mobile, forms of zinc
play critical signaling roles
in numerous biological processes. Elucidating the action of mobile
Zn(II) in complex biological environments requires sensitive tools
for visualizing, tracking, and manipulating Zn(II) ions. A large toolbox
of synthetic photoinduced electron transfer (PET)-based fluorescent
Zn(II) sensors are available, but the applicability of many of these
probes is limited by poor zinc sensitivity and low dynamic ranges
owing to proton interference. We present here a general approach for
acetylating PET-based probes containing a variety of fluorophores
and zinc-binding units. The new sensors provide substantially improved
zinc sensitivity and allow for incubation of live cells and tissue
slices with nM probe concentrations, a significant improvement compared
to the μM concentrations that are typically required for a measurable
fluorescence signal. Acetylation effectively reduces or completely
quenches background fluorescence in the metal-free sensor. Binding
of Zn(II) selectively and quickly mediates hydrolytic cleavage of
the acetyl groups, providing a large fluorescence response. An acetylated
blue coumarin-based sensor was used to carry out detailed analyses
of metal binding and metal-promoted acetyl hydrolysis. Acetylated
benzoresorufin-based red-emitting probes with different zinc-binding
sites are effective for sensing Zn(II) ions in live cells when applied
at low concentrations (∼50–100 nM). We used green diacetylated
Zinpyr1 (DA-ZP1) to image endogenous mobile Zn(II) in the molecular
layer of mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), confirming that acetylation
is a suitable approach for preparing sensors that are highly specific
and sensitive to mobile zinc in biological systems.

==== Body
Zinc is an
essential nutrient
found in all tissues in the body. The vast majority of zinc ions are
tightly bound to protein scaffolds and play key catalytic or structural
roles.1 A smaller subset of chelatable,
weakly bound, or mobile zinc ions are present in high concentrations
in several tissues, including the brain, pancreas, and prostate.2−4 In particular, mobile zinc is concentrated in specific regions of
the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, and dorsal
cochlear nucleus (DCN), where it serves as a neurotransmitter/modulator.3,5−7 In the brain, mobile Zn(II) is loaded into presynaptic
vesicles of glutamatergic neurons by the zinc transporter protein
ZnT3.8 Synaptic zinc is released in response
to presynaptic action potentials and modulates several ion channels
and receptors, including synaptic and extrasynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs).5,9,10

Understanding the numerous, complex
roles of mobile zinc in physiology
and pathology requires adequate and sensitive tools for its detection.
Currently, there is a vast collection of zinc sensors for visualizing
mobile zinc in biology.11 Among them, the
largest class comprises fluorescent probes,12 many of which rely on zinc binding to alleviate photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) quenching between the chelating unit and the fluorophore,
leading to fluorescence enhancement. A general drawback with these
optical probes is that proton-induced background fluorescence reduces
the dynamic range in a pH-dependent manner.

Previously, we showed
that diacetylation (DA) of Zinpyr1 (ZP1)
appended to (6-amidoethyl)triphenylphosphonium (TPP)13 or various targeting peptides14 effectively quenches background fluorescence by disrupting the π-conjugation
of fluorescein, resulting in a substantially increased zinc-induced
fluorescence response by avoiding proton-induced turn-on. In the case
of DA-ZP1 derivatives, the zinc ion performs two functions: (i) its
Lewis acidity promotes rapid hydrolysis of the ester groups, restoring
conjugation of the fluorophore, and (ii) coordination to the two dipicolylamine
(DPA) zinc-binding units attenuates PET. DA-ZP1 derivatives are also
insensitive to intracellular esterases over a 2 h period and, upon
Zn(II) removal, the zinc-induced fluorescence is attenuated due to
PET in the metal-free state.13 Complete
reversibility is precluded by removal of the acetyl groups. The ample
zinc-sensitive turn-on, lack of proton-induced fluorescence, and ability
to be targeted to discrete intracellular locales make DA-ZP1 derivatives
ideal probes for biological imaging.

Here we inquired whether
acetylation could be used as a general
method for improving the sensing ability of several zinc probes, including
DA-ZP1 and three other sensors built on alternative fluorophore platforms
(Figure 1). To address
this question, we characterized DA-ZP1 in cuvettes, live cells, and
in DCN tissue slices, as a benchmark system for acetylation. Consistent
with our previous reports of DA-ZP1 conjugates,13,14 we found that DA-ZP1 exhibits no fluorescence in the metal-free
state and remains impervious to intracellular esterases for over 90
min. Additionally, DA-ZP1 accumulates preferentially in the Golgi
apparatus of HeLa cells and displays high endogenous zinc-induced
fluorescence signals in tissue slices. For a blue-emitting PET-based
sensor, we chose a DPA functionalized 7-hydroxycoumarin (CM1),15 which provides a single zinc-binding unit identical
to those in ZP1. A single ester group, readily introduced by acetylation
at the 7-position, not only effectively quenches the blue background
fluorescence of the probe, but also affords a monotopic acetylated
sensing platform that greatly simplifies characterization of deacetylation
kinetics. Acetylated-CM1 (Ac-CM1) was employed to analyze the effects
of various factors, including pH, other metals, and zinc concentration,
on the rate of deacetylation. Information gained from this work should
aid in the design of acetylated probes for a variety of applications.

scheme for zinc-mediated deacetylation of fluorescent
probes. (B) Chemical structures of Ac-CM1, DA-ZP1, and Ac-ZBR1/3.

Monotopic red-emitting sensors
were also acetylated and characterized
with an identical DPA zinc-binding site (ZBR3), as well as with a
(2-picolyl)(pyrazin-2-yl-methyl)amine binding arm (ZBR1).16 The ZBR probes are based on the benzophenoxazone
(benzoresorufin) chromophore, which, like the 7-hydroxycoumarin and
fluorescein dyes, presents an oxygen atom that can participate in
the formation of an [N3O] zinc-binding motif. Our results
demonstrate that acetylation can be used as an efficient general method
for improving the fluorescence turn-on of Zn(II) sensors and can provide
probes that are highly sensitive to mobile Zn(II) in live cells and
brain tissue slices.

Experimental Section
Photophysical
and Zinc-Binding Properties of Acetylated Sensors
All spectroscopic
measurements were carried out in aqueous buffer
(50 mM PIPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.0, unless otherwise indicated). Fluorescence
spectra for Ac-CM1 were obtained by excitation at 355 nm and acquisition
from 400 to 550 nm. For DA-ZP1, the excitation wavelength was 495
nm and emission spectra were collected from 500 to 650 nm. For Ac-ZBR1/3,
excitation was at 525 nm and emission spectra were collected from
550 to 750 nm. A 0.1 s integration time was used for all acquisitions.
Fluorescence data were averaged over three scans. The quantum yields
were standardized to quinine sulfate in 0.1 M H2SO4(aq) (λex = 360 nm, Φ = 0.55),17 fluorescein in 0.1 M NaOH(aq) (λex = 495 nm, Φ = 0.95),18 or
resorufin in 10 mM CHES buffer, pH 9.5 (λex = 572
nm, Φ = 0.74).19

Kinetics of Zinc Binding
and Deacetylation
Kinetics
of zinc binding to CM1 and deacetylation of Ac-CM1 were measured by
monitoring the absorbance at 357 nm using either a Cary 50 UV–visible
spectrophotometer (for slow kinetics), or by single-mixing stopped-flow
using a Hi-Tech SF-61 DX1 double-mixing stopped-flow apparatus equipped
with an absorbance detector. Buffers used were 50 mM PIPES, 100 mM
KCl for pH 6.0–7.75 and 50 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl for pH 8.0–9.0.
The observed rate constants (kobs) obtained
from all sets of experiments were calculated using Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software) to fit individual traces and by averaging the results for
individual fits.

Imaging Acetylated Sensors in Live HeLa Cells
The localization
of acetylated sensors in HeLa was investigated by incubating the cells
with Ac-CM1 (20 μM), DA-ZP1 (5 μM), Ac-ZBR1 (100 nM),
or Ac-ZBR3 (125 nM), and either BODIPY TR Ceramide (1 μM), ER
Tracker Green (250 nM), or MitoTracker Green (125 nM) in dye- and
serum-free DMEM. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C under a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2, the plates were washed with 2 ×
1 mL dye- and serum-free DMEM. Each plate was then bathed in 2 mL
of warm dye- and serum-free DMEM and imaged by multichannel fluorescence
microscopy. After acquisition of the initial set of images, the medium
in the dish was replaced on stage with 2 mL of a solution of 25 μM
ZnSO4 and 50 μM sodium pyrithione in dye- and serum-free
DMEM to increase intracellular zinc levels. After allowing the cells
to reach equilibrium (∼10 min), images were acquired, then
the zinc-enriched medium was exchanged on the microscope stage with
2 mL of a solution of 50 μM N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine
(TPEN) in dye- and serum-free DMEM, and the final set of images were
acquired after 10 min. A minimum of three plates representing two
passages was tested. Images acquired from at least three regions of
interest for each plate were processed and quantified using ImageJ.
For each measurement, the whole cell was selected as the region of
interest and the integrated fluorescence from the background region
was subtracted from the integrated fluorescence intensity of the cell
body region. Data are presented in Figures 4, 5, S26, and S29.

Imaging Mobile Zinc Pools in Acute Slices
of the Dorsal Cochlear
Nucleus (DCN)
All procedures using animals were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University
of Pittsburgh. Male or female mice (P18–P32) were deeply anesthetized
with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were quickly removed and sectioned
into 210-μm-thick coronal slices containing the DCN using a
vibratome (Leica). Slices were incubated in carbogenated artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (21 mM NaHCO3, 3.5 mM HEPES,
127 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2.4 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM glucose; pH ∼ 7.3, ∼ 310 mOsm) at 35 °C
for 1 h before being placed into the recording chamber. DA-ZP1 (1
μM) was added to the ACSF and allowed to equilibrate for 20
min before imaging with epifluorescent optics. DCN brain slices from
WT and ZnT3 KO mice were incubated in the same chamber, with the same
solution, and images were acquired at the same time. Slices were cut
so that both the zinc-containing molecular layer and the zinc-free
deep layer of the DCN could be visualized in the same image.20 Images were acquired with ephus21 and a Rolera XR CCD camera (QImaging) through a 20×
immersion objective (BX, Olympus). Fluorescence of ∼50 ×
50 μm ROI in the deep layer was subtracted from the fluorescence
of a ∼50 × 50 μm ROI in the molecular layer and
normalized to the fluorescence of the deep layer in the same slice.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Photophysical Characterization
By acetylating
the 7-hydroxy oxygen atom of CM1, the oxygen atoms in the 2′
and 7′ positions of the fluorescein unit in ZP1, and the oxygen
atom of the benzoresorufin portion in ZBR1 or ZBR3, we produced PET-based
zinc-selective sensors that are highly zinc sensitive and do not exhibit
proton-induced background fluorescence. Each acetylated sensor was
readily prepared by reacting the parent, either CM1,15 ZP1,23 ZBR1,16 or ZBR3,16 with acetic anhydride
for several hours or overnight. Reactions were monitored by mass spectrometry
or analytical HPLC to ensure completion and then purified by HPLC.
The purity and identity of the four acetylated constructs were confirmed
by spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques (Figures S1–S12).

The photophysical and zinc-binding
properties of each sensor were examined by UV–visible absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy (Table 1 and Figure S17). First,
we investigated a diacetylated (DA) version of the fluorescein-based
sensor, ZP1, in the absence of a targeting vector in order to directly
characterize the effects of acetylation on zinc binding, fluorescence
response, and cellular localization.13,14 DA-ZP1 is
spectroscopically silent at wavelengths >400 nm and nonfluorescent.
Zinc binding promotes cleavage of the acetyl groups, restoring visible
absorption (λmax = 505 nm) and emission (λem = 525 nm, Φ = 0.77), features consistent with those
reported for zinc-bound ZP1 and DA-ZP1 conjugates.13,14,23 The lack of background fluorescence provides
a dramatic 291-fold zinc-induced turn-on, compared to a fluorescence
turn-on of only ∼6-fold for ZP1 upon addition of zinc.24 When EDTA is introduced to remove zinc from
the sensor, absorption and emission features identical to those reported
for zinc-free ZP1 appear (λabs = 515 nm, λem = 531 nm), consistent with removal of the acetyl groups.13,14 Next, we investigated whether acetylation of PET-based sensors with
other fluorophores also quenches background fluorescence. Previously,
a DPA unit was appended onto 7-hydroxycoumarin to yield a blue zinc
sensor, CM1.15 The corresponding acetylated
coumarin-based probe, Ac-CM1, exhibits absorption features at 286
and 312 nm, but is nonfluorescent in the absence of zinc. Addition
of Zn(II) to Ac-CM1 induces a red shift in the absorption (λmax = 354 nm) and concomitant restoration of fluorescence emission
(λem = 445 nm, Φ = 0.84) with a large 70-fold
turn-on, an ∼20-fold improvement over CM1.15 The absorption and emission features observed are similar
to those reported for Zn(II)-CM1 (Table 1). Addition of EDTA restores absorption and
fluorescence features characteristic of metal-free CM1.

Next we investigated whether the acetylation strategy
could be
applied to red-emitting zinc sensors based on a benzoresorufin scaffold.16 ZBR3 contains a DPA zinc-binding unit identical
to those in CM1 and ZP1, but ZBR1 has a (2-picolyl)(pyrazin-2-yl-methyl)amine
zinc-binding unit in which one of the pyridine rings in DPA is replaced
with the more electron-withdrawing pyrazine unit. This substitution
enabled us to investigate the effects of acetylation on a sensor with
a different weaker affinity zinc-binding group. The Kd values for zinc-binding of sensors employing the (2-picolyl)(pyrazin-2-yl-methyl)amine
binding unit(s) are generally 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than
those observed for sensors containing one or two DPA binding arms,
making them more suitable for imaging cellular environments that contain
the canonical nM levels of mobile zinc.16,25−27 Ac-ZBR1 exhibits absorption features at 380 and 455 nm and a weak
fluorescence signal at 627 nm (Figure S17E). Addition of excess Zn(II) results in a rapid 42-fold increase
in fluorescence with a maximum at 620 nm (Figure S17F). Subsequent addition of EDTA removes zinc and restores
the absorption and emission features of ZBR1. Finally, we examined
the absorption and emission characteristics of Ac-ZBR3. Three absorption
features at 373, 454, and 587 nm and a modest fluorescence signal
at 626 nm were observed (Figure S17G,H).
Addition of zinc shifts the absorption spectrum to a single feature
at 534 nm and introduces a 12.5-fold fluorescence increase at 623
nm, a better than 2-fold improvement over the parent nonacetylated
ZBR3 sensor. The limited solubility of Ac-ZBR3, also observed for
ZBR3,16 may play a role in limiting its
fluorescence enhancement relative to those observed for Ac-ZBR1, DA-ZP1,
and Ac-CM1.

To confirm that zinc addition to each acetylated
sensor led exclusively
to the corresponding nonacetylated parent sensor without generating
side products, we performed correlated HPLC/mass spectral analyses
(Figures S13–S16). For each acetylated
sensor, we prepared a sample in buffer containing either excess Zn(II)
or excess EDTA. After a 5 min incubation period at room temperature
to allow the deacetylation reaction to proceed to completion, the
mixtures were quenched with 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water and then separated
by analytical HPLC, monitoring the samples at 250 nm and the corresponding
maximum absorption value for each probe (355, 520, 530, or 535 nm).
Mass spectrometric analysis of each peak indicated that the EDTA-containing
solutions contained only the acetylated starting material. On the
other hand, in the presence of zinc, no acetylated sensor was detected
and a single peak corresponding to the deacetylated sensor was observed.
These results confirm that the only species obtained upon zinc addition
is the parent nonacetylated sensor.

We examined the fluorescence
response of Ac-CM1, DA-ZP1, and Ac-ZBR1
at different Zn(II) concentrations (<1 nM to ∼25–200
nM) and found that all three sensors detect nM concentrations of mobile
zinc (Figure S18). As previously reported
for ZP1 and DA-ZP1-TPP, Ac-CM1 and Ac-ZBR1 have Zn(II)-selective fluorescence
responses over other biologically relevant cations, including Mg(II),
Ca(II), and first-row transition metal ions Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II),
and Cu(II) (Figure S19). Although these
paramagnetic metal ions can bind and quench fluorescence emission,
they are not readily available in free form in cells.28 Cd(II) produces a small fluorescence response, but cadmium
is not expected to be present in healthy eukaryotic cells. As discussed
in the next section, by using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy,
we found that some of these metal ions can, like Zn(II), promote the
hydrolysis of the acetyl group, but none can match the rate of Zn(II)-promoted
deacetylation (Table S2).

We examined
the pH-sensitivity of zinc-promoted deacetylation for
each acetylated sensor using fluorescence spectroscopy. In contrast
to nonacetylated ZP1 and corresponding conjugates, DA-ZP1 does not
undergo significant turn-on under acidic conditions, which greatly
facilitates the imaging of mobile zinc in acidic vesicles and compartments
(Figure S20). PET-based sensors like ZP1
rely on quenching originating typically from nitrogen lone pair electrons
of DPA and similar zinc-binding units.12 At low pH, one or more of the nitrogen atoms may become protonated,
interfering with PET to produce increased background fluorescence.
Acetylation with concomitant formation of the nonfluorescent lactone
ring in DA-ZP1 introduces a stronger quenching mechanism that abolishes
proton-induced fluorescence. Similarly, no significant fluorescence
response was observed for Ac-CM1, Ac-ZBR1, and Ac-ZBR3 under acidic
conditions.

Ac-CM1, DA-ZP1, and Ac-ZBR1/3 are readily synthesized,
display
strong fluorescence responses upon Zn(II) binding, are selective for
Zn(II) over other transition metal cations, and display no proton-induced
fluorescence. These results suggest that acetylation of PET-based
probes for mobile Zn(II) may be a general method for improving the
sensitivity of fluorescence for zinc imaging in biological milieu.

Kinetics of Zinc-Promoted Deacetylation
Acetylated
CM1 not only extends our sensor acetylation methodology to include
a blue fluorophore, but its monotopic nature, by comparison to the
ditopic ZP1 probe, allows for a straightforward investigation of the
kinetic properties of the zinc-promoted deacetylation reaction. Initially,
we monitored the deacetylation kinetics of Ac-CM1, Ac-ZBR1, and DA-ZP1
by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy in order to examine the
reaction by a means independent of the fluorescence response. Comparison
of the kinetic traces for zinc-promoted deacetylation of Ac-CM1, Ac-ZBR1,
and DA-ZP1 at pH 7.0 highlights the complex multistep deacetylation
of DA-ZP1 as compared to simpler single exponential kinetic responses
observed for monotopic Ac-CM1 and Ac-ZBR1 (Figure 2). Notably, similar rates were observed for
Ac-CM1 (kobs = 7.26(2) × 10–2 s–1) and Ac-ZBR1 (kobs = 7.73(6) × 10–2 s–1) at
pH 7.0. We chose Ac-CM1 as a platform for more detailed kinetic studies.
To characterize its deacetylation, we measured the rate of turn-on
following addition of excess zinc by monitoring the increase in absorbance
at 357 nm. Stopped-flow spectroscopy was employed to provide accurate
measurement of the rapid hydrolysis at 25 °C. We varied the concentration
of zinc relative to that of the sensor and observed no change in the
deacetylation rate from 2.5- to 15-fold excess zinc (Figure S22). Next, we measured the rate of zinc binding to
nonacetylated CM1. Because this binding event is very rapid at 25
°C, we performed these studies at 10 °C. Variation of the
concentration of excess zinc (>10-fold) yielded pseudo-first-order
rate constants that were plotted versus [Zn(II)]. From the slope of
the plot we obtained the second-order rate constant, 7.98 (±0.14)
× 105 M–1 s–1 (Figure S21). Given that both Ac-CM1 and CM1 share
a similar [N3O] binding motif, with the caveat that the
oxygen atom in CM1 is in the form of a phenolate whereas that in Ac-CM1
is part of an ester group, this result suggests that the rate of zinc
binding to Ac-CM1 at 25 °C will be much faster than deacetylation
of Ac-CM1 (kobs = 7.26(2) × 10–2 s–1) at the same temperature and
is probably not rate-limiting.

(25 °C, 50 mM PIPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.0). (C) Plot of observed
pseudo-first-order rate constants for the zinc-mediated deacetylation
of 5 μM Ac-CM1 (50 μM ZnSO4) as a function
of pH from 6.0 to 9.0 (blue circles, N ≥ 6
for each pH) and the spontaneous hydrolysis of 5 μM Ac-CM1 at
pH 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0 (black squares, N = 3 for each
pH) in aqueous buffer (50 mM PIPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 6.0–7.75;
50 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, pH 8.0–9.0).

Pseudo-first-order rate constants for zinc-mediated deacetylation
were measured from pH 6.0 to 9.0. The rates increased significantly
with increasing pH, from 0.006 s–1 to 2.57 s–1, which corresponds to half-lives ranging from 115
to 0.27 s, respectively (Figures 2, S23, and Table S1). Spontaneous
hydrolysis occurs very slowly in the absence of zinc and was measured
at pH 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. Although an increase in the pseudo-first-order
rate constant does occur with increasing pH, the rates are negligible
compared to those measured in the presence of zinc. Even at pH 9.0,
the measured half-life of 112 min was nearly 60-times greater than
that for the slowest zinc-mediated deacetylation, which was observed
at pH = 6.0 with t1/2 = 115 s (Figures 2, S24, and Table S1).

To investigate whether the hydrolysis
of acetyl groups could be
promoted effectively by other transition metal ions, a 10-fold excess
of the metal salt (Co(II), Cd(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), or Ni(II))
was added to solutions of Ac-CM1 in aqueous buffer and the observed
rate constants were compared to that for Zn(II) at pH 7.0 (Figures 3, S25, and Table S2). Zn(II) kinetically outcompetes Co(II),
Fe(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), and Ni(II) for the deacetylation of Ac-CM1.
Minimal hydrolytic activity was observed for Mn(II) and Ni(II), whereas
more rapid deacetylation rates were recorded for Co(II), Fe(II), and
Cu(II), consistent with hydrolytic activity reported for related complexes
of these metal ions.29−32 Although the rates for Co(II), Fe(II), and Cu(II) are higher than
those of Mn(II) and Ni(II), they remain slower than that of Zn(II),
suggesting an overall kinetic preference for this ion. Cd(II) also
hydrolyzes Ac-CM1 with a slower rate than that of Zn(II), but, unlike
all other metals examined, the kinetic trace did not fit a single
exponential function, implying a different kinetic mechanism (see SI for further details). Collectively, these
results demonstrate that sensor acetylation employing a DPA-based
[N3O] zinc-binding site not only retains the zinc selectivity
afforded by the parent sensor, CM1, as evidenced by fluorescence emission,
but also incorporates a kinetic preference for Zn(II)-promoted deacetylation.

Live HeLa Cell Imaging
To assess the ability of the
acetylated zinc sensors to detect mobile zinc in cells, we performed
live cell imaging experiments with each probe in HeLa. As with CM1,
Ac-CM1 is not taken up by these cells, and therefore no initial fluorescence
signal or zinc response was observed (Figure S26). DA-ZP1 effectively crosses the cell membrane, however, and, consistent
with the low concentration of endogenous zinc in HeLa,33 no significant background fluorescence was observed
after a 30 min treatment with a 5 μM solution of DA-ZP1 (Figure 4). After the medium was replaced with a solution of Zn(II)
and sodium pyrithione (ZnPT) in dye- and serum-free DMEM to enrich
the intracellular mobile zinc content, a large fluorescence turn-on
was observed. Application of TPEN, an intracellular zinc chelator,
reversed the fluorescence signal to the proton-induced background
level. Quantification of the intracellular fluorescence enhancement
of DA-ZP1 revealed an ∼70-fold increase, which is more than
10 times higher than that observed for nonacetylated ZP1.

We also investigated whether spontaneous hydrolysis of the
acetyl
groups could occur in the absence of zinc by monitoring the initial
fluorescence levels for 90 min prior to adding ZnPT (Figure S27). No appreciable fluorescence turn-on was observed
over this time period, and subsequent introduction of exogenous zinc
led to high (>70-fold) turn-on, similar to that observed immediately
following sensor incubation. We tested Ac-ZBR3 (125 nM) in a similar
manner, recording the initial, ZnPT-induced, and TPEN-sensitive fluorescence
signals (Figure S29). Quantification of
these data yielded a zinc-induced turn-on (2.5 ± 0.7) similar
to that observed for the parent sensor, ZBR3, but obtained by bathing
the cells in a solution of sensor that is 40-fold more dilute than
the one reported for nonacetylated ZBR3.16 This feature afforded by sensor acetylation is attractive because
it offers improved solubility and the ability to bathe the cells at
lower probe concentrations. Using less sensor reduces the possibility
of altering zinc homeostasis, for zinc sensors can chelate and alter
the cellular levels of mobile zinc, especially when applied at high
concentrations.33,34 Few other examples of small molecule
sensors that are effective at nM levels are known, including the zinc
sensor ZincBY-1, which was used at 50 nM for imaging zinc in mammalian
eggs.35 Furthermore, using lower loading
concentrations of cell-permeable sensors can reduce the risk of probe
toxicity. Finally, we examined the intracellular response of Ac-ZBR1
in HeLa by bathing cells in a solution of 100 nM sensor. Measurement
of the initial, ZnPT-induced, and TPEN-sensitive fluorescence signals
revealed that, even with a sensor incubation concentration 50 times
lower than that reported for ZBR1, a similar turn-on of ∼6-fold
occurred (Figure 5). As in the case of DA-ZP1, we measured
spontaneous hydrolysis of Ac-ZBR1 by recording the fluorescence levels
every 15 min for 90 min prior to the addition of zinc (Figure S28). Consistent with our observations
for DA-ZP1, minimal spontaneous hydrolysis occurred, confirming that
deacetylation is zinc-sensitive but is impervious to intracellular
esterases in HeLa cells, at least over the time scale of our experiment.

Because changes in the chemical structure of a probe can
radically
alter its cellular localization,36 we examined
the subcellular localization of DA-ZP1, Ac-ZBR1, and Ac-ZBR3 by coincubation
with various organelle trackers. DA-ZP1 was coincubated with the Golgi
tracker BODIPY TR Ceramide, because ZP1 is known to localize to the
Golgi apparatus.22,23,37 Quantitative analysis of the deconvoluted microscopy images confirmed
that acetylation of ZP1 did not alter this behavior in HeLa (Figure 6, Pearson’s r = 0.64 ± 0.09).
Ac-ZBR1 and Ac-ZBR3 were both coincubated with ER Tracker Green. Pearson’s
correlation coefficients of 0.53 ± 0.07 (Figure 7, Ac-ZBR1) and 0.64 ± 0.09 (Figure S30, Ac-ZBR3) indicate moderate to strong
colocalization, consistent with previous results for the corresponding
nonacetylated parent sensors.16 Thus, fluorescence
microscopy imaging of acetylated probes in live HeLa cells revealed
their stability toward the action of intracellular esterases and a
significant zinc-induced turn-on. Acetylated sensors can be applied
to live cells at concentrations that are more than an order of magnitude
lower than their nonacetylated counterparts, presumably due to enhanced
probe solubility and cellular permeability, providing fluorescence
turn-on levels at least as high or higher than that of the parent
sensors.

Application of DA-ZP1 to
Imaging Zinc in Brain Tissue Slices
To confirm that the acetylated
sensors could detect endogenous
sources of mobile zinc, we applied DA-ZP1 to acute brain slices of
the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), a cerebellum-like structure
in the auditory brainstem.38 Unique among
auditory brainstem nuclei, the molecular layer of the DCN has high
levels of ZnT3-dependent, synaptic zinc.20,39 Synaptic zinc acts as a neuromodulatory neurotransmitter in the
DCN that inhibits extrasynaptic NMDARs9 and triggers endocannabinoid release via activation of GPR39, a
metabotropic zinc receptor.40 Because high
levels of synaptic zinc are restricted to the molecular layer of the
DCN,20,39 the DCN is well suited for studying the
efficacy and specificity of our new cell-permeable zinc sensor DA-ZP1.
We prepared acute DCN slices (Figure 8A) and incubated them for 20 min in ACSF containing
1 μM DA-ZP1. Fluorescence microscopy imaging revealed increased
fluorescence in the synaptic zinc-rich molecular layer, but not in
the zinc-free deep layer (Figure 8B). Importantly, in brain slices prepared from ZnT3
KO mice that lack synaptic zinc, the molecular layer did not show
fluorescence greater than other regions of the slice (Figure 8C). Group data revealed that
the WT DCN had significantly stronger DA-ZP1 mediated fluorescent
signals in the synaptic zinc-rich molecular layer than the ZnT3 KO
DCN (Figure 8D). Sensor
acetylation allows us to incubate slices at 1 μM concentrations,
an order-of-magnitude less than that previously reported for imaging
brain tissue slices, and observe strong fluorescence signals.24 These results demonstrate that DA-ZP1 is well
suited for detecting chelatable zinc in acute brain slices.

molecular layer and the synaptic zinc-lacking deep layer. (B) Fluorescence
images of DCN slices incubated with 1 μM DA-ZP1 in ACSF for
20 min. The synaptic zinc-rich molecular layer of the DCN shows increased
fluorescence compared to the zinc-free deep layer in WT mice, but
the fluorescence was homogeneous in both layers in ZnT3 KO mice. (C)
Quantification of the radial fluorescence profile in B shows the molecular
layer has increased fluorescence in WT but not in ZnT3 KO, indicating
that DA-ZP1 detects synaptic zinc. (D) Group data showing that WT
mice have significantly higher molecular layer fluorescence than ZnT3
KO mice (WT = 181.1 ± 18.7%, ZnT3 KO = 103.9 ± 16.1%, p = 0.019, t test, N =
4, fluorescence values are normalized to fluorescence levels in the
deep layer).

Conclusions
Acetylation
of fluorescent zinc sensors is a robust method for
improving the turn-on and allowing for incubation of live cells and
tissue slices with much lower sensor concentrations, therefore avoiding
perturbation of metal homeostasis. Blue coumarin-, green fluorescein-,
and red benzoresorufin-based zinc sensors can be readily acetylated
in a single-step synthesis and purified by HPLC. These sensors display
pH profiles advantageous for biological imaging applications, are
zinc-selective, and are partially reversible owing to PET-based fluorescence
quenching from the zinc-binding group. Kinetic analysis of zinc-mediated
hydrolysis of Ac-CM1 shows that zinc kinetically outcompetes other
late first-row transition metal ions. The pH sensitivity profile indicates
that alterations to the zinc-binding site to decrease the estimated
pKa for hydrolysis can tune the rate of
deacetylation. For example, one may desire a sensor that will be hydrolyzed
at a rate commensurate with the pH of the organelle in which it accumulates
(e.g., the mitochondrial matrix at pH 8 versus secretory vesicles
at pH ∼ 5.5).41 Furthermore, addition
of the acetyl group does not alter sensor localization in live HeLa
cells, and acetylated sensors can be employed at concentrations approximately
10-fold lower than nonacetylated analogs. Finally, using DA-ZP1, we
obtained the first images of vesicular zinc in acute brain slices
of the DCN.
