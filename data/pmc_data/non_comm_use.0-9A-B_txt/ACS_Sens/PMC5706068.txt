Single-step immunoassays
that can be performed directly in solution
are ideally suited for point-of-care diagnostics. Our group recently
developed a new platform of bioluminescent sensor proteins (LUMABS;
LUMinescent AntiBody Sensor) that allow antibody detection in blood
plasma. Thus far, LUMABS has been limited to the detection of antibodies
recognizing natural peptide epitopes. Here, we report the development
of semisynthetic LUMABS sensors that recognize nonpeptide epitopes.
The non-natural amino acid para-azidophenylalanine
was introduced at the position of the original antibody-recognition
sites as a chemical handle to enable site-specific conjugation of
synthetic epitope molecules coupled to a dibenzocylcooctyne moiety
via strain-promoted click chemistry. The approach was successfully
demonstrated by developing semisynthetic LUMABS sensors for antibodies
targeting the small molecules dinitrophenol and creatinine (DNP-LUMABS
and CR-LUMABS) with affinities of 5.8 pM and 1.3 nM, respectively.
An important application of these semisynthetic LUMABS is the detection
of small molecules using a competitive assay format, which is demonstrated
here for the detection of creatinine. Using a preassembled complex
of CR-LUMABS and an anti-creatinine antibody, the detection of high
micromolar concentrations of creatinine was possible both in buffer
and in 1:1 diluted blood plasma. The use of semisynthetic LUMABS sensors
significantly expands the range of antibody targets and enables the
application of LUMABS sensors for the ratiometric bioluminescent detection
of small molecules using a competitive immunoassay format.

==== Body
The detection
of antibody–antigen
interactions is the basis for many bioanalytical and diagnostic assays.1 Both antibodies and antigens are important biomarkers
and the specificity of their interaction has been used to develop
highly specific detection strategies, either using antigens to detect
antibodies or vice versa. Antibodies are often detected
using heterogeneous assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), which involves immobilization of antigen and multiple
washing and incubation steps.2 Small molecules
can be similarly detected using a competitive immunoassay. Although
these traditional immunoassays are highly modular and sensitive, their
multistep nature limits their integration with point-of-care diagnostic
strategies. Ideally, a point-of-care test relies on a one-step assay
that requires minimal expertise on the part of the end user. Most
successful strategies for small molecule sensing at the point-of-care
rely on the detection of analyte-specific enzymatic reactions, such
as the electrochemical detection of glucose using glucose oxidase.3−5 However, this strategy is limited in scope as it relies on the availability
of an enzyme to catalyze the formation of a detectable product in
an analyte-specific manner.

Sensor proteins based on Bioluminescence
Resonance Energy Transfer
(BRET) are attractive for point of care diagnostics because they do
not require external illumination and therefore allow detection of
analytes directly in complex media such as blood serum. An early example
is the work of Trowell and co-workers who developed BRET-based sensors
based on G-protein coupled receptors that allow detection of diacetyl
with fM affinity.6 Recently, two new bioluminescent
sensor platforms, LUCIDs and LUMABS, have been reported that allow
direct in-solution detection of small molecules and antibodies, respectively.7−9 Both sensors are designed such that binding of analyte induces a
conformational change in the sensor, which modulates the energy transfer
efficiency (BRET) between NanoLuc, a bright and stable luciferase
emitting blue light, and an acceptor fluorophore. The LUCID sensors
developed by Johnsson and co-workers are based on the intramolecular
binding of a ligand(-analogue) to an analyte-specific receptor domain.7,10 The intramolecular interaction can be disrupted in a competitive
manner if the small molecule of interest is present at sufficiently
high concentrations, leading to a conformational change in the protein
that is accompanied by a decrease in BRET efficiency between NanoLuc
and a synthetic fluorophore. The LUMABS sensors developed by our group
take advantage of the bivalent architecture of antibodies to modulate
BRET efficiency between NanoLuc and an acceptor fluorescent domain.9 In this sensor design, NanoLuc is fused to the
green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen via a semiflexible linker domain.
The linker domain contains an antibody-specific epitope at both termini.
In the absence of antibody, NanoLuc and mNeonGreen are kept in close
proximity through helper domain interactions, which allow efficient
BRET. Addition of antibody disrupts these helper interactions because
the bivalent antibody–epitope interaction forces the linker
into a stretched conformation. The decrease in BRET efficiency results
in a color change from green to blue, which could be detected using
a conventional mobile phone camera.9

An attractive feature of the modular architecture of LUMABS is
that the sensor’s target specificity can be changed by simply
replacing the epitopes in the semiflexible linker. Thus far, the epitopes
that have been incorporated in LUMABS have been restricted to linear
peptide epitopes. However, the immune system develops antibodies against
a broad spectrum of molecular targets, including discontinuous conformational
epitopes, post-translational modifications, sugars, ribonucleic acids,
xenobiotics, and small-molecule haptens.11−16 The possibility to incorporate these more structurally diverse epitopes
into LUMABS would significantly extend the system’s applicability.

Here, we report a generic strategy to incorporate such nonpeptide
epitopes in LUMABS by the introduction of para-azidophenylalanine
(pAzF) as a bio-orthogonal chemical handle that allows site-specific
conjugation of synthetic epitopes via strain-promoted azide–alkyne
click chemistry (SPAAC). The feasibility and efficiency of this approach
is demonstrated by constructing semisynthetic LUMABS variants targeting
antibodies recognizing the small-molecule epitopes dinitrophenol and
creatinine (Figure 1A). In addition, using creatinine as a biomedically relevant example,
we demonstrate how semisynthetic LUMABS can be used for the detection
of small molecules in a competitive assay format (Figure 1B).

Experimental Section
Protein Expression and
Purification
A synthetic gene
encoding the flexible linker including two TAG codons was ordered
from GenScript, USA and cloned into a pET28a+ vector encoding a previous
LUMABS variant via restriction ligation cloning using KpnI and Spe I (New England Biolabs, USA). Correct
cloning was confirmed using Sanger sequencing (StarSeq, Germany).
The pET28a+ plasmid encoding TAG-LUMABS was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), together with
a pEVOL vector encoding a tRNA/tRNA synthetase pair enabling incorporation
of pAzF.17 pEVOL-pAzF was a gift from Peter
Schultz (Addgene plasmid # 31186). Cells were cultured in 2YT medium
(16 g peptone, 5 g NaCl, 10 g yeast extract per liter) in the presence
of 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol and
expression was induced using 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
and 0.2% arabinose in the presence of 1 mM pAzF (Bachem, catalog no.
F-3075.0001). After overnight expression, cells were harvested by
centrifuging for 10 min at 10000g. The resulting
pellet was lysed using BugBuster (EMD Millipore) and benzonase nuclease
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min, and centrifuged again for 40 min at 40000g. Pure pAzf-LUMABS was obtained from the resulting supernatant
using a combination of nickel-affinity and Strep-Tactin column chromatography
according to the manufacturers instruction (EMD Millipore and Qiagen,
respectively). Sensor purity was confirmed using SDS-PAGE and Q-ToF-MS.

Q-ToF-MS
All Q-ToF-MS analyses were performed using
a High Resolution LC-MS system consisting of a Waters ACQUITY UPLC
I-Class system coupled to a Xevo G2 Quadrupole Time of Flight (Q-ToF).
Proteins were separated (0.3 mL/min) by the column (Polaris C18A reverse
phase column 2.0 × 100 mm, Agilent) using a 15% to 75% acetonitrile
gradient in water supplemented with 0.1% v/v formic acid before analysis
in positive mode in the mass spectrometer. Deconvolution of the m/z spectra was done using the MaxENT1
algorithm in the Masslynx v 4.1 (SCN862) software.

Bioconjugation
DBCO–DNP was conjugated to pAzf-LUMABS
(5 μM) using a 20× molar excess of DBCO–DNP in 100
μL 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM desthiobiotin at pH = 8.0
(the elution buffer from the Strep-Tactin purification) for 5 h at
room temperature. Excess DNP was removed by repeated dilution and
concentration cycles using a 10 kDa MW cutoff Amicon filter. Product
purity was confirmed using Q-ToF LC-MS. DBCO-creatinine was conjugated
to pAzf-LUMABS in a similar manner, but using 7.5 μM pAzf-LUMABS.
In all cases, product purity was >90% based on the LC elution profile.

Sensor Characterization
Luminescence spectra were obtained
using a sensor concentration of 1 nM (DNP-LUMABS) or 5 nM (CR-LUMABS)
in a black cuvette (10 mm path length) on a Varian Eclipse Spectrophotometer.
Emission was recorded between 400 and 600 nm using a gate-time of
200 ms (DNP-LUMABS) or 5 ms (CR-LUMABS) and a bandwidth of 20 nm.
Titrations were performed at a sensor concentration of 10 pM (antibody
titrations) or 100 pM (creatinine titrations) in a total reaction
volume of 100 μL in a white 96-wells plate (PerkinElmer OptiPlate,
6005299), using a Tecan Spark 10 M plate reader recording luminescence
intensity between 400 and 600 nm at an interval of 15 nm. Substrate
(NanoGlo assay substrate, Promega, N1110) was added at a final dilution
of 5000×. Antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Anti-DNP,
9H8.1) and Randox (Anticreatinine, CR7.7A7). Equation 1 was used to fit titration curves for tight
binding, where the Kd is similar to or
lower than the sensor concentrations (DNP-LUMABS) 1  where P1 and P2 are a measure for the
emission ratio in the absence of antibody and the total emission ratio
change upon antibody saturation, respectively, S represents sensor,
and Ab represents antibody.

Equation 2 was used to fit binding for cases where the
sensor concentration was substantially lower than the Kd. 2  

Results
In order to incorporate
pAzF at the epitope sites in LUMABS, the
strategy described by Schultz and co-workers, using the amber stop
codon (TAG), was followed.17 In this approach,
a plasmid encoding LUMABS with amber stop codons (TAG) introduced
at the epitope sites flanking the central linker was coexpressed with
a plasmid (pEVOL-pAzF) encoding an orthogonal tRNA synthetase/tRNA
pair that specifically introduces the pAzF at the position encoded
by the TAG codon (Figure 2A). The DNA construct encoding the linker with flanking TAG
codons was produced synthetically (GenScript, USA) and cloned into
a previous LUMABS variant using a restriction–ligation approach,
replacing the old linker with the linker containing two TAG codons,
creating pTAG-LUMABS. Since some premature protein termination is
typically still observed as a result of noncomplete suppression of
the amber stop codon, a hexahistidine tag was incorporated on the
sensor’s N-terminus, while a Strep-tag was introduced on the
C-terminus. Together, these complementary purification tags should
allow purification of full-length protein, eliminating truncated protein
products.

with two TAG codons at the epitope is cotransformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with a pEVOL plasmid encoding

E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria were
co-transformed with a pEVOL-pAzf vector and the pET28a(+) vector encoding
TAG-LUMABS (see Supporting Information for
full DNA and amino acid sequence). After overnight expression, proteins
were purified using nickel affinity and Strep-Tactin column chromatography.
Sensor purity was verified using SDS-PAGE (Figure 2B). After nickel affinity purification using
the N-terminal His-tag, a significant amount of truncated protein
products was observed where protein production had terminated either
at the first or second TAG codon. The C-terminal Strep-Tag therefore
proved crucial in order to procure pure, full-length pAzF-LUMABS.
Analysis using Q-ToF LC-MS revealed a single species with a molecular
weight of 71359 Da, which corresponds well with the mass expected
for pAzF-LUMABS with two p-azido-phenyl alanine residues
(expected mass: 71358.8 Da, Figure 2C). Importantly, no evidence for the incorporation
of other amino acids or the reduction of p-azido-phenyl
alanine to 4-amino-phenyl alanine was observed.

Having established
the successful synthesis of LUMABS with two
pAzF moieties, we next tested the feasibility of reacting these azides
with DBCO-functionalized small molecule antigens. As a first target
we chose anti-dinitrophenol (DNP), which is present naturally in human
serum, but has also found widespread use in various bioanalytical
assays.18−20 DBCO-functionalized DNP (DNP- DBCO) was synthesized
in a single reaction step by reacting an amine-functionalized DBCO
with a commercially available DNP-derivative consisting of a DNP linked
to an NHS-ester via a short polyethylene glycol linker (Figure 3a, Scheme S1). Purification by preparative LC-MS delivered pure DNP-DBCO
(>90% pure) in a 68% yield. Incubation of 20 equiv of DBCO–DNP
with pAzf-LUMABS for 5 h resulted almost exclusively in the formation
of DNP-LUMABS with two DNP epitopes. LC-MS analysis showed a prominent
peak (>90%) with a molecular weight corresponding to the LUMABS
sensor
bearing two DNP groups (Figure 3b). In the absence of antibody, DNP-LUMABS showed a clearly
distinguishable emission peak at 517 nm, although the BRET efficiency
was somewhat decreased compared to the previously published HIV, HA,
and DEN-1 sensors (Figure 3c). Nevertheless, addition of 5 nM anti-DNP antibody to DNP-LUMABS
resulted in almost complete disappearance of the mNeonGreen emission
peak. A titration experiment showed an antibody affinity of 1.5 ±
0.4 pM and a dynamic range of 58% (Figure 3d). This very high affinity results from
the bivalent nature of the interaction between antibody and sensor
and was also observed in previously developed LUMABS sensors.9

(v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% Tween-20 at pH = 7.4. Error bars show mean
± s.e.m. (n = 2). Solid line represents fit
to eq 1.

To demonstrate the use of semisynthetic LUMABS
variants in a competition
assay format, we next developed a LUMABS to detect anti-creatinine
antibodies. The CR-LUMABS sensor incorporates the small-molecule creatinine
as epitope, and should be applicable as a sensor both for anti-creatinine
antibodies and, in a competitive assay format, for creatinine itself.
Creatinine is produced in muscles at a relatively constant rate, and
clearance of creatinine occurs through glomerular filtration. Therefore,
serum creatinine levels rise if the glomerular filtration is impaired,
making serum creatinine levels a valuable marker for kidney failure.21,22 In addition to the direct use of creatinine as a biomarker for kidney
failure, many other urinary biomarkers are reported as a normalized
ratio to urinary creatinine to correct for variations in urine production.23−25 In healthy subjects the serum concentration varies between 44 and
150 μM.26 In urine, the concentration
of creatinine is around 10 mM.27 Currently,
the standard method for creatinine detection is the Jaffé reaction,
a colorimetric reaction between creatinine and picric acid in alkaline
environments. Although the Jaffé reaction is inexpensive, it
shows limited sensitivity and several interferents are known, such
as metabolites and drugs that affect the readout.28 Moreover, it requires a large sample volume and is time-consuming
due to sample handling and pretreatment.

DBCO-creatinine (Figure 4a) was synthesized
in three synthetic steps according to Scheme S2; details of this synthesis can be found
in the Supporting Information. The regioselectivity
of the first critical step in this synthesis, the reaction of creatinine
with 5-bromovalerate, was assessed using 1D and 2D NMR. The correlation
peaks obtained in the 1H–13C HMBC for
H9 with C2 and C4 are consistent with the regioselectivities previously
reported in the literature.26 The absence
of cross peaks between C9–H10/H12 and C19–H1 is likely
because their corresponding long-range coupling constants approach
zero,29 which could be for a number of
reasons.30 (see Supporting Information, Figure S9). DBCO-creatinine was conjugated to
pAzf-LUMABS to create CR-LUMABS, using 20 equiv DBCO-creatinine in
a 5 h reaction at room temperature. Successful coupling was confirmed
using Q-ToF LC-MS, indicating that the reaction proceeded quantitatively
(Figure 4b). Titration
of anti-creatinine antibody to CR-LUMABS resulted in the expected
decrease in BRET, revealing an affinity of 1.3 ± 0.4 nM (Figure 4d). The amount of
BRET in the antibody-bound state was higher than that observed in
other LUMABS sensors, resulting in a relatively modest change in emission
ratio of 22%. The origin of this high amount of residual BRET is presently
unclear.

Measurements were performed in a buffer composed of 50 mM Tris, 100

bars show mean ± s.e.m. (n = 2). Solid line
represents fit to eq 2.

Next, we investigated whether
the formation of antibody–sensor
complex could be reversed by the addition of free creatinine. To ensure
that most of CR-LUMABS existed in the open conformation, we first
incubated 100 pM CR-LUMABS with 10 nM anti-creatinine antibody. The
excess of antibody was kept as low as possible while ensuring a near-saturated
sensor, as this should make the system most responsive to changes
in antigen concentration. Addition of low millimolar amounts of creatinine
(Kd,app = 276 ± 104 μM) was
sufficient to fully disrupt the antibody–sensor complex, allowing
CR-LUMABS to adopt its closed, high-BRET conformation again (Figure 5a). To establish
the kinetics of the competition reaction, we monitored the BRET signal
over time following addition of 1 mM creatinine to the sensor-antibody
complex. Figure 5b
shows that the exchange reaction is fast and equilibrium is reached
within a few minutes. Finally, we investigated whether the competitive
assay format could also be used to detect creatinine in more complex
matrices, such as blood plasma. For this purpose, 1:1 diluted blood
plasma containing the sensor–antibody complex was spiked with
different concentrations of creatinine. The performance of the sensor
system in blood plasma was comparable to that observed in buffer,
although the LOD (0.2 mM) was in both cases limited by the relatively
small change in emission ratio (Figure 5c).

antibody, to increasing concentrations of creatinine. (B) Emission

of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% Tween-20
at pH = 7.4. (C) Response of 100 pM CR-LUMABS, complexed to 10 nM

Discussion
In
this work, the chemical diversity of epitopes that can be incorporated
in LUMABS was expanded through the introduction of chemical handles
at the epitope sites, enabling post-expression conjugation using bio-orthogonal
click chemistry. An efficient expression and purification system was
established that allowed the incorporation of the non-natural amino
acid pAzF at each of the two antigen sites in sufficient yield, and
excellent purity. Moreover, subsequent reaction of the p-azido-phenylalanine groups with DBCO-functionalized small molecules
using SPAAC resulted in the exclusive formation of the desired LUMABS
variants with two small-molecule antigens. In addition to expanding
the scope of antibody targets, these newly developed semisynthetic
LUMABS variants are particularly attractive for small molecule detection
in a competitive assay format. A preassembled complex of CR-LUMABS
sensor and an anticreatinine antibody enabled the detection of creatinine
in the high micromolar regime, both in buffer and in blood plasma.

While the application of semisynthetic LUMABS for the detection
of the small molecule creatinine was successfully demonstrated, the
CR-LUMABS sensor displayed a relatively small ratiometric response
of 22%, a result of the relatively high amount of BRET in the antibody-bound
state. The reason for the high amount of residual BRET is not known.
One possibility is that the large hydrophobic cyclooctyne group causes
additional intramolecular interactions with either the NanoLuc of
mNeonGreen domain, resulting in a more compact antibody-bound state.
Alternative conjugation strategies that do not rely on the use of
cyclooctyns such as Cu-catalyzed click reactions with smaller, alkyne-functionalized
molecules may be explored to test this hypothesis. The modular architecture
of the LUMABS platform also allows for a systematic optimization of
several other parameters that could affect the amount of BRET in both
the antibody-free and antibody-bound states, such as the relative
order and orientation of NanoLuc, mNeonGreen and the helper domains,
the length and composition of linkers between the various domains,
and the type of anti-creatinine antibody that is employed. Another
sensor parameter that could be adjusted is the concentration regime
in which the assay is responsive to creatine. While the present system
is optimal for detection of creatinine concentrations in urine, the
creatinine sensitivity should ideally be a little bit higher for detection
of creatinine in serum. Shifting the responsive concentration regime
of the system toward lower creatinine concentrations may be achieved
by incorporating weaker-binding creatinine analogues in the sensor.7

Any molecule that can be functionalized
with a DBCO group or other
cyclooctyns such as BCN can now be used as an epitope for LUMABS.
Moreover, the expression plasmid TAG-LUMABS in principle allows the
incorporation of any non-natural amino acids for which orthogonal
tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs have been developed, allowing the extension
of the approach to include other conjugation strategies.31−33 Small-molecule sensing using LUMABS is therefore a generic approach
with a wide scope of potential applications. An important advantage
of the described sensing strategy is that it relies on the use of
monoclonal antibodies, which have been generated for a very wide range
of targets. The requirements for the strategy to work are the existence
of an antibody that binds the analyte with sufficient affinity and
the possibility to incorporate the molecule of interest (or weaker
binding derivatives) in the sensor via bio-orthogonal chemistry. Although
the sensor may contain weaker-binding antigen analogues, these should
still bind with submicromolar affinity to the antibody to overcome
the helper interactions and allow the sensor to adopt the open conformation.
Because binding of the small molecule analyte has to compete with
the LUMABS sensor that binds the antibody bivalently, small molecule
detection using LUMABS is probably most suited for the detection of
targets with concentrations in the micromolar to millimolar regime.
Possible fields of application of the described small molecule sensing
approach include diagnostic tests and therapeutic drug monitoring,
but also field tests in a veterinary setting or food testing at production
sites.
