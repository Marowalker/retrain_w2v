We report a strategy
for the fabrication of a new type of electrochemical nanogap transducer.
These nanogap devices are based on signal amplification by redox cycling.
Using two steps of electron-beam lithography, vertical gold electrodes
are fabricated side by side at a 70 nm distance encompassing a 20
attoliter open nanogap volume. We demonstrate a current amplification
factor of 2.5 as well as the possibility to detect the signal of only
60 analyte molecules occupying the detection volume. Experimental
voltammetry results are compared to calculations from finite element
analysis.

==== Body
Demands for
robust analysis at the clinical point-of-care1,2 as
well as for monitoring pollutants in the environment3,4 have led to diverse research directions toward the development and
further size reduction of miniaturized analytical chemical sensors.
Electrochemical detectors combine the advantages of being sensitive
tools with a low cost, small sample volume, and fast response time.5−9 Here, progress stems from the developments in microfabrication techniques
and their application in analytical chemistry.10−14 Microelectrodes in particular offer a superior performance15−18 with enhanced mass transport to the electrode surface resulting
in a fast response time and often low detection limits and high signal-to-noise
ratios.

The small surface areas of microelectrodes yield low
currents, which are often difficult to detect with conventional electrochemical
equipment.19,20 An effective way for signal amplification
is redox cycling, i.e., the successive oxidation and reduction of
analyte molecules at two closely spaced electrodes. As analytes travel
by diffusion between the electrodes, each molecule can shuttle up
to thousands of times per second, leading to an intrinsic amplification
of the current. In addition, in redox cycling only reversibly electrochemically
active species yield an amplified signal and two separated working
electrodes are employed, enabling biasing schemes for a highly selective
sensing,21,22 for example, by using interdigitated electrodes
(IDEs).16,23,24

Microfabricated
nanogap devices are a newer type of redox cycling devices which consist
of two planar parallel electrodes closely spaced (≤100 nm)
in a nanochannel, positioned as its bottom and ceiling in a thin-layer
cell configuration;25 or they can be realized
as pore-based structures in which electrodes are stacked in vertical
pores consisting of metal–insulator–metal layers.26,27 Due to this small distance these devices can be employed for a variety
of sensing schemes such as mesoscopic stochastic sensing, advanced
biodetection, and single-molecule electrochemistry.28−32 The fabrication of these devices requires several
steps of consecutive electron-beam or photolithography, depositions,
and dry etching, making the overall process rather complex.

Here, we report a novel nanogap transducer which we had previously
investigated by numerical methods.33 The
geometry consists of two electrodes positioned side by side at a 70
nm distance. The electrode pair is not covered to form a closed nanochannel,
but the active detection volume is directed to a larger reservoir.
The active volume is 20 attoliters, about 100 times less than previously
reported for closed nanogap devices.28 Our
device resembles an interdigitated electrode array16,34,35 with several unique properties: it only
has two fingers; the nanoscale interelectrode distance is considerably
smaller than in most IDEs;36−38 the electrode surfaces are parallel39 and are passivated on top. We characterized
the device by cyclic voltammetry and step amperometry to determine
the amplification factor, sensitivity, and time response, and compared
the experimental performance by two-dimensional finite element analysis.

Experimental Section
Device Fabrication
Two steps of electron-beam lithography were employed to pattern devices
on a silicon wafer substrate passivated by 300 nm thermally grown
silicon oxide. Figure 1A shows the fabrication scheme. First, two layers of methyl methacrylate
(MMA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (thicknesses of 300 and
150 nm) were successively spin-coated on the substrate. Two
3-μm-wide electrodes with a 70 nm gap in between were patterned
by e-beam exposure. Next, a 10-nm-thick Ti adhesion layer and 80-nm-thick
Au were deposited by electron-beam evaporation, followed by a lift-off
(hence, active volume = 3 μm × 70 nm × 80 nm ≈
20 attoliters). Subsequently, a 500-nm-thick PMMA passivation layer
was spin-coated. In a second e-beam exposure and development step,
only the gap area and connection pads were exposed. Microscopic top-view
images of a nanogap (Au and passivation layer) are shown in Figure 1B and C.

Chemicals
1,1-Ferrocenedimethanol,
Fc(MeOH)2, and potassium chloride, KCl, were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. All solutions were freshly prepared in Milli-Q water
with 1 M KCl as supporting electrolyte. The experiments were carried
out at room temperature.

Electrochemical Experiments
A Keithley
4200 parameter analyzer with two source measurement units was used
to separately bias both electrodes as well as to measure Faradaic
currents. A Ag/AgCl reference electrode (BASi Inc.) was positioned
in a reservoir on top of the nanogap device. Figure 1D shows the measurement setup.

Results
and Discussion
Fabrication of the Nanogap
Focused
ion beam milling has been employed for the fabrication of the nanogaps
for single molecule measurements in the field of molecular electronics,40−42 and it has the advantage of fabrication in a single milling step.
However, we found that this technique is not optimally suited for
our nanogaps: due to the Gaussian distribution of the ion beam, v-shaped
nanogap structures were obtained instead of parallel straight walls.40,43,44 Moreover, by employing ion beam
milling, not only the metal but also the passivation layer around
the gap are removed (with a Gaussian geometry); hence surrounding
the gap a large area of the electrodes remains bare without any passivation
on top.

Using e-beam lithography and lift-off, well-defined
clean sidewalls of two closely spaced electrodes are more easily achievable.
While we chose a gap width of 70 nm, also considerably shorter interelectrode
distances are feasible (possibly at reduced metal thicknesses). Moreover,
using this fabrication by deposition, lithography, and lift-off, electrodes
can be fabrication in a large variety of materials. A second e-beam
exposure defined the insulating layer; to avoid covering the nanogap
with PMMA due to misalignment, a wider opening was chosen (50 nm tolerance).
While this layer does not allow the use of organic solvent in electrochemical
measurements, it can be replaced by inert materials such as silicon
oxide.

Current Amplification
We compared the current of the
nanogap transducers in single mode (i.e., biasing only one electrode)
and in redox cycling dual mode to determine the amplification factor. Figure 2 presents cyclic
voltammograms for a device filled with 0.5 mM Fc(MeOH)2 in a 1 M KCl aqueous solution. In single mode (see Figure 2A,B), the potential of one
electrode was swept while the other one was kept floating. In dual
mode (see Figure 2C),
one electrode was swept (right generator electrode) from 0 to 0.5
V while the left collector electrode was kept at a constant reducing
potential of 0 V vs Ag/AgCl. Comparing the limiting currents in single
mode, Isingle, and dual mode, Idual, leads to an amplification factor of Idual/Isingle = 2.5.
The difference between the limiting currents of the right and left
electrodes (100 pA vs 75 pA at 0.5 V) in Figure 3C stems from the open geometry of the nanogap;
oxidized and reduced species produced at one electrode can diffuse
back into the solution before reaching the next electrode. Thus, amplification
factor and collection efficiency are reduced, and a collection efficiency
of Icollector/Igenerator = 75% was obtained.

Figure 2 Cyclic voltammograms of 0.5 mM Fc(MeOH)2 in
1 M KCl solution in the nanogap at a 5 mV s–1 scan
rate. (A) The right electrode was swept between 0 to 0.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl)
while the left electrode was disconnected. (B) The left electrode
was swept between 0 and 0.5 V while the right electrode was disconnected.
(C) The right electrode was swept between 0 and 0.5 V while the left
electrode was kept constant at 0 V.

rate. Inset: Limiting current at 0.5 V as a function of concentration:
5, 10, 100, 250, and 500 μM (lines are guides for the eye).

The Faradaic limiting current
for two planar opposing electrodes is determined as22 1  where n is the number of exchanged electrons, F the Faraday
constant, A the electrode surface area, D the diffusion coefficient, C the analyte concentration,
and z the interelectrode distance. Using eq 1 yields a current of I = 110 pA in good agreement with the experimental value
of 100 pA. The effective redox cycling volume in between the two electrodes
amounts to 20 aL, which is about 100 times smaller than in smallest
electrochemical nanochannel sensors.28,45,46

Concentration Effect: Detection Limit
In order to quantitatively investigate the detection limit of the
nanogap transducers, we performed cyclic voltammetry for different
concentrations of Fc(MeOH)2 in 1 M KCl solution as presented
in Figure 3. The right
electrode potential was swept between 0 and 0.5 V (at a 5 mV s–1 scan rate) while the left electrode was fixed at
0 V. Well-defined cyclic voltammograms were obtained for Fc(MeOH)2 concentrations down to 5 μM, showing in linear
response in the limiting current (see inset in Figure 3). For the concentration of 5 μM, corresponding
to an average number of 60 molecules in the active volume, a limiting
current of 1.5 pA was measured at the collector electrode. (Lower
concentrations were inaccessible due to an instrumental limitation
of 1 pA.)

Response Time
The response time is an important characteristic
of nanogap sensors;47 it is the time to
reach a steady-state current after a change in concentration (or a
change in local concentration induced by stepping an electrode potential).
In closed nanochannels, molecules have to diffuse from the bulk and
through the access holes along the entire nanochannel
(length L) to reach an equilibrium concentration.
The response time τ ∝ L2/D is further slowed down by reversible potential-dependent
adsorption of analytes and can amount to several tens of seconds.47,48

We investigated the response time of the side-by-side devices
by stepping the potential of one of the electrodes between 0 and 0.5
V and observing the current response at the other electrode biased
constantly at 0 V (see Figure 4). While the stepping electrode exhibits considerable transient
behavior due to parasitic RC charging,47 the collector electrode shows an instant response,
limited by the instrumental time resolution of 0.2 s. We estimate
that the actual response time of the device is much shorter, as it
only takes ∝80 nm2/D = 10 μs
to diffuse into its active area. Also, moderately fast sweeping in
cyclic voltammetry without hysteresis is facilitated due to this fast
response (see Supporting Information for
scan rates ranging from 1 to 40 mV s–1).

Figure 4 Step chronoamperometry
for 0.5 mM Fc(MeOH)2 in 1 M KCl solution. The left electrode
(blue) is kept at a constant potential of 0 V; the right electrode
(red) is stepped to either 0 or 0.5 V. Inset: applied potentials as
a function of time.

Numerical Analysis
We employed two-dimensional finite element analysis (COMSOL Multiphysics
4.4; see Supporting Information) to model
the electrochemical reactions in the nanogap, following up our previous,
more detailed numerical investigation of the effect of several geometric
parameters on redox cycling in the side-by-side nanogap geometry.33 Numerically and experimentally obtained cyclic
voltammograms for 0.5 mM Fc(MeOH)2 in 1 M KCl at
5 mV s–1 are compared in Figure 5 (a 50 nm tolerance of PMMA layer is considered
in the simulation as well). There is good agreement with the experimental
voltammograms slightly deviating higher potentials in redox cycling,
presumably due to slower electron transfer kinetics, and exhibiting
lower limiting currents. In redox cycling, the current is 5% lower
for the generator electrode and 26% lower for the collector electrode
with respect to the numerical values (at 0.5 V; see Figure 5C). We attribute these differences
to deviations of the device geometry (electrode height and distance,
alignment of passivation layer) from nominal values, as well as by
the fact that generated molecules can escape the nanogap at both ends,
which is not captured by the 2D simulation. For the same reason of
a 3D electrode, in single mode the 2D simulation yields lower current
values (see Figures 5A,B), leading to a high numerical amplification factor of 5. Compared
to our previous simulation33 (factor of
8) this amplification factor is lower because we take the wider opening
of the passivation layer into account.

Figure 5 Comparison of simulated
and experimental cyclic voltammograms obtained for 0.5 mM Fc(MeOH)2 in 1 M KCl solution at a 5 mV s–1 scan
rate for (A,B) single mode and (C) redox cycling.

Conclusions
We developed a new electrochemical nanogap
transducer geometry by placing two electrodes side by side at a 70
nm distance. Fabrication comprises only two lithography steps and
makes it possible to fabricate a wide range of gap sizes and make
use of different electrode materials, i.e., any material that can
be sputtered or deposited.

While our open geometry enables a
very fast response time compared to covered nanogaps, this comes at
the cost of a reduced amplification factor and a short residence time
of individual molecules between the electrodes. Thus, it is currently
not possible to perform single-molecule detection or mesoscopic sensing
as is possible in covered nanochannel sensors.

We are convinced
that—next to the shown advantages of ease of fabrication and
the possible variation of electrode materials—our devices will
realize their full potential in future planned experiments for three
reasons: First, the nanogap can be covered (e.g., with a glass coverslip)
enclosing a 20–100 aL nanochannel volume (depending of the
channel length), which is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller than
previously reported nanogap channels.30 Such small volumes make single molecule detection come into reach.
Second, the side-by-side arrangement allows direct access of optical
detection methods either from the top or through a transparent substrate
using an inverted microscope, thus enabling direct observation of
combined optical–electrochemical molecular properties.49 Third, e-beam lithography allows a further considerable
reduction of the interelectrode distance, increasing its sensitivity
and further reducing the active volume. Therefore, we anticipate that
the side-by-side nanogap transducers will form a versatile nanoscale
electroanalytical tool.
