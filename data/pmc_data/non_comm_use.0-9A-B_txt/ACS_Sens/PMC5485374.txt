FRET-based
caspase activity probes have become important tools
to monitor apoptotic cell signaling. However, their dependence on
external illumination is incompatible with light sensitive cells and
hampers applications that suffer from autofluorescence and light scattering.
Here we report the development of three caspase sensor proteins based
on Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) that retain the
advantages of genetically encoded, ratiometric optical probes but
do not require external illumination. These sensors consist of the
bright and stable luciferase NanoLuc and the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen,
fused together via a linker containing a recognition site for caspase-3,
-8, or -9. In vitro characterization showed that
each caspase sensor displayed a robust 10-fold decrease in BRET ratio
upon linker cleavage, with modest caspase specificity. Importantly,
whereas scattering and background fluorescence precluded FRET-based
detection of intracellular caspase activity in plate-reader assays,
such measurements could be easily performed using our caspase BRET
sensors in a high throughput format. The brightness of the BRET sensors
also enabled long-term single-cell imaging, allowing BRET-based recording
of cell heterogeneity in caspase activity in a heterogenic cell population.

Proteases play important roles
in cell signaling regulation in normal and diseased states and are
attractive targets for protease inhibitor mediated therapy.1 Caspases belong to the cysteine dependent class
of proteases and are key regulators of apoptosis, a critical process
in developmental biology and essential for tissue homeostasis.2 Caspases are also involved in inflammation, refinement
of mature neuronal networks, proliferation, and differentiation.3−5 Apoptosis is tightly regulated by a cascade of caspases that are
inert proenzymes before proteolytic activation.6 Caspases are activated via an extrinsic pathway, involving
initiator caspase-8, and an intrinsic pathway, initiated by initiator
caspase-9, which both lead to downstream activation of the caspase-3
and other subsequent executioner caspases.7 Dysregulation of apoptosis causes aberrant activation (or lack of
activation) of these pathways and is associated with cancer, autoimmune
diseases, and neurological and cardiovascular disorders.8

Many apoptosis assays focus on the detection
of late events in
apoptosis, such as externalization of phosphatidylserine, chromatin
condensation, and DNA fragmentation.9 Caspase
activation represents an early apoptosis marker and its detection
typically relies on application of fluorescent peptide-based substrates.
These assays are based on the release of a fluorophore reporter group
upon caspase cleavage, the separation of a fluorescent group conjugated
via a peptide linker to a quencher, or genetically encoded probes.10 The first two methods are usually limited to in vitro detection in cell lysates. Genetically encoded
caspase sensor proteins allow monitoring caspase activity on a single-cell
level in real time. Most of these sensors are based on Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluorescent donor protein
and an acceptor protein linked via a caspase-cleavable linker.11−20 The ratiometric response of FRET-sensor proteins renders them relatively
insensitive to variations in sensor concentration, while their genetic
encoding is attractive for live cell imaging and allows excellent
control of subcellular localization. Single-cell imaging with genetically
encoded FRET sensors revealed large cell-to-cell variability in the
time point of caspase activation following treatment with apoptosis
inducing agents. However, once the signaling threshold is reached,
the cell dies within 10 min.21 Although
FRET is highly useful in single-cell microscopy experiments, fluorescence
is incompatible with light sensitive cells and optogenetic applications.
Moreover, the requirement of an excitation light source introduces
problems such as autofluorescence and light scattering, which can
severely hamper applications in strongly absorbing or scattering media,
such as plate-based assays and in vivo imaging.

Sensors based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)
have recently received increasing attention as a viable alternative
to FRET-based biosensing.22−24 In these sensors, the donor fluorescent
domain is replaced by a luciferase enzyme, which generates light by
catalyzing the oxidation of specific organic substrate molecules.
Also, several examples of intensiometric bioluminescent assays to
detect caspase activity have been reported, including the use of caspase-activatable
luciferin variants,25 mechanically strained
circular luciferases,26 or cyclic luciferases,
whereby activity is restored upon cleavage by caspase-3.27 BRET-based detection of caspase activity has
been reported using Renilla,28,29 firefly,30 and click-beetle green luciferases22 conjugated to YFP or GFP, the fluorescent dye
AF680, and the red fluorescent protein tdTomato, respectively. Of
these systems, BRET sensors based on Renilla luciferase and its variants
have been most commonly used, both for caspase-3 and other proteases
such as thrombin.29,31−34 While these studies already showed
some of the benefits of BRET-based detection, these sensors still
showed limited brightness and used relatively instable substrates,
hampering their application in cell-based assays and precluding single-cell
imaging experiments.

In this work we report the development
of a family of bright BRET-based
caspase sensors based on the recently developed luciferase NanoLuc
(NLuc). NLuc is a small and highly stable luciferase that generates
a bright and glow-type blue luminescence that is 100 times more intense
than the luminescent signal produced by Renilla or firefly luciferases.35 Not surprisingly, NLuc is rapidly becoming the
luciferase of choice for numerous applications, including as donor
luciferase in BRET-based assays.23,36−39 To ensure efficient BRET in the absence of caspase activity, we
fused NLuc via a caspase-cleavable 17 amino acid flexible linker to
the fluorescent acceptor protein mNeonGreen (mNG)39,40 (Figure 1a). The
high extinction coefficient and quantum yield of mNG and the strong
overlap between the excitation spectrum of mNG and the emission spectrum
of the NLuc substrate (furimazine) contribute to efficient energy
transfer and thus bright acceptor emission in the noncleaved state.39 A 17-amino-acid linker containing a tetrapeptide
caspase recognition site was chosen to allow easy access by the target
caspases, while at the same time keeping the domains in close proximity
for efficient BRET. Three sensors were developed (C3-, C8-, and C9-BRET),
targeting initiator caspase-8 (Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp) involved in the extrinsic
pathway, initiator caspase-9 (Leu-Glu-His-Asp) from the intrinsic
pathway and the downstream executioner caspase-3 (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp).

Figure 1 (A) Schematic
representation of the BRET-based caspase sensor mechanism.
(B) Luminescence emission spectra of C3-BRET (10 nM) in the absence
(green trace) and presence of 10 μM caspase-3 (blue trace).
All measurements were performed in buffer containing 20 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM TCEP, and 1
mg/mL bovine serum albumin at pH = 7.1.

To allow thorough in vitro characterization
of
the functionality of the newly developed sensor, the sensor proteins
were first expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Luminescence emission
spectra showed efficient BRET for all three sensors, with the intensity
of the 517 nm acceptor peak being 2-fold higher than that of the 460
nm NLuc peak (Figure 1b, Figure S-1, green spectra). In all
cases, incubation with the target caspases resulted in complete disappearance
of the mNG emission peak (Figure 1b, blue spectra), representing a robust 10-fold change
in acceptor/donor emission ratio. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that
the decrease in BRET efficiency was due to specific cleavage of the
linker between NLuc and mNG, and not a result of unspecific degradation
of mNG (Figure S-2). While the response
of the BRET sensors is caspase specific, the sequences targeting different
caspases are similar and previous studies have shown only moderate
subtype selectivity.41,42Figure 2 shows the response of the three BRET sensors
in the absence of caspase and after 5 min incubation with each of
the caspases 3, 8, and 9 (Figure S-3, 60
min.). While each caspase cleaves its target sensor most efficiently,
selectivity is indeed limited. The caspase-3 recognition site seems
to be the most selective. Caspase-8 shows similar activity toward
all three sensors, while caspase-9 cleaves C8-BRET and C9-BRET with
similar efficiency, but is less reactive toward C3-BRET. In these
plate-reader based assays, a 6–7-fold change in emission ratio
was observed for all three sensors. Using 1 μM of the C3-BRET
sensor and 60 min of incubation, a limit of detection of 12.5 pM caspase
3 was determined (Figure S-4).

of the caspase sensors C3-, C8-, C9-BRET (1 μM)
after 5 min incubation in the absence of caspase (left 3 bars) and
in the presence of caspase-3, -8, or -9 protein (1 μM). All
measurements were conducted in buffer containing 20 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin, and 1 M sodium acetate to aid caspase dimerization,
at pH = 7.1. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3).

An important advantage
of bioluminescence is that BRET measurements
are easily performed on a population of cells using a standard plate
reader, whereas detection of FRET sensors typically suffers from a
high background due to autofluorescence and light scattering.31,38 We therefore compared the performance of the C3-BRET sensor with
SCAT3, a previously developed FRET sensor for caspase-3 developed
by Takemoto et al.12 To investigate the
performances of both caspase sensors in living cells, HeLa cells were
seeded in transparent 96-well plates and transiently transfected with
plasmid encoding SCAT3 or C3-BRET. Caspase activity was induced 48
h after transfection by the addition of protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine
(STS), a well-known apoptosis inducer.43 Emission spectra of HeLa cells transfected with SCAT3 showed a broad
peak around 470 nm (Figure 3a). This peak is present in both transfected and nontransfected
cells; however, addition of STS does not change the observed fluorescence
spectrum, despite the fact that fluorescence microscopy images showed
successful transformation and expression of SCAT3 in these HeLa cells
(Figure S-5). The similar spectra observed
for transfected and nontransfected cells therefore suggest that the
signal is dominated by background fluorescence and scattering, making
the FRET-sensor signal nondiscernable. This background is not caused
by the medium, as replacing medium by imaging buffer showed very similar
spectra (Figure S-6). In contrast, HeLa
cells expressing the C3-BRET sensor showed bioluminescent emission
spectra that are very similar to the spectra of the purified sensor
(Figure 3b). Moreover,
5 h incubation with STS results in complete disappearance of the mNG
peak at 517 nm, consistent with complete sensor cleavage. As expected,
nontransfected cells showed essentially no background luminescence,
clearly demonstrating the advantage of bioluminescent over fluorescent
detection for plate-based caspase activity assays.

Figure 3 Caspase activity measured
in HeLa cells. (A) Emission spectra of
nontransfected HeLa cells (light gray) and HeLa cells expressing the
caspase-3 FRET sensor SCAT3 at 0 h (black) and 5 h (light blue) after
addition of 5 μM STS, using an excitation wavelength of 410
nm. (B) Emission spectra of nontransfected HeLa cells (light gray)
and HeLa cells expressing C3-BRET at 0 h (green) and 5 h (blue) after
addition of 5 μM STS; emission spectra were measured using 40
filters covering the complete spectrum. (C) Absolute emission ratios
of HeLa cells expressing C3-, C8-, and C9-BRET at t = 0 and t = 5 h, in the absence and presence of
5 μM STS. Blue emission was recorded between 445 and 470 nm
and green emission between 505 and 530 nm. Error bars represent the
standard deviation of 8 different wells.

The performance of the BRET sensors to monitor caspase activity
in HeLa cells was further examined by recording emission ratios of
HeLa cells expressing each of the three sensors in the absence and
presence of STS (Figure 3c, Figure S-7). Emission ratios were very
similar for each sensor and remained constant over a period of 5 h
in the absence of STS. Addition of STS induced a clear decrease in
emission ratio after 5 h, consistent with complete sensor cleavage
in the measured time frame. HeLa cells expressing control sensors
in which the essential aspartic acid in the recognition motif was
mutated to an alanine showed emission ratios that were slightly higher
compared to the caspase-activatable sensors, possibly attributable
to decreased background cleavage (Figure S-8). The emission ratios for these cells remained high even 5 h after
incubation with STS, despite the fact that the cells did show clear
apoptotic morphological changes. Together, these results show that
the caspase BRET sensors provide reproducible, robust, and specific in situ detection of caspase activity.

Previous work
using FRET-based sensors revealed that there is substantial
heterogeneity between cells in the onset of caspase-3 activation following
treatment with STS.12,13,44 Having established the robust performance of C3-BRET to monitor
intracellular caspase activation on a population of cells in a plate
reader, we next tested whether its bright luminescence also allows
bioluminescent imaging of single cells. HeLa cells expressing C3-BRET
were treated with STS and subsequently imaged for 6 h using a bioluminescence
microscope. Fresh substrate was added at regular time intervals and
luminescence was imaged between 420 and 460 nm for NLuc and between
510 and 550 nm for mNG. Figure 4a shows pictures of the same cells imaged 2 and 4 h after
STS addition in which the green and blue channels are superimposed.
The robust change in emission ratio allows one to easily distinguish
cells before and after caspase activation by simply merging the channels
(Figure 4a). At 2 h,
the vast majority of cells are still green, and only a few blue cells
are observed that have undergone caspase-3 activation. After 4 h nearly
half of the cells showed the low (<0.8) emission ratio characteristic
of caspase-3 activity, while after 6 h 100% of the cells exhibited
caspase activity (Figure 4b). Figure 4c displays the absolute emission intensities of 10 consecutive 1
min images of cells 4 h after STS treatment. Please note that there
is a gradual decrease in emission intensities in both the blue and
the green channels during these 10 min because the concentration of
luciferase substrate decreases over time. However, by monitoring the
ratio of the blue and the green emission, three cells can be distinguished
that undergo caspase-3 activation within this time frame. In each
case caspase-3 activity increased rapidly, showing complete cleavage
of C3-BRET within 2–3 min, which is consistent with previous
work using FRET-based single-cell imaging (Figure 4c,d).12 These
results demonstrate that BRET-based imaging provides a feasible alternative
for FRET-based imaging for monitoring caspase activation on a single-cell
level for prolonged periods of time.

of three cells labeled in (C) showing caspase-3 activation. Measurements
were done at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s Medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, under humidifying conditions.

In conclusion, bright bioluminescent caspase sensors were
developed
that allow robust in situ detection of caspase-3,
-8, or -9 activity. The ratiometric and stable bioluminescent signal
offered by these sensors proved to be advantageous for high throughput
caspase activity assays and allowed long-term imaging of caspase activity
in single cells. While FRET-based imaging remains the method of choice
for high resolution imaging of a single cell in terms of sensitivity
and spatial resolution, BRET-based imaging provides an attractive
alternative for experiments involving light-sensitive cells and optogenetic
applications. BRET-based caspase sensors are also attractive for in vivo imaging. For these latter applications it may be
beneficial to develop red-shifted sensor variants, e.g., by using
the recently developed NanoLanterns-NLuc variants as a red-shifted
donor luciferase in combination with a red fluorescent acceptor proteins.34,37,45 Although the absolute intensity
of bioluminescence changes over time, the emission ratio was shown
to remain very stable over prolonged periods of time, responding only
to caspase-induced cleavage. These sensors thus provide attractive
tools for high-throughput cell-based drug screening to monitor caspase-mediated
apoptosis, and can also be adopted, after replacement of the protease
recognition sequence, to other protease-related cell signaling processes.
