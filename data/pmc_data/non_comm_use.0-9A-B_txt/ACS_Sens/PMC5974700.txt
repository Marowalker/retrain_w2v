Scalable
immunoassay multiplexing offers a route to creating rapid
point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. We present a method for multiplexing
immunoassays on the surface of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) sensor array integrated circuit (IC) without the use of physical
separators such as wells or channels. Major advantages of using a
CMOS sensor array include low mass-manufacturing costs, the possibility
to multiplex multiple assays on a single IC, and improved signal when
averaging multiple sensors, along with providing a platform where
wash steps can be incorporated to maximize selectivity and sensitivity
compared to paper based lateral flow immunoassay. The device was able
to differentiate between samples containing either, neither, or both
rabbit anti-mouse (RAM) antibodies and/or anti-HIV gp120 antibodies
in serum using a gold-nanoparticle promoted silver enhancement immunoassay.
HIV antibody concentrations down to 100 μg/mL were readily detected,
which is three times lower than those typically found in infected
humans (300–500 μg/mL), and the limit of detection was
10 μg/mL.

==== Body
Many medical
tests are invasive,
time-consuming, and usually require specialist medical centers. A
time-lag therefore ensues while samples are analyzed remotely, and
a repeat visit to the medical center is required to discuss outcomes.
Furthermore, the ability to home-test for various diseases has improved
the ability for rapid diagnosis and implementation of appropriate
medical intervention. Home pregnancy testing represents the prime
example.1,2 A hand-held device not only increases convenience
but also offers diagnostics in remote areas where laboratory tests
are not locally available.

The usefulness of mobile phones in
health care has already been
demonstrated.3−9 Testing for a multitude of substances that are indicative of disease
could be done using devices that link to a smartphone and measure
analytes within a drop of blood. The work presented here provides
a step in that direction through detection of anti-HIV and rabbit
anti-mouse (RAM) antibodies on a hand-held chip-based device (Figure 1). The HIV assay
used in this paper has been proven to work with whole blood.10

Figure 1 Immunoassay capable smartphone accessory. Images showing
the construction
of the CMOS chip carrier (A, B) and data acquisition electronics (C)
which can be connected to a smartphone or a PC (D). The CMOS chip
carrier fits into the socket on the chip PCB. An LED and cover and
mounted on top of the chip PCB. On the other side of the chip PCB
there are sockets to plug in the mbed (ST-Nucleo) board which handles
the data acquisition and communication with the smartphone/PC. The
smartphone app is shown displaying the acquired data in visual and
numerical form. Colored crosses can be moved around to choose the
individual pixels being charted.

Antibodies are soluble proteins that circulate in blood and
bind
specifically to foreign molecules (antigens) as part of the adaptive
immune response.11 Antibodies are frequently
exploited in immunoassays for diagnostic purposes as their production
is in direct response to the presence of foreign antigens in the host
system. In a direct immunoassay, the presence of the disease (antigen)
is detected using exogenous antibodies specific to the antigen. In
an indirect immunoassay, it is the presence of an antibody to a specific
disease (antigen) that is detected (immune response). It is much easier
to detect antibodies due to their abundance,12−14 although the
body needs some time to produce antibodies after being infected (a
process termed seroconversion).

Complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) technology has revolutionized
the microelectronic industry, being both low-cost and reliable. In
this paper, we demonstrate concurrent, interference-free execution
of two optical immunoassays on the surface of a CMOS sensor array
chip to detect antibodies targeted to the immunodominant gp120 antigen
of HIV, and also antibodies to a second antigen (mouse IgG), demonstrating
the potential to develop a multiplexed assay system on the surface
of a CMOS sensor array.

Multiple analyte detection is the key
to creating a useful health
diagnostic device. A proof of concept sandwich immunoassay was developed
to demonstrate the functionality of a phone-CMOS platform. In the
RAM assay, rabbit anti-mouse antibodies bind to printed mouse antibodies
on the surface of the chip. These antibodies are detected with gold-labeled
goat anti-rabbit antibodies.

This assay can be easily modified
to detect useful real world analytes
such as antibodies to HIV, syphilis, hepatitis, malaria, West Nile
virus, Chagas disease, herpes, and Zika. The technology presented
can be adopted to create a single diagnostic chip, for example, that
corresponds to all sexually transmitted diseases or pathogens known
to cause fever in tropical settings. As it is often hard to ascertain
the cause of fever in tropical areas, such a tool would be invaluable.
In the assays presented here, droplets of the assay solution were
manually printed onto the chip using a polystyrene needle. However,
other technologies exist capable of printing much smaller droplets,
which in turn would increase the number of assays available on a chip.15,16

HIV was chosen for demonstration as it remains a major global
public
health issue, having claimed more than 35 million lives so far. It
is estimated, however, that only 54% of people with HIV know their
status (WHO facts, 2016). Including HIV testing on any personal health
diagnostic tool is extremely important. While rapid HIV testing already
exists17−19 our ultimate aim is to integrate HIV testing with
other assays into a single device. Having an HIV test in a personal
health machine would be beneficial as it would increase the convenience,
privacy and reach of HIV testing. Being easy, low-cost, and anonymous,
it could be used in areas where conventional testing is not available.

Immunoassay formats reported in refs (10) and (20) allow multiple assays to be performed on the surface of
a single chip where different proteins can be positioned with precision
on the chip surface. The assay then uses changes in the absorption
of light applied to the surface allowing detection with a photodiode.
The sensitivity of the silver-amplified immunoassay reported in ref (10) rivals that of the gold
standard laboratory-based HIV ELISA tests, but also includes antigens
capable of detecting seroconversion to syphilis. A polystyrene microfluidic
cassette, with individual detectors for each assay, thus offers a
system that can detect HIV and syphilis in a drop of blood, using
a smartphone accessory. While proving the ability to make multiple
assays on a single chip, scaling up the total number of possible assays
is restricted by engineering requirements for the microfluidic cassettes.

A major advantage of using silicon CMOS technology is that it readily
allows for miniaturization so that multiple sensors can be cointegrated
at low cost. Furthermore, the ability to integrate electronic functionality
such as signal amplification and data multiplexing from an array of
sensors enables new multiple assay technologies to be realized. While
CMOS possesses many of the required attributes of a biosensor technology,
a certain amount of post-processing (back-end of line) is necessary,
and we show how a readily available epoxy based photoresist used for
microelectro-mechanical systems, SU-8, can be exploited to facilitate
assay immobilization technology, making multiple assays on a single
chip possible. The combination of CMOS and immobilization technologies
allows qualitative analysis from multiple assays simultaneously with
the sensitivity needed to measure physiological levels of antibodies
found for many diseases in human blood.

The CMOS array presented
has 256 sensors. With sufficiently advanced
inkjet printing technology, each couple of sensors can be functionalized
to perform different immunoassays. Even with the manual printing technique
used in this work, up to six droplets were printed on a single chip
with functioning antibodies. However, there are only three distinct
biological assays presented here (including the control).

Results and Discussion
Instrumentation
and Measurement System
An ARM mbed
data acquisition platform was assembled that can be connected to a
smartphone/PC via USB or Bluetooth (Figure 1C–D). An Android app was created to
evaluate the usefulness of a smartphone connected blood testing device.

Once the chip was packaged and processed and the immunoassay was
executed, the chip was inserted into a PGA ZIF socket attached to
a custom printed circuit board (Newbury Electronics, UK) designed
to connect the chip carrier to the COTS mbed board (NUCLEO-F334R8,
STMicroelectronics).

An external power supply was used to power
the chip during all
experiments presented. However, USB OTG was used to power and communicate
with the entire system during smartphone connected trials.

Initial
experiments to verify the chip and the assay were conducted
with the platform attached to a PC, but as the technology matured
we connected the platform to a smartphone to fulfill our objective.
The USB serial interface of the mbed board was used for communication.
First, the PC/smartphone sends a command byte to the mbed, and then
the mbed sends back 256 bytes, each corresponding to a pixel readout.
The bytes are counted to make sure no data loss occurred and then
presented on the screen. Also, all the data is streamed to permanent
storage using the CSV file format or, in the case of LabView, the
National Instruments TDMS file format. Reading an entire frame in
this way takes less than 100 ms. The serial bus is set to run at 115 200
baud.

The mbed measures the voltage output of each pixel with
the use
of its analog to digital converter (ADC). It iterates through all
the pixels in the array by outputting their digital addresses in sequence.
Once a valid address is presented, the voltage output of the corresponding
pixel appears on the analog output pin. It sends all the acquired
data through its serial interface.

The USB OTG connected android
acquisition app developed surpassed
the PC based LabView VI in both stability and speed. Another advantage
of a wired (not Bluetooth) smartphone accessory is that it does not
need its own power source. The android app is available for download
in the Google Play store under “Multicorder USB”.

Experimental Results
Antibody detection was chosen
over antigen detection in this study (Figure 2) because of the relative ease of detection
of antibodies in seroconverted blood.12,13 However, sandwich
assays using a bait antibody to capture proteins from serum, which
can then be detected using a second antibody, this time gold nanoparticle
labeled, would be equally useful with this same setup.

Figure 2 Drawings showing the
biochemical construction of the HIV and the
RAM assay. These assays are built step by step on the surface of the
chip with washes in between each step. The aim is to detect the presence
of HIV antibodies and/or anti-mouse rabbit (RAM) antibodies in rabbit
serum independent of each other, concurrently, in the same sample
solution. [1] The chip is covered with SU-8 photoresist. [2] Two droplets
are printed on the surface of the chip: one containing HIV gp120 antigen
and one containing mouse IgG (both in bicarbonate buffer, 10 μg/mL).
Next, the chip is covered with [3] BSA blocking buffer (PBS, 1%),
[4] rabbit serum containing either, both, or neither anti-HIV gp120
rabbit antibodies and anti-mouse rabbit (RAM) antibodies (this is
the analyte, 100 μg/mL, 65% rabbit serum, PBS), [5] gold conjugated
anti-rabbit antibody (A520 = 0.1), [6] silver nitrate/hydroquinone
solution (citrate buffer).

A positive response results in the appearance of dark spots
at
positions where the corresponding proteins were printed. Otherwise,
the image is homogeneous. Spectral transmission of the silver spots
was measured with a spectrophotometer to aid in the choice of an LED
emitting light at the correct wavelength, although there was no significant
practical advantage of using one color over the other. The system
we present is analogous to an ELISA type assay but miniaturized and
amenable to simple electronic readout using a smartphone. The sensor
chips were fully characterized before performing the experiments.

The sensor array was functionalized by the addition of droplets
containing different proteins, including the HIV gp120 protein and
the mouse IgG (Figure 3A,B). The droplets were printed manually with a polystyrene needle.
The antigens dissolved in the droplets adhered to the surface via
direct physisorption. Once the chip was functionalized and washed,
the entire chip was treated with BSA blocking buffer to avoid nonspecific
antibody binding. Antibodies specific to these proteins were then
added and nonspecifically bound antibody washed from the chip surface.
Nanogold-labeled secondary antibodies were then added to bind to those
primary sera and these caused the precipitation of added silver within
their direct vicinity when this later reagent was added. The precipitation
masks photons from the LED from reaching the photodiode detectors
at the CMOS surface and the increase in absorbance is detected electronically.

Figure 3 Multiplexed
HIV/RAM assay results in serum on CMOS chip with SU-8
surface. (Serum was diluted with water 65:35, data acquisition system
was connected to a smartphone.) (A) Typical size and position of printed
droplets. HIV gp-120 antigen solution on the top left, mouse IgG solution
on the bottom right. (B) The epoxy walls and the misalignment of the
illumination create a background gradient signal. To correct for this,
each printed droplet has a corresponding control area in the same
column. While measurements of the chip before carrying out the assay
provide some control data, by measuring control pixels on the chips
after the assay is done more faithfully enables accurate interpretation
of the data. (C) The difference in the printed and control area signals
can be used to chart different experiments (executed on different
devices) together. This differential signal is averaged over 12 experiments
and charted (3 repeats of HIV+, RAM+, combination, and negative control
experiments). (D) Images and bar charts displaying data acquired from
the chip. There are four possible different outcomes of HIV/RAM multiplexed
assay. If the rabbit serum sample contains HIV rabbit antibodies,
the HIV area develops a dark spot, if it contains rabbit anti-mouse
(RAM) antibodies, then the RAM area develops a dark spot. Typically
10–30 pixels are averaged to calculate the signal level of
a printed/control area. The contrast of these grayscale images was
enhanced for illustration purposes.

Once the assay was complete, the chip was dried and inserted
into
the measurement system and the incident light on the printed areas
was measured and plotted with data from the negative control areas
which remained transparent. Experiments were repeated at least three
times on different devices with similar results. Run-to-run variation
that can occur with the illumination system in our prototype was compensated
for in the data presentation by graphing the difference between control
and active areas over many experiments (Figure 3C).

Figure 3D shows
the results of positive and negative HIV and rabbit anti-mouse (RAM)
tests in serum printed on the surface of the SU-8 coated chip. For
each of these experiments, two droplets were printed on the surface:
one for the HIV and one for the RAM assay. The printed surfaces only
turned dark if the test was positive; that is, antibody specific for
the target antigen was present in the serum. Negative control (HIV-/RAM-)
experiments were executed with the same analyte solution (rabbit serum)
but without the addition of the target antibody.

The data clearly
demonstrates that the system can make two separate
assay measurements concurrently on the same chip, without interference.
The data we obtained was of sufficiently high quality to enable automated
electronic threshold analysis to determine the diagnostic outcome.

It can be seen that the voltage difference between positive and
negative control areas was 0.16 V for HIV and 0.36 V for RAM, on average.
The lowest difference we observed for a positive HIV assay was 0.1
V while the largest difference between negative control areas was
0.07 V. The achievable electronic limit of detection is set by the
supply voltage (3.3 V) and the number of bits of the analog to digital
converter (8) to be 0.01 V. The data are therefore considerably larger
than the errors we determined from the system; hence, we estimate
that any assay that produces a voltage difference of more than 0.09
V can be considered positive.      

The results of Figure 3D were obtained by using the averaging capabilities from multiple
independent pixels provided by the photodiode sensor array: antigen
droplets were printed on the surface such that each droplet covered N = 9–30 sensors (Figure 3B). The signal standard deviation is reduced
by √N, where N is the number
of sensors. When the data was acquired the location of these pixel
clusters were known, using optical microscopy, and used to produce
an averaged result. Negative control areas were also chosen and, again,
the average signal from the cluster of pixels was taken. Antibodies
tended to concentrate at the edges of the droplet, and so the edges
became darker than the middle (coffee ring effect21). By averaging the entire area covered by the droplets,
false negative results could be avoided. The analyte (HIV gp120 antibody,
anti-mouse rabbit antibody) concentration detected was 100 μg/mL
in rabbit serum (65%) diluted with PBS. The detection part of the
assay took 45 min (analyte incubation, gold labeled antibody incubation,
silver development).

In order to characterize the assays in
depth, the parameter space
for all of the reagents and the reaction time was studied. A complementary
set of experiments was conducted on polystyrene, the same material
that is used for ELISA plates, the current gold standard in immunoassays.
Polystyrene slides were placed on top of the CMOS chip. The CMOS chip
was masked by a cover with a small hole in the middle, focusing light
to the area of interest in the polystyrene slide. The entire photodiode
array was averaged in this case, so the chip functioned as an ELISA
plate reader. The assay referred to as positive control (rabbit IgG)
assay is a simpler version of the RAM assay: gold conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG binds to the printed rabbit IgG on the surface.

Figure 4A shows
the outcome of the HIV assay when the antibodies in the analyte were
present (HIV+), absent (HIV-), and when the gp120 capture protein
on the surface is absent (BSA-). Figure 4B,C shows the outcome of the HIV assay when
the concentration of the printed HIV gp120 antigen or the rabbit anti-gp120
antibody was varied. These graphs can be used to determine the minimum
concentration of printed antigen required, as well as the minimum
detectable concentration of anti-gp120 antibody. Figure 4B represents 2 separate runs
of experiments with 4 droplets printed for each data point. Figure 4C represents a single
run of experiments with 2 droplets printed for each data point (since
this assay was repeated with fixed concentrations many times, no further
repeats were deemed necessary).

Figure 4 Assay characteristics on polystyrene (A–E)
and glass (F).
(Data acquisition system was connected to a PC.) (A) Result of two
negative control assays and an HIV+ assay were measured by the photodiode
array. The HIV- assay is an HIV assay where the anti-gp120 antibody
was substituted with IgG solution to simulate a negative sample, whereas
the BSA- assay lacks the HIV capture protein (gp120) on the surface,
so the anti-gp120 antibody in the analyte has nothing to bind to.
(B) HIV antibody concentration of the HIV+ assay was varied. (C) Printed
HIV antigen concentration of the HIV+ assay was varied. (D) Silver
development time of the positive control assay was varied. (E) Concentration
of the gold conjugated antibody solution of the positive control assay
was varied. (A520 is a measure of light absorbance at 520 nm which
is directly proportional to the concentration of gold conjugated antibodies).
(F) Transmission spectrum of a silver spot developed on an SU-8 covered
glass slide, showing wavelength independence. Measured using a spectrophotometer.
(A–E) Default parameters: 10 μg/mL gp120, 100 μg/mL
rabbit anti-gp120, 15 min silver development.

Figure 4D,E
shows
results of the positive control (rabbit IgG) assays with two parameters
varied. These experiments serve two purposes. They demonstrate the
effects that reagent concentrations and development time have on the
outcome. They also indicate the minimum required concentrations and
time needed to detect antibodies.

Figure 4D shows
the outcome of the positive control experiment as the silver development
time is varied to determine the minimum amount of time required for
the silver to develop on positive control areas. The assay needs at
least 10 min to produce a significant difference between positive
and negative control areas. Accordingly, 15 min was chosen as the
minimum amount of development time that guarantees a successful positive
control. `Figure 4D represents 5 droplets for each data point acquired from two separate
runs of the experiment.

Figure 4E shows
how the outcome of a positive control experiment changes when varying
the secondary gold conjugated antibody concentration. The assay starts
working at a dilution of 1:100 (A520 =
0.05) and continues to improve as the concentration goes up. A 1:50
dilution (A520 = 0.1) was chosen to ensure
sufficient antibody is present to indicate a positive result without
using an excessive amount of reagent, which has an economic benefit. Figure 4E represents a single
run of assays, 3 droplets were printed for each data point (since
this assay was repeated with fixed concentrations many times, no further
repeats were deemed necessary).

Materials
and Methods
CMOS Sensor Chip
The sensor chip used in this work
incorporates an array of 16 × 16 pixels. Each pixel incorporating
a p–n junction photodiode with three transistors for readout.22 The chip uses a global shutter scheme for exposure
and a scanning scheme for acquisition where one 4-bit row decoder
and one 4-bit column decoder are integrated outside the active area.

The chip measures 3.4 mm × 3.6 mm and was fabricated using
the AMS 0.35 μm CMOS process. The chip was designed so its wire
bonds are only on two sides of the chip. This allows easy access to
the surface of the chip. For our work we used a custom designed photodiode
array since commercially available devices are packaged in such a
way that they inhibit experimentation. In the future, commercial chips
could be used.

Chip Packaging
The bond wires and
parts of the chip
were protected from aqueous reagents and cleaning solutions (Figure 1A,B). The chip was
mounted on a chip carrier using epoxy (EPO-TEK H74). The epoxy was
cured at 150 °C for 10 min. The chip was then wire bonded to
the chip carrier. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cuboids were used to
cover the chip sensor area and to make a channel leading to the edges
of the chip carrier. Next, epoxy resin (EPO-TEK 302-3M) was applied
to the bond wires and bond pads. The PDMS cuboids prevented epoxy
from covering the surface of the sensor array. The epoxy was cured
at room temperature for 24 h. Then the chip was covered with SU-8
3005 photoresist and spun at 1500 rpm for 30 s. The channel leading
to the edge of the chip carrier allows the excess resist to escape
the surface of the chip while spinning. The resist was cured with
heat and UV radiation (90 °C oven for 1 h, 200 mJ/cm2 UV). The resulting layer of SU-8 was approximately 10 μm
thick.

Once the immunoassay was executed on the surface of the
chip, the SU-8 resist layer, along with any biological material was
stripped using piranha solution (3:1 sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide,
3–15 min). Some chips were reused (with a fresh coat of SU-8)
until defects were detected. As a medical device these chips are meant
to be single use, so the parameters of reusability were not investigated
further.

Chemicals and Reagents
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
bovine serum albumin (BSA), bicarbonate buffer, rabbit IgG, anti-mouse
rabbit IgG, mouse IgG, rabbit serum, rabbit anti-gp120 antibody, 10
nm gold conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, silver nitrate, citric acid,
trisodium citrate dehydrate, and hydroquinone were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Co., UK. Recombinant HIV gp120 antigen was obtained from Fisher Scientific
UK Ltd.

HIV gp120 antigen solution was prepared using 10 μg/mL
gp120 in bicarbonate buffer. Rabbit IgG solution was prepared using
10 μg/mL rabbit IgG in bicarbonate buffer. 1% BSA blocking buffer
was prepared using PBS. The HIV/RAM test antibody solution was made
up of 100 μg/mL rabbit anti-gp120 and/or anti-mouse rabbit antibody
in PBS and rabbit serum (35–65%). Gold conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG stock solution was diluted 1:50 using 3% BSA solution. Silver
developer solution was prepared fresh before use containing 500 μg/mL
silver nitrate and 17 mg/mL hydroquinone using citrate buffer. Citrate
buffer was prepared containing 2.35% citric acid and 2.55% trisodium
citrate. All solutions were prepared with Millipore water.

Immunoassay
Procedure
The CMOS chip was coated with
10-μm-thick SU-8 photoresist. HIV antigen solution and mouse
IgG solution was spotted on the surface of the chip using polystyrene
inoculation needles (Fisher Scientific Ltd.). The spots were incubated
at room temperature in a sealed, humid container for an hour. The
chip was rinsed with PBS and water, covered with blocking buffer,
and incubated for an hour. The chip was then rinsed and covered with
HIV/RAM test antibody serum solution for 10 min, then rinsed again
and covered with gold conjugated antibody solution for 10 min. After
rinsing, the chip was covered with developer solution and incubated
for 25 min under a dark cover. The resulting structure is illustrated
in Figure 2. Finally,
the chip was rinsed in water, dried, and inserted into the data acquisition
system. A blue LED (VLMB1300-GS08) was used to illuminate the surface
of the chip. The brightness was adjusted to achieve optimal illumination
(PD output 1–2.5 V, different chips needed different brightness).
Each photodiode in the array produced a voltage depending on the amount
of light that reached it.

Conclusion
Two
localized silver staining assays that function essentially
as an ELISA presented in ref (17) were successfully integrated and multiplexed on the surface
of a CMOS sensor array. The advantages of running assays directly
on the surface of a sensor array are manifold. The average of multiple
sensors can be used to reliably evaluate a single assay, and, crucially,
multiple assays can be executed concurrently on the surface of a single
chip. The approach also allows wash steps that increase sensitivity
and specificity when compared to popular paper based lateral flow
immunoassays. This is the first step in creating a mass-manufacturable
hand-held point-of-care (POC) personal diagnostic tool capable of
performing all necessary medical tests in one device.

The results
presented show that the positive HIV assay, as well
as the RAM assay, produce a signal comparable to the positive control.
Furthermore, the assays on top of an SU-8 covered CMOS chip produce
similar signals to those generated using polystyrene plates, the current
gold standard for ELISA assays. The concentration of the HIV antibody
used here is three times lower than reported in typical human infections
(300–500 μg/mL);11 hence,
this assay would be suitable to detect HIV antibodies in human blood.
It is also demonstrated that multiple assays can be performed concurrently
in the same solution without these assays interfering with each other.
Here, we have shown that antibodies specific to HIV gp120 and antibodies
specific to mouse IgG are simultaneously identified. Next we will
extend the array of detected antigens to a range of other pathogens.

Signal strength can also be controlled by varying parameters such
as reagent concentration and development time, and as we scale the
device to include additional pathogen detection immunoassyas, we will
optimize conditions appropriately.

Both a PC-based and a smartphone-based
data acquisition system
were designed and evaluated. The USB OTG connected smartphone app
is excellent for reliably acquiring high-speed data surpassing the
PC based system in both speed and reliability. This proves that the
concept of a complex hand-held diagnostic device is only a few steps
away.
