Immunomodulatory drugs—agents
regulating the immune response—are
commonly used for treating immune system disorders and minimizing
graft versus host disease in persons receiving organ transplants.
At the cellular level, immunosuppressant drugs are used to inhibit
pro-inflammatory or tissue-damaging responses of cells. However, few
studies have so far precisely characterized the cellular-level effect
of immunomodulatory treatment. The primary challenge arises due to
the rapid and transient nature of T-cell immune responses to such
treatment. T-cell responses involve a highly interactive network of
different types of cytokines, which makes precise monitoring of drug-modulated
T-cell response difficult. Here, we present a nanoplasmonic biosensing
approach to quantitatively characterize cytokine secretion behaviors
of T cells with a fine time-resolution (every 10 min) that are altered
by an immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of T-cell-mediated
diseases. With a microfluidic platform integrating antibody-conjugated
gold nanorod (AuNR) arrays, the technique enables simultaneous multi-time-point
measurements of pro-inflammatory (IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α)
and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines secreted by T cells. The integrated
nanoplasmonic biosensors achieve precise measurements with low operating
sample volume (1 μL), short assay time (∼30 min), heightened
sensitivity (∼20–30 pg/mL), and negligible sensor crosstalk.
Data obtained from the multicytokine secretion profiles with high
practicality resulting from all of these sensing capabilities provide
a comprehensive picture of the time-varying cellular functional state
during pharmacologic immunosuppression. The capability to monitor
cellular functional response demonstrated in this study has great
potential to ultimately permit personalized immunomodulatory treatment.

==== Body
T cells are
major cell types
in the recognition and effector mechanisms of the adaptive immune
system.1 A presence of antigenic stimulant
triggers multiple cytokine-mediated intracellular signaling pathways
that drive the proliferation, differentiation, and cytotoxicity activation
of T cells. These T-cell responses are critical in regulating the
protection of the body from pathogenic invasions and cancer development.2,3 However, undesirable pro-inflammatory or tissue-damaging cytotoxic
responses of T cells can cause immune-related disorders, such as allergies,4 autoimmune diseases,5 transplant rejection,6 and graft versus
host disease (GVHD).7 Certain immunosuppressive
therapeutic agents “turn off” T-cell function by blocking
cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory intracellular signaling pathways
by prohibiting cytokine gene expression of the cells.8 But, excessive immunosuppression can be harmful, promoting
opportunistic infections and immune tolerance to cancer development.9 It is highly challenging to precisely maintain
a healthy immune reaction by immunosuppressive modulation therapy
because of the highly dynamic nature of T-cell immune responses.

Profiling the cytokine secretion behaviors of T cells provides
a means to accurately monitor the cellular functional states of the
adaptive immune system. High-precision monitoring of the transient
(and presumably subtle) variations of a cellular functional state
requires continuous measurements of T-cell secretion profiles for
multiple cytokine species. The challenge here is that such cytokine
secretion profiling using conventional processes, which involve cell
culture, cell culture medium supernatant collection, and repeated
sandwich immunoassays for analyte measurement, is time-consuming,
wasteful, and expensive due to the need for a large amount of workload,
samples, consumables, and assay agents. In previous study, Liu et
al.10,11 demonstrated continuous cell-based cytokine
secretion assays using label-free aptamer-based electrode biosensors
integrated with microfluidic cell isolation structures. Their label-free
biosensing approach is perhaps more accurate and convenient than conventional
cell secretion assays by placing cells near the sensing area, which
could minimize the time delay due to analyte diffusion in the measurement
and eliminate the need for sample storage and transfer. However, it
may still fall short of capturing subtle variations and whole information
on cellular immune functions owing to its suboptimal limit of detection
(1–10 ng/mL) and device design prohibiting simultaneous analysis
of more than two analytes.

Our recent study12 has demonstrated
a multiplexed immunoassay that allows rapid, high-sensitivity, high-throughput,
sample-sparing detection of several different cytokines in human serum
using nanoplasmonic biosensor microarrays. This assay involves localized-surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) imaging of biosensors integrated in a microfluidic
platform as a key detection principle.13,14 The LSPR biosensor
structure incorporates arrayed
AuNR particle patterns conjugated with antibodies, in a confined microfluidic
channel, and provides the advantage of biosensor integration.15 Measurements of LSPR image-intensity shifts
resulting from analyte binding to the AuNR particle sensor surfaces
allow for label-free, nanoplasmonic optical measurements of target
biomolecules.16 According to our previous
study,12 this immunoassay exhibits highly
advantageous features, such as a short sampling-to-answer time (∼30
min), which is the time required for the whole process involving analyte
sample loading, incubation, and washing, a large dynamic range (∼10–10 000
pg/mL), a low operating sample volume (∼1 μL), and multiplexed
analysis capability.

Herein, we implemented our nanoplasmonic
multiplexed immunoassay
technique and quantitatively characterized dynamic functional response
of antigen-stimulated Jurkat cells (human leukemic T-cell line) exposed
to an immunosuppressive agent. Our multivariate functional measurements
of Jurkat cells revealed dynamic secretion signatures of the T-cell
immune response as a result of immunosuppressive agent treatments.
Similarly, the cellular functional monitoring capability demonstrated
in this work could be extended to continuous secretion assay by means
of sensor integration in a microfluidic system. This may facilitate
the future development of a nanoplasmonic multiplexed assay-based
diagnostic tool useful for personalized immune regulation treatment.

Results
and Discussion
Jurkat Cell Secretion Assay Sample Preparation
Jurkat
cells, a commonly used human leukemia cell line for characterizing
T-cell receptor signaling pathways,15 were
assayed in a 6-well culture plate (Figure 1a). Briefly, Jurkat cells were activated
by treatments with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Ionomycine
(see Methods) to induce T-cell receptor (TCR)-independent
stimulation responses.17 A supernatant
of 10 μL from each culture well was collected every 60 min and
then loaded into the nanoplasmonic microarray chip for multiplexed
cytokine measurements during the 2 h incubation period after adding
PMA and Ionomycine.

Figure 1 (a) Assay process involving Jurkat T-cell stimulation
and tacrolimus
administration. Prepared Jurkat T cells were activated by PMA and
Ionomycine and incubated for 2 h in a 6-well plate. This was followed
by TAC administration and incubated for 1 h for cytokine secretion
pathway alteration. During the first 2 h incubation period, cell-culture
supernatant samples were collected every 60 min, and samples were
collected every 10 min after dosing TAC to the cells. (b) T-cell intracellular

Collected samples were directly loaded into the chip through the top

patterned antibody-functionalized AuNR particles, was covered with
sample loading channels. (d) Dark-field image of four parallel AuNR
array patterns and SEM image of individual AuNR biosensors immobilized

surfaces. (e) Principle of LSPR dark-field intensity imaging of LSPR
nanoplasmonic biosensor microarrays. The surface binding of a targeted
antigen at the sensing surface causes the sensor image intensity to
increase as a result of both the spectral redshift and intrinsic intensity
enhancement of the AuNR scattering light. Measuring the intensity
change enables us to quantify the amount of the analyte in the sample.

After the 2 h incubation period,
four different concentrations
(0, 0.1, 1, 10 ng/mL) of tacrolimus (TAC) were added into each cell
culture pool (Figure 1a). TAC is a potent immunosuppressive drug widely used to prevent
T-cell induced allograft rejection.18,19Figure 1b illustrates the signaling
mechanism of T cells and how TAC acts on the mechanism. When antigen-presenting
cells co-interact with the TCR and CD28-receptor of T cells, the co-stimulation
triggers activation of calcineurin, which promotes dephosphorylation
of NFAT and its translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus, NFAT
binds AP-1 proteins cooperatively to promote transcription of several
cytokines.20 The introduction of TAC to
activated T cells inhibits the activation of calcineurin through interacting
with FK506 binding proteins, which results in the suppressed cytokine
secretion of the cells. Tracking the levels of cytokines secreted
by T cells therefore provides a functional understanding of how TAC
can effectively alter intracellular signaling events and the resulting
T-cell functional response.

In this study, we designed experiments
to monitor cellular functional
changes of Jurkat cells previously stimulated with PMA and Ionomycine
every 10 min after their exposure to TAC. A previous study by Khalaf
et al.21 showed that the secretion of cytokines
from T cells significantly increases at 2 h after PMA and Ionomycine
stimulation through heightened AP-1 activity. Based on this information
we waited for 2 h after stimulation with PMA and Ionomycine to ensure
that the Jurkat cells were fully activated before the dosing of TAC
and the subsequent monitoring of the Jurkat cells’ immune responses.

LSPR Nanoplasmonic Biosensor Microarray Chip
The LSPR
nanoplasmonic biosensor microarray chip used in this study consists
of two layers: a bottom glass layer and a top polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) layer (Figure 1c). The bottom glass layer contains four meandering strips of antibody-coated
AuNRs, which were deposited by a one-step microfluidic patterning
method.12 The top PDMS layer has ten parallel
microfluidic channels placed orthogonally with respect to the AuNR
strips on the bottom glass layer. This device design yielded 120 sensing
spots in total on a single chip. Each individual channel could hold
a sample volume of 350 nL (200 μm × 35 mm × 50 μm).
Inlet and outlet wells of 0.75 mm in diameter were constructed in
the top PDMS layer for sample loading and washing. Three identical
segments of four co-locating AuNR parallel strips in each microfluidic
channel permitted three measurement repeats for each sample, which
allowed us to obtain statistically meaningful readouts (Figure S1). We successfully functioned each of
the four AuNR strips with an anticytokine antibody targeting against
interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor-necrosis-factor
alpha (TNF-α), or interleukin-10 (IL-10), using the standard
EDC/NHS chemistry (see details in Method; Figure 1d, left panel). It
is known that T cells normally secret these four cytokines upon activation.
We further utilized scanning electron microscopy (Figure 1d, right panel) to verify that
individual, antibody-conjugated AuNRs were uniformly distributed on
the glass substrate with an interparticle distance >100 nm. This
sufficiently
long interparticle distance was critical for avoiding plasmonic coupling
between adjacent particles that could diminish analyte detection sensitivity.12 Simultaneous detection of these four cytokines
could provide predictive information and mechanistic insights for
unraveling the complex and adaptive nature of T-cell immune response
under stimulation and immunemodulation.22−24

The nanoplasmonic
biosensor microarray chip was mounted on a dark-field imaging microscopy
stage for signal detection. When target analytes bound to the antibody-functionalized
AuNRs, the local refractive index change induced a red-shift of the
scattering spectrum of the nanoparticles, which was translated into
an intensity increase of the sensor-pattern image (Figure 1e). The whole AuNR biosensor
microarray image was then captured in real time using an electron
multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) and analyzed by a customized
Matlab code.

Cytokines Standard Curve Acquisition and
Validation with ELISA
Prior to multiplexed analyte detection,
we first performed parallel
calibration for the LSPR biosensors on the microfluidic chip. Standard
curves acquired for each cytokine allowed us to determine the dynamic
range and limit of detection (LOD) of the sensors. To this end, we
spiked a PBS solution with purified IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α,
and IL-10 of known concentrations (from 100 to 2500 pg/mL) and quantified
scattering intensity changes due to the target analyte binding to
the AuNR biosensor microarrays. Here, the concentration range of our
interest is smaller than the dynamic range of the biosensors reported
in our previous study.12Figure 2a shows three sets of AuNR
biosensor images with their intensities increasing with analyte concentrations.
We recorded intensity values of LSPR sensing spots before (I0) and after (I0 + ΔI) sample incubation and plotted standard
curves showing the fractional intensity shift  as a functions of cytokine concentrations
(Figure 2b). We further
determined the limit of detection (LOD) for each cytokine, given by , where σ is the
standard deviation
of the background noise signal amplitude and kslope is the regression slope of each calibration curve. The
LOD for the four cytokines were 31.23 pg/mL, 26.08 pg/mL, 35.40 pg/mL,
and 21.43 pg/mL for IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10, respectively.

Figure 2 (a) Mapping
of intensity variations at LSPR microarray sensing
spots for four different types of cytokines at different concentrations.
(b) Standard curves of purified IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and
IL-10 obtained from LSPR nanoplasmonic biosensor microarray chip.
These curves were obtained from the intensity images in (a). Our device
allows for triplicate measurements for each sample analysis with three
sets of four parallel LSPR sensor stripe patterns integrated within
the same detection microfluidic channel, which minimizes measurement
error.

We further compared readouts from
the LSPR nanoplasmonic biosensor
microarray chip with those of the “gold standard” ELISA
(HumanCytoSet, Invitrogen) (Figure S3a).
PBS solutions spiked with unknown concentrations of cytokines as well
as cell culture supernatant samples containing cytokines secreted
from T cells were prepared before being assayed using the LSPR nanoplasmonic
biosensor platform and ELISA. An excellent correlation (R2 = 0.931) between measurements from the LSPR nanoplasmonic
biosensor assay and ELISA was obtained for samples across a wide dynamic
range. Thus, the accuracy of the LSPR nanoplasmonic biosensor assay
for cytokine secretion measurement was validated with its superior
performance as compared to ELISA (Figure S3).

Dynamic Cytokine Secretion Profile Measurement
Some
researchers have studied the dynamics of T-cell cytokine secretion25 or demonstrated highly multiplexed single-cell
cytokine secretion measurement26 aiming
to understand the T-cell functional response. Access to a technique
allowing multiplexed measurements of dynamic cytokine secretions is
critically important for fully assessing antigen-specific T-cell functional
response.2 Given the intrinsic complexity
of the cytokine network, T-cell functional response assessed by a
single detection parameter is unlikely to reflect the whole picture
of cytokine-mediated cellular functions.27 In addition, cytokine production from antigen-specific T-cell response
can be highly transient27 and dynamic.28 The standard method of gauging immunosuppression
relies only on serially measured drug levels in serum with no functional
assessment of T-cell responses. Therefore, knowledge from multiplexed
time-course measurements of cytokine secretion should be extremely
valuable.

To obtain temporal T-cell cytokine secretion profile,
we collected a series of small-volume supernatant samples from Jurkat
cell culture medium at different time points and sequentially loaded
each of them into a separate microchannel of the LSPR nanoplasmonic
biosensor microarray chip. Secretion curves were plotted for IL-2,
IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10. These curves clearly show activated
and immune suppressed states of Jurkat cells induced by different
concentrations of TAC (Figure 3a–d). The variations across the secretion profiles
of the four target cytokines likely reflect their different functional
roles and secretion mechanisms mediated by different intracellular
signaling pathways as discussed below. The high temporal resolution
of the LSPR nanoplasmonic biosensor microarray chip for cytokine secretion
measurements allowed us to capture transient states of immune suppressed
T cells that occurred within the first 10 min after TAC administration.

Figure 3 Temporal
cytokine secretion profiles of Jurkat T cells for (a)
IL-2, (b) IFN-γ, (c) TNF-α, and (d) IL-10 during two serial
incubation periods: (1) 2 h after PMA and Ionomycin stimulation and
(2) 1 h after TAC administration. The label of “Con”
represents data from TAC-free control measurement in the second incubation
period with the PMA/Inomycin stimulated cells. The labels of “T0.1”,
“T1”, and “T10” represent data from the
second incubation period after dosing TAC at the concentrations of
0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL, respectively. The schematics in (e) and (d)
show AP-1-mediated T-cell secretion pathways of IL-2 and IL-10, respectively.

It is well-known that T cells
activated by antigen stimulation
secrete cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ, via an NFAT-mediated
regulatory pathway (Figure 1b).20,29 The presence of TAC blocks NFAT
dephosphorylation due to intracellular calcineurin inhibition, which
hinders the transcription and secretion of NFAT-dependent cytokines
by T cells.30 Our results show that IL-2
and IFN-γ secretions from Jurkat cells were suppressed under
the high TAC-dose levels (Figure 3a,b). Moreover, IL-2 concentration reached a plateau
around 50 min after TAC administration at concentrations of 1 and
10 ng/mL (Figure 3a).
The plateau of cytokine secretion profile indicates the completion
of IL-2 secretion inhibition for Jurkat cells.

Activated Jurkat
cells with no TAC dosing (Figure 3a, control) showed a sharp elevation of IL-2
secretion at 2 h after PMA and Ionomysin stimulation. This abrupt
secretion elevation could be attributed to the onset of AP-1 protein
activation accompanying NFAT in the T-cell nucleus, forming stable
DNA binding sites to initiate transcriptional processes for cytokine
secretion (Figure 3e).20 Previous research has revealed that
AP-1 activation in T cells upon exposure to PMA is a delayed process
that arises around 2 h after stimulation.21,31 AP-1 activation leads to an elevated inflammatory response with
heightened cellular secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
IL-2, IL-6, CXCL8, TNF-α, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine,
IL-10.21 This is consistent with our control
data for IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-10. Furthermore, there are research
reports suggesting that AP-1 activity does not affect IFN-γ
expression, which is again similar to our observation of no leap of
IFN-γ secretion from Jurkat cells.32

TAC also inhibits the transcription of NF- κB in the
T-cell
nucleus and regulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.19 TNF-α is a NF-κB dependent cytokine19,31 and a good indicator of the inflammation suppression effect of TAC
on the immune system. Figure 3c shows that TNF-α secretion under the doses of TAC
(T0.1, T1, T10) exhibited different profiles than the control. There
were notable deviations in TNF-α secretion from control at 20
min after dosing 0.1 and 1 ng/mL of TAC, whereas TNF-α secretion
suppression already started within 10 min of treatment with the 10
ng/mL TAC.

IL-10 is known to counter-regulate and inhibit T-cell
activation
and proliferation by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-5, and IFN-γ.33−35 Interestingly,
after its immediate secretion shutdown upon TAC treatments, IL-10
secretion gradually recovered after 10, 20, and 30 min exposure with
TAC doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL, respectively. This unique secretion
pattern of IL-10 might be attributed to a feedback reaction of IL-10
production to pro-inflammatory cytokines that were already secreted
by Jurkat cells.21,36 The presence of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in the cell culture at significant concentrations likely
continued to promote production of IL-10 even after the TAC-induced
secretion suppression took place.

We further verified that cell
death was not responsible for deceased
levels of cytokine secretions. To this end, we performed viability
tests on Jurkat cells treated with stimulants and TAC (Figure S5). Across all four conditions (Con,
TAC 0.1, 1, 10 ng/mL), only 3.05–4.25% of Jurkat cells lost
viability, suggesting a negligible effect of cell death on our assays.

Transient Variations of Cytokine Secretion Rate
We
extracted the cytokine secretion rate (pg/min) from the slope of the
line connecting the two subsequent data points in each 10 min interval
of the secretion curves in Figure 3 and plotted secretion rate variations over time for
all the four target cytokines (Figure 4). The temporal variation of the cytokine secretion
rate provides information useful for understanding the interplay between
proinflammatory cytokines and T-cell functional response after TAC
administration. As expected, the transient evolutions of the rapidly
changing cytokine-release behavior of the Jurkat T cells exhibit both
drug dose- and time-dependent characteristics.

Figure 4 Time-course cytokine
secret rate variations of Jurkat T cells for
(a) IL-2, (b) IFN-γ, (c) TNF-α, and (d) IL-10 during the
1 h incubation period after TAC administration. At the time point
at t = 120 min is the point at which the TAC administration
takes place. The labels of “Con”, “T0.1”,
“T1”, and “T10” represent the same conditions
as in Figure 3.

The data show an immediate reduction
of the IL-2 secretion rate
after the peak value at 10 and 30 min after dosing TAC of 1 and 10
ng/mL, respectively (Figure 4a). In contrast, the 0.1 ng/mL dose did not completely stop
the IL-2 cytokine secretion throughout the 60 min observation period,
as indicated by the monotonically increasing secretion-rate curve.
A similar reduction of the secretion rate was observed for IFN-γ
as well upon TAC administration. The values of the IFN-γ secretion
rate converged to a small value near the end of the assay regardless
of the TAC concentrations (Figure 4b), which were derived from the near-end plateaus of
all the original IFN-γ secretion-profile curves (Figure 3b). The TNF-α secretion
rate experienced gradual variations over 60 min for the three different
TAC-dose levels. The rate eventually reached a near-zero value for
all the TAC-dose levels while the control experiment resulted in a
nearly monotonically increasing curve. The TAC dose of 10 ng/mL was
especially inhibitive and immediately ceased the TNF-α secretion,
and the secretion rate became nearly zero within the first 10 min.
Such information may have important implications for the dose effect
of TAC on various immune functions.

The data for IL-10 show
an intriguing secretion characteristic
with a distinct reheightened secretion rate during the 60 min period
(Figure 4d). The initially
depressed secretion rate of IL-10 might be a result of the combined
contributions from both the drug exposure and the lowered pro-inflammatory
cytokine expression in that time frame. The subsequent increase in
the IL-10 secretion rate likely reflects a delayed anti-inflammatory
feedback response of the cells to the peaked secretion of IL-2 and
IFN-γ found in the early stage of the post-TAC administration
period. Such IL-10 secretion dynamics could be explained by the IL-10-mediated
autocrine regulation of T-cell functions.37

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated the use of
LSPR nanoplasmonic biosensor
microarrays for obtaining temporal cytokine secretion profiles of
T cells under immunosuppressive modulation. Our cytokine secretion
assay was rapid, sensitive, and easy to implement for multiplexed,
multi-time-point detection. The multiplexed time-course cytokine secretion
data obtained from this work enabled us to characterize dynamic features
of the functional response of Jurkat T cells after their exposure
to an immunosuppressant. The rapid reaction of T cells clearly reflected
the agent’s effect in quickly altering cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory
intracellular signaling pathways. To the best of our knowledge, this
study is the first to quantitatively characterize dynamic cytokine
secretion behaviors under immunosuppressive modulation.

The
T-cell functional response is governed by an orchestration
of dynamic secretions of multiple cytokine species. Of particular
importance in the current study is the demonstrated ability of our
method to probe the temporal secretion profiles of four target cytokines
(IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10) from T cells. The multianalyte,
multi-time-point detection provides a unique opportunity to obtain
a broad picture of cellular functional states rapidly modulated by
immunosuppressive agents. Variations in the degree and timing of the
TAC-induced secretion suppression across these cytokines under a given
drug administration condition offer clinically relevant insight, which
may serve to develop a more precise way of modulating immune responses
beyond the historically standard practice of monitoring serum drug
levels. For example, by monitoring both IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion
profiles under various TAC doses, we may be able to quickly (<60
min) estimate a minimum amount of TAC required to inhibit the IL-2-mediated
inflammatory response of T cells without breaking down IFN-γ
mediated antiviral responses. This could prevent overdosing of the
immunosuppressant, which could induce adverse effects and diseases
due to oversuppressed innate immunity. In addition, our study suggests
that comparing the secretion profile of IL-10 to those of IL-2 and
IFN-γ may provide critical information about the T cell’s
real-time feedback control of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion
via autocrine/paracrine secretion signaling pathways.

The cellular
functional monitoring capability demonstrated by the
LSPR nanoplasmonic biosensor microarrays may serve to guide precise
and personalized real-time immune regulation treatments. With this
capability, one may precisely assess temporal variations of the functional
behaviors of T cells for a given immunosuppressive agent delivery
condition. We envision that our nanoplasmonic biosensing platform
will be used as a drug efficacy-screening tool for future personalized
medicine while indicating the immunomodulatory effect of a given agent
on the functional behaviors of immune cells.

Materials and Methods
Microfludic
Channel Fabrication
Molds for constructing
the PDMS microfluidic structures were fabricated on a silicon wafer
using photolithography-based micromachining techniques followed by
deep reactive ion-etching (Pegasus 4, SPTS Technologie Ltd., Allentown,
PA, USA). The silicon molds were silanized with (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane
vapor (United Chemical Technologies) for 1 h under vacuum to facilitate
subsequent release of PDMS from the molds. A PDMS precursor (Sylgard-184,
Dow Corning) was prepared by mixing a PDMS curing agent with the PDMS
base (wt:wt = 1:10), poured onto the silicon molds, and cured overnight
in a 60 °C oven. Two separate fully cured PDMS structures with
microfluidic channels were fabricated using different molds: one for
patterning the arrayed AuNRs biosensor stripes on a glass substrate
and the other for forming the analyte detection layer of the LSPR
biosensor microarray chip.

LSPR Nanoplasmonic Biosensor Microarray Fabrication
A piranha-cleaned glass substrate was first oxygen-plasma treated
at 20 W for 120 s. Then, a colloidal solution suspending positively
charged CTAB-coated AuNRs (Nanoseedz, Hong Kong) were flown into PDMS
microfluidic patterning channels covered by the plasma treated glass
substrate. The surface of the glass substrate was negatively charged.
The AuNRs were immobilized onto the glass substrate by means of electrostatic
interactions and formed bar-shaped parallel sensor array patters.
Subsequently, 1 mM of 10-carboxy-1-decanethiol (C10) (Dojindo, Japan)
was dissolved in 10% ethanol, loaded into the microfluidic patterning
channels, and incubated overnight to functionalize the AuNR surfaces
with C10, which replaced CTAB through a ligand exchange process. 0.4
M EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride,
Thermo Scientific) and 0.1 M NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide,
Thermo Scientific) were mixed at a 1:1 volume ratio in 0.1 M MES (1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]
carbodiimide hydrochloride, Thermo Scientific) solution. 10 μL
of the EDC/NHS/MES solution was loaded to the same microfluidic channels
and incubated for 20 min to activate the ligand. This was followed
by antibody coating of the AuNR sensor patters that involved loading
of probe antibodies (antihuman IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10,
ebioscience, USA) in deionized water at a concentration of 50 μg/mL
into individual patterning channels. Subsequently, 1% BSA in deionized
water solution was loaded through the channels and incubated for 20
min for sensor surface passivation to eliminate nonspecific binding
of biomolecules. At the end of every incubation step above, the sensor
surfaces were thoroughly washed using deionized water, and any excessive
solution and unbound molecules were removed.

Jurkat Cell Culture Reagents
Jurkat cells (CRL-2901,
ATCC) were cultured in RPMI (RPMI-1640, ATCC) growth medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (30–2020, ATCC). Cells were incubated
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity in a CO2 Cell Culture Incubator (Thermo Scientific). The culture medium
was replaced every 2–3 days. The cells were collected by centrifugation
at a speed of 1200g for 5 min and suspended in culture
medium for the assays in this study.

Cell Secretion Assay Protocol
A cell culture medium
of 2 mL suspending Jurkat cells at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/mL was loaded to one of the wells of a 6-well plate.
A mixture of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 ng/mL and Ionomycine (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 1000 ng/mL dissolved in deionized water was added into the prepared
cells to activate them to secrete cytokines. Subsequently, these cells
were incubated for 2 h. A supernatant of 10 μL was collected
from the cell culture medium in the cell pool of the 6-well plate.
This supernatant volume is less than 1% of the total cell culture
medium volume, which allowed us to minimize the concentration changes
resulting from collecting the supernatants. 6 μL out of the
10 μL supernatant collected was directly loaded into the LSPR
biosensor microarray chip for cytokine quantification. After a 120
min incubation process, the immunosuppressant, TAC (Sigma-Aldrich),
was added into the cell pool at a concentration of 0, 0.1, 1, or 10
ng/mL and incubated for 60 min. The supernatant sample was repeatedly
collected from each cell pool every 60 min after the PMA/Ionomycin
stimulation and every 10 min after the TAC administration. To fully
expose the cells to the stimulant and TAC and to collect a sample
from a uniformly mixed cell culture medium, the 6-well plate was manually
shaken every time before collecting the supernatant. A syringe infusion
pump was used to load the sample to the chip at an infusion rate of
2 μL/min for 3 min. Each sample loaded to the chip was incubated
for 30 min and washed with PBS. The 30 min incubation time was determined
from real-time binding measurements for the four different analyte
types of various concentrations. We found that the analyte-binding
event typically reached an equilibrium state within 30 min after the
sample loading (Figure S4).

Cell Viability
Test
Cells stimulated and incubated
with TAC were collected and stained with 10% of trypan blue (302643,
Sigma-Aldrich) v/v in PRMI solution and immediately examined under
a microscope for cell viability test. It was observed under the transmission
mode of the microscope that dead cells were stained with dye and colored
blue while healthy cells remained uncolored.

LSPR Microarray Chip-to-Chip
Variance Characterization
Signal consistency was validated
across different LSPR microarray
chip devices. To this end, cytokine samples of known concentrations
were loaded to two out of ten sample-detection microfluidic channels
of each chip and measured their signal intensities. The coefficient
of variance (CV, defined as the ratio of standard deviation to the
mean signal intensity value) of the signals was calculated to be 8.49%
across 15 chips after loading the background buffer PBS. This small
chip-to-chip sensor performance variance (CV < 10%) reveals the
reproducibility and stability of our LSPR microarray assay, which
minimizes errors that would result from using different chips for
cell secretion measurements.

LSPR Dark-Field Imaging Protocol
The fabricated and
prepared LSPR biosensor microarray chip was mounted on a motorized
stage (ProScan, Prior Scientific) to position the on-chip sensing
spot at ease and to automate the signal scanning. A dark-field condenser
(NA = 1.45, MBL12000, Nikon) was closely placed to the backside of
the glass substrate (the opposite side of the AuNR-deposited sensor
side) using lens oil. The light scattered from the AuNR nanoplasmonic
biosensor arrays was collected using a 10× objective lens under
the chip and then filtered by a band-pass filter (674–686 nm,
Semrock). This light signal was collected by an electron-multiplying
CCD (EMCCD, Photometrics) camera and analyzed using NIS-Elecment BR
analysis software. Further analysis was performed using our customized
Matlab code.
