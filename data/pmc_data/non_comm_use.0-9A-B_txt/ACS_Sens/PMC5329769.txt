Efficiently detecting
DNA sequences within a limited time is vital
for disease screening and public health monitoring. This calls for
a new method that combines high sensitivity, fast read-out time, and
easy manipulation of the sample, avoiding the extensive steps of DNA
amplification, purification, or grafting to a surface. Here, we introduce
photon cross-correlation spectroscopy as a new method for specific
DNA sensing with high sensitivity in a single-step homogeneous solution
phase. Our approach is based on confocal dual-color illumination and
detection of the scattering intensities from individual silver nanoparticles
and gold nanorods. In the absence of the target DNA, the nanoparticles
move independently and their respective scattering signals are uncorrelated.
In the presence of the target DNA, the probe-functionalized gold and
silver nanoparticles assemble via DNA hybridization with the target,
giving rise to temporal coincidence between the signals scattered
by each nanoparticle. The degree of coincidence accurately quantifies
the amount of target DNA. To demonstrate the efficiency of our technique,
we detect a specific DNA sequence of sesame, an allergenic food ingredient,
for a range of concentration from 5 pM to 1.5 nM with a limit of detection
of 1 pM. Our method is sensitive and specific enough to detect single
nucleotide deletion and mismatch. With the dual-color scattering signals
being much brighter than fluorescence-based analogs, the analysis
is fast, quantitative, and simple to operate, making it valuable for
biosensing applications.

Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)
has made a significant stride for DNA sensing in bioanalysis and molecular
biology.1,2 However, due to the several steps involved
in the process, PCR is time-consuming and requires experienced personnel.3,4 Fluorescence-based devices5−7 (microarrays and molecular beacons)
offer an alternative method to reach quantitative DNA detection, down
to the single molecule level, and without the need for PCR amplification.
Unfortunately, single molecule fluorescence-based techniques are limited
by the weak signals and the poor photostability of typical fluorescent
dyes. Fluorescent microbeads provide one approach to obtain an intense
fluorescence signal, and are particularly relevant when the microbeads
are color-coded and combined to a flow cytometry device for multiplexed
detection as in Luminex assays.8 However,
meeting the needs of future point-of-care biosensors still requires
further simplification in the assay format, sample manipulation, and
optical signal analysis.9

Noble metal
nanoparticles (NPs) are another approach to obtain
an intense optical signal thanks to their large absorption and scattering
cross sections. Typically, the scattered intensity from a single metal
NP can be 106 times higher than a bright fluorescent dye,10−13 and still feature a perfect photostability. Metal NPs have thus
attracted much attention for molecular biosensing, leading to DNA
colorimetric assays that are detectable with the naked eye, although
with a limited 10 nM sensitivity.14−16 Their ease of use involving
a single mixing step makes them especially attractive.17−21 As another technique using metal NPs, local surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) monitors the spectral shift induced on the scattering or absorption
spectrum induced by the presence of the analyte.22,23 However, the sensitivity and applicability of LSPR are limited by
the small spectral shifts respective to the broad width of the plasmon
resonance peaks. Recently, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and two
photon photoluminescence (TPPL) have been introduced as detection
techniques for NP-based DNA assays.24−26 In DLS, the presence
of target DNA is revealed by an increase in the apparent average size
of the nanoparticles.24,27−30 In TPPL, the target DNA reduces
the distance between nanoparticles, increasing the plasmon coupling
strength and enhancing the TPPL signal.26 Colorimetric, LSPR, DLS, and TPPL take advantage of the bright optical
response of metal NP to detect DNA in a simple single-step workflow.
However, all these techniques are based on ensemble averaging over
a large number of nanoparticles and depend on the distance and the
plasmon coupling between nanoparticles. To improve the sensitivity
toward the picomolar regime and increase the detection speed, a flow
cytometry approach interrogating each NP individually would be a preferable
alternative to detect scarce NP aggregates and avoid ensemble averaging.

Here, we introduce a novel technique for one-step detection of
specific DNA sequences in homogeneous solution. Our approach is based
on detecting the light intensity scattered by individual metal NP
aggregates at two different wavelengths; we therefore call it photon
cross-correlation spectroscopy (PhoCCS). Our results achieve a sensitivity
of 1 pM without any DNA amplification by PCR, the detection is specific
to a single nucleotide mismatch or deletion, and only a single mixing
step is required in the process to put together the solution containing
the DNA target and the NPs.

Our approach is schematically represented
in Figure 1. The detection
of DNA relies on the self-assembly
of two distinct scattering NPs (silver nanoparticles AgNPs and gold
nanorods AuNRs) mediated via specific based pair recognition between
single strand ss-DNA target and ss-DNA probes anchored to the NPs
surfaces. Two focused laser beams with distinct wavelengths illuminate
the sample solution containing the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles
have been carefully chosen so that each nanoparticle probe predominantly
scatters lights at its respective wavelength. The scattered signal
for each wavelength is measured by a photodetector after passing through
a confocal pinhole to filter the off-focus scattered light. This dual-color
confocal configuration allows monitoring the temporal evolution of
the scattering intensities stemming from individual nanoparticles
and their aggregates within a small 5 fL probe volume. In the absence
of target, the NPs are moving independently and thus their respective
scattering signals are uncorrelated on the two detectors. Upon addition
of target DNA, AgNPs and AuNRs will become linked to each other, forming
an aggregate.24 Therefore, AgNPs and AuNRs
will diffuse simultaneously across the analysis volume, giving rise
to temporal coincidences between the scattered signals. The level
of correlation between channels then allows specific quantification
of the amount of target DNA.

Figure 1 Principle of dual-color photon cross-correlation
spectroscopy:
the sample containing the probe metal nanoparticles is illuminated
by two lasers at different wavelengths (blue and red). The resulting
scattering signal is collected for both colors and compared to detect
temporal coincidences between the detection channels. In the presence
of the target DNA, nanoparticle probes A and B associate, yielding
temporal coincidence between the detection channels as individual
nanoparticle-DNA constructs are sampled across the femtoliter detection
volume.

We demonstrate the efficiency
of PhoCCS by detecting a specific
DNA sequence of sesame, an allergenic food ingredient, for a range
of concentration from 5 pM to 1.5 nM with a limit of detection of
1 pM and a specificity to single nucleotide deletion or mismatch.
Food allergies are considered by the WHO among the five most important
public health concerns,31 and sesame (Sesamum indicum) allergens have been associated with
particularly severe reactions with a high risk of anaphylaxis.32 The use of DNA markers to detect the presence
of allergenic ingredients in food is advantageous due to their higher
thermal stability and lower susceptibility to seasonal and geographical
impacts than proteins.33,34

Materials
and Methods
Metal Nanoparticles
Silver nanoparticles and gold nanorods
have been selected,12 and their synthesis
is described in the Supporting Information. The silver nanoparticles AgNPs have a spherical shape with a diameter
of 44 nm ± 5 nm, while the gold nanorods AuNRs have an average
length of 47 nm ± 4 nm and an aspect ratio of 2.2 (Figures 2A and S1). The scattering spectra for pure solutions of each NP
show that AgNPs scatter predominantly blue light (λmax = 430 nm), while AuNRs scatter red light (λmax =
630 nm) with negligible crosstalk between the 488 and 633 nm detection
channels (Figure 2B).
The aspect ratio for the gold nanorods is chosen so as to maximize
the response at 633 nm while minimizing the cross-talk at 488 nm.
The UV–visible extinction spectra confirm that the synthesized
NPs are well-dispersed with a plasmon band around 430 nm for AgNPs
and a longitudinal plasmon band located at 630 nm for AuNRs (Figure S2).

(B) Scattering spectra of AgNPs (blue) and AuNRs (red) showing the
local surface plasmon resonance. The 488 and 633 nm illumination and
detection channels are also represented and are optimized to minimize
cross-talk between channels. (C) Intensity time traces recorded for
both detection channels on a solution containing only AgNPs (left)
or AuNRs (right). The temporal coincidence K is strictly
zero in this case after burst threshold detection has been applied.
The horizontal dashed lines correspond to threshold of 80 counts per
ms to remove the background noise and the small crosstalk between
channels.

Nanoparticle Modification
with DNA
Thiol-functionalized
single-stranded oligonucleotides (probe A and probe B, 100 nmol) were
reduced in 0.3 mL of 100 mM dithiolthreitol (DTT) solution in 10 mM
of phosphate buffer (PB) (pH = 7.4), followed by 30 min incubation.
The samples then were loaded onto a freshly purified sephadex column
(NAP-5, GE Healthcare), and eluted with 2.5 mL 10 mM PB. The DNA was
quantified by UV–vis spectrometry. The synthesized nanoparticles
were functionalized with DNA. For each sample, an excess of 3000 purified
DNA per nanoparticles was added to 1 mL of a purified water solution
of nanoparticles (∼2 nM), and the mixture incubated in an unbuffered
solution for at least 12 h. Then, 0.1% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate
and 10 mM concentration of PB were added to the mixtures, and left
for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the salt concentration was
stepwise increased to 0.01 M of NaCl, and the samples were incubated
overnight. The solutions were freed of excess DNA by two consecutive
centrifugations at 7000 rpm for 15 min and supernatant exchange. The
DNA-NPs were well dispersed in 10 mM of phosphate buffer, pH = 7.4,
and 0.1 M NaCl, and remained stable for at least one month. Before
the DNA detection method, the salt concentration of both solutions
was increased up to 0.5 M NaCl.

Detection Assay
DNA detection was carried out at by
adding 0.09 nM of each probe solution and different target DNA concentrations
from 0.005 to 1.5 nM in a final volume of 100 μL of buffer containing
10 mM phosphate buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, pH = 7.4. All the hybridization
assays were performed after 5 min heating at 95 °C followed by
30 min of incubation at 65 °C (a discussion about the effect
of temperature and incubation time is presented in the Supporting Information Figure S3). A 10 μL
drop was deposited on the surface of a glass substrate for analysis.
Three separate experiments were performed for each concentration (n = 3).

Optical Setup
Two-color illumination
is obtained by
combining the 488 nm laser beam of a Sapphire 488LP (Coherent) with
the 633 nm beam of a helium–neon laser (Melles Griot 25LHP991)
using broadband 50/50 cube beamsplitters (Figure S4). The beams are focused by a 16×/NA 0.5 objective (Zeiss
Plan Neofluar) into the 10 μL droplet containing the sample.
The scattered light is collected by the same objective and focused
on 20 μm confocal pinholes optically conjugated to the focus
spot. The detection on each channel is performed by two avalanche
photodiodes (PerkinElmer SPCM-AQR-13) after a 10 nm bandpass filter
centered on the laser line (Thorlabs). The time trace is recorded
with a ALV6000 acquisition card (ALV GmbH) with 40 ms binning time.
The laser powers are set to get comparable signals on each channel;
we use 200 nW at 488 nm and 700 nW at 633 nm.

Coincidence Analysis
We define the coincidence parameter K as the ratio
of the total number of simultaneous detection
events on both channels to the total number of detection events (falling
on either detector). As K is a ratio of the number
of binary detection events, it is independent of the detected intensity
and the size of the aggregate. With this definition, K is always between 0 and 1, and will be 1 for perfectly correlated
signals and 0 for totally uncorrelated. The coincidence coefficient K is measured over a 200 s trace duration. We consider only
the counts above about a threshold of 80 counts per ms to remove the
background noise and the small crosstalk between channels.

Results
and Discussion
DNA Detection Assay
The concentration
of NPs is set
to 90 pM as evaluated by UV–visible spectrometry,35 to ensure that about 0.2 NPs are present in
the detection volume on average. With this low number of particles
inside the sampling volume, the scattering signal from individual
NPs can be monitored as they cross the observation volume, giving
rise to temporal bursts in the scattered intensity (Figure 2C). These traces again confirm
that AgNPs respond predominantly in the blue detection channel, while
AuNRs respond in the red channel. Importantly, the nearly negligible
crosstalk (scattering of AgNPs into red channel and scattering of
AuNRs into blue channel) can be totally suppressed after applying
a threshold for burst detection, so that strictly no coincidence between
channels is found for pure (AgNPs or AuNRs) samples.

To validate
the DNA detection assay, we focus on the detection of a specific fragment
of sesame, an allergenic food ingredient. The sequences of the 68-mer
ss-DNA target and 30-mer ssDNA probes are given in the Supporting Information Table S1.

Figure 3 shows representative
intensity time traces recorded on both detection channels for a mixture
of AgNPs and AuNRs, respectively, with no target (control), 0.1 nM
and 1 nM of target. In the absence of target (control), the detected
signals are only weakly correlated, with a residual coincidence parameter K = (9.7 ± 0.2) × 10–2 stemming
from the spurious simultaneous presence of AgNPs and AuNRs in the
confocal detection volume. The presence of the target allows the assembly
of AgNPs and AuNRs through 25 base pairs hybridization between the
recognition part of the probes and the target. The signals become
correlated and the coincidence parameter K significantly
increases above the background level. The assembly between AgNPs and
AuNRs upon mixing with target DNA is confirmed by three different
independent methods, using scattering spectroscopy (Figure S5), scanning electron microscopy (Figure S6), and temporal cross-correlation analysis (Figure S7). The signal loss when the temperature
for DNA hybridization is elevated above 75 °C is another additional
confirmation (Figure S3A).

Figure 3 Representative intensity
time traces and coincidence parameter
K on AgNPs–AuNRs mixtures for three different concentrations
of DNA target. The full trace duration is 200 s. Black dashed lines
represent the threshold of 80 counts per ms to remove the background
noise and the small crosstalk between channels. Only detection events
above this level are considered in the computation of the coincidence
parameter.

To quantify the amount of sesame
DNA from the measured coincidence
parameter, we perform a series of experiments with different known
concentrations of target DNA from 5 pM to 1.5 nM (Figure 4). The measurements are taken
after DNA hybridization at 65 °C for 30 min, which appeared to
be optimum in our case (Figure S3). The
temporal coincidence increased gradually with the DNA concentration
(Figure 4A), empirically
following a power law with 0.4 exponent in this concentration range.
The limit of detection (LOD) is estimated by the intercept between
this curve and the background level K = 0.097 plus
three times the 0.002 standard deviation estimated from n = 11 separated experiments (dashed gray line in Figure 4B).36 We obtain a LOD of 1 pM for this work, and many parameters (NPs
concentration, integration time) can be further optimized to reduce
the LOD.

Figure 4 (A) Evolution of the measured coincidence parameter K (red dots) as a function of the target DNA concentration. All results
are expressed as average ± standard deviation of 3 separated
experiments (n = 3). (B) Determination of the limit
of detection. The solid gray line indicates the level for the mean
coincidence K in the absence of target DNA (K = 0.097), and the dashed line corresponds to this level
plus 3 times the standard deviation (3 × 0.002 from n = 11 separated experiments).

Specificity of the DNA Detection
To examine the selectivity
of the PhoCCS assay, we perform experiments using base-pairing defects
targeting DNA:single base mismatches, single base deletions, and noncomplementary
DNA sequences. Each single defect (mismatch and deletion) is located
at the center of the specific recognition part of the target with
probe A. The sequences of the targets are summarized in Table S2. 100 pM DNA is analyzed under the same
conditions as above. Figure 5 compares the coincidence parameter K for
each defect sequence with the results obtained for the control (no
target) and for perfectly matched DNA. Without adding any supplementary
preparation step, our data already show a clear decrease of the temporal
coincidence when a single base defect is considered. The significant
8-fold drop of the standard deviation demonstrates the capability
to detect single base mismatch or single base deletion. Additionally,
noncomplementary DNA strands lead to K values similar
to the control, since no hybridization to the probes occurred.

Figure 5 Selectivity
of the assay to single nucleotide mismatch or deletion:
coincidence parameter K found for 100 pM of target
with perfectly matched DNA target (sesame), with a single defect in
the sesame sequence (one mismatched base, one deleted base) and with
the noncomplementary part. The full sequences are given in Table S2. All results are expressed as average
± standard deviation of 3 separate experiments (n = 3).

As metal nanoparticles are used
as scatterers, the optical signal
in PhoCCS is bright and perfectly photostable, as opposed to fluorescence.
Moreover, as we rely on coincidence events above a detection threshold,
our approach is independent of the scattering intensity and the distance
and orientation between nanoparticles. PhoCCS bears some conceptual
similarity with fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS),37−39 but with a much brighter and photostable signal enabling to improve
both the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensitivity. The read-out is
fast and can be done in a few seconds. Our detection is based only
on the individual scattering responses of the NPs, and we have checked
that the weak plasmonic coupling between the nanoparticles to shift
the resonance has a negligible influence on our detection process
(Figure S5). This is a strength of our
method over LSPR or TPPL techniques as the readout is independent
of the distance between nanoparticles. Additionally, the scattering
spectra in Figure S5 show that the LOD
for LSPR sensing using our constructs would be in the hundreds of
picomolar.

The use of two distinct color channels for illumination
and detection
and the confocal detection volume allows one to efficiently discriminate
detection events to reach picomolar sensitivities even in the presence
of a large number of nonaggregated NPs as an improvement over conventional
DLS approach.24,29 Moreover, as we screen for the
occurrence of temporal coincidence between bursts above a certain
intensity threshold, our approach is not affected by the absolute
scattered intensity and can accommodate a comparatively higher background
and tolerance for size and shape dispersion among the nanoparticles.

Importantly, the whole assay is performed in a single mixing step
in solution phase. It does not require any washing or purification
cycle. The readout can be performed immediately after DNA hybridization
without further processing. Moreover, the hybridization is more efficient
in the solution phase than on a planar surface. In addition, our approach
works with very small sample volumes (10 μL used here). Much
lower volumes can be used as the system is straightforward to integrate
with microfluidic channels. This is a key advantage allowing reduction
of the consumption of reagents and sample, which is highly valuable
in the case of low and rare sample amounts. The detection can also
be performed while a flux is applied to the solution so as to speed
up the diffusion of the probes and accelerate the measurement acquisition
time.

Conclusion
We have introduced a novel dual-color technique
for one-step detection
of specific DNA sequences in homogeneous assay, with a sensitivity
of 1 pM and specificity to single nucleotide defects. The analysis
of the light scattered by the solution is fast, quantitative, and
simple to operate, making it valuable for bioapplications. The technique
is straightforward to integrate toward point-of-care biosensors, and
shows promising prospects for quantitative DNA detection and single
nucleotide polymorphism analysis without requiring DNA amplification.
