An
aptamer reagent that can switch its binding affinity in a pH-responsive
manner would be highly valuable for many biomedical applications including
imaging and drug delivery. Unfortunately, the discovery of such aptamers
is difficult and only a few have been reported to date. Here we report
the first experimental strategy for generating pH-responsive aptamers
through direct selection. As an exemplar, we report streptavidin-binding
aptamers that retain nanomolar affinity at pH 7.4 but exhibit a ∼100-fold
decrease in affinity at pH 5.2. These aptamers were generated by incorporating
a known streptavidin-binding DNA motif into an aptamer library and
performing FACS-based screening at multiple pH conditions. Upon structural
analysis, we found that one aptamer’s affinity-switching behavior
is driven by a noncanonical G-A base-pair that controls its folding
in a highly pH-dependent manner. We believe our strategy could be
readily extended to other aptamer-target systems because it does not
require a priori structural knowledge of the aptamer or the target.

pH is carefully regulated,
as it plays an essential role in many critical functions including
energy generation and maintenance of protein structure and function.1−3 Additionally, differences in pH help to control the binding and
release of important biomolecules by pH-regulated receptors. One critical
example is hemoglobin, which exhibits reduced affinity for oxygen
as pH decreases.4 This promotes uptake
of oxygen in the lungs, where the pH is higher, and the subsequent
release of oxygen into muscle tissue, where the pH is lower. Reagents
that exploit these pH differences for controlled activation or release
have proven valuable for many biotechnology applications, most notably
in the areas of drug delivery and imaging.5−8 For example, several groups have
described pH-sensitive DNA nanostructures9 that can perform a wide array of molecular functions, such as sequestering
a drug in an inactive state until reaching a cellular compartment
with a permissive pH environment, or intracellular imaging to measure
pH gradients within cells.7,10−14

Aptamers are a widely used class of affinity reagents, and
several
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of introducing a diverse
range of specialized functionalities into aptamers.15,16 In the context of molecular detection or controlled drug release,
it would be especially advantageous to have aptamers for which the
affinity is modulated by environmental pH, but only a small number
of pH-sensitive aptamers have been reported to date.17,18 These were produced by engineering known pH-responsive motifs into
existing aptamers. For example, the Ricci group designed a cocaine-binding
aptamer that incorporates a pH-dependent triplex and were able to
modulate the affinity of the aptamer for cocaine through pH changes.17 The DeRosa group added a polyadenine tail to
a thrombin-binding aptamer and found that G-A mismatches formed at
acidic pH, disrupting the aptamer’s G-quadruplex structure
and releasing bound thrombin.18 This design
method has yielded some useful pH-sensitive aptamers but is somewhat
limited because it requires a priori knowledge regarding the structure
of active binding motifs within existing aptamers in order to guide
the incorporation of pH-responsive elements. Furthermore, this approach
is constrained by access to a limited range of known pH-sensitive
motifs, which may not necessarily perform optimally—or may
even impede binding function—after incorporation into a given
aptamer sequence.

In an effort to overcome these limitations,
we have devised a strategy
that enables the direct selection of aptamers that exhibit both excellent
target binding and sensitive pH response. To achieve this, we adapted
the particle display platform previously developed by our group, in
which nucleic acid libraries are converted into monoclonal aptamer
particles19,20 that can be rapidly and quantitatively screened
using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). We have designed
a selection procedure that enables us to isolate aptamers that exhibit
different target affinities at pH 7.4 compared to pH 5.2, which we
demonstrate by generating pH-sensitive aptamers for streptavidin.
After only three rounds of screening, we generated an aptamer whose
affinity for streptavidin differed by approximately 2 orders of magnitude
between pH 5.2 and 7.4. We also performed structural and mechanistic
analysis of one of our aptamers and found that its pH sensitivity
is governed in part by a single-G-A mismatch, which is known to be
stabilized at acidic pH. We believe our strategy could be generalized
for generating high-quality pH-sensitive aptamers for a wide range
of other molecules, eliminating much of the labor and constraints
associated with conventional aptamer design strategies. Such aptamers
would be useful for both in vivo and in vitro applications, including
drug delivery, sensing, and the development of pH-sensitive smart
nanomaterials.

Results and Discussion
Library Design and Screening
Strategy
We devised a
molecular library design that enabled us to screen directly for aptamers
that exhibit pH-dependent target binding. Each library molecule comprises
a known aptamer sequence fused to a 20-nucleotide (nt) randomized
domain (Figure 1A),
with these two segments flanked by PCR primer-binding sites. The objective
is to isolate library molecules that maintain a conformation favoring
target binding at permissive pH, but which undergo denaturation or
refolding at nonpermissive pH into a conformation that subsequently
promotes target release. We chose streptavidin as a model target because
it is a well-characterized protein that remains stable across a wide
pH range. We chose to use SBA29, which was previously isolated by
Bing and co-workers and has a reported equilibrium dissociation constant
(Kd) of 40 ± 18 nM.21

Figure 1 Overview of pH-based particle display screening. (A) Our library
design includes a known aptamer sequence—in this demonstration,
the streptavidin aptamer SBA29—and a 20-nt random region. The
objective of this screen was to identify sequences that bind streptavidin
at pH 7.4 but experience disruption of the SBA29 aptamer domain at
pH 5.2 to eliminate target binding. (B) Scheme for pH-switching particle
display screen. (1) Emulsion PCR is used to generate monoclonal aptamer
particles, which are then (2) incubated with fluorescently labeled
streptavidin at pH 7.4. (3) FACS is used to collect aptamer particles
that are bound to the fluorescent target at this pH. (4) These are
then incubated with labeled streptavidin at pH 5.2, and (5) FACS is
used to collect only nonfluorescent aptamers, which no longer bind
the target at this acidic pH. These are either (6) subjected to PCR
amplification for another round of screening or (7) sequenced for
further characterization.

We screened for aptamers that maintain target binding at
pH 7.4
but release their target at pH 5.2. Our procedure (Figure 1B) is a variation on the previously
described particle display platform, a high-throughput aptamer screening
strategy based on FACS that enables the analysis of individual aptamer
binding characteristics at a rate of ∼106 sequences/h.19 The critical difference between this platform
and conventional SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment) is that aptamers in solution are transformed into monoclonal
aptamer particles, allowing the measurement and sorting of each individual
aptamer sequence. FACS enables fine discrimination of the highest
affinity aptamers in a given pool, leading to much higher enrichment
rates in each round of screening than are possible with conventional
SELEX.

First, we used emulsion PCR to convert a solution-phase
DNA library
of ∼109 molecules into monoclonal aptamer particles,
which each display many copies of a single sequence (Figure 1B, step 1). These were then
subjected to two sequential sorting procedures to identify sequences
with pH-dependent binding behavior. For the first sort, we incubated
the aptamer particles with fluorescently labeled streptavidin in pH
7.4 selection buffer (step 2) and used FACS to collect all particles
that bound streptavidin at this pH (step 3). We then sought to isolate
aptamer particles that lost their ability to bind streptavidin under
more acidic conditions, so we reincubated the collected particles
with streptavidin in pH 5.2 selection buffer (step 4). In the subsequent
round of FACS, we collected all nonfluorescent aptamer particles,
representing sequences that could no longer bind streptavidin as a
result of a pH-induced conformational change (step 5). The aptamer
particles collected at this step were PCR amplified to create the
aptamer pool for the next round (step 6). After three rounds of screening,
we subjected all three aptamer pools to high-throughput sequencing
(step 7).

Particle Display Screening for pH-Switching Aptamers
We performed three rounds of particle display screening against streptavidin,
as described above. Prior to each sorting step, we incubated the aptamer
particles with 200 nM streptavidin labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (SA-AF488)
for 1 h. In the first FACS screen, all of the sequences that bound
streptavidin at pH 7.4 were collected. We defined the nonfluorescent
reference gate using unlabeled beads, and defined the sort gate to
include all sequences with higher fluorescence intensity than this
background level. We did not set the gates to exclude lower affinity
aptamers because we wanted to optimize our selection for the identification
of aptamers that undergo pH-induced switching rather than selecting
primarily for extremely high affinity to streptavidin. We then incubated
the collected aptamer particles from the first FACS sort step with
200 nM SA-AF488 in pH 5.2 selection buffer for 30 min. For the second
sorting step, we collected all of the aptamer particles that did not
bind streptavidin at pH 5.2. Sorting was performed with the same gate
positions as in the first sorting step, but this time we collected
the aptamer particles from the reference (nonbinding) gate and discarded
those in the high-fluorescence gate. The second round was performed
with the same conditions as the first round. In the third round, only
the first FACS sort step was performed, collecting aptamer particles
with high fluorescence intensity after incubation with 200 nM SA-AF488
at pH 7.4.

Over the course of three rounds, we observed a clear
increase in both streptavidin binding and pH-induced switching behavior
of the aptamer pool (Figure 2). After preparing the aptamer particles for each pool, we
tested the binding of the particles to streptavidin at pH 7.4 and
pH 5.2 as a prelude to particle display screening. Based on this analysis,
we determined that the proportion of aptamer particles residing within
the sort gate increased from 3.1% of the initial library to 11.8%
of the round 3 pool, indicating a clear increase in the number of
streptavidin-binding sequences. More notably, the proportion of aptamer
particles that retained binding to their target at pH 5.2 steadily
decreased over the course of screening, from 6.92% in round 1 to 5.05%
in round 2 to just 1.35% in the final round. Based on these measurements,
we determined that the ratio of binding at pH 7.4 to binding at pH
5.2 increased from 1.1 for the starting library to 2.1 and 1.9 for
the round 1 and round 2 pools, respectively. For the round 3 pool,
this ratio increased dramatically to 8.7. Because the round 3 pool
demonstrated strong pH-sensitivity, we did not perform further rounds
of screening.

particle
display screen. Each set of binding measurements was collected prior
to screening. The box denotes aptamer particles with fluorescence
above background at pH 7.4 (top) and pH 5.2 (bottom). The percentage
of particles residing within the high-fluorescence gate is shown in
each plot. By round 3, a large population of aptamer particles exhibited
pH-switching, with high binding at pH 7.4 and low binding at pH 5.2.

High-Throughput Sequencing
Reveals Aptamers Enriched Based on
pH Sensitivity
To better characterize the enrichment that
had taken place, we performed high-throughput sequencing of the three
aptamer pools. We prepared the pools for sequencing by adding different
indices to each pool using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation
Kit from Illumina (see Supporting Information (SI)). Sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq at
the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. After filtering out low-quality
sequences, we obtained 1,035,183 reads with 363,155 unique sequences
(35.1%) in round 1, 1,160,070 reads with 257,612 unique sequences
(22.2%) in round 2, and 1,150,478 reads with 180,777 unique sequences
(15.7%) in round 3. This indicates that even though the diversity
of the pool decreased each round, there was still considerable diversity
in the round 3 pool. We analyzed the copy number and enrichment of
each sequence to identify top aptamer candidates for further functional
characterization, and identified several aptamers that greatly outperformed
the rest of the pool in terms of either their copy number in round
3 or their enrichment from round 1 to round 3 (Figure 3A). We selected 10 sequences for further
analysis: the seven most highly enriched sequences and three most
abundant sequences from round 3 (Supporting Information Table S-1).

Red dots show the seven most highly enriched sequences from round
1 to round 3 (upper left) and the three most abundant sequences from
round 3 (lower right), which were selected for further testing. (B)
These sequences were tested for pH-dependent binding in a fluorescence
assay. Each sequence was conjugated to beads, and binding to streptavidin–phycoerythrin
(SA-PE) conjugates (50 nM) was measured at pH 7.4 and pH 5.2. We selected
the two sequences with the greatest difference in SA-PE binding at
pH 7.4 and pH 5.2 (shown in red) for further characterization.

We synthesized these 10 candidate
sequences and examined their
binding characteristics in a fluorescence assay, incubating particles
displaying each sequence with a streptavidin–phycoerythrin
(SA-PE) conjugate (Figure 3B). Eight of the 10 sequences exhibited greater binding to
streptavidin at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.2, and we selected the two sequences
that showed the largest decrease in binding from pH 7.4 to pH 5.2
(S3 and S8) for further testing.

Aptamers Isolated via Particle
Display Exhibit Strong pH Sensitivity
Our analysis of S3
and S8 revealed that our selection procedure
is highly effective at isolating pH-responsive derivatives of existing
aptamers. We generated particles displaying these two sequences as
well as the original SBA29 aptamer and used flow cytometry to measure
the fluorescence intensity of the aptamer particles after incubating
with SA-PE at a range of concentrations at both pH 7.4 and pH 5.2
(Figure 4). We used
a saturation binding model (one site, total binding) to determine
the Kd for each sequence. SBA29 exhibited
minimal pH sensitivity, with a similar Kd under both conditions: 10.4 ± 1.5 nM at pH 7.4 and 3.50 ±
0.46 nM at pH 5.2.

Figure 4 Streptavidin-binding measurements of SBA29 and
the selected aptamers
S3 and S8 in a fluorescent bead-based assay at (A) pH 7.4 and (B)
pH 5.2. Error bars were determined from the standard deviation of
experimental replicates (n = 2 for SBA29; pH 5.2, n = 3 for all other samples). (N.D. = not determined.)

In contrast, the binding affinity
was strongly pH-dependent for
both S3 and S8. These two aptamers bound strongly to streptavidin
at pH 7.4, with Kd of 24.2 ± 3.4
and 112 ± 19 nM for S3 and S8, respectively. However, both aptamers
had much weaker binding at pH 5.2. Indeed, we were not able to test
high enough target concentrations to reach a stable bound plateau
for either aptamer at pH 5.2 in order to obtain a meaningful Kd (Figure 4B). As a control experiment, we also measured the fluorescence
of forward primer-conjugated beads without aptamers at both pH values,
with and without SA-PE. We observed minimal signal, demonstrating
that nonspecific target–bead interactions do not produce any
meaningful background at either pH 5.2 or 7.4 (Figure S-1).

We chose to perform more detailed characterization
for S8 because
it had minimal binding at pH 5.2, indicating strong pH-sensitivity.
Since bead-based fluorescent measurements are performed with many
aptamers conjugated to particles, avidity effects can impact the measured
binding affinity. We therefore used microscale thermophoresis (MST)
to independently assess the solution-phase binding affinities of SBA29
and S8. As with our bead-based assay, MST demonstrated the pH-insensitivity
of SBA29, which exhibited Kd of 6.1 and
27 nM at pH 7.4 and at pH 5.2, respectively (Figure 5A,B), whereas S8 again exhibited striking
pH sensitivity. At pH 7.4, we determined that S8 has a Kd of 10 nM (Figure 5C); this is ∼10-fold lower than the Kd we measured by bead-based measurements but represents
reasonable agreement given the differences in the two measurement
techniques. But at pH 5.2, as with the bead-based assay, S8’s
affinity was too low to obtain a meaningful Kd (Figure 5D).
From the observed binding response, we estimate that the Kd is in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range, which
indicates that our aptamer’s streptavidin affinity at pH 7.4
is roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than at pH 5.2. In order to
better characterize the nature of S8’s pH response, we measured
streptavidin binding at a range of pH values between pH 5.2 and pH
7.4. This yielded a sigmoidal binding curve, indicating a gradual
rather than single-step pH response, where a half-maximal signal occurs
at pH 6.5 (Figure S-2).

(A) pH 7.4 and (B) pH 5.2 and for S8 at (C) pH 7.4 and (D) pH 5.2. Kd is shown for all experiments except S8 at
pH 5.2, for which this measurement could not be determined reliably.

Nucleotide Mismatch Contributes
to pH Sensitivity
After
affinity testing, we predicted the secondary structure for S8 using
mfold.22 Our analysis determined that S8
has two predicted secondary structures. In one, SBA29 retains its
nominal conformation, with the randomized domain hybridized to one
of the primer-binding sequences (Figure 6A). In the second structure, the randomized
region hybridizes with the SBA29 sequence, preventing it from folding
into a conformation that enables streptavidin binding (Figure 6B). The base-pairing between
SBA29 and the randomized domain within the latter, “blocked”
structure contains a predicted G-A mismatch, a pairing which has been
computationally and experimentally shown to be stabilized at acidic
pH.23−25 We therefore hypothesized that the latter structure
may be energetically favorable at pH 5.2, whereas the first structure,
in which SBA29 is properly folded, is more stable at pH 7.4.

structures for pH-switching aptamer S8. (A)
The SBA29 aptamer domain (orange) is folded correctly in the lowest
free energy structure and does not interact with the randomized domain

same sequence (right) shows the SBA29 domain (orange) blocked by the
randomized domain (purple). The portion of the sequence shown in panel

Three experimental replicates were performed, and mean + SD is shown.

We generated various point mutations
in the S8 aptamer that were
predicted to affect the stability of the low-pH blocked structure
(red bases in Figure 6C). We then tested these S8 variants in a binding assay in which
we incubated aptamer particles displaying each mutant sequence with
fluorescently labeled streptavidin at pH 7.4 and pH 5.2. By measuring
the fluorescence intensity of the streptavidin-bound aptamer particles,
we were able to identify which mutations increased or decreased the
affinity of the aptamer to streptavidin at each pH. First, we replaced
the mismatches at positions 61 and 62 with nucleotides that enable
canonical base-pairing (G61 and T62); unlike the G-A pairing at base
62, the predicted C-T mismatch that normally occurs at base 61 is
not stabilized at acidic pH.23 We expected
that these substitutions would stabilize the blocked structure, and
indeed, these two mutations both exhibited greatly reduced binding
(by 75% and 65%, respectively) at pH 7.4.

Next, we introduced
other mismatches at the predicted pH-dependent
mismatch site. Based on mfold simulations, both the A62 and C62 variants
are predicted to favor the blocked structure (ΔG = −23.52 and −23.22 kcal/mol, respectively). Although
these structures are slightly less stable than G61 and T62 (ΔG = −27.77 and −25.08 kcal/mol, respectively),
both sequences still have significantly reduced streptavidin binding
at pH 7.4. Notably, replacing the pH-sensitive G-A mismatch with a
C-A mismatch (C62) significantly reduced binding at pH 7.4, even though
C-A is also selectively stabilized at acidic pH.23,25 This shows that the G-A mismatch provides the correct balance to
favor folding of SBA29 at pH 7.4 and to disrupt this binding by stabilizing
the blocked structure at pH 5.2.

Finally, we replaced three
different G-C pairs in the stem of the
blocked structure with a C-A or G-A mismatch (A59, A65, A67) to see
if the introduction of a second pH-sensitive mismatch would strengthen
S8’s pH-switching behavior. We observed far less pH responsiveness
in A59, with high levels of binding in both pH conditions. We hypothesize
that this is because the elimination of the G-C pair greatly destabilizes
the stem of the blocked structure and enables the SBA29 domain to
remain folded at both pH values. The introduction of a second G-A
mismatch to the stem of the blocked structure in A65 and A67 enabled
retention of high binding at pH 7.4, but also resulted in moderately
high levels of binding at pH 5.2. This is likely because the G-C pair
is more stable than the G-A mismatch, even at acidic pH, such that
the stem in the blocked structure becomes less stable. Nevertheless,
these sequences still retained some pH sensitivity.

Overall,
these results support a model in which hybridization between
the randomized domain in S8 and the SBA29 aptamer domain contribute
to the formation of a blocked structure that is incapable of
binding to streptavidin. Although the full mechanism of this pH-switching
behavior is presently not fully understood, the pH dependence of the
noncanonical G-A pairing at site 62 appears to play a critical role
in determining aptamer stability and conformation at acidic versus
neutral pH conditions.

Conclusion
In this work, we describe
a rapid and high-throughput method that
enables us to screen for pH-sensitive derivatives of existing aptamers
based on particle display, without the need for labor-intensive aptamer
engineering procedures.10,26 As a demonstration,
we isolated aptamers that exhibit high affinity for streptavidin at
neutral pH but release their cargo under acidic conditions after only
three rounds of screening. One of these aptamers, S8, retained the
nanomolar target affinity of its parent aptamer at pH 7.4, but exhibited
an estimated 100-fold decrease in streptavidin affinity at pH 5.2
versus pH 7.4. Upon modeling the predicted secondary structure of
S8, we identified two different conformations for this aptamer that
appear to be governed in part by a pH-sensitive, noncanonical base-pair.
At neutral pH, the streptavidin-binding aptamer domain retains the
secondary structure of the non-pH-responsive parent aptamer, SBA29.
However, acidic conditions favor a reorganization of the aptamer in
which this target-binding domain is incorporated into a stem loop
by base-pairing with the randomized sequence that was selected during
our screening process. This stem contains a G-A mismatch with known
pH-responsive characteristics, and we used mutational analysis to
confirm that both this base-pair and the stem-forming elements of
the randomized domain in general are critical to the aptamer’s
pH-responsive characteristics. These results demonstrate that our
screening method can be used to generate high-affinity aptamers with
pH-responsive functionality without relying exclusively on previously
identified pH-sensitive motifs.17,18 As such, we believe
this approach will prove highly valuable for generating environmentally
responsive aptamers for drug delivery, biosensors, and a variety of
other applications.
