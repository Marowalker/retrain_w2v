Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors are
a valuable tool to quantify cell biology, yet it remains necessary
to identify and prevent potential artifacts in order to exploit their
full potential. We show here that artifacts arising from slow donor
mCerulean3 maturation can be substantially diminished by constitutive
expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, which can also
be achieved by incorporation of faster-maturing FRET donors. We developed
an improved version of the donor mTurquoise2 that matures faster than
the parent protein. Our analysis shows that using equal maturing fluorophores
in FRET-based sensors or using constitutive low expression conditions
helps to reduce maturation-induced artifacts, without the need of
additional noise-inducing spectral corrections. In general, we show
that monitoring and controlling the maturation of fluorescent proteins
in living cells is important and should be addressed in in
vivo applications of genetically encoded FRET sensors.

==== Body
Sensors based
on FRET provide
precise readout in space and time, and molecular engineering allows
an impressive control over selectivity, sensitivity, and spatiotemporal
localization of the probes. When these sensors contain fluorescent
proteins as FRET donor and acceptor, they are expressed directly inside
the living cell, allowing relatively unperturbed FRET measurements
in real-time. Consequently, a large toolbox of FRET sensors is available,
generating a plethora of insights in cell biology.1−3 The use of fluorescent
proteins in FRET sensors is not without artifacts. Parameters such
as pH,4 fluorescent protein maturation,5 fluorescent protein oligomerization,6 sensor proteolysis, and other physical chemical
effects such as nonspecific analyte binding7 and macromolecular crowding8 can induce
systematic errors and need to be taken into account. Although the
premier method to test for inaccuracies would be a measurement based
on another technology, this is not always possible. Instead, artifacts
may be identified, for example, by the construction of sensors with
a nonfunctional sensing domain. In cell calibration
of the sensors, fluorescent protein engineering, or spectral corrections9,10 can, for example, resolve inaccuracies in the measurement.

Because an unequal number of donor and acceptor affect the FRET
readout, fully mature fluorescent proteins would greatly improve accuracy.
The synthesis of GFP-type fluorescent proteins goes through several
stages of processing, including folding, cyclization, dehydration,
and aerial oxidation.11,12 More complicated maturation kinetics
can occur due to additional oxidations, cis–trans isomerization, or rearrangement of amino acids near the fluorophore.
The in vivo maturation time of commonly used fluorescent
proteins ranges widely from 5 min to >200 min in Escherichia
coli and often depends on the cell type.13 The fluorescent protein maturation can vary with growth
rate; doubling the growth rate of E. coli resulted
in a 1.4 times longer maturation time, possibly due to a lower oxygen
availability in the cell.14

Previously,
we developed probes that sense macromolecular crowding
inside living cells, containing mCerulean315 as a donor and mCitrine as an acceptor, and a flexible linker in
between (crGE, Figure 1).16,17 The sensors detect changes in the excluded
volume (or in general terms macromolecular crowding) after an osmotic
upshift in both bacterial and mammalian cells by a change in FRET
efficiency. When applying the sensors under different expression conditions,
however, we measured increasing FRET ratios with increasing inducer
concentration; the FRET signal is stable under constitutive expression.
Here, we show that this dependence is caused by a difference in maturation
of the fluorescent proteins. We find that the high FRET is caused
by slow mCerulean3 maturation in combination with acceptor cross-excitation.
We alleviate these issues by constitutive expression in both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells and using faster-maturing donors such as mTurquoise218 and mTurquoise2.1.

Figure 1 Structure of the FRET
sensor with mCerulean3 as donor and mCitrine
as acceptor, and a flexible linker connecting the two proteins. Upon
excitation at 405 nm the sensor emits fluorescence with a maximum
at 475 nm for mCerulean3, and a maximum at 525 nm for mCitrine due
to FRET. The sensor gives rise to a FRET efficiency of ∼10%,
which increases with macromolecular crowding. The spectra displayed
are in 10 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, without macromolecular crowding. The spectrum
without FRET is after linker cleavage with proteinase K.

Experimental Section
Plasmid
Construction in E. coli
Plasmids
bearing crGE, crGEs, and crcpGE in pRSET A were described previously.16,17 crGE containing silent mutations, to introduce additional restriction
sites, was obtained from GeneArt and subcloned into pACYC in between SalI and BamHI sites. To remove an unintended
ribosome-binding site in this construct, that induced high acceptor
only expression, we use the QuickChange protocol to mutate M363G and
V364G with forward primer GAGGTAGCGGTGGGTCCGGTGGGAGTAAAGGTGAGGAAC
and reverse primer GTTCCTCACCTTTACTCCCACCGGACCCACCGCTACCTC.
DNA encoding mTurquoise2 (PMK plasmid, GeneArt) was cloned with NsiI and BamHI into pRSET A, carrying the
gene for the crGE probe. mTurquoise2.1 was obtained by QuickChange
site-directed mutagenesis with forward primer GCCGGATAATCATTATCTGAGCATTCAGAGCAAACTGAGC
and reverse primer GCTCAGTTTGCTCTGAATGCTCAGATAATGATTATCCGGC
on mTurquoise2 in the PMK plasmid as template. PCR products were treated
with Dpn1 for 1 h at 37 °C, transformed into E. coli MC1061, and cells were plated on LB agar plates.
The T203I mutant was subcloned into pRSET A as above. To obtain cytoplasmic
maltose-binding protein (cyMBP), we removed the signal sequence from
the malE gene in the pACYC vector, using the USER
cloning protocol, with forward primer ACCATGAAAAUCGAAGAAGGTAAACTGGTAATCTGG
and reverse primer ATTTTCATGGUCGACCACCTCCTG.

Plasmid
Construction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
For GAL1-regulated expression of the crGE-NLS, the S. cerevisiae codon-optimized gene of the crGE sequence
in pYES2 (GeneArt, Invitrogen) was amplified together with pGAL1 and
CYC1 by PCR with the forward primer GGTGCCGTAAAGCAG
and reverse primer ATCGGTCGACCCCAATACGCAAACCGC,
introducing a SalI site downstream of the terminator.
The sequence was subcloned into a pRS303 yeast integrative vector
in between SpeI and SalI sites to
achieve chromosomal integration in the HIS3 locus.
All cloning steps were carried out in pYES2 template, and consecutively
amplified using the above-mentioned primers to integrate the gene
into pRS303. pTEF1 was amplified by PCR from pYM-N1819 with forward primer CGAGCTACTAGTCATAGCTTCAAAATGTTTCTACTCC,
introducing a SpeI site upstream of the promoter,
and reverse primer GTGCAGAAGCTTCTTAGATTAGATTGCTATGC,
introducing a HindIII site downstream for integration
in pYES2-pGAL1-crGE-NLS. The resulting construct was subcloned in
pRS303 for chromosomal integration. All pRS303 crGE-NLS constructs
were sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations originated
because of the multiple PCR steps.

Yeast Strains and Growth
Conditions
All yeast strains
were constructed in the BY4741 genetic background (his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0).20 Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C,
200 rpm. For strains expressing the crGE-NLS sensor under the GAL1
promoter, the cells were pre-cultured in Synthetic Dropout medium
without histidine (SD-his), 2% (w/v) glucose and grown overnight.
On the next day the cells were diluted 100× in 10 mL of SD-his
2% raffinose and 0.1% glucose. After 7 h of incubation appropriate
dilutions were made in SD-his 2% raffinose to obtain cultures in the
exponential growth phase on the third day (OD600 = 0.4–0.8).
The induction time was ∼2.5 h. For mixed medium conditions,
the same pre-culturing steps were followed in SD-his 2% galactose
and 0.2% glucose containing medium. Strains expressing the crGE-NLS
sensor under the TEF1 promoter were pre-grown under the same scheme
of dilutions, but in SD-his and 2% glucose for all steps.

Protein Expression
and Purification
E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS
with the pRSET A vector containing the desired sensor
was grown to OD600 = 0.6 in LB medium (10 g/L tryptone,
5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl), and induced with 1 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight
at 25 °C. The cells were spun down at 3000g for
30 min, resuspended in buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate (NaPi), 100
mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 7.4), and
lysed in a TissueLyser LT (QIAGEN). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation
(5 min, 10000g), and the supernatant was supplemented
with 10 mM imidazole. Subsequently, the proteins were purified by
nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid Sepharose (NTA-Sepharose) chromatography
(wash/elution buffer: 20/250 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaPi, 300 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4). The constructs were further purified by Superdex 200 10/300GL
size-exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mM NaPi
100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The expression and purification were analyzed
by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by in-gel fluorescence
and subsequent Coomassie staining. Fractions containing pure protein
were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

To obtain mCerulean3
and mCitrine separately, the crGE sensor, bound to NTA-Sepharose,
was treated on-column with proteinase K (Sigma) for 5 min. The mixture
was first washed with 20 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaPi, 300 mM NaCl, pH
7.4, to collect mCitrine, and then washed with 250 mM imidazole, 50
mM NaPi, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, to collect mCerulean3. The fractions
containing a single fluorescent protein were further purified by size-exclusion
chromatography and analyzed as above.

Maturation Measurements
with Chloramphenicol
E. coli BL21(DE3) strain,
without pLysS, with pRSET A containing
the gene encoding the corresponding probe, was inoculated in 10 mL
of filter-sterilized MOPS minimal medium21 containing 20 mM glucose at 30 °C. The culture was grown to
OD600 = 0.1–0.2, and treated with 200 μg/mL
chloramphenicol to stop protein synthesis. The fluorescence emission
spectra (λEx = 405 nm for CFPs, and λEx = 515 for YFPs) were recorded every 30 min after the addition of
chloramphenicol, and the spectra were corrected for OD600. The spectra were corrected for background fluorescence by subtraction
of spectra of the same strain without plasmid but treated in the same
manner. The data were fitted to a single exponential to determine
the maturation characteristics.

Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy
(Imaging of E. coli)
Ratiometric FRET measurements
of E. coli by scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy
were carried out as
reported previously.16 Briefly, the culture
was grown in MOPS minimal medium containing 20 mM glucose to OD600 = 0.1–0.2. In parallel, the same E. coli strain with the pRSET A plasmid containing monomeric streptavidin
served as background. For both cultures, the proteins were constitutively
expressed, i.e., in the absence of inducer. The cells were combined
in a 1:1 ratio and washed by centrifugation and resuspension in MOPS
minimal medium with the desired amount of NaCl, but without potassium
phosphate and glucose to minimize adaptation of the cells to the osmotic
stress imposed by the addition of NaCl. Next, 10 μL of this
mixture was added to a coverslip modified with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(Aldrich).17 The coverslip was placed on
a 40× water immersion objective lens on a laser-scanning confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). For imaging, we used a 405 nm diode laser
for excitation and the emission was split into the 450–505
nm and 505–797 nm channels. For following IPTG overexpression,
cells were grown overnight at 30 °C, and when achieving an OD600 of 0.05, they were incubated for 1 h with shaking at 20
°C. After 1 h, 1 mM IPTG was added, and the cultured were measured
every hour thereafter.

To quantify bleed through and cross excitation,
a droplet (20 μL, 10 mM NaPi, 2 mg/mL BSA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.)
containing either purified crGE, mCerulean3, or mCitrine was placed
on the coverslip, and the fluorophores were excited at 405 nm and
the emission was split into the 405–505 nm and 505–797
nm channels. The fluorescent proteins were then excited at 488 nm,
and the emission was collected between 505 and 797 nm.

To determine
ratiometric FRET during IPTG overexpression in confocal
microscopy, the measurements were carried out as above, with the exception
that after growth at 30 °C to OD600 = 0.1, cells were
left growing at 20 °C for 1 h to allow cells to adapt to the
lower temperature, prior to addition of 1 mM IPTG. Samples were measured
from the liquid culture shaking at 20 °C every hour.

Wide-Field
Fluorescence Microscopy: Imaging of S. cerevisiae
All in vivo experiments were performed
at 30 °C. Images were acquired using a DeltaVision Elite imaging
system (Applied Precision (GE), Issaquah, WA, USA) composed of an
inverted microscope (IX-71; Olympus) equipped with a UPlanSApo 100×
(1.4 NA) oil immersion objective, InsightSSI solid-state illumination,
excitation and emission filters for CFP and YFP, ultimate focus, and
a PCO sCMOS camera. Excitation and emission wavelengths for CFP were
438/24 (middle wavelength/bandpass) and 475/24 nm, and for YFP 513/17
and 543/22 nm. Stacks of 30 images with 0.2 μm spacing were
taken at an exposure time of 25 ms. The images were taken for the
CFP, YFP, and FRET channels. For the FRET channel the excitation wavelength
was 438/24 nm (CFP channel), and the emission was measured at 543/22
nm (YFP channel).

Processing of all images was performed using
Fiji (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health). For each image, the
z-stack with the highest fluorescence intensity was selected. For
each channel, the background was measured from a region outside the
cell and subtracted before the FRET/CFP and YFP/CFP ratios were derived.

To quantify FRET/CFP and YFP/CFP ratios of the purified sensor,
a droplet (20 μL, 10 mM NaPi, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 100 mM NaCl, pH
7.4) containing 16 ng/mL crGE was imaged at 20°C with 30 z-stacks
of 1 μm spacing. In parallel, buffer without protein content
was imaged to determine the background. The obtained values were subtracted
from the sensor measurements before FRET/CFP and YFP/CFP ratios were
derived.

Results
Slow Donor Maturation Gives
Artificially High FRET Ratios with
Expression from an Inducible Promoter
To quantify macromolecular
crowding with the crGE sensor in E. coli, we previously
expressed the crowding sensor with a constitutive promoter, that is,
uninduced (“leaky”) expression from the T7 promoter
in the pRSET A plasmid, and observed consistently FRET/donor ratios
of 1.05 ± 0.04.16 However, addition
of 1 mM IPTG leads to a ratio of ∼1.15 after 0.5 h, while fluorescent
inclusion bodies start to appear at the poles after ∼1 h due
to overexpression of the sensor. To obtain more control over the expression
levels, we placed the sensor in the pACYC plasmid under a rhamnose
promoter (rha), which provides tight control over
expression and results in lower sensor concentrations. Surprisingly,
we observe that also under these conditions the FRET ratios are higher
than constitutive expression, and they resulted in a ratio of ∼1.3
after overnight expression. Further, subsequent removal of the inducer,
rhamnose, after the overnight expression, reduced the ratios from
∼1.3 after induction to ∼1.05 upon a ∼4-h post-induction
period. This ratio is the same as under constitutive expression, indicating
that the high apparent FRET ratios are related to the inducible expression.

To verify that protein synthesis from an inducible promoter does
not increase the macromolecular crowding, we expressed a nonfluorescent
protein (maltose-binding protein, cyMBP) in the cytoplasm of E. coli (Figure 2). We simultaneously monitored crowding with the crGE sensor
under constitutive expression. The FRET ratios are ∼1.05 and
independent of cyMBP expression, suggesting that the high FRET ratios
are an artifact of the sensor. Expression from an inducible promoter
did not cause sensor truncation, because this would retain the high
FRET ratios in a post-induction experiment. Increased intermolecular
FRET would be an alternative mechanism that could explain sensitivity
to the expression conditions; in this case, we would expect a relation
between the intensity and the FRET observed. We do not see this relation
when comparing cells with different amounts of the sensor from the
same promoter, and neither when comparing the fluorescence obtained
from the rha promoter with the constitutive T7 promoter.

Figure 2 Expression
of crGE from an inducible promoter increases the FRET
signal independent of the crowding of E. coli. (A)
Red circles: crGE sensor under the rha promoter after
induction with 0.2% rhamnose. The cells became sufficiently fluorescent
after 3 h to determine the FRET/mCerulean3 ratio. Blue circles: cells
containing two plasmids, one to express cytoplasmic maltose-binding
protein (cyMBP) from the rha promoter (induced at t = 0) and the other to express crGE from the T7 promoter, which gives constitutive (leaky) expression. (B) A post-induction
period after overnight expression decreases FRET/CFP levels back to
those under constitutive expression. The crGE sensor was expressed
from the rha promoter in the presence of 0.1% (w/v)
rhamnose in Mops medium supplemented with 20 mM glucose; the induction
was halted at t = 0 by removal of rhamnose. Three
biological replicates were tested for each condition. Error bars are
the standard deviation over the biological replicates (gray dashed
lines). Individual measurements across about 100 E. coli cells yielded a standard deviation of 0.05 and a standard error
of the mean of <0.01.

In a separate experiment, we obtained higher apparent FRET
ratios
with an additional ribosome-binding site (RBS) in the linker region,
yielding high amounts of mCitrine compared to mCerulean3 due to translation
initiation in the middle of the sensor gene, at −10 bases from
mCitrine. Subsequent removal of the RBS led to intact sensor with
FRET ratios as before. The observation that a higher concentration
of mCitrine leads to higher apparent FRET ratios leads us to hypothesize
that the high ratios from an inducible promoter could be caused by
a very slow maturing mCerulean3, hence a relatively high acceptor
concentration.

To confirm that the mCerulean3 indeed matures
more slowly, we quantified
its maturation in vivo. We added chloramphenicol
to a culture of cells that expressed the crowding sensor under a constitutive
promoter (T7, Figure 3) and measured samples at regular time intervals by fluorometry.
Arresting protein synthesis results in an increase in fluorescence
due to maturation of the remaining immature fluorescent protein. The
percentage increase would be higher with slow maturing fluorescent
proteins. We find that in the first 30 min the fluorescence increase
of mCitrine (10–20% (n = 3)) is less than
that of mCerulean3 (30–40% (n = 3)), and mCitrine
reaches maximum maturation after 30 min while it takes ∼100
min for mCerulean3, and mCitrine/mCerulean3 ratios only stabilize
after ∼100 min, which is consistent with a recent study.13 After longer incubation times with chloramphenicol
we observed a slow decrease in fluorescence, possibly caused by degradation
or changes in the fluorophore. Altogether, we conclude that mCerulean3
matures slowly and is the likely cause of the higher FRET/CFP ratios
when an inducible promoter is used.

Figure 3 Determination of maturation of the fluorescent
proteins in crGE
by chloramphenicol addition, showing that mCerulean3 matures much
slower than mCitrine. The mCitrine/mCerulean3 decreases because of
slower maturation of mCerulean3. The sensor was constitutively expressed
from the T7 promoter in pRSET A in E. coli BL21(DE3)
pLysS grown in MOPS-minimal medium at 30 °C, and chloramphenicol
(200 μg/mL) was added at t = 0 at OD600 ≈ 0.1. The increase in fluorescence of both donor and acceptor
from maturation of immature protein was determined by fluorometry.
The data were normalized to t = 0. Representative
data are displayed; biological replicates are shown in Figure S2.

Expression Conditions Affect Fluorescent Protein Maturation
in Yeast
To assess whether the dependence on the expression
method is not exclusive to E. coli, we assessed the
sensor performance in S. cerevisiae. The sensor was
directed to the nucleus of S. cerevisiae by fusing
a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminus, and the gene was
integrated into the genome to remove expression heterogeneity caused
by variation in plasmid copy number. We compared the expression from
the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter and a constitutive TEF1 promoter.
In all cases, we observe localization of the sensor in the nucleus
of S. cerevisiae. As in E. coli,
we find that expression from an inducible promoter provides higher
FRET/mCerulean3 ratios compared to constitutive expression (Figure 4). This increase
in FRET/mCerulean3 follows the maturation of mCerulean3: When comparing
the fluorescence of the mCerulean3 and mCitrine, each excited separately,
we find that expression under an inducible promoter gives higher mCitrine/mCerulean3
ratios (mCitrine/mCerulean3 = 1.2 ± 0.13) than constitutive expression
(mCitrine/mCerulean3 0.77 ± 0.08). The mCitrine/mCerulean3 under
constitutive expression is closer to that of the isolated sensor in
buffer, which is 0.56, indicating that under constitutive conditions
the maturation is maximized.

Figure 4 Maturation in S. cerevisiae depends on the expression
method and affects FRET, as determined by wide-field fluorescence
microscopy. The FRET values are lower than in, e.g., in Figure 2, because those were measured
on a confocal microscope. (A) Comparison of the FRET/mCerulean3 ratios
of the different expression conditions from data presented in Figure S3. (B) mCitrine/mCerulean3 ratios show
that maturation affects the accuracy of the crowding read-out.

To reduce the expression from
the GAL1 promoter, we added 0.2%
glucose.22 Indeed, by addition of a repressor,
the sensors appeared to age sufficiently to provide the FRET/mCerulean3
and mCitrine/mCerulean3 ratios as under constitutive expression. The
combination of an inducer and repressor creates a somewhat larger
variation between the cells.

We conclude that donor maturation
and the FRET ratios can be tuned
by varying the expression conditions, where constitutive expression
allows reliable FRET measurements in both yeast and bacteria, and
we speculate this may be true for other cell types as well.

Replacement
with Faster-Maturing Donors Relieves Expression
Sensitivity
Next, we reduced the expression dependence by
increasing the maturation rate of the FRET donor. The FRET probe senses
crowding by a polymer-type compression in crowded environments, due
to its flexible linker with freely rotating fluorescent proteins,17,23 and the sensor is therefore independent of the identity of the fluorescent
protein. Indeed, we made several constructs with varying donors and
acceptors, and found that they were all compressed by the presence
of Ficoll 70 (Figure S4). Crowding also
compresses sensors with the combinations EGFP-mCherry,24 and Clover-mRuby2,25 as well as polymers equipped with synthetic dyes.26 All sensors based on CFP-YFP function in E. coli: osmotic upshift increases the FRET ratios, and calibration provides
crowding values in percentages of Ficoll equivalents (Figure S4). The mTurquoise2-mCitrine combination
(crTC2) provides lower FRET ratios than crGE in cells, but calibration
with purified protein provides the same weight percentage of Ficoll
equivalents. Hence, the nature of the fluorescent protein does not
play a role in the crowding sensor, that is, under constitutive expression.

We replaced the mCerulean3 with mTurquoise2, because it is the
brightest cyan fluorescent protein to date.18 We mutated a single amino acid in mTurquoise2, in an attempt to
increase its maturation rate. Because the reaction with oxygen is
a rate-determining step (although folding contributes as well),27 we reasoned that if we could force the desired
conformation onto the tyrosine side chain to undergo the reaction
with oxygen, generating the planar alkene of the fluorophore, we would
accelerate maturation. Residue 203 can interact with the tyrosine
phenol,28,29 and we mutated the threonine 203 to an isoleucine,
which is nonpolar and would lead to a net increase in attraction with
the nonpolar aromatic ring, and thus perhaps assist in the maturation
reaction by directing the tyrosine. When the sensors were expressed
in E. coli, we found that the T203I mutation provides
a sensor (crTC2.1) with brightness similar to that of the parent fluorophore;
both in E. coli and as isolated sensors, all three
CFPs provided similar mCitrine/CFP ratios. The isolated crTC2.1 showed
excitation and emission characteristics similar to those of the other
two sensors (Figures S5 and S6), albeit
with a small red-shift of 6 nm in both the excitation and emission
maxima, likely caused by the altered polarizability of the fluorophore
environment, which was previously seen for other 203 mutations in
GFP.28,29 All constructs display similar FRET efficiencies
of ∼10% as determined by linker cleavage (Figure S7). The small red shift does not increase the overlap
between donor emission and acceptor absorption sufficiently to provide
a measurable FRET efficiency increase. When we compare the relative
brightness of the cleaved CFPs with respect to direct excitation of
mCitrine, we find a mCitrine/CFP ratio of ∼0.9 for crTC, ∼1.1
for crGE, and ∼1.5 for crTC2.1. We name the new fluorescent
protein mTurquoise2.1.

We measured the maturation efficiency
of crTC2 and crTC2.1 in the
same manner as before for crGE (Figure 5). The maturation of the mCitrine was not affected
by the donor identity, while the maturation of mTurquoise2 was faster
than mCerulean3: mTurquoise2 matures an additional 20% after treatment
of the cells with chloramphenicol, which is equal to mCitrine, while
mCerulean3 matures an additional 40%. The fluorescence of mTurquoise2
increases somewhat after ∼100 min, possibly due to more complicated
maturation kinetics, as postulated before.13 It was recently reported that mTurquoise2 matures indeed faster
than mCerulean3,13 in line with our findings
here. When performing the same experiment with crTC2.1, we did not
observe a measurable increase in fluorescence for the mTurquoise2.1,
while mCitrine displayed a similar increase as before. Hence, the
mTurquoise2.1 has reached maximal maturity under constitutive expression,
indicative of a very fast maturation.

Figure 5 Chloramphenicol inhibition of (A) crTC2
and (B) crTC2.1 expression,
showing that replacement of mCerulean3 by mTurquoise2 or mTurquoise2.1
leads to more equal maturation rates between donor and acceptor. The
sensors were constitutively expressed from the T7 promoter in pRSET A in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS
grown in MOPS minimal medium at 30 °C, and chloramphenicol (200
μg/mL) was added at t = 0 at OD600 ≈ 0.1. The increase in fluorescence of both donor and acceptor
from maturation of immature protein was determined by fluorometry.
The data were normalized to t = 0. Representative
curves are shown; biological replicates are shown in Figure S2.

Next, we verified whether
the faster donor maturation would improve
the robustness of the sensors by relieving the dependence on the inducer
conditions. We added 1 mM IPTG to the sensors controlled by the T7
system in pRSET A. In these experiments, we lowered the expression
temperature to 20 °C, to prevent inclusion body formation at
high sensor concentrations. We observed that the relative increase
in fluorescence emission intensity of the cyan fluorescent proteins
upon addition of IPTG followed the order of maturation mCerulean3 <
mTurquoise2 < mTurquoise2.1 (Figure 6A), as shown by fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure S8). Also the FRET efficiencies upon IPTG
induction reflect the donor maturation rates: the mCerulean3-containing
sensor is highly dependent on the induction of the promoter, while
the mTurquoise2-based sensor only shows a marginal increase. The fastest-maturing
donor, mTurquoise2.1, shows a small decrease. This decrease may tentatively
be explained by a dependence on acceptor maturation, that now matures
more slowly. Hence, both the mTurquoise2 and the mTurquoise2.1 alleviate
most of the dependence on the expression conditions.

Figure 6 Induction of sensors
with IPTG affects sensors with mCerulean3,
but less so with mTurquoise2 and mTurquoise2.1, as measured by fluorescence
confocal microscopy. (A) Median emission intensities of the cyan fluorescent
proteins excited at 405 nm and monitored between 450 and 505 nm; the
data are normalized for comparison. The actual intensities for crTC2
and crTC2.1 are ∼10× higher than for crGE. (B) Comparison
of the FRET/CFP (780–505/450–505 nm, excited at 405
nm) ratio over time, showing a strong increase for crGE, a small increase
for crTC2, and a small decrease for crTC2.1. Error bars show error
in the linear fits of FRET versus CFP from over 100 cells.

A Model That Captures Donor Maturation Dependence
To
better understand the dependence on donor maturation, we constructed
a model that predicts the FRET/mCerulean3 ratio, taking into account
incomplete donor or acceptor maturation. We use eq 1 to quantify the effect of maturation on the
FRET ratio, which is derived in the Supporting Information. 1  In eq 1, macceptor and mdonor are the percentage matured acceptor and donor, respectively.
The equation takes into account donor bleed-through in the acceptor
channel, which is determined with purified mCerulean3, the FRET efficiency,
which was determined previously in living E. coli cells, and the acceptor cross-excitation, determined with purified
mCitrine. The maximum maturity that a purified sensor will reach is
∼80%.30 Therefore, the maturation
is scaled to this maximum; the model is calibrated with purified sensor.
The model allows facile assessment of the dependence of the ratiometric
FRET of the crGE at a given FRET efficiency on the maturation efficiency
of the donor and acceptor (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Effect of maturation of fluorescent proteins on FRET sensor
read-out
at 12 ± 2% FRET efficiency as obtained from eq 1.

This analysis suggests that a steep dependence of the ratiometric
FRET on the maturation of mCerulean3 occurs at maturation levels lower
than ∼30%. Under constitutive expression, ∼60% of the
maximum maturation is reached (as determined after chloramphenicol
inhibition of protein synthesis), and little effect of the maturation
of the donor on the FRET ratio is expected. Indeed, if acceptor cross-excitation
would not occur, probes with immature donors would not be detected,
reducing the dependence on donor maturation. Acceptor cross excitation
only becomes significant with a large excess of acceptor; this could
in principle occur with expression from an inducible promoter and
an acceptor that matures faster than the donor, as in the case of
mCerulean3. The faster-maturing fluorophores mTurquoise2 and mTurquoise2.1
would not reach such low levels of maturation under these conditions.
In contrast to the donor maturation, the FRET ratio linearly dependent
on the maturation of the acceptor; the higher the maturation, the
higher the FRET ratio. Obviously, FRET would not occur in sensors
without an acceptor, reducing the overall FRET efficiency. Hence,
this analysis shows that a model that includes acceptor cross excitation
can at least partially account for the FRET sensitivity with overexpression.

Discussion
Macromolecular crowding is an important parameter
governing the
biochemical organization inside living cells. Quantification of macromolecular
crowding, actually the excluded volume of a cell, with FRET probes
provides information on cell physiology that cannot be obtained with
other methods. Therefore, it is essential that the readouts are reliable.
We find that FRET ratios obtained with slow maturing donors suffer
from sensitivity to expression conditions. We can alleviate this dependence
by creating relatively constant sensor concentrations by constitutive
expression, which provides the time for the fluorescent proteins to
mature sufficiently. Alternatively, or additionally, sensor readouts
become more robust when the faster-maturing donors mTurquoise2 and
mTurquoise2.1 are used to avoid problems with cross-excitation.

It is not surprising that fluorescent protein maturation influences
FRET, and it has been stated previously on various occasions that
fast-maturing proteins are required, with an acceptor that matures
faster than the donor.1,30 This scenario is favored because
donor excitation in the absence of an acceptor abolishes FRET, while
the absence of a donor renders the sensor invisible, besides cross
excitation of the acceptor. Yet, to our knowledge a detailed assessment
of this effect on FRET has not been reported to date, and the connection
to the expression conditions has not been made. Our findings support
previous statements, and importantly, we provide insight into the
extent to which these statements hold and how artifacts can be minimized.

Besides the use of faster-maturing fluorescent proteins and constitutive
expression, additional spectral corrections would allow to account
for incomplete maturation by extracting the real FRET in the presence
of unequal number of acceptor and donor.9,10,31 These procedures require additional knowledge on
for example the bleed through, cross excitation, or extinction coefficients,
which can be obtained by measuring the individual fluorophores. Linear
unmixing of FRET with tandem constructs such as the crowding sensors
requires calibration with cells expressing either donor or acceptor,
and additional information on various spectral parameters from in vivo measurements.10 We find
that measuring FRET in small compartments such as the E. coli cytoplasm and subsequent spectral corrections is challenging due
to the introduction of significant noise, which originates from separate
excitations using multiple lasers and filters on small (femtoliter)
cell volumes. We find that if the fluorescent proteins are well folded
and have matured, as proposed by our methodology, such spectral corrections
are not required anymore.

Donor maturation plays less of a role
in donor-only FRET measurements.
Especially donor lifetime measurements would allow extraction of only
those sensors with intact donor and acceptor, albeit with a decreased
time resolution compared to sensitized emission and a more complicated
analysis procedure. Acceptor photobleaching is also not sensitive
to donor maturation but is dependent on acceptor maturation. Additionally,
acceptor photobleaching has a lower resolution in time and/or space.
Because ratiometric FRET measurements are straightforward to perform
and provide high spatiotemporal resolution, we chose to develop probes
and protocols for determination of changes in excluded volume with
this method rather than donor-only measurements.

Although we
find very slow maturation for the FRET donor in crGE,
this does not compromise the macromolecular crowding sensing ability
of the sensors under previously published conditions, which was under
constitutive expression. However, for future measurements to quantify
crowding, we strongly recommend to use either the crTC2 or crTC2.1
probes, especially when employing an inducible promoter. Determining
protein maturation is recommended for new growth conditions, combined
with fast-maturing proteins, constitutive expression conditions, and
spectral corrections of FRET when measuring larger volumes. These
findings also apply to other FRET sensors, especially where slower
maturing fluorescent proteins are used: Widely used orange/red fluorescent
proteins as acceptors mature generally slower than the green/yellow
donors,13 and the influence of immature
acceptors weighs in more heavily (Figure 6). Maturation times of fluorescent proteins
vary significantly between 7 and 500 min,13 and small mutations in the fluorescent proteins or growth conditions
could have a significant contribution to the maturation. The discovery
and further testing of the new donor mTurquoise2.1 will certainly
aid in the development of more robust FRET sensors, in combination
with new generations of fast-maturing acceptors such as Gamillus32 and Clover.33

Conclusion
FRET measurements require control over protein maturation in order
to increase the robustness of fluorescence-based sensors. We show
that artifacts arising from slow fluorescent protein maturation can
be substantially diminished by constitutive expression in both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells, which can also be achieved by incorporation
of faster-maturing donors. We therefore developed an improved version
of mTurquoise2 that matures faster but has a similar brightness compared
to the parent fluorophore. These findings provide insight into how
insufficient maturation plays a role in FRET and the necessity to
control for these artifacts when employing FRET sensors in living
cells.
