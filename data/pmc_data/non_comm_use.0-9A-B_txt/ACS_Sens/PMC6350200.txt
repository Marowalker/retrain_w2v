We have developed
a digital and multiplexed platform for the rapid
detection and telemonitoring of infections caused by Ebola and Marburg
filoviruses. The system includes a flow cell assay cartridge that
captures specific antibodies with microarrayed recombinant antigens
from all six species of filovirus, and a smartphone fluorescent reader
for high-performance interpretation of test results. Multiplexed viral
proteins, which are expandable to include greater numbers of probes,
were incorporated to obtain highest confidence results by cross-correlation,
and a custom smartphone application was developed for data analysis,
interpretation, and communication. The smartphone reader utilizes
an opto-electro-mechanical hardware attachment that snaps at the back
of a Motorola smartphone and provides a user interface to manage the
operation, acquire test results, and communicate with cloud service.
The application controls the hardware attachment to turn on LEDs and
digitally record the optically enhanced images. Assay processing time
is approximately 20 min for microliter amounts of blood, and test
results are digitally processed and displayed within 15 s. Furthermore,
a secure cloud service was developed for the telemonitoring of test
results generated by the smartphone readers in the field. Assay system
results were tested with sera from nonhuman primates that received
a live attenuated EBOV vaccine. This integrated system will provide
a rapid, reliable, and digital solution to prevent the rapid overwhelming
of medical systems and resources during EVD or MVD outbreaks. Further,
this disease-monitoring system will be useful in resource-limited
countries where there is a need for dispersed laboratory analysis
of recent or active infections.

==== Body
Healthcare
decisions that are
based on rapid, reliable, and digital data are a high priority measure
to prevent the inundation of medical systems during episodes of infectious
disease outbreaks. The largest Ebola disease outbreak to date occurred
in West Africa (2013–2016) and resulted in more than 11,200
deaths, with approximately 28,000 suspected cases in Guinea, Liberia,
and Sierra Leone.1 This recent and unanticipated
Ebola epidemic exposed many weaknesses in existing healthcare monitoring
and management systems.2 The regional and
international responses were compromised by inaccessible, incomplete,
and underutilized health information.3 Accessible
methods to rapidly monitor biological fluids for detection of suspected
infections will result in actionable data for professional healthcare
workers. These methods must not only provide accurate diagnosis by
untrained personnel, but also overcome the difficulties encountered
in the field, and storage of a high volume of confidential test records.
However, there are no truly portable diagnostic devices that can be
used by care providers with minimal training, especially those designed
for detecting Ebola and Marburg virus emergence within the community.4 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR),5,6 and antigen detection tests7−9 are performed and interpreted
only in the clinic, and thus rely on movement of patients or specimens
to operational laboratories. While PCR methodologies demonstrate excellent
sensitivity and specificity, data can only be obtained during the
first few days of viremia, using dedicated equipment and highly trained
personnel. Similarly, antigen detection tests7−9 are only useful
during the first few days of infection, and few assays are commercially
available. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) typically measure
antibody against only a single antigen from one species of filovirus,
usually Ebolavirus10 (EBOV). Further, ELISAs
are time-consuming and require costly instrumentation that is unwieldly
and trained personnel to perform, thus restricting use in resource-limited
countries.

Smartphones are finding increased use in biosensor
applications,
especially for optical readers.11 The camera,
computing power, and the communication capability to remotely report
results make smartphones an attractive choice for integration12−14 into diagnostic and surveillance assays. We previously reported15,16 the development of a filovirus protein microarray that used a desktop
laser scanner to characterize antibody responses from human and nonhuman
primate survivors of Ebola Viral (EVD) and Marburg Viral Diseases
(MVD). Here, we describe a highly portable filovirus disease detection
assay that is interfaced with a smartphone reader. The reader system
was used to analyze antibody binding to 12 essential antigens from
all six species of filoviruses that are arranged in a microarray on
a disposable microfluidic chip. Performance of the system prototype
was demonstrated with sera from nonhuman primates that were immunized
with a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus–Ebola Virus (rVSV-EBOV)
vaccine containing EBOV glycoprotein.17

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Recombinant
Filovirus Proteins
Full-length genes for
nucleoprotein (NP), and the glycoprotein (GP) mucin-like domain fragments
for the filovirus species of Reston (RESTV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Zaire
(EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and Taï Forest ebolavirus (TAFV), and
also Marburg marburgvirus (MARV), were cloned into pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO
vector (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and sequence verified.
All entry vector clones were shuttled into destination bacterial expression
vectors via LR reaction (LR Clonase II, Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Specifically, GP mucin open reading frames (ORF) were shuttled
into pDESTHisMBP (Addgene plasmid 11085) containing an N-terminal
HisMBP tag, while all NP ORFs were shuttled into pDEST17 (Life Technologies)
containing an N-terminal His tag. Expression of recombinant GP mucin
protein domains were accomplished with BL21-AI Escherichia
coli (Life Technologies) transformed with the pDEST17
constructs. Transformed bacterial were cultured in LB supplemented
with 0.1% glucose and 100 μg/mL, and induced at 0.4 OD (600
nm) with 0.8% l-arabinose (SIGMA) for 4 h at 30 °C.
The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 g, 10 min, 4 °C), and lysed using BPER lysing reagent (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) supplemented with 1 × Halt protease
and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail, EDTA-free (Thermo Scientific),
20 mg/mL lysozyme, and 75 U/mL DNase I (Thermo Scientific). The proteins
were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)
FPLC using 1 mL HisTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare Lifesciences, Pittsburgh,
PA, USA). Binding and washing steps were conducted with 25 mM HEPES,
140 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, pH 7.5, and for protein elution the
imidazole concentration was raised to 500 mM. Eluted proteins were
examined both by gel-electrophoresis and by mass spectrometry. Expression
of recombinant NP proteins were similarly expressed from transformed
BL21-AI E. coli bacteria, but due to
poor IMAC purification capability of these recombinant proteins, expression
conditions were optimized to form inclusion bodies. Induction was
done at 0.6 OD (600 nm) with 0.2% l-arabinose (SIGMA-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) overnight at 18 °C. Pelleting and lysis of
the bacteria were performed as described above. Inclusion bodies were
washed 2× in 140 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 to remove soluble
impurities, at which point >90% of remaining protein was recombinant
NP proteins. The proteins were then solubilized in 25 mM HEPES, 140
mM NaCl, 3 M urea, and refolded on the microarray surface. The purified
proteins were analyzed by Agilent Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). All purified proteins were stored at −20
°C in respective elution buffers, with glycerol added to a final
concentration of 25%. For quality control purposes and to validate
our assay design, printed microarrays were probed with a panel of
purified antibodies directed toward filovirus proteins. The panel
included anti-EBOV GP, anti-Sudan GP, anti-RESTV GP antibodies (IBT
Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The bound antibodies were detected
by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rabbit
IgG antibodies (Life Technologies). Arrays were scanned with Genepix
laser scanner (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed
using Genepix Pro 7 software as described previously.16

Prototype Cartridge
A prototype
cartridge (Figure 1) was assembled with
the following components. The base substrate was made up of cyclic
olefin copolymer (COC) with the following dimensions 25 × 25
× 1 mm3. A polyester backed 0.22 μm nitrocellulose
membrane (15 × 15 mm2) was attached (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) to the COC substrate (Figure 1a) using polyester double-sided diagnostic microfluidic
medical tape, coated with pressure sensitive acrylate adhesive (3M,
St. Paul, MN, USA). The recombinant proteins were diluted in PBS at
100 μg/mL concentration and printed on the nitrocellulose membrane
in a 4 × 8 array format by continuous flow microprinting (CFM,
Carterra, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The protein samples were delivered
to the surface by the printer using 48 microchannels, which allowed
the samples to cycle across the nitrocellulose surfaces bidirectionally
for 5 min. The spot size of the printed proteins were 400 μm
each with a pitch of 500 μm. An adhesive-backed acrylic cover
plate (Figure 1b) with
a dimension of 7 × 4 × 1 mm3 (Wainamics, Inc.,
Pleasanton, CA, USA) was pressed over the printed array to form a
flow cell with a volume of 100 μL (Figure 1b). The flow cell had one inlet and three
outlets to facilitate uniform flow across the membrane.

affixed on a COC slide; (b) an acrylic cover plate with dimensions
of 7 × 4 × 1 mm3 was pressed on tightly to form
a flow cell with a volume of 100 μL. The cartridge had one inlet
and three outlets for uniform flow across the microarray. The schematics
(c) show how the cartridge was assembled for the immunoassay.

Smartphone Reader
The smartphone reader consisted of
three main components: a Motorola Nexus 6 phone with an opto-electro-mechanical
hardware attachment that snaps at the back of the smartphone, a compartment
to house the prototype cartridge, and a custom application (App) to
run the assay. The hardware attachment was fabricated by 3D printing,
using fused deposition modeling and stereolithography technologies
(Stratasys Ltd., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). The 3D printed attachment
also had a custom-designed tray to hold the prototype cartridge (Figure 2). The Android App
provided the user interface to manage the operation, acquire test
results, and communicate with cloud service. It also controlled the
hardware attachment via flash pulses to turn on specific excitation
LEDs and digitally record optically enhanced assay images through
the emission filter. The smartphone, which was concealed within the
hardware attachment, served as the user interface, digital image acquisition
device, and system processer.

lens in panel (b); the back, front, and side views with the smartphone
are shown in panels (c), (d), and (e), respectively.

Detection of Ebola and Marburg Specific Antibodies
The printed microarray chips were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer
(Grace Bio-Laboratories, Bend, OR, USA), probed with serum diluted
at 1:150 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and washed three times.
Bound antibody was detected by incubation (1 h, RT) with Alexa Fluor
647 or 488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) diluted at 1 μg/mL. The microarrays were rinsed with purified
water, dried and scanned. A similar process was applied for the prototype
cartridge-based flow cell assay. The reagents were injected by pipetting
a volume of 100 μL through the inlet using PIPETMAN P200 (Gilson
Inc., Middleton, WI, USA) and incubated for 5 min (22 °C). The
waste was collected at the outlet with blotting paper.

Results
and Discussion
We previously showed that human antibody responses
to GP protein
were predominantly directed toward the polypeptide region of the highly
glycosylated mucin-like domain.15 Hence,
in this study only GP mucin proteins were produced for the microarray.
The recombinant proteins were physically characterized for molecular
size and purity by using a protein chip analyzer (Agilent Technologies).
The functional activity of the proteins was confirmed by probing with
a panel of purified antibodies directed toward filovirus proteins.
The EBOV GP mucin protein was specifically recognized by the rabbit
anti-EBOV GP antibodies (Supporting Information Figure S-1a). Similarly, RESTV GP mucin was also detected specifically
by mouse anti-RESTV GP antibodies (Figure S-1b). Minor cross-reactivity between MARV NP and BDBV NP was observed
for microarrays probed with rabbit anti-SUDV NP (Figure S-1c). Combined, binding data from these control antibodies
indicate that the filovirus microarrays were functional and that the
protein probes reacted specifically with the correct antibodies.

Alexa Fluor 350, 430, 488, 647, and Quantum Dot 525 fluorophores
were evaluated with the smartphone camera to obtain an optimal image
that was capable of differentiating between positive and negative
samples. The average Stokes shifts of these fluorophores ranged from
17 to 100 nm. Figure S-2 shows the excitation/emission
spectra of these fluorophores. Proteins conjugated to the fluorescent
tags were printed in a microarray format, and the fluorescent images
were scanned by a high-resolution laser scanner (Genepix Scanner 4400a)
and the smartphone camera (Figure S-3).
Although Alexa Flour 488 had smaller average Stokes shift (30 nm)
compared to other fluorophores tested, it produced the strongest signal
with the smartphone camera, and was selected for incorporation into
the assay.

The proteins were printed on a 15 × 15 mm2 polyester
backed nitrocellulose membrane fixed on a plastic (COC) support. Because
proteins bind irreversibly to nitrocellulose, no additional chemistry
was needed for attachment. An adhesive backed acrylic cover plate
was carefully pressed over the COC slide to seal the flow cell. The
cover plate had one inlet and three outlets for even flow of reagents
across the flow cell and membrane. We examined a cartridge prepared
with a microarray containing human IgG, rabbit IgG, and mouse IgGs.
Antihuman IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate was injected, and the fluorescent
intensity of the spots were measured by Genepix laser scanner. No
fluid leaks were found during the assay. Little or no binding was
observed with control IgGs (rabbit and mouse), whereas high binding
noted with human IgG (Figure S-4). Keeping
the cover plate in place reduced assay signals compared to signals
produced without the cover (Figure S-4c). This reduction may be attributed to the change in refractive index
created by air trapped between the cover and the microarray. An index
matching solution may be injected at the last step to overcome this
problem. The results demonstrated that immunoassays could be performed
successfully in the prototype cartridge.

An opto-electro-mechanical
hardware attachment (Figure 2) that snaps on the back of
a Motorola Nexus smartphone device was fabricated by 3D printing (Dimensions
Elite (FDM) and Object30 Pro (PolyJet), Stratasys Ltd.) with FDM (Fused
Deposition Modeling), and PolyJet technologies. The 3D model of the
device was constructed using computer aided design (CAD). The mechanical
body isolated the imaging environment and blocked the ambient light
entering the imaging area, which was important to obtain reproducible
results (Figure 2a).
A special tray held the prototype cartridge for imaging by the smartphone
camera. Two LEDs (LED Engin, San Jose, CA, USA) on each side of the
microarray served as fluorescent dye excitation sources (Figure 2b). The Android App
controlled all the steps involved in the operation of the reader device
including the acquisition and processing of the image (Figure S-5). The algorithm in the App enhanced
the captured images, based on the calibration and cutoff values, and
determined if spots present were positive or negative. The results
were displayed within 15 s after the image was taken by the smartphone.
The use of the dedicated smartphone camera was a critical part of
the reader development, but this also limited the ability to manipulate
captured images. The CMOS imaging sensors and firmware on smartphones
were typically designed and optimized for digital photography purposes.
Hence, these devices presented certain limitations for direct use
with the microfluidic assay. The digital images collected by the sensors
were automatically post-processed and compressed by the phone operating
system to provide the best-looking photos. Furthermore, the camera
settings had limited preset options that were designed to simplify
use. Therefore, total control over the imaging parameters and supporting
firmware on smartphone electronic products was not possible. The raw
images (i.e., unprocessed data collected by the imaging sensor) could
not be acquired on these devices, limiting the ability to control
the camera settings (e.g., ISO, aperture, and length of exposure).
Similarly, the precision and tolerances were low in the 3D fabrication
method used for the opto-electro-mechanical attachment, but were,
however, selected for this proof-of-concept study due to ease of production
and cost. Injection molding, which requires significant cost and time,
will be required for large-scale production.

A Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant
cloud service for telemonitoring the test results was also developed.
The cloud service was accessed through the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)-protected
web page. The primary function of this service was to report the test
results in a secure manner using the smartphone. To this end, we designed
the front-end interface with a third-party HIPAA-compliant database
provided by TrueVault, a service provider for small businesses. From
these readers, each user could register and securely access their
own cloud service test results that were stored in the TrueVault database.
Users had access to the database through a secure cloud Web site,
which displayed the test results as a table and as pins on Google
map. The cloud site also enabled study directors and select administrators
to upload calibration files to the specific end-user groups in the
field.

Protein microarrays were printed on the cartridge at
various X-Y coordinates to align
with the field
of view of the smartphone reader. The X-Y coordinates of 7.3 × 13.75 mm2 on the nitrocellulose
membrane provided the best results. Figure 3 shows the images of a sample array obtained
using with reference Genepix laser scanner as well as smartphone reader.
The array (Rows A and B) contained serial dilutions of goat anti-mouse
IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 printed in duplicates for measuring linear response.
Rows C and D were printed with a fixed concentration of goat anti-mouse
IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 and used for illumination correction and calibration.
The App utilized Row D elements for the correction of illumination
nonuniformity over the chip. Although the laser excitation provided
a stronger emission signal than the LED source in the smartphone reader
(Figure 3), there was
∼95% correlation between the results.

Figure 3 Comparison of microarray
fluorescent signals produced by the Genepix
laser scanner and by the smartphone camera. Serial dilutions of goat
anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 in duplicates was printed in Row A
and B. Fixed concentration of Goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488
was printed in Row C and D for image correction and calibration. Panel
(a) shows image outputs by the two readers. Panel (b) shows comparison
of normalized signal values in relative fluorescence units (RFU),
where each row was individually normalized. Panel (c) shows correlation
between the normalized RFUs of the two readers.

To test the performance of the integrated assay, we evaluated
antibodies
from nonhuman primates that were immunized with rVSV-EBOV, a vaccine
that protects against EBOV and has undergone human clinical trials.17,18 Sera from Cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) that received intramuscular injection of rVSV-EBOV were collected
before and 36 days after immunization. Filoviral and control proteins
were printed in a 4 × 8 microarray format. Rows A, B, and C contained
the filoviral proteins and Row D the calibration spots (Figure 4). The microarray included
GP mucin and NP proteins from all six species of filovirus family,
human IgG for positive control, buffer control, and goat anti-mouse
IgG-Alexa Flour 488 for smartphone reader calibration (spots D1, D3,
D6, and D8). The assay was completed in 20 min, and the fluorescent
intensities of the spots were measured with the smartphone reader
device. We analyzed six different samples that demonstrated quantitative
comparisons for vaccinated and prevaccinated NHP sera (spots B3 and
B4), as shown in Figure 4a. The relative signal values were calculated based on the local
background signal values. Spots B3 and B4 in Figure 4a were printed with EBOV-GP mucin domain
proteins. The two NHP prevaccinated sera showed no binding, whereas
the vaccinated sera samples produced strong fluorescent signals that
indicated recognition of the EBOV GP mucin proteins. The cross-sectional
intensity profiles of B3 and B4 spots are shown in Figure 4b. The signal intensities of
prevaccinated samples were significantly lower than the vaccinated
samples. Thus, the integrated smartphone reader system can clearly
distinguish between sera that contains anti-EBOV antibodies and nonvaccinated
controls. The microarray contained GP and NP proteins from all six
species for broad disease coverage, and high probe specificity was
demonstrated with anti-EBOV sera. For this proof-of-concept study,
we used sera from NHP vaccinated with a single species (EBOV) of filovirus;
however, we have previously used human sera exposed to three different
filoviral species and demonstrated the specificity and cross-reactivity.15 By including multiple probes from all six species
of filovirus family the specificity can be more precisely determined
than by using the single antigens. Antibody levels for filovirus infections
are usually described in arbitrary units that do not reference absolute
serum concentrations,19,20 making comparisons between methods
very difficult. Pathogen-specific IgG concentrations in serum are
typically in μM (μg/mL) or higher range and IgM levels,
which peak first and are important for disease diagnosis,21 may be a log lower (serum concentration of total
IgG 10–16 mg/mL and IgM 1–2 mg/mL). Although IgM was
not evaluated here, microarray technology platforms have sensitivities
in the low-to-mid picomolar (pM–ng/mL)22 range, and thus should be able to detect relevant antibodies in
disease sera. While the system described here detects only filovirus
specific IgG, future modifications may allow evaluation of IgM responses
to open up the possibility of diagnostic applications.

Figure 4 Evaluation of the smartphone
reader with NHPs vaccinated with rVSV-EBOV
vaccine. The microarray was printed with GP mucin proteins from BDBV
(A1, A2), MARV (A3, A4), RESTV (A5, A6), SUDV (A7, A8), TAFV (B1,
B2), and EBOV (B3, B4); NP proteins from BDBV (B5, B6), MARV (B7,
B8), RESTV (C1, C2), SUDV (C3, C4), TAFV (C5, C6), and EBOV (C7, C8).
Row D was printed with goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 as calibration
spots (D1, D3, D6, D8), positive controls of human IgG (D2, D4), and
negative controls of buffer (D5, D7). Sera from four vaccinated NHPs
and two controls (prevaccinated) were tested in the reader system.
Goat anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 was used for detection of antibodies
to microarray. The red windows show the location of EBOV-GP proteins
in the array (a). The cross-sectional intensity profiles of B3 and
B4 spots are shown in panel (b). The fluorescent signals (RFU) from
vaccinated NHP samples are higher than the preimmune NHP controls.

The main objective of this research
was to develop a point-of-care
platform which will monitor and remotely report data that reveal the
emergence and progression of infections caused by Ebola (EVD) and
the closely related Marburg (MVD) filoviruses. This goal was accomplished
by integrating a microfluidic microarray assay15 with a portable reader that capitalizes on the ease of
use and widespread availability of smartphones. The reader capitalizes
on widespread availability of smartphones and ease of use. The reader
utilizes the computational power of the built-in smartphone and software
to guide and monitor proper operation by untrained users especially
applicable to resource limited countries. An easy to follow, menu-driven
user guide is displayed on the smartphone application, and test results
obtained with the device are encrypted and wirelessly transmitted.
A HIPAA-compliant secure telemonitoring service provides test results
access to care personnel for rapid clinical assessment. The fluorescent-based
readout is highly sensitive, and the assay requires only 1 to 2 μL
of serum or plasma. The image capturing system employed to maintain
image quality, high fluorophore excitation and low background, probe
separation limits, and other factors determine the assay multiplexing
capacity. The current configuration will accommodate up to 60 individual
probes that are printed in 400-μm-diameter spots, and the number
of probes can be expanded with further refinements of the detection
system. Thus, the multiplexing capacity of the assay can be extended
to include additional proteins23−25 from viruses that may co-circulate
or co-infect along with filoviruses. For example, yellow fever, Lassa,
Rift valley fever, dengue, and other infections can detrimentally
affect the survival of EVD and MVD patients. Further, the infection
histories from such studies can be used for developing informed diagnosis
and understand epidemiology of EVD and MVD. Thus, the platform described
here will address important gaps in resources to monitor and remotely
report data that reveal the emergence and progression of infections
caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.

Conclusions
We
developed a simple, low cost, smartphone-based system for the
serological detection of Ebola or Marburg diseases in resource-limited
countries. The antibody detection system developed can monitor and
report data remotely from infections caused by all six species of
virus at the point of use, and will use only a drop of blood, such
as that required for a standard glucose analysis by diabetics. The
device will also be able to acquire antibody data from both symptomatic
and nonsymptomatic cases, and thus enable an additional application
and unmet need for disease surveillance. The next generation device
in development incorporates a cartridge design for plasma separation
to enable direct blood sampling, injection molded opto-electro-mechanical
component, and a universal scanner that can be combined with any cell
phone.
