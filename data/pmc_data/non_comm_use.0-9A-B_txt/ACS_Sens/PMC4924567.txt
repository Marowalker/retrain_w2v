15N nuclear spins of imidazole-15N2 were
hyperpolarized using NMR signal amplification by reversible
exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH).
A 15N NMR signal enhancement of ∼2000-fold at 9.4
T is reported using parahydrogen gas (∼50% para-) and ∼0.1
M imidazole-15N2 in methanol:aqueous buffer
(∼1:1). Proton binding to a 15N site of imidazole
occurs at physiological pH (pKa ∼
7.0), and the binding event changes the 15N isotropic chemical
shift by ∼30 ppm. These properties are ideal for in vivo pH
sensing. Additionally, imidazoles have low toxicity and are readily
incorporated into a wide range of biomolecules. 15N-Imidazole
SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization potentially enables pH sensing on scales
ranging from peptide and protein molecules to living organisms.

==== Body
Spectral sensing or imaging
of local pH variances in vivo has been of long-standing interest for
characterizing a host of pathological conditions, including various
cancers.1−6 For example, a variety of MR-based approaches using both exogenous
and endogenous agents (e.g., refs (6−17)) have been investigated as less invasive alternatives to using microelectrode
probes.6 However, sensitivity presents
a significant challenge to otherwise powerful MR-based methods due
to the typically low concentrations of probe molecules compared to
water in vivo.

One way to combat such MR sensitivity limitations
is hyperpolarization.
NMR hyperpolarization techniques significantly enhance nuclear spin
polarization (P), resulting in large gains in NMR
signal.18−20 One such approach is signal amplification by reversible
exchange (SABRE), a technique that relies on exchange of parahydrogen
(para-H2) and to-be-hyperpolarized substrate
molecules on a catalyst21−23—in solutions or in “neat”
liquids.24 Polarization of target nuclear
spins (e.g., 1H,2115N,25,26 or 31P27) occurs spontaneously when the applied static magnetic field BT is “matched” to the corresponding
spin–spin couplings between the nascent para-H2 hydride pair and the target nuclei (Figure 1a). Homonuclear (i.e., 1H) SABRE was demonstrated first21 using BT in the mT range; the approach
was later extended to heteronuclei (e.g., 15N, 31P, etc.) via SABRE in shield enabling alignment transfer to heteronuclei
(SABRE-SHEATH25) utilizing BT static fields in the μT range. Alternatives to
spontaneous SABRE or SABRE-SHEATH include radiofrequency irradiation
targeting level anti-crossings (LAC)28 and
low-irradiation generation of high tesla-SABRE (LIGHT-SABRE).29 These RF-based approaches are attractive because
they yield hyperpolarization directly in the magnet where detection
takes place. However, the spontaneous/static-field approaches currently
yield larger polarization levels, up to 10% P15N (corresponding to >30 000-fold signal enhancement
at 9.4 T). A key advantage of all SABRE hyperpolarization methods
is their fast polarization buildup—achieving high P levels in only a few seconds. Moreover, spontaneous SABRE and SABRE-SHEATH
are not instrumentally demanding and only require access to readily
produced para-H2 and a weak static magnetic
field. Furthermore, SABRE-SHEATH addresses a critical challenge faced
by all hyperpolarization techniques: Upon injection of hyperpolarized
(HP) material into a system of interest, signals usually decay rapidly,
with decay constants on the order of seconds up to a minute. However,
with SABRE-SHEATH, long-lived 15N sites can be HP with
relaxation time constants ranging from 1 min26 to 10 min.30 Furthermore, compared to 13C enrichment of leading 13C HP contrast agents
(e.g., pyruvate-1-13C31,32), spin labeling
with 15N uses relatively straightforward chemistry replacing
N-sites in N-heterocycles with 15N.26,33

Figure 1 (a)
Generalized scheme of SABRE and SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization
processes. (b) Chemical structure of the activated Ir-IMes hexacoordinate
complex after activation with H2. The complex undergoes
fast exchange with para-H2 and free imidazole-15N2, which enables spontaneous polarization transfer
from para-H2 (in the form of Ir-hydrides)
to 15N nuclei of imidazole-15N2 in
μT magnetic fields.25,26

The development of all hyperpolarization techniques has largely
been driven by their use in biomedicine to image organ function and
probe metabolic processes in vivo.20,31,34,35 While several translational
challenges of conventional SABRE have been addressed recently, i.e.,
demonstration of SABRE in aqueous media,36−38 and implementation
of heterogeneous SABRE catalysts,39,40 most SABRE-hyperpolarized
compounds studied to date have limited biological relevance (although
nicotinamide,21 pyrazinamide, and isoniazid41 have been demonstrated). Recently, 15N heterocycles have been shown to be potent for pH imaging.42 In this case, hyperpolarization was performed
with the well-established yet expensive dissolution-DNP (dynamic nuclear
polarization)43 modality and pH sensing
was achieved by detecting changes in 15N isotropic chemical
shifts, which are >90 ppm for the protonated and deprotonated states
of the 15N-heterocycles.42 As
a result, 15N isotropic chemical shifts of 15N-hyperpolarized probes may be ideal reporters of in vivo pH. This
approach has two key advantages compared to the current HP 13C-bicarbonate pH sensing approach.15 First,
in vivo 15N T1 is significantly
longer than that for 13C (e.g., ∼10 s for 13C bicarbonate15). Second, pH sensing using
bicarbonate requires measurement and detection of both 13C bicarbonate and its exchanging partner 13CO2 via spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)—a demanding approach with
respect to SNR, because the relative signal ratio of 13C bicarbonate and 13CO2 peaks must be measured
with good precision, whereas this approach only requires accurate
measurement of 15N frequency, which can be performed with
relatively low SNR.

A key challenge for in vivo pH sensing is
a relatively narrow pH
range for the extracellular compartments for most conditions of interest,
requiring that a given pH probe provide a wide dynamic range of signal
response over a relatively narrow range of pH values (i.e., ∼1.5
pH units). As a result, the pH sensor must have a pKa close to physiological pH of ∼7. Initial studies
of six-membered N-heterocycles (see Supporting Information Figure S1 and ref (42)) identified only one somewhat suitable candidate:
2,6-lutidine,42 with pKa ∼ 6.6. However, 2,6-lutidine is not readily amenable
to SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization.24 The
pKa of imidazole is ∼7.0—a
property that has already been exploited for in vivo tumor pH imaging
via proton detection without hyperpolarization.6,44 Therefore,
imidazole nitrogen-15 sites are excellent candidates for 15N HP pH sensing. Indeed, proton binding induces easily measured 15N chemical shifts of ∼30 ppm (Figure 2).45−47 Note that both 15N
sites have the same chemical shift in the deprotonated form because
of fast proton hopping between these two sites in aqueous media.45−47 In the protonated form, both 15N sites are equivalent
and have the same chemical shift. As a result, imidazole-15N2 is an excellent delivery vehicle, because its two 15N sites carry twice the hyperpolarization payload of (single-site)
pyridine derivatives.

Figure 2 (a) Molecular diagram of imidazole-15N2 protonation;
note that the effective molecular symmetry in unprotonated (due to
fast proton hopping between two 15N sites) and protonated
states results in the same 15N chemical shift of both sites.

produced via SABRE-SHEATH (BT < 0.1
μT, [catalyst] ∼ 4 mM); note the inset spectrum showing
the other HP enlarged resonances: the large changes (i.e., ≥10
ppm) of a 15N chemical shift of these species are caused
by the imidazole position in the hexacoordinate complex (e.g., equatorial
vs axial position, Figure 1b), binding state (e.g., free vs catalyst-bound states, Figure 1b),25,26 and protonation states.42 (e) 15N spectrum of a 15N signal reference. (f,g) SABRE-SHEATH
optimization of magnetic transfer field BT and temperature, respectively. All NMR spectra are recorded using
a 400 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer.

Here, 15N-SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization of imidazole-15N2 is demonstrated. Figure 2b shows the exchange process of imidazole-15N2 and para-H2 gas
on the activated Ir-IMes hexacoordinate complex of the most potent
SABRE hyperpolarization catalyst to date.23 As shown in Figure 2, 15N signal enhancement ε15N of ∼2000-fold
is detected on each of the two 15N sites in a methanol:aqueous
(pH ∼ 12) buffer (∼1:1) solution of ∼0.1 M substrate
utilizing only 50% para-H2 gas and the
hyperpolarization setup described previously.26 Note the broad appearance of the HP NMR line in pure methanol-d4 (Figure S3) owing
to intermediate proton chemical exchange between the two 15N sites described above; the 15N NMR line is no longer
broadened in aqueous solution (Figure 2d). The additional 15N HP resonances (seen
as narrow lines) are due to the presence of catalyst-bound 15N imidazoles (Figure 2d inset and Figure S3a)—which have
different pKa values, protonation states,
and proton exchange rates. If 100% para-H2 would have been utilized (vs ∼50% para-H2 utilized here), the enhancement would be effectively tripled
to ε15N ∼ 6000-fold, corresponding to P15N ∼ 2%. Temperature and BT(48) of the SABRE-SHEATH procedure
were optimized to achieve the largest enhancements under our conditions.
We note that unusually (for SABRE) high temperature (>340 K, Figure 2g) was found optimal
for 15N SABRE-SHEATH in the aqueous medium (Figure 2f,g).

These results represent the highest
payload (defined as the product
of 15N concentration and polarization) for any SABRE-hyperpolarized
compounds with the exception of 15N-nicotinamide (50 mM
and P15N ∼ 11% at ∼100% para-H2 limit), which was achieved in pure methanol-d4 using preactivation with pyridine,33 whereas here, 15N SABRE-SHEATH was
performed in an aqueous medium, which is known to provide lower enhancements
due to lower para-H2 solubility.37 A potential solution is a further significant
increase of para-H2 pressure (compared
to ∼6.5 atm used here), which could potentially enable significantly
larger polarization levels,24,26 e.g., P15N ∼ 10% or more. 15N T1 of imidazole-15N2 in methanol:aqueous
(pH ∼ 12) buffer (∼1:1) solution in the presence of
SABRE catalyst was 24 ± 1 s at 9.4 T, whereas further reduction
of methanol fraction (to an estimated value of <10% by volume)
resulted in a T1 increase to 86 ±
2 s (Figure S2) indicating that the in
vivo T1 (with the absence of both alcohol
and exchangeable catalyst) could potentially exceed 1 min.49 The 15N hyperpolarization lifetime
could also be further enhanced via long-lived spin states and the
use of lower magnetic fields.30

Motivated
by potential biomedical translation, SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization
of imidazole-15N2 in aqueous media was performed
at several different pH values (below and above the pKa, Figure 3) demonstrating that (i) 15N chemical shift of the HP
probe indeed changes by ∼30 ppm, and (ii) the 15N NMR resonances are sufficiently narrow to discriminate minute changes
in pH in the physiologically relevant range. Therefore, this HP molecular
probe can potentially enable in vivo pH sensing with an estimated
∼15 ppm range covering pH range 6.5 to 7.5, and it should provide
resolution of 0.1 unit of pH per 1.5 ppm of 15N shift.

Figure 3 15N NMR spectra of imidazole-15N2 hyperpolarized
via SABRE-SHEATH at various pH values (below and
above pKa) in aqueous solutions containing
<50% methanol. Note a minor shift of ∼2 ppm between resonances
shown in Figure 2c
(not color matched) and here due to temperature difference of ∼40
°C.

Conventional 1H-SABRE
of methanol-d4 solution yielded εH ∼ 50–100-fold
(Figure S3e), i.e., values lower than the
corresponding 15N enhancements (Figure S3a)—in agreement with previous 15N SABRE-SHEATH
studies of 15N-pyridine.26 Moreover, Figure S3d also shows in situ (or “high-field”)
SABRE 1H NMR spectroscopy of imidazole-15N2 recorded inside a 9.4 T spectrometer (the spectrum was recorded
approximately 2 s after para-H2 bubbling
(conducted at 9.4 T) was stopped—note (i) the partial SABRE
signal enhancement of one of the imidazole protons, manifested as
the signal with negative (emissive) phase—consistent with the
previously described “high-field” SABRE effect;50 and (ii) upfield 1H signals from
intermediate hydride species formed transiently during the catalyst
activation process.37 Taken together, the 15N SABRE-SHEATH and 1H SABRE results indicate that
imidazole-15N2 reversible exchange (and SABRE
in general) have the same key features as the most-studied SABRE substrate,
pyridine.

While d-DNP could in principle be employed for hyperpolarization
of imidazole-15N2, it is an instrumentationally
demanding and expensive hyperpolarization technique, and DNP hyperpolarization
processes for this class of compound typically require ∼2 h
of polarization build-up.4215N SABRE-SHEATH allows preparation of HP imidazole-15N2 (and potentially other imidazole-based biomolecules) in less
than a minute using a very simple experimental setup, paving the way
to pH sensing (imaging and localized spectroscopy) in vivo. Furthermore,
in combination with recent demonstrations of SABRE in aqueous media36−38 and in “neat” liquids,24 the presented work potentially enables the hyperpolarization of 15N-imidazole moieties for structural and functional studies
of peptides and proteins.51,52
