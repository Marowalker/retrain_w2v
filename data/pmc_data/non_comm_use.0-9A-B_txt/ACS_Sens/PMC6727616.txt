A fundamental limitation
of potentiometric ion sensors is their
relatively low sensitivity due to the logarithmic dependence between
potential and activity. Here we address this issue by exploring a
recently developed coulometric transduction method for solid-contact
ion-selective electrodes (SCISEs). Spin-coated thin-layer ion-selective
membranes are used to lower the membrane resistance and shorten the
response time of the SCISEs. When using coulometric transduction,
an optimized design of the K+-SCISE is able to detect a
concentration change of 5 μM at a concentration level of 5 mM,
corresponding to a 0.1% change in K+ activity. This indicates
that SCISEs can provide extremely high sensitivity when employing
coulometric transduction. Impedance measurements show that the coulometric
transduction process for the K+-SCISE is limited by diffusion
even for very thin ion-selective membranes. On the other hand, the
H+-SCISE shows a low impedance and a fast coulometric response
that is related to the high mobility of H+ in the H+-selective polymeric membrane as well as in the solid contact
layer. The coulometric transduction method was used to detect small
changes of pH in seawater and found to improve the sensitivity compared
to classical potentiometry. The coulometric method was briefly tested
also for determining activity changes of K+ in a serum
sample.

==== Body
Ion-selective electrodes (ISEs)
are cost-effective analytical devices that are used in various applications,
including clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, industrial
process analysis, agriculture, and food industry.1−3 ISEs are traditionally
used as potentiometric sensors, i.e., ion activity (and pH) is related
to the equilibrium potential of the ISE versus the reference electrode.
Under optimized conditions, ISEs show extremely low detection limits
(down to 10–11 mol/L)4 and a wide linear dynamic range. The durability of ISEs can be improved
by using a solid internal contact,5 such
as a conducting polymer.6 Emerging trends,
including personal health monitoring,7 will
increase the demand for durable solid-contact ISEs (SCISEs) with high
potential stability and high sensitivity.

A fundamental limitation
of potentiometric ISEs is their low sensitivity
due to the logarithmic dependence between potential and activity (Nernst
equation). For example, a potential difference of 1 mV means a 4%
change in ion activity for a monovalent ion (8% for a divalent ion).
High sensitivity and precision are particularly relevant, e.g., in
clinical analysis where the concentration intervals are extremely
narrow. For example, the reference interval for Na+ ion
concentrations in human serum is from 136 mM to 145 mM.8 In potentiometric measurements this corresponds
to a potential interval of only 1.65 mV (at 25 °C). Another example
is the precise measurement of pH in seawater.9

A coulometric signal transduction method allowing amplification
of the analytical signal of SCISEs was recently introduced.10,11 The coulometric transduction mechanism was characterized experimentally
for K+-SCISEs10−12 and theoretically for Cl–-SCISEs.13 In this coulometric
method, the potential between the SCISE and the reference electrode
is held constant and the current between the SCISE and the counter
electrode is measured.10,11 Any change in the activity of
the primary ion in solution gives a transient current signal between
the SCISE and the counter electrode. The current causes oxidation/reduction
of the solid-contact material and continues until the potential change
of the solid contact exactly compensates the initial potential change
at the ion-selective membrane/solution interface. Integration of the
current–time transient gives the charge that is proportional
to the potential change at the ion-selective membrane/solution interface
that originated from the change in activity of primary ion in solution.
The coulometric signal transduction method works specifically for
solid-contact ISEs and the amplification of the analytical signal
is proportional to the capacitance of the solid contact.10−12 Since the charge is linearly proportional to the potential change,
it means that the charge is proportional to the logarithm of ion activity,
in analogy with potentiometry. However, the advantage of coulometry
is that the charge is increased (amplified) by increasing the capacitance
of the solid contact.10−12 The practical usefulness of the coulometric method
initially suffered from a long response time, due to the relatively
high resistance of the ion-selective membrane.10,11 The membrane resistance was effectively lowered by increasing the
electrode area12 and by using a thin-layer
ion-selective membrane.13,14

In the present
work, the analytical performance of SCISEs selective
to K+ and pH are evaluated and compared by utilizing the
coulometric transduction method in combination with thin-layer ion-selective
membranes prepared by spin coating on top of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
serving as an ion-to-electron transducer. The results presented in
this work show that this type of SCISEs can be extremely sensitive
to changes in ion activity (concentration). This approach opens up
the possibility to detect minute changes in ion activity using SCISEs.
Furthermore, coulometric H+-SCISEs were evaluated for detecting
small pH changes in seawater and also tested for determining activity
changes of K+ in a control serum sample.

Experimental Section
Materials
Valinomycin, tridecylamine
(hydrogen ionophore
I), 4-nonadecylpyridine (hydrogen ionophore II), potassium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]borate
(KTFPB), potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate (KTpClPB), 2-nitrophenyl
octyl ether (o-NPOE), tetradodecylammonium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate
(ETH-500), bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC),
and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Fluka and were of Selectophore
purity grade. Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS, Mw ∼
70 000), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT, 97%), hydrogen chloride
(∼37%), potassium chloride (KCl) (≥99.5%), and sodium
chloride (NaCl) (≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized
water (ELGA Purelab Ultra) was used for all the experiments. Seawater
samples were collected at the seaside spot of Ruissalo, Turku, Finland
(by the coast of the Baltic Sea). Whatman filter paper (5893 blue ribbon ashless, D = 110 mm, No. 300210) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Control serum (Nortrol, REF 981043)
and ISE calibrators 2 and 3 (REF 984035) were obtained from Thermo
Fisher Scientific Oy.

Electrode Preparation
Glassy carbon
(GC) disk electrodes
mounted in PVC cylinders12 were used in
this work. The diameter of the GC disk electrode was 3 mm unless otherwise
stated in the text. All the GC electrodes were first polished with
sandpaper followed by diamond pastes with particle diameters of 15,
9, 3, and 1 μm, respectively, and finally with 0.3 μm
Al2O3 powder. Polished electrodes were ultrasonicated
for 5 min in ethanol and water baths, respectively. The aqueous polymerization
solution (0.01 M EDOT + 0.1 M NaPSS) was stirred overnight to ensure
complete dissolution of the monomer, and purged with N2 gas for 15 min to remove oxygen before deposition of the PEDOT(PSS)
films. Electropolymerization of the PEDOT(PSS) solid contact on the
GC electrode surface was done with an Autolab general purpose electrochemical
system (PGSTAT20, FRA2, AUTOLAB, Eco Chemie, B.V., The Netherlands)
in a conventional three electrode cell. The GC electrode was connected
as working electrode, a GC rod was used as counter electrode and a
Metrohm double junction Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl/0.1 M NaPSS was the reference
electrode. PEDOT(PSS) solid contacts were electrodeposited galvanostatically
on GC electrode surfaces by applying 0.2 mA/cm2 current
for a given time.15 The polymerization
times were varied to obtain polymerization charges of 1, 10, and 100
mC.

After electropolymerization, all the GC/PEDOT(PSS) electrodes
were dried overnight in air before covering them with an ion-selective
membrane (ISM). SCISEs with thin-layer ISM were prepared by spin-coating
the corresponding K+ or H+ selective membrane
cocktails onto electrodes that were placed vertically with the sensing
surface pointing upward in a holder on a rotator. The rotation speed
was 1500 rpm and a total of 1–3 drops of membrane cocktail
was added dropwise onto the rotating GC electrode surface (diameter
= 3 mm). First, one drop was added, and due to rotation, most of the
cocktail was swept away, so only a fraction of the drop remained on
the electrode surface. It was allowed to dry before adding the next
drop. After drying, the second drop was added, and so on. For larger
GC electrodes (diameter = 10 mm), the PEDOT(PSS) film was first covered
with 200 μL of the membrane cocktail, and then immediately the
spin-coater was switched on and set to reach the rotating speed 1500
rpm, so that excess cocktail was centrifuged away. The SCISEs with
conventional thick-layer membrane were prepared by drop-casting 50
μL of the membrane cocktail onto PEDOT(PSS), without any rotation
of the electrode. The composition of the K+-selective membrane
(dry weight = 15%) was 1 wt % valinomycin, 0.5 wt % KTFPB, 1 wt %
ETH-500, 65.3 wt % DOS, and 32.2 wt % PVC dissolved in THF. The composition
of H+-selective cocktail (dry weight = 15%) was 1 wt %
hydrogen selective ionophore II, 1 wt % KTpClPB, 68 wt % o-NPOE, and
30 wt % PVC dissolved in THF. The composition of the pH selective
membrane for seawater sample measurements was 1.1 wt % hydrogen ionophore
I, 0.3 wt % KTpClPB, 65.8 wt % o-NPOE, and 32.9 wt % PVC.16

The membranes were left to dry in air
overnight followed by an
overnight conditioning of the SCISEs in 0.01 M KCl (K+-SCISEs)
or 0.01 M HCl (H+-SCISEs) or 1 mM HCl with 1 mM NaHCO3(H+-SCISEs)16 before
the measurements. Electrodes were stored in their conditioning solutions
between the experiments.

Potentiometric and Chronoamperometric (Coulometric)
Measurement
Potentiometric calibrations were performed to
verify the proper
functioning of the K+-SCISEs and the H+-SCISEs
before chronoamperotric measurement. The potentiometric calibration
slopes were ca. 57 ± 2 mV/log a(K+) (−57 ± 2 mV/pH) within the response ranges studied in
this work. The linear response range was more narrow for very thin
ISMs, as discussed below.

Both potentiometric and chronoamperometric
(coulometric) calibrations were done using sequential dilutions of
primary ion solutions with constant background electrolyte to stabilize
the ionic strength. The starting solutions were 100 mL 0.01 M KCl
or 0.01 M HCl with 0.1 M NaCl as background. In a typical calibration,
34.2 mL of the solution was removed and replaced with background electrolyte
resulting in Δlog a(K+) or ΔpH
of 0.18 per dilution step, following the protocol from our earlier
work.12 A Metrohm double junction Ag/AgCl/3
M KCl/1.0 M LiAc was used as the reference electrode in all potentiometric
and chronoamperometric measurements.

To confirm the reversibility
of the electrode response, standard
addition was also used. The starting solution for K+-SCISEs
in the standard addition mode was 100 mL 0.005 M KCl with 0.1 M NaCl
as the constant ionic background. Additions of 0.1 M KCl (with 0.1
M NaCl background) were made to the starting solution with a micropipette.
The added volumes were 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 μL under constant
stirring of the solution. To reach equilibrium (current approaching
zero) between each addition, the required time intervals between additions
were 20–60 s.

Seawater samples were first filtered with
Whatman filter paper
to remove suspended particles as the samples were stored in the laboratory
before and between pH measurements. Coulometric and potentiometric
pH measurements were done in filtered seawater samples (volume = 50
mL) under constant stirring by standard addition of 0.1 mM HCl. The
added volumes were 20, 30, and 40 μL. The time intervals between
each addition were 100 and 120 s.

The coulometric method was
evaluated further and compared with
potentiometry by measuring small changes of K+ activity
in a control serum sample by using a K+-SCISE. The K+-SCISE was immersed in 5 mL of a control serum sample (CK+ = 4.4 mM) under constant stirring. Then,
360 μL of ISE calibrator 2 (CK+ =
6 mM) was added to obtain CK+ = 4.5 mM.
Subsequently, 400 μL of ISE calibrator 3 (CK+ = 3 mM) was added to to return back to CK+ = 4.4 mM. Both coulometric and potentiometric measurements
were performed. The time intervals between each addition were 2 min
(potentiometry) and 4 min (coulometry).

Electrochemical Impedance
Spectroscopy
Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for K+-SCISEs
and H+-SCISEs were done in 0.1 M KCl and 0.1 M HCl, respectively,
at the open circuit potential (OCP) using the same Autolab (with FRA)
described above, and a conventional three electrode cell. A Metrohm
single junction Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl was used as reference electrode and
a glassy carbon rod as the counter electrode. The frequency range
was 100 kHz–10 mHz and the excitation amplitude was 10 mV (RMS).

Results and Discussion
Thin-layer K+-selective
membranes were spin-coated on
top of the GC/PEDOT(PSS) solid contact in order to minimize the membrane
resistance, thereby facilitating the ion transfer through the thin
membrane and thus shortening the response time for K+-SC-ISEs
when applying the coulometric signal read-out method.12,13 Typical chronoamperometric and coulometric signal responses of K+-SCISEs with spin-coated thin-layer membranes are presented
in Figure. 1.

Figure 1 (a) Chronoamperograms
(solid line) and the corresponding cumulated
charge Q (dashed line) vs time for the K+-SCISEs with 4
mC PEDOT(PSS) solid contact spin-coated by 1 drop, 2 drops, and 3
drops of the K+-selective membrane cocktail. The starting
solution was 10–2 M KCl (0.1 M NaCl as constant
ionic background) and each of the 13 dilution steps correspond to
Δlog aK+ = 0.18 (first and second
dilution steps are shown). (b) Corresponding cumulated charge Q vs
log aK+ ranging from −2 to −4.37.

Figure 1a shows
an enlargement of the first and second dilution steps (Δlog aK+ = 0.18 per dilution step) of the chrononamperograms
and the cumulated charge vs time for K+-SCISEs with 4 mC
PEDOT(PSS) solid contact and different thickness of the spin-coated
thin-layer ISMs (1, 2, and 3 drops). The cumulated charge Q vs log aK+ obtained from the same experiment by integrating
the current is shown in Figure 1b. The results presented in Figure 1 show that the current response of the K+-SCISEs is faster for thinner ISMs, i.e., it depends on the
thickness even for such thin ISMs. Figure 1 also shows that the cumulated charge Q measured
during the first 5 dilution steps is the same for all the K+-SCISEs in the measurement, independent of the thickness of the ISM
(1, 2, or 3 drops). This shows that coulometry gives a highly reproducible
response, as long as the thickness (and thus the capacitance) of the
PEDOT(PSS) solid contact is constant (in this case the polymerization
charge = 4 mC). These results are consistent with the theoretical
expectations for a circuit containing a resistor and capacitor in
series15 and the theoretical model presented
recently.13

At lower concentrations
(log aK+ <
−3), a deviation from the linear charge response is observed
for the K+-SCISEs with the thinnest ISM prepared by spin-coating
of 1 drop of membrane cocktail. The same deviation from linearity
was observed also in potentiometric measurements in the case of very
thin spin-coated ISMs. The detection limit was clearly worse for very
thin spin-coated membrans than for “normal” thick membranes.
This may indicate incomplete membrane coverage or it may also be related
to a gradual exchange of K+ to Na+ in the bulk
of the ISM when approaching the selectivity limit of the membrane
(log KK,Na). Increasing the spin-coated membrane thickness
from 1 to 3 drops extended the Nernstian response to lower K+ concentrations both in potentiometry and in coulometry (Figure 1b). This seems to
be a fundamental limitation of very thin ISMs, which needs further
studies. Nevertheless, already 3 drops of spin-coated membrane extends
the linear range of the K+-SCISE to log aK+ < −4 under the experimental conditions used
here. The K+-SCISE with 3 drops of spin-coated thin-layer
ISM still shows a fast response and short equilibrium time compared
with the conventional drop-cast thick ISM (Figure 2a).

Figure 2 Chronoamperograms (solid line) and the corresponding
cumulated
charge Q (dashed line) vs time for (a) K+-SCISEs and (b)
H+-SCISEs with constant 1 mC PEDOT(PSS) solid contact and
either spin-coated thin-layer ISMs (3 drops) or drop-cast thick ISMs.
The starting solution is 100 mL 10–2 M KCl or 10–2 M HCl, respectively, containing 0.1 M NaCl as constant
ionic background. The first and second dilution steps (Δlog aK+ = 0.18 per dilution step) are shown.

Interestingly, the H+-SCISE shows a much faster amperometric
and coulometric response (Figure 2b) than the corresponding K+-SCISE (Figure 2a). The cumulated
charge obtained by integration of the current responses are shown
as dashed lines in Figure 2. When an equilibration time of 5 min between each dilution
(decrease in primary ion activity) was applied, relatively equal amounts
of charge were obtained for H+-SCISEs with both drop-cast
(thick) and spin-coated (thin) ISMs. On the contrary, the K+-SCISEs with a spin-coated (thin) ISM showed a comparatively larger
amount of charge than K+-SC-ISEs with a drop-cast (thick)
membrane. These results indicate that the transport of H+ through the bulk of the H+-selective ISM and the PEDOT(PSS)
solid contact is faster compared to the corresponding transport of
K+ in the K+-SCISE. The fast response (high
mobility of H+) in the H+-SCISE is interesting
when considering that the selective ion transport in ISMs is assumed
to take place in the form of ion–ionophore complexes and thus
should not be dramatically faster for H+ compared to K+.17 Could these results indicate
that free H+ contributes to ion transport in the H+-selective membrane? A definite answer cannot be given at
present, because in addition to ion transport in the ISM, ion transport
in PEDOT(PSS) also takes place. Furthermore, an additional ion-transfer
resistance at the PEDOT(PSS)/ISM interface may contribute to the overall
electrode resistance.18 So, the coulometric
response can be influenced by the rate and reversibility of the oxidation/reduction
of PEDOT as well as the rate and reversibility of ion transfer in
the bulk and at the interfaces of the SCISE.

Increasing the
thickness of the PEDOT(PSS) allows amplification
of the coulometric signal, as discussed earlier.11 The coulometric response of K+-SCISEs and H+-SCISEs with spin-coated thin-layer ISMs (2 drops) but with
two different thicknesses of the solid contact (1 mC and 10 mC PEDOT(PSS))
are compared in Figure 3. A thicker solid contact layer corresponds to a larger amount of
oxidizable/reducible material on the electrode surface, so a larger
amount of ions needs to be transferred to/from the PEDOT(PSS) layer
for a given activity (potential) change. Increase in the thickness
of the solid contact, i.e., increase in the redox capacitance of the
PEDOT(PSS) layer, increases the signal amplification but also requires
longer time to reach equilibrium, which is in good agreement with
our previous work.11 The results presented
in Figure 3a show that
the K+-SCISE with 10 mC solid contact and thin membrane
does not reach equilibrium within the time frame of the experiment.
Thus, a longer equilibrium time, even with the thin-layer ISM, would
be required for the K+-SCISE.

Figure 3 Chronoamperograms (solid
line) and the corresponding cumulated
charge (dash line) vs time for (a) K+-SCISEs and (b) H+-SCISEs with 1 mC and 10 mC PEDOT(PSS) as solid contact and
spin-coated (2 drops) ISMs. The starting solutions are 100 mL 10–2 M KCl and 10–2 M HCl, respectively,
containing 0.1 M NaCl as constant ionic background. The first and
second dilution steps (Δlog aK+ =
0.18 per dilution step) are shown.

The response time is illustrated further in Figure 4 showing the response to 10
successive dilution
steps for the K+-SCISEs and H+-SCISEs with 10
mC PEDOT(PSS) covered with spin-coated (3 drops) thin-layer ISMs.
Each dilution gives Δlog aK+ or
–ΔpH = 0.18. It can be seen that the current peak (following
the dilution) is much higher and sharper for the H+-SCISE
than the K+-SCISE (Figure 4a), while the cumulated charge is very similar for
both electrodes when adequate time for equilibration is also allowed
for the K+-SCISE (Figure 4b). The response of the H+-SCISEs is fast
and the cumulated charge curve resembles an ideal staircase, indicating
full equilibration and harvesting of the complete total charge of
the solid contact after each dilution step. When allowing for sufficient
equilibration after each change in the primary ion activity, both
the K+-SCISEs and the H+-SCISEs give very similar
cumulated charge, suggesting that the coulometric signal transduction
principle can be used as a general approach to measure and amplify
concentration changes with solid-contact ion-selective electrodes.
However, as discussed above, careful attention must be given to ensure
efficient ion transport processes within the entire SCISE.

and (b) the cumulated charge vs time for
K+-SCISEs and H+-SCISEs with 10 mC PEDOT(PSS)
solid contact and spin-coated (3 drops) ISM during sequential dilution
steps (Δlog aK+ or −ΔpH
= 0.18 per dilution step). The starting solution is 100 mL 10–2 M KCl or 10–2 M HCl, respectively,
containing 0.1 M NaCl as constant ionic background. The cumulated
charge Q vs log aK+ or −pH is shown
in the inset of Figure 4b.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were
performed for K+-SCISEs and H+-SCISEs with 10
mC PEDOT(PSS) as solid contact covered with spin-coated thin-layer
membranes (3 drops). The impedance spectra are shown in Figure 5. The impedance of the K+-SCISE shows a high-frequency semicircle (Figure 5a). The diameter of the semicircle
is ca. 65 kΩ and can be related to the bulk resistance of the
spin-coated thin-layer K+-selective membrane. The membrane
resistance (65 kΩ) is ca. 25 times lower compared to the resistance
(1.7 MΩ) of a drop-cast membrane with the same composition.12 This indicates that the thickness of the spin-coated
membranes used in this work is ca. 1–4 μm. The impedance
spectrum of the K+-SCISE also shows a low-frequency line
with an angle of ca. 45°, corresponding to a diffusion process.
This indicates that the transduction process of the K+-SCISE
is limited by diffusion. Such mass-transport limitations can certainly
be related to the longer response time for K+-SCISE in
comparison to H+-SCISE when utilizing the coulometric signal
readout method, which is in agreement with results discussed above.
On the contrary, the impedance spectrum of the H+-SCISE
does not show any diffusion line but an almost vertical capacitive
line at low frequencies (Figure 5b). Such a capacitive response at low frequencies can
be related to the redox capacitance of the PEDOT(PSS) solid contact.
In this case, the imaginary impedance at the lowest frequency (10
mHz) can be used to estimate the low frequency capacitance of PEDOT(PSS)
when coated with the thin-layer ion-selective membrane. The calculated
low frequency capacitance of H+-SCISEs with 10 mC solid
contact PEDOT(PSS) covered with thin-layer membrane is ca. 250 μF,
which is comparable to the capacitance of the same thickness of a
bare PEDOT(PSS) without membrane.14 This
implies that the redox capacitance of the PEDOT(PSS) solid contact
can be efficiently utilized in the case of the H+-SCISE
during coulometric transduction. Furthermore, the overall resistance
of the H+-SCISE (Figure 5b) is significantly lower than for the K+-SCISE (Figure 5a),
which is in agreement with the faster coulometric response of the
H+-SCISE.

Figure 5 Impedance spectra for (a) a K+-SCISE in 0.1
M KCl and
(b) a H+-SCISE in 0.1 M HCl. Both SCISEs had a 10 mC PEDOT(PSS)
solid contact covered with a spin-coated thin-layer ISM (3 drops).
The impedance measurements were done at OCP with 10 mV (RMS) perturbation
amplitude and 100 kHz to 10 mHz frequency range.

To further explore the limitations and possibilities related
to
the sensitivity of the coulometric method, a 100 mC PEDOT(PSS) solid
contact was electropolymerized on a large-area GC electrode (diameter
= 10 mm) and covered with a thin layer K+-selective ISM.
A large-area GC electrode and a high polymerization charge were used
in order to maximize the redox capacitance of PEDOT(PSS) and thus
the amplification of the coulometric signal, while a thin-layer ISM
still kept the electrode resistance sufficiently low for the K+-SCISE.12 The KCl concentration
was changed within a narrow concentration range by repeated additions
of small volumes (5–40 μL) of 0.1 M KCl (+0.1 M NaCl)
into a 100 mL solution of 5 mM KCl (+0.1 M NaCl). The smallest additions
(5 μL) gave a concentration increase of 5 μM at a concentration
level of 5 mM, corresponding to a 0.1% change in K+ activity.
The results of the coulometric sensitivity measurement using the large
area K+-SCISE during such standard additions are summarized
in Figure 6a-c.

Figure 6 Response of
a large-area K+-SCISE (diameter = 10 mm)
with 100 mC PEDOT(PSS) as solid contact and a spin-coated thin-layer
ISM. Additions of 0.1 M KCl (+0.1 M NaCl) were done (volumes shown
in the figure) to a 100 mL solution of 5 mM KCl + 0.1 M NaCl under
constant stirring: (a) current vs time, (b) charge vs time, and (c)
charge vs log aK+.

The current signal in Figure 6a contains a lot of noise, which is mainly due to the
continuous magnetic stirring of the solution, the spin-coated thin-layer
ISM, and the large electrode area. Interestingly, the high noise level
in the current vs time response (Figure 6a) was effectively eliminated when the current
was integrated over time to obtain the charge vs time response (Figure 6b). The resulting
charge vs log aK+ curve is close to linear
in the narrow concentration range studied (Figure 6c). As shown in the inset of Figure 6b, even a 0.1% change in K+ activity is detectable in the charge vs time curve, indicating
that the coulometric transduction method can be very sensitive. In
potentiometric measurements a 0.1% change in K+ activity
would correspond to a potential change of only 25 μV. For comparison,
it may be noted that, in conventional potentiometric measurements
using a Ca2+-ISE as indicator electrode and a Na+-ISE as reference electrode, the standard deviation of the background
noise was only 5 μV, while for a Ag+-ISE as indicator
electrode, the standard deviation of the background noise was 60 μV.19

The results shown in Figure 6 are very encouraging, suggesting
that the coulometric signal
transduction method can remarkably improve the sensitivity of ion
detection with solid-contact ISEs. It is also highly interesting that
the essential analytical information on a very noisy current signal
(Figure 6a) can be
obtained and visualized by simply integrating the current to obtain
the charge (Figure 6b).

The sensitivity of the coulometric transduction was evaluated
further
and compared with potentiometry by measuring small pH changes in seawater
that was collected by the coast of the Baltic Sea (Ruissalo, Turku,
Finland). Results obtained by potentiometry and coulometry are compared
in Figure 7. The potentiometric
signal contains some noise and the small pH changes following standard
additions are hardly visible in the potential–time curves of
both the glass pH electrode and the H+-SCISE (Figure 7a). The same standard
additions give clear signals when the coulometric transduction method
is used together with the same H+-SCISE (Figure 7b). The potentiometric as well
as the coulometric signals show some drift, which may be related,
e.g., to slow changes in pH of the seawater sample. During potentiometry,
both electrodes were measured simultaneously versus a common reference
electrode. Any potential drift in the electrodes and measurement system
that is not related to activity changes in the solution will inevitably
decrease the accuracy of the coulometric measurement. As in potentiometric
measurements, it is therefore important to ensure high stability of
the SCISE and reference electrode also in coulometric measurements.
Furthermore, any chemical redox reactions (e.g., due to O2) influencing the redox state of the solid contact (PEDOT) will give
a bias in the coulometric response. However, the comparison shown
in Figure 7 indicates
that the coulometric transduction method can improve the quality of
the signal from the pH sensor in seawater close to neutral pH, especially
if the drift can be eliminated. It should be emphasized further that
these results illustrate only the response to small changes in pH.
Determination of the actual pH value in seawater should be performed
in situ and was not attempted in this work.16

Figure 7 (a)
Potentiometric response of a pH-selective glass electrode (Metrohm)
and a H+-SCISE and (b) coulometric response of a H+-SCISE. The H+-SCISE was based on 10 mC PEDOT(PSS)
and drop cast ISM. Standard additions (20, 30, 40 μL) of 0.1
mM HCl were done to a seawater sample (50 mL) under constant stirring.

The coulometric method was briefly
studied also for determination
of K+ changes from 4.4 mM to 4.5 mM and back to 4.4 mM
in control serum samples using a K+-SCISE. Potentiometric
and coulometric measurement were done with the same single K+-SCISE based on 4 mC PEDOT(PSS) covered with a spin-coated thin-layer
K+-selective membrane (2 drops). The potentiometric, chronoamperometric,
and coulometric responses are shown in Figure 8. The potentiometric response is fast and
reversible but a potential drift is visible (Figure 8a). In addition, the chronomaperometric response
is reversible (Figure 8b) but a small negative current is present, which may originate from
a small potential drift also here. The coulometric signal (Figure 8c) is reversible
but distorted due to the bias current in the chronoamperometric signal.
These results show that the coulometric method works also in a complicated
sample matrix like serum and the results illustrate the effect of
potential drift. In order to fully utilize the advantages of signal
amplification offered by the coulometric method it will be important
to eliminate any potential drift of the SCISE (and reference electrode).

(b) chronoamperometric, and (c) coulometric
response of K+-SCISE measured in a control serum sample
matrix with K+ concentrations from 4.4 mM to 4.5 mM and
back to 4.4 mM, as indicated in the figure. The K+-SCISE
was with 4 mC PEDOT(PSS) as solid contact and a spin-coated thin-layer
ISM (2 drops).

Conclusion
A recently
developed coulometric transduction method for solid-contact
ISEs was evaluated by comparing K+-selective solid-contact
ISEs (K+-SCISEs) and pH-selective solid-contact ISEs (H+-SCISEs). Spin-coated ion-selective polymeric membranes were
used to lower the electrode resistance and thus shorten the response
time during coulometric transduction. Impedance measurements showed
that the transduction process for the K+-SCISE was limited
by diffusion even for thin spin-coated K+-selective membranes,
while the H+-SCISE showed a low impedance and a fast coulometric
response even for thicker membranes. This was related to rapid transport
of H+ in the H+-selective polymeric membrane
and solid contact. The shape of the impedance spectrum for solid-contact
ISEs correlated well with the coulometric response of the electrodes.
Hence, recording an impedance spectrum of the SCISE is an extremely
useful diagnostic tool to predict the performance and suitability
of the SCISE for coulometric transduction. When employing coulometric
transduction, the K+-SCISE was able to detect a 0.1% change
in K+ activity, which is quite remarkable. The results
obtained in this work show further that the coulometric transduction
method can be applied to detect small changes of pH in seawater and
small changes of K+ activity in serum. However, in order
to fully utilize the signal amplification offered by the coulometric
method it will be important to further minimize the potential drift
of the SCISE and reference electrode.
