Dynamic detection
of protein conformational changes at physiological
conditions on a minute amount of samples is immensely important for
understanding the structural determinants of protein function in health
and disease and to develop assays and diagnostics for protein misfolding
and protein aggregation diseases. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate
the capabilities of a mid-infrared plasmonic biosensor for real-time
and in situ protein secondary structure analysis in aqueous environment
at nanoscale. We present label-free ultrasensitive dynamic monitoring
of β-sheet to disordered conformational transitions in a monolayer
of the disease-related α-synuclein protein under varying stimulus
conditions. Our experiments show that the extracted secondary structure
signals from plasmonically enhanced amide I signatures in the protein
monolayer can be reliably and reproducibly acquired with second derivative
analysis for dynamic monitoring. Furthermore, by using a polymer layer
we show that our nanoplasmonic approach of extracting the frequency
components of vibrational signatures matches with the results attained
from gold-standard infrared transmission measurements. By facilitating
conformational analysis on small quantities of immobilized proteins
in response to external stimuli such as drugs, our plasmonic biosensor
could be used to introduce platforms for screening small molecule
modulators of protein misfolding and aggregation.

Innovative
surface-based optical
nanosensors offer novel means to investigate biomolecular processes
in a nondestructive and label-free manner and thus render exceptional
possibilities for biochemical analysis toward developing early detection
and diagnostics.1−3 In particular, nanoplasmonic sensors are attractive
chip-based platforms that provide strongly confined surface plasmon
excitations at the sensor interface to interact with thin layers of
bioanalytes for highly sensitive detection at molecular dimensions.4−7 Besides their extensive applications at visible and near-infrared
frequencies, engineered nanoplasmonic structures deliver unique possibilities
for biomolecular studies with ultrasensitive surface-enhanced infrared
absorption spectroscopy based on the distinct molecular vibrations
in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range.8−12 The mid-IR vibrational signatures of molecules correspond
to chemical bonds among their constituent elements and therefore enable
nondestructive and label-free characterization. By providing orders
of magnitude signal enhancement of these chemical fingerprints, engineered
metallic nanostructures represent promising systems for sensitive
detection of biomolecules and provide the means to overcome the limitations
of conventional infrared absorption spectroscopy.13−15 Molecular information
accessible with mid-IR spectroscopy is of great importance for analysis
of numerous biomolecules such as lipid membranes and proteins, with
significant implications in the biological and pharmaceutical industries.16,17

As the main components of biological processes, in-depth investigations
of proteins’ properties and structures are imperative to elucidate
their functions in health and disease.18,19 Mid-IR protein
signatures incorporate comprehensive information on protein secondary
structure in association with hydrogen bonding among their functional
groups including carboxylic acid and amine groups that can be affected
by environmental conditions.20−23 Developing sensitive tools that can provide insight
into the dynamics and conformational properties of proteins is crucial
for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying several systemic
and neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation.
These neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s (AD),
Parkinson’s (PD), and Huntington’s (HD) diseases to
name a few.24 Despite the fact that protein
misfolding is widely accepted as the primary triggering event in the
pathogenesis of such diseases, the structural changes associated with
the misfolding, aggregation, and formation of the pathological hallmarks
of the disease remain poorly understood.25 In general, the fibrillization process linked to neurodegeneration
follows a nucleation-dependent mechanism that includes formation of
partially folded intermediates of protein species. Nevertheless, their
roles in disease development are subject to debate, in part due to
limitations of conventional techniques in accessing dynamic conformational
characteristics of such unstable proteins during misfolding events
at physiological conditions. It is also noteworthy that current techniques
including circular dichroism and conventional Fourier transform IR
spectroscopy require large quantities of material and are not amenable
to switching different solutions for dynamic analysis.21,26 Therefore, enabling label-free, ultrasensitive, and real-time monitoring
of protein conformational transitions in response to different stimuli
with minimum sample preparation can provide the means to study metastable
folding/misfolding intermediates involved in diseases.

In this
work, we present real-time detection and monitoring of
secondary structural transitions in a protein monolayer in response
to stimuli in aqueous solution enabled by mid-IR plasmonic nanoantennas.
Our label-free biosensing platform constituted of gold nanoantenna
arrays provides localized surface plasmon resonances in the mid-IR
spectrum that are engineered for ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules
in their vicinity through enhanced vibrational fingerprints even in
the presence of water. We previously demonstrated the capabilities
of this platform for reliable detection of secondary structural signatures
from different proteins immobilized on nanoantennas at static conditions.27 Here, we demonstrate for the first time dynamic
in situ secondary structure investigations on a protein monolayer
by analyzing its plasmonically enhanced amide I fingerprint. As a
model system, we employed the Parkinson’s disease-related protein
α-synuclein (α-Syn). α-Syn, an intrinsically disordered
intracellular protein, is the primary component of intracellular β-sheet
aggregates that are characteristics of several neurodegenerative disorders
including dementia, PD, and Lewy Body dementia, also known as synucleinopathies.28 In addition to forming β-sheet-rich pathological
fibrils, α-Syn can also adopt α-helical structures when
bound to either vesicles or membranes.29,30 The β-sheet
or α-helical structures have previously been induced in this
protein using organic solvents.31 In our
experiments, we trigger dynamic conformational variations by modifying
the environmental conditions and introducing stimulus to induce reversible
secondary structural changes in the immobilized α-Syn monolayer.
The acquired amide I signature of the monolayer allows distinguishing
transformations and variations of different secondary structures in
the protein sample by decomposing this vibrational fingerprint to
its constituting components. We demonstrate the disappearance and
formation of β-sheet signatures upon titration of methanol (MeOH)
in real time. In addition, we show that exposing the immobilized α-Syn
to denaturing conditions restores the natively disordered structure
in the protein monolayer. Our approach enables monitoring distinct
β-sheet secondary structure changes in protein monolayers where
partial folding transitions can be observed. Moreover, we experimentally
extract the frequency of the spectral component from the vibrational
signature of a polymer layer using our nanoplasmonic approach as well
as infrared transmission and infrared reflection–absorption
spectroscopy. Our comparison confirms the agreement of the extracted
results for the frequency of the vibrational component from nanoplasmonic
substrate to that of conventional IR transmission measurement technique.
Thus, we establish the reliability of this approach as a new toolkit
for mid-IR protein secondary structure analysis that can provide complementary
information to those obtained through bulk measurements. Enabling
dynamic monitoring of protein conformational changes with our sensor
can be promising for studying protein secondary structure transitions
of invaluable proteins or protein complexes isolated from biological
samples that are obtained in minute quantities using multisteps laborious
protocols (e.g., protein aggregates isolated from patients’
brains or cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disorders).

Experimental Section
Nanofabrication and Fluidic
Device
Cleaned CaF2 substrates were spin coated
with methyl methacrylate (MMA)
and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) 495 MW resist double layer followed
by electron beam exposure using Vistec EBPG5000 at 100 kV. Metal nanoantenna
arrays of 100 μm × 100 μm were formed through a liftoff
process by evaporating a thin Cr adhesion layer and 100 nm of Au with
a Leybold Optics LAB 600H e-beam evaporator. The fabricated plasmonic
substrates were cleaned with O2 plasma treatment before
use. A fluidic device constituted of a three-layer PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane)
chamber is used to realize the fluidic channel, in/outlet flow channels
and top seal layer for bioexperiments. The nanoplasmonic substrate
is loaded on the flow channel and the device is mounted on the IR
microscope stage using a metallic clamp for sealing and measurements.
Thin PMMA coating at different thicknesses on gold and nanoplasmonic
surfaces is prepared by spin coating different dilutions of the polymer
in anisole at 6000 rpm and was calibrated using an ellipsometer (Sopra
GES 5E) to be used for measurements in dry conditions.

Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Measurements, Data Analysis,
and Numerical Simulation
A Bruker Vertex-80 V interferometer
equipped with a Globar infrared source and KBr beamsplitter (4000–400
cm–1), coupled to a Hyperion 3000 IR microscope
with Cassegrain objective (15×, NA = 0.4) and a liquid nitrogen
cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector (MCT) was used for the IR
measurements during the bioexperiments. The interferometer was kept
under vacuum while the microscope, including the sample stage, was
purged with CO2 and humidity filtered air. A linear polarizer
along the long axis of the nanoantenna arrays was used on the incident
light path. In the normal incident FTIR measurements the knife edge
apertures at the microscope were aligned to the area of the arrays,
i.e., 100 μm by 100 μm. An Au mirror was used for reference
measurement as background. All data acquisition was performed at resolution
of 4 cm–1 and 1024 scans co-added for each spectrum
which corresponds to 4 min acquisition time. Second derivative of
the logarithmic ratio of reflectance responses (A) were extracted using Savitzky-Golay smoothing with a polynomial
fitting on the acquired data within the amide I range. Commercial
software package of Lumerical FDTD Solutions was employed for field-profile
illustration in Figure 1b. A plane wave source was used for plasmonic excitation of the array
unit cell (L: 1850 nm, P: 2600 nm) with a linearly polarized electric
field along the antenna length. The dielectric values of gold and
water were from Palik library, whereas constant refractive index of n = 1.4 was used for CaF2 substrate.

monolayer in real time with the amide I conformational components

and increase of non β-sheet signals (e.g., disordered) can be
detected as a function of time.

Protein Preparation and Surface Functionalization
α-Syn
monomeric samples were produced in E.Coli with C-terminal sulfhydryl
groups (A140C) for immobilization via a PEG linker and were diluted
in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer with 150 mM NaCl (TBS) at pH 7.4 in stock
solution of 70 μM. Synthesized amino-(PEG)2-Maleimide
linker were prepared as explained in ref (27) to provide a hydrophilic environment and high
flexibility for the immobilized proteins. For Au surface functionalization
and ex situ immobilization of protein, a solution of 0.5 mM MHDA (16-Mercaptohexadecanoic
acid, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol is used to form the self-assembled-monolayer
(SAM) by overnight immersion, followed by activation of the carboxyl
groups with a solution of 0.05 M N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(sulfo-NHS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 0.1
M MES solution within 20 min. After a water rinse step, 100 μL
of 12 μM amino-(PEG)2-maleimide linker in TBS is
incubated on all antenna arrays within 45 min. Then, the substrate
is rinsed with buffer and incubated with the protein. Therefore, the
regions that undergo conformational transitions in the protein (residues
1–99) would remain exposed after immobilization. All experiments
and biochemical preparations were conducted at room temperature.

Results and Discussion
Real-Time Biosensing Principle
The
plasmonic sensor
is constituted of gold nanorod antenna arrays fabricated on IR-transparent
CaF2 substrates using electron beam lithography. Figure 1a shows an SEM image
of one of the arrays on the plasmonic substrate. The resonance peak
tuning of mid-IR nanorods follows a linear relation with the antenna
aspect ratio and the effective refractive index of their surrounding
environment. Therefore, by designing the length (L) of the antennas
and their period (P) in the array the plasmonic resonance can be engineered
for collective excitation to probe different vibrational signatures
in mid-IR range when the antennas are illuminated by polarized light
along their long axis.32,33 Accordingly, we design the antenna
arrays for resonances close to 1600–1700 cm–1 in aqueous environment.20−22 Here, the width (W) and height
(H) of antennas are kept at constant values of 200 and 100 nm, respectively,
while the size of each array is 100 μm by 100 μm. Mid-IR
plasmonic nanorod arrays can provide optimum resonance bandwidths
for detecting the amide I signature encompassing protein conformational
information. Their dimensions for operation in aqueous media are suitable
for employing conventional nanofabrication techniques to reliably
and reproducibly manufacture the nanoplasmonic substrates, with potentials
for wafer-scale and low-cost production using emerging fabrication
methods.27,34Figure 1b shows the antenna hot-spots associated with the plasmonic
resonance excitation observed in the field-profile (intensity enhancement)
at the top surface of an antenna in an array (L: 1850 nm and P: 2600
nm) in water that is obtained with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
simulation (at 1700 cm–1). In order to enable measurement
in aqueous solution, the nanoplasmonic substrate is mounted on a microfluidic
device and used in plasmonic internal reflection measurement configuration.14,35 In this scheme, the reflection response of the antenna array is
measured from the backside of the IR-transparent CaF2 substrate
as illustrated in Figure 1c, while the solution surrounding the antennas in the fluidic
channel can be changed using a flow system with a syringe pump. The
overlap of the excited plasmonic hotspots in the vicinity of the nanorod
tip-ends with the immobilized protein monolayer, shown schematically
in the right panel of Figure 1d, results in ultrasensitive surface enhanced IR absorption
spectroscopic detection. The initial reflectance response of the antenna
array (R) and its reflectance after immobilizing
protein (Rwith protein) are used
to extract the vibrational signatures of the monolayer using the logarithmic
ratio of the responses, A = −log(Rwith protein/Rno protein), to ensure the compensation of the variations in the refractive
index and absorption signals of the surrounding background. By means
of second-derivative analysis on the acquired amide I signature of
protein monolayer on the antenna array, we obtain information on its
secondary structure composition through its constituting spectral
components, as schematically depicted in the left panel of Figure 1d where distinct
β-sheet component can be differentiated from that of disordered
conformation, helices or non-β strands.20 In order to demonstrate dynamic sensing, secondary structure of
α-Syn monolayer immobilized on antennas is monitored in real
time in different solutions. In this work, we are mainly monitoring
the distinct strong β-sheet IR signals from α-Syn monolayer
that are detectable in its amide I component peaks at ∼1615–1640
cm–1 (red arrow in Figure 1d) and its disordered signals at ∼1645–1660
cm–1 (blue arrow in Figure 1d) overlapping with that of helices at different
conditions. In addition, weaker β-sheet signatures at ∼1680–1695
cm–1 and that of non β-sheet strands (including
turns and loops) at ∼1660–1690 cm–1 are also detected in the presented data and can be used for evaluation.
We flow varying MeOH concentration in the buffer through the fluidic
channel and detect the secondary structural variations of the immobilized
protein in real time as illustrated in Figure 1e. While the conformational change is induced
by introducing different concentration of MeOH, the gradual variations
between β-sheet and disordered signals of the amide I components
can be detected dynamically.

Real-Time Secondary Structure Detection on
Protein Monolayer
To demonstrate real-time secondary structure
monitoring of a protein
monolayer in aqueous solution, we investigated the secondary changes
on α-Syn protein in interaction with MeOH. Stimulating secondary
structure transitions in α-Syn monolayer is achieved by introduction
and removal of MeOH (Figure 1c–e), which can induce the formation of distinguishable
β-sheet conformation at high percentage (e.g., 40%) of MeOH
compared to the native intrinsically disordered structure (see bulk
CD measurement results in Figure S1 and
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information (SI)). We employ thiol
surface chemistry to immobilize α-Syn monolayer on the gold
nanoantennas using a maleimide linker in TBS. First, a COOH-functional
alkanethiol SAM is formed on gold by 12 hours incubation in a solution
of MHDA. Figure S3a shows the reflectance
response of a nanorods array (L: 1850 nm and P: 2600 nm) with SAM
at different percentages of MeOH in buffer that is used as reference.
The effect of water absorption signature (Figure S3b) from the aqueous background overlapping the amide I fingerprint
is observed while the solution is changed from 40% to 0% MeOH in TBS
with the fluidic device. In addition, the methanol signatures in the
∼1400–1500 cm–1 range disappear in
the reflectance responses upon decrease in MeOH concentration. The
antenna design according to the slight blue shift of the far-field
resonance peak is compared to its plasmonic near-field peak to provide
maximum field enhancement at the amide I range.13 Therefore, as a rule of thumb, by using the antenna array
with reflectance peak tuned toward the upper range of the amide I
signature, we can provide optimum enhancement. As previously shown,
approximately 3 orders of magnitude signal enhancement has been achieved
with similar mid-IR nanorod antennas.14,27 Next, ex situ
immobilization of protein via linker is performed using the surface
functionalization steps explained in the Experimental
Section. Here, we use a 12 μM α-Syn stock solution
that is freshly prepared in 40% MeOH in TBS to immobilize the proteins
on the gold antennas within an hour of incubation after surface functionalization.
Finally, the substrate is rinsed to remove any excessive unbound protein
and is measured in the fluidic device with the corresponding solution.
The reflectance response of the antenna array with protein is measured
at different conditions where the MeOH percentage is changed from
40% to 0% in sequential steps throughout the experiment as shown in Figure 2a and explained in
the following. To extract the secondary structure components of α-Syn
within its amide I signature at each step, a second derivative of
the acquired data with the logarithmic ratio of the reflectance responses
(A) is obtained using the reference measurement and
is presented in Figure 2b.22 First, the reflectance response is
measured while the protein is initially exposed to 40% MeOH in TBS
in the fluidic channel after 1 h post-incubation wait (black curve
in Figure 2a). Strong
β-sheet signatures are observed in the ∼1615–1640
cm–1 range with weaker signatures of this secondary
structure at ∼1685–1695 cm–1 range
(black curve in Figure 2b). We then flow reduced concentration of MeOH and acquire the reflectance
response at every 15 min as presented in Figure 2a. The flow rate used for each step is 250
μL/min during 6 min and the flow is stopped for 5 min before
each reflectance measurement while the protein monolayer is exposed
to the corresponding specified solution. Acquired results presented
in Figure 2b indicate
that the α-Syn monolayer, which was initially prepared in 40%
MeOH in TBS and immobilized under the same buffer condition, maintains
its distinct β-sheet signature after immobilization and initial
measurement in the same solution. Upon gradual removal of MeOH in
the TBS surrounding the protein layer, the β-sheet signature
weakens as expected while the component signature of disordered increases.
However, once the methanol is completely removed from the buffer (0%
MeOH in TBS, red curve in Figure 2a,b), the protein layer still incorporates some weak
residual β-sheet signature at lower wavenumbers when measured
after limited rest in TBS. In addition, more distinct features corresponding
to non-β-sheet strands (turns and loops) are observed at this
state (∼1660–1685 cm–1). Integration
methods can be applied to present these conformational dynamics and
variations as shown in Figure S4.

structure detection and monitoring on immobilized
α-Syn monolayer. (a) Reflectance response of antenna arrays
(L: 1850 nm and P: 2600 nm) with protein monolayer. The methanol content
in TBS is gradually changed from 40% to 0% over a period of 120 min
in nine steps while the reflectance is acquired at every 15 min. The
amide I vibration range (1600–1700 cm–1)
is marked by dashed lines. The schematic inset illustrates the plasmonic
internal reflection measurement configuration that is employed with
the integrated fluidic device. (b) Second derivative analysis of acquired
amide I signature for the α-Syn monolayer during buffer change
steps calculated from the logarithmic ratio of reflectance responses

amide I fingerprint weakens upon gradual decrease of MeOH concentration
while the disordered signature increases. The red arrow indicates
the approximate range of β-sheet component.

Analysis of Protein Secondary Structure Response to Stimuli
Our biosensor integrated with microfluidics facilitates introducing
and switching between different solutions condition, and therefore
provides great flexibility in modulating the structure of the immobilized
proteins. In contrast to the static measurements with conventional
bulk measurement methods such as circular dichroism spectroscopy,
our approach can enable dynamic and comparative monitoring of reversible
and irreversible conformational changes induced by stimuli. To demonstrate
such capabilities, we examine the secondary structure changes of α-Syn
monolayer in two different experiments in which the influence of a
denaturing agent is investigated when it is included within a full
cycle of MeOH concentration change, as presented in Figure 3. Both experiments are conducted
using identical arrays (L: 1850 nm and P: 2600 nm) and immobilization
procedures as presented before. The gradual concentration changes
of MeOH in TBS from 40% to 0% and back to 40% are presented for decreasing
(i.e., (i)) and increasing concentration (i.e., (ii)) parts for each
of the two experiments. In the first experiment (Figure 3a), the α-Syn monolayer
is exposed to a high flow of TBS after methanol removal before being
measured again in buffer at the end of part (i), whereas in the second
experiment (Figure 3b) it is exposed to a denaturing agent at this step before being
measured again in TBS as explained below.

Figure 3 Secondary structure analysis
on α-Syn monolayer with nanoplasmonics
during solution change cycles in two experiments with and without
denaturing agent (GdnHCl) and the corresponding schematic illustrations.
(a) Immobilized α-Syn secondary structural changes induced with
varying MeOH concentration only: (i) response to MeOH concentration
change from 40% to 0% in TBS (by 120 min). At the final stage, a high
flow of TBS is used before measuring the response at TBS again (i.e.,
135 min). The residual β-sheet signature is detected as depicted
in the top illustration. (ii) Response to increase of MeOH concentration
back to 40% in TBS (i.e., at 255 min). At the final stage the monolayer
is measured after waiting 45 min in 40% MeOH in TBS at the end of
a full cycle. (b) Immobilized α-Syn secondary structural changes
induced with methanol concentration and denaturant: (i) response to
the change from 40% MeOH in TBS to TBS within 120 min. At the final
stage in part (i), GdnHCl in TBS is introduced in the fluidic device
for 2.5 min before changing the solution back to TBS and measuring
the monolayer again (i.e., 135 min). (ii) Response to increase of
MeOH concentration back to 40% (i.e., at 255 min). At the final stage
the monolayer is measured after waiting 45 min in 40% MeOH in TBS.
The last curves in each part (i) are shown again in their corresponding
next parts (i.e., (ii)) for easier monitoring of both experiments
in (a) and (b).

In Figure 3a at
the beginning of the first experiment, we similarly observe the initial
decrease in β-sheet signature when MeOH concentration is decreased
from 40% to 0% within 120 min in part (i) as schematically illustrated.
At this step, we employ a TBS flow of 500 μL/min for 2.5 min
which is then paused before measuring the protein again in TBS (i.e,
at 135 min) shown with the last red curve in part (i) of Figure 3a. The results indicate
that the weak residual β-sheet signature of the immobilized
protein layer does not disappear even when it is exposed to TBS for
more than 15 min. Next, we continue the experiment by progressively
increasing the MeOH concentration from 0% to 40% in part (ii) of Figure 3a with similar flow
rates and timing as in previous experiments to complete a full cycle
of buffer change. Here, the first red curve in part (ii) is the last
red curve in part (i) corresponding to protein at TBS with no MeOH.
Comparing the β-sheet signature of the α-Syn monolayer
in part (i) and (ii) for the same MeOH concentration indicate significantly
lower β-sheet signals during increasing methanol percentage
as opposed to the previous steps with decreasing methanol. This observation
could be as a result of several factors such as immobilization of
the protein on the gold surface that could affect the formation of
β-sheet, the protein’s previous conformational state
at each step or the time needed for immobilized proteins to react
to the environmental changes. At the final step in this cycle, the
black curve in part (ii), we measure the response of the protein layer
in 40% MeOH after waiting an additional 45 min in the solution with
no flow. Here, we observe a slight increase in the β-sheet signature
when the α-Syn layer is exposed to the MeOH solution for longer
time.

Similarly, we performed the second experiment with identical
timing
for the experimental steps but use the chemical denaturant guanidine
hydrochloride (GdnHCl) to unfold the protein. The results for this
experiment are presented in Figure 3b where in part (i) the MeOH concentration is similarly
reduced from 40% to 0%. The initial results in part (i) reproduce
our previous experiments in Figure 3a and Figure 2b. In the final steps of part (i) when TBS with no MeOH is
in the flow channel, we employ a flow rinse step with 6 M GdnHCl in
TBS for 2.5 min followed by TBS flow before measuring the protein
in buffer again (at 135 min). As schematically illustrated, the denaturant
properties of GdnHCl should remove any residual structure in the proteins
and result in random coiled structure of α-Syn layer after its
exposure which is observed in the last red curve in part (i) of Figure 3b measured in TBS.
Continuing the rest of this experiment analogous to the previous one
results in observing a similar trend. In addition, the two experiments
show that the residual β-sheet conformation at the final step
in part (i) (Figure 3a) contributes to slightly higher final β-sheet signatures
when comparing the final results of part (ii) in Figure 3a and b. This is in line with
the observation that after total removal of the MeOH and its reintroduction,
the protein layer does not form as much β-sheet compared to
its initial state. In addition, we conducted an experiment with an
identical array and preparation steps in which we initially immobilized
α-Syn protein prepared in TBS on the antenna surface. The results
for this test are shown in Figure S5 where
after immobilization and measurement of the protein monolayer at its
initial state the solution is changed by directly flowing 40% MeOH
in TBS with the fluidic device. In this experiment the appearance
of β-sheet signatures due to presence of high percentage of
MeOH in the buffer is dramatically slower compared to the previous
tests. Moreover, the weak β-sheet signature observed in the
protein monolayer after 4 h of exposure to 40% MeOH appears at slightly
higher wavenumbers (∼5 cm–1) compared to
that of the previous experiments. These results can indicate that
the protein conformational response to stimuli and environmental changes
is influenced by immobilization and its initial conformational state
in addition to the timing of introducing such triggers.

Comparison
of Nanoplasmonic Method with Infrared Transmission
and Grazing Incidence Reflection
The exact peak frequency
of each secondary structural component within the amide I vibrational
band is important for interpreting protein conformational states and
analyzing different proteins.20,22 Therefore, we validated
the results extracted from our new nanoplasmonics approach with two
conventional IR spectroscopy techniques, namely, infrared transmission
and grazing incidence reflection (GIR) configurations. Transmission
measurements are the general method for evaluating thick films and
large sample volumes whereas GIR measurements enable infrared reflection–absorption
spectroscopy of thin films on gold surface and therefore resemble
our approach.21,36 For this comparison, we use PMMA
(poly(methyl methacrylate)) polymer and experimentally analyzed its
distinct carbonyl signature with these three techniques without any
overlapping background signals in dry condition. The schematic illustrations
in Figure 4a depict
the two different measurements for transmission and GIR configuration
both performed with an IR microscope. For transmission measurement,
we dropcast a thick PMMA (950 MW) layer on a clean CaF2 substrate and measure its transmission after 2 min drying on a hot
plate. The resulting absorbance from this measurement is shown in Figure 4b with the green
curve. For GIR measurements, we used a grazing incidence objective
with 52–84° angle of incidence. In this case, the thin
PMMA films on gold substrates are prepared with spin coating. Two
different thickness of 5 and 10 nm are analyzed, representing typical
thicknesses of immobilized protein layers in bioassays. The thin film
signatures are extracted with GIR measurements using α = −log(Rwith film/Rbare) and are presented in Figure 4b. The corresponding results show the different absorption
signals of the PMMA layers with the two measurement configurations.
Here, the strength of the absorbance is not relevant for comparing
the resulted peak frequency of an acquired vibrational component.
Multiple vibrational signatures of the PMMA layer can be observed
in Figure 4b. Notably,
the distinct CO vibration without any overlapping background signals
allows experimental assessment for the exact frequency of this individual
component while avoiding variations due to presence of any neighboring
spectral components. In Figure 4c, we compare the acquired frequency of CO vibration from
the two different measurement approaches by using the second derivative
analysis within this vibrational band. Here, we observe the well-known
slight blue shift between the transmission (∼1732 cm–1) and GIR (∼1738 cm–1) results which corresponds
to anomalous dispersion of the refractive index as shown in literature.36,37 Next, we evaluate our nanoplasmonic approach by fabricating two
sets of antenna arrays with varying L and P in order to tune the resonance
peak throughout the carbonyl vibration and provide different full
width half maximums (fwhm) of resonances. The reflectance responses
are shown in Figure 5b, for bare arrays. The antenna designs are L: 2000, 2050, 2100,
and 2150 nm with P: 3 μm (solid curves) and L: 2000, 2050, 2100,
2150, and 2200 nm with P: 2.5 μm (dashed curves). The gray shaded
strip indicates the approximate frequency of the PMMA carbonyl signature.
By sweeping the peak and bandwidth of resonances, we can provide a
comprehensive investigation on the influence of resonance excitation
and coupling conditions for detecting vibrational components with
our nanoplasmonic method in relation to other IR techniques. Two identical
substrates were spin coated with thin PMMA layers similar to that
of GIR samples (i.e., 5 and 10 nm) and the reflectance response was
measured as illustrated in Figure 5a. The reflectance spectra are used to extract the
frequency of vibrational signature with second derivative analysis
of the logarithmic ratio of the reflectance responses (A) before and after coating as introduced previously. The acquired
frequency results of the carbonyl component for the two PMMA thicknesses
are presented in Figure 5c as data points corresponding to the peak of the extracted vibrational
component. The dashed lines correspond to results extracted from Figure 4c using infrared
transmission (green) and grazing incident reflection (black) measurements. Figure S6 shows the second derivative analysis
for some of the arrays from which the data points in Figure 5c are retrieved as the peak
of the vibrational component. Even with the detuning of the antenna
array responses over a wide range across the CO vibration, the acquired
data points are consistently clustered and exhibit only a 4 cm–1 spread for the thin films. Based on these experimental
results, the nanoplasmonics approach is interestingly in-line with
IR transmission. The results establish the reliability of our surface-based
detection approach for analyzing thin samples relevant to biological
applications.

Conclusion
We experimentally demonstrated
the unique capabilities for ultrasensitive
real-time secondary structure detection on a protein monolayer and
thin films using mid-IR nanoplasmonic antennas. Our biosensing platform
enables reliable monitoring of protein conformational changes under
various conditions through the amide I signature as it is the most
prominent vibrational band of all proteins. To validate that our sensor
can reliably acquire the component frequencies of vibrational signatures
of thin films, we compared our approach with two conventional IR spectroscopy
techniques and demonstrated its correlation to IR transmission results.
Our surface-based nanosensor is promising for mid-IR secondary structural
analysis on minute protein samples including transient species in
dynamic conformational processes, such as amyloidogenic proteins during
fibrillization. The nanostructures are made out of gold which allows
exploitation of well-established and biocompatible surface functionalization
approaches for monitoring biomolecular interactions with a wide range
of stimuli including lipids, enzymes, peptides, or environmental conditions
such as pH, temperature, or ionic strength changes toward mimicking
interactions at the cell membrane. To minimize interference from surface
immobilization and retain the native functionality of the proteins,
advanced surface chemistry and molecular biology strategies can be
employed, for instance, by introducing specific functional groups
in regions outside the domains of interest or in flexible parts of
the proteins. Additionally, the response of the nanoantennas can be
engineered to enable access of other important vibrational bands in
proteins (e.g., amides II and III) for a more comprehensive IR analysis
of samples. Employing normal-incidence reflectance measurements with
this ultrasensitive detection principle can facilitate implementation
of imaging techniques and therefore multiplexing capabilities. In
contrast to conventional IR methods, this nanoplasmonic sensor can
offer numerous potentials for integration with chip-based mid-IR technologies
in a compact device footprint in conjunction with advanced microfluidics
for automated and dynamic study of protein conformations. Providing
such a platform to analyze, monitor, and potentially quantify protein
secondary changes under physiological conditions offers new opportunities
to investigate the conformational properties of biologically relevant
species and develop novel assays to identify inhibitors that target
the early steps of protein misfolding in the pathways to forming pathological
aggregates.
