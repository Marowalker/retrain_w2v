Molecularly imprinted
polymers (MIPs), synthetic polymeric receptors,
have been combined successfully with thermal transducers for the detection
of small molecules in recent years. However, up until now they have
been combined with planar electrodes which limits their use for in
vivo applications. In this work, a new biosensor platform is developed
by roll-coating MIP particles onto thermocouples, functionalized with
polylactic acid (PLLA). As a first proof-of-principle, MIPs for the
neurotransmitter dopamine were incorporated into PLLA-coated thermocouples.
The response of the synthetic receptor layer to an increasing concentration
of dopamine in buffer was analyzed using a homemade heat-transfer
setup. Binding of the template to the MIP layer blocks the heat transport
through the thermocouple, leading to less heat loss to the environment
and an overall higher temperature in the measuring chamber. The measured
temperature increase is correlated to the neurotransmitter concentration,
which enables measurement of dopamine levels in the micromolar regime.
To demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed biosensor
platform, thermocouples were functionalized with similar MIPs for
cortisol and serotonin, indicating a similar response and limit-of-detection.
As the platform does not require planar electrodes, it can easily
be integrated in, e.g., a catheter. In this way, it is an excellent
fit for the current niche in the market of therapeutics and diagnostics.
Moreover, the use of a biocompatible and disposable PLLA-layer further
illustrates its potential for in vivo diagnostics.

==== Body
Molecularly
imprinted polymers
(MIPs) are synthetic mimics of antibodies that have a predefined selectivity
and affinity for their target molecule, similar to that of “natural”
antibodies.1,2 Additionally, they overcome many issues
associated with the use of biological receptors because of their long-term
chemical and thermal stability,3,4 low-cost synthesis process,5 and ability to tailor the MIPs to the application.6 There is increasing interest to use these plastic
antibodies in several areas, such as affinity separation,7 clinical applications,8 and biosensing.9,10 Traditionally, the main research
focus lays in the area of affinity separation, with MIPs being commercially
available in the shape of cartridges to extract and purify samples.7,11 They have shown excellent selectivity, with the possibility to go
down to the level of chiral separations, and are compatible with extraction
in complicated matrices.12,13 Hoshino et al. have
demonstrated that polymer nanoparticles can be used in vivo to bind
and remove the bee venom melittin,14 with
the nanoparticles being cleared from the blood and excreted by the
liver. Recently, Haupt et al. presented work with polymeric receptors
as an active ingredient in a cosmetic product, where MIPs acts as
specific scavengers to trap nonodorous precursors of malodors.15

However, the use for MIPs in biosensing
platforms remains limited
due to the lack of straightforward, fast, and inexpensive readout
techniques,16,17 and difficulty of direct functionalization
of polymer particles onto electrode surfaces.4,18 To
address the first issue, we will make use of the heat-transfer method
(HTM), which ensures fast and low-cost detection compared to conventional
chromatography techniques.19,20 This versatile readout
technique was first reported by van Grinsven et al. in terms of DNA
mutation analysis.21 In recent years, the
platform has been combined with synthetic receptors for the detection
of a wide range of targets ranging from small organic molecules22 to macromolecular targets such as mammalian
cells and bacteria.23,24 Although the results of these
experiments were promising, the receptor layer was created by pressing
the MIP particles into an adhesive layer, covering planar electrodes.18 This method is time-consuming, the adhesive
layer is not biocompatible, and a planar electrode is hard to incorporate
into a platform for in vivo detection.25

Therefore, we propose a novel method for directly functionalizing
a thermocouple wire that registers the temperature in a liquid compartment
in time. The thermocouple was coated with a homogeneous biocompatible
and biodegradable polylactic (L)-acid (PLLA) adhesive layer by dip
coating.26,27 The PLLA layer was then heated above its
glass transition temperature giving it rubberlike properties, which
allows the MIP particles to sink into the layer after roll coating.

In a first series of experiments, MIPs for dopamine were used to
demonstrate the proof-of-principle. Dopamine (DA) was selected because
its MIP synthesis has been well-established28 and it plays a central role in the efficient functioning of a variety
of physiological processes.29 Additionally,
dopamine is associated with various mental disorders30,31 and age-related cognitive decline.32 MIP-functionalized
thermocouples were exposed to increasing concentrations of dopamine
and their response was analyzed using a homemade heat-transfer setup.21 In this way, the platform was able to quantify
dopamine concentrations in aqueous solutions in the range of 10–60
μM, which is within the physiologically relevant regime of dopamine
in urine.33,34

To illustrate that the concept can
be readily extended toward the
detection of other small organic molecules, thermocouples were functionalized
with MIPs for cortisol and serotonin. The corticosteroid, hormone
cortisol, plays an important role in the body’s response to
stress,35 while the serotoninergic system
steers numerous behavioral functions including emotion, sleep, and
appetite and is involved in numerous disorders including depression,
anorexia, and migraine.36 The results of
these experiments demonstrate that the sensor responds to these targets
when functionalized with the corresponding MIP in a manner similar
to that of dopamine.

The proposed functionalization procedure,
combined with the low-cost
nature of both the receptor layer and the readout methodology, illustrates
the potential of the biosensor platform in terms of the current niche
in the market of therapeutics and diagnostics for the rapid and inexpensive
quantification of compounds in vivo. As the method allows one to directly
immobilize the receptor particles onto the thermocouple wire it can
be readily extended toward, e.g., coating a catheter for in vivo detection
of small organic molecules in bodily fluids. Additionally, both the
adhesive layer and the MIP particles are biocompatible and disposable,
which are important characteristics in terms of in vivo diagnostic
applications.

Experimental Methods
Reagents
The chemicals for the MIP synthesis, ethylene
glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), methacrylic acid (MAA), dopamine hydrochloride
salt (purity 99%), and the initiator 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric
acid), were purchased from Acros (Loughborough, United Kingdom). Hydrocortisone
(purity 98%) and azobis(isobutyronitrile) were purchased from Acros
(The Netherlands). Stabilizers in the monomers MAA and EGDMA were
removed by running the solutions over an alumina packed column. PLLA
1010, used as the adhesive layer, was ordered from Corbion Purac (Amsterdam,
The Netherlands). Thermocouples type K (0.5 mm × 30 mm) were
obtained from TC Direct (Maarssen, The Netherlands).

Functionalization
Approach
Details of the dopamine
and serotonin MIP synthesis protocols are described in refs (22 and 37). After removal of the template
from the MIPs, the bulk of the polymer was ground and sieved to obtain
microparticles with sizes smaller than 10 μm. A nonimprinted
reference (NIP) was synthesized in the same manner, but without the
presence of dopamine. Cortisol MIPs were produced by dissolving hydrocortisone
(0.5 mmol), MAA (5 mmol), EGDMA (44.8 mmol), and azobisosobutyronitrile
(0.2 mmol) in 7 mL chloroform. The mixture was degassed with nitrogen
for 5 min and then placed in a rotating UV oven at 4 °C for 42
h. The resulting polymer block was ground and sieved to obtain particles
<50 μm. To remove the template, a Soxhlet extraction was
employed using the following solvents: methanol (24 h), followed by
a 1:1 ratio of acetonitrile to acetic acid (48 h), and methanol again
(24 h). This protocol was adapted from a protocol developed by Baggiani
et al.11 The same protocol was followed
to synthesize the NIP, but without the addition of the hydrocortisone.
These MIP and NIP powders were subsequently functionalized onto thermocouples
coated with PLLA.

To obtain a PLLA sheet around the thermocouple,
PLLA (200 mg/mL) was first dissolved into chloroform by heating it
under reflux for 2 h. Subsequently, the thermocouples were dipped
into the PLLA solution for 10 s and withdrawn at a rate of 0.39 cm/min.
The PLLA-coated thermocouples were heated above the glass transition
temperature of the polymer (75 °C), allowed to incorporate the
MIP particles by manual roll coating at 75 °C. After rapid cooling
of the layer for 5 min, the PLLA returned to its original crystalline
state, trapping the MIP particles inside the layer. Functionalized
thermocouples were rinsed with isopropanol to remove any unbound particles
from the adhesive layer.

Characterization of MIP Coating Properties
Optical
images were acquired with an Olympus BX 35 Microscope (Zoeterwoude,
The Netherlands) to determine the thickness of the polymer coating
and the surface coverage of the MIPs. Surface coverage was determined
by performing SPIP (software available at http://www.imagemet.com). The
MIP powders are white and have a different appearance than the transparent
PLLA undercoat. The contrast of the optical images is adjusted to
create pixels of a size of 1 μm in order to digitally distinguish
between the MIP and the underlying coating. The difference between
pixelated (MIP) and nonpixelated (noncoated area) is used to determine
the proportion of the surface covered with microparticles. To compare
the wires, for each MIP or NIP the same region on the 2D optical image
was sampled. An example of this process is provided in the Supporting Information.

Heat-Transfer Measurements
The homemade heat-transfer
setup is described in detail in previous work.21 The heat-transfer setup was connected to a Perspex flow
cell with an inner volume of 110 μL and sealed off with an O-ring.
The copper block of the setup serves as a heat sink or a heat provider
and its temperature, T1, is actively steered by a proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controller coupled to a power resistor. In all measurements,
this temperature was kept constant at 37.00 °C to mimic body
temperature. The thermocouple functionalized with MIP particles measures
the temperature inside the flow cell, which is defined as T2 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the heat flow through the MIP- and
NIP-coated thermocouples, represented by the position and size of
the arrows. It is observed that binding of dopamine (red dots) decreases
the transfer of heat from the liquid inside the flow cell to the thermocouple.
This will result in an increase in T2 as less heat will
be lost to the environment via the thermocouple.

Prior to measuring, the flow cell was filled with phosphate
buffered
saline (PBS) solutions and the signal is left to stabilize for 45
min after the start of the measurement. The concentration of target
is increased subsequently by introducing target solutions in PBS with
different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10,15, 20, 25, 50 μM)
at a constant rate of 0.25 mL min–1, using an automated
syringe pump. The signal is allowed to stabilize for 30 min between
each addition. Throughout the measurement, T1 and T2 were recorded and plotted vs the concentration to obtain
a dose–response curve. The temperature of T1 is
actively steered and no changes are expected here, while T2 is monitored and will be affected by the concentration of dopamine
bound to the MIP layer.

Results
Surface Analysis of the
Coating
An optical analysis
of the coating procedure is summarized in Figure 2. Images were obtained for an uncoated (left),
PLLA-coated (middle), and MIP/NIP-functionalized thermocouple. These
images were used to determine the surface coverage by SPIP analysis
(Supporting Information). Surface coverages
of 48 ± 1% and 49 ± 1% were obtained for MIP and NIP, respectively.

powder.

Quantitative Dopamine Detection
All measurements were
performed according to the scheme described in the Experimental Methods of the manuscript. The results for a
dopamine MIP-coated thermocouple and its reference are show in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Blue and orange lines
represent the voltage over the power resistor
for the dopamine MIP- and NIP-coated thermocouples, respectively.
In addition, the red and black lines show the temperature T2 as measured by the thermocouple functionalized with MIP (black)
and with NIP (red). The results were measured in time after exposure
of the thermocouples to dopamine solutions in PBS with increasing
concentrations of dopamine (0–50 μM) and clearly indicate
that T2 increases and V decreases for the MIP at high dopamine
concentrations, while both signals remain unaffected when measuring
with a nonimprinted reference.

It can be seen that the temperature inside the flow cell,
T2, registered by the thermocouple, drops immediately after
each addition step (black and red curves). This can be explained by
the fact that cool liquid is injected into the flow cell. The signal
restores itself due to the PID-controlled steering of T1. Therefore, the voltage over the power resistor (blue and orange
curves), needed to keep the temperature of the copper block constant,
increases after each step. Both the temperature and the voltage were
allowed to stabilize after each addition step by stopping flow for
30 min. The resulting voltage signal over the power resistor stays
more or less constant upon stabilization over the entire concentration
range for the measurements with a NIP-coated thermocouple. However,
the measurement with the MIP-coated thermocouple indicates that the
voltage over the power resistor starts decreasing from 5 to 2.5 V
at increasing concentrations above 10 μM.

More distinct
differences between the MIP and NIP were observed
in the temperature T2; both thermocouples stabilized at
a temperature of ±32.5 °C, after addition of 10 μM
dopamine in PBS the temperature increased to ±32.9 °C for
the MIP, while no significant effect was found in the experiment with
the NIP-coated electrode. This effect becomes more pronounced as the
concentration inside the flow cell increases and levels off at concentration
above 25 μM.

To demonstrate that the observed effects
are reproducible, measurements
were performed with an additional three samples that were functionalized
with MIP particles. The results of these independent measurements
are provided in Figure 4 and show a similar pattern for all MIPs under study.

Figure 4 Reproducibility experiment:
the blue, orange, and green lines demonstrate
the voltage over the power resistor for three different thermocouples
that were functionalized with dopamine MIP particles. The functionalized
thermocouples were exposed to solutions of PBS with increasing concentrations
of dopamine (0–50 μM). The red, black, and purple lines
show the temperature T2 as measured by the MIP-functionalized
thermocouples, which was nearly identical for the three samples.

Dose–Response Curve
The results summarized in
the previous chapter were used to determine the effect size and construct
a dose–response curve. The effect size was calculated according
to eq 1. In this equation,
T2 (c = x) represents
the temperature when a certain concentration of dopamine (c = x) was added. This value was taken
when the temperature stabilized and reached a new plateau level. T2 (c = 0) corresponds to the baseline and
is the temperature that is measured when no target is present. 1  The
effect sizes were determined
for the MIP and NIP and plotted as a function of the target concentration
(Figure 5) to obtain
dose–response curves. The data could be fitted with a standard
sigmoidal dose–response fit (R2 = 0.99 for MIP and NIP). The dose–response curve reveals
a concentration-dependent increase between 10 and 100 μM after
which the signal saturates.

Figure 5 Cumulative dopamine concentration (μM)
is plotted vs the
effect size to construct the corresponding dose–response curve.
The effect size is determined as the temperature at a certain dopamine
concentration in PBS divided by the temperature in PBS multiplied
by 100. Error bars were calculated by taking the standard deviation
of three independent MIP and NIP measurements.

General Applicability of the Setup
The results presented
in the previous sections illustrate the potential of the platform
for detecting dopamine in aqueous media. To determine whether or not
the concept could be extended toward other small organic residues,
MIPs were synthesized for the corticoid steroid cortisol and the neurotransmitter
serotonin as described in the Experimental Methods. These particles were incorporated into PLLA-coated thermocouples
using an analogous procedure as described for the dopamine MIPs. MIP-
and NIP-coated thermocouples were analyzed using HTM in a manner similar
to the experiments described above for the dopamine MIP. The resulting
time-dependent temperature and voltage profiles and dose–response
curves for both experiments are summarized in Figure 6. These experiments demonstrate that similar
values for the detection limit and dynamic range were found for cortisol
and serotonin.

Figure 6 Rebinding experiment using cortisol and serotonin MIPs.
Time-dependent
temperature and voltage profiles are shown in response to an increasing
concentration of cortisol and serotonin in (a) and (c), respectively.
Corresponding dose–response curves are also shown in (b) and
(d); the error bars on the data represent the standard error on the
average over three measurements on three individual thermocouples,
functionalized with the same MIP. The results demonstrate a similar
behavior to that observed in experiments using dopamine MIPs.

Discussion
Optical
analysis of the functionalized thermocouples reveals that
the MIP particles attach firmly to the adhesive PLLA layer. In this
way, the functionalization process has proven to be an elegant method
to immobilize MIP particles directly onto a sensing element. The surface
coverage was determined by SPIP analysis and reveals that the method
is very reproducible with average surface coverages of 48 ± 1%
and 49 ± 1% for NIP and MIP, respectively. Each sample had a
similar surface coverage and particle distribution, which is a precondition
to perform differential measurements and compare the results obtained
by the thermal measurements. In addition, the achieved surface coverage
appears to be a lot better in comparison to the surface coverage of
30 ± 1% that was achieved previously by stamping polymer particles
into a poly[2]methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene
(MDMO-PPV) layer on planar electrodes.22 The PLLA adhesive layer has the additional benefit of being low-cost,
biocompatible, and biodegradable. However, since the total surface
area of the thermocouple is about a factor of 8 lower (0.126 cm2 versus 1 cm2 for the planar electrode), the total
amount of MIP particles present on the thermocouple will be a factor
of 5 lower in comparison to the planar electrodes used previously.

The concentration-dependent increase in T2 observed
during the heat-transfer analysis can be explained by the scheme in Figure 1. In the absence
of the target, a constant amount of heat is transported from the liquid
to the thermocouple through the MIP particles and the PLLA layer.
However, according to the “pore-blocking” model, binding
of small molecules into the nanocavities of the MIP will block the
heat flow through the MIP layer.22 In this
case, less heat will be transported into the thermocouple which, in
turn, transports the heat away from the flow cell. The decrease in
heat loss to the environment would explain why T2 would
stabilize at a higher value at equilibrium. Although it has to be
noted that this particular model described the effect of MIPs onto
electrodes and has not been applied to MIP-functionalized thermocouples
before, the voltage drop over the power resistor at high dopamine
concentration provides further evidence for this theory, as it would
require less energy to keep the heat-sink at a fixed temperature when
there is less heat loss to the environment.

The observed effect
appears to be concentration-dependent with
a limit-of-detection of ±8 μM and a linear range from 8
to 60 μM. Although the limit-of-detection (LoD) is roughly an
order of magnitude lower in comparison to the LoD of a similar platform
using screen-printed MIP electrodes,36 the
linear range of the sensor corresponds fairly well with the physiologically
relevant concentration range of dopamine in serum and urine, that
lies between 1 and 25 μM.31 The limited
sensitivity and narrow dynamic range of the sensor can be partially
explained by the smaller surface area of the thermocouple in comparison
to the planar electrodes. In addition, the stamping and screen-printing
strategies used in previous research22,37 were the result
of years of optimization. The current technique can be improved by
increasing the available surface area (thicker thermocouples, increased
coating length, etc.) and optimizing the immobilization strategy (optimizing
layer thickness, surface coverage, particle distribution, etc.) to
boost the sensitivity of the device toward the nanomolar regime.

The reproducibility and general applicability of the sensor were
also demonstrated in this work. NIP-coated thermocouples did not seem
to react significantly to each of the target molecules even in very
high concentrations while MIPs for different targets displayed the
same concentration-dependent behavior with similar LoDs and DRs. Moreover,
the maximum increase in temperature of ±1 °C corresponds
well to concentration-dependent effects on thermal transport, associated
with the binding of both large macromolecular entities, such as cells,
to surface-imprinted polyurethane layers23,24 and small organic molecules to MIP particles immobilized onto planar
electrodes.22,37

Conclusion
The
work in this article describes an elegant procedure for immobilizing
a synthetic receptor layer, in this case composed of MIPs imprinted
with dopamine, cortisol, and serotonin, directly on a thermocouple
wire. Optical image analysis revealed that the MIPs firmly attach
to the PLLA-coated thermocouple in a very reproducible manner. The
LoD of the sensor of 10 μM and dynamic range of 10–80
μM would allow the end-user to faithfully measure the concentration
of dopamine in physiological values in urine and serum. Future research
should be aimed at improving the immobilization process in order to
further improve the sensitivity and dynamic range of the current platform.

The major advantage of the sensor lies in its unique, user-friendly
design. MIP particles are incorporated directly onto the sensing element,
thereby overcoming the need for planar electrodes or chips. In addition,
the platform is biocompatible and the PLLA layer is degradable making
the sensing element disposable. In this way, the interesting combination
of robust synthetic receptors and a low-cost thermal readout platform
is translated into a device that suits the current market needs. The
observations summarized in this paper could be extrapolated to, e.g.,
catheters or dipstick devices that would allow for in vivo or point-of-care
detection of small organic residues.
