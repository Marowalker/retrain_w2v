Naturally
occurring paramagnetic species (PS), such as free radicals
and paramagnetic metalloproteins, play an essential role in a multitude
of critical physiological processes including metabolism, cell signaling,
and immune response. These highly dynamic species can also act as
intrinsic biomarkers for a variety of disease states, while synthetic
paramagnetic probes targeted to specific sites on biomolecules enable
the study of functional information such as tissue oxygenation and
redox status in living systems. The work presented herein describes
a new sensing method that exploits the spin-dependent emission of
photoluminescence (PL) from an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers
in diamond for rapid, nondestructive detection of PS in living systems.
Uniquely this approach involves simple measurement protocols that
assess PL contrast with and without the application of microwaves.
The method is demonstrated to detect concentrations of paramagnetic
salts in solution and the widely used magnetic resonance imaging contrast
agent gadobutrol with a limit of detection of less than 10 attomol
over a 100 μm × 100 μm field of view. Real-time monitoring
of changes in the concentration of paramagnetic salts is demonstrated
with image exposure times of 20 ms. Further, dynamic tracking of chemical
reactions is demonstrated via the conversion of low-spin cyanide-coordinated
Fe3+ to hexaaqua Fe3+ under acidic conditions.
Finally, the capability to map paramagnetic species in model cells
with subcellular resolution is demonstrated using lipid membranes
containing gadolinium-labeled phospholipids under ambient conditions
in the order of minutes. Overall, this work introduces a new sensing
approach for the realization of fast, sensitive imaging of PS in a
widefield format that is readily deployable in biomedical settings.
Ultimately, this new approach to nitrogen vacancy-based quantum sensing
paves the way toward minimally invasive real-time mapping and observation
of free radicals in in vitro cellular environments.

Paramagnetic
species (PS), which
contain at least one unpaired electron in their valence shell, play
critical roles both in normal physiology and in the pathophysiology
of many diseases.1−4 Free radicals, including superoxide, hydroxyl, reactive oxygen species,
and reactive nitrogen species, are important endogenous PS involved
in numerous physiological processes including the immune response
to infection,5 cell signaling,3 and redox regulation.6 Moreover, elevated levels of free radicals can alter structural
and functional properties of vital molecules, including lipids, proteins,
and nucleic acids, leading to extensive tissue dysfunction and injury.7 Further, several endogenous PS have potential
as biomarkers for a variety of disease states.1−4 Mn2+, for instance,
has been related to developmental abnormalities in the bone and skin8,9 and a number of neurodegenerative diseases.10 Similarly, variations in the bioavailability of the reactive nitrogen
species nitric oxide are reportedly related to disease states such
as pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, or heart failure.11 At the same time, there is an expanding range
of exogenous PS being used to probe function and molecular structure
in living systems, via site-specific targeting of biomolecules,12−15 and to extend the detection lifetime of short-lived endogenous PS
via spin trapping.16−18 Due to the multitude of roles PS play in biology,
there is a significant need for suitable sensing technologies capable
of rapid detection of biologically relevant concentrations of PS under
measurement conditions compatible with sustaining living systems.

Numerous approaches exist for detecting PS, however many of these
are not satisfactory or suitable for use in living systems. Existing
approaches include time-consuming colorimetric assays addressing nonspecific
byproducts19−21 or biologically incompatible methods, such as magnetic
resonance force microscopy22 or superconducting
quantum interference devices,23 which require
sample preparation and data acquisition at cryogenic temperatures.
Furthermore, fluorescent probes, which are widely established as probes
for monitoring redox states in live cells, have numerous shortfalls,
such as cytotoxicity, photobleaching, and nonspecific interactions
often leading to inaccurate results.21,24 Of the available
approaches, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is
arguably one of the most powerful and established methods for detection
of PS in biological samples. EPR spectroscopy allows for the direct
detection of long-lived PS, as well as short-lived PS when functionalized
with spin traps or spin probes. The technique also offers high chemical
specificity and the ability to monitor changes in oxidation state.7 EPR spectroscopy, however, has inherently low
sensitivity demanding high concentrations or large sample volumes,
neither of which are practical for biological samples. Further, important
endogenous PS are typically produced in intracellular compartments
such as the mitochondria and as such mapping these species requires
microscale imaging capabilities, which is orders of magnitude beyond
current EPR imaging capabilities.25,26 Thus, alternative
strategies are required to attain the combination of spatio-temporal
resolution, spin sensitivity, and the operability under ambient conditions
to detect PS in cellular environments.

The nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) color center in diamond has emerged as
a high-performance quantum sensor capable of detecting PS. The NV
color center is a naturally occurring paramagnetic impurity comprising
of a substitutional nitrogen atom adjacent to a vacant lattice site,
which in the negative charge state (NV–) forms a
spin triplet ground state energy level having |ms = 0⟩ and degenerate |ms = ±1⟩ spin states. Optical pumping of the |ms = 0⟩ ground state with green light results in
a broadband PL emission with a zero phonon line at 637 nm and longer
wavelength emission extending into the infrared region. NV– centers display remarkable chemical stability and photostability
and have been used for a wide range of applications in biological
sciences as fluorescent imaging probes.27−30 Key to the NV– sensing capabilities is the addition of microwave excitation, which
can be employed to manipulate the ground- and excited-state spin levels,
such that the PL intensity of the optically pumped system reduces
when electrons occupy the |ms = ±1⟩
spin states. The degeneracy of the |ms = ±1⟩ spin states can be lifted by the application of
external magnetic fields. The lifting of the degeneracy enables a
variety of highly sensitive sensing protocols, which in recent years
have led to the application of the NV– center as
a sensor for measuring changes in external perturbations, including
magnetic and electric fields,31−36 temperature,27,37,38 pressure, and lattice strain.39,40

Among the catalog
of NV-based sensing protocols is longitudinal
spin (T1)-based relaxometry, whereby rapidly fluctuating magnetic
fields are quantified based on the rate of mixing of spin states in
the ground state triplet after optical polarization into the ground
state |ms = 0⟩. This technique
has been successfully implemented for detection of various PS, such
as Gd3+,41,42 Mn2+, and ferritin.43,44 While these methods prove to be highly sensitive and can provide
spatial as well as quantitative information, they require the application
of carefully constructed laser and microwave pulse sequences and measurement
times in the order of seconds to hours to achieve an accurate readout
of concentration, together with an optimal signal to noise ratio (SNR)
necessary for high-resolution quantitative imaging.

The work
reported herein presents a highly sensitive, minimally
invasive dynamic sensing technique based on the contrast of PL emission
from an ensemble of shallow NV– centers in diamond
with and without microwaves. The technique is demonstrated and the
limit of detection is determined using aqueous solutions of gadolinium
nitrate (Gd(NO3)3), ferric chloride (FeCl3), and a widely used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast
agent gadobutrol. The ability to dynamically track changes in the
spin state is also demonstrated via conversion of low-spin cyanide-coordinated
Fe3+ to hexaaqua Fe3+ under acidic conditions.
The capability to image PS on a subcellular level is also demonstrated
using multilamellar liposomes containing Gd3+-labeled phospholipids.
Importantly, the method described is implemented on a commercially
available fluorescence microscope using the microscope control software
and as such could be readily used by nonspecialists in the biological
community. Overall, the combination of spatio-temporal resolution,
spin sensitivity, and the operability under ambient conditions using
widefield quantum sensing paves the way toward minimally invasive
real-time observation of free radicals within in vitro cellular environments.

Materials and Methods
Diamond Samples
The diamond samples used in this study
were 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm × 0.5 mm polished, electronic grade
single-crystal diamond plates grown by chemical vapor deposition,
with bulk nitrogen content [N] < 5 ppb and (100)-oriented
top surface polished with <0.5 nm Ra (purchased from Element Six,
Ascot, UK). The diamond plates were implanted with 14N+ and 15N+ ions at an energy of 6 keV
with a dose of 1013 ions/cm2. Concentration
profiles of the implanted 14N+ ions were determined
with the Monte Carlo simulation code Stopping and Range of Ions in
Matter (SRIM) [http://www.srim.org] with a projected depth of 14.7 nm and a straggle of 5.6 nm. Following
implantation, the samples were annealed under nitrogen gas according
to methods reported by Chu et al.45 Prior
to measurements, the plates were cleaned by keeping them under acid
reflux for 2 h using a 1:1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric
acid. This was followed by surface oxidation under air for 10 h at
465 °C and another step of refluxing in the acid mixture for
2 h. The diamond plates were then rinsed with deionized water and
kept in dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide.

NV-Based Sensing
The NV-based sensing regime involved
detection of PL from an ensemble of shallow NV centers in the diamond
plates with and without the application of MWs. The experimental setup
(Figure 1) involved
mounting a diamond plate on a glass coverslip attached to a custom-designed
printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB was designed to have an aperture
enabling illumination of the sample via an inverted fluorescence microscope
(Olympus IX83) and electrical connection for delivery of MWs. A 0.125
mm diameter straight copper wire running across the top of the diamond
plate and electrically connected to 50 Ohm tracks on the PCB was used
to deliver MWs from a Keysight N2581B vector signal generator and
an AR 20S1G4 MW amplifier. The signal generator power and the MW amplifier
gain were 0 dBm and 30%, respectively. NV centers were illuminated
with a mercury arc lamp filtered through a narrow bandpass excitation
filter centered at 532 nm. The light was subsequently focused on the
back focal plane of an oil-immersion 60× TIRF objective lens
(NA = 1.49), providing a power density of 1 W/cm2 at the
sample position. Emitted PL was filtered through a 575 nm long-pass
filter and imaged onto a sCMOS camera (Photometrics 95 Prime B) providing
a maximum field of view of 200 μm × 200 μm. It is
recognized that the use of the 575 nm long-pass filter will result
in collection of PL from any NV0 defects present; however,
this PL is invariant with the application of MWs and hence the influence
of NV0 emission on ODMR contrast is obviated. Moreover,
measurements obtained using a 650 nm long-pass filter provided the
same trends in ODMR contrast reported here; however, it led to significant
reductions in signal to noise ratios owing to reduced photon collection
from NV– defects at shorter wavelengths.

and connectors for MW delivery. Optical illumination and detection
paths also shown. Right: Schematic diagram of the NV– center showing the transition between ground and excited triplet
states and microwave excitation of |ms = 0⟩ to |ms = ±1⟩
leading to the singlet state pathway.

The detection method presented here is based on PS-induced changes
in PL contrast. Experimentally, the presence of PS was first performed
via acquisition of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra
using a continuous wave (CW) measurement regime in which illumination
was constant and images of PL were acquired as the MW frequency was
swept to probe separately the ground state (2.77–2.97 GHz)
and excited-state (1.35–1.55 GHz) NV spin transitions. Image
acquisition was synchronized with MW sweeps using an Olympus Real-Time
Controller (RTC) via the Olympus CellSens software (Tokyo, Japan).
The resulting images at each frequency were analyzed to extract the
PL intensity, determined by summing pixel intensities from 100 μm
× 100 μm sized fields of view, over which the lamp intensity
was uniform. At each frequency, 10 repeats of measurements were performed
for three different fields of view. ODMR spectra were produced by
plotting average PL intensity from all repeats and fields of view
against MW frequency. ODMR spectra were then normalized by dividing
all average PL intensities by the maximum averaged intensity within
the sweep.

Next, a fast and simple measurement protocol was
demonstrated that
involved acquisition of images of PL with MWs on resonance (2.868
GHz) and MWs off. Exposure times of 20 ms were used for each image,
and PL intensity was determined by summing pixel values across 100
μm × 100 μm sized fields of view in each image. The
ratio of PL intensity for MWs on and MWs off was calculated and normalized
by dividing this ratio by the PL intensity obtained for deionized
water with MWs on and MWs off. Calibration curves (Figure 3) plotting the normalized ratio
of PL with MWs on to MWs off were produced using datasets consisting
of 100 pairs of images. In this instance, the PL intensity values
were summed for each image and the average PL intensity was determined.

Exemplar samples were used to study the effect of PS on ODMR spectra
and contrast with MWs on and MWs off. Here, aqueous solutions of Gd(NO3)3, FeCl3, LaCl3, and gadobutrol
were chosen due to their varied paramagnetic properties and relevance
to biological systems and bioimaging. Indeed, Gd3+ is of
particular interest as it is strongly paramagnetic due to its seven
unpaired electrons in the 4f subshell. Here, it is studied as a salt
and as a chelate in the form of the widely used NMR contrast agent
gadobutrol. Fe3+ was also chosen due to its five unpaired
electrons and its relevance to a multitude of biological processes
reliant on electron transfer.46 Lanthanum(III)
chloride (LaCl3) was used as a control as it is chemically
similar to Gd3+, however it does not have any unpaired
electrons and thus enables the assessment of the role paramagnetism
plays in the NV sensing protocols described. Further to ensure that
potential changes in the solution dielectric constant were neither
responsible for the contrast observed nor did they significantly modify
MW power transfer, the dielectric properties of Gd(NO3)3, FeCl3, and LaCl3 were measured with
a network analyzer (Keysight N5232 PNA-L). Negligible differences
between the dielectric constants were found, and correspondingly only
minor changes in the relative MW power transmission at 2.87 GHz as
a function of analyte concentration resulted (Supplementary Figure 4).

Each exemplar sample was separately
pipetted (100 μL) with
increasing concentration on to the diamond plates. Plates were washed
with deionized water in between each concentration increase and acid-cleaned
between each solution type. The starting PL and ODMR contrast were
recorded after each acid-cleaning step to confirm the return to levels
previously recorded in deionized water. As such, there was no evidence
that the acid-cleaning protocol used affected experimental results.
The ability to dynamically track changes in the concentration of PS
in solution was demonstrated using the MWon:MWoff protocol using temporally
varying concentrations of aqueous solutions of Gd(NO3)3 and tracking the conversion of low-spin cyanide-coordinated
Fe3+ to hexaaqua Fe3+ under acidic conditions.
Here, image exposure times as short as 20 ms were used.

Liposome Preparation
and Imaging
Liposomes were used
as cell models to demonstrate the potential of the MWon:MWoff protocol
to map PS on a subcellular level. Liposomes were prepared at room
temperature using HPLC grade chloroform, methanol, and buffer solution
at pH 7.4 (20 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 30 mM sodium sulfate).
Chloroform-solubilized phosphatidylcholine (POPC, Avanti Polar Lipids)
was mixed with biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine (Biotinyl Cap
PE) at a molar ratio of 10:1. Powdered Gd3+-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE-DTPA-Gd3+, Avanti Polar Lipids) was resuspended in
a chloroform:methanol mixture (3:1 v/v) and added to the POPC:Biotinyl
Cap PE mixture in chloroform to achieve a molar ratio of POPC:PE-DTPA-Gd3+ of 6:1. The resulting mixture was dried under nitrogen at
room temperature and resuspended in buffer solution. Control liposomes
were prepared by mixing POPC and Biotinyl Cap PE at a molar ratio
of 13:1.

Attachment of liposomes on the diamond plate involved
first immersing the plate in an aqueous solution of 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES). N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
were added at a concentration of 52 and 87 mM, respectively. After
15 min, the plate was washed with buffer solution and immersed in
a 4 μM streptavidin solution. After 10 min, the plate was washed
with buffer solution and immersed in the 10-fold diluted liposome
suspension for 1 h. The plate was then washed and stored in buffer
solution. Widefield images of the Gd3+ containing liposomes
and control liposomes attached to the diamond plates were subsequently
acquired using the MWon:MWoff protocol. 5000 pairs of images with
MWs on resonance and MWs off were obtained. Each stack of 5000 images
obtained with MWs on and MWs off was summed, and the ratio of the
final summed images was determined. Differential interference contrast
(DIC) images were also recorded as a sum of a stack of 100 images
to demonstrate liposome morphology and cross-reference with the MWon:MWoff
images.

Results and Discussion
ODMR frequency
sweeps were performed for exemplar solutions over
a range of concentrations from 10 nM to 2 M. Concentrations above
1 M Fe3+ were not tested as they are above the solubility
limit. For clarity, Figure 2 displays ODMR spectra for selected concentrations between
100 nM and 1 M (see Supplementary Information Figure 1 for all concentrations). The results are indicative
of ODMR spectra obtained from NV– color centers
in that there is a reduction in PL around the ground state resonance
frequency (2.87 GHz) for the transition between the |ms = 0⟩ and |ms = ±
1⟩ spin state in the absence of an externally applied magnetic
field. Near the resonance frequency, a split is seen in all spectra
reflective of intrinsic strain in the diamond chip.47 Inspection of all plots shown in Figure 2 reveals the dependence of PL on the concentration
and chemical form of PS. Indeed, as concentration of PS increases,
so too does the ratio between PL intensity on resonance to the highest
PL intensity off resonance. This is particularly apparent for solutions
containing Gd3+ (both Gd(NO3)3 and
gadobutrol). The change in normalized PL intensity with concentration
is less for FeCl3 solutions and negligible for LaCl3 solutions across the concentration range studied. Differences
are also observed between the chelated form of Gd3+ and
free Gd3+, which are known to differ in paramagnetic strength.
Collectively, these results point to a strong dependence of PL contrast
on paramagnetic strength.

solutions of varying concentrations of paramagnetic species: (A) gadolinium
nitrate (Gd(NO3)3), (B) ferric chloride (FeCl3), (C) lanthanum(III) chloride (LaCl3), and (D)
gadobutrol.

For all exemplar solutions, insignificant
changes in the linewidth
(Supplementary Figure 2) and the location
of the resonance dip were observed, suggesting that these parameters
have a negligible effect on the contrast observed. Further, the change
in normalized PL intensity was minimal with solution pH, the variation
being within 1% across a pH range of 0.6–13, which is equivalent
to the change induced by 1.1 μM Gd3+ (Supplementary Table 1). Further measurements
were made to investigate the ratio between PL intensity on resonance
to the highest PL intensity off resonance around the excited-state
resonance (Supplementary Figure 3), which
was also found to depend on PS concentration and paramagnetic strength
as observed for the ground state transition. Collectively, these results
point to a dependence of the observed contrast on the concentration
and paramagnetic strength of the solvated metal ions.

Figure 3 displays the calibration curves obtained by measuring
PL intensity with MW turned off and MW on resonance (2.868 GHz) with
contrast being calculated as the ratio of PL intensity with MW on
resonance to that with MW turned off. Normalized contrast (the ratio
of test solution normalized contrast to normalized contrast obtained
for deionized water) is shown in the graphs and depends strongly on
concentration for the two paramagnetic metal ions, namely, Gd3+ and Fe3+, while negligible change is measured
for La3+. Gd3+, which has a higher paramagnetic
strength than Fe3+, displays a stronger concentration dependence
and is detected at lower concentration as compared to Fe3+. The results depicted on a logarithmic concentration scale reveal
an apparent plateau in Gd(NO3)3 results between
100 μM and 10 mM. It is hypothesized that this is related to
the nonuniform distribution of ions in the detection volume, which
extends approximately 10 nm above the surface of the diamond chip.
A similar effect was previously observed with aqueous Mn2+ and was attributed to the inhomogeneous adsorption of ions on the
diamond surface.44 The nonuniform packing
of the ions at the interface would affect the exchange rate of water
molecules in the outer coordination sphere, which significantly affects
the spin properties of Gd3+ ions.48−51 The effect is not observed with
chelated Gd3+ as evidenced by the titration data recorded
for titrations of gadobutrol (Figure 3c,d), which exhibits a linear concentration dependency
of the normalized contrast throughout the entire concentration range
studied. Differences in the absolute values of contrast between the
chelated Gd3+ and free Gd3+ are also seen for
concentrations above 0.1 M with gadobutrol producing contrast greater
than 1.04 compared to lower contrast observed for free Gd3+ (1.02–1.04). These results demonstrate the high sensitivity
of the presented sensing regime not only to PS concentration but also
to the coordination environment.

Figure 3 Calibration curves: Dependence of the
ratio of PL intensity with
MW on resonance (2.868 GHz) to PL intensity with MWs off on concentration
of aqueous solutions of paramagnetic metals. Data is normalized to
results obtained for deionized water. For clarity, results are shown
on a linear scale (A) and (C) and a semilogarithmic scale (B) and
(D).

The capability of the sensing
protocol to respond dynamically to
changes in the concentration of PS was investigated by sequentially
adding aqueous solutions with increasing concentration of Gd(NO3)3 to the surface of the diamond plate and monitoring
contrast in PL intensity over time. Figure 4 displays the contrast obtained from the
ratio of PL intensity with MW on (2.868 GHz) to that with MW off over
time. Abrupt changes in contrast are observed corresponding to the
addition of aliquots of solutions of higher concentration. These results
serve as a demonstration that the simple measurement protocol presented
allows fast detection of variations in the concentration of PS, which
is of particular relevance for monitoring in biological systems. The
time resolution of the measurement protocol is dependent on the acquisition
time of a pair of images (MW on, MW off) and the SNR. The current
protocol uses 20 ms exposure time for each image and 23.5 ms switching
time (required by the control unit triggering the MW signal generator),
therefore each data point in Figure 4 is acquired in 87 ms. Using the Nyquist criteria,
this equates to a maximum sampling rate of 5.7 Hz. There is scope
for tremendous improvement in the signal to noise ratio and switching
time. Lower exposure times could be readily deployed through detection
of more photons (e.g., improved collection efficiency of emitted photons,
improved quantum efficiency of the camera, and increased light intensity).
Such improvements will enable faster camera rates, and in principle
with the camera used in this work, 1 kHz acquisition speed is possible
corresponding to a maximum sampling rate of 250 Hz (4 ms) based on
the Nyquist criteria and requirement of two images per data point.

intensity with MW on (2.868 GHz) to that with MW off (left y-axis) for aqueous solutions with increasing concentration

The sensing protocol was also used to study the
kinetics of ferricyanide
decomposition under acidic conditions. Potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) was added to concentrated hydrochloric
acid and kept at 95 °C. The reaction leads to the formation of
a complex mixture containing cyanide-coordinated Fe3+/2+ compounds (including unreacted potassium ferricyanide) and soluble
hexaaquairon(III) ([Fe(H2O)6]3+)
irreversibly obtained in the form of FeCl3 along with hydrogen
cyanide (HCN).52 The conversion of low-spin
ferricyanide to high-spin hexaaquairon(III) is accompanied by an increase
in the paramagnetic strength of the reaction mixture. Results presented
in Figure 5 depict
higher values in the normalized PL contrast 2 min after initiation
of the reaction. This result is consummate with an increase in PS
concentration equivalent to a conversion efficiency of 60% ferricyanide
to FeCl3 (Figure 5A). The following apparent plateau is continued with a slow
increase of the contrast possibly due to side reactions with slow
kinetics. An apparent slow accumulation of PS is observed in the control
solution containing only potassium ferricyanide, which undergoes reactions
with mirroring kinetics (Figure 5B).

Figure 5 Dynamic study of ferricyanide decomposition under acidic
conditions
leading to the conversion of low-spin ferricyanide to high-spin hexaaquairon(III).
As the reaction progresses, there is an increase in the paramagnetic
strength of the reaction mixture. Normalized PL contrast with MWs
on resonance and MWs off is shown on the full time scale studied (A)
and shorter time scale to highlight the early changes in contrast
(B).

The MWon:MWoff measurement protocol was also
used to map the presence of PS in synthetic liposomes attached to
a diamond surface (Figure 6). The MWon:MWoff protocol was used
to produce images of liposomes. Here, 5000 pairs of MW on resonance
and MW off images, with 20 ms exposure time, were acquired producing
two image stacks. For each stack, single images were generated by
summing corresponding pixel values in all images within each stack.
The final image was produced by dividing the final MWon and MWoff images (Figure 6a,c). Differential interference contrast images were
also acquired for the same fields of view to demonstrate co-localization
of contrast for the Gd3+-labeled liposomes with DIC images
(Figure 6b) and lack
of contrast for the control liposomes (Figure 6d). These findings demonstrate the potential
the sensing protocol introduced here has for wide-field mapping of
endogenous PS produced within the intracellular compartments of live
cells.

Conclusions
A new approach to detection of PS within biological systems is
reported. The sensing protocol exploits the spin-dependent PL properties
of NV– color defects in diamond and uniquely uses
a detection protocol based on successive acquisition of images of
PL with and without MWs. Indeed, the experimental system described
requires small sample volumes (100 fL), operates at room temperature,
and requires a relatively straightforward data acquisition and analysis
procedure. Varying concentrations of PS in aqueous solutions were
detected with a limit of detection for the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol
of less than 10 attomol. Exemplar studies of time-dependent changes
in PS concentration were performed using aliquots of Gd3+ salts with increasing concentration and the chemical conversion
of low-spin cyanide-coordinated Fe3+ to hexaaqua Fe3+ under acidic conditions. Importantly, changes in PS concentration
were detected with a time resolution in the range of tens of ms, essential
for detecting PS concentration changes associated with short-lived
bursts of endogenous PS in living systems. Indeed, the endothelium-derived
relaxation factor (EDRF), also known as nitric oxide (NO•), is estimated to have a half-life ranging from 0.09 s to more than
2 s depending on the oxygen concentration.3 Such detection speed is normally very challenging for relaxometry-based
protocols, which, although provide superior sensitivity to the method
presented here, require more than a second per data point to acquire.42,44

Future work is aimed at elucidation of the mechanism underlying
the presented concentration-dependent contrast observed in the presence
of PS. Previously reported studies of PS using longitudinal spin relaxation
of NV color centers4,43 and recent findings exploiting
coupled charge and spin dynamics to detect PS using NV color centers,53 together with our findings, aid in identifying
the mechanism driving the phenomena observed here. Indeed, it is known
that freely diffusing PS generate magnetic spin noise having a broadband
spectral density extending to the GHz range, with frequency components
corresponding to the NV Larmor precession. As the concentration of
PS increases, so too does the NV relaxation rate, which is in part
due to the concentration-dependent dipole coupling between the PS
and NV. This, in turn, reduces the time-dependent probability of finding
the NV in the |ms = 0⟩ ground state42 and hence reduces the polarizability of the
NV. It is hypothesized that this would lead to a reduction in both
PL intensity and the contrast in PL between MWs on and MWs off contributing
to the effects observed in this work. Charge state dynamics in which
conversion between the NV– and neutral NV charge
state (NVo) occurs may also factor in the contrast observed.
Previous studies report that PS affects PL in a concentration-dependent
manner owing to the interplay between ionization, polarization, and
recombination of charge states. The role of charge state dynamics
in the contrast observed in this study, however, is not clear particularly
as CW optical illumination is used and hence there is no dark time
for the suggested recombination mechanism to occur. While recombination
may not factor in this work, ionization of the NV– charge state may be an important factor particularly owing to the
CW illumination used. Indeed, ionization of NV– is
known to be a function of optical illumination time54 and illumination intensity.55

In spite of this mechanistic uncertainty, the protocol presented
here extends the current state of the art in NV-based sensing, and
with the use of spin traps to stabilize short-lived PS and enable
longer acquisition times, lower limits of detection are achievable
due to improved SNRs. Moreover, this work demonstrates detection of
PS in cell models with subcellular spatial resolution highly relevant
for mapping endogenous PS generation by intracellular compartments.
Overall, this work has introduced and demonstrated an important new
sensing approach for fast, sensitive imaging of PS in a widefield
format, paving the way toward minimally invasive real-time mapping
and observation of free radicals in in vitro cellular environments.
