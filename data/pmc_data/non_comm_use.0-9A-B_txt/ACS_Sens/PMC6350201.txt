In
this work, we report digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) or reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) on a commercial membrane,
without the need for complex chip fabrication or use of specialized
equipment. Due to the pore size distribution, the theoretical error
for digital LAMP on these membranes was analyzed, using a combination
of Random Distribution Model and Multivolume Theory. A facile peel-off
process was developed for effective droplet formation on the commercial
track-etched polycarbonate (PCTE) membrane. Each pore functions as
an individual nanoreactor for single DNA amplification. Absolute quantification
of bacteria genomic DNA was realized with a dynamic range from 11
to 1.1 × 105 copies/μL. One-step digital RT-LAMP
was also successfully performed on the membrane for the quantification
of MS2 virus in wastewater. With the introduction of new probes, the
positive pores can be easily distinguished from negative ones with
100 times difference in fluorescence intensities. Finally, the cost
of a disposable membrane is less than $0.10/piece, which, to the best
of our knowledge, is the most inexpensive way to perform digital LAMP.
The membrane system offers opportunities for point-of-care users or
common laboratories to perform digital quantification, single cell
analysis, or other bioassays in an inexpensive, flexible, and simplified
way.

Digital PCR
(dPCR) has become a promising technologies for absolute quantification
of nucleic acid without need of calibration curves.1 Conventional real-time PCR (qPCR) based on quantification
cycles (Cq) is a relative quantification method, and the absolute
concentration of target templates remains unknown until calibrated
with standard samples. In contrast to qPCR, samples for dPCR quantification
are first partitioned into numerous and separated droplets.2 Each droplet may contain one or no target molecule.
These droplets function as isolated nanoreactors for template amplification,
generating bright fluorescence for single-molecule counting. This
“digital format” eliminates the kinetic variations of
molecular amplification rates, therefore enabling precise, ultrasensitive,
and rapid counting of target molecules.3 Meanwhile, dPCR also reduces device complexity, since only end-point
readout is required (e.g., using a smartphone for imaging).4 Following dPCR, various digital isothermal amplification
methods were also developed which only require isothermal incubation.
Among them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) became the
most popular one, as it is more rapid, sensitive, specific and robust
than others.5

Micro/nanofluidics
has emerged as a highly suitable platform for performing digital nucleic
acid analysis, due to its ability of individual molecule manipulation
and nanoscale fluidic control. Recently, many microfluidic droplet
systems have been reported. For example, water in oil droplets generated
by T-junction,6 flow focusing,7−9 centrifugation,10,11 SAMFS12,13 and XiE14,15 have been applied to dPCR or digital LAMP
(dLAMP) analysis. In addition, dPCR can be achieved using microfluidic
chips with a high density of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or glass
chambers. Sample partition is realized using valves,16 hydrophilic patterns,17,18 vacuum,19−21 pressure,2,22 SlipChip,23 gel,4,24,25 or self-digitization.26 Although many
improvements have been made, these systems typically require elaborate
chip fabrication, modification and complex fluidic control (e.g.,
pump, vacuum, and valve). More importantly, to avoid tedious washing/refabrication
processes and potential contamination, a simple, low-cost, and disposable
device is required that can be thrown away after single use.

Recently, we have fabricated an asymmetric membrane with micropores
on one side and vertically aligned nanochannels on the other side
for single-cell filtration and analysis.27 In this work, we performed a comprehensive study for digital LAMP
on a piece of commercial membrane. Since the presence of pore size
distribution, the theoretical error generated when using this commercial
membrane for digital analysis was first simulated and investigated
in detail, using a combination of the Random Distribution Model and
Multivolume Theory. To completely remove the residual solution on
the membrane surface while keeping sample partitioned inside each
pore, a peel-off process was also developed based on asymmetric capillary
force mechanism. Each pore functions as an individual nanoreactor
for single DNA amplification. Absolute quantification of genomic DNA
was realized from 11 to 1.1 × 105 copies/μL
with a good correlation to the expected results. Next, one-step digital
reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) was also successfully performed
on the membrane to quantify MS2 virus directly in wastewater. Since
all the reported digital LAMP (including digital RT-LAMP) results
have low fluorescence ratio between positive and negative droplets
(usually 3–6), a new primer-dye-primer-quencher duplex fluorescent
probe was adopted here, which could generate 100 times greater differences
between positive and negative pores.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
All LAMP reagents were purchased
from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA), and the primers were from
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) unless otherwise mentioned.
Calcein and MnCl2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Culture media were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific
(San Jose, CA). Track-etched polycarbonate membranes were purchased
from Sterlitech Corporation (Kent, WA) and GVS Filter Technology (USA).
Sylgard 184 silicon elastomer kit consisting of a prepolymer base
and a curing agent was obtained from Dow Corning (Midland, MI). The
PDMS films were prepared by mixing their precursor and curing agent
at a ratio of 10:1 and cured at 75 °C for 1.5 h.28

Bacteria Genomic DNA Extraction
Bacteria were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA). Escherichia coli (ATCC 10798)
and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433) were cultivated
in Luria–Bertani broth in the shaking incubator for ∼14
h at 37 °C. Salmonella Typhi (CVD 909) was cultivated
in tryptic soy broth with 1 mg/L 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate in the incubator
for ∼14 h at 35 °C. Genomic DNA extraction was performed
using a commercial beads-beating tube (GeneRite, NJ), followed by
heating at 95 °C to denature proteins. The precise concentration
of genomic DNA was measured by QX200 droplet digital PCR system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).

MS2 Culture
Coliphage MS2 virions
(ATCC 15597-B1) were cultured with freshly growing E. coli-3000 (ATCC 15597) host suspensions in the Luria–Bertani media
at 37 °C for 36 h. The propagated MS2 suspension was then centrifuged
at 3000g for 4 min to remove the bacterial cells
and debris. The supernatant, containing the MS2 virions, was further
purified using a 0.2 μm syringe filter (GE Whatman, Pittsburgh,
PA). MS2 concentration was quantified by double-agar-layer plaque
assays to determine the titer of virus particles in plaque forming
units per microliter (PFU/μL).29

dLAMP Assay
Here, 25 μL of dLAMP mix contained 1×
isothermal buffer, 6 mM total MgSO4, 1.4 mM dNTP, 640 U/mL Bst 2.0 WarmStart polymerase, primer mix (1.6 μM FIB
and BIP, 0.2 μM F3 and B3, 0.8 μM LF and LB), 1 mg/mL
BSA, 50 μM calcein, 1 mM MnCl2, and 2.5 μL
of template. The primers sequences are shown in Table S1. The selectivity of these certain primers toward
different DNA samples has already been tested and published in previous
works.30−32

dLAMP on Membrane
The PCTE membranes
were used as received. For some commercial PCTE membranes with polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) coating, this hydrophilic coating needs to be removed, since
it affects the LAMP process. PVP removal was accomplished by dipping
the membranes in 10% acetic acid for 30 min, followed by heating to
140 °C for 60 min.33

Digital
LAMP on membrane is illustrated in Figure 1a. Here, 25 μL of LAMP mix was added
on top of the membrane and then sealed between two pieces of PDMS
film. Subsequently, the top PDMS film was peeled off, followed by
adding mineral oil and a frame-seal (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to cover
the whole membrane. The membrane was incubated at 65 °C on a
hot plate (MJ Research PTC-100, Watertown, MA) for 40 min. After amplification,
images of the membranes were taken by a fluorescence microscope (Leica
DMi8, Germany) using the 4× objective. Positive pores were counted
using ImageJ (NIH, MD) software and calibrated by Poisson distribution.
The total number of pores can be counted using ImageJ, since the negative
pores also show a weak fluorescence, or estimated based on the membrane
porosity (1 × 104 pores/cm2). Each sample
was tested for a minimum of three times.

of sample partition on the membrane. (b) Mechanism for excess sample
removal.

qPCR and qLAMP
The 25 μL qPCR mix contained 1× PerfeCTa qPCR ToughMix
(Quanta BioSciences Inc.), 0.25 μM forward primer, 0.25 μM
reverse primer, 0.25 μM TaqMan probe, and 2.5 μL of DNA
template. The primer was targeting the universal bacterial 16s rRNA
gene and their sequences are listed in Table S2. Thermal cycling was performed with Eppendorf RealPlex2 (Hamburg,
Germany). The initialization was 3 min at 95 °C, followed by
40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 30 s at 55 °C
for annealing/extension.

25 μL qLAMP assay contained 1×
WarmStart LAMP Mastermix, primer mix (1.6 μM FIB and BIP, 0.2
μM F3 and B3, 0.8 μM LF and LB), 1× self-contained
dye, and 2.5 μL of template. The reaction was incubated at 65
°C using Eppendorf RealPlex2. Fluorescence intensity of the reaction
was monitored every minute for 60 min.

MS2 Virus Quantification
Using Probes
The assay for MS2 quantification also includes
the RTx reverse transcriptase for one-step digital RT-LAMP. A primer-dye-primer-quencher
duplex was used instead of calcein-Mn2+ indicators.4 The regular FIP primer was substituted with a
fluorophore-labeled primer (5′FAM-FIP) and a complementary
quencher primer (qFIP-3′IBFQ). The final 25 μL reaction
for digital RT-LAMP contained 1× isothermal buffer, 6 mM total
MgSO4, 1.4 mM dNTP, 640 U/mL Bst 2.0 WarmStart
polymerase, 300 U/mL WarmStart RTx reverse transcriptase, primer mix
(1.6 μM 5′FAM-FIB and BIP, 0.2 μM F3 and B3, 0.8
μM LF and LB), 3.2 μM quencher primer qFIP-3′IBFQ,
1 mg/mL BSA, and 2.5 μL of template. The primer sequences for
MS2 RT-LAMP are also shown in Table S1.

Wastewater Samples
The wastewater was collected from the
sedimentation and storage tank of a pilot scale solar-powered mobile
toilet system located on the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
campus. Wastewater is composed of urine, feces, and hand-washing and
toilet-flushing water. Cultured MS2 was spiked in with a final concentration
of 100–1 × 105 PFU/μL. To eliminate the
effect of large pollutants in the sample on the RT-LAMP process, a
double-membrane system was used. A sacrificial commercial PCTE membrane
with 1 μm pore size was placed on top of the 25 μm PCTE
membrane for sample pretreatment. Sample was added to the composite
membranes. After completely wetting, the sacrificial membrane was
thrown away and the bottom membrane (25 μm pore size) was sealed
and incubated at 65 °C, as described above, for digital analysis.

Characterization
Water static contact angle was measured
using a contact angle goniometer equipped with an AmScope Microscope
Camera model MU300. A drop of LAMP mix was placed on the surface of
the membranes. The image was captured 10 s after the drop was placed,
and then analyzed using ImageJ. Top-view and cross-sectional view
SEM images were obtained with a ZEISS 1550VP field emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM). Before analysis, samples were sputtered
with 10 nm Pd.

Results and Discussion
Sample Partition on Membrane
The track-etched membrane is a type of commercial membranes which
contains a high density of micro/nanopores with uniform pore sizes,
ranging from 10 nm to 30 μm.34 In
this work, we chose membranes with a nominal pore size of 25 μm
for experiments. Figure 2a shows a photograph of the commercial PCTE membrane (1.3 cm diameter),
which is transparent and flexible. The membrane has a smooth surface,
and contains a high density of cylindrical pores with an average pore
size of 25 ± 1 μm and a thickness of 27 ± 1 μm,
as confirmed by top-view and cross-sectional view scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 2b,c). Samples can be partitioned on the membrane, as
illustrated in Figure 1a (see Experimental Section for details).
The original PCTE membrane without PVP coating displays a contact
angle of 45 ± 3° for LAMP solutions (Figure 2d). After adding 25 μL of LAMP mix
onto a membrane, the pores become easily wetted due to the capillary
forces, without the need of vacuum. The wetted PCTE membrane was then
sealed between two PDMS films to remove the residue solution on the
membrane surface. However, for solutions with low surface tension
(e.g., containing enzymes, proteins), there was always a thin liquid
film present between the top PDMS and membrane upper surface (see Movie S1). We found this residual liquid could
be removed completely by peeling off the top PDMS film (see Movie S1). The removal mechanism is attributed
to the asymmetric capillary force formed when peeling off PDMS, as
illustrated in Figure 1b.35 Since the pressure difference at
the air–water interface on one side (ΔP1) was always larger than that on the other side (ΔP2), water tends to be taken away by the PDMS
films, even though the liquid showed a very low contact angle. After
PDMS was peeled off, a drop of mineral oil was added to prevent evaporation.
As shown in the fluorescence image (Figure 2e), the sample was indeed partitioned into
each pore successfully. All the pores (100%) were filled up with the
solutions. About 1.7 × 104 droplets of ∼13
pL in volume were formed on a commercial 1.3 cm diameter membrane
within 1 min. The droplets formed in each pore were uniform, as confirmed
by the size and fluorescence distribution results (Figure 2f,g). However, since the pores
on the membranes were produced by random heavy ion irradiation and
subsequent track etching, there is a probability that two or more
pores will overlap, if they are close to each other. The overlapped
pores have almost double volume (see Figure S1), resulting in an error for the digital nucleic acid quantification.
These overlapped pores could be excluded when calculating the results,
since single pores can be easily distinguished from the overlapped
pores, using common software (e.g., ImageJ). However, we prefer to
include all the results for simple calculation, and the resulting
error for DNA quantification will be discussed in the following. The
droplet size, could be easily changed by using membranes with different
pore sizes or thickness. As shown in Figure S2, a high density of droplets of 900 fL and 25 pL in volume were also
successfully formed on commercial membranes with nominal 14 and 30
μm pore size, respectively. We did not test membranes with smaller
pore sizes, due to the resolution limitation of the fluorescence microscope.

Error Analysis
As mentioned above, the overlapped pores
would cause an error in the nucleic acid quantification. Herein, we
analyze this error, using a combination of the Random Distribution
Model and Multivolume Theory. In single-volume systems, where all
droplets have identical volumes, the number of DNA molecules in a
given experiment can be precisely calculated by the Poisson distribution,36 1  where c is the DNA concentration, b is the number of positive droplets, n is the total
number of droplets, and v is the droplet volume.

The track-etched membranes are produced by heavy ion irradiation
and subsequent track etching. Since the irradiation process is random,
there is a probability that two or more pores will overlap, if they
are close to each other. This probability increases as the porosity
increases. The possible number of different kinds of pores on the
membrane, ni (i = 1 denotes
single pores, 2 for two overlapped pores, etc.), can be estimated,
by the following formula based on the total number of pores (ntotal) and porosity (f),37 2  The overlapped pores
have a maximum probability being tangent at the pore edges. Thus,
for a simplified calculation, we assume that the overlapped pores
have same volumes (vi), and are equal
to the sum of each pore (iv1). Therefore, the pores with different volumes can be analyzed
separately.

For a certain input DNA template concentration c, the total number of positive pores can be obtained by
calculating the number of positive pores separately for each kind
of pore, using the Poisson distribution, 3  The measured concentration of template, cx, can be calculated based on the
total number of positive pores (btotal) and the total number of pores (ntotal), 4  where vx is the pore
volume we treated. The relative error between measured concentration
(cx) and input concentration
(c) is defined as 5  Hence, by introducing eqs 2–4 into eq 5, the
relative error can be expressed as 6  Using a Taylor
series, eq 6 can be simplified
as 7  Equation 7 gives the relationship between relative error and input DNA concentration
(c).

In the first case, we assume that the
membrane is a single-volume system, and all the pores have the same
pore volume of vx = v1. In other words, we assume all pores are single
pores without overlap. According to membrane images, porosity (f) was measured to be 0.04, and v1 was measured to be 12.2 pL, respectively. The relationship between
the relative error and the input DNA concentration, c, is shown in Figure 3 (blue line). About 8% error were observed when the input DNA concentration
was below 1 × 104 copies/μL, while the error
drops to 0% at higher DNA concentrations. Indeed, the large error
generated at low DNA concentrations is mainly attributed to the volume
error, since we assume all the overlapped pores to be the single pores.

Figure 3 Relationship
between the relative error and the input DNA concentration.

In the second case, we assume
the membrane is a single-volume system, and all the pores have an
average pore volume. 8  Using the average volume for DNA quantification,
the relationship between the relative error and the input DNA concentrations
is plotted in Figure 3 (red line). Nearly 0% error will occur at target DNA concentrations
below 1 × 104 copies/μL, while approaching −3%
at 1 × 105 copies/μL. Considering the dynamic
range (10–105 copy/μL) of our membrane system,
using an average pore volume for the calculation of DNA concentrations
is more reliable. As all pores have the same depths (membrane thickness),
the average pore volume can be calculated using the average pore size.

In this study, we used the nominal pore size for calculation of
pore volume. The nominal pore size (25 μm) as provided by the
manufacturer was measured by air flow or average bubble point techniques,
which was indeed the average pore size (25 μm). Therefore, the
resulting digital nucleic acid detection on these commercial membranes
would has a relative error less than 3%, which is acceptable for nucleic
acid quantification. If needed, this small error can be further eliminated
by calibrating the results with red line in Figure 3 automatically.

Performance of dLAMP on
Membrane (mdLAMP)
LAMP is an isothermal amplification method
with fast amplification rates and excellent specificity. Therefore,
it is more suitable for nucleic acid detection.5 We first perform real-time LAMP (qLAMP) in tube for DNA
quantification, based on time threshold (Tt) values. The Tt is defined
as the time required for the fluorescence of the LAMP solution to
exceed a given value, similar to Cq in PCR. A smaller Tt value means
higher concentration of target templates in the solution. As shown
in Figure S3, even samples with same DNA
concentration show quite different Tt values each time when qLAMP
were performed. The quantification results can differ by 2 orders
of magnitude. This poor quantification performance may be attributed
to the different amplification rates of the template molecules in
different environments, resulting in a variable Tt value each time.38 This issue can be fully addressed by mdLAMP,
since only end-point counting is required. Digital LAMP on the membrane
was validated using extracted E. coli genomic DNA.
The DNA sample was first mixed with LAMP reagents, and partitioned
on the membrane. During isothermal incubation at 65 °C, each
pore functioned as an isolated nanoreactor for single DNA amplification.
The use of mineral oil and frame-seal prevented the evaporation of
droplets inside pores. To achieve a rapid and robust amplification
on the membrane, the concentration of each component in the LAMP mix,
such as Bst, Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Mg2+, and betaine, was optimized, as illustrated in Figure S4. Figure 4a shows a typical fluorescence image of a membrane after mdLAMP.
The pores containing target DNA exhibited bright fluorescence, while
those without target DNA showed a weak background signal. This result
demonstrates that the commercial PCTE membrane is an excellent biocompatible
material that allows effective amplification of single nucleic acids
in small isolated pores, without need for additional surface modifications.
Even when two pores were very close to each other (Figure 4b,c), cross-contamination was
not observed, conforming perfect pore isolation in our system.

Figure 4 Fluorescence
images of the membrane after mdLAMP. The red circles denote two adjacent
pores with perfect isolation.

To test the quantitative performance of the mdLAMP, a series
of genomic DNA solutions with final concentrations ranging from 11
to 1.1 × 105 copies/μL was used. Figure 5a–e shows the end-point
fluorescence images of the mdLAMP results. With increasing concentration
of target DNA in the samples, more positive pores were observed on
the membranes. The template concentration can be calculated by direct
counting of the positive pores and apply the Poisson distribution.
The relationship between measured concentration and expected concentration
is shown in Figure 5f. The actual concentration was analyzed and verified using the Bio-Rad
QX200 droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) system. The measured concentrations
correspond very well to the expected concentrations (R2 = 0.9998), demonstrating the excellent reliability of
this method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acids. Besides,
mdLAMP was also successfully performed on the membrane with a smaller
pore size (14 μm), as shown in Figure S5. The increased pore density (5 × 104>) and reduced
pore volume (only 900 fL) could help to improve single-molecule detection
efficiency, reduce contamination, increase dynamic range, and enhance
precision.2 While assays with E.
coli served as a model, we also applied the membrane for
the successful detection of specific DNA from Enterococcus
faecalis and Salmonella Typhi, as shown
in Figure S6. It should be noted that the
disposable membrane could be thrown away after single use, avoiding
cross-contamination and tedious washing/refabrication processes. All
results presented above illustrate that mdLAMP offers a simple, low-cost,
and precise method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acids.

MS2 Virus Quantification
via One-Step Digital RT-LAMP with New Probes
One-step digital
RT-LAMP for virus/RNA detection is still challenging and seldom reported.23 Here, the membrane system was further applied
to the quantification of MS2 virus via digital RT-LAMP (mdRT-LAMP).
MS2 virus is a icosahedral, positive-sense single-stranded RNA that
infects the bacterium E. coli and other members of
the Enterobacteriaceae.39 The conventional
plaque assay quantification method requires complicated double-agar
layers, and long incubation times (>36 h) for the growth of host
bacteria and target virus. To detect MS2 virus by membrane system,
8 U/mL Warmstart RTx reverse transcriptase was included in the sample
solution. During 65 °C incubation, the reverse transcription
and LAMP amplification was proceeding simultaneously within each pore.
One disadvantage of digital LAMP or RT-LAMP is the low fluorescence
ratio (usually 3–6) between positive and negative droplets,
making it difficult to distinguish them.7,14,23,26,40 To address this issue, a primer-dye-primer-quencher duplex, was
adopted here instead of conventional calcein-Mn2+ indicators.4 In this case, the forward internal primer (FIP)
is labeled with a fluorophore at the 5′ prime end (5′
FAM-FIP), and its complementary primer is labeled with a quencher
(Iowa Black FQ) at the 3′ end (qFIP-3′IBFQ). Before
LAMP amplification, the probe fluorescence is suppressed by the complementary
primer with a quencher. During the reaction, 5′ FAM-FIPs were
released and incorporated into the LAMP amplicons, generating bright
fluorescence. In contrast, excess unincorporated 5′ FAM-FIPs
are quenched again by the complementary quencher primer qFIP-3′
IBFQs. The resulting fluorescence image for mdRT-LAMP is shown in Figure 6a, exhibiting at
least 100 times higher intensity in positive pores in comparison to
negative ones. In fact, the negative pores had nearly no fluorescence,
and can hardly be distinguished from the background. Poisson distribution
analysis can still be performed, as the total number of pores here
can be calculated based on the membrane porosity. It should be noted
that, although no fluorescence was observed for negative ones, all
these pores were still filled up with samples as checked by bright-field
microscope.

MS2. The red circles indicate the position of negative pores. The
scale bar is 100 μm. (b) Concentration of MS2 detected in wastewater
using plaque assay and mdRT-LAMP.

Measurement of MS2 Virus in Wastewater
To test the performance
on complex water samples, the membrane was applied for MS2 detection
directly in wastewater. The wastewater sample was collected from the
storage tank of a pilot-scale solar-powered mobile toilet system at
the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). More details about
the conditions of the toilet system were reported in previous studies.41,42 Since the wastewater consists of various urine, feces, particles,
bacteria, and hand-washing/toilet-flushing water, the real-time RT-LAMP
was strongly inhibited, as shown in Figure S7. However, the concentration of MS2 spiked inside the wastewater
sample could be precisely quantified using the mdRT-LAMP system. One
advantage of membrane system is the simple capacity of sample pretreatment
by combining different membranes. In order to eliminate the impact
of large pollutants in the wastewater on the RT-LAMP process, a sacrificial
membrane was introduced. The sacrificial PCTE membrane with 1 μm
pore size was placed on top of the original 25 μm membrane.
After adding the human wastewater sample (premixed with RT-LAMP reagents),
both membranes became wetted due to the capillary force. However,
the large particles, feces, and bacteria were retained by the top
sacrificial membrane with 1 μm pore, while the smaller virus
particles and LAMP reagents can pass through and be partitioned into
the underlying membrane with 25 μm pore size. The bottom 25
μm pore membrane was then sealed and incubated at 65 °C,
as described above, for digital analysis. As shown in Figure 6b, 5100 ± 300 copies/μL
of MS2 was detected in the wastewater sample, a slightly larger concentration
than that determined by a traditional plaque assay. This discrepancy
is most likely due to the fact that the plaque assay is a functional
measurement rather than a measurement of the absolute quantity of
viral particles. It has been reported that more than one viral particle
may infect a single host bacterium, and produce only one plaque-forming
unit.43 In contrast, the mdRT-LAMP is an
absolute quantification method that detect target virus at single-molecule
level and resolution.

Comparison with Other Digital Systems
Compared with commercial Bio-Rad digital PCR systems, which are bulky
and expensive (∼$80,000), the mdLAMP system simplified the
whole machine into a small commercial membrane (∼$0.10), showing
potential application in point-of-care detection. Compared with recently
developed digital system using droplets or microchips, the membrane
system is more simple and facile. First, lab users do not need to
enter the cleanroom for complex chip fabrication. Second, the price
for a single membrane is less than $0.10, which is much cheaper than
most microfluidic chips (∼$10). Third, there is no requirement
for syringe pump, centrifuge, vacuum, or other specialized equipment,
while other digital systems usually included these. The disadvantage of the current
membrane system is the high detection limit for nucleic acids (10
copies/μL) due to the small droplet size formed in the membrane.
However, this disadvantage can be easily addressed by combining sample
filtration when we modify DNA-binding sites in the pore of membrane,
like chitosan and aptamer.44

Conclusion
Herein, we report digital LAMP directly on a commercial membrane
without using any specialized equipment or complex chip fabrication
procedures. Approximately 104 uniform picoliter droplets
could be generated on a single membrane within 1 min. Theoretical
calculations using a Random Distribution Model and Multivolume Theory
revealed that a maximum relative error of 3% would be generated when
using these membranes for digital analysis. Absolute quantification
of E. coli, E. faecalis, and Salmonella Typhi DNA was successfully achieved in a dynamic
range from 11 to 1.1 × 105 copies/μL. In addition,
a double-membrane system was applied for the detection of MS2 virus
particles in wastewater, with final quantification results slightly
higher than those obtained by a traditional plaque assay. By using
a new fluorescence probe, the positive pores can be easily distinguished
from negative pores with at least 100 times difference in fluorescence
intensities.

In the future, membranes could be directly sealed
by an adhesive tape to increase the system simplicity. Since many
membranes have been developed for DNA extraction, purification, or
concentration (i.e., Qiagen DNA extraction kits),44 it would be powerful to combine all these features and
digital detection into one piece of membrane. Besides, the mdLAMP
can also be integrated with paper-based analytical devices (μPAD)
for complex sample manipulation and subsequent detection.45−47 The herein presented lab-on-membrane (LOM) system could be further
applied to pathogen quantification, gene sequencing, immunoassays,
and single cell analysis. We believe this simple, novel, low-cost,
and disposable lab-on-membrane system will provide a great platform
for users without expertise in microfluidics.
