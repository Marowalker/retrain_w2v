Bioluminescent sensor
proteins provide attractive tools for applications
ranging from in vivo imaging to point-of-care testing. Here we introduce
a new class of ratiometric bioluminescent sensor proteins that do
not rely on direct modulation of BRET efficiency, but are based on
competitive intramolecular complementation of split NanoLuc luciferase.
Proof of concept for the feasibility of this sensor principle was
provided by developing a blue–red light emitting sensor protein
for the detection of anti-HIV1-p17 antibodies with a 500% change in
emission ratio and a Kd of 10 pM. The
new sensor design also improved the dynamic response of a sensor for
the therapeutic antibody cetuximab 4-fold, allowing the direct quantification
of this anti-EGFR antibody in undiluted blood plasma. The modular
sensor architecture allows easy and systematic tuning of a sensor’s
dynamic range and should be generally applicable to allow rational
engineering of bioluminescent sensor proteins.

==== Body
Optical sensor proteins allow
real-time monitoring of molecular events in complex biological environments,
with applications ranging from intracellular imaging to point-of-care
diagnostics. While fluorescent sensors have become attractive tools
for intracellular imaging, their dependence on external illumination
has hampered applications in strongly absorbing or scattering media
such as blood.1,2 This issue has been successfully
addressed by employing bioluminescent sensor proteins that use a luciferase
to generate light by catalyzing the oxidation of luciferin substrates.3,4 The development of bioluminescent sensor proteins that display a
robust signal change upon ligand binding remains an important molecular
engineering challenge, however. Intensiometric reporter luciferases
have been constructed by insertion of a ligand binding domain within
a conformationally sensitive part of the enzyme or by ligand-induced
complementation of a split luciferase.5−10 The first approach can be cumbersome because of its reliance on
subtle conformational changes, whereas the more modular split luciferase
approach requires at least two sensor parts, rendering its performance
concentration dependent. More importantly, both approaches yield intensiometric
sensors that are not ideal for quantitative measurements, as their
signal intensity depends on many factors including sensor, substrate
and product concentration, pH, temperature, and ionic strength.

Ratiometric bioluminescent sensor proteins based on the modulation
of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between a luciferase
and an acceptor fluorophore are more attractive from this perspective,
as in these sensors the ratio of bioluminescence at two different
wavelengths is used as a measure of ligand binding. A crucial aspect
in the design of robust BRET sensors is the ability to control ligand-induced
switching between a high BRET-state, in which luciferase and the fluorescent
acceptor are in close proximity, and a low BRET-state in which they
are well-separated. Johnsson and co-workers introduced the use of
semisynthetic BRET sensor proteins (LUCIDS) in which intramolecular
complex formation between a fluorescently labeled ligand analogue
and a ligand binding domain is used to create a high BRET state in
the absence of analyte.11−14 Displacement of the tethered fluorescently labeled
ligand by the analyte of interest increases the distance to the luciferase
domain fused to the ligand binding, switching the sensor to a low
BRET state. Despite the intrinsic modularity of this design, each
new receptor domain still requires extensive optimization to ensure
sufficient BRET in the off-state of the sensor. An alternative approach
reported by our group is the use of so-called helper domains to keep
a blue light emitting luciferase domain and a green fluorescent acceptor
in close proximity in the off-state.15−17 This approach was employed
in the development of a sensor platform for antibody detection (LUMABS),
in which bivalent binding of a target antibody disrupts the interaction
of the helper domains, switching the luminescence from green to blue.
However, the helper domains and the fluorescent acceptor domain increase
the distance between donor luciferase and the acceptor fluorophore,
resulting in suboptimal BRET efficiency, in particular for more red-shifted
fluorescent acceptors.

Here we introduce a new class of ratiometric
bioluminescent sensor
proteins that do not rely on modulation of BRET efficiency but are
based on competitive intramolecular complementation of split NanoLuc
luciferase. NanoLuc is a highly stable and bright, blue light producing
luciferase that can be split into two fragments, an 18 kDa large BiT
(LB) and a 1.3 kDa small BiT (SB), which were designed as a binary
complementation reporter to study protein interactions (NanoBiT or
NB).21,22 In our new sensor format (NB-LUMABS) a single
copy of the large fragment (LB) is fused to two copies of the small
fragment (SB) yielding a protein switch that can exist in two conformations,
where either the N- or the C-terminal SB binds to the LB and reconstitutes
luciferase activity (Figure 1). A red-emitting fluorophore is conjugated next to one of
the SBs, permitting efficient BRET and consequently the emission of
red light in only one of the two conformations. Bivalent binding of
an antibody disrupts the intramolecular interaction of the fluorescently
labeled SB, which allows reconstitution of NanoLuc by the nonfluorescently
labeled SB, resulting in a color transition from red to blue. An important
property of the split NanoLuc system is that the affinity between
the LB and SB can be systematically varied between Kd = 0.7 nM and Kd = 190 μM,22 allowing precise tuning of the relative thermodynamic
stabilities of the two alternative conformations.

Figure 1 Design of NB-LUMABS.
(A) Schematic representation of sensor concept.
One large BiT (LB) was fused to two small BiTs (SBs) and a red-emitting
fluorophore (red star) is conjugated next to one of the SBs, enabling
efficient BRET in the antibody-free state. Bivalent binding of an
antibody to the epitopes in the semiflexible linker disrupts the interaction
with SB2, changing the color of emission from red to blue. (B) Illustration

Vina19 and visualized by PyMOL.20 (C) Tunability of split NanoLuc interactions. Kd values are not limited to the listed values.

To establish proof-of-concept
and explore the design constraints
for this new sensor concept, we started by developing NB-LUMABS targeting
the anti-HIV1-p17 antibody, a well-characterized antibody that binds
linear epitopes with high affinity. In our initial design we combined
SB1 with a Kd of 190 μM and SB2
with a Kd of 2.5 μM. The higher
affinity for SB2 was chosen to favor formation of the high-BRET LB-SB2
complex in the absence of antibody, but not too high to prevent activation
of the sensor by bivalent antibody binding. SB1 was connected to the
N-terminus of LB via a flexible (GGS)10 linker, while SB2
was connected to the C-terminus of LB via a semiflexible linker with
the antibody-targeting epitopes at each end of the linker to enable
bivalent binding to the target antibody.15 The synthetic fluorophore Cy3 was chosen as the BRET acceptor as
its emission peak at 565 nm is well separated from that of NanoLuc.
Since BRET efficiency is strongly distance dependent, three constructs
were designed with the fluorophore conjugated at different positions
via cysteine-maleimide labeling. HIV-NB-LUMABS-1 containing one Cy3
molecule next to the N-terminus of SB2 showed efficient BRET in the
initial antibody-free state with the Cy3 peak higher than the NanoLuc
emission (Figure 2A),
suggesting Cy3 was kept in close proximity to the substrate binding
site of NanoLuc. Sensor variants labeled with either one Cy3 molecule
next to C-terminus of SB2 (HIV-NB-LUMABS-2) or two Cy3 molecules at
both the N- and C-termini of SB2 (HIV-NB-LUMABS-3) showed a substantially
lower Cy3 emission peak in the absence of antibody (Figure 2B and C). The decreased BRET
efficiency observed for HIV-NB-LUMABS-3 compared to HIV-NB-LUMABS-1
is remarkable and suggests that conjugation of Cy3 at the C-terminal
position may affect the interaction of SB2 with LB. Titration of HIV-NB-LUMABS-1
with increasing concentrations of anti-HIV1-p17 antibody revealed
a large dynamic range (DR) of 218 ± 12% and an overall dissociation
constant (Kd) of 10.0 ± 0.5 pM (Figure 2D). Since the dissociation
constant for the monovalent antibody–peptide interaction is
42 nM,15 the bivalent interaction between
antibody and the sensor thus resulted in a more than 1000-fold increase
in overall affinity.

We next tested whether the already robust ratiometric response
could be further enhanced by varying the relative affinities of the
split luciferase interactions (Table 1). Increasing the affinity of SB2 from 2.5 μM
to 0.18 μM in HIV-NB-LUMABS-4 resulted in a high emission ratio
in the absence of antibody but a moderate ratio change upon addition
of antibody (Figure 3A). This result shows that the increased affinity of SB2 further
pushes the equilibrium to the high BRET state in the absence of antibody,
yet at the same time also hinders bivalent antibody binding to form
the low BRET state. Sensor variants in which SB1 and SB2 had the same
affinity (HIV-NB-LUMABS-5 and 6, with Kd’s of 190 μM and 2.5 μM, respectively) showed
a strong attenuation of the emission ratio in the absence of antibody
(Figure 3B,C), suggesting
that in this case a substantial fraction resides in the low BRET,
SB1-bound state. The optimal combination of SB1 and SB2 affinities
was found for HIV-NB-LUMABS-7 (SB1: Kd = 2.5 μM; SB2: Kd = 0.18 μM),
which combined an increased emission ratio of 1.8 in the absence of
antibody, with efficient formation of the low-BRET, bivalent antibody-bound
state, yielding a 493 ± 13% change in emission ratio (Figure 3D).

Having established the feasibility
of using split-NanoLuc complementation
as a new sensor principle to generate robust ratiometric bioluminescent
proteins with low pM affinity, we also explored whether the same design
principle could be used to improve the performance of LUMABS targeting
the clinically important anticancer therapeutic antibody cetuximab.
Since cetuximab binds to a discontinuous conformational epitope on
the cancer marker EGFR, no linear epitope sequences are available.
Nevertheless, we recently identified disulfide-linked cyclic meditope
peptides with sufficient affinity to cetuximab and used them to construct
a blue-green emitting LUMABS sensor for cetuximab with a relatively
modest change in emission ratio (DR ∼ 60%).17,23 As the presence of cysteine residues in the meditope peptides precludes
the use of cysteine-maleimide chemistry to introduce the Cy3 dye,
we instead introduced the noncanonical amino acid para-azidophenylalanine (pAzF) to allow site-specific conjugation with
a DBCO-functionalized fluorophore via strain-promoted azide–alkyne
click chemistry (SPAAC). In order to incorporate pAzF, a TAG amber
stop codon was introduced either before the N-terminus (CTX-NB-LUMABS-1)
or after the C-terminus of SB2 (CTX-NB-LUMABS-2) and the anti-HIV1-p17
epitope sequences were replaced by the cyclic cetuximab meditope sequences
(monovalent Kd of 61 nM). Coexpression
with the orthogonal tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for pAzF allowed successful
incorporation of pAzF into the cetuximab sensor variants at the desired
position. Q-ToF LC-MS analysis of the purified proteins (Figure S2) showed partial reduction of pAzF to
4-aminophenyl alanine, which limited the degree of Cy3 labeling to
50–60% (Table S1). Nonetheless,
CTX-NB-LUMABS-1 still showed bright Cy3 emission in the absence of
cetuximab and a significant decrease in emission ratio upon antibody
binding (Figure 4A).
A dynamic range of 233 ± 12% was achieved, representing a 4-fold
improvement compared to the blue-green CTX-LUMABS sensors,17 while an overall Kd of 34.7 ± 3.7 nM obtained from fitting the titration data was
found to be similar (Figure 4B). Introduction of Cy3 at the C-terminus of SB2 in CTX-NB-LUMABS-2
substantially decreased the BRET efficiency in the antibody-free state
(Figure S4), which is consistent with the
results obtained for HIV-NB-LUMABS-2. We also constructed a sensor
variant (CTX-NB-LUMABS-3) containing a cyclic cetuximab meditope with
a weaker affinity (monovalent Kd of 270
nM). Titration experiments with CTX-NB-LUMABS-3 showed a Kd of 189 ± 16 nM, enabling this sensor to reliably
measure high cetuximab concentrations (Figure 4B). The lower affinity of CTX-NB-LUMABS-3
for cetuximab also resulted in a more rapid response compared to that
of CTX-NB-LUMABS-1 (Figure S5). These results
demonstrate that the NB-LUMABS sensor format can be reconfigured to
detect antibodies recognizing disulfide constrained cyclic peptides,
yielding two cetuximab sensors whose combined responsive regime covers
the clinically relevant cetuximab concentration range (25 nM –
2.3 μM).24

(top) and CTX-NB-LUMABS-3 (bottom) with varying cetuximab concentration
taken by a digital camera. The red lines in B and D represent the
best fits to eq 1 (SI). The shaded area
represents the physiologically relevant concentration range.

As an important step toward point-of-care
application, we tested
whether the bioluminescent signal could be detected by a simple digital
camera instead of a dedicated plate reader. Due to the lower enzymatic
activity of NanoBiT compared to intact NanoLuc the bioluminescent
intensity of NB-LUMABS is less than that of LUMABS (Figure S6), but its brightness was still sufficient to be
detected by a digital camera using only 100 pM of sensor. Moreover,
the change in color from red-to-blue is more easily recognized compared
to the green-to-blue transition of CTX-LUMABS (Figures 4B and S7). Image
analysis software (ImageJ) was used to determine the average intensity
in the red and blue color channels and the calculated red/blue ratio
was plotted as function of antibody concentration. The Kd values determined by camera-based measurements matched
well with those obtained using the plate reader (Figure 4C, Table S2). Finally, the performance of NB-LUMABS was tested in undiluted
blood plasma. Although the absolute intensity of the emitted light
was lower in blood plasma than that in buffer, the dynamic ranges
and apparent affinities were found to be comparable to those obtained
in buffer (Figure 4D, Figure S8, Table S2). Detection of the antibody-dependent color changes using
a digital camera again yielded comparable results with plate-reader-based
recording (Table S2).

In conclusion,
a new class of ratiometric bioluminescent sensors
has been developed that uses competitive intramolecular complementation
of a split luciferase as an attractive alternative to the classical
BRET sensor design. The new sensor format significantly improved the
performance of previously reported LUMABS antibody sensors, allowing
the use of a red-shifted acceptor and showing a large change in emission
ratio to detect picomolar concentrations of antibody directly in solution.
The intrinsic modularity of the sensor design not only allows easy
and systematic tuning of the sensor’s dynamic range and antibody
specificity, but also represents a generic design to construct ratiometric
bioluminescent sensor proteins for applications ranging from in vivo
imaging to developing cheap paper-based point-of-care diagnostics25 for a wide range of molecular analytes.
