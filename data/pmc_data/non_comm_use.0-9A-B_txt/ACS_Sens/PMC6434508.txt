Photoacoustic
(optoacoustic) imaging can extract molecular information
with deeper tissue penetration than possible by fluorescence microscopy
techniques. However, there is currently still a lack of robust genetically
controlled contrast agents and molecular sensors that can dynamically
detect biological analytes of interest with photoacoustics. In a biomimetic
approach, we took inspiration from cuttlefish who can change their
color by relocalizing pigment-filled organelles in so-called chromatophore
cells under neurohumoral control. Analogously, we tested the use of
melanophore cells from Xenopus laevis, containing compartments (melanosomes) filled with strongly absorbing
melanin, as whole-cell sensors for optoacoustic imaging. Our results
show that pigment relocalization in these cells, which is dependent
on binding of a ligand of interest to a specific G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR), can be monitored in vitro and in vivo using photoacoustic
mesoscopy. In addition to changes in the photoacoustic signal amplitudes,
we could furthermore detect the melanosome aggregation process by
a change in the frequency content of the photoacoustic signals. Using
bioinspired engineering, we thus introduce a photoacoustic pigment
relocalization sensor (PaPiReS) for molecular photoacoustic imaging
of GPCR-mediated signaling molecules.

==== Body
Photoacoustic
(optoacoustic)
imaging is based on the photoacoustic effect—the conversion
of absorbed light energy into heat, causing the generation of acoustic
waves that can be captured by ultrasound detectors.1 Over recent years, the optoacoustic imaging technique has
been increasingly used in biomedicine because of its advantageous
combination of optical and ultrasound imaging, decoupling the underlying
mechanisms of contrast and spatial resolution. On the one hand, optoacoustic
imaging relies on photoabsorption-based contrast, allowing for rich
optical differentiation of photoabsorbing molecules such as exogenous
contrast agents or endogenous tissue chromophores.2 On the other hand, optoacoustic imaging achieves penetration
depths of millimeters or even centimeters at high ultrasonic resolutions
because of the weak acoustic scattering in tissue.

In general,
the acoustic signals measured in photoacoustics contain
a broad range of ultrasonic frequencies. The size of the imaged photoabsorbers
governs the frequency content of the photoacoustic signal: smaller
absorbers generate higher photoacoustic frequencies than larger absorbers.
For example, a spherical absorber with 20 μm diameter generates
frequencies up to ∼100 MHz, while a 10 μm absorber produces
frequencies as high as ∼200 MHz.3

Furthermore, high frequencies experience stronger acoustic
attenuation
than lower frequencies,4 leading to an
inverse relationship of highest measurable frequency and thus achievable
spatial resolution with imaging depth. Because of this relationship,
optoacoustic imaging is a highly scalable modality regarding spatial
resolution and imaging depth. Recently, we have introduced raster-scan
optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) in epi-illumination mode, offering imaging
depths of several millimeters and a lateral and axial resolution of
20–30 μm and ∼5 μm, respectively,5 thereby bridging the gap between macroscopic
and microscopic optoacoustic imaging modalities.

Up to now,
contrast generation for optoacoustic imaging has mostly
relied on utilizing endogenous chromophores or externally administered
photoabsorbers such as organic dyes or nanoparticles.2 With respect to genetically encoded contrast agents for
optoacoustic imaging, overexpression of (reversibly switchable) fluorescent
proteins that absorb in the visible or infrared range have been explored,
in which either cyclized amino acids or cofactors such as biliverdin
act as the chromophore.6−9 Alternatively, biosynthetic pigments such as melanin and violacein
have been utilized as contrast agents, which are beneficial because
of their generally higher photobleaching resistance, enzymatic amplification
of the genetic signal, and potentially higher local concentrations
as compared to chromoproteins.10,11 The advantages of melanin
are that it is synthesized in a monoenzymatic reaction and that it
yields strong and broad absorption over the visible range extending
into the near-infrared.12 Moreover, melanin
exhibits a fluorescence quantum yield of less than 1% thereby maximizing
heat generation by nonradiative decay, a prerequisite for photoacoustic
signal generation.12 For cell types that
endogenously produce and sequester melanin such as melanophores, it
represents an excellent contrast agent for optoacoustic imaging that
has, for instance, enabled volumetric tracking of melanophore migration
during zebrafish development.13 If melanin
production is not compartmentalized, however, it has been shown to
be toxic in standard cell lines.14 In melanophores,
melanin is stored in specialized organelles that are transported inside
the cell along its microtubular cytoskeletal network, referred to
as melanosomes.

Certain animals such as chameleons and cuttlefish
are able to adjust
their skin color to the environment by translocating the melanosomes
within melanophores, which is mediated by neuronal and hormonal inputs.15 This impressive behavior is used for camouflage
to hide from predators and in the case of the cuttlefish may also
be used as means of communication.16 Forms
of camouflage have been reported also in the common laboratory fish
model zebrafish (Danio rerio). If a
zebrafish is on a dark background, its melanophores disperse their
melanosomes, leading to a darker appearance of the melanized fish
skin. Conversely, aggregation of melanosomes around the nucleus of
the melanophores triggered by bright background colors results in
a lighter appearance of the animal.17 Classical
neurohumoral molecules are involved in regulating this melanosome
relocalization within melanophores. These include the pituitary-derived
melanin-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which induces melanosome
dispersion, and the hypothalamus-derived melanin-concentrating hormone
(MCH),17−19 which induces melanosome aggregation. Other hormones
that influence melanosome translocation include melatonin,20,21 catecholamines such as noradrenaline,15,22 and serotonin.23 The mechanism of action of these molecules is
realized via binding to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) expressed
on the cell surface of melanophores, which modulates the intracellular
levels of cyclic adenosine 3′-5′-monophosphate (cAMP)
and calcium. These secondary messengers ultimately control melanosome
relocalization inside the cell through actions on the cytoskeletal
transport machinery.24,25 Inspired by the cellular melanosome
aggregation and dispersion process and by the ideal photophysical
properties of melanin, we were interested in how the reversible relocalization
of strongly photoabsorbing pigments within melanophores could be exploited
as a dynamic contrast mechanism for molecular optoacoustic imaging.
To this end, we selected an immortalized melanophore cell line from
the frog Xenopus laevis that has been
successfully used as a robust in vitro readout to study complex GPCR-mediated
signaling transduction pathways.26 By monitoring
the absorbance changes due to melanosome relocalization in a convenient
plate reader format, this methodology contributed to the characterization
of important neuroendocrine pathways, activated, for example, by the
pineal hormone dopamine26 and melatonin.27

Both Xenopus laevis and zebrafish
are cold-blooded animals and are cultured at similar temperatures.
Therefore, we explored whether xenografting wildtype or genetically
modified frog melanophore cell lines into zebrafish could be employed
as a whole-cell photoacoustic sensor for GPCR ligands. In distinction
to the well-known CNiFER sensors28 that
detect a specific GPCR ligand such as glutamate via a downstream fluorescent
calcium indicator signal in xenografted human embryonic kidney (HEK)
cells, photoacoustics could directly image melanosome relocalization
via changes in the photoacoustic signal amplitudes. For gold and melanin-like
nanoparticles, it has already been demonstrated that an aggregation
of the nanoparticles can lead to an increase of photoacoustic signal
amplitude probably due to overlapping transient thermal fields surrounding
the nanoparticles.29,30 In addition, we reasoned that
pigment relocalization should be detectable by shifts in the photoacoustic
frequencies above 10 MHz because the average size of the imaged photoabsorbing
objects is altered by the melanophore dynamics. Changes of photoacoustic
frequencies have been used to study aggregation and morphological
changes of red blood cells in microscopic settings in vitro.31,32 A demonstration on intracellular pigment dynamics in vivo would
establish the frequency content of photoacoustic signals as a new
observable for the high-resolution photoacoustic sensing of dynamic
molecular processes in live animals.

For the optoacoustic 3D
monitoring of melanophore dynamics, we
selected the RSOM modality as it combines a number of advantages over
traditional optical imaging systems. First, RSOM achieves the necessary
spatial resolution to resolve single melanophores and to track changes
in the absorptive volume of the imaged cells. Second, RSOM relies
on widefield laser illumination and acoustic focusing (as opposed
to optical focusing), being less prone to pigment shadowing than pure
optical modalities. Third, the range of photoacoustic frequencies
detectable via RSOM (>200 MHz) is high enough to capture frequency
shifts generated by changes in absorber size in the range of approximately
10–40 μm brought about by melanosome relocalization.17

Combining engineered melanophore cells
with RSOM, we introduce
here a new reversible contrast mechanism for molecular imaging with
photoacoustics based on the relocalization of pigments in response
to analytes of interest. Such a photoacoustic pigment relocalization
sensor (PaPiReS) is distinct from sensors that change their color
in response to analytes of interest33−35 because the absorbance
spectrum of the pigments does not change. In addition, we show how
GPCR signaling can be mapped with optoacoustic imaging and how a change
in the frequency content of photoacoustic signals can be used as a
reversible sensor readout.

Results
Melanophore Aggregation
during Background Adaptation and upon
MCH Treatment in Zebrafish Larvae Can Be Detected with RSOM
To test the feasibility of detecting GPCR-mediated pigment relocalization
in engineered melanophores, we first asked whether optoacoustic mesoscopy
could detect naturally occurring pigment relocalization in melanophores
during background adaptation of zebrafish. To this end, we induced
pigment dispersion in melanophores of zebrafish larvae by adapting
them to a dark environment for ∼16 h. Subsequently, we kept
the larvae on a black background while imaging them using epi-illumination
RSOM (Figure 1a; Supplementary Figure S1). Exposing the fish to
a combination of a white background and light illumination for 30
min triggered melanophore aggregation as observed with RSOM (Figure 1b). Because of their
high content of melanin, eyes were easily recognized in the photoacoustic
images, which were obtained by projecting the 3D reconstructions of
the fish along the depth dimension (z-axis), representing
maximum intensity projections (MIP) in top view (Figure 1a,b). As expected, melanophores
along the body also produced good photoacoustic contrast. Several
stripes were visible in the photoacoustic image of the fish in the
control state comprising identifiable melanophore clusters or single
cells (Figure 1a, white
arrows in the inset).

as labeled in (a) and (b). (e) Quantification of the melanosome aggregation
effect for the two conditions and imaging modalities shown in (a)–(d)
(mean pigmented area normalized to the maximum of each modality ±
SEM from 19 cells (BF) or 9 clusters of cells (RSOM)). A significantly
reduced pigmented area was observed after light background adaptation
with both RSOM and BF (paired t test, *** indicates p < 0.001). (f) Difference in photoacoustic signal cumulative
power spectra (CPS) normalized to the CPS peak value of the control
measurement. The light blue curve shows the difference between the
CPS obtained from the light background adapted fish and the dark-adapted
fish. The gray curve represents the CPS obtained from the dark-adapted
fish.

In fish adapted to a white background,
regions with a prominent
reduction in the pigmented area could be distinguished in the photoacoustic
images (white arrows in the insets of Figure 1b as compared to Figure 1a). Moreover, because of the deep tissue
penetration achieved by RSOM, we were able to observe melanosome aggregation
also at different depths and from different angles of the three-dimensional
reconstruction. This allowed us to discern pigment patterns otherwise
disguised in single depth-projection images. A full 360° rotation
of the 3D reconstruction of the imaged zebrafish before stimulation
is shown in Supplementary Movie S1. Subsequent
to the photoacoustic measurement session, we repeated the background
adaptation experiments with the same fish under a brightfield (BF)
microscope (Figure 1c,d). Even though the low contrast of the brightfield images prevented
a detailed study of the melanosome aggregation effect, we could identify
responding melanophores at similar locations along the anterior-posterior
(A-P) axis of the fish as in the photoacoustic images (insets in Figure 1c,d).

To quantify
and compare the melanophore aggregation response as
captured by photoacoustic and brightfield imaging, we performed a
manual segmentation of the regions shown in the respective insets
(Figure 1a–d),
which yielded a significant reduction in the mean pigmented area by
38% (±3.1%, standard error of the mean (SEM)) due to white background
adaptation under the brightfield microscope (paired t test, p-value: 7.6× 10–8, n = 19) and by 33% (±4.7%) under RSOM imaging
(paired t test, p-value: 0.0003, n = 9; Figure 1e). These data demonstrate that the imaging conditions in RSOM are
sufficiently gentle and do not interfere with the background adaptation
behavior of the fish.

Generally, smaller photoabsorbers should
generate higher photoacoustic
frequencies. Therefore, we set out to assess next, whether the dynamic
process of melanosome aggregation is reflected in the frequency spectra
of the recorded photoacoustic data. First, to study the effect of
the melanosome aggregation state on photoacoustic frequencies, we
carried out simulations of contracting and expanding absorbers and
calculated the difference spectra of the resulting photoacoustic frequency
distributions (Supplementary Figure S4).
In the case of contracting absorbers, the difference spectra yielded
distinct bipolar shapes with a low-frequency minimum and a high-frequency
peak (Supplementary Figure S4a), whereas
the shapes corresponding to expanding absorbers are inverted (Supplementary Figure S4b). Hence, melanosome aggregation
is expected to be reflected by a distinct bipolar difference spectrum
of photoacoustic frequencies.

In the next step, we performed
a frequency analysis of the photoacoustic
data recorded by RSOM from the zebrafish during background adaptation.
To this end, we summed up the frequency spectra of all potentially
melanin-related signals across the entire photoacoustic data set to
obtain the cumulative power spectra (CPS) for both light-adapted or
dark-adapted conditions. The CPS of the fish measured in darkness
exhibited a maximum at ∼38 MHz (gray curve in Figure 1f). The difference spectrum
of the CPS relative to the white and the dark background adapted fish
showed a negative peak at ∼30 MHz and a high-frequency excess
above ∼100 MHz (represented by the light blue curve in Figure 1f). The shape of
the CPS difference spectrum obtained after the background adaptation
experiment matches the bipolar shapes of the simulated frequency spectra
for absorbers contracting from 20 to 10 μm or 10 to 5 μm
in diameter (blue and orange curves in Supplementary
Figure S4a, respectively), which is in good agreement with
the typical sizes of melanophores present in zebrafish.17 This result indicates a shift from low to high
frequencies as a consequence of a reduction in the average absorber
size present in the living specimens.

Whereas these changes
in the global frequency distributions were
obtained from the entire scanned volume, we were next interested whether
different regions along the A-P axis with strong frequency shifts
corresponded to regions with a prominent reduction of the pigmented
areas. Therefore, we mapped out the magnitude of melanophore aggregation
via a position-dependent analysis of the amplitude and frequency-shift
information on the photoacoustic signals. To this end, we segmented
melanophore clusters in the trunk region in the dark and white background
adapted states of the imaged zebrafish larva and compared the pigmented
areas. For visualization, we colored the segmented clusters of the
dark-adapted fish according to the magnitude of area change such that
red, orange and yellow colors correspond to a change of more than
10%, 23%, and 30%, respectively (Supplementary
Figure S2a). To visualize position-dependent frequency shift
magnitudes, we performed the above-described frequency analysis at
each position in the xy-plane (Supplementary Figure S2b,c) of the reconstructions for a neighborhood
of 13 × 13 z-signals. The peak values of the
CPS difference spectra are displayed in the frequency shift map in Supplementary Figure S2b (as compared to the photoacoustic
MIP of the dark-adapted larva in Figure 1).

We noted that the most significant
contribution of frequency shifts
originated from the trunk region, whereas only little changes occurred
in the head region. Furthermore, we could identify three regions of
strong frequency change, as well as a larger area of weaker frequency
shift (white and red arrows in Supplementary Figure
S2b, respectively). Because single cells or small cell clusters
were not easily detectable in the head region, segmentation was not
performed there (“not segm.” in Supplementary Figure S2a). When comparing the
maps in the trunk region, a correlation between higher and lower magnitudes
of frequency shift and stronger and weaker area changes could be identified.
The clusters showing a reduction in the pigmented area of more than
23% and 30% were the ones that likely contributed the most to the
global frequency shift observed after the adaptation to a white background
(Figure 1).

The
experiments carried out in zebrafish larvae showed that (i)
RSOM can detect the dynamic process of melanin relocalization naturally
occurring inside melanophores of live larvae (Figure 1a,b, Figure 2c,d, Supplementary Figure 2), and that (ii) RSOM acquisition does not interfere with the reversible
pigment clustering process as shown by reproducing the results on
the same individual after the RSOM measurement (Figure 1c,d).

and after exposure to
MCH. (a,b) Top-view MIPs of a zebrafish larva imaged with RSOM before
(a) and after (b) 45 min of exposure to 100 μM of MCH dissolved

of the trunk region delineated by the white dashed boxes. White arrows
highlight regions of prominent melanosome aggregation. (c) Differences
in photoacoustic cumulative power spectra (CPS) normalized to the
control CPS peak value. The dark blue curve shows the difference between
the CPS obtained after 20 min of treatment with MCH and the CPS of
the control condition. The light blue curve shows the same analysis
for 45 min of treatment with MCH. The CPS of the control condition
is shown in gray color as a reference.

Next, to investigate whether hormone-induced melanophore
aggregation
could also be detected using RSOM, we tested larvae pigmentation upon
delivery of MCH on live zebrafish, which is known to induce a visible
aggregation of melanosomes in these animals.36 Upon stimulation with MCH, the imaged melanophore size was reduced
by 19% (±4.2%) (white arrows in the insets of Figure 2a,b, paired t-test, p-value <0.001, n = 13).

Again, we tested whether a global frequency change was discernible
before and after either 20 or 45 min of exposure to MCH. We observed
that the CPS of the control condition featured a maximum at ∼45
MHz (gray curve in Figure 2c). The difference spectra of the CPS for the two different
durations of MCH treatment (control condition subtracted) are illustrated
in Figure 2c by the
dark blue curve (20 min of MCH treatment) and the light blue curve
(45 min of MCH treatment). Again, both curves match the simulation
results for contracting absorbers (Supplementary
Figure S4a) and show a pronounced negative peak at ∼30
MHz as well as a positive plateau in the 50–140 MHz range,
indicating a shift from low to high frequencies upon melanosome aggregation
in a similar regime as observed for the background adaptation experiment.
Furthermore, we noted that the longer MCH treatment curve exhibits
a similar frequency profile, albeit with higher peak-to-peak amplitude,
indicating a stronger aggregation response due to the longer stimulation
time.

RSOM Imaging of Hormone-Triggered Melanosome Aggregation in
Cultured Melanophores
Next, we set out to investigate whether
GPCR-mediated aggregation of melanosomes and the subsequent reduction
of the pigmented area observable via optoacoustic mesoscopy could
be employed to resolve melanophore responses in deep tissue. This
capability could then be used to image xenotransplanted cells that
could be genetically engineered to function as a whole-cell sensor
for photoacoustics, similarly to the catecholamine sensors for light
microscopy developed by the Kleinfeld laboratory.28 Hence, we first explored the RSOM detection of melanosome
aggregation in a well-established immortalized cell line from Xenopus laevis. These cells exhibit relatively large
sizes in the range of 50–100 μm and have been previously
employed as a cell-based sensor using GPCR signaling in vitro by simple
monitoring of absorbance changes in a plate reader format.26,37 Exposure to MCH induced a significant melanosome aggregation response
of frog melanophores, as seen in brightfield microscopy (Figure 3a–d), with
the majority of melanosomes relocating around the nucleus. A low density
of the frog melanophores was used such that individual cells could
be differentiated for convenient segmentation and quantification of
the reduction in the mean pigmented area, which was found to be 58%
(±5.3%) (Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank test, p-value: 2 × 10–5, n = 25).

subset of cells shown in (a) and (b). The cell identities are indicated
with colored dots, whereas the cell membranes are delineated by dashed
lines. A reduced pigmented area by 58% was observed as compared to
the control image (Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank test, p-value <0.0001, n = 25). (e,f) RSOM
imaging of cultured frog melanophores before (e) and after (f) exposure
to 30 μM of MCH, which triggered melanosome aggregation. The
images show top-view MIPs of the RSOM measurement of the cell layer,
while the insets represent magnifications of the regions delineated
by the dashed boxes. Upon MCH stimulation, the overall pigmented area
was found to be reduced by 22% as compared to the control measurement
(paired t test, p-value: 0.006, n = 10).

Using the same parameters, we
next imaged the frog melanophores
with RSOM and could clearly differentiate the dispersed state (vehicle
control, Figure 3e)
from the aggregated state after MCH stimulation (Figure 3f; reduction in size by 22%
(±5.5%), paired t test, p-value:
0.006, n = 10; please note that the contrast is inverted
as compared to the BF images because highly absorbing structures give
strong photoacoustic signals.) Remarkably, the resolution of the RSOM
system was sufficient to even distinguish single frog melanophores
and their nuclei as seen by the absence of signal in the center of
the cells (insets in Figure 3e,f).

Wildtype Frog Melanophores Xenotransplanted
into the Brains
of Zebrafish Respond to Melatonin
Encouraged by the clear
contrast changes observed by RSOM in vitro, we next sought to test
whether GPCR-mediated pigment relocalization in frog melanophores
could also be detected in vivo. We thus transplanted cultured frog
cells into the midbrain of juvenile zebrafish. To ensure engraftment
of the cells, we performed the transplantation in immunocompromised
fish mutants (homozygous rag2E450 fs on a casper background38).

As can be seen in the photoacoustic top-view MIP
of the imaged fish (Figure 4a), the individual xenotransplanted cells (orange color map,
manually segmented) could clearly be differentiated from each other
and from endogenous structures of the fish such as the pigmented eyes
(blue color map) by virtue of the absence of photoacoustic background
signals in the head region. The identification of transplanted cells
and endogenous structures (e.g., fish eyes) in the photoacoustic images
was also confirmed by the corresponding BF image of the head region
of the same fish (inset in Figure 4a, transplanted melanophores marked by red arrows).
After stimulating the xenotransplanted melanophores by bathing the
fish in 100 nM of melatonin for 30 min, we were able to pick up a
melanosome aggregation response of the cells by observing a clear
reduction of their pigmented areas by 30% (±9.5%) in the photoacoustic
images (Figure 4b,c,
paired t test, p-value: 0.008, n = 12).

ex vivo after the stimulation experiment showing a side-view MIP of
the 3D reconstruction. Cyan color: native cells and eyes. Orange color:

Furthermore, the tomographic capabilities of the RSOM technique
enabled us to study the triggered pigment relocalization effect in
3D. The cells appeared distributed throughout a limited depth of ∼300
μm of the fish brain (90° side views, Figure 4d-e) and were clearly separated
from the eyes and more posterior signals in the skin. Without the
melatonin stimulation, no change in the imaged cell volumes was observed
in repeated control images of a single transplanted Xenopus melanophore in a living zebrafish larva.
Furthermore, consecutive measurements of a single transplanted 10
μm black polystyrene microsphere did not show any substantial
changes in the respective images, demonstrating the stability of the
imaging system (Supplementary Figure S3).

In addition to analyzing the signal amplitudes in the photoacoustic
images, we performed a frequency analysis of the photoacoustic signals
derived from the xenotransplanted melanophores. The difference spectrum
obtained from the CPS of the volume delineated by the white dashed
lines in Figure 4e
during the control and melatonin-stimulated condition (control spectrum
subtracted) is shown as a blue curve in Figure 4f. A local regression fit is plotted in red
color, while the CPS of the measurement before stimulation is shown
in gray color as a reference. The difference spectrum exhibits a clear
bipolar shape with a low-frequency minimum and a high-frequency excess,
indicating a shift toward higher photoacoustic frequencies as a result
of the stimulated melanosome aggregation. Subsequent to the RSOM imaging,
the fish was scanned using a multiorientation implementation of the
RSOM technique (MORSOM),39 serving as a
high-fidelity anatomical reference (Figure 4g). In MORSOM, the sample is rotated and
scanned with the RSOM technique repeatedly from multiple angles, yielding
an isotropic spatial resolution orthogonal to the sample rotation
axis. This resulted in an improved 3D visualization of the imaged
structures (a 360° rotation of the reconstructed specimen imaged
with MORSOM is shown in Supplementary Movie S2).

Engineered Whole-Cell Photoacoustic Sensor for an Orthogonal
GPCR Ligand
After having established that RSOM achieves sufficient
spatial resolution and sensitivity using xenotransplanted melanophores
responding to submicromolar concentrations of melatonin in zebrafish,
we were next interested whether this contrast mechanism could be generalized
to other GPCR-ligands. Therefore, we overexpressed the designer receptor
hMD4i-2A-eGFP (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer
drugs, DREADD)40,41 in frog melanophores. hMD4i is
a Gi-coupled receptor, engineered such that, when activated by the
orthogonal agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO), it causes a reduction
of the intracellular levels of cAMP.40 Given
the physiological response of the melanophores to the Gi signaling,24,25 we predicted that activation of this receptor should induce pigment
aggregation in our cultured melanophores (Figure 5a), as was indeed observed in vitro (Figure 5b). In a proof-of-principle
experiment, cells expressing the hMD4i-2A-eGFP were selected and enriched
via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (“p4”
in Figure 5c) and subsequently
xenotransplanted into rag2E450 fs mutant zebrafish. We could again detect the engineered engrafted
hMD4i-2A-eGFP+ cells in the head region (Figure 5d,e, orange color map, green dotted boxes)
with very low background signals in RSOM. Subsequent administration
of CNO then resulted in a reduction of the melanized area of the transplanted
cells by 13% (±5.6%) mirroring the response observed in vitro,
although statistical significance was not reached (paired t test, p-value: 0.39, n = 3) due to the small number of cells implanted.

Discussion
We
have shown that melanophore dynamics can be mapped in vivo by
optoacoustic mesoscopy noninvasively in deep tissue with cellular
resolution. In addition to the high contrast derived from the photoacoustic
signal amplitudes, we could also demonstrate that the frequency content
of the photoacoustic signals can be utilized to identify the activation
states of melanophores in vivo.

The epi-illumination RSOM modality
employed in this work has been
proven to be particularly suitable for the noninvasive monitoring
of 3D melanophore aggregation in living zebrafish. RSOM yielded sufficient
contrast and spatial resolution to visualize individual melanophores
in 3D and was confirmed to not impede melanophore activity of zebrafish
during imaging. The analysis of photoacoustic frequency shifts consistently
revealed the occurrence of melanosome aggregation in the imaged specimens,
both in analyses of the entire imaging volumes and in a spatially
resolved manner. The frequency distribution of the photoacoustic signal
could, therefore, constitute a valuable additional observable for
studying dynamic cellular processes via photoacoustics in vivo. We
have furthermore complemented the RSOM imaging with the recently developed
MORSOM approach that yielded isotropic spatial resolution in the plane
perpendicular to the sample rotation axis, thus facilitating the anatomical
identification of transplanted cells albeit at the cost of longer
acquisition time.

After establishing the suitability of RSOM
for monitoring 3D melanophore
dynamics in living fish, we used this modality to demonstrate a new
biomimetic sensor mechanism based on dynamic pigment relocalization
within bioengineered melanophores. These dynamic cell sensors provided
robust photoacoustic contrast due to the strong absorbance and high
photobleaching resistance of melanin. We showcased this mechanism
by the high-sensitivity detection of melatonin, which is a critical
molecular signaling molecule involved in circadian rhythm. We furthermore
provided a proof-of-principle demonstration of how this sensor mechanism
could be generalized to other GPCR ligands by genetically installing
a response to the orthogonal DREADD ligand clozapine. Responses to
other GPCR ligands of interest could be engineered analogously by
expressing the respective GPCRs and ablating undesired GPCR inputs.
Instead of xenografting melanophores into host organisms, melanophores
could in principle also be genetically modified in situ to be responsive
in a host organism such as zebrafish. It is also conceivable that
the pigment relocalization mechanism is generalized to other contractile
cells, such as smooth muscle cells. The principle could alternatively
be realized in a system consisting of synthetic or genetically encoded
photoabsorbing nanostructures functionalized on their surface with
moieties that change their agglomeration state as a function of an
analyte of interest.

In summary, we introduced a photoacoustic
relocalization sensor
(PaPiReS) mechanism for molecular photoacoustic imaging based on the
dynamic relocalization of pigments with a fixed absorption spectrum
as opposed to a complementary mechanism based on a color change of
photoabsorbing molecules. We could also demonstrate how the frequency
content in photoacoustic signals can be utilized to derive spatially
resolved information about melanophore dynamics in vivo to obtain
molecular information with optoacoustic imaging. This work furthermore
constitutes the first demonstration of a photoacoustic sensor system
for signal transduction via the important class of GPCRs. The biomimetic
sensor mechanism disclosed herein can be generalized to other ligands
or stimuli and different cell systems with mobile chromophores. PaPiReS
could be used for multiplexing via spectral decomposition of different
pigments and could also be combined with sensors based on chromic
agents to substantially enrich the palette of molecular sensors for
optoacoustic imaging.

Materials and Methods
Frog Melanophores
Cell Culture and Hormonal Treatments
Immortalized melanophores
from Xenopus laevis (B27 cell line,
a kind gift from Dr. M. Lerner, Harvard Medical
School) were propagated as previously described37 in fibroblast-conditioned medium (CFM) containing 50 μg/mL
of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). For the imaging experiments, the cells
were seeded in 35 mm tissue culture plates and cultured for 8–10
days before the experiment. The cells were washed in 0.7× phosphate
buffer saline (PBS, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and then
starved in 0.7× L15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.)
between 10 and 14 h prior to imaging. To induce melanosome aggregation,
cells were washed twice in PBS and subsequently treated with 30 μM
of rat MCH for 40 min.

Zebrafish Maintenance and Preparation
Zebrafish larvae
were bred and maintained according to standard conditions.42 The fertilized eggs from wildtype AB strain casper or rag2E450 fs mutant fish were raised in embryo medium at 28 °C. All
procedures involving animals and their care conformed to the institutional
guidelines.

Background Adaptation Experiment in Zebrafish
Larvae
First, 5-day-old larvae were raised in the dark for
∼16 h
and kept in the dark during the mounting procedure and prior to RSOM
imaging. For imaging, the fish were embedded in 1% low melting agarose.
Two fish were scanned simultaneously. First, the specimens were imaged
in darkness and in front of a black background. Subsequently, the
fish were exposed to bright light for 30 min while facing a white
background. This condition was kept during the second RSOM scan.

MCH Mediated Melanosome Aggregation Experiments in Zebrafish
Larvae
The larvae were raised in a standard light/dark cycle
and embedded in 1% low melting agarose. To elicit melanophore aggregation,
the fish were treated with 100 μM of rat MCH (Sigma-Aldrich)
and imaged after 20 and 45 min of hormone incubation. As a control,
untreated fish were imaged two consecutive times.

hM4Di-2A-eGFP
Plasmid Preparation and DNA Transduction of Frog
Melanophores
The hMD4i cassette was excised by standard PCR
from the vector pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine (Addgene Plasmid
#50455). The cassette was cloned in frame with a 2A-eGFP (obtained
by standard PCR from a donor vector) using Gibson Assembly (NEB, New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, U.S.A.). Xenopus melanophores were freshly seeded 2 days before DNA transduction.
Four μg of purified plasmid were transduced into frog melanophore
cells using electroporation with Ingenio Electroporation Solution
(Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) and Gene Pulser Xcell (Biorad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.) with the following settings: 250
V, 800 μF, 700 Ohms. The cells were left to recover and their
gene expression was assessed via fluorescence at 48 h after the electroporation.
Cells were selected via FACSAria III (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, U.S.A.) 3 days after the electroporation and the results were
analyzed with “Flowing Software”.

Xenotransplantation
of Frog Melanophores and Beads into Zebrafish
Frog melanophore
cells were collected in PBS via centrifugation
and were xenotransplanted—using standard pressure injection—into
the brain of rag2E450 fs mutant fish that were anesthetized in MS222 (PharmaQ, Overhalla,
Norway) treated with a local analgesic. After surgery, the fish were
left to recover for at least 16 h. Successful engraftment of the transplanted
cells was observed under a standard stereomicroscope revealing how
the melanophores spread their processes into the brain tissue. The
fish were then imaged with RSOM and euthanized subsequently using
a high dose of MS222.

Melatonin-Mediated Melanosome Aggregation
Experiment
One day after xenotransplantation of the frog
melanophores, the fish
were imaged with RSOM before and after addition of 100 nM of melatonin
(Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in fish culturing medium (water) to the
dish in which the fish were embedded, such that the whole fish were
bathed. The fish were scanned before and 30 min after the hormone
was delivered, similarly to the MCH experiment.

Optoacoustic
Imaging Procedure
Optoacoustic imaging
was performed by means of epi-illumination raster-scan optoacoustic
mesoscopy (RSOM).5 A scheme of the imaging
system is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The samples were illuminated by a pulsed solid-state laser at a
wavelength of 532 nm (Wedge HB532, Bright Solutions SRL, Pavia, Italy;
actively Q-switched, pulse width: ∼1 ns, max. pulse repetition
rate: 2 kHz, max. energy per pulse: 1 mJ.) The laser beam was expanded
and coupled into an optical fiber bundle with three arms (1808B, Ceram
Optec GmbH, Bonn, Germany; NA: 0.22) to guide the illumination onto
the sample from the same side as the detection was performed (epi-illumination).
The acoustic waves generated in the sample were detected by a spherically
focused ultrasound transducer at a central frequency of ∼100
MHz (SONAXIS, Besancon, France; −12 dB bandwidth (pulse-echo
method): ∼ 20–180 MHz, focal distance: 1.6 mm, active
element diameter: 1.5 mm). By measuring a photoacoustic point source
(receive-only method), a −18 dB high cutoff frequency of ∼225
MHz of the transducer has been determined experimentally. Due to the
short focal distance of the transducer, the front end was conically
shaped to allow the illumination to be brought underneath the transducer
at an angle of approximately 45° (see Supplementary
Figure S1). In order to provide efficient acoustic coupling,
the transducer was immersed in the liquid covering the sample during
the respective measurement (e.g., fish water, PBS, or MCH). The focal
region of the transducer was positioned above the samples or structures
of interest to be imaged, i.e., the photoacoustic signals originated
from the conical far-field of the spherically focused detector. After
amplification with a low-noise amplifier (AU-1291, Miteq Inc., U.S.A.;
gain: 63 dB), the detected photoacoustic signals were recorded by
a high-speed digitizer at a sampling rate of 1GS/s (EON-121-G20, Gage-applied,
Montreal, Canada; vertical resolution: 12 bit). For the light adaptation
experiment, the signals were acquired with a similar device at 0.9
GS/s (ADQ-412–3G, SP Devices, Linköping, Sweden; vertical
resolution: 12 bit). The trigger for the data acquisition was provided
by a photodiode (DET36A, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, U.S.A.) that collected
scattered laser light. Raster-scanning was performed by laterally
moving the transducer together with the illumination over the sample
in a semicontinuous manner by means of two motorized high-precision
piezo stages (M-683.2U4, Physik Instrumente GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe,
Germany). Along the continuous fast axis, the step size between consecutive
measurements was determined by the laser repetition rate and the speed
of the fast axis. The step size was 10 μm for the melatonin
stimulation experiment, yielding an acquisition time of fewer than
4 min for a scanning field of view (FOV) of 6 × 6 mm2. For the other experiments, the step size was reduced to 4 μm
to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in an acquisition
time of ∼10 min for a 6 × 6 mm2 FOV. At each
measurement position, the time-resolved photoacoustic signals were
recorded, bandpass filtered in the 20–180 MHz range to reject
noise and stored for further processing. Parasitic signals originating
from laser light reflections were removed using a spatial FFT filter.

Image Reconstruction
RSOM employs tomographic imaging,
i.e., in contrast to optoacoustic microscopy also out-of-focus signals
within the double-conical sensitivity field of the transducer are
detected. Therefore, image reconstruction has to be employed in RSOM
in order to restore the original 3D optical absorption distribution
of the imaged absorbers. Here, we used 3D filtered backprojection
where the sensitivity field of the detector was modeled as a hyperboloid
with a Gaussian-weighted lateral profile.3 From the 3D reconstruction, images were created using maximum intensity
projections (MIP). For the Xenopus laevis in vitro measurement, the thin cell layer was measured at the focal
plane of the transducer, and no image reconstruction had to be employed.
In this case, the photoacoustic signals were cropped around the focal
time and directly projected along the depth dimension to form MIPs
of the imaged cell layer. Generally, image processing was performed
with ImageJ. The same image processing tools were utilized for the
control and stimulation data and applied homogeneously across the
entire images. The insets were further processed after selection.

Analysis of the Pigmented Area with Brightfield Microscopy and
RSOM
The pigmented areas of imaged cells were analyzed using
the ROI manager tool from the “Fiji” software.43 The subsequent statistical analysis was performed
in “GraphPad Prism 6” (GraphPad Software, CA, U.S.A.).
The normality of the data was assessed calculating a Shapiro–Wilk
normality test, KS normality test, and D’Agostino & Pearson
omnibus test. If data were normal according to at least two of these
methods, a t-test was used; otherwise, nonparametric
tests were employed.

the frequency analysis can be found in the Supporting
