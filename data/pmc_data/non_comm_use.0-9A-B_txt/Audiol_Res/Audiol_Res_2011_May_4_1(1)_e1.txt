==== Body
Increasing evidence indicates that screening and early treatment of hearing disability have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life and extend the functional status of adult population. Hearing disability is indeed one of the most common chronic health conditions in older adults, and has important implications for the quality of life, such as functional decline, depression and social isolation. According to the 2004 report from the World Health Organization, released in 2008, hearing loss is the first among the 20 leading causes of moderate-to-severe disability. The diminished ability to hear and to communicate is frustrating in and of itself, but the strong association of hearing disability with depression and functional decline adds further to the burden on individuals who are hearing impaired.

In most cases, age-related hearing loss in adults takes a long time to develop. It is a progressive process, and does typically produce a very slow habituation to the impairment. These are probably the most underestimated aspects of age-related hearing loss and justify careful investigation on appropriate screening models.

Screening programs can be advocated if evidence is provided to support each of the three commonly accepted criteria: i) the burden of disability must be significant enough to justify the effort of screening, ii) effective intervention strategies and criteria must be available for the detected condition, and iii) accurate, practical and convenient screening tests must exist.

Awareness on these issues rose significantly during the past few years thus stimulating new research and intense discussions on practical models and guidelines to cope with the increasing demand of new hearing care for adults and older adults. Also, the development of technology of hearing aids and of hearing screening methods has played an important role.

The European Commission launched a project to coordinate part of the activities in this area (AHEAD III, 2008-2011, www.ahead.polimi.it) with partners belonging to a large number of European countries. One of the briefs of project AHEAD III was to contribute to the organization of the 2010 International Conference on Adult Hearing Screening (AHS 2010). The Book of Abstracts of all the presentations can be downloaded from here: www.ahs2010.polimi.it

This Special Issue includes a number of selected contributions among the numerous communications presented at this Conference and contains reports on epidemiology and aetiology of hearing, investigations on auditory temporal processing and auditory functionality, effects of ageing on hearing, methods, economic issues and planning strategies for adult hearing screening, new trends in Intervention strategies and development of hearing aids.

We are much grateful to all those who contributed with a manuscript and to those who assisted with the completion of the present publication.
