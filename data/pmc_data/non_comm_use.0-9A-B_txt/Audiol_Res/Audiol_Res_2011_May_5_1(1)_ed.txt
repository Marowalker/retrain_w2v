==== Body
It is our pleasure to announce the first issue of Audiology Research. This new journal was designed to be a place where the readers will quickly and clearly find up-to-date and high-quality information related to the audiology field in a broad sense, ranging from the medical/clinical perspective to the basic and experimental research.

Audiology Research will be not only the on-line repository of a series of scientific papers but also the place where to find other type of information such as guidelines/position statements from national or international bodies, reports/surveys from scientific societies, commentaries on hot-topics in the audiology field. We encourage papers from diverse range of researchers, including academics, clinicians, technicians, and officers from health authorities. We want to give a voice to important information that was not being disseminated because it did not quite fit the style of existing publications. It is our intent to produce a publication with a broad perspective that would be of value to the audiological scientific community interested in Disorders of hearing, Diagnostic testing, Pharmacological treatments for audiological disorders, Rehabilitative devices, Aging and Hearing Disorders, Genetics, Anatomy and Physiology, Psychoacoustics, Speech and Hearing sciences, Vestibular disorders, Neuroscience and Audiology, Psychology in Audiological disorders, Epidemiology, Statistics, Engineering.

For this first issue of Audiology Research we developed a selection of 25 contributions from experts in the field of adult hearing care. It was our purpose to produce as the first volume a publication with a broad perspective, ranging from epidemiology, to advanced studies of auditory functionality, new technologies for hearing screening, and intervention strategies. We hope that this first issue will be of interest to a wide variety of readers.

It is our intent for the future to continue to provide valuable publications where to make profit from the interdisciplinary nature of the audiological field.

Last but not least, many thanks to all those who are giving us their commitment to bring Audiology Research to life, especially the Editorial Board, the panel of reviewers and the Editorial staff.
