Aims
To identify different types of models used in economic evaluations of smoking cessation, analyse the quality of the included models examining their attributes and ascertain their transferability to a new context.

Methods
A systematic review of the literature on the economic evaluation of smoking cessation interventions published between 1996 and April 2015, identified via Medline, EMBASE, National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The checklist‐based quality of the included studies and transferability scores was based on the European Network of Health Economic Evaluation Databases (EURONHEED) criteria. Studies that were not in smoking cessation, not original research, not a model‐based economic evaluation, that did not consider adult population and not from a high‐income country were excluded.

Findings
Among the 64 economic evaluations included in the review, the state‐transition Markov model was the most frequently used method (n = 30/64), with quality adjusted life years (QALY) being the most frequently used outcome measure in a life‐time horizon. A small number of the included studies (13 of 64) were eligible for EURONHEED transferability checklist. The overall transferability scores ranged from 0.50 to 0.97, with an average score of 0.75. The average score per section was 0.69 (range = 0.35–0.92). The relative transferability of the studies could not be established due to a limitation present in the EURONHEED method.

Conclusion
All existing economic evaluations in smoking cessation lack in one or more key study attributes necessary to be fully transferable to a new context.

Introduction
The core strategies in reducing smoking prevalence are to prevent people from starting smoking, to reduce the number of smokers and to decrease the chances of relapse. This can be achieved by implementing population‐based tobacco control policies (e.g. legislations and mass media campaigns) and smoking cessation programmes (e.g. drug or behavioural therapies) targeted at current smokers. However, due to the increasing number of interventions now available, decision‐makers face difficulties in deciding which intervention to implement. Given scarce resources, relative costs and benefits of those interventions are one of the key decision‐making criteria, thus making the importance of economic evaluations rise in recent years 1, 2.

Economic evaluations combine the outcomes of interventions with their costs, in order to determine which intervention provides the best value for money 3. Such evaluations, for example, have shown that treatment with varenicline 4, 5 or behavioural support by mobile phone 6 can be cost‐effective. Model‐based economic evaluations are especially appropriate to extrapolate the benefits beyond clinical trials and when a single primary source of data is not sufficient 7. In addition, a model‐based economic evaluation has the ability to adapt itself to a new context, making the process of executing economic evaluations less time‐consuming and thus less costly 8, 9. Unfortunately, such evaluations often originate in affluent societies. The number of lives that can be saved from the use of such evidence elsewhere (e.g. countries in Central and Eastern Europe) is potentially enormous. Sadly, those countries often have too limited research resources to study cost‐effectiveness of such interventions in their own context, highlighting the importance of transferability assessments 9, 10.

The notion of transferability of evidence from one context to others varies widely in the literature. ‘Transferability’, ‘generalizability’ and ‘external validity’ are the concepts used to assess the ability of a study to be relevant to the decision maker's context to the extent the findings could actually be used 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. However, a distinction also exists between what is feasible/applicable and what is generalizable/transferable. Applicability refers to ‘how can I replicate the intervention in my own decision context?’ (the process question) and generalizability refers to ‘whether the effectiveness will be similar to that in the original context?’ (the outcome question) 12, 13, 15, 16. Therefore, these two underlying questions seem to have defined transferability in the literature.

Transferability assessments to date have focused mainly on the way in which a model is constructed and populated, as modelling provides a well‐defined structure helping us to recognize the limitations and their implications for generalizability of the results 7, 17, 18, 19. There has not been a systematic enquiry in to the transferability of economic evaluations in smoking cessation, although a few systematic reviews in this area exist 20, 21. The review by Kirsch et al. 21, for instance, limits itself to a narrow definition of study population and to a specific type of economic model. In this paper, we therefore set out to: (i) identify different types of models used in economic evaluations of smoking cessation; (ii) analyse the quality of the included models examining their attributes; and (iii) ascertain their transferability to a new context.

Methods
Search strategy and implementation
A systematic search was conducted to identify all relevant models used for economic evaluation in smoking cessation on the following databases: National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Medline and EMBASE. They were searched for publications in English language between 1996 and April 2015. The search strategy was based on related published systematic reviews 20, 22, 23, 24, leading to the final search terms ‘smoking’, ‘nicotine’ and ‘tobacco’ in NHS EED and HTA. Medline and EMBASE required additional terms related to model‐based economic evaluation, which were based on Wilczynski et al. 25 and McKinlay 26 to acquire high sensitivity as well as high specificity 27. Supporting information, Table S1 shows an overview of the search strategies used by databases. All results were exported to EndNote (Thomson Reuters) version X7, where duplications were removed automatically and remaining duplicates checked manually.

Exclusion criteria and screening
Title and abstract screening for the first 50 papers was performed independently by two reviewers (M.H. and M.B.) based on the following exclusion criteria: (1) topic not in smoking cessation (as the focus was on the interventions to reduce tobacco use), (2) no original research (to avoid inclusion of review of evidence or opinion pieces), (3) no model‐based economic evaluation (to avoid inclusion of other designs, e.g. trial‐based evaluations), (4) no adult general population (to focus on adults, rather than children), (5) no high‐income country (to reduce study heterogeneity by including comparable, industrialized countries based on their income levels) and (6) not available in the English language (practicality reasons mainly to address resource constraints). No differences in exclusion/inclusion were observed between both reviewers; only minor discrepancies were recorded in the reason of exclusion. The inter‐rater reliability (IRR) gave a Cohen's kappa of 0.912, meaning almost perfect agreement 28. Remaining discrepancies were discussed, leading to full agreement. Screening of the remaining papers was then completed by one researcher (M.B.). Full text screening was performed independently by two reviewers (M.B. and K.L.C. or M.H.). There were only minor discrepancies between the reviewers, which led to full agreement after discussion. Supporting information, Tables S2 and S3 show an extended list of exclusion criteria for full‐text screening.

Data extraction
Data on the following items were extracted using an Excel template adapted from published studies 20, 29, 30 and included: study attributes (type of evaluation, interventions, comparator and country); model (type, transition or health states, time horizon and perspective); effectiveness (outcome and discount rate, primary measure of effectiveness and utility valuations); costs (perspective, categories, resource, index year and discount rate); uncertainty (type and outcome of sensitivity analysis); and results and major limitations.

As data from some included studies were already extracted by the University of York's Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) (n = 39 of 64), only one researcher (M.B.) extracted data independently on those studies and compared with the CRD extraction. The CRD database contains clear and structured summaries of the economic analyses by experts, and therefore it was deemed sufficient to compare the results of data extraction to these summaries. For the remaining studies that were not included in the CRD database, the data were extracted independently by two reviewers (M.B. and one of the following: M.H., K.L.C., R.D.K. and P.K). Any disagreement between the reviewers was resolved by consensus with a third reviewer.

Quality appraisal
In order to appraise the quality, 10% of the included studies were first assessed independently by M.B. and M.H., using a quality checklist and corresponding classification from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Methodology Guide with the aim to filter out quality‐poor studies 31. The quality checklist was based on three major criteria: (1) the study was conducted from a relevant perspective (i.e. at least payer or health‐care perspective; (2) the study was a cost–utility or cost–benefit analysis with cost/quality adjusted life years (QALY) or benefit–cost ratio reported; and (3) limitations, either stated in the original study or identified by the reviewers during data extraction stage. Once the overall assessment using these criteria was completed, the studies were assigned to one of the following three classifications: (i) a study with minor limitations (ML); (ii) a study with potentially serious limitations (PSL); or (iii) a study with very serious limitations (VSL). As full agreement on quality classification was reached in the 10% of the included studies, M.B. then completed the quality appraisal of the remaining studies.

Transferability assessment
The studies appraised as the one with minor limitations (ML) were considered to be of sufficient quality to be included for transferability assessment applying the EURONHEED checklist 9. Two independent researchers (M.B. and one of the following: M.H., K.L.C., R.D.K. and P.K.) applied the checklist. The EURONHEED checklist was developed originally by Boulenger et al. 9 and described and updated further with guidelines by Nixon et al. 32. It consists of 42 questions, 26 of which relate to overall methodological quality and internal validity, and 16 questions relate to transferability. An overview of all questions is provided in Supporting information, Table S4. Every question can be answered by ‘yes/partially/no or not applicable (NA)’, assigning a score of 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively. While each item in the checklist is treated equally (but implicitly giving more weight to 16 of the 42 items), the assigned score to each question thus additionally provides another weight to reflect the extent to which each item was reported in the study being assessed 32. The combination of the questions generates an overall summary score 9, 10. We calculated two summary scores: the total summary score including all 42 items and the transferability score including the 16 items. The summary scores were calculated using the following formula; 
1n−x∑iSi×100
, in which n is the number of questions, x is the number of questions for which the response was NA and S is the score of each question 9. The summary scores reflect how thoroughly key methodological items are reported as the quality of reporting is paramount for generalizability/transferability 32. In addition to this, we calculated the scored percentage of the total score possible per section. This showed us what sections within model‐based economic evaluations were of sufficient quality and which needed further improvement. For example, a score of 0.75 means that 75% of this section is of sufficient quality.

Results
Search outcomes
The systematic literature search yielded 1925 references. After removing duplicates, 1500 studies were included for title and abstract screening which led to a total of 101 studies selected for full text screening. On applying the exclusion criteria, 64 studies were judged to be eligible for data extraction. Thirteen of the 64 studies were included for transferability assessment. An overview of the process is provided in Fig. 1.

The populations in the analyses were described mainly as the general adult population of smokers. In three studies the populations were described further as smoking 20 cigarettes per day or more 33, 34, 35, making or considering a single or first quit attempt 36, 37, 38, 39 or had recently tried to quit smoking 40, 41. In five studies the population was described only as a dynamic and/or hypothetical cohort 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 and in nine studies the population was not reported at all 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55.

A significant part of the intervention was smoking cessation programmes, either pharmacotherapy 4, 5, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, behavioural therapy 6, 42, 47, 66, 67, 68, 69 or a combination of these 33, 34, 35, 43, 45, 46, 49, 52, 54, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75. Several studies evaluated wider tobacco control interventions 39, 44, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, whereas five studies included both smoking cessation programmes and tobacco control interventions 89, 90, 91, 92, 93.

In a number of studies, the authors selected ‘no intervention’ or ‘current situation’ as comparator. All other studies described the comparators in more detail (Table 1).

The main measure of outcome used is the QALY. In total, 23 of 64 studies reported QALY as their main outcome 5, 35, 38, 40, 41, 47, 48, 49, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 65, 69, 70, 76, 78, 81, 86, 88, 94, followed by life years (LY) gained (n = nine of 64) 33, 43, 46, 66, 67, 68, 73, 74, 89 or a combination of these (n = 12 of 64) 4, 6, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 57, 77, 80, 83. Five of 64 studies reported disability adjusted life years (DALY) as their main outcome 60, 82, 90, 91, 92, and only four of 64 (incremental) net benefit 52, 53, 55, 71. There were two of 64 studies reporting only the intermediate outcomes of the intervention 85, 93 (Table 1).

Overview of economic models
Table 2 shows the main model attributes used in the included studies. Thirty of 64 studies used a Markov model, 12 of which used a specific type called the benefits of smoking cessation on outcomes (BENESCO) model 4, 5, 36, 37, 48, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 65. Decision‐tree models 41, 43, 52, 55, 63, 71, 75, 83, 93, discrete‐event simulations (DES) 45, 54, the chronic disease model (RIVM‐CDM) 44, 81, 88, the tobacco policy model (TPM) 76, 77, the quit benefits model (QBM) 80, the World Health Organization (WHO) model 90, the global health outcomes model (GHO model) 70 and the abstinent‐contingent treatment model (ABT model) 73 were also used. Twelve of 64 studies did not report explicitly the model used, reporting only decision analysis modelling or simulation modelling 39, 50, 51, 66, 69, 72, 74, 78, 86 or limiting the description to only dynamic or static modelling 42, 82, 92.

a This refers to the states considered in the model and may include: (1) never smoker, current smoker, former smoker; (2) never smoker, current smoker, ex‐smoker, death; (3) current smoker, former smoker, death; (4) current smoker, recent quitter, long‐term quitter; (5) no morbidity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke first event, CHD or stroke subsequent event, death from CHD/stroke, death from COPD/lung cancer, death (all cause); (6) no current morbidity, asthma exacerbation, CHD or stroke: post first event, COPD or lung cancer, CHD or stroke: post subsequent event, death (CHD or stroke), death (COPD or lung cancer), death (all cause).

b Uncertainty analysis: USA = univariate sensitivity analysis; MSA = multivariate sensitivity analysis; ECA = extreme case analysis; PSA = probabilistic sensitivity analysis; DSA = deterministic sensitivity analysis; NRT = nicotine replacement therapy; NYTCP = New York Tobacco Control Program; SES = socio‐economic status; MI = minor limitations; SC = ; NR = not reported; QALY = quality adjusted life years.

Several (18 of 30) studies based on Markov models provided sufficient information on transition or health states used in the model. The most frequently used transition states were current smoker, former smoker or death, while health states included asthma exacerbation, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. In decision‐tree models (n = nine of 64) the most reported transition states were quit attempt or no quit attempt, often combined with success to quit or failure to quit.

The majority of the Markov models used a life‐time horizon (n = 22 of 30) while decision‐tree models considered a time between 1 and 50 years. Most of the studies based on other models lacked sufficient information, or reported a time‐horizon of 50 years. Most evaluations used a health‐care and/or payer perspective (n = 50 of 64). Twelve of 64 used a societal perspective. The reported primary measure of effectiveness in all models was quit rate or its variants (e.g. continuous abstinence rates).

The majority of the studies (n = 55 of 64) performed sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainties in their estimates. Markov model‐based studies performed mainly both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, decision‐tree models used univariate sensitivity analyses often in combination with multivariate sensitivity analyses (n = five of nine), and the other models (n = 25 of 64) conducted univariate sensitivity analyses (n = 13 of 25).

Quality assessment and transferability
Of the 64 included studies assessed for quality, 15 were excluded based on the first criteria (no health‐care perspective), 12 based on the second (no cost benefit or cost–utility analysis) and 24 on the final criteria (having major limitations). As shown in Table 3, 13 of 64 studies were then classified as having minor limitations, 35 as having potentially serious limitations and 16 as having very serious limitations.

Discussion
Key findings
Markov‐based state transition models with QALY as the outcome measure were the most frequently used technique in evaluating the cost‐effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. However, the majority of the studies were reported poorly, making it hard to assess their transferability using the existing checklist‐based method. Where such assessment was possible, studies showed a wide variation in transferability scores, driven mainly by the method of selecting populations, assessing effectiveness and outcomes and estimating variability and generalizability of their own findings.

Relative transferability
The EURONHEED method assumes that without a quality score it would be impossible to transfer a study to another setting 9, 32, 95. Therefore, the explicit assessment using this method resulted in some studies being more favourable candidates than others. However, on average, all studies lacked in some attributes for full transferability. One of the main differences between a high score and a low score is how differently the studies scored on the questions on costs. For example, Annemans et al. (2009), with a score of 0.50, addressed most of the cost questions only partially, whereas Hoogendoorn et al. (2008), with a score of 0.97, did so fully. Therefore, costs are important determinants of the transferability assessment 9. Our review also highlighted other determinants; namely, selection of study population, intervention and comparator descriptions, effectiveness and benefit measures and variability/generalizability analyses—all scoring below the overall average score. Without a threshold, it was not possible to rank the assessed studies on their relative transferability, and this will be explored further below.

Comparison to current literature
Several systematic reviews are available on the cost‐effectiveness of smoking cessation 22, 23, 24, but only one systematic review looking at model‐based economic evaluations 20. Most of the studies included in their review used the Markov model with long‐term time horizons, included comparable health states and reported the similar measures of effectiveness and outcomes as ours, and common weaknesses included poor reporting of the modelling details. However, a key difference from our review is that they did not build on their findings to evaluate the extent to which such models could be transferable from the original context to others, for wider benefits 9, 10, 17. In areas outside smoking cessation, Korber has evaluated physical activity interventions for their transferability 96. Consistent with our findings, she also found that a very few included studies explored variability from place to place and discussed caveats regarding the generalizability of results, ‘leading to a wide variation in the transferability of the study results ranging from “low” to “very high” with everything in between’ 96. Another study 97 found that population and methodological characteristics were poorly reported—a finding that echoes our own results on the weaknesses of the models.

Implications of this review
Despite the availability of several guidelines on how to conduct and report adequately on economic evaluations 29, 31, there is still a considerable variation in the quality of published economic evaluations in smoking cessation. Arguably, this may limit the use of such evidence in other contexts. Some authors argue that the factors affecting the perception of applicability (the process question) and transferability (the outcome question) together might be broader than the factors associated with external validity 13. Notwithstanding this difference, the EURONHEED method relies heavily upon the quality of reporting to ascertain transferability 32. Therefore, such scores can be limited in use by the end‐users for two reasons. First, a poorly constructed model could have been reported well scoring high on the transferability scale and vice versa. Secondly, without a threshold score, it is hard to judge a study or to rank and compare across the studies. Nixon et al. 32 argue that the EURONHEED score should, rather, be used as a general guide in making decisions, but also note that the explicit assessment of transferability using this method will introduce an educational element, helping researchers to improve the design, conduct and reporting of future studies.

This review highlights the educational element noted above. Transparency in the model building and subsequent analysis and results, which can be captured by the quality of reporting, can enhance our understanding of the underlying process and outcome questions. However, a robust method would require more analyses based on the model outputs (as opposed to the checklists), backed up by the perceptions of actual stakeholders (including decision makers) as to what is relevant, adaptable, valid and transferable to them 13, 16. The European study on Quantifying Utility of Investment in Protection from Tobacco (EQUIPT) 98 provides some promise to that end by encompassing both model‐based analyses (e.g. on the parameter importance and variability) and the analysis of the stakeholder views (e.g. on the importance of interventions and intention to use economic evidence in policymaking) 99, 100, in addition to the systematic reviews based on the published models such as this. Although the final results of the EQUIPT study are yet to be published, this comprehensive framework appears to provide the end‐users with an understanding of a key transferability attribute—what changes in the economic model would make it transferable to their own settings and why 15.

This review also reiterates the already identified challenge in terms of the way in which economic evaluations in broader public health are designed, conducted and reported 101. The finding that only one‐fifth of the included study met quality classification for transferability implies that policymakers, researchers and journal editors need to work together in enhancing the quality of new economic evaluations and making it more transferable. The guidelines used by economic evaluation community and journals such as this are helpful to that end 102. However, such guidelines should also emphasize the need for the authors to assess and report transferability of their models to the new contexts. This would ensure that future studies could consider adding model‐based analysis of transferability on to the checklist‐based evaluation, backed up by, where possible, analysis of the views of stakeholders.

Limitations
A major limitation of this review has been the limitation embedded in the existing method of transferability assessment 9, 32. Future research may overcome this limitation by adopting a comprehensive assessment as discussed above. In addition, limiting the search to English language only might have excluded some studies. However, we identified more model‐based economic evaluations than a previous similar review 22. The use of three quality criteria 31 for inclusion of studies in the transferability assessment could potentially have introduced some bias, as it was based on the overall assessment, as opposed to some standard checklists such as those by Drummond 103 or Philips 104. However, the variety of items included in our data extraction form as outlined in the best practice guidelines 102 were very similar to the Drummond or Philips checklists, implying the possibility of such bias to be minimal. Finally, exclusion of low‐/middle‐income countries to reduce study heterogeneity could have limited this review in its primary focus (i.e. evidence transferability to less‐affluent countries).

Conclusion
Existing economic evaluations in smoking cessation vary in quality, resulting mainly from the way in which they selected their populations, measured costs and effects and assessed the variability and generalizability of their own findings. All studies lacked one or more key study attributes for full transferability. A robust design, coupled with comprehensive reporting of key study attributes, could make economic evaluations transferable to a new context.
