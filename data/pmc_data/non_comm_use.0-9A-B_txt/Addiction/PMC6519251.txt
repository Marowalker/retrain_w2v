Background and aims
There is limited evidence on what shapes amphetamine‐type stimulant (ATS) use trajectories. This systematic narrative review and qualitative synthesis aimed to identify individual, social and environmental influences shaping key phases in the ATS use trajectory: initiation, continuation, increase/relapse and decrease/abstinence.

Methods
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PROQUEST (social science premium collection) were searched from 2000 to 2018. Studies of any qualitative design were eligible for inclusion. Extracted data were analysed according to four key phases within drug pathways, and then cross‐analysed for individual, social and environmental influences.

Results
Forty‐four papers based on 39 unique studies were included, reporting the views of 1879 ATS users. Participants were aged 14–58 years, from varied socio‐economic and demographic groups, and located in North America, Europe, Australasia and South East Asia. Reasons for initiation included: to boost performance at work and in sexual relationships, promote a sense of social ‘belonging’ and help manage stress. Similar reasons motivated continued use, combined with the challenge of managing withdrawal effects in long‐term users. Increased tolerance and/or experiencing a critical life event contributed to an increase in use. Reasons for decrease focused on: increased awareness of the negative health impacts of long‐term use, disconnecting from social networks or relationships and financial instability.

Conclusions
Amphetamine‐type stimulant users are a highly diverse population, and their drug use careers are shaped by a complex dynamic of individual, social and environmental factors. Tailored, joined‐up interventions are needed to address users’ overlapping economic, health and social care needs in order to support long‐term abstinence.

Introduction
Amphetamine‐type stimulants (ATS), such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), are the second most commonly used class of illicit drugs globally 1. A decline in levels of use reported at the start of this decade in some regions of the world has been reversed in recent years, with a pronounced increase in East and South East Asia 2. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime report that world‐wide quantities of ATS seized doubled between 2010 and 2015, with methamphetamine accounting for 61–80% 2. Alongside more traditional ATS, there has also been a rise in the number of stimulant‐type novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in global drug markets, including synthetic cathinones such as benzylpiperazine (BZP) and mephedrone 3. Increasing rates of methylphenidate (MPH) abuse have also been reported, often by students seeking to enhance their cognitive performance 4, 5, 6.

Methamphetamine use at dependent levels is associated with multiple comorbidities, including HIV infection, hepatitis, cardiac effects, cognitive dysfunction and prominent psychiatric consequences, such as psychosis 7, 8. Although MDMA is often viewed as a recreational drug, prolonged use is associated with neurological dysfunction and depression 9. Additional societal costs identified with ATS abuse include premature death, crime, lost productivity, environmental damage, disruption of family life and infectious disease 7, 10, 11. However, few treatment options exist 12. There is currently no effective pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine‐ or amphetamine‐type stimulant dependency 13. While there is some evidence of efficacy for psychosocial therapies 14, 15, 16, their real‐world impact has been limited by poor retention rates and treatment adherence among ATS users 17, with high rates of relapse 18. Given the adverse and often irreversible impacts of repeated ATS use, with early age of onset recognized as one of the best predictors of future substance abuse and dependence 12, prevention is also key. However, again, few effective preventative intervention options exist 19, 20.

Complex and inter‐related factors contribute to both an individual's drug use, and their capacity to engage with, and benefit from, preventive advice and/or treatment 21, 22. In contrast to epidemiological methods or effectiveness studies, qualitative research allows us to explore the attitudes and experiences that shape substance users’ behaviour at key moments of change (phases), while recognizing that these practices are embedded within a specific socio‐cultural space and time 23, 24. Such knowledge is critical to the development of more effective prevention and treatment for problem ATS use 25, not least as there is evidence that interventions are more likely to be effective when individuals feel positive about and satisfied with the support that they receive 26. This review aimed to synthesize qualitative data to understand which individual, social and environmental influences shape critical phases in ATS users’ drug careers 27, 28, 29.

The protocol was registered and published in PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, Ref: CRD42016050700).

Methods
Search strategy
We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and PROQUEST (social science premium collection) for peer‐reviewed qualitative studies (including the qualitative elements of mixed methods research) conducted in any setting which explored the views of ATS users aged 13+ on which factors have shaped their drug use careers. Due to the rapidly changing ATS drug scene 2, we focused on literature published from 1 January 2000 to 13 March 2018 (see Table 1 for detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria). The search strategy was split into five core concepts in accordance with the SPIDER tool (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation and Research type) (see Table 2) 30. Terms were coupled with relevant MeSH/thesaurus terms and truncated as appropriate, with variant spellings used. In acknowledgement of the difficulty of identifying relevant qualitative research 31, we also hand‐searched selected journals, reviewed relevant websites and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Search results were downloaded to a bibliographic software program (EndNote X7) and de‐duplicated. Titles and abstracts were screened independently and full texts then similarly reviewed to identify eligible studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or in consultation with another team member. A structured data abstraction form was used to capture: bibliographic details; design and methodology; aim and objectives; and summary findings.

Quality assessment
Included literature were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Research Checklist 32, which evaluates studies on the basis of: (1) clarity of research aims; (2) appropriateness of qualitative methodology; (3) appropriateness of research design; (4) appropriateness of the recruitment strategy; (5) data collection method; (6) consideration of researcher–participant relationship: (7) consideration of ethical issues, (8) rigour of data analysis, (9) clarity of findings and (10) overall value, relevance and impact of the research. Yes/no responses to the first nine questions were used to inform a grading system: 0–4 positive responses elicited a low‐quality rating; 5–7 a moderate‐quality rating; and 8–9 a high‐quality rating. Studies were not excluded on the basis of quality, as poor reporting is not necessarily suggestive of poorly conducted research 33, but were retained on the basis of whether they contributed valuable or novel data to the review.

Data synthesis
Data synthesis was based on Thomas and Harden's thematic method 34. Content was downloaded into qualitative data management software (Nvivo version 10), and line‐by‐line coding of the meaning and content of each study was conducted independently by two reviewers. Data reported in multiple papers but relating to the same individual study were coded separately to maximize thematic yield. Next, these codes were compared and contrasted by the review team, and a hierarchy of descriptive themes and subthemes was identified. Finally, we returned to the original review question, cross‐examining these initial descriptive themes for individual (such as personality traits, beliefs, mental health and resilience), social (such as friends, family and relationships, education and employment) and environmental (such as policy, legislation, physical place and space) factors relating to the critical phases of interest: initiation, continuation, increase/relapse and decrease/abstinence. This approach avoided forcing the evidence into pre‐determined categories, and encouraged a reflective and iterative approach to data synthesis.

Results
Thirty‐nine individual studies were included, reported in 44 papers, and covering the views of 1879 ATS users 22, 24, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76 (see Fig. 1, Table 3).

Study characteristics
Participants were aged between 14 and 58 years. Six studies (eight papers) included only females 24, 35, 42, 43, 53, 56, 73, 74 and eight only males 39, 44, 45, 48, 59, 64, 65, 72, five of which focused on men who have sex with men (MSM) 39, 48, 59, 65, 72. Twenty‐five included both genders (28 papers) 22, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 75, 76. Methodologies employed included in‐depth interviews 22, 35, 37, 38, 46, 47, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, ethnographies 40, 45, 49, 52, 63, 74, focus groups 45, 59, 60, 72 and documentary analysis 76. Twenty‐three studies (27 papers) originated in North America 22, 24, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49, 50, 54, 57, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, five in Europe (six papers) 39, 53, 55, 58, 61, 62, 69, 70, four in Australia 46, 48, 52, 67 and six in South East Asia 45, 51, 56, 59, 68, 72. All participants were polysubstance users. Three studies (four papers) focused specifically on NPS use 39, 61, 62, 75. Six studies (eight papers) examined abuse of prescription medication for conditions such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) 24, 38, 42, 43, 44, 52, 55, 57. Of the 39 studies quality assessed: two were rated as low‐ 40, 56 due to lack of information about recruitment, ethical considerations and/or findings; 27 moderate‐ (32 papers) 24, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 75, 76; and 10 high‐quality 22, 43, 51, 55, 64, 68, 69, 72, 73, 74.

Initiation
Individual factors
Fifteen studies (16 papers) identified personal characteristics such as curiosity and propensity for experimentation as influencing the initiation of ATS use 24, 40, 41, 46, 47, 50, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 65, 68, 69, 70, 75. Van Hout & Brennan examined mephedrone use in Ireland before the introduction of legislation banning the sale of all psychoactive drugs 69. They highlighted the potential for individuals open to experimentation and impulsivity to start using ATS, particularly in recreational settings. Sherman et al. examined ATS use in rural northern Thailand 68, and also found that curiosity about the effects of ATS spurred on usage, often supported by a hedonistic attitude towards perceived risks. Four studies identified enhancement of sex as a factor in ATS initiation 39, 47, 56, 65, predominantly among MSM communities 39, 47, 65


Ten (12 papers) studies identified self‐management of mental health and trauma as a factor motivating initiation of ATS, mostly in methamphetamine users 22, 24, 40, 42, 49, 50, 53, 60, 63, 68, 71, 74. Early traumatic experiences were found to prompt initiation of ATS use among female inmates in a North American prison 42. Methamphetamine‐addicted mothers reported taking ATS to manage low mood and loneliness, and to boost energy 53. A further study of methamphetamine use by street‐entrenched young adults in Vancouver found that ATS initiation was linked to self‐management of depression, anxiety, undiagnosed attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia 49.

Social factors
Family, friendships and intimate relationships with other ATS users was a common social factor contributing to initiation, mentioned by 23 studies (24 papers) 22, 24, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 74. Initiation of ATS use by dangerous sport enthusiasts helped to cement friendships and facilitate identity formation as a risk taker 58. Social proximity to drug dealers was also highlighted as encouraging ATS initiation: Von Mayrhauser et al. report that a quarter of their participants were introduced to ATS by dealers 71. However, in Eiserman et al.'s study of ecstasy use among young adults in an urban setting, family and friends were more influential 47.

Using ATS, and in particular methamphetamine, to enhance work‐place performance was a further common theme, reported in eight studies 22, 37, 38, 40, 56, 64, 68, 71. Participants in Ojeda et al.'s study of Mexican men being deported from the United States used ATS to help them manage exhaustion when working long hours 64. A similar message emerged in research from Boeri et al. examining the trajectories of current and ex‐methamphetamine users in a North American suburb 22. Participants described being encouraged to use ATS by co‐workers to increase energy levels. In addition to enhancing performance, Sherman et al.'s study in Thailand linked ATS initiation to hunger reduction at work 68.

Environmental factors
Thirteen studies found that frequent exposure to ATS within certain settings triggered use initiation 22, 24, 37, 40, 41, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68, particularly house parties and nightclubs 40, 58, 62, 63, 64. As Bahora et al.'s examination of recreational ecstasy use in North America underlines, when ATS are accessible, available and normalized in sociable spaces, likelihood of initiation has been found to increase 36, a finding echoed in a study of stimulant type NPS in Ireland prior to legislative control 61.

Continuation
Individual factors
Sexual enhancement was a key reason for continued methamphetamine use. This relates to boosting sexual pleasure in conventional intimate relationships 71, as well as functional sexual performance and offsetting of associated low mood in both MSM and female sex workers 56, 72. Indeed, coping with ongoing mental health needs was a common theme identified elsewhere 29, 42, 43, 46, 47, 49, 50, 57, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, particularly among methamphetamine users. For example, Fast et al.'s study of street‐entrenched young people in Canada reported that many users were self‐medicating to manage depression and the stress of living in severely deprived circumstances 49.

Eight studies focused on the link between sustained ATS use and a perception of being in control 22, 36, 41, 49, 57, 58, 59, 67. Bahora et al. found that long‐term ecstasy users did not identify any adverse impacts on their day‐to‐day life and believed that ATS were not addictive 36. Lasco et al. explored ATS use among disadvantaged men in the Philippines and also found that participants described their own use as managed and acceptable, drawing a clear distinction between being an ‘addict’ and a ‘user’ 59.

Social factors
Nine studies highlighted the perceived positive impact of continued ATS use on friendships and relationships 36, 38, 42, 47, 49, 69, 74, 75, including Farrugia's exploration of how MDMA was used to facilitate a sense of intimacy between young male users 48. Evidence also emerged of a socially mediated level of ATS use being established, with higher dosages than ‘acceptable’ within friendship groups being stigmatized 59, 60, 61. Linked to the work performance issue highlighted previously, Bungay et al. 41 examined ATS dependency among young adults in urban Canada and found that motivations to continue use related to improved focus, particularly when committing acquisitive crime 41.

Environmental factors
Two studies found that street‐entrenched and homeless participants reported continued ATS use because of their exclusion from more mainstream opportunity structures such as stable housing, education and employment 50, 60. Normalized ATS use in certain spaces and places such as US college campuses 60, clubs and guest houses 56 also contributed to continued consumption. Ambiguity around the legal status of stimulant‐type NPS also led to their sustained use, fuelled by a perception of the reliable effects they produced 70.

Increase/relapse
Individual factors
A desire for heightened effects was identified as contributing to an increase in ATS use by both Boeri et al. 22 and Eiserman et al. 47. Loss of control of dosage and frequency of methamphetamine‐taking was cited by Haight et al. as linked to increased use 53. O'Brien et al. highlight how such an increase often became part of a cycle of addiction that users found difficult to extricate themselves from, particularly when their mental health and familial relationships had deteriorated 63. Similarly, Boeri et al. 22 reported that several critical events such unemployment, loss of a relationship and lack of social support, could coalesce, prompting an increase in methamphetamine use, and subsequently a loss of control over dosage and frequency 22.

Duff & Moore (2015) found that participants were reluctant to stop ATS use altogether because of persisting mental health problems, underpinned by a belief that methamphetamine helped stabilize mood or feelings 46. In Boeri et al.'s US‐based study, relapse after a period of abstinence was posited as a ‘reward’ for good behaviour 22. Bungay et al. also report that temporary desistance from ATS for health and/or aesthetic reasons was framed as a short period of ‘detoxification’ by some users, with consumption resumed once health or desired weight was restored 41.

Social factors
Increased ATS use was also linked to social pressures. For example, Fast et al. found that some street‐entrenched young adults wanted to avoid being stigmatized as a casual, inexperienced user (‘weekend warrior’) and so increased their usage to boost their social status 50. They also found that people who had recently become homeless reported rapid, intense ATS use as a way of socially integrating with established networks. Loza et al. found that ATS escalation became a practice which spread among social networks of women 73.

Work‐ and education‐related factors also contributed to increased ATS use. Von Mayrhauser et al. found that work instability could motivate an escalation in use 71; a point echoed in studies from Boeri et al. 22 and German et al. 51, alongside the impact of longer working hours. Desantis et al.'s 44 research into the impact of ATS on American students found that as they reached their final years, existing users would be more likely to escalate their ATS use as a means of coping with increased stress around exams and workload 44 (a point reiterated by Kerley et al. 57). Three studies highlighted reconnecting to a former drug‐using network as contributing to relapse 22, 38, 51.

Environmental factors
Environmental and ecological stressors, such as unstable housing, food and finances, were highlighted by O'Brien et al. as causing increased ATS use 63. Fast et al. focused on the adverse impact of welfare withdrawal on deprivation and disadvantage which, in turn, led to escalating ATS use 49. Bungay et al. found that a return to homelessness would lead to additional stressors, meaning that ex‐users would frequently relapse to cope with their situation 41.

Desistance/abstinence
Individual factors
A concern about physical and mental health was reported as a factor stimulating desistence in fourteen studies 30, 40, 41, 47, 50, 51, 54, 55, 60, 61, 64, 66. Fast et al. found that the negative impact of heavy ATS use on cognitive abilities, as well as increased paranoia and deterioration of physical appearance, motivated participants to seek treatment 49. Personal qualities such as willpower and self‐awareness were cited as further factors supporting desistance in nine other studies 22, 41, 45, 47, 49, 51, 54, 56, 76, as well as having experienced negative effects from using poor quality ATS 65.

Social factors
Families and relationships could support or prompt desistence in various ways. For example, Boeri et al. found that the imminent threat of relationship breakdown prompted ATS users to cease consumption 22. Proximity to an ATS‐related death also emerged as a strong deterrent in a study by Brown et al. 40. More positively, both Green et al. and German et al. found that the intervention of non‐using friends played an important part in helping ATS users to abstain and in some cases seek treatment 51, 52.

Changing or extricating themselves from particular social networks also appeared to support longer‐term ATS abstention 38, 39, 63, 66. This also applied to the workplace, as Lasco et al.'s study of young, disadvantaged male ATS users in the Philippines found: some participants were able to decrease or abstain from ATS usage as a result of gaining licit employment, which provided routine and respectability 59. Similarly, Sexton et al. also highlight the positive impact of licit employment on reduced ATS use 66.

Environmental factors
A change in the legal status of ATS, particularly NPS, led to desistence in a number of individuals in order to avoid incurring a criminal sanction 60. Haight et al. also report that imprisonment could have a positive impact on some users’ capacity to desist from ATS use 53. However, it was unclear whether this pattern was maintained outside of the prison environment.

Discussion
This qualitative systematic review identified critical turning points on the ATS use trajectory 78. We found a particularly rich literature describing accounts of initiation, but less evidence on increasing or decreasing ATS use. Throughout all turning points, family, friends and social networks played a central role, facilitating users’ initial access, as well as helping to normalize ATS consumption over time. We also found that common individual, social and ecological stressors contributed to changes in the trajectory of ATS use 79. Experiencing mental health problems, relationship breakdown and social and economic exclusion were strong themes at most time‐points, with a number of users experiencing such issues contemporaneously.

The relationship between mental health and ATS use is complex. Experiencing stress, anxiety and/or depression emerged as clear risk factors for ATS initiation, especially methamphetamine, as well as making it more difficult for users to stop or reduce their consumption, an issue highlighted in previous research 77, 80. Epidemiological evidence also confirms that psychostimulants are more likely to induce psychosis than other illicit substances 81, with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation commonly co‐occurring among methamphetamine users 82. However, it is also important to stress that the majority of participants in the included studies were polysubstance users, often consuming a variety of ATS alongside other substances such as opioids and alcohol. Whether cause or effect, the consequences for people experiencing comorbid ATS use and mental health conditions are profound, adversely affecting responses to treatment and its outcomes 83, 84, 85.

ATS users are a highly diverse population, with study participants encompassing students in higher education, women carers and those in full‐time work, as well as highly marginalized groups such as sex workers, the unemployed and homeless people 83. The available data limited our ability to identify trends within specific ATS user groups. However, methamphetamine use was common among the most socially excluded communities 22, 38, 41, 49, 50. While 59% of studies were from the United States (including all those examining misuse of prescription stimulants), ATS use was global, and some commonalities emerged. For example, boredom in rural areas was seen as a factor contributing to ATS initiation in both young men living in both South East Asia 45, 51, 59, 68, 72 and North America 40. However, there were also some notable differences. Accounts of ATS initiation in South East Asia focused on functional methamphetamine use, to cope with the demands of high‐risk, often illicit employment, particularly sex work 56, 59, 72. In contrast, all the studies that explored recreational ATS use, mostly ecstasy and NPS within the club scene, were based in North America 36 Europe 58, 62, 69 or Australia 52.

To our knowledge, this is the first review of international qualitative literature on ATS use trajectories. As such, it responds to an identified gap in the empirical evidence base on what shapes the course of ATS use over time 86. A strength of our review is the diverse and comprehensive nature of the included studies, covering a variety of geographic, social and economic contexts, different drug use practices and a range of user populations. However, our findings are limited by the quality of the available literature, with the majority of included papers deemed of moderate quality. We chose to retain two papers classed as of low quality in our synthesis, as despite the lack of detail on recruitment, ethics and researcher‐reflexivity, the studies provided valuable data on particularly marginalized ATS user populations in the case of Ho's study of female sex workers 56, or employed a novel conceptual framework to explore ATS use, as in Brown's exploration of masculinity in American methamphetamine users 40. Moreover, thematic synthesis is deemed appropriate when such variability exists in the richness and ‘thickness’ of data 87.

Few papers focused on stimulant‐based NPS, probably reflecting their relative recency, as well as the challenge of capturing this rapidly shifting area of substance use 88, 89, 90. Further, we found little qualitative evidence exploring users’ perspectives on which factors enabling decreased ATS use or longer‐term abstinence, although previous systematic reviews have considered the clinical effectiveness of potential interventions for ATS dependency 12, 19, 20. Data on environmental shaping of ATS use at potential change points was also scarce. However, users in the included studies often found it challenging to isolate precise points at which levels of use increased or decreased, which could in turn make it difficult to identify external or distal factors contributing to these changes in their drug use pathway.

Several implications for policy and practice emerge from this review. By identifying which factors contribute to specific transitions in an individual's ATS use trajectory, our findings highlight windows of opportunity for intervention, as well as providing contextual information shaping the change points. Such evidence could contribute to more effective targeting of harm reduction and treatment efforts. Based on previous research, we would suggest that there is particular demand for swift and responsive services for adolescent users, where progression from recreational to dependent levels of consumption can occur within a short time‐frame 91. Further, as others have found, high‐risk sexual behaviour appears common among ATS users 92, meaning that sex risk reduction measures, such as condom provision and voluntary HIV counselling/testing, are also needed 93, 94.

Next, the heterogeneous nature of ATS users suggests the need for treatments and interventions that are tailored to specific subgroups. For example, there are gender differences in the epidemiology, patterns and consequences of substance use, as well as treatment outcomes 95. We would therefore suggest that future policy builds on positive evidence for the incorporation of gender‐specific elements into treatment programmes 95 and the effectiveness of integrated programmes for women with children 96. Similarly, given that mental health was identified as a common factor contributing to the initiation and escalation of ATS consumption, there is a need to address the mental health needs of users in order to improve treatment outcomes 97.

Lastly, while certain subgroups need tailored intervention packages, our findings also highlight the need for joined‐up care from service providers to address users’ overlapping health, welfare and social care needs 19, 98, 99. There is substantial evidence that drug‐dependent individuals are likely to have frequent and often sustained interactions with criminal justice, social service and both primary and secondary health‐care systems 100, 101, 102, yet policy responses are too often fragmented and uncoordinated 103, 104. Stopping ATS use was reported as particularly challenging, and often required users to extract themselves from former social networks to decrease or cease consumption. We would suggest that therapeutic interventions that help users to accumulate increased social capital, including access to broader social networks, are more likely to support their longer‐term transition into abstinence 105.

Conclusions
The findings from this review underline the heterogeneous nature of ATS users, and the complicated dynamic of individual, social and environmental factors that shape different consumption trajectories. Alongside developing interventions better tailored to the multiple, complex needs of specific user subgroups, future research should explore which factors support reduced consumption or abstinence over the longer term.
