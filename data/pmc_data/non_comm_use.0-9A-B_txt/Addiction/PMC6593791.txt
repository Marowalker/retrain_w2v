Aim
To collate prevalence estimates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) among special subpopulations (defined by service use).

Design
Systematic literature review and meta‐analysis of original, quantitative studies published between 1 November 1973 and 1 December 2018. The PRISMAGATHER were adhered to. The review protocol [includes FASD prevalence in (a) general and (b) special populations] is available on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016033837). Prevalence estimates were collated for all included studies with country‐, disorder‐ [FASD and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)] and population‐specific random‐effects meta‐analyses conducted.

Setting and Participants
A number of service‐defined subpopulations globally (see Findings).

Measurements
The main outcome was the prevalence of FASD among special subpopulations. The critical appraisal of each study was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool.

Findings
We identified 69 studies, comprising 6177 individuals diagnosed with FASD from 17 countries: Australia (n = 5), Brazil (n = 2), Canada (n = 15), Chile (n = 4), eastern Europe (Moldova, Romania and Ukraine; n = 1), Germany (n = 1), Israel (n = 1), Lithuania (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 1), Poland (n = 1), Russia (n = 9), South Korea (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), Sweden (n = 1) and United States (n = 25). FAS and FASD prevalence rates were collated for the following five subpopulations: children in care, correctional, special education, specialized clinical and Aboriginal populations. The estimated prevalence of FASD in these special subpopulations was 10–40 times higher compared with the 7.7 per 1000 (95% confidence interval = 4.9–11.7) global FASD prevalence in the general population.

Conclusions
Global subpopulations of children in care, correctional, special education, specialized clinical and Aboriginal populations have a significantly higher prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder compared with the general population, which poses a substantial global health problem.

Introduction
World‐wide, nearly one in 10 (9.8%) women in the general population consume alcohol during pregnancy 1. Prenatal alcohol exposure places these pregnancies at risk for many adverse outcomes, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which is a life‐long disability that requires assistance from a wide range of service providers including health, community and remedial education, among many others 2. FASD has a very broad phenotype 3 and is further complicated by high rates of comorbidity—over 400 disease conditions have been reported to co‐occur in people with FASD 4, with the most prevalent conditions occurring within the congenital malformations, deformities and chromosomal abnormalities (43%) and mental and behavioural disorders (19%) chapters of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD‐10) 5. Some comorbid conditions (e.g. language, auditory, visual, developmental, cognitive, mental and behavioural problems) are highly prevalent, ranging from 50 to 91% 4. Further, it was recently estimated that approximately one in every 13 prenatally alcohol exposed infants will have FASD, which results in approximately 630 000 infants being born with FASD in the world each year 6. Given that FASD is a life‐long disability, it is estimated that more than 11 million individuals between 0 and 18 years of age, and 25 million individuals between 0–40 years of age, have FASD in the general population world‐wide 1.

Several studies have provided estimates of the cost of care for FASD among several populations or service providers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. These cost estimates demonstrate that FASD poses a life‐time cost of approximately 1 million dollars 11 and, as such, the prevalence of FASD is a key factor in understanding the service demands and burden of FASD across different populations and various systems of care.

The prevalence of FASD in the general population as well as patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy (e.g. binge drinking, drinking throughout pregnancy or, most commonly reported, drinking during the first trimester of pregnancy) also appear to vary widely between countries and regions 1, 6, 12. Understandably, the prevalence of FASD varies not only between countries, but also between different subpopulations and service systems 6. However, no study consolidating all available data on the prevalence of FASD among all special subpopulations (e.g. children in care, psychiatric care populations, etc.) currently exists. Consolidating all existing evidence on the prevalence of FASD among special subpopulations will aid in the identification of knowledge gaps and areas of study for which evidence is limited or absent, with the intention of ultimately improving prevalence estimates. Improving estimates of FASD within special subpopulations and service‐defined populations would provide improved data to plan services and budgets to serve people affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.

This is the first study, to our knowledge, to collate prevalence estimates of FASD among special subpopulations (defined by service utilization), utilizing all published studies in the world literature. In addition, country‐, disorder‐ (FASD and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS; the dysmorphic subtype form of FASD)) and population‐specific random‐effects meta‐analyses were conducted for countries with available data. The meta‐analysed FASD prevalence estimates were compared with the global FAS/FASD prevalence 1, 6.

Methods
The systematic literature search and meta‐analyses were conducted and reported according to the standards set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA), provided in the PRISMA Checklist in the Supporting information, Appendix S1
13. We have also adhered to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting guidelines 14.

Comprehensive systematic literature search
A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed to identify all studies that have reported the prevalence of FASD among a special sub‐population. The search was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic databases, including (in alphabetical order): Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Education Resource Information Center, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, PsychINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. The search was conducted using multiple combinations of the following key words: (1) epidemiolog*, frequenc*, incidence*, morbidit*, occurren*, prevalence*, probability, rate* OR statistic*; AND (2) alcohol* embryopath*, alcohol* related* neurodevelopmental* disorder*, alcohol* related* birth defect*, arnd, arbd, fetal* alcohol* effect*, fae, fas, fasd, fetal alcohol syndrome*, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder*, foetal* alcohol* effect, foetal* alcohol syndrome*, foetal* alcohol spectrum disorder*, pfas, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, partial foetal alcohol syndrome, prenatal* alcohol expos* OR pre‐natal* alcohol expos*; AND (3) cohort stud*, cross* sectional stud*, prospective cohort stud* OR retrospective cohort stud*. The search was performed to identify studies published between 1 November 1973 and 1 December 2018, without language or geographical restrictions. Further, the content pages of the major epidemiological journals, as well as citations in the relevant articles, were manually screened. The full review protocol is available in PROSPERO [includes FASD prevalence in (a) general and (b) special sub‐populations; http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), registration number CRD42016033837].

Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Articles were retained if they: (a) consisted of original, quantitative research published in a peer‐reviewed journal or scholarly report; and (b) involved a measurement of the prevalence of FASD and/or FAS among a service‐defined population. Additionally, articles were retained if they: (a) provided a measure of uncertainty (confidence interval or standard error); or (b) provided the number of cases or sample size (information to derive a measure of uncertainty). Articles were excluded if they: (a) lacked FASD prevalence data; or (b) contained prevalence estimates not specific to special subpopulations (i.e. general populations only). For a detailed list of criteria assessed for each included study please refer to the Supporting information, Appendix S2.

Study selection and data extraction
Study selection began by screening titles and abstracts for inclusion. Then, full‐text articles of all studies screened as potentially relevant were considered. A data extraction form was developed to record relevant information, such as location of the study (country; province/territory or state), study year(s), sample size, setting, number of cases (by diagnostic category), prevalence (by diagnostic category), diagnostic guideline used, sex distribution of sample, age range of sample and method of ascertainment. Two investigators conducted each study selection step; any disagreements were reconciled by team discussion. All data were extracted by one investigator and then independently cross‐checked by a second investigator; all discrepancies were reconciled by team discussion. Non‐English‐language studies deemed to be potentially relevant were translated either by colleagues fluent in the respective language or using Google Translate (and subsequently cross‐checked by a native speaker).

Critical appraisal of included studies
The critical appraisal of each study was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool, specifically designed for use in systematic reviews addressing questions of prevalence 15. The following seven criteria were used: (i) representativeness of the sample to the target population, (ii) appropriate recruitment of participants, (iii) adequate sample size, (iv) detailed description of participants and setting, (v) sufficient coverage of the identified sample, (vi) use of an objective, standard criteria for ascertaining FASD and (vii) appropriateness of statistical analysis. The explanation of every criterion included in this tool is available in the Supporting information, Appendix S2.

Two investigators independently appraised the quality of each study, and all discrepancies in quality ratings were reconciled by team discussion.

Meta‐analysis
Country‐, disorder‐ (FAS and FASD, inclusive of FAS) and population‐specific meta‐analyses were performed for those countries with two or more studies that used active case ascertainment (ACA; where cases are actively sought and diagnosed) and/or clinic‐based methods (prospectively conducted in prenatal clinics or hospitals) and specified the diagnostic criteria used to ascertain cases of FAS/FASD in the respective population. Although studies that utilized passive surveillance (PS) methods (the use of existing record collections, e.g. birth certificates, registries, medical charts, adoption records) were included in the current review, they were not used in the meta‐analyses, as they are known to produce underestimates of the prevalence 16. It is well known that the majority of the countries do not have the capacity and/or resources to use the ACA approach to identify FASD cases because FASD diagnosis requires a multi‐disciplinary team and specialized clinical skills. Due to these circumstances, PS is the only option for the majority of the countries.

For all analyses, logit‐transformed results were pooled using a Bayesian meta‐analysis and non‐informative (flat) prior distributions. The combined estimates were based on the mean of the posterior distributions and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. The between‐study variances were quantified using the τ2 and I
2 statistics 17. All models assumed fixed effects, as between‐study heterogeneity is difficult to assess when there are only a small number of studies 17. Publication bias was tested by visually inspecting a funnel plot for skewed distribution, using a ranked correlation test proposed by Begg & Mazumdar 18 and by employing a weighted regression test proposed by Egger and colleagues 19 (see the Supporting information, Appendix S3). Publication bias was assessed, as studies which measure FAS and FASD may have been established in specific segments of subpopulations where the prevalence of FAS and/or FASD is high (compared to other segments of the same subpopulation). Analyses were performed using the statistical software R, version 3.3.2 20, and Stata statistical software, version 14.2 21.

Results
A total of 11 871 studies were identified in the search. Sixty‐nine studies, comprising 6177 individuals diagnosed with FASD in total, were retained for data extraction. These studies represented the following 17 countries: Australia (n = 5), Brazil (n = 2), Canada (n = 15), Chile (n = 4), eastern Europe (Moldova, Romania and Ukraine; n = 1), Germany (n = 1), Israel (n = 1), Lithuania (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 1), Poland (n = 1), Russia (n = 9), South Korea (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), Sweden (n = 1) and the United States (n = 25). A schematic diagram depicting the search strategy employed is presented in Fig. 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram depicting the search strategy employed

Following the identification of 69 studies, they were categorized into the following five special subpopulations: children in care (e.g. adoptees, foster children; n = 36), correctional (n = 8), special education (n = 3), specialized clinical (n = 5) and Aboriginal (n = 17).

The quality appraisals of the included studies indicated that 100% (n = 69) of studies were conducted on samples that were representative of the target population; 97.1% (n = 67) of studies appropriately recruited participants; 65.2% (n = 45) of studies had an adequate sample size; 84.1% (n = 58) of studies provided a detailed description of participants and setting; 95.7% (n = 66) of studies had sufficient coverage of the identified sample; 60.9% (n = 42) of studies used objective, standard criteria for ascertaining FASD; and 100% (n = 69) of studies used an appropriate statistical analysis. Overall, 29.0% (n = 20) of studies met all seven criteria. The quality appraisals of the included studies are presented in the Supporting information, Appendix S2.

Prevalence of FASD among children in care
The prevalence of FASD among children in care was available for the following countries: Brazil (n = 1), Canada (n = 4), Chile (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Israel (n = 1), Lithuania (n = 1), the Netherlands (n = 1), Poland (n = 1), Russia (n = 9), Spain (n = 1), Sweden (n = 1) and the United States (n = 12); one study 22 reported the prevalence of FAS among children in care from eastern Europe (Moldova, Romania and Ukraine; n = 1). Twenty studies used ACA, two studies used clinic‐based methods, 10 studies used PS and four studies used mixed methods. Twenty (of 36) studies reported the diagnostic guideline/case definition used, with the majority (35.0%) using the four‐digit diagnostic code 23 (see Table 1).

The prevalence of FAS was reported to be the lowest among pre‐adoption children in orphanages and foster care in eastern Europe at 0.0 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 22 and the highest among orphanages for children with developmental abnormalities in Russia at 680.0 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 48, with median 79.1. The prevalence of FASD was reported to be the lowest among permanent wards in Canada at 32.6 per 1000 (obtained via PS) 26 and the highest among children in child welfare and homes for those with mental deficiencies in Chile at 611.7 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 32, with median 177.3 per 1000.

A meta‐analysis on the prevalence of FAS/FASD among children in care was conducted for the following three countries: Chile, Russia and the United States. Based on two studies 30, 32, the pooled prevalence of FAS and FASD among children in care in Chile was estimated to be 51.9 per 1000 (95% CI = 40.3–64.9 per 1000) and 312.4 per 1000 (95% CI = 283.6–339.1 per 1000), respectively. In Russia, the pooled prevalence of FAS among children in care was estimated to be 95.5 per 1000 (95% CI = 85.3–105.4 per 1000) 39, 41, 44, 46, 47. The pooled prevalence of FAS and FASD among children in care in the United States was estimated to be 142.3 per 1000 (95% CI = 117.3–167.8 per 1000) 51, 53, 54 and 251.5 per 1000 (95% CI = 220.0–281.7 per 1000) 54, 57, 61, respectively (Table 2 and Figs 2 and 3).

Prevalence of FASD among correctional populations
The prevalence of FASD among correctional populations was available for three countries: Australia (n = 1), Canada (n = 6) and the United States (n = 1). Two studies used ACA, one study used clinic‐based methods, four studies used PS and one study used mixed methods. Five (of eight) studies reported the diagnostic guideline/case definition used; with the majority (28.6%) using the 2005 Canadian diagnostic guidelines 65 (see Table 3).

In Australia, the prevalence of FASD among a correctional population (73.7% were Aboriginal) was reported to be 363.6 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 66. In Canada, the reported prevalence of FAS and FASD ranged from 0.0 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 71 to 10.5 per 1000 (obtained via clinic‐based methods) 69 and 17.5 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 66 to 233.5 per 1000 (obtained via clinic‐based methods) 69, with median 108.7. In the United States, the reported prevalence of FAS was 0.0003 per 1000 (obtained via PS) 75. The medians for FAS and FASD prevalence estimates in this special subpopulation (all countries) were 0.05 per 1000 and 112.8 per 1000, respectively. The pooled prevalence of FASD among adults in the correctional system in Canada was estimated to be 146.7 per 1000 (95% CI = 98.2–204.9 per 1000) 70, 71 (see Table 2 and Figs 2 and 3).

Prevalence of FASD among special education populations
The prevalence of FASD among special education populations was available for Chile (n = 2) and South Korea (n = 1). The reported prevalence of FAS and FASD among special education populations, obtained via ACA using the guidelines established by the Fetal Alcohol Study Group of the RSA 31, ranged from 21.1 per 1000 77 to 42.3 per 1000 78 with median 33.7 for FAS, and 75.8 per 1000 77 to 88.1 per 1000 76 with median 82.0 for FASD. The reported prevalence of FAS among a special education population in South Korea was 42.3 per 1000 (obtained via ACA using a study‐specific case definition) 78 (see Table 3).

The pooled prevalence of FAS and FASD among special education populations in Chile was estimated to be 29.1 per 1000 (95% CI = 19.2–42.0 per 1000) 76, 77 and 84.2 per 1000 (95% CI = 66.6–103.1 per 1000) 76, 77, respectively (see Table 2 and Figs 2 and 3).

Prevalence of FASD among specialized clinical populations
The prevalence of FASD among specialized clinical populations was available for two countries: Brazil (n = 1) and the United States (n = 4). Three studies used clinic‐based methods and two studies used PS. The reported prevalence of FAS among babies referred to genetic clinics in Brazil was 1.0 per 1000 (obtained via PS; diagnostic guideline/case definition used not specified) 79. The prevalence of FASD was reported for three specialized clinical populations in the United States: psychiatric care population (n = 2), patients evaluated at genetic clinics (n = 1) and a developmentally disabled clinical population (n = 1). One study 80 used the DSM‐5 criteria of ND‐PAE 81 and one study 83 used the four‐digit diagnostic code 23; the remaining two studies did not report the diagnostic guideline/case definition used. The lowest prevalence of FAS was reported among patients evaluated at genetic clinics at 6.4 per 1000 (obtained via clinic‐based methods) 82 and the highest prevalence was reported among a psychiatric care population at 82.0 per 1000 (obtained via PS) 83, with median 10.4. The lowest prevalence of FASD was reported among a developmentally disabled clinical population at 21.0 per 1000 (obtained via clinic‐based methods) 84 and the highest among a psychiatric care population at 142.4 per 1000 (obtained via clinic‐based methods) 80, with median 81.7 (see Table 3).

Based on inclusion criteria, it was not possible to conduct a meta‐analysis on the prevalence of FAS/FASD among specialized clinical populations for any country.

Prevalence of FASD among aboriginal populations
The prevalence of FASD among Aboriginal populations was available for three countries: Australia (n = 4), Canada (n = 5) and the United States (n = 8). Seven studies used ACA, eight studies used PS and two studies used mixed methods. Twelve (of 17) studies reported the diagnostic guideline/case definition used, with the majority (17.6%) using the guidelines established by the Fetal Alcohol Study Group of the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) 31 (see Table 3).

In Australia, the reported prevalence of FAS and FASD ranged from 2.0 per 1000 (obtained via PS and clinic‐based methods) 86 to 9.3 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 85, with median 5.7 (FAS), and 4.1 per 1000 (obtained via PS) 88 to 194.4 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 85, with median 9.7 (FASD), respectively. In Canada, the reported prevalence of FAS and FASD ranged from 7.2 per 1000 (obtained via ACA and PS) 94 to 120.7 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 92, with median 61.8, and 7.0 per 1000 (obtained via PS) 93 to 189.7 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 92, with median 66.9, respectively. In the United States, the reported prevalence of FAS and FASD ranged from 0.4 per 1000 (obtained via PS) 102 to 9.3 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 103, with median 2.8 for FAS, and 3.7 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 103 to 18.7 per 1000 (obtained via ACA) 103, with median 11.2, for FASD.

In Australia, the pooled prevalence of FAS and FASD among Aboriginal populations was estimated to be 2.3 per 1000 (95% CI = 1.4–3.5 per 1000) 85, 86 and 14.8 per 1000 (95% CI = 11.4–18.6 per 1000), respectively. In Canada, the pooled prevalence of FAS and FASD among Aboriginal populations was estimated to be 60.8 per 1000 (95% CI = 42.1–83.4 per 1000) 91, 92, 94 and 43.6 per 1000 (95% CI = 37.9–49.3 per 1000) 90, 91, 92, respectively. The pooled prevalence of FAS and FASD among Aboriginal populations in the United States was estimated to be 2.8 per 1000 (95% CI = 2.2–3.5 per 1000) 98, 101, 103 and 4.4 per 1000 (95% CI = 3.5–5.3 per 1000) 101, 103, respectively (see Table 2 and Figs 2 and 3).

The pooled prevalence and results of the tests of heterogeneity and publication bias for the meta‐analyses on the prevalence of FAS and FASD among subpopulations by country are presented in the Supporting information, Appendix S3.

Comparison of FASD prevalence in special subpopulations versus global FASD prevalence in general population
The meta‐analysed prevalence estimates of FASD among special subpopulations appear to far exceed those found among the general population. For example, compared to the recently estimated global prevalence of FASD in the general population (7.7 per 1000; 95% CI = 4.9–11.7) 6, the prevalence among children in care was 32 times higher in the United States (251.5 per 1000; 95% CI = 220.0–281.7) 54, 57, 61 and 40 times higher in Chile (312.4 per 1000; 95% CI = 283.6, 339.1) 30, 32; the prevalence among adults in the Canadian correctional system (146.7 per 1000; 95% CI = 98.2, 204.9) 70, 71 was 19 times higher; and the prevalence among special education populations in Chile (84.2 per 1000; 95% CI = 66.6–103.1) 76, 77 was over 10 times higher. Overall, the estimated prevalence of FASD in these special sub‐populations was 10‐40 times higher compared with the prevalence estimate for the global general population: 7.7 per 1000 (95% confidence interval: 4.9‐11.7).

Further, the prevalence reported in the individual studies is even more alarming. For instance, the prevalence of FASD among children in care with mental deficiencies in Chile was reported to be 620 per 1000 32, among adoptees from eastern Europe it was more than 520 per 1000 50 and among children residing in orphanages in Lithuania it was approximately 400 per 1000 36. The highest prevalence of FAS, between 460 and 680 per 1000, was reported in Russia in orphanages for children with developmental abnormalities 48. Additionally, the prevalence of FASD among youth in correctional services was reported to be more than 230 per 1000 in Canada 69 and more than 140 per 1000 among psychiatric care populations in the United States 80.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that the prevalence of FASD is highly variable, and disproportionately impacts some special subpopulations, and this is not unexpected given the context of the origin populations and the life‐course of individuals with FASD. In general, children are often placed in care due to a number of unfavourable circumstances, such as parental alcohol and/or other drug problems, abuse and/or neglect, abandonment and young maternal age. These circumstances are associated with an increased probability that a child had been exposed to alcohol in utero
104. If appropriate diagnosis, interventions and support services are not put in place early in life and maintained throughout their life, many youth and adults with FASD are at a high risk for becoming involved in the legal system, either as offenders or as victims. It was estimated that youth with FASD are 19 times more likely to be incarcerated than youth without FASD on any given day in a specific year 105. Lastly, individuals with FASD are likely to suffer from developmental delay, learning problems and mental health problems 4; therefore, a high prevalence among special education populations (e.g. in special schools for mentally handicapped children) and specialized clinical populations (e.g. in psychiatric care) is not surprising.

Several factors contribute to the prevalence of FASD in Aboriginal populations. For example, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy in the Aboriginal populations of the United States and Canada were found to be approximately three to four times higher, respectively, compared to the general population 106. Even more alarmingly, approximately 20% of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy engage in binge drinking in the Aboriginal populations compared to 3% in the general population in both countries 106. The high prevalence of alcohol consumption and FASD in some Aboriginal populations must be understood within the historical and social context of colonization and the socio‐demographic realities. Intergenerational impacts of colonial history, including trauma, residential school experiences and economic and social marginalization, contribute to alcohol use in Aboriginal communities 107, 108.

While all these subpopulations share many risk markers, it is not clear whether FASD results in a common risk factor or impairment that increases risk for contact with certain service systems. It is also unclear whether the variation in the prevalence of FASD among the special subpopulations identified is due to differences in rates or patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure, dosimetry or increased susceptibility to alcohol exposure prenatally. Both missed diagnoses and underdiagnoses of FASD confound efforts to better understand these differences 54. What is clear, however, is that exposure to alcohol prenatally that leads to a diagnosis of FASD has predictive implications with respect to adversity. In the past, it could be argued that we had insufficient information on FASD to make public policy recommendations. We now have convincing evidence that FASD is a relatively prevalent alcohol‐related disorder that greatly increases the risk of long‐term adversity. As such, public policy and clinical care for people with FASD needs to change to respond to such predictable outcomes. The data presented in this study have important implications for health‐care providers, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, individuals working within the justice and child welfare systems, policymakers and, most importantly, for people affected with FASD and their families. These prevalence estimates are crucial for promoting early identification of FASD and provision of prevention and care interventions as well as for informing policymakers and service providers about the overall impact of FASD on population health. In addition, these prevalence estimates will help to generate policy and programme support for services required by people with FASD. Routine screening protocols should be established for identification of children, youth and adults in different settings such as child welfare, special education, justice system and others in order to provide them with appropriate support and early interventions. Service providers should be trained on FASD awareness, identification and interventions of people with higher risk for prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD.

There are several limitations in this study. First, FASD prevalence estimates were derived over an approximately 40‐year time‐span, so the prevalence of FASD, for example, in an American Indian community in the 1980s may not be relevant at all to current prevalence in that community, nor comparable to the prevalence in an aboriginal community in Australia captured 30 years later. Specifically, the majority of the studies reporting prevalence of FASD among Aboriginal populations in Canada are 2–3 decades old and suffer from many methodological limitations 90, 91, 92, 94, and thus those existing data are not applicable for decision‐making purposes and rigorous active case ascertainment studies are urgently needed in Canada. Further, outdated studies from Australia, which are based on PS, report an unrealistically low prevalence of FASD (lower or slightly above 1%) among Aboriginal populations 86, 89. However, a recent ACA study reported the prevalence of FASD among Aboriginal populations of Australia to be over 19% 85.

Further, existing studies suffer from variability in the quality and inconsistency in the methods used among them. Specifically, studies used 12 different diagnostic criteria to classify children or adults as FAS or FASD (all of which have substantial lack of overlap 109, not to mention that these studies had widely varying criteria for documenting quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption required. It is also possible that some prevalence studies were initiated due to the suspected high rate of FASD in these settings, demonstrated by an increased demand to service providers or increased health‐care cost, which may lead to overestimated results.

There are multiple other special subpopulations impacted by increased rates of FASD—two examples are children whose mothers are in treatment for substance use disorder(s) and infants requiring neonatal intensive care. However, there are no studies that examined the prevalence of FASD in these special subpopulations. Further, 45 years after discovering FAS, we found that it was not possible to conduct meta‐analyses among low socio‐economic populations and specialized clinical populations due to insufficient data; thus, rigorous research is urgently needed to appreciate those populations most impacted by FASD.

It appears that prenatal alcohol exposure defines a high‐risk population in need of long‐term monitoring 110. Our ability to develop enhanced care and monitoring of this high‐risk population (individuals with FASD) is limited by the very low rates of diagnosis for all age groups. For adults, diagnosis is often limited by difficulty determining prenatal alcohol exposure status (especially in cases where the biological mother is unknown) and uncertainty about the adult phenotype of FASD. This is even more problematic in elderly people. For correctional populations in particular, the setting may also result in a limited diagnostic capacity for FASD. Providing FASD diagnoses is further limited by a lack of resources, an impacted health‐care referral system and stigmatization of maternal alcohol consumption. In addition, current diagnostic guidelines have limited agreement 110, 111. Diagnostic screening and staff training on FASD in the respective systems/institutions are crucial in order to ensure that FASD‐affected individuals are receiving the appropriate care and treatment.

The results indicate that there is a critical need for ACA prevalence studies to be conducted among these populations/within these service systems in almost all countries throughout the world. Measuring and monitoring the prevalence of FASD and alcohol consumption during pregnancy over time in both the general population and population subgroups are crucial for understanding and identifying vulnerable populations, targeting prevention and treatment resources and establishing baselines to evaluate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies. A comprehensive surveillance system could also allow for a better understanding of the associated morbidity and mortality rates, quality‐of‐life indicators and service utilization rates of affected individuals. This will reduce the risk of the development of other common adverse outcomes that often occur in individuals with FASD later in life, such as school failure and dropout, mental health problems, inappropriate sexual behaviour, alcohol and other drug problems, unemployment, dependent living and homelessness, as well as involvement with the law and incarceration 112.

Prenatal alcohol exposure is preventable through public health messaging and treatment of substance use disorder(s) in mothers. It is absolutely necessary to continue to improve prevention of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, screening strategies, targeted interventions for women of childbearing age with substance use problems, diagnosis‐informed care and the provision of support for people with FASD and their families, especially in these special sub‐populations.
