==== Body
Background
Emergency Departments need to provide adequate acute medical care in limited time frames; patients could leave ED not receiving the desired care either Without Being Seen by a doctor (Leave Without Being Seen by a doctor, LWBS) or Against Medical Advice (Discharge Against Medical Advice, DAMA). Self-discharge occurrence represents an important marker of emergency care quality; LWBS may be related to healthcare service inappropriate access and process of care, while DAMA rate may lead to an increased risk of mortality and re-admissions.

A survey analysis conducted by using the 2009-2011 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) in the United States have shown that 2.62% of patients left ED without completing medical care; of these visits 67.7% were LWBS and 32.3% were DAMA patients. Increased rates of LWBS patients were associated with higher ED volumes and ED crowding; these patients identified waiting times as a major reason for leaving before medical assessment. Conversely, high rates of patients DAMA have not been shown to correlate with ED overcrowding, but were older and had higher acuity visits than the LWBS patients (1). Previous research evidenced that many of these patients, who leave before completing ED care, were vulnerable, with poor overall access to care (2).

These data underline the importance to clearly identify the reasons that lead patients to leave ED, in order to optimize the quality of acute medical care. However only limited data have been published related to Italian contest. Available evidence on this topic refer mainly to American or Australian healthcare system and it cannot be directly transferred to the National Italian healthcare system. Up to our knowledge the only Italian study on this issue is limited to LWBS patients and showed a rate of 1.34% (3).

This study aims to identify frequency of uncompleted ED admission, determine characteristics of self-discharged patients and subsequently recognise patient and organization factors associated with early ED leaving compared to completed ED care episodes.

Methods
A retrospective observational study was conducted. All admissions to EDs of University Hospital Trust of Verona during 2017 were included; accesses in General, Paediatric and Obstetrics-Gynecology Emergency Departments were considered. Admissions for non-medical purposes as work-related accident certificates (I.N.A.I.L. certificates), red triage category (life threatening conditions) and people dead on arrival at ED were excluded from the analysis.

Data were collected from the information system for monitoring assistance in Emergency-Urgency (EMUR_PS) and from ED medical chart. From EMUR_PS dataset were collected the following information: gender, age, level of consciousness upon arrival, trauma or non trauma status, triage category (1-emergent/red, 2-urgent/yellow, 3-semi-urgent/green and 4-not urgent/white), time of presentation, admission and discharge and patient’s nationality. From ED medical charts were collected information regarding patient’s admission in a fast track pathway (orthopedic and traumatological, ophthalmological, dermatological, ENT fast track pathways), mode of referral (own decision or referred by physician), requirement of a psychiatric consult. Patients were stratified in 9 age-groups. Moreover, the daily number of ED admissions was calculated and its percentile distribution was used to classify ED crowding in five classes (from 1-very low affluence to 5-very high affluence).

Data Analysis
All analyses were performed using ED Admission as unit of analysis. Patients who left ED at their own decision were classified by EMUR_PS “outcome status” variable into LWBS and DAMA; they were compared to admission of those who completed ED-treatment with respect to all collected variables.

Categorical data were compared using the Chi-squared test while T-test or Mann-Whitney test were performed for continuous variables. Logistic univariate analyses were performed to identify variables affecting decision to leave ED before completing all requested care; significant associated variables were included in the multiple logistic regression model to calculate adjusted Odds Ratio. A level of significant of 0.05 was considered for all the performed analyses. All analyses were performed using STATA version 15.

Results
A total of 133,418 episodes of care accesses to the AOUI Verona Emergency Departments occurred during 2017, involving 90,809 individual patients. Among these admissions, 4,345 were non-medical purposes referred accesses (issuing I.N.A.I.L. certificates) and 1,893 were red triage category; they were excluded leaving a final dataset of 127,180 ED visits among 89,595 patients. 121,279 episodes of care completed ED treatment while 5,901 (4.64%) resulted uncompleted; LWBS were 4,664 (79.04%) and DAMA were 1,237 (20.96%).

Table 1 shows ED Access general characteristics for completed and uncompleted ED treatment. Those who leave ED before or against medical advice compared to those who completed ED care tended to be younger (mean age of 39.35 vs. 45.56, p<0.01). Among patient who leave ED higher frequencies were observed in the 35 to 44 years old (16.94%) and in the 55 to 64 years old age groups (16.04%). Those who leave ED tended to have an higher male proportion (54.65% vs. 47.11%, p<0.01; OR: 0.739, 95%CI: 0.701-0.778), a higher prevalence of not Italian citizens (26.44% vs. 19.23%, p<0.01; OR: 1.509, 95%CI: 1.422-1.602) and higher rate of patient referred by own decision (90.88% vs. 80.10%, p<0.01; OR: 2.475, 95%CI: 2.263-2.708).

Among ED visits characteristics, self discharged patients showed an higher prevalence of white triage category (52.11% vs 24.43%, p<0.01; OR: 17.576; 95%CI: 15.209-20.313), an higher requirement of a psychiatric consult (6.31% vs. 1.09%, p<0.01; OR: 6.116, 95%CI: 4.832-7.740) and an higher proportion of traumatic complaints (26.40% vs. 22.30%, p<0.01; OR: 0.800, 95%CI: 0.754-0.849). Self-discharged patients attended more frequently to General ED (92.17% vs. 77.74%, p<0.01), out of a fast track pathway (1.95% vs. 9.28%, p<0.01; OR:0.183, 95%CI: 0.152-0.222), during evening time - from 6.00 pm to 11.59 pm (44.28% vs. 24.69%, p<0.01; OR: 1.820, 95%CI: 1.650-2.007), with an higher proportion on Sunday and Monday (respectively 15.73% vs. 13.56%, p<0.01 and 17.88 vs. 15.40%, p<0.01; OR: 1.001, 95%CI: 0.914-1.096) and during spring and winter (respectively 29.57% vs. 5.78% and 27.37% vs. 24.83 % p<0.01). In January and April the highest self discharge frequency (10.34% and 11.15% respectively) was observed. Finally regarding “daily crowding”, an increasing leaving risk trend was identified as increased the ED affluence (Table 1).

Once adjusted, according to Multivariate regression model, significant associated variables with the ED leaving resulted: lower age group, male patient, lack of inclusion in fast track pathway, General ED access, Sunday as day of presentation, triaged as non urgent or semi urgent, necessity of psychiatric consult, foreign origin and night and evening as time of presentation. Table 2 shows the results of multivariate analysis.

Discussion
Nowadays patient’s dissatisfaction in the provided care is becoming a major concern for healthcare systems, that is particularly evident in service access. Whenever waiting time becomes too long in relation to perceived need to medical intervention, the Emergency department becomes the only citizen’s opportunity to get immediate service’s access; as a consequence, ED becomes overcrowded by low acuity pathologies (4). Reducing ED leaving occurrence represents a major goal of healthcare systems as regards to ED process quality and safety of care; identifying factor associated to higher rate of ED leaving is essential to implement targeted intervention.

Among patients who leave ED before completing care about eighty percent were LWBS, demonstrating a higher rate compared to previous studies; the reason could be found in different healthcare systems and the relative distinct patient payment participation (2).

Multivariate analysis evidences the highest risk of ED leaving among paediatric age group, up to more than three times higher than elderly; on the other hand, Paediatric ED access resulted a significant protective factor. This apparently contrasting result may be related to improper use of general rather than paediatric ED. Such result underlines the importance to realize dedicated pathway for paediatric subpopulation; moreover, awareness of the factors involved in ED service parent’s perception should facilitate successful interventions for this potentially vulnerable group (5).

Patients requiring psychiatric consult, as previously evidenced by other studies, showed higher risk of self-discharge; this result refers only to DAMA patients since in LWBS patients it can’t be estimated. According to literature, ED leaving among psychiatric patients is not ascribable only to patient’s but also to provider’s factors (6,7). The need to develop adequate communicative and relational skills is particularly important for this specific subgroup. Psychiatric patients represent a frail chronic population and an adequate management of acute state may be essential to prevent relapses; a sub-analysis on this population could be helpful to improve ED care with dedicated pathway.

Like other studies we found higher risk of LWBS and DAMA in male population and in foreign origin patient’s (3, 7, 10). Non-Italian citizens are at higher risk to have a limited access to primary care assistance, consequently they tend to overuse ED service for low acuity situations (8).

Finally, among patient related factors, non-urgent triage category resulted at higher risk of uncompleted ED care, as confirmed by literature.

Considering service’s related factors, ED type and fast track pathway resulted strongly associated to ED leaving; specifically, Paediatric and Obstetric-Gynaecologic ED demonstrated lower leaving risk as the patient inclusion in a fast track pathway. Such result underlines how the development of a patient centre emergency organization have generalised positive impact on the quality of care and specifically may reduce LWBS and DAMA rate (9).

The highest rate of uncompleted care was observed on Sunday and during evening/night time; at these time span patient access to primary care is limited to continuity of care services as doctor on duty. This raise questions on whether territorial services are actually perceived by patients as a valid alternative to ED for low acuity care; this result confirms the need to strengthen primary care services in order to guarantee appropriate care use.

In our study the multivariate analysis did not confirm the correlation between uncompleted care and ED overcrowding observed in univariate analysis. This result seems to be in contrast with other observational studies which found a significant correlation with waiting time (2, 3).

This study suffers from some limitations. First of all, it took place in a single third level hospital trust; this might limit results generalization, since larger hospitals tend to have higher proportion of LWBS (10). Secondly, data were mostly collected from administrative EMUR_PS dataset even if when available they were supplemented with clinical charts information. Differently from DAMA patients, it was possible to recognize only a few clinical information on LWBS patient; this impeded to perform sub-analysis including all collected variables with limited possibilities to plan specific interventional strategies as already underlined by other observational studies (10). Despite these limitation, the study was able to provide an overall view of risk factors associated to ED leaving in a universalistic healthcare system; results have shown the necessity to implement primary-ED integrated pathway care, to develop patient’s awareness on appropriate use of Emergency Care, and finally to improve communication strategies for HCP and specific non-technical skills for ED team. In conclusion these interventions need to be oriented to frail sub-population such as foreign origin, paediatric and psychiatric patients according to our results to be at higher risk of uncompleted ED treatment.
