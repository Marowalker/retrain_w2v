LicenseBackground: Thousands of caregivers around the world take care
of impaired people, with negative repercussions on their physical,
psychological, social and economic resources. The need to promote
caregivers’ wellbeing is internationally recognized, thus reducing health
inequalities. Mindfulness is a powerful tool, directly related to the reduction
of stress, able to increase skills and attitudes promoting well-being. The basis
of this project of community development based on active health, is the
self-care achieved through mindfulness. Aims: The overall aim
of this project is to improve the caregivers’ health and quality of life
through community mapping strategies and mindfulness. Methods:
According to the salutogenic model, and to the model of community development
based on active health (ABCD) we will create a map of the caregivers’
internal and external health assets. The project will have a participatory
action research methodology, and it will go throygh five different phases, with
mindfulness as a central tool. Results: At the end of the
project, results will be analyzed referring to structures, processes and
objective and subjective outcomes. Conclusions: At the end of
the project, we will evaluate if the Salutogenic ABCD methodology along with
Mindfulness, will be able to reduce health inequalities improving
caregivers’ wellbeing.

Introduction
All over the world, thousands of people need continuous assistance, and thousands of
people have to take care of them. These are the caregivers, and it is estimated that
there are 225,000 only in Spain, almost always women with an average age between 50
and 70 years. The evidence shows the negative repercussions on physical,
psychological, social and economic resources that caring for others can have on
these people. However, social, cultural, economic factors and factors such as gender
are, in this case, much more relevant and determinant in the health disparities of
the caregivers’ population (1).
Different strategies at national and European level recognize the need to promote
care for caregivers. The caregiver must take care of himself to guarantee a good
level of care for another person but above all to maintain his health and
well-being. But to take care of himself he must be able to ask for help, and request
support from professionals and from his networks. The term Mindfulness taken from
the Pali language, meaning full awareness or conscious attention to the present
moment (2), is considered as one of the most
powerful “tools” for understanding one’s own thoughts,
emotions, and body signals, directly related, not only with the reduction of stress
levels, but also with the increase of skills and attitudes (empathy, self-awareness,
calm, concentration, attention, kindness) that promote well-being in people who
practice it (3).

Mindfulness is also a lifestyle. A way of “being” against the
“doing” way, continuously activated in the West countries. In other
words, Mindfulness is a life philosophy. Practicing Mindfulness in a continuous way,
encourages the development of this philosophy, and so, over time, can become a
stable characteristic making the person “Mindful”, that means with an
attitude of (4-5): curiosity for mental contents, acceptance of the present
moment, openness to mental contents, no judgment towards the present experience,
detachment, and kindness / love / affection. Therefore, an attitude of self-care and
self-acceptance in the present moment, without which it is really difficult to
develop full awareness.

Specifically, Minfulness is based on the practice of exercises (or meditations),
centered on three fundamental pillars: Samatha (attention, concentration, calm),
Vipassana (contemplation, mental clarity) and Metta (loving kindness).

At the beginning of Mindfulness practice, people perform Samatha exercises, to learn
to keep their attention on a specific point in a quiet state, becoming aware of what
happens. Subsequently Vipassana is practiced, including the contemplation of mental
contents (thoughts, emotions) with an attitude on letting them flow freely. However,
Metta is the prerequisite of the whole practice, as Mindfulness implies a person
being always in a state of loving kindness, goodness, affection, and benevolence
towards himself.

The different meditation exercises (fully shown in in table 1) can basically be divided into:

Table 1. List of Mindfulness Meditations

	
1. - Formal meditations.

a) Sitting practices: meditations linked to the breath, to internal and external
stimuli, to thoughts and emotions (Tonglen, Metta, Body-Scan)

b) Standing practices: walking meditations or conscious walking including
“sensory”, “synupodal rhythm” and “bodily
movements and sensations”.

2. - Informal meditations

Practices carried out taking advantage of any action put into practice during the
day, being fully aware as brushing teeth, eating, listening to someone

3. - Mini-meditations.

Very short exercises (usually focused on breathing) performed at different times of
the day.

Practicing Mindfulness can change the relationship of a person with himself, also
learning to respond in a different way to stressful situations, encouraging
adjustment. This process of empowering one’s resources in favor of a better
adjustment is extremely close the “salutogenic model” (6), which shows how people who are able to
adjust to stressful situations can maintain a good health. Antonovsky identifies
among the characteristics underlying the ability to promote health, the sense of
coherence, as “a person’s view of life and capacity to respond to
stressful situations. It is a global orientation to view as structured, manageable,
and meaningful. It is a personal way of thinking, benefit and use, and re-use the
resources at their disposal “(7). We
can therefore find a great affinity between this characteristic and the awareness of
rising from practicing Mindfulness. Awareness seems to offer people the resources
and opportunities to move towards the health pole on the Antonovsky’s
continuum (figure 1).

Figure 1. Antonovsky’s continuum

Furthermore, Mindfulness also seems to have a direct connection with the
health-related conceptual framework of health developed by Morgan and Ziglio (8). According to this framework a health asset
is “any factor or resource that increases the capacity of individuals,
communities or populations to maintain health and well-being”. According to
Botello and col., health assets can be connected to people, organizations and
associations, institutions, economy, culture and available infrastructures (9). However, in the ABCD “Assets Based
Community Development” methodology, the first basic component of assets is
the individual one given by capacities, abilities and gifts of every single person
(10, 11). Mindfulness can be central in the identification of these
characteristics, which require self-awareness, together with a self-care attitude
that allows to identify the best decisions and actions for oneself moment by
moment.

As previously mentioned, the task of taking care of others is a complex activity. It
requires dedication, often exclusive, so that the person treated is in the best
physical, emotional and environmental conditions. This requires caregivers to use a
multitude of resources and skills, psychological, behavioral, and attitudinal. These
resources can be more or less developed in each caregiver, and require a great
awareness of himself and of his own state, to prevent the onset of burnout related
to his role (12-13).

But far more important, the caregiver needs to learn how to take care of himself.

On a cognitive level (thoughts), self-care means being able to identify
thoughts accepting them, with the awareness of not being the thought itself. On an
emotional level (emotions), self-care involves the identification
of the emotion in the body, giving it an origin (internal and / or external) and
labeling it. This can allow the person to find out which behavior is triggered by
this emotion and the consequences it could have, from a perspective of acceptance
and benevolence towards any kind of emotion. On a social level,
self-care means being able to reconnect with one’s own, personal priorities.
Exactly in this aspect, the practice of Mindfulness can lead to a significant
improvement in life and in carrying out of the role of caregiver. So the basis of
this proposed community development project, focused on the identification of health
assets, is self-care.

Aims
Overall aim
The main aim of this project is to improve the health and quality of life, real
and perceived, in caregivers, through community mapping strategies and
Mindfulness.

Specific aims
- Identifying and enhancing individual and environmental resources that can be
health assets for caregivers;

- Including caregivers in their salutogenic empowerment;

- Developing Mindfulness skills in caregivers;

- Encouraging and developing higher levels of personal self-care in
caregivers;

- Strengthening the caregivers’ sense of coherence;

-Promoting networks and relationships, among caregivers providing mutual
assistance, aid, and empowerment;

- Identifying elements that can be improved in the community and in the
caregivers.

Methods
Starting from the salutogenic model, and using the tool of health assets mapping
(according to the ABCD model of Kretzman & Mcknight), we will map the
population, environment and logistic assets needed to promote this work perspective
(14-18). The project proposed here, uses a participatory action research
methodology. The target population will consist of female caregivers working the
same environment (i.e. same neighborhood) and recruited in health houses, hospitals,
palliative care structures, home care services. The project, clearly complex, needs
several successive phases for a correct implementation.

PHASE 1 Definition of the Promoting Group (PG)
In this phase is defined the promoting group of the project and, subsequently,
the group of targeted caregivers. This phase consists of three moments:

Moment 1: Searching for the PG
The PG will consist of health professionals directly connected with
caregivers. These people may be part of the health staff of different
clinics, health houses, hospitals, nursing homes, public and private
non-profit organizations, entities that are dedicated to health care. The PG
will be directly responsible for recruiting participants and monitoring the
process.

Moment 2: Organization and training of the PG
Once the PG has been identified, the project will be explained in detail and
the different roles will be defined. The fundamental principles of
salutogenesis and of Mindfulness will be presented. At this moment of Phase
1 the GP will have to: participate in a Mindfulness course to learn the
basics of full awareness (underlining the aspects of care and self-care),
and acquire the minimum theoretical and practical knowledge to follow the
project. Mindfulness exercises and full practices will be held by expert
practitioners, preferably psychotherapists.

Moment 3: Recruitment and configuration of the Caregivers Group
(CG).
The projects considers only one PG that will be in charge of recruiting the
caregivers who will be part of the project. Once the CG has been identified,
a session will be held to present and explain the project, the aims, the
Mindfulness and the fundamental principles of salutogenesis. The CG will
then begin to perform various Mindfulness practices (19) with a subsequent deepening of Samatha and
Vipassana. Subsequently we will introduce practices related to
relationships, gratitude and self-care, with Metta and Tonglen meditations.
Finally, different types of walking meditation (of the senses, of the
synupodal rhythm and of body movements and sensations) will be
introduced.

PHASE 2: Organization and planning
In this phase the caregivers’ baseline levels of sense of coherence,
perceived burden, quality of life, self-compassion and mindful attitude will be
traced. An organizational agenda will also be defined, to finally proceed to the
delimitation of the area to be mapped.

Moment 1: Test.
Compilation of questionnaires: Sense of Coherence (SOC; 20), Zarit Scale (ZS; 21) or Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS; 22), Cuestionario de Calidad de Vida
de los Cuidadores Informales (23),
Self-Compassión Scale (SCS; 24) and the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ;
25).

Moment 2: Actualizing resources and agenda.
We will specify which resources (materials, time, and physical spaces) will
be used to implement the project, together with a time schedule related to
the conclusion of the project.

Moment 3: Delimitation of the Map.
We will define the internal and external areas that will be mapped:

1) Internal or personal resources promoting health: skills, abilities,
characteristics, profiles, leisure time, passions, interests, personal
relationships, defined using Mindfulness sessions and group therapy.

2) Existing external resources promoting health: organizations and
associations, institutions, local economy, local culture, infrastructures
and physical spaces, area (of the city, of the country, ...) where they will
identify the external resources .

At this stage, the CG will continue to perform different Mindfulness
exercises specifically designed to facilitate the identification of internal
resources. To increase the participants’ familiarity with the maps,
in this phase will be introduced formal and informal dynamic exercises of
Mindfulness applied to the maps reading. At this stage, in order to allow
participants to be more aware of the external resources, specific walking
meditations will be practiced to facilitate the mapping party.

PHASE 3: Mapping party
This phase will be dedicated to the real mapping of the internal and external
resources of each participant.

Moment 1: Practice of conscious walking (Walking Meditation).
This phase will begin with the realization of the three walking meditations
directly related to the mapping party.

The walking meditations will be followed by general exercises of Samatha and
Vipassana, by relational exercises of Metta and Tonglen to strengthen the
emotional bonds and group cohesion, and by general self-care exercises.

Moment 2: Mapping party.
To help participants perform the actual mapping, several Mindfulness
exercises will be performed immediately before the start of walking
meditation, adapted according to the characteristics of the group.

Thereafter, the caregivers will be invited to go out together to the
previously identified area (Phase 2, Moment 3) together with the PG. Once
the identified area is reached, they will practice a conscious walk,
identifying the different external health assets through observation of the
context. This process will be videotaped for later analysis. The walking
meditation session will also be an opportunity for caregivers to be more
aware of some of their internal characteristics (skills, attitudes,
interests, resources). Participants will be asked to share verbally or in
writing what has emerged during the practice and they will be
videotaped.

Moment 3: Identification of Assets.
At this point, the external resources identified (actual and potential) will
be classified into six different types: individuals, associations and
organizations, institutions, local economy, local culture and physical
infrastructure and spaces (9).

After the implementation of the Mapping party, a meeting including PG and CG
will be held, to share what happened during the walking meditation, with the
visualization of the video realized and the sharing of the identified
external assets. Finally, the external assets will be inserted in the map
along with the other potential external resources that need to be improved
in order to become proper assets.

During this meeting, the personal assets will be determined, identified not
only during the walking meditation but also during the whole project through
the various exercises proposed and the experiences lived in everyday life.
These internal assets will be tracked in what we will call “Mindful
Map” (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Mindful Map

A heart-shaped illustration divided vertically into two quadrants or
“petals” of the heart. A petal refers to the self relationship
and the other petal refers to the relationship with others. Each petal of
the heart in turn is divided into three other quadrants or shelters. These
three shelters indicate the new attitudes, skills and relationships
developed during the project. At the same time, the “Mindful
Map” indicates the new objectives, interests, in the short, medium
and long term, emerged during the project. These goals are reflected in the
arteries or natural branches that leave the heart.

PHASE 4: Visibility
This phase will be centered on the diffusion and visibility of the effects that
emerged from the whole project. This role will be played by the PG with the help
of the CG.

We will use paper material with the maps of external and internal assets,
distributed to associations, institutions, shared through the municipal council
website, on local radios, in the local press, in posters, and electronic
advertising.

We will also create online contents (e-Health site) not only to increase the
visibility of the project, but also to continue to support, in an interactive
way, the working group. It is assumed that CG and PG will continue to perform
Mindfulness exercises regularly.

PHASE 5: Strengthening the relationships between the different parts of the
community
According to the results of the mapping process, the interventions needed will be
prioritized and modified according to their potential.

The map of assets created during the project will allow the health care context
to choose strategies that centralize the local strengths, in order to address
health issues appropriately, to define new actions in health policies and to
favor a service orientation towards the promotion of health.

In addition, an informal sharing session will be organized to qualitatively
evaluate the experience of the participants. Finally a final report will be
drawn up on the health of this community, which will be delivered to local
policy makers.

Also in this phase Samatha and Vipassana exercises will be practiced and specific
exercises related to breathing will be added with the aim of generating greater
mental calm, thus facilitating mental clarity, encouraging creativity and
improving decision making, not neglecting, not even at this stage, self-care
exercises. Finally, in this phase the CG will be asked to fill the same
questionnaires filled in Phase 2, Moment 1.

Results analysis
Once the project is finished, a quantitative and qualitative assessment will be
carried out using structure, process, outcomes and quality indicators. In
particular:

1) Structure: every material and organizational element necessary to guarantee the
correct execution of the project (human, physical, technical and financial
organizational resources);

2) Process: procedures, activities, methods and organization suitable for the
development of the project, best number of participants and activities that should
be fulfilled;

3) General and specific aims that have been achieved;

3) The pre-post scores in the questionnaires administered to caregivers: SOC, Zarit,
Burden and the Quality of Life.

4) The assessment of technical and organizational quality, as: effectiveness and
efficiency (objective evaluation), acceptability and satisfaction of the assisted
persons (subjective evaluation).

Conclusions
The project presented here is an innovative model to be implemented in health
policies in the context of primary care.

The main objective of this project is not to identify the internal assets only during
the mapping party, but throughout the entire project.

We are aware that Mindfulness has its limitations: it is an excellent tool to manage
a multitude of stressful situations, but it is not a tool that by itself can solve
psychopathological problems or symptoms already in progress. On the other hand,
being able to be aware of the present moment by moment, is an important challenge in
the current Western cultural approach, and represents a great space for growth. As
Jon Kabat-Zinn states: “put awareness into your life and the changes will
come by themselves” (2).

Given the lack of homogeneity in the management of health issues, the ABCD
methodology with a salutogenic orientation reinforces and emphasizes the development
of policies and activities based on the skills, abilities and resources of the less
favored people and territories (11). It is
an opportunity to promote active citizen participation and cooperation to achieve a
sufficient level of empowerment to reduce these inequalities, thus maintaining an
adequate level of health not completely influenced by social determinants.

Working with caregivers, with such a powerful tool as Mindfulness, is an opportunity
that should not be left aside because of the idiosyncrasy of Mindfulness itself. The
cross axis of this philosophy of life revolves around an indispensable pivot:
remember people to take care of themselves, even when they are taking care of
others.
