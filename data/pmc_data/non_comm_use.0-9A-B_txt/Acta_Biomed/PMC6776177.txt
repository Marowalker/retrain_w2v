Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Of the various therapeutic approaches, chemotherapy is the most widely used treatment. Among the various side effects associated with this treatment, taste alterations (TAs) have received little attention, even though they have a serious impact on the nutritional aspect and quality of life (QoL) of patients. TAs concern 75% of the patients receiving chemotherapy, and this figure is still considered to be underestimatedbeacuse could be due both to inadequate attention and to the absence of specific subjective tools able to fully evaluate TAs in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods:
A review by querying CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases about the current status of use of the CiTAS self-evaluation scale, was performed.

Results:
From critical reading of the selected reports, it can be said that until now CiTAS has not been used to a large extent for evaluating taste, even at a late stage in patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, the results and the selected reports seem to indicate hope for its wider use.

Conclusions:
In literature, CITAS scale has been used on very heterogeneous populations and not adequately studied in specific care settings, its use within controlled trials could implement its spread. Correct and subjective evaluation of TAs would allow the planning of specific and personalized interventions aimed at providing adequate nutrition to support the maintenance and/or achievement of a correct body mass index. All this could contribute significantly to a better perception of QoL in patients undergoing chemotherapy. (www.actabiomedica.it)

Introduction
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), cancer is among the leading causes of death (1-3); in 2018, 9.6 million deaths from cancer are expected (2). In particular, in Europe, there are about 4,229,662 new cases of cancer(2). Despite new therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy (4), treatments available today against cancer include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy (5). Chemotherapy is often used in the treatment of such diseases. These treatments are effective against cancer cells but also attack the physiological development of normal cells (6, 7).

The adverse effects of these therapies necessary for the treatment of cancers are now well known (5, 8, 9). The QoL of such patients is increasingly considered as a fundamental outcome of the therapeutic process(10-12). Strategies to reduce adverse events in the treatment of cancer diseases have recently been the subject of greater attention (13). Patients undergoing these treatments perceive various symptoms that may affect completion of the treatment course and their quality of life (QoL), both during and after treatment (14-17). Chemotherapy can cause adverse effects that have a negative impact on nutritional status, such as anorexia, changes in taste and smell, aversion to food, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, constipation, diarrhea and early satiety (18). Research initially focused on the gastrointestinal consequences of cancers and their treatments (19), leaving aside other aspects such as taste alterations (TAs). TAs are the most distressing side effect with a serious impact on the nutritional aspect and QoL of patients and have received little attention from healthcare professionals (5). Taste is an important sensation that serves to evaluate the nutritional content of food, support oral intake and prevent the ingestion of potentially toxic substances. Patients with loss of taste have worse outcomes than those who have not lost their sense of taste and have been able to maintain food intake and nutritional support (20). TAs affect 75% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, and are still considered to be underestimated(19), despite their impact on the QoL of patients undergoing this treatment appearing to be increasingly known (7, 21, 22). This underestimation could be due both to inadequate attention and to the absence of specific subjective tools (6) able to fully evaluate TAs in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The CiTAS scale (23) is a tool for immediate and easy use (6).

The CiTAS original version (KANO) is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 18 items evaluated on a five-point Likert-type scale and divided into three dimensions:

quantitative changes in the perception of flavours (hypogeusia and ageusia),

qualitative changes in the perception of flavours (heterogeusia, cacogeusia) and

problems related to nutrition (difficulty in eating hot or fat foods).

Using a Likert scale 1-5 (where 1 = no difficulty or absence of the disturbance and 5 = maximum difficulty or disturbance), CiTAS evaluates the 4 dimensions of gustatory disturbances: intensity of taste, discomfort, phantogeusie and parageusia, and general alterations of taste. CiTAS can help in the planning of specific nursing interventions, providing adequate nutrition to support the maintenance and/or achievement of a correct body mass index. This can contribute to a better perception of QoL and to coping better with the side effects of chemotherapy (6). Through this mini-review we wanted to investigate the state of the art about use of the CiTAS scale for the evaluation of TAs in cancer patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs.

Materials and Methods
The review process was conducted in the following steps: identification of the research problem, bibliographic research, data evaluation, data analysis and finally presentation of the summary of results. The research was conducted using the CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. The MeSH search terms included, “Chemotherapy-induced Taste Alteration Scale”, “CiTAS”, “Cancer Patients, Taste alteration”, “Taste disorder” and “Chemotherapy” were combined with each other. The formulation of search terms/keywords and research on electronic databases was performed in collaboration to ensure greater validity and reduce biases in conducting research. Our research included articles in English published between January 2008 and December 2018. The limitations used were: human population, English language, publications in the last 10 years and scientific articles. Studies regarding patients of paediatric and neonatal age and validation studies were excluded. Only studies that met the previously described bibliographic search criteria were considered and only primary studies were included. Abstracts were evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria described below in order to determine whether or not to continue search and retrieval of full texts. Naturally, the same studies present on several databases were evaluated only once. All the full texts were in turn evaluated on the basis of the general and specific inclusion/exclusion criteria below to identify those eligible for review. Bibliographic research was conducted from May 3, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Research of articles and their analysis was conducted independently by three researchers.. For selection criteria, articles from national and international scientific literature whose title and content contained at least one of the keywords or a link to them were included. Selection was made after careful reading of the abstract and the complete article (Table 1).

Results
CiTAS has been used until now to evaluate taste alterations even at a late stage in patients undergoing chemotherapy. One study investigated these alterations and radiotherapy (Table 2). In particular, the articles considered for our study are described in Table 2. The descriptive-correlational study by Antony and Pavithran (5) in India was aimed at determining taste alterations and their possible relationship with the Quality of Life of patients undergoing chemotherapy. The study was conducted on 100 patients, aged between 20 and 65, who underwent at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy treatment, through convenience sampling. The CiTAS scale was used to evaluate the taste status of participating patients. All patients enrolled had taste alteration: 10% of the severe sample, and 50% of the entire moderate sample. Such taste alterations showed a negative correlation with the Quality of Life, highlighting how an increase in taste alteration is related to a worse Quality of Life. The 2015 Sozeri study (7) aimed to determine the factors influencing taste alteration induced by chemotherapy, based on the subscales of the CiTAS instrument. Conducted on 184 patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment enrolled at the Haematology Unit of a university structure, its results showed how gender and age were variables that did not influence any CiTAS subscale. On the contrary, the most severe taste alterations were found in patients with xerostomia and a sore mouth. A study with the same objective is that of Rea et al.(24) conducted on 152 patients undergoing chemotherapy. Here, instead, females - like patients with phantoegusia and paraegusia - seem to experience this type of alteration more. The preliminary study by Simeone et al. (25), which investigates taste alterations in young and elderly patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment confirms that elderly subjects over 70 years of age have a taste alteration induced by chemotherapeutic drugs greater than any other group of patients with ages that differ from theirs. The aim of the multicentric observational study by Guillari et al. (19), conducted on 92 women recruited through convenience sampling, is to describe the qualitative taste alterations in women undergoing chemotherapy. The results show how phantogeusia and parageusia were more present than in the other CiTAS classes. Furthermore, in the sample of women considered, a reduction in appetite and an absence of salivation showed a strong negative correlation with all CiTASsubscales. The 2017 cross-sectional study by Sato et al. (26), conducted on 91 patients, evaluated the prevalence of taste alterations and the predictive factors of these taste disorders at a late stage in patients who had survived allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Taste disorders were observed in almost half of the patients investigated. The most frequent form of taste disturbances at a late stage was reduced appetite. Almost all taste disturbances were mild in their severity. The taste disturbances investigated could return to normal levels after 1 year from transplantation. Among patients more than 1 year after HCT, chronic oral GVHD was significantly associated with an increased risk of phantogeusia and parageusia, whereas that among patients less than 1 year after HCT it was not. Immunosuppressive treatment did not affect any taste disturbance in patients either more than 1 year or less than 1 year after HCT. The 2018 longitudinal study by Jin et al. (27) is characterised by the novelty of the setting of use of the CiTAS scale. The study aims to dynamically evaluate taste alteration and its correlation with weight loss in patients with cancer of the head and/or neck treated with radiotherapy incombination or not with a chemotherapy protocol or after surgery. Of the 161 patients enrolled, the complete results for 114 patients showed how taste alterations were present at the beginning of treatment, increasing halfway through the therapeutic cycle and remaining constant until the post-term follow-up of treatment. Within this time frame, all aspects of taste alteration investigated by CiTAS increased, decreasing relative to the intermediate period but with values that were higher than those of the initial period. Weight loss was recorded in all enrolled patients. The total CiTAS score, decline in basic taste, general taste alterations, discomfort, and phantogeusia and parageusia all had a significant negative effect on weight loss.

Discussion
Use of the CiTAS scale is not yet widespread as desired. To date CiTAS has been used to evaluate taste alteration even at late stages in patient undergoing chemioterapy. The QoL of patients with cancers is more influenced by chemioterapy; the QoL is considered as a fundamental outcome of the therapeutic process (10-12). Chemotherapy can cause adverse effects that have a negative impact on nutritional status, such as anorexia, changes in taste and smell, aversion to food, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, constipation, diarrhea and early satiety (18).

TAs are the most distressing side effect with a serious impact on the nutritional aspect and QoL of patients (5). Taste is an important subjective sensation that influence Body Mass Index. Patients with loss of taste have worse outcomes than those who have not lost their sense of taste and have been able to maintain food intake and nutritional support (20). TAs affect are underestimated because there is absence of specific subjective tools (6) able to fully evaluate TAs in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The CiTAS scale (23) is a tool for immediate and easy use (6).

Primary studies selected according to the inclusion criteria of this work show how this scale has been used on a very heterogeneous population (19), young and old (25)women, with different types of cancer (24). All patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments. Just the non-differentiation of the various chemotherapy treatments may represent a limitation that can be found in the current literature, just as other limitations could be the presence of comorbidity and/or other concomitant treatments that could influence TA. All the selected studies have investigated the TAs already after the first chemotherapy treatment. Only one study (7) waited three cycles of chemotherapy before proceeding with an evaluation of the TAs. However, we consider it a duty to point out the approach taken by Jin et al (27) which included a baseline assessment. Precisely because of what has been said so far, we believe that this approach is the most desirable. An early subjective assessment of taste and subsequently of its alterations may allow the implementation of specific and targeted intervention programs aimed at improving the QoL of these subjects. The selected studies show more descriptive-observational manuscripts, therefore, there are no primary studies that can be classified at the peak of scientific evidence. Longitudinal RCTs would be desirable for reinforcing the importance of this instrument. In addition to analyzing TAs in patients undergoing chemotherapy, this scale has also been used for patients undergoing another therapeutic regimen, such as radiotherapy (27). This confirms the attention of international research regarding TAs and the reliability of this scale in evaluating subjective TAs. In addition, there exist psychometric validation studies (6, 23, 28)this means that more and more professionals in the world feel the need to evaluate the TAs in order to guarantee a correct QoL of the subjects subjected to chemotherapeutic treatments. This aspect lead to hope for a future use of CiTAS in new populations and/or similar populations but with different cultural backgrounds.

Conclusions
The nurse plays an important role in evaluating the nutritional status and quality of life of cancer patients. Chemotherapy remains a fundamental therapeutic strategy for cancer diseases. The side effects of chemotherapy are well known and TAs are a distressing side effect that can significantly affect the nutrition and QoL of patients, so close attention must be paid from the start of therapy. The purpose of nursing care for patients undergoing chemotherapy is to prevent or reduce treatment-related symptoms and problems. To date, there are no guidelines for the evaluation and management of TA, yet a correct and subjective assessment of TA would allow the planning of specific and personalized actions aimed at providing adequate nutrition to support the maintenance and/or achievement of a correct body mass index. All of this can contribute in an important way to a better perception of QoL.
