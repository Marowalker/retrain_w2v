Introduction
Magnetic Resonance (MR) is the best non-invasive imaging method for evaluating the anatomical structures of the knee (1); its diagnostic accuracy, which varies according to the equipment used and the anatomical tissue studied, can be comparable to that of arthroscopy (2-6), considered the gold standard in the diagnostic evaluation of meniscal and cruciate ligaments lesions.

Most of the scientific studies aimed at assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the MR were carried out with high intensity field equipment (>1T) but even low-field studies (<0.5T) (3,7,8) have shown an overlapping diagnostic reliability concerning the pathology of meniscal fibrocartilages and cruciate ligaments.

High intensity field MR devices provide better signal/noise ratio, better contrast and better spatial resolution with faster acquisition time than low magnetic fields (8); however, considering the lower purchase and maintenance costs, the ease of installation in not too wide environments (9) and the diagnostic performance for ligaments and menisci similar to that of the high-intensity field MR (8), it would be generally desirable to use low-field equipment.

Moreover, despite the availability of high-intensity field “open” machines, low-intensity sectoral equipment is preferred by claustrophobic patients and children for whom no sedation is required (10).

To date the reliability of the information about the articular cartilage condition obtained with low intensity magnetic fields is still doubtful; in particular mild chondral lesions seem to be not easy to be detected by these low field devices (3).

Purpose
The primary aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a low-field (0.3T) sectoral MR device, compared with arthroscopy, for meniscal, cruciate ligaments and chondral knee lesions. Secondary aims were the estimation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and inter-observer concordance.

Materials and methods
We conducted a retrospective study analyzing all the knees consecutively subjected to arthroscopy at our institution between January 2014 and June 2017 and preceded by knee MR examination within 90 days from arthroscopy at our institution with 0.3 T equipment with dedicated coil (Oscan, Esaote, Genova, Italy). The MR examinations were performed with the knee in slight flexion and intra-rotation with the STIR, GRE T1, SE T1, FSE T2 acquisitions in the three planes of the space (Table 1).

TR: repetition time; TE: echo time; Etl: long echo train lenght; Gap: slice intervals; Nex: number of excitation.

Exclusion criteria concerned all the patients examined by other MR devices, to have a uniform MR evaluation; moreover patients undergone arthroscopy more than 90 days after MR and patients with history of a new trauma in the time interval between MR examination and arthroscopy were also excluded from the study to avoid possible modifications of the tissues which could vary and false the MR-Arthroscopy comparison.

All patients included in the study expressed a written consent to undergo MR examination and arthroscopy and to treat personal data.

Two independent experienced radiologists evaluated, in blind of the other radiologist and of the arthroscopic report, the MR findings of the menisci, the cruciate ligaments and the articular cartilage, classifying the lesions according respectively to Lotysch for menisci (3 degrees) (Table 2) (11), American Medical Association (AMA) for ligaments (3 degrees) (Table 3) (12), and Outerbridge for cartilage (4 degrees) (Table 4) (13); moreover, in evaluating the cartilage, the articular surfaces were divided into medial and lateral condyle, medial and lateral tibial plateau, femoral trochlea and patella.

II	linear areas of hyperintensity, no extension to the articular surface	
III	abnormal hyperintensity extends to at least one articular surface (superior or inferior), and is referred as a definite meniscal tear	
Table 3. AMA ligament injury classification

I	Mild, minor tearing of ligament fibers and no demonstrable increase in translation on examination	
II	Moderate, partial tear of the ligament without complete disruption, with a slight to moderate increased translation upon examination	
III	Severe, complete tear of the ligament, with a marked increase in translation upon examination	
Table 4. Outerbridge articular cartilage defect grading

I	Focal areas of hyperintensity with an intact surface	
II	Shallow superficial ulceration, fibrillation, or fissuring involving less than 50% of the depth of the articular surface	
III	Deep ulceration, fibrillation, fissuring, or a chondral flap involving 50% or more of the depth of the articular cartilage without exposure of subchondral bone.	
IV	Full-thickness chondral wear with exposure of subchondral bone	
Both series of radiological findings were independently compared with those of the arthroscopic report considered as gold standard and for each of the examined targets the following parameters were calculated:

Sensitivity (SS): the percentage of patients for whom the diagnosis detected by MR was confirmed by arthroscopy

Specificity (SP): the percentage of patients for whom the negative diagnosis detected by MR was confirmed by arthroscopy

Accuracy (ACC): the percentage of patients for whom the MR scan diagnosis was found to be the same at arthroscopy;

Positive Predictive Value (PPV): percentage of patients with positive MR findings also positive at arthroscopy;

Negative Predictive Value (NPV): the percentage of patients with negative MR findings confirmed as negative by arthroscopy;

Inter-observer concordance statistically calculated using Cohen’s K test.

MR findings
At MRI the first reader recognized:

194/208 meniscal lesions, misunderstanding 14 (9 of lateral meniscus and 5 of medial meniscus);

41/45 cruciate ligaments lesion, misunderstanding 4 (3 of the ACL and 1 of the PCL);

136/242 cartilage injuries, misunderstanding 106 (9 on the patella, 49 on the tibia and 48 on the femur) (Figure 2 and 3).

The second MR reader detected:

185/208 meniscal lesions, misunderstanding 23 (3 of the lateral meniscus and 20 of the medial meniscus);

37/45 injuries of the cruciate ligaments, misunderstanding 8 (7 for the ACL and 1 for the PCL);

126/242 cartilage injuries, misunderstanding 116 (7 on the patella, 62 on the tibia and 54 on the femur) (Figure 4 and 5).

MR-Arthroscopy comparison (Table 5)
Meniscal injuries revealed 90% of sensitivity, 91% specificity and a diagnostic accuracy of 93% (mean values between the two observers vs arthroscopy);

crossed ligaments lesions showed 73% sensitivity and 97% specificity with an accuracy of 96%;

for articular cartilage we obtained a mean sensitivity of 58%, 92% specificity and 85% diagnostic accuracy: in particular 82% patella, 90% tibia and 84% femur.

Inter-observer concordance resulted to be excellent for cruciate ligaments (K of Cohen’s test = 0.832), good (K = 0.768) for menisci, modest to moderate for articular cartilage (K ranging from 0.236 to 0.389) with worse concordance for tibial cartilage.

Discussion
Over the years, with the evolution of machines and study protocols, MR has been confirmed as a non-invasive and highly sensitive instrument in the evaluation of osteo-ligamentous structures, articular surfaces and peri-articular knee tissues (1).

Arthroscopy, on the other side, is a highly sensitive and specific procedure for evaluating endocapsular structures (2-5) but invasive and no more accepted as sole diagnostic instrument.

As mentioned above, high-intensity field devices (>1T) allow for spatial and contrast resolution and a signal-to-noise ratio not obtainable with low-field equipment (<0.5T), if not increasing scanning time at the expense of increasing artifacts from movement (14,15).

Here we emphasize the use of low-field equipment dedicated to the joints, cheaper and more versatile than the large and expensive high-field equipment of proven diagnostic quality (4,16-20).

Our results are in line with literature as regards the evaluation of pathological findings on menisci (2,5,14,21) and cruciate ligaments (2,5,6,21-24) with a good (93% and 96% respectively) diagnostic accuracy and a good to excellent inter-observer concordance (Table 5).

Riel et al. (5) correctly identified, using the low field MR, the 3 lesions of the PCL present in their own study, as well as Lokannavar et al. (24) correctly identified two kind of lesions in their own study. Although our results were in line with these studies about the PCL injuries, it is still difficult to draw statistical conclusions with such small size samples.

The low diagnostic accuracy associated with the low inter-observer concordance found in detecting cartilage lesions reveals a weakness in diagnosing cartilage injuries by the 0.3T MR equipment. In our experience, the major discrepancies between radiological and arthroscopic findings are referred to grade I-II chondral injuries, mostly about patella (average error 24.5%), and less (15% and 14.5% respectively) for tibia and femur (trochlear cartilage) (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Visual representation of percentages of diagnostic errors for cartilage divided in degree I or degrees II-III-IV (according to the Outerbridge classification)

Scarcity of studies on articular surface evaluation by low-field MR makes it difficult to compare our data with literature. In particular Lee et al. (3) comparing their chondral lesions findings between low-field MRI and arthroscopy, obtained 8% of sensitivity and 94% of specificity, while Riel et al. (5) evaluating only grade III chondral lesions and comparing them with arthroscopy obtained 72% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity.

Best results in the field of chondral lesions are obtained with machines capable of developing more intense fields (> 1T); especially, the recent use of 3T equipment has allowed good diagnostic reliability also with 76% of sensitivity and 95% of specificity (16,18,19).

Conclusions
The present study confirms the reliability of the MR examination performed by low-field equipment for meniscal and ligamentous lesions, while demonstrates the limitations of the tool in detecting mild chondral lesions. Especially, the diagnostic accuracy of the latter is positively affected by the increase of the magnetic field of the latest MR equipment; however the low availability of the same and the highest cost of purchase and management makes their use not convenient except in selected cases.
