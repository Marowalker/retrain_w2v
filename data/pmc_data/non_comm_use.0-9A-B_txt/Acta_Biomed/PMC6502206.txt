Background and aim of the work
Gastroenterological diseases are common in general practice, approximately 10% of
consultations in general practice in the UK are for gastrointestinal symptoms or
problems (1). These disorders are also a
source of morbidity, mortality, and cost. In 2015, in the United States the annual
health care expenditures for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases totaled $ 135.9 billion,
with 11.0 million colonoscopies and 6.1 million upper endoscopies performed in the
same year; the mortality is also huge with 144.300 GI cancer deaths and 97.700
deaths from non-malignant diseases (2). In
Italy the situation is specular: GI diseases are the 5th cause of death
in men and the 7th in women, and with 1 million hospitalizations a year
they represent the first or second cause of hospitalization in the last 10 years
(3). The aim of this narrative review is
to evaluate the current literature on the existing role of general practitioners
(GPs) in the diagnosis and management of some of the principal GI disorders in order
to point out the importance of early diagnosis and correct managements in reduce
morbidity, mortality and costs.

Methods
Articles reviewed were found through literature searches on PubMed and Google Scholar
from keywords related with primary care and specific GI diseases.

Upper gastrointestinal disorders
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
GERD is a highly prevalent condition defined as symptoms or complications
resulting from the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, or beyond into
the oral cavity or lung. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the prevalence
of GERD in the Western world is 10%–20%, with a lower prevalence in Asia
(4). The disease represents also the
fourth most common chronic condition seen in primary care practice (5) (Fig.
1). Because of its prevalence in general population GPs play a
crucial role in its management, but the diagnosis is not as easy as it seems,
typical symptoms of GERD are heartburn and regurgitation, however, these
symptoms are not as sensitive as most believe and patients with GERD may present
with a broad range of symptoms as dyspepsia or extraesophageal manifestations
(such as chronic cough and asthma). Caution is needed for patients with chest
pain: a cardiac cause should be excluded before starting a GI evaluation.
Moreover, many patients (70%) with typical GERD symptoms do not have endoscopic
erosive disease (non-erosive reflux disease NERD), suggesting that endoscopy is
of limited value in guiding disease management (6). This pan-European study showed that across countries, 28-47% of
patients reported a significant GERD symptom load at initial consultation with a
GP, thereafter, 30-100% of patients were prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
(PPI), but a significant GERD symptom load was still experienced by 15-30% at
follow-up. In most of patients (65-88%), no diagnostic procedures were performed
between initial consultation and follow-up. Those findings indicate that current
management of primary care patients with GERD is far from optimal, and accounts
for a marked burden on patients and healthcare systems (7). Several studies have demonstrated that there is often
poor agreement between patients and physicians in their assessment of GERD
symptom severity, and physicians tend to underestimate symptom severity and the
impact on health-related quality of life, which is an essential component of
providing proper medical care, improvement in clinician-patient communication is
suggested in order to bridge this gap (8, 9).

Figure 1 Esophageal cancer
The incidence of esophageal cancer (EC) is increasing: the reason for this major
epidemiological shift is an increase in GERD and its principal complication,
Barrett’s esophagus, the only known precursor lesion for EC (10). The role of H. pylori eradication in
this increase is yet uncertain. While the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma
of the esophagus has recently been stable or declined in Western societies, the
incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has risen more rapidly than that of any
other cancer in many countries since the 1970s. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is
associated with gastro-esophageal reflux and obesity, whereas squamous cell
carcinoma is associated with use of tobacco and alcohol. Overall, the prognosis
for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer is poor, but those whose tumors
are detected at an early stage have a good chance of survival (11). Hence the importance of effective
prevention and early diagnosis but evidence shows that diagnosis of EC is often
delayed, and the interval between symptom onset and diagnosis ranges from
1.2–11.7 months (12).
Implications for primary care include advising patients that persistent
heartburn is not a trivial complaint, especially if unresponsive to lifestyle
changes and over-the-counter medication, and encouraging consultation. GPs will
need to consider referring for endoscopy early, rather than the current practice
of treating blindly with acid suppression (13).

Helicobacter pylori, dyspepsia, and “the gastric precancerous
cascade”
H. pylori is a common bacterium, that colonizes human stomach, discovered in 1983
by Warren and Marshall (14). This
global systematic review shows that in 2015, approximately 4.4 billion
individuals worldwide were estimated to be positive for H. pylori with a wide
variation in the prevalence of H. pylori between regions and countries (15). H. pylori has been established as a
major cause of chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, peptic ulcer, dyspepsia and
gastric cancer. IARC classified H. pylori as a group 1 carcinogen in 1994, and
hence the most recent guidelines suggest a test-and-threat strategy in patients
with dyspeptic symptoms in order to reduce the incidence of gastric cancer
(16-18). Correa et al demonstrated the role of H. pylori as
initiator of the “gastric precancerous cascade” consisting of the
following steps: normal gastric mucosa → non-atrophic gastritis (NAG)
→ multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) without intestinal metaplasia
→ intestinal metaplasia of the small intestine type → intestinal
metaplasia of the colonic type → low-grade non-invasive neoplasia
→ high-grade non-invasive neoplasia → invasive adenocarcinoma
(19). GPs are at the forefront of
H. pylori management but overall adherence to guidelines seems low, for example
in this Israeli study only 43.6% of GPs routinely confirm eradication with a
noninvasive test, in accordance with guidelines. Of the total, 41.1% respondents
treat all patients found to harbor H. pylori infection and 58.1% only treat
symptomatic patients. The etiological link between H. pylori and gastric cancer
was believed to be “definite” by 45.0% of GPs; only 30.9%
respondents “consistently” or “usually” screen
first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients and only 14.1% respondents
“consistently” or “usually” screen before initiating
long-term therapy with NSAIDs (20).
Things aren’t much different in other part of the word (21-25). A 2009 study by Spiegel et al found that there was a
significant difference in guideline adherence regarding dyspepsia between
gastroenterologists and GPs (74% versus 57%, respectively) (26).

Figure 2. Gastric cancer
Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy in the world, and the
third leading cause of cancer death in both sexes worldwide (27). Early diagnosis is the only way to
reduce the mortality but at present time there isn’t a consensus on GC
screening program; although most recent guidelines suggest that validated
serological tests for H pylori and markers of atrophy (i.e. pepsinogens and
gastin-17) are the best available non-invasive tests to identify subjects at
high risk of gastric cancer (28). H.
pylori serology combined with serum pepsinogen I/II ratio may constitute a
non-invasive method to detect premalignant conditions (29, 30). A
significant proportion of patients with early GC experience only nonspecific
dyspeptic symptoms; because dyspepsia is very common in the general population,
the difficulty for GPs is in deciding which patients should be referred early
for investigation. In a study from Italy authors concluded that a panel composed
of PGI, PGII, G-17 and IgG-Hp could be used as a first approach in the
‘test and scope’ and/or ‘test and treat’ strategy in
the primary care management of dyspeptic patients (31). Even an alarm symptom such as the onset of iron
deficiency anemia in post-menopausal women and men seem managed sub optimally by
GPs: in this study, in UK, it was noticed that only 47% of 431 patients
presenting to their general practitioner with an iron-deficient anemia were
adequately managed and 39% of patients who were otherwise fit for investigation
had no tests at all. It is worth noticing that only 29 of the 41 GI cancers (22
lower, seven upper) were found as a result of satisfactory GI investigations
(32). A similar study from
Netherlands showed that only 31% of male and postmenopausal female patients with
iron deficiency anemia received some form of endoscopic evaluation (33).

Lower gastrointestinal disorders
Inflammatory bowel disease
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a global healthcare problem with a sustained
increasing incidence. It includes two major forms, Crohn’s disease (CD)
and ulcerative colitis (UC); CD can cause transmural inflammation and affect any
part of the gastrointestinal tract (most commonly, the terminal ileum or the
perianal region) in a non-continuous type and is frequently associated with
complications such as abscesses, fistulas and strictures. In contrast, UC is
typified by mucosal inflammation and limited to the colon. Although the etiology
of IBD remains largely unknown, recent research indicated that the
individual’s genetic susceptibility, external environment, intestinal
microbial flora and immune responses are all involved and functionally
integrated in the pathogenesis of IBD (34). IBD affects primarily young adults for the rest of their life,
resulting in a huge impact on health services. These patients, indeed, require
life-lasting medical care as well as clinical and laboratory investigation
(35). A significant part of these
services refers to primary care, in which the GP plays a key role, especially
regarding early diagnosis and monitoring the compliance of patient to treatment,
in this challenge they are helped by fecal calprotectin (FC)with the emerging
evidence that it is a useful non-invasive marker of mucosal healing and
short-term clinical outcome in patients with IBD (36). Unfortunately, the literature on the role of GPs in
IBD management suggests a poor knowledge of the disease: in Australia 37% of the
GPs reported being generally “uncomfortable” with IBD management.
Specifically, they were only somewhat comfortable in providing/using maintenance
therapy, steroid therapy or unspecified therapy for an acute flare, but they
were uncomfortable with the use of immunomodulators and biologicals (71 and 91%,
respectively) (37). However, not all
the fault seems to be of GPs as shown by Bezzio et al: in this study respondents
indeed, declare numerous unmet needs in managing IBD patients as increasing
bureaucracy, lack of extra-gastroenterological IBD expertise, lack of diagnostic
techniques and budget limitations. About professional updating they indicated
that helpful topics are practical medicine, managing difficult patients, and
guidelines. The most desired modality for updating is residential courses on
clinical practice (38).

Irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction that
affects around 11.2% of the population globally with higher prevalence in young
women (39). Guidelines emphasize that
IBS is not a diagnosis of exclusion, and encourage clinicians to make a positive
diagnosis using the Rome criteria alone, however most community providers
believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Spiegel et al showed that experts were
less likely than GPs to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8% vs. 72%,
respectively). Experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67%
vs. 38%), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1), and to expend less money on
testing (US$297 vs. $658). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of
exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (40). Available data show that IBS
criteria are largely unknown and are poorly validated in general practice where
most patients are treated (41, 42).

Diverticulosis and diverticular disease
Diverticulosis of the colon is the most frequent anatomical colonic alteration,
frequently detected during colonoscopy. It is a structural alteration of the
colonic wall characterized by the presence of herniation of the colonic mucosa
and sub-mucosa though muscle layer, called “diverticula”. The real
prevalence of diverticulosis is unknown. In Europe, it is largely age-dependent
and is uncommon (prevalence of 5%) in those under the age of 40 years,
increasing up to 65% in those aged 65 years or more. Diverticulosis is the
presence of colonic diverticula; diverticular disease (DD) instead is defined as
clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis, that could be
uncomplicated (symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)) or
complicated (diverticulitis) (43).
According to Ubaldi et al DD is becoming a leading chronic condition in terms of
costs and burden for the health service. The management of DD greatly relies on
GPs who must approach patients also in terms of diet, lifestyle and prevention
of complications (44). In Italy the
economic burden of patients suffering from acute episodes of diverticulitis is
estimated at €63.5 million a year (45). The current literature data and current guidelines are quite
concordant in advising CT colonography when the colon must be investigated by
radiology (46), and fecal calprotectin
(FC) as a useful tool in the differential diagnosis between SUDD and IBS, as
well in assessing response to therapy in DD (47) and diverticulitis recurrence (48). There is no evidence that pharmacological treatment is useful
in asymptomatic diverticulosis and there is no rationale to avoid in the diet
the consumption of nut, corn and popcorn to prevent diverticular complications.
Fiber supplementation alone provides controversial results in terms of symptoms
relief and there is insufficient evidence that probiotics are effective in
reducing symptoms (49). Despite these
indications De Bastiani et al found that a high-fiber diet was widely prescribed
in diverticulosis (44%) by GPs together with advice to avoid seeds (30%).
Rifaximin (26%) and probiotics (25%) were the most frequent prescribed drugs in
this population. 19% of them use double-contrast barium enema to pose diagnosis
of SUDD instead of colonoscopy. Finally, only 14% of GPs prescribe fecal
calprotectin in the follow-up of the patients with SUDD or acute diverticulitis
(AD). Authors concluded that the current management of diverticulosis and DD in
primary care still conflicts with the literature and more recent guidelines
(50).

Colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout
the world. It accounts for over 9% of all cancer incidence. It is the third most
common cancer worldwide and the fourth most common cause of death. Worldwide
mortality attributable to CRC is approximately half that of the incidence.
Western diet, obesity, sedentary life, cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol
consumption, IBD, and family history of CRC are all risk factors for the
development of this neoplasm (51). The
detection and subsequent removal of precursor lesions detected during screening
and the detection of CRC at an earlier, more favorable stage have been shown to
significantly reduce incidence and mortality. For these reasons, most recent
guidelines recommend starting screening for CRC at age 45 years and continuing
it up to age 75 years (52). GPs are at
the hearth of CRC screening program but unfortunately, it remains underused:
only 77.5% of physicians report use of the US national screening guidelines and
only 51.7% use recommendations consistent with the guidelines (53). GPs reported insufficient training,
and some doubted the relevance of screening. They expressed concerns in terms of
the time available for the test during the consultation and they, also, reported
practical and administrative obstacles. Other barriers to CRC screening
evidenced by the GPs included the difficulties in convincing patients,
especially those not experiencing signs and symptoms (54). In this study Stroud et al demonstrate that a
protocol adopted by primary care staff based on simple tools such as chart
stickers, to draw attention to patients requiring screening, generation of
referral forms that were numbered for follow-up and faxed to the
gastroenterologists, and patient educational material on colorectal cancer
screening, is very effective in increase adherence to the screening program
(from the baseline of 47% in year 2001 to 86% in year 2002) (55).

Conclusions
The role of GPs is crucial in the diagnosis and management of gastroenterological
diseases and can positively influence the economic burden of them. However, the
literature review shows a lack of knowledge and a poor adherence to guidelines, for
these reasons continuing educational courses are mandatory for primary care. Authors
also hope for greater collaboration between specialists and GPs, and to use more
time to establish a stronger doctor-patient relationship in order to increase
adherence to screening programs and cares. The communication time should be
considered as a cure time.
