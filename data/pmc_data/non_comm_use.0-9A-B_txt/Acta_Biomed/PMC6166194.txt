Dear Readers,

With this 1st 2017 issue, I am very pleased to announce some major innovations regarding Acta Biomedica (Acta Biomed).

The first one concerns the periodicity: annual issues will increase from three to four, one issue every three months. This historical event is due to the high number of submissions received in recent years, and to the editorial committee effort to shorten times of publication.

As a second innovative element, our journal has planned to open four Update Sections dedicated to: Adolescence Medicine, Health systems research, Pediatric endocrinology and Emergency Medicine. Each section will be coordinated by an experienced Guest Editor, and will include Reviews, Original articles and Case reports. An experimental section, called “Briefings on”, will also be available for short papers/reports in order to encourage the publication of manuscripts focusing on topics of national interest and impact. For this section only, contributions in Italian (with English summary) will be welcome.

The third news is that Acta Biomedica with this issue becomes the official journal of the University Centre on Health Systems’ Organization, Quality and Sustainability, a research and training centre jointly supported by University of Parma, Parma University Hospital (Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria) and Local Health Authority (AUSL).

Last news: starting this current issue all articles published on ActaBiomed will have a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), located at the top of the HTML version of the article. A DOI is an unique alphanumeric identifier applied to a scientific paper, governed by the International DOI Foundation. Unlike a conventional Web address, or URL, a DOI specifies not only the location of an online paper, but rather its content. A DOI is thus a “persistent” identifier, and remains associated with the paper irrespective of changes in the object’s Web address.

All these news will provide added value to our readers, and confirm our attempt to continue to innovate our historical journal which will continue to have its own connotation of a generalist journal, but with insights on some specialist topics as suggested by the readers.

The present issue gives us the opportunity also to thank the Society of Medicine and Natural Sciences of Parma and Centre on Health Systems’ Organization, Quality and Sustainability for allowing us to lead this effort, to thank our reviewers for their tireless collaboration, and finally to thank the readers for their valuable suggestions.
