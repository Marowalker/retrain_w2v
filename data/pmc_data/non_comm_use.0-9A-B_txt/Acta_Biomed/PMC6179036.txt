==== Body
Haemoglobinopathies including the thalassemias and sickle cell disease are known to be prevalent inherited disorders in most Arab countries with varying prevalence rates and molecular characterization. Among Qataris, sickle cell disease (around 550 Qatari patients) is more prevalent than β-thalassaemia major (around 150 Qatari patients). Most of the cases are distributed in the Northern Province and in Doha, the capital of Qatar.

Patients with β-thalassaemia major and sickle cell disease present different clinical features and severity depending on the genetic type. Symptoms start early in infancy leading to relevant complications and organ dysfunctions.

β-thalassaemia major and sickle cell disease patients are treated comprehensively in Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) where the Pediatric Department takes care of these patients up to the age of 14 years. After the age of 14 years patients are treated in the National Centre for Cancer Care and Research in the Hematology Sections.

Today, due to remarkable improvement of medical care and to a better understanding of pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and prevention of endocrine complications many subjects with thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, successfully survive into adult life.

This supplement of Acta Biomedica focuses on some recent concepts that are important for the physicians taking care of subjects with growth disorders and endocrinopathies in Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Anemia.

We wish to express our sincere thanks to the Guest Editors: Prof. Ashraf T Soliman and Dr. Mohamed A Yassin for choosing Acta Biomedica to publish the “Multidisciplinary Care of Haemoglobinopathies in Qatar”.

Authors of the present issue are member of International Network of Clinicians for Endocrinopathies in Thalassemia and Adolescence Medicine (ICET-A) and experts in the fields of adolescent medicine, endocrinology and haemoglobinopathies.

We hope this supplement will be useful for all those who are taking care of subjects with haemoglobinopathies during the crucial period of adolescence and young adult age.
