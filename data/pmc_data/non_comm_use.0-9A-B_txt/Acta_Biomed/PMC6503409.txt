Dear Members,

it is with great satisfaction that I introduce the volume Acta Biomedica Supplement 1-2019 - Advances in Orthopaedics, Traumatology and Rehabilitation - SERTOT. The vitality of a Scientific Society is also assessed by its ability to regularly produce publications.

For this reason, the journal will be published in two annual issues, one dedicated to scientific papers on different orthopaedics and traumatology topics and another with unique themes.

SERTOT has always supported its own magazine, even in the most difficult moments, with qualified contributions, which in this circumstance have arrived particularly numerous, confirming how its Members and not only, while publishing in magazines of greater prestige, do not give up to scientifiwcally feed our Society and claim its future continuity.

A special thanks ... for the personal commitment and passion dedicated to the magazine.

Sincerely

Enrico Vaienti
