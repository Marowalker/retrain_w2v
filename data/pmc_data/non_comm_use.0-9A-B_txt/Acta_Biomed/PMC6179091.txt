The incidence of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents in Qatar is considerably high compared to many European countries, and has increased from 28.34 per 100,000 in 2012 to 33.2 in 2015 (95% CI of 31.2-40.0), being the 4th highest rate among 89 countries, according to the data published in 2011 by the of International Diabetes Federation’s Diabetes Atlas, to the incidence rate reported between 2006-2011 (23.15/100,000).

Furthermore, before 2008 there were not registered cases of Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents living in Qatar, but thereafter the incidence passed through 1.16 per 100,000 in 2012 to 2.72 per 100,000 in 2016. The high prevalence of obesity and overweight has been found to be strongly correlated with metabolic syndrome and was identified as a potential risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in later life. About 90% of the diabetic children and adolescents treated at Hamad General Hospital (HGH) of Doha have Type 1 diabetes.

From January 2007, the Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit of HGH has dedicated a multidisciplinary team that includes pediatric diabetologists, diabetes educators, dietitians, child psychologists and social workers who all work together with families to ensure that children with diabetes receive the best possible care. The Center follows more than 1200 diabetic children, 150 of them are on insulin pump therapy and many of them are on continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The team published many articles in the field of using CGMS in the early diagnosis of dysglycemia and in high risk groups including thalassemia, obesity, cystic fibrosis, and patients on steroid therapy (nephrotic patients).

The present supplement reports five original papers covering the epidemiology of Type 1 and 2 diabetes, the different forms of dysglycemia during pregnancy and the consequences on maternal and fetal outcomes in treated women, the familial and non-familial cases of Type1 diabetes mellitus, and the association with other autoimmune disorders. Essentially, the papers provide a comprehensive view of public health, medical aspects, and consequences of diabetes in children and adolescents living in Qatar.

The collaboration of Pediatric and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic of Quisisana Hospital (Ferrara) with Prof Ashraf T Soliman and his team started in 2011. The first publication covered the “Highlights from the First Thalassaemia Forum on Growth and Endocrine Complications in Thalassemia Doha, (October 2-3, 2011)”. Since than, 62 scientific papers have been published in international and indexed journals. Some pilot studies have opened new horizons in different fields of medicine.

I am really fully grateful and honored for the collaboration developed with the Endocrine and Diabetes Pediatric Team of HGH in Doha, and specially with a great and special friend, scientist and researcher, such as Prof. Ashraf T Soliman.

A deepest thanks and appreciation to Prof. Maurizio Vanelli, Editor in Chief of Acta Biomedica, official jounal of the Society of Medicine and Natural Sciences of Parma, and to Dr. Anna Scotti, Medical Publisher of Mattioli 1885, for having accepted my request to publish in a supplement of Acta Biomedica the experience of eminent Colleagues in the field of diabetes in children and adolescents.

I also recommend this supplement of Acta Biomedica as an excellent reading for postgraduate students and undergraduate students willing to broaden their knowledge in this field.
