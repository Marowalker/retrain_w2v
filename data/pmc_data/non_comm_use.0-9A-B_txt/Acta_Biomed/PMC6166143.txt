To Our Readers,

In the last 20 years there has been a general tendency for pediatricians, internists, and general practitioners to include adolescents in their medical practices, because of rapid advances in the biological and behavioral sciences. Adolescence is the time between the beginning of sexual maturation (puberty) and adulthood. It is a time of psychological maturation, which a person becomes “adult-like” in behavior. Adolescence is roughly considered to be the period between 10 and 18 years of age. The adolescent experiences not only physical growth but also emotional, psychological, social and mental change. Providing health care for adolescents involves a variety of medical, social and legal knowledge, and close working relationships must be established within the adolescent’s network to establish an effective care system. Clinicians who are taking care of adolescents have unique opportunities to make a difference in their health and their lives by being creative, flexible and open in the care provided.

Starting from 2017, Acta Biomedica will offer to the Readers an update section on adolescent heath care with the hope that this section will be of interest to those working in front line primary care, and who would like to develop their knowledge, skills and practice capabilities. The Guest Editor of this section is Vincenzo de Sanctis, who has been President of the Italian Society for Adolescent Medicine (SIMA) and at present is Coordinator of ICET-A (International Network on Growth and Endocrine Complications in Thalassemia and Adolescent Medicine).

We hope that you will enjoy this section and invite you to contribute from your own experience and research in future issues.

Sincerely Yours
