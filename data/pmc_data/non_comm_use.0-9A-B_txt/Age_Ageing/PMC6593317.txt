In the original version of the above paper there was an error in Table 3, which shows the recommended cut-off points for ASM/height2 in women. The cut-off point was given as <6.0 kg/m2, but the correct value is <5.5 kg/m2. This has now been corrected online.

The authors wish to apologise for this error.
