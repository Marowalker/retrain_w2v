to 1967, although there have been no cases reported in humans in the past 40
years. A vaccination program was introduced in Japan in the 1960s. Older
Japanese donors could have been naturally infected with the H2N2 virus or
vaccinated in the early 1960s. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reflects
the epidemiological status of the donating population in a given time period.
Here, the possible viral neutralizing (VN) activities of IVIG against the H2N2
virus were examined. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and VN activities of IVIG
lots manufactured from 1993 to 2010 in Japan and the United States were
evaluated against H2N2 viruses. High HI and VN activities against H2N2 viruses
were found in all the IVIG lots investigated. HI titers were 32–64
against the isolate in 1957 and 64–128 against the isolates in 1965. VN
titers were 80–320 against the isolate in 1957 and 1280–5120
against the isolates in 1965. Both the HI and VN titers were higher against the
isolate in 1965 than in 1957. Thus, antibody titers of IVIG against influenza
viruses are well correlated with the history of infection and the vaccine
program in Japan. Therefore, evaluation of antibody titers provides valuable
information about IVIGs, which could be used for immune stimulation when a new
influenza virus emerges in the human population.

Introduction
The highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus has spread among wild birds
worldwide. As of April 2012, there have been 602 cases of human infections, with an
extremely high mortality rate of about 59%.1 Therefore, there are public health concerns
regarding the possible global emergence of an H5N1 pandemic virus. However, a
swine-origin pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus suddenly emerged in 2009. This novel
virus spread among human populations within a short period of time because of the
low level of immune responses against the virus, especially among young people.
Thus, a pandemic influenza virus may be transmitted to humans because of limited
immune responses against the virus in humans. The H2N2 virus could be considered one
such virus, because it was prevalent in humans between 1957 and 1967, and a
vaccination program was introduced in Japan in the 1960s.2 However, although H2N2 continues to circulate among
birds and pigs, this virus has not infected humans for the last several
decades.3 Based on the above
background, it might be worthwhile examining the neutralizing activity of human
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) against the H2N2 virus.

Generally, IVIGs are manufactured in individual lots with serum donations from over
10,000 healthy donors. Therefore, IVIG contains various antibodies against numerous
human pathogens including seasonal influenza viruses. In fact, not only current
(manufactured in 2008) but also previous (manufactured in 1999) IVIGs contain
antibodies with significant neutralizing titers against seasonal and pandemic 2009
influenza viruses.4 The antibodies
comprising IVIG therefore reflect the epidemiological status of the donating
population, in a particular time period and geographical area.

In this study, IVIG lots manufactured from 1993 to 2010 were evaluated for
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralizing (VN) activities against the
H2N2 virus.

Material and methods
Clinical isolates of H2N2 (A/Okuda/1957, A/Izumi/5/1965, A/Kaizuka/2/1965), IVIGs
manufactured from 1993 to 2010 from healthy donors in Japan (currently Kenketsu
Venoglobulin®-IH; Benesis Corporation, Osaka, Japan), and
IVIGs manufactured in 1993 and 1999 from healthy donors in the United States were
used in this study (Table 1).

The viruses were propagated in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or in
the allantoic cavity of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The culture media and
allantoic fluids were stored at −80°C prior to use. Viral
infectivity (FFU/mL) was titrated in MDCK cells using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase
(PAP) staining technique.5 The HI
test using 0.7% guinea pig erythrocytes was carried out as described
previously.5 HI titers are
expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the IVIG preparation showing
inhibition. The VN test was also carried out as described previously.5 Briefly, each IVIG was serially
diluted two-fold with serum-free minimal essential medium. The IVIG dilutions (30
μL of each) were mixed with 100 FFU (30 μL) of virus. After
incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C, the mixture (30 μL) was applied
to MDCK cells in a 96-well microplate. After incubation for 16 hours, the cells were
fixed with ethanol and stained using PAP technique. The results are expressed as the
reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% neutralization
(VN50).

Results
As summarized in Table 1, the titers
were significant against all three isolates of H2N2: HI titers of 32–64 and
VN50 titers of 80–320 against Okuda/1957, HI titers of
64–128 and VN50 titers of 1280–5120 against Izumi/5/1965,
and HI titers of 64–128 and VN50 titers of 1280–2560
against Kaizuka/2/1965. Both the HI and VN50 titers were higher against
the isolate in 1965 than in 1957 (Table
1). There were no apparent differences in the HI and VN50
titers against H2N2 virus isolates among the IVIG products prepared in the United
States and Japan in different years.

Discussion
Currently, most of the donor population has not been exposed to the H2N2 virus. IVIG
is manufactured from pooled plasma. In a previous study, HI and VN activities
against seasonal influenza H1N1 and H1N1-pdm2009 were examined in IVIG lots
manufactured from 1999 to 2008. The IVIGs indicated high and stable HI and VN
activity against H1N1. It was taken into account that the donor population may have
been immunized through native infections and/or vaccine programs. Interestingly, the
IVIGs also showed low but significant HI and VN activities against H1N1-pdm2009
despite most of the donor population never having been exposed to swine H1N1 or the
Spanish flu.4

In this study, HI and VN activities against the H2N2 virus, which has not been
included in vaccine programs for the past 45 years, were measured in IVIGs
manufactured from 1993 to 2010 in Japan. Both the HI and VN50 titers were
higher against H2N2 isolates in 1965 than in 1957. It has been reported that people
under the age of 50 years have little or no immunity to H2N2 and that people older
than 50 years who have been exposed to the virus show a higher rate of
resistance.6 Therefore, older
Japanese donors could have been naturally infected with the H2N2 virus or vaccinated
in the early 1960s. Consequently, antibody titers against the H2N2 virus in the
general population will decrease in the future, which could lead to an H2N2
pandemic. It is not clear why such differences of HI and VN activities of IVIG
preparations were observed between the United States and Japan. One possible
explanation may be derived from the difference in environmental factors and
population for blood donation between the two countries.

Conclusion
The results suggest that the antibody titers against influenza viruses in IVIGs
correlate with the history of infection and with vaccination programs. Therefore,
the evaluation of antibody titers provides valuable information about IVIGs, which
could be used for immune stimulation when a new influenza virus emerges in the human
population.
