                    provided the original work is properly cited.Vandetanib (ZD6474) is an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple intracellular
                    receptor kinases, including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
                    (VEGFR) -2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Both VEGFR and EGFR
                    pathways have emerged as instrumental in the growth and metastasis of multiple
                    malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indeed, inhibitors
                    of each pathway have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for
                    use in advanced NSCLC. As there is considerable cross talk between these
                    pathways, dual inhibition with such agents has become an attractive strategy,
                    with encouraging Phase II clinical trial data to date. The convenience of one
                    oral agent targeting both pathways is clear, and clinical trials have
                    established the maximum tolerated daily dose of vandetanib, with data from
                    randomized Phase III trials emerging. This report will review completed and
                    ongoing NSCLC clinical trials evaluating vandetanib, and speculate on the future
                    of this agent in NSCLC.

Introduction
Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide,
                accounting for over one million deaths annually.1 The majority of patients present with metastatic
                disease, with a median survival of six months.2 Approximately 85% of lung cancers are
                classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which can be further subdivided in
                adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma histology.
                Chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment in advanced NSCLC; however, a
                plateau of effectiveness with such therapy has been reached. Molecularly targeted
                agents have further improved outcome over the last decade, and several additional
                targeted agents are being developed.

To date, three targeted agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug
                Administration (FDA) in advanced NSCLC. The first to receive FDA approval was
                gefitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
                tyrosine kinase, a transmembrane receptor whose activation leads to intracellular
                signaling involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Gefitinib was later
                restricted to use only in those who were previously benefiting, as a Phase III trial
                comparing gefitinib to best supportive care did not ultimately find a survival
                    advantage.3 The second drug to
                be granted approval was erlotinib, another small molecule inhibitor of the EGFR
                tyrosine kinase, which is currently indicated as second or third line therapy in
                patients with advanced NSCLC. The last FDA-approved agent is bevacizumab, a
                humanized monoclonal antibody to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a
                key mediator of angiogenesis required for growth and metastasis of cancer. A trial
                conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) found that the addition
                of bevacizumab to first line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel led to
                improved response and survival, with a landmark median survival of one year.4 Cetuximab is another promising
                monoclonal antibody which targets the extracellular ligand binding domain of EGFR,
                and a recent Phase III study found a modest improvement in survival when this agent
                was combined with cisplatin and vinorelbine in patients with chemonaive advanced
                    NSCLC.5 The US FDA is currently
                considering approval of this drug.

Clearly, the EGFR and VEGF pathways have been clinically validated as important
                targets in the treatment of NSCLC. Preclinical studies further suggest that combined
                inhibition of both pathways may lead to synergistic effects on cancer cell growth,
                survival and metastases.6–8 The
                rationale for dual inhibition comes from our increased understanding of the
                redundancy of these pathways and their interconnectedness.

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) Pathway
Three transmembrane receptors mediate the angiogenic and lymphogenic effects of
                    VEGF; VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), -2 (KDR), and -3 (Flt-4).9 Of these, VEGFR-2 is believed to play the
                    primary role in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, survival and
                    induction of vascular permeability characteristic of neo-vascularization
                    required for tumor growth and metastasis.10,11 VEGFR-2 is activated by binding of VEGF elaborated by tumor cells,
                    which leads to receptor dimerization and intracellular signaling initiated by
                    the VEGFR tyrosine kinase.11,12 This
                    ultimately results in the production of tumor vasculature that is highly
                    permeable, dilated and tortuous, with increased tumor interstitial pressure that
                    may impede delivery of cytotoxic agents.13 The resultant increasingly hypoxic
                    microenvironment in turn upregulates expression of VEGF contributing to further
                    neo-vascularization.

EGFR Pathway
Like the VEGFR, the EGFR is activated by ligand (ie, EGF, TGF-α)
                    binding leading to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of its
                    intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This kinase in turn phosphorylates other
                    proteins, initiating a cascade of signaling events responsible for cell
                    proliferation, cell survival, metastasis and angiogenesis.14 EGFR is overexpressed in several solid tumors,
                    including NSCLC.15 Activating
                    mutations in the EGFR gene have additionally been identified that lead to
                    constitutive activity of the intracellular tyrosine kinase and predict for high
                    response rates to the small molecule EGFR inhibitors, erlotinib and
                        gefitinib.16–19
                    Although only approximately 10%–15% of
                    NSCLCs harbor EGFR mutations, it is estimated that up to 50% of
                    lifelong nonsmokers with NSCLC have EGFR mutant tumors.20 The reliance of these mutant tumors on the
                    EGFR pathway has led to the term oncogene addiction.

Crosstalk between VEGFR and EGFR Pathways
Both in vitro and in vivo data have established
                    that activation of EGFR by its ligands can lead to increased VEGFR expression
                    and neovascularization in cancer models.21,22 Indeed, both small molecule inhibitors and antibodies to EGFR (and
                    downstream signaling mediators) have resulted in decreased VEGF expression and
                    cell death in cancer cell lines and animal models.23–25 VEGF over expression may also mediate
                    resistance to EGFR antagonists, with preclinical data supporting efforts to
                    overcome acquired resistance with the addition of a VEGF inhibitor, and delaying
                    emergence of resistance with upfront dual inhibition.26 Combining bevacizumab and erlotinib in the
                    clinic is a particularly appealing strategy, considering good tolerance of each
                    agent alone, with lack of overlapping toxicities. This regimen has been well
                    tolerated in a Phase II NSCLC clinical trial that showed promising activity, and
                    the final results of two Phase III trials are awaited.27–29

Vandetanib (ZD6474, Zactima™; AstraZeneca)
                    (N-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-[(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methoxy]
                    quinazolin-4-amine)
Vandetanib is an oral anilinquinazoline that competes with ATP binding in the
                    catalytic domain of several tyrosine kinases.30 Recombinant enzyme assays haves shown it to be
                    a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2 (50% inhibitory concentration
                        [IC50] of 40 nM), with additional
                    activity against VEGFR-3 (IC50 110 nM), EGFR (IC50 500 nM)
                    and the rearranged during transfection (RET; IC50130 nM) kinase.
                    Further studies on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) have found
                    vandetanib to potently inhibit proliferation of VEGFR stimulated cells
                        (IC50 60 nM) with higher doses necessary for EGFR stimulated
                    HUVEC proliferation (IC50 170 nM). Additional in
                    vitro and in vivo studies have also demonstrated that
                    vandetanib inhibits cell growth of several human cancer cell lines that have
                    functional EGFR but are devoid of VEGFR-2, and further potentiates the
                    anti-proliferative effects of docetaxel and paclitaxel.21,31 Xenograft models have in turn shown dose dependent inhibition of
                    tumor growth with vandetanib, including NSCLC tumors resistant to gefitinib, and
                    reduction in tumor microvessel density and inhibition of new blood vessel
                        formation.30,32–34 Together, these and other
                    preclinical studies suggest the effect of vandetanib on tumor growth and
                    survival is mediated by both the EGFR and VEGR pathways, and support further
                    clinical evaluation.

Phase I studies
Two Phase I dose escalation studies evaluating daily vandetanib alone in advanced
                solid tumors have been completed. The first was conducted in the United States and
                Australia, enrolling 77 patients, with colon cancer being the most common tumor
                    type.35 Dose limiting
                toxicities included diarrhea, hypertension and rash. The recommended dose to
                evaluate in further studies was 300 mg daily. This dose was tolerated well, with the
                most common toxicities being rash and diarrhea. Asymptomatic QTc prolongation was
                also observed in 7 patients. Pharmacokinetic studies showed vandetanib to be
                extensively distributed, with a half life of approximately 120 hours and a minimum
                of 28 days continuous oral dosing required to achieve steady-state plasma
                concentrations. The second Phase I study was conducted in Japan, and enrolled 18
                    patients.36 Again, 300 mg daily
                was determined to be the recommended dose with similar toxicity profile and
                pharmacokinetic findings. Of note, four of nine patients with advanced refractory
                NSCLC achieved a partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
                (RECIST) criteria at doses of 200 or 300 mg daily.

A third Phase I trial further evaluated vandetanib in combination with pemetrexed, a
                newer anti-folate approved for use in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.37 Only patients with advanced NSCLC
                who failed first line chemotherapy were eligible. Two dose levels of vandetanib were
                evaluated, 100 mg and 300 mg daily, given with full doses of pemetrexed every three
                weeks. Both doses were well tolerated, without obvious pharmacokinetic interactions.
                Of the 21 patients enrolled, one achieved a partial response by RECIST criteria
                (from the vandetanib 100 mg cohort), and an additional 13 patients had stabilization
                of disease.

Phase II studies
Based on encouraging activity in Phase I studies with good tolerability of vandetanib
                up to 300 mg daily, four randomized Phase II trials evaluating vandetanib alone and
                in combination with chemotherapy have been conducted in advanced NSCLC (Table 1).38–41 These trials confirmed the good tolerability of
                vandetanib seen in Phase I studies, with modest activity supporting Phase III
                evaluations. The most common side effects experienced were rash, diarrhea,
                hypertension, and asymptomatic prolonged QTc interval. In the two studies where
                vandetanib was combined with chemotherapy, there were no pharmacokinetic
                interactions. Interestingly, the study evaluating two dose levels of vandetanib with
                standard docetaxel dosing suggested that a lower dose of vandetanib may be more
                beneficial when combined with chemotherapy. One hypothesis offered to explain this
                has been that with greater inhibition of EGFR achieved with higher doses of
                vandetanib, cancer cell proliferation is decreased with G1 cell cycle arrest
                compromising effectiveness of cell cycle phase-dependent activity of
                    chemotherapy.42 Four Phase III
                trials evaluating the addition of a small molecule EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib or
                gefitinib) to standard first line chemotherapy support this, with no benefit
                    appreciated.43–46

Correlative studies from the randomized Phase II studies included serum markers (ie,
                several cytokines and angiogenic factors including VEGF) and tumor tissue analysis
                for EGFR and KRAS mutational status, and EGFR gene copy number by FISH.38,41,47,48 Limited samples
                preclude any conclusions; however, there was a suggestion that circulating VEGF
                levels may be a potential biomarker, with lower values being more predictive of
                benefit. Additional biomarker studies are clearly needed, and such analyses from
                Phase III studies are awaited.

Phase III studies
Three Phase III clinical trials evaluating vandetanib were presented at the American
                Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in 2009 and are awaiting formal
                publication. Two of the studies investigated vandetanib in combination with standard
                second-line chemotherapy, and the third compared vandetanib to erlotinib.

ZEST
Based on the Phase II study by Natale et al39 showing promising data for vandetanib versus
                    gefitinib as monotherapy in previously treated NSCLC (Table 1), the ZEST (ZACTIMA Efficacy Study versus
                    Tarceva) trial was designed with the primary objective to show superiority in
                    progression-free survival (PFS) for vandetanib versus erlotinib.49 A total of 1,240 patients with
                    advanced lung cancer who had received previous therapy (all histologies
                    permitted) were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either vandetanib 300 mg/day (n
                    = 623) or erlotinib 150 mg/day (n = 617). After a median
                    duration of follow up of 14 months, this study failed to show any difference in
                    PFS for patients treated with vandetanib (hazard ratio
                    [HR] 0.98; 95.22% confidence interval
                    [CI]: 0.87–1.10; P
                    = 0.721). Secondary endpoints including overall survival, objective
                    response rate, and time to deterioration of symptoms were similar in both
                    groups. There was a higher incidence of adverse events in the vandetanib group,
                    including diarrhea, hypertension, and rash.

ZEAL
The ZEAL (ZACTIMA Efficacy with Alimta in Lung cancer) trial evaluated the
                    addition of vandetanib to pemetrexed.50 The prior Phase I trial of this combination by De Boer et al37 demonstrated the safety and
                    tolerability of vandetanib when given with pemetrexed. Vandetanib doses of 100
                    mg/day were better tolerated than doses of 300 mg/day. This observation and the
                    concern about theoretical antagonism with chemotherapy from greater EGFR
                    inhibition achieved with the 300 mg dose led De Boer and colleagues to choose
                    the 100 mg dose in the ZEAL study. Patients were randomized to vandetanib 100
                    mg/day plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every three weeks (n =
                    256) versus placebo plus pemetrexed (n = 278), with the primary
                    endpoint of PFS. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective
                    response rate, time to deterioration of symptoms, and safety. Patients received
                    up to six cycles of chemotherapy. All patients had advanced NSCLC previously
                    treated with first-line therapy and all histologies were included. After a
                    median follow up duration of nine months, this study showed a trend for improved
                    PFS (HR, 0.86; 97.58% CI: 0.69–1.06, P
                    = 0.108) and OS (HR, 0.86; 97.54% CI:
                    0.65–1.13; P = 0.219); however, these
                    results were not statistically significant. As demonstrated in other studies,
                    the adverse events with vandetanib were most commonly rash (Grade
                    3+: 38% in vandetanib arm vs 26% in placebo
                    arm), diarrhea (26% vs 18%), and hypertension
                    (12% vs 3%). Interestingly, typical side effects of
                    pemetrexed, such as anemia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, were reduced in the arm
                    receiving vandetanib.

ZODIAC
The Phase III ZODIAC (ZACTIMA in cOmbination with Docetaxel In non-smAll cell
                    lung Cancer) trial randomized over one thousand patients with advanced NSCLC who
                    had received first line chemotherapy to two groups: vandetanib 100 mg/day plus
                    docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every three weeks (n = 694) or to
                    placebo plus docetaxel (n = 697).51 Patients were given up to 6 cycles of
                    chemotherapy. This study had a median duration of follow up of 12.8 months. This
                    study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant
                    improvement in PFS for the arm treated with vandetanib plus docetaxel (HR, 0.79;
                    97.58% CI: 0.70–0.90; P <
                    0.001). Median PFS was 8.9 months in those receiving vandetanib and 4 months in
                    those in the chemotherapy only arm. Difference in overall survival; however, was
                    not statistically significant in those receiving vandetanib (HR, 0.91;
                    97.52% CI: 0.78–1.07; P =
                    0.196). Not surprisingly, the adverse event profile was similar to that
                    previously observed with vandetanib in NSCLC. Patients in the vandetanib arm
                    experienced more diarrhea, rash, and neutropenia. The incidence of
                    protocol-defined QTc prolongation was <2% in patients
                    receiving vandetanib.

Conclusions
The future of vandetanib in NSCLC is uncertain. In late October 2009, Astra Zeneca
                announced that it was withdrawing regulatory submissions for use of vandetanib 100
                mg in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC after initial
                application to the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency in June 2009. This was
                based on only modest PFS with no overall survival advantage with the addition of
                vandetanib to docetaxel in the ZODIAC trial. With negative results of the ZEAL and
                ZEST trial presented at the annual ASCO conference last year, further evaluation of
                vandetanib as monotherapy or with pemetrexed in unselected patients with NSCLC is
                unlikely. There are still several ongoing clinical trials evaluating vandetanib in
                various settings (see Table 2), and
                the results of these will help determine if an indication will be reached in NSCLC.
                Of particular importance will be the identification of clinical and molecular
                predictors of benefit from vandetanib, and correlative biomarkers from randomized
                trials are awaited. Without such predictors, further development of Zactima in NSCLC
                is unlikely.
