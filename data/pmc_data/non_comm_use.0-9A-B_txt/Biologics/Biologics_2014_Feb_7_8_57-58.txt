On page 418, note that under Search strategy, Merck-Shire-Dome should have been listed as Merck, Sharp, and Dohme.

On page 421, Figure 2, the relative risk for golimumab versus placebo for the PsARC response was incorrectly listed as 2.45, and should be 3.45. The mean difference for etanercept versus placebo for the PASI response was incorrectly listed as 2.13, and should be 3.13. The x-axis of the PASI forest plot was incorrectly labeled with mean difference values of 1, 2, 3 and 4. The correct values are 3, 6, 9 and 12.
