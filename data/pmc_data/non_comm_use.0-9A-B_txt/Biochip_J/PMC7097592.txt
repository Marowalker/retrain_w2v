In here, we first investigated the individual and combinatory effects of candidate chemicals which might be composed of the direct buffer on the PCR inhibition reduction of main compositions in whole blood. The long and short PEGs, Na2SO4 and GuSCN were selected as representative kosmotropic and chaotropic salts, respectively. MgCl2 were chosen as divalent cation source and NaOH was used to control blood pH. The effect of common non-ionic biological detergent was tested with Triton X-100 and SDS (Sodium Dodecyl sulfate) was chosen as anionic detergent. These results could provide a foundation for the development of sample preparation solution in nucleic acid based diagnostic field. As a result, the direct buffer developed in this study was able to detect viruses with a concentration of 102 pfu/100 μL of whole blood by a very simple method.
