(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).Assessment of physician workloads has become increasingly important in modern academic
physician practice, where it is commonly used to allocate resources among departments, to
determine staffing, and to set the compensation of individual physicians. The physician
work relative value unit system is a frequently used metric in this regard. However, the
application of this system to the practice of pathology has proven problematic. One area
of uncertainty is the validity of using work relative value unit norms that were derived
from general surgical pathology practice to assess the various subspecialties within
anatomic pathology. Here, we used data from the 2017 Association of Pathology Chairs
practice survey to assess salary and work relative value unit data for single-subspecialty
practitioners in US academic pathology departments in the prior year (2016). Five
subspecialties were evaluated: dermatopathology, gastrointestinal pathology,
hematopathology/hematology, renal pathology, and neuropathology. Data for general surgical
pathologists and cytopathologists were included for comparison. For this analysis, survey
data were available for 168 practitioners in 43 US academic departments of pathology.
Salary ranges varied little among subspecialties, with the exception of dermatopathology,
where salaries were higher. In contrast, work relative value unit productivity varied
widely among different subspecialties, with median values differing as much as 4- to
7-fold between subspecialties. These results suggest that the use of a single overall work
relative value unit standard is not appropriate for specialty- or subspecialty-based
anatomic pathology practice, and that either the benchmark norms should be tailored to
individual practice patterns, or an alternative system of workload measurement should be
developed.

==== Body
Introduction
Assessment of physician workloads has become increasingly important, as many physicians
move to salaried, hospital-based, or group-based practices and as bundled payments by
third-party payers make it difficult to attribute specific dollar reimbursement amounts to
individual practitioners. The physician work relative value unit (wRVU) system was
introduced in 19881 as a system for quantifying the professional effort required for diverse physician
activities both within and across specialties. Time, technical skill and effort, mental
effort and judgment, and any attendant stresses are among the factors ostensibly used in
ascribing wRVUs to a given physician activity. The original study by Hsaio and coworkers1 was based on surveys of physicians in only 4 specialties that, notably, did not
include pathology. This system has since been applied across virtually all clinical
specialties, including pathology, to determine workload—and reimbursement—by third-party
payers as well as by individual hospitals, university-based practice plans, and private
groups.

The application of this system to the practice of pathology has proven problematic. In
particular, there is as yet no recognized system for assigning wRVUs to many areas of
pathology practice, such as autopsy pathology, forensic practice, or almost all of
laboratory medicine. For the specialties of general surgical pathology and cytopathology,
wRVUs are commonly used to measure workload and productivity, although reported benchmark
numbers vary widely based on the methodologies used to define and calculate these benchmarks.2 A question that remains is the applicability of surgical pathology wRVU norms, which
are derived from general surgical pathology practice, to practitioners of individual
subspecialties. To our knowledge, there has not previously been a systematic study of wRVU
measures as they apply to specific subspecialty practices within anatomic pathology.

Methods
The Association of Pathology Chairs Practice Survey
The Association of Pathology Chairs (APC) practice survey design has been described in
detail by Ducatman and Parslow.2 The present report is based exclusively on the APC’s 2017 annual survey, which
gathered data from the preceding year (ie, 2016). The survey was conducted by the APC’s
Practice and Management Committee, and all member departments of the APC were invited to
participate. The APC represents pathology departments in 170 US medical teaching
institutions, including virtually all 88 US academic medical centers who are members of
the Association of Academic Health Centers.3 Ducatman and Parslow2 previously reported a detailed analysis of data from the 2015 APC survey, providing
normative information on clinical effort (both Part A and Part B), educational effort,
research effort, median total salary, annual days on clinical service, and wRVUs for
surgical pathologists practicing (1) general surgical pathology, (2) one or more
subspecialties, or (3) a hybrid of general surgical pathology plus some subspecialty
practice, using data from 2014. However, assessment of those data for specific
subspecialty practices was limited by low numbers of practitioners within each
subspecialty in the 2015 survey database.

Definitions of Survey Salary Terms
The survey asked respondents for the following 3 data points (in addition to other data
points) for individual pathologists: (1) base salary for individual (last full year
available) not including fringes, (2) incentive salary for individual (last full year
available) not including fringes, and (iii) fringe rate as a decimal. These terms were not
further defined in the survey.

For the 2017 survey, conducted from January to April 2017, respondents were asked to
preferentially provide data on single subspecialty practitioners for 2016, with the aim of
obtaining a robust representation of such practitioners that would allow further
subspecialty analysis. Chairs or administrators at participating APC institutions were
asked to provide specific data on individual faculty pathologists practicing at their own
institution during the most recently completed fiscal year. Because all data were
completely anonymized and deidentified as to program and individual prior to submission to
the APC, this study was exempt from institutional review board review. The present study
used data from the 2017 survey only, which was merged into a single Excel®
spreadsheet.

Compensation Analyses
We included data from all responding institutions to develop mean, median, and quartile
data for pathologists’ total annual compensation (base + incentive), stratified by
doctoral-level degree, by academic rank, and by geographic region. Geographic regions were
used as defined by the APC.4 We also assessed fringe benefit rates and incentive salary as a percentage of total
salary. We further analyzed salary data by years-in-rank for assistant professors.

Subspecialty Analyses
Reporting departments were asked to specify the scope of each individual’s practice,
choosing from a list of specialties and subspecialties. Our present analysis focused on
those anatomic pathology categories for which data were reported on 10 or more
practitioners, except that all autopsy and forensic pathologists were excluded. The
subspecialties analyzed were dermatopathology, gastrointestinal (GI) pathology,
hematopathology/hematology, renal pathology, and neuropathology. Data for practitioners of
general surgical pathology and of cytopathology were included for comparison. Mean,
median, and quartile data for total compensation and for wRVUs were assessed. Departments
were also asked to specify the proportion of each individual’s professional effort that
was devoted to such practice (ie, the clinical full-time equivalent, cFTE).

Work Relative Value Unit Analyses
Except where otherwise noted, all analyses presented here focused on absolute (raw) wRVU
production as reported for each pathologist in a given practice category. Two alternative
formats were prepared for purposes of comparison. The first alternative format likewise
depicts raw wRVU data but only for the subset of practitioners within each category who
had a reported cFTE of 0.67 or greater; this is intended to approximate the method used by
the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) to report physician wRVU data. The second
alternative format includes data only for those practitioners with a reported cFTE of 0.60
or greater (or, in the case of hematopathologists, 0.5 FTE or greater) but normalized each
practitioner’s actual wRVU production to that individual’s reported cFTE; the resulting
wRVU/cFTE ratio is intended to approximate the method used by Vizient (and previously by
the Faculty Practice Solutions Center, FPSC) to report physician wRVU productivity. See
Ducatman and Parslow2 for a discussion of the implications of these alternative benchmarking
methodologies.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical tests for significance were performed in JMP version 13.0 (Cary, North
Carolina) by one of the authors (B.S.D.). Since the data are nonparametric, particularly
when using MGMA and Vizient methodologies, the Wilcoxon Kruskal-Wallis test was applied
for most analyses reported here.

Study Population
Anonymized survey data from 2016 were available for a total of 918 faculty members from
43 US departments of pathology. We first analyzed individual pathologists’ total
compensation (defined as base pay plus any incentives but excluding fringe benefits) as a
function of academic rank, professional degree, and geographic region, determining the
mean, median, first quartile, and third quartile of compensation for each group. Analyses
of the distributions of fringe benefits and incentive salary (each as a percent of total
salary) were performed for 836 faculty members for whom these data were available, and the
results were then further substratified by geographic region.

For analyses of wRVU data, we focused on the subset of 168 faculty members who were
identified by their departments as exclusively practicing general surgical pathology (n =
54), cytopathology (n = 15), or 1 of 5 subspecialties for which requisite data on at least
10 practitioners had been reported. The latter subspecialties were hematopathology (n =
39), renal pathology (n = 19), neuropathology (n = 15), dermatopathology (n = 14), and GI
pathology (n = 12). Practitioners of 2 anatomic pathology subspecialties for which wRVU
data are not available (autopsy and forensic pathology) were not included in our
analysis.

Results
Median Salary Compensation Data for All US Pathology Faculty
Salary data for US academic pathologists, stratified by degree, by academic rank, and by
senior administrative titles (Chief or Chair), are presented in Table 1. For PhD faculty, median salaries range
from US$131 000 for assistant professors to US$188 000 for full professors. The respective
figures for those with medical degrees (MD, DO, or MD/PhD) range from US$198 000 for
MD/PhD assistant professors to US$290 000 for MD professors. Interestingly, median
salaries for MD/PhD faculty are consistently lower than those for MD-only faculty,
although the absolute differences are small and not statistically significant (Wilcoxon
Kruskal-Wallis). For all subsequent analyses, data for faculty with different medical
degrees (MD, DO, or MD/PhD) were pooled to maximize the numbers of individuals in each
subcategory. When total annual compensation was further substratified according to
years-in-rank for either MD (including MD/PhD) or PhD faculty, the lines of regression
were essentially flat for all ranks, suggesting that rank remains the primary determinant
of salary, whereas time-in-rank has a comparatively minor and statistically insignificant
effect at least when compared across departments nationally.

Median Salary Compensation Data for Geographic Regions
Analyses of total compensation data by geographic region are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Some variation is apparent: For
example, median salaries are lowest in the Midwest and highest in the West for faculty at
the rank of assistant professor, whereas the opposite relationship prevails for those at
the level of professor (Table
2). For PhD faculty (Table
3), by contrast, median salaries are highest in the Northeast for assistant
professors and highest in the Midwest for professors. However, none of these differences
reached statistical significance.

Distributions of Fringe Rates and Incentive Salary
Reported fringe rates showed dramatic variation across our data set, ranging from 0% to
59% across the 836 practitioners for whom data were obtained. This distribution is shown
graphically in Figure 1.
Approximately two-thirds of practitioners had fringe rates between 15% and 30% (Figure 2). Incentive salary, as a
percentage of total compensation, varied from 0% to 54%. Interestingly, a significant
number of practitioners (ranging from fewer than 10% in the Northeast to approximately 50%
in the West) received no incentive compensation at all in 2016, as reported by their
departments, although it is not clear what proportion of this group might have been
eligible for incentive pay but did not receive it (see Figure 2). In contrast to fringe rate data, there is
no identifiable subrange that accounts for a majority of individuals, although incentive
compensation rates above 20% are only seen for a small minority of practitioners.
Surprisingly, there were marked statistically significant differences in the ratio of
incentive pay to total compensation across regions (P < .0001), with
the Southeast having the highest median fraction of incentive compared to total pay
(9.35%), followed by the Northeast (5.32%), with the West and Midwest tied (4.76%).

Salary and Work Relative Value Unit Data for Single-Subspecialty
Practitioners
A major focus of the 2017 APC Practice and Management survey was on the collection of
salary and wRVU data for single subspecialty practitioners. These data are presented in
Tables 4 and 5. Sufficient data (ie, for 10 or
more practitioners) were available for analysis of 2 anatomic pathology specialties
(general surgical pathology and cytopathology) and for 5 subspecialties (dermatopathology,
GI pathology, hematopathology, renal pathology, and neuropathology). Except for
dermatopathology (median total salary US$347 309), the salaries for these groups do not
vary widely, with median salaries ranging from about US$230 000 to US$270 000 (see Table 4). Pairwise comparisons
among these groups failed to reach statistical significance, even when stratified by rank,
except that salaries of dermatopathologists were significantly higher than those of
practitioners in any of the other individual categories (P < .014),
both overall and when stratified by academic rank.

§Raw wRVU production normalized to reported cFTE only by the subset of

greater (| or 0.5 or greater for hematopathologists). This analysis was intended to
approximate the productivity benchmarking metric reported by Vizient-AAMC Faculty
Practice Solutions Center (FPSC).

In contrast to salary, wRVU productivity varied widely among different anatomic pathology
specialties and subspecialties (Table
5). Differences were highly statistically significant and were apparent
regardless of the type of analysis applied: (1) raw actual wRVU data per practitioner; (2)
raw actual wRVU data per practitioner only for practitioners with at least 0.67 cFTE (MGMA
method), or (3) wRVUs normalized for cFTE, and only for practitioners with >0.60 cFTE
(Vizient method). As has been observed previously,2 values derived using methods (1) and (2) were generally concordant, whereas method
(3) yielded substantially higher values in all subcategories, largely as a result of
normalizing raw wRVU production to reported cFTE. Regardless of the method used,
dermatopathologists consistently showed the highest wRVU numbers, with annual medians of
8023 actual wRVUs, 8119 actual wRVUs for cFTE ≥0.67 (MGMA method), and 10 053 normalized
wRVUs for cFTE >0.60 (Vizient method). Neuropathologists, by contrast, consistently
showed the lowest wRVU numbers, with annual median productivity of 1361 for actual wRVUs,
1153 by MGMA methodology, and 1593 wRVUs by the Vizient method. For general surgical
pathologists, the corresponding medians are 5790 actual and 6073 or 8343 wRVUs by the MGMA
or Vizient methods, respectively.

We compared the results of the present survey, which were based on data from 2016, to
those in our earlier report2 that utilized data from 2014, in search of historical trends. In accord with
MGMA-type methodology, the earlier paper had focused primarily on “full-time”
practitioners, defined as those with cFTE of 0.67 or greater, so the present comparison
was restricted to that subgroup as well. Both reports presented relevant data from
sufficient numbers of (ie, 10 or more) practitioners of surgical pathology, cytopathology,
dermatopathology, neuropathology, and renal pathology to allow direct comparisons within
those categories.

In comparing the present data with the previous survey (analyzed in 2015 based on 2014
data, and herein referred to as 2015 survey to keep the reference dates similar), we found
that median salary data for all MD/DO faculty showed small increases from 2015 to 2017
(assistant professor US$202 710 in 2017, n = 265 vs US$200 391 in 2015; n = 252),
associate professor (US$245 689 in 2017; n = 223 vs US$243 176 in 2015; n = 166), and full
professor (US$294 890 in 2017; n = 258 vs US$289 405; n = 189). Whether these small
differences are meaningful cannot be determined. As for workload, we compared data from
the 2 surveys for general surgical pathologists, and found that the median wRVU workload
(MGMA-type analysis) was quite comparable between the 2 surveys (5371 wRVUs in 2017 vs
5,786 wRVUs in 2015). We did find differences in median workload for subspecialists
between the 2 surveys, but given the small number of individuals in both surveys in this
pool, we believe the numbers are too small for meaningful comparison.

Discussion
The 2017 APC survey gathered comprehensive nationwide data on the compensation and wRVU
productivity for academic anatomic pathologists in individual anatomic pathology
subspecialties. Anonymized data were gathered on more than 160 faculty subspecialists from
43 academic pathology departments; these had been submitted by departmental leaders with a
nuanced understanding of pathology practice patterns and terminology, which is likely to
have maximized the validity of the data obtained. Based on data from this survey, the
present study has yielded detailed information on salaries and wRVU outputs of
single-subspecialty practitioners in 5 major fields of anatomic pathology and allowed
comparison of those data with the corresponding values for cytopathologists and general
surgical pathologists from the same survey database. These benchmarks were further
substratified by academic rank, years at rank, academic degree, senior administrative title,
and geographical region as summarized in the tables contained in this report.

A key finding of this study is that average annual wRVU productivity varies widely across
different subspecialties. Median raw annual wRVU outputs of academic dermatopathologists and
GI pathologists, for example, were found to exceed those of neuropathologists by 5.8- and
4.2-fold, respectively, and were 17% to 74% higher than the corresponding values for
generalist surgical pathologists, cytopathologists, or hematopathologists (Table 4). We do not believe that
academic department chairs will be surprised by those disparities, nor find them a valid
reflection of either clinical workload or relative value across these vital, demanding
clinical disciplines.

Our findings suggest that wRVUs have limited validity as a measure of pathologist workloads
or productivity for individual practitioners. This is particularly true for academic
pathology departments, where a variety of practice models and wide disparities in effort
allocations exist among institutions, especially when comparing across subspecialties.
Accordingly, caution must be exercised when applying wRVUs to define individual productivity
benchmarks or to set targets for incentive-based compensation models. Concerns arise when
wRVU output is normalized to cFTE, since the allocation model used to assign cFTE values to
individual practitioners varies widely among departments and institutions.2 Normalizing wRVUs by dividing by clinical effort allocation can significantly
overstate actual wRVU production, yielding artificial “benchmark” values for median wRVU
output that are achieved by only a small fraction of practitioners (Table 5). These findings argue that the use of wRVUs
as a productivity metric in anatomic pathologists should be narrowly tailored to local
practice environments or that alternative systems of workload measurement should be
considered.

Indeed, it is both notable and reassuring that, aside from the higher salaries presently
commanded by dermatopathologists, median compensation varies relatively little, either
between the other 4 subspecialties we examined or in comparison to general surgical
pathologists and cytopathologists nationally (Table 4). We view this as evidence that pathology
departments set compensation in a relatively egalitarian manner that presumably reflects
market forces and is not closely linked to individuals’ wRVU productivity. Thus, although
wRVUs are a poor marker for productivity, academic departments have found a way to balance
workloads and compensation across subspecialties. In addition, most academic pathology
departments take into account not only clinical productivity but also administrative,
educational, and research metrics; thus finding ways to reward pathology faculty across all
the academic missions. Finally, the trend toward ever-higher clinical productivity bears
close watching, as this may impact our other academic missions, especially if unaccompanied
by commensurate salary increases.

As for alternative systems of measuring workload and productivity in pathology, Cloetingh
et al5 compared 3 methods for measuring workload in surgical pathology and cytopathology:
(1) the wRVU system, (2) a point system developed by the Royal College of Pathologists (RCP),6 and (3) a slide-count system developed by the authors at the University of Washington
in Seattle (UW).5 They found that the wRVU system favors specialties with higher volumes of small
specimens (eg, dermatopathology), whereas the RCP system provides more weight for higher
complexity specimens, and the UW system favors specialties with extensively sampled large
specimens. Horne et al,7 however, specifically applied the RCP system to dermatopathology workload in a
time-motion study, and concluded that this system underestimated workloads achieved by
experienced dermatopathologists, and thus was not ideally applicable to that
subspecialty.

Meijer et al8 measured the actual time that pathologists spent in various steps of specimen
preparation and diagnosis (eg, gross examination, microscopical examination, dictation,
etc). These authors found that such time measurements correlate well with numbers of tissue
blocks and/or slides per specimen, thus suggesting that counts of tissue blocks or slides
might be a useful system for measuring pathologist workload in a variety of practice
settings.

Yet another system for measuring workload in surgical pathology was developed by Cheung et al9 at the University of Toronto and is known as the Automatable Activity-Based Approach
to Complexity Unit Scoring (AABACUS). This system uses clinical laboratories’ information
systems to calculate “complexity factors” for different activities and, based on these,
generates “complexity units” (CUs) for each of activity performed. The system has the
advantage that it can be automated (as the name suggests), thus requiring little additional
work after initial implementation. A major finding in this latter study is that the
resulting CU counts are generally comparable for different anatomic pathology
subspecialists, ranging from dermatopathology to neuropathology, which may suggest that
AABACUS is a better index of actual work performed than are other extant systems.

As mentioned above, workload assessment for autopsy or forensic pathologists is
particularly problematic, as their work products have no assigned wRVU value and do not
involve billing to third-party payers. The Autopsy Committee of the College of American
Pathologists developed a recommendation,10 based on a survey of autopsy pathologists, that one full adult autopsy be valued at
5.5 times a CPT code 88309-26, with an additional value of 1.5 times 88309-26 attributed for
full-brain examination. They also recommended a value of 4 times 88309-26 be attributed for
a fetal or neonatal autopsy.

Our study is survey based and, as such, we cannot independently verify the data submitted
nor establish that the results are representative of all academic departments. However, the
substantial number of departments participating in the survey (43 academic departments of
pathology) represents nearly half of the 88 US academic medical centers who are members of
the Association of Academic Health Centers.3 Responding departments were not required to submit data for every faculty
practitioner but instead were given the option of providing data only for a minimum of 10
representative practitioners. This was to encourage survey participation by larger
departments, which might otherwise find the survey overly burdensome, but it may have
introduced selection bias. For the 2017 survey, departments were asked to focus on single
subspecialty practitioners where possible, thus enriching the survey population in this
regard. This approach was different from that of previous APC surveys, which did not request
such selective inclusion,2 and it is this enrichment that allowed us to perform, for the first time, meaningful
analysis of subspecialty practice in US academic pathology departments.

Summary and Conclusions
The use of wRVUs as a measure of workload and productivity by pathologists is inherently
flawed. Although wRVUs might be of some use in comparing pathologists who have identical
practice patterns (eg, general surgical pathologists, cytopathologists, or practitioners of
a single given subspecialty), this measurement system fails dramatically when used to
compare different anatomic pathology subspecialties, even when restricted to nonautopsy and
nonforensic practices. Of course, the lack of a valid, standardized, and widely accepted
workload measurement system for clinical pathology practice is well recognized.

Unfortunately, insofar as the wRVU system has been adopted as the metric for payment by the
government and most insurers, it inextricably forms the basis for reimbursement and,
consequently, for compensation. If, as is widely assumed, future reimbursement shifts
increasingly from a fee-for-service model centered on wRVUs to value-based payments, it is
possible that wRVUs will lose their importance other than as a benchmark for departmental
staffing. Until that time, we recommend that pathology departments try to use wRVU
production as a department-wide rather than an individual benchmark, although it is still
highly problematic as the former. Additionally, we recommend that pathology chairs
understand both the effort allocation and the subspecialty issues associated with wRVU
benchmarks in order to more effectively advocate for their faculty and to design equitable
compensation policies. Fortunately, this seems currently to be case for most departments who
participated in the 2017 APC survey.
