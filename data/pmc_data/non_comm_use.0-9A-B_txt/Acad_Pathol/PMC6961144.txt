play an increased role in population health by improving outcomes and safety as well as
reducing costs. Although laboratory testing itself accounts for a small portion of
health-care spending, laboratory data have significant downstream effects in patient
management as well as diagnosis. Pathologists currently are heavily engaged in precision
medicine, use of laboratory and pathology test results (including autopsy data) to reduce
diagnostic errors, and play leading roles in diagnostic management teams. Additionally,
pathologists can use aggregate laboratory data to monitor the health of populations and
improve health-care outcomes for both individual patients and populations. For the
profession to thrive, pathologists will need to focus on extending their roles outside the
laboratory beyond the traditional role in the analytic phase of testing. This should
include leadership in ensuring correct ordering and interpretation of laboratory testing
and leadership in population health programs. Pathologists in training will need to learn
key concepts in informatics and data analytics, health-care economics, public health,
implementation science, and health systems science. While these changes may reduce
reimbursement for the traditional activities of pathologists, new opportunities arise for
value creation and new compensation models. This report reviews these opportunities for
pathologist leadership in utilization management, precision medicine, reducing diagnostic
errors, and improving health-care outcomes.

The Opportunities for Pathology and Pathologists
Expenditures for health care in the United States were approximately $3.65 trillion in
2018, an increase of 4.4% over the prior year, and are projected to rise from 17.9% of gross
domestic product in 2017 to 19.4% in 2027 if current trends continue.1 Health-care spending also rose 4.8% in 2016 and 5.8% in 2017, well above the
inflation rate, which currently is 1.6%. Absent substantive changes in the efficiency of
delivering American health care, this trend is expected to accelerate due to aging of the
baby boom generation and the corresponding increase in utilization of medical services.1 Clearly, such a trend would be unsustainable, as it would result in an
ever-increasing taxpayer burden for government subsidies.2 Moreover, an increasing gap between demand and capacity without increased resources
and efficiency would ultimately result in poorer outcomes and diminished access to needed
care.

In vitro laboratory tests have been estimated to account for only 2.3% of total health-care dollars3 or around $82.7 billion in 2017 (Figure 1). Laboratory testing may increase with the expansion of value-based
reimbursement and precision medicine but will likely remain a small part of overall
health-care expenses, especially as new and expensive therapies are implemented. However,
while laboratory tests are a small portion of health-care expenditures, 94% of objective and
structured data in the electronic medical record (EMR) are from the clinical laboratory.4 Moreover, some reports suggest that 70% of all medical decisions are based on
laboratory testing.5


Figure 1. The estimated proportion of laboratory test costs when compared to all other US
health-care costs in 2017 (US$).

A recent literature review, with physician specialist interviews and an Internet-based
multiple choice survey, estimated that an average of 74% of cardiology and oncology patients
in the United States had laboratory tests, which influenced an average of 64% of medical decisions.3 Laboratory tests were most often used for initial diagnosis, followed by treatment
and posttreatment monitoring. A report published in 2017 found that 35% of 72 196 patient
encounters studied had laboratory testing.6 However, this varied substantially: Almost all inpatients (98%) had 1 or more
laboratory tests, compared to 56% of emergency clinic patients and 29% of outpatients.6 A different perspective is that laboratory testing approaches 100% for patients being
evaluated and managed for infectious diseases, genetic disorders, neoplastic diseases,
myocardial infarction, therapeutic drug monitoring, and other conditions,7 with the World Health Organization citing 58 essential diagnostic tests for diagnosis
and treatment of human disease.8


Considering base hospital and physician costs for 2017 (approximately $1.85 trillion) and
using 64% as the rate of influence on treatment decisions, laboratory tests influence
approximately $1.18 trillion of health-care spending (Figure 2). These “downstream effects” of laboratory
tests on clinical management include choices of medical procedures and therapy as well as
the ordering of additional diagnostic tests, especially in domains other than the
laboratory.

when compared to those not influenced by laboratory testing.

With diagnostic activities in anatomic and clinical pathology/laboratory medicine as the
largest part of their medical specialty, pathologists can significantly impact value-based
care and population health by reducing costs and improving the quality of patient care.9,10 While increasing the speed and accuracy of providing a diagnosis has been a historic
goal of pathologists, greater emphasis should be placed on optimizing the ability of a
provider and/or patient to initiate appropriate intervention in a timely fashion. It is well
understood that earlier intervention improves outcomes and reduces costs. For example, the
engagement of a pathologist who discusses biopsy findings proactively with the treating
clinician can reduce days of unnecessary waiting for a report to initiate treatment as well
as increase the chances of choosing an effective treatment. Without effective engagement
from experts in anatomic and clinical pathology/laboratory medicine, the converse is also
true: Unnecessary delays and errors in interpretation clearly lead to poorer clinical
outcomes and increased costs.11


Historically, the quality improvement role of pathologists has been in the analytic phase
of laboratory testing.12 The ongoing pivot to a value-based health-care payment system has resulted in an
increased effort by pathologists to improve appropriate test ordering (the “pre–pre”
analytic phase) and test interpretation (the “post–post” analytic phase).13 Published examples of interventions illustrate the diversity of opportunities
available: pre–pre analytic utilization management (including decision supports) to address
the long-standing “culture of ordering” that leads to the costs and safety hazards
associated with overutilization14-16 and decreasing post–post analytic phase misinterpretation of test results to reduce
diagnostic errors. By embracing these roles, pathologists can decrease health-care costs and
improve quality, thus creating value for health-care systems.17


Pathologists have been actively involved in many areas critical to the implementation of
population health and value-based health care. Four such areas where pathologists have the
opportunity to assume an even greater role and provide leadership include utilization
management, precision medicine, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving health-care
outcomes. Pathologists should seize the opportunity to improve health-care value in these
domains. In addition to improving public health, the role for pathologists in population
health and value-based care is essential for the profession to grow and thrive, particularly
as reimbursement shifts away from traditional models to reward improved outcomes and
efficiency.

Utilization Management
Clinical Scenario
A 45-year-old male patient arrives at the emergency department with a chief complaint of
chest pain. The patient is slightly overweight and does not exercise. He has no other risk
factors for coronary artery disease. An electrocardiogram is within normal limits. Blood
is drawn in this hospital for creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) (MB
index) and troponin I. Although troponin values are negative, CK and CKMB are elevated,
the patient is admitted for observation. Follow-up does not demonstrate evidence of a
myocardial infarct (MI) or any evidence of myocardial ischemia.

Although the accepted standard for exclusion of an MI is a normal value for troponin, the
use of redundant cardiac markers is still prevalent in the United States. Physicians often
argue that the tests are inexpensive; unfortunately, they fail to consider that the
cascade of decisions based upon unnecessary tests can be significant. Consider the cost of
a prolonged emergency department visit and an unnecessary admission for thousands of
patients across the country as well. The cost of the admission and further diagnostic
workup not only contribute to national health-care expenditures but also to individual
patients’ out-of-pocket costs as well as time off work and other social costs. There are
significant emotional costs of fear, anxiety, and concern to patients, families, and
friends during periods of diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty, as well as significant
health risks for the patient when invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization are involved.18


Clinicians from other specialties may be aware of guidelines but may still retain
low-value practices from simple momentum bias (we do not want to change unless a great
reason is provided).16 There is evidence that pathologists need to review data from their own institutions
in order to show the potential for harm associated with ordering the wrong test at the
wrong time or not ordering the right test at the right time.18,19 Data about the ordering practices linked to actual outcomes can address the
optimism bias inherent in human nature that “more is better” and that unconventional
reasons for intervention will improve care.18,19


The adoption of EMR and computerized order entry (CPOE) have facilitated laboratory test
ordering, data collection, and analysis,20 as well as interventions to reduce necessary and unnecessary testing.18,21-23 In theory, utilization management has already become a target for inpatient
clinical laboratory services, as payment for laboratory testing has been reduced,
particularly in the inpatient setting. A systematic review of publications between 1997
and 2012 identified more than 34 000 citations with medical subject headings for the
combination of “utilization” and “laboratory test(s).” A discouraging but not surprising
finding was that a review of these studies using strict criteria found only 42 (0.1%) of
them were well-done.24


The most common targets of utilization management are unnecessary, redundant, or
duplicative tests, whose elimination could potentially reduce laboratory costs 16% to 20%.24,25 Underutilization of tests leading to delayed or missed diagnosis is 2- to 3-fold
(44%-45%) more common than overutilization and likewise deserves intervention.24-26 In terms of health outcomes, underutilization is likely more important, yet it does
not have the same current national advocacy and that lack of parallel interest is
problematic. One study in a critical discipline (bleeding and thrombosis) found that
underutilization of laboratory tests resulted in only 55% of patients receiving
appropriate care.25 Difficult clinical scenarios are not the only setting for serious underutilization.
A minority of US patients receive all their high-priority clinical preventive services,
including indicated laboratory tests.27


Changes to CPOE, including best practice alerts, have been used to encourage orders of
needed tests, to discourage duplicative and obsolete testing, and to prevent misordering
of “look-alike” tests.22,23,28 It is increasingly recognized that CPOE changes alone achieve only a part of the
needed result29,30 and that a multimodal approach involving clinical colleagues is often more effective.18,23,31-33 Other forms of utilization management can involve removing tests from the menu (in
effect creating “test formularies”), requiring a pathologist review of specific tests,
especially low-volume, high-cost reference laboratory tests, and limiting some testing to
expert subspecialists.23,28


Test algorithms are increasingly used after the clinician orders an initial test.
Consistent use of laboratory recommended algorithms decreases costs significantly without
concomitant decrease in quality; one large urban academic center decreased inpatient test
utilization and blood component utilization (often reimbursed in a bundled payment such as
a diagnosis-related group (DRG)) by 26% for the average number of tests per patient
discharge and saved the hospital an estimated $1.7 million per year over 10 years.23 Targeted tests have included both rare and expensive genetics test, and common and
inexpensive tests such as basic metabolic profiles and complete blood counts.29 The recent and important efforts of the National “Choosing Wisely” campaign have
put a welcome emphasis on overutilization.34 Pathologists can take pride in the cooperative approaches that have emphasized
laboratory testing in so many of the “Choosing Wisely” recommendations for less intensive
care. However, we should be concerned that there is no parallel effort to address
underutilization, especially where it can improve targeted therapy.

An emerging literature suggests that utilization management at the systems level is “the”
important opportunity area for pathology expertise.21 Pathologists must be prepared to participate in and/or lead this process as a
routine part of practice, particularly since inclusions of trainees in quality improvement
studies are an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirement
for all residencies. While downstream savings associated with systems interventions are
likely to lead to the greatest value for society and the biggest change in pathology practice,18,24,28 these savings have been very difficult to quantify.18 Absent evidence, hospital administrators may not invest, federal and other insurers
may not recognize the work as having relative value, and funders of research may continue
to ignore the size, scope, and importance of the opportunity. As in every other investment
that is about the health of the public, the absence of evidence on the value of
utilization management threatens the role of pathology and the overall performance of the
health-care system. The importance of pathologists becoming engaged in health services
research to demonstrate the value of laboratory utilization management cannot be
overstated.

Precision Medicine
Expenditures for laboratory testing are projected to increase disproportionately to other
diagnostic costs, largely due to the projected rise in genetic tests from $5 billion in 2010
to $15 to 25 billion in 2021.35 However, the anticipated problem of increased costs for laboratory testing is small
in comparison to its downstream impact. Pathologists need to initiate and be actively
involved in evaluating the clinical utility of each new test at the time it is proposed for
introduction. Pathology expertise is essential to accurately assess the clinical benefit and
calculate the economic impact to determine true value. As an example, there is little value
in performing a more accurate genetic test for cystic fibrosis in advance of performing a
far less expensive chloride sweat test as a screening test.36


Pathology trainees must be given the expectation that this test assessment will be part of
their job along with the educational experience to perform test assessment effectively. This
requires familiarity with record-keeping and analytics and the ability to address issues
such as the concordance of marketed claims with actual test performance,37 the health-care impact relative to the cost, and potential ethical conflicts related
to the introduction of new tests demanded by clinicians.

Extensive pathology involvement can help address current public skepticism about aspects of
precision medicine.38 In particular, it is an opportunity to compare the effectiveness of next-generation
sequencing-based tests.39 The clinical utility of these tests is complicated by variations in data collected by
different technical platforms and the complexity of the data generated.37,39 In addition to traditional evaluation of diagnostic and clinical validity, more
complex economic analyses may be necessary to provide justification for the costs of such tests.40


Despite these issues, there are many situations where the significant clinical benefit and
value of such tests justify their current use. A good example is the successful evaluation
of companion diagnostics for targeted oncology therapies.41 Although such testing can be quite expensive, the benefit is that only patients with
the targeted genetic mutation who are likely to respond are treated with the even more
expensive targeted therapeutic, while those lacking the mutation would receive futile and
expensive care, with attendant risks for unnecessary adverse events.42-44 Another example is in the diagnosis of infections, where rapid molecular testing
provides a quicker diagnosis compared to standard testing, therefore improving patient
outcomes by reducing mortality, morbidity, hospital length of stay, and inappropriate
antibiotic use.45,46 Molecular testing has also been applied effectively in anatomic pathology; an example
is in testing equivocal thyroid cytology to better triage patients for surgery.47,48 An increasing number of these and other new tests demonstrate clinical efficacy and
illustrate value for population health.49


Screening tests are another important area of growth. The most well-known adjunct or
replacement of a traditional screening tool is the test for high-risk human papillomavirus.29,50-53 Many other tests are under development with pathologists involved in creation of
guidelines and algorithms.54 Molecular testing is increasingly used for noninvasive prenatal screening.55 When pathologists and genetic counselors work with clinicians to insure
appropriateness of testing and interpretation of results, the value is maximized.55-57 With pathologist guidance in the preanalytic and postanalytic phases of testing,
molecular tests will improve timeliness of diagnosis, reduce false negatives and false
positives by defining the right population with high pretest probability for the known
performance of the test, and decrease downstream medical errors and costs.

Reducing Diagnostic Errors
Measurement of error is an important step in identifying and reducing errors, and the
autopsy is the historical starting point for identifying medical errors.58-60 This power to detect large and small diagnostic error is known to persist in numerous
studies, despite increasingly sophisticated diagnostic techniques including imaging.61-67 Unfortunately, although the value of the autopsy in detecting diagnostic errors is
well-documented, the autopsy rate continues to fall in both academic and nonacademic hospitals.68,69


As autopsies for the sake of continuous quality improvement and trainee learning diminish
in frequency at many hospitals, especially outside academic medical centers, a related
concern is that uncaught errors are not entered onto death certificates, thus compromising
their quality for subsequent mortality studies. Public health is degraded when error is
missed and is further degraded when summary data are compromised by the absence of quality
approaches. Surgical pathology diagnoses also serve as feedback for medical errors to
clinicians and those in training. Pathologists reviewing surgical pathology cases can detect
trends for inappropriate management, collect and review data, and intervene with clinical
colleagues to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost.19


But errors in the realm of laboratory medicine are more pernicious and, perhaps, pervasive.
Misutilization—the ordering of laboratory tests that are inappropriate for the clinical
questions being asked—is fostered by the ever-increasing number of available laboratory
tests and the inability of busy physicians to stay abreast of their utility.56,70-72 Indeed, a resolution was recently passed by the House of Delegates of the American
Medical Association to close potential gaps in the training of physicians in use and
interpretation of laboratory tests.73 The following case illustrates the seriousness of this issue.

Clinical Scenario
A patient receives a laboratory test to diagnose a disease with a population prevalence
of 1%. The treatment for this disease carries significant risk for morbidity due to side
effects of the therapy. The test is positive but actually a false-positive result. The
clinician, reading the test characteristics of 95% specificity and 90% sensitivity,
decides the test is very specific and treats the patient with resulting complications.

Consider the outcomes for 1000 patients. A negative result offers 99.9% probability that
the patient does not have the disease. The test in this situation is very useful for
excluding patients who do not have disease. However, a positive result offers no such
reassurance that the patient has the disease. The chance of a patient having the disease
given a positive test is less than 20%, that is, if the laboratory test is used to make
the decision more than 5 patients without disease will be treated for every patient with
the disease. The lower the prevalence of a disease, the more likely that a positive result
is a false positive. As prevalence rises, the positive predictive value rises and the
negative predictive value falls, so that a positive test result is less helpful for a rare
disease and a negative result is less helpful for a common disease. The inability of many
physicians to interpret tests correctly has drawn attention in the lay press.74 The addition of Bayesian pretest probability to laboratory testing is an
operational way to think of the convergence of pathology and public health. In this
scenario, some readers may conclude that the test order is necessarily incorrect. That
interpretation is neither implied nor precluded in this scenario; the test may well be
required in order to take the next step toward a correct diagnosis. The correct message is
that the clinical interpretation requires expertise informed by experience with test
performance and understanding of the population context.

Reducing diagnostic error, the subject of a recent National Academy of Medicine (NAM)
report, has become an important goal for American medicine, as nearly all patients will
experience a diagnostic error in their lifetime.58,75-77 Diagnostic error is considered to be a failure of either the establishment of an
accurate and timely explanation for a patient’s health problems and/or failure to
accurately communicate this to the patient.58 The diagnostic process features complex steps in the preanalytic, analytic, and
postanalytic phases, with each step providing a chance for different types of critical
errors (Figure 3). Reduction in
true analytic errors is where pathologists have been most engaged, and there remain ample
opportunities to further reduce analytic errors in quality control, sample identification,
and test interference.78 However, true analytic errors are estimated to be ≤10% of
all errors in the diagnostic process as regards laboratory testing.78 Pathologists must also work to expand the footprint of quality oversight in the
diagnostic process. As examples, anatomic pathology has actively improved specimen
identification using bar coding from specimen acquisition to sign-out, as well as
encouraging second or consensus opinions.79-81


Figure 3. An updated view of the analytic process with steps to potentially reduce critical
diagnostic errors.

As mentioned earlier, most of the errors in clinical pathology occur in the preanalytic
and postanalytic phases.78 When clinicians do not order the correct tests (pre–pre analytic) or misinterpret
laboratory results (post–post analytic), misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis are possible,82 which diminish the quality of care and increase costs. The role of pathologists in
educating clinicians, guiding utilization, and interpreting results will become even more
critical, as the number and complexity of tests continue to increase. Laposata and Cohen
(both members of the NAM committee) have advocated pathologist involvement in many areas
to address medical errors, such as increase the teaching of laboratory medicine in medical
school and beyond, optimize laboratory information systems and improve the timely
reporting of results, provide feedback to clinicians on diagnostic errors and near-misses,
and acknowledge and learn from their own mistakes.83,84


There is substantial value for pathologists to become more engaged in the interpretation
and application of laboratory tests, especially as consultants with clinical colleagues,
educators of health providers, and investigators of diagnostic process and errors. Each of
these activities can add value to health-care delivery by improving quality of care and
reducing overall costs. It is largely up to pathologists to make the case to receive
adequate and appropriate resources at the institutional and national level to support
these activities. Thus, pathologists should be prepared to document the value of these
efforts. As laboratory testing is increasingly centralized and outsourced to reference
laboratory test results, a serious concern is the potential for a perceived lack of need
for such activities by local pathologists. The advantage that local pathologists have is
knowing the local patterns of utilization in their communities, including opportunities
for improvement and direct collaboration with local medical staff as part of the
integrated provider team. Several excellent examples of success have been demonstrated in
both anatomic and clinical pathology. It is noteworthy that the NAM report made a major
recommendation to include pathologists as diagnostic experts, providing a firm basis for
pathologists to assume these roles as fully integrated members of the diagnostic team.83 Finally, pathologists can serve as educators for provider and patients in
point-of-care testing (POCT) such as glucose or international normalized ratio (INR)
testing for self-management of diabetes and warfarin.

Improving Health-Care Outcomes
As noted earlier, the pathology “test” with the longest record for improving safety and
outcomes has been the autopsy. Following the dawn of modern Laboratory Medicine and Anatomic
Pathology in the latter half of the 19th century, the 20th century saw the maturation of
these disciplines as a foundational pillar of modern medicine, with discoveries through
experimental pathology to match. The challenge—and opportunity—for pathology and laboratory
medicine in the 21st century is how the specialty will respond to the promise of precision
medicine and population health.

Fortunately, the clinical laboratory (inclusive of Anatomic Pathology and the diagnostics
of “Precision Medicine”) is ideally placed to help convert health care from “sick care” to
“wellness care.”10 Over the course of an individual’s lifetime, clinical laboratory diagnostics inform
the individual and her or his health-care provider of their wellness status, their potential
risk for developing morbid conditions (acute or chronic), and the actual advent of those
conditions. To the extent that clinical laboratories have comprehensive records on a
regional population, it is precisely those laboratories that can provide leadership in
empowering population health programming to serve that region. In the simplest sense,
laboratory professionals see the diagnostic data first and are the subject matter experts in
test results interpretation and potential application.

In order to play this role, laboratory professionals (medical and technical alike) need
first to look at their own data. In the transactional world of current medicine, the
treating physician orders the diagnostic testing, the clinical laboratory provides the
analytical results, those results are transmitted in atomized fashion back to the treating
physician and her or his clinical care team, and patient management decisions are made on a
one-by-one basis. At the very least, and on behalf of individual patients, the expertise and
resources of the laboratory can be harnessed through diagnostic management teams, as
described earlier. But to convert this expertise to the population level, the laboratory
must provide programmatic leadership. Termed “Clinical Lab 2.0” by the Project Santa Fe Group,10 opportunities include but are not limited toreducing time to diagnosis and time to intervention;

closing gaps in care, as through alerts, notifications, improvements in patient
access, and tracking of clinical outcomes;

powering wellness care screening, including triggering early intervention;

triggering real-time risk escalation and intervention;

laboratory and pharmacy coordination, both for acute conditions (such as antibiotic
stewardship) and chronic disease management; and

building the evidence base for the efficacy and utility of precision medicine,
pharmacogenomics, and interventions instituted at the population level.




These population health leadership activities can play out in both the inpatient and
outpatient settings.85,86
Table 1 provides examples of
laboratory-led population health initiatives, which have provided quantitative evidence of
realized value in improving patient outcomes and the cost of delivering health care.87-92 For those individuals engaged in such projects, the feeling is that we have only
scratched the surface of what is possible in this 21st century.

* Selected recent examples of population health initiatives with measurable,
quantitative outcomes that were led by clinical laboratory personnel, in coordination
with a broad constituency of medical, institutional, and on occasion, commercial
insurer and civic agency stakeholders.

Informatics and emerging data sciences are critical to providing population health and
precision medicine, and it is imperative that laboratory leaders, who manage, understand,
and are the “first to see” the data, are actively engaged with their clinical colleagues and
administrators to make such information actionable. The first priority should be addressing
the needs of stakeholders:
Patients: Laboratory data analytics are essential components of
clinical care management programs designed to improve safety and meet the needs of
patients individually (precision medicine) and regionally (population health). In
addition, most patients frequently access EMR laboratory results in advance of visits
with their providers. Pathologists should explore the opportunity of using this
“patient interface” to directly engage patients and improve population health.


Clinical providers: Laboratory data are necessary to develop
evidence-based decision support tools to improve clinical practice efficiency and
precision, reduce medical errors, manage potential gaps in patient care, and improve
interpretation of laboratory testing.


Institutional quality: Laboratory data inform a substantial portion
of institutional performance metrics, including gaps in care, cost-effectiveness, care
coordination, and appropriate benchmark comparisons.93-95



Institutional finance: Payment systems, especially those that are
value-based, are driven by quality metric ratings across inpatient and ambulatory settings.96 Laboratory data are also key for “risk-adjusting” patients who are members of
managed care plans; failure to properly risk adjust these patients can have strong
negative impact on financial outcomes.97



Payers: Beyond the obligate linkage of data to inform actuarial
analysis and design of health-care plans, the quality and financial metrics mentioned
earlier are key mechanisms by which payers assess the quality of health care being
delivered to their members (patients).


Benefits design: Laboratory data initiatives will become increasingly
important in Benefits Design and Benefits Coverage for managed care and value-based
health plans. The recent National Coverage Decision by the Centers for Medicaid and
Medicare Services (CMS) approved a major molecular diagnostic laboratory for Medicare
coverage, simultaneous with FDA approval of their test offering.98 This joint ruling by CMS and FDA was based on a process which should be kept in
mind by other laboratories seeking to obtain laboratory testing coverage approvals by
payers.




Discussion
We have described 4 major initiative areas that are critical to population health in which
pathologists have the opportunity to provide significant additional value and a leadership
role, but only to the extent and speed that the pathology community is willing and able to
engage. Pharmacists have markedly improved safety and efficacy by actively participating in
clinical rounds, demonstrating the importance of active engagement that should be a model
for pathologists.99-101


A major constraint to all these initiatives is the lack of dedicated funding for the
considerable amount of pathologist and informatics effort that must go into population
health initiatives, even though they improve quality and reduce costs disproportionately to
needed investment.102 Unfortunately, reimbursement policies for tests can drive inappropriate utilization
from both directions (ie, overutilization in a fee-for-service model and underutilization in
a capitated model). However, as pointed out earlier, the test is not the important cost; the
downstream costs are what matter most. Test costs should be tied to processes that put a
premium on getting the most appropriate test at the right time for the right patient and
assuring timely action on these results.

Investments in accurate ordering and interpretation have been limited predominantly to
academic centers102 and large integrated systems with accompanying investments in clinical pathways and
outcomes. The greatest returns in value for the cost of tests are in the processes that
improve patient outcomes and reduced total cost of care. Pathologists are the most
knowledgeable professionals in this arena and should become more actively engaged in
educating payers and hospital administrators that the incremental costs for improving safety
and utilization are small in comparison to potential savings from more efficient total cost
of care.23
83


In addition, pathologists should work with clinical colleagues, health system leaders,
patient advocates, and professional societies to educate federal agencies such as Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
to fund demonstration projects and studies addressing safety and best practices for test
utilization. Pathologists should also seek to work directly with payers to achieve alignment
in managed care program design and execution. Unfortunately, pathologists have not engaged
effectively with these stakeholders, and not surprisingly, these federal agencies have
provided inadequate funding for studying the important impact of test quality and
utilization on reducing diagnostic errors and improving quality.83 Moreover, the number of US pathologists has decreased significantly in both absolute
(−17.5%; 15 568-12 839) and population-adjusted (−23.6%; 5.16-3.94 per 100 000) totals from
2007 to 2017.76 This alarming trend has diminished the ability of pathology and pathologists to help
advance population health and precision medicine and limited their contributions to the
research and education needed to realize these goals.77


Pathologists have broad expertise that impacts the care of patients across all specialties,
which qualify them to be “systems-level” consultants. Some pathologists have acquired the
skills to leverage this expertise to become valued members of the leadership teams of
health-care organizations but more need to assume these roles to help the profession and the
patients being served. Pathology training also should reflect these opportunities and the
value that our profession can bring to health care, important for attracting a new
generation of pathologists. Training should include a focus on data science, drawing on the
rich data sources emanating from pathology and the clinical laboratory. Although
pathologists already have considerable training in the statistical methods used to validate
our analytic processes and in systems thinking as well as operations approaches required to
direct our laboratories, most pathologists report that they would benefit from more
statistics training.103 Training in health systems science should be provided to show how the skills and
knowledge of pathologists can be applied to designing and potentially leading programs to
improve health-care delivery. Likewise, basic principles of public health should be
provided, especially in epidemiology, as it relates to the correlation of test utilization
with population health. Enhanced training in communication and negotiation will also be
important for pathologists to become more engaged with practicing in clinical teams, dealing
with administrators and payers, and educating stakeholders.

The next generation of pathologists must be able to recognize and seek rigorous study
design for comparative effectiveness, manage and utilize summary data for error reduction
studies and control of ordering, introduce alterations to medical records that guide or
steer clinicians to the right test, and communicate the need to change and the consequences
of current trends. Pathology training programs should reach out to other specialties to
train in the laboratory as well as send pathology house staff on rounds to improve test
ordering and management using laboratory test results.104 An understanding of health economics will also be required, as pathologists help to
determine which methods are cost- as well as clinically effective. Training should likewise
emphasize dissemination and implementation sciences (knowledge translation or knowledge
diffusion). Pathology leadership of diagnostic teams, visible beyond the walls of the
laboratory, armed with data, and facilitating changes in the wards, the emergency
department, and the C-suite, will attract the best and brightest of medical students to the
field.

With payers moving to value-based models of compensation, traditional Part B billing and
reimbursement is at risk.105 While pathologists will continue to perform direct patient care services such as
signing out surgical pathology specimens, the inexorable move toward value-based
reimbursement will likely reduce payment for these services, which currently constitute a
major portion of practice revenue. As laboratory test reimbursement likewise shrinks, the
hospital or academic laboratory itself is at risk, which implies that Part A payments also
will be at risk.10,106 The challenge for pathologists will be not only to add value but to also
quantitatively prove to payers and health systems of the value we have added and of their
return on investment for supporting pathologists in these new activities.

Conclusion
The shift from fee-for-service to value-based payment and the implementation of population
health and precision medicine are strong incentives for pathologists to focus on the value
they can bring to patient care. For the profession to thrive, pathologists must focus on
extending their role beyond the laboratory. Pathologists must become critical members of the
health-care provider team as physicians and consultants, with leadership responsibility for
correlating laboratory testing to patient outcomes and error prevention. Pathologists must
leverage their skills and experience to improve quality and cost-effectiveness. Pathologists
must train a new generation of pathologists who understand the role of pathology in
value-based care and precision medicine. Pathologists must engage in health services
research to generate the evidence that supports their value in health-care delivery.
Pathologists must proactively engage in educating other stakeholders, both within and
outside the health-care delivery system, on the value they bring to population health.
Alternatively, if pathologists are unable or unwilling to take advantage of these challenges
and opportunities, pathology likely will be viewed as a cost and liability and will diminish
as a profession.
