Introduction
Although nucleic acid sequencing technology has only existed for about 40 years, the
technology represents an outstanding example of progress resulting from continuous
improvement and increases in cost efficiency. The newest sequencing technologies are
frequently referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results from NGS testing
have been translated into clinical laboratories to produce clinically relevant information
that directly impacts patient care. Some molecular tests employ a “one-gene one-test”
approach by using specific sets of primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect one
specific mutation. In contrast, NGS is able to detect thousands or even hundreds of
thousands of genetic variants in a single test run. This primer is written to provide an
introduction to NGS for those health-care professionals who may have heard of the technology
in the lay press or in grand rounds. While not an exhaustive review, it does lay the
foundation for understanding the power of this innovative technology.

First-Generation DNA Sequencing Technology
After the discovery of the chemical composition of DNA in the late 19th century, nearly 50
years passed before the structure of DNA was eluciated1 and another quarter of a century elapsed prior to developing methods to sequence DNA.2,3 The principal method published in 1977 involves sequencing by synthesis (SBS) of a
radioactively labeled DNA strand complimentary to the interrogated template strand using the
dideoxy chain termination technique. The resulting fragments were then analyzed by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This method, known as Sanger sequencing, became the
basis for the “first-generation” sequencing technology. The original Sanger sequencing
method has subsequently been automated and commercialized.4,5 Major innovations include the introduction of fluorescent-labeled nucleotides instead
of radioactivity,6 replacement of gel electrophoresis with capillary electrophoresis,7,8 and improvement of the DNA polymerases.9 Additional progress was achieved through adoption of molecular biology techniques,
such as recombinant DNA technology10 and the PCR,11 which allowed production and amplification of DNA fragments. The Sanger method-based
sequencing technology was used to sequence a number of increasingly large genomes starting
with bacteria and phages,12–15 and eventually mammalian16,17 and human genomes.18,19


One of the major limitations of Sanger sequencing is that only one sequence reaction can be
analyzed per electrophoresis lane or capillary tube, hence the necessity to divide the DNA
from a biological sample into individual template fragments. This was achieved by randomly
cloning the fragmented DNA from a biological sample (by insertion into vectors,
transformation of the bacteria, and extraction of pure individual fragments from the
resulting colonies). This very labor-intensive process was one of the reasons why the first
human genome project took more than 10 years and cost US$2.7 billion (https://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/). Subsequent improvements allowed
another human genome to be sequenced using the same technology for approximately US$10 million.20


Despite these advances, the efficiency of this method has approached its limit and further
use of this technology was considered time and cost prohibitive. It should be noted that
Sanger sequencing remains the gold standard for confirming DNA sequences due to the
stability of the technology and is still broadly used for targeted re-sequencing in research
and clinical laboratories.

Next-Generation Sequencing
The terms NGS (sometimes subdivided into second- and third-generation sequencing) massively
parallel sequencing or high-throughput sequencing usually refers to technologies that allow
sequencing without the physical separation of individual reactions into separate tubes,
capillaries, or lanes. Instead, the sequencing reactions occur in parallel on a solid
surface (such as glass or beads, depending on the technology) and are only spatially
separated. Thus, billions of sequencing reactions occur and are analyzed simultaneously,
dramatically improving the throughput and decreasing the labor compared to Sanger
sequencing. Regardless of the platform, NGS involves several common steps (see reviews21–23 for details), which are outlined in Figure 1.

specific terms.

Commercialization of Next-Generation Sequencing Technology
These novel approaches introduced early in the 21st century were rapidly adopted resulting
in strong competition in the NGS market. There are several technical differences in the technologies.21–23 A glossary of terms used in molecular biology terms is provided in Table 1.

The first commercial NGS technology was introduced in 2004 by 454 Life Sciences (later
purchased by Roche). This technology24 utilized luminescent detection of a pyrophosphate released upon incorporation of a
correct nucleotide during SBS and produced relatively long sequences (called “reads”). This
technology was used to sequence the genome of James Watson and the price dropped from US$10
million with Sanger sequencing to about US$2 million.25 Within 2 years, other platforms emerged (Illumina/Solexa26 and ABI SOLiD); however, they only produced very short reads. Illumina utilizes an
SBS technology originally developed by a company called Solexa which uses reversibly
terminated fluorescently labeled nucleotides.26 Illumina scientists managed to significantly increase the sequencing read length and
dramatically improve accuracy and throughput. As a result, the costs were decreased and
several protocols were developed for a variety of NGS applications.27,28 More recently, Illumina introduced 2 new instruments, the HiSeq X and NextSeq 500.
The first is able to sequence a human genome at ×30 coverage for less than US$1000,29,30 and the latter does the same for a slightly higher price but in less than 20 hours.
Moreover, a new series of instruments introduced in 2017 (NovaSeq) should reduce the costs
by almost another order of magnitude.

A conceptually different sequencing platform called Ion Torrent31 was introduced in 2011. This SBS technology detects the minute changes in pH caused
by H+ ions released during the incorporation of the correct nucleotide in the
microenvironment around the beads with the attached clonally amplified DNA template
molecules. Consequently, it does not require fluorescently labeled nucleotides and expensive
optics to detect the fluorescence (see the study by Heather and Chain21, Reuter et al22, and Morey et al23 for details). Currently, the most popular applications from this company (now part of
ThermoFisher) are targeted disease panels used in clinical settings (eg, cancer).

In the last decade, the amount of sequencing data has increased exponentially, accelerating
translational research, clinical usage of genomics findings, and development of new genomics
tests to support precision medicine approaches.32,33 Progress in sequencing technologies was also facilitated by the expansion and
adoption of improved molecular biology methods. While early protocols required microgram
quantities of high-quality nucleic acid, now samples with very low (ie, picograms)
quantities of nucleic acid may be sequenced. Sequencing of samples from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded material has become routine. These advances also led to the discovery of
new circulating biomarkers,34,35 a revolution in prenatal diagnostics (genetic testing of fetal DNA from mother’s
blood samples36,37) and single-cell genomics approaches.38–40


Comparison of Ion Torrent and Illumina
Illumina has developed an impressive line of instruments that differ in their productivity,
speed, and price tags from small benchtop sequencers (producing 1.65-7.5 Gb per run) to
production scale systems (producing thousands of Gb of data per run). All these instruments
implement similar chemistry with the sequencing performed by synthesis using reversibly
terminated fluorescently labeled nucleotides and capturing the fluorescent images after each
nucleotide incorporation event. The sequencing data are deconvoluted from the image data
based on the color of the labels.

In the clinical setting, the majority of the existing NGS tests provide a limited amount of
sequence information. MiSeq is an instrument with relatively low productivity which fits the
current need. Depending on the specific test, the instrument may produce from 500 Mb up to
15 Gb of data in 4 to 56 hours. Currently, Illumina produces a validated, Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-regulated custom amplicon kit that enables clinical laboratories to
design custom NGS assays for the FDA-approved MiSeqDx and NextSeq550Dx instruments.

Ion Torrent has 3 instruments in their portfolio. The sequence is determined by measuring
the change in pH in the microenvironment around the beads with the attached clonally
amplified identical template molecules immediately after addition of a nucleotide (one at a
time). There is no definitive stop at each position and the synthesis immediately continues
in case of repeats on the template. The pH change in such cases is stronger than when just 1
nucleotide is incorporated allowing the calculation of the nucleotides in the repeat.
However, this technology is more prone to homopolymer detection and frameshift errors.41 The first instrument by this company, the Personal Genome Machine, is also approved
by the FDA for clinical NGS tests (Ion PGM Dx). This instrument produces up to 2 Gb of
sequencing data (200-400 bp) in 2 to 4 hours. The newer instrument S5 uses the same
sequencing approaches and produces up to 15 Gb data (200-400 bp) in 2- to 4-hour runs. Both
instruments require additional time and instrumentation for library preparation prior to
sequencing.

Currently, Illumina has the largest market share and was the first to obtain FDA approval
for their MiSeq instrument. A comparison of the 2 reveals advantages and disadvantages. The
initial cost of both instruments is similar. The Ion Torrent will generate sequence data
faster than Illumina, an important consideration for a clinical diagnostic test with urgent
requests for results, that is, prenatal samples. The Ion Torrent system offers automated
library preparation, template preparation, and automated chip loading with the purchase of a
separate piece of equipment, the Ion Chef, and does not depend on a technician once the Ion
Chef has been loaded. This should lead to more reproducible results by removing the
variability between technologists. The manual library preparation workflow for the Illumina
occupies the technician’s time and requires considerable molecular biology expertise. The
actual applications for both instruments appear to be comparable and both will perform
targeted resequencing and whole-exome sequencing (WES). The Illumina system has a lower cost
per base of sequence. The FDA-approved Illumina MiSeqDx is able to generate a complete
report for its cystic fibrosis assay, while the Ion Torrent needs manual analysis. An
attractive feature of the Ion Torrent in the cancer field is the ability to generate a
report that matches the sequence results with ongoing clinical trials. While this may be
done with the Illumina data, the report requires third-party software. The S5 is the latest
instrument from Ion Torrent; consequently, there are limited user data for comparison. It
should be noted that the Ion Torrent’s underlying technology has not changed with the
release of the S5. Comparison of the Illumina and Ion Torrent systems has been published in
several articles in areas such as clinical microbiology, germline variant detection, and
prenatal testing as well as somatic variant in oncology. Both platforms performed well and
the results are comparable.42,43


Requirements for Performing Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing
Next-generation sequencing results for clinical purposes have substantially increased the
amount of information available by generating massive amounts of sequence data. As a result,
the overall detection rate of disease-causing alterations has grown significantly.
Next-generation sequencing has allowed the creation of targeted gene panels that will
sequence hundreds of genes at once for less expense compared to the Sanger method or PCR
assays. A clinical setting has many factors to consider in choosing a platform compared to a
research setting. Factors to consider in a clinical laboratory system include specificity
and sensitivity, reproducibility, and analytical accuracy to ensure clinicians receive
accurate results.44,45 Next-generation sequencing technology yields massive amounts of data that require
substantial analysis to produce a clinically relevant, concise result. This analysis
requires appropriate infrastructure including analysis software, data storage, and accessibility.46–48 The report provided to the clinicians needs to be appropriately formatted. For
example, a genetics or oncology report should include the classification of the variant (ie,
pathogenic), literature describing the reportable variant(s), recommendations for further
testing, and for oncology reports, indicate whether the variant is inherited or somatic. The
data analysis usually involves massive genetic, genomic, and oncologic bioinformatics
research and data analyses. Fortunately, there are jointly proposed guidelines from
professional organizations for NGS testing, validation, proficiency testing,42 reporting, and quality assurance/quality control requirements and documentation.49 These articles will help standardize the proper application and interpretation of the
NGS data for clinical utilization. Interested parties should refer to the extensive
documentation in these articles for additional information.

Next-Generation Sequencing for Hereditary Disorders
Next-generation sequencing testing for hereditary disorders faces technical challenges,
data management issues, reporting on incidental findings, and variant interpretation.50 Despite these challenges, NGS has been valuable in identifying the underlying
molecular cause of disorders, especially for those diseases which are genetically
heterogeneous. In addition, NGS has been valuable in the detection of rare variants after
single-gene analysis has been negative or when multigene panels were too labor-intensive and
costly for Sanger sequencing.51 For complex, rare phenotypes, NGS has also been a powerful tool in reducing the
diagnostic odyssey often required to arrive at a diagnosis.52,53 For example, in Usher syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
sensorineural hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction (in a subset of cases),54 NGS has allowed the development of targeted gene panels to survey all causative genes
associated with Usher syndrome. Previously, a comprehensive analysis was limited by the
labor-intensive, high cost of Sanger sequencing and turnaround times. Providing an earlier
diagnosis for children with Usher Syndrome affords the opportunity for earlier medical
management for patients and their families.54


Next-generation sequencing has enabled diagnostic laboratories the ability to offer
targeted disease panels for genetic disorders, such as connective tissue diseases, in
addition to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and WES. For patients with nonspecific clinical
presentations, such as moderate to severe intellectual disability,55 WGS is recommended. The diagnostic rate of WES is approximately 25% to 31%53,56 similar to WGS57; however, WGS has the additional advantage of detecting larger numbers of copy number variations.57,58 Additionally, the reporting of incidental findings, defined as variants unrelated to
the primary medical reason for testing,59 need to be addressed in the context of exome and genome sequencing. The American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics updated their guidelines in 2017 for reporting
incidental or secondary findings in 59 medically actionable genes in which known or expected
pathogenic variants were identified.59 Reporting known (or expected) disease causing mutations in conditions where
preventive measures and/or treatments are available highlight the benefit of returning
incidental findings to patients.59 However, there are also limitations and challenges in identifying and reporting such
findings including the consent process, follow-up diagnostic evaluation, and additional
laboratory resources.51,60,61


Next-Generation Sequencing for Detecting Microbial Organisms
The utility of NGS has been demonstrated for several applications involving pathogen
biology and genomic epidemiology. These include targeted sequencing and unbiased
interrogation of clinical samples for pathogen detection and identification (regardless of
whether the organism can be cultivated or is viable), drug resistance profiling, strain
typing and epidemiological outbreak investigation, microbiome studies, genomic determinant
analysis of microbial functions including metabolism, and comparative ribosomal RNA
phylogenetic studies. Next-generation sequencing brings added throughput, sensitivity, and
informatics-based prowess to pathogen interrogation. It is emerging as a valuable diagnostic
alternative when other methods fail to identify an organism or cannot decipher complex
specimens such as in patients with polymicrobial infections. The use of NGS to detect
evidence of Leptospira in the cerebral spinal fluid of a critically ill
pediatric patient was a landmark case that demonstrated the clinical utility of unbiased NGS
to achieve an actionable diagnostic result when other approaches failed, including
phenotypic, immunologic, and targeted PCR-based assays.62 Also, NGS can perform complete de novo genome sequencing for pathogens not yet fully
characterized, providing reference genomes for further study.63


HIV-1 genotyping for drug resistance prediction is a prototypical example of another value
added by an NGS approach since it is more sensitive than Sanger sequencing and can detect
small percentages of mutant quasi-species of potential importance to clinical management. A
caveat is the technical and informatics challenges associated with authenticating minor
variant calling in these applications.63 There are several challenges for pathogen testing such as separating microbial
nucleic acid from human DNA, library preparation from nonsterile site samples, de novo
sequence assembly of uncharacterized organisms, and assigning clinical significance to
microbial sequences. Microbial profiling by NGS for clinical purposes is currently limited
to laboratories with the expertise and resources to support independently developed assays
since none have yet been commercialized to the extent necessary for widespread adoption.
Several academic and commercial reference laboratories now offer NGS services to
laboratories without the means to employ NGS technology on their own.

Next-generation sequencing can be applied to comparative microbiome characterizations in
healthy and disease states or pre- and postinterventions. Next-generation sequencing
characterization of the intestinal microbiome before and after fecal microbiota transplant
(FMT) in cases of Clostridium difficile colitis has added to our knowledge
of microbiome protection, microbial pathogenesis, and therapeutic efficacy of FMT.63,64 What we learn from NGS studies may create “personalized medicine for infectious
diseases” by informing clinical management options and prognostication.65


Next-generation sequencing utility has been demonstrated for microbial strain typing in
epidemiological outbreak investigations, at least for those involving a limited number of
strains or a single strain. A highly publicized example is the 2011 European shiga-toxin
Escherichia coli outbreak during which NGS provided real-time de novo
characterization of a novel outbreak strain.63,65


Improvements are needed in order to make NGS an effective or adjunct tool for routine use
in clinical microbiology, including commercialized, cost-competitive, user-friendly library
preparation and instrumentation and software, standardized protocols and proficiency
testing, well-curated reference genomes, and regulatory mandates revised to align with
changing technology and practice. As previously mentioned, appropriate improvements in
infrastructure may be required to accommodate the complex data to produce a succinct
clinical report.

Next-Generation Sequencing Applications in Oncology
Next-generation sequencing tests for diagnosing and managing oncology patients have been
used since the technology was utilized to diagnose patients with solid tumors66–68 or hematologic abnormalities.69 The advantage of NGS lies in its ability to conduct large-scale inquiries for many
sequence variants that are comprehensive, inclusive, and sensitive.70,71 Consequently, the technology can actually save costs compared to multiple, individual
nucleic acid-based tests (such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, PCR/sequencing, etc).
The small amount of tissue required may also obviate the need for an additional procedure,
such as a repeat biopsy, to obtain sufficient material for analysis. Older methods required
more nucleic acid which could not be extracted from biopsies, but the smaller amounts of
tissue necessary for NGS may allow successful sequencing of the original biopsy.72 Next-generation sequencing offers clear advantages compared to the traditional
one-gene one-test approach. Germline or somatic variants can be detected by NGS depending on
the goal of testing. Libraries for somatic changes may be created from off-the-shelf panels
or customized for individual types of malignancies. Previously, WGS and WES were not
considered practical for routine clinical use; however, many academic laboratories and
commercial vendors are developing test panels, using several genes or hundreds of genes,73 to detect a variety of genetic/somatic variants in cancers. Testing somatic variants
in tumor specimens requires sequencing at a higher depth (ie, 1000× average coverage) that
is offered by targeted panels, in contrast to germline testing in which a lower sequencing
depth (ie, 30× average coverage) may be undertaken to reliably detect variants.42 To assess the clinical relevance of sequencing results, several determinants are
considered, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, point mutations or single-nucleotide
variants, nucleotide insertions or deletions, gene fusion/rearrangements, and copy number
variations (see Table 1 for
definitions). Next-generation sequencing tests can be DNA or RNA based, or both, depending
on the purpose and design of the test. As the technology matures, test panel costs are
becoming affordable for routine clinical use and are being rapidly deployed in laboratories.
This is especially true in the field of oncology for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as
well as the selection of appropriate therapies.74,75 The NGS tool has become an important part of a personalized medicine approach to
target therapy.

Next-generation sequencing has been used as a molecular diagnostic test for many solid
tissue cancers as well as hematologic malignancies. Test results can be helpful for the
initial diagnosis, tumor classification, determining the origin of the cancer, and prognosis.76
Table 2
77–130 provides a partial list of cancers where NGS information has provided value for
managing patients. Thyroid nodules are a specific example where fine needle aspiration and
cytologic examination may not yield a definitive diagnosis, while NGS has been shown to have
high specificity and sensitivity for cancer detection.77 However, not all patients will derive enough clinical benefit to justify the cost of
using NGS testing and careful test utilization is prudent.

*Partial list of tumors/cancers where NGS has been shown to provide additional
information.

A clear, clinically important use of NGS is to identify the most appropriate therapy for
the individual patient.131 The National Cancer Institute's Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice trial is a good
example of how NGS technology can be utilized in clinical practice.74,75 Despite the promising clinical utility of NGS, the influence of molecular profiling
on individual patient’s targeted therapy has yet to reach its full potential. For example,
the Integrated Molecular Profiling in Advanced Cancers Trial and Community Oncology
Molecular Profiling in Advanced Cancers Trial (IMPACT/COMPACT) trial showed that only 5% of
patients received targeted treatments based on their profiling results.132 While this is a relatively low number, the study did not comprehensively evaluate
factors that may have influenced the targeted therapy. The trial was limited to specimens
obtained many years prior to the molecular testing and did not profile the metastatic
lesions, which may have yielded different molecular profile. Also some of the patients
included in the study were heavily pretreated and were not well enough to receive further
treatment based on the results of molecular testing. Molecular testing also did not include
copy number variation or recurrent translocations, which may have influenced the therapeutic
decision.

With the availability of clinical trials matching drugs targeting specific genetic
alterations, many academic medical centers133 and even larger community hospitals have begun to adopt NGS into their routine
practice. Companion tests for targeted therapy are also in development. Among the current
obstacles, preventing even wider adoption are the initial cost to purchase the instrument
and complex bioinformatics to interpret the sequence data. Recently, commercial laboratories
have entered into this market and competition will ultimately lower the cost and improve the
quality of products. Future development will allow the NGS technology to be more affordable
with wider applications such as cell-free DNA for circulating tumor DNA detection or liquid biopsy.134 These can potentially be used for monitoring disease progression, finding secondary
mutations (such as mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor), minimal residual disease management,135 and occult tumor detection.

Conclusion
Next-generation sequencing has become a widely used technology in the field of pathology.
Several advances have reduced the time and cost of the test, while data analysis has
extended the utility. Routine histopathology and diagnostic work will not be replaced in the
near future, but NGS offers significant advantages in selected cases.
