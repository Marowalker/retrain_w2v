Patient Presentation, Part 1
A 50-year-old man presented to the emergency department reporting extreme, unremitting
abdominal pain of 2 to 3 hours’ duration. Abdominal pain is accompanied by nausea and
nonbloody, nonbilious projectile vomiting. There is no history of diarrhea or constipation.
His past medical history includes diabetes, treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, and
osteoarthritis, for which he takes over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). Physical examination reveals a distressed, febrile patient with elevated
respiratory rate and pulse and a purpuric rash over the extremities. The abdomen is
distended, tense, and tender to palpation, with absent bowel sounds. He received a computed
tomography (CT) scan with oral contrast, a complete blood count, and complete metabolic
panel.

Diagnostic Findings, Part 1
An abdominal CT scan revealed dilated, thin loops of small intestine. Complete blood count
was remarkable for elevated white blood count 18.5 × 109 cells/L (reference
4.3-10.8 × 109 cells/L) and hemoglobin 10 g/dL (reference range: 13.5-16 g/dL).
Serum chemistry was remarkable for hemoglobin A1
c of 7.8% (reference range: <6.5%), glucose of 140 mg/dL (reference range
random: 79-160 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 104 mg/dL (reference range: 5-20 mg/dL),
and creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL (reference range: <1.5 mg/dL).

Questions/Discussion Points, Part 1
What Would You Consider in the Differential Diagnosis for This Patient?
The clinical picture is that of acute abdomen, raising a broad differential diagnosis.
Important considerations include acute appendicitis or pancreatitis, perforated bowel,
such as may be seen in peptic ulcer disease or diverticulitis, intestinal obstruction,
ischemia, and ruptured aortic aneurysm.2 In this case, the imaging showed dilated, thin loops of small intestine. Segmental
dilatation can occur due to interruption of physiological peristalsis and increased
intestinal secretions. These findings are worrisome for bowel ischemia, which could be
secondary to veno-occlusive ischemia as well as strangulating obstruction.3


What Are the Major Causes of Ischemic Injury in the Intestine?
Enterocolic ischemia can result from systemic or local compromises in intestinal blood
flow. Intestinal ischemia is a frequent consequence of reduced cardiac output, as may
result from arrhythmias, heart failure, and shock. Thromboemboli from atherosclerotic
disease and coagulopathies and vascular occlusion from mechanical compromise (eg,
intussusception, volvulus, strangulated hernias) also reduce blood flow to intestinal
segments resulting in ischemia.4 It commonly affects the elderly patients, particularly those with diabetes and
hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients with irritable bowel
syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure requiring
hemodialysis are at increased risk for ischemic colitis.5,6


Ischemic events may be acute or chronic in nature. Chronic ischemia can affect any
intestinal segment and results from etiologies that gradually reduce blood flow to the
intestine. Atherosclerotic disease of mesenteric arteries is a common cause of chronic
intestinal ischemia and is often referred to as chronic mesenteric ischemia. It produces a
clinical syndrome known as intestinal angina, wherein patients experience postprandial
abdominal pain due to insufficient blood flow to the small intestine.7 Acute ischemia results from sudden reductions in intestinal blood flow, which may
be of mechanical, thromboembolic, or hemodynamic etiology.

Systemic vasculitides, autoimmune diseases, and amyloidosis of various etiologies are
also important causes of enterocolic ischemia, as are some infections, particularly those
that affect immunosuppressed populations.8 Iatrogenic ischemia may occur postsurgically; intravascular medical devices are
often coated with polymers that can dislodge and cause downstream ischemic damage.9 Finally, a growing list of medications, including NSAIDs, is implicated in
intestinal ischemia.10 The most common entities and their clinical and histologic features are discussed
subsequently.

What Are the Major Features of the Vascular Anatomy of the Tubal Intestine? Which
Parts of the Bowel Are More Susceptible to Ischemic Injury?
The vascular supply of the tubal gut is summarized in Table 1. The proximal esophagus receives blood from
the inferior thyroidal artery, whereas the mid esophagus derives blood supply from the
bronchial and esophageal branches of the thoracic aorta.11 The distal esophagus and stomach are supplied by branches of the celiac artery with
a rich anastomotic network between branches that prevents ischemic events, with rare exceptions.11,12 On the other hand, the small intestine and colon are susceptible to ischemic
injury. Midgut derivatives, spanning from the ampulla of Vater to splenic flexure of the
colon, are supplied by branches of the superior mesenteric artery.13 These vessels also form overlapping arcades within the mesentery, providing
collateral vascular supply. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies hindgut derivatives
extending from the splenic flexure of the colon to the distal sigmoid colon. This region
of relatively low vascularity (“watershed zone”) near the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid
junction predisposes it to ischemic injury, often due to nonocclusive causes.14 The cloacal derivatives (distal sigmoid colon, rectum colon, and anus) are supplied
by the branches of the internal iliac artery.13

Patient Presentation, Part 2
While in the emergency department, the patient’s condition acutely declines, and he is
taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.

Diagnostic Findings, Part 2
A segment of the distal ileum is resected. The segment appears dusky red to black with a
markedly thin wall and an area of perforation surrounded by fibrinous exudate. The open
specimen shows a sharply demarcated area of black mucosa with loss of the usual folds (Figure 1). Histologic sections are shown
in Figure 2.

Figure 1. A segment of small intestine displays a sharply demarcated zone of ischemic necrosis
(left), typical of arterial insufficiency (gross image).

Figure 2. Ischemic intestinal mucosa displays crypt loss and withered “crypts” with cytoplasmic
depletion. The lamina propria appears hypereosinophilic due to leakage of serum proteins
from injured mucosal blood vessels (A). Other areas contain regenerative crypts with
easily identifiable mitotic figures (arrows; B). Hematoxylin and eosin; original
magnification: ×400 (A-B).

Questions/Discussion Points, Part 2
What Are the Abnormalities Present in Figure 2? Which Type of Histopathologic Changes Are
Depicted in Figure 2A and
B?
Figure 2A shows denudation of the
small intestinal villi and patchy loss of crypts. The remaining crypts have epithelial
cells with attenuated cytoplasm and frequent apoptosis. The lamina propria appears pink
due to leakage of serum proteins from rupture injured vessels. Other areas (Figure 2B) display regenerating,
immature crypts. This is evidenced by lack of specialized (ie, goblet and Paneth cells)
epithelia and frequent mitotic figures. The features are those of acute intestinal
ischemia at different stages of development. Arterial insufficiency, from any cause,
produces sharply demarcated segmental infarction of the intestine, beginning in the
mucosa, which is most vulnerable to hypoxia. Venous insufficiency, on the other hand, is
less common and is marked by mural edema and hemorrhage that ultimately progresses to
necrosis.

What Are the Main Differential Diagnoses at This Point?
The patient’s medical history includes 2 major risk factors for intestinal ischemia,
namely, diabetes and chronic NSAID use. His initial laboratory tests reveal elevated BUN
and creatinine and signs of kidney damage that also portend risk for intestinal ischemia.
On the other hand, the patient presents acutely and in severe pain. Based on the clinical
history, his underlying conditions, including diabetes, arthritis, and renal
insufficiency, are chronic in nature and reasonably well controlled. The discordance
between his overall state of health and the precipitous and severe nature of this episode
raises the possibility of a superimposed vascular compromise.

How Do NSAIDs Cause Intestinal Ischemia? What Other Medications Lead to Intestinal
Ischemia?
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce ischemia by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and
cyclooxygenase-2, thereby preventing prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins normally
regulate smooth muscle contraction in blood vessel walls and prevent clot formation. The
proximal duodenum, ileum, and right colon are most susceptible to NSAID-induced ischemia.
Ischemia is usually localized, but rare, life-threatening bleeding may result from NSAID use.15 Hormone therapies, particularly oral contraceptive pills, induce ischemia by
inducing resistance to intrinsic antithrombotic mechanisms. Cocaine and other recreational
drugs promote vasospasm and induce ischemia. Opioid and antipsychotic medications cause
constipation and bowel distention, exerting direct pressure on mural blood vessels.10


What Histologic Changes Are Present in the Deeper Vessels of the Intestinal Wall
Shown in Figure 3A and 3B?
Deeper in the intestine wall, the medium-sized arteries contain mixed inflammation and
fibrinoid necrosis (Figure 3A).
Other vessels have markedly thickened intima with slit-like residual lumina (Figure 3B).

Figure 3. The medium-sized arteries show mixed inflammation in their walls and areas of
fibrinoid necrosis (arrow; A). More advanced vascular lesions feature intimal
proliferation with near-occlusion of the vessel lumen (B). Hematoxylin and eosin;
original magnification: ×400 (A-B).

How Do These Findings Change the Differential Diagnosis?
These pathologic changes in the mural blood vessels raise the possibility of a systemic
vasculitis as the cause of ischemia. The patient has several other risk factors for
ischemia, as discussed, but these etiologies are not associated with vessel inflammation,
necrosis, or remodeling.

Diagnostic Findings, Part 3
Additional history reveals that the patient had noticed tingling and numbness in his
fingers over the past several months. He does not have any history of autoimmune disorders,
chronic sinusitis, asthma, or recent upper respiratory infection. He also has no history of
malignancy or other serious illness. Serologic tests, including for perinuclear or
cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA and c-ANCA, respectively), were
ordered. On laboratory testing, he is negative for p-ANCA and c-ANCA. In the absence of
immune-mediated causes for his symptoms, possible infectious causes of vasculitis should be
considered, particularly in patient presenting with fever and leukocytosis. This disease
workup revealed positive hepatitis B surface antigen and immunoglobulin G anti-hepatitis B
core, indicating chronic hepatitis B infection.

Questions/Discussion Points, Part 3
What Are the Clinical Manifestations and Histopathologic Findings of Vasculitides
That Affect the Gastrointestinal Tract?
Many systemic vasculitides have gastrointestinal tract manifestations (Table 2). These diseases display
overlapping features and require correlation with serologic findings and other clinical
data for accurate classification. In general, large vessel vasculitides do not involve the
gastrointestinal tract. Medium vessel vasculitides that may have intestinal manifestations
include polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called,
Wegener granulomatosis), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA;
Churg-Strauss syndrome).16 Polyarteritis nodosa is a necrotizing systemic vasculitis that frequently affects
the skin, kidneys, peripheral nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. It may be
idiopathic but is frequently associated with chronic hepatitis B infection.17 Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are commonly positive for c-ANCA.18 Granulomatosis with polyangiitis manifests with cough, hemoptysis, pleuritis, and
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.19 Vasculitis is characterized by vessel wall necrosis and extravascular granulomas.
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is often marked by positive p-ANCA. It
produces chronic allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma.20 The vasculitis features eosinophil-rich infiltrates and occasional granulomas.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that may cause inflammation of
medium-sized vessels of the gastrointestinal tract.

Abbreviations: c-ANCA, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; IgA,

Small vessel vasculitides that involve the gastrointestinal tract include microscopic
polyangiitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein purpura).21 Microscopic polyangiitis is a p-ANCA-associated disorder that causes arthralgias
and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in addition to intestinal ischemia.22 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually affects children and follows upper respiratory
infection, particularly with group A hemolytic Streptococcus spp.
Patients experience a purpuric skin rash, arthralgias, nephritis, and diarrhea. In
addition, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes small vessel inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract.16


What Is the Most Likely Diagnosis?
Absence of ANCAs and respiratory symptoms eliminates the possibilities of granulomatosis
with polyangiitis and EGPA. The patient reports no other systemic symptoms prior to this
episode, making rheumatologic disorders, such as SLE and RA, unlikely. The absence of
recent infection and older age make Henoch-Schonlein purpura unlikely. On the other hand,
neurologic symptoms, serologic evidence of kidney failure, and hepatitis B infection point
to PAN. This diagnosis is also supported by the presence of necrotizing vasculitis of
medium-sized vessels.

Which Other Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders May Manifest as Enterocolic
Ischemia?
Cytomegalovirus
Common patterns of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated enterocolitis range from mild
active inflammatory infiltrate with patchy cryptitis and crypt abscesses to ulcers and
mucosal and mural necrosis. Cytomegalovirus produces both nuclear and cytoplasmic
inclusions in endothelial cells, stromal cells, macrophages, and, rarely, in glandular
epithelial cells. Nuclear inclusions are amphophilic and surrounded by a clear zone,
resulting in an “owl’s eye” appearance, whereas cytoplasmic inclusions are granular and
eosinophilic (Figure 4).23 Cytomegalovirus vasculitis is an uncommon cause of segmental ischemia.
Cytomegalovirus vasculitis features neutrophil-rich vessel wall inflammation,
characteristic inclusions in endothelial cells, and luminal narrowing.24


Figure 4. Cytomegalovirus-associated vasculitis features mixed inflammation in and around
vessel walls. Endothelial cells bearing “owl’s eye” inclusions (arrows) are the key
to the diagnosis. Hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification: ×400.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is a group of Shiga toxin-producing
bacteria, of which E coli O157:H7 is the most common strain.
Enterohemorrhagic E coli shows a predilection for the ascending and
transverse colon and produces mucosal hemorrhage, longitudinal ulcers, and, sometimes,
pseudomembranes. The colonic mucosa shows acute inflammation and superficial hemorrhagic
necrosis with sparing of the deeper compartment (Figure 5). Ischemic injury, evidenced by crypt
“withering” and lamina propria hyalinization, is prominent. Necrosis of small- and
medium-sized blood vessels with intraluminal fibrin thrombi may also be seen.25,26


Figure 5. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection produces ischemic
colitis with crypt loss and lamina propria hyalinization. Prominent mucosal
neutrophils are also characteristic of the infection. Hematoxylin and eosin;
original magnification: ×400.

Angioinvasive fungi
The most common angioinvasive fungi include Aspergillus and
Mucor spp; disseminated infection is typically limited to
immunosuppressed populations.27,28 Aerosolized Aspergillus spores, most commonly
Aspergillus niger, colonize the upper respiratory tract and may
disseminate to the gastrointestinal tract in immunocompromised hosts.27 The bowel wall typically shows ischemic infarction with hyphae emanating from
thrombosed blood vessels in radial arrays. Aspergillus hyphae are
septate, have parallel walls, and branch at acute angles. Fungi in the
Mucorales order have pauciseptate hyphae with irregular walls and
“ribbon-like” folds that branch at random angles (Figure 6). They appear optically clear when
sectioned transversely. The mortality of gastrointestinal infection with these organisms
can reach 50%.23


Figure 6. 
Mucorales organisms migrate through a necrotic
blood vessel wall in this infarcted intestinal segment. They have broad,
pauci-septate hyphae that branch at random angles (shown by large arrows) and appear
optically clear when sectioned transversely (shown by small block arrows).
Hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification: ×400.

Amyloidosis
Systemic amyloidosis results from plasma cell neoplasms, chronic inflammatory
conditions, kidney failure, and hereditary defects in protein folding.29 Amyloidoses that affect the gastrointestinal tract and their parent proteins are
summarized in Table 3.30 Amyloid may deposit in any layer of the intestinal wall, and deposits are usually
asymptomatic. Substantial deposition in tissue in and around blood vessels in the colon
and small intestine leads to ischemia (Figure 7A).31 All forms are morphologically identical and appear as waxy, eosinophilic
extracellular material with artifactual “cracks” (Figure 7B). The material stains positive with Congo
red stains (Figure 7C) and
displays “apple red birefringence” when polarized (Figure 7D). Subtyping of amyloid by standard
histochemical technique is generally not possible, but mass spectrometry techniques may
be helpful.32


Table 3. Systemic Amyloidoses Affecting the Gastrointestinal Tract.

Type of Amyloid	Source	Clinical Condition	
AL	Kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains	Plasma cell myeloma or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia)	
AH	Immunoglobulin heavy chains	Plasma cell dyscrasias	
AA	Serum amyloid A: acute phase reactant	Chronic inflammatory diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever

The vessels are expanded by amyloid deposits, which are deeply eosinophilic in
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains and show a characteristic “cracking” artifact
(B). The deposits stain red with Congo red stains (C) and show “apple green”
birefringence upon polarization (D). H&E (A and B); Congo red (C and D);
original magnifications: ×40 (A), ×400 (B-D).

What Therapies Are Available for Intestinal Ischemia and What Is the
Prognosis?
Most patients with intestinal ischemia are managed conservatively with supportive care
and broad-spectrum antibiotics, although patients with extensive or recurrent disease
require surgical resection.4 Outcomes are heavily influenced by extent of intestinal involvement and hemodynamic instability.33 Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause for patients with systemic disorders.
Systemic inflammatory disorders generally require immunosuppressive therapy, whereas
infections are managed with appropriate antimicrobial agents. Amyloidosis from plasma cell
dyscrasias requires chemotherapy, but treatment options are limited for patients with
hereditary forms of the disease.34,35


Teaching Points
Intestinal ischemia can result from localized or systemic vascular compromise and
preferentially effects intestinal segments with less collateral circulation. The colon
is most commonly affected due to the presence of watershed areas like splenic flexure
and rectosigmoid area.

Intestinal ischemia is a potential complication of commonly used over-the-counter and
prescription medications including NSAIDs and oral contraceptive pills.

Systemic vasculitides (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EGPA, PAN, microscopic
polyangiitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis) and autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA) can present
with intestinal ischemia.

Infections that can cause ischemia (CMV, angioinvasive fungi) are important to
consider, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

Integration of subtle histologic clues and clinical data may elucidate the cause of
intestinal ischemia and guide clinical management in a substantial proportion of
cases.
