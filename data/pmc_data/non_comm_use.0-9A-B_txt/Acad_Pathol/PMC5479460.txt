(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).We retrospectively studied the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) using
immunohistochemical staining in 10 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with
associated perineural invasion. We find that fibroblasts in areas associated with
perineural invasion show higher levels of nuclear YAP compared to fibroblasts in the
stroma of normal mucosa, with a median cell count of 35.4 per high-power field in the
former and 3.9 in the latter. No differences were observed between the expression of YAP
phosphorylated at Ser127 in the tumoral stroma compared to that in the normal mucosa, with
a median cell count expression of 4.9 in the former versus 5.0 in the latter. Therefore, a
strong and increased nuclear YAP expression in fibroblasts associated with perineural
invasion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma suggests that YAP-mediated transcription
programs in these fibroblasts may contribute to perineural invasion.

Introduction
The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the growth and invasive properties of tumors,1 recently reviewed factors contributing to squamous cell carcinoma invasion in the
head and neck including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Fibroblasts within a tumor,
CAFs, are an important component of the tumor stroma, contributing to both the extracellular
matrix (ECM) and the release of growth factors that promote tumor growth and invasion.2–6 YAP is a transcriptional coactivator known to partner with Transcriptional enhancer
associate domain (TEAD) and other transcription factors to regulate gene expression. In
response to Hippo signaling, YAP is phosphorylated at Ser127 (pYAP) and retained in the
cytoplasm by 14-3-3–dependent cytoplasmic sequestration, preventing the activation of
YAP-mediated transcription programs that regulate cell proliferation, cell death, and cell
fate decisions.6,9 Additionally, ECM rigidity, cell tension, and changes in cell geometry activate a
YAP-dependent mechanoresponse independent of Hippo signaling.7,8


Previous studies have shown elevated YAP expression in tumor cells, for example, YAP is
strongly expressed in tumor cell islands in basal cell carcinoma,9,10 but YAP is also expressed in fibroblasts, such as peripheral nerve fibroblasts,11 and YAP has been implicated in lung fibroblast activation and fibrosis.12 Both total and nuclear YAP (nYAP)-increased expression are associated with poor
patient survival in numerous cancers, suggesting that YAP expression may have prognostic value.8 Recent evidence from fibroblasts within mouse mammary tumors at different stages of
progression that show increased nYAP suggests that YAP may have a tumor-promoting role in
fibroblasts within a tumor, in addition to its more established role in epithelial cells.13


In the present study, we investigated the expression of YAP and pYAP in fibroblasts at the
sites of perineural invasion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma compared to
fibroblasts in the stroma of normal mucosa and previous biopsy sites. We find that
fibroblasts in areas associated with perineural invasion show higher levels of nYAP compared
to fibroblasts in the stroma of normal mucosa, suggesting that YAP-mediated transcription
programs in these fibroblasts may contribute to perineural invasion.

Materials and Methods
Tissue Samples
For this initial case series study, we selected 10 cases of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma with perineural invasion from our head and neck cancer database of over 500
cases. The patients were mostly elderly males with a mean age of 71.1 years and a male to
female ratio of 9 to 1. Paraffin blocks were retrieved from the files of the Department of
Pathology at Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New
York. The Institutional Review Board of Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York,
granted us the permission to use clinical information and tissue samples for research
purposes.

All tissues were routinely fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. The
YAP (catalog number 4912) and phospho-YAP (Ser127 catalog number 4911) antibodies are from
Cell Signaling, (Danvers, MA), whereas the secondary antibody Dako Envision+
system–horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer and anti-rabbit and chromogen
3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate kit are from Dako Co. (Carpinteria, CA). The
expressions of YAP and pYAP were assessed in stroma from areas of previous biopsy site
reaction and tumoral stroma.

Immunohistochemical Stain
The paraffin sections were cut at 5 μm thickness and were placed on positively charged
slides. Slides were placed in a 60°C oven for an hour and then deparaffinized and
rehydrated through a series of xylene and graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase was
quenched in 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes. Antigen retrieval was performed
by placing the slides in an Oster (Boca Raton, FL) vegetable steamer with Cell Marque
(Rockline, CA) Trilogy solution for YAP and Dako Target Retrieval Solution for phospho-YAP
(Ser127). The staining procedure was performed in an automatic slide stainer (Dako
Autostainer Plus). The primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies, YAP and phospho-YAP (Ser127),
were applied in a dilution of 1:50 for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by a
secondary antibody for 30 minutes and DAB substrate as chromogen for 10 minutes. Slides
were counterstained with Surgipath (Buffalo Grove, IL) hematoxylin, dehydrated through
graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with Cytoseal 60 from Richard-Allan
Scientific (Waltham, MA).

The staining patterns were classified as cytoplasmic or nuclear, and the staining
intensity was divided into 4 categories—0: no staining, 1+: weakly stained, 2+: moderately
stained, and 3+: strongly stained. Only cells staining as 2+ or 3+ were considered
positive. The number of positive fibroblasts at each site, normal stroma and tumoral
stroma, was determined by counting the total number of positive cells in 5 high-power
fields (HPFs) and calculating the average number of cells per HPF. The median for the
average counts at each site for YAP and pYAP is presented in Table 1. Two pathologists performed the assessment
of YAP and pYAP expression in the benign and tumoral stroma. There was good concordance
between the pathologists, and the results from 1 pathologist are reported in Table 1.

Results
Since YAP has been suggested as a prognostic marker in numerous cancers, YAP expression was
examined with a particular focus on CAFs in the tumoral stroma and areas associated with
perineural invasion using both an antibody that detects total YAP protein as well as an
antibody that specifically detects pYAP.

Analysis of the 10 cases demonstrated CAFs at sites of perineural invasion and in cancer
stroma had a higher number of fibroblasts displaying strong nYAP expression compared to
fibroblasts in areas of benign mucosa. Overall, the median fibroblast count with nYAP
expression was 35.4 cells/HPF in the tumoral stroma, which was nearly 10 times higher than
that found in the benign stroma (3.9 cells/HPF; Table 1). Some pYAP staining was also observed in the
CAFs at sites of perineural invasion and cancer stroma, but the levels were lower than that
of nYAP. In benign squamous stroma associated with previous biopsy site reaction, there were
low levels of fibroblasts with YAP and pYAP staining.

Overall, the expression level of YAP was higher in both CAFs and tumor cells, especially
the nYAP. The pYAP was also seen in both CAFs and tumor cells, but mainly in the cytoplasmic
location. The expression of YAP and pYAP in CAFs at sites of perineural invasion as well as
fibroblasts in the tumoral stroma and benign mucosal stroma are shown (Figures 1 and 2).

Discussion
We studied the expression of YAP and pYAP in the tumoral stroma of CAF, CAF associated with
perineural invasion, and fibroblasts at normal squamous mucosa and previous biopsy sites. We
found that CAF and CAF with perineural invasion had a high YAP expression. It has already
been demonstrated that tumors, especially malignant ones that contain a complex ECM due to
desmoplastic reactions to the tumor cells, increase stiffness of the ECM, which further
enhances tumor invasion and metastasis. The Hippo pathway regulates organ size and
tumorigenesis in Drosophila and mammals and is altered in a variety of human cancers.11,14 In a study of the Hippo pathway in ovarian cancer by Hall and colleagues, the authors
found that the effective YAP, specifically high levels of nYAP or low levels of cytoplasmic
phosphorylated YAP (cpYAP), was associated with poor survival in patients with ovarian
cancer. Consistent with these findings, Steinhardt and colleagues found that nuclear and
cytoplasmic YAP protein expression was significantly higher in carcinoma cells of the colon,
lungs, and ovaries than in their counterpart benign components, indicating active proliferation.15 The study by Yeo and colleagues has reported that YAP and pYAP protein expression was
increased in breast borderline/malignant phyllodes tumor compared to in benign phyllodes tumor16 and found that higher nuclear expression of YAP was associated with worse overall and
disease-free survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Korean population.16 Most studies investigated YAP protein expression in malignant epithelial or stromal
cells. In the study by Calvo et al, the ability of CAFs to promote cancer cell invasion was
also significantly dependent on YAP function, whereas Transcriptional co-activator with
PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) was not required.17 The authors also showed that depletion of YAP reduced the ability of CAFs to form
fibrous collagen networks and promote angiogenesis in vivo, whereas transforming growth
factor β (TGF-β) promoted nuclear accumulation of YAP.13


In our study, we found that high level of nYAP in CAFs is associated with perineural
invasion, with fibroblasts that have a low level of cpYAP expression indicating a more
aggressive pattern of invasion. They also had more extensive desmoplastic stroma composed of
inflammatory cells, which might produce some chemokines, cytokines, and TGF-β,18 which could be involved in accumulating nYAP in the CAFs. In benign mucosa, no to few
fibroblasts are present, and they usually have weak nYAP expression and seem less activated.
Our observation was consistent with the finding by others that YAP with a nuclear location
was critical for CAFs to produce a rigid collagen network that stimulates and promotes tumor
invasion into peripheral nerves.

In conclusion, strong nYAP staining in perineural invasion associated with stromal
fibroblasts in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma suggests that YAP-mediated
transcription programs may contribute to perineural invasion.
