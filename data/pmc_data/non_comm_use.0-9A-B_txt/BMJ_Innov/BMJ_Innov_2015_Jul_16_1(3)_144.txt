In situ simulations are conducted in real clinical environments to allow healthcare teams to practice teamwork and communication, and clinical management skills, in a team's usual work setting with typically available resources and equipment. Such training improves reliability and safety of high-risk situations, allows for experiential learning, and improves the ability to identify and address latent threats and systems issues. Recent programmes and studies have demonstrated that in situ simulations improve unit safety culture, patient outcomes, knowledge, practical skills, communication and team performance, and reduce adverse event costs. Although multiple benefits of in situ simulations exist, support to individual hospitals and units for implementing in situ simulation has been limited.

The purpose of this documentary-style video is to demonstrate how to plan and conduct in situ simulation training, with particular emphasis on how such training can be used to improve communication and teamwork. The video features an in situ simulation conducted at a labour and delivery unit. In addition to instructional content, most of the scenes show unscripted, yet authentic footage, of simulation facilitators and a healthcare team planning, running and debriefing a simulation, and demonstrate the use of visual media during the simulation debriefingâ€”a process that provides a forum for shared learning experiences.

This video will facilitate the implementation and routine use of in situ simulations, as it allows prospective users to visualise techniques difficult to convey in other media forms and training modalities.

The video is part of a toolkit that will become available in late 2016. More information on the toolkit is available on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality website (http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/hais/tools/perinatal-care/index.html).
