Erratum
After publication of the original article [1], it came to the authors’ attention that there were errors in the author list and the affiliations. Francesco Brigo’s surname had been spelled incorrectly, and the department of his affiliation (University of Verona) had been incorrectly specified. These errors have been corrected in the original article.
