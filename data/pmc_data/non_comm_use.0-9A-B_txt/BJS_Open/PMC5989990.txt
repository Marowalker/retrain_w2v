Estimation of the risk of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) of the pancreas is a clinical challenge. Several routinely used clinical factors form the basis of the current consensus guidelines. This study aimed to determine the predictive values of the most commonly assessed risk factors.

Methods
A meta‐analysis of individual risk factors of malignancy in IPMN was performed. Contingency tables were derived from these data, and sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were determined. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves for each factor were calculated and the respective area under the curve (AUC) was assessed.

Results
A total of 3443 studies were screened initially. Analysis of recent literature revealed 60 studies with 13 relevant risk factors including clinical, serological and radiological parameters. The largest area under the HSROC curve was found for weight loss (0·84) and jaundice/raised bilirubin level (0·80), followed by increased carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (0·79) or carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19‐9 (0·78) levels. The most sensitive factors were patient age (71 per cent) and mural nodules (65 per cent), and jaundice/raised bilirubin level (97 per cent) and increased CEA level (95 per cent) were most specific. None of the analysed factors reached a positive or negative level of prediction beyond 90 per cent.

Conclusion
None of the established criteria safely distinguishes malignant from non‐malignant lesions.

Introduction
The clinical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) is still controversial. The major reason is the absence of factors that clearly predict malignancy. To overcome this issue, consensus conferences in Sendai1 and Fukuoka2 have defined combinations of risk factors that may predict malignancy more sensitively and specifically. A large number of mainly single‐centre analyses based on these criteria have been published, but a recent meta‐analysis3 of data from these publications demonstrated that both overall sensitivity and specificity of the most recent (Fukuoka) criteria were relatively low.

The present study aimed to assess the predictive values of individual factors that have been associated with malignancy in IPMN. Studies including branch duct (BD), main duct (MD) and mixed‐type IPMN were considered, focusing on those that reported sensitivity and specificity of individual risk factors of malignancy. Data were pooled and meta‐analysed, allowing for a determination of statistical classifiers.

Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines4 were followed. Two investigators screened two databases, PubMed and Web of Science, independently. In cases of disagreement, a third investigator decided on inclusion of the study. The search strategy consisted of the following terms: ‘intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm’ AND biomarker OR marker OR predictor OR malignancy OR serum OR CA19‐9 OR CEA OR ‘pancreatic enzymes’ OR amylase OR lipase OR PLR OR NLR OR Ca24‐2 OR bilirubin OR platelet OR neutrophil and ‘pancreatic cancer’ AND enzymes OR ‘serum amylase’ OR ‘serum lipase’ OR amylase OR lipase OR ‘serum enzymes’ and ‘cancer AND platelet lymphocyte ratio OR neutrophil lymphocyte ratio’. The search was conducted to cover articles published between 2006 (publication of the Sendai consensus) and April 2016 (date of search).

Criteria for study inclusion were as follows: patients with histologically confirmed IPMN; studies that analysed one or more of the factors of the consensus guidelines or one of the other factors defined in the primary literature search; and studies that allowed for clear assignment of presence of the respective factor to the histological outcome. Invasive carcinoma and high‐grade dysplasia (formerly carcinoma in situ) were considered as malignant lesions.

Articles with abstracts that did not fit the scope of the search were excluded, along with non‐English‐language articles, case reports, small case series with ten or fewer patients, reviews and meta‐analyses. Only studies that allowed for a quantitative analysis of the results into a 2 × 2 contingency table were included in the meta‐analysis.

Studies eligible for inclusion were grouped according to the respective factor of interest. All continuous exposures (for example laboratory parameters such as carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19‐9) were then converted into a binary form using widely used cut‐off values. In the next step, 2 × 2 tables were designed for all studies. Sensitivities, specificities, negative predictive values (NPVs), positive predictive values (PPVs) and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were calculated. Results were pooled using a random‐effects model. Final results for each analysed factor were depicted using forest plots. Heterogeneity was assessed using I
2 statistics. Study quality and publication bias were investigated using funnel plots. The open‐source statistical software R 3.3 and the meta‐analysis package metafor 1.9‐9 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were used for the analysis. The mada 0·5·7 package was used for calculation of the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC).

Results
A total of 3443 studies were screened. Initial screening for markers derived from the differential blood count (neutrophil : lymphocyte ratio, platelet : lymphocyte ratio) revealed poor study quality for these factors, so these studies were excluded. After further exclusion of non‐relevant studies, 60 were included in the final analysis (Fig.  1). Of these studies, 33 investigated mural nodules5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 21 examined dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD)7

Jaundice (26 per cent), thickened cyst wall (23 per cent) and lymphadenopathy (20 per cent) were the least sensitive. Specificity was highest for jaundice (97 per cent), raised CEA level (95 per cent) and thickened cyst wall (95 per cent), and lowest for patient age (59 per cent) and male sex (59 per cent) (Table  
2; Fig. 
S1, supporting information). Jaundice (82 per cent) and lymphadenopathy (71 per cent) had the highest PPVs, and male sex the lowest (26 per cent); NPVs ranged from 86 per cent for male sex to 60 per cent for diabetes mellitus (Fig. 
S1, supporting information).

The pooled DOR was highest for weight loss (8·72), CEA increase (8·37) and jaundice (7·98), and lowest for male sex (2·14) and pancreatitis (2·67) (Table  
2; Figs S2–S4, supporting information).

Analysis of heterogeneity of the included factors revealed low heterogeneity for the majority (below 30 per cent), with moderate heterogeneity (30–60 per cent) for CA19‐9 level, cyst size, lymphadenopathy, dilatation of the MPD and the presence of mural nodules (Table  
2). Funnel plots of study quality are shown in Fig. S5 (supporting information).

Discussion
High reliability in the identification or exclusion of malignancy is an important characteristic of a diagnostic test that is clinically useful in patients with suspected cancer. This meta‐analysis assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a number of established clinical, radiological and serological markers, and revealed that no single clinically established factor (or the absence of such a factor) sufficiently predicted or excluded malignancy. Several factors provided high specificity, but sensitivity was generally poor.

Although it provides a comprehensive overview of all established factors in the stratification of IPMN of the pancreas, this analysis has several limitations. Studies evaluating BD, MD and mixed‐type IPMN were all included. It is conceded that many surgeons would feel that MD IPMN should generally be resected and might wonder why those different entities were investigated in one analysis. Although the dogma that all MD IPMN should be resected is based on an estimated malignancy rate of 61·6 per cent, compared with only 25·5 per cent for BD IPMN2, IPMN with only minimal MD involvement can be followed up safely without surgical intervention in some patients65. On the other hand, BD IPMN with high‐risk signs according to the Fukuoka consensus should be resected2. Future biomarkers might provide safe exclusion of malignancy in MD and BD IPMN. Until such reliable biomarkers have been established, the risk of malignancy in MD IPMN, mixed‐type IPMN and BD IPMN might be estimated incorrectly. The authors chose to include all three subtypes of IPMN of the pancreas to gain a thorough overview of the current literature, although it is accepted that this approach might represent a source of bias. Other limitations include the retrospective nature of most of the included studies, the conversion of continuous variables into binary variables, and heterogeneity of the studies.

The absence of a single valid criterion to predict malignancy leads to the conclusion that several factors need to be combined to identify sufficiently patients likely to benefit from intervention, or observation. The presence or absence of combinations of factors including jaundice, presence of mural nodules, dilatation of the MPD and others might then be used to guide treatment decisions.

The present study did identify factors with relatively high AUCs, such as the presence of increased levels of tumour markers. CEA and CA19‐9 are not included in the recommendations of the current consensus guidelines, but they might be valuable adjuncts where there is diagnostic uncertainty owing to their relatively high specificity. Several potential scoring formulas to improve diagnostic accuracy have been developed over the past decade19
36, 66
67, but none has been validated prospectively.

Until the identification of biomarkers with an adequate ROC curve (such as troponin T for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction), decisions regarding intervention or observation remain largely dependent on the ‘gut feeling’ of treating clinicians. An international prospective study using highly standardized clinical pathways with the collection of high‐quality biomaterial should be undertaken.
