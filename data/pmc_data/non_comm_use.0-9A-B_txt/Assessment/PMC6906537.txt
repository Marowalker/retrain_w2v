deaf or hard of hearing (DHH), while these self-conscious emotions might play a
role in the frequently noted social and behavioral problems in this group.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate the Brief Shame and Guilt
Questionnaire (BSGQ) in DHH children. In addition, we examined associations of
shame and guilt with social anxiety, self-esteem, delinquency, and psychopathic
behaviors. A sum of 225 hearing (Mage = 11.62 years)
and 108 DHH (Mage = 11.82 years) participants
completed the self-report BSGQ. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis
confirmed the two-factor structure (i.e., shame and guilt) of the BSGQ in the
DHH group. Measurement invariance was established across both groups. However,
the DHH group reported lower levels of self-conscious emotions in comparison
with the hearing group. The BSGQ showed good concurrent validity, where shame
was associated with higher levels of social anxiety and lower levels of
self-esteem, and guilt was associated with lower levels of delinquency and
psychopathic behavior in both groups. Future research should investigate the
potential behavioral consequences of lower reported levels of self-conscious
emotions in DHH youth.

==== Body
Shame and guilt occur when failing to meet a certain standard, rule, or goal. Yet shame
relates to an unwanted identity, while guilt emerges when causing harm to someone else
(Olthof, Ferguson, Bloemers,
& Deij, 2004). Consequently, shame is associated with more internalizing
problems, such as social anxiety and low self-esteem (Gruenewald, Kemeny, Aziz, & Fahey, 2004;
Hedman, Strom, Stunkel, &
Mortberg, 2013), while guilt is associated with less externalizing behaviors,
such as delinquency and psychopathy (Huesmann, Eron, & Dubow, 2002; Stuewig & McCloskey, 2005).

The development of shame and guilt depends on opportunities for social and emotional
learning in the context of the social environment (Rieffe, Netten, Broekhof, & Veiga, 2015).
Therefore, these emotions may develop less well in children whose access to the social
environment is limited by communication challenges, such as hearing loss. Deaf and hard
of hearing (DHH) children show more antisocial behaviors than their hearing peers (Coll, Cutler, Thobro, Haas, &
Powell, 2009; Theunissen,
Rieffe, Kouwenberg, et al., 2014; Theunissen, Rieffe, Netten, Briaire, Soede, Schoones,
et al., 2014), and this may be related to lower levels of guilt in this
particular group. Albeit lower levels of shame/guilt are found in a study with DHH
toddlers (Ketelaar, Wiefferink,
Frijns, Broekhof, & Rieffe, 2015), to the best of our knowledge, no
studies have yet examined these emotions and their relations with antisocial behavior
and psychopathology in DHH youth. However, there are no questionnaires available to
assess self-conscious emotions in DHH youth. Therefore, the central aim of this study is
to validate the Brief Shame and Guilt Questionnaire (BSGQ) in DHH children (Novin & Rieffe, 2015).

Shame and Guilt
Shame and guilt belong to a special class of emotions, known as self-conscious
emotions. Both emotions require self-evaluative processes that occur when failing to
meet a certain social standard, rule, or goal (Lewis, 2000; Tracy & Robins, 2004). However, even
though shame and guilt are associated, a broad body of literature has emphasized
that these emotions are distinct in terms of situational antecedents, appraisals
regarding the cause, and subsequent action tendencies (Lewis, 2000; Olthof, Schouten, Kuiper, Stegge, &
Jennekens-Schinkel, 2000).

Shame arises in response to an event in which one makes a negative self-evaluation
and fears being negatively evaluated by important others (Olthof, 2012; Olthof et al., 2004). In the case of shame,
this negative self-evaluation contains a global and stable cause (e.g., “I am an
incompetent person”; Tracy &
Robins, 2006). Shame elicits feelings of worthlessness and an urge to
escape from the evoking social situation, which result in avoidant and withdrawn
behaviors (Lindsay-Hartz,
1984; Tangney &
Dearing, 2002).

Guilt is experienced when an individual feels responsible for harm caused to another
person. In the case of guilt, the accompanying negative self-evaluation focuses on
the specific behavior, which is attributed to a specific and unstable cause (e.g.,
“I did not handle this well”; Tracy & Robins, 2006). Regret over this specific behavior then
motivates the individual to attempt to repair the relationship, for example by
confessing, apologizing, or restoring the situation (Lindsay-Hartz, 1984; Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tangney, Wagner, & Gramzow,
1992).

Consequently, shame and guilt are differently related to various psychological and
behavioral problems. Higher levels of shame involve degrading and devaluing the
self, which promote risk for low self-esteem (Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tangney, Stuewig, Mashek, &
Hastings, 2011). They also involve increased concern about others’
negative judgments, which is also characteristic for individuals with social anxiety
(Fergus, Valentiner,
McGrath, & Jencius, 2010). Yet higher levels of guilt are unrelated
to indices of low self-worth and social withdrawal. Instead, higher levels of guilt
are related to lower levels of externalizing, norm-violating behaviors, like
delinquency and psychopathic behaviors, and help prevent the individual from harming
other people (Rebellon, Manasse,
Agnew, Van Gundy, & Cohn, 2016; Stuewig & McCloskey, 2005).

Shame and Guilt in Children Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing
The distinct contributions of shame and guilt to psychopathology and behavioral
problems have been observed in non-DHH children and adolescents (Ferguson, Stegge, Miller, &
Olsen, 1999; Stuewig
et al., 2015). Yet, to date, the role of self-conscious emotions in the
frequently noted social difficulties and problem behavior of DHH children appears to
have been overlooked (Theunissen, Rieffe, Netten, Briaire, Soede, Schoones, et al., 2014). DHH
children are found to have higher levels of norm-violating behaviors, such as
psychopathy and conduct disorder (Coll et al., 2009; Theunissen, Rieffe, Kouwenberg, et al.,
2014; Theunissen,
Rieffe, Netten, Briaire, Soede, Schoones, et al., 2014).

The vast majority of DHH children are born to hearing parents, and this poses a
challenge to the development of high-quality communication (Marschark & Wauters, 2008). DHH
children not only have fewer means to engage in conversations with their (mainly
hearing) caregivers and peers but they also miss out on overhearing others’
conversations or other kinds of social interactions, resulting in fewer
opportunities for social learning. In turn, this provides DHH children with fewer
opportunities to acquire a proficient emotional competence, including self-conscious
emotions (Rieffe et al.,
2015).

Self-conscious emotions arise in light of social standards and expected negative
evaluations by others. Yet social standards are learnt implicitly, through social
learning, thus more difficult to pick up from a social environment to which one has
less access, as is the case for DHH children. Additionally, DHH children receive
less specific feedback on their own behavior by their caregivers (Rieffe et al., 2015). An
extra disadvantage for DHH children is their impaired Theory of Mind, which is the
ability to take others’ perspectives in daily situations (Ketelaar, Rieffe, Wiefferink, & Frijns,
2012; Netten et al.,
2015), which could hamper the DHH children in anticipating negative
evaluations by others. Taken together, these findings suggest that DHH children have
fewer means for developing a thorough understanding of self-conscious emotions, as
compared with their hearing peers. This supposition is supported by results from one
recent observation study involving DHH toddlers, which found lower levels of shame
and guilt expression in DHH toddlers than in a hearing control group, in response to
shame and guilt inducing events (Ketelaar et al., 2015). But to the best of our knowledge, no other
studies have yet investigated experiences of shame and guilt in the DHH population.
This could be explained by a lack of assessment tools that are appropriate for
measuring shame and guilt in DHH children and adolescents.

Self-Reports Suitable for DHH Children and Adolescents
Administration of self-report questionnaires in DHH children requires several special
considerations. First, DHH children have a higher incidence of language delays
(Marschark & Wauters,
2008), so simple grammar and syntax must be used for each item, to avoid
misinterpretation. Second, item content must be uniformly appropriate for hearing
and DHH children alike. For example, if an item asks participants to imagine that
they failed a foreign language listening test, DHH children would interpret this
differently from hearing children because of the impact of their hearing loss.
Third, the use of hypothetical situations requires less abstract thinking and less
sophisticated linguistic capacities compared with self-reports where participants
are asked to rate the applicability of various statements about their general
tendency to experience certain feelings, cognitions, or behaviors. Therefore,
researchers have advocated the use of scenario-based self-reports to measure and
differentiate shame and guilt in children successfully (e.g., Tangney, 1996). Fourth, although there is
no difference in performance between term-based response scales (i.e., I would feel
not/a little/very guilty) and correlate-based response scales (i.e., I would want to
apologize/my face would turn red; Olthof et al., 2000), DHH children may be
less familiar with the correlate-based responses as these often use symbolic
language. Therefore, the response scale should be term-based. And fifth,
translations in sign language should be made available, since reliabilities for
self-report questionnaires have been found to increase when items are presented in a
child’s native language, or for DHH children in their preferred mode of
communication (Cornes, Rohan,
Napier, & Rey, 2006).

Both the Test of Self-Conscious Affect for Children (Tangney, Wagner, Burggraf, Gramzow, &
Fletcher, 1990) and the Self-Conscious Emotions: Maladaptive and Adaptive
Scale (Stegge & Ferguson,
1994) are widely used self-reports that use a scenario approach. The BSGQ
is a simplified form of the Self-Conscious Emotions: Maladaptive and Adaptive Scale
developed to address the needs of children with language impairments, such as
children with hearing loss, autism, or language disorders (Novin & Rieffe, 2015). It is also
available in Dutch Sign Language. The BSGQ places minimal demands on language
capacities, and consists of 12 short descriptions of shame- or guilt-evoking
scenarios, using simple grammar and syntax (Novin & Rieffe, 2015; see Table 1 for item content).
All items are equally applicable to hearing and DHH children alike. Children are
asked to imagine themselves in a described situation and rate the intensity of their
anticipated feelings of shame or guilt (term-based response scale).

The BSGQ was previously validated in a hearing sample of Dutch children of 9- to
15-year-old children, confirming the two-factor structure and good reliability
(i.e., Cronbach’s alphas: shame = .80, guilt = .78). In addition, the BSGQ showed
good concurrent validity, with shame being uniquely associated with social anxiety
and worry, and guilt being related to lower levels of conduct problems (Novin & Rieffe,
2015).

Given the positive characteristics of the BSGQ, we aimed to validate this self-report
questionnaire in DHH children and adolescents from 9 to 15 years old. It is
characteristic for this period in life that children prefer to spend the majority of
their leisure time with peers (Brown, 2004). A need to belong and to be accepted by peers makes
children more susceptible to social evaluation (Blakemore & Mills, 2014; Somerville, 2013; van Hoorn, van Dijk, Meuwese,
Rieffe, & Crone, 2016). This motivates young adolescents to evaluate
themselves through the eyes of others within social situations, paving the way for
more frequent shame experiences (Reimer, 1996). Children at this age also gain increasing independence,
and are gradually given more freedom. Without constant adult supervision, children
become responsible for their own behavioral decisions (Wray-Lake, Crouter, & McHale, 2010).
But in order to behave prosocially and make the right choices, children need a moral
compass, to overcome the temptation to indulge in self-centered behaviors (e.g.,
stealing money, blaming others for their own mistakes). Feelings of guilt become
increasingly important in this period of life, for the anticipation of guilt can
serve as a motivator to behave according to the social standards (Krettenauer & Eichler,
2006; Lake, Lane,
& Harris, 1995; Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007).

The BSGQ is appropriate for measuring shame and guilt in children between 9 and 15
years old because children are the best informants on their own internal feelings
states and they can meaningfully and reliably report them from the age of 8 years
(Berti, Garattoni, &
Venturini, 2000; Ferguson & Stegge, 1995). In addition, children older than 9 years
are able to discriminate shame and guilt accurately (Olthof et al., 2000). To optimize
suitability for DHH children, we provided a video translation in sign language for
each item.

The Present Study
The central goal of this study was to examine the extent to which the BSGQ could
successfully measure shame and guilt in a sample of DHH children and whether results
from DHH children obtained on the BSGQ could be meaningfully compared with those of
their hearing peers. To achieve this goal, we evaluated construct and concurrent
validity. To examine the construct validity, we first assessed the hypothesized
two-factor structure (i.e., shame and guilt) across both DHH and hearing children.
Second, we assessed the reliability of the shame and guilt scales for each group
separately. In the event that measurement invariance was established, we compared
levels of shame and guilt between DHH and hearing participants. We predicted that
DHH children would report lower levels of shame and guilt compared with their
hearing peers, since a previous study indicated DHH children express less shame and
guilt (Ketelaar et al.,
2015) and DHH children are known to experience greater difficulty
appreciating other people’s perspectives (Ketelaar et al., 2012; Netten et al., 2015; Rieffe, Dirks, van Vlerken, &
Veiga, 2017).

To evaluate the concurrent validity of the BSGQ, children completed self-report
questionnaires regarding social anxiety, self-esteem, and delinquency. Parents
reported on their children’s levels of psychopathic behaviors. We predicted that
higher levels of shame would be associated with more symptoms of social anxiety
(Fergus et al., 2010)
and lower self-esteem (Tangney
et al., 2011), and we expected that higher levels of guilt would be
associated with lower levels of delinquency and psychopathic behaviors (Huesmann et al., 2002;
Stuewig & McCloskey,
2005; Tangney,
Stuewig, & Martinez, 2014). We expected that these relationships
would not differ between DHH and hearing children.

Method
Participants
Participants consisted of 225 hearing children (Mage
= 11.62 years, SD = 1.37, 42.2% boys) and 108 DHH children
(Mage = 11.82 years, SD = 1.46,
46.3% boys) between 9 and 15 years old. Independent t tests
indicated that the hearing and DHH group did not differ in age,
t(331) = −1.22, p = .223, intelligence,
t(298) = 1.05, p = .293, and socioeconomic
status, t(249) = .73, p = .469. In addition, a
chi-square analysis revealed no differences in gender distribution,
χ2(1, N = 333) = .49, p =
.483.

DHH children were recruited through the distribution of leaflets about the study,
which indicated a website where parents could go to register if children wanted
to participate. Distribution of the leaflets took place at (a) ENT departments
of hospitals, (b) speech and hearing centres, (c) special-needs schools
providing education to DHH students, and (d) magazines and websites for the
target population. All DHH participants were born to hearing parents. Hearing
children were recruited from mainstream primary and secondary schools. Inclusion
criteria for both groups were (a) no diagnosed developmental disabilities or
learning difficulties, such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and/or dyslexia;
(b) normal intellectual functioning; and (c) living in the Netherlands or the
Dutch speaking part of Belgium. In addition, DHH children were only included if
they had an unaided hearing loss of at least 40 dB in both ears (i.e., moderate
hearing loss) that was detected prelingually or perilingually. This criteria of
>40 dB hearing loss is a standard set by the World Health Organization, and
indicates an individual has frequent difficulties hearing normal speech, even at
close distances. The Ethics committee of Leiden University granted permission
for the study and all primary caregivers gave written consent before
testing.

Materials
Intelligence and Socioeconomic Status
Nonverbal intelligence was assessed using two subscales of
the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Third edition (Wechsler, 1991). In
the first subtest, Block Design, children were given red and white colored
square blocks and asked to arrange them to form geometric designs presented
by the test leader in a two-dimensional image. In the second subtest,
Picture Arrangement, children were given the task of arranging cartoon
pictures from left to right in chronological order. Raw scores for both
subtests were converted to norm scores corrected for age. The mean score of
these two norm scores was used to examine group differences (see
participants).

Socioeconomic status was assessed by requesting that parents
indicate maternal and paternal educational level (1 = no/primary education,
2 = lower general secondary education, 3 = higher general secondary
education, 4 = college/university) and net household income (1 ≤ €15,000, 2
= €15,000-€30,000, 3 = €30,000-€ 45,000, 4 = €45,000-€60,000, 5 ≥ €60,000).
Net household income was converted to a 4-point scale, and a mean score was
calculated based on these three indicators. The mean score was used to
examine group differences on socioeconomic status.

Questionnaires
The BSGQ for Children (Novin & Rieffe, 2015) consists
of 12 emotion-eliciting scenarios. Children were instructed to imagine
themselves being in a described scenario and asked to rate how ashamed or
guilty they would feel on a 3-point scale (1 = not at all,
2 = a little, 3 = a lot). Six scenarios
were designed to describe behaviors that would cause harm to another and
elicit guilt (e.g., “There is one biscuit left in the biscuit tin. You
quickly put it in your mouth. Now your friend does not have a biscuit”), and
six vignettes were designed to describe incompetent behavior in the presence
of others without causing any harm to another and elicit shame (e.g., “You
get a very bad grade in school”). The content of the items is presented in
Table 1.
Mean scores were calculated per scale.

The Social Anxiety Questionnaire (Theunissen et al., 2012) consists
of six descriptions of socially charged situations, such as “talking to
someone I don’t know” and “entering a room with strangers.” Children were
asked to report the intensity of their fear for the described situation (1 =
no fear, 2 = a little fearful, 3 =
a lot of fear). Data of 1 DHH child (<.01%) is
missing due to a computer failure in administering this questionnaire. The
internal consistency of this questionnaire was rated as good (see Table 2).

Behavioral Problems.

Note. H = hearing; DHH = deaf or hard of
hearing.

To assess children’s global self-esteem, we used the
corresponding scale of the Children’s Self-Confidence and Acceptance
Scale (Rieffe et al., 2007; Theunissen, Rieffe, Netten, Briaire,
Soede, Kouwenberg, et al., 2014). Children were asked to consider
how well five general statements, concerning the self, applied to them
(e.g., “I like myself”), and to rate each one on a 3-point scale (1 =
not true, 2 = sometimes true, 3 =
often true). Data were missing for five DHH children
(4.6%) due to a computer failure in administering this questionnaire. The
internal consistency of this scale was rated as sufficient (see Table 2).

The Delinquency Questionnaire (Baerveldt, Van Rossem, & Vermande,
2003; Theunissen, Rieffe, Kouwenberg, et al., 2014) is a self-report
measure that includes statements about 10 minor delinquent offences (e.g.,
“I stole money from my parents”). Children were asked to report their
engagement in these behaviors according to a 3-point scale: 1 =
never, 2 = once or twice, 3 =
three times or more. This questionnaire was rated as
showing undesirable to reasonable reliability (see Table 2).

The Psychopathy Screening Device (Frick, Obrien, Wootton, & Mcburnett,
1994; Theunissen, Rieffe, Kouwenberg, et al., 2014) is a parent
questionnaire that measures psychopathic behaviors of the child (e.g., the
child blames others for his or her mistakes). Parents were asked to rate how
much the statements applied to their child (1 = not true, 2
= sometimes true, 3 = certainly true).
Parents of 20 DHH children (18.5%) and 50 hearing children (22.2%) did not
complete or return the questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire
was rated as good (see Table 2).

Of the 259 completed Psychopathy Screening Devices, 196 were completed by the
mother (74.5%), 37 by the father (14.1%), 16 by mother and father together
(6.1%), and 1 by an older brother (.4%). For 13 questionnaires, the
respondent was unknown. A one-way analysis of variance, including the three
main respondent groups (i.e., mother, father, both) indicated no effect for
the type of respondent on the psychopathy measure, F(2,
248) = .21, p = .935.

Procedure
Self-report questionnaires were administered to children individually in a quiet
room at their home or school. Children were seated in front of a computer screen
and assured that all answers would be kept confidential and processed
anonymously. To ensure the questionnaires would be appropriate for DHH children,
only questionnaires were selected that were previously used in this population
and in which no complex grammar was used (Theunissen et al., 2012; Theunissen, Rieffe,
Kouwenberg, et al., 2014; Theunissen, Rieffe, Netten, Briaire, Soede,
Kouwenberg, et al., 2014). For all participants, questions were
presented one by one on the computer screen. Administration of the questionnaire
was uniform between groups, except DHH participants also viewed a video clip in
which a sign language interpreter provided a translation. DHH participants could
repeat these video clips as often as desired. During administration of the
questionnaires, a test leader was present for both hearing and DHH children to
answer possible questions from participants. DHH children were only tested by
test leaders who were proficient in sign language. No questions were asked
regarding item content of the BSGQ. All children were given a small present (a
comic book) after filling out the questionnaires to thank them for their
participation.

Parents were sent (electronic) mail with the Psychopathy Screening Device and
questions about their socioeconomic status. Parents were requested to return the
questionnaires within 2 weeks after their child’s test session.

Statistical Analyses
To evaluate the underlying factorial structure, confirmatory factor analyses
(CFAs) were conducted in R version 3.2.1 using packages lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) and
semTools (semTools
Contributors, 2015). To take into account the categorical nature of
our indicators, robust mean- and variance-adjusted weighted least-squares
estimation was used (Finney
& DiStefano, 2013). This estimation technique performs adequately
in small samples and little bias occurs in case of multivariate nonnormality
(Flora & Curran,
2004).

The hypothesized two-factor model was tested with a CFA for the hearing and DHH
group separately (see Figure
1). To test for measurement invariance of the BSGQ across both
groups, we performed several multigroup CFA models. First, we examined the
hypothesized model simultaneously in both groups without constraints. This
so-called configural model indicates whether overall model
structure is similar across groups (Jöreskog, 1971). Second, we tested for
metric invariance by constraining factor loadings, so they
were the same across groups. Metric invariance assumes that each item is
interpreted and responded to in the same way by the respondents. Third, we
tested for scalar invariance by constraining intercepts equal
across groups. Scalar invariance assumes individuals with the same actual level
of shame/guilt would report identical on related items in the questionnaire,
regardless of their hearing status (Byrne, 2006, 2008; Milfont & Fischer, 2010; Vandenberg & Lance,
2000).

Note. DHH = deaf or hard of hearing; BSGQ = Brief Shame
and Guilt Questionnaire; E = error variance.

Model fit was assessed using the χ2/df ratio. Kline (2005) argues
that a ratio of less than 3:1 indicates good model fit. In addition, the
comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI) and the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) were reported. CFI and TLI values above
.90 indicate acceptable fit and values above .95 represent good fit (Hu & Bentler,
1999). For RMSEA, values below .05 suggest good fit and values up to .08
indicate reasonable model fit (Browne & Cudeck, 1989). Measurement
invariance was evaluated comparing the nested models using Δχ2 and
ΔCFI with a cutoff point of <0.005 (Byrne, 2006; Chen, 2007).

Reliability analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS version 23. Internal consistency
reliabilities for the BSGQ were examined using Cronbach’s alpha. The following
ranges for evaluating Cronbach’s alpha were used: <.60 is unacceptable; ≥.60
is undesirable; >.65 is minimally acceptable, >.70 is good; and >.80 is
very good (DeVellis,
2003). In addition, average interitem correlations were calculated.
According to Clark and Watson
(1995), average interitem correlations should fall within a .15 to
.50 range.

To test whether DHH children differed from hearing children in levels of shame
and guilt, Mann–Whitney U tests were conducted. In addition,
r was reported as an index for effect size for which an
effect size of .10 is considered small, ≥.30 is medium, and ≥.50 is large (Rosenthal, 1991).

Concurrent validity was evaluated using Spearman rank order correlation
coefficients to assess links of shame and guilt with delinquency, psychopathic
behaviors, social anxiety, and self-esteem. In addition, we assessed these links
using partial correlations in which the other self-conscious emotion was
controlled for. To find out whether correlations differed in strength between
hearing and DHH participants, Fisher r-to-z
transformations were carried out.

Results
Construct Validity
The hypothesized two-factor model resulted in adequate to good fit indices in
both the hearing group, χ2/df = 1.97, CFI = .954,
TLI = .943, RMSEA = .066, and the DHH group, χ2/df =
1.45, CFI = .975, TLI = .969, RMSEA = .065. Standardized factor loadings ranged
from .343 to .942 (see Table 1). The correlation between shame and guilt was .72 for the
hearing group and .77 for the DHH group.

The configural model confirmed that the hypothesized model fits well in both
groups, χ2/df = 1.69, CFI = .965, TLI = .956, and
RMSEA = .065. Testing metric invariance did not yield a significantly higher
χ2 value compared with the configural model, p =
.208. Moreover, the ΔCFI decreased .002 points providing support for full metric
invariance (see Table
3). Testing scalar invariance did not result in a substantial
increase in the χ2 value, p = .396. In addition, a
ΔCFI value of less than .001 indicated that constraining intercepts did not lead
to a decrease in model fit. Therefore, full scalar invariance can be assumed
(see Table 3).

Group Differences
The mean scores and standard deviations of the BSGQ are shown in Table 4. Levels of
guilt and shame were compared between the hearing and DHH group with two
Mann–Whitney U tests. DHH children reported lower levels of
shame and guilt, as compared with their hearing peers (U =
10029, z = −2.59, p = .010, r
= .14, and, U = 8914.5, z = −3.96,
p < .001, r = −.22, respectively).

Concurrent Validity
Table 5 shows the
outcomes of the correlations of shame and guilt with social anxiety,
self-esteem, delinquency, and psychopathic behaviors as dependent variables.
Outcomes indicate shame correlated positively with social anxiety,
r(332) = .39, p < .001, and negatively
with self-esteem, r(328) = −.13, p = .021,
including when guilt was controlled for, r(332) = .31,
p < .001, and r(328) = −.15,
p = .006, respectively. Shame was unrelated to delinquency,
r(333) = −.02, p = .789, and psychopathic
behaviors, r(263) = −.01, p = .905.

In addition, guilt was positively correlated with higher levels of social
anxiety, r(332) = .27, p < .001, lower
levels of delinquency, r(333) = −.18, p =
.001, and psychopathic behaviors, r(333) = −.15,
p = .013. However, guilt was unrelated to self-esteem,
r(328) = .01, p = .915. After controlling
for shame, the negative correlation of guilt with delinquency,
r(333) = −.20, p < .001, and
psychopathic behaviors, r(263) = −.17, p =
.005, remained. However, guilt was no longer found to be associated with social
anxiety, r(332) = .09, p = .104.

We tested for group differences in the strength of correlations between shame and
guilt with social anxiety, self-esteem, delinquency, and psychopathic behaviors.
Using Fisher r-to-z transformation, a
z value score was calculated to assess whether the
correlation coefficients differed between hearing and DHH children. The strength
of these relationships did not differ between hearing and DHH children.
Therefore, only the overall correlations (where both groups were combined) are
displayed in Table
5.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to validate the self-report BSGQ for DHH children.
While administration of self-report questionnaires in DHH children contains many
challenges due to the impact of hearing loss on language development and
communication, we found full support for the two-factor model with shame and guilt
as separate constructs in both the DHH and hearing group. Shame and guilt can be
successfully measured in DHH children by using the BSGQ, and their scores on the
BSGQ can be reliably compared with those of hearing children. Since children were
asked to rate the intensity of their anticipated shame and guilt experiences, these
results indicated that DHH children were as able as hearing children to distinguish
between shame and guilt verbally. In addition, the reliabilities for both the shame
and guilt scales for the DHH children were rated as very good or good (i.e., .83 and
.79, respectively). These positive results for construct validity and the
psychometric properties of the BSGQ in DHH children could be achieved based on
simple item content formulation and the availability of video clips with a sign
language interpretation. The video clips were frequently accessed by DHH children
who indicated sign language as their preferred mode of communication. We recommend
this procedure for developing questionnaires for DHH children who prefer sign
language, because they can be tested in a standardized manner while minimizing risk
that they will misinterpret item content (Enns & Herman, 2011). However, since we
did not test the effectivity of the video clips in sign language for the DHH
population directly, this could be tested in a follow-up study.

Notably, DHH children reported lower levels of shame and guilt compared with their
hearing peers. Self-conscious emotions fulfill a key social function by motivating a
broad range of appropriate behaviors (Giner-Sorolla, 2012). Therefore, a lower
intensity in the experience of these particular emotions may have detrimental
effects on children’s social and emotional development and functioning. Maintaining
relationships could be more challenging for those who experience less guilt. If one
does not experience guilt after harming another, one will be less inclined to
display reparative behaviors such as apologizing or helping repair damage (Lindsay-Hartz, 1984; Tangney & Dearing,
2002). Expression of guilt provides the receiver with crucial information as
it reflects awareness of the harm done, and intention to avoid repeating that
behavior in the future. This makes it easier to forgive the other for the
misconduct, and helps reinstate the relationship (Giner-Sorolla, 2012). Lower levels of guilt
provide less motivation to display appropriate behaviors (Krettenauer & Eichler, 2006; Lake et al., 1995), and
lower levels of guilt found in DHH children may explain the higher incidence of
problem behaviors in DHH adolescents (Coll et al., 2009; Theunissen, Rieffe, Kouwenberg, et al.,
2014; Theunissen,
Rieffe, Netten, Briaire, Soede, Schoones, et al., 2014). Clearly, more
research is needed to understand the implications of lower levels of reported shame
and guilt for social–emotional abilities and problem behaviors in DHH children.
Validation of the BSGQ in DHH children makes it possible to begin to study these
interrelationships in this population now.

Shame is an overwhelming emotion accompanied by a negative evaluation about the
global self, causing individuals to feel incompetent and bad about themselves (Lewis, 2000; Tangney et al., 1992). As
expected, we found that children with higher levels of shame had lower self-esteem
and more social anxiety. Although guilt was also related to more social anxiety,
this association disappeared when we controlled for shame, which aligns with other
studies (Gilbert, 2000;
Hedman et al., 2013).
While we stressed that shame and guilt have distinct features, they also share core
characteristics. This is illustrated by the positive correlation we found between
shame and guilt (i.e., correlation = .55; p < .001), which is
congruent with other studies (Olthof, 2012; Tangney et al., 1992). Previous studies have emphasized the need to
control for the shared variance between shame- and guilt-proneness in assessing its
relationship with emotional functioning (Spruit, Schalkwijk, Vugt, & Stams,
2016). Future studies could more closely examine the extent to which
covariance in shame and guilt affect predictive value for behavioral measures.

Guilt discourages socially inappropriate behavior, and this claim is supported in
this study by associations of higher levels of guilt with lower levels of
delinquency and psychopathy. This aligns with previous studies stressing the
adaptive function of “shame-free” guilt (Spruit et al., 2016). In contrast, the
relation between shame and delinquent behavior has been debated in the literature.
Some claim that shame is a painful emotion that occurs in light of a transgression
and motivates people to prevent experiencing this emotion in the future, and as
such, shame inhibits antisocial behaviors (Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tangney et al., 2007).
Others claim that the pain of shame causes individuals to externalize blame, to
regain a sense of control over their situation. This has been related to
externalizing behaviors, such as aggression and delinquency (Spruit et al., 2016; Stuewig, Tangney, Heigel, Harty, & McCloskey,
2010). In a recent meta-analysis, Spruit et al. (2016) found evidence for
neither an inciting nor inhibiting role for shame in delinquent behaviors, while
guilt was related to less delinquency. This aligns with our findings, as shame was
found to be unrelated to both psychopathy and delinquency, whereas guilt was
negatively correlated with both norm-violating behaviors.

This study does have several limitations that need to be addressed. First, the
internal consistencies of two scales were lower than the expected value of .70
(i.e., for self-esteem in both groups and delinquency in the DHH group). For this
validation study, it was important to select questionnaires that had been used
previously in a DHH population, and could show the unique contribution of
self-conscious emotions to social–emotional functioning and problem behaviors. This
resulted in limited options, stressing that more validation studies for instruments
addressing this particular population are needed. Moreover, existing questionnaires
may benefit from additional items. This is especially true for the self-esteem
scale, which consisted of only five items. These could be developed in future
studies. Nevertheless, we did find the predicted relationships for shame and guilt
using these questionnaires. Second, our sample consisted of hearing and DHH with
average intelligence and no diagnosed developmental disabilities. Our results can
therefore not be generalized to children with intelligence below the normal range or
with a diagnosed disability (e.g., attention hyperactivity disorder or autism
spectrum disorder). Third, common method variance probably influenced our study
results. On the one hand, this could have inflated correlations between the study
variables (e.g., self-reports with a 3-point scale), while a difference in response
format (i.e., how guilty/ashamed do you feel?) could cause a differentiation between
shame and guilt based on the measurement method rather than the underlying
constructs. However, in this study, the relations of shame and guilt with social
anxiety, self-esteem, and delinquency were congruent with prior studies. In addition
to self-reports, we also assessed psychopathy through parent report, minimizing the
likelihood of common method variance. The relations of psychopathy with shame- and
guilt-proneness were also consistent with prior studies (Tangney et al., 2007). Fourth, there can be
a considerable overlap in shame and guilt regarding guilt-evoking situations, which
cannot be completely ruled out in our measure. Future studies could also take this
into account by controlling for shame also in the guilt-evoking situations and vice
versa. Fifth, the data gathered in this study are all correlational. This makes it
impossible to draw conclusions about causal relationships. Sixth, we did not test
convergent validity between the BSGQ and other validated measures of shame and
guilt.

Future studies could attempt to discover and analyze the longitudinal relationships
between self-conscious emotions and the social and behavioral difficulties in DHH
adolescents. The BSGQ could be used to track the development of shame and guilt in
DHH individuals from late childhood to middle adolescence, a period in which the
anticipation of shame and guilt experiences are known to influence behavior choices
(Olthof, 2012; Stuewig et al., 2015). In
addition, the questionnaire could help determine whether a lower intensity of guilt
contributes to a heightened level of proactive aggression or problems in maintaining
friendships in DHH children (Gilman, Easterbrooks, & Frey, 2004; Keilmann, Limberger, & Mann, 2007;
Theunissen, Rieffe,
Kouwenberg, et al., 2014; Wolters, Knoors, Cillessen, & Verhoeven,
2011). The role of shame in the development of psychopathology is not yet
clear. Although shame does seem to contribute to more internalizing symptoms (Gruenewald et al., 2004;
Tangney et al.,
1992), the protective role in the development of antisocial behaviors cannot
be confirmed in this study (Olthof, 2012). Future research could further examine the longitudinal
relationships between these variables to further unravel the protective or possible
harmful effect of shame. Validation of the BSGQ in DHH adolescents paves the way for
future studies to begin to unravel the mystery of the role of self-conscious emotion
in the social and emotional development of DHH adolescents.
