Short
pieces of fused silica capillary tubing were used to support
an electrified liquid–liquid interface. A methyl deactivated
silica capillary having a diameter of 25 μm was filled with
1,2-dichloroethane solution and served as the organic part of the
liquid–liquid interface. A nondeactivated fused silica capillary
having a diameter of 5, 10, or 25 μm was filled with an aqueous
HCl solution and served as the aqueous part of the electrochemical
cell. For the latter, silanization of the capillary interior with
chlorotrimethylsilane allowed for a successful phase reversal. All
capillaries were characterized by ion transfer voltammetry using tetramethylammonium
cation as a model ion. This simple, fast, and low-cost miniaturization
technique was successfully applied for detection of the antibiotic
ofloxacin.

Electrochemical
sensing at the
interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) is
not restricted to oxidation/reduction reactions but can also arise
from ionic currents traversing the immiscible junction.1−3 Such a unique property can be extended to detect molecules which
are considered as nonactive or difficult to detect at conventional
solid electrodes.4 Moreover, the potential
depended partitioning of ions is directly related to their chemical
structure and hence opens new avenues for their selective discrimination.
ITIES is a self-healing, renewable, and defect-free system that holds
discontinuous properties and can also be modified giving interfacial
region tuned properties.5 A number of benefits
arise from the interfacial miniaturization: (i) low chemicals consumption,
(ii) lower limits of detection as a consequence of the smaller capacitive
currents, (iii) higher sensitivities due to an enhanced mass transfer
governed by hemispherical diffusion zones, or (iv) small iR drop which permits the measurements in low conductance media. Consequently,
significant effort was devoted to ITIES miniaturization.6,7 Ordered hexagonal arrays of nanopores8−10 or micropores11,12 were prepared in properly engineered silicon-based materials using
etching, deposition, and patterning lithography methods. In some cases,
ITIES was supported with ex situ or in situ prepared mesoporous membranes.3,13,14 Commonly used methodology for nano- or microITIES preparation covers
single15−17 or double barrel18 capillary
pulling followed by its interior (adapted to the organic phase) or
exterior (adapted to the aqueous phase) surface silanization. Laser
ablation is another method allowing for patterned membrane preparation.
So far, it was used to prepare a single micropore in polymeric films,19 arrays of micropores in a thin glass,20 or polymeric sheets.21 An alternative approach for the interfacial miniaturization is based
on a metal wire templating method,22−25 where a short piece of microwire
(usually with a diameter in the range of 5–50 μm) is
sealed in glass. Subsequently, the (templating) wire is dissolved
in aqua regia, leaving the micropore that can be
used to support ITIES.

In this study, we present a simple, low-cost,
and very fast method
for ITIES miniaturization in a form of a single pore capillary having
5, 10, or 25 μm in diameter. The protocol of micropore-ITIES
preparation is described in detail in the Supporting Information. Briefly, a piece of fused silica capillary tubing
is firmly melted into a micropipet tip. The excess of the silica capillary
is then removed with a ceramic knife, leaving a short piece with a
length up to around 500 μm. In Figure 1 are shown SEM micrographs of capillaries
with all available dimensions: 25 μm in diameter methyl terminated
(methyl-deactivated) pore walls (Figure 1A) and 25 μm (Figure 1B), 10 μm (Figure 1C), and 5 μm (Figure 1D) silanol groups (nondeactivated) terminated
pore walls. It was expected that the very basic and fast preparation
method, namely, manual cuts with a ceramic knife, will manifest itself
as a slight capillary deformation. The cut mark can be especially
visualized in Figure 1B,D. Nevertheless, it is clear that each micropore lumen is still
within the expected dimensions and can be used to support the ITIES.

cut with a ceramic knife: (A) 25 μm in diameter methyl deactivated
silica microtubing; (B, C, and D) 25, 10, and 5 μm in diameter
nondeactivated silica microtubing, respectively. Inserts correspond
to zoom in the region of the corresponding pore.

Ion transfer voltammetry was used to characterize all the
prepared
microsupports. First, we investigated the behavior of micropore-ITIES
formed with methyl deactivated capillary tubing having an internal
diameter of 25 μm. Due to the pore interior intrinsic hydrophobic
nature (methyl deactivated), it was filled with the organic phase
(10 mM BTPPA+TPBCl– solubilized in 1,2-dichloroethane
(for details see the Supporting Information) and put in contact with the aqueous 10 mM HCl solution. Typical
blank voltammograms were recorded and are shown in Figure S1. At the lower potential values side, the potential
window is limited by the Cl– transfer giving the
positive peak governed by diffusion limited Clorg→aq– and negative
current drop when Claq→org–. On the higher potential values side,
the potential window is limited by positive and negative currents
attributed to Haq→org+ and Horg→aq+ partitioning, respectively. To further
characterize the formed interface, we used the well investigated tetramethylammonium
cation (TMA+) as a model ion. In Figure 2A is shown the ion transfer voltammograms
recorded for different TMA+ concentrations ranging from
1 to 50 μM. The asymmetric shape of the curve was obtained with
the sigmoidal signal for the forward scan (TMAaq→org+) and peak like signal
for the back transfer. This unique shape of the voltammetry curve
is governed by different diffusion profiles located on both sides
of the ITIES. On the aqueous side of the interface the mass transport
is governed by hemispherical diffusion (see Figure 1C), and hence steady state currents are obtained.
Note that, for the higher TMA+ concentrations, the positive
current wave does not reach a plateau but slightly increases as the
potential is swept toward
more positive values. This is due to Haq→org+ crossing the interface in this potential
range (around 0.5 V in Figure 2A). The Faradaic current of the sigmoidal signal is almost
unaffected by the applied scan rate as shown in Figure SI3 (deviation observed for 5 mV s–1 indicates that small ITIES ingress into the pore is possible (Supporting Information contains additional discussion).
The backward ion-transfer occurring inside the capillary is dictated
by a linear diffusion (Figure 2D) and gives the characteristic peak-like signal.

Figure 2 (A) Ion transfer
voltammograms recorded for TMA+ in
a methyl deactivated fused silica micropore with 25 μm diameter.
The [TMA+] is equal to 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μM.
(B) Steady state sigmoidal wave current (positive values, forward
scan) and peak current (negative values, reversed scan) as a function
of [TMA+]. (C) Hemispherical diffusion governed on the
aqueous side of the ITIES and (D) linear diffusion established inside
the hydrophobic pore.

Electrochemistry, in addition to microscopy-based methods,
can
be used to determine the dimensions of the electroactive interface.
Based on the asymmetric shape of the obtained voltammograms, we conclude
that the interface is located at the pore opening, and hence the ion
transfer on the aqueous side of the ITIES, resembles inlaid disc electrode
behavior. For such a case, the steady-state current (ISS) can be described using the Saito equation:26,27 1  where n is the charge of
the transferring ion (equal to 1 for TMA+), D corresponds to the diffusion coefficient (13.8 × 10–6 cm2 s–1),28C is the bulk concentration expressed in mol cm–3, F is the Faraday constant (96450
s A mol–1), and r stands for the
pore radius in cm. Since the capillaries used in this study have a
thick insulating layer, in other words, the ratio between outer and
inner capillary radius (Rg parameter) is always larger than 12, correction
for back-diffusion is not required.15 Using eq 1, the steady-state current
(ISS = 0.31 nA) from Figure 1A recorded for [TMA+] = 50 μM, we obtain an internal radius of the capillary equal
to 11.7 μm, which is very close to expected 12.5 μm. The
electrochemical detection of TMA+ gave a linear calibration
curve (see Figure 2B) from 1 to 50 μM, with a coefficient of determination equal
to R2 = 0.999 and 0.997 (n = 8) for forward and reverse scans, respectively. The voltammetric
sensitivity for the forward scan is equal to 5.92 × 10–3 nA μM–1 and agrees well with values reported
for other miniaturized ITIES platforms.12 In addition to the experimental conditions (e.g., scan rate) and
physicochemical properties of the analyte (e.g., diffusion coefficient
or charge), the sensitivity of the ionic transfer from inside the
pore to the contacted phase was found to be very much affected by
the pore geometry.20,29 When conical micropores were
filled with the organic phase, 2 orders of magnitude higher sensitivities
were found when the interface was located at the cone base with the
higher radius comparing to the up-side-down analogue (ITIES located
at the cone base with lower radius).20 This
was explained as the tapered diffusion zones promote analyte accumulation
inside the pore. In our case, the pore is cylindrical. The sensitivity
of the TMA+ back transfer is 2 times higher (10.60 ×
10–3 nA μM–1) than that
obtained for the forward scan meaning that analyte accumulation in
the pore might occur.

Next, we have investigated capillaries
having 5, 10, and 25 μm
diameter with a hydrophilic interior. To prevent leakage of the aqueous
phase, the exterior of the pore was made hydrophobic by silanization
with chlorotrimethylsilane (see Figure 3,1). Each capillary was filled with an aqueous 10 mM
HCl solution and subsequently was contacted with the organic phase.

Figure 3 (1) Capillary

of the aqueous phase from the inside pore. (3) Capillary internal
walls silanization to host (4) the organic phase inside the pore.
(A) Cyclic voltammogram recorded at nondeactivated silica pore of
10 μm filled with 10 mM HCl solution. Parts B, C, and D correspond
to cyclic voltammograms recorded at 25, 10, and 5 μm in diameters
silanized nondeactivated silica pores filled with the organic phase.
The [TMA+] for all graphs equals 50 μM. The scan
rate was 10 mV s–1.

When compared to the previous investigated configuration,
different
current characteristics are obtained: (i) disappearance of the peak
attributed to a Clorg→aq– limiting the potential window on lower
potential side (see Figure SI2B,D,F) and
(ii) voltammograms diverted along potential axis for TMA+ transfer (see Figure 3A) giving peak for the forward and sigmoidal wave for reversed partitioning.
Although it can be concluded that the interface is located within
the pore entrance, ITIES configuration with the aqueous phase inside
the pore resulted in a set of interesting observations: (i) the forward
and reversed signals diminish as a result of consecutive cycling,
(ii) lower than expected ion transfer currents were recorded or even,
(iii) did not appear for the capillary with the smallest diameter
(see Figure S4). All these observations
are probably related to TMA+ depletion inside the pore
originating from (i) hindered diffusion from the bulk of the aqueous
phase to the interface, as a result of the pore length, and (ii) not
fully reversible back transfer from the organic phase. The capillaries
with the hydrophilic interior were silanized, as shown in Figure 3, in order to accommodate
the organic phase inside the micropore. Experiments with TMA+ showed similar characteristics as described for methyl deactivated
capillaries. Using eq 1 and the values of ISS read out from Figure 3B, 0.35 nA; C, 0.12
nA; and D, 0.05 nA, we calculated the diameter for each micropore
to be equal to 26, 9, and 4 μm, respectively, all being very
close to the expected 25, 10, and 5 μm.

To demonstrate
its electroanalytical utility, a methyl deactivated
silica fused micropore was used as a device to study, for the first
time, ofloxacin behavior at the ITIES. At studied pH = 2, the charge
of ofloxacin is localized within the piperazine ring (pKa ≈ 8)30 and is equal
to +1 as deduced from the log[I(Ilim – I)−1]
vs ΔorgaqΦ dependency (see Figure SI5 for
details). Figure 4 shows
the cyclic voltammograms together with corresponding concentration
calibration curves recorded in the range from 1 μM to 50 μM.
The standard ofloxacin ion transfer potential ΔorgaqΦofl0 = 119 mV. Steady-state
currents on the forward scan and diffusion limited peak on the reverse
scan were recorded and are in agreement with the asymmetric diffusion
layers profile distribution. The limit of detection was calculated
using 2  where SD is the standard deviation of the
intercept and S is the slope of the calibration curve
and equals 0.19 μM for the forward and 0.06 μM for the
reversed signal. A twice higher sensitivity of the reversed (6.23
× 10–3 nA μM–1) compared
to the forward signal (2.85 × 10–3 nA μM–1) indicates that preconcentration of the ofloxacin
occurs inside the pore during the forward scan. This is probably due
to local accumulation effect governed by a lower diffusivity of the
drug in the organic phase and the confined space of a micropore. Obtained
values of the coefficient of determination (for both signals R2 = 0.999) indicate a high precision of the
measurement and stability of the soft junction supported with the
studied capillary. The utility of the developed micro-ITIES support
is very promising and will be further explored in electroanalytical
studies of different drugs molecules.

antibiotic at 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μM. The forward scan

the standard transfer potential of TMA+ = 160 mV. Insert

B corresponds to calibration curves prepared based on corresponding
voltammetric signals.

Conclusions
A simple, fast, and low-cost method for the
ITIES miniaturization
is presented. The utilization of silica fused capillaries with discontinuous
surface chemistry at the pore entrance allowed us to control the ITIES
position as was verified with ion transfer voltammetry. The versatility
of the system to induce phase inversion was easily achieved by surface
silanization of the internal or external capillary walls. The pores
filled with the organic phase gave highly stable and repeatable results.
The platform developed in our work demonstrates the accurate ofloxacin
determination in a concentrations range from 1 μM to 50 μM.
This work shows that silica fused micropores supporting ITIES can
be used as the electroanalytical devices.
