Absolute
quantification of proteins in tissue is important for
numerous fields of study. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) methods are the norm but typically involve lengthy
sample preparation including tissue homogenization, which results
in the loss of information relating to spatial distribution. Here,
we propose liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) mass spectrometry
(MS) of stable isotope labeled mimetic tissue models for the spatially
resolved quantification of intact ubiquitin in rat and mouse brain
tissue. Measured ubiquitin concentrations are in agreement with values
found in the literature. Images of rat and mouse brain tissue demonstrate
spatial variation in the concentration of ubiquitin and demonstrate
the utility of spatially resolved quantitative measurement of proteins
in tissue. Although we have focused on ubiquitin, the method has the
potential for broader application to the absolute quantitation of
any endogenous protein or protein-based drug in tissue.

==== Body
Proteins
are important molecules
that play key roles in all life processes. Many proteins serve as
biomarkers which distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues;
therefore, their quantification may potentially reveal new information
about disease state. Relative quantification can be achieved by comparing
the abundance of protein signals in different physiological states.
Absolute quantification requires comparison to the ion abundance detected
from samples of known composition. Liquid chromatography coupled to
mass spectrometry (LC–MS) is commonly employed in the quantification
of proteins in biological samples. Usually this involves a bottom-up
approach in which the protein is digested into proteolytic peptides
and tagging of the protein (or its peptides) with a label containing
stable isotope(s). The label may be introduced via metabolic, chemical,
or enzymatic means.1,2 Commonly used methods include
stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC), isotope-coded
affinity tags (ICAT), isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification
(iTRAQ), and dimethyl labeling.1−3 Sample preparation for such methods
is lengthy and there are inherent challenges associated with bottom-up
protein identification such as inefficient digestion, failure to identify
peptides, and loss of post-translational modifications.4 The alternative to proteolytic digestion is the
top-down approach in which intact proteins are analyzed by tandem
mass spectrometry.5 Top-down quantification
approaches use both labeling and label-free methods; however, labeling
has been shown to have its limitations and label-free methods require
robust tools for data analysis.6 Top-down
protein quantification involves LC–MS separation prior to MS
analysis, and LC–MS typically requires sample homogenization.
Consequently, spatial information is not retained meaning valuable
biological information is lost.7,8

Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI) enables spatial profiling of analytes
within thin tissue sections. Ambient MSI methods are particularly
suited to quantitative analysis, due to the limited sample preparation
required.9 Samples do not undergo any specific
sample preparation, such as addition of a matrix compound, resulting
in lower ion suppression and enhanced sensitivity.10 A number of examples of quantitative ambient MSI have been
reported.11−13 Liquid sampling techniques in which desorption and
ionization stages are decoupled are even more attractive because this
affords the opportunity for off-line incorporation of an internal
standard.14

In 2013, Groseclose and
Castellino reported a novel method for
spatially resolved quantification of small molecule drugs in tissue
via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) MS imaging
(MSI),7 which has since been adopted in
conjunction with MALDI and other mass spectrometry imaging techniques.8,12−15 The production of an external calibration sample comprised of tissue
homogenates spiked with known amounts of isotopically labeled analyte
of interest, termed the “mimetic tissue model”, enabled
absolute quantitation. Thin tissue sections of the mimetic model were
placed adjacent to sections from experimental samples and imaged under
the same conditions. A calibration curve was generated from the mimetic
model, and the experimental sample compared against this. Groseclose
and Castellino demonstrated that the histology (overall tissue density
and distribution of cell nuclei) and mass spectra (total ion currents)
were consistent between the mimetic model and intact tissues, i.e.,
the homogenized and nonhomogenized tissue are comparable as background
matrixes. A study by Swales et al. reported quantitative LESA imaging
of four drug compounds in rat liver using the mimetic tissue model
approach.14

Herein we demonstrate
the use of LESA MS for the quantification
of intact proteins in biological tissue using the example of ubiquitin.
Ubiquitin is a regulatory protein involved in many processes, most
notably protein degradation. It is found in every cell type, and it
is highly conserved through eukaryotic species.16 It is therefore a suitable model for the quantitative LESA
MS approach. In this study, we have incorporated stable isotope labeled
(C13, N15) ubiquitin into a rat brain tissue
mimetic model for use as a calibration reference standard. We were
able to perform quantitative imaging via stable isotope labeled mimetics
(SLiM) LESA MS of ubiquitin in rat and mouse brain tissue with a pixel
size of 2 mm. Calculated concentration values of ubiquitin across
the tissue were compared to those reported in the literature measured
via LC–MS techniques and were found to be in good agreement.

In developing this method, we followed the FDA guidelines for Bioanalytical
Method Validation.17 Validation parameters
include lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), upper limit of quantification
(ULOQ), precision (represented by coefficient of variation), accuracy
(% difference between experimental and nominal values), selectivity,
sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability of samples over time.

Results
and Discussion
A method was devised to measure the concentration
of ubiquitin
in rat and mouse brain tissue in a spatially resolved manner. The
workflow is summarized in Figure S1 (see
the Supporting Information); briefly, a mimetic tissue model was prepared
by spiking known quantities of C13, N15-labeled
ubiquitin into homogenized rat brain tissue. The labeled ubiquitin
is chemically identical to endogenous ubiquitin and is therefore assumed
to have the same solubility and desorption/ionization efficiency.
The isotopic labeling of ubiquitin with C13 and N15 results in a mass shift of 473.8612 Da between the labeled (9033.4779
Da) and endogenous (8559.6167 Da) proteins, allowing the labeled protein
to be detected without interference from the endogenous ubiquitin
(which is present in all brain tissues). Thin tissue sections of the
mimetic tissue model were placed adjacent to sections of rat or mouse
brain tissue on a glass slide, and the whole slide was imaged using
LESA MSI. An example section of the tissue mimetic model, labeled
with LESA sampling locations, is presented in Figure 1A. Example mass spectra from three mimetics
with different concentrations (Figure 1B) show that it was possible to detect both endogenous
and labeled ubiquitin simultaneously. Both endogenous and labeled
ubiquitin were observed in 7+ through 10+ charge states, with the
most abundant charge states being 9+ and 10+. The relative abundance
of the labeled ubiquitin increases with mimetic concentration (and
none is observed in the blank), whereas the relative abundance of
the endogenous ubiquitin remains constant. Figure 1C represents overview intensity maps of the
9+ and 10+ charge states of labeled ubiquitin following LESA MS of
the mimetics. Each row comprises eight separate sampling locations
for a specific labeled ubiquitin concentration (i.e., one row per
mimetic concentration).

curve for the 9+ charge state of labeled ubiquitin. Calibration data
points are shown in black; validation data points are shown in blue.
Least squares fitting was applied to the calibration data.

A total of seven mimetics with nonzero concentrations were
prepared
and analyzed. In the initial experiment, the most abundant charge
state observed in the mass spectra was 10+. Therefore, the signal
intensity of the most abundant isotopomer of the 10+ charge state
was plotted against the mimetic ubiquitin concentration (see Figure S2). FDA guidance for the validation of
analytical and bioanalytical methods17 states
that the analyte response at the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)
should be at least 5 times that of the blank response. Results for
the three lowest concentration mimetics did not meet this criterion,
where the LLOQ was 68.6 nmol/g, and were excluded from the data set.
The upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) for these experiments was
163 nmol/g (% CV 7.55%).

Subsequent experiments made use of
five mimetic concentrations
(blank, 68.6 nmol/g, 94.7 nmol/g, 122.6 nmol/g, 163 nmol/g). For each
concentration, seven locations were sampled. Replicate data acquired
for each calibration sample were randomly split into 4 calibration
and 3 validation (or quality control) data points in accordance with
FDA guidance.17 In these experiments, the
most abundant charge state was observed to be 9+ instead of 10+, and
therefore the calibration data points were used to generate a calibration
curve from the 9+ charge state (see Figure 1D). The data were analyzed by linear regression
and a line was fitted with an associated R of 0.948
(R2 = 0.898). Individual data points acquired
from the same concentration sample showed a fairly high level of variation
(see Figure 1C,D).
Variation can be introduced during LESA sampling and analysis via
several routes including variable spreading of the sampling droplet
resulting in variation in area sampled, variation in proportion of
sampling solvent recovered from the surface during reaspiration, and
in the case of sampling a tissue mimetic, spatial variation in concentration
resulting from incomplete mixing of the homogenate. An assessment
of homogenate mixing was performed by taking multiple sections at
various depths of the mimetic volume, see Figure S3. The level of variability in the labeled and endogenous
protein signal was comparable; therefore, the source of variation
is more likely a function of the sampling process. The incorporation
of an internal standard (at fixed concentration) into the sampling
solvent or coated as a homogeneous layer over the sample could address
this challenge; however, a second labeled version of the protein would
be required for each separate internal standard, considerably increasing
the cost of the experiment. This will be considered as a future step
toward improving the reproducibility of the method.

The three
validation data points (at each of the mimetic concentrations)
were used to provide assessment of the method according to the guidance
provided by the FDA for the validation of analytical and bioanalytical
methods.17 The mean experimental concentration
was calculated and compared with the nominal concentration of the
mimetic (see Table 1). The coefficient of variation (% CV) between the experimental concentration
and the nominal concentration of each mimetic sample was then calculated
and meets the FDA precision requirements (<15%, and <20% for
the LLOQ) for all mimetic samples. To measure the accuracy of the
method, the % difference between back-calculated and nominal concentrations
were calculated. To meet accuracy requirements, concentrations must
fall within 15% deviation of the mean, except for LLOQ where 20% deviation
is acceptable. Two of the three samples meet this requirement.

Table 1 Nominal and Calculated Concentration
of Validation/Quality Control (QC) Data Points with Standard Deviation,
Coefficient of Variation (% CV), and Calculated % Difference
QC sample	nominal concentration [nmol/g]	mean of the calculated concentration [nmol/g]	standard deviation	% CV	% difference	
high QC	163.0	150.68	16.66	11.09	7.55	
middle QC	122.6	162.32	7.29	4.49	32.40	
low QC	68.6	67.01	11.78	17.58	2.32	
To demonstrate the selectivity of
our method, we calculated the
mean concentration in the blank mimetic sample which was 1.3 nmol/g
and below our LLOQ. Sensitivity is defined as the LLOQ as long as
it fulfills the accuracy and precision requirements; therefore, the
sensitivity of the method is 68.6 nmol/g.

Sagittal sections
of rat and mouse brain (ubiquitin is highly conserved
through eukaryotic species, i.e., the protein sequence is the same
in both organisms) were imaged using LESA MS under the same sampling
parameters as the calibration samples to quantify endogenous ubiquitin,
see Figure S4. The average concentration
of ubiquitin detected across the whole rat brain section was 139.641
± 95.403 nmol/g and in mouse brain was 90.233 ± 51.512 nmol/g.
Assuming an average rat brain mass of 2 g and mouse brain of 0.4 g,18 these values equate to ∼2.392 ±1.634
mg ubiquitin per rat brain and ∼0.309 ± 0.177 mg per mouse
brain. Kaiser et al. used a protein standard absolute quantification
(PSAQ) method which uses LC–MS to quantify ubiquitin in mouse
brain tissue and found that the total concentration of ubiquitin was
∼121 nmol/g tissue.16 This equates
to ∼0.416 (±0.017) mg ubiquitin per brain. To date and
to our knowledge, there is no information about the total ubiquitin
content in the rat brain available; therefore, it was not possible
to compare the calculated results to any reference value. Considering
the size of the rat and mouse brain, these numbers are in approximate
agreement. The LESA images in Figure S4 also suggest there might be a variability in the ubiquitin distribution
across the brain. The mouse tissue shows higher variability compared
to the rat tissue.

A complete repeat of the same experiment
was performed 1 year after
the initial experiment (see Figure S5),
using the same mimetic samples and quantifying ubiquitin in the rat
brain by using the most abundant charge state in those experiments
(10+). The average concentration of ubiquitin in the rat brain was
measured at 129.358 ± 98.401 nmol/g corresponding to ∼2.216
± 1.686 mg of ubiquitin per rat brain. The percentage difference
between this value and the value from the repeated experiment is within
7.4%. FDA guidelines suggest that the variation ±15% is acceptable,
and therefore this result demonstrates the stability of the samples
and reproducibility of the method.

Conclusions
We
report quantitative mass spectrometry imaging of ubiquitin in
tissue for the first time. The method passes validation criteria for
LLOQ, ULOQ, selectivity, sensitivity, precision, reproducibility,
and stability according to FDA guidelines. Absolute quantification
of ubiquitin was performed in a pixel-wise fashion and demonstrated
variability of ubiquitin concentration in different regions of the
mouse and rat brain. Results obtained from the two most abundant charge
states 9+ and 10+ were in good agreement. Future work will focus on
incorporation of an internal standard into the workflow to improve
the variability related to extraction efficiency, accuracy, and signal
intensity observed in LESA sampling. Although the focus here was on
ubiquitin, the method could in principle be adapted, with appropriate
validation, to measure the absolute concentration of any protein in
tissue including endogenous proteins and antibodies or protein-based
therapeutic compounds.
