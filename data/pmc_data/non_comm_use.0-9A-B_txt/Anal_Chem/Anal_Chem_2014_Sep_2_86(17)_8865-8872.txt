We
developed a cell-culture/biosensor platform consisting of aptamer-modified
Au electrodes integrated with reconfigurable microfluidics for monitoring
of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), an important
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine. Aptamers were thiolated, labeled
with redox reporters, and self-assembled on gold surfaces. The biosensor
was determined to be specific for TGF-β1 with an experimental
detection limit of 1 ng/mL and linear range extending to 250 ng/mL.
Upon determining figures of merit, aptasensor was miniaturized and
integrated with human hepatic stellate cells inside microfluidic devices.
Reconfigurable microfluidics were developed to ensure that seeding
of “sticky” stromal cells did not foul the electrode
and compromise sensor performance. This microsystem with integrated
aptasensors was used to monitor TGF-β1 release from activated
stellate cells over the course of 20 h. The electrochemical response
went down upon infusing anti-TGF-β1 antibodies into the microfluidic
devices containing activated stellate cells. To further validate aptasensor
responses, stellate cells were stained for markers of activation (e.g.,
alpha smooth muscle actin) and were also tested for presence of TGF-β1
using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Given the importance
of TGF-β1 as a fibrogenic signal, a microsystem with integrated
biosensors for local and continuous detection of TGF-β1 may
prove to be an important tool to study fibrosis of the liver and other
organs.

==== Body
The liver
is at the center of
body’s metabolism, and its injury by toxicants or infections
is the main cause of several diseases such as cirrhosis, fatty liver,
hepatitis, jaundice, and liver cancer.1,2 Liver fibrosis
is an inflammatory condition that is present during liver injury,
cancer, or infection.3 Transforming growth
factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is an important factor associated with
fibrosis of the liver and other organs.4 In the liver, TGF-β1 is secreted by the activated hepatic
stellate (stromal) cells, causing stellate cells to begin aberrant
production of extracellular matrix proteins and leading to loss of
differentiated hepatic phenotype.5−7

Given that TGF-β1
is a key molecular trigger of fibrosis
and liver injury, it is important to know how fast it appears and
what its dynamics are over the course of injury or insult. Immunoassays
traditionally used for detection of signaling molecules such as TGF-β
are limiting when it comes to determining secretion dynamics. We wanted
to leverage aptamer-based biosensors for continuous monitoring of
TGF-β1 secreted by liver cells. These aptasensors are based
on the concept of structure switching pioneered by Plaxco and co-workers.8,9 Our lab has been interested in placing aptasensors at the site of
cells for local, sensitive, and continuous detection of secreted molecules.10−12 Our focus has previously been on detecting inflammatory cytokines
secreted from immune cells.11,12 In this paper, we wanted
to develop an aptasensor for monitoring activation and TGF-β1
release from hepatic stellate cells. The aptamer was based on the
DNA sequence described in the literature.13 Unlike our previous work with anchorage independent immune cells,
stellate cells are quite adhesive, capable of attaching to and fouling
the electrode surfaces. To remedy this, a reconfigurable microfluidic
device was developed to allow for lowering of a microstructured poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) membrane to protect the electrodes during stellate cells seeding
and for raising during cell detection experiments.

The miniaturized
aptasensor was constructed by immobilizing methylene
blue (MB)-tagged TGF-β1 aptamer13 on top of Au electrodes placed inside of microfluidic devices. Stellate
cells were cultivated inside microfluidic devices next to sensing
electrodes. The aptamer immobilized electrodes were protected with
PDMS microcups in order to avoid nonspecific attachment of cells during
seeding. The cells were then activated by infusion of platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF). Onset and progression of TGF-β1 release
was monitored using square wave voltammetry (SWV) over the course
of 20 h. This TGF-β1 sensor provides highly specific and sensitive
detection. The PDGF activation of stellate cells was verified with
immunostaining and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

were used without further purification. The ELISA kit was obtained

In the present study, we utilized
a TGF-β1-binding aptamer (IDT Technologies, San Diego, CA) having
a loop structure with amino functionality at the 5′ and thiol
functionality at the 3′ end.The backbone
of single-stranded DNA aptamers was modified
to have phosphorothioates (represented by “∗”
in the aptamer sequence) on 5′ of both A and C. This modification
is believed to provide enhanced nuclease resistance as well as higher
affinity than that of a phosphate counterpart.13 The aptamer stock solution was made in 40 mM HEPES buffer
containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2.

Functionalization
and Immobilization of Aptamers
To
fabricate an electrochemical biosensor, the TGF-β1 aptamer was
tagged with MB, an electroactive redox label. NHS-labeled MB was conjugated
to the 5′-end of amino-modified TGF-β1 aptamer through
the succinimide ester coupling reported previously.9,14 Prior
to modification of the Au electrodes, aptamer stock solution was reduced
in 10 mM TCEP for 1 h to cleave disulfide bonds. This solution was
then diluted in HEPES buffer to achieve the desired aptamer concentration
(1 μM, the optimal concentration for TGF-β1 binding).
For immobilization of aptamer onto the microfabricated Au electrodes,
1 μM MB-tagged TGF-β1 aptamer solution was infused into
the working channels of the microfluidic device followed by incubation
for about 18 h at 4 °C in the dark. Following incubation, the
channels were rinsed with copious amounts of deionized water and HEPES
and then incubated with 1 mM MCH for 15 min to displace nonspecifically
adsorbed aptamer molecules and to passivate the electrode surface.

Design and Fabrication of Microfluidic Device with Integrated
Electrodes
In order to avoid nonspecific attachment of the
stellate cell to the sensing electrodes during cell seeding, we designed
a reconfigurable microfluidic device of the kind shown in Scheme 1A. This device consisted of two PDMS layers assembled
onto a glass slide with micropatterned Au electrodes. The micropatterned
Au arrays of eight electrodes of diameter 300 μM were prepared
using standard photolithography and a metal-etching process.15,16 One PDMS layer contained a linear channel with length × width
× height dimensions of 15 mm × 1.7 mm × 0.075 mm. This
was the control layer used for actuation of the working microfluidic
layer. The latter consisted of eight microchannels, each with length
× width × height dimensions of 6 mm × 1.2 mm ×
0.075 mm. Each microchannel contained four microcups with inner and
outer diameters of 500 and 700 μm, respectively, and the height
of 0.060 mm. The device assembly steps included integration of the
control PDMS layer (thickness ∼5 mm) on another thin PDMS layer
(thickness ∼1 mm) containing eight microchannels with microcups
followed by assembling the joint layers of PDMS with microfabricated
Au electrodes. The layers of the device were bound together and to
the substrate by O2 plasma treatment. Alignment of each
layer during the device assembly was checked optically under the microscope.
The device was left for 15 min at room temperature and then filled
with deionized water to remove the bubbles. The tubing was attached
in the control layer, and glass cylinders (diameter 8 mm) were placed
at the inlets of the device using 10:1 ratio of PDMS and curing agent
followed by baking for 20 min at 70 °C. This device was utilized
to culture stellate cells next to the aptasensing electrodes preventing
nonspecific attachment of cells on the sensor by lowering and raising
the PDMS microcups (Scheme 1B).

Scheme 1 (A) Microfluidic
Device Was Composed of Three Layers: Glass Slide
with Micropatterned Au Electrodes, PDMS Layer with Fluid Channels
and Microcups, and Another PDMS Layer for Controlling of Microcups.
(B) Diagram Showing Actuation of Microcups to Protect Electrodes during
Collagen Coating and Cell Seeding into the Channel
Once cells are activated and
microcups are raised, the electrodes may be used for detection of
TGF-β1. Redox labeled aptmer molecules immobilized on the electrode
interact with TGF-β1, leading to a change in redox current.
The redox current is decreased when TGF-β1 binds.

Cultivation of Stellate Cells inside Sensing Microfluidic Devices
A human hepatic stellate cell line (LX2) was maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 200 units/mL penicillin, and 200 μg/mL
streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Cells were cultured in a tissue culture flask (growth area of 75 cm2) until 90% confluence and then passaged. For cell seeding
experiments, aptamer functionalized working Au electrodes were first
protected with PDMS microcups by applying positive pressure through
the control layer and HEPES buffer was flowed into the microchannels.
Subsequently, 0.1 mg/mL solution of collagen (type I) was infused
into the channels and kept at room temperature for about 1 h to adsorb
collagen on the glass surface around aptasensing electrodes. The channels
were again washed with buffer and sterilized under UV. Stellate cells,
resuspended at a concentration of 1.6 × 106 cells/mL
in DMEM described above, were infused into a microfluidic device and
incubated at 37 °C.

Characterization of TGF-β1 Aptasensor
Using Electrochemistry
and Surface Plasmon Resonance
In order to obtain the optimal
TGF-β1 aptasensor, we characterized aptamer immobilization and
target binding via a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) flow through
system (Biosensing Instruments, USA). In all the SPR experiments,
the system was purged with the running buffer solution (HEPES) to
set and stabilize an initial baseline. Subsequently, TGF-β1
aptamer was loaded at the flow rate of 40 μL/min in the SPR
flow system and allowed to interact with the Au surface. At the completion
of binding, the surface was washed with running buffer and the final
baseline was recorded. The SPR angle (m°) difference (represented
by the y-axis in Figure S1, Supporting
Information) between the final and initial baselines in the
binding curve corresponds to the change in refractive index due to
bound TGF-β1aptamer. The aptamer modified SPR surface was challenged
with a series of recombinant TGF-β1 concentrations to find the
binding affinity of TGF-β1 aptamer with recombinant TGF-β1.

Additional initial optimization studies to find out the response
and specificity of TGF-β1 aptamer were carried out by performing
square wave voltammetry (SWV) using a potentiostat (CHI instruments,
model 842B) at a frequency of 60 Hz over the potential range from
0 to −0.50 V. Au-coated Si substrates were incubated with TGF-β1
aptamer (1 μM) and were then placed into a homemade electrochemical
cell creating an electrode area of 1.13 cm2 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Pt wire counter electrode
and Ag/AgCl reference electrode were immersed into the electrolyte
solution to complete the three-electrode cell. The aptasensors were
also challenged with nonspecific proteins such as IgG, BSA, IL-2,
and IFN-γ as well as the analyte of interest TGF-β1. Responses
to other isoforms of TGF-β were also studied.

Electrochemical
Sensing of TGF-β1 Release from Stellate
Cells within the Microfluidic Device
The aptamer functionalized
microfluidic device was calibrated by infusing recombinant TGF-β1
ranging in concentration from 0.5 to 300 ng/mL in cell culture media
(DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 1% PS). For cell experiments,
miniaturized aptasensing electrodes were protected by lowering down
the PDMS microcups (Scheme 1B) via application
of positive pressure created in the control layer (filled with water
and clamped). The hepatic stellate cells were cultured around aptasensing
electrodes inside the microchannels of the device. To stimulate cells
for TGF-β1 secretion, mitogenic solution, consisting of 20 ng/mL
PDGF spiked in DMEM, was injected into the microchannels. After activation
of cells, pressure was released from the control layer raising PDMS
cups and exposing the aptasenor to the cytokines released from the
activated stellate cells (Scheme 1B). Real-time
SWV measurements were performed for up to 20 h to detect the TGF-β1
release from cells by the aptasensor. For the microfluidic electrochemical
set up, we used a flow-through Ag/AgCl reference electrode and Pt
wire counter electrode connected to the outlet and inlet of the fluid
system. A homemade switching system was employed to sample individual
electrodes at predefined time intervals. During the electrochemical
experiment, the device was kept in a custom-designed environmental
box with 5% CO2 and temperature of 37 °C. As shown
in Scheme 1, our device contains 8 individually
addressable electrodes, one electrode per fluidic channel. However,
four microchannels are connected to one inlet and one outlet. We used
one set of four channels to measure the TGF-β1 release from
PDGF treated stellate cells, whereas the other set of four channels
was used to monitor cytokine production in nontreated cells.

Verifying
Activation of Stellate Cells by Immunofluorescent
Staining and ELISA
Hepatic stellate cells in four of the
microfluidic channels were stimulated with 20 ng/mL PDGF for 24 h
while the cells in the other four channels were left unstimulated.
Cells inside the microfluidic devices were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) + 0.3% Triton-X100 (Sigma) in PBS for
15 min followed by incubation in blocking solution (1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS) for 1 h. The channels were washed several times
with PBS and exposed to rabbit anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA,
Abcam) antibody for 90 min. The samples were again washed for 5 min
and incubated with goat antirabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa-488 (diluted
1:1000) (Invitrogen) for 1 h. After a 5 min washing with PBS, samples
were incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min.
All incubations were performed at room temperature. Fluorescent images
were captured by a NIKON Eclipse Ti.

TGF-β1
ELISA was performed using the ELISA kit obtained from R&D Systems.
1.6 × 106 cells/mL stellate cells were seeded in each
well of the collagen-coated 6-well plate using the same method used
for the microfluidic device. Half of the wells were treated with 20
ng/mL PDGF, and the rest were left with nonstimulated DMEM. Samples
were collected from each well after 48 h of PDGF treatment. ELISA
was conducted in a 96-well plate using the protocol provided by R&D
Systems.

Results and Discussion
The goal
of this paper was to develop an electrochemical aptasensor
for detection of TGF-β1, an important inflammatory and fibrogenic
cytokine. A biosensor specific and sensitive for TGF-β1 was
developed, miniaturized, and integrated with microfluidics. This sensing
microsystem was then employed to monitor the TGF-β1 release
from stellate cells in the process of activation.

SPR and Electrochemical
Analysis of Aptamer-TGF-β1 Interactions
In order to
arrive at the ideal TGF-β1 aptasensor, we characterized
aptamer immobilization and target binding via SPR studies (Supporting Information). These investigations
showed 1 μM to be an optimal aptamer concentration for target
binding. To determine the binding affinity of TGF-β1 aptamer
with recombinant TGF-β1, the aptamer-modified SPR surface was
challenged with a series of TGF-β1 concentrations (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Kinetic analysis of
the obtained binding data was done via the “Scrubber”
software package provided with the SPR instrument to determine the
equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd).
The value of Kd for aptamer–target
binding was found to be 1.07 nM. This data analysis utilizes SPR angle
shift, due to the change in refractive index, as a response unit to
quantify the binding of macromolecules at the sensor surface.

The surface density (Ntot) of 1 μM
TGF-β1 apatmer on the Au surface was determined to be 3.83 ×
1012 molecules/cm2 via electrochemistry utilizing
eq 1.17 1  where Iavg(E0) is the average peak
current in a voltammogram, n is the number of electrons
transferred per redox event
(with MB label n = 2), F is the
Faraday current, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, E is the peak amplitude,
and f is the frequency.

Additional studies
to determine specificity of TGF-β1 aptamer
were carried out using electrochemistry. Redox-labeled aptamer molecules
were assembled on Au electrodes and loaded into a homemade electrochemical
cell as described in the previous section of the manuscript. These
electrodes were challenged with 50 ng/mL concentrations of IgG, BSA,
IL-2, IFN-γ, and TGF-β1. Figure 1A shows that aptasensor response to nonspecific proteins was less
than 10% of the signal generated in response to TGF-β1. Comparison
of sensor responses to three known isoforms of TGF-β (1, 2,
3) showed ∼15% cross-reactivity with TGF-β3 and 30% cross-reactivity
with TGF-β2 (Figure 1B). This observation
is not unexpected in light of homology between TGF-β1 and -β3.5

and specific molecule. These results show that the biosensor did not
respond to nonspecific proteins but did respond to TGF-β1. (B)

Operation of the Microfluidic Device
In the multilayered
microfluidic device, the upper most PDMS layer controls the raising
and lowering of the microcups fabricated into the other PDMS layer
(Figure 2A). The up and down action of the
PDMS layer was regulated by applying positive or negative pressure
via the control layer. Water was injected into the control layer to
apply positive pressure and was evacuated to create negative pressure.

channels of the reconfigurable microfluidic device
are infused with red dye whereas the control layer is filled with
black dye. (B, C) Device is reconfigured, lowering microcups around
the electrodes. The channels are filled with red dye to highlight
that the area around the electrodes remains free of dye. (C) Higher
magnification view of the electrodes being sequestered from the rest
of the channel.

In Figure 2, food dye was used to illustrate
the working principle of the microfluidic device. In Figure 2A, the PDMS control channel was filled with black
dye while the bottom layer was infused with red dye. This image shows
the presence of 8 parallel microchannels, each containing a sensing
electrode. Figure 2B,C shows the microchannels
that were infused with red dye after the cups where lowered (control
layer filled with water). Thus, one can see dye-free white regions
around the electrodes, surrounded by red liquid.

The ability to reconfigure the microfluidic channel to separate
the environment around the electrodes from the rest of the fluidic
channel was used to seed cells. Figure 3A,B
shows stellate cells 30 min and 12 h after seeding into the microfluidic
channel. One can see an annular region around the electrode that was
protected by microcups and remained free of cells after seeding. To
highlight the importance of protecting electrodes during the seeding
of “sticky” anchorage-dependent stellate cells, aptamer-functionalized
electrodes were characterized by SWV after seeding cells with or without
microcup protection. As shown in Figure 3C,
the redox signal of electrodes directly exposed to cell seeding was
about 15-fold lower than the electrode protected with microcups. Thus,
the reconfigurable microfluidic device allowed us to ensure that aptasensors
were not fouled during collagen coating and cell seeding steps and
retained the high sensitivity needed for cell secretion monitoring.

(C) SWV curves looking at the MB signal obtained from aptasensor when
cells were seeded with and without microcup protection. These results
show 15-fold higher peak currents for the electrode protected by microcups
during cell seeding.

Monitoring of TGF-β1 Release from Stellate Cells
As
described in Scheme 1B, it was expected
that our biosensor would react to TGF-β1 secreted from stellate
cells, providing an electrochemical signal associated with the amount
and the rate of cytokine secretion. Prior to carry out cell detection
experiments, we wanted to construct calibration curves to determine
the linear range of the miniature aptasensors integrated with microfluidics.
Figure 4A shows typical response of aptasensor
to varying (increasing) concentration of exogenous TGF-β1. The
signal decreases with increasing concentration of the analyte and
is reported as signal suppression – ((initial current –
final current)/initial current). Figure 4B
shows a calibration curve of signal suppression vs TGF-β1 concentration.
The experimental data shows the linear range for our biosensor from
1 to 250 ng/mL for exogenous TGF-β1.

Figure 4 (A) SWV curves obtained
for aptamer-modified electrodes challenged
with recombinant TGF-β1 ranging in concentration from 1 to 300
ng/mL. (B) Signal suppression plotted against recombinant TGF-β1
concentration. The aptamer shows good response in the cell culture
media with signal saturation after 250 ng/mL TGF-β1.

For TGF-β1 release experiments, stellate
cells were seeded
into microfluidic channels that were reconfigured so as to protect
aptasensing electrodes. Upon attaching and spreading, cells were stimulated
by infusion of PDGF, growth factor known to activate stellate cells.18−20 The device was reconfigured once again to raise the microcups, allowing
for cell secreted factors to diffuse to the nearby sensing electrode.
The resultant electrochemical signals were continuously monitored
by sequentially addressing aptasensing electrodes. To ensure viability
and function, microfluidic devices with stellate cells were kept under
physiological temperature and 5% CO2 during the 20 h experiment.

Figure 5A shows TGF-β1 secretion results
after PDGF activation. In our experiments, one inlet of the device,
connected to four cell seeded microchannels, was infused with stimulant
to activate the cells while the other four channels contained quiescent
cells. As highlighted by data in Figure 5A,
electrodes in proximity to activated stellate cells were recording
significantly higher changes in redox current (signal suppression)
compared to electrodes near quiescent cells. After 18 h, the electrodes
near activated stellate cells reached 80% signal suppression whereas
sensors next to quiescent cells showed less than 20% signal suppression.
Given that 80% signal suppression corresponds to a saturated aptasensor
(see Figure 4B), the electrode sensing activated
stellate cells likely became saturated after 18 h of monitoring.

electrodes. The device was kept in the CO2 and temperature
control chamber during the SWV experiments. (B) Change of the TGF-β1
secretion rate over time obtained from the reaction-diffusion model
analyzed with COMSOL.

To determine cell secretion rates based on the binding curves
shown
in Figure 5A, we constructed a numerical model
for simulating cytokine production, diffusion, convection, and binding
using COMSOL multiphysics (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA). The geometry
and sensor configuration were the actual sensing devices used for
the experiments. The main parameters in the simulations are listed
in Table 1.

Table 1 List of Parameters
Obtained Experimentally
and Further Used for Determining Secretion Rates via Simulation
diffusion coefficient	1.3 × 10–6 cm2/s	
surface binding density	3.38 × 1012 molecules/cm2	
association rate constant	4.48 × 105 M−1 s−1	
dissociation rate constant	4.82 × 10–4 s−1	
flow rate	0.1 μL/min	
We assumed a constant secretion rate
in each 3 h time interval
and then determined the secretion rate by the reaction–diffusion–convection
model coupled with least-squares approximation (further details provided
in the Supporting Information and ref (21)). From the model, the
average cytokine production rate from the stimulated cells within
the microfluidic channel was determined to be 0.0140 pg/cell/h (Figure 5B) while for quiescent cells, the rate was 0.0009
pg/cell/h. This rate is comparable to the production of TNF-α
by activated monocytes reported by our group previously. Our TGF-β
production rate over the course of 24 h (3.36 × 10–1 pg/cell) is considerably higher than rates reported for stellate
cells activated under standard tissue culture conditions (4.2 ×
10–5 to 3.2 × 10–3 pg/cell).1,22,23 This may be explained by the
enhanced sensitivity of our approach where local concentrations are
being monitored. It is also possible that confinement of stellate
cells inside low volume microfluidic channels enhances the rate of
TGF-β secretion.

A number of control experiments were
carried out to ensure that
the signal observed in Figure 5A was indeed
due to TGF-β1 secretion. Exposure of stellate cells to culture
media without PDGF did not cause an appreciable change in electrochemical
signal (Figure 5A, lower curve). Similarly,
there was no effect of PDGF containing media on the aptamer modified
Au surface without cells (result not shown).

We conducted another
control experiment where activated stellate
cells residing inside microfluidic channels were bathed with TGF-β1
antibodies during the sensing experiment. The presence of competing
antibody molecules abrogated redox signals at the sensing electrodes,
demonstrating once again that electrodes were indeed sensing secreted
TGF-β1 (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Characterizing Phenotype and Function of Stellate Cells Using
Molecular Biology Approaches
Immunofluorescent staining and
ELISA techniques were used to confirm that exposure to PDGF activated
stellate cells caused them to release TGF-β1. Figure 6A,B shows expression of α-SMA, one of the
benchmarks of stellate cell activation, in the presence and absence
of PDGF.24 These results clearly demonstrate
increased expression of SMA in cells after a 24 h exposure to PDGF,
indicating activation of these cells. Another correlate of stellate
cell activation is production of TGF-β1. We collected media
from activated and quiescent cells cultured in a well plate for 48
h and performed TGF-β1 ELISA. This experiment (Figure 6C) revealed that stellate cells activated with PDGF
produced 6 times more TGF-β1 compared to quiescent cells. While
it may not be possible to compare concentrations obtained with ELISA
and aptasensors due to differences in analytical methods, the 6-fold
enhancement in TGF-β1 activated and resting stellate cells was
observed for both approaches (see Figures 5A and 6C for comparison).

Conclusions
The
paper describes the use of aptamer-modified electrodes for
continuous monitoring of the TGF-β1 release from hepatic stellate
cells. While our lab has previously demonstrated detection from immune
cells,12,25 this study deals with monitoring secretory
activity of adhesive stromal cells. Reconfigurable microfluidic devices
were used to address electrode fouling problems. Such devices were
microfabricated to contain microcups imbedded in the roof of the microfluidic
channel. By actuating a control layer, microcups were lowered to protect
the electrodes during collagen coating and cell seeding steps. The
device was reconfigured once again after seeding and activation of
stellate cells, to commence the detection phase of the experiment.
These specific and sensitive aptasensors were used to electrochemically
monitor TGF-β1 secretion from activated and resting stellate
cells and to determine TGF-β1 secretion rates. Furthermore,
additional molecular biology assays demonstrated that stellate cells
were indeed activated by stimulation with PDGF and that these activated
stellate cells produced TGF-β1. In fact, a similar 6-fold ratio
of TGF-β1 production between activated and resting cells was
obtained using aptasensors inside microfluidic channels and ELISA
in 6-well plates. These results point to the fact that stellate cells
functioned similarly (vis a vis TGF-β1 secretion) inside microfluidic
devices and under standard tissue culture conditions. In combination
with aptasensor specificity testing, the TGF-β1 antibody competition
experiment showed that detection was indeed specific to secreted TGF-β1.
Given the importance of TGF-β1 signaling in inflammation, fibrogenesis,
T-cell differentiation, and stem cell development, the ability to
locally and continuously monitor production of TGF-β1 has high
significance. In the future, the duration of the detection experiment
will be extended from 20 h to multiple days. Multiplexed aptamer-based
detection of several important trophic factors is also envisioned.
