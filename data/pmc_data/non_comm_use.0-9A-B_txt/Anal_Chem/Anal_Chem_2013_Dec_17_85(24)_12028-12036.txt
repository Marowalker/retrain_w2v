We report on a novel gel based on
diffusive gradients in thin films
(DGT) for the simultaneous measurement of cations and anions and its
suitability for high resolution chemical imaging by using laser ablation
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The new high
resolution mixed binding gel (HR-MBG) is based on zirconium-hydroxide
and suspended particulate reagent-iminodiacetate (SPR-IDA) as resin
materials which are embedded in an ether-based urethane polymer hydrogel.
The use of this polymer hydrogel material allows the production of
ultrathin, highly stable and tear-proof resin gel layers with superior
handling properties compared to existing ultrathin polyacrylamide
gels. The gel was characterized regarding its uptake kinetics, the
anion and cation capacities, and the effects of pH, ionic strength,
and aging on the performance of the HR-MBG. Our results demonstrate
the capability of this novel gel for concomitant sampling of anions
and cations. The suitability of this new gel type for DGT chemical
imaging at submm spatial resolution in soils using LA-ICPMS is shown.
2D images of P, As, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn distributions around roots
of Zea mays L. demonstrate the new opportunities
offered by the HR-MBG for high-resolution mapping of solute dynamics
in soil and sediment hotspots, such as the rhizosphere, by simultaneous
observation of anionic and cationic solute species.

==== Body
It is well
established that
knowledge about the total concentrations of mineral elements in soil
is not sufficient to infer solute mobility or availability to plants.1 Therefore, a range of chemical soil extraction
procedures are used to measure the bioavailable fraction of nutrients
or contaminants. Some of these methods allow for the estimation of
labile (readily soluble) solute fractions which are assumed to be
indicators for plant availability.2,3 However, chemical
extractions establish a pseudoequilibrium between the soil solid phase
and the extractant for a given analyte but do not mechanistically
mimic solute uptake by plants. Consequently, many of these extractions
only show a relatively poor correlation with plant solute uptake or
plant growth response.2,4,5

Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) is a passive sampling technique
widely used for measuring solutes in water, sediments, and soils.6−10 In many cases, the DGT-labile solute fraction correlated better
with the plant uptake than that measured by chemical extractants.3,10 A recent isotope dilution study directly demonstrated that the DGT-labile
soil P fraction is largely identical to the plant-available fraction,
whereas a range of chemical extractants either under- or overestimated
plant-available P.4

DGT and Chemical Imaging
Apart from bulk sample analysis,
DGT has been applied for chemical imaging of labile solute distributions
in soils and sediments since the early days of the method.11 The capabilities to preconcentrate analytes
in situ and to sample readily soluble solute fractions render DGT
highly suitable for the investigations of nutrient and contaminant
distributions around roots. As previously suggested,10,12 mechanisms of nutrient and contaminant uptake and, in some cases
release, can be inferred from such chemical images.13

High-resolution chemical images of labile solutes
in soils and sediments can be generated by several DGT-based approaches,
i.e., (1) slicing of the gel to small pieces and measuring them individually
after elution,14,15 (2) computer imaging densitometry
(CID),8,16,17 and (3) laser
ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS).8,9,18 The method of gel slicing, individual
elution, and measurement of each gel piece is low-cost but tedious.
Furthermore, it has high limits of detection (LOD) when compared with
other methods and a spatial resolution limit of ∼0.5 mm at
best. CID is a simple and quick approach if a specific color reaction
can be exploited. Reported spatial resolutions were in the range of
200–400 μm.8,16,17 LA-ICPMS also offers high resolution (<100 μm) as well
as multielement analysis at low detection limits. Previous approaches
for chemical imaging using DGT gels used spot8 and line ablation.13,19 A comparison of both methods
suggests lower LODs and lower gas consumption for line scans than
for spot ablation.20 The main advantage
of line ablations is a high spatial resolution along the scan line
and a significant reduction in measurement time.

Important properties
of resin gels used for chemical imaging are
a small particle size of the resin and its homogeneous distribution
in the gel matrix as these may limit the resolution. Common resin
materials (Chelex 100, ferrihydrite) often have a bead size >100
μm
and are thus too large for imaging analysis, which has led to the
development of gels with highly homogeneous distributions of low-particle-size
(≤10 μm) sorbents. The resins used so far include suspended
particulate reagent-iminodiacetate (SPR-IDA),18 AgI,17 and zirconium oxide,14 which were added to the gel solution prior to
polymerization. Some sorbents can be directly precipitated into a
gel after polymerization, e.g., ferrihydrite and AgI.9,16

The suite of analytes that can be measured simultaneously
is determined
by the selection of resins that are incorporated into the gel. Gels
for measuring cationic or anionic solutes separately at high resolution
are available, but simultaneous imaging of cations and anions using
one DGT gel has not been possible so far. Some recently published
resin gels allow for the simultaneous measurement of anions and cations
in bulk samples21,22 but are not applicable for high
resolution LA-ICPMS measurements because of the coarse resin materials
used.

However, the concomitant imaging of anionic and cationic
species
is of great interest to enhance the understanding of biogeochemical
processes and of element uptake by plants. For example, the phosphate
distribution around roots of Brassica napus L. was
recently investigated.13 In addition to
the distribution of the phosphate anion, simultaneous imaging of Fe3+, Al3+, and Ca2+ is of interest, as
these species could indicate the dissolution of phosphate binding
sites (Fe- and Al-oxides) and mineral phosphates (Fe-, Al-, Ca-phosphates).
A second example for complex, highly localized interactions of anionic
and cationic species is the rhizosphere of paddy-field rice. Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides
are reductively dissolved in anaerobic conditions. Due to the O2 release by rice roots, Fe(II) is in turn oxidized in the
vicinity of the roots and reprecipitates, forming a layer of Fe-plaque
around roots. The dissolution and reformation of sorption sites for
both, anions and cations, is a key factor in nutrient and contaminant
dynamics in lowland rice.23,24 In both environments,
simultaneous DGT chemical imaging of anions and cations is of high
interest. This paper presents the production, the properties, and
characteristics of a novel DGT resin gel for the simultaneous high-resolution
measurements of anions and cations in soils and sediments using DGT–LA-ICPMS.

Experimental Section
DGT Theory
Geometrically well-defined,
plastic DGT
sampling devices contain a diffusive layer, commonly a polyacrylamide
gel overlain by a protective membrane, and a resin gel with incorporated
resin material.7,25 After sampler deployment, the
target analytes taken up by the resin gel are eluted and measured.
This allows for the calculation of time-averaged fluxes, fDGT, into the sampler and time averaged concentrations, cDGT, at the sampler–solution interface:25 1   2  M is the mass of analyte
taken up by the resin material during the sampling time, Δg is the thickness of the diffusive layer (including the
protective membrane), D is the diffusion coefficient
of the analyte in the diffusive layer, A is the sampling
window area, and t is the sampling time.

Lab Procedures
Wherever possible, sample handling and
preparation were performed in a biological class II laminar flow bench
(Clean Air, EuroFlow EF/S, Telstar Laboratory Equipment B.V., Woerden,
The Netherlands). Critical sample preparation steps as well as measurements
were done in a class 100,000 cleanroom. The glassware and plastics
in direct contact with the gel solution or resin gels were acid washed
in 10% HNO3 and subsequently rinsed with laboratory water
type 1 (0.055 μS cm–1 provided by a TKA-GenPure
purification system, Thermo Electron LED GmbH, Niederelbert, Germany)
three times prior to use. All solutions were prepared using laboratory
water type 1. Chemical reagents of analytical grade were used in all
experiments. Sample preparation for liquid ICPMS analysis was done
using laboratory water type 1 and nitric acid of reagent grade (EMSURE
ISO, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) which were further purified in-house
by using a sub-boiling distillation system (Milestone Inc., Shelton,
CT, USA). If not stated otherwise, DGT deployment solutions used for
the characterization of the gels had an electrolyte background concentration
of 10 mmol L–1 NaNO3 (Sigma Aldrich,
Reagent Plus) and the pH was in equilibrium with ambient air (pH 5.6
± 0.2). The deployment solutions were well stirred at 300–400
rpm using magnetic stirrers. If not stated otherwise, all measurements
were done in triplicates.

All gel characterization experiments
were performed for As, P, Cd, and Cu. In the pH range of our characterization
experiments (3–8), these elements are predominantly present
as H2PO4–, HPO42–, H2AsO4–, HAsO42–, Cd2+, and Cu2+. Some experiments were also performed for Co and Zn (present
as Co2+ and Zn2+). Because no full data set
is available for the latter two analytes, this data is provided in
the Supporting Information (Table S-2 and
Figure S-3). Single-element stock solutions were prepared by dissolving
appropriate amounts of analytical grade Na2HAsO4 (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%), Cd(NO3)2·5H2O (Fluka, purum), CoSO4 (Sigma, >99%), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Fluka, puriss), KH2PO4 (Merck, pro analysi), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Fluka, purum) to give a stock
solution concentration of 100 mg L–1. Solutions
for DGT deployment were prepared from these stocks as single element
or mixed solutions depending on the experiment.

Preparation
of Diffusive and Resin Gels
Diffusive gels
with a thickness of 0.8 mm were prepared according to standard methods.7 We tried to develop a Zr-hydroxide and SPR-IDA
containing gel based on Ding et al.,26 who
describe a Zr-hydroxide-polyacrylamide resin gel for measuring phosphate.
However, the addition of Zr-hydroxide to the acrylamide gel solution,
both as dried and ground powder as described or as moist slurry, caused
rapid acrylamide polymerization and yielded a visibly inhomogeneous
Zr-hydroxide gel. Despite our efforts to improve the formulation of
the gel solution, we did not succeed in obtaining homogeneous resin
distribution using polyacrylamide hydrogels. It is possible that the
Zr-hydroxide particles interfered with the polymerization process,
as group III–VIII transition metals are known for their potential
to catalyze polymerization reactions.27 To overcome these problems, a urethane-based hydrogel (Hydromed
D4, Advan Source biomaterials, Massachusetts, US), which has not been
used for DGT gels so far, served as gel matrix for embedding the Zr-hydroxide
and SPR-IDA resins. This gel material is an ether-based hydrophilic
urethane polymer which does not require UV curing or a polymerization
reaction. The gel is formed upon solvent evaporation. We refer to
this novel resin gel as “high resolution mixed binding gel”
(HR-MBG) throughout this paper.

A total of 15 g of ZrOCl2·xH2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%)
was dissolved in 500 mL of laboratory water type 1. Zirconium hydroxide
precipitate was prepared by titrating this solution with a 0.1 mol
L–1 NaOH (Alfa Aesar, 99.99% metals basis) solution
under vigorous stirring until the pH stabilized at 7.0. The solution
containing the precipitated Zr-hydroxide was filtered using a vacuum
flask and a Buechner-funnel (VWR 454, quantitative filter paper).
Subsequently, the precipitated Zr-hydroxide was washed by adding 5
L of laboratory water type 1 to the funnel and sucking the water off
until only the slurry remained on the filter. The moist precipitate
was transferred into acid-washed containers and stored at 6 °C.
A batch of 15 g of ZrOCl2·xH2O yields approximately 140 g of precipitate (wet weight).

Ten grams of the hydrogel material Hydromed D4 was crushed to ∼5
mm pieces and dissolved in 100 mL of an ethanol (Sigma, Aldrich, puriss)-laboratory
water type 1 solution (10:1, v/v). Fifteen grams of the Zr-hydroxide
slurry was transferred into an acid washed polypropylene container.
Approximately 90 mL of Hydromed solution was added to yield 100 mL
of the Zr-hydroxide–Hydromed mixture. This mixture was homogenized
with a dispersing device (Ultra-Turrax T10 Basic, IKA-Werke GmbH &
CO. KG, Staufen, Germany) at ∼20,000 rpm for 5 min. One milliliter
of suspended particulate reagent iminodiacetic acid (SPR-IDA; CETAC
Technologies, Nebraska, US) resin was added to 9 mL of Zr-hydroxide–Hydromed
solution and vigorously shaken by hand for 3 min. This solution was
then fixed in an overhead-shaker and rotated at 2–3 rpm overnight
to eliminate air bubbles from the viscous gel solution.

An acid-washed
plastic spacer with a thickness of 0.25 mm was arranged
on a glass plate in a U-shape (approximately 6 × 20 cm in size)
and fixed on the outer side with small strips of adhesive tape. A
layer of hydrogel was coated onto a glass plate by consecutively applying
three thin layers of gel on top of each other. Therefore, approximately
3 mL of bubble-free gel solution was poured into the spacer and evenly
distributed within using a second glass plate as a coating tool. The
glass plate with the freshly coated gel solution was put into an oven
at 80 °C until the gel was dry (approximately 10 min). Afterward,
the hot glass plate was allowed to cool to room temperature in a clean
bench, and the coating process was repeated two more times to achieve
a triple coating. The triple-coated gel was allowed to cool to room
temperature. The spacer was removed, and the outer 2 mm of the gel
sheet was cut off using a razor blade to remove areas with inhomogeneous
resin distribution along the gel edges. The gel sheet with the glass
plate was put into 5 L laboratory water type 1 for at least 4 h to
hydrate. Afterward, it was gently detached from the glass plate using
tweezers and placed in a fresh water bath of 5 L laboratory water
type 1 for full hydration for 24 h.

With this procedure, a 100
μm-thick gel with highly homogeneous
resin distribution was produced. The thin gel is a result of solvent
removal during the drying process where the solvents, especially ethanol,
are evaporated at 80 °C. A circular metal die-cutter had to be
used to cut gel discs, as the gel is very stable and tear-proof. Teflon-coated
razor blades were used for cutting rectangular gel pieces. The hydrated
gel was stored in 10 mmol L–1 NaNO3 solution
at 6 °C.

DGT devices as provided by DGT Research Ltd. (Lancaster,
UK) were
used for the solution experiments. These samplers are designed to
host a sampling setup consisting of 0.4 mm of resin gel, 0.8 mm of
diffusive gel, and 0.14 mm of protective membrane. To compensate for
the HR-MBG gels being thinner than common resin gels, a 0.4 mm plastic
spacer was placed at the bottom of the sampler. This assembly was
used throughout the solution experiments. If only the gel discs were
deployed without the sampling device, this is noted in the experimental
description.

Digestion of Gel Discs and Matrix Evaporation
In preliminary
tests, we found poor reproducibility and low elution efficiencies
for elution of analytes from the HR-MBG in both, acidic and alkaline,
solutions. Therefore, the resin gels were subjected to microwave-assisted
digestion in 5 mL of HNO3 and 1 mL of H2O2 (Fluka, TraceSELECT) using a Multiwave 3000 (Anton Paar,
Graz, Austria) microwave instrument for measuring the amount of analyte
taken up by the gels. In this way, complete recovery of the analytes
was achieved (see Results and Discussion).
Moreover, a source of uncertainty for calculating cDGT, i.e., the analyte recovery factor, was eliminated.

The digests were diluted to achieve a HNO3 concentration
of ∼2% (m/m). In case this dilution step was expected to result
in analyte concentrations lower than 1 μg L–1, matrix evaporation of the digests was performed for preconcentrating
the analytes prior to analysis. The evaporation was done at 90 °C
for 15 h in perfluoroalkoxy-vials. Preconcentration factors of ∼18
were achieved in this way.

Analysis of Samples
The determination
of the elemental
concentration of liquid samples was performed on a Thermo Fisher ELEMENT
XR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) ICPMS. As internal
normalization standard 115In was found to be unsuitable,
because of Zr-based interferences arising due to the high Zr concentrations
in gel digests. Therefore, 72Ge and 89Y were
used as internal standards for all measurements. The certified reference
material SpS-SW2 (Surface Water Level 2, Batch 126, Spectrapure Standards,
Oslo, Norway) was measured together with a custom assurance standard
(SPEX CertiPrep, NJ, US) for validation.

Laser Ablation ICPMS
Chemical imaging was accomplished
by LA-ICPMS with a UP 193-FX (ESI, NWR Division, CA, US) laser ablation
system coupled to a NexION 300 ICPMS (Perkin-Elmer, MA, US). The quadrupole
ICPMS was chosen for the imaging experiment because of shorter measurement
cycles while providing enough sensitivity for the investigated analytes.

The laser spot size was set to 100 μm, the line scanning
speed to 100 μm s–1, the laser pulse frequency
to 15 Hz, and laser energy output to 15%, which equals 11–12
J cm–2. Helium was used as sample gas at a flow
rate of 0.9 L min–1. This gas stream was mixed with
the nebulizer gas stream (Ar 1 L min–1) prior to
introduction into the ICPMS.

The used settings were optimized
for an ablation area of 2.1 ×
3.5 cm, which was analyzed in a 4 h measurement run yielding ∼23,000
readings (including the washout periods after each line). The dwell
times of all analytes were adjusted to provide sufficient sensitivity.

The background equivalent concentrations (BEC) for all analytes
used in the chemical imaging experiment were determined. As internal
standard, 13C was chosen as has been done earlier for different
DGT gels.20,28 All signals were corrected for the gas blank.
Data processing was done in MS Excel, and visualization was performed
using the ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Maryland,
US), which is free to download at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij.

Preparation of Calibration Standards for LA-ICPMS
Standards
for LA-ICPMS were prepared by deploying HR-MBG gels in DGT samplers
in 3 L of deployment solution at varying analyte concentrations and
deployment times. Each treatment was replicated 4 times.

After
retrieval, one of the gels was put on a polycarbonate membrane (Nuclepore
Track-Etched Membrane 0.2 μm, Whatman, UK) and dried in a gel
drier (Unigeldryer 3545, Laborgeräte and Vertriebs GmbH, Martinsried,
Germany). The gel stuck inseparably to the membrane after drying.
This gluing effect prevented the gel from shrinking during the drying
process. The membrane with the dried HR-MBG was subsequently mounted
on a glass plate for laser ablation analysis.

The analyte loading
of the gel discs was determined by digestion
of the three remaining gels and measurements of the solutions by liquid
ICPMS. The corresponding LA-signal intensity was determined by measuring
4 lines on the remaining fourth gel with LA-ICPMS. Two horizontal
and two vertical lines were ablated over the gel disc. This method
of determining the gel loading and corresponding signal intensity
is a full matrix match of gel standards for laser ablation and gel
samples.

Characterization of DGT Performance
Gel Hydration
The hydration characteristics of the
resin gel were investigated by measuring the size of a gel strip with
a ruler after the removal of the gel sheets from the glass plate but
prior to any contact with water. The strips were placed subsequently
into laboratory water type 1, and the increase in length during gel
hydration after predetermined time intervals was measured.

Kinetics
of Uptake and Recovery of Analytes
Kinetics
of uptake were investigated by deploying HR-MBG discs in analyte solutions
and measuring the uptake of analytes. To investigate the recovery
of analytes, a mass balance was computed. The gel discs were placed
in vials containing 10 mL of uptake solution and were shaken on a
horizontal shaker during deployment. The uptake solution contained
580 ± 15 μg L–1 As, 590 ± 24 μg
L–1 P, 460 ± 9.0 μg L–1 Cd, 610 ± 15 μg L–1 Co, 540 ±
12 μg L–1 Cu, and 520 ± 4.6 μg
L–1 Zn at the beginning of the experiment. The gels
were exposed to the solution for time intervals of 1, 3, 6, 10, 30,
60, 120, 300, and 1440 min. The initial analyte concentration in solution
and the concentration of the solution after exposure to the discs
were measured to calculate the mass balance. The gel discs were digested,
and the digests were measured for their analyte concentrations. The
analyte recovery of the digestion procedure was determined.

Capacity
The capacity of the HR-MBG was determined
for Cd and P by deploying DGT samplers for 5 h in 3 L solutions containing
both P and Cd, at concentrations of 0.52, 1.32, 2.63, 7.37, 13.5,
19.4, 27.5, 36.8, and 46.1 mg L–1 P and 0.52, 1.29,
2.46, 7.13, 20.3, 37.0, 64.0, and 112.7 mg L–1 Cd.
Cd was chosen for determining the cation capacity, as the iminodiacetic
acid group has a relatively low selectivity toward Cd; therefore,
the determined capacity values are applicable to cations with higher
selectivity (Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Co).29 To
investigate Cd–P interactions that were observed at very high
ion concentrations, deployments in single-element solutions were also
performed. Therefore, solutions of 4.93, 14.2, 14.9, 23.4, and 38.9
mg L–1 P and solutions containing 15.7, 25.3, 49.9,
91.1, and 120 mg L–1 Cd were prepared separately.

pH, Ionic Strength, and Aging
Possible effects of solution
pH, ionic strength, and increasing gel age on the uptake of analytes
were tested by deploying DGT samplers for 5 h in 3 L analyte-containing
solutions (As, P, Cd, and Cu) with varying pH and ionic strength.

The pH of laboratory water type 1 with 10 mmol L–1 NaNO3 background concentration was adjusted to 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8 by adding 0.1 mol L–1 NaOH or HNO3 and letting the solution equilibrate several times (depending
on the pH change but at least two times) in the course of two days
under ambient conditions. When the pH had stabilized, the stock solutions
containing the analytes were added. Separate solutions for the anionic
and cationic species were prepared to prevent precipitation for the
experiments at pH 7 and 8. The pH was monitored throughout the experiment.

The ionic strength was adjusted to 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 mol
L–1 by adding NaNO3. All solutions had
a pH of 5.6 ± 0.2. The performance of the gels with increasing
age was investigated by deploying HR-MBG gels of one production batch
in DGT samplers into analyte solutions 14, 28, 47, and 91 days after
production. In all experiments, subsamples of the deployment solution
were taken at the beginning and the end of the experiment and measured
for their analyte concentrations.

Limit of Detection
and Limit of Quantification
The
limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined
by analyzing six blank HR-MBG discs after digestion. The measurement
for the analyte content used exactly the same sample preparation procedure
as for all other samples. The LOD was calculated by multiplying the
standard deviation of the blanks by a factor of 3 and the LOQ by a
factor of 10.30

Chemical Imaging of DGT-Labile
Anionic and Cationic Solute Species
in Soil
A plant experiment was conducted to demonstrate the
suitability of the HR-MBG for the simultaneous chemical imaging of
anions and cations in soil. The procedure followed the work of Santner
et al.;9 an overview is given in Figure
S-1, Supporting Information. A flat growth
box (termed rhizotron) with a removable front window was filled with
a Cambisol topsoil31 from a fertilized
agricultural plot (“Spöcklberg”, Lamprechtshausen,
Austria). The soil surface was covered by a layer of a 10 μm-thick
polycarbonate membrane (Nuclepore, Whatman, UK) to protect the plant
roots when opening the rhizotron for gel application.

For solute
sampling, the soil was moistened to 30% maximum water holding capacity
by adding water through irrigation holes located at the back side
of the rhizotron. A Zea mays L. seedling was transplanted
to the rhizotron just after the first root tip had emerged from the
seed. After 5 days of growth, the rhizotron was carefully opened and
the soil was water-saturated by adding water through hoses attached
to the irrigation holes. An approximately 3 × 5 cm large piece
of HR-MBG was placed onto the membrane-covered soil surface across
a living root. In addition to protecting the root, the polycarbonate
membrane also served as a 10 μm thick diffusion layer. For reducing
image blurring by lateral diffusion of P in the diffusion layer, no
additional diffusive gel was used. Afterward, the rhizotron was closed
by putting the cover plate back in place. Thereby, gentle pressure
was applied to the HR-MBG, ensuring close contact of the soil, the
Nuclepore membrane, and the resin gel. As thin films of the HR-MBG
are semitransparent, the entrapment of air bubbles between soil, membrane,
and gel could be excluded by visual inspection. Analyte uptake was
allowed for 24 h. Afterward, the HR-MBG was retrieved from the rhizotron
and dried as mentioned earlier.

Results and Discussion
Gel Properties
The newly developed procedure of coating
ether-based urethane polymer resin gels containing SPR-IDA and zirconium-hydroxide
results in ultrathin (∼100 μm) and highly stable gels.
Ultrathin gels allow for the application of a second layer of a planar
sensor at the back of the resin gel, for example, a second DGT gel
or a planar optode.32 In a dual-layer setup,
a thin first sampling layer is vital for minimizing image blurring
in the underlying second layer by diffusive relaxation during analyte
passage through the first layer. Compared with the acrylamide-based
∼100 μm thick DGT gel described by Lehto et al.,28 our ether-based urethane polymer gel is much
more stable and tear-proof and requires no supporting membranes during
gel handling.

Gel Hydration
Hydrogels swell once
placed in water.33 The hydration characteristics
of the HR-MBG
are shown in Figure S-2, Supporting Information. The maximum expansion was reached after 24 h at 135% (STD = 0.2%, n = 3) of the initial gel size. Similar to common diffusive
gels based on acrylamide, the resin gel was fully hydrated within
one day and did not show any change in size during a further one-week
period. Thus, we recommend gel hydration for 24 h in 5 L of laboratory
water type 1 and changing the water once.

Kinetics of Uptake and
Analyte Recovery
The mass of
analytes bound onto the HR-MBG increased linearly for the first 60
min after which the binding rate decreased as the solution approached
total depletion (Figure 1). Maximum uptake
was reached after 300 min when the deployment solutions were effectively
free of analytes. The analyte uptake rates of the HR-MBG were similar
to values reported by Mason et al.22 Therefore,
it is concluded that there is no kinetic limitation of uptake. The
HR-MBG thus acts as an infinite sink which is a prerequisite for its
use in DGT deployments.

Figure 1 Uptake of As, P, Cd, and Cu onto gel discs from
multielement solutions
containing 4.6 μg of Cd, 5.4 μg of Cu, 5.8 μg of
As, and 5.9 μg of P in 10 mL after immersion for 1, 3, 6, 10,
30, 60, 120, and 300 min (1440 min not shown here). The dotted line
shows the content of analyte in μg in the 10 mL of uptake solution.
Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean (n = 3).

The digestion followed by sample
dilution and, if necessary, matrix
evaporation, showed analyte recoveries of 103 ± 5% for As, 95
± 11% for P, 107 ± 6% for Cd, and 100 ± 8% for Cu (STD, n = 21). These values are very close to 100% recovery, and
their standard deviations are in the range of values reported for
other resin gels with complete analyte recovery by acid elution.6,9,34 To our knowledge, a full acid
digestion of resin gels using microwave-assisted digestion has not
been used so far. Complete recovery was achieved with open digestion
systems on two occasions.34,35 We adopt 100% recovery
for the applied digestion procedure as the standard deviations in
the recoveries overlap the 100% margin for all but Cd where the recovery
was slightly higher.

Capacity
A region of linear DGT
uptake of P and Cd
was observed for single element solutions as well as for the solutions
containing both species (Figure 2). The uptake
of P onto the HR-MBG followed the theoretically predicted values up
to ∼7 μg cm–2 (0.23 μmol cm–2) P and ∼35 μg cm–2 (0.31 μmol cm–2) Cd, calculated as accumulated
mass divided by the total gel disc area (here 4.52 cm2).
These values were adopted as maximum gel capacities. For comparability,
the reported literature values were recalculated to values based on
the total gel disk area. In single element solutions containing either
Cd or P, further uptake above this threshold was lower than theoretically
expected on the basis of the calculation of mass uptake according
to eq 1. However, in multielement solutions
containing Cd and P, Cd uptake according to eq 1 beyond the determined capacity was observed. For P, no such increased
uptake was seen; however, at high Cd and P concentrations (>35
mg
L–1 P, >35 mg L–1 Cd), a sharp
decrease of P uptake was observed. The increased Cd uptake in the
presence of phosphate could be caused by changes in the surface charge
of the Zr-hydroxide surface. Phosphate ions binding to the Zr-hydroxide
will render the average surface charge more negative, which could
lead to Cd binding to the hydroxide. The decrease in phosphate uptake
seems to be an interactive effect that is caused by the high external
Cd concentrations. Similar interactions were recently reported for
a Chelex 100–ferrihydrite resin gel, where the As uptake decreased
in the presence of metal cations (Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb).36 However, we did not study these interactions further as
they only occurred at very high external Cd and P concentrations,
which are unlikely to occur even in highly contaminated or overfertilized
environments. In uncontaminated, natural soils, solute concentrations
of the analytes targeted by this resin gel are often in the range
of 0.1–500 μg L–1.37 In such environments, interactive effects as seen in this
experiment should not occur. Measurements in highly contaminated environments
at high solute concentrations, however, require thorough evaluation.

Figure 2 Capacity
of the gel for P and Cd. Measurement after 5 h of deployment
in P- and Cd-containing solutions at various concentrations (open
symbols) and single element solutions (filled symbols). The solid
line shows the theoretically accumulated mass in DGT samplers according
to eq 1. Error bars represent the standard deviation
of the mean (n = 3). The dotted lines represent the
maximum capacity defined for the HR-MBG.

Given the lower affinity of the iminodiacetic acid group29 for Cd2+ compared to Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, the Cd capacity determined
here is also the capacity threshold for these other ion species. Furthermore,
as the phosphate concentration in uncontaminated environments is usually
much higher than the arsenate concentration and the affinity of Zirconium
hydroxide/oxide for both ion species is similar, the determined capacity
for P is also the capacity threshold for As.38

The P capacity of the HR-MBG with 7 μg cm–2 is similar to that of a gel containing precipitated ferrihydrite
(6.94 μg cm–2),9 higher than conventional ferrihydrite gels (1.36 μg cm–2),6 and a mixed binding
layer also based on ferrihydrite (2.45 μg cm–2)22 but lower than a high-capacity gel
based on Zr-hydroxide/oxide (∼100 μg cm–2).26 The Cd capacity with 35 μg
cm–2 (0.31 μmol cm–2) is
significantly lower than for standard Chelex 100 gels (∼115
μg cm–2).7 Compared
with another mixed binding gel described by Mason et al. (15.3 μg
Mn cm–2 ≙ 0.28 μmol cm–2) the capacity seems slightly higher, however, not considering that
the affinity of Chelex for Mn is lower than for Cd.22 Despite the lower cation capacity compared to standard
Chelex gels, our gel has sufficient capacities of As, Cd, P, and Cu
for deployment in uncontaminated environments.

pH, Ionic Strength, and
Aging
DGT-measured element
concentrations agreed well with the directly measured deployment solution
concentrations in a range of pH 4–8 (Figure 3). At pH 3, Cd uptake was strongly reduced, which is in line
with the known pH dependency of Cd sorption by iminodiacetic acid.
The uptake of P, As, and Cu at pH 3 was close to 100%. Due to its
high affinity to the iminodiacetic acid group,29 Cu was still taken up quantitatively at this low pH.

shown as the ratio of cDGT to the deployment
solution concentration (cSOL) affected
by (a) pH, (b) ionic strength, and (c) age of
the gel. The dotted lines denote the range of 1 ± 0.1. Error
bars represent the standard deviation of the mean (n = 3).

The performance of the HR-MBG
was affected only at high ionic strengths.
In the ionic strength range of 0.001 to 0.1 mol L–1, the uptake was within expectations (Figure 3).9,26 At an ionic strength of 0.5 mol L–1, however, the uptake of the anions P and As decreased to about 80%
while the uptake of the cations Cd and Cu was still ∼100%.
These results agree well with previous work.39

For the storage times tested, the recovery of analytes was
in the
acceptable range of ±10% for the first 14 days with a slight
increase in variation up to 47 days. After longer storage, the difference
of the cDGT values and the directly measured
concentrations, as well as the standard deviation of the cDGT concentrations, increased considerably (Figure 3). These results suggest that the HR-MBG should
be used within 47 days after production to obtain an optimal DGT response
for all tested analytes.

Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantification
Blank
values, limits of detection, and limits of quantification for the
measurements of digested gels and LA-ICPMS measurements are given
in Table 1. The blank levels of P and Cd with
130 and 70 ng cm–2, respectively, were higher than
those of Cu and As. The investigation of all the chemicals used showed
small, but stable, background concentrations of P (40 ± 4 μg
g–1) and Cd (3.1 ± 0.7 μg g–1) in the ether-based urethane polymer material (Hydromed D4). This
background can be considerably reduced (to 65 ng cm–2 P and 20 ng cm–2 Cd) by washing Hydromed in laboratory
grade water (1:15, m/v) with 4 successive water changes on a shaker
prior to gel production. The swelling of the Hydromed during washing
has to be compensated by drying at 80 °C for 15 h with compensation
of the net weight loss by adding laboratory water type 1. However,
the blank levels were homogenously distributed on the gel and stable
between gels from different production batches; therefore, they are
compensated for by blank correction. The BEC levels for the LA-ICPMS
analysis are given in Table 1 and are in the
same range as the blank levels as determined by digestion and measurement
of blank HR-MBG gels.

LA-ICPMS Calibration
Two exemplary
laser ablation calibrations
for 63Cu and 65Cu are shown in Figure 4. All slopes and regression coefficients are given
in Table S-1, Supporting Information. The
calibration lines were computed for 6 calibration standards. The working
range was estimated on the basis of preliminary experiments and expected
concentrations of target analytes in the respective soil. The selected
working range allowed for a linear calibration of LA-ICPMS measurements
which is not necessarily the case for this type of measurement.9 The error bars in both, the x and y, directions clearly show that a reliable
calibration based on DGT gels requires several data points over the
concentration range.

Figure 4 Exemplary calibration for 63Cu and 65Cu measured
with LA-ICPMS. Error bars on the x axis represent
the standard deviation of three replicates of digested standard gels.
Error bars on the y axis represent the standard deviation
of the measured Cu/13C signal on the standard gel.

Chemical Imaging of Anions
and Cations in Soil and the Rhizosphere
For DGT chemical
imaging, the use of very thin diffusion layers
(10 μm in this study) is necessary to minimize lateral solute
diffusion in the diffusion layer and thus image blurring. However,
the solute mass accumulated on DGT samplers with thin diffusion layers
will not increase proportionally compared to the standard diffusion
layer thickness (∼940 μm) if desorption from soil governs
the solute supply to the DGT sampler. Lehto et al. showed this effect
for DGT measurements of Cu and Cd on two soils, where the accumulated
mass increased ∼3-fold at most for a 80-fold in decrease in
Δg.28cDGT values calculated for thin diffusion layers will therefore
often be unusually low compared to the standard Δg, which can cause confusion if DGT chemical images are reported as cDGT values. Generally, the interpretation of
DGT chemical images is often done based on the relative distribution
of the analytes rather than on absolute concentrations. To avoid misinterpretation,
the effect of decreased Δg should be pointed
out when reporting DGT images as cDGT values.
Alternatively, images can be given as fDGT values, which show the actual flux that may be increased for thin
Δg, but which are not normalized for the diffusion
layer thickness (cf. Equations 1 and 2).

Chemical images of the distribution of P,
As, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn in the rhizosphere of Z. mays L. are shown in Figure 5 as fDGT values. A line scan raster of 69 laser lines (300
μm line spacing) with 287 readings along each line was measured
on the dried resin gel, resulting in a 19,803 pixel image for every
measured isotope. This equals a spatial resolution of 122 × 300
μm. If required, the spatial resolution in LA-ICPMS analysis
can be increased considerably. It is important to note, however, that
the achievable spatial resolution is in most cases limited by the
homogeneity of the resin distribution in the DGT gel and diffusive
blurring during analyte uptake and not by the instrumental resolution
limits of ∼2 μm.40 With these
features, the HR-MBG is a novel gel with the unique capability of
simultaneously sampling cationic and anionic solute species for high
resolution chemical imaging in porous media. The more complicated
gel preparation compared to other cation and anion binding gels and
the need for microwave-assisted digestion render the HR-MBG a specialized
gel for DGT imaging applications.

Figure 5 A photograph of a root grown in a rhizotron
soil (IMG) is shown
along with chemical images obtained by DGT–LA-ICPMS of P, Mn,
Zn, Cu, Co, As, and Cd. The fDGT concentrations
were calculated on the basis of eq 2. The image
for As is not calibrated here and thus shows the relative intensity
of the As signal. LOD denotes the limit of detection; WR denotes the
upper limit of the working range.

It can be seen that the analytical approach leads to 2D images
providing sufficient resolution for further interpretation. As expected,
phosphorus is depleted near the maize root in a very narrow area.13,41 The depletion zone of Mn was larger, extending about 1 mm into the
soil. DGT-labile Mn was strongly depleted in the center of this zone
and showed a clear gradient into the surrounding bulk soil. Zinc was
depleted in a very narrow area just along the root. Interestingly,
we observed concentration hotspots of Cu and Zn, most of them not
located in direct vicinity of the root. Although we can only speculate
about their origin, hotspots of microbial activity and their complex
interactions mobilizing these metals during, e.g., the decomposition
of organic matter seem to be a likely explanation for this observation,
similar to trace metal mobilization in sediments.16,17,42 The loading of Co on the DGT gel was below
the working range for large parts of the image. Nevertheless, we were
able to observe Co depletion in a zone of about 1 mm around the root.
The mapping of As was initially not considered for calibration due
to the very low concentrations expected in this soil. However, the
images of Co and As still reveal that even at very low count rates
close to the LOD a depletion zone can be distinguished from the bulk
soil and chemical imaging can visualize the removal of elements in
the rhizosphere even at very low concentration.

Conclusions
We developed a novel DGT resin gel, the HR-MBG, which facilitates
the simultaneous high-resolution LA-ICPMS imaging of anionic and cationic
solutes. It is the first DGT gel employing an ether-based urethane
polymer hydrogel (Hydromed D4). Thin layers (100 μm) of this
gel are highly tear-proof and geometrically stable, rendering Hydromed
D4 superior to thin polyacrylamide gel layers. This material may also
serve as matrix for other thin-layer DGT gels. We report on performance
tests of the novel HR-MBG for the anions As and P and the cations
Cd and Cu, but the resins used (SPR-IDA, Zr-hydroxide) make the gel
suitable for a large variety of ion species. The gel can be used in
similar environmental conditions as existing DGT gels (pH 4–8,
ionic strength of 1–100 mmol L–1). The shelf
life of the HR-MBG is 47 days, and the capacity is sufficiently high
for deployment in uncontaminated natural environments with a normal
range of solute concentrations of the target ions. With these features,
the new HR-MBG is well suited for the accurate, simultaneous analysis
of cation and anion distribution at high spatial resolution by LA-ICPMS.
