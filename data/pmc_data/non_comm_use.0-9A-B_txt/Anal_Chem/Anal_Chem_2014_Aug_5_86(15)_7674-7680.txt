Bacterial
systems are being extensively studied and modified for
energy, sensors, and industrial chemistry; yet, their molecular scale
structure and activity are poorly understood. Designing efficient
bioengineered bacteria requires cellular understanding of enzyme expression
and activity. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was modified to detect
and analyze the activity of redox active enzymes expressed on the
surface of E. coli. An insulated gold-coated metal
microwire with only the tip conducting was used as an AFM cantilever
and a working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell.
Bacteria were engineered such that alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADHII)
was surface displayed. A quinone, an electron transfer mediator, was
covalently attached site specifically to the displayed ADHII. The
AFM probe was used to lift a single bacterium off the surface for
electrochemical analysis in a redox-free buffer. An electrochemical
comparison between two quinone containing mutants with different distances
from the NAD+ binding site in alcohol dehydrogenase II
was performed. Electron transfer in redox active proteins showed increased
efficiency when mediators are present closer to the NAD+ binding site. This study suggests that an integrated conducting
AFM used for single cell electrochemical analysis would allow detailed
understanding of enzyme electron transfer processes to electrodes,
the processes integral to creating efficiently engineered biosensors
and biofuel cells.

==== Body
Understanding
the electrical
and chemical activity of individual cells will play a critical role
in designing and developing future bioelectronics. High-resolution
functional imaging is critical for understanding molecular scale activity
and its underlying structural substrate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
allows for high resolution imaging as well as simultaneous study of
various physicochemical properties.1−9 Coupling of AFM and electrochemical analysis (EC) has been developed,
although mostly for measuring the conductance in nonliving systems.10−12 It has been used to study diffusional species in solution with the
imaged substrate surface acting as a working electrode for self-assembled
monolayers on the surface13 and the switch
of redox states of a single metallo-protein bound to the surface.14 Recently, EC-AFM has been used for potential
dependent adsorption/desorption of inorganic molecules.15 However, selective removal of a single cell
from a surface and subsequent electrochemical study of a specific
redox protein expressed by the cells has not been reported.

Nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) serves as a cofactor
in over 300 redox enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADHII),
the enzyme of interest in the bacterial system studied here. These
dehydrogenases are being used in catalytic electrochemical oxidation
processes in biosensors and in biofuel cells among other bioelectronic
applications. The large overpotentials that are needed to oxidize
NADH to NAD+ render it useless for these purposes.16 To overcome overpotentials, it was suggested
to modify the surface of an electrode with quinones.17 In this study and others, the possibility of covalent incorporation
of electron-transfer mediating groups attached to the surface of the
electrode was suggested and studied. Other studies have demonstrated
a remarkable decrease in overpotentials needed for NADH oxidation.18,19

We have previously developed a novel approach for bacterial
redox
enzyme modification and expression.20 We
have shown that these engineered bacteria can be successfully used
in a biofuel cell and can even be used as active and viable biocatalysts
for more than a week with relatively high power outputs. Briefly, E. coli was modified to display the redox enzyme, ADHII,
on the surface using an autodisplay system.21 The unnatural amino acid para-azido-l-phenylalanine (Az)
was incorporated into a specific site of the enzyme using the stop
codon suppression strategy.22 When attached
to Az a quinone facilitates electron transfer between the enzyme and
an electrode. In order to attach the bacteria carrying the surface
displayed enzyme to a surface, a quinone linker 1 containing
an alkyne and a thiol moiety on opposite ends (1) was
synthesized and attached to the dehydrogenase site specifically through
a copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction.23 Using this approach, we were able to covalently
link bacteria to gold-coated surfaces. The orientation of the redox
enzyme on the surface of the electrode can be controlled, and the
distances for electron transfer between the enzyme active site and
the electrode surface are predetermined.

In order to enable
the characterization of the bacterial surface
and its electrochemical properties, we have coupled the imaging abilities
of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with those of electrochemical techniques.
The AFM cantilever, coated in gold and insulated such that the tip
is the conducting surface, served both as an imaging probe and as
a working electrode in the electrochemical cell. The bacteria express
ADHII with a linker 1 attached site specifically to their
surface. An exposed thiol on the linker 1 facilitates
the gold AFM cantilever attachment to the bacteria. This novel approach
was created to determine: (1) What will happen if a quinone is covalently
attached site specifically into a predetermined site, in a hydrogenase
that uses NAD+ as its cofactor. (2) How it will affect
its oxidation overpotentials. (3) How the distance of the NAD+ from the electrode surface will affect its electron transfer
(ET) properties. Utilizing our modified AFM probes, we successfully
imaged and measured the electrochemical activity of a single bacterium
with different ADHII mutants. Through these studies, we demonstrated
improved activity in ADHII mutants with electron transfer mediators
close to the NAD+ binding site. This approach for studying
enzymes can be applied and adapted to study the electrochemistry of
other redox enzymes and electrogenic bacteria as well as synthetic
electrochemically active nano/microparticles.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Reagents
All chemical reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Rehovot, Israel) or Acros (Geel, Belgium) and
used without further purification. The unnatural amino acid AzPhe
was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). PCR was performed
with the Kapa HiFi PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA). Plasmid
DNA isolation was performed with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany). Oligonucleotides were supplied by Sigma (Rehovot,
Israel) and by IDT (Jerusalem, Israel).

Modified Bacteria Preparations
A full description of
modified bacteria can be found in our previous report.20 Briefly, site-directed mutagenesis on pJM7-ADH
(plasmid encoding for Autodisplay of ADHII) was performed using a
QuikChange II kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
using the primers for PCR, containing mutation sites for ADHIIV66Az
or for ADHIID314Az. (A full list of primers is depicted in ref (20).)

Surface Modifications
Glass microscope slides (Marienfeld,
Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) were cleaned using the UVOCS ozone
cleaning system (Lansdale, PA) for 10 min. A 5 nm chromium adhesion
layer and a 20 nm gold layer were deposited using K575X sputter coater
(Quorum Technologies, Kent, UK). Bacteria were attached to the surface
as described in ref (20).

Preparation of AFM Probe/Working Electrode
The AFM
probe was created utilizing a sharp tungsten wire coated in epoxylite
with a shaft diameter of 40 μm (FHC, Bowdoin, ME). Gold was
sputtered onto the wire to a thickness of 25–50 nm. The wire
was reinsulated through 3 coatings with ClearClad HSR (Chicago, IL)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The wire was attached
to a custom cantilever holding chip, and a gold mirror was affixed
for laser detection with Two-Ton Epoxy (Devcon, Danvers, MA).

AFM Sequence
of Operations and Imaging
Images and adhesion
measurements were taken with a Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope V controller
(Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA). Images were taken with a custom tungsten
probe (k = ∼10 N/m) in contact mode with the
force minimized to reduce damage to the bacteria. Bacteria were imaged
at scan rates of 2–5 Hz. The probe was then zoomed onto a single
bacteria, and the scan area was set to 0 μm2. After
localization of bacteria, force images were taken with ramp sizes
of 500 nm. The probe remained in contact with the surface with a constant
force when initial electrochemical measurements were taken.

Electrochemical
Measurements
An EMstat3+ potentiostat was used
(PalmSens BV, The Netherlands) for cyclic
voltammetric measurements. A three-electrode electrochemical cell
was assembled where the working electrode was a Tungsten AFM tip coated
with gold (Scheme 2). The reference electrode
was Ag/AgCl wire prepared by electroplating in 1 M KCl for 30 min
at 1 V. The wire was prepared as a reference electrode daily prior
to all experiments to reduce electrical drift; a reference solution
of 1:1 ratio 10 mM Fe(CN)63–/4– in TRIS buffer was made and used daily to verify the reference potential
of the reference electrode (Figure S3, Supporting
Information). The reference electrode was present with a large
junction to allow a large access area. The counter electrode was a
platinum wire. All electrodes were assembled in a liquid AFM cell
(Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with several pores for electrodes.
The working volume was ca. 100 μL. Electrolyte solution was
0.1 M Tris buffer, pH = 8.0. Measurements were conducted in the range
of −0.8 to 0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl with varying scan rates. Electrode
surface area determinations were conducted using a 10 mM solution
of Fe(CN)63–/4– (1:1 ratio mixed
solution), in a range of (−0.1) to (+0.6) V vs Ag/AgCl. Cathodic peaks determination
was done by drawing a baseline between forward and reverse curves
and measuring the region with the largest current from the baseline
for each scan rate. The potential at the largest current point was
determined as the cathodic potential, and the current at that point
was determined as the cathodic peak current.

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical
Cell Configuration
The electrochemical
cell was configured with the gold coated tungsten microwire acting
as a cantilever tip while serving as the working electrode in the
three-electrode electrochemical cell. The probe was insulated to limit
the active electrode area to the tip of the probe (described in the Experimental Section). Platinum and Ag/AgCl wires
acted as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively (Scheme 1). The Ag/AgCl wire was placed directly in contact
with the fluid creating a large access junction to prevent junction
clogging as would occur in a small junction glass electrode.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Description of the EC-AFM Setup
The materials for the electrodes,
reference (RE), working (WE), and counter (CE), were Ag/AgCl, Au,
and platinum, respectively.

Imaging of Bacteria
Three different mutants of alcohol
dehydrogenase II (ADHII) were displayed on the surface of E. coli. Each mutant was generated with varying distances
from the NAD+ binding pocket; mutants V66Az and P182Az
were generated with approximate distances of ∼5 Å each
from the binding pocket and mutant D314Az with a distance of ∼42
Å from the binding pocket (Figure S1, Supporting
Information). In this study, we have excluded mutant P182Az
as V66Az is a similar distance (∼5 Å) from the NAD+ binding pocket. The modified bacteria were covalently attached
to gold-sputtered glass slides via linker 1. Slides with
attached bacteria were imaged with the wire AFM cantilever. Figure 1A shows an image of multiple bacteria on the surface
of a slide. A bacterium was localized with the AFM for subsequent
electrochemical analysis. Figure 1B–D
shows individual bacterium of different mutants, V66Az, D314Az, and
wild type bacteria (WT), selected for electrochemical measurements.
The presence of bacteria on the gold substrates was confirmed with
light microscopy imaging (Figure 1E).

(B), D314Az (C), and WT (D). (E) Light microscopy images of bacteria

Picking up a Single Bacterium
A bacterium was picked
up by the conducting AFM probe through the following steps as summarized
in Scheme 2. After
localization of a bacterium, the gold-coated conducting AFM probe
was allowed to remain in controlled contact with the bacterium surface
without imaging to facilitate gold–thiol bond formation between
the linker 1 site specifically attached to ADHII and
the probe for ∼5 min (Scheme 2B). The
chemical structure of the thiol containing linker 1 is
shown in the inset of Scheme 2. The tip was
then disengaged from the surface (Scheme 2C).
Successful attachment of the bacterium to the tip inhibited reimaging
of the surface. This was further confirmed through observed changes
in cyclic voltammograms. The activity of the probe before imaging
the bacteria was recorded (Figure 2, background).
During the selection of a single bacterium, electrochemical measurements
were conducted to check whether electrochemical activity could be
detected (Figure 2, surface mode). This served
as our first indication of a successful transfer of a bacterium from
the surface to the tip. Upon selecting and attaching a bacterium to
the AFM tip, we commenced with our electrochemical analysis of electron
transfer (ET) processes (Figure 2, withdrawn
mode). Coupling both the AFM imaging abilities with the electrochemical
signals demonstrated that we have collected a redox active bacterium
off the surface. However, this did not exclude the possibility that
only part of the bacteria was removed.

a Single Bacterium off the Surface Using an AFM Gold Coated Tip

mode of bacterium selection.
Background: before engaging the surface. Surface mode: engaging with
a single bacterium. Withdrawn mode: withdrawing upon attachment of
a bacterium. Scan rates were 0.05 V s–1; reference
electrode: Ag/AgCl wire.

In order to ascertain gold–thiol bond formation between
the enzymes on the bacterial surface and the cantilevered tip, we
measured the adhesion forces while engaging a single bacterium. Figure 3 shows examples of the measured adhesion using the
force mode for mutants D314Az and V66Az. As a control measurement,
adhesion forces were also measured for a bare Au surface. In addition,
only upon observing these adhesion forces could electrochemical activity
be detected on the surface of the AFM tip (serving as our working
electrode). Combining all this evidence together with the actual size
of our working electrode (ca. 100 μm2) indicates
that the probe and system is capable of picking up a single bacterium
or a fragment. Control experiments conducted with surfaces modified
with WT nonmodified bacteria that were nonspecifically bound to the
surface as well as surface modified bacteria displaying WT-ADHII did
not yield any visible electrochemical signals. This occurred neither
when the probe engaged the bacteria on the surface nor when the probe
was subsequently withdrawn.

Figure 3 AFM retraction curves are shown for ADHII mutants
V66Az and D314Az
during cantilever attachment to a single bacterium. Adhesion forces
are visible for both mutants. Bare gold substrates are shown as a
control.

Determination of Electrode
Size and Surface Coverage
Due to the fabrication processes
and customization of the working
electrodes for AFM, there existed heterogeneity in electrode surface
areas. In order to avoid large differences between the measured surfaces,
we have used a 10 mM solution of Fe(CN)63–/4– for an initial determination of our actual active surface, basing
our calculations on the Randles-Sevcik equation for diffusional species.
Thus, tips that have shown large redox currents indicating surface
areas larger than 100 μm2 were excluded.

Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms collected using
a mutant V66Az modified AFM tip (lavender colored line), a mutant
D314Az modified tip (rose colored line), and a background measurement
of the unmodified working electrode (lime green colored line) collected
at a scan rate of 0.05 V s–1. When studying the electrochemical
properties of linker 1, based on eq 1, plotted Ip values against scan rates
determined a surface coverage of Γ = 2.3 × 10–10 mol·cm–2. However, surface coverage values
calculated for the surface modified bacteria containing linker 1 bound to the surface of the electrode yielded values of
Γo = 8.0 × 10–11 mol·cm–2 and ΓR = 1.0 × 10–11 mol·cm–2 for mutant V66Az, oxidized and reduced
forms, respectively, whereas the values of surface coverage for mutant
D314Az were Γo = 2.7 × 10–11 mol·cm–2 and ΓR = 8.0 ×
10–12 mol·cm–2, for the oxidized
and reduced forms. The much lower conversion values for the mutants, compared to those
measured for linker 1 by itself, suggest that there is
an additional process that is involved, namely, the redox reaction
of NADH. Taking into account the redox potential measured for mutant
D314Az and the fact that it is identical to the redox potential of
linker 1, but with much lower reversibility, it is suggested
that the degree of mediation of ET between NAD+ and the
quinone containing linker is much lower than for mutant V66Az.

Figure 4 Cyclic voltammograms
of the different mutants; lavender colored
line: mutant V66Az; rose colored line: mutant D314Az; lime green colored
line: background measurement with an unmodified working electrode.
Scan rates were 0.05 V s–1; reference electrode:
Ag/AgCl wire.

Using the calculated values based on eq 1 and knowing the approximate surface area of our
electrode, we could
estimate the number of active enzymes bound to the surface. 1  where Ip is the
current at the peak (anodic peak or cathodic peak), n is the number of electrons in the reaction, F is
the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin (in this case, 298 K), A is the electrode surface area in cm2, Γ
is the surface coverage in mol·cm–2 for the
anodic or the cathodic process, and ν is the potential scan
rate in V s–1.

These values can be translated
to the number of redox active enzyme
copies displayed per bacterium that varied between ∼160 000
copies for bacteria displaying mutant D314Az and ∼480 000
copies for bacteria displaying mutant V66Az. These numbers are in
good agreement with the reported performance of the bacterial autodisplay
system.24 However, these numbers do not
agree with our previously reported numbers based on our attachment
of gold nanoparticles to the enzymes and a cautious count of the number
of nanoparticles, when we reported an approximate 11 000 copies
per cell.20 The difference could stem from
several reasons: one was our avoidance of counting gold nanoparticles
that have aggregated, and another could be that gold nanoparticles
failed to bind all displayed enzymes.

ET Measurements and Mutants
Comparison
We have used
Laviron’s analytical approach for cases of peak to peak separation
of ΔEp > 200 mV/n (n being the number of electrons)25 to calculate
the transfer coefficient α and the apparent rate constant kapp for mutants V66Az and D314Az. We did not
conduct calculations for mutant P182Az since it has exhibited similar
peak potentials as mutant V66Az, probably due to similar distances
from the NAD+ binding pocket. Figure 5A shows the voltammograms collected upon picking up a bacterium that
displayed ADHII mutant V66Az on its surface. Due to very low peak
currents compared to catalytic currents present in the voltammograms,
we are not showing the full range of potentials that were scanned
in each experiment, only the region in which the peaks have appeared
(the full scale voltammograms are shown in Figure S2A, Supporting Information). For mutant V66Az, the
formal potential, E0′ was calculated
to be −250 mV vs Ag/AgCl. This relatively high potential is
an indication that indeed the electrons are being transferred from
NADH through the quinone and not just from the quinone that is directly
bound to the surface. The middle point potential that was measured
for the quinone used in this study is −350 mV vs Ag/AgCl (Figure
S2B, Supporting Information). Transfer
coefficients α and 1 – α were calculated to be
0.4 and 0.6, respectively, whereas kapp, the electron transfer rate constant, varied in the different measurements
between 5.6 and 7.2 s–1. These values are in good
agreement with values reported in the literature for electrodes modified
with quinone derivatives to mediate NADH enzymatic oxidation, where
the enzymes were randomly oriented relative to the electrode.26 These values are significantly higher than values
reported for ADH/toluidine blue O/nafion electrodes modified nonspecifically,
at a value of 0.12 s–1.19

Figure 5 (A)

mutant V66Az. (B) Cyclic voltammograms conducted under different scan
rates for mutant D314Az. The range was limited to emphasize the peaks.
The full scale is shown in Figure S2A,B, Supporting
Information.

The same measurements
were conducted with surfaces modified with
bacteria displaying mutant D314Az (Figure 5B). The measured formal potential was E0′ = −350 mV vs Ag/AgCl. Since this potential is the same as
the one that we have measured for linker 1 alone, we
assume that we have measured in this case the ET process between the
quinone and the electrode almost exclusively without the ability to
successfully mediate ET between the quinone and the NAD+ in the remote binding pocket. Using Laviron’s approach for
the analysis of the ET process for this mutant, the transfer coefficients,
α and 1 – α, were calculated to be 0.15 and 0.85,
respectively. The measured kapp was 1.2–1.5
s–1. Here, we must note that the measurements for
the cathodic peaks of both mutants were done by a mathematical deconvolution
(detailed explanation appears in the Experimental
Section) due to reductive catalytic peaks that appeared in
more negative potentials probably due to bacterial lysis on the surface.
Furthermore, due to a very small number of redox active molecules
on the surface (in the range of hundreds of thousands only per measurement),
measured currents are extremely low, in the picoampere range, the
limit of our measuring abilities. Nonetheless, in the region of middle
point potentials, a marked increase in capacitive currents was observed,
which lead us to believe that a Faradaic process is taking place in
that region. Lysis of bacteria may occur due to large forces applied
to bacteria by the AFM tip during imaging caused by the relatively
high stiffness of the probe.

The kapp value calculated for linker 1 when it was bound to
the electrode surface varied between
5.75 and 7.5 s–1 in our different measurements with
a surface coverage that is about 2.3 × 10–10 mol·cm–2, whereas surface coverage of mutant
D314Az was an order of magnitude lower, with a much lower ET rate
constant (within the error of the measurement). This value is lower
than that calculated for mutant V66Az, where the mediated ET is evident
due to the very low conversion rate between oxidized and reduced forms
as well as the positively shifted middle point potential. All of these
results together strengthen our conclusion that the NADH is hardly
involved in this reaction (using mutant D314Az) since it is too far
(at least 42 Å away from the quinone). Our earlier studies with
the same mutants have shown much lower bioelectrocatalytic activity
for mutant D314Az.20

Conclusions
Using an integrated conducting AFM for single cell electrochemical
analysis, we were able to obtain a detailed understanding of enzyme
electron transfer processes to electrodes. We were able to determine
the surface coverage of the electrode and, by imaging a single bacterium,
calculate the number of surface displayed redox enzymes for the first
time without using biochemical tools. We could study different mutants
and their characteristic ET rate constants as well as redox potentials.
Through multidimensional experimental results, we were able to show
that, when the distance between a mediator and an active enzyme binding
pocket is too large, hardly any mediation occurs. In contrast, when
the distance between the enzymatic active site and the redox mediator
is small (5 Å in this case), mediation of ET occurs that is reflected
in the fast ET as predicted by theory. The surface density by the
autodisplayed enzymes is very close to surface densities reported
for enzymatic electrodes that contained ADH with larger dimensions.19 These results strongly suggest that the enzyme
expression density in our system is relevant for studies using “enzymatic-like”
electrodes. In summary, our combined AFM-electrochemical system can
be used as a platform for single cell analysis of enzyme activity;
such information is critical for efficient design, development, and
study of bioelectronic systems.
