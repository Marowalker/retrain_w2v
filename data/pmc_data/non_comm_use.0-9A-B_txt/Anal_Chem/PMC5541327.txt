To monitor the structural
integrity of therapeutic proteins, hydrogen–deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is increasingly utilized in the
pharmaceutical industry. The successful outcome of HDX-MS analyses
depends on the sample preparation conditions, which involve the rapid
digestion of proteins at 0 °C and pH 2.5. Very few proteases
are able to withstand such harsh conditions, with pepsin being the
best-known exception, even though its activity is also strongly reduced
at 0 °C. Here, we evaluate the usage of a prolyl endopeptidase
from Aspergillus niger (An-PEP) for HDX-MS. What
makes this protease very attractive is that it cleaves preferentially
the hardest to digest amino acid, proline. To our surprise, and in
contrast to previous reports, An-PEP activity was found optimal around
pH 2.5 and could be further enhanced by urea up to 40%. Under typical
HDX-MS conditions and using small amounts of enzyme, An-PEP generated
an equivalent number of peptides as pepsin, as exemplified by using
the two model systems tetrameric human hemoglobin (Hb) and human IgG4.
Interestingly, because An-PEP peptides are shorter than pepsin-generated
peptides, higher sequence resolution could be achieved, especially
for Pro-containing protein regions in the alpha subunit of Hb, revealing
new protected Hb regions that were not observed with pepsin. Due to
its Pro-preference and resistance to low pH, we conclude that An-PEP
is an archetype enzyme for HDX-MS, highly complementary to pepsin,
and especially promising for structural studies on Pro-rich proteins
or proteins containing Pro-rich binding domains involved in cellular
signaling.

==== Body
Biological
processes are governed
by the function of proteins and their noncovalent interactions with
ligands, which can range from small molecules (metabolites and cofactors)
to nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and other proteins. With the advent
of electrospray ionization,1 several mass
spectrometry (MS)-based methods have been developed to investigate
protein assemblies and their interactions.2 These entail chemical surface labeling techniques such as hydrogen–deuterium
exchange MS (HDX-MS), cross-linking MS, limited proteolysis MS, and
also direct mass analysis of intact proteins and protein complexes,
the latter (re)defined as native mass spectrometry.3 HDX-MS is based on the principle that protein amide groups
constantly exchange hydrogens from water in solution. For HDX-MS,
hydrogens in proteins can be typically divided into three groups:
(i) hydrogens in thiol, amino, and carboxyl groups in amino acid side
chains that exchange too fast to be monitored, (ii) aliphatic hydrogens
that do no exchange at all, while (iii) amide hydrogens in the peptide
backbone exchange with specific and measurable rates.4 When a hydrogen is replaced by a deuterium, which has a
higher mass, the measured mass differences can reveal solvent-exposed
protein regions or regions that remain unaffected because they are
buried within the protein structure. As protein–ligand interactions
modify the exchange rates of amide protons, these measurements can
provide information about protein structure and dynamics; therefore,
HDX-MS has been used for the study of membrane protein interactions,5−7 antibodies,8 and even protein assemblies9 and viruses.10,11

As HDX-MS
follows primarily a peptic-centric (i.e., bottom-up)
approach, it employs proteases for the generation of peptides prior
to MS analysis. To minimize the exchange of the deuterium-labeled
protein surface back to hydrogen, digestion needs to take place at
low pH and temperature, typically 2.5 and at 0 °C, respectively.12 For this reason and because of its broad specificity,
pepsin is commonly used in HDX-MS even though alternative proteases
have been used. These include the protease type XIII from Aspergillus saitoi, protease type XVIII from Rhizhopus species,13−15 and the plant Nepenthes gracilis proteases nepenthesin I16 and II.17 Like pepsin, all of these proteases are not
specific to one amino acid but can cleave at multiple residues. Under
typical HDX-MS conditions, pepsin cleaves mostly after Met, Leu, and
Phe, while protease type XIII and XVIII additionally cleave at the
positively charged His, Lys, and Arg. The nepenthesins have an even
broader specificity. To improve the digestion efficiency in HDX workflows
and allow for complete sequence coverage with many overlapping peptides
and no autolysis products, proteases have been immobilized on chromatography
resins and often used in tandem. Such efforts have led to better results
with more peptides and higher sequence resolution.14,18,19

The efficiency of a protease to generate
peptides spanning the
whole protein sequence depends strongly on the presence of suitable
cleavage sites equally distributed alongside the protein sequence.
This ensures the digestion of medium-sized peptides with good ionization
properties required for ESI. Pepsin does not process disordered protein
regions adequately because these have limited hydrophobic residues
(e.g., Met, Leu, and Phe) and often contain many Pro or charged amino
acids.20 To overcome this, Ray et al.16 employed nepenthesin I and performed the HDX
analysis of the protein XRCC4. Even though cleavage at Pro was not
particularly pronounced, nepenthesin I achieved a superior coverage
of the disordered region compared to pepsin for this protein. Here,
we characterize the performance of a genuine Pro-specific peptidase
from Aspergillus niger the Prolyl endopeptidase (An-PEP)21,22 in HDX-MS applications. Currently, due to its Pro preference, An-PEP
is used in tests for the alleviation of celiac disease symptoms.23−25 An-PEP is an acidic protease that displays high thermostability
and in addition to its preference for Pro, Ala and other amino acids
are also cleaved albeit to a lesser extend.21,26 Here, activity-based profiling using an intact fluorescent protein
revealed that An-PEP has a pH optimum near 2 and that low concentration
of urea boosts proteolytic activity by 40% at 0 °C. We demonstrate
that, during HDX analysis of the hemoglobin tetramer and IgG4 (using
a mutant lacking the hinge region), An-PEP generated a number of peptides
comparable to that of pepsin albeit with very distinct and shorter
sequences. The complementarity of the two enzymes was apparent in
the generated sequence maps showing that different regions of the
proteins were sequenced with variable resolution in each digest. Our
results on the solvent exposure of the studied proteins agree with
published crystallographic data but also extend our knowledge for
regions that could not have been previously sequenced in detail using
pepsin alone. Due to its Pro-preference and resistance to low pH,
we conclude that An-PEP is a suitable enzyme for HDX-MS, highly complementary
to pepsin, and especially promising for structural studies on Pro-rich
proteins (PRPs) or proteins containing Pro-rich binding domains involved
in cellular signaling.

Experimental Section
Proteins
Human
hemoglobin and porcine pepsin were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. AN-PEP was
provided by after purification from A. niger using
ion-exchange chromatography with a 10 mm MonoQ column (GE Healthcare)
according to the protocol provided by the vendor DSM. IgG4Δhinge
mutant was a gift from Genmab (Utrecht, The Netherlands), which has
been described in detail previously.27

Activity Assays
Activity of An-PEP was measured using
the fluorescence protease assay kit (Pierce-Thermo Scientific) and
because An-PEP is an acidic protease, we used the Twining method.28 A detailed description of this procedure is
included as Supporting Information.

HDX-MS
Analysis
A detailed description of this analysis
is included as Supporting Information.
In short, An-PEP solution was prepared in 50 mM citric acid pH 2.5
and pepsin in 0.1% formic acid pH 2.5. IgG4Δhinge27 and human Hb were prepared in phosphate-buffered
saline buffer pH 7.4. Sixty picomoles of Hb or IgG4Δhinge were
diluted 30-fold to either D2O (a 99.9% pure solution of
D2O, pD 7.4) for the deuterated samples or water pH 7 for
the nondeuterated controls. Deuteration proceeded at room temperature
(RT) for different time points, and the reaction was quenched by 1:1
dilution into an ice-cold solution of 4 M urea and 200 mM TCEP at
a final pH of 2.5. An-PEP was kept at RT for 10 min to equilibrate
and immediately after quenching of the H/D exchange, digestion was
performed with either An-PEP or pepsin in solution at a 1:1 molar
ratio (1 uM final concentration) in the quench conditions for 3 min
at 0 °C. Peptide mixtures were then immediately injected into
a nano-Acquity UPLC system with HDX technology coupled to a Waters
Xevo QTof G2 instrument, and each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
Peptides were sequenced using MSE data acquisition and
identified with ProteinLynx Global Server 2.5 software at 1% false
discovery rate (FDR). Uptake of deuterium for each peptide was calculated
compared to the nondeuterated control samples using Waters DynamX
3.0.0 software.

Results and Discussion
Proline residues
in proteins are particularly difficult to digest
by most proteases because of their cyclic nature. However, different
Pro-targeting enzymes do exist. Pro aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases
can remove Pro residues from the protein termini.29 Depending on the size of the containing amino acid chain,
Pro can also be processed in shorter substrates by oligopeptidases
and finally in large proteinaceous substrates by a specific class
of endoproteases (PEP).30 These proteases
are divided into different classes, including serine and metalloproteases.
PEPs are characterized by a wide range of properties with respect
to temperature and ionic strength, demonstrating a pH profile with
a characteristic double sigmoidal curve that peaks at pH 6 and 8.31 In contrast, the PEP from A. niger, used here, displays an acidic pH optimum (pH 4–5) and it
is therefore particularly interesting for HDX-MS applications.

An-PEP Activity
Protease activities are commonly detected
using short fluorescent synthetic peptides. The same approach is also
used for measuring in vitro the activity of recombinant proteases.
However, the successful outcome of such tests depends on the degree
of protease specificity toward the amino acid that is coupled to the
fluorophore. Besides Pro, An-PEP is known to also cleave Ala and also
other amino acids, albeit with lower efficiency.21,26 Therefore, we reasoned that the use of a full protein, in this case
FTC-casein, would be a much more suitable probe for An-PEP activity
than Pro-ending peptides. To our surprise and in contrast to previous
reports using Pro-ending peptides,21,26 we observed
that An-PEP activity shows two optima at pH ∼2 and ∼6.
This pattern of double pH optima has been previously reported also
for neutral PEPs31 but not for an acidic
PEP. The highest substrate hydrolysis occurred at pH 2, and a 60%
lower activity was observed at pH 6 (Figure 1A). The same profile was also observed at
0 °C, even though the enzymatic activity was reduced compared
to that at pH 2 at RT. To prime the PEP activity and achieve a better
proteolytic digestion at low temperature, we kept An-PEP at RT for
10 min to equilibrate prior to addition to the casein substrate. Compared
to 0 °C, An-PEP pre-equilibration enhanced digestion by more
than 20% and reached a final activity level of 40% at pH 2 compared
to that at RT (Figure 1A).

(panel A). Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean
of triplicate measurements. Activity is expressed as relative fluorescence
units at 30 °C and absorbance at 480 nm after correction for
background fluorescence.

Protein digestion prior to HDX-MS is done under mild denaturing
and reducing conditions, very shortly at 0 °C and typically at
pH ∼2.5. Under these conditions, the back-exchange of deuterium
to hydrogen is minimized,12 but also, most
proteolytic enzymes become inactive. This is the main reason why only
a few acidic proteases have been used to date in HDX-MS experiments.
Notably pepsin, even though it works best at 37 °C, remains active
enough at 0 °C to digest proteins within a few minutes and is
thus commonly used in HDX-MS. An-PEP is an interesting protease for
HDX-MS because it has a cleavage preference very different than that
of pepsin and, in this respect, the two enzymes could be very complementary.
Seeing that An-PEP remains sufficiently active at low temperature
and acidic conditions, we implemented more HDX-MS experimental settings
in our tests and analyzed An-PEP activity levels at increasing concentrations
of urea or TCEP at 0 °C and acidic pH (2.5). As before, An-PEP
was pre-equilibrated at RT. Interestingly, we found that at these
conditions, urea (until 3 M) enhances the previously seen optimal
An-PEP activity at pH 2 by approximately 20–40% (Figure 1B), probably due to the unfolding
of the substrate. In fact, at custom HDX-MS conditions such as 0 °C,
pH ∼2, and 2 M urea, the enhancing effect of urea was about
40%. TCEP had an overall inhibitory effect on An-PEP (Figure 1C) and at HDX-MS conditions
(100 mM TCEP), An-PEP activity reached 50%. Collectively, our observations
showed that, under these conditions, An-PEP remains at least 50% active
and thus very efficient for protein digestion in the typical HDX-MS
workflow.

An-PEP Performance during HDX-MS
Biopharmaceuticals
(i.e., protein or nucleic acid-based pharmaceutical substances, which
are produced by means other than direct extraction from a native biological
source) require high structural consistency during development. To
monitor the structural integrity of therapeutic proteins, HDX-MS has
gained popularity within the pharmaceutical industry. The advantages
of this method include high sensitivity for conformational changes,
relatively low sample amount, no protein size restrictions, and completion
of the analysis within days. Currently, pepsin is commonly used in
the HDX-MS pipeline, but digestion does not always lead to complete
protein coverage; thus, alternative proteases may be beneficial.

To investigate the utility of An-PEP for HDX-MS, we used two model
systems that range in size and Mw from
290 to 1304 residues or from 64 (tetrameric hemoglobin) to 146 kDa
(dimeric assembly of IgG4) and benchmarked the performance of An-PEP
against pepsin. The engineered 146 kDa antibody was a variant of IgG4,
earlier used in native MS studies27 in
which the hinge region had been removed (IgG4Δhinge), allowing
for the occurrence of mono- and dimeric IgG4 molecules.27 After LC–MS/MS, the resulting mixture
of deuterated peptides (Supplementary Table 1) was used to analyze enzyme specificity and the solution-phase properties
of the protein samples and to compare the performance of the two enzymes.

Even though the number of identified deuterated peptides differed
slightly for both proteins, the sequence coverage that was achieved
with An-PEP compared well with pepsin and was higher than 90% for
both hemoglobin (Hb) and IgG4Δhinge (Table 1). In fact, An-PEP generated more Hb peptides,
while pepsin generated more IgG4Δhinge peptides. Even though
these results did not affect sequence coverage, variable amino acid
redundancy values (i.e., times that a given amino acid is mapped by
different peptides) were observed between digests, which indicates
that certain protein regions were digested more efficiently by one
protease than the other. As such, An-PEP sequenced deeper the α
subunit of Hb, while pepsin performed better for the light chain of
the IgG4Δhinge molecule, which demonstrates that the results
obtained with these proteases are highly complementary. Consequently,
the overlap in peptide identifications within the different protein
digests was less than 12% (Supplementary Figure 1A), and the An-PEP-generated peptides were on average shorter
than pepsin-generated peptides (Supplementary Figure 1B), which is a feature that in principle may increase
sequence resolution during HDX-MS. In summary, An-Pep performed similar
or even better than pepsin under the used experimental conditions
using low amounts of enzyme and represents a valuable alternative
to pepsin for HDX-MS. Furthermore, our results endorse that also in
HDX-MS analysis the use of multiple proteases can lead to superior
results, as is well-known for bottom-up (phospho)proteomics.32−34

An-PEP Specificity
The specificity
of An-PEP has been
previously evaluated at pH 4–5 and, unlike pepsin, An-PEP preferentially
cleaves C-terminal to Pro residues. In addition, cleavage at Ala and
other amino acids is also observed.21,26 Here, we evaluated
the An-PEP specificity at pH 2.5, i.e., under optimal HDX-MS conditions,
and we confirm that also at this pH, An-PEP cleaves preferentially
C-terminal to Pro (Figures 2A and B). In fact, more than 50% of prolines in the tested
proteins were cleaved by An-PEP.

Figure 2 Amino acid frequency at cleavage position
P1(Schechter and Berger
nomenclature35) in An-PEP and pepsin digestions
of (A) hemoglobin and (B) IgG4Δhinge during HDX-MS analysis.
Cleavage percentage was calculated relative to the frequency of each
amino acid in the respective protein.

On the contrary, such events were very rare (Figure 2B) or even absent (Figure 2A) in the digests
of pepsin. Other amino
acids, including Ala, were also cleaved by An-PEP, but in all such
cases, cleavage was lower than 20%. In our data set, pepsin cleaved
primarily at Phe, Leu, and Met by more than 30% in addition to other
amino acids. Compared to the strong An-PEP preference for Pro (>50%),
pepsin is found to be a less specific protease than An-PEP at pH 2.5.

Although HDX-MS is a peptic-centric mass spectrometry-based method,
it is not ideal for the analysis of hundreds of proteins and thousands
of resulting peptides within a single LC–MS run and is therefore
not suited for the detailed analysis of protease specificity. For
this, we performed the digestion of the Escherichia coli proteome at pH 2.5 and analyzed the peptides with bottom-up proteomics
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). As with
the two HDX-MS test cases, E. coli proteins were
also cleaved predominantly at Pro (Supplementary Figures 2A and B). Ala was more frequently cleaved in the bottom-up
than in the HDX-MS setup probably because during the first, the digestion
was performed longer to overcome the higher sample complexity. Overall,
we did not observe any major determinants of An-PEP specificity besides
Pro or Ala at position P1. For Pro-cleaved peptides, no other sequence
determinants were observed and, interestingly, Pro was never found
at P1′ (Supplementary Figure 2C).
Also in Ala-cleaved peptides, Pro at P1′ was not favorable
for cleavage (Supplementary Figure 2D).
For both Pro and Ala-cleaved peptides, a relative preference for acidic
residues was seen at P1′, while the basic Lys is somewhat frequent
at the nonprime side of Ala-cleaved peptides (Supplementary Figure 2D). These results are in agreement with
recent reports.36

Next, after inspection
of peptides containing a missed cleavage
site (Supplementary Figure 3), we observed
that Pro-missed sites were 8 times fewer than Ala-missed sites, which
shows that Pro is more efficiently cleaved than Ala. Considering the
sequence context in Pro and Ala-missed cleavages, we observed that
all basic residues (Arg, Lys, and His) at P2′ have a negative
effect on An-PEP cleavage efficiency. Also, even though we would assume
that Pro would be present at position P1′ in the missed cleavage
iceLogos, we were not able to see this information because the used
software takes into account only the natural abundance of amino acids
in individual protein positions and does not consider the frequency
of Pro-Pro or Ala-Pro motifs in the proteome.37

Structural Analysis of Human Hemoglobin by HDX-MS
Human
hemoglobin (Hb) is a globular tetramer consisting of two heterodimers
of α and β subunits (αβ). The α and
β subunits consist of seven to eight α-helices (A–H),
respectively (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4). Each of
the four Hb subunits contains a heme group where oxygen can bind and
therefore Hb is the oxygen carrier protein in red blood cells. Besides
its biological role, Hb is routinely used as a model system for intact
protein analysis with MS. Here, we analyzed D2O uptake
in Hb after digestion with either An-PEP or pepsin (Supplementary Table 1) to assess solvent accessibility and
compared the results obtained by using the two proteases. Overall,
the solution-phase properties of Hb were found to be similar using
either An-PEP or pepsin and in agreement with previously published
HDX-MS38 and crystallographic data39 for bovine Hb (Figure 3). In fact, segments in helices αG
and βG showed significant protection as these elements are deeply
buried to form anchoring points at the hydrophobic intersubunit interface.38,39 On the contrary, the C-terminus of the α subunit and the N-terminus
of the β subunit are the most solvent-accessible regions of
the protein (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4). Despite
the similarities in the overall D2O uptake between the
two digests, a few differences were observed. Those included the N-terminus
of the α subunit (region I), helix αH (region II), helix
βC (region III), and helix βF−βG (region
IV) (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4). Because An-PEP and pepsin
generated very distinct peptides in terms of sequence and length (Supplementary Figure 1), protein segments were
mapped with overlapping peptides of variable length in each of these
digests. For the Hb regions I and II, An-PEP generated peptides smaller
than those of pepsin, enabling better sequence resolution of the corresponding
segment. This revealed short protected sequence segments that in pepsin
maps were masked by the overall high deuterium uptake of long peptides.
Consequently, the superior sequence resolution that was here achieved
with An-PEP for the N-terminal segment of the αA helix (area
I) and its overlaying segment of aH helix (area II) has not been previously
reported with pepsin-based HDX data38 and
revealed another solvent-protected region of Hb. On the other hand,
at the β subunit in regions III and IV, An-PEP did not generate
sufficient peptides, probably because there are not many prolines
present in this region to create peptides of suitable length. Thus,
pepsin-based data allowed for a better, yet again not optimal, view
of this subunit with a few more peptides than An-PEP (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4). Overall, the combined analysis of Hb using An-PEP
and pepsin confirmed the known features of the Hb quaternary structure.
Furthermore, due to its Pro preference, An-PEP also allowed a more
in depth investigation of the solution-phase properties of Hb regions
where prolines are found (region II). For this model system we conclude
that the performance of An-PEP for HDX-MS is at least on par with
pepsin, offering additionally deeper sequencing of Pro-containing
regions.

Structural analysis of
IgG4Δhinge by HDX-MS
Human
immunoglobulin G (IgG) is a protein of 146 kDa that consists of two
heavy (H) and two light (L) chains interlinked via a flexible hinge
region. The complete molecule consists of the Fab and the Fc regions
(Figure 4A). Antigens
are bound to the Fab region of IgG, which is formed by a piece of
the H chain linked to the full L chain. In each of the H and L chains
in the Fab region, there is a variable (VL or VH) and a constant domain
(CL or CH1). The Fc region consists of the CH2 and CH3 domains of
the H chain and mediates the interaction of IgG with proteins and
receptors on the cell surface.

the protein regions that are discussed in detail in the text are named
only in the pepsin map. The here presented IgG4Δhinge structure
was modeled based on the available Pembrolizumab structure43 (PDB: 5DK3).

In this study, we focused
on IgG4, a subclass of human antibodies
that can be functionally monovalent in vivo40 and therefore can dynamically exchange half molecules (heavy–light
chain pair) in a mechanism called Fab-arm exchange (FAE).41 To date, there is only one complete crystal
structure available for a IgG443 and, due
to the limitation of crystallographic data in predicting adequately
the properties of a protein in solution, we set out to investigate
IgG4 properties with HDX-MS. The analyzed IgG4 antibody was depleted
of the hinge region (IgG4Δhinge), and this prevented the interheavy
chain disulfide bond formation and dimerization, allowing for a dynamic
equilibrium of mono- and dimeric molecules.27

Deuterium uptake data (Supplementary Table 1) were mapped onto a structural model of IgG4Δhinge
that we modeled based upon the structure of the IgG4 Pembrolizumab.43 In contrast to IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, crystallographic
data have shown that the IgG4 molecule is very compact and has an
affinity for Fc receptors and complement C1q overall lower than those
of IgG1 and IgG3.43−46 Interactions with Fc receptors at the FG loop (for IgG4Δhinge:
Lys318-Ile324) and the CH2 loop (for IgG4Δhinge: Pro236-Pro249)
take place at the solvent-exposed regions of CH2 domain closely located
to the hinge region (Figures 4B and C). Another exposed site where the glycan attaches to
the CH3 domain is at Asn383. Accordingly, in both An-PEP and pepsin
HDX-MS uptake maps for IgG4Δhinge, our data indicated the same
solvent-exposed regions as seen in crystallographic data of Pembrolizumab
(Figures 4B and C and Supplementary Figure 5). Again, as seen in the
HDX-MS analysis of Hb (Figure 3), the uptake data derived from the two digests are in close
agreement, and the observed differences are due to differences in
peptide length. An-PEP allowed for a complete coverage of the CH2
loop and led to higher sequence resolution in the CH2–CH3 interdomain
loop, while pepsin generated smaller overlapping peptides in the CH3
strand and helix (Leu344–Asn354) following the CH2–CH3
interdomain loop. Pepsin-generated peptides also revealed the exposure
of the loop bearing Asn383, where a glycan is attached in Pembrolizumab
and confirmed the crystallographic data. Furthermore, our An-PEP data
revealed another exposed region in the VL domain of the light chain.
From our HDX-MS data on Hb and IgG4Δhinge, we conclude that
the structural properties of both analyzed proteins were in close
agreement in each digestion and with the previously reported crystallographic
data. An-PEP and pepsin generated peptides of different sequence and
length and mapped protein regions with distinct resolution (Supplementary Figure 4 and 5). Also, protein
segments that were not sequenced with one protease were identified
with the other (Supplementary Figure 6).
Combination of the sequence information derived with each protease
led to higher sequence coverage for both analyzed proteins.

Conclusions
Here, we investigated the properties of the Prolyl endopeptidase
from A. niger, An-PEP, with respect to HDX-MS and
showed that An-PEP can digest proteins very efficiently, within a
few minutes, at the optimal pH (2.5) and temperature (0 °C) required.
Using two human proteins (Hb and IgG4Δhinge) as model systems,
we showed that HDX-MS is a powerful technique to study protein structures
with an emphasis on solvent accessibility. The An-PEP genuine preference
for cleavage after Pro residues makes this protease very distinct
from pepsin and allows for a superior view of Pro-containing protein
regions. Such regions are for instance present in intrinsically unstructured
proteins20,47 but also in so-called Pro-rich motifs that
are recognized by other protein domains involved in signaling pathways,
including the SH3, phosphotyrosine-binding, and WW domains.48 The here acquired deuterium uptake data were
in good agreement with previous structural data on Hb and IgG4 structures
obtained by crystallography. In particular, the An-PEP derived exchange
data allowed a more in-depth investigation of the solution-phase properties
of Hb regions where Pro residues are included. For this reason, the
combined use of An-PEP and pepsin in HDX-MS may offer an enhanced
and more detailed view of protein structures.

Additionally,
the calculation of deuterium uptake in HDX workflows
could become simpler with the use of prolyl-specific proteases. As
deuterium incorporation is not possible at Pro due to its lack of
a backbone amide hydrogen, peptides that carry an N-terminal Pro do
not suffer from N-terminal back exchange to hydrogen, which is very
fast and therefore needs to be deducted from the overall peptide uptake
during the calculation. In this respect, a protease that cleaves N-terminally
to Pro and generates Pro-starting peptides would simplify uptake calculation
in HDX-MS analyses, but to our knowledge, no such protease has been
identified yet. Another acidic Pro-specific protease, Neprosin,49 from the Nepenthes plant genus,
has been recently used for proteomics and histone mapping.36

However, this protease has an optimum
temperature of 37–50
°C, which probably restricts it from usage in HDX-MS applications.
Here, we conclude that, due to its optimal activity at pH ∼2.5,
which can be even further enhanced by adding 1–2 M urea, An-PEP
represents a novel protease with ideal opportunities for HDX-MS investigations,
providing structural insights that are complementary to pepsin digestion.
In our initial experiments, we already showed that An-PEP performs
on par with pepsin regarding equivalent number of peptides when used
on relatively large protein structures such as the tetrameric human
hemoglobin and the dimeric IgG4. Further optimization such as on column
enzyme-immobilization and optimized fragmentation schemes for An-PEP
peptides using electron-transfer dissociation, electron-transfer and
higher-energy collision dissociation, or ultraviolet photodissociation
fragmentation may make An-PEP the protease of choice for future HDX-MS
experiments. Especially, protein regions rich in Pro residues such
as those frequently present in intrinsically disordered proteins and
binding domains involved in signaling may represent ideal systems
to investigate by An-PEP and HDX-MS.
