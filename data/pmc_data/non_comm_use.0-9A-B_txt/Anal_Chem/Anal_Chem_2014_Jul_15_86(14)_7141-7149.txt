The in vivo analytical performance
of percutaneously implanted
nitric oxide (NO)-releasing amperometric glucose biosensors was evaluated
in swine for 10 d. Needle-type glucose biosensors were functionalized
with NO-releasing polyurethane coatings designed to release similar
total amounts of NO (3.1 μmol cm–2) for rapid
(16.0 ± 4.4 h) or slower (>74.6 ± 16.6 h) durations and
remain functional as outer glucose sensor membranes. Relative to controls,
NO-releasing sensors were characterized with improved numerical accuracy
on days 1 and 3. Furthermore, the clinical accuracy and sensitivity
of rapid NO-releasing sensors were superior to control and slower
NO-releasing sensors at both 1 and 3 d implantation. In contrast,
the slower, extended, NO-releasing sensors were characterized by shorter
sensor lag times (<4.2 min) in response to intravenous glucose
tolerance tests versus burst NO-releasing and control sensors (>5.8
min) at 3, 7, and 10 d. Collectively, these results highlight the
potential for NO release to enhance the analytical utility of in vivo
glucose biosensors. Initial results also suggest that this analytical
performance benefit is dependent on the NO-release duration.

==== Body
Despite the
obvious benefits
of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for the management of diabetes,
the utility of in vivo amperometric glucose biosensors is limited
to <1 week due to poor analytical performance, resulting primarily
from the foreign body response (FBR).1,2 Insertion of
the sensor damages vascularized tissue and results in a cascade of
inflammatory events, many of which negatively impact glucose measurements.3 For example, the resulting passive adsorption
of biomolecules (mainly <15 kDa protein fragments) to the sensor
surface initiates an inflammatory response and is responsible for
a dramatic decrease in sensor sensitivity (∼50%) following
sensor implantation.3−6 Increased metabolic activity of inflammatory cells (i.e., macrophages
and foreign body giant cells) at the sensor–tissue interface
results in inordinate consumption of glucose and oxygen, decreasing
their local concentrations and attenuating sensor performance.7 The hallmark of the FBR is the formation of a
thick, avascular collagen capsule surrounding the sensor, isolating
it from the tissue and obstructing mass transport of interstitial
glucose to the sensor.3 Indeed, the FBR
increases sensor response time, decreases sensitivity, and often results
in device failure.

Efforts to improve the analytical performance
of in vivo biosensors
have largely focused on chemical or physical modifications to the
outermost, tissue-contacting membrane to mitigate the FBR.8 Examples of such strategies include biomimicry
(e.g., the attachment of phospholipids to coating surfaces),9 employing naturally derived materials as coatings,10 utilizing membranes that reduce cell adhesion,11 encouraging tissue ingrowth into porous coatings,12−14 and modulating cell behavior through coating topography.15 The active release of anti-inflammatory or pro-angiogenic
bioactive agents such as dexamethasone (DX) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) has also been proposed as a viable option for
improving glucose sensor function.16,17 However, in
addition to the immune suppression associated with DX18 and pro-inflammatory roles of VEGF,19 the controlled release of these molecules from sensor coatings
remains a major hurdle.

The controlled release of nitric oxide
(NO), an endogenous molecule
with multiple roles in inflammation, wound healing, and angiogenesis,
from polymeric coatings has been shown to minimize the FBR.1,20−22 Hetrick et al. examined the FBR to subcutaneously
implanted NO-releasing xerogels coated on silicone elastomers in a
murine model.23 Nitric oxide-releasing
implants, which generated ∼1.35 μmol cm–2 NO over 72 h at fluxes >1 pmol cm–2 s–1, elicited only a mild FBR with reduced fibrous encapsulation (>25%)
after 3 and 6 weeks compared to tissue near control implants. Concomitant
with a reduced FBR, blood vessel density in the tissue surrounding
the NO-releasing implants was greater (∼50%) than that observed
surrounding control implants. Nichols et al. assessed glucose recovery
as a function of NO release using percutaneously implanted microdialysis
probes.24 A constant NO flux (162 pmol
cm–2 s–1, 4.6 μmol cm–2 NO daily) was achieved from microdialysis probes
by using a saturated NO solution as the perfusate. While the glucose
recovery of control probes was severely diminished beyond 7 d, NO-releasing
microdialysis probes exhibited near constant glucose recovery throughout
the study. These results were correlated to tissue histology observations.
Indeed, histological analysis of the tissue surrounding NO-releasing
probes at 14 d revealed lower inflammatory cell counts and a thinner
collagen capsule versus probes that did not release NO. The lessened
FBR and increased glucose recovery suggest that NO release lowered
tissue impedance to glucose transport. In a separate study, Nichols
and co-workers investigated the effects of NO-release kinetics on
the FBR to subcutaneous NO-releasing wire implants (i.e., mock glucose
sensors) in a porcine model.25 Decreased
collagen capsule thickness (>50%) was observed for substrates that
released NO for extended durations (i.e., >14 d) versus wires that
did not release NO. In contrast, substrates with shorter NO-release
durations (12–24 h) were characterized by greater collagen
density at the implant–tissue interface compared to the materials
which released NO for extended durations. Collectively, this body
of work highlights the dramatic effect of NO-release kinetics on the
FBR and the potential to impact the analytical performance of in vivo
glucose biosensors.

Despite extensive characterization of the
host response to NO-releasing
implants, the interplay between reduced FBR and actual sensor performance
remains a critical void. To date, only one study has evaluated the
in vivo performance of a NO-releasing glucose sensor. Gifford et al.
reported improved clinical accuracy for NO-releasing needle-type glucose
biosensors implanted in rats for 3 d.26 However, the NO release from the sensors was limited to 16 h and
deterioration of sensor performance by day 3 was observed.27 Histological analysis of the surrounding tissues
revealed suppressed inflammation at NO-releasing sensors on day 1
versus controls, but no benefits following depletion of the NO reservoir.
Clearly, the role of NO release on sensor analytical performance should
be studied in greater detail.

As the severity of the FBR to
NO-releasing implants is dependent
on release kinetics, we sought to investigate these effects on the
performance of percutaneously implanted glucose biosensors. Given
previous findings, it is hypothesized that by extending NO-release
duration, sensor merits (i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, response time)
may be maintained for longer implantation periods (>7 d). Herein,
we report on the analytical performance of NO-releasing needle-type
glucose biosensors in swine as a function of NO-release duration.

acid (DTPA) and sodium methoxide (5.4 M in methanol) were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol (EtOH),
aqueous ammonium hydroxide (30 wt %), and all salts were purchased
from Fisher Scientific (St. Louis, MO), Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS),
(3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS), and (3-methylaminopropyl)trimethoxysilane
(MAP3) were purchased from Gelest (Tullytown, PA). Methyltrimethoxysilane
(MTMOS) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) was purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium).
Hydrothane (AL25-80A) polyurethane (HPU) was a gift from AdvanSource
Biomaterials (Wilmington, MA). Tecoflex (SG-85A) polyurethane (TPU)
was a gift from Lubrizol (Cleveland, OH). Steel wire (356 μm
diam) was purchased from McMaster-Carr (Atlanta, GA). Argon, nitrogen,
oxygen, and nitric oxide calibration gas (25.87 ppm in nitrogen) were
purchased from Airgas National Welders (Raleigh, NC). Nitric oxide
gas was purchased from Praxair (Danbury, CT). Water was purified using
a Millipore Milli-Q UV gradient A10 system (Bedford, MA) to a resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ·cm and a total organic content of ≤6
ppb. All other chemicals were reagent grade and used as received.

Synthesis of NO-Releasing Silica Nanoparticles
Synthesis
of NO-releasing silica nanoparticles was carried out as described
previously.28 Briefly, MPTMS particles
were synthesized via the co-condensation of MPTMS (70 mol %) and TEOS.
The thiol-containing nanoparticles were nitrosated by reaction with
acidified nitrite in the dark at 0 °C for 2 h. Mesoporous MAP3
silica nanoparticles were prepared via the surfactant-templated co-condensation
of TEOS in the presence of CTAB, followed by removal of CTAB and surface-grafting
of MAP3 to the particle surface. Subsequent N-diazeniumdiolation
of the secondary amine-containing nanoparticles was carried out under
high pressures of NO (10 atm) at room temperature for 3 d in the presence
of sodium methoxide. Sizes and total NO-release payloads of the silica
nanoparticles are included in the Supporting Information [SI] (Table S2).

Preparation of NO-Releasing Mock Sensors
Steel wire
was cut in 7 cm pieces and cleaned by sonication in EtOH for 10 min.
Polymer solutions containing the macromolecular NO-release scaffolds
were prepared by dispersing MAP3 or MPTMS particles (72 and 48 mg
mL–1, respectively) in an 80 mg mL–1 solution of 50:50 wt % HPU/TPU in 1:1 EtOH/THF. Wire substrates
were modified by dip coating (5 mm s–1 with a 5-s
hold time) four times into the particle-containing PU solution using
a DipMaster 50 dip coater (Chemat Technology, Inc.; Northridge, CA)
with 30 min drying periods under ambient conditions between dips.
A final TPU topcoat was applied by dip coating into a 40 mg mL–1 TPU solution in THF.

Characterization of NO-Releasing
Wire Substrates
Nitric
oxide release from steel wire substrates was measured in real time
using a Sievers 280i chemiluminescence NO analyzer (NOA; Boulder,
CO). Generation of NO from PU films was detected indirectly by the
formation of a chemiluminescent product (NO2*) upon reaction
of NO with ozone. The NOA was calibrated using an atmospheric gas
sample passed through a Sievers NO zero filter (0 ppb) and 25.9 ppm
of NO in N2. Substrates were immersed in deoxygenated phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 M, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The liberated
NO from PU films was carried to the NOA by a stream of N2, bubbled into solution at a volumetric flow rate of 75 mL min–1. For films containing S-nitrosothiol
NO donors (i.e., MPTMS particles), the sample flask was shielded from
light, and 500 μM DTPA was added to the PBS buffer to chelate
trace copper. Data output from the NOA was collected every 1 s, allowing
for near real-time monitoring of NO generated from the films.

The stability of silica particles in PU films was assessed using
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).
Modified wire substrates were immersed in PBS buffer and incubated
at 37 °C for 10 d. The degree of particle leaching into soak
solutions was determined by monitoring the silicon emission intensity
at 251.611 nm using a Prodigy high dispersion ICP (Teledyne Leeman
Laboratories; Hudson, NH).

Fabrication and Benchtop Performance of NO-Releasing
Needle-Type
Glucose Sensors
Bare needle-type glucose sensors (Pinnacle
Technology, Inc., Lawrence, KS), composed of an integrated silver/silver
chloride (Ag/AgCl) pseudoreference electrode wound around a 90:10
platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) working electrode (127 μm diam, ∼1
mm length), were functionalized by the successive deposition of a
polyphenol selectivity layer, a GOx enzyme layer, a NO-releasing flux-limiting
membrane, and a polyurethane topcoat, as described previously.29−31 Experimental details regarding biosensor sterilization, functionalization,
and benchtop testing are provided in the SI. Following deposition of the selectivity and enzyme layers, sensors
were coated with a PU diffusion-limiting/NO-releasing layer by dip-coating
into a particle-containing PU solution. A TPU topcoat was then applied
as an additional layer. Control sensors were coated using PU solutions
containing MAP3 or MPTMS nanoparticles (72 and 48 mg mL–1, respectively) that were not functionalized with N-diazeniumdiolate or S-nitrosothiol NO donors.

In Vivo Protocol for Assessing Biosensor Analytical Performance
The animal protocol used in this study was approved by the IACUC
at Synchrony, LLC (Durham, NC). The in vivo performance of glucose
biosensors was evaluated in Yorkshire-type piglets (n = 10; Palmetto Research Swine; Reevesville, SC) weighing approximately
7–15 kg. Details regarding sensor implantation and operation
are provided in the SI. Biosensor performance
was evaluated on 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 d after sensor implantation. A
peripherally inserted central catheter was placed in an external jugular
vein for blood draws. Reference blood glucose (BG) concentrations
were measured every 10 min for 6–8 h using a One Touch Ultra
glucometer (LifeScan, Inc.; Milpitas, CA) for comparison to sensor
data. During glucose sensor evaluation, pigs were fasted and sedated
with propofol (2 mg kg–1 h–1)
administered through a catheter in a peripheral ear vein. Once on
the day of implantation and three times daily thereafter, the swine
were challenged with an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT;
0.7 g kg–1, 50 wt % dextrose, 1–1.5 h duration),
administered over 30 s through the peripheral catheter, to assess
the ability of glucose sensors to track changing blood glucose concentrations.
On day 10, pigs were euthanized and the sensors were explanted by
removal of the surrounding tissue en bloc. Postexplantation, sensors
were imaged using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM;
FEI Quanta 200 Field Emission Gun; Hillsboro, OR).

Data Analysis
Sensor current traces were filtered and
analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts (Mathworks, Inc.; Natick, MA).
A finite impulse response (FIR) filter was used to attenuate large
noise spikes caused by pig motion and potentiostat RF transmitter
dropout.32 A 1 min median filter was used
to further smooth the data before pairing sensor current traces with
reference measurements. Glucose sensors were calibrated with respect
to reference BG measurements once per day using a two-point retrospective
calibration.33,34 One point for calibration was
taken at a stable glucose baseline (i.e., prior to the first IVGTT),
while the second point was taken at a stable point after the first
dextrose administration with at least a 15 mg dL–1 difference between BG concentrations. The slope of a linear trend
line connecting these two points was taken as the apparent in vivo
biosensor sensitivity on each day, expressed as mean values ±
standard deviation. The method of Poincaré was used to approximate
the time delay at which the correlation between the reference and
calibrated sensor signals was greatest, using R2 as the agreement criterion.35,36 This delay
was determined at ∼5 min and used to correct sensor data on
each day for the physiological time lag that characterizes mass transfer
of glucose from blood to tissue.37 After
sensor implantation, the “run-in” time (i.e., the time
required for sensors to achieve a stable background current) was estimated
by determining the period over which two consecutive sensor measurements
agreed with their respective reference measurements within 20%.

Sensor performance was determined using numerical and clinical accuracy
metrics. The mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) for a data set
collected by a single sensor (∼25–35 measurements) was
used to characterize sensor numerical accuracy at each time point.38 Sensor MARD was calculated using eq 1, where CGM and BG are the blood glucose values determined
by the sensor and reference glucometer, respectively. 1  

Additionally, the International Standards Organization (ISO) criteria
for glucose monitor performance was used to assess sensor numerical
accuracy by separately calculating the percentage of glucose measurements
determined by sensors that were within (1) ±15 mg dL–1 of the paired reference determination when BG was ≤70 mg
dL–1 and (2) ±20% of the paired reference determination
when BG was >70 mg dL–1.38 Sensor clinical accuracy was determined using Clarke error grid
analysis (EGA) by quantifying the percentage of blood glucose determinations
falling in zones A and B of the error grid.39 Cross-correlation of the reference signals and raw sensor current
traces was used to estimate sensor lag time, with possible lag times
restricted to >100 s.40,41 Values for MARD and
lag time
are expressed as mean values ± standard error of the mean. Differences
in median values for sensor MARD, lag time, and sensitivity between
NO-releasing and control sensors were analyzed using a two-tailed
nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test.42

Results and Discussion
Nitric oxide-releasing polyurethanes
were selected as sensor coatings
for evaluating the effect of NO-release duration on in vivo glucose
biosensor performance. Total NO payloads sufficient for minimizing
inflammation (i.e., >1 μmol cm–2)23 with varied NO-release durations (<1 h to
>14 d) were achieved by tuning the PU properties (i.e., water uptake)
and NO donor type.30 We have shown previously
that sensor response is not negatively affected by NO release from
PU coatings at a working electrode potential of +600 mV vs Ag/AgCl.30 The versatile NO-release kinetics and compatibility
with amperometric glucose sensing make NO-releasing polyurethanes
an ideal platform for assessing the effects of NO release on in vivo
glucose biosensor performance.

In Vitro Characterization of NO-Releasing
Glucose Sensors
Wire substrates, selected to mimic the geometry
and size of a needle-type
glucose sensor, were modified with NO-releasing PU coatings via a
dip-coating procedure. A hydrophobic TPU topcoat was employed to both
minimize any leaching of the macromolecular NO donors and eliminate
the surface roughness introduced by nanoparticle dopants. Undoubtedly,
the physical properties (i.e., roughness) of an implant surface will
affect the FBR.15,43 The stability of the nanoparticle-doped
PU coatings in PBS was investigated over 10 d by analyzing the silicon
content of soak solutions using ICP-OES. While silica is intrinsically
biocompatible and considered nontoxic,23,44 the resulting
changes in coating structure or potential tissue inflammation may
affect the performance of glucose sensors in vivo. For coatings doped
with NO-releasing MPTMS-RSNO particles as well as controls, leaching
of silica particles from the PU matrix was undetectable (<2%).
Slight leaching (10.8 ± 2.9% of the total incorporated silica)
was observed from coatings containing NO-releasing MAP3/NO particles.
Interestingly, the majority of the observed leaching occurred during
the first 4 h, suggesting some instability associated with encapsulating
the charged N-diazeniumdiolate NO donor moieties
within the polyurethane coating (data not shown).

The effect
of NO-release duration on in vivo sensor performance was studied using
two different macromolecular NO release systems: N-diazeniumdiolate NO donors and S-nitrosothiol-modified
silica nanoparticles (MAP3/NO and MPTMS-RSNO, respectively). Briefly, N-diazeniumdiolate NO donors undergo proton-initiated decomposition
in aqueous milieu to generate NO.45 Conversely,
NO release from S-nitrosothiols may be triggered
using light or Cu(I), but S-nitrosothiols also decompose
sluggishly through
thermal mechanisms in vivo.28,46 To simulate in vivo
conditions, NO release from PU films was measured in PBS at 37 °C.
For MPTMS-RSNO coatings, thermal decomposition of the S-nitrosothiol moieties was achieved using a light-shielded sample
flask and the addition of DTPA to chelate trace copper. By appropriate
selection of the nanoparticle dopant concentration (72 and 48 mg mL–1 for MAP3/NO and MPTMS-RSNO particles, respectively)
we attained similar total NO payloads (∼3.1 μmol cm–2) for both coating formulations (Table 1). Of note, NO payloads from these coatings were more than
2 times greater than that from the xerogel coatings utilized by Hetrick
et al. (∼1.35 μmol cm–2) and similar
in magnitude to those employed by Nichols et al. (2.7–9.3 μmol
cm–2)—both of which proved effective at reducing
the FBR to subcutaneous implants.23,25

f Determined at the time at which

Upon immersion in PBS, MAP3/NO films exhibited a large
initial
NO flux ([NO]max = 685.8 ± 11.4 pmol cm–2 s–1) and released 99% of their total NO payload
within ∼16 h, with no additional NO release measurable beyond
24 h. Such duration (16 h) was similar to that reported to improve
glucose sensor accuracy by Gifford and co-workers (12–18 h).26 Similarly, MPTMS-RSNO films showed a large initial
NO flux ([NO]max = 551.4 ± 130.0 pmol cm–2 s–1), with a rapid decrease to ∼14.0 pmol
cm–2 s–1 at 8 h. In contrast to
the MAP3/NO films, MPTMS-RSNO coatings required ∼3.1 d to release
99% of their total NO payload, with NO release (0.5 pmol cm–2 s–1) still measurable at ∼7 d. Even such
low levels of NO are physiologically relevant, as vascular endothelial
cells release NO at 1–7 pmol cm–2 s–1 to prevent platelet activation.27,47 Additionally,
similar NO fluxes (1.5–30 pmol cm–2 s–1) inhibit in vitro bacterial adhesion to surfaces.48,49

As expected, NO release from the outer glucose sensor membrane
did not impact biosensor response. After an initial hydration period
of 3–4 h, the glucose sensitivities of NO-releasing and control
sensors were comparable and remained constant (1.3–2.3 nA mM–1) over 10 d in PBS at 37 °C for all membrane
formulations. In the absence of preconditioning, sensors exhibited
poorer dynamic range and longer response times to changes in glucose
concentration during the first several hours of testing (data not
shown). Both NO-releasing and control sensors exhibited acceptable
response times (<40 s) to an increase in glucose concentration
of 5.6 mM. All sensors responded linearly to glucose between 1–12
mM after preconditioning in PBS. Furthermore, the amperometric selectivity
coefficients for glucose over acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, and urea
were 0.82 ± 0.30, 0.49 ± 0.11, and 0.03 ± 0.01, respectively,
for blank sensors (i.e., sensors that were coated solely with polyurethane).
As expected, selectivity for glucose was sufficient. The analytical
performance merits of the sensors are provided in the SI (Table S1).

In Vivo Biosensor Run-In
Time, Glucose Sensitivity, and Clarke
Error Grid
Following implantation, both NO-releasing and
control biosensors displayed a run-in period (i.e., the time required
to achieve a stable baseline current) during which the sensor response
was erratic (Figure S3 in the SI). While
Gifford et al. reported a reduced run-in time for NO-releasing sensors
versus control sensors in rodents,26 we
observed no significant differences in run-in time between NO-releasing
sensors and controls, with all four sensor configurations requiring
∼3–6 h to achieve a steady background current. The source
of this discrepancy is unclear, but a number of variables (e.g., different
animal model, implant method, and extended sensor hydration time)
may have contributed to this result.

The potential analytical
performance benefits of NO-releasing amperometric glucose biosensors
were evaluated in a healthy swine model. The use of digital noise
filters was required to achieve stable current traces due to swine
motion and intermittent potentiostat RF transmitter dropout. The filtering
algorithms were restricted to those compatible with real-time continuous
glucose monitoring.32 As expected, the
FIR and median filters sufficiently improved signal quality without
introducing an undesirable artificial time delay (>20%) between
sensor
and reference signals. Subsequently, sensors were calibrated by comparison
to corresponding reference blood glucose measurements using a two-point
retrospective calibration. While a one-point calibration (which assumes
a negligible background current) has been suggested to be superior
to the two-point calibration,33,34 the in vivo background
in our study was substantial (6–10 nA) compared to the in vitro
baseline (1–3 nA), necessitating the use of a two-point calibration.
Other researchers have also reported disparities between in vitro
and in vivo sensor baseline currents.50 Despite minimizing the artificial delay caused by filtering, a physiological
lag between the sensor signal and reference BG measurements was still
observed. This delay arises from the slow mass transfer of glucose
from the vasculature to the tissue and ultimately the sensor.35−37 An analysis of sensor performance on day 0 via the method of Poincaré36 indicated a ∼5 min lag between the reference
signal and calibrated sensor signal. This lag time was thus accounted
for in all remaining data sets (days 1, 3, 7, and 10) by shifting
the reference signal in time relative to the sensor signal.

The clinical accuracies of NO-releasing and control in vivo glucose
biosensors were first assessed via the Clarke error grid.39 The percentage of BG measurements falling in
zones A and B (clinically accurate and clinically benign determinations,
respectively) of the error grid are shown in Table 2. On the day of implantation (day 0), the MAP3/NO-based sensors
performed slightly worse than control sensors, with a 2% difference
in the percentage of determinations in zones A and B. However, the
performance of MAP3/NO sensors on days 1 and 3 was superior to that
of controls, with >7% difference in the percentage of clinically
accurate
and acceptable determinations. Concomitant with improved clinical
performance, sensors that rapidly released NO were characterized as
having greater glucose sensitivity on days 1 and 3 (0.59 ± 0.54
and 0.59 ± 0.40 nA mM–1, respectively) versus
controls (0.14 ± 0.09 and 0.18 ± 0.04 nA mM–1, respectively). However, the MAP3/NO sensors exhibited similar clinical
accuracy and glucose sensitivity to control sensors at implant periods
beyond 3 days (i.e., days 7 and 10), suggesting that sensor performance
is only improved during periods of active NO release. The trends in
sensor clinical performance and glucose sensitivity correlate well
with the NO-release kinetics from the sensors, with clear benefits
to sensor performance early during in vivo use (i.e., days 1 and 3)
but no improvements after the NO supply was exhausted. Of note, Nichols
et al. noted no decrease in the FBR (>1 w) for implants with rapid
NO release, suggesting that inflammation may be the primary culprit
for decreased sensor performance beyond 3 d.25 Unexpectedly, the MPTMS-RSNO-based sensors exhibited clinical accuracy
similar to that of MPTMS control sensors throughout the 10 d in vivo
study. The sensitivity of the MPTMS-RSNO sensors to glucose appeared
slightly greater than that of MPTMS controls beyond day 0, but these
differences were not significant (p > 0.05). This
result may be due to the low, sustained NO fluxes released from sensors
when compared to those from the MAP3/NO-based sensors (Table 1).

Of importance, the majority (∼70%) of BG determinations
were obtained in the 50–100 mg dL–1 range,
as shown in the representative Clarke error grid analysis in Figure
S4 of the SI. In addition to the similarities
between swine and humans (e.g., skin, vasculature, subcutaneous tissue
composition) which render the pig an appropriate model for evaluating
in vivo biosensors, baseline blood glucose concentrations obtained
in this study were comparable to human euglycemic levels.26,50−52 As maintenance of euglycemia increases the propensity
of diabetic individuals to enter the hypoglycemic BG range,53 the Clarke error grid presents austere requirements
for sensor accuracy in this region. Thus, the error grid analysis
presented herein is at BG levels clinically and physiologically pertinent
to humans.

Biosensor Numerical Accuracy and Adherence
to ISO Criteria
To evaluate in vivo biosensor performance
in more detail, the sensor
numerical accuracy was represented using the MARD of each sensor from
corresponding reference values.38 While
the Clarke error grid measures sensor accuracy based on the clinical
implications of a given BG measurement, the MARD represents a statistical
entity that exemplifies the average percent deviation of the sensor
from a reference. Additionally, ISO criteria for in vivo glucose biosensor
performance was considered as a metric for numerical accuracy because
it can be used to assess sensor accuracy in both hypoglycemic (≤70
mg dL–1) and euglycemic/hyperglycemic (>70 mg
dL–1) BG ranges separately.38 A comparison of the numerical accuracies for control and NO-releasing
sensors is shown in Figure 1. As anticipated,
the analytical performance of MAP3/NO-based sensors on days 1 and
3 was superior to that of MAP3 (control) sensors. The improvements
in numerical accuracy agree with the increased clinical accuracy and
greater glucose sensitivity for the more rapid NO-releasing sensors.
Furthermore, the performance of the MAP3/NO-based sensors was observed
to worsen beyond 3 d implantation. The desirably lower MARD for rapid
NO-releasing glucose sensors is attributed to the improved accuracy
in both the hypoglycemic and euglycemic/hyperglycemic ranges, as shown
in Table 3. Indeed, >55% of the total BG
determinations
obtained by MAP3/NO-based sensors agreed well with corresponding reference
measurements in both BG ranges on days 1 and 3. Unexpectedly, the
MARD for control (MAP3) sensors was lowest at 7 d implantation (21.9
± 13.1%). Despite the inconsistent numerical accuracy for control
sensors, the analytical performance was comparable to NO-releasing
sensors at both 7 and 10 d.

Figure 1 Comparison of MARD for (A) MAP3/NO (red circle)
and control (MAP3)
sensors (black, square) and (B) MPTMS-RSNO (red circle) and control
(MPTMS) (black, square) sensors. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the median value for the MARD are indicated
with an asterisk.

Although the clinical
accuracy of the MPTMS-RSNO-based sensors
was comparable to that of controls, the numerical accuracy of NO-releasing
sensors remained constant (MARD range 22.2–26.0%) throughout
the experiment. Furthermore, the sensors that released NO for extended
durations exhibited a significantly lower MARD on days 1 and 3 (26.0
± 5.1 and 23.9 ± 8.6%, respectively) versus controls (34.3
± 10.9 and 38.8 ± 10.4%, respectively). We attribute the
good agreement between MPTMS-RSNO sensors and reference measurements
to the increased accuracy of the NO-releasing biosensors in both the
hypoglycemic and euglycemic/hyperglycemic BG ranges. The percentage
of determinations for MPTMS-RSNO-based sensors that adhered to ISO
criteria was typically >50% throughout implantation, while control
sensor performance worsened with implant duration, particularly in
the hypoglycemic range. The stable biosensor response provided by
the sustained NO-releasing sensor membranes highlights the utility
of NO release for continuous glucose monitoring.

Of importance, the NO-release kinetics also correlated with the
magnitude of the improvement in numerical accuracy for NO-releasing
sensors versus controls. For example, MAP3/NO-based sensors showed
vastly decreased MARD versus MAP3 (control) sensors on day 1 (22.0
± 6.6 and 47.3 ± 8.1%, respectively), whereas sensors with
longer NO-release durations (MPTMS-RSNO) exhibited more modest improvements
relative to controls (28.4 ± 5.9 and 34.3 ± 10.9%, respectively).
However, the differences in the MARD between MAP3/NO and MPTMS-RSNO
sensors on days 1 and 3 were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The enhanced numerical accuracy afforded by
rapid
NO release from sensor membranes indicates a possible advantage to
greater NO fluxes, as MAP3/NO-based sensors delivered ∼3.1
μmol cm–2 NO in <24 h. While MPTMS-RSNO
sensors had a near constant MARD throughout the experiment duration,
the improvements in numerical accuracy provided by lower, more sustained
NO release may not have been large enough to result in improved clinical
performance. Collectively, these results suggest that sensor performance
benefits to a greater extent with prolonged NO release and that these
gains are dependent on the fluxes at which NO is liberated.

Biosensor
Lag Time
While poor glucose sensitivity often
contributes to undesirable sensor performance in vivo, diminished
accuracy also results from sluggish response of the sensor to changes
in BG levels.54 In addition to an inherent
blood–tissue glucose lag, progression of the FBR increases
the difficulty of glucose diffusion to the sensor. Distinct properties
of the collagen capsule (i.e., thickness, density, and avascularity)
produced upon resolution of the foreign body response have been shown
to affect the transport properties of small molecules in the subcutaneous
tissue.12−14 Even in the absence of a mature fibrotic capsule,
biofouling and inflammation at the sensor–tissue interface
may create a diffusion barrier to glucose.55 As amperometric glucose biosensors are diffusion-limited with respect
to glucose, a longer response time may hinder the competence of the
sensor to track rapid changes in BG levels, resulting in decreased
accuracy. Since tissue surrounding NO-releasing implants exhibits
less inflammation,23−25 reduced collagen encapsulation,23,25 and low impedance to glucose transport,24 NO-releasing sensors may show more rapid response to changes in
BG. While time-shifting methods (i.e., Poincaré dynamical analysis)
have been used to correct CGM data for time-lag effects,35,36 calibration of the sensor signal may corrupt a comparison of sensor
lag times. Cross-correlation of the raw sensor signals and paired
reference signals were thus used to estimate sensor delay, avoiding
the requirement for sensor calibration.40,41

Initially
(i.e., 0–1 d implant period), NO release had little effect
on sensor lag times (Figure 2). However, NO
release did impact sensor lag times on days 3, 7, and 10. The MPTMS-RSNO-based
sensors yielded a faster response to changing glucose concentrations
during the IVGTT (<4.2 min) compared with both control (MPTMS)
and MAP3/NO-based sensors (>5.8 min). As well, the response time
of
the MAP3/NO-based sensors worsened with implantation time analogous
to control sensors, suggesting that the benefit of reduced response
time is only attained when sensors are still releasing NO. Despite
similar NO payloads, the difference in lag time between the two types
of NO-releasing sensors is corroborated by the work of Nichols et
al.,25 in which rapid NO release at 3 and
7 d yielded no reduction in FBR, while extended NO release provided
a lessened FBR at both 3 and 7 d. Likewise, sustained NO release from
percutaneously implanted microdialysis probes reduced tissue impedance
to glucose transport,24 which may explain
the reduced sensor lag time observed in the present study.

biosensors (blue inverted triangle) exhibited significantly reduced
lag times on days 3, 7, and 10 versus MAP3/NO sensors (red circle),
and MAP3 and MPTMS controls (black square and green triangle, respectively).
Asterisks denote significant differences (p <

Postexplantation Analysis
Approximately 40% of implanted
NO-releasing and control sensors functioned beyond 3 d, indicating
a limitation in this study. Following sensor explantation, the sensors
were imaged via environmental scanning electron microscopy to investigate
the implant surfaces and perhaps understand the potential sources
of sensor failure. Representative scanning electron micrographs (SEMs)
of the surface of the sensors are provided in SI (Figure S5). Electrical failure via membrane delamination
or cracking contributed considerably to in vivo sensor failure. Most
likely, mechanical stresses to the percutaneous sensor were at fault
for damage to the sensor membranes.50 Koschwanez
et al. previously reported that micromotion and the associated stress
for percutaneous implants yielded unanticipated results for studies
evaluating glucose sensor coatings.56 Indeed,
the significant mechanical stress to percutaneous implants convolutes
the interpretation of sensor failure. Nonetheless, percutaneous glucose
sensors remain the most realistic method for implementing continuous
glucose monitoring, due to their low cost and facile implantation,
and serve as a suitable model for evaluating candidate biomaterials.50,57 Furthermore, NO has been shown to provide benefits to percutaneous
implants even in the presence of such physical factors.24

Conclusions
Nitric oxide was shown
to clearly enhance the analytical performance
of in vivo glucose biosensors with the associated benefits being dependent
on the NO-release kinetics from the outer sensor membranes. Both rapid
and extended NO-releasing sensors exhibited improved numerical accuracy
versus controls. Rapid NO release from sensors resulted in positive
differences in both clinical accuracy and glucose sensitivity, while
sustained NO release from MPTMS-RSNO biosensors provided constant
numerical accuracy over the entire 10 d implant period. The MPTMS-RSNO
sensors were characterized by a quicker response to the IVGTT than
both the MPTMS control and MAP3-based sensors, which we attribute
to the sustained generation of NO. It is hypothesized that shorter
lag times for the MPTMS-RSNO sensors are the result of improved glucose
transport to the sensor from the tissue surrounding the implants.
The predictable performance of MPTMS-RSNO glucose biosensors suggests
that materials that are capable of releasing large NO payloads for
even longer durations (i.e., several weeks) represent the ultimate
NO-release strategy for long-term glucose sensing technologies (i.e.,
months), rather than the short-term (i.e., ∼10 d) period that
was the focus of this study. However, the effects of NO on diabetic
tissue may be dissimilar. Indeed, diabetic tissue is characterized
by numerous deficiencies including altered wound repair,58,59 lessened inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production at
wound sites,59 disrupted blood flow,60 and susceptibility to infection.61 Work characterizing the response of diabetic
tissue to implantation has been limited thus far. The disparities
between diabetic and healthy tissue motivate the need for understanding
the diabetic response to sensor implantation and warrant a careful
investigation of the role of NO on the diabetic FBR. Planning of these
studies in a diabetic swine model is ongoing.
