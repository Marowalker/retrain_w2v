Analytical
methods based on mass spectrometry (MS) have been successfully
applied in biomarker discovery studies, while the role of MS in translating
biomarker candidates to clinical diagnostics is less pronounced. MALDImmunoassays—methods
that combine immunoaffinity enrichment with matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric
detection—are attractive analytical approaches for large-scale
sample analysis by virtue of their ease of operation and high-throughput
capabilities. Despite this fact, MALDImmunoassays are not widely used
in clinical diagnostics, which is mainly due to the limited availability
of internal standards that can adequately correct for variability
in sample preparation and the MALDI process itself. Here we present
a novel MALDImmunoassay for quantification of insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF1) in human plasma. Reliable IGF1 quantification in the
range of 10–1000 ng/mL was achieved by employing 15N-IGF1 as internal standard, which proved to be an essential feature
of the IGF1 MALDImmunoassay. The method was validated according to
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, which included
demonstrating the effectiveness of IGF1/IGF binding protein (IGF1/IGFBP)
complex dissociation using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Furthermore,
the MALDImmunoassay compared well with the IDS-iSYS IGF1 immunoassay
with high correlation (R2 = 0.99), although
substantially lower levels were reported by the MALDImmunoassay. The
method was tested on >1000 samples from a cohort of renal transplant
recipients to assess its performance in a clinical setting. On the
basis of this study, we identified readouts to monitor the quality
of the measurements. Our work shows that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
is suitable for quantitative biomarker analysis provided that an appropriate
internal standard is used and that readouts are monitored to assess
the quality of the measurements.

==== Body
The number
of newly discovered
biomarker candidates has increased dramatically in recent years following
the rise of modern omics approaches. However, only few of these biomarkers
have made their way into clinical practice.1 This discrepancy reflects
the gap between biomarker discovery and validation and stresses the
need for breaking the bottleneck(s) of the biomarker development pipeline.2−4 To address this need, many efforts are currently being deployed
to translate biomarker research into clinical practice.1,2,5

In the past decade, mass
spectrometry (MS) has found wider acceptance
in biomarker validation studies.4,5 In particular, the combination
of immunoaffinity enrichment and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is gaining momentum.
This approach, which we denote by the generic term “MALDImmunoassay”,
holds considerable promise for biomarker validation studies because
of its ease of use as well as its automation and multiplexing capabilities.6 In fact, a substantial number of these approaches
have been described in the past years, including various MSIA (mass
spectrometric immunoassay) (i.e., on-target elution of intact proteins/peptides
which are enriched using antibody-coated microcolumns),7−21 SISCAPA-MALDI (i.e., spotting of proteotypic peptides which are
enriched using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads),22,23 and iMALDI methods (i.e., spotting of antibody-conjugated magnetic
beads containing enriched proteotypic peptides)24−28 as well as other approaches without distinct denominations.29−34

In light of the potential application of MALDImmunoassays
in clinical
diagnostics, it is important to note that MALDI-TOF MS has already
made its entrance into routine clinical practice. Bruker’s
Biotyper and bioMérieux’s Vitek are two approved analytical
platforms that have transformed species determination in medical microbiology.35 Although clinical application of MALDI-TOF MS
has been successful for microbial species determination, its application
for biomarker quantitation has not yet reached its full potential,
and challenges for MALDImmunoassays are still numerous and substantial.
In particular, a cornerstone of high-quality quantitative assays is
good internal standardization.34 As MALDImmunoassays
employ antibodies which may be sources of variation, an internal standard
must be able to compensate for variability during the immunoaffinity
enrichment step.36 Furthermore, inasmuch
as MALDI-TOF detection is known for its nonlinear relationship between
signal intensity and analyte concentration, internal standards (preferably
stable-isotope-labeled, SIL) must also compensate for detection variability.37 Indeed, most MALDImmunoassays employ internal
standards, although some of these standards exhibit substantial structural
and chemical differences compared to the authentic analyte.34 Therefore, some methods may benefit from improving
the internal standardization which may even advance their maturation
into clinical diagnostics.

An example of a clinically relevant
biomarker that has been targeted
by MALDImmunoassays is insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1).9,18 IGF1, a 7.65 kDa polypeptide hormone, is the main mediator of growth
hormone (GH)-stimulated cell and tissue growth. In laboratory medicine,
IGF1 is routinely measured to diagnose GH deficiency as well as to
test for an excess of GH leading to abnormal growth in children (e.g.,
gigantism) or as the result of a pituitary tumor (e.g., acromegaly).18 Furthermore, IGF1 is an important measure to
detect abuse of GH and IGF1 in sport, and numerous IGF1 measurements
are annually conducted in the field of doping analysis.38,39

The most recently published IGF1 MALDImmunoassay is a high-throughput
assay based on the MSIA principle.18 This
method employs specific antibody-coated microcolumns that are compatible
with selected liquid handling platforms, and is thereby capable of
measuring >1000 samples per day. The method employs the doping
agent
LONGR3IGF1 as internal standard, which is an
IGF1 analogue with increased potency due to a lower binding affinity
to circulating IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) compared to IGF1.38 This feature, however, likely affects the appropriateness
of LONGR3IGF1 as internal standard for IGF1,
since it implies that this analogue may not correct adequately for
the extraction of IGF1 from IGFBP-containing matrixes, such as serum
and plasma. Furthermore, the two additional methionine residues in
the N-terminal extension of this protein may lead to formation of
different oxidation products compared to IGF1 during the analytical
procedures.38 Thus, chemical differences
between IGF1 and LONGR3IGF1 may cause variation
in the signals for both compounds.

In this work, we present
a MALDImmunoassay for quantification of
IGF1 in human plasma which uses a fully 15N-labeled recombinant
version of IGF1 as internal standard. The method was validated according
to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines,40 and its performance was subsequently tested
in a clinical setting using >1000 samples from a cohort of renal
transplant
recipients. On the basis of this large-scale study, we identified
indicators of measurement quality which may aid in making MALDI-TOF
MS a reliable bioanalytical assay platform.

Experimental Section
Materials
Recombinant human IGF1 (cat. no. CYT-216), 15N-IGF1
(cat. no. CYT-128), and IGFBP3 (cat. no. CYT-300)
were purchased from ProSpec (Ness-Ziona, Israel). Polyclonal anti-IGF1
antibody (cat. no. PA0362) was obtained from Cell Sciences (Newburyport,
MA, U.S.A.). Pierce Protein A/G magnetic beads (cat. no. 88802/3)
were acquired from Fisher Scientific (Landsmeer, The Netherlands),
and these were separated using a Promega MagnaBot 96 separation device.
Acetonitrile (ACN; LC–MS grade) was purchased from Biosolve
(Valkenswaard, The Netherlands), sinapinic acid (cat. no. M002) was
from LaserBio Laboratories (Sophia-Antipolis, France), and polystyrene
U-bottom microtiter plates (cat. no. 650-101) were obtained from Greiner
Bio-One (Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands). All other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).

Plasma Samples
For method development and preparation
of QC samples, a bulk quantity of human plasma from Seralabs (West
Sussex, U.K.) was used. This plasma was either used directly as QC-medium
sample, diluted four times with rat plasma (obtained from Seralabs)
to prepare the QC-low sample, or fortified with recombinant IGF1 to
obtain the QC-high sample. Spike recovery experiments were carried
out using six different sources of human plasma (all from Seralabs).
For method testing, 1038 plasma samples were analyzed from a cohort
of renal transplant recipients (plus screened donors and healthy controls)
that is being studied at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG).41 For this study, ethical approval has been granted
by the UMCG’s review board (METc 2008/186), and the study adheres
to the Declaration of Helsinki. Blood was collected in plastic K2EDTA tubes (BD, cat. no. 367525) and centrifuged for 10 min
at 1300g at room temperature. After collecting the
plasma fraction, samples were aliquoted into 2 mL polypropylene storage
tubes (Sarstedt, cat. no. 72.609). Samples were stored at −80
°C until further analysis.

Calibrants and Internal
Standard
Lyophilized IGF1 was
reconstituted in 2% ovalbumin (in 100 mM PBS, pH 7.2) to obtain a
200 μg/mL solution. This solution was diluted to 10 μg/mL
with rat plasma or 2% ovalbumin to obtain a stock solution for calibration
or sample fortification purposes, respectively. Using the stock solution
in rat plasma, calibration samples were prepared in rat plasma at
10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng/mL. For the internal standard
(IS), lyophilized 15N-IGF1 was reconstituted in 10 mM ammonium
bicarbonate to obtain a 500 μg/mL solution. After checking the
compound’s (isotopic) purity by MALDI-TOF MS, the stock was
diluted sequentially in 2% ovalbumin to obtain a 400 ng/mL IS working
solution.

Immunoaffinity Enrichment
Three microliters of magnetic
beads was washed thrice with 100 μL of wash buffer (0.1% Tween-20
in 100 mM PBS, pH 7.2) and incubated (1 h; 750 rpm) in 100 μL
of wash buffer containing 0.5 μg of antibody. Next, unbound
antibody was removed following three washing steps with 100 μL
of wash buffer. During incubation of the beads with the antibody,
20 μL of sample was combined with 10 μL of IS working
solution, and the sample was incubated (5 min; 900 rpm) to allow complexing
of the IS with the IGFBPs. Subsequently, 50 μL of dissociation
buffer (0.3% SDS in wash buffer) was added, and the sample was incubated
(30 min; 900 rpm) to enable dissociation of IGF1/IGFBP complexes.
After diluting the dissociated sample with 50 μL of wash buffer,
this mixture was added to the antibody-conjugated beads for immunoaffinity
enrichment of IGF1 (1 h; 750 rpm). Subsequently, the beads were washed
thrice with 100 μL of wash buffer and once with 100 μL
of Milli-Q water, prior to elution of IGF1 from the beads (10 min;
900 rpm) with 20 μL of elution solution (0.45% TFA plus 33%
ACN in H2O). Finally, 5 μL of eluate was mixed 1:1
with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in elution solution, and
1 μL of this mixture was spotted in quadruplicate onto a polished
steel MALDI target plate. The immunopurification workflow was automated
with an Agilent Bravo liquid handling platform equipped with a 96-channel
LT pipetting head.

MALDI-TOF MS
Linear positive MALDI-TOF
spectra were
recorded between 4000 and 10 000 Da with a Bruker ultrafleXtreme
mass spectrometer operated under Bruker flexControl software (version
3.4). Acquisition was performed under the following conditions: 50
ns delayed extraction; signal deflection up to m/z 4000; 2 kHz Smartbeam-II UV laser (Nd:YAG; λ = 355
nm) operating with the “4_large” parameter set; 5 GS/s
digitizer sampling rate; ion source 1, 2, and lens voltages of 25.00,
23.30, and 5.75 kV, respectively. For every sample, 2500 shots were
acquired in 100 shot steps following a “hexagon” measuring
raster, although only spectra of sufficient resolution (≥500,
after “Centroid” peak detection (peak width = 5 m/z) using “TopHat” baseline
subtraction) were averaged for each mass spectrum.

Data Processing
MALDI spectra were smoothed (SavitzkyGolay
filter; width = 5 m/z; cycles =
1), baseline-subtracted (median; flatness = 0.1; median level = 0.5),
and peaks were detected and integrated (centroid algorithm; peak width
= 5 m/z) using Bruker flexAnalysis
software (version 3.4). Peak intensity values for the IGF1 and 15N-IGF1 peaks as well as for their oxidation peaks were retrieved
from obtained mass lists and processed further using customized Microsoft
Excel (versions 2010 and 2013) spreadsheets.

Method Validation
The method was validated based on
FDA guidelines on bioanalytical method validation.40 The following criteria were addressed: selectivity (e.g.,
spike recovery and IGFBP3 challenge test), accuracy and precision,
calibration curve, and stability (e.g., 24 h benchtop, 3× freeze–thaw,
and 7 days MALDI sample stability). With respect to the selectivity
tests, samples were spiked with IGF1 (25, 100, and 500 ng/mL) or IGFBP3
(2500 ng/mL; protein was reconstituted and diluted in 2% ovalbumin),
and incubated for 30 min prior to analysis with the MALDImmunoassay.
This incubation step was included to allow complexing of IGF1 with
IGFBP3 and other IGF binding proteins. Furthermore, the method was
compared with the IDS-iSYS IGF1 assay using a cohort consisting of
20 “normal” samples and 20 samples from patients with
growth hormone deficiency or excess.42

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Mass Spectra
Figure 1A shows a
linear positive MALDI-TOF MS spectrum
representative of the clinical samples that were measured. The intense
peaks at m/z 7650 and 7743 represent
IGF1 and 15N-IGF1, respectively. Both peaks are accompanied
by their sinapinic acid adduct peaks (+206 mass units), as well as
by a peak around m/z 8350, which
was previously observed and denoted as a possible IGF1 variant.18Figure 1A also features a zoom-in of the spectrum between 7.6 and
7.8 kDa, clearly displaying the oxidation peaks of both IGF1 and 15N-IGF1, which likely arise as the result of oxidation of
the methionine residue at position 59. The percent abundance of these
oxidation peaks (relative to the cumulative intensity of the oxidized
and nonoxidized peaks) was monitored, and on average, oxidation peak
abundances for IGF1 and 15N-IGF1 were around 15% for the
clinical samples. In order to assess analytical accuracy, the constancy
of the ratio between these abundances was monitored and ensured for
all samples (see the Quality Assessment of MALDI
Measurements section).

Figure 1 (A) MALDImmunoassay spectrum of IGF1 in plasma
from an individual
expressing wild-type IGF1 and (B) from an individual expressing wild-type
IGF1 and an IGF1 variant giving rise to a 30 m/z mass increase which likely arises from an alanine-to-threonine
substitution at position 67 or 70. Besides peaks originating from
IGF1 and 15N-IGF1, MALDI spectra also displayed peaks representing
sinapinic acid adducts of IGF1 (†) and 15N-IGF1
(‡) as well as an unknown peak that was previously (ref (18)) denoted as a possible
IGF1 variant (§). In addition, panel A features a zoom-in of
the spectrum between 7.6 and 7.8 kDa displaying oxidation peaks of
IGF1 and 15N-IGF1.

Figure 1B
displays
a spectrum that contains an additional IGF1 signal at m/z 7680, which was observed in one out of more than
1000 clinical samples. This IGF1 variant has been observed previously
and could originate from a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) giving rise to an alanine-to-threonine substitution at position
67 (rs17884626) or 70 (rs151098426).18,43 In samples from patients carrying these SNPs, a large discrepancy
can be expected between IGF1 levels based on wild-type IGF1 as obtained
with the MALDImmunoassay and those that are obtained with conventional
immunoassays or even with available liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) methods targeting proteotypic IGF1 peptides
that do not cover the regions relevant for detection of these SNPs.
Intensities of the peaks at m/z 7650
and 7680 may be summed up to give the total concentration of these
IGF1 proteoforms; however, it is currently unknown whether the biological
potencies of these variants are the same as the potency of wild-type
IGF1.

Selection of Internal Standard and Calibration Matrix
For quantitative MALDI-TOF MS (and quantitative MS methods in general),
calibration is ideally performed with authentic analyte in authentic
matrix and by using an SIL version of the authentic analyte as internal
standard (IS).44,45 Given that IGF1-free human plasma
was not available, we studied the applicability of several surrogate
matrixes, including bovine serum albumin in PBS and plasma from other
species. Corresponding experiments indicated that a high degree of
similarity between the authentic and surrogate matrix was needed,
notably to compensate for technical variation during the IGF1/IGFBP
complex dissociation step and for the influence of sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) during the subsequent immunocapture of IGF1. Ultimately,
rat plasma was selected as surrogate matrix since it enables reliable
IGF1 quantitation (as demonstrated during method validation; see below),
and because its constituents and rat IGF1 in particular do not interfere
with measuring human IGF1 or the internal standard (as depicted in Figure S-1). In addition, rat plasma does not
give rise to signals that interfere with known endogenous IGF1 variants
(e.g., des(1–3)IGF1, IGF1 A67T, and IGF1 A70T) or synthetic
IGF1 analogues that may be used as doping agents (e.g., R3IGF1 and LONGR3IGF1).

As mentioned
above, SIL versions of analytes are the preferred internal standards
for MALDImmunoassays. Such standards allow accurate compensation for
variability in both sample preparation and MS detection; however,
SIL analogues are not readily available for every protein. In cases
when such analogues are not available, alternative internal standards
(e.g., close structural analogues) may be appropriate, though justification
of their applicability must be supported by full method validation
according to internationally recognized guidelines (e.g., EMA, FDA,
and/or CLSI guidelines).46

Differences
in analytical behavior between analytes and alternative
internal standards should ideally be absent, though it is not inconceivable
that differences become apparent, which we experienced when using
LONGR3IGF1 as internal standard for IGF1.18 We found that LONGR3IGF1
is not an ideal internal standard for IGF1, since an equimolar mixture
of both compounds yielded an over 5-fold higher intensity for IGF1
compared to LONGR3IGF1. More importantly, some
MALDI-TOF spectra revealed three oxidation peaks for LONGR3IGF1 compared to only one for IGF1 (see Figure S-2). Most probably, the two additional
methionine residues of the LONG peptide were oxidized and gave rise
to these peaks. On the contrary, ionization efficiency and oxidation
behavior of 15N-IGF1 were highly similar to IGF1 (see Figure 1), and therefore,
we employed 15N-IGF1 as internal standard to accurately
compensate for variability during the entire analytical procedure.

Assay Characteristics
Results from the method validation
experiments are included in Tables S-1–S-10 (Supporting Information), while Table 1 displays a concise summary of the validation
data. The calibration curve (1/x weighting) consisted
of seven nonzero standards with values ranging from 10 ng/mL (LLOQ:
CV and bias ±20%) to 1000 ng/mL. Signal intensities based on
peak height and peak area were both evaluated during method validation,
yet peak height was ultimately selected for calculation of the IGF1
levels as it gave more accurate results, which has also been reported
previously.34,47,48

b The average value of measured concentrations
during the precision and accuracy experiments was used as nominal
concentration.

Evaluation
of accuracy and precision as well as all stability assessments
demonstrated biases and coefficients of variation (CVs) within ±15%.
Notably, observed CVs were lowest for the midrange QC samples, which
has also been observed by others.22,34,49,50 For corresponding IGF1
levels, the analyte and internal standard were present on the MALDI
spot in near equimolar amounts, which appears to be favorable for
the internal standard’s effectiveness in correcting for variation
arising from the MALDI-TOF process. This effect was further demonstrated
by calculating 4-spot CVs for each sample and by relating these to
the corresponding (4-spot) IGF1/15N-IGF1 ratios (Figure S-3 displays graphical representations
of these relationships for four selected analytical runs carried out
for clinical sample analysis). Observed variation was typically lowest
for IGF1/15N-IGF1 ratios around 1 and increased with both
higher and lower ratios. These observations illustrate the generally
limited span of calibration ranges for MALDI-TOF MS-based quantitative
methods. Furthermore, these results also emphasize the need to match
the amount of spiked internal standard to the median of expected concentrations,
or to the level that is most important for clinical decision making.

It is of particular relevance for quantitative IGF1 assays to ensure
that IGF1 is properly liberated from its binding proteins (e.g., IGFBP3)
and to demonstrate that these binding proteins do not interfere with
the assay. For this assay, disruption of IGF1/IGFBP complexes was
realized by treating samples with SDS, similar to the approaches of
previously published IGF1 methods.9,18,38,51−53 The
effectiveness of this step was demonstrated by means of an IGFBP3
challenge test, in which calibration and QC samples were spiked with
an excess of IGFBP3, as well as through spike recovery experiments
using six different sources of human plasma. After the samples were
spiked with IGFBP3 or IGF1, they were incubated for 30 min to allow
IGF1/IGFBP complex formation. Subsequently, samples were analyzed
with the MALDImmunoassay to assess accuracy and precision. Results
of these experiments showed that SDS treatment does not introduce
a significant bias or imprecision into the assay (±15%), and
thereby demonstrate (to our understanding for the first time) the
effectiveness of an SDS-based strategy for IGF1/IGFBP complex dissociation.

The MALDImmunoassay was compared with the IDS-iSYS IGF1 immunoassay
using a set of 40 clinical samples42 (corresponding
scatter and Bland–Altman plots are shown in Figure 2). The negative intercept of
the regression line in Figure 2A and the positive relative differences in Figure 2B indicate that there is a
bias between the measurements with the IDS-iSYS IGF1 immunoassay giving
higher values than the MALDImmunoassay. This bias may be explained
by the different assay principles of both methods. With the MALDImmunoassay,
IGF1 levels are calculated solely based on the response of IGF1 with
a mass of 7649 Da, while the IDS-iSYS IGF1 immunoassay may also respond
to other IGF1 proteoforms, such as des(1–3)IGF1, proteolytic
fragments, and potential post-translational modifications of IGF1
that escape the MALDImmunoassay.

Figure 2 Comparison between the IGF1 MALDImmunoassay
and the IDS-iSYS IGF1
immunoassay using (A) linear regression and (B) the Bland–Altman
plot.

Moreover, Figure 2 indicates that there are two regions with
different biases, one
for lower IGF1 concentrations (below ±150 ng/mL) and one for
higher IGF1 concentrations (above ±150 ng/mL). For the lower
concentrations, there is a relative difference between the assays
of approximately 60% which decreases to about 20% for the higher concentrations.
Lower values for the MALDImmunoassay may be due to preanalytical variables
leading to a reduced availability of wild-type IGF1 (e.g., proteolytic
degradation, methionine oxidation) or may be caused by incomplete
IGF1 extraction from specific plasma samples. Higher levels for the
IDS-iSYS IGF1 immunoassay may be the result of cross-reactivity of
the antibodies, which cannot be checked due to the detection principle
of this assay. In order to elucidate the reason(s) for the observed
bias, further research is needed.

As for the above-mentioned
preanalytical variables, we must acknowledge
that potential degradation products may be “missed”
by the MALDImmunoassay. Yet, this characteristic could either be an
advantage or a disadvantage of this assay depending on which samples
and clinical questions are being studied. The MALDImmunoassay has
the distinct advantage over IGF1 immunoassays that the levels obtained
are based on defined chemical information and thereby relate to one
IGF1 proteoform with a given potency, whereas methods that respond
to multiple IGF1 proteoforms with different potencies yield IGF1 levels
that cannot be directly related to potency. In particular, des(1–3)IGF1
and LONGR3IGF1 are known to be more potent
than wild-type IGF1, which is presumably caused by altered binding
affinities toward IGFBPs as a result of N-terminal structural differences.38,54 The MALDImmunoassay discriminates wild-type IGF1 from these variants
and thereby allows separate detection of these variants in the same
experiment. When including calibrants and proper internal standards
for these compounds, the resulting assay may even be used to quantify
specific variants, which could be of interest, for example, in the
field of doping analysis. Ultimately, one method is not necessarily
better than the other, and the choice of the method for specific applications
should depend on the available samples as well as the relevant clinical
questions.

Quality Assessment of MALDI Measurements
To study the
performance of the MALDImmunoassay more extensively, the method was
applied to over 1000 clinical samples (analysis and interpretation
of the clinical data will be reported in future publications). Ninety-six
samples were processed per analytical run (i.e., 81 clinical samples,
8 calibrants, 1 blank, and duplicate QC-L, QC-M, and QC-H samples),
and the full set of samples was analyzed within 2 weeks. After a few
runs, we observed that more time was needed per sample to reach the
required number of acceptable spectra (with sufficient resolution).
Peaks that fulfilled the preset acquisition specifications could not
be found easily, and total MALDI measurement time increased significantly
as a consequence. Ultimately, we found that this prolongation of analysis
time was due to accumulation of matrix deposits in the MALDI source,
and that this prolongation could be reversed by cleaning the source.
Cleaning, however, necessitates venting of the instrument, so it goes
hand in hand with considerable instrument downtime. Thus, maintaining
good analytical quality comes at the price of reducing the method’s
(weekly) throughput.

To assess whether matrix deposits in the
source affect data quality, we searched for readouts that allowed
monitoring of data quality. In this regard, we observed that in parallel
with the increasing analysis time the relative abundances of oxidation
peaks also increased (Figure 3A, runs 1, 4, and 8). These abundances decreased again after
cleaning of the source (Figure 3A, run 12), thereby confirming that accumulating deposits
in the source led to increased IGF1 oxidation during MALDI-TOF analysis,
which is most likely due to prolonged exposure of the samples to UV
irradiation. Subsequently, we calculated the ratio between the relative
oxidation peaks of IGF1 and 15N-IGF1, since methionine
oxidation is not necessarily problematic if the internal standard
can correct for this phenomenon. Figure 3B shows these ratios for four of the analytical
runs carried out for clinical sample analysis (i.e., runs 1, 4, 8,
and 12) and indicates that corresponding distributions are slightly
different for the displayed runs. The impact of these differences
on the reported IGF1 levels is, however, limited, which becomes apparent
when comparing “regularly calculated” IGF1 levels with
IGF1 levels that are calculated using the sum of peak intensities
from both nonoxidized and oxidized IGF1 (see Figure S-4). The differences between the obtained concentrations are
well within ±15%, with the exception of two samples for run 8
(see Figure S-5), and indicate that data
was not substantially affected by matrix deposits in the source. Nonetheless,
these figures highlight the significance of an appropriate cleaning
interval for the MALDI source and also emphasize the need for using 15N-IGF1 as internal standard. Eventually, we believe that
monitoring oxidation peaks would be of interest for IGF1 (and potentially
also for other methionine-containing proteins) as it enables one to
follow changing conditions in the MALDI source thus allowing to establish
criteria for regular cleaning.

Figure 3 (A) Bee swarm plots of the relative abundance
of the IGF1 oxidation
peak and (B) the ratio of the IGF1 and 15N-IGF1 relative
abundances as observed in 4 (of the 13) analytical runs carried out
for clinical sample analysis. With respect to the selected runs, the
MALDI source was cleaned after run 8; thus, runs 1, 4, and 8 are shown
to illustrate the effect of an increasing level of matrix deposits
in the source, and run 12 is shown to illustrate the effect of cleaning
the source. In order to calculate the relative abundances, the peak
intensity of the oxidized analyte was divided by the sum of the peak
intensities from the “native” and the oxidized analyte.
To calculate the ratio, the relative abundance of the IGF1 oxidation
peak was divided by the relative abundance of the 15N-IGF1
oxidation peak.

Besides evaluating oxidation
peak abundances, we also monitored
the variation between the results obtained for the different MALDI
spots belonging to the same sample. Following the calculation of 4-spot
CV values for every sample, a straightforward measure for monitoring
MALDI measurement quality was obtained, which is not dependent on
an analyte’s chemical composition (e.g., whether it contains
one or more methionine residues). Figure 4 shows observed 4-spot CV values plotted
against the corresponding IGF1/15N-IGF1 ratios for the
samples of a run that was performed under optimal analytical conditions
(run 1) and for samples that were obtained with a “dirty”
source (run 8). This graph is rather revealing in several ways. First,
the patterns of both data series show that variation is typically
lowest when IGF1 and the IS are present in equimolar amounts. This
finding is in line with our previous observation that the precision
for the midrange QC samples was better than that of the QC-low and
QC-high samples (see above). Second, 4-spot variation is clearly larger
when the source contains matrix deposits and thus is in need of cleaning.
We adopted a 4-spot CV cutoff value of 10% to ensure acceptable measurement
quality. All samples with 4-spot CVs exceeding this value were reanalyzed
with a clean source which resulted in CVs well below 10%. Admittedly,
monitoring 4-spot variation necessitates using multiple spots per
sample which affects the method’s throughput. Nevertheless,
we recommend to monitor this quality indicator to ensure accurate
data acquisition and to follow accumulation of matrix deposits in
the source (additional data that support this recommendation are shown
in Figure S-7 and Tables S-11 and S-12).

Figure 4 Scatter plot of observed 4-spot coefficients of variation
plotted
against the relative IGF1 quantities for run 1 (black dots, clean
source) and run 8 (gray diamonds, source containing excessive matrix
deposits). Individual plots for runs 1, 4, 8, and 12 are shown in
the Supporting Information in Figure S-6.

Conclusions
We
describe a MALDImmunoassay for quantification of IGF1 in human
plasma which complies with current international guidelines on quantitative
bioanalysis. The assay shows good correlation with the IDS-iSYS IGF1
immunoassay. However, a positive bias was observed for the IDS-iSYS
immunoassay as compared to the MALDImmunoassay, and the exact reasons
for this bias are still unknown.

MALDImmunoassays combine immunoaffinity
enrichment with MALDI-TOF
MS detection, and both these methodological features are known sources
of analytical variability. Consequently, the most critical feature
of a reliable quantitative assay is the application of an appropriate
internal standard which is capable of correcting for these sources
of analytical variability. A SIL version of the full-length analyte
is preferred for MALDImmunoassays, and therefore, 15N-IGF1
was used as internal standard in our IGF1 MALDImmunoassay. Another
critical step for an IGF1 assay is proper liberation of IGF1 from
its binding proteins which could interfere with the detection of IGF1.
We demonstrate in an IGFBP3 challenge experiment as well as in spike
recovery experiments that the SDS-based dissociation step is effectively
leading to dissociation of the IGF1/IGFBP complexes.

Application
of the MALDImmunoassay to a clinical study comprising
more than 1000 clinical samples indicated that contamination of the
MALDI source led to various degrees of oxidation of Met59. This variation in IGF1 oxidation was corrected for by the 15N-IGF1 internal standard emphasizing the need for a SIL internal
standard. Furthermore, variation in IGF1 oxidation as well as the
interspot variation were useful indicators of MALDI-TOF performance.
Therefore, we recommend to monitor these quality indicators in order
to ensure consistent performance of the assay.

In conclusion,
our work reports a validated MALDImmunoassay for
quantification of IGF1 in human plasma and addresses some of the challenges
of MALDImmunoassays that must be met in order to advance implementation
of this technology into routine clinical diagnostics.
