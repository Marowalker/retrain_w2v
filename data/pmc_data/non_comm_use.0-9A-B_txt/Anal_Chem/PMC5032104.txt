The development of antibodies to
low molecular weight haptens remains
challenging due to both the low immunogenicity of many haptens and
the cross-reactivity of the protein carriers used to generate the
immune response. Recombinant antibodies and novel display technologies
have greatly advanced antibody development; however, new techniques
are still required to select rare hapten-specific antibodies from
large recombinant libraries. In the present study, we used a combination
of phage and yeast display to screen an immune antibody library (size,
4.4 × 106) against hapten markers for petroleum contamination
(phenanthrene and methylphenanthrenes). Selection via phage display
was used first to enrich the library between 20- and 100-fold for
clones that bound to phenanthrene–protein conjugates. The enriched
libraries were subsequently transferred to a yeast display system
and a newly developed competitive FACS procedure was employed to select
rare hapten-specific clones. Competitive FACS increased the frequency
of hapten-specific scFvs in our yeast-displayed scFvs from 0.025 to
0.005% in the original library to between 13 and 35% in selected pools.
The presence of hapten-specific scFvs was confirmed by competitive
ELISA using periplasmic protein. Three distinct antibody clones that
recognize phenanthrene and methylphenanthrenes were selected, and
their distinctive binding properties were characterized. To our knowledge,
these are first antibodies that can distinguish between methylated
(petrogenic) versus unmethylated (pyrogenic) phenanthrenes; such antibodies
will be useful in detecting the sources of environmental contamination.
This selection method could be generally adopted in the selection
of other hapten-specific recombinant antibodies.

==== Body
Antibodies
to low molecular
weight haptens are invaluable tools for many analytical applications.
In drug analysis, competitive immunoassays are still the mainstay
in the screening and semiquantitative analysis of hundreds of different
xenobiotics and drugs of abuse.1 In addition,
fully automated, high-throughput antibody-based systems are available
in laboratories to help physicians to make timely decisions about
drug dosage and safe therapeutic levels.1,2 The demand
for diagnostic immunoassays to monitor the safe and effective use
of prescribed drugs will continue to increase as health care evolves
to more personalized interventions and to products tailored to the
individual patient.3 In addition to their
utility in clinical diagnostics, hapten-specific antibodies also play
an important role in environmental monitoring, where immunoassays
are most often used on-site to provide near real-time information
on the extent of environmental contamination or on the progress of
site remediation. Thus, antibodies directed toward low molecular weight
contaminants, including pesticides,4 PCBs,5 biotoxins,6 PAHs,7−9 and metals10−12 have proven useful to assess the safety of food,
water, and the ecosystem.

The generation of high-quality antibodies
for low molecular weight
haptens has never been straightforward. Antigens smaller than 1000
Da are usually not immunogenic, but can induce a T cell-dependent
immune response when conjugated to protein. Because these carrier
proteins are often more immunogenic than haptens alone, the antibodies
thus generated often have an extended binding sites that includes,
in addition to the hapten, portions of the protein used in conjugation.
Thus, most antihapten antibodies bind much more tightly to the hapten-protein
conjugates than to the soluble hapten, because of the greater number
of interactions at the binding site (for specific examples, see refs (13 and 14)). Antibodies with primary specificity
for soluble haptens are often very rare in the antibody repertoire
of immunized animals or from monoclonal antibodies prepared from immune
tissue.

Recombinant antibodies such as single-chain fragment
variable antibodies
(scFvs) have greatly advanced antibody development.15 Recombinant antibodies can be manipulated at molecular
level to modify their binding properties16,17 and they can be shuffled between different expression systems during
the selection and production processes.18 In addition, given the concerns about the reproducibility of many
published studies that utilize antibody-based reagents,19 new requirements for rigor in biomedical research
may ultimately demand that all antibodies be sequenced and expressed
as recombinant proteins.20 Antibody libraries
of high diversity can be created using recombinant technology,21 and the large numbers (106–1011) of distinct antibody clones from which to select theoretically
improves the chances of discovering rare clones, including hapten-specific
antibodies. When suitable selection procedures can be employed, even
antibodies present at very low frequency in the original library can
be highly enriched and become visible in the subpopulations.

In this study we describe a novel selection procedure for the identification
and subsequent isolation of rare, hapten-specific recombinant antibodies
from a relatively large immune library (∼4.4 × 106). We have developed a new, competitive fluorescence activated
cell sorting (FACS) protocol that, when combined with preselection
via phage and yeast display, yields high percentages (20–40%)
of hapten-specific scFvs in the final pool of selected cells, even
though no binding to soluble hapten could be detected using standard
selection strategies. In the present study, we used competitive FACS
to isolate antibody populations that could distinguish between methylated
and unmethylated phenanthrene, because antibodies for alkylated PAHs
can serve as markers for environmental petroleum contamination.22,23 However, this general method should be widely applicable to the
isolation of a wide variety of scFvs directed toward soluble antigens.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Chemicals (purities at 98% or higher) were
purchased from the following sources: phenanthrene (Phen, Sigma-Aldrich),
2-methylphenanthrene (2-MePhen, Sigma-Aldrich), 3-methylphenanthrene
(3-MePhen, BOC Sciences), 4-methylphenanthrene (4-MePhen, Chem Service),
9-methylphenanthrene (9-MePhen, Crescent Chemical). Each compound
was dissolved as 10 mM stock in DMSO. 9-Carboxyphenanthrene was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. 9-Carboxy-2-methylphenanthrene and 9-carboxy-2,7-dimethylphenanthrene
were synthesized in-house by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Core
Laboratory (NIEHS supported) at the University of Texas Medical Branch
in Galveston, TX. Phage display plasmid pComb3XSS was obtained from
The Scripps Research Institute. Both the yeast display plasmid pDNL6-GFP-myc
(originally generated from pPNL6 plasmid18,24) and scFv expression plasmid POE-myc (generated from a pET based
plasmid, pEP-D1.325) were modified in our
laboratory to replace the V5 tag with a myc tag. Monoclonal antimyc
antibody 9E10 was purified in-house from the culture supernatant of
9E10 hybridoma cells (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University
of Iowa).

Protein Conjugates, Mouse Immunization, and Immune Library Preparation
9-Carboxyphenanthrene, 9-carboxy-2-methyphenanthrene, and 9-carboxyl-2,7-dimethyphenanthrene)
were conjugated with protein carriers (either BSA or KLH) using a
mixed anhydride method.26 Details of conjugate
synthesis, purification and characterization are provided in Supporting Information. Immunization of mice
with these conjugates and the subsequent construction of an scFc immune
library are also available in Supporting Information.

Phage Selection
Antibody phage library or output pools
from previous rounds of selection were grown and infected with helper
phage M13KO7 for phage production as described in Supporting Information.

Two selection protocols were
performed toward two different targets (Phen or 2MePhen). A 96-well
high binding plate (Corning, NY) was coated with 50 μL of antigen
(5 μg/mL, either Phen-BSA or 2MePhen-BSA) at 4 °C overnight.
The next day, the plate was washed three times with PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA at 25
°C for 1 h. An aliquot of amplified phage (about 1012 cfu, see Supporting Information) was
also blocked with 3% BSA at 25 °C for 1 h in PBS or PBS plus
1% DMSO. The blocked phage were then added into the antigen-coated
plate, and incubated for 1 h. Unbound phage were removed by extensive
washing (15× with PBST followed by 2× with PBS) and the
bound phage were eluted by one of two methods: (1) Acid elution with
200 μL glycine·HCl at pH 2.2 for 8 min and immediate neutralization
with 2 M Tris to yield a final pH of ∼7.5. Early in the selection
process, this method ensures that selection is comprehensive and does
not exclude any rare binders; (2) Competitive elution with 100 μM
soluble analyte (either Phen or 2-MePhen) in 1% DMSO for 30 min. This
method was used in the final selection step to enrich a specific population
which preferentially recognized soluble analytes rather than protein
conjugates.

Half of the eluted phage were used to infect 10
mL log-phase OmniMAX
2 T1RE. coli (Invitrogen,
CA, U.S.A.) at 37 °C for 30 min. An aliquot of infected culture
was serially diluted and spread on 2xYT-AG plates to calculate the
number of phage eluted (as “output” of this round of
panning), and the rest of culture was incubated in fresh 2xYT-AG medium
overnight at 37 °C. The next day, phage particles were amplified
from this culture and used as “input” for next round
of panning.

Phage ELISA
Phage ELISA was performed
in 96-well high
binding plates (Corning, Corning, NY). Each well was coated with Phen-BSA
or 2MePhen-BSA (2 μg/mL) at 4 °C overnight and blocked
with 3% BSA in PBS. Phage pools recovered from each selection were
incubated in the antigen-coated well with solvent control (1% DMSO),
100 μM soluble hapten (Phen or 2-MePhen) or 50 μg/mL soluble
protein conjugate (Phen-BSA or 2MePhen-BSA). The binding of phage
particle to the immobilized antigens on the plate was measured using
anti-M13-HRP antibody (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.). The
HRP signal was detected by adding Sureblue TMB microwell peroxidase
substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) and the reaction was stopped after
5 min using 1 N HCl. All incubation steps were performed at room temperature
for an hour. The plate was washed three times with PBST between steps.

Yeast Display and Competitive FACS
After the final
phage selection, the phagemids containing the scFv genes were isolated
with a miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and scFv genes were amplified
with a pair of transfer primers (Table S2, Supporting Information). Yeast display plasmid pDNL6-GFP-myc was digested
with BssHII and NheI restriction enzymes and the linear plasmid was
gel-purified without the GFP insert. Digested pDNL6 plasmid (500 ng)
and purified scFv gene PCR product (1 μg) were transformed into
EBY100 yeast competent cells with Yeast Transformation
System 2 kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The homologous region
on the plasmid and PCR product flanking region led to the formation
of circular plasmids carrying scFv insert by the yeast homologous
repair mechanism.27,28

For flow cytometry using
a Beckham FACS Aria, the yeast library was incubated in growth medium
SD-CAA at 30 °C overnight for activation. The next day, activated
yeast cells were diluted in induction medium SG/R-CAA at OD600 = 0.5, and cultured again at 30 °C for 16 h. After induction,
107 induced yeast cells (OD600 = 0.5) were washed
twice with 0.5 mL wash buffer I (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and
2 mM EDTA), and once with 0.5 mL wash buffer II (PBS supplemented
with 0.5% BSA). Yeast cells were first incubated with 50 μL
competitor (200 μM Phen or 2-MePhen in PBS containing 1% DMSO)
for 30 min with rotation at 25 °C. An additional aliquot (50
μL) of biotinylated protein-conjugate (BSA-biotin, Phen-BSA-biotin,
or 2MePhen-BSA-biotin at concentrations between 60 and 200 nM) containing
2 μg/mL antimyc antibody 9E10 was then added and the cells were
incubated for another 30 min. Yeast cells were washed 3 times with
wash buffer II and stained with 4 μg/mL goat-antimouse-PE (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and 10 μg/mL streptavidin-Alexa633
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in the dark at 4 °C for
an hour. The stained yeast cells were washed three times with wash
buffer II and resuspended in 1 mL PBS for flow-cytometry analysis.
An identical procedure was used to stain pools after sorting by flow
cytometry. In each flow cytometry experiment, five controls were included
for compensation tests: (1) yeast cells without any primary and secondary
antibodies; (2) yeast cells with goat-antimouse-PE only; (3) yeast
cells with streptavidin-Alexa633 only; (4) yeast cells with 9E10 and
goat-antimouse-PE; (5) yeast cells with biotinylated protein-conjugate
and streptavidin-Alexa633.

Monoclonal Analysis
The yeast cells
collected from
the final FACS sort were serially diluted and spread onto SD-CAA agar
plate in 30 °C incubator to form single colonies. After 2–3
days, individual colonies from the plate were selected, inoculated
into 0.5 mL of SD-CAA medium in a 96 deep-well plates, and incubated
at 30 °C overnight. On the second day, a 50 μL aliquot
of the culture was transferred into 500 μL SG/R-CAA medium and
induced overnight at 30 °C. An aliquot (50 μL) of the induced
monoclonal yeast cells was subsequently transferred into a 96-well
vacuum filter plate, and washed twice with 150 μL wash buffer
I and once with 150 μL wash buffer II. The cells were stained
as described above and suspended in 200 μL PBS for FACS analysis
using a Guava easyCyte Flow cytometer (EMD Millipore, Billerica MA).

Soluble scFv Expression and Purification
Flow-cytometry-positive
scFvs were cloned into expression vector POE-myc. Details of cloning,
bacterial transformation, and induction are available in Supporting Information. Soluble scFv from periplasmic
extract was purified using HisPur Cobalt Resin (Life Technology, Grand
Island, NY). The periplasmic extract (40 mL) was first incubated with
1 mL resin for an hour with rotation, and then the resin was gravity-packed
in a column (1 × 1 cm). The resin column was washed with equilibration
buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM imidazole,
PH 7.4) until the A280 of flow through
reached a baseline. The scFv was subsequently eluted with 50 mM sodium
phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 150 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. A few
fractions (1 mL each) of eluate were collected to ensure all protein
had been eluted, then those fractions with protein were pooled and
concentrated using an Amicon ultra-15 device (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA). The purified scFv was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the protein concentration
was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Binding Characterization of Soluble scFvs
Competitive
ELISA was performed in 96-well high binding plates (Corning, Corning,
NY). Each well was coated with 2 μg/mL antigen at 4 °C
overnight and blocked with 3% BSA. Antibody scFv (A10, 5.32 μg/mL;
D7, 8.76 μg/mL; G8, 3.81 μg/mL) was incubated in the antigen-coated
well with or without soluble competitor, and the binding of scFv was
accessed using antimyc antibody (9E10) and goat-antimouse-HPR antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO). The HRP signal was detected as described for Phage ELISA, above. All incubation steps were
performed at room temperature for an hour. The plate was washed three
times with PBST between steps.

Results and Discussion
In preliminary studies, we attempted to select antibodies against
methylphenathrenes from a naïve library with a diversity of
approximately 3 × 1011.21 However, the scFvs selected from this library recognized Phen-protein
conjugates, but not soluble Phen (data not shown). We therefore prepared
an immune phage display library for selection of antibodies that could
recognize soluble phenanthrenes. Antibodies selected from immune libraries
generally have higher specificity and affinity than those selected
from naïve libraries.29,30 After immunization,
serum antibodies to Phen-BSA conjugates were confirmed by indirect
ELISA (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Mice were sacrificed 7 days after the final injection and splenic
tissue was used as the starting material for cDNA synthesis. DNA sequences
coding for antibody variable domains from heavy chains (VH) and light
chains (VL) were amplified using a pool of degenerate primers.31 These primers were adapted to our display system
as shown in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information). The flanking regions
of VH-reverse primers and VL-forward primers contain the same flexible
linker sequence, and were used as complementary regions in a second
overlap extension PCR step to form a full-length scFv fragment. The
final DNA fragments encoded scFv products that had a VH-linker-VL
structure, with a total length of ∼800bp. After gel purification
and restriction endonuclease digestion, the 800bp PCR fragments were
inserted into the pComb3 plasmid. The differences between two 5′-overhang
sequences in the SfiI digested fragments ensured
that the DNA fragments were inserted in the correct orientation. Phagemids
bearing DNA fragments that encoded these scFvs were transformed into
SS320 E. coli cells by electroporation
to provide maximal transformation efficiency. The size of this immune
library was 6.2 × 106. Clones with DNA fragments encoding
full-length scFvs (∼800bp) comprised 87.5% of the sequences,
and 81.25% of clones had distinct sequences, as confirmed by BstNI fingerprint analysis (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The final library size was calculated
to be 4.41 × 106.

Because the library contained
∼4.4 million distinct scFv
sequences, sophisticated selection strategies were required to identify
the clones that expressed the rare antibodies that recognize soluble
hapten (Phen and/or MePhen) in this large pool. We therefore employed
a combination of phage and yeast display selections to identify the
rare clones that expressed scFvs with the ability to bind these soluble
haptens, as shown in Figure 1. Phage display is useful for exploring a relatively large
library and permits rapid removal of undesirable scFvs from the library.
However, the output of selection always contains a relatively high
level of nonspecific binders due to the intrinsic “stickiness”
of phage particles. Preliminary experiments had indicated that sequences
encoding antihapten antibodies were present at very low frequency
in the library; thus any nonspecific background noise could overwhelm
the true binding signals and make it very difficult to detect antihapten
antibodies using competitive phage ELISA.32,33 The yeast display system is limited to smaller scFv libraries, but
this display system can be coupled with Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS) to provide very strict controls over selection parameters.34,35 Initial selection of our library using phage display excluded undesirable
scFvs and reduced the overall size of the library. Subsequent yeast
display allowed us to further analyze the output pool and sort for
expressed scFvs that not only bound to the hapten-BSA-conjugates but
also recognized soluble Phen and/or MePhen haptens.

developing recombinant antibodies against
unsubstituted and methylphenanthrenes. (A) Immune library construction.
(B) Phage display selection. Phage panning (3 rounds) was performed
and final output pools were transferred into the yeast display plasmid
(steps 6 and 7). (C) Yeast display analysis. The expression of scFv
was measured by an antimyc antibody-phycoerythrine-labeled antimouse
antibody (X axis signal). The binding of the scFv
to the biotinylated phenanthrene-protein conjugate was measured by
streptavidin-Alexa633 fluorescence (Y axis signal).

Phage Selection
Preliminary studies
showed that the
number of panning steps had to be limited in order to efficiently
select specific binders while maintaining the diversity of output
pools. Multiple rounds of selection not only selected for the antibodies
that bound with highest affinity, but also allowed clones with the
highest growth rates to predominant during subsequent bacterial amplification.36 In addition, when selecting for hapten-specific
antibodies, high affinity to hapten-protein conjugates does not necessarily
translate to high affinity to soluble hapten.13 In preliminary studies, a seven-step selection process led to the
selection of a single scFv that bound to the Phen-BSA conjugate with
high affinity (KD = 10 nM) but did not
recognize soluble Phen or MePhen (data not shown). We therefore adjusted
our selection protocol as shown in Table 1. Total of three rounds of panning were performed
against two different capture antigens, Phen-BSA (Protocol 1) or 2MePhen-BSA
(Protocol 2). Each panning step was designed to provide a specific
selective pressure. The first round enriched for phage that bound
to the hapten-protein conjugate; the second panning step introduced
a solvent condition (1% DMSO) to exclude antibodies that were unstable
in this solvent and, hence, would not be useful when soluble haptens
were applied later in the selection process. In the final round of
panning, soluble hapten was added to elute the pool of binders that
preferentially bound to soluble hapten. The input-to-output ratio
(yield) was used to determine enrichment at each selection step. The
last round of panning enriched our populations by 20- and 108-fold,
respectively, for Protocols 1 and 2. We confirmed that phage from
round 3 bound soluble Phen-BSA and/or 2MePhen-BSA using by competitive
phage ELISA, as shown in Figure 2; however, we were not able to detect any inhibition
by soluble Phen or 2MePhen in these pooled phage populations.

Figure 2 Competitive
phage ELISA. Phage were tested for binding to immobilized
Phen-BSA (Phen) or 2MePhen-BSA (MePhen) in the presence of DMSO, soluble
phenanthrenes in DMSO or soluble phenanthrene-protein conjugates (0.75
μM).

Yeast Display, Preliminary FACS Selection,
and Competitive FACS
The sequences that encoded the scFv
fragments from round 3 phage
(Table 1) were amplified,
transferred into the yeast display plasmid, and transformed into two
independent yeast pools. The transformed yeast cells were induced
to activate the expression of cell surface Aga2p-scFv-myc fusion proteins
and the scFv-bearing yeast cells were stained with two fluorescent
dyes and analyzed by flow-cytometry (see schematic in Figure 3A). The expression level of
scFv was monitored by the signal from the myc tag and is shown on
the X axis of the flow plot, while the binding capacity
of expressed scFv to hapten-conjugates was detected by the signal
from the biotinylated antigen and is shown on the Y axis of flow plot. The strategy for competitive FACS is shown in Figure 3. The yeast cell
population that both expressed scFv (as assessed by the signal on
the X axis) and bound to the biotinylated Phen-BSA
conjugate (as assessed by the Y axis signal) is incubated
in the presence of soluble hapten (either Phen or 2MePhen). Those
clones that bind to soluble antigen will show lower signals in the Y axis and would be enriched in the area of the Q2 quadrant
circled in Figure 3D.

Figure 3 Strategy for selection by competitive FACS. The yeast cell population
that both expresses scFv (the X axis the signal)
and binds to the biotinylated Phen-BSA conjugate (the Y axis signal) is incubated in the presence of soluble hapten (either
Phen or 2MePhen). Those clones that bind to soluble antigen will show
lower signals in the Y axis and will be enriched
in the area of the Q2 quadrant circled in Figure 3D.

We first explored the yeast population derived from phage
selected
via Protocol 1. Selection of yeast cells that expressed hapten-specific
antibodies involved two rounds of sorting. The first round removed
cell populations that could cause interference during subsequent selection
steps. As shown in Figure 4A, when yeast cells derived from the Protocol 1 selection
were stained with antimyc antibody and BSA conjugated with biotin
but not Phen (a negative control in the FACS assay), a significant
number of cells migrated in the Q2 quadrant. These biotin-binding
cells in Q2 quadrant would interfere with the competitive sorting
planned for subsequent selections. We removed these biotin-binding
clones by collecting only the cells in Q4, in order to exclude nonspecific
binders (see boxed area in Figure 4A). These negatively sorted cells, when re-examined
for their binding to BSA-biotin, now showed a much smaller population
of cells in the Q2 quadrant (data not shown). A competitive cell sort
was then performed, according to the strategy shown in Figure 3. Yeast pools from the negatively
sorted cells were divided into two groups and incubated with either
2% DMSO (Figure 4B)
or soluble competitor (200 μM Phen in 2% DMSO) in the presence
of 30 nM biotin-labeled Phen-BSA (Figure 4C). Because the cell population was split
after induction of cell surface scFvs, there was no change in the
expression level of scFv fragments and the X axis
signal should remain the same for the two groups. However, those cell-surface
antibodies that recognized soluble hapten would be competitively inhibited
from binding to the biotinylated hapten–protein conjugate,
and cells carrying antibodies with these binding characteristics should
show a decreased signal on the Y axis of the flow
plot. Thus, by selecting the cell population that shifted down in
the presence of soluble competitor (Figure 4C, red circle), we were able to enrich for
those rare surface-displayed antibodies that were specifically inhibited
by the soluble haptens. The total cells selected in this gate was
∼0.6% of the total cells in the absence of soluble hapten (yellow
circle, Figure 4B)
and ∼1% of cells in the presence of soluble hapten (red circle, Figure 4C). Thus, we hypothesized
that ∼40% of the yeast clones in this very small population
should contain antibodies that would recognize soluble hapten.

Figure 4 FACS of the
yeast cells derived from Protocol 1. (A) Cells showed
significant background signal when incubated with biotin-BSA (see
Q2). Clones outlined in red were carried forward for subsequent selections.
(B) Yeast cells from A were incubated with biotin-BSA-Phen. (C) Yeast
cells from A were incubated with biotin-BSA-Phen +200 μM soluble
Phen. Cells in the red circle were collected for further analysis.

When we examined the yeast cells
derived from Protocol 2, the first
FACS analysis (as shown in Figure 5A) looked very different from what was observed with
Protocol 1 cells. The Q2 quadrant of Pool 2 was relatively clean in
the presence of BSA-Biotin (Figure 5A), so a negative sort was not required. However, relatively
few cells in this population bound to the antigen (biotin-labeled
2MePhen-BSA) and the scattered populations in Q2 and Q4 would overwhelm
the small population that might be inhibited by soluble hapten in
the subsequent competitive FACS selection. Therefore, the cells derived
from Protocol 2 were first selected for those clones that bound tightly
to the biotin labeled 2-MePhen-BSA, as shown in P5 gate of Figure 5B. After this selection,
a competitive FACS strategy was employed. In this competitive selection,
200 μM soluble 2MePhen was used as the soluble competitor and
10 nM biotinylated 2MePhen-BSA was used as the protein conjugate.
In the absence of soluble hapten, the cells selected in P4 gate comprised
∼0.7% of total cells (Figure 5C); cells in this gate population increased to ∼1%
when soluble hapten was added (Figure 5D). Similarly to Pool 1, these results suggest that
roughly 30% yeast clones from this population may recognize the soluble
hapten.

High affinity binders from this pool were selected as outlined in

Competitive FACS of Monoclonal
Yeast Cells, Sequence Analysis,
and Competitive ELISA of Periplasmic Extracts
Single clones
were induced individually from the cells collected in the gates shown
in Figure 4C and 5D. We picked 184 individual clones from cells gated
as shown in Figure 4C and analyzed their binding to biotinylated Phen-BSA in the presence
of soluble Phen or 2MePhen. When we performed competitive FACS on
yeast cell populations derived from these individual clones, the presence
of soluble inhibitor (either Phen or 2MePhen) caused a downward shift
in the Y axis signal in 70 of the 184 clones (∼38%).
FACS of three representative clones (D7, G8, and A10) is shown in Figure 6. The presence of
200 μM Phen or 2MePhen caused a similar downward shift of the
signal on the Y axis when Clones D7 and G8 were analyzed
by competitive FACS; thus, these two clones did not seem to be able
to distinguish between the Phen and 2MePhen. However, when clone A10
was analyzed, it appeared to show some preference for 2MePhen, since
this competitor caused a larger downward shift of the Y axis signal. All 70 of the clones identified via monoclonal FACS
were subsequently cloned into an expression vector to produce soluble
scFv protein, and the crude periplasmic extracts were used to confirm
binding of scFv to soluble hapten by competitive ELISA without the
avidity or other interferences that might arise from the yeast display
system. Of the 70 clones identified by competitive flow cytometry,
65 also showed activity in the competitive ELISA format. When these
65 clones were sequenced, 7 distinct scFv sequences were found. Such
duplication is to be expected in immune libraries, where significant
in vivo selection has already occurred. The fact that we have independently
isolated duplicate clones with similar binding properties demonstrates
the selectivity of the method.

Figure 6 Monoclonal FACS of three representative
clones is shown in three
columns. (Top) Cells were incubated with biotin-labeled Phen-BSA in
buffer+2% DMSO (solvent control); (Middle) Cells were incubated with
biotin labeled Phen-BSA plus 200 μM phenanthrene in buffer +
2% DMSO; (Bottom) Cells incubated with biotin labeled Phen-BSA plus
200 μM 2-methyl-phenanthrene in buffer + 2%DMSO.

Similar selection protocols were applied to cells
derived from
Protocol 2, where analysis of 48 individual clones revealed 8 clones
that were positive by competitive flow cytometry, 6 that were positive
by competitive ELISA, and 3 distinct scFvs with different binding
properties. These data are summarized in Table 2. Sequence alignment (see Figure S3 in Supporting Information) indicated that all positive clones appeared to fall into three
family lines, related to the A10, D7, and G8 clones that showed distinct
patterns during competitive flow cytometry.

Finally, we explored
the binding characteristics of the scFvs expressed by these three
clones, as models of the antibodies present in the immune library.
Purified scFvs were analyzed by competitive ELISA for their abilities
to recognize unsubstituted Phen or MePhens, as shown in Figure 7. Clone D7 bound to all Phen
analogues with no significant difference, while G8 and A10 were able
to differentiate among various methylated phenanthrenes. G8 scFv bound
to 4MePhen most tightly, and A10 preferred 2MePhen over other isomers.
The position of methyl substituents is shown in the structure above
the graphs.

Conclusions
In
this study, we demonstrate that the FACS selections described
herein provide a powerful new tool for the isolation of rare hapten-specific
scFvs Two FACS procedures were required after transfer of the phage-selected
library to the yeast display system. The first selection either removed
clones that bound nonspecifically to our antigen (Protocol 1) or enriched
the library for those clones that bound efficiently to our protein
antigen (Protocol 2). In both cases, ∼50% of the total phage-selected
clones were eliminated. The second, competitive FACS allowed us to
isolate a very small pool of clones (∼1% of total sorted cells)
that were highly enriched (13–35%) in clones that bound to
soluble hapten. Thus, after the two FACS selections, sequence analysis
and competitive ELISA of periplasmic extracts could be limited to
∼0.5% of the original phage-selected population. When combined
with the 20–100-fold enrichment achieved during the panning
steps, these methods increased the chances of finding hapten-specific
scFvs in from 0.025 to 0.005% in the original immune library to 13–35%
in the final selected pool. Such enrichment will greatly reduce the
workload of investigators who wish to utilize recombinant technology
to generate hapten-specific antibodies, and hopefully will increase
the total hapten-specific scFvs available to the general public in
the future.

Experiments are currently in progress to further
study the binding
properties of the 10 distinct PAH-specific scFvs isolated in these
experiments and to utilize these unique reagents in new sensors to
distinguish the sources of environmental PAH contamination. These
antibodies could also be used to evaluate the relative toxicity of
PAH mixtures from oil spills since increases in the relative proportions
of methylated PAHs in such mixtures are likely to increase the activation
of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor37 and thus lead to increases in reactive oxygen species and protein-
and DNA-PAH adducts.
