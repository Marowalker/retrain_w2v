A customized metabolomics NMR database,
termed 1H(13C)-TOCCATA, is introduced, which
contains complete 1H and 13C chemical shift
information on individual spin
systems and isomeric states of common metabolites. Since this information
directly corresponds to cross sections of 2D 1H–1H TOCSY and 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY
spectra, it allows the straightforward and unambiguous identification
of metabolites of complex metabolic mixtures at 13C natural
abundance from these types of experiments. The 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database, which is complementary to the previously
introduced TOCCATA database for the analysis of uniformly 13C-labeled compounds, currently contains 455 metabolites, and it can
be used through a publicly accessible web portal. We demonstrate its
performance by applying it to 2D 1H–1H TOCSY and 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra
of a cell lysate from E. coli, which
yields a substantial improvement over other databases, as well as
1D NMR-based approaches, in the number of compounds that can be correctly
identified with high confidence.

==== Body
Over the
past decade, NMR spectroscopy
has become one of two main analytical techniques for metabolomics
studies in the absence of extensive compound extraction and physical
separation.1,2 The high-resolution information offered
by NMR is the key for the identification and quantification of metabolites,
which is the primary goal of most metabolomics studies.3 The retrieval of such information from one-dimensional
(1D) NMR spectra of complex real-life mixtures can be very challenging
because of the high frequency of overlapping resonances that belong
to different compounds.4 Moreover, the
lack of connectivity information on spins belonging to the same compound
limits the combined use of multiple resonances as unique compound
fingerprints.5 The availability of such
connectivity information provides significant advantages for the identification
and quantification of metabolites.6,7 Specifically,
simultaneous searching of multiple peaks of a metabolite against a
NMR database substantially improves the uniqueness and accuracy of
the hits.8 For uncatalogued metabolites,
connectivities provide information about chemical bonds and an opportunity
for de novo elucidation of the backbone topology
and the structure of metabolites.9 Once
the connectivities are known, the accuracy of metabolite quantitation
can be enhanced through coanalysis of multiple peaks of a given metabolite.10,11 Finally, connectivities can be used effectively for the deconvolution
of complex mixtures using multidimensional NMR experiments.12

Although the use of multidimensional NMR
experiments requires longer
measurement times, it can overcome many of the limitations of 1D NMR.13 In a 2D NMR spectrum, cross-peaks belonging
to spins whose resonances overlap in a 1D NMR spectrum are spread
out along the indirect dimension thereby reducing the likelihood of
peak overlap. A 2D 13C–1H HSQC spectrum,14 for example, provides excellent spectral dispersion
along the indirect 13C dimension and allows the separation
of many of the peaks that overlap in a 1D 1H NMR spectrum.
Several NMR metabolomics databases and queries permit identification
of peaks of 2D 13C–1H HSQC spectra.15−18 They all accept a list of the cross-peaks observed in the 2D 13C–1H HSQC spectrum of the mixture and perform
a cross-peak by cross-peak match against the database entries. Although
the introduction of the indirect 13C dimension increases
the resolution in this approach, the lack of connectivity information
between different 1H, 13C pairs belonging to
the same molecule can cause ambiguities for peak annotation and metabolite
identification analogous to 1D NMR.

Connectivity information
between different resonances of a molecule
is available in TOCSY spectra collected at long mixing times.19 Since TOCSY traces only correlate resonances
with each other that belong to the same spin system, for molecules
that have multiple spin systems or exist in multiple slowly interconverting
isomeric forms, these traces represent only part of the entire 1D
NMR spectrum. Therefore, their query against a NMR database consisting
of entire 1D NMR spectra of metabolites leads to imperfect matches,
carrying the risk of false interpretations.20 Because public NMR databases so far do not sort spins into individual
spin systems or multiple slowly exchanging isomers for separate queries,
we recently introduced a customized metabolite database, termed TOCCATA.20 This database is specifically geared toward
the query of 13C TOCSY traces extracted from TOCSY experiments
that directly employ magnetization transfer between 13C
spins without the involvement of their attached protons. These experiments
are 13C–13C CT-TOCSY,2113C–13C TOCSY,19 and even 13C–13C COSY22 after the user has established
complete chemical shift lists of each spin system from a “COSY-walk”
along directly coupled 13C spins. TOCCATA uses 13C chemical shift information for the reliable identification of metabolites,
their isomeric states and spin systems. For a fully 13C
labeled E. coli cell extract, querying
with TOCCATA provided more than 30% improvement in matching accuracy
over existing 1D 13C NMR web servers.20

TOCCATA can be generally used for metabolomics analysis
of uniformly 13C labeled organisms such as bacteria, yeast, C. elegans, and plants. For more complex organisms,
including humans, for which 13C labeling is not feasible, 1H-TOCSY-type experiments can be used instead, in particular
2D 1H–1H TOCSY and 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY.23 Here, we present
a customized database for these types of experiments, which transfer
magnetization by TOCSY via the 1H spins. In order to clearly
distinguish between the new and the original TOCCATA database, we
call the new database “1H(13C)-TOCCATA,”
while we refer to the original database as “13C-TOCCATA.”

The new 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database stores the
information content of TOCSY traces in the form of individual spin
systems and/or multiple slowly exchanging isomers for separate queries.
It therefore allows the querying of 1H TOCSY traces from
2D 1H–1H TOCSY spectra as well as the
querying of 1H HSQC-TOCSY traces (rows) and 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces (columns) from 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra. The performance of the new database
is demonstrated for an E. coli cell
lysate, which resulted in the accurate identification of over 50 metabolites
from a single sample.

Results and Discussion
Generation of 1H(13C)-TOCCATA Database
The new 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database was derived
primarily from the BMRB15 and HMDB17 metabolomics databases and it presently contains
455 compounds. From these 455 compounds, 219 contain a single spin
system and adopt a single isomeric state, 199 compounds consist of
more than one spin system in a single (isomeric) state, 24 compounds
consist of a single spin system in multiple isomeric states, and 13
compounds consist of multiple states and multiple spin systems (Table S-1). This means that TOCSY traces of more
than half of the metabolites in the new database, namely 236, cannot
be matched with databases derived from 1D NMR data.

The new
database is organized as follows. First, all 455 compounds were subdivided
into their isomeric states, which were then further subdivided into
individual spin systems. Each 1H chemical shift is stored
together with the chemical shift of its directly attached 13C. This allows the extraction of complete 1D 1H TOCSY,
1D 1H HSQC-TOCSY, and 1D 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces
for each spin system or isomeric state. 1D 1H TOCSY traces
are used for the query of a 2D 1H–1H
TOCSY spectrum, whereas 1D 1H and 13C HSQC-TOCSY
traces are used to query cross sections along the direct and indirect
dimensions of a 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY
spectrum, respectively. It should be noted that in the absence of
overlaps, the information content about a spin system in a 1D 1H TOCSY trace and a 1D 1H HSQC-TOCSY trace are
the same.

1D 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces from 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY and 1D 13C TOCSY traces
from 2D 13C–13C CT-TOCSY spectra are
not necessarily
the same, because in 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY,
the TOCSY-magnetization transfer is mediated by the 1H
spins, whereas in 2D 13C–13C CT-TOCSY,
the TOCSY magnetization is mediated by the 13C spins. This
leads to distinct spectral differences for metabolites with nonprotonated
carbons. Nonprotonated carbons are not displayed in 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra, but they appear in 2D 13C–13C CT-TOCSY spectra.9 Furthermore,
a nonprotonated carbon may break up a molecule into two separate 13C traces in 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY
spectra, but not in 2D 13C–13C CT-TOCSY
spectra. Hence, 1D 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces from 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra cannot always be identified
using our previous 13C-TOCCATA database20 with optimal accuracy, which explains the need to include 13C traces in the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database.
A comparison of the performance of 1H(13C)-TOCCATA
and 13C-TOCCATA databases for the analysis of 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra is provided in the section
“Application of 1H(13C)-TOCCATA to E. coli Cell
Lysate” (see below).

In our previous 13C-TOCCATA
work, we used the fact that 1J(13C–13C) couplings
are generally much larger than 2J(13C–13C) and 3J(13C–13C) couplings. Therefore, we divided
a molecule into two (or more) spin systems when two carbons are separated
by at least one noncarbon atom.20 For protons,
this step requires modification, because neighboring protons that
are still part of the same spin system are at least by two and three
bonds apart. Hence, the spin system definition for protons is based
on a contiguous spin network of 2J(1H–1H) and 3J(1H–1H) couplings. We observed that
for most metabolites this rule agrees well with the cross-peak patterns
of experimental 2D 1H–1H TOCSY spectra
collected at a mixing time of ∼60–90 ms. However, there
are some exceptions, such as in ring fragments of some of the metabolites,
where four bond 4J(1H–1H) couplings can be quite strong,24 which creates additional cross-peaks in the 1H TOCSY
spectra. Nicotinic acid is one of these exceptions, as is demonstrated
in the Supporting Information Figure S-1:
protons located in the structure of nicotinic acid at positions 4,
5, and 6 in Figure S-1A theoretically belong
to the same spin system, while the proton located at position 3 (Figure S-1A) constitutes a separate spin system.
However, the 1H–1H TOCSY spectrum of
nicotinic acid taken from the BMRB (Figure S-1D) shows that protons located at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 all belong
to a single spin system. Therefore, the experimental verification
of each 1H TOCSY spin system was required when assembling
this customized database. For all 455 metabolites (Table S-1), spin system identification was based on the manual
inspection of their 2D 1H–1H TOCSY spectra
in the BMRB and HMDB. This definition of spin systems yielded a total
of 846 different spin systems. A specifically designed web portal
at http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/toccata2/index allows querying of the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database
either using a 1H or 13C chemical shift list
of a given spin system extracted from 1H–1H TOCSY and/or 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra.

matching at the example of E. coli cell
lysate using the Chenomx NMR software. Overlay of 1D 1H
NMR spectra of metabolites from the Chenomx database (blue) on 1D 1H NMR spectrum of E. coli cell
lysate (black). Putrescine (A) and alanine (B) possess at least one
(partially) isolated peak in the lysate spectrum that matches a peak
in the corresponding database spectrum. On the other hand, each of
the peaks of lysine (C) and uridine (D) overlap with other peaks in
the lysate spectrum, which makes their unambiguous identification
impossible.

The chemical shift assignments
of all compounds in the new database
were done manually by the extraction of spectral information from
BMRB, HMDB, and the literature. Only NMR data of compounds dissolved
in H2O/D2O at pH 7.0 or 7.4 were included in
the new database. The new web server shares many of its querying features
with the 13C-TOCCATA database. For instance, it allows
users to specify the spectral range on which the database query should
be performed by entering the most downfield and most upfield frequencies
in parts per million (ppm). This feature can be used to eliminate
potential mismatches arising from far off-resonance nuclei not detected
in the TOCSY or HSQC-TOCSY experiment, but which are present in the
database. Ideally, the number of query peaks is identical to the number
of resonances of the best matching spin system. However, this is not
always the case, because, e.g., a peak was missing in the query trace
or because two multiplet components of the same resonance were assigned
to two different chemical shifts. To facilitate the analysis of mismatches,
the web server allows the user to specify a maximally tolerable mismatch Mmax, which is the absolute value of the difference
between the number of query peaks and the number of resonances of
the spin system in the database. If the user is confident that all
query peaks were correctly identified, then a mismatch parameter Mmax = 0 should be entered (default value). The
origin of a mismatch larger than zero should always be traced back
in the original spectrum to prevent false identifications.

An
important prerequisite for the querying of NMR chemical shifts
is that they are properly referenced. Ideally, the chemical shifts
are referenced against standard compounds, such as 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic
acid (DSS) or tetramethylsilane (TMS). In the case that no standard
was used, the web server permits the user to enter a chemical shift
offset value (“Reference correction,” default 0.00 ppm)
in order to reference a spectrum by uniformly increasing or decreasing
the chemical shifts of all metabolite signals in the spectrum by the
entered chemical shift offset. To find the minimum root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) for every metabolite, the matching algorithm performs
an automated alignment with a tolerance of ±0.2 ppm for 1H and ±0.6 ppm for 13C before applying a weighted
matching algorithm25 to find the best matching
peak pairs from the query list and the database. Finally, the average
chemical shift RMSD between input and database peak pairs is computed
and used as a criterion for the identification of the best match,
which will be then be returned to the user.

In our experience,
the database query is most accurate when Mmax = 0 and RMSD < 0.02 ppm for 1H and <0.2 ppm for 13C (default values). If none of
the database entries satisfies the above criteria, the query returns
“no match.” When multiple matches are returned, they
are rank-ordered according to increasing RMSDs. Concise information
about the number of isomeric states and spin systems of a compound
is displayed for the top four returns.

Limitation of 1D 1H NMR Approaches for Metabolite
Identification in E. coli
The standard 1D 1H NMR approach for metabolite identification
relies on overlaying a 1D 1H NMR spectra of pure metabolites
one by one with the experimental 1D 1H NMR mixture spectrum,
which is implemented, for example, in the Chenomx NMR Suite software
(Edmonton, AB, Canada), which is one of the most commonly used commercial
software packages in the field. We acquired a 1D 1H NMR
spectrum of E. coli cell lysate and
tested the 1D 1H NMR approach by using the Chenomx software,
which resulted in the observation of NMR peaks of 19 metabolites (Table S-2). However, for the majority of these
metabolites, the identification was ambiguous, because of the strong
peak overlaps in the 1D 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S-2), which resulted in the successful matching of
only a subset of the peaks of a metabolite. For instance out of the
19 metabolites, 13 have multiple 1H signals, but only for
putrescine and uracil all 1H signals can be unambiguously
observed in the spectrum (Table S-2). The
other 6 metabolites each possess a single 1H resonance,
and single peak matching does not provide very high confidence unless
the chemical shift position is unique such as is the case for fumarate.
Overall, 19 metabolites represent only a small subset of the total
number of metabolites in this same sample that could be unambiguously
identified. Another problem we observed was the occurrence of numerous
false positive identifications, which is consistent with observations
reported by others.8 Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure
S-3 demonstrate the clear limitations of 1D 1H NMR for
metabolite identification, at least for a spectrum of the complexity
of the E. coli cell lysate. Putrescine,
uracil, and fumarate can be identified with high confidence in the
1D 1H NMR spectrum. Alanine, valine, and nicotinic acid
identifications are ambiguous, since not all of their peaks yield
a good match. And finally, certain metabolites, such as lysine, uridine,
malate, and ethanol, whose existence in the sample was verified by
the use of multidimensional NMR spectra, could not be identified on
the basis of 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy alone (Figure 1 and Figure S-3).

Application
of 1H(13C)-TOCCATA to E. coli Cell Lysate
2D 1H–1H TOCSY
The 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database was first applied
to the 1H–1H TOCSY spectrum of E.
coli cell lysate (Figure S-4). A total of 45 1H TOCSY traces were extracted and identified
in the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database with the query
results listed in Table 1. For 27 1H TOCSY traces, the query returned the correct compound as a single
best hit. For the other 18 traces, on average 2.6 hits were returned
with the top (i.e., best) hit always being the correct one. These
45 traces belong to 41 distinct metabolites. The TOCSY cross-peaks
of these metabolites are shown by superimposing a 1H–1H TOCSY spectrum reconstructed from the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database onto the experimental spectrum (Figure 2A). For comparison, Figure 2B shows the TOCSY spectrum reconstructed from entire 1D 1H NMR spectra. Since the 1D 1H NMR spectra do not discriminate
between different spin systems or isomeric states, the reconstructed
spectrum generates cross-peaks between all peaks of a metabolite,
which leads to a large number of false positive cross-peaks (Figure 2B). For the same reason the querying of TOCSY traces
against 1D NMR databases leads to a large number of mismatches. To
compare the querying results using 1H(13C)-TOCCATA
with 1D 1H NMR databases, we submitted the 45 1H TOCSY traces to the BMRB,15 MMCD,16 COLMAR,25 and HMDB17 databases for 1D 1H NMR querying.
They identified 17, 20, 29, and 13 1H TOCSY traces correctly
as first hit, respectively. The detailed performance of each of these
databases for all 1H TOCSY traces can be found in Supporting Information Table S-3. In general,
metabolites that exist as a single isomer and have a single spin system
(e.g., valine, isoleucine, nicotinic acid etc.) were identified correctly
by both 1D 1H NMR databases and the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database. However, metabolites existing in multiple
isomeric states and/or in multiple spin systems, including tyrosine,
NADP+, coenzyme A, and adenosine, were almost always correctly
identified only by the new database, 1H(13C)-TOCCATA.
Overall, the new database provides ∼35% improvement over the
best performing 1D 1H NMR query.

The MMCD,16 HMDB,17 and Metabominer8 databases
are,
at least in part, derived from 1H–1H
TOCSY experiments. The major difference between these databases and 1H(13C)-TOCCATA is the database organization for
the TOCSY peaks of each metabolite. In the MMCD, HMDB, and Metabominer
databases, the 2D 1H–1H TOCSY spectrum
of each isolated metabolite is stored as a single entry. Therefore,
each database entry consists of all TOCSY peaks of a metabolite. By
contrast, in 1H(13C)-TOCCATA each such entry
is subdivided into a molecule’s isomeric states and spin systems.
This is because the TOCSY spectrum only displays correlations (connectivities)
between spins in the same spin system, but not between spins belonging
to different spin systems or resonances belonging to different isomeric
states. Therefore, for such molecules the query of individual TOCSY
traces against these databases will cause mismatches.

We queried
the 45 1H TOCSY traces of the E. coli cell lysate against the 2D 1H–1H TOCSY
databases of MMCD, HMDB, and Metabominer. They correctly
identified only 20, 20, and 24 1H TOCSY traces as first
hits, respectively, which illustrates the benefits of 1H(13C)-TOCCATA. The detailed performance of each database
for all 1H TOCSY traces is given in Supporting Information Table S-4.

2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY
The
second application of the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database
was performed using a 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY
spectrum of E. coli cell lysate (Figure S-5). A total of 38 13C and 1H HSQC-TOCSY trace pairs were extracted from the spectrum.
For each pair, the 1H chemical shift list was queried against
the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database (using a 0.02 ppm
RMSD cutoff and Mmax = 0) independently
of the querying of the 13C chemical shift list (using a
0.2 ppm RMSD cutoff and Mmax = 0). Figures 3 and S-6 each represent
a screenshot of the query result of the web server of one of these
trace pairs using the new database. In Figure 3, querying of the peak list of a 1H HSQC-TOCSY trace (row)
extracted from a 2D HSQC-TOCSY spectrum results in a single hit, corresponding
to the ribose ring of inosine. When on the same web page, the box
for “13C HSQC-TOCSY Query” is selected, the
default values for the “Spectral Range (ppm)” and “Chemical
Shift RMSD Cutoff” are automatically updated for 13C nuclei, and the 13C chemical shifts extracted from the 13C HSQC-TOCSY (column) trace of the pair is entered. In Figure S-6, the query for the corresponding 13C peak list yields a single hit, which is also the ribose
ring of inosine. Therefore, both traces independently identify inosine
as the compound belonging to this pair of HSQC-TOCSY traces. The query
results of all such pairs are compiled in Table 2. Overall, 23 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces are identified as
a single, correct hit. For the remaining traces, the querying of 11 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces yield the correct metabolite as the top
hit (from an average of 2.9 hits). For the remaining 4 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces, ambiguities among the top hits could be resolved
after querying the corresponding 1H HSQC-TOCSY chemical
shifts whereby the correct hit turned out to always be the top one
(Table S-5). The total set of 38 1H and 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces belong to 33 different metabolites.

The peak list of a 1H HSQC-TOCSY trace from the 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectrum is queried against
the database. Query returns the best matching compound (in this case
ribose ring of inosine) with the chemical shift root-mean-square difference
(rmsd) before and after a uniform shift of −0.004 ppm was applied.
A mismatch number M = 0 indicates that the number
of query peaks and database peaks for inosine were the same.

a The numbers behind certain compound
names that are not in parentheses are used only when
more than one spin systems of a metabolite is observed in the Table
and they denote the different spin systems of the metabolite. “1H” and “13C” labels behind
compound names indicates whether the queried trace is a 1H HSQC-TOCSY trace or 13C HSQC-TOCSY trace.

b Chemical shift root-mean-square
difference (in units of ppm) between the input and database chemical
shifts.

c Integer mismatch
parameter, which
is the absolute value of the difference between the number of input
and database chemical shifts.

d Amount by which the input chemical
shifts were uniformly shifted (in ppm) so that the RMSD with respect
to the database chemical shifts is minimized.

The cross-peaks of these metabolites are shown by
superimposing
a 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectrum reconstructed
from the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database onto the experimental
spectrum (Figure S-7A). For comparison, Figure S-7B shows the 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectrum reconstructed from entire 1D NMR spectra
revealing a large number of false positive cross-peaks, similar to
Figure 2B. To compare the performance of 1H(13C)-TOCCATA with 1D NMR databases, we submitted
the 38 1H and 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces for 1D NMR
querying. BMRB, MMCD, COLMAR, and HMDB identified 16, 4, 25, and 27 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces correctly as best hits, respectively.
The detailed query performance for each database for all 1H and 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces can be found in Supporting Information Table S-5. Similar to 1H–1H TOCSY results, metabolites existing
in multiple isomeric states and/or multiple spin systems can be identified
by the new database with very high accuracy and efficiency. 1H(13C)-TOCCATA provides ∼21% improvement over the
best-performing 1D 13C NMR query.

The MMCD16 database also allows the
querying of chemical shifts extracted from 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY. Again, this database does not group the HSQC-TOCSY
peaks into different spin systems and/or different isomeric states.
To compare the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA with the MMCD
2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY NMR database, we
queried 38 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY sets of
peaks against the MMCD database. It allowed the identification of
20 HSQC-TOCSY peak lists correctly as first hits (with the “H_tol”
and “C_tol” parameters set to 0.05 ppm and 0.2 ppm,
respectively).

Finally, 38 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces
were queried against
our original 13C-TOCCATA database20 developed for uniformly 13C-labeled metabolites. Not
surprisingly, those cell lysate metabolites that possess nonprotonated
carbons, namely tyrosine, phenylalanine, nicotinic acid, phosphoenolpyruvate,
and nucleic acid portions of thymidine, cytidine, dTMP, and uridine
could not be identified in the 13C-TOCCATA database when
using a mismatch parameter Mmax = 0. Therefore,
the querying of 13C HSQC-TOCSY traces from 2D 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY is best performed with the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database, while querying of 13C TOCSY traces from 13C–13C
CT-TOCSY is optimal when using the 13C-TOCCATA database.

The 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database can also be
applied to 13C-labeled samples dependent on the type of
TOCSY experiment chosen for metabolite identification. The analysis
of 1H–1H TOCSY and 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectra of 13C-labeled samples is
best performed with the new database 1H(13C)-TOCCATA,
whereas for the analysis of the 13C–13C CT-TOCSY spectrum of 13C labeled samples the original 13C-TOCCATA database is best suited.

In this study, 21
metabolites were identified in both 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY and 1H–1H TOCSY spectra.
An additional 12 metabolites were identified only
in 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY, but not in 1H–1H TOCSY, because their signals strongly
overlapped in the 1H–1H TOCSY spectrum,
as for example in the case of serine and N-acetyl-alanine. Additionally,
20 metabolites were only identified in 1H–1H TOCSY, but not in 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY,
because their signals were below the detection limit of the 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY spectrum such as in the case of
ethanolamine and proline. Therefore, in total, 53 different metabolites
could be positively identified in E. coli by using the 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database.

Conclusions
Accurate and unambiguous identification of the
metabolites in biological
samples is a key step for downstream metabolomics analysis. In the
past, 1D 1H NMR spectra have often been the first choice
for this task despite the fact that they frequently suffer from severe
spectral overlaps. For a quite complex, real-world metabolomics sample,
such as an E. coli cell lysate, we
find that this approach produces correct identifications for only
a small subset the compounds that can be achieved by 2D NMR methods
with many additional false positive identifications. Therefore, in
metabolomics studies, acquisition of at least one 2D NMR experiment
for unambiguous compound identification, such as a 1H–1H TOCSY or 13C–1H HSQC-TOCSY
experiment, is highly beneficial when combined querying against the
customized 1H(13C)-TOCCATA database. As metabolomics
databases continue to grow, the chances that two compounds have very
similar NMR properties increases. This requires customized databases
that take full advantage of the specific appearance of NMR information
in the raw spectra, as does 1H(13C)-TOCCATA,
for the unambiguous identification of a large number of mixture components.
It should be noted that 1H(13C)-TOCCATA can
be applied to NMR data collected at variable magnetic field strengths
as only the chemical shift information on each peak is utilized provided
that strong coupling effects are not dominant.

Although the
acquisition of 2D NMR experiments takes more time,
recent advances in 2D NMR methodology, including covariance NMR26 for TOCSY-type spectra, nonuniform sampling
for HSQC,27,28 single-scan and ultrafast HSQC,29 and approaches with shortened recovery delays
between scans30,31 are expected to help decrease
the measurement time making the use of multidimensional NMR methods
increasingly practicable also for applications involving multiple
metabolic samples.
