MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS)
has been used successfully
in mapping different lipids in tissue sections, yet existing protocols
fail to detect the diverse species of mitochondria-unique cardiolipins
(CLs) in the brain which are essential for cellular and mitochondrial
physiology. We have developed methods enabling the imaging of individual
CLs in brain tissue. This was achieved by eliminating ion suppressive
effects by (i) cross-linking carboxyl/amino containing molecules on
tissue with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride
and (ii) removing highly abundant phosphatidylcholine head groups
via phospholipase C treatment. These treatments allowed the detection
of CL species at 100 μm resolution and did not affect the amount
or molecular species distribution of brain tissue CLs. When combined
with augmented matrix application, these modifications allowed the
visualization and mapping of multiple CL species in various regions
of the brain including the thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex. Areas
such as the dentate and stratum radiatum exhibited higher CL signals
than other areas within the hippocampal formation. The habenular nuclear
(Hb)/dorsal third ventricle (D3 V) and lateral ventricle (LV) areas
were identified as CL “hot spots”. Our method also allowed
structural MS/MS fragmentation and mapping of CLs with identified
fatty acid residues and demonstrated a nonrandom distribution of individual
oxidizable (polyunsaturated fatty acid containing) and nonoxidizable
(nonpolyunsaturated containing) CLs in different anatomical areas
of the brain. To our knowledge, this method is the first label-free
approach for molecular mapping of diversified CLs in brain tissue.

==== Body
In eukaryotes,
the cardiolipins
(CL), a class of mitochondrion-specific anionic phospholipids, play
multiple structural and functional roles in bioenergetics, mitochondrial
signaling, and cellular fate pathways. While the aggregate abundance
of CLs in cells and tissues is low relative to other phospholipids
(2–3 mol %) within the mitochondrion, about a quarter of the
phospholipid molecules in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is
CLs, particularly in the matrix-oriented leaflet. CLs are associated
with multiple integral and peripheral mitochondrial proteins, from
electron-transporting respirasomes to anion channels and enzymes,
and are present in a noncomplexed form, thereby contributing to the
extreme curvature of mitochondrial cristae.1−5 During mitochondrial stress or damage, the asymmetric
CL distribution collapses resulting in its externalization to the
outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), leading to signaling events essential
for mitophagy and apoptosis.2,6,7 The general structure of CL (1,3-bis(sn-3′-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol) is a unique dimeric moiety, composed of two
phosphatidylglycerols connected via a glycerol backbone, which displays
two negative charges from the phosphate groups and four acyl chains.
In polyunsaturated CL species, these acyl chains readily undergo enzymatic
oxygenation2 which we have recently identified
as a novel generator of lipid mediators in mitochondria.8

This extraordinarily significant role in
cell and mitochondrial
physiology leads to a pressing need to develop quantitative methods
to define the isoforms of CL, their dynamics, expression, and of course
distribution in tissues. Contemporary liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) does allow us to identify, characterize, and quantify individual
CLs.9,10 Unfortunately, no specific or reliable “labels”
(fluorescent probes, antibodies) or in fact methods to define and
localize the tissue distribution of brain CLs, in total and as subtypes,
exists. While variants of imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) have been
used to demonstrate the spatial distribution of a number of abundant
(phospho)lipids in tissue, there have been no reports on the successful
imaging of CLs in brain tissue.11−13 This is because of the very low
abundance of CLs combined with their remarkable diversification and
distribution over numerous molecular species in the brain in contrast
to many other tissues.14

Here, we
report novel methods for the IMS of different CL species
in brain tissue sections which allows label-free spatial resolution.
Using this approach, we have (1) visualized and mapped multiple CL
species, (2) performed structural MS/MS fragmentation and mapping
of CLs with identified fatty acid residues, and (3) demonstrated a
nonrandom distribution of individual polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
containing and non-PUFA containing CLs in different anatomical areas
of the brain.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Chloroform
and ethanol (HPLC grade) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol was LC-MS grade
from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Water was purified by
a Milli-Q system (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). 1-Ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) was purchased from Thermo Scientific/Pierce Biotechnology
(Rockford, IL, USA). Phospholipase C (PLC) from B. cerus, ammonium acetate, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) were also
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Animals and
Tissue Preparation
All procedures were
preapproved and performed according to the protocols established by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University
of Pittsburgh. Brains from 17 day old male Sprague–Dawley rats
were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen with neither
fixation nor embedding and cut immediately. Brain tissue was affixed
to a cryotome block with minimal Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura FineTek USA,
Torrance, CA, USA). The blade and working surfaces of the cryotome
were cleaned with methanol immediately prior to cutting and at no
time did the blade come into contact with OCT. Coronal brain sections
from Bregma A 2.3 mm to A 3.2 mm were cut at −21 °C at
a thickness of 10 μm. These sections were applied to cold histology
slides coated with a conductive indium–tin oxide (ITO) surface
(Delta Technologies LTD, Loveland, CO, USA). Additional sections were
cut and applied to plain glass slides for immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining, and total lipid extraction. Lipid extraction
from dried tissue sections on glass slides was performed using the
modified Folch method as described previously.15 Total lipid extracts were dried under a steady stream of
grade 5.0 N2, then redissolved in 2:1 chloroform/methanol
to a total volume of 150 μL, and stored at −80 °C
prior to use.

In order to apply matrix more homogeneously than
airbrushes or TLC sprayers can achieve, we constructed a capillary-sprayer
from the electrospray source from a Thermo-Finnigan TSQ 7000 mass
spectrometer. The existing capillary was replaced with 75 μm
i.d. polyimide coated capillary tubing (Scientific Instrument Services,
Ringoes, NJ, USA). Sheath gas (grade 5.0 N2) was regulated
to 80 psi at the output of the nitrogen regulator. Further fine control
of nitrogen gas was achieved using a needle valve to maintain a flow
rate of 30 L/h. The spray nozzle was placed at 35 mm above the tissue.
A syringe pump delivered matrix solution at a rate of 2.0 μL/min.
This combination of gas flow, height, and deposition rate gave optimal
coverage of the tissue sections. For CL imaging, the tissue was first
treated with 50 μL of 500 mM EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide)
in MES buffer (100 mM, pH 3.7) for 2 h at room temperature and washed
with 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (200 μL, pH 6.7). The tissue
was then treated with PLC (0.01 units total in 50 μL of 50 mM
ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.7) for 15 min at 37 °C followed
by an additional wash with ammonium acetate buffer as described above.
After the chemical/enzymatic treatments, the tissue was vacuum-dried
for 2 h and DHB matrix (480 mM in chloroform/methanol, 2:1, v/v) was
applied in 2 s bursts with 120 s of drying time in between. This comprised
one spraying cycle. A total of 20 cycles was applied to the tissue.
Spraying in short (2 s) time increments with drying intervals (2 min)
in-between each spray aided in controlling solvent effects. A total
of 12 brain sections from three different animals was EDC/PLC treated,
and matrix was applied to image lipids at 750, 200, 100, and 50 μm
resolutions (see below).

Mass Spectrometry Analysis
MALDI-MS
and -IMS analyses
were performed using Bruker Ultraflex II and UltraFlextreme axial-TOF/TOF
mass spectrometers and a Solarix XR FTICR (Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance) mass spectrometer equipped with a 7.0 T magnet (Bruker
Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). The Ultraflex was equipped with a
337 nm wavelength N2 laser operating at a repetition rate
of 20 Hz while the UltraFlextreme and Solarix were equipped with 355
nm NdYAG lasers (1000 Hz repetition rate). The MALDI-TOF MS spectra
were acquired in reflector mode with a matrix deflection cutoff of
400 Da in both positive and negative polarities over a window of m/z 400–4000. MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra
were acquired in negative polarity mode over a window of m/z 300–4000 with 8 megaword transients and
a data reduction coefficient of 0.98. MALDI-TOF-MS/MS spectra were
acquired in LIFT mode with negative polarity and a mass isolation
window of 0.8% of the parent mass. This window size allowed full signal
transmission of ions from one CL cluster but gave no signal from adjacent
clusters. MALDI-TOF spectra were externally calibrated using a phospholipid
mixture while MALDI-FTICR spectra were calibrated using a lock mass
on the monoisotopic peak of GM1 (d18:1/18:0, m/z 1544.86944, [M – H]−). MALDI-IMS
images from the Ultraflex were acquired at lateral resolutions of
either 200, 100, or 50 μm for IMS or 750 μm for MS/MS
imaging, with a summation of either 100 (positive mode), 800 (negative
mode), or 3000 (MS/MS mode) laser shots per location. MALDI-MS/MS
images from the UltraFlextreme were acquired at a lateral resolution
of 200 μm with a summation of 2000 laser shots per location.
MALDI-FTICR-MS images from the Solarix were acquired at a lateral
resolution of 100 μm with an ion accumulation of 300 laser shots
per location and one analysis step. Random walking was performed every
10 (Ultraflex), 50 (Solarix), or 200 (Ultraflextreme) laser shots
within each location. Spectra from the Ultraflex were acquired with
a global attenuator offset of 60% and an attenuator range of 20% of
the maximum. Within that range, a laser energy of 40% was used for
positive mode and 50% for negative and MS/MS-mode. Spectra from the
Ultraflextreme were acquired with a laser focus setting of 1 (minimum)
and an attenuator offset of 49% with a range of 51% of the maximum.
Within this range, a laser energy of 100% was used. Spectra from the
Solarix were acquired with a laser focus setting of 1 (minimum) and
an attenuator offset of 0% with a range of 100%. Within this range,
a laser energy of 23% was used. MALDI-IMS images were produced from
the corresponding spectra which generated a heat map at a given m/z value using FlexImaging 3.0 (Ultraflex)
and FlexImaging 4.0 (UltraFlextreme and Solarix) software (Bruker
Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). Heat maps for a given ion were generated
with a mass window of ±0.25 Da (TOF) or 0.001 Da (FTICR) and
based on relative intensities with root-mean-squared (RMS) normalization
(FlexImaging 4.0) or no normalization (FlexImaging 3.0) unless otherwise
noted. Spectra from individual imaged areas were analyzed with FlexAnalysis
3.0 (Ultraflex), FlexAnalysis 3.3 (UltraFlextreme), and DataAnalysis
4.1 (Solarix). Spatial overlays of heat maps with histological features
were determined by coregistering fiducial markers on optical images
acquired from a microscope prior to matrix deposition and consulting The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates.16

LC-MS/MS analyses (to confirm CL structure) were
performed on extracts of tissue slices17 on a Thermo Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer
(ThermoFisher, Inc., San Jose, CA). CLs were analyzed using a Luna
C8 column (2.0 mm (i.d.) × 15 cm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Inc.)
on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA). The column compartment was maintained at 30 °C. Solvents
consisted of 2-propanol/water/triethylamine/acetic acid (45:5:0.25:0.25,
isocratic). For CL quantitation, LC was performed on a Luna Silica
column (2.0 mm × 15 cm) using a hexane/propanol/water solvent
system (43:57:1, solvent A; 43:57:10, solvent B) containing 10 mM
ammonium acetate. Gradient: 10–37% B in 15 min; 37–65%
B in 8 min and 65–100% B in 2 min; hold at 100% B for 22 min.
Tetramyristoyl CL (TMCL) was used as an internal standard. Flow was
maintained at 0.2 mL/min. Analysis was performed in negative ion mode
at a resolution of 140,000 for the full MS scan and 35,000 for the
MS2 scan in a data-dependent mode. The scan range for MS
analysis was 1200–1600 m/z with a maximum injection time of 100 ms using 1 microscan. A maximum
injection time of 128 ms was used for MS2 (high energy
collisional dissociation (HCD)) analysis with collision energy set
to 24. An isolation window of 1.0 and 0.5 Da was set for the MS and
MS2 scans, respectively. Capillary spray voltage was set
at 4.0 kV, and capillary temperature was 320 °C.

Immunohistochemistry
and Fluorescent Imaging of Mitochondria
in Rat Brain Tissue Sections
Thin (10 μm) frozen sections
were cut, mounted on slides, labeled with antibodies to TOM 20 (cat.
# sc-11415/A3113, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX), nuclei
counter stained with Hoescht dye, and mounted as previously described.18 Entire sections were scanned, and images were
collected using a Nikon 90i (Melvillen, NY, USA) upright microscope,
20× dry plan apochromat objective, and motorized stage. Individual
images were stitched together using Nikon Elements software. To overlay
the MALDI-IMS data with the immunocytochemical data, fiduciary structures
common to the semiserial IMS and light microscopy images were identified.
The MALDI-IMS images were resized such that the pixel count matched
that of the light microscopy images and images combined into a single
file. Various additive combinations of the MALDI-IMS images were made
and rendered to the same bit depth (12 bit) as the light microscopy
images and ratios calculated of MALDI-IMS intensity/mitochondrial
label intensity generated. These images are displayed as pseudocolored
images with a ratio between 0 and 2.

Results and Discussion
Treatment
with EDC and PLC Enables the Detection of CL in Rat
Brain Tissue
MALDI-IMS has been used to define the localization
of multiple classes of lipids in frozen tissue sections, with the
brain being the preferred tissue.19−29 Established conventional methods using 2,5-DHB as the matrix provide
precise lipid mapping and spectra (Supplementary Figure 1a, Supporting Information) for multiple classes
in the negative ion mode including phosphatidylserines (PS), phosphatidylinositols
(PI), sulfatides (ST), and gangliosides in the m/z range of 700–2,000. However, the m/z range of 1,400–1,600, in which CLs exist
is predominately populated by signals from ganglioside GM1 (Supplementary
Figure 1a, Supporting Information) and
is devoid of signals from any CL species (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 MALDI-IMS and LC-MS spectra of untreated (a,c) and EDC/PLC-treated
(b,d) rat brain tissue. MALDI spectra in the CL region, m/z 1420–1540, directly from untreated (a)
and EDC-PLC treated (b) tissue sections display a strong increase
in signal for CL as a result of EDC-PLC treatment. LC-MS of total
lipid extracts from untreated (c) and treated (d) tissue verify that
the treatment does not significantly affect the composition of tissue
CL. A range of m/z 1420–1540
was chosen because the IMS spectrum (see Supplemental Figure 1a, Supporting Information) was dominated by ganglioside
signals beyond m/z 1540. However,
additional CL clusters were noted in the region beyond m/z 1540 for the LC-MS spectrum.

We reasoned that the inability to detect CLs was due in part
to
the ion suppression of the limited CL signals by other more abundant
lipid ions such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and further by the highly
abundant and easily ionized carboxyl and amino groups of proteins
and other lipids. Accordingly, we introduced two major modifications
to conventional protocols: (i) chemical cross-linking of the tissue
surface with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC) and (ii) treatment with phospholipase C (PLC). EDC cross-links
accessible carboxyl and amino groups on tissue and hence limits ionization.
PLC limits highly abundant/ionizable PC signals by removal of cationic
head groups. Although no gross morphological changes were noted, it
is possible that, when the EDC and PLC treatments are utilized in
tandem, they may induce a complex reorganization of the tissue surface
which aids in CL detection by MALDI-IMS. Other major changes included
a modification of the matrix application methods by construction of
a spraying device that allowed for improved control of the matrix
deposition on tissue. We chose the matrix 2,5-DHB in combination with
a chloroform/methanol solvent system. This protocol allowed visualization
and mapping of multiple CLs in brain tissue (Figure 1b) centering around CL clusters of m/z 1426 [(16:1)1/(18:2)1/(18:1)2], 1450 [(18:1)1/(18:2)3], 1476 [(18:1)2/(18:2)1/(20:4)1], 1500 [(18:1)2/(20:4)2; (18:0)1/(18:2)2/(22:6)1], and 1524 [(18:1)2/(20:4)1/(22:6)1], the same major CL clusters detectable by LC-MS
(Figure 1c). Near unit mass resolution was
achieved in the MALDI imaging spectra allowing the mapping of various
brain CLs. With a spatial resolution of 200 μm (Bruker Ultraflex
II), a good compromise between heat map and spectral quality was achieved.
While imaging at higher spatial resolutions (100 and 50 μm)
was possible, it also resulted in a significant decrease in CL signals
(Supplementary Figure 2, Supporting Information).

This approach afforded heat maps and spectra of brain CLs.
A comparison
of CL spectra from treated and untreated tissue indicated that there
were no significant differences in CL molecular species (Figure 1c,d) after EDC/PLC treatment. The treated tissue
displayed the same five clusters of CL as the untreated tissue. When
quantitative analysis was performed, the amount of endogenous CL remained
essentially unchanged (3.3 ± 0.24 pmol/nmol Pi, untreated vs
3.1 ± 0.17 pmol/nmol Pi, EDC/PLC treated) as determined by LC/MS
in the presence of TMCL (internal standard). Signals of other lipids
in the negative ion mode included sulfatides (STs), phosphatidylinositols
(PIs), and gangliosides GM1 and GD1 (Supplementary Figure 1a and Supplementary
Table 1b, Supporting Information). One
exception was the isobaric species at m/z 834.6 (phosphatidylserine (PS) and ST, Supplementary Figure 1a, Supporting Information). Here, the decreased
signal was due to an inability of PS to ionize as a result of the
EDC coupling reaction. In positive mode imaging, EDC/PLC-treated tissue
displayed the same positive mass ions as the untreated tissue albeit
at a much lower signal intensity (Supplementary Figure 3a,b,c and
Supplementary Table 1a, Supporting Information). Essentially, PC signals were decreased most significantly followed
by PE, the latter due to EDC cross-linking. However, each modification
of the EDC/PLC protocol was essential as omission of any treatment
was associated with a decrease or loss of CL signal.

Mapping the
Spatial Distribution of CL Molecular Species in
Rat Brain Tissue
This innovative protocol allowed the previously
impossible comparison of the distribution of 21 CL species within
several CL clusters in brain subregions (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 1b, Supporting Information). Overall, higher intensities of CLs mapped to centrally located
areas, such as the dentate and stratum radiatum, within the hippocampal
formation. Higher mass CL species (m/z 1476, 1496, 1500, and 1502) also produced signals in the cortical
region and while CLs were present in the white matter their signals
were much reduced. This region-specific expression of different CL
species was also detectable at the single pixel (200 μm) level
(Figure 2b) in diverse anatomical regions,
including the medial dorsal thalamic nuclear (region A), the habenular
nuclear (Hb) and dorsal third ventricle (D3 V) (region B), the retrosplenial
cortex (region C), the dentate gyrus (DG, region D), the external
capsule white matter (region E), and the CA2 regions (region F). Notably,
the medial dorsal thalamic nuclear region yielded a spectrum almost
devoid of CL signal whereas the Hb/D3 V region was a CL “hot
spot” with a robust signal centered around m/z 1474. We are certain that pixels without CL signals
were not due to absence of matrix as signals for other lipids such
as ST (m/z 806.5) and PI (m/z 885.5) were robust (Supplementary Figure
4, region A, Supporting Information). Spectra
from the cortical, DG, and CA2 areas (region C, D, and F, Figure 2b) exhibited four major CL clusters centered around m/z 1450, 1474, 1500, and 1524. Regions
A–F also exhibited robust phospholipid signals with differences
in intensities relating to spatial locations (Supplementary Figure
4, Supporting Information).

of CL species in rat brain. (a)

treated rat brain coronal sections (right hemisphere). An optical

CL fatty acyl chain carbon number and the number of double bonds,
respectively. Scale bar = 1 mm. Spatial resolution = 200 μm.
(b) CL spectra were obtained from one individual pixel from each of
the representative anatomical regions (arrows, optical image) from
rat brain. These include the medial dorsal thalamic nuclear (region
A), the habenular nuclear (Hb) and dorsal 3rd ventricle (D3 V) (region
B), the retrosplenial cortex (region C), the dentate gyrus (DG) (region
D), the external capsule white matter (region E), and the CA2 regions
(region F).

Continued refinement
of the mapping of CLs by FTICR MS (Solarix
XR, FTICR, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) permitted us to (i) obtain
images of 17 CL species at 100 μm resolution and to map a larger
area encompassing the hippocampus and (ii) map masses for individual
CL species to a 0.001 Da mass accuracy (Figure 3a). With this increased spatial resolution, four very low abundance
CL species became undetectable. The CL species of m/z 1425.980 and 1427.996 were robust in the hippocampal
location with a decreased density in the thalamus and cortex. CL species
of m/z 1447.964 and 1449.980 had
a similar distribution in the cortex, hippocampal, and thalamic areas
with lower intensities for CLs of m/z 1451.996, 1454.011, and 1456.027. In addition, CL species of m/z 1447.964 displayed an intense signal
in the Hb/D3 V area. Higher resolution imaging confirmed that the
Hb/D3 V region was a consistent “hot spot” for CL and
identified the lateral ventricle (LV) as an additional “hot
spot” (see arrows). Overall, the thalamic, hippocampal, and
cortical areas of the brain were enriched with asymmetrical (containing
chiral carbons) polyunsaturated species such as CLs of m/z 1475.996, 1497.980, and 1499.996 in addition
to the symmetrical tetralinoleoyl-CL (m/z 1447.964). CL spectra/images generated by FTICR were baseline resolved
(Figure 3b,c; see also higher resolution images
for other lipid species in Supplementary Figure 5, Supporting Information, and a complete listing of all accurate
masses in Supplementary Table 2, Supporting Information).

MS/MS Analysis Maps CLs
with Identified Fatty Acid Residues
to Rat Brain Regions
To provide identification of CL species,
we employed MS/MS analysis of CL clusters using a Bruker UltraFlextreme
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) at 200 μm
spatial resolution (Figure 4). An increased
parent isolation window was needed to generate signals of sufficient
intensity for fragmentation. Numerous fatty acid fragments were detected
including species with m/z 253 (C16:1),
255 (C16:0), 279 (C18:2), 281 (C18:1), 283 (C18:0), 303 (C20:4), 327
(C22:6), 329 (C22:5), and 331 (C22:4) within each CL cluster. The
corresponding heat maps (Figure 4) are presented
on a relative intensity scale to aid in displaying the spatial localization
of very low abundance MS/MS fragments. In addition, typical phosphatidic
acid (PA) fragments (a and b ions, m/z 695, 697, and 699) and lyso-PA fragments (m/z 415, 417, and 419), normally seen upon CL fragmentation,
were evident (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7, Supporting
Information).30 The fragmentation
analyses were in agreement with the IMS acquisitions for the CL parent
ions. The linoleic acid fragment (m/z 279) from the 1476 cluster was more abundant in the thalamic and
cortical regions than in the hippocampal formation (Figure 4). These results carried through with the fragmentation
of the m/z 1448 and 1498 clusters.
The intensity of the m/z 279 fragment
from the various CL clusters was highest in the Hb/D3 V and LV areas
confirming these regions as CL “hot spots”. In addition,
the C22:5 (m/z 329) fragment from
different CL clusters was present at a higher level in the hippocampus,
while the arachidonic acid (C20:4, m/z 303) fragment was more homogeneously distributed for all three CL
clusters analyzed. Images for intermediate CL fragments are presented
in Supplementary Figure 6, Supporting Information. The MS/MS fragmentation pattern for the CL cluster m/z 1474 was also confirmed on a lower resolution
instrument (Bruker Ultraflex II) with results shown in Supplementary
Figures 7 and 8, Supporting Information.

Figure 4 UltraFlextreme MALDI IMS analysis of fatty acyl fragments from
the CL m/z 1448, 1476, and 1498
clusters. MS/MS analysis was performed on the CL clusters centered
around m/z 1448 (72:X), 1476 (74:X),
and 1498 (76:X). An optical image and heat maps (bar = 1 mm) for fragments
of m/z 253, 255, 279, 281, 283,
303, 327, 329, and 331 are shown. Spatial resolution = 200 μm.

Ratiometric Analysis of
CL/Mitochondria Displays Different Distributions
of PUFA vs Non-PUFA Containing CLs
With the logical assumption
that the relative distribution of individual CLs in mitochondria may
vary among anatomical areas of the brain, we performed ratiometric
analysis of CL images relative to mitochondrial abundance using immunohistochemical
(IHC) imaging of mitochondria from semiserial sections (Figure 5a). Ratiometric data from the individual CL species
are presented in Supplementary Table 3, Supporting
Information. CL images were aggregated into 4 groupings: all
CL, two PUFA groupings, and one non-PUFA grouping; ratiometric images
were generated (Figure 5b). In general, IHC
staining of mitochondria correlated very well with our IMS data. Overall,
a higher CL/mitochondria ratio was found in the hippocampal area compared
to the thalamus and cortex for most of the individual CL species (Figure 5a and Supplementary Table 3, Supporting Information). This was also evident in the resulting
intensities displayed in the ratiometric image of all CL species (all
CL, Figure 5b). Within the hippocampal area,
the pyramidal cell layer, DG and CA3 regions displayed a high density
of CL while the white matter region above the hippocampus displayed
the lowest density of CL relative to mitochondria (Figure 5a,b).

Figure 5 Ratiometric analysis of CL-IMS intensity to
mitochondrial immunofluorescence
intensity. Rat brain coronal sections (right hemispheres) were prepared
for CL-IMS, and CL heat maps were generated. Semiserial brain sections
were also prepared for mitochondrial immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
using a fluorescent-labeled TOM 20 antibody. Ratiometric images for
individual or grouped CL species are presented. (a) MS image intensities
for 17 individual CL species were normalized to an 8 bit range and
ratioed with the mitochondrial IHC image. Ratiometric images are displayed
as a heat map on a scale from 0 (purple, less CL relative to mitochondria)
to 3 (red, more CL relative to mitochondria). (b) CL-IMS groupings
(panels 1–4) include: all CL species (All CL); CLs containing
at least one PUFA of 18, 20, or 22 carbons (CL (72,74,76:X)); CLs
containing at least one PUFA of 20 or 22 carbons (CL (74,76:X)); non-PUFA
containing CLs of m/z 1427.996 [(16:1)1/(18:1)3] and 1456.027 [(18:1)4]. These
groupings are not normalized to the number of CL species; therefore,
the absolute intensity will be highest in the heat map which includes
all CL species. Ratioed images of CL groupings (panels 5–8)
were rendered to a 12 bit range and displayed as heat maps on a scale
from 0 (purple, less CL relative to mitochondria) to 2 (red, more
CL relative to mitochondria).

In the brain, the extraordinary geographic diversification
of CL
may be associated with its two major functions: (i) structural organization
of electron transport chain complexes and other mitochondrial membrane
proteins and (ii) signaling.3,5,8,31−33 It is believed
that non-PUFA containing CL species (with saturated and monounsaturated
acyls) and symmetric linoleoyl containing CL species mainly fulfill
structural requirements, whereas longer chain PUFA containing CL species
are used predominantly for signaling purposes.3,5,8,31−33 Ratiometric analysis revealed that the non-PUFA containing CL species, m/z 1427.996 and 1456.027, mapped to a
more central hippocampal location with CL/mitochondria ratios of 0.46
and 0.23, respectively (Figure 5a,b and Supplementary
Table 3, Supporting Information). These
non-PUFA containing CL species displayed extremely low intensities
in the thalamic nuclear and cortical regions (Figure 5a,b and Supplementary Table 3, Supporting
Information) but were present in the LV and Hb/D3 V areas.
When the CLs consisting of at least one PUFA chain containing 18,
20, or 22 carbons (CL 72:X, 74:X, and 76:X) were grouped and ratiometric
analysis was performed, much higher intensities were noted in the
thalamus and cortical regions (Figure 5b).
Similar ratiometric intensities for maps generated across the thalamic,
hippocampal, and cortical regions were evident for CLs containing
at least 20 or 22 carbon PUFA chains (Figure 5b). PUFA containing CL species also displayed a high CL/mitochondria
ratio in the Hb/D3 V and LV areas (Figure 5a,b and Supplementary Table 3, Supporting Information). A general trend was noted within each CL cluster; essentially
more saturated species also displayed a higher CL/mitochondrial ratio
in the hippocampus relative to thalamus and cortex as compared to
the more unsaturated CL species (Supplementary Table 3, Supporting Information). Overall, specific abundance
patterns of PUFA containing vs non-PUFA containing CL species were
revealed for different anatomical regions of the brain.

IMS
offers a unique opportunity for label-free analysis of many
types of individual phospholipids in tissue sections. The remarkable
analytical power of this methodology has been successful for some
lipid subclasses and in certain tissues where mitochondria (and hence
CL) are truly abundant. For example, in cardiac tissue in which only
a few CL isoforms predominate, detection has been recently achieved.12,13 On the other hand in the brain, in which CLs are present at low
abundance and with multiple isoforms, imaging has not been possible.
Essentially, this tissue remained an IMS “terra incognita.”
Here, we show, for the first time, a MALDI-IMS technique that allows
the imaging of important but low abundance CL species in different
anatomical regions of the brain. Our employment of modified tissue
protocols in conjunction with high mass accuracy FTICR instrumentation
and MS/MS fragmentation analysis allows enhanced spatial resolution
and identification of CL species in this difficult tissue. Recently,
an imaging mass spectrometry study by Stutts et al. also utilized
FTICR technology for the mapping of oxidized phosphatidylcholine species
in spinal cord tissue.34 While we did not
detect any oxidized cardiolipin species from naïve brain tissue
sections, our method is directly applicable to brain tissue sections
from animals whose brain function has been compromised, such as from
traumatic brain injury, an insult which has been shown to result in
the production of CL oxidation products.9

CLs regulate various enzymatic activities in mitochondria
and are
essential components of dynamic supramolecular complexes (respirasomes).31−33,35 Moreover, individual mitochondria
may display different bioenergetic-specific requirements for specific
CLs as described for murine brain tissue.36 In the brain, energy usage is dictated by (a) region-specific metabolic
demands, (b) the response to a particular stimulus (signaling), and
(c) the developmental stage of the tissue.33 Accordingly, when all of the CL species detected by IMS were integrated
and ratiometric analysis was performed, a clear correlation was found
between CL and a mitochondrial integral membrane protein TOM 20. These
data are in agreement with previous studies of other mitochondrial
markers like cytochrome oxidase (CO) in rat brain,37 whereby a low CO activity in the medial dorsal thalamic
nuclear region (our region A, Figure 2), a
moderate CO activity in the hippocampal formation (our region D, Figure 2), and an unusually high degree of reactivity in
the Hb nuclear area (our CL “hot spot”, region B, Figure 2) were detected.

The amazing spatial diversification
of different CL isoforms in
the brain is numerically far greater than that seen in other tissues.38 Moreover, the abundance of the long-chain PUFA
species in the brain cannot be explained exclusively by the bioenergetic
demands. Indeed, the diversity of CL isoforms in the mitochondria
of many highly effective ATP-generating tissues is very limited, mostly
limited to saturated and mono- and diunsaturated fatty acid residues.
It has been suggested, but never experimentally proven, that tetra-,
penta-, and hexaenoic CL species fulfill other fundamental, signaling
functions in the brain.8,38 Our IMS data demonstrate, for
the first time, the heterogeneity of PUFA containing and non-PUFA
containing CLs in different anatomical areas of the brain. Combined
with our previously demonstrated role for PUFA-CLs as precursors of
lipid mediators,8 our data provides direct
experimental evidence for the concept of CL-dependent signaling via
the generation of lipid mediators. The CL species, which we have mapped
to the thalamic and hippocampal areas which contain arachidonoyl and
docosahexanoyl fatty acid chains (m/z 1473.977, 1475.991, 1478.010, 1495.963, 1497.979, and 1499.995),
would inevitably serve as excellent substrates for these types of
signaling lipids. We have also defined the LV as an additional CL
“hot spot”, whereby the PUFA containing CL species (m/z 1473.976 and 1475.991) may also serve
as a source of signaling lipid mediators. The latter region-specific
CL species from the choroid plexus (CP)/LV area contains one or more
20:4 acyls which may serve as precursors to thromboxanes (TXs), the
major signaling lipid produced by the CP.39 Many of the PUFA containing CL species we have detected display
a higher CL/mitochondrial ratio within the hippocampal formation.
Given the role of the hippocampus in learning, memory, and spatial
navigation, it is tempting to speculate that these diversified PUFA-CLs
are needed to fulfill signaling roles essential for homeostatic and
regulatory functions involving cellular proliferation, differentiation,
and synaptogenesis.8,39−42

The ability to perform
MS/MS analysis underlies the detailed verification
of region-specific fatty acyl compositions of CLs in brain tissue
as it relates to CLs as a source of lipid mediators. We have shown
that, when fragmented, many of the CL clusters which contain C20:4,
C22:5, and C22:6 acyls (m/z 303,
329, and 327, respectively) display a widespread though specific distribution
in the thalamic, hippocampal, and cortical regions. These PUFA containing
CL species are potentially susceptible to attack by cyt c/H2O2 and release by PLA2 hydrolysis
that can lead to a variety of lipid mediators in these areas of the
brain.8

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have been able to map individual CL molecular
species in brain tissue sections using our modified tissue protocol
and demonstrate, for the first time, the heterogeneity of PUFA containing
and non-PUFA containing CLs in different anatomical regions of the
brain. In addition, we have defined the LV and Hb/D3 V areas of the
brain as CL “hot spots”. Finally, our modified protocol
also allowed us to map the fatty acyl profiles of several CL clusters
to various brain regions. Our novel method for the imaging of various
CL species and their fatty acyl compositions in the brain offers new
opportunities to obtain insights into a number of biologically intriguing
questions concerning the involvement of CL in signaling, development,
and function in normal and injured tissue.
