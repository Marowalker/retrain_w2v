Single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection is important for
early diagnosis, clinical prognostics, and disease prevention, and
a rapid and sensitive low-cost SNP detection assay would be valuable
for resource-limited clinical settings. We present a simple platform
that enables sensitive, naked-eye detection of SNPs with minimal reagent
and equipment requirements at room temperature within 15 min. SNP
detection is performed in a single tube with one set of DNA probe-modified
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a single exonuclease (Exo III), and the
target in question. Exo III’s apurinic endonucleolytic activity
differentially processes hybrid duplexes between the AuNP-bound probe
and DNA targets that are perfectly matched or contain a single-base
mismatch. For perfectly matched targets, Exo III’s exonuclease
activity facilitates a process of target recycling that rapidly shears
DNA probes from the particles, generating an AuNP aggregation-induced
color change, whereas no such change occurs for mismatched targets.
This color change is easily observed with as little as 2 nM of target,
100-fold lower than the target concentration required for reliable
naked eye observation with unmodified AuNPs in well-optimized reaction
conditions. We further demonstrate that this system can effectively
discriminate a range of different mismatches.

Ninety percent
of human genetic
variation takes the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
and these are involved in the etiology of many human diseases.1 SNP detection is therefore important for early
diagnosis, clinical prognostics, and disease prevention.2,3 Accordingly, numerous enzyme-based SNP detection schemes have been
developed, including microarray-based sequencing,4,5 primer
extension,6 ligation-based methods,7 enzyme invasive cleavage,8 and TaqMan assays.9 Although these methods
can achieve parallel, sensitive detection of SNPs, they are complex,
multistep techniques that require costly modified primers and are
often plagued by issues related to enzymatic efficiency and product
separation. Hybridization-based SNP detection methods such as dynamic
allele-specific hybridization,10 molecular
beacons,11 binary probes,12 and triple-stem probes13 offer
an alternative for identifying specific target sequences. However,
these suffer from low sensitivity or poor specificity at room temperature,
and effective SNP discrimination usually requires the use of high-stringency
conditions with precise temperature control. Additionally, the time,
expense, and specialized equipment and trained personnel required
for these various methods can make them impractical for use in small
hospital or developing-world settings. As such, there remains an urgent
need for a simple platform for rapid and sensitive SNP detection at
room temperature.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely used
for DNA sensing,14 largely because of two
important advantages.
First, it is straightforward to achieve surface modification of AuNPs
with hundreds of DNA probes.15 Second,
because the response of AuNPs to light is strongly dictated by their
environment, size, and physical dimensions, one can readily tune the
visible properties of AuNPs by changing their size, shape, surface
chemistry, or aggregation state.16 The
resulting color change can be so great that it is readily visible
to the eye. The Mirkin group was the first to report an AuNP-based
SNP detection scheme, which relied on hybridization-driven changes
in AuNP aggregation.17 In this assay, two
sets of DNA-modified AuNPs were cross-linked via target hybridization,
and a single-base mismatch was directly observed on a C18 thin-layer
chromatography plate at 58 °C.17 To
obtain clinically relevant sensitivity, however, this and subsequently
developed AuNP-based SNP detection platforms have required the use
of polymerase chain reaction,18 nicking
endonuclease,19 rolling circle amplification,20 or real-time ligation chain reaction21 to amplify their target prior to detection.
Low picomolar concentrations of target can be successfully detected
using these amplified approaches, but the target-triggered aggregation
of AuNPs requires a reaction time of at least 2 h, with precise temperature
control needed. An alternate approach uses the color change of unmodified
AuNPs to identify SNPs.22 This method is
based on differences in electrostatic interaction between single-
and double-stranded DNA on unmodified AuNPs.22 Typically, the adsorption of single-stranded DNA stabilizes AuNPs
against aggregation at salt concentrations that would ordinarily cause
colloid aggregation. Thus, single-base mismatched targets could be
detected through a red-to-blue color change within 5 min.22 However, even for well-optimized reaction conditions,
reliable detection with unmodified AuNPs required a target concentration
≥200 nM for naked eye observation.23

In response to the above limitations, we describe here a simple
and rapid colorimetric platform that can conduct SNP detection in
high-salt buffer without the need for specialized equipment or a complex
temperature ramping program. Our platform employs an AuNP-based, exonuclease
III (Exo III) amplified strategy to achieve colorimetric SNP detection
at low nanomolar target concentrations. The detection is performed
in a single tube with a single set of DNA capture probe (CP)-modified
AuNPs (Figure 1A), Exo III, and target DNA.
Exo III has been reported to have 3′-to-5′ exonuclease,
RNase H, 3′-phosphatase, and apurinic endonuclease activities.24 In this work, we take advantage of Exo III’s
apurinic endonucleolytic activity to distinguish between duplexes
formed by CP probes with either perfectly matched (PM) or single-base mismatched (SM) DNA targets, after which we employ this enzyme’s 3′-to-5′
exonuclease activity in a target-recycling mechanism that rapidly
generates a visible color readout within 15 min. This enables unambiguous
naked-eye identification of SNP genotypes at room temperature. If
the target sequence is perfectly matched to the CP sequence on the
AuNPs (Figure 1B, CP/PM duplex), the sensor
undergoes Exo III-amplified AuNP aggregation that yields a blue color;
in the case of a single-base mismatch (Figure 1C, CP/SM duplex), the sensor fails to aggregate and remains red.
This is the first example to demonstrate an amplified, colorimetric
SNP detection via a rapid aggregration of Exo III-sheared AuNPs at
room temperature.

Figure 1 Scheme for CP-modified AuNP, CP/PM, and CP/SM duplexes.
Each CP
is conjugated to the gold nanoparticle via a thiol linkage to a flexible
poly (T6) linker at the probe’s 5′ end (A).
The 45-nt CP is designed to match the SNP-containing target sequence
of interest and features two propanyl abasic sites (denoted by ‘X’).
The 5′ abasic site is situated at a position immediately 5′
to the SNP site. When a perfectly matched (PM) target DNA hybridizes
with the CP, it forms a CP/PM duplex (B) in which both the 5′
and 3′ abasic sites are flanked by matched bases, which facilitates
Exo III endonucleolytic incision. In contrast, the single-base mismatched
(SM) duplex (CP/SM) contains a single C–C mismatch-adjacent
to the 5′ abasic site (C), inhibiting Exo III endonucleolytic
digestion.

The preparation of our sensor
begins with the synthesis of DNA
CP-conjugated AuNPs. We first synthesized citrate-capped AuNPs (12
± 1 nm diameter) as previously reported25 and determined their concentration by measuring the maximum absorbance
at 518 nm. We then attached our 5′ thiolated CP DNAs (CP, 1, 45-nt) to the freshly prepared AuNPs. The probe features
a 5′ and a 3′ propanyl abasic site and is designed as
follows: 5′-thiol – poly(T6) – (N)11 – 5′ abasic site (5′-CXT) –
(N)9 – 3′ abasic site (AXC-3′) –
(N)7 – poly(T8)-3′. The 5′
poly(T6) acts as a flexible linker to improve target hybridization,
and the 3′ poly(T8) serves as a sticky end to protect
the CP against exonucleolytic digestion by Exo III. This probe is
specifically designed to recognize a target DNA sequence in which
the SNP site is situated directly 5′ to the 5′ abasic
site. The function of the 3′ abasic site is to fragment the
probe in order to easily facilitate target release at room temperature.

The CP-modified AuNPs are homogeneously dispersed in high-salt
reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.9), 50 mM KAc, 25 mM NaCl,
3 mM Mg2+, and 20 mM Ca2+) due to protection
by the immobilized CP strands (Figure 2A).
Typically, the solution is red in color. In the absence of target,
these immobilized CPs are resistant to the 3′-to-5′
exonucleolytic activity of Exo III by their single-stranded structure,
and we did not observe any digestion within 2 h (Figure 3A,B, probe + control).

Figure 2 Scheme for AuNP-based, Exo III-amplified
colorimetric SNP detection.
(A) The CP-modified AuNPs are homogeneously dispersed in the buffer.
(B) PM target hybridization with CP forms a perfectly matched duplex
with a 3′ poly(T8) sticky end. (C) Exo III preferentially
cleaves both match-flanked abasic sites through its apurinic endonucleolytic
activity, generating two nicks. (D) Exo III recognizes the 3′-hydroxyl
termini on these nicked ends and rapidly digests these fragments via
its exonucleolytic activity. (E) The CP fragments are sheared from
the particle, releasing the intact PM target. (F) The PM target is
recycled, hybridizing with a new CP on the same or a different AuNP.
(G) In the absence of CP strands, the AuNPs undergo salt-induced aggregation
with an associated red-to-blue color change. (H) In contrast, a single
mismatch flanking the 5′ abasic site in the CP–SM duplex
inhibits the apurinic endonucleolytic activity of Exo III. (I) Exo
III therefore only cleaves the match-flanked 3′ abasic site,
generating a single nick. (J) The enzyme subsequently performs 3′-to-5′
exonucleolytic digestion. (K) DNA digestion dramatically slows down
as Exo III approaches the mismatch-flanked 5′ abasic site,
leaving behind DNA duplex fragments on the particle. These fragments
prevent salt-induced AuNP aggregation, and the solution remains red.

Figure 3 Our sensor achieves colorimetric SNP detection
within 15 min at
room temperature. (A) UV–vis spectra of reactions performed
in the presence of 50 U Exo III with CP-modified AuNPs alone (probe
only) or with 20 nM SM or PM. (B) A red-to-blue color change is apparent
in the PM sample relative to the SM sample or probe only (control).

We then hybridized the modified
AuNPs with either perfectly matched
(PM, 2, 33-nt) or single-base mismatched (SM, 3, 33-nt) DNA targets. The PM target forms a duplex with the immobilized
CP in which both the 5′ and 3′ abasic sites are flanked
by matched bases, with the 3′ poly(T8) sequence
of CP forming a sticky end (Figure 2B). Exo
III is inactive at this 3′ sticky end26 and instead preferentially cleaves the match-flanked abasic sites
through its apurinic endonucleolytic activity (Figure 2C), converting the CP into three nicked duplex fragments (12-,
11-, and 8-bp). Exo III then recognizes the newly formed 3′-hydroxyl
termini on the nicked ends of the CP fragments and rapidly catalyzes
the stepwise removal of 5′-mononucleotides through its exonucleolytic
activity (Figure 2D). This shears
the CP fragments from the particle but releases the PM strand intact
(Figure 2E). The released PM target is then
recycled and hybridizes with another CP on the same or a different
AuNP to begin the cycle anew (Figure 2F). Ultimately,
all of the 45-nt CPs are sheared from the AuNPs, leaving only short
poly(T6) linkers behind on the particles. The sheared AuNPs
become unstable in the reaction buffer and undergo salt-induced aggregation
(Figure 2G), giving rise to a red-to-blue color
change (Figure 3, PM). Because a single target
can be recycled for many CP-modified AuNPs, the SNP signal is rapidly
amplified with visible AuNP aggregation within 15 min.

In contrast,
the CP-SM duplex contains a single C–C mismatch-flanked
5′ abasic site (5′-CXT/CTA) (Figure 2H), which significantly inhibits the apurinic endonucleolytic
activity of Exo III.27 Exo III therefore
preferentially only cleaves the match-flanked 3′ abasic site,
generating two nicked CP duplex fragments (23- and 8-bp) (Figure 2I). The enzyme subsequently catalyzes exonucleolytic
digestion at this site (Figure 2J). However,
this digestion dramatically slows down as Exo III approaches the uncleaved
mismatch-flanked 5′ abasic site,28 leaving DNA duplex fragments (≥12-bp) intact on the surface
of the particle. These long DNA duplexes have a melting point of ≥46.4
°C, limiting target release at room temperature and thus inhibiting
target recycling. These undigested fragments and probes protect the
AuNPs against salt-induced aggregation (Figure 2K), and the solution remains red (Figure 3, SM).

Successful SNP detection requires the endonucleolytic
and exonucleolytic
activities of Exo III to work synergistically: endonucleolytic incision
distinguishes between PM and SM target sequences, whereas exonucleolytic
digestion enables the target recycling process that promotes probe
shearing and AuNP aggregation. To confirm that exonucleolytic digestion
of Exo III is absolutely necessary to achieve aggregation of AuNPs,
we performed a control experiment in which we substituted Exo III
with human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1). It is known
that APE 1 specifically hydrolyzes the phosphodiester backbone at
the 5′ end of an abasic site, creating a nick in the DNA duplex
and leaving a 1-nt gapped intermediate with 3′-hydroxyl and
5′-deoxyribose phosphate termini;29 however, this enzyme possesses no exonucleolytic activity. When
we added 100 nM APE 1, we observed that mixtures containing CP-modified
AuNPs either alone or combined with the PM or SM target all remained
red after 4 h (Figure 4). This indicates that
the CP fragments remain bound to the AuNPs in the absence of 3′-to-5′
exonucleolytic activity and continue to protect the AuNPs against
salt-induced aggregation.

Figure 4 CP-modified AuNPs remain protected against salt-induced
aggregation
even after 4 h treatment with APE 1, which lacks exonuclease activity.
UV–vis spectra of the modified AuNPs alone or with 20 nM PM
or SM in the presence of 100 nM APE 1 are represented.

To further confirm the contribution of this exonucleolytic
activity
of Exo III to AuNP-based detection, we performed Exo III- or APE 1-mediated
enzymatic digestion of unmodified CP probes (4, 39-nt)
without 5′ poly(T6) ends hybridized to PM (5, 41-nt) or SM (6, 41-nt) targets that were
protected by a poly(T8) 3′ end. Gel electrophoresis
analysis demonstrated that both enzymes are capable of specifically
discriminating a single mismatch at the SNP site (Figure 5). We were able to visualize all three main products
of enzymatic cleavage (27-base, 23-base, and 16-base) with both nucleases
via 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), although
in varying amounts that reflected differences in processing between
different enzyme-duplex combinations (Figure 5).

Figure 5 (A) Both Exo III and APE 1 are capable of SNP discrimination through
endonucleolytic incision, although APE1 is unable to generate an amplified
signal via target recycling due to the absence of exonuclease activity.
(B) Gel image of unmodified CP (4) alone or with the
poly(T8)-protected PM (5) or SM (6) target (10:1 probe/target ratio), either without enzyme, or incubated
with 10 units of Exo III or 100 nM APE 1. After heating at 80 °C
for 10 min to stop the reaction, we characterized the samples via
12% PAGE.

When we digested with Exo III,
efficient endonucleolytic incision
of CP/PM at the matched 5′ abasic site yielded products of
12-nt and 27-nt, which were largely absent in the mismatch-containing
CP/SM sample. The matched 3′ abasic site was efficiently incised
for both duplexes, resulting in products of 16-nt and 23-nt (Figure 5A). Because Exo III is inactivated on the mismatched
5′ abasic site for the CP/SM duplex, we observed a higher enzymatic
efficiency at its matched 3′ abasic site (Figure 5B, 23-nt product). Because Exo III could subsequently recognize
the nicked 3′ ends and exonucleolytically digest the incised
CP fragments (Figure 5A), the intact target
was recycled, and most of the 39-nt probes were depleted in the PM
sample and only a very small amount of 27- and 23-nt products remained
after this reaction (Figure 5B, PM with Exo
III). In contrast, with Exo III-treated CP/SM duplexes, the exonucleolytic
activity is significantly inhibited as Exo III approaches the mismatch-flanked
5′ abasic site, inhibiting target release and thus preventing
target recycling. As such, a large amount of the probe remains intact
in this sample (Figure 5B, SM with Exo III).
We observed a smeared band of ∼23 bases in the CP/SM samples,
indicating that the initial 23-nt product is being degraded to various
smaller products by Exo III exonucleolytic digestion. No exonucleolytic
digestion of Exo III is occurred on the poly(T8) related
16-nt incised product in both samples.

APE 1 also cleaves efficiently
at both the 5′ and 3′
abasic sites with the PM target (Figure 5).
Clearly, we observed enhanced cleavage at the matched 5′ abasic
site with the PM target, producing an increased amount of the 27-nt
fragment (Figure 5B, PM with APE 1). This is
because the 5′ matched abasic site exhibits a higher Tm (51.5 °C) than the 3′ matched
abasic site (Tm = 44.6 °C), and this
increased thermal stability results in a higher concentration of formed
duplexes and thus a higher endonuclease cleavage efficiency.30 As with Exo III, APE 1 fails to cleave the mismatched
5′ abasic site in the CP/SM sample, producing only a minimal
amount of 27-nt product, but yields a large quantity of 23- and 16-nt
products due to efficient cleavage at the matched 3′ abasic
site (Figure 5B, SM with APE 1). However, because
APE 1 does not possess 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic activity,
each of these cleaved products appears as a sharp, clear band in the
gel. In contrast to the Exo III-treated PM sample, most of the 39-nt
probe remains unprocessed in the APE 1-treated PM sample (Figure 5B). In the absence of exonucleolytic digestion,
it is most likely that each target molecule only hybridizes with a
single CP molecule, with no subsequent target recycling to amplify
the reaction. Because all of the nicked duplexes have a Tm well above room temperature, thermally induced dissociation
of CP-target complexes is also unlikely.

These results demonstrate
the critical contribution of Exo III
to our assay. Exo III-assisted fragment digestion and target recycling
in the PM sample result in thorough removal of CP strands from the
particle surface, rendering them susceptible to salt-induced aggregation
and yielding a visible color change. In contrast, although APE 1 can
achieve successful SNP discrimination through selective endonucleolytic
cleavage at the matched abasic site, there is no subsequent target
recycling, and the remaining cleaved fragments and probes effectively
protect the AuNPs against salt-induced aggregation, thereby preventing
a colorimetric readout.

Both the endonuclease and exonuclease
activities of Exo III are
greatly affected by divalent cations.27 To achieve optimal speed and accuracy of SNP detection, we assessed
the impact of cation concentrations on Exo III activity. We achieved
this by measuring the single-base mismatch discrimination factor (DF)
at different concentrations of calcium and magnesium. The DF is defined
as the ratio of the net colorimetric signal gain at 650 nm (after
subtracting background from probe only) obtained from AuNPs with the
PM target relative to that obtained with the SM target; thus, a larger
DF is indicative of better specificity. Ca2+ is a well-known
analogue for Mg2+ that contributes to the DNA binding specificity
of Exo III for its endonuclease function.32 Previous reports have demonstrated that in the presence of Ca2+, Exo III displays only 7 ± 2% of its normal endonucleolytic
activity at C–C mismatched 5′ abasic sites relative
to its activity at a matched C–G pair.27 In order to maximize SNP discrimination, we first optimized the
concentration of Ca2+ in the system. We used buffer containing
3 mM Mg2+ to produce a high-efficiency Exo III reaction,
with varied concentrations of Ca2+ ranging from 0 to 30
mM. In the absence of Ca2+, we observed only modest discrimination
(DF = 2) after 150 min. When we increased the Ca2+ concentration
to 10 mM, we obtained a maximum DF of 30 after 85 min (see SI, Figure S1). As we increased the Ca2+ concentration to 20 mM, we were able to achieve visible detection
after 15 min—5-fold faster than the reaction with 10 mM Ca2+, presumably because the elevated concentration of Ca2+ enhanced the salt-induced aggregation of AuNPs. Although
the presence of Ca2+ enhances formation of the protein–metal–DNA
complex, these ions can also inhibit the enzyme’s endonucleolytic
activity.32 Accordingly, at Ca2+ concentrations of 20 mM or higher, the DF decreased to 12 (SI, Figure S1).

Mg2+ strongly
stimulates the 3′ to 5′
exonuclease activity of Exo III due to its suitable ionic radius and
electronegativity,33 and we sought to further
optimize assay performance by adjusting the concentration of Mg2+. We fixed the buffer Ca2+ concentration at 20
mM and varied the Mg2+ concentration between 0 and 10 mM.
We found that the activities of Exo III increased as we raised the
Mg2+ concentration, achieving a maximum DF of 14 with 2
mM Mg2+ after 40 min (SI, Figure
S2). At higher Mg2+ concentrations, the reaction rate accelerated
but the DF decreased due to nonspecific digestion of CP/SM duplexes
by Exo III; thus, we observed that the DF decreased to a plateau of
10 at Mg2+ concentrations ≥4 mM. In order to balance
reaction speed and specificity, we selected a reaction buffer containing
3 mM Mg2+ and 20 mM Ca2+. This formulation ensures
that Exo III efficiently binds and cleaves at matched abasic sites
and performs rapid exonucleolytic digestion of the resulting fragments
while also inhibiting Exo III binding of mismatched abasic site, yielding
good specificity (with a DF of 12) within 15 min. Under these reaction
conditions, our assay allows us to detect as little as 10 nM PM target
at room temperature after 15 min by naked eye (SI, Figure S3). In contrast, the sensor generated only a slight
signal change with SM target during the first 2 h. We can greatly
improve the sensitivity of the AuNP-based/Exo-amplified SNP assay at
lower temperatures, although there is a trade-off between reaction
time and limit of detection. We obtained a detection limit of 2 nM
(S/N > 3) by performing the reaction at 4 °C
for 4 h, and the color change was great enough for naked eye observation
(SI, Figure S4). This may be slow, but
it has the advantage of being significantly simpler than other reported
SNP assays and competes well in terms of specificity and sensitivity.

Because the hybridization between the AuNP-attached CP probe and
DNA target is relatively rapid in homogeneous solution,34 we presume that exonuclease digestion-mediated
AuNP aggregation is the rate-limiting step. We assume that the AuNPs
are only able to aggregate when all or a great majority of the CP
probes are sheared from the particle. We performed a time course of
reactions between CP-modified AuNPs and both PM (2) or
SM (3) and estimated the rate constants of the enzymatic
reaction by fitting the time course data to the Michaelis–Menten
equation (Figure 6). For the PM sample, we
calculated a Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of 426 ± 20 nM, an apparent turnover number for target
DNA (kcat) of 1.26 min–1, and thus a reaction efficiency (kcat/Km) for Exo III of 0.0030 min–1 nM–1. In contrast, we could not
obtain accurate calculation of rate constants for the SM reaction
due to the much slower Exo III reaction. Our Km value for the AuNP-attached CP system is ∼3
times lower than that of Exo III observed in solution,27 suggesting that the kcat in our SNP sensor incorporates the rate constraints for incision
and digestion of Exo III and the aggregation of AuNPs.

Figure 6 Determination of Exo
III kinetics in the AuNP-attached CP system.
(A) Time course of our SNP sensor at different PM target concentrations.
The absorbance difference (ΔA) between AuNP-attached probe alone
and with PM was recorded at 524 nm. (B) We calculated the rate constant
of the Exo III reaction by fitting time-course data to the Michaelis–Menten
equation.

Lastly, we demonstrated the generality
of our SNP sensor by testing
its discrimination ability against SM targets containing different
single-base mismatches (C–C (3), C–T (7), and C–A (8)) at the 5′ abasic
site. The current sensor offers highly accurate SNP detection, and
we can easily detect any single-base mismatch (C, T, or A) located
within a 33-nt DNA strand. We found that assays with SM targets containing
all three mismatched bases remained red after 2 h, whereas the PM
target generated a blue color switch after 15 min (Figure 7A). The highest level of discrimination occurred
with duplexes containing a C–C mismatch (DF = 12), whereas
the lowest level was observed with a C–T mismatch (DF = 8.5).
This variability is to be expected, because mismatch thermodynamics
depend on the identity of the mismatched base pair as well as the
identity of its near neighbors.35 On the
other hand, these results are in contrast to a report by Masayoshi
et al. that the endonucleolytic activity of Exo III is only meaningfully
inhibited by a C–C mismatch positioned 5′ to an abasic
site.27 When we switched the single-base
mismatches (T–T (9) and T–G (10)) from the 5′ to the 3′ side of the 5′ abasic
site, we no longer observed the ability to discriminate single-base
mismatches (Figure 7B), confirming that Exo
III-mediated SNP discrimination is based on its 5′ endonucleolytic
activity.36

Figure 7 Generality of mismatch
detection of the AuNP-based, Exo III-amplified
sensor. (A) Our sensor can effectively discriminate SM from PM regardless
of which mismatched base is located at the 5′ abasic site.
(B) In contrast, our sensor could not discriminate mismatches positioned
3′ to the 5′ abasic site, due to the 5′ endonucleolytic
activity of Exo III. Data show UV–vis spectra of CP-modified
AuNPs probe alone or with 20 nM PM or SM sequences after a 15 min
incubation with Exo III at room temperature.

We report here a remarkably simple platform that enables
sensitive,
naked-eye detection of SNPs at room temperature within 15 min. The
entire assay is performed in a single tube with one set of DNA probe-modified
AuNPs, a single enzyme, and the target DNA. In the presence of a perfectly
matched target, target–probe duplexes are first endonucleolytically
cleaved by Exo III at both matched abasic sites on the probe to form nicked
duplexes, and the nicked strands are then rapidly degraded via the
exonucleolytic action of Exo III, thus releasing the target. The released
target can then hybridize with another probe to start the cycle anew.
This recycling process amplifies the signal from the PM target and
ultimately strips the probes from the AuNPs, resulting in salt-induced
AuNP aggregation with a visible color change to blue as a readout.
In contrast, the initial endonucleolytic processing is inhibited for
mismatched targets, stalling exonucleolytic digestion, and the AuNP
solution remains red in color. This color change is easily observed
with as little as 2 nM target by naked eye, which is 100 times lower
than the target concentration that is required for reliable naked
eye observation with unmodified AuNPs in well-optimized reaction conditions.23 However, a 2 nM detection limit will not be
sufficient to omit a target amplification step. To obtain clinically
relevant sensitivity (∼ fM), we are now working to incorporate
an amplification strategy into this SNP detection platform to achieve
real-time SNP detection at low pM or fM concentrations. Because the
aggregation of AuNPs is caused by Exo III-mediated DNA shearing from
the particle surface, we expect that this system could also be rendered
applicable in complex biological samples by using nuclease-resistant
phosphorothioated probes.

Importantly, our SNP detection system
can readily discriminate
SNP-containing targets regardless of which mismatched base is positioned
at the 5′ abasic site. This feature provides direct SNP detection
without the need of complicated probe design. No specialized equipment
is required because SNP is colorimetrically dicriminated in one-step,
one-pot reaction at room temperature. Those attributes offer the opportunity
for multitarget, parallel SNP analysis over molecule beacons37 and TaqMan probes,38 which often require delicate probe design and precise temperature
control. Our colorimetric detection platform can be easily transferred
into a multiplexed, paper-based device to permit rapid, cheap, and
immediate screening of SNPs. Given that a short abasic site inserted
oligonucleotide could be introduced to hybridize the target-binding
portion of any aptamer,39 we believe that
our platform can be generalized for the detection of a variety of
non-DNA targets, including proteins, small molecules, metal ions,
and even whole cells.
