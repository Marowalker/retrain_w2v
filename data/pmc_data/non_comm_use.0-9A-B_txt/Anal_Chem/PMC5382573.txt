Oxidative stress,
a state in which intra- or extracellular oxidant
production outweighs the antioxidative capacity, lies at the basis
of many diseases. DCFH2-DA (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate) is the most widely used fluorogenic probe for the detection
of general oxidative stress. However, the use of DCFH2-DA,
as many other fluorogenic redox probes, is mainly confined to the
detection of intracellular oxidative stress in vitro. To expand the
applicability of the probe, an alkaline hydrolysis and solvent extraction
procedure was developed to generate high-purity DCFH2 (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein)
from DCFH2-DA using basic laboratory equipment. Next, the
utility of DCFH2 was exemplified in a variety of cell-free
and in vitro redox assay systems, including oxidant production by
transition metals, photodynamic therapy, activated macrophages, and
platelets, as well as the antioxidative capacity of different antioxidants.
In cells, the concomitant use of DCFH2-DA and DCFH2 enabled the measurement and compartmentalized analysis of
intra- and extracellularly produced oxidants, respectively, using
a single read-out parameter. Furthermore, hepatocyte-targeted liposomes
were developed to deliver the carboxylated derivative, 5(6)-carboxy-DCFH2, to hepatocytes in vivo. Liposome-delivered 5(6)-carboxy-DCFH2 enabled real-time visualization and measurement of hepatocellular
oxidant production during liver ischemia-reperfusion. The liposomal
5(6)-carboxy-DCFH2 can be targeted to other tissues where
oxidative stress is important, including cancer.

==== Body
Oxidants in the form of reactive
oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS or RNS), transition metals, and peroxidases
are extensively studied because of their involvement in numerous health
and disease states. To this end, redox-sensitive fluorogenic probes
are commonly employed because of their low cost, relative nontoxicity,
and easy application.1,2 Of the commercially available
probes, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH2-DA) is the most widely used. Following
diffusion across the plasma membrane, esterases cleave the acetate
groups to generate the more hydrophilic 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
(DCFH2) that is retained in the cytosol. Oxidation of DCFH2 yields the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF, λex = 503 nm, λem = 523 nm)
that can be measured spectrofluorometrically (Figure 1A). DCFH2 reacts with a wide array
of oxidants, albeit at different reaction constants.2,3 The probe is therefore an ideal indicator of redox shifts and general
oxidative stress.

diacetate (DCFH2-DA, nonfluorescent), its deacetylated
derivative 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
(DCFH2, nonfluorescent), and its oxidized end-product 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF, fluorescent). (B) Standard operating procedure for the preparation
and purification of DCFH2 (detailed in the Supporting Information, section S–VIII).

Because of its hydrophilicity
and consequent membrane impermeability,
DCFH2 holds unique benefits over DCFH2-DA in
terms of detecting extracellularly formed oxidants as well as its
potential for targeted delivery, for example, through encapsulation
in liposomes. DCFH2 can be prepared from its parent compound
DCFH2-DA though alkaline hydrolysis. Methods for the preparation
of DCFH2 from DCFH2-DA have been described by
others,3−8 but the reaction conditions have never been optimized and the end-product
has never been completely characterized. Moreover, DCFH2 prepared through these methods needed to be used immediately due
to its limited stability in aqueous solvent and contained residual
salts from the hydrolysis step, rendering it unsuitable for some assays.
To overcome these limitations, a simple and fast alkaline hydrolysis
and liquid two-phase extraction method was developed and optimized
(Figure 1B).

The method presented here yields high purity, stable DCFH2 that can be dissolved in different organic solvents depending on
its intended use. As a result, the probe has a long shelf life and
can be employed in multifarious assays, as is exemplified below. The
preparation procedure takes less than 2 h and can be performed in
any laboratory with standard reagents and equipment at minimal cost.
Moreover, the method can be applied to prepare the more hydrophilic
5(6)-carboxy-DCFH2 (CDCFH2) from its commercially
available diacetylated precursor. CDCFH2 can be used in
liposomal formulations for selective delivery of the probe to target
tissues, such as the liver or solid tumors, to intravitally measure
oxidative stress in vivo. For these purposes, a selectively hepatotargeted
liposomal probe delivery system was developed to visualize and quantify
hepatocellular oxidant formation. The proof-of-concept is provided
here for hepatic ischemia-reperfusion.

Experimental Section
A concise description of the preparation of DCFH2 from
DCFH2-DA is provided here. The standard operating procedure
as well as all other materials and methods are detailed in the Supporting Information, indicated by the prefix
“S–”. The standard operating procedure is described
in section S–VIII.

Step 1: Deacetylation of
DCFH2-DA
DCFH2 was prepared from DCFH2-DA by alkaline hydrolysis
of the acetate groups (Figure 1A). The deacetylation of DCFH2-DA at increasing
concentrations of NaOH was assessed by absorption spectroscopy (S–II) and thin layer chromatography (S–III). From these experiments, it was
concluded that the optimal NaOH concentration for DCFH2-DA deacetylation was 0.1 M.

Step 2: Purification of
DCFH2
Following
DCFH2-DA deacetylation in aqueous NaOH, DCFH2 was purified by liquid phase extraction (Figure 1B). An equivalent volume of 0.2 M aqueous
HCl was added under continuous vortexing to precipitate DCFH2. The precipitated DCFH2 was subsequently washed thrice
(2000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) in ice-cold acidified Milli-Q (pH
= 1) to remove excess salt. Chloroform was then added under continuous
vortexing to extract DCFH2 from the aqueous phase. Following
phase separation, the aqueous phase was removed and all chloroform
was evaporated under a continuous stream of nitrogen gas. The DCFH2 pellet was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol and
stored under a nitrogen atmosphere at −20 °C in the dark.
It is imperative that DCFH2 is shielded from light during
all steps, as DCFH2 auto-oxidizes upon light exposure.

Results and Discussion
The most important features of DCFH2 prepared through
the method presented here are, first, a purity of ≥95% (S–V) at a 54.2% yield (S–IV), which can be increased to ∼90% by omitting
the washing steps. No chloride from the washing step was detectable
in the methanol stock (S–VII), implying
that other ions are likely also absent when precipitated DCFH2 is directly extracted into chloroform. Second, the mean ±
SEM molar extinction coefficient of DCFH2 in methanol,
which can be used to spectrophotometrically determine stock concentrations,
is 7.6 ± 1.5 × 103 M–1·cm–1 at the absorption maximum of 287 nm (S–IX). The absorption maximum is comparable
in nonbuffered water and neutral HEPES buffer, but undergoes a bathochromic
shift in aqueous alkaline solvent (S–X). Third, the DCFH2 stock solution is stable in methanol
and dimethyl sulfoxide for at least 4 wk in the dark (S–XI), but stock solutions stored up to
20 months have been used without indication of decay (i.e., formation
of DCF). Finally, DCFH2 is oxidized to DCF in the presence
of oxidants, which was demonstrated in a variety of cell-free, cell-based,
and in vivo assays.

In the cell-free assays, DCFH2 was employed to spectrofluorometrically
measure the redox catalytic activity of the transition metals Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu+, and Zn2+ in
neutral HEPES buffer (Figure 2A) and pH-neutralized Milli-Q (Figure S11) at ambient O2 tension. Iron and copper are
clinically relevant since both play a role in oxidative stress-mediated
diseases such as hemochromatosis9 and Alzheimer’s
disease.10 Fe2+, for instance,
is presumed to bridge between organic molecules (e.g., DNA, proteins,
or DCFH2) and O2, and facilitate O2-mediated oxidation of the organic compound involved.11 Fe2+ can moreover reduce O2 to O2•–, thereby further enhancing
oxidant formation.11 DCFH2 oxidation
by Fe2+ occurred at a faster rate than by Cu+ and was slow and absent in the presence of Mn2+ and Zn2+, respectively.

of DCFH2 was confirmed in oxidant-producing 3T3 fibroblasts
(F) and RAW 264.7 macrophages (G) using flow cytometry. (H) Generation
of DCF from DCFH2 or DCFH2-DA by 3T3 fibroblasts
subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation. DCF formation from DCFH2-DA (I) or DCFH2 (J) by RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated
with IFN-γ and/or PMA. The inset in Panel I shows which oxidants
are likely involved.

Redox reactions are affected by pH and are therefore frequently
assayed in buffered systems to mimic physiological conditions. However,
the type of buffer used in redox assays is critical for experimental
outcome. In a standardized Fenton system (Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + •OH + OH–), which is part of the Haber-Weiss reaction,12 redox reactions proceed best in Tris- and HEPES-buffered
solutions, indicating that these are preferred buffers for similar
experiments. DCFH2 oxidation is impaired in solutions buffered
with carbonate, citrate, and PBS (Figure 2B). These findings are in accordance with
data on the rate of Fe2+ auto-oxidation in different buffer
systems.13

The probe can also be
used to determine the antioxidative and pro-oxidative
properties of pharmaceutical preparations. In case of the former,
PEGylated DSPC liposomes containing the antioxidants γ-tocopherol,
α-tocopherol, curcumin, melatonin, and α-lipoic acid effectively
scavenged oxidants in a DCFH2-probed Fenton system (Figure 2C). DCFH2 was further instrumental in measuring the oxidant-generating potential
of illuminated photosensitizer-containing liposomes used for photodynamic
therapy of cancer.14 Both assays allow
comparative analysis of outcome parameters to, for example, determine
which antioxidant or pro-oxidant formulation is optimal for its intended
purpose.

The formation of oxidants in cells is part of regular
metabolism
and biochemical signaling that, under pathological conditions, can
become disproportional and lead to oxidative stress and ultimately
cell death. Platelets, for example, execute specific functions through
ROS (O2•–, H2O2, •OH) and RNS (•NO).15 DCFH2 was used to analyze extracellular
oxidant formation platelets activated by agonists that bind different
platelet receptors (Figure 2E). Incubation of (activated) platelets in the presence of
DCFH2 revealed that the native platelet agonist thrombin
induced extracellular oxidant formation at an equal propensity as
the intracellular O2•– generator
PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), suggesting that the PMA-induced
O2•– (or derivate oxidants) diffused
out of the platelets. Snake venom-derived convulxin triggered minimal
DCFH2 oxidation, altogether in support of previous reports.16

The proposition that hydrophilic DCFH2 does not transgress
the plasma membrane was confirmed in resting as well as oxidant-producing
3T3 fibroblasts (Figure 2F) and RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 2G) using flow cytometry. Consequently, DCFH2 and DCFH2-DA may be used complementarily to discern between
intracellular and extracellular oxidant formation in these cell types.
The simultaneous application of both probes unveiled that oxidants
were predominantly formed intracellularly in 3T3 fibroblasts under
normoxic conditions (Figure 2H, blue vs green line). Whereas intracellular oxidant formation
increased when cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (red
vs blue line), extracellular oxidant formation remained unchanged
under these conditions (orange vs green line). These data indicate
that cytosolic oxidative stress occurs during hypoxia/reoxygenation,
presumably as a secondary effect of mitochondrial oxidant formation.17

In RAW 264.7 macrophages, oxidant formation
was most abundant in
cells stimulated with interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and PMA as a
result of the formation of •NO (Figure S12) and O2•–,
respectively (Figure 2I,J). Oxidative stress was more pronounced in the extracellular compartment,
most likely due to the localization of NOX2-dependent O2•– formation (i.e., at the plasma membrane)
in combination with the long half-life and membrane-transgressing
properties of iNOS-derived •NO. Accordingly, inhibition
of iNOS and NOX2 by L-NAME (Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI),
respectively, significantly hampered DCFH2 oxidation (Figure S13). Reduced iNOS activity resulted in
a ∼50% decrease in DCF formation compared to •NO- and O2•–-producing activated
cells (Figure S13), whereas NOX2 inactivation
reduced DCFH2 oxidation to a level that was comparable
to resting cells (i.e., ∼97% decrease). These findings pinpoint
cellular O2•– formation as a crucial
factor for the extracellular formation of oxidants by activated RAW
264.7 macrophages, either through its reaction with •NO (Figure 2I, inset)
or via its dismutation into H2O2. Nevertheless,
since DPI inhibits mitochondrial O2•– formation as well,18 sources other than
NOX2 could also contribute to the extracellular formation of oxidants
by activated RAW 264.7 macrophages.

Lastly, intracellular oxidative
stress was measured in vivo using
liposome-encapsulated CDCFH2, a more hydrophilic form of
DCFH2 that is oxidized to the highly fluorescent CDCF (λex = 495 nm, λem = 525 nm) by oxidants.19 The alkaline hydrolysis and two-phase liquid
extraction method was used to prepare CDCFH2 from CDCFH2-DA. Next, CDCFH2 was encapsulated in hepatotargeted
liposomes. The liposomes, composed of DPPC, cholesterol, lactosyl-phosphatidylethanolamine
(LPE) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) in varying molar
ratios, were optimized in vitro (S–XVI through S–XIX) and investigated in vivo in terms of
intrahepatic accumulation (S–XX and S–XXI) and distribution to hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells (Figure 3A). CDCFH2 was subsequently encapsulated into the optimal formulation for hepatocellular
targeting (i.e., DPPC:cholesterol:GM1 in a 55:40:5 molar ratio) to
visualize oxidative stress in vivo. Hepatocellular oxidative stress
was induced using a standardized mouse model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion
injury,20 which is associated with extensive
oxidative stress in the reperfusion phase. Accordingly, hepatocellular
CDCF formation was observed in the ischemia-reperfusion group but
not in sham-operated control animals (Figure 3B–D). These data are the first to
show selective hepatocellular oxidant formation during early reperfusion.
Proof-of-concept was provided only in the liver, where redox perturbations
lie at the basis of numerous disorders. Nevertheless, the applicability
of the method is expandable to other redox-pertinent tissues to which
liposomes can be targeted, such as solid tumors21 and atherosclerotic plaques.22

operation in mouse livers. (A) Uptake of NBD-labeled GM1 and GM1 +

model of liver IR (60 min ischemia) using CDCFH2-encapsulating
GM1 liposomes. (C) Cumulative fluorescence formation during 20 min
reperfusion, which was significantly higher in the IR group compared
to sham controls.

As with all experimental
methods for the detection of oxidative
stress, there are aspects that exact attention when implementing (C)DCFH2 in any experimental protocol. Formation of O2•– as a byproduct of DCFH2 oxidation
as well as the presumed pH-dependence of DCFH2 reactivity
should always be taken into consideration when interpreting data obtained
with DCFH2(-DA).2 Furthermore,
the possibility of intercellular differences in esterase activity
on DCFH2-DA deacetylation and/or in basal redox state implies
that care should be taken with directly comparing different cell types.
Transporter-mediated DCF(H2) uptake and efflux trough organic
anion-transporting polypeptides 1B1 or 3 (OATP1B1/3)23,24 and MDR-associated ABC transporters (e.g., multidrug-resistance
protein-1; MRP-1),23,25 respectively, are expected to
influence assay outcomes. Consequently, it is not recommended to use
DCFH2 in assays involving cells that express OATP1B1/3,
such as hepatocyte-derived HepG2 or HepaRG cells.26 The presence of efflux proteins, for example, MRP-1 on
RAW 264.7 macrophages,25 is likely less
troublesome insofar as its effects will be limited to an underestimation
of intracellular DCF levels. Furthermore, assay interference by efflux
proteins is not specific for DCF(H2) since affinity toward
MDR-associated ABC transporters has also been reported for a variety
of redox indicators (i.e., dihydrorhodamine, MitoSOX, and dihydroethidium)
as well as other frequently used dyes (e.g., JC1 and Hoechst 33342).25 Underestimation of intracellular DCF levels
should therefore always be considered when DCFH2-DA is
used on MDR-associated ABC transporter-expressing cells, regardless
of whether the assay is coconducted with DCFH2.

Nevertheless,
general oxidative stress can be easily measured using
DCFH2 in tailored settings and conditions. Aside from the
relatively low cost of DCFH2-DA versus other redox probes,
the use of DCFH2 holds several important benefits. The
membrane-impermeability and consequent extracellular localization
of DCFH2 does not apply to most commercially available
fluorogenic redox probes such as membrane-transgressing dihydroethidium
and dihydrorhodamine.1 This is particularly
useful in light of having an intracellularly localizing, structurally
identical counterpart (i.e., DCFH2-DA). Although compartmentalized
analysis of redox processes has been reported,16,27 these studies used different probes for the measurement of intra-
and extracellular oxidant formation. Such approaches significantly
reduce comparability of the data while underscoring the significant
advantage of using DCFH2 in concert with DCFH2-DA. Moreover, DCFH2 does not require cofactors, as is
the case with, for example, Amplex Red1 and lucigenin,2 which may interfere with
probe reaction(s). Lastly, the high fluorescence quantum yield of
DCF (0.96 in PBS28 compared to, for example,
0.0091 for ethidium in H2O29) allows detection in the nanomolar range.

Conclusions
DCFH2 is an easy-to-prepare DCFH2-DA derivative
that enables a variety of innovative probe applications. These include
various cell-free assays in which DCFH2 can be employed
to analyze specific redox reactions. The simultaneous use of DCFH2-DA and DCFH2 moreover allows for the concomitant
detection of intra- and extracellular oxidative stress in vitro. Lastly,
the same method can be used to prepare CDCFH2 from CDCFH2-DA that, when encapsulated into a liposomal probe delivery
system, can be used for the detection of organ- or tissue-specific
oxidant formation in vivo.
