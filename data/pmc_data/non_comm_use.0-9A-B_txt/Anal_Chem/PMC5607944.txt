We
report a new pure-shift method, termed SHARPER (Sensitive, Homogeneous,
And Resolved PEaks in Real time) designed for the analysis of reactions
and equilibria by NMR. By focusing on a single selected signal, SHARPER
removes all heteronuclear couplings of a selected nucleus without
the need to pulse on X channels, thus overcoming hardware limitations
of conventional spectrometers. A more versatile decoupling scheme,
termed sel-SHARPER, removes all heteronuclear and
homonuclear couplings of the selected signal. Both methods are characterized
by a periodic inversion of the active spin during the real-time acquisition.
In addition to decoupling, they also compensate for pulse imperfections
and magnetic field inhomogeneity, generating an extremely narrow singlet
with a linewidth approaching limits dictated by the spin–spin
relaxation. The decoupling and line narrowing effected by (sel)-SHARPER provide significant increases in the signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio. Increases of 20-fold were routinely achieved for 19F detection. sel-SHARPER is also applicable
to first- and higher-order 1H spectra. The sensitivity
gains are substantially greater for inhomogeneous magnetic fields,
including dynamic inhomogeneity caused by gas sparging. The parameters
of the pulse sequences have been analyzed in detail to provide guidelines
for their most effective application. The considerable reduction in
the detection threshold induced by (sel)-SHARPER
make the technique particularly suited for in situ monitoring of reaction kinetics. The approach is illustrated by
a 19F NMR study of the protodeboronation of an aryl boronic
acid. Here, the high S/N allowed reliable determination of the net
protodeoboronation kinetics, and the excess line broadening of 19F singlets was utilized to characterize the boronic acid/boronate
equilibrium kinetics. Oxidation of diphenylphosphine, monitored by 31P NMR under optimized gas-flow conditions, demonstrated the
high tolerance of SHARPER to dynamic inhomogeneity. The principles
of the (sel)-SHARPER sequences are expected to find
numerous applications in the design of new NMR experiments.

==== Body
Solution-phase
NMR is an indispensable
tool for the in situ study of chemical reactions.
However, it is not necessary to acquire a complete spectrum: the temporal
concentration changes in reactants and/or products can be examined
by following one signal, or a subset of resonances, simultaneously
or sequentially, within the constraints presented by the reaction
lifetime. Herein, we report a new NMR pulse sequence that we term
SHARPER (Sensitive, Homogeneous, And Resolved PEaks in Real time; vide infra) designed for application within this framework.
SHARPER belongs to a family of pure-shift NMR techniques1−5 to which it brings considerable benefits. Not only does it collapse
multiplets to singlets, and substantially increases S/N, but it also
addresses limitations of standard pure-shift approaches, including
NMR hardware and magnetic field homogeneity requirements.

Pure-shift
NMR methods have been the subject of considerable attention
over the past few years due to their ability to significantly improve
resolution and potentially also the sensitivity of detection of high
natural abundance nuclei such as 1H or 19F.
Particularly relevant to reaction monitoring are the real-time pure-shift
methods6−9 that do not involve acquisition of multiple free induction decays
(FIDs) associated with the pseudo-2D Zangger and Sterk approach.10 The real-time pure-shift methods manipulate
spin systems during the directly detected acquisition period of NMR
experiments by periodically inverting the passive spins while effectively
leaving the spin states of the active spins unchanged. In practice,
such spin manipulation is achieved by two consecutive spin inversion
events, both of which are felt by the active, detected nuclei, whereas
only one is registered by the passive, coupled spins. The overall
360°/180° rotations experienced by these two spin groups
are therefore equivalent to application of 0°/180° pulses,
a treatment that removes all intergroup couplings while allowing the
chemical shift evolution of the active spins. The outcome is a pure-shift
spectrum of either all7 or a band-selected
group of resonances.9 The former methods
are general, but they often lead to a loss of signal. The band-selective
approach maintains all available magnetization and, by neglecting
relaxation effects and pulse imperfections, increases the signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio relative to a reference spectrum, albeit only for a subset
of signals. It is this aspect that is of particular interest to reaction
monitoring, where maximizing sensitivity can be highly beneficial.
Below, we present the design and implementation of a new pure-shift
method, explore its scope and limitations, and demonstrate its application
in the analysis of the kinetics of chemical reactions and equilibria
by 19F and 31P NMR.

Experimental Section
NMR Experiments
19F spectra were acquired
on a two-channel 400 MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped
with a Prodigy probe or on a three-channel 400 MHz Bruker Avance III
NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm z gradient BB TBO 1H, 19F probe. The 19F spectra of 1 in CDCl3 presented in Figure 2 were acquired using the following parameters:
relaxation and nominal acquisition times of 1.5 and 17.4 s, respectively,
with two dummy scans and four scans accumulated. The 19F SHARPER spectrum was acquired using the pulse sequence of Figure 1: 17 and 34 μs
90° and 180° pulses, respectively, n =
256, 34 ms chunk time, with an overall acquisition time per scan of
17.9 s.

Figure 1 Pulse sequences of the SHARPER experiment. Narrow and wide filled
rectangles represent 90° and 180° pulses, respectively.
RD stands for relaxation delay. 300 μs sine-shaped PFGs were
applied at G1 = 1% followed by a 200 μs gradient
recovery delay. The following phase cycle (minimum number of scans
is 2) was used: φ1 = 2x, 2(−x), 2y, 2(−y);
φ2 = 2(y,–y), 2(x,–x); φ3 = 2(−y,y), 2(−x,x); and ψ = 2x, 2(−x), 2y, 2(−y).

The 19F SHARPER
spectra of a mixture of 3 and 4 in a mixture
of 1:1 CD3OD/H2O presented in Figure 4 were acquired using the pulse
sequence of Figure 3: n = 128, 13.6 ms acquisition
chunks, 10 ms 180° sinc pulse during the initial single PFG spin–echo
(SPFGSE). Relaxation and nominal acquisition times of 10 and 3.49
s were used, respectively. Two dummy scans and four scans were accumulated.
The spectra were processed by applying a 0.1 Hz exponential line broadening
and a forward complex linear prediction (the stated signals half-height
linewidths quote values without this additional line broadening).
The 19F SHARPER spectra of Figure 5 were acquired using identical parameters
as those used for the spectra of Figure 4, but with the x, y, z, z2, z3, xy, xz,
and yz shim corrections deviating by +500 units from
their optimal values.

The 19F SHARPER spectra of 1 presented
in Figure 6 were acquired
using the pulse sequence of Figure 1. Relaxation and nominal acquisition times of 3 and
1.09 s were used, respectively. The loop parameter n was set to 64, 128, 256, or 512, yielding acquisition chunks of
8.5, 4.25, 2.13, and 1.06 ms; 70 μs 180o 19F
pulses were applied during acquisition. Two dummy scans and two scans
were accumulated. The spectra were processed by applying a 0.5 Hz
exponential line broadening (the half-height linewidths are quoted
without this additional line broadening). Gas sparging was applied
as described in the text.

Spectra of F-3 of 3 in
CD3OD/H2O (1:1 ratio) presented in Figure 7 were acquired using
the SHARPER pulse sequence of Figure 1: relaxation delay
of 3 s, acquisition time of 0.89 s, two dummy scans and two scans
accumulated, 125 μs 90° rectangular excitation pulse and
250 μs rectangular 180° pulses during the acquisition.
The length of 180° rectangular pulses was set to avoid perturbation
of the F-1 and F-4 spins. The acquisition chunk lengths varied between
0.845 and 3.38 ms. The spectra were processed using exponential line
broadening of 0.5 Hz (the half-height linewidths are quoted without
this additional line broadening). The 1D 19F spectra were
acquired using a 90° excitation pulse and parameters used for
the SHARPER spectra. Gas sparging was applied as described in the
text.

KOH catalyzed protodeboronation of 2/2a in
a 1:1 H2O/dioxane mixture was monitored by the acquisition
of 19F NMR sel-SHARPER spectra (pulse
sequence
of Figure 3, n = 128) in a stop-flow experiment (Figure 8). Two scans were acquired per spectrum using
a relaxation delay of 1.5 s and an overall acquisition time of 4.99
s per scan, which consisted of 2.18 s of sampling (acquisition chunk
time of 8.5 ms) and 2.81 s (10 ms Gaussian pulses, 300 μs pulsed
field gradients (PFGs), and 200 μs gradient recovery delays).
Two dummy scans were applied before the acquisition of the first spectrum
only. Sixteen spectra were acquired with the first and the last starting
13 and 208 s, respectively, after the mixing was triggered.

Spectra of 5/5a in a 1:1 H2O/dioxane mixture
presented in Figure 9 were acquired using the sel-SHARPER pulse sequence
of Figure 3: relaxation
delay of 3 s, acquisition time of 1.5 s, two dummy scans and four
scans accumulated, 93 μs 90° rectangular excitation pulse,
1 ms 180° Gaussian pulse during the SPFGSE, and 186 μs
rectangular 180° pulses during the acquisition. The length of
180° rectangular pulses was set to avoid perturbation of the
other fluorine spins. The chunk length was set to 23.4 ms. The 1D 19F spectra were acquired using a relaxation delay of 3 s,
an acquisition time of 0.87 s, two dummy scans, and eight scans. Samples
were prepared by mixing 500 μL of 0.1 M 5 containing
0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid with increasing amounts of 0.1 M 5 in 0.1 M KOH. In this way, the concentration of 5 was kept constant. The resulting concentrations of KOH, together
with obtained linewidths and chemical shifts, are reported in Table S4.

Line Shape Analysis
As indicated, the 5/5a exchange (eq 3) is fast on the chemical
shift scales (ka ≫ Δω,
where Δω = ΩA – ΩB and where ΩA and ΩB are the resonance
frequencies of spins in
sites A and B, respectively, in the absence of chemical exchange)
and also on the relaxation time scale (Δω ≫ ΔR2 and kex ≫
ΔR2, where ΔR2 = ΔR2B – ΔR2A, R2A and R2B are the relaxation rate constants for spins
in sites A and B, respectively, in the absence of chemical exchange,
and kex = ka + kb). Under these circumstances, the
relative site populations pA and pB (pA + pB = 1) satisfy the balance relationship pAkA = pBpB. If pA ≫ pB (or pB ≫ pA),
the transverse relaxation rate constant R2 of the population-averaged resonance line is given by eq 1, where R20 = pAR2A + pBR2B. The position of the observed
spectral line is given by eq 2 1   2  On the basis of the measured values of ΩA, ΩB, Ω, R2A, and R2B, values of pA and kex were calculated
using eqs 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion
Alternative Pure-Shift
Arrangements
In a pure-shift
method designed for reaction monitoring, the r.f. carrier is placed
on the chemical shift of a selected nucleus. This arrangement ultimately
produces an exponential FID with zero chemical shift modulation. Under
these circumstances, 180° pulses can be repeatedly applied to
the active spin. The effective 0°/180° rotation of the detected/coupled
protons, which is at the heart of broad-band decoupling of selected
signals during indirect11,12 or direct9,13 acquisition periods, can thus be replaced with a 180°/0°
element, maintaining all the attributes of a pure-shift methodology
while realizing additional benefits.

In its basic form, the
outlined pure-shift real-time experiment removes all heteronuclear
couplings of an isolated nucleus, e.g., 19F in a fluorinated
organic molecule, a motif common in contemporary medicinal chemistry.
The experiment consists of an acquisition interrupted by a periodic
application of nonselective 180° pulses surrounded by low-level
PFGs. As part of the repeating unit consisting of two such events,
the two pairs of PFGs are of equal strength but opposite polarity,
an arrangement that minimizes the disturbance of the static magnetic
field and the lock circuitry (Figure 1).

By maintaining a 90° phase difference
between the initial
90° excitation pulse and the subsequent 180° pulses, this
experiment possesses all of the attributes of the CPMG pulse sequence,14,15 compensating for static magnetic field inhomogeneity and pulse imperfections.

These properties have historically been used by Freeman and Hill16 for recording proton J-spectra.
Such spectra showed extremely narrow linewidths, reflecting the true T2 relaxation of protons. Freeman and Hill’s
experiment16 acquired a signal only at
the peaks of individual spin–echoes, where the effects of magnetic
field inhomogeneity are completely removed. In a different context,
a spin–echo applied during an indirectly detected dimension
of heterocorrelated experiments has been shown by Gochin et al.17 to remove signal broadening due to magnetic
field inhomogeneity. Remarkably, as illustrated below, a significant
line narrowing is maintained while relaxing the conditions applied
for J-spectra to allow acquisition of signal in “chunks”
of tens of milliseconds long, in a technique that we refer to as SHARPER.

Single Channel Heteronuclear Decoupling
The basic SHARPER
method, outlined in Figure 1, removes all heteronuclear splittings, effectively performing
broad-band heteronuclear decoupling without the need to pulse on X
nuclei. This property can be very beneficial when studying fluorinated
compounds, as the majority of NMR spectrometers, even the latest generation,
are not equipped to deliver both 1H and 19F
r.f. pulses during the same experiment; in other words, recording 19F{1H}9 or 1H{19F} spectra is rare. In addition, because SHARPER achieves
decoupling by pulsing on the detected rather than decoupled nuclei,
it simultaneously removes heteronuclear couplings of all X nuclei
present. For example, when observing 19F in a partially
deuterated compound, both 1H- and 2H-involving
couplings are removed, revealing the 19F{1H,2H} signal for the nucleus of interest. Analogously, using
SHARPER, 1H{19F} signals can be recorded using
highly sensitive inverse-detected triple-resonance cryoprobes, without
the requirement to pulse on 19F.

To illustrate the
performance of the basic pulse sequence, a 19F SHARPER
spectrum of fluorobenzene, 1, is presented in Figure 2. It is overlaid with a 1H-coupled 19F spectrum of 1 containing a single 19F resonance
as a triplet of triplets (9.1 and 5.8 Hz) due to the splitting by
pairs of chemically equivalent ortho and meta protons.

Figure 2 19F SHARPER
NMR spectrum (400 MHz) of fluorobenzene, 1, acquired
using the pulse sequence of Figure 1 and a 34 ms chunk time, overlaid with a 1H-coupled 19F spectrum of 1. The insets
show an FID and the SHARPER signal obtained with no apodization. The
position of the first side bands at 1000/34 = 29.41 Hz is indicated.
Full details are given in the Experimental Section.

The 19F SHARPER spectrum
of 1 contains
an extremely narrow singlet (half-height linewidth, Δ1/2 = 0.14 Hz) that has 8-fold the S/N of the central line of the 1H-coupled 19F multiplet. In this example, a deliberately
long chunk time of 34 ms was chosen to illustrate the robustness of
the method. The odd-numbered chunking artifacts at k/(2*chunk time) (k = 1, 3, 5, ...) frequencies are
largely suppressed by acquiring an initial half-chunk, while the side
bands at k/(1*chunk time) decay rapidly with increasing k. A systematic exploration of the effects of the chunk
length on the SHARPER spectra is presented later. The spectrum is
clean with a flat baseline, devoid of the artifacts typical for standard 19F spectra caused by the presence of a fluorinated material
in NMR probes. This feature is important for reliable signal integration
in the analysis of reaction kinetics.

Hetero- and Homonuclear
Decoupling
Minor modifications
(Figure 3) of the basic pulse sequence make it more versatile
and applicable to molecules with both hetero- and homonuclear couplings.
The first modification selects the signal of interest by replacing
the 90° excitation pulse with a single PFG spin–echo18 containing a selective 180° pulse surrounded
by two PFGs. The second modification involves the use of selective
inversion pulses during the acquisition. This can take the form of
a carefully adjusted 180° rectangular pulse, positioning signals
of coupled spins between the lobes of its sinc inversion profile,
or an arbitrary refocusing selective shaped pulse. Both approaches
are collectively referred to as selective SHARPER
or sel-SHARPER (Figure 3).

experiment.
The narrow filled rectangle represents a 90° nonselective pulse,
whereas open Gaussian shapes represent selective 180° pulses.
The description given in the caption to Figure 1 applies except for the phase cycling, which
is as follows: φ1 = 4x, 4(−x), 4y, 4(−y);
φ2 = 2y, 2x, 2(−y), 4(−x), 2y,
2x, 2(−y); φ3 = 4(y,–y), 4(x,–x); φ4 = 4(−y,y), 4(−x,x); and ψ = 2x, 4(−x), 2x, 2y, 4(−y), 2y (minimum number of scans is two).
G0 (1 ms) was applied at 30%.

The benefits of sel-SHARPER are illustrated
below
through the KOH catalyzed protodeboronation of fluorinated aryl boronic
acids.19,20 Protodeboronation of 2,3,6-trifluorophenyl
boronic acid 2, via boronate 2a, in a 1:1
mixture of deuterated methanol and H2O yields 1,3,4-trifluorobenzene 3 and its isotopologue 2-[2H]-1,3,4-trifluorobenzene 4 (Figure 4a). After complete consumption of 2, the 19F spectrum of the resulting mixture of 3 and 4 shows six 19F signals, split by numerous 19F–19F, 1H–19F, and 2H–19F couplings (4 only). These complex 19F multiplets are up to 50 Hz wide,
with 19F resonances from 3 and 4 separated by 1H/2H isotope shifts (Table S1 and Figure S1). Focusing on the F-1
signal of 4, a 1H,2H-coupled 19F spectrum (Figure 4a) and two 19F sel-SHARPER spectra
(Figure 4b,c) are compared.
The two sel-SHARPER spectra were acquired using a
10 ms sinc pulse during the initial SPFGSE selecting the signal of
F-1, whereas 205 μs 180° rectangular (Figure 4b) or 10 ms Gaussian pulses21 (Figure 4c) were applied during the acquisition, respectively. The
length of the rectangular pulses was adjusted to position the F-3
and F-4 resonances of 4 between the lobes of their sinc
inversion profile, to prevent the spin states of these nuclei from
changing. In both instances, the collapse of the F-1 multiplet in
the sel-SHARPER spectra delivers significant sensitivity
gains: the S/N is 20-fold greater than that in the 1H,2H-coupled 19F spectrum. The signal loss due to
real-time decoupling is small, with 82 and 73%, respectively, of the
integral intensities preserved in the two sel-SHARPER
spectra relative to the reference 1D spectrum. The insets in Figures 4, panels b and c,
show FIDs, where a more complete decay is seen when Gaussian pulses
were applied. This is mainly because the actual acquisition time has
almost doubled from the nominal value of 3.49 to 6.3 s, in this instance,
whereas only a modest increase to 3.79 s accompanied the use of rectangular
pulses. In both cases, the signals have not yet decayed to zero intensity.
The small increase in the linewidths, from Δ1/2 of
0.24 to 0.31 Hz, is thus caused by the additional relaxation during
the longer Gaussian pulses.

Line-Narrowing Properties of SHARPER
It can sometimes
be difficult to achieve or maintain perfect magnetic field homogeneity
when analyzing reactions in situ by NMR. Examples
include monitoring slow reactions in nondeuterated solvents without
autoshim, reactions taking place in multiphase environments, or reactions
that require or induce agitation, e.g., for gas–liquid phase
transfer or gas generation as a reaction evolves. To test the ability
of the SHARPER to improve analysis of reactions conducted in inhomogeneous
magnetic fields, the shim corrections were deliberately miss-set and
the sample of 3 + 4 was reacquired using
otherwise identical parameters. It can be see (Figure 5) that sel-SHARPER very efficiently compensates
for the magnetic field inhomogeneity, resulting only in a minor deterioration
of the quality of the spectra compared to samples run with ideal shims
(Figure 4). The intensities
of the main signal of F-1 of 4 dropped only by 18% with
an increase in linewidth of less than 0.04 Hz.

Figure 5 Overlay of 19F spectra as presented in Figure 4 but acquired in an inhomogeneous
magnetic field with x, y, z, z2, z3, xy, xz, and yz shim corrections offset by +500 units from their optimal values.
The 1H-coupled 19F spectrum (blue, scaled ×32)
and sel-SHARPER spectra used rectangular (green)
and Gaussian (brown) inversion pulses. The inset shows, left to right,
the F-1 signals from spectra of Figure 4b (violet) and 4c (black) and
the two corresponding signals acquired under miss-shimmed conditions.
Signal attributes (Δ1/2 and integral intensities)
are given relative to those presented in Figure 4. The values in parentheses belong to the
side band at −136.55 ppm labeled with an asterisk. Full details
are given in the Experimental Section.

The missing signal intensity in
the SHARPER singlet of 4 was directed toward the first
side band upnfield of the main signal,
where a fraction of the spins resonate; the downfield symmetrical
side band is absent. This observation suggests that a decreased chunk
time will better compensate for large magnetic field inhomogeneity
as this positions the side bands further away from the main resonance,
outside of the signal broadened by the magnetic field inhomogeneity.
The efficacy of this approach is illustrated in Figure S2. Careful inspection of the spectra presented in Figure S2 shows that the sum of the integrals
of the main peak and the side bands remains practically constant.
Hence, inclusion of side bands during quantitation is advisible if
a reduced chunk time is not desired (see discussion below).

A broad-band method for acquisition of pure-shift NMR spectra,
UPSIF (ultra-high-resolution pure shifts in inhomogeneous fields),
was recently reported.22 It generates high-resolution
1D and 2D spectra by sampling the intermolecular zero quantum coherences
between the solute and solvents during a constant-time indirect dimension,
producing impressive signal narrowing. This, however, comes at the
cost of sensitivity (up to 90%) and time (tens of FIDs are required
to reconstruct a single time point). The UPSIF method therefore is
suited to monitoring slower reactions and those where the amount of
material is not a limiting factor. It is also better suited for applications
where severe spectral overlap exists.

Gas Sparging
As
an example of the ability of SHARPER
to compensate for “dynamic” magnetic field inhomogeneity,
spectra of fluorobenzene 1 were recorded while nitrogen
was bubbled through the solution (Figure 6). Shorter chunk
times (i.e., shorter spin–echoes) are better able to restore
the line shape than longer ones: fluctuation of the magnetic field
inhomogeneity at time scales faster than the spin–echo times
cannot be compensated for. Even though the SHARPER singlets during
gas sparging are 10 times wider than those in regular samples, this
still represents an ∼8-fold increase in S/N compared to the
1D 19F spectrum acquired under the same conditions.

Figure 6 19F SHARPER spectra without (left) and with N2 sparging
(right) plotted on an identical vertical scale. 1H-coupled 19F 1D spectra of 1 obtained under
these conditions are also shown. The signal half-widths are stated
as a function of the chunk time. Full details are given in Experimental Section.

By using lower bubbling rates, we were able to obtain narrower
linewidths, but the signal intensities varied. When subsequently optimizing
the parameters with a view to following the reaction kinetics, N2 gas bubbling was found to impact the stability of the signal
integrals, although this occurred more so at relatively low bubbling
rates. When the N2 flow rate was maintained at about 180
mL/h to generate a dynamic bubble population of ∼1/cm (z-axis), the integrals became substantially more stable
(Figure S3).

The rationale behind
this observation is that at lower N2 flow rates there will
be instances where one or no bubble is present
in the active volume of the coil (approx 1.5 cm in length), whereas
at a higher N2 flow rate, two bubbles will always occur.
Even though displacement of solution from the active volume by the
gas bubbles reduces the number of spins contributing to the measured
signal, the integrals are more reliable. To demonstrate these effects,
SHARPER spectra were acquired focusing on the F-3 signal of 3. An overlay of 32 1D and SHARPER spectra acquired at two
bubbling rates (fast and slow) are presented in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Effect of the bubbling rate on the reproducibility of the SHARPER
spectra. Overlay of 32 1D and SHARPER 19F spectra showing
signal F-3 of 3 acquired at slow (left) and fast (middle)
bubbling rates. The linewidths and average signal integral, in reference
to 1D spectra acquired during the fast bubbling, are presented. A
snapshot indicating the distribution of N2 bubbles (∼1
bubble/cm, approximately 180 mL/h) is shown on the right. Full details
are given in the Supporting Information.

Inspection of the spectra showed
that (i) benefits of SHARPER are
largely preserved under significant gas flow (the linewidths only
increase from 0.5 Hz to <2.5 Hz), (ii) the signal integrals of
SHARPER spectra are reduced in comparison to 1D spectra integrals,
however, their scatter is smaller, (iii) as discussed above, better
reproducibility is achieved for gas flows that generate ∼1
bubble/cm (fast) compared to a ∼ 0.5 bubble/cm (slow) regime
(this is true for both 1D and SHARPER spectra), and (iv) lowering
the chunk time reduces the linewidths and scatter of the signal integrals
in the SHARPER spectra.

It should be noted that if one signal
needs to be selected during
the initial SPFGSE of the sel-SHARPER sequence (Figure 3), the duration of
the selective pulse and the strength and duration of PFGs should be
kept to a minimum; otherwise, the SPFGSE becomes a source of significant
signal losses and intensity variations due to intense convection.

As seen in the above examples, the interplay between the acquisition
chunk time and the experimental conditions are important for obtaining
high-quality SHARPER spectra. To assist users in achieving optimal
performance, the effects of the chunk length on the overall performance
of the SHARPER experiment were systematically explored. In addition,
the effects of frequency mismatch and pulse misscalibration were also
investigated. The findings are detailed in the Supporting Information, with only the main conclusions summarized
herein.

Factors Affecting SHARPER Spectra
The most important
factors are found to be the chunk length and the choice of method
for selective inversion of the active spin (for details, see Figures S4 and S5 and Tables S2 and S3). The
optimal setting depends on the nature of the investigated molecule,
its relaxation properties, and the complexity of its spectrum. While
short chunk times are generally beneficial, for couplings of <15
Hz, chunk lengths of tens of milliseconds are perfectly acceptable
and are even preferable when long selective inversion pulses are required
for spin inversion. These long pulses increase the effective spin–spin
relaxation, broadening the spectral lines. This is common to all band-selective
real-time pure shift methods;9,13 however, only SHARPER
compensates for magnetic field inhomogeneity through the CPMG scheme.
The band-selective methods effectively apply a 0° pulse to the
active nuclei between acquisition chunks and hence cannot act in a
similar manner. SHARPER signals will therefore always be narrower
under comparable circumstances. To maximize these benefits, it is
preferable to use carefully adjusted short rectangular 180° pulses
to avoid inversion of spins coupled to the observed spin. Noncoupled
spins can be inverted without affecting the outcome as they will have
already been eliminated by the initial SPFGSE that can be made highly
selective. These considerations are particularly important for crowded 1H spectra. As discussed above, when gas is bubbled through
the sample, short chunk times and short inversion pulse perform better.
It should be noted that the effect of magnetic field inhomogeneity
is reduced in spatially selective pure-shift experiments.23 These have been applied in reaction monitoring;
however, their sensitivity is much reduced due to spatial selection.

In the context of reaction monitoring, signals can change their
resonance frequency; e.g., when the pH of the medium changes with
conversion, phase separation takes place, or the magnetic field drifts
when experiments are performed on unlocked samples over a long period
of time. As SHARPER requires the r.f. pulses to be applied on resonance,
substantial drift of signals will have negative consequences. We have
demonstrated (see Figure S6) that SHARPER
can be used for quantitative analysis of reaction kinetics even when
signals are moving during monitoring, but it is essential to include
side bands in the data analysis. Short chunk times reduce the leakage
of the signal into side bands and are a necessity when larger movements
of resonances are anticipated. Similarly, as discussed above, inclusion
of side bands for quantitative evaluation is required when severe
magnetic field inhomogeneity is present. Alternatively, reduced chunk
times may push the side bands outside of the area of signal intensity.
Finally, the effect of pulse accuracy (or excessive B1 inhomogeneity)
on the quality of the SHARPER sequence was investigated (Figure S7). The results demonstrate remarkable
tolerance of SHARPER to pulse imperfections; nevertheless, pulse calibration
to an accuracy of ±10% is recommended to maximize the S/N and
the line shape quality.

Although SHARPER was applied above to 19F, there is
no fundamental difference when acquiring 1H SHARPER spectra,
as illustrated on an example of vincamine (Figure S8). This is particularly true for first-order multiplets and
X parts of the higher-order spin systems, such as the ABCX spin system
consisting of four aromatic vincamine protons (Figure S8b, panel A). When applied to the A part of an ABMRX
spin system of the same molecule, a 80 ms sinc pulse had to be used
in order not to invert proton B. This lead to a nonuniform inversion
of individual lines of this multiplet, which in combination with fast
relaxation of the CH2 protons decreased the signal intensity;
nevertheless, a singlet was produced (Figure S8c, panel B).

Reaction Monitoring and Chemical Exchange
As an example
of reaction monitoring using SHARPER, a time-course for protodeboronation19,20 of 2 (the reaction scheme is shown in the inset of Figure 4a) was recorded.
The reaction was initiated by a stop-flow system to effect fast and
efficient mixing of a solution of boronic acid 2 with
a solution of KOH, in dioxane/water. Separate sel-SHARPER experiments focused on each of the 19F signals
arising from reactant 2 and product 3 (see Figure S9). In the runs shown in Figure 8, the magnetic field was deliberately made nonhomogeneous,
as evidenced by the imperfect line shape of the trifluoroacetic acid
(see inset in Figure 8b) used as a pH stabilizer in the stock solution of 2. The signals arising from F-2 in 2, which convert to
F-3 in 3 via protodeboronation (kobs = 1.28 × 10–2 s–1), are intense and narrow. This stands in contrast to the very broad
multiplets observed in standard 1D 19F NMR spectra. The
numerous scalar couplings and line broadening by the magnetic field
inhomogeneity make extraction of the kinetic data significantly less
reliable than from sel-SHARPER spectra.

the reaction mixture and sel-SHARPER spectra of F-2
and F3. The inset in (b) shows the signal of trifluoracetic acid,
indicating poor magnetic field homogeneity. (c, d) Intensity changes
over 3.5 min. The Δ1/2 values are indicated. Full
details are given in the Experimental Section.

All of the 19F signals
in the reaction product (1,3,4-trifluorobenzene 3) were
sharp (Δ1/2 = 0.5 Hz). However, the 19F signals of reactant 2 were notably broader,
with linewidths that ranged from 1.6 to 3.5 Hz, depending on the position
of the 19F nuclei relative to the boron center (C1). The
(sel)-SHARPER sequence does not compensate for relaxation
caused by fast chemical exchange. Hence, excess line broadening (i.e.,
Δ1/2 > 0.5 Hz) can be interpreted in terms of
dynamics
associated with underlying equilibrium processes. In the case of 2, this involves rapid, pH-dependent interconversion of 2 with a 2,3,6-trifluorophenyl trihydroxy boronate anion, 2a (see inset to Figure 4a), a key intermediate in the protodeboronation process.19 The extent of excess line broadening depends
on (i) the rate of equilibration, (ii) the chemical shift differences
between the two exchanging 19F sites, and (iii) the equilibrium
population of 2 versus 2a, as dictated by
pH, or [OH]−.

Analogous excess line broadening
is observed with 2,4-difluorophenyl
boronic acid, 5 (Figure 9), which undergoes
much slower protodeboronation than 2 (krel ≤ 10–5). This feature allowed
a much more detailed analysis of the dynamics between reactant 5 and reaction intermediate 5a. As with 2/2a, only one signal is observed for each fluorine
nucleus due to the fast exchange between 5 and 5a on the NMR time scale. When superstoichiometric OH– is added, the signals sharpen as the proportion of 5a approaches 100% (see the F-2 signals in Figure 9).

shown in the inset. The Δ1/2 values, determined as
explained in the text, are indicated for the
first and last titration points using increasing KOH concentration.

Ishihara24 has studied the boric acid
(A)–borate (B) equilibrium (eq 3) in detail by 11B NMR. It was shown that ka increases linearly with [OH–], approaching a constant value: ka = k2cT, when [OH–] ≫Kb (where cT = cA + cB, the total boron concentration; and Kb is the basicity constant of the borate, B).
Thus, NMR analysis of the apparent exchange rate (eq 3) at known cT allows determination of k2 (M–1 s–1), the intermolecular rate constant
for degenerate OH– exchange between pairs of boric
and borate reactants (eq 4). 3   4  When applied to our system, A, A* and B, B*
are 5 and 5a, respectively. To determine k2, we analyzed 19F sel-SHARPER and 1D 19F spectra of a series of 5/5a samples (cT = 0.1 M)
containing 0.1–1.7 equiv of exogenous OH–. The excess line broadening was determined from the measured linewidths
of the sel-SHARPER spectra or by matching the signals
in 1D spectra with those generated by applying an appropriate line
broadening to the spectrum of 5a measured at larger excess
of OH–. Comparison of the methods revealed that
the Δ1/2 values obtained by SHARPER are systematically
larger, by factors of 1.069 for F-2 and 1.062 for F-4. This increase
is due to additional relaxation occurring during the PFGs and 180°
pulses applied between the acquisition chunks of the SHARPER acquisition
period. When tchunk ≫ δ(PFG+pulses), a linear approximation can be used to calculate
a linewidth correction factor (eq 5; Figure S10). 5  For our experimental setting,
this factor
is 1/1.06, which is in a very good agreement with the average determined
values of 1/1.066. After correction of the Δ1/2 values, eqs 1 and 2,25 given in the Experimental
Section, were used to analyze the data (Table S4). For F-2, the population of A (i.e., 5), pA, varied between 0.022 and 0.167,
yielding kex = 132 000 ± 13 500
and 134 000 ± 16 000 s–1, as
an average of 11 measurements, for SHARPER and 1D 19F spectra,
respectively. For F-4, pA varied between
0.018 and 0.150, yielding kex = 146 000
± 6800 and 149 000 ± 8200 s–1 for
SHARPER and 1D 19F spectra, respectively (Figure S11). As eqs 1 and 2 are valid only when there is
very large excess of either A or B (i.e., 5 or 5a), we simulated a two-site exchange process according to
the expressions derived by Rogers and Woodbrey26 (Figure S12). Using experimental
values of Δω for F-2 (1061 Hz) and F-4 (3552 Hz), with pA ranging from 0.001 to 0.16 and kex between 110 000 and 145 000 s–1, allowed determination of Ω and R2. These were then used to calculate kex, according to eqs 1 and 2. The values for kex obtained in this way showed relative standard deviations
between 1 and 3% (data not shown) across the stated pA range, indicating that the use of eqs 1 and 2 is justified.

The observed differences between the F-2 and F-4 based kex values therefore are not a consequence of
the choice of data interpretation formalism. They arise because the
observed positions of the spectra lines are affected not only by the
exchange but also by additional factors such as changing pH (see the Supporting Information for a full discussion).
Despite the observation that the kex values
differ slightly depending on which of the two sites (F-2 versus F-4)
is analyzed, the rate determined for degenerate intermolecular OH
transfer between 5 and 5a (k2 = 1.3 ± 0.2 × 106 M–1 s–1) compares well with those reported by Ishihara
for boric acid/borate (k2 = 2.6 ×
106 M–1 s–1)24 and for methylboronic acid/methylboronate (k2 = 0.70 × 106 M–1 s–1).27

Oxidation of
Diphenylphosphine
To demonstrate the performance
of SHARPER in reaction monitoring under gas-flow conditions, the aerobic
oxidation of diphenylphosphine, 6, to diphenylphosphine
oxide, 7, was followed in toluene-d8. This example also demonstrates the ability of SHARPER to
decouple large heteronuclear coupling constants (1JPH of 215.9 Hz in this case). Such large coupling
required a reduction in the chunk time to around 1 ms to maximize
the benefits of SHARPER (see Figure S13). Short chunk times are also required to minimize the effects of
gas bubbles. Figure 10 shows integral intensities of the 31P signal of 6 during the oxidation, including
examples of spectra. The original data are presented in Figure S14. It can be seen that the SHARPER signals
show smaller immediate fluctuation of integral intensities, narrow
linewidths, and a significantly larger S/N ratio (despite the overall
drop of integral intensities of ∼40% relative to the 1D spectra).
These attributes of the SHARPER pulse sequence make it a useful tool
for monitoring chemical reactions under challenging conditions of
gas sparging.

Figure 10 Integral intensities
of the 31P signal of 6 during aerobic oxidation
induced by air sparging. The initial points
correspond to 1D 31P spectra, and the latter correspond
to the sel-SHARPER spectra. The spectra, plotted
on the same scale and acquired at the changeover point of the monitoring
method, are shown together with their attributes. Full details are
given in Figure S14.

Conclusions
A simple and robust pure-shift NMR method,
termed SHARPER, has
been developed, and its parameters were analyzed in detail to provide
guidelines for its most effective application to 19F, 1H, and 31P. SHARPER effects hetero- and homonuclear
decoupling of all nuclei without the need to pulse on the X channel,
yielding significant improvements in achievable S/N ratio. It is also
insensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity, either static or, within
certain limits, dynamic inhomogeneity, making it a valuable tool for
quantitative monitoring of chemical reactions and parameters of chemical
exchange in challenging environments. These attributes were exemplified
by several examples, included protodeboronation of polyfluorinated
aryl boronic acids, an investigation of a very fast accompanying boronic
acid/boronate equilibrium, and oxidation of diphenylphosphine induced
by intense air bubbling.

It is worth noting that, depending
on the exchange parameters and
within the constraints of the J removal requirements
of the SHARPER experiments, it may be possible explore the effects
of varying CPMG frequency by changing the chunk time. In this way,
much slower dynamics can be studied as demonstrated in relaxation
dispersion experiments.28 The SHARPER methodology
will also find applications outside of reaction monitoring, e.g.,
a simple modification of the pulse sequence offers a direct route
toward accurate measurement of small homo- and heteronuclear scalar
and dipolar coupling constants The SHARPER building block is expected
to be applied in other branches of NMR, e.g., in vivo spectroscopy or MRI, and thus to play a role beyond improving the
S/N ratio of high-resolution NMR spectra of high-abundance spins.
SHARPER also provides a direct avenue for dealing with inherently
poor magnetic field homogeneity of the upcoming benchtop NMR spectrometers,
where the sensitivity gains are expected to be substantial.
