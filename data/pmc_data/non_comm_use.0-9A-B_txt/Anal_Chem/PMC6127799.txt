Reactions
in confined compartments like charged microdroplets are of increasing
interest, notably because of their substantially increased reaction
rates. When combined with ambient ionization mass spectrometry (MS),
reactions in charged microdroplets can be used to improve the detection
of analytes or to study the molecular details of the reactions in
real time. Here, we introduce a reactive laser ablation electrospray
ionization (reactive LAESI) time-resolved mass spectrometry (TRMS)
method to perform and study reactions in charged microdroplets. We
demonstrate this approach with a class of reactions new to reactive
ambient ionization MS: so-called click chemistry reactions. Click
reactions are high-yielding reactions with a high atom efficiency,
and are currently drawing significant attention from fields ranging
from bioconjugation to polymer modification. Although click reactions
are typically at least moderately fast (time scale of minutes to a
few hours), in a reactive LAESI approach a substantial increase of
reaction time is required for these reactions to occur. This increase
was achieved using microdroplet chemistry and followed by MS using
the insertion of a reaction tube—up to 1 m in length—between
the LAESI source and the MS inlet, leading to near complete conversions
due to significantly extended microdroplet lifetime. This novel approach
allowed for the collection of kinetic data for a model (strain-promoted)
click reaction between a substituted tetrazine and a strained alkyne
and showed in addition excellent instrument stability, improved sensitivity,
and applicability to other click reactions. Finally, the methodology
was also demonstrated in a mass spectrometry imaging setting to show
its feasibility in future imaging experiments.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
(MS), stand-alone or hyphenated with separation techniques like chromatography
or electrophoresis, is a well-established analysis technique in industry,
healthcare, and many fields of science, such as organic synthesis,1 metabolomics,2 and
proteomics.3 The abundant use of MS and
its hyphenations is mainly due to the combination of high sensitivity,
selectivity, speed, and capabilities for structure elucidation by
MSn. MS can also be optimized to study
molecular reactions in solution.4 Time-resolved
mass spectrometry (TRMS), where reaction vessels are directly coupled
with MS analyses, was first introduced by Lee et al. in 1989.5 TRMS is used to study dynamic processes in which
reagents convert into (by-)products in real time, typically in the
microsecond to minute time range.6−12 The development and use of TRMS has been reviewed recently by Lento
and Wilson.13

The discovery of reaction
acceleration in charged microdroplets, even up to 6 orders of magnitude,14 by the Cooks and Zare groups brings a new way
to perform and study a wide range of (bio)molecular reactions.15,16 It has been used in organic synthesis,17−20 in order to predict the likely
success of up-scaling reactions,21 and
as a continuous synthesis system.22 Other
exciting fields of application are its use to study the chemistry
of life,23 which mostly takes place in
small enclosed volumes such as cells or atmospheric aerosols,24−26 or to improve detection of analytes in ambient ionization MS.27−32 Several explanations have been suggested why reaction acceleration
in charged microdroplets may occur: partial desolvation of reagents
at the droplet-to-air interface,32−37 pH change,38 and/or a potentially increased
reagent concentration associated with solvent evaporation.20

The combination of TRMS and charged microdroplets
can also be used to determine reaction kinetics, provided that reaction
times can be accurately measured. Previously, reaction times with
electrospray ionization (ESI) over distances up to 100 cm were estimations
based on approximate droplet flight time, assuming that droplets are
carried along by the nebulizing gas.39 Further
steps have been taken to record reaction time with desorption electrospray
ionization (DESI)40 and microdroplet fusion
in extractive electrospray ionization (EESI)41 by using Doppler techniques to measure the droplet velocity on the
microsecond time scale.42,43 With DESI the droplet
velocity was decreasing quickly with distance due to aerodynamic drag.42 With EESI, pressurized nebulizing nitrogen gas
was used as a propulsive force providing more stable average velocities
before reaching the MS.43 The reaction
is essentially stopped when the droplets reach the vacuum of the heated
MS interface.39 Up to now, a direct way
to measure reaction time over distances up to 100 cm has, to our knowledge,
not been described.

Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI)
MS provides a way to analyze a wide range of samples, including liquids,44,45 solid materials,46 tissue,47−51 and single cells52−54, under ambient conditions.55 In LAESI, a pulsed laser directed onto a substrate produces a neutral
plume of ablated material, which can be extracted with charged microdroplets
produced by an electrospray probe for subsequent analyte ionization.
When the electrospray solution contains a reagent, LAESI can be used
to perform reactions with the ablated compounds in charged microdroplets.
A combination with TRMS would enable the determination of reaction
kinetics. Alternatively, the reaction could be used to generate chemical
derivatives of the ablated compounds to improve the detection of analytes
in ambient ionization MS. So far, mainly reactive DESI has been used
in order to improve analyte detection by increased proton affinity,28−32 adapted analyte mass-to-charge (m/z) value,56−60 altered polarity,61−63 or as a tool for structure elucidation.64 Apart from DESI also a few other reactive ambient
ionization techniques have been reported.65−69 Potentially, similar reagents can also be used in
a reactive LAESI system. In current literature, however, reactive
LAESI exclusively refers to coordination complexes with metal salts
like lithium or silver in order to achieve cationization.70,71 A reason why common DESI reactions have not been reported for LAESI
could be the relatively short reaction time window available in LAESI.
For a comparable extractive electrospray ionization setup, the reaction
time was stated to be in the order of only 15 μs.43 Thus, a major challenge for molecular reactions
in ambient ionization LAESI MS is to significantly increase the reaction
time. One possibility to achieve this is the introduction of a reaction
tube, as previously used in an ESI study of a Hantzsch reaction.39 However, for introduction of a reaction tube
into a reactive LAESI setting additional space needs to be available
between the electrospray probe and reaction tube in order to allow
the laser to irradiate the sample, ablate the material, and subsequently
extract the plume by electrospray-generated charged microdroplets.
In this experimental setup, temporal resolution can then be obtained
in a direct and precise fashion by the time difference between the
laser pulse and the MS detection of analytes or reaction products.

In the present work we report a novel ambient ionization MS approach,
viz., reactive LAESI in combination with accurate reaction time determination.
The method is demonstrated with an inverse electron demand Diels–Alder
addition (IEDDA)—click—reaction between substituted
tetrazines and a strained alkyne or alkene to form a stable pyridazine
product. As a result of the insertion of a reaction tube, the (charged)
microdroplet lifetime, and thus reaction time, was increased up to
4–5 orders of magnitude. Two new chemical bonds are formed
in this reaction, underlining the progress versus the cationization
LAESI experiments mentioned above. Click reactions are drawing significant
attention from different fields such as labeling of biomolecules for
imaging,72,73 bioconjugation,74−77 and polymer modification,78 due to the high efficiency.79,80 Our reactive LAESI methodology successfully showed pseudo-first-order
kinetic data of a model click reaction system between BCN-amine 1 and dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a, whereas TCO-amine 4 and other tetrazines performed equally well (structures
provided in Figure 1). Finally, the feasibility of reactive LAESI mass spectrometry imaging
(MSI) was demonstrated by exploiting the combined potential of laser
spatial resolution and microdroplet-induced reaction acceleration.

reactions between an amine-terminated strained (A) cyclooctyne (BCN-amine; 1) or (B) cyclooctene (TCO-amine; 4) and disubstituted
tetrazines 2 which feature different polarities (dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a, clofentezine 2b, diphenyl-tetrazine 2c). The [4 + 2] cycloaddition initially forms a strained
bicyclic reaction intermediate that is converted upon release of N2 into the pyridazine 3 or dihydropyridazine 5 click reaction product.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ultrapure water (H2O), 18.2 MΩ cm–1 at 25 °C, was
freshly produced daily with a Millipore (Molsheim, France) Integral
3 system. Methanol (MeOH), LC–MS grade, was purchased from
VWR (Leuven, Belgium). N-[(1R,8S,9s)-Bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-yn-9-ylmethyloxycarbonyl]-1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane

(clofentezine, 2b), 3,6-diphenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (diphenyl-tetrazine, 2c), reserpine, and 96-well plates (untreated) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Chemical structures
of reagents are given in Figure 1. All chemicals were used without further purification.

Experimental Setup and Measurement of Reaction Time
A Protea
Biosciences (Morgantown, WV) LAESI DP-1000 system was electronically
connected to a Waters (Manchester, U.K.) Synapt G2-S traveling wave
ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and used for all analyses.
The distance between the LAESI source and the MS inlet was varied
between 1 and 100 cm (see Figure 2A). Transport of ions from the LAESI ionization source
to the MS inlet was assisted by nitrogen as electrospray nebulizer
gas, controlled at 1 L min–1 by a Bronkhorst (Veenendaal,
The Netherlands) Mani-Flow mass flow controller, directed toward the
inlet of a grounded copper reaction tube of 1–100 cm length
and internal diameter of 1.0 cm (Gamma, The Netherlands) at room temperature.
The nebulizer gas flow was optimized for 50 cm reaction tube length.
Distances between the ESI to the reaction tube and the reaction tube
to the MS inlet, both under ambient conditions, were 18 and 20 mm,
respectively. A picture of the experimental setup is shown in Figure S1. LAESI desktop software v.2.0.1.3 (Protea
Biosciences) was used to control experimental parameters of the LAESI
system. The Nd:YAG optical parametric oscillator mid-infrared laser
(2.94 μm) was set to 100% laser power (Φ 3.2 J/cm2), and 10 pulses with a specified pulse length of 5 ns were
acquired on every spot on the 96-well plate at a frequency of 10 Hz.
The 96-well plate contained 383 μL of 100 μM dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a in MeOH–H2O (1:1) per well, and the temperature-controlled
sample stage was cooled to 4 °C to avoid evaporation during analysis.
A solution of 100 μM BCN-amine 1 in MeOH–H2O (1:1) was used as electrospray solvent at a flow rate of
5 μL/min. Electrospray voltage was set at ∼3.5 kV in
order to have a stable Taylor cone. The Synapt G2-S was controlled
by MassLynx v4.1 SCN 883 (Waters) and operated in positive-ion time-of-flight
(TOF)-MS resolution mode, m/z range
of 50–1200 Da, scan time of 0.1 s, source and interface temperatures
both set at 120 °C, sample cone 20 V, source offset 60 V, automated
detector check off, pDRE lens 99.80%, and detector value set to an
additional +100 V. In addition, the trap gas was switched from default
argon to nitrogen operated at a flow rate of 2 mL/min, the helium
cell dc was set to 0.0 V, and the trap and transfer collision energies
were at 1.0 V to reduce any ion fragmentation in the mass spectrometer.
Reaction time Δt was specified as the time
difference between the analog signal of the laser pulse and the first
mass spectrometric detection event of the reaction product 3a (Figure 2B). Different
reaction tube lengths, 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 cm, were used to obtain
different reaction times. The y-axis cutoff in the
measurement of reaction time graphs (Figure 2C and Figure S2) was set to Δt = 0.10 s in order to allow
exponential fitting. In subsequent calculations on reaction time the
added value of Δt = 0.10 s was subtracted.
Where relevant in figures, the standard deviation of averaged data
is provided as error bars.

tube length (n = 2).

Determination of Reaction Kinetics
The experiments that
were used to determine the reaction time—described in the previous
section—were optimized to achieve maximum temporal resolution,
at the cost of signal intensity, with a short MS scan time and few
laser pulses per analysis location. The reaction kinetics experiments
required larger peak areas for data processing and were optimized
for improved signal intensity. For this reason a few acquisition parameters
were adjusted from the previous section. The MS scan time was set
at 1 s, and 75 laser pulses were used per analysis location to obtain
significant reaction product peak areas for reliable integration in
the extracted ion currents (EIC) obtained. Reaction time data were
now simply calculated for reaction tube lengths of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, and 100 cm, using the exponential fit (y = 0.101e0.017x) of the calibration
plot given in Figure 2C. Raw MS data were processed to yield EICs with a 15 ppm window.
These ion currents were mean-smoothed (number of smooths was 1, with
a window size of 2 scans) and integrated to obtain laser pulse based
peak areas. With the kinetic data (as presented in Figure 4, n = 3),
one outlier at time 19 ms was removed before averaging with a Grubbs’
test based on residuals from the regression line (95% CI, 10 DF).
Background-subtracted mass spectra were created using the “combine
spectrum” function in MassLynx: five scans, each corresponding
to 10 laser pulses were averaged, and 50 scans of the electrospray
background were subtracted.

Reactive LAESI Mass Spectrometry Imaging
of the Wageningen University (WUR) Logo
For mass spectrometry
imaging the same experimental conditions were used as described in
the Determination of Reaction Kinetics section,
with a few changes. The reaction tube length was fixed at 50 cm, MS
inlet and source temperatures were at 150 °C, 20 laser pulses
were used per x–y position
with a between location dwell time of 0 s, and the LAESI sample stage
was cooled further down to −19 °C to keep the sample frozen
during the experiment. Reactive LAESI data were acquired from a 61
× 41 pattern (2501 sample locations)—laser spot size approximately
200 μm, in-between spot interval 500 μm—in a sampling
area defined from an optical image, resulting in a total analysis
time of 180 min. The sample was created by depositing 200 μL
of a 1 mM dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a solution in H2O on the hydrophilic part (in the shape of the Wageningen University
logo) of an otherwise hydrophobic surface. The sample was then stored
in a freezer at −18 °C for 30 min in order to freeze the
aqueous solution prior to MSI analysis.

Safety Precautions
Safety precaution: since the metal reaction tube is in close proximity
with the electrospray needle (∼3.5 kV), there is risk of electric
discharge when not either decently grounded or covered by a nonconductive
material. In addition, the open gap between the reaction tube and
the MS inlet could contain solvent vapor; thus, a suction hood is
required to remove any harmful solvent vapors that are not sucked
into the MS inlet. Finally, there is an open heated MS inlet, which
constitutes a potential temperature hazard.

Results and Discussion
Measurement
of Click Reaction Time
In order to study the reaction time
in the click reaction between strained alkyne 1 and tetrazine 2a, the following setup was made. A pulsed mid-IR laser (2.94
μm) was used to ablate a dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a solution. The ablation plumes were continuously extracted with orthogonally
directed electrospray microdroplets containing BCN-amine 1 reagent. This aerosol is carried along with nebulizer gas through
a metal tube before MS detection. To obtain different reaction times,
several metal tubes of different lengths (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 cm)
were used. A schematic overview is presented in Figure 2A, and an image of the setup is shown Figure S1. The time difference between the laser
pulse and the MS detection of product 3a (Figure 2B) is plotted against increasing
tube lengths in Figure 2C. After an initial relatively high linear gas velocity due to the
small diameter of nebulizer gas outlet, the velocity is rapidly decreasing,
which yields for this range of tube lengths a near-exponential dependence
of reaction times on reaction tube length (R2 = 0.999). This correlation could therefore be used as a calibration
curve for other tube lengths up to 100 cm. The electrical voltage
offset between the MS inlet and grounded tube was varied to investigate
whether charge attraction/repulsion would affect the reaction time;
yet, no significant effect was observed (Figure S2).

Figure 3A presents a background-subtracted mass spectrum for the reaction
between BCN-amine 1 and dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a after 140 ms of reaction time. Three m/z values are observed: protonated dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a at m/z 237.086, protonated
product 3a at m/z 533.289,
and m/z 495.148, which corresponds
to the sodium adduct of dipyridyl-tetrazine dimer. In order to further
demonstrate this methodology, a different click reaction dienophile,
TCO-amine 4, was also used as electrospray additive for
the reaction with dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a. The obtained
background-subtracted mass spectrum is shown in Figure 3B. Like Figure 3A, both protonated dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a and its sodium adduct dimer were detected at m/z 237.089 and 495.146, respectively. The reaction
product 5a is detected at m/z 435.254, demonstrating the formation of covalently bonded
reaction products in reactive LAESI MS. Furthermore, m/z value 317.173 was obtained, which is likely to
be formed by elimination of the R2 group of structure 5 in Figure 1; the proposed structure is presented in Figure S3 (note: the truncated R2 group is already present
in 4 as an impurity, see Figure S4). Any effect of the nature of the metal from the reaction tube on
the reaction was briefly examined by using both copper and stainless
steel tubes, and no difference in reaction was observed (Figure S5).

Figure 3 Background-subtracted reactive LAESI mass
spectra of the click reaction products between (A) BCN-amine 1 and dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a and (B) TCO-amine 4 and dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a, following the setup
as depicted in Figure 2 (tube length = 50 cm).

When Figure 3A and Figure S5B are compared, a few differences
stand out: in Figure 3A both tetrazine 2a and its dimer are well-depicted
as a result of the relatively high (1 mM) tetrazine 2a concentration, whereas in Figure S5B (100
μM tetrazine 2a concentration) m/z value 561.296 is observed; this ion was found
to be an adduct between both click reagents (Figure S6), likely due to H-bonding between the protonated amine on 1 and the pyridine ring on 2a. m/z 561.296 is absent in Figure 3A due to the higher MS source temperature
used (150 °C instead of 120 °C), effectively breaking the
supposed H-bond prior to mass analysis.

Finally, the solvent
droplet lifetime over the 0.5 s (100 cm) experimental time frame was
indirectly investigated by following the area ratio between reaction
product 3a and its [3a + H2O]
adduct ions. Tabulating these ratios for multiple tube lengths (Table S7) results in a steady ratio increase
corresponding with increasing tube length. This data suggests gradual
droplet evaporation inside our reaction tube, but the microdroplets
do not seem to completely evaporate even at distances up to 100 cm,
as the H2O adduct is still detected here (Figure S8). This is in accordance with earlier reported results
by Lee et al.,43 where the evaporation
of water microdroplets produced by an electrospray probe was found
to be negligible, although in a much shorter time frame of 50 μs.

Determination of Model Click Reaction System Kinetics
Following
the time measurements and detection of click reaction products 3a and 5a, which are both only possible due to
the insertion of a reaction tube, the TRMS method was used to study
the IEDDA reaction kinetics in charged microdroplets under pseudo-first-order
conditions. The latter was achieved with an excess of BCN-amine 1, as the concentration in the electrospray microdroplets
is much larger than the dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a in the
ablated liquid solution (Figure S9). Reserpine
was added as internal standard to the dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a solution in order to correct for possible ablation variation and
any bias caused by changing the distance between the electrospray
source and MS inlet via stepwise variation of the reaction tube length
(13 different tube lengths were used). The product 3a formation over time is presented in Figure 4, from which the
pseudo-first-order rate constant for the IEDDA reaction was determined
to be 28 s–1. One additional interesting finding
was that the absolute peak areas of both click reaction product 3a and the used standard reserpine were surprisingly stable
over reaction tube lengths longer than 15 cm, indicating that almost
no signal was lost upon increasing the reaction tube length even up
to 1 m, corresponding to a 0.5 s reaction time (Figure S10).

Figure 4 Graph of the formation of click reaction product 3a in relation to reaction time (n = 3) following
insertion of 13 different reaction tube lengths (0–100 cm)
for the model reaction between BCN-amine 1 and dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a. Inserted is the graph with the ln of data points up to
60 ms.

The second-order rate constant k2 is then derived as 28 s–1/0.10 mM = 2.8 × 105 M–1 s–1. The analogous reaction between dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a and BCN–OH performed in methanol solution was reported
in various studies to have a k2 of typically
102 M–1 s–1.74,75 The current reaction in charged microdroplets is at least 2 orders
of magnitude faster than the similar click reaction in bulk solvents.
It has been reported that the addition of water as cosolvent (55:45
MeOH–H2O) increases the rate constant due to hydrogen
bonding with tetrazine, which reduces the highest occupied molecular
orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO)
gap.76 The effect of a decreasing pH could
also contribute to the increased reaction rate because of possible
protonation of the pyridine ring, thus increasing its electron-withdrawing
properties and concomitantly speeding up the reaction. Finally, evaporation
of solvent molecules could also cause the reaction rate to increase
as a result of increasing concentration; however, solvent droplets
do not seem to fully evaporate before entering the vacuum of the MS
inlet, as discussed above. It is therefore likely that the observed
reaction acceleration is due to a combination of effects originating
from the charged microdroplet environment, as discussed by Yan et
al.81

Reactive LAESI Robustness
and Scope
The robustness of the methodology and its application
to various tetrazines with different polarities was briefly investigated
using clofentezine 2b and diphenyl-tetrazine 2c. For this, four rows of a 96-well plate were filled with different
tetrazine solutions per row; from row A to D: blank, dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a, clofentezine 2b, and diphenyl-tetrazine 2c, all 1 mM in MeOH–H2O (95:5). Subsequently,
the analysis was run starting at row A and followed a typewriter pattern
to end in row D. Unprocessed EICs and the analog signal of the laser-pulsed
injection of tetrazines are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Reactive LAESI MS extracted ion currents of
the click reaction products of 1 with (A) diphenyl-tetrazine 3c (m/z 531.297), (B) clofentezine 3b (m/z 599.219), and (C)
dipyridyl-tetrazine 3a (m/z 533.287). Corresponding background-subtracted mass spectra are given
in Figure S11, parts A and B, and Figure 3A, respectively.
In addition, the analog signal of the laser pulses is displayed (D).
The reaction tube length was 50 cm.

In the blank, at 1–4 min, no signal was obtained in
the EIC of any BCN-amine 1–tetrazine products.
The click reaction product ions of diphenyl-tetrazine 3c (Figure 5A), clofentezine 3b (Figure 5B), and dipyridyl-tetrazine 3a (Figure 5C) were in excellent agreement with the time
frame of the analog signal of ablation from the corresponding tetrazine.
Although not studied, other (asymmetrical) tetrazines are expected
to work as well. The EICs in Figure 5 also demonstrate that well-to-well signal intensity
stability is at least equal to or even better than that of conventional
LAESI experiments (Figure S12), showing
that ambient mass spectrometry imaging with reactive LAESI would be
realistic.

Thanks to reactive LAESI, the sensitivity could be
increased because of a higher ionization efficiency of the click reaction
product 3a in comparison with dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a. This effect of increased sensitivity combined with indications
of the scope of reactive LAESI are shown in Figure 6, for which dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a was dissolved in both H2O and in 10 times diluted soft
drink (cola) at a concentration of 100 μM and analyzed with
(Figure 6A) and without
(Figure 6B) BCN-amine 1 in the ESI spray solution. As a result, the click reaction
product 3a could still be detected in diluted cola, whereas
unreacted dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a got lost in the background.

Figure 6 Reactive
LAESI extracted ion currents of two separate analyses of a 100 μM
dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a solution in H2O and
in 10 times diluted cola. Analysis A was with BCN-amine 1 in the electrospray solution and depicts the pyridazine product 3a (m/z 533.287) at all
times. Analysis B was without BCN-amine 1 in the electrospray
solution and shows dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a (m/z 237.088) in a water environment but not in cola.

Reactive LAESI Mass Spectrometry
Imaging
Finally, preliminary reactive LAESI mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI) experiments were conducted on a dipyridyl-tetrazine 2a solution which was deposited—and subsequently frozen—onto
a hydrophilic surface area in the shape of the Wageningen University
logo (Figure S13; size 20 mm × 29
mm). An image was created by plotting the absolute intensity of the
protonated click reaction product 3a according to laser
ablation x–y coordinates.
The resulting 2D ion map nicely correlates with the sample (Figure 7), showing the potential
to map the presence of compounds onto a surface using reactive LAESI
MSI.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a novel ambient ionization time-resolved
mass spectrometry method for performing and studying reactions in
charged microdroplets. For this we developed a setup to allow the
first reactive LAESI analysis with covalent bond-forming (click) reactions.
The observation of the click reaction products was a result of the
substantially increased reaction time due to the insertion of a reaction
tube. Following a calibration of the exponential relationship between
reaction time and reaction tube length using the time difference between
the laser pulse and MS detection signals, we were able to determine
kinetic data for the model system IEDDA (click) reaction between a
tetrazine with a strained cycloalkyne. Additionally, this method has
shown excellent stability and improved sensitivity and proved to be
viable for several click reactions. With this reactive LAESI method,
a wide range of molecular reactions can potentially be studied, to
investigate rates, solvent effects on molecular reactions, or as a
tool to improve the detection of target analytes in ambient ionization
MS(I). Following these encouraging results, this reactive LAESI method
could also be extended to other reactions previously reported in reactive
DESI, like in the analyses of, e.g., saccharides with boronic acids,62 steroids with hydroxylamine,31 and/or protein–ligand interactions.82 Eventually, the present work is expected to enable in situ
reactions during bioanalytical MSI.
