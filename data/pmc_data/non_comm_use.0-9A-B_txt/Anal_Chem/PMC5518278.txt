The ability to characterize chemical
heterogeneity in biological
structures is essential to understanding cellular-level function in
both healthy and diseased states, but these variations remain difficult
to assess using a single analytical technique. While mass spectrometry
(MS) provides sufficient sensitivity to measure many analytes from
volume-limited samples, each type of mass spectrometric analysis uncovers
only a portion of the complete chemical profile of a single cell.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS and capillary
electrophoresis electrospray ionization (CE–ESI)-MS are complementary
analytical platforms frequently utilized for single-cell analysis.
Optically guided MALDI MS provides a high-throughput assessment of
lipid and peptide content for large populations of cells, but is typically
nonquantitative and fails to detect many low-mass metabolites because
of MALDI matrix interferences. CE–ESI-MS allows quantitative
measurements of cellular metabolites and increased analyte coverage,
but has lower throughput because the electrophoretic separation is
relatively slow. In this work, the figures of merit for each technique
are combined via an off-line method that interfaces the two MS systems
with a custom liquid microjunction surface sampling probe. The probe
is mounted on an xyz translational stage, providing
90.6 ± 0.6% analyte removal efficiency with a spatial targeting
accuracy of 42.8 ± 2.3 μm. The analyte extraction footprint
is an elliptical area with a major diameter of 422 ± 21 μm
and minor diameter of 335 ± 27 μm. To validate the approach,
single rat pancreatic islet cells were rapidly analyzed with optically
guided MALDI MS to classify each cell into established cell types
by their peptide content. After MALDI MS analysis, a majority of the
analyte remains for follow-up measurements to extend the overall chemical
coverage. Optically guided MALDI MS was used to identify individual
pancreatic islet α and β cells, which were then targeted
for liquid microjunction extraction. Extracts from single α
and β cells were analyzed with CE–ESI-MS to obtain qualitative
information on metabolites, including amino acids. Matching the molecular
masses and relative migration times of the extracted analytes and
related standards allowed identification of several amino acids. Interestingly,
dopamine was consistently detected in both cell types. The results
demonstrate the successful interface of optical microscopy-guided
MALDI MS and CE–ESI-MS for sequential chemical profiling of
individual, mammalian cells.

==== Body
Assessing
the cellular chemical
heterogeneity of biological tissues is an ongoing challenge in many
research fields.1−4 Frequently, the analysis
of bulk homogenates masks unique features of individual cells by averaging
the molecular content of cell populations.5 While a biological organ or tissue requires many distinct cells
to function properly, a malfunction can manifest from small cellular
subpopulations or even a single cell.6,7 Furthermore,
cells that are morphologically indistinguishable may possess unique
intracellular chemistries and, therefore, physiologies.

Mass
spectrometry (MS) is among the most commonly used analytical
methods for nontargeted single-cell analysis.4 Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS,8,9 electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS,1,10−13 and secondary ion MS (SIMS)14−17 are well-suited for multiplexed analysis of a wide
range of biological molecules.18 Measurements
are typically label-free and often consume only a fraction of surface-available
analytes. Page and Sweedler utilized radiography to demonstrate that,
even after the MALDI MS signal is fully depleted, about 30% of a protein
standard is removed.19 The recent progress
in single-cell MS can be attributed to advances in sensitivity, mass
resolution, and sample throughput of modern mass spectrometers, as
well as hyphenation of MS to other approaches. For example, optical
microscopy combined with single-cell MALDI MS allows rapid characterization
of dispersed cell populations.20 By locating
cells with optical microscopy, the analysis can proceed at an acquisition
rate of approximately 1 Hz.21 Using this
approach, differential peptide processing was detected in γ
cells derived from islets of Langerhans located in the dorsal and
ventral regions of the rat pancreas.22 This
finding supports the view that the chemical cellular heterogeneity
of different organs is neither well-understood nor well-characterized.
As another example, flow cytometry and transcriptomic analyses of
insulin-secreting β cells identified up to four β-cell
subtypes in humans with significantly different glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion.23 Motivated by these
examples, islet cells were chosen as a single-cell sample system in
an attempt to discover previously unknown heterogeneity or chemical
messengers.

MALDI MS is well-suited to detecting peptides and
lipids as their
high molecular masses minimize interference from the MALDI matrix;
however, many smaller metabolites are not detectable. A complementary
method for single-cell analysis is capillary electrophoresis (CE)–ESI-MS,
which is well suited for metabolomics measurements as it can quantitatively
identify metabolites from individual cells.11,24,25 Sample preparation for CE–ESI-MS
typically involves manual cell isolation, microfluidic cell sorting,
or collection of cell cytoplasm using a patch-clamp pipette.26,27 Metabolite detection using CE–ESI-MS generally requires injection
of the sample content from an entire cell.28 In contrast to MALDI MS, CE–ESI-MS has relatively low throughput
and is limited to a few cells per hour, a time constraint that precludes
the cell-by-cell analysis of even modestly sized populations.

Preliminary classification of the most informative individual cells
in a population via MALDI MS facilitates targeted CE–ESI-MS
analysis of rare and representative cells from among hundreds to thousands
of cells. Previous attempts to combine MALDI MS and CE–ESI-MS
utilized microfluidic29,30 and hydrodynamic31,32 interfaces. Although the same sample was analyzed with both instruments,
the methods had relatively low throughput due to the lack of automated
target collection, which therefore required excessive manual sample
handling. To reveal chemical heterogeneity in large populations of
cells, it is important that the interface method is capable of collecting
small sample volumes with high efficiency.

With that goal in
mind, we developed a semiautomated, microscopy-guided
liquid microjunction probe system for collection of analytes from
single cells that have been classified by their MALDI MS profiles.
The first coupling of CE and MALDI worked in the reverse of the system
described here in that the CE effluent was deposited onto a membrane
or MALDI target for analyte detection after the CE separation.30,33,34 In our approach, the MALDI measurement
is performed first, and then samples are collected from the target
for CE separation and analysis. The collection probe utilizes two
coaxial capillaries, similar to previous designs from our lab,32 and liquid microjunction surface sampling probes.35,36

Single-cell targeting is achieved with precise motion in three
axes of linear freedom controlled by a lab-built graphical user interface
that allows microscopy-guided cell targeting. The software, microMS,37 is an extension of software we originally developed
for microscopy-guided MALDI MS22 and SIMS,38 which directly controls the extraction probe.
While MALDI MS is not required for performing liquid extraction, it
can complement the microscopy information by providing label-free
classification of large populations. By interfacing two powerful analytical
tools for small-volume samples, the combined data obtained from CE–ESI-MS
and MALDI MS were used to successfully classify and analyze six α
and five β cells. Each cell was identified by MALDI MS as a
standard histological class by the detection of glucagon and insulin,
respectively. Small molecules detected with CE–ESI-MS include
18 proteinogenic amino acids as well as dopamine. While the enzymes
for dopamine synthesis suggest the presence of dopamine in β
cells,39,40 it appears that dopamine has not been directly
characterized at the single-cell level in either α or β
cells.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification.

Isolation of
Islets of Langerhans and Single-Cell Preparation
A 1.5 month
old, male Sprague–Dawley outbred rat (Rattus
norvegicus) was housed on a 12 h light cycle
and fed ad libitum. Animal euthanasia was performed in accordance
with the appropriate institutional animal care protocols (the Illinois
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee), and in full compliance
with federal guidelines for the humane care and treatment of animals.
Islets of Langerhans were manually isolated from an enzymatically
digested and mechanically treated pancreas, as previously reported.22 Briefly, the pancreas is injected through the
bile duct with 2 mL of 1.4 mg/mL collagenase P in modified Gey’s
balanced salt solution (mGBSS) supplemented with 5 mM glucose and
1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The mGBSS contained 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4.9 mM KCl, 0.2 mM KH2PO4, 11 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM MgSO4, 138 mM NaCl, 27.7 mM NaHCO3, 0.8 mM NaH2PO4, and 25 mM HEPES dissolved
in Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA), with the pH adjusted
to 7.2. The pancreas was then surgically dissected and placed into
8 mL of the collagenase P solution. Solutions were incubated in a
recirculating water bath for 20–30 min at 37 °C with agitation
to dissociate bulk tissue. Excess collagenase P was washed from the
resulting tissue with mGBSS containing glucose and BSA, and centrifuged
for 3 min at 300g. The resulting tissue pellet was
dispersed into mGBSS, and islets were manually isolated with a micropipette.
Single islets were incubated in 20 μL of 40% (v/v) glycerol
and 60% mGBSS with glucose, BSA, and 0.1 mg/mL Hoechst 33342. This
step resulted in staining of cell nuclei while mechanically stabilizing
cellular morphology.41 After 30 min, single
cells were dissociated onto clean indium–tin oxide (ITO)-coated
glass slides by gentle trituration in the staining solution and allowed
to adhere to the slides overnight. Prior to imaging, excess glycerol
was aspirated and the surface rinsed with 150 mM ammonium acetate
(pH 10).

Optically Guided Single-Cell Profiling
The next step
in the experimental workflow, as outlined in Scheme 1, is to locate cells by optical microscopy.
ITO-coated glass slides were prepared for optically guided single-cell
profiling by marking the perimeter of dissociated cells with ∼20
fiducial marks. Each mark consisted of an etched “x”
(see Figure 3A), which
remained visible during MALDI MS acquisition and liquid microjunction
extraction. The locations of fiducials and cells were determined by
whole-slide bright-field and fluorescence microscopy using an Axio
Imager M2 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired with a
10× objective and tiled to cover the entire region of interest.
Florescence imaging of Hoechst 33342 utilized an X-CITE 120 mercury
lamp (Lumen Dynamics, Mississauga, Canada) and a 31000v2 DAPI filter
set (Chroma Technology, Irvine, CA).

Scheme 1 Overview of the MALDI
MS Guided Liquid Microjunction Extraction Approach
Islets of Langerhans are isolated
from a rat pancreas and dissociated onto an ITO-coated glass slide.
MALDI MS is used to assay the hormone profile of individual cells
from a large population to identify extraction targets. The liquid
microjunction probe collects cell contents from specified locations
on the ITO-coated glass slide for follow-up CE–ESI-MS analysis.

Whole-slide images were utilized for optically
guided single-cell
profiling with microMS.37 Before MALDI
MS acquisition, the pixel locations of each fiducial were correlated
to their physical positions in the mass spectrometer. A point-based
similarity registration was then used to map cell locations on the
image to their corresponding physical locations.

After optical
imaging, samples were coated with MALDI matrix, using
an artist’s airbrush, containing 50 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxy-benzoic
acid (DHB) in 1:1 (v/v) ethanol/water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA), nebulized with 40 psi nitrogen. Coating thickness was assessed
optically during matrix application, with typical thicknesses of 0.2–0.4
mg/cm2. Samples were stored at room temperature (∼22
°C) in a nitrogen drybox until analyzed.

MALDI MS
Pancreatic
cell populations were rapidly profiled
with MALDI MS to stratify the population into traditional histological
classes. Specifically, the α and β cells were identified
based on the detection of glucagon (monoisotopic m/z 3481.6) or insulin-1 C peptide (m/z 3259.8). To prevent detection of the cellular
content of several cells simultaneously, as well as collection of
multicellular content during follow-up analyte extraction, cell coordinates
were first passed through a 300 μm distance filter. From a single
islet dispersed on an ITO-coated glass slide, approximately 200–400
pancreatic cells satisfied the sample analysis criteria.

Mass
spectra were acquired on a ultrafleXtreme MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer
with a frequency tripled Nd:YAG solid-state laser (Bruker Daltonics,
Billerica, MA). Each cell was profiled with 1000 shots using a 1 kHz
laser repetition rate with the “Ultra” laser setting
(spot diameter ∼100 μm). The resulting spectra were read
into MATLAB 8.6.0 with the readbrukermaldi function (https://github.com/AlexHenderson/readbrukermaldi). Data from molecular mass
windows containing signals from the peptide hormones of interest were
extracted and signal intensities were plotted, as shown in Figure 1. Cells were classified
based on their spectral profiles as α or β using signal
intensities at m/z 3483.9 and m/z 3259.8, respectively. For each mass
channel, a threshold value for signal intensity was manually determined
to identify cell types with high confidence. Because of the stringent
filter values, fewer than 100 cells were successfully classified by
this approach for each islet. Images of classified cells were then
examined to ensure the analyte extraction area contained no adjacent
cells.

dorsal pancreas islet is composed primarily of glucagon-containing
α cells (blue) and insulin-containing β cells (red). Classifications
are based on a threshold signal abundance to identify cell types for
follow-up CE–ESI-MS analysis. Cell identities correspond to
labeling of cell number for the α and β cells. (B) Spectra
of single pancreatic cells identified in panel A, parts i and ii.

Liquid Microjunction Extraction
Probe System
The liquid
microjunction extraction probe utilizes two coaxial capillaries. The
inner and outer fused-silica capillaries are 100 μm/170 μm
and 250 μm/350 μm in diameter, respectively (Polymicro
Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). The probe position was monitored in real
time with a digital video camera (Sony, Park Ridge, NJ; P/N DFW-X700).
Extraction liquid was delivered with a PHD 2000 syringe pump (Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and aspirated with 7–10 in Hg of
vacuum, supplied with a diaphragm vacuum/pressure pump (Cole-Parmer,
Vernon Hills, IL). The liquid microjunction was positioned with three
linear stages (Zaber Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) controlled
with the in-house written software, microMS.37 Samples collected by the probe were dried using a Mi-Vac sample
concentrator (SP Scientific, Warminster, PA) and stored at −20
°C prior to CE–ESI-MS analysis.

Radioactive Material and
Radiation Detection
Tritiated
(3H) angiotensin II, with the specific activity of 50 Ci/mmol
at 1 mCi/mL, was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St.
Louis, MO). Radioactivity experiments were performed in accordance
with the Illinois Radiation Protection Act under the University of
Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Type A Broad Scope Radioactive
Materials License issued by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.

Radioactive material deposition and extraction was visually monitored
using a Wild M3Z stereomicroscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). The
pre- and postextraction radioactivity of the deposited sample was
determined with a storage phosphor screen (BAS-IP TR 2025 E Tritium
Screen, Sigma-Aldrich) exposed to the sample for 6 h. Developing the
screen with a phosphorimager (Phosphorimager SI, Molecular Dynamics,
Sunnyvale, CA) allowed for relative quantitation of the sample/analyte
removal. Image processing was performed with custom MATLAB scripts.
The fraction of material removed was determined by the background-corrected,
normalized intensity at each pixel, before and after extraction.

CE–ESI-MS Analysis
Each cell extract was dried
and resuspended in 1 μL of 1% formic acid in liquid chromatography–MS
grade water. CE–ESI-MS was performed as reported previously
using a micrOTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics).27 Analyses were conducted in positive ion mode
using a 70.7 cm long CE fused-silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies),
a separation potential of 17 kV, and a sample injection volume of
∼15 nL. Extracted ion electropherograms were exported using
custom scripts in Bruker DataAnalysis version 4.4. Compounds were
identified from the electropherograms by matching the migration order
and mass-to-charge (m/z) values
with standards. In MATLAB, each extracted ion electropherogram was
baseline-subtracted and smoothed with a seven point moving average
filter. Analyte migration times were aligned to corresponding analyte
migration times in a reference mass electropherogram (α1), as
shown in Figure S1. The alignment used
a linear regression between migration times of a set of amino acids
found in each sample (i.e., glycine, alanine, threonine, leucine/isoleucine,
histidine, phenylalanine). To confirm the presence of dopamine, a
standard mix of 10 μM glycine, alanine, threonine, leucine,
histidine, and phenylalanine in 1% formic acid in water was analyzed
with a 68 cm long CE capillary at 10 kV with and without the addition
of 10 μM dopamine.

Results and Discussion
Liquid Microjunction Extraction
Probe System
As shown
in Figure S2 and partially in Figure 2, the liquid microjunction
extraction system consists of a lab-built, concentric capillary probe
coupled to a three-axis linear actuator positioning system. The single-cell
collection setup was designed to transfer cell metabolites from an
ITO-coated glass slide into a 200 μL microcentrifuge tube. The
basic operating principle is similar to a liquid microjunction surface
sampling probe except the solution is aspirated by vacuum pressure
instead of an electrospray. The diameters of the probe capillaries
were selected to be larger than the diameter of individual pancreatic
cells to ensure complete extraction, prevent clogging, and accommodate
the stage accuracy. The sizes of the inner and outer capillaries were
100 μm/170 μm and 250 μm/350 μm in diameter,
respectively; the diameter of pancreatic cells is ∼10–15
μm.42 Sample carryover may result
in cross-contamination of samples; therefore, ∼5 mm of the
polyimide coating was thermally removed at the ends of both capillaries.43 Following each sample collection, the probe
was immersed in extraction solution to thoroughly wash out its interior.

Figure 2 Partial
schematic of the liquid microjunction analyte extraction
system. Left: a system of three linear actuators positions the liquid
microjunction probe above a targeted cell. Right: analyte extraction
solution is pumped through the system to collect cellular content,
which is transferred to the custom vacuum chamber containing collection
vials.

The extraction solution consisted
of 1:1 methanol/water with 0.5%
acetic acid (v/v), which was previously shown to facilitate metabolite
extraction and detection with CE–ESI-MS.27 As shown in Figure S3, a small
meniscus forms at the probe tip during operation. Collections can
be performed sequentially without having to open the vacuum chamber.
The number of collections corresponds to the number of sample tubes
the system can accommodate (our system holds eight tubes). Extraction
liquid is delivered at 1.5 μL/min and aspirated with vacuum.

During system operation, the user moves the x,y-translation stage away from the sample area and lowers
the probe to the surface. The software records the z-axis position at the slide surface to enable automatic analyte extraction.
The probe position is monitored in real time with a digital video
camera. Next, coordinates from the whole-slide image and linear actuator
positions are correlated with a point-based similarity registration
utilizing more than 18 etched fiducial marks. Choosing a targeted
cell on the image activates the motion of the x,y-translation stage, moving it into position for analyte
extraction. The user initiates semiautomatic extractions by signaling
the microMS software with a key press. During extraction, the probe
is lowered to the slide for 60 s and then retracted. Alternatively,
analytes from a population of cells may be sequentially extracted
and pooled into a single collection vial. Following either collection
scheme, the probe is returned to the home position and submerged into
a reservoir of extraction solution for 90 s to rinse the probe exterior,
flush the inner capillary, and prevent carryover between samples.
As seen in Figure S6, blanks acquired from
locations adjacent to cells between extractions contained negligible
background signal.

The cell content collected at each coordinate
travels from the
MALDI sample plate (e.g., ITO glass slide), through the inner capillary
of the coaxial system, and into one of the microcentrifuge tubes contained
in the vacuum chamber. Inside the vacuum chamber, the microcentrifuge
tubes are covered with a thin strip of Parafilm M to prevent extraction
solution from clinging on the capillary when moving between collection
vials. The inner capillary is retracted from the current collection
tube, the tube carousel is indexed to the next position, and the inner
capillary is placed into the next collection tube without breaking
vacuum in the chamber. Individual samples were dried and stored at
−20 °C prior to CE–ESI-MS analysis.

Determination
of Target Localization Error
To ensure
that each analyte extraction is from the expected cell, it is imperative
to determine the target localization error. Analyte extraction locations
were visualized and characterized by the removal of MALDI matrix from
the sample plate. Image registration of fiducial markers allowed the
spatial correlation of requested target points and realized analyte
extraction positions (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Representative extractions
for determining target localization
error. Target points were positioned around fiducial marks placed
in the center of a glass slide. (A) Overlay of microscope image with
the position of target locations (green) and extraction areas (red).
(B) Box plot of the accuracies over four trials of fiducial registration.
The registration trial was the only confounding variable found to
significantly affect target localization error.

A glass slide was etched with 18 fiducial marks for point-based
registration, similar to typical cell extractions. An additional six
etched marks were placed within these fiducials to assist with image
registration, as they remain visible after MALDI matrix application
and extraction. Eight target locations were manually placed around
each of the six, interior etched marks in pairs to assess the effect
of repeated registrations. The slide was then coated with DHB and
placed into the liquid extraction stage as before. Two users each
performed two sets of extractions with 12 targets spread over the
six etched marks. This experimental design allowed evaluation of the
influence of the user, registration, and location on the target localization
error. Each target was extracted for 5 s, and the probe was washed
for 60 s after each set of 12 extractions.

Following extraction,
the sample was imaged again to locate target
etched marks and extraction locations. Extraction centers and diameters
were manually annotated. A custom MATLAB script was utilized to assess
the target localization error of each extraction. Regions surrounding
each etched mark were cropped from the whole-slide image. Several
locations on each mark were utilized to overlay the pre- and postextraction
images. Target locations on the pre-extraction image were then mapped
to the postextraction image with the same coordinate transformation.
The pixel distances between the target and actual positions were scaled
to micrometers. A three-way linear analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
utilized to assess the effect of each confounding variable. While
the operator and target spot location did not significantly influence
the target localization error (p = 0.15 and 0.06,
respectively), there was a significant effect from performing replicates
with the same sample and images (p = 0.004). This
highlights that the accurate determination of fiducial locations has
the largest influence on target localization error. The overall target
localization error was determined as 42.8 ± 2.3 μm (±SEM, n = 48; range 3.9–88.5 μm), which is well within
the average extraction radius of 206.3 ± 1.7 μm, as determined
by measurement of the size of the spot of removed DHB from the surface
(Figure S4). Therefore, it is assumed that
each extraction would contain only the target cell when a cell-to-cell
distance filter is set to be larger than 250 μm. This approach
ensures that the collection of single-cell samples is free from cross-contamination
by neighboring cells.

Characterization of Analyte Removal Efficiency
3H-angiotensin II was spotted onto an ITO-coated glass
slide
to determine the extraction profile and analyte removal efficiency.
Five spots of ∼1 μL of 1000 pCi of 3H-angiotensin
II in mGBSS supplemented with 5 mg/mL Fast green were deposited onto
the surface of an ITO-coated glass slide and allowed to dry for 24
h at room temperature (∼22 °C). Liquid microjunction extraction
of the radioactive material was performed as described above, with
minor adjustments to minimize the possibility of radioactive contamination
of the equipment. To replicate single-cell extraction conditions,
each 3H-angiotensin II spot was extracted for 60 s. The
removal efficiency was estimated by fitting the two-dimensional distribution
to a general Gaussian function, as described in Table S1.

Fitting results (Figures 4 and S5) provide
an estimated removal efficiency of 90.6 ± 0.6% (Table S1). While the extraction efficiency may be dependent
on the target analyte, the high removal efficiency found with angiotensin
suggests that the solvent composition and extraction time are suitable
for collecting small and intermediate-sized polar compounds, such
as the amino acids. The extraction footprint was found to be elliptical,
with a major diameter of 422 ± 21 μm and minor diameter
of 335 ± 27 μm. The estimated diameter from optical measurements
of DHB removal falls within the range of the minor and major diameters.
The eccentricity of the extraction footprint is likely due to imperfect
fabrication of the probe tip or stochastic wetting of the rough, matrix-covered
surface.

A phosphorimager was utilized to measure angiotensin distributions
pre- and postextraction, shown in panels A and B, respectively. (C)
Sample analysis of the left-most spot. Subregions surrounding each
extraction (i and ii) are utilized to determine the distribution of
the fraction of radioactivity removed (iii). The distribution is fit
to a general two-dimensional Gaussian (iv) to determine the fraction
removed. Residuals of the fit (v) are nonstructured, indicating the
model is appropriate. All scale bars are 500 μm.

Profiles of Small Molecules
CE–ESI-MS
complements
MALDI MS analyses by identifying small molecules from a single cell.
We present example extracted ion electropherograms with corresponding
MALDI mass spectra in Figure 5. All collected electropherograms are provided in Figure S6.

Figure 5 Single pancreatic islet cell analysis
using MALDI MS and CE–ESI-MS
interfaced with the off-line liquid microjunction extraction system.
(A) Representative single-cell MALDI MS profiles of single α
and β cells. (B) Corresponding CE–ESI-MS extracted ion
electropherograms of the same cells showing signals of amino acids
with high intensities and (C) signals of amino acids with lower signal
intensities.

Detected compounds include
the majority of the proteinogenic amino
acids, precursor molecules, and endocrine signaling molecules. In
contrast to characteristic peptide signatures, no obvious differences
were found between α and β cells in their metabolite profiles.
However, increasing the number of replicates and performing quantitative
measurements (e.g., including a labeled standard for metabolites of
interest) may allow identification of subtle heterogeneity between
each population. Improvements in CE–ESI-MS sensitivity would
facilitate detection of minor metabolites. An interesting observation
was the presence of dopamine in all α and β cells (Figure 6; a separation with
dopamine standard is shown in Figure S7). Previously, endogenous dopamine has been detected in single islets
via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay,40 but to our knowledge, not in single cells. β
cells are known to have the required enzymes for synthesis, metabolism,
and storage of dopamine, such as tyrosine hydroxylase44 and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2;45 thus, it is generally accepted that dopamine
is produced in β cells.39 Dopamine
within α cells is less studied, and whether dopamine is endogenous
to α cells has not yet been investigated. We report direct detection
of dopamine in single α and β cells, illustrating the
unique capabilities of the presented methodology and small-scale analyses.

Figure 6 Extracted
ion electropherograms for m/z 154.09
± 0.01. The peak with m/z and
migration time matching dopamine standard is shaded
in each electropherogram: (A) α cells; (B) β cells. Dopamine
was detectable in every cell analyzed. The peak at ∼16 min
is attributed to sodiated leucine. Single-cell samples analyzed with
technical replicates are annotated with decimals, e.g., α6.1.

Conclusions
We
developed a semiautomated method that couples high-throughput
single-cell chemical profiling with MALDI MS, followed by in-depth
analyses of representative cellular types with CE–ESI-MS metabolomics.
The approach leverages the low sample consumption of MALDI MS, which
enables the follow-up analysis of the same sample by CE–ESI-MS.
By hyphenating the two methods, we identified cell types by their
peptide profiles, and detected most amino acids and the signaling
molecule dopamine, a difficult task for either technique alone. While
pancreatic islet cell types were the focus of this study, the methodology
is suitable for a broad range of single-cell analyses of dissociated
tissues. Future work will leverage the unique capabilities to examine
heterogeneity within the nervous and endocrine systems.
