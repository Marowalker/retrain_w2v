Exosomes
are endosome-derived membrane vesicles carrying proteins
and nucleic acids that are involved in cellular functions such as
intercellular communication, protein and RNA secretion, and antigen
presentation. Therefore, exosomes serve as potential biomarkers for
many diseases including cancer. Because exosomes are difficult to
enrich or purify from biofluids, quantification of exosomes is tedious
and inaccurate. Here, we present a real-time, label-free, and quantitative
method to detect and characterize tumor-derived exosomes without enrichment
or purification. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi)
in combination with antibody microarrays specific to the extracellular
domains of exosome membrane proteins, exosomes in tumor cell culture
medium can be quantitatively detected. We found a positive correlation
between the metastatic potential of tumor cell lines and exosome secretion.
This method provides an easy, efficient, and novel way to detect exosome
secretion and thus an avenue toward the diagnosis and prognosis prediction
of cancer.

==== Body
Exosomes are small (30–100
nm in diameter) membrane vesicles secreted by various normal and tumor
cells.1 They are formed by inward budding
of endosome membranes to the intraluminal side, generating multivesicular
bodies (MVBs) with exosomes enclosed inside. The MVBs then fuse with
the plasma membrane and release the intraluminal exosomes to the extracellular
environment.2 As a result of this remodeling
process, exosomes carry membrane proteins (e.g., tetraspanin (CD9,
CD63, CD81) and heat shock protein (HSP70)), cytosol proteins, mRNA,
and miRNA, and participate in biological functions such as intercellular
communication, protein and RNA secretion, and antigen presentation.1a,3 Recently, exosomes have drawn a lot of attention as a source of
tumor antigens for dendritic cells (DCs) to induce antitumor immune
response.1b,4 However, accumulating evidence has shown
that tumor-derived exosomes can also suppress antitumor immune response
by impairing the function of lymphocytes5 or by inducing their apoptosis.6 Moreover,
exosomes are found to promote angiogenesis,7 to contribute to cancer progression and metastasis,8 and to serve as potential cancer biomarkers. Therefore,
there is an increasing need for developing effective and practical
method to detect and quantify tumor-derived exosomes for cancer diagnosis
and prognosis prediction.

Conventional methods to purify and
characterize exosomes in cell
culture supernatant (CCS) and body fluids are based on differential
ultracentrifugation alone9 or in combination
with ultrafiltration and density gradient separation,10 followed by electron microscopy,11 western blot,12 or enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA).10c These methods tend to
be time-consuming and inefficient.13 Newly
reported methods include the isolation of exosome by immunoaffinity
beads followed by flow cytometry14 or fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) anaysis.15 Yet, convenient,
direct, and quantitative measurement techniques are still largely
needed.13b,16 As demonstrated by the immunoaffinity bead
method, exosomes can be captured by antibodies specific to their transmembrane
proteins, but this method does not take advantage of the fact that
exosomes are much larger than soluble proteins or protein complexes
and can therefore be distinguished from them in body fluids. In this
respect, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) is one such convenient
biosensing technology that is mass-sensitive.

Surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) is a label-free, real-time sensor
technique to detect molecular interactions occurring in proximity
to a precious metal (gold/silver) surface based on monitoring changes
in refractive index resulting from molecular binding, which causes
a thickness increase of the adsorbed layer.17 In SPRi, a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is used for reflection
detection and surface imaging. At a fixed angle of incidence, the
detected reflection changes can be transformed into the refractive
index changes resulting from molecular binding. In this way, both
sensorgrams (i.e., resonance signal vs time) and images of the sensor
chip can be recorded, allowing high-throughput analysis of up to 1000
interactions (Figure 1).18 Typical SPR instruments are sensitive to binding events
occurring within 200 nm of the surface.19 Therefore, particles of around 100 nm, such as exosomes, are perfectly
suited to SPRi detection. When we were preparing this paper, Im et
al.20 reported an exosome assay utilizing
transmission SPR through periodic nanohole arrays functionalized with
antibodies specific to exosome surface proteins. Utilizing this method,
they identified exosomes purified from ovarian cancer cell culture
and exosomes in ascites from ovarian cancer patients.

Figure 1 Schematic view of SPRi
in combination with antibody microarray
to capture and detect exosomes in cell culture supernatant. Antibodies
specific to exosome transmembrane proteins were printed on the gilded
gold chip. The optical path from the laser passes through the coupling
prism at a fixed angle of incidence, and the reflection is recorded
by a CCD camera. Upon injection of sample into the flow cell, exosomes
can be captured by antibodies on the chip, resulting in changes in
the refractive index and therefore changes in the reflection intensities,
which is monitored by the CCD camera.

Here, we used conventional SPRi in combination with antibody
microarrays
to detect and quantify exosomes in CCS. Antibodies specific to exosome
transmembrane proteins including tetraspanins (e.g., CD9),1 glycoprotein CD41b,21 and tyrosine kinase receptor MET8a were
printed and immobilized on the gold-coated glass sensor chip (Figure 1). Using this sensor chip, we detected exosomes
in CCS from human hepatoma cell lines MHCC97H/L and mouse melanoma cell
lines B16-F1/10 without purification, and we monitored changes in
the exosome abundance in CCS. We also observed a positive correlation
between the metastatic potential of the cell lines and the exosome
level. This method provides an efficient way for exosome detection
and monitoring, and may be valuable for application in biological
and clinical studies.

Experimental Section
Antibodies
Antibodies
used in this study are as follows.
Anti-extracellular part: mouse anti-human CD9 (MAB1880, R&D),
rabbit anti-human CD63 (MAB5048, R&D), mouse anti-human CD41b
(555468, BD), mouse anti-human CD81 (MAB4165, R&D), mouse anti-human
CD82 (MAB4616, R&D), mouse anti-human E-cadherin (AB8993, Abcam),
and mouse anti-human EpCAM (MAB9601, R&D). Anti-intracellular
part: rabbit anti-human CD9 N-term (AP1482a, Abgent), rabbit anti-human
CD81 C-term (AP6631b, Abgent), anti-CD82 C-term (AB66400, Abcam),
and mouse anti-human E-cadherin C-term (AB76055, Abcam). Anti-mouse
IgG (557273, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-human MET (5631, Cell Signaling),
and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) were
also used.

Cell Culture
Human hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines
(MHCC97L, MHCC97H) and mouse melanoma cell lines (B16-F1, B16-F10)
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco,
Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Hyclone, Gibco), 50 units penicillin/50 mg streptomycin, 20
mM HEPES, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mM
nonessential amino acids (Gibco) at 37 °C (5% CO2).
The cells were split every 2 to 3 days under sterile conditions.

Exosome Isolation and CCS Filtering
Cells (1 ×
108 cells) were washed twice with 30 mL DMEM and cultured
in vesicle-depleted medium (100 mL DMEM with or without depleted FBS)
for 48 h. Exosomes were isolated from CCS using the standard ultracentrifugation
protocol9b,22 with modification. Briefly, cell culture
medium (DMEM without FBS) was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min followed by 2000g for 10 min and then
12 000g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove
intact cells, cell debris, and large microvesicles. The supernatant
was collected as CCS. CCS was then centrifuged at 100 000g for 120 min to sediment exosomes. The sediment exosomes
were resuspended in PBS. In each exosome preparation, the concentration
of total protein was quantified by BCA assay (Pierce Chemical, Rockford,
IL, USA). CCS filtrate was obtained by passing the CCS (cultured in
10% depleted FBS in DMEM instead of serum-free DMEM) through a 300
kDa filter (Millipore, MA, USA).

Western Blot
Cells
and exosomes were resuspended in
ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 250 mM NaCl,
3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM PNPP,
and 10 μg/mL aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell and exosome
lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE before being transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Pall Corporation, Pensacola, FL). Nitrocellulose membranes
were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl,
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min at room temperature.
Primary antibodies were diluted (1:500) in TBST buffer containing
5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and then applied to the membranes overnight
at 4 °C. After washing with TBST three times, the membranes were
incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min
at room temperature and then washed again. Immunoreactive bands were
visualized by Super Signal chemiluminescence (Pierce Chemical, Rockford,
IL).

Antibody Microarray Fabrication and Surface Plasmon Resonance
Imaging (SPRi) Measurement
Antibodies were diluted to a final
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with PBS and printed onto the bare gold-coated
(thickness 47 nm) PlexArray Nanocapture Sensor Chip (Plexera Bioscience,
Seattle, WA, USA) at 40% humidity using SmartArrayer 48 microarray
printer (CapitalBio, China). Each antibody was printed in replicate
on the chip, and each spot contained 0.1 μL of antibody solution.
The chip was incubated in 80% humidity at 4 °C overnight before
being rinsed with 1× PBS for 30 min, 0.1× PBS for 10 min,
and deionized water for 10 min. Following that, the chip was blocked
with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in PBS overnight and washed with 1×
PBS for 30 min, 0.1× PBS for 10 min, and deionized water for
10 min before being dried under a stream of nitrogen prior to use.

SPRi measurements were performed with PlexAray HT (Plexera Bioscience,
Seattle, WA, USA). Collimated light (660 nm) passes through the coupling
prism, reflects off the SPR-active gold surface, and is received by
the CCD camera. Buffers and samples were injected by a nonpulsatile
piston pump into the 30 μL flow cell, which was mounted on the
coupling prim. For each measurement cycle, PBS running buffer was
first flowed through the surface at a constant rate of 2 μL/s
to obtain a stable baseline, and then the sample was injected at 5
μL/s for binding; after binding, the surface was washed with
PBS at 2 μL/s for 300 s and regenerated with 0.5% (v/v) H3PO4 at 2 μL/s for 300 s. All measurements
were performed at 4 °C. The signal changes after binding and
washing (in RIU) are recorded as the assay value.

Selected antibody-grafted
regions in the SPR images were analyzed,
and the average reflectivity variations of the chosen areas were plotted
as a function of time. Real-time binding signals were recorded and
analyzed by Data Analysis Module (DAM, Plexera Bioscience, Seattle,
WA, USA).

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
Twenty microliters
(5 μg) of exosomes in PBS was placed onto carbon-coated EM grids
and fixed for 20 min with 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany)
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Exosomes were stained by 2% uranyl acetate
for 5 min. Samples were observed under a Philips CM120 electron microscope
(FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a digital
camera Keen View (SIS, Germany).

Results and Discussion
Identification
of Purified Exosomes
We first determined
whether the antibody microarray SPRi sensor chip could identify purified
exosomes. Exosomes were purified from the CCS of human hepatoma cell
line MHCC97H by ultracentrifugation. Morphologies of the purified
exosomes were characterized by TEM, showing a mean diameter of ∼70
nm (Figure 2a), consistent with the size of
reported exosomes.23 SPRi measurements
were performed as illustrated in Figure 1.
Antibodies specific to the widely reported exosome transmembrane proteins
CD9, CD63, and CD82,1 the tumor-related
transmembrane proteins CD41b,21 EpCAM,16a and E-cadherin,7b as well as the negative control anti-mouse IgG were printed on the
sensor chip. Each antibody was printed at the same concentration of
0.5 mg/mL. The purified exosomes were injected into the flow cell
at a concentration of 5 μg/mL and at a rate of 5 μL/s.
Sensorgrams showed that all of the antibodies have much higher binding
signals compared to that of the negative control anti-mouse IgG (red
curve) (Figure 2b), indicating their binding
with exosomes. Typically, the binding signals at the spots with anti-CD9
(cyan curve) and CD41b (purple curve) were extremely high, indicating
that these two antibodies have a strong binding ability for exosomes
from MHCC97H. This is reasonable considering that different classes
of exosomes might exihibit distinct membrane protein profiles. Indeed,
exosomes isolated by anti-A33- or anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic beads
have been shown to have different compositions of membrane proteins,
intracellular proteins, and nucleic acids.16a,24 The binding signal of anti-mouse IgG was slightly higher than the
baseline due to nonspecific binding. The expression of CD9 and CD41b
in the purified exosomes was verified by western blot, using MHCC97H
cell lysates as a positive control (Figure 2c). These results suggested that the antibody microarray SPRi sensor
chip was able to capture purified exosomes and to characterize their
transmembrane protein profile.

of time (s). Anti-mouse IgG was used as a negative control. (c) Western
blot detection of the expression of CD9 and CD41b in exosomes. MHCC97H
cell lysates were used as a positive control.

Identification of Exosomes in CCS without Purification
We
then checked whether the antibody microarray SPRi sensor chip
could identify exosomes in CCS directly without enrichment or purification.
Exosomes contain various transmembrane proteins and cytosol contents;
hence, they have much higher molecular weights compared to that of
the free proteins in CCS and can therefore be removed from CCS by
passing through a 300 kDa filter. We checked the existence of exosomes
in unfiltered CCS and CCS filtrate by western blot, which revealed
the expression of two exosome marker transmembrane proteins, CD9 and
CD41b,25 in CCS using cell lysate as a
positive control, whereas no bands were observed in CCS filtrate.
These results indicated the existence of exosomes in CCS and the absence
of exosomes in CCS filtrate (Figure 3a). We
then compared SPRi binding signals of exosome-containing CCS, exosome-excluded
CCS filtrate, and cell culture medium to anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b,
which were demonstrated to have strong affinity to purified exosomes
(Figure 2b,c). Anti-mouse IgG was used as a
negative control. As expected, both anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b demonstrated
significant signals for binding using CCS compared to that from CCS
filtrate, and nearly no binding signal was observed using cell culture
medium, indicating that exosomes in CCS were captured by these two
antibodies (Figure 3b). There was still a noticeable
binding signal generated from the filtered CCS with the anti-CD41b
antibody (Figure 3b), suggesting that, besides
exosomes, free CD41b protein might also be present in CCS. Another
explanation is that there was nonspecific binding of filtered CCS
to anti-CD41b antibody. The latter might be more plausible considering
the western blot results that showed that anti-CD41b did not detect
any band in CCS filtrate (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 Direct identification
of exosomes in CCS. (a) Detection of CD9
and CD41b in CCS and CCS filtrate by western blot. Cell lysates were
used as a positive control. The proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) from CCS/CCS filtrate. (b) SPRi response signals of anti-CD9/CD41b
and anti-mouse IgG to cell culture medium (DMEM), CCS, and CCS filtrate.
The results are representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).
(c) Schematic representation of the biogenesis of exosomes. Exosomes
originate from the inward budding of endosome membranes, generating
multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with exosomes inside. The MVBs then fuse
with the plasma membrane and release the intraluminal exosomes to
the extracellular environment. (d) SPRi response signals of exosomes
in CCS to antibodies specific to extracellular or intracellular domains
of the transmembrane proteins CD9, CD81, CD82, and E-cadherin. Exosomes
bound only to antibodies recognizing the extracellular domains, not
to the ones recognizing the intracellular domains. The results are
representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).

It has been generally accepted that exosomes are
formed by the
inward budding of endosome membranes and are secreted through fusion
with the cell membrane. As a result of this membrane remodeling, exosomes
have the same membrane orientation as that of the parent cell. In
other words, the extracellular domains of the parent cell transmembrane
proteins are still exposed to the outside of the exosomes (Figure 3c).1a,3b,25a Using the antibody microarray SPRi sensor chip, we compared the
binding of exosomes in CCS to the antibodies recognizing the intracellular
or extracellular domains of the transmembrane proteins CD9, CD81,
CD82, and E-cadherin. As expected, exosomes bound only to antibodies
recognizing the extracellular domains, not to the ones recognizing
the intracellular domains (Figure 3d), indicating
that the extracellular domains face the outside of the exosome, which
means that the exosomes have the same membrane orientation as that
of the parent cell, supporting the inward budding biogenesis pathway
of exosomes (Figure 3c). These results also
supported the notion that the binding signal on SPRi originated from
exosome membrane proteins, not from the free protein or membrane debris
in CCS.

Monitoring the Regulation of Exosome Secretion
We further
determined whether the SPRi antibody microarray was a sensitive method
to monitor the changes of exosome levels in CCS by modulating exosome
secretion in MHCC97H cells using siRNA-Rab27a and monensin. Rab27a
is an important gene in the exosome secretion pathway whose inhibition
has been reported to decrease the secretion of exosomes in both HeLa
cervical cancer cells and MAD-MB-231 breast cancer cells, as determined
by binding to antibody-coated beads followed by flow cytometry, and
by nanoparticle tracking analysis.15c,26 Here, we used
siRNA to knockdown the expression of Rab27a in order to suppress exosome
secretion. As expected, the binding signal of anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b
to CCS from cells transfected with siRNA-Rab27a was significantly
lower than that from cells transfected with negative control siRNA
(siRNA-NC) (Figure 4a), indicating decreased
exosome secretion with siRNA-Rab27a. Monensin is a Na+,
K+-exchanger that was reported to increase exosome secretion
in K562 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line.27 Here, we showed that after monensin treatment the binding
signals of anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b to CCS was significantly higher
than that from the ones treated with the solvent control, indicating
elevated exosome secretion after monensin treatment. This was further
confirmed by western blot, which showed significant bands of both
CD9 and CD41b in purified exosomes from MHCC97H cells with monensin
treatment compared to that from the ones without treatment (Figure 4c). These results demonstrate the validity of the
antibody microarray SPRi sensor chip to monitor exosome level changes
in CCS.

Figure 4 Regulation of exosome secresion. (a) Exosome secresion was suppressed
by siRNA-Rab27a. SPRi response signals from anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b
decreased with siRNA-Rab27a, using siRNA-NC as a negative control.
Lipofectamine 2000 was used for the transfection. (b) Exosome secresion
was increased by monensin treatment. The cells were treated with monensin
at a concentration of 1 μM and incubated for 48 h before being
detected by SPRi. Methanol, which was used to dilute monensin, was
used as a negative control. SPRi response signals from anti-CD9 and
anti-CD41b increased with monensin treatment. The results are representative
of three independent experiments. *p < 0.01 (Student’s t test). (c) Detection of CD9 and CD41b in purified exosomes
from MHCC97H cells with (+) or without (−) monensin treatment
by western blot.

SPRi sensitivity is dependent
on target analyte mass, immobilized
ligand density, and analyte–ligand affinity.28 The lipid mass of exosomes provides binding signals that
are sensitive enough for SPRi to detect and possibly quantify exosomes.
This was proven by Jung et al.,29 who quantified
biotin-functionalized vesicles bound to a streptavidin-coated chip
from the SPR signal based on the mass of lipids in the vesicles using
a method described elsewhere18,30 and showed that the
SPR signal was proportional to the number of bound vesicles per unit
area. Here, we used the same method according to eqs 10 and 11 in
ref (30b) to quantify
exosomes captured by antibody microarray chip. Basically, the measured
SPRi signals were converted to effective adlayer thickness using the
known refractive index of the solvent and the adsorbate and the calibration
of SRPi signals verus bulk refractive index changes. The estimated
effective adlayer thickness was then converted to surface coverage
(number of molecules per unit area) using the molar volume of the
adsorbate in the same buffer. Unlike the vesicles in Jung et al.29 that contained only one type of lipid, exosomes
are composed of various lipids, among which phospholipids such as
phosphatidyl choline (PC) were the most abundant.31 Therefore, we estimated the surface coverage of exosomes
assuming that they were composed of DOPC whose refractive index was
estimated to be 1.49,32 and the volume
was 0.92 mL/g lipids.33 The SPRi signal
of ∼28 μRIU (Figure 4a) corresponded
to ∼1.83 × 1012 lipids/cm2, or ∼4.87
× 107 exosomes/cm2 based on the diameter
(∼70 nm) of exosomes.

The Highly Metastatic Cell Line Secreted
More Exosomes than
the Poorly Metastatic One
Tumor metastasis is a leading cause
of cancer death. However, the mechanism of tumor metastasis is largely
unknown. It has been reported that exosomes participate in the process
of tumor metastasis.4c,34 To test if exosome levels related
to metastasis can be observed by the antibody microarray SRPi sensor
chip, we compared two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with
different metastatic potentials, MHCC97H and MHCC97L. The former is
highly metastatic compared to the latter.35 We found that both anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b had much higher SPRi
binding signals to CCS from MHCC97H compared to that from MHCC97L,
indicating that MHCC97H secreted more exosomes into CCS than MHCC97L.
We then isolated exosomes from the same number of MHCC97H and MHCC97L
cells and used western blot to quantify CD9 and CD41b. As expected,
both proteins had higher expression levels in the isolated exosomes
from MHCC97H than in those from MHCC97L (Figure 5b,c), in accordance with the SPRi results. Additionally, two melanoma
cell lines, B16-F1 and B16-F10, were analyzed by SPRi using an anti-CD9/CD41b/MET
array. B16-F10 has been reported to be highly metastatic compared
to B16-F1. Moreover, exosomes secreted from B16-F10 have much higher
levels of tyrosine kinase reporter MET than those from B16-F1.8a As expected, both anti-CD9 and anti-CD41b had
higher binding signals to CCS from B16-F10 compared to that from B16-F1
(Figure 5d), which is in agreement with previous
reports8a as well as with the trend observed
with MHCC97H and MHCC97L whereby highly metastatic cells secreted
more exosomes than the poorly metastatic ones. The binding signal
of anti-MET to CCS from B16-F10 was also much higher than the that
from B16-F1 (Figure 5d), confirming a higher
level of MET in exosomes from B16-F10. These results not only reveal
a positive correlation between exosome secretion and metastatic potential
but also prove the capability of this method to test cancer metastasis,
proposing the possible application of this method for clinical use.

in lysis buffer and analyzed by western blot. (c) Quantification of

accordingly. (d) SPRi response signals of anti-CD9/CD41b/MET were
higher in CCS from B16-F10 than in that from B16-F1. All histograms

Conclusions
In this study, we showed
a real-time, label-free, and quantitative
method to detect exosomes in CCS using SPRi in combination with antibody
microarrays specific to exosome transmembrane proteins. Using this
method, changes in exosome levels in CCS can be monitored. A positive
association between exosome secretion and metastatic potential was
also observed. This method provides an avenue toward monitoring the
progression and predicting the prognosis of cancer.
