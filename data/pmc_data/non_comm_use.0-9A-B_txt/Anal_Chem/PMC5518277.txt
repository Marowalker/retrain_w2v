A hand-held diode
laser is implemented for solid sampling in portable
ambient mass spectrometry (MS). Specifically, a pseudocontinuous wave
battery-powered surgical laser diode is employed for portable laser
diode thermal desorption (LDTD) at 940 nm and compared with nanosecond
pulsed laser ablation at 2940 nm. Postionization is achieved in both
cases using atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). The laser
ablation atmospheric pressure photoionization (LAAPPI) and LDTD-APPI
mass spectra of sage leaves (Salvia officinalis) using a field-deployable quadrupole ion trap MS display many similar
ion peaks, as do the mass spectra of membrane grown biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results indicate that
LDTD-APPI method should be useful for in-field sampling of plant and
microbial communities, for example, by portable ambient MS. The feasibility
of many portable MS applications is facilitated by the availability
of relatively low cost, portable, battery-powered diode lasers. LDTD
could also be coupled with plasma- or electrospray-based ionization
for the analysis of a variety of solid samples.

==== Body
There has been a rapid increase
in the development of portable mass spectrometers (MS) and their application
to the analysis of gaseous, liquid, and solid samples.1 Potential applications of portable MS include in-field
sampling of native plant2,3 or microbial communities.4−6 For example, portable MS could be used for quality control in herbal
supplements7 or to identify microbial colonies
on medical devices for the purpose of disease prevention.8

Along with other classes of ion sources
used for MS,9 ambient or atmospheric pressure
sources have
been investigated for use in portable MS due to the convenience imparted
by direct sampling without the extraction, pyrolysis, and/or desiccation
required by traditional MS sample preparation methods.10 Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)11−13 and plasma discharge-based ion sources14−16 are both well-established
for direct sampling of solids in portable ambient MS. However, such
ion sources can suffer from fluctuations in the efficiency with which
analytes are extracted/volatilized then ionized. For example, the
efficiency with which plasma-based sources will detect analytes in
a solid sample will depend on the specific plasma conditions and source-to-sample
distance as well as sample volatility and thermal stability.14−16

Laser sampling induces desorption/ablation of analyte from
the
surface of a solid sample and can additionally permit MS imaging at
relatively high lateral resolution.9 Laser
desorption/ablation is also well established for sampling at atmospheric
pressure, especially using ultraviolet or infrared lasers with pulse
lengths ranging from ∼10 ns to <100 fs.9,17−20 However, such lasers are usually too expensive, delicate, and complicated
for routine application in portable ambient MS, especially when compared
with DESI, paper spray, or other plasma-based methods. A potential
portable solution can be found in laser diode thermal desorption (LDTD),21 which uses continuous wave (CW) or pseudo-CW
near-IR diode lasers to volatilize solid samples.

This technical
note demonstrates the implementation of a hand-held
diode laser for solid sampling in portable ambient MS. A battery-powered
surgical laser diode is employed for portable LDTD at 940 nm and compared
with laser ablation by a laboratory-based nanosecond pulsed laser
operating at 2940 nm. Postionization is achieved using atmospheric
pressure photoionization (APPI).18 Experiments
that used the 940 nm, portable laser diode are referred to as LDTD-APPI,
while those that used the pulsed 2940 nm laboratory laser are referred
to as LAAPPI, for consistency with published nomenclature.18,21 These experiments compare the analysis of intact plant leaves and
bacterial biofilms by LDTD-APPI with the established method of LAAPPI,18,21 thereby demonstrating the feasibility of LDTD-APPI for in-field
sampling of native plant or microbial communities. A preliminary version
of the LDTD-APPI source was previously reported.22

Experimental Details
Ion Source and Ambient MS
The home-built
LDTD-APPI
source shown in Figure 1 is based on an APPI source23 that consists
of a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization lamp and dopant gas
nebulizer, to which a laser has been added for desorption/ablation.
A radio frequency-powered krypton gas discharge VUV lamp (KrLM-LQD12,
Resonance Ltd., Barrie, Ont., Canada) that outputs at 10.0/10.6 eV
is used for photoionization. Dopant vapor is used in most of the experiments
presented here as it has been previously shown to improve ionization
efficiency in APPI through charge transfer and proton exchange.24,25 The nebulizer for dopant delivery was inspired by a published design23 and consists of a stainless steel tee-junction
(VICI Valco, Houston, TX) that is fitted to a stainless steel heater
block adapter machined in-house to incorporate a heater cartridge
(Watlow FIREROD, Ash Equipment Co., Batavia, IL). The tee-junction
has two inputs for dopant delivery from a syringe pump and nitrogen
gas delivery, and an output to an effluent capillary tip that delivers
the heated dopant vapor close to the intersection of the laser desorption/ablation
spot on the sample, the VUV ionization region, and the atmospheric
pressure aperture of the MS.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the laser diode thermal
desorption atmospheric
pressure photoionization (LDTD-APPI) source with a battery-powered,
portable, pseudo-CW 940 nm diode laser.

This LDTD-APPI source uses a CW diode laser operating at
940 nm
for sample desorption (iLase, Biolase Tech, Irvine, CA). This hand-held
laser (100 g, 21 cm long) is designed for dental surgical applications,
is equipped with 1 h lifetime rechargeable batteries, has a 3 W peak
power optical output, and is typically operated in a pseudo-CW mode
(0.1 ms on/0.2 ms off). The laser beam is guided to the ablation area
via a disposable, 400 μm fiber optic tip that can be bent to
accommodate spatially constricted samples. A diode laser output of
∼700 mW output (power density ∼ 140 W/cm2) was generally used to collect the LDTD-APPI mass spectra.

The LAAPPI source follows a previously reported configuration,18 but with the same VUV lamp and dopant vapor
delivery scheme, as shown in Figure 1 and described above. LAAPPI employs a ∼7 ns,
20 Hz pulsed, laboratory laser operating at 2940 nm composed of an
optical parametric oscillator pumped by a Nd:YAG laser (Opolette 2940,
Opotek, Carlsbad, CA). The laser output is focused via a biconvex
CaF2 lens into a 450 μm core GeO2 fiber
patch (Infrared Fiber Systems, Silver Springs, MD) and the fiber output
beam is collimated and focused through two plano-convex CaF2 lenses directly onto the sample. The output from the fiber optic
in LAAPPI was generally ∼2 mJ/pulse (power density ∼
25 W/cm2).

The mass spectrometric analyses were performed
using a field-deployable
3D ion trap (MT Explorer 50, MassTech, Columbia, MD).26 The inlet cone was set to 120 °C and the capillary
voltage at 10 VDC, with automatic gain control enabled with target
value set at 100,000. A high transmission wire grid was also mounted
on the output end of the VUV lamp (not shown in Figure 1) and connected to both the sample plate
and the capillary (including the aperture cone to the mass spectrometer)
so that all three sat at the same voltage during analysis. The resultant
electric field-free region in the vicinity of the MS aperture was
an attempt to minimize signal losses due to possible ion deflection
away from the aperture caused by sample charging effects and/or an
electric field gradient. Minimum and maximum injection times for individual
mass scans were 1 and 1000 ms, respectively, for the sage analysis.
Biofilm analyses used a fixed injection time of 100 ms. Spectra were
averaged over one min of individual scans for sage and two min for
biofilms.

Chemicals, Samples, and Replicates
Anisole (99.7%)
and toluene (≥99.9%) were used as purchased (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). 4-Amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (C8H8ClNO3, 97%) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
was dissolved in spectroscopic grade methanol to a concentration of
10 mg/mL then deposited onto chitosan-alginate polyelectrolyte multilayers
adsorbed onto gold coated silicon wafers, prepared as described previously.27 LDTD-APPI and LAAPPI analyses of the resultant
standard samples were replicated at least four times while rastering
the sample with respect to the laser spot at a rate of 0.2 mm/s.

Organic sage leaves (Salvia officinalis) were purchased from a local supermarket and stored at ∼4
°C prior to analysis. The leaves were washed with deionized,
distilled water to remove dirt, blotted dry, and then mounted onto
a glass slide using double-sided copper tape with the abaxial side
facing up. LDTD-APPI and LAAPPI analyses were replicated on at least
five replicates rastering at 0.3 mm/s with 5 μL/min anisole
dopant and ∼80 mL/min nitrogen flow rates.

A total of
10 μL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate overnight culture at 0.1 OD600 were
inoculated onto a polycarbonate membrane placed on top of nutrient-defined Clostridium Staphylococcus Pseudomonas agar plate
and grown for 3 days. The resultant biofilms were exposed to 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h for sterilization, transferred onto a
stainless steel plate, and frozen to remove the membrane prior to
analysis. LDTD-APPI and LAAPPI analyses were performed on at least
seven distinct biofilm samples, rastering at 0.03 mm/s with 0.2 μL/min
toluene dopant flow rate, and ∼50 mL/min nitrogen flow rate.

Results and Discussion
LAAPPI (2940 nm, ∼7 ns pulsed)
and LDTD-APPI (940 nm, pseudo-CW)
mass spectra of the 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (MACA,
201.02 Da) standard both show intense MH+ ions in Figure 2, although LDTD-APPI
displayed more fragmentation. The dopant vapor was not required in
either case and was therefore not used. Both LAAPPI and LDTD-APPI
displayed the 3:1 peak intensity ratio at m/z 201.6 and 203.6 attributed to the MH+ ion that
is characteristic of the 35Cl/37Cl isotopic
ratio expected for MACA. Tandem MS experiments detected ions resulting
from losses of ClCOOH and ClCH2COOH from MH+, confirming this assignment (data not shown). Direct laser desorption
ionization (without VUV lamp) of MACA was also observed for the 2940
nm laser, but not for 940 nm LDTD. The VUV lamp generated a signal
via postionization for LDTD-APPI and enhanced the signal with LAAPPI
(see Figure 2). Also
observed in the LDTD-APPI mass spectra of Figure 2 were peaks at m/z 215.4, [M + 14]+ and m/z 189.3, [M – 12]+. The characteristic
chlorine isotopic distributions of these two peaks indicate they derive
from ion molecule reactions followed by fragmentation and/or rearrangement
of precursor ions.

Figure 2 Mass spectra of the MACA standard (inset shows chemical
structure)
analyzed by (from top to bottom) 2940 nm laser ablation atmospheric
pressure photoionization (LAAPPI), LDTD-APPI, 2940 nm laser ablation
(without VUV lamp), and 940 nm LDTD (without VUV).

LAAPPI was previously used to analyze phytochemicals
of sage leaves,28 so this analysis was
repeated here as a sort
of “real life” standard and compared in Figure 3 with an analysis of sage leaves
by LDTD-APPI. Both anisole and toluene were used as dopants given
that their low ionization energies (8.20 and 8.83 eV, respectively)
are well below the photon energy of the VUV source (10.0/10.6 eV).
However, Figure 3 displays
only the results with anisole due to its lower background.

The LAAPPI and LDTD-APPI mass
spectra of sage leaves shown in Figure 3 appear rather similar
to a cursor visual examination. Table 1 outlines the 12 common peaks that were observed from
sage leaves by both methods, as well as the three additional peaks
observed exclusively by only one of the two methods, obtained by averaging
all five replicates. The letters “(a)” to “(e)”
annotate peaks observed by both LAAPPI and LDTD-APPI (see Table 1) for whom tentative
assignments were additionally made based on phytochemicals previously
reported from sage leaves or extracts thereof (see Supporting Information).28,29

a Peaks were included only if they
were observed in ≥50% of the samples with >5 signal-to-noise
(S/N) when compared against the anisole background. The letters “(a)”
to “(e)” annotate the same peaks so noted in Figure 3, while italicized
peaks in LDTD-APPI are those that also appeared with toluene dopant.

b Denotes low S/N peak.

c LDTD-APPI peaks that appear with
both anisole and toluene dopant are italicized.

However, it is important to note
that all the peak assignments
are only tentative and are based on prior GC-MS, LC-MS, and LAAPPI
studies.28,29 The ±0.5 Da mass error of the field
deployable ion trap used here limits the peak assignment accuracy.
Furthermore, attempts to collect tandem MS data directly from the
sage leaves were unsuccessful, presumably due to the low sensitivity
of the ion trap mass analyzer. Peaks that were not observed here,
but were observed previously28 by LAAPPI
include m/z 169.1, 286.2, 300.2,
315.1, 316.2, 331.2, 332.2, and 346.2. Differences in the peaks observed
here and previously by LAAPPI28 might be
attributed to the use of different mass analyzers, MS source conditions,
and sage leaf growth conditions, storage conditions, and/or genetics.

The LAAPPI and LDTD-APPI mass spectra shown in Figure 4 of membrane-grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms are also quite similar
by visual inspection. Table 2 lists 21 peaks observed by both methods and an additional
two peaks observed exclusively by only one method, obtained by averaging
all seven replicates. Of these 21 common peaks, those annotated with
the lower case letters “(a)” to “(g)”
in Figure 4 and Table 2 were those that
could additionally be tentatively assigned to metabolites previously
reported for P. aeruginosa cultures
by various MS strategies (see Supporting Information).4,30−33 Overall, peaks were observed
whose m/z values can be attributed
to phenazines, homoserine lactones (HSL), Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) and hydroxy-alkyl-quinolones (HAQs) that
were previously detected by various mass spectrometric methods and
are thought to participate in inter- and intraspecies cellular communication
(see Supporting Information).34 However, the same caveats regarding peak assignments
stated above for the sage leaf MS also apply to the biofilms.

peaks.

Conclusions
The LDTD-APPI method
should be useful for solid sampling in portable
ambient MS in in-field sampling of native plant2,3 or
microbial communities4−6,8 as well as other potential
applications. The feasibility of many portable MS applications is
facilitated by the availability of low cost, portable, battery-powered
diode lasers. Furthermore, the fact that LDTD-APPI gives similar results
to LAAPPI, at least for sage leaves and P. aeruginosa biofilms, argues for the use of LDTD-APPI in cases where portability
and lower cost are desirable.

The similarity of spectra is also
fundamentally interesting given
that sample volatilization in LDTD presumably occurs via thermal desorption,21 whereas LAAPPI is thought to proceed via explosive
evaporation of water that ejects a hydrated sample into the gas phase.18,35 The separation of the desorption/ablation and ionization steps indicates
that photoionization of similar volatilized species is occurring in
both LDTD-APPI and LAAPPI.

LDTD-APPI is expected to enhance
sample volatilization via thermal
heating, when compared with desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization
(DAPPI), which proceeds via a hot solvent jet impinging upon the sample.36 LDTD might also be effective when coupled to
plasma-based ion sources that are used for solid sampling,15,16,37 since LDTD might be used to reduce
fluctuations in volatilization efficiency that arise from sample heating
by the plasma, which will vary with specific plasma conditions and
source-to-sample distance.14,37 Plasma power has a
direct relationship with sample surface heating, but also affects
the extent of molecular fragmentation14 as well as ionization efficiency. It is speculated that the addition
of LDTD might be more reproducible than plasma-based ionization alone
by enhancing sample volatilization. Finally, LDTD could readily be
coupled to electrospray ionization for LDTD-ESI, a portable method
analogous to laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI).17
