A major purpose of exploratory metabolic
profiling is for the identification
of molecular species that are statistically associated with specific
biological or medical outcomes; unfortunately, the structure elucidation
process of unknowns is often a major bottleneck in this process. We
present here new holistic strategies that combine different statistical
spectroscopic and analytical techniques to improve and simplify the
process of metabolite identification. We exemplify these strategies
using study data collected as part of a dietary intervention to improve
health and which elicits a relatively subtle suite of changes from
complex molecular profiles. We identify three new dietary biomarkers
related to the consumption of peas (N-methyl nicotinic
acid), apples (rhamnitol), and onions (N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide) that
can be used to enhance dietary assessment and assess adherence to
diet. As part of the strategy, we introduce a new probabilistic statistical
spectroscopy tool, RED-STORM (Resolution EnhanceD SubseT Optimization
by Reference Matching), that uses 2D J-resolved 1H NMR spectra for enhanced information recovery using the
Bayesian paradigm to extract a subset of spectra with similar spectral
signatures to a reference. RED-STORM provided new information for
subsequent experiments (e.g., 2D-NMR spectroscopy, solid-phase extraction,
liquid chromatography prefaced mass spectrometry) used to ultimately
identify an unknown compound. In summary, we illustrate the benefit
of acquiring J-resolved experiments alongside conventional
1D 1H NMR as part of routine metabolic profiling in large
data sets and show that application of complementary statistical and
analytical techniques for the identification of unknown metabolites
can be used to save valuable time and resources.

Dietary interventions (DIs)
are a cornerstone in the management of reducing the risk of noncommunicable
diseases1−3 and promoting healthy aging.4 However, understanding the response to dietary change is compromised
by poor compliance to dietary recommendations and the inherently inaccurate
self-reporting dietary recording tools available, with prevalence
of misreporting estimated at 30–88%,5,6 lowering
the value of such studies and data

It has been demonstrated
that dietary biomarkers can reflect consumption
of specific foods and enhance dietary intake assessment at individual
and population levels.7−17 Dietary biomarkers are based on the concept that food intake is
highly correlated with excretion levels of food-related compounds
over a given period of time. These “biomarkers” can
be compounds that are excreted unchanged10,17 or that have undergone metabolic conversion, for example, by gut
bacteria.8,11,13,14 Metabolic profiling of biofluids using spectroscopic
technologies18 can detect thousands of
compounds simultaneously, generating a profile that can be related
to specific states of health or disease. Some of the compounds in
these spectral profiles are potential biomarkers of dietary intake.
However, finding associations between self-reported dietary intakes
and excreted metabolites19,20 in order to discover
potential food biomarkers is plagued by inaccuracies of self-reporting.
Thus, confirmation of a candidate biomarker is best achieved by using
a controlled food challenge with subsequent validation in a larger
population or study cohort.17

The
complementarity of the main workhorses of metabolic profiling,
one-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)
spectroscopy and hyphenated chromatograpic-mass spectrometry (MS)
techniques, has been extensively demonstrated in the past decade.21−23 However, chemical characterization of molecular species associated
with an outcome still is a limiting factor for exploratory metabolic
profiling. NMR spectroscopy provides an atom-centered spectroscopic
tool for structure elucidation that can be enhanced by statistical
spectroscopic methods24,25 or by physical hyphenation with
chromatographic methods such as solid-phase extraction (SPE),26 liquid chromatography (LC)21 or LC-NMR-MS21,27 to achieve a better
chemical characterization of endogenous and exogenous metabolites.

Metabolite identification in 1H NMR spectroscopy is
aided by the intrinsic correlation of peaks from the same metabolite.
Statistical TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (STOCSY)28 makes use of this property by calculating the correlation
between one spectral variable (driver) and all other variables to
uncover structural associations. In cases where there are sufficient
spectra, identification of 1H NMR peaks using statistical
methods is an efficient strategy that utilizes existing spectral data
without requiring additional spectroscopic experiments a priori, which has obvious advantages in usage of volume-limited samples
and is cost-efficient.23 Since the STOCSY
method was published, many derivations have aimed to improve specific
properties such as differentiation between structural and pathway
correlations by clustering, subset selection, or stoichiometric relationships.24

Statistical correlation can be undermined
by overlapped signals
unrelated to the metabolite of interest in a 1D-NMR spectrum, and
2D-NMR experiments are still required for unambiguous structure elucidation.29 In addition, the structural information obtained
using statistical algorithms is dependent on criteria such as correlation
thresholds28,30 or correlation-distance cut-offs.31 SubseT Optimization by Reference Matching (STORM)32 is a derivation of STOCSY that aims to separate
out confounding spectra that do not match a supplied reference spectrum
of a potential biomarker signal, thereby showing clearer spectral
correlations between variables for both low and high intensity signals.
The reference spectrum is a single spectrum that contains the signal
of interest. The peak segment is correlated with the same region of
all samples, and a high correlation indicates the samples contain
the same signal and are likely “informative”, whereas
samples with a low correlation do not have this signal and are uninformative.
Subsets of spectra and variable correlations are found by carefully
correcting for multiple testing in both phases and using statistical
shrinkage. Here, we describe a holistic strategy for the identification
of unknown metabolites that combines the strengths of statistical
spectroscopy, NMR, multiple separation techniques, and MS, and apply
the strategy to identify three novel dietary biomarkers. In addition,
we demonstrate an extension of STORM to 2D-NMR spectra to uncover
the identity of unknown metabolites.

Experimental Section
Food Challenges
(FCs)
For the discovery of urinary
biomarkers of peas, apples, and onions, three FCs were designed. A
total of nine healthy participants (4 women, 5 men; nonsmokers; age
22–32 years; BMI 21.2–25.3 kg/m2) were recruited
and assigned to one of the three FCs. Participants were provided with
the assigned foods as part of a standardized dinner (including 125
g of chicken breast as a protein source). Incremental amounts of the
designated food were consumed over three consecutive days: 60/120/180
g for (boiled) peas, 40/80/160 g for (raw) apples, and 20/40/60 g
for (fried) onions. For 24 h preceding the FC, and throughout the
FC, participants were asked to consume their habitual diet and avoid
consumption of coffee/tea/cocoa and any additional amounts of assigned
foods. Cumulative urine samples were collected into sterilized single-use
urine containers (International Scientific Supplies Ltd., Bradford,
U.K.) from dinner up to and including the first morning void. Urine
samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis.

Controlled
Clinical Trial (CCT)
There were 19 healthy
participants (9 women, 10 men; nonsmokers; age 25–60 years;
BMI 21.1–33.3 kg/m2) who attended the NIHR/Wellcome
Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility for four 3-day inpatient
periods, separated by a period of >4 days, with food and drink
intake
tightly controlled (alcohol/coffee/tea/cocoa were not provided). In
random order, participants followed all four DIs representing 100%
(diet 1), 75% (diet 2), 50% (diet 3), and 25% (diet 4) of WHO healthy
eating guidelines1 with respect to carbohydrates,
fats, fiber, fruits, salt, sugar, and vegetables. Full details of
the clinical trial design have been described previously.33 Foods consumed relevant to the present study
are tabulated in Supporting Information.

Each participant collected cumulative urine samples (CS)
on each day of each DI from after breakfast to before lunch (CS1),
after lunch to before dinner (CS2), and after dinner to before breakfast
the following day (CS3). The 24 h urine samples were obtained by pooling
the cumulative samples. Aliquots of urine were transferred into Eppendorf
tubes and stored at −80 °C until analysis. All participants
provided informed, written consent prior to the CCT (Registration
No. ISRCTN-43087333), which was approved by the London Brent Research
Ethics Committee (13/LO/0078). All studies were carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.

1H NMR Analysis
Aliquots of 600 μL
of urine samples were centrifuged at 16 000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. All available samples (nFC = 27, nCCT =
906, for missing CCT data see Supporting Information) were prepared for 1H NMR spectroscopy following the
protocol described in ref (34) mixing 540 μL of supernatant with 60 μL of
pH 7.4 phosphate buffer containing trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3,-2H4]-propionate as an internal reference
standard (“NMR buffer”). Water-suppressed 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed at 300 K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer
(Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany) using a standard 1D pulse sequence
(RD–gz,1–90°–t–90°–tm–gz,2–90°–ACQ)
with saturation of the water resonance.7 The following abbreviations apply: RD is the relaxation delay, t is a short delay (4 μs), 90° represents a radio
frequency (RF) pulse that tips the magnetization by 90°, tm is the mixing time (10 ms), gz,1 and gz,2 are magnetic field z-gradients
both applied for 1 ms, and ACQ is the data acquisition period of 2.73
s. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using 4 dummy scans and
32 scans, and 64K time domain points, with a spectral window of 20
ppm. Prior to Fourier transformation, free induction decays were multiplied
by an exponential function corresponding to a line broadening of 0.3
Hz. 1H NMR spectra were normalized to the total urine volume
to correct for differences in dilution.

1H–1H 2D J-resolved experiments7 were acquired using a pulse sequence to detect the J-couplings in the second dimension, with suppression of
the water resonance (RD–90°–t1– 180°–t1–ACQ),
where t1 is an incremented time period,
RD is 2 s, 180° represents a 180° RF pulse, and ACQ is 0.41
s. J-resolved spectra were acquired using 16 dummy
scans and 2 scans, 8K points with spectral window of 16.7 ppm for
f2 and 40 increments with spectral window of 78 Hz for f1. Continuous
wave irradiation was applied at the water resonance frequency using
a 25 Hz RF during the RD. A sine-bell apodization function was applied
to f2 and a squared sine-bell to f1 of the J-resolved
data, followed by Fourier transformation, tilting by 45°, and
symmetrization along f1 before data analysis.

A suite of 2D-NMR
experiments including 1H–1H TOtal Correlation
SpectroscopY (TOCSY), 1H–1H COrrelation
SpectroscopY (COSY), 1H–13C Heteronuclear
Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC), and 1H–13C Heteronuclear Multiple-Bond Correlation
(HMBC) spectroscopy were used for identification purposes.25,29

SPE-NMR
Apple extracts were homogenized using a Kenwood
KMix Blender for 5 min. The puree obtained was filtered using a stainless
steel filter and centrifuged for 10 min at 16 000 × g. A 2 mL portion of each sample (urine/apple) was lyophilized
overnight. Freeze-dried (FD) urine/apple samples were dissolved in
1 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.5 and briefly sonicated prior
to being loaded onto a 100 mg/mL Bond Elut phenylboronic acid (PBA)
SPE-cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Stockport, U.K.). The SPE-cartridge
was conditioned with 1 mL of 70:30 v/v H2O/ACN, and 0.1
M HCl, followed by 1 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 10. After conditioning,
the sample was loaded onto the SPE-cartridge. The loaded sample was
washed with 2 mL of 50:50 v/v ACN/sodium phosphate (10 mM) pH 8.5.
The sample was eluted using 1 mL of acidified solutions (0.1 M HCl)
of 100% H2O, 90:10 v/v H2O/ACN, and 70:30 v/v
H2O/ACN and subsequently lyophilized until dry. The dried
eluent fractions were reconstituted in 540 μL of H2O and 60 μL of NMR buffer, vortexed, and centrifuged prior
to NMR analysis.

LC-NMR-MS27
A 5 mL portion
of urine collected overnight after consumption of onion was lyophilized
overnight, reconstituted in 500 μL of the original urine sample,
and vortexed, sonicated and centrifuged (20 min at 16 000 × g). The supernatant was repeatedly injected (7 × 2
μL) onto a reversed-phase HPLC column (Waters Atlantis-T3, 3
μm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm at 30 °C) in a Waters Acquity
UPLC comprising a binary solvent manager and photodiode array detector
with a Waters CTC autosampler with 100 μL sampling needle, and
eluted at 0.8 mL/min using the following gradient: 0.0–60.0
min (99.9:0.1% H2O/formic acid), 60.01–65.0 min
(99.9:0.1% methanol/formic acid), 65.01–127.5 min (99.9:0.1%
H2O/formic acid). The chromatographic separation of the
sample was fractionated using a Waters Fraction Collector III. A total
of 120 fractions were collected, one every 29 s (starting at t = 5 min, finishing at t = 63 min), and
dried under a stream of nitrogen. Each fraction was redissolved in
540 μL of H2O and 60 μL of NMR buffer and analyzed
by 1H NMR. A volume of 50 μL of the fraction containing
the unknown metabolite was analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS, Waters
Acquity Ultra Performance LC system coupled to Xevo G2 Q-TOF mass
spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA), following an established metabolic
profiling method.35 The optimized capillary
voltage, cone voltage, and collision energy were 3 kV/20 V/4 V for
ESI+ and 1.5 kV/30 V/6 V for ESI–, using a source temperature
of 120 °C and desolvation temperature of 600 °C. Desolvation
was 1000L/h for both, and cone gas flows were 50 L/h (ESI+) and 150
L/h (ESI−). Leucine enkephalin was used as the reference lock
mass at 556.2771 ([M + H]+) and 554.2615 ([M – H]−).

RED-STORM Algorithm
Here, STORM
was extended in a probabilistic
framework and modified for applicability to 2D data to provide a clearer
signature of structural correlations in the data, and the extended
algorithm was named Resolution EnhanceD SubseT Optimization by Reference
Matching (RED-STORM).

High correlations in the data are of interest
between samples and a reference spectrum of a signal of interest (for
subset optimization) and between a driver and all other variables
(for assessing variable importance). However, high correlations are
not normally distributed because of the upper bound on the correlation
([−1, 1]); this results in their distributions being negatively
skewed. Therefore, the correlation (ρ) is transformed to a Fisher z-score, which results in approximately normally distributed
data that can be analyzed using parametric methods: 1  Next, the distribution of all z-scores
is modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). A GMM is
a weighted sum of k Gaussian clusters and is defined
as 2  Here, z has n data points. μ
are the k means and σ2 the k variances. π is the mixture
weights for each of k Gaussians (∑ j = 1kπj = 1), and φ0,1 is a normalized Gaussian distribution with specified μ
and σ. In order to obtain clusters of variables from the Fisher z-transformed correlations, a parameter-free GMM is used.36 The model automatically learns the optimal number
of clusters from the data. For completeness, a description of the
method in brief follows; for mathematical proofs, see ref (36).

Each cluster mean
(μj) and precision
(σj–2) from eq 2 are given Gaussian (p(μj|λ, r) ∼ φ0,1(λ, r–1)) and Gamma (p(σj–2|γ, β) ∼
Γ(γ, β–1)) priors, respectively.
Here, λ and r are hyperparameters for the means
of all clusters. Similarly, γ (shape) and β (scale) are
hyperparameters for the cluster precisions. The hyperparameters themselves
are initialized from the observation mean (μz) and variance (σz2) as vague priors (p(λ) ∼ φ0,1(μz, σz2); p(r) ∼ Γ(1, σz2); p(γ–1) ∼ Γ(1,
1); p(β) ∼ Γ(1, σz–2)). The posterior distributions of the
cluster means are obtained from 3  where z̃j is the sum of observations from cluster j, mj the number
of observations with highest probability for cluster j, ci the cluster with
highest probability for observation i, and δci,j a Kronecker delta product. Similarly, the posterior distributions
of the cluster precisions are obtained from 4  The posteriors for λ (), r (), and β () are obtained similarly
to the priors,
whereas posterior for γ takes a different form and makes use
of the fact that p(ln(γ)|σ–2, β) is log-concave:36 5  Each ci is directly related to π and can be written
in terms
of k and mj with concentration hyperparameter α (). The prior for α is sampled
from
an inverse Gamma distribution (p(α–1) ∼ Γ(1, 1)) and the posterior from . The “doubling and shrinkage”
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) slice sampler37 is used to generate independent samples from the nonstandard distributions
for γ and α.

The posterior of observation i given class j is 6  The same goes for a potential
new cluster
(k + 1), where the mean and precision are sampled
from Gaussian and Gamma distributions using the posteriors from global
hyperparameters λ, r, γ, and β
(p(μk+1|λ, r) ∼ φ0,1(λ, r–1),p(σk+1–2|γ, β) ∼ Γ(γ,
β–1)) and the posterior is as above (class j is now k + 1).

The cumulative sum
of the cluster probabilities (Cj) for ci are calculated
(Cj = ∑i = 1jp(ci = j|j ≤ k + 1)), and a new cluster is
added if and only if none of the previous k clusters
pass an arbitrary threshold of the cumulative sum of the new cluster
(); otherwise, ci becomes the first cluster
to pass the threshold.
At any stage when any mj = 0, cluster j is removed.

This process is
repeated for a set number of (burn-in) iterations
(typically >100) to achieve some stability in finding a suitable k, depending on the data, before continuing with the remainder
of (post burn-in) iterations of the Markov-chain. The final predictive
distribution is a weighted average over the post burn-in iteration
clusters. The order (for i of z)
is randomized in each iteration to avoid bias.

For subset selection,
the variables that make up the reference
segment of interest are correlated with the same variables from all
spectra (STORM); the correlations are z-transformed,
and the distribution is fitted using the procedure described above.
The final predictive distribution is converted to a cumulative distribution
function (cdf), and for each sample the probability of it resembling
the reference is calculated. The subset contains all spectra that
satisfy p(zi|cdf) ≥ ts, where ts is a user-defined
threshold for the samples. The reference spectrum is updated by using
a weighted average of the spectra in the subset. Using only the spectra
in the subset, the correlations of all driver variables (reference
segment of interest) with all other spectral variables are calculated.
To alleviate the computational load of the algorithm, for 2D J-resolved NMR, and other 2D-spectra, the algorithm is run
on the variables that make up the peaks of the reference spectrum
rather than all variables. The median ρ across all driver variables
is calculated for each variable and z-transformed,
and the same procedure as for subset selection is performed for the
variables. MATLAB code can be obtained by contacting the authors.

Results and Discussion
Identification of a Urinary Biomarker for
Pea (Pisum
sativum) Consumption
On comparison of the urinary
spectra obtained pre- and postpea intake, the urinary concentration
of N-methylnicotinic acid (NMNA, trigonelline), although
present in the baseline samples, showed a dose dependent increment
after increasing the consumption of peas (Figure 1A–C) during the FC, suggesting it
as a candidate biomarker. However, the presence of NMNA in the baseline
samples indicated that peas were not the sole source of NMNA. The
CCT data showed a similar pattern (Figure 1D–F) with low levels for diet 1 (no
peas provided) and incrementally higher levels for diets 2–4
(peas provided). Interestingly, NMNA appears in highest concentrations
in CS3 and 24 h samples from diet 2, whereas peas were provided only
during dinner in increasing amounts (0/20/40/60 g for diets 1–4).
However, chocolate was provided as an afternoon snack in diets 1–3,
and baked beans were provided as part of dinner in diet 2 (see Supporting
Information Table S1) which may be alternative
sources of NMNA.

Figure 1 FC and CCT spectra identify NMNA as a urinary biomarker
of peas.

samples of one CCT volunteer zoomed in on the same regions.

It has been long known that several
plant materials (including
coffee, tea, and cocoa) are rich in niacin (vitamin B3) and some of
its major metabolic products,38 including
NMNA. In addition, NMNA has been proposed as urinary biomarker of
coffee consumption.11 Thus, although it
is a poor biomarker of pea intake in the sense of specificity, NMNA
could still be used to detect pea intake in urine after controlling
for other sources.

With nonspecific dietary biomarkers, biomarker
patterns, rather
than a single biomarker, can be used to differentiate between different
food sources.17 For instance, 2-furoylglycine,
another marker of coffee consumption,16 can be used to cross-check for coffee consumption and as secondary
marker to adjust the concentration of NMNA. Broader knowledge of dietary
biomarkers will contribute to solving this specificity issue.

Identification
of Urinary Biomarker of Apple (Malus
domestica) Consumption
After consumption of increased
amounts of apple, a spectral signal at δ 1.285 was found to
be increased (Figure 2A). This same signal was found in incrementally higher levels in
the urine of participants who consumed increasing amounts of apple
during the CCT (Figure 2B); diets 2–4 contained 50/100/150 g of apple, respectively,
as a midmorning snack. The absence of this signal in urine samples
from participants on diet 1 is consistent with there being no apple
intake in diet 1. STORM analysis (Figure 2C) revealed high correlations of the driver
(δ 1.285) with a shoulder of the 3-hydroxyisovalerate peak at
δ 1.275(s), suggesting the singlet may in fact be a doublet.
This was confirmed using J-resolved spectroscopy
(Figure 2D). To confirm
the identity of the molecule giving rise to the doublet, we performed
SPE using a PBA-cartridge on both the urine (Figure 2E) and apple puree (Figure 2F) samples to isolate the signal in one of
the fractions for identification purposes, which was subsequently
confirmed by NMR analysis. To assess the specificity of this doublet
to apple consumption, we performed PBA-SPE on urine samples post-pear-consumption
(using the same protocol as for apple) and did not find the metabolite
peak in the urine or in any fraction (Figure 2G). 2D-NMR experiments were performed on
fraction 1 (Supporting Information) suggesting
rhamnitol as potential biomarker; a chemical spike-in experiment (Figure 2H) confirmed the
identity. Rhamnitol is a component in different varieties of apples,39 and taken together, these results confirm rhamnitol
as specific biomarker for apple consumption. The suitability of rhamnitol
for quantification of apple intake will be investigated in a follow-up
study.

as a biomarker of apple consumption. (A) 1H NMR spectrum

Proof-of-Concept of RED-STORM
The identification of
rhamnitol as urinary biomarker of apple consumption has shown how
overlap in 1D spectra cannot be resolved using STORM as the signals
overlap with those of 3-hydroxyisovalerate, commonly found in urine
samples, which reduces the power of the statistical correlation method. J-resolved NMR spectra are able to “untangle”
overlap using the J-coupling as the second dimension.
In large metabolic profiling studies, both standard one-dimensional 1H NMR and J-resolved experiments are commonly
run together, since the J-resolved acquisition only
adds 5 min to the total acquisition time. While standard 1D 1H NMR spectra are commonly used for data analysis, the corresponding J-resolved spectra can be used for identification purposes.

Here, we illustrate the benefit of using RED-STORM (see Experimental Section for algorithm) over STORM using
a well-known dietary biomarker as example. N-Acetyl-S-methyl-cysteine-sulfoxide (NAcSMCSO) is the major urinary
metabolite after consumption of cruciferous and other vegetables.14 Edmands et al. have shown that the methyl-sulfoxide
signal correlates mostly with the intake of its substrate, and component
of cruciferous vegetables, SMCSO, and two other metabolic products,
but intramolecular correlations driven from the δ 2.78 peak
of NAcSMCSO were weaker than those observed between the methyl-sulfoxide
signals of other related molecules. This can also been seen in our
data (Figure 3A,B).
Our data comes from a diverse set of samples, of which only some contain
metabolic products of broccoli consumption. Here STORM was not able
to uncover the structural correlations, possibly due to overlap with
more intense signals and the overall high variability of samples compared
with the study by Edmands et al. (high/low consumers of cruciferous
vegetables). The application of RED-STORM to two-dimensional J-resolved spectra of the same individuals, however, clearly
showed some intramolecular structural correlations, which were stronger
than correlations between NAcSMCSO and other SMCSO-metabolites (Figure 3C). The chemical
shifts identified (δ 4.38 (m) and δ 3.10 (m), with probability
>0.99) indeed come from the same metabolite;14 however, δ 3.30 (m) was not observed as its signals
are heavily
overlapped with other multiplets (such as methylhistidines) in the
same region.

Complementarity of Statistical and Analytical
Platforms for
Identification of a Urinary Biomarker of Onion (Allium cepa) Consumption
Previously, dimethylsulfone (δ 3.16
(s)) had been proposed as biomarker of onion consumption.9 However, it has two major disadvantages; first,
it is only a singlet, and thus assignment can be ambiguous, but second,
and more importantly, the chemical shift of dimethylsulfone is in
a region of the NMR spectrum where there are many other di- and trimethyl
signals that may confound this metabolite identification. Through
an FC we have identified a tentative novel biomarker of onion consumption,
which is a multiplet signal at δ 1.97 (dd) (Figure 4A). The presence of this onion-related
signal was confirmed using the CCT samples (Figure 4B). STORM analysis using the peak at δ
1.97 as the driver (Figure 3C) clearly shows 3 other correlated signals (δ 2.03
(s), δ 6.50 (m), and δ 6.65 (m)). Due to the clear multiplet
structure, we applied RED-STORM on the J-resolved
spectra and discovered additional signals (δ 3.44 (m) and δ
4.44 (m)) with a high probability of being intramolecular (>0.97)
(Figure 4E).

of RED-STORM for identification of NMR signals tentatively
associated with onion consumption. (A) Section of 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra from one volunteer after the onion FC shows a characteristic
multiplet. (B) Same section of 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra of
different samples of one volunteer in the CCT. (C) STORM analysis

of samples resembling the reference signal (x-axis)
versus the percentage (y-axis) of samples from each
type of urine collection in the CCT. It reveals that specific samples
of certain diets (CS3 and 24 h urine samples of the two healthiest
diets and a minor amount in CS2 of diet 3) contain the unknown metabolite.
(E) RED-STORM identifies two more multiplets compared to STORM (C)
visualized in the J-resolved pseudospectrum.

To illustrate how the process
for subset selection works, we show
the distribution fitting procedure of RED-STORM on the z-transformed correlations of all J-resolved spectra
(n = 906) with the reference spectrum of the metabolite
of interest (Supporting Information Figure S8). There appear to be two main clusters of sample–reference
correlations that follow different Gaussian distributions. After completion,
the samples with p(zi|cdf) ≥ 0.5 were included in the subset (n = 320). Inspection of the relation between p(zi|cdf) and the percentage
of samples from each unique type of urine sample (collection time,
diet) that pass a certain threshold (Figure 4D) gives a very clear indication that the
metabolite is found mostly in CS3 and 24 h samples of diets 3 and
4. Small amounts of onions (20 g and 40 g for diets 3 and 4, respectively)
were consumed with dinner (matching the presence of the unknown metabolite
in CS3) in both of these diets. While no onion was provided in diets
1 and 2, it is interesting to see that the CS2 sample from diet 2
also appeared to contain low levels of this metabolite. On further
inspection of the dietary composition, onion traces were found to
be present in the sausage casserole that was provided to the CCT volunteers
(in diet 2) for lunch.

Using the subset with the highest signal-to-noise
of the unknown
compound (n = 320), the reference is updated. The z-transformed correlations of the driver peak (δ 1.97
(dd)) with all spectral peaks were calculated, and the resulting distribution
was fitted (Supporting Information Figure S9); here, most of the z-scores tend to follow a Gaussian
distribution around 0, and only a few have higher z-scores. It is these z-transformed correlations
that are likely structural or otherwise closely related to the multiplet
of interest; the resulting cdf then gives the result as shown in Figure 4E.

STORM found
4 peaks associated with the driver; the J-coupling
constants of the three multiplet signals indicated these
were adjacent. RED-STORM identified an additional 2 multiplets which
were in regions with overlap in the 1H NMR spectrum; however,
measurement of the J-couplings (δ 4.44 (m):
9.78, 8.20, and 4.21 Hz; δ 3.44 (m), 13.38, and 4.21 Hz) indicated
at least one undiscovered peak. In order to uncover the complete structure,
we then employed analytical methods for further structure elucidation.
First, we used a urine sample, taken after a volunteer ate 90 g (dry
weight) of (fried) onions over dinner, to obtain a concentrated amount
of the unknown metabolite and performed LC coupled to 1H NMR to isolate the compound in an LC-fraction (Figure 5A). The full 1H
NMR spectrum of the fraction (Figure 5B) was able to uncover two more signals (δ 3.28
(dd); δ 8.30 with a weak doublet-like splitting) matching with
previously measured J-couplings. Analysis of the
fraction using LC-MS (ESI+) provided a likely chemical formula of
the unknown metabolite of interest, C8H13NO4S (Figure 5C). Using additional 2D-NMR experiments the signals could now be
properly assigned (Figure 5D) which resulted in the identification of the complete structure
(Figure 5E) of the
onion biomarker: N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide (NAcSPCSO).

To the best of our knowledge,
this metabolite has not been reported
before. On the basis of its structure, we assume that it is a direct
metabolite of S-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide (SPCSO).
SPCSO is the major flavor precursor in Allium cepa(40) and precursor to the main lachrymatory
factor (Z)-propanethial-sulfoxide.41 However, NAcSPCSO does not appear to be the product of
any of the known (degradation) pathways in the genus Allium,42 and we hypothesize that it is produced
by means of an N-acetyltransferase acetyl-CoA conjugation
mechanism, analogous to the production of NAcSMCSO.14 However, SMCSO is not specific for cruciferous vegetables,
and can also be found in certain Allium species (including
onion). However, SPCSO is specific for A. ascalonicum (shallot), A. cepa, A. nutans (chives),
and A. schoenoprasum (chives).40,42

The integrated analytical and statistical two-dimensional
spectroscopy
strategy for metabolite identification outperforms existing strategies,
such as STOCSY and STORM, by utilizing the full resolution J-resolved spectra including the J-coupling
constants to allow detection of extra signals attributed to intramolecular
correlations. Further clarity on structural assignment is provided
by the differentiation of intra- and intermolecular connectivities,
not easily differentiated by the basic statistical spectroscopy methods.
Thus, identification of NAcSPCSO was only possible through the use
of the novel structural elucidation pathway presented here combining
statistical and analytical techniques.

Conclusions
Successful
structure elucidation of unknown metabolites relies
on a combination of the most suitable statistical and analytical strategies
and is dependent on metabolite concentration and excretion kinetics,
overlap of spectral peaks, and chemical characteristics of the compound.
The newly introduced statistical spectroscopy tool, RED-STORM, is
able to extract information about potential biomarkers that STORM
and other statistical spectroscopy methods cannot provide from 1D-NMR
data. Moreover, RED-STORM does not rely on arbitrary correlation-type
thresholds28,30,31 or multiple testing adjusted P-values,32 but learns probabilities from the distribution
of these data and is therefore less affected by sample size,43 and the effects of normalization and scaling,44 than frequentist methods can be. RED-STORM highlights
the added benefit of acquiring J-resolved experiments
alongside conventional 1H NMR data as part of metabolic
profiling analytical routines.34 Statistical
spectroscopy tools can help narrow down the number of analytical experiments
that need to be performed (saving time and money). However, for biomarker
identification purposes they should not be used by themselves as we
have shown that analytical experiments on selected samples can provide
information that cannot be gathered using statistical means alone.
These analytical experiments are ideally limited to performing a chemical
spike-in experiment, but often traditional analytical tools (freeze-drying,
SPE-NMR,26 LC-fractionation27) are required in order to isolate the unknown
metabolite for further study and confirmation by 2D-NMR and MS. As
a result of performing three FCs and combining a suite of statistical
and analytical tools, we were able to identify new dietary biomarkers
for pea, apple, and onion. These were subsequently validated in an
in-patient randomized CCT33 where all food
and drink was fully controlled. Specific dietary biomarkers, such
as rhamnitol (apple) and N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide (onion), can be
used to assess adherence to diet and/or to increase the accuracy of
self-reported dietary records that suffer from misreporting issues.
