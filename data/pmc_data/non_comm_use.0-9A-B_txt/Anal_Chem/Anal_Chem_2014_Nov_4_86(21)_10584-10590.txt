The study of N-linked glycans is
among the most challenging bioanalytical
tasks because of their complexity and variety. The presence of glycoform
families that differ only in branching and/or linkage position makes
the identification and quantitation of individual glycans exceedingly
difficult. Quantitation of these individual glycans is important because
changes in the abundance of these isomers are often associated with
significant biomedical events. For instance, previous studies have
shown that the ratio of α2-3 to α2-6 linked sialic acid
(SA) plays an important role in cancer biology. Consequently, quantitative
methods to detect alterations in the ratios of glycans based on their
SA linkages could serve as a diagnostic tool in oncology, yet traditional
glycomic profiling cannot readily differentiate between these linkage
isomers. Here, we present a liquid chromatography-selected reaction
monitoring (LC-SRM) approach that we demonstrate is capable of quantitating
the individual SA linkage
isomers. The LC method is capable of separating sialylated N-glycan
isomers differing in α2-3 and α2-6 linkages using a novel
superficially porous particle (Fused-Core) Penta-HILIC (hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography) column. SRM detection provides
the relative quantitation of each SA linkage isomer, and minimizes
interferences from coeluting glycans that are problematic for UV/Fluorescence
based quantitation. With our approach, the relative quantitation of
each SA linkage isomer is obtained from a straightforward liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment.

==== Body
Glycosylation
is one of the
most common and complex protein post-translational modifications.
The glycosylation pattern of proteins depends on multiple factors,
including enzyme activity, nucleotide sugar availability, kinetics
of glycoconjugate transport, and cell type/stage. Alterations in glycan
structures are associated with various pathologies such as cancer
and inflammation,1 and thus the detection
of these changes offers the potential of being used for diagnostic
and prognostic purposes.

A family of acidic 9-carbon sugars,
which are known as sialic acids
(SAs),2 have attracted great attention
due to the recognition of their biological functions.3 Previous studies have shown that the degree of sialylation
affects the half-lives of many circulating glycoproteins and plays
critical roles in a variety of biological processes, such as cell–cell
communication, cell matrix interaction, adhesion, and protein targeting.4−6 Usually, SAs are found as terminal sugars on many of the oligosaccharides
attached to proteins or lipids. In mammalian cells, the most common
SAs are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic
acid (Neu5Gc); of these, only the former is present in normal human
cells.7,8 The structural diversity of SAs arises not
only from different types of SAs but also from their linkage to the
underlying glycan residues. Typically, SAs can be attached to a galactose
(Gal) residue via α2-3 or α2-6 linkages or attached to
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) via an α2-6 linkage.9 In addition, SAs can also be attached to another
SA residue via an α2-8 linkage.10 These linkage configurations are regulated by the transferring enzymes,
sialyltransferases (STs).

There are approximately 20 different
STs, which can be classified
into four groups according to the linkages through which they attach
SAs to the glycan residue, including ST3Gal, ST6Gal (α2,6-ST),
ST6GalNAc, and ST8Sia (α2,8-ST).10 The abbreviated key for this ST nomenclature is the linkage position
(i.e., 3, 6, 8) followed by the monosaccharide onto which the SA is
transferred (i.e., Gal, GlcNAc, SA). In other words, ST3Gal would
be the term for a transferase that attaches a SA via an α2-3
linkage to a galactose residue. Among the STs, ST6Gal-1 is probably
the most studied due to its biological significance and its relationship
to cancer.11 Evidence shows that the proteins
on the cell surface undergo an increased level of α2-6 linked
sialylation on galactose residues during tumor progression,12 which is correlated to the increased expression
of ST6Gal-1.13-16 Hence, the altered ratio of α2-3/2-6 can be used as an indicator
for diagnostic purposes.

Mass spectrometry (MS) has been an
enabling technology in glycomics.17,18 Although mass
spectrometry can provide extensive information on
structure and quantity, MS glycomics profiling has difficulty quantitating
linkage isomers, such as those resulting from SA α2-3/2-6 linkages,
particularly when multiple species are present.19 The MSn spectra of the sialylated
glycans are typically dominated by the loss of the labile SAs, which
makes assigning the SA linkage assignment difficult and precludes
the ability to quantitate the amounts of the linkage isomers when
multiple species are present at the same mass.20 Several groups have proposed techniques to overcome this
issue with quantitation of SA linkage isomers. To differentiate these
linkage isomers, Mechref et al. have described the formation of diagnostic
ions by tandem MS of permethylated oligosaccharides specific to SA
with α2-6 linkage.21 Alley and Novotny
have reported a method that involves the selective amidation of α2-6
linked SAs, which causes the α2-3 linked SAs to undergo spontaneous
lactonization. Followed by permethylation, the α2-6 linked SA
gives a mass shift of 13 Da over SA attached via α2-3 linkage,
which can be easily distinguished by MS.19 These methods require extensive chemical derivatization for sample
preparation.

Liquid chromatography (LC) is a useful addition
to the MS-based
glycomics techniques due to its ability to separate glycan isomers,
and thus offers great potential for the characterization/quantitation
of individual glycans. Various separation techniques have demonstrated
the ability to resolve isomeric N-glycans, both in their native and
derivatized forms, using normal-phase,22 porous graphitized carbon (PGC)23 and
reversed-phase24 liquid chromatography.
Recently, Hincapie has reported the separation of isomeric sialylated
N-glycans by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)
combined with a linkage specific derivatization.25 In this work, the derivatization of SAs is not only essential
to identify the isomers due to the linkage specific reactions but
also important to separate the linkage specific subpopulations of
those highly sialylated N-glycans by HILIC. The routine chromatographic
separation of SA linkage isomers has not currently been achieved without
linkage specific chemistry.

Here, we present an LC-selected
reaction monitoring (SRM) approach
that enables quantitation of the individual SA linkage isomers. We
have developed a chromatographic method capable of separating the
sialylated N-glycan α2-3 and α2-6 linkage isomers using
a novel superficially porous particle (Fused-Core) Penta-HILIC column.
Exoglycosidase digestion confirmed the identity of each N-glycan isomer
from a standard glycoprotein. Quantitation of the linkage isomers
is provided by interfacing the LC to a Q-Trap MS detector that was
operated in SRM mode, which minimized interferences from the coeluting
glycans that caused problems with UV/Fluoresence based quantitation.
This straightforward LC-MS experiment provides the relative quantitation
of each SA linkage isomer.

Experimental Section
Materials
Bovine
fetuin, human serum, trypsin (TPCK
treated), procainamide hydrochloride, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
were purchased from Sigma. Ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium formate,
formic acid (for LC-MS), and sodium cyanoborohydride were purchased
from Fluka. PNGase F (Glycerol free) was purchased from New England
Biolabs (NEB). Sialidase S (recombinant from Streptococcus
pneumonia expressed in Escherichia
coli) was purchased from Prozyme. Acetonitrile (ACN,
HPLC grade) was purchased from Fisher. Octadecyl (C18) disposable
extraction columns were purchased from J.T. Baker. PD MiniTrap G-10
was purchased from GE Healthcare. Other reagents were analytical grade.

N-Glycan Release and Purification
Bovine fetuin (200
μg) was dissolved in 200 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate,
pH = 7.8. For human serum, a 50 μL aliquot was mixed with 50
mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH = 7.8. Both sample solutions were heated
at 100 °C for 5 min to denature the protein. Trypsin digestion
was carried out at 37 °C overnight with an adjusted enzyme amount
(a 10 μL aliquot for fetuin or 100 μL aliquot for serum
of a 1 μg/μL trypsin in the buffer solution). The trypsin
was then deactivated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. For N-glycan
release, a l μL and 4 μL aliquot of PNGase F (used as
received from NEB at 500 000 U/mL) was added to the fetuin
sample and the human serum sample, respectively. After incubation
at 37 °C overnight, the released N-glycans were separated from
peptides and undigested proteins by reverse-phase liquid chromatography
with a C18 SPE column. Specifically, the PNGase F digests were loaded
onto a C18-Sep-Pac, which had been pre-equilibrated in 5% acetic acid.
The column was washed with 3 mL of 5% acetic acid; the N-glycans were
present in the flow-through, which was collected, frozen, and lyophilized
to dryness.

Procainamide (ProA) Labeling of Free N-Glycans
The
labeling of the glycans was carried out by following Klapoetke’s
procedure26 with a modification for the
sialylated glycans.27 The labeling solution
was prepared fresh with 108 mg/mL procainamide hydrochloride, and
63 mg/mL sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) in DMSO/acetic
acid at a ratio of 7:3 by volume. A 20 μL aliquot of the labeling
solution was added to the fetuin sample and 40 μL to the serum
sample. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight in darkness.
Excess labeling reagent was removed using the MiniTrap G-10 size exclusion
columns following the user’s guide of this product. The fraction
containing the fluorescently labeled N-glycans was lyophilized and
stored at −20 °C pending analysis.

HILIC Separation of ProA
Labeled N-Glycans
This study
utilized a Nexera UFLC (Shimadzu) LC system and Halo Penta-HILIC columns
(Advanced Materials Technology, 2.1 mm × 15 cm, 2.7 μm
particle size, Wilmington, DE). The separation was carried out at
a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 60 °C with a mobile phase A consisting
of 95% H2O/ACN with 50 mM ammonium formate (adjusted to
pH 4.4 with formic acid) and mobile phase B being pure ACN. A linear
gradient of 78% mobile phase B to 48% mobile phase B in 75 min was
utilized. The UV absorbance signal for the ProA tag was detected at
a wavelength of 300 nm. In most cases, the absorbance detector was
operated in series with the MS detector. A small ID (50 μm ×
20 cm PEEK-Sil) tube connected the flow cell to the MS interface.
One fiftieth of the sample dissolved in 78% ACN was injected for each
experiment. With the fetuin sample, fractions were collected based
on individual peaks observed from an UV detector. After the samples
were dried in a Speed-vac (Thermo/Savant), the fractions were stored
at −20 °C pending exoglycosidase study to determine the
isomer linkages of SAs.

SRM Detection of Chromatographically Resolved
Isomers
MS analysis was performed on a 4000 Q-Trap (AB SCIEX)
mass spectrometer.
An initial LC-MS experiment, where ions were detected across the 700–2000 m/z range, was performed on each sample
to determine the most abundant molecular ion species for each glycan.
These values, listed in Table 1, were used
as the precursor ions for the SRM experiments. MS/MS experiments performed
on the ProA-labeled N-glycans revealed that each of these glycans
produced an intense fragment ion at m/z 441.4, which corresponded to the GlcNAc derivatized with the ProA
tag. This fragment ion was used in the SRM experiment for all of the
labeled N-glycans. As a side note, the high abundance of this fragment
ion was expected because of the high gas-phase basicity associated
with the tertiary amine on the ProA tag. A series of experiments was
performed and led to the conclusion that a collision energy (CE) of
70 V and declustering potential (DP) of 40 V were optimal. The dwell
time was set at 100 ms with unit resolution in both Q1 and Q3 mass
selectors.

Exoglycosidase Digestion for SA Linkage Identification with
Fetuin N-Glycans
To confirm the separation of SA linkage
isomers, fractions collected from the fetuin sample were digested
with sialidase S, an exoglycosidase that specifically releases α2-3
linked SA residues. For this digestion, each of the dried fractions
was dissolved in 14 μL of Nanopure water, then 4 μL of
5× Reaction Buffer B (as received) and 2 μL of sialidase
S (at 5 U/mL) were added to the mixture to give a total volume of
20 μL. The digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 2 h.
After digestion, each reaction solution was frozen and lyophilized
to dryness and then redissolved in 78% ACN/H2O for LC/MS
analysis with the same experimental conditions described above.

Results and Discussion
Fetuin N-Glycan Separation with the Penta-HILIC
Columns
Fetuin is a standard glycoprotein that has a variety
of well-characterized
glycoforms, which consists predominantly of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary
N-glycans possessing variable degrees of sialylation.20,28,29 The HILIC separation of the ProA-labeled
N-glycans from fetuin contained 21 abundant chromatographically resolved
peaks (Figure 1A). Comparing the observed masses
from the LC-MS experiment to those reported previously,30,31 glycan compositions could be assigned for each peak (Table S-1, Supporting Information). For example, the m/z value obtained over peak 1 corresponds
with a biantennary N-glycan with two SAs, which is abbreviated as
Bi-2SA. LC-MS analysis identified 8 unique compositions in 21 chromatographic
peaks. Four compositions (Bi-2SA, Tri-2SA, Tri-3SA, and Tri-4SA) are
found in 13 individual peaks, which are represented in blue, red,
green, and gray, respectively in the SRM traces (Figure 1B). It is noteworthy that there are some minor peaks in blue
and red underneath the most abundant green peaks, which presumably
result from the loss of SAs by in-source fragmentation. A reasonable
explanation for the observation of multiple peaks with the same composition
was that the SA α2-3/α2-6 linkage isomers were being resolved
with the HILIC separation. To confirm our hypothesis, each of these
peaks was collected and further characterized by exoglycosidase digestion
with subsequent LC-MS analysis.

for peaks 1 through 21 and subjected individually to exoglycosidase

compositions from the same fetuin sample, indicating the Bi-2SA (blue),
Tri-2SA (red), Tri-3SA (green), and Tri-4SA (gray).

A series of exoglycosidase digestion studies were
performed to
confirm that the multitude of chromatographic peaks from glycans with
the same apparent composition resulted from different linkage isomers.
Each of the isolated fetuin fractions was subjected to digestion with
Sialidase S, which should exclusively cleave α2-3 linked SA
from the nonreducing termini. Each digested fraction was analyzed
by LC-SRM using the same LC gradient as the original separation and
the SRM transitions listed in Table S-2 (Supporting
Information). For instance, the extracted LC-SRM trace for
the Bi-2SA N-glycans (m/z at 1222.1)
from whole fetuin sample includes three individual peaks at 33.2,
34.8, and 36.3 min (Figure 2A). LC-SRM analysis
of the earliest eluting Bi-2SA glycoform after exoglycosidase digestion
revealed that the original peak at 33.2 min had disappeared and was
replaced by a new peak at 24.3 min (Figure 2B). The SRM data indicated that the glycan in this new peak corresponded
to a biantennary structure with no SAs. This result indicates that
both of the SAs on this N-glycan have attachment through α2-3
linkages. Analysis of the second Bi-2SA fraction after digestion once
again revealed the disappearance of the original peak, the appearance
of a new peak at 31.5 min (Figure 2C), and
the mass of the new glycan corresponding to a Bi-SA structure. Consequently,
the N-glycan present in this fraction was found to have one SA attached
through an α2-3 linkage (released by sialidase S digestion)
and one SA attached through an α2-6 linkage (resistant to sialidase
S digestion). The glycan in the last Bi-2A fraction was not affected
by the Sialidase S digestion (Figure 2D), which
indicated that both SAs are attached via α2-6 linkages. Combined,
these results indicate that each of the fractions contains a different
SA linkage isomer(s) and the three fractions correspond to Bi-2SA(3,3),
Bi-2SA(3,6), and Bi-2SA(6,6) listed in order from the shortest to
longest retention time. Similar experiments were conducted on the
fractionated Tri-2SA, Tri-3SA, and Tri-4SA N-glycans, and the SA linkage
identifications also demonstrated the retention pattern of the SA
α2-3 isomer eluting before the corresponding an α2-6 isomer.
The three isomeric structures observed from the Tri-2SA N-glycans
corresponded to Tri-2SA(3,3), Tri-2SA(3,6), and Tri-2SA(6,6) in the
order of the shortest to longest retention time (Figure S-1, Supporting Information). The 4 isomeric structures
detected from the Tri-3SA N-glycan corresponded to Tri-3SA(3,3,3),
Tri-3SA(3,3,6), Tri-3SA(3,6,6), and Tri-3SA(6,6,6) (Figure S-2, Supporting Information). The Tri-4SA N-glycans
have more SAs than their antenna, and the fourth SA has been found
to be attached to the nonreducing end GlcNAc through α2-6 linkage.20 The exoglycosidase digestions revealed that
the SA linkage sites for glycans eluting in these peaks were Tri-4SA(3,3,3,6),
Tri-4SA(3,3,6,6), and Tri-4SA(3,6,6,6) (Figure S-3, Supporting Information), where the italicized numbers indicate
the linkage of the SA not attached to the terminal Gal residue. These
experiments clearly demonstrate that the glycans are being resolved
based on the ratio of their SA α2-3-to-α2-6 linkages.

1222.1) from analysis of the fetuin N-glycans. LC-SRM analysis illustrates
(B) the disappearance of the blue peak (Bi-2SA) and the appearance
of the pink peak (Bi-0SA) after Sialidase S digestion for the first
fraction; (C) the disappearance of the blue peak (Bi-2SA) and the
appearance of the brown peak (Bi-SA) after Sialidase digestion for
the second fraction; and (D) no change of the blue peak (Bi-2SA) after
Sialidase S digestion for the third fraction. Panels B–D contain
SRM traces for all three possible glycans resulting from this treatment,
i.e., the Bi-0SA, Bi-SA, and Bi-2SA; however, the low levels make
these difficult to see in all of the panels.

It is worth noting that there is a minor peak observed in
the LC-SRM
traces after the sialidase S digestion that corresponds to incomplete
SA release. For example, Figure 2B contains
a dominant peak corresponding to the biantennary structure with no
SAs (Bi-0SA with a pink trace), and a minor peak corresponding to
the biantennary structure with one SA (Bi-SA with a brown trace).
An explanation is that these minor peaks result from the incomplete
SA release. We feel that a more likely explanation is that minor amounts
of the other linkage isomers are present in the collected fractions.
For instance, the fraction containing the earliest eluting Bi-2SA
is dominated by the Bi-2SA(3,3) but a small amount of Bi-2SA(3,6)
was copurified in this sample. Similar discussions can be made for
the analysis of the other fraction after sialidase S digestion, shown
in Figures 2 and S1–S3 (Supporting Information). This rational leads
us to infer that the sialidase S digestion of the SA with α2-3
linkage can be completed under the described experiment conditions,
and that this treatment does not release detectable amounts of 2-6
linked SA.

A conclusion from these results is that the substitution
of an
α2-3 linked SA with an α2-6 linked SA on biantennary glycans
(Bi-SA and Bi-2SA) increases the retention time by a constant value,
in this case, approximately 1.4 min. The shift in retention time with
such substitution for triantennary glycans (Tri-2SA, Tri-3SA, and
Tri-4SA) is about 1.1 min under the described experimental conditions.
It is possible that the shift in glycan retention by the isomeric
substitution is altered by the overall retention of the glycan, which
is determined by the overall size of the glycan (number of sugar units).

Even with the ability to resolve α2-3/α2-6 linkage
isomers, many of these fractions likely contain multiple glycoforms.
For instance, there are two branching isomers that correspond to the
composition Bi-2SA(3,6) found in the second LC fraction. One of these
has the α2-6 linked SA on the antennae originating on the 6
branch of the core pentasaccharide, whereas the other has the α2-6
linked SA on the antennae originating on the 3 branch (Figure S-4A, Supporting Information). Because both of these
structures have been reported attached to fetuin, it does not appear
that the chromatographic conditions here are capable of resolving
these two branching isomers. Analogous discussions can be made concerning
the three possible Tri-2SA(3,3) branching isoforms (Figure S-4B, Supporting Information). Many of the other compositions
have the potential to have multiple branching isomers, in particular,
the compositions indicated by Tri-2SA(3,6), Tri-2SA(6,6), Tri-3SA(3,3,6),
Tri-3SA(3,6,6), and all 3 of the Tri-4SA combinations, which if present,
are not resolved with these conditions. The triantennary structures
of fetuin are also known to have Gal β1-3/Gal β1-4 linkage
isomers.20,32 The chromatographic conditions in the current
study do not appear to resolve these linkage isomers. Further study
will be required to define conditions that may allow resolution of
these additional linkage isomers either. Despite these limitations,
the ability to resolve glycans based on their SA α2-3/α2-6
linkages offers the potential to quickly isolate/quantitate these
linkage isomers. This capacity is expected to advance biomedical research
as it will facilitate the study of disease conditions wherein the
ratio of α2-3 to α2-6 SA linkages is expected to change.

UV and SRM Quantitation of Isomeric N-Glycans with Different
SA Linkages from Fetuin
The ProA tag of N-glycans added through
reductive amination chemistry gives nonselective labeling on the reducing
end in a 1:1 ratio, which makes it possible to achieve quantitation
by UV absorbance or fluorescence detection. However, the UV/fluorescence
quantitation requires that all the peaks are resolved from each other
in order to obtain individual peak area measurements, which can be
challenging with complex glycomic samples. Alternatively, SRM has
been widely employed for quantitative purposes, due to its excellent
selectivity, sensitivity, and ability to quantitate individual components
in complex mixtures. However, with the SRM approach, each glycan may
have a different response because of changes in parameters such as
the precursor charge states/adducts, ionization/fragmentation efficiencies,
etc. For example, in positive ion mode, the ionization efficiency
may decrease with increasing number of SA residues. In the fetuin
sample, the 3 isomers of Bi-2SA, 3 isomers of Tri-2SA, 4 isomers of
Tri-3SA, and 3 isomers of Tri-4SA were well-resolved from other detectable
glycans. Thus, the relative ratio of each structure could be obtained
without bias from UV detection, which enabled the exploration of the
SRM detection response for each of these glycans. In this study, the
most abundant ions for these derivatized N-glycans were the doubly
and triply protonated species. The most abundant molecular ion in
MS 1 for each composition was selected as the precursor for SRM quantitation,
as shown in Table S-1 (Supporting Information).

The relative quantity of each resolvable species was calculated
by dividing the peak area, obtained either by UV or SRM detection,
obtained for each glycan, with the sum of the peak areas from all
identifiable glycans. The standard deviations from triplicate measurements
were less that 1% for the results using UV and SRM detection, indicating
the high reproducibility of both detection methods. However, the relative
quantities obtained by UV detection are different from those obtained
by SRM (Figure 3). For example, the relative
quantity of Bi-2SA(3,6) was 7.8% with UV detection, whereas it was
14.5% by SRM detection. Conversely, the relative ratio of Tri-3SA(3,3,6)
was 34.5% by UV detection but only 26.2% by SRM detection. In general,
the relative quantities of Bi-2SA and Tri-2SA by SRM detection would
result in overestimation of the amounts, and the relative ratios of
Tri-3SA and Tri-4SA would be underestimated. In order to determine
whether the measurement differences between the UV and MRM detection
were significant, standard t-tests were performed.
For those 13 individual glycans, 11 glycans were found at p < 0.001 (Table S-3, Supporting
Information). The results indicated that there were statistically
significant differences between the UV and SRM detection for the relative
quantitation of individual structure across different glycan compositions.
The values obtained from UV detection were assumed to be correct because
(1) UV detection should not be affected by glycan structure/composition
and (2) MS analysis of each chromatographic peak demonstrated that
each contained a single glycan species. A possible explanation is
that the MS response in positive ion mode decreases with the addition
of negatively charged SA residues. Increased SA residues may also
lead to a shift in the charge state distribution of the glycans and
thus a decrease in the observed response when comparing the SRM signal
at a selected charge state for glycans with differing SA compositions.
Another explanation is that the SRM response decreases with increasing
MW of the glycan, which could result from decreased ionization efficiency,
ion transmission, and/or fragmentation efficiency. Yet another possibility
is that the organic/aqueous composition of the chromatographic solvent
changes during the gradient elution, and that ionization efficiency
is dependent on the composition at elution for each component. Of
course, there are multiple other explanations, all of which may be
correct, but the important point is simply that the SRM response changes
with the composition of the glycan.

Figure 3 Relative quantitation of the major glycan
linkage isomers of fetuin
by UV and LC-SRM detection. The response for each glycoform is relative
to the summed response for all identified glycans.

The SRM responses for isomeric glycans were then
evaluated by comparing
the relative quantitation of isomeric structures for glycans of a
given composition. For instance, the relative ratios of each Bi-2SA
isomer were calculated from the total amount of all the 3 isomers
for both UV absorbance and SRM detection, and so forth. Comparisons
of the relative responses for each of the glycan to the other glycans
having the same compositions demonstrate that the relative quantitation
obtained by SRM detection are in very good agreement with those obtained
by UV detection (Figure 4), which suggests
that there are negligible differences in the SRM responses for linkage
isomers. The t-tests were again used to determine
the significance of these differences and various levels of significance
were tested. With the same 13 glycans, only 2 glycans were found at p < 0.05 and none of them was found at p < 0.001 (Table S-3, Supporting Information). Hence, reliable relative quantitation of individual isomers can
be achieved by comparing the SRM responses to other N-glycans with
the same composition.

to the summed response for all glycoforms with the same composition.

SRM Quantitation of SA
Linkage Isomers from Human Serum
Human serum has received
considerable attention in the glycomic field
as a rich source of structurally and functionally diverse glycoproteins,33−37 which are potential biomarkers for numerous conditions. The released
glycan pool from human serum contains over 120 different N-glycan
structures;38 consequently, many glycans
coelute. For instance, the Q1MS full scan showed that the Bi-SA glycan
(m/z at 1076.5) and the Man-9 glycan
(m/z at 1052.0, which represents
the glycan composition of Man9GlcNAc2) are coeluting at a retention
time of 30.5 min with the LC conditions used in this study (Figure 5). However, due to the difference of their molecular
weights, these two glycans produce two different SRM traces, enabling
quantitation of both species. The use of MS detection also adds a
level of confidence in the identity of the species being quantitated,
as well as indicating peaks that result from overlapping glycans,
where the quantitative results will be suspect. For the human serum
sample, identity of the SA linkage isomers was determined based on
a combination of mass and retention time. The relative quantity of
the individual glycan isomers was calculated relative to the SRM response
for glycans with the same composition, as shown in Table 1. The ability to chromatographically resolve SA
linkage isomers coupled with SRM detection permits the identification
and relative quantitation of N-glycan SA α2-3/2-6 linkage isomers.

Figure 5 (A) UV
Chromatogram for detection of ProA-labeled N-glycans from
human serum; (B) MS spectrum for the selected peak (indicated by the
star), showing the coelution of several different glycans. Man9 corresponds
to the high mannose glycan with a composition of Man9GlcNAc2.

Conclusions
A
novel hydroxylated Fused-Core silica material has high utility
for HILIC separation of reducing terminus labeled N-linked glycans.
With the developed method, baseline separation was achieved for N-glycan
isomers with α2-3/2-6 SA linkages, which facilitated the structure
identification and quantitation of each isomer via LC-SRM analysis.
The current method has been used for relative quantitation of SA linkage
isomers of individual glycoproteins, and for N-glycans from human
serum. Resolution and quantitation of these glycans may assist in
early diagnosis of certain pathologies, based on previous observations
of altered α2-3 and α2-6 SA linkage quantities.
