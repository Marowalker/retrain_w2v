Evidence
will be presented that in the article “Novel LC–MS2 Product Dependent Parallel Data Acquisition Function and
Data Analysis Workflow for Sequencing and Identification of Intact
Glycopeptides” written by Wu, S.-W.; Pu, T.-H.; Viner, R.; Khoo, K.-H. in Anal. Chem. 2014 86 , 5478 –5486 24796651 , noncovalent homo- and heterodimers were
mis-identified as glycopeptides bearing well-defined N-linked structures,
where the unexplained mass was attributed to excessive O-glycosylation.
Noncovalent dimer formation of abundant components has not previously
been considered as a complication in high-throughput proteomic analyses.

My observations
are based on
information presented in the article “Novel LC–MS2 Product Dependent Parallel Data Acquisition Function and
Data Analysis Workflow for Sequencing and Identification of Intact
Glycopeptides” written by Wu, S.-W.; Pu, T.-H.; Viner, R.; Khoo, K.-H. in Anal. Chem. 2014 86 , 5478 –5486 24796651  and the raw data associated with it.

Wu et al. beautifully presented that the different MS/MS activation
methods, ion trap collision induced dissociation (CID), beam-type
CID (higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD)), and electron transfer
dissociation (ETD), deliver different information about the glycopeptide
structure, underscoring the necessity of using these data combined.
They also demonstrated the utility of “Sweet Heart for HCD”,
a software developed by them for N-linked glycopeptide analysis. This
software heavily relies on the identification of a characteristic/diagnostic
N-glycopeptide fragment, Y1, i.e., the intact peptide retaining the
innermost GlcNAc. They illustrated the diagnostic value of this fragment
in N-linked glycopeptide identification by comparing data interpretation
delivered by Sweet Heart and Byonic, a commercially available search
engine that is marketed for glycosylation analysis (ProteinMetrics/Thermo).
The data analyzed derived from a tryptic digest of recombinant human
soluble EGF-receptor and were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid
mass spectrometer. In the original publication, Tables S1-1 and 1-2
in the Supporting Information (fully and partially reproduced as Figures
S1 and S11 in the Supporting Information, respectively) sum up the cases where Byonic was obviously wrong,
since the Y1 fragment detected contradicted the peptide assignment.
These tables themselves are excellent illustrations of some of the
issues proteomic studies have to deal with constantly. Quite a few
of the mis-assignments might be the results of faulty peak-picking,
i.e., of incorrect monoisotopic ion assignments. Unfortunately, this
is a recurring issue with high mass, high charge-state, and low intensity
ions that are more common for large mass glycopeptides than unmodified
sequences. Byonic now has its own peak-picking feature that eliminates
most of these problems. However, overlapping ion clusters and missing
monoisotopic peaks (see Table 1 and precursor
ion profiles in Figures S2, S4, S8, S13, S17, and S20 in the Supporting Information versus calculated values
in Figures S3, S7, S10, S14, S18, and S21 in the Supporting Information) still may prevent the accurate determination
of the molecular mass. However, the Y1 fragment and carbohydrate fragmentation
data together may deliver the correct assignment, i.e., the “Sweet
Heart for HCD” approach could succeed.

represents automated deconvolution values using Xtract, a feature
of Thermo’s Xcalibur software. The correct value determined
for the Man6 and Man7 dimer indicates that it
can compensate for the missing monoisotopic peak.

due to thresholding in data acquisition.

There are examples for metal- and ammonia-adduct formation
and
covalent modifications. Such fortuitous modifications during sample
preparation/analysis are the downfall of automated data interpretation.
Search engines cannot overwrite the search parameters even when it
is blatantly obvious for the human observer that something unexpected
happened. For example, in this glycosylation study CID fragmentation
indicated that mannose residues were randomly partially formylated
(+28 Da) (Figure S2 in the original paper) or acetylated (+42 Da).
Whenever glycans are covalently modified or form noncovalent adducts,
even if the nature of the modification cannot be deciphered, the same
Y1 fragment shows that spectra are from glycoforms of the same peptide,
and this was indeed correctly presented in the article.

The
more interesting cases are those mis-identifications when,
after correcting for the mass of the peptide sequence based on the
Y1 fragment detected, the authors could not account for 1500–3500
Da mass differences (see the list in Figures S1 and S11 in the Supporting Information). The authors concluded
the HCD and CID data of m/z 1344.6(5+)
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) represent the peptide NCTSISGDLHILPVAFR bearing GlcNAc2Man7 at Asn-1, and an O-linked structure is responsible
for the 3278 Da mass that is “missing”. This is a very
unlikely explanation. There are only three potential O-glycosylation
sites in this peptide. If all these sites were occupied with a SAGalGalNAc
structure (one of the most common mammalian O-linked carbohydrates),
whose presence is suggested in the CID spectrum by the m/z 657 ion (Figure S2/C in the Supporting Information), this would only account for 1968
Da. There are no fragments indicating larger O-linked structures.
Furthermore, there is no sign of sialic acid in the HCD spectrum (Figure
S2B in the Supporting Information): its
abundant oxonium ions should be seen at m/z 274 and 292; and the ion trap CID spectrum (Figure S2C
in the Supporting Information; Figure 1B) does not look typical either.
In the CID spectrum one would expect to see an ion series of somewhat
even abundance corresponding to the loss of terminal sugars or multiunit
parts of an antennae as well as a dominant Y1 fragment, just like
in Figure 1A. However, the CID spectrum (Figure
S2C in the Supporting Information and Figure 1B) is dominated by two species: the NCTSISGDLHILPVAFR
peptide bearing GlcNAc2Man6 and GlcNAc2Man7 structures, abundant 2+ and 3+ ions were detected
for both. This observation gave me the idea that the precursor ion
picked for the MS/MS analysis must have been the (5+) heterodimer
formed from these glycoforms, i.e., [(M(Man6)M(Man7)H5]5+

Figure 1 Panel A shows the CID data of the NC(Carbamidomethyl)TSISGDLHILPVAFR
peptide modified at Asn-1 with a GlcNAc2Man7 structure, precursor at m/z 1147.5(3+).
Oxonium ions are indicated with their sugar compositions, while ‘Y’
fragments are labeled with the sugar losses. Obviously the identity
of the sugar units cannot be determined from these data, so the assignments
are based on common knowledge of mammalian N-linked glycosylation.
Panel B displays the CID of m/z 1344.6(5+).
These data suggest that a noncovalent heterodimer of the Man6 and Man7 glycoforms was fragmented. Both spectra were
acquired in the linear ion trap so are low resolution and low mass
accuracy data.

Figure 2 MS survey scan from which
the precursor ion for the CID spectrum
in Figure 1B was selected. The inset shows
the precursor ion cluster. Table 1 lists the
different glycoforms present in this spectrum.

The authors kindly shared the raw data with me. After a thorough
investigation, I am convinced that all those precursor ions that were
reported with the corrected amino acid sequence shortened to NCTSISGDLHILPVAFR,
but with a large “mass defect”, represent noncovalent
dimers formed in the gas-phase in the mass spectrometer. In addition
to the example discussed above, CID and MS data of five additional
noncovalent dimers are presented in the Supporting
Information (Figures S4, S8, S12, S16, and S19). The most convincing
proof for the existence of heterodimers is shown in Figure S15 in
the Supporting Information, which is the
HCD spectrum of a glycopeptide and an unrelated peptide heterodimer.
Peptide fragments unambiguously confirm the presence of both components. Wu et al. correctly identified the Y1 fragment and,
thus, the glycosylated sequence in this “compound” (as
well as for all the other noncovalent assemblies). Nevertheless, Sweet
Heart could not deliver the correct interpretation.

Noncovalent
gas-phase cluster formation is a known phenomenon.
Studies on the fragmentation mechanism of peptide clusters1 or their utilization for controlled peptide bond
formation2 have been reported. Similarly,
nonspecific noncovalent gas-phase interaction between peptides and
oligosaccharides has been described.3 More
than 20 years ago we reported that abundant analytes could be detected
in the high energy CID spectra of any “background” precursor
ion, probably due to nonspecific cluster formation between the analytes
and the liquid “matrix”.4 With this said, I am not aware of any publication when noncovalent
dimerization has been considered in the context of high-throughput
proteomic experiments. One cannot exclude the possibility that noncovalent
homo- and heterodimers are formed during nLC–MS experiments
from the more abundant components of a complex mixture of high dynamic
range (almost all “real life” samples qualify), and
such noncovalent dimers may “dwarf” the minor components.
Ions representing such dimers may be selected for MS/MS analysis,
and there is a good chance for mis-interpretation. This danger is
obviously enhanced whenever a study is aimed at the characterization
of relatively “rare” large molecules, i.e., whenever
precursors of high m/z value, high
charge state, and relatively low abundance are targeted for MS/MS
analysis. Such experiments would include studies of cross-linked peptides
from protein complexes or as in the present example, intact glycopeptide
analysis. It is not known how frequently this might occur and thus
how much of a problem this might represent for automated data interpretation.
I cannot help but wonder how many times this might have resulted in
reporting incorrect structural assignments already.
