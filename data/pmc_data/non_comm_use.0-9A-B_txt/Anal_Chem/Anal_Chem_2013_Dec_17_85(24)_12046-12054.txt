The accurate measurement of metabolite
concentrations in miniscule
biological sample volumes is often desirable, yet it remains challenging.
In many cases, the starting analyte volumes are imprecisely known,
or not directly measurable, and hence absolute metabolite concentrations
are difficult to calculate. Here, we introduce volume determination
using two standards (VDTS) as a general quantitative method for the
analysis of polar metabolites in submicrolitre samples using 1H NMR spectroscopy. This approach permits the back calculation
of absolute metabolite concentrations from small biological samples
of unknown volume. Where small sample volumes are also variable, VDTS
can improve multivariate chemometric analysis. In this context, principal
component analysis (PCA) yielded more logically consistent and biologically
insightful outputs when we used volume-corrected spectra, calculated
using VDTS, rather than probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN)
of raw spectra. As proof-of-principle, the VDTS-based method and PCA
were used to analyze polar metabolites in the hemolymph (blood) extracted
from larvae of the very small but widely used genetic model organism Drosophila. This analysis showed that the hemolymph metabolomes
of males and females are markedly different when larvae are well fed.
However, gender-specific metabolomes tend to converge when larval
dietary nutrients are restricted. We discuss the biological implications
of these surprising results and compare and contrast them to previous
analyses of Drosophila hemolymph and mammalian blood
plasma. Together, these findings reveal an interesting and hitherto
unknown sexual dimorphism in systemic Drosophila metabolites,
clearly warranting further biological investigation. Importantly,
the VDTS approach should be adaptable to many different analytical
platforms, including mass spectrometry.

==== Body
Metabolomic profiling, either
by mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
is increasingly being used to provide new insights into fundamental
biological processes in a multitude of different species. With known
sample volumes of relatively abundant material, the absolute quantification
of metabolite concentration is, in principle, straightforward by measurement
of peak intensities after normalization for environmental variation
or instrumental instability. For example, in many applications of
metabolomics to human body fluids such as urine, plasma or cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), the volume of the starting sample can be accurately measured.
Thus the absolute concentration of each metabolite is accessible by
reference to a single internal standard and by accounting for dilution
during sample preparation. However, many tissue biopsies and rarer
human fluids such as endolymph are only available in limiting and
variable amounts of unknown sample volume. Such “difficult”
small samples not only have the potential to compromise measurement
sensitivity, but their variability challenges many data normalization
methods. Where imprecisely known small samples require dilution to provide a sample of sufficient volume for the analytical
measurement, the extent to which metabolites are diluted (the sample-specific
‘dilution factor’) is either not known or inaccurately
determined. As a result, although measurement of the metabolite concentrations
in the diluted sample is straightforward, back-calculation
of the absolute concentrations in the starting material is inherently
compromised. To avoid these difficulties, many studies resort to the
measurement of relative changes, rather than absolute concentrations
of the metabolites, using the methods of chemometric multivariate
analysis. Here issues related to absolute metabolite concentration
are taken care of by “statistical normalization”. In
many instances the method of choice is probabilistic quotient normalization
(PQN),1 which outperforms a number of other
means of normalization (e.g., integral normalization and vector length
normalization). PQN accounts for specific and unspecific variation
in a set of measurements, corresponding to changes in a minority subset
of spectral features and the total spectral intensity, respectively.
However its successful application is limited by the requirement that
relative concentrations of the profiled metabolites (or more strictly
the intensities of the corresponding spectral features) do not vary
by more than ∼50%.1

The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has become
an increasingly powerful genetic model for the study of metabolism
during growth, development and aging.2−4 However, the very small
size of the organism has been a hindrance for the accurate measurement
of metabolite concentrations in individual tissues or within the circulating
body fluid, known as hemolymph. As part of ongoing investigations
into the roles of dietary nutrients during the growth of Drosophila, we have monitored changes in polar hemolymph metabolites upon nutrient
restriction (NR) during larval development.5 The inherent small size of the organism, the fully grown larva is
∼1 × 0.5 mm (length × width), equates to hemolymph
sample volumes that are of the order of only a few hundred nanoliters.
This, together with their high viscosity, makes it difficult to measure
hemolymph volumes accurately using a direct method. Moreover, in comparing
different strains of the organism, or the response of a single strain
to different growth conditions, it is difficult to assess whether
or not the recovered hemolymph volumes might vary in any systematic
way.

1H NMR spectroscopy can be used to provide a
relatively
unbiased approach to metabolomics investigation.6−17 Here, we describe the development of methods for the application 1H NMR to the analysis of polar metabolites in small and variable
samples of unknown starting volume. We select Drosophila larval hemolymph as a challenging test case and introduce the method
of volume determination using two standards (VDTS) to assess accurately
the sample dilution and original analyte volume. We report the concentrations
of the most abundant polar hemolymph metabolites and provide a comparative
analysis of the hemolymph metabolome under fed and nutrient restriction
(NR) conditions in both male and female larvae. Application of VDTS
combined with supervised fitting of the NMR spectra obtained for four
different conditions (male vs female, fed vs NR) allows a quantitative
assessment of each metabolite concentration, revealing previously
unreported gender-specific variation of the hemolymph metabolome under
fed conditions that is suppressed under NR. Moreover, it is demonstrated
that standard application of PQN analysis to the raw data without
correction for the sample-to-sample dilution factor fails to provide
a physically self-consistent set of peak intensities in the loadings
plot. However, by using VDTS to facilitate normalizing the data set
with respect to absolute concentration, the PCA output is rendered
sensible. This approach allows for the facile determination of the
sample-to-sample variance and, via analysis of the corresponding loadings
plots, the identification of molecular species contributing to that
variance. The principle of VDTS is thus demonstrated to be a valuable
tool in metabolomics analysis of small and variable sample volumes,
and is likely to be of general utility in measurement paradigms other
than NMR spectroscopy.

Experimental Section
Larvae of a Drosophila melanogaster isogenic strain
(w1118 iso 31)18 were transferred to standard
yeast/cornmeal/agar food within 1 h of hatching and raised at 25 °C
for 68 h until mid-L3 (larval wet weight ∼1.3 mg). Larvae were
then floated from the food with 30% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and transferred to control diet (standard yeast/cornmeal/agar
food) or a nutrient restriction medium (0.5% agarose in PBS) for a
further 20 h at 25 °C.

For hemolymph isolation in batch
mode, larvae were floated in 30%
glycerol/PBS and rinsed in water, and groups of 10 (fed condition)
or 15 (NR condition) larvae were blotted dry on tissue paper and placed
on Parafilm. Using a Hamilton syringe to ensure accuracy, a 20 μL
drop of ice cold saline with 100 μM sodium 13C-formate
was placed on the group of larvae, and sharp forceps were used to
tear the cuticle of each larva, releasing the hemolymph into the droplet,
but without damaging any internal tissues. All larvae were opened
within 2 min, and 17.5 μL of the saline/sodium formate/hemolymph
solution was then removed with the Hamilton syringe and added to 200
μL reverse-osmosis deionized water containing 80 μM sodium
4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate (DSS), and any cells, such
as hemocytes, present in the hemolymph were removed by centrifugation
(2 min at 13 krpm, Millipore UFC30GV0S 0.22 μm filter). To control
for nonspecific interaction of the sodium formate with the larval
cuticle, another group of larvae were treated as described but were
not opened in the droplet and, therefore, did not release hemolymph.
To control for evaporation of the drop during the sampling procedure,
a 20 μL drop (no larvae) was placed on the Parafilm, left for
2 min, and 17.5 μL was removed and treated as described.

A similar procedure was used to prepare hemolymph extracts starting
from individual larvae: the volume of the saline/sodium 13C-formate drop was reduced to 3 μL, and after opening the larva,
2.5 μL was removed and added to 200 μL water containing
8 μM DSS before centrifugation.

Methanol–chloroform
metabolite extraction was performed
using the method of Bligh and Dyer.19 Briefly,
the aqueous sample was mixed with 750 μL 2:1 methanol-chloroform
by vortexing. Phase separation was accomplished by the addition of
250 μL chloroform followed by 250 μL H2O. The
upper (aqueous) layer was evaporated to dryness (Savant DNA 120 centrifugal
evaporator), resuspended in 160 μL 99.9% D2O and
transferred to a 3 mm NMR tube (Bruker Biospin).

NMR spectra
were acquired with a Bruker Avance II instrument with
a nominal 1H frequency of 700 MHz using a CPTCI cryoprobe.
The Bruker pulse program noesygppr1d was used with
a 1 s presaturation pulse (50 Hz bandwidth) centered on the water
resonance, 0.1 ms mixing time, and 4 s acquisition time at 25 °C.
For chemometric analysis the data sets were zero-filled, Fourier-transformed
and phase corrected in NMRLab.20 Spectra were then transferred to Metabolab,20 and baseline correction was applied
using common control points. Analyte peaks were aligned using Icoshift(21) and signals for background
and internal controls were excluded. The spectra were normalized using
PQN,1 mean-centered and variance-stabilized
using Pareto scaling.22 PCA analyses were
carried out using PLS Toolbox (Eigenvector Research
Inc.).

The metabolite concentrations were measured using the Chenomx
NMR Suite (Chenomx Inc.) according to the software’s
standard procedures. Briefly, the data sets were zero-filled, Fourier-transformed,
phased and baseline-corrected in Chenomx NMR Processor. The chemical shape indicator was fitted to the DSS trimethylsilyl
resonance and the spectra were transferred to Chenomx NMR
Profiler. The library spectra were fitted in semiautomated
fashion to the experimental data, yielding a read-out of the metabolite
concentration relative to that of the known DSS standard.

The
measurement uncertainties given in Table 1 were
calculated using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
and significance was determined using the Tukey “honestly significant
difference” (HSD) test.

With the
design of the VDTS procedure in which identical volumes
of standard 13C-formate and DSS solutions are used for
both real and control measurements, it can be shown (see Supporting Information) that the degree of dilution
of the hemolymph into the 13C-formate droplet can be written
as 1  where Vh is the
volume of hemolymph sample released from the larvae, Vf is the (starting) volume of 13C-formate solution
in which the larvae are opened, and Ic′f/I′f corresponds
to the ratio of the 13C-formate 1H NMR peak
intensities in the control (c) and real experiments
and the primes indicate that each of the two spectra has been normalized
to the DSS methyl group resonance. Knowledge of the dilution factor
allows for extraction of the absolute concentration of metabolite X in the starting hemolymph according to (see Supporting Information): 2  where [f]0 is
the concentration of 13C-formate used in the droplet and IX/If is the ratio
of 1H NMR resonance intensities measured for metabolite
X and 13C-formate, normalized to the number of protons
contributing to the measured peak heights/areas (e.g., for each of
the two 13C-satellites of the 13C-formate resonance
this is 0.5 protons, for a nondegenerate methyl group resonance the
corresponding value is three protons).

Results
Obtaining NMR
Spectra of Larval Hemolymph
Hemolymph
was obtained by rupturing the cuticle of larvae in a droplet of saline
of known volume. Clarified hemolymph was either diluted into D2O containing reference standard DSS at fixed concentration
(unextracted) or extracted for the polar components into an aqueous
phase by a method that separates soluble metabolites from proteins
and lipids,19 followed by dilution into
D2O containing DSS (extracted). Consistent with other contexts,
this extraction procedure was observed to recover >95% of the metabolites
detectable in the unextracted data and quenches further chemical change.
Despite the small amount of starting material, NMR spectroscopy of
diluted hemolymph extracts from single larvae yielded data with reasonable
S/N using signal averaging over a period of a few hours. High quality
spectra could be obtained more quickly for batches of larvae, extracted
into a single droplet sample. Figure 1 shows
the 700 MHz 1H NMR spectra of the extracted hemolymph polar
metabolome for batches of fed (n = 10) and NR (n = 15) late L3 larvae using an overall data acquisition
time of ∼40 min. When normalized on a per-animal basis, the
total metabolite signal intensity for the fed animals is significantly
greater than that for the NR animals, presumably reflecting the lower
body mass5 in the latter cohort. By reference
to databases of known metabolite NMR spectra, we identified the components
present in each spectrum accounting for the vast majority (>90%)
of
the observed signals. Of note, a major component in the larval spectra
corresponds to O-phosphotyrosine, easily distinguishable by the pair
of doublet resonances in the aromatic region of the spectrum (δ
= 7.17, 7.22 ppm). This metabolite is absent from all metabolite databases
examined to date but, in Drosophila, it is known
to be involved in sclerotization of the larval cuticle.23−25 Consistent with this assignment, we did not find O-phosphotyrosine
in the hemolymph metabolome of adult flies (data not shown). Another
major component of the spectra corresponds to the disaccharide trehalose,
α-d-Glu-(1→1)-α-d-Glu. Interestingly
the contribution to the spectrum from glucose itself is extremely
small, more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than for trehalose. This
observation indicates that trehalose is the primary circulating form
of sugar in larval hemolymph.

Absolute Metabolite Concentration by VDTS
Our aim was
to characterize the impact of NR on the larval hemolymph metabolome
in a quantitative manner. Obtaining the absolute metabolite concentrations
requires normalization of the fed vs NR data on the basis of the extracted
hemolymph volume. We obtained the extraction volume by indirect means,
as described in schematic form in Figure 2.
We denote this procedure as “volume determination using two
standards” or VDTS. The larvae were ruptured in a precisely
dispensed volume of saline containing a known concentration of 13C-labeled sodium formate. A precisely measured portion of
the clarified solution was diluted into water containing 80 μM
DSS and submitted to chloroform–methanol extraction. The polar
fraction was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in D2O. The sample for analysis therefore contains both DSS and 13C-formate as features that aid data set normalization (see Experimental Section). The DSS concentration is
essentially constant for each sample, and the presence of the DSS
methyl group resonance allows for both chemical shift referencing
and normalization for any measurement variance arising from, for example,
pipetting precision or variation in NMR probe sensitivity due to salt
effects. The presence of the well-resolved 13C-formate
H-1 signal (doublet centered at δ = 8.44 ppm, 1JCH = 194.6 Hz) allows for the accurate and precise
determination of the volume of hemolymph released into the droplet
by comparison of the signal intensity to that obtained for a control
droplet into which the same number of larvae have been introduced
but not ruptured. Knowledge of the hemolymph starting volume allows
for the derivation of the absolute concentration of the metabolites
(in the hemolymph) from their NMR signal intensities
normalized to the DSS standard (see Supporting
Information).

sampling strategy. A number (n) of larvae are either
opened or unopened (control) in an accurately measured volume vf of buffer containing 13C-formate at a known concentration [f]0. After centrifugal filtering to remove hemocytes (a), an
accurately measured volume (vt) of the
diluted hemolymph is transferred to a known volume (vD) of chloroform/methanol/water (green) containing a fixed
concentration of DSS (b) in a glass vial. After addition of further
extraction reactions (see Experimental Section), vortexing and centrifugation, the aqueous layer is aspirated to
a microfuge tube (d). The solution is evaporated to dryness (e) and
the residue suspended in D2O (f) prior to transfer to an
NMR tube (g). [X]h: Concentration of metabolite X in neat hemolymph. vh: Volume of hemolymph recovered.

Using the VDTS method, we found that hemolymph volumes from
L3
larvae ranged over 692 ± 75 nL for fed females and 406 ±
34 nL for fed males, 234 ± 57 nL for NR males and 227 ±
64 nL for NR females. Using a database of metabolite NMR spectra (Chenomx
Inc., supplemented with the spectrum for O-phosphotyrosine), which
were collected with identical acquisition parameters,6 we determined the absolute concentrations of 29 molecular
components in the fed and NR data sets from male and female larvae.
This procedure required highly supervised semiautomated fitting of
the library with the experimental data. Table 1 lists the experimentally determined metabolite concentrations, calculated
from triplicate samples in each of two completely independent fed
vs. NR experiments. The reliably quantified metabolite concentrations
range from ∼70 mM down to ∼0.05 mM. In addition, we
could establish that a small number of other metabolites, that possess
characteristic spectral features and are commonly detected in other
systems, were definitively not detected in the hemolymph spectra.
These include carnitine, cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, ornithine,
and serine (see Table 1 for estimated limits
of detection for these compounds). Within Table 1 bold figures indicate statistically significant differences between males and females for either the fed or NR conditions.
The data in Table 1 demonstrate that, in fed
larvae, the concentration of the majority of the quantifiable metabolites
is significantly higher in male larvae than in females; a notable
exception is glutamine. Under NR, the metabolite levels fall in both
genders and the sex-dependent differences are greatly reduced (see Supporting Information Figure 1). However, the
concentrations of two metabolites (betaine and phosphocholine) are
elevated in both male and female NR larvae relative to the fed condition.
For certain metabolites (e.g., malate) the levels are not detectably
dependent upon gender or feeding status.

Impact of VDTS on Chemometric
Analysis
The laborious
nature of the fitting procedure used to obtain the absolute biological
concentrations of all metabolites listed in Table 1 makes it unattractive to extend this approach to larger data
sets (e.g., increased numbers of larvae; more dietary conditions;
more developmental stages). Instead, it would be preferable to apply
exploratory data analysis methods such as PCA to obtain similar insights
into the differences between sample classes at a lesser time cost.
However, the commonly applied preprocessing normalization procedures
required for this approach such as PQN1 implicitly assume that experimental manipulations (here fed vs NR,
male vs female larvae) lead to small effects relative to the overall
signal mass.

Figures 3 and 4 comprise the output of PQN/PCA analysis of the fed versus
NR larval NMR data. The plots presented in Figures 3A and 4A were obtained by applying
the analysis to the raw spectra without volume correction; the plots
in Figure 3B and 4B
are for the corresponding analysis when the individual spectra have
been prescaled according to the dilution factors derived by measurement
of DSS and 13C-formate signal intensities using VDTS. In
both cases, the PCA output (scores plot; Figure 3) provides unambiguous discrimination of the fed and NR conditions
along principal component (PC) 1. In the absence of volume correction,
however, the loadings plot for PC1 possesses a negative, nonzero baseline
offset across the entire spectral width (Figure 4A). In addition, the loading for PC2 shows signals of opposite sign
for resonances from the same metabolite. This is most clearly demonstrated
for the well resolved signals derived from the anomeric proton of
trehalose at δ = 5.19 ppm. Figure 5 shows
that one of the natural abundance 13C-satellite peaks is
negative, while the main 12C-peak and other 13C-satellite signal are both positive. The first of these outcomes
indicates an intrinsic breakdown of the preprocessing procedure: nonzero
baselines in loadings from mean-centered data indicate that the normalization
step has failed. Therefore, without volume correction and under the
assumption that the hemolymph volume sampled for each measurement
is consistent, the loadings would be misinterpreted as the overall
signal strength being much higher in fed versus NR larvae, leading
to an overestimation of the differences between these conditions.
The second outcome is not logically self-consistent as the loadings
for different NMR signals for the same metabolite are not always “in-phase”
nor with intensities characteristic of the relative number of protons
in contributing to each multiplet. In addition, in the absence of
volume correction, PCA erroneously separates the two independent experiments
(via PC2) and fails to detect (via any of the first six PCs) the male
vs. female separation that was clearly demonstrated with absolute
metabolite concentrations (Table 1). In contrast,
when VDTS dilution correction is applied, the PC1 loadings have essentially
zero baseline offset, and all resonances for each metabolite exhibit
consistent positive or negative direction (Figures 4B, 5). Following VDTS, PC2 also correctly
provides discrimination between the males and females in the fed condition,
while also indicating overlap of males and females under NR. These
results show that accurate volume correction is required to obtain
a logically consistent and biologically meaningful output for the
multivariate analysis of the hemolymph metabolomics data set.

Discussion
Utility of VDTS in the
Metabolomics of Small Variable Sample
Volumes
This study provides an optimized method for the sampling,
quantitation and 1H NMR analysis of metabolites in small,
indeterminate and variable sample volumes. As a difficult test case,
we sampled hemolymph from Drosophila larvae raised
on well-fed vs. malnourished conditions. In this type of dietary manipulation,
and probably in many other contexts, it is not valid to make the assumption
that all samples yield comparable overall signal strength. Under these
conditions, analyte volume differences must be taken into account
after data acquisition in order to maximize the biological relevance
of multivariate chemometric analysis. The VDTS protocol introduced
in this study provides an accurate method for such volume corrections.
In VDTS, one standard is used to normalize the spectra for any variance
arising from measurement factors such as pipetting precision or variation
in intrinsic spectrometer sensitivity from sample-to-sample. A second
standard is then used to control for the degree of sample dilution
into the analysis droplet. The characteristics of an ideal internal
standard include that it should be chemically inert under the conditions
of the measurement, possess signal(s) dispersed from those of other
sample components, and not present in the biological samples. DSS
is an industry-standard NMR reference compound for aqueous solutions
that fulfills these requirements. The H-1 signal of formate satisfies
only the first two of these criteria. Our experience has been that
formate ions can be present, or adventitiously introduced, at detectable
levels in analyte samples. Therefore we adopted 13C-labeled-formate
as the second standard: the 1JCH coupling splits the signal into a well-resolved doublet that does
not overlap with any other metabolite that we have detected to date.

The VDTS protocol, combined with comparison of the NMR spectra
with a database of library NMR spectra, permitted the determination
of absolute concentrations of a large number of hemolymph polar metabolites
under several different experimental conditions (see Table 1). Moreover, knowledge of the dilution factor (Vh/Vf) obtained for
each sample using VDTS leads to a more biologically relevant PCA output
than when the standard PQN normalization approach is applied to the
uncorrected raw data. The aberrant nature of the loadings in the absence
of correction for dilution factors (see Figure 4) reflects the application of mean-centering to data sets that contain
high intensity signals with a high degree of variance, as is often
likely with small samples of indeterminate and variable volume. Importantly,
the experimental logic of the VDTS approach has the potential to be
employed in any context where the recovered analyte
sample volume is so small as to be indeterminate with a high degree
of precision. As we have demonstrated, application of the VDTS protocol
allows for a more sensible output of the PCA process for different
conditions, leading to a logically self-consistent loadings plot during
multivariate analysis of the data, and the reliable identification
of important features in the data.

Comparison of VDTS-NMR
with Other Polar Metabolomic Approaches
Used in Drosophila
Given the widespread
use of Drosophila as a model organism, and the relative
ease of dietary and tissue-specific genetic manipulation, there is
surprisingly little in the literature by way of comprehensive metabolomics
investigations in this species. This presumably reflects the practical
complexities associated with limited sample volumes. Nevertheless,
a small number of studies report targeted measurements of amino acids
and other compounds in hemolymph using hybrid liquid chromatography
(LC)-MS and capillary electrophoresis-laser induced fluorescence (CE-LIF)
procedures.26−32 In particular Shippy and co-workers have demonstrated a method to
detect and estimate the concentration of a subset of amino acids in
both larval and adult hemolymph of single animals, using chemical
derivatization and CE-LIF.26−28 Further discussion of issues
relating to metabolomics measurements in small volume samples is provided
in the Supporting Information.

In
many insect species, the nonreducing carbohydrate trehalose is the
major blood sugar.33 Interestingly, with
VDTS-NMR we detect only a very low level of circulating glucose (∼0.2
mM glucose vs ∼40 mM trehalose), which is in contrast to other
reports in the literature.34 While variations
in reported glucose concentrations may partially reflect changes in
diet or larval stages, postharvesting degradation of trehalose to
glucose in nonextracted hemolymph appears to be a major problem (see Supporting Information Figure 2). This is likely
due to the persistence of active trehalase enzyme in the hemolymph.35 However, when hemolymph is rapidly extracted
with methanol-chloroform, we find that the trehalose signal is stable
over time. The artifactual appearance of glucose in the hemolymph
has important implications for the interpretation of metabolic studies
in Drosophila, and we suggest that care should be
taken to suppress adventitious trehalose breakdown in future studies.
In a similar fashion, we also detected rapid diminution of the tyrosine
signals in unextracted hemolymph samples, which could be attributable
to an artifactual melanization reaction (see Supporting
Information Figure 2).

We could not detect glutamate
ions in our NMR spectra of hemolymph,
which contrasts with other reports suggesting a range of millimolar
concentrations for this amino acid.26,27,36,37 Some of these previous
studies27,28 used an extraction technique involving dried,
pinned larvae that were dissected on a microscope stage and the hemolymph
withdrawn via a capillary of large diameter (relative to the animal).
We reasoned that opening of the larva by cuticle rupture in a buffer
droplet is a more rapid method of hemolymph extraction that minimizes
the stress to the animals prior to extraction. We note that circulating
glutamate ions would probably need to be kept low in the hemolymph,
given that this molecule is a neurotransmitter at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.38 Interestingly
we were easily able to detect glutamate in whole larval extracts,
that is, when larvae were harvested by ball bearing homogenization
rather than careful tearing with forceps (data not shown). These observations
suggest that glutamate is compartmentalized in Drosophila tissues other than hemolymph. Using the CE-LIF method, the larval
hemolymph concentrations of other amino acids were also calculated
by Piyankarage et al.27 We note that the
degree to which the reported concentrations might correspond to our
measurements is difficult to assess since the developmental stage
in that study was not more precisely defined than “third instar”,
and the sex was not reported. Nevertheless, the overall profile of
amino acid concentrations is broadly consistent with our observations.
Advantages of the VDTS-NMR method are that it can capture all polar
metabolites, not just amino acids, and it is not compromised by hemolymph
evaporation nor by any potential errors derived from sample volume
calculations using the assumed internal diameter of the Tygon-tubing/capillary
collection device.

Further investigations will be required to
reveal the biological
mechanisms underlying the surprising and marked sex-specific differences
in larval hemolymph that were observed in this study. However, we
note that the average larval masses of fed males compared to fed females
and fed vs NR animals5,39 appear to correlate with the
VDTS-derived hemolymph volumes. It is also interesting that female
larvae grow at a higher rate than their male counterparts and attain
a larger pupal mass. Hence it is possible that females deplete their
hemolymph nutrients more substantially than males during the larval
growth period. Consistent with this speculation, when larval growth
is equalized close to zero for both genders during NR, most sex-specific
differences in metabolite concentrations are lost.

Conclusion
We have applied 1H NMR spectroscopy to the analysis
of polar metabolites in Drosophila larval hemolymph
under two different dietary regimes. In order to obtain a properly
meaningful multivariate analysis of the sex- and diet-dependent measurements,
we developed a practical procedure (VDTS) that allows for the precise
and accurate determination of the analyte starting volumes. Based
upon these volume measurements, we could establish absolute metabolite
concentrations under each condition. We propose that VDTS therefore
provides a useful tool for further study of small volume mixtures
by 1H NMR, and is particularly beneficial when the presumption
of conservation of spectral mass is questionable. We predict that,
with minor modifications, the VDTS procedure could be usefully adapted
to other measurement methods such as LC-MS.
