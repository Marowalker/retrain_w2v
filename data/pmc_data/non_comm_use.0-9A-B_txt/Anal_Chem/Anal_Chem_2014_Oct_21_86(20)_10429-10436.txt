Intratumor
heterogeneity remains a major obstacle to effective
cancer therapy and personalized medicine. Current understanding points
to differential therapeutic response among subpopulations of tumor
cells as a key challenge to successful treatment. To advance our understanding
of how this heterogeneity is reflected in cell-to-cell variations
in chemosensitivity and expression of drug-resistance proteins, we
optimize and apply a new targeted proteomics modality, single-cell
western blotting (scWestern), to a human glioblastoma
cell line. To acquire both phenotypic and proteomic data on the same,
single glioblastoma cells, we integrate high-content imaging prior
to the scWestern assays. The scWestern
technique supports thousands of concurrent single-cell western blots,
with each assay comprised of chemical lysis of single cells seated
in microwells, protein electrophoresis from those microwells into
a supporting polyacrylamide (PA) gel layer, and in-gel antibody probing.
We systematically optimize chemical lysis and subsequent polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of the single-cell lysate. The scWestern slides are stored for months then reprobed, thus
allowing archiving and later analysis as relevant to sparingly limited,
longitudinal cell specimens. Imaging and scWestern
analysis of single glioblastoma cells dosed with the chemotherapeutic
daunomycin showed both apoptotic (cleaved caspase 8- and annexin V-positive)
and living cells. Intriguingly, living glioblastoma subpopulations
show up-regulation of a multidrug resistant protein, P-glycoprotein
(P-gp), suggesting an active drug efflux pump as a potential mechanism
of drug resistance. Accordingly, linking of phenotype with targeted
protein analysis with single-cell resolution may advance our understanding
of drug response in inherently heterogeneous cell populations, such
as those anticipated in tumors.

Individual
cells within a tumor
vary widely with respect to their chemotherapeutic sensitivity. This
cell-to-cell heterogeneity is widely acknowledged to play key roles
in chemoresistance and tumor recurrence.1,2 Strikingly,
even genetically identical cells in the same local environment can
exhibit differences in cellular signaling during drug response.3,4 Potential mechanisms for resistance to chemotherapy are diverse
and can include expression of drug efflux pumps (possibly by P-glycoprotein,
P-gp5,6) and aberrant activation of NF-kB7 to alterations of apoptosis pathways.8 To tease apart these mechanisms, a wide range
of cellular assays are employed, including pooled cell population
assays (e.g., slab-gel western blot, cytotoxicity assays). While pooled
cell assays are widely used, signal from populations of rare, drug-resistant
cells can be lost in cell averaging, thus obscuring critical aspects
of cell-to-cell variation in drug response.

Novel single-cell
tools are emerging to aid the study of drug response.9,10 For example, single-cell gain-of-function or loss-of-function manipulations
with synthetic fluorescent-protein fusion readouts are powerful but
potentially perturb protein function.2 Nanostructure
initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) is a label-free, matrix-free tool
for studying cellular proliferation in single-cells by analyzing endogenous
metabolites in response to drug treatment.11 While NIMS is promising, the technique demands an impressive laboratory
infrastructure, which hinders widespread access. Microfluidic approaches
that assay both signal (e.g., kinase activity) and response with single-cell
resolution are also promising;12 however,
the throughput remains low.

Standard workhorse single-cell protein
analyses include immunocytochemistry
(ICC) via fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. While these
single-cell immunoassays are ubiquitous, they are unfortunately highly
dependent on antibody quality and availability. When antibodies to
a target do exist, false positive signals arising from antibody cross-reactivity
are a risk.13,14 To mitigate antibody probe cross-reactivity,
western blotting has become a workhorse tool, a multistep assay that
relies on antibody binding for detection, typically after an upstream
protein sizing step that affords enhanced assay specificity. Yet,
conventional western blotting does not offer single-cell resolution.

To bring the selectivity of western blotting to single-cell analyses,
we have recently introduced single-cell western blotting (scWestern) for simultaneously assaying thousands of cells,
with single-cell resolution, in a 4-h workflow.16 The scWestern comprises an array of thousands
of microwells stippled into a thin layer of photoactive polyacrylamide
(PA) gel. Cells are settled into the microwells and chemically lysed in situ, and then each single-cell lysate is subjected to
PA gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and UV-initiated blotting (immobilization
via benzophenone methacrylamide monomer cross-linked into the gel).
The lysates are then probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies
and scanned on a conventional microarray scanner. scWestern supports multiplexed detection of protein targets, including
intracellular proteins (i.e., 9 serial stripping and reprobing cycles
using 11 antibody sets16). Here, we illustrate
the robustness of archival scWestern slides to long-term
storage and subsequent reprobing, thus providing the opportunity for
study of new protein targets (in the original cell sample) as biological
hypotheses mature. The multiplexing capabilities coupled with the
unique archival qualities make scWestern an alternative
bench top to flow cytometry as a single-cell resolution protein analysis
tool.

Here, we interface the scWestern assay
with intact
whole-cell imaging, thus facilitating imaging-based phenotypic assessment
of live cells (in the microwells). Phenotypic data is then correlated
with subsequent protein analyses to characterize cell-to-cell variation
in drug response in a culture model of human glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM). As is needed to understand drug resistance, we conduct phenotype
imaging via phase contrast imaging, DNA staining for cell identification,
daunomycin (DNR) imaging to assess drug uptake, and Annexin V signal
to assess cell viability. We optimize the scWestern
assay, including cell lysis, PAGE, and archiving, and then directly
correlate drug uptake and cell viability and protein targets (cleaved
caspase 8, P-gP) with single-cell resolution, a capability that may
help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of drug treatment failure,
thus informing treatment regimens.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Daunomycin (D8809-1MG), tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED, T9281), ammonium persulfate (APS, A3678), β-mercaptoethanol
(M3148), and 30%T, 2.7%C acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (37.5:1) (A3699)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Triton X-100 (BP-151) was purchased
from ThermoFisher Scientific. Premixed 10× Tris/glycine/SDS electrophoresis
buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3; 192 mM glycine; 0.1% SDS) was purchased
from BioRad. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ) was obtained using an
Ultrapure water system from Millipore. N-[3-[(3-Benzoylphenyl)formamido]propyl]
methacrylamide (BPMAC) was custom synthesized by PharmAgra Laboratories.
Note that the BPMAC used in the previous studies was synthesized in-house17,18 and is a positional isomer (para-form, N-[3-[(4-benzoylphenyl)formamido]propyl]
methacrylamide) of the BPMAC used in the present study.

Antibodies
Antibodies employed for system characterization
include goat anti-GAPDH (1:10, SAB25000450, Sigma, with anti-goat
secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555), rabbit anti-β-tubulin
(1:10, ab6046, Abcam, with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 647 or 594), mouse anti-GAPDH (1:10, GTX627408, Genetex,
with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647),
rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 8 (1:10, 9496, Cell Signaling, with anti-rabbit
secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647), and rabbit anti-P-glycoprotein
(1:10, ab168336, Abcam, with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 647).

Cell Lines
U373 MG human glioblastoma
cells were obtained
from the UC Berkeley Tissue Culture Facility via the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in high glucose DMEM (11965,
Life Technologies) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (11360-070,
Life Technologies), 1× MEM nonessential amino acids (11140050,
Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (15140122, Invitrogen),
and 10% of calf serum (JR Scientific) and maintained in a humidified
37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. For protein diffusion
experiments, U373 MG cells stably transduced with GFP by lentiviral
infection (multiplicity of infection = 10) were kindly provided by
Dr. Ching-Wei Chang in Prof. S. Kumar’s Laboratory. Both U373
MG and U373-GFP cells were maintained in the same media. We note that
ATCC U373 MG cells have been discovered to share a common origin with
the human glioblastoma line U251 MG, but that the two lines appear
to have diverged to exhibit distinct karyotypes and drug sensitivities.19

DNR-Induced Cytotoxicity Assay
DNR
cytotoxicity was
assessed via a WST-1 cell proliferation assay (5015944, Roche). After
seeding in 96-well plates and culturing overnight, the cells were
incubated with DNR (with a final concentration ranging from 0.001
to 5 μM, diluted by complete culture media) for 24 h. The cells
were incubated with fresh serum-free medium containing 0.5 mg/mL WST-1
for 1 h at 37 °C for the cytotoxicity assay. The absorbance at
450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (uQuant, Biotek). For
apoptotic-cell staining, the cells were cultured overnight, treated
with DNR (5 μM) for 24 h, harvested, and then resuspended in
Annexin V binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cell suspensions were stained with Annexin
V (Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate, A23204, Life Technologies) for 15 min
at room temperature, stopped by adding Annexin V binding buffer, and
cells were then directly settled on scWestern slides.

SU8 Wafer and scWestern Slide Fabrication
The SU8 wafer and scWestern slide fabrication
were performed as detailed previously.16 For the purified protein solution calibration experiments, microwell
feature heights and diameters were 60 and 100 μm, respectively.
For experiments utilizing cells, microwell feature heights and diameters
were 30 and 32 μm, respectively. The PA gel layer on the scWestern slides was chemically polymerized using 0.08%
APS and 0.08% TEMED.

scWestern
The scWestern
blotting procedure comprises six steps.16 First, 1 million U373 cells are gravity-settled onto the scWestern slide, followed by washing three times by PBS
to remove excess cells off the surface. Second, in situ cell lysis is performed by directly pouring the lysis buffer over
the slide. Third, lysate is analyzed via PAGE (E =
40 V cm–1). Fourth, protein bands are immobilized
by UV activation of the benzophenone (Lightningcure LC5, Hamamatsu).
Fifth, the scWestern slides are diffusion-probed
by antibodies and finally scanned by a fluorescence microarray scanner
(Genepix 4300A, Molecular Devices).

Purified Protein Experiments
Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
purified trypsin inhibitor (TI, T23011, 20 kDa) and Alexa Fluor 555-labeled
purified bovine serum albumin (BSA, A34786, 65 kDa) were purchased
from Life Technologies. The purified proteins were diluted to a final
concentration of 1 μM in PBS. We incubated the purified protein
with different %T of PA for 30 min and then performed PAGE. After
UV immobilization of electrophoresed proteins, the gel slides were
washed in TBST for 30 min, air-dried and scanned via the fluorescence
microarray scanner.

Fluorescence Imaging
Real-time cell
lysis was imaged
using a time-lapse acquisition mode controlled by MetaMorph software
(Molecular Devices) with 50 ms exposure times, 500 ms time intervals,
at 1 × 1 pixel binning through a 10× magnification objective
(Olympus UPlanFLN, NA 0.45) on an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence
microscope equipped with an Andor iXon+ EMCCD camera, ASI motorized
stage, and shuttered mercury lamp light source (X-cite, Lumen Dynamics).
The first four images were discarded owing to the fluctuation from
addition of lysis buffer. Fluorescence signal from a region of interest
(ROI) covering the whole microwell was integrated at intervals during
lysis. Fluorescence signal from an adjacent, empty microwell was assigned
as the background signal. Each integrated intensity value was background-subtracted
and normalized to the value at the start of lysis (t = 0). For high-content imaging, the entire microscope slide was
imaged using a multidimensional acquisition mode controlled by MetaMorph
software and collected through a 4× magnification objective (Olympus
UPlanFLN, NA 0.13) on the same microscope. The fluorescence signal
was obtained using a standard DAPI filter cube for a DNA stain, Hoechst
33342 (B2261, Sigma), a TRITC filter cube for DNR, and a Cy5 filter
cube for Annexin V staining. All images were analyzed by ImageJ 1.46r
(NIH). All plots were graphed by OriginPro 8.5.0.

Imaging Processing
and Performance Quantification
Quantification
of protein PAGE and probing used in-house scripts written in R (http://www.r-project.org).16 Bands
widths were characterized by Gaussian curve fitting in MATLAB (R2013b,
Curve Fitting Toolbox).

Results and Discussion
In-Gel Probing and High-Performance
PAGE
The scWestern architecture comprises
an array of microwells
stippled into a thin layer (30 μm) of photoactive PA gel, all
layered on a glass microscope slide (Figure 1).16 To yield westerns with single-cell
resolution, a suspension of cells is first gravity-settled into the
microwells. Microwell diameters are selected to favor one cell per
microwell occupancy. High-content imaging of intact cells seated in
microwells is completed using both phase contrast and fluorescence
imaging. After imaging, the cells are chemically lysed in
situ. Immediately following lysis, the lysate from each single
cell is subjected to western analysis: PAGE, blotting of resolved
proteins via in situ UV-initiated immobilization
to the benzophenone PA gel, and probing with primary and then fluorescently
labeled secondary antibodies.

Figure 1 Single-cell phenotype imaging and western blotting
workflow. The scWestern array is comprised of a thin
layer of photoactive
PA gel that (A) houses single-cells in microwells, (B) enables fluorescence
and phase contrast imaging of intact cells providing information on
cell phenotype, and (C, D) supports subsequent western blotting steps
after in situ cell lysis for proteomic analyses.

Importantly, the microwell array
is designed such that the pitch
between each row of microwells is defined by the length of the PAGE
separation axis. This spacing constraint presents a trade-off between
PAGE separation resolution, which benefits from long separation distances,
and array density, which allows analysis of larger number of single
cells. Given a fixed maximum operating power for the high voltage
power supplies employed, we sought to design a scWestern with (1) a short, 1 mm long separation axis for each PAGE
assay and (2) PAGE performance suitable for analysis of proteins in
the 15 to 90 kDa range, thus making the scWestern
broadly relevant to cytosolic signaling proteins (Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information).20 To meet these two design specifications, we first investigated the
selectivity imparted by the molecular sieving matrix as a function
of the PA gel pore size. While gels with smaller pore sizes confer
enhanced sizing discrimination and selectivity,21,22 decreasing the gel pore size below a critical value will adversely
impact antibody transport into the gel during the probing steps.

Accordingly, to achieve high separation performance we assessed
PAGE separation resolution (SR) (Figure 2 and
Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information). PA gel densities spanning from 7%T to 10%T (%T, total acrylamide)
were assessed using a purified, fluorescently labeled protein ladder
(BSA and TI). Full-field, single time-point imaging was employed;
thus PAGE was suspended when the highest mobility species (TI) reached
the end of the 1 mm separation distance. As such, comparisons are
between PAGE assays having the same separation distance (1 mm) but
different separation durations.

Figure 2 Microscale PAGE performance improves with
smaller PA gel pore size.
(A) False-color fluorescence micrographs of a 1 mm long PAGE separation
distance for a range of PA gel densities. A purified fluorescently
labeled two-component protein standard was used: TI (magenta signal)
and BSA (blue signal). PAGE was halted when the fastest standard species
reached the separation axis terminus (21 s, 7%T; 20 s, 8%T; 23 s,
9%T; 26 s 10%T). Highlighted circular features indicate 30 μm
diameter microwells. (B) SR improves as gel pore size is reduced.
Box ends indicate 25th and 75th quantiles; line at box middle indicates
median value; whiskers extend to 95% confidence limits; and outliers
marked with “×”. SR in the 10%T PA gel was significantly
higher than that at 9%T PA gel (t test, two tailed, p-value = 2.72 × 10–20). E = 40 V cm–1.

PAGE analysis of BSA revealed both high and low electrophoretic
mobility forms, with the lower mobility species likely a covalent
dimer of BSA (BSA*; 130 kDa).16,20 As PAGE was designed
to analyze the 15–90 kDa molecular mass range relevant to most
cytosolic proteins, we observed retention of the large BSA multimer
near the edge of the microwell. For the faster mobility species (TI
and the highest mobility BSA form), we observed notably more disperse
bands in the 7%T PA gel (FWHMTI = 58.9 ± 10.7 μm
and FWHMBSA = 35.2 ± 8.1 μm, ± SD, n = 57 separations) as compared to the smaller pore-size
10%T gel (FWHMTI = 44.22 ± 6.91 μm and FWHMBSA = 24.2 ± 4.9 μm, ± SD, n = 103 separations). Accordingly, a marked increase in SR was observed
with the smaller pore-size gels (Figure 2B).
In particular, while the BSA and TI were not resolved in a 7%T gel
(SR = 0.56 ± 0.08, ± SD, n = 57 separations),
the species were resolved in the smallest pore-size gel (10%T gel;
SR = 1.04 ± 0.09, ± SD, n = 103 separations)
with all other conditions comparable. As anticipated for this molecular
mass range, higher separation performance was observed with the smallest
pore-size gel (10%T). We did not explore lower pore-size gels, as
a 150 kDa antibody is ∼30 nm in size23 and gel pore sizes of ∼20 nm are expected in 10.5%T, 5%C
PA gels.24 In addition to pore size exclusion
limitations, partitioning reduces the local, in-gel antibody concentration
compared to the bulk solution.25 A locally
lower antibody concentration yields less than optimal probing performance.
Taken together, a 10%T PA gel proved suitable for scWestern assays (including PAGE performance and antibody probing)
for a broad range of cytosolic signaling proteins.

Microwell in Situ Chemical Lysis of U373 MG
Cells
The scWestern workflow dictates that
the cell lysis and protein extraction buffer act also as the electrophoresis
run buffer. Thus, a single buffer must provide both effective cytoplasmic
protein extraction and a low conductivity (to support electrophoresis).
To meet these constraints, a modified RIPA buffer16 was employed for cell lysis, protein extraction, and subsequent
electrophoresis. The 12 mM Tris/96 mM glycine (pH 8.3) buffer contained
0.5% SDS, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. The
modified RIPA buffer was poured directly onto the scWestern surface. In comparison, a standard RIPA buffer is 25 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40 (nonionic detergent), and
1% sodium deoxycholate. In conventional western blotting, extracted
proteins are typically heat denatured (5–10 min) in the presence
of reducing reagents prior to protein sizing. In contrast, the multifunctional scWestern lysis and electrophoresis buffer provides denaturing
but nonreducing conditions, with a short lysis period (20 s) to minimize
protein diffusional losses from the shallow microwells.16,17 The 20 s in situ chemical lysis period is not expected
to impact levels of P-glycoprotein (employed in the drug study) owing
to an estimated 16 h protein half-life (4 h mRNA half-life).26 While a 20 s lysis period may perturb signaling
for species with short signaling time scales, a range of “fast”
induced signaling systems are understood to change the protein modification
on the order of minutes, not seconds (e.g., phosphorylation of AKT
and ERK1/2 after 4 min of EGF stimulation27 or activation of Src by EGF stimulation28).

To enhance cell lysis and protein extraction efficiency
without the addition of high conductivity species, we explored cell
lysis at elevated temperatures (50 °C using the modified RIPA
buffer, Figure 3). While 95 °C is typically
used for in-tube cell lysate preparation, minimizing lysate diffusion
out of the 30-μm deep microwells during lysis is a design constraint
of the scWestern. Elevated temperature enhances diffusion.
Most proteins are denatured at 50 °C.29−31

Figure 3 In situ chemical lysis of cells in microwells
at elevated temperatures and with enclosed microwells notably improves scWestern performance. (A) False-color fluorescence micrographs
and intensity profiles show scWesterns after cool
(left, 4 °C) and hot (right, 50 °C) lysis buffer conditions,
suggesting a fully resolved protein pair, GAPDH (magenta signal) and
β-tubulin (blue signal) under the 50 °C lysis conditions.
(B) Fluorescence micrographs during in-microwell lysis of U373-GFP
cells under 4 and 50 °C lysis conditions in systems with (enclosed)
and without (open) a lid covering the microwell, suggest an enclosed
microwell architecture can mitigate protein losses during cell lysis.
(C) Time course of the total integrated GFP fluorescence signal from

Alexa Fluor 555-labeled secondary antibody; β-tubulin, Alexa
Fluor 647-labeled secondary antibody).

To understand the impact of lysis buffer temperature on scWestern performance, we scrutinized (i) downstream PAGE
performance and (ii) diffusional losses from the microwell for the
different lysis buffer temperature conditions. Glioblastoma (U373
MG) cells were gravity-settled into microwells on a scWestern slide, subjected to either a 4 or 50 °C modified RIPA
lysis/extraction/electrophoresis buffer for 20 s and extracted proteins
then analyzed by protein PAGE for 40 s (1 mm long separation distance,
10%T PA gel). Lysis buffer temperature was measured with a thermometer
immediately before buffer was poured on the scWestern
surface. We assayed two widely used internal control proteins, β-tubulin
(55 kDa) and GAPDH (35 kDa) in the U373 MG (Figure 3A and Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information).

The scWestern yielded a fully resolved
peak pair
with SR = 1.36 ± 0.73 (± SD, n = 70 cells)
under the 50 °C lysis conditions. In contrast, the 4 °C
lysis condition yielded unresolvable peaks for β-tubulin and
GAPDH. In the 4 °C lysis condition, the apparent electrophoretic
mobility of β-tubulin was 0.44 ± 0.05 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 (±
SD, n = 11 cells) and that of GAPDH was 0.26 ±
0.06 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 (± SD, n = 11 cells).
Under the 50 °C cell lysis condition, the apparent electrophoretic
mobilities were 6.60 ± 0.08 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 (± SD, n = 11 cells) and 8.88 ± 0.14 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 (±
SD, n = 11 cells) for β-tubulin and GAPDH,
respectively. Intriguingly, the 50 °C lysis conditions notably
improved the electrophoretic injection of both protein standards into
the 10%T PA gel. Further, when comparing the 4 and 50 °C conditions,
the apparent electrophoretic mobility of the GAPDH “over-speeds”
that of the β-tubulin. The exceedingly low mobility of GAPDH
in the 4 °C conditions may be attributable to non fully dissociated
and non fully denatured native tetramer forms of GAPDH.32 Accordingly, the 50 °C lysis condition
resulted in notably less dispersion during PAGE (Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information). As high melting temperature
proteins (e.g., proteins with disulfide bonds) may not be fully denatured
at 50 °C,33 the addition of DTT, β-mercaptoenthanol,
or increased concentrations of SDS to the lysis buffer could be considered
if inadequate electrophoretic separation performance is observed.

Second, we assessed protein losses from the microwells under the
4 and 50 °C lysis buffer conditions. As a model cell system,
we employed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transfected U373 MG
cell line (U373-GFP). GFP (27 kDa) acts as a marker of small molecular
mass cytosolic proteins during lysis. Importantly, GFP is expected
to emit fluorescence signal under both lysis temperature conditions
considered and with SDS treatment (up to 0.5%) at pH 8.5.34−36 The effects of heating and photobleaching on GFP were minimal (Figure
S-5 in the Supporting Information).

Comparison of the in-microwell GFP signal after introduction of
the lysis buffer shows substantially faster transport of the GFP out
of the microwell under the 50 °C lysis conditions, as compared
to the 4 °C lysis conditions (Figure 3B). Here, the initial GFP fluorescence signal (prior to cell lysis, t = 0) was normalized to unity. Notably, for the 4 °C
lysis condition the GFP fluorescence signal remained above 50% of
the initial signal at even 10 s of lysis duration (Figure 3C). However, the GFP fluorescence signal dipped
below 50% of the initial signal after just 3 s of lysis with the 50
°C buffer conditions. By 10 s of lysis time, the GFP signal was
<10% of the initial signal under the 50 °C lysis buffer conditions.

We next measured GFP fluorescence signal after lysis (20 s at either
4 or 50 °C), protein extraction, and PAGE (Figure S-6 in the Supporting Information). Strong GFP fluorescence
was observed after PAGE and immobilization under the 4 °C lysis
buffer conditions. In contrast, the GFP fluorescence was almost undetectable
after PAGE and UV immobilization under the 50 °C lysis buffer
conditions while internal control proteins (GAPDH and β-tubulin)
with larger molecular mass than GFP were detectable (Figure 3A). Comparison of the two lysis temperatures across
multiple U373-GFP cells revealed that the 4 °C lysis condition
(n = 30 cells) yielded a 9-fold higher average GFP
signal than that measured under the 50 °C condition (n = 48 cells) (Figure S-6 in the Supporting
Information).

We attribute the lower measured signal
at elevated temperatures
to effective cell lysis with enhanced diffusional losses out of the
microwells during the process. We examined the effectiveness of cell
lysis and diffusional losses at an intermediate lysis buffer temperature
(37 °C, in comparison to a lower temperature 4 °C condition
and an elevated temperature 50 °C condition, Figure S-7 in the Supporting Information). As expected, we observed
a reduction in diffusional losses of GFP at 37 °C offset by protein
extraction and solubilization that yielded a suboptimal subsequent
electrophoretic separation of GAPDH and β-tubulin. Consequently,
we introduced a lid to enclose the microwell and limit protein mass
losses during the lysis process (Figure 3B,
bottom panel). The lid-based system is detailed in the Supporting Information (Figure S-8). Use of the
lid system improved retention of GFP in the microwell, as compared
to the open microwell system.

Integration of High-Content
Imaging with scWesterns
We sought to develop scWesterns
suitable for the simultaneous study of both drug-induced single-cell
phenotypes and targeted proteomics. To accomplish imaging and single-cell
protein analysis, we applied imaging (bright-field, fluorescence)
and subsequent endpoint scWesterns to study cell-to-cell
variation in the response of U373 MG cells to the small-molecule chemotherapeutic
daunomycin (a.k.a., daunorubicin, DNR). We assessed the response to
DNR treatment using the WST-1 proliferation assay (Figure S-9 in the Supporting Information). U373 MG cells were stimulated
with 5 μM DNR treatment for 24 h in a standard culture system,
then collected and assessed for apoptosis (via staining, Annexin V
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647). Finally, both attached and buoyant
cells (the latter being likely apoptotic) were collected and settled
on the scWestern.

We collected bright-field
and fluorescence images of control U373 MG cells and DNR-treated U373
MG cells with both positive and negative Annexin V staining (Figure 4A). Immediately after imaging, we performed scWestern blotting and probed for GAPDH, an internal control
protein, and cleaved caspase 8, an apoptosis marker37 (Figure 4A and Figure S-10 in the Supporting Information). We observed a positive
correlation between the two apoptotic markers, annexin V and cleaved
caspase 8 (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.98755, n = 31 cells), confirming a strong association between phenotype
and protein expression at the single-cell level (Figure 4B). We also estimated a false positive rate of less than 1.0%
(1 single-cell western blot registered as empty during imaging yet
reported a positive protein peak upon western blotting, see Figure
S-11 in the Supporting Information). False
positives may arise from diffusional “cross-talk” between
occupied wells and neighboring empty wells. The false negative rate
is estimated at ∼30% (6 microwells registered imaging data
yet no result upon western blotting). The false negative rate is attributed
to diffusional losses of material from occupied wells.

imaging with scWesterns.

cell (upper panel), DNR-treated living cell (middle panel), and DNR-treated
apoptotic cell (lower panel). The living cells showed no annexin V
staining and cleaved caspase 8 signal, whereas the apoptotic cells
showed positive annexin V and cleaved caspase 8 signal. (B) Positive
correlation between the apoptotic markers: cleaved caspase 8 and annexin
V signal (r = 0.98755). (C) The distribution of cleaved
caspase 8-negative and cleaved caspase 8-positive between control
and DNR-treated cells defines the positive population of apoptotic
cells. Each cleaved caspase 8 signal is normalized to its β-tubulin
signal. The dashed line is the 0.2 threshold (control, n = 79 cells; DNR, n = 153 cells). (D) The shifted
distribution of P-gp expression in DNR-treated cells compared to control
cells suggests the possible existence of adaptive resistance after
drug treatment. Each P-gp signal is normalized to its β-tubulin
signal. The dashed line is the 0.1 threshold (control, n = 73 cells; DNR, n = 141 cells). (E) Scatter plot
of apoptotic (red dots) and living (blue dots) cells as well as P-gp
and DNR uptake shows more living cells with moderate to high P-gp
expression. E = 40 V cm–1, lysis
time = 20 s, electrophoresis time = 30 s, 10%T PA gel.

We further examined the distribution of cleaved
caspase 8 signals
between control and DNR-treated U373 MG cells (Figure 4C). On the basis of the distribution of cleaved caspase 8
signal in control U373 MG cells (Figure S-12 in the Supporting Information), we defined a fluorescence signal
threshold as 0.2 (the ratio of cleaved caspase 8 to β-tubulin)
and further identified 20% apoptotic cells (n = 31/153
cells) in DNR-treated U373 MG cells. Intriguingly, while examining
the correlation between DNR uptake and cleaved caspase 8 signal (Figure
S-13 in the Supporting Information), we
observed that an increase in DNR uptake did not positively correlate
with cell apoptosis. For example, the DNR-treated U373 MG cell indicated
as cell number 2 had high DNR intensity but was a living cell with
no detectable cleaved caspase 8 signal or annexin V signal detectable
(Figure S-13 in the Supporting Information).

One possible mechanism for drug resistance in cancer cells
is the
active efflux of anticancer drugs through the cellular membrane by
multidrug resistance proteins, such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family, P-glycoprotein (P-gp).38 Of particular interest, chemotherapy resistance to anthracycline
based drugs (e.g., doxorubicin and vincristine) has been attributed
to up-regulation of P-gp.39 As such, we
employed the scWesterns to assay P-gp expression
in DNR-treated U373 MG cells. The size of probed P-gp is 140 kDa,
which is excluded from the small pore-size 10%T gel and thus is clearly
retained near the edge of the microwells (Figure S-14 in the Supporting Information). On the basis of the scWestern results, we compared P-gp expression between control
and DNR-treated U373 MG cells (Figure 4D) and
found that the two groups expressed P-gp at significantly different
levels (p-value = 0.007, two-tailed t-test; control, n = 73 cells; DNR, n = 141 cells). On the basis of the distribution of P-gp expression
in control and DNR-treated U373 MG cells (Figure S-15 in the Supporting Information), we defined a fluorescence
signal threshold as 0.1 (the ratio of P-gp to β-tubulin) and
further identified 62% cells (n = 87/141 cells) expressing
high P-gp levels in DNR-treated U373 MG cells; whereas only 33% cells
expressing high P-gp levels (n = 24/73 cells) in
control U373 MG cells. The observation suggests the possible existence
of adaptive resistance after drug treatment.40,41

As a drug efflux pump, an inverse correlation between drug
uptake
and P-gp is expected if P-gp is the major drug resistance mechanism.
Drug-resistant viable cells are hypothesized to express high levels
of P-gp with low DNR uptake, while drug-sensitive apoptotic cells
would express the converse (low levels of P-gp expression with high
DNR uptake). After DNR treatment, we analyzed the correlation between
DNR uptake and P-gp expression in living (cleaved caspase 8-negative)
and apoptotic (cleaved caspase 8-positive) cells (Figure 4E). As expected, we observed living cells exhibiting
moderate to high P-gp expression and relatively low DNR uptake. The
observation suggests the possible existence of a P-gp dependent drug
resistant population.

Intriguingly, scWestern
analysis also identified
a subpopulation of living cells with high DNR uptake and relatively
low P-gp expression. Statistical comparison found no correlation between
P-gp expression and drug uptake (Pearson correlation coefficient r = −0.4559, p-value = 0.1, two-tailed t-test against the null hypothesis). Our working conclusion
finds P-gp is not a major contributor to drug uptake or drug resistance
under these conditions. Rare events, such as living cells with high
DNR uptake, may be attributable to a non-P-gp associated drug resistance
mechanism through, for example, the overexpression of an antiapoptotic
protein, Bcl-2,8,38 and is a topic of future inquiry.

Archiving of scWestern Slides
Given
the findings of the high-content imaging and scWestern
tool regarding non-P-gp drug resistance mechanisms, we sought to facilitate
future reanalysis of scWestern slides. Consequently,
we evaluated long-term storage for archiving and subsequent reprobing
of scWestern slides (Figure 5). To explore archival capability, scWesterns were
conducted, probed with GAPDH, rinsed with deionized water, and air-dried
before storage. We observed that the thickness of a 10%T PA gel decreases
by ∼10% after archival preparation (Figure 5A). We evaluated the GADPH antibody probe fluorescence signal
before and after 4 months of archival storage at room temperature
(Figure 5B and Figure S-16 in the Supporting Information). The integrated total
fluorescence of probed GAPDH after the 4-month storage period was
83.8 ± 8.9% (± SD, n = 28 cells) of the
signal before archival storage. While archival storage of probed scWestern slides is feasible, we further attempted to reprobe
and strip β-tubulin at a scWestern slide after
7 months of storage (Figure 5C and Figure S-17
in the Supporting Information). For chemical
stripping, slides were incubated for 3 h in 55 °C stripping buffer
(2.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mM Tris titrated
to pH 6.8 with HCl). We observed strong stripping with just 5.3 ±
1.6% (± SD, n = 426 cells) of the initial β-tubulin
antibody probe signal retained on the gel (Figure S-17 in the Supporting Information). The apparent probed
β-tubulin signal and the subsequent strong stripping suggest
the feasibility of reprobing a scWestern slide after
long-term archival storage. The robustness of scWestern
slides affords the opportunity for probing of new protein targets
in the future, as is especially critical in analysis of sparingly
available longitudinal clinical biospecimens.

Conclusions
Recent strides to enhance our understanding
of cancer have been
primarily focused on characterizing genetic aberration to tumor initiation
or progression at the genomic or transcriptomic level. With improvements
of DNA sequencing technologies, large-scale collaborative initiatives,
such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have extensively mapped genotype
to phenotype in different cancers.42,43 For example,
the integrated information from copy number alterations, exome sequencing,
and mRNA assays have helped define breast cancer subtypes and further
discover druggable targets.42 However,
we know that the proteomic states are dynamic, and crosstalk among
proteins occurs frequently in signaling cascades.44 Especially for single time point experiments, findings
suggest that fewer than 50% of proteins with measurable changes in
abundance are accompanied by changes in the corresponding mRNA.45 Therefore, direct association of proteotype
to phenotype is of importance.

Integrated with intact cell imaging,
the scWestern
platform provides high-specificity protein measurement with single-cell
resolution, as it is directly relevant to the study of cell-to-cell
variation in drug response. Advances in assay design and development
focus first on addressing the coupled requirements of effective molecular
sieving by the PA gel and effective subsequent in-gel antibody probing
of target proteins in that same gel. A second focus centers on reducing
lysate losses from the microwells during the chemical lysis process.
A lid-based system is observed to confine lysate to the microwells
for a longer duration than possible with open microwells. With enhanced scWestern performance, the scWestern microarray
format is integrated with high-content imaging of intact cells in
the microwells prior to blotting. Integration of intact single-cell
imaging allows direct correlation between phenotypic outcomes and
proteomic profiles from the same cell. The multistage, single-cell
assay reported here offers a throughput in the electrophoresis stage
(5 min handling time) of ∼30 cells/min demonstrated for 153
cells total (Figure 4). A larger or denser
microwell array would allow electrophoretic analysis of a larger number
of single cells in the same total assay duration. When coupled with
the subsequent blotting and probing, a 4 h rate limiting step, that
comprise western blotting, the scWestern throughput
is ∼0.6 cells/min. This conservative throughput can be easily
scaled up by probing multiple slides simultaneously. When integrated
with high-content imaging of intact cells prior to electrophoresis,
the assay throughput falls considerably to ∼0.1 cells/min,
as would be expected without the use of a high-speed live-cell imaging
system.

To shed light on a possible mechanism for cancer drug
resistance
involving the active efflux of anticancer drugs through the cell membrane
by P-gp, we employ the scWestern to assay P-gp in
DNR-treated glioblastoma cell line (U373 MG). Correlation of intact
cell imaging data with single-cell resolution proteomic data may provide
a means for identifying small subpopulations of cells that exhibit
drug resistance. While single-cell analyses, such as the scWestern, detect rare phenotypes in a population of cancer cells,
the importance of those rare and often hard-to-replicate measurements
is still being assessed (Figure S-18 in the Supporting
Information). Nevertheless, the integration of high-content
imaging with high specificity scWesterns offers a
new tool for measuring cell-to-cell variation in response to drug
treatment.
