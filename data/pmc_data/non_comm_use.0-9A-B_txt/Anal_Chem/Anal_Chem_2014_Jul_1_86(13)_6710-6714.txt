Synthetic host–guest chemistry
is a versatile tool for biomedical
applications. Characterization and detection of host–guest
complexes in biological systems, however, is challenging due to the
complexity of the biological milieu. Here, we describe and apply a
mass spectrometric method to monitor the association and dissociation
of nanoparticle (NP)-based host–guest interactions that integrates
NP-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI) and matrix assisted
laser desoption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. This LDI/MALDI
approach reveals how NP surface functionality affects host–guest
interactions in cells, information difficult to achieve using other
techniques.

Host–guest
chemistry
using engineered molecular systems provides controllable platforms
for biomedical applications such as cell targeting,1,2 biosensing,3 imaging,4 drug delivery,5−7 and cancer therapeutics.8 The reversibility
of the association/dissociation process plays a vital role in these
applications, allowing host systems to regulate the release of drug
guests.9,10 Multifunctional nanomaterials provide particularly
versatile scaffolds for these host–guest systems due to their
biocompatibility and functional versatility.8,9−11 For example, the cytotoxicity
of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be triggered in cancer cells using
competitive host–guest binding molecules, providing a new strategy
for potential therapeutic applications.8

Effective use of nanomaterial-based supramolecular chemistry
in
biomedical applications requires the ability to monitor the association
and dissociation of the noncovalent conjugates inside cells.12 Characterization of host–guest interactions
is traditionally performed in simple solutions using techniques such
as NMR13,14 and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).15,16 These methods, however, cannot be used to analyze host–guest
interactions in biological systems due to the complex environments
in cells and tissues. Fluorescence spectroscopy is an alternate strategy
to detect host–guest complexes in complicated biological samples.17 The use of florescent probes, especially when
additional labeling steps are required, can affect the biological
behavior of original host–guest complexes due to the alteration
of surface properties by the dye.18−20 Moreover, it is challenging
for this method to simultaneously probe multiple host–guest
complexes.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an effective tool for characterizing
host–guest interactions in solution.12,21−24 For example, electrospray ionization (ESI) MS25−27 and matrix
assisted laser desoption/ionization (MALDI) MS28,29 have been utilized for the detection of host–guest complexes.
However, to the best of our knowledge, detecting host–guest
interactions inside cells using MS has not been reported, due in large
part to the large number of interfering ions generated from biological
samples.

We report here a direct method to monitor the association
and dissociation
of multiple NP-based host–guest complexes inside cells (Figure 1a) using a standard MALDI mass spectrometer. Supramolecular
complexes formed by the surface ligands of AuNPs and cucurbit[7]uril
(CB[7]) serve as “mass barcodes” to indicate the presence
of AuNP-CB[7] complexes inside cells. This method integrates NP-mediated
laser desorption/ionization (LDI-MS)30−34 with MALDI using an organic matrix and acts to selectively
desorb/ionize supramolecular complexes of the ligands, allowing observation
of these species in the presence of other cellular materials. Using
this method, the intracellular association and dissociation of AuNP-CB[7]
complexes were monitored, as well as competitive dissociation of these
complexes using 1-adamantylamine (ADA) (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of the MALDI-MS detection process of
supramolecular complexes in cells. AuNP-CB[7] complexes are measured
as complex ions between CB[7] and AuNP surface ligands, and these
ions appear at m/z values above
1600. (b) Monitoring the selective dissociation of the supramolecular
complexes after adding the competitive binding molecule ADA. The addition
of ADA dissociates some AuNP-CB[7] complexes and also leads to a new
ADA-CB[7] complex ion at m/z 1314.

Experimental Section
Cell Culture Experiments
60k HeLa cells per well were
plated into a 24 well plate 24 h before the experiment. Cells were
incubated with AuNP-CB[7] complexes (250 nM, 500 μL) for 24
h in DEMEM media containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics and then washed
3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (500 μL for each
washing). Beta Gal lysis buffer (250 μL per well, 5 times diluted)
was used to lyse the cell, with the cell culture plate kept at room
temperature on a vibrator for 30 min.

ADA Treatment
60k HeLa cells were treated with a single
type of NP-CB[7] complex or a mixture of three NP-CB[7] complexes
for 24 h. Then, they were washed 3 times with PBS (500 μL) and
treated with ADA at a concentration of 1.8 and 3.6 μM for 1
h (total ADA amount: 0.9 and 1.8 nmol, respectively). After that,
cells were washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with Beta Gal lysis buffer.

Cell Sample Preparation for MALDI-MS
The cell lysate
samples were transferred from the 24-well cell culture plate to 1.5
mL centrifuge tubes. Then, they were centrifuged at 14 000
rpm for 30 min. After removal of the supernatant containing the lysis
buffer, the pellets were transferred to the stainless steel MALDI-MS
sample carrier. A saturated solution of the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (α-CHCA) solution was prepared in 70% acetonitrile and
30% water for the MALDI-MS analysis. 2.5 μL of the matrix solution
was applied on top of each pellet. The samples were air-dried before
MALDI-MS analysis.

MALDI-MS Instrumentation
MALDI-MS
experiments were
carried out on a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a Smartbeam 2 Nd:YAG laser.
MALDI-MS operating conditions were as follows: ion source 1 = 19.00
kV, ion source 2 = 16.60 kV, lens voltage = 8.44 kV, reflector voltage
= 20.00 kV, reflector voltage 2 = 9.69 kV, and positive reflectron
mode in a mass range of m/z 400–3000.
A total of 200 laser shots was fired per measurement. The laser energy
was optimized to ∼40 μJ/pulse. Data processing was performed
using the Bruker flexAnalysis (version 3.3) software.

Results
and Discussion
We chose the cucurbituril (CB) supramolecular
family for our studies.
These host–guest complexes are particularly promising for biomedical
applications due to their solubility in aqueous media, high affinity,
and nontoxicity.35−39 We probed intracellular CB interactions using AuNPs with three types
of surface functionalities (Figure 2a). The
AuNP-CB[7] complexes were formed by mixing AuNPs with excess CB[7]
(molar ratio of AuNP/CB[7] = 1:200). The initial LDI/MALDI-MS detection
of the AuNP-CB[7] host–guest complexes was first in simple
aqueous solutions (Figure 3).

surface functionalities on the AuNPs used
in this work. (b) The mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios of ligands and their corresponding supramolecular complexes

ligands (L ions), disulfide ions (D ions) formed by surface ligands
and pentanethiol ligands, supramolecular complex ions (C ions) formed
by surface ligand and CB[7], and disulfide ions formed by CB[7] and
D ions (DC ions).

Figure 2 caption for the identities of the
L, D, C, and DC ions.

The molecular ion of the surface ligand (L1) of AuNP 1, which has a diaminohexyl ending group, was readily detected
using
LDI/MALDI-MS (Figure 3a). The disulfide ion
(D1), previously reported in LDI/MALDI-MS analysis of self-assembled
monolayer surfaces,40−43 and the molecular ion (L1) confirmed the presence of AuNP 1. The supramolecular complex ions C1 and DC1 (formed by the
D1 ion and CB[7]) indicate the detection of the host–guest
complexes (Figure 3a, see the inset for the
enlarged region between m/z 1600
and 1800; ion identities are shown in Figure 2b). This MALDI-MS method for monitoring the AuNP-CB[7] host–guest
interactions is able to detect the intact supramolecular complexes
without generating fragments of the gold clusters44,45 or ionizing the intact AuNPs46,47 and thus provides information
on the ligand-CB[7] interaction. We applied this method to supramolecular
complexes formed by CB[7] and AuNPs with different surface functionalities,
and analogous mass spectra were acquired using AuNP 2-CB[7] and AuNP 3-CB[7] containing solutions (Figure 3b,c). The LDI/MALDI-MS characterization of the AuNP-CB[7]
supramolecular structures can also be applied to NPs with a wide range
of surface functionalities (Supporting Information, Figures S-1 and S-2).

Building on the solution phase experiments,
we next explored the
ability of this method to selectively ionize and detect NP host–guest
complexes in cells. HeLa cells were incubated with uncomplexed ligands
(250 nM) and complexed ligands (250 nM AuNP, 200 equiv of CB[7]) and
washed with PBS three times to remove the AuNPs and AuNP-CB[7] complexes
that were not taken up by the cells. After the cells were lysed, the
resulting samples were transferred to centrifuge tubes, and the pellets
containing AuNPs or AuNP-CB[7] complexes were collected after the
centrifugation (Figure 1a). The high density
of AuNPs relative to the biomolecules in the cells allows one to concentrate
the AuNPs and AuNP-CB[7] complexes to some extent, minimizing interferences
from biological molecules in the cell lysate. We then transferred
the pellets to the MALDI-MS sample carrier and applied a thin layer
of matrix on top of the pellets (Figure 1a).
Figure 4a,b shows typical LDI/MALDI mass spectra
that are obtained. The surface ligand ions (L1 and D1) are observed,
indicating the existence of AuNPs in the pellets (Figure 4a). The supramolecular ions (C1 and DC1) are also
readily observed, showing successful detection of host–guest
complexes inside cells (Figure 4b). The gold
cores of the AuNPs and the added matrix seem to work together to enable
the selective ionization of the surface ligands and complexes that
are attached to the AuNPs. Interestingly, the relative intensities
of the complexed and uncomplexed ligands in cells (Figure 4b) are different than those in solution (Figure 3a); we are investigating the origins of this disparity.

AuNP-CB[7] interactions using MALDI-MS. (a) Detection
of AuNP 1 in cells after incubation with 250 nM AuNP.
(b) Detection of AuNP 1-CB[7] ([AuNP] = 250 nM, [CB[7]]
= 50 μM) taken up by the cells. (c) The dissociation of the
host–guest complex by adding ADA (4 μM) to the cells
containing AuNP 1-CB[7].

We next used LDI/MALDI to monitor the dissociation of host–guest
complexes using ADA, a strong binding competitor for CB[7]. Since
a similar amount of particle was taken up with each of the ligands
(Supporting Information, Figure S-3), the
same amount of ADA was added for each particle. The host–guest
complex “mass barcodes,” both C1 and DC1 ions, disappear
after the cells containing AuNP-CB[7] complexes are treated with ADA
(Figure 4c), indicating the dissociation of
supramolecular complexes. Comparing the results in Figure 4a,c, ADA treatment of cells incubated previously
with AuNP 1-CB[7] complexes leads to very similar mass
spectra as the cells treated with only AuNP 1. Figure 4 demonstrates the successful tracking of the association
and dissociation of AuNP-CB[7] supramolecular complexes in cells by
LDI/MALDI-MS.

Multiple supramolecular complexes can be followed
simultaneously
using MALDI-MS.30 This multiplexed detection
could provide direct ratiometric measurements, significantly reducing
the variability introduced from studying different supramolecular
complexes in separate cell populations. Cells were incubated with
three AuNP-CB[7] complexes (AuNP 1-CB[7], AuNP 2-CB[7], and AuNP 3-CB[7]) to demonstrate this
multiplexing capability. Ions corresponding to the surface ligands
(L1, L2, and L3) of three AuNPs and the host–guest complexes
(C1, C2, and C3) are readily detected (Figure 5a); however, the intensities of the complex ions detected by MALDI-MS
vary due to the different amounts and different ionization efficiencies
of the supramolecular complexes.

complexes in cells.

complexes in the cell lysates after ADA treatment based on relative
ionization efficiencies (Supporting Information, Table S-2).

As above, ADA was used
to trigger the dissociation of the AuNP-CB[7]
complexes inside the cells. In this study, 1.8 and 3.6 μM of
ADA (total ADA amount: 0.9 and 1.8 nmol, respectively) were added
to the cells containing AuNP-CB[7] complexes. We used the intensity
ratios of all the supramolecular complex ions (C and DC ions) and
all the ligand related ions (L, D, C, and DC ions) to evaluate the
ADA-triggered dissociation of the complexes. All the ion intensity
ratios were then normalized (Figure 5b) relative
to cells without ADA treatment. The decrease in the normalized ion
intensity ratios show the dissociation of these three supramolecular
complexes is different. A more detailed examination using one-way
ANOVA reveals that AuNP 3-CB[7] complexes are much more
stable to ADA treatment than the other two ligands. This observation
of selectivity illustrates the utility of the of the LDI/MALDI-MS
method to screen multiple host–guest interactions in cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the use of LDI/MALDI-MS to detect
AuNP-CB[7] complexes in cells, confirming that both formation and
dissociation of host–guest interactions inside cells can be
monitored. We predict that this method is adaptable for monitoring
other host–guest systems with various types of NPs,30 with the inherent multiplex capabilities of
the mass barcode approach facilitating high-throughput screening.
