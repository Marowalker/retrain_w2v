Natural products profoundly impact many research areas,
including
medicine, organic chemistry, and cell biology. However, discovery
of new natural products suffers from a lack of high throughput analytical
techniques capable of identifying structural novelty in the face of
a high degree of chemical redundancy. Methods to select bacterial
strains for drug discovery have historically been based on phenotypic
qualities or genetic differences and have not been based on laboratory
production of secondary metabolites. Therefore, untargeted LC/MS-based
secondary metabolomics was evaluated to rapidly and efficiently analyze
marine-derived bacterial natural products using LC/MS-principal component
analysis (PCA). A major goal of this work was to demonstrate that
LC/MS-PCA was effective for strain prioritization in a drug discovery
program. As proof of concept, we evaluated LC/MS-PCA for strain selection
to support drug discovery, for the discovery of unique natural products,
and for rapid assessment of regulation of natural product production.

==== Body
Natural products are genetically
encoded small molecules that have had a profound impact on many research
areas including medicine, organic chemistry, and cell biology.1 Between 1981 and 2010, natural products or their
derivatives accounted for 74% and 59% of antibacterial and anticancer
new chemical entities (NCEs), respectively;2 natural products remain an important source for drug discovery3 and continue to inspire synthetic organic chemistry
with their superlative architectural complexity.4 Natural products have also made important contributions
to cell biology due to their outstanding potency and specificity.
For example, rapamycin helped elucidate the many complexities of mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling.5

While bacterially produced natural products continue to be
an important
source for therapeutic discovery, finding novel natural products has
become more difficult, and new methods are greatly needed. Genomics-based
methods, such as genome mining6 and metagenomics,7,8 hold great promise for discovery of novel natural products and new
biosynthetic pathways but, at present, are difficult to integrate
with contemporary targeted high-throughput screening (HTS).1,9,10 With respect to culture-dependent
methods, immense bacterial and chemical diversity remains undiscovered.11 Whole genome sequencing of bacteria and fungi
has demonstrated that only a small fraction of the “parvome”
has been discovered.12,13 In particular, the marine environment
contains a wealth of undiscovered bacteria and bacterial natural products.14 We have focused on actinomycetes from underexplored
niches, marine invertebrates such as sponges and ascidians, as a source
of bacterial diversity and chemical diversity for drug discovery.

With respect to drug discovery, analytical technology development
has greatly assisted with building fractionated natural product libraries
that are compatible with HTS.15,16 The success of HTS
is inherently dependent on chemical diversity and a lack of chemical
redundancy.3,17 Historically, natural product extract sources
were chosen either randomly or on the basis of their ecology and/or
taxonomy. For bacteria chemical diversity was not determined prior
to extraction, leading to redundant strains and compounds in many
natural product extract libraries.18 In
order to overcome this historical weakness that led to high rates
of rediscovery, methods based on the genetic potential of a microorganism
to produce natural products were used.19,20 Importantly,
cultivated strains may appear identical, but produce different secondary
metabolites.21 Alternatively, strains that
appear different by morphology and 16S sequencing could produce the
same secondary metabolites. Therefore, we hypothesized that a chemoinformatics
method based on secondary metabolite production in the lab would be
more valuable and would greatly increase the value of a screening
library for HTS. We embraced methods from metabolomics since they
were designed, in part, to analyze large numbers of compounds without
complete knowledge of the structure.

Metabolomics is the global
measurement of the small molecule metabolites
in a biological system and reflects the phenotype of (and is therefore
complementary to) its underlying genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic
networks. Metabolomics research typically implements analytical tools
such as LC/MS to globally measure small molecule metabolites.22−25 Combining principal component analysis (PCA) with LC/MS is an attractive
method to provide a visual representation of variance between LC/MS
profiles. We hypothesized that bacterial strains producing the same
secondary metabolites would group together, whereas those producing
different metabolites would be separated, thereby providing a method
to select bacteria having distinct chemistries without having to identify
each component of their corresponding extracts. A major distinction
between the work presented here and other metabolomics studies is
that we focused on secondary metabolites rather than primary metabolites.

The goal of this study was to evaluate LC/MS-PCA based secondary
metabolomics to more broadly investigate secondary metabolites from
marine invertebrate-associated bacteria to assist with strain selection/dereplication
to support drug discovery efforts, to distinguish taxonomically identical
species, to discover new natural products, and to study regulation
of secondary metabolite production. Compared with conventional manual
comparison among LC/MS traces, PCA significantly increased the efficiency
of these studies (Figure 1).

Ascidian Collection and Bacterial Cultivation
See Supporting Information.

Sample Preparation for UHPLC/HRESI-TOF-MS
Procedure for Fermentations
An aliquot (1.5 mL) of
each fermentation was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube
(1.7 mL) and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant
(1 mL) was transferred into a clean vial and placed on a Gilson GX-271
liquid handling system. The supernatant was subjected to automated
SPE (Biotage: EVOLUTE ABN, 25 mg absorbent mass, 1 mL reservoir volume),
washed using H2O (1 mL) to remove media components/primary
metabolites, and eluted with MeOH (1 mL) directly into an LC/MS-certified
vial. While removal of primary metabolites by SPE cannot be guaranteed,
we have not observed primary metabolites in our analyses to date.
All compounds that have been observed as affecting the PCA have been
secondary metabolites. EVOLUTE ABN was selected because it was optimized
as a phase to concentrate drug-like compounds. Two biological replicates
were prepared for each bacterial strain.

Procedure for Agar-Based Solid Media
For Streptomyces spp., we sampled directly off solid agar media. Two cores (8 mm
diameter) of bacteria and agar were obtained from each plate, placed
directly into MeOH (2 mL), and extracted for 30 min. The extract was
transferred into a clean vial and evaporated using a SpeedVac concentrator;
the residue was dissolved in MeOH (100 μL), followed by addition
of H2O (1 mL). The solution was then placed on a Gilson
GX-271 liquid handling system and subjected to automated SPE as described
above.

UHPLC/HRMS Analysis
LC/MS data were acquired using
a Bruker MaXis ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometer coupled with a Waters Acquity
UPLC system operated by Bruker Hystar software. A Phenomenex 2.6 μm
core–shell column was selected because it provides comparable
results to fully porous sub-2-μm particles while generating
much lower back pressure at the same velocity. Therefore, the core–shell
particles can be used not only on a UHPLC system but also on a standard
HPLC system.26−28 A gradient of MeOH and H2O (containing
0.1% formic acid) was employed with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min on an
RP C-18 column (Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 100
mm). The gradient started from MeOH/H2O (10%/90%), followed
by a linear gradient to reach MeOH/H2O (97%/3%) in 12 min,
and held for 2 min at MeOH/H2O (97%/3%). Full scan mass
spectra (m/z 150–1550) were
measured in positive ESI mode. MS data were acquired under (+)-ESI
based on experience and a recent paper,29 where 93% of the tested 719 microbial natural product and mycotoxin
reference standards were detected using (+)-ESI positive mode. The
mass spectrometer was operated using the following parameters: capillary,
4.5 kV; nebulizer pressure, 4.0 bar; dry gas flow, 6.0 L/min; dry
gas temperature, 200 °C; scan rate, 2 Hz. Tune mix (Agilent,
ESI-L low concentration) was introduced through a divert valve at
the end of each chromatographic run for automatic internal calibration.
Data-dependent MS/MS data were acquired using the following additional
parameters: number of precursors, 3; absolute threshold, 2000; summation
factor, 1.0×. Isolation width and collision energy were applied
on the basis of isolation mass value and charge state against a table
of isolation and fragmentation lists (see Table S1 in Supporting Information).

Data Processing and PCA
Bruker Data Analysis 4.0 was
used for analysis of chromatograms. Molecular formulas were predicted
using Bruker SmartFormula algorithm, which uses both exact mass and
isotopic patterns.30 Bucketing LC/MS data
and PCA was performed using Bruker ProfileAnalysis 2.0. The detailed
parameters for advanced bucketing and PCA can be found in the Additional
Experimental Section in the Supporting Information. Freely available software packages, such as XCMS31 and MZMine,32 can also be used
for raw LCMS data preprocessing to generate feature tables, which
can be used for PCA in software, such as SIMCA, MATLAB, and freely
available packages for R. We compared using XCMS in combination with
PCA analysis with R to confirm that results were similar. Compared
with open-source software, Profile Analysis 2.0 provides dynamically
linked scores plot, loadings plot, and bucket statistics plot, which
is convenient and efficient for data mining.

Results and Discussion
Data Preprocessing and PCA
In Profile Analysis 2.0,
a molecule feature finding algorithm was employed to extract compound
signals from background noise.31 Advanced
bucketing applied an internal hierarchical clustering algorithm to
construct buckets with given sizes of retention time (RT) and m/z around picked compounds followed by
generation of a bucket table including RT–m/z pairs (buckets) and intensities. Importantly,
the size of the retention time window must be greater than the possible
retention time variation between runs. Compounds with different charge
states were deconvoluted into a single RT–m/z pair (bucket).33 Both
line and profile spectra were subjected to PCA and showed identical
results. Thus, line spectra were selected, which significantly reduced
calculation time. The bucket table was then subjected to PCA, and
the scores plots and the corresponding loadings plots were analyzed
using Profile Analysis 2.0. Profile Analysis greatly assisted with
analyzing PCA results. For example, the scores plot presents a view
of the variance in the data, and the further groups separate, the
more different the secondary metabolites. The loadings plot is geometrically
related to the scores plot and described the variance observed in
the scores plot. Analysis of any point in the loadings plot through
selection with a mouse provides a corresponding bucket statistics
plot that shows the intensity of the selected compound in all analyses
that were used for PCA. Additionally, a dynamically linked table highlights
the compound selected in the loadings plot. The table contains the m/z–RT information, intensity, and
the accurate mass, which allows a quick analysis of putative molecular
formulas using SmartFormula. The ability to interactively analyze
secondary metabolites greatly assisted these studies and will be highlighted
below.

Strain Selection by Secondary Metabolomics
Without
careful construction of a screening library, large screening campaigns
lead to identifying large numbers of known compounds. Therefore, an
effective strain selection approach is required to maximize chemical
diversity and minimize redundancy for discovery of therapeutic leads.34,35 As a proof of concept for strain selection, 47 strains (32 Verrucosispora spp., 5 Micromonospora spp.,
and 10 Nocardia spp. cultivated from tropical ascidians, Trididemnum orbiculatum, Didemnum psammathode, and Ecteinascidia turbinata) were analyzed by
LC/MS and PCA. (See Table S1 in Supporting Information for more details on the strains.) The LC/MS data used for this research
has been made publicly accessible.36 The Verrucosispora spp. and Micromonospora spp.
appeared identical on isolation plates and provided a real world example
of distinguishing strains cultivated from marine invertebrates. In
some cases these bacteria were identical by morphology and 16S rDNA
sequences. After LC/MS and processing, a total of 26 027 buckets
and 74 principal components were generated and explained 98% of the
variation in the data set. Analysis of the resulting scores plot (PC1
versus PC2) showed identifiable groups. As stated in the Experimental Section, the loadings plot was dynamically linked
to the scores plot to facilitate identification of compounds that
caused variance. After analysis of the scores plot, 7 clustered groups
were identified (Figure 2a). To address the
question of whether selection by PCA resulted in low chemical redundancy,
we selected one representative strain from each of the 7 clustered
groups and generated a heat map (Figure 2b).
The heat map of metabolite profiles showed little overlap and complementary
chemical space based on detected ions. Overall, this would greatly
reduce chemical redundancy in a screening library when strains were
selected on the basis of PCA.

We also compared and contrasted
the use of secondary metabolomics with phylogenetic trees generated
from 16S rDNA sequences (Figure 2c). In some
cases, the grouping observed in the PCA scores plot (Figure 2a) paralleled those observed in the phylogenetic
tree. For example, the G1 and G3 groups were dominated by Verrucosispora spp. On the other hand, Verrucosispora spp. found in both G1 and G3 had identical 16S sequences indicating
that PCA provided finer resolution to distinguish strains compared
to morphology and 16S comparisons. The results indicated that strains
with nearly identical 16S gene sequences do not necessarily produce
the same natural products and supported our approach for strain selection
based on natural product production. These results are consistent
with other published results where strains that appear nearly identical
by morphology and 16S rDNA sequences (>99% identity) can produce
different
natural products.21 LC/MS-PCA proved useful
for distinguishing strains on the basis of laboratory production of
secondary metabolites. With respect to strain dereplication, LC/MS-PCA
could provide a selection criterion prior to 16S sequencing to reduce
the number of bacteria that need to be sequenced in a drug discovery
program.

A limiting factor to using PCA was that supporting
approaches were
necessary to increase the scale. For example, PCA would not be useful
for analyzing 1000 strains at a time. We have found that analysis
of between 20 and 50 strains was practical. For strain selection from
a cultivated collection, we use a combination of gross morphology
and source organism to classify groups to be analyzed by PCA. Additionally,
analysis can be performed on overlapping groups such that each successive
analysis contains some data from the previous analysis. Combined with
gross morphology, we have now successfully analyzed over 500 strains
with great success.

Information). Strains, designated by color and shape, were

in colored circles. (b) A heat map to display distinct metabolic profiles

Each group of strains was designated by a colored circle in the PCA
scores plot; strains within each circle were matched to the same color
in the phylogenetic tree. WMMB-328 is a Streptomyces sp. and was used as an outgroup.

Discovery of Natural Products Unique to Specific Strains
Previous work showed that natural products produced by Myxococcus spp. could be rapidly mapped to producing strains and novel natural
products could be identified using secondary metabolomics.33,37 Therefore, we evaluated the process for marine invertebrate associated
bacteria. The loadings plot was used to identify compounds that caused
a clustered group to separate. Again, Profile Analysis allowed a point
and click in the loadings plot to observe the presence of the compound
in all analyzed strains. Additionally, an accurate mass was obtained
through the dynamically linked table. For selected putative new natural
products, isolation and structure elucidation of those compounds was
undertaken as described in Supporting Information. In addition to conventional approaches, an LC-MS-SPE-NMR system38 was used in conjunction with 1H{13C,15N} 1.7 mm NMR cryogenic probe to facilitate
rapid structure elucidation.

As an example, compound 1 (RT 5.5 min-m/z 600.7804, [M +
2H]2+) (Figure 3b) was a significant
contributor to group 7 (Figure 3a) because 1 and group 7 were located in the same quadrant in the loadings
plot and the scores plot, respectively. From the bucket statistics
plot (Figure 3c), compound 1 was
only detected in the strains from group 7, which consisted of Nocardia spp. along with two Micromonospora spp. After rapid structure dereplication based on high resolution
MS data of 1 (Figure 3), compound 1 was a new natural product that has been targeted for structure
determination but was beyond the scope of this work.

products unique to the group 7. (a) PCA scores
plot (PC1 vs PC2) of the 47 stains (Table S1 in
Supporting Information). (b) PCA loadings plot. The PCA loadings
plot is geometrically related to the scores plot and can be used to
identify the compounds responsible for group patterns in the PCA scores
plot. Compound 1 (RT 5.5 min m/z 600.7804, [M + 2H]2+) is one of the major contributors
to group 7. (c) The bucket statistic plot for 1 showing
normalized intensities of 1 in the 47 strains. Compound 1 was only detected in group 7.

Identifying compounds responsible for groups near
the center of
the scores plot, such as group 4 (Strain WMMB-247, Figure 3a), was not straightforward. However, observing
different PC planes could separate these groups. As shown in Figure 4a, WMMB-247 was separated in the PC1 vs PC4 plane.
Compounds unique to WMMB-247 were identified in the corresponding
loadings plot (Figure 4b). The major compounds
unique to WMMB-247 were elucidated as two rare phenylacetyl-desferrioxamines
(2–3) (Figure 4c). The structures of 2 and 3 were confirmed
using MS/MS and NMR (Figures S3 and S4).
The bucket statistics plot for compound 2 (RT 7.4 min m/z 679.4026, [M + H]+) indicated
that the compound was only detected in strain WMMB-247 (Figure 4d). Desferrioxamines 2 and 3 were recently reported and promoted the growth of previously uncultivable
bacteria when released from neighboring strains.39

statistic plot of 2 (RT 7.4 min m/z 679.4026, [M + H]+). As shown, compound 2 was only detected in WMMB-247.

Having success with strains grown in liquid, we
tested LC/MS-PCA
to discover novel natural products from marine-derived Streptomyces spp. grown on solid media. Fifty-three marine-derived Streptomyces spp. cultivated from tropical ascidians, Trididemnum orbiculatum and Didemnum psammathode, were analyzed using LC/MS-PCA
(Figure 5). In the scores plot, strain WMMB-272
was clearly distinct from the other strains, which indicated unique
natural products. Molecular formulas were identified through interactive
analysis of the loadings plot, and searches in databases indicated
that the compounds responsible for the variance observed in PCA were
new natural products. Subsequently, we purified the compounds, elucidated
their structures, and determined that they were novel natural products
(see 1D and 2D NMR assignment in Table S2, Figure
S5–S8). Although 4 and 5 were
published by Fenical and co-workers40 during
the preparation of this paper, we independently discovered them using
PCA. Compound 6 was a new natural product, and this is
the first report of the structure. In addition, we identified 20 out
of the 53 Streptomyces spp. isolates produced a number
of unique and putative new natural products. The isolation and structure
elucidation of these compounds will be reported in due course. Compared
to traditional approaches, this method represented a remarkably high
discovery rate from Streptomyces spp.

(4–6) were determined by NMR and

class of polyenepyrones.

Assessment of Microbial Natural Product Production by Secondary
Metabolomics
Secondary metabolomics was also evaluated as
a method to assess natural product production. We hypothesized that
LC/MS-PCA would be a valuable tool to investigate regulation of biosynthesis.
Therefore, we selected a system where regulation was well understood,
desferrioxamine (iron siderophores) production and regulation. Bacteria
have developed sophisticated mechanisms to regulate iron metabolism,
which have been extensively investigated.41 A marine-derived Micromonospora sp. (WMMB-224)
was selected because it produced a diverse group of desferrioxamine.
Since desferrioxamine biosynthesis was shown to be highly responsive
to iron concentrations, the effects of iron in three growth media
(ASW-A, ASW-K, and DI-A) (see recipe in Table
S3 in Supporting Information) on desferrioxamine production
was investigated. Using LC/MS-PCA, a total of 30 conditions (Table S4 in Supporting Information) were simultaneously
analyzed. The grouping pattern in the PCA scores plot was primarily
based on the concentrations of iron added and not on the type of iron
added or the three media types (Figures S1a and
S2a,b in Supporting Information). After examining the loadings
plot (Figure S1b), a major difference between
group 1 and group 3 was the absence and presence of compound 7 (putative new natural product RT 10.5 min m/z 431.2767, [M + H]+), respectively.
As predicted, the other major difference between group 1 and group
3 was primarily due to the presence and absence of desferrioxamines,
respectively. However, desferrioxamine B (8) and desferrioxamine
D1 (9) in group 1 were observed as Fe3+-chelated
forms in group 3 (Figure S1b). This proof
of concept suggests that LC/MS-PCA would be a valuable tool for analyzing
regulation of biosynthesis.

In conclusion, LC/MS-PCA (“secondary
metabolomics”) was effective for selecting strains to yield
the most chemically diverse and novel natural products for drug discovery.
Importantly, we showed that chemistry did not always correlate with
16S phylogenetic trees, and those differences could easily be observed
using PCA. Overall, analysis of secondary metabolites provided finer
resolution of strain differentiation than 16S. Additionally, heat
maps indicated that little chemical redundancy was observed when selecting
representative strains for drug discovery. In the end, we have validated
LC/MS-PCA as a rapid method to select strains on the basis of laboratory
production of secondary metabolites. In addition to strain selection,
secondary metabolomics greatly assisted with discovery of novel natural
products and will be a useful tool to study regulation of natural
product biosynthesis. Overall, these methods could enable a wide range
of studies in the field of microbial natural products by drastically
decreasing analysis time compared to manual comparison of LC/MS chromatograms.
