We
present a new methodology for efficient and high-quality patterning
of biological reagents for surface-based biological assays. The method
relies on hydrodynamically confined nanoliter volumes of reagents
to interact with the substrate at the micrometer-length scale. We
study the interplay between diffusion, advection, and surface chemistry
and present the design of a noncontact scanning microfluidic device
to efficiently present reagents on surfaces. By leveraging convective
flows, recirculation, and mixing of a processing liquid, this device
overcomes limitations of existing biopatterning approaches, such as
passive diffusion of analytes, uncontrolled wetting, and drying artifacts.
We demonstrate the deposition of analytes, showing a 2- to 5-fold
increase in deposition rate together with a 10-fold reduction in analyte
consumption while ensuring less than 6% variation in pattern homogeneity
on a standard biological substrate. In addition, we demonstrate the
recirculation of a processing liquid using a microfluidic probe (MFP)
in the context of a surface assay for (i) probing 12 independent areas
with a single microliter of processing liquid and (ii) processing
a 2 mm2 surface to create 170 antibody spots of 50 ×
100 μm2 area using 1.6 μL of liquid. We observe
high pattern quality, conservative usage of reagents, micrometer precision
of localization and convection-enhanced fast deposition. Such a device
and method may facilitate quantitative biological assays and spur
the development of the next generation of protein microarrays.

==== Body
Patterning
and immobilization
of chemicals, proteins, or biomolecules on surfaces are central to
surface biological assays1−5 and have applications in cell–substrate studies, cell microenvironment
modulation, chemical gradients on surfaces for motility assays, protein–protein
interaction studies, creation of diverse libraries for drug screening
and toxicology studies, screening of multiple biomarkers in point-of-care
personalized medicine, for example. Established biopatterning methods
locally deposit analytes using minute volumes (picoliter to microliter)
of reagents and can broadly be classified into two categories. The
first one uses inkjet technologies, where nanoliter volumes are spotted
onto surfaces.6−8 The second category requires a gentle contact between
a pin and a substrate9 to transfer a small
volume of processing liquid onto a surface. Both approaches (Figure 1a) are widespread
in research laboratories and industrial facilities as they enable
high-throughput processing and precise (nanometer to micrometer accuracy)
deposition10,11 of biochemicals. However, these
approaches are limited by uncontrolled wetting and evaporation,12 which affect the homogeneity and repeatability
of deposition.6,13 More generally, to abate evaporation,
oil has been used as an immersion liquid,14 but in the context of biopatterning, the surface requires a rigorous
wash step to remove the oil prior to downstream analytical tests.
Such rinsing involves solvents and surfactants that will likely cause
degradation of the patterned receptors. In contrast, several research
groups developed microfluidic-based biopatterning techniques focusing
on deposition quality15 in which closed
channels prevent evaporation. For example, Delamarche et al. developed
microfluidic networks (MFN, Figure 1c) to deliver proteins to surfaces by placing and sealing
elastomeric materials on the substrate16 and, a variant thereof, a stencil-based method17 to spatially localize the processing liquid on surfaces
(Figure 1b). These
microfluidic methods resulted in high-quality biopatterns confined
to specific areas on a surface but suffered from either a large volume
consumption or a low deposition rate. Moreover, MFNs are not compatible
with high-density discrete unit patterns, such as microarrays, and
any variations of the pattern would need a redesign of the network.
Other examples of contact-based microfluidic implementations, such
as chemistrodes,18 fountain pens,19,20 and continuous-flow printing,21 also
impose constraints on the type of surface and the ability to scan
and are subject to cross-contamination as well. Noncontact implementations
using electric fields, such as electrohydrodynamic jet printing22 and scanning ion-conductance microscopy,23 demonstrated patterns in the hundreds of nanometers
range with large inter- and intraspot variations24 but require conductive substrates.

methods. (a) Pin-spotter and inkjet deposit

structures that are physically placed on a substrate to localize the
processing liquid with micrometer precision. The simulation shows

networks (MFN) use convection-enhanced deposition to decrease deposition

the diffusion profile along the flow path. (d) Using a pump to recirculate

(f) The ideal implementation of biopatterning takes advantage of convection-enhanced
deposition, high-resolution scanning, recirculation, and mixing while
ensuring a localized, noncontact deposition. (g) Empirical graph highlighting
six important attributes of biopatterning methods.

Thus, versatile and high-quality patterning of
biochemicals on
surfaces remains elusive, but microfluidic implementations have paved
the way toward convection-enhanced deposition. In general, continuous-flow
methods (Figure 1c–f)
result in a reduction of the deposition time compared with diffusion-driven
processes25 but are very inefficient in
terms of reagent consumption for two key reasons. First, continuous
flow implies the use of larger volumes than in diffusion-based deposition,
and second, the actual usage of analytes from the solution is very
low. For example, a typical convection-based surface reaction in a
100-μm-deep channel would consume less than 1.5% of the sample
flowing over the surface, resulting in tremendous waste of analytes
(see section SI-1 in the Supporting Information).
This inefficient reagent usage is problematic, particularly in biopatterning,
where biochemicals such as antibodies and DNA probes are expensive.
Circulating the processing liquid multiple times over the deposition
zone (Figure 1d) provides
a way to improve reagent utilization.26,27 In microchannels,
however, laminar flows will hinder homogenization of the recirculated
volume, and mixing would therefore be necessary to enable a more efficient
usage of the processing liquid (Figure 1e).28,29 With this in mind, we envision
six attributes for an ideal implementation of a versatile biopatterning
device (Figure 1g):
low reagent consumption, high deposition rate, efficient reagent usage,
low variation in the spots deposited, high throughput, and micrometer-scale
precision in deposition. Such a device should leverage continuous
flow deposition together with mixing and recirculation of the processing
liquid (Figure 1f).
On the one hand, this ideal implementation would retain the advantages
of inkjet and pin-spotting devices, namely, low reagent consumption,
high throughput, and precise localization. On the other hand, processing
of the surface with continuous flows would provide efficient use of
analytes, reduced deposition time, and homogeneity of the pattern
deposited.

In this paper, we report a scanning, noncontact microfluidic
device
for high-quality, versatile biopatterning. This approach makes use
of a vertically oriented microfluidic probe (MFP)30,31 to confine nanoliter volumes of processing liquid on top of a substrate
in a wet environment, ensuring noncontact operation and convection-enhanced
deposition. MFPs belong to a class of devices termed “open-space
microfluidics” that relies on hydrodynamic flow confinement
(HFC) of the liquid.32 Here, we leveraged
hierarchical HFC33 to dilute the aspirated
processing liquid minimally and show that biochemicals can be efficiently
recirculated back and forth on a surface. We developed analytical
models to investigate diffusion, advection, and surface reactions
in the context of HFC and, with this, defined the MFP operational
parameters for efficient biopatterning (see section SI-2 in the Supporting Information). We demonstrate the deposition
of analytes in the context of the deposition and detection of IgG,
showing a 2- to 5-fold increase in deposition rate together with a
10-fold reduction in analyte consumption while ensuring less than
6% variation in pattern homogeneity on a standard biological substrate.
IgG antibodies are macromolecules of about 150 kDa and play a key
role in the immune system as they react with receptors present on
the surfaces of macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells.
They are used as a diagnostic marker for several autoimmune diseases
and as a measure of the immune response to pathogens, for example,
the serologic immunity to measure measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis
B, varicella. IgGs extracted from donated plasma are also used in
therapy to treat immune deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, and infections.34

In addition, we demonstrate recirculation
of a processing liquid
using the MFP in the context of a surface assay: (i) for probing 12
independent areas with a single microliter of processing liquid, which
is relevant when multiple assays have to be performed with a limited
volume budget, and (ii) for processing a 2 mm2 surface
to create 170 antibody spots of 50 × 100 μm2 area using 1.6 μL of liquid.

For efficient usage of
the processing liquid, we circulate this
liquid back and forth while ensuring homogenization through mixing
in the serpentine channels of the MFP head.29 The implementation of this circulation in the device has two states,
in which the direction of flow is different. In state 1, the liquid
is injected via the two apertures on the right and aspirated through
the two apertures on the left (see Figure 2a). After switching to state 2, all flow
directions of the liquids are inverted. Such liquid switching would
typically be performed with 2-position valves, but they generally
have a large dead volume (tens of microliters) and involve a displacement
of the liquid that would disrupt the HFC temporarily. To address these
two important issues, we developed a low-dead-volume fluidic system
in which the liquid reservoirs are placed close to the MFP head (see Figure 2b). We used the valves
to redirect positive and negative pressures toward the appropriate
reservoirs. The advantages of using valves to switch the pressure
instead of liquids are (i) the absence of liquid displacement in the
HFC when switching, (ii) valves can be placed away from the microfluidic
system without increasing dead volumes, and (iii) switching is fast
(within few milliseconds), with the pressure stabilizing within 1
s. Flow rates are generated using external pressure controllers and
hydrodynamic resistors (see Figure 2) integrated in the MFP head and monitored in real-time.

Figure 2 Scheme
for liquid recirculation using pressure switching. (a) Hierarchical
flow confinement is generated in state 1 to ensure minimal dilution
of the processing liquid. When switching the valves to state 2, the
direction of the flows is reversed. (b) Scheme of low-dead-volume
pressure switching for liquid recirculation.

Theory
Diffusive Transport between Two Laminar Flows within the HFC
In a single HFC, dilution of the processing liquid is driven primarily
by its aspiration together with the surrounding liquid. In the hierarchical
HFC, because Qi1 = |Qa2|, dilution is solely due
to diffusion of analytes from the processing liquid to the shaping
liquid and is therefore limited. For efficient recirculation of the
processing liquid, this loss of analyte should be minimized. We developed
a model to investigate the dilution γ of the processing liquid
as a function of two key parameters, namely, the apex-to-surface distance d and the flow rate of the processing liquid Qi1 (see Figure 3a,b).

Figure 3 Scheme for analytical model of analyte
transport in a hierarchical
HFC. (a) Bottom view of a hierarchical HFC with corresponding coordinate
system. (b) Schematic side view of a hierarchical HFC.

The apex of the MFP head and the surface to be
processed are considered
as two parallel surfaces, with an apex-to-surface distance ranging
from 10 to 50 μm. Given these boundary conditions, we apply
the Hele–Shaw approximation and model the liquid flow between
apex and surface as a potential flow (see section SI-3 in the Supporting Information). Each of the four apertures
creates a static, radial velocity field of liquid flow. The resulting
velocity field represents the superimposition of the radial velocity
fields from the individual apertures. Because the resulting velocity
field is symmetric, transport across the interface can be described
by considering only one-half of the interface. We define a curvilinear
coordinate system, with χ the coordinate axis tangential to
the interface and ρ the coordinate axis perpendicular to the
interface (see Figure 3a). The analyte in the processing liquid has a diffusion coefficient D, and the initial analyte concentrations are c0 and c = 0 for the processing liquid
and the shaping liquid, respectively. The initial concentration profile c(χ = 0, ρ) across the interface can thus be
approximated with a Heaviside step function.

The dilution γ
is expressed as the ratio of the rate with
which analytes diffuse from the processing liquid into the shaping
liquid to the total rate of analytes transported through the confined
liquids: 1  

Theoretical values for γ and
the development of equations
are presented and compared with experimental dilution values in section SI-3 in the Supporting Information.

According to both analytical and experimental dilution values,
efficient recirculation is favored at higher flow rates and when the
head is in close proximity of the surface. We note however that the
flow rate will influence the amount of processing liquid used per
circulation cycle. This implies that for a finite volume of processing
liquid, there is a trade-off between the flow rate of the processing
liquid and the number of circulation cycles per minute. Depending
on the application, parameters such as apex-to-surface distance and
flow rates need to be adjusted to ensure proper surface processing
and minimal loss of processing liquid.

Convective Transport and
Deposition of Analytes on a Surface
This model describes
a metric ε(t) that
quantifies the benefit of convective transport as compared to diffusion-driven
transport for surface biopatterning. While it is clearly established25 that convection will enhance the deposition
rate, this gain largely depends on the working regime and parameters
such as analyte concentration in the processing liquid, flow rates,
and surface processing duration. We developed an analytical model
that describes convection-enhanced deposition of analytes on a surface
using the hierarchical HFC. This model accounts for the transport
of IgG molecules from the HFC to the surface and for the kinetics
of the reaction between analytes and receptors on the surface.

We investigate the deposition of an analyte with a diffusion coefficient DA and a concentration c0 on a surface presenting binding sites with a surface density bm. Binding of analytes is assumed to follow
first-order Langmuir kinetics and can therefore be characterized with
the association and dissociation constants kon and koff. Because of the binding
of analytes to receptors on the surface, the concentration of analytes
in the processing liquid directly above the surface reduces, and a
depletion zone is formed. Despite strong advective transport, analytes
can travel across the depletion zone only by means of diffusion. For
operation of the MFP, this depletion zone is steady and on the order
of a tenth of a micrometer, which is small relative to the apex-to-surface
distance and to the HFC footprint, which is typically 50 × 100 μm2. We apply models for transport through a thin depletion zone
and first-order binding of analytes to a surface as summarized by
Squires et al.25 Central to this analysis
is a Damköhler number Da defined as the ratio
of the rate of reaction at the surface to the rate of convective transport
of analytes. 2  In eq 2, N is Avogardo’s number and  is the nondimensionalized
flux of analytes
through the depletion zone.35 For MFP-based
deposition of an IgG, the binding of analytes to the surface is neither
transport nor reaction limited, because Da is in
the range of 1 (see section SI-4 in the
Supporting Information). The ratio ε(t) of
analyte bound with the MFP to that of pipet deposition can be evaluated
as (see section SI-4 in the Supporting
Information): 3  Here ε(t)
expresses
the ratio of MFP-deposited IgG to pipet-deposited IgG as a function
of time. This metric quantifies the benefit of convective transport
when compared with diffusion-driven surface patterning. Figure 4a shows ε(t) for four concentrations of IgG in the processing liquid, with standard
parameters for MFP surface processing. The graph suggests that deposition
using the MFP is more efficient for times shorter than 10 min and
strongly depends on the analyte concentration. Once saturation of
the surface with the MFP has been reached, the pipet deposition efficiency
will slowly converge to the MFP-based deposition efficiency, thus
ε(t) converges to 1. Interestingly, the lower
the concentration, the better the MFP will perform in comparison to
pipet deposition, which implies that convective deposition is particularly
favorable for low concentrations. As an example, for a concentration
of 50 μg/mL, the amount of analyte deposited with the MFP after
40 s will be 1.5-fold higher than with pipet deposition. Longer deposition
times will result in identical deposition efficiencies for both approaches
after 6 min. In contrast, for a 10-fold lower concentration (5 μg/mL),
the number of analytes deposited with the MFP after 5 min will be
3.5-fold higher than with pipet deposition. The pipet deposition will
require more than an hour to reach the MFP-based deposition efficiency.
This analysis clearly highlights the advantage of using MFP deposition
for low concentrations of analyte and also that there is an optimal
range of processing durations in which the MFP is particularly relevant.

Figure 4 Deposition
efficiency using the MFP with different concentration
of reagents. (a) Ratio of deposited analytes with the MFP compared
with pipet-based deposition for concentrations of 5, 20, 35, and 50
μg/mL. (b) Ratio of analytes deposited over the total amount
of analytes in the processing volume. Both values were calculated
numerically for four concentrations of an IgG molecule.

From this model, we also derived the analyte usage
as a function
of time (see Figure 4b), which corresponds to the ratio of analytes bound to the surface
to the initial number of analytes in the processing liquid. Consequently,
analyte usage is first marked by a strong increase in the number of
bound analytes, and we term this the deposition regime. The decrease
of available free binding sites on the surface over time leads to
a reduction of the association rate, and analyte usage enters a plateau
regime when the association rate and the dissociation rate balance
each other. Through successive dilution of the processing liquid in
every circulation cycle, the concentration of analytes decreases to
the extent that dissociation of analytes from the surface becomes
predominant in the desorption regime. The model allows us to estimate
the number of recirculation cycles (or time) after which the processing
liquid is depleted because of deposition on the surface and diffusive
transport to the outer flow confinement. The processing liquid can
then be replenished before entering the “desorption phase”,
thus preventing deposition issues. Figure 4b further implies that analyte usage depends
on the initial concentration and remains below 6% for the four concentrations
investigated. An important implication of this result is that a unit
volume of processing liquid can be circulated multiple times for multispot
deposition or for long incubation times.

Materials and Methods
Microfluidic
Probe Platform
The MFP platform consists
of three linear stages (Lang GmbH, Hüttenberg, Germany) for
the positioning of the head relative to the surface. The sample is
placed on a custom arm of the stages that is placed above an inverted
microscope (Eclipse TI-E, Nikon, Japan). The head can be positioned
on the surface with an accuracy of 100 nm. Images were acquired using
an ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan)
and using LED lamp illumination (Sola, Lumencore Inc., Beaverton,
OR). The MFP head is mounted on a holder vertical to the microscope
objective and aligned to the surface using manual rotation stages.
A detailed description of the setup, alignment procedure, and standard
operation of the MFP head can be found elsewhere.33

Setup to Implement Liquid Recirculation
Four independent
reservoirs were connected to the MFP head using 1/16 PEEK tubing (IDEX
H&S, Oak Harbor, WA) and linear connectors (Dolomite Microfluidics,
Charlestown, MA). The reservoirs were pressurized using pressure control
devices (MFCS, Fluigent, Paris, France) with a working range of ±200
mbar per channel. Pressure was switched in the four reservoirs simultaneously
using two-way switch valves (2-switch, Fluigent, Paris, France). Pressures
would typically stabilize within hundreds of milliseconds, resulting
in the stabilization of the flow confinement within one second. Flow
rates were measured using flow sensors (Fluigent, Paris, France).
Hydrodynamic resistances in the MFP head were designed to provide
a suitable working range of pressures to generate the flows.

MFP Head
Microfabrication
The MFP head is a microfabricated
silicon-glass device. The head comprises four apertures, hydrodynamic
resistors, and two storage and mixing zones of 1 μL volume for
circulation of the processing liquid. Channels (50 μm ×
50 μm) in silicon were defined photolithographically and etched
using deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). Subsequently, they were sealed
by anodic bonding (1.3 kV, 475 °C) with glass. The fabrication
process has been described in detail elsewhere.31

Measuring the concentration of processing
liquid
We
used a solution of 50 μM Rhodamine B as the reference for concentration
measurements. The fluorescence intensity of the flow confinement was
acquired using a camera. We measured the average fluorescence value
on a region of interest (ROI). To obtain the relative drop in concentration
after each circulation cycle, the same ROI was used to measure the
fluorescence of the confined solution. For measurements requiring
precise apex-to-surface distance control, we performed a z-axis reference to zero height prior to each experiment.

Rabbit IgG
Antibody–Antigen Assay
A test surface
was prepared starting with a clean polystyrene Petri dish that was
incubated 30 min at room temperature with 100 μL of a 50 μg/mL
rabbit IgG solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). After three
rinsing steps (PBS + Tween-20 0.05, PBS, and DI water), the surface
was blocked for 30 min with BSA (1% in PBS) and rinsed. Fluorescently
labeled rabbit anti-IgG was deposited on the surface with the MFP
for different deposition times.

Automated Deposition of
Antigens on a Surface with the MFP
After priming the fluidic
tubing with the appropriate solutions
(fluorescent anti-IgG in the inner injection, PBS everywhere else),
a Matlab script was used for automating the sequential surface processing
steps: stage movement for precise spotting, and valve switching for
recirculation and pressure control. Pressure controllers and switch
valves were controlled by the manufacturer’s API and the stages
with a standard serial protocol.

FEM Modeling
Steady-state
2D transport simulations
were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics version 4.2. We used incompressible
fluids, open boundaries, and nonslip conditions on surfaces as parameters.
The model couples the solution of the Navier–Stokes equation
and the convection-diffusion equations. All liquids were chosen to
be water (incompressible Newtonian fluid with a density of 998 kg/m3 and a dynamic viscosity of 0.001 N s/m2). The
diffusion constant of the analyte was set to D =
3.8 × 10–7 cm2/s, which corresponds
to the diffusion constant of an IgG molecule.

Image Analysis
Time-lapse images were analyzed using
ImageJ and NIS Elements Basic Research software suite (Nikon). Scale
bars were calculated from bright-field images. To account for a potentially
uneven illumination pattern, each image was divided by a control image
taken on an empty zone of the slide. After removal of the background,
the processed image was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity.

Statistical Analysis
Error bars represent the standard
deviation. If no error bars are visible, the standard deviation is
smaller than the symbol representing the mean value. “n” refers to the number of data points unless specified
otherwise.

Results and Discussion
To implement
an MFP-based antibody/antigen assay, we used a standard
polystyrene Petri dish as substrate. After incubation of IgG, we processed
the surface with the MFP using a solution of fluorescently labeled
anti-IgG for different durations with a constant flow rate (1 μL/min)
and an apex-to-surface distance d = 30 μm.
The results of these assays (n = 5 experiments per
deposition time) are presented in Figure 5. The experiments were performed both with
and without recirculation of the processing liquid, along with a reference
experiment using pipet deposition. The fluorescence intensity of deposited
anti-IgG was used to assess the deposition efficiency and quality.
Deposition using the MFP (Figure 5, black squares and red dots) showed a higher efficiency
than pipet deposition (Figure 5, blue diamonds). With an antigen concentration of 50 μg/mL,
we saturated the surface in less than 3 min with the MFP and in 6
min with the pipet. Interestingly, we observed no significant difference
between deposition with and without recirculation, as both methods
use convection-enhanced deposition. However, the model for convective
deposition predicts saturation to occur faster than what we observed
in the experiments. We hypothesize that these discrepancies arise
from (i) three-dimensional effects that are not accounted for in the
model, resulting in a reduction of the effective flow velocity and
therefore a reduction of advective transport to the surface, and (ii)
the fact that kon, koff, and the binding sites surface density bm were derived from the diffusion-driven deposition experiments
(see Figure 5, blue
line and symbols) and may be different for the MFP-based deposition
experiments. A striking example of the benefits of recirculation using
the MFP is that the total volume used after 10 min with recirculation
(1 μL) was 1 order of magnitude lower than without recirculation
(10 μL), while reaching an identical density of captured antigens.
Ultimately, this approach would lead to either a drastic reduction
of antigens needed for the assay or, conversely, a reduction of the
assay time if a preconcentration of the analyte is done prior to recirculation.
Moreover, when using recirculation, the total volume of analyte needed
is largely independent of the reaction duration. This result is particularly
relevant in the case of low-concentration analytes, where the reaction
time can be in the range of hours. Recirculation therefore enables
enhanced kinetics as the result of convection, while improving reagent
usage through multiple circulations of the same volume.

Most biopatterning applications require deposition on multiple
zones with high spatial resolution, typically in the micrometer range.
A key advantage of the MFP is its capacity to interact locally with
a surface and to scan large areas rapidly.36 Leveraging this capacity, we investigated the recirculation of a
given volume of liquid on multiple positions on a substrate. Multizones
deposition can be used for localized capture of antigens from a sample,
and using a single microliter, recirculation allows multiple independent
capture zones to be probed. Similarly, an unknown concentration of
antigen can be recirculated for different lengths of times on multiple
areas on an antibody-coated surface. This can be leveraged to determine
the adequate deposition time on the surface to prevent over- and under-exposure
of the sample of interest in the capture zone. We demonstrated these
two aspects by recirculating different concentrations of a fluorescently
labeled IgG on an anti-IgG-coated surface (see Figure 6a.) and checked the deposition density after
different deposition times (see Figure 6b).

Figure 6 Multispot deposition of goat anti-IgG using recirculation
with
the MFP. (a) Image of the deposition of anti-IgG solution using 1.6

1 μL of solution (170 spots in total). The flow direction was
switched every ten spots. (d) Average fluorescence intensity measured
on each spot compared with the predictions of our models. (e and f)
Intrafootprint variation within one spot (<6% variation).

These results indicate that an
adequate deposition time (signal
intensity detectable and no saturation) for the highest concentration
was obtained in under 1 min, whereas the lowest one would require
10 min to yield a signal sufficient for analysis. This use of recirculation
is a unique implementation of a “reverse assay” in which
the sample is processed successively on multiple zones. These independent
zones may contain different capture antibodies, giving access to multiple
assays with a minimal volume or, for a single antibody, enable better
control of the capture density and, ultimately, quantification of
antigens concentration through multiple deposition durations.

We also investigated the possibility of using a limited and small
volume of processing liquid in the MFP head to deposit a large number
of spots on the surface. We deposited 170 spots (see Figure 6c), switching the flow direction
every ten spots, with the probe staying 10 s on top of each spot.
Working close to the surface (10 μm), we limited the dilution
to the extent that only a minimal decrease in fluorescence was observed
between the first and the last spot (Figure 6d). This decrease in fluorescence was predicted
by combining the two analytical models describing dilution during
recirculation and binding to the surface. The models exhibited very
good correlation with the experimental values. A volume of 1.66 μL
of fluorescently labeled IgG were used to perform deposition of these
170 spots, so each spot corresponds to a “used” volume
of 9.7 nL.

Finally, we investigated the quality of the spots
deposited and
found intra- and interfootprint variations of 5.8% and 3.4%, respectively
(see Figure 5e,f),
confirming the advantages of “wet” methods for presenting
an antibody to a surface in terms of deposition quality. We hypothesize
these relatively small deposition variations to be due to the type
of substrate used (standard, untreated polystyrene Petri dish) and
that the deposition quality could be further increased by using engineered
substrates.

Conclusion
We described, characterized, and validated
a new method for surface
processing and biopatterning. This method exploits the hierarchical
implementation of the HFC to efficiently present micro- to nanoliter
volumes of analytes on surfaces. The analytical models we present
provide guidelines on minimizing the dilution of the processing liquid
and enhancing the deposition kinetics by controlling parameters such
as the apex-to-surface distance, the flow rates and the deposition
time. This enables the rapid processing of areas ranging from 5 ×
5 μm2 to 1 × 1 cm2 in large substrates,
such as Petri dishes and glass slides, with volumes in the microliter
range. As an example, we deposited 170 antibody–antigen spots
with a per-spot volume of 9.7 nL and with a variation in deposition
homogeneity below 6%. In comparison, state-of-the-art inkjet tools
would require a comparable volume per spot but achieve limited deposition
homogeneity. Importantly, the high quality of the patterns deposited
with our method is compatible with the needs of quantitative surface
assays. Experiments comparing the deposition efficiency showed a 3-fold
improvement of the deposition speed and a 10-fold decrease of the
total volume needed for a surface assay when using convection-enhanced
deposition and liquid recirculation in the MFP. Such outcomes are
particularly relevant in the case of expensive biochemicals or when
the concentration of analytes is so low that it would impede deposition
efficiency. In addition, we demonstrated that this tool can probe
multiple capture areas independently with a single limited volume
of a biological (clinical) sample.

For efficient
biopatterning, we leveraged the strengths of the
MFP and the underlying physics of HFC. First, the hydrodynamic confinement
of the processing liquid with the MFP eliminates the need for microfluidic
networks and channels or multiphase systems for localization and compartmentalization.
The MFP provides a dynamic and highly versatile means of localizing
and presenting the processing liquid on a surface immersed in an aqueous
environment. This method is compatible with Petri dishes, glass slides,
as well as more challenging substrates with varying topologies, such
as cell cultures and tissues sections. Second, this method can be
scaled to form larger or smaller footprints by changing the aperture
size, aperture spacing, and flow rates with dimensions ranging from
hundreds of nanometers to a few millimeters. The scanning capability
of the probe36 allows the patterning on
large surfaces, typically in the centimeter range, with the possibility
of creating arrays of up to 30 000 spots/cm2 with
a spot size of 10 × 10 μm2. Third, the capacity
of the MFP to rapidly switch liquids37 on
top of the substrate makes it a relevant tool for implementing complex
biochemistries requiring multiple consecutive chemicals to be dispensed
on the surface or even for manufacturing protein microarrays.

A current limitation of the device is its throughput. In this paper,
a single spot is patterned at a given time, but we foresee processing
multiple positions on the surface in parallel by leveraging standard
microfluidic channel bifurcations implemented on the probe. We believe
that the MFP might not be the preferred tool when the incubation or
reaction time is in the range of tens of hours. However, as discussed
in this paper, most surface chemistries will be accelerated by convective
transport, and thus long overnight incubation will likely not be required.
For specific applications, increasing the recirculated volume is readily
feasible, but working with processing liquid volumes below 100 nL
is challenging to implement in the current probe configuration. However,
we believe that the microliter to milliliter range is appropriate
for most biopatterning applications, as it is compatible with standard
volumes used in industrial methods, such as inkjets and pin-spotters.
Finally, the asymmetric teardrop shape of the deposition area can
be altered by using different aperture spacings and geometries. The
method presented in this paper combines five of the six attributes
of an ideal biopatterning approach, namely, low reagent consumption,
high deposition rate (kinetics), efficient reagent usage, low variation
in the spots deposited, and micrometer-scale precision in deposition.
We strongly believe that this combination of advantages creates a
powerful tool for an efficient and high-quality patterning of receptors
on surfaces and thus will enable quantitative assays in discovery
research, point-of-care devices, large-scale surface patterning, and
reverse immunoassays and will catalyze the manufacturing of protein
microarrays. This method will be a unique facilitator in quantitative
biology and precision diagnostics.
