We describe a platform for high-throughput
electrophoretic mobility
shift assays (EMSAs) for identification and characterization of molecular
binding reactions. A photopatterned free-standing polyacrylamide gel
array comprised of 8 mm-scale polyacrylamide gel strips acts as a
chassis for 96 concurrent EMSAs. The high-throughput EMSAs was employed
to assess binding of the Vc2 cyclic-di-GMP riboswitch to its ligand.
In optimizing the riboswitch EMSAs on the free-standing polyacrylamide
gel array, three design considerations were made: minimizing sample
injection dispersion, mitigating evaporation from the open free-standing
polyacrylamide gel structures during electrophoresis, and controlling
unit-to-unit variation across the large-format free-standing polyacrylamide
gel array. Optimized electrophoretic mobility shift conditions allowed
for 10% difference in mobility shift baseline resolution within 3
min. The powerful 96-plex EMSAs increased the throughput to ∼10
data/min, notably more efficient than either conventional slab EMSAs
(∼0.01 data/min) or even microchannel based microfluidic EMSAs
(∼0.3 data/min). The free-standing polyacrylamide gel EMSAs
yielded reliable quantification of molecular binding and associated
mobility shifts for a riboswitch–ligand interaction, thus demonstrating
a screening assay platform suitable for riboswitches and potentially
a wide range of RNA and other macromolecular targets.

==== Body
Riboswitches
are functional
RNA molecules that play a key role in gene regulation of many important
processes in diverse bacterial species.1 Located in the 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA, riboswitches
directly bind to small molecule metabolites through their aptamer
domain, triggering a conformational change that alters expression
of the downstream gene.2 Owing to selective
ligand binding, riboswitches have garnered interest as promising and
largely unexplored antibiotic drug targets.3 To maximize the chance of discovering riboswitch-targeting antibacterial
ligands, a rapid and robust screening platform is required to efficiently
identify potential riboswitch-binding compounds from compound libraries.3,4 Gold-standard screening tools include fluorescence polarization
(FP)5 and fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET).6 While powerful, FP and
FRET are not readily implemented as high-throughput assays, as both
are sample-intensive, are slow, and require substantial infrastructure.7 Recently, droplet microfluidic FP and FRET have
improved assay throughput but have not been applied to the study of
riboswitches.8,9

Alternatively, electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (EMSAs), introduced
by Garner and Revzin,10 have played an
important role in the study of numerous molecular binding interactions
including riboswitches. Widely employed, EMSAs measure changes in
the physical properties of a target analyte (i.e., size, charge, conformation)
upon binding with a ligand. Binding-induced changes can shift the
electrophoretic mobility of the target analyte, a measurable quantity
allowing quantitative characterization of the binding reaction.11,12 Yet, conventional EMSAs are conducted with slab polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE), which is low-throughput and not suitable for
screening assays.13,14 For example, binding of the Vc2
GEMM-I riboswitch to its ligand cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), an important
second messenger in bacteria,15 induces
a significant structural compaction of the riboswitch aptamer.16 This compaction results in a higher electrophoretic
mobility in the gel matrix than its free form. To electrophoretically
resolve the bound and unbound RNAs via conventional slab-gel EMSAs
requires up to 17 h.17

Capillary
electrophoresis (CE) is an efficient separation modality
and Stebbins et al.18 introduced CE for
EMSAs to analyze binding between the trp repressor in Escherichia
coli and the trp operator (DNA). The mobility shift was resolved
in 6 min. To further advance the quantitative capacity and throughput
of EMSAs, Karns and colleagues17 introduced
microfluidic PAGE to study the binding characteristics of S-adenosylmethionine-I riboswitches. A key advantage of
this microfluidic electrophoresis platform is the efficient heat dissipation
due to a large surface area-to-volume ratio in microchannels. This
favorable thermal transport characteristic enables the use of high
electric field (e.g., 400 V/cm in-chip and ∼10 V/cm on slab
PAGE), thus resolving binding pairs in 30 s (compared to 17 h on slab
PAGE). However, regardless of the rapid analysis, the microchip format
was limited to single and serial implementation of separations. As
a result, the entire assay protocol (i.e., loading-separation-washing)
required ∼3 min, limiting usefulness in high-throughput screening.
A recent breakthrough in increasing analytical throughput takes advantage
of multiplexed formats. In 2000, Ferrance et al.19 demonstrated an 8-plex multichannel microfluidic separation
system for rapid clinical diagnostics. Later, Ross and colleagues20 demonstrated a 16-plex gradient elution moving
boundary electrophoresis tool for monitoring enzyme activity and inhibition.
Researchers have also introduced microfluidic systems compatible with
powerful, conventional biological tools (e.g., a microplate format).
For example, a 384-plex radial microfluidic capillary electrophoresis
tool developed by Emrich et al.21 supported
ultrahigh-throughput genetic analyses. In 2003, Gaunt et al.22 established a microplate gel array platform
for SNP genotyping, in which a PAG molded with sample wells was seated
on a silane-treated glass plate. With the molding strategy, 768 wells
were fabricated in the PAG sheet, yielding the highest reported multiplexed
electrophoresis tool to our knowledge. At the single-cell level, Gutzkow
et al.23 developed a 96-plex minigel platform
for high-throughput comet assays, using cell-suspended agarose droplets
patterned on a piece of polyester film (Gel bond). Engelward and colleagues24,25 have developed the CometChip, a sheet of agarose gel patterned with
microwells that house single cells. The CometChip has been applied
to assess genotoxicity mediated by engineered nanoparticles. In 2014,
we introduced a microfluidic device that enables completion of thousands
of concurrent single-cell western blots.100

Building on our previous work which reported electrophoretic
resolution
of proteins in 96-plex fsPAG electrophoresis (fsPAGE) assay,26 we now address
an unmet throughput need for riboswitch screening. We detail design
considerations for successful introduction of multiplexed fsPAG-EMSAs. Screening for changes in riboswitch conformation
presents new analytical challenges for an EMSA system. For context,
our previous fsPAGE protein analyses measured large
relative electrophoretic mobility shifts between adjacent peaks (i.e.,
2× changes in the electrophoretic mobility) in a standard low
conductivity buffer. Riboswitch mobility shifts are comparatively
small, 10% relative mobility shifts (bound and unbound), and require
high conductivity buffers, which limits the possible assay time before
heating effects disrupt the assay. In this work, we quantitatively
characterized the fsPAGE platform and optimized the
system to improve sample injection and resolving power over short
migration distances and assay times. Through optimization studies,
we determined optimal conditions for performing high-throughput (<3
min electrophoresis) and massively multiplexed (96-plex) fsPAGE. In the process, we elucidated fundamental physical relationships
inherent to the fsPAGE platform, not previously described.26 In addition, this work analyzed how the electrode
proximity to EMSA units affected electrophoretic velocity variation
across the large 96-plex array. Through optimization, we achieved
excellent unit-to-unit uniformity across a 96-plex array, an important
advance over previous fsPAGE studies.26 After optimization, we applied the fsPAG-EMSA platform to 96 concurrent EMSAs of the Vc2 riboswitch aptamer
binding interaction with c-di-GMP. fsPAG-EMSAs yielded
assay throughput of 10 data points per minute, orders of magnitude
more efficient than either conventional slab or microfluidic EMSAs.
Successful fsPAG-EMSAs may form the basis for large-scale
screening of riboswitches and other macromolecular targets.

Materials
and Methods
Reagents
Solutions of 30% (w/v) (29:1) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide,
glacial acetic acid, glycerol, and Triton X-100 were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 10× Tris-borate-magnesium–potassium
(TBMK) run buffer was prepared by dissolving 890 mM tris base (Fisher
Scientific, Hampton, NH), 890 mM boric acid (Fisher Scientific), 30
mM magnesium chloride (EMD chemical, Gibbstown, NJ), and 100 mM potassium
chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) into 1 L of molecular biology grade (DNase-,
RNase- and Protease-free) water (Mediatech, Manassas, VA). AlexaFluor
488 (AF488) conjugated Trypsin Inhibitor (TI*, 21 kDa), Ovalbumin
(OVA*, 45 kDa) were purchased from Life Technologies Corporation (Carlsbad,
CA). Photoinitiator 2,2-azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)
propionamide] (VA-086) was purchased from Wako Chemical (Richmond,
VA). GelBond PAG film was purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland).
Photomasks were designed with AutoCad student edition (Autodesk, San
Rafael, CA) and printed with a Brother MFC-9320C digital color printer
(Brother International Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ) on a transparent
film (3M, St. Paul, MN).

Preparation of RNAs
Fluorescent
riboswitch RNAs were
prepared following previously described protocols.17 Briefly, DNA templates were generated using primers that
appended the T7 promoter sequence directly upstream of the aptamer
sequence. RNAs were then transcribed in vitro using
T7 RNA polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, Massachusetts) and purified by denaturing
PAGE following standard protocols. Following oxidation of the 3′
ribose with NaIO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), RNAs were reacted with
AlexaFluor 488 hydrazide (Life Technologies) in the dark and purified
via denaturing PAGE. The accurate RNA concentration was determined
via a thermal hydrolysis assay27 to remove
effects of hypochromicity, and the labeling efficiency was calculated
as previously described.17

Protein
(TI* and OVA*) solutions were prepared by diluting a stock solution
with water and 10× TBMK into indicated concentrations. To prepare
the binding reaction solution, c-di-GMP riboswitch, 10× TBMK
buffer, 1 mg/mL yeast tRNA (Life Technologies), and water were mixed
in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf Lo-Bind tube at indicated concentrations. The
final mixture solution contained 1× TBMK, 100 μg/mL yeast
tRNA, and 1 μM c-di-GMP riboswitch. Yeast tRNA is used to improve
the stability of RNA against degradation. The mixture was heated at
70 °C for 3 min and cooled for 10 min at room temperature to
renature the RNA. c-di-GMP and an internal standard (TI*) were added
into the solution. The sample mixture was placed in a dark room and
equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h.

fsPAG
Fabrication and Electrophoresis Operation
fsPAGs were fabricated via UV photopatterning.26 The PAG precursor solution contained 20% T acrylamide
(w/v), 3.3% C bis-acrylamide cross-linker (w/w), and 0.2% VA-086 photoinitiator
(w/v). Prior to UV exposure, the precursor solution was degassed for
2–3 min under house vacuum with sonication. To briefly recap
the fabrication, a surface-functionalized polymer sheet (Gelbond)
was placed on top of a borosilicate glass substrate. Two spacers with
predefined thickness (greater than Gelbond) were then aligned on two
sides of Gelbond and a glass plate was laid on spacers to act as a
top cover. The PAG precursor solution was pipetted into the gap between
the Gelbond and the glass cover, such that the height of fsPAG was defined by the height difference between the spacers and
the Gelbond (from 70 to 600 μm). The PAG precursor solution
was then exposed to UV light through a photomask, selectively polymerizing
the regions of interest. The intensity and time for UV exposure were
optimized for each monomer concentration. For 20% T 3.3% C PAGs, 70
s exposure at 20 mW/cm2 (measured by OAI 308 UV intensity
meter, OAI, San Jose, CA) was employed. After UV exposure, the polymerized fsPAG structures were gently washed with water to remove
unpolymerized monomers. The entire process (mask design, printing,
and gel fabrication) takes 1 h, making the process amenable to rapid
prototyping of new device designs and gel conditions. fsPAG height was measured with MicroXAM-100 Optical Profilometer (ADE
phase Shift, Tucson, AZ).

After photopatterning, the fsPAG was soaked in run buffer for 10 min on an Orbitron
shaker. When removed, a pipet tip connected to house vacuum was applied
to and around each well to remove residual run buffer via suction.
Sample solution was then manually pipetted into the sample wells.
Two electrode wicks wetted with run buffer were aligned atop the fsPAG at both ends of the sheet-like structures. Graphite
electrodes were placed in contact with the electrode wicks. The entire
electrophoresis setup was housed in an environmental chamber26 (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1) and connected to an external high-voltage power supplier
(PowerPac HV; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Unlike conventional slab gel
electrophoresis, submerging the thin fsPAG structure
in buffer confounds the assay in three ways. First, submerging the fsPAG structure makes loading of the <1 μL sample
volumes into the injection wells difficult. This is because ultralow
volume loading relies on hydrophilicity of the well surface which
loses effectiveness when submerging under buffer solution. Second,
owing to the placement of the electrode wicks and the use of thin fsPAG features (z-axis), submersion leads
to loss of analyte, as species readily disperse out of the thin gel
and into the covering buffer layer due to diffusion and the z-component of the electric field. Mass losses to the buffer
layer result in reduced detection sensitivity performance. Lastly,
the covering buffer greatly increases the system conductivity, which
leads to higher current value and temperature, potentially affecting
the binding affinity. Unless otherwise stated, fsPAGE was performed with 100 μm 20% T 3.3% C fsPAG in 1× TBMK buffer containing 20% glycerol at an applied
electric field of 60 V/cm.

Imaging
Fluorescence imaging was
conducted using an
inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-70) equipped with
a 2× objective (PlanApo, N.A. = 0.08, Olympus, Center Valley,
PA). The illumination source was an X-Cite exacte mercury lamp (Lumen
Dynamics, Mississauga, Canada) filtered through a XF100-3 filter (Omega
Optical, Battleboro, VT). A Peltier cooled charge-coupled device (CCD)
camera (CoolSNAP HQ2, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) attached to the
microscope collected fluorescence images. Large area imaging for the
96-plex EMSAs was performed with a scan slide function controlled
by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Image processing
was performed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and subsequent data
analysis was performed with OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab, Northampton,
MA). Fluorescence intensity profiles were generated by averaging the
fluorescence signal over the transverse dimension of fsPAG, and each peak was fitted with a Gaussian distribution. To quantify
the fluorescence intensity of the analytes, we took the height of
the Gaussian peaks. To quantify the resolving power of electrophoresis,
we utilized the metric separation resolution (SR), defined as SR =
ΔL/4σ. ΔL is the
distance between bands (scale with migration distance) and σ
the standard deviation (bandwidth = 4σ).

Computational Simulations
Simulation of fsPAGE was performed on COMSOL Multiphysics
v4.2a (COMSOL, Inc., Palo
Alto, CA) with Transport of Diluted Species and Electric Currents
3D physics modules. Developed to assess nonuniformity of electric
field lines, our model neglected thermal effects and employed two
assumptions. First, evaporation during electrophoresis was neglected
and the height of the fsPAG structures was assumed
to remain constant. Second, temperature was assumed to remain constant.
Run buffer (1× Tris-glycine) conductivity in aqueous solution
was measured by a B-173 Compact Conductivity Meter (Horiba Scientific,
Kyoto, Japan). Run buffer conductivity in the fsPAG
structures was estimated to be similar to that of PAG in glass microfluidic
chips, as described by Duncombe et al.28 The mobility and diffusivity of the model protein, TI, was estimated
as per Herr and Singh29 and Hughes et al.30 The voltage boundary conditions were set at
each terminus of the fsPAG structure. For post-simulation
data analysis, we averaged the protein concentrations over the transverse fsPAG lane dimension at the 120 s time point to generate
analyte concentration profiles, which were then analyzed in OriginPro
8.0 to calculate the band widths. In simulations, electric field strength
was set to 60 V/cm.

Results and Discussion
To develop
a high-throughput fsPAG-EMSA platform
for screening riboswitch-ligand interactions (Figure 1A), we first focused on device and assay optimization, including
control of injection dispersion, evaporation from the open gel structures,
and the unit-to-unit variation across 96 concurrent separations. We
applied the optimized 96-plex EMSA array (Figure 1B) to study binding of the Vc2 c-di-GMP riboswitch to its
ligand.

The sample well is embedded in the fsPAG. Gel structure
and sample fluid heights are indicated by H and h.

Sample Loading in fsPAGE Structures
Electrophoretic separations in
planar microfluidic devices traditionally
employ a t-channel configuration where sample loading and subsequent
separation occur in each of the two orthogonal channels. However,
in fsPAG, sample loading and injection are performed
along a single spatial axis, in a manner similar to conventional slab
PAGE (Figure 1B). Therefore, the quality of
the electrophoretic separation is sensitive not just to injection
dispersion of analyte but also to conditions in the sample well during
the separation process. Given the open format and orientation of the fsPAG structures, sample is pipetted into the sample well
from above (Figure 2A). Depending on the volume
of the sample well and the volume of the sample itself, the sample
aliquot may not necessarily fill the entire well volume. Thus, to
understand the sensitivity of separation performance on sample loading
in this open sample well configuration, we simulated fsPAGE and the associated electric field strengths across a range of
sample aliquot heights (h) relative to the fsPAG structure height (H). Though the
simulation is performed for TI, the results of band shape and electric
field also apply to a wide range of biomolecules including riboswitches.
Electrical resistance of the sample well can be described by Rw = ρ·lw/(ww·h), where
ρ is sample resistivity, and lw and ww are the axial length and width of the well.
Consequently, reducing h would increase the resistance
in the well, causing a greater voltage drop over the sample well region
along the separation axis (Uw) and, by
Ohm’s law, a reduced voltage drop over the gel region along
the separation axis (Ug), as Uw + Ug = U (applied voltage). As shown in Figure 2A,
when h/H ≥ 0.4, no notable
transverse band skew or associated skew-induced axial dispersion was
observed. Appreciable nonuniformities in the electric field distributions
were also not evident. In contrast, when h/H < 0.4, skewing of the protein peak was observed as
is the reduced migration distance. The h/H < 0.4 configuration essentially described a poorly
filled sample well. Dispersion observed in the poorly filled well
cases is attributed to high resistance and correspondingly high voltage
drops across the sample well when limited sample volume is present.
Protein migration distance (Figure 2B) increased
monotonically with increasing fractional fluid height in the well
(h/H). Concomitantly, we observed
a general trend of decrease in bandwidth with increasing h/H. Consequently, we adopt sample well loading height
in the 0.4 < h/H < 1.0 range
as a design rule for fsPAGE.

sample loading heights. Axial well length = 1 mm, E = 60 V/cm. (B) Simulation results of bandwidth and migration distance
for different h/H conditions.

Thermal Analysis of Open fsPAG Structures
For a given fsPAG structure, we consider Joule
heating during electrophoresis. We can describe the heat balance by 1  On the left-hand side of
eq 1, we see heat generation given by the product
of the applied
voltage (U) and the electrical current (I). The right-hand side represents heat loss from convection q̇C and evaporation q̇E, where A is the fsPAG structure surface area. We can estimate A = lw and I = UσgwH/l, where l is fsPAG structure length, w is
the structure width, H is the structure height, and
σg is fsPAG conductivity. Given
the large ratio (50–100) of the planar dimension (∼1
cm) to the fsPAG height (∼0.1 mm), we neglect
heat dissipation from the sides of the gel structures. We can relate
heat losses to operating conditions and the structure geometry: 2  Equation 2 states the
sum of q̇C and q̇E increases with σg and H. According to Langmuir’s evaporation model and the Antoine
equation describing the temperature–vapor pressure relationship,31 both q̇C and q̇E increase with temperature. Therefore,
increasing either σg or H would
result in both higher q̇C and q̇E. In addition, the relative evaporative
loss rate (fractional water loss in the gel body) also increases with H (see the Supporting Information). Dependences on geometry and thermal properties are directly relevant
to riboswitch fsPAG-EMSA operation. First, riboswitch
binding to ligand depends on the local ions and their concentrations.
As such, the TMBK buffer employed for riboswitch EMSAs is appreciably
more conductive than typical gel electrophoresis buffers. For context,
the TMBK buffer is ∼7 times more conductive than tris-glycine
buffer systems previously utilized in fsPAGE for
protein analysis. Second, the open architecture of the fsPAG structures is susceptible to evaporative loss, leading to weak
electrophoretic stability.

To understand the as-of-yet unexplored
influence of device geometry (H) on the thermal and
electrical characteristics of fsPAG-EMSAs, we monitored
the relative current (normalized by initial current value) during fsPAGE for a range of H values (70–600
μm). For gels where H < 70 μm, both
fabrication and sample loading were difficult, causing irreproducible
initial conditions so these fsPAG structures were
not considered. For all structures studied, U was
held fixed (E = 60 V/cm) and the TBMK run buffer
contained 20% glycerol (glycerol helps to improve current stability
and details can be found in a later section). As shown in Figure 3A, taller fsPAG structures (H ≥ 400 μm) exhibited an initial ramp up in
current followed by a steep decrease in current after ∼60 s
of operation. The shorter fsPAG structures (H ≤ 200 μm) showed less dynamic behavior but
did exhibit a slow reduction of current during operation. Especially
evident in the large structures, we attribute the initial current
rise to an increase in gel temperature owing to Joule heating which,
in turn, affects evaporation and ion concentration, leading to increased
conductivity. In accordance, we attribute the observed subsequent
sharp decrease in current to physical collapse of the gel structures
owing to dehydration. Dehydration shrinks the porous gel matrix, thus
reducing the conducting cross-section of the fsPAG
lane. During the period when fluid is still present, the increasing
resistance would reduce the current. Given these observations, we
sought to minimize the rate of current drop to improve EMSA performance
stability over an anticipated EMSA duration (Figure 3B). Using estimates from enclosed microchannel EMSAs of the
c-di-GMP riboswitch (mobility shift of 2.5 × 10–6 cm2/V s, work in preparation), a 3 min separation is
anticipated to allow full resolution of the mobility shift between
bound and unbound riboswitch (Figure 3B). At
this 3 min time point, a fsPAG structure with H = 100 μm maintains ∼90% of the initial current
value, whereas the H = 600 μm structure maintains
just ∼40% of the initial current. Consequently, all subsequent
EMSAs were conducted in fsPAG structures of 100 μm
tall.

electrophoresis. (A) Current stability over time during fsPAGE at E = 60 V/cm. fsPAG of 70–100
μm preserves most conductivity. (B) Current drop measurement
for a range of fsPAG structure heights at 3 min.
The highest relative current (white data point) is observed at 100
μm.

Glycerol Improves fsPAG Thermal, Structural,
and Assay Performance
Glycerol offers a lower vapor pressure
and evaporation rate than water,32 thus
we hypothesized that the addition of glycerol to the fsPAGE buffer should decrease the evaporative losses. However, the
viscosity increase stemming from glycerol addition would also decrease
analyte mobility and dispersion (via diffusion).33,34 While glycerol was employed as a sample additive in our previous fsPAGE protein assays, we sought here to understand the
influence of glycerol contents on thermal and electrophoretic characteristics
of the gel system as well as the assay repeatability during fsPAGE-EMSAs in high conductivity buffers.26 To determine a suitable glycerol concentration for fsPAG-EMSAs, we investigated the fsPAGE
by monitoring the electrical current, structural integrity, analyte
mobility, analyte bandwidth, and resolving power of electrophoresis
over a range of glycerol concentrations and electrophoresis times.
In Figure 4A we monitored the electrical current
in a 100 μm tall fsPAG every 10 s for a total
360 s of electrophoresis (60 V/cm). The fsPAGE run
buffers contained varying glycerol concentrations from 0% to 30% (v/v).
An immediate increase in relative current was observed during the
first 30 s of electrophoresis followed by a monotonic decline in current
over the remainder of the experiment. As expected, the additional
glycerol concentration improved the electrical stability over the
course of electrophoresis, as compared to systems with no glycerol
present. Compared to a system with no glycerol, a system with 30%
glycerol supported more than double the current after 6 min of operation
(57.6% for 30% glycerol vs 23.5% for no glycerol). We attribute the
improved current stability of a glycerol containing system to the
enhanced fsPAG structural integrity resulting from
reduced evaporative loss.

stability. (A) Current dynamics of fsPAG structures

band migration during fsPAGE for 0% and 20% glycerol

To explore the impact of glycerol addition on electrical
conductivity,
we measured both the current and the height of fsPAG structures after 0, 3, and 6 min of electrophoresis run times
for a range of glycerol concentrations. Addition of glycerol to the
run buffer increases hydrodynamic resistance33,34 and reduces ion mobilities. As detailed in Figure 4A, the initial current measured in a 30% glycerol device was
60% of the current measured in a fsPAG structure
free of glycerol. We further noted that the addition of >25% glycerol
to the fsPAG structures modulates electrical current
stability over time (Figure 4A). Employing
the fsPAG height as a proxy for the volume of solution
retained in the fsPAG structure, we further observed
that loss of fsPAG height during electrophoresis
decreased with increasing glycerol concentration (Figure 4B). After 6 min of electrophoresis, the height reduction
of fsPAG structures containing 30% glycerol was just
∼20% lower than the initial structure height, whereas structures
with no added glycerol saw height losses of >80%. On the basis
of
these observations, we hypothesize that glycerol assists with maintaining fsPAG structural stability thus extending the effective
electrophoresis time.

To evaluate the influence of enhanced
viscosity (reducing mobility
and diffusion) on the separation performance, we performed fsPAGE across a range of glycerol conditions on H = 100 μm tall structures with fluorescent scalar
TI*. For the conditions studied, the resultant TI* migration distance
(L) and bandwidth (4σ) are reported in Figure 4C. As anticipated, increasing glycerol concentrations
reduced both the TI* migration distance and bandwidth. To quantify
the resolving power, we considered the ratio between migration distance
and bandwidth (L/4σ) as an approximation for
separation resolution in more complex samples. After 3 and 6 min of
electrophoresis time, structures containing glycerol yielded notably
higher resolving powers than structures containing no glycerol.

To assess device reliability, we compared the band shape over three
separate trials in structures with 0 and 20% glycerol concentrations.
Figure 4D shows resultant images after 3 min
of electrophoresis time, with dramatic band distortion and variation
observed in the replicates with no glycerol present. Unsuitable repeatability
and bad band shape control were likely caused by rapid evaporation,
giving rise to nonuniform gel drying which leads to heterogeneity
in analyte mobility across the gel. In contrast, structures containing
higher glycerol concentrations (20%) yielded a consistent band with
notably less transverse skew. Thus, run buffer containing 20% glycerol
provided performance suitable for 3 to 6 min separations at (60 V/cm)
in fsPAG-EMSA current stability, separation performance,
and reliability.

Unit-to-Unit Variation Across a Large fsPAGE
Array
To realize a high-throughput EMSA platform, we fabricated
a 96-plex 20% T 3.3% C fsPAG array measuring 60 mm
× 70 mm (Figure 5). The array is comprised
of 8 parallel fsPAG lanes, each housing 12 separation
units in series with a 4.5 mm unit-to-unit distance. To electrically
address the array, graphite electrodes were placed atop electrode
wicks orthogonal to each fsPAG lane and ∼2
mm away from the first and last separation unit in each lane. In previous
work, we observed significant unit-to-unit variation in analyte migration
distance on large fsPAG arrays, especially in units
on the periphery of the device.26 To understand
and address migration variation, we measured the migration distance
of a scalar (fluorescently labeled 500 nM OVA*) at a set time and
tested significance of unit-to-unit variation with an ANOVA test (Figure 5A and see the Supporting Information for details). In particular, we sought to assess the spatial variation
in migration distance between peripheral groups and the central region
(groups assigned in Figure 5A). For each peripheral
group, ANOVA was performed to analyze its variation against the central
region group a, where no spatial variation is present. In the present
ANOVA study with 96-plex fsPAGE, the Fcritical value is 4.00 (α = 0.05), meaning any calculated F value greater than 4.00 indicates significant difference
in migration distance. For fsPAG lanes at the top
and bottom of the array, no significant variation in migration distances
were observed as compared to migration distances observed in the central
array region (F values 0.14 and 0.70, respectively).
In contrast, regions adjacent to the electrodes showed significant
variation in scalar migration distance. As compared to the central
region of the array, the first and second columns adjacent to the
cathode electrode supported a higher scalar velocity (F values 438 and 121, respectively) and the 12th column directly adjacent
to anode supported a lower scalar velocity (F value
205). We hypothesized that electrolysis during electrophoresis altered
the pH proximal to each electrode. At the cathode, electrolysis should
generate excess OH– ions and elevate the local pH
causing proteins to increases in negative charge and mobility. Conversely
the anode would see generation of excess H+ ions and lower
the local pH, thus reducing protein charge and mobility.

in a “band bowing” on this unit (excluded from calculations).
96 units were grouped into regions. Central region group, a; other
peripheral groups, b–f. F value for migration
distance: a–b, 438; a–c, 121; a–d, 205; a–e,
0.14; a–f, 0.7. Significant variations were observed for a–b;
a–c; and a–d (squared in red). No significant variations
were observed for other groups (squared in green), α = 0.05.
(B) Optimized fsPAG design with offset between electrodes
and fsPAG units. Central region group, a; peripheral
groups, b–d. F values: a–b, 1.67; a–c,
2.21; a–d, 0.05; no significant variations were observed (squared
in green), α = 0.05. Fcritical =
4.00 for ANOVA on 96-plex fsPAG.

While there were several possible approaches to address pH
polarization,
including increasing buffering capacity or implementing buffer reservoirs,
we opted to simply redesign the electrode region of the 96-plex fsPAG array to offset the graphite electrodes from the first
and last separation columns. The modified electrode regions increased
the array area from 4200 mm2 to 7000 mm2. With
the offset electrode placement (Figure 5B),
ANOVA reported no significant region to region variation in migration
distance for the scalar (F = 1.67, 2.21, and 0.05
for columns 1, 2, and 12, respectively).

fsPAG-EMSAs
for c-di-GMP Riboswitch on the
96-Plex fsPAG
Having established the optimized fsPAG conditions, the 96-plex fsPAG-EMSAs
were applied in high-throughput detection of binding of the Vc2 aptamer
to c-di-GMP. On the basis of previous in-chip EMSAs as well as previously
characterized Vc2 binding rates,35 the
expected interconversion rate between bound and unbound RNA is slower
than the rate of electromigration, indicating that the EMSAs will
resolve the binding-induced conformation change into two distinct
bands. The separate bands visualized in the slow interconversion regime
allow for the Kd or a standard curve of
the system to be calculated by the relative intensity of each peak.36

To analyze ligand binding to the Vc2 aptamer,
we constructed a 96-plex 20% T 3.3% C fsPAG for high-throughput
riboswitch fsPAG-EMSAs (Figure 6A). The array has 9 mm horizontal well-to-well spacing and 9 mm lane-to-lane
distance such that a standard multichannel pipet provides a suitable
macro-to-micro interface. The binding reactions contained 1 μM
RNA and 0–900 nM c-di-GMP using 500 nM of TI* as an internal
standard. On the basis of the high affinity of the Vc2 aptamer for
c-di-GMP (Kd ∼ 11 pM),35 the high RNA concentration used here results
in the generation of a standard curve rather than a Kd curve, which would require the concentration of one
reagent to be below the Kd. Electrophoresis
was performed for 2.5 min followed by fluorescence scanning of the
array. The observed mobility shifts demonstrate the successful application
of 96 parallel EMSAs in <3 min (Figure 6A). The ligand bound and unbound riboswitch were resolved within
half the axial length of a unit, leaving room for further improvement
in array density. Figure 6B reports the time
evolution of the separation resolution between the unbound and the
c-di-GMP-bound RNA, where the SR exceeds 0.5 from 2 min.

Figure 6 High-throughput fsPAG-EMSAs riboswitch. (A) Fluorescence
images of c-di-GMP riboswitch EMSAs on a 96-plex fsPAG. Vc2 RNA (1 μM) was incubated with increasing concentrations
of c-di-GMP (0–900 nM) and the binding reactions were assayed
using TI* (500 nM) as the internal standard. The arrow points in the E-field direction. (B) SR monitoring showed mobility shift
was resolvable at 2 min. (C) Normalized intensity of bound RNA increases
with c-di-GMP concentration (R2 = 0.9893).
Insets zooms in the fluorescence micrographs of RNA separation.

As shown in Figure 6C, the fluorescence
intensity of the bound RNA band increases as the c-di-GMP concentration
in the sample increases linearly (R2 =
0.9893). Note that, for each concentration point, 12 repeats were
averaged to improve the assay precision, yielding a standard error
of less than 0.07 for all concentrations. The fsPAG-EMSA
of 96 units in 10 min (5–6 min of setup and loading +3 min
separation) yielded a throughput of ∼10 data/min as compared
to ∼0.3 data/min17 for serially
loaded, in-chip microfluidic EMSAs and ∼0.01 data/min17 for slab PAGE-based EMSAs (17 h for 10 lanes).

Conclusion
To afford a capacity for concurrent operation
of electrophoretic
mobility shift assays, we explored fsPAG structures
seated on an open planar polymer substrate. The open architecture
allows for ready pipetting of a macroscale sample into microfluidic
sample wells as well as compatibility with postseparation sample manipulation.
To adapt the fsPAG for riboswitch EMSAs in high conductivity
run buffers, we studied three major design aspects of the device,
including (i) the dependence of EMSAs performance on sample well electrical
properties (40%–100% loading of the sample well to maximize
SR), (ii) the interplay between the fsPAG structure
geometry and run buffer recipe, with the time dependent electrical
properties of the system (100 μm fsPAG in 1×
TBMK containing 20% glycerol yields the highest electrical stability),
and (iii) the unit-to-unit variation across the large-format fsPAG array and strategies for mitigation of variability
(2 cm away from electrodes). Going forward we plan to further extend
the fsPAG-EMSAs platform beyond its current capabilities.
For instance, the present platform shows poor performance for electrophoresis
times >3 min. For assays that require substantially longer separation
times (>5 min), we are investigating a semienclosed fsPAG structure, which retains the facile open format while potentially
providing longer separation duration. Additionally, the cumbersome
manual loading process significantly limits the overall throughput
of the assay (∼5 min loading out of 10 min total assay). Automation
of fsPAGE loading with robotic sample loading systems
(<2 min loading) will likely further advance the screening capacity
and impact of quantitative, precision EMSAs.

A pilot study of
96-plex fsPAG-EMSAs for the Vc2
c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer binding reactions were demonstrated with
linearity observed in a ligand concentration titration study. We envision
that the improved detection sensitivity of the assay will allow Kd measurement for high-affinity interaction
(Kd < 1 nM), and future studies will
seek to harness the open gel structure to perform postseparation staining
and signal amplification, further improving the detection sensitivity.
Taken together, the streamlined yet powerful fsPAG-EMSAs
offer a promising platform for rapid binding reaction analyses and
support a molecular binding screening assay in a quantitative, high-throughput,
and reliable manner.
