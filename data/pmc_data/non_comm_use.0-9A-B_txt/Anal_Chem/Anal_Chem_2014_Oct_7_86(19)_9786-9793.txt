The use of biotherapeutics, such
as monoclonal antibodies, has
markedly increased in recent years. It is thus essential that biotherapeutic
production pipelines are as efficient as possible. For the production
process, one of the major concerns is the propensity of a biotherapeutic
antibody to aggregate. In addition to reducing bioactive material
recovery, protein aggregation can have major effects on drug potency
and cause highly undesirable immunological effects. It is thus essential
to identify processing conditions which maximize recovery while avoiding
aggregation. Heat resistance is a proxy for long-term aggregation
propensity. Thermal stability assays are routinely performed using
various spectroscopic and scattering detection methods. Here, we evaluated
the potential of macro attenuated total reflection Fourier transform
infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging as a novel method for the
high-throughput thermal stability assay of a monoclonal antibody.
This chemically specific visualization method has the distinct advantage
of being able to discriminate between monomeric and aggregated protein.
Attenuated total reflection is particularly suitable for selectively
probing the bottom of vessels, where precipitated aggregates accumulate.
With focal plane array detection, we tested 12 different buffer conditions
simultaneously to assess the effect of pH and ionic strength on protein
thermal stability. Applying the Finke model to our imaging kinetics
allowed us to determine the rate constants of nucleation and autocatalytic
growth. This analysis demonstrated the greater stability of our immunoglobulin
at higher pH and moderate ionic strength, revealing the key role of
electrostatic interactions. The high-throughput approach presented
here has significant potential for analyzing the stability of biotherapeutics
as well as any other biological molecules prone to aggregation.

==== Body
In 2011,
sales of 40 therapeutic
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) accounted for $45 billion, around 5%
of the global drug market.1,2 Currently, there are
more than 350 mAbs in clinical trials and 60% of new patent applications
for drugs are biotherapeutics.3 However,
there are a number of challenges to the production of these drugs
in a suitable state for delivery to patients. One key issue is the
propensity of the proteins to nonspecifically aggregate during expression,
isolation, final formulation, and storage. Protein aggregation reduces
bioactive material yields and can have major effects on drug potency.
Protein aggregates can also provoke highly undesirable immunological
effects such as anaphylactic shock.4−8

Protein aggregation can occur in one of two ways: through
chemical
aggregation by formation of new covalent bonds or by physical association.
Chemical aggregation is commonly a result of nonspecific disulfide
bond formation,9,10 although other chemical modifications
such as deamination can also increase aggregation propensity.11 Physical aggregation is considered to be caused
by the formation of partially unfolded intermediates. The partial
unfolding exposes hydrophobic regions, usually buried in the core
of the protein, which are much more prone to nucleate aggregation.
Many factors can affect the aggregation state of proteins including
protein structure and environmental factors such as temperature, pH,
and concentration.12 Temperatures of 40
to 70 °C typically result in loss of protein activity due to
protein unfolding and aggregation.13 Since
the probability of protein denaturation increases with temperature,14 heat resistance is indicative of long-term stability
at storage temperatures.15 Hence, heat
is routinely used as a source of stress for assessing the thermal
stability of protein using a range of detection methods.

There
are a number of methods available for identifying protein
aggregation including size exclusion chromatography (SEC),16,17 negative stain electron microscopy,18 multiangle light scattering,19 and sedimentation
velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) and flow field flow
fractionation20 as well as the ultracentrifugation
sedimentation dispersity assay combining ultracentrifugation and SDS-PAGE
analysis of high concentration (10 mg/mL) protein samples.21 However, none of these techniques are able to monitor the aggregation
process in situ.

Using only visible light, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) is a nondamaging
laboratory technique which can detect protein aggregation over a wide
range of length scales,22,23 but measurements are
restricted to a narrow concentration range and are also time-consuming.24 In dynamic scanning fluorescence (DSF), the
fluorescence of specially designed dyes can be used to specifically
probe protein domains during protein unfolding and subsequent aggregation.25 Although DSF is very sensitive and high-throughput,26 measurements are indirect and quantification
of aggregates is therefore challenging.

Highly sensitive to
protein secondary structure, circular dichroism
(CD) can detect subtle conformation changes occurring during protein
unfolding and subsequent aggregation.27 Despite being compatible with a wide pH range, the buffer used must
be transparent in the far-UV and data collection is also slow.

Vibrational spectroscopy techniques such as Raman and infrared
spectroscopy provide information on protein secondary structure based
on protein molecular vibrations absorbing at specific frequencies.
Although Raman spectroscopy informs on the protein secondary structure
in solution and can be performed through glass vessels, fluorescence
often interferes with the signal and quantification can be challenging.28 The measurement times in Raman spectroscopy
are usually much longer compared to infrared spectroscopy, important
for studying dynamic systems. Infrared spectroscopy does not suffer
from fluorescence baseline distortions and has the further advantage
that the strong absorption of infrared light by proteins results in
high signal-to-noise spectra collected in seconds for fast kinetic
measurements.22,29 Folded, unfolded, and aggregated
protein samples give characteristic FT-IR spectra; thus, this method
is particularly well suited for the detection of heat induced aggregates.22,27,30−32

The main
limitation of FT-IR spectroscopy for probing aqueous solution
is the strong absorption of water which overlaps with the protein
amide bands causing aqueous samples thicker than several micrometers
to saturate the absorption in the mid infrared range.33,34 Using a high refractive index infrared transparent internal reflection
element (IRE) can help to solve this issue. If directed at an angle
of incidence larger than the critical angle as defined by Snell’s
law, the infrared beam will be internally reflected, generating an
emerging evanescent wave.35 When a sample
is placed in close contact with the IRE, only a thin layer is probed
by the evanescent wave through the attenuated total reflection (ATR)
without suffering from H2O absorption saturation.36,37 Aggregates smaller than 100 nm are typically soluble; once they
grow larger, however, they start to precipitate.38 ATR has thus the additional advantage of probing the bottom
surface layer of aqueous solutions where protein adsorbs and aggregates
concentrate due to precipitation.39,40

Although
external modules allow the automation of spectra collection,41 conventional infrared spectroscopy is low-throughput
as only one sample can be measured at a time. However, spectral output
can be dramatically increased by using focal plane array (FPA) detectors
which allow spectroscopic imaging by simultaneously collecting a thousand
spectra in one measurement. The use of ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging
for high-throughput analysis of many samples was first introduced
for studies of polymer/drug formulations.42,43 Applications of ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging to biological systems
has been proposed for studying multiple protein solutions44 and have been recently reviewed.36,37 Using ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging, protein crystallization has
been monitored under various solvent conditions simultaneously45 while protein adsorption and crystallization
was studied under a gradient of surface properties.46 The use of a microscope allowed the detection of protein
crystal seeds as small as 6 μm.47

For these combined reasons, we developed a high-throughput
thermal
stability assay based on ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging. Because
immunoglobulin G (IgG) is a widely used biotherapeutic and is prone
to aggregation,28 we chose IgG gamma 4
as a model system to demonstrate the applicability of ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic
imaging for the study of the heat induced aggregation kinetic. Since
the size of aggregates are much smaller than the diffraction limit
of infrared light, a macro ATR-FT-IR imaging system with a large field
of view45 was employed. The thermal stability
of 12 samples with different buffer conditions could thus be assessed
in a single experiment. This allowed the screening of the harsh conditions
typically experienced by therapeutic antibodies during the isolation
process. Conveniently, the 1.4 mm wide wells designed for this study
could be loaded by common laboratory pipetting.

The results
obtained by this high-throughput imaging approach showed
that the aggregation kinetic follows a sigmoidal function. The screening
of different pH and ionic strength conditions revealed that IgG4 is
less stable around the protein’s isoelectric point, as reported
by previous studies.28,48 The kinetic also revealed that
insoluble aggregates are formed faster at moderate salt concentration
than at low and high ionic strength. These results stressed the impact
of electrostatic interactions on the stability of the IgG in solution.
Hence, our novel screening method can investigate the effect of these
interactions by mainly probing the formation of insoluble protein
aggregates under a range of buffer conditions simultaneously.

Materials
and Methods
Immunoglobulin G Sample Preparation
Glutamine Synthetase
Chinese Hamster Ovary (GS-CHO) cell lines that express the chimeric
B72.3 immunoglobulin G gamma 4 (cB72.3 IgG4) were provided by Lonza
(Lonza Biologics, Basel, Switzerland). Cultures were maintained in
CD-CHO medium (Invitrogen, UK) with 25 M MSX (Sigma, UK) at 36.5 °C
with 8% CO2 humidified air while shaking on an orbital
shaker at 140 rpm. Cells were routinely subcultured every 3 or 4 days
with a seeding cell density of 2 × 105 cells/mL, with
batch cultures conducted in 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks with a working volume
of 300 mL. The cB72.3 IgG4 is secreted into the culture media, and
thus, the spent media presented a source of protein for further studies.
The IgG concentration in the different media samples was quantified
by ELISA (Montgomery, TX, US) and UV–vis spectroscopy using
a Nanodrop Lite system (Thermo, Wilmington, DE, USA) prior to storage
at −80 °C until further use.

For isolation of the
IgG, the media samples were defrosted, prior to filtration through
a 0.45 μm filter disk to remove aggregates and other large particles.
The media containing the protein was then desalted using a HiPrep
26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated
with Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Subsequently, the protein
solution was loaded onto a HiTrap Q FF prepacked with Q Sepharose
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with Buffer A and the bound
proteins eluted using a buffer elution gradient from 0 to 1000 mM
of NaCl. Thereafter, the protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR
10/30 size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences) with the Buffer A. The SEC chromatogram presented in the Supporting Information is strongly indicative
that the purified IgG 4 is monodisperse. As a final step, the protein
was further desalted using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) with type I demineralized water (resistivity at 25
°C > 10 MΩ·cm). The purified protein was then concentrated
by centrifugal filtration using a molecular weight cut off of 100
kDa to 2 mg/mL and divided into aliquots which were stored at −80
°C.

Experimental Setup
Infrared Spectroscopy Experimental
Setup
Infrared spectra
were measured using a Varian 670 spectrometer (Agilent Technologies,
Wokingham, UK) coupled to a Varian external large sample compartment.
The spectra presented in below were collected using an uncooled single
element DTGS detector with a diamond ATR accessory
Golden Gate (Specac, Orpington, UK). The macro ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic
images of the high-throughput grid were measured using a cooled MCT
focal plane array (FPA) displaying 128 by 128 elements.37 16 384 infrared spectra were thus collected
simultaneously. To reduce memory requirements, images were aggregated
to 64 by 64 by averaging groups of 4 pixels. Spectra were acquired
in continuous scan mode by coadding 32 scans at a 4 cm–1 spectral resolution, taking 135 s. Spectra were then truncated to
cover only the 4000 to 800 cm–1 range. The experimental
setup located in the large sample compartment of the spectrometer
is shown in Figure 1. It comprises a 20 mm
circular zinc selenide (ZnSe) single bounce internal reflection element
prism (PIKE Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). In this configuration,
the attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory allowed a 7 by 9.8
mm field of view for imaging studies46 and
a depth of penetration (dp) of 1.2 μm at 1600 cm–1 and at a 45° angle of incidence.49 The temperature of the ZnSe element was set using a nichrome wire
based heating controller. The ZnSe top surface was covered by a Sylgard
184 poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomeric substrate (Dow Corning
Corporation, Midland, MI, USA) cast on top of a 12 well PMMA 3D printed
master (Shapeways, New York, USA). The PDMS wells were sealed with
a 2 mm PDMS film mounted onto a laser cut 13 mm thick PMMA plate which
was bolted onto the steel bottom plate. Each well is a 1.4 by 1.4
by 1.5 mm deep rounded box holding up to 2.6 μL of solution.

Figure 1 Cut through
schematic of the experimental setup comprised the ZnSe
internal reflection element, the PDMS well grid, the PDMS lid, and
the PMMA top plate.

Experimental Procedure
Because the infrared beam is
spread over thousands of detecting elements in an FPA detector when
performing ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging, each pixel receives less
infrared light, resulting in a lower signal-to-noise ratio than can
be obtained using a single element detector. Although a germanium
crystals can be used over a wider pH range, ZnSe was preferred because
it offered a ∼5 times greater absorbance of the spectra bands.
The pH was thus kept between pH 5 and 10; measurements were restricted
to this range to avoid prism degradation. For each sample, 1.5 μL
of a 2 mg/mL IgG 4 stock solution was mixed with 0.75 μL of
40 mM phosphate buffer pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 and 0.75 μL of
sodium chloride at 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, or 4000 mM. When ignoring
contributions from protein charges, the resulting solutions had ionic
strengths of between 0.041 and 1.01 M. The sample solution constituents
were subsequently mixed by brief centrifugation for a few seconds
before loading a 2.2 μL aliquot in each well. Once all samples
were loaded, a background image was collected at room temperature
(25 °C) to calculate the absorbance. To prevent evaporation,
wells were then hermetically sealed and the temperature was rapidly
increased to 60 °C before the next 90 or so images were collected
over approximately 2.5 h.

Data Analysis
Raw interferograms
were collected using
Resolution Pro 5.2 (Agilent Technologies Ltd., Santa Clara, CA, USA),
and all subsequent data analysis operations were performed by MATLAB
(MatWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Fourier transformed single beam data
were offset to zero thereafter using the average value between 700
and 600 cm–1. The single beam intensity between
1900 and 1850 cm–1 was also set to a value of 1
since no absorption should have been observed in this region. An offset
using the 1900 to 1850 cm–1 region was then performed
before correcting for the penetration depth variation depending on
the wavelength.35 Since no absorbance variation
is expected between the PDMS wells, these regions were selected to
offset the spectra of the images over time. The offset absorbance
values for the pixels in the gaps were interpolated linearly to reduce
the signal fluctuation between each spectroscopic image captured.
Afterward, spectra with pixel positions corresponding to the bottom
of each of the 12 wells were averaged. To reduce the spectra to a
single variable proportional to the local protein concentration at
the bottom layer of the wells, the amide II band was integrated between
1590 and 1495 cm–1.

Results and Discussion
ATR-FT-IR
Spectroscopy
To assess the potential of ATR-FT-IR
spectroscopy for thermal stability assays, the behavior of our IgG
was monitored with single element detection (DTGS) offering high spectrum
reproducibility. Since previous studies have reported distinct infrared
absorption for native protein and aggregates,22,27,30−32 we first tested the
ability of ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy to discriminate between native IgG4
and protein aggregates. To obtain a high absorbance spectrum and assign
bands without the contribution of water, IgG solutions without buffer
salt were simply dried under vacuum to cast a protein film onto the
measuring surface of the diamond IRE.

Represented by the blue
curve in Figure 2a, the IgG sample has an amide
I band peaking at 1637 cm–1, representative of proteins
with a secondary structure comprising mainly β-sheets,50 which is the predominant secondary structure
as determined by X-ray crystallography.48 At lower frequencies, the amide II and III bands peaked at 1533
and 1220 cm–1, respectively. In between, the infrared
spectra of the pure IgG also gave rise to four maxima at 1434, 1388,
1332, and 1301 cm–1 assigned to protein side chain
vibration modes.50−52 Additional bands observed at 1066 cm–1 were assigned to polysaccharide because of the known glycosylated
state of the IgG.53 These IgG band assignments
are listed in Table 1.

Schematics illustrating the native IgG (green box) and the increased
local concentration in the volume probed by ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy
caused by heat induced protein aggregates precipitation (red box).

Because the hydrogen bonding strength
affects the wavenumber of
the amide C=O groups, the wavenumber position of the amide
I band is sensitive to the hydrogen bonding network difference between
β-sheets in native protein and aggregates.59−61 The red trace
in Figure 2a shows the ATR-FT-IR spectrum of
a dried IgG film obtained from heat induced precipitated protein aggregates.
Spectra were normalized using the 1350 to 1300 cm–1 region which is independent of the protein conformation in order
to compensate for any concentration difference between measurements.
The difference spectrum (light green) shows a sharp negative peak
at 1637 cm–1 as well as a positive peak at 1624
cm–1 indicating the loss of native β-sheets
and gain of intermolecular β-sheet aggregates.30,31,55−57 In addition,
the positive peaks at 1666 and 1695 cm–1 suggest
that aggregated proteins have a higher proportion of turns and antiparallel
β-sheets.50 In the amide II region,
the negative peak at 1549 cm–1 and the positive
component at 1503 cm–1 indicate disordered structure
and aggregated β-sheet, respectively.59−61 These differences
corroborate conformation discriminating power of the technique.

At 1 mg/mL, the ATR-FT-IR spectrum of solution (dark green curve)
is barely distinguishable from the spectrum of the phosphate buffer
(blue curve), Figure 2b. As shown, protein
bands are only clearly identifiable once the buffer is subtracted.
The low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) suggests that this concentration
is close to the detection limit. Depending on their solvent, proteins
will undergo a denaturation transition upon heating, resulting in
greater backbone mobility.14 The protein
thus unfolds and aggregates through the formation of nonspecific hydrophobic
interactions or anomalous disulfide bridges.10 As the aggregates grow larger than 100 nm, they typically become
insoluble and precipitate.38 The SNR of
ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy can therefore be improved by the heat induced
precipitation of protein aggregates concentrating at the probed bottom
layer as illustrated in Figure 2c.

After
heating a sealed 1 mg/mL IgG solution to 60 °C, the
red curve of Figure 2b shows a ∼5-fold
increase in the local protein concentration. As a result of the higher
concentration, the IgG main vibration bands become clearly identifiable
in the difference spectrum presented in fuchsia (Figure 2b). Other spectroscopic techniques probing sample bulk such
as CD or UV–vis would lose signal upon protein precipitation.
This feature makes ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy particularly well suited
for protein thermal stability assays.27 Since the concentration of the protein increases in the bottom of
the wells where it has been probed, it was impossible to deconvolute
the amount of soluble native protein in bulk solution undergoing denaturation
and denatured protein precipitating into the probed volume. The later
phenomenon should be predominant, since we observed a many fold increase
in protein absorbance signal. The single reflection ATR approach required
for imaging results in lower sensitivity compared to multireflection
ATR. Hence, we only determined the total protein content in the probed
volume instead of attempting to quantify the protein conformation
using the second derivative or peak deconvolution.

Noncovalent
interactions such as hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals,
hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions govern the stability of
proteins in solution.63 Since these interactions
appear to be highly context dependent,64 predicting their effect is challenging. The protein net charge can
be affected by the pH of the buffer as the net charge varies with
gained or lost protons (H+). Most proteins are less stable
and tend to form aggregates around the pH at which the protein carries
no net electrical charge (pI).65 Since
ions can shield side chain charges,64,66 controlling
the buffer ionic strength is equality important. Because the charge
distribution also depends on protein conformation, the pI can only
be determined accurately by experimental titration. To find the optimum
buffer conditions for protein purification, storage, or handling,
high-throughput screening assays are therefore highly favorable.67

Unlike dynamic scanning fluorimetry (DSF)
performed in qPCR instruments
which can probe many samples in a single heating ramp,25 conventional ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy can only
probe one sample at a time. In contrast, mercury cadmium telluride
(MCT) focal plane array (FPA) detectors43,68,69 deliver high-throughput by allowing multiple samples
to be measured simultaneously. Using such FPA with its 128 by 128
pixels and a field of view of 7.0 mm by 9.8 mm, it was thus possible
to probe 12 sample wells simultaneously in this study.

ATR-FT-IR Spectroscopic
Imaging
Because of the interfering
water OH bending mode at 1636 cm–1, the amide II
bands offers the largest absorbance difference, providing a better
signal-to-noise ratio than the amide I band for ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic
imaging. Shortly after increasing the temperature suddenly to 60 °C,
the absorbance across the image does not vary much as spectra are
close to zero absorbance. However, after 2000 s (see Figure 3), the relative concentration at the bottom of the
well becomes much higher. It is also possible to observe that the
relative concentration is much higher for wells containing pH 5 than
those with pH 10, suggesting that more aggregates precipitated at
low pH.

Figure 3 ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic image generated using the amide II band
area after 2000 s. All the images collected during the thermal stability
assay are presented as a spectroscopic movie in the Supporting Information. The unit of the scale bar is integrated
absorbance in cm–1. The polygons represent the integrated
region of interest of each well. The field of view covered approximately
9.8 mm along the Y axis and 7.0 mm long the X axis.

Precipitation Kinetics
The pixels contained in the
12 color coded polygons shown in Figure 3 were
averaged together to obtain the one spectrum per well region for every
image collected at a 150 s interval. The absorbance difference of
the amide II band could thus be plotted as a function of time to easily
visualize the IgG aggregate precipitation kinetic. Following the abrupt
temperature rise to 60 °C, the absorbance of the amide II band
increased due to higher concentration at the bottom of the wells caused
by protein precipitation. Figure 4a shows two
examples of these aggregate precipitation kinetics, at pH 5 (light
blue) and pH 10 (dark orange). It is clear that protein precipitated
faster and resulted in a greater final amide II absorbance after 12 000
s at pH 5 than at pH 10. Because the cumulative distribution functions
for many common probability distributions are sigmoidal, these curves
are typically the result of a probabilistic mechanism.14 Such a profile is typical for heat induced protein
denaturation and aggregation.14,70 Fitting such kinetic
data using a sigmoidal function can thus reduce the data set to a
few informative parameters to quickly assess the effect of different
buffer conditions on the protein thermal stability.

cm–1) as a function of time for pH 5 (light blue)
and 10 (dark orange) with 31 mM NaCl. The solid lines represent the
result of the Finke-Watzky model fitting. (b) t1/2 as a function of the pH and ionic strength. (c) k2[A]0 as a function
of the pH and ionic strength. (d) 1/k1 as a function of the pH and ionic strength.

Several kinetic models are sigmoidal, but it is preferable
to choose
one which provides physically relevant quantities. This is why we
selected the Finke-Watzky model, which was previously used to describe
protein aggregation kinetics.70−73 Also known as the Minimal/“Ockham’s
Razor” model, it assumes a two-step mechanism whereas the native
protein slowly nucleates Amonomer → Baggregate at the same time as the aggregates
grow autocatalytically Amonomer + Baggregate → 2Baggregate. The rate of native protein depletion −d[A]/dt is dependent on the rate constant of the nucleation
(k1) and autocatalytic growth (k2). By integrating over t,
the concentration of the protein aggregates [B]t is given by72 1  

By fitting
our kinetic data using eq 1, we
were able to calculate the initial concentration [A]0 as well as the rate constants k1 and k2 for the buffer conditions
tested. For all kinetic fitting, we calculated a median coefficient
of determination R2 of 0.94, indicating
that this sigmoidal model can accurately describe the aggregate precipitation
mechanism. In Figure 4a, fitted curves are
presented with solid lines. Such high coefficients of determination suggest that ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic
imaging can be as informative as other techniques for assessing the
thermal stability of multiple protein solutions simultaneously. Since
1/k1 is proportional to the induction
period tind or lag before the growth,
this metric can inform on the nucleation period.72 Other simple sigmoidal models often use the X and Y positions of the inflection point at the
half process as fitting parameters. To calculate the position of the
inflection point from k1, k2 and [A]0, the time of the
midpoint t1/2 was calculated using eq 2. 2  

The t1/2 calculated for the aggregation
kinetics presented in Figure 4a is shown as dashed lines. Given in seconds, t1/2 has the advantage of being independent from the absolute
absorbance value and thus the initial protein concentration in the
wells. Another concentration independent parameter is the normalized
slope of the curve at the inflection point, which is then given by
eq 3. 3  k2 × [A]0 is thus given
in reciprocal time units such
as s–1.

Effect of Buffer Conditions
Using
our experimental
setup for the high-throughput thermal stability screening assay, we
investigated the stability effect of the buffer on the IgG solution
for every combination of pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 and ionic strength
0.041, 0.072, 0.135, 0.26, 0.51, and 1.01 M. Unfortunately, pH lower
than 5 and higher than 10 could not be studied due to the stability
of the ZnSe IRE. For each of the 36 conditions tested, the data from
the kinetic was fitted with eq 2 to calculate t1/2 and k2A0.

Figure 4b shows
the aggregation half time t1/2 for the
1 mg/mL IgG solution under a range of pH and ionic strength buffer
conditions. Around the isoelectric point (pI), charges are neutralized,
making intermolecular interaction more favorable, typically resulting
in lower stability and solubility.65 Since
the pI of the IgG is between 5.5 and 6.0,74 it is known to be less stable at low pH.28 The smaller t1/2 values measured at
low pH by our thermal stability assay were thus expected.

The
effect of charge shielding on the thermal stability also needed
to be determined experimentally as it is highly system dependent and
can also depend on the salt bridge content.64,66 To test this effect of the thermal stability of our protein, we
varied the ionic strength by adding sodium chloride to the buffer.
At low pH, the ionic strength did not appear to affect the t1/2. At higher pH, the IgG carries a net negative
charge making the protein more susceptible to electrostatic interactions
and charge shielding. At pH 8 to 10, moderate salt concentrations
(0.135 and 0.26 M) appear to be less stabilizing than low (0.041 and
0.072 M) or high salt concentration (0.51 and 1.01 M). Although the
effect of salt is less marked than the pH, the result is interesting
as it indicates that the ionic strength does not have a monotonic
effect on the thermal stability of the protein. With smaller t1/2, the lower stability could be the result
of a net attractive potential when charges are optimally shielded
at moderate ionic strength.75 Such a net
attractive potential could result from the remaining van der Waals
interactions. At extreme salt concentration, the remaining electrostatic
interactions could thus still overcome the attractive interaction
and stabilize the protein in solution.

k2[A]0 was also calculated
to evaluate the relative rate at which the rapid growth of the aggregates
occurs. Figure 4c shows that the relative aggregation
rate is roughly the inverse of t1/2. It
is the most rapid at low pH and 0.26 to 0.51 M ionic strength while
the slope of the kinetic is the smallest at either low or high salt
concentration solution or high pH. This result was expected since
the t1/2 and k2[A]0 are both dependent on the autocatalytic growth rate k2.

In contrast, tind = 1/k1 shown in Figure 4d does not tell
the same story. The lower value of 1/k1 indicates that nucleation occurs much faster at low pH and ionic
strength. At high pH, however, the nucleation rate is comparable across
the ionic strength range studied. This observation implies that the
charge shielding effect observed at high pH has a greater effect on
aggregate growth than the nuclei formation rate. By allowing both
measurement of protein precipitation in multiple samples in situ and
calculation of rate constants, this ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging
assay could provide valuable new insights into nonspecific interactions
causing undesirable precipitation of protein aggregates.

Conclusions
By taking advantage of FPA detection, this study represents the
first example of a high-throughput thermal stability assay based on
ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging. Tested using a common immunoglobulin
G, this experimental setup allowed the measurement of 12 different
buffer conditions simultaneously, allowing studies that are impossible
by conventional infrared spectroscopy. In addition, our approach could
be extended to standard size 96 well plates with the appropriate magnification.43 With its high-throughput and direct distinct
signal measurement, ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging offers many advantages
over other techniques such as DSF, DSC, and CD to assess the thermal
stability of protein in solution. The precipitation of insoluble aggregates
had the benefit of increasing by several fold the local concentration
and thus markedly improving the SNR when using ATR. Since the infrared
absorption signature of protein aggregates is distinct from the native
IgG,29 these experiments allowed us to
selectively monitor the formation of insoluble IgG aggregates. Another
advantage of using FPA was the opportunity of using the constant regions
between the wells as internal reference for the offset of the image
absorbance values. With this approach, ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging
provided high quality kinetic data of protein aggregate precipitation.
By fitting this data to a two-step kinetic model,73 the obtained data from these precipitation experiments
agreed with a well-established model for protein aggregation, which
includes a nucleation and an autocatalytic growth phase. By testing
a wide range of pH and ionic strength conditions, we found that IgG
4 is more stable at high pH but also at either low or high salt concentrations.
A high-throughput ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic imaging study of thermal
stability assays could thus be considered as a powerful addition to
the techniques employed for the direct investigation of protein aggregation in situ. This tool could help address one of the main challenges
associated with the development of new therapeutics monoclonal antibody
and also any other class of aggregation prone proteins.
