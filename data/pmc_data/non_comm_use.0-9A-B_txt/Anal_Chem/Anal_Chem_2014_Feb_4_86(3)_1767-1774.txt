Signal amplification by reversible
exchange (SABRE) of a substrate
and parahydrogen at a catalytic center promises to
overcome the inherent insensitivity of magnetic resonance. In order
to apply the new approach to biomedical applications, there is a need
to develop experimental equipment, in situ quantification
methods, and a biocompatible solvent. We present results detailing
a low-field SABRE polarizer which provides well-controlled experimental
conditions, defined spins manipulations, and which allows in situ detection of thermally polarized and hyperpolarized
samples. We introduce a method for absolute quantification of hyperpolarization
yield in situ by means of a thermally polarized reference.
A maximum signal-to-noise ratio of ∼103 for 148
μmol of substance, a signal enhancement of 106 with
respect to polarization transfer field of SABRE, or an absolute 1H-polarization level of ≈10–2 is
achieved. In an important step toward biomedical application, we demonstrate 1H in situ NMR as well as 1H and 13C high-field MRI using hyperpolarized pyridine (d3) and 13C nicotinamide in pure and 11% ethanol
in aqueous solution. Further increase of hyperpolarization yield,
implications of in situ detection, and in
vivo application are discussed.

==== Body
Magnetic
resonance (MR) is an
invaluable tool which finds application in many research fields despite
its inherent insensitivity. This situation holds true even when employing
the strongest available superconducting magnets which exceed the earth’s
magnetic field strength by 100 000 times. This is because only
a miniscule fraction of the nuclear spins present in a sample contribute
positively to the detected MR response when their alignment is thermally
controlled. For the most commonly analyzed spin, 1H (spin 1/2), this is, in effect, the population difference
that exists across addressable spin states and amounts to only 3 spins
per million per Tesla (T). The situation is far worse for all other
stable nuclei because their interactions with the magnetic field are
even weaker. As a consequence, while NMR is an essential tool in the
analytical chemist’s arsenal, there is a significant need to
improve the detection limits which will open up many new areas of
analysis and diagnosis.

Hyperpolarization (hyp) methods can
be used to address the poor
thermal distribution of spins and have been discussed and employed
for some time. Common sources of such hyperpolarized spin order include
polarized light,1−4 electron spin,5−8 and parahydrogen (pH2).9−15 Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is currently one of the most
frequently used methods, due to its flexibility in hyperpolarizing
a wide range of molecules as well as its commercial availability and
well-developed experimental approach.

Utilization of pH2, the nuclear spin-singlet
of dihydrogen, was suggested as a potential route to MR signal enhancement
in the 1980s, where “pH2 and synthesis
allow dramatically enhanced nuclear alignment” (PASADENA),
“pH2 induced polarization”
(PHIP), and “adiabatic longitudinal transport after dissociation
engenders net alignment” (ALTADENA) reflect the early approaches.9−12 These methods rely on adding the spin order of a single pH2 molecule into a target dihydrogen acceptor,
by means of hydrogenation.

A wide range of studies have been
reported that use this approach
to probe catalysis16−18 and support biomedical in vivo imaging.19−23 Some of these results have employed polarization transfer to longer-lived 13C nuclei by means of r.f. sequence application.14,24 The quality control and equipment necessary for in vivo experimentation has been described, but the technique is not yet
available as a “push-button” method.25−28 Recently, the detection and quantification
of 13C-polarization achieved via such a transfer at a B0 field of ≈50 mT29 and steps toward a catalyst-free pH2-hyperpoalrization30 was presented and this can be considered as
an important step in moving toward routine and reliable biomedical
application.

In 2009 it was demonstrated that pH2 does not need to actually be incorporated into the
target. Instead, pH2 and a substrate were
brought into reversible
interaction at a metal center. When this process occurs in an appropriate
magnetic field, BS, strong hyperpolarization
is observed and this was termed SABRE.31,32 SABRE stands
for signal amplification by reversible exchange and, although a method
in its infancy, its potential to achieve rapid hyperpolarization has
resulted in significant research interest. Published work has focused
thus far on demonstrating its potential for chemical analysis.33−35 Typically, SABRE has been reported to occur in a methanol solution,
after shaking a sample to introduce pH2 in a stray field (∼5 × 10–3 T). Upon
transfer into a high-field magnet, hyperpolarized signals have been
observed in the free substrate. This process is illustrated in Figure 1, which demonstrates the simplicity of SABRE. Methanol,
however, is neither biocompatible nor suited for in vivo measurements.

Figure 1 Schematic of SABRE: The pure and NMR-invisible spin order
of pH2 is transferred into observable
hyperpolarization
of the pyridine (py) target during their temporary contact, in low
field, mediated by the metal complex. The red arrows indicate how
spin-order equilibration leads to hyperpolarization in the ortho-,
meta- and para-1H-nuclei of the free pyridine receptor.

Accurate experimental conditions,
the absolute quantification of
the level of hyperpolarization in situ, and biocompatible
solvents are important milestones for SABRE toward biomedical application,
which have not yet been addressed in the literature. In this contribution,
we will detail the following: (i) a SABRE polarizer which provides
well-controlled experimental conditions and enables reproducible and
repeatable in situ detection in various solvents,
(ii) a method for absolute quantification of in situ hyperpolarization at low field, and also following transfer to high
field, and (iii) NMR of SABRE hyperpolarized pyridine at Earth-, SABRE-,
and high-field, as well as MRI of 13C-nicotinamide in pure
ethanol and an ethanol–water mixture.

Materials and Methods
ParaHydrogen
pH2 with
a purity of >95%, as described elsewhere, was used in
this study.36 A volume of 3 L of pH2 at a pressure of ≈35 bar was produced
and stored in an aluminum cylinder prior to completion of SABRE.

Chemistry
The SABRE catalyst reported37 and recently investigated further38 Ir(1,5-cyclooctadiene) (1,3-bis (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) imidazolium)
Cl (MW = 639.67 g/mol) was employed to polarize pyridine (py, MW =
79.1 g/mol, Carl Roth, Germany). Catalyst and substrate were dissolved
in (a) 99.8% methanol-d4 (Carl Roth, Germany),
(b) 100% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), or (c) 100% ethanol followed by
dilution with water in the ratio 1:9.

13C-Nicotinamide
Route 1
13C-nicotinic acid (744 mg,
6 mmol) was added to SOCl2 (2 mL) heated to 80 °C
for 2 h and then allowed to cool. The
excess SOCl2 was removed in vacuo, and
the resulting acid chloride was added dropwise to a cooled (0 °C)
conc. ammonia solution (5 mL). The solution was subsequently concentrated in vacuo and the crude product purified via column chromatography
(10% MeOH in DCM) to afford the product as an off-white powder (280
mg, 38%).

13C-Nicotinamide Route 2
From
methyl-13C-nicotinoate, 600 mg, 3.89 mmol was added to
a solution of MeOH (5 mL) and conc. ammonia solution (5 mL), and the
reaction stirred for 18 h at 20 °C. The solution was subsequently
concentrated in vacuo and the crude product purified
via column chromatography (10% MeOH in DCM) to afford the product
as an off white powder (362 mg, 76%).

In Situ and Field-Cycling Polarizer
The solution composed of solvent,
catalyst, and substrate was placed
in a reaction chamber that was manufactured from polysulfone and withstands
a pressure of 15 bar (Figure 2b,c, length 8
cm, radius 2.75 cm, inner volume 13.3 mL).27 PTFE tubing was connected to the ports of the reaction chamber to
allow pH2 injection, gas venting, and
solution transfer, controlled by electromagnetic solenoid valves.
The chamber was placed into the low-field NMR or Earth’s field
cycling setup as described below. To allow shaking of the chamber,
a vortexer was placed outside of the B0 coil and connected to the reaction chamber’s holder (Figure 2d,e) using an acrylic rod.

coil (f0 ≈ 230 kHz), (b,c) typical
reaction chambers, (d,e) reaction chamber holders, (f,g) mixing device,
(h) electromagnet used to establish a uniform and well-defined polarization
transfer field BS.

In Situ Low-Field NMR
We modified
the recently presented prototype for NMR at very low fields40 for quantitative in situ detection
of thermally and hyperpolarized samples. A static magnetic field was
generated by the illustrated, numerically optimized, resistive solenoid
(Figure 2h, length 35 cm, radius 6 cm, two
layers of copper wire r = 0.5 mm, additional windings
on the ends to improve homogeneity). Simulations predicted a very
high level of homogeneity within the area of the reactor as the difference
between Bmax and Bmin is only ≈8.6 × 10–7 T. The
magnet was powered by a low-noise battery-driven current controller.40

For signal excitation and detection, a
solenoid transmit-receive coil was constructed to fit around the reaction
chamber. (Figure 2a,b, f0 ≈ 230 and 270 kHz, 2.75 cm radius, 4.4 cm length,
280 μm wire diameter, capacitance 390 pF). Crossed diodes were
added in the transmission path for rapid passive switching between
transmission and receive. Excitation pulses were generated using a
digital-to-analog converter controlled by custom software (6251 USB,
National Instruments and Matlab, The Mathworks). The NMR signal was
detected in the same device, 1–2 ms after excitation.

The 1H NMR flip angle was adjusted as optimized signal
from deionized water at thermal equilibrium and 5.4 mT. The resulting
flip-angle error is estimated to 1°.40 The experimentally observed line widths vary between 10 and 45 Hz,
likely depending on the filling of the reactor. For SABRE, the reaction
chamber was held in the center of the magnet and was connected to
a commercial vortexer (Figure 2d,f) which allowed
for efficient gas mixing (optionally).

Field-Cycling NMR
Flip angles and field homogeneity
of the field-cycling NMR and MRI unit (Terra-Nova, Magritek, NZ) were
adjusted according to the MR signal of a water sample that was prepolarized
for 4 s at 20 mT. For hyperpolarization experiments, fresh pH2 was supplied for every acquisition to the
headspace of the reaction chamber (Figure 2c). The SABRE process was established under a transfer field, BS, that could be set between 0.5 and 24 mT and
held constant for 4 s. The BS field was
then turned off and the sample interrogated by a simple 90°-pulse-acquisition
experiment in the shimmed Earth’s field at ≈2.1 kHz
(50 μT). In view of the fact that there is a need to prepolarize
the nonhyperpolarized reference sample, an absolute quantification
of the hyperpolarized signal cannot easily be made in such a field
cycling device.

High-Field MRS and MRI
A glass vial
was filled with
water and placed in the MRI or NMR system for calibration (two Biospec,
70/20 Avance III for 1H MRS and 13C MRI or 400
MHz, 89 mm vertical bore DRX for 1H MRI, Bruker, Germany).
For SABRE, an appropriate solution was placed into the vial and sealed. pH2 was introduced into the solution through
either a Young’s valve or a syringe needle. After ≈10
s in a field of between 1 and 6.5 mT, the sample was introduced into
the high-field magnet and either nonlocalized spectra or MRI data
were recorded within seconds.

All proton images were acquired
using the RARE pulse sequence,41 a single-shot
method which allows for acquisition times shorter than or of the order
of 1 s. For the pyridine and pyridine-d3 images, methanol-d4 was employed as
the solvent and the acquisition parameters used were echo time (TE)
7.5 ms, field of view (FOV) 40 mm × 40 mm, slice thickness 2
mm, and acquisition matrix 64 × 64. The associated parameters
used to collect the 13C-nicotinamide image reported here
in methanol or ethanol solution were TE 7.5 ms, FOV 6 cm × 6
cm, slice thickness 30 mm, and acquisition matrix 32 × 32, zero-filled
to 128 × 128.

Quantification Methods
High-field
data were processed
using the manufacturer’s Paravision and Topspin package and
Matlab. The signal enhancement (η) and absolute polarization
yield (Phyp) for spectra was quantified
by comparing the integral of the hyperpolarized signal Shyp to the signal in thermal equilibrium Stherm of the sample, acquired with identical parameters
as shown in eq 1. For imaging, if the thermal
signal of the nonhyperpolarized sample was too low for direct detection,
the signal of a second sample was used as reference. However, quantification
of the absolute hyperpolarization yield is exacerbated by relaxation
weighting of the sequence and different relaxation properties of sample
and reference. Thus, in this work, we report an apparent enhancement
of contrast instead of absolute signal enhancement. 1  where Ptherm (1H, 7T) = 2.5 × 10–5.

A similar
problem presents itself for low-field NMR. It was pointed out before
that direct detection of MR signal at ≈10–3 T in a single acquisition is not possible but requires prepolarization
at much higher fields, as only 3 ppb of all spins effectively contribute
to the signal.42 Only recently, we presented
the detection of a thermally polarized MR signal at 10–3 T after a single excitation.40 The apparatus
described here improves on this by using reaction chambers and exploiting
dedicated transmit-receive coils fitted to the chamber. Even with
this equipment, however, the amount of nonhyperpolarized substrate
is far too low for its direct detection. Under these conditions, the
level of hyperpolarization was quantified by reference to the thermal
signal of a 0.74 M H2O sample. Of the 1.48 mol of protons
in this sample, 1/4 are invisible as they are
in the para-state43 and do not contribute
to the signal. Consequently, the signal arises for an effective 1.1
mol of protons. Area, line width, and peak height data were obtained
by fitting a Lorentzian function to the detected low-field resonances
(Matlab). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated by dividing
the height of the resonance at 230 kHz by the standard deviation of
the data between 216 and 228 kHz.

The area of the H2O reference spectrum in Figure 3 was quantified
as 104.7 au (NEX = 10 free-induction
decays, TR = 15 s, α = 90°, T1 (H2O, 5.4 mT) ≈ 2.7 s). The summed spectra, and
the mean of the individual spectra, exhibited a SNRNEX=10 of 88.9 and SNRNEX=1 of 31.4, respectively. Thus, in
thermal equilibrium at this field, the limit of detection (SNR = 2)
was ≈70 mmol of water protons, which corresponds to about 1
nmol of polarized spins.

Sum of 10 free induction decays (left) and real spectrum with fit
(right) of 0.74 mol of deionized H2O detected in thermal
equilibrium at B0 = 5.4mT (TR = 15 s,
fwhm = 45 Hz, SNR = 89).

The associated full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the line
of
the H2O sample were fwhmNEX=10 = 45 Hz and fwhmNEX=1 = 42 Hz, respectively. These data demonstrate a near
stable field homogeneity throughout the experiment, which accounts
for the 10% lower than expected SNR increase.

The 1H polarization in thermal equilibrium at 290 K
is 1.90 × 10–8 at 5.4 mT. This leads to the
following equations for signal enhancement (η) and absolute
polarization yield (eq 2). 2  where Shyp and Stherm are the area
of hyperpolarized and thermally
polarized resonances, NEX is number of excitations, and nA is the amount of substance.

At 5.4 mT, a 45 Hz
line-width equates to ≈200 ppm, which
is now 2 orders of magnitude above the typical chemical shift range
of 1H resonances. Consequently, the 1H resonances
for all molecules are collapsed into one peak during these measurements.
In the case of SABRE-derived magnetization in low field, the single
line is comprised of all the coherence order created by the simple
excitation pulse. Thus, even though significant polarization can be
detected, it cannot be attributed to an individual proton resonance.
Furthermore, any variation in phase across proton resonances, as is
typical in SABRE or PHIP, may cancel a portion of the detected signal.
The hyperpolarization level achieved for pyridine is therefore reported
per molecule as a whole, which holds five protons. The enhancement
of each of these hydrogen nuclei is known to vary in high field, in
both phase and magnitude, but are treated equally here because we
cannot resolve such effects in low field.

Results
In
Situ Detection and Quantification at Low
Field in Methanol
When a thermally polarized 148 μmol
sample of pyridine in 4.7 mL of methanol-d4 and 2 mM catalyst was monitored at 5.4 mT, no 1H signal
is observed, as was expected. However, when pH2 was utilized to activate the SABRE effect, a substantial
signal was observed indicative of strong enhancement. The SNR achieved
for the data in Figure 4 that was collected
with one acquisition was 1.67 × 103. Compared to the
fitted peak area of a H2O reference, a signal enhancement
value, ηhyp of 320 × 103 was estimated.
This corresponds to an absolute polarization level of ≈0.6%
(eq 2) and confirms that low concentration analytes
can be readily detected through SABRE even at low field.

and fit obtained in situ for 148 μmol of SABRE
hyperpolarized pyridine in 4.7 mL of CD3OD in the presence
of 2 mM catalyst at 5.4 mT with a SNR of 1.6 × 103 confirming that low concentration analytes can be observed in a
single acquisition.

In Situ Detection and Quantification at Low
Field in Pure and Diluted Ethanol
A strong signal was also
observed when this enhancement method was applied to 35 mg of pyridine
and 14 mg of catalyst dissolved in either 4 mL of ethanol or 9:1 H2O–ethanol mixture. In these cases, polarization levels
of 0.2 and 0.02%, respectively, were achieved in situ (Figure 5). These correspond to signal enhancement,
ηhyp, values of between 104 and 105. No difference was observed if the catalyst was activated
with H2 before or after the addition of water, nor when
the amount of ethanol was reduced to 0.4 mL, which, after dilution,
may be considered an important first step toward SABRE-hyperpolarized in vivo MRI.

and fit
of hyperpolarized Py in 4 mL of 9:1 water–ethanol mixture in situ at 6.3 mT. The irregular line shape may be attributed
to inhomogeneities associated with the injection of pH2.

As stated above, the
single resonance observed in Figures 4 and 5 reflects the sum of
the contributing SABRE hyperpolarization from all individual proton
sites. A fifth of the polarization may be attributed to each.

Chemical
Shift Resolution at High Field
To shed light
on the phase distribution, we have acquired high-field spectra. We
seek here to compare measurements at low and high field and consider
how changes from the transfer field, BS, (of order 10–3 T) to the measurements fields
affects the results.

When the analogous SABRE-polarized sample
consisting of 5.8 mg of catalyst, 11.8 mg of Py in 4.2 mL of methanol-d4 was transferred to high field, chemical-shift resolved
signals for the three distinct proton sites of pyridine were observed
that show phase variations according to the transfer field BS. These data are reproduced in Figure 6.

Figure 6 1H-NMR spectra of hyperpolarized pyridine in
methanol-d4 acquired on a 7 T MR imager,
polarized at
low field over a range of BS = 1–40 mT. The spectra were integrated with
the phase as shown and plotted as circles in Figure 7

The highest hyperpolarization
yield was detected when the mixing BS field
was between 4 and 7 mT. In this region,
all the detected high field signals are in phase. It is also possible
to sum the associated signal intensities to estimate what might be
observed in low field. The data obtained via this route are indicated
in Figure 7 by circles, which suggest that
the optimum polarization transfer field is the similar regardless
of where the measurement is made. Note, though, that the sample experienced
fields ranging from BS ≈ 10–3 T during SABRE, Btransfer ≈ 10–5 T during transfer, and Bdetection ≈ 101 T at detection.

Figure 7 Signal intensities
of hyperpolarized pyridine in methanol-d4 and ethanol as a function of the transfer
field, BS, over the range 0.5–22 mT. Signals were detected
at Earth
field (× and ∗) or at 7 T (○). The latter were
scaled to the same maximum value.

Solvent Effects Monitored by in Situ Detection
at Low Field
A more precise measure of the effects due to
field change was estimated by using the field-cycling system. In this
apparatus, the sample experiences less field variations as no transfer
is necessary, namely, an initial field of BS ≈ 10–3 T for SABRE and Bdetection ≈ 10–5 T for detection. BS was varied between 0 and 22.75 mT and the
resulting data is displayed in Figure 7, along
with the integrals of the high-field spectra as described in the previous
section, scaled to fit. The signal maxima for SABRE in methanol and
ethanol occur with very similar BS-field
values. When the rates of magnetization build-up are considered as
a function of the duration of the BS period
for each solvent, the signals in ethanol were found to appear with
twice the growth rate of those in perdeuterated methanol at 4 and
8 s, respectively. These time constants describing the polarization
build-up indicate that the maximum polarization is not achieved while
the transfer field BS is applied for 4
s. A total of 9 mg of catalyst were used.

Enhanced Polarization through
Isotopic Substitution
Because of the fact that pyridine has
three magnetically nonequivalent
protons, three separate enhanced resonances were identified in high-resolution
liquid-state 1H NMR spectra in CD3OD, located
at 8.5, 7.8, and 7.4 ppm, respectively. While this may represent an
advantage in some cases, as it allows for an in-depth investigation
of the influence of the mixing field on the enhancement at various
sites (see previous section), it raises significant difficulties when
pyridine is used in imaging experiments. Not only is the magnetization
transferred to several protons, leading to relatively low average
polarization levels in an image, but the fast relaxation rates and
the chemical shift artifacts which arise from the presence of nonequivalent
nuclei, further lower the results’ quality and contrast.

In order to circumvent this situation, pyridine-3,4,5-d3 was prepared. Pyridine-3,4,5-d3 presents the obvious advantage that the magnetization is
transferred to the only remaining two (equivalent) ortho-protons,
which furthermore have slower relaxation rates compared to the nondeuterated
molecule of 31 s in methanol-d4.

2D magnetic resonance imaging data of milligrams of hyperpolarized
pyridine and hyperpolarized pyridine-d3, respectively, in 0.6 mL of CD3OD and 2 mg of catalyst
were acquired in order to illustrate the strong effect isotopic substitution
can have on the signal.

A 169-fold apparent contrast enhancement
was calculated based on
a H2O internal standard for the image of the sample containing
pyridine (Figure 8, top). When analyzing the
images acquired on the sample prepared with deuterated substrate,
upon comparison with the reference sample, a contrast enhancement
ηhyp of 807 was obtained. This enhancement corresponded
to an apparent polarization level of 2.5% (Figure 8, bottom). The associated increase in polarization level is
due to the more efficient transfer of magnetization during SABRE to
fewer proton sites in 3,4,5-d3-pyridine
and the longer T1 value for the remaining
two protons.

and pyridine-3,4,5-d3 (bottom), each with
a reference sample, dissolved
in methanol and acquired at 9.4 T. A stronger signal was observed
from SABRE when the deuterated substrate was used.

High-Field 13C-Imaging of SABRE-Derived
Signals
Given the established utility of exploiting the long T1 of 13C by in vivo DNP and
PHIP, we have also investigated the hyperpolarization of a 13C in a carbonyl group using SABRE. This involved the initial preparation
of a sample of 13C-enriched nicotinamide. The resulting 13C-MRI of hyperpolarized nicotinamide that was detected in
a single acquisition where Phyp is 0.03%
is shown in Figure 9. Solution volumes were
0.6 mL methanol-d4 with 2 mg of catalyst
and 5 mg of substrate.

s to acquire. Bottom: Comparative image of the sample in thermal equilibrium
collected with 1100 averages that took 18 h 20 min used to establish
the level of 13C signal enhancement was 65-fold, corresponding

Discussion
In this paper we investigated the intricacies
of SABRE hyperpolarization
in a wide range of fields, at ≈10–3 T in situ, at ≈10–5 T in the Earth’
field, and at ≈101 T in the high fields of superconducting
magnets. Furthermore, we investigated biocompatible solvents and demonstrated
high-field 1H and 13C MR imaging of isotopically
enriched substances with respect to an in vivo application.

We have shown that a recently developed low-field MR system allows in situ signal detection and quantification by means of
using a thermally polarized reference. This has enabled us, for the
first time, to monitor and quantify the SABRE hyperpolarization yield
at BS, the point of polarization transfer.
It has been shown that in the case of pyridine a signal enhancement
value ηhyp of 320 × 103 results which
equates to ≈0.6% 1H polarization and is sufficient
for MRI detection. To generate an equal polarization in thermal equilibrium
at room temperature, a magnetic field of ≈3000 T would be required.

While this represents a signal enhancement of 6 orders of magnitude
compared to BS, it is still two orders
below unity. Higher pressure or other means to increase the pH2 concentration in solution may be used to
increase the hyperpolarization yield further. This is supported by
preliminary findings that the hyperpolarization yield increased ≈2.5-fold
by doubling the pH2 pressure from 5 to 10 bar. Given the
lower solubility of H2 in H2O, which is roughly
0.8 mM compared to 4 mM in methanol at 1 bar and room temperature,
we expect this to be very important in studies using water.

The in situ detection approach offers several
advantages over the conventional high-field detection methods which
necessarily involve sample transport and hence a delay where relaxation
can occur. There is also the possibility of further spin state evolution
during the transfer process which typically takes several seconds.
The data presented here suggest that such effects do not strongly
affect the optimal field for SABRE, BS, for the compound investigated. What is clear, however, is that
there is no need to fully commit an expensive instrument to developing
this phenomenon, as many important observations can be made at low
field without chemical shift resolution (e.g., new agents or catalysts).
Furthermore, interesting low-field application may emerge.

Many
of the molecules SABRE hyperpolarizes contain nonequivalent
nuclei. In order to observe the relative signal amplitudes that result
from the probing of these environments, separate resonances are required.
As Figure 6 reveals, these effects can be substantial.
Figure 7, however, shows that both in situ and high-field detection provide a similar view
of the effect BS plays on the overall
signal response of pyridine. The advantage of an in-phase signal was
pointed out before32,44 and is being investigated.

When pyridine is examined using NMR imaging, significant artifacts
may arise due to the multiple frequency responses. This problem is
not present at low field, where the signals overlap due to the smaller
frequency range over which the chemical shift is dispersed. However
the net signal amplitude which is detected must be reduced due to
internal cancellation as reflected in Figure 6. A strategy that overcomes internal cancellation is provided by
deuteration and the examination of pyridine-3,4,5-d3 or other single-resonance molecules. In this case, as
the SABRE effect transfers spin-polarization into just two protons
on pyridine, rather than the more usual five, and their relaxation
time is extended, superior signal gains and hence better images are
obtained in a very short amount of time.

A similar situation
where a single resonance is detected is illustrated
by using the biomolecule 13C-nicotinamide. This molecule
readily yields a 13C-MR image through SABRE, albeit the
polarization level is relatively low. Now as the T1 of 13C nuclei are longer than 1H and no thermal background is visible, ultrafast in vivo imagining can be facilitated using this approach.

The key
requirement for in vivo measurements of
SABRE, however, is a biocompatible solvent, which is illustrated here
in conjunction with ethanol and ethanol–water mixtures, where
further dilution is possible. This route may be necessary until water-soluble
catalysts are developed that deliver high polarization.

Conclusion
By means of a dedicated experimental setup and reference to a thermally
polarized sample, in situ detection and absolute
quantification of SABRE hyperpolarization was achieved in methanol,
ethanol, and aqueous ethanol. 1H and 13C NMR
imaging of hyperpolarized pyridine and 13C-nicotinamide
was demonstrated. Pure ethanol was found to be an efficient solvent
for the catalyst, offering the perspective for first in vivo experiments in conjunction with biomolecules such as nicotinamide. In situ detection while SABRE takes place offers an interesting
perspective of using renewing hyperpolarization.

These results
demonstrate that no extensive hardware is required
for highly sensitive NMR in aqueous solution. Because SABRE, unlike
other hyperpolarization methods, does not necessitate extensive equipment
and pH2 may be stored for days to weeks,
it may provide for mobile hyperpolarization on-demand. Its combination
with portable, low-field MR systems45 may
open up new, previous inaccessible applications, including mobile
diagnostic MRI or chemical analysis by NMR.
