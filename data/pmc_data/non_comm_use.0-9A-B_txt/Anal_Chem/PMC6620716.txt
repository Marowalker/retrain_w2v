The
cuticle, the outermost layer covering the epidermis of most
aerial organs of land plants, can have a heterogeneous composition
even on the surface of the same organ. The main cuticle component
is the polymer cutin which, depending on its chemical composition
and structure, can have different biophysical properties. In this
study, we introduce a new on-surface depolymerization method coupled
to liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) for a fast and spatially resolved chemical characterization
of the cuticle of plant tissues. The method is composed of an on-surface
saponification, followed by extraction with LESA using a chloroform–acetonitrile–water
(49:49:2) mixture and direct HRMS detection. The method is also compared
with LESA-HRMS without prior depolymerization for the analysis of
the surface of the petals of Hibiscus richardsonii flowers, which have a ridged cuticle in the proximal region and
a smooth cuticle in the distal region. We found that on-surface saponification
is effective enough to depolymerize the cutin into its monomeric constituents
thus allowing detection of compounds that were not otherwise accessible
without a depolymerization step. The effect of the depolymerization
procedure was more pronounced for the ridged/proximal cuticle, which
is thicker and richer in epicuticular waxes compared with the cuticle
in the smooth/distal region of the petal.

==== Body
The epidermal
layer of most
aerial organs of land plants is covered with a cuticle that acts as
a permeable barrier against water vapor loss and provides protection
against external stressors.1,2 The main component of
the cuticle is cutin, a lipid polymer which can have different biophysical
properties depending on its precise chemical composition and structure.3 As an example, arrays of regularly spaced nanoscale
ridges, or striations, were found in the cuticle on the flat epidermal
cells of Hibiscus trionum (also known as Venice mallow
or flower-of-an-hour) and many species of tulips. These cuticular
striations act as a diffraction grating and create an iridescent effect
where the color of the petal surface varies with the observation angle.4−7 Such optical properties have been shown to be salient to pollinators;6−8 however, the specific mechanisms by which plants can create striations
and diffraction gratings on their surface are not well understood.
As such mechanisms could be chemistry-driven, an in-depth chemical
characterization of both the striated and nonstriated portions of
the surface of the same petal would be key to identify the compounds
underpinning the chemical process. Previous studies showed a heterogeneous
composition of the cuticle even on the same organ.2,9−11 Thus, there is a need to perform a spatially resolved
characterization of the cuticle chemistry on the surface of the same
organ.

Direct surface analysis techniques like desorption electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) and liquid extraction surface
analysis mass spectrometry (LESA-MS) have proved useful to gain insights
into the composition of plant surfaces.12,13 DESI-MS can
provide a higher spatial resolution compared with LESA-MS (100–200
μm and ∼1 mm for DESI-MS and LESA-MS, respectively),
but LESA-MS allows the control of extraction time.12,13 Moreover, while a standard application of DESI-MS or LESA-MS is
suitable for a fast, spatially resolved analysis, it is mainly sensitive
to metabolites or free cutin monomers present on the surface, but
it is not able to provide information on the composition of the cutin
polymer or to detect metabolites deeply embedded in the cutin matrix.

In order to characterize the cutin polymer with mass spectrometry,
it is necessary to depolymerize it to break down the macromolecules
into their monomeric constituents. Typically, this is done by extracting
and depolymerizing bulk samples of cutin, thus losing any spatial
resolution on the same tissue and risking contaminations from compounds
coming from the bulk of the sample rather than the surface only.14−20 Another option is to mechanically strip off21 the cuticle before extraction and depolymerization. This procedure,
however, is not always possible. For example, on tissues such as petals,
that are fragile, it does not completely circumvent the problem of
contamination from tissues under the cuticle surface. Therefore, there
is a need for a fast and spatially resolved depolymerization approach
that selectively targets only the surface.

In this study, we
introduce a new method for the characterization
of the surface of plant tissues by a direct on-surface depolymerization
of the cuticle followed by LESA-MS analysis. Depolymerization was
done by adapting a method proposed by Mendez-Millan et al.22 for bulk samples which was modified here into
a fast and direct approach that provides spatially resolved characterization
on the surface of the same organ. This method was successfully applied
to the characterization of the cuticle of the petals of Hibiscus
richardsonii,23,24 a flower characterized by a ridged/proximal
and a smooth/distal portion (Figure 1). Cuticular ridges are characterized by a submicrometer
distance between a crest and its following trough (Figure 1), thus neither DESI-MS nor
LESA-MS provide sufficient spatial resolution to characterize the
intraridge chemical composition. However, the ridged/proximal and
smooth/distal portions both extend for centimeters on a petal surface
so both DESI-MS and LESA-MS would allow one to analyze separately
the chemical composition of each of the two portions of the petals.
LESA-MS additionally allows the control of extraction time and potentially
allows incorporation of a depolymerization step into an automatic
routine. Chemical composition of the different portions of the petals
are here compared and discussed to gain insights concerning the compounds
that may play a role in the formation of cuticular ridges on the surface
of the petals.

Materials
and Methods
Plant
Growth Conditions
Seeds of Hibiscus richardsonii (Voucher AK251841, Mayor Island (Tuhua), New Zealand) were obtained
from Dr. Brian G. Murray (University of Auckland). Plants were grown
to flowering in Levington M3 compost in a controlled greenhouse
environment at 26 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark regime.

Sample
Preparation and Analysis
Sample
Preparation
Sample preparation was done according to the
procedure already described in a previous study.13 Briefly, petals of Hibiscus richardsonii were detached from the flowers using tweezers, cleaned with a dry
white nylon brush and a gentle stream of N2, and placed
on a movable liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA, Triversa NanoMate
Advion, Ithaca, NY) sample stage covered with clean aluminum
foil.13 On some petals, LESA was done using
a non-polar (chloroform–acetonitrile–water (49:49:2))
solvent mixture or a polar (acetonitrile–water (90:10)) solvent
mixture without prior depolymerization, respectively.13 Formic acid (0.1%) was added to the water used for preparation
of the extraction mixtures in order to increase spray stability and
ionization efficiency.13 Other petals were
subjected to depolymerization before analysis.

Depolymerization
Depolymerization of the cutin was done via saponification directly
on the surface of the petals through a simplified procedure adapted
from the method used by Mendez-Millan et al.22 A droplet of about 20 μL volume of reagent mixture (6% KOH
in 10:90 water–methanol) was placed on the smooth/distal surface,
and another droplet was placed on the ridged/proximal surface of the
petals using a Pasteur pipet. The petals were left at room temperature
for 30 min for depolymerizing the cutin and drying of the solvent
on the petal surface before analysis. Immediately after depolymerization,
liquid extraction surface analysis was done as described in the section LESA-HRMS Analysis using the non-polar chloroform–acetonitrile–water
(49:49:2) mixture13 to minimize solubilization
of KOH, which could potentially cause corrosion of MS internal components.
Nevertheless, the non-polar mixture is also the most suitable mixture
for solubilization of cutin and wax monomers.

LESA-HRMS
Analysis
LESA-HRMS analysis was done on both depolymerized
and nondepolymerized samples according to the procedure already described
in a previous study.13 Briefly, 3 μL
of extraction mixture was deposited at a height of 1.4 mm from the
sample plate, and the liquid junction was maintained for 30 and 45
s for the non-polar and polar extraction mixtures, respectively; the
droplets containing the dissolved analytes were then aspirated at
a height of 1.2 mm from the sample plate and infused directly in a
chip-based nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) source (Triversa
NanoMate Advion, Ithaca, NY) operating in negative ionization mode.
The NanoMate temperature was set at 16 °C to reduce solvent evaporation,
especially when the non-polar mixture was used, and to allow for longer
extraction times to be used compared with previous studies.25,26 A direct contact of the tip with the sample surface, rather than
forming a liquid microjunction, could also allow for longer extraction
times27,28 but was not explored in our study. Blanks
were analyzed by repeating the same procedure (depolymerization and
extraction or extraction only) on the clean aluminum foil. Mass spectrometry
analysis of the LESA extracts was done with a LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a resolution
of 100 000 at m/z 400 and a typical
mass accuracy within ±2 ppm. Samples were sprayed at a gas (N2) pressure of 0.80 psi, ionization voltage of −1.4
kV (negative ionization mode), and with a transfer capillary temperature
of 210 °C. Data were acquired in full scan in the m/z ranges 80–600 and 150–1000 and
auto MS/MS analysis on the five most intense peaks with a collision-induced
dissociation (CID) energy of 35 (normalized collision energy). Concerning
data processing, molecular formulas were assigned using Xcalibur 2.1
(Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) within a ±5 ppm error and
under the following restrictions: number of 12C = 1–100, 13C = 0–1, H = 1–200, O = 0–50, N = 0–2, 32S = 0–1, and 34S = 0–1. Data were
then filtered using a Mathematica 10 (Wolfram Research Inc., U.K.)
code developed in-house and already described elsewhere,29 which uses a series of rules (e.g., nitrogen
rule, isotope ratios) and element ratios (O/C ≤ 2, H/C ≥
0.3, H/C ≤ 2.5, N/C ≤ 0.5, S/C ≤ 0.2) to determine
a list of chemically meaningful formula assignments. More details
about instrumental settings, calibrations, and data processing procedures
can be found elsewhere.13,29,30 The following discussion refers to CHO compounds only, which are
the most relevant cuticle building-blocks11 and represent almost entirely the compounds detected in this study.

Statistical
Analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) was done using
Statistica 10 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK) on 16 samples, representing
different spots analyzed (with direct depolymerization followed by
LESA-HRMS) on the ridged/proximal and smooth/distal portions of the
petals, and 587 active variables, describing the absolute intensities
of the predominant ions (most intense) in the mass spectra.

Results
and Discussion
The new cuticle characterization method developed
here was adapted
from Mendez-Millan et al.22 to translate
a bulk saponification procedure into a direct/on surface saponification
of the cutin prior to LESA-HRMS analysis. Saponification was chosen
over transesterification and CuO oxidation because it was the most
effective method for analysis of the cutin of maize22 and because it produces free fatty acid anions that can
be easily ionized with LESA-HRMS. The saponification method used by
Mendez-Millan et al.22 consisted of (i)
removal of free-lipids with dichloromethane extraction in an ultrasonic
bath, (ii) reflux for 18 h with a solution of 6% KOH in methanol–water
(90:10), (iii) filtration and washing of the residues with methanol,
(iv) acidification, (v) liquid–liquid extraction with dichloromethane,
and (vi) concentration in a rotary evaporator. Compared with the method
from Mendez-Millan et al.,22 the method
we proposed here is much faster (30 min vs 18 h), easier (single step
method), and spatially resolved. It also uses much less solvent (∼20
μL vs hundreds of milliliters used in several extraction steps
in addition to the reflux) and could potentially be incorporated into
an automatic routine with LESA-HRMS analysis. However, the method
used by Mendez-Millan et al.22 is exhaustive
and quantitative, in contrast to the qualitative but fast, spatially
resolved and direct method proposed here.

Another important
aspect concerns the possible contamination arising
from the tissues under the cuticle surface. Unlike the method we described
here, bulk extraction methods, as those used by Mendez-Millan et al.22 and others,14−20 are used on the whole sample, and not just the surface, and therefore
are intrinsically a mixture of the cuticle and other compartments
of the petal where unique signatures of the cuticle are more difficult
to isolate. Alternatively, the surface of the petal could be stripped
off mechanically and subjected to depolymerization.21 However, fragile tissues, like petals, can easily break
during such procedure therefore failing to prevent the problem of
contaminations coming from the underlying tissues.

The results
obtained with the new method developed here are compared
with LESA-HRMS analysis done using a procedure without saponification,
as used in previous studies.13,31 This comparison allows
the assessment of whether a direct depolymerization is efficient enough
to bring new insights into the composition of the cuticle of Hibiscus richardsonii petals in both the smooth/distal and
the ridged/proximal portions.

The HRMS analysis allows for an
unambiguous determination of molecular
formulas for the peaks detected in the mass spectra following the
method described above. Figure 2 shows the overlap and specificity of molecular formulas obtained
with the different methods used in this study. While some molecular
formulas were identified by all methods, the vast majority of compounds
were only detected by a single method. In particular, the newly proposed
method using depolymerization coupled to LESA-HRMS analysis provided
1020 new molecular formulas for the smooth/distal region and 1146
new molecular formulas for the ridged/proximal portion of the petals
that were not otherwise accessible without depolymerization.

Figure 2 Venn diagrams
showing the overlap and specificity of the different
methods in terms of number of assigned molecular formulas for the
smooth/distal (a) and ridged/proximal (b) portions of the petals.

The total number of peaks with
an assigned formula, the total ion
current (TIC), together with average O/C, H/C, double bond equivalents
(DBE), and carbon oxidation state (OSc) for the
smooth/distal and ridged/proximal portions are reported in Table 1 for all extraction
procedures tested. Numbers reported consider three different spots
on each portion (smooth/distal vs ridged/proximal) of the surface
of the petals, for at least three petals coming from at least two
different flowers. Table 1 shows that not only more peaks were detected with the depolymerization
method but also TIC was higher, for both the smooth/distal and ridged/proximal
portions of the petals by doing a depolymerization prior to LESA-HRMS
analysis. The effect of the depolymerization is more prominent for
the ridged/proximal portion where the number of detected peaks increased
roughly 2-fold compared with LESA-HRMS analysis without depolymerization
and the TIC increased by about 2 orders of magnitude. This is evident
also from Figure 3,
showing the mass spectra of the smooth/distal and ridged/proximal
portions of the petals obtained with LESA-HRMS with and without prior
depolymerization, respectively. In particular, the depolymerization
allowed us to extract many more compounds with high molecular weights
around 200–400 Da and 600–800 Da compared with LESA-HRMS
analysis without prior depolymerization.

The van Krevelen diagram
in Figure 4 shows the
H/C and O/C ratio distributions of the molecular
formulas detected using the three extraction methods. It can be seen
from Figure 4 that
the majority of peaks detected after depolymerization of the cutin
are distributed in the region of lipids (red square), the region corresponding
to low O/C and high H/C. This is also confirmed by the data reported
in Table 1, where it
is evident that, on average, molecular formulas in the depolymerization
extracts have a lower O/C, lower DBE (for the ridged part), and higher
H/C, which are typical of lipid compounds. It is also worth noticing
from Figure 4 that
not all compounds detected using LESA-HRMS without depolymerization
are also detected after depolymerization. This might be due to a degradation
of plant metabolites and/or suppression of the signal of those compounds
because of competitive ionization in the source of the mass spectrometer.

formulas detected on the smooth/distal and the ridged/proximal portions
(combined) of the petals of Hibiscus richardsonii using different extraction solvents, with or without prior depolymerization.
The red square (and zoomed region on the bottom part of the figure)
indicates the area of lipids, compounds that were more efficiently
extracted after depolymerization of the cutin.

The Kendrick mass defect plot in Figure 5 helps to identify homologous series of compounds
having the same number of rings/double bonds and heteroatoms but different
chain lengths. Main series detected through depolymerization coupled
to LESA-HRMS analysis are long-chain fatty acids, hydroxy fatty acids,
dihydroxy fatty acids, and monounsaturated hydroxy fatty acids (blue,
light-blue, and green series of horizontal data points in Figure 5), which are all
known components of plant epicuticular and intracuticular waxes.2,11,13 A list of the main compounds
detected using the new method is reported in Table 2, including tentative assignments based on
the molecular formulas or MS/MS spectra where available. The majority
of the compounds detected exclusively after depolymerization are long-chain
fatty acids and high-molecular weight compounds tentatively associated
with monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) lipids.

More specifically, the most intense peaks in the mass
spectra,
especially for the ridged/proximal portion, correspond to saturated
C16 and C18 fatty acids, monounsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids,
and diunsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids (Figure 6), which are well-known monomers of the cutin,
epicuticular, and intracuticular waxes.2,11,13 In addition to the monomeric cutin units and waxes,
some dimers can be seen in the high molecular weight region of the
mass spectra (Figure 6). A more exhaustive list of the main molecular formulas detected
that could be associated with cuticle constituents is reported in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Conversely,
the smooth/distal portion of the petal is richer, on average, in lower
molecular weight compounds (around m/z 150–200, see Figure 6), for example, those with molecular formulas C7H6O2, C9H10O3, C7H6O5, and C10H16O3, which may be associated with plant metabolites.

Next, we performed a principal
component analysis (PCA) on the
587 most intense peaks in the mass spectra obtained by analyzing the
ridged/proximal and smooth/distal portions of the petals using the
new method with prior depolymerization. This analysis confirms a markedly
different composition of the cuticle in the two portions of the petals
(Figure 7). In fact,
the samples taken from the ridged/proximal portions are scattered
on the top part of the score plot (Figure 7a), while the samples taken from the smooth/distal
portions of the petals are clustered toward the bottom-right part
of the score plot (Figure 7a). As shown by the loading plot in Figure 7b, the differences between the ridged/proximal
and the smooth/distal portions can be ascribed mainly to a few compounds
with molecular formulas C10H10O3,
C16H30O2, C18H30O2, C18H32O2, C7H6O2, C9H10O3, C10H16O3, and C46H78O4. The ridged/proximal portion is richer in C10H10O3 (methoxycinnamic acid), C16H30O2 (palmitoleic acid), C18H30O2 (linolenic acid), and C18H32O2 (linoleic acid) while the smooth/distal portion
is richer in C7H6O2 (salicylaldehyde),
C9H10O3 (dihydro-coumaric acid),
C10H16O3 (pinonic acid), and C46H78O4 (hexadecanoyloleanolic acid).
Whether these compounds (tentatively assigned based on the molecular
formulas and MS/MS spectra where available) may play a role in the
formation of ridges on the surface of the proximal portion of the
petals of Hibiscus richardsonii will need to be investigated
in future studies.

Figure 7 Scores (a) and loadings (b) of the first two principal
components,
explaining 94.4% of the variance of the data set, obtained from the
principal components analysis applied to the 587 most intense peaks
in the mass spectra of the ridged/proximal and smooth/distal portions
of the petals analyzed with the new method proposed here, i.e., direct
depolymerization followed by LESA-HRMS using the nonpolar solvent
mixture. The loading plot only shows the compounds that contributed
the most to differentiate the ridged/proximal from the smooth/distal
portion of the petal.

These results show that the direct depolymerization method
presented
here is able to provide a qualitative composition of the surface of
the petals with the possibility of capturing important differences
in the chemical composition of different regions of the petal cuticle
(smooth/distal vs ridged/proximal).

Conclusions
We
presented a new analytical method using direct/on surface depolymerization
coupled with LESA-HRMS for the detailed characterization of the surface
of plant tissues. This method was used for the chemical characterization
of the cuticle of Hibiscus richardsonii petals, whose
surface is characterized by a ridged/proximal region and a smooth/distal
portion.

The on-surface saponification proved to be effective
to depolymerize
the cutin to obtain qualitative analysis of cuticular constituents.
Comparison with direct analysis without prior depolymerization showed
that (i) depolymerization was effective to break down the cutin polymers
into their monomeric constituents, (ii) the signal of other compounds
was suppressed, probably due to competitive ionization and degradation.
For these reasons, it would be beneficial to analyze the petal cuticle
via LESA-HRMS analysis both with and without prior depolymerization
in order to obtain a more complete picture of the surface composition.
The depolymerization step proposed here is compatible with the Triversa
NanoMate and could potentially be incorporated into an automated procedure,
which is currently not possible due to software limitations.

The fast and spatially resolved depolymerization approach presented
here, that selectively targets only the surface, allowed detection
of a set of cuticular compounds that were not otherwise accessible
without a depolymerization step. The effect of the depolymerization
was more pronounced for the ridged/proximal portion of the petal,
which has a thicker cuticle and is richer in epicuticular waxes compared
with the smooth/distal portion. Our results are consistent with previous
studies that showed that the composition of the plant cuticle can
be chemically and morphologically heterogeneous even between different
regions of the same petal.13,31 Further experiments
are necessary to establish whether there is a link between chemical
composition of the cuticle and patterning differences of plant surfaces.
