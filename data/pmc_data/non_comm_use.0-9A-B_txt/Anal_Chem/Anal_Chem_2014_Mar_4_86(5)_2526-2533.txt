Directed
evolution relies on iterative cycles of randomization
and selection. The outcome of an artificial evolution experiment is
crucially dependent on (i) the numbers of variants that can be screened
and (ii) the quality of the assessment of each clone that forms the
basis for selection. Compartmentalization of screening assays in water-in-oil
emulsion droplets provides an opportunity to screen vast numbers of
individual assays with good signal quality. Microfluidic systems have
been developed to make and sort droplets, but the operator skill required
precludes their ready implementation in nonspecialist settings. We
now establish a protocol for the creation of monodisperse double-emulsion
droplets in two steps in microfluidic devices with different surface
characteristics (first hydrophobic, then hydrophilic). The resulting
double-emulsion droplets are suitable for quantitative analysis and
sorting in a commercial flow cytometer. The power of this approach
is demonstrated in a series of enrichment experiments, culminating
in the successful recovery of catalytically active clones from a sea
of 1 000 000-fold as many low-activity variants. The
modular workflow allows integration of additional steps: the encapsulated
lysate assay reactions can be stopped by heat inactivation (enabling
ready control of selection stringency), the droplet size can be contracted
(to concentrate its contents), and storage (at −80 °C)
is possible for discontinuous workflows. The control that can be thus
exerted on screening conditions will facilitate exploitation of the
potential of protein libraries compartmentalized in droplets in a
straightforward protocol that can be readily implemented and used
by protein engineers.

Directed
evolution is arguably
the dominant approach to alter and improve the activity and stability
of protein biocatalysts.1−3 Experimentally, directed evolution
relies upon iterative rounds of creation of novel protein variants
by introduction of random mutations into the target gene and selection
of individuals with desirable characteristics. The size of the gene
libraries that can be obtained from these experiments easily exceeds
the throughput of any screening system, implying that screening is
the bottleneck in the exploration of sequence space. The ability to
ease this bottleneck depends largely on the resources that are available—in
typical academic research laboratories where screening is carried
out on agar or microtiter plates, library sizes are limited to around
104 variants, whereas advanced robotic facilities can increase
the throughput to the 106 range, although this increase
in throughput comes at significant cost.4 As mutations that improve the function of a biocatalyst are rare
(i.e., most mutations either do not change the activity or are deleterious),
many mutants have to be screened to at least have a chance of finding
desired “hits”. To improve the efficiency of screening
efforts, the development of user-friendly, low-cost, and high-throughput
screening techniques capable of screening larger libraries and selecting
rare variants with improved activity are crucial.

Screening
of an enzyme activity in individual intact cells, typically
using cell survival for essential reactions, or flow cytometry (FACS;
fluorescence-activated cell-sorting) if a fluorescent readout of activity
is available, is a particularly efficient approach to library screening,
but it also has particular restrictions. Specifically, the reaction
substrate must be able to diffuse into the cells, and in the case
of FACS the reaction product must be unable to leave the cell by diffusion
or alternatively the product should be displayable on the cell surface
to provide a fluorescent readout.5 As these
conditions are not met for most reactions, alternative approaches
are needed. One emerging technology that shows promise for screening
libraries with remarkable efficiency is miniaturization of the directed
evolution assay into artificial reaction compartments with cell-like
dimensions. Use of water-in-oil microdroplets typically reduces assay
volumes to the picoliter or femtoliter range, representing a reduction
in sample volume of up to 100 000-fold (compared to robotic
screening systems with volumes >0.1 μL per sample).6−12 The droplet boundary traps reaction products of multiple enzymatic
turnovers within the compartment to provide a readout of reaction
progress and also allows maintenance of the genotype–phenotype
linkage.8 Maintenance of this linkage is
necessary during selections to relate the functional trait of a protein
(such as catalytic activity) to the nucleic acid sequence encoding
it. Thus, the linkage gives access to the identity of a library member
after selection.

The simplest approach to production of water-in-oil
droplets makes
use of bulk emulsion methods in which an aqueous phase and surfactant-bearing
oil phase are vigorously mixed to produce an emulsion.13−15 This is a simple and rapid method of droplet formation, but it has
the significant disadvantage of producing droplets that are highly
polydisperse in size. The cubic dependence of volume on diameter—for
example, a doubling of droplet diameter leads to an 8-fold increase
in volume—leads to massive variations in enzyme concentration
between droplets and potential for substrate limitation in smaller
droplets.16 These factors preclude the
use of polydisperse droplets for quantitative or comparative applications.

Microfluidic devices have been used to generate monodisperse water-in-oil
emulsion droplets of picolitre volumes17,18 that can be
filled with single species (i.e., cells4,19,20 or genes).6,21−24 Such droplets are typically made at a rate of 1–10 kHz, although
recently it was shown that very small monodisperse droplets (diameter
∼4 μm) can be produced at frequencies of up to 1.3 MHz.25 Monodisperse emulsions have found broad utility
in analytical applications such as digital PCR,7 single cell analysis,26 sizing
of organelles or nanoparticles,27 or compound
screening28 to name but a few.10,29

While straightforward interrogation of water-in-oil droplets
by
fluorescence microscopy or on microfluidic chips equipped with fluorescence
detection allows their use in analytical applications, directed evolution
experiments depend on the ability to sort positive droplets from the
more numerous negative population. Microfluidic chips and rigs capable
of measuring fluorescence and sorting of monodisperse water-in-oil
droplets have been developed30,31 that perform at frequencies
between 0.3 and 2 kHz, as demonstrated for yeast displaying a peroxidase,4 in vitro expressed proteins,22 or cell lysates (to screen for hydrolases).20 As impressive an advance as these droplet sorters
are, they are technically challenging to set up, requiring knowledge
of not just microfluidics, but also optics, electronics, and software
coding to assemble and control the detection and electrosorting instrumentation
that connects to the chip. Due to the complexity of these systems,
they are unfortunately suited only to specialist laboratories; common
use by a wider community would be facilitated if standard equipment
rather than custom-made devices4,20 could be used.

One standard technique that could be used for sorting in place
of a microfluidic droplet sorter is FACS. Modern FACS instruments
are a mature technology that are user-friendly, high-throughput, widely
available, and have low running costs. Furthermore, they have the
advantage of being multiparametric and routinely have the ability
to detect several different fluorophores in parallel.32 Unfortunately, FACS instruments are incompatible with nonaqueous
suspensions, so to sort a water-in-oil emulsion, it is necessary to
carry out a further emulsification to produce a water-in-oil-in-water
double emulsion. The resulting sample, now dispersed in an aqueous
phase, is amenable to FACS sorting.

Double emulsions have in
fact been prepared and sorted by FACS
previously; however, such attempts involved highly polydisperse bulk
emulsions generated by vortexing with a tissue homogenizer or extruder.33−40 Indeed, the polydispersity is exacerbated by the combined effect
of the two emulsification steps necessary to generate the double emulsion.34,37,41 Polydisperse emulsions give rise
to a situation in which droplets carrying genes encoding proteins
with the same activity can exhibit dramatically different assay outcomes
depending on their size, although selections in polydisperse droplets
may still be successful if the activity difference between positive
hits and the rest of the library is very large. Some researchers have
addressed the polydispersity problem by introducing external markers,42 such as coexpression of GFP,41 but the inclusion of markers complicates the biological
setup and does not fully remedy the problem of varying catalyst concentration
and the volume dependence of fluorescence intensity.

As an alternative
to microfluidic droplet sorting, we introduce
a straightforward method to convert a directed evolution assay previously
conducted in water-in-oil emulsion droplets20 into double emulsions in two separate microfluidic devices at a
rate of about 107 droplets per hour. The screening procedure
consists of the encapsulation of single cells, their lysis, and enzymatic
assay of the cell lysate and sorting of double emulsion droplets in
a subsequent step with a standard cytometric sorter (Figure 1). The throughput and suitability of this method
for directed evolution is demonstrated by enrichment experiments that
recover hits from a sea of 106-fold as many alternative
droplets.

Figure 1 Generating double emulsions on two chips and selection of active
biocatalysts. The workflow for one cycle of directed evolution consists
of the following steps: (i) Gene libraries are generated from an enzyme-encoding
plasmid. (ii) E. coli cells produce
the biocatalyst of interest in liquid culture. (iii) In a first microfluidic
device (with hydrophobic, fluorocarbon-coated channel walls), single
cells are compartmentalized in droplets together with substrate and
lysis agents. (iv) After cell lysis, substrate and cytoplasmically
expressed enzyme react to yield a fluorescent product. (v) The reaction
is allowed to proceed for a desired incubation period (in our case
up to 24 h, but droplets are stable for at least one month). The reaction
progress can be stopped simultaneously in all water-in-oil droplets
by heat inactivation, so that the time required for double emulsion
formation and sorting does not extend the assay period. (vi) Next,
primary droplets are transformed into double emulsions in a second
device with identical design to the one used in (iii) but with hydrophilic
coating. (vii) Variants exhibiting the highest activity are identified
and sorted in a standard flow cytometer. The recovered DNA can be
used for further rounds of evolution without PCR amplification when
a high-copy plasmid is used. The procedure takes little time: droplet
formation (steps iii and vi) takes place at a frequency of 6–12
kHz, so that a library of 107 double emulsion droplets
is produced in 90 min. Sorting 107 droplets at a rate of
10–15 kHz takes about 15 min.

Results and Discussion
Formation of Monodisperse Double Emulsion
Droplets
Primary emulsion droplets were formed in a fluorocarbon-coated
chip
(Figure 2A) in which a surfactant-containing
fluorous oil carrier phase meets an aqueous stream at a flow-focusing
junction (Figure 2B; see Supporting Information for notes on the choice of oil phase).
The aqueous stream is itself produced by mixing the flow from two
separate channels (one carrying cell suspension, and the other containing
lysis agents and enzyme substrate) immediately prior to droplet formation.
This sequence leaves sufficient time for cell encapsulation in droplets
prior to lysis, so that the genotype–phenotype linkage is maintained,
and also controls the initiation of the enzyme assay.20 After formation, the stable droplets (Figure 2C) are stored temporarily in a syringe (Figure 2D) before injection into a second chip (Figure 2E) along with a surfactant-containing aqueous carrier phase
to form a double emulsion. This second chip has a hydrophilic surface
to promote wetting of the channel walls with the aqueous carrier phase
and prevent droplet adherence to the walls.43 Immediately prior to double emulsion formation, the water-in-oil
droplets are spaced out with fluorinated oil to prevent double occupation
in double emulsion droplets (Figure 2F). These
double emulsion droplets are monodisperse based on inspection of images
of 150 droplets that show only a 2.5% standard deviation of the measured
diameter. Double emulsion droplets thus obtained (Figure 2G) are stable for at least 1 year when stored submerged
in aqueous buffer at room temperature, without any coalescence observed
by microscopy. Further manipulation of the double emulsion droplets
is possible: they maintain their structural integrity despite heating,
freezing, or shrinking or expanding by osmosis, and they are amenable
to sorting in a standard FACS instrument (described below).

double emulsion droplets using a two-chip system.

(inlet 2), and cell suspension (inlet 3) are injected into a microfluidic
flow-focusing device from syringes. (B) The aqueous samples (originating
from inlets 2 and 3) are first mixed, then primary droplets are formed
in the flow-focusing junction; the arrow indicates the direction of
flow. (C) Image of the monodisperse water-in-oil droplets formed in
this procedure. (D) The emulsion droplets are taken up in a syringe,
overlaid with mineral oil, and cushioned with a bottom layer of fluorinated
oil. The top mineral oil layer serves to reduce the dead volume of
the tubing connecting the syringe and the microfluidic chip. (E) A
device with identical design to the first emulsification device, but
different surface coating is used for formation of double emulsions. Aqueous carrier phase, spacing oil, and water-in-oil
emulsion are injected (inlets 1, 2, and 3, respectively) into a second,
hydrophilic chip. (F) Image showing the production of water–oil–water
double emulsion. (G) The double emulsion droplets produced in the
previous steps are monodisperse. Movies showing single and double
emulsion formation are available in the SI.

In contrast to previous double
emulsion generation methods carried
out in a single step on one microfluidic chip,18,43−45 the system described here uses two separate chips.
Disassembly of the two emulsification steps considerably simplifies
the process of double emulsion production. Double emulsion formation
on a single chip requires careful adjustment of the flow rates for
the sample components and both carrier phases to prevent single droplets
being split or double emulsions with multiple inner droplets being
produced. Use of two separate chips replaces the need for flow rate
balancing with two straightforward emulsion procedures and also allows
greater control over droplet size by enabling the use of chips with
different channel widths to control the thickness of the oil layer
of the double emulsion. Importantly, the fabrication of the chips
used in this two-step method is more straightforward than production
of chips able to produce double emulsion directly on a single chip.
To prepare a single chip for double emulsion formation, different
sections of the chip must be differently coated (either fluorophilically
or hydrophilically) to ensure wetting with the appropriate carrier
phase.43 During the application of these
surface coatings, the complementary channels have to be blocked with
air to maintain their surface properties. The two-chip system described
here breaks down these single chip features into separate modules,46 facilitating its operation by researchers with
less experience in microfluidics. The device manufacturing remains
simple, in contrast to a much more complicated dual-layer device that
has recently been used to create double emulsions by coaxial flow-focusing.47

Highly Efficient Identification of “Hits”
Measured
by Enrichment Analysis
The ability to isolate droplets containing
an active enzyme that produces a fluorescent product was tested by
measuring the enrichment of hits from an overwhelming majority of
droplets containing an inactive variant. The model enzyme used for
this experiment was a member of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily,
the promiscuous arylsulfatase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAS),48−50 that has previously been evolved on-chip to improve
its promiscuous phosphonate hydrolase activity.20 PAS is a well-characterized sulfatase,51 which exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the substrate
fluorescein disulfate and releases fluorescein to give a fluorescent
readout of reaction progress. To mimic a library sorting experiment,
expression of both the active wild-type enzyme and the low activity
H211A variant (∼105-fold reduced kcat/KM; see Table S-1 for details) was performed in separate liquid cultures
and cells were mixed prior to compartmentalization into droplets to
produce a range of active to inactive ratios (Table 1). To minimize doubly occupied droplets, the number of compartmentalized
cells was 10-fold lower than the number of droplets produced. According
to a Poisson distribution,52 this ensured
that ∼95% of occupied droplets contained a single cell. Ten
minutes after compartmentalization, droplets enclosing the active
PAS variant were highly fluorescent (indicating product formation),
whereas empty droplets and droplets containing H211A showed a low
level of background fluorescence arising from cell lysis prior to
emulsion formation (Figure 3A). In the subsequent
FACS sorting step, the highly fluorescent population was collected
to obtain active variants (Figure 3B).

average droplet occupancy for each sample. Note that droplet shrinking
(see section below on osmotic droplet volume changes) was employed
to maintain the throughput at the higher occupancy used in the third
experiment. Enrichment was determined by dividing the percentage of
positives after sorting by that before sorting.

arylsulfatase (PAS) or its inactive mutant AZ0 (see Table S-1), shown here with a sample in which 1 in 1000 compartmentalized
cells expresses the active wild-type enzyme. (A) Overlay of fluorescent
and visual microscope images showing one droplet exhibiting enzymatic
activity (the full-scale images are shown in Figure
S-5). The surrounding droplets lack enzymatic activity, because
they are either unoccupied (∼90% of the droplets) or contain
the low activity enzyme variant (∼10%). (B) In a plot of fluorescence
versus forward scatter (derived from gated FSC/SSC data, Figure S-8) two droplet populations are clearly
distinguishable. The highly fluorescent population represents droplets
with enzymatic activity. The fluorescent droplet displayed in A corresponds
to the highly fluorescent population displayed in B.

The plasmid DNA recovered from the sorted double
emulsions was
transformed into E. coli cells, which
were grown on agar plates overnight. The number of colonies obtained
per sorted droplet reflected the efficiency of DNA recovery.20 Typically one to five transformants were obtained
per sorted droplet (using the high copy plasmid pASK-IBA63b-plus with
∼1000 plasmids per cell), thus ensuring that DNA from the majority
of the sorted droplets was recovered. Our results confirm the previously
described finding that the transformation of one cell requires on
average 400 plasmid molecules with our experimental setup.20 To determine enrichment as a quantitative measure
of successful sorting, the clones obtained after sorting were rescreened
on agar plates for sulfatase activity using an indolyl sulfate substrate,
which forms a blue precipitate product in active colonies (Figure S-3). The enrichment was calculated as
the percentage of positive colonies after sorting divided by the percentage
of active cells before sorting. For example, the sample with an initial
content of 0.1% active cells showed 80% active, blue variants after
sorting, giving an enrichment of 800-fold (= 80/0.1) (see Table 1), whereas a sample with 0.01% active cells in the
starting population was enriched 2500-fold.

Our enrichment compares
favorably with previously published work
in which sorting of model libraries in polydisperse double emulsions
gave enrichment values of 40- to 290-fold.37,41 Although the details of the experimental protocol differ between
the different reports, it is clear that the approach we present here
surpasses previous efforts, with our sorted samples approaching purity.
This success prompted us to test our system with a challenging sample
containing just one positive hit per million cells.

Osmotic Droplet
Volume Changes Enable Production of High Occupancy
Droplets for Sorting of Extremely Rare Events
For enrichment
of very rare events (less frequent than 1 in 100 000) in large
libraries (>107 members), droplet occupancy must be
increased
to avoid the need to sort an overwhelming number of droplets. Increasing
the cell occupancy is, however, challenging due to cell deposition
at channel walls (and subsequent channel blockage) and because high
density cell suspensions decrease the stability of single emulsion
water-in-oil droplets such that widespread coalescence is observed
within 1 h. These problems can be counteracted to some degree by producing
larger droplets, which decreases the required density of the cell
suspension and makes use of wider microfluidic channels that are less
likely to get blocked during droplet formation. However, to ensure
stable droplet break-off during FACS sorting, the particle size should
not exceed one-third of the nozzle diameter. This means that a common
flow cytometer setup with a 70 μm nozzle can only sort droplets
with a diameter of less than 23 μm. We address this practical
problem with a method that makes use of osmosis to shrink large droplets
to a size suitable for FACS sorting (Figure S-6). For example, exposing double emulsion droplets to an external
solution with an ionic strength 10-fold higher than that of the buffer
inside the droplets resulted in a 10-fold decrease of the volume of
the inner aqueous droplet (Figure S-6, Table S-2). This represents a 2.2-fold decrease in inner droplet diameter,
with the diameter of the whole double emulsion droplet being decreased
by 23%. The overall double emulsion shrinkage is less dramatic than
that of the inner droplet as the volume of encapsulating oil remains
constant, and so it forms a thicker layer as the droplet shrinks.
Thus, while the size change of the inner droplet is directly dependent
on the molarity of the outer solution, the overall size change depends
on the thickness of the oil layer surrounding the inner droplet, with
a thinner oil layer enabling a greater degree of shrinkage.

Applying this approach to decrease droplet size, enrichment of very
rare variants was attempted. A sample that initially contained only
1 hit in 1 000 000 cells (0.0001% cells expressing active
protein) was successfully enriched to yield 10% active variants after
only one sorting round of droplets with an average occupancy of one
cell per droplet, corresponding to an enrichment of 100 000-fold.

Control of Assay Duration
The ability to control the
duration of an enzymatic assay is key to controlling the stringency
and hence selection pressure of the assay, and it is an important
issue to consider in any directed evolution experiment. To demonstrate
that reaction times can be controlled at will in our screening system,
we performed a discontinuous assay by compartmentalizing PAS enzyme
solution (crude lysate of cells expressing wild-type PAS) along with
substrate in droplets and heat inactivating the enzyme after chosen
assay times. The assay development in these droplets was compared
to a progress curve obtained using the same lysate in a plate reader.
The use of cell lysate simplified the analysis by excluding the Poisson
distribution that would complicate cell-based experiments. Lysate
sample droplets were mixed with reference droplets (negative) containing
substrate only. Inclusion of “negative” droplets provided
a reference for each reading and also allowed monitoring of leakage
of product from the assay droplets.54,55 The mixture
of lysate-containing and reference droplets was heat-inactivated at
the indicated time points, and after all samples were collected, they
were independently transformed into double emulsions and analyzed
by flow cytometry (Figure 4A).

Figure 4 Introduction of time control by stopping the reaction at different
time points. Diluted PAS-containing cell lysate was mixed with substrate
on a microfluidic chip (Figure 2B) upon droplet
formation. (A) FACS analysis of droplets with inactivated cell lysate.
Heat inactivation was performed immediately after collection (t = 0, red), after 15 min (orange), 30 min (yellow), 1 h
(green), 2 h (blue), 4 h (light violet), and 24 h (dark violet; end
point measurement). The fluorescence distribution diagrams of heat-inactivated
enzymatic reaction in droplets (left), measured 30 h after the reaction
was started, show the background control droplets (with substrate
only) in pale and droplets containing cell lysate in dark colors.
(B) Overlay of normalized relative fluorescence versus time data obtained
from FACS analysis (colored points corresponding to peaks in (A) and
kinetics measurement in 96-well format (gray curve).

The FACS histogram verifies that clearly distinguishable
positive
and negative populations were still present after heat inactivation.
In this lysate assay, the average coefficient of variation (standard
deviation/mean fluorescence) of the positive peaks was 0.13, highlighting
the monodispersity of the double emulsion generated using the two-chip
method described here. A small amount of leakage from positive to
reference droplets containing substrate alone (Figure 4A, pale curves) during heat inactivation at 95 °C for
5 min is reflected in the slightly increased fluorescence of negative
peaks at the later time points. This leakage resulted in a 2-fold
shift of the reference droplets over the course of the assay, whereas
the positive droplets show more than a 10-fold increase in fluorescence.

In parallel with the droplet-based assay, a progress curve for
the reaction carried out under the same conditions, but without encapsulation,
was recorded in a microplate. The overlay of the normalized progress
curve with normalized mean fluorescence values from FACS analysis
shows identical reaction progress in 96-well plates and droplets (Figure 4B).

Until now, all screening
efforts carried out
on chip or in polydisperse emulsions have depended on the screening
being carried out before the end point of the assay
to allow valid comparison of samples, leading to considerable constraints
in terms of user-friendliness of the system. The ability to introduce
time control for stringent screening in a directed evolution experiment
is an outstanding feature of the two-chip system. Its technical implementation
by heat inactivation permits reactions to be stopped at any desired
time point, permitting variation of assay duration, and hence stringency
of the subsequent selection, to be altered at will. Furthermore, the
ability to stop the assay allows the subsequent sample screening to
be carried out when convenient for the experimenter, greatly improving
the usability of this screening system.

Stopping Reactions in Discontinuous
Workflow
The high
stability of double emulsion droplets is the basis for their storage
in frozen form at low temperatures so that they can be later analyzed
or used in subsequent steps of more complex workflows. After being
shock frozen in 20% glycerol, double emulsion droplets can be stored
at −20 °C or −80 °C for at least 1 month without
change. During freezing, the glycerol in the outer aqueous solution
causes shrinking of double emulsions through osmosis. However, after
sample thawing and rehydration by buffer exchange to a buffer isotonic
with the buffer inside the droplets, the original size of the double
emulsion is readily restored (Figure 5A). Flow
cytometric analysis of a thawed and rehydrated sample (a mixture of
high and low fluorescence droplets) showed that there was no significant
change in fluorescence compared to an aliquot that was not frozen
(Figure 5B). Although a small decrease in fluorescence
of both high and low fluorescence droplets in the frozen sample is
seen, the relative position of the populations does not change significantly,
nor does the ratio of their mean fluorescence values. Thus, these
data (Figure 5B) do not indicate significant
small molecule transfer during the freezing–thawing procedure
and demonstrate that sample identity is maintained after storage in
a frozen state.

Figure 5 Double emulsion droplets can be stored long-term after
freezing
(A) Shock freezing of droplets in 20% glycerol solution leads to shrinking
of the inner aqueous droplet due to osmosis; however, rehydration
in a solution of low molarity (150 mM) is readily achieved. Full-scale
source images are shown in Figure S-7.
(B) FACS analysis confirms that the relative fluorescence difference
of droplets before (black) and after freezing (gray) does not change
significantly. Peak centers are 4.5, 12.1, 1480, and 1750 RFU, giving
positive/negative fluorescence ratios of 145 before freezing and 330
after.

This procedure contributes to
the convenience of double emulsions
for screening and also enables standardization of FACS measurements
obtained at different times. The ability to store samples allows production
of multiple samples over several days to weeks followed by their simultaneous
analysis, saving time and enabling workflows that suit the experimenter.
The creation of standard samples that can be used for adjustment of
FACS parameters, such as the gain on each detection channel, facilitates
the comparison of data collected during different FACS sessions.

Conclusions
We have presented here a simple, versatile,
and user-friendly procedure
for sorting of monodisperse double emulsion droplets in which the
activity of an intracellularly expressed enzyme is assayed in cell
lysate. The use of two chips for double emulsion generation (at 6–12
kHz) simplifies the monodisperse emulsion generation procedure, and
offers flexibility in controlling droplet sizes and oil shell thickness
as well as enabling manipulation of the sample, for example by thermal
inactivation to stop the enzyme assay at chosen time point(s). A library
of 107 double emulsion droplets is produced in 90 min.
The sorting step (at a rate of 10–15 kHz) takes advantage of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), a well-established method
enabling a throughput of >108 droplets per day.5 FACS sorters are widespread and readily used
due to their ability to record numerous parameters simultaneously,
such as relative volume, internal granularity, and fluorescence in
multiple channels.

The method we describe here is broadly applicable,
although the
usual limits of droplet-based approaches still apply: enzymes that
are to be evolved must yield a fluorescent readout (either directly
as the product or via a coupled reaction) to be amenable to FACS.
There are, however, a variety of fluorogenic probes that are readily
available commercially. Furthermore, substrate and, particularly,
the product, must not leak from the droplets within the assay time
frame (i.e., for a period required to produce detectable fluorophore
readout).

We also present a method for long-term storage of
frozen double
emulsions that can be reliably and reproducibly thawed and analyzed
when convenient. Finally, the semipermeable nature of the oil shell
used here allows double emulsions to be shrunk (or expanded) to a
size convenient for sorting. This feature was exploited to allow the
single-step enrichment by 100 000-fold of a sample containing
just one positive cell per 1 000 000 negative cells.
This is the greatest enrichment measured to date
in a model selection and indicates that very rare events can be reliably
retrieved using our experimental setup.

Hitherto, single water-in-oil
emulsion droplets handled on-chip
had been the only well-established format that combined high-precision
assays in monodisperse compartments with ultrahigh throughput (>107) multistep processes.20 The ready
access to monodisperse double emulsions, the degrees of freedom in
manipulating droplet contents offline, and the extraordinary enrichment
ratios achieved collectively suggest that our format for sorting of
double emulsions can usefully complement the toolkit of in vitro compartmentalization.
Further improvements to throughput will come through increasing the
rate-limiting step of droplet production, possibly by either multiplexing55 or developing new and improved oils and/or surfactant
combinations that allow higher flow rates. However, the current throughput
already exceeds that of currently used screening systems (e.g., based
on robotic liquid handling) at a fraction of their cost. For those
embarking on compartmentalized experiments for the first time, the
procedures outlined here may be the simplest entry point to harness
the power of droplet microfluidics.
