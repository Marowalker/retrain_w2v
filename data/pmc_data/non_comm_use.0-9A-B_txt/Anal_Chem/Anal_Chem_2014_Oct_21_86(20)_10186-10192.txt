The
kinetic adsorption profile at the DNA–gold nanoparticle
(AuNP) interface is probed by following the binding and organization
of thiolated linear DNA and aptamers of varying chain lengths (15,
30, 44, and 51 mer) to the surface of AuNPs (13.0 ± 1.0 nm diameter).
A systematic investigation utilizing dynamic light scattering has
been performed to directly measure the changes in particle size during
the course of a typical aging-salting thiolated DNA/AuNP preparation
procedure. We discuss the effect of DNA chain length, composition,
salt concentration, and secondary structure on the kinetics and conformation
at the DNA–AuNP interface. The adsorption kinetics are chain-length
dependent, composition independent, and not diffusion rate limited
for the conditions we report here. The kinetic data support a mechanism
of stepwise adsorption of thiols to the surface of AuNPs and reorganization
of the thiols at the interface. Very interestingly, the kinetic increases
of the particle sizes are modeled accurately by the pseudo-second-order
rate model, suggesting that DNA could possess the statistically well-defined
conformational evolution. Together with other experimental evidence,
we propose a dynamic inner-layer and outer-tail (DILOT) model to describe
the evolution of the DNA conformation after the initial adsorption
of a single oligonucleotide layer. According to this model, the length
of the tails that extend from the surface of AuNPs, capable for hybridization
or molecular recognition, can be conveniently calculated. Considering
the wide applications of DNA/AuNPs, the results should have important
implications in sensing and DNA-directed nanoparticle assembly.

DNA-functionalized
gold nanoparticles
(DNA/AuNPs) are attractive systems with applications ranging from
the construction of self-assembled materials to biosensors.1−7 The most widely used DNA in DNA/AuNPs includes single stranded linear
DNA (ssDNA) and secondary structure-rich DNA, such as aptamers.8−12 Aptamers can undergo substantial structural changes upon target
binding or preassemble certain secondary structures to fit a target.12−14 Generally, DNA is self-assembled onto AuNP directly via thiol–Au
linkage, then assuming the bases available for hybridization to their
complement or for target binding. However, many studies have demonstrated
that the proper function of DNA/AuNP highly depends on the right conformation
of DNA.15−20 Therefore, it is of considerable interest to know more about the
conformation nature of DNA on AuNP surfaces.

The self-assembled
alkanethiol monolayer on gold has been demonstrated
to be highly labile, and the defects migrate across the surface.21 The recent studies have shown that DNA tends
to adsorb to gold surfaces through the interaction between bases and
Au.16,22,23 The conformation
of DNA on Au surfaces is rather complicated. Even though the DNA conformation
on flat Au surfaces has been studied using many techniques such as
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ellipsometry, radioisotopic
techniques, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM).15,24 The effect of surface curvature has to be
taken into account, and the results obtained for planar Au surfaces
may not be applied to spherical AuNPs.25−27 However, the study of
the DNA conformation on the surfaces of AuNPs was quite limited due
to the lack of the suitable characterization techniques.16,23

Gel electrophoresis has been reported to probe the conformation
of DNA on the surfaces of AuNPs.23 According
to the effective diameter of the DNA/AuNP derived from the electrophoretic
mobility of these conjugates, three conformations of DNA at low, medium,
to high capacity were proposed: the wrap-around, random coiled, and
fully stretched conformations, respectively.23 The wrap-around conformation favors the decease of the surface energy
of AuNP, and in contrast, the stretched conformation favors the increase
of entropy. The wrap-around conformation of DNA at the low surface
coverage has been widely accepted and evidenced by other techniques.28 However, from the free energy point of view,
the random coiled shape is not the most free energy favored conformation.
It is also hard to understand how the wrap-around conformation is
transformed to the stretched conformations as the capacity is increased.

Here, we propose a more stable conformation, referred to as a dynamic
inner-layer and outer-tail (DILOT) conformation, to describe the conformational
evolution of DNA on AuNP (Figure 1). The DILOT
conformation consists of an inner single oligonucleotide monolayer
and a stretched section pointing perpendicular to the surface. Under
the same immobilization conditions, the longer DNA possess the longer
stretched tails to balance between enthalpic and entropic forces in
DNA/gold monolayer self-assembly (Figure 1A).
During the DNA immobilization process, the AuNP should be always coated
by an inner layer to maintain the lowest surface energy until it is
completely replaced by the Au–S layer. With the increase of
the DNA loadings, the extended tails of DNA become longer and longer
as more and more of the DNA bases are away from the surface of AuNP
(Figure 1B).

Figure 1 Proposed dynamic inner-layer and outer-tail
(DILOT) conformation
model of the thiolated linear DNA on the surface of AuNP as shown
(A) with varied chain lengths and (B) in the typical aging-salting
thiolated DNA/AuNP preparation procedure. The conformations of aptamers
in the aptamer/AuNP preparation process are depicted in C. Their conformation
still follows the DILOT model when the salt concentration is lower
than the critical salt concentration [Na+]c.
When the salt concentration is higher than [Na+]c, the aptamers are folded on the surfaces. The conformation of the
nonthiolated DNA on AuNP is shown in A to demonstrate its difference
with DILOT conformation.

In order to find out if the DILOT conformation is reasonable,
the
kinetic adsorption profile was acquired. Such a kinetic study requires
the continuous acquiring of the conformation related information,
which is beyond the capability of most common techniques. Gel electrophoresis
would be rather expensive, tedious, and time-consuming. In order to
get an estimate about the accuracy of the data, gels of different
percentages have to be compared.29 In addition,
gel electrophoresis is not able to provide the single-strand resolution
for shorter DNA (less than 40-mer) that have more practical applications
than the longer ones. Moreover, the surfaces of AuNPs need to be precoated
with triphenyl phosphine sulfonate (TPPS) to enhance the stability
of the conjugates to avoid aggregation in the gel. However, the pretreatment
of AuNPs with TPPS may affect the conformation of DNA. Aptamers could
fold into more compact structures, which strongly affects the electrophoretic
mobility of the conjugate on the gel and then make the conformation
study rather difficult. Thus, it is highly desired to have a more
efficient and accurate way to kinetically probe the conformation of
DNA on the surfaces of AuNPs.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
is a label free and completely noninvasive
technique routinely used to analyze the hydrodynamic size (Dh) and size distribution of polymers, proteins,
colloids, and nanoparticles in homogeneously dispersed solution and
for the sensitive detection of the protein,30,31 DNA,32 and environmental pollutant.30,33−35 The technique is based on the Brownian motion of
spherical particles in suspension that causes laser light to be scattered
at greater angles and intensities for the larger particles. Analysis
of these intensity fluctuations yields the translational diffusion
coefficient and hence the Dh using the
Stokes–Einstein relationship. DLS has been demonstrated to
be a sensitive probe to directly measure the changes in particle size
during functionalization of AuNPs with thiol-ssDNA and hybridization.19,28,36 Recently, DLS has been reported
for the study of kinetic immobilization of protein and its conformation
on AuNPs.37 DNA has homogeneous charge
and relatively limited chemical and conformational complexity compared
to proteins, providing the great opportunity to study the conformation
of them on AuNPs by analyzing the Dh of
the conjugates. In this study, for the first time, we use DLS as a
sensitive and efficient probe to achieve the kinetic adsorption profile
of linear DNA and aptamers on the surface of AuNPs in the typical
three-step (aging, salting, and incubation) immobilization process
invented by Mirkin (Figure 2 caption).4,38 Even though several more efficient immobilization protocols have
recently been reported,39,40 the three-step process
is still the most widely used protocol.

Figure 2 Kinetic measurements
of the Dh values
of polyA/AuNP during the typical aging-salting preparation procedure.
The molar ratios of polyA’s to AuNPs were all 500:1. The procedure
includes the aging step (without adding NaCl, from 0 to 17 h), the
salting step (stepwise adding 1 M NaCl phosphate buffer to gradually
increase the concentration of NaCl up to 0.3 M, from 17 to 28 h),
and the incubation step (without a further increase of NaCl concentration,
from 28 to 40 h). The dotted line represents the NaCl concentration
of the sample in the procedure. The inset figures showed the Dh of the conjugates in the first hour of the
procedure. The errors were calculated from the three repeated measurements.

Experimental Section
Materials
Gold(III)
chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), dithiothreitol
(DTT), and triethylamine
(TEA) were purchased from J&K Scientific LTD (Peking, China).
All oligonucleotides (Table S-1) were synthesized
and purified through HPLC by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
NAP-5 columns (Sephadex G-25 Medium, DNA grade) were purchased from
Pharmacia Biotech (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). ZEN0117-disposable
low volume cuvettes (100 μL) were purchased from Malvern Instruments
Ltd. (Malvern, England). Millipore H2O purified with a
Millipore ultrapure water system was used throughout the experiments.
The bare AuNPs (13.0 ± 0.4 nm in diameter measured by transmission
electron microscope, Figure S-1) were in-house
prepared following the literature protocols.41 Through the immobilization process, the polydispersity of the DNA/AuNP
conjugates was all in the range from 0.17 to 0.28, indicating their
good quality and narrow distribution for the cumulants analysis.

DLS Measurements
The DLS measurements of the DNA/AuNPs
were conducted using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
England) equipped with a red (633 nm) laser and an avalanche photodiode
detector (APD). A ZEN0117-disposable low volume cuvette (100 μL)
was used as the sample container. The solution viscosity was set as
0.8872 cP, which is the dynamic viscosity of water at 25 °C.
The solution refractive index was set as 1.330, which is the refractive
index of water at 25 °C with the light wavelength at 633 nm.
The medium used in this study is an aqueous solution and has a similar
viscosity and refractive index to those for water (see CRC
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics). Both the solution refractive
index and the dynamic viscosity are required for the calculation of
the hydrodynamic size of the particles. All experiments were performed
in the water dispersant state at 25 °C with a 10 s equilibration
time and 90° measurement angle. Each measurement was taken by
conducting 20 runs, and each run took 10 s. The intensity weighted
harmonic mean size, Z-average size, is used for the whole study due
to its high reliability. The three repeated measurements for each
sample were carried out to estimate the errors of the measurements.
During the immobilization process of thiolated DNA on AuNPs, the concentration
of AuNPs was gradually decreased during the salt adding step due to
the stepwise addition of salt solution, commonly in the concentration
range from the initial ∼5 to 3 nM. The concentration of AuNPs
in this range has no significant effect on the values of the DLS measurements.

Results and Discussion
Kinetic DLS Measurements
The thiolated
polyadenine
(polyA) with varied lengths (polyA15, polyA30, polyA44, and polyA51, Table 1) has been chosen as an example to study the conformation
of linear DNA on the surface of AuNPs. PolyA’s have been widely
used as the spacers or the spacing block in DNA probes in the preparation
of DNA/AuNP. The study of the conformation of polyA’s could
also provide useful information for probe design. The four well-known
aptamers (thrombin aptamer TBA44, TBA30, and
cocaine aptamer CBA45, CBA51, Table 1) as the examples for secondary structure-rich DNA,
were chosen to examine their conformation on the surface of AuNPs
by directly comparing them to the polyA with the same length. In this
study, the molar ratios between the thiolated DNA and AuNP were all
500:1 to ensure the good stability of the complex during the immobilization
process and to achieve the high surface coverage of AuNPs (Figure S-2).

The Dh increases of the four polyA/AuNP
conjugates during the preparation process all follow a similar trend
and include three stages, corresponding to the aging, salting, and
incubation step, respectively (Figure 2). The
overall Dh increase of polyA/AuNPs after
the whole immobilization process was set as 100%. The 28.1 ±
4% and 90.6 ± 2% of the Dh increase
was obtained after the aging and salting step, respectively. During
the aging stage, the Dh increase included
the two phases: the rapid increase in the first 20 min and the slow
increase after that (Figure 1, inset). The
longer polyA took a longer time to reach level-off than the shorter
ones in the aging stage. For instance, for polyA15, 80%
of the Dh increase during the aging step
was observed after only 20 min incubation, and no further increase
was observed after 2 h of incubation. In contrast, for polyA44 and polyA51, no saturation was observed even after 17
h of incubation.

Previous studies have shown that polyA containing
consecutive adenines
preferentially adsorb on Au with high affinity.42 Surprisingly, the aptamers showed almost the same adsorption
kinetics in the aging step as polyA’s with the same length
(Figure 3), implying that the base composition
of DNA had no influence on the adsorption kinetics in the aging step.
The results indicate that the linear DNA and aptamers should possess
the same conformation during the aging step. Both for polyA’s
and aptamers, as the NaCl concentration increased, the Dh of DNA/AuNP continuously increased, which was in good
agreement with literature reports that the increased concentrations
of Na+ decreased the static electronic repulsion between
the negative surface charged AuNPs and the DNA, and thus more DNA
were able to be immobilized on the AuNPs.43 Interestingly, a much smaller Dh increase
of aptamer/AuNP in the salting and incubation step was observed compared
to polyA/AuNP with the same length starting from a certain salt concentration,
referred to as the critical salt concentration [Na+]c, suggesting that the conformation of the aptamers is significantly
different from that of polyA’s when the salt concentration
is higher than [Na+]c. Above [Na+]c, the aptamers may experience the formation of a compact
secondary structure, resulting in difficulty in their conformation
analysis. Therefore, the conformation of polyA’s in the aging
step was first examined.

of the polyA’s (polyA30, polyA44, and
polyA51)/AuNP and aptamers (TBA30, TBA44, CBA45, CBA51)/AuNP in the preparation procedure.
The dotted line represents the NaCl concentration in the procedure.

The Dh values of the polyA/AuNP provide
valuable information on the conformational state of polyA’s.
At the end of the aging step, the Dh of
the conjugates increased 1.5, 2.8, 5.2, and 5.9 nm in the presence
of polyA15, polyA30, polyA44, and
polyA51, respectively, which were all significantly smaller
than the estimated Dh at the stretched
conformation (27.7, 40.6, 52.7, and 58.7 nm, respectively) but greater
than the diameter of polyA (∼1 nm). The stretched length of
polyA can be estimated as follows.23 The
extension of the DNA comprised 0.92 nm, accounting for the thiol group
at the 5′ end, which is linked by a carbohydrate spacer of
six carbon atoms. In the case of stretched DNA, the length of single
stranded DNA can be estimated by assuming a value of 0.43 nm per base.
The estimated Dh of the polyA/AuNP at
the stretched conformation is assumed to be the sum of the 13 nm diameter
of the bare AuNP and 2 times the extension of the DNA molecules. The
results suggested that the conformation of polyA’s with varied
length at the end of the aging step was neither the wrap-around state
nor the stretched conformation.

To get more information on the
conformation state of the polyA’s,
a direct comparison of the adsorption kinetics between the thiolated
and nonthiolated polyA’s was conducted. It has been reported
that the shorter DNA tend to adsorb on AuNPs faster than the longer
ones.44−46 However, such a conclusion was experimentally obtained
under the conditions where the concentration of DNA was quite low
(in the low nM range) and the molar ratio between DNA and AuNP was
very low.44,45 When DNA was at the large excess amount
and at high concentrations like we used in this study, no kinetic
adsorption preference of the shorter DNA was observed (Figure S-3). The adsorption kinetics of nonthiolated
polyA’s was all quite fast and similar. The Dh’s of conjugates all reached the level-off within
20 min. Interestingly, regardless of the lengths of polyA’s,
the level-off Dh increases were all around
1.0 nm, which is close to the diameter of polyA’s, suggesting
that the nonthiolated polyA’s with varied length were all wrapped
around the particles and there was no significant extension from the
surface of AuNPs (Figure 1A). Similar results
were also obtained by Cardenas et al.28

Kinetic Model of the Adsorption Process in the Aging Step Supports
the DILOT Conformation
The clear difference in adsorption
kinetics between the thiolated and nonthiolated polyA’s on
AuNPs reflects their different binding mechanism. The latter involves
a fast single step nonspecific adsorption, leading to the formation
of a monolayer to substantially decrease the surface free energy of
AuNPs. In contrast, the adsorption mechanism of the thiolated polyA’s
on AuNPs involves a fast nonspecific adsorption and a slow specific
adsorption. The nonspecific adsorption is the same as the adsorption
of nonthiolated polyA, resulting in a rapid formation of a single
oligonucleotide monolayer. The stronger thiol–Au interaction
is also involved at the same time, resulting in a much greater Dh increase in the first 20 min compared to that
of the nonthiolated polyA/AuNPs conjugates. As this monolayer approaches
saturation, a much slower immobilization process that involves the
rearrangement of the anchored strands and insertion of the new strands
controls the kinetics. Very interestingly, the kinetic increases of
the particle sizes were modeled accurately by the pseudo-second-order
rate model as we have shown below, suggesting that DNA could have
the statistically well-defined conformational evolution.

Specifically,
there are two typical adsorption kinetic models on the liquid–solid
interface, the Lagergren-first-order rate and pseudo second-order
rate model.47 An adsorption process involving
electron transfer is commonly well fit to the pseudo second-order
rate model. Theoretically, the adsorption kinetics of thiolated DNA
on AuNPs should fit the pseudo-second-order rate model better. If
the DILOT model (Figure 1) is correct, every
strand on the AuNP would reorganize its conformation and lift the
wrap-around section away from the surface of AuNP with statistically
the same distance as the adsorption of each strand. Therefore, the Dh increase would be proportional to the sorption
capacity (or the amount of substance adsorbed) in a certain capacity
range. The linear capacity range should be greater at the higher surface
coverage since the contribution of every strand on AuNP on the Dh increase becomes smaller. Thus, the two kinetic
models can be conveniently expressed in the changes of Dh over incubation time. The detailed derivation of the
equations was described in the Supporting Information.

Based on eqs 8 and 9 as shown in the Supporting
Information, curve fitting of the polyA adsorption kinetic
data in the aging step was performed (Figure 4, Figure S-4), and the parameters in the
models and regression coefficients (R2) for the two kinetic models were obtained (Table 1).47 The Lagergren-first-order
rate constant Kf and de1 (the Dh increases caused
by adsorption of DNA on AuNP at equilibrium) can be determined from
the slope and intercept of the plot obtained by plotting log(de1 – dt)
versus t (Figure S-4);
the pseudo-second-order rate constant Ks′ and de2 (the Dh increases caused by adsorption of DNA on AuNP at equilibrium)
can be determined from the intercept and slope of the plot obtained
by plotting t/dt versus t (Figure 4A). The calculated de2 values of the pseudo-second-order rate equation
are perfectly the same as the experimental de2 values. In contrast, the calculated de1 values of Lagergren-first-order rate equation are far away
from the experimental values. The correlation coefficients (R2) for the pseudo-second-order rate model obtained
for the studied DNA were all extremely high (above 0.996). Thus, the
adsorption process in the aging step followed the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model, which is in good agreement with the adsorption mechanism
of the thiolated DNA where the rate-limiting step is chemical adsorption
involving valency forces through sharing or exchange of electrons
between the thiolated DNA and AuNPs.48 The
Au–S interaction is much stronger than the nonspecific interaction
between Au and the bases of DNA, and therefore no base differentiation
on the adsorption kinetics in the aging step was observed (Figure 3). The almost perfect fitting of the Dh increase of polyA/AuNP conjugates as the function of
incubation time in the pseudo-second-order equation supports our proposed
DILOT conformation model.

Figure 4 (A) Pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics
of thiolated polyA’s
onto AuNPs in the aging step and (B) the low power exponential relationship
between of the adsorption rate constant Ks and the length of the thiolated polyA’s.

The length of the thiolated polyA’s
has a strong effect
on the adsorption rate constant Ks′.
As shown in Figure 4B, Ks′ shows a low power exponential function of the length
of DNA (y = 2217x–2.32) with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. For example, the Ks′ of polyA15 is around 20
times greater than that of polyA51, suggesting a much faster
adsorption rate of polyA15 than polyA51. Please
remember that the preparation process is not a diffusion controlled
process under the conditions we used here, and merely the size of
polyA’s will not cause the decrease of Ks′. The results also well support the DILOT conformation
since the longer DNA tends to adsorb on the surface of AuNPs with
more binding sites and therefore with higher affinity, resulting in
the slower rearrangement and insertion kinetics.

On the other
hand, according to the DILOT model we hypothesized
the proportional relationship between the Dh and the capacity of polyA on AuNPs in the equation derivation. As
we expected, there was indeed a nice linear relationship (R2 = 0.996) between the Dh and the number of the FAM labeled polyA30 in the
aging step (Figure S-5). The florescent
labeled polyA30 was used to acquire the higher accuracy
in capacity quantification. Interestingly, Alivisatos and Parak also
reported the linear relationship between the number of DNA per particle
and the effective diameters of DNA/AuNP conjugates at the low DNA
capacities (up to seven strands per particle for 43 and 100 bases
DNA).23,29 The results also well support the DILOT
model.

DILOT Conformation also Works for the Salting and Incubation
Step
From above, we demonstrated that the DILOT model can
describe the conformation of linear DNA in the aging step very well.
Now the question is if the DILOT model also works for the linear DNA
in the salting and incubation step. To answer this question, we made
a back of envelope calculation. Specifically, the final Dh’s of polyA15, polyA30,
polyA44, and polyA51/AuNPs at the end of the
preparation process in 10 mM phosphate buffer (PB)/0.3 M NaCl were
25.2 ± 0.1, 31.3 ± 0.1, 36.0 ± 0.4, and 37.6 ±
0.4 nm, respectively. To remove the salt effect on Dh, the conjugates were centrifuged and resuspended in
10 mM PB. The final Dh’s of them
were 25.8 ± 0.1, 32.7 ± 0.1, 38.0 ± 0.1, and 41.9 ±
0.4 nm, respectively (Figure S-6). These
values were all significantly smaller than the estimated diameters
in the case of stretched DNA (27.7, 40.6, 52.7, and 58.7 nm, respectively),
suggesting that the strands were still not fully stretched. Compared
to the longer ones, the shorter polyA’s were more stretched.
These data are in good agreement with the reported effective diameters
derived from gel electrophoresis.23 In
order to provide more conformation information on polyA’s,
taking polyA30 as an example, we measured its surface capacity
during the salting and incubation step. Interestingly, we found that
the Dh’s in PB were in a linear
relationship with the number of polyA’s per particle in the
medium and high capacity range (28–65 and 65–125 strands
per particle, R2 = 0.991 and 0.988, respectively),
suggesting the conformation of DNA should still fit the DILOT model
(Figure S-7). Exactly as we expect, the
slopes of the curves gradually decrease as the surface capacity increases:
0.1779, 0.151, and 0.049 nm/strand, in the low, medium, and high capacity
range, respectively, as shown in Figures S-5 and
S-7. The linear capacity ranges also become greater at a higher
surface coverage: 22–28.5, 28.5–65, and 65–125
strands per particle. These trends can all be well explained by the
DILOT model. The addition of each strand on the Au surface requires
the reorganization of all strands on AuNP and the lift-off of the
wrapped-around section away from the surface of AuNPs with the statistically
same length. Clearly, the lift-off length of every strand on AuNP
on the Dh increase becomes smaller as
the surface capacity increases, corresponding to the smaller curve
slope and greater linear capacity range. In Figure
S-7, we noticed another interesting phenomenon that the slope
of the curve (0.151 nm/strand) in the medium capacity range is much
greater than that in the high capacity range (0.049 nm/strand). It
seems hard to understand. However, please note the significantly varied
salt concentration in the salting and incubation step. It has been
reported that the desorption rate of DNA on AuNPs increases as the
salt concentration increases.44 With high
salt, the DNA internal charges are screened to allow for more compact
structures on the AuNP surface, reducing the number of contacting
points and facilitating desorption. The increase of the desorption
rate certainly favors the displacement of the wrapped-around section
of DNA and causes the greater Dh increase
per strand. As the surface capacity increases, the adsorbed length
per DNA becomes shorter and shorter and the salt impact on the desorption
rate becomes weaker and weaker. In addition, the DILOT conformation
can also explain the effects of salt concentration, spacer composition,
and sonication on the DNA loading on AuNPs. High salt concentration,
a spacer with weak affinity to AuNPs, and sonication all can effectively
weaken the inner wrapped-around section of DNA and favor the higher
loading of DNA on AuNPs.43

As demonstrated
above, we found that the DILOT model can be used to describe the conformation
of linear DNA on the surface of AuNPs during the complete preparation
procedure. The evolution of the conformation of linear DNA in the
preparation process is depicted in Figure 1B. Thus, during the whole preparation process, the AuNPs should be
always coated by the inner layer to maintain the lowest surface energy
until the end of incubation. We further confirmed the existence of
the inner layer even at the end of the incubation step by mixing the
conjugates with 0.01 mM mecaptohexanol. The Dh of the conjugates increased from 32.3 to 35.3 nm after 30
min incubation, and the smaller mobility was also observed on the
gel electrophoresis (Figure S-8). The results
were in good agreement with the literature report.16 A detailed discussion can be found in the Supporting Information.

The Application of the
DILOT Conformation
As the capacity
increased, the extended tails of DNA became longer and longer as more
and more of the DNA bases were away from the surface of AuNPs. Specifically,
according to the DILOT conformation model, the base number (N) of the extended tail can be calculated using the following
equation:  where Dh is the
hydrodynamic size (nm) of the DNA/AuNP, DAu is the diameter (nm) of AuNP, and In is the thickness of the inner layer (0.5 nm) of
the DNA/AuNP.

Thus, the base numbers of the extended tail are
13.7, 21.7, 27.9, and 32.4 bases for of polyA15, polyA30, polyA44, and polyA51/AuNPs, respectively.
These results have implications for the probe design to achieve the
effective hybridization and molecular recognition. For example, when
AuNP is fully covered with DNA of 44 bases length as effective building
blocks, the inner 16 bases are wrapped around the surface of Au and
are not effective for hybridization. The longer probes need the longer
spacer to avoid the blocking of the molecular recognition site on
the surface of AuNPs.

Conformation of Aptamers on AuNPs
In case of aptamers,
as shown in Figure 3, the conformational transition
of aptamers can be divided into two stages during the whole preparation
process: the low and the high salt concentration stages, respectively.
In the low salt concentration stage, the kinetic curves of the Dh increases of aptamer/AuNP are almost completely
overlapped with those of the ployA/AuNP with the same lengths, suggesting
that the conformational transition of aptamers in this stage can be
described by the DILOT model. However, when the salt concentration
reaches the critical salt concentration [Na+]c, the kinetic curves of the aptamer/AuNP and polyA/AuNP separated
from each other and the much smaller Dh increases of aptamer/AuNP conjugates than those of the polyA’s/AuNP
conjugates were observed. The aptamers with the more negative of the
free energy (ΔG) for their
secondary structure formation have a lower [Na+]c (Figure 3). For example, CBA51/AuNP possesses the lowest [Na+]c among these
four aptamer/AuNP conjugates due to the highest stability of the folded
structure of CBA51. The results suggested that the folding
of aptamers plays a significant role in surface immobilization.

The much smaller Dh decrease of aptamer/AuNP
conjugates compared to that of polyA/AuNP conjugates is attributed
to the folding of aptamers, but not the lesser surface capacity. We
experimentally measured the capacity of polyA/AuNP and aptamer/AuNP
conjugates by UV–vis measurements. As shown in Figure S-9, the capacities of aptamers were all
much higher than those of the polyA’s with the same lengths.
The results are quite understandable since the folding of aptamers
causes less steric hindrance, easier strand displacement, and more
unoccupied area on the surface of AuNPs compared to the linear DNA
with the same lengths. Thus, the capacities of aptamers should be
significantly higher than those of the linear DNA with the same lengths.
The higher capacities of aptamers on AuNPs were also confirmed by
their slower migration rates than those of polyA/AuNPs.23 The conformational effect on the capacity on
AuNPs was also evidenced by others’ reports. For example, it
was found that there were ∼180 adenosine aptamers (27 mer)
on each AuNP, which was also significantly higher than linear DNA
with a similar length.19 Adenosine aptamers
can fold into a duplex conformation at a certain salt concentration
and therefore significantly decrease the steric hindrance on surface
of AuNPs. In addition, the different secondary structure of the aptamer
could possess different steric hindrance on the surface of AuNPs and
therefore affect the saturation coverage of them quite differently.
For example, the two-dimensional Y shape conformation of cocaine aptamers
(CBA45 and CBA51) showed a smaller steric hindrance
than the three-dimensional G-quartette structure of thrombin aptamers
(TBA30 and TBA44), resulting in their much higher
probe densities. Moreover, the stability of the folded structure of
aptamers also has an impact on the saturation coverage of them. For
instance, the probe density of CBA51/AuNPs was even higher
than that of CBA45/AuNPs.

Clearly, the DILOT model
is not suitable to describe the conformation
of aptamers when the salt concentration is higher than the [Na+]c. The inner layer may be partially or fully interrupted
due to the involvement of bases in the formation of the secondary
structure by base pairing, which may be attributed to the decreased
stability of the conjugates, the increased nonspecific adsorption,
and the failure of the conjugate preparation as reported in several
works.20,49,50 These results
have implications for effective preparation of aptamer/AuNP conjugates
and their applications in molecular recognition. For example, it is
necessary and critical to add the spacer at the immobilization end
of the aptamer to keep the good stability of the aptamer/AuNP conjugates
in the salting step and to make the aptamer available for molecular
recognition. The spacer does not involve the folding of the aptamer
and therefore can maintain the inner layer of the conjugates when
the salt concentration is higher than the [Na+]c. In addition, the high capacity of aptamers on AuNPs may also hinder
or even prevent the molecular recognition.

Conclusions
We
conclude that the DNA on the surface of AuNPs always possesses
the DILOT conformation after the initial formation of the inner layer
when no folding of DNA is involved. The AuNPs are always coated by
the inner layer to maintain the lowest surface energy until it is
completely replaced by Au–S layer. As the capacity increased,
the extended tails of DNA became longer and longer as more and more
of the DNA bases were away from the surface of AuNPs. However, in
the case of aptamers, when the salt concentration exceeds the [Na+]c, the aptamers on the surface of AuNPs start
to partially fold into their secondary structures, and the DILOT conformation
model does not work anymore.

The DILOT conformation model is
clearly different from the random
coiled conformation at the medium probe density proposed by other
researchers. Even though the DILOT model was proposed using 13 nm
diameter AuNPs as the model system, the model should be able to apply
to other sized AuNPs since the surface interactions are similar. The
linear DNA used in this study is polyA’s with the length from
15 to 51-mer. We believe that the longer or shorter ones should also
follow a similar trend in their conformational changes on AuNPs. We
demonstrated the strong impact of the folding of aptamers on their
immobilization on AuNPs. The immobilization of molecular beacons or
other secondary structure-rich DNA should be similar to that of aptamers.
The results reported in this work have implications for effective
hybridization, molecular recognition to the conjugates, and DNA-directed
nanoparticle assembly. In addition, for the first time we demonstrated
that DLS was a facile and powerful tool for the surface interaction
study of DNA/AuNP systems. DLS could also be applied to other types
of nanomaterials and in various kinetic studies on the surface of
the nanoparticles such as enzymatic reaction kinetics, protein–DNA/RNA
interactions, and so on.
