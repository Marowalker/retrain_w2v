The development of simple fluorescent
and colorimetric assays that
enable point-of-care DNA and RNA detection has been a topic of significant
research because of the utility of such assays in resource limited
settings. The most common motifs utilize hybridization to a complementary
detection strand coupled with a sensitive reporter molecule. Here,
a paper-based colorimetric assay for DNA detection based on pyrrolidinyl
peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-induced nanoparticle aggregation is
reported as an alternative to traditional colorimetric approaches.
PNA probes are an attractive alternative to DNA and RNA probes because
they are chemically and biologically stable, easily synthesized, and
hybridize efficiently with the complementary DNA strands. The acpcPNA
probe contains a single positive charge from the lysine at C-terminus
and causes aggregation of citrate anion-stabilized silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) in the absence of complementary DNA. In the presence of target
DNA, formation of the anionic DNA-acpcPNA duplex results in dispersion
of the AgNPs as a result of electrostatic repulsion, giving rise to
a detectable color change. Factors affecting the sensitivity and selectivity
of this assay were investigated, including ionic strength, AgNP concentration,
PNA concentration, and DNA strand mismatches. The method was used
for screening of synthetic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA based on a colorimetric
paper-based analytical device developed using the aforementioned principle.
The oligonucleotide targets were detected by measuring the color change
of AgNPs, giving detection limits of 1.53 (MERS-CoV), 1.27 (MTB),
and 1.03 nM (HPV). The acpcPNA probe exhibited high selectivity for
the complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch,
and noncomplementary DNA targets. The proposed paper-based colorimetric
DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative approach for simple,
rapid, sensitive, and selective DNA detection.

==== Body
Infectious diseases represent
a major threat to human health in developed and developing countries
alike. DNA alterations contribute to different types of diseases;
therefore, the detection of specific DNA sequences plays a crucial
role in the development method for early stage treatment and monitoring
of genetic-related diseases. DNA diagnostics can provide sequence-specific
detection, especially for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),1 which critical for a range of applications including
the diagnosis of human diseases and bacterial/viral infections.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), tuberculosis (TB), and
cervical cancers related to human papilloma virus (HPV) are examples
of infectious diseases caused by bacterial and viral infections that
benefit greatly from DNA detection. TB is an infectious disease caused
by mycobacteria, usually M. tuberculosis (MTB) in humans.2 HPV has been shown
to be a major cause of cervical cancer.3 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently
emerged as an infectious disease with a high fatality rate in humans.4 Diagnostic methods developed for these infectious
diseases include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
for MERS-CoV,5 sputum smear microscopy,
culture of bacilli, and molecular species diagnostics for MTB6−11 and Digene Hybrid Capture assay (HC2) and Pap smear test for HPV.12,13 While these techniques have been used for successful detection,
they are difficult to implement in point-of-care clinical diagnostics
particularly in developing countries lacking specialized medical facilities
and skilled personnel. Therefore, simple, rapid, low-cost, and highly
accurate on-site diagnostic platforms amenable to nucleic acid detection
remain a challenge for early detection of infectious diseases for
better patient management and infection control. Although DNA amplification
is still needed with the current method to provide high sensitivity,
we seek to further improve selectivity and assay simplicity to give
immediate and quantitative responses in resource limited settings.

Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are a point-of-use technology
that recently received renewed interest because they are simple, inexpensive,
portable, and disposable.14−16 To date, PADs have been extensively
used for applications ranging from environmental analysis to clinical
diagnostic assays.15,17,18 Colorimetric assays are particularly attractive when coupled with
PADs due to their ease-of-use, lack of complicated external equipment
and ability to provide semiquantitative results.19−21 Moreover, quantitative
analysis of colorimetric assays can be accomplished using simple optical
technologies such as digital cameras22−24 and office scanners20,25 combined with image processing software to carry out color, hue,
and intensity measurements. In the field of clinical diagnostics,
the advantages of simplicity, sensitivity, and low-cost are key reasons
that make PADs coupled with colorimetric detection an effective diagnostic
tool relative to traditional methods.

Colorimetric assays based
on the aggregation of silver (AgNPs)
and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted increasing attention
in biomedical applications. The optical properties of these nanomaterials
depend on their size and shape.26−31 AgNPs are known to have a higher extinction coefficient compared
to AuNPs,32−34 leading to improved optical sensitivity. Chemical
reduction of silver salts is frequently used to synthesize AgNPs;
while specific control of shape and size distribution is achieved
by varying the reducing agents and stabilizers.35−37 Among stabilizing
agents, negatively charged citrate has been widely used.38,39 Recently, colorimetric assays based on AgNPs aggregation for DNA
detection has been reported.34 Colorimetric
DNA detection using AgNPs usually involves modifying the particles
with a DNA probe and mixing them with the DNA target containing the
complementary sequence. When the hybridization of probe and target
DNA occurs, the AgNPs aggregate and change color.33,34 The assay principal has been further adopted using charge-neutral
peptide nucleic acids (PNA)40,41 as the hybridization
agent. PNA causes aggregation of metal nanoparticles in solution without
immobilization, thus, simplifying the assay.42,43 Finally, PNA-based nanoparticle aggregation assays also provide
a high hybridization efficiency of PNA-DNA duplexes leading to a rapid
color change.43

Recently, Vilaivan’s
group proposed a new conformationally
constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA system which possesses an α,β-peptide
backbone derived from d-proline/2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic
acid (known as acpcPNA).44,45 Compared to Nielsen’s
PNA,40 acpcPNA exhibits a stronger affinity
and higher sequence specificity binding to DNA. acpcPNA exhibits the
characteristic selectivity of antiparallel binding to the target DNA
and low tendency to self-hybridize. Moreover, the nucleobases and
backbone of acpcPNA can be modified to increase molecular functionality.
These combined properties make acpcPNA an attractive candidate as
a probe for biological applications.46−48

Here, the multiplex
colorimetric PAD for DNA detection based on
the aggregation of AgNPs induced by acpcPNA is reported. acpcPNA bearing
a positively charged lysine modification at C-terminus was designed
as the probe. The cationic PNA probe can interact with the negatively
charged AgNPs leading to nanoparticle aggregation and a significant
color change. This proposed sensor was used for simultaneous detection
of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV. The developed paper-based DNA sensor has
potential as an alternative diagnostic device for simple, rapid, sensitive,
and selective DNA/RNA detection.

Synthesis of AgNPs
The AgNPs were
synthesized using
the citrate-stabilization method.49 Briefly,
4 mL of 12.6 mM sodium citrate and 50 mL of 0.3 mM AgNO3 were mixed together. Then, 1 mL of 37 mM NaBH4 was added
to the mixture under vigorous stirring and the solution turned yellow.
The formation of AgNPs and their size distribution were verified by
dynamic light scattering measurement, and the average size of AgNPs
was found to be 19 nm (Figure S1).

Synthesis
of acpcPNA Probes
The acpcPNA probes were
designed to detect the synthetic oligonucleotide targets with sequences
corresponding to MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV type 16. The sequences of
acpcPNA probes are as follows:

MERS-CoV: CTCTTCACATAATCG-LysNH2

MTB: CAAGAAACACGTTAT-LysNH2

HPV type
16: CATACACCTCCAGC-LysNH2

*(written in the N →
C direction)

The acpcPNA probe was synthesized by solid-phase
peptide synthesis
using Fmoc chemistry, as previously described.44 At the C-terminus, lysinamide was included as a positively
charged group that could induce nanoparticle aggregation. All PNA
were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (C18 column, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in H2O–MeOH gradient). The identity of
the acpcPNA was verified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Figure S2), and the purity was confirmed to be >90% by
reverse-phase
HPLC.

Design and Operation of Paper-Based Multiplex DNA Sensor
A wax-printing technique was used to create PADs.50 The sensor was designed using Adobe Illustrator. The wax
colors were selected to be complementary to the colorimetric reactions
to enhance visualization. For paper-based device fabrication, the
wax design was printed onto Whatman grade 1 filter paper (VWR) using
a wax printer (Xerox Phaser 8860). The wax pattern was subsequently
melted at 175 °C for 50 s to generate the hydrophobic barriers
and hydrophilic channels. The sensor was based on Origami concept
consisting of two layers.51,52 As shown in Scheme 1A, the base layer
contains four wax-defined channels extending outward from the sample
reservoir (6 mm i.d.) and the top layer contains four detection and
control zones (4 mm i.d.). Scheme 1B illustrates operation of the multiplex sensor. First,
the sample reservoir of the top layer was punched to provide a solution
connection directly from the top to the bottom layer, and then the
device was assembled by folding the top layer over the base layer
to create the three-dimension origami paper-based device. A polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) lid was used for holding the two layers together. The lid consisting
of one 6 mm diameter hole over the sample reservoir and eight 4 mm
diameter holes over the colorimetric detection and control zones was
aligned over the device to provide consistent pressure across the
surface of the device. Next, the acpcPNA probe and AgNPs solution
were added onto the detection and control zones. Finally, the sample
solution was added onto the sample reservoir and flow through the
channels to wet the colorimetric detection zones.

Device
Colorimetric Detection
of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV DNA Target
According to the concept
of PNA-induced AgNPs aggregation,42,43 acpcPNA was
designed as a specific probe for quantitative detection
of synthetic MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV DNA targets. For colorimetric
detection, the detection zone was prepared by adding 10 μL of
AgNPs in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.4 in a ratio of
5:1 (AgNPs: PBS), followed by 1 μL of specific acpcPNA probe.
Control zones were prepared using the same conditions as the colorimetric
detection zones. Next, 25 μL of DNA target was added to the
open sample reservoir. Upon sample addition, solution moved outward
through the channels to wet the colorimetric detection zone of the
top layer. Finally, the AgNPs aggregation occurred and the color intensity
was measured.

Image Processing
The detection images
were recorded
using a scanner (XEROX DocuMate 3220) and saved in JPEG format at
600 dpi. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used
to analyze the mean intensity of the color for each colorimetric reaction
zone by applying a color threshold window for removing the blue background.
Images were then inverted, and the mean intensity was measured.20,53

Results and Discussion
acpcPNA-Induced AgNPs Aggregation
The process of acpcPNA-induced
AgNPs aggregation is shown in Scheme 2. The anionic AgNPs are initially well dispersed due
to electrostatic repulsion. On addition of the cationic acpcPNA, the
electrostatic repulsion is shielded, resulting in nanoparticle aggregation.
When complementary DNA (DNAcom) is present, the specific
PNA–DNA interaction outcompetes the less specific PNA–AgNPs
interaction, resulting in a negatively charged PNA–DNAcom duplex and deaggregation of the anionic nanoparticles.
Upon addition of noncomplementary DNA (DNAnc), the acpcPNA
should remain bound to the AgNPs and no color change occurs. To prove
the concept, we designed and synthesized acpcPNA probes to detect
synthetic oligonucleotide targets with sequences corresponding to
MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV type 16. The photographs of the results are
shown in Figure 1.
The yellow AgNPs turned red when the acpcPNA was added. When the solution
contained of the acpcPNA and DNAnc, the color also changed
to red due to aggregation of the AgNPs. On the other hand, the color
changed from red (aggregated) to yellow (nonaggregated) in the presence
of DNAcom, with the intensity dependent on the DNA concentration.
Next, the sequence of adding the PNA probe and DNA target was investigated.
As shown in Figure S3, when equimolar DNAcom was added either before or after the addition of acpcPNA
probe into the AgNPs, the same color intensities were obtained indicating
that the sequence of adding acpcPNA and DNAcom did not
impact the final signal.

in the Presence of DNAcom and DNAnc

from detection of MERS-CoV,
MTB, and HPV in the presence of DNAcom.

Critical Coagulation Concentration (CCC)
The influence
of electrolyte solution on the aggregation behavior of citrate-stabilized
AgNPs was investigated based on the CCC.54The CCC represents the electrolyte concentration required to cause
aggregation of the nanoparticles in the absence of acpcPNA. In Figure S4, the color intensity of citrate-stabilized
AgNPs in the absence of acpcPNA probe is shown as a function of NaCl
concentration. The intensity and, therefore, the degree of aggregation,
increased with the concentration of NaCl, indicating that increasing
ionic strength led to enhanced aggregation.55 We believe that the ionic strength can decrease the electrostatic
repulsion of citrate-stabilized AgNPs as a result of shielding, accelerating
the AgNPs aggregation. The CCC was obtained when the degree of aggregation
reached a maximum and became independent of NaCl concentration. In
this experiment, the CCC of citrate-stabilized AgNPs was found to
be 30 mM. Above this concentration, PNA-induced aggregation was not
observed.

Optimization of Assay Parameters
For a colorimetric
assay based on acpcPNA-induced AgNPs aggregation, assay parameters
including 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) ratio and acpcPNA concentration were
optimized using a simple paper-based design. The degree of AgNPs aggregation
was determined by measuring the color intensity of the resulting solution
in the presence of acpcPNA without target DNA. First, the impact of
the PBS concentration on AgNPs aggregation was measured. The differential
color intensity (Δ intensity, ΔI) obtained
before and after addition of acpcPNA as a function of AgNPs to PBS
ratio is shown in Figure 2A. ΔI increased until the ratio of
AgNPs/PBS reached 5:1 and then decreased until it plateaued at 5:2.
Thus, the ratio of 5:1 AgNPs/PBS was selected as the optimal condition
because it gave the largest ΔI. Another important
aspect for the DNA assay is probe concentration. The influence of
acpcPNA probe concentration on absolute intensity was studied. As
shown in Figure 2B,
the acpcPNA concentration was varied within a range of 0–2.5
μM, and the highest aggregation was obtained at the concentration
of 1.0 μM. At this concentration, the aggregation became independent
of acpcPNA concentration, which was desirable for simplifying the
assay. Higher concentrations of AgNPs were not tested in order to
minimize reagent consumption. As a result, the optimal conditions
consisting of AgNPs/PBS ratio of 5:1 and acpcPNA concentration of
1.0 μM were selected for further experiments.

Figure 2 Influence of (A) AgNPs/PBS
ratio and (B) acpcPNA probe concentration
on color intensity for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV detection. The error
bars represent one standard deviation (SD) obtained from three independent
measurements (n = 3).

Selectivity of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV Detection
To
investigate the selectivity of this system, the color intensity obtained
from the DNAcom of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV was compared
to that of single-base mismatch (DNAm1), two-base mismatch
(DNAm2), and DNAnc sequences. The color intensity
decreased significantly in the presence of DNAcom; whereas,
the intensity did not change for the mismatched and noncomplementary
targets (Figure 3).
We believe the affinity of PNA–DNA hybridization was reduced
due to the contribution of one- and two-base mismatches, leaving free
PNA to aggregate the nanoparticles. PNA–DNAcom complex
can retard the ability of PNA to induce AgNPs aggregation as discussed
above and result in different color intensities. These results suggest
that the fully complementary DNA selectively hybridized the acpcPNA
probe and yielded measurable signals. In addition, bovine serum albumin
(BSA), which is commonly used in cell culture protocols, was used
to investigate the protein interference of the proposed system. The
DNA target was prepared in the presence of 3% BSA solution. It was
observed that the color intensities of the DNA targets for MERS-CoV,
MTB, and HPV in 3% BSA solution were statistically identical to the
ones without BSA (Figure S5). Hence, common
proteins should not negatively affect the analysis of this system.

from three independent measurements (n = 3).

Analytical Performance
To assess the sensitivity of
the proposed method for DNA quantification, the intensity as a function
of the target DNA concentration was determined. The color intensity
decreases with the target DNA concentration. The calibration curves
for each species are shown in Figure 4A, B, and C for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV, respectively.
The linear range for each DNA target using a logarithmic DNA concentration
and color intensity (Figure 4, inset) was also obtained. The analytical performances for
all three DNA targets are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that a sufficiently low
detection limit could be obtained for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV detection
without the need for multiple PCR cycles. Moreover, this multiplex
system can provide sensitive and selective detection for simultaneous
analysis of multiple DNA targets in a single device, which simplifies
the analysis compared to traditional diagnostics.9,56−59

MTB	50–2500	1.27	0.12–0.67	
HPV	20–2500	1.03	0.43–0.93	
Device Design
Next, a multiplex device (Scheme 1) was designed for simultaneous
detection of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV. The top layer contained four
detection zones and four control zones. Each zone contained AgNPs
with a single acpcPNA probe to provide selectivity for DNA. The base
layer contained four wax-defined channels extending outward from a
sample inlet. After the device was folded and stacked together, the
channels of the base layer were connected to four detection zones
of the top layer. Upon sample addition, the solution moved outward
through the channels of the base layer to wet the colorimetric detection
zones of the top layer and lead to color change. Figure 5 illustrates the ability of
the proposed sensor for detection of 100 nM MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.
Only the colorimetric detection zones that contained the selective
probes changed color compared to their control zones. This result
indicated that the multiplex paper-based colorimetric sensor is promising
for simultaneous determination of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.

colorimetric PAD (1, C1= AgNPs + MERS-CoV acpcPNA probe;
2, C2 = AgNPs + MTB acpcPNA probe; 3, C3 = AgNPs
+ HPV acpcPNA probe).

Conclusions
A multiplex colorimetric PAD was developed
for simultaneous detection
of DNA associated with viral and bacterial infectious diseases, including
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus
(HPV). AgNPs were used as a colorimetric reagent for DNA detection
based on acpcPNA-induced nanoparticle aggregation. This colorimetric
DNA sensor exhibited high selectivity against single-base mismatch,
two-base mismatch and noncomplementary target DNA. Under the optimized
condition, the limit of detection for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV were
found to be 1.53, 1.27, and 1.03 nM, respectively. As a result, this
developed multiplex colorimetric PAD could be a low-cost and disposable
alternative tool for rapid screening and detecting in infectious diagnostics.
