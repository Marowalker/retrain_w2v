Glycosylated human
IgG contains fucosylated biantennary N-glycans with
different modifications including N-acetylglucosamine,
which bisects the mannose core. Although
only a limited number of IgG N-glycan structures
are possible, human IgG N-glycans are predominantly
biantennary and fucosylated and contain varying levels of α2–6-linked
sialic acid, galactose, and bisected N-acetylglucosamine.
Monitoring the relative abundance of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine
is relevant to physiological processes. A rapid, inexpensive, and
automated method is used to successfully profile N-linked IgG glycans
and is suitable to distinguish differences in bisection, galactosylation,
and sialylation in N-glycans derived from different
sources of human IgG. The separation is facilitated with self-assembled
nanogels that also contain a single stationary zone of lectin. When
the lectin specificity matches the N-glycan, the
peak disappears from the electropherogram, identifying the N-glycan structure. The nanogel electrophoresis generates
separation efficiencies of 500 000 plates and resolves the
positional isomers of monogalactosylated biantennary N-glycan and the monogalactosylated bisected N-glycan. Aleuria aurantia lectin, Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL), Sambucus nigra lectin, and Phaseolus vulgaris Erythroagglutinin (PHA-E) are used to
identify fucose, galactose, α2–6-linked sialic acid,
and bisected N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. Although
PHA-E lectin has a strong binding affinity for bisected N-glycans that also contain a terminal galactose on the α1–6-linked
mannose branch, this lectin has lower affinity for N-glycans containing terminal galactose and for agalactosylated bisected
biantennary N-glycans. The lower affinity to these
motifs is observed in the electropherograms as a change in peak width,
which when used in conjunction with the results from the ECL lectin
authenticates the composition of the agalactosylated bisected biantennary N-glycan. For runs performed at 17 °C, the precision
in migration time and peak area was less than or equal to 0.08 and
4% relative standard deviation, respectively. The method is compatible
with electrokinetic and hydrodynamic injections, with detection limits
of 70 and 300 pM, respectively.

==== Body
Glycosylation
is a post-translational
modification that is important for protein stability,1 signaling, and cell–cell communications.2 Thus, N-glycans have significance
as biomarkers for diseases such as cancer.3,4 For
example, bisected N-glycans, which contain an additional N-acetylglucosamine, are a potential biomarker for several
different types of cancers5−7 and other diseases.8−10 Analysis of the N-glycans on IgG is of particular
interest, because antibody glycosylation is associated with the interaction
between antibody and the Fc receptor.11,12 IgG N-glycans vary across species13 and within the human population.14 IgG N-glycans have been reported to contain more than 30 different N-glycan structures in humans.15 Bisected N-glycans have an abundance of 13 to 18%
in IgG from human serum16,17 and are known to increase
the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.18,19 This is relevant to the efficacy of antibody-based biological therapeutics.
Methods of antibody production have been developed to express antibodies
with bisected glycosylation.20 The significance
of bisected glycans has motivated analytical chemists to devise accessible
methods to identify this N-glycan structure and to
quantify the bisected glycosylation present in glycoproteins, such
as IgG.

Lectins, which are proteins with specificity for different
oligosaccharides,
provide inexpensive molecular recognition of N-glycans
in analytical methods.21 When lectins are
immobilized for separations, the chromatographic performance of lectin
affinity columns limits their use to fractionate or enrich complex
samples. Alternatively, arrays can be created, in which lectins are
printed in discrete regions of a chip. Lectin arrays are well-suited
for high-throughput screening of glycoproteins, which contain different
combinations of N-glycans and O-glycans.
Arrays are generally used as a tool to complement other technologies
because of the limitations of lectins. Lectins are subject to cross-reactivity
with other N-glycans and there is a limited set of
glycan structures recognized by lectins. Arrays are commercially available
and have been applied to therapeutic antibodies.22 While arrays may also be applied to complex mixtures, analyses
of mixtures of N-glycans are simpler to interpret
if the sample is fractionated prior to identifying the glycan structure
with the immobilized lectin. This requires the use of an orthogonal
separation mechanism coupled to a platform that integrates a particular
lectin.

Capillary electrophoresis and hydrophilic interaction
liquid chromatography
(HILIC) are both effective separation techniques to profile N-glycans, providing separation times under 30 min and high-throughput
analyses amenable to sialylated N-glycans.23 When coupled to laser-induced fluorescence detection,
both techniques have similar detection limits; however, capillary
electrophoresis is better suited for small sample volumes,23 typically consuming nanoliter volumes of glycan
per run as compared to 1 to 25 μL volumes for HILIC. The use
of 1.2 μL injection volumes in capillary electrophoresis generates
a significantly better detection limit of 360 fM.24 Both HILIC and capillary electrophoresis can incorporate
retention indexing using glucose units (i.e., GU values),25−27 where the elution or migration of each N-glycan
can be compared to a size ladder generating a unique retention index
that can be matched to values in a database to corroborate structural
assignments. The nanogel–lectin method is novel, as it fully
resolves IgG N-glycans and distinguishes IgG N-glycans from contaminant peaks or other interfering peaks.
The nanogel–lectin method may be expanded to lower abundance
IgG N-glycan peaks as well.

Capillary electrophoresis,
which is based on differences in charge-to-size
ratio, is an efficient method for the analysis of N-glycan samples derivatized with charged fluorophores such as 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic
acid (APTS).27 Electrophoretic methods
have incorporated zones of lectins reconstituted in background electrolyte
containing linear polymer.28−30 These reports rely on the mobility
shift of the N-glycan peaks that match the specificity
of the lectin.28−30 Lectin-based separations have not identified bisected N-glycans, because lectin selectivity to bisected N-glycans is limited to the commercially available lectin Phaseolus vulgaris Erythroagglutinin (PHA-E). PHA-E binds
with strong affinity to bisected N-glycans that also
contain a terminal galactose on an α1–6-linked mannose
branch.31 A challenge to using PHA-E to
confirm the presence of bisected N-acetylglucosamine
is that the PHA-E lectin binds with lower affinity to non-bisected N-glycans containing galactose linked to N-acetylglucosamine. In addition, PHA-E lectin binds with lower affinity
to bisected N-acetylglucosamine if the terminal galactose
on the α1–6-linked mannose branch is removed.

A
new approach to lectin-based analyses of the N-glycan
structure is developed, which integrates nanogel to separate N-glycans as well as to pattern proteins that provide a
sequence or structural information in a separation capillary. A nanogel
is a non-Newtonian fluid composed of phospholipids that self-assemble
to form different morphologies with a temperature-dependence. The
nanogel has a low viscosity at low temperature (i.e., 19 °C)
and a gel-like viscosity at temperatures of 25 °C and higher.32,33 Separations of complex samples of N-glycans have
been enhanced with the use of nanogels as a viscous additive in capillary
electrophoresis.34 This temperature-dependent
viscosity can also be harnessed to precisely load different protein-recognition
elements into a capillary.35 Unlike other
high-efficiency chromatographic approaches, when the nanogel separation
is complete, the lectin zone within the capillary can be easily expelled
and replaced with a lectin of different specificity. Furthermore,
nanogel is compatible with proteins, in some cases extending protein
activity.35,36 The integration of nanogel with enzymes
to sequence N-glycans was previously demonstrated.37,38 An enzyme specific for β1–4 galactose was used in combination
with the galactose binding Erythrina cristagalli lectin
(ECL) to confirm linkage specificity.36 While this approach is successful for the determination of galactose,
a barrier to the analysis of bisection is that no commercially available
enzyme with specificity for bisection exists. To address this barrier,
a nanogel electrophoresis separation was developed that resolved bisected
biantennary N-glycans from those that are not bisected.
Furthermore, the method was modified to utilize lectins for structural
identification, including bisection.

The application of capillary
nanogel electrophoresis to identify N-glycans was
adapted to utilize several lectins for structural
identification, including PHA-E, which has a range of binding affinities
to bisected structures. The lower affinity of PHA-E to bisected N-acetylglucosamine that lacks terminal galactose was leveraged
to confirm bisection of agalactosylated N-glycans
in capillary electrophoresis by observing changes in peak broadening.
In addition, the cross-reactivity of PHA-E to non-bisected N-glycans containing galactose linked to N-acetylglucosamine, which confounds the identification of bisected N-glycans, was obviated by comparing the response of these N-glycans to other lectins. Several lectins with structural
specificity were commercially available,27 and this report focused on the use of PHA-E and three other lectins. Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL), ECL, and Sambucus
nigra lectin (SNA) bound to fucose, galactose, and α2–6-linked
sialic acid, respectively. The capillary nanogel electrophoresis method
consumed only nanoliter volumes of lectin per analysis. The separations
were complete in 30 min, and patterning any lectin within the separation
capillary was achieved within 26 min using an automated instrument.

This new lectin electrophoresis method was successfully used to
analyze IgG N-glycans and to verify the structural
identity of peaks that were separated. With traditional capillary
electrophoresis, two of the IgG N-glycans could not
be baseline resolved. However, with the nanogel separation, the major
IgG N-glycans were separated, and baseline resolution
greater than 1.5 was achieved using a 20% preparation at an operating
temperature of 17 °C. A single lectin was introduced as a discrete
zone in the capillary to confirm the identity. This provided confidence
of the N-glycan peak assignments to identify the
structure of the biantennary N-glycans that were
derived from IgG using only four lectins (AAL, ECL, PHA-E, and SNA)
without the use of N-glycan standards or mass spectrometry.
PHA-E lectin was successfully used in an online analysis to detect
all biantennary N-glycans that were bisected with N-acetylglucosamine. With the structural assignment of IgG N-glycans confirmed, the nanogel separation was suitable
to compare N-glycans derived from different sources
of IgG. The ratio of bisected to non-bisected N-glycans
was shown to be significantly different between the two samples. This
method offered a rapid, automated, and inexpensive approach to identify
the structure of the human IgG N-glycans and to distinguish
subtle variations in relative abundances from different batches.

Materials
and Methods
Preparation and Derivatization of Standards
The N-glycans from IgG were cleaved using Rapid PNGase F following
the manufacturer’s two-step protocol.39 The IgG was first weighed and dissolved in deionized water to a
concentration of 6.25 μg/μL of H2O. The cleavage
reaction was performed using the recommended ratio of reagents described
for 100 μg protein samples. Therefore, the reagent volume was
increased in accordance with the use of 600 μg of protein and
6 times the suggested volume (i.e., 96 μL). To isolate the cleaved N-glycans from protein, 360 μL of ice-cold ethanol
was added to the sample and centrifuged for 10 min (10 000
rpm). The supernatant was removed from the precipitate and dried using
a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The
cleaved N-glycans were reconstituted in 2.5 μL
of 30 mM APTS in 20% acetic acid, to which 2.5 μL of 1 M of
sodium cyanoborohydride in tetrahydrofuran was then added. The reaction
was mixed and incubated at 37°C overnight. Maltoheptaose, which
was used to estimate the limit of detection, was labeled using this
procedure with the exception that the ratio of excess APTS was higher
(maltoheptaose/APTS, 1:200). The bisecting N-glycan
standards (10 μg) used to confirm the identity of the bisecting N-glycans in human IgG were labeled with 100 mM APTS in
20% acetic acid, to which 2.5 μL of 1 M sodium cyanoborohydride
in tetrahydrofuran was then added. The reaction was incubated at 37°C
for 2 h. A shorter incubation time was used for the bisected N-glycan, as longer incubation times are only necessary
when high labeling efficiency is desired.40 With the exception of the bisected N-glycan standard,
the incubated reactions were treated to remove excess labeling reagent
using a 1 mL DPA-6S stationary phase extraction tube (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), which is an extraction column composed of polyamide
resin, as described previously.37

Phospholipid
and Lectin Plug Preparation
Phospholipids
were prepared as described previously,37 where the DMPC and DHPC were weighed into the same vial first so
that the final molar ratio is 0.5 or 2.5 for capillary-coating and
-filling, respectively. The mixed solid was dissolved with 50 mM sodium
phosphate so that the mass of nanogel was 5 and 20% for coating and
filling the capillary, respectively. The vial contents were mixed
using a vortex mixer until the solid was dissolved. The nanogel underwent
three freeze–thaw cycles and was centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and was then aliquoted and stored at −20
°C. When placed in the capillary electrophoresis instrument,
the 20% nanogel was stored in the sample storage region which was
set at 4 °C. The 5% nanogel was positioned in the buffer tray.

The commercial lectins AAL, ECL, PHA-E, and SNA were purchased
in powder form from the manufacturer and contained different sugars
and salts as stabilizers. The excess sugars or salts present with
different lectins were removed from the lectins using a 3 kDa (Amicon
Ultra centrifuge filter, Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or a 10 kDa
(Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) molecular
weight cutoff filter. The lectins were dissolved in 100 mM 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid buffered to pH 7 that
also contained 0.1 mM calcium chloride to maintain the lectin activity
during purification. Each lectin (AAL, ECL, PHA-E, and SNA) was then
reconstituted into 30% nanogel 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6) to a
final composition of 20% nanogel.

Capillary Electrophoresis
Online analysis of IgG N-glycans was performed
using a Sciex MDQ Plus (Sciex, Redwood
City, CA) with a laser-induced fluorescence detector (3 mW solid-state
laser, with λex = 488 nm, λem =
520 nm). The instrument was maintained in a temperature controlled
chamber (13 to 17 °C). A 25 μm internal diameter, 360 μm
outer diameter fused silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix,
AZ) was used for the separation. The total length of capillary was
62 cm, and the length to the detection window was 52 cm. Capillaries
were flushed daily with 1 N sodium hydroxide, water, and methanol
as previously reported.37 The capillary
surface was passivated using 5% nanogel ([DMPC]/[DHPC] = 0.5) with
1.25 mM calcium chloride for 20 min at 172 kPa (25 psi) followed by
a forward flush of 50 mM phosphate adjusted to pH 6 using 1 N sodium
hydroxide for 2 min at 172 kPa (25 psi). To easily introduce nanogel
into capillary, the temperature of the capillary cartridge was set
at 19 °C. Before each separation, a 5% nanogel ([DMPC]/[DHPC]
= 0.5) with 1.25 mM calcium chloride was introduced for 10 min at
172 (25 psi) to recoat the surface followed by a rinse with 50 mM
phosphate buffer at pH 6 for 2 min at 172 kPa (25 psi). The capillary
was then filled with 20% phospholipid for 3 min at 172 kPa (25 psi)
and a preplug of background electrolyte for 10 s at 34 kPa (5 psi).
For lectin studies, the fixed lectin zone of 0.5 cm was introduced
at 69 kPa (10 psi) for 7 s after the capillary was filled with 20%
nanogel ([DMPC]/[DHPC] = 2.5) and moved into the capillary first with
nanogel (69 kPa for 28 s) and then with aqueous buffer (34 kPa for
10 s) to create an injection preplug. Two flow injection analyses
were conducted to determine the position of the lectin zone. The capillary
was first filled with 20% nanogel followed by APTS, which was detectable
using laser-induced fluorescence. The APTS was then pushed to the
detection window either with nanogel at 69 kPa or with aqueous buffer
at 34 kPa. The mobilization velocities of the APTS when pushed with
nanogel at 69 kPa and with aqueous buffer at 34 kPa were 0.066 and
0.045 cm/s, respectively. At these velocities (i.e., 0.066 cm/s for
28 s and 0.045 cm/s for 10 s), the position of the lectin zone was
estimated to be 2.3 cm.

Following the introduction of lectin,
the instrument was programmed to perform two wait steps that dipped
the capillary in 20% nanogel and then in an aqueous buffer to reduce
the residual lectin on the outer surface of the separation capillary.
After the capillary was filled and patterned with nanogel, the temperature
of the capillary cartridge was decreased to 17 °C for sample
injection and separation. The sample was either injected with voltage
(10 kV for 4 s) or pressure (21 kPa for 5 s), as noted in the figure
captions. The sample was prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6)
for electrokinetic injection to maintain reproducible peak areas following
multiple injections. The sample was reconsittued in water for hydrodynamic
injection to enable sample recovery if warranted. The injections were
followed by the introduction of an aqueous 50 mM phosphate post plug,
of 3.4 kPa (0.5 psi) for 5 s. For electrokinetic and hydrodynamic
injections, detection limits of 70 and 300 pM, respectively, were
obtained using maltoheptaose labeled with excess APTS. After the run
was complete, a 172 kPa (25 psi) background electrolyte flush for
10 min was applied in the reverse direction to push out any remaining
protein toward the site of injection. Separations of N-glycans were performed in the absence of lectin to demonstrate that
the flushing protocol was sufficient to prevent carryover by the lectin
(Figure S-1). Data collection and analyses
were performed using 32 Karat Software version 10.2 (MDQ Plus). For
runs obtained with electrokinetic or hydrodynamic injections, the
integration parameters used to obtain area were a width of 0.5, shoulder
sensitivity of 250, and threshold of 250.

Results and Discussion
Lectins were integrated with capillary nanogel electrophoresis
for N-glycan identification as demonstrated conceptually
in Figure 1. The capillary
was loaded with nanogel to improve the electrophoresis separation.
Lectins have structural or monomer selectivity. A stationary plug
of lectin was introduced in the capillary as shown in Figure 1. When the structural specificity
was a match, the N-glycan was bound to the lectin
and removed from the electropherogram. The nanogel, which was compatible
with the lectin, was made with an aqueous solution that was buffered
to a pH of 6. This pH was selected based on the isoelectric points
of most lectins, with SNA at pI = 5,41 ECL
at pI = 5.0–5.6,42 PHA-E at pI =
5.25 to 6.5,43,44 and AAL at pI = 9.45 The performance of other background electrolytes
buffered at other pH values was not evaluated. Separations in the
phospholipid nanogel were performed in reversed polarity, because
a nanogel coating was used to suppress the electro-osmotic flow.46,47 After the capillary was filled with phospholipid, a 0.5 cm zone
of lectin made in phospholipid nanogel was created and moved approximately
2.3 cm into the capillary. With the commercial instrument used in
this work, this positioned the lectin zone near the thermostated region
of the separation capillary. Longer zones of lectin could be used
with the capillary but were unnecessary. It is possible to retard N-glycans by filling the capillary with lectin rather than
concentrating the lectin in a zone (see Figure S-2, traces B and C). However, drawbacks of filling the entire
capillary with lectin include the additional flushing required to
prevent carryover and the potential for lectin to aggregate or foul
the capillary surface at higher concentrations.

Figure 1 Conceptual diagram illustrating
the use of lectins with capillary
electrophoresis to identify N-glycan structure. The N-glycan peak appeared in the electropherogram when the
capillary contained nanogel (A), but when bound to the lectin, the
peak was absent from the trace (B).

Effect of Percent Phospholipid on N-Glycan
Separations
The use of nanogel as an additive for capillary
electrophoresis had previously been demonstrated with 10% phospholipid
solution with [DMPC]/[DHPC] = 2.5 in background electrolyte for the
separation of N-glycans derived from alpha-1-acid
glycoprotein, fetuin, and RNase B.34 The N-glycans all possessed the same core structure.48 Human IgG N-glycans were predominantly
reported to be biantennary and fucosylated15,49 and contained varying levels of α2–6-linked sialic
acid, galactose, and bisected N-acetylglucosamine,49 with the most prominent N-glycan
structures summarized in Figure 2. The N-glycans were from a well-characterized
commercially available human IgG standard50 and separated with 10% nanogel. As documented in the certificate
of analysis,50 the IgG standard contained
three bisected N-glycans (peaks 4, 7, 9), but one
of these bisected N-glycans (peak 7) comigrated with
another N-glycan (see Figure 3, upper trace). The comigration of peaks
6 and 7 in capillary electrophoresis separations had been reported
by others as well.26,51

Figure 2 IgG is glycosylated in the Fc region and
possibly in different
locations within the Fab region (A). The N-glycans
in human IgG are predominantly fucosylated with varying degrees of
galactose, α2–6-linked sialic acid, and bisected N-acetylglucosamine (B). Fucose, terminal galactose, α2–6-linked
sialic acid, and bisected N-acetylglucosamine are
recognized by AAL, ECL, SNA, and PHA-E lectin, respectively (C).

Figure 3 Electropherograms of IgG N-glycans
obtained with
nanogel at 10% (A), 15% (B), and 20% (C). Separations were obtained
using a 25 μm inner diameter capillary at 17 °C with an
effective length of 52 cm and a total length of 62 cm. The electric
field was 387 V/cm in reversed polarity. Sample was injected at 10
kV for 4 s.

The separation enhancement
achievable using higher concentrations
of nanogel for capillary electrophoresis separations was demonstrated
for linear oligosaccharides32 but not for N-glycans. As a result, the effect of nanogel concentration
on the resolution of these comigrating peaks was investigated at three
nanogel concentrations (10, 15, and 20%). The effect of separation
performance was also evaluated for each concentration at a temperature
known to generate low viscosity (17 °C) and high viscosity (27
°C). The results, summarized in Table S-1, demonstrated that the resolution between peaks 6 and 7 improved
with an increase in nanogel concentration, whereas the resolution
of peaks 5 and 6 did not change significantly at nanogel concentrations
above 10%. In addition, baseline resolution (i.e., resolution above
1.5) was only achieved using 20% nanogel at 17 °C for all N-glycan peaks in the IgG sample. This temperature-dependence
of the nanogel peak resolution warranted additional experiments to
confirm that 17 °C was the best temperature for the capillary
nanogel separation of IgG N-glycans.

In agreement
with results reported by others,26,52,53 decreasing the separation temperature increased
the migration time of all of the N-glycan peaks (see Table S-2). A plot of the mobility versus temperature
(Figure S-3) revealed nominal change in
mobility below 23 °C. At this temperature, nanodiscs were reported
as the predominant morphology produced in mixtures of DMPC and DHPC
phospholipids.54−56 For the separations accomplished using 20% nanogel,
the temperature did not influence the resolution of structural isomers
(peaks 5 and 6), but maintaining the separation at 17 °C improved
the resolution of the non-bisected (peak 6) and bisected N-glycan (peak 7) that comigrated under other conditions (see Figure 3 and Table S-3). These separations demonstrated that
bisected and non-bisected N-glycans behaved as two
different homologous series, as the hydrodynamic volume and molecular
weight were well-correlated (see Figure S-4 and Table S-4), which was previously
attributed to the more compact nature of bisected N-glycans as compared to non-bisected N-glycans.57 The best peak resolution was observed at 17
°C, and the temperature did not affect the migration time reproducibility
(≤0.08% relative standard deviation), peak area reproducibility
(≤4% relative standard deviation), or separation efficiency
nor did it result in comigration of the other peaks in the sample
(see Table S-5 and Figure S-5). Therefore, the separations were performed using
20% nanogel at a temperature of 17 °C.

Integration of a Lectin
Zone In-Capillary for N-Glycan Characterization
Lectin specificity for different
structural features of N-glycans was utilized to
confirm the identity of each peak in the electropherogram. The lectin
was integrated into the capillary as outlined in Figure 1, and N-glycan
structures were revealed by comparing the separations obtained in
the absence and the presence of one of four different lectins. When
the lectin specificity matches the N-glycan, the
peak disappears from the electropherogram, identifying the N-glycan structure. Complex N-glycans have
a predictable structure (see Figure 2) with a mannose core at the reducing end.48 For IgG N-glycans, if fucose
is present, it will be at the core49 and
if sialic acid is present, it will be a terminal residue, and it will
be α2–6-linked to a galactose residue.58 The nonreducing ends of the mannose cores of the IgG N-glycans contained variable amounts of N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and α2–6-linked sialic
acids and bisected N-acetylglucosamine. As a result,
peak identification was achieved using only four lectins based on
the known N-glycan structure. This lectin analysis
was accomplished by identifying the presence of fucose on the mannose
core with AAL, followed by galactose, α2–6-linked sialic
acid, and bisection on the nonreducing end of the N-glycan with ECL, SNA, and PHA-E, respectively. In these studies,
it was not necessary to use the Maackia Amurensis lectin with specificity for α2–3-linked sialic acid,
as this linkage is not reported to be present in human IgG.58 The amount of each lectin required was determined
by increasing the concentration of lectin in the nanogel zone until
no change was observed in the peak area and there was no evidence
of retarded N-glycan within the retention window
of the major IgG N-glycan peaks (see Figures S-6–9). For runs performed at
17 °C, the relative standard deviation in the area in the absence
and in the presence of lectin was at or below 4 and 8%, respectively
(see Table S-6).

The stepwise analysis
of N-glycans with lectins was accomplished as demonstrated
in Figure 4. All peaks
separated by the capillary electrophoresis in Figure 4A disappeared with the use of fucose specific
lectin (AAL) in Figure 4B, confirming that all of the IgG N-glycans contained
fucose. In Figure 4C, galactose specific lectin ECL removed peaks 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and
9 from the electropherogram, confirming they were galactosylated N-glycans that contained one or two galactose residues.
In contrast, peaks 1, 3, and 4 in Figure 4C indicated the absence of terminal galactose
and contained either a terminal α2–6-linked sialic acid
(peak 1) or terminal N-acetylglucosamine (peaks 3
and 4). In Figure 4D, a lectin specific for sialic acid containing an α2–6
linkage (SNA) removed two N-glycans, confirming that
only peaks 1 and 2 contained a terminal α2–6-linked sialic
acid. The number of α2–6-linked sialic acid residues
present in the biantennary structure of peaks 1 and 2 was elucidated
by considering the combined findings from the electropherograms in Figures 4C and D. Because
peak 2 was recognized by both ECL and SNA, this peak was attributed
to an N-glycan structure containing galactose and
α2–6-linked sialic acid at each terminus. Peak 1, which
responded to SNA but not ECL, was attributed to an α2–6-linked
sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine at each terminus.
Fully sialylated biantennary N-glycan was ruled out
because of the migration time and the low abundance of the glycoform
in human IgG. In a similar manner, peaks 3 and 4 were identified as N-glycans with N-acetylglucosamine at both
termini by considering the combined results from the electropherograms
obtained in the presence of galactose specific lectin ECL (Figures 4C) and α2–6-linked
sialic acid specific lectin (Figure 4D).

Figure 4 Electropherograms of IgG glycans were obtained in the
absence of
lectin (A) or with 100 μM AAL selective for fucose (B), 200
μM ECL selective for galactose (C), 3 μM SNA selective
for 2–6-linked sialic acid (D), or 5 μM PHA-E predominantly
selective for bisected glycan but with lower affinity to terminal
Galβ1–4GlcNAc on α1–6-linked mannose branch
(E). Separation conditions were as described in Figure 3.

Confirmation of Bisected N-Glycan Assignments
Based on PHA-E
In Figure 4E, the PHA-E lectin specific for bisected N-glycan that also contained a terminal galactose on the α1–6-linked
mannose branch31 removed peaks 7 and 9,
confirming that these N-glycans were bisected. As
shown in Figure 4,
the PHA-E lectin had a lower affinity for N-glycans
containing terminal galactose (i.e., peaks 2, 5, 6, and 8) and for
agalactosylated bisected biantennary N-glycan (peak
4). These peaks had a nominal decrease in peak area (i.e., ≤
10%) but had wider peak widths and greater than a 10% decrease in
the theoretical plate count (see Table S-7 in the Supporting Information). This observed band broadening was
used in conjunction with the results of the galactose-selective ECL
lectin separation in Figure 4C to confirm that peak 4 was the agalactosylated bisected
biantennary N-glycan. To demonstrate the selectivity
of PHA-E lectin, two bisected N-glycan standards
were separated in the presence of this lectin and verified the interactions
observed for the IgG N-glycans in Figure 4. The agalactosylated bisected N-glycan standard corresponding to peak 4 was observed to
decrease in plate count but remained in the electropherogram, whereas
the bigalactosylated bisected N-glycan standard corresponding
to peak 9 was removed from the electropherogram (see Figure S-10).

Identification of N-Glycans
of Minor Abundance
A total of nine abundant N-glycans (i.e., peaks
1–9) are identified with four lectins; yet other small peaks
are observed in the electropherogram. Some residual peaks in the electropherogram
are contaminants; however, six additional minor peaks are identified
as N-glycans as well (Figure S-11 and Table S-8). These six N-glycans constitute approximately 4% of the sum of the
areas associated with N-glycans attributed to peaks
1 through 9. A seventh peak can be identified if Griffonia
simplicifolia lectin II is used, which is a lectin specific
for β-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues (Figure S-12). The integration of lectin and capillary
nanogel electrophoresis provides a means to distinguish contaminant
peaks that may be confused for N-glycans, offering
an additional means of structural identification.

Profiling IgG N-Glycans from Different IgG
Samples
Following the identification of the major IgG N-glycans using online lectin analyses (i.e., peaks 1 through
9), capillary nanogel electrophoresis provided a quantitative comparison
between two different IgG samples. The N-glycans
from different IgG samples were introduced in the separation capillary
with a hydrodynamic injection to prevent preferential injection observed
with electrokinetic injections arising from differences in the sample
matrix. No difference in migration time of the N-glycan
peaks was observed between electrokinetic and hydrodynamic injections.
The relative abundance of each N-glycan in these
different samples was compared by normalizing the samples to the signal
for the agalactosylated bisected N-glycan (i.e.,
peak 4). This was accomplished by adjusting the concentration of each
sample to the same peak area for the agalactosylated bisected N-glycan (peak 4). The solid trace in Figure 5 was the same IgG sample shown in Figures 3 and 4, whereas the dotted trace contained N-glycans
derived from the new IgG sample. Notably, all of the major N-glycans were fucosylated. The peak areas of the bisected N-glycans (peaks 4 and 7) were not significantly different
(see Table 1). The
total amount of bisected N-glycan in samples 1 and
2 was 9.1 and 7.5%, respectively (see the electropherograms in Figure S-13 and Table S-9). Conversely, most of the peak areas of the non-bisected N-glycans, except for peak 3, were significantly different,
with sample 1 containing higher amounts of these non-bisected N-glycans than sample 2 (see Table 1 and Figure 5). The percentages of non-bisected N-glycans that contained α2–6-linked sialic acid (peaks
1 and 2) relative to the total N-glycan composition
were only 6.3 and 10.4% in samples 1 and 2, respectively. The peak
areas of the non-bisected N-glycans that lacked α2–6-linked
sialic acid (peaks 3, 5, 6, and 8) comprised over 80% of the total N-glycan composition for both samples. The distributions
of biantennary N-glycans (see Table S-9) containing 0 (G0F), 1 (G1F), or 2 (G2F) terminal
galactose residues for samples 1 and 2 were similar to 27 and 24%
G0F, 39 and 38% G1F, and 19 and 19% G2F, respectively.

Figure 5 Overlaid electropherograms
to profile IgG N-glycans.
The solid trace is of the sample depicted in Figures 3 and 4, and the dotted
trace is of N-glycans derived from a different source
of IgG. The concentration of the samples was adjusted to make peak
4 the same area in order to compare relative abundance. Separation
conditions were as described in Figure 3, with the exception of sample injection at 3 psi for
5 s.

The commercial standards selected
for this study were useful to
demonstrate the power of the method to evaluate the N-glycan profile but were intended for use as a chemical standard
rather than a clinical standard. Although the effectiveness of capillary
electrophoresis for profiling N-glycans was demonstrated
in Figure 5 and Table 1, several factors
made it difficult to draw global conclusions from these results based
on published literature values of IgG N-glycan heterogeneity.
Glycosylation levels vary considerably in humans.14,59 In addition, analytical studies designed to profile IgG N-glycans were confounded by differences in the distributions
of N-glycans at the Fab and Fc regions of the antibody,60,61 which required enzymatic treatment designed to cleave the Fab and
Fc regions of the IgG antibody62 or treatment
with PNGase F performed without denaturing the protein.60,61 With these caveats, it was noted that the relative abundance of
bisecting N-acetylglucosamine was similar to some
reports in the literature.16,63 Furthermore, the abundance
of the non-bisected galactosylated N-glycans was
similar to a report that approximated the amount of N-glycans containing zero (G0F), one (G1F), or two (G2F) terminal
galactose residues derived from commercially available human IgG at
25, 33, and 15%, respectively.63 The same
authors reported the amount of N-glycans containing
zero (G0F), one (G1F), or two (G2F) terminal galactose residues from
IgG derived from healthy humans at 21, 38, and 16%, respectively.63 There was a notable difference in the relative
abundance of sialylated N-glycans (i.e., 6.3 and
10.4% for samples 1 and 2, respectively) from both samples as compared
to literature values of 12 to 25% reported by others.16,23,63,64 In this study, no effort was made to prevent loss of sialic acid
during the deglycosylation step, in which protein used to derive sample
2 N-glycans was denatured at 80 °C for 2 min.
Hydrolysis of sialic acids, for example at elevated temperatures,
would decrease the amount of sialylated N-glycan
observed and increase the asialylated N-glycans (i.e.,
peaks 5, 6, and 8). The results in the literature point to the need
for a low-cost, automated, and accessible method to profile IgG N-glycans and the potential of the capillary electrophoresis
as enabling technology to complement other approaches for N-glycan identification.

Conclusions and Future
Directions
The applicability of nanogel electrophoresis to N-glycan analysis was expanded to include the use of lectins
to identify N-glycan composition without the need
for N-glycan standards. In conjunction with a series
of four lectins (AAL,
ECL, SNA, and PHA-E), biantennary N-glycans derived
from human IgG protein were identified. The conclusive detection of
all bisected N-glycans was not been previously demonstrated
with PHA-E. The lower affinity of the PHA-E lectin for N-glycan that contained terminal galactose in the absence of bisected N-acetylglucosamine as well as for N-glycans
that were agalactosylated bisected biantennary was leveraged when
lectins were integrated in capillary electrophoresis, because the
lower affinity to these motifs was observed in the electropherograms
as a change in the peak width. This change in width, when used in
conjunction with the results obtained with the ECL lectin, enabled
the assignment of the agalactosylated bisected biantennary N-glycan. The profiles from two different IgG samples revealed
significant differences in the amount of non-bisected N-glycans, except for peak 3. When the two samples were normalized
to the concentration of the agalactosylated bisected biantennary N-glycan, no significant difference in the distribution
of bisected N-glycans was observed. Analyses of N-glycans were achieved with separation efficiencies of
approximately 500 000 theoretical plates using 20% w/v nanogel.
Although the change in temperature did not impact efficiency, it enabled
the resolution of monogalactosylated biantennary N-glycan from bisected monogalactosylated biantennary N-glycan. This role of temperature in resolving bisected and non-bisected N-glycans had previously been observed only with linear
polymers used as a separation additive but has now been demonstrated
in self-assembled nanogels.

The nanogel electrophoresis separations
that incorporate lectins
are rapid, automated, and cost-effective. This method holds potential
to rapidly screen IgG samples for the degree of bisected N-glycan, which is relevant to the therapeutic efficacy of IgG monoclonal
antibody pharmaceuticals. In addition, the method is significant to
the rapid identification of bisection in IgG from human serum and
complements existing technologies used to shed light on the prognostic
and diagnostic relevance of this motif.
