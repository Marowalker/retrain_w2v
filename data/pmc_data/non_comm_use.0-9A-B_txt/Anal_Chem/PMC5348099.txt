A simplified coupling
of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immuno-biosensing
with ambient ionization mass spectrometry (MS) was developed. It combines
two orthogonal analysis techniques: the biosensing capability of SPR
and the chemical identification power of high resolution MS. As a
proof-of-principle, deoxynivalenol (DON), an important mycotoxin,
was captured using an SPR gold chip containing an antifouling layer
and monoclonal antibodies against the toxin and, after washing, the
chip could be taken out and analyzed by direct spray MS of the biosensor
chip to confirm the identity of DON. Furthermore, cross-reacting conjugates
of DON present in a naturally contaminated beer could be successfully
identified, thus showing the potential of rapid identification of
(un)expected cross-reacting molecules.

==== Body
Surface plasmon
resonance (SPR)
is a powerful biosensing tool for the real-time detection of a wide
range of molecules. Apart from that, SPR provides important information
about the binding kinetics of a biorecognition event. However, SPR
does not provide the chemical identity of the binding analyte.1 Monoclonal antibodies are used in SPR for the
selective immuno-capturing and detection of the analyte. Although
antibodies are highly specific, conjugates of the analyte can sometimes
cross-react with the antibodies. Such cross-reacting conjugates cannot
be distinguished from the targeted analyte by SPR and may lead to
overestimation of the analyte concentration. Therefore, coupling of
SPR with mass spectrometry (MS) would not only confirm the identity
of the SPR-detected target analyte(s) but also might help to find
any (un)expected cross-reacting analytes.2 As the bioreagents used for SPR are not MS-compatible, initial elution-based
SPR-MS methods involved online collection of the desorbed analyte
on a precolumn, followed by sample cleanup and off-line transfer of
the precolumn with the sample to an electrospray ionization (ESI)
tandem MS system.3 This leads to sample
losses, which complicates the MS identification due to the minute
amounts present. More sophisticated elution-based SPR-MS couplings
allow real online MS analysis of analytes; however, the interfacing
can be rather complex and expensive.4−6 Alternatively, coupling
of SPR and MS based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
(MALDI) allows direct analysis of the biosensor chip7,8 but requires the addition of an excess of MALDI matrix. The abundant
matrix (cluster) ions can easily obscure the ions of small molecules
(<700 Da) present at subnanogram levels; hence, most of the SPR-MALDI
MS studies focus on the identification of peptides and proteins.

Ambient ionization methods for mass spectrometry, such as direct
analysis in real time (DART)9 and desorption
electrospray ionization (DESI),10,11 have gained significant
attention in the past decade as analyses can be performed at room
temperature, under atmospheric conditions, often require minimal sample
preparation, and are suitable for small molecules.12 Ionization methods based on direct spray,13 where the sample is loaded onto a solid substrate (paper,
metal, wood, glass, etc.)14−16 followed by application of a
high voltage (HV) to generate ions, have become popular due to their
simplicity. These methods rely on extraction/desorption of the analytes
from the surface of the substrate using an organic solvent and, consequently,
the overall selectivity is entirely dependent on the resolution of
the mass analyzer. Recently, in an attempt to get rid of interfering
components, coated blade spray was demonstrated in which solid-phase
micro extraction (SPME) was coupled with a desorption electrospray
ionization (DESI) source.17 As the analyte
of interest was captured by the SPME coating, the method offered both
sample enrichment and removal of other components using a washing
step prior to MS analysis.

The aim of the present paper was
the development of a simplified
SPR-MS coupling. An SPR biochip coated with antibodies was used to
selectively capture the analyte in an SPR apparatus. The SPR chip
was taken out, and following the application of a solvent and a high
voltage, the analytes were desorbed and directly sprayed into a high-resolution
MS (HRMS). In contrast to other direct MS approaches using affinity
surfaces, such as, for example, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization
(SELDI)18 and self-assembled monolayers
laser desorption/ionization (SAMDI),19,20 the proposed
concept combines two orthogonal analysis techniques. Moreover, the
analysis of low molecular weight compounds was not obstructed by MALDI
matrix ions.

Experimental Section
Carboxymethylated
dextran (CMD) coated flat gold chips were purchased
from Xantec (Düsseldorf, Germany). Nanostructured gold chips
were purchased from Plasmore Srl. (Ispra, Italy) and were further
modified with CMD by Xantec. SPR measurements on flat gold chips were
performed using a Biacore 3000, and iSPR measurements on nanostructured
gold chips were obtained using a prototype portable imaging nanoplasmonics
instrument (Plasmore Srl., Italy).21,22 Ethanolamine
hydrochloride, 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC), and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Methanol was purchased
from VWR (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M HEPES,
pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20) was purchased
from GE Healthcare (Diegem, Belgium). Milli-Q water (18.3 MΩ·cm
resistivity) was obtained using a Merck (Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
water purification system.

The immobilization of antibodies
on the CMD-modified gold chips
for SPR was performed manually on the bench: the entire chip was activated
using 50 μL of a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 M NHS and 0.4 M EDC for
30 min, followed by washing with water and drying with nitrogen. Next,
50 μL of antibody solution (50 μg/mL in 10 mM acetate
buffer, pH 4.5) was added to the activated chip. The chip was kept
in an airtight container for 2 h to avoid evaporation and drying out
of the solution. Following the incubation, the chips were washed with
water and dried with nitrogen. Unreacted groups were blocked with
ethanolamine for 30 min. Then, the chips were rinsed with Milli-Q
water and dried with nitrogen. The chips were stored at 4–8
°C until use. The CMD chips (with or without antibodies) were
mounted on the SPR flow cell and flushed with HBS-EP buffer for 5
min to allow swelling of the hydrogel. This was followed by injection
of 50 μL of sample (blank or spiked buffer or beer). The chip
was then flushed with HBS-EP (5 min) followed by water (5 min). Finally,
the chip was unmounted from the SPR flow cell, dried with nitrogen,
and mounted in the Biochip Spray MS setup.

The chip was clamped
by an alligator clip, which was part of a
modified DESI ion source (Prosolia, USA) equipped with a rotational
and x–y–z positioner, and was directly connected to the HV supply of the ion
source (Figure 1A).
The square chip was positioned at an angle (2–4°) with
one of the corners pointing downward toward the MS inlet and at a
distance of 4–6 mm (Figure 1B). Five μL of spray solvent was added using
an Eppendorf pipet (0.5–10 μL). After a waiting time
of 30 s, a voltage of 5 kV was applied. All MS analyses were performed
with a model Q-Exactive Focus quadrupole orbitrap high resolution
MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to obtain full-scan positive ion measurements
with a scan range of m/z 150.0–1000.0,
a mass resolution of 70 000, a maximum injection time of 100
ms, and a scan rate of 1 Hz. The capillary temperature was 250 °C,
and the S-lens RF level was 50. CAUTION: High voltages are
involved! Prior to adding the spray solvent, always check that the
voltage is actually 0 V and only switch it on when nobody is near
the tip. The setup should not be touched during the experiment. Thermo Scientific Xcalibur software was used for data acquisition
and processing. The intensity of the ions with m/z values within ±5 ppm of the theoretical m/z is shown in the extracted ion chronogram (EIC).

Results and Discussion
Although any analyte–antibody
pair could have been selected
to show the concept, this study uses a low molecular weight mycotoxin,
deoxynivalenol (DON), and a corresponding monoclonal antibody (anti-DON),
due to its societal relevance. Deoxynivalenol is a secondary metabolite
of fungi and is commonly found in several foods such as nuts, cereals,
coffee, oil seeds, and fruits, as well as in beverages and animal
feed.23−25 Due to the thermal stability and relatively good
water solubility, DON can be carried over from a contaminated starting
ingredient like barley to malt and finally into beer.26,27 First, to demonstrate the feasibility of direct spray from a gold
surface for analysis of DON, 5 μL of 1 μg/mL (5000 pg)
DON was placed in one corner of a CMD-modified gold biosensor chip
(without any biorecognition) after which the solvent was allowed to
evaporate. Then, 10 μL of methanol was placed on the same corner
of the chip followed by application of a high voltage to generate
the spray. The voltage and distance between the chip and the MS inlet
were optimized in order to obtain a stable spray without electric
discharge. Optimal settings were 5 kV at a distance of 4–6
mm between the chip and the MS. Although shorter distances than 4
mm required a lower voltage for spraying, electric discharge was occasionally
seen whereas larger distances (>6 mm) in combination with higher
voltages
led to either an unstable spray or no spray at all. Furthermore, the
angle was adjusted such that the added methanol neither spread over
the chip nor started to drip off from the chip but rather remained
at one corner. Under these optimized conditions, a stable spray for
about 10–20 s was generated. Ions for [DON + H]+ (m/z 297.1326), [DON + NH4]+ (m/z 314.1588),
[DON + Na]+ (m/z 319.1150),
and [DON + K]+ (m/z 335.0882)
were observed in positive ion mode (see Figure S1A). Although the [DON + Na]+ ion showed the highest
intensity, [DON + H]+ was chosen for identification as
an unknown positive ion with m/z 319.1150 (Figure S1B) was also seen in
blank measurements (methanol spraying solvent only). As the unidentified
interferent ion had, within experimental mass accuracy error, the
same exact mass as [DON + Na]+, using a higher resolution
mass analyzer was not an option to resolve the [DON + Na]+ and the interfering agent ions. Measurements were performed in negative
ion mode as well, but positive ionization was chosen because the intensities
of the ions were at least an order of magnitude higher. When four
corners of the 1 × 1 cm chips were subsequently used, quite reproducible
average signal intensities (total area of the signal (in arbitrary
units) divided by the time of signal duration (in min)) of 8.1 ×
107, 2.7 × 108, 1.5 × 108, and 1.1 × 108, respectively, were obtained (Figure 1C). The comparable
results obtained for the four different corners suggest that a single
chip can be analyzed four times, for example, serving the purpose
of replicate analyses or even multiplexing by immobilizing four different
biorecognition elements in each corner of the square chip. No physical
damage (scratching) was observed on the side used earlier for clamping
as the CMD modified chips are quite scratch-resistant. Next, serial
dilutions of DON were analyzed (5000, 500, 50, and 5 pg), yielding
a decrease of an order of magnitude of average signal intensities
at each dilution step (108 for 5000 pg, 107 for
500 pg, and 106 for 50 pg). No signal for DON could be
observed when only 5 pg of the toxin was spiked onto the chip. Washing
of the CMD gold chip (after spiking with DON and drying) with HBS-EP
and water was performed to check if any DON could be nonspecifically
adsorbed to the chip surface without antibodies. Even when spiked
at the highest level (5000 pg), no ions for DON were observed following
washing.

For the Biochip Spray measurements, anti-DON was covalently
immobilized
on gold chips coated with carboxymethylated dextran. This was followed
by introduction of buffer or beer containing the toxins (10 μg/mL
DON) and washing of the chips (HBSEP followed by water), both performed
in the SPR instrument. Washing of the chip with buffer (HBS-EP) helped
to get rid of any nonspecifically adsorbed mycotoxin or sample components
while the washing with water removed buffer salts, making the chip
suitable for direct spray MS experiments. The chip was then unmounted
from the SPR flow cell, dried with nitrogen, and subsequently positioned
in front of the MS inlet capillary. The choice of solvent is an additional
parameter as it must not only be efficient for creating a stable electrospray
but also should be able to disrupt the interaction of antibodies (anti-DON)
with the mycotoxins (DON). Like in direct spray, 100% methanol gave
a reproducible and stable spray. Using a lower concentration of methanol
(90% methanol; 10% water) was not feasible as it often required higher
voltages (>6 kV), and the spray was not reproducible. In earlier
SPR
studies, acidic (10 mM HCl) and basic conditions (20 mM NaOH) were
found to be suitable for disrupting the interaction of antibody and
antigen.28,29 However, these SPR chip regenerants are
not compatible with MS experiments and must be replaced with, for
example, formic acid or ammonium hydroxide. Thus, the addition of
1–2% formic acid or ammonium hydroxide to methanol was tested
as well, but the best disruption and direct spray performance was
still obtained with 100% methanol. As can be seen from Figure 2A,B, ions for DON could be
observed in both spiked buffer and spiked beer. In the Biochip Spray
experiment, 10 μg/mL toxins was used to ensure saturation of
the available binding sites of the antibodies on the surface as observed
in the calibration curves from the SPR experiments (Figure S2B). However, only a limited amount can be captured
and thus be later detected by Biochip Spray MS. When comparing the
obtained average signal intensity (106) with the spiked
solution experiments described above, approximately ∼50 pg
of DON, i.e., in the range expected on the basis of the amount of
anti-DON present according to SPR, was immuno-captured and subsequently
analyzed by Biochip Spray MS. To ensure that desorption was complete,
the chip after having been used for the Biochip Spray MS experiment
(no signals were observed in the second spray) was placed in a methanol
solution (200 μL) for 5 min with occasional shaking. The resulting
extract was evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 5 μL of methanol,
and analyzed by ESI-MS. The absence of any ions from DON confirmed
the complete desorption. Another parameter that has been suggested
for optimization in the literature is the waiting time before starting
the spray.17 Therefore, 0, 30, and 60 s
of waiting time were tested to see if there was any effect on the
amount of analyte desorbed. Insignificant differences were observed
between the different waiting times, so 30 s of waiting time was chosen
to ensure sufficient and controlled timing between adding the methanol
solution and applying the voltage. To confirm the selectivity of the
developed method, two negative control experiments were performed.
The first negative control was a chip containing anti-DON but incubated
in blank beer: the absence of DON ions was confirmed by Biochip Spray
MS. Another control experiment was performed by immobilizing an antibody
against another mycotoxin, fumonisin (anti-FB1), elsewhere
on the same chip. On the basis of previous research,28 anti-FB1 does not cross-react with DON. After
introduction of beer spiked with DON and the standard washing procedure,
high voltage was applied to the chip. A change indicating the onset
of the spray was seen in the total ion chronogram (Figure S3A), but no ions for DON were observed (zero signal
in the extracted ion chronogram, Figure S3B). The above-mentioned experiments serve as true negative controls
for two reasons. First, they could be performed on another corner
of the same chip, the first half of which was used for immobilization
of anti-DON. Second, the anti-FB1 used is also an IgG and
would account for any nonspecific adsorption that could occur during
the experiment. Reuse of the SPR sensor chip is still a big challenge
in SPR-MS as the conditions used for desorption and ionization involve
organic solvents that not only disrupt the antibody–antigen
interaction but also unfold the immobilized antibodies.7 Indeed, we observed similar problems: the chips
coated with antibodies could only be used for SPR biosensing once.
Upon reincubation of the same chip in a solution containing the analyte,
no DON signal could be obtained. However, the proposed four corner
approach for replicate analysis, multiplexing, or negative control
experiments offers a reasonable compromise between reliable results
and economy of use.

Figure 2 Extracted ion chronogram for m/z 297.1333 ([DON + H]+) recorded in positive
mode obtained
from a CMD-modified gold chip with immobilized anti-DON, flushed in
the iSPR flow cell with (A) spiked buffer containing 10 μg/mL
DON and (B) spiked beer containing 10 μg/mL DON, followed by
washing with buffer and water and transfer to the Biochip Spray MS
setup.

Finally, to demonstrate the real-life
application of the newly
developed method, a naturally contaminated beer sample containing
2760 ± 95 ng/mL DON plus 3883 ± 137 ng/mL deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside
(D3G) according to LC-MS/MS30 or 5290 ±
370 ng/mL according to SPR (DON plus conjugates) was used.29 Large molecular weight analytes, such as proteins,
yield high signals in SPR sensing with an antibody biochip and may
be analyzed in a direct SPR assay (Figures S2A and S4A) without signal enhancer. Subsequently, the binding
molecules may be identified in a direct manner by MS using MALDI7,8 or following elution3 using ESI MS or
potentially by Biochip Spray MS (Figure S4A). However, low molecular weight analytes, such as DON, are much
more challenging to detect in label-free biosensing approaches such
as SPR: in a direct SPR mode with an antibody biochip, a low and noisy
signal (Figure S2A, solid line, Biacore)
or no signal (iSPR) will be obtained, unless the assay is changed
into a competition format using a signal enhancer such as DON-OVA
(Figure S2A, dashed line). Moreover, direct
MS identification of low-molecular weight binding molecules would
be challenging as well due to, e.g., matrix interference in MALDI
MS and ion suppression and interference from residual assay reagents
in ESI MS. Therefore, we performed SPR biosensing of DON in the contaminated
beer sample in two different modes: (i) a competitive direct mode,
using an anti-DON biochip and the addition of DON-OVA to the beer
sample as a signal enhancer (Figures S2B and S4B) and (ii) a competitive indirect mode using an immobilized DON biochip
and the beer sample mixed with anti-DON (Figures S2D and S4C). In both SPR modes, almost full signal inhibition
was observed due to the presence of DON and conjugates in the contaminated
beer (Figure S2C,E). Please note that,
as for any large-scale routine SPR analysis of small molecules, a
competitive indirect mode using an immobilized DON biochip (Figures S2D and S4C) would be the method of choice
since such a chip will show extreme durability and, in the present
case, could be used more than 400 times.29 Obviously, an immobilized DON chip would not directly trap the low
molecular weight ligands for subsequent chemical identification by
MS. As a way out, a so-called “recovery-chip” approach
was applied as demonstrated previously for the coupling of inhibition
SPR with nanoLC MS.4 Such a recovery chip
is identical to the SPR screening chip, but the ligand binding interaction
is reversed, i.e., immobilized antibodies on the chip to trap sufficient
numbers of analyte molecules for chemical identification (Figure S4D). Thus, the contaminated beer sample
was reinjected into the SPR apparatus but now onto a chip containing
the anti-DON followed by washing with HBS-EP and water (Figure S4D). The chip
was then taken out of the SPR instrument, dried with nitrogen, and
analyzed using the Biochip Spray MS (Figure 3). In addition to the expected ions for DON,
ions of D3G (m/z 481.1680, [D3G
+ Na]+) and acetyl DON (ADON, m/z 339.1438, [ADON + H]+) were observed. Both
D3G and ADON are conjugates of DON known to cross-react with anti-DON.28 No ions from nivalenol (NIV) were visible, and
this is in-line with our previous SPR research, in which no cross-reactivity
was observed.28

([ADON + H]+), recorded in positive ion mode obtained from
a CMD-modified gold chip with immobilized anti-DON. The chip was loaded
in an iSPR apparatus, and naturally contaminated beer was injected,
followed by washing with buffer and water and transferring to the
Biochip Spray MS setup.

To conclude, a simplified coupling of SPR with MS through
direct
Biochip Spray was developed that allows chemical identification of
low molecular weight analytes in SPR ligand binding assays. The technique
is based on selective capturing of a target analyte on an SPR biosensor
chip containing antibodies (or any other biorecognition element),
followed by identification of the analyte as well as any (un)expected
cross-reacting conjugates using ambient ionization MS directly from
the gold SPR chip. The method may be applied for those samples, which
give a response in either indirect or direct SPR biosensor screening
modes (it is fair to say that not many low molecular weight analytes
will yield a significant response in the direct SPR mode). The aforementioned
method is, in principle, generic and could be applied to any MS-amenable
analyte provided that antibodies are available and that they can be
immobilized on an SPR chip. In this work, the antibodies were immobilized
via the amine group and thus randomly oriented on the surface. Approaches
for oriented immobilization of antibodies could be explored for better
antigen binding and thus stronger signals in the MS. A 4-plex imaging
SPR (iSPR) approach in which each corner of the biochip contains a
different capturing antibody with the corresponding analyte that can
be subsequently identified by Biochip Spray MS can be envisaged.
