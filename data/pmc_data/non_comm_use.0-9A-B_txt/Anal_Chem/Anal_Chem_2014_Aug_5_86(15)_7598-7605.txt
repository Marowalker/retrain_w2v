Understanding how newly engineered
micro- and nanoscale materials
and systems that interact with cells impact cell physiology is crucial
for the development and ultimate adoption of such technologies. Reports
regarding the genotoxic impact of forces applied to cells in such
systems that can both directly or indirectly damage DNA emphasize
the need for developing facile methods to assess how materials and
technologies affect cell physiology. To address this need we have
developed a TurboRFP-based DNA damage reporter cell line in NIH-3T3
cells that fluoresce to report genotoxic stress caused by a wide variety
of agents, from chemical genotoxic agents to UV-C radiation. Our biosensor
was successfully implemented in reporting the genotoxic impact of
nanomaterials, demonstrating the ability to assess size dependent
geno- and cyto-toxicity. The biosensor cells can be assayed in a high
throughput, noninvasive manner, with no need for overly sophisticated
equipment or additional reagents. We believe that this open-source
biosensor is an important resource for the community of micro- and
nanomaterials and systems designers and users who wish to evaluate
the impact of systems and materials on cell physiology.

==== Body
The use of
micro- and nanoscale
technologies for biological and medical applications has rapidly advanced
in recent years. These technologies have been applied in techniques
and platforms for toxicology assessment,1,2 organ-on-a-chip
devices for tissue-engineering,3−5 biomedical microelectromechanical
systems (Bio-MEMS) for microscale cell manipulation and assessment,6−8 and nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems.9,10 Such
approaches offer low-cost and/or new functionality for biological,
chemical, pharmaceutical, and environmental applications. Critical
in the development of newly engineered micro- and nanoscale materials
and systems that interact with cells is the understanding how they
impact cell physiology. The geometry and chemistry of nanomaterials
and the forces applied on cells in microsystems can both affect cell
physiology. Reports regarding the cytotoxic impact of techniques and
materials in wide use today2,11−14 emphasize the importance of developing facile methods to assess
how materials and technologies affect cell physiology. DNA damage
in particular can occur via a variety of mechanisms that are relevant
to micro- and nanosystems. Forces applied to cells in such systems
can both directly or indirectly damage DNA via reactive oxygen species
(ROS).11,15−21 Exposure of cells to light of varying wavelengths,21 heat,22 electric fields,19 and magnetic fields23 has been linked to direct or indirect DNA damage. ROS-induced DNA
damage can be caused by a variety of nanomaterials used for biomedical
applications,2,12−14,24,25 including commercially
available silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs),14,26 which have a number of therapeutic uses.27

One important concern when developing microsystems and nanomaterials
for biomedical applications is with sublethal genotoxic effects. Some
of these effects can disrupt DNA integrity without leading to overt
cell death and therefore can remain elusive when examining viability.
To assay such sublethal genotoxicity, one would ideally want a nondestructive,
quantitative, high-throughput assay that is also reagent-free, in
order to simplify the assay and limit the interactions of tested microsystems
and nanomaterials with any added reagents. Such an assay would allow
the biomedical technology designer or user to optimize their newly
developed system or material. The genotoxicity assays that are used
today include gene expression assays (via RT-PCR),28 single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay),29 γ-H2AX assay,30 and micronucleus (MN) assay.31 These
methods require additional reagents, significant sample preparation,
and biological expertise, and they can be difficult to apply to assess
nanomaterials and microsystems because these assays may be incompatible
with the technology under development (e.g., limited access to cells
in a microsystem). Moreover, as the methods are end point, they prevent
further assessment of the cells’ recovery and long-term survival.

Methods based instead on engineering cells that fluoresce to report
DNA damage have the potential to be reagent-free, simple, and nondestructive.
Indeed, development of cell-based toxicity tests is of growing interest,
and several genotoxicity-reporting cell-based sensors have become
commercially available: the CellSensor beta-lactamase ratiometric
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter assay
(Invitrogen)32 and the GreenScreen assay
(Gentronix Ltd.).33 These assays offer
a high-throughput alternative for DNA damage detection. However, the
requirements for specialized equipment and software needed for FRET-based
measurements, the lack of consensus between different cell biosensor
assays on the reporting gene selected or the fluorophore used,32−34 and the costliness of the commercially available sensors emphasize
the need to expand the toolbox of available genotoxicity monitoring
techniques for use by the nano- and microsystems community for evaluation
and optimization of their newly developed systems and materials. The
use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporting fluorophore
for the aforementioned commercial assay further introduces constraints
limiting multiple fluorescent labeling, since GFP emission shows a
substantial overlap with other fluorophores.

Here we introduce
an open-source cell-based biosensor specifically
engineered to report DNA damage induced by micro- and nanosystems.
The biosensor cells express TurboRFP (red fluorescent protein) fluorescence
allowing visual and nondestructive assessment of gene expression with
single-cell resolution using commonly available equipment to quantify
the cellular fluorescence response without requiring additional reagents
and materials, large numbers of cells, or overly sophisticated microscopy.
We have developed a transcriptional sensor that reports on activation
of p21 protein (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), a crucial node
in the DNA damage pathway. We describe the quantitative characterization
of the biosensor as well as its application to detect stresses caused
by nanomaterials or found in microsystems, specifically Ag-NPs and
ROS. The DNA-damage-reporting biosensor presented here offers new
possibilities for user-friendly and cost-efficient assessment of DNA
damage in a variety of nano- and microsystems.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
NIH-3T3 cells, obtained from ATCC, were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 2% (v/v) l-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin. All cell
culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise noted. Cells
were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were plated to reach 70% confluence.

Engineering the DNA Damage Cell-Based Biosensor
We
engineered a reporter gene construct encoding the fluorescent TurboRFP
protein, the expression of which is under the control of the p53-responsive
p21 promoter (refer to the Supporting Information, Methods for a detailed summary of the procedure and the sequence
of the p53-responsive p21 promoter region). This plasmid was deposited
to Addgene (the plasmid number is 52432). The NIH-3T3 cells were transfected
using Superfect (Qiagen), selected using selection medium containing
1 mg/mL genetecin (G418) for stably transfected clones, and single-cell
cloned (see the Supporting Information,
Methods for a more detailed procedure). The isogenic clones were expanded
and then assayed to find the clone with the highest fluorescent response
to DNA damage.

Quantitative Characterization of the Biosensor
Using DNA-Damaging
Agents
DNA damage was induced with well-characterized DNA-damaging
agents: methylmethanesulfonate (MMS; Sigma-Aldrich) and UV-C (254
nm) by using a Spectrolinker XL-1500 UV cross-linker (Spectronics
Corporation). MMS was diluted in cell culture medium not supplemented
with bovine calf serum immediately before use at concentrations of
0.05–1.5 mM. Cells were incubated in cell culture medium with
MMS for 4 h, then washed with PBS, and incubated in normal cell culture
medium until further analysis. The control cells were exposed to the
same medium without MMS and to the same number of washes. Cellular
response to UV induced DNA damage was assessed using doses of 8, 20,
and 35 J/m2. Biosensor cells were washed with PBS prior
to the UV exposure and after the exposure incubated in normal cell
culture medium until further analysis. The control cells were placed
outside the incubator for the same amount of time as UV-exposed biosensor
cells and were washed the same number of times with PBS. The red fluorescence
response of the biosensor cells was determined at different time points
after exposure using flow cytometry (FC).

Pathway Validation
To assess the dependence of TurboRFP
expression on p53-pathway activation, the biosensor cells were transfected
with p53 shRNA (small hairpin RNA) plasmid (Addgene plasmid 12090)
directed against mouse p53.35 Enhanced-GFP
(EGFP) is expressed from this plasmid as a marker. EGFP-positive cells
were isolated after 6 days using a MoFlo flow sorter and expanded
for 7 days before MMS induction. Cells were exposed to MMS for 4 h
and analyzed after 24 h.

Cell Viability
Cell viability following
exposure to
different MMS concentrations was assessed by staining cells (including
the cells in supernatant) with 1 μM Sytox-Blue (Invitrogen)
for 5–30 min and analyzing them using FC. The percentage of
dead cells was determined by Sytox-Blue positive cells. The fold-induction
of red fluorescence was determined from the Sytox-Blue-negative cell
population.

Comet Assay
Biosensor cells were
treated with MMS diluted
in cell culture medium not supplemented with bovine calf serum at
concentrations of 0.05–1.5 mM. The control cells were exposed
to the same medium without MMS and to the same number of washes. The
comet assay was done as previously described36 (see the Supporting Information, Methods
for a more detailed procedure).

Treatment of the DNA Damage
Biosensor with Ag-NPs
Spherical
Ag-NPs (10 nm, 100 nm) were purchased from nanoComposix as 1 000
mg/L in a 2 mM sodium citrate buffer (BioPure aqueous suspensions)
and were stored in the dark at 4 °C. Dilutions were created by
mixing with cell culture medium. Biosensor cells were exposed to 1–100
μg/mL of silver nanoparticles for 12–48 h, trypsinized,
and analyzed using FC. Control biosensor cells were exposed to cell
culture medium with sodium citrate buffer.

Quantitative Characterization
of the Sensor in Response to H2O2 Exposure
The DNA damage biosensor cells
were exposed to the culture medium containing the indicated concentration
of H2O2 (25–500 μM), with or without
catalase (100 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), for 4 h, at which time cells
where washed and incubated in normal cell culture medium until further
analysis. The response of biosensor cells to H2O2 was compared to the response of cells pretreated with catalase (100
mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h prior to adding H2O2.

Imaging
Images were acquired with an Axiovert 200 M
microscope (Zeiss) fitted with a cooled CCD camera LaVision ImagerQE
(LaVision) and an automated stage Ludl MAC 5000 (Ludl) using 10×
and 20× objectives. Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) was
used to control the microscope. Fluorescent images were acquired using
a TRITC filter (for TurboRFP) and FITC filter for EGFP. Images were
analyzed using ImageJ.

Flow Cytometry Analysis
The biosensor
cells were trypsinized
(Gibco), diluted in FACS buffer (95% (v/v) PBS, 5% (v/v) BCS, 1% (v/v)
penicillin-streptomycin), and transported on ice to the Swanson Biotechnology
Center Flow Cytometry Facility (Koch Institute, MIT). The red fluorescence
response of the DNA damage reporter cells was analyzed by an LSR II
HTS flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using a PETexasRed-YG-A (Red channel)
filter (561 nm excitation and 610 ± 20 nm emission). The FITC
channel (488 nm excitation and 530 ± 30 nm emission wavelengths)
was used either as a reference channel or for green fluorescence (EGFP)
detection. Side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) gates were
set to exclude debris. Untransfected NIH-3T3 cells and stable RFP-expressing
cells were used as controls. A minimum of 1500 events was collected
per sample. The maximum background fluorescence from the untransfected
NIH-3T3 cells was set as the threshold and the cells with the red
fluorescent values above this threshold were termed “activated
cells”. To obtain the fold-induction of the red fluorescence
of biosensor cells in response to DNA damage, the mean red fluorescence
of the cells exposed to a DNA damaging agent was divided by the mean
red florescence of the control (not exposed to genotoxic agent) population
of biosensor cells. Flow cytometry data was collected and analyzed
using FACSDiva (San Jose, California) and FlowJo (Ashland, OR) software.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical significance of
the differences between fold-inductions of mean red fluorescence was
conducted using two-tailed Student’s t test,
considering p < 0.05 as significant and one-way
ANOVA and Dunnett’s test with P < 0.05
(GraphPad Prism 5 software) to compare the fold-induction of red fluorescence
caused by different concentrations of the stressors to the fold-induction
of the control cells at each time point. The control biosensor cells
were exposed to the same conditions as the stressed biosensor cells,
except the stressor agent itself and were compared to the untreated
biosensor cells to measure their red fluorescence fold-induction.
For all analysis: ∗ = p-value < 0.05.

Results
Selection of the DNA Damage-Reporting Cell-Based Biosensor
Cells respond to DNA damage by halting cell cycle progression,
which leads to p53-mediated cell cycle arrest37 in order to enable the cell to perform DNA repair processes. Genes
that are activated in response to DNA damaging stress have been extensively
studied and characterized;37−39 they include the canonical p53
pathway. The major downstream target gene of active p53 transcription
factor is p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor),40,41 which inhibits both the transition from G1 to S and from G2 to mitosis,41,42 as well as DNA replication.43 Elevation
of p21 expression in response to DNA damage has been previously found
both in vivo and in vitro.44−46 Hence, our approach for creating
a biosensor to report on DNA damage was to construct a cell-cycle
arrest sensor by fusing the p53-responsive p21 promoter with the fluorescent
reporter protein TurboRFP, similar to an approach previously implemented
in our lab to develop a cell-based biosensor to report on heat shock
pathway activation.47

We chose to
create the sensor in the NIH-3T3 cell line as it is a commonly used
fibroblast cell line that is simple to culture, the DNA damage response
has been extensively studied in these cells, and they express wild-type
p53 protein.48,49 We created a plasmid containing
the full-length (667 base-pairs) p21 promoter upstream of TurboRFP
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Upon stable transfection we single-cell cloned the mixed population
of cells to achieve a clonal population. Clones that stably incorporate
foreign DNA can demonstrate a wide variation in recombinant gene expression.
The reason for this can be the positional effects, in which different
regions of the chromosome modulate transgene expression. In order
to minimize this heterogeneity and to achieve more consistent performance
we used an approach that was previously used for cell-based toxicity
assay development, namely, selecting the highest producing clone.34,47 We examined the clones for RFP induction and for the percentage
of positive cells, setting the threshold for determining positive
cells from the brightest autofluorescence signal from untransfected
NIH-3T3 cells. The screening of the clones for RFP induction was performed
using flow cytometry after exposure of the cells to methylmethanesulfonate
(MMS) as a genotoxic agent. MMS is a DNA alkylating agent that causes
random single- and double-strand DNA breaks. It is a well-characterized
DNA damaging agent that induces the transitory delay of DNA replication.
Its ease of use and its rapid uptake by cells made it a reagent of
choice for selection and characterization of the DNA-damage reporter
clone. Cells were exposed to MMS (1 mM) for 4 h and analyzed 24 h
later using FC.

We screened 50 clones (Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information). As expected, each clone had different characteristics
regarding the expression of red fluorescent protein before and after
induction (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). We compared different clones according to the fold-induction of
the mean red fluorescence and the percentage of positive cells.

Examining two clones in detail (clone 81, clone 19) gives insight
into the different responses observed (Figure 1A). The control populations of these clones differ in % positive
and in mean intensity: clone 19 had 2.85% positive cells with mean
fluorescence of the entire control population of 60.8 (arbitrary units),
whereas clone 81 cells that had only 0.029% positive red cells with
a mean red fluorescence of 38.5 (arbitrary units) 24 h after exposure
to MMS (1 mM). Clone 81 cells showed a substantial population shift
(Figure 1A), with 74.5% cells expressing RFP
(mean fluorescence 3331, 86.5 times higher than the control), compared
to clone 19 with only 16.6% red cells after induction with mean fluorescence
intensity of 191 (Figure 1A), only 3 times
higher than the mean fluorescence intensity of the control population.
After analyzing all 50 clones, we found that clone 81 displayed both
the highest fold-induction of the mean red fluorescence and the highest
percentage of red cells. Because of both the low red fluorescence
signal of the control unstressed cells and the high induction of the
RFP after exposure to genotoxic agent, as compared to other clones,
clone 81 was selected as our biosensor. Additionally, to demonstrate
that the selected biosensor cells are amenable to assessment by microscopy,
imaging before and after DNA damage induction showed visible activation
of the reporter (Figure 1B).

clones, 81 and 19 (blue-control unstressed cells; red-cells exposed

before and after 1 mM MMS exposure for 4 h. Images were taken 24 h
after the exposure. Stressed cells expressed the red fluorescence,
showing visible activation of the reporter. Scale bar 100 μm.

Validation of the Dependence
of TurboRFP Expression on p53-Pathway
Activation
To assess the specificity of our biosensor, we
examined its response upon pathway inhibition. We knocked down p53
by transfecting the sensor with a plasmid containing an EGFP (enhanced
GFP) marker and a p53 shRNA (small hairpin RNA) directed against mouse
p53. Cells that were EGFP-negative turned red upon MMS induction,
whereas EGFP-positive cells were not red (Figure 2A,B). Fold-induction of mean red fluorescence was 16 ±
0.5 in EGFP– cells and was significantly reduced
to 5.6 ± 0.3 in - EGFP+ cells (P <
0.05) (Figure 2A,C), indicating that cells
that were transfected with p53 shRNA (green) were inhibited in their
ability to express TurboRFP. This inhibition demonstrated that p53
is required for RFP expression in our biosensors and thus that the
expression of TurboRFP is driven by p53-induced transcription.

and with (MMS) exposure to 1 mM MMS. Scale bar is 100 μm. Cells

MMS. EGFP– cells are derived from Q1 and Q4 of part
B, right scatter plot, and EGFP+ cells are from Q2 and

Response of DNA Damage Biosensors to MMS
We next characterized
the dynamics and dose-dependence of the DNA damage biosensor response
to MMS. MMS concentrations above 0.65 mM caused significant red fluorescence
induction compared to the controls (Figure 3A). Higher MMS concentrations resulted in a graded dose-dependent
increase in fold-induction of TurboRFP levels, reaching the highest
response using an MMS concentration of 1 mM. Above this concentration,
cells displayed no additional increases in fold-induction of red fluorescence
signal, reaching a plateau. At concentrations of 1.2 mM and above,
fold TurboRFP induction decreased, consistent with the observation
that at these concentrations the percentage of dead cells started
to increase above the baseline (Figure S3A in the Supporting Information), indicating the onset of MMS cytotoxicity.
Since dead cells tend to be lost during sample processing for FC,
the fluorescence decrease in Figure 3A likely
occurred due to the loss of the brightest (and thus most damaged)
cells as they die. Correlation of fold-induction obtained 24 h after
exposure with single-cell comet assay36 (Figure S3B,C in the Supporting Information) at MMS concentrations of 0.05–1 mM confirmed a monotonic
relationship between DNA damage and fold-induction of red fluorescence,
showing a linear relationship between the red fold-induction and DNA
damage measured by comet assay starting from 36% DNA in the tail (R2 = 0.99) (Figure S3C in the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 (A) Mean fold-induction of TurboRFP expression
in biosensor cells
treated with increasing MMS concentrations; analyzed using FC 24 h
after 4 h exposure. (B) Time dependence of fold-induction of TurboRFP
expression in response to different MMS concentrations (n ≥ 3; error bars, standard error of mean).

Next we examined the dynamics of activation. The
rise in TurboRFP
fluorescence in response to MMS was time-dependent, as reflected in
the increase of the mean red fluorescence fold-induction over time,
with different concentrations of MMS exhibiting different dynamics
(Figure 3B). After 12 h, the biosensor cells
exposed to 0.5 and 1 mM MMS concentrations showed significant increase
in expression of TurboRFP. After 24 h, the fluorescence of cells exposed
to 0.5 mM MMS plateaued and then decreased after 36 h, suggesting
that the cells were recovering from the stress. Fluorescence in cells
exposed to 1 mM MMS stayed elevated for at least 48 h.

DNA-Damage
Biosensors’ Response to UV Radiation
To assay the
response of the biosensor to other common DNA damaging
agents, we exposed it to UV-C radiation. Using radiation allowed us
to induce DNA damage free from limitations of chemical uptake and
metabolism.50 UV-C is a well-characterized
genotoxic agent that is used to study DNA damage and repair.51 Recently it has become relevant in various medical
applications, including acting as an anticancer agent52 and as a disinfectant for localized treatments of multidrug-resistant
infections.53 Cells exposed to 20 J/m2 and 35 J/m2 doses of UV-C showed a significant
increase in fluorescence after 12 h (Figure 4). Biosensor cells’ response to 20 J/m2 and 35
J/m2 UV-C showed further induction after 24 h, with higher
levels of fold-induction in response to 35 J/m2. This response
stayed relatively constant for up to 48 h.

Figure 4 Dose and time response
of DNA-damage biosensor cells to UV-C. Exposed
cells were analyzed using FC at different time points after exposure,
and the mean red fluorescence intensity was compared to the mean red
fluorescence intensity of the control biosensor cells (n = 3; error bars, standard error of mean).

DNA-Damage Biosensors’ Response to Silver Nanoparticles
(Ag-NPs)
To demonstrate the use of the biosensor in a nanotechnological
application, we implemented it to assay genotoxicity of Ag-NPs. Ag-NPs
are widely used in biomedical research and for therapeutic purposes
due to their electrical conductivity54 and
antimicrobial properties.27 Recent reports
about the genotoxic potential of this nanomaterial has sparked significant
interest in this aspect of Ag-NPs’ impact on cell physiology.14,26 Here a benefit of the biosensor is the simplicity of assay: simply
add the Ag-NPs into a microtiter plate containing the cells and then
read on a flow cytometer, allowing assay of many conditions (particle
types, concentrations, and durations). Exposure of biosensor cells
to Ag-NPs and analysis of their red fluorescence induction using FC
showed a significant response to 10 and 100 nm Ag-NPs at concentrations
of 50 and 100 μg/mL starting at 12 h of exposure (Figure 5). After 24 h of exposure to 10 μg/mL of 10
nm Ag-NPs, biosensor cells exhibited a significant fold-induction
of red fluorescence, similar to the response of 100 μg/mL of
the 100 nm Ag-NPs, suggesting that the 10 nm nanoparticles were more
genotoxic than the 100 nm nanoparticles. Lower concentration of 10
nm NPs resulted in no significant fluorescence induction. For the
100 nm NPs after 48 h of exposure, 50 μg/mL caused significant
TurboRFP induction, as high as that caused by 10 μg/mL of the
10 nm Ag-NPs. Exposure of cells to 100 μg/mL of the 100 nm Ag-NPs
after 48 h resulted in a decrease in mean fold-induction of red fluorescence,
probably due to the decrease in cell viability caused by the long
exposure (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). For the 10 nm Ag-NPs, meanwhile, concentrations of 50 and 100
μg/mL resulted in significant cell loss (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The apparent increased
toxicity of the smaller Ag-NPs is in agreement with published reports
assaying the size-dependent toxicity of Ag-NPs.55,56

Figure 5 Dose
and time response of DNA-damage reporter cells to Ag-NPs.
Exposed cells were analyzed using FC at different time points after
exposure and the mean red fluorescence intensity was compared to the
mean red fluorescence intensity of the control biosensor cells (n = 3; error bars, standard error of mean).

DNA-Damage Biosensors’ Response to
Oxidative Stress
Oxidative stress is a common adverse outcome
caused by various
forces and materials used or generated in micro- and nanosystems,
such as electric fields,57 heat,47 and various nanoparticles,2,13,14,24 which perturbs
the balance between intracellular formation and degradation of ROS.
Reflecting the importance of ROS as a stress agent, we characterized
the response of the biosensor to ROS. Addition of exogenous H2O2 mimics cellular oxidative stress because of
the permeability of cell membranes to this small molecule. Sensors
exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide showed time-
and dose-dependent induction of fluorescence (Figure 6). Significant induction of TurboRFP expression was observed
for H2O2 concentrations ≥100 μM
12 h after exposure. Fluorescence of cells exposed to 500 μM
H2O2 plateaued after 24 h at a level of fold-induction
similar to that reached by cells exposed to 300 μM H2O2 after 48 h. To determine the specificity of the response
to ROS, we pretreated biosensor cells with catalase, a ROS scavenger
enzyme. Pretreatment abrogated induction of TurboRFP expression in
response to H2O2 at all concentrations and times
assayed, demonstrating the specificity of the damage mechanism.

Figure 6 Dose and time
response of DNA-damage biosensor cells to H2O2 analyzed using FC. Pretreatment of the biosensor cells
with ROS scavenger enzyme catalase (100 mg/mL) resulted in an attenuation
of the biosensor activation (n = 3; error bars, standard
error of mean).

Discussion
Understanding
how newly engineered micro- and nanoscale materials
and systems, meant to interact with cells, impact the physiology of
those cells is critical when developing such systems and for their
ultimate adoption. Reports regarding the cytotoxic impact of micro-
and nanoscale techniques and materials that are in wide use today
for biological and medical applications2,11−14,58 emphasize the importance of developing
facile methods to assess this impact on cell physiology. Viability
is important and straightforward to assess but does not report on
sublethal stresses. Cell morphology and growth can report on sublethal
stresses, but their limited specificity precludes identification of
the causes of any observed changes in morphology or growth.

Gene expression28 (via RT-PCR), comet
assay,29 γ-H2AX assay,30 and micronucleus (MN) assay31 are common ways to assess sublethal DNA damage but can
be difficult to apply to micro- and nanoscale materials and systems
because the assays may be incompatible with the technology under development
(e.g., limited access to cells in a microsystem).

Fluorescence
reporter assays using stable reporter cell lines have
several appealing features for these applications. First, they are
easy to implement, only requiring a flow cytometer or a microscope.
They are nondestructive to the cells and are thus compatible with
downstream assays (such as a viability assay, Figure S3A in the Supporting Information). They are typically reagent-free,
and so work with materials and systems with reagent addition is difficult.
All these features lead to throughputs compatible with testing across
different conditions. Indeed several cell-based sensors have been
developed to assess DNA damage.32−34,59 Each is different either in the gene whose activation they report
on33 or in the reporter fluorophore used.32−34 However, the commercially available cell-based assays, such as CellSensor
(Invitrogen) and GreenScreen assay (Gentronix) are expensive, $10 000
for a vial and $5 000 for a kit, respectively. In addition,
these assays have not been evaluated across different types of genotoxic
stressors. Also when the GreenScreen assay (yeast background cells)
was used to evaluate various engineered nanomaterials, no measurable
genotoxicity was shown for different genotoxic nanoparticles, including
10 nm Ag-NPs, in contrast to the sensor reported here (Figure 5).60

Here we introduced
an open-source biosensor specifically engineered
to report on DNA damage induced by micro- and nanosystems. This transcriptional
sensor reports on activation of p21, a crucial and well-characterized
node in the DNA damage and cell cycle arrest pathway, via p53-driven
TurboRFP protein expression. The biosensor allows visual and nondestructive
assessment of gene expression with single-cell resolution using commonly
available equipment to quantify the cellular fluorescence response
without requiring additional reagents and materials, large numbers
of cells, or overly sophisticated microscopy. We engineered the biosensor
cells to use TurboRFP because of its intracellular stability, which
allows RFP to be assayed over a range of times and because its spectral
characteristics allows it to be more-easily multiplexed with other
assays than a GFP-based reporter. We chose NIH-3T3 cells as the background
because they are one of the most commonly used fibroblast cell lines,
are very easy to culture, express wild type p53 protein, and have
been extensively studied for DNA damage,48,49 showing sensitivity to different types of genotoxic agents. We have
also deposited the reporter plasmid in Addgene for users wishing to
create the sensor in different background cells to get specific stress
responses, while our biosensor is available from us upon request.
After validating that expression of TurboRFP was dependent on the
p53 availability, we characterized our biosensor using agents with
known genotoxic function. The biosensor cells were exposed to a range
of concentrations, from very low concentration that did not induce
significant fluorescence responses up to concentrations that were
cytotoxic and caused cell death, in order to determine the dynamics
of the dose- and time-response. Most genotoxic agents at high enough
concentration induced a significant response of the biosensor 12 h
after exposure, including MMS, UV-C, hydrogen peroxide, and Ag-NPs,
but at this time point it was not always possible to distinguish between
responses to different doses or concentrations. At exposure times
of ≥24 h it was possible to detect the fold-induction of red
fluorescence caused by lower but nevertheless genotoxic concentrations
of the stressors. Thus, it is likely that for most applications read-out
at ∼24 h following exposure will be optimal. This read-out
time is similar to those of commercially available cell-based assays,
which also range between 24 and 48 h. The sensitivity of our biosensor
for MMS genotoxicity detection is similar to that of the GreenScreen
assay.33

To illustrate use cases
for both nanomaterials and microsystems,
we exposed biosensor cells to Ag-NPs and to hydrogen peroxide (a common
stressor found in microsystems). The biosensor cells responded to
the stressors in ways consistent with published observations55,56 (e.g., the difference in apparent toxicity between 10 and 100 nm
diameter Ag-NPs, reporting higher toxicity for smaller nanoparticles).
These assays also illustrate how designers might interpret the results
of assays; they provide a relative measure of genotoxicity rather
than an absolute one. In practice, then, we envision users comparing
fold-induction across conditions/systems and picking the condition/system
with the minimal fold-induction, rather than use the fold-induction
as an absolute metric of genotoxicity.

Conclusion
We
have develop a TurboRFP-based DNA damage reporter cell line
in NIH-3T3 cells that showed the ability to report genotoxic stress
caused by wide variety of agents, from chemical genotoxic agents to
UV-C radiation. In addition, the biosensors were successfully implemented
in reporting the genotoxic impact of nanomaterials, demonstrating
the ability to assess size dependent geno- and cyto-toxicity. The
biosensor cells can be assayed in a high-throughput, noninvasive manner,
with no need for sophisticated equipment or reagents. This open-source
biosensor now serves as an important resource for the community of
micro- and nanosystems and materials designers and users who wish
to evaluate the impact of the systems and materials on cell physiology.
