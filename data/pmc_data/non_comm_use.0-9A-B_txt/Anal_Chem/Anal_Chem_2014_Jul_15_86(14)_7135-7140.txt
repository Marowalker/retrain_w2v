Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
is an integral signaling molecule
in biology with complex generation, translocation, and metabolism
processes that are intertwined with cellular thiols. Differentiating
the complex interplay between H2S and biological thiols,
however, remains challenging due to the difficulty of monitoring H2S and thiol levels simultaneously in complex redox environments.
As a step toward unraveling the complexities of H2S and
thiols in sulfur redox homeostasis, we present a dual-fluorophore
fragmentation strategy that allows for the ratiometric determination
of relative H2S and cysteine (Cys) or homocysteine (Hcy)
concentrations, two important metabolites in H2S biosynthesis.
The key design principle is based on a nitrobenzofurazan-coumarin
(NBD-Coum) construct, which fragments into spectroscopically
differentiable products upon nucleophilic aromatic substitution with
either H2S or Cys/Hcy. Measurement of the ratio of fluorescence
intensities from coumarin and the NBD-Cys or NBD-Hcy adducts generates
a sigmoidal response with a dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude.
The developed scaffold displays a rapid response (<1 min) and is
selective for sulfhydryl-containing nucleophiles over other reactive
sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen species, including alcohol- and amine-functionalized
amino acids, polyatomic anionic sulfur species, NO, and HNO. Additionally, NBD-Coum is demonstrated to differentiate and report on different
oxidative stress stimuli in simulated sulfur pools containing H2S, Cys, and cystine.

Hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) has emerged as an integral biological signaling
molecule since
its discovery as the third gasotransmitter.1−5 Produced endogenously from cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), and
cystathionine, enzymatic H2S biosynthesis occurs primarily
from cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) in the brain, cystathionine-γ-lyase
(CSE) in the liver and kidneys, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
(3-MST) in mitochondria. Once produced, H2S exerts important
effects on vasorelaxation, inflammation, cell angiogenesis, hippocampal
memory formation, and hepatic circulation.1,6−11 Additionally, abnormal H2S levels are implicated in central
nervous system diseases such as Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s
disease.12,13 Paralleling these diverse biological roles,
basal concentrations of free H2S are dynamic, interdependent
with biological thiol concentrations, and sensitive to changes in
redox homeostasis. As substrates in H2S biosynthesis, fluctuations
in Cys and Hcy concentrations can dramatically affect the kinetics
of H2S generation in enzymatic trans-sulfuration pathways.14 Post-translational modification of Cys protein
residues via oxidative S-sulfhydration to form hydrodisulfides
(-SSH) or persulfides is also postulated to be an important H2S storage mechanism, which modifies the antioxidant and signal
transduction activity of H2S.15−18 Deconvoluting cellular H2S generation, translocation, and metabolism steps is difficult,
however, and chemists have been challenged to develop more accurate
experimental methodologies for observing these processes. In particular,
methods for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of H2S and thiols would provide new insight into these multifaceted
biological interactions.

Heightened research interest into the
physiological properties
of H2S has led to the development of small molecule fluorescent
probes which are able to more easily detect and quantify H2S. Historical techniques for H2S detection including gas
chromatography, colorimetry, the methylene blue assay, and sulfur-selective
electrodes all have limitations such as complex workups, slow response
rates, and limited sensitivity.19−23 One major challenge is differentiating between H2S and
thiols due to their similar modes of chemical reactivity. Recognizing
and exploiting particular differences in H2S and thiol
reactivity, however, has been a key driver toward developing the rapidly
emerging suite of small molecule fluorescent probes for H2S. For example, although H2S and thiols are both reducing
agents, H2S reduces azide and nitro groups at a much faster
rate than do thiols. Consequently, the selective H2S-mediated
reduction of azide- and nitro-functionalized fluorophores to elicit
a fluorescent response has been used as one strategy for H2S detection and imaging.24−39 Other strategies, including the double-nucleophilic attack of H2S to release or change the photophysical properties of a bound
fluorophore40−45 and H2S-mediated metal sulfide precipitation from fluorophore-ligated
metals,46−51 have also been utilized for sulfide detection.

Several ratiometric
probes have been developed for H2S, which have appealing
characteristics compared with chemodosimeter
probes.52−57 The magnitude of fluorescence response with chemodosimeters is dependent
on probe concentration, meaning that spatial variations in probe concentration
caused by differential probe association with components of cellular
milieu will reduce the accuracy and reliability of these platforms.
Reaction-based ratiometric probes help to alleviate the problem of
differential probe distribution by providing monitorable fluorescence
emissions at two separate wavelengths, often corresponding to the
unreacted probe and its subsequent reaction product. The ratio of
these two fluorescence signals functions as an inherent self-calibration,
decoupling the observed fluorescence response from probe concentration.
A desirable extension of this strategy would be to monitor an additional
species by fluorescence, thus allowing for the ratiometric determination
of two different analytes simultaneously. To help unravel the intricacies
of sulfur redox homeostasis, including H2S and thiol chemistry;
a platform that could report on both H2S and thiols simultaneously
would provide a way to differentiate between their respective concentrations,
with long-term potential applications in diseases in which H2S and thiol concentrations are correlated.

As a proof of concept
toward these long-term goals, we report herein
the development and application of a platform for the ratiometric
detection of H2S and Cys or Hcy based on a dual-fluorophore
fragmentation strategy.

mesh) was used for column chromatography. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500
MHz NMR instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million
relative to residual protic solvent resonances. UV–visible
spectra were acquired on a Cary 100 spectrometer equipped with a Quantum

0.05 °C. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Quanta Master
40 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) equipped with
a Quantum Northwest TLC-50 temperature controller at 25.0 ± 0.05
°C.

Spectroscopic Materials and Methods
Piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)
(PIPES, Aldrich) and potassium chloride (99.999%, Aldrich) were used
to make buffered solutions (50 mM PIPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) in Millipore
water. Anhydrous sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) was purchased from Strem
Chemicals and handled under nitrogen. Angeli’s salt and DEA
NONOate were purchased from Cayman and used to generate HNO and NO,
respectively. Stock solutions of NBD-Coum in DMSO were
prepared in an N2-filled glovebox and stored at −25
°C until immediately prior to use. Stock solutions of l-cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, serine, lysine, threonine,
H2O2, Na2SO3, Na2SO4, and Na2S2O3 in buffer
and tyrosine in 0.1 M NaOH were freshly prepared in a glovebox. Stock
solutions of NaHS in degassed buffer, and Angeli’s salt and
DEA NONOate in degassed 0.01 M NaOH, and l-cystine in degassed
1 M HCl were prepared under nitrogen immediately prior to use. All
absorption and fluorescence measurements were made under anaerobic
conditions, and cuvette solutions were prepared under an inert atmosphere
in septum-sealed cuvettes obtained from Starna Scientific.

General
Procedure for Fluorescence and Selectivity Measurements
A
cuvette containing 3.0 mL of PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl,
pH 7.4) and a septum cap was prepared in a glovebox. An NBD-Coum stock solution (15 μL, 1.0 mM) was added via syringe to the
cuvette, and initial fluorescence spectra were recorded with excitation/emission
at 400/405–600 nm and 475/485–650 nm. After addition
of a NaHS stock solution (15 μL, 50 mM) via syringe and incubation
at 25 °C for 15 min, fluorescence spectra were again recorded.
For selectivity and ratiometric experiments, the emission maxima at
449 and 549 nm were compared.

General Procedure for the
Ratiometric Detection of H2S and Cysteine
Stock
solutions of NaHS (15 μL, 100
mM) and cysteine (15 μL, 100 mM) were combined and diluted with
PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4, 30 μL) to prepare a
second stock solution containing 50 mM total sulfur content at a desired
1:1 H2S:Cys ratio. The fluorescence response of NBD-Coum was measured upon treatment with this second solution following
the general procedure described above. The H2S:Cys stoichiometry
in each experiment was controlled by varying the isolated H2S or Cys stock solution volumes used to prepare secondary stock solutions
accordingly at the desired ratio.

Procedure for Redox Comparisons
A stock solution of l-cystine was prepared (25 mM) in
1 M HCl. Preliminary stock
solutions of NaHS (15 μL, 100 mM) and cysteine (15 μL,
100 mM) were combined and diluted with PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM
KCl, pH 7.4, 30 μL) to prepare a second stock solution containing
equimolar concentrations of NaSH and Cys (25 mM). A cuvette containing
3.0 mL of PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) and a septum cap
was prepared under ambient atmosphere and purged with N2, air, or O2 for 15 min. The cuvette was then charged
with the NaHS/Cys (15 μL) and cystine (15 μL) stock solutions
and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min to allow for equilibration
of the sulfur pool. The cuvette was then injected with a NBD-Coum stock solution (15 μL, 1.0 mM), incubated an additional 15
min, and the fluorescence response of NBD-Coum at 449
and 549 nm was recorded. For the redox comparisons with NaOCl or TCEP,
a cuvette containing 3.0 mL of PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH
7.4) and a septum cap was prepared under ambient atmosphere. The cuvette
was then charged with stock solutions of TCEP or NaOCl (15 μL,
50 mM), NaHS/Cys, and cystine and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min.
The cuvette was injected with a NBD-Coum stock solution,
incubated for 15 min, and the fluorescence response of NBD-Coum was measured.

Synthesis of NBD-Coum
A solution
of 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan
(60 mg, 0.32 mmol), 4-methylumbelliferone (42 mg, 0.24 mmol), and
triethylamine (42 μL, 0.32 mmol) in DMF was stirred at room
temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water
and extracted into EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with brine
and dried over Na2SO4 to yield the crude product.

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of NBD-Coum
Although
several ratiometric fluorescent probes for H2S have been
reported, there are no examples of such constructs that report on
the direct measurement of relative H2S and thiol concentrations.
To address this unmet need, we envisioned a reaction-based strategy
that takes advantage of the nucleophilicity of H2S and
Cys/Hcy to cleave a covalent link between two bound fluorophores,
nitrobenzofurazan (NBD) and coumarin. The key design principle is
that reaction with sulfhydryl-containing nucleophiles results in fragmentation
of NBD and coumarin. We demonstrated previously that H2S and thiols readily undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) with electrophilic NBD derivatives to produce NBD-SH and
NBD-SR compounds.58 Upon reaction with
Cys or Hcy, both coumarin and NBD-Cys/Hcy are fluorescent, whereas
reaction with H2S generates coumarin and nonfluorescent
NBD-SH. Coumarin functions as an internal standard and allows for
the ratiometric measurement of NBD-Cys/Hcy versus NBD-SH, and thus
the Cys/Hcy to H2S concentration ratios (Scheme 1).

If each reaction product after reaction
with H2S or Cys provides distinct spectral features, we
hypothesized that each could be monitored independently and used to
determine relative concentrations of H2S and Cys/Hcy in
mixed-analyte environments. Although NBD-SH and NBD-SR are both nonfluorescent,
NBD-adducts of Cys and Hcy undergo subsequent intermolecular rearrangement
with adjacent amine functionalities to form fluorescent amino-bound
NBD-NHR compounds (Scheme 2a, b).59−61 The second fluorophore appended to the NBD scaffold through an ether
linkage provides an additional fluorescent reporter that is liberated
upon nucleophilic substitution. On the basis of this design, the coumarin
fluorescence is directly proportional to the combined H2S and Cys/Hcy concentrations in solution upon fragmentation of the
probe, whereas the NBD component is proportional to the Cys/Hcy concentration
exclusively, given that NBD-SH is nonfluorescent. Conveniently, the
ratiometric probe NBD-Coum was prepared with good yield
in one step from commercially available 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan
(NBD-Cl) and 4-methylumbelliferone (coumarin) in DMF, using NEt3 as a base (Scheme 2c).62

the Fluorescent N-Bound Adducts, and (c) Synthesis
of NBD-Coum
Spectroscopic Characteristics of NBD-Coum
To evaluate the suitability of our design strategy and NBD-Coum as a platform for ratiometric determination of H2S and
Cys/Hcy levels, we first examined its reactivity with sulfhydryl-containing
nucleophiles by UV–vis spectroscopy. Treatment of NBD-Coum (5 μM) with 50 equiv of NaHS, a common H2S source,
in PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) resulted in the rapid
disappearance of NBD-Coum absorbance at 380 nm (<1
min) with concomitant appearance of two absorbances at 322 and 535
nm, corresponding to coumarin and NBD-SH, respectively. These results
confirm that reaction of NBD-Coum with H2S
results in nearly instantaneous probe fragmentation into coumarin
and NBD components. Treatment of NBD-Coum with either
Cys or Hcy resulted in new absorbances centered at 475 nm, consistent
with formation of amino-bound NBD.63 By
contrast, reaction of NBD-Coum with either glutathione
(GSH) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), two thiols lacking
the proximal amines required to undergo the intramolecular rearrangement,
generated an absorbance at 425 nm, consistent with formation of NBD-SR
adducts (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Comparison of the UV–vis
spectra of NBD-Coum (5 μM, black) and the HS-,
RHN-, and RS-bound NBD products
from reactions with 50 equiv of NaHS (250 μM, green), Cys or
Hcy (250 μM, blue), and GSH or NAC (250 μM, red) in PIPES
buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) after incubation at 25 °C.

We next examined the reactivity
of NBD-Coum with H2S and Cys/Hcy by fluorescence
spectroscopy to determine whether
differentiable fluorescent products are produced in each case. In
its unreacted state, NBD-Coum is nonfluorescent due to
self-quenching of the bound coumarin and NBD fluorophores. Treatment
of NBD-Coum with 50 equiv of NaHS resulted in ejection
of the coumarin fluorophore and generation of a strong emission band
centered at 449 nm. As established previously, NBD-SH is nonfluorescent
due to the high acidity of the sulfhydryl proton and consequent deprotonation
at pH 7.4.58 By contrast to the reactivity
observed with NaHS, reaction of NBD-Coum with Cys or
Hcy generated two fluorescent products corresponding to coumarin and
the N-bound Cys/Hcy NBD adducts. Excitation at 322
and 475 nm resulted in two discrete fluorescence signals centered
at 449 and 549 nm corresponding to coumarin and NBD-Cys/Hcy, respectively.
These results are again consistent with the dual-fluorophore fragmentation
design, liberating coumarin upon reaction of NBD-Coum with either H2S or Cys/Hcy, providing an internal standard
for ratiometric differentiation. The resulting NBD product, however,
is nonfluorescent from reaction with H2S and fluorescent
with Cys/Hcy reaction. The 100 nm separation between coumarin and
NBD-Cys/Hcy fluorescence maxima allows for unambiguous measurement
of each signal.

Ratiometric Detection of H2S and
Cys
To
further validate our design strategy, we next investigated the dynamic
range of the system by treating NBD-Coum (5 μM)
with mixed Cys:H2S solutions with stoichiometries ranging
from 1:75 to 75:1, while keeping the total sulfur concentration constant
in all samples (50 equiv). Under these experimental conditions, the
two terminal data points represent 3:247 μM in Cys:H2S and H2S:Cys, respectively; however, lower analyte detection
limits should be accessible using lower probe and/or analyte concentrations.
In each experiment, the fluorescence intensities at 449 nm (coumarin)
and 549 nm (NBD-Cys) were measured.64 As
the [Cys]/[H2S] ratio increases, more NBD-Cys is formed
relative to NBD-SH, thus generating a stronger fluorescent signal
at 549 nm. Consistent with our design hypothesis, the F549/F449 ratio increased accordingly with higher [Cys]/[H2S]. Furthermore, measurement of the ratio of the fluorescence
intensities from coumarin and NBD-Cys generated a sigmoidal response
(R2 = 0.997), which allows for the ratiometric
determination of relative H2S and Cys concentrations with
a dynamic range of nearly 3 orders of magnitude (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Ratiometric response (F549/F449) of NBD-Coum
to varying Cys:H2S stoichiometries (75:1, 20:1, 5:1, 2.5:1,
1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, 1:20, and 1:75). Inset: Resultant fluorescence spectra
from varying Cys:H2S ratios. Normalized coumarin fluorescence
(λex = 400 nm, λem = 449 nm) remains
constant while NBD-Cys fluorescence (λex = 475 nm,
λem = 549 nm) increases with [Cys]/[H2S]. Conditions: 5 μM NBD-Coum, 250 μM combined NaHS +
Cys, PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4). Data were acquired
after 15 min incubation at 25 °C. Each data point represents
the average of three trials. Error bars were calculated as standard
error.

Selectivity of NBD-Coum
Having demonstrated the efficacy
of the NBD-Coum platform in detecting different H2S:Cys ratios, we next investigated the selectivity of the
probe for H2S and Cys/Hcy over other biologically relevant
nucleophiles and reactive sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen species (RSONs). NBD-Coum (5 μM) was treated with 10 equiv of nucleophilic
amino acids (Ser, Tyr, Lys, and Thr), oxidizing agents (H2O2), sulfur anions (SO32–, SO42–, and S2O32–), and reactive nitrogen species (NO and HNO).
In all cases, incubation for 15 min resulted in a negligible fluorescence
response at both 449 and 549 nm (Figure 3).
Treatment of NBD-Coum with GSH released the coumarin
fluorophore and generated S-bound NBD-GSH, which
was essentially nonfluorescent, and no turn-on at 549 nm was observed.
Oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles were insufficiently nucleophilic
at physiological pH to react with NBD-Coum, which indicates
that fragmentation of NBD-Coum into its respective NBD
and coumarin components requires SNAr by stronger sulfhydryl-containing
nucleophiles. Taken together, these selectivity studies highlight
the selectivity of the NBD-Coum scaffold for differentiating
between H2S and Cys/Hcy. Although high levels of GSH would
likely interfere with the ability of NBD-Coum to effectively
differentiate H2S and Cys/Hcy in many live-cell experiments,
studies in blood plasma may still be accessible due to much lower
concentrations of free GSH.

amino acids
and reactive sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen species. From left to right:

NBD-Coum, 50 μM RSONs, PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4),
λex/λem = 400 nm/449 and 475 nm/549.
Data were acquired at 25 °C after 15 min incubation.

Measurement of Redox Changes in Mixed Sulfur
Pools
Sulfur pools of H2S and sulfhydryl-containing
amino acids
and peptides respond continuously to various levels of oxidative stress
in biological systems by undergoing changes in their redox states.
To simulate such changes, we investigated whether NBD-Coum could detect changes in oxidative stress levels in a simulated sulfur
pool consisting of H2S (125 μM), Cys (125 μM),
and cystine (250 μM) (Figure 4). All
experiments were compared to a control case in which the sulfur species
were combined in an N2-purged cuvette. To increase the
oxidative conditions, the sample was bubbled with either air or O2 or alternatively treated with NaOCl. Treatment of the sample
with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), a common reductant used
to reduce disulfides, was used to mimic reductive conditions. In all
cases of induced oxidative stress, the relative ratio of Cys/H2S decreased, which is consistent with Cys oxidation. By contrast,
under reductive conditions, the ratio of Cys/H2S increased,
which is consistent with TCEP-mediated reduction of cystine to Cys.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that NBD-Coum is able to effectively monitor changes in redox state in the sulfur
pool.

Figure 4 Response of the sulfur pool containing H2S, Cys, and
cystine to oxidative and reductive influences. Relative Cys:H2S ratios decrease under oxidative conditions and increase
under reducing conditions. Conditions: The initial sulfur pool (125
μM H2S, 125 μM Cys, 250 μM cystine) was
incubated in PIPES buffer (50 mM, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) for 60 min at
25 °C under each redox condition and treated with 5 μM
NBD-Coum.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated the design and application of a platform to
effectively measure H2S and Cys/Hcy ratios using a dual-fluorophore
fragmentation strategy. The mechanism of action relies not only on
the differences in reactivity of H2S and Cys/Hcy to provide
differentiable reaction products with NBD-Coum but also
in their similarity as potent nucleophiles capable of undergoing SNAr with the electrophilic scaffold. The strategy described
here introduces a new class of compounds that could offer insights
into thiol-H2S dynamics such as redox homeostasis or enzymatic
metabolism.
