Articular
cartilage is exposed to a gradient of oxygen levels ranging
from 5% at the surface to 1% in the deepest layers. While most cartilage
research is performed in supraphysiological oxygen levels (19–21%),
culturing chondrocytes under hypoxic oxygen levels (≤8%) promotes
the chondrogenic phenotype. Exposure of cells to various oxygen levels
alters their lipid metabolism, but detailed studies examining how
hypoxia affects lipid metabolism in chondrocytes are lacking. To better
understand the chondrocyte’s behavior in response to oxygen,
we cultured 3D pellets of human primary chondrocytes in normoxia (20%
oxygen) and hypoxia (2.5% oxygen) and employed matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in order
to characterize the lipid profiles and their spatial distribution.
In this work we show that chondrocytes cultured in hypoxia and normoxia
can be differentiated by their lipid profiles. Among other species,
phosphatidylglycerol species were increased in normoxic pellets, whereas
phosphatidylinositol species were the most prominent lipids in hypoxic
pellets. Moreover, spatial mapping revealed that phospahtidylglyycerol
species were less prominent in the center of pellets where the oxygen
level is lower. Additional analysis revealed a higher abundance of
the mitochondrial-specific lipids, cardiolipins, in normoxic conditions.
In conclusion MALDI-MSI described specific lipid profiles that could
be used as sensors of oxygen level changes and may especially be relevant
for retaining the chondrogenic phenotype, which has important implications
for the treatment of bone and cartilage diseases.

==== Body
Articular
cartilage is an avascular
tissue that mainly consists of extracellular matrix (ECM), synthesized
by its only residing cell: the chondrocyte. This avascularity results
in low oxygen levels of 1–5% to which chondrocytes are well-adapted.1,2 In fact, low oxygen levels promote chondrocyte survival in vitro and increase collagen II, aggrecan, and glycosaminoglycan
levels.3−7 During cartilage degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA),
the inflammatory processes result in more reactive oxygen species
(ROS)8,9 and oxygen levels within the joint are altered.10,11

It is well-known that exposure of cells to various oxygen
levels
alters their lipid metabolism.12−14 Lipids exhibit a wide variety
of cellular functions, such as structural support, energy storage,
protein trafficking, and cell signaling. Recent studies have highlighted
the importance of lipid metabolism in cartilage: for example, cholesterol
has a regulating role in growth plate chondrogenesis and skeletal
development.15,16 Moreover, sphingomyelin-related
lipids, including acid ceramidase, improve the chondrogenesis of bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).17,18

Moreover, recent studies have shown hypercholesterolemia and
altered
levels of sphingolipids in the synovial fluid are related to OA.19 Lipids also accumulate in articular cartilage
during OA, and especially cholesterol and fatty acids are present
in the superficial area of OA cartilage.20 The World Health Organization estimates that 130 million people
worldwide will be afflicted with OA by 2050.21 Obesity, a disorder of lipid metabolism, is one of the main risk
factors for OA.22

Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI) detects thousands of different
molecules while preserving their spatial distribution within one tissue
section. Once an array of mass spectra is obtained, it is possible
to create an image that represents the spatial distribution and relative
abundance of that particular molecule, which can then be correlated
to histological features, such as cartilage ECM deposition.23 The most common MSI methods include time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization (MALDI), and desorption electrospray ionization
(DESI), each with its distinctive capabilities.

Using ToF-SIMS,
we previously showed that the lipid profile of
chondrogenically differentiated human MSCs, primary chondrocytes,
and co-cultures of MSCs and primary chondrocytes are changed in hypoxic
cultures (2.5% O2); in particular, cholesterol was
decreased in hypoxic compared to normoxic cultures.13

Here, we analyzed the lipid profiles of primary human
chondrocytes
in 3D cultures under hypoxic (2.5% O2) and normoxic (20%
O2) conditions. We employed MALDI-MSI to detect a broader
range of molecular species and found distinct lipid profiles for the
chondrocytes cultured in different oxygen conditions.

Materials and
Methods
Donor Material
Articular cartilage was obtained from
five patients (three female and two male) undergoing total knee replacement.
The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 53–72 years; Supporting Information Figure S1). Two representative
biopsies per patient were used for histological evaluation. The remaining
cartilage was used for chondrocyte isolation and subsequent cell culture.
The study was approved by the local hospital ethics committee, and
all patients gave prior informed consent.

Cartilage Biopsies Evaluation
Two biopsies per patient
were formalin-fixed, processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and
stained with safranin O (0.1% in water for 10 min) to evaluate the
degree of OA-related changes. The degree of cartilage damage was assessed
by two independent reviewers according to the OARSI score.24 All donor cartilage biopsies showed histological
changes, including loss of proteoglycans, discontinuous surfaces,
and fissures in the superficial layer to fissures extending into the
deep layers (Figure S1). Structural damage
and cellular changes were graded using the OARSI score and resulted
in an average grade of 3.5 (range, 2.5–4.5).

Cell Culture
Chondrocytes were isolated, as previously
described.25 In short, cartilage matrix
was digested for 20–22 h in collagenase type II (0.15% Worthington)
in DMEM supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100
mg/mL). The digested suspension was filtered through a 100 μm
mesh nylon filter (cell strainer Nucleon) and washed three times with
PBS supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100
mg/mL). Isolated chondrocytes were first expanded in normoxia (20%
O2) or hypoxia (2.5% O2) until passage 4. Subsequently,
high-density micromass cell pellets were formed by seeding 250,000
chondrocytes per well in a round-bottom, low-adherence 96-well plate
and centrifuged for 5 min at 300g. Pellet cultures
were kept in normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (2.5% O2) for 7 days. Chondrocyte proliferation medium (Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1× nonessential amino acids, 0.2 mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate,
0.4 mM proline, 100 U penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin) was
used for all cultures and was refreshed twice a week.

Oil Red O Staining
and Quantification
Pellets embedded
in cryomatrix were sectioned and stained with Oil red O as previously
described.13 Images were acquired using
a Nanozoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Lipid droplet
accumulation was quantified using ImageJ’s color threshold
function26 and revealed a higher abundance
of neutral lipids in pellets cultured in normoxia (Figure S2), which is in line with previously reported results.13

MALDI-MSI Sample Preparation
Three
chondrocyte cell
pellets per donor were embedded in 10% gelatin (Sigma- Aldrich) in
ultrapure water, cut into 10 μm thick sections using a cryostat
(Leica Microsystems), and thaw-mounted on conventional microscope
slides. Slides were stored at −20 °C until further analysis.
Prior to matrix application, slides were placed in a vacuum desiccator
at room temperature for 20 min to be defrosted and dried. For positive
ion mode experiments, 20 layers of 5 mg/mL of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) dissolved in methanol/water
(7:3, v/v) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were applied. Norharmane,
15 layers of 7 mg/mL in chloroform/methanol (2:1, (v/v)), was used
for the negative ion mode analysis. Cell pellets were homogeneously
covered by the matrix solution using the SunCollect spraying device
(SunChrom, Friedrichsdorf, Germany).

MALDI-MSI Acquisition
MALDI-MSI experiments were performed
on a Synapt G2Si HDMS Q-ToF (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Spectra
were acquired at a raster size of 100 μm and in the m/z range of 100–1000, extended
to m/z 2000 for cardiolipin detection.
Both positive and negative ion spectra were obtained in “resolution
MS mode”. The instrument was calibrated using red phosphorus.27 Afterward, the MALDI-MSI sections were stained
with Alcian Blue to visualize cartilage–matrix deposition.

MALDI-MSI Data Analysis
Principal components analysis
(PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to search for
spectral similarities and differences between the samples using an
in-house-built ChemomeTricks toolbox for MATLAB version 2012B (The
MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).28 First, raw
data were converted to a suitable format for BioMap (Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland) at a bin size of m/z 0.05, followed by conversion to a MATLAB format. Subsequently, in
order to only include on-pellet spectra, cell pellet-specific spectra
were selected by making an overlay of the MSI with the Alcian Blue
image of the same section. The in-house-developed PEAPI software was
used for peak-picking28 to reduce the size
of the data and to ensure that each mass channel represents a single
peak. Finally, LDA was performed by employing the double-stage PCA
approach to look for the peaks with the highest differences between
normoxia and hypoxia. After the LDA, images were generated by projection
of the mass spectra of all X, Y positions
(i.e., pixels) on the first discriminant function
(DF1). The resulting score for each spectrum was plotted on its original X, Y position (Figure 1B,D). A two-color scale was used to maximize
the contrast between the positive and negative scoring spectra. Individual m/z values were visualized using BioMap.
These intensity images were normalized to the total ion count (TIC)
per spectrum to eliminate variations due to ionization efficiency,
tissue suppression, or matrix deposition.

Figure 1 Chondrocyte cell pellets
cultured in hypoxia (2.5% O2) and normoxia (20% O2) were analyzed by MALDI-MSI in
negative and positive ion mode. The first discriminant function (DF1)
revealed a clear spectral difference between the oxygen levels in
positive (A) and negative ion mode (C). The projection of DF1 onto
the molecular images showed that the DF1 spectrum was represented
by all donors. For both positive (B) and negative (D) ion mode spectra,
the score projections describe the DF1+ (green) and DF1– (red)
of pellets cultured in normoxia and hypoxia, respectively.

Alcian Blue Staining
Following MALDI-MSI,
sections
were stained for sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) with Alcian Blue
(1%, in water, pH 1.0 adjusted with HCl, 45 min) combined with a Nuclear
Fast Red counterstain (0.1% in 5% aluminum sulfate, 5 min).

Lipid
Identification
Lipid identification was performed
with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in both positive and negative
ion modes using a Synapt G2Si HDMS Q-ToF (Waters) after completing
MALDI-MSI experiments on adjacent sections. Lipid ion precursors were
selected within a 1 Da selection window and fragmented using 20–30
V collision energy applied in the trap cell. The obtained spectra
were processed using MassLynx software (Waters). The MS/MS fragmentation
pattern from each selected mass was used to identify the lipids of
interest and to assign them to previously classified lipid identifications
in the LIPID Metabolites and Pathways Strategy Structure Database
(LMSD; www.lipidmaps.org).

Results
We performed MALDI-MSI on cryosections of chondrocyte
pellets in
both positive and negative ion modes to assess which lipids are altered
by oxygen and to visualize their spatial distribution. PCA followed
by LDA separated the data sets into two groups that readily distinguished
normoxic and hypoxic cultures. For the positive ion spectra, the frequency
plot of the DF1 shows a clear separation between normoxic and hypoxic
cultures and describes 2.04% of the total variance (Figure 1A). Similar to the positive
ion spectra, the frequency plot of the DF1 of the negative ion spectra
shows a separation between normoxic and hypoxic cultures and describes
6.07% of the total variance (Figure 1C). DF1 score images were generated to assess the degree
to which DF1 spectra are represented by the donors. The DF1+ scores
are observed in normoxic pellets and the DF1– scores in hypoxic
pellets (Figure 1B,D).
The score projections consistently represented the DF1 of their respective
culture condition.

Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin Species
Discriminate
between Normoxic and Hypoxic Cultures
The discriminant loading
spectrum of the positive ions displays specific peaks for normoxic
and hypoxic cultures (Figure 2A). The positive fraction represents the molecular profile
for normoxic cultures and shows that especially m/z 526.4, 773.5, 804.5, 832.5, and 848.5 are discriminative
for this condition. These peaks were identified with MS/MS as phosphatidylcholine
(PC) species 36:4, 38:4, and 38:4 (m/z 804.5, 832.5, and 848.5, respectively) and fragments of PC 38:4
(m/z 526.4) (Figure 2B). The negative fraction of the DF1 spectrum
represents the molecular profile for hypoxic cultures and shows m/z 542.5, 577.5, 666.5, 725.5, 782.5,
and 808.5 (Figure 2A). These peaks were identified with MS/MS as sphingomyelin (SM)
d18:1/16:0 (m/z 725.5), PC species
34:1 and 36:2 (m/z 782.5 and 808.5,
respectively), fragments of SM d18:1/16:0 (m/z 542.5 and 666.5), and a fragment of PC 34:1 (m/z 577.5) (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 Chondrocyte cell pellets cultured in hypoxia (2.5% O2) and normoxia (20% O2) were analyzed with MALDI-MSI
in
positive ion mode. The average spectra of all donors revealed a clear
spectral difference between the oxygen levels in the first discriminant
function (DF1) (A). Lipid assignments based on tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) identified changes in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin
(SM) content of the cell pellets (B). The MS/MS spectra defined the
fatty acid composition and position as the total of the two chains
(snx+y), the individual
fatty acids (snx_sny) or the individual fatty acids and their respective position
(sn1/sn2).

Phosphatidylglycerol Species Predominantly Present in Normoxic
Cultures
Complementary to the positive ion mode spectra,
negative ion mode spectra were acquired on adjacent sections. The
discriminant loading spectrum of the negative ions displays specific
peaks for normoxic and hypoxic cultures (Figure 3A). The positive fraction represents the
molecular profile for normoxic cultures and shows that especially m/z 599.3, 773.5, 795.5, 819.5, 841.5,
865.5, and 885.5 were more abundant in this condition. These peaks
were identified with MS/MS as phosphatidylinositol (PI) 38:4 (m/z 885.5), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) 36:2,
38:5, 40:7, 42:10, and 44:12 (m/z 773.5, 795.5, 819.5, 841.5, and 865.5, respectively), and a fragment
of PI 38:4 (m/z 599.3) (Figure 3B). The negative
fraction of the DF1 spectrum represents the molecular profile for
hypoxic cultures and shows that m/z 701.5, 722.5, 788.5, 835.5, 863.5, 887.5, and 913.5 were the most
prominent. MS/MS experiments (Figure 2B) identified PI 34:1, 36:1, 38:3, and 40:4 (m/z 835.5, 863.5, 887.5, and 913.5, respectively),
phosphatidylserine (PS) 36:1 (m/z 788.5), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) p36:4 (m/z 722.5), and a fragment of PS 36:1 (m/z 701.5).

Figure 3 Chondrocyte cell pellets cultured in hypoxia (2.5% O2) and normoxia (20% O2) were analyzed with MALDI-MSI
in
negative ion mode. The average spectra of all donors revealed a clear
spectral difference between the oxygen levels in DF1 (A). Lipid assignments
based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identified changes in the
phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylserine
(PS) content of the cell pellets (B). The MS/MS spectra defined the
fatty acid composition and position as the total of the two chains
(snx+y), the individual
fatty acids (snx_sny), or the individual fatty acids and their respective position
(sn1/sn2).

Phosphatidylglycerol Species Localized in Oxygen-Rich Areas
As described above, in the negative ion mode spectra PG peaks are,
based on their loadings, the most separating masses between oxygen
levels. Selected molecular images were reconstructed using BioMap
to verify if individual PG and PI species display signal intensity
differences between the oxygen levels. These molecular images show
that the individual PG masses, including m/z 773.5, 795.5, 819.5, 841.5, and 865.5, have a higher signal
intensity in pellets cultured in normoxia (Figure 4), which is in line with the LDA result.
The intensity of the PI at m/z 863.5
is not only greater in hypoxic cultures but also has a higher signal
in the center of normoxic pellets, where the oxygen level generally
is lower. The opposite is the case for the PG at m/z 841.5, which is less abundant in hypoxia and
in hypoxic regions (center) of normoxic pellets. This shows that normoxia
specifically elevates the amount of PG species.

Figure 4 Cartilage-specific extracellular
matrix production. After MALDI-MSI,
sections were stained with Alcian blue to detect cartilage-specific
extracellular matrix production. Arrows indicate clear positive staining.
Intensity images of individual PG and PI species show differences
between pellets cultured in hypoxia and normoxia. The intensity of
the PI at m/z 863.5 (bottom row)
is not only higher in hypoxic cultures but also has a higher intensity
in the center of normoxic pellets, where the oxygen level generally
is lower. The opposite can be seen for the PG at m/z 841.5, which is less abundant in hypoxic cultures
and in the hypoxic regions (center) of normoxic pellets.

Cardiolipin Species More Abundant in Normoxia
In eukaryotic
cells PG is mainly known for its role as precursor for cardiolipin
(CL). CL is a unique tetra-acyl phospholipid found in mitochondrial
membranes where it plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics,
membrane stability, and apoptosis.29−31 We analyzed the samples
with MALDI-MSI using a higher mass range (m/z 100–2000) to determine whether the elevated levels
of PG in normoxia result in altered CL composition. LDA revealed a
higher contribution of five CL species (m/z 1427.9, 1454.0, 1478.0, 1524.0, and 1538.1) in normoxia
and only one (m/z 1435.9) in hypoxia
(Figure 5). These findings
demonstrate that normoxia also results in more abundant CL species
compared to hypoxia.

Figure 5 Chondrocyte cell pellets cultured in normoxia (20% O2) and hypoxia (2.5% O2) were analyzed with MALDI-MSI
in
negative ion mode at m/z 100–2000.
(A, B) DF1 revealed a clear spectral difference between the oxygen
levels. (C) Enlarging the m/z 1420–1580
revealed more cardiolipin species in normoxia than hypoxia. Asterisked

Discussion
Lipids exhibit a wide variety of cellular functions, such as structural
support, energy storage, protein trafficking, and cell signaling.
The role of lipids in cartilage degenerative disease, such as OA,
has gained increasing attention over the years. During OA, the oxygen
levels within the joint are altered and oxygen levels have been shown
to modulate the lipid content of cells.10,32 We therefore
set out to study the effect of oxygen levels (hypoxic and normoxic
conditions) on the lipid composition of human chondrocytes by employing
a widely used in vitro pellet culture system. Using
MALDI-MSI and tandem MS, we located the spatial distribution and identified
many lipid molecules within the same tissue section from five human
donors. LDA showed that human chondrocyte pellets cultured in normoxia
and hypoxia have a clear lipid signature, especially in their anionic
lipid species.

For hypoxic cultures in positive ion mode, we
identified SM d18:1/16:0
as the most discriminative; the sodiated molecular ion (m/z 725.5) as well as two fragments (m/z 542.5 and 666.5) had a high contribution the
DF1–. SM belongs to the class of sphingolipids (SL), and these
lipids regulate many processes, including stress responses, proliferation
and differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence.33 SM 34:1 is the most abundant SM species in synovial fluid
and its level is elevated in OA and rheumatoid arthritis.19 Rocha et al. showed that SM
levels are decreased during chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs,
which could be explained by higher gene expression of SPHK1.18 In breast tumor xenografts SM d18:1/16:0 was
also more abundant in hypoxic than normoxic areas.34

In the negative ion mode we identified the anionic
lipid species
PI as more abundant in hypoxia and PG as more abundant in normoxia
(Figure 2). PI and
PG species are biosynthesized by the same central liponucleotide intermediate,
cytidine-diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), suggesting competing
synthesis. This assumption is corroborated by data obtained in lung
surfactant, where a switch in the PI and PG content is observed around
the time of birth. In fetal surfactant, PI levels are high while PG
is low; this ratio changes around term resulting in high PG and low
PI levels in adults.35 There is no consensus
on why this shift takes place and if and how it is controlled, but
it may be regulated in part by the exposure to oxygen. Altered gene
expression of the enzymes involved in the formation of PI and PG showed
no difference in their expression levels (data not shown), suggesting
that this difference occurs at the protein, lipid, or downstream enzyme
activity level.

It is unknown if PG has a direct function in
the mitochondria of
mammalian cells but, as the precursor of CL, may have an indirect
role. We found elevated CL species in normoxia compared to hypoxia
(Figure 4). CL is a
mitochondrial membrane stabilizing phospholipid and plays an important
role in mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptosis.29−31 Heywood and
Lee showed an increase in the mitochondrial mass in chondrocytes cultured
in 20% oxygen compared to 2% oxygen.36 The
accumulation of PG and CL species in chondrocytes in normoxia may
thus signify mitochondrial defects, which may explain why chondrocytes
perform poorly and lose their phenotype in normoxic conditions.

Another remarkable observation is the length of the acyl chains
of the identified PGs. The CL acyl chain length varies in composition
in various organs,37 but in general the
most abundant species is linoleic acid (18:2) followed by oleic acid
(18:1). The length of fatty acyl chains and their degree of (un)saturation
define the exact function of a phospholipid, and alterations have
been associated with disease. For instance, elevated levels of arachidonic
(ARA; 20:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) containing CL are
linked to cardiomyopathies.38 We found,
next to the dioleic PG (m/z 773.5),
ARA- and DHA-containing PGs (m/z 795.5, 819.5, 841.5, and 865.5). Additionally, the five CL species,
CL 70:4, 72:5, 74:7, 78:12, and 78:5 (m/z 1427.9, 1454.0, 1478.0, 1524.0, and 1538.1, respectively), that
are more abundant in normoxia contain unsaturated acyl chains whereas
the CL that is more present in hypoxia, CL 70:0 (m/z 1435.9), does not contain unsaturated acyl chains.
CL is, due to its high level of unsaturation and proximity to ROS
production, more prone to peroxidation than other phospholipid classes.
The configuration of the acyl chains in CL in healthy cartilage is
unknown. Additional studies are needed to determine the role of increased
ALA- and DHA-containing PG and CL species in chondrocytes.

The
intensity images of PG and PI show a clear location dependency
(Figure 4). These images
also show variation in intensities between triplicates that may be
explained by the location of the section with respect to the spherical
pellet, at the edge or more to the middle of the pellet. This implies
that the intensities of certain molecules may be used as a marker
for its original location within the 3D tissue section.

Future
studies will determine whether these lipid changes also
occur in OA affected cartilage in which the oxygen levels are altered
and thereby may be used as a marker for disease grade or even therapy.

Conclusion
In conclusion, using MALDI-MSI, we show that human chondrocytes
have a distinct, oxygen-dependent lipid profile. These specific lipid
profiles may be relevant for retaining the chondrogenic phenotype
which has important implications for the treatment of bone and cartilage
diseases.
