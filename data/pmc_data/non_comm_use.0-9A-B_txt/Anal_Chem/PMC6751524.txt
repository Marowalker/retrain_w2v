Quantitative
bottom-up shotgun lipidomics relies on molecular species-specific
“signature” fragments consistently detectable in tandem
mass spectra of analytes and standards. Molecular species of glycerophospholipids
are typically quantified using carboxylate fragments of their fatty
acid moieties produced by higher-energy collisional dissociation of
their molecular anions. However, employing standards whose fatty acids
moieties are similar, yet not identical, to the target lipids could
severely compromise their quantification. We developed a generic and
portable fragmentation model implemented in the open-source LipidXte
software that harmonizes the abundances of carboxylate anion fragments
originating from fatty acid moieties having different sn-1/2 positions
at the glycerol backbone, length of the hydrocarbon chain, and number
and location of double bonds. The postacquisition adjustment enables
unbiased absolute (molar) quantification of glycerophospholipid species
independent of instrument settings, collision energy, and employed
internal standards.

==== Body
The concept
of omics quantification differs from a classical
paradigm of small molecules
analysis that relies upon authentic internal standards whose chemical
structure is identical to target analytes (reviewed in refs 1 and 2). In a single analysis shotgun
lipidomics (reviewed in refs (3−6)) typically detects several hundred
species from more than 20 major lipid classes, whose molar abundance
can differ by more than 1000-fold.7−9 Individual lipids are
quantified using a few (or sometimes just one) internal standard(s)
per each class by presuming the same molar response for standards
and analytes. Because of the direct infusion of total lipid extracts
into a high-resolution mass spectrometer both standards and analytes
are ionized and detected together. This helps to equalize (but not
alleviate) matrix suppression and reduce (but not eliminate) quantification
bias. For example, more than 50 species of triacylglycerols (TAG)
having fatty acid moieties with 10–24 atoms of carbon and 0–6
double bonds were consistently quantified in human plasma by top-down
analysis using a single internal standard 50:0 d5 TAG.7,10

Top-down lipidomics detects and quantifies intact lipid molecules,
yet it does not reveal their molecular structure or distinguish isomeric
species. Higher molecular specificity of lipid quantification is achieved
by bottom-up analyses based on tandem mass spectrometry.11−13 Here lipids are quantified by considering the abundance of species-specific
“signature” fragments consistently detected in their
MSn spectra.14 For example, glycerophospholipid (GPL) species are typically quantified
using carboxylate anion (CA) fragments produced from their molecular
anions by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD).13,15 While the bottom-up identification of lipid species has become routine,11 their quantification requires semiempirical
adjustment of CA abundances for several structure-, instrument-, and
experiment-dependent factors.12,13,16 The quantification bias is most dramatic for GPL comprising polyunsaturated
fatty acid (PUFA) moieties.12 Upon HCD,
CA of PUFA readily release CO213,17,18 and also yield a large number of poorly
accountable low-abundant fragments. Therefore, the quantification
of unsaturated lipids using available, yet nonauthentic (typically,
saturated), lipid standards tends to underrepresent their true abundance.
To balance the response toward saturated and unsaturated GPL species
Ejsing et al. adjusted CA abundances for CO2-loss fragments.13 Yang et al. described a system of linear equations
with several semiempirical coefficients for compensating position-specific
biases of PUFA fragment intensities.16 However,
these and similar approaches are only applicable to a limited scope
of lipids analyzed under fixed experimental conditions. Lack of flexible
and comprehensive analytical routines severely compromises the interlaboratory
consistency of lipidomes quantification at the molecular species level.1,19,20

We developed, validated,
and tested a computational model and software
that harmonizes the abundance of CA fragments depending on their chemical
structure and employed collision energy. It enabled consistent and
accurate absolute (molar) quantification of structurally diverse GPL
species using nonauthentic internal standards at different mass spectrometers
and experimental conditions.

Experimental Section
Annotation
of lipid species followed common conventions.21 FA stands for fatty acids, PE for 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines, PC for 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines, and PC O- for 1-alkyl,2-acyl-glycero-3-phosphocholines.
For presentation clarity, for unsaturated FA we only specified the
position of the first double bond [e.g., FA 20:4 (5Z) for arachidonic
acid]. In acronyms of GPL species, fatty acid moieties at undefined
sn-1/-2 position are spaced by “–” (minus); spacing
with “/” (slash) indicates that their position is defined.
In this way, PC 16:0–18:1 represents a PC species having 16:0
and 18:1 moieties at an unspecified location; PC 16:0/18:1 stands
for the individual species with 16:0 and 18:1 moieties located at
the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively.

Lipid Standards and Common
Chemicals
Common lipid standards
and total PC extracts were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL). Common chemicals and solvents were of LC–MS or Chromasolv/LiChrosolv
grade purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). Chloroform
of HPLC grade was purchased from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, U.K.).

Synthesis of Lipids Standards
Standards that are not
commercially available were synthesized in house. The series of PC
O- standards were synthesized by acylating 1-O-hexadecyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL)] with free fatty acids [Larodan (Malmö, Sweden)] and fatty
acid chlorides [Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, CA)] in dry chloroform in the
presence of polymer-bound DMAP (Sigma-Aldrich). Reaction mixtures
were extracted with MTBE/methanol/water (10:3:3, v/v/v); the organic
phase was collected, diluted down to the concentration of 0.5 μM,
and subjected to HCD Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (FT
MS/MS).

PC 20:4 (5Z)/16:0 and PC 22:6 (4Z)/16:0 were synthesized
from glycerol-3-phosphocholine via 2-palmitoyl-sn-lysophosphatidylcholine (Figure S1).
They were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
and analyzed by 1H, 13C, and 31P
NMR. Ion mobility MS22 was employed to
establish their isomeric purity (Figure S2).

Acquisition and Processing of HCD Fragment Intensity Curves
Synthetic standards were diluted with 2-propanol/methanol/chloroform
(4:2:1 v/v/v) mixture containing 7.5 mM ammonium formate (further
termed MSmix) and infused into LTQ Orbitrap Velos or Q Exactive mass
spectrometers using a Triversa NanoMate nanoflow robotic ion source
(Advion BioSciences) or, where specified, an electrospray ionization
(ESI) probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific) such that total ion current
(TIC) varied within the range of ±10%. HCD FT MS/MS was performed
under the following settings (values for Q Exactive are in parentheses):
mass isolation window of 1.6 (0.8) Th; normalized collision energy
(NCE) ramped from 0% to 120% [10–70 with 2% (1%) increment];
acquisition started at m/z 100 (180);
target mass resolution Rm/z=200, 200 000 (140 000); automated
gain control (AGC) value, 2 × 104; S-lens rf value,
50%; capillary temperature, 200 °C (Figures S3–S5). Each precursor was fragmented four times; raw
files were converted to mzXML and processed by LipidXte software (see
below). Intensities of precursor and fragment peaks were normalized
to the value of TIC at NCE of 0–5% (10–15%), under which
precursor fragmentation was negligible. Details of the data preprocessing
routine are in Figures S6 and S7.

Quantitative
Bottom-Up Shotgun Lipidomics
Samples were
diluted with MSmix to a total lipid concentration below 2 μM
and analyzed by FT MS and HCD FT MS/MS in negative mode. FT MS spectra
were acquired in reduced profile mode within the range of m/z 400–1200 under AGC 3 ×
106; injection time of 1 s. HCD FT MS/MS were acquired
with Rm/z=200 of 140 000; AGC of 2 × 104; injection time
of 1 s; precursor isolation width of 1 Th; starting m/z of 180. Precalculated m/z of plausible PC precursors were compiled into an inclusion
list, and for each precursor tandem mass spectra were acquired under
NCE of 25%, 30%, 35%.

The acquired *.raw files were filtered
using the PeakStrainer software.23 Lipids
were identified, and abundances of correspondent precursor and fragment
ions reported by LipidXplorer14,24 software. The output
data files in *.csv format were further processed by LipidXte for
automated correction of the intensity of CA fragments and quantification
of individual molecular lipid species.

Stand-Alone and Web Versions
of LipidXte Software
LipidXte
creates a computational model by aligning fragment ions intensity
curves and corrects the abundances of CA fragments for quantifying
GPL molecular species. Stand-alone LipidXte is a Java-based program
that uses ReAdW and mzxml-parser package in jmzReader25 for generating fragment intensity curves and computing
correction factors for CA intensities. The web version of LipidXte
available at https://doi.org/21.11101/0000-0007-D64D-2 is a JavaScript-based
interface that processes *.raw files produced by data-independent
acquisition and whose size does not exceed 30 MB. While processing
spectra, it interacts with the LipidXplorer and PeakStrainer programs
installed at the same web server.

Results and Discussion
Rationale
and Experimental Basis of the Model
We aimed
to develop a computational model and software for bottom-up shotgun
quantification of molecular species of GPL that should lessen its
dependence on internal standards and experiment settings. The model
should adjust the abundance of CA fragments of fatty acid moieties
detected in HCD FT MS/MS spectra of molecular anions of GPL and equalize
the molar response independent of their chemical structure and collision
energy. We also presumed that, if adjusted correctly, molar concentrations
of lipids determined by top-down (FT MS) and, independently, bottom-up
(HCD FT MS/MS) analyses should match.

Although we eventually
aimed at quantifying a broad scope of lipid classes, we used phosphatidylcholines
(PC) to develop and validate the computational model. PC show a “classical”
fragmentation behavior, and many PC standards are commercially available
or could be chemically synthesized from available precursors. As a
resource for computational modeling, we used a collection of full
CA intensity curves (Figures S8–S10) acquired on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer for, in total, 148 standards
(including 26 PC and 39 PC O- species) by ramping NCE from 10% to
70%. To make curves comparable, their intensity was normalized to
the total ion current observed in the same experiment under low NCE
(Figure S7). Curves were remarkably reproducible
over a long (more than 900 days) period of time (Figure S11).

Importantly, curves acquired for the same
CA by fragmenting different
PC precursors were very similar and unaffected by complementary FA
moieties (Figure S12). At the same time,
they strongly differed from the curves acquired from [M – H]− molecular anions of free fatty acids that (unfortunately)
could not be used for lipid fragmentation modeling (Figures S13 and S14).

The alignment of normalized CA
curves acquired from a series of
structurally related PC O- species having 16:0 fatty alcohol at the
sn-1 and varying FA moieties at the sn-2 position suggested that the
length, unsaturation, and location of double bonds affected them in
different ways (Figure 1). The relative intensity of CA fragments increased with the length
and decreased with the number of double bonds in corresponding moieties.
The curves of all saturated CA maxed at the same NCE (ca. 30%), while
maxima of the curves of unsaturated CA were shifted toward lower NCE
depending on the number (Figure 1B) and position of double bonds (Figure 1C). It is also known that in diester PC CA
produced from sn-2 fatty acid moiety are more abundant than from sn-1.15,26

Figure 1 Intensity
curves of CA fragments acquired from molecular anions
[M + HCOO]− of a series of PC O- species having
different sn-2 fatty acids moieties (see insets). Curves grouping
highlights the impact of (A) hydrocarbon chain length, (B) unsaturation,
and (C) double bonds location.

We, therefore, concluded that, for harmonizing the abundances of
CA fragments, four major corrections accounting for the hydrocarbon
chain length, number and position of double bonds, and sn-1/2 location
of the FA moiety should be applied successively and independently.

Building and Testing the Computational Model
First,
we aligned the CA curves of three symmetric saturated PC 12:0/12:0;
PC 18:0/18:0, and PC 22:0/22:0 as a 3D plot in coordinates [m/z; relative intensity (normalized to
TIC); NCE] (Figure S15). Next, we used
second-order polynomial regression to connect the data points at each
curve having the same relative abundance (normalized to the curve
maximum) by monotonous convex lines. In turn, this mathematical representation
allowed us to project the relative intensity (normalized to TIC) for
any CA at any NCE and to compute individual mass-dependent adjustment
factors using CA 16:0 as an arbitrary reference (Figure S16). This adjustment was applied to curves of all
CA and (if detected) their CO2-loss fragments before other
corrections.

The relationship between the abundance and chemical
structure of CA fragment(s) does not lend itself to a simple mathematical
description using a few intuitive structure-related terms. Therefore,
we set out to experimentally define a single numeric measure for CA
fragmentation propensity. We termed it FI for fatty acid index and
defined FI = 0 for the fatty acid with the lowest (22:6) and FI =
1.0 with the highest (e.g., 16:0 or 18:0) relative intensity at the
maxima of their curves (Figure 1B). Next, we acquired CA curves from 39 PC O- species (Table S1) that differed by their sn-2 fatty acid
moiety. Curves were preprocessed, subjected to m/z-dependent correction as described above, and plotted in
coordinates [FI; relative intensity (normalized to TIC); NCE]. We
positioned individual curves along the FI axes such that their maxima
fit a monotonous convex line. We also requested that, upon scaling
along FI axes, the experimental and projected curves had the best
Pearson correlation. In this way, each FA moiety received its individual
FI index (full list of FI is in Table S1). Finally, we interpolated intermediate values by second-order polynomial
regression emulating a 3D shape.

Using CA curves acquired from
PC O- species alleviated the impact
of sn-1/2 positioning (all fatty acid moieties were at sn-2) and contributed
to the alignments consistency. Next, we asked if FI determined by
fragmenting PC O- species would be applicable to asymmetric and symmetric
diacyl PC having, respectively, different or identical fatty acid
moieties (Figure 2).
We produced and aligned CA curves from four symmetric PC [PC 18:0/18:0,
PC 22:0/22:0, PC 20:4 (5Z)/20:4 (5Z), PC 22:6 (4Z)/22:6 (4Z)] and
five asymmetric PC [PC 12:0/13:0, PC 16:0/20:4 (5Z), PC 16:0/22:6
(4Z), PC 20:4 (5Z)/16:0, PC 22:6 (4Z)/16:0] (Figures S17 and S18). We underscore that, for building the model, it
was critical to include a PC standard with the polyunsaturated moiety
at the sn-1 position that was synthesized in house.

its validation using symmetric PC. (A)
The 3D plot computed using CA curves of PC 16:0/16:0 (FI = 1), PC
20:4 (5Z)/20:4 (5Z) (FI = 0.35), and PC 22:6 (4Z)/22:6 (4Z) (FI =
0). The curves of PC 18:2/18:2 and PC 18:3 (9Z)/18:3 (9Z) were fitted
to the model using FI = 0.91 (for 18:2) and FI = 0.73 [for 18:3 (9Z)]
according to Table S1. Computed and experiment
curves are shown as normal and dashed lines, respectively (panels
B and C). Curves of CA 16:0 (FI = 1) and 20:4 (5Z) (FI = 0) are shown
as thin lines for reference. Shading of the curves indicates that
they are cross sections of the 3D-shape model at corresponding FI.

As expected, saturated CA were all having FI =
1.0, and there was
no difference in FI of isomers of monounsaturated FA (Table S1). Importantly, FI (but not intensities
at the maxima of the curve) showed no positional specificity and were
less than 2.5% different between CA from the ether- and diacyl-PC
(Table S2).

To test if this model
correctly predicted CA profiles, we acquired
CA curves from two symmetrical unsaturated PCs and compared the experimental
curves with curves computed for FI from Table S1. Within the working range of NCE of 25–35%, they
differed by less than 5% (Figure 2, parts B and C).

Altogether, we produced four
3D alignments suitable for subsequent
adjustment of CA fragment intensities: one for PC O- (fatty acid at
the sn-2 position) and three for diacyl PC: separately for the fatty
acids at sn-1 and sn-2 positions and symmetric PC. The same FI (Table S1) were assigned to corresponding CA fragments
in all models.

One remarkable observation was that source CA
curves, FI, and the
entire models were highly concordant between different mass spectrometers.
FI determined by HCD FT MS/MS on LTQ Orbitrap Velos and Q Exactive
instruments differed by less than 10% (Table S1). Taken together, our models harmonized the abundance of CA fragments
of common fatty acid moieties produced within a broad range of NCE
in the sn-position-specific manner.

Quantification of sn-1/sn-2
Position Isomers
We assumed
that each asymmetric GPL species could occur as a mixture of sn-1/2
isomers of varying molar ratio. We further reasoned that, permitting
the data quality, this ratio could be deduced from the actual intensities
of complementary CA fragments adjusted according to their FI and applied
NCE. The molar ratio of isomers was computed from the intensities
of CA peaks (see Figures S19 and S20 for
further details) according to the following equation:  where Ia and Ib are the intensities
of the two complementary
CA peaks; mol%a(sn-2) is the mol % of the isomer
having the fatty acid moiety “a” at the sn-2 position;
in this way  

We tested the accuracy of
isomers ratio
determination by analyzing mixtures of synthetic PC standards whose
isomeric purity was established by ion mobility mass spectrometry.22 We quantified the relative abundances in three
pairs of synthetic isomers, including PC with saturated and polyunsaturated
fatty acid moieties (Table S4).

Next,
we used a commercial porcine brain PC extract, in which the
isomeric composition of several PC species was previously determined
by two independent experiments using ion mobility mass spectrometry.22,27 We analyzed it by HCD FT MS/MS and applied our model to quantify
positional isomers now only using the adjusted relative abundances
of CA fragments (Table S4). Altogether,
we were able to dissect 39 positional isomers. Expectantly, PUFA moieties
(fatty acids with four or more double bonds) were found almost exclusively
at the sn-2 position, while the location of saturated and monounsaturated
moieties was promiscuous (Table S4 only
includes the species whose abundance exceeded 0.5 mol %). We note
that it was not always possible to quantify the isomers because of
interfering fragments or limited ion statistics, despite being able
to detect both complementary fatty acid moieties.

Improved Consistency
between Top-Down and Bottom-Up Quantification
We next tested
if adjusting the abundance of CA fragments resulted
in accurate and consistent quantification of lipid species. To this
end, we quantified a mixture of 23 PC standards (Table S3) by top-down (FT MS) and bottom-up (HCD FT MS/MS)
analysis using PC 12:0/13:0 as an internal standard. The abundance
of precursor and fragment ions was reported by LipidXplorer, and then
adjusted by LipidXte (Figure S25).

We observed poor consistency (R2 = 0.388)
between FT MS and uncorrected HCD FT MS/MS quantification at NCE =
30% (Figure 3A). Concentrations
of polyunsaturated species were strongly underrepresented in bottom-up
profiles because of profound (up to 80%) losses of CA fragments, while
adding up CO2-loss fragments did not restore the anticipated
abundances. At the same time, saturated species were overestimated
by more than 20%. Varying the collision energy did not improve the
quantification concordance (Figures S21 and S23; Table S5). At the same time, adjusting
CA abundances by LipidXte eliminated the quantification bias (R2 = 0.993) and reduced the spread of errors
down to ±10% at all applied collision energies.

Figure 3 Adjustment of abundances
of CA fragments improved the concordance
between top-down and bottom-up quantification. (A) Uncorrected intensities
of CA fragments at different NCE (inset) in MS/MS spectra of four
PC species (indicated below the bars). Lines above the bars indicate
the sum of intensities of sn-1 and sn-2 fragments; shaded parts of
the bars stand for intensities added by accounting for the products
of CO2 loss. Gray shaded bars indicate the intensities
of intact precursor peaks in the FT MS spectrum. (B) Correlation plot
of lipid standards quantified by FT MS and by HCD FT MS/MS. (C) The
intensities of the same CA peaks after LipidXte correction. (D) Correlation
plot after LipidXte correction.

Therefore, we concluded that automated adjustment of CA abundances
is required for consistent quantification of both saturated and polyunsaturated
molecular species.

The Model is Portable between Orbitrap Instruments
The fragmentation model used for calculating the adjustment factors
relied upon the alignment of CA curves acquired at the same Q Exactive
mass spectrometer. However, we noticed that FI were similar even if
CA curves were acquired by HCD FT MS/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Tables S1 and S2). We wondered if the computational
model could be also portable between several Q Exactive instruments
installed in different laboratories and operating under their own
optimized settings.

We found that CA curves acquired on five
instruments in five laboratories were having a similar shape, yet
we observed that their maxima were slightly shifted along the NCE
axes. Therefore, LipidXte offers an automated routine for adjusting
the basis model that only required a single analysis of a mixture
of two PC standards (PC 12:0/13:0 and PC 22:6/22:6) by FT MS and HCD
FT MS/MS (Figures S24 and S25).

By
adjusting the model, we achieved excellent concordance of top-down
and bottom-up quantification on four Q Exactive instruments (Figure 4). We analyzed a
mixture of 23 synthetic PC standards at NCE of 25%, 30%, and 35% and
computed FT MS versus FT MS/MS correlation plots (similar to Figure 3) for each instrument.
With no LipidXte correction, the concordance between top-down and
bottom-up estimates was poor with R2 values
within the range of 0.1–0.8. Upon LipidXte correction, R2 values were better than 0.9 for all PC and
NCE on all four mass spectrometers. For a yet unknown reason, we failed
to achieve an equally good correlation on one (out of, in total, five)
tested instruments. Therefore, we recommend performing the bottom-up/top-down
correlation test with a mixture of standards prior to the analysis
of real samples.

Figure 4 LipidXte improves the concordance between top-down and
bottom-up
quantification at four Q Exactive instruments in three laboratories.

blue) and without (in red) LipidXte adjustment. (B) Slope of the same
plots after LipidXte correction. Slopes of uncorrected plots differed
by more than 5-fold and, for presentation clarity, are not shown here
(see Figure S22 for the quantification
of sn-positional isomers). At the instrument no. 1 full data sets
were independently acquired twice, and both replicates are presented
here for the reference.

We concluded that our
fragmentation model is portable and achieves
concordant quantification if fine-tuned by LipidXte.

Bottom-Up Quantification
of Polyunsaturated Phosphatidylcholines
in Porcine Brain
We next applied LipidXplorer with LipidXte
to quantify PC in porcine brain extract that contains a sizable fraction
of polyunsaturated lipids (Figure 5). The extract was subjected to top-down analysis and
to bottom-up analyses under several NCE. Then, the top-down profile
was compared with the nonadjusted and with LipidXte-adjusted bottom-up
profiles (Figure 5A).
The adjustment almost doubled the number of quantifiable PC species
(Figure 5B) (for presentation
clarity, only lipids above 0.5 mol % are shown in Figure 5A) and practically eliminated
significant (up to 60%) bias of the abundance of PUFA lipids (Figure 5C). Qualitative and
quantitative underrepresentation of polyunsaturated lipids was the
major source of profiles discordance also in the analyses of total
extracts (Figure 5D).
However, it was compensated by LipidXte software. We, therefore, concluded
that consistent absolute bottom-up quantification of lipid species
can be achieved by a combination of appropriate analytical and computational
procedures.1,19,20

Conclusion and Perspectives
A common and persisting bottleneck for many omics sciences, including lipidomics, is the dramatic discrepancy between
a large number of detectable molecules and a much lower number of
authentic standards available for their quantification. Therefore,
accurate and precise lipidome-wide quantification should rely upon
a combination of expertly chosen experimental conditions and spectra
processing software that, together, should be harmonizing instrument
response toward similar, yet not identical, lipid molecules.

Here we demonstrate that the computational model based on the alignment
of full CA fragment intensity curves enables the unbiased quantification
of molecular species within a broad range of unsaturation, length,
and also different sn-1/2 positioning of their fatty acid moieties.
To our delight, the model was remarkably stable toward variable instrument-dependent
settings and was portable between different mass spectrometers. Further
work should extend the approach to other lipid classes, possibly including
those that do not produce CA fragments. It also looks promising to
combine our approach with complementary fragmentation methods, e.g.,
collision-induced dissociation (CID) in linear traps, chemical fragmentation,
e.g., ozone-induced dissociation (OzID),27,28 and Paterno–Buechi photochemical cleavage,29 UV 193 nm laser excitation,30,31 and also with
ion mobility separation (reviewed in ref (32)).

Eventually, the field should be able
to close the gap between “one
standard” and “one standard per analyte” quantification
and, eventually, deliver consistent absolute lipidome-wide quantification
that is particularly critical for molecular medicine and disease diagnostics.20
