We present an experimental study of coupling of isotachophoresis
(ITP) and affinity chromatography (AC) to effect rapid, selective
purification with high column utilization and high resolution. We
provide a detailed protocol for performing ITP-AC and describe the
design of a buffer system to perform sequence specific separation
of nucleic acids. We describe the synthesis and functionalization
of our affinity substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) porous polymer monolith (GMA-EDMA PPM).
This substrate allows easy immobilization of affinity probes, is nonsieving
(even to macromolecules), and exhibits negligible nonspecific binding.
We demonstrate ITP-AC with 25 nt, Cy5 labeled DNA target and a DNA
probe and study the spatiotemporal dynamics using epifluorescence
imaging. We make qualitative and quantitative comparisons between
these data and the model presented in the first part of this two-paper
series. We vary the target concentration from 1 pg μL–1 to 100 pg μL–1 and ITP velocity over the
range of 10–50 μm s–1, and thereby
explore over 4 orders of magnitude of scaled target amount. We observe
very good agreement between predictions and experimental data for
the spatiotemporal behavior of the coupled ITP and affinity process,
and for key figures of merit, including scaled capture length and
maximum capture efficiency. Lastly, we demonstrate that the resolution
of ITP-AC increases linearly with time and purify 25 nt target DNA
from 10 000-fold higher abundance background (contaminating)
genomic fish sperm DNA. We perform this capture from 200 μL
of sample in under 1 mm column length and within <10 min.

==== Body
Affinity
chromatography (AC)
is a popular chromatographic technique for specific purification and/or
analysis of enzymes, lectins, other proteins, and nucleic acids from
various samples.1−4 However, when sample components of interest are present in very
low concentrations, a substantial volume of sample must be processed
through the affinity substrate. Low target concentrations and high
concentrations of fouling or competing species also imply low target-probe
binding rates.5 These factors increase
the time of the affinity assay, and they can lead to poor substrate
utilization and/or poor purification yield, limiting applications
of AC. As we presented in Part 1, we propose to address these limitations
of AC by preconcentrating and purifying the target immediately prior
to and during affinity reaction using isotachophoresis (ITP).6

ITP has been used experimentally in conjunction
with affinity-type
assays in several applications. For example, Abelev et al. used ITP
with counterflow to transport sample compounds onto regions of immobilized
proteins on cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose membranes.7−13 Abelev et al. used the binding to detect the presence, and analyze
the properties, of antibodies,7−13 lectins,9,10,12 other proteins,7,8 and nucleic acids.11 However, in their
work, ITP was used only as a pump-free, reproducible transport mechanism,
and not to substantially preconcentrate the analytes with ITP and
demonstrably accelerate reactions.13 Garcia-Schwartz
et al. presented an approach combining ITP and an affinity reaction
to detect micro-RNA.14,15 They used ITP to accelerate hybridization
between a target species and a mobile fluorescent DNA probe in a microchannel.
This ITP zone was then transported into a channel section containing
cross-linked polyacrylamide gel functionalized with DNA complementary
to the fluorescent DNA probe. This method was used to remove signal
background (a negative enrichment strategy) and, thus, enhance sequence
specific quantitation and specificity.14,15 Recently (in
work published during preparation of this manuscript), Karsenty et
al. used ITP to accelerate a reaction of a DNA target to an immobilized
DNA probe on a short region of stationary magnetic beads.16 In this relatively simple demonstration, only
a small portion (<1%) of the target is captured uniformly by the
short (order of ITP peak width) bead region and detected. Recently,
Han et al.200 used ITP to improve sensitivity
and speed of DNA array hybridization, detecting twenty targets down
to 100 fM in 30 min, also with <1% capture efficiency. Despite
these related studies, we know of no use of ITP with affinity reactions
to capture and recover (i.e., purify) target molecules. We also know
of no demonstrations where most of the ITP-focused target is captured
and detected on an AC column.

In Part 1 of this two-paper series,
we described the principle
of coupling ITP preconcentration and AC purification to purify and/or
analyze all of the target focused in ITP.6 Relevant to the current experiments, we derived and discussed an
analytically solvable one-dimensional transport model for coupling
of ITP with a semi-infinite AC porous column with second-order reversible
reaction kinetics. Our model captured the spatiotemporal dynamics
of target-probe binding including the coupled effects of target distribution
width, distribution intensity, application velocity, forward and reverse
reaction constants, and probe concentration on necessary affinity
region length, assay time, and capture efficiency. Our formulation
collapses these six independent variables to three nondimensionalized
parameters: α, β, and Da. Parameters
α and Da represent the scaled target distribution
height and width, respectively, and β represents a scaled dissociation
constant. We will discuss trends predicted by our model below, as
these are relevant to the current comparisons between experimental
results and our model.

Here, we demonstrate experimentally ITP-enhanced
affinity capture
in 500-μm inner diameter glass capillary with a poly(glycidyl
methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) (GMA-EDMA)
porous polymer monolith (PPM) with pores on the order of 2 μm,
functionalized with cDNA probes. We employed GMA-EDMA as GMA epoxy
group allowed for easy immobilization of DNA probes. These 2-μm-diameter
pores allowed us to migrate target macromolecules (here DNA) without
target sieving, or exclusion effects from concentration polarization,
or Donnan exclusion. Lastly, we used GMA-EDMA because it is translucent
(enabling fluorescent detection of bound DNA), can be UV photopolymerized,
and is easily incorporated into microfluidic devices.

In this
paper, we first explain our choice of the affinity substrate,
GMA-EDMA PPM for ITP-AC. We then describe the synthesis of GMA-EDMA,
and its functionalization with DNA probes. Next, we describe our protocol
for our ITP-enhanced affinity study, as well as the choice of buffer
chemistry for ITP-AC of DNA. We chose a DNA target for this demonstration
of ITP-AC because nucleic acids are important clinical markers and
therapeutic agents,17−19 which often require rapid purification prior to analysis
or use.20−24 Next, we present an experimental validation of our model from Part
16 with experiments using a Cy5 labeled
25 nt synthetic DNA target and a synthetic DNA PPM immobilized probe.
Lastly, using our technique, we demonstrate high-resolution sequence-specific
purification of 25 nt target DNA from genomic fish sperm DNA, as an
example of extraction from a high abundance background (with a mass
10 000-fold greater than that of the target).

Experimental
Methods
Here, we describe our experimental setup and materials,
our choice
of affinity substrate, GMA-EDMA PPM, the synthesis of this PPM, and
functionalization of this PPM with cDNA. We also discuss ITP-AC protocol
and our choice of ITP-AC buffer chemistry.

Experimental Setup
Figure 1 summarizes
the major features of our experimental setup, including the power
supply, optical detection hardware, and the PPM affinity structure
integrated into a capillary and forming the affinity column. We performed
ITP-aided affinity chromatography experiments in Model 53432-728 micropipet
capillaries (501 μm inner diameter; borosilicate glass) (VWR,
Vasalia, CA) secured in a custom-built capillary setup, which interfaced
LE and TE reservoirs to the capillary (see Figure 1a and section SI 5 in the Supporting Information
(SI)). Using these capillaries allowed us to iterate through
PPM synthesis chemistries and DNA functionalization chemistries in
an easy and cost-effective manner. To apply current for ITP, we used
platinum wire electrodes (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
a Model 2410 high-voltage sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments, Cleveland,
OH) in galvanostatic mode.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of the experimental setup consisting
of a custom-built
capillary setup, a high-voltage power supply, and an epifluorescence
microscope with a CCD camera. The inset in the lower left is a bright-field
image of the GMA-EDMA PPM inside a borosilicate glass capillary with
an inner diameter of 500 μm. (b) SEM micrograph of our GMA-EDMA
substrate for probe immobilization. The PPM morphology consisted of
globules ∼1 μm in diameter, and these formed pores ∼2
μm in diameter, ensuring that the porous affinity region had
small hydrodynamic resistance and easily permitted ITP focusing and
transport without sieving effects.

We monitored our experiments and performed fluorescence measurements
of the PPM with an Olympus Model IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope
equipped with 4× (NA of 0.16) and 2× (NA of 0.08) objectives
(Olympus, Hauppauge, NY), filter cubes (Models XF110-2 and XF115-2,
Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT), and 627-nm red and 470-nm blue LEDs
(ThorLabs, Newton, NJ) for illumination. We captured images with a
12-bit, 2048 × 2048 pixel charge coupled device (CCD) camera
with 7.4 μm × 7.4 μm pixels (Photometrics CoolSNAP
K4) controlled with WinView software, (Roper Scientific, Trenton,
NJ). We post-processed the images with custom in-house scripts written
in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA).

Materials
Ethylene
dimethacrylate (EDMA, CAS No. 97-90-5),
glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, CAS No. 106-91-2), inhibitor removal media
(Product No. 311332; CAS No. 9003-70-7), azobis(isobutyronitrile)
(CAS No. 78-67-1), 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TSPM, CAS
No. 2530-85-0), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), acetone, and methanol
(MeOH, 99.93% purity) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. n-Hexane (HPLC grade, 95+% purity) was purchased from Alfa
Aesar. Saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer 20X was obtained from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA). Fish sperm DNA (CAS No. 100403-24-5) was obtained
from Amresco (Solon, OH). Synthetic oligos were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and the Protein and Nucleic Acid
(PAN) facility at Stanford University (Stanford, CA).

Porous Polymer
Monolith Synthesis and Functionalization
For our affinity
substrate, we chose GMA-EDMA PPM, since the epoxide
group on GMA is known to be highly reactive to primary amines on biopolymers
such as nucleic acids20,25 and proteins26−28 and other well-known
affinity ligands.3 We cross-linked GMA
with EDMA via a free-radical, UV-initiated polymerization in the presence
of MeOH and hexane as solvents, with AIBN as a photoinitiator.29 We then functionalized the PPM with DNA, via
epoxy-amine reaction between the GMA epoxy group and a primary amine
on the synthetic DNA probe. (See section SI 6
in the Supporting Information for details regarding the choice
of PPM chemistry, and protocols for PPM synthesis and functionalization.)

ITP-Aided Affinity Chromatography Protocol
The protocol
for our experiments is summarized in Figure 2, along with example experimental data. We began by filling the LE
reservoir and the capillary with integrated affinity column with the
LE buffer by applying a vacuum of 68 kPa to the TE reservoir. We then
mixed the sample containing the target with the TE buffer and placed
this in the TE reservoir (Figure 2a, Step 1).
We then applied a constant current, inducing ITP extraction, purification,
and focusing. We refer to this current as “run current”.
Under ITP transport, the LE ions in the capillary migrated toward
the LE reservoir, followed by the TE ions. The target ions (DNA) have
an electrophoretic mobility intermediate to our LE and TE ions, and
so overspeed neighboring TE ions and focus at the interface. The DNA
is quickly (within 15 min) concentrated to at least 100-fold at the
LE/TE interface, resulting in a sharp, Gaussian-like peak (Figure 2a, Step 2). The target DNA was labeled and visualized
with fluorescent Cy5 dye. To purify unlabeled DNA, the LE/TE interface
can be tracked noninvasively, for example, with species-altered fluorescence
imaging30 or via current monitoring.31 Any matrix and/or interference ions with electrophoretic
mobilities lower than that of the TE were separated from the target
(Figure 2a, Step 2). Prior to the target migrating
into the porous affinity region, we lowered the current to a value
we refer to as “capture current”. We thus employed two
magnitudes of current for our experiments, allowing us to independently
control the time to focus target and the rate of transport through
the affinity region. The concentrated target then migrated into the
porous affinity region, where it was captured by the immobilized probe
(Figure 2a, Step 2; Figure 2b). The LE/TE interface continued to migrate through the affinity
region and beyond. We ended the experiment once the LE/TE interface
migrated far enough from the capture region. To quickly terminate
the reverse (dissociation) reaction, we displaced the LE and TE buffers
entirely from the column with air (applying vacuum to the LE reservoir).
The drying-out of this column quickly disrupts any dissociation reactions,
enabling capture levels close to those of the focused ITP concentration.
To elute and harvest the captured target, we then introduced a finite
liquid slug (∼5 μL) of elution buffer into the capillary.
We used a syringe to drive this slug through the column and, thus,
elute the target (Figure 2a, Step 4). We removed
this eluted volume from the column and quickly quenched the alkaline
elution buffer (50 mM NaOH) with 200 mM HEPES to achieve near neutral
pH. In section SI 1 in the Supporting Information, we provide more details of our injection protocol, including an
estimate of the efficiency of target extraction from the TE reservoir.

Figure 2 (a) Schematic
illustrating our assay for ITP-aided affinity chromatography
in a porous polymer monolith column. We filled the LE reservoir and
affinity column with LE buffer (via vacuum at the TE reservoir), and
then introduce the sample and TE mixture into the TE reservoir (Step
1). We apply an electric field (from LE to TE) and the target species
are extracted and focused into a sharp ITP peak (Step 2). The target
migrates into the affinity region and is captured by the immobilized
probe (Step 3). After capture, we displace the LE and TE buffers with
air to arrest the desorption reaction. We then introduce a small (roughly
5 μL) slug of elution buffer to remove and collect the bound
target from the column (Step 4). (b) Spatiotemporal plot of experimentally
measured target concentration showing dynamics of a typical ITP-AC
binding experiment. The concentrated target (visualized with Cy5 fluorescence)
entered the porous affinity region from the left and was captured
by the immobilized probes. In this experiment, αDa = 1.0 × 10–1 and α = 1.3 × 10–1.

ITP-AC Choice of Buffer
Chemistry
We explored a significant
number of variations of our chemistry and here summarize our final
choice. The LE buffer consisted of 250 mM HCl and 500 mM Tris. The
TE buffer, as placed in the TE well, consisted of 25 mM HEPES, 50
mM Tris, and varying amounts of target and/or contaminating species.
We chose chloride and HEPES as the LE and TE ions, respectively, to
provide a good tradeoff between focusing the target DNA and excluding
contaminants. We chose Tris as a counterion to provide a pH of 8.2
for the hybridization reaction, as the hybridization of DNA occurs
readily around this pH.32,33 (See section SI 7 in the Supporting Information for more details
regarding our choices of buffer chemistry for ITP-AC.)

Results
and Discussion
First, we briefly review the results of our
model from Part 1 of
this two-part series6 and then present
a series of experiments that we used to study ITP-AC and validate
our model. In these experiments, we measured the target migration
in ITP and its subsequent hybridization reaction with the immobilized
probe. We varied the scaled total target amount, αDa, over 4 orders of magnitude by varying the target amount and ITP
velocity. We compared the spatiotemporal behavior of ITP-AC, capture
length, and capture efficiency to that predicted by our model that
was described in Part 1 of this two-part series.6 Lastly, we demonstrated purification of the 25 nt DNA target
from 10 000-fold more-abundant fish sperm DNA.

Brief Review
of ITP-AC Trends Predicted by Our Model
Here, we summarize
some insights from the model presented in Part
1 of our two-part series.6 These insights
guided our experimental efforts and are relevant to the experiment
versus prediction comparisons presented below. Briefly, our analysis
showed that the product αDa represents the
scaled total target amount and acts as a saturation parameter. For
αDa < 1, there is an insufficient amount
of target to locally saturate the affinity region. In this regime,
the dimensional capture length, pz, which is the physical distance required to capture 95% of
the target, is governed only by the balance of advection and reaction.
In this regime, pz = 2.8u/(k1N). For αDa >
1,
the affinity region becomes locally saturated, starting at the leading
edge. In this regime, the capture length is proportional to the total
target amount. For αDa ≤ 1 and Da < 0.1, the target distribution acts as a Dirac delta
distribution, relative to the affinity region. In this regime, the
capture time, pt, which
is the physical time required to capture 95% of the target, is determined
solely by the kinetics of the reaction; pt = 4.3/(k1N). For αDa ≤ 1 and Da > 1, the target distribution is relatively wide and the capture
time is governed by the time to advect the target into the affinity
region. In the latter regime, pt ≈ 5.4σ/u. We showed that, by
decreasing Da (e.g., as with ITP preconcentration),
we can reduce AC assay time and/or improve column utilization. Lastly,
we showed that the integration of ITP and AC separates the target
and contaminants into nondiffusing zones, so the resolution of ITP-AC
scales proportionally with time.

Measurement of ITP-AC Parameters
In the comparison
of model versus experiments, we strived to minimize the number of
assumed parameters and find global parameters that represented the
entire dataset (not just individual conditions). Our model requires
three parameters: α, β, and Da. To evaluate
these, we directly measured the values of u, pz, a, n, and N, so we make no assumptions regarding
these parameters. We measured u directly from spatiotemporal
data of target migration in free solution in front of the PPM. We
measured pz by integrating
the width-averaged measured fluorescence intensity, with respect to
the axial coordinate, to find the bounds containing 95% of the total
integrated intensity. We measured a and n by measuring fluorescence intensity in the spatiotemporal fluorescence
data and by interpolating within calibration curve for Cy5 fluorescence
vs DNA concentration (see section SI 2 in the
Supporting Information). Similarly, in separate experiments,
we measured N by measuring the fluorescence intensity
of Cy5 modified probe bound to the PPM and interpolating on a Cy5
fluorescence vs DNA concentration curve.

After measuring values
of u, pz, a, n, and N,
we had several choices of obtaining the values of Kd and k1.
We chose to demonstrate our assay using DNA target and capture probes
with high hybrid melting temperature, so the reactions in our experiments
are strongly irreversible. This made the model predictions very weak
functions of Kd. We chose
to estimate and fix the value of Kd and then vary k1 as the sole “free”
parameter. We estimated Kd based on published experimental measurements of Kd for similar oligonucleotide lengths
and similar ionic strengths (see section SI 3
in the Supporting Information). For all of our experiments, Kd ≈ 10–11 M and β ≈ 3 × 10–7. This β
value is much lower than a β value for which any decrease of
capture efficiency or streaking could be expected from the target-affinity
probe dissociation (see the section entitled “Control of Capture
Efficiency (n/N)” in Part
1 of this two-paper series6). From our
model-versus-experiment comparisons, we obtained a value for k1 of 1.5 × 103 M–1 s–1, and this provided the best global fit to
all 18 experiments in our dataset (spanning six experimental conditions).
This value for the on-rate constant is consistent with that observed
by, for example, Gao et al. for surface hybridization of DNA with
some secondary structure.34 For example,
Gao et al. obtained forward rate constants ranging from 3 × 103 M–1 s–1 for probes and
targets with some secondary structure to 5 × 104 M–1 s–1 for probes and targets with
little secondary structure for 25 nt probes and targets.34 (See section SI 3 in the
Supporting Information for the predicted secondary structure
of our target and probe. See section SI 9 in the
Supporting Information for additional discussion and recommendations
for practical ITP-AC parameters.)

Spatiotemporal Behavior
of ITP-AC
We observed and quantified
the spatiotemporal behavior of ITP-AC by tracking the target while
it was migrating in ITP in free solution and while it was reacting
with the immobilized probe in PPM. In Figure 2b, we show a spatiotemporal plot of the target entering the PPM from
free solution and reacting with the immobilized probe in the PPM.
We plot the averaged Cy5 fluorescence intensity, based on the channel
cross-sectional area, as a function of distance along the axial coordinate
and time.

In this experiment, we spiked 10 nM target DNA into
the TE and performed ITP in galvanostatic mode with a run current
of 800 μA and a capture current of 200 μA. Both the ITP
velocity and the electro-osmotic flow velocity are proportional to
the current. For this system, the electro-osmotic flow is in the direction
opposite of the LE/TE interface migration and therefore decreases
the ITP velocity. The electric field in the LE/TE interface is also
proportional to the current in the system. This electric field counteracts
target dispersion, and, therefore, the target distribution width in
this regime is inversely proportional to the current in the system.35−38 Therefore, as in typical ITP dynamics, the capture current simultaneously
controlled the net target velocity and the target distribution width.
This combination of target concentration and capture current resulted
in values of α = 1.3 × 10–1 and αDa = 1.0 × 10–1.

The target
focused in ITP migrated at constant velocity in a Gaussian-like
distribution toward the PPM (Figure 2b). As
we described in the section entitled “ITP-Aided
Affinity Chromatography Protocol”, we performed ITP-AC
experiments with semi-infinite injection, meaning that a small amount
of target continuously streamed through the TE into the Gaussian peak.
As we observe in Figure 2b, the concentration
of target in the TE is negligibly small. Hence, we approximate the
initial target distribution (the distribution just before the target
enters the PPM) as a perfectly Gaussian distribution, as occurs with
finite injection ITP (and as assumed by our model).

Upon reaching
the monolith, the target immediately began to bind
with the affinity probe, penetrating ∼2.8 advection-reaction
length scales into the affinity region (see Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2b, there is
an increase in fluorescence intensity (by a factor of ∼1.7)
when the target enters the PPM. This effect was observed both with
ITP and without ITP in our PPMs. It was also observed with and without
immobilized probes (see section SI 2 in the Supporting
Information). Such observations lead us to attribute this to
the refractive optical properties of the PPM, and we corrected for
this when measuring a, n, and N.

Comparison between Predicted and Measured
Spatiotemporal Behavior
of ITP-AC
In Figure 3, we compare
the spatiotemporal behavior of three ITP-AC experiments (bottom row)
with that predicted by theory (top row) from Part 1 of this two-part
series.6 We plot the logarithm of the averaged
fluorescence intensity, based on the channel cross-sectional area,
as a function of distance along the axial coordinate inside the PPM
and time. To predict the spatiotemporal plots, we neglected the effects
of photobleaching and assumed a proportional relationship between
the fluorescence intensity of Cy5 and target concentration. For experiments
shown in Figures 3d, 3e, and 3f, we spiked 10000, 100, and 100 pM
target DNA into the TE, respectively. We performed ITP in galvanostatic
mode with a run current of 800 μA and capture currents of 200,
200, and 600 μA, respectively. These combinations of target
concentrations and capture currents resulted in the following αDa and α values: αDa = 1.0
× 10–1 and α = 1.3 × 10–1 for a target concentration of 10000 pM and a capture current of
200 μA; αDa = 4.3 × 10–4 and α = 1.1 × 10–3 for a target concentration
of 100 pM and a capture current of 200 μA; and αDa = 1.7 × 10–4 and α = 9.2
× 10–4 for a target concentration of 100 pM
and a capture current of 600 μA. We chose to operate at αDa < 1, so that the affinity region would not be locally
saturated (see the section entitled “Brief
Review of ITP-AC Trends Predicted by Our Model” in this
work). For experiments shown in Figures 3d, 3e, and 3f, as well as those
in Figure 5 (shown later in this paper), Da was on the order of 1, and the ITP preconcentration was
on the order of 100-fold. We chose not to preconcentrate further,
since doing so would not significantly decrease pt* and, therefore, would not improve
assay time or column utilization (see the section entitled “Control
of Capture Time pt” in Part 1 of
this two-paper series6).

Figure 3 (a, b, c) Predicted and
(d, e, f) measured spatiotemporal behavior
fluorescently labeled DNA target in ITP-AC inside the affinity region.
The spatiotemporal plots show the logarithm of the averaged fluorescence
intensity of the target, based on the cross-sectional area, as a function
of the axial coordinate (z) and time. Location z = 0 is located at the leading edge of the PPM affinity
region (see Figure 2a). Panels a, b, and c
show theoretically predicted captured target distributions for αDa = 1.0 × 10–1 and α = 1.3
× 10–1, αDa = 4.3 ×
10–4 and α = 1.1 × 10–3, and αDa = 1.7 × 10–4 and α = 9.2 × 10–4, respectively. Panels
d, e, and f show experimentally observed captured target distribution
for the same respective αDa and α values.
The predicted spatiotemporal distribution of the target agreed well
with that experimentally observed.

Overall, our model showed very good qualitative agreement
with
the experiments for over 3 orders of magnitude of target concentration.
Both the predicted shape and the relative magnitude of J-shaped contours
for the bound target concentration agreed well with that experimentally
observed. For example, in the experiment shown in Figure 3d, the target concentration was larger than that
shown in Figures 3e and 3f, so the captured target fluorescence intensity (proportional to n/N) was markedly larger than that shown
in Figures 3e and 3f.
In the experiment shown in Figure 3f, the capture
current was larger than that shown in Figures 3d and 3e, and this resulted in a larger target
velocity and, thus, deeper penetration into the PPM than in experiments
shown in Figures 3d and 3e. For all three experiments, upon penetrating ∼2.8 advection-reaction
length scales into the affinity region, a steady state was reached
and the target persisted on the PPM, as expected.

Our model
also showed good quantitative agreement with our experiments.
For example, for the experiment of Figure 3d, pz = 0.93 mm, and
max(n/N) = 7.2 × 10–2. For the corresponding theoretical prediction shown in Figure 3a, pz = 1.03 mm, and max(n/N) = 8.3
× 10–2, which is within 11% and 15%, respectively,
of the experimentally measured values. For the experiment of Figure 3e, pz = 0.91 mm, and max(n/N) = 5.8
× 10–4; whereas, for the corresponding prediction
shown in Figure 3b, values of pz = 0.97 mm, and max(n/N) = 3.9 × 10–4 were observed
(within 7% and 33% of the measured values, respectively). Lastly,
for the experiment of Figure 3f, pz = 2.8 mm and max(n/N) = 2.7 × 10–4; and the
corresponding theoretical prediction shown in Figure 3c is pz = 2.5
mm, and max(n/N) = 1.6 × 10–4, which are within 11% and 41%, respectively, of experimentally
measured values.

We attribute slight distortions in the J-shaped
profiles in Figures 3d and 3e to small amounts
of impurity present with the target that were not captured by the
affinity probes. We attribute the difference in early time slopes
of the contours of Figures 3c and 3f to a difference in target velocity between our
model and the experiment. Our model assumes a constant velocity of
the target, resulting in linear low-angle contours at early times
of t in Figure 3c. In our
experiments, we observed that the target slowed down, which is reflected
in the fluorescence slope of Figure 3f. One
possible cause for this is the interactions of the target with the
immobilized probes.

We attribute the small discrepancies in pz and max(n/N) between theoretical predictions (Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c) and
experimental observations (Figures 3d, 3e, and 3f) to small inhomogeneities
in the PPM, resulting in slightly nonhomogeneous immobilized probe
distribution. We hypothesize that this inhomogeneity was caused by
air trapped in some of the pores. This air was likely trapped with
a slightly different, random, distribution for each experiment. This
trapped air blocked access to the immobilized probes, causing effective
inhomogeneity in probe distribution. This hypothesis is supported
by our observations that the PPM material was somewhat hydrophilic,
and thus trapped the less-wetting phase (air) inside the pores.

Effect of α and Da on the Scaled Capture
Length
To validate our predictions for scaled capture length
(pz*), we measured pz for 18 ITP-AC experiments
(6 experimental conditions), varying the αDa values from 10–4 to 10–1. We
varied αDa by varying both the target concentration
in the TE well (100 pM to 10 nM) and the capture current (200 μA
to 600 μA). We stayed within a regime of αDa < 1 in our experiments, so that the affinity capture region would
not be locally saturated. To calculate pz*, we obtained u, pz, N, and k1, as described in the section entitled “Measurement of ITP-AC Parameters”. We plot
the measured pz* and
the theoretically predicted pz* curves, as a function of αDa in Figure 4a.

Figure 4 Predicted and experimentally observed (a) scaled capture
length
and (b) maximum capture efficiency, each as a function of the total
scaled target amount (αDa). CS is the target concentration in the TE, and Icap is the capture current in the ITP-AC experiment. The
scaled capture length is invariant of αDa for
αDa < 1 and equals ∼2.8. For αDa > 1, the affinity region is locally saturated and
scaled
capture length increases linearly with αDa.
The maximum capture efficiency increases linearly with αDa for αDa < 1. For αDa > 1, the affinity region is locally saturated and
max(n/N) approaches unity.

Figure 4a shows a successful collapse of
our pz* data over 4 orders
of magnitude of αDa (from 10–4 to 10–1). This confirms our prediction that pz* is approximately constant
for this most relevant range of αDa. We attribute
small column-to-column variations in pz* to small, irreproducible inhomogeneities in the
PPM.

Effect of α and Da on Capture Efficiency
We validated our theoretical predictions for maximum capture efficiency
max(n/N) with measurements of max(n/N) for 18 ITP-AC experiments varying
αDa from 10–4 to 10–1, as with the section entitled “Effect
of α and Da on the Scaled Capture Length” in this paper. We again maintained αDa < 1, so that the affinity capture region would not be saturated.
As Peterson et al. showed, local saturation of an affinity region
with high DNA probe density is not always experimentally possible,
because of electrostatic repulsion of DNA.39

To obtain max(n/N), we measured
max(n) from the spatiotemporal data and N from separate calibration experiments (see the section entitled
“Measurement of ITP-AC Parameters” in this work). First, we measured the maximum fluorescence
intensity of a bound target after a steady state was reached (i.e.,
the distribution of target was not changing). We then obtained max(n) by interpolating the fluorescence intensity on a Cy5
fluorescence intensity vs DNA concentration calibration curve (see section SI 2 in the Supporting Information).
We plot the measured max(n/N) and
the theoretically predicted max(n/N) as a function of αDa in Figure 4b.

We observed that the measured values of
max(n/N) indicate changes in the
value of αDa of more than 4 orders of magnitude
and, across all our conditions,
successfully collapses the data to a single linear relationship. This
agrees very well with the theoretically predicted trend. We attribute
the random variations in max(n/N) to experiment-to-experiment variations in inhomogeneity of N due to trapping of air in the PPM.

Sequence Specific Extraction
of the Target from a 104× More-Abundant Contaminant
Finally, as a demonstration
of ITP-AC, we performed separations of Cy5 labeled 25 nt oligo DNA
from 10 000-fold more-abundant genomic fish sperm DNA. For
these experiments, we placed into the TE reservoir 0.1 μg mL–1 of Cy5 labeled target DNA (total 0.02 μg) and
1000 μg mL–1 fish sperm DNA (total 200 μg).
We included 0.1× SYBR Green I in the mixture, to aid visualization
of the total nucleic acids. We performed ITP in galvanostatic mode
with a run current of 800 μA and a capture current of 200 μA.
We visualized this experiment independently in the SYBR Green I optical
channel (visualizing the very-high-abundance fish sperm DNA) and in
the Cy5 optical channel (visualizing only the target). Lastly, we
performed electrophoresis analysis of the eluate, providing an independent
verification of the purification (see section
SI 8 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 summarizes our demonstration
of selective capture. Figure 5a shows the spatiotemporal
plot of observed fluorescence from the experiment in the SYBR Green
I channel. The fish sperm DNA migrated in ITP from free solution into
the PPM and continued to migrate in ITP. This shows that background
DNA was not captured by the immobilized probe of the PPM, showing
little nonspecific binding of DNA to the GMA-EDMA PPM. We attribute
the slight decrease in ITP velocity of fish sperm DNA to the effects
of EOF on ITP.

Figure 5 Spatiotemporal plots showing separation of rare target
DNA from
10 000-fold more-abundant contaminating DNA using ITP-AC. The
plots show the target and contaminant migrating from free solution
into the porous polymer. SYBR Green I mostly visualized the highly
abundant background contaminant fish sperm DNA and Cy 5 visualized
the 25 nt target. (a) Separation observed in the SYBR Green I optical
channel showing the migration of fish sperm DNA; fish sperm DNA was
not captured by the immobilized probe on the PPM and continued to
migrate in ITP (this indicates that there was little nonspecific binding
of DNA to PPM). (b) Separation observed in the Cy5 optical channel
(the Cy5-labeled, low-abundance target DNA was quickly and selectively
captured). (c) Separation observed in overlapped SYBR Green I and
Cy5 channels shows separation between the trace target DNA and the
10 000-fold more-abundant contaminating fish sperm DNA.

In Figure 5b, we show the spatiotemporal
plot of observed fluorescence from the experiment in the Cy5 channel.
The Cy5-labeled target migrated in ITP from free solution into the
PPM and was quickly captured by the immobilized probe on the PPM.
The presence of 10 000-fold more-abundant contaminating DNA
did not interfere with capture of the target. We attribute the decrease
in Cy5 fluorescence over time (which becomes prominent in Figure 5b after 1000 s) to photobleaching of Cy5.

In Figure 5c, we show the spatiotemporal
plot of observed fluorescence from the experiment in both the SYBR
Green I and Cy5 channels. Figure 5c clearly
shows how target species attain zero velocity in a time of pt, while the contaminant species
(fish sperm DNA) continues to migrate at ITP velocity. This allows
for superior separation, as the target and contaminant are spatially
confined to two distinct, nondiffusing regions.6 The resolution of ITP-AC increases proportionally to time.
For this experiment, μL in LE ≈
−60 × 10–9 m2V–1s–1, μT in LE ≈
−20 × 10–9 m2 V–1 s–1, k1 = 103 M–1 s–1, N ≈
30 μM, and pz* ≈ 2.8. Hence, u95, the target
velocity needed to achieve 95% maximum resolution with ITP-AC was
∼0.01 mm s–1 (see the Supporting
Information of Part 1 of this two-part series6 for a discussion of u95). In this experiment,
the target velocity was ∼0.05 mm/s; therefore, we achieved
>95% of the maximum resolution. In this experiment, we separated
the
target from fish sperm DNA in a length of PPM of <1 mm and within
<10 min.

Conclusions
We presented an experimental
demonstration of ITP-AC with Cy5 labeled
synthetic DNA target and synthetic DNA probe immobilized onto an ∼2-μm-pore-diameter
porous polymer monolith (PPM) inside a 500-μm glass capillary.
We provided detailed protocol for ITP-AC and discussed the choice
of buffers to perform sequence-specific separation of nucleic acids.
We described our choice of the porous polymer monolith affinity substrate,
poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate).
This substrate was nonsieving and exhibited no nonspecific binding.
Therefore, it allowed for specific separation of large macromolecules.
We described the synthesis of GMA-EDMA PPM and the functionalization
of the PPM with DNA probes.

We performed ITP-AC experiments
with 25 nt DNA target and compared
these with our model presented in the first part of this two-paper
series.6 For these experiments, we used
epifluorescence imaging to track the Cy5 labeled target as it traveled
and reacted within the affinity region. The predicted spatiotemporal
dynamics of ITP-AC agreed very well with that measured experimentally.
By varying target concentration and ITP velocity, we explored capture
length and capture efficiency for over 4 orders of magnitude of scaled
target amount αDa (from 10–4 to 10–1). The predicted scaled capture length
and maximum capture efficiency agreed very well with experimentally
measured values for the entire range explored. Lastly, using our technique,
we demonstrated sequence-specific purification of 25 nt target DNA
from 200 μL of sample and demonstrated that the resolution in
ITP-AC increases linearly with time. In this experiment, we successfully
purified 25 nt target DNA from 10 000-fold more-abundant background
(contaminating) genomic fish sperm DNA in a column length of <1
mm and within <500 s.
