The combination of high-resolution LC–MS-based
untargeted
metabolomics with stable isotope tracing provides a global overview
of the cellular fate of precursor metabolites. This methodology enables
detection of putative metabolites from biological samples and simultaneous
quantification of the pattern and extent of isotope labeling. Labeling
of Trypanosoma brucei cell cultures with 50% uniformly 13C-labeled glucose demonstrated incorporation of glucose-derived
carbon into 187 of 588 putatively identified metabolites in diverse
pathways including carbohydrate, nucleotide, lipid, and amino acid
metabolism. Labeling patterns confirmed the metabolic pathways responsible
for the biosynthesis of many detected metabolites, and labeling was
detected in unexpected metabolites, including two higher sugar phosphates
annotated as octulose phosphate and nonulose phosphate. This untargeted
approach to stable isotope tracing facilitates the biochemical analysis
of known pathways and yields rapid identification of previously unexplored
areas of metabolism.

==== Body
Recent advances in metabolomics
technologies have enabled the analysis of metabolism on a global scale,
allowing detection and semiquantification of hundreds of low molecular
weight (<1000 Da) molecules in a single experiment.1,2 However, interpretation of these results remains dependent on our
knowledge of active metabolic pathways, which is far from complete
for many organisms.2−4 The ab initio identification of
novel pathways remains a challenge. Stable isotope tracing is an established
technique for determining the fate of individual metabolites, but
it generally requires targeted analysis of predicted products.5,6 The common technology that underlies both stable isotope tracing
and metabolomics (i.e., mass spectrometry) provides the opportunity
to combine these two approaches, allowing network-wide investigation
of metabolic pathways.

High-resolution mass spectrometry offers
great potential for untargeted
metabolomics, as high mass accuracy often (but not always) allows
direct formula assignment for each detected mass (m/z).1,2,7,8 The complexity of liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) data and the existence of many isobaric
metabolites hinders unambiguous identification of all metabolite peaks,
but recent advances in data processing allow automated identification
and annotation of many metabolites with improved confidence.9,10

A remaining limitation regarding biological interpretation
of metabolomics
data is the dependence on predetermined metabolic pathways, often
overlooking the potential involvement of novel pathways. Even in well-defined
organisms, detected metabolites may not derive from the classical
pathways, as metabolites may be imported from an exogenous source,
produced biosynthetically by one or more pathways, or derived from
different sources in different compartments within the same cell.
For example, in our model organism Trypanosoma brucei, inositol can be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus for glycosylphosphatidylinositol
anchor synthesis or imported for use in bulk inositol lipid synthesis.11

The placement of metabolites in pathways
is significantly improved
by stable isotope tracing, which has recently elucidated some important
descriptions of central metabolism.6,12−14 For example, labeling patterns of aspartate and tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle intermediates in human lung cancer cells revealed anaplerosis
via activation of pyruvate carboxylase,15 while in yeast a novel riboneogenesis pathway was confirmed by metabolite
labeling.4 The major limitation with current
isotope tracing approaches is the reliance on targeted analysis of
labeled metabolites, making it impossible to trace precursor distribution
into unexpected areas of metabolism. Nonetheless, these studies have
already demonstrated that our classical view of metabolism in many
organisms is overly simplistic, making an expansion of this approach
beyond central metabolism highly desirable. An untargeted isotope
tracing approach can be expected to reveal novel areas of metabolic
networks that are essential to include in systems-based studies of
metabolism.

Stable isotopes are becoming more commonly used
in untargeted metabolomics
studies to facilitate the quantification and identification of metabolites.
Isotope labeled metabolite extracts can assist with an elemental formula
assignment16,17 or can provide internal standards for quantitative
LC–MS-based metabolomics by isotope dilution.17 Fully labeled extracts have also been applied to the differentiation
of biogenic and exogenous features in LC–MS data.18,19 Stable isotopes have been applied to targeted metabolomic studies
for stable isotope tracing and, in combination with quantification,
for flux analysis.5,12,20 Expansion of these studies to the whole metabolic network requires
accurate and efficient measurement of stable isotope distributions
for all metabolites. Untargeted detection of isotopomer distributions
has been demonstrated for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS); however, interpretation is difficult for unknown metabolites
if they are not represented in spectral libraries.21,22 Here we introduce a method that uses high-resolution LC–MS
to perform untargeted detection of isotopic patterns for stable isotope
labeled metabolites in complex mixtures and thus enables identification
of novel metabolic pathways without preconception of the fate of labeled
precursors.

Experimental Section
Parasite Culture, Metabolite Extraction and Sample Analysis
Labeling of cellular metabolites was achieved by growth of the
procyclic-form Trypanosoma brucei under standard
cell culture conditions in SDM-79 medium,23 with 10 mM additional uniformly 13C-labeled glucose (∼50%
of total glucose labeled), for 5 days (10 doublings) to achieve close
to steady-state labeling. A parallel culture was prepared under identical
conditions, except with 10 mM additional unlabeled glucose to allow
identification of unlabeled metabolites. A total of 108 parasites were quenched by rapid cooling to 0 °C,13 growth medium was removed after centrifugation,
and metabolites extracted with a monophasic chloroform/methanol/water
(1:3:1) mixture, which extracts both polar and nonpolar metabolite
species, as previously described.24 LC–MS
analysis was performed with ZIC-HILIC hydrophilic interaction liquid
chromatography (Merck Sequant), coupled to high-resolution Exactive
Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Thermo, Hemel Hempstead, U.K.) operating
in both positive and negative ionization modes, according to our published
method.24 Samples were analyzed in triplicate.

Metabolomics Data Processing
Initial data processing
of raw LC–MS data (mzXML format) was performed using the standard
IDEOM (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.php) workflow
as described previously.9 This workflow
utilizes the XCMS Centwave algorithm for peak detection25 and mzMatch.R for alignment of samples, filtering,
and metadata storage in peakML files.26 Only metabolites detected in the unlabeled cell extracts were retained
for further analysis. Parameters used for noise filtering and (putative)
metabolite identification are available in Supplementary Table 1 in
the Supporting Information.

Detection of Stable Isotope-Labeled Metabolites
The
peakML file after filtering and identification was scanned for labeled
metabolites using the IDEOM Isotope Search and the PeakML.Isotope.UntargettedIsotope
function of mzMatch-ISO (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/isotopes-targetted.php). The algorithm for detection of isotope labeling begins by first
determining the number of possible labeled isotopomers a metabolite
can have, according to its molecular formula or mass (e.g., C3H6O3 could have 1, 2, or 3 carbons labeled).
Then the expected mass of each labeled isotopomer is calculated based
on the known mass difference between the light and heavy isotopes.
Peaks are assigned as isotopomers if their mass is within 4 ppm (the
mass accuracy of the spectrometer) of the predicted mass and within
a retention time window of ±0.2 min (the average peak width)
from the unlabeled peak, as isotopomers are expected to co-elute.
This procedure is repeated for every possible isotopomer of each putatively
annotated (unlabeled) metabolite to provide a comprehensive list of
relative isotopomer intensities for each metabolite. If necessary,
isotopomer signals that are missed in the initial processing, e.g.,
because of low intensities or irregular peak shapes, are gap-filled
from raw data in a targeted manner by mzMatch-ISO. The accuracy and
precision of the approach were validated by analysis of the natural 13C isotope (M + 1.0033) in 60 identified metabolites in the
unlabeled samples (n = 3). The measured relative
isotope abundance was 1.1% ± 1.3% lower than the theoretical
isotope abundance (mean ± standard deviation for 60 metabolites),
and the average standard deviation of experimental isotope abundances
was 0.4% (range 0.005–1.8%).

Data are either visualized
in IDEOM within Excel, showing the relative intensity of labeled isotopomers
(see Supplementary File 1 (Excel spreadsheet) in the Supporting Information), or in mzMatch-ISO-generated PDF files
containing detailed results for each metabolite. These results include
raw chromatograms representing the monoisotopic and corresponding
isotopic peaks; a normalized plot showing the variability in labeling
between replicates; a trend plot of the pattern of labeling in each
sample group; and a plot quantifying the absolute labeling pattern
of a selected isotopomer of interest (see Supplementary File 2 (pdf
file) in the Supporting Information). Both
of these data outputs were collated to generate a comprehensive list
of labeled metabolites. The procedure can be applied to 13C, 15N, 2H, or 18O isotope labels
or user-defined mass differences, e.g., for chemical tags.27

Results and Discussion
The method requires growth of
the organism of interest in the presence
of a predefined proportion (ideally 50%) of a stable isotope labeled
nutrient. In our proof-of-concept example, we used procyclic-form Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite responsible for
African sleeping sickness, which due to its reduced and well studied
metabolism is a suitable model organism for validating our approach.8 Growth medium containing 50% uniformly 13C-labeled glucose as the main carbon source was used to generate
steady-state labeling of the cellular metabolome. A parallel culture
was incubated with unlabeled glucose at the same concentration. Quenching
and metabolite extraction was achieved by a nonspecific metabolite
extraction protocol, and LC–MS analysis utilized zwitterionic
hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) coupled
to high-resolution mass spectrometry using Orbitrap technology.24 Data were analyzed using a combination of freely
available software, XCMS,28 mzmatch.R,26 and IDEOM,9 with
customized additions to detect and quantify isotopomer signals.

In our example, over 27,000 unique peak groups (defined by m/z ratio and retention time) were detected
in both positive and negative mode ionization. The vast majority of
these peaks are noise or artifacts arising from the mass spectrometry,
chromatography, sample preparation, and data processing (see Supplementary
Figure 1 in the Supporting Information).10,24 A key component of this method is application of the default noise
filters of mzMatch.R and IDEOM to obtain a list of monoisotopic peaks
representing putative metabolites present in the label-free sample.
A total of 82 metabolites were identified confidently by exact mass
and retention time based on authentic metabolite standards (level
1 identification according to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative
(MSI)29). A total of 506 putative annotations
(levels 2 and 3, MSI) were made using exact mass and predicted retention
times from the IDEOM database (see Supplementary File 1 (Excel spreadsheet)
in the Supporting Information).9,24

The extent and pattern of labeling in each (putative) metabolite
was determined by an automated search of all potential isotopomers
according to accurate mass and retention time. Comparison of isotope
distributions with unlabeled samples, and with theoretical natural
isotope abundances, confirmed the presence of stable isotope labeling
for 187 metabolites (Figure 1a). Visualization
of labeled metabolites in the global metabolic network30 reveals incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into diverse
areas of metabolism (Figure 2).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic representation
of the method. Red dots represent
labeled metabolites. (b) Labeling pattern in succinate, aspartate,
and orotate biosynthesis. In contrast to the expected predominant
2- and 4-carbon labeling from the TCA cycle, the majority of molecules
contain three labeled carbons, consistent with a fermentative source
of succinate. (c) Heavy-isotope labeling patterns in the new trypanosomal
metabolites putatively annotated as octulose phosphate and nonulose
phosphate. C represents the unlabeled control, and L represents the 13C-glucose labeled sample.

metabolites labeled by 13C-glucose (red) and unlabeled
putative metabolites arising from alternative sources (gray). Inferred
potentially active biosynthesis pathways are highlighted; black routes
have not previously been known to be active in Trypanosoma
brucei. Map generated using IPath tools.30

The isotope labeling patterns generated from 50%
U-13C-labeled glucose allowed immediate identification
of many active
metabolic pathways within the cell. For example, the distinct labeling
pattern for succinate (Figure 1b) of predominantly
three labeled carbons is consistent with previous targeted studies
of trypanosomes that demonstrated a fermentation pathway primarily
responsible for succinate production, rather than a traditional TCA
cycle source.31,32 The results also show a similar
labeling pattern in aspartate and orotate, confirming biosynthesis
of aspartate from phosphoenolpyruvate (via oxaloacetate)
and subsequent de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The
enzymes required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis
have been identified and studied in bloodstream form trypanosomes,33,34 and here we provide the first direct evidence for de novo pyrimidine synthesis from glucose-derived aspartate in the procyclic
life-cycle stage despite the high abundance of aspartate and pyrimidines
available in the growth medium.

Extensive labeling was observed
in nucleotides and lipids (Figure 2 and Supplementary
File 1 (Excel spreadsheet) in
the Supporting Information). Nucleotide
labeling patterns confirm both de novo pyrimidine
synthesis (vide supra) and active purine salvage
pathways incorporating ribose 5-phosphate (five labeled carbons) from
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), while glycerophospholipid labeling
patterns revealed incorporation of three carbons from glycerol 3-phosphate
or dihydroxyacetone phosphate (products of glycolysis) and also two
carbon lipid chain extensions from acetyl-CoA.35 While acetyl-CoA was not observed in this study (being
incompatible with this chromatographic method), its presence can be
inferred from the two-carbon incorporation into lipids and by the
presence of two-carbon labeled acetyllysine and acetylcarnitine, although
the relatively low level of label incorporation into these metabolites
(15% and 21%, respectively) confirms previous reports that glucose
is not the primary source of acetyl-CoA.36 A single LC column that optimally separates polar and nonpolar metabolites
has yet to be successfully employed in metabolomics research. Notwithstanding,
our nontargeted approach is clearly capable of identifying metabolites
from a broad physicochemical spectrum and can be readily adapted to
protocols involving multiple columns to separate metabolites if even
more comprehensive coverage is required.

A key feature of the
untargeted metabolomics approach is the discovery
of unexpected labeling in metabolites and of labeling in unexpected
metabolites. The most striking cases of unexpected labeled metabolites
detected in our case study included glycerate and gluconate, potentially
arising from dephosphorylation of glycolysis-derived phosphoglycerate
and PPP-derived phosphogluconate, respectively, although specific
enzymes for these reactions have not been identified in T.
brucei. Importantly, prior knowledge of putative metabolite
identities is not essential for detection of isotopomers with our
method, and isotopomer profiling of unidentified peaks facilitates
the discovery of novel metabolites. In this example, two labeled metabolites
that were not present in online metabolite databases were detected
with m/z, retention time, and labeling
patterns consistent with octulose phosphate and nonulose phosphate
(Figure 1c). These metabolites are highly relevant
for trypanosome biology as they indicate the presence of new links
between the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways analogous to
recent findings in yeast,4 and further
work on these novel pathways may enable the discovery of new targets
for trypanosomal drugs.

Conclusions
As we show, untargeted LC–MS-based
metabolomics is able
to successfully map the extent of metabolism of stable isotope-labeled
glucose in procyclic-form trypanosomes. The results, obtained in a
single experiment, are generally consistent with many years of prior
research and genome annotations and also highlight new areas of metabolism
that would not have been detected by a traditional targeted approach.
The necessary computational analysis is straightforward and has been
automated and included in the mzMatch.R and IDEOM applications (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/), making it easy to apply the
same strategy to any organism to confirm the presence of metabolic
pathways, discover new pathways, confirm metabolic activity under
specific growth conditions or, by inclusion of multiple samples at
specified time points with concurrent quantitative analysis, measure
flux through a network.
