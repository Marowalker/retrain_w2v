Enhanced fucosylation has been suggested
as a marker for serologic
monitoring of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We
present a workflow for quantitative site-specific analysis of fucosylation
and apply it to a comparison of hemopexin (HPX) and complement factor
H (CFH), two liver-secreted glycoproteins, in healthy individuals
and patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC. Label-free LC-MS quantification
of glycopeptides derived from these purified glycoproteins was performed
on pooled samples (2 pools/group, 5 samples/pool) and complemented
by glycosidase assisted analysis using sialidase and endoglycosidase
F2/F3, respectively, to improve resolution of glycoforms. Our analysis,
presented as relative abundance of individual fucosylated glycoforms
normalized to the level of their nonfucosylated counterparts, revealed
a consistent increase in fucosylation in liver disease with significant
site- and protein-specific differences. We have observed the highest
microheterogeneity of glycoforms at the N187 site of HPX, absence
of core fucosylation at N882 and N911 sites of CFH, or a higher degree
of core fucosylation in CFH compared to HPX, but we did not identify
changes differentiating HCC from matched cirrhosis samples. Glycosidase
assisted LC-MS-MRM analysis of individual patient samples prepared
by a simplified protocol confirmed the quantitative differences. Transitions
specific to outer arm fucose document a disease-associated increase
in outer arm fucose on both bi- and triantennary glycans at the N187
site of HPX. Further verification is needed to confirm that enhanced
fucosylation of HPX and CFH may serve as an indicator of premalignant
liver disease. The analytical strategy can be readily adapted to analysis
of other proteins in the appropriate disease context.

==== Body
Glycosylation
is a common and
highly diverse modification of proteins.1,2 N-Glycans,
the focus of our discussion, are added to proteins through an amide
linkage to the Asn (N) side chain in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where
X is any amino acid except Pro, by a series of reactions catalyzed
by a complex enzymatic machinery localized in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and Golgi compartments.3 According
to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the majority of liver secreted proteins is
N-glycosylated at one or more sequons. All the N-linked glycans have
a common core structure, but the extension of the core by specific
glycosyltransferases leads to substantial diversity of monosaccharides
and their linkages in the mature glycans. N-Glycans associated with
proteins are therefore heterogeneous, and their composition changes
in disease context.4,5 However, the details of quantitative
changes in sequon occupancy and glycan microheterogeneity in disease
context are known only for a very limited set of proteins. It is therefore
of considerable interest to characterize and quantify the glycoforms
of liver secreted glycoproteins in the context of liver disease.6

Aberrant glycosylation, in general, and
increased fucosylation,
in particular, are increasingly recognized as an indicator of liver
disease progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common
type of liver cancer.7−19 More than 80% of HCC cases have underlying liver cirrhosis which
masks the initial symptoms of HCC development, substantially remodels
composition of liver secreted proteins, and thus represents a major
challenge for early detection of HCC.20 Despite an extensive search for a reliable HCC biomarker, only alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) is currently used in some countries for serologic monitoring
of HCC,20 but only two out of four HCC
subtypes are positive for AFP21 which leads
to relatively high false negative rates of HCC detection and limits
the usefulness of AFP as a diagnostic marker. Recent studies therefore
attempt to identify additional proteins and their disease specific
glycoforms, accompanying liver disease progression.11,18

A large portion of the reported serologic studies of liver
secreted
N-linked glycoproteins has been done on detached glycans.11,13,19,22−25 These informative analyses show that changes in specific glycans,
primarily fucosylated N-glycans, accompany development of liver disease.7,13,17 However, the studies of detached
glycans in complex samples have a common limitation in the undefined
changes of composition of the carrier proteins; the changes in protein
concentration can contribute significantly to the observed changes
in composition of detached N-glycans because glycosylation is protein-specific.24,26 Some reports focus on characterization of isolated proteins,10,11,19 but even these analyses average
in most cases across multiple N-glycosylation sites which limits specificity
of the observed changes.19,27 This is the major reason
why we focus on quantification of site specific protein glycoforms.

Glycoproteins exist as multiple glycoforms due to variability in
glycosylation site occupancy (percentage of a site occupied by N-glycan)
and microheterogeneity of glycan structures at each glycosylation
site. Increasing evidence documents that intramolecular glycosylation
is not uniform; glycoproteins carry different glycoforms at different
sites of N-glycan attachment.28,29 Reported site-specific
changes in protein glycosylation in cancer diseases substantiate the
need for their quantitative analysis in terms of disease detection
and classification.16,28,30 In the case of liver disease, changes in both outer arm and core
fucosylation were reported9−13,16−19 and AFP-L3, the core fucosylated
form of AFP, was introduced as an improved diagnostic test of HCC.31 Here, we examine site specific glycoforms of
two heme-binding liver secreted glycoproteins by glycosidase-assisted
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We document
quantitative changes of the resolved site-specific linkage isoforms
of fucosylated hemopexin (HPX) and complement factor H (CFH) which
provides new insights into liver disease processes and may ultimately
improve noninvasive disease monitoring.

Methods
Study Population
HCC patients (n =
10), cirrhotic patients (n = 10), and healthy individuals
(n = 10) were enrolled into the study in collaboration
with the Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Georgetown
University Hospital, Washington, D.C, under protocols approved by
the Institutional Review Board. The diagnosis of HCC was made by the
attending physician based on liver imaging and/or biopsy. All the
HCC patients had early stage disease (stage 1 and 2) according to
the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging
manual. All the patients (HCC and cirrhosis) had chronic hepatitis
C virus infection as the primary diagnosis. All participants were
matched on age, race (60% Caucasian, 40% African American), and gender
(80% males); HCC and cirrhosis groups were further matched on MELD
score and prothrombin time represented as International Normalized
Ratio (INR) (Table 1).

Isolation of Glycoproteins
from Plasma
Blood samples
were collected using EDTA Vacutainer tubes (BD Diagnostics, Franklin
Lakes, NJ); plasma was collected according to the manufacturer’s
protocol within 6 h of blood draw and was stored at −80 °C
until use. The samples of each study group were divided into two subsets
(n = 5 each) and, when needed, samples were pooled
by equal volume. HPX and CFH were isolated from plasma by hemin affinity
chromatography as described previously32 with slight modifications. Briefly, 200 μL of plasma was diluted
1:2 with PBS, loaded to 200 μL of hemin–agarose suspension
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and incubated overnight at 4 °C.
Bound glycoproteins were eluted with 0.2 M citric acid, pH 2.0, neutralized
with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, precipitated with methanol/chloroform as
described,33 solubilized in solvent A (2%
acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% TFA), and separated on an mRP Hi-Recovery
Protein 4.6 × 50 mm C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA) heated to 40 °C at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min as follows:
0–5 min 1% B, 10 min 35% B, 25 min 45% B, 30 min 100% B, 31
min 100% B, 33 min 1% B, 45 min 1% B (B: 98% ACN, 0.08% TFA). The
chromatogram was monitored at 214 and 280 nm, and HPX and CFH were
collected manually (Figure S-1, Supporting Information). Purified proteins were dried in a CentriVap vacuum concentrator
(Labconco, Kansas City, MO), reconstituted in 50 μL of 50 mM
NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, with 0.05% RapiGest (Waters,
Milford, MA), and stored at −20 °C until use.

Proteolytic
and Glycosidase Digests
Reconstituted proteins
were reduced with 5 mM DTT for 60 min at 60 °C and alkylated
with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Trypsin (Promega,
Madison, WI) digestion (2.5 ng/μL) was carried out at 37 °C
in Barocycler NEP2320 (Pressure BioSciences, South Easton, MA) for
1 h. Tryptic peptides derived from 2 μg of purified glycoprotein
were desialylated with 100 U of α(2-3,6,8)-neuraminidase (New
England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) in 50 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 5.5, at 37 °C for 20 h. For the analysis of core
fucosylation, tryptic peptides corresponding to 2 μg of purified
glycoprotein were vacuum evaporated, reconstituted in 50 mM sodium
acetate, pH 4.5, and digested with 1 μL of each endoglycosidase
F2 and F3 from Elizabethkingia miricola (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 37 °C for 12 h.

Glycopeptide Analysis by Nano LC-MS/MS
Glycopeptide
separation (without glycosidase treatment) was achieved on a Tempo
Capillary LC equipped with HiPLC-nanoflex (Eksigent, Framingham, MA)
using a nano cHiPLC trap, 200 μm × 0.5 mm, and analytical
ChromXP C18-CL, 3 μm, 300 Å columns (Eksigent, Framingham,
MA) interfaced with 5600 TripleTOF (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA). A 10 min trapping step
using 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid at 3 μL/min was followed by chromatographic
separation at 0.3 μL/min as follows: starting conditions 5%
ACN, 0.1% formic acid; 1–35 min, 5–50% ACN, 0.1% formic
acid; 35–37 min, 50–95% ACN, 0.1% formic acid; 37–40
min 95% ACN, 0.1% formic acid followed by equilibration to starting
conditions for an additional 20 min. For all runs, we have injected
1 μL (2 pmol) of sample directly after enzymatic digestion.
Analysis used an Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) workflow
with one full scan (400–1600 m/z) and 50 MS/MS fragmentations of major multiply charged precursor
ions with rolling collision energy. Mass spectra were recorded in
the MS range of 400–1600 m/z and MS/MS spectra in the range of 100–1800 m/z with resolution of 30 000 and mass accuracy
up to 2 ppm using the following experimental parameters: declustering
potential, 80 V; curtain gas, 15; ion spray voltage, 2300 V; ion source
gas 1, 20; interface heater, 180 °C; entrance potential, 10 V;
collision exit potential, 11 V; exclusion time, 5 s; collision energy
was set automatically according to m/z of the precursor. Data were processed using ProteinPilot 4.0 software
(AB Sciex, Framingham, MA); glycopeptides were screened by GlycoPeptideSearch,34,35 and all assignments were manually verified. Identified glycopeptides
were quantified using peak area from the extracted ion chromatogram
(XIC) of the precursor ion. Peak integration was performed manually
using MultiQuant 2.0 software (AB Sciex) using a 50 mDa window around
the theoretical monoisotopic precursor m/z. Internal peptides derived from HPX (GGYTLVSGYPK)
and CFH (SSNLIILEEHLK) were used for normalization.

Determination of Glycosylation Site Occupancy
Occupancy
of glycosylation sites was quantified by comparison of XIC precursor
ion intensities of deglycosylated [18O]-labeled and nonglycosylated
peptides acquired on the TripleTOF 5600 mass analyzer using an IDA
workflow following PNGaseF deglycosylation under H2[18O] as described.16

MRM Quantification
of Glycopeptides
HPX and CFH were
enriched from individual patient samples (50 μL of plasma) on
hemin–agarose as described above, followed by desalting (100
μg of protein in 1 mL of 0.1% TFA) on SPE cartridge Empore C18-SD
44 mm/1 mL (3M, Saint Paul, MN) activated with 1 mL of 50% ACN and
equilibrated with 1 mL of 0.1% TFA. The SPE column was washed with
3 mL of 0.1% TFA, eluted with 1 mL of 40% ACN, evaporated using a
vacuum concentrator, and dissolved for digestion in 25 mM NH4HCO3 to a final concentration of 1 μg/μL.
MRM quantification of desialylated samples (see above) was performed
as described previously36 with the following
modifications: RP nanoLC chromatography was interfaced with a 6500
Q-TRAP mass analyzer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) with conditions set
to curtain gas, 10; ion spray voltage, 2300 V; ion source gas, 20;
interface heater temperature, 180 °C; entrance potential, 10
V; and collision exit potential, 13. Chromatographic conditions were
as follows: starting conditions 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid; 0–1
min, 2–16.7% ACN, 0.1% formic acid; 1–10 min, 16.7–26.5%
ACN, 0.1% formic acid; 10–13 min 26.5–98% ACN, 0.1%
formic acid; 13–17 min, 98% ACN, 0.1% formic acid followed
by equilibration to starting conditions for additional 12 min.

Statistical
Analysis
Our study is a three-armed case-control
study among healthy controls, HCV-related cirrhosis without HCC, and
HCV-related cirrhosis with HCC groups. We have matched the three groups
on age, gender, and race. The two liver disease groups were additionally
matched on INR and MELD score (index of liver function damage). Quantitative
analysis of fucosylation of HPX and CFH in pooled samples was done
by a one-way ANOVA and t test for pairwise comparisons.37 MRM analysis used individual samples from the
pooled analysis (2 × 5 samples per group), and all groups were
matched as described above (Table 1). Normality
of distribution of the MRM data sets was confirmed for 7 of 11 glycopeptides
which were analyzed further by a t test and one-way
ANOVA adjusted by Bonferroni methods. Data that did not show a normal
distribution were analyzed by nonparametric tests (Kruskal–Wallis
test, Mann–Whitney U test) to confirm validity of the one-way
ANOVA findings. All reported p values are two sided.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS releases 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

Results and Discussion
Enhanced
fucosylation has been proposed as a marker of liver disease
progression to HCC, but a large portion of the studies has been done
on detached glycans isolated from crude protein mixtures (like serum)
or partially purified secreted glycoproteins.9−13,19,22−25 These studies provide valuable information about the disease-related
changes in glycan distribution, but quantitative information about
protein- and site-specific changes is rarely reported. In the present
study, we document a workflow allowing quantitative site- and glycan-specific
analysis of fucosylation in the context of liver disease. Our aim
is to provide further insight into changes in site-specific protein
glycoforms by improved quantitative analysis based on glycosidase
assisted LC-MS/MS and LC-MS-MRM.

Fucosylation changes with the
progression of liver disease and
specific changes are expected at the stage of cirrhosis and HCC.17,19 We performed our analysis of fucosylation on plasma samples of patients
with liver cirrhosis and HCC, matched on the extent of liver damage
(Table 1), and we compared them to samples
obtained from healthy volunteers. This is essential for unbiased quantification
of HCC-related glycoforms. Two abundant liver-secreted glycoproteins,
HPX and CFH, were selected for analysis. Fucosylated HPX, a 60 kDa
heme-binding glycoprotein with five N-glycosylation sites, has been
suggested as a candidate HCC marker by previous studies,9,11,38 but site-specific analysis of
its glycoforms has not been reported. CFH, a 140 kDa plasma glycoprotein
with nine N-glycosylation sites, is a major regulator of the alternative
complement pathway39 that mediates the
escape of malignant cells from complement-cytotoxicity.40−43 No information in this regard is available for HCC, and we are not
aware of any study reporting glycosylation changes in CFH in the context
of liver disease.

Both glycoproteins were isolated from human
plasma by heme affinity
chromatography followed by protein RP-HPLC as described.32 We do this because HPX has the highest reported
affinity toward heme (Kd < 1 pmol/L)44,45 and direct binding of CFH to heme has also been reported.46 A typical RP-HPLC chromatogram shows that HPX
and CFH were major components of the heme bound fraction and were
free of major contaminants after the RP isolation (Figure S-1, Supporting Information). Tryptic glycopeptides
derived from HPX and CFH are listed in Table S-1 (Supporting Information). All NXS/T sequons in both proteins
are reported to be glycosylated.45,47,48 We analyzed three HPX glycopeptides, corresponding
to glycosites N64, N187, and N453, and four CFH glycopeptides, corresponding
to sites N217, N882, N911, and N1029. We did not attempt to analyze
doubly glycosylated tryptic peptides and CFH peptides corresponding
to glycosites N529, N718, and N1095 which were out of fragmentation
range of our LC-MS/MS instrumentation.

Site occupancy is an
important quantitative parameter which can
change in the context of disease.49 We
have determined occupancy in pooled samples of the three patient groups.
Our analysis shows that all analyzed sites were highly occupied without
significant differences among patient groups (Table S-2, Supporting Information). This is important to
know because a change in occupancy would affect the quantitative comparison
of glycoforms.

Analysis of Glycopeptides in Pooled Samples
before Glycosidase
Digestion
We have first analyzed tryptic peptides of HPX
and CFH isolated from pooled samples (5 samples per pool, 2 pools
per group) prior to glycosidase digest (Table S-3, Supporting Information). All glycosites on both proteins were
dominated by fully sialylated biantennary glycans with minor contribution
of undersialylated biantennary forms (nomenclature is in agreement
with the NIBRT GlycoBase).50 Triantennary
complex glycans were detected at a subset of the sites (N187 of HPX
and N882, 911, and 1029 of CFH) while tetra-antennary sialylated glycoforms
were below the limit of detection at all sites except HPX N187. Fucosylation,
the subject of this study, was limited to singly fucosylated glycoforms
which is in stark contrast to our previously reported analysis of
haptoglobin, in the same population, where multiply fucosylated glycoforms
with up to six fucoses per glycan were detectable in liver disease.16 Nevertheless, the tendency toward enhanced fucosylation
in liver disease groups was clearly detected (Table S-3, Supporting Information).

This is even better
visualized by comparison of the ratio of corresponding fucosylated
to nonfucosylated glycoforms (Figure 1). Approximation
of quantities by the XIC signal intensity is reasonable because under
the conditions of our study fucose has minimal effect on chromatographic
retention time and ionization efficiency (Figure S-2, Supporting Information). This relative quantification
allows one to compare the structure-specific fucosylation changes
without the need for an internal standard as described for haptoglobin51 and α-2 macroglobulin.30 Our analysis confirms a clear trend toward enhanced fucosylation
in liver disease but not a clear difference between cirrhosis and
HCC. Interestingly, while fully sialylated structures dominated undersialylated
glycoforms in both HPX and CFH (Table S-3, Supporting
Information), undersialylated structures are fucosylated to
a greater degree (Figure 1A, N187, compare
triantennary A3G3S2 and A3G3S3; Figure 1A,
N453, and Figure 1B, N911 and N1029, compare
biantennary A2G2S1 and A2G2S2).

group of corresponding bars representing three patient groups; the
position of the glycosylation site in the protein sequence is shown
below. Results are shown as mean ± SD; ∗, P < 0.05 vs H; #, P < 0.05 HCC vs CIR.

Analysis of Desialylated
Glycopeptides in Pooled Samples
Sialylated glycopeptides
have lower ionization efficiencies in positive
ionization mode, and the degree of sialylation contributes to microheterogeneity
at each glycosite which leads, ultimately, to lower sensitivity of
detection of fucosylated glycoforms we are interested in. In order
to enhance sensitivity, we desialylated samples from the above analysis
with nonspecific neuraminidase cleaving all sialic acids with the
α(2-3,6,8) linkage as described previously.36 Under these conditions, we have detected quantifiable amounts
of singly fucosylated triantennary glycans at three additional peptides,
N64 and N453 of HPX and N911 of CFH (Table S-4, Supporting Information). Relative quantification of the corresponding
glycoforms shows increased fucosylation in liver disease compared
to healthy controls (Figure 2). We observe
that the triantennary glycoforms have a substantially higher proportion
of fucosylated structures compared to their biantennary counterparts.
In healthy controls, the ratio of fucosylated to nonfucosylated biantennary
glycoforms ranges from 2% to 13%, while the ratio of triantennary
glycoforms ranges from 15% to 200% with a large increase at each individual
glycosite (Figure 2). The largest difference
was detected at N64 of hemopexin with A2G2F1 (6%) compared to A3G3F1
(200%), but the observation holds true for every site (Figure 2). In addition, we were able to detect doubly fucosylated
triantennary and singly fucosylated tetra-antennary glycan structures
at the N187 site of hemopexin (Figure 2A);
these structures were reported to be associated with HCC in a study
of detached glycans.11 The sum of intensities
of the above two glycans (A3G3F2 + A4G4F1) divided by the intensity
of A2G2 was used to distinguish HCC from cirrhosis. We did not find
changes in this ratio (0.0142 ± 0.011 for cirrhosis, 0.0133 ±
0.0045 for HCC; see Table S-4, Supporting Information). This is possibly related to the difference between the studied
populations or the difference in the quantification of detached glycans
and glycopeptides. Since we did not analyze structures attached to
doubly glycosylated hemopexin peptide N*GTGHGN*STHHGPEYMR, our analysis
may be missing potentially informative glycans attached to this site,
but it is also possible that other glycoproteins contributed to the
total pool of glycans in the above study11 because hemin-affinity purification was the only purification step
performed which is in our hands insufficient to achieve hemopexin
purity (Figure S-1, Supporting Information). In addition, the HCC group in the reported study had significantly
increased levels of C-reactive protein over the cirrhosis group11 which might be a factor contributing to these
discrepancies. Overall, the tendency toward enhanced fucosylation
is apparent in liver disease compared to healthy subjects, but we
did not observe significant HCC-specific changes.

Analysis of Core Fucosylation
in Pooled Samples
The
preceding analysis does not allow unequivocal differentiation of core
α(1–6) linkage from outer arm fucosylation; these modifications
are carried out by a different set of enzymes and are important to
distinguish in the liver disease context.11,19,52 To quantify core fucosylation, we treated
glycopeptides with a combination of endoglycosidase F2 and F3. This
cleaves complex bi- and triantennary glycans leaving the innermost
N-linked GlcNAc with or without core fucose attached to the peptide. We have utilized both enzymes in excess and did not observe any residual
uncleaved glycopeptides after overnight digest. The proportion of
core fucosylated peptides, expressed as a percent of the nonfucosylated
form, is presented in Figure 3. In the case
of HPX, core fucose was identified on all three singly glycosylated
peptides. The percentage of core fucose in healthy subjects was below
5% on all sites; a tendency toward an increased ratio of fucosylated
structures was observed in liver disease, but this increase was minor
(Figure 3A). In contrast, core fucosylation
of CFH was clearly elevated in the liver disease groups at N217 and
N1029 positions (Figure 3B), but a difference
between cirrhosis and HCC groups was not observed. We did not detect
any core fucosylation at N882 and N911 sites of CFH although the nonfucosylated
glycopeptides were readily detected. This indicates that the changes
in overall fucosylation at these sites (Figures 1, 2, and 4) are associated
with alterations in outer arm fucosylation.

Figure 3 Core fucosylation in
pooled samples of healthy controls (H), cirrhosis
(CIR), and HCC patients. Core fucosylation of (A) hemopexin and (B)
CFH was analyzed following endoglycosidase F2/F3 treatment. Relative
abundance of each fucosylated glycoform, quantified as area of precursor
ion XIC peak, is presented as a percent of its nonfucosylated counterpart.
The position of the glycosylation site in the protein sequence is
shown below the corresponding group of bars representing three patient
groups. Results are shown as mean ± SD; ∗, P < 0.05 vs H; ND, nondetectable.

Figure 4 Fucosylation of desialylated glycopetides in individual samples
of healthy controls (H), cirrhosis (CIR), and HCC patients. Tryptic
glycopeptides of (A) hemopexin and (B) CFH from the heme-bound fraction
of individual patient samples were quantified by LC-MS MRM. Data are
expressed as a relative ratio of signal intensities of fucosylated
glycopeptide to its nonfucosylated counterpart monitored as the 366
transition (Hex–HexNAc) and shown as percent of the nonfucosylated
form. Glycan structures representing specific glycoforms are indicated
above each group of corresponding bars; the position of the glycosylation
site in the protein sequence is shown below. Inset. Comparison of
total and outer arm fucosylation at the N187 site of hemopexin. Outer
arm fucosylation was quantified as the 512 transition (Fuc–GlcNAc–Gal)
of fucosylated precursor normalized to the 366 transition of its nonfucosylated
counterpart; total fucosylation was quantified as above. The relative
change in fucosylation in liver disease groups is shown as a percent
of H. OA; outer arm fucosylation. Results are shown as mean ±
SEM; ∗, P < 0.05 vs H.

The striking difference in core fucosylation of CFH at different
glycosites substantiates the need for site specific analysis. Maturation
of glycans, including core fucosylation, takes place in the Golgi
compartment and is believed to occur on fully folded proteins.53 It has been therefore proposed that core fucosylation
depends on solvent accessibility at the site of fucosylation.29 The two sites without core fucose have rather
low predicted accessibility;29 thus, a
low level of core fucosylation would be expected. Conversely, we clearly
detected core fucose at N1029 which has even lower predicted accessibility.
In addition, core fucose was not detected at N1095 (data not shown)
which has the highest predicted solvent accessibility of all the above
sites. This indicates that site accessibility, although potentially
an important factor overall, does not explain the differences of core
fucosylation in the case of CFH.

Besides the peptides shown
in Figure 3,
we also analyzed core fucosylation at peptide WDPEVN*CSMAQIQLCPPPPQIPNSHN*MTTTLNYR doubly glycosylated at positions N802 and
N822 (relative abundance of the fucosylated glycoform 13.040 ±
0.949, 57.510 ± 2.003, and 48.251 ± 9.127 for healthy, cirrhosis,
and HCC, respectively, expressed as percent of nonfucosylated counterpart).
Interestingly, either both sites or neither of them were core fucosylated;
we did not find any peptide fucosylated at only one of the two positions.
The amount of this doubly fucosylated peptide increases 4-fold in
liver disease but to the same degree in the cirrhosis and HCC groups.

MRM Analysis of Desialylated Glycopeptides in Individual Samples
To validate the results of our analysis of pooled samples, we employed
an MRM workflow to quantify site specific glycoforms in individual
patient samples. CFH and HPX were partially purified by hemin-affinity
(as for pooled samples) and further enriched on the C18 SPE cartridge
using conditions based on RP-HPLC separation. Elution with 40% acetonitrile
was sufficient to elute both proteins and eliminate more hydrophobic
protein contaminants. In order to eliminate the potential variations
in binding capacity, we used aliquots of the same batch of hemin–agarose
beads for all samples. The enriched hemin-bound fraction was digested
by trypsin, and HPX and CFH glycopeptides were desialylated with neuraminidase
prior to MRM analysis. Of the monitored MRM transitions (Table S-5, Supporting Information), glycopeptide precursor
→ 366.1 (Hex–HexNAc) transition, the most intense transition,
was used for quantitative comparisons. We present a comparison of
relative abundances of the fucosylated form normalized to the intensity
of its nonfucosylated counterpart in Figure 4 (n = 10 per group). The dot plot version of Figure 4 showing the distribution of individual values is
provided in the Supporting Information (Figure
S-3), and quantitative data for each patient are shown in Table S-6
(Supporting Information). Due to high signal-to-noise,
we could not reliably quantify A3G3F1 at N64, A3G3F2 and A4G4F1 at
N187, and A3G3F1 at N453; quantitative data obtained on the remaining
structures for both HPX and CFH closely resemble those obtained by
XIC-based quantification on pooled samples (Figure 2) and validate the results.

The transition glycopeptide
precursor → 512.2 (Fuc–GlcNAc–Gal) was used to
determine the presence of outer arm fucosylation. We could quantify
the 512 transition at the two core fucose-lacking glycosites of CFH
(N882 and N911) and at the N187 site of hemopexin (inset in Figure 4A). The intensity of the 512 transition of the fucosylated
glycopeptide was normalized to the intensity of the 366 transition
of its nonfucosylated counterpart. For total fucosylation, the 366
transition was used for both fucosylated and nonfucosylated form.
Because of differences in intensities between the two transitions,
data are presented as a percent of healthy controls. Outer arm fucose
was identified on both biantennary (A2G2) and triantennary (A3G3)
glycans, and the level of fucosylation was increased to the same extent
in both liver disease groups. The comparison with core fucosylation
at the same site (Figure 3A, N187), which is
not significantly altered in disease, allows us to conclude that the
liver disease-related increase in fucosylation at this site is due
to enhanced outer arm fucosylation. For other sites with detected
core fucosylation (Figure 3, N64 and N453 of
HPX and N217 and N1029 of CFH), the intensity of the 512 transition
was indistinguishable from noise, indicating that core fucose is the
major contributor to the fucosylation.

Conclusions
Our
glycosidase assisted workflow documents efficient analysis
of site specific fucosylated glycoforms by LC-MSMS in pooled samples
followed by simplified LC-MS-MRM quantification in a larger set of
individual samples. The results document significant increases in
fucosylation of HPX and CFH in the context of liver disease. Sialidase
improves the sensitivity of detection of fucosylated glycopeptides.
Digestion with endoglycosidase F2/F3 enables site-specific quantitative
analysis of core fucosylation. Using the glycosidase-assisted approach,
we have identified striking differences in core fucosylation among
different glycosites of CFH as well as a higher degree of microheterogeneity
at the N187 glycosite of HPX. The combination of glycosidase assisted
analyses and specific CID fragmentation shows that the percent of
core fucosylation is site-specific and higher in CFH than in HPX.
The lack of changes differentiating HCC from cirrhosis in samples
matched on liver damage indicates that increased fucosylation of hemopexin
and CFH reflects the extent of damage of liver tissue rather than
malignant transformation. This is further supported by correlation
analysis in individual samples of liver disease patients showing positive
association between the degree of fucosylation and MELD score and
negative correlation with serum albumin (Figure S-4, Supporting Information). We present correlation analysis for
site N217 of CFH, but the observation holds true for the remaining
glycosites on both glycoproteins. These observations demonstrate the
advantages of site-specific glycopeptide analysis and efficiency of
the glycosidase assisted LC-MS-MRM workflow in quantitative comparisons
of protein glycosylation.
