We describe temperature-ramped spin-exchange
optical pumping (TR-SEOP)
in an automated high-throughput batch-mode 129Xe hyperpolarizer
utilizing three key temperature regimes: (i) “hot”—where
the 129Xe hyperpolarization rate is maximal, (ii) “warm”—where
the 129Xe hyperpolarization approaches unity, and (iii)
“cool”—where hyperpolarized 129Xe
gas is transferred into a Tedlar bag with low Rb content (<5 ng
per ∼1 L dose) suitable for human imaging applications. Unlike
with the conventional approach of batch-mode SEOP, here all three
temperature regimes may be operated under continuous high-power (170
W) laser irradiation, and hyperpolarized 129Xe gas is delivered
without the need for a cryocollection step. The variable-temperature
approach increased the SEOP rate by more than 2-fold compared to the
constant-temperature polarization rate (e.g., giving effective values
for the exponential buildup constant γSEOP of 62.5
± 3.7 × 10–3 min–1 vs
29.9 ± 1.2 × 10–3 min–1) while achieving nearly the same maximum %PXe value (88.0 ± 0.8% vs 90.1% ± 0.8%, for a 500
Torr (67 kPa) Xe cell loading—corresponding to nuclear magnetic
resonance/magnetic resonance imaging (NMR/MRI) enhancements of ∼3.1
× 105 and ∼2.32 × 108 at the
relevant fields for clinical imaging and HP 129Xe production
of 3 T and 4 mT, respectively); moreover, the intercycle “dead”
time was also significantly decreased. The higher-throughput TR-SEOP
approach can be implemented without sacrificing the level of 129Xe hyperpolarization or the experimental
stability for automation—making this approach beneficial for
improving the overall 129Xe production rate in clinical
settings.

==== Body
Hyperpolarized
(HP) magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is poised to revolutionize the field of molecular
imaging by enabling the tomographic detection of dilute nuclear spin
systems with biochemical specificity but without ionizing radiation.1 In particular, HP gas imaging (e.g., 129Xe, 3He, etc.) has been applied to measure lung function,2−11 and recent developments in the field of 129Xe hyperpolarizer
technology9,12−17 make HP 129Xe an attractive and feasible diagnostic tool
for a large variety of potential biomedical applications.2,8 One of the main bottlenecks for the widespread clinical translation
of 129Xe HP imaging has been the paucity of fast, inexpensive,
and high-capacity 129Xe hyperpolarizers that can satisfy
the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory agencies.

Most 129Xe hyperpolarization setups utilize spin-exchange
optical pumping (SEOP),18 a process in
which circularly polarized photons optically pump Rb electrons, which
in turn hyperpolarize the 129Xe nuclear spins via the hyperfine
interaction (the “spin-exchange” process)—shown
schematically in Figure 1a. Several 129Xe polarizer designs have been developed12−14 over the past
decade, including our open-source clinical-scale prototype14,19 and our recently published 3D-printed hyperpolarizer15,20 that can deliver near-unity 129Xe nuclear spin polarization.
Nevertheless, many current 129Xe polarization efforts are
now focused on the goal of increasing the production rate of HP 129Xe at high polarization (PXe)—frequently quantified as the production rate in units of
HP 129Xe L/h. Fundamentally, higher HP 129Xe
production rates (obtained, e.g., using more Xe-rich gas mixtures
or faster flow rates in continuous-flow SEOP) generally result in
lower %PXe13,20—posing
a production barrier.

optical
pumping (SEOP) using a high-power laser diode array (LDA) and 0.5
L optical pumping (OP) cell. (b) A brief qualitative summary of 129Xe SEOP parameter regions studied here Xe density and incident
laser power. Note that <5 ng of residual Rb quantity in the Tedlar
bag (after HP gas expansion) has been utilized in FDA-approved clinical
trial protocols.

Batch SEOP of a Xe/N2 gas mixture can be canonically
described by %PXe(t)
= %Pmax[1 – exp(−γSEOPt)],18,21 where %Pmax is the maximum %PXe at t → ∞ and γSEOP is the exponential buildup rate constant. %Pmax and γSEOP vary with temperature, Xe/N2 polarizing mixture composition, and laser photon flux (which
affects γSEOP through induced temperature changes). Following previous efforts studying batch-mode SEOP at much smaller
scales and resonant laser fluxes,22−25 multiparameter (laser power,
temperature, and Xe fraction) mapping14,20 of hyperpolarization
conditions was recently performed in a 3D-printed clinical-scale 129Xe hyperpolarizer.15 These results
demonstrated a mismatch between polarizing conditions corresponding
to the maximum 129Xe polarization %Pmax and those corresponding to greatest stable γSEOP rate for a given Xe/N2 composition and laser
power; the temperature condition yielding the greatest %Pmax value typically corresponded to a relatively low γSEOP value and vice versa20 (Figure 1b)—suggesting that a multitemperature approach
could significantly improve the HP 129Xe production efficiency.
Furthermore, both conditions (i.e., those yielding maximum %Pmax and maximum γSEOP) require
that the OP-cell be cooled down to reduce Rb gas-phase concentration
to an acceptable level before HP gas transfer prior to patient administration.14,19 In this work, we describe a new approach for automated batch-mode
preparation of HP gases: temperature-ramped (TR)
SEOP, which enables rapid PXe buildup,
high maximum 129Xe polarization, and low Rb content of
the final HP gas dose in one hyperpolarization procedure comprising
three key steps: (i) a fast HP 129Xe buildup rate (i.e.,
high γSEOP) step, (ii) a high steady-state %Pmax step, and (iii) a cool-down step characterized
by low γSEOP and %Pmax values but with a low residual Rb content acceptable for clinical
applications. The TR-SEOP approach significantly reduces the polarization
cycle time compared to conventional constant-temperature SEOP (optimized
only to obtain the highest value of %Pmax), thereby markedly improving the rate of HP 129Xe production—one
of the main bottlenecks for clinical translation for some applications.
The added benefits of the described approach are a significantly simplified
design with greater ease of automation.

Experimental Methods
129Xe Hyperpolarizer
The previously described
3D-printed 129Xe polarizer was used for the production
of HP 129Xe15 following the
addition of an improved gas-handling manifold: the positive-pressure
gas-handling manifold is shown in detail in Figure 2. The manifold consists of several Teflon pneumatic valves
(International Polymer Solutions Inc., Irvine, CA): the default position
for some of these values is “open” (green valves, part
no. M222OPFR-T), whereas for others the default position is “closed”
(large brown valves, part no. M222CPFR-T; small brown valves, part
no. S112CPFR-T). The OP-cell (Midrivers Glass Blowing, St. Charles,
MO, P/N MRG350-10)15 is initially filled
with unpolarized gas via a manifold of stainless steel Swagelok and
VCR connections, and includes a zeolite getter to remove oxygen (Entegris
Inc., Chaska, MN, part no. WGFG01KP3) and a digital pressure gauge.
Flexible 1/8 in. o.d. (1/16 in. i.d.) Teflon tubing lines are used
to transfer the Xe/N2 gas mixture into the OP-cell, and
also comprise the in vivo “clinical path” for transferring
HP gas out of the OP-cell and into various storage/transport containers
including Tedlar bags. The HP gas transfer line includes a filtering
element (Entegris Inc., Chaska, MN, part no. CE100 KFI4R) designed
to remove residual Rb. One-way check valves (Western Analytical, Wildomar,
CA, Biochek CO-5C) on the HP gas-transfer side further prevent back-flow
and contamination of the OP-cell with atmospheric O2. The
entire manifold can be evacuated to 7.5 × 10–5 Torr with the hyperpolarizer’s vacuum pump system (Edwards
vacuum, U.K., model no. TS75W1002). However, as in many continuous-flow
polarizers (e.g., refs (12, 16, and 26)), the portion of the manifold
upstream of the cell is maintained at a constant (over)pressure of
2.7 atm; combined with the use of a premixed Xe/N2 gas
source, this design eliminates the delay times associated with evacuation/purge
cycles and gas mixing involved with cell loading. Thus, after the
preparation of each HP 129Xe dose, the OP-cell is immediately
reloaded with a fresh batch of Xe/N2 gas mix via the manifold.
This approach also reduces concern of atmospheric O2 leaking
into this portion of the manifold (or the OP-cell).

Figure 2 Positive-pressure gas
loading manifold (nominal pressure is 2.7
atm for a 0.5 L OP-cell), which consists of Teflon pneumatic valves
and tubing, one-way check valves, in-line O2 and Rb getters/filters,
vacuum and pressure sensors, and two exit paths: “in vivo”
(i.e., for clinical use) and “in vitro” (i.e., for experiments
not involving living organisms). Implementation of the Rb filter does
not appear to measurably impact 129Xe hyperpolarization
(ref (20)).

OP-Cell Preparation
While the OP-cell
design and procedure
for preparation was described earlier,15,20 the details
pertinent to the presented work are provided below.

The cell
consists of a main Pyrex tubular body 9.75 in. in length with an outer
diameter (o.d.) of 2.125 in. and inner diameter (i.d.) of 2 in. with
the ends sealed using 2.125 in. optical flats to create an internal
volume of ∼500 mL. Two threaded side stems (Chem-Glass P/N
CG-350-10) used for transferring gas in and out of the OP-cell are
attached orthogonal to the main body and are sealed using Teflon stopcock
valves (Chem-Glass P/N CG-934-01). Each cell is pressure tested to
∼3.5 atm above atmospheric pressure before being approved for
experimental operation.

Each cell is prepared by first removing
the Teflon stopcock valves
before being placed in KOH/methanol base-bath for a 24 h period to
remove any impurities attached to the glass surface during its construction
or from previous experimental use. The cell is then removed from the
base bath and rinsed with distilled water, followed by methanol, and
repeated at least three times. The cell is then submerged in 50/50
water–methanol solution and further ultrasonically cleaned
for ∼1 h before being rinsed again with distilled water and
followed with methanol before it is then placed inside a low-temperature
(100 °C) oven to evaporate any residual methanol. Once the cell
has dried and cooled, the next step is to coat the interior surface
with siliconizing agent (Surfrasil, P/N PI-42800, Fisher Scientific),
which is prepared by diluting 1 mL of Surfrasil with 9 mL of hexane.
The prepared siliconizing solution is then poured into the cell via
a side stem and then gently swirled for several minutes to coat all
internal surfaces. The siliconizing solution is then removed and the
cell is rinsed with hexane. The cell is then connected to vacuum to
remove any residual hexane before it is once again placed in the low-temperature
oven to be dried. This siliconized coating prevents direct contact
of HP 129Xe with the glass surface and any paramagnetic
centers that may exist in the glass, thus preventing 129Xe depolarization and increasing 129Xe in-cell T1 relaxation time. Achieving long in-cell 129Xe T1 times is key in building
up high levels of hyperpolarization in batch-mode SEOP.

Once
the OP-cell is dried and cooled, it is then ready to be loaded
with ∼250 mg of molten Rb alkali metal through one of the side
stems using a glass pipet to deposit a small droplet. This entire
process is performed under an inert nitrogen gas atmosphere inside
a glovebox to prevent oxidation of the Rb. The Teflon stopcock valves
are then used to seal the OP-cell prior to its removal from the glovebox.
The sealed cell is then connected to a dedicated gas-loading manifold
(not of a hyperpolarizer), where it is evacuated down to <10–3 Torr and then sealed again in preparation for Rb
distribution. The Rb droplet is then vaporized using a heat gun to
localize heat (which is also used to heat the optical windows to prevent
Rb from depositing on both optical windows of the OP-cell). While
the droplet is being heated, cooled N2 gas from a pressurized
liquid nitrogen Dewar is gently sprayed toward the exterior cell surface
forcing condensation of Rb to form a fine layer of Rb coating down
the entire length of the cell. The cell is then evacuated again to
remove any nitrogen gas that had degassed from the Rb, and the process
is repeated until no further degassing occurs. The well-distributed,
fine Rb coating likely helps SEOP by increasing the Rb surface-to-volume
ratio, allowing it to more rapidly equilibrate globally (i.e., throughout
the OP-cell) with the gas-phase concentration during heating and cooling.
Once the cell has been Rb-coated, the cell is then evacuated again
and then loaded to ∼1240 Torr (24 psi setting of the gauge)
above atmospheric pressure with the desired 129Xe/N2 gas composition and sealed.

Low-Field in Situ NMR Spectroscopy
Low-field in situ
NMR spectroscopy, used to measure PXe,
was performed using the radio frequency (rf) coil and the magnet setup
described previously;20 the spectrometer
operated at 47 kHz for both 129Xe (B0 = 4.00 mT) and proton (B0 = 1.10
mT). In situ 129Xe polarization was calculated using the 1H NMR signals from a reference sample of water protons.15,20129Xe polarization was sampled every 12 min during buildup
and decay using low-tipping-angle rf excitation pulses (≪15°)
emitted by a small rf coil, causing negligible detectable loss of 129Xe hyperpolarization even after the application of several
(∼12–30) rf pulses.20

129Xe SEOP Hyperpolarization Conditions
All polarization experiments
were conducted with a 2 in. diameter
laser beam delivering 170 W of circularly polarized light (QPC Lasers)
incident on the 2 in. diameter window of the OP-cell (0.5 L volume)
filled with 500 Torr (67 kPa) natural abundance Xe (26.44%) and 1500
Torr (200 kPa) ultrahigh purity N2 using a 25:75 premixed
Xe/N2 cylinder (Nova Gas Technologies).

Measurements
of 129Xe SEOP Buildup and Decay Kinetics
SEOP
buildup of 129Xe hyperpolarization was measured
at four different temperatures: 42, 55, 72, and 74 °C or with
a ramped temperature within this range. A simple monoexponential function
was fit to each experimental time-dependent data set as follows: %PXe(t) = %Pmax[1 – exp(−γSEOPt)] + %PXe(0), where γSEOP = γSE + ΓXe = kSE[Rb] + ΓXe; γSE is the Rb/129Xe spin-exchange rate and ΓXe is the HP 129Xe spin-destruction rate (ΓXe = 1/T1),14 giving γSEOP = γSE + ΓXe = kSE[Rb] + 1/T1. 129Xe T1 was
measured by monitoring the decay of HP 129Xe every 12 min
at 20 °C by low-field in situ NMR in the absence of laser irradiation
(see, for example, Figure 3b).

Figure 3 129Xe optical
pumping (hyperpolarization) buildup curves
for an OP-cell filled with 500 Torr 129Xe/1500 Torr N2 gas mixture under variable temperatures of 42, 55, 72, 74
°C, and TR-SEOP (74 → 72 °C).

OP-Cell Cool-Down Procedure
Typically in batch-mode
optical pumping, the OP-cell must be cooled prior to HP 129Xe transfer to reduce the gas-phase Rb concentration to a level safe
for administration to patients (e.g., <5 ng limits have been approved
by FDA for previous 129Xe hyperpolarizers). The cryocollection
of HP 129Xe utilized by most hyperpolarizers (to accumulate
and concentrate HP 129Xe and remove buffer gases) also
helps to remove residual Rb; however, cryocollection can also result
in hyperpolarization losses and adds significantly to instrument complexity
(hampering full automation). Proper cool-down of the OP-cell (while
minimizing hyperpolarization losses in the gas phase) followed by
rapid transfer of HP 129Xe directly into a Tedlar bag obviates
the cryocollection step.14,27 Our approach14,19 uses only the aforementioned in-line Rb filter/getter to further
reduce residual Rb content.

Absorption of laser emission from
high-power sources can cause significant residual heating of OP-cells.
The previously described OP-cell cooling procedure (here dubbed “XeNA cool-down”)14,19 utilizes a
rapid and significant reduction in laser power (typically staying
on or near resonance) while the OP-cell’s oven is actively
cooled with the chilled (∼0 °C) output from a self-pressurized
liquid N2 Dewar—resulting in only a minor loss of 129Xe hyperpolarization prior to Xe transfer.14,19 While effective, use of such Dewars for OP-cell/oven cooling is
cumbersome, results in significant liquid N2 consumption
over time, and would be challenging to automate. At the price of decreased
cooling power (and hence speed), the current design avoids all of
these problems by instead using a thermoelectric cooler15 (TEC; Kryotherm, Saint-Petersburg, Russia, P/N
380-24-AA) with recirculating air flow to regulate the OP-cell’s
temperature. Correspondingly, a modified cell cooling procedure was
developed (here referred to as “XeUS cool-down”—again following the name of the hyperpolarizer):
After a high level of HP 129Xe is achieved (e.g., at 72
°C), the TEC switches into maximum cooling mode and the OP-cell
temperature is reduced (here, either to 55 or 42 °C); cooling
times for 72–55 °C and 72–42 °C transitions
were ∼12 and ∼24 min, respectively (Figure 4a; precision was limited by the in situ %PXe NMR sampling rate). Decay time constants
of 129Xe hyperpolarization were measured after the cell
temperature was stabilized for a given condition. In two separate
runs performed under identical conditions (terminating at 55 or 42
°C, respectively), the contents of the OP-cell were expanded
into Tedlar bags (1 L volume, Jensen Inert Products, part no. GSTPOO1-0707S)
via the gas manifold (Figure 2) for elemental
analysis (by ICPMS; Element One, Inc., Wilmington, NC) to quantify
residual Rb in the resulting ∼0.8 L volume of HP 129Xe gas. LDA power was maintained
at 170 W at all times during OP-cell cool-down (except for 55–42
°C cool-down phase, where it was temporarily set to ∼150
W and off-resonance condition; the power reduction was achieved by
decreasing the LDA current, which resulted in lower output power and
LDA detuning from the resonant frequency) and refill—simplifying
polarizer operation and automation.

and decay curves of the
OP cell cool down to 42 and 55 °C, respectively, of 500 Torr 129Xe. (b) T1 decay of hyperpolarized 129Xe (500 Torr partial pressure) at room temperature with
the laser turned off.

Results and Discussion
Examples of buildup curves showing
the 129Xe polarization
dynamics obtained using either conventional (constant-temperature)
SEOP or TR-SEOP are provided in Figure 3; a
corresponding summary of %Pmax and γSEOP values is provided in Table 1.
For the constant-temperature curves γSEOP increases
steeply with temperature (as expected), owing to the growth of the
γSE term because of its dependence on [Rb]—which
approximately doubles with each ∼10 °C increment in this
regime.28 Indeed, at 74 °C γSEOP is anomalously high: 77.8(±4.0) × 10–3 min–1 compared to 29.9(±1.2) × 10–3 min–1 at 72 °C (just 2 °C
lower). This ∼2.6-fold increase indicates that [Rb] is significantly
higher than what would be expected based on the externally measured
OP-cell temperature,28 indicative of metastable
conditions where increased laser absorption begins to result in more
elevated gas temperatures and greater energy dissipation into the
inner cell walls (and hence higher [Rb] in the vapor phase)—a
condition dubbed “Rb prerunaway”.20 Values for %Pmax also increased
with temperature but peaked at 72 °C, with %Pmax(74 °C) being lower by 5.0% ± 1.2% (Table 1). Moreover, this difference is likely to be greater
under the condition of more Xe-rich batch SEOP gas mixes, where %Pmax is further away from unity. In addition
to improved stability, values for %Pmax also increased in TR-SEOP versus %Pmax(74 °C), 88.0% ± 0.9% versus 85.1% ± 0.9% (Table 1). Furthermore, the ultimate goal of the SEOP procedure
is to maximize %Pmax in biomedical applications,
and even small gains in %Pmax are welcomed.
Such behavior has been observed previously,14,15,19,20,24 and can be explained by the decrease in the spatial
average of the Rb electron spin polarization, ⟨PRb⟩, resulting from greater optical density and
poorer overall Rb illumination, because %Pmax = ⟨PRb⟩γSE(γSE + ΓXe)−1. Attempting SEOP at higher temperatures (even as low as 75 °C)
resulted in full Rb runaway,12,25,29,30 an unstable and hysteretic condition
that requires the cell to be returned to room temperature before restarting
SEOP (and that must be diligently avoided—particularly when
setting conditions for automation). It should also be pointed out
that the Rb runaway is ultimately the result of insufficient OP-cell
thermal management. Engineering solutions have been proposed recently
to alleviate this problem.29 In principle,
it may also be possible to improve thermal management by the addition
of more thermally conductive gases like He.30,31 Thus, improved thermal management (e.g., ref (29)) could potentially allow
for (stable) SEOP at even higher temperatures with higher buildup
rates—to be better exploited for the early stage of the of
the temperature ramp (improvements in thermal management may also
allow for increases in resonant laser flux).20

a Residual Rb
content is reported
as a function of OP-cell surface temperature based on the elemental
analysis of an ∼1.0 L Tedlar bag containing ∼0.8 L of
HP gas mixture after the transfer from the OP-cell through Teflon
tubing with an in-line filter without cryocollection. Rb content obtained
on the presented setup with a thermoelectric cooling (TEC) oven (ref (15)) utilized 1/8 in. o.d.
(1/16 in. i.d.) Teflon tubing transfer lines with the temperature
sensor mounted on the outer surface of the OP-cell. Residual Rb content
obtained with the “open-source” hyperpolarizer with
a forced air (FA) oven utilized 1/4 in. o.d. (1/8 in. i.d.) Teflon
tubing transfer lines with the temperature sensor monitoring oven
air temperature (refs (14 and 19)).

b Ref (14).

Looking to the next phase of the HP 129Xe preparation
cycle, implementation of the XEUS cool-down procedure used for the
72–55 °C transition resulted in 9.6 ± 0.5% absolute
polarization loss (i.e., %PXe decrease
from 82.4% to 74.5%) in ∼12 min, whereas the 72–42 °C
transition resulted in 14.1 ± 0.7% absolute polarization loss
(%PXe decrease from 84.6% to 72.5%) in
∼24 min. Once the OP-cell reached 55 and 42 °C, the time
constants for 129Xe polarization decay were 184 ±
22 and 226 ± 12 min, respectively, further confirming that polarization
losses under these conditions are relatively minor (and that [Rb]
must be correspondingly low). Indeed, these decay constants are comparable
to the 129Xe T1 value of 227.2
± 4.2 min (or 3.78 ± 0.07 h) measured at 20 °C with
the laser off (Figure 4b). A long cell T1 (compared to γSE–1) is highly desirable for stopped-flow HP 129Xe production
because it enables PXe to approach ⟨PRb⟩. This T1 value is significantly longer than that previously reported for
this polarizer (∼2.5 h for 1000 Torr Xe with 1000 Torr N2),20 and nearly twice as long than
that previously reported for XeNA (T1 =
1.9 ± 0.6 h).14 This result is partially
due to the lower Xe density;32 however,
other contributions to achieving longer in-cell 129Xe T1 may include improvements in consistency of
OP-cell preparation and lower operational temperatures that minimize
wear and tear of Surfrasil OP-cell surface protection layers.

Automated gas transfer of HP 129Xe to a Tedlar bag following
OP-cell cool-down to 42 °C allowed the residual Rb level to be
measured—1.64 ng/0.8 L dose (Table 1). However, the time needed to reach this temperature during the
cooling stage is long (∼24 min) and doing so requires the laser
to be tuned (∼0.3 nm) off resonance to reduce the amount of
energy absorbed by the cell. Cooling to 55 °C takes half the
time and was performed without adjusting the laser from its nominal
SEOP settings, providing three advantages: (i) maintaining maximum
resonant photon flux helps minimize PXe losses during cooling, (ii) it removes the instrument idle time
(∼10 min) that would otherwise be required to return the laser
to nominal SEOP operating conditions, and (iii) it simplifies operation/automation.
Importantly, the residual Rb content remained acceptable using this
approach (3.4 ng/0.8 L dose). Indeed, the ratio of values for residual
Rb content correlates well with the expected Rb vapor density versus
temperature,28 and the values are also
similar to those obtained with the previous polarizer design and cell
cooling procedure (Table 1).

Given the
above results separately demonstrating optimal conditions
for fast PXe buildup, highest %Pmax, and low residual Rb content (Figure 1b), a combined TR-SEOP approach was investigated
(Figure 3). 129Xe was first polarized
for 12 min (∼1/γSEOP) at the highest allowed
temperature (74 °C, the highest temperature that was sufficiently
stable for automation over short periods), after which the temperature
was ramped down to the value at which the highest 129Xe
polarization was achieved (72 °C, reached in ∼9 min).
Despite the temperature change, the time course data could still be
reproduced by a simple exponential—giving an effective “average”
buildup rate ⟨γSEOP⟩ = (62.5 ±
3.7) × 10–3 min–1 and corresponding
effective maximum PXe value of ⟨%Pmax⟩ = 88.0 ± 0.9% (Table 1). Importantly, this effective buildup rate was
near the peak value achieved at 74 °C [(77.8 ± 4.0) ×
10–3 min–1], and over twice that
obtained at 72 °C [(29.9 ± 1.2) × 10–3 min–1]. Moreover, the corresponding effective
⟨%Pmax⟩ value for the TR-SEOP
experiment very nearly matched the peak value achieved at 72 °C
(90.1 ± 0.8%). While the %Pmax gain
over constant-temperature SEOP value obtained at 74 °C (85.1
± 0.9%) was modest, this is in part because 129Xe
polarization levels are already near unity. Larger relative gains
are expected for greater Xe densities where 129Xe polarization
levels tend to be lower,14,20,32 with a greater disparity between values obtained at higher temperatures
(with greater γSEOP) and those obtained at lower
temperatures (with higher %Pmax values
but much longer buildup times)—and where the risks of unstable
SEOP and Rb runaway are greater (because of faster Rb electronic spin-destruction
rates,33,34 greater laser absorption and hence energy
deposition within the cell,30 and lower
gas thermal conductivity31). Indeed, these
differences are likely to be even more pronounced with the development
of better thermal management approaches29 to allow higher temperatures at the beginning of the TR-SEOP process,
providing a route to further gains in accelerating the HP 129Xe production cycle.

We note that the actual cool-down times
were less than 12 and 24
min for 72–55 °C and 72–42 °C transitions,
respectively. Moreover, better thermal management, i.e., engineering
solutions allowing for faster OP-cell cool-down and heating, can further
reduce the cool-down time, and relatively small polarization losses
during cool-down demonstrated here can be further minimized. Furthermore,
reducing cool-down time will also positively decrease the HP 129Xe production cycle time, and increase the effective HP 129Xe production rate (L/h).

The presented batch-mode
TR-SEOP method operated in three temperature
regimes, and the method can be potentially further improved by circumventing
experimental hardware limitations (e.g., a more powerful TEC module
to enable faster temperature change, particularly important during
the cool-down phase) as well as by implementing more advanced temperature
ramping during SEOP. For example, as pointed out by an anonymous reviewer,
one way to consider the general approach is to maximize d%P/dt by derivation and implementation of
a temperature variation function comprising optimal temperature choices
for each moment over the course of the SEOP run for a given set of
conditions—which can be enabled by careful %Pmax mapping of SEOP parameters20 as well as characterization and improvement of the polarizer components
used to heat and cool the cell. In any case, detailed modeling and experimental implementation of
such optimization of the time-dependent SEOP is the subject of ongoing
work.

While the fractional concentration of hyperpolarized xenon
was
relatively low, i.e., ∼200 mL in ∼800 mL of ejected
hyperpolarized Xe/N2 gas mixture, the apparent 129Xe polarization %Papp27 (typically defined as noble gas polarization multiplied
by its fractional concentration) was still sufficiently high, i.e.,
%Papp ∼ 19%, after gas transfer
from the OP-cell into a Tedlar bag. Such levels of %Papp of ∼0.8–1
L hyperpolarized gas mixtures using 129Xe have been shown
sufficient for 3D human lung imaging.14,35,36

Conclusions
Taken together, the
above improvements in operation and design
can provide significant increases in production capacity for stop-flow
SEOP hyperpolarizers, without sacrificing the high level of nuclear
spin polarization achieved. First, the TR-SEOP approach provided near-unity
(88.0 ± 0.9%) %PXe at 500 Torr Xe
in 0.5 L clinical-scale OP-cell under conditions of stable automation—corresponding
to NMR/MRI enhancements of ∼3.1 × 105 and ∼2.3
× 108 at 3 T and 4 mT, respectively (fields relevant
to clinical imaging and current in situ detection)—with over
twice the buildup rate of the corresponding constant-temperature operation.
Next, the features provided by the positive-pressure manifold and
the cell cooling approach help to minimize the instrument idling time
by cutting the delay required for cell cooling in half (for the current
TEC-cooled design) and eliminating the delays otherwise required for
gas-line evacuation/purge cycles, gas mixing, and returning the laser
to nominal SEOP operation. Indeed, these improvements contribute to
a shortened and greatly simplified polarization cycle (comprising
only four steps, Figure 5) that lends itself
well to automated, looped operation for continuous production of batches
of HP 129Xe for a wide range of preclinical and clinical
applications. Using 2/⟨γSEOP⟩ as the
effective pumping time20 and ∼15
min as the overall cooling/idle time, the current hyperpolarizer in
TR-SEOP mode produces >1 L/h with near-unity 129Xe polarization
using the current 25:75 Xe/N2 gas mixture (with %Papp ∼ 19%)—with residual Rb remaining
within acceptable limits for clinical use (<5 ng/0.8 L dose). Although
the absence of cryocollection leads to 4-fold dilution of the HP 129Xe, corresponding speed gains in HP 129Xe production
are also expected with richer Xe mixtures—the subject of future
efforts. Finally, while the present work concerns only HP 129Xe, these results should also be readily applicable to improved production
of HP quadrupolar noble gas isotopes (83Kr and 131Xe).37−39
