Electrokinetic preconcentration coupled
with mobility shift assays
can give rise to very high detection sensitivities. We describe a
microfluidic device that utilizes this principle to detect cellular
kinase activities by simultaneously concentrating and separating substrate
peptides with different phosphorylation states. This platform is capable
of reliably measuring kinase activities of single adherent cells cultured
in nanoliter volume microwells. We also describe a novel method utilizing
spacer peptides that significantly increase separation resolution
while maintaining high concentration factors in this device. Thus,
multiplexed kinase measurements can be implemented with single cell
sensitivity. Multiple kinase activity profiling from single cell lysate
could potentially allow us to study heterogeneous activation of signaling
pathways that can lead to multiple cell fates.

==== Body
Kinases are
an important family
of proteins that regulate the majority of cell signaling pathways.
They transmit information by catalyzing the phosphorylation of a specific
substrate, thus modulating its activity. Interactions of multiple
kinases in the signal transduction network lead to different outcomes
in response to stimuli, which affects cell fate. Due to their importance
in cell decision processing, there is tremendous interest in measuring
cellular kinase activity levels.

Recent studies have found that
many anticancer drugs kill most
but not all the cells in a tumor, often resulting in relapse of cancer.1,2 It has been proposed that nongenetic cell-to-cell variability in
protein activity, among other things, lead to this different response
to drugs.1 As most conventional techniques
provide only a population-averaged measurement of the signals within
the regulatory pathway, they do not reflect an accurate picture of
a heterogeneous population of cells being in different states of intracellular
processing.3−5 Analysis of the overall changes in phosphorylation
of population of cells may also miss cellular subpopulations that
are in different signaling states due to the asynchronous nature of
the response.6

To address the issues
related to cellular heterogeneity in signal
transduction, one would need measurements of various kinase activities
at the single cell level. Microfluidic systems provide great potential
and promise for analyzing single cell molecular content with an unparalleled
speed, accuracy and throughput. Confinement in microchambers has been
shown to increase the effective concentrations of target biomolecules
and enable ultrasensitive detection of intracellular proteins from
single cells.7,8 However, these methods require
cells to be detached into suspension prior to analysis, an event which
could activate many signaling pathways and perturb the biochemical
process to be studied. Another major drawback of these assays is that
adherent phenotypes such as morphology, and individual cell migration
behaviors cannot be correlated with their biological activities. Furthermore,
these methods rely on either special fluoregenic substrates8 that cannot be used for multiplexed detection
or phosphospecific antibody methods7 that
do not necessarily reflect the actual enzyme activity.

A more
accurate approach that would provide crucial information
about the kinetics and state of the signal transduction network is
the direct kinase activity assay, which measures the ability of kinases
to catalyze phosphorylation of a target protein or peptide. Currently,
the most advanced methods for single cell kinase activity measurement
involve imaging live cells that are genetically encoded for a substrate
molecule that can report the activity changes within the cytoplasm.9,10 These live-cell imaging methods could yield spatiotemporal information
about kinase activation; however, they are limited in the number and
types of enzymes that can be measured simultaneously in single cells.
In addition, expressing a reporter molecule involves laborious genetic
engineering of a cell line to encode a fluorescent protein, and could
alter the normal function of the cell. An alternative strategy that
has been developed involves microinjecting fluorescent kinase substrates
into single cells, lysing them and performing capillary electrophoresis
(CE) to separate and quantify the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
substrates.11−13 It is possible to perform simultaneous measurements
of several enzymes within the same cell due to the separation capability
of CE. In both kinase activity assays described above, substrate specificity
is an issue because there is significant substrate cross-reactivity
among intracellular kinases. In addition, intracellular kinase substrate
reporters could be subjected to other cellular processes such as proteolysis
and dephosphorylation during intracellular kinase reaction,11 thus obfuscating the actual activity of the
target kinase. Very recently, it is demonstrated that a microfluidic
probe can lyse single adherent cells and capture the contents to perform
single-cell kinase activity assay.14 This
device is readily applicable to existing cells on a standard tissue
culture plate; however, it remains a challenge to scale up for high
throughput, multiplex single cell kinase activity measurements.

Apart from cell handling, novel phenomena in microfluidics have
been exploited to enable ultrasensitive detection modalities. We have
previously described a concentration-enhanced mobility shift platform
in a microfluidic device that can amplify signals in homogeneous electrophoretic
assays.15 Here we report that this platform
can be applied to simultaneously measure multiple kinase activities
from single adherent cells. The increased sensitivity of the concentration-enhanced
mobility shift platform allows for detection of kinase activities
from single cell lysate even upon dilution into a much larger reaction
chamber. The strength of this platform include: (1) the ability to
directly measure kinase activities from adherent cells without detaching
them (2) improved reaction specificity by addition of off-target kinase
inhibitors and various protease and phosphatase inhibitors to the
lysate (3) do not require microinjection or genetic modification,
and (4) ability to simultaneously measure several kinase activities
within the same cell. We expect the platform that we described to
be an important tool that would complement the existing single cell
kinase assay methods.

Experimental Section
Details of
the microchip operation, peptide synthesis and buffer
recipes are included in the Supporting Information.

Recombinant Kinase Activity Assays
Varying concentrations
of 0.5 μL recombinant kinase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was
mixed with 4.5 μL of the premixed assay buffer (Buffer A supplemented
with 1 μM substrate, please refer to the Supporting Information for buffer recipes) and incubated at
room temperature for 60 min. After 1 h of incubation, 1 μL of
the reaction mixture was diluted in 99 μL of Buffer B and 30
μL of this final sample was loaded into each sample reservoir
of the microfluidic device. The results of the assay were taken at
the end of 15 min of electrokinetic concentration. Substrate cross-reactivity
measurements were performed as described in the Supporting Information.

Bulk Cell Lysate Kinase
Activity Assays
Bulk cell lysate
was prepared as described in the Supporting Information. Assay buffer (Buffer C with 4 μM PKC inhibitor, 4 μM
calmidazolium, 1 μM fluorescent substrate peptide, 1 mM DTT;
for Akt and MK2, 0.4 μM PKI-tide, 5 μM GF109203X; for
PKA, 5 μM GF109203X) was prepared in bulk and 18 μL volumes
were aliquoted into separate microcentrifuge tubes. To begin each
reaction, 10% (v/v) lysis buffer (Buffer D) or lysate (diluted in
lysis buffer to stated concentrations) was added and the contents
were mixed gently. Reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min.
After that, reaction was stopped by diluting 1 μL of this mixture
in 99 μL of Buffer B. Thirty microliters of this final sample
was used for the concentration-enhanced mobility shift assay.

Single
Cell Culture and Kinase Assay
Single adherent
HepG2 cells were isolated and grown in custom-made cell culture chambers
defined by silicone gasket wells on coverglass (internal volume =
40 nL). Single cells confined in the sealed nanoliter size microwells
were ultrasonically lysed in a water bath so that the released intracellular
kinases can catalyze phosphorylation of peptide substrates that were
preadded to the microwells just before lysis. The kinase reaction
product from each of the 40 nL chambers were individually retrieved,
diluted, and used for concentration-enhanced mobility shift assay.
Please refer to Figure 3a and the Supporting Information for the detailed protocol.

Results and Discussion
Concentration-Enhanced Mobility Shift Assay
Figure 1 describes the key operation of
the poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) microfluidic electrokinetic concentration chip.15 The chip consists of two microchannels bridged
by a Nafion ion selective membrane that is only permeable to positive
ions. The top microchannel and bottom microchannel are prefilled with
sample solution and buffer solution, respectively. Under the voltage
configuration shown in Figure 1a, positive
ions from the sample channel at the vicinity of the Nafion membrane
migrate to the buffer channel but the negative ions from the buffer
channel are prevented from migrating to the sample channel. As a result,
an ion depletion zone is created in the sample channel near the ion
selective membrane. The conductivity gradient at the boundary of the
ion depletion zone gives rise to a stable electric field gradient
that can effectively focus negatively charged biomolecules at separate
locations where electrophoretic velocity balances bulk flow velocity.15 In this work, fluorescently labeled peptides
that contained the recognition sequences for specific kinases are
used as substrates. Target kinases in the sample catalyze the phosphorylation
of these peptides, leading to an increase in electrophoretic mobility.
Phosphorylated peptides, which have a higher electrophoretic mobility
due to the negative-charged phosphoryl group, are concentrated at
the low electric field region. On the other hand, unphosphorylated
peptides have a lower mobility; therefore, they concentrate nearer
to the cation selective membrane where the electric field is higher
(Figure 1b). In this manner, we can obtain
good separation between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrates,
while at the same time achieve continuous signal enhancement for greater
sensitivity.

Figure 1 (a) Ion selective membrane creates a local ion depletion
zone with
high electric field upon applying a voltage. (b) Unphosphorylated
and phosphorylated peptide substrates are different in terms of their
electrophoretic mobilities (additional charge), therefore they continuously
concentrate at different locations in the electrokinetic concentration
device where the peptide electric force balance the electroosmotic
flow, (c) With increasing recombinant Akt concentration, the fluorescence
intensity of the phosphorylated substrate peak increases while the
fluorescence intensity of the unphosphorylated substrate peak decreases.

The microfluidics platform demonstrated
in this paper has several
advantages in this application compared to other techniques that combine
preconcentration and separation. Previous reports have established
that this platform is capable of achieving very high preconcentration
factors (million fold),16 and has been
successfully used in many biological assays including enhancing protein
binding kinetics,17 improving sensitivity
of enzyme assays,18−20 and reducing the limit of detection of mobility shift
assays.15 Unlike other techniques such
as transient isotachophoresis21 and temperature
gradient focusing,22 this method does not
require multiple buffer setup or temperature sensitive buffer. A major
advantage of this platform is the ability to continuously concentrate
and separate the peptide substrates from the entire sample channel
over the experiment duration, leading to increasing detection sensitivity
with time.

Development of Recombinant Kinase Activity
Assay
We
first performed an experiment with recombinant Akt and its fluorescent
peptide substrate Crosstide (5-FAM-GRPRTSSFAEG). Recombinant enzyme
assays were conducted as described in the Experimental
Section. As shown in Figure 1c, two
distinct bands corresponding to the phosphorylated (left) and unphosphorylated
substrate (right) were formed in each sample channel during 15 min
of preconcentration. The fluorescence intensities of these bands increased
linearly with time. The fraction of phosphorylated substrate for each
sample can be extracted by dividing the total fluorescence intensity
of the phosphorylated substrate band by the total fluorescence intensity
of both bands. The average kinase reaction rate can be directly calculated
from these multiplexed measurements without any need for calibrations.
There could be variations in the exact locations of the substrate
bands as they depend on a delicate balance of hydrostatic pressure,
electric field, position and condition of the nafion membrane as well
as electroosmotic flow due to microchannel surface. However, because
the assay is ratiometric, variation in band position and external
influences such as light intensity do not affect calculation of the
phosphorylation fraction. Figure 2a showed
a dose response curve for the recombinant Akt assay. The limit of
detection (LOD) for recombinant Akt was calculated to be 1 ng/mL (16.9
pM).

Figure 2 (a) Dose response curve for recombinant Akt, MK2 and PKA activity
assay. The limits of detection are 1, 1.2 and 0.7 ng/mL, respectively.
(b) Dose response curves showing upregulation of Akt activity by insulin
and upregulation of PKA activity by forskolin (25 μM, 30 min).
Plotted values indicate the mean ± s.e.m. for duplicate measurements.

To demonstrate the general applicability
of this assay, separate
experiments were performed with recombinant MK2 and PKA with their
respective fluorescent peptide substrates, MK2tide and Kemptide (MK2:
5-FAM-AHLQRQLSIA, PKA: 5-FAM-LRRASLG). Except for new substrates,
the recombinant MK2 and PKA assay was done with the same conditions
as the recombinant Akt experiment. From the dose response curve in
Figure 2a, the LODs for recombinant MK2 and
PKA were 1.2 ng/mL (24.5 pM) and 0.7 ng/mL (16 pM), respectively,
within 15 min of electrokinetic concentration.

To qualitatively
assess the substrate specificity of our kinase
of interest, the pairwise cross-reactivity between each substrate
and kinase was measured as described in the Supporting
Information. From Figure S1 (Supporting
Information), the degree of substrate phosphorylation is greatest
when a kinase reacts with its target substrate (Kemptide for PKA,
Crosstide for Akt, MK2tide for MK2). However, this assay also detected
a small amount (<10%) of off-target phosphorylation.

Due
to the reduced specificity in using short peptides instead
of full-length protein as kinase activity probes,23 it is important to implement strategies to prevent interfering
cross-reactive kinases from phosphorylating the target substrate.
Off-target kinase reactivity could present an accuracy problem when
measuring specific kinase activities in complex samples such as crude
cell lysate. Furthermore, the presence of other intracellular enzymes
such as proteases and phosphatase could affect the stability and phosphorylation
state of the substrates. This is one major limitation of many existing
single cell kinase activity assays, where substrates that are microinjected
into or expressed within the cell are subjected to the activity of
other intracellular enzymes such as off-target kinases, proteases
and phosphatases.

Immunoprecipitation–kinase assays offers
a highly specific
way to measure activity from only the target kinase, but it is challenging
to apply to single cell lysate assay due to the limited amount of
sample available. For single cell lysate assay, a more easily implemented
strategy to improve specificity is to include a customized inhibitor
cocktail of off-target kinases, proteases and phosphatases to the
reaction buffer in order to minimize the effects of interfering enzymes.
This strategy has been shown to effectively suppress the activity
of the interfering enzymes without affecting the activity of the kinase
of interest,24−26 and is routinely applied in commercial cell lysate
kinase activity assays (Omnia (Life Technologies) and Upstate (Millipore)
Kinase Assay Kits). In our subsequent experiments using bulk cell
lysate and single cells, a cocktail of previously verified protease,
phosphatase and off-target kinase inhibitors was added to improve
the assay specificity. The protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
was used at the recommended concentration for bulk cell lysis, and
has been shown to provide adequate protection in capillary electrophoresis
based cell lysate kinase activity assay.27 The kinase inhibitor cocktail used in this paper was adapted from
previous work24 that showed that this inhibitor
combination significantly improves specificity (reduce nonspecific
phosphorylation by interfering kinases by 75%) and does not inhibit
the kinase that is being assayed for. An immunodepletion experiment
from the same report24 also showed that
any substrate phosphorylation observed is predominantly due to the
specific activity of the target kinase. Potential users interested
in implementing this strategy to improve specificity would need to
perform the necessary biochemical assays to determine the suitable
inhibitor concentrations to be included in their assay to minimize
off-target contributions from endogeneous kinases.

Kinase Activity
Assay from Bulk Cell Lysate
To show
the application of this assay with physiological samples, the kinase
activity experiments were repeated with diluted HepG2 cell lysate.
The procedures for bulk cell lysate activity assay are described in
the Experimental Section. Insulin stimulation
is known to increase the activity of Akt in vivo. A comparison between
the activity of serum starved HepG2 cell lysate and insulin stimulated
HepG2 cell lysate is show in Figure S2 (Supporting
Information). No phosphorylated substrate band was observed
for the negative control samples (containing lysis buffer only). For
the same final cell lysate concentration (down to the lowest tested
concentration of 2.16 μg/mL), the insulin stimulated sample
consistently showed a higher fraction of phosphorylated substrate
compared to the serum starved sample, confirming the utility of our
assay to measure changes in cellular kinase activities in response
to stimuli (Figure 2b). The cells used in this
experiment have about 1 ng of protein per cell (Lysis of ∼400 000
HepG2 cells resulted in recovery of 360 μg of total protein).
Detection from a final volume of 30 μL run buffer, after a total
of 100-fold dilution of a 2.16 μg/mL of cell lysate, represents
kinase assay from ∼0.6 cell. This demonstrates the sensitivity
of our assay for single cell level studies of cell signaling pathways.

In another experiment, we measured the effect of forskolin stimulation,
which is known to increase the intracellular level of cAMP and upregulate
PKA activity. Figure 2b shows that the forskolin
stimulated sample consistently showed a higher fraction of phosphorylated
PKA substrate compared to the serum starved sample. This shows that
our platform can be generally applied to measure activities of different
kinases with high sensitivity from physiological samples.

Kinase Activity
Assay from Single Cell Lysate
Most
mammalian cells are adherent cells, and need some types of matrices
for growth. Although cell handling and various operations such as
lysis have been demonstrated on suspension cells or detached adherent
cells,28−31 they are considerably more challenging for adherent cells. Our assay
is designed to be compatible with current methods of cell culture,
keeping to biocompatible materials such as polystyrene, glass, silicone
and avoiding complicated fluidic handling systems such as growing
cells in enclosed microfluidic channels.

We developed a technique
to grow single cells in open, nanoliter size microwells, as described
in the Experimental Section (Figure 3a). Single cells are
ultrasonically lysed in 40 nL chambers (Figure S4, Supporting Information), so that the released intracellular
kinases can catalyze phosphorylation of peptide substrates that we
preadded to the wells just before lysis. Because the enzymes and substrates
are confined in nanoliter sized chambers preventing further dilution,
they are at effective concentrations that allow a significant fraction
of peptide substrate to be phosphorylated and detected. A previous
report estimated that there are ∼106 downstream
kinase molecules in a single cell.32 On
the basis of this estimate, the effective concentration of kinase
molecules after lysis is 41.6 pM, which is above the limit of detection
for recombinant kinases determined in this platform. This approach
is parallel to many recent works that make use of microfluidic confinement
to maintain high effective concentrations of target biomolecules and
enable ultrasensitive detection.33−35 The confinement effect
prevents further sample and substrate dilution into the entire cell
culture plate. Additionally, the microfluidics concentration-enhanced
mobility shift assay platform allows assays that lost sensitivity
due to process steps that lead to sample dilution (such as addition
of reagent or cell lysis in a larger volume) to regain analytical
sensitivity by concentrating the analyte. One advantage of our approach,
compared to many existing single cell kinase activity assay, is that
various inhibitors (for off-target kinase, protease, phosphatase)
can be added in the reaction buffer to increase specificity, reduce
cross-talk, maintain stability and preserve phosphorylation states
in the kinase assay. Adding these inhibitors to cell lysate as opposed
to incubating cells with cell-permeable inhibitors have the distinct
advantage of avoiding perturbation of other signaling pathways in
a live cell via off-target inhibition or cross-pathway effects.36,37 In addition, simply scaling up the number of microwells would enable
a high throughput (yet single cell level) kinase assay.

Figure 3 Demonstration
of single cell concentration-enhanced kinase activity
assay. (a) Procedures for single cell culture, lysis and kinase reaction.
Individual cells are isolated and cultured in individual open microwells
(∼40 nL) for microscopic observation. For kinase assay, buffer
in the wells is replaced with kinase assay buffer, sealed with a Kapton
tape, and the cells are ultrasonically lysed. After incubation, to
allow kinase reaction, the reaction product is diluted into larger
volumes and loaded into the microflluidic device for readout. (b)
Detection of 0 vs 1 cell Akt activities from different microwells.
Measured activity signals (marked by arrows) can be clearly differentiated
between 0 and 1 cell cases. (c) MK2 activity vs cell number after
normalizing by the average cell volume. Different numbers of cells
have significantly different normalized kinase activities by Student’s
two-tailed t-test, demonstrating that this assay
has both single cell sensitivity and resolution.

Figure 3b shows the results of single
cell
lysate kinase activity assay using Akt as a substrate (PKC and PKA
inhibitors added to improve substrate specificity without affecting
Akt activity24). In the samples corresponding
to wells with no cells (negative controls), we see only one band corresponding
to the unphosphorylated Akt substrate. On the other hand, in samples
corresponding to wells containing one cell, we see two fluorescent
bands corresponding to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Akt
substrate. These results show conclusively that our assay can detect
Akt kinase activity from single cell lysate.

One additional
capability of our device is that it is possible
to look at total kinase activity from multiple cells growing in the
same well. Figure 3d shows the results of single,
double and triple cells kinase activity assay using MK2 as a substrate.
There is a clear trend indicating that total kinase activity increases
with the total number of cells in the well. The measure for kinase
activity, which is the substrate phosphorylation ratio, is nonzero
even in wells with no cells as the image analysis algorithm identifies
spurious noise in the image as a phosphorylated peak; this indicates
the baseline sensitivity of the method. We observed that there are
some outlier points in the activity distribution. Upon reference with
the cell image taken before cell lysis, we find that these high kinase
activities correlate with larger cell size (Figure S5, Supporting Information). This highlights the
ability to correlate single cell phenotype (e.g., morphology, size)
with cellular kinase activity in our method.

Tracking Multiple Kinase
Activities Simultaneously
In studies related to the signal
transduction network, investigators
are often interested in understanding the functional relationship
between activities of different kinases in the network. By measuring
and comparing kinase activities between different signaling pathways,
one could deduce how the different stimuli are integrated to produce
different cellular responses. Currently, phospho-flow cytometry38 and mass cytometry39 have high degrees of multiplexing capability to measure signaling
states, but would not detect small molecule binding and multiple other
post-translational modification states that could potentially affect
kinase activity. With the exception of the single cell capillary electrophoresis
method,11 most current single cell kinase
activity assays lack the capability of looking at more than one kinase
activity at a time.

Electrophoretic separation methods such
as capillary electrophoresis are powerful because they enable simultaneous
measurements of several kinase activities by separating substrates
of different mobility. In the previously demonstrated concentration-enhanced
mobility shift assay,15 the sharp electric
field gradient is essential to obtaining very high concentration factors
but the same phenomenon also reduces the separation resolution. To
obtain good separation for multiplexed kinase detection while maintaining
high concentration factors for sensitivity enhancement, a staircase-like
electric field profile, as shown in Figure 4a, is preferred. This profile is desirable because the electric field
plateau can increase the separation resolution between target analytes
while the individual analytes can still narrowly focus at local regions
where the electric field gradient is steep. This can be achieved by
concentrating various intermediate mobility species to such high concentrations
that it is capable of changing the electric field profile according
to the Kohlraush Regulating Function (KRF), as is commonly observed
in isotachophoresis (ITP) experiments.40−42

Figure 4 (a) Schematic showing
a strategy to simultaneously separate and
focus multiple kinase substrates. Upon adding suitable spacer molecules
with intermediate mobilities at various concentrations, depletion
zone isotachophoresis40 results in a staircase-like
electric field profile that increases the separation resolution between
multiple kinase substrates. (b) Compounds in the ampholyte stack in
the order of their mobilities to create an extended separation zone
where the equilibrium focusing position of individual fluorescent
an analytes are well resolved. (c) Simultaneous detection of three
kinase activities (Akt, MK2 and PKA) in a single experiment. Within
a single run, one can measure the activities of three kinases by separating
their substrates (AKTtide, MK2tide and PKAtide) from their phosphorylated
products (pAKTtide, pMK2tide and pPKAtide) using synthetic peptide
spacers. (d) Concentration-enhanced multiple kinase activity assay
(for MK2 and PKA) of single and multiple adherent cells.

To provide a combination of intermediate mobility
spacers, an ampholyte
mixture can be used. When subjected to electric field, carrier ampholyte
molecules focus at their equilibrium position, thus forming continuous
bands of ampholyte species arranged in order of high mobility to low
mobility as it approaches the ion-selective membrane (Figure 4b). The focusing of nonfluorescent ampholyte species
in between fluorescent peptides with different mobility increases
their separation resolution. However, due to the unknown identities
of these proprietary carrier ampholyte molecules, it is difficult
to arbitrarily increase the separation resolution between two closely
spaced fluorescent peptides or decrease the distance between two distantly
spaced fluorescent peptides. As an alternative to ampholytes, custom
synthetic peptides can be obtained at low cost and high purity, and
their mobility can be tailored by adding different amino acids (with
various charge and molecular weight) during peptide synthesis. The
mobilities of the peptide substrates and spacers can be approximated
with the Offord Model43,44 μ = Q/M2/3 where μ = electrophoretic mobility, Q = total charge and M = total mass of
the peptide.

Table S1 and Figure S1 (Supporting
Information) show the predicted mobility values of 12 synthetic
spacer peptides
placed alongside the predicted mobility values of the kinase peptide
substrates. Peptides with mobility in-between kinase substrates or
phosphorylated products that we wish to resolve can be chosen as spacers.
Figure 4c shows that, by rationally choosing
the appropriate peptide spacers, we can simultaneously concentrate
and baseline-resolve substrates and products corresponding to three
kinases PKA (substrate: 5-FAM-EELGRTGRRNSI), Akt (substrate: 5-FAM-GRPRTSSFAEG-NH2) and MK2 (substrate: FITC-EEKKLNRTLSVA). This general capability
would allow us to simultaneously monitor several (up to three in this
study) kinase activities from the same sample and study their functional
relationship to yield insights on the inner-workings of cell regulatory
pathways. We also demonstrated that such multiplexed measurement (two
targets, PKA and MK2) can be implemented with single cell sensitivity
(Figure 4d). One point to take note is that
simultaneous preconcentration of an increasing number of spacer peptides
would reduce electric field gradients and therefore reduce electrokinetic
preconcentration factors in multiplexed assays. The current experimental
setup is sensitive enough to measure activities from two kinases from
single cell. At higher applied voltages needed for high degrees of
multiplexing, preconcentration bands in the current device are less
stable over extended amounts of assay time needed to achieve single
cell detection sensitivity. As such, more device and material optimization
is needed to perform simultaneous activity assay for three or more
different kinases from a single cell.

Conclusions
The
presented method fills several gaps in the existing single
cell kinase assay. Conventional immunohistochemical staining of single
cells with phosphospecific antibodies38 has been widely used to monitor the localization of kinases in fixed
cells, but the phosphorylation state of kinases does not always correlate
to their biological activity, especially in the presence of other
post-translational modifications, protein–protein association
and drug interactions. We focus instead on directly measuring kinase
activity on a target substrate, which captures the actual catalytic
activity of specific kinase from single cell at the point of lysis.
This is, in effect, a single cell resolution version of traditional
cell lysate based kinase activity assay, where the cells are lysed
prior to kinase activity assay. The cell is first rapidly lysed in
this method, preserving a snapshot of the cell signaling state. As
the intracellular contents of a single cell (pL volume) is then diluted
into a nanoliter sized chamber, the ultrasensitive assay provided
by the concentration-enhanced mobility shift assay platform is an
enabling technology that allows detection of this low-abundance kinase
activity. This method allows various inhibitors (for off-target kinase,
protease, phosphatase) to be added to the lysate to improve specificity,
reduce cross-talk, maintain stability and preserve phosphorylation
states in the kinase assay, thus avoiding the complications of activating
unintended cellular responses associated with incubating live cells
with these inhibitors. The throughput of this platform is also scalable
as all the key steps can process multiple samples in parallel. Kinase
reactions are carried out in multiple chambers simultaneously; the
reaction product can be frozen and analyzed at a later time. The multiplexing
capability of the microfluidics chip can be further extended to process
up to 128 samples in parallel, as demonstrated in a previous report.45

For biological studies of signal transduction
pathway, it is important
to assay for kinase activity with minimal disruption to their natural
environment. Detaching and putting adherent cells into suspension,
as required for flow cytometry methods, could activate many signaling
pathways and seriously perturb the biochemical process to be studied.
Other single cell kinase activity assays such as those involving capillary
electrophoresis of injected substrates or genetically modified cells
that express a reporter molecule also involve considerable perturbation
to the normal physiology of the cells. The method reported here can
assay for kinase activities on adherent cells, and the cells are maintained
in their natural state until lysis. The rapid ultrasonic lysis method
demonstrated in this paper is a simple way to lyse cells, but might
not be suitable for stress responsive kinase measurement as the high
forces during sonication could affect cellular response. In those
cases, a more appropriate lysis method that is also compatible with
this platform is pulsed laser microbeam lysis46 that would lyse cells in milliseconds and minimize perturbation
to the cell signaling state.

Finally, the method developed here
enables simultaneous measurement
of multiple kinase activities within single cells. This general capability
could allow us to study the functional relationship between different
signaling pathways to yield insights on the inner-workings of cell
regulatory pathways. In most assays, very good specificity can be
obtained using optimized substrates and including inhibitors that
prevent cross-reactivity. For very promiscuous kinases, one could
potentially apply other strategies to control for any cross-reactivity
in multiplexed kinase activity measurements such as deconvolution
of signals using prior data on individual recombinant kinase signatures
for the substrate panel.47We believe that
this new platform could be a generic and powerful tool for diagnostics,
drug development and systems biology research.
