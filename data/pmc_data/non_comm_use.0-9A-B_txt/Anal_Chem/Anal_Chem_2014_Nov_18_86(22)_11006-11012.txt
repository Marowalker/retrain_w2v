Intact protein analysis via top-down
mass spectrometry (MS) provides
the unique capability of fully characterizing protein isoforms and
combinatorial post-translational modifications (PTMs) compared to
the bottom-up MS approach. Front-end protein separation poses a challenge
for analyzing complex mixtures of intact proteins on a proteomic scale.
Here we applied capillary electrophoresis (CE) through a sheathless
capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization (CESI) interface
coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer to profile the proteome
from Pyrococcus furiosus. CESI-top-down MS analysis
of Pyrococcus furiosus cell lysate identified 134
proteins and 291 proteoforms with a total sample consumption of 270
ng in 120 min of total analysis time. Truncations and various PTMs
were detected, including acetylation, disulfide bonds, oxidation,
glycosylation, and hypusine. This is the largest scale analysis of
intact proteins by CE-top-down MS to date.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based
proteomics has grown to become a major analytical tool for the study
of complex biological processes. The high-throughput bottom-up MS
approach, in which protein proteolytic digests are separated, analyzed,
and used to infer protein identity, is dominant in the proteomics
field due to the rapid development of peptide separation techniques,
as well as the advances in MS instrumentation and bioinformatic tools
tailored to peptide analysis. However, information pertaining to combinatorial
post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein splice variant
isoforms is often lost after proteolysis.1,2 Two
dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) is a protein separation technique
that has been used to investigate and identify splice variant isoforms
and PTMs.3−5 However, a major drawback of 2DE is sensitivity primarily
due to the sample quantity requirements of protein visualization methods
and losses associated with peptide/protein extraction from the gel.
Also, analyzing large numbers of gel spots obtained by 2DE can be
very time-consuming. Alternatively, the limitations of bottom-up MS
analysis can be overcome by the top-down MS approach, in which the
intact proteins are measured as a whole and fragmented directly in
the mass spectrometer. This technique has primarily been applied to
targeted analysis of single proteins or simple protein mixtures since
its initial introduction 2 decades ago.6−8 Very recently, with the
development of high-resolution MS instrumentation,9,10 front-end
separations,11−13 and top-down software,14−17 top-down analyses of various
organisms have been reported on a proteome scale.18−22 For example, Tran et al.21 identified 1043 proteins, including over 3000 proteoforms, from
HeLa S3 cells with a total analysis time of approximately 45 h using
a customized three-stage separation system. Ansong et al.22 reported the identification of 563 proteins
including 1665 proteoforms from Salmonella typhimurium with a single dimension ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography
(LC) separation that enabled the analysis of 5 μg of sample
in approximately 4 h. However, these studies still lag behind the
capabilities of bottom-up analyses by an order of magnitude in regard
to protein identification and require greater sample consumption.

New technological developments are needed to improve the sensitivity,
sequence coverage, throughput, and robustness of top-down MS characterization
of complex protein mixtures. One of the key challenges for top-down
proteomics is the lack of a high-efficiency and high-resolution intact
protein separation technique. Reverse phase liquid chromatography
(RPLC) is the method of choice for separations but has drawbacks when
applied to intact proteins, such as irreversible protein adsorption
to the stationary phase. Although recent advances11,12,23 with solution-based separation techniques
have facilitated the further development of top-down MS technologies,
the development of alternative techniques is still a necessary step
for the maturation of this discipline.

Capillary electrophoresis
(CE) has been recognized as a powerful
method for separating intact proteins, possessing advantages such
as high separation efficiency, short separation time, as well as low
sample consumption.24−27 Smith and co-workers have pioneered CE top-down proteomics by coupling
capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) to Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry for Escherichia coli proteome characterization.28 CIEF separates
proteins according to the differences in pI and normally
needs the addition of ampholytes for the generation of a pH gradient,
which can cause ion suppression and contamination in the MS signal.
In contrast, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is another attractive
CE mode which will generate much lower background noise, due to the
lack of ampholytes, and is much easier in system automation. CZE separates
analytes based on their mass to charge ratios and its separation efficiency
can be very high for proteins since they have relatively low diffusion
coefficients, thereby restricting band broadening. One of the main
reasons for the unpopularity of CE-MS relative to LC-MS is the difficulty
of online interfacing CE to ESI-MS. The sheath liquid interface29 is most widely used but it is always associated
with analyte dilution. Recently, two low-flow sheath liquid sprayers
have been designed independently by the Chen and Dovichi laboratories
to minimize band broadening and analyte dilution.27,30−32 The Dovichi group developed an electrokinetically
pumped low sheath-flow electrospray CE-MS interface and has shown
its application not only in bottom-up proteomics but also top-down
protein analysis. Other than model protein separation and Orbitrap
Velos detection for top-down demonstration,27 they recently also applied this platform for top-down analysis of
more complex biological samples,33 in which
the Mycobacterium marinum secretome was separated
by CZE and analyzed by Q-Exactive mass spectrometry via the electrokinetic
sheath-flow interface. They were able to identify 22 proteins in a
single 1-h analysis with a total sample consumption of 500 ng. The
Kelleher group also reported the use of the electrokinetically pumped
electrospray interface for Pseudomonas aeruginosa top-down analysis.34 They applied GELFrEE
as sample prefractionation followed by CZE-MS/MS analysis and were
able to identify 30 proteins in the mass range of 30–80 kDa.

Other efforts have focused on the development of sheathless CESI
interfaces, which completely eliminate the sheath liquid to maximize
electrospray sensitivity. One of the most attractive subsets is the
porous tip sheathless electrospray interface.35,36 This prototype interface has been recently evaluated by several
research groups and demonstrated highly sensitive proteomic analysis.37−40 Using this sheathless interface, the Lindner group39 demonstrated that CE-MS/MS is 10-fold more sensitive than
nLC-MS/MS for the analysis of histone H1 peptides. The Mayboroda group41 has applied transient ITP (tITP)-CZE-MS/MS for
sensitive glycopeptide characterization and found a 40-fold increase
in sensitivity for IgG1 Fc glycopeptide analysis when compared to
a conventional strategy. In addition to peptide level analysis, this
sheathless CESI interface has also been applied to the characterization
of intact proteins. Haselberg et al.42 showed that the detection limits of four model proteins improved
by a factor of 50–140 compared to the sheath-liquid interface;
more recently they also demonstrated the effectiveness and high sensitivity
in glycoform profiling of intact pharmaceutical proteins by CE-TOF
MS analysis.26

In this work, we coupled
CZE with an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer
through the prototype sheathless CESI interface for the top-down characterization
of the Pyrococcus furiosus proteome. Pyrococcus
furiosus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows optimally
at 100 °C. It has 1908 kilobases of DNA sequence and 2065 open
reading frames. The average molecular weight of all proteins in the Pyrococcus furiosus Uniprot database is 32 kDa. Pyrococcus furiosus has been established as a proteomics
standard43 due to its moderate complexity
and very little duplication within the genome. We applied the aforementioned
CE-MS platform to analyze these Pyrococcus furiosus proteins. After a failed initial attempt of separating the whole
lysate with CE, we decided to reduce the sample complexity by step
elution from a reverse phase separation. The resulting four fractions
were dried, redissolved in water, and then injected individually as
described in the Supporting Information, Experimental Section. We were able to solubilize these fractions
in water, without needing to add 70% acetic acid as reported by the
Dovichi group. We optimized the BGE buffer composition for effective
separation of Pyrococcus furiosus proteins and found
that 0.1% acetic acid with 20% IPA gave the best protein separation
and the most sensitive MS detection. As shown in Figure 1, about 90 ng injection of each Pyrococcus furiosus fraction yielded a unique electropherogram with a good signal-to-noise
ratio. All protein species came out within a 30 min separation window
with peak widths as short as 10 s. For this CE analysis, a 180 s injection
was used to increase the sample loading, which corresponds to a total
of 13 cm or 14% of the injection plug; this large sample plug will
introduce peak broadening in regular CE separation. In order to minimize
the peak broadening and increase the separation resolution, tITP was
used for sample stacking and preconcentration.

Figure 1 Electropherograms of
the Pyrococcus furiosus intact
proteins analyzed by CE-MS. 90 ng of RPLC step eluted fractions with
(A) 20% buffer B, (B) 40% buffer B, (C) 60% buffer B, and (D) 100%
buffer B were injected. CE separation conditions: PEI coated capillary;
voltage −30 kV; BGE 0.1% acetic acid, 20% IPA. Taking into
account the ∼30 min separation window, the average peak capacities
in parts A–C were calculated to be ∼120 (using the average
peak width at half peak height).

To conservatively estimate the number of detected protein
species
in each fraction, deconvoluted mass lists generated by Xtract were
further grouped with an in-house built program (Supporting Information, Experimental Section) to merge the
mass over different charge states and scans as well as to correct
isotope shifted assignments. Such analyses of the full scan FTMS spectra
revealed hundreds of unique protein masses in each fraction (Table 1) ranging from 2 kDa to 30 kDa with an average of
4.7 kDa. Interestingly the mass distribution is biased toward low
mass species (Figure 2). This could be due
to the decreased sensitivity for larger proteins with Orbitrap detection
as the numbers of charge states and isotopic peaks increase as MW
increases, and this could result in poorly resolved isotopic envelopes
to be deconvoluted readily with any decharge, deisotope software.
Moreover, possible endogenous proteolysis during sample preparation
and/or storage may also contribute to the observed low molecular weights.

Sensitive and efficient CE separation coupled with
top-down tandem
mass spectrometry on the Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer was used
to profile the Pyrococcus furiosus proteome. Among
four step-eluted Pyrococcus furiosus fractions, CE-top-down
MS/MS identified 71, 67, and 47 proteins and 144, 126, and 63 proteoforms
in the 20% buffer B, 40% buffer B, and 60% buffer B fraction, respectively.
These numbers represent a small portion of the detected protein species
in each fraction (Table 1), and the identified
proteins are the most abundant detected protein species based on a
frequency calculation in the MS1 detected species (data not shown).
A total of 291 proteoforms and 134 proteins were identified at a 2.7%
proteoform level false-discovery rate (FDR) and a 6.0% protein level
FDR with total sample consumption of 270 ng in 120 min of total analysis
time. This accounts for 9% of 1517 proteins identified through the
combined efforts of several bottom-up proteomics studies for this
archaeon.43 Additionally, the current top-down
study also identified six proteins that were not found by the previous
bottom-up studies.43,44 Among those some are very small
proteins being missed for some reason in the bottom-up measurements,
and some have uncharacterized modifications that could be missed by
routine bottom-up analysis. Such proteome coverage (approximately
10% of expressed proteins) is comparable to the largest top-down bacterial
data sets16,18,22 but with improved
sensitivity.

Even though Pyrococcus furiosus is one of the
most extensively studied hyperthermophilic archaea, very little experimentally
verified PTM information is available. Bottom-up proteomics studies
have identified 73% of the total ORFs, but none of them discussed
PTMs in the proteome. There is only limited annotation in the Uniprot
database for Pyrococcus furiosus, and most of the
annotated PTM entries are based on homology as opposed to direct observation.
Top-down interrogation of this proteome could provide more information
about the occurrence of PTMs. The 134 unique Pyrococcus furiosus proteins identified in this study are represented by 291 proteoforms,
48% of which bear diverse PTMs or unexplainable modifications (Supplementary
Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
We found 43 proteins with N-terminal methionine excision, representing
∼32% of the proteins identified (Supplementary Table S1 in
the Supporting Information). We also found
six proteins with an N-terminal acetylation modification, representing
∼4% of the proteins identified. These numbers, which are similar
to data from Salmonella and Escherichia coli, are different than what is found for eukaryotes in which the majority
of proteins undergo N-terminal acetylation. A total of 12 proteins
were found to contain disulfide bonds, and interestingly, proteins
with an even number of cysteines all form disulfide bonds except for
those proteins bearing unexplained modifications. This modification
may make these proteins more thermostable or could be an outcome of
growing at a temperature of 80 °C or higher. Another interesting
finding is that many of proteins were present in oxidized proteoforms.
Even though electrospray ionization can produce oxidation, given that
a similar analysis of the Dam1 complex did not show any obvious oxidation,
the oxidized Pyrococcus furiosus proteoforms may
represent an endogenous modification. The observed oxidations occur
not only on methionine but also on tryptophan and tyrosine. This may
be an outcome of oxidative stress in vivo in the
high temperature environment.

Our top-down data also confirmed
the existence of a hypusine-containing
protein translation initiation factor 5A, which has been inferred
from homology. Hypusine is a nonstandard amino acid residue, found
in all Eucarya, in a single protein–eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A). The hypusinated form of eIF5A is considered
to be the active form, and to date most known functions of eIF5A (such
as translational elongation, RNA binding, and protein–protein
interactions) are wholly or partially dependent upon hypusination.
Hypusine has also been shown to be present in Archaea (but not reported
in Pyrococcus furiosus), where it is similarly found
exclusively in aIF-5A, the archaeal homologue of eIF-5A. We also observed
aIF-5A in the deoxyhypusinated form (+71 Da), its mature form, which
was more prevalent than the hypusinated form in Pyrococcus
furiosus (Figure 3). Although the
modified site cannot be localized due to the limited fragmentation,
K37 is assumed to be the modified residue based on similarity.

Figure 3 Characterization
of hypusine/deoxyhypusine containing protein,
translation initiation factor 5A (IF5A), in Pyrococcus furiosus. Graphical fragmentation maps generated with ProSightPC are shown
for (A) deoxyhypusinated IF5A and (B) hypusinated IF5A.

We found four proteins (P61882, Q8TZV1, Q8U3S9,
and Q8U442, Supplementary
Table S1 in the Supporting Information)
harboring glycosylation, most likely O-linked glycosylation. The modification
site could not be localized possibly due to its labile property, which
renders it unstable during collision-induced dissociation (CID) and
higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) activation. Further investigation
on an electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)-capable mass spectrometer
might be able to localize this type of PTM. The observed +162 and
+324 might indicate a single hexose and a double hexose or disaccharide
such as maltose. This is the first time that glycosylation has been
detected in proteomic analysis of Pyrococcus furiosus. Among these four proteins, two of them are ribosomal proteins,
Q8U3S9 and Q8U442 (Figure 4). The glycosylation
of ribosomal proteins could contribute, through the formation and
the stabilization of the ribosomes, to activation of the translational
machinery. We also found glycosylation on Histone A (P16882) and DNA/RNA-binding
protein Alba (Q8TZV1). The identification of these glycosylated proteins
is consistent with the fact that this organism can utilize a range
of both simple and complex carbohydrates as its primary carbon source.

ribosomal protein S24e). (A) Orbitrap mass spectrum of unmodified
and modified forms of Q8U442. (B) HCD fragmentation spectrum for precursor
987.8612+ and graphical fragmentation map generated with
Byonic.

We also found another nonstandard
amino acid residue α-aminoadipic
acid (identified as Lys+15) in Archaeal Histone A (P61882, Supplementary
Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
The α-aminoadipic acid is an intermediate in the α-aminoadipic
acid (AAA) pathway (present in yeast and some thermophilic bacteria)
for the synthesis of the amino acid l-lysine. The identification
of this amino acid in Pyrococcus furiosus is direct
evidence that lysine biosynthesis via the AAA pathway is also present
in this Archaeon as suggested through gene cluster analysis on hyperthermophilic
archaea P. horikoshii and P. abyssi.45,46

Our top-down analysis found that many
proteins are present as truncated
forms. For example, among 32 ribosomal proteins identified, 24 of
them were present as full-length forms (11 of them also truncated
forms), while 8 were present as only truncated forms. This might suggest
metabolic stability of these ribosomal proteins. Other truncated proteins
might be the result of signal peptide processing.

Identified
proteoforms from MS/MS represent only 10% of the detected
protein species in MS for Pyrococcus furiosus proteome
analysis (Table 1). This is partially due to
the long duty cycle of the top-down experiments, given that all scans
were collected in FT mode and multiple microscans were applied to
increase the S/N. On top of that, the fragmentation efficiency for
intact proteins is not always good enough to permit identification
especially for proteins above 15 kDa. Additional fragmentation methods
such as electron capture dissociation (ECD)/ETD47,48 and UVPD49 could improve the fragmentation
efficiency.

The biggest challenge in top-down database searching
lies in assigning
combinatorial PTMs especially when the delta mass cannot be explained
by expected modifications. Several software programs are designed
to overcome this problem such as MS-Align+50 through spectral alignment and ProSightPC using ΔM mode. However,
the ΔM mode considers the delta mass as a single entity to the
modified sequence and thus is less effective in localizing the modified
sites even though the protein can be identified regardless. Since Pyrococcus furiosus PTMs are poorly annotated in the Uniprot
database, ProSightPC failed to assign many of the PTMs in our data
set. To further characterize proteins in this category, we applied
the Byonic top-down search to our data. Byonic matches theoretical
ions to observed peaks in situ without decharging
or deisotoping of the tandem mass spectra. Even though it identified
fewer proteins than ProSightPC, Byonic’s identifications were
easier to validate manually. Byonic’s wildcard search (blind
modification search) provided complementary information in assigning
unexpected modifications and localizing these modifications (Supplementary
Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

The limited peak capacity of CE separation of intact proteins could
be improved through further prefractionation to increase the proteome
coverage. In bottom-up proteomics, a one-dimensional peptide separation
platform coupled to MS is not sufficient for comprehensive analysis
of complex biological samples; therefore, a variety of multidimensional
peptide separation platforms have been employed by different research
groups. Similar to this, intact protein level separation could also
benefit from the development of a multidimensional separation platform.
In this study, RPLC prefractionation has been applied to first reduce
the sample complexity followed by the high-efficiency CE separation
for further MS detection. RPLC separates proteins according to the
hydrophobicity while CE separation is based on mass and charge; therefore,
these two separation mechanisms are orthogonal. As a proof of concept,
only 4 RPLC fractions were collected for CE-MS analysis; however,
with even more first dimension prefractions the overall peak capacity
could be easily improved (number of prefractions × CE peak capacity).

In conclusion, the sheathless CESI-top down MS provided an ultrasensitive,
fast approach to tackle the challenge of the front-end separation
for top-down proteomics. It is very suitable to analyze proteomes
that are moderately complex with very low sample consumption. Combined
with other orthogonal separation techniques such as RPLC, this could
be applied to more complex biological samples to be analyzed through
top-down interrogation.
