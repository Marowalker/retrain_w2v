Differences
in ionization efficiency among neutral and sialylated
glycans prevent direct quantitative comparison by their respective
mass spectrometric signals. To overcome this challenge, we developed
an integrated chemical strategy, Dual Reactions for Analytical Glycomics
(DRAG), to quantitatively compare neutral and sialylated glycans simultaneously
by MALDI-MS. Initially, two glycan samples to be compared undergo
reductive amination with 2-aminobenzoic acid and 2-13[C6]-aminobenzoic acid, respectively. The different isotope-incorporated
glycans are then combined and subjected to the methylamidation of
the sialic acid residues in one mixture, homogenizing the ionization
responses for all neutral and sialylated glycans. By this approach,
the expression change of relevant glycans between two samples is proportional
to the ratios of doublet signals with a static 6 Da mass difference
in MALDI-MS and the change in relative abundance of any glycan within
samples can also be determined. The strategy was chemically validated
using well-characterized N-glycans from bovine fetuin and IgG from
human serum. By comparing the N-glycomes from a first morning (AM)
versus an afternoon (PM) urine sample obtained from a single donor,
we further demonstrated the ability of DRAG strategy to measure subtle
quantitative differences in numerous urinary N-glycans.

==== Body
Glycans are
a group of carbohydrate
side chains covalently linked to the asparagine residues (N-linked)
and serine or threonine residues (O-linked) of proteins, which are
involved in numerous biological functions such as cell–cell
signaling and interactions, structural modulation of glycoproteins
and pathogen-host recognition.1 Changes
in glycosylation have long been known to be associated with a wide
range of diseases, including the genetic congenital disorders of glycosylation
(CDG) syndrome,2 diabetes,3 virus infection,4 and tumor
progression.5 Furthermore, consistent glycosylation
is a critical aspect of quality control in the production of therapeutic
glycoproteins, because glycosylation significantly affects the overall
efficiency, efficacy, and safety of therapeutic glycoproteins.6 Therefore, the development of a mass spectrometry
(MS)-based strategy to measure quantitative changes of protein glycosylation
is desired for academic, biotechnological, and pharmaceutical laboratories.

Several MS-based quantitative strategies exist utilizing common
chemical modifications of glycans such as permethylation,7,8 reductive amination,9−12 and hydrazone formation.13 All of these
strategies employ chemically similar but isotopically differentiated
tags to derivatize glycan samples, so that they can be distinguished
and quantitatively compared by MS.14 Most
current strategies are effective in various ways, but each has deficiencies.

Permethylation is a classic strategy to modify nearly all functional
groups within glycans,15 including hydroxyl
groups, carboxylic acid groups, N-actylamide groups, and the hemiacetal
group (often referred to as the reducing end). By coupling to the
stable isotope-incorporated reagents,8,16 permethylation
has been applied to measure the quantitative changes of relevant glycans
from biological samples.14 However, two
technical issues are often associated with this approach. First of
all, the numbers of functional groups within an individual glycan
are proportional to its size, resulting in variable mass differences
between “light” and “heavy”-isotope-incorporated
glycans. Given the remarkable heterogeneity of glycans from biological
samples, the variable differences create the challenge to locate the
pairs of relevant glycans from two respective samples. Second, the
complete permethylation of all types of glycans from a biological
sample is often problematic because different glycans may have different
reaction efficiencies.13,15 Even though the side products
can be minimized by the solid-phase protocol,7,8 they
are impossible to fully avoid.13 In fact,
these side products are often highly similar to real glycans; even
a subsequent MS/MS fragmentation might present characteristic fragments
of glycans.

The reductive amination and hydrazone formation
only derivatize
the reducing end within glycans. Bowman and Zaia have reported a set
of tetraplex amination tags (+0, +4, +8, +12) to compare four respective
samples in parallel.12 Other approaches
using some commercially available reagents have also been reported.9−11 More recently, the labile hydrazone product was also employed to
incorporate stable-isotopes into glycans,13 permitting direct LC-MS analysis without any postderivatization
purification step. However, neither reductive amination nor hydrazone
will affect the carboxylic acid groups within sialic acid residues,
one of common monosaccharides in mammalian glycans,17 preventing the direct comparison of neutral and acidic
glycans within one sample due to their dramatically different ionization
efficiencies. Particularly with MALDI-MS, the nonderivatized sialic
acid residues are often lost due to in- and postsource decay.18,19 Although the negative ion mode MS might be an alternative option
for acidic glycans,20 it is impractical
for a biological sample that often contains a vast number of neutral
and acidic glycans with variable sialic acid residues.

An ideal
MS-based quantitative strategy should not only measure
the expression differences of an individual or a group of glycans
between samples, but determine the relative abundances of them within
samples. Herein we report an integrated chemical strategy, Dual Reactions
for Analytical Glycomics (DRAG), to quantify both neutral and sialylated
glycans simultaneously and comparatively. In this approach, the reducing
end and the sialic acid residues are separately modified in two respective
steps (Figure 1). The “light”
and “heavy” isotope-incorporated tags, 2-AA and 2-13[C6]-AA, are incorporated into the glycans during
the initial reductive amination step, and the sialic acid residues
are converted into their methylamidated derivatives during the second
step. Similar to other approaches, the expression difference of the
same glycan between samples can be deduced from their MS signals.14 In addition, because all sialylated glycans
are neutralized, DRAG permits simultaneous quantification of neutral
and sialylated glycans within one sample, enabling the determination
of the relative distribution of each glycan within a single sample.

Figure 1 Workflow
of the Dual Reactions for Analytical Glycome (DRAG). The
released N-glycans from two respective samples are initially aminated
with the pair of 2-AA and 2-13[C6]-AA, respectively.
The aminated glycans are then mixed together and subjected to the
methylamidation of sialic acid residues. After the dual reactions,
all glycans are converted to neutral molecules, minimizing the drastic
ionization differences often existing among neutral and nonmodified
sialylated glycans. This permitted the quantitative analysis of both
neutral and acidic glycans simultaneously by positive ion MS. The
relative change of a glycan’s abundance between two samples
can be readily measured from the corresponding MS doublet signals
with a 6 Da mass difference.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Materials
Human IgG
from serum, bovine
fetuin, 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB), 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA), 2-13[C6]-aminobenzoic acid, iodoacetamide, dithiothreitol,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methylamine hydrochloride, (7-azabenzotriazol-1-yloxy)trispyrrolidinophosphonium
hexafluorophosphate (PyAOP), 4-methylmorpholine, sodium hydroxide,
cellulose (medium fibrous), iodomethane, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). N-Glycosidase
F (PNGase F) was obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA).
The Viva Spin series of spin filters (10K and 30K MWCO) were purchased
from Sartorius Stedium Biotech (Aubagne, France).

Human Urine
Specimens
Human urine specimens were obtained
from one male healthy donor under an institutional review board-approved
protocol. Two urine samples were collected, one in the morning as
the first morning void (AM) and one in the afternoon
(PM) of the same day. Urine samples were initially passed
through a 0.22 μm PVDF syringe filter (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA) to remove particles and cell debris, further concentrated by a
VIVA SPIN filter (5K MWCO), and stored at −80 °C for later
use. Protein concentrations were measured in triplicate by the Bradford
assay.

N-Glycan Sample Preparation
All N-glycan samples were
obtained according to the GlycoFilter protocol.21 Typically, 100–150 μg of glycoprotein samples
was de-N-glycosylated by PNGase F in a single filter device via domestic
microwave procedure.22 The released N-glycans
were eluted into the collecting chamber of the filter by repeated
centrifugation. All the flow-through fractions were combined and dried
completely. Without further purification, the dried glycans underwent
subsequent derivatization.

Derivatization with 2-AB
The glycans
were derivatized
with 2-AB using a DMSO/acetic acid procedure.10 The derivatized glycans were purified by a hand-packed cellulose
cartridge in an organic solution (1-butanol/ethanol/water, 4:1:1,
v/v/v).23 The reaction mixtures were diluted
with 1 mL of the organic solution, and applied to the cartridge. After
washing the cartridge with 3 mL of organic solution, the derivatized
glycans were eluted with 2 mL of an aqueous solution (ethanol/water,
1:1, v/v) and dried completely in a speed vacuum.

Derivatization
with 2-AA or 2-13[C6]-AA
The glycans
were derivatized with 2-AA (or 2-13[C6]-AA)
using a methanol-based condition.24 After
reactions, the respective 2-AA and 2-13[C6]-AA
derivatized samples were pooled and subjected
to the cellulose-cartridge purification as described as above.

Methylamidation
of Sialic Acid Residues
The 2-AA or
2-AB derivatized glycan samples were further methylamidated according
to a previous report.25,36 Briefly, the dried glycan samples
were dissolved in 10 μL of DMSO solution containing 5 M methylamine
hydrochloride, followed by the addition of 10 μL of PyAOP (250
mM in 30% 4-methylmorpholine/DMSO). The reaction proceeded at room
temperature with constant shaking for 45 min. The final products were
purified by a second cellulose cartridge. It is also noteworthy that
fresh and anhydrous reagents should be used for this reaction because
the presence of trace amount of water may significantly affect the
efficiency of this modification.

Permethylation of Glycans
Glycans were permethylated
according to the solid phase protocol.8

Analyzing Glycans by MALDI-MS
MALDI-MS was carried
out on a MDS SCIEX 4800 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) equipped
with an Nd:YAG laser with 355 nm wavelength of <500 ps pulse and
200 Hz repetition rate. The spectrometer was operated in the positive
ion reflectron mode. External calibration was performed using the
ProteoMass Peptide MALDI-MS calibration kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). The matrix solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of DHB in
a volume of 1 mL of 50% acetonitrile containing 8 mM sodium acetate.
Glycans were spotted directly onto a stainless steel MALDI plate and
mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (0.5–1 μL)
until air-dry. The MS data were initially processed and exported using
Data Explorer 4.9 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).

Automated Analysis
of MALDI-MS Quantitative Spectra
To facilitate the quantitative
analysis, an R-language pipeline for
postprocessing and quantifying MALDI-MS data was developed in house.
In brief, the R-pipeline reads in spectral data from the Data Explorer
4.9 output, and performs regional baseline removal and peak picking
using modules from MALDIquant Bioconductor R package, version 1.526 plus custom modules. The detected peak centers,
combined with the expected masses of all possible urinary glycans
from a previous report,21 were mined for
any peak cluster patterns that correspond to a “light”
cluster for one glycan and the associated “heavy” cluster
of the same glycan from a different sample, separated by a static
6 Da mass difference. When at least three isotopic peak pairs 6 Da
apart were identified within a 12 Da peak window, a related glycan
doublet was declared and manually checked. The defined peak clusters
were then quantified and compared using either peak height (intensity)
or peak area (trapezoidal rule) as outlined in the Results and Discussion.

Results and Discussion
Selection
of Dual Reactions
In theory, all reductive
amination reagents can be applied to derivatize the reducing end of
a glycan, even including the synthetic hydrazine reagent.13 2-AA was selected as the best option because
of several practical considerations (Figure 1): (1) the conditions to completely modify glycans with 2-AA have
been well established;24 (2) its stable-isotopic
analogues are commercial available; in fact, 2-13[C6]-AA and 2-13[C7]-AA have already been
applied for the quantitative glycomic comparison of different samples;10,11 and (3) 2-AA is a sensitive fluorescent reagent, enabling subsequent
separation and detection by liquid chromatography if needed.27

The neutralization of sialic acid residues
has been performed by various chemical methods including permethylation,7 methyl esterification,18 lactone formation,28 perbenzoylation,29 and amidation.30 To
be compatible for a quantitative strategy, the ideal modification
should derivatize all sialic acid residues completely without any
side products. In N-glycans, there are two types of sialic acid to
Gal linkages (α2,3 and α2,6), and it was well-known that
the α2,3-linkage favors the formation of a lactone between sialic
acid and Gal residues by the loss of a molecule of H2O.28 However, recent reports have demonstrated that
both linkages could be activated by PyAOP and quantitatively converted
into the methylamidated derivatives under very mild conditions.25,36 Furthermore, the product of methylamidation of carboxylic acid (Figure 1) was much more stable as compared to other types
of modifications such as methyl ester or lactone. Therefore, the PyAOP
activated methylamidation was chosen for the DRAG strategy (Figure 1).

After DRAG, all sialylated glycans were
converted into neutral
molecules that can be readily analyzed by positive mode MS. In this
proof-of-concept report, MALDI-MS was chosen due to its simple procedure,
strong tolerance to impurities, and single sodium-adduct ion species
for each glycan, which simplifies the quantitative comparison.19

Validating the Chemical Feasibility of the
DRAG Strategy
The feasibility of DRAG was validated using
the N-glycans released
from a well-studied glycoprotein, bovine fetuin, that carries a series
of multiantennary glycans with sialic acid residues.31 Three aliquots of fetuin N-glycans were derivatized, in
parallel, by permethylation (Figure 2B), reductive
amination with 2-AB and neutralization (Figure 2C), and reductive amination with 2-AA and neutralization (Figure 2D). The nonderivatized glycans were also profiled
by (+) MALDI-MS (Figure 2A). As expected, the
profile of nonderivatized glycans was dominated by many side products
(m/z 2028.4, 2275.5, 2341.5, 2654.5,
and 2967.6) due to possible in- and postsource side reactions.20,21 Two molecular ions were observed with near baseline signals (m/z 2610.9 and 2902.0). Further indicating
that positive mode of MALDI-MS was not sensitive to detect non-modified
sialic acid residue. Permethylation stabilized the sialic acid residues
and homogenized the ionization efficiency among glycans with different
sialic acid residues (Figure 2B). Although
the possible in- and postsource side products were minimized, the
permethylation brought in unwanted others such as under-permethylated
and oxidized side products ([M-nX14] + and [M-nX16]+, n =
integral). Both DRAG approaches provided much cleaner spectra without
any evident side products by MALDI-MS (Figures 2C,D), and all the peaks were the expected products of corresponding
sialylated glycans, indicating that both modifications were processed.
Interestingly, the same glycans aminated by the respective 2-AB and
2-AA had a 14 Da mass difference in the products, suggesting that
the endogenous carboxylic acid group of 2-AA was also derivatized
with methylamide. To evaluate the reproducibility of the DRAG strategy,
additional replicates were undertaken on fetuin N-glycans (Supporting Information, Figure S1). As expected,
the standard deviations from the permethylation were much wider than
those from DRAG, presumably caused by side reactions associated the
permethylation reaction. The slight differences on the relative abundance
of the same glycan between the permethylation and DRAG strategies
may reflect slight difference in ionization efficiencies between two
approaches, and may also relate to the side reactions with the permethylation
reaction. This experiment demonstrated that it was feasible to perform
DRAG on sialylated glycans and to homogenize the ionization efficiency
with variable numbers of sialic acid residues.

Figure 2 Feasibility of DRAG strategy
was chemically validated using modular
N-glycans released from bovine fetuin. The (+) MALDI-MS spectra were
obtained from the nonderivatized (A), and the permethylated (B), the
aminated with 2-AB followed by methylamidation (C), and the aminated
with 2-AA followed by methylamidation (D). Most peaks in the nonderivatized
profile (A) were side products due to possible in and postsource reactions,
which could not be fully explained. The evident side products ([M-nX14] + and [M-nX16]+, n = integral) of the permethylation reaction were
annotated as (*). All peaks were single sodium adducts.

Comparative Testing on Standard N-Glycans
To demonstrate
the quantitative capability of DRAG, a pair of “light”
and “heavy” 2-AA reagents was used to derivatize N-glycans
in parallel. The N-glycans from serum IgG was tested for this purpose
because they have been well characterized and primarily consist of
complex-type neutral glycans with a small amount of sialylated glycans.32,33 The evaluation on IgG N-glycans also determined whether there was
any potential artificial effect on neutral glycans that do not carry
any sialic acid residues.

Two equivalent aliquots were reacted
separately with 2-12[C6]-AA and 2-13[C6]-AA and followed by the neutralization in a mixture.
As shown in Figure 3A, a total of 12 pairs
of N-glycan compositions were detected, in which six of them contained
one or two sialic acid residues in the high mass region (2000–2800
Da). Similar to its permethylated profile,22 the spectrum obtained from the DRAG strategy was dominated by the
common IgG-type compositions: G0F (m/z: 1619.6 vs 1625.6), G1F (m/z:
1781.6 vs 1787.6), and G2F (m/z:
1943.7 vs 1949.7),32 suggesting that the
ionization responses of neutral glycans were less likely to be altered
by the methylamidated sialoglycans. The same approach was further
tested on the equal molar mixtures of fetuin N-glycans (Figure 3B), yielding the expected pairs of 6 Da-separated
doublet signals (m/z: 2101.8 vs
2107.8; 2405.9 vs 2411.9; 2771.1 vs 2777.1; 3075.2 vs 3081.2; and
3379.3 vs 3385.3).

Figure 3 MALDI-MS spectra of N-glycans from human serum IgG (A)
and from
bovine fetuin (B) after processed by the DRAG strategy with a predetermined
ratio at 1:1.The most plausible structure for each individual composition
was shown according to previous reports; no further effort has been
carried out to fully examine the structural details. All peaks were
single sodium adducts.

Dynamic Range of Comparative Quantification
Previous
reports have demonstrated that the stable isotope-incorporated strategies
had a 10-fold dynamic range for relative comparison when analyzed
by MALDI-MS.9,11 Accordingly, the proper aliquots
of fetuin N-glycans were obtained and separately derivatized with
either 2-AA or 2-13[C6]-AA. After the reaction,
the aminated aliquots were mixed in a series of predetermined ratios
(10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10) with triplicates, followed
by methylamidation. Although both areas and heights of the monoisotopic
peaks yielded similar ratios when the expected ratios were close to
1:1, significant deviations were found for larger ratios such as 10:1
and 1:10 (Figure 4A), suggesting the low abundant
species of a large ratio were more likely to be severely affected
by MS instrument (for instance, the raised background or local noise).
To find the best quantitation parameters for the pipeline, we systematically
investigated a series of isotopic peak combinations (either peak area
or height) of three abundant pairs of sialylated glycans (m/z: 2405.9 vs 2411.9, 3075.2 vs 3081.2,
and 3379.3 vs 3385.3, Figure 3B) from all spectra.
As shown in Figure 4A, the monoisotopic peak
alone (peak 1) generated the widest deviations to the expected ratio
for both peak area (blue bar) and peak height (red bar). After evaluating
several approaches, it was determined that the summing of multiple
isotopic peaks, and the use of peak height rather than area, was the
most effective strategy to minimize these variations and to maximize
ratio accuracy, such as the peak height combination of 1–3
or 1–4 (Figure 4A). The combination
of multiple isotopic peaks also improved precision, as measured by
lower CVs (coefficient of variation; Figure 4B). Therefore, the height combination of peaks 1–3 was chosen
as the signals for the quantitative calculation, rather than a single
monoisotopic peak as previous approaches.9 As shown in Figure 4C, the calculated standard
curve from three pairs of sialylated glycans had a nearly linear relationship
(R2 = 0.9893) over the full range (10:1
to 1:10) by the height combination of peaks 1–3, indicating
that the DRAG strategy had a similar 10-fold dynamic range, comparable
to other single-modification strategies while analyzed by MALDI-MS.9,11

Figure 4 Selection
of best MS signals for the quantification. All the MS
signals were obtained from the MALDI-MS spectra of three pairs of
fetuin N-glycans (m/z: 2405.9 vs
2411.9, 3075.2 vs 3081.2, and 3379.3 vs 3385.3, Figure 3B) with a series of premixed ratios (10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1,
1:2, 1:5, and 1:10). The % absolute difference from expected ratios
(A) and the absolute coefficient of variation (CV) among all measurements
(B) were shown as boxplot diagrams, employing the different combinations
of various isotopic peaks (peak area, blue; and peak height, red).
The height combination of first three peaks (1–3) was chosen
as the best MS signals for the quantification calculation. This combination
yielded the standard curve plot (C), including all three pairs of
sialylated glycans (blue trend line), showing a nearly exact fit to
the theoretical trend line (red) in a range from (10:1 to 1:10) when
analyzed by MALDI-MS.

Quantitative Comparison of Two Urinary N-Glycomes
To
further test this strategy on complex biological samples, two urine
specimens were obtained from a single adult donor. One specimen was
collected in the early morning (i.e., AM) and the other
in the late afternoon (i.e., PM). In both AM and PM samples, N-glycans were released from the same
amount of urinary protein, and processed by the DRAG approach with
2-12[C6]-AA (AM) and 2-13[C6]-AA (PM), respectively. As shown in Figure 5A, a highly heterogeneous profile was obtained,
ranging from a small fucosylated core structure (m/z: 1213.5 vs 1219.5) to large complex-type N-glycan
with four sialic acid residues (m/z: 3890.5 vs 3896.5). A total of 34 pairs of N-glycan compositions
were identified based on their m/z values and the plausible biosynthetic pathway (Supporting Information, Table S1). Using the summed heights
of peaks 1–3, both urinary N-glycomes appear quantitatively
similar to each other because almost one-third of the ratios were
close to 1 (from 0.9 to 1.1, Supporting Information,
Table S1). However, subtle differences were detected in these
two-related urine specimens. For instance, among the three most abundant
high-mannose type glycans, the ratios for Hex5HexNAc2 (1.02, Figure 5B) and Hex7HexNAc2 (0.95, Figure 5D) were
nearly 1. However, the ratio for Hex6HexNAc2 was as large as 1.28 (Figure 5C), suggesting
that Hex6HexNAc2 might be produced much less
in the PM. In contrast to high-mannose type glycans,
the ratios for the two most abundant sialylated glycans, Hex5HexNAc4SA2 and Hex5HexNAc4SA2Fuc, were both smaller than 1 (Supporting Information, Table S1), suggesting that those sialylated
glycans might be produced slightly more in the PM urine.

Figure 5 Quantitative
comparison of two urinary N-glycomes (AM vs PM). Both N-glycomes were labeled with 2-AA (AM) and 2-13[C6]-AA (PM), respectively, and measured
by MALDI-MS (A). Three zoom-in spectra
of three high-mannose type compositions: Hex5HexNAc2 (Man-5, B), Hex6HexNAc2 (Man-6, C),
and Hex7HexNAc2 (Man-7, D). All quantitative
ratios were calculated using the sums of the first three peak heights
(Supporting Information, Table S1). All
peaks were single sodium adducts.

Furthermore, it was also feasible to calculate the relative
distribution
of an individual glycan within the same sample, if the subtle ionization
differences were not considered between hydroxyl group and methylamidated
carboxylic acid group. Employing this concept, the sample-specific
relative distribution of each glycan was obtained (Supporting Information, Table S1). According to these ratios,
it further indicated that both urinary N-glycomes were highly similar
to each other because the majority of glycans had the same kind of
sample-specific relative distribution. For instance, Hex6HexNAc2 (Man-6) was still the most abundant composition
in both samples (29.00% of AM vs 22.69% of PM, Figure 5C); even the absolute amount of
Man-6 appeared less in PM urine. Whereas for the three
most abundant sialylated glycans, Hex5HexNAc4Neu5AcFuc, Hex5HexNAc4Neu5Ac2, and
Hex5HexNAc4Neu5Ac2Fuc, there were
slight increases of sample-specific relative distribution along with
three comparative ratios less than 1, implying more expression of
sialylated glycans in PM urine sample. To our surprise,
the summed MS signals of all detected glycans were nearly identical
between AM and PM samples (the last row, Supporting Information, Table S1), suggesting
the absolute amount of N-glycans in urines from morning to afternoon
was relatively stable. In order to evaluate the reproducibility of
the measurements, two additional replicates were identically processed
for the same pair of urinary specimens (Supporting
Information, Table S2). The relative ratios from these replicates
were near identical with a relative standard deviation of less than
5%.

Based on this proof-of principle experiment by MALDI-MS,
we are
currently performing a large-scale comparative quantitative glycomics
experiment utilizing DRAG to identify glycan specific differences
in the urinary glycome for various diseases. DRAG allows both the
comparison of absolute expression change of each individual glycan
between two samples, but also the change in sample-specific relative
abundances.

Since an individual composition may contain numerous
isomers which
differ in branching pattern, inter-residue linkage, or even anomeric
configuration (α or β),34,35 it was not
clear whether the quantitative changes of one composition between AM and PM urines were caused by one or several
structural isomers. Certainly, the quantitative comparison on the
compositional level may be practical for an initial screen because
it often takes significant effort to characterize full structural
details of a single glycan.10,35 Those compositions
with distinguished quantitative ratios might provide the best candidates
for further validation, a critical step in the discovery of glycan-based
biomarkers.

Conclusion
In this proof of principle
report, we described DRAG, an integrated
strategy to modify the reducing end and the sialic acid residues of
a glycan sequentially. The modification chemistries were carefully
chosen to avoid potential side reactions and also to minimize the
ionization efficiency differences between the modified sialic acid
residues and other monosaccharides within glycans. After the dual
modifications, all glycans had been shifted to neutral molecules,
permitting a quantitative analysis of both types of glycans simultaneously.
As this work has demonstrated, if two samples are separately aminated
with different stable isotope-incorporated reagents, the absolute
changes of an individual glycan between samples can be obtained by
distinguished doublet peaks with 6 Da mass differences in MALDI-MS.
The feasibility has also been demonstrated to track the changes in
sample-specific relative abundance of an individual glycan, a concept
often employed by the permethylation strategy. Considering these valuable
benefits, the DRAG strategy provides a unique approach to perform
quantitative comparisons on the N-glycome, with demonstrated improvements
over existing methods.
