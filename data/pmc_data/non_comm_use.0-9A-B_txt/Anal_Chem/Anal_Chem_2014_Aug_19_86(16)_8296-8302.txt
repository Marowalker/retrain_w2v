Tetrabromobisphenol
A (TBBPA) is a ubiquitous flame retardant.
A high-throughput immunoassay would allow for monitoring of human
and environmental exposures as a part of risk assessment. Naturally
occurring antibodies in camelids that are devoid of light chain, show
great promise as an efficient tool in monitoring environmental contaminants,
but they have been rarely used for small molecules. An alpaca was
immunized with a TBBPA hapten coupled to thyroglobulin and a variable
domain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) T3–15 highly selective
for TBBPA was isolated from a phage displayed VHH library using heterologous
coating antigens. Compared to the VHHs isolated using homologous antigens,
VHH T3–15 had about a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity in
an immunoassay. This assay, under the optimized conditions of 10%
methanol in the assay buffer (pH 7.4), had an IC50 for
TBBPA of 0.40 ng mL–1 and negligible cross reactivity
(<0.1%) with other tested analogues. After heating the VHH at 90
°C for 90 min about 20% of the affinity for coating antigen T3-BSA
remained. The recoveries of TBBPA from spiked soil and fetal bovine
serum samples ranged from 90.3% to 110.7% by ELISA and agreed well
with a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method.
We conclude the many advantages of VHH make them attractive for the
development of immunoassays to small molecules.

Introduction
Tetrabromobisphenol
A (2,2-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane;
TBBPA) is the largest brominated flame retardant (BFR) in terms of
production volume globally.1 It is widely
used in improving fire safety as an additive flame retardant or a
reactive retardant with incorporation into plastics and other materials
as its diglycidyl ether. TBBPA can be released to the environment
during its production, usage, and disposal. Although TBBPA has lower
toxicity than many other BFRs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers
(PBDEs), it can cause hepatic and kidney lesions in pregnant mice
and their offspring when pregnant dams are exposed to TBBPA in the
diet2 and endocrine disruption due to the
structural resemblance of TBBPA to thyroid hormones.3 By mimicking β-estradiol, TBBPA can bind to the human
estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1), a key hormone metabolizing enzyme,4 and it was also reported to induce transcription
of E2-activated genes in mosquitofish in vivo.5 TBBPA has been detected in abiotic samples, such
as soil (<0.3 ng g–1 dry weight (dw) in farming
land and 3.4–32.2 ng g–1 dw in industrial
soils),6 sediment (3.8–230 ng g–1 dw in Dongjiang river in China7 and 34–270 ng g–1 dw in a stream
of the industry8), sewage sludge (up to
1329 ng g–1 dw in Ebro River basin9 and up to 472 ng g–1 dw from Catalonia
in Spain10), and indoor dust (490–520
ng g–1 in Japan),11 as
well as in biotic samples, such as human breast milk (up to 12.46
ng g–1 lipid weight (lw) in Beijing12 and 30–550 pg g–1 lw in Boston13) and serum (up to 3.4 pmol g–1 lw in computer technicians).14

TBBPA is usually determined by chromatographic methods, such as
HPLC–MS/MS (the limit of detection (LOD) reported as 0.5 ng
g–1),15 UPLC–MS/MS
(LOD of 60 pg g–1)12 and
GC–MS (LOD of 90 pg g–1).6 Even though highly sensitive and selective, these instrumental
methods are very time-consuming, costly, and require complex operations
such as derivatization for GC–MS analysis. Immunoassays based
on polyclonal antibody (PAb) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) against
TBBPA have proven to be sensitive, selective, and capable of high
throughput in the monitoring of this environmental pollutant in water,
soils, and sediments.16,17 In an earlier work, the haptens
of TBBPA were synthesized, and the PAb-based immunoassay was developed,
with a half-maximum signal inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.87 ng mL–1.16 The biotin–streptavidin-amplified PAb-based and the mAb-based
immunoassays for TBBPA showed an IC50 of 0.58 ng mL–117 and 3.87 ng mL–1,18 respectively.

Since antibodies
devoid of light chain were discovered in the serum
of the camel (Camelus dromedarius),19 camelid antibodies have been gaining more attention in
many biotechnological applications.20 Conventional
IgGs (mAb and PAb) are about 150 kDa, while the antigen-binding fragment,
a variable domain of heavy chain antibody (VHH), is about 15 kDa,21 making it suitable for construction of a high
throughput selection system, such as phage, yeast, or ribosome.22 It has been demonstrated that VHHs have high
thermal stability, high solubility, and are easily and cheaply expressed
in high yield.23 Although both VHH and
heavy chains of conventional antibodies have four framework regions
(FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4) and three complementarity determining regions
(CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3), binding by the VHH paratope, in absence of
the variable light chain, is compensated for by the extension of the
CDR1 loop, highly hydrophilic amino acid of FR2 and the longer convex-shaped
CDR3.24 Due to these advantages, VHH has
been used as a therapeutic tool in various disease areas.25−27 More recently, VHHs were exploited in detecting environmental contaminants
such as azoxystrobin28 and triclocarban,29 as well as the breakdown product of some pyrethroid
insecticides, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA).30 Thus, they are showing promise for small-molecule analysis in general
and in environmental analysis in particular.

Construction and
use of phage display peptide libraries is a general
and useful method to select the high-affinity antibody.31 A vast repertoire of antibody fragments can
be displayed on the phage surface. Thus, a key step to an effective
selection strategy is to enrich and isolate the specific VHH ligands
from a large number of nonspecific phage clones. Biopanning with homologous
coating antigens on solid plates is a common method of selecting ligands
by competition for the small-molecule target.28−30 Heterology
in immunizing antigen and coating antigen has been extensively employed
to improve the sensitivity32 and selectivity33 of immunoassays for small molecule analytes,
by minimizing nonspecific binding by the antibody. The heterology
was also introduced for hybridoma screening for the target of interest
in the production of mAb,34−36 e.g. mAbs with a broad-selectivity
for parathion, methyl parathion, fenitrothion, and isocarbophos have
been produced.36 On the basis of the advantages,
we hypothesized that screening with heterologous coating antigens
would be useful in the selective isolation of single-domain antibodies.

In this study, a VHH selective for TBBPA was isolated from a phage-display
library with a novel heterologous selection system and was used to
develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for monitoring
environmental and human exposure to TBBPA. To our knowledge, this
is the first systematic study on the influence of heterologous antigen
selection on the VHH-based immunoassay sensitivity and specificity.

Experimental
Section
Safety
Prior to disposal, all the containers (e.g.,
centrifuge tubes and flasks) for phage incubation were immersed in
10% bleach solution overnight, followed by autoclaving. All the disposable
items (pipet tips and tubes) in contact with phages were autoclaved
before being discarded. TBBPA and its analogues were discarded as
hazardous waste according to campus policies.

Materials and Methods
The synthesis of haptens T1–T6
(Figure 1) and the conjugation of haptens to
carrier proteins were described in the previous report.16 TBBPA standard was purchased from TCI Co. Ltd.
(Tokyo, Japan). TBBPA derivatives and other BFR analogues were purchased
from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT). The anti-HA tag antibody (horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugate) (ab1265) and goat antirabbit IgG (HRP
conjugate) (ab97051) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). HisPur
Ni-NTA resin, B-PER, Halt protease inhibitor cocktail, and Nunc MaxiSorp
flat-bottom 96-well plates were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc. (Rockford, IL, U.S.A.). Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant,
thyroglobulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB), polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Mouse anti-M13 phage mAb-HRP
was from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.). Rabbit anti-alpaca
PAb was produced in the laboratory. The phagemid vector pComb3X was
a gift from Dr. Carlos F. Barbas (The Scripps Research Institute,
La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.). Electrocompetent E. coli ER2738
cells were acquired from Lucigen Corporation (Middleton, WI). M13KO7
helper phage and SfiI were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich,
MA).

Selection of anti-TBBPA Phage-VHHs from VHH library
A four-year old castrated male alpaca was immunized subcutaneously
with T5-thyroglobulin six times biweekly. The VHH phage display library
was constructed with the blood lymphocytes collected after the sixth
injection using the method described previously.30 Briefly, the total mRNA was transcribed to complementary
DNA, and VHH fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). VHH IgG variable domains were ligated into the plasmid pComb3X
using restriction sites SfiI. Then the ligated material was electroporated
into electrocompetent cells E. coli ER 2738.

One well of a microtiter plate was coated overnight with 100 μL
of T5-BSA (10 μg mL–1) at 4 °C, and an
additional four wells with 100 μL of 3% BSA in coating buffer.
The plate was blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS (0.01 mol L–1 phosphate, 0.137 mol L–1 NaCl, 3 mmol L–1 KCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h at ambient temperature. A 100-μL aliquot
of phage-display VHH library was added into the first well with 5%
methanol (MeOH) and incubated for 2 h with gentle shaking at ambient
temperature. After washing 10 times with PBST (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS),
this well was eluted with 100 μL of TBBPA (1000 ng mL–1) in PBS containing 5% MeOH for 1 h at ambient temperature with shaking.
The eluent was transferred in equal aliquots to the next four BSA-coated
wells to remove VHH phage that binds nonspecifically. Then the eluent
was collected for the determination of phage titer and phage amplification.
The phage eluent was amplified with addition of the M13KO7 helper
phage (1 × 1012 cfu mL–1) for the
next round of panning, which was described by Barbas et al.37 The entire panning process was repeated three
times, except the concentrations of coating antigen and TBBPA to elute
the VHH phage were decreased gradually. The concentrations of T5-BSA
for the second, third, and fourth panning were 5, 2.5, and 1 μg
mL–1, respectively. Meanwhile, the concentrations
of TBBPA were decreased to 200, 40, and 10 ng mL–1, respectively. After four rounds of panning, several phage clones
were tested for their binding ability with TBBPA by a competitive
phage ELISA,30 and the optimal one was
selected for the remaining studies.

Similarly, the heterologous
coating antigens T1-BSA and T3-BSA
were separately coated to isolate VHHs from the VHH library.

Expression
and Purification of VHH
The cloned plasmids
pComb3X containing the anti-TBBPA VHHs were extracted from ER2738
and heat shock transformed to Top 10F′ cells. A 1-mL aliquot
of overnight culture was diluted in 100 mL of Super Broth with 50
μg mL–1 carbenicillin and 2 mL of 1 M MgCl2. After shaking for 8 h, the culture was induced with 1 mM
IPTG and incubated in a shaker at 37 °C overnight. The culture
was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was lysed with B-PER lysis buffer
(4 mL g–1 pellet) containing protease inhibitors
at ambient temperature for 10 min. The cell lysate supernatants were
collected by centrifugation at 13000 × g for
10 min, followed by purifying on a 1-mL Ni-NTA resin column. The column
was equilibrated and washed with 40 mM imidazole (dissolved in 10
mM PBS, pH 7.4). The VHH was eluted with 150 mM imidazole, and the
purified VHH was stored at −20 °C after dialysing with
three buffer changes with PBS at 4 °C.

VHH Competitive ELISA
The optimal concentrations of
coating antigens and VHH dilutions were selected by a checkerboard
titration. A 100-μL solution of T3-BSA (2 μg mL–1) was coated on a 96-well microtiter plate at 4 °C overnight.
The plate was blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at ambient
temperature the next day. A series dilution of TBBPA (50 μL/well,
10% MeOH in PBS) was added, followed by the addition of 50 μL
of VHH in PBST (0.02 μg μL–1). After
incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the plate was washed five
times with PBST, and then 100 μL of goat anti-HA tag IgG-HRP
(diluted at 1:25000 with PBST) was added. After another incubation
step and washing step, 100 μL of TMB solution (400 μL
of 0.6% TMB and 100 μL of 1% H2O2 dilution
in 25 mL citrate buffer, pH 5.5) was added into the plate, and the
reaction was stopped 10 min later by the addition of 50 μL of
2 M H2SO4. The absorbance was read at 450 nm
on a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The
IC50, an indicator of the assay sensitivity, and the LOD,
set as the IC10, were obtained from a four-parameter logistic
equation from SigmaPlot 10.0.

Different concentrations of MeOH
or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (5, 10, 20, and 40%) in PBST were used
to dilute the TBBPA to optimize the assay performance.

Characteristics
of VHH
VHH was diluted with PBST at
different pHs (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0). Correspondingly,
the TBBPA was dissolved in the PBST with pH ranging from 4.0 to 11.0.
Then calibration curves of ELISA were generated at different pH values.

For the thermal stability study, VHH was incubated at 90 °C
for 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 min, followed by cooling to room temperature.
The binding of the VHH to the coating antigen T3-BSA was subsequently
evaluated by ELISA.

Cross-Reactivity
The selectivity
of the VHH ELISA was
evaluated by determining the cross-reactivity (CR) with several TBBPA
derivatives and other analogues. For these studies CR was calculated
as  

Sample Preparation
Soil samples
were collected from
the plow layer (0–10 cm) at the campus of the University of
California at Davis. The soils were dried and sieved through a 100-mesh
screen and kept in a sealed container until use. Two grams of soil
was weighed and spiked with 10, 100, and 1000 ng g–1 TBBPA. Ethyl acetate (15 mL) was added, and the sample was sonicated
for 20 min. The extraction process was repeated twice, and the extracts
were combined and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant was evaporated and redissolved with 2 mL of MeOH.
The blank fetal bovine serum (FBS) was bought from Gemini Bio Products
(Calabasas, CA, U.S.A.). TBBPA was spiked into 1.5 mL of FBS with
a final concentration of 10, 100, and 1000 ng mL–1. A solid phase extraction (SPE) HLB cartridge (6 mL, Oasis, Waters)
was conditioned with ethyl acetate and MeOH, and equilibrated with
H2O. After loading the supernatants, the cartridge was
washed with 4 mL of H2O (2% formic acid and 5% MeOH) and
eluted with 2 mL of MeOH followed by 2 mL of ethyl acetate. The samples
were divided for instrumental and ELISA analysis.

The VHH ELISA
was validated with LC–MS/MS (Waters/Micromass, Manchester,
UK), which was carried out on a Supelco Discover C18 column (5 cm
× 2.1 mm, 5 μm, Sigma). Water (solution A) and acetonitrile
containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (solution B) were used as mobile
phase with a flow rate of 0.3 mL min–1. The volume
of sample injection was 10 μL, running time was 5 min. The mass
spectrometry was performed in a negative ESI mode, m/z 417 and 420 being the two daughter ions for quantitative
tracing of the target.

Results and Discussion
Selection of anti-TBBPA
Phage-Displayed VHHs
The phage
display VHH library was panned in both homologous format with T5-BSA
and heterologous format with T1-BSA or T3-BSA. Both the concentrations
of coating antigens and TBBPA were gradually decreased in an attempt
to capture high-affinity binders. For all the selected phage clones
showing binding to the coating antigens T1-BSA, T3-BSA, and T5-BSA,
the 50% inhibition values of TBBPA in the competitive phage ELISA
varied in a range of 1.0–10 ng mL–1, <1.0
ng mL–1, and >10 ng mL–1, respectively.
Based on the sensitivities, the strongest binders, clones T1–4,
T3–15, and T5–10, were chosen from selections using
templates T1-BSA, T3-BSA, and T5-BSA, respectively. Since the structure
of T3 is similar to the immunizing hapten T5, all positive clones
had better binding ability with T3-BSA and T5-BSA than with other
coating antigens (T1-, T2-, T4-, and T6-BSA) (Table 1). T5–10 recognized most of the coating antigens except
T4-BSA which lacks the bromines while T3–15 only recognized
T3-BSA and T5-BSA (Table 1). The binding activity
of T5–10 is similar to that of the PAb previously produced
with immunogen T5-KLH.16 Hapten T6 with
the fragment of TBBPA was only recognized by T5–10. Since T1–4
was isolated from T1-BSA, this clone showed moderate binding ability
with both T1-BSA and T2-BSA that varied in linker length.

The
three VHHs showed different affinities to TBBPA, because the sensitivities
of VHH ELISAs (IC50) varied in a range of 0.41–7.5
ng mL–1 (Table 1). Clone
T5–10 from the homologous VHH panning system showed less sensitivity
than clones T1–4 and T3–15 from the heterologous VHH
panning system. It is possible that VHH T5–10 has higher binding
ability to the linker of coating antigens than VHH T1–4 and
VHH T3–15 and this nonspecific binding is difficult to inhibit
by free TBBPA. VHH T5–10 showed better selectivity for TBBPA
in the homologous assay with T5-BSA than in the heterologous assays
with T1-, T2-, T3-, and T6-BSA (Table 1), probably
more nonspecific binding presented in the heterologous format than
in the homologous one. VHH T1–4 may have less affinity to both
coating antigen T1-BSA and TBBPA because analogues T1 and T5 were
different in spatial configuration and linker length. Hapten T3 only
being two carbons shorter in the linker than hapten T5 would allow
VHHs to recognize TBBPA well with negligible recognition of the linker,
and the most sensitivity was observed in the combination of VHH T3–15
and T3-BSA (Table 1). Consequently, the most
sensitive assays were primarily determined by the heterologous antigen
selection, rather than coating antigens competitor optimization. Therefore,
T3-BSA was used as the coating antigen in both panning and testing
systems for the remaining studies.

The titer of the input phage
with T3-BSA selection in each cycle
was 1013 cfu mL–1, while the titer of
output phage gradually increased from 9.6 × 107 to
1.3 × 109 cfu mL–1 (Table S-1 in Supporting Information [SI]), showing an enrichment
of the specific phages. After the fourth round of panning, 16 clones
were selected, and all showed inhibition by TBBPA in the phage ELISA.
The DNA was isolated, and sequencing revealed five groups of amino
acid sequences. The VHH diversity38 partly
resulted from the extension of CDR1 and CDR3, antigen binding loops,
frequency of mutation, and the paratope diversity.24 Although there are only 12 amino acids or fewer in the
CDR3 of T1–4, T3–15, and T5–10 in our study (Figure
S-1 in SI) compared to the average 16 amino
acid length observed in llama VHH,39 the
VHH showed a complex repertoire and high inhibition by TBBPA. Showing
the highest sensitivity in the positive phage ELISAs, the phagemid
vector containing VHH T3–15 was transferred to top 10 F′
cells, and the expressed VHH was purified with a Ni-NTA affinity column.
The size and purity of VHH T3–15 were verified on a 15% SDS-PAGE
gel with one major band at MW 17 kD.

VHH Competitive ELISA for
TBBPA
TBBPA is a highly lipophilic
(log Kow = 4.5) compound and a water-miscible
cosolvent is necessary in the assay buffer for analysis. MeOH and
DMSO were reported to be efficient cosolvents for analyte–antibody
reactions40 and the effects of these solvents
on the VHH T3–15 assay performance were studied (Figure S-2
in SI). The increase of MeOH concentration
from 5% to 40% made the IC50 vary between 0.42 and 1.33
ng mL–1 (Figure S-2A in SI) and the maximal signal A0 declined
from 0.94 to 0.76. The most sensitive assay (IC50 = 0.42
ng mL–1) was observed at 10% MeOH with a reasonable A0 (0.9) and the least sensitive (IC50 = 1.33 ng mL–1) was at 40% MeOH, with a lower A0 (0.76). These data suggest that a high concentration
of MeOH may interfere with the VHH binding with both the coating antigen
and the target. The A0 of the assay declined
from 1.22 to 1.07 with the increasing of DMSO. The sensitivities in
5–40% of DMSO were in a range of 1.66–2.41 ng mL–1 (Figure S-2B in SI), lower
than those in MeOH. Thus, 10% MeOH, not only compatible with the VHH
affinity but also showing efficient solubility of TBBPA, was chosen
to optimize competitive VHH ELISAs.

The optimal concentrations
of coating antigen T3-BSA and VHH T3–15 were determined by
a checkerboard titration. Figure 2 is a typical
calibration curve of competitive VHH ELISA for TBBPA under optimized
conditions (10% MeOH, pH 7.4). The assay has a linear range (IC20–IC80) of 0.06–2.53 ng mL–1, with an IC50 value of 0.40 ng mL–1 and an IC10 value of 0.02 ng mL–1.
Compared to the heterologous competitive ELISA with alpaca antiserum
(IC50 = 500 ng mL–1), the sensitivity
was increased around 1000-fold in the VHH ELISA. In contrast with
ELISAs based on PAbs16 and mAbs,18 the sensitivities were increased approximately
2-fold and 9-fold, respectively. Instead of using the solubilized
VHH in the ELISA, displaying the VHH on phage particles showed a similar
sensitivity (IC50 = 0.46 ng mL–1) to
VHH ELISA, but a narrower linear range (0.19–1.07 ng mL–1) than the latter.

Cross-Reactivity
The specificity of the VHH T3–15
ELISA was evaluated by comparing the IC50 of TBBPA with
those of several TBBPA derivatives, including 2,2′,6,6′-tetrabromobisphenol
A diallyl ether (TBBPA-bAE) and tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
ether (TBBPA-bOHEE)s or other commonly used BFRs: hexabromocyclododecane
(HBCD), PBDEs (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, and BDE-183),
hydroxylated BDE-47 metabolites (5-OH-BDE-47 and 6-OH-BDE-47), 1,2-bis(pentabromodiphenyl)
ethane (DBDPE), and bisphenol A (BPA) (Figure S-3 in SI). As shown in Table 2, the VHH assay
is very selective for TBBPA because low cross-reactivities with the
other tested compounds were observed (<0.1%). The high selectivity
of the assay is useful to detect TBBPA which always coexists with
its nonbrominated metabolite BPA as well as HBCDs and PBDEs in environmental
matrices.10,13,14

VHH Characterization
It is reported that thermal stability
is one of the most extraordinary features of VHH.41 In this study, the VHH–antigen binding signal retained
about 80% and 20% of the unheated control signal after heating at
90 °C for 10 and 90 min, respectively (Figure S-4A in SI). It was reported that conventional mAbs lost
all binding activities within 5 min at 100 °C.41 The thermal stability of VHH could be explained by its
extreme plasticity allowing refolding from the denatured state.42 Another reason for this property is cysteines
forming in this case a disulfide bond, thus increasing thermal and
conformational stabilities.43 The thermal
stability of VHH makes it preferable to conventional antibodies for
on-site analysis.

The effect of the assay buffer pH on the VHH
ELISA was evaluated (Figure S-4B in SI).
The VHH ELISA was more susceptible to low pH (≤6.0) than to
high pH (7.4–11.0), because low A0 values were shown at pH 4.0 and 5.0 (0.2 and 0.3, respectively)
and a very high IC50 (8.2 ng mL–1) was
shown at pH 6.0, which may partly cause the denaturing of VHH. The
protonated state of the protein at low pH might contribute to protein
unfolding, or change surface charge or the antibody paratope. The
isoelectric point (pI) of VHH T3–15 was estimated to be 9.56
according to the protein sequence and ExPASy (http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/). When the pH of assay buffer was close to the pI of VHH T3–15,
some antibodies may have precipitated; thus, the A0 declined somewhat at pH 7.4–11.0 but the IC50 varied in a narrow range of 0.48–0.98 ng mL–1. The optimal pH of assay buffer was 7.4, but this assay was able
to be performed at pH ranging from 8.0 to 11.0, with little sensitivity
loss.

Assay Validation
Matrix effect, inevitable in sample
analysis, may cause some false positive results in the format used
and can be eliminated with the dilution of the extract. However, dilution
generally leads to a loss of assay sensitivity. For soil and FBS extracts,
a 100-fold dilution and a 10-fold dilution with PBS were needed to
minimize the matrix effect, respectively.

Extraction of TBBPA
from soil by sonication was a simple, effective and time-saving method.6 MeOH, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate, and
DCM/acetone (1:1, v/v) were initially tested. Ethyl acetate was proven
to be an ideal extraction solvent for TBBPA from soil due to the acceptable
recovery (Table 3). A reversed-phase solid
phase extraction cartridge was used to remove the hydrophilic contaminants
in FBS and extract the TBBPA from FBS with reasonable recoveries (Table 3).

The VHH ELISA for the spiked samples was
validated by comparing
the results of ELISA with those of an instrumental method LC–MS/MS.
The recoveries of TBBPA from soil and FBS determined by VHH ELISA
were in a range of 102.0–110.7% and 90.3–95.6%, respectively,
and by LC–MS/MS in a range of 92.6–96.6% and 90.8–92.5%,
respectively (Table 3). Recoveries in a range
of 75–125% are usually acceptable for spiked samples.44 Both methods showed good recoveries and correlated
well with each other (Figure S-5 in SI).
The VHH ELISA was demonstrated to be a valid method to detect TBBPA
in soil and serum.

Conclusion
This study presents a
novel heterologous antigen selection procedure
for VHHs against TBBPA and the resulting highly sensitive and selective
VHH-based immunoassay for TBBPA. Concern over TBBPA in the environmental
community is increasing rapidly due to its high-volume use, high levels
of human exposure, and resistance to both environmental degradation
and metabolism in animals. Thus, high throughput laboratory assays
and rugged field portable assays are needed. VHHs assays are increasing
in popularity as the basis of analytical procedures for proteins.
The monoclonal character, low cost, high selectivity and sensitivity,
and recombinant nature of VHH make them very attractive tools. However,
very few VHH-based assays have been developed for small-molecule analysis.

Using a heterologous coating antigen was in this case to be more
efficient in the selection of a sensitive and selective VHH than using
a homologous antigen. In general in small-molecule analysis heterologous
assays prove to be more sensitive, but the monoclonal character of
VHH-based assays raised the question if heterology was important for
VHH assays. The most sensitive VHH ELISA was based on the clone T3–15
selected from T3-BSA, with an IC50 of 0.4 ng mL–1. This assay was highly selective for TBBPA with negligible cross-reactivities
to TBBPA derivatives and other BFR compounds, which is suitable for
determining TBBPA even at lower levels in complicated environmental
samples. The VHH-based ELISA for TBBPA spiked in soil and FBS samples
showed good correlation with LC–MS/MS therefore can be used
as a supplemental or alternative method for chemical detection. Taking
advantage of its small size, solubility, thermal stability, pH tolerance,
and ease of production, the VHH would be a useful tool to monitor
TBBPA in the abiotic and biotic samples.
