Mass transport in
fluidic channels under conditions of pressure-driven
flow is controlled by a combination of convection and diffusion. For
electrochemical measurements the height of a channel is typically
of the same order of magnitude as the electrode dimensions, resulting
in complex two- or three- dimensional concentration distributions.
Electrochemical nanofluidic devices, however, can have such a low
height-to-length ratio that they can effectively be considered as
one-dimensional. This greatly simplifies the modeling and quantitative
interpretation of analytical measurements. Here we study mass transport
in nanochannels using electrodes in a generator-collector configuration.
The flux of redox molecules is monitored amperometrically. We observe
the transition from diffusion-dominated to convection-dominated transport
by varying both the flow velocity and the distance between the electrodes.
These results are described quantitatively by the one-dimensional
Nernst–Planck equation for mass transport over the full range
of experimentally accessible parameters.

==== Body
In an electrochemical
generator-collector
measurement, species that are reduced or oxidized at a generator electrode
are converted back to their original state at a collector electrode.
An early illustration of this principle was introduced in 1959 and
consisted of a rotating disk electrode surrounded by a concentric
ring electrode, the two electrodes being separated by a dielectric
layer.1 Double electrodes in channel flow,
consisting of two closely spaced flat electrodes embedded into the
wall of a channel through which the sample flowed, appeared shortly
afterward.2 More recently, double electrodes
in a channel were applied for the study of electrode dissolution processes,3−6 mechanisms and kinetics of electrochemical reactions7−13 and in situ velocimetry.14−18 Understanding mass transport in these systems became
an important issue from the beginning, demanding complex calculations
to account for complex geometries and different transport mechanisms.19−25 Further miniaturization resulted in microchannel structures that
allowed simplification to a two-dimensional description because mass
transport becomes essentially uniform in the third dimension. However,
the interplay between diffusion and convection, where changes in flow
velocity alter the concentration profile in two dimensions, can remain
highly nontrivial to quantify.

Here we employ nanofluidic devices
in which the ratio between channel
height and electrode length effectively removes one more dimension.
This significantly simplifies the description of mass transport to
the one-dimensional Nernst–Planck equation. To our knowledge,
no electrochemical double-electrode systems with one-dimensional concentration
distributions in the full accessible fluid velocity range were introduced
previously.

Three main parameters characterize the nature of
the analyte transport
inside the nanochannel. The first parameter is the transverse Peclet
number, Pet, which indicates how efficient
diffusion is at mixing molecules across the height of the nanochannel
during advective transport. Its value is given by Pet = vh/D, where D is the diffusion coefficient of redox active species, v is the average flow velocity and h is
the height of the channel. Typical values of the parameters, h = 100 nm, D = 10–9 m2/s and v = 1000 μm/s yield Pet = 0.1. This indicates that the diffusion
across the nanochannel happens sufficiently fast that the parabolic
shape of the laminar Poisseuille flow profile is effectively sampled.
We can thus consider that all molecules are advected with the same
velocity along the channel.

A second parameter, the Graetz number
(Gz), also
compares diffusion perpendicular to the nanochannel with convection
along it, but at the length scales characteristic for each direction.
It is the ratio of the time for a redox molecule to diffuse vertically
across the nanochannel to the advection time along a length L. Here the importance of the high ratio between electrode
length and channel height comes to light. For L =
10 μm and v = 1000 μm/s, which is maximum
velocity used in the experiment, Gz = Peth/L = 10–3. This indicates that in a nanochannel the
vertical mass transport equilibrates essentially instantly on the
time and length scales over which longitudinal transport takes place
for typical dimensions and all (realistic) flow rates. This is a crucial
difference with microchannels, where flow alters the concentration
profile in both longitudinal and perpendicular directions, as sketched
in Figure 1. A low
value of Gz allows utilizing a one-dimensional description
for calculating redox species concentrations in the nanochannel, in
contrast with microchannels where two dimensions must be considered.

representation of concentration profiles under high
flow rate conditions for (a) a nanochannel and (b) a microchannel.
The white arrows represent the flow direction.

The third parameter is of particular interest here as it characterizes
the dominant form of interaction between the electrodes. Transport
of analyte along the nanochannel involves both diffusion and convection
caused by externally applied pressure. The longitudinal Peclet number, Pel = vs/D (where s is the spacing between the electrodes), describes the
ratio of each component’s contribution. When it is much lower
than one, diffusion dominates over convection, while in the opposite
limit transport along the channel is controlled by convection. In
the experiments described herein we will access both of these regimes
by controlling v and s.

Materials and
Methods
A sketch of our fluidic system is depicted in Figure 2a. It consists of
a nanochannel
with two electrodes embedded in its floor and a microchannel connected
in parallel. While the measurements take place in the nanochannel,
the presence of the microchannel facilitates fluid handling and allows
replacing solutions in reasonable time. We call ’upstream’
and ’downstream’ the electrodes closest to the fluid
inlet and outlet, respectively.

system consisting of
a SiO2 nanochannel (pink) with embedded Pt electrodes (yellow)
and a PDMS microchannel in parallel (white). Not drawn to scale: in
the experiment the nanochannel length and the microchannel height
were ∼1000 and 33 times the nanochannel height, respectively.

as the PDMS microstructure bonded on top. The structures are imaged
through the PDMS. The regularly spaced squares are support pillars
for the large access channels that lead to external fluidic connections.

Nanofluidic Device
The nanochannel was fabricated in
a manner analogous to a previously reported process for nanogap electrodes.26 In short, a Si wafer with thermally grown 500
nm SiO2 was taken as substrate. The 20 nm thick Pt electrodes
and connecting wires were defined by photolithography using photoresist
OIR 907-12 and deposited by e-beam evaporation. These electrodes had
a length of 11 μm and were separated by 2, 5, or 50 μm.
A Cr sacrificial layer 86 μm long, 5 μm wide, and 90 nm
high was then patterned on top of the electrodes with the same techniques
to define the shape of the nanochannel. The entire wafer including
the metal structures was then passivated with a layer of SiO2 using chemical vapor deposition to isolate the leading wires from
the analyte. Finally, two holes were created through the dielectric
layer by reactive plasma etching to provide access to the Cr sacrificial
layer. Immediately prior to an experiment, the Cr was removed with
a wet etchant (Selectipur, BASF) to release the nanochannel. This
procedure took 40–80 min, following which the chip was flushed
with water and dried in a flow of nitrogen.

Microfluidic Channels
A microfluidic structure was
formed on the bottom of a block of polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) using
a lithographically patterned SU-8 mold. This structure consisted of
two microchannels, each 90 μm long, 5 μm wide, and 3 μm
high, connecting two large reservoirs. Punching holes through the
PDMS in the regions of the large reservoirs allowed inserting polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) microtubes for external connections. To create the micro/nanochannel
assembly, each chip was placed inside a plasma cleaner following release
of the nanochannel together with a PDMS block and treated with oxygen
plasma at 1 mbar for 70 s to activate the surfaces for bonding. The
microstructure on the PDMS block was then aligned with the nanogap
device under a microscope and pressed against the chip. The assembled
system was thereafter placed in an oven at 70 °C for 15–20
min to enhance bonding strength. After this, we placed the chip with
its assembled microfluidic structure in a custom probe station and
inserted microtubes into the inlet and outlet holes. An image of the
complete structure is shown in Figure 2b.

Flow control
The inlet of the device
was connected
to a 500 μL ILS microsyringe driven by a syringe pump (Pump
11 Pico Plus Elite) and the outlet to a reservoir with a Ag/AgCl reference
electrode (BASi, MF 2079, RE-5B) immersed in it. According to Poiseuille’s
law, the pressure difference Δp caused by a
flow rate Qtotal in such a system is defined
as Δp = QtotalRtotal, where Rtotal is the total hydraulic resistance. For a channel with a rectangular
cross-section, an estimate of this value is27 1  where h, w, and L are the height, width, and length of the
channel, respectively, and η is the dynamic viscosity of water.
The total flow rate is divided between the micro- and nanochannels
in an inverse proportion to their hydraulic resistances such that 2  

For the channel geometries
employed
here, the maximum velocity in the nanochannel is about 1000 μm/s,
which corresponds to Reynolds number 10–4. Hence,
even for our highest operational velocities, the flow remains laminar.

Chemicals
All further chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water with
a resistivity of 18.2 Ω cm. We used aqueous solution of 1 mm
Fc(MeOH)2 and 0.1 M KCl as supporting electrolyte. Fc(MeOH)2 was selected as a near-ideal reversible, outer sphere redox
couple so as to concentrate on mass transport. Fc(MeOH)2 in its reduced form is a neutral species. Slight partial oxidation
is however possible due to acid left over in the microfluidic system.28

Measurement protocol
Prior to measurements,
the electrodes
were cleaned with H2SO4 until the cyclic voltammetry
pattern became reproducible and corresponded to the characteristic
voltammogram expected for clean Pt. The two electrodes were first
appointed the roles of generator and collector and a constant pump
rate was applied. Initially, both generator and collector were at
highly reducing overpotentials (0 V vs Ag/AgCl) and any residual currents
were considered as baseline. We then applied a potential step to the
generator electrode to an highly oxidizing overpotential (0.5 V vs
Ag/AgCl) and measured both the oxidation current at this electrode
(generator current) and the reduction current at the second electrode
(collector current). The steady-state values of these currents during
the potential step period and following baseline subtraction yielded
the reported generator and collector currents. The pump rate was then
switched to the next flow rate. After completing a set of measurements,
the inlet and outlet were swapped and the measurements were repeated
for the same range of flow rates. The role of each electrode as generator
or collector remained the same, however the upstream electrode became
downstream and vice versa. The corresponding results are represented
as negative flow velocities.

Results and Discussion
Collector
Current
Figure 3 shows amperometric data measured at the
collector elecrode upon applying a square potential pulse of 120 s
duration to the generator electrode. The negative sign of the current
corresponds to the reduction of species that were earlier oxidized
at the generator electrode. After a short transient, the collector
current settled to a steady-state plateau value. The magnitude of
the current increased with increasing flow rate when the collector
was located downstream of the generator, while the opposite trend
was observed when the collector was located upstream of the generator.

Figure 3 Amperometric
traces for the reduction current at the collector
for several flow velocities when the generator was located (a) upstream
and (b) downstream of the collector. This device had a spacing between
the electrodes of s = 5 μm.

Figure 4 shows
the
collector current as a function of flow rate for devices with electrode
spacings of 2 μm, 5 and 50 μm. For an upstream collector
electrode (negative velocity) the current was suppressed at high flow
speeds, while at sufficiently high positive flow rates the collector
current became approximately linear with flow speed. The transition
between these two regimes became increasingly sharp with increasing
spacing between the two electrodes, while the collector current at
low flow rates increased with decreasing electrode spacing.

Figure 4 Collector currents
versus flow rate. Experimental data (symbols)
and solutions to the Nernst–Planck equation (solid lines).
Positive and negative velocities correspond to the collector being
located downstream and upstream from the generator, respectively.

This behavior results from two factors. With increasing
flow rate,
mass transport to the generator is enhanced and the generation rate
increases. When the collector is located downstream, advection and
diffusion work in tandem and this translates into an increased collection
rate. When the collector is located upstream, on the other hand, only
diffusion contributes to bringing oxidized molecules to the collector.
At high enough flow rates convection dominates and the current to
the collector diminishes. Finally, at low flow rates the dominant
form of transport between the two electrodes is diffusion. Counterpropagating
gradients of oxidized and reduced species are then created (so-called
redox cycling). Smaller electrode spacings lead to steeper concentration
gradients and hence to larger collector currents.

This intuitive
interpretation can be formalized using the Nernst–Planck
equation for mass transport. Since the Graetz number Gz ≪ 1,
the distribution of species in the transverse directions is essentially
independent of the flow rate and we can describe the longitudinal
flux using the one-dimensional Nernst–Planck equation in the
steady state, 3  where by mass conservation 4  

Here the index “ox” indicates that we refer to the
oxidized form and cox(x) is the local concentration of oxidized molecules. The value for
the diffusion coefficient of oxidized Fc(MeOH)2, Dox, is taken as 5.4 × 10–10 m2/s.29

Due to the extremely
low Graetz number, molecules interact with
an electrode as soon as they reach its longitudinal position along
the channel. All molecules entering the volume above the generator
electrode are thus oxidized, and they are turned back into the reduced
form when they reach the boundary of the collector electrode:  Here cb is bulk
concentration of redox species and x is the position
measured from the center of the channel. The solution is easily obtained
analytically as 5  as can be verified by direct substitution
into eq 3 and eq 4. Calculated concentration
profiles for different flow rates are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Calculated concentration distribution of oxidized
species in the
space between the generator and collector electrodes for different
flow rates. This shows the qualitative difference between the diffusion-limited
regime (Pel ≪ 1, red) and convection-limited
regime (Pel ≫ 1, blue).

The concentration profile of eq 5 corresponds to a flux of oxidized species at the collector 6  and a current 7  

Here n = 1 is the number of electrons transferred
per oxidation or reduction event, F is the Faraday
constant, and A is the cross-sectional area of the
nanochannel.

The predicted trends are consistent with the experimental
data
of Figure 4. In the
regime Pel ≪ 1, corresponding to
low flow rates, mass transport is dominated by diffusion and the current
is inversely proportional to the spacing between the electrodes:  

This corresponds to a diffusion-limited
redox cycling current.
In the convection-dominated regime Pel ≫ 1, the collector current at the downstream electrode is
controlled primarily by the bulk concentration and the flow velocity:  

Finally, for the collector current
at the upstream electrode and
a large negative value of Pel, the current
is exponentially suppressed and we have  

Theoretical curves based on eq 7 are shown in Figure 4. The crossover value of Pel = 1 is reached for electrode spacings 2, 5, and 50 μm at velocities
of 270, 180, and 18 μm/s, respectively. Consistent with the
experiment, the current near zero fluid velocity scales as 1/s and at high velocities the dependence on velocity becomes
linear.

Some scatter in the experimental data is however observed.
We attribute
this mainly to uncertainties in the flow velocity, which is highly
sensitive to the dimensions of nano- and microchannels. While our
mathematical model considers these to have a constant and well-defined
shape and size, they may differ slightly due to inaccuracies in the
fabrication process and deformation of the PDMS channels over the
course of the experiments. For example, it was shown previously30,31 that at high flow rates the actual velocity can be 30% smaller than
the calculated value. Small PDMS particles can also get into the microchannel
during measurements and temporally alter the flow velocity.

Within the accuracy imposed by this scatter, the good agreement
between theory and experiment allows concluding that mass transport
is well described by the Nernst–Planck equation (eq 3). This supports the assumption
that the faradaic current is dominated by mass transport in solution
and that surface transport of adsorbed redox species has at most a
marginal effect on the total current.

Generator Current
Figure 6 shows the
steady-state generator current
as a function of average fluid velocity and electrode separation.
The generator current is largely symmetric around v = 0 and increases with increasing flow speed.

Figure 6 Generator currents. Experimental
data (scatter) and solution of
Nernst–Planck equation (solid lines).

As illustrated in Figure 7, the generator electrode collects reduced species from two
sources: the collector electrode and the inlet or outlet of the nanochannel.
It is a good approximation to consider these two fluxes separately
as they are directed to the generator electrode from two opposite
directions. Each flux can be independently estimated from the one-dimensional
Nernst–Planck equation. Here, however, we use the value of
the diffusion coefficient for the reduced form of Fc(MeOH)2, Dred = 6.7 × 10–10 m2/s:29 8  

Figure 7 Fluxes of reduced
molecules to the generator electrode: J1 from the bulk solution outside the nanogap
device and J2 from the collector electrode
via redox cycling.

The boundary conditions
are also analogous:  

Here laccess is the distance between
the inlet/outlet and the generator electrode, x1 refers to the position between the inlet/outlet and the generator
electrode, and x2 to the position between
the two electrodes. The solution yields for the current 9  

This expression is expressed in terms of v rather
than Pel to avoid confusion since the
two contributions have different values of Pel.

The predictions of eq 9 are compared to the experimental data in Figure 6. The theoretical
curves capture the experimental
trend, but the actual values have a systematic offset of ∼+20
pA. As discussed in the Supporting Information, this error is attributed to leakage through the passivation layer
protecting the wires connecting the electrodes to outer contact pads.
This leakage did not affect the reduction current at the collector
electrode as oxidized molecules are produced inside the nanochannel
at the generator electrode.

Conclusion
We
examined mass transport in nanochannels in a generator-collector
configuration both experimentally and theoretically. The low Gz number allowed us to use an effective 1D model for the
mathematical description of this system, and the experimental results
correspond well with the calculated curves. Closely spaced electrodes
can exhibit significant cross-talk by means of diffusion, while for
sufficiently distant electrodes only convection is relevant.
