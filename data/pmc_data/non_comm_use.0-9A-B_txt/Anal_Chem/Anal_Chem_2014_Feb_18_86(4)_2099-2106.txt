Structural characterization of protein
complexes is essential for
the understanding of their function and regulation. However, it remains
challenging due to limitations in existing tools. With recent technological
improvements, cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has become a
powerful strategy to define protein–protein interactions and
elucidate structural topologies of protein complexes. To further advance
XL-MS studies, we present here the development of new isotope-coded
MS-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linkers: d0- and d10-labeled dimethyl disuccinimidyl
sulfoxide (DMDSSO). Detailed characterization of DMDSSO cross-linked
peptides further demonstrates that sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable
cross-linkers offer robust and predictable MS2 fragmentation of cross-linked
peptides, permitting subsequent MS3 analysis for simplified, unambiguous
identification. Concurrent usage of these reagents provides a characteristic
doublet pattern of DMDSSO cross-linked peptides, thus aiding in the
confidence of cross-link identification by MSn analysis. More importantly, the unique isotopic profile permits
quantitative analysis of cross-linked peptides and therefore expands
the capability of XL-MS strategies to analyze both static and dynamic
protein interactions. Together, our work has established a new XL-MS
workflow for future studies toward the understanding of structural
dynamics of protein complexes.

==== Body
Protein complexes
represent
essential functional entities in cells for carrying out multiple biological
processes including translation, replication, cell division, and cell
cycle control. Protein–protein interactions are integral in
modulating the assembly, structure, and function of protein complexes.
Perturbations of endogenous protein–protein interactions can
result in deleterious effects on cellular activities and lead to human
disease. In recent years, protein–protein interaction interfaces
have become a new and attractive platform for therapeutics.1 Therefore, characterization of structures and
interaction dynamics of protein complexes is critical to understanding
their function and regulation, thus unraveling molecular mechanisms
underlying human pathologies and providing insight on potential targets
for drug development. Traditional structural tools such as nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography are able to yield
detailed, high-resolution information on protein structures. However,
these technologies have difficulty in analyzing heterogeneous and
dynamic protein complexes. Following decades of method development
alongside technological advances in mass spectrometry, cross-linking
mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has emerged as a powerful strategy not only
for mapping protein interaction networks2−4 but also for structural
elucidation of protein complexes.5−8 The cross-links between proteins can be
used to derive topological ordering of protein complexes by computational
modeling.8,9 In addition, spatial distances between cross-linked
residues can be converted to distance restraints for protein homology
modeling.6

The major challenges in
XL-MS studies are the detection of low-abundance
cross-linked peptides and their unambiguous identification. The complexity
in peptide mixtures often impedes MS detection of cross-linked peptides
due to the presence of significantly more abundant noncross-linked
peptides. In addition, heterogeneous populations of cross-linked products,
i.e., interlinked, intralinked, and dead-end modified peptides further
complicates the analysis. To facilitate the detection of cross-linked
peptides, one strategy is to selectively enrich cross-linked products
for MS analysis using enrichable cross-linkers containing either an
affinity tag (e.g., biotin tag)10,11 or a chemical handle
that allows subsequent addition of an affinity tag through chemical
conjugation.12 Another strategy is to incorporate
stable isotopes in cross-linked peptides to generate characteristic
isotopic profiles, thus separating them from noncross-linked peptides.6,7,10,13−16 This differentiation can be achieved by first carrying out enzymatic
digestion of cross-linked proteins in 16O and 18O water, respectively, and then mixing prior to MS analysis.13 Although effective, enzymatic incorporation
of 18O is troublesome as its labeling efficiency relies
heavily on peptide sequences. Interestingly, performing protein cross-linking
in 18O water can result in the incorporation of one 18O to dead-end modified peptides but not to other types of
peptides, thus effectively distinguishing them from intralinked and
interlinked peptides.10 However, a common
practice to produce cross-linked peptides as isotopic pairs for easy
identification is to cross-link proteins with a 1:1 mixture of nonlabeled
and labeled cross-linkers.6,7,14−17

Apart from the detection of cross-linked peptides, unambiguous
identification of interlinked peptides by peptide sequencing is challenging
when noncleavable cross-linkers are used. This is due to the difficulty
in interpreting convoluted tandem mass spectra resulted from the fragmentation
of two interlinked peptides. Despite recent innovation in bioinformatics
tools that have been developed to better dissect fragmentation data
of interlinked peptides,18−22 further improvements are required to make it as generally applicable
as that for identifying single peptide sequences. To circumvent these
problems, various types of cleavable cross-linkers, e.g., MS-, photo-,
and chemical-cleavable reagents, have been developed to facilitate
MS identification of cross-linked peptides. Among them, MS-cleavable
reagents appear to be most attractive for XL-MS studies,11,12,17,23,24 owing to their unique capability of fragmenting
cross-links during collision-induced dissociation (CID) and thus facilitating
subsequent peptide sequencing for unambiguous identification. Recently,
we have developed a novel MS-cleavable homobifunctional NHS ester,
disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), in which the MS-cleavable C–S
bond cleaves preferentially during MS2 analysis prior to the breakage
of the peptide backbone.12 This cleavage
permits robust, reliable, and characteristic CID-induced fragmentation
of cross-linked peptides unique to their cross-linking types, generating
distinct MS2 fragment ions for subsequent MS3 sequencing. This novel
integrated workflow has proven to be effective for fast and accurate
identification of cross-linked peptides using conventional bioinformatics
tools and has been successfully applied to elucidate structures of
proteasome complexes.8,12

To further advance XL-MS
studies of protein complexes, we have
developed a pair of new isotope-coded DSSO derivatives, i.e., d0- and d10-labeled
dimethyl-disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DMDSSO). Incorporation of deuterium
labeling into our robust sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linker
adds new features that not only enhance the detection and identification
of cross-linked peptides but also provide the capability of quantifying
cross-linked peptides. Here we present the detailed characterization
of DMDSSO-based cross-linking strategy using synthetic peptides and
model protein cytochrome C. We have compared MSn analyses of d0- and d10-DMDSSO cross-linked peptides and performed quantitative
assessments of cross-linked peptides with different sample preparation
strategies.

Experimental Procedures
Materials and Reagents
General chemicals
were purchased
from Fisher Scientific or VWR International, bovine heart cytochrome
C (98% purity) from Sigma-Aldrich, and Ac-Myelin peptide (Ac-ASQKRPSQRHG,
92.7% purity) from American Peptide (Sunnyvale, CA).

Synthesis and
Characterization of d0-DMDSSO and d10-DMDSSO
The synthesis
of DMDSSO was depicted in Figure 1. Briefly,
the preparation of d0-DMDSSO began with
addition of thioacetic acid to methyl methacrylate. Methanol and triethylamine
were added to the mixture along with another equivalent of methyl
methacrylate to afford the symmetrical diester in one pot. The diester
was hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide in THF/H2O before
coupling with NHS, in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride, pyridine,
and DMF.25 Lastly, oxidation of the sulfide
to the sulfoxide yielded the desired linker as described.12 The preparation of d10-DMDSSO was carried out similarly, beginning with commercially available d8-methyl methacrylate. The details of the chemical
characterization are described in the Supporting
Information.

Figure 1 Chemical synthesis schemes for (A) d0-DMDSSO and (B) d10-DMDSSO.

Cross-Linking of Synthetic
Peptides with d0- and d10-DMDSSO
Synthetic
peptide Ac-Myelin was dissolved in DMSO to 1 mM and cross-linked with
either d0- or d10-DMDSSO in a 1:1 molar ratio of peptide to cross-linker in the presence
of 1 equiv of diisopropylethylamine. The resulting samples were diluted
to 5 pmol/μL in 3% ACN/2% formic acid for MS analysis.

Cross-Linking
of Cytochrome C with d0- and d10-DMDSSO
A volume of
40 μL of 200 μM cytochrome C in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was
reacted with d0- or d10-DMDSSO in a molar ratio of 1:10 (protein–cross-linker)
for 2 h at room temperature and quenched with excess ammonium bicarbonate.
Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie
blue. The dimerized bands were excised, reduced with TCEP for 30 min,
and alkylated with chloroacetamide for 45 min in the dark, and then
digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. Peptide digests were
extracted, concentrated, and reconstituted in 3% ACN/2% formic acid
for MS analysis.

Liquid Chromatography–Multistage Tandem
Mass Spectromtery
(LC MSn)
DMDSSO cross-linked
peptides were analyzed by LC–MSn utilizing an LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) coupled
online with an Eksigent NanoLC system (Dublin, CA) as previously described.12 Each MSn experiment
has a duty cycle of 1.3 s, consisting of one MS scan in FT mode (350–1400 m/z, resolution of 60 000 at m/z 400) followed by two data-dependent
MS2 scans in FT mode (resolution of 7500) with normalized collision
energy at 15% on the top two MS peaks with charges at 3+ or up, and
three MS3 scans in the LTQ with normalized collision energy at 35%
on the top three peaks from each MS2.

Data Analysis of Cross-Linked
Peptides
Data processing
of LC–MSn spectra was carried out
as described.12 MS3 data was subjected
to a developmental version of Protein Prospector (v. 5.10.10) for
database searching, using Batch-Tag against cytochrome C sequence
(SwissProt accession no. P62894) with mass tolerances for parent
ions and fragment ions set as ±20 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively.
Trypsin was set as the enzyme with four maximum missed cleavages allowed.
Protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, N-terminal conversion
of glutamine to pyroglutamic acid, asparagine deamidation, and cysteine
carbamidomethylation were selected as variable modifications. In addition,
three defined modifications on uncleaved lysines and free protein
N-termini were selected: alkene (A, C4H4O, +
68 Da; or A*, C4H–1D5O, +
73 Da), sulfenic acid (S, C4H6O2S,
+ 118 Da; or S*, C4H1D5O2S, + 123 Da), and unsaturated thiol (T, C4H4OS, + 100 Da; or T*, C4H–1D5OS, + 105 Da) modification, due to remnant moieties for d0- (i.e., A, S, T) or d10-DMSSO
(i.e., A*, S*, T*) cross-linker, respectively. Initial acceptance
criteria for peptide identification required a reported expectation
value ≤0.1.

MS-Bridge was used to confirm the identification
of cross-linked peptides by mass mapping against bovine cytochrome
C with the parent mass error set as ±10 ppm.12 The in-house program Link-Hunter is a revised version of
the previously written Link-Finder program, designed to automatically
validate and summarize cross-linked peptides based on MSn data and database searching results as previously
described.8,12

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis of New Isotope-Coded DSSO Derivatives
In order
to further facilitate MS identification of cross-linked
peptides and allow quantitative determination of structural dynamics
of protein complexes, we aimed to generate deuterium labeled MS-cleavable
cross-linkers. Given our previous success of DSSO-based XL-MS strategies
in protein structural characterization,8,12 we first attempted
to produce d4-DSSO by introducing deuterium
at the positions alpha to the carbonyls through deuterium exchange
(Supplementary Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). Although feasible, complete labeling was problematic due to slow
exchange. Additionally, labeling with four deuteriums proved to be
insufficient for effective separation of highly charged d0/d4-DSSO cross-linked peptide
pairs (4+ and above) during MSn analysis.
Therefore, d8-labeled DSSO would be ideal;
however, incorporation of eight deuteriums in DSSO appeared to be
less practical due to cost and experimental difficulties. To circumvent
this problem, we have designed a new derivative of DSSO, dimethyl
disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DMDSSO). With the commercial availability
of methyl methacrylate and d8-methyl methacrylate,
the synthesis of d0- or d10-DMDSSO is economical and straightforward (Figure 1). Similar to DSSO, DMDSSO also has an ideal length
(an average extended length of 9.3 Å) for structural proteomics
studies.

Expected CID Fragmentation Patterns of d0- and d10-DMDSSO Cross-linked
Peptides
Three types of cross-linked products can result
from the digestion of cross-linked proteins: interlinked, intralinked,
and dead-end modified peptides. Previously we have shown that DSSO
cross-linked peptides display characteristic fragmentation patterns
during MS2 analysis due to preferential cleavage of CID-cleavable
C–S bonds adjacent to the sulfoxide.12 Aside from two additional methyl groups, DMDSSO has a structure
very similar to DSSO, with two symmetric MS-cleavable C–S bonds.
Therefore, we expect that DMDSSO cross-linked peptides will display
the same characteristic MS2 fragmentation patterns as DSSO cross-linked
peptides. Since deuterium labeling should not interfere with peptide
fragmentation, d0- and d10-DMDSSO cross-linked peptides would behave similarly
during MSn analysis. For simplicity, we
use d0-DMDSSO cross-linked peptides to
illustrate their predicted fragmentation patterns (Figure 2). Prior to peptide backbone fragmentation, MS2
analysis selectively cleaves either of the two symmetric C–S
bonds in the linker region of DMDSSO cross-linked peptides, yielding
peptide fragments with predictable modifications (due to the remnants
of DMDSSO) on cross-linked lysine residues. For a d0-DMDSSO interlinked peptide α–β, cleavage
of a C–S bond leads to physical separation of the two interlinked
peptides into a pair of peptide fragments (i.e., αA/βS or αS/βA),
in which α and β peptide fragments are modified by two
complementary cross-linker remnant moieties, i.e., alkene (A) and
sulfenic acid (S) (Figure 2A). Thus, the resulting
MS2 peptide fragments can be subjected to MS3 sequencing for unambiguous
identification of interlinked peptides.12 For a d0-DMDSSO intralinked peptide
αintra, one peptide fragment (i.e., αA+S) is anticipated, carrying an alkene- and a sulfenic acid-modified
lysine, respectively (Figure 2B). This MS2
fragment ion αA+S actually represents two different
ion species that have identical peptide sequences and m/z values but transposed DMDSSO remnant-modified
lysine residues. For a d0-DMDSSO dead-end
modified peptide (αDN), two peptide fragments (i.e.,
αA and αS) are expected (Figure 2C). It is noted that the sulfenic acid moiety often
undergoes dehydration to become a more stable and dominant unsaturated
thiol moiety (i.e., T, + 100 Da) as previously described (Figure 2D).12 This conversion
does not appear to complicate data analysis as observed for DSSO cross-linked
peptides.12 In comparison to d0-DMDSSO cross-linked peptides, fragmentation patterns
of d10-DMDSSO cross-linked peptides should
be the same except all of the d10-DMDSSO
remnants (i.e., A*, alkene; S*, sulfenic acid; or T*, unsaturated
thiol) are 5 Da higher in mass due to the presence of 5 deuteriums
after cleaving the C–S bond (Figure 2E). In addition to distinct MS2 fragmentation patterns, DMDSSO cross-linked
peptides have fixed mass relationships between parent ions and their
respective fragment ions, similar to those of DSSO cross-linked peptides,12 thus providing an additional confirmation of
the identified cross-linked peptides at the MS2 level. Together with
MS3 sequencing and MS1 mass matching, three different types of evidence
can be obtained for the identification of DMDSSO cross-linked peptides
with significantly improved confidence and accuracy.

Characterization of DMDSSO
Cross-Linked Model Peptides by MSn Analysis
We first performed DMDSSO
cross-linking on synthetic peptide Ac-Myelin. Under our experimental
conditions, the resulting cross-linked products were primarily interlinked
Ac-Myelin homodimer (α–α), which were detected
as a series of multiply charged ions for d0-DMDSSO (m/z 462.90336+, 555.28225+, 693.84974+) and d10-DMDSSO (m/z 464.57966+, 557.29515+, 696.36564+), respectively
(Figure 3A,E). There is a 10 Da mass difference
between d0- and d10-labeled cross-linked peptides due to incorporation of 10
deuteriums in d10-DMDSSO. As shown in
Figure 3B, MS2 analysis of the sextuply charged d0-interlinked Ac-Myelin (d0, α–α6+) yielded a pair of dominant
fragment ions (αA/αT), demonstrating
effective separation of the interlinked homodimer as expected. Similarly,
the αA*/αT* ion pair was also detected
as the most abundant ions in MS2 spectrum for d10-interlinked Ac-Myelin peptide (d10, α–α6+) (Figure 3F), indicating no interference from deuterium labeling. MS2 analyses
of quadruply- and quintuply-charged Ac-Myelin peptides also resulted
in one pair of fragment ions (d0, αA/αS; d10, αA*/αS*) (Figure 3C,D,G,H),
in which αS or αS* appears to be
more dominant than αT or αT*, respectively,
in contrast to the fragmentation of sextuply charged interlinked peptides
(Figure 3B,F). This observation may be due
to the susceptibility of highly charged species to fragmentation when
the same energy is applied to all precursor ions during CID analysis
regardless of their charge. Such fragmentation behavior was previously
observed for DSSO interlinked Ac-Myelin peptides as well.12 MS3 sequencing of αA, αT, αA*, and αT* fragment
ions confirmed the peptide sequences of d0- and d10-interlinked Ac-Myelin peptides
unambiguously (Supplementary Figure 2 in the Supporting
Information), and none of the DMDSSO remnants appear to complicate
peptide sequencing by MS3. Taken together, the results have proven
that addition of methyl substituents in the linker region does not
change the unique fragmentation of sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable
cross-linked peptides, and the preferential cleavage of C–S
bonds is independent of peptide charges. Thus, MSn analysis of DMDSSO cross-linked peptides can be performed
the same way as that of DSSO cross-linked peptides.12

Characterization of DMDSSO
Cross-Linked Cytochrome C by MSn Analysis
We next evaluated the
applicability of d0- and d10-DMDSSO for protein cross-linking. Model protein cytochrome
C has been extensively used to test various new cross-linking strategies
due to the large number of lysine residues relative to its size.12,26 In this work, DMDSSO cross-linked cytochrome C was separated by
1-D SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. In comparison
to DSSO, d0- and d10-DMDSSO showed comparable efficiency in protein cross-linking
(Supplementary Figure 3 in the Supporting Information). The general workflow for analyzing cross-linked cytochrome C is
illustrated in Figure 4. As shown, we first
analyzed in-gel digests of d0- and d10-DMDSSO dimerized cytochrome C separately.
Figure 5A,D displays the respective MS2 spectra
of a selected pair of d0- and d10-DMDSSO interlinked cytochrome C peptides
(m/z 574.64363+, 577.99933+), in which two pairs of peptide fragment ions (d0, αA/βT and αT/βA; d10, αA*/βT* and αT*/βA*) were detected, demonstrating characteristic fragmentation pattern
of interlinked heterodimeric peptides. The most dominant fragment
pair ions, αA/βT for d0- and αA*/βT* for d10-labeled interlinked peptides, were subsequently
subjected to MS3 analysis (Figure 5BC,E,F).
On the basis of the series of y and b ions detected, the sequences
of αA (m/z 415.762+) and αA* (m/z, 418.282+) were determined as KAIFQVK and
KA*IFQVK, respectively, in which the N-terminal K is modified
with the alkene moiety. Similarly, MS3 analysis of the corresponding
βT (m/z 874.40)
and βT* (m/z 879.43)
identified their sequences as Ac-GDVEKTGK and Ac-GDVEKT*GK, respectively, where the K at the fifth position from
N-terminus is modified with the thiol moiety. Together with mass mapping
of the parent ions using MS-Bridge, the interlinked peptides were
unambiguously determined as [Ac-1GDVEKGK7 interlinked
to 8KIFQVK13], in which a cross-link was formed
between K5 and K8 in cytochrome C.

identification of d0/d10 DMDSSO cross-linked

In addition to interlinked peptides, we have also identified
DMDSSO
intralinked and dead-end modified cytochrome C peptides, and their
MS2 fragmentation patterns are the same as depicted in Figure 2. For example, MS2 analysis of a selected d0-intralinked cytochrome C peptide (m/z 621.32033+) yielded a single
dominant fragment ion (αA+T, m/z 615.323+) (Supplementary Figure 4A in the Supporting Information). Similarly, its corresponding d10-labeled cross-linked peptide (m/z 624.67463+) also generated the same
type of MS2 fragment ion (αA*+T*, m/z 618.673+) (Supplementary Figure 4B
in the Supporting Information), corroborating
well with the predicted fragmentation unique to intralinked peptides.
As for dead-end modified peptides, they are expected to generate two
distinct MS2 fragment ions (Figure 2C). Such
characteristic fragmentation was observed for DMDSSO dead-end peptides
as demonstrated by MS2 spectra of a selected pair of d0- (m/z 546.61163+) and d10-dead-end (m/z 549.96613+) modified cytochrome C
peptides, in which a pair of fragment ions αA/αT and αA*/αT* were detected,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 4C,D in the Supporting Information). Taken together, the results further
demonstrate that DMDSSO cross-linked peptides indeed produce specific
MS2 fragmentation patterns that are predictable and reliable for the
determination of their cross-link types, which allows subsequent MS3
analysis of unique MS2 fragments for unambiguous identification of
cross-linked peptides. These features are consistent with those of
DSSO cross-linked peptides,12 further attesting
the power and general applicability of sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable
cross-linkers in XL-MS studies.

Detection of d0/d10-DMDSSO Cross-Linked
Peptide Pairs
In order
to further facilitate the detection and identification of cross-linked
peptides, we next mixed the digests of d0- and d10-DMDSSO cross-linked cytochrome
C at 1:1 for LC–MSn analysis. When
analyzed together, d0- and d10-DMDSSO cross-linked peptides should be detected as
isotopic doublets in MS1 with defined mass differences (Δ(d10 – d0)
= n × 10 Da) depending on the number of cross-links
(n) in a given cross-linked peptide. In contrast,
noncross-linked peptides should be detected only as singlets. This
provides additional confirmation to cross-linked peptides identified
by MSn. Not surprisingly, all of the cross-linked
peptides identified display the expected isotopic doublets with a
10 Da mass difference, indicative of cross-linked peptides containing
one cross-link. This can be exemplified by respective peptide pairs
detected in MS1 for the three representative DMDSSO cross-linked cytochrome
C peptides described above (Supplementary Figure 5A–C in the Supporting Information). Similar isotopic signatures
can also be detected in MS2 if d0- and d10-DMDSSO cross-linked peptide pairs can be
selected for CID analysis at the same time or their respective MS2
spectra can be merged together. The resulting MS2 isotopic doublets
would have a mass difference of 5 Da because MS2 fragments of DMDSSO
cross-linked peptides only carry five residual isotopic labels (Figure 2E). Similarly, the unique MS2 isotopic signature
can be used to facilitate the identification and quantitation of cross-linked
peptides; however, special software is needed for effective data analysis.
Although quantitation at the MS1 level is often preferred due to sensitivity,
the detection of multiple MS2 isotopic pairs can provide better statistics
in quantitation.

In total, 33 unique interlinked cytochrome
C peptides were identified, and 19 of them were identified based on
MSn analysis of both d0- and d10-DMDSSO-cross-linked
peptides (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 7 in the Supporting Information). The remaining 14 interlinks
were determined only by MSn sequencing
of either d0- or d10-DMDSSO-cross-linked peptides. Importantly, the detection
of d0/d10 peptide
doublets confirms the existence of the same cross-linked peptides
formed by both cross-linkers even if only one of the d0 and d10 forms is analyzed
by MSn. These results demonstrate that
isotope-coded cross-linkers further improve the identification of
cross-linked peptides. The 33 identified interlinked peptides represent
26 unique K–K linkages in cytochrome C, Cα–Cα distances of which range from 5.3 to
26.2 Å based on the reported monomer crystal structure (PDB 2B4Z). These distances
are well within the expected range of our cross-linkers (≤26
Å). However, it is noted that some of the identified cross-linked
peptides more likely represent interprotein interlinks and may have
larger spatial distances as the dimerized cytochrome C was analyzed
here. For example, the peptide [39KTGQAPGFSYTDANK53] was determined to be interlinked with another peptide [39KTGQAPGFSYTDANKNK55] through K39 to
K53 linkage (Supplementary Table 1 in the Supporting
Information). Interestingly, these two interlinked peptides
share a significant overlap in sequences, strongly suggesting an interprotein
interlink between a cytochrome C dimer.

Previously, we have
identified 14 interlinked cytochrome C peptides
using DSSO cross-linking,12 8 of which
have also been determined by d0/d10-DMDSSO cross-linking in this study. Although
each study has resulted in several unique cross-linked peptides, it
is noted that many of the identified interlinked lysines are located
in very close proximity within the sequence of cytochrome C. For example,
while K53 to K79 (11.6 Å) linkage was found with DSSO cross-linking,
K55 to K73 (11.6 Å) was only identified by DMDSSO cross-linking.
Because of the similar calculated distances within these cross-linked
lysine residues and the closeness of K53 to K55 as well as the proximity
between K73 and K79, we consider their interaction regions are similar.
Therefore, we clustered 17 lysines of cytochrome C into 8 “groups”,
in which adjacent lysines are within a string of 6 amino acids (Supplementary
Figure 6 in the Supporting Information).
In comparison to the interlinks identified within these lysine groups,
this work has mapped all of the interlinked regions determined by
DSSO cross-linking.12 In addition, 5 additional
ones derived from 10 DMDSSO cross-linked peptides were identified,
representing the most extensive cross-linking data on cytochrome C.
These results are more likely attributed to combined improvements
in sample preparation, data acquisition, and usage of two isotope-coded
cross-linkers separately and simultaneously.

In contrast to
previous analysis of the entire cross-linked cytochrome
C mixture in which the monomeric form was the most abundant species,12 here we have only focused on analyzing gel-separated
cytochrome C dimer bands to decrease sample complexity. Because most
noncross-linked tryptic peptides, dead-end modified, and intralinked
cross-linked peptides have lower charges than interlinked peptides,
we also modified data acquisition control to select only higher charged
ions (i.e., 3+ and up) for MSn analysis.
This allows the instrument to carry out data-dependent MSn acquisition toward potentially interlinked peptides.
Importantly, the concurrent usage of the isotope-labeled cross-linkers
permits easy detection of cross-linked peptides and increases the
identification of interlinked peptides overall. Taken together, our
current workflow has proven its effectiveness in identifying cross-linked
peptides.

Quantitation of d0/d10 Labeled Cross-Linked Peptides
In addition
to assisting MS detection and identification of cross-linked peptides,
we expect that isotope-coded cross-linkers can be used to study protein
structural changes by quantifying relative abundances of nonlabeled
and labeled cross-linked peptides. In order to do this, protein cross-linking
has to be carried out using nonlabeled and labeled cross-linkers separately
assuming their cross-linking efficiencies are similar. In our experiments,
we have shown that cross-linking efficiency of cytochrome C by d0- or d10-DMDSSO
is very similar (Supplementary Figure 3 in the Supporting Information) and equal mixing of the peptide digests
of d0- and d10 cross-linked cytochrome C led to DMDSSO cross-linked peptide doublets
with relative ratios of 1 (Supplementary Figure 5A–C in the Supporting Information). Since previous XL-MS
studies often cross-link proteins using a 1:1 mixture of nonlabeled
and labeled cross-linkers to generate isotopic pairs, we wanted to
compare whether equivalent results can be achieved using different
sample preparation approaches. Therefore, we first cross-linked cytochrome
C with a 1:1 mixture of d0- and d10-DMDSSO and then analyzed the resulting cross-linked
peptide digests by MS (Supplementary Figure 5D–F in the Supporting Information). In comparison, corresponding d0- and d10-labeled
cross-linked peptides display similar relative abundance ratios regardless
of whether mixing was done before or after protein cross-linking.
These results suggest that our isotopically labeled cross-linkers
are indeed comparable in their ability to cross-link proteins and
that the resulting d0- and d10-labeled cross-linked products behave similarly during
sample preparation and MSn analysis, thus
providing flexibility of using these isotope-coded reagents in XL-MS
studies.

To further explore the capability of d0- and d10-DMDSSO for quantitative
analysis, we cross-linked cytochrome C with d0- and d10-DMDSSO separately, carried
out their in-gel digestion, and then mixed the resulting peptide digests
in five chosen d0/d10 ratios (i.e., 5:1, 2:1, 1:1; 1:2, 1:5) prior to LC–MSn analysis. In order to determine the relative
abundance ratios, we manually obtained extracted ion chromatograms
(XIC) for five selected d0- and d10-labeled cross-linked peptide pairs for each
sample. As an example, Figure 6A–E illustrates
the overlay of XICs for a representative d0- and d10-DMDSSO interlinked peptide
pair in five samples mixed with different ratios, and the corresponding
MS spectra are shown in Figure 6F–J.
On the basis of the calculated area under XICs, its relative abundance
(d0/d10) was
determined as 4.79, 2.08, 0.99, 0.43, and 0.20, respectively, which
correlates well with the initial sample mixing. In addition, the ratios
obtained from peptide peak intensity are similar to those obtained
using XIC, indicating that both approaches are sufficient for calculating
relative abundance of cross-linked peptides. As shown in Figure 6K, the average ratios of the five selected cross-linked
peptides for each sample corroborate very well with initial sample
mixing. Collectively, these results have demonstrated the capability
of quantifying cross-linked peptides using isotope-coded DMDSSO reagents.

Conclusions
We report here the development
and characterization of new DSSO
derivatives, a pair of isotope-coded MS-cleavable cross-linkers: d0- and d10-DMDSSO.
DMDSSO cross-linked peptides preserve the same characteristic MS2
fragmentation patterns distinctive to cross-link types as DSSO cross-linked
peptides, thus facilitating the detection and identification of cross-linked
peptides. In combination with MS3 sequencing, MS1 mass mapping and
isotopic profiling, the nature and identity of cross-linked peptides
can be determined readily and unambiguously. This work further demonstrates
the robustness of sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linkers
in XL-MS studies and provides a strong basis for us to further develop
new DSSO derivatives and fully define protein–protein interactions.
In addition, we have shown the flexibility in using d0- and d10-DMDSSO for quantitative
analysis of cross-linked peptides, thus establishing a solid foundation
for our future studies toward the understanding of structural dynamics
of protein complexes.
