Solubility
is a physicochemical property highly dependent on the
solid-state form of a compound. Thus, alteration of a compound’s
solid-state form can be undertaken to enhance the solubility of poorly
soluble drug compounds. In the Biopharmaceutics Classification System
(BCS), drugs are classified on the basis of their aqueous solubility
and permeability. However, aqueous solubility does not always correlate
best with in vivo solubility and consequently bioavailability. Therefore,
the use of biorelevant media is a more suitable approach for mimicking
in vivo conditions. Here, assessed with a novel image-based single-particle-analysis
(SPA) method, we report a constant ratio of solubility increase of
3.3 ± 0.5 between the α and γ solid-state forms of
indomethacin in biorelevant media. The ratio was independent of pH,
ionic strength, and surfactant concentration, which all change as
the drug passes through the gastrointestinal tract. On the basis of
the solubility ratio, a free-energy difference between the two polymorphic
forms of 2.9 kJ/mol was estimated. Lastly, the use of the SPA approach
to assess solubility has proven to be simple, fast, and both solvent-
and sample-sparing, making it an attractive tool for drug development.

==== Body
The effect
of a drug in the
body is a consequence of an intriguing interplay on the molecular
level, with potency and selectivity being two values we use to characterize
it. These two parameters, as crucial as they might seem, are not vital
in determining the developability of a drug: stability and solubility
are.1−3 Furthermore, solubility is not only a molecular property; it is
also highly governed by a compound’s solid-state form.2,4

The rise of a new solid-state form in drug development can
cause
serious complications. Norvir is an illustrative example; two years
after the product was launched, ritonavir, the active ingredient,
transformed from Form I into a more thermodynamically stable Form
II.5 The new polymorph exhibited significantly
reduced solubility resulting in lower bioavailability. Therefore,
for a compound entering the development stage, it is wise to have
a well-established polymorphic map with the corresponding thermodynamic
relationships. Thermodynamic relationships are usually approached
through the means of thermal analysis but can also be estimated from
solubility data.6,7 The obtained knowledge may thereafter
be used for the deliberate alteration of a compound’s solid-state
form as an option to enhance its druglike properties (i.e., solubility).8,9 This is especially true in these times of high-throughput screening
(HTS) and combinatorial chemistry, when poor aqueous solubility is
becoming a major issue in the drug-development process.3,4

In its most basic definition, thermodynamic-equilibrium solubility
refers to the maximum amount of the most stable crystalline form of
the compound that can remain dissolved in a given volume of the solvent
at a given temperature and pressure.8,10,11 The solubility of higher-energy solid-state forms
(i.e., amorphous and metastable polymorphic forms) is referred to
as “apparent solubility”.9,12 Therefore,
starting the solubility measurement with a higher-energy solid-state
form will initially produce the apparent solubility, but given enough
time, the thermodynamic-equilibrium solubility of the most stable
form will eventually dominate.

On the basis of aqueous solubility
and permeability over a pH range
of 1–7.5, drugs are categorized using the Biopharmaceutics
Classification System (BCS).13 Over the
time the BCS has been in use, it has become apparent that further
refinements are required, especially with regard to the in vivo correlation
between dissolution and solubility.14 Bergström
et al. showed that the apparent BCS classification of some compounds
could shift when dissolved in biorelevant media.15

Biorelevant media simulate gastric or intestinal
fluid in a fed
or fasted state by containing various additives.16,17 The most important with respect to drug dissolution are the surfactants
(i.e., lecithin and sodium taurocholate). These amphiphilic molecules
arrange themselves onto the solid–liquid interface and modify
the wetting behavior by reduction of the contact angle between the
drug and the liquid. Moreover, if the critical micellar concentration
is exceeded, the drug molecules can become incorporated inside the
self-assembled surfactant structures (micelles).18 Finally, in addition to the solubility, surfactants can
also affect the polymorphic changes of a dissolving compound, as shown
by Lehto and co-workers.19

The aim
of the present study was to investigate the solubility
of polymorphs of indomethacin, a BCS class II drug, in biorelevant
media. Solubility measurements were conducted utilizing the newly
developed image-based single-particle-analysis (SPA) method.20 The method combines optics with fluidics and
enables measurement of solubility with less than 0.1 mg of a compound
on the basis of the dissolution rate. With the SPA method, the impact
of the dissolution media and the effect of the solid-state form on
solubility were studied. Moreover, an estimation of the free-energy
difference between the two polymorphic forms was made.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Indomethacin (γ form) was acquired
from Orion Pharma (Espoo, Finland). Hydrochloric acid (98%), acetic
acid (≥99.85%), phosphorus pentoxide, and sodium chloride were
acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). FaSSIF/FeSSIF/FaSSGF
biorelevant powder was acquired from Biorelevant (London, U.K.).

Preparation of α and γ Forms
The γ
form of indomethacin was used without further purification or processing.
The α form of indomethacin was prepared by dissolving γ
indomethacin powder in a 50% (v/v) EtOH/Milli-Q water mixture, followed
by slow evaporation of the solvent, which is a modification of the
method used by Kaneniwa et al.21 The obtained
crystals were collected and stored over phosphorus pentoxide at ambient
temperature.

Dissolution Media
Three kinds of
media of pH 1.6 (i.e.,
HCl; fasted-state simulated gastric fluid, FaSSGF; and blank FaSSGF,
FaSSGFblk) were prepared according to the instructions
of the manufacturer (Biorelevant, London, U.K.). Furthermore, two
kinds of media of pH 5.0 were prepared: fed-state simulated intestinal
fluid (FeSSIF) and blank FeSSIF (FeSSIFblk). FaSSGF and
FeSSIF biorelevant media were selected to represent a physiological
environment with surfactant molecules present below and above the
critical micellar concentration, respectively. The detailed compositions
of the media are listed in Table 1.

Image-Based Solubility Measurements
Dissolution experiments
utilizing the SPA method were performed using a custom-made flow-through
setup (Figure 1). The
experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C) rather
than at 37 °C in order to ensure controlled experimental conditions.
The setup enables the trapping of particles under constant-flow conditions.
In this way, dissolved molecules are continuously extracted from the
chamber, and sink conditions are maintained. As the measurement can
be started as soon as the solvent comes in contact with the entrapped
particles, the actual solubility of a metastable form can be measured
before any possible solid-state transformation occurs that could affect
the solubility.

Figure 1 Scheme of the flow-through device (not to scale). Blue
arrows present
the flow of the solvent. Particles of the compound being analyzed
are immobilized in the flow-through chamber. Light access is enabled
through the window on the bottom, and imaging of the particles is
enabled through the glass window on the top.

In eq 1, at
sink conditions,
bulk concentration (Cb) can be disregarded
because it is practically zero. This means the dissolution rate (dm/dt) is dependent only on the equilibrium
solubility at the interface (CS); k is the setup-dependent transport-rate constant determined
as described by Svanbäck.20 1  

For a single measurement, approximately 10 mL of dissolution
medium
and less than 0.1 mg of sample were used. Online images were acquired
over 15 min through the transparent part of the flow-through chamber
using a USB microscope (Gigastone S1-100, Irvine, CA). At least five
particles per solid-state form per medium were measured. For the analysis
of the image data, a MatLab script was previously developed by Svanbäck
and co-workers.20,22 The script enables quantification
of the particle’s morphology change (i.e., dissolution rate)
and, consequently, calculation of the solubility according to eq 1.

Shake-Flask Solubility
Measurements
The solubilities
of α and γ indomethacin were measured by the conventional
shake-flask method in HCl (pH 1.6), FaSSGFblk, and FeSSIFblk. A detailed description of the methodology can be found
in the Supporting Information on page S-2.

X-ray-Powder Diffraction (XRPD)
XRPD diffractograms
were recorded using an Empyrean diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical
B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54 Å) and a divergence slit of 1/8°. Samples were packed
into the aluminum holder and measured at 45 kV and 40 mA from 5 to
35° (2θ) with a step size of 0.0066°.

Differential-Scanning
Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC experiments
were performed using a DSC823e (Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland)
equipped with a refrigerated cooling system (Julabo FT 900, Seelbach,
Germany). Nitrogen was used as a purge gas (50 mL/min).

Samples
(2–5 mg) were tightly packed into standard aluminum crucibles
(40 μL) with pierced lids. Two different procedures were used
in these measurements. For determination of melting temperature and
enthalpy, the samples were equilibrated at 25 °C for 3 min and
then linearly heated with a heating rate of 10 °C/min to 180
°C. For determination of heat capacities, the samples were equilibrated
at 140 °C and then heated up to 180 °C using a TOPEM-modulated
heating program with a heating rate of 1 °C/min and a pulse height
of 1 °C. Samples were measured in triplicate, and thermal events
were analyzed using STARe software (Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland).
Temperatures of melting, enthalpies of melting, and heat capacities
were used to estimate the free-energy difference between the α
and γ polymorphs.

Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Time-Resolved
Raman Spectroscopy
FT-IR measurements were conducted using
a Burker Vertex 70 spectrometer
(Burker Optik, Ettlingen, Germany). The spectrometer was coupled with
an attenuated-total-reflectance (ATR) accessory, a single-reflection
diamond crystal (MIRacle, Pike Technologies, Madison, WI). The final
spectrum was the mean of 128 scans with a resolution of 2 cm–1 and a spectral range from 650 to 4000 cm–1. The
absorbance spectra were obtained using OPUS software (v. 5.0, Burker
Optik, Ettlingen, Germany).

The time-resolved Raman measurements
were performed using a TG532 M1 Raman Spectrometer System (TimeGate
Instruments, Oulu, Finland). The average power used was 60 mW, the
pulse width was 150 ps, the spot size was 85 μm, and the repetition
rate was 40 kHz. Samples were packed in an aluminum holder and measured.
During the measurements, the focal point was moved continuously using
a SampleCube provided by TimeGate Instruments (Oulu, Finland). The
spectral range was recorded at 11 consecutive detector positions from
900 to 1800 cm–1. The data was processed using a
MatLab-based program provided by TimeGate Instruments (Oulu, Finland).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Samples were placed on
a sample holder using double-sided carbon adhesive tape. Upon adhesion,
samples were coated with platinum in a high-vacuum evaporator (Q150TS,
Quorum Technologies, Lewes, U.K.) and imaged with a Quanta 250 FEG
SEM (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). Images were taken with 500×
magnification.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the
Solid-State Forms
Results of
the solid-state characterization are presented in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2. Spectroscopic and
thermal analyses of the samples were in good agreement with previously
reported data on the thermodynamically metastable α and stable
γ solid-state forms of indomethacin.23−26 Moreover, experimental XRPD diffractograms
of the α and γ forms coincide with those reported in the
Cambridge Structural Database (INDMET02 and INDMET01, respectively).

The benzoyl-stretching mode,
listed in Table 2,
represents the difference in H-bonding
in the α and γ crystals. The two stretching modes of the
C=O groups, H-bonded and non-H-bonded, are present in α
crystals, and only one stretching mode, non-H-bonded, is present in
γ crystals.26 The difference in H-bonding
is associated with different orientations of the molecules in the
crystalline lattice. This difference on the molecular scale is translated
to the macroscopically distinct shapes of α and γ crystals.
In Figure 3, needle-shaped
α crystals can be clearly distinguished from prismatic γ
crystals.

SPA-Method Solubility Measurements: Impact of the Solid-State
Form
Using the image-based SPA method, the solubilities of
the α and γ solid-state forms of indomethacin in selected
media were measured (Figure 4). In the time span of the measurements, there were constant
increases in dissolved mass for both solid-state forms. Hence, it
was concluded that no solid-state change took place that would affect
the solubility of the dissolving form. Moreover, no effect of particle
morphology on the SPA solubility values was found (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Therefore, the apparent
equilibrium solubility of the α form and the thermodynamic-equilibrium
solubility of the γ form were measured. Additionally, the solubilities
of α and γ indomethacin were also measured by the conventional
shake-flask method (Supplementary Table S1 and Figures S3 and S4).

solid-state forms
in media with pH 1.6 (a) and media with pH 5.0 (b) as measured with
the SPA method. The effects of pH and surfactants (FaSSGF and FeSSIF)
on solubility can be noted. FaSSGF: fasted-state simulated gastric
fluid, FeSSIF: fed-state simulated intestinal fluid, FaSSGFblk: blank FaSSGF, FeSSIFblk: blank FeSSIF.

The ratio of α- to γ-solid-state-form
solubility was
constant at 3.3 ± 0.5 in all of the studied media. The observed
ratio was higher than the value of 1.7 ± 0.4 obtained by the
shake-flask experiment in this study (Supporting Information, page S-2). Moreover, the ratio was also higher
than the 1.1 value obtained by Hancock et al., where the α-
to γ-solubility ratio was measured in 200 mL of deionized water
at 45 °C using a flat-bottomed, water-jacketed, glass vessel
with a propeller stirrer.9 Their samples
were withdrawn at regular intervals through a 0.22 μm filter
and diluted with a standard solution of indomethacin in 50:50 methanol/water,
and the concentration was measured by UV–visible spectrometry.
Both procedures, the shake-flask experiment conducted in this study
and the one performed by Hancock et al., have several more steps when
compared with the straightforward SPA method. Nevertheless, Hancock
et al. also found that the reported solubility ratio of crystalline
polymorphs varies between 1.1 and 4.0, which is in agreement with
the α- to γ-solubility ratio observed in this study.

The constant solubility ratio in HCl, FaSSGFblk, FaSSGF,
FeSSIFblk, and FeSSIF media indicates that changes in the
ionic strength, pH, or surfactant concentration of the medium affect
the solubility of both indomethacin crystalline solid-state forms
to the same extent.

SPA-Method Solubility Measurements: Impact
of the Dissolution
Media
To evaluate the impact of the dissolution media, ratios
of the average solubility values (RS)
of the same indomethacin solid-state form measured in different media
were calculated (eq 2). Sx and Sy are the average solubility values in media x and y. It must be noted
that the standard deviation of the calculated ratios is relatively
large and most likely results from the particulate nature of the SPA
measurement, discussed in more detail in the Particle
Statistics section. 2  

The composition of the dissolution
media affects the solubility of indomethacin. At pH 1.6, an increase
in the ionic strength of the dissolution medium (from HCl to FaSSGFblk) resulted in decreases in the solubilities of both solid-state
forms (Table 3). On
the other hand, the addition of surfactants (from FaSSGFblk to FaSSGF) resulted in 2.1 and 2.5 times higher solubilities of
the α and γ forms. Consequently, increases in both the
ionic strength of the dissolution medium and the surfactant concentration
(from HCl to FaSSGF) cancel each other out and do not have a significant
impact on solubility.

In FeSSIF,
the concentrations of sodium taurocholate and lecithin
were above their respective critical micellar concentrations (CMC).27,28 Therefore, surfactant molecules were arranged in micelles, spherical
structures in which the hydrophilic regions (heads) are in contact
with the solvent, and the hydrophobic regions (chains) are contained
within the micelle center. In FaSSGF, the concentrations of sodium
taurocholate and lecithin are below the CMC. Thus, micelles were not
formed. The occurrence of micelles in dissolution media (from FeSSIFblk to FeSSIF) resulted in 5.6- and 4.0-fold increases of the
α- and γ-form solubilities, respectively. A similar increase
(7.3-fold) in the solubility of the γ form at 37 °C using
a μDISS profiler was also measured by Fagerberg and co-workers.15 From a physicochemical perspective, the solubility
was increased because of the two following phenomena: lowering of
the solvent’s surface tension (in both FeSSIF and FaSSGF) and
distribution of hydrophobic indomethacin molecules inside the micelles
(only in FeSSIF).

Particle Statistics
Because of the
large relative standard
deviations (RSD) of the collected data (55 ± 15%), the Mann–Whitney
test was used to determine if the measured particles of the α
and γ forms belong to two separate populations. The results
(Table 4) show that
there is a significant difference in the solubility values of the
α and γ forms in all of the five media used. Therefore,
despite the relatively large RSDs between the solubilities of individual
particles measured with the image-based SPA method, the samples were
still distinct enough to show that they belong to different populations
and therefore different solid-state forms of indomethacin.

One of the reasons
for the high RSD values can be the SPA method
itself, which is still in the development process. With further improvements
in the experimental setup, control of experimental conditions, and
image quality, the RSD may be reduced. Nevertheless, one should consider
another aspect of this phenomenon. At its core, the SPA method measures
the solubility of individual particles, and the solubility of the
compound is the average of the solubility values of all the single
particles measured.

In principle, the equilibrium solubility
in the shake-flask method
is reached after an equilibration period of up to several days, during
which a compound is transformed into its most thermodynamically stable
form with the lowest solubility.29 With
the image-based SPA method, even the equilibrium solubility of the
thermodynamically stable γ solid-state form was approached in
a dynamic manner in a matter of minutes, without any equilibration
period.

Even if the compound is in its most stable solid-state
form, the
surface energy of individual particles is not unity, but it most likely
follows the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.30 Therefore, a single solid-state form presents a population
of particles, of which each has a slightly different surface energy.
To our knowledge, this could also contribute to the high variation
of the solubility data collected with the SPA method compared with
that of the shake-flask method, where this particle-to-particle energy
difference is already averaged out by using several milligrams of
a compound and thus a multitude of particles.31 It should also be noted that the uncertainty of solubility values
reported in the literature is in the range of 0.6 log units.32 In contrast, the uncertainty of the SPA measurements
was 0.26 log units.

Estimation of the Free-Energy Difference
between Polymorphs
The free-energy difference between two
polymorphs can be estimated
from their melting data or their respective solubility values. For
the former, according to Yu et al.,6 to
estimate the difference in enthalpy (ΔHm) and entropy (ΔSm) of the
melting process, eqs 3 and 4, respectively, can be used under two
conditions: (a) the difference between the melting points of the polymorphs
is less than 20 K (it is 6.3 K for α and γ indomethacin)
and (b) (Cp,L – Cp,γ) is assumed to be constant. 3   4  

In eqs 3 and 4, ΔHm,x is the melting-enthalpy change, and Tm,x is the melting temperature of the respective polymorphic
form. Cp,L and Cp,γ are the heat capacities of the supercooled liquid
state and γ form, respectively. By combining eqs 3 and 4 with
the well-established relation ΔG0 = ΔH – TΔS, we obtain eq 5, where ΔG0 is the free-energy
difference at Tm,α. 5  

To extrapolate the ΔG to room temperature,
a correction for nonlinearity has to be made if (Cp,γ – Cp,α) ≠ 0, as is the case with α and γ indomethacin
polymorphs (Table 2). In this place, eq 6, also derived by Yu et al.,6 can be used,
where (Cp,γ – Cp,α)0 is the value of (Cp,γ – Cp,α) at Tm,α. A reasonable estimate
of this value can be made by subtracting the heat-capacity changes
upon melting, (Cp,L – Cp,α) and (Cp,L – Cp,γ). 6  

The estimated ΔG between the α and
γ polymorphs amounts to 12 ± 7 J/g. The high standard error
of the results represents the imprecision of the above free-energy-difference
estimation, which originates from an attempt to precisely measure
a small energy difference of a process with high energy content: melting.

On the other hand, the ΔG between the polymorphs
is directly proportional to their solubilities.7 Therefore, the estimation of the free-energy difference
can also be obtained using eq 7, with R, T, and Sx being the gas constant, the ambient temperature,
and the solubilities of the polymorphs, respectively. Inserting the
α- to γ-solubility ratio obtained with the SPA method
into eq 7, a value of
8 ± 1 J/g is obtained. The result is more precise, and it fits
in the range of 12 ± 7 J/g. 7  

The metastable α polymorph has a higher
energy content than
the stable γ polymorph, and the difference exceeds randomizing
thermal energy. The thermal energy (ET) of a system at room temperature
is calculated as ET = R × T22°C = 2.45 kJ/mol. The magnitude of ET can be used
as a rough indicator of the interaction strength between molecules.30 This means that if the interaction energy or,
in our case, the difference in free energy, ΔG, exceeds ET, it will overcome the opposing disorganizing effect
of thermal motion. The calculated ΔG from the
solubility ratios of the α and γ polymorphs expressed
in molar units amounts to 2.9 kJ/mol, whereas the shake-flask solubility
ratios give a value of 1.3 kJ/mol. It is well-known that the α
form of indomethacin is stable at room temperature, which would substantiate
the result obtained by the theoretical estimation based on DSC measurements
and the SPA method.

Conclusions
In this study, the SPA
method was proven capable of determining
the solubility of two different solid-state forms of the same drug
compound. The solubility ratio of the α to γ solid-state
forms of indomethacin is constant at 3.3 ± 0.5 and is not affected
by pH, ionic-strength, or surfactant-concentration changes below or
above CMC. Therefore, the only factor affecting the solubility ratio
is the ΔG (2.9 kJ/mol) between the two polymorphs.

The use of biorelevant media resulted in significantly higher solubility
values when compared with the respective values in aqueous blank media.
This indicates that for a solubility study aiming to estimate solubility,
bioavailability, or BCS classification, biorelevant dissolution media
should be used over blank aqueous buffers.

Finally, the SPA
method can be characterized as a quick-turnover
and low-solvent- and low-substance-consumption method, thus making
it a highly appealing research tool when it comes to polymorph-solubility
screening.
