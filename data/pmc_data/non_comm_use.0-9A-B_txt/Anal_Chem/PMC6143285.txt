Fecal volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) are increasingly considered
to be potential noninvasive, diagnostic biomarkers for various gastrointestinal
diseases. Knowledge of the influence of sampling conditions on VOC
outcomes is limited. We aimed to evaluate the effects of sampling
conditions on fecal VOC profiles and to assess under which conditions
an optimal diagnostic accuracy in the discrimination between pediatric
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and controls could be obtained. Fecal
samples from de novo treatment-naïve pediatric IBD patients
and healthy controls (HC) were used to assess the effects of sampling
conditions compared to the standard operating procedure (reference
standard), defined as 500 mg of sample mass diluted with 10 mL tap
water, using field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS). A
total of 17 IBD (15 CD (Crohn's disease) and 2 UC (ulcerative
colitis))
and 25 HC were included. IBD and HC could be discriminated with high
accuracy (accuracy = 0.93, AUC = 0.99, p < 0.0001).
A smaller fecal sample mass resulted in a decreased diagnostic accuracy
(300 mg accuracy = 0.77, AUC = 0.69, p = 0.02; 100
mg accuracy = 0.70, AUC = 0.74, p = 0.003). A loss
of diagnostic accuracy was seen toward increased numbers of thaw–freeze
cycles (one cycle, accuracy = 0.61, AUC = 0.80, p = 0.0004; two cycles, accuracy = 0.64, AUC = 0.56, p = 0.753; and three cycles, accuracy = 0.57, AUC = 0.50, p = 0.5101) and when samples were kept at room temperature
for 180 min prior to analysis (accuracy = 0.60, AUC = 0.51, p = 0.46). Diagnostic accuracy of VOC profiles was not significantly
influenced by storage duration differences of 20 months. The application
of a 500 mg sample mass analyzed after one thaw–freeze cycle
showed the best discriminative accuracy for the differentiation of
IBD and HC. VOC profiles and diagnostic accuracy were significantly
affected by sampling conditions, underlining the need for the implementation
of standardized protocols in fecal VOC analysis.

==== Body
The analysis of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) is a relatively new technique within the field of
metabolomics. VOCs are carbon-based chemicals originating from both
physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human body.
Fecal VOCs are considered to reflect microbiota composition, function,
and interaction with the host.1,2 They are increasingly
considered to have potential as a biomarker in the diagnostic workup
and monitoring of various gastrointestinal diseases, e.g., inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and even sepsis.3−11 Various studies have demonstrated the diagnostic potential of VOCs
in both pediatric and adult IBD populations by analyzing VOCs deriving
from urine, exhaled breath, and feces.6,12−14 The majority of studies on fecal VOCs has been performed using gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), allowing for the identification
of individual VOCs on a molecular level. This technique is expensive,
time consuming, and requires specialized personnel and is therefore
not suitable for utilization in a clinical setting.15 Pattern-recognition-based techniques, such as electronic
noses (eNose) and field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS),
are examples of instruments that are less expensive and faster, allowing
for their application as a noninvasive biomarker in a clinical practice.
However, traditional eNoses contain sensors that are notorious for
batch-to-batch variation, fouling and aging effects, and sensor drifts.14,16 The novel measurement of VOCs using physical techniques, coupled
with pattern recognition, like FAIMS, have a higher sensitivity and
minimal drift. It achieves separation by measuring the differences
in the mobility of ionized molecules in high-electric fields.

Data on the potential influence of sampling and storage methods
on fecal VOC profiles are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the effects
of environmental factors and sampling conditions on fecal VOC profiles
using FAIMS. In addition, we aimed to assess under which conditions
an optimal diagnostic accuracy could be obtained in the differentiation
between pediatric IBD and controls. This may lead to the development
of rationale-based standardization protocols on fecal VOC analysis,
paving the way toward reliable comparisons between different study
outcomes and the implementation of VOC-based diagnostics in clinical
practice.

Methods
Study Design
This case-control study
was performed
at the outpatient clinic of the pediatric gastroenterology departments
in two tertiary referral hospitals, the VU University Medical Center
(VUmc) and the Emma Children’s Hospital, Academic Medical Center
(AMC), both located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Study Participants
Inflammatory
Bowel Disease
IBD subjects were selected
from an existing cohort of de novo treatment-naïve pediatric
patients, consisting of 125 subjects (78 CD (Crohn’s disease),
47 UC (ulcerative colitis), aged 4 to 17 years, recruited between
October 2013 and July 2017 at the VU University Medical Center (VUmc)
and Academic Medical Center (AMC). The diagnosis of IBD was based
on endoscopic, histologic, and radiologic findings, according to the
revised Porto criteria.17 The localization
and behavior of IBD were classified during endoscopy, based on the
Paris classification.18 Physician global
assessment (PGA) combined with levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)
and fecal calprotectin (FCP) was used as an index of the clinical
disease activity.19,20 All IBD patients were asked to
collect a fecal sample prior to endoscopy and bowel preparation.14 The inclusion criteria also included sufficient
fecal material for VOC analysis (3.4 g per subject). Exclusion criteria
were the use of antibiotics, probiotics, or immunosuppressive therapy
in the three months prior to inclusion, a concomitant diagnosis of
a gastrointestinal disease or immunocompromised disease (i.e., HIV,
leukemia), and abdominal surgery (except for appendectomy). In addition,
children with proven infectious colitis (parasites in stools or positive
stool culture for Salmonella spp., Shigella
spp., Yersinia spp., Campylobacter
spp., or toxigenic Clostridium spp.) were
excluded.

Healthy Controls
Healthy controls
(HC) were children
4 to 17 years old selected from elementary and high schools in North-Holland,
The Netherlands between June 2016 and December 2016. All participants
were asked to collect a fecal sample and complete a questionnaire
on abdominal symptoms, bowel habits, including the consistency of
their stool using the Bristol stool chart, medication use, and medical
history.21 Exclusion criteria for HC were
similar to IBD, with the addition of the diagnosis of IBD and/or a
functional gastrointestinal disorder according to the Rome IV criteria
based on the questionnaires.

Matching Procedure
From the original cohort of 125
IBD patients, 106 were not eligible for this study due to insufficient
quantities of the fecal samples. A total of 17 IBD patients (15CD,
2UC) could be matched on age at sample collection and gender with
25 participants in the HC group.

Ethical Considerations
This study was approved by the
medical ethical review committee (METc) of the VU University Medical
Center (VUmc) under file number 2016.393 and by the local medical
ethical committee of the Emma Children’s Hospital (AMC). Written
informed consent was obtained from all parents and from the children
when over the age of 12.

Sample Collection IBD and Controls
All study participants
collected fresh fecal samples in a stool container (Stuhlgefäß
10 mL, Frickenhausen, Germany). Patients with IBD collected their
fecal sample prior to endoscopy and bowel lavage. Participants were
instructed to store the fecal samples in the freezer at home directly
after collection. The samples were transported to the hospital in
cooled condition, using cooling elements or ice cubes. Directly upon
their arrival in the hospital, the samples were stored in the freezer
(−24 °C) until analysis.

Sample Preparation IBD
and Controls
The influence of
fecal sample mass, number of thaw–freeze cycles, and duration
of storage at room temperature were assessed by comparing the VOC
profiles derived from the subsamples taken from the original fecal
sample of each HC and IBD subject. The subsamples were weighed on
a calibrated scale (Mettler Toledo, AT 261 Delta Range, Ohio, United
States), labeled, and returned to a −24 °C freezer until
further handling. We compared the variables of interest with our standard
operating procedure (reference standard), defined as a mixture of
500 mg of feces diluted with 10 mL of tap water and kept at room temperature
for 10 min prior to analysis. These reference standard settings were
chosen since they were used in several previous studies on fecal VOC
profiling in a range of gastroenterology diseases and have provided
us with positive results.14,22

Variables of Interest
The effect of fecal sample mass
on the diagnostic accuracy of fecal VOC profiles was assessed by comparing
subsamples weighing 100 mg and 300 mg with the reference standard
mass of 500 mg.

The influence of the number of thaw–freeze
cycles on the diagnostic accuracy was analyzed by comparing the reference
standard to subsamples, which underwent one, two, and three additional
thaw–freeze cycles. For every additional cycle, the sample
was kept at room temperature for 10 min and subsequently kept on dry
ice until the sample was frozen.

In order to assess the effect
of the duration of storage at room
temperature on the diagnostic accuracy, VOC from samples kept at room
temperature (18 °C) for 180 min were compared to the reference
standard. Variables of interest are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Variables

As described above, the effect of every variable on
the diagnostic
accuracy of fecal VOCs were assessed by comparing IBD subjects with
HC. In addition, we assessed the influence of the variables on the
VOC pattern. By combining the HC and IBD subjects, we were able to
compare the variables to the reference standard.

FAIMS Analysis
For this study a commercially available
FAIMS instrument (Lonestar, Owlstone, Cambridge, UK) was used. Prior
to the analyses, the FAIMS instrument was checked for contamination
using air and water blanks. The fecal samples were thawed to room
temperature for 10 min prior to VOC analysis and manually homogenized
after diluting the fecal sample with 10 mL of tap water by using a
micropipette of 5000 μL. The Lonestar was setup as used in previous
studies.14,22,23 To transport
the sample headspace into the Lonestar, compressed air (0.1 MPa) was
used as the carrier gas. This air meets the European Pharmacopoeia
criteria for medical air, and its composition, pressure, temperature,
and water density are checked for continuality regularly. When entering
the Lonestar, this carrier gas is filtered by a carbon filter (Restek,
Bellefote, VS). The flow rate was set at 2.0 L/min, and the temperature
for the sample holder was set at 35 °C, for the lid at 70 °C,
and for the filter region at 100 °C. After every sample run,
the Lonestar was refreshed using 5 mL of tap water. Furthermore, the
dispersion field was set between 0 and 100% (in the ratio of the high
electric field to low electric field) and passed through 51 equal
settings. The compensation voltage was set between +6 V and −6
V in 512 steps for each dispersion field. All samples were analyzed
randomly. Each fecal sample was analyzed three times subsequently,
resulting in three matrices and taking 540 s to perform. In order
to preclude environmental effects, the first matrix was excluded from
analyses since this measurement includes the heaspace gas generated
from both the sample and the environment (e.g., air in tubes). For
the statistical analysis, only the second matrix was used for optimal
diagnostic potential. The third measurement was made as a back-up
file, but was not used in this study. The raw data output was analyzed
at the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, United Kingdom.15

Statistical Analysis
The demographic
data of each group
(IBD patients and healthy controls) were compared using the Mann–Whitney
U test for nonparametric continues data and the Fisher’s exact
test for dichotomous data using SPSS statistics (version 22, IBM,
NY, USA). As previously reported, the FAIMS produces high-dimensional
data in terms of the number of features and covariates measured per
sample. Therefore, a data compression was performed before feature
identification and classification. Each FAIMS data (sample) consists
of 52 224 data points in a 2D matrix. Data compression was
undertaken by applying a 2D discrete wavelet transformation. For the
variables of interest in which the accuracy to discriminate between
IBD and HC was assessed, feature selection and classifier training
were performed to 90% of data (training set), and class predictions
were produced from 10% of the data set (test set) in a 10-fold cross
validation. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to calculate p values in the training sets to identify which features
were best for disease prediction. From this, four statistically important
features were used. Four classification algorithms were applied, sparse
logistic regression, random forest, Gaussian process, and support
vector machine. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was
created to predict the area under the curve (AUC), p values, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy. For the
influence of the sampling method on VOC composition, in which IBD
and HC samples were combined and measurements of the same subjects
samples were repeated, data were analyzed using SPSS statistics 22
(IMB). The raw sensor data was recombined with feature selection using
the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Paired t tests were
performed to assess the potential of the features to discriminate
between sample handling methods. Scatterplots for the discrimination
between samples were created for each variable of interest. Axes depict
the recombination of the raw sensor data by means of the features.
Individual VOC profiles are illustrated as marked points. The intersection
of the lines deriving from the invidual VOC profiles demonstrates
the mean VOC profile of this specific variable of interest.

Post
Hoc Analyses
The main target of our study was
to assess the optimum sampling method to discriminate between IBD
and healthy controls based on VOC analyses by means of FAIMS. We found
there is a gap of knowledge on the effects of sample storage duration
on VOC integrity. Therefore, the effect of duration of storage in
the freezer was analyzed by repeating measurements from a previous
study, conducted by van Gaal et al. in which fecal VOC profiles of
36 de novo IBD patients were compared to 24 HC.14 On the basis of the availability of fecal samples from
this study, 10 IBD (all CD) subjects and 10 HC could be included for
the reassessment of VOC profiles. Storage time differed by 20 months
between the measurements, with a median storage time in the freezer
of 43 months for the first and 63 months for the second measurements.
For both these analyses, the reference standard was used. Diagnostic
accuracy to detect IBD as well as the difference in VOC profile was
assessed using the statistical analyses described above.

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Seventeen de novo, treatment-naïve
pediatric IBD patients (15 CD, 2 UC) were selected from the original
cohort and were matched to 25 HC. Patient characteristics are shown
in Table 2. There were
no significant differences in age, sex, and sample age between IBD
and HC. The range of the sample age was, however, larger in the IBD
group compared to HC.

For the assessment of the influence of
sample age on diagnostic accuracy, fecal samples of 10 IBD patients
(CD only) and 10 HC were selected from the previous study and remeasured.14 Patients’ characteristics for this variable
are described in Table 3.

Fecal VOC Profiles per Variable of Interest
The results
of the VOC analysis displayed per variable of interest are shown in Table 4. For each analysis,
the outcome of the sparse logistic regression is noted. A complete
overview of the data generated by the four different classification
models is given in SI Table 1a–d.

Standard Operating Procedure
By
the application of
the reference standard settings, IBD and HC could be differentiated
with high accuracy (accuracy, AUC (95% CI), sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, NPV, p values; 0.93, 0.99 (0.96–1), 0.94,
0.96, 0.94, 0.96, and 1.178e-10)(Table 4, SI Table 1a–d,
and Figure 1). A typical FAIMS pattern (flame) of both the IBD samples
and control samples is depicted in Figure 2.

Sample Mass
IBD
could be differentiated from HC by
using a lower sample mass, but diagnostic accuracy decreased compared
to the reference standard for both 300 mg per sample (accuracy, AUC
(95% CI), sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, p values;
0.77, 0.69 (0.52–0.86), 0.88, 0.44, 0.52, 0.85, and 0.02101)
and 100 mg per sample (accuracy, AUC (95% CI), sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, NPV, p values; 0.70, 0.74 (0.59–0.90),
0.76, 0.72, 0.65, 0.82, and 0.00364) (Table 4, SI Table 1a–d, and Figure 1).

Thaw–Freeze Cycles
After adding one extra thaw–freeze
cycle to the reference standard, a decrease in diagnostic accuracy
was observed (accuracy, AUC (95% CI), sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
NPV, p values; 0.61, 0.80 (0.65–0.94), 0.76,
0.80, 0.72, 0.83) (Table 4, SI Tables 1–4, and Figure 1). After the addition
of a second and third thaw–freeze cycle, differences in the
VOC profiles between IBD and HC dissolved (accuracy, AUC (95% CI),
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, p values; 0.64,
0.56 (0.38–0.74), 0.76, 0.48, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.7534 and 0.57,
0.50 (0.32–0.69), 0.47, 0.72, 0.53, 0.67, and 0.5101, respectively)(Table 3, SI Table 1a–d).

Duration of Storage at
Room Temperature
After keeping
the samples at room temperature for 180 min prior to VOC analysis,
the differences in VOC outcome between IBD and HC dissolved (accuracy,
AUC (95% CI), sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, p values; 0.60, 0.51 (0.32–0.70), 0.59, 0.68, 0.56, 0.71, and
0.4596) (Table 4, SI Table 1a–d).

Influence of
Sampling Method on Overall VOC Composition
In order to assess
the influence of sampling conditions on the detected
VOC patterns, HC and IBD subjects were combined to form one single
study group. The comparisons between the four features are shown in Table 5. The differences
in the VOC pattern between sampling methods are depicted in Figure 3. Both fecal samples
weighing 300 mg and 100 mg demonstrated a significantly different

feature 3 p value = 0.027 for 300 mg; features 1–4, p value <0.0001 for 100 mg). All of the variables in
thaw–freeze cycles differed to a similar extent from the reference
standard (features 1–4, p value <0.0001
for all variables). A similar difference as with the previous variables
was seen when comparing the VOC profiles of the reference standard
to the VOC profiles of samples kept at room temperature for 180 min

Post Hoc
Analyses
Duration of Storage in Freezer
The diagnostic accuracy
to discriminate IBD from controls was not influenced by differences
in the duration of storage time prior to VOC analysis (43 versus 63
months) (accuracy, AUC (95% CI), sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, p values; 0.75, 0.75 (0.53–0.97), 0.70, 0.80, 0.78,
0.73, 0.0262 versus 0.75, 0.73 (0.49–0.97), 0.80, 0.70, 0.73,
0.78, 0.0376) (Table 4, SI Table 1a–d, and Figure 1). The VOC composition of the
two variables showed a significant difference in three features (feature
1–3 with p values of <0.0001, < 0.0001,
and 0.021, respectively) (Table 5, Figure 3).

Discussion
In the present study,
VOC profiles and diagnostic accuracy were
influenced significantly by altering the sampling conditions. The
application of a 500 mg fecal sample mass diluted with 10 mL of tap
water and thawed for 10 min prior to analysis after a single thaw–freeze
cycle showed the best discriminative accuracy for the differentiation
of pediatric IBD and HC.

To our knowledge, this is the first
published study to assess under
which sampling conditions an optimal accuracy can be obtained in the
differentiation between pediatric IBD and healthy controls by analyzing
the fecal volatile metabolome using FAIMS. Studies assessing the optimization
of sampling methods for fecal metabolome analyses have mainly focused
on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS), nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy), and liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC/MS), which are targeted and untargeted methods for
the identification of specific metabolites. These studies may hypothetically
provide guidance to standardization for the pattern-based FAIMS technique.
The results of this study will be discussed and compared to the available
literature in the following sections. Regarding sample mass, similar
results to eNose, GC/MS, NMR spectroscopy, and LC/MS studies on the
fecal metabolome, in both humans and rats, were found in our study,
showing a difference between the use of 500 mg from that of lower
masses.16,24,25 Deda and colleagues
have shown that the sample weight to volume ratio has a major effect
on the number and signal intensity of features detected in fecal samples
with GC/MS. This also applied for the spectral signal intensity when
using NMR spectroscopy and for the peak area intensity when using
LC/MS.24 The increased accuracy to differentiate
between IBD and HC when using a larger fecal mass, as observed in
our study, may be explained by this increase of richness in number
and intensity of VOCs.

Observed differences in VOC profiles
between fecal samples enduring
one versus multiple thaw–freeze cycles are in line with previous
research on VOC patterns using different eNose devices.16,26 It could be hypothesized that these effects are caused by changes
in microbiota composition or function; although in a previous study
no differences were found in microbiota composition between the analyses
of fresh samples versus samples frozen at −80 °C and subsequently
thawed prior to analysis.27 A recent study
suggested a release of microbial intracellular contents following
thaw–freeze cycles, possibly explaining the effects of thaw–freeze
cycles on VOC outcomes.28 In our study,
it was shown that the diagnostic accuracy decreased with the addition
of one extra thaw–freeze cycle and that IBD could not be differentiated
from HC after the addition of multiple thaw–freeze cycles.
Consequently, future studies on fecal VOC should limit the number
of thaw–freeze cycles prior to analysis to a maximum of two.

Consistent with the results from a previous study on fecal VOCs
using an eNose device, we measured significant differences between
fecal VOC profiles measured directly after thawing (as used in the
reference standard) and after 180 min stored at room temperature with
an accuracy of 0.84.16 Furthermore, it
was demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy decreased when samples
were kept at room temperature for 180 min (AUC = 0.53). These results
are in line with a previous study on the impact of storage conditions
on crude fecal samples measured by NMR spectroscopy and showed that
metabolic variation was influenced by storage at room temperature
and at 4 °C.28 The metabolic profiles
of fecal samples did not change after keeping the samples at room
temperature for 1 h. However, samples stored for a longer time prior
to the analyses gradually shifted. The overall changes that were seen
included decreased levels of fumarate, succinate, and glutamate and
increased levels of methanol, phenylalanine, alanine, and short-chain
fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, propionate, and valerate. To
a lesser extent, the same shifts were seen in samples kept at 4 °C,
which indicates that the lower temperature slows down the impact on
sample integrity, resulting in fewer alterations in the metabolic
profile. In another study comparing VOC profiles of fecal samples
kept at 1 °C for 14 h prior to GC/MS analysis, there were no
significant changes in VOC profiles before and after 14 h.25 Since the differences between IBD and HC in
this study were analyzed by means of pattern recognition, specific
metabolic alterations cannot be elucidated in this study. However,
it could be hypothesized that the unstable VOC composition when keeping
the samples at room temperature is caused by the ongoing fermentation
by the fecal microbiota. Since fermentative processes have shown to
be reduced at lower temperature, this could explain why VOC integrity
remained stable when samples were kept at 1 and 4 °C in previous
studies.28 Another explanation is the emission
of volatiles in the sample and contamination with background volatiles.
Fermentation, emission, and contamination could be avoided by measuring
the sample directly after collection. However, clinical implementation
of VOC analyses would then become a logistics challenge.

Literature
on the influence of the storage time of fecal VOCs is
scarce. In a study assessing VOC profiles of urine using a similar
FAIMS method to the current study, a nine-month shelf life for urine
samples was suggested after it was shown that chemical information
was lost over time, regarding both diversity and the concentration
of gas emissions.29 In addition, in a previous
study assessing the effect of the sample age on serum, VOCs measured
by GC/MS showed that a significant difference in metabolite composition
was already seen after being stored for 3 weeks in the freezer.30 In the current study, fecal VOC profiles for
IBD seem less influenced by storage time compared to those in the
previous studies on urine and serum, keeping a similar (high) diagnostic
accuracy after a storage period of 43 and 63 months. Interestingly,
the samples chosen for this comparison were used in a larger study
by van Gaal et al. where an area under the curve of 0.76 was found
for a mean storage time of 23 months for the IBD group (25 CD, 21
UC) and 39 months for the HC group.14 The
increase in the AUC of this sub analysis, although analyzed at the
same moment, can be explained by the fact that the remaining samples
consisted only of CD patients and HC. In the previous study, the AUC
for the differentiation between CD and HC was 0.90. There is, however,
an important consideration to this post hoc analysis. The diagnostic
accuracy was only assessed after a median storage duration of 43 and
63 months. Since there are no previous measurements, it could be possible
that massive changes in VOC composition have influenced diagnostic
accuracy in the initial months after collection. We cannot exclude
this influence based on this study.

The main strength of this
study is that we used an IBD group and
an HC group to assess not only the differences in VOC patterns between
sampling methods but also the influence on the diagnostic accuracy
for disease detection. In addition, we used the same subjects’
samples for each of the analyses, accounting for various confounding
factors of influence on fecal VOCS (e.g., smoking habits, medication
use, diet). During each experiment, the remaining variables of interest
were kept the same, ensuring an optimal comparison based on the variable
of interest. Our study also has several limitations. Most importantly,
for the influence of storage time on diagnostic accuracy for IBD,
we have made use of raw data of a previous study and have reassessed
samples with sufficient sample mass. For this analyses we were only
able to include CD, and no UC, patients. In addition, sample age differed
between groups, which could have influenced diagnostic accuracy by
the influence of metabolic degradation on VOC profiles at both measurements.
Second, we have made use of unfiltered and unsterilized tap water
for sample dilution and compressed medical air as a carrier gas. This
protocol was chosen since it has been found to be a reliable sampling
method for the differentiation between various diseases and healthy
controls based on fecal VOCs.31−34 To avoid VOC profile contamination, we have run air
and water blanks which were checked on contamination peaks and met
the cleanliness criteria. In addition, we have analyzed the samples
in a random order and have excluded the first matrix of every sample
analysis to avoid air contamination. However, we cannot fully guarantee
the exclusion of VOC contamination by differences in tap water composition
between measurements. Third, we have not explored the difference between
the diagnostic accuracy when using fresh versus frozen samples. As
previously described, this seems to be an important influence on urine
and serum VOCs. However, since a diagnostic accuracy of 0.99 was found
in this study, we believe that freezing our samples has not significantly
influenced our study outcomes. Last, it is possible that optimized
fecal sampling conditions are disease-specific, and fecal VOC biomarkers
to diagnose IBD might have a different sensitivity to variations in
the sampling method compared to fecal VOC biomarkers for other gastrointestinal
diseases. We did, however, find significant differences in VOC profiles
between sampling methods, emphasizing the importance of the use of
one standardized sampling method. Furthermore, it is important to
point out that we made use of pattern recognition in this study, which
complicates the assessment of the influence of specific metabolites.
We have chosen to specifically validate the FAIMS method since this
device is an easy-to-use tool which could be suitable for clinical
implementation.35

This study highlights
the need for one standardized methodology,
in both a research setting and when using VOC analysis as a (future)
clinical tool. On the basis of this and previous study results, we
would like to suggest using a standardized protocol with fecal sample
masses preferably of 500 mg, no more than one thaw session prior to
VOC analysis, and the analysis of samples directly after thawing or,
if impossible, keeping the samples frozen until further analysis.
Future studies should assess the difference in diagnostic accuracy
between fresh samples and frozen samples and the influence of storage
duration using multiple-measurement moments after sample collection.

This study showed a high discriminative accuracy to differentiate
between IBD and HC when using the standard operating procedure. It
was shown that the use of less than 500 mg, multiple thaw–freeze
cycles, storage at room temperature, and storage in a freezer all
influence the diagnostic accuracy. We therefore suggest to use one
standardized protocol when performing fecal VOC analysis. In addition,
further studies should focus on finding IBD-specific VOCs to allow
for targeted pattern recognition.
