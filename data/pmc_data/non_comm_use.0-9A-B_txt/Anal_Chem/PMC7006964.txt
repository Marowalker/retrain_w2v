We
present investigations into remote liquid temperature sensing
with Raman spectroscopy using different evaluation methods for the
OH stretching vibration band. Water, ethanol, and ethanol saturated
with nitrogen, all as liquids or liquid-like supercritical fluids,
are pumped through a heated microcapillary system at elevated pressures.
Raman spectra are recorded from the liquid inside the microcapillary
and are evaluated with respect to the temperature sensitivity of the
OH stretching vibration. The four approaches applied are (i) to evaluate
the center position of the Raman OH-band, (ii) the integrated absolute
difference spectrum, (iii) the intensity ratio of two regions of the
OH-band, and (iv) the intensity ratio of two fitted Gaussian peaks.
The temperature range investigated covers from ambient temperature
to the component’s respective boiling temperature or critical
temperature at sub- and supercritical pressures. Precision and robustness
of the employed methods are characterized. It is shown that two out
of the four methods feature temperature deviations smaller than 5
K at all pressures and that one method can also be applied to liquid
mixtures of ethanol and nitrogen. Applicability to other liquids and
mixtures is discussed.

==== Body
Whenever
it has to be assured
that the action of measuring temperature does not disturb the system
from which the temperature should be sensed, remote thermometry strategies
are the first choice. This can be, for example, in spray research
when a physical temperature probe would invade into the flow and into
the heat and mass transfer processes going on in the spray. Similar
examples can be found in different kinds of reacting or nonreacting
flows. Therefore, the provision of optical measurement techniques
for the remote and noninvasive measurement of temperature is essential
for analyzing, understanding and controlling a variety of operations
in process technology.

Out of the numerous methods for fluid
thermometry,1,2 spontaneous Raman spectroscopy
is one that does not rely on the
addition of a temperature indicator and thus can provide spatially
and temporally resolved temperature from the unspoiled fluid itself.
The extraction of temperature from a Raman spectrum can be based on
different temperature sensitive features of an assemblage of molecules
that are reflected in the Raman spectrum. This can be (i) the temperature
sensitive occupation distribution across energy levels (rotational
Raman thermometry3−5 vibrational Raman thermometry including Q-branch
Raman thermometry,6 hot-band Raman thermometry,7 and Stokes/anti-Stokes Raman thermometry,8 or (ii) the temperature sensitive development
of a hydrogen bonding network. The temperature sensitive development
of hydrogen bonds has been analyzed from the point of physical chemistry9−12 and has been exploited for remote Raman thermometry in water,13,14 ammonia,15 and alcohol16,17 containing systems. The temperature sensitive development of hydrogen
bonds influences the eigenfrequency of the intramolecular Raman active
vibrations between the nuclei that are involved in the hydrogen bonding
network. These are the symmetric stretching vibration and the bending
vibration of water and the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group
of alcohols, whose eigenfrequencies in a system containing hydrogen
bonds are broadly distributed and on average less than in a not hydrogen
bonded system. For example, the symmetric water stretching vibration
of water vapor (no hydrogen bonds) results in a distinct, sharp peak
at a Raman-shift of 3650 cm–1, while that of liquid
water (hydrogen bonds) forms a broad Raman band at Raman-shifts between
3000 and 3800 cm–1. We refer to the symmetric stretching
vibration of water and to the stretching vibration of alcohols as
OH stretching vibration and to its resulting Raman spectrum as the
Raman OH-band. According to literature, one can find different correlations
between the temperature sensitive development of hydrogen bonds and
the different characteristics of the OH stretching vibration Raman
signal. Some correlations divide the Raman OH-band into portions and
consider their temperature sensitive ratio/distribution16,18,19 Other correlations consider the
temperature sensitive shift of the central band position or of the
centroid of the band,20 and still others
are based on contour fits or indirect hard modeling methods21

For Raman thermometry applications, these
correlations have (i)
never been analyzed at elevated pressure, which significantly extends
the temperature range at which alcohols or water are still in the
liquid state and (ii) seldom for mixtures instead of pure compounds.

We here report four different approaches of correlating the Raman
OH-band of water, ethanol, and a mixture of ethanol and nitrogen with
the temperature in the temperature range from room temperature to
the critical temperature.

Experimental Section
Instrumentation
The experimental setup is schematically
depicted in Figure 1. Water or ethanol are continuously fed in controlled flow rates
to the setup via a high precision high pressure syringe pump (labeled
“pump 1”). At a T-junction, the liquid flow can be mixed
with defined amounts of gaseous nitrogen fed via a mass flow controller.
From this junction on, the fluid stream runs through a microcapillary
(labeled “capillary”) with an inner diameter of 300
μm and an outer diameter of 800 μm made out of fused silica.
Both gas and liquid feed can be varied independently, allowing for
mixture compositions from pure ethanol or water to pure nitrogen.
The glass capillary is set in a steel block (labeled “heating
block”) of 300 mm length with four heating cartridges inserted
horizontally and symmetrically placed. Two of these are depicted in Figure 1, as well as three
of the six type K thermocouples equidistantly placed along the capillary
to monitor the temperature (up to 700 ± 0.2 K), set vertically
in the block. Access holes drilled into the steel block allow for
optical access (two of five shown), and thus the acquisition of Raman
spectra by the Raman probe. For better understanding of the layout
of the heating block, Figure 2 shows a sectional rendered image. Downstream of the steel
block, another high pressure pump (labeled “pump 2”)
is operated in reverse mode to receive the fluid and control the pressure
of the system at pulsation free conditions up to 30 MPa.

Figure 1 Schematic overview
of the experimental setup.

Figure 2 Rendered sectional image of the heating block with heating cartridge,
thermocouples, and access hole pointed out.

If the fed flow rates result in a mixture composition located
in
the miscibility gap, the flow in the glass capillary will separate
in alternating liquid phase and vapor phase segments in a harmonic
pattern (picture in Figure 3). The fluid segments have a length of typically 2 mm, and
thus a high surface compared to their volume; furthermore, the radial
surface is high compared to their volume. Heat and mass transfer processes
have thus only to overcome short characteristic lengths. This results
in extremely fast establishment of thermodynamic equilibrium while
the fluid accommodates to the temperature of the steel block almost
immediately while propagating through it. This means the liquid segments
are saturated even at high temperatures in the measurement position
(as long as the two-phase flow persists), and measurements in saturated
liquid phases are possible.

Figure 3 Picture of the segmented flow in the glass capillary.

Via the optical access located
furthest downstream, Raman spectra
are recorded from the fluids inside the capillary. The excitation
source is a continuous wave laser operating at 150 mW at 532 nm. The
Raman signals are excited and acquired in backscattering configuration
by the Raman probe shown in Figure 1 and spectrally resolved and quantified with a fiber-coupled
spectrometer. When measuring in pure liquids, i.e., the fluid is in
single phase, Raman spectra can easily be detected by applying 4 s
integration time. In a segmented two-phase flow, this would result
in superposition of signal originating from both phases. To discriminate
between the two phases, and render phase-selective measurements possible,
a photodetector is placed beneath the measurement position. This photoelectric
guard detects the light of the laser passing through the capillary,
varying in intensity with the current state of phase of the fluid
in the measurement position. The resulting voltage signal outlined
on the oscilloscope in Figure 1 allows for discrimination between vapor and liquid phase
and consequently triggering the acquisition of Raman spectra of the
desired phase. When the voltage signal on the oscilloscope indicates
the start of a fluid segment of the desired phase to be measured,
a trigger is sent to the fiber-switch shown in Figure 1 between the Raman probe and spectrometer.
This fiber-switch directs the signal from the Raman probe to the spectrometer
for a defined duration and switches the signal path to a signal dump
afterward. A harmonic pattern of fluid segments and a stationary flow
are crucial for this method to work. When the oscilloscope detects
the arrival of the next fluid segment of the desired phase, the signal
path is switched back to the spectrometer. Thus, the spectrometer
can accumulate signal for 4 s continuously, while the signal will
actually only arrive when the trigger system allows it. Typically,
the frequency of segment passes of the same phase state is 3–6
Hz, and the trigger widths are set between 60 to 20 ms, respectively.
From these values, an effective integration time of approximately
0.5 s is calculated for the two-phase flow case.

Methods
We performed measurements with water at 0.5,
5, 10, 15, 20, 22.5, and 25 MPa, as well as with ethanol and ethanol
saturated with nitrogen at 3, 5, 6, 6.5, and 8 MPa. After starting
the fluid flow and setting the desired pressure, the temperature is
increased in 10 K steps from ambient temperature to the fluid’s
boiling point or critical point (with respect to the set pressure).
At each step, 32 spectra are recorded with 4 s integration time. The
broad Raman OH-band of the spectra, stemming from the hydrogen bond
network developed by water and ethanol, is evaluated due to its strong
response to temperature variation. With increasing temperature, the
intensities of the Raman OH-band at higher Raman-shifts increase,
while the intensities at lower Raman-shifts decrease. Figuratively
speaking, the Raman OH-band shifts weight to higher Raman-shifts,
as is seen in Figure 4. Four methods reported in the literature are applied and compared,
each aiming to obtain a single value correlated with temperature from
a spectrum. Each data point in the following figures represents the
mean out of 32 measurements, and the error bars show the respective
standard deviation.

Materials
Chemicals used in this work were: distilled
water (Tc = 647 K, pc = 22.1 MPa) according to ISO 3696 purchased form Kerndl,
ethanol (Tc = 514 K, pc = 6.14 MPa) with a purity of more than 99.9% purchased
from Merck Millipore, and nitrogen (Tc = 126 K, pc = 3.39 MPa) with more than
99.99% purity purchased from Praxair.

Results and Discussion
OHcenter Method
The OHcenter method
relies on the shift of the central Raman-shift v̅center of the Raman OH-band to higher values with increasing
temperature. This is shown for two example spectra from liquid water
in Figure 4 at 10 MPa
and 333 and 431 K. To calculate v̅center, the Raman OH-band is divided into two parts of equal integrated
intensity, i.e., area. Figure 5 shows this correlation as the set system temperature Tsys over the respective central Raman-shift v̅center. The R2 values greater 0.999 for all data sets indicate agreement of the
fit equation and the experimental data. The equations fitted to the
data in this work can be found in the Supporting Information.

ethanol saturated with nitrogen.

Bottom: Difference of calculated
temperature Tcalc from set system temperature Tsys, when Tcalc is

to the fit equations given in the top section of this figure.

One can use the fit functions
for the computation of temperature Tcalc as a function of the central
Raman-shift v̅center of the Raman
OH-band. For water, the correlation between the set system temperature Tsys and the central Raman-shift v̅center of the Raman OH-band is best described by a third-order
polynomial function resulting in residuals Tcalc – Tsys smaller than 5 K over the whole temperature range covered. Second-order
polynomial fitting for water can be found in literature, however this
only applies to temperature intervals smaller than 100 K. Both ethanol
and ethanol-nitrogen can be adequately described by a second-order
polynomial, yielding calculated temperatures Tcalc with less than 5 K deviation from the set
system temperature Tsys at all investigated
temperatures. The correlations for pure ethanol and for the ethanol
saturated with nitrogen are similar to each other. This is due to
the rather small solubility of nitrogen in liquid ethanol (smaller
than 4 mol % for all temperatures and pressures analyzed)
and due to the little disturbance a dissolved nitrogen molecule causes
to the hydrogen bonded network22

IADS Method
The integrated absolute difference spectrum
(IADS) method evaluates the area normalized Raman OH-band with respect
to an area normalized reference Raman OH-band taken at well-known
conditions. The area normalized reference spectrum for water shown
in Figure 6 was taken
at 295 K and 10 MPa. Figure 6 shows that the absolute value of the difference between the
area normalized reference Raman OH-band and the area normalized measured
Raman OH-band is computed and provided as an absolute difference spectrum.
As the shape of the Raman OH-band is a function of temperature, the
absolute difference spectrum is also a function of temperature. Figure 7 correlates the set
system temperature Tsys with the area
under the absolute difference spectrum (integrated absolute difference
IAD).

taken at 295 K and a measured spectrum of water taken at 431 K, both

ethanol, and ethanol saturated with nitrogen.

Bottom: Difference
of calculated temperature Tcalc from set system temperature Tsys, when Tcalc is computed
according to the fit equations given in the top section
of this figure.

The R2 values greater 0.9995 indicate
agreement between the experimentally measured data points and the
fit functions. For water, the correlation of the IAD and Tsys are fitted with a third-order polynomial, while the
respective correlations are fitted with second-order polynomials for
the systems containing pure ethanol or ethanol saturated with nitrogen.
According to the bottom part of Figure 7, the temperatures calculated from the obtained fit
functions show precision far better than 5 K.

The difference
between data from pure ethanol and the ethanol–nitrogen
mixture appears to be even smaller compared to the OHcenter method, stemming from an inherent correction mechanism of this method:
The impact of dissolved nitrogen on the Raman OH-band in the case
of the ethanol–nitrogen mixture is already accounted for by
applying a reference spectrum from ethanol saturated with nitrogen.

Two-Color Method
The most straightforward method in
this work is the two-color method. The spectrum is divided into two
partial spectra at an arbitrary position v̅2-color, and each of the resulting partial spectra
is integrated and the ratio R2-color of the integrals is calculated according to the equation inserted
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Raman OH-band
of water at 295 K and 10 MPa with dividing position v̅2-color The resulting partial
spectra are colorized, and the equation for calculating the ratio
of the integrated partial spectra is given.

The resulting ratio R2-color is correlated to the set system temperature Tsys, shown in Figure 9 The data for all three systems are fitted by fourth-order
polynomial functions. Even though lower orders are preferable, neither
they nor any other function were found to describe the behavior adequately.
The calculated temperatures show residuals Tcalc – Tsys from the set
system temperature of up to 10 K. The location of the divider v̅2-color has a large influence
on the ratio R2-color and has to
be chosen with care. It seems to be plausible to place the divider
at the quasi-isosbestic point, i.e., the intersection of two spectra
taken at consecutive temperatures 10 K apart to achieve a high variation
with temperature. Unfortunately, this point is not at a constant position
but instead shifts to larger Raman-shifts with increasing temperatures.
Between 295 and 304 K, this point would lie at 3350 cm–1 yet between 592 and 601 K at 3515 cm–1. When placing
the divider at too small Raman-shifts, the signal will occur almost
completely to the right of the divider at high temperatures. The ratio
of areas will then approach infinity. On the other hand, if the divider
is placed at larger Raman-shifts, the gradient of the correlation
at low temperatures is very steep, reducing the precision of the temperature
determination in this temperature region tremendously. As a trade-off
between these two scenarios, the divider v̅2-color was positioned at 3500 cm–1 in this work.

a function of 2-color ratio for pure water, ethanol, and ethanol saturated
with nitrogen. Bottom: Difference of calculated temperature Tcalc from set system temperature Tsys, when Tcalc is computed according to the fit equations given
in the top section of this figure.

Gauss Method
A method bearing some similarity to the
2-color method is the Gauss method, where the Raman OH-band is fitted
by Gaussian peaks, and the ratio of the integrated intensities RGauss of these peaks acts as the value correlated
with temperature. Here we use two Gauss peaks, while also more Gauss
peaks can be used for fitting the Raman OH-band.10 In Figure 10, an example water spectrum taken at 295 K and 10 MPa with
two fitted Gaussian peaks is shown as well as the resulting fitted
envelope. The correlation of the set system temperature Tsys over RGauss in Figure 11 reveals the major
issue of this approach: The data up to a RGauss of 0.2 follow no mathematical function that could be fitted. This
stems from the setup of the Gauss fitting algorithm, which can either
allow for free movement of the peaks in terms of Raman-shift, or can
fix the position of the Gaussians to a certain value. The first option
means giving up uniqueness of the correlation because the same ratio
may occur at different temperatures when the peaks do not change their
area with temperature and simply are located at different Raman-shifts.
Their ratio would then yield two possible temperature solutions when
calculating Tcalc. The
second option, keeping the peaks in place, is applicable over small
temperature intervals, where the changes in the Raman OH-band are
small enough to allow for satisfactory fitting by two Gaussians fixed
in position. Considering the temperature ranges covered in this work,
the approach fails; in extreme cases, one peak would be fitted with
zero intensity and ratio calculation would thus become useless. For
this reason, we abstained from fitting the data points and calculating
temperatures based on the fits. Using more than two peaks for fitting
the Raman OH-band reduces these problems but does not eliminate them10

Gaussian
peaks with fitted envelope.

Figure 11 Set system temperature Tsys as a function
of Gauss peak area ratios for water, pure ethanol, and ethanol saturated
with nitrogen.

Comparison of Methods
With the described inability
of the Gauss method to yield a reliable fitted function over the complete
temperature range, we omit this method from further considerations.
For the other three methods, the mean absolute deviation Tdiff, system of the calculated temperature Tsys and system temperature Tsys, as well as the respective standard deviation, are
given in Table 1. The
mean absolute temperature deviations of the methods OHcenter and IADS appear to have a significant advantage over the 2-color
method for ethanol and the ethanol–nitrogen mixture. The IADS
method should be the preferred one, providing at least 20% less standard
deviation compared to the OHcenter method and performing
superior for water. Furthermore, the relative thermal sensitivities
at 433 K, calculated as Sr = (δQ/δT)/Q, where Q is the respective signal value, of the methods OHcenter and IADS for the respective systems water, ethanol,
and ethanol–nitrogen are given in Table 2.

Pressure Dependence
The data shown so far comprise
measurements performed at different pressures, assuming negligible
pressure dependence of the spectra. To show that this assumption holds
true, Figure 12 shows
the respective correlation value for the methods OHcenter and IADS at a temperature of 433 K (approximate center of the investigated
temperature interval) over pressure for the three systems water, pure
ethanol, and ethanol–nitrogen. The OHcenter method
shows a shift of v̅center of 5 cm–1 from 0.5 to 25 MPa, converting to
an error in calculated temperature Tcalc of less than 10 K. This error adds to the standard deviation in
the plots (see Figure 5, bottom). For pure ethanol, this error from 3 to 8 MPa also converts
to less than 10 K, while no significant pressure dependence is found
for ethanol–nitrogen with the OHcenter method. The
IADS method exhibits no pressure dependence whatsoever due to the
fact that each pressure set has its own reference spectrum taken at
the respective system pressure, canceling out any pressure effects.

Conclusion
Four
methods for the liquid phase temperature measurement with
Raman spectroscopy in fluids developing hydrogen bonds were compared.
To the first of our knowledge, this was done by covering the pressure
range from slightly elevated pressures (0.5 MPa) to supercritical
pressures with respect to ethanol and water and the accompanying temperature
range from ambient temperature to phase transition or transition from
liquid-like to gas-like supercritical state. It was shown that the
IADS method is superior in pure fluids as well as mixtures, closely
followed by the OHcenter method. IADS is a mathematically
simple approach and appears to be promising even in mixtures containing
higher amounts of solvent. The methods are applicable throughout the
liquid-like temperature range at supercritical pressures, where a
sudden change in the shape of the Raman OH-band indicates the transition
to the gas-like region. Concerning mixtures, the measurement approach
is limited regardless of evaluation method to the persistence of a
hydrogen bond network. With increasing dilution of the hydrogen bond
developing compound, the sensitivity of the thus inhibited hydrogen
bond network to temperature variations will decrease. Yet we could
not detect significant negative impacts within the investigated ethanol–nitrogen
mixture of up to 4 mol % nitrogen.
