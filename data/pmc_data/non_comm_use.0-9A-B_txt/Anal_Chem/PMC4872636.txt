Studies of transcriptomes are critical
for understanding gene expression.
Release of RNA molecules from cells is typically the first step for
transcriptomic analysis. Effective cell lysis approaches that completely
release intracellular materials are in high demand especially for
cells that are structurally robust. In this report, we demonstrate
a microfluidic electric lysis device that is effective for mRNA extraction
from mycobacteria that have hydrophobic and waxy cell walls. We used
a packed bed of microscale silica beads to filter M. smegmatis out of the suspension. 4000–8000 V/cm field intensity was
used to lyse M. smegmatis with long pulses (i.e.,
up to 30 pulses that were 5 s long each). Our quantitative reverse
transcription (qRT)-PCR results showed that our method yielded a factor
of 10–20 higher extraction efficiency than the current state-of-the-art
method (bead beating). We conclude that our electric lysis technique
is an effective approach for mRNA release from hard-to-lyse cells
and highly compatible with microfluidic molecular assays.

Profiling
transcriptomes (the
set of all RNA molecules) is critical for understanding the functional
elements of the genome and disease processes.1 Various technologies have been developed in recent years, such as
real time PCR,2 microarrays,3 and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),1,4,5 to detect and quantify mRNA for understanding
physiological events. The purity and integrity of input RNA are critical
for the success of these RNA-based analysis. Compromise in RNA quality
leads to variable results.6,7 There is a growing demand
for mRNA extraction methods that allow transcriptomic profiling of
all species.

Mycobacteria are nonmotile, aerobic, and acid-fast
bacteria, including
highly pathogenic species that cause tuberculosis and leprosy.8 Compared to other bacteria, mycobacteria have
a thick cell wall that is hydrophobic, waxy, and rich in mycolic acids/mycolates.
Analysis of intracellular contents from mycobacteria is challenging
due to this structural characteristic.

Several methods have
been developed for RNA isolation from bacteria.
Chemical disruption, including the TRIzol-based method9,10 and hot-phenol-based method,11 is traditionally
used for bacteria RNA extraction. However, the procedures are usually
tedious and time-consuming, taking several hours to a few days.12,13 The chemicals (SDS and phenol) involved in these procedures often
cause RNA fragmentation and result in variability in RNA quality and
analysis results.13 Bead beating is considered
to be the state of the art for RNA extraction from lysis-resistant
bacterial cells including mycobacteria.14 TRIzol is often added in bead beating to improve RNA stability and
facilitate cell wall disruption (via denaturing proteins and inhibiting
RNases).15 Bacterial cells and beads are
contained in a closed tube and then subject to high-frequency oscillation.
The high shear stress generated by periodic vertical flow leads to
mechanical lysis. This procedure is typically applied to a large number
of cells (>108 cells). This creates difficulty for studying
slow-growing mycobacteria and probing a low number of cells.16 Such release tends to be incomplete. The mechanical
mechanism is also hard to replicate on a microfluidic device.

Electric lysis is a rapid physical method for cell membrane disruption
and intracellular content release.17,18 Electric lysis
typically refers to irreversible cell electroporation that occurs
under application of electrical pulses with defined intensity and
duration. When the field intensity and duration of these electrical
pulses exceed certain threshold (that is specific to the cell type),
cells are irreversibly lysed and intracellular molecules are released
into the surrounding solution. Electric lysis can be completed rapidly
(within seconds to minutes) and does not involve the use of chemical/biological
reagents that may potentially interfere with downstream assays. Although
electroporation has been extensively utilized for releasing intracellular
proteins,17−19 there has been very little work on using it to release
nucleic acids in general.20−22 None of the previous works examined
the effectiveness of electric lysis on mycobacteria that are generally
considered highly resistant to most lysis methods.

Here, we
describe a rapid mRNA extraction from Mycobacterium
smegmatis under ultrahigh-intensity (up to 8000 V/cm) electric
lysis on a microfluidic device. We formed a packed bed of microscale
silica beads in the device to trap the mycobacterial cells. Electric
pulses were then applied to electrically lyse trapped M. smegmatis within 3 min. Cell lysate was directly used for quantitative reverse
transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis without further treatment. We show
that our mRNA extraction efficiency was 10–20 times higher
than bead beating.

Material and Methods
Microfluidic Chip Fabrication
and Operation
A two-layered
PDMS chip was fabricated by multilayer soft lithography.23,24 Photomasks were designed by Freehand MX (Macromedia, San Francisco,
CA) and printed on transparency film at 4000 dpi resolution. The fluidic
layer master was fabricated in SU-8 2002 (Microchem, Newton, MA) and
AZ 9260 (Clariant, Charlotte, NC) with the thickness being 2 and 10
μm, respectively. Micropillars were placed in fluidic chambers
to avoid collapse. The master was heated at 130 °C for 30 s to
form a rounded cross-sectional profile for the features in AZ 9260.
The control layer master was fabricated in SU-2025 with 24 μm
thickness. The control layer was made by spinning PDMS prepolymers
(RTV615A/RTV615B = 20:1, R. S. Hughes, Sunnyvale, CA) at 500 rpm for
10 s and then at 1700 rpm for 30 s. This resulted in a thickness of
67 μm for the control layer PDMS. The fluidic layer had a composition
of RTV615A/RTV615B = 5:1 and a thickness of ∼0.4 cm. Both layers
of PDMS were cured at 80 °C for 15 min. The two layers were then
aligned, brought into contact, and baked for 1 h at 80 °C. The
two-layered PDMS structure was then peeled off from the control layer
master, and access holes were punched. Glass slides (VWR, Radnor,
PA) were cleaned in a basic solution (H2O/27% NH4OH/30% H2O2 = 5:1:1, volumetric ratio) at 80
°C for 1 h, rinsed with ultrapure water, and blown dry using
nitrogen. Finally, the PDMS structure was bonded to the precleaned
glass slide after plasma oxidation of both surfaces (Harrick Plasma,
Ithaca, NY) and baked at 80 °C for 1 h for further strengthening
of the device.

We wrote two LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin,
TX) programs to operate on-chip pneumatic valves and generate electric
pulses with designated duration/direction, all via a DAQ card (NI
SCB-68 from National Instruments).20,24,25 One program controlled actuation of on-chip pneumatic
valves (under a pressure of 25 psi) via operation of solenoid valves
(18801003-12VDC, ASCO Scientific, Florham Park, NJ). The other defined
the pulse duration and direction. Two platinum electrodes were inserted
into the reservoirs at inlet 2 and the outlet with direct contact
to the solution (Figure 1). The two electrodes were connected to DC voltage provided by a
high voltage power supply (PS350/5000V-25W, Stanford Research System,
Sunnyvale, CA) via an H-bridge circuit. The H-bridge circuit consisted
of 4 high voltage reed relays (5501-05-1, Coto Technology, Kingstown,
RI). Two of the relays worked together (by switching closed and then
open at the same time) to generate a pulse of defined duration in
one direction (while the other two relays remained open). On the other
hand, when the other two relays were actuated in the same fashion,
a pulse in the opposite direction was generated. To eliminate potential
pH changes in the electroporation solution due to electrolysis of
water under long pulses, we applied a series of pulses by changing
the current direction after each pulse. In this study, each individual
pulse was 5 s in duration and there was a 2 s interval between pulses.

Figure 1 Experimental
setup for conducting ultrahigh-intensity electrolysis
of M. smegmatis. Electric pulses were applied across
a PDMS microfluidic channel via two platinum electrodes. Pulses were
generated by cutting off constant voltage generated by a power supply.
The pulse duration and direction were set in a LabVIEW program that
operated a H-bridge circuit (consisting of 4 high-voltage relays)
via a data acquisition (DAQ) card. The two-layered microfluidic device
contained two pneumatic valves. The dimensions of the electrolysis
channel were 800 μm × 200 μm × 10 μm.
There were circular supporting pillars in the large chambers to prevent
collapsing.

Cell Culture
Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2 155 expressing green fluorescent
protein (GFP) was cultured
in lysogeny broth (LB) with 0.05% Tween 80 and 100 μg/μL
hygromycin at 37 °C under continuous shaking at 200 rpm. The
cell culture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended
in H2O. The concentration of the cell culture was estimated
by McFarland standards.

RNA Extraction by Bead Beating
The
cell culture was
centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min; 5 ×109 to 1010 cells (with the actual value calculated on the basis of
optical density reading taken with a spectrophotometer) were then
resuspended in 1 mL of TRIzol (Life Technologies). The mixture was
then transferred into a lysing matrix B bead beating tube (MP Biochemicals,
Santa Ana, CA) on ice. Chloroform (300 μL) was added, and the
bead beating tube was shaken vigorously. Bead beating using maximum
power was conducted twice (45 s the first time and 30 s the second
time), with a 5 min rest time in between. The mixture was centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the top aqueous
layer was collected. The sample was mixed with 600 μL of isopropanol
and stored at −20 °C overnight. The RNA sample was centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 75% ethanol,
and resuspended in H2O.

qRT-PCR Assay
Cell lysate was eluted from the microfluidic
device by 20 μL of RNase-free water and then mixed with 1×
RNasecure Reagent (Life Technologies) to deactivate RNases and protect
the integrity of RNA. The mixture was incubated at 60 °C for
10 min and then cooled to 4 °C. The samples were directly used
in qRT-PCR (four pairs of primers are listed in Table S1) or stored at −20 °C until use. qPCR
assays were performed in 20 μL aliquots in a Real-Time PCR Detection
System (CFX Connect, BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA). Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT
1-Step Kit (Life Technologies) was used to measure mRNA copy numbers
following the manufacturer’s protocol. A pair of primers (100
nM each) was added into each aliquot. The mixture was incubated at
48 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription. The mixture was then
denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C
for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s for DNA amplification. No-template
controls (NTCs) were included to monitor nonspecific amplification.

RNA Standard Synthesis and Quantification
We established
a standard curve to link the copy number of mRNA with qPCR signal
(Ct value). In vitro transcribed RNA was used
as the template to generate the standard curve. Each of the four pairs
of primers in Table S1 with added T7 promoter
sequence (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) was used
to amplify a specific mRNA (from total RNA extracted by bead beating)
by RT-PCR for 40 cycles. The size of RT-PCR products was verified
by gel electrophoresis (Figure S1). The
amplification product (DNA) contained the T7 promotor sequence on
both ends that could be recognized by T7 phage RNA polymerases. About
75 ng of amplification product was mixed with nucleotides (0.5 mM
in final concentration), T7 polymerase, and 1× transcription
buffer polymerases (MAXIscript T7 in vitro transcription kit, Life
Technologies) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. TURBO DNase 1 was
added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to digest template DNA.
Twenty-five mM EDTA was used to stop digestion and block heat-induced
RNA degradation. The produced RNA was purified twice by precipitating
with ammonium acetate/ethanol to remove unincorporated NTPs and DNase.
The copy number of the RNA was measured by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer
with Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). The RNA was serially
diluted to generate samples for the standard curve using qRT-PCR.

COMSOL Modeling
COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3 (Burlington,
MA) was used to simulate the electric field intensity in the microfluidic
chamber. The “Electric Current (ec)” module was used
to study the steady state of the model. The 3-D model was based on
the actual geometry of the microfluidic structures with the exception
of the packed bed. Because the resistivity of silica beads (1 ×
1013 Ωm) is much higher than that of water (2 ×
105 Ωm), we treated silica beads as electrically
insulating. Thus, the segment that contained the packed bed was treated
as having a cross-sectional area smaller than that of the channel
(with the equivalent cross-sectional area occupied by the insulating
beads deducted). Water was used in all other domains with electrical
conductivity of 5.5 × 10–6 S/m. To simplify
the modeling, we did not consider gas bubbles and treated the solution
as static.

The modeling is based on the governing equation: 1  where D is electric flux
density and J is the electric current density.

The electric current density is expressed by 2  where σ is the electrical conductivity
and E is electric field. The electric flux density
(D) is also expressed by 3  where ϵ0 is the
vacuum permeability
and ϵr is relative permeability. The system was electrically
insulated on all boundaries. 786 V across the two reservoirs was applied.

Results and Discussion
We designed a two-layered microfluidic
electric lysis chip (Figure 1). There were two
inlets and one outlet. The depth of channels and chambers in the fluidic
layer was 10 μm with the exception of the shallow channels (having
a depth of 2 μm). Prior to the experiment, the device was primed
by flowing water in via both inlets, removing debris and bubbles.
Microscale silica beads (d ∼ 4.8 μm,
SS05N, Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN) and mycobacterial cells (M. smegmatis) then flowed into the device via inlet 1, while
keeping valve 2 closed. A 20 μL mixture of beads and cells (∼2
× 107 cell/mL) was packed against the downstream shallow
channel to form a packed bed in the electrolysis channel with mycobacterial
cells trapped inside. In our experiment, roughly 2 × 105 cells were captured in the electrolysis channel each time and loading
of cells and beads was stopped by closing valve 1. Two platinum (Pt)
electrodes were inserted in the inlet 2 and the outlet for application
of electric pulses. Valve 1 was closed and there was a flow of 1 μL/min
coming in from inlet 2 during the application of the electric pulses.

Compared to electric lysis of bacterial cells such as E.
coli,18,25 electric lysis of M.
smegmatis required significantly longer pulse duration and
higher field intensity. Several features of our device and operation
were designed to accommodate these requirements. First, we found that
even low-conductivity buffer (e.g., 1 mM MgSO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, and 250
mM sucrose) used in our previous works26−30 generated too many bubbles when the field intensity
was >2000 V/cm). Thus, we flowed ultrapure water (RNase-free) during
the application of electric pulses. Second, we applied a flow of 1
μL/min (coming from inlet 2) during application of electric
pulses. The flow carried away generated heat and bubbles during the
operation. Finally, we programmed the LabVIEW code and designed an
H-bridge circuit (including four relays) so that the direction of
the electric field was alternated after each pulse (of 5s duration).
This was to prevent significant local pH change due to electrolysis
of water associated with long pulses.

Other than the channel
dimensions and the voltage applied, the
field intensity of the pulses was affected by the presence of nonconductive
beads. There was a substantially higher resistance associated with
the packed bed of beads than that of the same channel segment without
the beads. We used COMSOL Multiphysics to model the field intensity
within the packed bed (Figure S2). We show
that the presence of the packed bed significantly increased the local
field intensity (by ∼3×) (compared to the channel segment
without beads).

We used a M. smegmatis strain
that expressed green
fluorescent protein (GFP). In Figure 2, we show the process of bead/cell packing and the
electrolysis-based release of intracellular materials. The initial
stopping of beads at the interface of the shallow channel and the
electrolysis channel (Figure 2a) led to the formation of a packed bed with mycobacterial
cells trapped in the gaps among beads (Figure 2b). The fluorescence emitted from the cells
was observed in Figure 2c before electrolysis and disappeared after electrolysis by 20, 5
s pulses with a field intensity of 6000 V/cm (Figure 2d), suggesting release of intracellular molecules
(also see Video S1).

channel and started to accumulate in the electrolysis channel. (b)

expressing M. smegmatis cells before electrolysis.
The packed bed roughly contained 2 × 105 cells. (d)
Fluorescence image after electrolysis (30 pulses of 6000 V/cm and
5 s each).

We quantified the amount of RNA
release by electrolysis using quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The RNA
extraction was quantified by 4  where 1581.1 and 3.0 ×
10–7 were parameters extracted from the working
curve in Figure S3. Intercept and slope
were calculated
for each mRNA in Figure S4. Ct was the RT-qPCR signal. The number of GFP-expressing
mycobacterial cells trapped in the packed bed was estimated on the
basis of the amount of emitted fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity
(FI) was the average of 10 z-stacking images that covered the entire
depth of the packed bed (taken after the GFP-expressing mycobacterial
cells occupied the packed bed). DNA% was the fraction of a mRNA copy
per cell value contributed by DNA (Figure S5). Packed bed volume (V) was calculated by 5  

We characterized RNA extraction
efficiency by the electrolysis
protocol under various pulse numbers (2 to 30 pulses, all at 6000
V/cm) and field intensities (4000–8000 V/cm, all with 30 pulses)
(Figure 3). We quantified
the copy number per cell for 4 representative mRNAs in the cell lysate
under various electric lysis conditions and compared them with those
with bead beating (i.e., the conventional lysis method). The number
of cells in the electrolysis channel was quantified by fluorescence,
as shown in Figure S3. RNA quantification
was based on standard curves established using in vitro transcribed RNAs, which offered more accuracy than using bulk RNA,
cDNA, or DNA-based quantification.31Figure 3a shows that there
was no substantial release of mRNA (under 2 or 4 pulses at 6000 V/cm)
until the number of pulses increased to 10. The amount of mRNA release
increased with higher number of pulses (from 10 to 20 and 30). Some
genes experienced a drastic increase with the number of pulses (e.g.,
SigA from 6.3 copies/cell at 10 pulses to 16.9 and 20.7 copies/cell
at 20 and 30 pulses, respectively, and ClpX from 3.0 copies/cell at
10 pulses to 12.6 and 18.7 copies/cell at 20 and 30 pulses). The results
suggest that a significant number of pulses (or total electrolysis
duration) was required to create sufficient cell wall damage for M. smegmatis and complete release of intracellular RNAs.
Overall, electrolysis provided significantly more complete release
of intracellular mRNAs than the current state of the art (i.e., bead
beating). We release a factor of 18 and 10 more RNA molecules with
30 pulses than bead beating, for SigA and ClpX, respectively. Furthermore,
we also examined the effect of the pulse intensity. As expected, increased
field intensity of the pulses from 4000 to 6000 V/cm increased the
mRNA release significantly for all genes examined (when the number
of pulses was kept at 30). However, a further increase from 6000 to
8000 V/cm did not produce significant additional increase. This indicates
that, with 30 pulses at 6000 V/cm, the release of mRNA was fairly
complete. Further increase in the field intensity or duration did
not produce better results and could potentially lead to loss of integrity
and function for mRNA due to heating.

Figure 3 Release of mRNA under various conditions
for M. smegmatis. The released copy number per cell
for 4 mRNAs was quantified using
qRT-PCR (n = 3). The copy per cell values for microfluidics-produced
samples were calibrated by deducting the fraction generated by DNA
templates in the cell lysate (Figure S5). (a) The effect of pulse numbers and comparison to bead beating.
Various numbers of pulses (5 s duration for each pulse with 6000 V/cm
intensity) were applied. (b) The effect of pulse intensity. In each
case, 30 pulses (5 s each) were applied.

Our results demonstrate that electrolysis of hard-to-lyse
mycobacterial
cells can be conducted with high efficiency under ultrahigh field
intensity in a microfluidic device. Our microfluidic lysis protocol
takes less than 30 min for each sample (including cell capture, lysis,
and elution) and may potentially be run in parallel for high throughput
of samples. Our microfluidic platform offers advantages for handling
small quantities of cells and integration with downstream assays.
