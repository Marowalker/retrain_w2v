Selective reagent ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry with
NO+ as the reagent ion (SRI-TOF-MS (NO+)) was
applied for near real-time monitoring of selected skin-borne constituents
which are potential markers of human presence. The experimental protocol
involved a group of 10 healthy volunteers enclosed in a body plethysmography
chamber mimicking the entrapment environment. A total of 12 preselected
omnipresent in human scent volatiles were quantitatively monitored.
Among them there were six aldehydes (n-propanal, n-hexanal, n-heptanal, n-octanal, n-nonanal, and 2 methyl 2-propenal), four
ketones (acetone, 2-butanone, 3-buten-2-one, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one),
one hydrocarbon (2-methyl 2-pentene), and one terpene (DL-limonene).
The observed median emission rates ranged from 0.28 to 44.8 nmol ×
person–1 × min–1 (16–1530
fmol × cm–2 × min–1).
Within the compounds under study, ketones in general and acetone in
particular exhibited the highest abundances. The findings of this
study provide invaluable information about formation and evolution
of a human-specific chemical fingerprint, which could be used for
the early location of entrapped victims during urban search and rescue
operations (USaR).

==== Body
Hundreds
of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) are emitted through breath, urine, and skin emanations
by a human body.1,2 This specific chemical fingerprint
mirrors human physiology and can be used as a noninvasive biochemical
probe capable of tracing normal and disease processes occurring in
the organism, environmental exposure to pollutants and/or toxins,
or microorganisms’ activity.3 Recently,
an effort was made to employ this chemical signature for safety and
security applications. There is growing evidence provided by a number
of recent studies suggesting that the chemical analysis of human scent
could considerably improve the effectiveness of search and rescue
operations (USaR) organized after disasters entailing building collapses
(e.g., earthquakes, tropical storms, explosions).4 Although USaR teams increasingly rely on specialized technical
equipment supporting the rapid detection of trapped humans, trained
rescue dogs are still their preferred choice.5 Canines search rapidly and effectively disaster areas; however,
they are stress-prone and exhibit limited active time.6 Bearing in mind the recent high sequence of natural or
man-made disasters it is reasonable to assume that the demand for
novel human detectors will markedly increase in the nearest future.7

In our recent study, we identified and
quantified 33 volatile organic
compounds omnipresent in forearm skin emanations of healthy volunteers.8 However, the main goal of that study was the
reliable identification and detection of skin-borne species. To meet
the strict demands, forearm skin was used during experiments. Forearm
skin exhibits some differences as compared to the other parts of the
body that is reflected by the lower concentration of the sebaceous
glands and different composition of their secretion.9 Consequently, the emission rates of some volatiles presented
in our recent paper could differ from the ones typical for other parts
of the body. The main goal of the present study was the real-time
monitoring of the whole-skin emission of the selected potential markers
of human presence in conditions mimicking entrapment.

Proton-transfer
reaction mass spectrometry10 is a well-established
powerful tool in the analyst arsenal for detection
and quantification of volatile organic compounds in biological, medical,
and environmental studies.11−13 This position stems from its
versatility, excellent sensitivity (low ppt concentration levels),
and real-time response. Recent employing of a time-of-flight (TOF)
mass filter in the proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS)
instruments considerably increased their resolving power (up to 5000 m/Δm) and, thereby, the separation
and identification of isobaric compounds.14,15 Moreover, the analytical power of the PTR-TOF-MS can be further
enhanced by employing different precursor ions instead of H3O+ such as NO+, O2+,
or Kr+ (selective reagent ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (SRI-TOF-MS)).15,16 Such an approach can
help in many cases to separate functional isomers. Within the present
study, volatiles were quantified using the SRI-TOF-MS in conjunction
with NO+ as the reagent ion. The selection of this reactant
ion arose from two reasons. First, it provided the separation of aldehydes
from ketones (classes of compounds very well represented in skin emanations).8,17 Second, molecular ions of aldehydes produced in NO+ reactions
fragment considerably less than the ones produced when these species
are exposed to H3O+.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Calibration Mixtures
Single-compound
calibration mixtures were prepared from pure liquid substances. The
reference substances with purities ranging from 95 to 99.8% were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Austria) and Fluka (Switzerland).

The preparation
of gaseous calibration mixtures was described in detail in our recent
article.18 In brief, gaseous mixtures of
less volatile species were produced by means of a GasLab calibration
mixtures generator (Breitfuss Messtechnik, Germany). The generator
provides gas mixtures containing solutes at the concentration range
of low-ppb to 100 ppm at predefined humidity levels produced from
pure liquid substances and purified air. However, in this study, pure
substances were additionally diluted at ratios of 1:2000–1:3000
to reduce the resulting concentration levels. Effectively, gaseous
standards exhibiting four levels absolute humidity (1–3.53%)
with analytes volume fractions ranging from approximately 0.5 to 230
ppb were used during calibration and validation. Gaseous standards
of highly volatile compounds (e.g., 2-methyl-2-pentene) were prepared
by injecting and evaporating a few microliters of liquid analyte into
evacuated 1-L glass bulbs (Supelco, Canada). The desired calibration
levels were achieved by transferring appropriate volumes of the bulb
standard into Tedlar bags (SKC Inc.) filled with predefined amounts
of humidified zero air, the latter being produced by the GasLab generator.
Calibration curves were obtained on the basis of six distinct concentration
levels.

Human Subjects
A cohort of 10 healthy volunteers (7
males, 3 females, age range 23–56 years, median 30.5 years)
was involved in the study. All subjects gave written informed consent
to participate and completed a questionnaire describing their health,
smoking status, as well as the recent food intake. The sample collection
was approved by the Ethics Commission of Innsbruck Medical University.
The volunteers were asked to be in a fasting condition for 12 h before
the experiment to mimic the entrapment conditions. Apart from this
no special dietary regimes were applied. Volunteers were also asked
to refrain from the use of cosmetics, which could interfere with the
human scent and lead to the saturation of the detector.

Body Chamber
and Experiment Protocol
A bodyplethysmography
chamber BodyScope (Ganshorn Medicin Electronic GmbH, Germany) mimicking
the entrapment conditions was used during the experiments, as shown
in Figure 1. The cuboidal chamber is made up
of steel and glass and has internal dimensions of 82 cm × 63
cm × 161 cm (approximate volume 819 L). It was equipped with
a four-meter-long, heated (40 °C) Teflon transfer line (tube
i.d. = 3.188 mm (1/8 in.)) connecting the chamber with the SRI-TOF-MS
instrument. Since the highest level of the relative humidity of the
chamber air observed during experiments was 90% for 27.5 °C,
the transfer line temperature turned out to be sufficient to prevent
water condensation and thereby loses of well soluble VOCs during sampling.
The inlet of this sampling line was located in the center of the side
wall, and the volatiles of interest were sampled at a steady flow
rate of 50 ± 1 mL/min. It should be mentioned here that only
a part of this stream (approximately 10 mL/min) was introduced into
the drift tube of the SRI-TOF-MS instrument. When locked the chamber
was gastight; however, its interior was connected with the outside
air via an additional tube. Its task was to compensate the chamber
pressure during sampling and to prevent the air exchange with the
room air during the volunteer’s spontaneous breathing. At the
onset of an experiment, the chamber was filled with room air; however,
an effort was made to reduce the level of the indoor contaminants.
This was done by venting the laboratory room with outdoor air for
several hours. Moreover, both volunteers and laboratory staff were
asked to leave the room during this period. Prior to each experiment
involving a human subject, a background measurement was performed.
For this purpose the empty chamber was locked and the chamber air
was sampled for 30 min using the SRI-TOF-MS settings as described
below. Subsequently, the door was opened, the volunteer entered the
chamber, and the door was locked again. All volunteers remained inside
the chamber for 1 h in the sitting position. The duration of 1 h was
selected, since longer periods were considered as inconvenient by
the majority of subjects. The volunteers were dressed in underwear
to uncover as large area of the skin as possible. Since the study
was focused on skin-borne constituents of human scent it was necessary
to separate the skin emanation from breath. This was done by a silicone
head mask covering mouth and nose (V2Mask, Hans Rudolph Inc.) connected
to a two-way nonrebreathing Y shape-valve (Hans Rudolph Inc.). The
inlet and outlet of this valve were connected with flexible 22 mm
tubes (Flextube, Intersurgical Inc., U.K.) to the additional ports
located on the side wall of the chamber. Consequently, test subjects
could freely inhale and exhale the outside air without contaminating
the chamber air. After the volunteer had left the chamber, the door
remained open and the monitoring of VOCs was continued for an additional
15 min. In total, a single experiment lasted 105 min. The time resolution
of the measurements amounted to 30 s. This was a trade-off between
the method sensitivity and the requirement of the real-time analysis.
The temperature and humidity of the air in the chamber were continuously
monitored using a B+B TH 309 hygrometer (B+B Thermo-Technik GmbH,
Germany).

Figure 1 Experimental setup.

SRI-TOF-MS Analysis
VOCs were monitored using an Ionicon
Analytik (Innsbruck, Austria) type 8000 selective reagent ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometer operating with NO+ as
the reagent ion.19 The NO+ ions
were produced by supplying the hollow cathode with high purity dry
air. The ionization mechanism leading to the formation of NO+ ions is extensively described elsewhere.20,21 The settings of the ion source were chosen as follows: ion source
current 5 mA, source voltage (Us) 20 V, source out voltage (Uso) 70
V, and source valve 40%. With these settings the parasitic ions H3O+, O2+, and NO2+ were reduced down to the ratio (parasitic ion/NO+) of 0.3–0.6%, 1–1.5%, and 1–2%, respectively.
The ionization of the analytes contained in the sample gas fed-in
at ≈10 mL/min occurred in the drift tube at 2.23 mbar and 60
°C by means of the NO+ reagent ions extracted from
the ion source. Moreover, the drift voltage was set to 600 V leading
to an E/N ratio of approximately 130 Td.

The mass spectra ranging
from approximately m/z 2.76 to m/z 500 were acquired at a period of 30
s by coadding 750 000 single TOF-MS extractions of 40 μs
duration recorded at the sampling frequency 1/Δt = 10 GHz. The effective mass resolution obtained from the detected
peaks was ≈4000 at m/z 100.
The mass calibration was based on three peaks always present in the
spectra: H3O+ (19.0178), 15NO+ (30.9945), and NO2+ (45.9924).

Results
and Discussion
Ion Chemistry
The reactions of NO+ (IP,
9.26 eV) with volatile organic compounds are diverse and include charge
transfer, hydride ion (H–) transfer, hydroxide ion
(OH–) transfer, alkoxide ion (OR–) transfer, and NO+ ion–molecule association.15,20 Interestingly, different chemical classes of VOCs have their typical
reactions with NO+. For example, aldehydes react with NO+ via hydride ion transfer, ketones mainly via ion–molecule
association, and aromatic hydrocarbons via charge transfer.20 Unfortunately, in the PTR-MS instrument the
parent ions frequently fragment during collision with buffer gas molecules
producing unspecific secondary ions.22 Moreover,
the data on the fragmentation of volatile organic compounds in SRI-MS
are relatively sparse.22 Consequently,
one of the goals of this study was to determine the product ion distribution
of the analytes of interest reacting with NO+.

Table 1 summarizes the product ion distributions of species
under study in SRI-TOF-MS working in NO+ mode. Only the
ions with abundance greater than 0.5% of the total product ions signal
were considered. In accordance with earlier investigations, aldehydes
reacted with NO+ via hydride ion transfer forming M–H+ parent ions.23 All species from
this chemical family fragmented producing 2–6 additional hydrocarbon
ions. The most abundant products were formed at the m/z 71.0856 (C5H11+), 57.0699 (C4H9+), 43.0562 (C3H7+), or 41.0386 (C3H5+). Since they occur commonly in the spectra of
numerous species (not only aldehydes) they could not be used for the
identification and/or quantification of aldehydes under study. Interestingly,
heavier n-alkanals fragmented less than lighter members
of this chemical family. Consequently, the sensitivity for n-alkanals in SRI-TOF-MS (NO+) increases with
the increase of their molecular mass.

Acetone, 2-butanone, and 3-buten-2-one reacting with NO+ via ion–molecule association23 exhibited less fragmentation than the aldehydes being their functional
isomers. For these compounds the fraction of the NO+M ion
was greater than 60%. Conversely, the ion–molecule association
was not the basic ionization mechanism in the case of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one.
The NO+M channel was very weak (<0.5%) and additionally
evidenced the assumptions that the ionization energy (IE) of this
compound is lower than the one of NO+.24 Instead, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was ionized via charge
transfer. The resulting C8H14O+ ion
was further stabilized by ejection of H2O and CH3 (or C2H2) molecule. The other compounds 2-methyl-2-pentene
and DL-limonene reacted with NO+ via charge transfer; however,
they exhibited considerable fragmentation.

The presence of water
molecules in the sample had little or no
effect on the fragmentation of the molecular ions. However, several
product ions MH+ having proton affinities (PA) lower than
the one of water (691 kJ mol–1) reacted rapidly
with water molecules present in humid samples and thus were eliminated
from the reactor. In particular this concerned protonated acetylene
C2H3+ (PA = 641.4 kJ mol–1) and protonated ethylene C2H5+ (PA
= 680.5 kJ mol–1) appearing in the n-propanal product ion distribution. Moreover, the abundance of the
C3H5+ product ion was slightly reduced
in the spectra of 2-methyl 2-pentene, n-hexanal,
and n-heptanal obtained for humid air. Although the
difference between PAs of all possible structural isomers (allene,

of water should inhibit the proton transfer reaction, it could be
promoted by the elevated energies of the ion–molecule interactions

Limits of detection (LODs) were calculated using the
repeated analyses
of the blank and the calculation algorithm presented by Huber.25 More specifically, the standard deviation of
10 consecutive blank (obtained for the zero-air analysis) signals
and 1% probability (1 – α) for the type 1 error resulting
in the coverage factor of 2.96 were used for these purposes. The LODs
ranged from 0.12 ppb for 2-methyl 2-pentene to 1.2 ppb for 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one
(for a measurement time of 30 s). The limit of quantification (LOQ)
was defined as 3 × LOD. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) were
calculated on the basis of consecutive analyses of five standard mixtures
exhibiting concentrations spread around 10 ppb. The RSDs fall within
the range of 5.0–11% and were recognized as satisfactory for
the goals of this study. The instrument response was found to be linear
within the investigated concentration ranges, with coefficients of
variation ranging from 0.9918 to 0.9997.

Monitoring of Selected
Skin-Borne Volatiles
Within
this study emission of 12 skin-borne volatiles were monitored using
SRI-TOF-MS (NO+). Among them there were six aldehydes (n-propanal, n-hexanal, n-heptanal, n-octanal, n-nonanal,
and 2 methyl 2-propenal), four ketones (acetone, 2-butanone, 3-buten-2-one,
and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one), one hydrocarbon (2-methyl 2-pentene),
and one terpene (DL-limonene). These species were preselected from
the set of omnipresent human scent constituents identified and determined
in our recent study.8 Some compounds reported
in this reference could not be profiled due to the limitations of
the applied technique. This concerned species which could not be satisfactorily
separated or produced a weak signal. For example, the separation problem
concerned acetaldehyde and the acetone fragment at C2H3O+ or isomeric aldehydes (e.g., n-pentanal, 2-methyl-butanal, and 3-methyl-butanal). An exemplary
SRI-TOF-MS (NO+) spectrum from the skin emanation analysis
is presented in Figure 2. The initial chamber
air temperature was 23.4 ± 1 °C and tended to increase during
the volunteer’s stay in the chamber by 0.3–3.4 °C
(mean 1.9 °C). The relative humidity changed from the ambient
values (30–40%) to 70–90%.

analysis.

Exemplary concentration profiles
of acetone, n-propanal, n-nonanal, n-octanal,
DL-limonene, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one obtained for the applied
protocol are presented in Figure 3. For the
majority of species, the background levels were below 2 ppb. Only
acetone and n-propanal exhibited higher concentrations
at the onset of the experiments spreading around the median value
of 21 and 4 ppb, respectively. This background did not distort the
VOCs concentration profiles and was recognized as satisfactory for
the goals of the study. Once the volunteer was closed in the chamber,
the skin-borne VOCs accumulated, which was manifested by the increase
of their concentration in the chamber air. At the end of this phase,
the median absolute concentrations of species under study ranged from
3.5 ppb for DL-limonene to 90 ppb for acetone. The duration of the
experiment turned out to be too short to determine unambiguously the
characteristic of the VOCs liberation. It seems plausible that the
release of some VOCs stemming from the oxidative stress occurring
on the skin surface (e.g., aldehydes12,13,26) should be reduced shortly after the isolation of
the volunteer from the predominant factors inducing this condition
(O3, UV). Here, the concentrations tended to increase during
the whole second phase of the experiment and the saturation of the
concentrations was not observed. Presumably this effect could be noted
for the longer subjects’ presence in the chamber. Unfortunately,
the prolongation of the experiment time was recognized as oppressive
by the majority of the volunteers and could not be applied. Consequently,
for the investigated time period constant VOCs emissions were assumed.
For such an assumption the VOC emission rate is expressed by the slope
of the concentration profile recorded during the experiment phase
involving a human subject. The slopes, which were computed by fitting
the linear function to the corresponding concentration data together
with the volunteers’ characteristics and experiment conditions,
were used to calculate emission rates of analytes of interest. These
were expressed in nanomoles of analyte emitted by the person within
1 min of the experiment (nmol person–1 min–1) and alternatively in femtomoles released by one square centimeter
of skin within 1 min (fmol cm–2 min–1). In case of the latter, the volunteer’s skin area was estimated
using the formula given by Mosteller.27 The computed values are given in Table 3.

The presence of aldehydes
in human odor is related to the oxidation
of human sebum.12,28 This unique continuous layer
of lipids has photoprotective, antibacterial, and antimycotic properties
and is believed to be a natural antioxidant capable of neutralizing
reactive oxygen species (ROS).1,29 While exposed to ROSs,
sebum constituents degrade releasing a wide range of volatiles including
aldehydes. More specifically, aldehydes are produced from skin fatty
acids via β-scission of alkoxy radicals formed by the homolytic
cleavage of hydroperoxides.26 For example, n-octanal was reported to stem from oleic acid,13,26 whereas, n-hexanal was demonstrated to be formed
from linoleic, palmitoleic, and vaccenic acids.13,26 The median emission rates of the investigated aldehydes ranged from
29 fmol cm–2 min–1 for 2 methyl
2-propenal to 199 fmol cm–2 min–1 for n-propanal. These values are in a good agreement
with the emission rates noted for the forearm skin in our recent study
(see Table 3). Since the human sebum is thicker
on the skin covering central parts of the body (e.g., chest or forehead9) it is not surprising that the emission rates
recorded within this study reflect this uneven distribution and are
somewhat elevated. With the exception of n-propanal,
these differences amounted to 40–150%. Much more pronounced
discrepancy was observed for n-propanal. This may
result from the low number of volunteers affecting the statistics,
superposition of signals from other species at the m/z 57.0335, or both.

Four ketones were monitored
within this study: acetone, 2-butanone,
3-buten-2-one, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. The emission rate of acetone
was spread around the median value of 1530 fmol cm–2 min–1 and was at least 1 order of magnitude higher
than the emission rates of the remaining species. This is not surprising
as at least two productive sources of this compound can be indicated.
First, acetone is produced in large amounts endogenously in the liver
during spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate.30 Second, it is formed on human skin during induction by
reactive oxygen species degradation of squalene.12,13,31 Since squalene is the major component of
human sebum it seems plausible that the acetone emission reflects
this high abundance. The whole skin emission of acetone was approximately
50% higher than the emission from forearm skin (see Table 3) mirroring presumably the aforementioned sebum
distribution. Interestingly, the analogous differences for 2-butanone
and 3-buten-2-one were considerably higher. Apart from ketones, only
several classes of VOCs react with NO+ via ion–molecule
association. These include esters, carboxylic acids, and some hydrocarbons.20 However, the exact mass measurement of the respective
molecular ions excludes members of these chemical classes as potential
sources of the signal distortion. Conversely, the emission rate of
6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was 3-fold lower when measured for the whole
skin than for the limb skin. The reason of this discrepancy remains
unclear.

Conclusions
The present study aimed
at the monitoring of whole-skin emission
of selected potential markers of entrapped humans. For this purpose
selective reagent ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry operating
in NO+ mode and a bodyplethysmography chamber mimicking
the entrapment scene were applied. Overall profiles of 12 volatiles
were quantitatively monitored in skin emanation of 10 volunteers over
a time period of 1 h. The observed median emission rates ranged from
0.28 to 44.8 nmol person–1 min–1 for 2-methyl-2-pentene and acetone, respectively (or 16–1530
fmol cm–2 min–1) and were higher
than the emission rated observed for peripheral (forearm) skin.

The findings of this study provide quantitative information about
the formation of the human chemical fingerprint, which could be used
for early location of entrapped victims during USaR operations. The
understanding of the production and initial composition of this signature
is of particular importance for modeling of its behavior in the surroundings
of the entrapped person. Moreover, the concentration levels and physicochemical
characteristics of the potential markers of human presence determine
the selection of analytical instruments, which could be used for the
field detection of entombed victims. Such an on-site, real-time, and
hand-held instrumentation could considerably improve the effectiveness
of USaR operations. A number of recent studies suggest that some analytical
techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry (multicapillary column-ion
mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS), aspiration ion mobility spectrometry
(AIMS), field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS))
or sensor boards could meet this requirement and open a new promising
window in the USaR field operations toward the fast detection of entrapped
humans.
