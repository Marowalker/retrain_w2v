Envelope
protein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
armored with a dense glycan shield, which plays critical roles in
envelope folding, immune-evasion, infectivity, and immunogenicity.
Site-specific glycosylation profiling of recombinant gp120 is very
challenging. Therefore, glycoproteomic analysis of native viral gp120
is still formidable to date. This challenge promoted us to employ
a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer to identify low abundant glycopeptides
from virion-associated gp120. To search the HCD-MS data for glycopeptides,
a novel spectral-aligning strategy was developed. This strategy depends
on the observation that glycopeptides and the corresponding deglycosylated
peptides share very similar MS/MS pattern in terms of b- and y-ions
that do not contain the site of glycosylation. Moreover, glycopeptides
with an identical peptide backbone show nearly resembling spectra
regardless of the attached glycan structures. For the recombinant
gp120, this “copy–paste” spectral pattern of
glycopeptides facilitated identification of 2224 spectra using only
18 spectral templates, and after precursor mass correction, 1268 (57%)
spectra were assigned to 460 unique glycopeptides accommodating 19
N-linked and one O-linked glycosylation sites (glycosites). Strikingly,
we were able to observe five N- and one O-linked glycosites in native
gp120. We further revealed that except for Asn276 in the C2 region,
glycans were processed to contain both high mannose and hybrid/complex
glycans; an additional four N-linked glycosites were decorated with
high mannose type. Core 1 O-linked glycan Gal1GalNAc1 was seen for the O-linked glycosite at Thr499. This direct
observation of site-specific glycosylation of virion-derived gp120
has implications in HIV glycobiology and vaccine design.

==== Body
Protein glycosylation
functions
in protein solubility, stability, intracellular trafficking, cell–cell
adhesion, secretion, cell–cell signaling, and notoriously,
in the protective shield of viruses.1−5 Protein glycosylation enables attachment of different carbohydrate(s)
to proteins resulting in a dramatic increase of protein heterogeneity
and diversity.6 The linkage between carbohydrate(s)
and proteins defines the type of glycosylation, which can be mainly
N- or O-linked.6,7 N-linked glycosylation attaches
carbohydrate(s) to asparagine (Asn) residues in the consensus sequon
Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X ≠ Pro), whereas any threonine (Thr) or serine
(Ser) residues could be a potential site of O-linked glycosylation.6,8 On the basis of the glycan structures, N-linked glycans can be further
categorized into high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types.9

HIV envelope (Env) protein gp120, the viral
receptor designated
for initiation of HIV infection and immune evasion, is protected by
a glycan canopy.10 Both N- and O-linked
glycosylation are reported.11−13 Site-specific profiling of glycosylation
has been reported using recombinant gp120s.12,14 However, there would remain considerable challenges to profile site-specific
glycosylation for native gp120 derived from T-cell-expressed virions.
One of the main obstacles is the extremely low number of the molecules
(i.e., only 21–54 gp120 molecules per virion in contrast to
the approximately 1400 Gag molecules per virion).15−17

Mass
spectrometry (MS) is the tool of choice to profile protein
glycosylation in a site-specific manner.18 MS offers high sensitivity and selectivity, notwithstanding, it
is still quite challenging to analyze glycopeptides. In part, the
difficulty is introduced by the presence of a different glycan moiety
which distributes the otherwise same peptide to different glycopeptide
masses (dilution effect) and, even worse, greatly suppresses the signal
intensity of glycopeptides on the MS1 level, decreasing
the chance of MS/MS to occur for glycopeptide identification.19 Despite the intrinsic pitfalls associated with
detection of glycopeptides in the MS analysis, recent studies using
high energy C-trap disassociation (HCD)-MS have shown promise to reach
subfmol limit of detection.20 Other than
HCD fragmentation-type, collision-induced disassociation (CID), infrared
multiphotondissociation (IRMPD), electron capture dissociation (ECD),
and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) are also applied to study
glycopeptides.21−23 The use of multiple fragmentation methods provides
comprehensive and confirmatory identification of glycan and peptide
moieties of glycopeptides.22,24,25 The advantage of the sole use of the HCD is that it requires minimal
time for duty cycle compared to dual-scan (e.g., CID/ETD, HCD/ETD)
and favors more MS/MS scans toward extremely low abundant species.
The feasibility of using only HCD to study glycopeptides has been
established. Oxonium and peptide+HexNAc (Y1) ions have been used to
infer confident assignment and the microheterogeneity of each glycosylation
site.26 However, unequivocal identification
may be compromised using only oxonium and Y1 ions in a complex sample,
because peptide backbones of different glycopeptides can generate
the same mass even within a mass tolerance of 10 ppm.

Typical
HCD MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides consist of three components
for a search strategy. First, the oxonium ions are the robust markers
at low m/z region.27 Commonly seen oxonium ions are HexNAc at m/z 204.09 and HexHexNAc at m/z 366.14.27 Next comes the peptide
fragment b- and y-ions.20 HCD is one of
the fragmentation methods that can generate peptide fragment ions.21 Although these ions are less frequently detected
according to previous studies,20,22 it is the fingerprint
of the peptide backbone that infers the confidence of identification.28 The peptide moiety of a glycopeptide and the
peptide without attached glycan should, in theory, produce the same
experimental fragment ions because HCD is the fragmentation method
applied. The fragmentation pattern of the peptide moiety of the glycopeptide
could also be like that of the deglycosylated peptide, whose formerly
N-linked glycosylation site (N-glycosite) is deamidated from asparagine
to aspartic acid by Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGaseF) treatment.29 The final component is the peptide and peptide
+ glycan (Y−) ions that appear very frequently in the CID spectra
and less frequently in the HCD spectra of glycopeptides.22,30

To improve identification confidence for glycopeptides by
HCD exclusively,
we evaluated the use of b- and y-ions in MS/MS spectra of deglycosylated
peptides and glycopeptides. To do this, characterization of HCD fragmentation
of both N- and O-linked glycopeptides was studied and demonstrated
that peptide b- and y-ions which do not contain the site of glycosylation
are relatively consistent between the HCD glycopeptide fragmentation
spectrum and the deglycosylated (via PNGase F) form of the glycopeptide.
In addition, MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides with the same peptide
moiety are nearly identical regardless of concomitant glycan compositions.
This resulted in using a number of 18 spectral templates of glycopeptides
to assign 2224 MS/MS spectra to gp120 glycopeptides from which 460
unique glycopeptides were identified within a mass tolerance of 10
ppm. Finally, we observed that the peptide and Y-ions might be absent
in the MS/MS spectra of O-linked glycopeptides suggestive of the necessity
of using peptide b- and y-ions for identification of O-linked glycopeptides
by HCD. These key features were used to profile glycosylation of a
recombinant HIV gp120 HxBc2 strain expressed from 293 cells. Strikingly,
we were able to detect both N- and O-linked glycopeptides of native
gp120 from the T-cell-expressed HIV virion using spectral-aligning
strategy. The site-specific glycoform analysis has implications for
vaccine design and HIV glycobiology.

Materials and Methods
Materials
HIV envelope protein gp120 (HxBc2 strain,
clade B, GenBank No. K03455 and AAB50262.1, amino acid 34–518)
was purchased from Immune Technology Corp. (New York, NY). The protein
was expressed and purified from 293 cells. The HIV-1 latently infected
T cell line, ACH-2 cells, was obtained through the AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID. NIH: from Dr.
Thomas Folks.31−33 Microcon-50 kDa (50 kDa molecular weight cutoff)
and Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL-100 kDa (100 kDa molecular weight cutoff)
centrifugal filter units were from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Sequencing-grade
trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGase
F) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Sep-Pak C18
1 cm3 Vac Cartridge was from Waters (Milford, MA). Acetonitrile
(ACN), ammonium bicarbonate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), formic acid,
urea, tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), iodoacetamide, and phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO).

Expression and Purification of gp120 Derived
from T-Cell-Expressed
HIV Virion
The ACH-2 cell line is a subclone of the human
A3.01 T cell line derived from the acute infection with HIV-1. The
HIV DNA (GenBank: K02013.1) has integrated into the genome of the
T cell line. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
2 mm l-glutamine (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY),
100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone
Laboratories, Logan, UT). The cells were pelleted and washed in serum-free
medium for five times and resuspended in serum free medium to give
a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml prior to PMA induction
for 72 h. After the incubation, cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation
and medium was harvested and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter
unit, and the virus was concentrated by centrifugation through a 20%
sucrose cushion at 100 000g for 2 h at 4 °C.
The resultant pellets containing HIV virions were resuspended in PBS
buffer containing 1% NP40. The supernatant containing native gp120
(GenBank: AAB59751.1) was separated from insoluble particles by centrifugation
at 16 100g for 1 h at 4 °C. The sample
was then concentrated to 20 μL in 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate
buffer through an Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL-100 kDa filter unit.

Filter-Aided
Intact Peptide Preparation
Recombinant
and virion-derived gp120 (5 μg) were added to 8 M urea in 0.4
M ammonium bicarbonate buffer and reduced with 50 mM TCEP at room
temperature (RT) for 1 h. Proteins were alkylated by iodoacetamide
at a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated at RT in the dark
with shaking for 30 min. Samples were applied to the Microcon-50 kDa
centrifugal filter unit and centrifuged until the solution was minimal
in the filter unit. The samples were washed five times with 0.4 M
ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and 0.25 μg of trypsin was added
in the buffer after the final wash. The digestion was incubated in
30 °C for overnight. The tryptic peptides were harvested by centrifugation
for 30 min. The solution containing peptides and glycopeptides was
acidified to pH < 3, desalted by C18 cartridge according to manufacturer’s
instructions, dried in a speed-vac, and resuspended in 0.1% formic
acid.

Deglycosylation of gp120 HxBc2
Glycopeptides of gp120
HxBc2 (2 μg) were dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in PBS
buffer. The sample was then treated with 0.1 μg of PNGaseF for
24 h at 37 °C. The resultant deglycosylated peptides were acidified
to pH < 3 and desalted by C18 cartridge. Finally deglycosylated
peptides were dried in speed-vac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid.

LC-MS/MS Analysis
The samples (1 μg) were separated
through a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano system (Thermo Scientific)
with a 75 μm × 50 cm C18 PepMapRSLC separating column (Thermo
Scientific) protected by a 5 mm guarding column (Thermo Scientific).
Mobile phase flow rate was 0.35 μL/min with 0.1% formic acid
and 2% acetonitrile in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid 95% acetonitrile
(B). The gradient profile was set as following: 4–6% B for
9 min, 6–35% B for 83 min, 35–90% B for 5 min, 90% B
for 10 min and equilibrated in 4% B for 12 min. MS analysis was performed
using a Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The
spray voltage was set at 1.8 kV. Spectra (AGC target 1 × 106) were collected from 400 to 3000 m/z at a resolution of 140 K followed by data-dependent HCD
MS/MS (at a resolution of 17 500, NCE 28%, intensity threshold
of 4 × 104 and maximum IT 250 ms) of the 15 most abundant
ions using an isolation window of 4 m/z. Charge-state screening was enabled to reject unassigned, singly,
eight, and more than eight protonated ions. A dynamic exclusion time
of 25 s was used to discriminate against previously selected ions.

Peptide Identification
HIV gp120 peptides were identified
by using Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, version
1.4). The database used was recombinant gp120 HxBc2 strain or virion
gp120 proteins from LAV strain sequences in a NCBI RefSeq database
(downloaded from the NCBI Web site on August, 19, 2013, 53 738
entries). The precursor mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm and the MS/MS
tolerance at 0.06 Da. Parameters of the search were modified as follows:
oxidized methionines (add Met with 15.995 Da) and a (PNGase F-catalyzed)
conversion of Asn to Asp (add Asn with 0.984 Da) set as dynamic modifications
and Cys modification (add cysteine with 57 Da) set as a fixed modification.
A maximum of two missed tryptic cleavage sites were allowed. MaxQuant
version 1.3.0.5 with default setting was also used for database search
with default settings.34,35

Analysis of Intact Glycopeptide
MS Data
An in-house
software tool (manuscript in preparation) was developed to identify
the glycopeptides from MS and MS/MS data. The MS raw files were converted
to mzXML files by Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP). MatLab version R2013b
(MathWorks, Inc.) was then used to extract information from mzXML
files and code for the search strategy. The database was gp120 tryptic
peptides containing the site of glycosylation. The search strategy
is defined in the following steps: (1) identification of deglycosylated
peptides—the sequences and glycosylation sites were
identified from MS/MS analysis of PNGase F treated tryptic peptide
samples using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, version
1.4) of SEQUEST search; (2) detecting the b- and y-ions of
glycopeptides—sequences of deglycopeptide were used
to pick the b- and y-ions in charge states 1, 2, and 3 within a 20
ppm tolerance; (3) extraction of MS/MS spectra containing
glycopeptides—MS/MS spectra containing oxonium ions
from Hex, HexNAc, HexHexNAc, and NeuAc at m/z 163, 204, 366, 274, 292 were extracted as putative glycopeptide
spectra; (4) assigning glycopeptides—the putative
glycopeptide spectra were used to search for b- and y-ions detected
from deglycosylated peptides. The ratio of glycopeptide b- and y-ions
versus those detected from deglycosylated peptide was calculated.
To use the data for each glycopeptide backbone as putative glycopeptides,
the ratio above 20% for y+ ion was kept; (5) evaluate
the match of glycopeptides—to evaluate glycopeptides
matched to deglycosylated peptide sequences containing specific glycosylation
sites, the MS1 scan number, MS2 scan number,
precursor m/z, precursor charge
states, precursor mass, ratio and presence of b- and y-ions between
glycopeptides and deglycosylated peptides, other peptide b- and y-ions
detected in spectra of glycopeptides but not in deglycosylated peptides,
Δglycan mass, potential glycan composition consisting HexNAc,
Hexose, Fucose, and NeuAc, Y-ions in charge states 1, 2, and 3 were
extracted and computed in the program. These were considered to shortlist
the putative spectra for glycopeptides. The best-matched spectrum
for individual glycopeptide in different peptide backbones was manually
confirmed and used as spectral template to cross-match the putative
glycopeptide spectra using b-, y-, peptide, Y-ions, and software Xcalibur
version 2.2 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Platelet glycopeptides were
enriched by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)
and analyzed by the same algorithm to evaluate the false discovery
rate (FDR). Glycan stuctures reported previously34,35 and ExPASy tools GlycoMod, PeptideMass, and GlycanMass were used
to identify glycan compositions and glycan types.36,37 MS analysis infers the glycan compositions rather than actual glycan
structures, hence the glycan structures reported here were the representatives
of the glycans with the same composition. Xcalibur was used to inspect
the correct monoisotopic peak for glycopeptides on the MS1 level.

Results and Discussion
Strategy for Identification
of Glycopeptides
We exploited
the use of peptide b- and y-ions from deglycosylated peptides and
matched them to HCD MS/MS spectra containing oxonium ions to identify
glycopeptides. Next, the verified MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides were
used to cross-match all the other glycopeptides with the identical
peptide backbones but varying in glycoforms using b-, y-, and/or Y-ions.
The strategy was developed on the basis of the observation that the
presence of peptide b- and y-ions that do not contain a site of glycosylation
were relatively consistent between deglycosylated peptides and their
glycopeptides, and the MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides with the same
peptide backbones but different glycan moieties were nearly identical.
Moreover, Y-ions could be absent in the HCD MS/MS spectra of O-linked
glycopeptides, suggesting that the use of peptide b- and y-ions was
a critical consideration to identify glycopeptides in the HCD-MS.
Our search strategy included the following steps: (1) deglycosylated
peptides and glycosylation sites were identified from PNGaseF treated
sample; (2) b- and y-ions of peptide backbone were determined experimentally
using the deglycosylated peptide spectra; (3) MS/MS spectra containing
oxonium ions were extracted from the raw file of the sample without
PNGaseF treatment; (4) the b- and y-ions of the deglycosylated peptides
were used to match and filter the MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides;
(5) peptide and Y-ions in the MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides were
used to further evaluate the identification; (6) the best-matched
MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides were used to cross-match the other
MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides with the same peptide backbones; (7)
finally, the precursor m/z and the
Δmass between the peptide moieties and glycopeptides were used
to determine the glycoforms (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the HCD spectral-aligning strategy
for analysis of glycopeptides. Step 1, experimental b- and y-ions
of deglycosylated peptide backbones were recorded from sample treated
with PNGaseF. Step 2, these b- and y-ions of the deglycosylated peptides
were used to screen the MS/MS spectra containing oxonium ions from
the raw file for sample without PNGaseF treatment to identify putative
glycopeptides. The putative glycopeptides were further evaluated by
precursor ions, mass difference between glycopeptides and deglycosylated
peptides, and Y-ions in the MS/MS spectra of the glycopeptides. Step
3, the identified MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides were used as spectral
templates to identify other glycopeptides with the same peptide backbone
but in different glycoforms.

Determination of Experimental Fragment Ions of Deglycosylated
peptides for Identification of Glycopeptides
The strategy
described above was applied to the analysis of a recombinant gp120
for identification of glycoforms in a site-specific manner. The protein
has 24 known N-linked and one known O-linked glycosites (Figure S1).12 Among
these glycosites, 11 N-linked glycosites distributed in the variable
regions 1–5 (Figure S1) and the
other 13 N-linked glycosites resided in the conserved regions 1–5
(C1–C5) (Figure S1). The single
reported O-linked glycosite was located at amino acid position Thr499,
which was at the end of the C5 region (Figure
S1).12 MS/MS analysis of the gp120
protein with PNGaseF treatment identified 19 of the 24 known N-linked
glycosites with 1% FDR. Among the five undetected N-glycosites, one
glycosylation site, Asn230, is located in a short peptide backbone
CNN230K, and four other N-glycosites, Asn366, Asn392, Asn397,
and Asn406, are located in a long peptide. These five N-glycosites
are identifiable when a suitable length of deglycosylated peptides
is generated using alternative proteases.38 For the proof of principle study of our glycopeptide analysis strategy,
we focused on the identification of N-glycopeptides from the 19 N-glycosites
identified from deglycosylated peptides using trypsin digestion. The
b- and y-ions of the 19 deglycosylated peptides in charge states 1,
2, and 3 were recorded from MS/MS spectra on the basis of their scan
number and assigned peptide sequence. Notably, Asn instead of Asp
(deamidated asparagine introduced by PNGaseF treatment) in the Asn-X-Ser/Thr
sequon (X ≠ Pro) was used for the deglycosylated peptides.
This resulted in recording the b- and y-ions from peptide termini
to the amino acids prior to the formerly N-glycosylated Asp position,
beyond which the b- and y-ions in the MS/MS spectra had an additional
mass of 0.984 Da and were not recorded within the mass tolerance of
20 ppm. The rationale for this approach was that the b- and y-ions
after the glycosite were less likely to appear in the MS/MS spectra
of glycopeptides due to the effect of attached glycans, unless the
glycans were cleaved off by HCD fragmentation at the preferred glycosidic
bond which could occur in many cases.

Spectral Aligning of MS/MS
Spectra of N-Linked Glycopeptides
Next, 12 304 putative
glycopeptide spectra containing oxonium
ions were extracted from MS/MS spectra from analyzing sample without
PNGaseF treatment. The putative glycopeptide spectra were matched
to the recorded b- and y-ions from the deglycosylated peptides to
identify the peptide moieties of glycopeptides. The ratio of matched
b- and y-ions between glycopeptides and deglycosylated peptides was
calculated and filtered to generate a list of 9544 putative glycopeptide
spectra, as described in Materials and Methods. Each putative spectrum had an average of six putative peptide matches
and 921 putative spectra matched to one putative glycopeptide. The
spectrum of glycopeptide which scored the highest ratio of match was
verified by manual inspection through searching for additional b-
and y-ions, intensity of oxonium ions, and appearance of peptide and
Y-ions. These verified spectra of glycopeptides served as spectral
templates for the subsequent identification of other glycopeptides
harboring the same peptide backbone in the list of putative glycopeptide
spectra.

In the HCD MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides, because
most glycan structures are fragmented to oxonium ions during MS/MS,
the b-, y- and Y-ions appear to be nearly identical among glycopeptides
with the same peptide backbone regardless of attached glycan structures.
As illustrated, first the peptide b- and y-ions of deglycosylated
peptide SVD276FTDNAK were used to identify the glycopeptide
having the peptide backbone SVN276FTDNAK and glycan Man7GlcNAc2 (Figure 2A,B). Additional
glycopeptide with the same peptide backbone but different glycan,
Man5GlcNAc4, was then identified (Figure 2C). Specifically, in the comparison between the
MS/MS of the two glycopeptides (Figure 2B,C),
the three components, including (i) the oxonium ions at m/z 204, 366, (ii) y-ions at m/z 332 (y3+), 447 (y4+), 548 (y5+), 695 (y6+) from spectrum of deglycosylated peptide and extra b- and
y-ions at m/z 849 (b8+), 809 (y7+) from spectrum of glycopeptide,
and (iii) peptide ion at m/z 995
and Y-ions from peptide with cross-ring cleavage of GlcNAc at m/z 1079 to peptide with Man4GlcNAc2 at m/z 2049, were matched (Figure 2B,C). One of
the differences in these two MS/MS spectra was the detection of peptide
with Man5GlcNAc2 at m/z 2213 in the MS/MS spectrum of glycopeptide with Man7GlcNAc2, as well as the peptide with Man3GlcNAc3 at m/z 2091
and Man4GlcNAc3 at m/z 2252 in the MS/MS spectrum of glycopeptide with Man5GlcNAc4 (Figure 2B,C). These
differential Y-ions in different MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides could,
in part, facilitate the plausible assignment of the glycan composition.
Nevertheless, HCD fragmentation of glycopeptides have been shown to
improve the number and intensity of peptide b- and y-ions over those
observed in CID glycopeptide fragmentation spectra, which shows glycan
fragmentation predominantly.30 Therefore,
we were able to use b-, y-, and Y-ions to cross-match glycopeptides
as illustrated in Figure 2. Using b-, y-, peptide,
and/or Y-ions in the verified MS/MS spectral template of glycopeptides
to filter against the list of 9544 putative glycopeptide spectra,
we obtained 2620 MS/MS spectra for putative glycopeptides. Finally,
we manually verified a total number of 2119 MS/MS spectra of N-linked
glycopeptides of gp120. We tried to estimate tentative false discovery
rate (FDR) using a raw file analyzing platelet glycopeptides that
had 18 057 oxonium-ion-containing spectra. Use the same b-
and y-ions from gp120 deglycosylated peptides and filtering criteria,
81 spectra were matched to score a tentative FDR of 2.6%. Manual inspection
showed that those 81 MS/MS spectra were not similar to spectral templates
from recombinant gp120, suggesting that manual inspection was necessary
to remove the false-positives. Detail of the tentative FDR estimation
and discussion is described in Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Representative of MS/MS spectra for identification of N-linked
glycopeptides using HCD spectral-aligning strategy. (A) MS/MS spectrum
of deglycosylated peptide SVD276FTDNAK provided the
information on experimentally identified b- and y-ions. (B) MS/MS
spectrum of glycopeptide with matched pattern of b- and y-ions to
that of deglycosylated peptide was identified. Additional b-, y-,
and Y-ions facilitate identification of the glycopeptide SVN276FTDNAK with Man7GlcNAc2, which
was used as a spectral template to identify glycopeptides with the
same peptide backbone but different glycan Man5GlcNAc4 in (C).

Spectral-Aligning Strategy
for Identification of O-Linked Glycopeptides
O-linked glycopeptides
contain carbohydrate(s) attaching to Ser
or Thr, whose HCD MS/MS spectra could differ from that of its N-linked
counterparts. To evaluate the applicability of our strategy for identification
of O-linked glycopeptides, experimentally identified peptides IEPLGVAPT499K and IEPLGVAPT499KAK were used to generate theoretical
b- and y-ions. Again filtering the presence of peptide b- and y-ions
coupled with inspecting for peptide and Y-ions against 341 putative
glycopeptide spectra containing at least four y+-ions,
we identified O-linked glycopeptides with glycans, Gal1GalNAc1, and other O-linked glycopeptides, one of which
was with glycan NeuAc1Gal1GlcNAc1GalNAc1 (Figure 3).
In the MS/MS spectra of O-linked glycopeptides, the peptide b- and
y-ions were likely to appear because, possibly, the O-linked glycans
were easily cleaved off from the peptide moiety at the glycosidic
bond resulting in intensive fragmentation of the peptide backbone
(Figure 3). In addition, it was noticed that
peak intensity of Y1 and other Y-ions was lower to b- and y-ions and
could even be absent under the NCE we applied (Figure 3). These observations suggested that oxonium ion HexNAc at m/z 204 and peptide b- and y-ions were
highly relevant for identification of O-linked glycopeptides, and
the spectral-aligning strategy was applicable to O-linked glycopeptides.
Finally, a total number of 105 MS/MS spectra were identified from
O-linked glycopeptides bearing peptide backbones of either the IEPLGVAPT499KAK or the IEPLGVAPT499K. Using the same
criteria, only one putative O-linked glycopeptide was matched in the
platelet raw file scoring approximately 0.6% FDR, and this spectra
was dissimilar to its verified glycopeptides from recombinant gp120.

Determination of Glycoforms for Site-Specific
Profiling of gp120
Glycosylation
After matching glycopeptide spectra to specific
glycosylation sites, correct assignment of glycan composition for
each glycopeptide was an important step toward site-specific profiling
of protein glycosylation. Determination of the correct monoisotopic
peak was requisite for glycan assignment but error-prone due to the
relatively low abundance of glycopeptides, poor ionization efficiency,
and even more prominent, very frequent, intensity of the true 12C monoisotopic peak which was considerably lower than that
of 13C peaks (Figure S2). This
phenomenon could be used as an additional criterion to select and
verify the glycopeptides. However, this also resulted in selection
of the 13C peak during data-dependent acquisition of MS/MS
and reporting 13C peak as precursor m/z that added at least 1 Da ± 10 ppm to the monoisotopic
precursor mass (Figure S2). Without monoisotopic
mass correction, it could directly jeopardize the assignment of glycoforms.
Indeed, from a total number of 2224 MS/MS spectra with oxomium ions
and matched b- or y-ions for N- and O-linked glycopeptides of gp120,
only 387 MS/MS spectra (17% of total) were able to match with glycan
composition in mass tolerance of 20 ppm. We therefore used MaxQuant
to circumvent this issue and correct the precursor m/z for monoisotopic peaks. This step dramatically
improved the correct assignment of glycoforms that 1268 MS/MS spectra
(57% of total) were assigned within mass tolerance of 10 ppm. These
1268 spectra were corresponding to 460 unique glycopeptides (File
S1). These identified spectra were manually verified. Noticeably,
glycopeptides with more than one N-linked glycosylation sites could
also be assigned to the most likely combined glycoform. For instance,
TFN289GTGPCTN295VSTVQCTHGIRPVVSTQLLLN301GSLAEEEVVIR with likely glycan composition Hex17HexNAc4 was observed with five spectral counts
and in mass tolerance of 1 ppm (File S1). This was a unique feature for our search strategy that no glycan
database was required. Therefore, we were able to identify multiple
glycans on the glycopeptides containing sites of glycosylation.

N- and O-Linked Glycopeptides of gp120 from Virion
It is
formidable to identify very low abundant glycopeptides in a
complex sample. This difficulty was indeed the case for the Env protein
gp120 from virions. Here, we employed a Q-Exactive MS instrument,
which possesses a high tandem-mass-spectral acquisition speed for
an optimized HCD to detect gp120 glycopeptides from T-cell-derived
virion. Purification of native gp120 glycopeptides was described in Materials and Methods. MS and MaxQuant identified
both gag and gp120 proteins with an ID confidence ≥99% and
coverage of 44% and 17%, respectively. The gp120 from ACH-2 cell line
was from the LAV strain, which has a 96% identity (amino acid 34–518)
with HxBc2 strain determined by NCBI protein–protein BLAST
(Figure S3). Using our strategy, five N-linked
glycosites were identified from five glycopeptide backbones, that
is, GEIKN156CSFN160ISTSIR,
SAN276FTDNAK, AKWN339ATLK, WN339ATLK, and CSSSN448ITGLLLTR (Table 1). Of note, the only O-linked glycosite in peptide
backbone IEPLGVAPT499K was detected (Table 1 and Figure S4). The
ID confidence for native glycopeptides sharing the same peptide backbone
with recombinant gp120, first heavily relied on the peptide b- and
y-ions, was further supported by matching the MS/MS spectra to that
assignment from recombinant gp120 glycopeptides and peptides (Figure S4). The glycoform for the N-linked glycopeptides
was assigned to be predominant in high mannose in all four N-linked
glycosites and Gal1GalNAc1 for the O-linked
glycosite Thr499 (Table 1 and Figure S4). This observation strongly supported previous studies
showing relatively abundant oligomannose and presence of O-linked
glycosylation in Env protein gp120 from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) produced virion.11,12,39 Additional glycoforms of these glycopeptides were investigated at
the MS1 level, because glycopeptides with identical peptide
backbone but different glycoforms were thought to elute within a small
retention time window when C18 reversed-phase liquid chromatography
(RPLC) was used. The use of Xcalibur and manual inspection did not
seemingly reveal other glycoforms within mass tolerance of 20 ppm.
Collectively, we observed that Asn156 and 160 in the V1 V2 region
harbored the high mannose structure Man13–15GlcNAc4; Asn276 in C2 region possessed high mannose structure Man6–7GlcNAc2, hybrid/complex structure
Hex8HexNAc5, and Hex5HexNAc3. In addition, Asn339 in C3 region had high mannose structures Man8–9GlcNAc2, and Asn448 in C4 region had only
high mannose structure Man9GlcNAc2 (Table 1). The Gal1GalNAc1 appeared
to be the only glycoform detected for the O-linked glycosite (Table 1). This observation of N-linked glycopeptides from
virion suggested that glycans at Asn276 were likely to be hybrid/complex
glycans. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and structural studies
has indicated the presence of hybrid/complex glycan at Asn156 and
Man5GlcNAc2 glycan at Asn160 for recognition
by bnAbs PG9 and PG16 but direct detection of those glycans on native
gp120 lacked.9,40−42 Our data directly
support that glycans could be processed on native gp120 at these two
sites to have the possible glycan structures for bnAbs, but other
glycans most likely existed to cause possible reduction in optimal
neutralizing potency and complete neutralization. Glycans at Asn276
have been described as providing a protective shield for CD4 bind
site (CD4bs) and were targeted by bnAbs HJ16 and 8ANC195.43 The preferential glycan structure for these
two bnAbs has not been reported. In our data, the glycans at Asn276
could be relatively more flexible, and bnAbs might need special features
to gain adequate affinity to different glycans at this glycosite.
Glycans at Asn339 and Asn448 are targeted but not essential by 2G12,
which recognizes Manα1–2Man structure at the tip of glycans.44,45 Here, it appeared that glycans at these two sites were mainly Man8–9GlcNAc2, indicating their resistance to
glycosidase processing and explaining their supportive role for effective
binding by 2G12.39 Moreover, Asn448 has
been reported to be critical for efficient MHC class II-restricted
presentation of CD4 T cell epitopes and infectivity.46,47 In this regard, the exclusive Man9GlcNAc2 seen
at Asn448 implied that the glycan and glycosite might be essential
to maintain certain structural feature for infectivity. Overall, it
appeared that the glycopeptides from native gp120 presented in extremely
low abundance in our sample preparation. This low number precluded
the possibility to detect glycopeptides harboring other sites or low
abundant glycoforms on identified glycosites. An improved enrichment
step for virion gp120 and its glycopeptides would foreseeably improve
the detection of low abundant glycoforms.

S4).

Conclusion
We studied the HCD MS/MS spectra of N- and O-linked glycopeptides
and revealed spectral features that can be applied into a data-mining
strategy. The central discovery of the features is the “copy–paste”
spectral pattern of glycopeptides with identical peptide backbone
but different glycoforms. We also re-evaluated the use of peptide
b- and y-ions in identification of O-linked glycopeptides in an HCD-MS/MS
experiment. The result showed that although the intensity of peptide
b- and y-ions was lower than that of Y1-ions for N-linked glycopeptides,
they could be higher and became more relevant in identification of
O-linked glycopeptides. The b- and y-ions could be obtained by optimizing
the collisional energy.48 Using these spectral
features, a novel spectral-aligning strategy to search HCD-MS data
of both N- and O-linked glycopeptides has been developed. This data-mining
strategy used MS2–MS1, which differed
from a conventional MS1–MS2 search strategy.
In this way, glycopeptides with multiple glycans could be detected
for downstream verification using ETD-MS for example.

By applying
spectral-aligning strategy, site-specific profile of
recombinant gp120 glycosylation was achieved. More importantly, for
the first time, we have demonstrated the feasibility to detect both
N- and O-linked glycopeptides from virion gp120. Consistent with previous
studies, oligomannose structures were present in all N-linked glycosites.39 High mannose glycans at Asn156 and 160, Asn339
and Asn448 might be more resistant to glycosidase processing than
that at Asn276, supporting their roles in immune-evasion and infection
of HIV. Overall low abundant glycopeptides of gp120 limited our capability
to extract more information for site-specific assignment of virion
gp120. Our data has primed the technical path to profile glycosylation
of HIV native Env that would favor forthcoming studies of HIV glycobiology
and rational vaccine design.
