Mammalian cells release extracellular
vesicles (EVs) into their microenvironment that travel the entire
body along the stream of bodily fluids. EVs contain a wide range of
biomolecules. The transported cargo varies depending on the EV origin.
Knowledge of the origin and chemical composition of EVs can potentially
be used as a biomarker to detect, stage, and monitor diseases. In
this paper, we demonstrate the potential of EVs as a prostate cancer
biomarker. A Raman optical tweezer was employed to obtain Raman signatures
from four types of EV samples, which were red blood cell- and platelet-derived
EVs of healthy donors and the prostate cancer cell lines- (PC3 and
LNCaP) derived EVs. EVs’ Raman spectra could be clearly separated/classified
into distinct groups using principal component analysis (PCA) which
permits the discrimination of the investigated EV subtypes. These
findings may provide new methodology to detect and monitor early stage
cancer.

==== Body
Extracellular vesicles (EVs)1−3 are small spherical particles (diameter between 30 nm and 1 μm)
enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer, shed by living cells into their
extracellular environment.2 Both healthy
and unhealthy cells secrete EVs so that EVs are found in all body
fluids, such as blood plasma,4 urine,5 and breast milk.6 These
small particles play a significant role in both intercellular communication
and waste control.2,7

EVs are formed through several
biogenesis pathways, for example, the endolysosomal pathway or budding
from the plasma membrane.3 The vesicles
formation process allows the parent cells to package biomolecules
with the generated EVs, such as membrane lipids, proteins, receptors,
and genetic information.3 These biomolecules
are transported by the EVs from the parent cell to a recipient cell.2,4,8,9 The
molecular composition of the transported cargo has been shown to change
depending on the origin of the EVs. Therefore, EVs released from healthy
and diseased cells are likely to contain different combinations of
biological molecules. The different types of cargo in turn implies
that EVs can be utilized as a disease biomarker2,3 and
clinical relevance of EVs2,3 have been explored in
various studies.10

Recently it was
shown that EVs secreted by tumor cells contain tumor antigens.11,12 Various biochemical compositions of cancer derived EVs suggests
a potential of EVs as a biomarker not only for cancer diagnosis but
also for cancer prognosis and the monitoring of patients after or
during treatment.13 Furthermore, if the
alterations in EV molecular content can be reflected into an altered
spectral behavior, then spectroscopy could be used for the analysis.
Raman spectroscopy is an analytical tool long used to determine molecular
composition without external labels. Therefore, vibrational spectroscopic
technique presents a potentially useful opportunity for such an analysis.14−17

Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy is a type of vibrational spectroscopy
technique based on inelastic scattering by molecules. When incident
photons are scattered by molecules, some are scattered with particular
energy shifts, a phenomenon called Raman scattering.18 Raman microscopy is used to investigate structural and
compositional information on a specimen.18,19 Since the optical technique yields the fingerprint of chemicals,
it has been widely used in biological and pharmaceutical fields.10,20−22 It has been applied to identify differences in tissues
and cells. Convincing spectral differences have been demonstrated
between cancer cells and healthy cells, based on lipid droplet content,
carotenoids, and ratio between different proteins.14,21−25

Raman microscopy creates an image of the molecular composition
and structure of a sample.18−20 In Raman scattering, some of
the photons incident on a molecule are inelastically scattered, with
the energy change of the emitted photons related to the energy states
possible for the scattering molecule.18 Raman scattering does not require external labels and has been widely
used in the biological and pharmaceutical fields.10,20−22,26,27 Convincing spectral differences have been demonstrated between cancer
cells and healthy cells, based on lipid droplet content, carotenoids,
EVs, and ratio between different proteins.14,17,21−25

Therefore, Raman spectroscopy is a promising
tool to reveal the structural differences among EVs of various origins.
However, the vibrational differences across the EV subtypes is subtle.
Such subtle differences require sensitive and reliable analysis, such
as principal component analysis (PCA). This statistical technique
is used to interpret high dimensional data with several intercorrelated
variables.28 PCA is widely utilized in
pattern recognition, image processing, and spectroscopy. PCA differs
from supervised learning in the sense that all variation is evaluated
unsupervised so that dependence on peculiarities of the assignments
in the training set are avoided as all spectra are used without assignment

In this study, spontaneous Raman18 was
utilized to obtain spectral fingerprints of four different EVs subsets
that had been derived from two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and
PC3) and from platelet and red blood cells from healthy donors. We
obtained the spectral fingerprints of each EV subtype and used PCA
to identify the four vesicles subtypes based on 300 spectra. The discrimination
that we aim for is not between EVs from healthy prostate cells and
EVs from cancer prostate cells since this is not a discrimination
that would be useful in diagnosis (a healthy person lacks EVs from
cancers cells). Rather we seek to discriminate EVs from prostate cancer
cells from EVs derived from (healthy) platelets and red blood cells.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Blood Cells-Derived EVs
Red blood cell
concentrate (150 mL) obtained from Sanquin (Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
was diluted 1:1 with filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 154
mM NaCl, 1.24 mM Na2HPO4·2H2O, 0.2 mM NaH2PO4·2H2O, pH
7.4; supplemented with 0.32% trisodium-citrate; 0.22 mm filter (Merck
Chemicals BV, Darmstadt, Germany)) and centrifuged three times for
20 min at 1 560g, 20 °C using a Rotina
46RS centrifuge (Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany). The EV-containing
supernatant was pooled, and aliquots of 50 μL were frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Platelet concentrate
(100 mL) obtained from Sanquin (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was diluted
1:1 with filtered PBS. Next, 40 mL acid of citrate dextrose (ACD;
0.85 M trisodiumcitrate, 0.11 M d-glucose, and 0.071 M citric
acid) was added and the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 800g, 20 °C. Thereafter, the supernatant was centrifuged
(20 min at 1 560g, 20 °C). This centrifugation
procedure was repeated twice to ensure removal of platelets. The vesicle-containing
supernatant was pooled, and aliquots of 50 μL were frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Samples were thawed
on melting ice for 30 min before use.

Preparation of Prostate
Cancer-Derived EVs
Two prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and
LNCaP) were used as a model to produce prostate cancer-derived EVs.
Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium, RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, 11875) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine
serum, 10 units/mL penicillin, and 10 μg/mL streptomycin. Medium
was refreshed every second day. When cells reached 80–90% confluence,
they were washed three times with PBS and FBS-free RPMI medium supplemented
with 1 unit/mL penicillin and 1 μg/mL streptomycin was added
to the cells. After 48 h of cell culture, cell supernatant was collected
and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 min. The invisible
pellet containing dead or apoptotic cells and the biggest in size
population of EVs was discarded. The supernatant was pooled, and aliquots
of 50 μL were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80
°C. Size distribution and presence of the harvested EVs was assessed
with nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images were taken to provide some examples of EVs.

Size Distribution Measurement Using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
The concentration and size distribution of particles in the EV-containing
samples were measured by NTA (NS500; Nanosight, Amesbury, U.K.), equipped
with an EMCCD camera and a 405 nm diode laser. Silica beads (105 nm
diameter; Microspheres-Nanospheres, Cold Spring, NY) were used to
configure and calibrate the instrument. Fractions were diluted 10
to 2 000-fold in filtered PBS to reduce the number of particles
in the field of view below 200/image. Of each sample, 10 videos, each
of 30 s duration, were captured with the camera shutter set at 33.31
ms and the camera gain set at 400. All samples were analyzed using
the same threshold, which was calculated by custom-made software (MATLAB
v.7.9.0.529). Analysis was performed by the instrument software (NTA
2.3.0.15). Size distribution and concentration of EV samples are shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Concentration
and size distribution of EV samples measured using NTA. Panels A,
B, C, and D represent the NTA result of red blood cell-derived EVs,
platelet derived-EVs, PC3-derived EVs, and LNCaP derived-EVs, respectively.
The mean size of red blood cell derived EVs is 148 ± 3.7 nm,
and its concentration is 0.85 × 108 ± 0.03 × 108 particles/mL.
Platelet-derived EVs is 89 ± 4.6 nm and 0.42 × 108 ± 0.02 × 108 particles/mL. PC3-derived EVs
is 172 ± 3.7 nm and 1.00 × 108 ± 0.03 ×
108 particles/mL. LNCaP-derived EVs is 167 ± 4.4 nm
and 1.06 × 108 ± 0.05 × 108 particles/mL.

Visualizing Prepared Sample
Using Transmission Electron Microscopy
Size exclusion chromatography
was used to isolate EVs from the platelet and red blood cell EV-containing
samples.29 Sepharose CL-2B (30 mL, GE Healthcare;
Uppsala, Sweden) was washed with PBS containing 0.32% trisodiumcitrate
(pH 7.4, 0.22 mm filtered). Subsequently, a frit was placed at the
bottom of a 10 mL plastic syringe (Becton Dickinson (BD), San Jose,
CA)), and the syringe was stacked with 10 mL of washed sepharose CL-2B
to create a column with 1.6 cm in diameter and 6.2 cm in height. Platelet
or red blood cell EV-containing samples (125 μL) were loaded
on the respective column, followed by elution with PBS/0.32% citrate
(pH 7.4, 0.22 mm filtered). The first 1 mL was discarded and the following
500 μL was collected.

All EV samples were fixed 1:1 in
a 0.1% final concentration (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy
Science, Hatfield, PA) for 30 min. Then, a 300 mesh carbon-coated
Formvar film nickel grid (Electron Microscopy Science) was placed
on 10 μL of fixed sample for 7 min. Thereafter, the grid was
transferred onto drops of 1.75% uranyl acetate (w/v) for negative
staining, blotted after 7 min and air-dried. Each grid was studied
through a transmission electron microscope (Fei, Tecnai-12; Eindhoven,
The Netherlands) operated at 100 kV using a Veleta 2,048 × 2,048
side-mounted CCD camera and Imaging Solutions software (Olympus, Shinjuku,
Tokyo, Japan). All steps were performed at room temperature and all
used liquids were filtered through 0.22 μm filters (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany). TEM images of the various groups of EV are shown in Figure 2.

Raman Spectral Data Acquisition
For the Raman experiments, a 50 μL volume of each EV sample
was placed in a hollow cavity on a microscope slide which is made
with borosilicate glass. The cavity was covered by a thin glass disk
(0.25 μm, borosilicate glass to prevent evaporation and contamination.

To obtain the spectral information on EVs, a custom-built Raman
microscope was used. This microscope has a Kr+ laser (Innova
90-K, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with a wavelength of 647 nm
as the excitation source. The excitation beam was focused onto the
prepared sample. The scattered photons were collected by the same
objective lens (40×/0.95NA UPLSAPO, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan),
focused on a 15 μm pinhole at the entrance of custom-made spectrograph
dispersing in the range of 646–849 nm.30 The pinhole allows us to achieve confocal configuration with lateral
laser spot size of about 350 nm and axial resolution of about 1.5
μm. The spectral data were dispersed by a prism based custom
built spectrograph and recorded by an EMCCD camera which was cooled
down to −70 °C (Newton DU-970N-BV, Andor Technology Ltd.,
Belfast, Northern Ireland).30

EVs
are very small and float in suspension. Optical trapping allows the
capturing of vesicles at the waist of the highly focused beam.10,31 We focused the excitation beam 50 μm below the bottom of the
disk coverslip to minimize artifacts from the surroundings. The power
of the excitation beam was 50 mW under the objective. The exposure
time per spectrum was 10 and 16 spectra were obtained at the fixed
position (160 s in total). After each data acquisition, we closed
the shutter of the laser and moved the sample stage to allow new vesicles
to be captured. Uniform experimental conditions were applied during
all the experiments. We obtained 300 data sets from four different
EV subtypes (75 data sets from each subtype).

Data Processing and Principal
Component Analysis
All programs were implemented in MATLAB
R2016b (version 9.1.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Cosmic rays and
the background from the microscope system were corrected. The raw
Raman signal was recorded as a function of the pixel number. Pixel
numbers were converted into the wavenumber scale using toluene peaks
and ArHg lines (520, 785, 1003, 1030, 1210, 1604, 2919, 3056, 1097,
1303, 1705, 1910, 2126, 2145, 2357, 2508, 2873, 2964, 2977, 3114,
3131, 3354, 3560, and 3582 cm–1) for calibration.

Since the volume of EVs are about 100 folds smaller than confocal
volume, the contribution of the vesicles to the total signal was much
weaker than the background from the suspension (PBS or RPMI-1640 cell
culture medium). To retrieve the contribution of EVs, we obtained
the spectral information from pure PBS and cell culture medium and
subtracted this from the collected spectral data of the EV samples.
To reduce the noise, we averaged 16 spectra in a data set. Nevertheless,
the processed data still contained several sources of noise, such
as the offset, bending, and autofluorescence contributions. We applied
baseline correction using the msbackadj with default value which is
a function of the Bioinformatics Toolbox of MATLAB (see Figure 3).

Figure 3 Raman spectra of each

Raman data and curves in the right column shows preprocessed data.
For the data processing, background subtraction and baseline correction
were conducted. (A and E) Spectrum of red blood cell-derived EVs,
(B and F) spectrum of platelet-derived EVs, (C and G) spectrum of
PC3-derived EVs, and (D and H) spectrum of LNCaP-derived EVs.

For the multivariate analysis,
we selected the spectral fingerprint region of each EV subtype which
is the range of 400–1800 cm–1. The preprocessed
spectra were normalized using unity-based normalization (feature scaling)
for PCA. This brings all values into the range of 0 to 1, which prevents
the emergence of artifacts as a result of variations in the intensity.
PCA was performed with the function in MATLAB.

Results and Discussion
Figure 4 shows the
averaged Raman spectra of EV subtypes in 400–1800 (left, fingerprint
region) and 2700–3050 cm–1 (right, high-frequency
region) after baseline correction and normalization. Data preprocessing
was required due to the weak Raman contribution of EVs. Spectral features
were observed in both the fingerprint and the high frequency region. Figure 4 shows the spectral
differences across the EV subtypes (670–770, 998, 1146–1380,
1504–1590, and 1710–1780 cm–1 in the
fingerprint; 2834–2897 and 1985–3025 cm–1 in the high-frequency region). Each EV subtype showed distinctive
spectral features; for example, lipid contents at 2847 and 2876 cm–1, protein contribution at 2932 cm–1, CH2 deformation in lipids at 1296 cm–1, CH2 and CH3 deformation in proteins and lipids
at 1440 cm–1, phenylalanine at 1603 cm–1, amide II at 1544 cm–1 and C=C stretching
in lipids 1650 cm–1.32−34

Figure 4 Raman spectra of EV subtypes.
The curves are normalized using feature scaling method to enable comparison
of the spectra in same scale. Each EV fingerprint shows spectral differences
across the fingerprint area. Shaded area shows the main contribution
to the separation by PCA. The spectra are vertically segregated for
clarity purpose. High-frequency region (right) also shows small discrepancies
between EV subtypes.

Multivariate analysis using PCA was conducted on the Raman
spectra of four different EV subtypes (red blood cell-, platelet-,
PC3-, and LNCaP-derived EVs). The Raman spectra in the range of 400
to 1800 cm–1 with a 2 cm–1 interval
(n = 300; 654 data points) were selected for PCA.
We also performed PCA in the high frequency region (2700 to 3050 cm–1) and full spectra (400 to 3050 cm–1), but these resulted in a weak separation (see Figure 5D–I). PCA in the fingerprint
region performed better. The PCA score plot of PComp1 (87.47% of data
variance) vs PComp2 (5.27% of data variance), PComp3 (1.36% of data
variance) vs PComp1, and PComp3 vs PComp2 are shown in parts A, B,
and C of Figure 5,
respectively. Hematopoietic cell-derived EVs are marked with circles
and cancer-derived EVs with triangles. In Figure 5B,C, PCA score plots clearly separate the
prostate cancer EV group from the healthy EV group with 94.67% and
98%, respectively, of the data being accurately classified. This result
indicates the clear discrimination of these two groups based on their
spectral fingerprints. PCA loading plots show that those classification
might be contributed by a peak at 750 cm–1 (latic
acid) and a spectral band between 1500 and 1700 cm–1, which contains contribution of phenylalanine at 1603 cm–1 and amide II at 1544 cm–1 (see Figure 6).

Raman spectra obtained from four EV subtypes (red blood cell-EVs,
blue ●; platelet-EVs, green ●; PC3-EVs, red ▲

EVs and triangles show cancer-derived EVs. Panels A–C were
performed on the fingerprint region (400–1800 cm–1), panels D–F were performed on the high-frequency region
(2700–3050 cm–1), and panels G–I were
performed on the full spectrum (400–3050 cm–1). Panels B and C show good separation among EVs with various cellular
origins. Principal component 1 (PComp1), PComp2, and PComp3 account
for 87.47%, 5.27%, and 1.36% of total variance, respectively. (A)

and (C) score plot for PComp2 and PComp3. In panels B and C, 94.67%
and 98% of the data is classified into two categories, respectively,
one containing the healthy cell-derived EVs and the other one the
prostate cancer-derived EVs.

However, some EVs were not well
separated. This could be caused by the heterogeneous nature of cancer
EVs and the low signal-to-noise ratio of EV spectra. Despite these
limitations, the result of multivariate analysis suggests the need
for further study on EVs detection and recognition for disease monitoring.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have explored spectral differences between cancer-derived
EVs and healthy control-derived EVs to examine the potential of cancer-derived
EVs as a cancer biomarker. To clarify the role of EVs as a disease
biomarker, Raman spectroscopy was employed to obtain the spectral
fingerprint of EV subtypes. We obtained 300 data sets from four EV
subtypes, and Raman spectra of EVs were analyzed with PCA to classify
vesicle subtypes. Based on principal component of the spectral information,
the result of multivariate analysis shows the spectral differences
between healthy cells derived EVs (red blood cell and platelet) and
prostate cancer cell-derived EVs (PC3 and LNCaP). The PC score plot
shows that more than 90% of EVs were classified into two categories.
This result suggests the potential of EVs as a cancer biomarker and
makes them worthy for further investigation.
