Traditionally, the d-amino
acid containing peptide (DAACP) candidate can be discovered by observing
the differences of biological activity and chromatographic retention
time between the synthetic peptides and naturally occurring peptides.
However, it is difficult to determine the exact position of d-amino acid in the DAACP candidates. Herein, we developed a novel
site-specific strategy to rapidly and precisely localize d-amino acids in peptides by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) analysis
of mass spectrometry (MS)-generated epimeric fragment ions. Briefly,
the d/l-peptide epimers were separated by online
reversed-phase liquid chromatography and fragmented by collision-induced
dissociation (CID), followed by IMS analysis. The epimeric fragment
ions resulting from d/l-peptide epimers exhibit
conformational differences, thus showing different mobilities in IMS.
The arrival time shift between the epimeric fragment ions was used
as criteria to localize the d-amino acid substitution. The
utility of this strategy was demonstrated by analysis of peptide epimers
with different molecular sizes, [d-Trp]-melanocyte-stimulating
hormone, [d-Ala]-deltorphin, [d-Phe]-achatin-I,
and their counterparts that contain all-l amino acids. Furthermore,
the crustacean hyperglycemia hormones (CHHs, 8.5 kDa) were isolated
from the American lobster Homarus americanus and identified by integration of MS-based bottom-up and top-down
sequencing approaches. The
IMS data acquired using our novel site-specific strategy localized
the site of isomerization of l- to d-Phe at the
third residue of the CHHs from the N-terminus. Collectively, this
study demonstrates a new method for discovery of DAACPs using IMS
technique with the ability to localize d-amino acid residues.

==== Body
The isomerization
of an l- to d-amino acid is a remarkable post-translational
modification of peptides in RNA-based protein synthesis and has been
documented in amphibians, invertebrates, and mammals.1−4 In many cases, the d-amino acid containing peptides (DAACPs)
exhibit dramatically higher affinity and selectivity for receptor
binding than their all-l counterparts and thus are essential
for biological function.4 Generally, the
targeted approaches for discovery of endogenous DAACPs include two
steps: screening DAACP candidates in biological samples and then localizing d-amino acid residues.2,5 Many new DAACPs were
found by observing the differences in biological activity or chromatographic
retention time between synthetic peptides and naturally occurring
peptides.2−5 In addition, immunoassays based on conformational antibodies have
been successfully used to screen DAACPs at the tissue and cellular
level.2,6 For localization of d-amino acids
in DAACP candidates, the most popular approach relies on matching
chromatographic retention time of the naturally occurring peptide
with a panel of synthetic peptides.2 For
example, validation of a deca-DAACP presumably requires testing 10
synthetic peptides, each of which contains a d-amino acid
at a varied position, leading to high cost and limited analytical
throughput. Other techniques utilize Edman degradation7 or acid hydrolysis2,8 to release free amino
acids, followed by chromatographic analysis of the free or derivatized
amino acids. However, cleavage of amide bond by chemical methods induces
a 3–15% level of racemization.9 Therefore,
there is a great demand for development of a simple and low-cost method
to localize d-amino acids in a wide range of DAACP candidates.

In the past decade, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a powerful
tool for peptidomics studies. However, differentiation of d/l-peptide epimers by MS represents a major analytical challenge
because the peptide epimers share identical masses and primary structures.10 Consequently, l- to d-amino
acid isomerization has been largely overlooked in MS-based peptide
discovery. Recently, a variety of fragmentation techniques in tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS), such as collision-induced dissociation
(CID),9,11,12 metastable
decomposition,12 electron capture dissociation,9,13 and radical-directed dissociation,14 have
been successfully applied in discriminating d/l-peptide
epimers through the comparison of fragment ion intensities. Although
excellent differentiation and quantitation between d/l-peptide epimers can be accomplished by these strategies, localization
of d-amino acid in peptides is still difficult, as measurement
of fragment ion intensities cannot provide accurate positional information
of d-amino acids. To address this problem, this study introduces
a novel ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry (IMS–MS)-based
strategy enabling site-specific characterization of DAACP epimers
to localize d-amino acids.

The IMS–MS technique
has been widely used to probe the gas-phase conformations of biomolecules
by measuring their mobility in a buffer gas15,16 and has shown very broad applicability in the separation and identification
of isomeric peptides.16,17 Previous studies reported that
intact d/l-peptide epimers displayed different mobility
in IMS due to conformational differences attributed by substitution
of an l- to d-amino acid.18 Presumably, under CID fragmentation the two peptide epimers may
produce epimeric fragment ions which contain the same amino acid sequences
but differ by substitution of an l- to d-amino acid.
This raises a question of whether the epimeric fragment ions derived
from d/l-peptide epimers exhibit different mobility
in IMS due to conformational differences, and whether or not those
differences enable d-amino acid localization. For example,
the peptide epimers PEPdTIDE and PEPlTIDE may respectively produce the epimeric y6 ions,
EPdTIDE+ and EPlTIDE+, which show different mobility in IMS analysis due
to substitution of d/l-Thr. In contrast, the y3 ions IDE+ derived from the two peptide epimers
contain the same all-l amino acid residues and thus exhibit
the same mobility. Therefore, sequential mobility analysis of epimeric
fragment ions may be able to accurately identify d-amino
acids in DAACP candidates. On the basis of this concept, we developed
a novel liquid chromatography (LC)–MS/MS–IMS strategy
which allows site-specific characterization of peptide epimers. The
practical utility was demonstrated by analysis of peptide standards,
[d-Trp]-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), [d-Ala]-deltorphin (DTP), [d-Phe]-achatin-I, and their all-l forms. The strategy was then applied to determine the isomerization
of an l- to d-Phe in crustacean hyperglycemia hormones
(CHHs) isolated from the sinus gland of American lobster, Homarus americanus.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Methanol, glacial acetic acid, borane pyridine, and formaldehyde
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Optima grade formic
acid, acetonitrile (ACN), water, and methanol were purchased from
Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Peptide standards, [d-Trp]-MSH and its all-l form were purchased from American
Peptide Company; and [d-Ala]-deltorphin and [d-Phe]-achatin-I
as well as their all-l forms were synthesized in Biotechnology
Center, University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Animals, Tissue
Dissection, and Extraction
American lobster H. americanus were purchased from Maine Lobster Direct
Web site (http://www.mainelobsterdirect.com). All animals
were kept in a circulating artificial seawater tank at 10–15
°C. Tissue dissection and extraction was performed according
to our previous reports.19,20 Briefly, animals were
anesthetized in ice, and the sinus glands were dissected and collected
in chilled acidified methanol and stored in −80 °C freezer
prior to further sample processing. The tissues were homogenized and
extracted with 100 μL of acidified methanol (methanol/H2O/acetic acid, 90:9:1, v/v/v) for three times.

LC–MS/MS
Coupled to Ion Mobility Spectrometry
The LC–MS/MS–IMS
experiments were performed on a Waters nanoAcquity ultraperformance
LC system coupled to a Synapt G2 high-definition mass spectrometer.
Chromatographic separations were performed on a Waters BEH 300 Å
C18 reversed-phase capillary column (150 mm × 75 μm, 1.7
μm). The mobile phases used were 0.1% formic acid in water (A)
and 0.1% formic acid in ACN (B). The peptide sample was injected and
loaded onto the Waters Symmetry C18 trap column (180 μm ×
20 mm, 5 μm) using 97% mobile phase A and 3% mobile phase B
at a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 3 min. The gradient started from
3% to 10% B during the first 5 min, increased to 45% B in the next
65 min, then was kept at 90% B for 20 min. A fixed MS/MS survey was
employed to select the peptide molecular ions in a traveling-wave
(T-Wave) trap cell for CID fragmentation with adjusted collision energy
of 22–30 eV. The resulting fragment ions were online submitted
to T-Wave drift tube and time-of-flight analyzer to measure the arrival
time. Instrument acquisition parameters used were as follows: an inlet
capillary voltage of 2.8 kV, a sampling cone setting of 35 V, and
a source temperature of 70 °C. The argon gas pressures in the
traveling wave ion guide trap and the traveling wave ion guide transfer
cell were 2.44 × 10–2 and 2.61 × 10–2 mbar, respectively. The wave height, the wave velocity,
and the nitrogen pressure in the traveling wave IM drift cell were
32.0 V, 800 m/s, and 2.96 mbar, respectively.

Data processing
was conducted using Waters MassLynx 4.1 and DriftScope 2.1. The LC–MS/MS–IMS
.raw data was opened in DriftScope, and the Selection Tool is used
to respectively select the two peptide epimer LC peaks and export
the two corresponding Masslynx .raw data by retaining arrival time
functions. The arrival time distributions of interested ions were
exported from Masslynx.

Calibration of Collision Cross Sections on
Ion Mobility Spectrometry
The T-Wave N2 drift
tube of Synapt G2 was calibrated for collision cross section (CCS)
measurements using a slightly modified version of the polyalanine
method outlined by Bush et al.21 and the
calculation method by Ruotolo et al.22 A
100 μg mL–1 solution (49:49:2, water/acetonitrile/acetic
acid) of polyalanine was directly infused and acquired with the same
instrument and method settings used to acquire the DAACP analyte.
A peak list containing m/z-corrected
mobility and arrival times was then exported from DriftScope to a
csv for CCS calculation. Further details of the CCS calculation and
a representative calibration curve can be found in the Supporting Information. It should be noted that
this method allows measurement of CCSHe in spite of using
nitrogen as drift gas in our experiment.21 Thus, the CCSs shown in this paper correspond to the helium drift
gas.

Tryptic Digestion and Bottom-Up Sequencing of CHHs on Synapt
G2 HDMS
For trypsin digestion of CHHs, 1 μL of tissue
extract was reduced and alkylated by incubation in 2.5 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation in 7 mM iodoacetamide
(IAA) in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, and then digested at
37 °C overnight after addition of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
buffer with 0.5 μg of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The tryptic
digest was injected into a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system coupled
to a Synapt G2 HDMS. Chromatographic conditions are the same as described
above. A data-dependent acquisition was employed for the MS survey
scan and the selection of three precursor ions and subsequent MS/MS
of the selected parent ions. The MS scan range was from m/z 400–2000, and the MS/MS scan was from m/z 50–2000.

Top-Down MS/MS Fragmentation
of CHHs on Q Exactive
A 1 μL of crude tissue extract
was reduced by incubation in 2.5 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 °C and
desalted by C18 ZipTip and resuspended in 10 μL of water containing
0.2% formic acid. Online top-down MS was carried out on Waters nanoAcquity
ultraperformance LC system coupled to a Q Exactive quadrupole Orbitrap
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The
peptide sample was injected and loaded onto the Waters Symmetry C18
trap column (180 μm × 20 mm, 5 μm) using 97% mobile
phase A and 3% mobile phase B at a flow rate of 5 μL/min for
3 min. A Waters BEH 300 Å C18 reversed-phase capillary column
(150 mm × 75 μm, 1.7 μm) was used for separation.
The gradient started from 3% to 10% B during the first 5 min, increased
to 55% B in the next 65 min, then was kept at 90% B for 20 min. Typical
mass spectrometric conditions were as follows: spray voltage, 2.8
kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; heated capillary temperature,
275 °C; normalized HCD collision energy 30%. The Q Exactive instrument
was operated in targeted MS/MS mode with an inclusion list containing
the targeted mass of the CHHs. The settings are as follows: resolution
70 000; automatic gain control 2 × 105; maximum
ion injection time, 100 ms; isolation window, 6 m/z; fixed first mass, 100 m/z. All MS/MS spectra were processed with Xtract CI-3.0 Software
(Thermo Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany) using an S/N threshold of
1.5 and fit factor of 40% and validated manually. The resulting mass
lists were further assigned using the in-house developed “Ion
Assignment” software with of 10 ppm of mass error tolerance.
The assigned ions were manually validated to ensure the quality of
assignments.

Results and Discussion
Workflow and Rationale
of the Proposed Site-Specific Strategy for Localization of d-Amino Acids in Peptide Epimers
Figure 1 illustrates the workflow for the proposed strategy. The analysis
can be completed in a single LC–MS/MS–IMS run. The peptide
epimers are separated by reversed-phase LC (RPLC) and online-submitted
to CID fragmentation. The resulting peptide fragment ions are then
subjected to IMS for measurement of arrival time. The epimeric ions
of y6, y5, and y4 derived from the
two peptide epimers respectively contain the l- or d-Thr, which possibly leads to conformational differences between
each epimeric y ion pair, resulting in arrival time shift during IMS
analysis. In contrast, the two peptide epimers produce the same y3, y2, and y1 ions containing all-l amino acids, due to the absence of the d- or l-Thr from the peptide chain by CID fragmentation. Thus, these
y ion pairs display identical arrival times. By determining at which
residue the arrival time shift starts to occur, the d-amino
acid can be confidently localized at the threonine. Sometimes, an
LC–MS–IMS run without fragmentation is needed to measure
the arrival times of peptide molecular ions when the d-amino
acid is at the N-terminus. To validate the proposed strategy, we analyzed
three pairs of peptide epimers with various molecular sizes: [d-Trp]-MSH (MW 1569.73 Da), [d-Ala]-DTP (768.38 Da),
[d-Phe]-achatin-I (407.18 Da), and their counterparts with
all-l amino acids.

Figure 1 Workflow of the proposed strategy for localization
of d-amino acids in peptides. The analysis can be performed
in a single LC–MS/MS–IMS run. The two peptide epimers
are separated by RPLC and respectively fragmented by CID. Their fragment
ions are then submitted to IMS for arrival time measurement. By comparing
the arrival time distributions between the two sets of fragment ions,
the position of d-amino acid can be determined: √,
arrival time shift; ×, no shift. For illustration purpose, only
y ions are listed in this workflow. Note that other fragment ions
can also be used as indicators for localization of d-amino
acids.

Site-Specific Characterization
of MSH Peptide Epimers for Localization of d-Amino Acids
The MSHs are produced by cells in the intermediate lobe of the
pituitary gland, which stimulates the production and release of melanin,
and have effects on appetite and sexual arousal.23 It was reported that the d-Trp-substituted isoform
was the most selective analogue for the melanocortin receptors.23 In our study, the peptide epimers d/l-MSH (YVMGHFRdWDRFG and YVMGHFRWDRFG,
1:1, concentration ratio) were analyzed by LC–MS–IMS
on a Waters Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer coupled to a nanoACQUITY
UPLC system. Figure 2A shows the extracted
ion chromatogram of the two peptides with RPLC baseline separation.
The [M + 3H]3+ ions of the two epimers exhibit different
arrival times at 2.32 and 2.39 ms, respectively (Figure 2, parts B and C). Subsequently, the peptide mixture was analyzed
by LC–MS/MS–IMS, where the two peptide epimers were
fragmented by CID and then the resulting fragment ions were submitted
to IMS for arrival time measurement. In their CID spectra (Supporting Information Figure S-1), a set of
y ions, y3–y11 are observed, and the
corresponding arrival time distributions are illustrated in Figure 3D. The d/l-epimeric ions of y5, y6,
y9, and y11 exhibit arrival time shifts, whereas
the paired y ions of y3 and y4 derived from
the two peptide epimers have the identical arrival time distributions.
More importantly, the arrival time shift between the epimeric y ions
starts from y5, which is the first y ion that contains
tryptophan by counting from y3 to y11. The results
indicate that the d-amino acid is localized at the tryptophan
(YVMGHFRdWDRFG) as annotated in Figure 2E. Although the epimeric ions of y10,
y8, and y7 ions contain d/l-Trp, they do not show arrival time shifts (Figure 2D). These exceptions may be attributed to the possibilities
that the conformational differences are too small to be resolvable
due to limited resolving power of our IMS instrument, or due to other
factors that might have reduced the conformational differences of d/l-Trp.

Previous studies reported that d/l-peptide epimers exhibit conformational differences,
resulting in distinct mobilities in IMS.18 The orientation of the epimeric amino acid residues could produce
unique intramolecular interactions that lead to a more extended or
compact overall shape. In this study, we hypothesize that the same
phenomenon occurs with the CID-produced epimeric fragments. If the
fragments are epimers, the different amino acid orientation could
still produce unique intramolecular interactions and unique conformations.
However, if the fragments are identical, then the intramolecular interactions
and resulting conformations may also be identical. To support this
assumption, we measured the collision cross sections (CCSs) of the
precursor and fragment ions arising from d/l-MSH.21,22 The results are listed in Supporting Information Table S1, and their CCS differences (ΔCCSs) are illustrated
in Figure 2F. The standard deviations only
represent the reproducibility of the measurement, while the absolute
CCS error can be as large as 3.5%. The epimeric [M + 3H]3+ ions of d-MSH and l-MSH show a 6.9 Å2 of ΔCCS, which reveals their conformational differences
attributed to the substitution of d/l-Trp. The epimeric
fragment ions of y5–y11 containing d/l-Trp show an averaged ΔCCS of 1.2 Å2, while the y3 and y4 ions without d/l-Trp have an averaged ΔCCS of 0.2 Å2. More importantly, the epimeric y5 ions with d/l-Trp at the N-terminus exhibit a remarkable ΔCCS
of 4.3 Å2, which clearly indicates that the d-amino acid is localized at the tryptophan residue. In contrast,
the ΔCCSs of epimeric y10, y8, and y7 ions are 0.2, 0.2, and 0.7, respectively. These small differences
indicate a possible reason why their arrival time shifts are not resolved
in Figure 2D. The differences may be small
compared to the absolute error, but were very significant given the
excellent reproducibility of these measurements. More in-depth investigation
will be needed to fully understand the conformational differences
between d/l-peptide epimers. This work is primarily
focused on developing an alternative analytical methodology for discrimination
of peptide epimers. On the basis of the concept described above, two
smaller peptides are further investigated to validate the proposed
site-specific strategy.

Site-Specific Characterization of Deltorphin
and Achatin-I Peptide Epimers for Localization of d-Amino
Acids
Deltophins are a family of naturally occurring peptides
found in skin extracts of frogs. They have high affinity and selectivity
for δ opioid binding sites.24 Here, we choose [d-Ala]-DTP (YdAFDVVG–NH2) and
its all-l form (YAFDVVG–NH2) to further
validate our proposed strategy. The two peptide epimers are baseline-separated
by LC and eluted at 32.77 and 37.29 min (Figure 3, parts A and B), respectively. The arrival time measurement indicates
a shift of 0.16 ms between the two epimeric [M + H]+ ions
(Figure 3C). In the subsequent LC–MS/MS–IMS
experiment, the epimeric ions of y4, b4, b5, and b6 exhibit different mobility, leading to
arrival time shift as shown in Figure 3D. In
contrast, the paired y ions of y2–y5 derived
from the two peptide epimers display nearly identical arrival times.
Figure 3E summarizes the results of arrival
time shifts of these fragment ions, clearly indicating that the d-amino acid is localized at the second position from the N-terminus,
an alanine residue (YdAFDVVG–NH2).

Achatin-I (GdFAD) is a neuroexcitatory
peptide in Achatina fulica ganglia.25 On our nanoRPLC system, the achatin-I and its
all-l form (GFAD) were not baseline-separated due to a short
retention (data not shown). Alternative separation techniques, such
as chiral chromatography26 or capillary
electrophoresis,27 could be incorporated
into our strategy. To examine the proof of principle, we assume that
the two peptide epimers had been off-line separated, and the individual
peptide epimer was directly infused into mass spectrometer for MS–IMS
and MS/MS–IMS analysis. The [M + H]+ ions of the
two peptide epimers show the same arrival time at 5.20 ms. The immeasurable
arrival time shift may be attributed to the limited resolution of
our IMS instrument. Interestingly, the epimeric y3 ions
derived from the peptide epimers exhibit a 0.08 ms of arrival time
shift as shown in Figure 3F. In contrast, the
y2 ions from the two peptide epimers have identical arrival
time at 2.79 ms. These results provide precise positional information
for localization of d-amino acid at the phenylalanine of
GdFAD (Figure 3F).

Site-Specific
Characterization of d-Amino Acids in CHHs Isolated from the
American Lobster
To apply the site-specific strategy to identification
of DAACPs in real biological samples, we sequenced the CHHs in the
American lobster H. americanus and
determined the d-amino acid position in these large signaling
peptides. CHHs are a family of neurohormones released from crustacean
sinus glands, which regulates the glycemia through the classical mechanisms
of glycogen mobilization.28 Soyez and co-workers5,29 reported that the sinus gland of H. americanus secrets two peptide hormones, CHH-A and CHH-B, and both of CHH-A and CHH-B occur as two isoforms with d/l-Phe
at the third residue from the N-terminus. The biological activities
of the d/l-isoforms differ in the kinetics of their
hyperglycemic effect.5

The first
step is to identify and sequence the CHHs from the American lobster.
The identification is challenging, as CHHs contain more than 70 residues
and multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs), including three
disulfide bonds and N-terminal pGlu modification.19,28 In this work, we employed an online top-down approach. The intact
peptide and dithiothreitol (DTT)-reduced peptide were analyzed on
a high-resolution Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer by targeted
MS/MS to acquire high-quality top-down MS and MS/MS spectra. Figure 4A shows the isotopic distributions of the CHH-A before and after reduction of disulfide bonds with
an error less than 2 ppm. The mass increase of 6 Da resulting from
DTT reduction suggests that the peptides contain three disulfide bonds,
which is an important criterion to discriminate CHHs from other peptide
families.28 Figure 4B is the top-down high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS
spectrum of the reduced CHH-A. Compared with HCD
fragmentation of the intact CHH-A (data not shown),
the efficiency of peptide fragmentation is dramatically improved due
to elimination of disulfide linkage, where 46% of sequence coverage
and 62% of amide bond cleavage are achieved. The fragmentation maps
of CHH-A and CHH-B are shown in
Figure 4C. These results confirm the identities
of the two CHHs in American lobster. However, baseline separation
of d- and l-CHHs by nanoRPLC is difficult (Supporting Information Figure S-2) because of
the negligible differences of the hydrophobicity and sequence-dependent
effects of the d/l-isoforms attributed to the third d/l-Phe. Therefore, we adopted a bottom-up approach
in the following experiment.

Figure 4 Identification of CHH-A and
CHH-B peptides (isolated from the sinus glands of
American lobsters) by top-down MS/MS. (A) Isotopic distributions of
intact and DTT-reduced CHH-A. (B) HCD MS/MS spectrum

maps of CHH-A and CHH-B:⌉,
b ions; ⌊, y ions. The different residues between the two CHH
peptides are highlighted in blue. The d-Phe residue is localized
in the third position from the N-terminus, highlighted in green shading.

The second step is to find the
target tryptic peptide epimers that contain d/l-amino
acids. After treatment with DTT and IAA, the crude extract was digested
by trypsin and analyzed by RPLC–MS/MS in a data-dependent mode
and processed using software PEAKS30 against
a database containing the sequences of CHH-A and
CHH-B. Supporting Information Table S2 lists all the tryptic peptides and their corresponding
LC retention times. The tryptic peptide CHH[1–8] is eluted
at 21.42 and 26.69 min, and CHH[1–17] at 33.21 and 35.70 min.
The elution pattern of splitting peaks suggests the possibility that
the two peptides are d/l-epimer candidates. In contrast,
the rest of tryptic peptides are eluted at single time points without
splitting. Figure 5A shows the representative
extracted ion chromatogram of tryptic peptide pQVFDQAC*K
(pQ, pyro-Gln; *, carbamindomethyl), where the d/l-peptide epimer candidates are baseline-separated.
It should be noted that CHH-A and CHH-B share the same N-terminal sequence from 1pyro-Gln to 19Leu, and the residue d/l-Phe is at the
third position from the N-terminus.5,29 To obtain
the precise d-amino acid information of each peptide, the
two CHHs should be purified and separately analyzed. The goal of our
study is to examine the practical utility of the site-specific strategy
in a real biological sample. Herein, we used a simplified experimental
procedure by directly investigating the entire tryptic digest of the
tissue extracts.

ion chromatogram and (B) MS/MS of the tryptic peptide epimers I and
II. (C) IMS distributions of fragment ions from tryptic peptide epimers
I and II. (D) Localization of d-amino acid residue by comparison
of arrival time shift: √, arrival time shift; ×, no shift.
It should be noted that the elution order of the two d/l-peptide epimers cannot be determined by our current method,
so we use epimer I and II for annotation.

The third step is to localize the d-amino acid in
the target tryptic peptides, pQVFDQAC*K and pQVFDQAC*KGVYDRNLFK. The entire tryptic digest of the tissue
extracts was analyzed by LC–MS–IMS and LC–MS/MS–IMS.
Parts B and C of Figure 5 show the MS/MS spectra
of peptide epimers, pQVd/lFDQAC*K, and the corresponding arrival time distributions of
the fragment ions. As summarized in Figure 5D, the paired y ions of y2–y5 derived
from the two peptide epimers have the same arrival time, whereas those
of b4, y6, [M + H]+, and [M + 2H]2+ display arrival time shifts. Similarly, LC–MS/MS–IMS
analysis of peptide epimers pQVFDQAC*KGVYDRNLFK (Figure 6) indicates that the paired y ions of y5–y14 show identical arrival time distributions,
whereas those of y15, b4, and [M + H]+ ions exhibit arrival time shifts. These results suggest that the d-amino acid is localized at the phenylalanine of the third
residue of the CHHs from the N-terminus.

√, arrival time shift; ×, no shift.

Practical Utility of the Site-Specific Strategy
In this
work, we demonstrated the broad application and practical utility
of the site-specific strategy for the characterization of DAACPs and
their all-l counterparts. By employing LC–MS/MS–IMS,
the position of d-amino acid in the peptide epimers can be
rapidly and precisely determined. Specifically, the LC–MS/MS
experiment serves as a means to screen for d/l-peptide
epimer candidates in biological samples, so the initial candidates
of d/l-peptide epimers must display differential
LC retention times. An LC–MS–IMS experiment can be carried
out to measure the arrival time of the peptide molecular ions to obtain
complementary IMS evidence to support the initial identification of
peptide epimers. Lastly, the site-specific strategy based on LC–MS/MS–IMS
experiment is utilized to localize the d-amino acid.

The coexistence of DAACP and its all-l form counterpart
is widely found in biological systems due to incomplete enzymatic
isomerization of an l- to d-amino acid. In contrast,
some DAACPs are uniquely found without their all-l counterparts.2,4 Characterization of these DAACPs does not require the online separation
prior to MS/MS–IMS analysis. The purified DAACP candidate and
the synthetic all-l counterpart can be infused into mass
spectrometer for IMS analysis separately, and the d-amino
acid can be localized by the site-specific strategy outlined in this
study. In addition, our site-specific strategy can be incorporated
into the nontargeted strategies for DAACP discovery. For example,
Ewing et al.31 employed microsomal alanyl
aminopeptidase to selectively degrade peptides lacking a d-amino acid in the second position from the N-terminus, so the DAACPs
can be identified from a complex mixture. Our site-specific strategy
can serve as a downstream tool for validation of these putative DAACP
candidates. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some peptide
epimers and their CID-produced fragments show identical mobility (maybe
slightly different conformations) in spite of containing d/l-amino acids, or their mobility differences are too small
to be resolvable by current IMS instrumentation, such as the case
for the epimeric y7, y8, and y10 ions
of d/l-MSH (Figure 2D).

In this study, we measured the arrival time distributions of y, b,
and molecular ions of peptide epimers, indicative of the d-amino acid position. It is expected that other peptide fragment
ions, such as a, c, z, neutral loss ions, etc., could be used as indicators
for site-specific characterization because of being sensitive to chirality.
Also, the charge state of epimeric fragment ions could be a factor
which influences their conformational difference, leading to various
arrival time shifts. In this study, we chose the most abundant fragment
ions as indicators for comparison of arrival times. One of our ongoing
studies is to investigate the effect of charge states on the conformational
difference of peptide epimers. In addition, the peptide epimers are
eluted at different time points by LC solvents containing different
percentage of organic phase. For example, the d-MSH and l-MSH were eluted in 24% and 25% of acetonitrile, respectively.
To rule out the possibility of that the arrival time shift was caused
by various different organic phase percentages in solvents, we analyzed
the l-MSH in 24% and 30% of acetonitrile by direct infusion
into MS/MS–IMS and found that the arrival time distributions
of peptide precursor ions and fragment ions were identical between
two solvent conditions (Supporting Information Figure S-3). This result suggests that the measurement conditions
between the two peptide epimers in one LC–MS/MS–IMS
run have a negligible effect on the changes of their arrival time
distributions in the gas phase in the ion mobility drift cell.

Conclusions
In this study, we report on a novel strategy for site-specific
characterization of peptide epimers, which allows rapid and precise
localization of d-amino acids in DAACP candidates. The analysis
can be finished in a single LC–MS/MS–IMS run, followed
by data processing in a simple and straightforward manner. The efficiency
and utility of the strategy have been demonstrated by analysis of
a set of peptides with various molecular sizes, MSH, DTP, and achatin-I,
and their counterparts possessing all-l amino acids. In the
CHHs isolated from the American lobster, our data indicates that the
peptides contain an isomerization site of l- to d-Phe at the third residue from the N-terminus. This study represents
a new route to obtain positional information about amino acid isomerizations
in peptides by elucidating the IMS data of peptide fragment ions.
By coupling with efficient screening approaches, the developed strategy
is potentially applicable to large-scale discovery and characterization
of DAACPs, and the proposed concept is transferable to the characterization
of other post-translational isomerizations in large biological molecules.
