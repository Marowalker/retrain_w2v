There
is much interest in using nanosensors to monitor biologically
relevant species such as glucose, or cellular pH, as these often become
dysregulated in diseases such as cancer. This information is often
inaccessible at depth in biological tissue, due to the highly scattering
nature of tissue. Here we show that gold nanoparticles labeled with
pH-sensitive reporter molecules can monitor pH at depth in biological
tissues. This was achieved using deep Raman spectroscopy (spatially
offset Raman and transmission Raman) in combination with surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy, allowing chemical information to be retrieved
significantly deeper than conventional Raman spectroscopy permits.
Combining these approaches with chemometrics enabled pH changes to
be monitored with an error of ±∼0.1 pH units noninvasively
through 22 mm of soft tissue. This development opens the opportunity
for the next generation of light-based medical diagnostic methods,
such as monitoring of cancers, known to significantly alter pH levels.

==== Body
The deep
Raman techniques, which
mainly comprise spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS)1,2 and transmission Raman spectroscopy (TRS),3 have been demonstrated to be versatile tools for the analysis of
complex diffusely scattering (turbid) samples at depth.4−6 These techniques are based around separating the laser illumination
and Raman collection zones from each other on the sample surface.
This allows signal retrieval on a scale of 2 orders of magnitude deeper
within turbid samples compared to traditional Raman approaches. These
developments have opened new applications of Raman spectroscopy in
a number of areas such as pharmaceutical drug analysis in quality
control,3 airport security screening,7 and in healthcare.8,9 Recent advances
in the deep Raman techniques have also established that not only can
specific chemical information that the Raman spectra inform upon be
retrieved, but also the physical properties of a sample such as temperature.
We previously named this approach temperature-SORS or T-SORS.10 This opens up further areas where this emerging
technology can play a disruptive role such as process control and
food manufacturing. It has also been previously demonstrated that
combining SORS with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SESORS) can
allow monitoring of chemical signals at depth.11−13 Elsewhere,
much work using traditional SERS has recently focused on creating
stable SERS nanosensors that can detect and monitor a number of biologically
relevant moieties or processes, such as pH14−16 and redox levels,17 among many others.18,19 In this context, the ability to accurately monitor in vivo pH levels
at a depth that is noninvasive is of particular relevance to a number
of diseases, where disruption to the usually tightly regulated pH
value is a possible indicator of an associated disease state such
as cancer20−22 and is known to be an important factor in wound healing
and infections.23 For example, in healthy
breast tissue, the average intracellular pH (pHi) is ∼7.2
and the extracellular pH (pHe) is ∼7.4; however,
in advanced invasive breast cancer, a reversal of the pH gradient
is observed with a pHi and pHe of 7.2 and 6.7,
respectively.24 To date, most of the studies
using SERS nanosensors have been performed in transparent samples,
that is, optical vials, and the SERS enhancement was used as a way
to reduce measurement times and increase the sensitivity of analyte
detection. Pioneering experiments by Campbell et al. have demonstrated
the possibility of measuring subsurface pH levels using SERS nanoparticles
from zones within cell culture spheroids at depths of 0.5–1
mm using conventional Raman microscopy.25 Here we demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring pH levels noninvasively
in scattering tissue at depths by more than an order of magnitude
greater using combined labeled nanoparticles and the deep Raman approaches
(SESORS). This new capability opens exciting prospects in medical
sciences in photonic methods of diagnosis, for example, for early
stage noninvasive cancer diagnosis (e.g., breast cancer), where local
pH levels are significantly lowered from biological normal levels
by tumor driven hypoxia.17,22,25

Experimental Section
4-Mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) labeled
100 nm gold nanoparticles
were produced following a previously described method.16 A total of 1 mL of the gold nanoparticles (nanoComposix)
were mixed for 5 min with 100 μL of 1 mM MBA. This was followed
by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed
from the pellet of nanoparticles, which were then resuspended in 1
mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The pH of the
nanoparticle suspensions was adjusted with HCl and NaOH solutions
(0.5 M), and the pH was measured using a VWR pH110 pH meter. Porcine
tissue was purchased locally. For transmission Raman experiments,
a 35 × 35 × 35 mm3 cube of porcine tissue was
used with a central cavity, perpendicular to the optical axis, allowing
placement of a quartz cell (10 × 10 × 48 mm3)
containing the labeled nanoparticles. For the inverse SORS measurements,
the hole was cut off center at set distances from the side walls to
provide multiple depths (5, 8, and 12 mm), depending on the orientation
of the block of tissue with respect to the illumination beam. Meat
cores were pH-adjusted through overnight soaking in 50 mL of 10–50
mM arginine solutions. The meat cores were briefly rinsed with distilled
water prior to introduction of nanoparticles and homogenized after
experiments, and the pH was confirmed. Raman measurements were gathered
on a previously described home-built spatially offset Raman system
in Exeter.5 This system comprises two spatially
offset modalities, transmission Raman (TRS), where the Raman illumination
zone and collection zone are on the opposite sides of the sample (Scheme S1A). Transmission Raman measurements
provide a signal that is a composite of all constituents present within
the sample volume, that is, bulk analysis. The second deep Raman modality
is inverse SORS, where an axicon lens is used to create a variable
diameter ring-shaped laser illumination zone on the sample surface,
and Raman spectra are collected from the center of this zone, with
the radius of the illumination zone approximately corresponding to
the SORS spatial offset, Δs (Scheme S1B). As the values of Δs are
increased, in the inverse SORS modality, the larger the relative contribution
of the subsurface constituents to the surface ones is observed in
the collected Raman spectra. Due to this, SORS enables sensitive depth
discrimination, making it ideal in layer discrimination studies. A
laser with an 830 nm excitation wavelength was used (Innovative Photonic
Solutions: I0830MM0350MF-EM), the laser beam was filtered using two
830 nm laser line filters (Semrock) to provide a spectrally clean
laser profile. The resulting laser power at the sample surface was
around 350 mW. All Raman spectra were collected using an Andor iDus
420A – BR-DD deep depletion CCD, which was coupled to a Kaiser
spectrometer (Holospec 1.8i) with an f-number of
1.8. Raman spectra of suspended nanoparticles within the vial were
measured for 2.5 s × 24 (=60 s), while nanoparticles once buried
in tissue were measured for 5 s × 120 (=600 s). All Raman spectra
were processed using Matlab 2014a; in summary, the data was baseline
corrected with a linear fit under the region of interest (1550–1620
cm–1), all data was intensity normalized [0, 1]
and the x-axis was interpolated to 0.1 cm–1 increments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to create
a scores model of MBA sensitivity to pH, and new Raman data collected
from nanoparticles buried in meat was projected onto this model and
a pH estimate calculated.

Results and Discussion
Our measurements
were performed on porcine tissue (Figure 1A) with a thickness of 35 mm.
The collected Raman spectra remained stable throughout the experiment,
with only a slight drop in the background fluorescence signal being
observed (Figure 1B).
MBA-NP’s have a number of active Raman bands (Figure 1C), with several of them being
sensitive to the local pH levels.14−16

However, to be suitable for monitoring pH at depths in turbid
media,
ideally the chosen reporter band should have a large Raman cross-section
and, preferably, be nonoverlapping with the Raman signal of the surrounding
medium, thus, simplifying analysis and increasing the maximal depth
a signal can be recovered from. With these considerations in mind,
the benzene ring stretching mode of MBA was chosen as a pH reporter
due to exhibiting a measurable peak shift with changes in pH levels
(Figure 1D) and minimally
overlapping with the tissue Raman signal. Once the MBA-NP are inserted
into the porcine tissue, the overall observable MBA signal in both
modalities is considerably diminished (Figure 2A,B), with only the generally invariant ring
breathing mode at ∼1078 cm–1 and the ring
stretching mode ∼1585 cm–1 still being identifiable
in the spectrum by the naked eye.

correction and data scaling.

The approach explored here prohibits basic ratio-metric (univariate)
analysis that has been previously reported in the literature as the
Raman bands that this analysis is based on are still readily overwhelmed
by the tissue signal. For this reason we have resorted to multivariate
analysis to extract maximum informational content from data. Specifically,
we used principal component analysis (PCA) in this study. For nonburied
NPs, in the pH range that was explored (∼6.2–7.8), a
strong correlation was present between the peak position of the ring
stretching mode of MBA-NP (nonburied) and pH (R2 ∼ 0.92; Figure 3A). The spectral region of 1520–1620 cm–1 was used to create a PCA model of the spectral variation. In this
model, 99% of the variance was explained in PC1, and an improved R2 value was observed (R2 0.95) plotting the intensity scores of PC1 versus pH levels
(Figure 3B). Furthermore,
a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.11 pH units was achieved in a
leave one out cross validation of this model. Using the PCA model
constructed of the MBA-NP measured alone (i.e., outside tissue), it
was possible to project new measurements, that is, of the MBA-NP once
enclosed in the porcine tissue. As is observable, the loadings of
PC1 for the model of nanoparticles matches that of the data set that
is surrounded with porcine tissue (i.e., buried NP’s), albeit
with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 3C). Furthermore, it was possible to predict
the pH level based on this approach, with an RMSEP of 0.13 pH units
achieved, which is only a slight increase in error of prediction compared
with the original nonburied model, validating the robustness of this
approach (Figure 3D).

Due to the sample size/access
requirements of TRS it has more limited
applications in vivo, for example, measuring through the hand or breast
tissue. Therefore, in addition to the TRS measurements of the MBA-NP
in porcine tissue, the nanoparticles were also measured using the
inverse SORS modality. This mode is beneficial in situations where
access to the other side of sample is not possible, or the sample
size is prohibitively too large to be measured in transmission. However,
the penetration depths achievable with SORS are approximately half
of those achievable with TRS. For these experiments the nanoparticles
were inserted in an off-center hole (Figure 4A), thereby providing multiple depths (5,
8, and 12 mm) from different tissue side walls, where the depth was
set by the orientation of the tissue block with respect to the laser
illumination axis.

(5, 8, and 12 mm, respectively), when buried in porcine tissue. (C)
Predicted pH levels using SORS vs actual pH levels using the PCA scores
model.

As to be expected, the depth of
sample has a large influence on
the observed Raman intensity of the nanoparticles. At the most superficial
depth (5 mm), the MBA-NP dominates that of the meat signal (Figure 4B), while at 12 mm
depth, the MBA-NP signal is comparable to the tissue intensity. The
same approach was taken as with the TRS data, that being a PCA model
of the nonburied MBA-NPs was first created, then new data from buried
NPs was projected onto this. An apparent trend is observed that as
the signal-to-noise of the data decreases, that is, is recovered from
deeper within the porcine tissue, there is a worsening of RMSEP of
pH (from 0.09 to 0.23 pH units). The explored pH levels achieved accuracy
in a biologically important range, as cancerous lesions are known
to exhibit lower extracellular pH levels (6.7) compared with healthy
biological tissue (7.4).24 As such, cancer
diagnosis based around pH levels alone, or in conjunction with other
chemical markers derived from SORS signals, could be used to identify
the presence of such lesions and monitor the efficacy of treatments.
Other potential applications include the monitoring of the presence
of infections and their healing, the monitoring of pH levels in industrial
manufacture in process and quality control (e.g., biopharmaceutical
manufacture) or in the food industry where pH levels could signify,
for example, the spoilage or maturity of food products: meat, dairy
products, and so on. Finally, to demonstrate the overall robustness
of pH monitoring using MBA labeled nanoparticles, they were inserted
directly into porcine tissue (Figure 5A). Due to the continuation of anaerobic respiration
in animal muscle tissue postslaughter and a subsequent buildup of
lactic acid, tissue of “high quality” for retail has
a pH between 5.4 and 5.8. Due to this being lower than what is expected
in living organisms, the tissue pH was adjusted in a series of meat
cores with a known range of pH from ∼6 to 7.5. With the nanoparticles
directly inserted into tissue, it was still possible to accurately
monitor the pH of the tissue cores, monitoring the position of the
SERS Raman reporter allowed prediction of pH with an RMSEP of ∼0.2
pH units.

Conclusions
The feasibility of monitoring pH at a significant
depth in porcine
tissue, using labeled nanoparticles, has been demonstrated using both
of the two principal deep Raman approaches (TRS and SORS). A biologically
relevant range of pH levels were explored (6.2–7.8 pH units).
Accurate reporting was easily achievable in both deep Raman modalities
with a best RMSEP ∼ 0.1 pH units, with transmission Raman yielding
a deeper retrieval (22 mm tissue thickness in optical path) of pH-sensitive
information compared to inverse SORS (8 mm).

The approach holds
promise for future noninvasive photon-based
disease diagnosis in situations where local pH levels are altered
(e.g., breast cancer).
