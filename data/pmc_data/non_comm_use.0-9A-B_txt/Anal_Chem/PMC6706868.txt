Visualizing the distributions
of drugs and their metabolites is
one of the key emerging application areas of matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization–mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI)
within pharmaceutical research. The success of a given MALDI-MSI experiment
is ultimately determined by the ionization efficiency of the compounds
of interest, which in many cases are too low to enable detection at
relevant concentrations. In this work we have taken steps to address
this challenge via the first application of laser-postionisation coupled
with MALDI (so-called MALDI-2) to the analysis and imaging of pharmaceutical
compounds. We demonstrate that MALDI-2 increased the signal intensities
for 7 out of the 10 drug compounds analyzed by up to 2 orders of magnitude
compared to conventional MALDI analysis. This gain in sensitivity
enabled the distributions of drug compounds in both human cartilage
and dog liver tissue to be visualized using MALDI-2, whereas little-to-no
signal from tissue was obtained using conventional MALDI. This work
demonstrates the vast potential of MALDI-2-MSI in pharmaceutical research
and drug development and provides a valuable tool to broaden the application
areas of MSI. Finally, in an effort to understand the ionization mechanism,
we provide the first evidence that the preferential formation of [M
+ H]+ ions with MALDI-2 has no obvious correlation with
the gas-phase proton affinity values of the analyte molecules, suggesting,
as with MALDI, the occurrence of complex and yet to be elucidated
ionization phenomena.

==== Body
Determining
the distributions
of pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites within tissues is
an important step in drug development. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)
is playing an increasing role in drug development owing to its ability
to simultaneously detect and differentiate the spatial distributions
of both drugs and their metabolites while simultaneously imaging endogenous
biomolecules such as lipids, metabolites, and proteins.1 Various desorption/ionization methods, including
desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)2,3 and
secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS),4−6 have been deployed
for drug and metabolite imaging in tissues and even individual cells.7−9 Of these, matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization (MALDI) has
been most widely utilized. Nowadays, imaging for pharmaceutical compounds
is one of the emerging applications of MSI,10,11 which enables monitoring both drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics
(DMPK), even with absolute quantification.12−14 MALDI-MSI typically
offers the capability to detect many molecular classes depending on
the employed sample preparation methods and spatial resolutions which
can be as low as 10 μm for commercial instruments15 and down to ∼1 μm for prototype
systems.16,17 In addition to pharmaceutical imaging, MALDI-MSI
has been applied successfully in different fields where both spatial
and spectral information are needed, such as pathology,18 clinical applications,19 biomarker discovery,20 and forensics.21

MSI of pharmaceuticals (or any analyte)
is not without challenges.
MALDI, like all ionization methods, suffers from a low ionization
efficiency for many analytes. Ionization efficiencies (i.e., the ratio
of MALDI-generated ions to desorbed neutrals) are estimated to be
on the order of 1 × 10–4 and lower.22−24 This imposes a significant sensitivity limit as many molecules are
not detected by mass spectrometry at relevant concentrations. Furthermore,
ionization efficiencies can vary by orders of magnitude for different
compounds and it is often difficult to predict whether a given analyte
will have a higher ionization efficiency than another, thereby making
the success of a given MSI experiment hard to predict a priori. This
effect is augmented further in MSI studies where tissue-dependent
ion suppression effects can additionally inhibit sensitivity heterogeneously
within a sample.25,26 Given the fact that ionization
efficiency is a key factor in determining the limit of detection,
it is an important metric for quantitative pharmaceutical-focused
MSI studies.

Selective chemical derivatization of specific functional
groups
of target analyte(s) is one strategy to improve ionization efficiency.
The most common approach is to introduce a fixed-charge quaternary
nitrogen group to the analyte.27−29 However, derivatization also
has drawbacks like long reaction times (up to several hours for completion)
and potential delocalization masking the true distribution of target
compounds. Online derivatization methods, such as reactive DESI, can
help ameliorate these effects but typically has lower spatial resolution
than MALDI.30 An alternative method to
enhance MALDI ionization efficiencies is the use of postionization
strategies. These methods deploy a second ionization event spatially
and temporally separated from the primary laser desorption event to
increase the overall yield of ions.31 Unlike
derivatization, postionization does not require additional sample
preparation steps and can be performed directly on samples prepared
for conventional MALDI analysis. For example, Lu et al. reported postionization
using 118 nm photons coupled with 532 nm direct laser desorption and
demonstrated significant sensitivity improvements for folic acid detection
in mouse tumor tissue.32 More recently,
plasma ionization coupled with atmospheric pressure MALDI also revealed
significant gains in sensitivity for a number of lipid and drug species.33 Alternatively, Soltwisch et al. combined laser
postionization with MALDI using a UV OPO laser, emitting photons capable
of inducing two-photon ionization of desorbed matrix molecules.34 To explain the enhancement of ion yield, it
is hypothesized that matrix radical cations formed by photoionization
interact with themselves and neutral molecules in the still relatively
dense MALDI plume. These interactions form intermediate reactive species
capable of ionizing neutral molecules via protonation/deprotonation
processes (Supporting Information, Figure 1). This process also shares many similarities with conventional MALDI
in that ionization is driven by initial ionization of the matrix and
subsequent ion/molecule reactions. This method, termed MALDI-2, was
shown to provide increased sensitivity, of up to 2 orders of magnitude,
for many lipid species.34,35 In this work, we report
the first application of MALDI-2 for the enhanced detection and imaging
of pharmaceutical compounds. We demonstrate that the sensitivity for
a variety of tested compounds poorly ionized by MALDI was substantially
improved by MALDI-2 in the positive-ion mode. Combined, this work
represents a substantial leap in the analytical capabilities of MALDI-MSI
for studying drug metabolism in tissues.

Tissue Collection
Cartilage
The cartilage was obtained from an osteoarthritic
patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty and rinsed with PBS containing
1% P/S. Explants from cartilage tissue (5 × 5 mm) were placed
in a 24-well plate and incubated with TAA (43.5 ng/μL) at a
total volume of 500 μL for 48 h in a humidified incubator in
an environment of 5% CO2 and 37 °C. After the incubation,
cartilage chips were rinsed with ice-cold ammonium acetate buffer
(150 mM, pH 7.3), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80
°C until analysis.

Liver
Janssen R&D (Beerse, Belgium)
provided canine
liver tissue dosed with drug compound A at 65 mg/kg. Liver was resected,
snap-frozen on aluminum foil floating on liquid nitrogen, and subsequently
stored at −80 °C until sectioning and analysis. For confidentiality
reasons, structural information on the drug cannot be revealed and
only nominal mass information can be supplied.

All tissues were

MALDI Sample Preparation
Single Standard
Analysis
Ten compounds (ketoconazole,
terfenadine, haloperidol, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, kynurenine, triamcinolone
acetonide, caffeine, fluoxetine, and ibuprofen) were separately prepared
and mixed with DHB matrix solution (20 mg/mL, 70% MeOH, + 0.2% TFA)
obtaining a final drug concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The full list of
drugs can be found in the Supporting Information, Table 1. The drug-matrix solution was sprayed onto an ITO-coated
glass slide using a TM-Sprayer (HTX Technologies, U.S.A.) to obtain
a homogeneous coating of each drug/matrix mixture. The spraying parameters
were as follows: flow rate, 0.11 mL/min; velocity, 1200 mm/min; temperature
of the nozzle, 85 °C; track spacing, 2 mm; and pressure, 10 psi.
Diluted solutions were also prepared for doxorubicin, paclitaxel (0.05
mg/mL), ketoconazole, terfenadine, and haloperidol (0.05 and 0.001
mg/mL) and sprayed onto the glass slide using the same protocol.

Triamcinolone Acetonide Sensitivity Evaluation
A dilution
series was prepared and mixed with DHB (20 mg/mL prepared in 70% MeOH,
30% water, and 0.2% TFA) to give final solution concentrations of
0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.5 ng/μL.
Each solution was sprayed onto a separate glass slide. Ten layers
of the matrix/TAA solution were applied on the slide using the TM-Sprayer
with the same parameters described above.

Tissue Imaging
For tissue imaging experiments, 12 layers
of DHB (20 mg/mL prepared in 70% MeOH with 0.2% TFA) were sprayed
onto the tissue sections using the TM-sprayer: flow rate, 0.11 mL/min;
velocity, 1200 mm/min; temperature of the nozzle, 75 °C; track
spacing, 2 mm; and pressure, 10 psi.

Mass Spectrometry and Laser
Postionization
An Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)
coupled to an intermediate pressure MALDI/ESI interface (Spectroglyph
LLC, Kennewick, WA, U.S.A.) was used for all experiments.36 Data were acquired in the positive-ion mode
at a mass resolution setting of 120000 or 240000 when mentioned (fwhm
@ m/z 400) and an ion injection
time of 250 ms. Automatic gain control was disabled in all experiments.
Laser postionization (MALDI-2) was performed as previously described.35 Unless reported otherwise, all experiments were
performed using a repetition rate of 100 Hz, a MALDI-2 wavelength
in the 260–280 nm range, a pulse energy of 500 μJ and
a pulse delay time of 5 μs. Further details are provided in
the Supporting Information.

Data Acquisition
Drug
Profiling
Each drug standard and mixture was analyzed
sequentially with MALDI-2 (100 Hz repetition rate) and conventional
MALDI (100 and 1000 Hz repetition rate). Data were acquired by setting
up a rectangular scan area (50 μm step size) within which MALDI-2
data were acquired for three rows after which the MALDI-2 laser was
disabled and MALDI data acquired. For data analysis, 50 scans in each
row were averaged to compare the signal intensity from each experiment,
while error bars were determined from the standard deviation acquired
from three consecutive rows. In the case that analyte signals were
unresolved from isotopes of lower m/z fragments (e.g., [the M – H2 + H]+ ion
of terfenadine) isotope correction of ion intensities was performed.
The sensitivity evaluation only took in consideration the concentrations
presenting a signal-to-noise (S/N) superior to 3 when averaging 50 scans. The S/N values were provided by Thermo Xcalibur 3.0.63 software.
To calculate the concentration density per surface area, the values
were extracted from the HTX imaging software and converted in ng/mm2.

Imaging Experiments
MSI data from
human cartilage was
acquired across half the tissue using MALDI-2, after which the MALDI-2
laser was disabled and MALDI-MSI data acquired. For the dog liver
sample, first 1 cm2 of tissue was acquired with both MALDI
and MALDI-2 to evaluate the postionization benefits. Then, a consecutive
full section was acquired at a pixel size of 30 × 30 μm2. Data from cartilage was acquired at a pixel size of 50 ×
50 μm2. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed
directly on tissue to identify triamcinolone acetonide using resonance
collision-induced dissociation in the ion trap with a normalized collision
energy of 30. An isolation window of 1 m/z unit was employed.

Data Analysis
Spectral analysis and visualization were
performed using Thermo Xcalibur 3.0.63 and mMass 5.5.0.37 MSI data was reconstructed and visualized using
in-house developed software written in MATLAB (Matlab; Mathworks,
Natick, MA, U.S.A.; R2014a) as previously described.38 All images are generated following total-ion-count normalization.

Tissue Staining
The intestine sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Cartilage tissue was stained
using safranin-O for 2 min and Fast Green. For more details, please
see Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Proof-of-Concept:
Triamcinolone Acetonide
Triamcinolone
acetonide (TAA), a corticosteroid used to treat pain and inflammation,
was chosen to evaluate the analytical merit of MALDI-2. Previous studies
required TAA derivatization using Girard’s reagent T for detection
of the drug from cartilage tissues using MALDI-MSI.27 For analysis of the TAA standard, the matrix-drug solution
was sprayed onto an ITO-coated slide. Using this standard, the alignment
and timing of the MALDI-2 laser were optimized to maximize the signal
for the [TAA + H]+ ion at m/z 435.2184. Regarding alignment, practically, optimal MALDI-2 signal
was obtained by bringing the MALDI-2 laser as close as possible to
the surface without touching it (∼200–400 μm).
Contact between the MALDI-2 laser and the sample surface can be observed
by the presence of matrix and/or drug signal when the desorption (MALDI)
laser is disabled. The highest TAA signal was achieved using a delay
time (the time between the MALDI and MALDI-2 laser pulse) of 5–10
μs (Supporting Information, Figure 2A), consistent with previous observations for small molecules (Supporting Information, Figure 2B,C).34 The optimal delay time is governed by the velocity
of the desorbed analyte ions and neutrals, which is largely determined
by ion mobility-related effects in this pressure regime (10 mbar). Figure 1 shows representative
MALDI (bottom, blue trace) and MALDI-2 spectra (top, red trace) acquired
from the deposited TAA standard. Using conventional MALDI, the [M
+ H]+ ion of TAA observed at m/z 435.2184 was barely detectable while the corresponding
[M + Na]+ ion at m/z 457.2198
was detected with a 42-fold higher intensity. Using MALDI-2, the [M
+ H]+ ion was preferentially formed and exhibited 460-
and 11-fold higher signals than the corresponding protonated and sodiated
molecules detected using conventional MALDI, respectively. The formation
of predominantly protonated analyte (rather than alkali adducted species)
using MALDI-2 is consistent with earlier reports on the use of MALDI-2
for lipid imaging.34,35

Enhanced Detection of Multiple
Drug Standards Using MALDI-2
We next compared the signal
intensities generated from 10 different
pharmaceutical compounds (including TAA) analyzed using both MALDI
and MALDI-2. The full list of compounds is provided in Supporting Information, Table 1. Prior to measurements,
each drug was individually mixed with DHB matrix solution to give
a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and sprayed onto separate slides.
The results from these experiments are provided in Figure 2, while representative single-scan
spectra and signal-to-noise (S/N) values are provided in Supporting Information, Figure 3. Figure 2A shows the comparative signal intensities generated from the corresponding
protonated molecules (with the exception of ibuprofen, see below),
produced using both MALDI and MALDI-2.

over MALDI for a panel of ten different
compounds. (A) Absolute intensities for the [M + H]+ ([M]•+ for ibuprofen) ions generated by MALDI (blue) and
MALDI-2 (red) for 10 compounds at 0.5 mg/mL concentration. Error bars

(B) Representative MALDI (bottom, blue trace) and MALDI-2 (top, red
trace) single scan spectra for each compound shown in (A). Protonated
species are marked with a (■) and radical cations indicated
with a (●).

Three compounds, ketoconazole
(m/z 531.1556, [M + H]+), terfenadine (m/z 472.3207, [M
+ H]+), and haloperidol (m/z 376.1469, [M + H]+) produced
the highest signal intensities with conventional MALDI and the smallest
fractional improvement with MALDI-2 improvements of ∼4-, 1.3-,
and 2-fold, respectively. Terfenadine produced an abundant fragment
ion at m/z 470.3065 assigned to
a [M – H2 + H]+ fragment (2.2 ppm mass
error). This fragment was only observed with MALDI-2 and was present
at approximately twice the intensity of the [M + H]+ ion
(Supporting Information, Figure 4). The
observed MALDI-2-specific fragmentation alludes to differences in
the ionization mechanisms of MALDI and MALDI-2.

A second regime
of six compounds (doxorubicin, paclitaxel, kynurenine,
TAA, caffeine, and fluoxetine) exhibited greater fractional enhancements
using MALDI-2, with a signal improvement for the [M + H]+ ions of at least 1 order of magnitude observed for each compound.
Kynurenine, TAA, and caffeine showed, respectively, a 140-, 130-,
and 380-fold increase in signal for the [M + H]+ ion. As
mentioned above, MALDI-2-induced fragmentation was also apparent for
terfenadine. A fragment ion at m/z 286.1083 was observed for paclitaxel and detected with comparable
signal intensity as the corresponding [M + H]+ ion generated
using MALDI-2 (Supporting Information, Figure 5). This fragment is assigned to the loss of the pentadecene
ring-functionality forming a [M + H – C31H37O10]+ ion. Analogous fragment ions generated
from the deprotonated species have previously been reported using
MALDI and MS/MS in negative-ion mode.39,40 A ∼15-fold
gain was recorded for doxorubicin (m/z 544.1829; [M + H]+).

While the above comparisons
were focused on the relative increase
in protonated species, it is a common observation that many compounds
ionize more efficiently as [M + Na]+ ions. Of these 10
compounds, four compounds produced more abundant [M + Na]+ ions than [M + H]+ ions using conventional MALDI (doxorubicin,
paclitaxel, kynurenine, and TAA). Thus, we compared the [M + Na]+ intensity of MALDI with that of the [M + H]+ ion
formed by MALDI-2. MALDI-2 still yielded overall higher intensities
for these compounds, as demonstrated in Supporting Information, Figure 6A.

We acknowledge the high concentration
of drug standards used to
generate the data shown in Figure 2. For well-ionizable compounds, this high concentration
could potentially result in signals that exceed the single-scan dynamic
range of the Orbitrap analyzer.41 We therefore
analyzed five of the same drug compounds following dilutions of between
10- and 500-fold to evaluate the gain in signal for lower concentrations.
As shown in Figure 2, terfenadine, haloperidol, and ketoconazole produced the highest
MALDI and MALDI-2 signal intensities and the lowest fractional improvement
using MALDI-2. At a 500-fold dilution (0.001 mg/mL), the [M + H]+ signal acquired using MALDI was twice higher than for MALDI-2
in the case of terfenadine and 3× higher for haloperidol and
near-identical for ketoconazole (Supporting Information, Figure 7). This shift in the preferred ionization mode can
possibly be explained by the dramatically higher matrix:analyte ratio
of these diluted solutions, which could alter the relative efficiencies
of the MALDI and MALDI-2 processes. Nonetheless, and in line with Figure 2, these three compounds
still gave the most similar ion intensities for MALDI and MALDI-2.
Doxorubicin and paclitaxel were analyzed at a 10-fold dilution (0.05
mg/mL) and showed similar gains in signal intensity observed for MALDI-2
as those provided in Figure 2 (Supporting Information, Figure 7). For these diluted standards, we also compared the MALDI [M + Na]+ ion formation with the [M + H]+ intensity from
MALDI-2 showing that the protonated molecules obtained with MALDI-2
presented higher signal than the MALDI-generated sodiated ions (Supporting Information, Figure 7).

One
compound, ibuprofen, was not detectable at all using regular
MALDI in the positive-ion mode. Interestingly MALDI-2 analysis yielded
higher signal for the corresponding radical species (M+•) than for the closed-shell protonated species. The latter observation
is unsurprising given the acidic nature of ibuprofen and the expectation
that such species would form deprotonated, negatively charged species
with a far greater efficiency. However, this observation also highlights
a second advantage of MALDI-2 with the ability to access photoionization
channels that are independent of typical cationization/deprotonation
ionization processes for analytes that absorb the MALDI-2 laser light.
It also highlights how molecules can be liberated into the gas-phase
by the primary MALDI pulse but not ionized, such that they remain
undetected. In this case the formation of the [M]+• ion of ibuprofen can be explained by a 2-photon resonance enhanced
multiphoton photoionization (REMPI) process. Ibuprofen exhibits a
peak UV-absorption at 263 nm, hence radical cation formation can be
attributed to absorption of the MALDI-2 laser light (λ = 260
nm)42 by ibuprofen and subsequent absorption
of a second photon ionizes the molecules. Radical cations were also
detected in the MALDI-2 analysis of aromatic ketoconazole, doxorubicin,
and caffeine (Figure 2B, circle labels).

The ion generation rate of MALDI-2 is currently
limited by the
relatively low repetition rate of the postionization laser (100 Hz
in our experimental setup). For typical MSI applications the MALDI
laser is operated at 1 kHz, which enables total depletion of a sampling
spot within the 250 ms ion injection time. Therefore, we also compared
the signal intensity of MALDI-2 with the protonated and sodiated molecules
generated by conventional MALDI operating at 1 kHz. Overall, MALDI
data generated with a laser repetition rate of 1 kHz resulted in <1
order of magnitude gain compared to 100 Hz (1.3-fold gain for ketoconazole
to 8.1-fold gain for ibuprofen; Supporting Information, Figure 6B). In this analysis, MALDI-2 still provided higher
signals for the protonated species than MALDI, but for several species
that formed more abundant sodium adducts, MALDI generated slightly
higher intensities (e.g., ibuprofen and doxorubicin; Supporting Information, Figure 6C).

MALDI-2 Sensitivity Evaluation
To test the sensitivity
of both conventional MALDI and MALDI-2, a range of TAA concentrations
were prepared and analyzed using both methods by mixing TAA with a
DHB matrix solution to give final concentrations of 0.005–2.5
ng/μL sprayed on glass slides (corresponding to 2.29 ×
10–3–1.15 ng/mm2). Overall, MALDI-2
produced higher signal for every concentration for the protonated
form of TAA, with up to a 13-fold higher signal compared to the sodiated
form. After averaging 50 consecutive scans we were able to detect
the protonated TAA down to 4.58 × 10–1 ng/mm2 with MALDI and 2.29 × 10–3 ng/mm2 with MALDI-2, a 200-fold difference (Figure 3). For sodiated TAA, MALDI-2 presented an
overall higher signal. These results indicate that MALDI-2 provides
a higher analytical sensitivity for TAA.

TAA [M + H]+; circles, TAA [M + Na]+) and MALDI-2
(red: squares, TAA [M + H]+; circles, TAA [M + Na]+).

MALDI-2 Imaging of Pharmaceutical
Compounds in Tissue
Following the experiments on drug standards,
we evaluated the use
of MALDI-2 for MSI applications, specifically its ability to detect
the distribution of two different pharmaceutical compounds in two
different tissues. First, we investigated the ability to detect TAA
in human cartilage tissues following their incubation for 48 h in
a 24-well plate containing a TAA solution. Previous work demonstrated
that MSI analysis of TAA in similar tissues was only possible after
chemical derivatization.43Figure 4A shows that the [TAA + H]+ ion from tissue was readily detected by MALDI-2, whereas
no [TAA + H]+ or [TAA + Na]+ signals were observed
using MALDI. Importantly, the acquired MALDI-2 signal intensity was
sufficient to study the distribution of TAA (Figure 4B,C) and confirmed its identity using tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS; Supporting Information Figure 8).44 Consistent with earlier
reports using MALDI coupled with derivatization, a relatively homogeneous
distribution of the drug throughout the tissue was observed.43

and vitamin E, [M]•+ (G). (H) H&E staining of
dog liver tissue obtain following MSI data acquisition. All MSI data
are generated following total ion current normalization.

In addition, MALDI-2 was used to evaluate the liver distribution
of a drug under development, here referred to as compound A. As an
important candidate pharmaceutical designed for the treatment of prostate
cancer, it was canceled due to toxicity issues observed in the form
of fibrotic lesions in the livers of treated dogs. Recently, compound
A (the exact identity and mass cannot be provided due to confidentiality
reasons) was visualized in canine liver tissue using desorption electrospray
ionization (DESI) imaging and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).45 Using both MALDI and MALDI-2, we first screened
a ∼ 1 cm2 of tissue obtained from a treated dog
which developed lesions. MALDI revealed a very low signal intensity
for the drug compound (for the expected [M + H]+ ion at m/z 502 and was not detected at all for
[M + Na]+ ion) after inspection of the averaged spectra
across the analyzed tissue regions. By contrast, MALDI-2 resulted
in a 270-fold improvement in signal of the [M + H]+ ion
(Figure 4D). Following
this preliminary test, a full consecutive tissue section was analyzed
using MALDI-2, which enabled the ion distribution to be studied throughout
the tissue (Figure 4E,H). The identity of the drug has been validated by MS/MS and high
mass resolution experiments (data not shown). In addition to the drug
distribution signal, numerous endogenous lipid compounds were also
observed, including a variety of species not observed with MALDI (the
full mass range spectrum is provided in Supporting Information, Figure 9). For example, the [M + H – H2O]+ ion of cholesterol observed at m/z 369.3521 (0.2 ppm mass error) was observed throughout
the entire tissue, but with higher ion intensities in the lesions
(Figure 4F). The ability
of MALDI-2 to access direct photoionization channels was demonstrated
as well as for the radical cation of vitamin E at m/z 430.3812 (Figure 4G). This ion signal was observed at far lower intensity
in the lesions compared to the surrounding tissue when compared to
stained tissue (Figure 4G,H).

Link between MALDI-2 Increased Signal and Proton Affinity?
The above results confirm previous reports that MALDI-2 favors
the formation of [M + H]+ ions,34,35 presumably through a proton transfer process initiated by photoexcitation
of matrix molecules. If it is assumed that the source of the protons
in these aforementioned experiments is the same, then the gas-phase
proton affinity of the analyte species might be a key factor in dictating
the efficiency of the MALDI-2 process. To explore this, we calculated
the gas-phase proton affinities of each of the nine compounds for
which protonated signals were obtained and attempted to compare this
with the acquired MALDI and MALDI-2 data. For each compound, multiple
protonation sites are possible, and thus, we considered the site with
the largest affinity. The full list of considered sites and calculated
proton affinities is provided in the Supporting Information Figures 10 and 11, as well as the Supporting Information, Annex for more details.

No obvious
correlation was apparent between the calculated analyte proton affinities
and either MALDI-2 signal intensity or the fractional enhancement
of MALDI-2 over MALDI, suggesting the mechanism of protonation in
MALDI-2 cannot be explained by simple thermodynamically driven gas-phase
proton transfer (Supporting Information, Figure 12). This is perhaps unsurprising, as the mechanisms of even
conventional MALDI remain poorly understood and an area of active
discussion in the literature.46−51 It is possible that MALDI-2 is capable of protonating different
functional groups than conventional MALDI and that this contributes
to the observed signal enhancements. The coupling of MALDI-2 with
ion mobility to investigate the possible generation of different
protomer populations with MALDI and MALDI-2 could provide an exciting
avenue of future research to investigate such effects.

There
are several key differences between MALDI and MALDI-2 that
could potentially explain their ability to better ionize different
compounds. The higher energy photons used for MALDI-2 are sufficient
for direct two-photon ionization of matrix molecules, which is believed
to initiate the MALDI-2 ionization process. This is evidenced by the
≥2 order of magnitude increase in signal intensity for the
radical cation of the matrix monomer observed with MALDI-2 (data not
shown). By contrast, MALDI typically uses photons in the 337–355
nm range, insufficient for direct two-photon ionization of DHB52 and other common MALDI matrices. In this case,
photoionization of the matrix is thought to occur either by energy-pooling
processes or other complex mechanisms involving close interactions
between multiple matrix and/or analyte molecules.46 Second, MALDI is performed on a solid, crystalline sample
whereas MALDI-2 is performed on a desorbed, dense gas-phase matrix/analyte
containing plume. This likely presents a lower density reaction plume
than expected for MALDI. Moreover, in light of the above results it
is possible that proton transfer rates in the still relatively dense
MALDI plume ionized by MALDI-2 are not dictated by gas-phase PA values.
Moreover, there is no obvious correlation between the presence of
certain functional groups and the signal enhancements observed using
MALDI-2. Combined with the likelihood of complex cluster chemistry,
it is clear there is much to unravel regarding the similarities and
differences in MALDI and MALDI-2 ionization mechanisms and analyte-dependent
ionization efficiencies. Thorough evaluation of these parameters fall
outside the scope of this study.

Conclusions
The
present study reports for the first time that the detection
and imaging of many pharmaceutically relevant compounds can be significantly
improved using MALDI-2. We demonstrated that MALDI-2 can provide 1–2
orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and signal intensity
for a variety of model compounds. Importantly, this sensitivity increase
can negate the need for time-consuming derivatization protocols needed
for certain compounds. As such MALDI-2 provides a powerful a new tool
enabling the MSI analysis of a variety of compounds that are difficult
to observe with MALDI. It can offer benefits not only in the study
of drug metabolism and drug development, but also in studying the
effects of pharmaceuticals on endogenous metabolism by exploiting
the parallel increase in sensitivity provided by MALDI-2 for many
endogenous metabolites.34,35

As a first step
toward rationalizing the observed differences between
MALDI and MALDI-2 we investigated the correlation between analyte
proton affinities and the signal gain realized by MALDI-2 but no obvious
correlation was found. A solid understanding of the involved processes
in MALDI-2 ionization, allowing prediction of optimal use of MALDI
or MALDI-2, remains so-far elusive. Nevertheless, the examples clearly
show the huge potential of using MALDI-2 for improved sensitivity
and further research will focus on better understanding of underlying
processes to better exploit its abilities. Finally this work, in combination
with other recent studies31 highlights
the vast potential of postionization methods when coupled with modern
MSI technologies in overcoming the still low ionization efficiencies
of most compounds. Continued development and mechanistic understanding
of such approaches has the potential of further increasing efficiencies
by several orders of magnitude.
