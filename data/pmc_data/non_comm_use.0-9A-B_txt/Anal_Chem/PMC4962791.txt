The
acquisition of chemical information is a critical need for
medical diagnostics, food/environmental monitoring, and national security.
Here, we report an electrochemical information processing approach
that integrates (i) complex electrical inputs/outputs, (ii) mediators
to transduce the electrical I/O into redox signals that can actively
probe the chemical environment, and (iii) a redox capacitor that manipulates
signals for information extraction. We demonstrate the capabilities
of this chemical information processing strategy using biothiols because
of the emerging importance of these molecules in medicine and because
their distinct chemical properties allow evaluation of hypothesis-driven
information probing. We show that input sequences can be tailored
to probe for chemical information both qualitatively (step inputs
probe for thiol-specific signatures) and quantitatively. Specifically,
we observed picomolar limits of detection and linear responses to
concentrations over 5 orders of magnitude (1 pM–0.1 μM).
This approach allows the capabilities of signal processing to be extended
for rapid, robust, and on-site analysis of chemical information.

==== Body
Electronic devices such as radar
and sonar transmit signals with the goal of actively probing a physical
environment for dynamic information on the presence and motion of
objects. Analogous electromagnetic transmissions are also used to
probe samples for chemical information (e.g., multidimensional NMR
spectroscopy). In these cases, it is often useful to probe the sample
with complex signals and enlist sophisticated analysis (e.g., frequency
analysis) to enhance the extraction of chemical information. Despite
the capabilities, electromagnetic radiation has limitations in accessing
chemical information from complex samples, and it would be desirable
if chemical information could be probed through complementary modalities.
Electrochemistry is well-known for its capabilities to detect chemical
information with convenience, speed, and sensitivity, and electrochemical
inputs/outputs are also in a convenient format for sophisticated data
analysis (e.g., impedance spectroscopy).1−4 Here, we report that the capabilities of
electrochemistry can be extended by coupling electrical inputs with
redox mediators to transmit redox signals that are capable of acquiring
chemical information.

As illustrated in Figure 1, there are three features of our electrochemically
based
information processing approach. First, we assemble a redox capacitor
film at a gold electrode. As illustrated in Figure 1a, this film is prepared in two steps: cathodic
electrodeposition of the stimuli-responsive self-assembling polysaccharide
chitosan5−7 and anodic grafting of catechol.8,9 This
catechol-modified chitosan film is nonconducting but redox-active,
and it can readily exchange electrons with soluble redox-active species
that can diffuse into the film.10,11 Second, we add diffusible
redox mediators that bracket the redox potential of the catechol–chitosan
capacitor film (E° = +0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl). Figure 1b shows that for
this study we use two mediators: one mediator, Ru3+ (E° = −0.2 V), can undergo reductive redox cycling
to transfer electrons from the electrode to the film (i.e., to charge
the film) and the other mediator, Fc; E° = +0.25
V), can undergo oxidative redox cycling to transfer electrons from
the film to the electrode (e.g., to discharge the film).11 Third, we impose varying electrode potentials
to systematically drive either reductive or oxidative redox cycling
reactions. As illustrated by the thermodynamic plot in Figure 1c, an imposed reducing potential
is required to drive Ru3+ redox cycling, while an imposed
oxidative potential is required to drive Fc redox cycling. In terms
of function, (i) the electrode provides the electrical input/output,
(ii) the mediators transduce this electrical input/output into redox
signals that are transmitted throughout the film (and into the surrounding
solution), and (iii) the redox capacitor perturbs the redox signals
in meaningful ways to facilitate analysis of chemical information.

Figure 1 Electrochemical
signal processing approach to acquire chemical
information. (a) Fabrication of bio-based redox capacitor by electrodeposition
of chitosan and then oxidative grafting of catechol. (b) Redox mediators
serve to interconvert electrical-to-redox inputs/outputs and also
to transmit a redox signal from the electrode into the local environment
(e.g., into the capacitor film, where they engage in redox cycling
reactions). (c) Sequencing the imposed potential between reducing
and oxidizing voltages can selectively engage reductive and oxidative
redox cycling to generate information-rich signature patterns.

To test this electrochemically
based information processing approach,
we used biothiols as our model system for two reasons. First, biothiols
are important for redox homeostasis, and thus measurements of biothiols12−14 may facilitate understanding and control of the oxidative stresses
that contribute to a range of human maladies.15−17 For instance,
some biothiols (i.e., glutathione) are important natural antioxidants18,19 and are putative biomarkers of oxidative stress,20 while other biothiols (e.g., N-acetylcysteine)
have been suggested for therapeutic interventions.21−23 The second
reason for studying biothiols as a model is that the chemical properties
of thiols are reasonably well understood, and thus biothiols provide
an opportunity to illustrate how electrical inputs can be tailored
to probe for specific chemical information.

Experimental Section
Electrodeposition
of Chitosan
A chitosan solution (∼1.5%
w/w) was prepared by adding chitosan flakes (from crab shells, 85%
deacetylation, Sigma–Aldrich) to water and slowly stirring
in 1 M HCl to dissolve the chitosan (final pH 5.5). After overnight
mixing, the solution was vacuum-filtered through a porous glass filter
(∼40 μm pore size) to remove undissolved particles. Chitosan
solution (1% w/w) was prepared by diluting the 1.5% chitosan solution
with deionized (DI) water and filtering it through a 5 μm syringe
filter. The gold working electrode (2 mm diameter; CH Instruments,
Austin, TX) was first cleaned with piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2, 7:3 v/v) for 15 min and
washed thoroughly with DI water, followed by drying under N2 stream. The clean electrode was immersed in chitosan solution (1%
chitosan, pH 5.5) and connected to the power source (2400 Sourcemeter,
Keithley) with alligator clips, and the gold electrode was biased
to serve as the cathode (4 A/m2, 45 s) while a platinum
wire served as the counter electrode. After electrodeposition, the
chitosan-coated electrode was removed from the deposition solution
and rinsed with DI water. After drying, these films were observed
to be approximately 200 nm thick.

Electrochemical Grafting
of Catechol onto Chitosan
Grafting is achieved by immersing
the chitosan-coated electrode in
a catechol-containing solution (5.0 mM in 0.1 M phosphate buffer;
pH 7.0) and applying an anodic potential to the underlying electrode
(0.5 V, 5 min). After reaction, the catechol–chitosan-coated
electrode is sonicated for 3 min and washed extensively with water.

Electrochemical Measurements
Measurements were performed
on a CHI6273C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Austin, TX)
with three-electrode configurations with Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as a reference
electrode and Pt wire as an auxiliary electrode.11 Solutions were degassed with nitrogen for about 30 min
before electrochemical measurement, and during the measurement a stream
of nitrogen was gently blown over the surface of the solution. Typically,
the catechol–chitosan-coated gold electrode was stabilized
by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans from −0.4 to 0.4
V (vs Ag/AgCl) at a rate of 0.05 V/s in a buffered solution (0.1 M
phosphate, pH 7.0) containing the 1,1′-ferrocenedimethanol
(Fc) and Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (Ru3+) mediators (50 μM each) for at least 100 cycles.

X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis 165
spectrometer with a monochromatic A1 Kα (1486.7 eV) X-ray source.
Peak fittings were performed with CasaXPS software, and a Shirley-type
background was applied to all spectra.

Results
Initial Studies
with Gold Electrode
Initial studies
were performed with glutathione (GSH) and an uncoated gold electrode
to demonstrate two unusual features of biothiols. First, direct electron
transfer from biothiols is often kinetically unfavorable.24,25 This unfavorable electron transfer is illustrated in Figure 2a, which shows cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) for GSH (10 μM in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) when
the imposed potential was cycled between −0.4 and +0.4 V (vs
Ag/AgCl; scan rate 50 mV/s). CV results for this GSH control show
no discernible oxidation or reduction peaks for GSH, which is consistent
with the difficulty in promoting its electron exchange. Because of
this difficulty, electrochemical methods to detect GSH often use mediators26−28 and nanocomponents29,30 to promote the electron transfer
that generates an electrical signal.

Figure 2 Challenges for electrochemical analysis
of thiols. (a) Cyclic voltammograms
for glutathione (GSH; 10 μM) with gold electrode show no obvious
oxidation or reduction peaks, consistent with observations that thiols
do not readily exchange electrons. (b) Thiols can self-assemble on
gold and potentially attenuate electrochemical signals. (c) Input–output
curves show progressive attenuation of Fc oxidation, presumably because
GSH self-assembly blocks the gold electrode. (d) GSH attenuation of
Fc oxidation is not reversed by replacing the electrode in fresh Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution.

A second feature of thiols is their well-known ability to
self-assemble
onto gold,31−33 and this self-assembly can block the electrode and
attenuate electrochemical measurements, as suggested in Figure 2b.34−37 Signal attenuation was observed
when we supplemented the buffered solution of GSH (10 μM) with
Fc–Ru3+ mediators (50 μM each). The results
are shown as either CV curves (Figure 2a) or input–output curves (Figure 2c), and both representations
show that the Fc oxidation peak decreases monotonically with each
successive cycle. We hypothesize that this attenuation in Fc oxidation
is due to self-assembly of GSH on gold. Surprisingly, we did not observe
consistent attenuation in the Ru3+ reduction or Ru3+ oxidation regions of the signal.38,39 (Note: Control studies in Figure S1 in
Supporting Information show no signal attenuation by GSH when electrochemical
measurements were made with indium tin oxide-based electrodes.)

We further tested the reversibility of GSH attenuation of the Fc
oxidation current. In this experiment, we first performed CV with
the gold electrode in buffered solutions of GSH (10 μM) and
the Fc–Ru3+ mediators for 24 cycles, and then we
removed and rinsed the gold electrode before replacing it in GSH-free
solution of Fc–Ru3+ mediators. Figure 2d shows results for the first
and last cycles in the GSH solution, again showing attenuation of
Fc oxidation. After the electrode was rinsed and tested in Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution, the CV results in Figure 2d indicate that Fc oxidation currents remain
attenuated. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that GSH
self-assembly onto the gold electrode attenuates the signal and this
gold–thiol bond is sufficiently stable that it is not reversed
by simple rinsing.

Chemical evidence to support the hypothesis
that GSH self-assembles
onto the gold electrode was provided by XPS. Specifically, samples
were prepared by immersing a gold-coated silicon wafer into Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution (50 μM each in 0.1 M phosphate,
pH 7.0) containing various amounts of GSH (10 nM–100 μM)
and scanning from −0.4 to +0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) at a rate of
0.05 V/s for 25
cycles. The gold chip electrodes were then sonicated in DI water for
3 min to remove unbound GSH, followed by drying under a stream of
nitrogen. Figure 3a
shows high-resolution XPS spectra of a sample prepared with 10 μM
GSH in the mediator solution. These spectra and the corresponding
components in C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and S 2p regions confirm the assembly
of glutathione on gold surface. Furthermore, we calculated the atomic
ratios of N 1s/Au 4f and C 1s/Au 4f and plotted them as a function
of GSH concentration. Results in Figure 3b indicate that as the GSH concentration
in the solution increased, more GSH was assembled onto the gold surface.
(CV scans for sample preparation and a representative survey scan
are provided in Figure S2 in Supporting
Information.) These results provide independent chemical evidence
that GSH self-assembles onto the surface of the gold electrode, and
GSH’s self-assembly may explain the attenuation of Fc’s
oxidation currents.

scans for gold electrodes contacted with Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution containing varying GSH concentrations.

Amplified Detection with Catechol–Chitosan
Redox Capacitor
We next examined the response for a gold
electrode coated with
the catechol–chitosan redox capacitor. Two controls in Figure 4 are catechol–chitosan
films tested in the absence of mediators (with and without GSH). The
results from these controls show no discernible oxidation or reduction
currents in the presence or absence of GSH (10 μM). When the
catechol–chitosan film was tested with both the Fc and Ru3+ mediators, the results in Figure 4 show strong Fc oxidation and Ru3+ reduction peaks, consistent with the redox cycling mechanisms in Figure 1b.

Figure 4 Amplification of mediator
currents by catechol–chitosan
redox capacitor. CVs for controls show small currents for the redox
capacitor in the absence of Fc–Ru3+mediators.

The gold electrode with the catechol–chitosan
redox capacitor
film was next evaluated in the presence of GSH (10 μM) and Fc–Ru3+ mediators for multiple cycles. Figure 5a shows the CVs and Figure 5b shows the input–output curves for
this experiment. There are two observations apparent from these results.
First, comparison of the initial and final CVs for the redox capacitor
shows a considerable attenuation in Fc oxidation currents. This observation
is consistent with the results from Figure 2, which suggest that GSH’s self-assembly
onto gold attenuates the Fc oxidation currents. Second, a comparison
of the results from the electrode coated with redox capacitor and
the uncoated gold electrode show a considerable amplification in Fc
oxidation and Ru3+ reduction currents. Signal amplification
for the redox capacitor is attributed to the redox cycling mechanisms
of Figure 1b.

Figure 5 Amplified and
attenuated Fc oxidation in the presence of GSH and
Fc–Ru3+ mediators: (a) CVs and (b) input–output
curves over multiple cycles. (c) The signal is quantified as charge
transfer during the Fc oxidation portion of the cycle. (d) Summary
of results showing that Fc oxidation is amplified by the catechol–chitosan
capacitor and attenuated in the presence of GSH.

Figure 5c
shows
that the output signal is quantified by integrating the current (i) for the Fc oxidation region of the CV to determine the
charge transfer (Q) during this portion of the cycle. Figure 5d summarizes results
from these experiments. The attenuated response for the catechol–chitosan
film tested with GSH and Fc–Ru3+ mediators is shown
as monotonically decreasing oxidative charge transfer with each progressive
cycle. No such attenuation was observed for a control catechol–chitosan
film tested in Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution lacking
GSH. Furthermore, no attenuation was observed for a control in which
the catechol–chitosan film was tested in Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution containing a high concentration of oxidized GSSG
(100 μM). Finally, Figure 5d shows results for the uncoated gold electrode incubated
in the presence of GSH: the signal is attenuated over progressive
cycles (see inset) but the signal is considerably lower than that
from the catechol–chitosan film.

Hypothesis Testing
The traditional limitation of analytical
electrochemistry is selectivity: while signals can be detected quickly
and with high sensitivity, these signals often contain information
on various chemical species and it is generally difficult to deconvolute
this information. We suggest that an underutilized capability of electrochemistry
is the use of complex and tailored inputs to probe for information
relevant to a specific hypothesis. For instance, in this study we
hypothesize that signal attenuation is due to GSH self-assembly onto
the gold electrode. If this hypothesis is true, then it should be
possible to use an imposed reducing potential to reverse the gold–thiol
bond and desorb the thiol.40−43 Experimentally, we tested the catechol–chitosan
film with GSH (10 μM) in Fc–Ru3+ mediator
solution and repeatedly imposed cyclic inputs (15 cycles) followed
by a step reducing potential.

Figure 6a shows the details for a single sequence.
During the cyclic imposed potential, Fc oxidation was observed to
be attenuated. After 15 cycles, a step change was then imposed in
the input voltage for 5 min to test the hypothesis that a reducing
potential could reverse the attenuation. The right plot in Figure 6a shows that, during
the 8–13 min time period in which the reducing potential was
imposed, a reductive charge was drawn. After this reducing step, the
solution was retested by a cyclic potential input. Figure 6b shows the input (E) and output curves (i or Q) along with CV representations of this experiment. These results
show that, after imposition of a step reducing potential, the Fc oxidation
recovered its preattenuated levels but was subsequently reattenuated
upon progressive cycles. As indicated in Figure 6b, this procedure of alternating between
cyclic and step reducing potentials was repeated multiple times. It
should be noted that, during the 1.5 h experiment in Figure 6b, the electrode was never
removed and the solution was never changed, and thus the reproducibility
of the observed responses should enable a more rigorous probing of
a sample to identify reproducible signals. The results in Figure 6b show the Fc oxidation
signal was repeatedly attenuated upon multiple cycles but could be
repeatedly recovered by a step reducing potential capable of desorbing
thiols from gold.

Figure 6 Tailored electrical input sequence to test the hypothesis
that
GSH self-assembly on gold attenuates Fc oxidation. (a) Input–output
for the first sequence: during the initial 15 cycles (0–8 min),
attenuation is observed, after which a step reductive potential is
imposed (−1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl; 8–13 min) to induce GSH’s
reductive desorption. (b) Repeating the input–output sequence
shows a repeated attenuation of Fc oxidation and regeneration of the
signal, consistent with GSH self-assembly and reductive desorption.

Quantitative Information
Acquisition
Electrochemistry
is well-known for its high sensitivity and large dynamic range, which
facilitates quantitative analysis. Here, we utilize the signal amplification
of redox capacitor and GSH-associated attenuation of Fc oxidation
to quantify chemical information. For this analysis, we started by
immersing a gold electrode coated with the catechol–chitosan
redox capacitor film into Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution
(3.0 mL) and then imposed a cyclic potential (from −0.4 to
+0.4 V) for 25 cycles. The initial signal ([GSH] = 0) in Figure 7a shows the Fc oxidative
charge transfer becomes stable after the first cycle and remains constant
for the remaining 24 cycles. Next, an aliquot (30 μL) of solution
containing GSH, Fc, and Ru3+ was added to the mediator
solution and the CV scan was resumed for an additional 25 cycles. Figure 7a shows that the
addition of 10–12 M GSH resulted in finite attenuation
of Fc oxidative charge transfer. This experimental procedure was repeated
by adding progressively higher GSH concentrations (up to 10–5 M). Figure 7a shows
that Fc oxidative charge transfer is attenuated after each GSH addition. Figure 7b shows CV representation
for the experiment (25th cycle), which also shows the increasing attenuation
with increasing GSH concentration. (Note: The electrode was never
removed from the solution during this 2.5 h experiment, and the potential
input and current output curves for this experiment are shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information.)

analysis of GSH signal attenuation. (a) Progressive
attenuation of Fc oxidation with addition of increasing GSH concentrations.
(b) CV representations show attenuation of Fc oxidation. (Input–output
curves for this experiment are provided in Figure S3 in Supporting Information.) (c) Fc oxidative charge transfer
(average of the last five cycles) for each GSH concentration. (d)
Normalized signal attenuation is linear over 5 orders of magnitude
in GSH concentration.

For quantitative analysis, we averaged the Fc oxidative charge
transfer for the last five cycles for each GSH concentration. Figure 7c shows the progressive
decrease in charge transfer with increasing GSH concentration, consistent
with the hypothesis that GSH self-assembly is responsible for signal
attenuation. Figure 7d is a semilogarithmic plot of normalized signal attenuation, (Q0– Q)/Q0, as a function of GSH concentration (where Q0 is obtained from the initial Fc–Ru3+ mediator solution; [GSH] = 0). Figure 7d shows this semilogarithmic relationship
is linear over 5 orders of magnitude from 1 pM to 0.1 μM [the
error bars provided in Figure 7 are difficult to see because they are comparable to the symbol
size; details of the limit of detection (LOD) calculation are provided
in Supporting Information].

Figure 8 shows that
the quantitative analysis can be extended to the other biothiols cysteine,
homocysteine, and N-acetylcysteine. Again, the semilogarithmic
relationship is linear over 5 orders of magnitude.

Discussion
We believe the novel
feature of this electrochemical information
processing approach is the integration of three emerging capabilities.
First is the use of redox mediators that allow electrical inputs to
be transduced into diffusible redox “signals” that can
be transmitted from the electrode into the local environment (into
the film and external solution). Diffusible redox mediators have been
shown to be capable of performing various functions for enzyme biosensing,44 environmental remediation,45−47 energy harvesting
(e.g., microbial fuel cells),48 bioelectrosynthesis,45,49 and actuation of molecular machinery.50−52 More recently, mediators
have emerged as a novel means to probe for ill-defined information:
to detect signatures of biological redox activities53 or to understand the properties of complex materials.54−58 Here, we extend the use of mediators for acquiring information.

The second feature integrated in this work is application of the
catechol-based redox capacitor, which offers several important information-processing
capabilities.59,60 The permeability of the capacitor
film allows a sampling of the local environment (biothiols can diffuse
through the film). The catechol moieties allow redox connectivity,
as they can be rapidly and repeatedly switched between oxidized and
reduced states.10,11 Importantly, catechol’s
electron-exchange capabilities are rather nonspecific, as they can
donate and accept electrons with a range of oxidants and reductants
(including those relevant to biology).61 These nonspecific redox interactions means that the capacitor’s
information processing capabilities may be generic and allow information
to be sampled at a global systems level (versus molecule-specific
level).53 Furthermore, the catechol moieties
can undergo reversible binding (i.e., chelation) interactions62 that can alter redox activities, and this provides
opportunities for novel analytical methods (e.g., amplified displacement
assays).63 Here, the capacitor’s
redox cycling reactions amplify mediator currents and allow enhanced
sensitivity,64,65 while biothiol self-assembly
on the gold electrode leads to an attenuation of the signal. Figures 7 and 8 show that these modifications to the signal enable biothiols
to be quantified over 5 orders of magnitude in concentration.

The third feature integrated in this study is the use of complex
electrical inputs to generate interpretable response signals. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy also uses complex electrical inputs to access
information. Traditionally, impedance-based approaches use sinusoidal
inputs and outputs and apply mathematics from signal processing to
relate frequency-dependent changes to underlying physicochemical properties.
Often these impedance measurements are fit to an equivalent circuit
model to characterize the electrical properties of an interface. There
is a growing appreciation that such electrochemical impedance measurements
could offer transformational capabilities for accessing chemical information:
electrochemical methods are rapid, sensitive, and portable, while
signal processing methods offer the possibility of extracting information
from complex and noisy samples.66−70 There is considerable recent research to extend impedance methods
(e.g., broadband approaches) to allow more rapid measurement (e.g.,
to balance speed and accuracy) and to evaluate/accommodate the inherent
nonlinear and nonsteady nature of electrochemical signals. Here, we
focused on extracting information at a single frequency (i.e., a single
scan rate), imposed no mathematical assumptions or models, and analyzed
the nonsinusoidal morphology of the output signal (i.e., results are
quantified with the Fc oxidative charge transfer Q). In the long term, we envision that coupling of methods—analysis
of signal morphology and the frequency dependence of morphology changes—will
provide complementary capabilities to maximize the extraction of chemical
information.

While the focus of this paper is to demonstrate
that the integration
of mediators, redox capacitor, and input potential sequences can offer
new opportunities to acquire chemical information, we can speculate
why we think these new opportunities may be important. First, the
mediator–capacitor–electrode interactions generate steady
amplified output signals over multiple hours, and the chemical information
being probed for (biothiols) appears as a perturbation (attenuation)
to these signals. Potentially, repetitive measurements and perturbations
may enhance the measurement reliability. Specifically, we report high
sensitivities (picomolar) and a large dynamic range (linear over 5
orders of magnitude in concentration), while initial studies with
the 20 amino acids suggest opportunities for improved selectivities,
as only cysteine (the only biothiol amino acid) was capable of signal
attenuation (Figure S7 in Supporting Information).
Second, the system of mediators, redox capacitor, and input potential
sequences can be “tuned” to enhance the acquisition
of chemical information. For instance, mediators interact with the
sample, the capacitor, and the electrode, and different mediators
with different characteristics have been shown to access different
chemical information.55 In addition to
tuning the mediators, the electrode’s input signal can be tailored
to probe for evidence of specific interactions (e.g., gold–thiol
self-assembly). Furthermore, it may be possible to create redox capacitors
with different properties that can probe different redox windows.
Third, the signal processing approach described here may expand the
capabilities of electrochemistry for emerging opportunities and needs.
The most obvious emerging opportunity is to extend the immense signal
processing capabilities of microelectronics to the acquisition and
processing of chemical information. The most obvious emerging need
is in redox biology, where important concepts such as oxidative stress
remain difficult to define, and growing evidence indicates that signal
transduction in redox biology may not follow conventional molecular-level
selectivity but rather atomic- (i.e., sulfur) level selectivity.71−73

Conclusions
In conclusion, this work demonstrates that mediators
allow complex
redox signals to be transmitted, and the redox capacitor modifies
these signals to enable the acquisition of chemical information. We
envision these capabilities will expand the use of electrochemistry
for rapid, sensitive, and on-site applications, both for quantitative
analysis and for the detection of qualitative global signatures of
complex ill-defined conditions (e.g., oxidative stress).
