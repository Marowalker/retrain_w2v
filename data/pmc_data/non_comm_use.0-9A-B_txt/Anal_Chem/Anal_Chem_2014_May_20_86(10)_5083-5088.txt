During
the deep reactive ion etching process, the sidewalls of
a silicon mold feature rough wavy structures, which can be transferred
onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel through the soft lithography
technique. In this article, we utilized the wavy structures of PDMS
microchannel sidewalls to initiate and cavitate bubbles in the presence
of acoustic waves. Through bubble cavitation, this acoustofluidic
approach demonstrates fast, effective mixing in microfluidics. We
characterized its performance by using viscous fluids such as poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG). When two PEG solutions with a resultant viscosity 54.9
times higher than that of water were used, the mixing efficiency was
found to be 0.92, indicating excellent, homogeneous mixing. The acoustofluidic
micromixer presented here has the advantages of simple fabrication,
easy integration, and capability to mix high-viscosity fluids (Reynolds
number: ∼0.01) in less than 100 ms.

==== Body
Effective
mixing of high-viscosity
liquids is important in many fields including chemical synthesis,1−3 biochemical reactions,4−7 and clinical diagnosis.8−14 For example, to study the functions of biomacromolecules in living
cells, substrates and enzymes/proteins need to be dissolved in high-viscosity
liquids and homogeneously mixed before the enzymatic reaction takes
place.10,15 In the context of clinical diagnostics,
high-viscosity body fluids, such as sputum,16 plasma,11 or semen,17 have to be mixed with chemical reagents and/or buffers
before performing analysis. In these applications, microfluidic platforms
offer many advantages such as small sample/reagent consumption, rapid
and high-precision analysis, and low-cost devices.18−20 On the other
hand, achieving effective mixing of viscous samples in microfluidics
is challenging due to the extremely low Reynolds number (high viscosity
and small channel dimensions).21−26

In the past decade, various microfluidic mixers have been
developed.
These mixers utilize passive approaches, such as diffusion driven27 and chaotic advection,28−35 as well as active approaches, such as thermal,36 optical,37 magnetic,38,39 electrokinetic,40−42 hydrodynamic,43,44 and acoustic-based45−53 mixing. However, few of these methods have demonstrated the ability
to mix high-viscosity fluids,54,55 and their performance
is often less than optimum. For example, Li et al. used a passive
mixer to mix high-viscosity solutions (the highest viscosity is 35.25
mPa s) with a low-viscosity borate buffer solution.55 The Reynolds number in this mixing device, when achieving
homogenous mixing, was reported to be 73.27. Wang et al. used an acoustic
field to generate and oscillate bubbles in circular-geometry channels
and induced mixing of water-glycerol solutions, but the mixing was
slow (mixing time: 2–4 s).54 In
this regard, it is essential to develop a new class of microfluidic
mixers that can achieve effective, fast mixing of high-viscosity fluids
with simple devices and experimental setups.

In this work, we
present an acoustofluidic (i.e., fusion of acoustics
and microfluidics)56−58 method that takes advantage of the wavy structures
in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels made from silicon molds,
which were fabricated using the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process.
Our method exploits the surface roughness of the PDMS microchannel
sidewalls to incept and cavitate bubbles in the presence of acoustic
waves to achieve rapid mixing of two viscous fluids with excellent
homogenization. It achieves fast, homogeneous mixing of high-viscosity
fluids (Reynolds number: ∼0.01) without involving any complex
device designs or experimental setups. With its simplicity and excellent
performance, the acoustofluidic micromixer presented here could become
a valuable component in many lab-on-a-chip applications.

Experiments
PDMS microchannels with a width, depth, and length of 240 μm,
155 μm, and 1.2 cm were fabricated using standard soft lithography
and replica-molding techniques.59 The microchannel
was treated with oxygen plasma and bonded onto a Petri dish. An acoustic
sandwich transducer with a diameter of 40 mm and a height of 55 mm
(APC, Mackeyville) was bounded onto the same Petri dish using epoxy
and placed adjacent to the microchannel. The transducer had a resonant
frequency of 120 kHz. Acoustic waves were generated by the transducer
driven by a function generator (Hewlett-Packard 8116A) and amplified
by a power amplifier (Amplifier Research 100A250A). The whole setup
was mounted on an inverted Nikon TE-2000U optical microscope stage.
A Nikon Intenselight C-HGFI light source with blue excitation filter
block B-2E/C (excitation filter wavelength: 465–495 nm) was
used for excitation. Different flow rates ranging from 1 μL/min
to 30 μL/min were used in the experiments. Deionized (DI) water
and fluorescein dye solution were first used for proof-of-concept
characterizations. Following that, PEG solutions (molecular weight:
∼700 Da) of various viscosities (21.2–95.9 mPa s) and
DI water were used in the mixing experiments. In all of our experiments,
the frequency and voltage applied were fixed at 38.9 kHz and 160 V
(peak to peak), respectively. Optimum frequency for mixing was found
by sweeping the frequency and observing cavitation behavior in the
channel. For high-viscosity experiments, the flow rate was fixed at
8 μL/min.

Working Mechanism
The operating mechanism of the acoustofluidic
mixing device is shown in Figure 1. The PDMS
microchannel is made from a silicon mold that is patterned by photoresist
followed by DRIE. The DRIE process achieves vertical etching via cycles
of etching of silicon and deposition of an inert passivation layer
to minimize lateral silicon displacement. The duration of each cycle
determines the roughness of the Si channel walls (shorter cycles result
in smoother walls). As a result of the DRIE process, the sidewall
of the silicon mold features wavy structures (inset in Figure 1a). These wavy structures of the silicon mold are
subsequently transferred to the PDMS channel by the replica-molding
process. The rough surface of the PDMS sidewalls develops voids when
a liquid is injected into the PDMS channel. These voids form stabilized
cavitation nuclei when an acoustic field is applied in the liquid.60 It was shown that the growth rate of microbubbles
depends on the size of the initial nucleation sites.61 Acoustic waves consist of compression and expansion cycles.
During the expansion cycle, the diffusion boundary layer of the bubbles
becomes thinner, and the surface area of the bubble gets larger. As
a result, gas is transferred into the bubbles from the surrounding
fluidic media. Depending on the flow rates and the viscosity of the
fluid, we have observed both steady and unsteady cavitation in the
devices. With low flow rates, bubbles frequently emerge and disappear
from the channel sidewall, suggesting unsteady cavitation. During
this process, bubbles grow in expansion cycles until they become unstable
and eventually collapse in the next compression cycle.62 The radius, Rc,
of a single bubble at the collapsing point can be approximated by
the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.63

silicon master mold. The wavy structures are transferred onto the
PDMS channel sidewall. (b) Cartoon representation of the mixing of
two reagents when the bubble along the sidewall of the microfluidic

via the bubble cavitation from the sidewall.

The left panel of Figure 2a shows
the modes
of a single-bubble collapse near a boundary. As the bubble collapses,
jetting and counter-rotating vortices occur. Versluis et al. estimated
the velocity of the jetting water to be on the order of 25 m/s from
the cavitation bubble generated by a snapping shrimp.64 The jetting phenomenon was used in applications such as
sonoporation and cavitation-mediated drug delivery.65 Zwaan et al. estimated that the center of each counter-rotating
vortex rotates at a rate of 10 000 rev/s.66 These fast-rotating vortices break the laminar flow, enabling
homogeneous mixing instantaneously. Figure 1b shows a cartoon representation of microfluidic mixing by bubble
cavitation from the channel sidewall.

Figure 2 (a) Unsteady cavitation (left panel):

360 000 fps. (c) Optical images of a bubble’s steady
cavitation captured at 5000 fps (i.e., microstreaming of a bubble
visualized by microbeads). (d) Simulated streamlines from theory.

At high flow rates (≥30
μL/min), steady cavitation
is prevalently observed. During this process, the bubble membranes
oscillate vigorously (both harmonics and subharmonics are observed),
which gives rise to microstreaming:67,68 pressure and
velocity fluctuations in the surrounding fluid (Figure 2c and d and the right panel in Figure 2a). The flow patterns in Figure 2d were obtained
using an in-house finite element code based on the perturbation approach
similar to that used by Köster.69 The streaming phenomenon breaks the fluidic interface and enhances
the mass transport of fluids, thus inducing mixing. It must be noted
that the perturbation approach is valid only for slow streaming70 and should not be used for quantitative comparisons
with the experiments that involve large amplitudes of acoustic radiation.
However, in the absence of numerical analysis of the so-called fast
streaming, the perturbation approach sheds light into acoustic streaming
phenomena for qualitative comparisons. At high flow rates, bubbles
do not collapse since higher acoustic pressure is needed to counterbalance
the rise in pressure associated with fluid flow inside the microchannels.

Results and Discussion
To demonstrate the inception and
cavitation of bubbles from the
PDMS microchannel sidewall, DI water was injected into the channel
using a syringe pump (KDS-210, KD Scientific). Figure 2b shows the top view of a bubble-collapsing sequence occurring
at the boundary. The bubble grew to a critical size of approximately
20 μm on the sidewall and then collapsed. The critical size
is defined by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation63 and gives the maximum size before the bubbles collapse. Along the
channel, as the bubbles collapsed, they were fragmented into tiny
bubbles. Due to the smoother surfaces of the top and bottom of the
microchannel, bubble inception or cavitation was observed only on
the channel sidewalls but not on the top or bottom surfaces. On the
basis of atomic force microscopic (AFM) images, the root-mean-square
(rms) roughness of the top surface, bottom surface, and sidewalls
of the microchannel was determined to be 2.2, 23, and 100 nm, respectively.
These results are congruent with the fact that the inception and cavitation
of bubbles were observed only from the sidewalls. They also agree
well with the report from Arora et al.,71 which demonstrated cavitation from the corrugated surface of acrylic
polymer particles and none from a smooth one.

To demonstrate
effective mixing, water and fluorescein dye were
injected at the same flow rates inside the microchannel. Figure 3a and b show the side-by-side laminar flow of two
fluids at 13 μL/min in the absence and presence of acoustic
waves, respectively. The mixing results were quantitatively studied
by measuring the gray scale values of the images, a good indicator
of the fluorescein dye concentration in the channel (Figure 3c). The dye concentration profile before and after
mixing was measured. The intensity profile shown in Figure 3c indicates no mixing of fluorescein dye and DI
water when the acoustic transducer is off. The average intensity of
the fluorescein concentration before mixing was measured to be 164.3
arbitrary units. Once the transducer was switched on, bubbles appeared
to incept and cavitate from the sidewalls, inducing rapid mixing (Figure 3b) and resulting in a uniform gray scale distribution
across the channel width (Figure 3c). Mixing
occurs via a combination of steady and unsteady cavitations. The average
intensity after mixing was measured to be 87.6 arbitrary units, suggesting
homogeneous mixing of the two fluids. The mixing time was estimated
from various trials using a fast camera (Fastcam SA4, Photron, at
20 000 frames per second) to be 10 to 50 ms.

plot across the channel width (vertical lines in a and b) before and
after mixing.

During the operation,
we also observed microbubbles moving along
the microchannel, which contributes to the mixing via microstreaming
and cavitation of smaller bubbles shooting into the fluid. In Figure 4, a bubble that was generated elsewhere in the channel
propelled with the burst of smaller bubble fragments. Depending on
the position of these bubble bursts, the bubble moved along the channel
in a certain direction. First, it moved upstream with an average velocity
about 58 mm/s (Figure 4a–c), then localized
with smaller-amplitude movements with constant streaming and cavitation
events (Figure 4d), and finally started moving
downstream (Figure 4e). These mobile bubbles
can enhance the mixing, especially in regions where bubble inception
is not frequent. In a bubble cluster, smaller bubble cavitations also
contribute to the mixing. Bremond et al. studied bubble–bubble
interactions and jetting behavior using an extended Rayleigh-Plesset
equation which shows that in the event of bubble cluster cavitations,
a jetting flow toward the center of the cluster was generated.72

Figure 4 (a–d) A microbubble is moving in the channel against
the
fluid flow via small fragmentations from the right side of the bubble.
(e) Acoustic streaming and further smaller bubble cavitations help
mixing, and then the bubble propels to the right by fragmentations
from the left side of the bubble.

The mixing performance of our acoustofluidic mixing device
was
further examined using various ratios of DI water and PEG700 solutions.
We measured dynamic viscosities of the PEG solutions (Table 1). For all the PEG solutions, the flow rate was
fixed at 8 μL/min. A 67% PEG-water solution (viscosity: 34.2
mPa s) was injected from one inlet and was kept the same for all experiments
(Figure 5a–d). The second inlet was
used for injecting varying concentrations of PEG solutions. Mixing
efficiency (M) was calculated according to the following
equation:55 1  where M is the mixing efficiency, n is the total number of points, Ii is the intensity at each point, and Im is the average intensity.
For the perfectly mixed fluids, M is 1, and for the
unmixed fluids, M is 0. A mixing efficiency of 0.9
or above indicates excellent mixing, and a mixing efficiency between
0.8 and 0.9 indicates acceptable mixing.55 Figure 5e shows mixing results for eight
different viscosity values (50–100% PEG concentration used
in the second inlet). As shown in Figure 5b–d,
two PEG solutions were mixed with very uniform intensity profiles.
Bubbles emerging from the sidewalls are also visible in Figure 5b–d. When we used 90% PEG solution with 77.3
mPa s (86.8 times higher than water) in the second inlet, a mixing
efficiency of 0.92 was achieved. Viscosity of the mixture of 67% (in
the first inlet) and 90% (in the second inlet) PEG solutions was measured
to be 48.8 mPa s, which is 54.9 times higher than the viscosity of
water (0.89 mPa s). The Reynolds number for the mixed fluids was calculated
to be 1.14 × 10–2, which is significantly lower
than the Reynolds number (e.g., 73.27 in ref (55)) reported in the previously
reported high-viscosity mixing studies.54,55 With 100%
PEG solution (final mixed viscosity: 55.8 mPa s), the mixing efficiency
was 0.88, and the mixing time was less than 100 ms. With its ability
to mix highly viscous fluids in microfluidic channels, our acoustofluidic
mixer can be valuable in many applications in chemistry and biomedicine.
For example, it can be used in sputum analysis for diagnostic purposes.
Clinical sputum samples from cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and other
pulmonary diseases have a viscosity ranging from 50 to 100 mPa s,73 which is at a similar range as those used in
our acoustofluidic micromixers.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated an acoustofluidic mixer that
can effectively mix two highly viscous fluids within 100 ms. The mixing
was achieved by using the surface roughness of PDMS channel sidewalls
to incept and cavitate bubbles in the presence of acoustic waves.
Large bubbles developed in the channel were found to be propelled
via small bubble cavitations, which also contributed to the mixing.
Mixing performance of the device was tested using a range of PEG solutions
with different viscosities, and the mixing efficiency was measured
to be 0.88–0.97. When 90% PEG (77.3 mPa s) solution and 67%
PEG-fluorescein (34.2 mPa s) solution were coinjected into the device,
a mixing efficiency of 0.92 was achieved. The viscosity of the mixed
solution was measured to be 48.8 mPa s (54.9 times higher than that
of water), and the Reynolds number was ∼0.01, which is 2–3
orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous micromixers.54,55 Our device is simple to fabricate, easy to operate, and can be conveniently
integrated with other microfluidic components. With further optimization,
we believe that our acoustofluidic micromixer has great potential
in many lab-on-a-chip applications such as medical diagnostics, nanoparticle
synthesis, microscopic sonochemical reactions, and biochemical reactors.
