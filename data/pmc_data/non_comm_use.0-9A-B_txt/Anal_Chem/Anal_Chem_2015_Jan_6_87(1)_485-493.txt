Infrared
(IR) spectroscopic imaging systems are a powerful tool
for visualizing molecular microstructure of a sample without the need
for dyes or stains. Table-top Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) imaging
spectrometers, the current established technology, can record broadband
spectral data efficiently but requires scanning the entire spectrum
with a low throughput source. The advent of high-intensity, broadly
tunable quantum cascade lasers (QCL) has now accelerated IR imaging
but results in a fundamentally different type of instrument and approach,
namely, discrete frequency IR (DF-IR) spectral imaging. While the
higher intensity of the source provides a higher signal per channel,
the absence of spectral multiplexing also provides new opportunities
and challenges. Here, we couple a rapidly tunable QCL with a high
performance microscope equipped with a cooled focal plane array (FPA)
detector. Our optical system is conceptualized to provide optimal
performance based on recent theory and design rules for high-definition
(HD) IR imaging. Multiple QCL units are multiplexed together to provide
spectral coverage across the fingerprint region (776.9 to 1904.4 cm–1) in our DF-IR microscope capable of broad spectral
coverage, wide-field detection, and diffraction-limited spectral imaging.
We demonstrate that the spectral and spatial fidelity of this system
is at least as good as the best FT-IR imaging systems. Our configuration
provides a speedup for equivalent spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
compared to the best spectral quality from a high-performance linear
array system that has 10-fold larger pixels. Compared to the fastest
available HD FT-IR imaging system, we demonstrate scanning of large
tissue microarrays (TMA) in 3-orders of magnitude smaller time per
essential spectral frequency. These advances offer new opportunities
for high throughput IR chemical imaging, especially for the measurement
of cells and tissues.

==== Body
Obtaining high-quality structural
and molecular information from biological samples is an analytical
challenge in many clinical and research studies. Traditionally, optical
microscopy or fluorescence techniques have been used with a variety
of dyes and labels to improve contrast, but these external contrast
agents can perturb biological samples and are limited to imaging known
molecular species. Vibrational spectroscopic imaging techniques, such
as using mid-infrared (IR) absorption, allow for the nonperturbing
molecular study of micrometer-thick samples. As many molecular functional
groups have resonant frequencies in this spectral range, the mid-IR
absorption spectrum provides image contrast as well as uniquely identifies
a sample’s chemistry without the need for dyes or prior analytical
knowledge of its composition.1 These factors
have led to a significant number of potential biomedical applications
of IR chemical imaging.2−7 Today, the most popular configuration for IR chemical imaging is
the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) imaging spectrometer which
employs multiplex detection of wavelengths via interferometry. In
its most common form, an interferometer is coupled to a multichannel,
liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The
detector in commercial imaging spectrometers is typically a linear
array (LA)8 or a focal plane array (FPA).9 FT-IR imaging instruments use a globar thermal
source, which has a broadband emission profile with sufficient intensity
for data recording but limits further improvement due to the trade-offs
between spectral and spatial performance.10 For instance, while larger format detectors with smaller active
elements could yield faster imaging, their implementation is difficult
as the total flux of the globar source must be divided among each
pixel. As the individual detector elements get smaller, the signal
decreases proportionally to the area of the detector, adversely affecting
the recorded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, due to the
nature of the interferometer, the scanning mirror must travel further
in order to increase in spectral resolution, which in turn requires
closing down the input aperture to maintain a certain level of collimation
of the beams passing through the interferometer arms. This dramatically
reduces the available flux requiring more sample coadditions to preserve
the SNR.11 Thus, commercial FT-IR instruments
are typically limited to ∼4 cm–1 resolution
with ∼5 μm pixels in order to ensure sufficient SNR from
the thermal source.12

Higher flux
sources can offer numerous advantages toward faster
high-definition IR imaging. The most dramatic example is the development
of high-definition imaging13 that provided
high quality data using a synchrotron source14 and significantly noisier data using a globar. The recent availability
of quantum cascade lasers (QCL) has now made the same advances feasible,
albeit in a discrete frequency (DF) configuration that contrasts with
the prevalent FT-IR and filter-based DF-IR technology.15 QCLs are a type of semiconductor laser commonly
packaged in an external cavity (EC) configuration with an approximate
200 cm–1 tunable range.16−18 In recent years,
they have become commercially viable in multiplexed configurations
spanning the fingerprint region.19 With
narrowband line widths at intensities unmatched by globar sources,
QCLs have been incorporated into DF instrumentation for chemical sensors,20−22 cavity ringdown spectroscopy,23 and analysis
of aqueous samples,24,25 as well as microscopy.26−31 This combination of QCLs with custom designed instrumentation for
microspectroscopy provides the unique option of collecting data sets
at high SNR. In implementations reported to date, however, the potential
of QCLs has not been fully realized. While an uncooled array detector-based
instrument was shown to be feasible and is now commercially available,
the challenge of using QCLs with high performance cooled FPAs has
not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using
high-performance, cooled FPA detectors with fast readout speeds in
conjunction with a rapidly tunable QCL. We first describe methods
to overcome challenges in instrumentation for this configuration.
Second, we compare the performance of our setup against commercial
high performance systems. Both high spectral quality (LA) and high
spatial quality (high-definition (HD) FPA) imaging spectrometers are
compared. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of using our approach
for biomedical tissue imaging.

Experimental Section
QCL Microscopy
We have developed a custom IR microscope,
as shown in Figure 1A, built for integration
with commercial QCL sources. The net magnification of the microscope
is 20× and 43× with effective pixel sizes of 2.02 and 0.95
μm, respectively, resulting in 259 and 122 μm corresponding
linear fields of view. While the setup is similar to conventional
IR microscopes, additional care must be taken during setup and alignment
to minimize back reflections which will appear as a flickering ripple
effect across the field of view. This behavior can be minimized by
slightly closing the condenser’s back aperture (AC) and the windowing aperture (AI). Beam shaping reflective optics, a pair of off-axis parabolic
mirrors (OAP) with 2× magnification, direct the QCL emission
to fill the back aperture of a 0.56 NA BD-2 glass (Ge28Sb12Se60) AR coated condenser (LightPath Technologies,
Orlando, FL, USA). The inverted transmission microscope uses interchangeable
BD-2 glass AR coated 0.56 and 0.85 NA objectives in conjunction with
a 250 mm focal length (FL) image forming mirror (F1). Planar
mirrors (M) are placed to direct the beam at small incident angles
to minimize the off-axis aberrations from spherical mirrors (F1 and F2). The intermediate image at AI is then focused with a 150 mm FL mirror (F2) onto a SBF161 128 × 128 pixel focal plane array (FPA) mercury
cadmium telluride (MCT) detector (Lockheed Martin Corporation, Santa
Barbara Focal Plane, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). These FPA MCT detectors
have microsecond response times that allow for scanning speeds far
faster than uncooled IR cameras that can only operate in the millisecond
regime. MCT detectors also have the highest noise-equivalent power
(NEP) ratings among broadband IR detectors which allow the instrument
to maintain sufficient SNR even in areas of lower QCL power output.
While uncooled FPAs and bolometers are available in much larger formats,
their readout rates are currently limited to standard video rates
of tens of frames per second and insufficient for implementation with
fast tuning QCLs.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic of the QCL-based wide field imaging microscope
configured
in inverted transmission mode. The microscope is coupled to a 4 chip
widely tunable QCL and a 128 × 128 FPA MCT detector. (B) Wiring
diagram showing the primary control components of the system (stage
omitted). The timing structure on the annotated trigger lines are
then shown (not to scale). (C) A generalized synchronization protocol.
The real-time wavenumber monitoring line output from the QCL controls
an external oscillator that triggers the FPA depending on the specified
spectral resolution and scan speed.

The microscope was paired with a widely tunable QCL source
(LaserTune
from Block Engineering, Marlborough, MA, USA) that contains 4 individual
QCL chips with a combined tuning range of 776.9 to 1904.4 cm–1 that can be scanned at up to 25 cm–1/ms with emission
powers between 0.5 and 15 mW. We have set the laser to pulse at 2
MHz with a 31 ns pulse width corresponding to a 6.2% duty cycle. The
sweep speed is limited by the maximum 1612 Hz frame rate of the FPA
(fFPA), the desired spectral resolution,
and number of in-scan coadditions. The wiring diagram of the various
control signals in the system is illustrated in Figure 1B. While sweeping, the laser outputs a TTL synchronization
pulse as it crosses every 0.5 cm–1 for real-time
wavenumber monitoring to correct for any nonlinearities in the tuning
grating motion (Figure 1C1). This is used to
trigger an external oscillator (Figure 1C2)
that either: (a) bursts NB pulses per
wavenumber trigger at the fFPA rate for NB ≥ 1 or (b) counts 1/NB wavenumber triggers for each pulse sent. The pulse train
from the oscillator is used to trigger the FPA frame grabber after
it is synchronized to the QCL’s pulse sync output (Figure 1C3). The sync output from this laser has a shark-fin
wave shape, so it is first threshold with a Schmitt trigger and then
combined via a logical AND gate with the pulse train from the external
oscillator (Figure 1C4). The FPA acquires a
frame when the trigger line is high; any additional triggers during
the integration and refractory periods are ignored. The synchronization
ensures that the laser fires an identical number of times within the
FPA’s integration period (Figure 1C5)
provided that the time jitter in the electronics is sufficiently small.
Finally, the data from the FPA is streamed directly to a RAID disk
array.

We have configured the laser to sweep across its entire
1127.5
cm–1 range at 0.38 cm–1/ms with
an oscillator burst rate of 1500 Hz. This allows us to acquire a 128
× 128 pixel image with 4512 spectral bands at 0.25 cm–1 resolution in less than 3 s. Several postprocessing steps are conducted
subsequently, especially to handle the noise in the QCL power output
(Figure 2). The sharp intensity fluctuations
in the 1500 cm–1 region, due to atmospheric water
vapor absorption, are minimized as much as possible by containing
the entire instrument within a nitrogen purged enclosure that brings
the air humidity to approximately 5%. Using custom scripts written
in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Nantucket, MA, USA), the dark current (IDC) is first subtracted from the raw FPA data
to get the AC signal (IAC) (eq 1). We filter the data using a low pass FFT filter
(FLP) with a sweep speed dependent cutoff
frequency of 15 Hz (eq 2). The spectral data
is then averaged by in-scan coaddition of every 16 bands (N) (eq 3), to yield a 4 cm–1 spectral resolution (Δv̅) data set
containing 282 bands. The same procedure is performed on both the
sample (IS) and background (I0) images prior to calculating absorbance (eq 4). The resulting single beam spectrum demonstrates
the improvement over raw data. 1   2   3   4  

Figure 2 QCL raw power output
is noisy when rapidly sweeping across the
spectrum (red). The recorded single beam spectrum is noise reduced
via postacquisition processes to yield a high-quality spectrum (blue).
The crossover frequencies for each QCL chip are indicated and result
in decreased signal intensity and increased spectral noise.

Our ultimate goal was to image
tissue microarray (TMA) sections,
which are standard tools for high throughput IR microscopy today.
To image tissue samples 1.1 mm in diameter with the available field
of view, we stitch a 5 × 5 or an 11 × 11 mosaic with a 10%
frame overlap for the 0.56 and 0.85 NA objectives, respectively. An
OptiScan microscope stage (Prior Scientific, Rockland, MA, USA) controls
sample positioning while frame alignment and offsets are calibrated
using an USAF 1951 optical resolution target. The adjacent frames
are then merged per wavenumber with a linear weighted edge blend over
the overlapping regions. Finally, the spectral images are processed
in ENVI+IDL (ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA) using
a minimum noise fraction (MNF) algorithm32 that removes the noise dominated principal components. The comparison
images illustrated in this manuscript are displayed using a linear
2% stretch, followed by color and scale matching in ENVI and ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

FT-IR Microscopy
Absorption reference images are acquired
using a Varian Stingray 620-IR imaging microscope with a 680-IR FT-IR
spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a Spotlight
400 FT-IR imaging system with a Spectrum One spectrometer (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA). The Varian is also equipped with a liquid nitrogen
cooled 128 × 128 pixel FPA. The microscope is configured with
a 0.62 NA reflective Schwarzschild objective and matching condenser
resulting in a total magnification of 40×. With image pixel sizes
of 1.05 μm, it requires an 11 × 11 mosaic to image 1.1
mm diameter tissue cores. Images were collected with 16 coadditions,
102 μs detector integration time, and an undersampling ratio
(UDR) of 4 where data points are acquired on every fourth zero crossing
of the FT-IR’s internal laser reference. Interferograms were
processed with a Blackman-Harris apodization function and then ratioed
to a 128 coaddition background. The final truncated spectrum is stored
with a 900–3800 cm–1 range at 4 cm–1 resolution. Images were stitched using the same weighted blending
method described previously as well as MNF noise reduced in ENVI+IDL.

The Spotlight instrument uses a 16 element linear array (LA) detector
to raster scan the sample. This instrument has a 15× 0.6 NA reflective
Schwarzschild objective and a 6.25 μm image pixel size. This
linear array is able to acquire spectra at higher SNR than an FPA
so data is taken with only 2 coadditions and stored using a truncated
750–3800 cm–1 region at 4 cm–1 resolution. In addition to MNF noise reduction, the data is also
corrected using PerkinElmer’s proprietary algorithm designed
to eliminate CO2 and H2O vapor contributions.

Sample Specification and Preparation
In this study,
we imaged an unstained breast tissue microarray (TMA) (BRC1501, US
Biomax Inc. Rockville, MD, USA) containing 148 cores of various stages
and grades of cancer placed on BaF2 substrate. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) stains of consecutive sections of the TMA were also imaged using
an Axio Imager.M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany).

USAF 1951 optical resolution targets were also imaged for system
characterization. Targets were patterned with SU-8 polymer (MicroChem,
Westborough, MA, USA) on a polished 1 in. diameter barium fluoride
(BaF2) substrate (ISP Optics, Irvington, NY, USA). The
substrate was first cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
and then rinsed with distilled water. A 5 μm thick layer of
SU-8 polymer was spun coat on BaF2 at 3000 rpm for 40 s.
The sample was then baked in two steps to harden the SU-8 polymer:
prebake at 65 °C for 1 min followed by a soft bake at 95 °C
for 3 min. A lithography mask was contact aligned, and SU-8 was exposed
to i-line UV radiation (365 nm) at 9 mW/cm2 for 10 s. After
baking at 65 °C for 1 min and at 95 °C for 1 min, respectively,
the SU-8 targets were developed in SU-8 developer for 1 min and rinsed
with IPA.

Results and Discussion
The performance
of the QCL microscope is demonstrated by imaging
SU-8, a photoresist polymer that has a distinctive spectrum with multiple
peaks throughout the fingerprint region, on an IR-transparent BaF2 substrate. It is patterned as a USAF 1951 resolution target
which is commonly used to test the resolving power of imaging systems.
Each group of bars, vertically arranged, contains 6 elements of decreasing
size where each successive group is half the size of the previous
one. The fifth group has features with sizes on the same order as
the incident wavelength. We use this target to serve as a well characterized
analog for tissue microarrays. Since both the tissue samples and SU-8
target are roughly the same thickness with features of comparable
size, this type of target allows us to test these imaging systems
under realistic conditions. The morphology of the sample has been
shown to affect the recorded spectra.33,34 Especially
when imaging with a coherent source where scattering and edge effects
can cause unwanted artifacts in both the spatial and spectral domains,
unstructured samples, such as commonly available chrome on glass targets,
would result in an overestimation of real world optical performance.
Furthermore, these target calibration images are 1.2 mm wide, and
the area coverage of groups 4 and 5 is similar to a single tissue
core. Through filtering, MNF processing, and mosaic blending, we show
that the background nonuniformity and image tiling artifacts are barely
noticeable which allows for clean large area TMA scans. To our knowledge,
this data quality has not previously been reported.

The QCL
microscope was configured to scan the SU-8 BaF2 target
at 4 cm–1 spectral resolution across the
fingerprint region 776.9 to 1904.4 cm–1. The same
target was imaged using the two FT-IR instruments to serve as a standard
for comparison. Here, in Figure 3A, we see
a selection of images from the full spectral data set representing
SU-8 polymer on an absorbing peak at 1248 cm–1.
On a nonabsorbing wavenumber at 1552 cm–1 on the
spectral baseline, we see minimal absorbance and only intensity due
to edge scattering from features on the sample. The QCL microscope,
however, surpasses both the FT-IR systems in terms of resolving power
as shown by Figure 3B. These images show the
absorbance of the sixth element of group 5 at 1248 cm–1, marked by the red arrows in Figure 3A. Alongside
each image is the vertical absorbance profile of the horizontal set
bars, marked by the red line. Each bar is 8.77 μm wide, which
is approximately the same width as the incident wavelength. An interesting
feature is clearly visible in the high magnification QCL image. Scattering
from the edges of the SU-8 bar results in a loss in energy that is
manifested as a sharp increase in the recorded absorbance at that
spectral element. This is quite similar to the images of edges as
seen in optical microscopy. The edge scattering is well-known in IR
imaging but is likely amplified here by the high spatial coherence
of the QCL source. As can be seen in Figure 3A, scattering-induced features are also present in the FT-IR data,
although much less pronounced. As the size of the bars decrease and
approach the wavelength of light, the scattering-enhanced edge signals
merge with the central absorbance values.

Figure 3 (A) SU-8 patterned USAF
1951 optical resolution target on BaF2 substrate imaged
with the QCL microscope and two commercial
FT-IR imaging systems. Images displayed are from an absorption band
(1248 cm–1) and nonabsorbing region (1552 cm–1). The resolving limit of each system is tested with
group 5 element 6 (red arrow). (B) Enlarged images of group 5 element
6 at 1248 cm–1, which has an 8.77 μm bar width,
with y-profiles across the horizontal set of bars
(red line) are plotted. Both QCL images are well resolved, the LA
FT-IR image is unresolved, and the FPA FT-IR images are at the threshold
of the Rayleigh criterion. (C) A comparison between the SU-8 absorption
spectra between the QCL and FPA FT-IR imaging systems at 4 cm–1 resolution. The white scale bars displayed in all
images are 100 μm in length.

The lateral resolution of each system is physically dependent
on
the diffraction limit. As per the Rayleigh resolution, the optical
system is considered diffraction limited if able to distinguish objects
separated by 0.61λ/NA. The two bars can be considered separable,
per the Rayleigh criterion, if the intensity dip between them is at
least 20–30% of the peak intensity. Furthermore, in order to
satisfy the Nyquist criterion, the magnification of the image must
be sufficient in order to achieve a spatial sampling rate at least
twice the Rayleigh resolution at all mid-IR frequencies.35 Both objectives on the QCL system are able to
clearly resolve these group 5 element 6 bar, reading near zero absorbance
levels between the bars. The effective pixel sizes of 2.02 and 0.95
μm, respectively, for the 0.56 and 0.85 NA objectives result
in a slight spatial oversampling at the lowest QCL emission wavenumber.
Neither of the other instruments has the same resolving power. The
bars are barely distinguishable when imaged by the LA FT-IR instrument
due to its larger 6.25 μm pixel sizes. The FPA-equipped instrument
has higher magnification optics with smaller 1.05 μm pixel sizes
and is just able to resolve these bars; the absorbance dip of approximately
26% is at the Rayleigh criterion threshold. While the spatial fidelity
using QCLs is seen to be excellent, as noted by us and other investigators,
a spectral examination has not previously been provided.

Maintaining
accuracy in the spectral domain of multiplexed QCL
systems is a nontrivial process. Unlike a typical broadband FT-IR
source which has a blackbody spectral profile and interferometrically
determined spectral scale, each QCL unit is only tunable to roughly
200–300 cm–1 around its center wavenumber.
When multiplexed together, depending on the manufacturer, these instruments
can span large ranges but also have areas of low signal strength between
center wavenumbers or discontinuities at crossover frequencies as
seen in Figure 2. Errors typically manifest
as low frequency baseline oscillations from laser pulse-to-pulse power
fluctuations or sudden absorbance spikes in the case of tuning mismatches
between the sample and background scans. In order to maintain spectral
accuracy during a sweeping scan across a large wavenumber range, the
switching time between QCL units, as well as the acceleration and
deceleration of each tuning grating, however small, should still be
accounted for. A simple interpolation to derive an image’s
corresponding wavenumber from acquisition timestamps by assuming a
linear tuning speed is not accurate. Therefore, the ability to monitor
the emission wavenumber in real-time with a TTL trigger output is
critical. This allows us to record the sample and background spectra
sequentially. If real-time monitoring is not available, the SNR drops
drastically in sweep mode; we have found that discretely stepping
through each wavenumber is more beneficial despite the significant
cost in scan speed.

One-hundred percent lines from randomly
selected pixels are shown
in Figure 4A for the linear array and FPA-based
FT-IR imaging spectrometers and the QCL-based DF-IR instrument. A
100% line is often used to estimate the noise in FT-IR spectrometers.
The use of the 100% is often to observe spectrum-to-spectrum consistency
(flatness of the line) as well as to estimate the spectral noise.
The response of the QCL-based instrument is flat but is significantly
noisier than the other two. Specifically, we observed ∼4-fold
higher noise for equivalent scans in the QCL system. Noise in the
100% line can be safely assumed to be the analytical noise at any
wavenumber in an FT-IR spectrometer as each spectral point contributes
to the noise at every point. Thus, temporal variance at a wavenumber
is the same as spectral variance around that wavenumber. The spectral
variance, however, is not a useful measure of the noise in a QCL-based
system at a given wavenumber. By averaging 100% lines from 1000 pixels
in Figure 4B, we see the noise in FT-IR imaging
systems is reduced according to the well-known trading rules of FT-IR
spectroscopy, but structure still remains in the QCL spectrum. This
shows that there is both a random and a shot noise component, which
also is not constant over the spectrum. This raises an interesting
question on how variance at each wavenumber should be quantified in
DF-IR systems, for example, to provide error bounds for measured absorbance.
We recommend extracting that data from a time series and calculating
the variance to obtain the error bounds. However, for static samples,
it is known that the absorbance is invariant and the use of filtering
techniques is well-justified (just as Fourier frequency bandpass filtering
is employed in FT-IR spectroscopy). Thus, the issue of characterizing
noise in a DF-IR system is much more complicated than the FT-IR case
and best examined in detail with methods to obtain high quality data.

Figure 4 (A) 100%
spectral lines extracted from randomly selected pixels
on the sample substrate for the three imaging systems, all normalized
to a single scan. (B) Averaged 100% spectral lines shows that the
source (shot) noise persisting in QCL systems does not result in the
same noise reduction as seen for the FT-IR (random noise) systems.
(C) Spatial root-mean-square (RMS) variation in the 100% line shows
that the random component of the FPA systems are the same while the
LA-based system is significantly less noisy. The noise in an FPA frame
from the detector is much smaller (FPA read noise), pointing to the
significant potential for improvement in QCL-based systems.

We recognize that the performance
of our system can be improved
significantly over this first prototype and efforts are underway to
do the same by a systematic analysis of noise. Here, it suffices to
state that the spectral and temporal domains, in contrast to FT-IR
spectroscopy, are not coupled. For any DF-IR spectrum, the spatial
variation of the 100% line is not affected by shot-to-shot noise.
Hence, we calculated the root-mean-square (RMS) absorbance for each
wavenumber as shown in Figure 4C. This should
provide the detector-dominated random noise for all cases. The noise
contribution of the FPA to both the QCL and FT-IR imaging cases can
be seen to be similar and both are significantly worse than the AC-coupled
and filtered linear array. Note that there is potential for improvement
as the FPA noise floor is significantly lower. Should innovative methods
be developed to improve the performance of the QCL-FPA system, it
may well rival the LA system’s performance. The data presented
in Figure 4C were all normalized for a single
scan and do not take the actual scanning time into account. These
numbers are simply raw performance measures and differences in optical
configuration, spectral range, and throughput need to be accounted
for to accurately compare per pixel performance. For each setup, hence,
we employ the typical experimental parameters (integration time, scanning
rate) we use for biomedical tissue imaging. Under the parameters specified
previously, a SNR of up to 260 was recorded for the QCL instrument
for a single scan while imaging each tissue core in a tissue microarray
(TMA) in approximately 2 min; in comparison, the FPA FT-IR spectrometer
achieved a calculated SNR of 727 (16 coadditions, 2.5 h/core), and
the LA-equipped system reached an even higher SNR of 1034 (2 coadditions,
1 h/core). Later in the manuscript, we discuss both the quality of
the data as well as the SNR and speed implications to acquire data
from tissue samples.

The spectra recorded by the QCL and FT-IR
systems can also differ
due to interference effects in using a spatially coherent source.
The scattered light from each sample point interferes with others
within a certain coherence area, thus encoding the sample structure
in the signal intensity measured by the detector. In Figure 5, we compare the breast tissue images acquired from
each instrument and examine the spectra from the marked location.
Each spectrum has been linearly baseline corrected and normalized
to the amide I peak at 1656 cm–1. We see that the
spectra are well-matched between the DF-IR system and their FT-IR
counterparts while the improvements in resolution are clearly evident.

Figure 5 Images
corresponding to the amide I absorption band at 1656 cm–1 from the C2 tissue core on the BRC1501 TMA are acquired
by QCL and FT-IR instruments. A brightfield microscopy image of a
Masson’s trichrome-stained serial section from the same core
is included. The 4 cm–1 resolution fingerprint region
spectra from a single pixel, baseline corrected and normalized to
the amide I band at the marked location on the images are compared
between each system. The scale bars represent 100 μm.

The advantage of the QCL instrument
is the ability of the DF-IR
system to scan through large sample areas quickly at single wavelengths.
Scans at a discrete frequency are only limited by the time it takes
for the microscope stage to reposition. For any biological sample,
multiple bands are required for tissue classification, so the limit
in imaging speed involves the retuning time of the QCL instrument
as well. To test the system for long-term consistency regarding wavenumber
tuning and pulse-to-pulse power output, we scan through all the cores
available on a breast tissue microarray. The full BRC1501 TMA was
acquired with the QCL microscope using the 0.56 NA objective (Figure 6A), resulting in a set of 55.3 Megapixel (9408 ×
5880) images for each of the 282 wavenumber positions. The full scan
area is approximately 1.5 cm by 2.5 cm so positional markers were
assigned to each core to skip imaging empty space. This specific image
is displayed at 1656 cm–1 on the amide I absorption
band. Each tissue core is 1.1 mm in diameter and is scanned as a 5
× 5 frame mosaic in about 2 min with our parameters. In total,
there are 148 tissue cores on this TMA, representing a scan time of
roughly 5 h. Three select cores are imaged at 2-fold increased resolution
with the high numerical aperture objective in under 10 min each (Figure 6B).

Figure 6 (A) Absorbance data of 148 tissue cores from the BRC1501
TMA acquired
by the QCL microscope with the 0.56 NA (2.02 μm) objective.
The net scan time of the fingerprint ranging from 776.9 to 1904.4
cm–1 at 4 cm–1 resolution was
approximately 5 h. Only the amide I absorbance band at 1656 cm–1 from the full spectral data set is displayed. Selected
tissue cores (C2, C7, G5) are also imaged by the (B) QCL with the
0.85 NA (0.95 μm) objective, (C) LA FT-IR (6.25 μm), and
(D) FPA FT-IR (1.05 μm). (E) A brightfield image of a serial
core section treated with Masson’s trichrome stain as performed
in traditional histological studies. The scale bars in all images
represent 500 μm.

The LA FT-IR instrument scans 1 core per hour but at a 10-fold
larger pixel size and a ∼4-fold higher SNR as noted previously.
As may be surmised, there is no simple way to compare these systems.
We believe each is suited to its specific use: the QCL system for
fast scanning at high spatial quality but limited spectral range,
the FPA FT-IR system for HD full spectrum imaging, and the LA FT-IR
system for collecting very high quality spectra. Nevertheless, it
is interesting to theoretically compare the systems by normalizing
performance as per the trading rules of IR imaging where the pixel
rate ratio (R) is proportional to the number of pixels
(n), the acquisition time (t), and
the resulting SNR.8  

Since SNR has a time-squared dependence, we can normalize each
of these benchmarks for equivalent SNR, implying that the QCL system
can provide the high quality of the LA system slightly faster (2-fold),
albeit with 10-fold smaller pixels and the smaller spectral range.
Hence, to a crude approximation, the QCL system can be approximated
to be ∼20-fold faster than a hypothetical LA FT-IR system.
For another comparison, the FPA FT-IR instrument scanned at a rate
of 2.5 h per core with an FPA representing a 75-fold increase in time.
When we normalize for the FPA FT-IR instrument’s 3-fold higher
SNR and its quarter pixel size, this implies that the QCL system is
still ∼2-fold faster per pixel in this case. These discussions
demonstrate that the QCL microscope provides us the option of fast
spectral scans at rates competitive with current FT-IR instruments.

The major advantage, however, of the DF-IR approach lies in the
reduced spectral scanning. Should only a few frequencies be required,
the QCL system advantage will increase proportionally. The line width
of our laser is less than 2 cm–1, and unlike FT-IR
systems, the spectral resolving power does not diminish with scan
time. The QCL data at 2 cm–1 contains ∼550
bands and is presented undersampled by a factor of 2 such that it
matches the 4 cm–1 resolution FT-IR systems. To
examine a single vibrational mode, the FT systems do have to collect
the entire spectrum whereas the QCL system will collect a single frequency,
raising its speed advantage further by ∼550-fold. This represents
a net speed increase of over ∼1100-fold per wavenumber over
the fastest available HD FT-IR system. A major shortcoming of present
QCLs is the truncated wavelength range. Should laser systems be developed
to cover the full midrange, it would only require 2-fold higher scanning
times. Thus, the analytical advantages of using QCL-based systems
are likely to persist. For scanning full spectral ranges, the advantage
will be significant but will be impossible to match by FT systems
for recording a few discrete frequencies.

We have demonstrated
an initial design for a chemical imaging microscope
employing a QCL source for DF-IR wide-field imaging. This QCL microscope
consists of three primary subsystems that must be developed in tandem
for optimal performance. Current implementations of multiplexed QCLs
are still in their first generation and could improve with respect
to wavenumber tuning range as well as power output and pulse-to-pulse
stability. With the higher flux of QCLs, this opens up the possibility
of cameras with larger pixel formats, faster readout rates, shorter
integration times, and deeper charge wells. MCT detectors, while being
sensitive, also have drawbacks in linearity and background. Linearizing
the photometric response of MCT detectors is likely to be important
to account for the strong intensity variations of QCLs, but we have
refrained from examining this for now. For conventional MCT detectors,
numerous strategies have been proposed,10,36 including
incorporating linearized preamplifier circuits calibrated for the
given detector.37 The optical performance
of QCL-based microscopes is limited by the lack of commercially available
high NA aspheric and achromatic microscope objectives in the mid-IR.
IR reflective optics are not well suited toward tunable laser sources,
and the majority of IR refractive optics are singlets prone to various
aberrations. AR coatings typically run from either 3–5 or 8–12
μm while broad band AR coatings covering the full mid-IR are
still limited to custom production optics. Innovations in optical
design will likely be needed and spurred by the emergence of DF-IR
microscopes. Lastly, a careful analysis of the data acquisition process
and data is required to develop new signal processing techniques to
handle the unique effects of laser coherence on the recorded spectral
data as well as eliminate noise.

Conclusions
In
our current implementation of the QCL microscope, the spatial
resolving power surpasses that of the best commercial FT-IR imaging
instruments while improvements in spectral quality have reached competitive
levels. The QCL approach offers higher speeds for scanning large tissue
arrays, but the nature of the DF-IR system is such that much smaller
times become accessible for certain types of measurements. The complexities
of working with a coherent source are ongoing issues, but the data
demonstrate little difference from traditional globar sources to a
first approximation. Using careful integration and postprocessing,
we were able to achieve ∼(1100/N)-fold speedup
for measuring the N essential spectral features of
tissue. This enabled very large images (>50 Megapixels) to be acquired
rapidly at high quality. These improvements in DF QCL imaging instrumentation,
combined with further ongoing developments, will greatly enhance our
ability to perform fast and efficient chemical imaging in cells and
tissues.
