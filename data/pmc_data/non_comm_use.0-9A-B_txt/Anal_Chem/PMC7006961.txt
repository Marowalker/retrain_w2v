We
introduce and compare two powerful new techniques for headspace
gas analysis above bacterial batch cultures by spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy enhanced in an optical cavity (CERS), and photoacoustic
detection in a differential Helmholtz resonator (DHR). Both techniques
are able to monitor O2 and CO2 and its isotopomers
with excellent sensitivity and time resolution to characterize bacterial
growth and metabolism. We discuss and show some of the shortcomings
of more conventional optical density (OD) measurements if used on
their own without more sophisticated complementary measurements. The
spectroscopic measurements can clearly and unambiguously distinguish
the main phases of bacterial growth in the two media studied, LB and
M9. We demonstrate how 13C isotopic labeling of sugars
combined with spectroscopic detection allows the study of bacterial
mixed sugar metabolism to establish whether sugars are sequentially
or simultaneously metabolized. For E. coli, we have
characterized the shift from glucose to lactose metabolism without
a classic diauxic lag phase. DHR and CERS are shown to be cost-effective
and highly selective analytical tools in the biosciences and in biotechnology,
complementing and superseding existing conventional techniques. They
also provide new capabilities for mechanistic investigations and show
a great deal of promise for use in stable isotope bioassays.

==== Body
Microbial metabolism is a complex
system of processes which requires interdisciplinary efforts to elucidate
the function of each component and its broader connections to the
whole system. Microbes consume and produce various chemical compounds.
An analysis of these metabolites is an important task in microbiology;
for example, it allows the study of metabolic pathways, microbial
activity, enzyme reaction mechanisms, and interactions with other
organisms and is essential to the optimization of industrial processes
in biotechnology. In this context, the study of the mixed sugar metabolism
of microbes and the resulting diauxie, where two exponential growth
phases are observed, is a very relevant topic. The classic example
of diauxic growth was first described by Monod after presenting Escherichia coli (E. coli) with a mixture
of glucose and lactose.1,2 Monod observed the biphasic exponential
growth of E. coli, intermittent with a lag phase
of minimal growth, due to the sequential consumption of glucose followed
by lactose. Glucose is the preferred carbon source for E.
coli as well as many other organisms.3 These microbes typically feed on other sugars only when glucose
is not present. The regulatory mechanism by which the expression of
genes required for the utilization of secondary carbon sources is
prevented in the presence of a preferred substrate is known as carbon
catabolite repression (CCR).4 CCR enables
microbes to increase their fitness by optimizing growth rates in natural
environments that provide complex mixtures of nutrients. On the other
hand, in industrial processes such as biofuel production, CCR is one
of the barriers to the increased yield of fermentation products.5 During E. coli glucose-lactose
diauxie, the presence of glucose represses the lac operon, a set of genes coding for the lac permease
and β-galactosidase which are required for lactose uptake and
lactose hydrolysis to catabolizable glucose and galactose subunits,
respectively.6

Optical density (OD)
measurements are commonly used to monitor
diauxic growth.1,2,7 They
rely on the principle that transmitted light is lost because of scattering
by the microbial culture. The OD is thus an indirect measure of the
concentration of microbial cells. OD measurements are simple, but
they suffer from interference because they cannot distinguish living
cell from debris, dead cells, or precipitates. The diauxic lag phase
between the consumption of the first nutrient and the second often
gives a distinct plateau in OD values due to the temporary halt in
growth. However, this classic picture of diauxic growth intermittent
with a lag phase is not always the case. Some strains of budding yeast
when presented with a mixture of glucose and galactose exhibit a very
brief diauxic lag phase and little change in growth rates between
glucose and galactose consumption.8 Furthermore,
although glucose sits at the top of the sugar hierarchy for E. coli and is frequently consumed first, mixed nonglucose
sugars may exhibit simultaneous metabolism rather than sequential.9 OD measurements alone cannot provide sufficient
information for mixed sugar metabolism. Another common method for
monitoring diauxic growth is sampling the microbial culture for high-performance
liquid chromatography analysis to determine changes in mixed sugar
concentrations during metabolic activity.10−12 Analytical
methods that require sampling are not ideal because they consume the
analyte and require extra considerations to prevent contamination
of the system.

The gas composition is another process parameter
frequently monitored
online in bioreactors. O2 and CO2 are two key
gases to consider.13 O2 availability
is a key parameter for aerobic bioprocesses as well as anaerobic systems
that are sensitive to disruption by O2, such as the production
of biohydrogen. CO2 is a key byproduct of both aerobic
respiration and fermentation and can be monitored to closely follow
these processes. Dissolved gases can be monitored by gas-sensitive
electrode-based sensors, some of which have the advantage of not consuming
the analyte. However, most sensors are invasive because they must
be submerged in the microbial culture and often have a limited lifespan
under the operating conditions of the bioreactor as a result of poisoning.
Online, solution-based sensors create challenges such as the requirement
for including an additional port on the bioreactor, an increased risk
of contamination, and the challenges associated with sterilization
and needing to frequently calibrate the sensor, which is often impossible
without process contamination. Disadvantages also include interference
with other components, aging, temperature dependence, and long response
and settlement times. The measurement of partial pressures in the
effluent headspace gases can give a good approximation of dissolved
gases via Henry’s law and eliminates the need to use invasive
devices. Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) are two
common methods of gas-phase analysis. However, both techniques require
sampling, are expensive, require frequent calibration, and have limitations,
including difficulties detecting certain components. Also, chromatographic
techniques rely upon the spatial separation of the compounds that
are being quantified and so are only of use on a noncontinual basis.14 Spectroscopic methods for gas-phase analysis
offer numerous benefits including high precision and accuracy, no
sampling necessary, and the ability to perform noninvasive real-time
measurements. Detection in the near-IR has the advantage of low-cost
light sources and detectors; the sensitivity, however, suffers from
low absorption cross sections. In addition, relevant homonuclear molecules
including O2 cannot be observed by IR absorption because
of the unfavorable selection rules. Molecular O2 has two
main absorption bands in its UV–vis spectrum: one deep in the
UV at 145 nm and the other at 760 nm.15,16 O2 detection at 145 nm faces interference by water vapor and CO2, and the weak absorption lines at 760 nm typically provide
detection limits that are of little practical use. Raman spectroscopy,
in contrast, can detect homonuclear molecules, but it has very low
sensitivity. Both near-IR absorption and Raman spectroscopy need special
enhancement techniques to be useful in gas-phase analysis.

Recently,
two new techniques were introduced for sensitive and
selective trace gas detection: near-IR absorption enhanced by photoacoustic
detection in a differential Helmholtz resonator (DHR)17−20 and cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CERS).21−25 In this article, we apply these techniques to the
study of the metabolic growth of microbes and compare their performance
and suitability for applications in the biosciences and biotechnology.
We demonstrate that both spectroscopic techniques can clearly and
unambiguously distinguish all of the main phases of bacterial growth,
can monitor the consumption of a mixed organic feedstock using 13C isotopic labeling of sugars, and can be employed to establish
whether the various components are sequentially or simultaneously
metabolized.

Experimental Section
The headspace
above bacterial cultures is analyzed by Raman (CERS)
or diode laser photoacoustic (DHR) spectroscopy. The CERS setup has
been described in detail before.21,23,24 Here, we provide a brief outline and describe some
modifications and improvements. A higher-power diode is employed (Opnext
HL63133DG), lasing at 636.7 nm. At full driving current, the laser
can provide up to 170 mW continuous wave (cw) power, but in CERS,
it is operated at a reduced power of 40 mW to facilitate single mode
operation. The laser output is coupled via a short-pass filter and
two Faraday isolators into an optical cavity composed of two highly
reflective mirrors (Newport SuperMirrors, R >
99.99%,
SM in Figure 1a). To
simplify the setup, no anamorphic prism pair or mode-matching lens
is used; mode matching/focusing into the cavity is achieved by optimizing
the distance of the collimating lens of the diode. If the laser wavelength
matches the cavity length, then an optical resonance builds up laser
power inside the cavity by up to 3 orders of magnitude, enhancing
the Raman signals (CERS). After the cavity, a dichroic mirror DM separates
excitation light from Raman signals which are coupled into a fiber
and transferred to the spectrometer (Shamrock SR-750-A with an Andor
iVac DR32400 camera at −60 °C). The 600 lines/mm grating
provides a 1200 cm–1 spectral range at 5 cm–1 resolution which covers CO2, O2, and N2 Raman peaks and can easily resolve 12CO2 and 13CO2 (Figure 2a). Part of the laser light
is diverted back to the diode for optical feedback, locking the laser
to the cavity. The diode injection current is modulated around one
cavity mode; in each cycle, the wavelength changes until it is self-locking
by optical feedback to a longitudinal cavity mode. In a simplification
of the setup, no attempts are made to actively stabilize the laser
because the optical self-locking is strong enough to keep accidental
resonances at duty cycles between 50 and 80%. To normalize Raman signals,
the N2 peak of air can be used because, in the closed system,
N2 is not consumed or produced by bacterial metabolism.
Alternatively, Si peaks presumably from the SM mirror and glass
substrates can also be used for convenient in situ calibration. The
Raman intensity is converted to partial pressure using tabulated integrated
peak areas.23

setups. See the main text for details.

aerobic metabolism (13C-glucose, 12C-lactose)
of E. coli. (a) CERS Raman spectrum of 800 mbar N2, 65 mbar O2, 73 mbar 12CO2, and 31 mbar 13CO2. (b) DHR absorption spectrum
(black) of 6.5 mbar 12CO2 and 5.0 mbar 13CO2. In blue and green are HITRAN data for 12CO2 and 13CO2, respectively.

The DHR setup has been described in detail in a
previous publication.20 In short, optical
absorption in a differential
Helmholtz resonator (Figure 1b) creates sound waves (the photoacoustic effect) in chambers
A and B, which are 180° out of phase. Acoustic noise, including
flow noise, will be mostly in-phase. Differential detection of the
sound in A minus B therefore doubles the signals and effectively cancels
noise. Two temperature-tuned distributed feedback (DFB) diode lasers
are used: a near-IR laser (Mitsubishi FU-650SDF, amplified to 30 mW
in a booster optical amplifier Thorlabs S9FC1004P) to detect CO2 near 1.57 μm and a red laser (35 mW, Eagleyard EYP-DFB-0764)
to detect O2 near 764 nm. To simplify the setup, the near-IR
laser is directed through one compartment (A) and the red laser is
directed through the other (B) (Figure 1b). In a typical experiment, CO2 is first
measured by scanning the near-IR laser; next, O2 is measured
by scanning the red laser.20 Both lasers
are modulated by their injection current at the acoustic resonance
frequency with a square wave at the 50% duty cycle. The near-IR spectrum
allows the distinction of 12CO2 and 13CO2 (Figure 2b). The photoacoustic signal is converted to partial pressure using
our previous calibration and HITRAN absorption cross sections.20,26

The molarity of a dissolved gas can be calculated from its
partial
pressure using Henry’s law.27 A
small proportion of dissolved CO2 will react with water
to form carbonic acid, which will be at equilibrium with bicarbonate
and carbonate ions, depending on the pH. With a typical acidic pH
below 5 at the end of an experiment, less than 1% of the dissolved
CO2 will be lost to carbonic acid and carbonates.

For each measurement, 50 mL of sterile LB (lysogeny broth, a nutrient-rich
growth medium) was inoculated with a single colony of E. coli (wild type, strain K-12 MG1655) and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C
to grow to typically 1.0 OD600 (OD at 600 nm in a 1 cm
cuvette). One milliliter of the suspension was then centrifuged to
remove the LB medium and resuspended in 250 mL of fresh, sterile M9
(a minimal, defined medium containing only essential salts and vitamins)
or LB solution. The medium was supplemented with d-glucose
and/or d-lactose (puriss. p.a., Sigma-Aldrich). For isotope-labeling
experiments, fully 13C-substituted glucose (U-13C6, 99%
CLM-1396, CK isotopes) was used. In mixed sugar experiments, we used
larger concentrations of lactose compared to glucose to show the preference
for glucose more clearly. This is in line with most previous studies
of glucose–lactose diauxie which have used a lactose concentration
that was up to 1 order of magnitude greater than the glucose concentration.28−30 The glucose concentration was selected to ensure that oxygen was
not depleted so that the shift to lactose metabolism could occur while
still producing appreciable CO2 from glucose metabolism.

The bacterial batch culture in a 500 mL flask was kept at 37 °C
in a thermostated water bath under constant stirring. The headspace
was circulated via a peristaltic pump (3 L/h) through the spectroscopic
cell in a closed, vacuum-tight system (Figure 1a). The total headspace gas volume is 720
mL in the CERS system and 510 mL in the DHR system. The transfer tubes
and cells were kept at ca. 45 °C using a heating wire to avoid
water condensation. This was particularly important and effective
for avoiding condensation on the high-performance cavity mirrors,
which would spoil their reflectivity. In control experiments, we measured
the appearance time from the suspension flask to the spectroscopic
measurement cell to be less than 5 min.20,24 To characterize
bacterial growth by measuring the OD in situ, another peristaltic
pump circulated part of the suspension through a 1 cm glass cuvette,
through which a red laser pointer (1 mW, 650 nm) was shining (Figure 1a). After calibration
with a UV–vis spectrometer, the transmitted intensity as observed
by a photodiode is converted to OD600. At the end of an
experiment and after exhausting the oxygen supply, the increase in
cell density is characterized by OD600 ≈ 1.5–2.0.
The final pH of the solution was typically 4.5 to 5.0 because of organic
acids generated during the metabolism. For comparison, fresh LB has
pH ≈ 6.8, and fresh M9 has pH ≈ 6.9. At the beginning,
the cellular material within the 250 mL suspension has a typical dry
weight of 0.2 mg, which by the end of a typical experiment increases
to 60 mg, reflecting bacterial growth. All experiments were repeated
at least three times, exhibiting essentially the same behavior.

Results
and Discussion
E. coli Metabolism in LB
or M9 Supplemented
with Glucose or Lactose
In the first set of experiments,
we studied the oxygen-limited growth of E. coli batch
cultures in LB or M9 medium supplemented with a single sugar, glucose
or lactose. Figure 3 shows typical time-dependent partial pressures of O2 and
CO2 as measured by CERS with simultaneous OD measurements
for E. coli in LB supplemented with 20 mM glucose.
Also included in Figure 3 (middle panel) is the total pressure p′total = pO2 + pCO2 + pN2 and the respiratory quotient (RQ), the ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed, where CO2 is
corrected to account for the approximately 18% of dissolved CO2 according to Henry’s law.27 After a lag phase of approximately 2 h (A in Figure 3), oxygen consumption and CO2 production
begin, indicating the onset of exponential bacterial growth (B in Figure 3). This is also indicated
by the increase in OD up to a peak value of about 1.5 in Figure 3, lower panel. After
around 5.5 h, the OD plateaus, indicating the onset of the stationary
phase (C in Figure 3). The living bacteria in the stationary population still consume
O2 and produce CO2. During exponential phase
B and stationary phase C, the oxygen uptake rate is constant, as indicated
by the almost perfect exponential decay fit of oxygen partial pressure
in Figure 3, with a
rate constant of k = 0.189 h–1 or
a half-life of t1/2 = 3.67 h. These results
are confirmed in three repeated experiments which show a lag phase
between 1.5 and 2 h, the onset of the stationary phase between 5 and
6 h, and an oxygen uptake rate within 0.15–0.19 h–1.

growth, stationary phase, and the end of aerobic respiration, respectively.
(Upper panel) Partial pressures of O2 and CO2, including an exponential decay fit of pO2. (Middle panel) p′total (total of N2, O2, and corrected CO2 pressures) and respiratory quotient RQ (ratio of CO2 produced
to O2 consumed). (Lower panel) Simultaneous OD measurements
of the bacterial culture.

During cellular energy production by aerobic respiration with glucose
as a carbon source, the sugar is oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Full conversion is described by the stoichiometry of eq 1 1  so that for each unit of O2 consumed,
one unit of CO2 is formed. For carbohydrates, the respiratory
quotient RQ is therefore typically about 1.0. Like OD measurements,
the RQ can be used to distinguish between exponential phase B and
stationary phase C as shown in Figure 3, middle panel, where a constant RQ of about 1.0 (within
2% in the three repeat experiments) is reached during stationary growth.
The 1:1 ratio between O2 consumed and CO2 produced
can also be observed in the constant total pressure during stationary
growth in Figure 3,
middle panel. A typical E. coli cell contains approximately
50% carbon by dry mass.31 Because sugars
are primarily used for energy production, the carbon source for biosynthesis
and growth in the LB medium originates from the tryptone and yeast
extract (see also ref (32)). E. coli has several oligopeptide permeases and
peptidases enabling it to recover free catabolizable amino acids from
tryptone and yeast extract.33 The available
oxygen in 1 atm of air in the 720 mL headspace of the CERS experiment
corresponds to 6 mmol, and the 20 mM glucose in the 250 mL suspension
corresponds to 5 mmol of glucose. According to eq 1, there is therefore an excess of glucose
in the experiment and the bacteria are limited by the oxygen available,
hence the decrease of O2 partial pressure down to essentially
0 in the closed system. After about 21 h, all available oxygen in
the closed system has been consumed, and aerobic respiration terminates
(D in Figure 3). E. coli is a facultative anaerobe, meaning that upon shifting
to anaerobic conditions, the microbes may adapt to the new environment
and resume metabolism by the anaerobic fermentation of excess glucose.
However, we do not see any evidence of further microbial activity
such as resuming CO2 production. The partial pressure of
CO2 was monitored for up to 3 days (not shown in Figure 3), during which time
CO2 did not increase but rather gradually decreased to
a constant value of around 145 mbar. This decrease was not due to
a leak because no increase in O2 was observed. One possible
explanation might be provided by the slow conversion of dissolved
CO2 to carbonic acid. Although OD measurements are convenient
for indicating the stage of bacterial growth (i.e., lag, exponential,
and stationary phases), the OD cannot determine the point of oxygen
depletion because there is no change in OD between phases C and D.
The OD measurements also do not indicate that CO2 production,
and thus the overall metabolic activity of E. coli, halts under the anaerobic conditions of phase D. For a full characterization
of bacterial growth in changing environments, OD measurements require
a complementary method to provide information on changes such as the
shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions.

To make sure that
in the isotopically labeled mixed sugar metabolism
experiments all CO2 observed was coming from the sugars
and not from the medium, we also performed experiments in an M9 minimal
medium. Figure 4 shows
a typical time-dependent CERS measurement of oxygen and CO2 partial pressures with simultaneous OD measurements for the metabolism
of E. coli in M9 supplemented with 20 mM glucose.
As before, the four different phases A to D can be clearly distinguished
by the gas analysis while OD is unable to distinguish the stationary
phase C from the end of aerobic respiration D. With about 5 h, the
lag phase is much longer compared to that in the LB medium. The oxygen
uptake rate is constant, as indicated by the almost perfect exponential
decay fit of oxygen partial pressure in Figure 4. The decay extends from the exponential
phase to the stationary phase with a rate constant of k = 0.134 h–1 or a half-life of t1/2 = 5.18 h, which is much slower than in LB. The longer
lag phase and the slower oxygen uptake and growth reflect the limitations
of the minimal medium compared to the rich LB medium. Similar results
were found in three repeat experiments which show a lag phase of between
4 and 7 h, the onset of stationary phase between 10 and 13 h, and
oxygen uptake rates of between 0.13 and 0.15 h–1.

Figure 4 As in Figure 3 but
now monitoring the aerobic E. coli metabolism of
unlabeled glucose (20 mM) in M9 minimal medium instead of LB medium.

A very distinct different behavior is exhibited
in terms of the
total yield of CO2. There is no 1:1 relationship between
oxygen consumed and CO2 being formed, but rather a considerable
amount of CO2 is missing. The RQ during stationary phase
growth of about 0.6 (within 2% in the three repeat experiments) indicates
that around 40% of CO2 is missing. This is even clearer
in the plot of the total pressure pO2 + pCO2 + pN2 (with a correction for dissolved CO2), also in the middle panel of Figure 4. The “missing” CO2 is not due to leaching some dissolved CO2 via carbonic
acid into bicarbonate and carbonate ions as determined in a test experiment,
in which acidifying by injecting HCl into the suspension at the end
of growth did not release any noticeable CO2 over an extended
period of time. The imbalance between O2 consumption and
CO2 production in the M9 medium is due to some glucose
not being fully oxidized to CO2 because it is the only
available carbon source for biomass synthesis, while O2 is still consumed. Tryptone and yeast extract provide amino acids
for growth in LB medium, but in minimal medium, E. coli must synthesize amino acids, nucleobases, and other biomolecules
from glucose. In minimal media, E. coli has been
found to accumulate a large amount of enzymes, which are virtually
absent when grown in LB medium and catalyze the formation of amino
acids from glucose, ammonia, and sulfate.34 Some formulations of minimal media incorporate casamino acids for
biomass synthesis so that sugars are not utilized as building blocks.
We did not incorporate casamino acids into the M9 medium to be certain
that the only available carbon sources for CO2 production
were the supplemented sugars. The need to synthesize essential precursor
molecules in M9 medium also contributes to the longer lag phase and
slower growth rate. It can be seen from the plot of the total pressure
that the rate of decrease is much higher during exponential growth
phase B than during stationary phase C. This is consistent with a
more significant imbalance between CO2 and O2 and a higher requirement for carbon for growth during the exponential
phase. About 80 mbar of CO2 is missing at the end of the
experiment, which corresponds to approximately 2.5 mmol of carbon
atoms. The dry weight of bacteria at the end is about 60 mg. Assuming
that about 50% of this is carbon, the bacteria contain about 2.5 mmol
of carbon atoms in total, in agreement with the missing CO2.

Experiments were repeated in M9 supplemented with lactose. Figure 5 shows typical time-dependent
traces for the aerobic metabolism of E. coli in M9
supplemented with 20 mM lactose, as measured by CERS with simultaneous
OD measurements. The results are very similar to M9 supplemented with
glucose with a similar lag phase. The exponential decay of oxygen
is characterized by an uptake rate of k = 0.155 h–1 (half-life t1/2 = 4.47
h) with a range of 0.15–0.17 h–1 in the three
repeats. This is somewhat faster compared to glucose but probably
not different enough to allow the distinction between lactose and
glucose metabolism just from a measurement of the uptake rate. Lactose
(C12H22O11) is a disaccharide derived
from the condensation of glucose and galactose. At complete conversion
to CO2 and H2O, there is again a 1:1 relationship
between oxygen consumed and CO2 being formed. In M9, however,
a considerable amount of CO2 is missing as in the previous
example of glucose in M9. As before, CO2 is missing because
the bacteria need a carbon source for their growth. Because the minimal
medium contains no other source of organic carbon, the bacteria must
utilize lactose. A noticeable difference concerns the behavior of
the OD curve. As before, the lag phase and exponential growth can
be easily seen in the OD curve. In the stationary phase, however,
the OD does not remain constant but first declines a little before
increasing again around the point where aerobic respiration terminates,
continuing to rise outside the range displayed in Figure 5. The reason for this behavior
is unclear at present; it might be related to dead cells breaking
up, possibly releasing slightly colored compounds which absorb red
light, in addition to scattering losses. In any case, it shows that
an OD measurement is a rather indirect determination of cell density
and therefore can suffer from interferences not directly related to
the density of living cells.

Figure 5 As in Figures 3 and 4, but now monitoring the
aerobic E. coli metabolism of unlabeled lactose (20
mM) in a minimal M9 medium.

Aerobic Mixed Sugar Metabolism of E. coli
Experiments were also done using DHR to characterize the metabolism.
In the DHR experiments, we used a lower sugar concentration (10 mM),
and because of the lower headspace volume, there is also less oxygen
available in the closed system. Typical examples of DHR measurements
with unlabeled sugars are shown in Figure 6. The same qualitative behavior as in the
CERS measurement was found, with the exception of the oxygen uptake
rate being faster with typically k = 0.20–0.25
h–1 within our repeats. The faster kinetics must
be related to the difference in the experimental conditions such as
more efficient O2 mass transfer to the solution or differences
in the sugar concentrations. Figure 6 shows that without isotope labeling it is not really
possible to distinguish the metabolism of different sugars from the
measurements of O2 and CO2 partial pressures.
In Figure 6a, M9 was
supplemented with 2.5 mM glucose; in this experiment, the glucose
is limiting, not the oxygen. Figure 6b shows the metabolism of 10 mM lactose, and Figure 6c shows the mixed
sugar metabolism of 2.5 mM glucose and 10 mM lactose
in M9. Even on close inspection of Figure 6c, no classic diauxic shift lag phase is
apparent, which would indicate the shift from one sugar to the other;
in fact, it would be even unclear whether glucose or lactose is first
metabolized or both are metabolized simultaneously.

Figure 6 DHR measurement of the
headspace in the aerobic E. coli metabolism of unlabeled
sugars in a minimal M9 medium (a) supplemented
with 2.5 mM glucose, (b) supplemented with 10 mM lactose, and (c)
supplemented with 2.5 mM glucose and 10 mM lactose.

The power of spectroscopic detection, however, is the possibility
to distinguish isotopes which allow the 13C labeling of
sugars and the detection of 13CO2 in the headspace.
Using spectroscopy, this can be easily quantified and distinguished
from 12CO2 derived from nonlabeled organic compounds.
This principle is demonstrated in Figure 7, showing an experiment with 2.5 mM 13C-glucose and 10 mM 12C-lactose in M9 as measured
by DHR, and in Figure 8, showing an experiment with 3 mM 13C-glucose and 20 mM 12C-lactose in M9 as measured by CERS. Both DHR and CERS are
capable of distinguishing 13CO2 arising first
from the 13C-labeled glucose and 12CO2 arising from the unlabeled lactose. We discuss the mixed sugar metabolism
of E. coli using the CERS experiment in Figure 8 as an example; the
DHR results and all repeats (at least in triplicate) have essentially
the same qualitative and quantitative behavior. As before, there is
a lag phase of about 6 h (A in Figure 8) after which exponential growth sets in (B in Figure 8). Exponential growth
is characterized by an increase in the OD up to its peak value of
about 1.8. After ca. 11.5 h, the OD remains more or less stationary,
indicating the stationary phase (C in Figure 8). During the exponential growth and stationary
phase, oxygen is continuously consumed and CO2 formed until
after about 30 h all oxygen is consumed, indicating the end of aerobic
respiration (D in Figure 8). The OD during phases C and D does not remain constant but
declines first and then rises again; this behavior seems to be typical
for lactose metabolism and was discussed before. As before, there
is some CO2 missing in the total balance, which is attributed
to incomplete conversion of the sugars to CO2 because M9
does not contain an alternative carbon source for bacterial growth.

glucose metabolism (B1 in Figure 8) to lactose metabolism (B2). As expected, glucose
is metabolized first. When glucose is nearly exhausted, lactose metabolism
takes over, without any apparent diauxic lag phase. In addition, there
is possibly some overlap between glucose and lactose metabolism. Similar
observations were made by Wang et al. in which Saccharomyces
cerevisiae natural isolates growing in mixtures of glucose
and galactose would switch to metabolizing both sugars before all
glucose was exhausted.35 They state that
classic diauxic growth with a distinct lag phase is one extreme on
a continuum of growth strategies determined by a cost–benefit
trade-off. In the literature, under conditions similar to those in
our experiment, diauxic lag phases typically of up to 1 h have been
reported for the diauxic shift from glucose to lactose in E. coli, often including OD measurements which showed an
increase during glucose metabolism and then a lag phase (stationary
OD), followed by a further increase attributed to lactose metabolism.1,2,36 In our experiments, no prolonged
diauxic lag is apparent in the oxygen consumption/CO2 production
or in the OD measurements (Figure 8b). All of our measurements have a smooth transition
from B1 (glucose metabolism) to B2 (lactose metabolism). Only the pO2 shows perhaps a slightly different
decay slope in B1 compared to that in B2 (Figure 8a, solid blue line). Diauxic growth is not
always made clear by a prolonged lag phase. Chu and Barnes proposed
a hypothesis that the length of the diauxic lag phase depends on the
characteristics of the environment.37 Bacteria
growing in rapidly changing environments need to be able to rapidly
adapt between two sugars. Our environment is distinct from the majority
of previous work studying diauxic shifts because it is oxygen-limited,
and the effects of rapidly depleted oxygen levels on the glucose–lactose
diauxic growth of E. coli are as of yet unknown.

In conclusion, without the spectroscopic distinction of the 13C-labeled and unlabeled sugars, no preference or diauxic
shifts of metabolism would be apparent in our CO2/O2 or OD measurements. Despite their widespread use, OD measurements
are a very indirect method of characterizing bacterial growth and
phases. However, they are prone to interference and should be used
only in combination with more advanced techniques to supplement more
specific measurements such as the spectroscopic measurements in the
present study.

Conclusions
Measuring the headspace
above bacterial suspensions by spectroscopy
to characterize bacterial growth and metabolism has many advantages
compared to more conventional techniques. It is nonintrusive, it does
not require sampling and thus can be applied to closed systems easily,
and it is very sensitive and highly selective because of the spectroscopic
fingerprint of headspace gases. The high selectivity allows isotopic
distinction, which enables isotopic labeling studies. In this article,
we have introduced two powerful new techniques for headspace monitoring:
photoacoustic detection in a differential Helmholtz resonator (DHR)
and Raman spectroscopy enhanced in an optical cavity (CERS). Both
techniques have been shown to be able to monitor O2 and
CO2 and its isotopomers with excellent sensitivity and
time resolution. Compared to DHR, CERS has the advantage of easier
calibration due to the availability of internal standards (N2 or Si peaks). Without further modifications, the CERS method can
also detect other important gases in the metabolism of bacteria, such
as H2, H2S, or N2. DHR has the advantage
of a much simpler setup and being even more cost-effective. The technique
can measure O2, CO2, and H2S with
high sensitivity and selectivity; extension to the detection of other
molecules would require different diode laser sources, however.

OD measurements are a standard, widely used technique to characterize
bacterial growth. We have discussed and shown some of its shortcomings
if used on its own without supporting complementary measurements.
OD measurements are an indirect indicator of bacterial growth. They
suffer from interference, and they cannot distinguish living cells
from dead cells and debris. OD measurements can therefore not provide
sufficient information once the OD becomes constant during the stationary
phase of bacterial growth. They also cannot distinguish diauxic growth
without a diauxic lag phase present. The spectroscopic measurements,
however, can clearly and unambiguously distinguish the different stages
of bacterial growth characterizing the growth phases in the different
media studied, LB and M9. OD measurements can supplement these measurements,
but they are not necessary. We have demonstrated how 13C isotopic labeling of sugars in the spectroscopic detection allows
the study of bacterial mixed sugar metabolism to establish whether
sugars are sequentially or simultaneously metabolized. For E. coli, we have characterized the shift from glucose to
lactose metabolism without a classic diauxic lag phase in-between,
under oxygen-limited conditions.

DHR and CERS have been proven
to be cost-effective, highly specific
analytical tools in the biosciences and in biotechnology, complementing
and superseding existing conventional techniques. They also provide
new capabilities for mechanistic investigations, in particular due
to the possibility to use isotopic labeling easily. In the future,
we plan to apply these techniques to further mechanistic studies of
bacterial metabolism, monitoring of continuously operating systems,
and anaerobic bioprocesses.
