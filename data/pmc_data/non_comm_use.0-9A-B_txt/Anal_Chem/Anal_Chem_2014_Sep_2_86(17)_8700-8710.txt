The
N-glycan diversity of human serum glycoproteins, i.e., the
human blood serum N-glycome, is both complex and constrained by the
range of glycan structures potentially synthesizable by human glycosylation
enzymes. The known glycome, however, has been further limited by methods
of sample preparation, available analytical platforms, e.g., based
upon electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and software
tools for data analysis. In this report several improvements have
been implemented in sample preparation and analysis to extend ESI-MS
glycan characterization and to include polysialylated N-glycans. Sample
preparation improvements included acidified, microwave-accelerated,
PNGase F N-glycan release to promote lactonization, and sodium borohydride
reduction, that were both optimized to improve quantitative yields
and conserve the number of glycoforms detected. Two-stage desalting
(during solid phase extraction and on the analytical column) increased
sensitivity by reducing analyte signal division between multiple reducing-end-forms
or cation adducts. Online separations were improved by using extended
length graphitized carbon columns and adding TFA as an acid modifier
to a formic acid/reversed phase gradient, providing additional resolving
power and significantly improved desorption of both large and heavily
sialylated glycans. To improve MS sensitivity and provide gentler
ionization conditions at the source-MS interface, subambient pressure
ionization with nanoelectrospray (SPIN) was utilized. When these improved
methods are combined together with the Glycomics Quintavariate Informed
Quantification (GlyQ-IQ) recently described (Kronewitter et al. Anal. Chem. 2014 , 86 , 6268 −6276 24881670 ), we are able to significantly extend glycan
detection sensitivity and provide expanded glycan coverage. We demonstrated
the application of these advances in the context of the human serum
glycome, and for which our initial observations included the detection
of a new class of heavily sialylated N-glycans, including polysialylated
N-glycans.

==== Body
Glycosylation
is an important,
widespread protein modification in human biology and broadly present
in most domains of life. In humans it is estimated that greater than
50% of proteins can be glycosylated,2 and
if O-glycosylation (e.g., O-GlcNAc and O-fucose) modifications were
also considered, the number is indeed much higher. Glycans play highly
specific, specialized roles at the molecular level, including cell-cell
signaling, virus-receptor binding, immune responses, and protein folding
and solubility. The glycome of human blood serum has been increasingly
of interest for disease biomarker discovery because serum contains
the host’s response to systemic disease (e.g., immunoglobulin
glycoproteins) and can be collected in a minimally invasive manner
at relatively low cost. Indeed, the composition and structures of
glycans released from human serum/plasma have provided candidate biomarkers
for a wide range of cancer types.3−14 Novel glycoforms have also been observed by profiling glycoproteins
(e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor) excreted from cancer cell
lines.15

Polysialic acid, a unique
residue found on the antennae of glycans,
is characterized by polymeric chains of sialic acid consisting of
α2,8-linked or α2,9-linked (or alternating linkages16) sialic acid monomers with a degree of polymerization
(DP) of 2 or more. Extended long chains of negatively charged glycopolymers
exhibit unusual biological properties and have been shown to affect
many biological systems,17 including cell-cell
adhesion,18,19 multipotent stem cells,20,21 brain plasticity,22−24 voltage sensitive sodium channels,25 cell-T lymphocyte interactions,26 dendritic cell migration,27 natural killer
(NK) cell cytotoxicity,28 circadian rhythm
regulation,29−31 and cancer tumor cells.32,33

The reported size of serum glycan profiles varies greatly
(18-113
glycan compositions) as reviewed previously.34 Recent papers utilizing liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) have reported up to 73 glycan compositions for permethylated
glycans35 and up to 66 compositions4 (300 isomers) for native, reduced glycans.36,37 Earlier studies from our laboratory reported 126 compositions for
native, reduced glycans based upon analyses using a subambient pressure
nanoESI (SPIN) source34 and we recently
reported extension to 142 glycans and 645 isomer peaks.1 Although polysialylated N-glycans have been reported
on the human neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), to our knowledge,
there have been to date no reports describing polysialylated N-glycans
in human serum or their direct detection using mass spectrometry (MS).

In this study improvements in sample preparation and informatics
were shown to enable the observation of a subclass of “heavily”
sialylated complex type glycans defined here as glycan compositions
containing more sialic acids than expected antennae. N-glycan antennae
are the branches of monosaccharides attached to the trimannose-chitobiose
N-glycan core. In the case of complex type glycans, each antenna consists
of a minimum of one N-acetylhexosamine and one hexose (typically a
galactose). This criterion has previously been used to support the
discrimination of polysialic acid because more sialic acids residues
than antennae results in at least one antennae with more than one
sialic acid attached.38 Several of the
polysialylated glycans were identified in their lactone form, including
the formation of a lactone alongside the glycosidic bond connecting
two polymerized sialic acid residues.16 The additional lactone bond stabilizes the polysialic acid chains,
increasing MS detectability. Use of the GlyQ-IQ software in combination
with high performance computation facilitated both sample processing
and instrumentation analysis for performing high-sensitivity MS glycan
measurements. N-glycans released from serum proteins by Peptide: N-Glycosidase
F (PNGase F) were profiled with graphitized carbon liquid chromatography
(LC) coupled to a high-resolution, high-mass accuracy mass spectrometer
retrofitted with a SPIN source.39 The SPIN
source increases both signal intensities and charge states and aids
in the detection of labile sialylated glycans by providing gentler
ionization conditions at the MS interface.34,40 In addition to detecting standard high mannose, complex, and hybrid
type glycans, families of glycans with polysialic acid extensions
were also detected leading to expanded glycan profiles and libraries.

Methods
Materials
A pooled reference human blood serum sample
(male, blood type AB, not heat inactivated) was used for all glycomics
analyses (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Serial extraction cartridges
were used for glycan purification: C8 (Discovery 500 mg, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and graphitized carbon cartridges (Carbograph 150 mg,
Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL). The Hypercarb porous graphitized
carbon (Hypercarb PGC) particles were used for the HPLC stationary
phase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

All other chemicals,
sample preparation, and analysis were consistent with that previously
reported.1,34,41 The following
reagents were used in sample preparation: PNGase F purified from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (New England BioLabs, Ipswich,
MA) Nanopure or Milli-Q quality water (18 MΩ cm or better),
sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), sodium borohydride
(NaBH4), dithiothreitol (DTT), ethanol (EtOH), trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA), acetonitrile (AcN), hydrochloric acid (HCl), formic acid.
All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless
otherwise specified.

Sample Preparation
The overall pipeline
for glycan
profiling shown in Figure 1 spans glycan sample
preparation through LC–MS data acquisition and subsequent data
informatics. Previous sample preparation methods were discussed in
detail and reported by Kronewitter et al.1,34,42 Key developments and features of this glycan
release and purification protocol include an acidified (pH 5.5) PNGase
F glycan release using a microwave reactor (CEM Discover, Matthews,
NC), automated serial dual cartridge (C8 and graphitized carbon),
glycan enrichment, and purification on a Gilson GX-274 ASPEC liquid
handler (Gilson, Middleton, WI), and long gradient graphite HPLC (60
cm long, 75 μm i.d.).

Figure 1 Experimental sample preparation and data analysis
pipeline.

Aliquots of serum (100 μL)
were mixed with 50 μL of
buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate with 20 mM DTT) and acidified to pH
5.5 using 1 M HCl. The samples were denatured by heating them in an
Eppendorf 1.5 μL Thermomixer set at 95 °C for 2 min and
let to cool before PNGase F was added. The samples were deglycosylated
with 2 μL of PNGase F in a microwave reactor set to solid-phase
synthesis (SPS) mode to allow for constant power experiments.42 The catalyzed microwave reactor digestion and
lactonization took place at constant power (20 W) for 40 min (4 ×
10 min intervals), and the 50 mL cooling water in the reactor was
exchanged with chilled water (4 °C) after each interval to keep
the maximum temperature observed during the reaction less than 50
°C. EtOH (80% v/v) was used to precipitate deglycosylated proteins
via a 60 min exposure in a −80 °C freezer followed by
a 30 min centrifugation. The supernatant containing the glycans was
isolated and dried before reduction. The samples were reduced with
1 M NaBH4 at 60 °C for 60 min. The dual cartridge
(C8, Graphite) solid phase extraction (SPE) and desalting were performed
with customized algorithms optimized for decreased sample carryover
and precise liquid transfer across SPE cartridges. The samples were
first passed through the C8, and the flow-through was trapped on the
graphite for glycan enrichment and desalting. Glycans were eluted
from the graphite stationary phase with three aqueous solutions comprised
of different AcN and TFA concentrations. The fractionation included
the following additions: 2 mL of 10% AcN, 2.25 mL of 20% AcN, and
1.75 mL of 40% AcN with 0.1% TFA, 0.5 mL of nanopure H2O, and 2 mL of 40% AcN with 0.1% TFA. The eluted fractions were combined
and dried.

HPLC and Mass Spectrometry
The in-house
built LC system
used two Agilent 1200 nanoflow pumps (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA), Valco valves (Valco Instruments Co., Houston, TX), and
a PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC) and was automated
using custom software (LCMSNet) that allowed for parallel event coordination
and therefore, approximately, 100% MS duty cycle was achieved through
the use of two analytical columns. Two-column operation permitted
columns to be “washed” and reconditioned off-line without
any loss of duty cycle. Graphite capillary columns were used with
the following specifications: 60 cm long × 360 μm o.d.
× 75 μm i.d. (Polymicro Technologies Inc., Phoenix, AZ)
with a 1 cm sol–gel frit for media retention.43 The fused silica columns were slurry packed in-house with
3 μm diameter Hypercarb PGC particles. Each column was electrically
isolated from the switching valves with a 15 cm, 30 μm i.d.
empty fused silica capillary tube.44 Adding
empty isolator columns did not adversely affect the chromatography
or result in significant peak broadening.

A dual acid modifier
reversed phase gradient was used for liquid chromatographic separation.
The mobile phase consisted of mobile phase A, 0.1% formic acid in
H2O, and mobile phase B, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in AcN.
The samples were loaded at 1% B and the 90 min analytical gradient
used was (time in minutes:% mobile phase B): 0:1%, 1:4%, 2:6%, 91:30%,
95:95%, 96:95%, 100:1.%. In between each run a wash and condition
gradient was applied: 0:1%, 1:5%, 6:40%, 10:80%, 12:90%, 32:100%,
41:100%, 45:1%, 69:1%.

An Exactive Orbitrap MS (Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, CA) was used
for glycan profiling and a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro MS (Thermo Scientific)
was used for tandem MS measurements. Both instruments were operated
in ultrahigh resolution mode (100 K resolution at m/z 400) with an m/z range of 200–3000 and three microscans were averaged per
spectrum. The AGC was set for high dynamic range (3× 106) with a maximum ion injection time of 100 ms. The front end ion
optics on both instruments were modified to include a SPIN-MS interface.39 In the SPIN-MS interface the ESI emitter is
brought into the first vacuum region of the MS directly adjacent to
an electrodynamic ion funnel that has been described in detail previously.39,45 For clarity, the systems will be referred to as the SPIN Exactive
and SPIN Velos systems and the data used to complement each other
rather than for juxtaposition.

Lactonized Polysialic Acid
Chains
Evidence of lactone
bond formation during the acidified glycan release helped detect polysialylation
by stabilizing some or all of the sialic acid glycosidic bonds so
the initial glycan remain intact throughout the experiment. Lactonization
occurs through a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group
and hydroxyl group on adjacent sialic acid monomers yielding the loss
of water (−18.010 Da) per lactone bond formed and decreased
monoisotopic mass observed in the mass spectra.16 The combination of the lactone bond stabilization and gentler
ionization conditions present in the SPIN source40 aided the MS analysis. The lactone group can also be used
to differentiate polysialylation from monosialylated antennae because
the presence of lactones indicated a chain length of at least two.

Data Analysis
High-resolution LC–MS data sets
were analyzed with the GlyQ-IQ annotation software with high performance
computing as described elsewhere.1 Briefly,
the GlyQ-IQ software uses five measurement metrics (exact mass, isotope
fit scoring, LC peak modeling and fitting, glycan family relationships,
and in-source fragmentation) to identify and annotate glycans in LC–MS
data sets. The GlyQ-IQ Viewer and GlycoGrid 4D visualization were
used for manual annotation and glycan profile visualization.1,34 Manual inspection of the isotopic envelopes was used to ensure that
each feature reported was also supported by high-resolution spectral
evidence (i.e., a confident and accurate MS molecular weight assignments
and isotopic envelope profiles). High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) data collected on the SPIN Velos system were manually annotated.

Results and Discussion
Results
Applying the Suite of Refined
Methods
We were able
to evaluate and improve the experimental coverage of the serum glycome
by a combination of (1) acidified PNGase F digestion, (2) increasing
sample signal by sample processing improvements and gentle ionization
conditions provided by a SPIN ionization source, and (3) using high-sensitivity,
high-specificity software.1 The present
results support the observations of polysialylated N-glycans from
serum glycoproteins with strong corroboration between the detection
of several glycan families grouped together by differing amounts of
sialic acid, MS/MS fragmentation, and in-source fragmentation.

Polysialylated
Glycan Families
Interglycan evidence
of polysialylated N-glycans included the high-resolution, high-mass
accuracy spectra and clusters of glycans with large degrees of sialic
acid (more sialic acid than branches) that differed in mass by one
sialic acid monomer. An exemplary glycan family supporting polysialic
acid identification contained 7–11 sialic acids, 1–2
fucose monosaccharides, and no lactonization. Respective mass spectra
for the sialylated glycan family are presented in Figure 2 along with putative structures using the CFG nomenclature.46 In addition to the sialic acid and fucose differences
presented in Figure 2, there are also related
comparable clusters found with one more hexose or N-acetylhexosamine
as shown circled in Figure 3. Almost all of
the polysialylated glycans detected here contained at least one fucose
and were consistent with the well-studied N-glycans detected on the
neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) in the brain suggesting similar
glycosyltransferase and glycosidase machinery was used.17,38,47−49 Several more
hybrid and bisecting HexNAc structures were observed that were also
supported by prior reported structural analysis.38

Figure 2 Example mass spectra of polysialylated glycans containing 7–11
sialic acids and 1–2 fucose residues. Putative glycan structures
are shown and the compositions are consistent with number of sialic
acid groups exceeding the possible number of N-glycan antennae. The
glycan structure depictions are constant with the CFG nomenclature
where the squares = N-acetylhexosamine, circles = hexose, triangles
= fucose, and diamonds = sialic acid.

for polysialic acid and lactonization (orange) and the former library

glycans that differed by either a sialic acid or a fucose residue.
Blue horizontal lines indicate regions where polysialylated glycans
were plotted.

High-Resolution, Higher-Energy
Collisional Dissociation (HCD)
Glycan Fragmentation
To explore the use of HCD spectra for
improved characterization of glycan fragmentation patterns and elucidate
structural information, Figure 4 displays the
spectrum acquired for a polysialylated glycan with composition Hex4HexNAc7Fuc1Neu5Ac4 (Lacone2). This structure was chosen as an example because of the
limited number of hexose monosaccharides present, the large number
of sialic acid residues, the multiple lactone groups, and its HCD
fragmentation pattern. Figure 4 shows an inlayed
“zoomed-in” mass spectrum and a putative glycan structure.

Figure 4 High-resolution
HCD spectrum of fragments from N-glycan containing
polysialic acid. Inset: high-resolution MS1 spectrum indicating monoisotopic
mass and a putative cartoon of the glycan structure. CFG nomenclature
was used to denote mass differences with the following modification:
Open circle symbols represent generic hexose mass differences.

When subtracting out the N-glycan
pentasaccharide core, only one
hexose (presumably galactose) remains and restricts the antennae extension
count to one. Glycans with only one antenna extended beyond the N-acetylhexosamine
residues yielded one attachment site for enzymatic addition of sialic
acid and subsequently, a single, polysialylated chain. Thus, a chain
of 4 sialic acids (with 2 lactone bonds) is favored over several individual
sialic acid monosaccharides. Although single antennae can be predicted,
additional information is needed to determine to which branch of the
core the antenna is attached.

Diagnostic ions at m/z 292.103
and 274.092 (water loss) indicated sialic acid was present in the
compound, but alone was not diagnostic for polysialic acid, since
both ions were also observed in nonpolysialylated glycan fragmentation
spectra. In addition the presence of sialic acid as part of ions at m/z 657.235, 819.289, and 1362.465 indicated
that a sialic acid monosaccharide was attached to the terminal hexose,
and it was postulated that it does not directly contain one of the
two stabilizing lactone bonds which could be present between the terminal
three sialic acids.

The reduced alditol terminus of the core
N-acetylhexosamine (+2
hydrogen atoms) was not detected nor was any fucose differences detected
on the antennae fragments. This combined absence suggested the fucose
was bonded to the core and this group was lost in the isolation and
fragmentation process.

In-Source Fragmentation Sialic Acid Verification
The
nonfucosylated form of the glycan in Figure 5, Hex4HexNAc7Neu5Ac4 (Lactone2), shows an example of in-source fragmentation detection indicating
the presence of Neu5Ac in the composition. The GlyQ-IQ software identified
the matched pair by searching for features one sialic acid greater
than or less than the target mass (±291.095 Da, adjusted for
charge states).

Figure 5 In-source fragmentation detected linking Hex4HexNAc7Neu5Ac3 (Lactone2) and Hex4HexNAc7Neu5Ac4 (Lactone2)
by one
Neu5Ac residue. The first chromatographic peak shown on the left between
the vertical lines had a correlation coefficient of 0.999 after the
peaks were modeled and correlated. The inlayed mass spectrum corresponded
to the high-resolution isotope profiles of the parent (orange) and
fragment (gray) glycans. Cartoon structures (CFG nomenclature) of
the parent and fragment illustrate the in-source fragmentation loss
of a sialic acid.

The extracted ion chromatograms
were extracted, bounded by the
overlapping region, each peak was modeled, and the model peaks were
correlated together.1 The correlation information
not only confirmed that the mass was glycan related, but it also confirmed
one of the four common monosaccharides searched was present in the
compound without using MS/MS. In addition to the main peak correlation
at 81.3 min, other isomeric structures were also conceivable at elution
times 81.65, 82.1, and 82.2 min.

Human Serum Glycan Profile
Overall, 290 glycan compositions
were experimentally annotated and of those, 68 confirmed by all 5
variables of the GlyQ-IQ paradigm.1 Each
reported composition has been manually verified using the GlyQ-IQ
Viewer1 by reviewing the glycan isotopic
profile to ensure the correct monoisotopic mass was chosen. GlyQ-IQ
was able to identify and remove 81 detected species (8% of the total)
that corresponded to in-source fragmentation products. The 290 experientially
detected glycan compositions and 994 chromatography separated isomers
are presented in Supplementary Table 2 in the Supporting Information. The applied data processing methods
resulted in the detection of an additional 134 identifications and
22 in-source fragmentation confirmations beyond the former retrosynthetic
glycan library results where polysialic acid was not included.1

Figure 3 includes
glycan profiles resulting from applying the latest polysialylated
glycan library developed in this work (orange) and our previous results
(black) with no polysialic acid considerations. The number of hexose
residues in a composition can be used to determine the maximum possible
number of antennae that can be sialylated because the terminal galactose
is a required substrate for sialic acid glycosyltransferase activity.
When the number of sialic acid residues is greater than the number
of antennae in complex glycans (total hexose – (3) core hexose),
polysialylation is likely to occur on one more antennae and the display
regions are indicated with a blue horizontal bar. While 99% of nonheavily
sialylated annotated features passed the GlyQ-IQ feature validation
process, only 93% of the heavily sialylated glycans passed due to
the 17-fold larger library size and larger monoisotopic masses.

Observed Lactonization
The percent lactonization can
be calculated by dividing the number of lactone groups by the total
number of sialic acids residues in the composition. Interestingly,
we observed significant “heavily” sialylated glycans
containing a low level of lactones (1–2 lactones), as indicated
in Figure 6 showing 20% lactonized at this
level. This was also consistent with polysialylated glycans that were
in the initial stage of lactonization.50 In contrast, the glycans with a large number of lactones (more than
2) had lactonization peaking at ∼80% (Figure 6). Despite our use of gentle ionization, in-source fragmentation
detection, lactonization, and sensitive software, it remains likely
that even longer chains of polysialic acid existed in the sample studied.

of sialic acid residues) distribution of all “heavily”
sialylated glycans. Orange denotes glycans with no lactonization detected.
Light gray indicates glycans with 1–2 lactones. Dark gray indicates
glycans with more than 2 lactones.

Combining the Evidence
Multiple pieces of evidence
were used to support the presence of polysialylated N-glycans in human
serum. Although only 46% of the mass was covered by MS/MS analysis,
it greatly reduced the number of combinatorial possibilities that
can explain the remainder of the parent mass. The unknown mass difference
between the intact parent molecule and the minimum N-glycan composition
stipulated by the fragmentation spectrum (N-glycan core + sialylated
lactosamine branch, Hex4HexNAc3NeuAc at mass
1568.571 Da) is 1795.641 Da.

The polysialylation hypothesis
used to explain the mass difference included hits from a combinatorial
expansion comprised of hexose (ranges 4–12), HexNAc (ranges
3–8), fucose (ranges 1–7), and Neu5Ac (ranges 1–15).
The allowable number of sialic acid lactonization ranged from 0 to
14 (N – 1, where N is the
number of sialic acid residues polymerized). The polysialylated glycan
Hex4HexNAc7FucNeuAc4 with 2 lactones
was the only glycan hit using an excessively large 30 ppm window.
The relaxed tolerance was used to indicate no other close hits were
possible using this parameter set.

Figure 7 includes a summary of information
used from the glycan family relationships, fragmentation ions, and
accurate mass to support the heavily sialylated glycan compositions
assignment and how the limited number of hexose residues and lactonization
were used to predict the polysialylated sialic acid extension on the
antennae. The polysialylated glycan Hex4HexNAc7FucNeuAc4 (2 Lactones) was detected in a glycan family
with 7 primary family members with the same Hex4HexNAc7 base and differ by a single monosaccharide (and an additional
5 secondary members with disaccharide relationships) with the following
fucose and Neu5Ac combinations: Fuc0(Neu5Ac3, Neu5Ac4, Neu5Ac5), Fuc1(Neu5Ac3, Neu5Ac4, Neu5Ac5, and Fuc2(Neu5Ac4, Neu5Ac5). Diagnostic ions detected
in the fragmentation data and monosaccharide differences between fragment
ions were used to confirm at least one sialylated LacNAc branch. Combining
this information with accurate match only allowed for one composition
to explain the parent mass. No other combinations of these monosaccharides
could explain the parent mass allowing for a generous 30 ppm mass
tolerance.

mass.

Discussion
Refined Sample
Preparation
In this work, we have refined
a reduced, nonderivatized N-glycan sample preparation pipeline to
improve MS detection by coalescing glycan peaks into one reduced,
desalinated glycoform with intrinsic signal intensity since the glycan
signal was not divided between reducing-end-forms or cation adducts.
The high performance cation removal is further explained in the section
S1 in the Supporting Information and a
desalinated spectrum is presented in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. Multiple charge states
were detected per glycan as a product of the electrospray ionization,
and the feature abundances were added together via the GlyQ-IQ software.1 The nonderivatized glycomics approach implemented
here can be performed in relatively mild conditions, with reduced
sample handling, and subsequently will produce glycan profiles with
minimal perturbations. Positive mode, proton adducted N-glycans analyzed
by LC–ESI-MS has been shown to be a desirable form for quantification
since the ion abundances correlate well with fluorescently labeled
HPLC results.51 The high sensitivity of
this current method is achieved by combining quantitative chemical
reactions, searching for lactone stabilized polysialic acid chains,
improved chromatographic stationary phase desorption, chromatographic
isomer peak separation, and gentle electrospray ionization conditions.
The details involved in refining several aspects of the workflow are
discussed below.

One Step, Multiple Effects
Lowering
the pH of the PNGase
F digestion to 5.5 from the optimal (pH 7.5–8.0)52 had two beneficial effects, while maintaining
the fast, efficient release with the microwave reactor. First, reduced
glycans were obtained by first quantitatively converting the reducing
end of the glycans to the water-stable aldehyde form during the acidified
PNGase F glycan release step. The homogeneous form allows for following
a then predictable conversion to desired reduced alditol product during
the reducing-end aldehyde reduction step. Second, the lower pH in
conjunction with the microwave-assisted reactions53 (at relatively elevated temperatures ∼50 °C)54 favors lactone formation and leads to sialic
acid stabilization. Although it is hard to distinguish native lactone
formation from sample handling induced lactonization, the acidified
release conditions may have helped stabilize the polysialylated glycan
modifications by forming lactone bonds between sialic acid residues
through acid catalyzed condensation reactions.

Effect 1:
Acid Catalyzed Glycan Deamination Mechanism
The acidified
digestion conditions developed for this research simplified
the reducing-end mixture so glycans were in a single form prior to
reduction. This approach overcame any reducing-end heterogeneity that
divides the glycan signals and complicates the data analysis. As the
glycans were initially released, their N-glycan core was terminated
with a β-glycosylamine conjugated with ammonia.55 Particular attention was spent on the accelerated PNGase
F release56 and the respective mixture
of reducing-end glycoforms produced when the glycan-asparagine bond
was cleaved. The amine readily hydrolyzed in aqueous conditions over
the course of minutes to hours57 to form
an aldehyde. This resulted in producing a mixture of the amine and
aldehyde forms in solution when accelerated reactions were used, such
as using immobilized enzyme57 or microwave
reactors.41,56

Multiple glycoforms behaved differently
in subsequent reaction and purification steps, and such mixtures should
be avoided57 to ensure the glycans are
fully in the alditol form and display good chromatographic separations.
The acidic conditions were sufficient to convert all released glycans
to their aldehyde form prior to reduction, as determined indirectly
by monitoring the completeness of the reducing-end reduction reaction
as the aldehyde form needs to be present for conversion to the alditol
form in a reducing environment. Any residual amino forms present contributed
to the unconverted aldehyde quantity, since they will be gradually
hydrolyzed into the aldehyde form via water hydrolysis during the
subsequent sample preparation. The quantitative conversion is depicted
in Figure 8, which shows the alditol (A) and
trace aldehyde (B) forms detected.

Figure 8 Extracted ion chromatograms (m/z 1040.89) showed the quantitative reduction to
alditol form achieved
by quantitative hydrolysis of β-glycosylamine groups first.
99.7% conversion to the alditol form was achieved.

Once all of the glycans were in one reducing end
form prior to
downstream reduction, the reduction was performed quantitatively.
This provided an optimized signal since there was no glycoform partitioning.
In addition reducing the pH of the reaction buffer prior to digestion
decreased the overall processing time by eliminating the need for
sequential acid treatments.

Effect 2: Microwave-Assisted
Sialic Acid Lactonization
The acidic digestion served a secondary
purpose of starting the acid
lactonization stabilization of polysialic acid residues. The presence
of a lactone was detected by the mass loss corresponding to one water
molecule from the intact mass of a parent glycan containing two or
more sialic acid residues. There are three stages of lactonization
for polysialylated glycans which include initialization or precursory
(1–2 lactone modifications), middle stage (multiple lactone
species up to DP-2), and final stage (complete lactonization).50

Surprisingly, lactonized sialic acid has
previously been reported to be stable at 4 °C in 1.0 M HCl solutions
overnight, which is helpful in preserving the sialylation structure
through sample preparation.50 Several heavily
sialylated N-glycans were detected with 1–2 lactone modifications
that are consistent with the lactonization initiation process. Figure 9 depicts a distribution of detected lactone modifications
in the heavily sialylated glycans that indicated a large percentage
of polysialylated species present in the precursory lactonization
stage (1–2 lactones detected).

Figure 9 Number of lactones detected per “heavily”
sialylated
glycan.

However, lactonization is susceptible
to environmental conditions
(pH changes), and it is difficult to differentiate lactonization artifacts
introduced during sample preparation from physiological lactonization
in the serum.

Long Column Chromatography
HPLC
performance on slurry
packed, graphitized carbon nanoLC columns was improved by increasing
the column length to improve chromatographic peak resolution and by
adding TFA to the mobile phase gradient. Adding the TFA to the mobile
phase during LC–MS data acquisition was not only more consistent
with the elution of fractions used in the sample preparation solid
phase extraction step but also produced narrower, taller peaks58 and was amenable to desorbing acidic sialylated
glycans from the graphite stationary phase.59 Additional enhanced performance observed from the chromatography
setup is expanded in section S2 in the Supporting
Information.

Gentle Ionization Conditions and Polysialylated
Glycans
The SPIN source facilitated sialic acid detection
by providing enhanced
signal intensities, higher charge states, and apparently, gentler
ionization and ion transfer.34 The gentle
electrospray conditions provided by the SPIN ionization source helped
to reduce the internal energy of the molecules and minimize in-source
fragmentation. The additional glycan coverage of labile heavily sialylated
glycan species provided by this method have been presented in Figure 10 where the nonsialylated (column 0) and common
sialylated glycans detected were colored in gray and the heavily sialylated
glycans with more sialic acids than predicted branches were in orange.
The gentle ionization conditions were particularly important for polysialylated
glycans because they were low in abundance, relatively high mass,
and fragment in-source under energetic ionization conditions.

Figure 10 Number of
sialic acid residues per glycan. Orange denotes “heavily”
sialylated glycans. Gray includes typical monosialylation on the terminus
of the galactose residue. Nonsialylated glycans, such as high mannose
glycans, are included in the 0 column.

One possible explanation for the augmented polysialic acid
detection
was that the SPIN source has a different (and faster/shorter) desolvation
profile than, e.g., a conventional heated capillary ESI interface
where charged droplets are desolvated more rapidly in a lower pressure
region rather than, e.g., a heated capillary at near atmospheric pressure.
Shortening the capillary has previously been shown to enhance detection
of higher mobility ions (e.g., highly charged glycans).60 This effect is further enhanced in the SPIN
interface because the sample solution is electrosprayed directly into
an electrodynamic ion funnel in a region at ∼20 Torr, negating
both the conventional period at atmospheric pressure as well as the
period in transit through a higher pressure heated region as desolvation
and ionization occur. The carboxylic acid groups present in sialic
acid monosaccharides have relatively high hydrogen bonding stabilization
energy with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, which can form hydrogen
bonding interactions with the H and O atoms of the water molecules.61 This stabilization effect causes the carboxylic
acid groups to desolvate a water molecule later than other sites under
desolvating conditions. Delaying this process was important for sialic
acid ion stability because if desolvated too early, where the desolvation
environments are often harshest, the fully desolvated molecule is
prone to in-source fragmentation via proton transfer from the carboxylic
acid to the glycosidic bond. We postulated that by delaying the desolvation
to cooler regions of the source, such as inside the electrodynamic
ion funnel, and by reaching this stage more rapidly, the stability
of the sialic acid residues is increased as the final desolvation
occurs in a gentler environment.

Expanded Theoretical Retrosynthetic
Glycan Library
Utilizing the increased measurement sensitivity,
we expanded a former
retrosynthetic glycan library from its conception in 200962 and minor expansion in 2012,34 to improve the coverage of the human serum glycome. The
initial library was bounded in glycan size by tetra-antennary, penta-fucosylated,
tetra-sialylated glycans with a bisecting N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc).
These bounds were set because much larger glycans were rarely detected,
e.g., using label-free matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
(MALDI) conditions. However, applying gentle LC–ESI-MS platforms,
larger, multiply charged, and more labile glycans can be detected,
and we recently demonstrated that the SPIN source interface was able
to detect additional glycans generally not observed using conventional
ESI-MS platforms.1,34

The expanded retrosynthetic
glycan library now includes fucosylated high mannose structures (Man3-12)
and an overall degree of fucosylation up to 7 (increased from 5).34 N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) groups were expanded
to include branching up to penta-antennary and containing poly-N-acetyllactosamine
(polyLacNAc) groups, so that 7 LacNAc in total are considered (increased
from 4).34 This allowed the glycan sizes
extended to those with 10 hexose and 8 HexNAc monosaccharides (increased
from 7 hexose and 7 HexNAc).34 Although
glycans with 8 LacNAc groups (tetra antennary N-glycan with 4 polyLacNAc)
have been reported at low abundance on recombinant BRP 3 erythropoietin
applying a 2-D separation (anion exchange, HILIC),63 the largest number of LacNAc groups that we were able to
detect in this study in our serum sample was 5.

In the present
work the allowable amount of sialic acid residues
was expanded to include polysialylation and set to a limit of 20 degrees
of polymerization (increased from 5 nonpolymerized sialic acid monosaccharides).34 Although the actual maximum chain length is
currently unknown, previous HPLC-based studies reported degrees of
sialic acid polymerization of 15–35 for protein glycosylation
and up to 50 on N-CAM.35 However, the largest
sialylated species detected here with an acceptable GlyQ-IQ profile
contained 18 sialic acids while the majority of the heavily sialylated
group contained 4–9 sialic acid residues.

Lactonization
was addressed by including 0 to 100% lactonization
of sialylated glycans in the library. The latest theoretical retrosynthetic
glycan library has been included as Supplementary Table 1 in the Supporting Information and contains 3257 theoretical
glycan compositions and 19 383 glycan masses (with lactonization
modifications allowed). Formerly, only 436 glycans were considered
in the library.34 The scalability and high
specificity of the GlyQ-IQ software and HPC implementation was amenable
to the relatively large, sparse, theoretical retrosynthetic glycan
library presented here.

Conclusions
We
have developed an approach for improved glycoform characterization
based upon several developments that included increases in detectable
analyte (reduced signal division from quantitative reactions and methodical
desalting), more sensitive ionization (high ion transmission and softer
ionization using the SPIN source), enhanced liquid chromatography
(60 cm graphite fused silica columns with TFA modified formic acid
AcN/water gradient), and high sensitivity and specificity software
(GlyQ-IQ characterization leveraging theoretical retrosynthetic glycan
libraries and high performance computing).1 Using this composite method for human serum glycan profiling, 290
glycan compositions were elucidated and 68 were confirmed by in-source
fragmentation without the use of serum depletion or multidimensional
chromatography. In addition we identified 994 isomers peaks (based
on LC separation) and confirmed 143 as glycans with in-source fragmentation
verification ions. The GlyQ-IQ software also enabled confirmation
of several glycan compositions in addition to those with enough intensity
for MS/MS fragmentation. These advances enabled the first report and
direct measurement of families of polysialylated glycans in human
serum using mass spectrometry. Measuring polysialylated glycan compositions
provided a foundation for follow-up glycan structure and glycoprotein
site localization studies. Serum polysialylated glycans or the attached
glycoproteins may serve as a source for disease related biomarkers
circulating in the blood, as the disruption of metabolism observed
in diabetes, cancer,18,19,32,33 and other disease may be reflected in altered
glycosylation of circulating proteins.
