Epigenetic
studies increasingly require analysis of a small number
of cells that are of one specific type and derived from patients or
animals. In this report, we demonstrate a simple microfluidic device
that integrates sonication and immunoprecipitation (IP) for epigenetic
assays, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylated
DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). By incorporating an ultrasonic transducer
with a microfluidic chamber, we implemented microscale sonication
for both shearing chromatin/DNA and mixing/washing of IP beads. Such
integration allowed highly sensitive tests starting with 100 cross-linked
cells for ChIP or 500 pg of genomic DNA for MeDIP (compared to 106–107 cells for ChIP and 1–10 μg
of DNA for MeDIP in conventional assays). The entire on-chip process
of sonication and IP took only 1 h. Our tool will be useful for highly
sensitive epigenetic studies based on a small quantity of sample.

==== Body
Epigenetics
focuses on molecular
mechanisms that change gene activity and expression without alteration
in DNA sequence.1 Epigenetic mechanisms
include histone modifications, DNA methylation, nucleosome positions,
and expression of noncoding RNA. Histones are subject to a variety
of post-translational modifications (e.g., methylation and acetylation)
within their amino-terminal tails. DNA methylation leads to the addition
of a methyl group at the carbon-5 position of cytosine residues within
CpG dinucleotides, forming 5-methylcytosine (5mC). These epigenetic
modifications have profound influences on gene expression by changing
chromatin structures and creating binding sites for effector proteins.

Immunoprecipitation (IP) has been the most important approach for
identifying and studying epigenetic changes, such as histone modification
and DNA methylation, both at specific loci and at the genome-wide
level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is the technique
of choice for examining histone modifications in living cells or tissues.2−5 Typical ChIP assays involve gathering of a large number of cells
(∼106–107 cells), fixation by
cross-linking reagents (e.g., formaldehyde) to covalently attach histone
to DNA sequence, cell lysis, immunoprecipitation of the modified histone
of interest, reversal of cross-linking, digestion of the histone,
and finally qPCR amplification/identification of the enriched and
purified DNA. A similar process has been used for DNA methylation
analysis. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) uses a monoclonal
antibody specific for 5mC to target single-stranded methylated DNA
fragments during immunoprecipitation and identifies these fragments
using qPCR.6−9 Both ChIP and MeDIP can be coupled with next generation sequencing
to generate profiles of genome-wide epigenetic changes.

Despite
their broad applications, conventional ChIP or MeDIP assays
require a large number of cells (106∼107 cells for ChIP, 1–10 μg of DNA for MeDIP) as the starting
material. Such low sensitivity was largely due to low efficiency in
collecting immunoprecipitated DNA and loss of materials during various
steps of the complicated and manual procedures. The sample size limitation
largely prevents applying these assays to a broad range of primary
samples from patients and animals that come in very small quantities
despite their direct biomedical relevance. There have been numerous
works in recent years that address these issues to improve ChIP and
MeDIP sensitivity.10−14

Microfluidics has been explored by other groups and us for
conducting
epigenetic assays with high sensitivity via drastic reduction in the
volume and a high level of integration and automation.15−18 Ultrasensitive 50-cell ChIP-qPCR and 100-cell ChIP-seq were demonstrated
in our earlier works.16,18 Despite the success, continued
improvement will require further integration of additional steps in
the microfluidic platform. Chromatin/DNA fragmentation is a critical
step involved in ChIP and MeDIP. These assays require a size range
of 100–600 bp for the fragments. The fragment size critically
affects the results: small fragments lead to low signal due to breaks
within amplicons, whereas large fragment sizes lead to low resolution
and high background signal. Both enzymatic digestion (using micrococcal
nuclease) and sonication have been used for shearing chromatin/DNA.
Enzymatic fragmentation suffers from biases toward certain chromatin
regions or sequence-specific cleavage.19 Thus, sonication is much more widely used in epigenetic assays.
Microchip sonication was previously reported for shearing λ-DNA
and cross-linked chromatin with the integrity of protein epitopes
verified by immunoblotting after the procedure.20 However, there has been no report of microscale sonication
of cross-linked cells or integrated immunoprecipitation assays. None
of the previous microfluidic ChIP assays incorporated sonication for
chromatin/DNA shearing. Either enzymatic fragmentation15,16,21 or off-chip sonication18 that handles >100 μL volumes was implemented.

Here, we describe a novel microfluidic device that integrates a
composite piezoelectric transducer for both on-chip sonication and
acoustofluidic IP/washing. The piezoelectric transducer was actuated
at its resonant frequency and generated lamb wave (a type of transverse
wave) in a neighboring microfluidic chamber for either shearing chromatin/DNA
(at high intensity Vpeak > 20 V) or
enhancing
microscale mixing/washing (at low intensity Vpeak ∼ 10 V). The microfluidic chamber contained microscale
crescent-shaped structures for enhancing cavitation and acoustic streaming.
We demonstrated microfluidic epigenetic assays starting from as few
as 100 cross-linked cells (for ChIP) or 500 pg of genomic DNA (for
MeDIP). Histone modification (H3K4me3) and DNA methylation (5-mC)
in GM 12878 cells (a lymphoblastoid cell line) at specific loci were
examined by qPCR in these experiments. The on-chip processes (including
sonication, IP, and washing) required around 40 min. This integrated
device presents high potential for epigenetic assays starting from
small quantities of samples.

Materials and Methods
Fabrication of the Microfluidic
Device
The microfluidic
device was fabricated out of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using soft
lithography.22 Briefly, a photomask was
generated with microscale patterns designed by computer-aided design
software FreeHand MX (Macromedia) and printed with high resolution
(5,080 dpi) on a transparency. The master was made of a negative photoresist
SU-8 2075 (95 μm thick, Microchem) spin-coated on a 3 in. silicon
wafer (University Wafer). PDMS at a mass ratio of 10:1 RTV615 A/RTV615
B (General Electric silicone RTV 615, MG chemicals) was poured onto
the master in a Petri dish to generate an ∼5 mm thick PDMS
layer. The PDMS layer was solidified by baking at 80 °C for 2
h, peeled off from the master, and punched to produce inlet and outlet
holes. Glass slides were treated in a basic solution (5:1:1 H2O/27% NH4OH/30% H2O2 volumetric
ratio) at 75 °C for 2 h, rinsed with ultrapure water, and then
thoroughly blown dry. The PDMS layer and the precleaned glass slide
were treated with oxygen plasma and immediately brought into contact
against each other to form a sealed device. Finally, the assembled
device was baked at 80 °C for 1 h to improve bonding between
PDMS and glass.

Cell Sample Preparation
GM12878
cells were obtained
from Coriel Institute for Medical Research and used in our previous
research.18 The cell line was tested for
mycoplasma contamination using ABI MycoSEQ mycoplasma detection assay
(Applied Biosystems). Cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 (11875-093,
Gibco) plus 15% fetal bovine serum (26140-079, Gibco), 100 U penicillin
(15140-122, Gibco), and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (15140-122, Gibco)
at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured every 2 days to maintain them in the exponential
growth phase.

ChIP: Harvested cells were centrifuged at 300
g for 5 min and resuspended in culture medium. The concentration of
cells in the medium was measured using a hemocytometer. A specific
number of cells (ranging from 100–10,000) were cross-linked
in 150 μL of culture medium by adding 10 μL of 16% formaldehyde
(28908, Thermo Scientific) for 5 min, and the cross-linking was then
terminated by adding 8.4 μL of 2.5 M freshly made glycine and
incubating for 5 min at room temperature. The cross-linked cells were
then pelleted and resuspended in 8 μL of ChIP IP buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% (w/v)
sodium doxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton-100X with freshly added
1 mM PMSF (78830-1G, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail
(PIC) (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich)) and loaded into the microfluidic device.

MeDIP: Genomic DNA (gDNA) from 106 GM 12878 cells was
extracted and purified using QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (51104, Qiagen).
Extracted gDNA was dissolved in 200 μL of ultrapure water before
use. gDNA aliquots of various sizes (ranging from 500 pg to 50 ng)
generated from the stock were dissolved in 8 μL of MeDIP buffer
(10 mM monobasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, 10 mM dibasic sodium
phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Triton-100X) and denatured at
97 °C for 15 min. Denatured DNA solution was then loaded into
the microfluidic device. DNA concentrations were measured using a
Qubit 2.0 fluorometer with ssDNA HS Assay kit (Q10212, Life Technologies).

Setup of the Microfluidic Device for ChIP/MeDIP
A schematic
and an optical image of the microfluidic device are shown in Figure 1. A Langevin-type
transducer (MPI-2525D-60H, purchased from UltrasonicsWorld, manufactured
by M.P. Interconsulting) was mounted to the glass slide of the microfluidic
chip using two-component epoxy glue (2-Ton Epoxy, Devcon) and cured
overnight at room temperature. The distance between the center of
the microfluidic chamber and that of the transducer was ∼2.5
cm. A function generator (4011A, BK Precision) was used to generate
an AC signal that was amplified by a high-power ultrasonic driver/amplifier
(PDUS200, Micromechatronics). The amplified AC signal could be switched
on/off by a LabVIEW programmed relay (5501, Coto Technology) via a
data requisition card (NI SCB-68, National Instruments). The signal
drove the transducer at its resonant frequency. Sine-wave AC was used
unless otherwise stated. The working voltage (set by the user) and
current of the amplifier were monitored using a digital oscilloscope
(2530, BK precision) via a built-in monitor port on the ultrasonic
amplifier. The resonant frequency of the device was slightly shifted
from the fundamental resonant frequency of the transducer (60 kHz)
due to bonding to the microfluidic device. The working resonant frequency
(in the range of 59–62 kHz) was pinpointed by tracking the
frequency that yielded the maximum output current. To monitor the
temperature of the microfluidic chamber, a cement-on surface thermocouple
(CO1-T, Omega Engineering) was attached to the glass substrate of
the microfluidic chamber (i.e., the surface area that was separated
from the microfluidic chamber only by the slide thickness of ∼1
mm). The detected temperature was displayed and recorded by a temperature
controller (CN8202, Omega Engineering). The microfluidic device was
placed on a frozen ice pack during sonication for cooling. The LabVIEW-programmed
relay automatically switched on/off the transducer to make it work
in 10 s cycles with sonication on for a fraction of each cycle (3
s sonication time per cycle unless otherwise stated) to avoid overheating.

Figure 1 A schematic
of the integrated system for on-chip sonication and
IP. The ultrasonic transducer was bonded to the glass substrate of
the microfluidic chip using epoxy glue. The microscale crescent shapes
in the chamber are shown in the schematic as well as in the inset
microscopic image. Scale bar is 1 mm.

Preparation of Immunoprecipitation (IP) Beads
Superparamagnetic
Dynabeads Protein A (2.8 μm, 30 mg/mL, 10001D, Invitrogen) were
used for immunoprecipitation; 150 μg (5 μL of the original
suspension) of beads were washed twice with freshly prepared ChIP/MeDIP
buffer and resuspended in 150 μL of ChIP/MeDIP buffer, which
contained an antibody (against H3K4me3, 07-473, Millipore or 5-mC,
61255, Active Motif) at 6 μg/mL. Beads were gently mixed with
the antibody at 4 °C on a rotator mixer at 24 rpm for 1 h. Antibody-coated
beads were washed twice with the ChIP/MeDIP buffer and resuspended
in 2 μL of the same buffer.

Microfluidic ChIP/MeDIP
In all steps involving sonication,
sine-wave AC and 3 s sonication time per 10 s cycle were used. First,
cross-linked cells or gDNA suspended in 8 μL of ChIP buffer
(PMSF and PIC freshly added) or MeDIP buffer was loaded into the microfluidic
chamber using a pipet via the inlet. After cell/gDNA loading, the
inlet and outlet were tightly sealed using an adhesive and transparent
sealing tape (Microseal “B” adhesive seals, Bio-Rad)
to avoid solution loss during sonication. Then, the transducer was
driven at its resonant frequency with high acoustic intensity (ChIP: Vpeak = 25 V and 30 cycles; MeDIP: Vpeak = 20 V and 18 cycles) to perform on-chip chromatin/DNA
shearing.

After shearing, precoated magnetic IP beads were loaded
into the microfluidic chamber under magnetic force generated by a
cylindrical permanent magnet (NdFeB, D48-N52, 0.25 in. diameter and
0.5 in. thickness, K&J Magnetics). After bead loading, the transducer
was actuated with low acoustic intensity (Vpeak = 10 V; 180 cycles) to perform acoustic streaming-enhanced IP. The
IP process was finished in 30 min.

After IP, the magnetic IP
beads were retained inside the chamber
using the magnet, and the solution was replaced by a washing buffer.
For ChIP experiments, a low-salt washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0,150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton-100X) was used.
For MeDIP experiments, MeDIP buffer was used. After filling of the
washing buffer, the transducer was actuated with low acoustic intensity
(Vpeak = 10 V, 12 cycles) for 2 min to remove nonspecific
adsorption. The acoustic-streaming-enhanced washing step was then
repeated once using a high-salt washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton-100X) for ChIP
experiments and the MeDIP buffer for MeDIP experiments. Finally, the
IP beads were collected out of the microfluidic chamber into a 0.6
mL LoBind Eppendorf tube containing 100 μL of either ChIP buffer
or MeDIP buffer using a pipet and under the direction of the magnet.
To generate input DNA, we conducted the same processes without undergoing
the IP step. The microfluidic chip was cooled by placing it on a frozen
ice pack during sonication.

Extraction of ChIP/MeDIP DNA
ChIP/MeDIP
samples (either
IP sample or input sample) were purified using Ipure kit (C03010012,
Diagenode) following the manufacturer protocol. Purified ChIP/MeDIP
DNA was dissolved in 10 μL of DNase-free water and used directly
for ChIP-qPCR.

Chromatin/DNA Fragment Size Analysis Using
Gel Electrophoresis
Chromatin/gDNA fragments were processed
by IPure kit to extract
DNA. Purified DNA was dissolved in 10 μL of water and analyzed
on GelRed (41003, Biotium) stained 1% agarose gel.23−25 The size of
the bands was determined using 100–3000 bp DNA ladders (170–8206,
Bio-Rad).

Real-Time PCR
Real-time PCR was conducted using iQ
SYBR Green Supermix (1708882, Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 real-time PCR machine
(Bio-Rad) with C1000Tm thermal cycler base. All PCR assays were performed
using the following thermal cycling profile: 95 °C for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles of (95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 40 s,
72 °C for 30s). Primer concentrations were 400 nM. All primers
were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies. ChIP-qPCR/MeDIP-qPCR
results were represented as relative fold enrichment, which is the
ratio of percent input between a positive locus and a selected negative
locus. Percent input was computed using the equation  where Ctinput and CtIP are the Ct values (a cycle threshold (Ct) value
is determined by
the intersection of an amplification curve and a threshold line) of
input and ChIP/MeDIP DNA, respectively; dilution factor (DF) is defined
as (sample volume of input + sample volume of IP)/(sample volume of
input).18

Results
Design and
Operation of the Microfluidic Sonication Device
The microfluidic
sonication system, as shown in Figure 1, consists of several major
components: (1) A function generator driving an alternating current
(AC) signal that was amplified by a signal amplifier. The amplified
signal actuated a Langevin transducer that was bound on the glass
surface of a PDMS/glass microfluidic chip. (2) The Langevin transducer
has a structure consisting of piezoelectric elements “sandwiched”
between two pieces of metal and generates much higher acoustic power
than regular piezo transducers.26 Such
high acoustic energy transferred into the microfluidic chamber via
the glass substrate in the form of a transverse acoustic wave.20,27 (3) A circular microfluidic chamber had a diameter of 12 mm, a depth
of 95 μm, and a volume of 7.7 μL. One inlet and one outlet
were created to have reagents and materials in and out of the chamber.

With actuation of the transducer, solution in the microfluidic
chamber was subjected to a rapid change of pressure. If the amplitude
of pressure change is beyond a certain threshold, small air bubbles
that are originally dissolved in the liquid can rapidly collapse.
This process is referred to as inertial cavitation and is the main
cause of chromatin/DNA fragmentation by sonication.28,29 Because cavitation initiates at the gas–liquid interface,
we increased intensity of cavitation by adding microscale crescent-shaped
structures, as shown in the inset image of Figure 1. These microscale crescent PDMS structures
enhanced cavitation in several ways: First, these crescent structures
entrapped air (as solution flowed in from the inlet), thus increasing
the air–liquid interface.30 Second,
hydrophobicity of PDMS lowered the nucleation energy barrier compared
to that with a hydrophilic surface31 and
promoted cavitation by creating nanobubbles of sizes close to critical
radii for bubble nucleation.31−33 Third, the sharp tip of the crescent
structures significantly promoted cavitation and acoustic streaming
(required by subsequent steps of mixing and washing). We used an angle
of 12° for the tip based on optimization in previous works.34,35

Figure 2 shows
cavitation
inside devices of different designs and under various sonication conditions.
Cavitation was only present close to the edge of the chamber when
there were no crescent structures (Figure 2a and Video S1). In comparison, the microscale crescent structures generated significantly
more cavitation (Figure 2b–f). As we increased sine AC voltage from 17 to 25 V, there
was increased cavitation, and at 25 V, air bubbles originated from
various connected crescent shapes and covered a large area of the
chamber due to complex interplay of primary and secondary Bjerknes
forces (Figure 2b,
c and Video S2).36 We also tested the performance under different waveforms (i.e.,
square, sine, and triangle waves) generated by the function generator.
As shown in Figure 2d–f, at the same frequency and voltage, square wave (Figure 2d) generated the
strongest acoustic cavitation, and triangle wave generated the least
cavitation (Figure 2f). This trend can be explained by the relative magnitude of time-averaged
power for various waveforms, when VPeak is the same (i.e., square > sine > triangle for Ptime averaged). We chose to use sine wave for subsequent experiments due to the
fact that it offered the best consistency and stability for transducer
operation.

On-Chip Sonication of Cross-Linked
Cells and Genomic DNA
In ChIP, cells are typically cross-linked
using formaldehyde to capture
protein–DNA interactions. Cells after cross-linking are hard
to lyse chemically.37 Thus, sonication
in a buffer containing an ionic detergent such as SDS is typically
required for complete release and shearing of chromatin.37,38

We demonstrated the performance of our device for sonication-based
chromatin shearing starting from cross-linked cells. The on-chip sonication
was performed in the ChIP buffer that contained 0.1% SDS (compared
to 1% SDS in common sonication buffers) to avoid adverse effects on
the downstream ChIP assay. Cells maintained their physical shape before
sonication (Figure 3a). After on-chip sonication for 6 cycles (each 10 s cycle has 3
s sonication and 7 s rest period) (Figure 3b), cells rapidly disintegrated with debris
and nuclei remaining. After on-chip sonication for 12 cycles (Figure 3c), there were no
sizable pieces left, and this suggested complete chromatin release
from nuclei. We also examined chromatin shearing under various sonication
conditions by resolving DNA fragment size using gel electrophoresis
(Figure 3d–f).
Both sonication intensity and cycle number critically affected fragment
size and distribution of sheared chromatin. We first confirmed that
the crescent microstructures substantially enhanced chromatin fragmentation
(Figure 3d). Furthermore,
in the devices with the crescent shapes, we observed a steady decrease
in the fragment size from 100 to 3000 bp to 100–500 bp when
we increased Vpeak (that supported the
transducer) from 15 to 25 V (Figure 3e). With fixed sonication intensity (Vpeak), fragmentation of chromatin also increased with
larger cycle number (i.e., longer overall duration) (Figure 3f). Finally, we also demonstrated
that the on-chip sonication shearing was effective for shearing purified
genomic DNA that is typically the starting material in MeDIP experiments
(Figure 3g). Compared
with sonication of cross-linked cells, shearing genomic DNA required
much less acoustic energy to generate a similar fragment size; 100–500
bp was the optimal fragment size range for DNA and was produced under
20 V for 18 cycles (compared to 25 V for 30 cycles when cross-linked
cells were the starting material). Our on-chip sonication showed good
reproducibility (Figure 3g shows repeats for 20 V/18 cycles).

under various sonication conditions measured by gel electrophoresis
(Vpeak of 15–25 V, 12–24
cycles); 200 ng of genomic DNA was used in each experiment.

Integrated Sonication and
ChIP/MeDIP Assay
Our simple
device permitted integration of sonication-based shearing and immunoprecipitation.
Thus, we were able to conduct ChIP or MeDIP directly from cross-linked
cells or purified genomic DNA, respectively, using the device. Figure 4 shows the process
for ChIP, and the MeDIP process is very similar with the exception
of starting with single-stranded gDNA. Briefly, cross-linked cells
or single-stranded genomic DNA were loaded into the microfluidic chamber
for on-chip sonication-based shearing (Vpeak > 20 V) first (Figure 4a, b). After generation of chromatin or DNA fragments, beads
that
were coated with a specific antibody (H3K4me3 antibody in the case
of ChIP or 5-mC antibody in the case of MeDIP) were loaded into the
microfluidic chamber under magnetic force generated by a permanent
magnet (Figure 4c).
Then, low-intensity acoustic wave (that does not induce cavitation)
was applied (with Vpeak = 10 V) to generate
acoustic streaming (Video S3 and S4) to enhance mixing of beads and solution while
keeping nonspecific adsorption minimal (Figure 4d). During this period (30 min), immunoprecipitation
(either ChIP or MeDIP) was finished. After immunoprecipitation, magnetic
beads were retained inside the chamber by the magnet, whereas a washing
buffer was used to flush untargeted chromatin/DNA and other impurities
out of the chamber (Figure 4e). A wash step was then conducted under acoustic streaming
to further remove nonspecific adsorption from the bead surface (Figure 4f, g). After washing,
the magnetic beads were collected out of the chamber for downstream
purification and analysis (Figure 4h). The entire on-chip processing time was approximately
40 min, and the IP step took only 30 min.

steps b–f. In all steps involving sonication (or acoustic streaming),
sine-wave AC and 3 s sonication time per 10 s cycle were used.

Heat management was an important
consideration in our device operation.
On-chip sonication generated a substantial amount of heat and the
rise in the temperature particularly affected IP results by damaging
protein/antibody. We placed the microfluidic chip on top of a frozen
ice pack during sonication. We also conducted sonication in short
intervals with periods of sonication off to facilitate cooling. We
obtained temperature profiles of the microfluidic chamber over time
under various sonication conditions (ranging from 1 to 9 s sonication
time out of each 10 s cycle) (Figure 5a). There was no substantial temperature increase when
there was sonication for 1s during a 10 s cycle. However, when the
sonication time in each cycle increased to 3, 5, and 9 s, there was
an increasingly sharp temperature rise at the beginning of the process.
In all cases, the temperature eventually reached a plateau (17.2,
38.1, and 66.7 °C for 3, 5, and 9 s, respectively).

Figure 5 Effect of temperature
rise on ChIP-qPCR results. (a) Variation
over time in the substrate temperature at the location of the microfluidic
chamber under various sonication conditions. The measurement was conducted
during 30 cycle sonication with a Vpeak of 25 V. The sonication time in each 10 s cycle was varied from
1 to 9 s; 10,000 cross-linked GM12878 cells were used in each experiment.
The data points were the average of two replicates. The data points
are connected to guide the eye. (b–e) ChIP-qPCR results corresponding
to various temperature profiles in (a).

We tested how the temperature rise affected ChIP results.
We used
ChIP-qPCR to measure the percent input at known positive and negative
loci for H3K4me3 (with the primer sequences listed in Table S1). We found that the enrichment of ChIP
DNA was critically affected by our sonication protocol. When a 1 s
sonication time was used in a 10 s cycle, there was high percent input
at all loci (Figure 5b). This result suggests incomplete chromatin fragmentation that
created false positives. By increasing the sonication time to 3 s
in a 10 s cycle, the temperature of the glass substrate at the location
of the microfluidic chamber increased to around 17.2 °C (Figure 5a). The enrichment
of ChIP DNA was significantly improved as percent inputs at two positive
loci (UNKL and C9orf3) were above 25%, whereas the ones at two negative
loci (N1 and N2) were around 1% (i.e., a relative fold enrichment
of 25) (Figure 5c).
However, further increasing the sonication time to 5s led to decreased
percent input in one of the positive loci (C9orf3) from 25 to 7.5%
and an increase at the two negative loci (to 4 and 2.5%) (Figure 5d), likely due to
increased temperature (38.1 °C). Elevated temperature degrades
proteins (both histone and antibody) and potentially de-cross-links
the protein and DNA.38,39 This is confirmed by loss of
most signal in the positive loci when the sonication time and temperature
were further increased to 9 s and 66.7 °C, respectively (Figure 5e). Thus, our results
indicated that 3 s sonication in a 10 s cycle (for 30 cycles) was
optimal for ChIP starting from cross-linked cells.

We demonstrated
that our device permitted sensitive and integrated
ChIP and MeDIP tests (with primer sequences listed in Table S1 and S2) based on a small quantity of
cells/DNA (Figure 6). Using the optimized protocol, we tested with various samples ranging
from 10,000 down to 100 cross-linked cells on the microfluidic device.
The identification of H3k4me3 at specific loci was conducted off-chip
using qPCR. With decreasing cell sample size, the fold enrichment
at positive loci (UNKL and C9orf3, in reference to the negative locus
N2) varied from 34 and 22 to 18 and 14, respectively (Figure 6a). Such a decrease in the
enrichment was expected due to the decreased amount of targeted chromatin
with smaller sample sizes and increased nonspecific adsorption of
untargeted chromatin. Nevertheless, the enrichment of 18 and 14 with
only 100 cells was more than sufficient for differentiating positive
from negative loci. The enrichment of 27 and 17 at UNKL and C9orf3
with 1000 cells were slightly lower than the optimized results obtained
using MOWChIP (i.e., 37 and 19).18 Thus,
the two approaches appeared to generate results of similar quality.
Using the same device, we also started with various amounts of single-stranded
genomic DNA (50 ng, 5 ng, and 500 pg) to conduct an on-chip MeDIP
assay with the same procedure except with a lower sonication intensity
for shearing. We tested two known positive loci (SNRPN and MAGEA1
promoters) and two negative loci (GABRB3 and GAPDH promoters) with
MeDIP followed by qPCR.40 The relative
fold enrichment values at the two positive loci were 58 and 34 even
with 500 pg DNA, confirming the high data quality.

Discussion
Several features of our
device permit its
use for sensitive and rapid epigenetic assays. First, we integrate
sonication of cells/DNA with the rest of the procedures so that we
can start with tiny amounts of cross-linked cells or genomic DNA.
In this case, we fully take advantage of the small volume of a microfluidic
chamber to avoid dilution in tubes and material loss during transfer.
Second, acoustic streaming is used to facilitate both mixing (of chromatin/DNA
and beads) and washing (to remove nonspecific adsorption) at the microscale.
Acoustic streaming facilitates transport of molecules and promotes
their interaction with the bead surface by reducing the thickness
of diffusion boundary layers. A low-amplitude acoustic wave also allows
removal of nonspecific binding without compromising specific binding.41,42 These steps are critical for generating ChIP or MeDIP DNA of high
quality. Third, our assays are rapid. The on-chip procedures can be
finished in less than 1 h, and the entire ChIP/MeDIP assay takes less
than 3 h including off-chip protein digestion/DNA purification (0.5
h) and qPCR (1.5 h). In particular, the immunoprecipitation step is
shortened to 30 min. Taken together, our device offers a new platform
for performing immunoprecipitation-based epigenetic assays with high
level of integration and sensitivity. Our device will greatly facilitate
studies of scarce samples derived from patients and small lab animals.
