Phage
display-mediated immuno-polymerase chain reaction (PD-IPCR)
is an ultrasensitive detection technology that combines the advantages
of immuno-PCR and phage display. The phage particle, which displayed
antibody fragments including single-chain fragment variable (scFv),
variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies (VHH), and antigen-binding
fragment (Fab) on the surface can be directly used in IPCR, supplying
both the detection antibody and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template.
In this work, we used ochratoxin A (OTA) as a model system to study
the capacity of PD-IPCR in the detection of toxic small molecular
weight compounds, especially mycotoxins. An alpaca-derived VHH library
was constructed and subjected to four cycles of panning. In total,
16 clones with four unique sequences were selected by competitive
binding with OTA. The clone VHH-28 resulted in the lowest 50% inhibitory
concentration of 0.31 ng/mL in the phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and was selected to develop the VHH phage-based real-time
immuno-PCR (RT-IPCR). The detection limit of the VHH phage-based RT-IPCR
was 3.7 pg/L, with a linear range of 0.01–1000 pg/mL. This
method was compared with conventional ELISA, and validation results
indicated the reliability of VHH phage-based RT-IPCR in the detection
of OTA in cereal samples. This study provides a new idea for the ultrasensitive
detection of mycotoxins and other toxic small molecular weight compounds.

==== Body
Ochratoxin A (OTA), a secondary
metabolite of several Aspergillus and Penicillium fungal species,1 is a common food contaminant that can enter the human body through
the consumption of improperly stored food products. OTA is a potent
toxin that can produce nephrotoxic, teratogenic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic,
and immunosuppressive activity.2−6 In humans, OTA is classified as a possible carcinogen (group 2B)
by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).7 OTA contamination occurs worldwide,8−12 which seriously threatens public health. Hence, there is an urgent
need in the food industry for sensitive, specific, and rapid methods
to monitor for the presence of OTA.

Many studies have been performed
to develop methods for OTA determination,
including immunoassay, instrumental analysis, and combined methods.13−16 Neverthless, instrumental methods are time-consuming and expensive
for sample preparation and analysis. Alternatively, immunoassays,
such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are generally used
to screen a mass of samples within a relatively short time. With the
advantages of easy preparation and lack of toxicity, phage have been
widely applied for mycotoxin detection as a reagent in ELISA.17−19 Phage have also been reported to be very suitable for immuno-PCR,20−23 a powerful technology combining the high specifity and ultrasensitivity
of PCR.

Phage display-mediated immuno-polymerase chain rection
(PD-IPCR),
first described by Zhang and co-workers,20 is a highly promising technique for ultrasensitive analysis of antigens.
The phage-displayed antibody fragment (VHH, scFv, Fab) and phage DNA
can directly act as the detection antibody and PCR template, respectively.
Therefore, it can avoid the time-consuming and costly preparation
of a monoclonal antibody–reporter DNA conjugate, which is required
in conventional IPCR. It has been reported that a noncompetitive format
can be used for the detection of molecules in PD-IPCR, including noncompetitive
phage anti-immunocomplex real-time (RT) PCR21 and phage-based open-sandwich immuno-PCR.24 However, there are no reports on the competitive format of PD-IPCR.
In this study, we report the generation of OTA-specific VHH phage
from an immunized alpaca VHH library and the application of VHH phage-based
competitive RT-IPCR for ultrasensitive detection of OTA in cereal
samples.

Alpaca Immunization
OTA–KLH
conjugates (immunogen)
and OTA–OVA conjugates (coating antigen) were prepared by covalently
attaching the carboxylic acid of OTA to a carrier protein as described
by Kawamura et al.25 A 3-year-old male
alpaca was immunized by subcutaneous, lower back injection of OTA–KLH
(250 μg) diluted in 0.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
mixed with 0.5 mL of Freund’s complete adjuvant. A second injection,
3 weeks after the first, was followed by three injections every 2
weeks for a total of five immunizations. Samples of fresh blood (20
mL) were collected 1 week after the fourth and fifth immunization,
from which the peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated with the
human peripheral lymphocyte separation medium, respectively. The lymphocytes
were stored at −80 °C until used for total RNA extraction.

Library Construction
Total RNA was extracted from the
peripheral blood lymphocytes by use of the RNAiso Plus following the
manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand complementary DNA
(cDNA) was derived from total RNA by use of a first-strand cDNA synthesis
kit. The heavy chains of the heavy-chain antibody (HCAb) were amplified
by PCR using PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase with sense and antisense
primers AlpVh-LD (CTT GGT GGT CCT GGC TGC) and CH2-R (GGT
ACG TGC TGT TGA ACT GTT CC), respectively. After amplification, doublet
PCR bands between 635 and 740 bp corresponding to HCAb were agarose-gel-purified.
Gene-specific primers AlpVh-SfiI (TCG CGG CCC AGC
CGG CCA TGG CCC AGK TGC AGC TCG TGG AGT CNG GNG G), AlpVHHR1-NotI (CGA GTG CGG CCG CGG GGT CTT CGC TGT GGT GCG), and
AlpVHHR2-NotI (CGA GTG CGG CCG CTT GTG GTT TTG GTG
TCT TGG G) were used to amplify the VHH gene and add SfiI and NotI restriction enzyme sites flanking the
5′ and 3′ termini of VHH coding sequences, respectively.
The resulting PCR products were purified with TIANgel midi purification
kit and digested with Sfi I and Not I restriction enzymes. Amplified VHH DNA were pooled and ligated
into the pHEN1 vector at 3:1 molar ratio by use of T4 DNA ligase.
The recombinant plasmid was introduced into competent cells of E. coli TG1 by electroporation and the cells were
plated on 2YT–ampicillin agar plates. Transformants were scraped
off the plates and stored in 2YT plus 25% glycerol at −80 °C
until further use. The resulting library had an estimated size of
2 × 107 independent clones.

VHH Library Panning
The phage-displayed VHH library
[100 μL, 2 × 1012 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL]
was subjected to four cycles of panning in 96-well microtiter plates.
The antigen well was incubated with 10.0, 7.5, 5.0, and 2.5 μg
of OTA–OVA conjugate for cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 overnight at
4 °C. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 300
μL of blocking buffer [3% (w/v) OVA in PBS] for 1 h at 37 °C.
To avoid selection of OVA-binding VHH phages, the wells of a microtiter
plate coated with 100 μL of blocking buffer was used for phage
preabsorption for 1 h at 4 °C. Then the supernatant was transferred
to the antigen wells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After being
washed 12 times with PBST, the bound VHH phages of the first and second
round were eluted with 100 μL of elution buffer [0.2 M glycine
hydrochloride (pH 2.2) and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA)] and
neutralized with 15 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1), while the bound
VHH phages of the third and fourth round were competitively eluted
with OTA diluted in 1.25% methanol (50 and 5 ng/mL) by 30 min incubation
at 4 °C. The Tween-20 concentrations in PBST were 0.05%, 0.1%,
0.25%, and 0.5% for the four cycles of panning, respectively. Postabsorption
of the eluted VHH phage was performed throughout panning under the
same conditions. After each cycle of panning, eluted VHH phages were
used to infect E. coli TG1 cells for
subsequent amplification as described by Ghahroudi et al.26 Individual clones were picked randomly after
four cycles of panning and tested against the OTA–OVA conjugate
by competitive phage ELISA. Plasmid DNAs derived from the positive
VHH phage clones determined by phage ELISA were extracted and sequenced
by use of the universal primers M13-R (AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA
GGA) and pHEN-R (GCC CAT TCA GAT CCT CTT C).

Preparation of VHH Phages
The recombinant E. coli TG1 containing
the pHEN1-VHH plasmid was
inoculated into 2YT medium containing 2% (v/v) glucose and 100 μg/mL
ampicillin, followed by incubation and shaking (220 rpm) at 37 °C
until OD600 of the medium reached 0.5. After being superinfected
with helper phage M13K07 by incubation with no shaking at 37 °C
for 15 min, the culture was subjected to incubation and shaking (220
rpm) at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
and transferred to 2YT medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin
and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. VHH phages were produced by growing
the culture overnight with shaking (220 rpm) at 30 °C and titered
by determining the colony-forming units (cfu).

VHH Phage-Based Competitive
Real-Time Immuno-PCR
Wells
of a 96-well PCR plate were treated with 20 μL of 0.8% glutaraldehyde
in Milli-Q water for 5 h at 37 °C and washed six times with Milli-Q
water. The wells were coated with 20 μL of OTA–OVA conjugate
in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. After
the wells were blocked with PBS containing 3% (w/v) OVA at 37 °C
for 1 h, 10 μL of VHH phage supernatant (4 × 107 cfu) and 10 μL of serial concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1,
10, 100, and 1000 pg/mL) of OTA in 2.5% methanol–water were
added into the plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Then the
plate was washed six times with PBST followed by six washings with
Milli-Q water to remove unbound VHH phages. The bound phages were
finally quantified by real-time immuno-PCR (RT-IPCR).

RT-IPCR
was performed directly in a 96-well PCR plate by use of the 7900HT
fast real-time PCR system. Each PCR reaction (20 μL) consisted
of 2× SYBR* Premix Ex TaqII (Tli RNaseH Plus),
50× ROX reference dye, 10 μM of each primer, forward primer
phage-F1 (GGG CCG ATT CAC CAT CTC) and reverse primer phage-R1 (GCG
GAC GTA ACA GTA ATA CAC G), VHH phage, and sterilized water. A dissociation-curve
analysis was performed at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min,
and 95 °C for 15 s. The thermal cycle conditions included 95
°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s,
55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The 103-bp amplicon
encoding part of the VHH DNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

We established a VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR standard curve
using the optimized concentration of coating antigen (4 μg/mL),
input of VHH phage (4 × 107 cfu/well), and 10-fold
serial dilutions of OTA standard (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000
pg/mL) (Figure 4B). Fluorescence was detected
during PCR amplification by the 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and amplification curves of 10-fold
serial dilutions of OTA were also obtained from it.

Sample Preparation
Samples of corn, wheat, and rice
collected from a local grocery store were finely ground and stored
in the freezer at −20 °C before analysis. Sample preparation
for measurement with VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR was performed
according to the OTA ELISA kit manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 5 g of each sample was weighed into a 50 mL centrifuge tube
and extracted with 25 mL of 60% methanol in deionized water and 2
mL of petroleum ether by shaking vigorously for 5 min. Then the mixture
was centrifuged at 8000g for 5 min and the middle
liquid layer was diluted 24 times for RT-IPCR analysis and 2 times for conventional ELISA analysis, respectively.

Statistical
Analysis
A standard curve was produced
by plotting the average threshold cycle (CT) values of duplicates
against OTA concentrations with Origin version 8.0 (OriginLab Corp.,
Northampton, MA) and used for OTA quantification in the cereal samples.
The limit of detection (LOD) was obtained as the estimated OTA concentrations
that are euquivalent to the mean blank value plus 3 standard deviations
(SD) as described by Ueda and co-workers.24

Results and Discussion
Selection of OTA-Specific VHH Phages
An alpaca-derived
VHH immuno library of 2 × 107 individuals was constructed
and used to select OTA-selective VHH phages through four cycles of
panning. The number of phage output in each cycle of panning is shown
in Figure 1. In order to enrich VHH phage clones
of increasing selectivity for OTA, the bound phages were eluted by
glycine hydrochloride in the first two cycles of panning. The number
of phage output in the second panning was approximately 3 orders of
magnitude higher than in the first panning. This result indicated
the effective enrichment of specific clones in the first two cycles
of panning. It has been reported that competitive selection could
be applied for isolation of high-affinity antibodies.27,31 Hence, we performed competitive elution using low concentrations
of free OTA by adding 100 μL of 50 and 5 ng/mL OTA in 2.5% methanol–PBS
and incubating for 20 min at room temperature in the third and fourth
cycles of panning, respectively. The number of phage output of the
third panning decreased compared to the second panning, showing a
very limited amount of VHH phages with high affinity in the second
panning eluate. In total, 48 clones randomly selected from the third
and fourth cycle of panning were rescued and their capacity to bind
OTA by competitive phage ELISA was determined. We found that the 48
phage clones all showed clear but different degrees of binding inhibition
by free OTA (data not shown), indicating that our panning strategy
was effective in isolating positive VHH phage clones with high affinity
to the coating antigen. Briefly, we performed four cycles of panning
with adjustments of OTA–OVA conjugate concentration (100, 75,
50, and 25 μg/mL), Tween-20 concentration (v/v) in PBST (0.05%,
0.1%, 0.25%, and 0.5%), elution model (acid elution and competitive
elution), OTA concentration for competitive elution (50 and 5 ng/mL),
and preabsorption of phage binding OVA.

Figure 1 Phage output number:
10 μL of the phage output was diluted
in sterile LB medium from each panning cycle and mixed with 100 μL
of E. coli TG1 cells with OD600 = 0.3. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C without
shaking and then plated on a LB plate with ampicillin (100 μg/mL).
The number of colonies was counted the next day.

Sequence Alignment of Isolated VHH Phages to OTA
A
total of 3 clones after the third cycle of panning and 13 clones from
the fourth cycle of panning that showed complete inhibition of binding
to the coating antigen by free OTA were sequenced (Figure 2). In total, four unique sequences (och1, och2,
och3, and och4) were obtained from the 16 VHH phage clones (Figure 3). Interestingly, VHH-43 and VHH-44 show much lower
sensitivity in phage ELISA than the rest of clones in och1 do, while
VHH-28 (och2) and VHH-32 (och3) with different sequences have very
similar sensitivity in phage ELISA. It has been reported that the
vast majority of the rescued phage particles that display pIII–antibody
fusions will contain only a single copy.28 Besides, it has been demonstrated that monovalent display is very
essential for selecting high-affinity antibodies.29 So it can be inferred that multicopy pIII–VHH fusions
are displayed on the particle surface of VHH-43 and VHH-44, resulting
in lower sensitivity in phage ELISA. Affinity is a binding strength
between an antigenic determinant and an antigen-binding site, and
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) account for formation of
the antibody binding pocket.30 It has been
reported that VHHs with different sequences that were highly homologous
in CDRs had similar sensitivity in ELISA.31 Since VHH-28 (och1) and VHH-32 (och2) have good similarity in CDRs,
they show very similar sensitivity in phage ELISA.

Figure 2 Competitive phage ELISA
with VHH phage clones from the third and
fourth cycles of panning. The 96-well microtiter plate was coated
with 100 μL of OTA–OVA (5 μg/mL) in PBS per well
overnight at 4 °C. The mixture of VHH phage and OTA was added,
and then binding was detected with HRP/anti-M13 monoclonal conjugate.
IC50 levels varied from 0.31 ng/mL for VHH-28 (red squares)
to 42.01 ng/mL for VHH-44 (green diamonds). Clones (VHH-17, 20, 25,
27, 31, 34, 35, 36, 39, 47, and 48) that have very similar sensitivity
as VHH-15 in phage ELISA are not shown. Error bars are standard deviations
of the mean with three well replicates.

Figure 3 Alignment of amino acid sequences of selected VHH phage clones.
Sixteen clones are divided into four groups: och1 (VHH-15, 17, 20,
25, 27, 31, 34, 35, 39, 43, 44, 47, and 48), och2 (VHH-28), och3 (VHH-32),
and och4 (VHH-36). The deduced amino acid sequences of the four clones
are given in the single-letter code. (∼) Absence of amino acid
residues; (.) residues identical to those of clones in
och1.

It is clear that the framework
regions are highly conserved among
the four sequences. We can distinguish four sequences of VHH phages
according to the composition of CDRs. The CDR3 region of och1 contains
15 amino acids, which is the longest in the four sequences. och2 and
och3 both exhibit excellent sensitivity in the competitive phage ELISA
and are highly homologous in the CDR2 region but show significant
amino acid variation in CDR3 region. Since VHH-28 in och2 has the
lowest IC50 in the phage ELISA, we chose VHH-28 for further
research.

VHH Phage-Based Competitive Real-Time Immuno-PCR
VHH
phage-based RT-PCR competitive standard curves were produced from
serial concentrations of OTA standard. The threshold cycle (CT) was
determined by setting a fluorescence threshold in the exponential
phase of the amplification curves, reading out the fractional cycle
number at which the amplication curve crossed the threshold (Figure 4A). Along with the standard
samples, a negative control containing all assay components (without
OTA) was run. A blank control containing the RT-PCR reagents only
(without VHH phage) was also included. All samples were run in triplicate.

Figure 4 VHH phage-based
competitive RT-IPCR assay of OTA. (A) OTA amplification
curves of VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR assay. Curves b–g
represent serial 10-fold dilutions of OTA from 0.01 to 1000 pg/mL.
Curves a and h are the negative control (no OTA) and blank control
(no VHH phage), respectively. (B) OTA standard curve.

It is obvious that the mean CT values for 10-fold
serial dilutions
of OTA standard from 0.01 pg/mL to 1000 pg/mL increase as the increase
of OTA concentration (Figure 4B). The standard
curve exhibited an excellent limit of detection of 3.7 pg/L and displayed
a correlation coefficient of 0.996, and this quantification proved
to be linear over a wide range of OTA standard concentrations (from
0.01 to 1000 pg/mL).

Cross-Reactivity
The specificity
of the assay was tested
for the phage clone VHH-28 by use of five common mycotoxins: ochratoxin
B (OTB), fumonisin B1 (FB1), deoxynivalenol
(DON), aflatoxin B1 (AB1), and zearalenone (ZEN)
(Figure 5). The cross-reactivity of the assay
was obtained by comparing 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50).32 Negligible cross-reactivity was observed,
except for OTB, which showed 3.5% cross-reactivity, indicating the
excellent selectivity of VHH-28 in VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR
for OTA.

Figure 5 Cross-reactivity of VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR. The 96-well
PCR plates were coated with 20 μL/well of OTA–OVA conjugate
(4 μg/mL). Serial 10-fold dilutions of (a) ochratoxin A or (b–f)
tested compounds (ochratoxin B, fumonisin B1, deoxynivalenol,
aflatoxin B1, and zearalenone) in 2.5% methanol–PBS
were mixed with an equal volume of VHH-28 (4 × 109 cfu/mL) in PBS. The mixture (20 μL/well) was then added to
wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The bound phage were detected
by RT-PCR.

Solvent Effect
OTA is a relatively nonpolar chemical
that has low solubility in water, so methanol is commonly used to
prepare OTA standards and to extract OTA from cereal samples. Since
methanol can affect the antigen–antibody interaction, we performed
a study to optimize the concentration of methanol in the final assay
buffer. A series of concentrations of OTA was diluted in 2.5%, 5%,
10%, and 20% methanol–PBS. The LOD values generated from each
dilution buffer were compared. As shown in Figure 6, there were slight differences among 5%, 10%, and 20% methanol–PBS;
however, the standard curve of VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR
in 2.5% methanol–PBS exhibited the widest linear range and
displayed the lowest LOD. So in the following analysis, 2.5% methanol–PBS
was selected to dilute the ochratoxin A standard, and the sample extract
was also diluted to a final concentration of 2.5% methanol.

(■), 5% (red circles), 10% (blue triangles), and 20% (green

± standard deviation of six replicates. Serial 10-fold dilutions
of ochratoxin A in 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 20% methanol–PBS were
mixed with equal volumes of VHH-28 (4 × 109 cfu/mL)
in PBS. The mixture (20 μL/well) was added to wells and analyzed
by VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR.

Assay Validation
A spike-and-recovery analysis was
carried out to validate the assay with the newly developed VHH phage-based
competitive RT-IPCR. Corn, wheat, and rice samples spiked with known
concentrations of ochratoxin A were tested. Recoveries of 80–126%
were obtained (Table 1).

a Determinations
were performed
by VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR and conventional ELISA.

A total of 38 domestic cereal samples
were analyzed with a commercial
ELISA kit and the VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR, respectively.
Among the 38 samples, seven (C8–C12, C14, and C15) of 18 corn
samples, five (W1–W5) of 10 wheat samples, and eight (R1–R8)
of 10 rice samples were OTA-positive as detected by VHH phage-based
competitive RT-IPCR (Table 2). In addition,
OTA was detected in 12 samples (C10, C11, C15, W1–W4, and R4–R8)
by the ELISA kit. Many more samples were determined by the VHH phage-based
RT-IPCR to be OTA-positive because of the lower LOD (3.7 pg/L) compared
to the ELISA kit (20 pg/mL). The results show that the recovery and
reproducibility of the proposed method are satisfactory.

a Determinations were performed by
VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR and commercial ELISA kit. The
limits of quantitation were 0.44 ng/kg and 0.23 μg/kg, respectively.

Conclusions
In
this study, we constructed an immunized alpaca VHH library and
four unique sequences of OTA-specific recombinant VHH fragments were
selected by four cycles of panning. It has been reported that PD-IPCR
can greatly improve the detection sensitivity, combining the advantages
of IPCR and phage display technology.20,21,23 The phage VHH-28, which showed the highest sensitivity
in phage ELISA, was chosen and applied to VHH phage-based competitive
RT-IPCR for the detection of OTA. We have shown that OTA can be detected
by VHH phage-based competitive RT-IPCR at concentrations ranging from
0.01 to 1000 pg/mL, with a detection limit of 3.7 pg/L. Validation
results from conventional ELISA and VHH phage-based RT-IPCR were in
good agreement with each other. To our knowledge, this is the most
sensitive assay reported to date for the detection of OTA. This study
indicates that VHH phage-based competitive RT-PCR has great potential
in ultrasensitive detection of mycotoxins and other toxic small molecular
compounds.
