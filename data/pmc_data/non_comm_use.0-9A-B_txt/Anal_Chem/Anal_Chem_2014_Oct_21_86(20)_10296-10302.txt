Reproducible, comprehensive phosphopeptide
enrichment is essential
for studying phosphorylation-regulated processes. Here, we describe
the application of hyper-porous magnetic TiO2 and Ti-IMAC
microspheres for uniform automated phosphopeptide enrichment. Combining
magnetic microspheres with a magnetic particle-handling robot enables
rapid (45 min), reproducible (r2 ≥ 0.80) and
high-fidelity (>90% purity) phosphopeptide purification in a 96-well
format. Automated phosphopeptide enrichment demonstrates reproducible
synthetic phosphopeptide recovery across 2 orders of magnitude, “well-to-well”
quantitative reproducibility indistinguishable to internal SILAC standards,
and robust “plate-to-plate” reproducibility across 5
days of independent enrichments. As a result, automated phosphopeptide
enrichment enables statistical analysis of label-free phosphoproteomic
samples in a high-throughput manner. This technique uses commercially
available, off-the-shelf components and can be easily adopted by any
laboratory interested in phosphoproteomic analysis. We provide a free
downloadable automated phosphopeptide enrichment program to facilitate
uniform interlaboratory collaboration and exchange of phosphoproteomic
data sets.

==== Body
Post-translational
protein phosphorylation
is an important medium for cellular signal transduction.1 Protein kinases and phosphatases are often deregulated
in disease, and pharmacological modulation of phosphorylation-dependent
signal transduction is an active area of research.2 Consequently, quantitative analysis of pathological phosphoproteomes
is of substantial interest to the biological research community.

Liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
is a powerful technology used to characterize and quantify phosphorylated
proteins. However, given the low stoichiometric abundance of phosphorylated
residues within the proteome, phosphopeptide enrichment is required
for comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis. Due to the complexity
and dynamic range of the phosphoproteome, sample prefractionation
is commonly used to obtain comprehensive coverage.3 Popular prefractionation techniques include strong cation
exchange (SCX),4 hydrophilic interaction
liquid chromatography (HILIC),5 and electrostatic
repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC).6 Subsequent affinity-based phosphopeptide enrichment
commonly employs metal dioxides (such as titanium and zirconium) or
immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC).7−11 Despite the established performance of these matrices, a limited
number of workflows have been developed for automation.12−14 Consequently, existing affinity enrichment methodologies still operate
in either manual batch-mode or as manual prepacked spin-columns.

Extensive upstream chromatographic separation massively expands
the number of samples for phosphopeptide enrichment processing. Successful
approaches to avoid prefractionation have been reported for samples
with limited input variables.15,16 However, these methods
do not facilitate the uniform parallel phosphopeptide enrichments
required for the increased numbers of biological variables/replicates
now common in phosphoproteomics. Such multivariate expansions are
further exacerbated by the contemporary trend toward multisite proteomic
projects.17−19 These endeavors require interlaboratory integration
of large sample sets and demand invariable sample processing across
disparate users. Collectively, these factors increase both the number
of simultaneous phosphopeptide enrichments required for phosphoproteomic
analysis and the demand for unified sample-to-sample enrichment.

Large-scale manual phosphopeptide enrichment suffers from limited
throughput and may inadvertently introduce sample-to-sample enrichment
bias. To address these limitations, a high-performance, easily operated,
and technically uniform method for phosphopeptide enrichment is desirable.

Here, we report the application of magnetic hyper-porous polymer
matrix microspheres for high-throughput, reproducible phosphopeptide
enrichment. We characterize the performance of both TiO2 and Ti-IMAC affinity matrices and describe how hyper-porous magnetic
microspheres can be coupled to a magnetic particle-processing robot
to facilitate automated phosphopeptide enrichment. We provide a free
downloadable program so that this method can be reproduced across
laboratories. The workflow employs noncustom, off-the-shelf equipment
and is accessible to any laboratory interested in phosphopeptide analysis.

Experimental
Section
Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment
All experiments
were performed with a KingFisher Flex (Thermo Scientific) magnetic
particle-processing robot. The automated phosphopeptide enrichment
program was developed using BindIt Software 3.0 (Thermo Scientific).
The program file has been uploaded alongside the MS/MS data (see below)
with the identifier Automated_Phosphopeptide_Enrichment.msz. This
program can be freely downloaded and run on any KingFisher Flex system.
TiO2 (MR-TID010) and Ti-IMAC (MR-TIM010) hyper-porous magnetic
microspheres were purchased from ReSyn Biosciences. The KingFisher
Flex was configured for automated phosphopeptide enrichment, as illustrated
in Figure 1a. In brief, deep-well 96-well plates
(VWR 733-3004) were assigned to each of the eight carousel positions.
Individual positions were loaded with (1) 96-well tip heads (Thermo
Scientific); (2) hyper-porous magnetic microspheres (in 100% MeCN);
(3) wash buffer 1 (80% MeCN, 5% TFA, + 1 M glycolic acid); (4) 100
μg Lys-C/trypsin digested lysate (in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA, + 1 M
glycolic acid); (5) wash buffer 1; (6) wash buffer 2 (80% MeCN, 1%
TFA); (7) wash buffer 3 (10% MeCN, 0.2% TFA); and (8) elution buffer
(1–5% NH4OH). 500 μL of the relevant buffer was added
to each well, except for the sample binding and elution steps, where
only 200 μL of sample and elution buffer were used. Unless stated
otherwise, all experiments were performed with the buffers described
above, 1 mg of magnetic microspheres, and three automated phosphopeptide
enrichment cycles. (Technical note: The amount of microspheres can
greatly affect enrichment performance.20 For maximum sample-to-sample fidelity, vortex the microsphere slurry
before aliquoting.)

Following each enrichment cycle, phosphopeptides fractions
were
immediately acidified to 0.5% TFA/10% FA, desalted using OLIGO R3
resin21 (Life Technologies 1-1339-03),
and lyophilized. Samples were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid prior
to analysis by LC-MS/MS.

Results and Discussion
Performance of Magnetic Hyper-Porous TiO2 and Ti-IMAC
Microspheres
Advances in emulsion-derived particle development
have permitted the production of hyper-porous cross-linked polymeric
lattices.22 This technology has recently
been used to generate metal-dioxide-bound magnetic microspheres for
phosphopeptide enrichment. To evaluate the phosphopeptide enrichment
performance of these matrices, TiO2, ZrO2, and
Ti-IMAC hyper-porous magnetic microspheres (MagReSyn) were compared
to established solid-bead phospho-affinity reagents (GL Science Titansphere
TiO2 and GE Healthcare MagSeph TiO2). For each
comparison, 1 mg of microspheres was combined with 500 μg of
human tryptic digest, and the manufacturer’s protocol was followed.

To track phosphopeptide retention, we first incubated each product
with 500 μg of 32P-labeled cell lysates in manual
batch mode, washed and eluted. “Unbound” (remaining
in the tube), “bound” (remaining on the microspheres),
and “eluted” 32P-containing material was
quantified using a scintillation counter (Supplementary Figure 1a, Supporting Information). Elution efficiency was
higher from magnetic Ti-IMAC (MagReSyn), followed by Titansphere TiO2 (GL) and magnetic TiO2 (MagReSyn). Both the ZrO2 (MagReSyn) and magnetic-sepharose TiO2 (GE) displayed
poorer phosphopeptide elution. Less material was retained on the hyper-porous
magnetic TiO2, ZrO2, and Ti-IMAC matrices following
elution than on the nonmagnetic TiO2 (GL) and magnetic-sepharose
TiO2 (GE).

To investigate how this behavior translated
to unique phosphopeptide
identification, we repeated these experiments and analyzed eluted
samples by LC-MS/MS. The highest numbers of unique phosphopeptides
were identified using Ti-IMAC (MagReSyn), followed by TiO2 (MagReSyn), ZrO2 (MagReSyn), Titansphere TiO2 (GL science) and MagSeph TiO2 (GE) (Supplementary Figure
1b, Supporting Information). Unfortunately,
as the total surface area and chemical composition of these reagents
is proprietary, the mechanism underlying this improved performance
is currently unclear. When compared to all other microspheres, Ti-IMAC
(MagReSyn) and TiO2 (MagReSyn) demonstrate a ∼15%
preference for acidic residues C-terminal of the phosphorylation (Supplementary
Figure 1c, Supporting Information). Conversely,
TiO2 (GL) and TiO2 (GE) display a ∼15%
bias for proline at position +1 and ∼2–5% preference
for basic residues C-terminal of the phosphorylation. This data suggests
the structural matrix supporting the primary enrichment chemistry
influences phosphopeptide affinity. In agreement with a recent comprehensive
enrichment bias study,23 Ti-IMAC (MagReSyn)
and TiO2 (MagReSyn) display minimal phosphopeptide biases.

Given their capacity to enrich substantial numbers of high-fidelity
phosphopeptides at high purity (>80%), we concluded magnetic hyper-porous
Ti-IMAC and TiO2 microspheres (MagResyn) are suitable for
high-performance phosphopeptide enrichment.

Automated Phosphopeptide
Enrichment
Given the high
performance of magnetic TiO2 and Ti-IMAC hyper-porous microspheres
in manual batch mode, we hypothesized these reagents might be applicable
to automated phosphopeptide enrichment using a magnetic particle processing
robot. To investigate this, we reformatted the manual phosphopeptide
enrichment protocol for automated use on the KingFisher Flex (Thermo
Scientific). The KingFisher Flex contains eight positions that each
hold a single deep 96-well plate. Each plate can be rotated into position
under a 96-pin magnetic head via a central carousel. Once aligned,
the 96-pin magnetic head drops down inside the 96-well plate to release,
bind, or agitate the magnetic microspheres in solution. By repeating
these steps in a user-defined sequence, the KingFisher Flex can transfer
96 magnetic microsphere samples between eight different solutions
in a fast and uniform manner. We configured this platform to perform
automated phosphopeptide enrichment by adding established phosphopeptide
enrichment buffers to each plate and writing a program to transfer
TiO2/Ti-IMAC hyper-porous microspheres between the different
plates.

Magnetic TiO2/Ti-IMAC hyper-porous microspheres
were added to one plate (position 2), Lys-C/trypsin digested samples
were added in a separate plate (position 4), phosphopeptide enrichment
wash buffers were dispensed into several plates (positions 3, 5, 6,
and 7), and ammonia elution buffer to the final plate (position 8).
We then compiled a program to collect the TiO2/Ti-IMAC
microspheres from position 2, wash the microspheres in position 3,
incubate them with the tryptic digest in position 4, wash the microspheres
(now containing bound phosphopeptides) in positions 5–7, elute
the phosphopeptides in position 8 and return the microspheres to position
2 (Figure 1a,b). This program permits the concurrent
phosphopeptide enrichment of 96 samples in 45 min. To facilitate uniform
interlaboratory operation, we have deposited the automated phosphopeptide
enrichment program alongside all LC-MS/MS data (PRIDE: PXD000892).
This program can be freely downloaded and replicated on any KingFisher
Flex system.

Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment Optimization
As
buffer composition can substantially affect enrichment performance,24 we first trialled the automated phosphopeptide
enrichment program under different binding and elution conditions.
Previous studies suggest that glycolic acid (GA) added to the binding
buffer can improve phosphopeptide enrichment efficiency from TiO2.24 However, GA is not currently
used for Ti-IMAC enrichments.25 Moreover,
while low concentrations of ammonia solution (∼1% v/v) have
been reported for elution of phosphopeptides from TiO2,21 much higher concentrations have been used for
Ti-IMAC (∼5–10% v/v).25,26 To deduce
the optimal buffer conditions for automated phosphopeptide enrichment,
we screened multiple ammonia solutions (1, 2.5, and 5 v/v) with or
without 1 M GA across both TiO2 and Ti-IMAC matrices (Supplementary
Figure 2, Supporting Information). To ensure
experiments were not limited by predicted microsphere capacity (500
μg of peptides/1 mg of microspheres), we used 20% of the recommend
tryptic digest input (100 μg of peptides/1 mg of microspheres).

First, these results confirm magnetic TiO2/Ti-IMAC hyper-porous
microspheres are applicable to robotic automated phosphopeptide enrichment.
This analysis also confirmed that GA improves phosphopeptide purity
when using TiO2 and revealed that GA has little influence
on phosphopeptide purity when using Ti-IMAC. Moreover, increasing
the ammonia concentration in the elution buffer reduces total phosphopeptide
numbers with both TiO2 and Ti-IMAC. Consequently, we opted
to use 1 M GA loading buffer and 1% ammonia elution buffer (as also
used in a manual method24) for all TiO2 and Ti-IMAC automated phosphopeptide enrichments.

Successive
Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment Cycles
Following the
completion of a single 45 min automated phosphopeptide
enrichment cycle, the KingFisher Flex robot can be immediately restarted
to perform an additional enrichment cycle. It has previously been
shown that successive rounds of manual enrichment can increase phosphopeptide
isolation.27 We subsequently hypothesized
that successive enrichment cycles influence phosphopeptide recovery
using the automated platform. To investigate this, we performed successive
automated phosphopeptide enrichments and independently analyzed the
elution from each cycle by LC-MS/MS. To investigate the influence
of increasing the amount of magnetic TiO2 and Ti-IMAC during
repeat binding, we performed this analysis with 1, 2, and 3 mg of
magnetic microspheres (Supplementary Figure 3, Supporting Information).

In all experiments, the highest
numbers of unique phosphopeptides were identified in the first cycle.
However, successive cycles continued to enrich both cumulatively unique
and nonunique phosphopeptides. Increasing the amount of magnetic microspheres
also increased the total number of uniquely identified phosphopeptides.
While additional DDA LC-MS/MS runs could explain the increase in cumulative
peptides, repeated cycles also enrich smaller, lower charge-state
phosphopeptides (Supplementary Figure 4, Supporting
Information). Although successive enrichment cycles continue
to enrich phosphopeptides, repeat bindings beyond two to three cycles
do not increase the cumulative number of unique phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide
purity decreases with each enrichment cycle and increasing microsphere
input exacerbates this deterioration. The reduction in phosphopeptide
purity is particularly pronounced when using Ti-IMAC.

As the
number of enrichable phosphopeptides will vary between different
biological samples, we advise future users of the automated phosphopeptide
enrichment protocol to validate how many cycles are required for maximum
phosphopeptide enrichment of their specific samples. We concluded
that one cycle of purification was suitable for most applications,
and two to three cycles can be used when maximum phosphopeptide recovery
is paramount.

Distinct phosphopeptide enrichment chemistries
have been reported
to enrich complementary segments of the phosphoproteome.21,28,29 We subsequently hypothesized
that the automated phosphopeptide enrichment platform could operate
with mixed TiO2 and Ti-IMAC microspheres. To investigate
this, we performed automated phosphopeptide enrichment with titrated
ratios of each microsphere matrix. Interestingly, we observed an increase
in the number of unique phosphopeptides identified from a mix of TiO2 and Ti-IMAC compared to their individual use (Supplemental
Figure 5, Supporting Information). As the
automated phosphopeptide enrichment platform can operate with any
high-performance magnetic microspheres, this protocol can be easily
adapted to employ different enrichment materials. It will be interesting
to investigate alternative chemistries (as they become available)
in future experiments.

Manual versus Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment
To
directly investigate how manual enrichment compared to the automated
platform, we simultaneously phospho-enriched 100 and 500 μg
of a consistent tryptic digest using both methods and sequentially
analyzed the samples by LC-MS/MS (Figure 1c).
This concurrent analysis demonstrated comparable phosphopeptide enrichment
between manual and automated methods. Consequently, we concluded that
the automated phospho enrichment platform performs analogous phosphopeptide
identification to existing manual methodology.

Automated Phosphopeptide
Enrichment Recovery
While
multiple approaches for phosphopeptide enrichment are currently in
use, most evaluate phosphopeptide recovery using data-dependent analysis
(DDA). As such, it can be difficult to discern whether methodological
improvements are due to differences in the phosphopeptide enrichment
protocol or in the LC-MS/MS setup. To determine phosphopeptide recovery
from the automated phosphopeptide enrichment platform, we established
a targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay to robustly quantify
a selection of human synthetic phosphopeptides (Supplementary Table
1 and Supplementary Figure 6, Supporting Information). To investigate the influence of phosphopeptide starting concentration,
5, 10, 100, and 500 fmol synthetic human phosphopeptides were spiked-in
to a SILAC “heavy” (K +8 Da; R +10 Da) complex mouse
cell-lysate tryptic digest matrix either before or after automated
phosphopeptide enrichment (Figure 2a). Percentage
recovery was calculated by comparing the intensity of each phosphopeptide
spiked-in before automated enrichment to its standard curve derived
from phosphopeptides spiked-in after enrichment (Supplementary Figure
7a, Supporting Information). Synthetic
phosphopeptides were enriched with either TiO2 (Figure 2b), Ti-IMAC (Figure 2c),
or a combination of TiO2 and Ti-IMAC (Figure 2d). Automated phosphopeptide enrichment recovered between
20 and 80% of the phosphopeptides tested with intrapeptide mean coefficient
of variation (CV) of 11–46% (Supplementary Table 2, Supporting Information). All three phosphopeptide
enrichment workflows demonstrated a reproducible, linear dynamic range
across 2 orders of magnitude (Supplementary Figure 7b and Supplementary
Table 3, Supporting Information). While
this synthetic phosphopeptide portfolio is not extensive enough to
extrapolate which phosphopeptide sequences are more suitable for Ti-IMAC
or TiO2 based enrichment, this data suggests some phosphopeptides
are more amendable to enrichment than others. Despite this sequence-specific
enrichment behavior, phosphopeptide recovery was independent of starting
concentration for all phosphopeptides. Given the robust reproducibility
and linearity of this assay, these synthetic phosphopeptides (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1, Supporting
Information) also provide an accessible common standard for
interlaboratory implementation of the automated phosphopeptide enrichment
platform.

Figure 2 Automated phosphopeptide enrichment recovery. (a) Titrated synthetic
phosphopeptides (n = 10) were spiked into 100 μg
of heavy (K +8 Da; R +10 Da) tryptic digests either (left, standard
curve) after or (right, recovery samples) before automated phosphopeptide
enrichment (technical n = 3/phosphopeptide). Synthetic
phosphopeptide abundance was then measured by SRM. Synthetic phosphopeptide

represents the mean phosphopeptide recovery (technical n = 3) when spiked-in at 5, 10, 100, or 500 fmol. (Phosphopeptide
linearity in Supplementary Table 3, Supporting
Information.) LC-MS/MS SRM runs n = 51.

Automated Phosphopeptide
Enrichment Intra-Plate Reproducibility
As the automated phosphopeptide
enrichment platform subjects each
well to identical conditions (e.g., uniform incubation times, agitation
frequencies, cycles, etc.), we hypothesized this technique enriches
well-to-well phosphopeptides in a highly reproducible manner. To investigate
intraplate fidelity, we used the automated phosphopeptide enrichment
platform to compare a “gold standard” standard SILAC
experiment (samples mixed prior to enrichment)30 with a “split” SILAC experiment (samples
combined postenrichment). To this end, we compared the relative “light”/“heavy”
ratios of two distinct SILAC populations mixed either before (premixed)
or after (postmixed) enrichment (Figure 3a)
(n = 3/group). To simulate a typical biological experiment
and evaluate the dynamic range of the workflow, light labeled cells
were treated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 5 min, and heavy labeled cells
were left untreated. In agreement with earlier experiments, this analysis
confirmed intraplate technical replicates enrich approximately equal
numbers of unique phosphopeptides at high purity (>90% phosphorylated
peptides) (Figure 3b). Crucially, correlating
the light/heavy ratios of premixed and postmixed phosphopeptide samples
showed no discernible difference in phosphopeptide enrichment fidelity
between replicates (r2 = 0.80) (Figure 3c–e). As a result, we propose automated magnetic particle
handling as a highly reproducible platform for uniform intraplate
phosphopeptide enrichment.

Figure 3 Automated phosphopeptide enrichment intra-plate
reproducibility.
(a) Light KPC cells were treated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 5 min and
SILAC heavy (K +8 Da; R +10 Da) KPC cells were left untreated. Each
SILAC population was digested separately and mixed either before (premixed,
green) or after (postmixed, blue) automated magnetic TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment. Phosphopeptides were then analyzed by
DDA LC-MS/MS. (b) Pre- and postmixed samples were randomly divided
into two groups (A and B; n = 3/group). (c–e)
The light/heavy SILAC ratios of each population were assessed by Pearson
correlation (two-tailed P < 0.0001). LC-MS/MS
DDA runs n = 12.

Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment Interplate Reproducibility
In addition to well-to-well intraplate consistency, the automated
phosphopeptide enrichment program also performs identical enrichments
across each individual cycle. As such, we hypothesized the automated
phosphopeptide enrichment method produces high plate-to-plate enrichment
reproducibility. To investigate interplate fidelity, we divided a
single unlabeled tryptic digest into 5 aliquots and performed automated
phosphopeptide enrichment on each aliquot across 5 consecutive days.
Enrichments were conducted using TiO2 (Figure 4a), Ti-IMAC (Figure 4b),
and a mixture of TiO2 and Ti-IMAC (Figure 4c; n = 3/condition/day). The respective MS1
precursor areas for each phosphopeptide were subsequently correlated
across all 5 days. This experiment confirmed interplate replicates
enrich approximately equal numbers of unique phosphopeptides at high
fidelity (>90% phosphorylated peptides). Moreover, by correlating
the MS1 precursor areas for each phosphopeptide across all 5 days,
this analysis confirmed the automated phosphopeptide enrichment platform
performs highly reproducible interplate phosphopeptide enrichment
(TiO2 x̅ r2 = 0.78, Ti-IMAC x̅ r2 = 0.81, TiO2 + Ti-IMAC x̅ r2 = 0.85). This high reproducibility suggests automated phosphopeptide
enrichment could be applicable to accurate intraplate and interplate
label-free phosphoproteomic analysis. As multiple phosphopeptide enrichments
are likely to be performed over different days during a real biological
project, this data also suggests phosphopeptides will be uniformly
enriched across multiple experiments.

Figure 4 Automated phosphopeptide enrichment interplate
reproducibility.
Daily automated phosphopeptide enrichments of a common 100 μg
sample of tryptic digest were performed across 5 consecutive days.
Enrichments were conducted using (a) 1 mg of TiO2, (b)
1 mg of Ti-IMAC, and (c) 1 mg of a mixture of TiO2 and
Ti-IMAC (n = 3/day). The respective precursor areas
for each phosphopeptide were calculated and Pearson correlated across
all 5 days. Two-tailed test for all correlations P < 0.0001. LC-MS/MS DDA runs n = 45.

Moreover, the high interplate reproducibility suggests
consistent
interlaboratory exchange of data across multiple operators is possible.
As a result, we propose automated magnetic particle handling as a
highly robust platform for reproducible interplate phosphopeptide
enrichment.

Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment For Label-Free
Quantitative
Phosphoproteomics
Given the excellent reproducibility, we
hypothesized that automated phosphopeptide enrichment can be used
for multivariate label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics. To investigate
this in a relevant biological system, we studied phosphorylation-dependent
signaling of oncogenic KRAS (KRAS-G12D) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA) cells. KRAS-G12D is the primary driving oncogenic mutation in
PDA31,32 and underpins aberrant cellular signaling.

Three distinct isolations of KRAS-G12D inducible cells (iKRAS)31 were switched between KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12D
(via doxycycline; Supplementary Figure 8, Supporting
Information) for 24 h, harvested and processed for automated
phosphopeptide enrichment. Samples were prepared in biological and
technical triplicate from each cell isolation (total unique phosphopeptide
samples n = 54) (Figure 5a).
LC-MS/MS MS1 phosphopeptide precursor area quantification revealed
broad differential phospho-regulation across all three cell isolations
following oncogenic KRAS induction (Supplementary Figure 9a, Supporting Information). Total phosphoproteomic
phenotypes resolved oncogenic genotypes in principle component analysis
(PCA) space (Figure 5b and Supplementary Figure
9b, Supporting Information). Moreover,
given the high technical reproducibility of the automated phosphopeptide
enrichment platform, combined with the ability to process multiple
technical and biological replicates, rigorous statistical analysis
of label-free phosphoproteomic data can be performed (Supplementary
Figure 9c, Supporting Information). For
example, significantly regulated MAPK1/3 phosphorylation was observed
across all biological conditions (Figure 5c).
In addition, multivariate analysis revealed phosphosites that were
consistently and significantly regulated across all three distinct
cell isolations (Figure 5d). By processing
54 samples across multiple cell lines and biological replicates, the
automated phosphopeptide enrichment platform identified a core panel
of significantly KRAS-G12D regulated phosphosites common to all PDA
cells (Supplementary Table 4, Supporting Information).

workflow. (b) PCA of label-free phosphoproteomic quantification resolves
WT and G12D KRAS genotypes. (c) Significant phosphorylated MAPK1 (T183/Y185)
and MAPK3 (T203/Y205) following oncogenic KRAS (biological replicates;

(d) Significant differentially phosphorylated peptides across all
three cell lines (two-tailed t-test <0.05). (Annotated
data in Supplementary Table 4, Supporting Information). LC-MS/MS DDA runs n = 54.

Given its ability to process large numbers of distinct biological
samples in a uniform manner, we propose automated phosphopeptide enrichment
as a robust platform for statistical investigation of multivariate
phosphoproteomic experiments.

Conclusions
As
all reagents and equipment are readily available, the reported
automated phosphopeptide enrichment platform can be easily implemented
across multiple laboratories interested in phosphoproteomic analysis.
Given the rapid (45 min), reproducible (r2 = 0.80)
and high-fidelity (>90% phosphopeptide purity) properties of this
approach, we propose automated magnetic phosphopeptide enrichment
as an easily accessible method for uniform phosphopeptide enrichment.
