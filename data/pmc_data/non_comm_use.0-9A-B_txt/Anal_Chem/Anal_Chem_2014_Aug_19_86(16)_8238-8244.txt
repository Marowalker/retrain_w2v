We have developed a panel of synthetic
glycans as receptor mimics
for the specific capture of influenza viruses. The glycans were printed
onto commercial glass slides using a free amine at the end of a spacer
to generate a small focused microarray. The microarray was evaluated
for its ability to capture three different strains of influenza A
virus, two H1N1, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and
one H3N2, A/Aichi/2/1968. We observed an excellent detection ability
with some compounds exhibiting clinically relevant (101 plaque forming units) limit of detection. We also tested the drug
susceptibility of current antivirals, Zanamivir and Ostelamivir using
this microarray and could determine antiviral resistance for these
strains.

==== Body
Influenza
virus is a respiratory
pathogen that causes over 30 000 deaths and 200 000
hospitalizations in the United States annually.1 Pandemics, like the recent 2009 H1N1 “swine flu”
can cause a significant number of infections and death in addition
to disruption of economic activity.2,3 Inexpensive,
point of care diagnosis capable of detecting the virus rapidly would
be very useful to mitigate the effects of the virus and possibly arrest
its spread. Additionally, early detection is important because the
antivirals lose their efficacy if administered 24–48 h after
onset of infection in people with weak or compromised immune systems.4,5 Measuring drug susceptibility would provide primary care physicians
with an added diagnostic tool in support of their clinical decisions.
Monitoring drug susceptibility is especially important since reports
of inhibitors such as M2 ion channel protein, e.g., Amantadine and
Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, e.g., Oseltamivir, resistance has been
reported, the former exhibiting widespread resistance.6−8 Antiviral resistance for the current FDA approved drugs, Zanamivir
and Oseltamivir and the investigational drugs, Premavir and Laninamivir,
is not easy to perform and most certainly not applicable for point
of care diagnosis at this time. Traditional cell culture assays to
test drug susceptibility take a long time and therefore, these assays
are typically performed in a resourceful laboratory setting using
molecular markers that are known to cause NA inhibitor resistance.9 Here, we report the synthesis and ability of
sialic acid analogues to capture influenza virus using three different
strains. We have also developed an assay to monitor NA inhibitor susceptibility
of the virus toward the two major FDA approved NA inhibitors, Zanamivir
and Oseltamivir.

Influenza virus has two major surface glycoproteins,
Hemagglutinin
(HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) that are known to bind to N-acetyl neuraminic
acids (sialic acids) present on glycoproteins and glycolipids of the
host cells.10 HA is involved in the initial
attachment of the virus to the host cells, whereas NA is the enzyme
that cleaves the residual sialic acid from the remaining cells to
facilitate release of the viral progeny. These two influenza glycoproteins
are excellent targets for capturing influenza virus for use in diagnosis,
particularly because there are approximately 300 copies of HA and
50 copies of NA on a single viral particle, respectively.11−13 Although several studies, including our own, have focused on developing
sialic acid based microarrays to capture HA to study transmissibility
of the virus,14−18 we focused on developing molecules that capture NA in this report.
This approach allows us to monitor drug susceptibility since Zanamivir
and Oseltamivir are NA inhibitors.

Experimental section
A Chemical Synthesis and Characterization
The synthesis
and characterization of the compounds used in this
article are given in the Supporting Information.

B Biological Assays
B.1 Immobilization
of Glycans
Synthetic
glycans were covalently immobilized onto Nexterion NHS slides using
a DIGILAB OmniGrid Micro printer in 300 mM phosphate buffer with 0.005%
Tween-20 at pH 8.5. Each glycan was printed 20 times in quintuplicate
at 200 μM concentration. Following printing, the glycans were
allowed to react for 30 min at 60% humidity. After overnight desiccation,
the slides were blocked for 60 min with 50 mM ethanolamine in 50 mM
boric acid buffer (pH 9.5), washed 3 times with deionized (DI) water,
dried and stored at −20 °C.

B.2 Limit
of Detection Assay
To determine
the limit of detection, a serial 10-fold dilution was performed for
A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and A/Aichi/2/1968 strains.
The concentration of A/Brisbane/59/2007 was tested from 2.4 ×
106–2.4 × 101 plaque forming units
(PFU), A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 from 9.0 × 106–9.0
× 101 PFU and A/Aichi/2/1968 from 1.5 × 106–1.5 × 101 PFU. Each concentration
of virus was applied to the microarray for 60 min in a buffer consisting
of PBS, 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20. Postvirus incubation and wash (three
times with PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 and two times with PBS), antibodies
specific to each virus were diluted and added to the microarray for
60 min. For A/Brisbane/59/2007, ferret hyperimmune sera to influenza
A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), NR-19260 was diluted 5000-fold, for A/Solomon
Islands/3/2006 ferret hyperimmune sera to influenza A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
(H1N1), NR-19262 was diluted 1000-fold and for A/Aichi/2/1968 polyclonal
anti-influenza virus A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) antiserum chicken, NR-3125
was diluted 5000-fold. Slides were washed as described above and incubated
for 60 min with the appropriate fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies.
For A/Brisbane/59/2007, antiferret IgG, IgA, IgM (H+L) rhodamine antibody
was diluted 10 000-fold, for A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 antiferret
IgG, IgA, IgM (H+L), rhodamine antibody was diluted 5000-fold and
for A/Aichi/2/1968, Alexa Fluor 633 goat antichicken IgG (H+L) was
diluted 20 000-fold. The slides were washed as described above,
followed by a DI water rinse. The slides were dried and scanned using
the GenePix4000B scanner. A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
were scanned at 532 nm and A/Aichi/2/1968 at 635 nm. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.

B.3 Drug
Susceptibility Assay
To determine
drug susceptibility for A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
and A/Aichi/2/1968, each virus strain, 105 PFU, was premixed
with 10 ng of antiviral Zanamivir or Oseltamivir, for 30 min at rt.
The premixed sample was subsequently added to the microarray and allowed
to incubate for 60 min. Fluorescence intensity was measured as previously
described in the limit of detection methods. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Results and Discussion
The structures of the eight molecules used to develop the focused
microarray are shown in Figure 1. There are
several salient features of the designer molecules. First, all eight
molecules are derived from the natural receptor, namely sialic acid.
Second, the molecules have a free amine at the end of a spacer, which
is necessary for facile attachment to an activated carboxyl acid group
on any surface. Third, the molecules also have an amine or a guanidine
group at the four position; introduction of a polar group at the four
position has been demonstrated to be highly specific to influenza
virus as X-ray structures have shown that the polar group fits very
well into a binding pocket of influenza virus NA, but does not fit
well into human or bacterial NA.19 Fourth,
we designed two types of molecules; SC1–4 are
sialic acid analogues that have spacers attached to the 2 position
via a thiol linkage, in contrast, SC5–SC8 are
analogues derived from Zanamivir and attached to the spacer at the
7 position.20−22 Finally, since we recently demonstrated that molecules
similar to SC1–4 and bivalent molecules thereof,
inhibited two H1N1 and H3N2 strains at low nanomolar concentrations,
we designed monovalent and bivalent derivatives.23 The bivalent derivatives were synthesized for two reasons.
First, the bivalent scaffold provides additional distance from the
microarray surface for the NAs of the virus to bind. Second, NA exists
as a tetramer with four binding sites, the distances between the two
glycan headgroups are spaced such that a single molecule could fit
into to two binding sites from a single NA tetramer or alternatively,
fit into the pockets of two adjacent NA tetramers on a single virion.23 When these mono and bivalent molecules are tethered
to a surface, the overall binding affinity of multiple glycans with
influenza viruses is expected to increase exponentially, leading to
a higher capturing efficiency.

Figure 1 Structures of the tailored glycans. The
blue ellipse represents
the two glycan headgroups, and I and II represent mono and bivalent
derivatives. The natural receptor, N-acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic
acid), and the FDA approved antivirals, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir,
are also depicted.

The syntheses of the
molecules are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. For SC1–4, the thioacetate
group of the known azido compound 1(24) was reacted with a suitable six carbon
spacer, which had a chloride at the terminus to yield 2 in appreciable amounts. The azide was reduced under mild conditions
using triphenylphosphine and the amine group was either protected
by a tert-butoxy group or a suitably protected guanidine group followed
by replacement of the chloride by an azide using sodium azide to yield 3a and 3b in decent yields. Zemplén deprotection
to remove the acetates and methyl ester was followed by acidic removal
of the tert-butoxy groups and subsequent reduction of the azide using
standard hydrogenation conditions yielded the monovalent compounds SC1 and SC2, which had an amine and a guanidine
group at the four position of the sialic acid, respectively. Copper(I)
catalyzed 1,3 dipolar addition of 3a,b with
a dimeric scaffold, 4, bearing two alkyne groups resulted
in the fully protected bivalent compounds, 5a,b, in good yields. The protecting groups were removed using the same
conditions as described for the monovalent derivatives to yield the
bivalent compounds, SC3–4. For the Zanamivir analogues, SC5–8, we attached the spacer to the seven hydroxyl
group as modifications at this position are well tolerated by NA;
indeed, this approach has been used to attach a biotin to Zanamivir.20 To this end, we elaborated the known azido compound 6(20−22) by reducing the azide and protecting the free amine
group using a tert-butoxy group to yield 7 in high yields.
This was followed by base induced deprotection of the acetate groups
and acetonide protection of the 8,9 hydroxyl groups, leaving the hydroxyl
group at the seven position open for conjugation to the spacer. The
terminal amine of a six carbon spacer bearing an azide group at the
opposite end was conjugated to 8 in a two-step procedure
using p-nitrochloroformate as the coupler to yield
the carbamate 9. The acetonide group was removed under
mild acidic conditions to produce 10a. The guanidine
derivative, 10b, was synthesized from 10a, the tert butoxy group was removed and a suitably protected guanidine
group was attached to the free amine to yield 10b in
significant amounts. This strategy of installing the guanidine group
at this later stage was more successful in our hands as opposed to
introducing the guanidine group early in the synthesis, the latter
strategy gave us undesirable products and variable results. Global
deprotection of 10a,b was performed as described
for SC1,2 to yield SC5,6 in good yields. The bivalent derivatives SC7,8 were synthesized from 10a,b in a manner similar to the synthesis of SC3,4 by coupling to the scaffold 4, followed by global deprotection.
The final compounds were purified using size exclusion chromatography
using Biogel P2 and the appropriate fractions containing the compounds
were freeze-dried to produce colorless foamy solid material.

The synthetic glycans were printed onto commercial
glass slides
bearing activated carboxyl groups for conjugation to the free amines
of SC1–8 to produce a focused microarray. Printing
was performed at various concentrations; we used a concentration of
200 μM for all assays in this report as it gave us excellent
signal-to-noise ratio. Amine terminated PEG was printed as a negative
control. Amine terminated biotin was included as a positive control.
The microarray was exposed to three different strains of influenza
virus, two H1N1, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and
a H3N2, A/Aichi/2/1968. The strains were incubated at rt for 60 min,
followed by incubation of the appropriate primary and fluorescently
labeled secondary antibody. The slides were washed at every stage
extensively, and the slides were scanned using a Genepix scanner at
532 or 635 nm. Reproduced in Figure 2A is the
fluorescence image where the microarray was exposed to 105 PFU of H1N1 Influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007. The image clearly
shows that the bivalent compounds, SC3,4,7,8, captured the virus very well; however,
most of the monovalent compounds, SC1,2,5,6, bind weakly to this strain, suggesting that
the bivalent derivatives provide the required distance from the surface
for the virus to bind. We and others have observed this phenomenon
before, binding of glycans to their respective analytes are highly
dependent on glycan density and presentation.14,25 Exposure to H3N2 strain A/Aichi/2/1968 resulted in similar results
(Figure 3C); however, all compounds bound to
H1N1 A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, indicating that this virus strain is
more accommodating in its binding preferences. (Figure 3B). Nonspecific binding to the control ligand, PEG, was negligible,
which is a very important aspect of biosensor development as viruses
are notorious in terms of nonspecific binding. Several other controls
(with buffer only, using other synthetic glycans) were performed and
all of these control experiments resulted in no binding. We observed
a differential response to the ligands for each viral strain, for
example, the A/Aichi/2/1968 strain exhibits similar binding to all
four bivalent compounds, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 strain binds better
to the bivalent compounds, SC4 and SC8,
with the guanidine group at the four position. With more ligands and
slight differences in the binding affinities, this differential pattern
could potentially be used to develop a “fingerprint”
pattern of recognition for each strain, including emerging strains.26

Virus concentration was 105 PFU. Fluorescence intensity
was measured by the Genepix scanner using ferret hyperimmune sera
to influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) and antiferret rhodamine labeled
antibody. A/Brisbane/59/2007 was scanned at 532 nm. The experiment
was performed in triplicate.

Influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007, (B) H1N1 Influenza A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
(C) H3N2 Influenza A/Aichi/2/1968. Fluorescence intensity for A/Brisbane/59/2007
was measured as previously described for Figure 2. Fluorescence intensity was measured by the Genepix scanner using
ferret hyperimmune sera to influenza A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)
and antiferret rhodamine labeled antibody; polyclonal antiserum chicken
to A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) and Alexa Fluor 633 labeled antichicken.
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 was scanned at 532 nm and A/Aichi/2/1968
at 635 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Next, we determined the analytical limit of detection
using different
concentrations of the different strains from 106 to 101 PFU. As shown in Figure 3A–C,
the bivalent compounds bind to the three different strains at higher
concentrations very well with high relative fluorescence intensities.
At the lowest tested concentration of 101 PFU, the bivalent
compounds SC3 and SC7 bind well to the H1N1
A/Brisbane/59/2007 and the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 strains; however, SC3 and SC1 bind to the H3N2 A/Aichi/2/1968 strain.
Known differences in the binding pockets of N1 and N2 could be a possible
reason for this difference in binding at lower concentrations in addition
to the number of NAs present on the surface of each strain.27 We note that these first generation ligands
can capture extremely low clinically relevant concentrations of viruses
and further optimization could lead to lower limits of detection.
Finally, we tested the microarray for susceptibility to FDA approved
antivirals, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir (Figure 4). Briefly, known concentrations of the three strains were premixed
with either one of the antivirals and exposed to the microarray. Washing
to remove unbound virus was followed by detection using the appropriate
primary and labeled secondary antibody. It was gratifying to observe
no binding to any of the compounds for all three strains, which indicates
that the antiviral blocks the NA leading to loss of signal. There
are two outliers, SC3 and SC7. In the presence
of antivirals, SC3 binds H3N2 A/Aichi/2/1968 strain and SC7 binds both H1N1 strains. A possible explanation for these
observations could be that the binding pocket of HA for each particular
strain could accommodate sialic acid with an amine at the 4 position,
which is similar to the structure of the glycan head groups in SC3 and SC7.

Ten nanograms of antivirals Zanamivir or Oseltamivir were premixed
with the strains at 105 PFU for 30 min at rt and subsequently
added to the microarray. Fluorescence intensity was measured as previously
described in Figures 2 and 3. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Conclusions
We have synthesized
tailored glycans, printed them onto glass slides
and demonstrated the ability of a focused microarray to capture three
influenza strains at different concentrations. We determined the limit
of detection to be 101 PFU, which indicates that the assay
is clinically relevant. We also demonstrated that the assay can be
used to test drug susceptibility of current FDA approved antivirals,
Zanamivir and Oseltamivir, by premixing the antivirals with the strains
and performing the assay. Thus, the assay reported in this article
can be performed rapidly within hours using minimal tools. In contrast,
current genotyping methods to determine antiviral resistance is typically
performed in a clinical laboratory using molecular markers by trained
personnel, specialized equipment and days to accomplish. We are currently
expanding our efforts to develop second generation ligands and include
more strains to demonstrate broad applicability. By further optimization
of ligand structure, testing different conditions and biosensor platforms,
this assay has the potential to be translated to rapid diagnostic
tests.
