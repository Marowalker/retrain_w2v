Amorphous
materials exhibit distinct physicochemical properties
compared to their respective crystalline counterparts. One of these
properties, the increased solubility of amorphous materials, is exploited
in the pharmaceutical industry as a way of increasing bioavailability
of poorly water-soluble drugs. Despite the increasing interest in
drug amorphization, the analytical physicochemical toolbox is lacking
a reliable method for direct amorphous solubility assessment. Here,
we show, for the first time, a direct approach to measure the amorphous
solubility of diverse drugs by combining optics with fluidics, the
single particle analysis (SPA) method. Moreover, a comparison was
made to a theoretical estimation based on thermal analysis and to
a standardized supersaturation and precipitation method. We have found
a good level of agreement between the three methods. Importantly,
the SPA method allowed for the first experimental measurement of the
amorphous solubility for griseofulvin, a fast crystallizing drug,
without the use of a crystallization inhibitor. In conclusion, the
SPA approach enables rapid and straightforward determination of the
supersaturation potential for amorphous materials of less than 0.1
mg, which could prove highly beneficial in the fields of materials
science, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, food science, pharmaceutical
science, and others.

==== Body
In materials
science, amorphous
solids lack the three-dimensional long-range order characteristic
for crystalline solids. The two materials, having the same molecular
composition, possess distinctly different physicochemical properties.
The properties of amorphous materials are successfully exploited in
many fields, ranging from the electronics, nuclear, chemical, and
pharmaceutical industries.1−6 The pharmaceutical industry is exploiting one specific property
of amorphous materials, their increased solubility compared to the
respective crystalline materials (often referred to as “apparent
solubility”), to enhance the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble
drugs.7,8 However, the available physicochemical analytical
toolbox lacks a method that would enable direct measurement of amorphous
solubility, the maximum drug concentration in solution upon dissolution
of amorphous solid. Here, we use a novel technique, combining the
fields of optics and fluidics, to measure amorphous solubility.

Upon dissolution of an amorphous material, a supersaturated solution
with a higher chemical potential (μsup) compared
to a solution at thermodynamic equilibrium (μeq)
is generated (eq 1).9−12 The difference in chemical potential (Δμ) is defined
as shown in eq 2, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature,
and asup and aeq are the activity of the solute in a supersaturated state and at
the thermodynamic equilibrium, respectively.13 For sufficiently dilute solutions, the activities of the solute
in the supersaturated and equilibrium states can be replaced by the
respective concentrations of the solute. Therefore, eq 2 can be written as eq 3, where Csup is the drug concentration in solution at the point of supersaturation,
and Ceq is the drug concentration in solution
at the thermodynamic equilibrium; the ratio between these two concentrations
is the degree of supersaturation (DS). 1   2   3  

Before the maximum DS in solution
is reached, crystallization of
solute molecules can occur. This phenomenon has resulted in difficulties
in experimentally determining the maximum DS of amorphous solids when
using classical dissolution experiments, as observed by Murdande et
al.10,14

The maximum DS can alternatively be
estimated from data acquired
by thermal analysis of the crystalline and respective amorphous samples.
An initial method was developed by Hoffman et al.,15 and this was later improved by Murdande et al.10 by taking into account the effects of moisture
sorption and ionization. As might be expected, the theoretically estimated
amorphous solubilities have been higher than the experimentally achieved
values.9,14,16 Therefore,
the accurate experimental measurement of amorphous solubility, especially
for fast crystallizing drugs, has gained the general status of “unattainable”.17

Nevertheless, Almeida et al. reported
the first experimental measurement
of amorphous solubility of griseofulvin (GRI), a fast crystallizing
drug.18 They assessed amorphous solubility
by investigating phase separation phenomena upon precipitation using
fluorescent probes. However, a crystallization inhibitor to prevent
GRI from crystallizing during the experiment had to be used. Another
approach to study drug supersaturation, the standardized supersaturation
and precipitation method (SSPM), in which drug predissolved in organic
solvent is added to aqueous buffer and the onset of precipitation
is detected, was developed by Palmelund et al.19 The method has been developed for a standardized comparison
of supersaturation duration and DS between different compounds under
certain conditions, e.g., in biorelevant media or in the presence
of precipitation inhibitors, rather than for the exact measurement
of the drug’s amorphous solubility.

Until now, the direct
experimental measurement of amorphous solubility
has not been accomplished. The hypothesis that this still is possible
is based on the fusion of fluidics and optics, resulting in development
of the novel image-based single particle analysis (SPA) method.20 The method is able to measure the equilibrium
solubility of crystalline compounds requiring only a very low amount
of material (<0.1 mg) with the measurement starting as soon as
the material comes in contact with the solvent.20,21 During the measurement, particles of interest are entrapped in the
flow-through compartment of a specifically designed cell that enables
simultaneous extraction of the solvent, maintaining sink conditions,
and imaging of the dissolving particles. The obtained images are then
further processed with an in-house developed algorithm, and solubility
values are generated.

Here, using the SPA method, we show the
first direct measurements
of amorphous solubility of a diverse range of drugs. Moreover, we
compare the results obtained with the SPA method to the theoretically
estimated values obtained via thermal analysis, as well as the values
estimated with the SSPM method. In this way, we show the suitability
of the SPA method for direct measurement of amorphous solubility.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Celecoxib (CEL) was acquired from AK Scientific,
Inc. (Union City, CA, USA). Danazol (DAN) was acquired from BASF (Ludwigshafen,
Germany). Dipyridamole (DIP), GRI, and indomethacin (IND) were acquired
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). These compounds were selected
to represent the acidic, basic, and neutral nature of drug compounds.
Moreover, the selected compounds can be made amorphous without significant
degradation by melting and cooling. GRI was also selected due to its
fast crystallization kinetics from the amorphous form.14,18

Preparation of Amorphous Forms
The received crystalline
forms of the compounds were heated in an aluminum sample holder on
a hot plate to slightly above their respective melting points until
complete melting was observed. The melt was then immersed in liquid
nitrogen and placed in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. After
the nitrogen had evaporated, the sample was equilibrated to room temperature
and gently ground with a mortar and pestle before being further analyzed.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC experiments
were performed using a DSC823e (Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland)
equipped with a refrigerated cooling system (Julabo FT 900, Seelbach,
Germany). Nitrogen was used as a purge gas (50 mL/min).

Samples
of 5–10 mg were tightly packed into standard aluminum crucibles
(40 μL) with pierced lids. The samples were equilibrated at
25 °C for 3 min and then linearly heated with a heating rate
of 10 °C/min to 20 °C above their respective melting points.
Measurements of both amorphous and crystalline samples were recorded
in triplicate, and thermal events were analyzed using the STARe software
(Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). Temperatures and melting
enthalpies were used to estimate the free energy difference between
the amorphous and crystalline forms.

X-ray Powder Diffraction
(XRPD)
XRPD diffractograms
were recorded using an Aerius diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical
B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.540598 Å) and a divergence slit of 0.5°. Samples were
packed into aluminum sample holders and measured with a step size
of 0.0066° at 40 kV and 7.5 mA from 5° to 35° (2θ).
Measurements were performed in triplicates with independent samples.

Dynamic Water Sorption (DVS)
The water sorption isotherms
of the five amorphous drug samples were determined using the method
previously described by Murdande et al.10 A VTI-SA+ Vapor Sorption Analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE,
USA) was used to measure the moisture sorption profiles of the amorphous
samples. Approximately 10 mg of amorphous sample was placed into a
glass holder. To reduce the possibility of sample crystallization
during the measurement, no drying step was used. The DVS measurements
were performed at 25 °C from 0 to 95% relative humidity (in 10%
steps up to 90%). The equilibrium criterion was 0.001% weight change
in 5 min with a maximum step time of 150 min. The instrument is calibrated
once a month.

Dissolution Media
HCl and borate
buffers (pH 2.0 and
pH 9.0, respectively) were prepared according to the United States
Pharmacopeia (Solutions/Buffer Solutions). Milli-Q water was obtained
with the Milli-Q Integral 15 system (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA,
USA).

Equilibrium Solubility
The equilibirum solubilities
of the five model compounds were measured employing a shake-flask
method, using a μDISS Profiler (Pion Inc., Billerica, MA, USA)
at 22 °C. For CEL, DAN, GRI, and IND, an excess amount of crystalline
compound was added to 10 mL of USP pH 2.0 buffer. For DIP, an excess
amount of crystalline compound was added to 10 mL of USP pH 9.0 buffer.
The excess amount for all compounds was 2.2 ± 0.2 mg and the
buffer’s pH was selected such that the intrinsic solubility,
i.e., the solubility of the un-ionized form, was measured. The concentrations
of all compounds were measured, at least in triplicate, until a plateau
in the dissolution curve was reached. Each probe of the μDISS
device was individually calibrated for each compound. The area under
the curve of the second derivative of absorbance was used for calibration
in order to avoid interference of the excess drug. Experimental settings
are listed in Table S1.

Supersaturation
Study Using SSPM
Determination of the
initial dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration (C100%) for the supersaturation
studies was done as described by Palmelund et al.19 First, the C100% stock solution of each compound was determined
such that addition of 200 μL of the compound in the DMSO solution
to the buffer would result in precipitation within 1–5 min.
Consecutively, stock solutions that resulted in C87.5%, C75.0%, and
C50.0% upon addition of 200 μL of predissolved drug in DMSO
to 10 mL of the buffer were prepared. Additionally, stock solutions
corresponding to C30.0% for CEL and, C60.0% for DIP and GRI were prepared.
The total volume of DMSO added was kept at 2% for all experiments.
Upon spiking the buffer with the stock solution, the concentration
was monitored in situ with the μDISS Profiler (Pion Inc., Billerica,
MA, USA) by using the area under the curve of the second derivative
of the UV absorbance for 60 min or longer, if no precipitation had
occurred.

The determination of induction time of precipitation
(tind) is limited by the experimental
conditions.19 Here, a slightly different
approach to that originally proposed by Palmelund et al. to determine tind was developed.19 The time-point of the sharpest decrease in concentration was determined
as the local minimum of the first derivative of the concentration
versus time plot using Matlab software (MathWorks, Natick, MA, US)
(Figure S1). The crystallization rate was
subsequently calculated using the slope of the linear trend-line fitted
to 12 data points around the point of the steepest decrease in concentration.
Consequently, the tind was defined as
the point where the fitted trend-line crossed the initial concentration
value.

Image-Based SPA Solubility Measurements
Dissolution
experiments were conducted using the SPA method as described previously
by Svanbäck et al. and Štukelj et al.21,22 Briefly, the method consists of an image-analysis algorithm and
a flow-through setup, which enables imaging of the fixed drug particles
under constant flow conditions (Figure S2). The constant flow continuously displaces drug molecules from the
surface of the dissolving particle. This enables, via the analysis
of the image series, for the concentration of the solute to be measured
at the particle-solution interface (for a more detailed description,
see Supporting Information S-2). According
to the Noyes and Whitney diffusion layer theory, the measured concentration
is the thermodynamic equilibrium solubility of a crystalline compound.22−24 Consequently, with the amorphous material, the concentration at
the interface is equal to the maximum achievable drug concentration
in solution–amorphous solubility. (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Crystalline and amorphous particle depicted
at the beginning and
after 10 min of the SPA measurement. As the dissolution occurs in
the controlled environment with sink conditions, the only rate limiting
step is the concentration at the particle–solution interface.
With the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form, the concentration
at the interface is equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration.
Consequently, with the amorphous material, the concentration at the
interface is equal to the maximum achievable drug supersaturation
in solution upon amorphization.

The solubilities of all five crystalline and amorphous samples
were measured in triplicate in Milli-Q water. Moreover, the solubilities
of CEL, DAN, GRI, and IND were measured in USP buffer pH 2.0, and
the solubility of DIP was measured in USP buffer pH 9.0. The obtained
solubility values, therefore, were the average of three independent
measurements, where at least ten particles per single measurement
were analyzed. Additionally, amorphous IND was also measured in HCl
buffer pH 2.0 in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP).
The additional measurement using PVP was performed in order to assess
the need for a crystallization inhibitor in the SPA experiments.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Solid-State Forms
The results of
the solid-state characterization of the five model compounds, in both
crystalline and amorphous form, are presented in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 1. The results are
in good agreement with previously reported XRPD and DSC data on these
compounds.14,16,25 Furthermore, the XRPD diffractograms of the crystalline forms of
DAN, DIP, GRI, and IND match the predicted diffractograms for the
corresponding structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD),
YAPZEU, BIRKES10, GRISFL, and INDMET01, respectively. For crystalline
CEL, the CSD-predicted XRPD powder pattern (DIBBUL) exhibits substantially
different relative peak intensities compared to our experimental data,
presumably due to preferred orientation effects of the needle shaped
particles.26 Nonetheless, the diffraction
pattern of CEL in this study has three sharp diffraction peaks that
indicate the thermodynamically stable crystalline form of CEL.27,28 Amorphous samples were devoid of diffraction peaks, and all showed
a glass transition, followed by crystallization and melting (Figure 2 and Table 1).

Validation of the SPA Method
The equilibrium solubilities
of the crystalline compounds were measured with the shake-flask method
and compared to the equilibrium solubilities measured with the SPA
method (Figure 3a).
There was no significant difference in the standard deviation for
the SPA (M = 0.51 μg/mL, SD = 0.35 μg/mL)
and the shake-flask method (M = 0.27 μg/mL,
SD = 0.12 μg/mL) conditions; t(4) = 1.72, p = 0.16. A correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.996 was observed, validating the SPA method for measuring
the thermodynamic equilibrium solubility of the selected crystalline
model compounds. Moreover, the solubility of amorphous IND was measured
in both USP HCl buffer pH 2.0 and the same buffer with PVP (0.1% (w/v))
added (Figure 3b).
PVP acts as a crystallization inhibitor during the dissolution of
amorphous material.29 The presence of PVP
in the dissolution medium did not affect the solubility of amorphous
IND measured with the SPA method. The result suggests that the SPA
method is able to directly measure the amorphous solubility of a drug,
without the need for crystallization inhibitors.

To rationalize the solubility
values for amorphous forms obtained
with the SPA method, the amorphous solubilities of the five model
drugs were approached in three different ways, (1) theoretical estimation
using the Hoffman method corrected for the impact of absorbed water
on amorphous solute, (2) indirect measurement using the modified SSPM,
and (3) direct measurement with the SPA method. Moreover, a comparison
was made also to other attempts of measuring amorphous solubility
reported in literature.10,16,18,31 To facilitate comparison of amorphous
solubility between the selected model compounds, the DS with respect
to thermodynamic equilibrium solubility was used.

Theoretical
Estimation of DS
According to Hoffman,
the difference in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) between
the crystalline and the amorphous form can be estimated using eq 4.15Hm, Tm,
and T are the melting enthalpy of the crystalline
form, the melting temperature of the crystalline form, and the experimental
temperature measured in Kelvin, respectively. Using the ΔG estimation, the maximum DS due to amorphization was predicted
according to Hancock and Parks9 and corrected
for the impact of water on the amorphous solute as proposed by Murdande
et al. through eq 5.10R and exp(−I(a2)) are the gas constant and a correction
factor obtained from DVS measurements, as shown by Murdande et al.10 The calculated values are listed in Table 2. 4   5

Indirect Measurement of
DS Using the Modified SSPM
The modified SSPM measurement
is considered indirect, since the maximum
DS was not directly measured but rather extrapolated. The tind of each model compound at a certain DS was
estimated from the dissolution profile, as described in the Materials and Methods section. DS values for the
respective stock solutions of each compound were calculated and plotted
against tind (Figure S3). The fitted curves follow eq 6, derived from classical nucleation theory assuming tind is inversely proportional to the nucleation
rate, with α and β being the two linear coefficients.19,31,32 In order to estimate the maximum
DS, a linear trend line was fitted only to the points that would fall
within the horizontal region of the fit according to eq 6 (Figure S4). Otherwise, an estimation of the maximum DS would not be possible,
since the nucleation theory results in infinite DS with infinitesimal tind. The estimated maximum DS values are listed
in Table 2. 6  

Direct Measurement of DS
Using the SPA Method
The solubilities
of the amorphous and crystalline samples were measured in Milli-Q
water and USP buffers as soon as the solvent came in contact with
particles. The DS upon amorphization was calculated using eq 3. The calculated DS values
for each of the model compounds are summarized in Table 2.

Effect of Ionization
The solubility ratio between two
polymorphs of the same compound is independent of the solvent used.33 On the other hand, Murdande et al. proposed
an effect of ionization on the DS with respect to amorphous vs crystalline
materials.10 In this study, the USP buffers
were used in a way that any possible ionization effect was avoided,
and drugs were in their respective un-ionized forms. Furthermore,
close agreement between the DS values observed in Milli-Q water and
USP buffers with the SPA method was observed (Table 2). No ionization effect on DS was detected
with the SPA method; the difference between the DS in Milli-Q and
DS in USP buffers is the same for ionizable drugs (CEL, DIP, and IND)
as for the neutral drugs (DAN and GRI).

Onset of Crystallization
The literature values for
DS upon amorphization obtained with classical dissolution of amorphous
material and measurement of concentration overtime are lower than
the DS values measured by the SPA method, the modified SSPM, as well
as the theoretical estimation (Table 2). The reason for this is that, in classical dissolution
measurements, crystallization may start before the maximum DS in solution
is reached.9,10,16 With the modified SSPM, the issue of instantaneous precipitation,
when the solution is close to the maximum DS, was avoided by measuring
the precipitation onset of solutions with DS below the maximum DS.
In contrast to classical dissolution experiments, measurements with
the SPA method were conducted as soon as the solvent came in contact
with the sample in order to circumvent any possible solid-state transformations
during the measurements.

Successful Measurement of DS with the SPA
Method
For
three compounds, CEL, DAN, and IND, the DS values obtained with the
SPA method (22.3, 21.9, and 22.6, respectively), the adapted SSPM
method (20.6, 21.5, and 22.3, respectively), and the theoretical estimation
(21.7, 23.9, and 18.7, respectively) show high correlation (Table 2). For CEL, the DS
range, 7–21, reported in the literature was obtained over a
temperature range of 34–75 °C.18 The relevant temperature range for comparison with this study is
below the Tg of the drug, with the predicted
DS value of 21 listed in Table 2. In contrast, for DIP, the DS values obtained with the SPA
(17.2) and adapted SSPM (17.3) methods are in close agreement, but
the theoretically estimated value is significantly lower (6.6).

A possible reason for the inconsistency in DS values for DIP could
be the fact that the Hoffman method assumes that the heat capacities
(Cp) of the crystalline and amorphous
material are the same. The assumption might lead to inaccurate ΔG estimation, especially for compounds with a significant
difference in Cp between the crystalline
and amorphous forms. An approach that is free of such Cp assumptions was developed by Almeida et al.18 Nevertheless, despite the assumption of uniform Cp for crystalline and amorphous forms, the Hoffman
method has been found to provide a good estimate of the ΔG.34 Moreover, for another drug
used in this study (GRI), the Hoffman method and the approach by Almeida
et al. gave similar values of DS upon amorphization (34.6 and 30.9,
respectively).

Another reason for the discrepancy between the
theoretically estimated
and the experimentally measured DS of DIP could be the hygroscopicity
of the sample. DIP is highly hygroscopic, which can be observed as
evaporation of adsorbed water from the surface of crystalline material
leading to the highlighted endothermic event slightly above 100 °C
in the DSC plot (Figure 2). Furthermore, the DVS experiment also showed the high affinity
of amorphous DIP for water, which resulted in sample mass loss (0.39%)
above RH 80%; upon crystallization, water was expelled from the sample
resulting in weight loss (Figure S5). The
results suggest that the correction for the impact of water on the
highly hygroscopic amorphous sample might overcorrect the DS. To follow
up on this assumption, the estimated DS based solely on the ΔG, without the correction for the adsorbed water, was calculated.
A value of 15.2 was obtained, which is much closer to the experimentally
measured DS with the SPA method and the one estimated with the adapted
SSPM method.

Amorphous Solubility of the Rapidly Crystallizing
GRI
Using the SPA method, without any crystallization inhibitor
present
in the medium, a DS of 34.3 for GRI was obtained. The DS value was
in good agreement with the value estimated according to the Hoffman
method (34.6). In contrast, the DS estimated with the modified SSPM
was much lower at 5.9. GRI is known for its fast crystallization kinetics,
which is most likely the reason for the low maximum DS observed by
the adapted SSPM method. This might be prevented with the addition
of a crystallization inhibitor, as was done with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
acetate succinate grade HF (HPMCAS-HF) by Almeida et al.18 They attempted to indirectly measure amorphous
solubility by looking at the phase separation phenomena upon precipitation
using fluorescent probes as they added drugs dissolved in organic
solvent to the aqueous buffers. When using crystallization inhibitors,
it is important to evaluate if the obtained higher DS is actually
due to inhibition of crystallization and not due to a solubility enhancing
effect of these compounds. Nonetheless, the DS for GRI, obtained by
Almeida et al. (30.8) is close to that measured with the SPA method
(34.3).

Conclusion
In this study, we have
demonstrated the suitability of the SPA
method for direct measurement of solubility of amorphous materials.
The amorphous solubilities of five model drug compounds were assessed
using three different approaches, the theoretical estimation using
the Hoffman method, indirect measurement using the modified SSPM method,
and direct measurement using the SPA method. For CEL, DAN, and IND,
the amorphous solubility values correlated for all three methods used.
For DIP, the theoretically estimated DS was, most likely due to the
hygroscopic nature of the sample, and significantly lower when compared
to the values obtained with the adapted SSPM and the SPA method, which
were in agreement with one another. On the other hand, for GRI, the
SPA method was in agreement with the Hoffman method but not the adapted
SSPM method due to fast crystallization kinetics of the drug.

The SPA method used in this study represents a new approach for
direct experimental measurement of amorphous solubility. The SPA method
is especially useful when the material of interest crystallizes quickly
upon dissolution, which can mask its true supersaturation potential
with established solubility measurement methods. GRI, a fast crystallizing
drug, was successfully analyzed in this work, and for the first time,
its amorphous solubility was experimentally determined without the
use of crystallization inhibitors.

The straightforward approach
to measure amorphous solubility using
the SPA method provides insights in the supersaturation potential
that a certain drug candidate (or indeed any other material) possesses.
This, now easily extracted, piece of information is of high value
in the drug formulation process and could result in more optimized
drug products. Moreover, the method has much potential in the fields
of materials science, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, food
science, and other fields where amorphization, solubility, and supersaturation
play a significant role.
