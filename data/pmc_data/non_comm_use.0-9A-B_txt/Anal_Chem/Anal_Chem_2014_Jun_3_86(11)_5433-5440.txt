Quantitative NMR-based metabolite
profiling is challenged by the
deleterious effects of abundant proteins in the intact blood plasma/serum,
which underscores the need for alternative approaches. Protein removal
by ultrafiltration using low molecular weight cutoff filters thus
represents an important step. However, protein precipitation, an alternative
and simple approach for protein removal, lacks detailed quantitative
assessment for use in NMR based metabolomics. In this study, we have
comprehensively evaluated the performance of protein precipitation
using methanol, acetonitrile, perchloric acid, and trichloroacetic
acid and ultrafiltration approaches using 1D and 2D NMR, based on
the identification and absolute quantitation of 44 human blood metabolites,
including a few identified for the first time in the NMR spectra of
human serum. We also investigated the use of a “smart isotope
tag,” 15N-cholamine for further resolution enhancement,
which resulted in the detection of a number of additional metabolites. 1H NMR of both protein precipitated and ultrafiltered serum
detected all 44 metabolites with comparable reproducibility (average
CV, 3.7% for precipitation; 3.6% for filtration). However, nearly
half of the quantified metabolites in ultrafiltered serum exhibited
10–74% lower concentrations; specifically, tryptophan, benzoate,
and 2-oxoisocaproate showed much lower concentrations compared to
protein precipitated serum. These results indicate that protein precipitation
using methanol offers a reliable approach for routine NMR-based metabolomics
of human blood serum/plasma and should be considered as an alternative
to ultrafiltration. Importantly, protein precipitation, which is commonly
used by mass spectrometry (MS), promises avenues for direct comparison
and correlation of metabolite data obtained from the two analytical
platforms to exploit their combined strength in the metabolomics of
blood.

==== Body
Metabolomics
has experienced
tremendous growth over the past decade, with currently more than 1500
papers published annually that range from methods development to applications
in many areas. The promise of improving early disease diagnosis and
understanding the molecular basis of diseases, the effects of drugs,
toxins, and environments and etc. have provided a strong driving force
in the field.1−6 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
(MS) are the two most widely used analytical platforms for metabolic
profiling of biological specimens including blood, urine, bile, cerebrospinal
fluid, and biopsied or surgical tissue, as well as cells. Specifically,
owing to its potential clinical utility combined with the minimal
invasiveness for diagnosing and managing human diseases, the study
of blood serum/plasma has been a focus of many studies in metabolomics.

However, two major challenges faced in many metabolomics studies
are first, the data for the same or similar samples are often not
directly comparable between NMR and MS. The inability to compare and
correlate data from the two commonly used analytical platforms is
a major bottleneck for biomarker discovery as well as for exploiting
the combined strength of the two analytical platforms for objectives
such as unknown metabolite identification. A major difference in NMR
and MS-based metabolic profiling of serum/plasma stems from the general
approach used for each platform to alleviate the interference of copious
proteins (60–80 g/L) invariably present in blood.7 Prior to analysis by MS, proteins are generally
removed by precipitation using an organic solvent such as methanol,
acetonitrile, or a mixture of solvents.7−14 However, for NMR analysis, protein interference is often alleviated
by suppressing their signals based on their short T2 relaxation
times using the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG)
experiment.15 The limitation of this approach
is that many metabolites that bind to serum/plasma proteins make them
either invisible or significantly attenuated in the resulting NMR
spectra. The attenuation of a number of metabolites such as lactate,
histidine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine has thus been described earlier
using NMR of intact blood serum/plasma.16−18 Second, there is an
increased interest and need for more reliable methodologies and, in
particular, absolute quantitation based approaches. To avoid the deleterious
effects of the attenuation of metabolite concentrations, the vast
majority of the NMR studies of intact blood serum/plasma have been
based on comparison of the relative peak intensities between different
groups of samples. Toward this goal, the removal of proteins from
serum/plasma by ultrafiltration using low molecular weight cutoff
filters represents an important step, which greatly alleviates the
peak attenuation problem and offers an avenue for absolute metabolite
quantitation.19−21 An alternative and a more simple approach, protein
precipitation, which is widely used in MS, has also been explored
and compared qualitatively with ultrafiltration.22,23 However, a comprehensive evaluation of protein precipitation and
ultrafiltration approaches with regard to the absolute quantitation
of metabolites using NMR is currently lacking.

In this study,
we have comprehensively evaluated the performance
of protein precipitation and ultrafiltration approaches using 1D and
2D NMR, based on exhaustive identification and absolute quantitation
of human blood metabolites. The results indicate that while the numbers
of metabolite detected by both protein precipitation and ultrafiltration
are similar, the latter method exhibits a significant attenuation
for nearly half of the quantified metabolites. We also evaluated the
two methods using a “smart isotope tag,” 15N-cholamine.24 The obtained results, combined
with the fact that MS extensively uses protein precipitation, suggest
that protein precipitation for NMR-based metabolomics may provide
good quantitative capabilities as well as avenues for effective comparison
and correlation of data derived from the two complementary analytical
methods.

Ultrafiltration
The centrifugal filters were washed
with water and centrifuged thrice with 300 mL of water at 11 000
rpm for 20 min each time. Six 300 μL serum samples were transferred
to filter tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 11 000 rpm. Filtrate
from two samples were measured and mixed separately with a 100 μL
solution of phosphate buffer (100 mM) in D2O containing
66.17 μM TSP. The solutions were then made up to 550 μL
with the phosphate buffer in D2O and transferred to 5 mm
NMR tubes. Filtrate from four samples were dried, two of these used
for 1H 1D NMR and the other two for detecting carboxyl
containing metabolites after smart isotope tagging with 15N-cholamine, as described below and in ref (24). In addition, two blank
samples were prepared via ultrafiltration in an identical manner to
the nondried serum samples.

Protein Precipitation Using
Methanol
Four 300 μL
serum samples were mixed with methanol in a 1:2 ratio (v/v), vortexed,
and incubated at −20 °C for 20 min. The mixtures were
centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 30 min to pellet proteins. Supernatants
were decanted to fresh vials and dried. Two were used for 1H 1D NMR and the other two samples were used for detecting carboxyl
class of metabolites after tagging with 15N-cholamine.24 In addition, two serum samples were processed
with methanol precipitation as described above, the metabolite extraction
was repeated three times using a methanol and water mixture (2:1),
pooled the supernatants, and then dried.

Protein Precipitation Using
Acetonitrile
Two 300 μL
serum samples were mixed with acetonitrile in a 1:2 ratio (v/v), vortexed,
and incubated at −20 °C for 20 min. The mixtures were
centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 30 min to pellet proteins. Supernatants
were decanted to fresh vials and dried.

Protein Precipitation Using
Perchloric Acid
Two 300
μL serum samples were cooled in an ice bath and mixed with perchloric
acid (30 μL; 4 M),22 vortexed, and
kept aside for 10 min, then centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 30
min to pellet proteins. Supernatants were decanted to fresh vials
and dried. The residue was washed thrice using 500 μL of deionized
water each time and dried.25

Protein Precipitation
Using Trichloroacetic Acid
Two
300 μL serum samples were cooled in an ice bath and mixed with
ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10 μL; 10%), vortexed, and kept
aside for 10 min, then centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 30 min
to pellet proteins. Supernatants were decanted to fresh vials and
dried. The residue was washed thrice using 500 μL of deionized
water each time and dried.25

The
dried samples from each protein removal method were mixed with 100
μL solution of phosphate buffer (100 mM) in D2O containing
66.17 μM TSP, made up to 550 μL with phosphate buffer
in D2O and transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes.

Solutions
of Intact Serum
Two 300 μL serum samples
were made up to 550 μL with phosphate buffer in D2O and transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes for direct analysis.

Metabolite
Tagging with the “Smart Isotope Tag” 15N-Cholamine
Carboxyl group containing metabolites
in both the ultrafiltered and protein precipitated serum samples were
tagged with 15N-cholamine. 15N-Cholamine was
synthesized using a two-step reaction following the protocol described
in the Supporting Information and in greater
detail in a recent publication from our laboratory.24 Briefly, 15N-cholamine (3 mg, 30 μmol)
was added to 250 μL of sample in an Eppendorf tube and the pH
adjusted to 7.0 with 1 M HCl or NaOH. DMTMM (15 mg) was then added
to initiate the reaction.26 The mixtures
were stirred at room temperature for 4 h to complete the reaction.
To maintain amide protonation, the pH was adjusted to 5.0 by adding
1 N HCl or 1 N NaOH, a 10 μL D2O solution containing
0.2 mM TSP was added and the resulting solutions were transferred
to a 3 mm tube for NMR detection of the isotope labeled metabolites.

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed
at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with
a cryoprobe and Z-gradients suitable for inverse detection. The one-pulse
sequence or nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and CPMG
(Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill) pulse sequences with
water suppression using presaturation were used for 1H
1D NMR experiments. The quantitative comparison between samples was
made using CPMG. Homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) experiments such
as 1H–1H double quantum filtered correlation
spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) and 1H–1H total
correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments were performed for both
ultrafiltered and protein precipitated serum samples using methanol
to aid in peak assignment. The 2D experiments were performed with
suppression of residual water signal by presaturation during the relaxation
delay. For DQF-COSY and TOCSY, sweep widths of 9600 Hz were used in
both dimensions; 512 or 400 free induction decays (FIDs) were obtained
with t1 increments for DQF-COSY or TOCSY, respectively,
each with 2048 complex data points. The number of transients used
was 16 and the relaxation delays were 2.0 s for DQF-COSY and 1.5 s
for TOCSY. Sensitivity-enhanced 1H–15N 2D HSQC experiments for isotope labeled samples employed an INEPT
transfer delay of 6 ms corresponding to the 1JNH coupling of 90 Hz. Spectral widths for the 1H and 15N dimensions were approximately 8 kHz and 3 kHz,
respectively. A total of 128 FIDs of 1 024 data points each
were collected in the indirect dimension with 16 or 128 transients
per increment. Nitrogen decoupling during the direct acquisition dimension
was achieved with the Globally Optimized Alternating-Phase Rectangular
Pulses (GARP) sequence. The resulting 2D data were zero-filled to
2 048 in the t2 and 1 024 points in the t1 dimension after forward linear prediction to 256 or 512 points.
For all 2D spectra, a 45° or 90° shifted squared sine-bell
window function was applied to both dimensions before Fourier transformation.
Chemical shifts were referenced to the TSP signal for 1H 1D or 2D spectra or the derivatized formic acid signal (1H, 8.05 ppm; 15N, 123.93 ppm) in HSQC spectra for isotope
labeled samples. Bruker Topspin versions 3.0 or 3.1 software packages
were used for NMR data acquisition, processing, and analyses.

Peak Assignment
and Metabolite Quantitation
Chenomx
NMR Suite Professional Software package (version 5.1; Chenomx Inc.,
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) was used for quantitation of metabolites
using CPMG 1D NMR spectra. The software allows fitting spectral lines
using the standard metabolite library for 800 MHz 1H NMR
spectra. Since the Chenomx software often provides multiple library
hits for many metabolite peaks, the correct and exhaustive peak assignments
were made based on the combination of expected number of peaks, multiplet
patterns, assignments of 2D DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra, and spiking
with authentic standard compounds. Peak fitting with reference to
the internal TSP signal enabled determination of absolute concentrations
for all identified metabolites.

Results and Discussion
1H NMR spectra of both ultrafiltered and protein precipitated
serum provided well resolved peaks and allowed the detection of significantly
higher numbers of metabolites compared to the spectra of intact serum.
A total of 44 metabolites were identified in the 1D spectra of both
ultrafiltered and protein precipitated serum. Figure 1 shows a typical 1H CPMG spectrum of protein precipitated
serum along with annotations for the 44 identified metabolites in
the expanded regions. Qualitatively, identical spectra were obtained
for ultrafiltered as well as protein precipitated serum using methanol,
both obtained under identical conditions, after drying the solvent
and reconstituting in D2O buffer. Both approaches detected
all 44 metabolites with comparable reproducibility (average CV, 3.7%
for precipitation; 3.6% for filtration). Quantitatively, however,
many metabolite peaks were significantly attenuated in intensity in
the ultrafiltered serum compared to protein precipitated serum (see
Figures 2 and 3, for
example). Chenomx software, which is known to provide excellent concentration
accuracies, was used to obtain absolute metabolite concentrations
and the results are shown in Table 2. Spiking
experiments using authentic compounds were used to confirm the identity
of peaks wherever there was overlap such as for arginine and serine
(see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). As seen in Table 2, nearly half of the
quantified metabolites exhibited lower concentrations in ultrafiltered
serum by 10 to 74%, with metabolites such as tryptophan, benzoate,
and 2-oxoisocaproate showing nearly 3- to 4-fold lower concentrations
compared to protein precipitated serum. Two metabolites, citrate and
glycerol, showed significantly higher concentrations and lactate had
marginally higher concentration in ultrafiltered serum (Table 2). Investigations of blank samples for ultrafiltration
revealed that the filter membrane contributed to glycerol and lactate
apart from methanol and an unidentified peak as predominant contaminants
(see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The undesirable contribution of glycerol associated with the membrane
in the centrifugal filters has been reported earlier.21

of the metabolite signals in the displayed region are missing or significantly
attenuated in the T2 filtered spectrum and many including
tryptophan, benzoate, and formate were significantly attenuated in
ultrafiltered serum compared to the protein precipitated serum.

marked with asterisks are attenuated significantly in part a compared
to part b. Of these, the identity for one metabolite (2-oxoisocaproate)
was established in this study and the others are unidentified.

Considering the fact that isotope
enhanced NMR enables access to
additional low concentration metabolites,24,26 carboxyl group containing metabolites in both protein precipitated
and ultrafiltered serum were tagged using the 15N-cholamine
smart tag,24 and the 1H–15N 2D HSQC spectra were evaluated. Figures 4 and 5 show typical spectra showing
2D NMR peaks for 15N-labeled carboxyl group containing
metabolites in the protein precipitated and ultrafiltered serum, respectively.
For easy visualization, the vertical scales for the 2D spectra in
Figures 4 and 5 are
matched based on metabolite peaks, whose concentrations were comparable
in protein precipitated and ultrafiltered serum as shown in Table 2. Clearly, in accordance with the results for 1D
NMR spectra, 15 additional peaks were observed in protein precipitated
serum as indicated by square boxes (Figure 4). However, only one additional peak was observed in the ultrafiltered
serum (indicated by square box in Figure 5).
These additional peaks were either completely missing or too weak
in intensity in one of the spectra. Except for tryptophan (peak no.
46 in Figure 4), the identity for all other
additional peaks is yet to be ascertained. Toward this end, over 25
carboxyl metabolites have so far been identified after the development
of the 15N-cholamine tag, many of which are labeled in
Figures 4 and 5. The
chemical shift library for smart tagged standards is currently being
enhanced to increase the pool of identified metabolites in the blood.

Investigation of protein precipitation using other solvents
indicated
that methanol was the best choice. Precipitation using acetonitrile
retains residual macromolecular signals which interfere in metabolite
quantitation using the 1D ZGPR or NOESY pulse sequence (see Figure
S3 in the Supporting Information), apart
from attenuating many metabolites such as lactate, lysine, asparagine,
and aspartate by 18–21% compared to precipitation using methanol.
Protein precipitation using PCA and TCA deleteriously affected the
integrity of serum metabolite profile/spectra and are therefore unsuitable
for serum metabolite profiling (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), as similarly observed in earlier
studies using NMR spectroscopy22 or mass
spectrometry.27 Thus, the small residual
macromolecules (∼2%) that remain after protein precipitation
using methanol, in this study, necessitated the use of CPMG sequence
to suppress the macromolecular signals for metabolite quantitation
(see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). We have demonstrated that use of the CPMG experiment, while provides
a neat baseline compared to one pulse or 1D NOESY, only marginally
affects the quantitative accuracy. As described previously28,29 and also depicted in Figure S5 in the Supporting
Information, qualitatively, virtually identical spectra are
obtained for CPMG and ZGPR sequences. A comparison of metabolite concentrations
in the two experiments showed an underestimation in the CPMG experiment
by an average of 4.6%; however, the flat baselines obtained with the
CPMG made quantitation much easier for the smaller signals. Further,
a marginal improvement in metabolite recovery (average concentration
3.9%) could be observed when multiple extractions were performed using
methanol solvent. However, a downside of multiple extraction is that
it increases the residual macromolecular concentration (see Figure
S6 in the Supporting Information), which
apart from distorting the baseline, contributes to attenuation of
the reference compound, TSP, which is detrimental to accurate quantitation
if not corrected suitably. For example, in our case, the apparent
TSP concentration decreased by an average 3.8% in multiple extractions
compared to single extraction, using methanol.

A vast majority
of NMR-based metabolomics studies focused on blood
utilize intact blood serum or plasma without the need for sample preparation
or separation, an important characteristic that has drawn prominence
for NMR-based metabolomics. Such analysis necessitates selective suppression
of the abundant protein signals using relaxation editing NMR pulse
sequences such as CPMG that exploit the shorter T2 relaxation
times for protons in proteins. Although, protein signals are suppressed
effectively, metabolites that bind to proteins also experience shorter
T2 relaxation times and hence get suppressed completely
or partially in the resulting NMR spectra.16−18 Therefore,
intact serum/plasma NMR spectra erroneously represent concentrations
for many metabolites that bind or interact with proteins and such
spectra, while useful for comparative studies, are not useful for
the determination of absolute metabolite concentrations or comparing
NMR data with that obtained by mass spectrometry.

In the interest
of obtaining reliable metabolite concentrations
in blood using NMR, a number of explorations for alleviating protein
interference have been made. Two approaches, protein precipitation
using organic solvents and ultrafiltration, have been explored.22,23 However, a quantitative evaluation of these two approaches was not
discussed. The quantitative evaluation made in this study clearly
indicates that protein precipitation using methanol is an excellent
approach for accurate quantitation of blood metabolites. Also, evidence
from this study indicates that concentration levels for many metabolites
that potentially associate with macromolecules or with the filter
membrane are reduced (though not fully) in ultrafiltration process,
leading to their underestimation by 10 to 74% (Table 2).

Considering that metabolite quantitation in blood
is quite challenging,
sample preparation has been the subject of many investigations for
analysis using MS. Concomitantly, protein precipitation, which is
extensively used in MS, has evolved in the last several years and
optimized protocols are now available for routine analysis of blood
metabolites.7−14,27 Protein precipitation disrupts
protein binding and thus provides access to the measurement of total
metabolite concentration more quantitatively. The other approach,
ultrafiltration, which has also been investigated for MS applications
in detail, shows a significant loss of hydrophobic metabolites due
to the strong protein binding or adsorption to the membrane. As a
result, far fewer (on the order of 40%) metabolites were detected
in blood using ultrafiltration when compared to protein precipitation.14,30,31 The isotope tagged spectra in
this study also show evidence of the reduced number of metabolites
observed when using ultrafiltration.

As a result of the advancing
metabolomics technologies, the detection
of increasingly high numbers of metabolites is being reported and
there is increased interest to exploit the combined strength of NMR
and MS methods for unknown metabolite identification, biomarker discovery,
and the direct comparison of vast amounts of metabolomics literature
generated using the two powerful methods (see ref (24) and references therein).
Therefore, combined with the inferences of this study that protein
precipitation for NMR analysis offers reliable quantitative data,
incorporation of serum/plasma protein precipitation for both NMR and
MS detection opens avenues to exploit their combined strength in the
metabolomics field.

In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis
of blood serum metabolites
by NMR using two different sample preparation methods was quantitatively
evaluated based on the identification and quantitation of aqueous
metabolites. Absolute concentrations for 44 metabolites were determined
in both ultrafiltered and protein precipitated serum. Analysis by
ultrafiltration causes attenuation in NMR peak intensity for nearly
50% of the identified metabolites when compared to the results obtained
by protein precipitation using methanol. These results indicate that
serum/plasma protein precipitation using methanol provides accurate
results for metabolite concentrations and hence is potentially well
suited for routine NMR based metabolomics studies. Further, considering
the fact that protein precipitation is widely used in the MS analysis
of blood serum/plasma, incorporation of protein precipitation for
NMR provides a common approach for reliable metabolite quantitation
as well as exploiting the combined strength of NMR and MS in metabolomics
studies.
