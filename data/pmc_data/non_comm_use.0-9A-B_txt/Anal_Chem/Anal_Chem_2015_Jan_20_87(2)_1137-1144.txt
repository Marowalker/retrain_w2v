Despite
recent advances in analytical and computational chemistry,
lipid identification remains a significant challenge in lipidomics.
Ion-mobility spectrometry provides an accurate measure of the molecules’
rotationally averaged collision cross-section (CCS) in the gas phase
and is thus related to ionic shape. Here, we investigate the use of
CCS as a highly specific molecular descriptor for identifying lipids
in biological samples. Using traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry
(MS), we measured the CCS values of over 200 lipids within multiple
chemical classes. CCS values derived from ion mobility were not affected
by instrument settings or chromatographic conditions, and they were
highly reproducible on instruments located in independent laboratories
(interlaboratory RSD < 3% for 98% of molecules). CCS values were
used as additional molecular descriptors to identify brain lipids
using a variety of traditional lipidomic approaches. The addition
of CCS improved the reproducibility of analysis in a liquid chromatography-MS
workflow and maximized the separation of isobaric species and the
signal-to-noise ratio in direct-MS analyses (e.g., “shotgun”
lipidomics and MS imaging). These results indicate that adding CCS
to databases and lipidomics workflows increases the specificity and
selectivity of analysis, thus improving the confidence in lipid identification
compared to traditional analytical approaches. The CCS/accurate-mass
database described here is made publicly available.

Fueled by
novel analytical technologies
and a resurgent interest in lipid biochemistry, lipidomics has become
a widely accepted analytical approach for biomarker discovery and
translational medicine.1−4 Alterations in lipid metabolism have been associated with various
human diseases, including metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer’s
disease.2,5,6 Recently, lipidomic
studies based on mass spectrometric analysis have identified, characterized,
and quantified almost 600 lipid molecular species in human plasma.7 It is predicted, however, that thousands of currently
unknown lipids exist in biological samples.2,7,8 To partially address this problem, MS and
MS/MS lipid databases have been developed using both reference standards
and in silico methods.8−13 Yet because of the variety and complexity inherent in lipid structures,
MS-based lipid identification remains the most challenging step in
a lipidomic workflow.

Historically, chromatographic separation
has been used to maximize
lipid separation prior to MS detection. More recently, a gas-phase
separation tool such as traveling-wave ion mobility (TWIM) has been
used in combination with MS. The combined approach facilitates lipid
analysis14 by increasing peak capacity,15,16 improving structural elucidation,17−19 and separating isomeric
species.15,20−23 In TWIM-MS, an ion-mobility separation
stage consisting of a stacked-ring ion guide with RF confinement is
filled with an inert gas such as nitrogen. Ions travel through the
gas toward the MS detector propelled in an axial direction by a traveling-wave,
DC voltage.24 Ions are thus separated in
the gas phase according to their mobility through the gas, which is
related to the ions’ charge, shape, and size.

The time
required for an ion to transverse the ion-mobility separation
cell is called drift time. From the drift time values, it is possible
to derive the rotationally averaged collision cross section (CCS),
which represents the effective area for the interaction between an
individual ion and the neutral gas through which it is traveling.25−28 Thus, in addition to accurate mass data, ion mobility-derived CCS
provides an additional physicochemical measurement that can be used
for lipid annotation and identification.

In this multilaboratory
study, we investigated the use of ion mobility-derived
CCS as an additional molecular descriptor for lipid identification
using a variety of traditional lipidomics approaches. In addition,
we generated a publicly available database, containing CCS and accurate-mass
values, to support lipid identification.

Material and Methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Seelze, Germany)
and were of analytical grade, or higher, purity. Fatty acids were
purchased from Cayman Chem (Ann Arbor, Michigan USA) and Nu-Chek (Elysian,
Minnesota USA). The remaining lipid standards were all purchased from
Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama USA), including 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, ceramides, cholesterol, natural lipid
classes purified from animal tissues, and total lipid extracts from
porcine brain, E. coli, and yeast (See Table S1 in
the Supporting Information for additional
information). Frozen human brain samples (frontal cortex; age = 75.5
± 5.0 years; average, post-mortem interval = 3.2 ± 0.4 h; n = 6 ± SD) were obtained from the Banner Sun Health
Research Institute (Sun City, Arizona USA). All subjects or their
caregivers, where applicable, provided written, informed consent for
the clinical examination as well as for brain donation at the Banner
Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program. The
protocols and informed consent have been approved by the Banner Health
Institutional Review Board.

Lipid Extractions
Frozen brain samples
were rapidly
weighed and homogenized in ice-cold methanol (1 v). Lipids were extracted
by adding chloroform (2 v) and water (1 v) and centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The bottom phases were dried
under nitrogen, reconstituted in isopropanol/acetonitrile/water (4:3:1,
v/v/v; 0.1 mL), and subjected to further analysis.

CCS Measurements
Traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometers
(Synapt G2 HDMS, Waters, Corporation, Manchester, UK), located in
different laboratories, were used to derive CCS values for various
lipid classes. A mass range of m/z 50–1500, with the mass spectrometer operating in both positive
and negative electrospray ionization, was used. A summary of the MS
settings appears in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Direct injection at 5 μL/min was used. CCS values, obtained
in nitrogen, were experimentally determined using previously published
CCS values for singly charged polyalanine oligomers as the TWIM calibrant
species in both ESI+ and ESI– mode26,27 (Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Poly-dl-alanine was prepared in 50:50 (v/v) water/acetonitrile
at a concentration of 10 mg/L. Calibration was performed using singly
charged oligomers from n = 3 to n = 14. The calibration encompassed a mass range extending from 231
to 1012 Da and a CCS range extending from 151 Å2 to
306 Å2, in ESI+, and from 150 Å2 to 308 Å2, in ESI– (Table
S3 in the Supporting Information).26 CCS values were derived according to previously
reported procedures.26,28 The ion-mobility resolution was
∼40 Ω/ΔΩ(fwhm). The ion-mobility peak, or
arrival-time distribution (ATD), may represent a combination of structurally
similar isomers that remain unresolved. The CCS values reported were
determined at the apex of the ATD.29

UHPLC-TWIM-MS Lipidomic Analysis
Lipidomic analyses
of brain samples were performed with a microfluidics ionKey/MS system
composed of an ACQUITY UPLC M-Class, the ionKey source, and an iKey
CSH C18 130 Å, 1.7 μm particle size, 150 μm ×
100 mm column (Waters Corporation, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) coupled
to a Synapt G2-Si (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). Analyses were
conducted in both positive and negative electrospray mode. The capillary
voltage was 2.8 kV and the source temperature 110 °C. Injections
were 0.5 μL using partial-loop mode, with a column temperature
of 55 °C and flow rate of 3 μL/min. Mobile phase A consisted
of acetonitrile/water (60:40) with 10 mM ammonium formate +0.1% formic
acid. Mobile phase B consisted of isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10)
with 10 mM ammonium formate +0.1% formic acid. The gradient was programmed
as follows: 0.0–2.0 min from 40% B to 43% B, 2.0–2.1
min to 50% B, 2.1–12.0 min to 99% B, 12.0–12.1 min to
40% B, and 12.1–14.0 min at 40% B.

TWIM-MS Tissue Imaging
Frozen, human, brain samples
were serially sectioned in a cryostat, to allow alternate microscopic
and MS-imaging analyses. Sections were placed on standard microscope
slides and kept frozen at −15 °C throughout the analysis
using the Peltier cooled stage of the Laser Ablation Electrospray
Ionization (LAESI) DP-1000. Sections were analyzed using the LAESI
DP-1000 Direct Ionization System (Protea Bioscience, Morgantown, West
Virginia, USA) coupled with a Synapt G2-S mass spectrometer (Waters
Corporation, Manchester, UK). The electrospray solution for LAESI
was methanol/water (50:50, v/v) with 0.1% acetic acid. LAESI-TWIM-MS
parameters consisted of 10 laser pulses per pixel at 5 Hz and 800
uJ of laser energy. Data were collected in both negative- and positive-ion
mode using a mass range of m/z 50
to 1500 for MS scans as well as for ion-mobility-MS scans. Identifications
were made according to accurate-mass and CCS values. Selected drift-time
regions were extracted using Driftscope (Waters Corporation, Manchester,
U.K.). Ion distribution maps were created for mass values of interest
using ProteaPlot v2.0.3.8 (Protea Bioscience, Morgantown, West Virginia,
USA).

Data Processing and Analysis
Data processing, quantitative
analysis, and database searches were conducted using Progenesis QI
Informatics (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, U.K.). Each UHPLC-TWIM-MS
run was imported as an ion-intensity map including m/z and retention time. The software automatically
converted drift time data to CCS values using the polyalanine calibration.
Lipids were identified by searching publicly available databases (i.e.,
Human Metabolome Database (HMDB),11 METLIN,12 and LipidsMaps8)
and in-house databases containing masses, retention times, fragment
information, and ion mobility-derived CCS values.

Results and Discussion
We recently reported the first CCS database for polar metabolites,
showing its applicability and utility in supporting metabolomics experiments.28 In the present study, we extended our previous
investigation by implementing ion mobility-derived CCS in routine
lipidomics workflows. In a multilaboratory effort, we calculated CCS
values of an array of common lipid classes (Figure 1), generating a searchable database containing CCS and accurate-mass
values (Tables S4 and S5 in Supporting Information). This database was then used as an aid in identifying lipids from
brain samples.

Ion Mobility-Derived CCS Values for Lipids
To implement
the use of ion mobility in routine MS-based lipidomics workflows,
we measured the CCS of the most common lipid classes in independent
laboratories (Figure 2a,b). We obtained CCS
values for 244 lipids representing 13 lipid classes (101 values in
positive ion mode and 143 values in negative ion mode; Tables S4 and
S5 in the Supporting Information) with
an inter-laboratory RSD lower than 3% for 98% of the measurements
(Figure 2c,d). These results highlight the
fact that, as previously reported for polar metabolites,28 CCS values of lipids are highly reproducible,
independently of the particular experimental conditions employed (Table
S2 in the Supporting Information). This
reproducibility is the result of the stability of the ion mobility
technology as well as the use of calibrants that correct for variation
in the instruments’ drift times.

Figure 2 A CCS database for lipids.
A total of 244 lipids were included
in the CCS database. CCS values were obtained for different lipid
classes and subclasses in both positive ESI+ (a) and negative
ESI– ionization (b). Frequency distribution plot
of Relative Standard Deviations (RSD) obtained for the CCS measurements
of the lipid species across different laboratories in both positive
(c) and negative (d) ionization mode.

To our knowledge, this is the first report providing CCS
values
for lipid anions. The CCS values for the lipid cations agree with
those previously reported in the literature, deriving both from standard
tissue extracts measured with drift tubes29,30 or standard lipids measured with TWIM-MS17,18 (Table S6 in the Supporting Information). Such evidence indicates that power fit calibration of the TWIM-MS
device provides accurate and reliable CCS values in good agreement
with those obtained from drift tube studies.31

Ion mobility CCS measurements can, by inference, provide information
about the shape of lipid molecules. Extending what has already been
found in previous studies,14,18,32,33 CCS of various lipid classes
(e.g., phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins) and lipid subclasses
(e.g., vinyl ether phosphatidylethanolamines and acyl phosphatidylethanolamines)
fell into distinct trend lines on an m/z-versus-CCS chart, according to their chemical structures (Figure 3a and b). To confirm lipid identities, we relied
on HDMSE acquisition mode, in which precursor ions are
fragmented in a collision cell after the TWIM separation as previously
reported.15,16,19,28 These results suggest that CCS values provide an
additional coordinate of information for lipid identification and
structure confirmation.

lipid classes. (a)
Lipids classes were grouped on the basis of their m/z and CCS values. (b) Representative separation

and plasmalogen PE (PEp, blue squares), which were tentatively identified.

To test the accuracy and precision
of the CCS measurements in different
matrices, we compared the CCS values in our database with those derived
from a range of lipid extracts including porcine brain, E.
coli and yeast (Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information). Our results show that CCS values for the same
lipids are conserved between different extracts, indicating high reproducibility
of CCS measurements in varying matrices. These results also demonstrate
the wide applicability of our database across lipid extracts of various
origins to support lipid identification (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Lipid identification
is a critical step for converting data into
meaningful biological results.8,11,12,34,35 In a typical MS-based lipidomic experiment, features of interest
are usually searched against databases that list physicochemical properties
descriptive of each lipid (e.g., accurate mass). A minimum of at least
two physicochemical measures are required for confident lipid identification.36 In this context, a TWIM-MS experiment provides
two measurements for lipids identification (i.e., accurate mass and
CCS measurements) in a single acquisition. By annotating the accurate-mass
and CCS values for each species, we created a unique database of common
lipids available as a resource to the wider IM-MS community (Tables
S4 and S5, in the Supporting Information).

A UHPLC-MS Lipidomic Workflow That Exploits CCS Information
To exploit the use of ion-mobility-derived CCS information in a
typical lipidomic experiment, we analyzed human brain samples by microscale
UHPLC/TWIM-MS using an integrated microfluidic device. The goal of
this experiment was to improve the confidence in lipid identification
from biological samples using CCS as an additional coordinate of information.

An in-depth analysis of the UHPLC/TWIM-MS data revealed that each
brain sample contained more than 25 000 detectable ions. Each
ion was associated with characteristic m/z, retention time, and CCS values. Ions consistently present
in all samples were matched according to m/z < 10 ppm, retention time <6 s, and drift time <1
bin, resulting in 5151 detectable ions found in all six experiments.
The mean intralaboratory analytical precision was RSD ∼0.2%
for CCS values, compared with RSD ∼ 0.5% for retention-time
values, which is in agreement with a previous report showing that
CCS measurements are more stable and reliable than retention-time
values (Figure 4).28 Our results indicate that CCS, because of its stability and reproducibility,
increases the degrees of freedom in matching ions between data sets,
improving the accuracy and precision of both qualitative and quantitative
measurements for lipidomics analysis.

Figure 4 Intra-lab reproducibility and specificity
of analysis by separation
method. The half height widths for each of the three measured distributions
(m/z, retention time and drift time) for the human
brain lipidome across six samples, showing higher reproducibility
of drift time measurements compared to retention time values.

To identify the ions, we first
performed isotope and adduct deconvolution.
We then searched their accurate masses against publicly available
databases, including LipidMaps,8 HMDB,11 and Metlin.12 This
process disclosed more than 1300 putative candidate identifications.
Next, we cross-searched those potential identifications against our
CCS lipid database, applying ΔCCS <3% as the difference between
reference CCS values in our database and the experimental CCS values.
The combination of CCS and accurate mass increased the confidence
of identification for 137 lipids (red dots in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Such results indicate
that applying CCS information can reduce the complexity of UHPLC-MS
lipidomic results, facilitating rapid and reliable data interpretation.

Direct Analysis-MS Lipidomics Using CCS Information
Lipid
databases containing CCS values may be of particular significance
for interpreting direct-infusion MS—“shotgun”
lipidomics—or desorption ionization-MS (e.g., MS imaging) lipidomic
experiments. Such interpretations usually rely exclusively on one
physicochemical measurement (i.e., accurate mass) for lipid fingerprinting
and identification.37−41 To test this hypothesis, we exploited CCS information in typical
shotgun lipidomics and MS-imaging experiments.

CCS to Support Direct-Infusion,
or Shotgun, Lipidomics
Commonly referred to as “shotgun”
lipidomics, direct
infusion of lipid extracts into a mass spectrometer without prior
chromatographic separation provides an approach for high-throughput
lipidomics.42 Yet the approach suffers
from a reduced ability to distinguish isobaric and isomeric species
in crude lipid extracts.14,29,43

To evaluate the applicability of CCS information to a shotgun
lipidomic analysis, we infused commercially available lipid extracts
from porcine brain samples directly into the ESI-TWIM mass spectrometer,
in positive ionization mode (5 μL/min per 1 min).14,29,43 A 30 s slice of the infusion
was processed with the detection algorithm Apex3D utilizing a fixed
chromatographic peak width of 30 s.44 Lipids
were separated in two dimensions, according to CCS and m/z (Figure 5a). The additional
dimension of ion-mobility separation increased the peak capacity of
a traditional direct-infusion MS experiment more than 5-fold (Figure 5b), agreeing with previous reports.32,45 Without CCS, at a mass resolution of 35 000 (fwhm), we were
able to measure 860 independent ions, 15% of the 5639 total ions counted
(Figure 5b). Thus, the addition of CCS allowed
the resolution of 3911 additional ions (Figure 5b). The observed increase in peak capacity of analysis ultimately
allows separation of isobaric species improving lipid fingerprinting
and quantification in shotgun lipidomics applications.

Figure 5 CCS in support of shotgun
lipidomics. (a) Lipid extracts from porcine
brain were directly infused in the TWIM-MS in positive ESI mode. Lipids
were separated into two dimensions according to both CCS and m/z. The additional CCS coordinate allowed
separation and identification of near isobaric lipids, including SM
d18:1/18:0 at m/z 731.6097 and PC
40:6 at m/z 834.6021, increasing
the specificity of analysis. (b) At 35 000 mass resolution,
about 15% of the total 5639 ions were independently measured. The
addition of CCS allowed independent measurment of about 85% of the
total ions, increasing peak capacity.

We further examined the brain data set using our CCS lipid
database
to evaluate the use of mass accuracy alone versus combining CCS with
mass accuracy for identification. A cutoff of 10 ppm and CCS ±
2% in our database search criteria allowed us to identify, with high
confidence, 34 brain-lipid species, including SM d18:1/18:0 and PC
40:6 (Figure 5a; Tables S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information). Applying a cutoff of
10 ppm without any CCS filter, we found 21 mismatched lipid identifications
(false positives), compared with the results obtained using 10 ppm
and CCS as filters (Tables S7 and S8 in the Supporting
Information). Furthermore, applying a cutoff of 5 ppm without
CCS, we found nine mismatches and 13 missed matches (false negatives),
compared with the results obtained using 10 ppm and CCS as filters
(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information). These results indicate that CCS allows for applying an additional
set of tolerance criteria to shotgun lipidomics experiments, which
might result in a reduced number of false-negative and false-positive
identifications, ultimately leading to more confident compound identification.

CCS to Support MS Imaging
MS imaging provides the detailed
spatial distribution of lipid species on biological tissues. Lipids
are prominent features in MS imaging spectra of biological tissues
under most desorption ionization sources, including matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI)16,46,47 and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).48,49 Two significant challenges in MS imaging experiments are (i) accurate lipid localization, which may be affected by
the presence of confounding isobaric species,41 and (ii) lipid identification, which relies, mostly,
on accurate mass, because of the impractical nature of conducting
a large number of MS/MS experiments on a single tissue section.37,40,50

To exploit the use of CCS
information to improve MS-imaging applications, we analyzed human
brain samples using LAESI coupled to a TWIM-MS instrument. Using CCS
information allowed us to isolate lipids from metabolites, multiply
charged proteins, and peptides, and from the background ions associated
with atmospheric ionization (Figure 6a–c).
Identities of 93 lipid species were confirmed by means of both accurate-mass
and CCS measurements. Topographical maps representing the lipid ion
distribution in subregions of the human brain were created for selected
mass and CCS values present in gray matter (Figure 6d) and white matter (Figure 6e). The
use of ion mobility allowed the spatial separation of isobaric lipid
species with different CCS values, improving the quality of the signal-to-noise
ratio (Figure 6f,g). Notably, only by using
this approach was it possible to determine the selective spatial localization
of PC 34:2 in the gray matter versus ceramide C24:1 in white matter.
These results indicate that CCS information may be a significant tool
supporting lipid identification and localization in MS imaging studies.

localization in the gray matter for the extracted ion at m/z 758.5977 (4.7 ppm) and CCS 294.1 Å2 (ΔCCS< 1%) corresponding to PC 34:2 [M + H]+; (e) MS imaging of human brain depicted a selected localization
in the white matter for the extracted ion at m/z 630.6193 (−1.5 ppm) and CCS 282.5 Å2 (ΔCCS< 1%) corresponding to Cer C24:1, [M-H2O+H]+; MS imaging of human brain generated using m/z values, without CCS selection, for
PC 34:2 (f) and Cer C24:1 (g) showed low specificity and low signal-to-noise,
which ultimately affected spatial resolution.

Conclusions
In this study, we implemented
the use of ion mobility-derived CCS
measurements in lipidomics workflows to improve the specificity of
data analysis and to facilitate lipid identification. We measured
CCS values for over 200 common lipids in both positive- and negative-ion
mode across independent laboratories. The measurements showed high
reproducibility, and they were uninfluenced by instrument settings
and chromatographic conditions. We annotated these CCS values in a
unique lipid database, now available to everyone. When added to a
liquid chromatography-MS-based lipidomics workflow, CCS data improved
the reproducibility of analysis. When added to direct-MS lipidomics
approaches (e.g., “shotgun” lipidomics and MS imaging),
CCS measurements maximized the separation of isobaric species and
increased the signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, our study demonstrates
that the addition of CCS in databases and lipidomic workflows improves
the accuracy and precision of analysis and thus the confidence in
lipid assignment compared to traditional analytical approaches. We
encourage further studies to extend and populate existing lipid databases
with CCS values for lipid applications.
