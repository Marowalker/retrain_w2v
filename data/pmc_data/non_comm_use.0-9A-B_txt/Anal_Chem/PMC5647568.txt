Understanding
the mechanisms underlying plant biomass recalcitrance
at the molecular level can only be achieved by accurate analyses of
both the content and structural features of the molecules involved.
Current quantification of lignin is, however, majorly based on unspecific
gravimetric analysis after sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Hence, our research
aimed at specific lignin quantification with concurrent characterization
of its structural features. Hereto, for the first time, a polymeric 13C lignin was used as internal standard (IS) for lignin quantification
via analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric
detection in selected ion monitoring mode (py-GC-SIM-MS). In addition,
relative response factors (RRFs) for the various pyrolysis products
obtained were determined and applied. First, 12C and 13C lignin were isolated from nonlabeled and uniformly 13C labeled wheat straw, respectively, and characterized by
heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), and py-GC/MS. The two lignin isolates were found to have identical
structures. Second, 13C-IS based lignin quantification
by py-GC-SIM-MS was validated in reconstituted biomass model systems
with known contents of the 12C lignin analogue and was
shown to be extremely accurate (>99.9%, R2 > 0.999)
and
precise (RSD < 1.5%). Third, 13C-IS based lignin quantification
was applied to four common poaceous biomass sources (wheat straw,
barley straw, corn stover, and sugar cane bagasse), and lignin contents
were in good agreement with the total gravimetrically determined lignin
contents. Our robust method proves to be a promising alternative for
the high-throughput quantification of lignin in milled biomass samples
directly and simultaneously provides a direct insight into the structural
features of lignin.

==== Body
Understanding
and improving
the conversion of plant biomass heavily depends on the characterization
and quantification of its constituents. The major constituents of
poaceous plant biomasses are cellulose (30–50% (w/w)), hemicellulose
(mainly xylan) (20–40% (w/w)), and lignin (5–25% (w/w)).1 Cellulose and xylan are polysaccharides and lignin
is a cross-linked phenolic macromolecule, which is composed of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) subunits.
These subunits are linked through multiple carbon–carbon and
aryl–ether linkages, resulting in a complex structure.2 While characterization and quantification of
the plant carbohydrates are considered routine analyses, the quantification
of lignin and its subunit composition is not well established.3−5

Common quantification of lignin, still, mainly relies on gravimetric
analysis after sulfuric acid hydrolysis known as Klason-lignin analysis
or a variant hereof.6,7 The outcome of such gravimetric
analysis is highly disturbed by the presence of nonlignin acid-insoluble
material, e.g. proteins and chitin of fungal origin. In addition,
this analysis does not distinguish different lignin structures.6 Therefore, one of the main challenges for biomass
analysis is the development of an analytical tool for the specific
quantification of lignin in absolute amounts that is able to simultaneously
characterize lignin structural features in a robust and high-throughput
manner.

Solving this analytical challenge has been attempted
with vibrational
spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), both proven powerful
techniques for the structural elucidation of lignin.5,8−11 For quantification of lignin, however, serious drawbacks remained:
both techniques suffered from poor accuracy, dependency on structurally
similar calibration standards, and/or minimal structural information
that was obtained.8−11 Additionally, for NMR throughput was low.12

As an alternative, our research aimed at the development of
a rapid
and specific lignin quantification method via analytical pyrolysis
coupled to gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection (py-GC/MS).
This technique requires minimal sample amounts (10–100 μg)
and only milling of the sample is needed prior to analysis. Furthermore, py-GC/MS has been shown to enable
distinguishing
lignins’ subunits, i.e. H, G, and S substructures.13−15 In contrast, thus far, py-GC/MS has been found inaccurate for the
absolute quantification of lignin in plant biomass.16−20 That inaccuracy has been proposed to relate to two
main aspects. The first relates to the need for a proper internal
standard (IS), that during pyrolysis behaves like (native) lignin
in biomass, together with the large number of pyrolysis products formed.13,21 Second, different ratios of pyrolysis products ask for the determination
and use of (relative) response factors.16,21,22

Previously, absolute lignin quantification
by py-GC/MS and py-GC/FID
(flame ionization detection) was attempted by relating the relative
peak area of lignin-derived compounds, so-called “py-lignin”,
to lignin content as determined by gravimetric methods. The models
that were obtained showed low and/or unstable accuracy.17−20 This was a consequence of the absence of response factors for the
obtained pyrolysis products. Furthermore, the extents to which CO2 and other low molecular weight gases and char were formed
from both lignin and nonlignin components of the cell-wall upon pyrolysis
were not accounted for. Matrix-effects during pyrolysis may have further
influenced the outcomes.22−24 Alternatively, Bocchini et al.
approached lignin quantification by the measurement of lignin-derived
pyrolysis products via monomeric internal standards and the application
of response factors, which resulted in severe underestimation.16 Again, the formation of nonmonomeric pyrolysis
products was excluded and matrix-effects were expected to affect the
monomeric internal standard differently than lignin macromolecules
in biomass.

To specifically correct for the formation of nonmonomeric
pyrolysis
products from lignin and monitor matrix-effects properly, the use
of polymeric lignin as internal standard can be hypothesized for lignin
quantification by py-GC/MS, a currently unexplored field of research.

Thereto, this research aimed to apply the ideal standard, a 13C-labeled polymeric lignin isolate, for the absolute lignin
quantification by py-GC/MS. Relative response factors for lignin-derived
products were determined and applied to allow quantification, via
the 13C-lignin as internal standard, of structurally diverse
lignins in four poaceous biomasses.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals were obtained from commercial
suppliers and used without further purification. Water used in all
experiments was purified via a Milli-Q water system (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). For lignin content determination experiments, wheat straw
(WS) and corn stover (CS) were kindly provided by CNC (Milsbeek, The
Netherlands). Sugar cane bagasse (SCB) and barley straw (BS) were
supplied by Sime Darby (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) and Unifarm Wageningen
(Wageningen, The Netherlands), respectively. Compositional analysis
was performed as described in Supporting Information.

Preparation of nonlabeled and 13C-labeled wheat straw
Nonlabeled (“12C”, 98.9 atom % 12C) and uniformly 13C-labeled (“13C”,
97.7 atom % 13C) spring wheat plants (Triticum
aestivum L. cv. “Baldus”) were produced under
identical growth conditions in modified, custom designed, airtight,
high-irradiance labeling chambers of the facility ESPAS (Experimental
Soil Plant Atmosphere System, IsoLife, Wageningen, The Netherlands).25 Details of wheat straw preparation are provided
in Supporting Information.

Isolation of
lignin from 12C and 13C wheat
straw
The isolation of lignin was performed according to
a modified method reported by Björkman.26 Freeze-dried straw (3 g), either 12C or 13C, was cut to a size of 1–3 mm and acetone-extracted
for 3 h at 30 °C under magnetic stirring (750 rpm) to remove
extractives. Insoluble material was removed by filtration, dried under
a stream of nitrogen and ball milled in a PM100 planetary ball mill
(Retsch, Haan, Germany) in a 50 mL zirconium dioxide jar containing
17 φ10 mm zirconium dioxide balls at a frequency of 600 rpm
with a net milling time of 4 h. After every 15 min of milling a pause
of 10 min was set to prevent overheating. Ball milled material was
subsequently water-extracted in a concentration of 5% (w/w) at 50
°C for 15 h under magnetic stirring (750 rpm). Insoluble material
(water unextractable solids, WUS) was removed by centrifugation (60,000xg, 10 min, 20 °C) and washed 3 times with 30 mL water.
The wet residue was suspended in dioxane and adjusted to 80% aqueous
dioxane (v/v) at a material loading of 5% (w/w) and extracted twice (2 ×
24 h) at room temperature with magnetic
stirring (500 rpm) under nitrogen atmosphere. Supernatants were recovered
by centrifugation (30,000xg, 5 min, 20 °C),
combined and freeze-dried to obtain crude lignin isolates (ISOcrude).
The obtained crude isolates were purified by enzymatic carbohydrate
removal. ISOcrude was thereto suspended in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer
at pH 4.8 at 5% (w/w) material loading,
charged with 0.075% (w/w) Viscostar 150L (Dyadic, Jupiter, FL, USA)
(protein content:27 40 mg·mL–1) and incubated under rotary shaking (20 rpm) at 50 °C for 4
h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (8000xg, 5 min, 20 °C) and washed 3 times with water before
freeze-drying to obtain pure lignin isolates (LIGpure).

Compositional
analysis of total biomass and lignin isolates
Carbohydrate
content and composition, protein content, ash content
and lignin content were determined by modifications of previously
published procedures.3,15,28 Detailed procedures are provided in Supporting Information.

Characterization total biomass and lignin
isolates
NMR spectroscopy
NMR of the pure lignin isolates (12C-LIGpure and 13C-LIGpure) was performed according
to Del Río et al.29 For NMR
experiments 12 mg 12C-LIGpure was dissolved in 450 μL
DMSO-d6, while for 13C-LIGpure
1.3 mg was dissolved in 450 μL DMSO-d6. The HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) NMR-experiments
were recorded with a hsqcetgpsisp2.2 pulse sequence on a Bruker AVANCE
III 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany)
equipped with a 5 mm cryo-probe. The internal temperature of the probe
was set at 298 K. The spectral widths were 6000 Hz (10–0 ppm)
for the 1H-dimension and 25000 Hz (165–0 ppm) for
the 13C-dimension. The number of complex points was 2048
in the 1H-dimension, 32 scans were collected with a relaxation
time of 1.5 s. In the 13C-dimension, 256 time increments
were recorded. The 1JCH was
set at 145 Hz. The data was processed with Bruker TopSpin 3.2 software.
For the Fourier transformation in the 1H-dimension, Gaussian
apodization was used. For the 13C-dimension, zero-filling
up to 1024 was applied prior to Fourier transformation with a squared
cosine window function. Zero-order phase correction was performed
manually. The DMSO solvent-peak was set as internal reference at δC 39.5; δH 2.49 ppm. HSQC correlation peaks
were assigned by comparison with literature.29−31 Semiquantitative
analysis of the volume integrals was performed according to Del Río
et al.29

py-GC/MS
Pyrolysis
was performed with an EGA/PY-3030D
Multishot pyrolyzer (Frontier Laboratories, New Ulm, MN, USA) equipped
with an AS-1020E Autoshot autosampler. The pyrolyzer was coupled to
GC-MS using a Trace GC equipped with a DB-1701 fused-silica caplillary
column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. 0.25 μm film thickness) coupled
to a DSQ-II mass spectrometer (both Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Pyrolysis, GC and MS settings were based on previously described
research.15 Samples were weighed using
a XP6 excellence-plus microbalance (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH,
USA). Pyrolysis of total biomass (80–90 μg) and lignin
isolates (20–30 μg) was performed at 500 °C for
1 min with an interface temperature of 300 °C. Pyrolysis products
were injected on the column via split/splitless injection (at 250
°C) with a splitratio of 1:133 and helium was used as carrier
gas with constant flow at 1.5 mL·min–1. The
GC oven was programmed from 70 °C (2 min) to 270 °C at 5
°C·min–1 and held at 270 °C for 15
min. MS detection was used with EI at 70 eV, a source temperature
of 250 °C, a scan range of m/z 50–550 and a scan rate of 4.0 scans/sec. Compounds were identified
by comparing retention time and mass spectrum with standards, the
NIST library and data published by Ralph and Hatfield.13 Results were combined in a (12C)
target library. A unique 13C target library was built on
the basis of retention time and expected fragmentation from 12C mass spectra and carbon number.

For qualitative analysis,
pyrograms were processed by AMDIS software (version 2.71, NIST, USA).
For identification and deconvolution the following software settings
were used: minimum match factor at 60 with multiple identifications
per compound, component width at 20, adjacent peak subtraction at
two, resolution at high, sensitivity at very high and shape requirements
at low. Compounds identified on the basis of reference standards were
annotated by evaluation of retention time (±0.1 min), reverse
search (≥80) and simple search (≥45). Peak molar area
was calculated as defined by Del Río et al.32 All samples were analyzed in triplicate.

Absolute lignin quantification using py-GC/MS
Relative response factor
determination of pyrolysis products
Relative response factors
of 21 (of a total of 46) lignin-derived
pyrolysis products, indicated in Table 1 with an asterisk, were determined by injecting an
equimolar mixture of authentic standards and 9-fluorenone as internal
standard into the py-GC/MS system.21 Standards
and 9-fluorenone were dissolved in 50:50 (v/v) Ethanol (EtOH):Chloroform
(CHCl3) in a concentration of 10 mM, taking the declared
purity of the standard into account, and mixed to give an equimolar
solution of 0.45 mM. All solutions were kept in amber vials with minimal
exposure to air and kept at −20 °C. Five microliter of
the equimolar mixture was injected into a pyrolysis cup and directly
measured by py-GC/MS as described in section ‘Characterization
total biomass and lignin isolates–py-GC/MS’
in triplicate. Different injection volumes were tested and showed
similar relative response factors, confirming linearity of the response
over the used concentration range. Stability of compounds during pyrolysis,
i.e. the formation of a single compound peak only, was confirmed by
injecting all compounds individually at 0.4 mM mixed with 9-fluorenone
at the same concentration. Xcalibur 2.2 was used for data analysis.
The two most abundant fragments per compound were used for quantification
(Table 1). Peak areas
(Ai) were manually integrated to avoid erroneous integration
by method settings and normalized for molarity (Mi). Areas
for cis-isoeugenol and trans-isoeugenol
were summed as they were present as a mixture. Relative response factors
(RRFs) were calculated versus the highest peak area (4-ethylphenol,
A4EP) normalized for molarity (M4EP) according
to eq 1. 1  where i refers to compound
number (Table 1). cis- and trans-isomers were assumed to
have similar RRFs. RRFs for pyrolysis products for which no commercial
standard was available were estimated from structurally closest molecules
(Table 1). In addition,
RRFs of cis-/trans-coniferyl alcohol
and cis-/trans-sinapyl alcohol were
estimated from their aldehyde analogues, as they were shown to be
insufficiently stable to analyze via “liquid injection”.
Molar RRFs (12C) were assumed to be similar for 13C analogues.

13C lignin internal
standard based lignin quantification
in reconstituted biomass model systems
12C-LIGpure
was dissolved in 50:50 (v/v) EtOH:CHCl3 in a concentration
of 1.0 mg·mL–1. 10–35 μL of this
solution was added to 40–65 μg cellulose to obtain 75
μg “reconstituted” biomass (msample) with six different lignin contents (12–43% (w/w)) and dried
at 30 °C for 1 h. 13C-LIGpure (=internal standard,
IS) was dissolved in a similar manner. Ten microliter IS solution
of 1.0 mg·mL–1 (mIS) was added to
the reconstituted biomass and dried overnight at room temperature
before analysis. All samples were prepared and analyzed by py-GC/MS
in triplicate.

Py-GC/MS settings and data processing for
quantitative analyses
The pyrolysis and GC setup used was
similar to the qualitative
analysis. MS detection was applied in selected ion monitoring (SIM)
mode. The two most abundant fragments per compound were monitored,
with a maximum of 8 fragments (4 12C + 4 13C)
per segment (Table 1). Dwell time was set at 25 ms to ensure at least 25 data points
per peak. Data was processed using Xcalibur 2.2. Peaks were integrated
using ICIS peak integration where smoothing points was set at 5, area
noise factor was set at 5, peak noise factor was set at 10 and baseline
window optimized per compound (range 12–55). A manual correction
was only applied when irregular peak shapes lead to erroneous peak
integration with method settings. Areas were normalized by dividing
by RRFs and summed (Ai/RRFi, where
i refers to the compound number in Table 1). To correct for the higher molecular weight
and concomitant lower response per weight of 13C pyrolysis
products, a correction factor for detected 13C total area
was included. This correction factor was determined by calculating
total molar area of 13C-LIGpure on the basis of 12C and 13C pyrolysis product molecular weights (Table 1) as described by
Del Río et al.32 in >25
samples.
The calculated correction factor was equal to 1.057 with a standard
deviation below 0.05%. Lignin content was quantified following eq 2. 2  where i refers to compound
number (Table 1), A is area, RRF is relative response factor (Table 1), mIS is the amount of IS (μg; 13C-LIGpure), msample is the amount of sample (μg), and PIS is a correction factor for
the purity of the IS (0.895). In i, compounds 15,
22, and 23 were not included.

Application of 13C lignin IS method for lignin quantification
Lignin in water-unextractable
solids (WUS) of WS, CS, BS, and SCB,
obtained as described in the Supporting Information, was quantified using the novel method as described in the section
“Py-GC/MS settings and data processing for quantitative analysis”.
Approximately 75 μg of material was mixed with 10 μL of 13C-IS solution (1.0 mg·mL–1) and dried
at 30 °C for 3 h. All samples were prepared and analyzed by py-GC/MS
in triplicate and compared to Klason lignin content (AIL corrected
for ash and protein + ASL).

Results and Discussion
The quantification potential of our new approach could best be
evaluated using reconstituted biomass model systems, on the basis
of structurally similar 12C and 13C lignins
to which cellulose was added, to mimic a plant biomass matrix. This
allowed us to evaluate the performance of the novel method on samples
with a known, “true” lignin content, without relying
on inaccurate and unselective procedures. Thereto, first lignin was
isolated from nonlabeled (“12C”) and uniformly 13C-labeled (“13C”) wheat straw that
was produced under identical growth conditions.

Compositional analysis
of lignin isolates
The abundance
of the main constituents of the lignin isolates is indicated in Table 2. Lignin content was
calculated as the remaining content of dry matter after subtraction
of carbohydrates, protein, and ash, since acetone and water extractives
were removed prior to dioxane extraction. High purity (∼90%)
isolates were obtained, with carbohydrates as the most abundant impurity
(∼7%). The carbohydrate contents of the isolates were approximately
two times lower than previously reported for unpurified dioxane/milled
wood lignins, achieved by water extraction prior to and enzymatic
carbohydrate removal after dioxane extraction.33 Enzymatic purification is considered a milder and less
laborious alternative compared to the commonly used chemical workup
procedure, maintaining efficiency.26,34 The significant
amount of protein (nitrogen) found in the isolates was likely the
result of protein adsorption, although coextraction has been reported
as well.35,36 Estimated lignin contents of 12C and 13C wheat straw (total biomass) were 20.6 ±
0.8% (w/w) and 19.3 ± 1.3% (w/w), respectively, and used for
calculation of isolation yields.15 Final
lignin isolation yields of approximately 20% were achieved for both
isolates, which is in line with literature on lignin isolates obtained
from wheat straw with a similar extraction procedure.29

Characterization of lignin isolates
The lignin isolates
were characterized by 2D-NMR to provide information on the interunit
linkages present within the lignins. Chemical shift assignments were
based on previous studies.29−31 The aliphatic (δC/δH 50–90/2.5–6.0) and aromatic/unsaturated
(δC/δH 90–160/6.0–8.0)
regions of the recorded HSQC spectra along with the structures of
the assigned correlation peaks are shown in Supporting Information Figures S-1 and S-2. Clear lignin signals could
be observed in the aromatic region (S2,6, G2, H2,6, and several tricin, p-coumarate,
and ferulate related signals). The aliphatic region was dominated
by methoxyl group- and β-O-4′ substructure
(A, A′, and Aox) related correlation peaks. Other
interunit linkages such as phenylcoumaran (B) and resinol (C), and
to a lesser extent spirodienone (F) and dibenzodioxocins (D) substructures,
were also observed in the HSQC spectra. α,β-Diaryl ether (E) substructures, the presence of which was confirmed
by del Río et al., albeit in minor amounts, could not
be detected in the isolated lignins.29 A
summary of the relative abundance of the aromatic units and interunit
linkages of the 12C and 13C lignin isolates,
determined by semiquantitative analysis, is presented in Table 3.

Besides lignin, multiple carbohydrate-related signals (δC/δH 65–80/2.8–3.6) were readily
detectable in both isolates, despite their relatively low abundance
(Table 2), which could
provide additional information on the structural features of carbohydrates
and lignin involved in lignin–carbohydrate complexes (LCC).
This is not further discussed in this paper.

The distribution
of aromatic units and lignin interunit linkages
closely matched with earlier reports on HSQC NMR analyses of wheat
straw lignin.29,31,33 Hence, it was concluded that the isolated lignins were representative
of lignin in wheat straw. In addition, a highly similar relative abundance
of lignin interunit linkages and aromatic units was found for both
isolates. This good similarity of the 12C and 13C lignins was further used for py-GC/MS analysis to identify and
annotate for the first time pyrolysis products formed from 13C lignin.

Pyrograms of the two lignin isolates can be found
in Supporting Information Figure S-3. Due
to the
lack of authentic 13C standards, 13C pyrolysis
products were identified on the basis of expected retention time (Rt,12C = Rt,13C)
and molecular ion (M+•13C = M+•12C + carbon number) and fragmentation spectra of their 12C counterparts. The 12C and 13C MS
fragmentation spectra of two abundant lignin-related pyrolysis products
are shown in Figure 1. Identical fragmentation behavior was observed for 12C and 13C analogues. MS fragmentation spectra of all other
identified 13C lignin-related pyrolysis products are presented
in Supporting Information Figure S-4.

pyrograms with peak annotation can be found in Supporting Information Figure S-3.

Like NMR, py-GC/MS analysis revealed that the chemical composition
of the isolated 12C and 13C lignins was highly
similar. Furthermore, all lignin-related pyrolysis products found
for the isolates were also present in “native” lignin
in total biomass, although their relative distribution differed (Table 4). Note that in Table 4 the data were not
corrected for relative response factors (see text below) to allow
comparison with literature. Most profound were the lower relative
amounts of unsubstituted and vinyl substituted compounds in the isolates
and higher amounts of methyl substituted and oxygen containing products,
which is in line with findings by Del Río et al.29

The lower amount of vinyl substituted
products in the isolates
can be explained by the fact that a significant part of the detected
vinyl compounds arise from structures that cross-link lignin to arabinoxylan,
like ferulic acid, that could remain in the residue after dioxane
extraction.37 Furthermore, changes in the
relative distribution of structural features might be the result of
modification and/or selective extraction of a specific lignin population.

It should be noted that in py-GC/MS lignin interunit linkages as
well as p-coumarate (pCA) and ferulate
(FA) lead to the formation of the same pyrolysis products, namely
4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively, and can therefore
not be independently quantified.38,39 Interestingly,
our findings showed that when relative response factors for pyrolysis
products, discussed in the next section, were taken into account,
the relative distribution of aromatic units by py-GC/MS (H:G:S = 15:58:26) and NMR
(including pCA and FA)
(H:G:S = 13:56:31) were in good agreement. This showed that the commonly
found discrepancy between py-GC/MS and NMR partially originates from
the analytical approach, and heavily depends on the used definition
of lignin.37

Lignin quantification in
a reconstituted biomass model system
After establishing a
complete pyrolysis product library for 12C and 13C products, as explained in the previous
section, a py-GC-SIM-MS method was set up for quantification purposes.
By applying 13C lignin as internal standard, the necessity
of monitoring the formation of nonmonomeric pyrolysis products from
lignin, such as CO2 or char, is bypassed. Furthermore,
matrix effects during pyrolysis and system performance are corrected
for properly via the use of polymeric 13C lignin as internal
standard. In our opinion, this can be seen as huge improvement compared
to previous lignin quantification attempts by py-GC/MS.16−20,22

Selected ion monitoring
(SIM) was used for detection as this MS-mode benefits from a significant
reduction of background noise and therefore lowers the limit of quantification.
Previously it was shown that the lignin-derived pyrolysis products
of various grasses, soft- and hardwoods are similar, although their
distribution is different.17,20,29,32 Monitoring all identified lignin-derived
pyrolysis products (43, Table 1) thereto ensured unbiased and complete quantification, also
when the method is ultimately applied on samples with different product
ratios.

Quantification with 13C lignin as internal
standard
(IS) requires the simultaneous measurement of 12C-sample
derived and 13C-IS derived products. Therefore, the number
of quantified products is equal to 86. Pyrograms were thereto divided
in segments to ensure sufficient data points per peak.

To prove
the principle of 13C lignin internal standard
based quantification via py-GC/MS, the developed method was applied
on 12C lignin with close to identical structure (Tables 3 and 4) in reconstituted biomass systems, with known lignin content.
The pyrolysis products derived from cellulose in these mixtures were
similar as previously reported, of which levoglucosan was the most
abundant, and did not interfere with lignin analysis.13,23 In the latter setup similar relative abundance of lignin-derived
pyrolysis products (molar based) in the used 12C lignin
and 13C lignin internal standard circumvented the need
for response factor corrections and allowed the use of total peak
area for quantification directly. However, as a consequence of weight-based
quantification, a correction factor was required to compensate for
the molecular weight differences between 12C and 13C pyrolysis products. This correction factor was calculated from
the difference in 12C and 13C molecular weight
based total molar peak area calculated for the same IS sample. As
a result, it was found that 13C total areas should be multiplied
with a correction factor of 1.057. Resulting correlations for 12C lignin input and 13C lignin IS-based quantified 12C lignin amount are shown in Figure 2. It can be observed from the slope of the
equation (0.974) and excellent linearity (R2 > 0.998)
that 12C lignin can be correctly quantified on the basis
of the 13C lignin internal standard in the applied lignin
content
range. The high reproducibility (RSD < 1.5%) was achieved by solubilizing
the lignin isolates in 50:50 (v/v) EtOH:CHCl3 and pipetting
specified volumes, opposed to the use of a microbalance. Besides improving
reproducibility, this approach facilitated high-throughput sample
preparation.

To allow the ultimate use of the
internal standard for the quantification
of lignins with dissimilar relative distribution of pyrolysis products
as well, relative molar response factors (RRFs) were determined and
applied. RRFs are of utmost importance since they include compound
stability during pyrolysis at 500 °C, transfer efficiency through
injector and column and sensitivity of the detector as a result of
ionization efficiency and ion coverage by the monitored fragments
in SIM. An overview of the relative response factors of all lignin-derived
pyrolysis products can be found in Table 1. The relative response factors that were
obtained were different from RRFs calculated from calibration curves
published by Groenewold et al.21 Underlying
might be different ion coverages as a result of a different number
of fragments that were followed per compound. Furthermore, the lability
of compounds during pyrolysis at 500 °C was taken into account
in our approach, while Groenewold et al. determined RRFs directly
with MS without pyrolysis.21 By applying
the RRFs, correcting for small differences in the relative composition
of the pyrolysis products between the 12C and 13C isolates (Table 4), the obtained slope was similar to the theoretical slope of 1 (1.001)
and resulted in excellent accuracy (>99.9%) across the measured
lignin
content range (Figure 2). Surprisingly, highly similar outcomes were obtained when RRFs
of Groenewold et al. were applied (data not shown).21

Considerations regarding the selectivity of 13C-IS
lignin quantification
In grasses, relatively high amounts
of p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid are present,
that form similar products as “core lignin” upon pyrolysis,
and can thus not be distinguished.13 Both
coumarylation and feruloylation of arabinoxylan and lignin have been
described in the literature and potentially could be a source of error
when quantifying lignin on the basis of the formed pyrolysis products.
Nevertheless, the major part of the hydroxycinammic acids found in
grasses is thought to be attached to lignin and is considered an integral
part of it, rather than being present as “free decorations”
of arabinoxylan.37,40 Hence, all vinylic pyrolysis
products are assumed to be fully lignin-derived.

Traces of selected
masses for 12C pyrolysis products at given retention times
were detected in the 13C lignin isolate, and vice versa,
but did not form a significant interference (<1% of total peak
area) and were therefore neglected. Further, the pyrolysis products
phenol, 2-methylphenol, and 4-methylphenol can originate from both
lignin and nonlignin components of the cell wall (like aromatic amino
acids in protein) (data not shown). These products were fully included
in our lignin quantification as they comprised only a minor part (<1%
of total peak area) of lignin-derived products. Nevertheless, to avoid
significant interference in samples that are high in protein and low
in lignin, it is suggested to monitor the formation of indole as protein
marker pyrolysis product (Rt 17.81 min, m/z 117) and correct detected areas for phenol, 2-methylphenol,
and 4-methylphenol accordingly.41

Extensive changes in the relative distribution of pyrolysis products
over the applied full range (10 to 35 μg) were not observed,
indicating that besides content, valuable information about the lignin
structure can be obtained concurrently. To further explore the potential
of the novel quantitative method, 13C IS based lignin quantification
was applied on four different common poaceous biomass sources and
compared to the classical Klason method. Compositional data of these
four grasses is presented in Supporting Information Tables S-1 and S-2.

Lignin quantification in poaceous biomass
In Figure 3, a comparison
is
shown between lignin content as quantified by the classical Klason
lignin method and the novel 13C-IS based py-GC-SIM-MS method.
The results of Klason lignin analysis are presented as acid-insoluble
lignin (AIL) corrected for ash and protein and acid-soluble lignin
(ASL). AIL determined by this method is often not corrected or contaminated
with chitin from fungal origin that cannot be corrected for.15,17,20 The importance of ash correction
was clearly demonstrated as ash contents of hydrolysis residues (AI
ash) up to 25% (w/w) were found. Even though the amount of acid-insoluble
protein was rather limited (∼4% of hydrolysis residue), it
might be important to be taken into account for more protein-rich
samples. The spectrophotometric analysis of ASL depends highly on
the used wavelength and corresponding extinction coefficients. As
a result of different lignin compositions per biomass, extinction
coefficients vary per biomass. Since the determination of this extinction
coefficient is laborious, all types of biomass were analyzed at the
same wavelength (205 nm) with an averaged extinction coefficient (110
g·L–1·cm–1), based on
the literature.7,42,43 For that reason the ASL-content based on the common Klason protocol
does not result in an accurate lignin content. Lignin contents determined
according to Klason (AIL and ASL) agreed well with previous studies
on these biomasses and were therefore considered valid for the evaluation
of the performance of the novel method.29,44,45

py-GC-SIM-MS
(triplicate) and Klason (duplicate). WS: wheat straw, CS: corn stover,
BS: barley straw, SCB: sugar cane bagasse, AI: acid-insoluble, AS:

The lignin contents of
the four biomasses quantified via the 13C-IS py-GC/MS approach
were in good accordance with the classical
Klason method (AIL + ASL) with an insignificant relative deviation
on the order of 5%. High reproducibility was obtained for the lignin
content of all biomasses (RSD < 7%). Compared to previous py-GC/MS
attempts on lignin quantification, our novel method thus showed greatly
enhanced accuracy and reproducibility, with acceptable costs and time-investments.16−20,22 The latter is concluded from
the fact that from 1 g of 13C labeled wheat straw 45 mg
of 90% pure 13C lignin internal standard can be isolated
in 1 week, which is sufficient to perform 45 000 pyrolysis
runs. Compared to external 12C lignin based quantification,
significant enhancements in terms of accuracy were achieved by applying 13C lignin as internal standard (Supporting Information Figure S-5), indicating the importance of matrix-effects
during pyrolysis.

The use of extractive-free biomasses ensured
compounds potentially
interfering with lignin-analysis by py-GC/MS analysis to be removed.
Furthermore, the presence of ash and/or chitin (in fungal treated
biomass) does not interfere with py-GC/MS analysis, as potential matrix-effects
are corrected for by the internal standard approach and all chitin-derived
pyrolysis products can be distinguished from lignin-derived products.
Thereto, the sum of the lignin derived pyrolysis products was a reliable
representation of lignin content and lignin content could thus be
similarly determined as shown for reconstituted biomass samples. Due
to the fact that the internal standard was added as a liquid and subsequently
dried, the internal standard was well dispersed throughout the sample.
The use of a microfurnace pyrolyzer combined with low standardized
particle size (<250 μm) and standardized low sample amount
(∼75 μg) furthermore ensured rapid pyrolysis with heating
rates expected to be >2000 °C·s–1.23,24 The mechanisms underlying pyrolysis were thereto expected not to
differ between sample lignin and internal standard lignin.

The
application of relative response factors (Table 1) enabled us to accurately determine
the contents of lignins that were structurally distinct and dissimilar
from the structure of the internal standard as well (Table 5 and Figure S-5). This flexibility is a clear benefit compared to existing
alternatives for the quantification of lignin content in plant biomass,
that depend on structurally similar calibration standards.8−11 Future analysis of a larger variety of biomasses, including softwoods,
hardwoods, and chemically and/or enzymatically modified ones, will
further improve understanding of the performance of our 13C-IS based novel method for lignin quantification.

As previously discussed in
the section “Characterization of lignin
isolates”, the relative
composition of the lignin subunits as found by py-GC/MS when RRFs
were applied was comparable to 2D-NMR. Besides content, valuable information
on the subunit composition of the biomasses could thus be obtained
concurrently. A more accurate view on the composition of the pyrolysates
was obtained and demonstrated the importance of oxygen-containing
pyrolysis products (Cα-O, Cβ-O,
and Cγ-O) for describing lignins structural features
(Table 5).

Conclusions
Here, we describe a novel method for the concurrent quantification
of absolute lignin content and subunit composition in plant biomass.
By employing a 13C-labeled polymeric lignin isolate as
internal standard (IS) for the first time and correcting for relative
response factors of the formed lignin-derived pyrolysis products,
py-GC/MS could be applied for this purpose. Our 13C lignin
IS based approach was validated in biomass model systems containing
a structurally similar 12C lignin analogue with known lignin
contents. Structurally distinct lignins in four common poaceous biomass
sources were quantified with an insignificant relative deviation in
the order of 5% compared to classic gravimetric analysis. The simultaneous
acquirement of structural information with high reproducibility in
a more high-throughput fashion makes our method a huge improvement
compared to current alternative methods for lignin quantification.
We reckon that our new lignin quantification method opens up possibilities
for more accurate analysis of lignin content and subunit composition
in various research fields dealing with lignin containing plant biomass.
