This
work presents the design, fabrication, and characterization
of a robust 3D printed microfluidic analysis system that integrates
with FDA-approved clinical microdialysis probes for continuous monitoring
of human tissue metabolite levels. The microfluidic device incorporates
removable needle type integrated biosensors for glucose and lactate,
which are optimized for high tissue concentrations, housed in novel
3D printed electrode holders. A soft compressible 3D printed elastomer
at the base of the holder ensures a good seal with the microfluidic
chip. Optimization of the channel size significantly improves the
response time of the sensor. As a proof-of-concept study, our microfluidic
device was coupled to lab-built wireless potentiostats and used to
monitor real-time subcutaneous glucose and lactate levels in cyclists
undergoing a training regime.

==== Body
Wearable
sensors connected to
body sensor networks (BSN)1 that provide
real-time information about the wearer’s health and fitness2 are of great interest both academically and commercially.
Developments of such platforms have mainly focused on sensors that
measure physical vital signs (e.g. pulse rate, ECG). Biosensors targeting
physiologically relevant analytes are more challenging but can provide
important information about tissue health3 and fitness,4,5 allowing, for example, athletes
to tailor their training to their individual characteristics, enabling
them to assess their training effectiveness, to make adjustments,
and to track improvements in their performance.

Extensive research
efforts have focused on the development of miniaturized
on-body chemo/biosensors for the measurement of physiological analytes
in different bodily fluids, such as interstitial fluid,6,7 sweat,8,9 tears,10,11 and saliva.12,13 Glucose and lactate are particularly attractive biomarkers to monitor
as they provide information about tissue energy metabolism. Lactate,
in particular, has received much interest for sports monitoring. During
intense exercise, tissue oxygen levels are insufficient for aerobic
metabolism to meet the energy demands of the body. Instead, anaerobic
metabolism occurs to meet these increased energy demands, leading
to elevated lactate levels. Lactate can therefore be used as a measure
of how hard the body is working, allowing athletes to modulate their
effort accordingly, in order to train the body to increase its efficiency
in clearing excess lactate or to avoid causing damage by overtraining.

Commercially available blood lactate and glucose meters are used
for sports applications.14 Although blood
measurements provide important information about global metabolite
levels in the body, the use of finger-prick test strips has several
limitations. The main limitation of discrete sampling is the lack
of temporal resolution, with the result that it is not possible to
observe dynamic changes in metabolite levels. In order to improve
temporal resolution blood samples have to be taken regularly, resulting
in constant interruptions during the activity period. In contrast,
online microdialysis allows continuous monitoring of tissue metabolites,
which, when coupled with an online analysis system, provides good
temporal resolution, suitable for resolving dynamic changes.15−17 The microdialysis probe consists of a semipermeable membrane that
is perfused with a solution that matches the extracellular fluid.
Formation of a concentration gradient across the membrane allows exchange
of molecules between the probe and the tissue, creating a dialysate
stream that can be analyzed for compounds of interest. Microdialysis
has been used in a wide range of applications and is an attractive
technology for human in vivo monitoring, as commercial
FDA-approved probes are available. Microdialysis combined with online
analysis systems has been used extensively to detect tissue health
and ischemic events.18−21 In particular, the lactate/glucose ratio has been shown to be an
especially sensitive marker of tissue health, providing a clear indication
as to whether tissue energy demands are being met.16,19,22

There is a natural synergy between
microdialysis and microfluidic
devices because high time resolution analysis of low volume flow rates
requires very small internal volumes.17,20,23 Conventionally, microfluidic devices have been made
using methods such as PDMS-based soft lithography due to their ease
of fabrication. PDMS chips have been used extensively for proof-of-concept
analysis devices for mass spectrometry,24 as well as for optical23,25 and electrochemical
detection.20,26,27 In all cases the analyzer is a large device placed on a bench near
the experimental subject. In our current PDMS-needle biosensor system
this requires >1 m of connection tubing between the probe and the
PDMS chip, leading to a 25 min delay before analysis at 1 μL/min
flow rate, as well as a broadened temporal response due to Taylor
dispersion.28 Furthermore, our current
method for manually positioning the needle electrode biosensors inside
the PDMS chamber is impractical for a wearable device as movement
caused by exercise leads to repositioning of the biosensor inside
the microfluidic channel leading to noise and decreased sensitivity.27

Fast responding wearable devices need
to be small and robust and
placed close to the microdialysis probe outlet.29 For reliability, they require a robust low-volume connection
to the probe and should ideally incorporate biosensors as easily replaceable
modules, given the possibility of biosensor failure during high-value
monitoring of athletes.

Recently, there has been great interest
in the use of 3D printing
for the fabrication of microfluidic devices.30−34 This rapid prototyping methodology is particularly
attractive as it enables one-step fabrication of a microfluidic platform.35 It also enables dimensional control of the device,
so that it can be integrated with commercially available components.30 The versatility of this fabrication method allows
for a flexible, modular-approach to device design with each part designed
to meet exact requirements. It also allows for design modifications
to be made quickly and easily so that device features can be adjusted
iteratively, and their influence on the device performance can be
evaluated.30,35 Erkal et al. recently reported
on the fabrication of 3D printed microfluidic devices with integrated
electrodes for electrochemical detection.30 These devices were fabricated using commercial flangeless fitting
nuts to house the electrodes, which integrated with microfabricated
receiving ports.

Here, we show for the first time, the development
of a 3D printed
microfluidic device that integrates with FDA-approved clinical microdialysis
probes and incorporates needle type biosensors and which can be used
for continuous monitoring of human tissue metabolite levels. As a
proof-of-concept, the device is employed for online monitoring of
lactate and glucose tissue levels during cycling trials, providing
a robust and reliable platform with potential use for wearable sensing
technologies.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Glucose
oxidase (GOx) from Aspergillus
niger and lactate oxidase (LOx) from Aerococcus viridians were purchased from Sekisui Diagnostics. Polyurethane (Texin 985)
was obtained from Bayer. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Electrode Fabrication
The biosensors used in this work
are based on combined needle electrodes.20,36 Briefly, a 50 μm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insulated
platinum/iridium (90%:10%) wire (Advent Research Materials, UK) and
a 50 μm polyester insulated silver wire were threaded through
a 27G hypodermic needle. The insulation layer was removed from the
ends of the wires using a small flame, to expose the metal. The ends
of the two wires were each connected to an electrical wire using conductive
silver epoxy glue (RS Components, UK). Epoxy resin (Robnor resins,
CY1301 and HY1300) was used to fill the needle and to secure the wires
in place. Once the epoxy resin was cured, the sharp tip of the needle
was abraded using sandpaper (Buehler, UK), to just above the bevel
of the needle, to create silver and platinum disc electrodes. The
blunt needle was then polished sequentially with alumina slurries
(1, 0.3, and 0.05 μm). Finally, in order to create the Ag|AgCl
reference electrode, the tip of the needle was dipped into a potassium
dichromate reference solution (BASi, US) for 3 s, and then into a
solution of diluted 37% hydrochloric acid for 20 s, to remove the
oxide layer from the working and auxiliary electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry
was used to assess the working electrode surface.

Biosensor Fabrication
All biosensors were controlled
using in-house potentiostats and a PowerLab 8/35, controlled by LabChart
Pro (ADInstruments). Glucose and lactate biosensors were fabricated
in several layers, as shown in Figure 1-B. Layer i: The working electrode was first coated with poly
m-phenylenediamine (m-PD) using electropolymerization, to screen out
potential interferences. Briefly, the combined needle electrode was
placed in a 100 mM solution of m-phenylenediamine in 0.01 M PBS at
pH 7.4. The potential was held at 0 V for 20 s, 0.7 V for 20 min for
electropolymerization to occur, and then 0 V for 5 min. The electrode
was gently rinsed with deionized water, and cyclic voltammetry was
used to verify that the working electrode had been successfully coated. Layer ii: After successful electropolymerization of the
screening layer, the electrodes were dipped into the enzyme solution
(60 mg/mL LOx or GOx, 30 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 60 mg/mL poly(ethylene
glycol) diglycidyl ether, and 2% v/v glycerol in
0.01 M PBS, adapted from the method described by Vasylieva et al.37,38). The needles were placed in an oven at 55 °C for 2 h. Layer iii: Following enzyme immobilization, biosensors were
also coated with a polyurethane film in order to extend their dynamic
range to include the higher lactate levels possible in exercising
tissue and to minimize the effect of any flow variations, which could
occur in a flow-cell, on biosensor response.

Fabrication of Microfluidic
Platform
Two different
3D printers were used for printing of the microfluidic platform. The
microfluidic chip was fabricated using a 3D printer ULTRA 3SP. This
machine provides 100 μm resolution in the X- and Y-axis and between 25 and 100 μm resolution
in the Z-axis, depending on the parameters set. However,
the true resolution of the printer is given by the voxel dimension
and the material employed during fabrication. Throughout the development
of this work, the “ABS 3SP White” resist was used for
printing of the microfluidic chip. ABS 3SP White allows printing of
dimensionally and mechanically stable components, although due to
shrinkage of the resist in the printing process smaller dimensions
than those specified in the design of the microfluidic channel were
observed. In general, a tolerance of about 100 μm needs to be
considered during the design of the components. The microfluidic platform
was designed with an L-shape, in which the inner microfluidic channel
incorporates a 90° bend (Figure S1-A). As the microfluidic chip needs to integrate two separate needle
biosensors, one for glucose and the other for lactate sensing, it
was decided to insert the two needles into the microfluidic channel
through two round openings printed on the top wall of the microchannel
(Figure S1-C). This configuration ensures
a tidy and compact packaging of the overall platform, as shown in
Figure 1-j. However, it limits the minimum
microchannel width that is achievable, as it has to fit the 27G needle
(Ø = ca. 413 μm) biosensors. Three different sizes of microfluidic
channels were printed and tested, which had different height and width
dimensions, these were as follows: (1) 520 × 520 μm, (2)
750 × 550 μm, and (3) 1000 × 550 μm. Moreover,
taking into account the material shrinkage, for channel (1) two slightly
wider microfluidic chambers were designed at the two needle biosensor
insertion locations (Figure S1-B) to avoid
issues during placement of the biosensors.

Printing of the needle
holders was performed using the Objet260 Connex 3D printer. The main
advantage of using this printer compared to the ULTRA 3SP is the possibility
to print rigid and soft material simultaneously on the same component.
For instance, VeroWhitePlus (RGD835) and TangoBlack (FLX973) were
employed for the printing of the rigid and soft parts, respectively.
To fix the position of the needle biosensor inside the holder two
grub screws M2.5 were also used. The rubbery part of the holder has
a truncated cone shape to guarantee fluidic sealing and to avoid incorrect
positioning of the biosensors inside the microfluidic channel. In
fact, initial attempts using a cylindrical shape rubber part lead
to incorrect mounting of the biosensor holder into the microfluidic
chip due to XY expansion of the rubber when compressed.

Calibration
and Characterization Studies
Glucose and
lactate biosensors were both held at a constant potential of +0.7
V vs Ag|AgCl. The biosensors were calibrated inside the microfluidic
chip using a calibration board, consisting of two LabSmith 20 μL
programmable syringe pumps, one containing T1 perfusion solution and
one containing a glucose/lactate standard. By mixing the flows, a
multipoint calibration was carried out by varying the relative flow
rates of the two pumps, while keeping the overall flow rate constant
at 1 μL/min. This system was also used to measure the time response
of the biosensors in the microfluidic chip, by switching between the
two solutions and measuring the time taken for the sensors to reach
a steady current. In vitro microdialysis experiments
were conducted using an expired microdialysis probe (CMA70, MDialysis,
10 mm membrane length, 20 kDa molecular-weight cutoff), perfused with
T1 solution (2.3 mM calcium chloride, 147 mM sodium chloride, and
4 mM potassium chloride) at 1 μL/min using a microdialysis pump
(CMA107, MDialysis).

Cycling Protocol
For in
vivo microdialysis
experiments, all procedures were approved by the local ethics committee
(NRES 10/H0808/124, protocol CRO1608), and probes were inserted percutaneously
by a qualified clinician. The skin was cleaned with alcohol wipes,
and an anesthetic cream (EMLA, APP Pharmaceuticals) was applied to
the skin 45 min prior to probe insertion. An ice pack was also placed
on the skin 5 min before probe insertion, to further numb the area.
A sterile CMA63 microdialysis probe (Mdialysis, 10 mm membrane length,
20 kDa molecular-weight cutoff) was inserted subcutaneously, using
the tunnelling needle and introducer supplied, and secured in place
with 3M single coated conformable incise medical tape. The probe was
perfused with sterile T1 perfusion solution (MDialysis) at 1 μL/min
using a microdialysis pump (CMA107, MDialysis). Prior to beginning
exercise, baseline dialysate levels of glucose and lactate were measured.
The cycling protocol consisted of 3 levels of increasing intensity,
followed by a 1 min sprint, and finally a warm-down phase, as shown
in Figure 4-A. Dialysate glucose and lactate
levels were also recorded during the recovery phase immediately after
exercise.

Cycling trials were performed using a Wattbike (Wattbike,
UK),
that allows recording of pedal cadence (rpm) and heart rate using
a wireless chest belt (Sunto dual chest belt). Data was despiked,39 and the time delay between the microdialysis
probe and the analysis system removed. Current measurements were converted
into concentration values using pre-experiment calibrations.

Results
and Discussion
3D Printed Microfluidic Device
The
design of the 3D
printed microfluidic device was driven by the need to make a reliable
and simple connection between the microfluidic chip and the commercially
available microdialysis probe through the use of the probe outlet
holder (Figure 1-C item c). This simplifies
the overall device architecture, as no extra connection tubing and
adaptors are needed, additionally decreasing the overall dead volume
of the system.

The design of the microfluidic device was inspired
by the configuration used in the standard microdialysis setup (Figure 1-A), in which the microfluidic device slots into
the probe outlet holder and replaces the microvial, as shown in Figure 1-D. To achieve this, the microfluidic chip (Figure 1-C item e) was designed and printed with a unique L-shape, the vertical arm for connection purposes and the
horizontal arm for integration of the two needle biosensors. The vertical
arm of the chip presents similar geometry to the microvial. For instance,
the microfluidic inlet port was printed to incorporate the rubber
insert (Figure 1-C item d) from the microvial,
so as to take advantage of the easy and leak-free connection port.
Moreover, this design offers flexibility for the device to be used
in a diverse range of microdialysis applications, as it can be used
with all clinical microdialysis probes, since they have the same type
of outlet holder.

With regard to the horizontal section of the
microfluidic device,
a major challenge was to incorporate and secure the biosensors in
the correct position inside the microfluidic channel, preventing any
leaks. Initially, attempts were made to achieve this by threading
the needle electrode through a commercially available 1/32″
one-piece fitting (2-56 UNC) and using this to secure the electrode
in place inside the microfluidic chip.30 Using this approach, the device dimensions were determined by the
size of the fittings and as such were relatively large (over 1 mm).
However, integrating the biosensor in this way did not provide a good
seal with the microfluidic chip, causing leaks to occur. Erkal et
al. showed that electrodes could be successfully integrated with 3D
printed microfluidic devices using commercially available fittings;
however, due to the small size of our sensor, a 1/32″ fitting
was required. These threads were too small (2-56 UNC) to be printed
and a thread tapping tool (M2.5) was used instead. Unfortunately this
approach did not provide a satisfactory seal or good reproducibility.
To overcome the issue of the previous method, custom-made electrode
holders (Figure 1-C parts g and h) were also
designed and 3D printed, which allow better control over the electrode
placement inside the microfluidic channel.

The electrode holder
was printed using the Objet260 Connex 3D printer,
capable of printing both hard and soft plastics simultaneously on
the same component. This enabled the bottom part of the holder to
be printed using a soft and compressible plastic, ensuring a good
seal between the holder and the microfluidic device, preventing potential
leaks. The holders were designed so that the needle tip protruded
from the end and the needle was secured in place using two grub screws.
The needle position inside the holder could be varied depending on
the length of the needle, as this can change after repeated polishing
of the electrode (see supporting video 1).

This ensures that the needle tip is at a fixed distance
from the
end of the holder and hence in the correct position inside the microfluidic
channel. The microfluidic platform was designed so that the holder
could be guided into position; two pegs on the sides of the electrode
holder inserted into guiding slots and locked into place, positioning
the needle tip precisely inside the channel (see supporting video 2). Moreover, to facilitate the positioning
of the electrode inside the microchannel an additional cross-sectional
cut-out of the microfluidic device was printed. Using the cut-out
component it was possible to visualize the electrode inside the channel
under a microscope and to precisely secure the sensors inside the
holders so that the tip of the biosensor was at the desired height
inside the microchannel (Figure S2).

The use of 3D printing for fabrication of the device enabled a
modular approach to be adopted, designing separate parts to be integrated
together. Using this method each part of the device could be designed
and optimized iteratively to meet its own individual requirements.

plastic to ensure the holder makes a good seal with the microfluidic

Biosensor Characterization
Inside 3D Printed Microfluidic Chip
To investigate the effect
of the microfluidic channel dimensions
on the response time of the sensors, three different channel sizes
were tested, as described in the Experimental Section. Figure 2-B shows the normalized current
response of a glucose biosensor to a step change from 0 to 2 mM at
1 μL/min for the different channel sizes. In each case the sensor
was positioned in the middle of the channel. Cross sections of each
channel were measured using a microscope to determine the actual dimensions
of each of the channels. The dimensions specified in the table in
Figure 2-B refer to the measured dimensions.

Both glucose and lactate biosensors without the polyurethane (PU)
outer film are fast responding (for a step change in well-stirred
beaker T90 glucose = 6.6 ± 3.9 s
(n = 24), lactate = 5.1 ± 2.6 s (n = 30), data not shown). Addition of the PU film to extend the dynamic
range (necessary for lactate biosensor) slows both sensors (as shown
in Figure 2-A) and increases the variability
in response as the PU thickness is difficult to control (for a step
change T90 glucose = 36.1 ± 19.6
s (n = 5), lactate = 22.8 ± 11.3 s (n = 21)). The same biosensor shows good reproducibility.
For example, the sensors in Figure 2-A have T90 glucose = 21.0 ± 0.6 s (n = 3) and lactate = 26.1 ± 1.4 s (n = 3). Laminar
flow inside the connection tubing and microfluidic channel leads to
broadening of the concentration change, due to Taylor dispersion.28 In Figure 2-B we show
that the time response of the sensor to a step change is reduced by
decreasing the channel cross-sectional area. The T90 values are summarized in Table 1 and are generally inversely proportional to cross-sectional area
and hence proportional to linear flow rate. In the channel, glucose
values are longer than lactate ones because the glucose biosensor
was second in line and hence exposed to a greater channel volume.
The fastest response time was observed in channel 1; therefore, these
dimensions were chosen for the final device.

The horizontal
section of the microfluidic chip is similar to the
microfluidic device described by Erkal et al., which had an internal
volume of 3.90 μL. Our microfluidic chip is broadly similar,
but the internal volume up until the first biosensor is approximately
1.91 μL based on measured dimensions.

Metabolite levels
in tissue vary between people and depend on a
person’s metabolism and fitness during exercise, as well as
on the particular tissue being sampled.40 The system was calibrated online from 0 to 10 mM, at 1 μL/min
to verify that it is capable of detecting physiologically relevant
concentrations of glucose and lactate levels in the dialysate. Figure 3 shows typical current response vs concentration
for the biosensors when placed in the microfluidic device. These data
indicate that the biosensing system has good sensitivity to glucose
and lactate, with clear current changes corresponding to increasing
levels of substrate. The biosensors show a good dynamic range, suitable
for physiological monitoring. The fact that sensitivities are similar
for the glucose and lactate sensors (Figure 3) reflects the mass-transport limiting effects of the PU membrane.

As a further validation test, it was important to test the microfluidic
device with a microdialysis probe in vitro. To mimic
changes occurring in the tissue, the microdialysis probe was placed
in a well-stirred beaker and subjected to changes in beaker lactate
and glucose concentrations. The outlet holder of the microdialysis
probe was connected to the microfluidic device, which continuously
measured the glucose and lactate levels of the dialysate.

Figure 2 A. Normalized

and lactate (green) biosensor in a stirred beaker to a 2 mM concentration
step (purple arrow). B. The graph shows the normalized current for
a glucose biosensor to a step change from 0 to 2 mM at 1 μL/min
in three different microfluidic channels. The measured channel sizes
are shown in the table inset. The response time increases as the channel
dimension increases.

As the biosensors are
placed consecutively in the microfluidic
chip, there is a 2 min delay between the lactate and glucose responses
to the dialysate changes. There is also an additional delay to take
into account between the changes occurring at the probe membrane and
the analysis system due to the length of outlet tubing. Taking both
factors into consideration, the total delay was found to be 13 min
for the lactate biosensor, which was placed first in the direction
of flow and 15 min for the glucose biosensor, which was placed second
in the direction of flow. This delay is largely caused by the commercially
available probe outlet tubing and, therefore, could be reduced further
still if the extension on the probe outlet was shortened. Nevertheless,
the delay time of the microfluidic device described here was substantially
improved compared to our PDMS-based microfluidic device, which had
a lag time of 25 min using the same flow rate (1 μL/min).

Online Subcutaneous Glucose and Lactate Measurement during Cycling
Trials
In a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the potential
of this device for continuous monitoring applications the 3D printed
microfluidic chip, housing glucose and lactate needle biosensors,
was tested as a wearable device for online measurement of subcutaneous
metabolite levels during cycling training in two cyclists.

Following
probe insertion, the microfluidic device was connected to the probe
outlet holder and secured to the lower back, as shown in Figure 4-A. The biosensors were connected to an in-house
wireless potentiostat, housed inside a saddlebag attached to the bike
seat. The wireless potentiostat used was relatively large (10.5 ×
6.0 × 5.0 cm L × W × H) compared to the microfluidic
device and is not yet small enough to be integrated into a fully wearable
system. Current research within our groups is aimed at miniaturization
of this device.

and lactate
biosensors in the microfluidic device at 1 μL/min. Mean ±
standard deviation of measurement shown (n = 4).
Points fitted with the Michaelis–Menten equation. Inset: Raw
data for a typical 5-point lactate calibration from 0 to 4 mM in 1
mM steps.

A schematic of the cycling protocol
is shown in Figure 4-B.
Baseline glucose and lactate
levels were measured in the dialysate, following probe insertion,
prior to exercise. The exercise phase consisted of three levels of
increasing intensity, followed by a short sprint and a period of warming
down. Finally, dialysate glucose and lactate levels were monitored
during the recovery period following exercise.

Initial levels
after probe insertion were variable due to the trauma
of insertion. Therefore, baseline levels were monitored for at least
30 min to allow time for the tissue to stabilize following probe insertion;
typically this occurred 12 min after insertion.21

Results obtained from one of the cyclists during
the exercise phase
of the cycling protocol are presented in Figure 4-C, together with data recorded using the exercise bicycle, showing
heart rate and rotations per minute (rpm), to quantify the exercise
intensity. Initially, during phases ii and iii the heart rate signal was noisy as there was insufficient
sweat to ensure good contact between the skin and the wireless chest
belt electrodes. Prior to starting exercise, baseline glucose and
lactate levels in the dialysate were 6.02 ± 1.08 mM and 1.81
± 0.33 mM, respectively (mean ± standard deviation over
30 s time period). Measured subcutaneous glucose levels decreased
with increasing exercise intensity, and local levels were driven down
further still following exercise, even after 50 min of rest. In contrast,
lactate levels increased with increasing exercise intensity, peaking
immediately after the sprint, and gradually decreased once cycling
had stopped. After 50 min of resting, dialysate glucose and lactate
levels were 1.84 ± 0.05 mM and 1.67 ± 0.03 mM, respectively.

To guard against possible changes in probe recovery, a ratio of
the two metabolites was also calculated. The lactate/glucose ratio
increased with exercise and rose more steeply with increasing cycling
intensity. Interestingly, the lactate/glucose ratio continued to increase
considerably, even after exercise had stopped.

An overview of
the dialysate glucose and lactate levels and the
lactate/glucose ratio throughout the cycling protocol for two cyclists
is shown in Figure 4-D. The overall trends
in glucose and lactate levels are similar for the two cyclists, although
the absolute concentrations appear quite different. This variability
could be caused by changes in probe recovery or by differences in
the fitness levels of the cyclists. In principle, level changes caused
by differences in probe recovery would have been removed using ratios
of analyte concentrations, such as the lactate/glucose ratio.16 Such ratios are widely used for monitoring in
the injured human brain (lactate/pyruvate)41 and in muscle (lactate/pyruvate and lactate/glucose),42 though this needs to be further investigated
for subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, there are clear differences
in the lactate/glucose ratio trend for the two cyclists.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated the first example of a 3D printed microfluidic
device with integrated removable biosensors that joins directly to
a clinical microdialysis probe for continuous human monitoring applications.
Here we have demonstrated its capabilities as a wearable device for
subcutaneous monitoring of tissue glucose and lactate levels in cyclists
during exercise. The clear changes recorded in the local glucose and
lactate levels indicate that this device could have huge potential
for monitoring and evaluating athlete training effectiveness in real-time.
Moreover, this miniaturized device also has potential for clinical
microdialysis applications, such as bedside monitoring, as its wearable
nature removes the need for long connection tubing, which usually
leads to long lag times. Due to the dimensional control provided by
3D printing, it was possible to design the microfluidic device so
that it could easily be integrated with commercially available microdialysis
probes, making it suitable for numerous potential applications. Future
work will focus on miniaturization of the wireless potentiostats to
enable integration of the electronics within the wearable device.
Due to the modular nature of the device, the platform can be expanded
to include monitoring of other clinically relevant biomarkers, offering
promise in a wide range of clinical and fitness applications.

Figure 4 A. Photograph
of microfluidic device to measure tissue glucose
and lactate levels in dialysate during the cycling protocol. Dialysate
flowed into the microfluidic chip, housing the glucose and lactate
biosensors, which were connected to wireless potentiostats, secured
onto the bike. B. Experimental protocol. Tissue levels were monitored
during an initial resting period (i), followed by
cycling at 4 levels of increasing rpm (ii-v), a level
of warming down (vi), and a final period of resting
(vii). C. Dialysate glucose and lactate levels during
the exercise phase of the cycling protocol. The bottom graph shows
the glucose (red) and lactate (green) levels, the middle graph (black)
shows the lactate/glucose ratio, and the top graph shows the rotations
per minute (blue) and heart rate (purple) throughout the cycling protocol.
Glucose and lactate traces have been despiked.39 The dotted lines indicate the stages of varying cycling
intensity: (ii) 55 rpm, (iii) 65
rpm, (iv) 75 rpm, (v) sprint, and
(vi) 55 rpm. Data has been time-aligned, taking into
account the time delay of the system. D. Histograms showing mean dialysate
levels for two different cyclists during key points in cycling protocol.
Labels correspond to stages described in the experimental protocol:
(i) baseline (ii) midway through
warm up, (iii) midway through medium intensity, (iv) midway through high intensity, (v) end of sprint, (vi) end of warm down, and (vii) after 50
min of recovery.
