The irreproducibility
of the standard potential (E°) is probably the
last major challenge for the commercialization
of solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SCISEs) as single-use or
wearable sensors. To overcome this issue, we are introducing for the
first time a perfluorinated alkanoate side chain functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOTF) as a hydrophobic SC in potassium-selective electrodes (K-SCISEs)
based on plasticized poly(vinyl chloride). The SC incorporates the
tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TFAB–) anion,
which is also present as a lipophilic additive in the ion-selective
membrane (ISM), thus ensuring thermodynamic reversibility at the SC/ISM
interface and improving the potential reproducibility of the electrodes.
We show here that the PEDOTF-TFAB solid contact, which was prepolarized
prior to the ISM deposition to either its half or fully conducting
form (i.e. different oxidation states) in acetonitrile containing
0.01 M KTFAB, had a very stable open-circuit potential and an outstanding
potential reproducibility of only ±0.5 mV (n = 6) for 1 h in the same solution after the prepolarization. This
shows that the oxidation state of the highly hydrophobic PEDOTF-TFAB
film (water contact angle 133°) is stable over time and can be
precisely controlled with prepolarization. The SC was also not light
sensitive, which is normally a disadvantage of conducting polymer
SCs. After the ISM deposition, the standard deviation of the E° of the K-SCISEs prepared on glassy carbon was ±3.0
mV (n = 5), which is the same as that for conventional
liquid contact K-ISEs. This indicates that the ISM deposition is the
main source for the potential irreproducibility of the K-SCISEs, which
has been overlooked previously.

==== Body
Solid-contact
ion-selective
electrodes (SCISEs) have been the subject of intensive research. Clearly,
the replacement of the aqueous liquid contact in conventional ISEs
with a solid material is appealing not only in terms of widening their
applicability by withstanding higher pressures (deep water measurements)
or temperatures but also in terms of easier mass production and robust
miniaturization.1 The most popular ion-to-electron
transducers, i.e. solid contacts (SC), have been until now electrically
conducting polymers (ECP),2−10 different carbon materials with large capacitance,11−15 redox couples,16,17 and redox-active compunds.18 Recently various new SCs have also grown in
popularity, such as tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)19 and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and their radical salts,20 intercalation compounds (LiFePO4/FePO4),21 Prussian blue analogues,22 KBr/AgBr,23 fullerenes,24 submicron porous carbon spheres,25 gold nanoparticles,26,27 molybdenum disulfide,28 metal–organic
frameworks (MOF),29 and different types
of composite materials.30−37

Initially the main aim of the research in this field was to
develop
robust and miniaturized SCISEs that match the excellent potential
stability of the conventional ISEs with a potential drift of less
than ca. 0.1 mV h–1. However, with the increasing
interest in single-use and wearable sensors,38,39 the efforts became largely oriented toward the development of SCISEs
for calibration-free measurements. ISEs seem ideal devices in this
respect, as they follow the Nernst equation: i.e., the slope of the
linear part of the calibration curve (E vs log ai) is constant for a given analyte ion charge
and temperature. Properly designed SCISEs have slopes very close to
the ideal Nernstian slope, but their standard potentials (E°) determined at ai =
0 usually show an unacceptable large variation. Not only are the E° values difficult to predict theoretically but also
even the very same preparation method may lead to unreproducible values,
which is currently the biggest challenge hampering commercialization
of the SCISEs.

Although some very good E°
reproducibilities
have been reported, it is still problematic to objectively compare
these values due to the lack of a standardized test protocol for the E° determination. The SCISEs may have been exposed
to conditioning or measurements for different long periods before
the standard deviation (SD) of E° was determined.
While a divergence in time of the E° values
is the most common, there are also examples of the opposite. For example,
K+-selective SCISEs (K-SCISEs) with the SC composed of
polyaniline dispersed in a plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) ion-selective
membrane (PVC-ISM) had an initial E° reproducibility
of ±17.9 mV (n = 3) after 1 day but improved
to only ±1.9 mV after 57 days of exposure to 0.1 M KCl.6 Until now, the highest E°
reproducibility of ±0.1 mV (n = 5) has been
obtained by Paczosa-Bator for K-SCISEs, which were prepared with a
relatively complex SC consisting of highly porous graphene, carbon
black, and a fluorinated acrylic copolymer. The SC lacks a redox couple
and therefore a well-defined interfacial charge transfer mechanism.33 A slightly lower E° reproducibility
of ±0.3 mV (n = 5) was reported for a nitrate-selective
SCISE prepared with the TTF/TTF+ redox couple and graphene
as the nanocomposite SC.31

Redox
couples/materials soon emerged as the most promising approaches
to theoretically adjust the E° value of the
SCISEs by the simplicity of varying the ratio of the redox components.
Indeed, the pioneering work of Zou et al. incorporating a redox couple
consisting of the Co(II) and Co(III) complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline
in the PVC-ISM proved to be beneficial in obtaining a high initial E° reproducibility of ±0.7 mV (n = 5) for K-SCISEs.17 However, the reproducibility
deteriorated to ±16.3 mV already after 24 h due to leaching of
the redox compound(s) to the aqueous phase, showing that this concept
still needs to be technically improved. Using a similar approach that
was introduced by Jaworska et al.,35 a E° reproducibility of only ±0.2 mV (n = 3) was achieved by incorporating two organometallic complexes
of Co(II) and Co(III) (not a redox couple) into the ISM.18 In another innovative concept by Ishige et al.,
the LiFePO4/FePO4 redox couple (intercalation
compounds) was used as the SC in Li+-selective SCISEs,
resulting in a good E° reproducibility of ±2.0
mV (n = 3).21

Electrically
conducting polymers usually have a rather broad distribution
of redox states, and therefore the E° (SD) of
the ECP-based SCISEs is usually ca. ±10–20 mV or even
higher.40 However, their E° reproducibility can be efficiently improved by prepolarization
of the ECP-SC before the deposition of the PVC-ISM on top of it,8,9,41,42 by short-circuiting the SCISEs to a reference electrode (RE),40 or by applying a potential or a current pulse
in the nA range to the electrodes.43 The
prepolarization is undeniably the simplest and quickest method of
adjusting the conducting state of the ECPs, which we found essential
in obtaining a good E° reproducibility for K-SCISEs
in our previous studies.8,9 It is crucial that the
ECP is prepolarized to its half or fully conducting form to ensure
thermodynamic reversibility at the SC/ISM interface. In addition,
it is equally important that the ECP is hydrophobic enough to prevent
the formation of the detrimental aqueous layer at the SC/ISM interface
that results in response instability. This is normally not the case,
because the ECP backbone is positively charged in its conducting form,
making it relatively hydrophilic.

To overcome this limitation,
we have shown recently that the incorporation
of a highly hydrophobic anion such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)
in the polypyrrole (PPy) matrix makes the ECP very hydrophobic in
its conducting form (water contact angle (WCA): 97 ± 5°).
K-SCISEs based on such prepolarized SCs had a very good E° reproducibility of ±0.7 mV (n = 4) and
a very low potential drift of only 69 μV h–1 during the test period of 46 days, after which they still had a
good E° reproducibility of ±3.1 mV. Other
studies,31,33 including that of Guzinski et al. using
PEDOT-C14 as the SC,10 seem
to conclusively support the need for highly hydrophobic SCs as one
of the main prerequisites for obtaining stable and reproducible electrode
potentials. Despite the good E° reproducibility
of the K-SCISEs based on PPy-PFOS, we observed in interlaboratory
studies that it was challenging to get a very good E° reproducibility with a larger number of SCISEs.

We have
therefore conducted a systematic study to understand the
reasons for the E° irreproducibility of K-SCISEs
having poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as the SC. For the
first time a highly hydrophobic perfluorinated alkanoate side chain
functionalized PEDOT44,45 (PEDOTF) has been applied as
the SC. It incorporates the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate anion
(TFAB–) in its structure to enhance the hydrophobicity
of the conducting form of the ECP-SC. To further optimize the SCISE
design, we have also added TFAB– to the ISM as a
lipophilic cation exchanger, which we expect will result in a well-defined
and reproducible phase boundary potential at the SC/ISM interface.
The results presented in this work show that the deposition of the
PVC-ISM on the SC is the main source causing the potential irreproducibility
of the K-SCISEs, which has been overlooked previously.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
As described in the Supporting Information, fluorinated 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene with a
perfluorooctanyl side chain (EDOTF) was custom-synthesized from hydroxymethyl
EDOT (95%) and pentadecafluorooctanoyl chloride (97%) obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. High-molecular-weight PVC (HMW PVC), bis(2-ethylhexyl)
sebacate (DOS), potassium ionophore I (valinomycin), and tetrahydrofuran
(THF), all Selectophore grade, and anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN; 99.5%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. KTFAB (97%; Figure S-1) was obtained from Alfa Aesar, and KCl (99.999%,
Suprapur grade) was received from Merck Millipore. All aqueous solutions
were prepared from deionized water (DIW) with a resistivity of 18.2
MΩ cm (ELGA).

Electropolymerization of EDOTF and Prepolarization
of the PEDOTF-SCs
The electropolymerization (EP) of EDOTF
was done galvanostatically
at 0.5 mA cm–2 to 0.5 C cm–2 (controlled
by a Autolab PGSTAT potentiostat) in freshly made ACN solutions of
0.01 M EDOTF and 0.01 M KTFAB. A three-electrode setup was used, where
a glassy-carbon (GC) or gold electrode (d = 1.6 mm;
incorporated in a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) body with an outer
diameter of 6.0 mm; Bio-Logic Science Instruments), a Pt wire, and
a Ag wire served as working (WE), counter, and pseudo-RE, respectively.
The WE was polished prior to the EP with a 0.05 μm alumina suspension,
rinsed thoroughly with ethanol and DIW followed by ultrasonication
for 5 min in DIW, and finally rinsed again with ethanol and DIW. The
electropolymerization solution was first purged with N2 for 15 min immediately before use and then blanketed during the
polymerization. After the EP, the PEDOTF-TFAB films were rinsed with
ACN and prepolarized in deaerated 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN at either 0.22
or 0.40 V for 5 min using the same three-electrode setup as above.
Finally, the PEDOTF-SCs were rinsed with either ACN or THF, as explained
in the Results and Discussion, before they
were allowed to dry for ca. 10 min in ambient air prior to the drop-casting
of the PVC-ISM on top of the PEDOTF-SC. Some of the PEDOT-TFAB films
were also characterized after the EP with cyclic voltammetry (CV)
in the potential range of −0.5 V to +0.7 V in deaerated 0.01
M KTFAB-ACN with scan rates (ν) of 5, 10, and 20 mV s–1 using the same three-electrode setup as above. All electrode potentials
in this work related to the electropolymerization of EDOTF, prepolarization,
and characterizations of the PEDOTF-SCs refer to the Ag wire acting
as a pseudoreference electrode.

K+-Selective
SCISE Fabrication
The ISM had
the following composition: 32.9% (w/w) HMW PVC, 65.7% DOS, 1.06% valinomycin,
and 0.34% KTFAB. The components were dissolved in 1 mL of THF to produce
a solution with 20% dry weight. A 40 μL portion of the ISM cocktail
solution was deposited by drop-casting onto the PEDOTF-SCs in two
consecutive steps (2 × 20 μL), and the PVC-ISMs with a
thickness of ca. 220 μm were allowed to dry overnight in ambient
air. We compared the initial potential stability and E° reproducibility of the K-SCISE with those of their conventional
liquid contact counterparts having the same ISM composition. The latter
were prepared by pouring 1.5 mL of an ISM cocktail (10% w/w in THF)
into a glass ring (d = 24.4 mm) fixed on a glass
plate. The PVC-ISM was allowed to dry overnight before circular membranes
with a diameter of 7 mm were punched (thickness ca. 200 μm)
out of it and mounted into conventional Philips IS 561 electrode bodies
(Möller Glasbläserei, Zürich, Switzerland) with
0.01 M KCl as the inner filling solution.

Potentiometric Measurements
We used a 16-channel high
input impedance voltmeter (1015 Ω, Lawson Laboratories,
Malvern, PA, USA) in all potentiometric measurements. The potential
stability of the PEDOTF-SCs was determined in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN for
1 h, whereas the initial potential stabilities of the K-SCISEs were
measured in 0.01 M KCl for 24 h. The K-SCISEs were calibrated from
10–1 to 10–9 M KCl, and the potential
readings at every concentration were taken after 5 min in quiescent
solutions. In all aqueous solutions, we used a double-junction Ag/AgCl/3
M KCl//1 M LiOAc as the RE (No. 6.0729.100, Metrohm AG). The potentiometric
aqueous layer test was done with fully conditioned SCISEs by changing
the solution from 0.1 M KCl to 0.1 M NaCl (24 h) and then back to
0.1 M KCl (24 h). The light sensitivity of the PEDOT-SC (without ISM)
was measured in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN by keeping the electrodes first in
room light (10 min) and then exposing them to complete darkness (10
min) and finally to intense cold light (10 min, >1.6 × 105 lx; Leica CLS 150XE light source41).

Water Contact Angles and SEM Measurements
Water droplets
were placed on PEDOTF-TFAB films (d = 5.0 mm) that
had been prepolarized to −0.50, 0.20, and 0.50 V. We recorded
images of the water droplets with a Dyno-Lite USB digital microscope
and determined the WCAs from the images with the Inkscape 0.92.3 software.
We measured the surface morphology and the film thickness of the PEDOTF-SC
prepared on a Pt-sputtered ZnSe refection element (see below) with
the LEO1530 Gemini FEGSEM instrument.

Water Uptake of the PEDOTF-SC
We measured the diffusion
of water in the ca. 1.8 μm thick PEDOTF-SC with the FTIR-ATR
technique for 24 h in 0.01 M KCl. The film was deposited by electropolymerization
on the Pt-sputtered ZnSe reflection element. Prior to the water uptake
measurements, we prepolarized the SC to its fully conducting form
(positively charged) at 0.40 V for 5 min to maximize its water uptake.
The experimental details of the water uptake measurements are given
in the Supporting Information. The experimental
setup and the modeling of the water diffusion coefficients have been
thoroughly described in detail elsewhere.9,46

Results and Discussion
We report here for the first time
the electropolymerization of
EDOTF with the TFAB– anion as the charge-compensating
counterion on GC and gold (Au) substrates. Figure S-2 shows the CVs recorded during the electropolymerization
of 0.01 M EDOTF in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN on GC in the potential range of
−0.9 to +1.5 V. They reveal that the polymerization of EDOTF
starts at ca. 1.3 V, and the increasing anodic and cathodic currents
confirm that the film grows in thickness during each potential cycle.
However, we found that the PEDOTF film growth was not fully reproducible
with CV and the PEDOT-SC film thickness could not therefore be controlled
precisely. Some GC electrodes required a higher anodic end potential
for the film formation, which may be due to slightly different surface
properties of the commercial GC-PEEK electrodes used in this study.
This assumption is supported by comparing the anodic and cathodic
peak potentials (Epa, Epc) given by the electrode manufacturer for the 12 GC-PEEK
electrodes that were used in this study. The manufacturer had measured
the Epa and Epc after the electrode fabrication in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 with 1.0 M KNO3 as the background electrolyte.
The comparison shows that the Epa varied
between 237 and 295 mV for the 12 GC-PEEK electrodes that were supposed
to be identical (electrodes 1–9, 289 ± 4 mV; electrodes
10–12, 238 ± 1 mV). The corresponding Epc values were 162–225 mV (electrodes 1–9,
220 ± 6 mV; electrodes 10–12, 163 ± 1 mV), and the
peak separation (ΔEp = Epa – Epc) was 64–75
mV. It is known that the electron transfer for GC is affected by surface
functional groups (carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl), and their surface
concentration can be influenced if the electrodes are polished in
the presence of water.47 Moreover, adsorption
of organic contaminants from ultrapure water and ambient air has been
identified to lower the electroactivity of a highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite surface, which can also affect the electroactivity of GC.48

We decided therefore to perform the electropolymerization
galvanostatically
with a constant current of 0.5 mA cm–2, which allowed
us to better control the charge consumed during the electropolymerization
(0.5 C cm–2) and ensure that all PEDOTF-SCs had
the same thickness (i.e. redox capacitance). To minimize the variation
of the initial surface state of the individual electrodes, we polished
them repeatedly until they had ΔEp = 75 mV when the GC-PEEK electrodes were characterized by CV in
2 mM K4Fe(CN)6 with 1.0 M KNO3 as
the background electrolyte (ν = 5 mV s–1; Figure S-3). After the CV characterization, the Epa and Epc values
of the electrodes were typically 292–294 and 215–217
mV, respectively. To further improve the reproducibility of the electropolymerization,
the PEDOTF-TFAB electrodes were individually electropolymerized from
fresh monomer solutions (V = 3 mL, Figure S-4). The formed PEDOTF-SCs were characterized by CV
in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN in the potential range of −0.5 to +0.5
V (Figure 1). The CVs
show that the PEDOTF film converts to the electrically conducting
form at E > −0.20 V. At ν = 5 mV
s–1, the Epa and Epc values were 0.32 and 0.13 V, respectively,
but shifted to 0.42 and 0.02 V for ν = 20 mV s–1, indicating that the electrode transfer becomes slightly more sluggish
at higher scan rates.

Figure 1 CVs of the PEDOTF-SC in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN measured with
the scan
rates of 5, 10, and 20 mV s–1. The insets show the
WCAs of the PEDOTF-SC that was polarized to −0.50, 0.20, and
0.50 V in same electrolyte solution (vs a Ag wire).

SEM images (Figure S-5) revealed that
the PEDOT-TFAB film has a uniform surface morphology and a relatively
open surface structure with sharper polymer bundles pointing out from
the surface, which are expected to further lower the wettability of
the hydrophobic polymer film. To confirm this, we performed WCA measurements
on PEDOTF-SCs prepolarized to −0.5 V (nonconducting form),
0.20 V (half conducting form), and 0.5 V (fully conducting form) in
0.01 M KTFAB-ACN. In agreement with our expectations, the WCA of PEDOTF
was ca. 131–133° irrespective of its conducting state
(insets in Figure 1), proving that both the half and fully conducting forms are highly
hydrophobic, which is crucial for preventing the detrimental aqueous
layer formation beneath the ISM causing potential instability of the
SCISEs. The WCAs reported here are slightly lower than those measured
by Luo et al. for a PEDOTF film prepared with a constant potential
of 1.4 V at 0 °C (131.9–150.5°)45 but are in very good accordance with the WCA of PEDOT-C14 (136 ± 5°) and higher than those for polyazulene
doped with PF6– (PAz-PF6;
126 ± 14°),42 chemically prepared
polyoctylthiophene (POT; ca. 110°),49 and PPy-PFOS (97 ± 5°).10

The high hydrophobicity of the PEDOTF-SC film was confirmed by
measuring the water diffusion through the film with the FTIR-ATR technique46,50−52 when it was placed in contact with 0.01 M KCl solution
(Figure 2). In evaluating
the FTIR spectra, it must be kept in mind that this technique is very
sensitive and is able to detect traces of water, in contrast to the
potentiometric aqueous layer test.53 The
spectra in the wavenumber region of ca. 3000–3700 cm–1 (OH stretching) reveal that minor amounts of water have diffused
through the PEDOTF-SC to the vicinity of the SC/ZnSe interface already
after 5 min when the SC is fully exposed to water. The amount of water
increases very slowly during the whole measurement until a saturation
level is reached after ca. 20 h. It is expected that some water diffusion
will always take place in all types of (slightly) porous SCs, showing
the challenge in completely blocking the water diffusion. Mathematical
modeling of the water uptake showed that it can be described with
three diffusion coefficients, D1 = 6.6
× 10–11 cm2 s–1, D2 = 1.9 × 10–12 cm2 s–1, and D3 = 2.8 × 10–13 cm2 s–1, indicating that the water diffusion in the PEDOTF-SC
is slightly higher than in the PPy-PFOS solid contact9 but lower than in the POT-SC.51 However, as the surface of most conducting polymers is relatively
uneven, it is difficult to determine the film thickness with the highest
precision, adding some uncertainty to the reported water diffusion
coefficients.

Figure 2 Water uptake of the bare PEDOTF-SC measured after 0, 1,
5, 10,
and 15 min and 1, 5, 10, 20, and 24 h in contact with 0.01 M KCl.
The SC was polarized in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN at 0.40 V (vs a Ag wire)
prior to the water uptake measurement. Gain factor: 128.

The SC should preferably have a relatively high
capacitance to
provide the SCISEs with a stable potential.4 Electrochemical impedance measurements showed that the redox capacitance
of the PEDOTF-SC was ca. 40 mF cm–2 (Figure S-6). This is sufficiently high for the
PEDOTF-SC to act as very efficient redox buffer and ion-to-electron
transducer in the K-SCISEs. The capacitance is considerably higher
than for PEDOT prepared with polystyrenesulfonate (15 mF cm–2),54 similar to that for PAz-PF6 (45 mF cm–2),42 and
much lower than that for a composite consisting of polyaniline and
reduced graphene oxide (77 mF cm–2).55 All transducers were prepared with the same
charge as for the PEDOTF-SC.

The lipophilic TFAB– anion is present both in
the PVC-ISM and in the PEDOTF-SC to ensure thermodynamic reversibility
at the SC/ISM interface. We measured therefore the potentiometric
response of the SC in 10–4–10–2 M KTFAB-ACN and in aqueous 10–4–10–1 M KCl solutions to determine if the PEDOTF-SC exchange
anions or cations. We found that the SC had a super-Nernstian anionic
response in KTFAB-ACN solutions, revealing that it is exchanging TFAB– anions when the SC is in contact with an organic phase:
i.e., the PVC-ISM. In KCl solutions, we observed a sub-Nernstian K+ response indicating that the highly hydrophobic TFAB– anion cannot leave the SC and enter the aqueous phase.
We can therefore conclude that the PEDOT-SC exchanges TFAB– anions when it functions as an ion-to-electron transducer beneath
the K+-selective PVC-ISM, which we expect will improve
the potential reproducibility of the electrodes. However, we can speculate
that a certain degree of K+ exchange may also occur in
the presence of small amounts of water at the SC/ISM interface.

The light sensitivity can be a drawback for most ECPs, especially
POT,41 although many ECPs that we have
used as SCs in SCISEs, such as PPy-PFOS9 and PAz-PF6,8 are completely
light insensitive beneath the ISM. We therefore measured the potential
response of only the bare PEDOTF-SC in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN (to exclude
the influence of the ISM) when the SC was exposed to room light, complete
darkness, and intense cold light (Figure 3). We did not observe any light sensitivity
of the bare PEDOTF-SC, thus making it a most suitable SC material
for SCISEs. The light sensitivity test was restricted to 30 min due
to the high volatility of ACN, which is the reason for the slow potential
drift observed in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Light sensitivity of the PEDOTF-SCs (n = 3) measured
in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN by exposing it to room light, darkness, and intense
cold light (>1.6 × 105 lx). The SC was prepolarized
to 0.40 V (vs a Ag wire) in the same electrolyte solution before starting
the measurement. The minor potential drift is due to the evaporation
of ACN from the solution.

To identify what causes the E° irreproducibility
of the K-SCISEs, we started by measuring the potential stability of
the bare PEDOTF-SC before the ISM was deposited on top of it by drop-casting.
The PEDOTF-SC was first prepolarized to 0.22 V for 5 min in 0.01 M
KTFAB-ACN, and after that, its open-circuit potential stability and
reproducibility were measured in the same electrolyte solution for
1 h (Figure 4). The
PEDOTF-SCs showed an outstanding potential stability and a potential
reproducibility (given as the SD) of ±0.5 mV (n = 6) during the whole test period. This shows that it is possible
to adjust the conducting state of the PEDOTF-SC to a desired level
that is very stable over time. The measurement proved also that differences
in the initial surface conditions of the GC substrates do not influence
the potential reproducibility of the prepolarized SCs, and we can
therefore exclude that they cause the E° irreproducibility
of the SCISEs.

Figure 4 Potential stability and reproducibility of the PEDOTF-SC
(n = 6) measured in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN for 1 h after
polarization
in the same solution to 0.22 V (vs a Ag wire) for 5 min.

Since the PEDOTF-SC will be in contact with THF
during the drop-casting
of the PVC-ISM on top of it, we studied also how the potential reproducibility
was influenced by keeping the SC in contact with a pure stirred THF
solution for different long times up to 30 min. After the SC was kept
in pure THF solution for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, or 30 min, its
potential reproducibility was determined at the open-circuit potential
in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Potential reproducibility (given as SD) of the PEDOTF-SC (n = 6) measured in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN after different exposure
times to stirred (■) THF and (●) ACN. We ensured that
the SC had the same initial oxidation state (i.e. conducting form)
in all measurements by polarizing it to 0.22 V (vs a Ag wire) in 0.01
M KTFAB-ACN for 5 min before each measurement.

We compared the potential reproducibilities obtained after
the
THF treatment with a PEDOTF-SC that had been exposed to pure ACN in
an identical measuring sequence. This was done because the SC is rinsed
with pure ACN after the prepolarization in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN and it
can possibly influence its doping level (i.e. oxidation state) due
to leaching of TFAB– anions into the organic solvent. Figure 5 shows that the contact
time with THF does not influence the potential reproducibility to
any significant extent, especially for t ≤
5 min (SD < 1.0 mV). Even for greater exposure times there is no
clearly observed trend, and since the potential reproducibility is
still ±0.6 mV after the contact time of 30 min with THF, which
is the same as for t = 0.25 min, it is unlikely that
THF will affect the potential of the PEDOTF-SC during the drop-casting
and overnight drying of the PVC-ISM. However, we found that a contact
time longer than 5 min with ACN had a negative effect on the potential
reproducibility. Hence, the PEDOT-SC should be rinsed only briefly
to remove residues of the KTFAB electrolyte salt from its surface.
In another experiment described in Figure S-7, we show that is essential to rinse the SC with ACN after the prepolarization
to avoid severe deterioration of the detection limit (LOD) and selectivity
coefficients of the K-SCISEs.

We fabricated the K-SCISEs on
GC and Au substrates to study how
the substrate material influences the initial potential stability
and reproducibility of the electrodes (Figure 6 and Figure S-8). The PEDOTF-SCs were prepolarized either to the half-conducting
form (0.22 V) or fully conducting form (0.40 V) in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN.
They were then kept in a stirred ACN solution for 30 s to wash off
KTFAB residues from the SC surface. We let the SCs dry in ambient
air for ca. 10 min prior to the deposition of the PVC-ISM by drop-casting.

Figure 6 Initial
potential stability and reproducibility of (1) conventional
liquid contact K-ISEs (n = 5) and K-SCISEs prepared
with the PEDOTF-SC prepolarized to (2) 0.22 V (n =
4) and (3) 0.40 V (n = 5) in 0.01 M KTFAB-ACN (vs
a Ag wire). The SCISEs were fabricated on GC, and the measurements
were carried out for 24 h in 0.01 M KCl. The potentials of the conventional
ISEs have been shifted with 370 mV to higher potentials.

When the SCISEs were in contact with 0.01 M KCl
solution for the
first time, the potential of the K-SCISEs prepared on GC substrates
stabilized quickly within ca. 3–5 min independent of the prepolarization
potential of the PEDOTF-SC (Figure 6), which is only slightly longer than that for the
conventional liquid contact K-ISEs (ca. 2 min). We obtained the same
stabilization time of 3–5 min for the SCISEs prepared on Au
substrates with the PEDOTF-SC prepolarized to 0.22 V, while the electrodes
prepolarized to 0.40 V had a considerably longer stabilization time
of ca. 20 min (Figure S-8).

In Table 1, we have
summarized the potential drifts and potential reproducibilities (SD)
of the K-SCISEs and conventional liquid contact K-ISEs measured during
the initial potential stability measurement. The SCISEs prepared on
the GC substrates had a slightly better potential reproducibility,
especially after 24 h in contact with 0.01 KCl, than the SCISEs having
Au as the substrate material. Among all electrodes, the K-SCISEs prepared
on GC and prepolarized at 0.40 V had the best potential reproducibility
of only ±3.3 mV at the beginning of the test (t = 0 h) and ±2.7 mV after 24 h. This is practically the same
as for the conventional K-ISEs, which showed ±2.1 and ±2.9
mV at the beginning of the test and after 24 h, respectively. This
indicates that the prepolarized K-SCISEs have response characteristics
that are equal to those of the conventional K-ISEs. It also shows
that the prepolarization of the SC is essential to obtain electrodes
with high E° reproducibility. We demonstrate
this in Figure S-9 for K-SCISEs having
nonpolarized PEDOTF-SCs. The potential response of one of the SCISEs
deviates considerably (>300 mV) from the other five electrodes,
which
show a relatively good E° reproducibility of
±5.2 mV in the beginning of the initial potential stability test
(Table 1), but ±10.7
mV already after 24 h in 0.01 M KCl.

We observed
that the K-SCISEs that were prepolarized to the half
conducting form (0.22 V) had a lower initial potential drift in comparison
to the electrodes prepolarized to the fully conducting form (0.40
V). The K-SCISEs fabricated on GC and prepolarized to 0.22 V had the
lowest potential drift of only −56 ± 24 μV h–1 during the first 24 h in 0.01 M KCl, which is comparable
to the drift of the conventional K-ISEs (32 ± 47 μV h–1). The reasons for the higher drift obtained for the
K-SCISEs prepolarized at 0.40 V is still unclear. However, we speculate
that the long-term stability of the fully oxidized form of PEDOTF-SC
is lower than that for the half oxidized form (0.22 V), which has
approximately equal concentrations of conducting and nonconducting
polymer segments, thus providing the SCs with a better redox buffer
capacity: e.g., against the influence of oxygen. Figure S-10 shows that the potential of the K-SCISE prepared
on GC and prepolarized at 0.22 V was insensitive to O2 and
CO2 when these gases were purged through 0.1 M KCl for
95 and 60 min, respectively. We note also that we did not study further
the potential response characteristics of the K-SCISEs fabricated
on the Au substrates due to their slightly worse potential reproducibility
in comparison to GC.

Completely new Au and GC electrodes were
also bought for this purpose
and were compared to older GC electrodes that were purchased in 2010,
which had been in extensive use earlier. We could not find any noticeable
differences in the initial potential stability and reproducibility
between these GC electrodes and the new GC electrodes that were purchased
for this project.

In Figure 7, the
calibration curves show that the K-SCISEs prepared on GC with the
PEDOTF-SC prepolarized to the fully conducting form had in practice
the same potentiometric response as the conventional K-ISEs. The E° reproducibility (SD), slope, and LOD of the K-SCISEs
and the conventional K-ISEs were ±3.0 mV, 58.1 ± 0.6 mV
pK–1, and ca. 3 × 10–7 M
and ±3.0 mV, 57.8 ± 0.5 mV pK–1, and ca.
5 × 10–7 M, respectively (n = 5). The same E° reproducibility indicates
that inhomogeneities in the PVC-ISM may be the reason for or contribute
significantly to the potential irreproducibility of the K-SCISEs.
This may partially explain the differences in the E° reproducibilities reported in the literature. For example,
Ishige et al. have recently reported a E° reproducibility
of ±0.6 mV (n = 4) for conventional plasticized
PVC-based Li+-selective ISEs.21

Figure 7 Potentiometric
responses of (a) the K-SCISEs prepared on GC with
the PEDOTF-SC prepolarized to 0.40 V (n = 5; vs a
Ag wire) and (b) the conventional K-ISEs (n = 5)
measured in 10–9–10–1 M
KCl. The y axis scales are different for (a) and
(b).

The K-SCISEs prepolarized to the
half-conducting form had a very
low average potential drift of ca. 50 μV h–1 during 49 days, a potentiometric slope of 60.5 ± 0.1 mV pK–1 (n = 4), unchanged
LOD (1 × 10–7 M), and E°
reproducibility (±5.5 mV) at the end of the test period. This
shows that the PVC-ISM composition containing KTFAB, which was used
for the first time in this work, is suitable for long-term use. The
logarithmic selectivity coefficients of the K-SCISEs for the most
relevant interfering ions were between −4.2 and −6.7
(except NH4+; Table S-1), which is in good accordance with other K-SCISEs with a similar
PVC-ISM composition.9 The potentiometric
aqueous layer test showed no water layer formation (Figure 8), and the chronopotentiometric
measurements (Figure S-11) revealed that
the SCISEs had a very low potential change of only 1.2 ± 0.3
mV upon current polarization with ±1 nA and no observable potential
change when the current was decreased to ±100 pA. The result
of the aqueous layer test is in good accordance with the very low
water uptake of the fluorinated PEDOTF-SC measured with the very sensitive
FTIR-ATR technique. The chronopotentiometric measurements reveal that
the redox capacitance of the buried SC was 2.2 ± 0.6 mF cm–1, which is ca. 5% of the corresponding value of the
bare PEDOTF-SC. However, this redox capacitance in combination with
high hydrophobicity of the SC and the thermodynamically reversible
charge (ion) transfer at the SC/ISM interface is sufficiently high
to provide the K-SCISEs with a reproducible and stable potential.

Figure 8 Potentiometric
aqueous layer test performed with the K-SCISEs (n = 3) prepared on GC with the PEDOTF-SCs prepolarized to
0.22 V (vs a Ag wire).

Conclusions
We have fabricated K-SCISEs with the same E°
reproducibility of ±3.0 mV (n = 5) as that for
the conventional liquid contact K-ISEs by using prepolarized and highly
hydrophobic perfluorinated alkanoate side chain functionalized PEDOTF-
TFAB as the SC (WCA: 133°). The SC had an outstanding potential
reproducibility of ±0.5 mV (n = 6) before the
PVC-ISM was drop-cast on top of it. This indicates that the ISM deposition
or inhomogeneities in the ISM is the main reason for the potential
irreproducibility of the K-SCISEs. We believe this may have implications
also for SCISEs with non-ECP solid contacts. We have fabricated altogether
ca. 30 series of K-SCISEs and PEDOT-SCs, each consisting of four to
six electrodes, and we believe therefore that ±3.0 mV is the
highest E° reproducibility that can be achieved
with a higher number of K-SCISEs. They showed excellent response characteristics
with conditioning times ≤5 min, low potential drift of ca.
50 μV h–1 over 49 days, almost ideal Nernstian
slopes, no O2 and CO2 sensitivity, and no water
layer formation. In addition, the bare PEDOTF-SC had no light sensitivity.
