Tandem mass spectral libraries (MS/MS)
are usually built by acquiring
experimentally measured mass spectra from chemical reference compounds.
We here show the versatility of in-silico or computer generated tandem
mass spectra that are directly obtained from compound structures.
We use the freely available LipidBlast development software to generate
15 000 MS/MS spectra of the glucuronosyldiacylglycerol (GlcADG)
lipid class, recently discovered for the first time in plants. The
generation of such an in-silico MS/MS library for positive and negative
ionization mode took 5 h development time, including the validation
of the obtained mass spectra. Such libraries allow for high-throughput
annotations of previously unknown glycolipids. The publicly available
LipidBlast templates are universally applicable for the development
of MS/MS libraries for novel lipid classes.

==== Body
De novo structure elucidation
of novel compounds require multiple separation and purification steps
as well as the inclusion of complex analytical methods such as liquid
chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).
Such an approach has been shown recently for the discovery of glucuronosyldiacylglycerol
lipids (GlcADG) from phosphorus depleted plants.1 An alternative strategy for compound annotation is matching
experimental MS/MS spectra to in-silico predicted MS/MS spectra as
it has been shown for complex lipids using LipidBlast,2 demonstrating the applicability of such in-silico libraries
for 50 different types of low resolution and high resolution mass
spectrometers. While in-silico libraries like LipidBlast use heuristic
modeling of tandem mass spectra,2 prediction
of mass fragmentation patterns using first-principle methods has been
described recently by applying quantum chemical calculations for the
generation of MS1 electron ionization (EI)
spectra.3 Such principles might be transferable
to collision-induced tandem mass spectra in the future. LipidBlast
encompasses over 200 000 tandem mass spectra and covers 25
lipid classes and also provides development tools using Microsoft
Excel template files4 that can be utilized
to create in-silico MS/MS libraries for novel lipid classes and multiple
adduct ions. We have previously shown the versatility of such an approach
for the identification of mammalian stem cell lipids,5Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella minutissima algal lipid research6,7 and the identification of lipids in the flagellate protists Euglena gracilis.8 Using development
templates in standard software has several advantages. It enables
(1) addition of novel lipid classes that had not been covered in the
original LipidBlast survey, (2) addition of different acyl-chain lengths
or degrees of unsaturation that had not been covered by LipidBlast,
and (3) fast distribution of such open tandem mass spectral libraries
across laboratories. We here exemplify how a new in-silico library
can be developed including 15 000 MS/MS spectra for positive
and negative ionization mode in less than 5 h development and validation
time after experimental discovery of a single new plant lipid.

Methods
The development of new LipidBlast MS/MS spectra requires a development
sheet (Microsoft Excel) and a Visual Basic for Applications software
(Microsoft Excel VBA) that contains programmatic code to export the
MS/MS spectra. Extensive method details can be found in the original
LipidBlast publication.2 We concisely describe
the general approach here. The creation of new in-silico MS/MS libraries
requires sample MS/MS spectra for development and a series of MS/MS
spectra for validation. Spectra were taken from original experimental
measurements and the publication itself.1 These tandem mass spectra were used for developing the library.
The spectra were acquired on a hybrid ion trap/time-of-flight mass
spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI-IT-TOF-MS). Additional
supplemental raw MS/MS spectra from the same instrument were used
for validation. All spectra are freely available for download from
our Web site. Instead of a completely independent development, we
simply copied an existing member from the LipidBlast development sheet
(MSMS-prediction-distribute-v49.xls)4 and
chose a lipid class (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, SQDG) similar
to the novel GlcADG lipid class as a starter template. In-silico structures
were generated by replacing the SQDG core structure with GlcADG in
the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) structure
codes using text based find-and-replace in Microsoft Excel. The resulting
SMILES codes were used to calculate a series of required molecular
properties using the ChemAxon cxcalc command line tools.9 The properties included were accurate mass, octanol–water
partition coefficient (log P), and the InChIKey.
The values in the copied SQDG Microsoft Excel template sheet were
subsequently adjusted for the novel GlcADG adduct ions as well as
observed GlcADG fragmentations. The associated VBA code was modified
to allow the export of the GlcADG lipids. Tandem mass spectrometry
MSP files were converted by the LIB2NIST program, and the resulting
libraries were copied as a subdirectory into the NIST MS Search program.
The libraries were then used to further validate MS/MS spectra using
the NIST MS Search program and for batch-wise comparison using the
NIST MSPepSearch program.2,4

Results and Discussion
We created a total of 15 000 novel in-silico MS/MS spectra
for the glucuronosyldiacylglycerol lipid class using the LipidBlast
development templates. A total of 5000 tandem mass spectra were modeled
for positive [M + NH4]+ ionization mode and
10 000 MS/MS spectra for negative ionization mode [M –
H]−. The negative ionization mode numbers are twice
the size because they cover spectra for low-CID (collision-induced
dissociation) and high-CID voltage mode. Lipids with acyl carbon chain
lengths C2 to C26 and degrees of unsaturation
with double bond counts of 0–6 are included. The peak fragments
and their individual abundances were modeled according to a reference
spectrum obtained from an ion trap/time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(see Figure 1). This approach is feasible because
lipids follow very consistent fragmentation rules. For MS/MS library
search we used accurate mass precursor search with subsequent product
ion matching. The details of the matching procedure are outlined in
the original LipidBlast paper.2 Short,
the precursor filter removes many false candidates that fall outside
a given mass window. The subsequent product ion matching algorithm
uses traditional similarity scoring of remaining candidates. Reverse
search scores can be used in case of impurities or nonexplained peaks.10

Figure 1 Single published tandem mass spectrum from a novel plant
lipid
class glucuronosyldiacylglycerol (GlcADG) was used for development
of 5 000 related lipids. Using the LipidBlast templates in-silico
MS/MS spectra with different acyl chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation
were modeled. The tandem spectrum of GlcADG(18:3/16:0) shown here
is observed in negative ionization mode precursor m/z 765.51529 Da.

We validated the negative ionization mode in-silico MS/MS
spectra
with four experimentally obtained tandem mass spectra from the same
class (see Figure 2). These experimental spectra
matched the in-silico generated spectra, with one spectrum (GlcADG
36:4) generating multiple assignments, due to nonresolved ion peaks
and overlapping product ions. In the case of overlapping or not completely
resolved peaks by liquid chromatography as shown for GlcADG 36:4,
lower hit scores with more ambiguous compound annotations are obtained.
In order to increase hit scores we additionally modeled spectra for
low-CID and high-CID voltage mode. In low-CID voltage the precursor
ion has a higher peak intensity because it is not completely fragmented.
In high-CID voltage mode the precursor ion disappears due to complete
fragmentation and the fatty acyl intensities highly increase. The
CID voltage specific modeling allows for analysis of experimental
spectra from a wider range of instruments such as triple quadrupole
or Fourier transform (FT) mass spectrometers (see Figure 3). A final validation and application step was performed
on tandem mass spectra obtained from authentic reference standards
synthesized by Cao and Williams.11 The
paper also discussed specific product ion ratios for [M – H–sn2
+ H2O]− and for [M – H–sn1
+ H2O]− that can lead to the correct
positional assignment of sn1 and sn2 fatty acyls. Such total synthesis
approaches and detailed CID investigations with different ionization
voltages will be extremely valuable for assignments of regioisomers
in future versions of LipidBlast. Currently LipidBlast libraries cannot
annotate stereochemistry, regiospecificity, and position of double
bonds correctly. Also a number of bacterial fatty acids such as cyclic-,
prenyl-, and epoxy fatty acids are not yet included. However, the
lipid class as well as the total carbon and degree of unsaturation
of each of the fatty acyl chains can be correctly annotated. The positive
ionization mode [M + NH4]+ spectra were developed
in a similar way and validated with two independent MS/MS spectra.
The positive ion mode spectra are specific for hybrid ion trap/time-of-flight
mass spectrometers. No voltage optimization has been performed due
to the lack of additional reference spectra.

Figure 2 Additional published
tandem mass spectra were used for validation
of the novel LipidBlast library. All in-silico MS/MS spectra were
created using the freely available LipidBlast templates. In top panels
(red) the experimental MS/MS spectra are given, in lower panels (depicted
in blue), predicted MS/MS spectra validated this approach. These spectra
can be used for high-throughput annotations of lipids.

spectra from
different platforms. Left panel, MS/MS from Finnigan-MAT TSQ70 with

here are low-CID voltage spectra with abundant precursor ions. Experimental
spectra are depicted on top (red) and in-silico MS/MS spectra are
shown on the bottom (blue).

Our publicly available GlcADG glycolipid library has direct
translational
aspects that go beyond plant lipid research.12,13 Glucuronidated glycerolipids occur across several domains of life
or phylogenetic branches. Glucoronidyl (glucuronosyl) lipids containing
tuberculostearic acid (C18-methyl) were found and analyzed in mycobacterial
lipid extracts11,14,15 from Mycobacterium smegmatis (see left panel of
Figure 3) and other species. Recent research
discussed glycolipid antigen activity and the preferred binding of
natural killer cells (Va10 NKT) toward glucuronosyl diacylglycerol
lipids.16 It has to be mentioned that in
the current GlcADG LipidBlast library the C18-methyl group (tuberculostearic
acid) is not directly assigned but rather annotated as C19 fatty acid.
Glycolipids with similar structures were also observed in Gram-negative
bacteria, Pseudomonas diminuta,17,18Hyphomonas jannaschiana,19Agrobacterium tumefaciens,20 and Gram-positive bacteria such as Corynebacterium glutamicum.21 GlcADG related glycolipids were also
found in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.22 Diacylglyceryl-alpha-d-glucuronide
algal lipids have been found in Pavlova lutheri algae.23,24 The GlcADG lyso-forms (one acyl chain) as well as ether analogues
(plasmenyl, plasmanyl) have been described in the literature for use
as lipid haptens25 and synthesized for
membrane property estimations,26 but no
evidence has been found that they exist in nature yet.

Most
of the publications did not report MS/MS spectra in the past.
Subsequently such spectra could not be accumulated in large electronic
mass spectral databases such as Wiley MSforID,27 ReSpect,28 MassBank,29 NIST,30 or Metlin.31 We close that gap with our publicly available
in-silico MS/MS library, enabling future research groups to perform
high-throughput analysis of complex glycolipid mixtures by simply
extending and using LipidBlast.
