Metabolic
profiling studies aim to achieve broad metabolome coverage
in specific biological samples. However, wide metabolome coverage
has proven difficult to achieve, mostly because of the diverse physicochemical
properties of small molecules, obligating analysts to seek multiplatform
and multimethod approaches. Challenges are even greater when it comes
to applications to tissue samples, where tissue lysis and metabolite
extraction can induce significant systematic variation in composition.
We have developed a pipeline for obtaining the aqueous and organic
compounds from diseased arterial tissue using two consecutive extractions,
followed by a different untargeted UPLC-MS analysis method for each
extract. Methods were rationally chosen and optimized to address the
different physicochemical properties of each extract: hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) for the aqueous extract
and reversed-phase chromatography for the organic. This pipeline can
be generic for tissue analysis as demonstrated by applications to
different tissue types. The experimental setup and fast turnaround
time of the two methods contributed toward obtaining highly reproducible
features with exceptional chromatographic performance (CV % < 0.5%),
making this pipeline suitable for metabolic profiling applications.
We structurally assigned 226 metabolites from a range of chemical
classes (e.g., carnitines, α-amino acids, purines, pyrimidines,
phospholipids, sphingolipids, free fatty acids, and glycerolipids)
which were mapped to their corresponding pathways, biological functions
and known disease mechanisms. The combination of the two untargeted
UPLC-MS methods showed high metabolite complementarity. We demonstrate
the application of this pipeline to cardiovascular disease, where
we show that the analyzed diseased groups (n = 120)
of arterial tissue could be distinguished based on their metabolic
profiles.

==== Body
Metabolic
profiling relies on
the application of a range of analytical technologies to measure simultaneously
differential levels of multiple metabolites in biological matrices.1 It is important to ensure wide metabolome coverage
and consequently enhance biomarker detection probability. For this
an untargeted format is the approach of choice warranting the ability
to detect unmapped metabolites and pathways, as well as compounds
originating from environmental interactions unrelated to the biology
of the system studied.2,3 To compensate for the different
capabilities of each technique/method, their bias toward specific
classes of metabolites,4 and the wide physicochemical
diversity of the metabolome in a biological matrix, multiple platforms5−8 and methods4 are required to expand metabolite
coverage.

Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled
to mass spectrometry
(HILIC-MS) is a relatively new chromatographic tool applied in the
effort to expand metabolome coverage. The importance of HILIC is attributed
to its ability to generate profiles of mainly polar metabolites and
is therefore highly complementary to the traditionally used reversed-phase
(RP) chromatography.4 Several studies have
demonstrated superior partitioning abilities of HILIC columns for
polar compounds in biological matrices,4,9−11 predominantly urine samples.9,10,12,13 However, the application of HILIC
in metabolic profiling studies continues to present unresolved analytical
challenges particularly with respect to chromatographic performance.4,11,14,15

A previously described study aiming to expand metabolome coverage
combining RP-LC-MS and HILIC-MS was applied using an HPLC system.
This was translated into an extended 60 min run-time, and did not
address tissue analysis.4 Moreover, although
a combination of RP-, HILIC-, and CE-MS has been described by Saric
et al.,5 it focused on evaluating the abilities
of single-extraction methodologies for Fasciola hepatica worms rather than assessing biological pathway coverage of metabolites
detected.

Herein, we describe a combination of RP- and HILIC-UPLC-MS
methodologies
functioning in an untargeted mode with the aim of expanding metabolome
coverage. We focused on applying a UPLC-MS-based setup to tissue samples.
Tissue samples can provide unique information on physiological or
pathological mechanisms elucidation and biomarker discovery.16,17 However, tissue lysis and metabolite extraction, as well as establishing
the appropriate analysis combination can be challenging. We utilized
a simple extraction format, based on consecutive extraction steps,18 followed by a rational choice of UPLC-MS analysis,
according to the lipophilicity of the extracts, wherein the aqueous
extracts were analyzed using a HILIC and organic extracts by a RP
method. We applied the method to profile tissue from patients with
cardiovascular disease. The types of tissue used, such as atherosclerotic
plaque, have complex structure, intense presence of lipid molecules
and are biologically active. We evaluated the feasibility of analyzing
these complex tissue extracts, with emphasis on robust column performance,
stability, and longevity. The generic nature of the presented pipeline
was demonstrated with applications in additional tissue types. A comprehensive
structural assignment of detected ions was performed, resulting in
the generation of a database of 226 unique structurally assigned metabolites.
We further demonstrated the complementarity of the two chromatographic
methods applied, and employed pathway mapping tools to display their
contribution to expanding the coverage of metabolic pathways, biological
functions, and known disease mechanisms.

Samples
Research ethics committee
approval (RREC 2989
and RREC 3199) and patient informed consent was obtained for the collection
of tissue specimens from abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery
and carotid and femoral endarterectomy. Analyzed tissue samples consisted
of four groups of patients: 26 abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), 52
carotid stenosing plaques (CAR), 26 femoral stenosing plaques (FEM)
and 16 intimal thickening (INT). Samples obtained from endarterectomies
have been previously described.19 A table
with patient demographics can be found in Supporting
Information Table S-1.

Metabolite Extraction
Aqueous
Extraction
Tissue samples (153–416 mg)
were loaded into bead beating tubes (Percellys Steel-Kit) preloaded
with three steel beads. A prechilled methanol(MeOH)/water solution
(1:1), was added to the tissue samples. The volume of the solution
was adjusted according to weight of the sample starting at a maximum
weight with 1.5 mL, and reduced proportionally to sample weight (100
μL of solvent/28 mg of tissue). Tissue lysis and metabolite
extraction was performed using a bead beater (Bertin Technologies)
after freezing on dry ice. The bead beater was vibrating at 6500 Hz
for 40 s and 2 plus 2 cycles were performed separated by freezing
of the samples on dry ice. Bead beating was followed by centrifugation
(Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5417R, Germany) at 13000g for
20 min, at 4 °C. Aliquots of 100 μL (∼25 mg of tissue/100
μL of aliquot) of the supernatant were obtained into Eppendorf
tubes. Samples were spun in a vacuum concentrator for 3 h at 45 °C
(Eppendorf Concentrator Plus, V-AQ mode) until dry and stored at −40
°C until analysis.

Organic Extraction
Following aqueous
extraction a solution
of prechilled dichloromethane(DCM)/MeOH (3:1) was added to the residual
pellet. The volume of the solution was proportional to the sample
weight (as described in previous paragraph; aqueous extraction). Samples
were frozen on dry ice and reloaded into the bead beater (2 cycles,
6500 Hz, 40 s). Samples were then centrifuged at 13000g for 20 min, and 100 μL (∼25 mg of tissue/100 μL
of aliquot) of organic phase supernatant was subsequently aliquoted
into glass vials. Samples were allowed to evaporate at room temperature
in an extractor hood overnight and stored at −40 °C until
analysis.

HILIC-UPLC-MS Analysis of Aqueous Extracts
UPLC-MS
Analysis
The aqueous extracts of the tissue
samples were reconstituted in 200 μL of solvent mixture of H2O/ACN (5:95) and transferred into Total Recovery vials (Waters
Corp, USA), after centrifugation for 20 min at 13000g, 4 °C.

UPLC separation was conducted using an Acquity
UPLC System (Waters Corp, USA). An Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC 2.1 ×
100 mm, 1.8 μm, column (Waters Corp, USA) was used. Column temperature
was set at 35 °C. Mobile phase A consisted of acetonitrile (ACN)/water
(95:5) and mobile phase B ACN/water (50:50). In both solutions ammonium
acetate was diluted to 10 mM and formic acid to 0.1%. The elution
gradient was set as follows: 99% A (0.0–2.0 min; 0.4 mL/min),
99–45% A (2.0–8.0 min; 0.4 mL/min), 45–1% A (8.0–9.0
min; 0.4 mL/min), 1% A (9.0–9.1 min; 0.4–0.8 mL/min),
1% A (9.1–11.0 min; 0.8 mL/min), 1–99% A (11.0–11.1
min; 0.8 mL/min), 99% A (11.1–19.0 min; 0.8 mL/min), 99% A
(19.0–19.1 min; 0.8–0.4 mL/min), 99% A (19.1–23.0
min; 0.4 mL/min). An injection volume of 10 μL was used for
both positive and negative ionization polarity modes. The autosampler
was set at 4 °C. Mass spectrometry was performed using a Premier
Q-TOF (Waters MS Technologies Ltd., UK) with an electrospray ionization
(ESI) source. MS conditions can be found in Supporting
Information.

A standard QC strategy20 was used for
the UPLC-MS analysis. Briefly, a pooled sample (Quality Control Sample,
QC) of the reconstituted extracts was prepared. This sample was injected
at least 10 times before initiating the run, in order to condition
the column. Then the sample was reinjected once at the beginning,
every 10 sample injections, and at the end of the run (total of 13
injections) to assess instrument stability and analyte reproducibility.
Following sample analysis a QC sample dilution series (1:2, 1:4, 1:8)
in the reconstitution solvent mixture was performed and followed by
extraction blank sample. This strategy is also illustrated in Figure 1.

Data Extraction
Collected data were
subjected to peak-picking
and grouping using MarkerLynx XS (Waters Inc., v4.1) software. Parameters
used are presented in Supporting Information Table S-2. Values were reported as height of intensity peaks. Samples
were normalized to total intensity. Values were multiplied by 10 000
prior to statistical analyses. The dilution series was used here to
remove peaks that did not respond to dilution. This was achieved by
applying multivariate statistics to the QC samples and dilutions and
removing features (variables) that did not vary in intensity according
to the dilutions applied. Additionally, as the local anesthetic lidocaine
is typically locally administered to patients prior to performing
carotid endarterectomy, features attributed to lidocaine and its metabolite
hydroxylidocaine were removed from further statistical analyses.

RP-UPLC-MS Analysis (Lipid Profiling) of Organic Extracts
UPLC-MS Analysis
The organic extracts of the tissue
samples were reconstituted in 500 μL of the solvent mixture
of water/ACN/isopropanol (ISP) (1:1:2) and transferred into Total
Recovery vials (Waters Corp, USA), after centrifugation for 10 min
at 5000g and 4 °C.

UPLC separation was
conducted using an Acquity UPLC System (Waters Corp, USA). An Acquity
UPLC CSH C18 2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, column (Waters Corp,
USA) was used. Column temperature was set at 55 °C and flow rate
at 0.4 mL/min. Mobile phase A consisted of ACN/water (60:40) and mobile
phase B ISP/ACN (90:10). In both solutions ammonium formate was diluted
to 10 mM and formic acid to 0.1%. The elution gradient was set as
follows: 60–57% A (0.0–2.0 min), 57–50% A (2.0–2.1
min; curve 1), 50–46% A (2.1–12.0 min), 46–30%
A (12.0–12.1 min; curve 1), 30–1% A (12.1–18
min), 1–60% A (18.0–18.1 min), 60% A (18.1–20.0
min). Injection volumes of 3 and 7 μL were used for positive
and negative ionization modes, respectively. The autosampler was set
at 4 °C. Mass spectrometry was performed using a Xevo G2 QTof
(Waters MS Technologies, U.K.) with an electrospray ionization (ESI)
source. Both MS and MSE data scans were acquired. MS conditions
can be found in Supporting Information.
The same QC strategy was followed as for the HILIC-UPLC-MS analysis.

Data Extraction
After acquisition, data were centroided
(m/z spectra peaks are automatically
detected and their centroid is calculated based on the average m/z value and weighted by the intensity).
This was followed by peak-picking and grouping using MarkerLynx XS
(Waters Inc., v4.1) software. Parameters used are presented in Supporting Information Table S-2. Values were
reported as peak intensity (area). Saturated peaks (as identified
by the MassLynx software) were removed prior to total area normalization.
Values were multiplied by 10 000 prior to statistical analyses.

Safety Considerations
MeOH and ACN are known to be
harmful while DCM is harmful, considered toxic and may be carcinogenic.
These solvents should be handled in a fume hood and avoid skin contact
and inhalation. Safety considerations include obtaining appropriate
training prior to using these solvents and using appropriate waste
disposal since they can impose an environmental hazard.

Statistical
Analysis
Multivariate data analysis (MVDA)
was conducted using the SIMCA package (version 13.0.2.; Umetrics,
Sweden). Principal components analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection
to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed
to examine UPLC-MS data in a multivariate setting. Prior to model
fitting, features were subjected to Pareto scaling. Two-tailed t tests (assuming unequal variance), and coefficients of
variation % (CV%) were calculated in Microsoft Office Excel 2007.

Metabolite Structural Assignment
For metabolite structure
assignment, accurate m/z measurements
of detected chromatographic peaks were first matched to metabolites
from online MS databases (Metlin,21 HMDB,22 and Lipidmaps23).
After an assessment of retention time and isotopic pattern, tandem
MS (UPLC-MSE and UPLC-MS/MS) fragmentation pattern was
employed for further structural elucidation. Assignment according
to fragmentation pattern was dependent on the ability to obtain spectra
with adequate signal. Further, an authentic standard of the metabolite
was run using identical UPLC-MS/MS conditions and the detected m/z was matched to (1) the retention time
and, where possible, (2) the MS/MS spectrum obtained from the sample
under identical experimental conditions. Matching to an authentic
standard was dependent on commercial availability and was pursued
for small molecules. In Supporting Information Table S-3, the level of assignment is provided for every annotation
according to the following criteria: (1) Accurate mass matched to
database indicating tentative assignment, (2) accurate mass matched
to database and tandem MS spectrum matched to in silico fragmentation
pattern, (3) tandem MS spectrum matched to database or literature,
(4) retention time (RT) matched to standard compound, and (5) MS/MS
spectrum matched to standard compound.

Pathway Mapping
For pathway mapping the KEGG database24 (July 10, 2014 Update) and Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis software (IPA) (Build, 313398M; Version, 18841524) were used.

Venn Diagrams
Venn diagrams were constructed using
online available software (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html).

Results and Discussion
In the present study a simple
pipeline (Figure 1) was designed in order to
expand metabolome coverage and
analyte reproducibility in tissue samples. The well recognized limitations
of a single chromatographic mode to deliver broad metabolite coverage
motivated the utilization of both RP- and HILIC-UPLC-MS columns. Chromatographic
conditions were optimized to enhance separation of the detected compounds.
Further, we provide an experimental setup for untargeted metabonomic
settings, in order to support efficient metabolite assignment and
increase confidence of potential biomarkers. In addition, analytical
and RT reproducibility were also assessed using the 13 QC samples,
followed by an evaluation of metabolome coverage. Pathway mapping
methodologies were used to assess the extent of coverage of biological
pathways and functions. Lastly, an application to cardiovascular disease
related samples (n = 120) illustrated the ability
of the pipeline to deliver disease related metabolic profiles. The
successful analysis of a biologically active tissue with high lipid
content as a matrix ensures the robustness and wide applicability
of the developed methodologies.

Tissue Lysis and Extraction
Previous
work from our
laboratory18 has demonstrated that consecutive
extractions, that is, polar extraction followed by organic (rather
than a bilayer format) delivers higher reproducibility in tissue extraction.
Thus, consecutive extraction was applied here (Figure 1). Moreover, the use of bead-beating for tissue lysis has
also been demonstrated to be superior to other lysis methodologies,
such as manual grinding and electric homogenizer.6 For tissue lysis, bead-beating was used with preference
for steel beads, as from preliminary studies, it was observed that
steel beads were superior in homogenizing the calcified parts of the
plaque tissues, as compared to zirconium beads.

Optimization
of HILIC-UPLC-MS Analysis of Aqueous Extracts
For HILIC chromatographic
conditions, no pH mobile phase adjustment
was chosen, opting to keep the method unbiased in terms of basic or
acidic compounds. By using arterial tissue extracts, tests with longer
isocratic initial conditions did not result in improved chromatographic
separation.

The ability of the gradient program to adequately
re-equilibrate the system was also assessed. The re-equilibration
part of the gradient program was extended to accommodate adequate
stability prior to each injection, while ensuring analysis did not
exceed 23 min per sample making it attractive for application in large-scale
studies.

The effect of the reconstitution solvent on chromatographic
performance
was also assessed using different percentages of ACN. Specifically,
three different proportions of ACN were used (50%, 75% and 95% ACN)
to reconstitute pooled tissue extracts. This test aimed to explore
the hypothesis that low percentages of ACN in the reconstitution solvent
may disturb the major partitioning mechanism between the aqueous coating
formed in the HILIC column on the surface of the stationary phase
of the HILIC column and the analytes.25 It was found that when ACN was present at <95%, a number of chromatographic
peaks were split, resulting in two peaks -one eluting at the beginning
of the gradient program, and another at a higher retention time (Supporting Information Figure S-1). It was further
observed that low percentages of ACN could also distort the peak shape
(Supporting Information Figure S-1). These
observations were further verified using standard compounds dissolved
in different proportions of ACN (Supporting Information Figure S-2). Another advantage of using 95% ACN was that it made
the column less exposed to precipitating proteins, as proteins would
have been precipitated prior to injection. Preventing proteins from
precipitating and eventually blocking the column can be a challenge
in HILIC analysis, due to the highly organic initial solvent proportions
of the mobile phase system, causing the proteins dissolved in the
sample to precipitate as they enter the column. With the described
methodology it was observed that no increase in system pressure was
detected after 300 injections of tissue extracts (Supporting Information Figure S-3), indicating that there
was likely no buildup of proteins in the column. However, using a
highly organic solution for reconstitution could influence the desolvation
of polar compounds. It was observed that the sensitivity for some
of the polar compounds (detected toward the end of the chromatogram)
was affected, although these compounds were still detectable (Supporting Information Figure S-4).

Using
the HILIC method it was noted that low levels of lipid classes,
such as triacylglycerol (TG), diacylglycerol (DG), and cholesteryl
ester (CE) eluted with the solvent front (Supporting
Information Figure S-5), while several phospholipids eluted
in a narrow range in the middle part of the chromatogram (Figure 2C and D). This characteristic demonstrates an advantage
of HILIC over RP chromatography since lipid build-up in the column
is a known weakness of RP. Additionally, in RP methods, lipid elution
requires longer gradients and can span a wide range of the chromatographic
run, which could affect the detection of smaller molecules. Lipids
are highly abundant in biological matrices and are expected in higher
concentrations in tissue relevant to cardiovascular disease, such
as atherosclerotic plaques. Most importantly, it became clear from
early optimization experiments that the RP column could adequately
retain polar compounds (Supporting Information Figure S-6). The capabilities of the HILIC method were also assessed
using adipose tissue aqueous extracts (Supporting
Information Figure S-7).

ionization mode (ESI+), (B) negative electrospray ionization mode

(C) ESI+ and (D) ESI– from the lipid profiling analysis of
the organic extracts.

Optimization of Lipid Profiling via RP-UPLC-MS
Optimization
of the chromatographic separation stage of the lipid profiling methodology
was initially conducted using lipid standard mixtures. A charged surface
hybrid (CSH) column was used as it improved the separation of lipid
moieties between classes as well as within each class, spanning a
wide range of lipophilicity. Interclass separation is important as
it can assist in structural assignment of the lipids. Moreover, intraclass
separation can reduce ion suppression induced by coeluting lipids
of the same class. In fact, the use of HILIC chromatography for lipid
profiling was abandoned due to the insufficient intraclass lipid separation
(Figure 2) and inadequate partitioning of neutral
lipids (Supporting Information Figure S-5).

The CSH column also demonstrated short re-equilibration times between
injections, reducing analytical run length and increasing throughput.
Lastly, the use of ISP in the mobile phase and high column temperature
provided the ability to elute highly lipophilic compounds such as
TGs and CEs that would otherwise be strongly partitioned into the
stationary phase, thus reducing chromatographic performance and causing
carry over phenomena. We did not observe significant carry over effects
of any molecular class (Supporting Information Figure S-8).

The separation ability of the CSH column was
further assessed by
using isomers and cis- and trans- stereoisomers of the phosphatidylglycerol
(PG) lipid species. Firstly, separation the cis- compounds of the
PG(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) against PG(18:0(9Z)/18:2(9Z)) was demonstrated.
Additionally, separation of cis-PG(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) and trans-PG(18:1(9E)/18:1(9E))
was achieved (Supporting Information Figure
S-9). Lastly, the applicability of this column for analysis of real
biological samples was assessed by testing chromatographic performance
using rat, murine and human plasma organic extracts and bovine liver,
human arterial and adipose tissue organic extracts (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S-7).

UPLC-MS Experimental Setup
The use
of QC samples to
assess reproducibility and instrument performance and stability is
preferred in metabolic profiling studies.10,18,20 We herein employed the QC format and demonstrated
the usefulness of this approach to assess reproducibility using both
MVDA (Figure 3) and univariate statistics (Table 1 and Figure 4). We also included
in the analysis several extraction blank samples (Figure 1). The sample preparation procedure and solvent
impurities can introduce ions unrelated to the analyzed matrix. By
including extraction blank samples we were able to easily identify
and remove features present in the blank samples but not the matrix
of interest, using multivariate statistics (Supporting
Information Figure S-10). Verifying that the origin of the
ion of interest is matrix-related can minimize the possibility of
artifacts.

samples and the quality control samples (QC). The tight grouping of

We also included dilutions
of the pooled (QC) samples to assess
the ability of each ion to respond to fluctuations in concentration
(Figure 1). An initial assessment of the response
to dilutions was also performed–using only the 2-fold dilution
- prior to initiating analysis. The injection volume was adjusted
to optimize intensity response to dilution. The dilution series—injected
at the end of the run—assisted in identifying features that
were not responding to the subsequent dilutions (Supporting Information Figure S-11). Features demonstrating
an erratic behavior were observed in the HILIC analysis. This was
predominantly the case with lipid moieties of the same class. We hypothesized
that this may be due to the coelution of lipids and a resulting suppression
of their signals as a result of simultaneous ionization in the ESI
source. These features were removed from further analysis (Supporting Information Figure S-11). In literature,
there are suggestions on how the dilution series can assist in increasing
biomarker confidence.26

Collision-induced
dissociation (CID) experiments were applied to
the QC sample in order to obtain structural information for hundreds
of detected ions. This was conducted during the conditioning step
(Figure 1). Obtaining fragmentation patterns
of molecules of interest during the original profiling run can save
the analyst time and frustration, since variations in retention time
and instrument performance can occur when returning to the instrument
for tandem-MS experiments after long periods. Both unbiased UPLC-MS/MS
acquisition (DDA, data dependent acquisition), as well as acquisition
with no precursor ion selection (UPLC-MSE) were employed.
The DDA MS/MS experiments can provide fragments specifically attributed
to the precursor ion. On the other hand, the MSE approach,27 in combination with chromatographic separation,
proved very useful for structural assignment of metabolite classes,
as it can provide the analyst with retention times of characteristic
secondary ions upon fragmentation, known to be specific for metabolite
classes.

Figure 5 demonstrates how a
characteristic
fragment of carnitines (Figure 5B) assisted
in identifying several molecules from this group of compounds. Lastly,
we use the same gradient program for analyzing in positive and negative
ionization mode as it can provide valuable complementary information
aiding toward an easier metabolite structural assignment.

Reproducibility
Chromatographic Reproducibility
It has been reported
that chromatographic reproducibility can be a limiting factor especially
with HILIC columns,4,15 ultimately affecting data quality.
Peak retention time (RT) reproducibility was evaluated using the 13
QC samples interspersed throughout the run to calculate the CV%. The
most abundant ions per RT window in the QC samples were used for the
evaluation (Supporting Information Figure
S-12). The peaks of these ions demonstrated an RT CV % values of <0.5%.

Analytical Reproducibility
Using the 13 injections
of the QC samples, two statistical approaches were applied to evaluate
the analytical reproducibility of the two methodologies in terms of
detected intensities: (1) using PCA as a MVDA method to test reproducibility
and (2) by calculating the CV% of detected peaks as a univariate way.
The PCA demonstrated a tight grouping of the QC samples (Figure 3), indicative of their high reproducibility across
the run and confirming that the variation observed between the samples
(n = 120) was nonsystematic, but biologically related.
Additionally, >80% of the abundant features demonstrated CV values
of <30% (Table 1). Abundant features were
considered to be the features for which chromatographic peaks could
be detected in all of the 13 QC samples. It is important to exclude
features for which the peak intensity did not pass the peak-picking
intensity S/N threshold (or otherwise
not detected) as they could skew the value of the CV % calculation.
Table 1 summarizes the CV% reproducibility
analysis of all employed methodologies.

The high retention time
and analytical reproducibility of the detected ions demonstrate that
the presented methodologies can deliver the robustness required by
a metabolic profiling study.

Improvement in Metabolome
Coverage by Combining HILIC and RP
Methodologies
The scientific community is constantly striving
to expand metabolome coverage. This forces analysts to combine different
analytical platforms and methods in order to increase the number of
robustly detected metabolites. Multiplatform analyses are particularly
relevant when both polar and nonpolar metabolites require analysis.
Here, two UPLC-MS chromatographic methods were combined to expand
metabolome coverage resulting in a total of 226 unique metabolite
structural assignments (Figure 4 and Supporting Information Table S-3), ranging from
polar (e.g., amino acids, creatine, carnitines, purines, and pyrimidines)
to highly lipophilic metabolites (e.g., TGs and CEs). The two methods
demonstrated high complementarity, with only 20 intermethod metabolites
detected (Figure 6). These metabolites corresponded
to highly abundant lipid compounds with amphiphilic properties. With
the lipid profiling method, 97 metabolites were uniquely assigned,
with 29 commonly detected in both polarities (Figure 6). The HILIC method provided 109 unique metabolites with 18
detected by both of the HILIC polarity modes (Figure 6).

Figure 6 A Venn diagram demonstrating commonly and exclusively detected
metabolites for the employed analyses and electrospray ionization
modes. The vast number of metabolites robustly detected by only one
of the methods demonstrates the complementarity of the HILIC-UPLC-MS
and the lipid profiling methods when applied on the aqueous and organic
extracts, respectively. The diagram is based only on structurally
assigned metabolites. ESI+: positive electrospray ionization mode,
ESI-: negative electrospray ionization mode.

Several molecules were preferentially ionized in only one
of the
MS polarities. This was particularly obvious with compound classes
such as TGs, CEs and acyl-carnitines preferentially ionizing in positive
mode, while classes such as free fatty acids, phosphatidylinositols,
phosphatidylserines and sulfated compounds preferentially ionized
in negative mode. Additionally, metabolites detected by both polarities
can frequently provide essential information to guide structural assignment.
In fact, for several species tandem MS spectra from both polarities
were required for achieving structural assignment, thus demonstrating
the necessity of analyzing both intramethod polarities with the same
chromatographic gradient. Overall, a substantial amount of extra information
was obtained by using both polarity modes, resulting in expansion
of metabolome coverage and assisting metabolite structure assignment.

It should be noted that the detected metabolite list (Figure 6 and Supporting Information Table S-3) does not represent all the metabolites that can be detected
by the described experiments, nor exhausts the ability of these methods
for detection of additional metabolites. Factors such as tissue specificity
can affect the concentrations or presence of specific molecules. Moreover,
several ions could not be structurally assigned due to ambiguity of
their m/z, inadequate tandem MS
information, or absence from online databases and are not further
described here. At the same time, several administered drugs were
also detected, such as the local anesthetics bupivacaine, lidocaine
and their metabolites such as hydroxylidocaine. However, they are
not further discussed as the study focuses predominantly on endogenous
compounds.

Using the HILIC method, carnitine, carnitine derivatives,
such
as acylcarnitines incorporating fatty acyl chains (FAC) in the range
of 22C to acetylcarnitine, were detected. The chromatographic profile
of the structurally assigned carnitine derivatives and carnitine is
presented in Figure 5. Additionally, nine α-amino
acids (α-AA), and α-AA derivatives, such as N-acetylmethionine, purines and pyrimidines (Figure 2), as well as sphinganine and the 16C and 18C sphingosines,
organic acids (benzoic and salicylic), nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide,
creatine and creatinine, betaine, glycerophosphate derivatives, sugars,
acylcholines, could be indentified in the aqueous tissue extracts.

Using the lipid profiling method we detected phospholipids from
the classes of: phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols,
phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, lysophosphatidylcholines,
and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (Figure 2). Additionally, sphingolipids with different backbone lengths and
degree of unsaturation were identified (d18:0, d18:1, d18:2, d16:1
and d17:1). Sphingolipids detected included ceramides, sphingomyelins,
phosphatidylethanolamine-ceramides (PE-Cer), mono-, di-, tri-, and
tetra-hexosylceramides. Free fatty acids were another lipid class
detected using the negative mode of the lipid profiling method (Figure 2B). FFA in the range of 16–22C were detected,
while cis- and trans- stereoisomers (elaidic and oleic acid; linoelaidic
and linoleic acid) could be chromatographically resolved (Supporting Information Figure S-13). Glycerolipids
were detected in the form of DGs and TGs and in a wide range of incorporated
FAC. Finally, sterol lipids such as cholesterol, cholesteryl esters,
oxidized cholesteryl esters (Figure 2A) and
cholesterol sulfate were identified. Lipid structural assignments
would typically include elucidation of FAC length and degree of unsaturation.
However, the double bond and sn- positions could not be elucidated
using the MS approach employed here.

Finally, it should be highlighted
that the untargeted format of
the two methodologies is capable of identifying previously uncharacterized
compounds, a critical advantage compared to targeted approaches. An
example is the previously unreported forms of PE-Cers (PE-Cer(d18:1/16:0)
and PE-Cer(d18:1/24:1)) (Figure 4 and Supporting Information Table S-3). Additionally,
acylcholines, such as arachidonoylcholine and palmitoylcholine (Figure 4 and Table S-3), were
not listed in the MS databases used.

Pathway Mapping
Out of the 229 assigned metabolites,
187 could be mapped using the KEGG24 database
and a KEGG ID could be assigned (Supporting Information Table S-3). A total of 100 KEGG IDs were considered unique. Using
the KEGG mapper (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper.html),
a mapped overview of the primary human metabolic pathways demonstrated
49 mapped metabolites (Supporting Information Figure S-14). However, it was observed that some primary metabolic
pathways were lacking representation. This was evident with the central
carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism (fatty acids <16C)
and glycan metabolism. Coverage of these pathways will be subsequently
pursued with appropriate platforms and methods, along with efforts
for further unbiased expansion of the range of the detected and structurally
assigned metabolites. Nonetheless, using the IPA software a wide range
of canonical pathways, biological functions and disease pathways could
be covered by the assigned metabolites. Up to 89 out of the 100 KEGG
IDs imported in the IPA software were recognized. These metabolites
could be mapped by IPA to 182 canonical pathways (Supporting Information Figure S-15 and Spreadsheet S-1). Most
importantly, 60 unique metabolites could be associated and mapped
to vast number of diseases and biological functions (Supporting Information Figure S-16 and Spreadsheet S-2). These
included lipid accumulation and concentration, cancer, inflammation,
cell death and survival, proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, peroxisomal
disorder and cell differentiation. Additionally, 36 assigned metabolites
could be mapped being involved in 99 toxicity functions (Supporting Information Figure S-17 and Spreadsheet
S-3), such as liver damage, cardiac damage, and renal failure.

Application
to Cardiovascular Disease
According to
the World Health Organization (WHO), CVD is the leading cause of mortality
in the western world. Deaths associated with CVD are mainly related
to atherosclerosis and hypertension. Here, we used diseased human
tissue from the arterial tree to assess the ability of the RP lipid
profiling and the HILIC polar phenotyping methods to deliver metabolic
profiles relevant to tissue phenotype. Human tissues samples (n = 120) were used, obtained from 26 abdominal aortic aneurysm
(AAA) tissue, 52 carotid stenosing plaque (CAR), 26 femoral stenosing
plaques (FEM), and 16 from intimal thickening plaque-free tissue (INT).
The tissue used is known to be biologically active with presence of
several inflammatory factors contributing to the disease process.
Additionally, plaque tissue incorporates high lipid content with macroscopically
discrete substructure. These features (high lipid and protein content)
of the chosen analyzed tissue demand robust pipeline and tools to
avoid compromising optimal performance. The successful metabolic profiling
of such tissue, as evidenced by the high reproducibility and number
of metabolites detected, further demonstrates the robustness of our
pipeline and developed methodologies.

Using OPLS-DA fitted models
to explore differences in tissue metabolic phenotypes, separation
of the four tissue groups was apparent as demonstrated by the cross-validated
scores plots in Figure 7, along with models
characteristics. The model characteristics presented well-fitted models
with high predictive values (Q2Y:0.44–0.52; Figure 7). Intriguing findings from this data set were (1)
manifested differences between the two plaque groups CAR and FEM,
since it demonstrates that plaques from different locations express
distinct metabolic activity, and (2) the similarities observed by
the FEM and AAA groups. Loadings plots showing the metabolites driving
the separations between the sample groups can be found in Supporting Information Figure S-18. However,
biological interpretation of these findings exceeds the scope of this
paper and is not further discussed. Biological interpretation for
the comparison between INT tissue and CAR and FEM plaques has been
previously described.19

and (C, D) negative electrospray ionization mode (ESI−) from

extracts.

Conclusions
We
demonstrate that a combination of RP- and HILIC-UPLC-MS methodologies
delivers improved ability to achieve broad metabolome coverage of
compounds with diverse physicochemical properties. Additionally, these
chromatographic methods are highly complementary, further illustrating
the necessity for rationally combining RP and HILIC methods for analyzing
organic and aqueous tissue extracts, respectively. Importantly, this
pipeline can cover a wide range of metabolic pathways and biological
functions, while their untargeted format allows for the detection
of previously unknown metabolites. The implementation of DDA and MSE acquisitions on pooled QC samples within the analytical run,
permits simultaneous collection of metabolite structural information
and reduces the time of the analytical pipeline. The described pipeline
is generic and applicable to other tissue types. In future, the described
methodologies will be complemented with additional methods and platforms
to address gaps in metabolome coverage identified by the pathway mapping
procedures.
