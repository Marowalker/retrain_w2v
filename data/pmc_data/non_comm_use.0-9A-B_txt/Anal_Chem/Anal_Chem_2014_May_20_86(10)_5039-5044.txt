Many
high-throughput analytical platforms, from next-generation
DNA sequencing to drug discovery, rely on beads as carriers of molecular
diversity. Microfluidic systems are ideally suited to handle and analyze
such bead libraries with high precision and at minute volume scales;
however, the challenge of introducing bead suspensions into devices
before they sediment usually confounds microfluidic handling and analysis.
We developed a bead suspension hopper that exploits sedimentation
to load beads into a microfluidic droplet generator. A suspension
hopper continuously delivered synthesis resin beads (17 μm diameter,
112,000 over 2.67 h) functionalized with a photolabile linker and
pepstatin A into picoliter-scale droplets of an HIV-1 protease activity
assay to model ultraminiaturized compound screening. Likewise, trypsinogen
template DNA-coated magnetic beads (2.8 μm diameter, 176,000
over 5.5 h) were loaded into droplets of an in vitro transcription/translation
system to model a protein evolution experiment. The suspension hopper
should effectively remove any barriers to using suspensions as sample
inputs, paving the way for microfluidic automation to replace robotic
library distribution.

High-throughput
robotic chemistry
and biology, the paradigm that drove the Human Genome Project1 and the Molecular Libraries Initiative,2 has reached a technology development plateau
after decades of incremental improvements to existing microplate-based
fluid-handling.3 Where microplate miniaturization
has not broken the microliter-scale, microfluidic water-in-oil droplets,
the picoliter equivalents of microplate wells, effectively reduce
reaction volumes by 5 orders of magnitude. However, performing assays
such as PCR, enzyme kinetics, directed evolution, and drug screening4−8 at the droplet scale introduces a common front-end engineering challenge:
individual droplets must eventually house multiple copies of a distinct
library member. Nucleic acid libraries can be stochastically diluted,
compartmentalized, and then amplified in situ from single progenitor
molecules (e.g., PCR, rolling circle amplification, cellular replication),9,10 although this strategy is not applicable to other types of molecular
libraries.

A general solution to interfacing both biological
and chemical
diversity with droplet-scale analysis lies in preparing and storing
the diversity on solid phase resin beads. Beads are excellent delivery
vehicles because each bead can harbor multiple copies (up to ∼1
pmol, depending on surface chemistry and bead size) of a unique library
member. For example, emulsion PCR amplification generates bead-based
gene libraries11 while split-and-pool combinatorial
synthesis12,13 efficiently yields bead-based small molecule
libraries. Bead libraries (and microparticles in general), however,
are challenging media for microfluidic analysis because device loading
must be complete before the suspension has settled (e.g., in a syringe
barrel, tubing, etc.). Larger, denser beads exacerbate this loading
problem because they sediment even more quickly. Ironically, it is
easier to make a bead in situ14,15 than it is to load
one. Here, we present a simple method for introducing large bead populations
to microfluidic devices using a “suspension hopper”
that exploits a suspension’s tendency to sediment. Model ultraminiaturized
compound screening and directed evolution applications, each employing
a different resin particle, illustrate the general applicability of
the suspension hopper to distribute multiple copies of a unique molecule
into droplets.

Experimental Section
Device Operation and Imaging
Aqueous droplets (∼100
pL) in oil were generated at a flow focusing channel intersection.16 The oil phase consisted of (50:46:4 w/w/w) silicone
oil (DMF-A-6CS, Shin-Etsu, Akron, OH), mineral oil, and surfactant
(KF-6038, Shin-Etsu). Oil (0.9 μL/min) was driven into the circuit
through the OIL inlet, and aqueous phase (PSS, 0.3 μL/min) was
driven into the circuit through the BUF inlet. Droplet generation
frequency was measured using an inverted epifluorescence microscope
(10×, 0.25 NA, Axio Observer A1, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped
with a high-speed CCD (500 fps, 640 × 480 res, NR4S1, Integrated
Design Tools, Tallahassee, FL). After generation, the droplets enter
a 200 μm-wide channel for dynamic imaging. The droplet stream
was dispensed into PDMS wells prefilled with oil (∼50 μL)
for experiments requiring continuous fluorescence monitoring.

Gravity-Based
Bead Introduction and Dynamic Imaging
The suspension hopper
is a modified pipet tip (L-200, Rainin Instrument,
Oakland, CA). The filter was excised from the tip, and a PDMS plug
(4 mm diameter) was cemented into the larger end with uncured PDMS.
Once filled with a bead suspension, the hopper was inserted into the
LIB inlet downstream from BUF inlet. Image acquisition utilized an
inverted fluorescence microscope (5×, 0.12 NA, AxioCam ICm1,
Zeiss). As the beads settled into the circuit, 10 images were captured
(1 Hz) every 10 min for up to 6 h (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Image data were analyzed (ImageJ,
NIH, Bethesda MD) to tally droplets encapsulating 0 beads, 1 bead,
2 beads, etc.

Photolytic Cleavage of Compound from Beads
Droplets
encapsulating beads displaying fluorescent peptide (Figure S2, synthesis
and characterization details in Supporting Information) on their surface were dispensed into wells as described. Droplets
were dosed with UV light from a X-Cite 120Q lamp (Lumen Dynamics Group
Inc., Mississauga, Canada) through an open objective port using Zeiss
filter set 49 (λex = 365 nm; λdc = 395 nm; λem = 445/50 nm). Exposure energy (2–860
J/cm2) was measured using a photometer equipped with an
I-line sensor (ILT 1400-A and XRL340B, International Light Technologies,
Peabody, MA). Droplets were imaged (10×, 0.25 NA) in both bright
field and fluorescence mode through Zeiss filter set 38HE (λex = 470/40 nm; λdc = 495 nm; λem = 525/50 nm). Image data were analyzed (ImageJ) to determine
droplet size, bead size, and mean droplet fluorescence (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

Droplet-Based HIV-1 Protease
Assay
The model droplet-based
compound screen used a microfluidic circuit with two aqueous inputs
that combine immediately prior to the droplet-generating intersection
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). One
aqueous input (0.3 μL/min) contained fluorogenic substrate (1.25×)
and Alexa Fluor 647-dextran (2.67 μM) as an internal standard
in assay buffer. The other aqueous input (0.2 μL/min) contained
HIV-1 protease in vitro transcription/translation reaction product
diluted 5-fold in assay buffer. The combined inputs were dispersed
into droplets (∼100 pL) by flow-focusing with oil (1.1 μL/min).
A suspension hopper was loaded with a filtered (20 μm mesh,
CellTrics, Partec GmbH, Görlitz, Germany) suspension of beads
displaying pepstatin A (140 μL, 1 mg/mL, Figure S5, Supporting Information; synthesis and characterization
details in Supporting Information) and
inserted into the device. Droplets were dispensed into wells and dosed
with UV light (0–99 J/cm2) as described previously,
liberating up to 600 fg of pepstatin A from each bead. After UV irradiation,
the wells were incubated (2 h, 37 °C). Droplets were imaged as
before using the epifluorescence microscope and filter set 38HE for
the probe and a custom filter set (Omega Optical, Inc., Brattleboro,
VT) for the internal standard (λex = 600/50 nm; λdc = 640 nm; λem = 650 nm). Image data (Figure
S6, Supporting Information) were analyzed
(ImageJ) to measure mean droplet intensity.

Droplet-Based in Vitro
Expression of Trypsin
Trypsin
was expressed in droplets of in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT)
reagent using the dual-input microfluidic circuit (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The first aqueous input
(0.1 μL/min, IVTT solution A) and second aqueous input (0.1
μL/min, IVTT solution B, 80 ng/mL enterokinase, 2× disulfide
bond enhancer, 50 μM fluorogenic thrombin substrate) combined
1:1 to deliver fully reconstituted protein expression reaction mixture
for droplet generation in oil (0.8 μL/min). A suspension hopper
was loaded with magnetic beads (140 μL, 1,360 beads/μL)
displaying the gene encoding trypsinogen (the zymogen precursor of
trypsin) and inserted into the device as described. Droplets were
dispensed into wells and incubated (3 h, 37 °C). Droplets were
imaged using the epifluorescence microscope and filter set 38HE.

Results and Discussion
Suspension Hopper Design
We devised
a solution to the
bead-loading problem that exploits the natural tendency of beads to
settle. Beads sediment from a capped cartridge (“suspension
hopper”) into a continuously perfusing carrier stream. Integrating
the suspension hopper with a droplet generator (Figure 1A) provides a robust and scalable method for library bead
distribution into picoliter-volume droplets. The suspension hopper
funnels sedimenting beads into the LIB inlet port. As beads enter
the device, buffer from the BUF inlet port sweeps the beads downstream
(Figure 1B) to a cross-junction where two focusing
oil streams encapsulate the beads in droplets. The hopper eliminates
dead volume, and the cap prevents buffer from exiting the circuit
at LIB.

Figure 1 Suspension hopper circuit schematic and device operation. (A) Oil,
buffer, and compound library beads enter at input ports OIL, BUF,
and LIB. Buffer and beads combine with oil at the cross junction (★)
to generate bead-containing droplets, which exit at the output port
OUT. The micrograph (inset) shows beads (false orange color) distributed
in picoliter droplets (scale = 100 μm). (B) The suspension hopper
continuously introduces beads via sedimentation into LIB. Buffer flow
orthogonal to sedimentation carries the beads to the cross junction
for encapsulation.

The suspension hopper
represents a significant departure from tedious
bead delivery methods. For rapidly settling suspensions, introduction
of high-density media such as glycerol can counteract sedimentation
by modulating bead buoyancy. However, high-density additives can interfere
with droplet generation and compromise biological activity. Constant
agitation, an alternative, is difficult for suspensions housed in
syringes and does not prevent bead sedimentation in connectors or
tubing. More drastic measures such as suspending lab equipment vertically
are impractical and potentially dangerous. Smaller beads can greatly
reduce sedimentation rates, thus ameliorating problems with loading
via syringe pumps; however, some applications require higher loading
capacities (e.g., compound screening requires ∼100 amol, 100
times the capacity of a 1 μm-diameter bead). The suspension
hopper, engineered in response to these problems, introduces beads
into a circuit continuously and reproducibly (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The simplicity of the
design, inspired by the capped cell-perfusion chamber of Dishinger
et al.17 and the concept of gravity-driven
flow,18 should integrate easily with a
wide variety of microfluidic circuits for analyzing microparticles.

Bead Loading Performance
We demonstrated the utility
and scalability of the suspension hopper by distributing beads of
two different sizes into droplets. A 140 μL hopper delivering
a suspension of large-format Tentagel synthesis resin beads (∼800,000
mL–1, 17 μm diameter) continuously introduced
95% of the beads (112,000) within 2.67 h as shown in the integration
of the bead introduction rate (Figure 2A, gray
trace). A suspension hopper delivering small-format magnetic beads
(∼1,360,000 mL–1, 2.8 μm diameter)
continuously introduced 95% of the beads (176,000) within 5.5 h (Figure 2B, gray trace). For both resin scales, bead introduction
rate (Figure 2, black traces) exhibits a marked
peak at 1 h for 17 μm-diameter resin and at 4 h for 2.8 μm-diameter
resin. The rate of bead encapsulation into droplets (Figure 2, top colored traces) resulted in minor deviations
between observed and expected bead encounter probabilities based on
Poisson statistics (Figure 2, bottom colored
traces). As bead introduction commences, there is a pronounced deficiency
in the number of one-bead droplets and an accompanying surplus in
multibead droplets and empty droplets. Toward the apex of bead introduction
(0.8 h for Tentagel resin, 3.8 h for magnetic resin), this behavior
inverts to a surplus of one-bead droplets and deviations from the
Poisson distribution decay for all bead-droplet pairings.

Figure 2 Statistical
analysis of suspension hopper performance. Integration
of the bead introduction rate (black trace, left axis) over time results
in cumulative bead introduction for (A) 17 μm-diameter TentaGel
synthesis resin and (B) 2.8 μm-diameter magnetic resin (gray,
right axis). As beads are encapsulated into droplets (top color traces),
the encounter probability deviates only slightly from the expected
Poisson distribution (bottom color traces). 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 bead
droplets are represented by brown, red, dark blue, yellow, light blue,
and pink, respectively. Inset micrographs present example droplet
classes. Scale = 30 μm.

The encounter probability of beads loaded from a suspension
hopper
and encapsulated in droplets agrees well with the Poisson distribution,
indicating that it is a stochastic and therefore predictable process.
Still, we observe slight but systematic deviations from the predicted
probabilities. The surplus of multibead droplets prior to the bead
introduction apex is likely due to the presence of bead clusters,
which sediment more quickly in the hopper than single beads. The surplus
of one-bead droplets after the bead introduction apex suggests systematic
ordering independent of bead size. This effect may be similar to that
of channel motifs designed to induce ordered particle flows and controlled
encapsulation, leading to significant deviations from the expected
Poisson distribution.19,20 Even as the encounter probability
changes over the course of bead introduction, when 95% of each suspension
has been encapsulated, 82.6% and 79.6% of occupied droplets contain
a single 17 μm or 2.8 μm bead, respectively. While the
presence of one bead inside a droplet is ideal, there is a balance
between minimizing multibead droplets and maximizing the size of the
library in the hopper. Implementing larger droplet generation rates
drives down the frequency of multibead droplets, facilitating the
use of larger bead concentrations (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

Photochemical Droplet Dosing
After encapsulation, the
desired reaction between the bead-displayed library member and the
assay mixture can proceed. Molecules can remain on-bead for many screening
applications, but it is highly advantageous for some screens, particularly
small molecule screens, to be performed “off-bead,”21−23 requiring the liberation of molecule from the bead surface (Figure 3A). A fluorescent peptide attached to synthesis
resin beads via an o-nitrobenzyl photolabile linker
(1, Figure S2, Supporting Information) served as a model compound to demonstrate ultraviolet (UV) photochemical
droplet dosing. A suspension hopper introduced 1-functionalized
beads into the microfluidic circuit for encapsulation in droplets,
collection in oil-filled PDMS wells, and exposure to varying doses
of UV light to induce linker photolysis. Only the beads fluoresce
prior to exposure. UV irradiation liberates 1 from the
bead surface (Figure 3B). The droplet concentration
of 1 plateaus at 32 μM after exposure, and an abundance
of fluorophore remains linked to the bead. The variance associated
with compound liberation in droplets is 8–10% RSD, with deviation
in coupled bead and droplet volume (8% RSD) and photolabile linker
coupling efficiency. Compound release from a sample of 15 encapsulated
beads exhibits biphasic kinetics with kfast = 35 ± 1 × 103 J–1 and kslow = 9 ± 3 × 102 J–1 (Figure 3C), in agreement
with previously observed o-nitrobenzyl linker photolysis
kinetics.24

Figure 3 Photochemical compound
dosing. TentaGel resin beads (gray circle)
functionalized with an o-nitrobenzyl photolabile
linker and rhodamine 110-labeled model compound (1, green)
served as a reference for dosing studies. (A) Prior to UV exposure, 1 is localized to the bead. UV irradiation induces linker
photolysis, liberating 1 from the surface and allowing
it to diffuse throughout the droplet. (B) Droplets imaged in bright
field (left, scale = 30 μm) and fluorescence mode before (middle)
and after (right) UV exposure illustrate experimentally the liberation
of 1 from the bead and concomitant droplet dosing. (C)
Photolytic cleavage of 1 from the bead surface as a function
of UV dose (n = 15 droplets) exhibits biphasic kinetics
(cleavage kinetics for high UV doses, inset).

Model Compound and Directed Evolution Screens
One example
application where off-bead functional assay can provide an advantage
is droplet-scale compound screening. Synthesis resin beads functionalized
with an o-nitrobenzyl photolabile linker and ∼100
fmol of aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A (2, Figures 4 and S5, Supporting Information) served as the positive control. A dual-aqueous-input circuit and
suspension hopper encapsulated positive control beads in droplets
containing HIV-1 protease activity assay. Once a bead is encapsulated
with assay components, UV irradiation doses the droplet volume with 2. HIV-1 protease digests the fluorogenic substrate in empty
droplets, yielding high signal at the substrate fluorescence wavelength
relative to signal at the internal standard fluorescence wavelength
(Figure 4A). Bead-occupied droplets exhibit
UV-dose-dependent [2], which inhibits HIV-1 protease
activity and results in low substrate fluorescence relative to the
internal standard fluorescence. The Z-factor (Z′),
a measure of assay quality,25 for droplets
dosed with 99 J/cm2 UV light is 0.82 whereas undosed droplets
containing positive control beads exhibit insignificant HIV-1 protease
inhibition (Figure S9, Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Bead-based assays in picoliter-scale droplets. (A) UV-photocleavable
pepstatin A (1, red) attached to TentaGel resin beads
(gray circle with red diamond) were distributed into droplets along
with HIV-1 protease (yellow), fluorogenic HIV-1 protease substrate
(F-Q), and internal standard. After UV exposure, bead-occupied droplets
contain significant pepstatin A concentration (red droplet), inhibiting
proteolytic F-Q digestion. In empty negative control droplets, F-Q
proteolysis is uninhibited (blue droplet). (B) Magnetic beads functionalized
with trypsinogen gene were distributed into droplets containing IVTT
reagent, enterokinase, and a fluorogenic trypsin substrate (F-Q).
In occupied droplets, trypsin expression leads to substrate proteolysis
and fluorescence. No trypsin is expressed in empty droplets, and the
substrate remains quenched. Scale = 100 μm.

A second example screening application is a model droplet-scale
directed evolution experiment. A biotinylated trypsinogen gene is
attached to streptavidin-functionalized magnetic beads. A dual-aqueous-input
circuit and suspension hopper introduced beads functionalized with
DNA encoding the trypsinogen gene and encapsulated the beads in droplets
of IVTT reagent mixed with tryptic fluorogenic substrate (Figure 4B). Transcription of trypsinogen mRNA from bead-displayed
template DNA, mRNA translation of the zymogen trypsinogen, and enterokinase-catalyzed
cleavage of the synthetic propetide from the zymogen N terminus yielded
active trypsin. IVTT of template DNA and concomitant proteolytic digestion
of quenched substrate to fluorescent product only occurred in bead-occupied
droplets; empty droplets did not exhibit detectable tryptic activity.
Although dilution of template to the single molecule limit is the
simplest method for populating each droplet with a single library
element, one molecule in a 100 pL droplet is insufficient template
concentration for generating detectable tryptic activity. Template-functionalized
beads, however, enable efficient droplet-scale IVTT by delivering
∼10,000 molecules to each droplet (∼0.2 nM), which collectively
yield robust proteolytic activity after 3 h.

Droplet-scale miniaturization
is poised to revolutionize biological
and chemical library screening. The ability to perform millions of
reactions using only 100 μL of material trivializes the cost
of screening reagents and opens up new avenues for assay development.
For instance, we generated enough HIV-1 protease for millions of droplets
from its gene in 2.5 h using ordinarily cost-prohibitive IVTT reagents.
The amount of fluorogenic peptide probe sourced from either of two
(thrombin or HIV-1 protease) commercial biochemical activity assay
kits intended for ∼100 microplate-scale reactions is sufficient
for 15 droplet-scale screening campaigns, performing ∼50 million
total assay reactions. Assays that require all constituents to be
free in solution can be performed with photochemical droplet dosing.
A single 17 μm-diameter synthesis resin bead displays ∼100
fmol sites available for functionalization, thus cleaving only 1%
of sites will generate a 10 μM solution within a 100 pL droplet.
This mode of droplet dosing does not require mechanical agitation
of the droplet interface and is tunable over several orders of magnitude.
Further system engineering is now required to integrate this process
with bead loading and droplet generation to recapitulate the entire
robotic compound distribution front end of an HTS facility in a single
microfluidic circuit.

Conclusions
Picoliter-scale droplet
screening coupled with microfluidic integration
can eventually obsolete robotic sample handling, but an efficient
and scalable strategy for distributing discrete library elements into
droplets remains a significant and unmet challenge.26 Although diversity preparation in situ is possible by chemical
synthesis27 or amplification from single
progenitors,9 it is often advantageous
to decouple library preparation from screening.28 Particles are convenient to this end because they can serve
both as synthesis scaffold and clonal polyvalent vehicles, ranging
in size from viruses29 and cells30 to ∼100 μm-diameter beads.31,32 Compared to biological scaffolds, beads can display a wider array
of chemotypes (e.g., small molecules, peptides, dsDNA). Their large
size translates to valency sufficient for dosing droplets with a range
of cargo concentrations typical of screening-type experiments, but
simultaneously raises problems associated with suspension settling
in microfluidic circuitry. The suspension hopper is a simple and scalable
front-end component that can interface large bead-based libraries
with downstream integrated microfluidic automation. Populations of >100,000
beads were continuously introduced to a microfluidic circuit and distributed
into droplets within hours. Encapsulation of the introduced beads
is stochastic, allowing prediction of bead distribution via the Poisson
distribution. Incorporation of a photocleavable linker allows tunable
dosing of bead-occupied droplets with compound in applications that
require off-bead screening. Taken together, the suspension hopper
provides a critical bridge that connects bead-based molecular diversity
to picoliter-scale analysis and will drive innovation toward a sustainable
and distributed microfluidic bead library screening platform.
