Capillary
zone electrophoresis (CZE) with an electrokinetically
pumped sheath-flow nanospray interface was coupled with a high-resolution
Q-Exactive mass spectrometer for the analysis of culture filtrates
from Mycobacterium marinum. We confidently identified
22 gene products from the wildtype M. marinum secretome
in a single CZE–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) run. A total
of 58 proteoforms were observed with post-translational modifications
including signal peptide removal, N-terminal methionine excision,
and acetylation. The conductivities of aqueous acetic acid and formic
acid solutions were measured from 0.1% to 100% concentration (v/v).
Acetic acid (70%) provided lower conductivity than 0.25% formic acid
and was evaluated as low ionic-strength and a CZE–MS compatible
sample buffer with good protein solubility.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry-based
proteomics
is an effective tool for protein identification, characterization,
and quantitation.1−3 Most proteomic studies employ a bottom-up approach
where proteins are enzymatically digested, and the resulting peptides
are then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to infer the identity
of proteins in the sample. While fast and efficient, this analysis
seldom generates complete protein coverage. The resulting gaps can
hide both post-translational modifications and alternative splice
forms.

In contrast, top-down proteomics employs tandem mass
spectrometry
to analyze intact proteins. When successful, this analysis generates
outstanding sequence coverage and aids in the identification and localization
of post-translational modifications.4−6 However, top-down proteomics
requires sophisticated front-end separation and extremely high-resolution
mass spectrometers. High-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry was first employed in top-down
protein analysis by McLafferty’s group.6−8 That group later
demonstrated the successful characterization of proteins with masses
greater than 200 kDa.9 One of the most
impressive demonstrations of top-down proteomics for complex sample
was reported by Tran et al.,10 wherein
1 043 gene products and over 3 000 protein species were
identified from a human cell lysate with a three-stage separation
system; that analysis required roughly 45 h of analysis time using
a FTICR mass spectrometer and generated ∼20 protein IDs and
∼60 proteoform IDs per hour of mass spectrometer time. In another
study, Ansong and colleagues employed a 4 h UPLC separation of intact
proteins from Salmonella typhimurium. Top-down analysis
identified 563 unique proteins and 1 665 proteoforms.11

Reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)
is the most commonly
used separation method for both peptides and proteins.12−16 However, while RPLC is efficient for the separation of peptides,
protein separations suffer from strong retention on the stationary
phase, which can result in broad peaks and poor peak capacity, time-consuming
washing steps, and short column lifetime.

Capillary electrophoresis
(CE) is an alternative to reverse phase
liquid chromatography that can provide efficient protein separation.17−21 For example, capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) coupled with
FTICR mass spectrometry was applied to analysis of the Escherichia
coli proteome by Smith’s group; that study generated
parent ion mass information for 400–1 000 putative proteins
in a single run.22 Capillary zone electrophoresis
(CZE) is an alternative separation mode that is much easier to automate
than cIEF. Up to 74 glycoforms have been identified and characterized
from a single pharmaceutical glycoprotein using CZE coupled with time-of-flight
MS.19 That work employed a sheathless electrospray
ionization (ESI) interface.

Our group has developed an electrokinetically
pumped sheath-flow
nanospray CE–MS interface that employs electro-osmosis to generate
very low sheath flow rates.23 This sheath-flow
nanospray interface has been applied to a number of bottom-up proteomics
analyses.24−29 We recently demonstrated that this sheath-flow interface could also
be applied for top-down protein analysis.29 Model proteins and several impurities were separated and analyzed
by that system in 12 min. After database searching of the tandem spectra,
three proteins, their post-translational modifications, and one impurity
were identified. Kelleher’s group has very recently reported
the use of the electrokinetically pumped nanospray interface and a
Q-Exactive mass spectrometer to analyze intact proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.30 A total
of 30 proteins were identified in the mass range of 30–80 kDa
during a 25 min CZE separation.

In this work, we coupled CZE
to a high resolution Q-Exactive mass
spectrometer via the electrokinetically pumped sheath-flow electrospray
interface. The Mycobacterium marinum secretome was
separated and analyzed using this platform. We first evaluated the
compatibility of high concentration (70%) acetic acid as sample preparation
buffer with the CZE-MS/MS system using bovine heart cytochrome c as
a model protein. We then applied this system to the analysis secretome
from M. marinum. This experiment requires minimal
sample preparation. We identified 22 gene products and 58 proteoforms
in a single run from the wildtype secretome.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Reagents
All reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless stated otherwise. Formic
acid (FA) and glacial acetic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific
(Pittsburgh, PA). Methanol was purchased from Honeywell Burdick &
Jackson (Wicklow, Ireland). Water was deionized by a NanoPure system
from Thermo Scientific (Marietta, OH). Linear polyacrylamide (LPA)-coated
fused capillary (50 μm i.d. × 150 μm o.d.) was purchased
from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, AZ).

Sample Preparation
The culturing of M. marinum and generation of short-term
culture filtrates have been described
elsewhere.31 A secreted protein fraction
containing approximately 200 μg of protein, as determined by
the bicinchoninic acid assay, was purified by ice-cold acetone precipitation
and resuspension in 50 μL of 70% acetic acid, followed by sonication
for 5 min. The suspension was then centrifuged and the supernatant
was taken for CZE–ESI-MS/MS analysis.

CZE–ESI-MS/MS Analysis
CZE was coupled to a
Q Exactive mass spectrometer for secretome characterization. Electrospray
was generated using an electrokinetically pumped sheath flow through
a nanospray emitter.24 The borosilicate
glass emitter (1.0 mm o.d. × 0.75 mm i.d., 10 cm length) was
pulled with a Sutter instrument P-1000 flaming/brown micropipet puller.
The emitter inner diameter was 7–12 μm. Separation was
performed in a 50 cm long, 50 μm i.d., 150 μm o.d. LPA-coated
fused capillary. The separation buffer was 0.25% (v/v) FA. The electrospray
sheath liquid was 10% (v/v) methanol and 0.1% (v/v) FA. A ∼500
ng protein aliquot (∼6 cm in length) was injected into the
separation capillary by pressure. The separation voltage was 15 kV,
and the electrospray voltage was 1.2 kV.

Mass Spectrometer Operating
Parameters
A Q Exactive
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated with the
S-lens rf level set at 50% and the ion transfer tube temperature at
280 °C. Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap over the m/z 600–2000 range with resolution
of 140 000 at m/z 200. The
three most intense peaks with charge state ≥2 were selected
for fragmentation in the higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD)
cell and detection in the Orbitrap with resolution of 70 000
at m/z 200. The target value for
MS and MS/MS acquisition were 3.00 × 106 and 1.00
× 106, respectively. One microscan was used. The maximum
injection times for MS and MS/MS were both 500 ms. Dynamic exclusion
was 60 s.

Data Analysis
The tandem spectra were decharged and
deisotoped by MS-Deconv (version 0.8.0.7370), followed by database
searching with MS-Align+ software (version 0.7.1.7143).32 Raw files from Q Exactive
were first converted to mzXML files with ReAdW (version 4.3.1). Then,
MS-Deconv (v 0.8.0.7370) was used to generate msalign files with mzXML
files as the input. Finally, the MS-Align+ software (http://bix.ucsd.edu/projects/msalign/) was used for database searching with msalign files as the input.
NCBI protein database for M. marinum including common
contaminates (5 583 protein sequences) was used for database
searching. The parameters for database searching included a maximum
number of modifications (shift number) as 2, mass error tolerance
as 10 ppm, “doOneDaltonCorrection” and “doChargeCorrection”
as false, “cutoffType” as EVALUE, and cutoff as 0.01.
For protein identification, results were filtered with an E-value better than 0.001.

Results and Discussion
Sample
This study employed the proteins derived from
short-term culture filtrates of M. marinum. This
bacterium is closely related to the causative agent of tuberculosis
(M. tuberculosis) and is often used as a model system
for the study of some aspects of that disease,31 specifically ESX-1 protein secretion. We have previously
reported the comparison of both CZE and UPLC for the bottom-up analysis
of this secretome; CZE identified 140 proteins and UPLC identified
134 proteins.25 In both cases, analysis
required roughly 3 h of mass spectrometer time.

Conductivity
of Acetic and Formic Acids
Despite the
success of CZE in bottom-up proteomics and the top-down analysis of
standard proteins, there has been limited work on extension of CZE–ESI-MS/MS
for the top-down characterization of proteins from a complex sample.
One challenge hindering the application of CZE to top-down proteomics
is protein solubilization. A clue to enhanced protein solubilization
comes from reports that employ organic acids to solubilize membrane
proteins.33 As an example, Catherman employed
a high concentration of formic acid to solubilize intact proteins
for LC–MS analysis.12 Unfortunately,
high concentrations of formic acid are not compatible with CZE because
of the high conductivity of formic acid results in high current and
band broadening.

Intriguingly, there is a dramatic difference
in conductivity between acetic and formic acid solutions at concentrations
up to 50% in concentration.34 Published
data cover a limited concentration range. To extend data to higher
concentrations, we determined the conductivity of aqueous acetic acid
and formic acid solutions by applying 6 kV across a 60 cm capillary
filled with acetic acid and formic acid in water at concentrations
ranging from 0.1% to 100% and measuring current. Ohm’s law
and the capillary geometry were used to calculate conductivity, Figure 1 and Table S1 in the Supporting
Information. Across all concentration ranges studied, acetic
acid solutions have much lower conductivity than formic acid. Furthermore,
this data suggests that very high concentrations of acetic acid (>50%)
will have lower conductivity than the 0.25% formic acid running buffer
that is commonly used in CZE analysis of proteins.

Figure 1 Conductivity of aqueous
solutions of acetic and formic acids at
25 °C. Conductivity was determined from the current generated
when applying 6 kV voltage across a 60 cm long, 20 μm i.d. capillary.
Both capillary ends were immersed in 0.1% FA during electrophoresis.
To produce a stable reading, current was recorded 10 s after applying
the voltage. Uncertainties in data are ∼5%. Data points are
connected by straight lines.

We also examined the current in a capillary filled with plugs
of
70% acetic acid in a capillary filled with 0.25% formic acid running
buffer. Plugs of acetic acid between 0 and 27 cm in length were injected
into a 40 cm LPA coated capillary by pressure. The resistance of the
capillary increased linearly with plug length, Figure 2. The resistance across the 40 cm long capillary was 1.4 GΩ
when the capillary was filled with formic acid, and the resistance
increased at a rate of 96 MΩ per centimeter of injected acetic
acid. These resistance values correspond to a conductivity of 1.5
mS/cm for 0.25% formic acid and 0.5 mS/cm for 70% acetic acid; the
conductivity of 70% acetic acid is roughly 3 times lower than the
0.25% formic acid separation buffer. These results suggest that a
modest stacking effect can be expected for samples prepared in 70%
acetic acid used with a 0.25% formic acid separation buffer, due to
the lower conductivity of the 70% acetic acid sample buffer.

Figure 2 Electrical
resistance across a 40 cm long, 50 μm i.d. capillary
filled with plugs of 70% acetic acid. The running buffer was 0.25%
formic acid. Both capillary ends were immersed in 0.25% FA during
electrophoresis after the acetic acid solution was injected. To produce
a stable reading, current was measured 10 s after applying a 16 kV
across the capillary.

Next, to evaluate the compatibility of 70% acetic acid as
sample
buffer with a CZE–MS system, we dissolved about 30 ng of cytochrome
c in 0.25% FA and in 70% acetic acid solutions and analyzed the samples
by CZE–ESI-MS under the same conditions. Triplicate runs were
performed for both sample solutions with an LTQ-XL mass spectrometer.
On average the peak height and widths were the same for the two buffers,
although the variance for both peak height and width were larger in
70% acetic acid. The migration time was consistently 20% longer for
the sample prepared in 70% acetic acid (p < 0.025)
(Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Longer migration time in 70% acetic acid was likely due to the
higher viscosity of the acetic acid solution compared with water.35

Analysis of Secretome from Mycobacterium
marinum
Normalized collision energy (NCE) was first
varied to optimize
the number of protein identifications with a M. marinum WT secreted protein sample. The number of identifications maximized
with NCE near 30%.

Examples of fragmentation for 10 kDa culture
filtrate antigen EsxB (CFP-10) with these three NCEs are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).
Lower NCE resulted in poor fragmentation of the selected precursor
ion, so fewer product ions were generated, causing poor tandem mass
spectra matching. Higher NCE generated tandem spectra that were too
complex for identification. It is worth mentioning that all mass spectrometry
parameters used here were generic, and there was no modification made
to the commercially available Q Exactive mass spectrometer.

We characterized the M. marinum WT secreted protein
sample. A ∼500 ng protein aliquot was injected. As shown in
Figure 3, the separation window was about 35
min, and the peak widths were less than 1 min. A total of 22 proteins
were identified in a single run with NCE was set to 28% (Table 1). The protein identification efficiency (the number
of protein IDs per hour instrument time) is similar to those reported
by Tran et al.,10 who identified 1 043
proteins in 45 h-long LC–MS runs. The size of identified proteins
ranged from several kDa to over 20 kDa. The high-resolution mass spectrometer
resolved isotopic peaks for these relatively low molecular weight
proteins (Figure 3). Most of these proteins
were also identified in our bottom-up study of this secretome. Five
of the detected proteins were not present in our earlier bottom-up
proteomics study of M. marinum’s secretome;
those proteins were all hypothetical proteins.

Figure 3 Base peak electropherogram
of the secreted proteins analyzed by
the CZE–ESI-MS/MS system. Selected peaks were labeled with
identified protein spectra. Superscript numbers indicate the protein
rank in Table 1. The voltage applied was 15
kV for CE separation and 1.2 kV for electrospray. Inserts show parent
ion spectra for proteins centered at the indicated m/z values.

All of the identified proteins had molecular weights less
than
25 kDa. The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer has a resolution of 140 000
(m/z 200), which limits our ability
to identify larger proteins; a mass spectrometer with higher resolving
power will be required to extend our top-down analysis to higher molecular
weight proteins. This low-molecular weight bias likely accounts for
the decreased number of protein identifications compared with our
bottom-up analysis of the M. marinum secretome. Moreover,
the nature of this secretome suggests that large proteins are present
in low abundance, which makes their identification difficult. Also,
there are several small proteins with extremely high abundance, which
can induce ionization suppression of comigrating proteins. On the
basis of the number and size of identified proteins, our system still
has limited separation and identification ability compared to the
LC–MS system.11 This limitation
is caused by the small sample injection amount and the narrow separation
window of capillary electrophoresis compared with HPLC. Protein prefractionation
should improve the results, which will be addressed in future studies.

Top-down proteomics has a distinct advantage in exploring protein
complexity by generating information on proteoforms. We observed 58
proteoforms from 22 gene products, including 16 proteoforms components
of the TypeVII ESX-1 protein secretion system (CFP-10 and ESAT-6),
which is essential for virulence in pathogenic mycobacteria and conserved
in several Gram-positive pathogens. The proteoforms details are listed
in the Supporting Information (Table S3).
For CFP-10, protein isomers were also separated and observed from
the base peak electropherogram showing as small peaks (Figure 3), from which 15 proteoforms were identified. Post-translational
modifications include signal peptide removal, N-terminal methionine
excision, and acetylation. Only the N-terminal acetylation form of
ESAT-6 was found in our database search. However, we confirmed the
existence of its unacetylated form by manually checking the spectrum
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

Quality tandem spectra were obtained with the optimized
collision
energy. An example is shown in Figure 4A, the
best matching spectrum for 10 kDa culture filtrate antigen EsxB (CFP-10)
generated 85 matched fragment ions, and 80 of them were of less than
5 ppm mass error. Also, an N-terminal methionine excision was observed
from the tandem mass spectrum.
