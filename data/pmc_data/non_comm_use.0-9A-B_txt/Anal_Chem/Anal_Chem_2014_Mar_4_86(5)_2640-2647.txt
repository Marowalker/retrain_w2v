An absolute quantitation method for
measuring free human milk oligosaccharides
(HMOs) in milk samples was developed using multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM). To obtain the best sensitivity, the instrument conditions were
optimized to reduce the source and postsource fragmentation prior
to the quadrupole transmission. Fragmentation spectra of HMOs using
collision-induced dissociation were studied to obtain the best characteristic
fragments. At least two MRM transitions were used to quantify and
identify each structure in the same run. The fragment ions corresponded
to the production of singly charged mono-, di-, and trisaccharide
fragments. The sensitivity and accuracy of the quantitation using
MRM were determined, with the detection limit in the femtomole level
and the calibration range spanning over 5 orders of magnitude. Seven
commercial HMO standards were used to create calibration curves and
were used to determine a universal response for all HMOs. The universal
response factor was used to estimate absolute amounts of other structures
and the total oligosaccharide content in milk. The quantitation method
was applied to 20 human milk samples to determine the variations in
HMO concentrations from women classified as secretors and nonsecretors,
a phenotype that can be identified by the concentration of 2′-fucosylation
in their milk.

==== Body
Multiple
reaction monitoring
(MRM) on a triple quadrupole instrument (QqQ) is valued for its ability
to quantify low-abundant compounds in complicated mixtures. As a result,
it is widely used for quantitation of small molecules such as drugs1,2 and metabolites,3,4 and even larger biomolecules such
as proteins, which are digested to peptides.5−7 However, its
application to complicated and labile biomolecules such as oligosaccharides
and glycoconjugates is still limited.8−10 One challenge is that
the masses of oligosaccharides can be large, up to 5000 Da. The quadrupoles
typically have limited transmission mass ranges such that large m/z ions are not effectively transmitted.
Large peptides of that size are typically neglected in MRM in favor
of smaller peptides from the same proteins; however, this option is
not possible with glycans. A more practical concern is that commercial
QqQ are most often optimized for peptides and small robust analytes,
while oligosaccharides tend to fragment more readily during ionization
and may not be well-represented by their quasimolecular ions.

Human milk is an important source for bioactive oligosaccharides
and glycoconjugates. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are the third
most abundant group of compounds after lactose and fat, with as much
as 5–23 g/L in milk.11−13 Interestingly, HMOs are produced
by mothers not for direct nourishment of their infants,14 but instead have other biological functions
such as inhibiting the binding of pathogens, stimulating the growth
of commensal intestinal bacterial, and promoting postnatal brain development.13,15−17 To date, over 200 HMOs have been reported,18−21 and it has been found that HMO structures are related to their biological
functions. For example, lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and
lacto-N-fucopentaose II and III (LNFP-II, III) were
found to reduce Entamoeba histolytica attachment and cytotoxicity, while lacto-N-fucopentaose
I (LNFP-I), an isomer of LNFP-II and LNFP-III, had no such effects.22 It has also been found that specific bifidobacterial
strains, commensal
bacteria found in the gut of healthy infants, selectively consumed
distinct HMO structures.23 For these reasons,
accurate and sensitive quantitation methods capable of monitoring
HMO structures would be very useful for functional studies.

The absolute quantitation of HMOs is challenging due to the lack
of standards and the difficulty in achieving complete chromatographic
resolution of individual structures. High-performance anion-exchange
chromatography (HPAEC) coupled with a pulsed amperometric detector
(PAD) is a common technique for oligosaccharide quantitation.24−27 HPLC separation in combination with spectrophotometric detection
is also available for derivatized oligosaccharides.28−31 However, none of these detection
methods are structural selective, and the quantitation depends on
effective chromatographic separation. Multiple reaction monitoring
on a QqQ provides the possibility of a robust label-free method for
quantitation. Its detection can also be structure-selective. However,
it has not been widely used to monitor free oligosaccharides in milk.
One exception is a very recent example employing negative mode MRM
for the absolute quantitation for six acidic bovine milk oligosaccharides
(BMO) using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC).32 Low-femtomole detection limits, which are 3
orders of magnitude lower than those of the PAD detector, illustrated
the value of MRM for quantifying oligosaccharides. The only other
example employed negative mode MRM to determine eight soluble milk
oligosaccharides in rat serum using normal phase liquid chromatography.33

In this study, we present a comprehensive
MRM analysis of HMOs.
HMOs differ from other milk oligosaccharides such as BMOs in terms
of their structural complexity and diversity and in their natural
abundances.19,20,34 HMOs are more abundant than BMOs and have a much higher degree of
fucosylation than BMOs. Conversely, BMOs have a much higher degree
of sialylation. Furthermore, the mass spectrometry conditions were
optimized particularly for free oligosaccharides to achieve high MRM
sensitivity, thus enabling the detection of HMO over a wider dynamic
range. The optimized method was then applied to study the variation
in HMO concentrations in milk collected from healthy mothers. It is
known that HMO profiles are greatly affected by the mother’s
secretor phenotype, which is encoded by the fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene and causes the secretion of α(1–2)
fucosylation.35 This MRM method was then
used to examine the absolute concentrations of individual structures
to determine the variation in α(1–2) fucosylation and
the total HMO content between mothers of different secretor phenotypes.

Experimental
Procedures
A brief description of the experimental procedures
is given here.
A more detailed description of the materials and methods used can
be found in the Supporting Information.

Samples
and Materials
Milk oligosaccharide standards,
lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), lacto-N-fucopentaose
I (LNFP-I), sialyllacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc), 3′-sialyllactose
(3′-SL), and 6′-sialyllactose (6′-SL), 2′-fucosyllactose
(2′-FL), and lacto-N-hexaose (LNH) were purchased
to build the standard calibration curves. Milk samples were obtained
from 20 healthy women who gave birth to healthy full term infants
enrolled in the UC Davis Foods for Health Institute lactation study.
The participants’ secretor statuses were determined by measuring
specific fucosylated HMO structures in their milk as previously described.36 Ten secretor and 10 nonsecretor participants
were chosen for this study.

Sample Preparation
HMOs were extracted
from milk samples
and reduced using the method described previously.18,36 Briefly, 100 μL of raw milk was defatted via centrifuge followed
by an ethanol precipitation. The defatted samples were reduced using
NaBH4 at 65 °C water bath for 1.5 h followed by a
solid phase extraction (SPE) cleanup using graphitized carbon cartridges.
The lyophilized samples were reconstituted in 100 μL of Nanopure
water and diluted by 20-folds for MS analysis. Oligosaccharide standards
were also reduced using NaBH4. The lyophilized reduced
oligosaccharide standards were weighed using a microbalance (Mettler
Toledo, XP26), reconstituted, and diluted to create standard calibration
curves. A standard addition experiment was performed for one of the
milk samples by adding varying amount of HMO standards into the 20×
diluted extracted milk oligosaccharide sample.

LC–ESI-MS Analysis
Human milk oligosaccharides
were quantified using an Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole equipped with
an Agilent 1290 infinity LC system, and a Thermo 100 × 2.1 mm
Hypercarb column with a 10 × 2.1 mm Hypercarb precolumn (particle
size of 3 μm for both columns). A 55 min LC separation was performed
using a binary gradient at 0.2 mL/min flow rate: solvent A of 3% acetonitrile,
0.1% formic acid; solvent B of 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid
in Nanopure water (v/v). For the initial optimization of the mass
analyzer, pure standards were ran on fast LC gradients (10 min) employing
the same solvent composition as described.

The MS was operated
in positive mode. The first and third quadrupoles were operated at
unit resolution. The following parameters were optimized for oligosaccharide
analysis: drying gas temperature and sheath gas temperature 150 °C,
drying gas flow rate 11 L/min, sheath gas flow rate 7 L/min, nebulizer
pressure 25 psi, capillary voltage 1800 V, fragmentor voltage 250
V; rf voltage amplitudes of high-pressure and low-pressure ion funnels
are 100 and 60 V, respectively.

Statistical Analysis
The box-and-whisker plot and statistic
tests were performed in JMP 10.0 statistical software. One-tailed
Student t test (α = 0.05) was used to compare
the means of secretor and nonsecretor groups. Data sets were tested
for homoscedasticity using Bartlett tests, with an α value of
0.05. Nonhomoscedastic distributions were transformed using logarithmic
functions to meet assumptions for parametric testing. Distributions
that were not normal or homoscedastic were analyzed by a nonparametric
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon method.

Results and Discussion
A method for the accurate absolute quantitation of free oligosaccharides
using MRM was developed by first optimizing ionization conditions
for oligosaccharides. The fragmentation conditions under collision-induced
dissociation (CID) were also optimized, and the common fragments were
determined. The MS instrument parameters required further optimization
for HMOs because they are structurally labile compared to metabolites
and peptides. Chromatographic separation of reduced HMOs was performed
with porous graphitized carbon (PGC). Each HMO compound was identified
on the basis of its characteristic fragments and its elution time
using a previously developed annotated HMO library.19,20

Method
Optimization
Minimization of In-Source and Postsource
Fragmentation
Oligosaccharides are biomolecules consisting
of monosaccharides linked
via glycosidic bonds.19 Triple quadrupole
MS (QqQ) has been primarily applied to small metabolites2,37 and peptides,38,39 which tend to be intrinsically
more stable than oligosaccharides under most common ionization techniques.
Commercial instruments are often optimized for small molecules and
peptides but not for oligosaccharides. An MS scan of the LNT standard
using the manufacturer default setting (Figure 1a) shows that the quasimolecular ions degrade into fragments prior
to and during source extraction resulting in low MRM sensitivity.

Figure 1 Response
of the method to LNT. (a) The manufacturer default conditions
for peptides produced a large amount of unintended LNT fragments (m/z 366) in the MS scan mode. (b) After
the instrument optimization, the fragment ion signal was diminished
and the quasimolecular ion was increased: blue squares, GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine); blue circles, Glc (glucose); yellow
circles, Gal (galactose).

To increase the specificity and
sensitivity of the detection, minimizing
fragmentation during ion transmission and prior to the collision-induced
dissociation is necessary. While the optimization process is instrument-specific
the principle is the same for all instruments, i.e., decrease the
fragmentation while maintaining quasimolecular ion abundances. Furthermore,
the dual ion funnel feature makes this instrument still unique among
triple quadrupole instruments making the discussion of the optimization
highly relevant. Several parameters decrease the internal energy of
the ion for this instrument including the source gas temperature and
flow, nebulizer voltage, capillary voltage, fragmentor voltage, and
dual ion funnel voltages. These parameters were optimized using oligosaccharide
standards. Both reduced and unreduced compounds were examined and
yielded similar responses. The results with LNT are shown as representative
of the entire effort. Optimization of the gas temperature, fragmentor
voltage, and the dual ion funnel voltage were most effective in increasing
the quasimolecular ion as illustrated in Figure 2. Generally, higher gas temperature during electrospray ionization
(ESI) decreases the formation of cluster ions, but may increase the
internal energy of the ion and result in in-source fragmentation.
Figure 2a shows that the optimum temperature
is around 150 °C for producing the highest quasimolecular signal.

Figure 2 Optimization
of collision conditions with LNT. (a) The drying gas
and sheath gas were maintained at the same temperature. The optimal
temperature at 150 °C provides the strongest quasimolecular ion
signal. (b) Fragmentor voltage of 250 V provides the lowest degree
of fragmentation and the strongest quasimolecular ion signal; 250
V is the minimum setting in this instrument. (c) The rf amplitude
of the low-pressure ion funnel at 60 V provides the strongest quasimolecular
ion signal. (d) The rf amplitude of the high ion funnel at 100 V provides
the lowest degree of fragmentation. The optimum settings are thus
100 and 60 V for the high-pressure and low-pressure ion funnels, respectively.
Red triangle: the symbol corresponds to the ratio of the quasimolecular
ion (m/z 708) counts to the total
ion counts. Blue diamond: the symbol corresponds to the ratio of the
fragment ion (m/z 366) counts to
the quasimolecular ion (m/z 708)
counts. Instrument optimization of the low-pressure ion funnel was
performed with rf amplitude at 40 (black triangles), 60 (green circles),
and 80 V (red squares), respectively.

The fragmentor voltage is the voltage placed at the exit
of the
capillary to transmit ions into the mass analyzer. Higher voltages
facilitate the transmission, but can also cause in-source CID. As
shown in Figure 2b, a fragmentor voltage of
250 V provides the least fragmentation and thus the highest quasimolecular
ion signal. However, 250 V is the minimum setting on this instrument
and it is possible that lower voltages may still yield higher molecular
ion abundances. The triple quadrupole used in this analysis was equipped
with two ion funnels placed consecutively to focus and transmit ions
into the MS with high efficiency. The ion funnel consists of a series
of concentric electrodes with an applied radio frequency (rf) to compress
the ion cloud, and a dc electrical field to transmit ions into the
mass analyzers.40,41 The ion funnels are used under
relatively high pressures. An appropriate
level of neutral gas inside the funnels is beneficial for ion confinement
through collisional cooling; however, the gas can also increase the
potential for unintended CID. The suggested manufacturer conditions
involved pressures of 7–14 Torr (first ion funnel, also called
high-pressure ion funnel) and 1–3 Torr (second ion funnel,
also called low-pressure ion funnel). Under these conditions, large
amounts of postsource fragmentation were found using the default rf
amplitudes. Decreasing the rf levels was found to yield more abundant
oligosaccharide quasimolecular ions. As shown in Figure 2c, the rf amplitude of 100–150 V for the first funnel
and 60 V for the second ion funnel gave the strongest quasimolecular
ion signal. Consequently, the rf amplitudes of 100 and 60 V, respectively,
were used for the analysis. Under the optimized conditions, the instrument
yielded the strongest quasimolecular ion with the least amount of
fragmentation (Figure 1b).

Multiple Reaction
Monitoring of Human Milk Oligosaccharides
MRM Transitions for HMOs
The MRM method requires intense
and reproducible fragment ions in order to achieve high specificity
and sensitivity. HMO fragmentations employing CID were studied to
obtain the optimum MRM transitions for HMO quantitation. The tandem
MS of several compounds are provided for illustrative purposes in Supporting Information Figure S-1. The most abundant
fragment ions of protonated HMO precursor were small mono-, di-, and
some trisaccharide fragments including m/z 366.2 (GlcNAc–Gal), 204.1 (N-acetylglucosamine,
GlcNAc), 183.1 (glucose, Glc, reducing end), 512.2 (Fuc–GlcNAc–Gal),
292.1 (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), and 657.1
(Neu5Ac–GlcNAc–Gal). At least two of these abundant
fragment ions were monitored for each compound. The collision energy
was optimized for composition to yield the highest response. The collision
energy was then applied to a specific mass eluting at a specific time.
As listed in Supporting Information Table
S-1, 42 HMOs, corresponding to 32 distinct masses were monitored.
This represents a large fraction of the total HMOs in individuals
corresponding to over 95% of the abundances.36

Dynamic MRMs
MRM detects multiple transitions sequentially
in one duty cycle. Transitions monitored within a single duty cycle
are called concurrent transitions. The dwell time and cycle time are
two important parameters in an MRM method. The cycle time is the time
spent monitoring all transitions during one duty cycle, and the dwell
time is the time spent on acquiring one specific MRM transition within
each duty cycle. A long cycle time will result in poor LC peak sampling
and thus poor data quality, while a short dwell time will result in
poor signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). As the number of concurrent MRM
transitions increase, either the cycle time needs to be increased
resulting in poor data quality or the dwell time needs to be decreased
resulting in poor S/N. In order to reduce the number of concurrent
transitions, a dynamic MRM method was employed whereby specific transitions
are only monitored at specific times, i.e., when the compound elutes.
The cycle time of the dynamic MRM method was set in these analyses
to 500 ms with the minimum and maximum dwell times of 15.33 and 248.63
ms, respectively, resulting in between 30 and 60 points across a chromatographic
peak. Figure 3 shows the dynamic MRM transitions
monitored for a pooled HMO sample. The abundant HMOs were annotated
in Figure 3a. The lower abundant HMOs were
annotated in Figure 3b. The extracted ion chromatograms
are provided separately in Supporting Information Figure S-2. The isomers were well-resolved using the PGC stationary
phase. Homologues that coelute have different masses and were readily
distinguished with MS.

circles, Glc (glucose); yellow circles, Gal (galactose); blue squares,
GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine); yellow squares, GalNAc
(N-acetylgalactosamine); red triangles, Fuc (fucose);
purple diamonds, Neu5Ac (N-acetylneuraminic acid).

Limits of Detection and
Quantitation
Limits of detection
and the range of quantitation were studied for the standard samples,
which include two neutral (LNT and LNH), two fucosylated (2′-FL
and LNFP-I), and three sialylated HMOs (6′-SL, 3′-SL,
and LSTc). The limits of detection (LOD, S/N ≥ 3) for these
compounds were at low-femtomole levels (10–150 fmol), and the
limits of quantitation (LOQ, S/N ≥ 6) were at high-femtomole
levels (100–1500 fmol) (Table 1). The
LOD for the neutral HMOs were slightly better than for the sialylated
HMOs. The reason may be due to the lower ionization efficiency of
sialylated species or a greater degree of postsource fragmentation
compared to the neutral compounds in positive mode ESI.42 The HMOs show good linearity (R2 > 0.99 for over 2 orders of magnitude); however,
quantitation
can be performed over 5 orders of magnitude using a quadratic calibration
curve (0.001–500 μg/mL, Supporting
Information Figures S-3 and S-4).

HMO Response Factor
The standard calibration curves
for seven HMO standards, LNT, 2′-FL, LNFP-I, LNH, 6′-SL,
LSTc, and 3′-SL, are illustrated in Supporting
Information Figure S-3. With the exception of LNT and 3′-SL,
the response factors (the slopes of the standard calibration curves)
of the HMOs are similar, within a factor of 2 (Table 2). The response factor for LNT is higher compared to 2′-FL,
LNFP-I, LNH, 6′-SL, and LSTc, while the response factor of
3′-SL is the lowest. Variations in ionization efficiencies
and fragmentation efficiencies are two possible reasons for these
differences. However, because HMO standards are very expensive and
often unavailable, a universal response factor to quantify each component
and the total HMO content would be desirable. To this end, a linear
regression equation, y = 6966.4x – 1752.6, was created to correlate the MRM responses (y, ion counts) to the HMO concentration (x, μg/mL) by averaging the slopes and y-intercepts
of the linear regression equations using the seven HMO standards.

b Concentration was obtained using
specific standard calibration curves. The linear regression equations
used were as follows: (2′-FL) y = 8082x + 20297, R2 = 0.996; (LNFP-I) y = 7851x – 452, R2 = 1.000; (LNT) y = 12880x – 14067, R2 = 1.000; (LNH) y = 6710x – 547, R2 = 1.000; (3′-SL) y = 1895x – 564, R2 = 0.999;
(6′-SL) y = 5686x –
795, R2 = 1.000; (LSTc) y = 4615x – 218, R2 = 1.000; nonsec., milk from nonsecretor mothers; sec., milk from
secretor mothers.

was obtained using
the average linear regression equation, y = 6966.4x – 1752.6, fitted to the 0.8–100 μg/mL
concentration window.

LNDFH, lacto-N-difucohexaose; MFLNH, monofucosyllacto-N-hexaose; TFLNH, trifucosyllacto-N-hexaose.

This equation was then used
to quantify the total HMO content of
a pooled HMO sample. The pooled HMO sample was collected and extracted
from milks of several mothers. Milligrams of extracted HMOs were then
reduced, lyophilized, weighed using a microbalance, reconstituted
in Nanopure water, and analyzed. Using this average linear regression
equation, the total HMO content was determined to be 2.2 ± 0.1
(SE) mg/mL compared to the actual sample value of 2.0 mg/mL. The average
response factor can therefore be used to obtain the total quantity
of HMO in milk. The average response factor was evaluated for each
individual compound. For the group of compounds that were used to
obtain the average response factor, the difference of concentration
using two different linear regression equations was within ±20%
for most of the standards. For LNT, the compound was overestimated
by 80%, whereas 3′-SL was underestimated by 70% as shown in
Table 2. Nonetheless, using the average response
factor produces sufficiently accurate result for each individual compound.

Validation of Matrix Effect with Standard Addition
To evaluate
the matrix effect in this ESI LC–MS experiment,
standard additions were performed by adding varying concentrations
of pure HMO standards into a pooled HMO sample. Standard addition
takes the matrix effect into account and may provide more accurate
values compared to a standard curve. As illustrated in Table 1, the concentrations obtained using these two different
methods were found to differ by only ±10% except for 3′-SL
(−38%). Ion suppression and ion enhancement are the two major
reasons for recovery rate higher and lower than 100%, respectively.
Nevertheless, the result shows that the matrix effect is not a major
source of error in our experiments.

Quantitation of HMO in
Biological Samples
Absolute Quantitation of HMOs in Human Milk
To evaluate
the variation in absolute HMO concentrations in a general population,
the method was applied to milk samples collected from 20 mothers on
day 35 postpartum. The absolute amounts of 2′-FL, LNT, LNFP-I,
3′-SL, 6′-SL, and LSTc in these 20 milk samples were
determined (Table 2) using the standard calibration
curves depicted in Supporting Information Figure S-3. Average concentrations of LNT and 2′-FL were
0.97 ± 0.56 and 1.5 ± 1.4 μg/mL, respectively, and
are very close to previously reported values.43,44 The standard deviation reflects the biological diversity in these
20 samples. The LNFP-I, 3′-SL, 6′-SL, and LSTc concentrations
measured by our LC–MS method were 20%–65% lower than
that for HPAEC-PAD,44 well within biological
variations. The LNFP-I concentration reported previously using single-quadrupole
LC–MS using abundances and a calibration curve yielded a range
of 0.001–1.80 mg/mL,43 which includes
our value 0.26 ± 0.28 mg/mL (mean ± SD).

HMO Abundance
and Secretor Status
It is known that
the secretor status of the mother largely influences her HMO profile.36,44,45 Milk from secretor mothers contains
a higher percentage of α(1–2)-fucose in compounds such
as 2′-FL and LNFP-I as a consequence of the fucosyltransferase
2 (FUT2) gene in the epithelial cells. Indeed, we
find the abundances of 2′-FL and LNFP-I are significantly higher
in secretors (2′-FL, 3.0 mg/mL; LNFP-, 0.48 mg/mL) than in
nonsecretors (2′-FL, 0.58 mg/mL; LNFP-I, 0.10 mg/mL) (Figure 4 and Table 2). We have previously
suggested to use these compounds to phenotype the mother based on
her milk HMO.36 The results depicted in
Figure 4, parts a and b, however, show that
a single compound may be insufficient to completely separate secretors
from nonsecretors. For example, there are two nonsecretor mothers
in Figure 4a (mothers D1036 and D1041) who
produced 2′-FL abundances of the same magnitude as the secretor
mothers; however, the fraction of all HMOs with α(1–2)-fucose
is lower than those for secretor mothers. For other abundant oligosaccharides
such as LNT, LNH, 3′-SL, 6′-SL, and LSTc, there appears
no significant difference between the two phenotypes (Figure 4c–g).

Figure 4 Box-and-whisker diagrams for secretor
mothers (S) and nonsecretor
mothers (N) reveal that nonsecretor mothers produce lower amounts
of 2′-FL (P < 0.001) and LNFP-I (P = 0.004) than secretor mothers. However, there are some
outliers who still produce similar amounts of 2′-FL or/and
LNFP-I with secretor mothers, while their total α(1–2)
fucosylation is still at relatively low level. The total HMO content
produced by nonsecretor mothers is also lower (P =
0.014, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test) than that of secretor
mothers using the nonparametric test. (a) 2′-FL. (b) LNFP-I.
(c) LNT. (d) LNH. (e) 6′-SL. (f) 3′-SL. (g) LSTc. (h)
Total HMO content. Reported P-values are from one-tail
Student t test unless specified.

The concentrations for the individual compounds, also the
total
HMO content, from the universal response factors are listed in Table 2. The standard deviations in this table represent
the biological variation. The total amounts of HMOs were found to
be higher in the secretor (6.8 ± 0.7 mg/mL) compared to the nonsecretor
mothers (5.1 ± 1.6 mg/mL). The difference was statistically significant
(Figure 4h, P = 0.014 from
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test) and consistent with a recent
report on Gambian mothers.36 Furthermore,
the biological variation in total HMO content among nonsecretor mothers
is larger than among secretor mothers, which was also found for Gambian
mothers.36

Conclusions
MRM is highly suited for the absolute quantitation of oligosaccharides,
specifically human milk oligosaccharides. The limit of quantitation
is approximately in the high-femtomole level with the quantitation
range spanning 5 orders of magnitude. The small number of standards
is typical in for oligosaccharides, because the syntheses of specific
structures, even as small as those found in milk, remain a major task.
This issue will not soon be solved. We therefore examined the use
of a universal response factor based on the average of seven compounds.
Accurate absolute quantitation, while desirable, is not often always
needed. For many studies such as those for discovering markers of
health or diseases states, sample sets are often matched and analyzed
simultaneously. Relative quantitation is therefore generally sufficient.
The advantage of absolute quantitation is that the value is generally
independent of the method. MRM is attractive nonetheless because it
provides both relative quantitation and, when standards are available,
absolute quantitation. A general response factor for HMO may be helpful
because it provides a good approximate value for a component even
when standards are not available but provide values that can be directly
compared for relative quantitation. A general response factor is also
useful for obtaining accurate values for the total amounts of HMOs.
This method will be of general use in oligosaccharide analyses but
specifically in studying the bioactivity of HMOs.
