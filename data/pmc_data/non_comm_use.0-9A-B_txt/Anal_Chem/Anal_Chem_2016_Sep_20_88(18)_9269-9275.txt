Parathyroid hormone-related
peptide (PTHrP) is recognized as the
major causative agent of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM).
The paraneoplastic PTHrP has also been implicated in tumor progression
and metastasis of many human cancers. Conventional PTHrP detection
methods like immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) lack the sensitivity required
to measure target peptide levels prior to the development of hypercalcemia.
In general, sensitive, multiplexed peptide measurement by immunoassay
represents challenges that we address in this paper. We describe here
the first ultrasensitive multiplexed peptide assay to measure intact
PTHrP 1-173 as well as circulating N-terminal and C-terminal peptide
fragments. This versatile approach should apply to almost any collection
of peptides that are long enough to present binding sites for two
antibodies. To target PTHrP, we employed a microfluidic immunoarray
featuring a chamber for online capture of the peptides from serum
onto magnetic beads decorated with massive numbers of peptide-specific
antibodies and enzyme labels. Magnetic bead-peptide conjugates were
then washed and sent to a detection chamber housing an antibody-modified
8-electrode array fabricated by inkjet printing of gold nanoparticles.
Limits of detection (LODs) of 150 aM (∼1000-fold lower than
IRMA) in 5 μL of serum were achieved for simultaneous detection
of PTHrP isoforms and peptide fragments in 30 min. Good correlation
for patient samples was found with IRMA (n = 57); r2 = 0.99 assaying PTHrP 1-86 equiv fragments.
Analysis by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot gave an
area under the curve of 0.96, 80–83% clinical sensitivity,
and 96–100% clinical specificity. Results suggest that PTHrP1-173
isoform and its short C-terminal fragments are the predominant circulating
forms of PTHrP. This new ultrasensitive, multiplexed assay for PTHrP
and fragments is promising for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and
therapeutic monitoring from early to advanced stage cancer patients
and to examine underlying mechanisms of PTHrP overproduction.

==== Body
Parathyroid
hormone (PTH)-like
factor was first postulated by Albright over 60 years ago1 as a humoral factor responsible for development
of hypercalcemia in cancer patients and later described as humoral
hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM).2 The
true nature of this PTH-like factor remained elusive since it escaped
detection by immunoassays using antibodies raised against PTH3,4 but could be detected in bioassays using PTH receptor.5,6 This led to cloning and characterization of this PTH-like factor
now known as parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP)7,8 and to development of specific immunoassays.9,10

Human PTHrP has three isoforms of 139, 141, and 173 amino acids
and is widely expressed in normal and cancerous human tissues.11,12 All isoforms have identical sequences through residue 139 and undergo
post-translational cleavage generating N-terminal, midregion, and
C-terminal peptides with distinct physiological functions. PTHrP exerts
PTH-like actions in bone and kidney by binding and activating the
guanylyl nucleotide-binding (G) protein-linked receptor (PTH1R) causing
hypercalcemia.13,14

Distinct from PTH, PTHrP
acts as endocrine, autocrine, paracrine,
or intracrine factor in a vast range of important physiological roles
including skeletal development, placental calcium transport, muscle
relaxation, and mammary gland development.15,16 Circulating levels of PTHrP correlate with disease progression in
cancers including breast, prostate, melanoma,17−20 and bone metastasis.21−23 Currently PTHrP can only be detected in the blood when hypercalcemia
develops,9,10 when there is ∼50% chance of mortality
in 30 days.24 Thus, existing PTHrP assays
are limited to confirming the humoral origin of hypercalcemia but
cannot provide early detection of PTHrP-producing tumors, which requires
assays with much higher sensitivity.

Peptides have been particularly
difficult targets for ultrasensitive
multiplexed immunoassays. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),25 immunofluorometric assays (IFMA),26 and mass spectrometry27,28 can be used to measure PTHrP but have limits of detection (LOD)
in the picomolar range that are not low enough to measure serum PTHrP
representative of early stage cancers. In addition, immunoradiometric
(IRMA) and radioimmunoassay assays (RIA)9,10,29 commonly used for PTHrP employ high energy isotopes
such as 125I that pose health hazards and have short shelf-lives.28,30 None of these assays measure specific PTHrP isoforms and in particular
the human specific PTHrP 1-173 isoform. These assays mostly target
the 1-86 peptide fragment. IRMA and RIA have LODs ranging from 0.3
to 4 pM,29,31,32 ELISA (Elabscience
Biotechnology) 0.5 pM,25 IFMA 0.5 pM,26 and mass spectrometry 10 pM.28 Furthermore, these assays lack multiplexing capability
and detect only a single PTHrP isoform.

Multiplexed assays have
been developed for other peptides. Zhong
et al.33 reported an electrochemical multiplex
immunoassay using liposomes which contained electrochemically active
molecules as signal enhancers for simultaneous detection of neuron-specific
enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP). This immunoassay
has one of the best non-PTHrP peptide LODs so far, 10 pg/mL (picomolar
range) for ProGRP and 0.18 ng/mL (nanomolar range) for NSE. Using
peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with stable isotope dilution
mass spectrometry (SISCAPA-MRM), Kuhn et al.34 developed a multiplexed assay for peptides troponin I (cTnI) and
interleukin-33 (IL-33) trypsin-digested peptide standards. LODs of
2.5 μg/L (83 pM) for IL-33 Pep-1 and 1.0 μg/L (33 pM)
for IL-33 Pep-2 were achieved. However, these methods applied to PTHrP
would still be expected to have insufficient LODs for early cancer
diagnostics.

In this paper, we describe the first ultrasensitive
immunoarray
to detect PTHrP 1-173 and smaller peptide fragments using a novel
semiautomated microfluidic device that we previously developed for
full proteins.35 The microfluidic system
delivers samples to a capture chamber where massively enzyme-labeled
magnetic beads equipped with multiple antibodies capture target peptides.
These beads are washed and delivered to an 8-sensor inkjet printed
4 nm gold nanoparticle immunoarray36 decorated
with a second set of antibodies that recognize and bind bead-bound
target peptides. Peptides are measured simultaneously by activation
of enzyme labels and electrochemical detection. Exquisite LODs and
sensitivities are achieved because of these design factors: (1) highly
efficient capture of target peptides from the samples onto magnetic
beads with 120 000 ± 8 000 antibodies, (2) the
sensors see only the beads and never contact the full sample to limit
nonspecific binding, and (3) 250 000 ± 15 000 HRP
detection labels are present on each magnetic bead. The number antibodies
and enzyme labels (HRP) on the magnetic beads are comparable to those
previously reported.36 Intact PTHrP isoforms
as well as N- and C-terminal fragments were detected simultaneously
in serum with ultralow LODs of 150 aM, 1000-fold lower than commercial
PTHrP assays. Good correlation between microfluidic immunoarray and
IRMA results in cancer patient serum were found. Statistical analysis
of limited patient sample data predicts good cancer diagnostic potential,
with 80–83% sensitivity (true positive rate) and 96–100%
specificity (0−4% false positive rate).

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Serum Samples
Chemicals and materials
are listed in the Supporting Information. Human serum samples from cancer patients with solid tumors and
healthy individuals were obtained from McGill University Health Center
Biorepository. Blood was drawn in regular tubes, which were put on
ice immediately, separated within 60 min, aliquoted, and stored at
−80 °C prior to assay. The samples were stored for no
longer than 12 months prior to assay (Table S1). All samples used in this study were acquired under a McGill University
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol, and informed consent
was obtained from all study participants.

PTHrP Peptides and Antibodies
PTHrP 1-173 was produced
from cDNA encoding PTHrP 1-173. Human PTHrP fragments 1-33, 151-169,
140-173 were from Sheldon Biotechnology Center (McGill University,
CA). Human recombinant PTHrP 1-86 was from Bachem (Torrance, CA, catalog
no. H-9815). Monoclonal antibodies M45 (IgM) and PA158 (IgG) were
raised against PTHrP1-33; monoclonal antibody PA104 (IgG) was raised
against PTHrP 140-173; monoclonal antibody PA6 (IgG) was raised against
PTHrP 151-169, PA104, PA158.37 Polyclonal
antibodies against human PTHrP 1-173 (IgY lots 3103 and 3104 were
raised in chicken and purified commercially (Genway Biotech, San Diego,
CA).

Stock concentration of peptide standards (200–500
ng for 1-33, 151-169, 140-173, and 1-173 and PTHrP 1-86 were first
diluted in water or PBS buffer pH 7.4 to 50 pM and stored at −80
°C (according to the manufacturer’s specifications). The
antibodies were reconstituted in PBS buffer pH 7.4 down to the working
concentration and stored at −80 °C. The peptides and antibodies
were stable for 12 months. On assay days, one vial of 50 pM peptide
standard was then diluted to 1 pM followed by serial dilution in 5×
diluted calf serum in PBS buffer pH 7.4. The diluted standards were
used the same day they were prepared and any left-over standards were
discarded. In all the calibration curves, 5× diluted calf serum
was employed as the assay diluent for serial dilutions. Electrode
surface area was calculated by cycling the gold arrays in 0.18 M H2SO4 between 1.5 V and −0.2 V at 100 mV s–1 (see Supporting Information). Current density was used for quantitation of the standards. The
peak height (I, nA) was divided by the surface area
of the electrode to yield the current density that was plotted against
the concentration of the peptide fragments. Log fitting was used to
plot the data.

Array Fabrication
Immunosensor arrays
were inkjet printed
from 4 nm dodecanethiol-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on Kapton film
as previously described36 (see the Supporting Information). After monoclonal antibodies
(Ab1) were attached to sensors, they were washed with PBS-T20
and incubated with 2% BSA to minimize nonspecific binding (NSB) (see
the Supporting Information). Arrays were
then fitted into the detection chamber. Multiple horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) and antibodies (Ab2) were attached onto 1 μm
magnetic beads (HRP-MB-Ab2) as previously described36b (Table S2).

Detection
of PTHrP Isoforms and Fragments
The microfluidic
immunoassay system (Figure 1)35 was conditioned by flowing
PBS-T20 for 4 min before and after each standard run to minimize NSB
and carry-over effect. HRP-MB-Ab2 beads were dispersed
in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and injected into the capture chamber followed
by injection of sample or PTHrP standard in 5× diluted calf serum
(Figure S1). HRP-MB-Ab2 beads
were held in the capture chamber with a magnet while the sample was
injected. For simultaneous multiplexed detection of peptides, mixed
HRP-MB-Ab2 beads for each peptide in PBS buffer were injected
into the capture chamber followed by injection of sample or standard
mixtures. Flow was stopped, magnet removed, and capture chamber stirred
30 min for peptide capture by HRP-MB-Ab2.

Figure 1 Immunoarray with online
peptide capture: (A) microfluidic device
and (B) detection pathway.

The resulting beads were washed with PBS-T20, the magnet
removed,
and flow switched to transport peptide-Ab2-MB-HRP beads
into the detection chamber. Flow was stopped for 15 min to allow sensors
to capture peptide-bead conjugates. After washing, amperometric detection
at −0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl was enabled by flowing 1 mM hydroquinone
+ 0.1 mM H2O2 through the detection chamber.36 A commercial IRMA immunoassay was used as a
reference method (see the Supporting Information). Total assay time is ∼50 min (30 min incubation in the capture
chamber; 15 min incubation in the detection chamber; 5 min total wash
time). However, since incubation of sample 1 in the detection chamber
and incubation of sample 2 in the capture chamber can be done simultaneously
after the first standard run, the total cycle time for the analysis
is 30 min. Up to 8 different peptide fragments can be assayed simultaneously.

Results
Single Peptide Detection
PTHrP undergoes post-translational
cleavage at lysine or arginine to yield N-terminal, midregion, and
C-terminal peptide fragments.7,10 We first designed single
peptide assays for intact PTHrP 1-173, N-terminal (1-33 and 1-86)
and C-terminal fragments (151-169 and 140-173). PA158, PA6, and PA104
were employed as capture antibodies on the sensors while M45, IgY3103,
and IgY3104 were attached onto magnetic beads as detection antibodies
(Table S2 and Figure S2). Calf serum diluted 5× in PBS pH 7.4, a good surrogate
for human serum in immunoassays,38 was
employed as peptide standards diluent. Calf serum as reported by the
manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich) has a total protein concentration of
5.5–8.0%, which is similar to human serum (4.0–9.0%).
Analytical performance of the immunoassay was evaluated including
its linearity, precision (intra-assay and interassay), sensitivity,
specificity, limit of detection, carry-over effect, and method comparison
using IRMA (Figure S3 and Table S3).

Calibrations for peptide fragments are shown
in Figure 2. Signals
for peptide-free controls result from residual NSB of magnetic beads
and direct reduction of H2O2. Peaks increased
linearly with log C for peptide fragments from 150
aM to 7 pM. LODs measured as 3-SDs above control were 150–170
aM (3–5 fg/mL) for all peptides (Table S4 and Figure S4). LODs were 1000-fold
better than those of commercial IRMA and ELISA kits (0.3–4
pM). Good reproducibility is indicated by small error bars (Figure 2). Sensitivities
(as slopes of calibration plots) were 1.98–2.12 μA cm–2 [log C]−1 for
1-33, 140-173, and 151-169 but increased to 3.55–4.98 μA
cm–2 [log C]−1) for larger peptides (1-86 and 1-173) (Table S4).

PTHrP 1-173.

Multiplexed Peptide Detection
Peptide fragments with
the best sensitivities (1-86 and 1-173) were selected for multiplexed
detection (Figure S5A and Table S4). Minimal cross-reactivity was found between antibodies
for PTHrP 1-173 and 1-86 (Figure S5B).
Calibration plots for detection of PTHrP 1-173 and 1-86 standard mixtures
(Figure 3) show linear
dynamic ranges from 150 aM to 600 fM. LODs were 400 aM for 1-86, 300
aM for 1-173 using PA104 antibody, and 150 aM for 1-173 using PA6.
Good reproducibility is illustrated by small error bars (Figure 3B,D,F). Combination
of PA104 and IgY3104 and PA6 and IgY3103 gave similar sensitivity
for detection of intact PTHrP 1-173 isoform (4.49 vs 4.48 μA
cm–2 [log C]−1, Figure 3B,F), consistent
with separate specificity tests (Figure S5B) and binding studies.37

Validation of Accuracy
Serum samples from cancer patients
with solid tumors and cancer-free individuals were assayed and compared
with IRMA results. The antibody used for 1-86 peptide binds all three
PTHrP isoforms and their N-terminal fragments. The antibody used for
1-173 binds PTHrP 1-173 and shorter C-terminal fragments including
140-173 and 151-169.37 Significant differences
in PTHrP levels between cancer patients and cancer-free controls were
observed. Cancer patient samples had larger amounts of PTHrP up to
9 pM compared to healthy individuals (<1 pM, Figure 4A,B), with statistical difference between
means confirmed by t tests (P <
0.001) (Table S5). Assays by the immunoarray
(1-86) and IRMA gave similar levels of PTHrP and t tests (P < 0.001) confirmed no significant difference
between the two methods (Figure 4C). The immunoarray detected PTHrP in all samples including
4 samples with PTHrP levels that were too low to be measured by IRMA.
Immunoarray results for 1-86 also gave good linear correlation with
IRMA for 57 samples (22 controls and 35 cancer subjects) with slopes
close to 1 (0.90 ± 0.02), intercepts near 0 (1.33 ± 0.51)
and r2 = 0.99 (Figure 4D and Table S6). These results confirm the accuracy of our immunoarray protocol.
Values obtained with microfluidic assays measuring intact PTHrP 1-173
and its (C-terminal) fragments (red) were only slightly lower than
those from the 1-86 assay (blue) recognizing all three isoforms and
short N-terminal fragments, suggesting that PTHrP 1-173 and its short
C-terminal fragments are the major forms of PTHrP in serum (Figure 4C).

PTHrP (n = 12) and (D) correlation plot of IRMA and
immunoarray data (1-86 and 1-173) (n = 57). Asterisk
(*) denotes value below IRMA LOD.

Data were also analyzed using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) plots to predict diagnostic accuracy. Here, sensitivity (true
positive rate) is plotted against 100-specificity (false positive
rate) for different cutoff points. A test with perfect discrimination
has a ROC curve that passes through the upper left corner (100% sensitivity,
100% specificity).39 The area under a ROC
curve (AUC) quantifies the overall ability of the test to discriminate
between individuals with and without the disease. Data with zero false
positives and zero false negatives has an AUC of 1.00.

For PTHrP
(n = 57) the ROC plot had AUC 0.96 for
the 1-86 fragment assay and 0.94 for PTHrP 1-173. The 1-86 fragments
gave 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity while intact PTHrP 1-173
gave 82.9% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. The cancer vs noncancer
cutoff PTHrP was 1.1 pM using the 1-86 assay, in agreement with IRMA
results. Curves for individual peptides (Figure 5A) gave relatively similar sensitivity and
specificity when using normalized, mean values of the two peptides
(Figure 5B).

and (B) normalized value for both 1-86 and 1-173 with AUC 0.96, 100%
specificity and 80% sensitivity.

Discussion
Results described above demonstrate the
first assay for simultaneous
detection of PTHrP and its peptide fragments in serum with ultralow
LODs of 150 aM. Compared to commercial clinical assays such as IRMA
and ELISA kits (0.3–4 pM), our microfluidic immunoarray assay
represents more than 1000-fold better detection limits for PTHrP or
indeed any peptides (see introduction). In
addition, this method offers a degree of automation as well as simplicity
to bring assays to a point of care setting. Judged against competing
analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, the excellent sensitivity
(2–5 μA cm–2 [log C]−1), low cost, and reasonable speed reflect key
advantages of this electrochemical assay. The 1 μm superparamagnetic
beads with 250 000 ± 15 000 HRP labels and 120 000
± 8 000 antibodies (Ab2) per bead enabled high
capture efficiency and ultrahigh sensitivity in 30 min assays. To
reiterate, the 1-86 peptide assays measure the level of all three
PTHrP isoforms (PTHrP 1-139, 1-141, and 1-173) and their fragments
containing N-terminal ends. The assay using 1-173 as a standard measures
the complete isoform PTHrP 1-173 and its short C-terminal fragments.
The results in Figure 4D are consistent with this fact since the slope of the IRMA-microfluidic
assay correlation plot for the I-173 standard is less than that of
1-86, since IRMA measured I-86. A novel and interesting observation
from Figure 4C is that
circulating concentrations of the PTHrP 1-173 isoform and its C-terminal
fragments were only slightly smaller that the concentrations of all
three isoforms and their fragments measured by the I-86 assay, suggesting
that PTHrP 1-173 and its short C-terminal fragments are the predominant
circulating forms of PTHrP. This preliminary finding requires further
study in larger cohorts.

Sensitivities of single-detection assays
ranged from 2 to 5 μA
cm–2 [log C]−1. The highest sensitivities were obtained for peptide fragments 1-86
and 1-173. Assay results revealed a significant difference between
the levels of PTHrP in healthy individuals (<1 pM) (Figure S6) compared to cancer patients. Our assays
could also detect PTHrP levels in all the samples (Figure 4). In agreement, ROC analyses
(Figure 5) gave 80–83%
clinical sensitivity and 96–100% clinical specificity for detection
of cancer using the combined PTHrP 1-86 and 1-173 assay. While clearly
more samples need to be analyzed for confirmation, results suggest
a high potential of the PTHrP 1-86 and 1-173 immunoassay for early
stage cancer diagnostics.

Fragments of PTHrP are under investigation
to determine their diagnostic
potential in a variety of human cancers. Washam et al. identified
N-terminal fragment of PTHrP 12-48 as a plasma biomarker for breast
cancer bone metastasis with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of
93%.40 Using mass spectrometry, PTHrP 12-48
was significantly elevated in plasma of breast cancer patients with
bone metastasis compared to controls without metastasis (P < 0.0001). Combination of a clinical serum marker N-telopeptide
of type I collagen (NTx) with plasma PTHrP 12-48 greatly increased
the diagnostic specificity and accuracy (AUC = 0.99). The LOD of the
mass spectrometry method was in ng/mL (nanomolar) range. Our assay,
on the other hand, can detect PTHrP levels and both large and small
fragment sizes at levels as low as 150 aM and at much lower cost than
mass spectrometry, which cannot approach such low detection levels.25,26

The microfluidic immunoarray offers a simple, rapid, low cost
way
to simultaneously detect PTHrP peptide fragments. Inkjet printing
technology offers both a simple and elegant way to fabricate disposable
low-cost sensor electronics for the immunoarray. A single 8-electrode
array costs ∼$0.2 in materials and up to 56 arrays can be printed
in a single run.36 Thus, ease of fabrication
and utilization of commercial components makes this approach accessible
to virtually any biomedical laboratory at low cost. Capture and detection
chamber are made by templating PDMS channels on machined aluminum
molds to avoid lithography and mounted on hard plastic PMMA housings
with inlet and outlet lines. The microfluidic device requires only
a small sample volume (5 μL) and offers a degree of automation
and reliability to enhance reproducibility and throughput. These advantages
make the microfluidic immunoarrays a promising tool for development
of sensitive, integrated, portable, clinical diagnostic devices in
a short time with minimal sample and reagent requirements. Additional
design improvements are underway with a goal of achieving a pump-free,
automated microfluidic assay for point-of-care diagnostics.

In summary, we describe above a novel approach for simultaneous
detection of isoforms of PTHrP in an assay suitable for comparing
circulating forms. The assay provides the best detection limit for
peptide detection to date and enables accurate analysis of normal
and pathological clinical samples with numerous potential applications
in pathologies and physiological conditions in which PTHrP has been
implicated. Results from cancer patient sample analyses support the
potential diagnostic utility of such assays, although a much larger
sample cohort will be required for full clinical validation. The analytical
approach is general and should be applicable to measurement of any
peptides for which two appropriate antibodies exist.
