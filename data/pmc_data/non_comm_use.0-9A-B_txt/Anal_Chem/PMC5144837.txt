G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) are the largest protein family
for cell signal transduction, and most of them are crucial drug targets.
Conventional label-free assays lack the spatial information to address
the heterogeneous response from single cells after GPCRs activation.
Here, we reported a GPCRs study in live cells using plasmonic-based
electrochemical impedance microscopy. This label-free optical imaging
platform is able to resolve responses from individual cells with subcellular
resolution. Using this platform, we studied the histamine mediated
GPCRs activation and revealed spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cellular
downstream responses. Triphasic responses were observed from individual
HeLa cells upon histamine stimulation. A quick peak P1 in less than
10 s was attributed to the GPCRs triggered calcium release. An inverted
P2 phase within 1 min was attributed to the alternations of cell–matrix
adhesion after the activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC). The main
peak (P3) around 3–6 min after the histamine treatment was
due to dynamic mass redistribution and showed a dose-dependent response
with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 3.9
± 1.2 μM. Heterogeneous P3 responses among individual cells
were observed, particularly at high histamine concentration, indicating
diverse histamine H1 receptor expression level in the cell population.

==== Body
The G protein-coupled
receptors
(GPCRs) belong to a superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning proteins.
They mediate cellular events in response to a diverse array of extracellular
physical and chemical stimuli.1,2 GPCRs also control a
wide variety of metabolic functions and participate in progressions
of numerous diseases.3−5 Over a half of all marketed pharmaceuticals target
GPCRs, which bring in billions of profits in US dollars.6−9 Therefore, a better understanding of GPCRs signaling events together
with more sophisticated assays for identifying and characterizing
new molecules targeting GPCRs remain the major focuses for the pharmaceutical
industry.

Cell-based GPCRs screening with label-free technologies
has received
more attention in recent years. Most of these label-free assays detect
the optical or impedance response originating from cellular morphological
changes.10 A combination of these assays
with fluorescence imaging and molecular biology techniques has also
led to in-depth studies of GPCRs related physiological processes.
Despite the wide use of label-free technologies in cell-based GPCRs
screening, current approaches only measure the averaged response over
a large population of the cells and provide little information on
individual cell responses or subcellular activities. GPCRs often trigger
multiple downstream signaling pathways and lead to heterogeneous responses
among individual cells and/or subcellular areas. A spatiotemporally
resolved measurement is greatly needed for a comprehensive understanding
of the entire process.

Plasmonic-based electrochemical impedance
microscopy (P-EIM) is
a recently developed multifunctional label-free imaging platform that
has been used to study chemical and electrochemical reactions,11,12 molecular binding kinetics,13,14 and various cellular
processes.15,16 The detection principle of P-EIM
is based on the sensitive dependence of the surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) on the surface charge density of a gold sensing surface. The
modulated SPR signal was measured in response to the applied alternating
current, and the dc and ac components were converted to SPR and EIM
(electrochemical impedance microscopy) images, respectively.14,15 The SPR image is sensitive to mass change near the sensing surface
and therefore can measure the cellular mass distribution and dynamics,
and the EIM image provides information on cellular impedance or electrochemical
reactions. P-EIM is a powerful imaging tool for studying cellular
processes with submicrometer spatial resolution and millisecond temporal
resolution.15,16

Histamine H1 receptor is
an important drug target in the GPCRs
family. The binding between H1 receptor and its agonist histamine
sequentially activates the receptors, triggers calcium signaling,
activates the Protein Kinase C (PKC) process, and further leads to
increased vascular permeability through changing cell adhesion. This
change allows fluid and circulating cells from the blood to enter
into the surrounding tissues and causes symptoms such as swelling,
redness, and tenderness.17 In our previous
report, we specifically focused on the calcium signaling of a single
cell at the early stage of the GPCRs activation, which happened within
the first 5 s after histamine stimulation.16 Here, we studied the GPCRs signaling in a broader time range, from
tens of seconds to minutes, and observed heterogeneous triphasic responses
to histamine triggered GPCR activation in a population of HeLa cells
with subcellular resolution. Heterogeneous responses to GPCR activation
among individual cells were revealed, particularly at high histamine
concentration. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was determined from dose-dependent SPR responses, and the alternations
of cell–matrix adhesion were quantitatively studied with subcellular
resolution.

Materials and Methods
Materials
NaCl, KCl, MgCl2·6H2O, CaCl2, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), d-glucose,
1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic
acid (BAPTA-AM), cytochalasin D, triprolidine hydrochloride, and pyrilamine
maleate salt were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Histamine dihydrochloride
was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Deionized water was used to prepare
all the buffers.

Cell Culture
The human HeLa cells
were cultured in
a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 70%
relative humidity. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (DMEM, BioWhittaker) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Invitrogen) with 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged with 0.05% trypsin
and 0.02% ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma-Aldrich) when a confluence of
75% was reached.

P-EIM Microscopy
The P-EIM setup
was based on an objective-based
inverted microscope system introduced by Zare and colleagues.18 The optical system was comprised of a fiber-coupled
680 nm superluminescent diode light source (Qphotonics, LLC), an inverted
microscope (Olympus IX81), and a CCD camera (Pike F032B, Allied Vision).
The typical frame rate was from 20 to 380 fps, depending on the requirements
of the experiments. The sensor chips were BK7 glass coverslips coated
with ∼2 nm of chromium followed by ∼47 nm of gold. Before
use, each chip was washed with water and ethanol, followed by hydrogen
flame-annealing to remove surface contamination. A Flexi-Perm silicon
chamber (Sarstedt) was placed on top of the gold chip to serve as
cell culture well and experimental sample holder.

The electrical
potential of the sensor surface was controlled with respect to an
Ag/AgCl reference electrode with a bipotentiostat (Pine ARFDE5) and
a platinum-wire counter electrode. Modulation with typical frequency
(45 or 160 Hz), amplitude (±200 mV), and offset (−200
mV) was applied using an external function generator (DS345, Stanford
Research Systems).

HeLa cells were seeded on the gold sensor
chips. After overnight
incubation, the cells adhered to the gold surface and spread out.
HeLa monolayers were loaded with extracellular fluid (ECF) buffer
(NaCl: 120 mM; KCl: 3 mM; MgCl2: 2 mM; CaCl2: 2 mM; d-glucose: 25 mM; HEPES: 10 mM, pH 7.4) for the
P-EIM measurements. Histamine dihydrochloride was dissolved in the
ECF buffer with desired concentrations.

Results and Discussion
P-EIM
Measured HeLa Cells Responses to Histamine Induced GPCR
Activation
The typical bright field, SPR, and EIM images
of HeLa cells are shown in Figure 1a–c. Six μM of histamine was introduced
to HeLa cells to activate the endogenous histamine H1 receptor on
the cells. The averaged SPR signal of the HeLa cell population (black
line in Figure 1d)
reached a peak value at around 4 min after exposure to histamine and
then dropped slowly. The SPR responses from individual cells behaved
differently (shown as gray lines in Figure 1d). The EIM images showed a similar but reverse
trend of the responses (Figure 1e). The histograms of peak values of each cell at 4 min after
the injection of histamine (insets in Figure 1d,e) further illustrated the heterogeneous
responses among individual cells. The averaged SPR and EIM responses
were consistent with the results measured by the commercial optical
and electrochemical label-free systems.2,10,19 However, P-EIM provided individual cell information
not available from any of these commercial technologies.

HeLa cells on the Au sensor chip. White dotted lines outline the cells.
Scale bar: 20 μm. The size of a single pixel is ∼0.50
μm2. SPR (d) and EIM (e) recorded whole cell responses
to endogenous GPCR activation stimulated by 6 μM histamine injected
at t = 0 min. Gray profiles represent the responses
of individual cells, and black profiles are the averages of all the
cells. Insets: histograms of the SPR (or EIM) peak values of individual
cells after histamine treatment when the averaged SPR (or EIM) response
reached its peak at ∼4 min. (f) SPR profiles of GPCR stimulation
by different histamine concentrations (2 nM to 200 μM). Each
profile represents the averaged SPR response of the cells in the imaging
field. (g) Dose–response plot generated by plotting the averaged
peak SPR responses at 3–6 min after histamine treatment versus
corresponding histamine concentrations. EC50 value was
calculated from the dose response fitting curve (red curve). The error
bars represent the standard deviation among individual cell responses.

After we applied the first dose
of histamine and washed with buffer,
HeLa cells showed an attenuated SPR response to the second application
(Supporting Information S1), indicating
the desensitization of histamine GPCR receptors.20 Therefore, all data reported below were P-EIM responses
of HeLa cells to the first exposure of histamine, and fresh HeLa cell
coated chips were used for each measurement. To test whether the response
is dose dependent, we applied different concentrations (2 nM to 200
μM) of histamine to HeLa cells. Figure 1f shows the cellular responses with various
concentrations. Each curve represented the averaged SPR response of
all cells in the images. Dose-dependent responses were clearly observed.
We further calculate the peak values from each curve and plot them
against the logarithmic concentration of histamine (Figure 1g). Note that the error bars
are the standard deviations of SPR peak values of individual cells
in the field of view (e.g., Figure 1b,d), which represent the cell-to-cell variations in
the cell populations. The large standard deviations at higher histamine
concentrations indicate highly heterogeneous cellular responses to
histamine stimulation among the measured cells, which likely reflect
diverse histamine H1 receptor expression level in the cell population.
The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) is 3.9
± 1.2 μM after fitting, which is within the range of published
values.21,22 The histamine evoked SPR responses were
also well inhibited by two specific antagonists, tripolindine and
pyrilamine (Supporting Information S2),
which confirms that the P-EIM responses are specific to histamine
triggered GPCR activated cellular responses.

Triphasic and Heterogenic
P-EIM Responses
Besides the
main broad peak around 5 min after drug application, a close look
at the first 5 min of the response curves revealed two small peaks
(P1 and P2) in both SPR (Figure 2a) and EIM (Figure 2b) profiles, before the main peak (P3). This characteristic
triphasic response was observed from both the ensemble signal of multiple
cells and signals from individual cells. The initial quick peak (P1)
is typically evoked in less than 10 s. This peak corresponds to the
calcium release after GPCR activation as we reported previously.16

Figure 2 Triphasic and heterogenic P-EIM responses. SPR (a) and
EIM (b)
profiles of GPCR stimulation by 18 μM histamine in the first
350 s. Arrows indicate three phases (P1, P2, P3) of the profiles.
Gray profiles represent the responses of individual cells, and black
profiles are the averages of all the cells in the imaging field. The
size of a single pixel is ∼0.97 μm2.

Similar to P3, heterogeneous peak
amplitudes among individual cells
were also observed for both P1 and P2. In addition, a quantitative
analysis of the P1 and P2 peaks (Figure S3) revealed unsynchronized peak positions for each cell. As listed
in Table S1, SPR measured P1 ranged from
4 to 11 s and P2 ranged from 21 to 52 s, while EIM measured P1 ranged
from 2 to 5 s and P2 ranged from 13 to 30 s. These results show that
P-EIM is able to measure the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of
GPCR activated cellular responses among individual cells.

The
averaged time points of P1 and P2 peaks measured by EIM (2.9
and 22.4 s) were ahead of the peaks measured by SPR (6.4 and 35.4
s). While SPR measures mass changes in the bottom part of cells, EIM
detects the charge involved impedance changes from the entire cells.15,16 Therefore, the faster responses of EIM signal than SPR signal imply
that (1) the GPCR activated cellular process propagates from the top
(or inside) of the cells to the bottom of the cells, and/or (2) charge
involved cellular dynamics (such as calcium flow and kinase phosphorylation)
are ahead of noncharge involved dynamics, such as mass redistribution.

Contributions of the Central Area of the Cells Revealing the
P2 Peak by Subcelluar Analysis
To analyze subcellular details of GPCR activation, we selected three
cells (Figure 3a, bright
field) and showed the snapshots of the SPR images at 3, 18, and 240
s (Figure 3a), which
correspond to the P1, P2, and P3 phases (Figure 3b) of histamine activated GPCR responses.
After the quick positive peak P1, the SPR signal of the cell center
region then decreased, while other regions, especially the cell edge,
remained stable at t = 18 s, resulting in the negative
SPR peak (P2). After that, the center region recovered to the basal
level and the edge region kept increasing until it reached the main
peak (P3) after 200 s.

Figure 3 P-EIM visualization of subcellular responses to GPCR activation.
(a) The bright field image shows the HeLa cell locations, while differential
SPR images show the spatial-temporal patterns of subcellular responses
to GPCR activation, at t = 3, 18, and 240 s after
histamine treatment. Red dotted lines outline the cells in the bright
field and SPR images. (b) A typical whole cell SPR response profile
to 6 μM histamine triggered GPCR activation in HeLa cells. Arrows
P1 to P3 indicate times corresponding to SPR images shown in (a).
(c) SPR response profiles of four different subcellular regions within
a single cell that are marked by dotted lines with the corresponding
colors in the bright field image and by dashed lines with black colors
in SPR images in (a).

To quantify the subcellular response heterogeneity, we selected
four subcellular regions within a cell (Figure 3a, outlined by dashed lines) and plotted
the corresponding SPR profiles in Figure 3c. The region close to the cell edge has
a less negative P2 phase and a larger P3 plateau value, while other
regions located in the center of the cell have more negative P2 phases
and lower P3 plateau levels. The profiles also reveal that larger
negative P2 phases took a longer time to reach the P2 peak value.

Negative P2 Phase Measures Cell–Matrix Adhesion
It
has been well established that the binding of histamine to native
H1 receptors on the HeLa cell membrane23 mediates the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum
and consequently activates the Protein Kinase C (PKC) pathway. The
formation of the Ca2+–calmodulin complex increases
myosin light chain phosphorylation and initiates the contraction of
actin filaments.24 Ca2+ also
affects cadherin adhesion,25−27 causing altered cell adhesion
junctions. Eventually, histamine regulates vascular endothelial permeability
or airway epithelial permeability by altering the cell–cell
and cell–matrix adhesion, resulting in an inflammatory response.

We found both P2 and P3 phases were inhibited by either BAPTA-AM
or cytochalasin D pretreatment, which can chelate intercellular calcium
or disrupt the process of actin polymerization, respectively (Figure 4b, open gray circle
and triangle). It suggests that P2 and P3 phases correspond to the
alteration of cell adhesion and cellular morphological changes caused
by the PKC pathway triggered actin or cadherin activities. The main
peak P3 has been reported to be caused by cellular morphological changes
and dynamic mass redistribution.2,10,19

Figure 4 P-EIM
images revealed similarity between the P2 phase cellular
responses to histamine activation and cellular responses to hypertonic
stress. (a) The bright field image shows individual HeLa cells where
red dotted lines outline the cells. Differential SPR images show cellular
responses to 6 μM histamine stimulation and +5% osmotic pressure
change, when the SPR response reaches its lowest value (55 s after
histamine injection and 19 s after osmotic pressure change). White
dotted lines outline the cells in the SPR images. (b) The SPR responses
to histamine stimulation (region 1: black solid line; region 2: black
dashed line) and +5% osmotic pressure change (region 1: red dash-dotted
line; region 2: red dotted line) at the two black dotted lines marked
subcellular regions in the images. The averaged SPR responses of histamine
stimulation after 10 μM BAPTA-AM pretreatment for 20 min (open
gray circle, ○) and 100 nM cytochalasin D pretreatment for
30 min (open gray triangle, Δ) of multiple cells are shown as
controls. (c) Correlation map of lowest SPR values after histamine
stimulation (P2 phase) versus +5% osmotic pressure change as shown
in (b) from 20 different cells.

We further compared the SPR images of the negative P2 phase
after
histamine activation with the cellular response to the hypertonic
stress. These two distinct cellular events showed almost the same
subcellular SPR response patterns (Figure 4a) and intensities (Figure 4b). The multiple-cell analysis (N = 20) also showed that the negative SPR responses of histamine activation
were proportional to the hypertonic treatment (Figure 4c). It is known that hypertonic buffers increase
extracellular osmotic pressure and cause the cell to shrink and to
detach from the substrate,28 which in turn
decreases the local SPR intensity. Therefore, it suggests that the
observed negative P2 phase of SPR also corresponds to the cell–matrix
adhesion alteration caused by histamine activation. Both cellular
events affect the same subcellular regions where cell–matrix
interactions are weak and easily disturbed.

The cell–matrix
adhesion alternation induced by histamine
has been previously studied by fluorescence, transmission electron
microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy.25−27,29 However, the microscopy-based
methods lack the needed temporal resolution and quantitative information
to measure real time cellular dynamics, and the spectroscopy method
lacks the needed spatial resolution to resolve individual cell and
subcellular responses. P-EIM provides both subcellular spatial resolution
and fast temporal response, which allows real time quantitative mapping
of the cell–matrix displacement within a single cell. By simulating
the SPR response to the cellular structure using the Winspall program
(http://www.res-tec.de/downloads.html), the average cell–matrix distance is estimated to be 103
nm, with a sensitivity of 0.048 nm/mDeg for cell–matrix displacement
(Supporting Information S4). Therefore,
on the basis of the local SPR intensity change, we calculated the
cell–matrix displacement with values typically around a few
to ten nanometers (Figure 4a, indicated as the displacement color map).

A pixel-wised
quantitative analysis of the cell images in Figure 3 enabled one to visualize
the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of histamine induced cell–matrix
interaction alternations at the P2 peak. The original SPR image sequences
were processed by 4 × 4 binning to reduce shot noises, and then,
the peak values for each pixel in the image sequences were converted
to the cell–matrix displacement distances; the corresponding
peak positions were identified as the response time. The results are
shown as maps of maximum cell–matrix distance displacements
(Figure 5a) and the
response time (Figure 5b). The positions of the cold pixels (blue color) in Figure 5a matched well with the hot
pixels (bright yellow color) in Figure 5b, indicating the response time is scaled with cell–matrix
distance displacements.

interaction alternations. Mapping of (a) the maximum cell–matrix
distance displacements and (b) the corresponding response time at
the lowest points of the negative P2 phase after histamine activation.

were set to zero.

Conclusion
P-EIM
was used to monitor real time cellular dynamics of histamine
evoked GPCRs activation in HeLa cells. Triphasic responses from individual
cells were observed in both SPR and EIM images. The initial quick
peak (P1) in less than 10 s was attributed to the GPCR triggered calcium
release. The inverted P2 phase within 1 min is believed to be due
to the alternations of cell–matrix adhesion activated by the
PKC pathway, because the subcellular analysis shows that the P2 phase
is similar to the cellular response to the hypertonic stress. The
dynamic mass redistribution contributed to the main peak (P3) around
3–6 min after the histamine treatment, and it showed a dose-dependent
response with EC50 = 3.9 ± 1.2 μM, consistent
with reported values. Highly scattered P3 responses among individual cells indicated diverse
histamine H1 receptor expression levels in the cell population. We
further quantified the cell–matrix vertical displacements with
nanometer precision and visualized the cell–matrix interaction
dynamics using single-pixel-based analysis. Our findings show that
P-EIM is a useful tool to study the GPCR activation process and for
understanding the subcellular basis of histamine triggered cellular
permeability regulation, which will help the development of novel
inflammation therapeutics and antihistamine drugs.
