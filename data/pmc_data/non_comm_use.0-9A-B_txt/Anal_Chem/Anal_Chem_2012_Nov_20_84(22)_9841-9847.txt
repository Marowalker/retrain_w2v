Membrane proteins are notoriously challenging to analyze
using
mass spectrometry (MS) because of their insolubility in aqueous solution.
Current MS methods for studying intact membrane proteins involve solubilization
in detergent. However, detergents can destabilize proteins, leading
to protein unfolding and aggregation, or resulting in inactive entities.
Amphipathic polymers, termed amphipols, can be used as a substitute
for detergents and have been shown to enhance the stability of membrane
proteins. Here, we show the utility of amphipols for investigating
the structural and functional properties of membrane proteins using
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The functional
properties of two bacterial outer-membrane β-barrel proteins,
OmpT and PagP, in complex with the amphipol A8-35 are demonstrated,
and their structural integrities are confirmed in the gas phase using
ESI-MS coupled with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The data illustrate
the power of ESI-IMS-MS in separating distinct populations of amphipathic
polymers from the amphipol–membrane complex while maintaining
a conformationally “nativelike” membrane protein structure
in the gas phase. Together, the data indicate the potential importance
and utility of amphipols for the analysis of membrane proteins using
MS.

==== Body
Integral membrane proteins play
essential roles in many biological processes, such as transport of
solutes, signaling, and energy transduction. Despite this, our fundamental
knowledge of the structure of membrane proteins and how they fold,
assemble, and function remains limited. Membrane proteins are notoriously
difficult to study; their expression and purification is challenging,
and problems occur when trying to preserve the structural activity
and the stability of these proteins in vitro.1

Currently the most common method to study membrane proteins
in
aqueous solution involves the initial solubilization of the protein
in micelle-forming detergent molecules. However, detergent micelles
are not optimal for preserving membrane protein function due to their
highly dynamic nature, and thus, protein unfolding and aggregation
in detergent micelles are commonly observed.2,3 In
addition, the spherical micelles do not always provide a nativelike
environment for the proteins, poorly mimicking the physical and chemical
properties of the planar cellular membrane depending on the match
of the detergent and the lipid. Therefore, alternative membrane solubilization
techniques are needed.1,4

One alternative to exploiting
detergent micelles for membrane protein
solubilization are amphipathic polymers termed amphipols that were
designed to bind noncovalently to the transmembrane region of membrane
proteins in a quasi-irreversible manner.4,5 The major benefit
of amphipols is that they can allow membrane proteins to fold into
their native state in detergent-free solution. Additionally, membrane
proteins complexed with amphipols have an increased stability compared
with those in detergent.4,5 Over the past few years,
amphipols have been used to study membrane protein complexes using
a variety of biochemical techniques including size-exclusion chromatography,6 electron microscopy,7 analytical ultracentrifugation,6 fluorescence
resonance energy transfer,8 and solution
NMR.9−11 A recent publication described the use of matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) to determine the
molecular mass of the amphipol-trapped membrane proteins bacteriorhodopsin,
OmpA, cytochrome b6f, and cytochrome bc1.12 However, the conformational
properties of the membrane proteins in the gas phase cannot be determined
using this approach, and their functional behavior cannot be studied.

Here, we demonstrate the application of electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and ESI-MS coupled with ion mobility spectrometry
(IMS), to the study of native membrane proteins in complex with amphipols.
Two bacterial β-barrel outer-membrane proteins (PagP and OmpT),
whose interactions with amphipols have not previously been studied,
were folded into the amphipol, A8-35 (Figure 1A). In both cases, the proteins were highly stable, remaining functionally
active for several months in complex with the amphipol at 4 °C
in ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 8. ESI-IMS-MS enabled separation
of the amphipol from the membrane proteins in the gas phase, thus
allowing the conformational properties of both OmpT and PagP within
the membrane protein–amphipol complex to be determined. The
results highlight the power of amphipols to solubilize and maintain
membrane proteins in their native state and present the first example
of the analysis of the structure of membrane proteins by ESI-IMS-MS
as a result of the ability of amphipols to protect and preserve membrane
protein structure on transition into the gas phase.

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
PagPhis was expressed
and purified as described previously.13 The gene encoding the mature OmpT sequence was amplified from Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells using polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), ligated into the pET-11a plasmid vector using BamHI and NdeI restriction sites, and transformed
into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells to enable
protein overexpression. Overexpression and subsequent isolation of
inclusion bodies of OmpT were carried out as described by Burgess
et al.14 To purify the protein further,
OmpT inclusion bodies were gel-filtered in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride
using a Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
Bucks, U.K.). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride,
25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation at 20 000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was
filtered through a 0.2 μM syringe filter before loading onto
the column. Following gel filtration, OmpT was precipitated by dialysis
against deionized H2O, and the protein was stored as a
precipitate at −80 °C. To fold the membrane proteins into
amphipol, PagP and OmpT were dissolved initially in 100 mM ammonium
hydrogen carbonate pH 8.0 containing 8 M urea. A8-35 (purchased from
Affymetrix Ltd., High Wycombe, Bucks, U.K.) was then added at a protein/A8-35
ratio of 1:5 (w/w), and the resulting solution was dialyzed into 100
mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate pH 8.0 at 4 °C for 24 h. A final
membrane protein concentration of 1 mg mL–1 was
used for all experiments.

Circular Dichroism
Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra
of all proteins were recorded on a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied
Photophysics, Leatherhead, Surrey, U.K.) using a 0.1 mm path length
cuvette. Eight scans were acquired over the range 200–260 nm
with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm and a scan speed of 20 nm min–1 and then averaged. Background spectra containing the amphipol and
buffer alone were subtracted for all samples. The recorded CD spectra
were normalized to obtain the mean residue molar ellipticity [Θ]
(λ), in deg cm2 dmol–1:  where l is the path length
of the cuvette (cm), Θ(λ) is the recorded ellipticity
(deg), c is the concentration (moles L–1), and n is the number of amino acid residues: 297
for OmpT and 169 for PagP.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
Size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) was carried out using a Superdex 200 (10/300) column connected
to an Äkta Explorer system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
Bucks, U.K.). A 200 μL aliquot of protein/A8-35 complex was
injected onto the column pre-equilibrated in either 100 mM ammonium
hydrogen carbonate pH 8.0 (folded) or 100 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate
pH 8.0 containing 8 M urea (unfolded). Elution profiles were followed
using the absorbance at 280 nm for all proteins.

Activity Assays
To measure OmpT protease activity,
the change in fluorescence emission at 430 nm of the cleavable fluorogenic
peptide (Abz-Ala-Arg-Arg-Ala-Tyr-(NO2)-NH2)
(Cambridge Peptides Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.) was measured upon excitation
at 325 nm.15 The excitation and emission
slit widths were set to 2 nm, and the fluorescence was measured over
a 300 s reaction time scale using a fluorimeter (Photon Technology
International Inc., Ford, West Sussex, U.K.). The temperature was
regulated to 25 °C using a water bath, and a 1 cm path length
cuvette was used. In some experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli O111:B4 (cat. no. 437627, Calbiochem, Beeston,
Notts, U.K.), the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer
membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, was added to the OmpT–A8-35
solution at a concentration of 1 mg mL–1. In all
cases, the fluorogenic peptide was added immediately before analysis
to a final concentration of 50 μM. Samples were mixed manually,
resulting in a dead time of approximately 15 s. The average specific
enzyme activity over a range of protein concentrations was reported
as the amount of product produced per milligram of enzyme per minute;
that is, the relative fluorescence units measured were expressed as
a percentage of the total relative fluorescence value taken at the
end of the reaction. A control in which OmpT was unfolded in 8 M urea
confirmed that the observed activity resulted from the natively folded
OmpT–A8-35 complex.

The enzymatic activity assay for
PagP was adapted from a previously described method.13 The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate
(p-NPP) to p-nitrophenol (p-NP) by PagP was monitored by the increase in absorbance
at 410 nm. p-NPP (10 mM in propan-2-ol) was diluted
into 100 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate pH 8.0 containing various
concentrations of PagP/A8-35 complex to a final substrate concentration
of 1 mM, and the rate of reaction was monitored over 200 min. The
increase in absorbance due to A8-35 addition alone was subtracted
from all measurements. A control in which PagP was unfolded in 8 M
urea confirmed the activity resulted from the natively folded PagP/A8-35
complex. The average specific enzyme turnover over a range of protein
concentrations was reported in nanomoles per minute per micromolar
of PagP using an extinction coefficient of 3390 M–1 cm–1 for p-nitrophenol.

Mass Spectrometry
Experimental measurements were performed
on a Synapt HDMS mass spectrometer (Micromass UK Ltd./Waters, Manchester,
U.K.) equipped with a NanoMate (Advion Biosystems Inc., Ithaca, NY,
U.S.) nanoESI autosampling device. Positive nanoESI with a capillary
voltage of 1.75 kV, a nitrogen nebulizing gas pressure of 0.5 p.s.i,
and a source temperature of 60 °C was used throughout. For mass
spectral analysis of the amphipol alone, a cone voltage of 70 V, a
trap voltage of 6 V, and a transfer voltage of 4 V was applied. For
analysis of PagP and OmpT in the amphipol, a cone voltage of 170 V
was applied with the trap, and transfer T-wave devices were set at
150 and 100 V respectively; a backing pressure of 4.7 mbar and a trap
pressure of 3.85 × 10–2 mbar were used. The
bias voltage was optimized (20–150 V) in order to maximize
the intensity of the membrane protein. Ion mobility separation was
performed by ramping the wave height from 4.5 to 28.5 V at a speed
of 300 ms–1. Drift times were corrected for mass-dependent
and mass-independent times,16 and the drift
time cross-section function was calibrated as reported previously.17 Computer-based cross-sectional area calculations
were made from Protein Data Bank structures of the two membrane proteins
(Figure 1B, C) using the projection superposition
approximation (PSA) method described elsewhere.18 An aqueous solution of CsI was used for m/z calibration. All data were acquired over the m/z range 500–8000, and the raw
data were processed by use of MassLynx v.4.1 and Driftscope v.3.0
software (Micromass UK Ltd./Waters, Manchester, U.K.).

Results and Discussion
The compatibility of amphipol–membrane
protein complexes
for analysis using ESI-IMS-MS was investigated through the study of
two bacterial outer-membrane β-barrel proteins OmpT and PagP.
The interaction between the β-barrel outer-membrane proteins
OmpT and PagP with amphipols has not been reported previously.

Folding OmpT into A8-35
OmpT is a 10-stranded, 33.5
kDa outer-membrane β-barrel protein (Figure 1B). OmpT folds and inserts into the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria facilitated by the Bam complex.19 It is only here, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), that
OmpT is functional as an outer-membrane protease.20 To initiate folding, OmpT unfolded in 8 M urea pH 8.0,
was mixed with a 5-fold excess (w/w) of the amphipol A8-35, and the
resulting sample was dialyzed immediately into 100 mM ammonium hydrogen
carbonate pH 8.0. OmpT remained soluble in this urea-free buffer at
a concentration up to 1 mg mL–1, and no evidence
of aggregation or precipitation was apparent by use of sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) or mass spectrometry, suggesting that if higher order
species exist, they are neither SDS-resistant nor observed in the
gas phase. The stoichiometry of OmpT binding to A8-35 is unknown.

Cold sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
can be used to distinguish between folded and fully denatured forms
of membrane proteins.21 Indeed, when A8-35-solubilized
OmpT was analyzed using cold SDS-PAGE, the protein migrated as a single
band more rapidly than expected based on its molecular weight, indicating
that complete refolding of OmpT had occurred into A8-35 (Figure 2A). SEC showed a single peak corresponding to the
OmpT–A8-35 complex indicating that a single species is present
in solution (Figure 2B). Consistent with these
results, far-UV CD showed a characteristic negative maximum at 218
nm, indicating a high content of β-sheet secondary structure
had formed in the OmpT–A8-35 complex (Figure 2C).

0.30 μM (red) OmpT–A8-35 complex in the presence of LPS.
The inset shows the weak catalytic activity of OmpT–A8-35 without
LPS at OmpT–A8-35 concentrations of 0.05 μM (black),
0.15 μM (green), and 0.30 μM (red).

The functionality of the refolded OmpT–A8-35
complex was
examined by use of a fluorescence assay. On addition of LPS, native
OmpT readily cleaves an internally quenched fluorogenic peptide (Abz-Ala-Arg-Arg-Ala-Tyr-(NO2)-NH2) resulting in an increase in fluorescence
at 430 nm.15 However, in vitro experiments
with OmpT in complex with detergent and liposomes have shown that
no increase in fluorescence is observed in the absence of LPS.15,22 The OmpT–A8-35 complex was incubated at various concentrations
with and without LPS, and the OmpT enzyme activity was measured based
on the observed increase in fluorescence of the same fluorescent peptide
substrate (Figure 2D). The specific activity
of OmpT was found to be 0.7 μmoles of product per milligram
of enzyme per minute confirming that OmpT had folded to a functional
state in the amphipol. Interestingly, a small amount of activity was
observed in the absence of LPS (0.1 μmoles product per milligram
of enzyme per minute) (Figure 2D inset). However,
this is a 6-fold reduction compared with the activity observed in
the presence of LPS (Figure 2D) and hence is
consistent with previous results that have shown a requirement of
LPS for OmpT activity.23 Together the cold
SDS-PAGE, far-UV CD, SEC, and fluorescence activity data show that
OmpT folds readily into the A8-35 amphipol to form a native, functional
OmpT–A8-35 complex. Interestingly, this OmpT–A8-35 complex
is remarkably stable as OmpT remains folded in its β-sheet conformation,
with a less than 3-fold decrease in activity over two months of storage
at 4 °C.

Folding PagP into A8-35
The role of the smaller, 20.2
kDa membrane protein PagP (Figure 1C) is to
transfer a palmitate chain from phospholipids to the lipid A moiety
of LPS in the outer leaflet of the bacterial outer membrane, reinforcing
the hydrocarbon core of the outer leaflet and protecting it from host
immune defenses.24 PagP was folded into
A8-35 using the same procedure as described for OmpT. Cold SDS-PAGE
showed that ∼60% of PagP was folded into A8-35 (Figure 3A). In support of this conclusion, SEC showed a
broad peak for the PagP–A8-35 complex compared with the elution
profile of PagP in the urea-denatured state, also indicating a mixture
of folded and unfolded PagP species to be present in solution (Figure 3A, B). Despite both the PagP/A8-35 ratio and the
folding rate into the amphipol being optimized to obtain the maximum
folding yield of PagP into amphipol, this was the highest yield achieved.
Far-UV CD data confirmed that the PagP in complex with A8-35 has adopted
a β-sheet secondary structure, with a characteristic negative
maximum at 218 nm (Figure 3C). However, the
positive molar ellipticity at 232 nm commonly observed in the far-UV
CD spectrum of native PagP is absent.25 The band at 232 nm arises from a Cotton effect for the interaction
between residues Tyr26 and Trp66, which pack closely together in the
native PagP structure.25,26 The absence of this Cotton band
likely reflects slight structural perturbations in the PagP structure
in the presence of the amphipol. This has been reported previously
when local structural modifications were introduced through mutation
of residues in the active site of PagP.27 However, activity assays in which the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) to p-nitrophenol (p-NP) was monitored indicated that
PagP is indeed functional in the amphipol complex (Figure 3D). The specific enzyme activity of PagP in complex
with A8-35 was determined to be 0.019 ± 0.006 nmol min–1 μM–1, which is not significantly different
from previous results using PagP in detergent.13

The average specific enzyme turnover over the three protein concentrations
was reported in nmol min–1 μM–1 of PagP using an extinction coefficient of 3390 M–1 cm–1 for p-nitrophenol.

ESI-IMS-MS Analysis of A8-35–Membrane Protein Complexes
As a consequence of their heterogeneous nature, in terms of the
polydispersity within their structures, the study of amphipols by
mass spectrometry is challenging. Over recent years, ESI-IMS-MS has
been utilized increasingly to separate polymeric mixtures allowing
individual components within complex spectra to be assigned unambiguously.28 The three-dimensional ESI-IMS-MS spectrum of
the amphipol A8-35 is shown in Figure 4. Using
“soft” ionization conditions, multiple species are observed
from which 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ charge state ions can be separated clearly
and identified. Under soft ionization conditions, all membrane protein–amphipol
complexes were undetectable by ESI-MS (data not shown), presumably
because the membrane proteins remained in complex with the amphipol.
However, when the settings for the trap and transfer regions of the
mass spectrometer were increased to 150 and 100 V, respectively, the
membrane proteins were released from the amphipol, and ions corresponding
to the multiply charged membrane proteins were clearly detected (Figure 5A, B). By using ESI-IMS-MS, these ions were well
separated from those arising from the amphipol. The ESI-MS spectrum
of OmpT shows a narrow charge state distribution corresponding to
the 6+, 7+, and 8+ ions, together with slightly more expanded 9+ ions,
giving an experimentally determined mass of 33 462 ± 5
Da, which is within 0.01% of the calculated mass based on the amino
acid sequence (33 460 Da).

Figure 4 ESI-IMS-MS driftscope plot of the amphipol
A8-35 alone (5 mg mL–1 in 100 mM ammonium hydrogen
carbonate, pH 8) highlighting
the four different charge state ion series arising from the wide range
of A8-35 polymers. The graph shows the m/z of the ions vs the drift time (ms) of the ions in the
IMS cell. An ion’s drift time depends on both the shape (CCS)
of the ion and the number of charges it carries.

Figure 5 ESI-IMS-MS driftscope plots of (A) the OmpT–A8-35
complex
and (B) the PagP–A8-35 complex. The charge states of the ions
are labeled in all cases, and the summed m/z spectrum for each complex is displayed on the right-hand
side. White arrows in (A) and (B) highlight the compact protein conformer
in each case, while a second, more expanded conformer is observed
for the 7+ ions in the PagP–A8-35 driftscope plot (red arrow).

ESI-IMS-MS was able not only to effect the release
of the PagP
membrane protein from the amphipol A8-35 but also to separate the
folded and unfolded PagP conformers that SDS-PAGE had indicated to
be present. The ESI-MS spectrum of PagP released from its complex
with A8-35 shows a narrow charge distribution (5+, 6+, and 7+ charge
state ions) corresponding to a compact structure of the expected molecular
mass (20 175 ± 1 Da compared with 20 175 Da predicted
based on the amino acid sequence), Figure 5B. However, significantly more expanded 7+ charge state ions indicative
of a second conformer could also be detected in the ESI-IMS-MS driftscope
plot (Figure 5B, red arrow). Higher charge
states (8+, 9+, and 10+) were also observed for this more expanded
PagP conformation (data not shown).

By using ESI-IMS-MS, ions
are separated according to their movement
through a mobility cell containing a buffer gas. By calibrating the
arrival time distributions of protein ions of known structure, the
collision cross-sectional areas (CCS) of unknown proteins can be estimated.17,29 These experimental CCS values can then be compared with modeled
values calculated by use of the PDB structures of the proteins of
interest. If the experimentally estimated and theoretically determined
CCS values are in agreement, it can be inferred that the protein retains
a nativelike structure in the gas phase.29 The experimentally estimated CCS for the lowest charge state ions
of PagP and OmpT (1790 and 2601 Å2, respectively)
are consistent within experimental error with the values predicted
from their PDB crystal structure coordinates using the projected superposition
approximation method (PSA)18 (1732 and
2718 Å2, respectively). These data suggest that both
PagP and OmpT remain in a nativelike conformation in the gas phase
and thus demonstrate the power of amphipols in preserving membrane
protein structure on transition from solution into the gas phase.
An additional conformer some 70% more expanded was also observed for
the membrane protein PagP (3131 Å2). This observation
is consistent with the SDS-PAGE and SEC data that indicate that PagP
is not 100% folded in A8-35 and confirms the ability of ESI-IMS-MS
to transfer and separate folded and partially folded solution structures
into the gas phase.

Conclusions
The analysis of membrane proteins by ESI-MS
has been demonstrated
recently following solubilization of membrane proteins in detergent
micelles.30 This approach, while very powerful,
has limitations because of the instability of the membrane protein–detergent
complexes and the difficulties in preserving protein structure, protein–protein,
and protein–ligand interactions in detergent solutions.1 Amphipols offer the ability to trap membrane
proteins in detergent-free aqueous solutions, offering new possibilities
for the structural analysis of membrane proteins by ESI-MS. Additionally,
amphipols are particularly stable in aqueous solution containing low
salt concentrations that are ideal conditions for mass spectral analysis.

In the present work, we have used ESI-IMS-MS to examine two different
membrane proteins refolded into the amphipol A8-35. Biophysical analysis
confirmed that each of the A8-35–membrane protein complexes
was stable and the protein folded into a native conformation that
is functionally active in the MS-compatible buffers used. ESI-IMS-MS
was used to release and separate the membrane proteins from the amphipol
in the gas phase, thus allowing characterization of the membrane proteins
alone. CCS calculations confirmed that A8-35 preserves these membrane
proteins in a nativelike structure on transition into the gas phase,
resulting in experimental CCSs within 5% of those obtained from theoretical
values calculated based on the PDB structures of these proteins. Additionally,
we show that ESI-IMS-MS can separate proteins populating different
conformations in complex with A8-35, reflecting their solution properties.
The application of A8-35 to two different β-barrel membrane
proteins suggests that this procedure could be widely applicable to
this major class of membrane proteins, as well as to other, more complex,
membrane proteins. Indeed, the higher the m/z ratio of the membrane protein complex, the easier its
separation from the lower m/z ions
arising from the amphipol during ESI-IMS-MS analysis.

Nanodiscs
provide an alternate strategy of solubilizing membrane
proteins for study by MS.31 Typically,
nanodiscs consist of a lipid bilayer surrounded by a stabilizing scaffold
protein into which a membrane protein can be inserted.4,32,33 Although membrane proteins inside
nanodiscs reside in a nativelike environment, the preparation of nanodiscs
containing membrane proteins is not straightforward. Several parameters
need to be optimized, including the type of lipid and the lipid–protein
ratio, which vary for each protein sample. These complex systems have
eluded analysis by ESI-MS to date. Insertion of outer membrane proteins
into amphipols, by contrast, is relatively straightforward with only
the protein/amphipol ratio needing optimization.

As amphipols
become more commercially available, the study of membrane
proteins in amphipols should become increasingly utilized within the
membrane protein field. The additional stability that amphipols offer
makes these membrane protein–amphipol complexes highly favorable
over traditional methods that use detergent to solubilize the membrane
proteins of interest. Since membrane proteins constitute approximately
30% of the proteome and more than 50% of all known drug targets, the
study of membrane proteins by high-throughput mass spectrometric techniques
will become increasingly important for this challenging field of research.
