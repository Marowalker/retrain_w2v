Gas-phase electrophoretic mobility
molecular analysis (GEMMA) separates
nanometer-sized, single-charged particles according to their electrophoretic
mobility (EM) diameter after transition to the gas-phase via a nano
electrospray process. Electrospraying as a soft desorption/ionization
technique preserves noncovalent biospecific interactions. GEMMA is
therefore well suited for the analysis of intact viruses and subviral
particles targeting questions related to particle size, bioaffinity,
and purity of preparations. By correlating the EM diameter to the
molecular mass (Mr) of standards, the Mr of analytes can be determined. Here, we demonstrate
(i) the use of GEMMA in purity assessment of a preparation of a common
cold virus (human rhinovirus serotype 2, HRV-A2) and (ii) the analysis
of subviral HRV-A2 particles derived from such a preparation. (iii)
Likewise, native mass spectrometry was employed to obtain spectra
of intact HRV-A2 virions and empty viral capsids (B-particles). Charge
state resolution for the latter allowed its Mr determination. (iv) Cumulatively, the data measured and published
earlier were used to establish a correlation between the Mr and EM diameter for a range of globular proteins and
the intact virions. Although a good correlation resulted from this
analysis, we noticed a discrepancy especially for the empty and subviral
particles. This demonstrates the influence of genome encapsulation
(preventing analytes from shrinking upon transition into the gas-phase)
on the measured analyte EM diameter. To conclude, GEMMA is useful
for the determination of the Mr of intact
viruses but needs to be employed with caution when subviral particles
or even empty viral capsids are targeted. The latter could be analyzed
by native MS.

Gas-phase
electrophoretic mobility
molecular analysis (GEMMA) is applicable for the analysis of material
in the single-digit nanometer size range up to particles of several
hundred nanometers in diameter.1−3 Lately, also other acronyms for
the same type of instrument, such as macro Ion Mobility Spectrometer
(macroIMS),4,5 LiquiScan-ES (official instrument name for
a short time given by the manufacturing company, TSI Inc.), ES-DMA,6 or ES-SMPS spectrometer7 appear in the literature. However, to remain consistent with work
from our and other laboratories, the term “GEMMA” will
be used throughout the manuscript.

GEMMA measurements are based
on the separation of single-charged
particles obtained from a nano electrospray (ES) source followed by
charge reduction in a bipolar atmosphere using a 210Po
α-particle source. Particle separation is achieved by application
of a laminar flow and an orthogonal electric field in a differential
mobility analyzer (DMA)1,2 that sorts analytes according
to their respective electrophoretic mobility (EM) diameters. Particles
of a given size (i.e., the EM diameter) pass through the mobility
analyzer according to the applied electric field, E,
in the DMA unit. Variation of E, at constant laminar
flow, allows scanning of a given size range. Depending on the geometry
of the DMA, particles within different size ranges can be measured.8,9 These particles then act as condensation nuclei in a supersaturated
atmosphere of either n-butanol or water in a condensation
particle counter (CPC)10 and are counted
via passing through a focused laser beam. Analyte detection in the
CPC is therefore exclusively based on the number of particles practically
irrespective of their molecular mass (Mr) or chemical nature. Recent developments of GEMMA instruments (DMAs
with laminar flow values of 50 L per minute (Lpm)11 and even higher12) allow collection
of spectra with excellent resolution (see Figure S1 for comparison of GEMMA spectra obtained with various GEMMA
device generations using comparable samples).

Given that Mr standards of the same
chemical nature as the analyte are available, the Mr of an analyte can be determined from its EM diameter.1 This approach was first demonstrated with good
statistics by Bacher and colleagues3 for
proteins up to approximately 2 MDa. However, extrapolation of this
standard curve to human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV-A2) particles yielded
a Mr deviating by as much as 36% from
the value calculated from the sum of its building blocks (8085 kDa).
This deviation was attributed to the lack of standards with higher Mr (considering that protein standards mostly
well below 0.5 MDa were employed by Bacher et al.). Nevertheless,
it could be demonstrated that GEMMA allows for measurements of Mr’s by far exceeding the range currently
accessible to standard mass spectrometry. Kaddis and colleagues13 extended the original correlation curve to approximately
12 MDa by including cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and several
forms of protein vaults, i.e., large ribonucleoprotein particles of
ellipsoid shape found in eukaryotes. However, the Mr values of these particles were again calculated and
not experimentally assessed, and as for HRV-A2, the EM diameter/Mr data point for CCMV deviated significantly
from the fitted correlation curve. By the same token, the data points
for vaults scattered substantially possibly because of the nonspherical
nature of these latter analytes (see, e.g. ref (14)). Despite these apparent
challenges, GEMMA analyses are receiving increased attention in the
field of virology as can be learned from the rapidly growing number
of publications15−23 including ours on HRV.3,11,24−27

HRV-A2 (a HRV genus A serotype 2) is a nonenveloped icosahedral
virus of approximately 30 nm diameter as based on X-ray crystallography,28 cryo-electron microscopy 3D image reconstruction
(cryo-EM 3DR),29 and previous GEMMA3 measurements. It is composed of four viral proteins
(VP1–4), 60 copies each, and a single stranded, positive sense
RNA genome of approximately 7.1 kb length, covalently linked to a
single copy of the peptide VPg.30,31 During virus uncoating
(i.e., the process of viral RNA transfer from the capsid into the
cytosol of an infected cell), the protein shell undergoes conformational
changes resulting in subviral particles; the intermediate A-particle
has lost VP4 but still contains the RNA genome. On release of the
RNA (together with VPg), the empty capsid, the B-particle, remains.32 X-ray and cryo-EM 3DR reported an expansion
of the subviral A and B particles by approximately 4% with respect
to the native virus.33,34

Previous GEMMA analyses
revealed an additional component in virus
preparations (the “contaminant” first detected by capillary
electrophoresis, CE35) of an EM diameter
comparable to that of virions but of significantly higher heterogeneity.27 We tentatively identified it as cellular membrane
fragments. It is of note that only advancements in GEMMA instrumentation
of the past decade allowed for the differentiation of intact HRV-A2
and the contaminant because previous setups only yielded one broad
peak at the EM diameter of intact virus including both species (see Figure S1 for comparison of GEMMA spectra generated
by various GEMMA device generations and comparable HRV-A2 samples).

Bacher et al.3 demonstrated the conformational
changes during virus uncoating via a GEMMA prototype instrument is
possible and confirmed an approximately 4% increase in EM diameter
on formation of empty capsids (B-particles). Here, we report now a
repeat of these measurements with a more advanced GEMMA instrument.11 A highly pure virus stock, a prerequisite for
MS, electron microscopy, and GEMMA analyses,36 was used to eliminate any possible impact of the contaminant on
the measurements. Additionally, we intended to assess the Mr of viral and subviral particles via native
MS, a technique based on volatilization of analytes via an ES ionization
(ESI) process; their separation is occurring in vacuo. Moreover, no charge reduction takes place, instead analytes carry
multiple charges. Despite these harsher conditions, the structure
of large, noncovalent protein complexes (including viruses) is preserved
during the complete analysis.22,37−40 Finally, it was our intention to extend the Mr/EM diameter correlation previously described for proteins
to the MDa range allowing Mr determination
of globular viruses. Data for spherical virions, as compiled by Pease,21 were included, as indicated in the respective
figures, provided that their Mr values
were accessible from experiments and not calculated by adding the Mr’s of their components. The correlation
established here between EM diameter and Mr for intact, spherical, native viruses now allows one to determine,
via GEMMA, the Mr of viruses in general
with greater precision than has been possible to date.

Materials and
Methods
Analyte and Reagents
HRV-A2 was prepared either according
to standard protocols41 (two preparations)
or, in the case of highly pure virus preparations, according to a
slightly changed protocol including a lipase (porcine pancreas, Sigma-Aldrich)
digestion step (two preparations). In short, HRV-A2 was grown in a
HeLa-H1 cell suspension culture. Repeated freezing/thawing cycles
and pelleting of cell debris allowed recovery of virions from the
supernatant. Subsequent purification steps included (i) pelleting
of virions and (ii) enzymatic removal of contaminating protein, DNA,
and RNA. The highly pure HRV-A2 preparations were obtained by including
a digestion step with 0.2 U/μL lipase at 28 °C overnight
by gently shaking on an Eppendorf thermomixer prior to step (ii).
Finally, (iii), virions were pelleted and submitted to sucrose density
gradient centrifugation. HRV-A2 containing fractions were recovered;
the virus was pelleted via high-speed centrifugation, and the pellet
was resuspended in 50 mM sodium borate (pH 7.4). For a detailed list
of further chemicals as well as proteins employed for setup of a Mr/EM diameter correlation, refer to the Supporting Information.

Buffers and Solutions
CE background electrolyte (BGE)
was 100 mM boric acid adjusted to pH 8.3 via sodium hydroxide and
included 10 mM SDS. Ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) at the indicated
concentrations and pH values was employed as electrolyte for GEMMA
and native ESI MS measurements. BGE and NH4OAc was filtered
through surfactant free cellulose acetate membrane, 0.20 μm
pore size syringe filters (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany).
0.1% TFA was obtained via mixing of a respective volume with water
of Millipore grade. Sinapic acid as MALDI MS matrix was dissolved
at 10 mg/mL in ACN/0.1% TFA (1:1; v/v).

Instrumentation
CE and TEM measurements were carried
out as described elsewhere in detail.41 An additional overview is given in the supplement.

MALDI MS
measurements of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) derivates were carried
out by means of an Axima CFR+ instrument (Shimadzu Kratos
Analytical, Manchester, UK) in the linear, positive ion mode employing
a Coval-X high mass detector (Zürich, Switzerland) and Fleximass
DS MALDI MS targets (Shimadzu). For calibration, bovine γ-globulin
(≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich, 10 pmol/μL in aqueous 0.1% TFA)
was mixed with matrix solution and applied to the MALDI MS target.

In native mass spectrometry experiments, (tandem) mass spectra
were recorded on a modified (MSVision, Almere, The Netherlands) Q-RTOF
(Waters, Manchester, UK) instrument in positive ion mode42 (native mass spectrometry analysis). Xenon was
used as the collision gas to increase the transmission of viral particles.43 Voltages and the pressure of the other gases
were optimized for transmitting large noncovalent protein complexes.44,45 For determination of the Mr of the empty
capsids (B-particles), charges were assigned to the distribution that
resulted in a derived Mr with the smallest
standard deviation. Charge state assignment was further confirmed
by theoretical simulation of the charge state distribution corresponding
to the empty capsid (in absence of both VP4 and RNA) using the software
SOMMS.46

Desalting of HRV-A2 Stock
Solutions and Sample Preparation
Desalting and exchange of
HRV-A2 stock storage buffer for NH4OAc was carried out
as described by using 10 kDa Mr cutoff
spin filters (poly(ether sulfone) membrane from
VWR, Vienna, Austria).27 The HRV-A2 concentration
of the desalted stock was calculated on the basis of (i) the initial
virus concentration determined by CE,41 (ii) sample dilution during desalting, and (iii) neglecting virus
interaction with the membrane (which reduced the amount of a similar
analyte by only roughly 20%). Hence, for simplification, a total recovery
of the analyte from the filter was assumed. The two conventional HRV-A2
preparations used in this report were diluted in 50 mM NH4OAc (pH 8.4) resulting in final virus stocks of 16 and 45 nM particle
concentration, respectively. One of the two highly pure HRV-A2 preparations
was diluted in 50 mM NH4OAc (pH 8.4) and the other one
in 10 mM NH4OAc (pH 9.5), yielding final virus concentrations
of 3 and 16 nM, respectively. We did not observe any influence of
NH4OAc concentrations and pH values on virus stability
or recovery during desalting. Further details concerning the preparation
of samples is given in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
It was one of the aims of the
current study to (i) prepare HRV-A2
of high purity, (ii) to check its behavior in comparison to virus
preparations obtained via our conventional conditions, and (iii) to
employ this highly pure HRV-A2 for GEMMA and native MS measurements,
both based on an electrospray process, for the establishment of a Mr/EM diameter calibration curve applicable for
virus Mr determination.

Preparation of Highly Pure
HRV-A2 and Its Analysis via GEMMA
The contaminant present
in conventional HRV-A2 preparations gave
rise to a broad, heterogeneous peak in the GEMMA spectra; this and
other unpublished data led us to assume that it was composed of lipid
membrane fragments originating from host cells.27 Indeed, GEMMA revealed that the corresponding peak was
greatly diminished upon lipase digestion (Figure 1a), whereas the HRV-A2 peak was unchanged.
Concomitant with the disappearance of the contaminating high Mr material, low Mr material with up to 16 nm EM diameter increased and most probably
represents digested membrane fragments, enzyme aggregates, and/or
buffer components of the added enzyme. TEM imaging underscores the
GEMMA results and upon lipase digestion, the amount of irregularly
shaped material (i.e., the contaminant) seen in the original sample
(Figure 1b, enlarged
in inset) was significantly reduced (Figure 1c). HRV-A2 particles (bright spheres indicated
by arrows) were unaffected by the enzyme treatment.

Figure 1 GEMMA spectra demonstrate
that the contaminant of HRV-A2 preparations
is sensitive to lipase digestion (a). Thyroglobulin is added as internal
standard to allow easy comparison of spectra. TEM analysis of samples
prior (b) and after digestion (c) with lipase; cloud-shaped contaminant
(Cont.) material (enlarged in inset of (b)) disappears upon enzymatic
treatment. Intact virions (marked by white arrows in TEM images) are
not affected by digestion (100 nm size bar).

The EM diameter distribution of the contaminant, as seen
in GEMMA,
varied strongly between HRV-A2 batches giving rise to different broad
peaks.27 We were not interested in the
chemical nature of this component but rather concentrated on how to
obtain HRV-A2 of the highest possible purity.

To remove the
contaminant, we modified the conventional virus preparation
protocol;41 an additional lipase digestion
step was included prior to the sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation
(see Materials and Methods section). As demonstrated
in the GEMMA measurements depicted in Figure 2a, the modified protocol yielded virus of
exceptional purity; no contaminating material was detectable.

Figure 2 GEMMA and CE
analyses of HRV-A2 preparations. (a) GEMMA spectra
demonstrate that lipase digestion results in virus of high purity
(components and products of the enzymatic digest are removed during
the virus preparation process itself in contrast to Figure 1). (b) CE does not distinguish
a conventional virus preparation (see ref (41)) from a preparation involving lipase digestion
(an exemplary electropherogram of the latter is shown).

We then compared two highly pure HRV-A2 preparations
with batches
obtained via the previously used standard purification protocol. (i)
The virus concentrations of two highly pure preparations (1.1 ±
0.1 and 3.9 ± 0.6 mg/mL virions, n = 3, respectively)
as determined via CE41 (exemplary electropherogram
in Figure 2b, top)
were comparable to that of conventional preparations.41 (ii) Upon incubation for 10 min at 56 °C in BGE,47 CE resolved the four VPs and the viral RNA genome
(exemplary electropherogram in Figure 2b, bottom); the CE profiles of all four batches were
again indistinguishable. (iii) The specific infectivity (TCID50/mL; 2.31 × 1011 and 4.14 × 1011, respectively) was essentially the same for all four batches. From
the number of intact virions (calculated from CE) and the number of
infective particles (TCID50/mL), the ratio of infective
virions and the number of particles were calculated and were again
very similar for batches prepared by either protocol. From these data,
we conclude that the additional lipase incubation had no significant
influence on virus yield and infectivity; only the contaminant was
removed.

GEMMA Analysis of HRV-A2 Subviral Particles
Incubation
of HRV-A2 at 56 °C or at acidic pH leads to formation of subviral
A-particles and empty virions (B-particles) and, in the presence of
SDS, to dissociation into individual components, the viral capsid
proteins and the genomic RNA.27,41,48 The (nonphysiologic) heating is believed to lead to unordered exit
of the RNA genome instead of the well-coordinated release observed
under close-to in vivo conditions.34 Nevertheless, empty capsids were electrophoretically indistinguishable
regardless of whether they were prepared via heating or exposure to
acidic pH, as in the endosomal compartment during infection of host
cells.27 Therefore, to minimize matrix
effects, we prepared empty capsids via heating of the purified virus.

A-particles, as well as empty capsids (B-particles), are expanded
by about 4% in comparison to native virions.33,34 Employing a commercial GEMMA as well as a custom-built instrument,
we were able to measure the corresponding particles. However, due
to the higher peak resolution, i.e., the full width at half maximum
(fwhm) of the peak recorded for native virions was reduced by a factor
of 3, which is brought about by a higher laminar sheath flow in the
DMA unit;11 we only present spectra obtained
with the custom-built instrument (Figure 3). On incubation of HRV-A2 at 56 °C
for 10 min, the original virus
peak (containing particles as visualized by TEM) disappeared. Concomitantly,
a new peak appeared. However, instead of the expected 4% increase
in diameter, the position of the new peak rather corresponds to about
a 2% decrease of the EM diameter (from 29.3 to 28.7 nm). Examination
of the heated virus with negative stain TEM (Figure 3, inset) clearly identified it as (empty)
B-particles. Interestingly, another subviral particle was found to
possess a 5% larger EM diameter (30.6 nm); it likely corresponds to
the A-particle with the same composition as the B-particle except
that it still contains the RNA genome. With incubation of HRV-A2 at
56 °C, the conversion into empty shells appears not to be complete
and A-particles are present to a minor extent.

Figure 3 GEMMA analysis of viral
and subviral particles on a custom-built
instrument with high peak resolution allows for the separation of
intact virions and subviral A- and empty B-particles. Spectra of three
different samples containing mostly native virions (red), a substantial
fraction of A-particles (blue), and mostly B-particles (green) are
shown. The insets show TEM images of corresponding particles (100
nm size bar).

On the basis of X-ray
crystallography and cryo-EM image reconstruction,
A- and B-particles have the same diameter in contrast to GEMMA results
as presented in the preceding paragraph. Kaddis et al.13 suggested that analytes in the course of GEMMA
measurements are compressed upon transition to the gas-phase and hence
exhibit a slightly lower EM diameter than in solution. These researchers
also observed that components present within the protein assemblies
(e.g., iron cores in ferritin) exert a stabilizing effect and thereby
influence the observed EM diameters. Particles lacking these stabilizers
appear smaller in GEMMA than their stabilized counterparts of the
same Mr. The presence of RNA in A-particles,
which exhibit a higher sedimentation constant (135S) in comparison
to that of the empty B-particle (80S), might significantly decrease
the shrinking of 135S particles upon transfer to the gas-phase (keep
in mind that both subviral particles showed the same diameter in X-ray
crystallography and cryo-EM). The well-documented expansion of the
A-particle with respect to the native virus is clearly detected by
GEMMA despite its lower Mr due to lack
of VP4, corresponding to ∼450 kDa in total (consider that the
particle with lower Mr exhibits the larger
EM diameter). The EM diameter increase of the A-particle, but not
of the B-particle, is thus in good accordance with the data derived
from X-ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy.33,34 The additional peaks with lower EM diameters (25.1 and 26.8 nm,
respectively) might correspond to partially uncoated virions, broken
capsids, or shells lacking a pentamer.

On the basis of the above
results, we asked whether extrapolation
of only one regression curve similar to the one presented by Bacher
et al. for protein standards3 might allow
one to obtain Mr values from EM diameter
data for various viral and subviral analytes (see final section of Results and Discussion).

Native ESI MS
To correlate GEMMA-derived EM diameters
with experimentally determined Mr’s
(instead of calculating them from the respective components), we attempted
to determine the Mr of native viral 150S
and subviral 80S particles by means of native MS (Figure 4). Fortunately, for both highly
purified particles, we obtained Gaussian-shaped
distributions of m/z values at very
high m/z values. For the empty B-particles,
charge state resolution of the distribution was obtained, a prerequisite
for the Mr calculation from the experimental
data. The charge state resolution could only be obtained from virus
batches of high purity as produced with prior lipase digestion.

Figure 4 Positive ion
mass spectra (native ESI MS) of (a) native HRV-A2
and (b) empty HRV-A2 capsids (B-particles). For the latter, charge
state resolution can be obtained and a Mr calculated.

In contrast, native viral
particles seem to be more heterogeneous;
this heterogeneity might result from (i) differences in the length
of the 3′ poly(A) tail of the viral genome or (ii) cations
like polyamines that are taken up during virus assembly to neutralize
excess charge of the anionic RNA. Therefore, an exact Mr determination via ESI MS was not possible; however,
an average m/z value of 31 251
was obtained. Even incubation of virions for 4 h at 37 °C in
NH4OAc (conditions inducing viral breathing49 to exchange encapsulated material for ammonium
ions via diffusion) did not lead to increased charge state resolution.
We thus assume that the differently sized poly(A) in intact virions
are at the origin of these problems.

The Mr of (empty) B-particles was calculated
to be 5210 ± 2 kDa from the native MS data. This is in perfect
accordance with the theoretical value obtained by addition of the Mr values of 60 copies of each of the capsid
proteins VP1 to VP3 (polyprotein P04936 from www.uniprot.org, vers. 157 from July 9, 2014, calculation via www.expasy.org) resulting in a value of 5209.5 kDa. To our knowledge, this is the
first native MS-based Mr determination
of intact HRV empty capsids.

We also investigated the stability
of the empty capsids (Figure 5a) by probing their
dissociation into VPs as a function of the collision energies employed
in CID experiments (Figure 5b). Less stable particles are likely to dissociate at lower
collision energies (and to a greater extent). Figure 5c demonstrates that VP1 readily dissociates
from the empty viral shell suggesting that the VP1-interactions with
its neighbors are weakened during virus uncoating. VP2 dissociates
to a lesser extent, which could indicate that it is more strongly
bound to its neighbors. In contrast, CID experiments performed on
the native virion, instead, identified VP1 as undergoing the lowest
level of dissociation (data not shown). It is thus likely that VP1
is more strongly bound to its symmetry-related copies than the other
subunits of the virion, and the RNA genome. The latter is consistent
with its reported interaction with the encapsulated nucleic acid.34

Figure 5 Positive ion CID analysis of empty HRV-A2 capsids (B-particles).
At higher collision energies (example for 300 V is presented, (a)),
the particles undergo gas-phase dissociation into the component VPs.
Enlargement of the m/z region corresponding
to the dissociated subunits (b) identifies VP1 (blue), VP2 (green),
and VP3 (red). Ions in the respective distributions are indicated
by “∗” and in some cases with their charge states.
The relative signal intensity of the free VPs with respect to that
of empty capsids (violet) at different collision energies (c) provides
information pertaining to the relative stability (i.e., binding strength)
of the respective VP within the subviral assembly.

Mr/EM Diameter
Correlation
We set up a protein-based EM diameter/Mr correlation (corrnew) as displayed
in Figure 6 (see Figure S3 for experimental data). Data on other virus particles as
described in the literature and compiled in ref (21) were included in corrnew given that (i) they are spherical, (ii) the EM diameter
values were reported from at least two individual sources, and (iii) Mr values had been accessed experimentally. Applying
these criteria, data points for phage MS215,16,50−56 and rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV)15,53,57 were included in corrnew which had a value
of y = 0.03062x3.67155. For
values below 15 nm EM diameter, this correlation and the composite
curve described by Bacher et al.3 are in
very good accordance. However, since the newly recorded curve includes
a higher number of proteins larger than 0.5 MDa, as well as two viruses,
a steeper increase of corrnew was obtained upon extrapolation
to higher Mr values. Already for native
HRV-A2 (29.9 ± 0.4 nm EM diameter), this resulted in differences
of about 34% Mr. Corrnew yielded Mr values much closer to the theoretical Mr of HRV-A2, ≥8085 kDa according to ref (3), than to the correlation
previously reported (7982 kDa for corrnew vs 5251 kDa as
reported by Bacher et al.3). The theoretical Mr of intact HRV-A2 is about 1.3% higher than
the value calculated via corrnew.

Figure 6 Mr/EM diameter correlation (corrnew) for proteins
and two native virions (MS2 and RYMV). Inclusion
of data points stemming from two viruses leads to a significant deviation
of corrnew from a protein-based correlation.3 The Mr value for
HRV-A2, as derived from its EM diameter using corrnew (7982
kDa), deviates from the calculated sum of the Mr’s of its building blocks (8085 kDa) by only ±0.64%
of an arithmetic mean. Data points for empty HRV-A2 viral capsids
are deviating significantly from the protein/virus particle-based
correlation curve.

Data points for empty
HRV-A2 (B-particles) as well as intermediate
particles (135S) showed a considerable deviation from corrnew. This observation is of special importance for GEMMA measurements
of viruses and subviral particles as considerations about the particle
size and structure, especially concerning the stabilizing effect of
the nucleic acid on the viral capsids, will allow Mr determination via GEMMA with increased accuracy.

Concluding
Remarks
Addition of a lipase digestion step to our conventional
HRV preparation
protocol allowed for removal of a troublesome contamination always
present to various degrees in our previous virus preparations. The
highly pure virus obtained thereby was used for gas-phase electrophoretic
mobility molecular analysis on a commercial GEMMA as well as on a
custom-built instrument (with higher nano DMA resolution) to analyze
the native virus as well as its derived subviral particles. For the
first time, we also successfully measured the same particles with
native ESI MS. In the case of empty virions (B-particles), the resolution
of charged states allowed for calculation of their Mr from the experimental data. The value fitted perfectly
to the theoretically predicted Mr as calculated
from the sum of the Mr’s of its
building blocks. Plotting Mr versus EM
diameter of empty HRV-A2, we observed a clear deviation from the correlation
curve (corrnew) obtained from proteins and two spherical
viruses. It is of importance that (i) corrnew already deviates
from the Mr/EM diameter correlation based
on proteins alone3 and (ii) the theoretically
predicted Mr of intact HRV-A2 virions
fits exceptionally well to corrnew. Thus, corrnew describes an improvement of correlations from the literature for
native virus particles. The deviation of the theoretically predicted Mr value of HRV-A2 and the value calculated from
its EM diameter via corrnew lay within ±0.64% of an
arithmetic mean.

Regarding the expanded intermediates of HRV-A2
uncoating, we observed
that the A-particle, that still contains the RNA but has a slightly
reduced Mr because of loss of 60 copies
of VP4, also exhibited a larger EM diameter than the intact virus.
However, the empty B-particle, whose diameter is, based on X-ray and
electron microscopy, identical to that of the A-particle had a much
smaller EM diameter. It is thus obvious that various factors might
influence the experimentally derived EM diameters of viruses and subviral
particles. EM diameters are based on (i) the particle diameter per se, but (ii) the 3D-structure of the capsids (tight
native virions vs porous uncoating intermediates) and (iii) encapsulated
nucleic acid have to be taken into consideration as they might have
profound effects on the transition of the particle into the gas-phase
and its subsequent movement in the high laminar flow under the influence
of a strong electric field.

The question, if protein standards
can indeed be combined with
viruses (a highly structured assembly of proteins and nucleic acids)
to obtain a Mr/EM diameter correlation,
cannot, at the moment, be answered finally. Neither proteins of sufficiently
high Mr nor viruses of sufficiently low Mr are available for analysis in the necessary
quality. Therefore, the combination of these two analyte classes appears
reasonable for setting up a Mr/EM diameter
correlation. Given that geometrical (spherical shape) as well as structural
(native, compact virions composed of protein and RNA vs empty protein
shells) constraints are regarded, GEMMA allows the Mr determination of analytes or bionanoparticles, which
are not accessible via classical native MS approaches.
