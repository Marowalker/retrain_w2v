We
present an extension of the well-known slopes method for characterization of the
in-plane thermal diffusivity of semitransparent polymer films. We
introduce a theoretical model which considers heat losses due to convection
and radiation mechanisms, as well as semitransparency of the material
to the exciting laser heat source (visible range) and multiple reflections
at the film surfaces. Most importantly, a potential semitransparency
of the material in the IR detection range is also considered. We prove
by numerical simulations and by an asymptotic expansion of the surface
temperature that the slopes method is also valid for any semitransparent
film in the thermally thin regime. Measurements of the in-plane thermal
diffusivity performed on semitransparent polymer films covering a
wide range of absorption coefficients (to the exciting wavelength
and in the IR detection range of our IR camera) validate our theoretical
findings.

==== Body
Lock-in thermography is a well-known
technique for accurate determination of the in-plane thermal diffusivity
of solids.1−4 In recent decades, it has attracted the attention of scientists
due to its noncontact and noninvasive attributes. Moreover, lock-in
thermography has shown versatility for materials characterization,
in nondestructive testing and evaluation as well as in biomedical
applications.5,6 In particular, for thermal characterization
of isotropic solids, the “slopes method”2,7 has been widely used. Therefore, a freestanding sample is periodically
heated by a focused optical source. The temperature oscillations as
a function of the radial coordinate are detected, typically using
an infrared (IR) camera. The thermographic signal (amplitude T and phase Ψ) is either derived from the front-face2 or the rear-face configuration,1 i.e., from the nonilluminated face. The thermographic signals
(ln(amplitude) and phase) far from the heating spot vary linearly
with radial distance under the precondition of isotropic opaque thin
films in the thermally thin regime (film thickness ≪ thermal
diffusion length). Moreover, the product between the amplitude slope
and the phase slope is independent of convective and radiative heat
losses. Consequently, it can be used for the determination of the
thermal diffusivity of a film if heat conduction to the gas is negligible.1,8 Thus, the slopes method is well-suited for measurement of the in-plane
thermal diffusivity of high thermal conductors,4,9−11 whereas it overestimates the in-plane thermal diffusivity
of low thermal conductors.1 This overestimate
is produced by the large conductive heat losses from the low conductor
surface to the surrounding gas. However, the overestimation can be
avoided by measuring the sample under vacuum conditions.

Even
though the characterization of opaque samples using lock-in
thermography has been widely explored, there is almost no attempt
in the literature considering the study of semitransparent samples
without a coating.2 Instead, for measuring
the in-plane thermal diffusivity of semitransparent films, it is recommended
to coat the sample with a thin opaque layer to be able to use the
opaque lock-in models. However, there are some cases in which coating
the semitransparent material is not an option. For these applications,
such as in situ monitoring of the thermal properties evolution of
a polymer film or fiber under stretching, a complete model is required
which takes into account the effects of the film semitransparency
(to the excitation wavelength and in the infrared range of the IR
detector or camera) on the thermographic signal.

In this work,
we extend the use of lock-in thermography to the
measurement of the in-plane thermal diffusivity of semitransparent
thin films of isotropic low thermally conductive materials (such as
polymers) without coating. A 2D heat conduction model is considered,
which includes heat losses to the surrounding atmosphere, semitransparency
of the sample to the exciting wavelength, multiple reflections at
the sample surfaces, as well as the effect of its semitransparency
through the IR window of the IR camera used.

In addition to
our theoretical work, we performed thermal diffusivity
measurements with a home-built lock-in thermography setup. We used
three different polymers covering a wide range of absorption properties:
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), low-density polyethylene (LDPE),
and polyether ether ketone (PEEK). We chose PMMA as the material because
of its low absorption of visible light and high absorption of IR radiation.
Thin LDPE films show semitransparency in both the visible and relevant
IR wavelength range. We tuned the optical properties of these two
materials with the addition of a red dye. The purchased PEEK films
are also low absorbers of the visible light. Since their absorption
of IR radiation depends on the sample thickness, we measured PEEK
films with four different thicknesses.

Modeling
Heat Conduction through a Semitransparent
Film
Consider
a semitransparent film of thickness L, heated by
a focused Gaussian laser of wavelength λ and power P0 modulated at frequency f. The focused
beam has the radius a (measured at 1/e2). In addition, this film is thermally isotropic and is in a vacuum.
Under this circumstance, heat conduction to the surrounding air can
be neglected in the model. Figure 1 shows the described situation.

Figure 1 Semitransparent film
heated by a focused, modulated Gaussian laser
beam. The black arrows indicate heat losses to the environment.

The surface temperature at z = 0 (front-face temperature)
can be expressed as (a detailed derivation is provided in the Supporting Information) 1  where ω = 2πf, r is the radial coordinate, and K is the
thermal conductivity of the film. F includes
the effect of the IR emissivity, sensor area, IR detection range,
and the derivative of the Planck distribution at room temperature. R is the reflectance, and α is the absorption coefficient
of the film, both taken at the laser wavelength. γ is an effective
IR absorption coefficient, which averages the IR absorption over the
detection range of our IR camera. δ is the Hankel space variable; J0(·) is the Bessel function of zero order,
and . D is the thermal diffusivity
of the film. All coefficients A0, A1, B0, B1, and E0 are computed explicitly
in the Supporting Information, in terms
of the thermal diffusivity, modulation frequency, heat convective–radiative
losses, and optical absorption.

The surface temperature at z = L (rear-face temperature) reads 2  The integrals in eqs 1 and 2 cannot
be solved in a closed form, not even in the thermally thin regime
(μ ≫ L), i.e., when the thermal diffusion
length  is much larger than the actual
thickness
of the film (L). Thus, it is hard to prove the validity
of the slopes method for semitransparent films. Up to now, it has
been confirmed for the optically opaque case.1

However, it is reliable to do numerical simulations to show
the
validity of the slopes method for semitransparent films in the thermally
thin regime. In this work, we perform simulations for the rear-face
configuration, which corresponds to our experimental setup. Moreover,
in the thermally thin regime, we have shown the numerical equivalence
between the front-face and rear-face temperatures (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).

Mendioroz et al.1 showed that the radial
temperature profile for an optically opaque film in the thermally
thin regime far from the punctual heating spot (a = 0) can be written as 3  where  and h is the combined
coefficient due to convection and radiation losses. From eq 3, it can be shown that the slopes
method (product of the amplitude and phase slopes) gives the thermal
diffusivity of the film, overcoming the effect of the heat losses.
In general, for a given complex number , such that , ω and D are positive
real numbers. It is straightforward to show that the product of its
real part  and its imaginary part  is independent of u, i.e., .

On the other hand, the asymptotic
behavior of the Hankel integrals
involved in eqs 1 and 2 can be explored.12,13

Consider
a Hankel integral of zero order 4a  This is an
asymptotic expansion
that when b → ∞ can be expressed as12 4b  where the
first term (infinite
summation) is the Poincaré asymptotic expansion (PAE) of the
integral in eq 4a and
is a series expansion containing integer powers of 1/b. ϕs(0) represents
the sth derivative of ϕ(x)
evaluated at x = 0, and Γ(·) is the gamma
function. The second term takes into account the exponentially small
decaying terms of the integral. For odd functions ϕ(− x) = −ϕ(x), the PAE equals
zero, and only the exponentially small terms are relevant for the
asymptotic expansion. The Δ0(b)
term can be obtained using the McClure–Wong distributional
method.13 For meromorphic functions, as
is our case, it reads 5  where H0(1)(·) is the
Hankel function of first class and zero order. Res{f(z); z = aj} stands for the residues of f(z) evaluated at z = aj, and aj is the jth pole of ϕ(z2) located in the upper half of the complex
plane.

Consider a semitransparent film, in the thermally thin
regime,
illuminated by a punctual laser source (a = 0). The
asymptotic expansion of the front-face thermographic signal S(r → ∞, 0, ω) can
be obtained by computation of the residues appearing the integral
in eq 1. The terms which
contain poles in eq 1 are linear combinations of 6  Following eq 5 we obtain 7  where ,  and . Note that if the three real parts are
of the same order of magnitude, then the expression in eq 7 reduces to a single exponential
decaying term 8  where  and u is a combination
of α, γ, and 2h/(KL).
This means that the slopes method holds for this particular case.
On the other hand, if any of the real parts are larger than the others,
the corresponding term in eq 7 can be dropped, because its amplitude is exponentially small
with respect to the others. Accordingly, eq 7 always can be reduced to eq 8 for a suitable value of u. As mentioned before, the value of u does
not influence the product of the real and imaginary parts of σ.
Thus, we have shown that the slopes method  is also
applicable for semitransparent
films in the thermally thin regime, using a punctual excitation source.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(methyl methacrylate)
Plexiglas 7N (PMMA;
Evonik), low-density polyethylene Purell PE 1840H (LDPE; LyondellBasell),
tetrahydrofuran (THF; >99.9%; Sigma-Aldrich), and phenol red (PR;
Alfa Aesar) were used as received. Amorphous polyether ether ketone
(PEEK) films with a thickness of 25, 50, 75, and 250 μm were
purchased from www.goodfellow.com; potassium bromide (KBr) round cell windows were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation of Thin, Freestanding Films for Lock-In Thermography
Freestanding PMMA films were prepared from solution. Therefore,
30 wt % PMMA was dissolved in THF under magnetic stirring. To obtain
red PMMA films 2 and 6 wt % PR (with regard to the amount of PMMA),
respectively, were added to PMMA before dissolution in THF. Then,
the PMMA solution was cast on a glass substrate using the doctor-blade
method. After drying for 48 h, the film was removed from the glass
substrate and cut into pieces of appropriate sizes. The thickness
of the PMMA films was around 200 μm. The fabrication of the
freestanding LDPE films is composed of the following steps: compounding,
injection molding, and hot pressing. First, LDPE pellets and PR powder
were mixed under N2 flow in a twin-screw compounder with
a stirring speed of 40 rpm and at a temperature of 200 °C. Second,
the compounded material was directly filled into the injection unit.
Discs with a diameter of ∼27 mm and a thickness of ∼1
mm were fabricated using an injection force of 6 kN and a tool temperature
of 20 °C. Finally, thin, freestanding LDPE films were obtained
by hot pressing of the discs at a temperature of 200 °C and subsequent
cooling to room temperature. In this way, LDPE films with 0, 2, and
6 wt % PR, respectively, were prepared. The thickness of the LDPE
films was around 200 μm. Photographs of the PMMA and LDPE thin
films with various contents of PR are depicted in Figures S3 and S4. PEEK films were cleaned and cut into pieces.

Characterization Methods
In-plane thermal diffusivity
measurements on thin, freestanding films (∼ 200 μm) were
conducted using a home-built lock-in thermography (LIT) setup (Figure S4). The sample was heated by a laser
beam (Genesis MX 488-1000 SLM OPS, Coherent, λ = 488.1 nm) focused
onto the sample surface by a lens of 150 mm focal length. The amplitude
of the laser was modulated in sine waveform using a Rigol waveform
generator DG1022A. The emitted infrared (IR) radiation of the sample
surface is detected by an Infratec VarioCAM HD research IR camera
(7.5–14 μm). The camera is equipped with a close-up lens.
In this configuration, the minimum spatial resolution is 29 μm
at a working distance of 33 mm. To avoid heat losses due to conduction
and convection into the environment, all samples were measured under
vacuum conditions (∼3 × 10–3 mbar).
However, heat losses due to radiation still remain. LIT measurements
were performed using Infratec’s IRBISactiveonline software.
Transparent samples (PMMA and LDPE without phenol red as well as all
PEEK films) were coated with a 20 nm carbon layer for enhanced laser
absorption. The coating of the sample was facing the infrared camera.
The influence of the carbon coating on the absorption of light in
the IR and UV–vis range is shown in Figure S6. In the case of the fabricated polymeric films (PMMA and
LDPE), we measured three different films per sample; in the case of
the purchased PEEK films, we measured only one film per sample.

UV–vis measurements were conducted on an Agilent Cary 5000
spectrometer in the transmission mode. Absorption spectra were recorded
from 380 to 800 nm. The data interval was fixed to 1 nm, with averaging
for 100 ms. Each measured sample was normalized with a suitable reference
(control): For the freestanding polymers, the direct lamp spectrum
in air was used. For the measurement of the carbon coating, an uncoated
KBr disc was used. The phenol red powder was measured by applying
a thin layer on transparent adhesive tape with the same tape as reference.
The same polymeric samples as characterized by lock-in thermography
were investigated.

A Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer was
used for absorption spectra
acquisition. The polymeric samples, as well as a carbon-coated KBr
window, were measured in transmission mode. To get the IR absorbance
of the pure carbon layer, an uncoated KBr window with the same thickness
as the uncoated one was used as a reference. Furthermore, an ATR-IR
spectrum of phenol red powder was recorded. All samples were measured
in the wavenumber range of the spectral range of the infrared camera
(data interval, 4 cm–1; averaging, 32 measurements).

Results and Discussion
Numerical Simulations
Here we present
numerical simulations
of the radial temperature profiles based on eq 2. A thin polymeric film (K = 0.15 W m–1 K–1, D = 0.10 mm2 s–1) with thickness L = 25 μm is considered. The laser power is set to P0 = 50 mW at a modulation frequency f = 0.10 Hz. This gives a thermal diffusion length μ
= 564 μm; i.e., the film is in the thermally thin regime (μ
≫ L). A typical value is used for the combined
heat transfer coefficient h = 15 W m–2 K–1.8,14

Figure 2a shows simulations of a surface
temperature radial profile for a semitransparent film, considering
a fixed IR absorption coefficient such that γL = 5. The absorption coefficient to the incident laser wavelength
is varied over a wide range: 0.01 ≤ αL ≤ 100. The laser beam is focused on the film surface with
a radius a = 0.1μ. The temperature profiles
for the “amplitude”  and phase Ψ are presented with a
vertical shift and in ascending order of αL from top to bottom.

Figure 2 (a) Plots of  (continuous lines) and Ψ (dashed
lines) as a function of the normalized radial profile w = r/μ. A wide range of absorption coefficients
is explored at a fixed IR absorption: γL =
5. (b) Derivatives of amplitudes (continuous lines) and phases (dashed
lines) with respect to w, for different absorption
coefficients, are explored. Note that results overlap. (c) Plots of  (continuous lines) and Ψ (dashed
lines) as a function of the normalized radial profile w = r/μ. A wide range of IR absorption coefficients
is explored at a fixed optical absorption: αL = 5. (d) Derivatives of amplitudes (continuous lines) and phases
(dashed lines) with respect to w, for the different
IR absorption coefficients, are explored. Note that the results overlap.

The derivatives of the “amplitude”  and phase ∂wΨ with respect to the normalized radial
profile are antisymmetric around the beam spot position (r = 0), as depicted in Figure 2b. Both derivatives reach a constant value above r = 2μ (and below r = −2μ), as
indicated by the red arrows. Thus, |r| ≥ 2μ
corresponds to the linear part of the temperature profiles shown in Figure 2a. Two red arrows
mark these intervals. Within the region 0 ≤ r ≤ 2μ, the amplitude derivative shows a concave upward
behavior and is discontinuous at r = 0. This discontinuity
is due to the logarithmic function. In contrast, the phase derivative
is concave downward away from the beam spot; it shows an abrupt change
to concave upward near r = 0 and is continuous at
the beam spot position. Moreover, the values of the derivatives for
the different absorption coefficients to the exciting wavelength are
equal, as they are all superimposed in Figure 2b. This means that the difference between
the slopes of the amplitude  and phase Ψ profiles (for |r| ≥ 2μ)
is due to the heat losses independent
of αL.

Simulations presented in Figure 2c are similar to
those in Figure 2a,
but in this case, the optical absorption
coefficient to the exciting wavelength is fixed (αL = 5), and a wide range of IR absorption coefficients are explored:
0.01 ≤ γL ≤ 100. The same radius a = 0.1μ is used for the focused beam. The simulations
are vertically shifted in ascending order of γL from top to bottom.

The corresponding “amplitude”
and phase derivatives
are shown in Figure 2d. The same characteristics as described in Figure 2b are found. In this case, the values of
the derivatives for the different IR absorption coefficients are equal,
as they are all superimposed. This means that the difference between
the slopes of the amplitude  and phase Ψ profiles is also due
to the heat losses, independent of γL. To validate
the above results, further simulations for a wide range of both absorption
coefficients were performed (see Supporting Information).

We have found that the product between the amplitude derivative  and phase derivative ∂wΨ, for |r | ≥
μ, is constant and independent of the optical absorption to
the exciting wavelength and to the optical absorption in the IR detection
range; i.e., this result is also correct in the optically opaque limit.
Consequently, on the basis of the slopes method for optically opaque
films in the thermally thin regime,1 we
conclude that, for any semitransparent or opaque film in the thermally
thin regime and far from the excitation beam spot, |r| ≥ μ: 9  This confirms our theoretical
expectation as outlined above.

Lock-In Thermography Measurements
To validate our theoretical
results experimentally, we measured three different polymers covering
a wide range of IR absorption coefficients and optical absorption
coefficients to the exciting wavelength: poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polyether ether ketone
(PEEK). To tune the optical properties of PMMA and LDPE, we added
2 and 6 wt % phenol red (PR), respectively (Figure S3). Furthermore, PEEK films with different thicknesses, i.e.,
25, 50, 75, and 250 μm, were investigated.

In Figure 3a, a plot of the
IR absorption (AIR = γL/ln(10)) as a function of the optical absorption (AVis = αL/ln(10)) to the exciting
wavelength of all samples is shown. In Table 1, the corresponding values are listed. Furthermore,
the samples are classified in “semitransparent” or “opaque”
regarding their optical properties to the exciting laser light and
IR radiation.

Figure 3 (a) Plot of AIR versus AVis of all polymeric thin films. The error bars
of AIR arise from measuring three films
per sample
(except for PEEK) and from averaging over the spectral wavelength
range of the infrared camera (7.5–14 μm); the error bars
of AVis arise from measuring three films
per sample (except for PEEK). Area I marks the (semi)transparent AVis and AIR range, and area II marks
the opaque AVis range and (semi)transparent AIR range. Area III marks the (semi)transparent AVis range and opaque AIR range, and area IV marks the opaque AVis and AIR range. Exemplary (b)
IR and (c) UV–vis absorbance spectra of LDPE with 0, 2, and
6 wt % phenol red (PR) as well as the spectra of pure PR powder are
shown. The dashed line at 488 nm marks the wavelength of the incident
laser used in lock-in measurements.

Figure 3a is divided
into four areas dependent on the optical properties of the material:(I) (semi)transparent
to both IR radiation
in the wavelength range of the IR camera (7.5–14 μm)
and the exciting wavelength of the laser (488 nm),

(II) (semi)transparent to the IR radiation
and opaque to the exciting wavelength,

(III) opaque to the IR radiation and (semi)transparent
to the exciting wavelength, and

(IV) opaque to both IR radiation and exciting
wavelength.



As can be seen from this
plot, PMMA is opaque to IR radiation and
semitransparent (III) or opaque (IV) to the exciting laser light depending
on the dye concentration. LDPE, on the other hand, is semitransparent
to IR radiation and semitransparent (I) or opaque, due to a higher
PR content, (II) to the exciting laser light. Here, the addition of
PR enhances not only the absorbance of visible light (Figure 3b) but also the absorbance
of IR light (Figure 3c). All PEEK films are semitransparent to the exciting laser light,
but either semitransparent (I) or opaque (III) to the IR radiation
depending on the sample thickness. IR and UV–vis absorbance
spectra of all samples are summarized in Figure S7.

Exemplary lock-in thermography (LIT) measurement
data of PMMA with
various PR contents (0, 2, 6 wt % PR) are depicted in Figure 4a. Here, temperature profiles
for the “amplitude”  and phase Ψ are shown for a lock-in
frequency f of 0.219 Hz. To be independent of the
optical properties of the thin films, we extracted the phase and “amplitude”
slopes above a radial distance of 2μ (vertical dashed lines
in Figure 4a). Subsequently,
we calculated the thermal diffusivity D for each
frequency using the equation . Fits were done on radial averaged profiles
for each phase and amplitude image. In this way, the whole phase and
amplitude distribution are evaluated rather than single lines. Figure 4b shows the individual
thermal diffusivities with dependence on the used lock-in frequency.
The error bars arise from the fitting of the radial profiles. From
this data, an average thermal diffusivity is calculated (dashed line).
The data in Figure 4b indicates that the PMMA films have similar thermal diffusivities
independent of the PR content. Therefore, the slopes method is valid
independent of the optical absorption at the exciting wavelength.
However, the standard error of the individual thermal diffusivities
is larger for the sample without PR due to the lower signal-to-noise
ratio of the radial profiles.

0, 2, and 6 wt %
phenol red (PR), respectively. (a) Plots of  (continuous lines) and Ψ (dashed
lines) as a function of the radial profile r. The
vertical dashed lines at 2μ (∼800 μm) represent
the lower fitting boundary used for evaluation of the phase and amplitude
profiles. (b) Plots of the thermal diffusivity D against
the lock-in frequency f. Error bars are the standard
error arising from the fitting of the radial profiles. The dashed
lines represent the respective average value.

The thermal diffusivities determined by LIT are shown in Figure 5. We measured PMMA
and LDPE films with 0, 2, and 6 wt % of PR content. Additionally,
four PEEK samples with different thicknesses were measured. For all
samples, we obtained rather small standard deviations of the thermal
diffusivity. In Figure 5, we plot an uncertainty of 5% as error bars.1,15

diffusivity D of PMMA (black bars) and
LDPE (blue bars) with 0, 2, and 6 wt % phenol red (PR), respectively.
Error bars are 5% uncertainty. The dashed lines represent the lower
and upper limits of the reference values for unmodified PMMA and LDPE.15 The thermal diffusivities of PEEK films with
a thickness of 25, 50, 75, and 250 μm are plotted as green bars.
Error bars are 5% uncertainty. The corresponding solid line represents
the literature value also measured with lock-in thermography. The
dashed lines are the 5% uncertainty range given by Mendioroz et al.1

From our lock-in measurements, we determined an in-plane
thermal
diffusivity of ∼0.12 mm2 s–1 for
PMMA independent of the PR content. Thus, the result does not depend
on the optical absorption coefficient to the exciting wavelength that
changes from semitransparent to opaque with an increasing amount of
red dye (Table 1).
Similarly, for LDPE with 0, 2, and 6 wt % PR, we found a thermal diffusivity
of ∼0.19 mm2s–1. Here, too, we
observe no dependence on the optical absorption coefficient for the
exciting laser light (Table 1).

We obtained an average thermal diffusivity value
of ∼0.20
mm2 s–1 for all PEEK samples independent
of the film thickness. Consequently, the result is not affected by
the IR absorption coefficients that change from semitransparent to
opaque with increasing film thickness (Table 1). The PEEK films also serve as reference
material for our LIT setup, since literature values are available
that were also measured with thermographic methods.1,16 The
literature value of 0.19 mm2 s–1 from
Mendioroz et al.1 is plotted as a solid
green line in Figure 5; the dashed green lines represent the 5% uncertainty range of this
value. We found a low relative deviation of ∼5% between our
average value and the literature value. This good agreement proves
that correct thermal diffusivity values are obtained even for samples
with low optical absorption coefficients for the exciting wavelength.

We note the fundamental difficulty in quantitatively comparing
the thermal conductivity of polymer samples reported from different
groups. This is an inherent problem owing to the variability of the
sample microstructure, which can be strongly altered on the basis
of the fabrication and processing conditions. This is particularly
true for semicrystalline samples because not only the polymer chain
orientation but also the degree of crystallinity can vary significantly.
Furthermore, a quantitative characterization of the exact polymer
microstructure is difficult to achieve and often not reported along
the measured thermal conductivity values. In addition to the microstructure,
the thermal transport characterization technique may also result in
systematically differing thermal conductivity values. Consequently,
a broad range of typical thermal conductivities are generally accepted
for many polymer materials, which lead to the dashed lines for PMMA
and LDPE in Figure 5.15 We report the influence of both issues
(sample microstructure and measurement method) on the thermal conductivity
value for our samples to provide a more reasonable classification
of the absolute thermal conductivity values that we offer (see Supporting Information for further information).
We, therefore, compare LIT to xenon flash analysis (XFA) for polymer
samples stemming from various preparation conditions. We found for
the amorphous PMMA samples no signs of polymer crystallinity (Figure S8) and a comparable polymer microstructure.
This led to a good agreement between LIT and XFA (which measure the
cross-plane thermal diffusivity) measurements. For the semicrystalline
LDPE samples, we did not observe any influence of the PR dye on the
degree of crystallinity (see Supporting Information). Yet, the orientation of the crystalline domains is strongly anisotropic
and depends on the processing conditions such as hot-pressing and
thermal annealing (Figure S10). The XFA
measurement results in lower cross-plane thermal diffusivities compared
to LIT, which may be caused by the in-plane orientation of the LDPE
crystallites. Thermal annealing further alters the LDPE microstructure,
as can be seen for the thick XFA samples, which leads to a concomitant
increase in thermal diffusivity. Due to the much lower degree of anisotropy
upon hot pressing, the thin samples for LIT are less sensitive to
the thermal annealing step and, consequently, do not change significantly.

Considering these uncertainties, it becomes clear that we obtained
accurate values of thermal diffusivity for uncoated semitransparent
samples using the slopes method. These experimental results validate
our theoretical expectations discussed in the Numerical
Simulations section. Lock-in thermography is, consequently,
a powerful and versatile characterization technique to measure thermal
transport in thin, freestanding films and fibers, independent of their
optical properties.

Conclusion
In this paper, we developed
a two-dimensional heat conduction model
which includes, in addition to heat losses to the surrounding atmosphere,
also semitransparency of the sample to the exciting wavelength, multiple
reflections at the sample surfaces, and the effect of its semitransparency
through the infrared (IR) sensitivity of the IR camera used. On the
basis of this model, we conducted numerical simulations to investigate
separately the effect of semitransparency on the exciting laser light
and on the IR wavelength of the IR camera. We found that the well-known
slope method, which does not consider semitransparency, is still valid
as long as the phase and amplitude slopes are extracted far from the
heating spot center (≳2μ). We translate our theoretical
findings into the measurement of three different polymers, poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polyether
ether ketone (PEEK). The optical properties in the visible and IR
wavelength ranges of these polymers were varied by their film thickness
(PEEK) or by the addition of a red dye (PMMA and LDPE). We obtained
thermal diffusivity values which are in good agreement with literature
values and independent of the optical absorption properties of the
samples. We could, therefore, show that, in the thermally thin regime,
the slopes method holds (far from the heating spot center) independent
of semitransparency (to the exciting wavelength and in the IR range
of the camera). Consequently, the in-plane thermal diffusivity can
be measured accurately.
