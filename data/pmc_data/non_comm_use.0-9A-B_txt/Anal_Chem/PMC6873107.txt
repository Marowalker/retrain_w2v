Capitalizing on the
massive increase in sample concentrations which
are produced by extremely low elution volumes, nanoliquid chromatography–electrospray
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC–ESI-MS/MS) is
currently one of the most sensitive analytical technologies for the
comprehensive characterization of complex protein samples. However,
despite tremendous technological improvements made in the production
and the packing of monodisperse spherical particles for nanoflow high-pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC), current state-of-the-art systems still
suffer from limits in operation at the maximum potential of the technology.
With the recent introduction of the μPAC system, which provides
perfectly ordered micropillar array based chromatographic support
materials, completely new chromatographic concepts for optimization
toward the needs of ultrasensitive proteomics become available. Here
we report on a series of benchmarking experiments comparing the performance
of a commercially available 50 cm micropillar array column to a widely
used nanoflow HPLC column for the proteomics analysis of 10 ng of
tryptic HeLa cell digest. Comparative analysis of LC–MS/MS-data
corroborated that micropillar array cartridges provide outstanding
chromatographic performance, excellent retention time stability, and
increased sensitivity in the analysis of low-input proteomics samples
and thus repeatedly yielded almost twice as many unique peptide and
unique protein group identifications when compared to conventional
nanoflow HPLC columns.

==== Body
The field of proteomics aims
at the qualitative and quantitative description of all proteins contained
in complex biological samples. Currently, the most sensitive proteomics
platforms are almost exclusively based on the combination of two key
analytical methods: nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography
(nano-HPLC) and tandem mass-spectrometry (MS/MS), hyphenated by electrospray
ionization (ESI). However, despite the tremendous improvements in
ultrasensitive nano-HPLC–ESI-MS/MS-based proteomics workflows
and instrumentation, which capitalize on the massive increase in sample
concentrations produced by extremely low elution volumes, the comprehensive
characterization of, e.g., single mammalian cells still challenges
the sensitivity of currently available technologies.

Next to
the development of dedicated low-input sample preparation
methods,1−4 which aim at reducing sample losses prior to analysis, changes to
the chromatographic support material have recently been identified
key to the sensitive profiling of low-input proteomics samples by
nano-HPLC–ESI-MS/MS.5,6

While nonporous
particles have been demonstrated to hold the great
potential of high chromatographic separation power and to further
reduce on-column losses,5 their expedient
integration into standard proteomics nanoflow HPLC systems has long
suffered from their intrinsically low loading capacity.6 However, especially in the context of low-input
proteomics, which aims at analyzing protein amounts in the nanogram
to picogram-range, the capacity of these novel reversed-phase (RP)
HPLC support materials is not a limiting factor. More importantly,
the potential gain in sensitivity due to improved peak width and peak
capacities provided by these new types of chromatographic columns
makes them extremely attractive for ultrasensitive proteomics applications.

With the recent commercialization of perfectly ordered micropillar
array-based nano-HPLC cartridges (μPAC, PharmaFluidics), we
wished to explore potential benefits of this technology to the ultrasensitive
analysis of low-input proteomics samples. Here we report on a series
of benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of a 50 cm micropillar
array nano-HPLC cartridge to a state-of-the-art, particle-based nano-HPLC
column in the analysis of 10 ng of tryptic HeLa cell protein digest.

For these experiments, we installed the respective pre- and analytical
columns (i.e., μPAC RP18, 50 cm, PharmaFluidics; PepMap C18,
3 μm, 75 μm × 50 cm, Thermo) in identical LC–ESI-MS/MS
setups, all comprising an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano LC system (Dionex–Thermo)
operated at 50 °C, coupled to the exact same Q Exactive HF-X
mass-spectrometer (Thermo) using a 360 μm capillary fitting
(C360UFS2, Vici) connected to 12 cm fused silica electrospray emitters
(part number FS3602010N20C12, 360 μm o.d., 20 μm i.d.,
nominal tip i.d. = 10 μm, uncoated). The column outlet of the
PepMap C18 system was connected to the emitter via a 10 cm silica
capillary (20 μm i.d. × 360 μm o.d., Polymicro Technologies),
μPAC cartridges were connected using their preinstalled connection
tubings. One new electrospray emitter was used for all analytical
runs on each column setup. The samples (10 ng/μL HeLa digest,
Pierce; in 0.1% formic acid) were injected using a 1 μL sample-loop
at full loop injection, were trapped on a precolumn, and then separated
by developing two-step linear gradients of increasing length, at a
fixed flow-rate of 250 nL/min: from 2% to 20% acetonitrile in 0.1%
formic acid in 45, 90, and 135 min, followed by 20–32% acetonitrile
in 0.1% formic acid within 15, 30, and 45 min (i.e., 60, 120, or 180
min total gradient time), respectively. All three gradient programs
were completed by a final gradient step from 32 to 78% acetonitrile
in 0.1% formic acid, within 5 min.

The mass-spectrometer was
operated in positive mode and set to
the following acquisition parameters: MS1 resolution = 60 000,
MS1 AGC-target = 1 × 106, MS1 maximum inject time
= 60 ms, MS1 scan range = 350–1500 m/z, MS2 resolution = 15 000, 45 000, or 60 000,
MS2 AGC-target = 2 × 105, maximum inject time = 105
ms, TopN = 10, isolation window = 0.7 m/z, MS2 scan range = “dynamic first mass”, normalized
collision energy = 28, minimum AGC target = 1 × 104, intensity threshold 9.5 × 104, precursor charge
states = 2–6, peptide match = preferred, exclude isotopes =
ON, dynamic exclusion = 45 s, “if idle...” = do not
pick others. All experiments were performed in technical triplicates.

Subsequently, all LC–MS/MS raw-data were processed and identified
using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.3.0.523, Thermo Scientific).
For this, MS/MS spectra were extracted from the raw-files and searched
against the Swissprot protein database, restricting taxonomy to Homo sapiens and including common contaminant protein sequences
(20 341 sequences; 1 1361 548 residues) using
MSAmanda (Engine version v2.0.0.12368).7 The search engine parameters were set as follows: peptide mass tolerance
= ±7 ppm, fragment mass tolerance = 15 ppm, cleavage specificity
= trypsin, missed cleavage sites = 2, fixed modifications = carbamidomethylation
of cysteine, variable modifications = oxidation of methionine. Results
of the MS/MS search engine were filtered to 1% FDR on protein and
peptide level using the Elutator algorithm,8 implemented as a node to Proteome Discoverer 2.3. Identified peptide
features were extracted from the raw-files and quantified, using the
in-house-developed Proteome Discover-node apQuant.9

Comparative analysis of the MS/MS data (Figure 1A,B) highlighted
that μPAC cartridges
repeatedly yielded almost twice as many unique peptide identifications
(e.g., 15 629, at 120 min gradient length) and unique protein
groups (e.g., 2 743, at 120 min gradient length), when compared
to the PepMap C18 system (e.g., 7 364 unique peptides and 1 500
unique protein groups, at a gradient length of 120 min). Of note,
enabling the second search-option available in MS Amanda7 yielded approximately 30% more peptide spectrum
matches and approximately 20% more peptide identifications, irrespective
of the chromatographic system used (data not shown). An overlay of
the identifications showed excellent agreement with respect to a core-set
of peptides (Figure 1C) and protein groups (Figure 1D), which were identified with both nano-HPLC setups. Remarkably,
however, although >90% of all peptide and protein group identified
with the PepMap C18 system were also found in the μPAC setup,
the latter allowed for the additional identification of 80% more peptides
and 90% more protein groups (Figure 1C,D). This important increase in peptide and protein
group identifications specifically provided by the μPAC system,
were primarily due to almost twice as many MS/MS spectra triggered
in the respective experiments (e.g., 26 358 and 14 027,
at 120 min gradient length, for μPAC and PepMap, respectively),
corroborating increased sensitivity. Of note, the maximum TopN number
of 10 precursor ion-masses to be scheduled for MS/MS analysis was
hardly reached in the μPAC experiments (e.g., in 10 duty-cycles,
at 120 min gradient length) and never exceeded more than 6 precursor
ion-masses to be scheduled for MS/MS in the PepMap experiments at
120 min gradient length.

setup. (A) Average number of unique peptide and (B) unique protein
groups identified, at different gradient lengths, across three technical

plots of precursor-ion specific chromatographic peak areas of (E)
peptides identified in both nano-HPLC setups and (F) peptides which
were exclusively identified in either of the two nano-HPLC setups
in at least two technical repeats at a gradient length of 120 min.
All data processing, chromatographic peak detection, and peak area
calculations were performed using Proteome Discoverer 2.3, MS Amanda,
and apQuant.

Further investigating the substantial
μPAC-specific gain
in peptide and protein identifications, we extracted peptide precursor-ion
specific chromatographs and calculated the respective chromatographic
peak areas, using apQuant. Comparison of the data highlighted that
peptide precursor-ion intensities were on average 2-fold higher when
using the μPAC cartridges (Figure 1E). Clearly warranting further investigations,
we speculate that the “core-shell”-type architecture
of the μPAC micropillar arrays (as opposed to the porous bead
structure of the PepMap material) effectively reduces on-column losses
of low-input samples and results in a global increase in peptide precursor-ion
signal. This hypothesis is further corroborated by the observation
that, in contrast to a steady decline in peptide identifications with
increasing gradient length observed for the PepMap column (Figure 1A), sample/signal-dilution
by peak-broadening appeared to be partially compensated for by reduced
on-column losses in μPAC cartridges even at 120 min gradient
length (Figure 1A).
At 180 min gradient length, however, this compensatory effect of the
μPAC system appeared to become exhausted by peak-broadening
and resulted in a decline in peptide/protein identifications also
for the μPAC-cartridge. Similarly, also μPAC-only identifications
(i.e., 8 977 peptides and 1 343 proteins; Figure 1C) predominantly derived from
low-abundance peptide precursor-ions (Figure 1F). The sparse PepMap-only identified peptides,
however, were detected within a precursor-ion intensity range which
was similar to common peptide identifications.

Additionally,
we comparatively analyzed the chemical characters
of peptides uniquely identified by either of the two nano-LC–MS/MS
systems. The data revealed subtle, yet mechanistically insightful,
differences on the separation characteristics of the two chromatographic
systems compared in our study (please see Supplementary Figure 1). Most importantly, this analysis provides clear indications
that the use of μPAC cartridges do indeed allow for a more sensitive
detection, specifically of longer tryptic peptides, when compared
to the pepMap columns (Supplementary Figure 1C). By contrast, uniquely identified peptide sequences, do not show
appreciable differences with respect to pI-value
or GRAVY-index (please see Supplementary Figure 1B,C). Similarly, GO-term enrichment analysis of uniquely identified
proteins on either system did not provide substantial insight into
the chromatographic merit of either system (data not shown).

Next, we analyzed chromatographic performance parameters of the
two systems. For this, we automatically extracted peptide-specific
retention times at the peak apex, determined full-width at half-maximum
(fwhm), and calculated peak asymmetry parameters (i.e., skewness),
using apQuant. The comparison of peptide-specific peak widths (i.e.,
fwhm) revealed broader peaks on the PepMap columns (i.e., mean = 12.9
and 10.2 s, for a 120 min gradient on PepMap and μPAC, respectively; Figure 2A) and suggested
a 25% increase in peak capacity for the μPAC system (i.e., estimated
peak capacity of 560 and 705, at 120 min gradient length, for PepMap
and μPAC, respectively). More importantly, however, while 90%
of all peptides identified with μPAC cartridges had a fwhm of
<12 s, the same proportion of peptides were detected with a fwhm
of <16 s on the PepMap C18 system (Figure 2B). Additionally, while both nano-LC setups
performed similarly at the 60 min gradient length (Figure 2C), the μPAC system provided
superior peak-width at extended gradient times (i.e., 180 min; Figure 2D). Chromatographic
peak symmetry, as determined by calculating peptide-specific peak
skewness, was found similar in both setups (Figure 2E).

μPAC RP18 and
the PepMap C18 nano-HPLC systems. (A) Relative comparison of the density
distribution of peptide-specific peak widths (fwhm). (B) Cumulative
plot of peptide specific fwhm at 120 min, (C) 60 min, and (D) 180
min. For all plots, fwhm bin width = 1 s. (E) Comparison of chromatographic
peak asymmetry at 120 min gradient length, as calculated by “skewness”
(bin width = 0.2). All chromatographic peak detection and feature
calculations were performed using apQuant for Proteome Discoverer
2.3.

Most interestingly, however, close
investigation of the LC–MS/MS
data generated in the course of this study revealed an unprecedented
degree of retention-time stability of μPAC cartridges (Figure 3). For this, we calculated
the deviation from the mean retention time of the identified peptide
features across three technical replicates. While 95% of all features
identified on the PepMap system were found to elute within a retention
time window of approximately 44 s, at 120 min gradient length, the
same proportion of features identified on the μPAC setup eluted
within in a time window of approximately 4 s at 120 min gradient length
and did not exceed 10 s at 180 min gradient length. This outstanding
retention-time stability and precision of μPAC cartridges clearly
warrants future applications of this ultrasensitive nano-HPLC setup
in time-dependent LC–MS and LC–MS/MS data-acquisition
regimes (e.g., scheduled tSIM or PRM workflows). Of note, when compared
to packed-bead columns, micropillar arrays still suffer from an inherently
reduced maximum loading capacity (i.e., vendor recommendations suggest
not to exceed a sample load of 1 μg of tryptic HeLa digest for
a 50 cm μPAC cartridge) which might in some cases preclude their
application in, e.g., clinical high-input proteomics workflows.

Figure 3 Comparison
of retention time stability and precision.

Taken together, our results highlight impressive improvements in
performance in the analysis of low-input proteomics samples by the
application of μPAC RP18 cartridges over current state-of-the-art
nano-HPLC systems. Not only did we yield almost twice as many unique
peptide and unique protein group identifications, when compared to
conventional nanoflow HPLC columns, but we also observed unprecedented
retention-time stability on the micropillar array-based nano-HPLC
μPAC cartridges.

Owing to the flexibility in design and
the great potential to even
further optimize chromatographic support materials and formats, this
first commercial implementation of the μPAC concept clearly
provides very attractive new strategies for increased sensitivity
in nano-HPLC–ESI-MS/MS based proteomics platforms toward the
ultrasensitive analysis of single mammalian cells.
