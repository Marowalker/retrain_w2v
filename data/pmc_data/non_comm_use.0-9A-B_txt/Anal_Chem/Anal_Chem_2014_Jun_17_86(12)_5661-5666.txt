The glycosylation in recombinant
monoclonal antibody (rMab) drugs
is a major concern in the biopharmaceutical industry as it impacts
the drugs’ many attributes. Characterization is important but
complicated by the intricate structures, microheterogeneity, and the
limitations of current tools for structural analysis. In this study,
we developed a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
N-glycan library based on eight commercial rMab drugs. A library of
over 70 structures was developed for the rapid characterization of
rMab. N-Glycans were separated on a porous graphitized carbon (PGC)
column incorporated on a chip and then analyzed by an electrospray
ionization hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) MS. The retention
time and accurate mass for each N-glycan were recorded in the library.
The complete structures were obtained through exoglycosidase sequencing.
The results showed that most of the N-glycans between different antibodies
are nearly the same with different abundances. The utility of this
library enables one to identify structures in a rapid manner by matching
LC retention times and accurate masses.

==== Body
Recombinant
monoclonal antibody
(rMab) drugs have emerged as a powerful class of biopharmaceuticals.
Their specificity toward target antigens makes them effective treatments
for cancers and other chronic diseases.1−4 rMab-based drugs have multiple functions
including blocking the signal transduction of tumor cells to proliferate,
activating the immune system to kill tumor cells, and carrying cancer
drugs or radiation targets to tumor cells.3 The first licensed rMab drug was muromonab in 1986, and it is estimated
that approximately 30% of the new drugs approved in the next decade
will be rMab drugs.1,3,5−8 Currently, there are more than 30 approved rMab drugs and hundreds
of new rMab drug candidates under clinical trials.5 All currently approved rMab drugs are based on IgG and
are usually manufactured from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), mouse myeloma
NS0, and mouse myeloma Sp2/0 cell lines.1,3,5−10

rMab is composed of two identical light chains and two identical
heavy chains. The antibody contains three domains: the antigen binding
(Fab), the hinge region, and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain.9,10 There is one N-glycosylation site (Asn 297) found in the Fc region
on both identical heavy chains. Some rMabs may contain oligosaccharides
in the Fab region.11,12 Although the oligosaccharides
in the Fc region only account for 2–3% of the total protein
mass, they have a major affect in functions related to drug efficacy,
pharmacokinetics, stability, and immunogenicity.10,13−15 For example, the effector function of the deglycosylated
or aglycosylated rMab is found to be severely compromised or ablated,15 while an increased level of N-glycolylneuraminic
acid (NeuGc) produces shorter half-life.16 In general, specific glycoforms can increase or decrease the drug
efficacy, although the precise reason may not always be clearly understood.14,15,17 Therefore, deep structural characterization
of N-glycosylation of rMab is essential for drug development and production.
However, the microheterogeneity of the glycans, their diverse compositions,
the large number of isomeric structures, and the large variations
in abundances all make extensive glycan characterization of rMab a
slow and tedious process.18,19 Furthermore, because
the best known pharmaceuticals were discovered much earlier when glycoanalytics
was not as advanced, the threshold for characterization was much lower.
Glycan analysis was focused on three components known as G0F, G1F,
and G2F.20,21 However, the coming tide of biosimilars
and follow-on biologics will require considerably better glycan characterization.

In this report, we describe a method for the rapid characterization
of rMab glycosylation using a detailed N-glycan library exclusively
for rMab. The library was constructed using commercial rMab drugs
including trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab, cetuximab, panitumumab,
infliximab, ofatumumab, and eculizumab. NanoLC-Chip-Q-TOF analysis,
exoglycosidase sequencing, and a reference N-glycan library built
from human serum glycoproteins were used to build the rMab N-glycan
library.22,23 All the N-glycans were separated on the
nanoLC-chip with a PGC column. Owing to the excellent separation performance
of the PGC medium and the high mass accuracy of TOF MS, each N-glycan
isomer has a unique retention time and accurate mass.24−27 The reproducible retention time and accurate mass are used to rapidly
identify unknown glycans in the rMab.25,28−30

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Reagents
All the rMab
drugs were obtained
from UC Davis Medical Center. Peptide, N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F),
and exoglycosidases, α(2-3)neuraminidase (sialidase), α(1-2,3)mannosidase,
and β-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (β-GlcNAcase), were obtained
from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA); β(1-4)Galactosidase
and α(1-3,4)fucosidase were obtained from Prozyme (Hayward,
CA). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).
Sodium borohydride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
All reagents are of analytical or HPLC grade.

N-Glycan Release, Reduction,
and Purification
N-glycans
were released from rMab using standard PNGase F methods.31 Briefly, rMab drugs were first denatured by
DTT and then treated with PNGase F to release N-glycans. Free N-glycans
were then purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) using graphitized
carbon cartridges (GCC) (Alltech Associated, Deerfield, IL) in an
automated manner using a Gilson GX-274 ASPEC robot liquid handler.
Purified N-glycans were reduced by 1 M NaBH4 in a water
bath at 65 °C for 2 h. Reduced N-glycans were desalted and enriched
again with GCC-SPE to remove salts from the reduction.

N-Glycan Preparation
For simplicity, the compounds
were first separated as much as possible using HPLC on a Hypercarb
PGC column (Thermo Scientific) (100 mm × 0.5 mm i.d., 5 μm
particle size) with a Hewlett-Packard series 1100 HPLC system. Fractions
were collected in 1 min intervals. A binary solvent system was used
comprising of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in 3% ACN in water (v/v) as solvent
A and 0.1% FA in 90% ACN in water (v/v) as solvent B. N-Glycans were
separated by the gradient: 0–25 min, 0%–15% B; 25.01–50
min, 15–40% B; 50–70 min, 40–100% B at a flow
rate of 0.30 mL/min. Fractions were collected in a 70 min run, dried,
and reconstituted with nanopure water.

nanoLC-Chip-Q-TOF MS of
N-Glycan
Each fraction was
monitored for N-glycan content using an Agilent 6520 nanoLC-Chip-Q-TOF
equipped with an Agilent 1200 series nano-LC system. The nano-LC system
employs a binary solvent system consisting of solvent A, 0.1% formic
acid (FA) in 3% ACN in water (v/v), and solvent B, 0.1% FA in 90%
ACN in water (v/v). The enrichment column (40 nL PGC) and analytical
column (75 μm × 43 mm, 5 μm particle size, PGC) are
integrated on a chip, which is placed in the chip–cube interface.
The N-glycans were concentrated on the enrichment column for 5 min
with 100% solvent A. The instrument was then switched to analysis
mode, thereby delivering the N-glycans from the enrichment column
to the analytical column for separation. The gradient used was 0%
B, 0–2.5 min; 0–16% B, 2.5–20 min; 16–44%
B, 20–30 min; 44–100% B, 30–35 min; and 100%
B, 35–45 min followed by pure A for 20 min as an equilibration.
All MS spectra were acquired in positive mode. The instrument was
calibrated prior to use to yield mass accuracies below 5 ppm for MS
and 20 ppm for MS/MS.

Tandem MS and Exoglycosidase Digestion
Tandem MS analysis
was used to guide the exoglycosidase digestions, which in turn were
used to elucidate the complete structures. Tandem MS spectra were
acquired through collision induced dissociation (CID) by nanoLC-Chip-Q-TOF
in the auto MS/MS mode. The applied collision energy depends on the m/z of each compound according to the formula:  where the slope and intercept were optimized
to obtain maximum fragment information.28

Buffers for the reaction were prepared by adding glacial acetic
acid to 0.1 M ammonium acetate to achieve the desired pH for each
enzyme. Reaction time varied from 1 to 24 h at 37 °C depending
on the specificity of the enzyme. Reaction conditions for each enzyme
are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S2). It is important to point out that the enzyme specificity
varied with reaction times. The optimal times were determined in previous
studies.32 The enzymes included α(2-3)neuraminidase
(sialidase), α(1-2,3)mannosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase
(GlcNAcase), β(1-4)galactosidase, and α(1-3,4)fucosidase.

Results and Discussion
Structural Identification of rMab N-Glycans
Using a Human Serum
Glycoprotein N-Glycan Library
In a previous study, we published
N-glycan structures from a group of the most abundant glycoproteins
in serum.22 Those glycan structures were
used to identify some of the structures in the antibodies. The N-glycan
library is developed based on released and reduced N-glycans from
serum glycoproteins, separated on a PGC column, and analyzed by TOF
MS. The linkages were elucidated through a combination of exoglycosidase
sequencing, LC, LC–MS, and tandem MS. The comprehensive N-glycan
library is composed of complete structures with associated LC retention
times, accurate masses, and relative abundances. The mass accuracy
of Q-TOF MS used in this study is 5 ppm and the retention time coefficient
variance (CV) of the nano-Chip-LC is within 0.6% when run on the same
day, which assured the robustness of this approach. The majority of
the N-glycans from the eight commercial rMab drugs were characterized
by matching the LC retention times and accurate masses with the structures
in a previously annotated reference library.22

Figure 1 illustrates how the structures
were assigned for rMab via LC retention time and accurate mass. Reference
compounds in the library are obtained from serum glycoproteins. Shown
in Figure 1 are extracted compound chromatograms
(ECC) of several compounds from the reference library and from the
antibody drug. In Figure 1a, the upper chromatogram
shows the four isomers of N54110 in the reference compound. The nomenclature
uses the letter “N” for N-glycan with each digit representing
the composition Hex:HexNac:Fuc:NeuAc:NeuGc. The mass spectrometer
does not distinguish between mannose and galactose (Hex) or between
N-acetylgalactose and N-acetylglucose amine (HexNAc). However, fucose
(Fuc) as well as N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) and N-glycolylneuraminic
acid (NeuGc) are readily determined by mass. NeuGc is not typically
found in humans but is found in other mammals.33 The abundances of NeuGc residues in rMab are low but measurable
and are due to the production in CHO/SP 20/NS0 cells.21 The lower case letters following the numbers represent
the order in which the compound was elucidated and roughly follows
its relative abundance in serum or its relative abundance in rMab
for those not present in serum. The lower chromatogram in Figure 1a shows the ECC of one isomer of N54110 found in
Trastuzumab that is aligned with a structure originally found in serum
glycoproteins and whose structure is known. Therefore, the compound
in rMab is identified as the same structure N54110a in the N-glycan
library. The symbolic structure is shown in the inset. Figure 1b demonstrates the identification of N44100a and
N44100b in rMab. The complete structures for N44100a and N44100b are
given with the isomer “a” having a Gal on the 1-6 arm
and isomer “b” with the terminal Gal on the 1-3 arm
(structure inset). N44000a and N44000b in Figure 1c and N55110a in Figure 1d were identified
in the same way.

Figure 1 Illustration of the identification procedure for antibody
N-glycans
using a previously annotated reference library. (a) Extracted compound
chromatogram (ECC) of composition N54110 from an N-glycan reference
library and from the rMab. Four isomers were found in the reference
library for the monofucosylated monosialylated structure. On the basis
of the similarities in accurate mass and retention times, the structure
was determined as shown (inset). (b) Two isomers with similar retention
times corresponding to monofucosylated biantennary structures. The
rMab glycans matched those corresponding to the library and the structures
were determined (inset). (c) Two isomers corresponding to terminal
monogalactosylated structures. The structures were determined and
are shown (inset). (d) A bisecting GlcNAc with monosialylated and
monofucosylated structure as determined by comparison to the reference
library. Compounds were reduced to the alditol prior to the LC–MS
analysis. Symbolic N-glycan structures correspond to (blue ■)
N-acetylglucosamine, (green ●) mannose, (yellow ●) galactose,
(○) hexose, (red ▲) fucose, (purple ◆) N-acetyl
neuraminic acid, (◊) N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Linkages are
provided at the glycosidic bond.

In order to further evaluate the robustness of using LC retention
times to identify isomers from the N-glycan library, the retention
time shift between different runs within 1 day of rMab N-glycans was
examined. The retention time repeatability was high with the largest
shift in retention time correspond to approximately 0.1 min in a 60
min gradient (Figure 2); however, the shifts
are generally much less. This corresponding CV was calculated to be
∼0.6%.

Figure 2 Chromatograms of 13 overlaid injections showing the major
N-glycans
from Panitumumab acquired on nanoLC-Chip-TOF. Injections were performed
consecutively. The largest variation in retention time corresponded
to 0.10 min.

Structural Elucidation
Using Exoglycosidase Sequencing
Additional exoglycosidase
sequencing was performed to deduce the
complete structures of around 30 percent of N-glycans in rMab that
were not determined based on the current N-glycan library because
they are either absent or in very low abundance. The enzymes are sufficiently
specific to linkages for specific digestion periods as previously
reported in our laboratory.29,32 In order to eliminate
the interference resulting from isomeric structures during the digestion,
off-line HPLC fractionation was performed to isolate the compounds
as much as possible. Fractionating the compounds also minimized overlap
between enzymatic digestion products. Figure 3 demonstrates the determination of two isomers of N33100 obtained
in two separate fractions, using α(1-2,3)mannosidase. The upper
chromatograms in Figure 3a,b show the two isomers
before enzyme digestion (MS spectra are the inset). The lower chromatograms
show two digestion products with two distinct masses (MS spectra are
the inset). After 24 h of α(1-2,3)mannosidase digestion, the
isomer in Figure 3a lost one mannose while
the isomer in Figure 3b remained the same mass
thereby showing that the first has the terminal mannose on the 1-6
arm while the second has the terminal mannose on the 1-3 arm. The
same method employing enzyme digestion monitored by LC–MS were
applied to deduce the other structures in rMabs. The retention times
of all the new N-glycans were noted and used for future structural
identification in other rMabs.

Figure 3 Chromatograms (with MS inset) produced
during exoglycosidase sequencing
of two isomers with composition N33100 (1261.50 Da, neutral mass).
(a) The upper chromatogram shows isomer N33100a before digestion.
The representation identifies the uncertainty in the structure. The
lower panel includes the ECC of the neutral mass 1261.50 and 1099.45
Da. A single mannose was lost after 24-h digestion with α(1-2,3)mannosidase
(MS inset) suggesting an uncapped mannose structure on the 1-3 antenna.
The results show that the terminal GlcNAc is on the 1-6 branch. (b)
The upper chromatogram shows isomer N3310b before enzyme digestion
(MS inset). This compound was analyzed at the same time as the other
isomer. There was no loss in signal or new smaller homologue produced
when the compound was reacted with α(1-2,3) mannosidase.

N-Glycan Library for rMab
The completed N-glycan library
for rMab includes all the N-glycans from the commercial rMab drugs
detected by nanoLC–Q-TOF MS. Relative abundances were acquired
for each N-glycan based on the integration of the ion abundances associated
with each peak and normalized to the total ion counts of all the N-glycans
of each rMab. The rMab N-glycan library contains more than 70 entries
spanning 3 orders of magnitude in abundances. There are 25 fully elucidated
structures, with the remainder being partially elucidated structures.
The latter group is of low abundances and could not be isolated in
sufficient amounts for complete elucidation. The fraction of fully
elucidated structures represents more than 80–90% of the total
abundances for each rMab. This group represents a significantly more
comprehensive one than the standard G0F, G1F, and G2F.11,12,20,34−36 N-Glycans with NeuGc residues were also included
in the library, and however their abundances were usually less than
5% of the most abundant species.

Table S1 in the Supporting Information presents the comprehensive
library, with systematic names, accurate masses, symbolic structures
annotated with linkage information, and associated rMab drugs. The
top 10 N-glycans were found in all rMab drugs included in this study.
Most isomers were well separated and characterized. The most abundant
compounds generally contained complete structures and are shown with
all linkage information. The common structures referred to as G1F,
G0F-GlcNAc, G1 correspond to the respective pairs N44100a and N44100b,
N33100a and N33100b, and N44000a and N44000b.11,12,20,21,35−37 The extracted chromatograms provide
relative quantitative information. For example, the two isomers, N44100a
and N44100b have significantly different abundances with N44100a (Gal
on the 1-6 antenna) almost twice as abundant as N44100b (Gal on the
1-3 antenna) in Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab, Rituximab, Cetuximab, Infliximab,
Ofatumumab, and Eculizumab. In contrast, N44100b is twice as abundant
as N44100a in Panitumumab (Figure 4). The most
abundant N-glycans generally corresponded to G2F, G1F, G2F, and Man5
as stated in previous reports.12,20,21,34−38 However, we find that other N-glycans may be as abundant
(Table 1). For example, N74100a is even more
abundant than N44100b (G1bF) and N54100a (G2F) in Cetuximab. Similar
observations are found with Infliximab, Ofatumumab, and Panitumumab,
where noncommon structures were more abundant than those commonly
monitored. Cetuximab and Infliximab (produced in Sp2/0 cell lines)
and Ofatumumab (produced in NS0 cell lines) are found to have a higher
percent of NeuGc-containing N-glycans (6.81%, 6.51%, and 5.16%, respectively)
compared to Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab, Rituximab, and Panitumumab (0%,
4.15%, 3.67%, and 0%, respectively), which are produced in CHO cell
lines. This finding is consistent with a previous report that CHO
cell lines may yield lower abundances of NeuGc-containing N-glycans.16

Conclusion
We
constructed an N-glycan library containing complete structures
for rapid and high-throughput glycan analysis of rMab. This library
provides a reference for the rapid identification of glycans in rMab
and possibly other biologics that are produced with the same cell
lines. The reproducible LC retention times and accurate masses are
useful markers for identifying structures. It no longer requires further
time-consuming N-glycan isolation and extensive exoglycosidase sequencing.22,29,39 The tandem mass spectra for each
N-glycan were also recorded in the library but were seldom used for
further identification (Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information). For the utility of the N-glycan Library, a 0.1
min retention time window and 20 ppm mass accuracy window are suggested
as the minimum criteria for identification.22,29,39
