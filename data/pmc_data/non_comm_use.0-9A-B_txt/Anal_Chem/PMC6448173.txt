The
open-access scientific literature contains a wealth of information
for meaningful text mining. However, this information is not always
easy to retrieve. This technical note addresses the problem by a new
flexible method combining in a single workflow existing resources
for literature searches, text mining, and large-scale prediction of
physicochemical and biological properties. The results are visualized
as virtual mass spectra, chromatograms, or images in styles new to
text mining but familiar to analytical chemistry. The method is demonstrated
on comparisons of analytical-chemistry techniques and semantically
enriched searches for proteins and their activities, but it may also
be of general utility in experimental design, drug discovery, chemical
syntheses, business intelligence, and historical studies. The method
is realized in shareable scientific workflows using only freely available
data, services, and software that scale to millions of publications
and named chemical entities in the literature.

==== Body
The scientific
literature provides
an abundance of information in the public domain for text mining and
machine learning, including PubMed with 29.1 million titles and abstracts
and Europe PMC1 with 2.25 million full-text
articles that are open access or have CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, or CC0 licenses.
Millions of named entities such as diseases, genes, proteins, and
metabolites are already text-mined and annotated in the SciLite2 platform. These annotations can be accessed programmatically
from Europe PMC via the recently introduced Annotations API, which
is similar to the web services used to access bibliographic information.1 These services can be combined and the searches
orchestrated in scientific workflow systems such as Taverna3−6 or KNIME,7 which also ensures reproducibility
and enables open sharing of literature analyses.

Metabolites,
drugs, and other small molecules are annotated using
the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology8 containing 99 413 entities (release 169),
along with synonyms, CAS registry numbers, elemental formulas, masses,
and chemical structures in SMILES9 and
InChI10 formats. These structures are used
to derive a number of molecular descriptors. From these descriptors
and available experimental data, machine learning is used to predict
important physicochemical and biological properties, such as aqueous
solubility,11−13 melting point,11,14 vapor pressure,15,16 bioavailability,17,18 developmental toxicity,19,20 and receptor binding.21

This note
describes how text mining for chemical entities can be
combined with prediction of their physicochemical properties to guide
the selection of analytical methods, extract information on proteins
and their ligands, or study the history of a particular subfield of
chemistry in semantically enriched literature searches.

Experimental
Section
The method presented here is a combination of three
web-based services
made interoperable through scripts embedded in a workflow executed
on the user’s side. The starting point is one or a set of literature
queries. Each query is used to generate one API call to the Europe
PMC searchPublications RESTful service. The searches can be restricted
to previously tagged22 sections, such as
the methods sections, or unrestricted. Each call returns a list of
PubMed identifiers with metadata such as whether annotations from
text mining are available. The annotated chemical compounds and classes
in publications for which text mining results are available are retrieved
using the recently launched getAnnotations service (Figure 1). After these searches, molecular
information such as mass, elemental composition, and structures (as
SMILES or InChIs) can be looked up in the ontology from the returned
molecular (ChEBI) identifiers. The returned SMILES can then be used
to predict a number of physicochemical and biological properties on
a computational chemistry server such as OCHEM.23 Polarities were predicted using ALogPS 3.0 on OCHEM as
the 1-octanol–water-partition coefficient (log P). Estrogen-receptor and p53-signaling agonists were predicted using
the qualitative consensus estrogen-receptor-α- and p53-signaling-agonists
OCHEM models21 (model IDs 518 and 522,
respectively) developed to answer the Tox21 challenge.24 The 4216 ChEBI compounds that had already been
used to train the models for ER and p53-signaling agonists were removed
from further analysis. The ChEBI ontology includes 5104 chemical classes
with wildcards in their SMILES, individual elements, isotopes, and
even elementary particles. As physicochemical properties cannot be
meaningfully measured or predicted for such, these ChEBI entities
were also excluded, even though they are annotated in many publications.
To accelerate the workflow, these properties were precomputed for
the 99 413 entities in ChEBI and stored locally in a lookup
table. The ChEBI ontology is updated monthly, whereas Europe PMC results
can change on a daily basis with new publications and text-mined items.
The molecular masses were extracted from the ChEBI OBO file and added
to the lookup table.

Figure 1 Schematic of analysis. In principle, all analysis in this
note
can be done by connecting three web services or applications: searchPublications
and getAnnotations from Europe PMC and the OCHEM ALogPS prediction
model. The service calls can be orchestrated by a single scientific
workflow in workflow managers such as Taverna or KNIME.

To compare multiple queries, the results were normalized
against
the total number of annotations for each comparand. Visualizations
were generated in R. For density plots, a 2D Gaussian blur was applied
with standard deviations 0.125 log P units (two bins)
and 6.25 Da (one bin) to represent the inherent uncertainties in log P predictions as well as the difference between calculated
monoisotopic masses and measured masses due to the presence of isotopes,
charge carriers, adducts, or neutral losses. The custom computer code
used in this work is embedded in a KNIME workflow available on GitHub
(https://github.com/magnuspalmblad/EuropePMC2ChEBI). The R functions used to visualize the results are also included
in the repository.

To demonstrate the methodology, Europe PMC
was queried for “electrospray
ionization” (ESI), “atmospheric pressure chemical ionization”
(APCI), “electron impact”, “and gas chromatography”
(GC). Furthermore, tagged methods sections were searched for “liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry” (LC-MS). Europe PMC
was also searched for annotations of the estrogen receptor (UniProt P03372) and the
cellular tumor antigen p53 (UniProt P04637).

Results
The results
from a single literature search can be visualized as
a distribution of one or more derived properties of the chemical compounds
retrieved from the text-mined publications. Figure 2 illustrates this as a familiar “mass
spectrum” for all compounds annotated in publications mentioning
LC-MS in their methods sections but with annotations retrieved from
all sections. In general, any property that can be both measured and
predicted can be stored, visualized, and analyzed similarly, as a
chromatogram, image, or mass spectrum.

Figure 2 Distribution of integer
masses of ChEBI compounds in publications
with “liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry”
in their methods sections visualized as an integer mass spectrum.
The truncated base peak at mass 18 (18 491 occurrences) is
dominated by ammonium ions and water. The second most abundant mass
at 180 (14 497 occurrences) represents the hexoses. This simple
analysis makes no distinctions among solvent, reagents, analytes,
adducts, and neutral losses. However, analytes dominate at larger
masses, and there are even discernible peaks for the anticancer drugs
paclitaxel and docetaxel at 853 and 861 and the antibiotics sirolimus,
colistin, cyclosporin A, and vancomycin at masses 913, 1150, 1201,
and 1448, respectively. This is an actual mass spectrum, with mass
rather than mass-to-charge ratio on the abscissa.

It is tempting to generalize the picture by traversing the
ontology,
looking at general classes rather than discrete chemical entities.
However, two chemical entities in the same class (for example, methanol
and octadecan-1-ol, both being primary alcohols) may have very different
physicochemical properties. An alternative way to generalize the chemical
entities associated with a particular method or process is to predict
the most relevant properties of these entities using quantitative
structure–property relationships (QSPR). When looking at multiple
properties, the distributions can be visualized as heatmaps or images. Figure 3 shows the results
from ALogPS 3.0 1-octanol–water-partition-coefficient (log P) QSPR predictions for all chemically distinct ChEBI entities,
highlighting two classes with very different physicochemical properties.

Figure 3 Prediction
of 1-octanol–water-partition coefficients and
masses for 90 056 ChEBI compounds. The instances of some ChEBI
classes are clustered in the mass–log P space
(e.g., the amino trisaccharides, CHEBI: 59266, magenta), whereas others,
such as the alkanes (CHEBI:
18310, cyan), chart a predictable course through this mass–log P space. Although the ontological hierarchy provides a solid
framework for systematically aggregating data on related compounds
in a given context, it is important to remember the chemical diversity
within an ontological class limits the representativeness of averages
collated by traversing the ontology for all instances of this class
in the literature on a particular topic. The crosses indicate the
averages (or centers of mass) of the amino trisaccharides and alkanes
in this map.

Phase diagrams of applicability
of analytical methods as functions
of analyte mass and polarity are common in the literature,25 including in textbooks, where they are used
to compare methods of chromatographic separations or ionization in
mass spectrometry. These diagrams are drawn from subjective experience
rather than an objective metric. With the annotations in Europe PMC,
it is now feasible to look at a large body of the scientific literature
and find actual correlations between analytical methods
and analytes. Three common ionization methods for mass spectrometry
were compared in a tripartite search for ESI, APCI, and electron impact
(now called electron ionization), which retrieved 1 238 516,
116 868, and 267 712 ChEBI annotations from 36 844,
2567, and 5930 papers, respectively. The relative distributions are
displayed in Figure 4. Electron impact (blue) follows the same distribution in polarity
and mass as is observed for gas chromatography. This is unsurprising,
as GC is most commonly interfaced to MS using this ionization method.
Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization has a distinct “sweet
spot” at masses between 500 and 600 Da and 1-octanol–water-partition
coefficients between 106.5 and 108.5. Electrospray
dominates elsewhere in the mass–polarity space. The true phase
diagram of ionization-method applicability is different from the rectangular
diagrams found in the textbooks. However, it is important to consider
that application depends on more than applicability, such as popularity
and availability of particular instrumentation in the laboratories
where published work is carried out. For example, LC-ESI-MS instrumentation
is ubiquitous and versatile and provides appropriate choices of columns
and mobile phases, which may explain why this combination has been
so broadly applied to different types of analytes. Peptides and proteins
are outside ChEBI’s domain. As ChEBI contains fewer than 2000
peptides, and very few proteins, peptidomics, and proteomics data
would not be efficiently captured even if the peptides were explicitly
listed in the papers.

Figure 4 Normalized RGB plot31 of the
application
of atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization–ionization (red),
electrospray ionization–ionization (green), and electron impact
(blue) from 1 623 096 named-entity recognitions in the
scientific literature. Electron impact (now electron ionization) dominates
for small compounds at the upper limit of log P,
whereas APCI is the most popular ionization method for analytes near
500–600 Da and log P values of 6.5–8.5.
A gray or white color indicates no preference among the three ionization
methods, but this is only observed for ubiquitous solvents such as
water.

In addition to physicochemical
properties and properties important
in drug discovery, specific biological functions or interactions can
be predicted by similar machine-learning techniques. From 78 630
predictions, 11 203 ChEBI compounds were predicted to be active
estrogen-receptor (ER) agonists (numeric prediction <0.5; 0.323
± 0.132, where 0 represents active, and 1 represents inactive)
and 67 427 were predicted to be inactive (>0.5, 0.749 ±
0.111) with an 87.4% reported accuracy. A p53-signaling model predicted
28 718 out of 78 309 returned ChEBI compounds to be
active (0.337 ± 0.114) and the remaining 49 591 to be
inactive (0.722 ± 0.134) with 79.5% accuracy. The training of
these predictors was performed using drugs and druglike compounds,
whereas ChEBI contains many compounds that are neither. The results
should therefore not be seen as reflecting poorly on any of the models,
but as a useful way to indicate correlations between a particular
topic or search term (e.g., an enzyme or receptor) and the small molecules
coappearing in the literature with that enzyme or receptor.

The predicted most likely estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, not
counting compounds used to train the model, were norgestrel (CHEBI:
7630), 17-ethynyl-13-methyl-7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16-octahydro-6H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-3,17-diol (CHEBI:
125402), (13S,17R)-17-ethynyl-13-methyl-7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16-octahydro-6H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-3,17-diol (CHEBI:
91483), 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-one
(CHEBI: 92312), (8R,9S,13S,14R,17R)-17-ethynyl-13-methyl-7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16-octahydro-6H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-3,17-diol (CHEBI:
94792), and resveratrol (CHEBI: 27881). Several of these belong to
the estrogen (CHEBI: 50114) class or are known ER agonists (resveratrol26), although (levo)norgestrel has relatively low
affinity for the receptor.27 The most likely
p53-signaling agonists (excluding those in the training set) included
more surprises, with C60 fullerene (CHEBI: 33128), quinacrine
mustard (CHEBI: 37595), acridine half-mustard (CHEBI: 132980), pallidol
(CHEBI: 27881), 2,2′,3′,4,4′,5,5′-heptachloro-3-biphenylol
(CHEBI: 79726), 2,2′,3,3′,4′,5,5′-heptachloro-4-biphenylol
(CHEBI: 34194), and 6-[[(6-methyl-9-indolo[3,2-b]quinoxalinyl)amino]methylidene]-1-cyclohexa-2,4-dienone
(CHEBI: 94089) predicted to be the most likely active agonists, whereas
known p53-signaling agonists in ChEBI (but not in the training set)
such as piplartine–piperlongumine (CHEBI: 8241), 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one
(CHEBI: 94995), and the tripeptide acetylleucyl–leucyl–norleucinal
(CHEBI: 2423) either failed prediction or were predicted to be inactive.
These simple observations already suggest the ER predictions may be
more accurate or at least more specific in the ChEBI domain than the
p53-signaling predictions, despite the latter having a higher reported
prediction accuracy. More relevantly, the 10 predicted most likely
agonists returned by the Europe PMC literature searches for the estrogen
receptor and cellular tumor antigen p53 are shown in Table 1. The list for the former included
the estrogens (CHEBI: 50114) 17β-estradiol, estradiol, and estrone,
as well as the xenoestrogen (CHEBI: 76988) dienestrol and the androgen
(CHEBI: 50113) testosterone; the list for the latter included the
antineoplastic agents (CHEBI: 35610) torin 1, nocodazole, and irinotecan
but also the fluorochromes (CHEBI: 51217) methylene blue, pibenzimol,
ethidium, thionine, and 2′-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2,5′-bibenzimidazole
(a pibenzimol derivative). Although these fluorochromes all bind to
DNA, and several have been investigated for use in photodynamic anticancer
therapy,28,29 they are most often used for staining, also
in the context of p53-signaling studies. Nevertheless, these results
clearly demonstrate the feasibility of semantically enhanced literature
searches combining named-entity recognition of proteins and their
ligands from a small-molecule ontology with large-scale QSPR predictions.

Discussion
The inspiration for the method described here was to demonstrate
the power of combining existing resources and web services for novel
purposes. The number of ways in which literature databases, ontologies,
text-mined annotations, and QSPR modeling can complement each other
is inexhaustible. Multiple ontologies can be combined, such as protein
entities in UniProt (enzymes and receptors), small molecules in ChEBI
(as demonstrated here), and also chemical-method ontologies like CHMO.30 Entities from any of the supported ontologies
can be used in the initial search query in Europe PMC. Much of the
chemistry data and software is proprietary, and the free software
and services that exist typically only support single queries or a
small number of queries. Here, gratis data, software, and services
that are scalable to millions of queries or predictions were used
exclusively, meaning anyone with an Internet connection can repeat
or modify the analyses using the workflow provided in the GitHub repository.

In these demonstrations, no distinction was made between proper
analytes and reagents used in the analysis. Automatically tagging
these requires AI-hard natural-language understanding. The shortcut
can be defended by the safe assumption that for almost any analytical
method or literature search, the number of reported analytes will
be much larger than the number of different additives and derivatizing
agents used in the method. Comparing techniques for analysis or synthesis
using text mining and molecular-property calculations not only summarizes
what has been done but inspire selection of existing methods or development
of new methods that are fit-for-purpose. The examples here were primarily
chosen as positive controls, to check that the resulting visualizations
are reasonable and informative.

In principle, all analyses here
could just as easily be performed
on a larger set of compounds, provided these would be annotated in
the literature. Annotating PubMed with PubChem, containing 97 million
compounds as of March 2019, is an obvious next step. Some differences
are expected, as the coverage of PubChem and ChEBI differ (by design).
Compared with PubChem, ChEBI is heavily influenced by endogenous metabolites
and other large, water-soluble molecules, resulting in the average
ChEBI compound being significantly larger (∼440 vs ∼370
Da) and more polar (log P ∼2.27 vs ∼2.89)
than the average of the 97 million PubChem compounds calculated using
the ALogPS 3.0 model. None of these differences should pose any technical
difficulties, except for the most computationally expensive models.

Conclusions
This note describes a novel method integrating existing resources
for literature searches, text mining, and computational chemistry.
The method has potential applicability in experimental design, drug
development, omics-data integration, and historical studies of scientific
fields. It may also be used for business intelligence, characterizing
strengths and weaknesses, and identifying potential opportunities
by comparing products from competing vendors. Linking meaningful categories,
functions, or quantitative properties to text-mined items semantically
enhances the literature searches, and their aggregation and visualization
provide in a single picture an overview of an analytical technique
or methodology.
