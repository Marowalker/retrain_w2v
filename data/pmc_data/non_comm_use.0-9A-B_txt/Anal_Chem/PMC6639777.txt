Protein structures
respond to changes in their chemical and physical
environment. However, studying such conformational changes is notoriously
difficult, as many structural biology techniques are also affected
by these parameters. Here, the use of photo-crosslinking, coupled
with quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry (QCLMS), offers an
opportunity, since the reactivity of photo-crosslinkers is unaffected
by changes in environmental parameters. In this study, we introduce
a workflow combining photo-crosslinking using sulfosuccinimidyl 4,4′-azipentanoate
(sulfo-SDA) with our recently developed data-independent acquisition
(DIA)-QCLMS. This novel photo-DIA-QCLMS approach is then used to quantify
pH-dependent conformational changes in human serum albumin (HSA) and
cytochrome C by monitoring crosslink abundances as a function of pH.
Both proteins show pH-dependent conformational changes resulting in
acidic and alkaline transitions. 93% and 95% of unique residue pairs
(URP) were quantifiable across triplicates for HSA and cytochrome
C, respectively. Abundance changes of URPs and hence conformational
changes of both proteins were visualized using hierarchical clustering.
For HSA we distinguished the N–F and the N–B form from
the native conformation. In addition, we observed for cytochrome C
acidic and basic conformations. In conclusion, our photo-DIA-QCLMS
approach distinguished pH-dependent conformers of both proteins.

==== Body
The structure
of proteins depends
on their chemical and physical environment, such as the presence of
denaturants, ionic strength, temperature, or pH.1−6 Studying conformational changes as these environmental parameters
change is notoriously difficult as many methods of structural biology
are themselves affected by the same set of parameters. We set out
to investigate whether crosslinking mass spectrometry could be employed
in such settings.

The structure of proteins and protein complexes
can be revealed
through crosslinking mass spectrometry (CLMS).7−13 By forming covalent bonds between the crosslinker and amino acids,
proximal amino acid residues in proteins can be detected. Following
the proteolytic digestion of a protein, crosslinked peptides can be
enriched by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX)14 or size exclusion chromatography (SEC),15 for example, and identified using liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC-MS). Quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry
reveals structural flexibility and changes in proteins such as protein
state changes including activation, protein network, and enzyme activity
regulation, complex assembly, or protein–protein interactions.16 However, crosslinking with standard crosslinkers
such as bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3), which contains
two NHS groups, is influenced by parameters such as pH and temperature.
As such, it is not possible to study conformational changes of proteins
across a wide range of pH or temperature values.

As an alternative
to NHS-based crosslinkers such as BS,3 photoactivatable
crosslinkers can be used in
CLMS.17−20 The crosslinking reaction is initiated by UV radiation21,22 and yields a highly reactive carbene intermediate that can react
with a variety of groups present in amino acid side chains.23,24 Photo-crosslinking results in more crosslinks than homo-bifunctional
NHS-based crosslinkers that are restricted to nucleophilic groups.20 Importantly, since photo-crosslinking chemistry
is not influenced by environmental parameters, it may be used to quantify
at the residue level conformational changes of proteins resulting
from varying conditions, once the crosslinker has been covalently
linked to the protein of interest with an inactive diazirine group.

To explore photo-crosslinking as a tool for analyzing pH-dependent
conformational changes, we used two model proteins: human serum albumin
(HSA) and bovine cytochrome C. HSA and cytochrome C are known to undergo
structural changes under different pH conditions.25−28 Human serum albumin is the globular
protein in human blood plasma whose main ability is to bind organic
and inorganic ligands. Investigation of its denaturation is important
for understanding its function as a transporter of physiological metabolites
in blood. At least five different pH-dependent conformations have
been described for HSA.29 Cytochrome C
is a small heme-containing protein found loosely associated with the
inner membrane of mitochondria. It is an essential component of the
electron transport chain in which it carries electrons between complexes
III (coenzyme Q–cytochrome C reductase) and IV (cytochrome
C oxidase). Similarly to HSA, cytochrome C undergoes conformational
changes depending on pH conditions. Alkaline pH and certain biochemical
and biophysical cellular factors induce the so-called “alkaline
transition”.30,31 Conformational changes at acidic
and neutral pH lead to the interaction of cytochrome C with phospholipids.32,33

Here, we present a workflow combining photo-crosslinking and
data-independent
acquisition–quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry (DIA-QCLMS)
to study pH-dependent conformational changes and apply it to two model
proteins, HSA and cytochrome C. We determine the differential abundance
of crosslinked residue pairs in response to different pH conditions.
Our study shows that, with use of sulfosuccinimidyl 4,4′-azipentanoate
(sulfo-SDA) as the crosslinker, we could pinpoint regions within a
protein structure displaying pH-dependent conformational or dynamic
changes. Sulfo-SDA is a commonly used hetero-bifunctional crosslinker
containing two functional groups: an NHS ester and a diazirine group.
First, the NHS ester reacts with the amino acid residues of a protein,
followed by the loss of the diazirine group in a second step, induced
by UV light exposure.18,34 Relying on established sulfo-SDA
analyses of proteins18 and our DIA workflow
using Spectronaut,35 we expand the application
spectrum of crosslinking mass spectrometry to the wide range of conditions
found in life.

Methods
Reagents
Human
serum albumin (HSA) and cytochrome C
(bovine heart) were purchased individually from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). The crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl 4,4′-azipentanoate
was purchased from Thermo Scientific Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA).

Photo-crosslinking Reaction and Sample Preparation
HSA and
cytochrome C were crosslinked separately with sulfo-SDA using
a protein-to-crosslinker ratio of 1:0.5 (w/w) (HSA, 15.1 μM:1.5
mM; cytochrome C, 85 μM:1.5 mM). crosslinking was carried out
in two stages: first, sulfo-SDA, dissolved in crosslinking buffer
(20 mM HEPES–OH, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8)
was added to the target proteins (1 μg/μL total protein
concentration) and left to react in the dark for 50 min at room temperature.
The sample was then split into seven vials, each adjusted to a different
pH, using HCl (18.5%) to lower the pH (pH 4, 5, 6, 7) and NaOH (1
mol/L) to reach basic pH (pH 8, 9, 10). The diazirine group was then
photoactivated using ultraviolet light irradiation. A UVP CL-1000L
UV crosslinker (UVP, U.K.) at 365 nm was utilized for photoactivation.
Samples were spread onto the inside of Eppendorf tube lids to form
a thin film, placed on ice at a distance of 5 cm from the lamp, and
irradiated for 30 min at 200,000 μJ/cm2. The resulting
crosslinked HSA and cytochrome C samples were separated by SDS-PAGE.
crosslinked monomer protein gel bands were excised, reduced, alkylated,
and digested using trypsin, as previously described.36 Resulting peptides were extracted from gel bands using
80% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) and concentrated to a final ACN content
of nominally 5% (v/v) using a Vacufuge concentrator (Eppendorf, Germany).
Tryptic peptides were desalted using C18–StageTips37 and eluted with 80% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% (v/v)
TFA prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides were dried in the
Vacufuge concentrator and resuspended in 2% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
(FA) to a final protein concentration
of 0.75 μg/μL.

Data Acquisition
LC-MS/MS analysis
was performed using
a quadrupole/linear ion trap/Orbitrap tribrid mass spectrometer (Orbitrap
Fusion Lumos, Thermo Fisher Scientific, California, USA) with a “high/high”
acquisition strategy (high resolution on MS1 and MS2). A 1.5 μg
amount of peptides was injected for data-dependent acquisition (DDA)
and data-independent acquisition (DIA) experiments. The peptide separation
was carried out on an EASY-Spray column (50 cm × 75 μm
i.d., PepMap C18, 2 μm particles, 100 Å pore
size, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Peptides were separated
using a 85 min gradient and analyzed in DDA mode as previously described.38 In short, mobile phase A consisted of water
and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) and mobile phase B consisted of 80%
(v/v) ACN and 0.1% (v/v) FA. Peptides were loaded onto the column
with 2% buffer B at 0.3 μL/min flow rate and eluted at 0.25
μL/min flow rate with the following gradient: 75 min linear
increase from 2 to 37.5% mobile phase B followed by 7 min increase
from 37.5 to 47.5%, and 3 min from 47.5 to 95% mobile phase B. Precursor
ions were detected in the Orbitrap at 120 K resolution in the m/z range 400–1600. Ions with charge
states from 3+ to 7+ were selected for fragmentation by high energy
collision dissociation (HCD) and detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000
resolution.39 In DIA mode, precursor ions
were acquired using an MS1 master scan (m/z range, 400–1200; maximum injection time, 60 ms;
automatic gain control (AGC) target, 4 × 105; detector,
Orbitrap; resolution, 60,000), following 66 DIA scans for MS2 within
a fragmentation range of m/z 120–1200
using an isolation window width of m/z 12 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Ions in the selected m/z window were isolated in the quadrupole,
fragmented using HCD (normalized collision energy, 30%), and detected
in the Orbitrap at 30K resolution.

Identification
of crosslinked Peptides
The raw mass
spectrometric data files were processed into peak lists and converted
to mgf files using MSconvert (v. 3.0.9576).40 Xi (v. 1.6.731)41 was used for database
searches. The database comprised the sequences of HSA (UniProt ID, P02768), cytochrome
C (P62894) separately, and the reverse sequence of each of these proteins
as decoys. Search parameters were as follows: MS tolerance, 6 ppm;
MS/MS tolerance, 10 ppm; enzyme, trypsin; missed cleavages, 3; crosslinker,
SDA; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation of cysteine; variable
modification, oxidation of methionine and modification by SDA (SDA,
SDA-loop, SDA-alkene, SDA-oxid, SDA-hydro) with SDA reaction specificity
at lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and N-termini of proteins
for the NHS-ester group. Diazirines react with all amino acid residues
in proteins.18,20 In a crosslink analysis, the
false discovery rate (FDR) can be calculated on different information
levels: peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), peptide pairs, residue pairs
(RPs), and protein pairs.42 Here, we considered
residue-pair FDR, which was estimated using xiFDR (v. 1.0.22.46)42 following the equation valid for heterobifunctional
crosslinkers:43 FDR = (TD
– DD)/TT,43 where
TT is the number of observed target–target matches, TD the
number of observed target–decoy matches, and DD the number
of decoy–decoy matches. Filtering was applied to only use crosslink
PSMs within proteins. Identification with 5% residue-pair FDR was
accepted for quantitation.

Creation of Crosslinked Spectral Library
and Quantitation
Quantitation was performed at MS1 and MS2
levels using Spectronaut
(version 12.0.20491.13).44,45 The spectral library
of crosslinked peptides was introduced as a .csv file using xiDIA-library
as previously described.46 In short, xiDIA-library
(an open source collaborative initiative available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/Rappsilber-Laboratory/xiDIA-library) was used to extract the top 10 crosslink-containing fragments and
the top 10 linear ones by the intensity of b- or y-ion signals in
the m/z range of 300–1400.
The library was imported as an external library. Protein modifications
were defined manually in addition to a default list of modifications
in Spectronaut: SDA-loop (82.04 Da), SDA-alkene (68.06 Da), SDA-oxid
(98.04 Da), SDA-hydro (100.05 Da), and SDA-N2 (110.05 Da).47,48 MS1 and MS2 filtering was done following the Spectronaut 12 manual
with the following deviations: quantitation tab, interference correction
unticked; minor (peptide) grouping, by modified sequence; major group
top N unticked and minor group top N ticket (maximum, 6; minimum,
1); minor group quantity, mean precursor quantity, decoy method was
set to “scrambled”. Normalized data (local normalization49 option) with a q-value of 0.01
(comparable to 1% FDR) were exported from Spectronaut to integrate
feature-level quantitation data into residue-level data using a top
3 approach.

For each unique residue pair (URP), pH dependency
was assessed by a single-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test against
the null hypothesis that the mean is equal in all groups. After applying
the Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction, URPs displaying p-values < 0.05 in the ANOVA test were selected. Using
this criterion, 137 of the 742 unique residue pairs (URPs) in the
HSA data set were found to display pH-dependent behavior, while, in
the cytochrome C data set, 87 of the 300 URPs were selected for further
analysis. Once this filtering step was applied, direct comparison
between pH series was performed using normalized crosslink abundance
(XLnorm), obtained by 1  where XLpH is the median crosslink
abundance of a URP at a given pH, XLmin is the minimum
median abundance of the same crosslink across the pH series, and XLmax is its maximum. This results in the normalization of each
URP abundance between 0 and 1. The data processing was performed in
the statistical language R, and the subsequent hierarchical clustering
analysis was performed using the heatmap.2 function.50

Results and Discussion
Spectral Library and Library
Quality
We generated a
library of fragmentation spectra for data-independent acquisition
(DIA) analysis using data-dependent acquisition (DDA). We analyzed
two proteins, HSA and cytochrome C, each crosslinked separately in
solution using sulfo-SDA (Figure 1a). The sulfo-SDA reaction comprised two steps: first,
the NHS-ester functionality was reacted with the proteins at room
temperature and pH 7.8. Under these conditions, NHS-esters react efficiently
with lysine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine side chains and the N-termini
of proteins. The samples were then split into seven aliquots, and
the pH was adjusted to pH 4–10 in steps of one pH unit; in
the second step, the diazirine functionality was activated by UV light
at 365 nm. The carbene radical intermediate generated by diazirine
activation efficiently reacts with all amino acid residues.18 Proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and
protein monomer bands were excised for trypsin digestion to prevent
crosslinks between proteins from entering our analysis. To generate
spectral libraries, each pH condition was individually analyzed in
triplicates (totaling 21 runs at 2 h each, per protein) by LC-MS using
a “high–high” (high-resolution MS1 and MS2) strategy
and DDA (Figure 1b).
For quantitation, each pH condition was analyzed in triplicates and
acquired DIA mode. Protein-specific spectral libraries were then generated
using xiDIA-library (Müller et al.46 and Methods) and, in total, at 5% residue-pair
FDR, comprised 754 URPs, 1655 precursors, and 22808 fragments for
the HSA data set and 305 URPs, 1660 precursors, and 17077 fragments
for the cytochrome C data set. In comparison, a previous analysis
of sulfo-SDA–crosslinked HSA reported 726 URPs at 5% residue-pair
FDR, acquiring 48 runs.20 We selected the
top 10 crosslink-containing fragments and the top 10 linear ones by
the intensity of b- or y-ion signals for library creation. All URPs
from the HSA spectral library were covered by crystallographic protein
models, with 662 falling below 25 Å and 92 (12%) above. All 305
URPs form the cytochrome C library resulted in 299 below 25 Å
and 6 (2%) above. Importantly, the reference structures were solved
at a single pH value while the crosslink data derived from seven different
pH values. Both proteins change their conformation in response to
pH change,29,33 and we therefore expect some
mismatch between our data and the reference structures.

Sample preparation workflow using sulfo-SDA as the UV-activatable
crosslinker. First, the NHS ester group reacts with amino acid residues
of the model proteins HSA and cytochrome C to decorate the proteins
with diazirine groups. After pH adjustment in the range from 4 to
10, the diazirine group is activated to form links within proteins,
induced by UV light exposure. Differential abundances of crosslinks
can be monitored using a hierarchical clustering. (b) crosslink quantitation
workflow (DIA-QCLMS) using Spectronaut for quantitation. pH-adjusted
samples are acquired in DDA mode to create a spectral library, followed
by DIA mode sampling to generate quantitation data sets.

Quantitation was performed at MS1 and MS2 levels
using Spectronaut
(version 12.0.20491.13).44,45 The spectral library
of crosslinked peptides was introduced as a .csv file using the “Set
up a DIA Analysis from File” wizard in the Analysis tab. Following
the automated quantitation of crosslinked peptides, the data set was
exported using the Report tab. The identified-to-quantified ratios
for the HSA and cytochrome C data sets were 93% (744 out of 797) and
95% (300 out of 315), respectively.

Our raw data, peak files,
and results files are accessible in the ProteomeXchange(51) Consortium
via the PRIDE52 partner repository.

pH-Induced
Changes of HSA Structure
Human serum albumin
(HSA) undergoes several conformational changes when experiencing a
change in either pH, temperature, salt content in the environment,
or the concentration of the protein itself.29 Four isomers of the normal form (N-form, pH 6–7) are known
from previous studies.53 Within a pH range
between 4.5 and 2.7, HSA transforms into the fast form (F-form), below
2.7 it transforms into the expanded form (E-form), and in the basic
region from pH 8 to 10 it takes on the basic transition form (B-form)
and the aged form (A-form).29,53 Fluorescence measurements,
acidic/base titrations, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have
already been applied to indirectly characterize changes in the N →
B transition.1,53−56 Previous studies proposed that
the N → B transition of HSA is comparable with the transition
caused by the binding of fatty acids (e.g., small rotation of domains
I and III relative to domain II29,57,58). Binding sites of HSA are shown in Figure 2. We confirmed our ability to generate distinct
structural forms of HSA by changing pH conditions as was previously
reported,59 using CD spectroscopy (data
not shown).

Figure 2 Overview of the domain structure, ligand binding sites, and key
residues involved in conformational changes of human serum albumin
(HSA) using chain A of the PDB structure 1AO6 (blue, residues referring to the basic
transition; red, acidic transition; orange, binding site of diazepam
in Sudlow-site II; gray, domain I; sand, domain II; dark gray, domain
III).

To investigate the structural
differences of HSA in different pH
conditions, we crosslinked HSA using sulfo-SDA and quantified the
abundance of the individual crosslinks. HSA was crosslinked in different
pH conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE, digested in gel using trypsin,
and then underwent DIA-LC-MS/MS analysis. Automated quantitation was
performed in Spectronaut using our DDA-generated spectral library
described above. Normalized data (see Methods) were exported to visualize differences in peak areas of unique
residue pairs (URPs) for each pH condition by hierarchical clustering
(Figure 3b) based on
the changes in normalized median abundance of each URP data series.
We applied a cutoff to group the data into the four highest level
clusters and to display the pH-dependent abundance of a representative
residue pair for each cluster (Figure 3a). The clusters therefore classify URPs based on their
pH-dependent relative abundance.

Figure 3 Hierarchical clustering of normalized
median abundance of quantified
unique residue pairs (URPs) in HSA. (a) MS1 abundance behavior of
representative URPs from human serum albumin (where, for example,
1e+06 represents 1 × 106). The dots show the triplicate
MS1 abundance. The line is a smoothed polynomial fit with 95% confidence
interval. Representatives were selected on the basis of having features
closest to the cluster median. (b) Heat map of median abundances of
URPs displaying statistically significant shifts as a function of
pH (p < 0.05). Median abundances are normalized
between 0 and 1 as described in Methods. Hierarchical
clustering was performed by rows: blue, cluster 1; green, cluster
2; red, cluster 3; orange, cluster 4. (c) Visualization of residue
pairs corresponding to the four highest level clusters mapped on the
structure of human serum albumin (PDB accession code 1AO6). (d) Frequency
plot of the euclidean distances corresponding to the URPs within each
cluster fitted to a log-normal distribution, highlighting that the
crosslink distance distributions of URPs in cluster 4 and cluster
2 do not fit the model.

URPs corresponding to close the distances of domains I–III
are mainly sorted into cluster 3, which comprises URPs whose maximum
abundance is at neutral pH. This is loosened by a shift to acidic
conditions as seen by URPs sorted into cluster 4 with a maximum at
pH 4. Cluster 4 shows fewer links between domains I and III compared
to cluster 3 (pH 7), and a distance distribution that does not satisfy
the model of HSA under neutral conditions, as evidenced by the higher
proportion of overlength crosslinks. This is consistent with other
characterized motions of the protein such as a separation or rotation
of the two domains, possibly to capture or release ligands by entering
different compartments. HSA is known as a carrier molecule and hence
several binding sites provide interactions with ligands (Figure 2). Sudlow’s
side I, in domain IIA, is mostly responsible for interactions with
bulky heterocyclic anions, while Sudlow’s side II, located
in subdomain IIIA, mainly binds aromatic carboxylates.57,58 Several fatty acid (FA) binding sites (FA1–7) provide the
transportation abilities of fatty acids from adipose tissue. Previous
studies could show a rotation of domain I relative to domain II due
to the binding of FAs to Sudlow’s side I, and movement of Tyr150
to interact with the carboxylate moiety of the lipid. An extensive
rearrangement of H-bonds involving Try150, Glu153, Gln196, His242,
Arg257, and His288 is the consequence. Additionally, binding of diazepam
to Sudlow’s side II is accompanied by a rotation of Leu387
and Leu453 in domain III and consequent side chain movement to encourage
drug binding.57,60 Both effects may also be linked
to acidic pH conditions and explain the loss of connection between
domains I and III at pH 4, compared to the highly crosslinked domains
I–III connection at pH7.

URPs in clusters 1–2
have their maximum abundance at basic
pH. Cluster 2 is a cluster comprising a small number of residue pairs
with a maximum at pH 10 that are mostly located within domain I and
between domains I and II. Moreover, the observed distance distribution
of cluster 2 deviates from the expected distance distribution of SDA
in HSA, consistent with a conformational change of the protein at
pH 10. Cluster 1 shows URPs with maxima at pH 9, including crosslinks
in domain I and domains II and III. Especially notable is domain I
containing His9, His67, His105, and His146, which is heavily crosslinked
at pH 8, 9, and 10 (Figure 3c). Previous mutagenesis studies show that His9, His67, His105,
His146, and His128 contribute to basic transition.56 Increasing the pH results in deprotonation of residues
with a pKa value lower than 9.0, thus
triggering the N → B transition.54 crosslinks enriched in basic conditions also fell into domain III,
which is in line with previous reports of changes in this domain during
the N → B transition.53 The basic
transition process was previously described as a structural fluctuation
or loosening of human serum albumin including loss of rigidity.57 Overall, our data agree with this as we observed
equilibrium states with multiple minima rather than distinct conformation
states with just one minimum.

pH-Induced Changes of Cytochrome
C Structure
Given
its small size, cytochrome C (105 amino acids, 11 kDa) provides an
ideal test case for our method of investigating conformational changes
in a system of low complexity. The protein was treated as described
for HSA. The results of hierarchical clustering are shown in Figure 4b. We applied a cutoff
to group the data into the three highest level clusters and to display
the pH-dependent abundance of a representative residue pair for each
cluster (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 Hierarchical
clustering of normalized median abundance of quantified
unique residue pairs (URPs) in cytochrome C. (a) MS1 abundance behavior

represents 1.5 × 106). The dots show the triplicate
MS1 abundance. The line is a smoothed polynomial fit with 95% confidence
interval. Representatives were selected on the basis of having features
closest to the cluster median. (b) Heat map of median abundances of
URPs displaying statistically significant shifts as a function of
pH (p < 0.05). Median abundances are normalized
between 0 and 1 as described in Methods. Hierarchical
clustering was performed by rows: blue, cluster 1; red, cluster 2;
green, cluster 3. (c) Visualization of residue pairs corresponding
to the three highest level clusters onto the structure of cytochrome
C (PDB accession code 2b4z).

Cluster 1 includes residue
pairs which have a maximum at pH 4,
cluster 2 at pH 9, and cluster 3 at pH 6–8. The alkaline transition
in cytochrome C is described by crosslinks in cluster 2. Links in
this cluster are enriched in helix regions 2 (51–55), 3 (62–68),
and 4 (72–75) and surrounding Ω-loops, which could indicate flexibility
of the protein induced by pH (Figure 4c and Figure 5d). The high crosslinking density in helix regions 2 (51–55),
3 (62–68), and 4 (72–75) and surrounding Ω-loops
is in line with previous studies analyzing the alkaline-transition
of cytochrome C,31 which show that Met80
is replaced as a ligand of Fe in the heme group with the ε-amino
group of a neighboring lysine residue or other surrogate ligands.
The change in ligand is thought to increase access of peroxides to
the heme center and thus increase the peroxidase activity of cytochrome
C.33 The peroxidase activity is critical
for translocating cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytoplasm
and nucleolus at the onset of apoptosis.61,62 Additionally, conformational changes induced by a basic pH lead
to the interaction of cytochrome C with cardiolipin, which influences
homeostasis and stress response in cells.63,64

residue pairs matching the PDB (2b4z) crystal structure of cytochrome C. (a)
Known residues, helix, and loop regions triggering alkaline and acidic
conformational changes in cytochrome C (red, acidic transition; blue,
alkaline transition; black, heme group). (b) Residue pairs having
maximum abundance at pH ≤ 5, corresponding to the acidic form
of cytochrome C (red, links below the distance limit of 25 Å;
blue, links longer than 25 Å). (c) Residue pairs having maximum
abundance at pH 6–7, corresponding to the neutral form (red,
links below the distance limit of 25 Å; blue, links longer than
25 Å). (d) Residue pairs having maximum abundance at pH ≥
8, corresponding to the alkaline form (red, links below the distance
limit of 25 Å; blue, links longer than 25 Å).

In neutral and acidic conditions (clusters 1 and
3), crosslinks
are distributed over the entire protein but more frequently between
helix regions 5 (89–102) and 3 (62–68) including interconnecting
Ω-loops (Figure 4c). crosslinks with high abundance at pH 4 and 5 are combined in Figure 5b to represent the
acidic transformation of cytochrome C. The crosslink density is not
as localized as for the alkaline transition; nevertheless many crosslinks
are concentrated within helix region 5 (89–102), Ω-loop
(40–54), and Ω-loop (70–85). Notably, unfolding
of δ-loop (40–54) is a known trigger for the acidic transition
of cytochrome C.65 The H-bond connection
between the imidazole ring of His26 and side chain of Glu44 is disrupted
at lower pH. This process induces Met80 substitution by water and
thus activates the acidic unfolding pathway of cytochrome C, which
would allow crosslinking within the whole protein. Interestingly,
the normal form (pH 6–7) shows just a few characteristic crosslinks.
This could be linked to the presence of the heme group in the center
of the protein, which might sterically interfere with crosslinking
(Figure 5c).

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrate that protein structure can be analyzed
under different pH conditions through the use of photo-crosslinking
mass spectrometry. Thus, structural changes in proteins can be monitored
across a wide range of environmental changes, including pH as shown
here, but presumably also temperature, pressure, or concentration.
Using standard crosslinkers, this would not be possible as the traditionally
employed chemistry is itself influenced by these environmental factors.
For standard crosslinkers, changes in crosslink abundance can therefore
be linked to a changed structure or to a changed reactivity. These
restrictions do not apply to photochemistry, allowing us to probe
protein structures here over a pH range from 4 to 10. Although crosslinking
involves labeling a protein and thus artifacts cannot be excluded,
the overall fold appears to be maintained.66 It will be exciting to see whether our photo-DIA-QCLMS workflow
can also be adapted to reveal structural changes induced by environmental
parameters within cells.
