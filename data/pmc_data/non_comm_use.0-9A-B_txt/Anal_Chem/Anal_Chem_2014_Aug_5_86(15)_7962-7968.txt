We report new substrates for quantitative
enzyme activity measurements
of human palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT1) and tripeptidyl peptidase
(TPP1) in dried blood spots from newborns using tandem mass spectrometry.
Deficiencies in these enzyme activities due to inborn errors of metabolism
cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. The assays use synthetic compounds
that were designed to mimic the natural substrates. Incubation produces
nanomole quantities of enzymatic products per a blood spot that are
quantified by tandem mass spectrometry using synthetic internal standards
and selected reaction monitoring. The assays utilize a minimum steps
for sample workup and can be run in a duplex format for the detection
of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses or potentially multiplexed with
other mass spectrometry-based assays for newborn screening of lysosomal
storage disorders.

==== Body
The neuronal
ceroid lipofuscinoses
(NCLs) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders primarily affecting
children and adolescents. NCLs are inherited as autosomal recessive
disorders that cause neurodegenerative diseases manifesting similar
clinical features, including seizures, mental regression, visual loss,
behavior changes, movement disorders, and shortened life expectancy
in affected individuals.1 Of the two most
prevalent forms, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL),
also called the Santavuori-Haltia disease,2 is caused by mutations in the CLN1 gene located
on chromosome 1p32, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl protein
thioesterase I (PPT1, EC3.1.2.22). Over 40 mutations of the CLN1 gene are known.3 PPT1 cleaves
thioester-linked fatty acid groups from C-terminal cysteine residues
in lipoproteins. PPT1 is structurally similar to lipases and has a
peptide binding site as well as a well-defined fatty acid binding
pocket.4 The other NCL form, classic late
infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL II, also called the
Jansky-Bielschowsky disease5) results from
mutations in the TPPI gene (previously named CLN2)6 which is located on chromosome
11p15 and encodes the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidylpeptidase 1 (TPP1).1,2 TPP1 is a serine protease that cleaves three amino acid residues
from unsubstituted protein N-termini. The human form of TPP1 shows
preferential cleavage of the Ala-Ala-Phe peptide triad.7

Collectively, NCLs are estimated to constitute
the most common
hereditary neurodegenerative disorder in childhood2 with an estimated prevalence of 1:12 500 newborns
in the U.S.2,3 A particularly high incidence of INCL is
found in Finland where it is due to a missense mutation (W122R).2 NCLs are incurable disorders, and
treatment of affected children has been mainly supportive. However,
recent reports of enzyme replacement therapies8−10 and neuronal
stem transplantation11,12 indicated that animals treated
with recombinant enzymes showed significantly decreased levels of
lysosomal storage material. This could possibly open an avenue for
the development of a therapy for human NCLs.12 Because INCL is characterized by early onset (6 months to 1 year)
and rapid progression, the success of any potential therapy strongly
depends on early diagnosis. A detection strategy for such rare metabolic
disorders, which is currently being explored on a large scale,13 is by screening the enzyme defects in dried
blood spots (DBSs) collected from entire newborn populations.

The most direct and specific diagnosis of NCLs relies on enzymatic
assays in biological samples such as leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts,
using radiometric or fluorescence detection. The radiometric method
for PPT1 measures the release of tritium-labeled palmitate from a
palmitate-labeled H-Ras protein.14 The
fluorometric assay for PPT1, developed by van Diggelen et al.,15 uses an S-palmitoyl-6-thiogalactosylcoumarin
conjugate that requires a coupling enzyme to release the fluorescent
7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin for detection. The fluorometric assay for
TPP1 uses Ala-Ala-Pro-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin15 that releases the fluorescent 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
upon enzymatic hydrolysis.16 These assays
have been applied to analysis of dried blood spots from newborns.17

We have previously reported several assays
of lysosomal enzyme
activities in DBSs using tandem mass spectrometry and selected reaction
monitoring (SRM).18 Our strategy has been
to assay the enzymes with synthetic compounds that are structurally
similar to the natural enzyme substrates and at the same time allow
highly sensitive and specific detection of products by SRM-tandem
mass spectrometry. The assays are designed to allow for simple sample
handling and purification to be compatible with the work flow in newborn
screening laboratories. The substrates are designed for multiplexed
detection of several enzyme products and their quantitation by SRM
in a single analytical run. Recent results of a pilot triplex study
of over 100 000 DBS samples from newborns in Washington state
showed a very low rate (<0.005%) of false positives, which indicated
that multiplex analysis by tandem mass spectrometry is a robust and
practical method of newborn screening for lysosomal storage disorders.13

Here, we report two new assays of TPP1
and PPT1 that utilize synthetic
substrates closely mimicking the natural ones. The synthetic substrates
are designed such as to make the new assays potentially multiplexable
for tandem mass spectrometry analysis with assays developed so far
for several other lysosomal enzymes.19,20

Experimental
Section
Materials
All water used was purified by a Millipore
Milli-Q 18 MΩ System. N-acetylated heptapeptides ALLPFGC and
AAAPFGC, and Fmoc-protected AAF were purchased from Lifetein (Hillsborough,
NJ). Palmitoyl chloride (98% pure), Fmoc-4-aminomethylbenzoic acid, N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride, and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). All solvents used were
technical grade as supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Triton X-100 was purchased
from ACROS (NJ, USA). Solid phase extraction C18 Omix pipette tips
were supplied by Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). All experiments and sample
handling were conducted in compliance with Institutional Review Board
guidelines. All infantile CLN1 and CLN2 affected patients had been diagnosed previously with established
clinical and biochemical procedures. DBSs were stored at −20
°C in zip-lock plastic bags (one bag sealed inside a second bag).
Zip-lock bags were kept in a sealed plastic box containing desiccant
(anhydrous CaSO4 granules). Details of the substrate synthesis
are given in the Supporting Information.

Mass Spectrometry
Electrospray-MS/MS was carried out
on a Waters Quattro Micro tandem quadrupole (quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole)
instrument using a positive ionization mode and selected reaction
monitoring (SRM). Samples (10 μL) were flow-injected with an
autosampler in an acetonitrile/water (v/v = 80:20) solution containing
0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The mass spectrometer
settings were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; cone, 35 V; extractor,
2.0 V; RF lens, 0.2 V; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation
temperature, 250 °C; cone gas flow, 50 L/h; desolvation gas flow,
500 L/h; LM 1 resolution, 14.8; HM 1 resolution, 14.8; ion energy
1, 0.2 eV; entrance, 2 V; collision, 25 eV; exit, 15 V; LM 2 resolution,
14.8; HM 2 resolution, 14.8; ion energy 2, 1.0 eV; multiplier, 650
V; gas cell Pirani pressure, 2.21 × 10–3 mbar;
dwell time, 100 ms. Shorter dwell times (10 ms) were also investigated
on the Quattro Micro instrument but led to increased coefficients
of variation (CV) for intra-assay measurements from 1.5% at 100 ms
to 4% at 10 ms, all for triplicate injections. The precursor ion-fragment
ion SRM transitions for the PPT1 assays were monitored at m/z 762.5 → m/z 423.5 and m/z 678.4
→ m/z 423.4 for PPT1-P and
PPTI-IS, respectively, corresponding to the formation of the abundant y4 fragment ion of the peptide (Figure 1). The SRM transitions for the TPP1 assays were
monitored at m/z 308.3 → m/z 208.3 and m/z 317.3 → m/z 209.3
for TPP1-P and TPP1-IS, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.

Assay Protocols
PPT1 Assay
A 3 mm punch of a dried blood spot was placed
in a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube (Eppendorf) and 100 μL of 100
mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) containing 46 nmol PPT1 substrate
(PPT1-S) and 2.6 nmol PPT1 internal standard (PPT1-IS) and 0.08% v/v
Triton X-100(ACROS, Cat No. 21568) was added. The solution was then
vortexed briefly and incubated for 10 h at 37 °C in a thermostated
air shaker at 250 rpm. After the incubation period was over, the sample
was placed in an ice bath and the reaction was quenched by addition
of 300 μL of ethyl acetate and 100 μL of deionized water.
The tubes were vortexed and centrifuged, and the ethyl acetate layer
containing Triton X-100 was separated and discarded. The assay product
(PPT1-P) and internal standard (PPT1-IS) were isolated and desalted
by solid phase extraction on C18 pipette tips (Omix Tips, Agilent
Cat No. A57003100) followed by elution with 200 μL of a 50:50
acetonitrile:water with 1% acetic acid. Prior to injection into the
mass spectrometer, the samples were treated with 800 μM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride, TCEP (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. C4706) and incubated
for 30 min at 37 °C to reduce disulfide bonds formed by cysteine
oxidation during the assay.

TPP1 Assay
TPP1
substrate solution was prepared by
dissolving 5 mg of TPP1 substrate in 1.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). One milligram of TPP1 IS was dissolved in 1.5 mL of assay
buffer, which contained 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer
at pH 4.0. This concentrated TPP1 IS solution was further diluted
with stock assay buffer to make a 300 μM IS solution. The assay
cocktail was a 100 μL mixture composed of 7.2 μL of substrate
solution (40 nmol), 5 μL of 300 μM IS solution (1.5 nmol),
and an additional 87.8 μL of stock assay buffer. A 3 mm punch
of a dried blood spot (DBS) was placed in a 1.5 mL polypropylene Eppendorf
tube containing 100 μL of assay cocktail. The solution was then
vortexed briefly and incubated for 10 h at 37 °C in a thermostated
air shaker at 250 rpm. After incubation, 10 μL of 15% aqueous
trifluoroacetic acid was added to quench the assay, followed by 200
μL of 1 M NaOH, and then 800 μL of ethyl acetate. The
mixture was vortexed, centrifuged, and 750 μL of the top ethyl
acetate layer was collected to dry. Then the dried residue was reconstituted
in 200 μL of acetonitrile/water (v/v = 50:50) with 1% acetic
acid for analysis by MS.

Results
Design and
Synthesis of Substrates and Internal Standards
The PPT1 substrate
is a cysteine terminated heptapeptide carrying
an S-palmitoyl group, N-Ac-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Phe-Gly-Cys-S-COC11H23. Acetylation of the N-terminus
protects the substrate and the PPT1 product from being attacked by
serum exopeptidases that are present and may be active in rehydrated
DBSs. The internal standard, N-Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-Gly-Cys,
is homologous with the depalmitylated enzyme product, N-Ac-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Phe-Gly-Cys. The amino acid residues in the substrate,
product, and internal standard were designed with two features in
mind. One was to produce peptides that would be sufficiently lipophilic
to be readily extracted on the C18 solid-phase support. The other
feature was to promote residue-selective ion fragmentation upon collisional
activation that would focus most of the fragment ion signal into a
single dominant dissociation channel. This was accomplished by incorporating
in the peptides the proline residue that directs the backbone fragmentation
to form a dominant y4 ion at m/z 423, which is common for the enzyme product and
the internal standard (Figure 1). The PPT1
substrate was prepared by the single step palmitoylation of a readily
available peptide precursor according to Rijkers et al.21 (Scheme S1, Supporting Information).

The substrate for TPP1 (TPP1-S, Figure 2) is a conjugate containing the Ala-Ala-Phe triad, which is
preferentially cleaved by the enzyme,7 that
is linked by an amide bond to a nonpeptidic moiety. The latter consists
of an 4-aminobenzylcarboxamide, a 1,3-propanediamine, and a t-butyloxycarbamate group (t-BOC). The
product (TPP1-P) and internal standard (TPP1-IS) retain the hydrophobic
benzyl, propylene, and t-BOC linkers to be readily
extracted in ethyl acetate or on C18 solid-phase support. The t-BOC group allows for the introduction of a deuterium label
in the IS.20 Upon collisional activation,
ions containing the t-BOC group readily dissociate
by consecutive loss of C4H8 and CO2,22 which provides suitable channels for
selected reaction monitoring. The ion transitions of the TPP1 product
and IS, m/z 308 → m/z 208 and m/z 317 → m/z 209,
respectively (Figure S1, Supporting Information), overlap with none of the other products and internal standards
in the LSD assay cassette,19,20,23 thus allowing multiplex quantitation by SRM. The TPP1 substrate
was synthesized from the components by standard coupling reactions
in five steps (Scheme S2), as described in the Supporting Information. The product and d9-internal standard were prepared in four steps (Scheme
S3, Supporting Information).

Assay Evaluation
and Optimization
Both assays were
evaluated and optimized regarding the incubation conditions affecting
the enzyme activity, workup procedures affecting the product and IS
recovery, and mass spectrometric analysis affecting the ionization
efficiency and collision induced dissociation. Results of the relevant
measurements are summarized in Figures S2–S8 in the Supporting Information.

The PPT1 activity
is known to have an optimum activity at pH 7 when acting on a natural
substrate.14 The PPT1 activity in the DBS
with respect to the synthetic PPT1 substrate showed a similar pH dependence,
increasing from pH 4 to 8 (Figure S2, top, Supporting
Information). However, nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the thioester
bond in the PPT1 substrate substantially increased between pH 7 and
8. Therefore, the assay pH was adjusted to pH 7, which showed a maximum
activity after a blank correction (Figure S2, bottom, Supporting Information). The TPP1 activity toward
TPP1-S showed a pH dependence profile that was more typical of a lysosomal
enzyme, peaking at pH 4 (Figure S3, Supporting
Information). The production of TPP-P by nonenzymatic hydrolysis
in the blank sample at pH 4 was ca. 15-fold lower than that due to
TPP1 activity in the DBS.

The PPT1 activity as a function of
the amount of enzyme was established
by conducting the assays with an increasing number of DBS punches
from a single donor. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) shows that the PPT1 activity increased approximately linearly with
the number of DBSs used for the assay. The amount of product obtained
from a single DBS punch (2 nmol) was sufficient for activity enzyme
measurements in the assays.

The PPT1 activity showed a pseudolinear
increase with incubation
times from 1 to 10 h and then it leveled off at longer incubation
times (Figure S5, top, Supporting Information). The leveling-off effect can be in part due to enzymatic digestion
of PPT1-P by proteolytic enzymes in rehydrated DBSs. This was checked
by incubating synthetic PPT1-P in the assay buffer with a DBS for
18 h. The incubation resulted in 25–27% decrease of PPT1-P
compared to a control sample. Because PPT1-P and PPT1-IS are similar
hydrophobic peptides, it is safe to presume that their depletion will
occur at similar rates and will not affect their molar ratio. The
TPP1 activity showed a gradual increase with incubation time with
a pseudolinear portion of the curve between 3 and 13 h (Figure S5,
bottom, Supporting Information). On the
basis of these measurements, the incubation time for both PPT1 and
TPP1 was set at 10 h. The average PPT1 and TPP1 substrate conversions
at 10 h of incubation were 5% and 1%, respectively.

The enzyme
kinetics with respect to the synthetic substrates was
established through Michaelis–Menten plots, which were fitted
to obtain the Km and Vmax values (Figure S6, Supporting
Information). Each Michaelis–Menten curve was obtained
from triplicate activity measurements over an appropriate substrate
concentration range (0–500 and 0–300 μM). The
PPT1 substrate showed Km = 0.23 mM and Vmax = 217.0 μmol
L–1 h–1. The TPP1 substrate showed Km = 53.3 μM and Vmax = 46.0 μmol L–1 h–1. The measured Km were
used to adjust the initial substrate concentrations in the assays
to ≥2 Km value, e.g., 0.46 and
0.40 mM for PPT1-S and TPP1-S, respectively.

Assay and Sample Workup
Conditions
ESI-MS/MS analysis
of the assays requires that the samples be dissolved in a compatible
solvent free of nonvolatile salts and detergents. The presence of
a surfactant in the PPT1 assay buffer further accentuates the need
for matrix removal. Liquid–liquid extraction is a well-established
method of assay sample purification, and it was investigated for PPT1-P
and IS using different organic solvents. However, we found that ethyl
acetate, n-butanol, and 8:1:1 ethyl acetate-n-butanol-n-hexanol mixture were ineffective
in extracting the product and internal standard. In addition, the
nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) was also extracted into the organic
layer and interfered with mass spectrometric analysis. Therefore,
liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate was utilized to
first remove Triton X-100 from the samples, whereas recovery of PPT1-P
and IS was achieved by subsequent solid phase extraction (SPE). Standard
C18 SPE pipette tips (Omix Tips) were found to selectively extract
PPT1-P and IS from the aqueous phase of the assay whereas buffer salts
can be washed away. The peptides were released by elution with a 50:50
mixture of acetonitrile–water that achieved recoveries of 52
and 50% (both ±2%) for PPT1-P and IS, respectively. This acetonitrile–water
mixture does not elute the substantially more lipophilic PPT1-S from
the solid phase, so the substrate does not interfere with mass spectrometric
analysis. Prior to injecting the samples in the mass spectrometer,
disulfide bonds spuriously formed by cysteine oxidation under the
assay conditions must be reduced. TCEP was selected as the reducing
agent, and the optimal concentration required for quantitative reduction
was determined to be 0.8 mM (Figure S7, Supporting
Information).

Liquid–liquid extraction into ethyl
acetate of TPP1-P and IS performed with 76 ± 2% recovery in a
single step. These compounds are chemically identical except for the
presence of deuterium isotopes in TPP1-IS and can be expected to have
similar partition coefficients for extraction into ethyl acetate.
The different incubation and workup conditions for PPT1 and TPP1 assays
precluded coincubation in a single duplex assay or sample combination
prior to workup. However, duplex mass spectrometric quantitation was
possible, as described below.

Mass Spectrometric Response
The workup procedures for
TPP1 and PPT1 products and internal standards resulted in very similar
recoveries, indicating practically no bias in the concentrations of
the P and IS in the samples subjected for mass spectrometric analysis.
The responses in SRM for TPP1 and PPT1 products and internal standards
were determined to ensure accurate quantitation of the product formation
in enzyme assays. Figure S8 (Supporting Information) shows the observed relative responses (P/IS reporter ion intensity
ratios) plotted against the calculated concentration ratios. Both
response curves show a satisfactory linearity (r2 ≈ 0.99) and slopes close to 1. SRM of PPT1-P shows
about a 10% higher response than that of PPT1-IS. The nature of this
difference has not been determined, although slightly different ionization
efficiencies of the N-Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-Gly-Cys
(PPT1-P) and N-Ac-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Phe-Gly-Cys (PPT1-IS)
peptides in electrospray, as well as different ion fragmentation efficiencies
for the reporter y4ion formation, are
not unexpected. The slope for the TPP1-P/IS response, 0.9995 ±
0.003, r2 = 0.998, indicated a nearly
identical response to the product and internal standard.

Clinical Sample
Analysis
PPT1 assays were performed
with 62 random newborn samples that were obtained from the Washington
State Newborn Screening Laboratory under Institutional Review Board
guidelines, and five previously diagnosed infantile NCL patients (Figure 3). The amount of product formed was calculated using
the SRM intensity ratios of the product to the internal standard,
the known concentration of the internal standard, and the response
ratio (P/IS = 1.104, Figure S8, top, Supporting
Information). The data are compiled in Table S1 (Supporting Information). A small amount of PPT1-P
is formed by nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate at pH 7.0, giving
a mean assay/blank ratio of 16.3. Therefore, all assay data were subjected
to blank correction. Enzymatic activity was calculated as μmol
h–1 (L of blood)−1 from the amount
of product formed, incubation time, and volume of blood. The blood
volume in the DBS was estimated at 3.2 μL, based on the estimated
volume of a blood spot (10 μL) and the punch/DBS area ratio.

representation of PPT1 activities in DBS from simplex
assays.

Unaffected newborns showed a range
of PPT1 activities from 71 to
213 μmol h–1 L–1 with a
mean at 147 μmol h–1 L–1. Patients affected with infantile NCL (PPT1 deficiency) displayed
a range of activities between 12 and 18 μ mol h–1 L–1 with a mean value of 15 μmol h–1 L–1. Blanks combining all the components of the
assay but replacing the DBS punch with a filter paper punch were analyzed,
and the activities were in the range of 6.5 to 13.4 μmol h–1 L–1 with a mean value of 9.0 μmol
h–1 L–1. Assay precision was calculated
using DBSs from a healthy adult control sample. The intra-assay coefficient
of variation (CV) was 3.2% (n = 5), calculated from
five injections of the sample from the incubation of a single DBS.
The interassay CV was 15% that involved 10 injections from different
DBS punches while avoiding the blood spot perimeter.

TPP1 assays
were performed with DBS samples from 54 random newborns,
obtained with IRB approval from the Washington State Newborn Screening
Laboratory, and 10 previously diagnosed NCL II patients (Figure 4). Unaffected newborns showed a range of activities
from 34 to 87 μmol h–1 L–1 with an average of 58 μmol h–1 L–1. NCL II patients (TPP1 deficiency) displayed a range between 0.02
to 0.8 μmol h–1 L–1 and
an average of 0.3 μmol h–1 L–1, all for blank corrected data. Blanks were carried out by combining
all the components of the assay but replacing the DBS with a filter
paper punch. The sample mean/blank ratios were >60 and the blanks
showed 14% CV. The assays showed a clear distinction between NCL II
affected patients and healthy newborns. TPP1 assay precision was calculated
using a DBS from a control sample. The intra-assay CV was 1.4% (n = 5) involving five injections of the sample from the
incubation of a single blood spot. The interassay CV was 8.7% when
based on 15 injections from different blood spots from the same individual.

assays.

Duplex Analysis
The PPT1 and TPP1 assays were combined
in a single injection for tandem mass spectrometry SRM analysis with
the goal of speeding up data acquisition and increasing sample throughput.
Due to different assay pH conditions and workup procedures, the assays
could not be run as single DBS incubations, but rather samples from
each assay were combined after workup. The results of this duplex
assay of 40 random samples are presented in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), and the data are compiled
in Table S3 (Supporting Information) In
the duplex format, random samples showed PPT1 activities in the range
of 81 to 268 μmol h–1 L–1 with a mean activity of 156 μmol h–1 L–1. These results were comparable to the data from the
above-described simplex PPT1 assay. The five infantile NCL-affected
newborns had a range of activity of 14–40 μmol h–1 L–1, with a mean at 29 μmol
h–1 L–1. The PPT1 activity of
the five late infantile NCL II affected newborns (TPP1 deficiency)
ranged between 30 and 82 μmol h–1 L–1, with an average activity of 61 mmol h–1 L–1. This was lower than the mean activity for random
TPP1 samples, but within the normal range. Blanks were evaluated for
the duplex assay to produce PPT1 activities of 13 to 15 mmol h–1 L–1 with a mean of 14 mmol h–1 L–1.

Duplex data from incubation
of TPP1 activity in 40 random samples gave a range of activities of
40 to 106 μmol h–1 L–1 with
a mean activity of 63 μmol h–1 L–1 (Figure S10 and Table S4, Supporting Information) These values are comparable to those from simplex assay measurements
with a different set of 54 random samples (see above). TPP1 activity
of five NCL II (TPP1 deficiency) affected newborns ranged between
2.6 and 2.8 μmol h–1 L–1 with an average activity of 2.7 μmol h–1 L–1, which dropped to 0.2 μmol h–1 L–1 after blank correction. The TPP1 activity
for the affected individuals from the duplex assay were very similar
to those from the simplex assay. The TPP1 activities of the five infantile
NCL1 affected newborns with diagnosed PPT1 deficiency had a mean of
27 μmol h–1 L–1, which was
at the low end but still within the normal range for random samples.

Discussion
The new substrates showed robust performance
in PPT1 and TPP1 assays
based on tandem mass spectrometric activity measurements. Compared
to fluorometric assays,17 the new protocols
do not require enzyme extraction from the DBS nor chloroform extraction
of the PPT1 substrate, which may be problematic in a clinical laboratory.
Enzymatic product formation from the new substrates was several times
higher than that reported for the fluorometric assays.17 For example, a 46 h incubation of the fluorometric
PPT1 substrate was reported to produce, on average, 0.82 nmol of product
per DBS.17 Our new PPT1 substrate was shown
to produce on average 4.7 nmol of product per DBS after 10 h of incubation.
The fluorometric TPP1 substrate was reported to produce, on average,
0.27 nmol of product per DBS after 46 h of incubation.17 This is to be compared with 1.7 nmol/DBS produced
from our new substrate after 10 h of incubation. These product quantities,
when combined with efficient liquid–liquid or solid-phase extraction
procedures, provide high ion counts in the mass spectrometric analysis
by SRM.

The lower activities measured in samples from the cross-affected
children are most likely due to partial deterioration of the enzymes
in the DBSs.25 Whereas the DBSs from random
newborns were less than 6 months old and were stored at low temperatures;24 the much rarer samples from the affected children
had been collected over several years and were stored at room temperature.
We observed a 15% decrease of TPP1 activity in a 6-month old DBS that
was stored for an additional 12 months at 4 °C. A more systematic
study of DBS aging carried out with multiple samples would be necessary
to address this issue before the PPT1 and TPP1 activity assays are
used for large-scale screening.13,25

Conclusions
The
results reported here illustrate the power of tandem mass spectrometry
in performing enzyme assays in dried blood spots from human subjects
using synthetic compounds that closely mimic natural substrates. Using
this approach, it is possible to increase enzymatic product formation
in the DBS to facilitate accurate quantitation of enzyme activity.
Through careful design of enzyme substrates and internal standards
for human palmitoyl protein thioesterase and tripeptidyl peptidase,
the analytical procedures for the detection of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses
can be multiplexed with each other and potentially also with the previously
developed methods of detecting lysosomal enzyme deficiencies.
