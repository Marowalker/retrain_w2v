A biosensor
for the detection of hepatitis B antibodies in clinical
saliva was developed. Compared to conventional analysis of blood serum,
it offers the advantage of noninvasive collection of samples. Detection
of biomarkers in saliva imposes two major challenges associated with
the low analyte concentration and increased surface fouling. The detection
of minute amounts of hepatitis B antibodies was performed by plasmonically
amplified fluorescence sandwich immunoassay. To have access to specific
detection, we prevented the nonspecific adsorption of biomolecules
present in saliva by brushes of poly[(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)
methacrylamide)-co-(carboxybetaine methacrylamide)]
grafted from the gold sensor surface and post modified with hepatitis
B surface antigen. Obtained results were validated against the response
measured with ELISA at a certified laboratory using serum from the
same patients.

==== Body
Analytical tests that become
available for detection of a broad spectrum of molecular biomarkers
in blood plasma or serum provide a powerful tool for diagnosis of
diseases. However, the invasive nature of blood collection complicates
the analysis for special populations (e.g., elderly people, small
children) and in situations when blood sampling is not possible or
patients impose high risk of infection. Noninvasive sample collection
holds potential to solve this problem, bring the analysis closer to
the patient, and set the basis for point-of-care analysis with increased
frequency of individual tests, thus enhancing the chances for early
diagnosis.

The use of easily accessible bodily fluids, in particular
the use
of saliva, is an attractive alternative to blood as a large number
of disease biomarkers are also present in this fluid and its collection
is inexpensive, completely noninvasive, and minimally disturbing for
the patient.1 Saliva is a complex fluid
containing a variety of glycoproteins, antibodies, growth factors,
carbohydrates, salts, hormones, mucus, and bacteria that leach from
blood by passive, as well as active transport.2 In the past, saliva had already been used to monitor oral health
and periodontal diseases.3 With the advance
of modern biochemical techniques more biomarkers for systemic diseases
were identified in saliva.4

Specific
antibodies against epitopes displayed on the capside of
the hepatitis B virus (hepatitis
B surface antigen-HBsAg) are secreted to blood upon infection or vaccination.
The evaluation of the presence of antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs)
in serum allows confirming the recovery and immunity in patients,
as well as checking for the efficiency of vaccination.5 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause potentially life-threatening
diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or even liver cancer,
and therefore, it represents one of the major global health threats.
Especially in African countries, HBV is highly prevalent and causes
rising infections6 that are associated
with about 0.8 million deaths every year related to hepatitis B.7 HBV can be easily transmitted by the contact
with infected blood or body fluids.8

The use of saliva as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of biomarkers
actively or passively transferred from blood (such as anti-HBs) is
challenging as they are typically present at concentrations several
orders of magnitude lower than in plasma, and thus it requires platforms
with substantially enhanced sensitivity.9−11 Plasmonics has recently
emerged as new nanophotonics research field that provides sensitive
means for direct label-free detection of biomarkers.12 In addition, plasmonics increasingly finds its application
for the amplification of weak optical signals in optical spectroscopy-based
analytical techniques.13 Among these, plasmonic
amplification of fluorescence paved new ways for advancing single
molecule studies.14 In addition, it has
been increasingly applied in optical systems that employ fluorescence
readout of assays relying on ensembles of fluorophores coupled with
biomolecules.15,16 The plasmon-enhanced fluorescence
(PEF) that is also referred to as metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF)
exploits the extremely strong electromagnetic field intensity that
occurs upon the resonant excitation of surface plasmons (SPs) at metallic
nanostructures and on thin metal films. This phenomenon originates
from collective oscillations of electron density at these structures
and they enable increasing the intensity of emitted fluorescence light
from emitters in their close proximity. When fluorophores are used
as labels in immunoassays, their coupling with SPs enhances the fluorescence
light intensity extracted from the surface where the assay takes place.
This type of amplification thus allows resolving lower amount of captured
target molecules and concomitantly improving the limit of detection
of an assay.

In spite of high sensitivity of plasmonic biosensors
that enable
reaching limit of detection < fM concentrations,12 we witnessed limited success in translation of these systems
to clinical praxis. For example, several hepatitis plasmonic biosensor
system utilizing label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection
of binding induced refractive index changes were developed.17,18 However, these biosensors were typically applied only for the analysis
of model samples such as spiked buffer or pooled diluted serum. Arguably,
the key problem in the analysis of clinically relevant samples by
plasmonic biosensors is the fouling of their metallic surface with
tethered ligands for specific capture of target analyte.19,20 To solve this problem, research in surface chemistries and architectures
was pursued to decrease or completely eliminate the adverse effect
of fouling and thereby maximize the efficiency. The most widely used
surface modifications are based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), for
example, self-assembled monolayers (SAM) terminated with short oligoethylene
glycol (OEG). While this approach is able to completely eliminate
the nonspecific adsorption of albumin, it fails when complex samples
(such as blood plasma/serum and saliva) are analyzed.21,22

In this work, a biosensor for the noninvasive analysis of
anti-HBs
antibodies in clinical saliva samples is presented. It takes advantage
of highly sensitive plasmon-enhanced fluorescence readout and novel
antifouling poly[(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide)-co-(carboxybetaine methacrylamide)] (poly[HPMA-co-CBMAA]) polymer brush. This recently developed brush retains its
properties even after the immobilization of large surface mass density
of ligands.23 This combination addresses
the two key challenges in the biomarker analysis in saliva that are
associated with extremely low analyte concentration and severe unspecific
interactions with the biosensor surface.

Experimental Section
Materials
1-Ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. 1,4,8,11-Tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane
(Me4Cyclam, 98%), CuCl (≥99.995%), and CuCl2 (99.999%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. HBsAg antigen
(recombinant, adw subtype) and monoclonal mouse antihepatitis B virus
surface antigen antibodies (anti-HBs) were purchased from Hytest (Turku,
Finland). Secondary antibodies against mouse antibody (Alexa Fluor
647 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)), and against the human antibodies (Alexa
Fluor 647 Goat Anti-Human IgG (H+L)) were purchased from Molecular
Probes (Eugene, OR, US). Initiator ω-mercaptoundecyl bromoisobutyrate
was synthesized according to the literature procedure.24 The monomers (3-acryloylaminopropyl)-(2-carboxyethyl)
dimethylammonium (carboxybetaine methacrylamide, CBMAA) and N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) were synthesized
according to the literature.25−27 The buffers used were phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 2 mM potassium
phosphate, 137 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, pH 7.4),
HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5), and sodium acetate buffer (SA, 10 mM,
pH 5).

Biological Samples
Saliva samples were collected from
eight healthy donors who were either vaccinated or not-vaccinated
against Hepatitis B. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16000g and the supernatant was aliquoted. Saliva aliquots were
stored at −80 °C before analysis. The donors did not consume
food nor liquids for 30 min prior to collecting of samples. The titer
of anti-HBs antibodies in serum was tested using enzyme-linked immunoassays
(ELISA) done in CE certified laboratory Labors, in Vienna (Austria).
The serum was collected from the same donors and at the same time
as saliva.

Preparation of Sensor Chips
BK7
glass slides with 2
nm chromium and 50 nm gold films were prepared by high vacuum evaporation.
The surface of gold was subsequently rinsed with ethanol and deionized
water, dried and cleaned with ozone for 20 min (UVO cleaner, Jelight).
Afterward, the gold surface was overnight incubated in a 1 mM solution
of ω-mercaptoundecyl bromoisobutyrate in ethanol. This compound
served as an initiator in the synthesis of poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) brushes as described in more detail in our previous work.23 Briefly, for the catalyst solution, 7 mL degassed
methanol were transferred (under argon atmosphere) into a Schlenk
tube with 354 μmol (35 mg) of CuCl, 78 μmol (10.5 mg)
of CuCl2, and 472 μmol (121 mg) of Me4Cyclam and stirred until complete dissolution. A second Schlenk tube,
at 0 °C, contained 16.6 mg (2.4 g) of HPMA and 2.9 mmol (0.7
g) of CBMAA dissolved in 12 mL of degassed water and 5 mL of deoxygenated
methanol. The catalyst solution was added using a gastight syringe.
Polymerization on the substrates with the initiator SAM was done at
30 °C for 2 h. Samples were washed thoroughly and stored in water
until usage.

Immobilization of HBsAg
The antigen
HBsAg was immobilized
to the brushes via the carboxylate groups carried by CBMAA that were
previously activated using the EDC/NHS. First, the brush surface was
contacted with SA buffer pH 5. Subsequently, the surface was reacted
with a freshly prepared solution 1:1 v/v of EDC (0.4 M) and NHS (0.1
M) for 10 min. Then the surface was rinsed with SA and HEPES buffers
for 1 min each and the antigen, HBsAg (25 μg·mL–1 in HEPES buffer), was flowed over the surface for up to 10 min.
Any unreacted active ester groups were let to hydrolyze by flowing
PBS for 90 min.

Optical Setup
The time-resolved
readout of sandwich
assay on the sensor chip was performed by using a setup depicted in Figure 1. It combines angular
interrogation of SPR with plasmonically amplified fluorescence detection.

Figure 1 Schematics
of plasmon-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy biosensor
with a detail of sensor chip with poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA)
brush functioning as a binding matrix.

Monochromatic beam with transverse magnetic polarization
and a
wavelength of λex = 633 nm was used to excite SPs
on the sensor surface. Intensity of the excitation beam was attenuated
to 1.5 μW and it was coupled to a 90° prism made of LASFN9
glass. To the prism base, a sensor chip with gold layer modified by
poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) brushes was optically matched
by using an immersion oil (from Cargille Inc., USA). A transparent
flow-cell (volume 10 μL) was clamped to flow analyzed samples
over the surface of the sensor chip at flow rate of 15 μL·min–1 by using a peristaltic pump. The angle of incidence
of the excitation beam was adjusted to around θ≈60°
at which the resonant coupling to SPs at the interface between gold
and polymer brushes occurs. The enhanced field intensity of SPs at
λex excited fluorophore labels on the sensor surface
and the fluorescence light emitted at longer wavelength of λem through the flow cell was collected by a lens with numerical
aperture 0.2. The fluorescence beam was focused at the input of a
photomultiplier that was connected to a counter. The output fluorescence
intensity was recorded in time by using software Wasplas developed
at Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz (Germany). The
fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 and respective filters were used for the
excitation wavelength of λex = 633 nm and emission
wavelength of λem = 670 nm. Band pass filter FL632.8–10
from Thorlabs (UK) was employed to select the excitation wavelength
λex and band-pass filter 670FS10–25 from L.O.T.-Oriel
(Germany) and notch filter XNF-632.8–25.0 M from CVI Melles
Griot (Germany) were installed for collecting light at emission wavelength
λem. All measurements were carried out at room temperature T ≈ 25 °C.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of Brushes Architecture
Polymer brushes
of poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) were successfully
grown from a densely packed SAM of ω-mercaptoundecyl bromoisobutyrate
on Au via surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP)
as described and characterized in detail before.23 The thickness of the brushes was determined by ellispometry
in dry state hdry = 29.2 ± 2.3 nm
and when hydrated in water hsw = 81.5
± 1.7 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform
infrared grazing angle specular reflectance spectroscopy were utilized
to prove the chemical structure of the brushes. The core level C 1s
spectrum (Figure 2 a)
of the brushes is characterized by C–C, C–H (285.0 eV), C*–C(=O)–
from the secondary chemical shifts induced to the carbon atoms in
the vicinity to amide and charged carboxylic groups (285.5 eV), C–N (286.1 eV), C–OH
(286.9 eV), C(=O)–NH (288.0 eV),
and C(=O)–O– carboxylate (288.7 eV). The high resolution N 1s spectrum of the
brushes (Figure 2 b)
is characterized by a prevailing amide contribution (400.1 eV) and
a contribution characteristic for the charged quaternary ammonium
of the CBMAA comonomer (403.0 eV). The O 1s spectrum is presented
in the SI. Further evidence of the chemical
composition of the brushes was obtained by FTIR GASR. Figure 2 c depicts the spectrum of
poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) brushes which exhibits both a
band at 1376 cm–1 and a shoulder band at 1610 cm–1 corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching
modes of COO– stemming from CBMAA as well as it
shows the amide I and amide II bands at 1527 and 1653 cm–1 originating from the HPMA. The morphology of the surface of the
brushes was observed using an AFM microscope which can be found in
the SI. The functionalization of the gold-coated
sensors rendered the surface more hydrophilic as evidenced by the
dynamic contact angles of θadv = 34 ± 0.5°;
θrec = 15.3 ± 3.3.

Selection of an adequate
biofunctionalization procedure is of great
importance to achieve high loading of immobilized ligands. In particular,
the pH of buffer plays a key role as discussed detail in SI. First, carboxylate groups are converted to
succinimidyl ester in water and rinsed with SA. The pH of SA buffer
(pH 5) is preferred due to the lower rate of hydrolysis of succinimidyl
ester compared to alkaline solutions.28 After the activation of carboxylate groups (negatively charged)
of CBMAA to form succinimidyl ester (neutral), using EDC/NHS, the
surface becomes positively charged (stemming from quaternary ammonium
groups). Therefore, by using a buffer with a pH above the isoelelectric
point of the chosen ligand (HBsAg with pI ∼4.5)29 this protein exhibits negative charge and is
attracted to the surface by Coulombic force which leads to a higher
yield in the immobilization on the brush. After the subsequent rinsing
with buffer, the unreacted active esters hydrolyze back to carboxylate
groups and the (close to) neutral net charge of the polymer brush
is restored. The loading of HBsAg on the brushes was controlled by
the reaction time and the herein used chips carried the surface mass
density of HBsAg of ΔΓ = 0.52 ± 0.03 μg·cm–2 as determined by SPR measurements. This value corresponds
to about a monolayer as was reported for proteins exhibiting similar
molecular weight.30 Comparable surface
mass density has been shown previously for SAM-based architectures,
however, the resistance to fouling was largely impaired.31

The resistance of the poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) brush
to the fouling was evaluated for saliva samples collected from healthy
individuals. Since the immobilization of bioreceptors may change the
antifouling properties, the fouling of brushes functionalized with
HBsAg was evaluated for samples from individuals that showed negative
response in the ELISA serum test. As illustrated by SPR sensorgrams
in Figure 3, the surface
mass density change upon 10 min flow of saliva samples over the sensor
surface with and without HBsAg was measured. The protein deposition
from undiluted 100% saliva and samples with 10% saliva diluted by
PBS was not measurable on pristine poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA)
brushes, see Figure 3a and Figure 3b.

Figure 3 SPR characterization
of the fouling on pristine and functionalized
poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) brush: (a) Pristine surface in
contact with 100% saliva, (b) pristine surface in contact with 10%
saliva, and (c) surface modified with HBsAg in contact with 10% saliva.

Importantly, the resistance to
the fouling of poly(HPMA-CBMAA)
brush is retained even after the HBsAg is immobilized with surface
mass density as large as 0.5 μg·cm–2,
see Figure 3c. This
is a key observation as the functionalization of brushes composed
from individual homopolymers (HPMA and CBMAA) is known to severely
deteriorate their antifouling properties.31 This effect can be ascribed to the reaction of too many functional
groups (e.g., carboxyl of CBMAA) leading to a net positive charge
or cross-linking of the chains. The herein reported approach enables
efficient biofunctionalization of the polymer brush because of the
presence of carboxyl groups in CBMAA while preserving antifouling
properties of the polymer brush owing to the HPMA units.

Analysis of
Clinical Saliva Samples
Clinical saliva
samples collected from 8 healthy human donors were used and prepared
as described in the methods section. The total amount of sample needed
for one analysis was only 15 μL. The response of developed plasmonic
biosensor for each saliva sample was compared with the results obtained
by ELISA for serum samples from the same donor. The ELISA analysis
was carried out by an independent certified laboratory (Labors.at,
Vienna, Austria). According to ELISA, the tested saliva samples were
obtained from donors that showed negative response in serum (samples
D, F, H, antibody titer below the detection limit of ELISA 0.002 IU·mL–1), positive response in serum (B, E, G, 0.068–0.645
IU·mL–1) and highly positive response (A, C,
> 1 IU·mL–1).

The SPR detection principle
was tested for the analysis of saliva samples collected from donors
which were known to exhibit highly positive response in serum. These
serum samples were analyzed by using an identical instrument with
the same brush surface architecture.23 While
the direct binding of anti-HBs human IgG could be easily observed
from serum samples, no measurable positive response was obtained from
saliva samples, even after binding of secondary antibody against human
IgG (hIgG). Therefore, the PEF biosensor was used in order to increase
the sensitivity as described further.

The developed PEF assay
is illustrated in Figure 4. First, a stable baseline in fluorescence
signal acquired in time was established upon a flow of PBS over the
surface of HBsAg-functionalized brushes. Then a calibration step was
performed in which PBS spiked with mouse anti-HBs was flowed at 10
pM concentration through the sensor for 10 min. This antibody was
labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 dye and therefore the injection is accompanied
by increased fluorescence signal F. The sensorgram
in Figure 4 shows that
an abrupt change occurs at time t = 10 min due to
the excitation of fluorophores present in the bulk. Between the time t = 10 and 20 min, a gradual increase in the signal occurs
because of the affinity binding to the immobilized antigen HBsAg.
At time t = 20 min the sensor surface is rinsed with
buffer and the fluorescence signal drops to an increased level ΔFcal which is proportional to the amount of affinity
bound anti-HBs molecules.

Figure 4 Example of kinetics of fluorescence signal for
negative and highly
positive saliva samples.

After 5 min rinsing, an analyzed 10% saliva sample was flowed
over
the sensor surface for 10 min. At this time no fluorescence change
is observed as the human hIgG specific to HBsAg are not labeled. To
detect the presence of these antibodies on the surface, the sensor
was rinsed for 5 min with PBS and the antihuman IgG labeled with Alexa
Fluor 647 dye (anti-hIgG, 4 μg·mL–1 in
PBS) was injected. This compound was flowed for 10 min between t = 40 and 50 min. Similarly as in the calibration step,
the fluorescence signal rapidly increased upon the injection and then
gradually rose due to the affinity binding to captured hIgG. An additional
rinsing with PBS for 5 min was applied and the difference in the fluorescence
intensity ΔF before and after the flow of detection
anti-hIgG was determined. In order to compensate for small changes
in the alignment, the sensor response was defined as a ratio ΔF/ΔFcal.

Figure 5a compares
the obtained normalized fluorescence response ΔF/Fcal for saliva samples with values
determined by ELISA for serum. The PEF saliva analysis was performed
in triplicate for each sample and showed error bars represent the
standard deviation (SD) of measured values. The average SD associated
with chip-to-chip variations of the PEF assay output is 26% of the
mean value of fluorescence response ΔF/Fcal. This relatively high error can be partially
ascribed to the noise in the detected fluorescence signal (as observed
in Figure 4) which
can be improved by using plasmon-enhanced fluorescence schemes with
higher enhancement factor and thus improved signal-to-noise ratio.32,33 In addition, the reproducibility of the assay that involves multiple
manually performed steps including saliva centrifugation, dilution
of supernatant with buffer, sensor calibration with labeled mouse
IgG, and sequential flow of saliva sample and labeled antihuman IgG
may be improved by using automatized flow injection system. The plotted
dependence of PEF saliva response on respective ELISA serum response
in Figure 5b shows
that it can be fitted with a linear function (r-square
value of 0.89, the ELISA response is presented in log scale on the
horizontal axis). In this graph, the response for samples collected
from negative donors (H, F, D) and highly positive donors (A, C) was
averaged. The results of PEF analysis of saliva samples indicate that
highly positive saliva samples (average fluorescence response of 1.87,
SD = 0.3) can be reliably discriminated from negative samples (average
fluorescence response of 0.33, SD = 0.1). Interestingly, the PEF response
to saliva samples is not proportional to that acquired by ELISA for
serum samples as the slope of the respective dependence in a log–log
representation substantially differs from 1 (is of about 0.3). Therefore,
such dependence in conjunction with relatively high error bars does
not allow for accurate quantitative measurements in the range between
0.01 and 1 IU·mL–1. The reason for such deviations
may be attributed to different composition of saliva compared to serum
which may affect the assay. In addition, we assume that the hIgG antibodies
present in saliva and serum can bind to HBsAg with a range of affinity
constants. As in ELISA the immobilized antigen is typically incubated
for much longer time (hours) compared to the presented PEF sensor
(10 min), the lower affinity fraction of hIgG against HBsAg may not
be detected by the PEF biosensor while in ELISA it can contribute
to the sensor signal.

samples

of respective serum samples. (b) Overview of PEF sensor response as
a function of concentration in serum as determined by ELISA. Indicated

value of 0.89.

Conclusions
We
report for the first time the successful implementation of a
plasmonic biosensor for the analysis of human IgG against hepatitis
B surface antigen in clinical saliva samples. The work pursued enhanced
specificity and sensitivity to analyze minute amounts of biomarkers
in the complex saliva matrix. This was achieved by the design of a
novel antifouling biointerface architecture based on poly(HPMA-co-CBMAA) brushes in combination with surface plasmon-enhanced
fluorescence detection principle. It is worth of noting that regular
SPR biosensor with identical surface architecture and assay did not
show measurable signal for analyzed clinical saliva samples and made
the use of plasmonically enhanced fluorescence detection principle
necessary. The biosensor showed excellent resistance to fouling from
saliva samples and allowed distinguishing of highly positive clinical
saliva samples (respective serum ELISA response >1 IU/mL) and negative
clinical saliva samples (respective serum ELISA response <0.01
IU/mL). It is envisioned that the achieved results will pave the way
to new class of biosensor technologies that can be deployed outside
centralized laboratories and which take advantage of the analysis
of bodily fluids that are collected completely noninvasively. In conjunction
with miniaturized PEF readers34 and more
sensitive plasmonic architectures32,33 the presented
approach is among others expected to find its applications in clinical
practices for diagnosis and measuring of the antibody titers.
