Despite years of
research, the glycome of the model nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans is still not fully understood.
Certainly, data over the years have indicated that this organism synthesizes
unusual N-glycans with a range of galactose and fucose modifications
on the Man2–3GlcNAc2 core region. Previously,
up to four fucose residues were detected on its N-glycans, despite
these lacking the fucosylated antennae typical of many other eukaryotes;
some of these fucose residues are capped with hexose residues as shown
by the studies of us and others. There have, though, been contrasting
reports regarding the maximal number of fucose substitutions in C. elegans, which in part may be due to different
methodological approaches, including use of either peptide:N-glycosidases
F and A (PNGase F and A) or anhydrous hydrazine to cleave the N-glycans
from glycopeptides. Here we compare the use of hydrazine with that
of a new enzyme (rice PNGase Ar) and show that both enable release
of glycans with more sugar residues on the proximal GlcNAc than previously
resolved. By use of exoglycosidase sequencing, in conjunction with
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS/MS), we now reveal that actually up to five fucose residues
modify the core region of C. elegans N-glycans and that the α1,3-fucose on the reducing terminus
can be substituted by an α-linked galactose. Thus, traditional
PNGase F and A release may be insufficient for release of the more
highly core-modified N-glycans, especially those occurring in C. elegans, but novel enzymes can compete against
chemical methods in terms of safety, ease of cleanup, and quality
of resulting glycomic data.

==== Body
Caenorhabditis
elegans is a widely
used genetically tractable experimental model for, e.g., development
and aging biology research and was the first multicellular organism
whose genome was sequenced.1 As a nonparasitic
nematode, it is also suitable for comparisons with parasitic species
of the same phylum. However, C. elegans continues to surprise glycobiologists in terms of its glycome; advances
in methodology and the use of mutant strains over the past 15 years
of N-glycan analyses have resulted in complex data sets and sometimes
contradictory interpretations from different research groups.2 Early on, it was clear that C.
elegans has an unparalleled fucosylation machinery,
and up to four fucose residues were proposed to be present on its
N-glycans with compositions such as Hex5–8HexNAc2Fuc3 or Hex5–7HexNAc2Fuc4Me0–1;3−7 furthermore, over 20 possible fucosyltransferase homologues are
encoded by its genome, of which only a few are enzymatically characterized
and proven to be able to fucosylate N-glycan structures.6,8−12 In terms of N-glycans, the roles of two α1,3-fucosyltransferases
(FUT-1 and FUT-6) and one α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT-8) have
been defined by us on the basis of analyses of the recombinant enzymes
and of the glycomes of the corresponding single, double, and triple fut-1, fut-6, and fut-8 knockout mutants.13,14

Nevertheless, there remain open questions. On one hand, the
glycomic
studies on mutants revealed five positions for fucosylation, even
though only maximally four fucoses were present on any verified structure.
On the other, the maximal degree of galactosylation of these C. elegans N-glycans is unclear, despite the recent
detection of bisecting galactose on the β1,4-mannose13 as well as the more established “GalFuc”
6-linked modification of the reducing-terminal (proximal) GlcNAc15 and a more unusual GalFuc 3-linked to the distal
GlcNAc.16 In one study in which hydrazine
was employed, the presence of a hexose (assumed to be β1,4-linked
galactose) on the proximal 3-linked core fucose was proposed.7

Hydrazinolysis has been used for some decades
for release of glycans,17,18 but is also associated
with safety issues as well as artifacts.
As hydrazine cleaves amide bonds, it not only will destroy peptide
and N-glycosidic bonds, but also deacetylates GlcNAc, GalNAc, and
neuraminic acids which must be re-N-acetylated (thus affecting the
glycan structure in the case of, e.g., N-glycolylneuraminic
acid) and may cause some “peeling” of the N-glycan core.19 Other chemical methods, e.g., under alkaline
conditions,20 have not gained wide acceptance
for N-glycomic studies. On the other hand, enzymatic release can be
dependent on glycopeptide length and the specificity of the required
peptide:N-glycosidases (PNGases; 3.5.1.52).21,22 However, some newly discovered enzymes have a wider substrate specificity
in terms of cleaving core α1,3-fucosylated glycans from even
intact proteins.23−25 Here we have compared the use of hydrazine with an
enzyme of plant origin (PNGase Ar, a commercially available recombinant
form of rice vacuolar PNGase) and show not only that there is an α-linked
galactose attached to the core α1,3-fucose on a subset of C. elegans N-glycans but that pentafucosylated structures
also exist in this organism with “maximal” compositions
of Hex7HexNAc2Fuc4–5Me1–2. Thus, new enzymes have the promise of replacing
chemical methods for safe and effective release of N-glycans with
complex core modifications.

Methods
Biological Material
Wild-type C. elegans (N2) was obtained
from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC),
University of Minnesota, U.S.A. The fut-1;fut-8 and fut-6;fut-8 strains (lacking either the proximal core α1,3-
and α1,6-fucose residues or the distal α1,3- and proximal
α1,6-fucose) were previously prepared as described.14C. elegans were
grown in liquid culture with Escherichia coli OP50 in standard S complete medium; mixed stages were harvested
after cultivation at 20 °C (160 rpm) for 4–6 days and
purified by sucrose density centrifugation.26,27 Harvested worms were boiled, homogenized, and treated with either
pepsin (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C or thermolysin (Promega) for
2 h at 70 °C.28 Glycopeptides were
purified by cation-exchange chromatography (Dowex 50WX8) followed
by gel filtration (Sephadex G25); for further details refer to the Supporting Information.

N-Glycan Release, Purification,
and Labeling
Enzymatic
release of N-glycans from worm peptic glycopeptides was done using
three different peptide:N-glycosidases: (i) recombinant bacterial
PNGase F (from Flavobacterium [Elizabethkingia] meningosepticum, Roche; at pH 8.0), (ii) native almond PNGase A (from Prunus amygdalus, Roche; at pH 5.0), and (iii) recombinant
rice PNGase Ar (from Oryza sativa expressed
in Pichia pastoris and Endo H treated,
New England Biolabs; also at pH 5.0). In the first experiments, digestion
was either by PNGase F followed by PNGase A, and then PNGase Ar, or
PNGase A followed by PNGase Ar of peptic peptides. In another experiment,
thermolysin was used for proteolysis prior to two rounds of PNGase
Ar. For chemical release, peptic glycopeptides were incubated with
anhydrous hydrazine at 100 °C for 5 h. After centrifugal evaporation,
the glycans were re-N-acetylated and treated with 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic
acid in order to liberate the reducing end.29 Note that hydrazine is a hazardous reagent and must only be used
when applying relevant safety procedures.

After either enzymatic
or chemical release, N-glycan pools resulting from the final round
of Dowex 50WX8 chromatography were separately purified by solid-phase
extraction using nonporous graphitized carbon (nPGC; elution with
40% acetonitrile) and LiChroprep RP-18 (C18; elution with water) prior
to pyridylamination as previously described.28,30 In case of glycans released by two rounds of PNGase Ar digestion,
solely C18 purification was performed after Dowex chromatography prior
to pyridylamination. For a flowchart as well as further details, refer
to the scheme and extended methods in the Supporting Information.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis
The
N-glycomes of the different
glycan preparations were profiled by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Autoflex
Speed, Bruker Daltonics, Germany) in positive-ion mode using FlexControl
3.4 software. 2-Aminopyridine (PA)-labeled N-glycans were fractionated
by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC),
also in combination with a hydrophilic interaction column (see below),28 and all collected HPLC peaks were also examined
by MALDI-TOF MS, using 6-aza-2-thiothymine (ATT) as matrix; tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to confirm the composition of all proposed
structures was performed by laser-induced dissociation (precursor
ion selector was generally set to ±0.6%). The detector voltage
was generally set at 1977–2260 V for MS and 2133–2714
V for MS/MS; 1000–3000 shots from different regions of the
sample spots were summed. Spectra were processed with the manufacturer’s
software (Bruker Flexanalysis 3.3.80) using the SNAP algorithm with
a signal-to-noise threshold of 6 for MS (unsmoothed) and 3 for MS/MS
(4-times smoothed). In total approximately 2500 MS and MS/MS spectra
were manually interpreted on the basis of the mass, fragmentation
pattern, and results of chemical and enzymatic treatments; isomeric
structures present in different RP-HPLC or 2D-HPLC fractions were
defined on the basis of comparisons of the aforementioned parameters.
At least five MS/MS fragment ions, including Y-type and B-type ions,
were used to aid definition of each structure. Three selected HPLC-purified
N-glycans were subject to LC–MSn as previously described using a 5 μm porous graphitized carbon
column and an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) in
negative-ion mode14 with the spectral interpretation
being performed in comparison to the literature.31

HPLC Purification of N-Glycans
Separation
of PA-labeled
glycans was carried out on a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with a
fluorescence detector. In case of RP-HPLC, a Hypersil ODS column (C18;
Agilent) was used with 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, and 30% (v/v)
methanol; a gradient of the latter (1% per minute) was programmed.
The column was calibrated daily in terms of glucose units (g.u.) with
a pyridylaminated partial dextran hydrolysate. For 2D-HPLC, selected
fractions were reapplied to a combined hydrophilic-interaction anionic-exchange
HPLC (HIAX, Dionex IonPac AS11) with an inverse gradient of acetonitrile
in 800 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3.85, as previously described.32 For further details refer to the Supporting Information.

Structural Elucidation
Using Exoglycosidases and Chemical Treatment
In general,
a 1 μL aliquot of an HPLC fraction was mixed
with 0.2 μL of exoglycosidase and 0.8 μL of 100 mM ammonium
acetate solution, pH 5.0, and incubated overnight. Exoglycosidases
employed were: α-galactosidase from green coffee beans (Sigma),
β-galactosidase from either Aspergillus niger(33) (recombinant, produced in-house) or Aspergillus oryzae (native; Sigma), jack bean α-mannosidase
(Sigma), recombinant Xanthomonas manihotis α1,2/3-mannosidase34 (New England
Biolabs), and α-L-fucosidase from bovine kidney (Sigma). For
removal of α1,2/3-linked fucose or methylfucose, glycan samples
were dried in a SpeedVac, and then incubated with 3 μL of 48%
(w/v) hydrofluoric acid (HF) on ice for 24 h. The HF was immediately
removed in a SpeedVac. Chemically or enzymatically treated glycans
were generally reanalyzed, unless otherwise stated, by MALDI-TOF MS
and MS/MS without further purification. For further details refer
to the Supporting Information.

Results
and Discussion
Comparison of Chemical and Enzymatic N-Glycan
Release
In order to resolve the contrasting data regarding
the maximal degree
of core modification of N-glycans in C. elegans, especially whether only chemical release is suitable for isolation
of structures carrying a 3-linked HexFuc element,7 we compared the results obtained after hydrazinolysis with
those with different PNGases, including a new commercially available
plant-derived enzyme (here named PNGase Ar). Typically, to release
nematode N-glycans, we and others have serially digested with Flavobacterium PNGase F and almond PNGase A or just
used PNGase A alone,4,29,35,36 whereas hydrazinolysis has been used relatively
rarely for “worm” samples.7,29,37 There are also differences in procedures prior to
glycan release, with either trypsin or pepsin being commonly used
to prepare glycopeptides; recently, we have begun to adopt thermolysin
to proteolyze samples prior to PNGase treatment,28 as the proteolysis step is at neutral pH and is more rapid.

In this study, the following glycan release protocols were performed:
(i) PNGase F, PNGase A, and PNGase Ar, (ii) PNGase A and PNGase Ar,
(iii) two rounds of PNGase Ar, or (iv) with hydrazine. The N-glycans
were then subject to pyridylamination, RP-HPLC (Supplementary Figure 1), and MALDI-TOF MS. The most complex
RP-HPLC profiles were those resulting after release with hydrazine
or with PNGase Ar alone, while those chromatograms obtained after
use of either PNGases F or A are overall apparently simpler; the major
peaks in these four cases are of 4.4, 4.7, 7.0–7.2, and 11.2
g.u. On the basis of MALDI-TOF MS of the individual fractions, oligomannosidic
(Man8,9GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 4.4, 4.7, and 7.0 g.u.) and paucimannosidic glycans (Man3GlcNAc2Fuc0–1; 7.2 and 11.2 g.u.,
with and without core α1,6-fucose) dominate the profile after
use of PNGase F, an enzyme which cannot cleave glycans with a core
α1,3-fucose.22 The glycans released
by PNGase A or PNGase Ar included, e.g., standard core di-α1,3/α1,6-fucosylated
paucimannosidic structures eluting at 6–8 g.u. as well as earlier-eluting
galactosylated forms thereof; all pools contained some phosphorylcholine-modified
glycans which are not further discussed here, as the focus is on the
galactose-containing fucosylated structures, whose bulky 3D conformation
probably influences the ability to release them.

Hydrazine and
PNGase Ar Released Glycans with a Novel α-Galactose
Residue
When considering the hydrazine-released glycans,
we focused on those which presented previously unobserved elution
and fragmentation properties. In former studies on wild-type nematode
glycomes, we have observed Y-fragments (derived from the pyridylaminated
core) such as m/z 446, 592, 608,
and 754 (Fuc1–2Hex0–1GlcNAc1–PA29,35), whereas MALDI-TOF MS screening
of each RP-HPLC fraction of the hydrazine-released pool indicated
the presence of fragment ions at m/z 916 for glycans eluting at 4.4 and 4.7 g.u. (Figure 1); this would correspond to a core of Fuc2Hex2GlcNAc1–PA. Typically, the
MS/MS spectra with such a fragment also contained ions at m/z 754 (minor), 608 (relatively intense),
and 446 (minor) suggesting that each core fucose on the reducing-terminal
GlcNAc (both the α1,3- and α1,6-linked) was modified by
a hexose, considering also that the core α1,3-fucose is usually
more labile in MS/MS. To investigate these structures more exactly,
a number of glycosidase and chemical treatments were performed. Three
galactosidases (coffee bean α- and two Aspergillus β-specific) as well as bovine α-fucosidase were used
in addition to hydrofluoric acid, and shifts in MS and MS/MS profiles
were assessed.

Figure 1 Detection of novel core diagnostic fragments in wild-type C. elegans N-glycans. N-Glycans released by hydrazinolysis
from the N2 wild-type C. elegans were
PA-labeled and separated on RP-HPLC (A); collected fractions were
subject to MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS analyses in positive-ion mode. In
two neighboring fractions, eluting around 4.4–4.7 glucose units
(g.u.), in addition to the oligomannosidic Man8B and Man9 structures
of m/z 1799 and 1961, five fucosylated
N-glycans with compositions of Hex6–7HexNAc2Fuc2–3Me0–1 (m/z 1767, 1913, 1927, 1929, and 2075 as [M + H]+) were identified. (B). Fragmentation of these glycans yielded
novel core Y-fragment ions at m/z 916 (Hex2dHex2GlcNAc–PA), indicative
of an additional modification of the innermost GlcNAc residue (C).
Proposed structures are shown according to the Standard Nomenclature
for Glycans (ref (42)) (circles, mannose or galactose; squares, N-acetylglucosamine;
triangles, fucose with α1,3- and α1,6-linkages being indicated
by the downward or upward orientation). For a comparison with enzymatic
release, refer to Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.

Focusing on the example 4.4 g.u.
fraction containing Hex6HexNAc2Fuc2 (m/z 1767; Figure 2A),
α-galactosidase removed one residue (Figure 2B) and β-galactosidase up to two, i.e.,
the bisecting β1,4-galactose, thus “unblocking”
the α1,3-linked mannose (Figure 2, parts C and E), as well as the β1,4-galactose
capping the α1,6-fucose as shown by the subsequent susceptibility
of the latter to α-fucosidase treatment (Figure 2, parts C and D); both galactosidases resulted
in loss of the m/z 916 MS/MS Y-fragment,
but had different effects on that at m/z 608. Hydrofluoric acid treatment, which can cleave α1,3-fucose
but not α1,6-fucose, resulted in concomitant loss of a fucose
and a hexose fragment and also resulted in loss of the m/z 916 Y-fragment (Figure 2F). Considering the effect of α-galactosidase
on the core fragmentation pattern, it was concluded that an α-galactose
residue is attached to the core α1,3-fucose. Thereby, our α-galactosidase
treatment data is in contrast to the older report in which the substitution
of the α1,3-fucose by β1,4-galactose was proposed.7

Figure 2 Enzymatic and chemical treatments of an RP-HPLC fractionated
hydrazine-released
wild-type N-glycan. The PA-labeled Hex6HexNAc2Fuc2 structure (m/z 1767;
A), on RP-HPLC eluting at 4.4 g.u., was subject to structural characterization
using MALDI-TOF MS/MS in combination with glycosidase and hydrofluoric
acid treatments. Incubation of this glycan with coffee bean α-galactosidase
resulted in a loss of one hexose residue (B), whereas with recombinant A. niger β-galactosidase up to two hexose residues
were removed (C), demonstrating the presence of three galactose residues
(one α-Gal and two β-Gal) on the Hex6HexNAc2Fuc2 structure. Treatments of the structure with
either a mixture of β-galactosidase (β-Gal) and α-fucosidase
(α-Fuc) or a mixture of β-galactosidase (β-Gal)
and α1,2/3-mannosidase (α3-Man) yielded two different
final products, Hex4HexNAc2Fuc1 (m/z 1297, D) and Hex3HexNAc2Fuc2 (m/z 1281,
E). The Hex6HexNAc2Fuc2 glycan was
also sensitive to hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment as judged by the
loss of a 308 unit concluded to be a Galα-Fucα1,3-linked
disaccharide (F). Relevant MS/MS spectra of glycans from parts A–F
are shown in the right panel. Especially, the differential changes
of the core m/z 608 and 916 fragments
upon either β- or α-galactosidase digestion are a clear
indication that the two hexoses modifying the difucosylated GlcNAc
core are, respectively, β-linked to the α1,6-fucose or
α-linked to the α1,3-fucose. Asterisks indicate non-glycan
contaminants with m/z 1522 (in part
A) or, originating from the α-galactosidase, 1296, 1470, and
1499 (in part B); M signifies coeluting mannosidic N-glycans. [M +
H]+ ions are annotated, but sodium adducts (22 mass units
larger) dominate in some spectra (E and F); MS/MS was solely performed
on protonated parent ions.

On the basis of these findings with the chemically released
glycans,
we reappraised enzymatic release from peptides prepared using pepsin
with three different PNGases. As mentioned above, use of these enzymes
in series resulted in distinct RP-HPLC profiles (Supplementary Figure 1). In the 4.4–4.7 g.u. region
for the PNGase Ar-released pools (after prior PNGase A treatment),
glycans of the same mass as in the hydrazine-released pool were detected,
whose MS/MS patterns also displayed the m/z 916 Y-fragment ion (Supplementary Figure 2). In another experiment, we performed two rounds of
PNGase Ar digestion of thermolysin-digested material; in this case
the m/z 916 cores were present in
both rounds but were more obvious after the second treatment with
this enzyme (Supplementary Figure 2, parts C and H). As such glycans were not detected when using PNGase A (either
alone or after PNGase F treatment) or PNGase F, we conclude that only
PNGase Ar can (regardless of the prior proteolysis method) release
the same Fuc2Hex2GlcNAc1 cores as
hydrazine, while these are not cleaved by either PNGase F or A (for
MS of corresponding fractions from each release method, see Supplementary Figure 3).

PNGase Ar Released Glycans
from a Mutant Strain
An
independent means of proving the presence of α-galactose on
the reducing-terminal core α1,3-fucose was to reappraise the
glycome of the fut-6;fut-8 double knockout strain,
in which only the FUT-1 α1,3-fucosyltransferase is capable of
modifying the core chitobiose region, but neither the FUT-6 nor FUT-8
enzymes.14 Thus, any m/z 446 or 608 fragments (Hex0–1HexNAc1Fuc1–PA) can only originate from,
respectively, a free or modified core α1,3-fucose on the proximal
GlcNAc. Use of PNGase Ar to release glycans from this mutant indeed
resulted in detection of glycans with an m/z 608 fragment (Fuc1Hex1GlcNAc1–PA). A set of such glycans, eluting rather early on
RP-HPLC (2.3–2.4 g.u.; Hex4–5GlcNAc2Fuc1–2Me0–1–PA), displayed
sensitivity to either α-galactosidase or hydrofluoric acid,
with both treatments resulting in loss of the m/z 608 MS/MS ion and appearance of ones at m/z 446 or 300 (Figure 3). Treatment with α-galactosidase also
resulted in small shifts in retention time so that one product coeluted
with a previously defined core α1,3-fucosylated structure from
this mutant (Supplementary Figure 4).

Figure 3 Detection
of N-glycans from a mutant strain carrying a GalαFucα1,3
disaccharide unit on the proximal GlcNAc residue. Glycopeptides from
the fut-6;fut-8 double knockout (lacking the distal
α1,3- and proximal α1,6-fucosyltransferase genes; thus,
the only core fucose is that α1,3-linked to the reducing terminus)
were treated with the recombinant PNGase Ar, and the released N-glycans
separated on a RP-HPLC. In two early eluting fractions (2.3 and 2.4
g.u.), four glycans (Hex4–5HexNAc2Fuc1–2Me0–1; m/z 1297, 1459, 1605, and 1619) were observed by MALDI-TOF
MS (A and B). The MS/MS fragment ions of m/z 608 (Hex1Fuc1HexNAc1–PA)
and the loss of 308 from their parent ions indicated the presence
of a HexFuc unit on the proximal GlcNAc residue (C–F). These
glycans were treated with either α-galactosidase (G) or hydrofluoric
acid (H), and the resulted products were fragmented (I–L).
The sensitivity of these glycans to α-galactosidase and HF treatments
verified that the novel GalαFucα1,3 epitope is present
on the proximal GlcNAc. Non-glycan contaminants are marked with asterisks,
whereas reapplication on RP-HPLC of the two major α-galactosidase
products, Hex3HexNAc2Fuc1–PA
and Hex4HexNAc2Fuc1–PA (m/z 1135 and 1297, eluting at 2.6 and 2.8
g.u., respectively), confirmed their basic structure (Supplementary Figure 4).

Negative-mode ESI-MS/MS was also employed to examine two
isomeric
Hex4HexNAc2Fuc1–PA glycans
(m/z 1295, [M – H]−) proposed to contain a galactosylated core α1,3-fucose (one
found in the fut-6;fut-8 mutant and the other a digestion
product of wild-type m/z 1767; Supplementary Figure 5); both show fragment ions
at m/z 588 and 606 indicative of
galactosylation of the core fucose, but the relative paucity of fragments
for the first isomer and differences in intensity for the second isomer
correlate, as shown in our previous study,13 with either the presence of a bisecting galactose on the core βMan
or with a standard trimannosyl core. The MS3 spectrum for
the ions at m/z 588 (Hex1Fuc1GlcNAc1–PA) displays only one cross-ring
cleavage (m/z 221), which is either 1,3AFuc or 2,4AFuc; thus,
the linkage between the α-galactose (as defined by enzyme digests)
and the core fucose cannot be conclusively defined, but is either
α1,3 or α1,4. In contrast, analysis of a glycan from the fut-1;fut-8 mutant (incapable of adding α1,3-fucose
to the reducing-terminal GlcNAc), has a contrasting fragmentation
pattern as galactosylation of the distal fucose is associated with
fragmentation ions at m/z 435/465/510,
while the m/z 588/606 ions are absent.
Previously, the galactose on the α1,3-fucose at the distal GlcNAc
was proposed to be α1,2-linked based on GC/MS data of a glycan
from a hex-2;hex-3 mutant.16 Thus, the three Gal–Fuc
disaccharide units attached to the chitobiose core are present in
different conformations.

Maximal Degree of Fucosylation of Wild-Type C.
elegans N-Glycans
Previously, five different
fucose linkages on the core region of C. elegans N-glycans have been characterized, i.e., “proximal”
core α1,3- and α1,6-Fuc, distal α1,3-Fuc, α1,2-Fuc
on the bisecting galactose, and α1,2-Fuc on the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6
substitution of the core.14 However, only
maximally four fucoses on a single wild-type glycan have been detected
previously, i.e., on Hex7HexNAc2Fuc4Me0–1.7,38 A thorough examination
of the hydrazine-released N-glycan pool identified glycans of m/z 1897, 1911, 2059, 2073, and 2235 or
of 2333 and 2395 putatively corresponding to Hex5–7HexNAc2Fuc4Me0–1 or Hex6–7HexNAc2Fuc5Me2.
The first five tetrafucosylated masses were also observed in the glycan
pool released by PNGase Ar, whereas the minor pentafucosylated forms
were only detected after hydrazine release. MS/MS of m/z 2235, 2233, and 2395 revealed fragments of, e.g., m/z 770 (Fuc1Hex2GlcNAc1–PA; otherwise previously only detected
in analyses of fut-1;fut-6 and hex-2;hex-3 mutant strains), 1076 (Fuc3Hex2GlcNAc1Me1–PA), and 1078 (Fuc2Hex3GlcNAc1–PA), which means that some of these
glycans contain either an extra hexose or a methylfucose more on the
core than those containing the Galα1,3/4Fucα1,3(Galβ1,4Fucα1,6)GlcNAc
(m/z 916) element. The extra hexose
and methylfucose can be assumed to be a β1,4-galactose or methylated
α1,2-fucose on the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 moiety. Galβ1,4Galβ1,4Fucα1,6
is known from keyhole limpet hemocyanin as well as from previous work
on C. elegans,14,16,39 while the methylfucose is probably α1,2-linked
as in the fut-1;fut-6 and hex-2;hex-3 mutants.14,16 To corroborate the conclusions
as to the numbers of additional galactose and fucose residues, hydrofluoric
acid and galactosidase treatments were performed.

In the case
of the largest tetrafucosylated glycan eluting at 5.2 g.u. (m/z 2235; Hex7HexNAc2Fuc4Me1), MS/MS suggested that more than one
structure was cofragmented, because, in addition to the m/z 916 ion (Fuc2Hex2GlcNAc1–PA), a novel m/z 1078 ion (Fuc2Hex3GlcNAc1–PA)
was seen on the spectrum (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 6). Therefore, the 5.2 g.u. RP-HPLC fractions of the hydrazine and
PNGase Ar pools were reseparated on a HIAX column, which yielded two
overlapping peaks eluting at approximately 20 min (Figure 4B), both containing glycans
of m/z 2235. This procedure allowed
us to demonstrate that two forms of Hex7HexNAc2Fuc4Me1 existed, displaying different sensitivities
to β-galactosidase and HF treatments (Supplementary Figure 6; compare panels A–C and H–J). The less
abundant form is concluded to possess a second β1,4-galactose
on the proximal 6-linked GalFuc, which accounts for the m/z 770/1078 Y1 fragment pair converted
to one at m/z 446/754 upon β-galactosidase
digestion and finally to a sole fragment of m/z 446 after subsequent hydrofluoric acid treatment (Supplementary Figure 6D–G). The major
form of m/z 2235 has an α-galactose
attached to a mannose as compared to the m/z 2059 glycan; thereby both display core fragments at m/z 608/916 converted, respectively, to m/z 608/754, m/z 446/754, and m/z 446
or 608 after α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, and hydrofluoric
acid treatments (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure 6, parts K–N and O–R). Another tetrafucosylated glycan (Hex6HexNAc2Fuc4Me1; m/z 2073) was also shown to have shifts in the Y-fragmentation
(conversion of the m/z 916 ion to
one at m/z 754) upon α-galactosidase
treatment (Figure 4D).

Figure 4 HIAX-HPLC separation of Hex6–7HexNAc2Fuc4Me1 glycans released with hydrazine or
PNGase Ar from wild-type C. elegans glycopeptides. (A) The MS/MS spectrum of m/z 2235 in the 5.2 g.u. RP-HPLC fraction displayed two sets
of Y-fragment ions of m/z 608/916
and m/z 770/1078, suggestive of
cofragmentation of two coeluting isomers. (B) The isomers were separated
by applying the 5.2 g.u. fractions to a HIAX column externally calibrated
with a mixture of oligomannosidic structures (Man4–9GlcNAc2). (C) MS/MS spectra of the m/z 2235 structures in the HIAX fractions (a and b) confirmed
that PNGase Ar released the same forms of Hex7HexNAc2Fuc4Me1 as hydrazine, whereby the m/z 916 fragment of the later-eluting isomer
is replaced by one at m/z 754 after
α-galactosidase treatment; for other structural analyses and
digests on these glycans, see Supplementary Figure 6. (D) 2D-HPLC also purified an m/z 2073 Hex6HexNAc2Fuc4Me1 glycan with a fully modified core with three Gal–Fuc
subunits as shown by its MS/MS pattern; the galactose caps on the
proximal and distal α1,3-linked fucose residues were sensitive
to α-galactosidase resulting in a final product of m/z 1749 after extended incubation.

In addition, we have discovered in a trace amount
two glycans at m/z 2233 and 2395
corresponding to pentafucosylated
compositions of Hex6–7HexNAc2Fuc5Me2. MS/MS of these two glycans revealed fragments
of, e.g., m/z 768, 916, and 1076
(Fuc2–3Hex1–2GlcNAc1Me0–1–PA), which means that these glycans
contain an extra methylfucose more on the core than those containing
the Galα1,3/4Fucα1,3(Galβ1,4Fucα1,6)GlcNAc
element. Hydrofluoric acid treatment resulted in both cases in loss
of the m/z 1076 fragment, which
would correlate with removal of the hexosylated reducing-terminal
core α1,3-fucose in addition to a α1,2-linked methylfucose
(Figure 5). On the
basis of these data, we conclude that all five known linkages of fucose
can be detected on at least two hydrazine-released N-glycans synthesized
by the wild-type worm, which might be the maximal degree of fucosylation
of C. elegans N-glycans.

Figure 5 Maximal degree
of fucosylation in wild-type C. elegans N-glycans. (A) The 6.1 g.u. fraction contained glycans of Hex6–7HexNAc2Fuc5Me2 (m/z 2233 and 2395) which both displayed
a novel MS/MS fragment at m/z 1076
(Hex2GlcNAc1Fuc3Me1–PA;
C and E) in addition to one at m/z 768 (Hex1HexNAc1Fuc2Me1–PA). (B) HF treatment resulted in sequential loss of two
GalFuc units (308 Da) and, in the case of the m/z 2395 glycan, also a methylfucose (160 Da), leading to
products with m/z 1925, 1779, and
1617/1619 whose MS/MS indicated loss of the m/z 1076 fragment (D, F–G). The two HF products at m/z 1617 (from m/z 2233, black-dashed arrows) and 1619 (from m/z 2395, red dashed arrows) were cofragmented, displaying
two diagnostic ions (m/z 608 and
768) with equal intensities; the methylated fucose at the bisecting
position was more resistant to HF treatment than the one on the core
Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 motif. Asterisks in part B indicate non-glycan
contaminants, whereas those in parts C and E indicate a PC-containing
fragment (m/z 369; PC–HexNAc)
originating from coeluting glycans.

Conclusion
From this study, we conclude that the recently
introduced PNGase
Ar enzyme can release the same GalαFucα1,3 reducing-terminal
core modification as hydrazine, but without the complications (safety,
artifacts, and cleanup) as the chemical method. Indeed, peeling of
core residues from plant N-glycans,19 deacylation
(requiring subsequent re-N-acetylation), and partial demethylation
of phosphorylcholine (our own unpublished observations) are problems
associated with the use of hydrazine. Due to subsequent labeling of
the reducing end, the Y1 fragment ions are highly diagnostic
of the various core modifications we have found in this and other
studies, the key example in this study being the core fragment at m/z 916 (Gal2Fuc2GlcNAc1–PA). The combination of off-line LC–MS
and chemical/enzymatic treatments leads us to conclude that the presence
of both GalαFucα1,3 and modified GalβFucα1,6
moieties can only be detected after use of either hydrazine or PNGase
Ar.

Although the PNGase A and Ar enzymes are both of plant origin,
only the latter is capable of releasing glycans with core m/z 916 fragments; apparently, PNGase Ar
can also deglycosylate intact glycoproteins,40 which is an indication that it is less fastidious regarding its
substrates. Thereby, it is interesting to note that substitutions
of the 3-OH of the Asn-bound GlcNAc have different effects on the
ability to cleave N-glycans; thus, while an unsubstituted core α1,3-fucose
can be cleaved by both PNGase A and PNGase Ar, a core β1,3-mannose
motif as found in a marine snail is also sensitive to PNGase F.41 Obviously, the exact modifications of the reducing
terminus do have an impact on what methods can be used for N-glycan
release. Certainly, PNGase Ar should prove a convenient tool in order
to efficiently cleave a wider range of glycans than other PNGase enzymes
and so generally increase our knowledge about glycomic complexities
in invertebrate species.

Our data also expand the range of C. elegans glycans to pentafucosylated forms, whereby
it is to be noted that
pentafucosylated structures with an additional fucose residue on the
6-linked GalFuc element were only released by hydrazine. On the other
hand, having performed both enzymatic (PNGase F and A, but not Ar)
and chemical release of the N-glycans from another nematode, Oesophagostomum dentatum, and not finding the GalαFucα1,3-element,29 it can only be speculated whether this modification
is to be found in any parasitic nematode or whether it is specific
to C. elegans. Certainly, the model
nematode still represents a source of glycomic surprises, which must
then be combined with other studies to reveal why a simple organism
needs so much variation in its oligosaccharide structures.
