Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI) is used for the multiplex detection and characterization
of diverse analytes over a wide mass range directly from tissues.
However, analyte coverage with MALDI MSI is typically limited to the
more abundant compounds, which have m/z values that are distinct from MALDI matrix-related ions. On-tissue
analyte derivatization addresses these issues by selectively tagging
functional groups specific to a class of analytes, while simultaneously
changing their molecular masses and improving their desorption and
ionization efficiency. We evaluated electrospray deposition of liquid-phase
derivatization agents as a means of on-tissue analyte derivatization
using 2-picolylamine; we were able to detect a range of endogenous
fatty acids with MALDI MSI. When compared with airbrush application,
electrospray led to a 3-fold improvement in detection limits and decreased
analyte delocalization. Six fatty acids were detected and visualized
from rat cerebrum tissue using a MALDI MSI instrument operating in
positive mode. MALDI MSI of the hippocampal area allowed targeted
fatty acid analysis of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and the
CA1 pyramidal layer with a 20-μm pixel width, without degrading
the localization of other lipids during liquid-phase analyte derivatization.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI)1 is a sensitive, multiplex,
and nontargeted approach
for the detection and characterization of a wide range of analytes
in a variety of biological and clinical samples. MSI uses several
ionization techniques, including secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS),
laser desorption/ionization (LDI), desorption electrospray ionization
(DESI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).2 Of these, MALDI provides the widest mass range3−6 while obtaining micrometer-scale spatial resolution and detection
limits comparable to other MSI approaches.7,8 MALDI
MSI is well suited for the simultaneous localization of small metabolites,3,4 lipids,9 and peptides10 in tissues. The resultant multiplex chemical images help
to reveal molecular mechanisms of disease,11 facilitate biomarker discovery,12 and
enable tracking of specific molecular classes such as cell–cell
signaling molecules.13

Although MALDI
MSI has many advantages, the method does have some
shortcomings. It is limited by sensitivity (impacting lower concentration
analytes) and is subject to matrix interference in the low m/z range,14 delocalization of analytes during matrix deposition, and ion suppression
from more abundant molecules.15 An example
of the potential limitation of MALDI MSI has been in the investigation
of fatty acids, critical components of lipid metabolism that are incorporated
in triacylglycerides of fat droplets stored in the cytosol of adipocytes.
Free fatty acids (FFAs)16 are involved
in the synthesis of different structural and signaling molecules that
are critical for various cellular processes such as lipid and glucose
metabolism. However, because of their low molecular weight (200–400
Da), low abundance in tissue, and poor ionization efficiency, direct
MALDI MSI of these molecules in tissues using traditional matrixes
such as 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) or 9-aminoacridine (9-AA)
has been challenging. A variety of low-background MALDI MS matrixes,
e.g., silicon nanoparticles,17 graphite,18 pencil lead,19 powdered
carbon aerogels,20 silver/gold nanoparticles,21,22 and graphene,23 have been introduced
and applied to fatty acid detection, resulting in high coverage and
sensitivity for FFAs.18,20,23 However, these techniques may restrict detection of other classes
of analytes compared to traditional matrixes,24 frequently due to their affinity for specific classes of molecules21,22,25 or fragmentation of higher molecular
weight analytes.26,27 Moreover, few of these approaches
have been applied to the characterization of FFAs by MSI.21,22 Time-of-flight (TOF)-SIMS is commonly utilized for FFA imaging in
tissue sections but typically fragments large molecular ions.28,29 For MALDI-based imaging, high-mass resolution instruments such as
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)30,31 can discriminate FFAs from MALDI matrix interference in brain tissue
sections. Because of the high cost and low sampling rate, FTICR may
not be suitable for some analyses; therefore, an efficient MALDI-TOF
MSI method that is sensitive to FFAs using a traditional MALDI matrix
would be a valued alternative.

On-tissue or in-tissue chemical
derivatization methods have been
developed for MALDI MSI to improve sensitivity for specific classes
of biomolecules. These techniques utilize a molecular tag that reacts
with analytes of interest to increase the molecular mass of small
molecules and enhance their ionization efficiency.32−36 In highly selective reactions, other endogenous compounds
are left unchanged, enabling MALDI MS using a traditional matrix and
producing mass spectra comparable with the underivatized data available
in MS databases. In prior studies,32,33,35−37 derivatization reagents have
been deposited onto tissue via spray or sublimation. Several other
protocols have been described. In one, tissues are placed in a chamber
containing solvent vapor to develop the chemical reaction for 10–60
min; the derivatization provides high yields but the extended derivatization
time may lead to analyte delocalization.15 Another option utilizes an automated microspotting device to deposit
the derivatization reagent in picoliter-volume droplets onto the tissue.34 The spatial resolution of MSI in this case is
limited by the distance between individual spots as well as solution
deposition and incubation times. As a final example, a derivatization
reagent was applied on the sample plate before tissue thaw-mounting,
without extended reaction in a chamber, and produced images at 50-μm
spatial resolution.38 Oftentimes analyte
derivatization reactions proceed too slowly or have specific requirements
for solution composition, making them less suitable for derivatization
reagent precoating. Many MSI methods that use derivatization have
produced spatial resolutions poorer than 100 μm.

Here
we describe an alternative derivatization approach based on
electrospray deposition. Electrospray39−41 forms a plume of microdroplets,
emitted from a solution placed in contact with one electrode and directed
toward a second electrode, with high potential differences between
the two. The resulting droplets often have diameters in the nanometer
range.40 Electrospray is widely used as
a soft ionization method but also is suitable as a solvent and solute
deposition method. Earlier studies utilized electrospray for MALDI
matrix deposition in MSI applications,31,42,43 but due to rapid drying of the small droplets, this
deposition method substantially limited analyte incorporation into
the matrix.31 Guo et al.30 recently described a related technique where an electric
field was applied while depositing matrix by piezoelectric nebulization,
enhancing the detection of small molecules.

Using electrospray
deposition, we applied reagents for in situ derivatization
and extraction of fatty acids from
well-defined tissue areas in the rat brain. We expected that implementing
the electrospray without a sheath gas would generate highly charged,
nanoscale derivatization reagent droplets with enhanced extraction
and derivatization efficiencies for fatty acids while maintaining
native FFA distributions. We used 2-picolylamine (PA) to derivatize
fatty acids by forming an amide bond with the carboxyl group of FFAs
in the presence of 2,2-dipyridyl disulfide (DPDS) and triphenylphosphine
(TPP). The reaction occurs quickly over a broad temperature range
(20–60 °C), making it suitable for in situ derivatization.44,45 Our results not only demonstrate
the effectiveness of electrospray deposition of derivatization agents
onto biological specimens, the approach achieved improved sensitivity
compared to traditional airbrush application and a spatial resolution
of 20 μm for the multiplex analysis of FFAs with MALDI MSI.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, purity ≥98%),
linolenic acid (purity ≥99%), linoleic acid (purity ≥99%),
and palmitoleic acid (purity ≥98.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Stock solutions (1 mg/mL) of the standards were prepared
in acetonitrile (ACN) and stored at −20 °C. The ACN, water,
acetic acid (all liquid chromatography (LC)/MS grade), and ammonium
acetate (purity ≥97%) were from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). The TOF mass analyzer was calibrated with the Bruker Daltonics
Inc. (Billerica, MA) Peptide Calibration Standard II (containing bradykinin,
angiotensin II, angiotensin I, substance P, bombesin, ACTH clip 1-17,
ACTH clip 18-39, renin substrate, and somatostatin 28). The derivatization
reagent PA (purity ≥99%) and activation reagent TPP (purity
≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the activation
reagent DPDS (purity ≥98%) was acquired from Tokyo Chemical
Industry (Tokyo, Japan); 9-AA (purity ≥98%) and DHB (purity
≥98%) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Tissue Preparation
and Sectioning
Tissues were harvested
from four male Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis,
IN), 1–3 months old, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle
and fed normal chow ad libitum. Euthanasia by decapitation
was performed in compliance with local and federal regulations and
according to animal use protocols approved by the Illinois Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

In all cases, the brains were
surgically dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80
°C until use. Coronal tissue sections, 18-μm thick, were
prepared from frozen cerebrum using a cryostat (3050S, Leica Biosystems
Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) at −19 °C and thaw-mounted onto
conductive indium–tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Delta
Technologies, Loveland, CO).

Details on the preparation and
usage of the four animals are described
in the in the Supporting Information. While
most samples were analyzed immediately following preparation, some
sections were stored at −80 °C for later use. Optical
images of the tissues were taken using a flatbed scanner (Epson Perfection
V300, Epson America, Inc., Long Beach, CA) with a resolution of 2400
dpi before MSI. The optical images shown in Figure 3 were adjusted to aid in visualization of
hippocampal structures using Adobe Photoshop 2014.

Sample Preparation
for MALDI MSI
Samples were thawed
and dried in an N2-filled desiccator for 20 min. For the
optimization experiments, 2 μL of DHA standard solutions with
gradient concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 12.5 ng/mm2 were deposited on one slide and then dried in an N2-filled
desiccator for 20 min. The derivatization solution, comprised of 2
mM of the derivatization reagent (PA) with 10 mM of the activation
reagents (TPP and DPDS) in ACN, was applied on the specimen by electrospray
or airbrush. Electrospray was performed with a laboratory-constructed
system (Figure S1A). The derivatization
solution was delivered through a fused-silica capillary (250-μm
inner diameter (i.d.), 365-μm outer diameter) electrospray emitter
via a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Holliston, MA) at variable
flow rates (0.5–4 mL/h), with deposition times lasting between
1–5 min. An optimized high voltage (6000 V) was applied to
the spray nozzle with the tissue-coated slide held at ground to generate
a stable Taylor cone at an emitter-to-tissue distance of approximately
3 cm. For airbrush deposition, conditions were selected based on previous
tissue derivatization studies, with minor modifications.32,35,36 Briefly, 1 mL of the derivatization
solution was applied with a 0.2 mm nozzle caliber airbrush (Paasche
Airbrush Company, Chicago, IL), with a nozzle-to-target distance of
50 cm and nozzle nitrogen gas pressure of 20 psi.

Following
derivatization, target plates were coated with MALDI matrix (either
9-AA or DHB) using a laboratory-constructed sublimation system (Figure S1B), similar to previously published
work,46 with some modifications.47 The detailed procedure is described in the Supporting Information. The final matrix thickness
was ∼500 μg/cm2, determined by comparing tissue
weight before and after sublimation.

For comparison to the underivatized
samples, the matrix was deposited
by sublimation using identical conditions, except that the DHB sublimation
required a coating time of 11.5 min and 9-AA required 15 min.

Sample
Preparation for LC–Tandem MS (MS/MS)
Unused tissue
that remained after sectioning for MALDI MSI was punched
with a tissue punch (1 mm i.d.) while the tissue remained frozen in
the cryostat. Punches were taken at specific regions: the isocortex,
hippocampal formation, thalamus, fiber tract, olfactory area, and
hypothalamus. The length of each tissue punch was determined with
a microslide field finder and used in estimating sample volume. Punches
were homogenized in 600 μL of ethanol with 10 min of sonication
on ice in a bath sonicator (8891 Ultrasonic Cleaner, Cole-Parmer,
Vernon Hills, IL). The extracts were centrifuged at 6600g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected and
divided into three equal aliquots for three replicate measurements
after the following sample preparation steps: extract solutions were
dried with a gentle N2 stream at ambient conditions; derivatization
solution (200 μL) was added to each dried sample and incubated
for 10 min at room temperature (RT) (RT = 25 °C throughout) for
derivatization. The derivatized extracts (2 μL) were directly
injected into the LC system to validate the MALDI MSI results.

MALDI
MSI, MALDI MS/MS, and LC–MS/MS Analyses
MALDI-TOF
MSI was conducted with an ultrafleXtreme mass spectrometer
(Bruker) equipped with a solid-state UV Smartbeam II laser. The laser
was set to the “ultra” setting with an ∼100-μm
diameter footprint for low-resolution imaging and the “small”
setting with an ∼20-μm diameter footprint for high-resolution
imaging. The acquisition from each pixel was the sum of 1000 laser
shots at 1000 Hz laser frequency, 70% laser intensity, and 120 ns
pulsed ion extraction time. MALDI MS spectra were acquired in the m/z range of 20 to 3000. Laser intensity
and pulsed ion extraction time were selected to optimize peak intensity
while obtaining sufficient mass resolution, here about 5000, in the
mass range between 300 to 400 Da. A mixture of DHB, bradykinin, and
angiotensin II was deposited near to the brain tissue section to minimize
mass error from surface topography. Image acquisition was performed
with flexImaging software (version 3.0, Bruker) using raster steps
between 20 to 300 μm.

MS/MS analysis was used to confirm
the structure of the detected fatty acids. The LIFT mode of the MALDI
mass spectrometer was used with argon as a collision gas and a 2 Da
precursor isolation window.

LC–MS/MS was performed using
an EVOQ Elite triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (Bruker) connected to an Advance UHPLC system (Bruker).
The LC separation conditions, MS detection conditions, and subsequent
quantitation of the LC–MS/MS data are provided in the Supporting Information.

Processing and Statistical
Analysis of MALDI MSI Data
The molecular ion distribution
images of tissue sections were visualized
using flexImaging. MALDI MSI data acquired from triplicate brain slices
from the same rat and thaw-mounted on three separate slides were used
in the statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons of peak intensities
from different brain regions were performed by exporting data from
manually defined regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to the punched
regions analyzed with LC–MS/MS. Mass spectra in each ROI were
imported into ClinProTools (Bruker) with automatic baseline subtraction
and total ion count normalization. Peaks were picked with a signal/noise
threshold greater than 3 on average spectra and matrix-related peaks
were removed. Picked peaks were exported as m/z value-peak intensity tables. Peak intensities were root-mean-square-normalized
prior to calculating mean peak intensities. The mean values were used
to calculate the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the triplicate
measurements. For comparison of the averaged peak intensities of signals
acquired from different brain regions, a two sample t-test was calculated using OriginPro 8.5 (OriginLab Corporation,
Northampton, MA) to determine significant differences between the
average peak intensities of each pair of regions measured in triplicate.
Resulting p-values for each pair were false discovery
rate (FDR)-corrected with a Benjamini and Hochberg’s FDR-controlling
procedure with c(N) = 1.

Results
and Discussion
MALDI MSI of Endogenous FFAs in Rat Brain
Tissue without Derivatization
The ability to detect the tissue
distributions of important signaling
molecules, such as FFAs, leads to improved understanding of the mechanisms
of different cellular processes, including lipid and glucose metabolism.
Although FFAs have been imaged using TOF-SIMS28,29 and MALDI-FTICR-MSI,30,31 a MALDI-TOF MSI method provides
the ability to examine FFA distributions in the context of other biomolecules,
and at lower cost. However, using existing protocols, FFA signals
are obscured by common matrix peaks, which are abundant in the low
mass range. With TOF mass analyzers these signals are difficult to
resolve, making MALDI-TOF MSI of FFAs problematic.18,20,23

To assess the feasibility of underivatized
MSI of FFAs, the MALDI matrixes DHB and 9-AA were applied to rat brain
tissue for negative-mode MSI. As shown in Figure S2, the m/z range corresponding
to important fatty acids (such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid
(AA)) is heavily obscured by numerous background peaks that interfere
with the detection of targeted analytes, particularly with the matrix
9-AA (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the low
ionization efficiency of FFAs and subsequent lower sensitivity in
negative-mode MALDI-TOF MS was exacerbated in chemically and structurally
complex brain tissue. Only m/z values
consistent with oleic acid and erucic acid were detectable in negative
mode with low intensity in rat brain tissue. For DHB-coated tissues
(Figure S2A), no detectable signal was
observed for m/z values corresponding
to targeted fatty acids such as DHA, linoleic acid, and palmitoleic
acid. Several strong background peaks from DHB were detected, overlapping
with fatty acid m/z values consistent
with eicosapentaenoic, arachidonic, and linolenic acids.

Development
of On-Tissue Chemical Derivatization for FFAs with
Electrospray Deposition of Reagents
A prior study45 demonstrated that primary or secondary amino
groups can be condensed with a carboxyl group in the presence of different
activation agents such as DPDS-TPP (also named Mukaiyama A solution).
This reaction proceeds with rapid kinetics when performed in ACN and
reaches equilibrium after 10 min at RT.45 These properties make it appealing as an on-tissue derivatization
scheme.

In our initial, solution-phase derivatization experiments,
a 2 mM PA derivatization reagent with 10 mM DPDS and 10 mM TPP reacted
with five fatty acid standards at RT with equivalent peak intensities
as were observed at 60 °C. The derivatized fatty acids were detected
with a 91 Da mass shift, consistent with the condensation observed
using PA.

A requirement of on-tissue derivatization is rapid
mixing of the
reagents with analytes dispersed throughout the tissue. With spray-based
reagent application, heterogeneous-phase mass transfer is involved
and the reaction is controlled by the diffusion of analyte and reagent
in the solution layer adjacent to the tissue.48,49 Moreover, the reaction time affects the overall reaction efficiency.
Thus, many parameters controlling the reagent diffusion rate and reaction
time, such as droplet size, reagent concentration, and convection
in droplets, will affect the reaction yield and kinetics.

In
previous studies,32,33,35−37 derivatization reagents were applied to tissues with
nebulizing spray- or sublimation-based approaches, followed by incubation
in a reaction chamber saturated with solvent vapor for several hours.
For our chosen reaction scheme, sublimation was not feasible due to
the liquid state of the derivatization reagent at RT. We also expected
that spray application would generate larger, nonuniform droplets
on tissue, leading to FFA delocalization. Analyte delocalization worsens
with the longer incubation time required to fully develop spray-based
derivatization. To reduce these adverse effects, we used electrospray
to apply the derivatization and activation reagents (Figure 1). The electrospray process
generates smaller droplets39−41 than those produced by nebulization
with an airbrush, limiting delocalization of analytes following tissue
impact. Additionally, the charged droplets may impact with higher
velocities due to the electric field,50,51 causing higher
shear stress on impact,52,53 and perhaps facilitating
mixing with the FAs in the tissue. Electrospray deposition appears
to reduce the required reaction time.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of on-tissue analyte
derivatization via
electrospray deposition of reagents. A 250-μm i.d. fused-silica
capillary is used as an emitter in the electrospray system and is
positioned 3 cm above the tissue slice located on an ITO-glass slide.
Inset: the derivatization reaction scheme.

To determine the optimal electrospray conditions for derivatization,
we spotted DHA standard solution on ITO-glass slides and applied our
derivatization reagent employing different electrospray parameters
by varying infusion flow rate, deposition time, and derivatization
reagent concentration (Figure S3). Increasing
the infusion flow rate significantly increased the observed peak intensity.
Furthermore, increasing the deposition time from 1 to 3 min led to
significant improvements in peak intensity, whereas a longer deposition
time of 5 min showed no additional improvement.

However, other
performance metrics are important when applying
electrospray deposition to tissue sections for MSI. While higher flow
rates improve signal intensity, they may also lead to larger droplets,
which cause delocalization of analytes on tissue (Figure S4B,C). A flow rate of 2 mL/h provided a suitable compromise
between intensity and resolution and generated ion images with distinguishable
dentate gyrus layers of the hippocampus area (Figure S4D). Subsequent on-tissue derivatization was performed
at 2 mL/h with 2 mM of the derivatization reagent and 10 mM of the
activation agents, with a 3 min deposition time. With the optimized
conditions, a limit of detection for DHA down to about 8 pg/mm2 can be obtained with good linearity (R2 = 0.9921) over a range of 150 pg/mm2 to 6.25 ng/mm2 (Figure S3D).

Comparison
of Electrospray and Airbrush Derivatization Reagent
Applications
To compare imaging results between airbrush
and electrospray applications, low-resolution images (300 μm)
(Figure 2A,B) and high-resolution
images (20 μm) (Figure 3B–E) were obtained for
each sample set. For low-resolution imaging, standard spots and select
subregions of the cerebrum were chosen as ROIs for further statistical
analysis. The airbrush-treated samples had significantly lower intensity
than the electrospray (p < 0.05) for standard
spots (n = 3) and for three distinct cerebrum subregions
(Figure 2C).

electrospray, and 3 = no derivatization, showing the spatial resolution
and lipid delocalization before and after derivatization. Scale bars
(B–E) = 1000 μm.

To compare the spatial resolution of each approach, a 20-μm
laser and raster size were used. As shown in Figure 3B-1, C-1, several spots of high intensity
are present following the airbrush application, perhaps from a nonuniform
deposition of large reagent droplets. In contrast, electrospray deposition
displays clear localization of DHA, AA, and two phosphatidylcholine
(PC) lipids to specific cell layers of the hippocampus (Figure 3B-2–E-2) according to
our optical images and known brain anatomical structures.54 We can localize FFAs to specific layers on the
order of 20 μm, the same as our raster spacing. Thus, it appears
electrospray deposition does not lead to obvious delocalization of
fatty acids during sample preparation.

MALDI-TOF MSI of FFAs in
Rat Brain Tissue with On-Tissue Chemical
Derivatization
Using the optimized conditions, another rat
cerebrum was sectioned for on-tissue derivatization experiments. MALDI
MS images (Figure 4B), at low resolution (100 μm) of the entire cerebrum and high
resolution (20 μm) for the hippocampus area, were acquired in
positive mode, with a representative spectrum shown in Figure 4A. Following on-tissue derivatization,
nine fatty acids were detected, including seven unsaturated fatty
acids (DHA, AA, oleic acid, linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic
acid, and linoleic acid) and two saturated fatty acids (stearic acid
and palmitic acid). The FFAs were putatively identified in
situ with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. As shown in Figure 4C, the MS/MS mass spectra of
derivatized fatty acid standards display a characteristic fragment
at m/z 108, also detected in rat
tissue samples, which corresponds to the derivatization reagent [PA
(C5H4NCH2NH2)]+ following amide bond cleavage.44 Most
MS/MS spectra of detected fatty acids in tissue have identical fragments
with that of DHA standards (Figure S5),
except linoleic acid and linolenic acid, which also had several other
abundant fragments, presumably from isobaric precursor ions. We performed
MS/MS, although the detailed structures of many fatty acids can be
difficult to determine given the possible occurrence of fatty acid
isomers. In the case of DHA, we confirmed our assignment by examining
its LC, MS, and MS/MS characteristics using a punch from an adjacent
brain tissue slice. In this case, there are no obvious isomers of
DHA in our samples (Figure S6). For the
other fatty acids detected here, their structure was assigned via
the MS and MS/MS data and by referring to prior reports that these
specific fatty acids are found in the mouse brain using a variety
of analytical methods.22,30 Besides LC, ion mobility spectrometry
can be coupled with MS, and fatty acid isomers may be isolated in
real time during imaging.55,56

Figure 4 MSI ion maps and associated
mass spectra obtained using the optimized
electrospray on-tissue derivatization method. (A) Representative spectrum
extracted from the rat cerebrum area. (B) MALDI MSI ion maps over
an extended region at 100-μm spatial resolution (1), followed
by 20-μm spatial resolution images (2) from selected subregions
of the hippocampal area. (C) Representative MALDI MS/MS spectrum from
the same tissue used to confirm the identity of AA.

From the high-resolution MSI shown in Figure 4B-2, reconstructed
ion images for DHA at m/z 419.2
and AA at m/z 395.2 show localization
to the dentate gyrus granule cell
layers and field CA1 pyramidal layer.54 Eicosapentaenoic acid at m/z 393.2,
palmitic acid at m/z 347.2, and
palmitoleic acid at m/z 345.2 have
complementary localizations with DHA and AA. While detectable with
derivatization, no FFAs were detected in tissue without derivatization
in positive mode. To demonstrate the reproducibility of this method
with different animals, tissue slices from two more rats were examined
using the same approach. Most of the FFAs were detected in cerebrum
tissue of all three rats (Figure S7), and
the relative levels and localization of those FFAs are similar.

Additionally, using electrospray as the deposition method, several
high molecular weight lipids containing these FFAs were detectable
both before (Figure 3D-3,E-3 and Figure S8A) and after (Figure 3D-2,E-2 and Figure S8C) on-tissue derivatization with similar
spatial distributions and resolution. The ion images of two PCs at m/z 844.6 (Figure 3D) and m/z 872.6 (Figure 3E)
(both possibly containing DHA57) are qualitatively
unchanged following derivatization. MS/MS spectra of most of the detected
PCs in Figure 4A are
presented in Figure S9.

In order
to quantify the changes in intensity and spatial distribution
associated with derivatization, principal component analysis was performed
for 12 lipids found in four anatomical regions (the MS and MS/MS spectra
are shown in Figure 4A and Figure S9). As seen in Figure S10, spectra tended to group together
in the score plot based on anatomical region, irrespective of derivatization.
They also were well separated from each other for some brain regions.
To further characterize these lipids, tissues were also interrogated
with MALDI MS/MS at the m/z values
of potential lipid precursors (Figure S9). The main fragment at m/z 184
corresponds to the phosphocholine headgroup [PO3–CH2–CH2–N(CH3)3]+. Among the lipids, m/z 844.6 and 826.7 have additional fragments with a loss of m/z 59 corresponding to [N(CH3)3]. Previous studies on mouse brain utilized MS3 to identify these masses as [PC(diacyl-16:0/22:6) + K]+ and [PC(diacyl-18:0/18:1) + K]+.57 Many FFAs comprise the glycerophospholipids in cellular membranes,
suggesting that the distributions of fatty acids should correlate
with these lipids. Our derivatization method, by increasing the sensitivity
of FFAs without changing lipid distributions, may help elucidate such
spatial correlations.

Validation with LC–MS/MS
As MSI does not involve
a separation technique, matrix effects and interference typically
prevent quantitation of results. Furthermore, the derivatization yield
may depend on the surrounding tissue properties. We thus used a complementary
MS approach to compare ion abundance detected in various brain regions
between MSI and a more conventional extraction, derivatization, and
LC–MS/MS procedure. Tissues from the same brain cerebrum (Figure 5B) were prepared
for MALDI MSI (Figure S11A) and for LC–MS/MS
(Figure S11B). The punches were extracted
with ethanol and derivatized in solution with the same derivatization
chemistry and subsequently analyzed by LC–MS/MS. The MSI results
(Figure S11A) were exported and the peak
intensities in regions corresponding to the LC–MS/MS of the
punches (Figure S11B) were grouped and
averaged to generate an estimate of the intensity for each of the
triplicate measurements. The MSI results were compared to the LC–MS/MS
quantitative results (Figure 5A and Figure S11). As expected,
the RSD of the on-tissue derivatization was high, at most 45%, but
typically below 20%. From the comparison of mean values of the MSI
and LC–MS/MS results for DHA, the data are correlated, with
a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.945 (Figure 5A) (fiber tract regions
were excluded due to a different composition/matrix effect compared
to the other brain regions examined). A two sample t-test was performed between different regions for both the MSI and
LC–MS/MS results. The distribution trends in different regions
were similar between the two approaches, and some of the region pairs
had significant differences (p < 0.05) for both
the MSI and LC–MS/MS data from calculated FDR-corrected p values (e.g., the isocortex and olfactory areas). As LC–MS/MS
provides quantitative data, the correlation between LC–MS/MS
and MSI from distinct brain regions demonstrates the ability of our
MALDI MSI approach to accurately provide semiquantitative fatty acid
distributions when matrix effects are minimal.

(n = 3) versus the quantitation via LC–MS/MS
results from different cerebrum regions (n = 3).
(B) Locations used for the comparison: ion map of DHA abundance (using
the same color scale as in Figure 4) and corresponding photo of brain tissue showing punched
regions for the LC–MS/MS measurements. Labels 1 and 7, cortex,

Conclusions
MSI with on-tissue derivatization is an
effective approach to improving
the detectability of molecules with low ionization efficiency, such
as fatty acids, via MALDI-TOF MS in positive mode. The use of electrospray-assisted
derivatization and MALDI MSI provided the ability to detect nine FFAs,
allowing us to distinguish these FFAs between distinct cell layers
of the rat hippocampus, with an effective spatial resolution of about
20 μm. The MSI results were validated by quantitative LC–MS/MS,
which displayed a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between measurements
from the two methods. We expect that electrospray-assisted derivatization
will be effective with a number of different derivatization approaches,
allowing enhanced detection and imaging of different classes of analytes.
