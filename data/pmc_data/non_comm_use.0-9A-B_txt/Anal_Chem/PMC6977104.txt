Primary
hyperoxalurias (PH) are inborn errors of glyoxylate metabolism
characterized by an increase in endogenous oxalate production. Oxalate
overproduction may cause calcium-oxalate crystal formation leading
to kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and ultimately kidney failure.
Twenty-four hour urine oxalate excretion is an inaccurate measure
for endogenous oxalate production in PH patients and not applicable
in those with kidney failure. Treatment efficacy cannot be assessed
with this measure during clinical trials. We describe the development
and validation of a gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
method to analyze the samples obtained following a stable isotope
infusion protocol of 13C2-oxalate and 1-13C-glycolate in both healthy individuals and PH patients.
Isotopic enrichments of plasma oxalate, glycolate, and glyoxylate
were measured on a gas chromatography–triple quadrupole mass
spectrometry system using ethylhydroxylamine and N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide
(MTBSTFA) for analyte derivatization. Method precision was good for
oxalate and glycolate (coefficients of variation [CV] were <6.3%
and <4.2% for inter- and intraday precision, respectively) and
acceptable for glyoxylate (CV <18.3% and <6.7% for inter- and
intraday precision, respectively). The enrichment curves were linear
over the specified range. Sensitivity was sufficient to accurately
analyze enrichments. This new method allowed calculation of kinetic
features of these metabolites, thus enabling a detailed analysis of
the various pathways involved in glyoxylate metabolism. The method
will further enhance the investigation of the metabolic PH derangements,
provides a tool to accurately assess the therapeutic efficacy of new
promising therapeutic interventions for PH, and could serve as a clinical
tool to improve personalized therapeutic strategies.

==== Body
Primary hyperoxalurias (PH)
are rare inborn errors of glyoxylate metabolism characterized by increased
endogenous oxalate production. In PH type 1, which is the most common
form of PH, the liver-specific enzyme alanine:glyoxlyate aminotransferase
(AGT) either malfunctions or is deficient. This results in the inability
to form glycine from glyoxylate, which causes the body to produce
increased levels of the metabolic end product, oxalate. Oxalate is
duly excreted by the kidneys, but increased urinary oxalate levels
will cause nephrocalcinosis, urolithiasis, and ultimately renal failure.
Once renal function starts to decrease, blood oxalate levels increase,
and calcium-oxalate crystals are deposited throughout the body. Accumulation
of oxalate crystals in various tissues causes widespread damage and
organ dysfunction, most notably in the bones, eyes, and heart, a condition
referred to as systemic oxalosis.

Until now, oxalate production
could only be assessed by means of
urinary oxalate excretion rates. It is well-known that the daily urinary
oxalate excretion may vary up to 36% within PH patients.1 Furthermore, 24-h urine collections are cumbersome
and fraught by collection inaccuracies. Once calcium-oxalate crystals
have accumulated in various bodily tissues, hyperoxaluria may persist
for years despite the fact that the primary metabolic defect may have
been corrected following liver transplantation.2,3 Even
though the enzyme function may have been restored, remobilization
of stored oxalate from bone and other tissues contributes to the appearance
of oxalate in plasma and thus in urine.

Despite many decades
of research into the metabolic pathways involved
in oxalate synthesis, uncertainties still remain regarding the metabolic
alterations of the various PH subtypes. Also, at this moment, new
therapeutic modalities for PH are under investigation.4,5 Measuring the various pathways involved in glyoxylate metabolism
and oxalate production would allow for the reliable and fast assessment
of the therapeutic effects of various new drugs. Accurate measurements
would also enhance the understanding of the affected PH-associated
metabolic pathways and metabolites, possibly yielding new therapeutic
interventions or drug targets.

Stable isotopes provide an ideal
instrument for the analysis of
deranged metabolic processes and have found widespread application
in the study of inborn metabolic diseases.6

Previously, hyperoxaluria metabolism has been studied using
both
radioactive7 and stable isotopes.8−11 In most of these studies, isotopic enrichment was determined in
urine metabolites following intravenous (iv) administration of tracer,7,9−11 which only allows for the assessment of the relative
contribution of the injected tracer to the measured urinary compound.
Huidekoper et al. were the first to directly measure endogenous oxalate
production rates by applying a primed continuous infusion protocol
of 13C2-oxalate and measuring tracer enrichments
in plasma.8 However, doubts have risen
about stable isotopic dosing and analytical methods used in this study.
For instance, a stable isotopic plateau was not attained in all PH
patients, and the rate of appearance of oxalate was higher than expected
and did not match 24-h oxalate excretion rates in the healthy volunteers.
The isotope infusion protocol was revised and upgraded by the concurrent
administration of 1-13C-glycolate with 13C2-oxalate. Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of the glycolate/glyoxalate/oxalate
metabolism, shown with the different isotopic labels used during this
study, in which both healthy volunteers and PH1 patients received
a primed, continuous infusion of 13C2-oxalate
and 1-13C-glycolate. Total oxalate and glycolate production
rates were determined by primed, continuous infusion of 13C2-oxalate and 1-13C-glycolate, respectively.
The 1-13C-glycolate tracer can be metabolized into 1-13C-glyoxylate, 1-13C-oxalate, and 1-13C-glycine. In addition to the absolute oxalate and glycolate production
rates, this protocol also provides information on the relative contributions
to the production rates of the conversion of glycolate into oxalate,
glyoxylate, and glycine. This outcome would provide important information
for future drug trials since these specific contributions are hypothesized
to be altered when AGT function is restored in PH type 1 patients.

Our paper describes a newly developed and validated analysis method
for the measurement of 1-13C-glyoxylate, 1-13C-glycolate, 1-13C-oxalate, and 13C2-oxalate isotopic enrichment. 1-13C-Glycine enrichment
for the isotope infusion protocol was analyzed using a previously
developed method.12−14 For glyoxylate, glycolate, and oxalate, several different
derivatization techniques and sample preparation methods were investigated.
Most of the candidate reagents showed insufficient sensitivity for
providing an accurate analysis in plasma, or these three compounds
could not be concurrently derivatized. Furthermore, during the optimization
process, various candidate chemical reagents used for sample preparation
were found to contain traces of the compounds to be measured. We developed
a new sample preparation method by combining sample cleanup and two
derivatization steps, and a new method for gas chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) operated in a multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode. Using this method, we were able to analyze
samples obtained with the new stable isotope infusion procedure.

Materials
and Methods
Reagents
Hydrochloric acid (37%, Merck, Germany), o-ethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (Aldrich, Germany), double
distilled water (Elga, U.K.), sodium chloride (Merck, Germany), ethyl
acetate for GC–MS Suprasolv (Millipore, Germany), N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide
(MTBSTFA) (Aldrich, Germany), acetonitrile LC–MS grade (Biosolve,
The Netherlands), 13C2-oxalate, and 1-13C-glycolate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A.) were purchased
from various sources and used in the experiments.

Infusion Protocol
Both normal healthy volunteers and
PH type 1 patients were studied. Two IV catheters were inserted into
the antecubital vein, one in each arm. One catheter was used to administer
the primed continuous infusions and the other for blood sampling.
A baseline blood sample was collected for background enrichment of
oxalate, glycine, glyoxylate, and glycolate in plasma. Primed continuous
(prime/hourly dose) 13C2-oxalate and 1-13C-glycolate infusions were then started. Blood samples were
drawn hourly, and plasma samples were collected into ice-cooled heparin
tubes and centrifuged within 30 min of collection for 10 min at 1700g and 4 °C. Two-hundred microliters of plasma were
transferred into 2 mL glass screw capped vials, and 30 μL of
concentrated HCl (37%) was added and mixed using a vortex. Immediate
acidification after withdrawal prevents in vitro formation of oxalate
from ascorbic acid.15 The 1-13C-glycolate tracer was infused for 6 h, whereas the 13C2-oxalate tracer infusion lasted 10 h (Figure 2). The study protocol was approved
by the ethical committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Center,
location AMC.

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the infusion protocol. Following
baseline
sampling, a priming dose (1 h dose) is followed by continuous tracer
infusion. Blood was sampled hourly. 1-13C-glycolate was
infused for 6 h and 13C2-oxalate for 10 h.

Standard Preparation
Stock solutions
of oxalate, glycolate,
glyoxylate, and 13C2-glyoxylate were prepared
and stored at −20 °C. For 13C2-oxalate
and 1-13C-glycolate, the infusion solutions were used as
stock solutions. Unfortunately, 1-13C-glyoxylate was not
commercially available, so 13C2-glyoxylate was
used to prepare the calibration curve and control samples. Corrections
were made where necessary for calculations with this isotopomer.

A calibration curve was prepared by adding a fixed amount of a mixture
of the unlabeled standards to different levels of labeled standards
to achieve adequate enrichment levels for this study (ranging from
0% to about 27% tracer-to-tracee ratio [TTR]).

Control Samples
Portions of pooled plasma were spiked
with 13C2-oxalate, 1-13C-glycolate,
and 13C2-glyoxylate for validation purposes
and for monitoring accuracy and precision during the analysis of the
study samples. Purposefully, we used pooled plasma that had not been
treated with HCl to prevent in vitro oxalogenesis. As a consequence,
oxalate and glycolate concentrations present in these pooled plasma
samples were inbetween the concentration ranges for healthy volunteers
and PH1 patients.

Sample Preparation Protocol
Directly
before analysis,
samples were thawed. To 200 μL aliquots of calibration curve
standards and control samples, 30 μL of 12 M HCl was added.
Fifty microliters of a 100 mg/mL ethoxyamine solution in water and
an additional 100 μL of water were added to all samples, including
standard and control samples. The mixture was incubated at 80 °C
for 30 min. After cooling, 50 μL of an NaCl solution (saturated
in water) was added. One milliliter of ethyl acetate was added, and
samples were then vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000g. The top layer was transferred into a clean gas chromatography
(GC) vial. This extraction step was repeated once, and the top layers
from both extractions were combined. The ethyl acetate was evaporated
under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 30 °C. Twenty-five microliters
of MTBSTFA and 25 μL acetonitrile were added, and the mixture
was incubated for 30 min at 80 °C. After cooling, the samples
were transferred into inserts, and immediately analyzed by GC–MS/MS.

GC–MS/MS
A 7890A GC, equipped with a 7693 auto
sampler coupled to a 7000 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Agilent
Technologies, U.S.A.), was used to perform all analyses. The GC was
equipped with a Dean’s switch to reduce contamination of the
source by sending the effluent prior to and after elution of peaks
of interest to the waste. Samples were introduced through a temperature-programmed
multimode inlet. The GC was fitted with a VF17 ms column (30 m, 0.25
mm, 0.25 μm). Through the Dean’s switch, the flow was
either directed to the mass spectrometer (uncoated fused silica capillary,
1.8 m, 0.180 mm) or to waste (uncoated fused silica capillary, 1.3
m, 0.180 mm). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2
mL/min. One microliter of sample was injected per run, and each sample
was analyzed in triplicate. The initial oven temperature was 55 °C
for 1 min. The temperature was then increased by 30 °C/min to
115 °C and held constant for 5 min. It was then increased
by 5 °C/min to 160 °C followed by an increase in temperature
of 30 °C/min to 300 °C, and held constant for 5 min. The
run time was 26.67 min. The system was operated in the MRM mode while
recording the effluent from 9 to 20 min. The precursor ions were selected
with normal resolution (target peak width of 0.7), and the product
ions were selected at a narrower resolution (0.45) to prevent a contribution
from the neighboring m/z value to
the m/z value of interest. All transitions
were recorded with a gain factor of 10. The MRM settings are shown
in Table 1. The ion
source installed was an Electron ionization Extractor Ion Source,
operated at 230 °C and 70 eV. The collision gas was N2 6.0 at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The transfer line temperature
was kept at 280 °C, the temperatures of quadrupoles 1 and 2 were
kept at 150 °C. The acquisition software for operating the GC–MS/MS
was MassHunter GC/MS Acquisition B.07.06.2704. The results obtained
with our new analysis method were expressed as tracer-to-tracee ratio
[TTR] enrichment and were used for calculations of synthesis rates.

Method Validation
The precision
was established by
repeatedly analyzing control samples at two different enrichment levels.
The interday precision was determined by analysis of three replicates
(including preparation and triplicate analysis) of the control samples
on five different days. The intraday precision was determined by analysis
of eight replicates on a single day. We prespecified the maximum allowable
coefficient of variation (CV) as <10% and <15% for intra- and
interday precision, respectively. Due to the low concentrations of
glyoxylic acid in the samples, we allowed the maximum variation coefficient
to be slightly higher (<15% and <20% for intra- and interday
precision, respectively).

Linearity was determined by repeated
analysis of the calibration curves. The integrated peak area for the
tracer was divided by the peak area for the tracee to obtain the experimental
TTR. This was plotted against the theoretical TTR% to obtain a calibration
curve. The R2 value of the regression
analysis over the linear range of this curve should be >0.99
for all compounds, and the slope of this curve should be around 0.01
± 20%, which would provide confirmation that the experimental
TTR is in agreement with the theoretical TTR% value. By definition,
the upper and lower limits of quantification were determined and defined
by the domain of linearity of the enrichment curve and the linear
dynamic range of the instrument. The minimum signal should be >10 S/N, which is the lower limit of quantification.

Data Analysis
Integration of the peak area was performed
using Mass Hunter Quantitative Analysis software version B.08.00 (Agilent,
U.S.A.). Further calculations were performed using Excel 2016 (Microsoft
Corporation, U.S.A.). The slope and intercept of the enrichment curves
(experimental TTR versus theoretical TTR%) were determined by linear
regression analysis.

Results
The high and low control
samples were spiked at 2.7 and 0.6 TTR%
for glyoxylate, 8.6 and 1.3 TTR% for glycolate, and 7.9 and 1.4 for
oxalate. Table 2 presents
detailed information regarding precision assessments. For glycolate,
the intra- and interday precision CVs were <2.4% and <2.2%,
respectively. For oxalate, the intra-and interday precision CVs were
<4.2% and <6.3%, respectively. As expected, the variation for
glyoxylate enrichments was larger than that observed for oxalate and
glycolate (intra- and interday precision CVs <6.7% and <18.3%,
respectively) due to the low concentration of glyoxylate in plasma.
The criteria for maximum allowable coefficients of variation as described
in the Materials and Methods section were
fulfilled.

Linearity was tested by repeated
analysis of the calibration curves
and complied with the validation criteria described in the Materials and Methods section. The R2 value of the enrichment curve over the range analyzed
during the experiments was always >0.99 for all compounds. The
slope
of the curve for all compounds was close to the theoretical value
of 0.01 and within the predefined maximum allowable deviation (average
slope of curves, derivatized and analyzed on five different days:
glyoxylate 0.0114, glycolate 0.0119, and oxalate 0.0110). An example
of a calibration curve for the enrichment of 13C2-oxalate is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Example of a calibration curve for the enrichment of 13C2-oxalate. The integrated peak area for 13C2-oxalate was divided by the peak area for unlabeled
oxalate for the calibration standards to obtain the experimental tracer
to tracee ratio (TTR). These results are plotted against the theoretical
TTR% of the standards. The theoretical value of the slope is 0.01.

The upper and lower limits of quantification were
defined by the
domain of linearity of the enrichment curve (0% to about 27% TTR)
and the linear dynamic range of the instrument. Peaks observed in
calibration standards, control samples, and samples for both healthy
volunteers and PH patients always exceeded the lower limit of quantification
(10 S/N). No samples were observed
to have peak area exceeding the linear dynamic range of the instrument.

Specificity and selectivity were achieved by adequate separation
of the peaks by GC (Figure 4) and choosing MRM transitions specific for the derivatized
compounds. Figure 5 shows the mass spectra for the three compounds. The stability of
derivatized plasma samples was determined over a relevant time frame
(48 h) and showed no significant decline in signal during the measurement
period.

oxalate (in black) and a reagent blank (in gray, dashed line). Glycolate
and oxalate did not react with ethylhydroxylamine, and their derivatization
with MTBSTFA was not affected by the additional reaction needed for
derivatization of glyoxylate. Other peaks present in this chromatogram
were attributed to reagent peaks.

was derivatized with both ethylhydroxylamine and MTBSTFA and glycolate
and oxalate with MTBSTFA (both compounds did not react with ethylhydroxylamine).
For glycolate and oxalate, isotopic labeled positions were lost during
fragmentation, only peaks attributed to the derivatizing agent were
present in the product scan.

Enrichment results analyzed in samples obtained during the stable
isotope infusion protocol are shown in Figure 6. For 5 PH type 1 patients enrolled in the
study, the average enrichments during steady state were 68.8 TTR%
for 1-13C-glycolate, 2.3 TTR% for 1-13C-glyoxylate,
31.1 TTR% for 1-13C-oxalate, and 26.1 TTR% for 13C2-oxalate. The average results for 5 normal healthy volunteers
were 27.7 TTR% for 1-13C-glycolate, 0.4 TTR% for 1-13C-glyoxylate, 0.4 TTR% for 1-13C-oxalate, and
10.8 TTR% for 13C2-oxalate. Steady state was
achieved from 4 to 6 h after start of the primed continuous infusion
for 1-13C-glycolate. For 13C2-oxalate,
this was from 6 to 10 h after start of the infusion.

isotope infusion protocol. Per time point, the results of 5 PH type
1 patients (in black) or healthy volunteers (in gray) were averaged.

Discussion
We describe the development
and validation of a new analysis method
for the measurement of plasma isotopic enrichments following the administration
of multiple tracers to study glyoxylate metabolism.

In a previous
pilot study, Huidekoper et al. applied a stable isotope
procedure similar to the one presented in this work.8 Endogenous oxalate production was determined by infusion
of stable isotope labeled 13C2-oxalate. However,
in hindsight, the infusion procedure and analytical method may have
been inaccurate. The rate of appearance of oxalate was higher than
expected in the healthy volunteer group, and this overestimation could
be attributed to several causes. First, the infusion protocol yielded
low oxalate enrichments in this group, making enrichment measurements
subject to imprecisions inherent in the method. In our new protocol,
a higher infusion rate was administered for healthy volunteers, leading
to higher plasma enrichment and thus to more accurate measurements.
Second, insufficient precautions may have been taken to prevent in
vitro oxalogenesis. If plasma is not acidified directly after withdrawal,
then oxalate will form during storage even when stored at −20
°C or −70 °C.16,17 Ascorbic acid is the
main source of in vitro oxalogenesis, and glyoxylate does not contribute
significantly.17,18 In the healthy volunteer group
with lower plasma oxalate concentrations, especially, this in vitro
oxalogenesis could make a relatively large contribution to the observed
plasma oxalate concentration, leading to a larger bias in the observed
enrichment (which will appear to be lower). By adding HCl directly
after blood withdrawal, in vitro oxalogenesis can be prevented.15 Third, we extended the infusion protocol from
8 to 10 h to ensure achievement of an isotopic plateau in the PH patients.
Further improvement of the protocol from the pilot study was achieved
by concurrent administration of both 1-13C-glycolate and 13C2-oxalate, which gives additional insights into
the fluxes involved in the glyoxylate metabolism.

In order to
analyze the samples obtained with the improved isotope
infusion protocol, we aimed to develop and validate a sensitive and
accurate GC–MS/MS method by combining the enrichment analysis
of oxalate, glyoxylate, and glycolate into one single analysis. As
the new analytical method was developed to analyze enrichments of
oxalate and glycolate in PH1 patients in addition to healthy volunteers,
sufficient sensitivity was needed to determine these compounds in
healthy volunteers (with low plasma concentrations).

Our sample
work up required a combination of sample cleanup and
two consecutive derivatization reactions with ethylhydroxylamine and
MTBSTFA for sufficient sensitivity and accuracy. Measurements of plasma
oxalate, glycolate, and glyoxylate enrichment were performed on a
mass spectrometer operated in MRM mode to improve the performance
of the analysis. The signal-to-noise ratio was increased by MRM as
opposed to the single ion monitoring (SIM) mode, which aids in accurate
quantitation, especially for compounds with low abundance. Preferably,
the isotope labels are present in both the precursor and the product
ion of the MRM transition. For glyoxylate, this was the case. The
mass difference between the precursor and the product could be explained
by the loss of the ethyl group added during the reaction with ethylhydroxylamine.
Unfortunately, for both oxalate and glycolate, all isotope-labeled
positions were lost during fragmentation. However, typical MTBSTFA
fragments (m/z 189, 147, and 73)19 are present after fragmentation. Choosing either
of these as a product ion in an MRM transition improved the signal-to-noise
ratio for these compounds in comparison to SIM analysis. For oxalate, m/z 147 as product ion resulted in the
highest signal-to-noise ratio for the M+2 isotope, whereas for glycolate, m/z 73 as the product ion resulted in the
highest signal-to-noise ratio for the M+1 isotope. The collision energies
were optimized to obtain the highest signal.

The applied method
yielded good precision as assessed by the inter-
and intraday CVs for oxalate and glycolate enrichments and acceptable
precision for glyoxylate (as shown in Table 2). The sensitivity was sufficient to analyze
accurate enrichments of the selected compounds, allowing for the calculation
of endogenous production rates of oxalate and glycolate and the relative
contribution of glycolate to glycine, glyoxylate, and oxalate production
rates.

Sensitivity was the major challenge during the development
of the
new analytical method. Numerous derivatives were investigated, but
only MTBSTFA provided satisfactory results for further development
and optimization of the method. Several derivatization reagents were
tested in our quest to find an optimal GC–MS/MS method. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide
(BSTFA) derivatization has previously been used for the concurrent
analysis of oxalate and glycolate,20,21 however, we
tested MTBSTFA as a derivatization reagent,22,23 as it generally results in higher analytical responses than BSTFA.19 MTBSTFA did indeed show the highest analytical
response of all of the tested reagents. However, the procedure suffered
from contamination during several steps in the derivatization procedure.

Other considered procedures were derivatization with isobutyl chloroformate.24,25 This method was not sensitive enough, especially for analysis of
oxalate at the expected concentration in plasma from healthy volunteers.
Ethyl chloroformate derivatization26,27 showed no
peaks for oxalate, and multiple peaks for glycolate.28,29 Derivatization with both benzyl alcohol30 and methanolic HCl31 were not sensitive
enough for accurate measurement at the expected plasma concentrations. o-Phenylenediamine32 can be used
in combination with MTBSTFA and undergoes an additional reaction with
oxalate. However, the isotope pattern observed in the mass spectrum
for glyoxylate showed interfering peaks. After derivatization with o-phenylenediamine in combination with acetylation, no peak
for oxalic acid was observed. Both iso- and n-propanol
derivatization16,33−36 showed unexplained spectra for
the isotope labeled compounds of interest.

The common denominator
for rejection of these derivatives was the
lack of sufficient sensitivity. The concentration of the analytes
to be measured was very low in plasma, especially for healthy volunteers.
The difficulty of finding a suitable derivatization reagent with enough
analytical response for our compounds of interest when using GC–MS
with an electron ionization ion source could be explained by the small
molecular sizes of oxalate, glycolate, and glyoxylate. Typically,
extensive fragmentation occurs with electron ionization, and due to
the small molecular size of the compounds of interest, the use of
many of the investigated derivatization reagents can result in small
unspecific mass fragments. These unspecific fragments can lead to
sensitivity and specificity issues. Moreover, with GC–MS/MS
there is an additional fragmentation step, creating even smaller fragments.
It was found to be particularly challenging when trying to obtain
a favorable mass spectrum with high abundant and specific mass fragments
for all three compounds of interest in one single analysis. Therefore,
our requirement to concurrently determine glycolate, oxalate, and
glyoxylate in one single analysis was in some cases also the reason
to reject a potential candidate reagent for derivatization.

Of the tested reagents, only derivatization with MTBSTFA led to
suitable mass fragmentation spectra for all compounds (Figure 5) with its characteristic high
abundant M-57 peak.19 This peak was selected
as the precursor ion in the MRM analysis for each of the compounds
(Table 1). However,
due to contamination problems in this derivatization protocol, optimization
of the sample preparation procedure was needed to reduce contamination
to a minimum. Both ethyl acetate (used for liquid–liquid extraction)
and MTBSTFA turned out to be especially important sources of contamination
as they contained both oxalate and glycolate. Chemicals obtained from
several suppliers and of higher purity grades were evaluated for impurities.
Combining the cleanest available chemicals with a reduction in the
volume of ethyl acetate during liquid–liquid extraction and
reducing the volume of MTBSTFA by adding acetonitrile during the derivatization,
we managed to significantly reduce contamination. In the present study,
the contribution of the reagents to the unlabeled signal was calculated
to be <5% for healthy volunteers. We found this to be acceptable
because this fell within the range of typical biological variations.
For PH patients, the relative contribution to the signal was negligible.

With MTBSTFA derivatization alone, glyoxylate cannot be observed
by GC–MS. Addition of a derivatization step with ethylhydroxylamine
to the MTBSTFA protocol made it possible to also analyze glyoxylate
in the same analytical procedure without negatively affecting oxalate
and glycolate results. Both derivatization of hydroxylamine and ethylhydroxylamine
were successful, but the elution window of the derivate after reaction
with ethylhydroxylamine was more favorable than that obtained by hydroxylamine.
Ethylhydroxylamine was tested with both water and pyridine in the
reaction medium. The reaction in the watery phase gave the cleanest
extracts when measured in full scan mode. A total ion current chromatogram
is depicted in Figure 4 showing the separation of the peaks of the three analytes of interest.

When analyzing a sample with a low enrichment directly after analyzing
a highly enriched sample, there was a noticeable oxalate-related memory
effect. This was easily solved by performing additional injections
of the lower enriched sample or adding a few blank injections. As
this analysis is to be applied to samples obtained following primed
continuous infusion, sample enrichment (such as low versus high) is
predictable, and the problem can be prevented by scheduling blank
injections within the sequence when there is a large expected downward
shift in sample enrichment.

The described isotope infusion protocol
will serve multiple purposes
for improving our understanding of PH molecular pathophysiology, which
will revitalize the research in this field and hence support optimal
treatment for all PH patients. First, we now have a strong tool that
will play a pivotal role in further elucidating and mapping of glyoxylate
metabolism. Despite decades of research into PHs, a number of uncertainties
still exist. A major caveat remains the contribution of different
precursors on endogenous oxalate production, which could be answered
with a multiple tracer infusion. We are now able to assess the contribution
of glycolate as a source for endogenous oxalate production. Second,
our method could also be used to evaluate therapeutic efficacies for
new therapeutic modalities using substrate inhibition (by sRNAi) that
are presently under investigation.4,5,11 Instead of using surrogate end points (such as urinary
oxalate excretion and/or plasma oxalate concentration), we can now
quantify the decrease in endogenous oxalate production to proof efficacy.
Finally, our method could also play a crucial role in clinical decision-making.
We are now able to assess pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) responsiveness in
a noninvasive manner (in contrast to performing a liver biopsy) as
these patients do have residual AGT enzyme activity. We can prove
pyridoxine responsiveness by finding a lower endogenous oxalate production
(from glycolate) as compared to non-B6 responders, but more importantly
we can also prove that the conversion of 1-13C-glyoxylate
to 1-13C-glycine occurs.

Conclusion
We
developed a valid GC–MS/MS method for the precise and
sensitive analysis of oxalate, glycolate, and glyoxylate enrichment
following a primed, continuous infusion of 13C2-oxalate and 1-13C-glycolate. This method will allow for
the analysis of glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate metabolism in both
healthy subjects and PH patients. The isotope procedure is indispensable
for testing therapeutic effects of treatment within a short time-span
in PH1 patients. Moreover, it provides quantitative data on how much
activity of the defective enzyme is recovered. This is invaluable
information in studies on new drugs, and it opens possibilities for
assessing the efficacy of drugs for PH1 patients. The information
obtained from these new developments may be a breakthrough in treating
PH patients and probably can prevent patients from having a liver
and/or kidney transplant.
